your seats for a few minutes I pray you're excited to be in the house of the Lord you know it it it doesn't matter how many we are what matters is that there's a scripture and the Bible says that where two or three are Gather in my name I will be there now he said that so we can have Fellowship that's his word so I'm excited to be here I I love brother Daniel he's been a good uh mentor to me you know he's an elder in the message and so sometimes um you know I I'm I'm just in the beginning stages of preaching I don't know much but that doesn't matter you know the Bible brother Bram said he was asked the question how much of the Bible he knew and his response was it doesn't matter how much of the Bible I know I know real well that's my heart's desire amen so my name is brother Cosman I have my my lovely wife here we have four girls we got a brother David mcgary's Church M we bring greetings for Brother David McGary David McGary but we have four daughters and my oldest is 14 my youngest is eight and it's a lot of work it's four it's four girls but I'm blessed because God gave me his love to love them but I don't want to forget about my my newborn Edition that's coming and and and so my wife is is is pregnant at the moment and and the Lord's given me a boy I already know his name his name is goingon to be Gideon I've been waiting for him and this is the promised son and I'm excited and U I love my wife she's been always faithful to me she's always been the love of my life and you know sometimes um you realize after a while that the the more you grow together the more you love each other because love is a relationship so I just thank her for just being here with me I know it's not easy so I wanted to speak a little bit I know that we have Christmas time and this is what the world says it's Christmas time it's not really Christmas time because brother Bram said that Jesus was born somewhere around April or May but it's it's the season this is the this is the way people celebrate and you know it's never late or not too much to talk about the Lord Jesus Christ he should be our Our Testimony every day amen amen so we're just going to take an opportunity tonight and talk to you about unto us a son is given unto us a son was given so let's just stand stand tonight and turn to Isaiah chapter 7 is there going to be familiar scriptures to you and so um I just want you to walk along with us tonight and enjoy the word of God the word of God is made for us to enjoy it it's peace it's love it's it's all these attributes of God that he wants to express to us and so just follow along try to try to try to uh dine in together all that we know is open we're just sharing it there's nothing new everything's already been accomplished it just takes this time for us to walk into and fulfill the Plan of Redemption so what we're doing is fellowshiping the word that we're supposed to fulfill it's our time it's our hour it's it it's the time we're living in so Isaiah 7 ver 13- 16 and he said verse 13 and he said hear ye now oh House of David it is a small thing for you to weary me will ye weary My God also therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel butter and honey shall he eat that he may know that refuse to refuse the evil and to choose the good for the child for before before the child shall know to Res to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou up horest shall be forsaken of both her Kings so we now realize that Isaiah just spoke a word it was the word of of Prophecy it was the word that God has spoken through the mouth of a prophet which is the word of God let's keep walking let's go to Isaiah chapter 9 verses 2 to 7 the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them had the light shine thou Hast multiplied the nation and not increased the joy they Joy before thee according to the joy and harvest as me and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil for thou has broken the Yoke of his burden staff of shoulder the rod of his oppressor as in the day of the Midian now keep walking with us chap verse five just just pay attention real closely for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in blood but there shall be with burning and fuel of Fire now look at the words that Isaiah is not prophesying here six For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father ET the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establishment to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth forever ever even [Music] forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this I'm going to read that one more time the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this so you see whose hand whose hand is in on in and on it's God himself it's his plan he's the one doing that amen amen God bless you you can have your seats Lord we just ask a blessing upon the reading of your word bless one more time tonight in Jesus Christ name amen amen so we're approaching Christmas time excuse me I want to take this off Amen brother Daniel gave me the liberty so we're we're family we're just fellowshipping around the word of God so Isaiah prophesied and now the word of God as the logos is now hoovering upon the world 400 years 400 years it just Hoovers around and waits for this prophecy to be fulfilled and God finds the time come down now listen to what brother brandom says here because the nature of the word was always to take flesh the nature of the word was always to take flesh brother bam says this in 1963 he says the Holy Ghost is the father of Jesus Christ Matthew the 2 chapter 20th verse says it says Mary his mother when she was espoused to Joseph she was found with the child of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the father of Jesus Christ and when the Holy Ghost comes and reveals the word and it makes it live just exact then it's a revelation to you you see it it's unfolded it's promised for the hour Joseph seen that that was Isaiah's prophecy fulfill he said unto us a son is born a child is given He Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father and his kingdom there shall be no end he knew who that would be because he saw the whole thing when the angel of the Lord told him this he said that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost see now that was a great mystery imagine how many people were poking at it imagine all the Theologian all the Pharisees how they would have their own interpretation of what Isaiah n was but they never had the Revelation but they were guessing they didn't know now God himself by the Zeal that he he had he came down and he revealed his word the angel to Mary a revelation of the word that word was revealed to her her womb conceived thing that she believed amen amen that's the word of God at that time it took 400 years this for this logos to fall for Mary to believe so his word could come down amen amen that was a sign that was the sign that was given to Mary so we're moving into a Direction I want you to catch a vision this son was not just an ordinary son so the promise was given this is going to be the counselor his name is going to be wonderful Mighty God Everlasting father this is the son this is the very thing that was prophesied so brother bam says this in 1964 identification we I want to pay attention who this son is what this son does because this is not just a son that the denominational system today lives in a manger and says this is baby Jesus and he died for the whole world oh and praise God where where is the life now is he is he just is 2,000 years old have we left them outside right it's the way of the world what they believe today it's among us but we know that this son is the life tonight amen amen because of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so brother brandham is taking this in a character and let's watch what he says here he says what present character do you have where would you be placed at back in them days put yourself in that picture where would you be placed that back in them days when Jesus was on Earth when the big denominations in Theologian was all against him and all the teach teachers and theologians of that day was against him all the Bible teachers against him against what against the clearcut word of that age it says being made manifest being identified God himself identified his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God the Everlasting father a father it says a virgin shall conceive and bear a son the government shall be as over his shoulders of his kingdom there is no end now listen to this who is this person it says a baby God and then God come becomes a man so this word that was prophesied the mouth of a prophet he had to take flesh because God is a respector of persons Sorry God is a respector of his word not a respector of person and when he speaks something it's coming to path the human mind might not understand it the human mind might not catch what that is but by the revelation of the word now we can take flesh so he says and then becomes a man God becoming a man could you imagine Jehovah crying like a baby could you imagine Jehovah born in a barn can you imagine Jehovah playing like a boy could you imagine a church that's claimed to worship Him crucify him now what side would you be identified on now think about what brother brandham is saying we worship the word the Lord God but then by not being submissive to the word we crucify the word and you're no longer worshiping him you're bound by a Creed you're bound by a denomination B by something that's keeping you cing the very word okay it's the same a word was spoken God was now manifesting it could you imagine a church that's claimed to worship Him crucify him what side would you be identified on it says what the true cut clean cut word was was saying itself or or says or would you have two took your Creed your present character where would you be at now that's it says now that's right where you have been seen you have been been it says wherever you are right now that's what you've been back there that's exactly the clearly cut so brother brother vam is identifying the very word and now is is given that that it would take flesh it' be it'd be clear and cut it will not be influenced by so and so it will not be influenced by so and so but they'll stay with the word because they were made that way you can't make you can't make a goat a sheep you can't make a dog a sheep they're amongst USS cheap clothing could devour think about it it's here and God wants a clearcut word he doesn't want us to waver take one side side the other believe Genesis and and and and and and not believe Revelation or or maybe not even believe the Testament whatever the excuse may be so we know the word of God has is an has an inheritance if it's spoken it has to take flesh and somebody there's a lot of ways that the word of God takes flesh remember there's a bride and she has a word that's prophesied over her and it's that word that actually takes her into the condition she needs to be but then there's this other side which are being disobedient which are always stepping on the word of God and they also have a promise and the Bible talks about them too so it's because the word of God already knows based upon his sovereignty the choice says he's they're going to make what word applies to them okay let's turn to Isaiah 11 we're just walking through scriptures this is nothing new this is something that the prophet teaches we're just enjoying the word of God let's turn to Isaiah 11 now this is all scripture being fulfilled this is all scripture being fulfilled in the sun verse 1 through five and there shall come forth a rout out of the stem of Jessie and a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of fear of the Lord and shall make him a quick understanding in the fear of the Lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears but with righteousness shall he judge the poor prove with equity for the meek of the Earth and he shall Smite the Earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked I'm sorry that sounds overcoming this is overcoming and righteousness shall be the girdle of his Lo and and and faithfulness the G of his rain amen but the right he came verse four with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall Smite the Earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the Wicked the word of God does let's go down to verses 10 to 13 we're walking towards the direction I want you to see the I want you to see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he never changes he's the same so if he did it one way with his word for him to be just lie he has to do the same thing so we have to keep him at his word this the word of God Amen verse 10 and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for INS sign of the people it says to it the Gentiles shall seek and his rest shall be glorious and it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his his right hand his right uh his hand again on the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria and from Egypt and from patrus and from Kush and from Elam and from Shar and from Hamad and from from the islands of the sea and he shall set up an insight for the Nations and shall assemble the outcast of Israel and gather and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the Earth the Envy of Ephraim shall depart and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off shall not envy Judah Judah shall not Vex ephra so the word of God is a seed and he possesses inheritance as we were just reading the word of God is poken there a group of people that have been predestinated to catch that to catch the word seed to believe upon it and to come into the very image of that word was to produce the word was given about Jesus that that a virgin shall conceive I'm sure people were thinking that was going to be impossible it never been has never been done in the whole creation of the world how can somebody become impregnated without a relation impossible how can we have a transformation of our body how is it that we could have a Rapture something that our minds cannot understand but a word has been spoken his expression has already been said and now there's a bride and this bride catches the seed of the word and she manifestes that very word because it for her it was only for her it was for nobody else but for her so when the angel came to her she believed them upon his word that's where the word of God does the prophecy was given it took that long for that word to become flesh 50 60 100 200 300 nothing happened 400 people were already becoming religious true I mean they might have read the word of God they might have read the message of the hour but they were just religious they were doing things because they were told to motivating them to do what was given to them to do because God is love am and God is love because of this promise that's why God is love he promised the son the first one fell the second the second one came to redeem us and he says I'm not trusting nobody else coming down I coming down in the Sun and this is not just for for me but this is also for the ones that are inside of me because the same spirit that he had he gave to his bride the Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary God that created himself life inside of Mary it was God that created himself into part of the Bride of who she is this is not no man's work there's no man involved in this this is not God and God is a spirit and they that worship Him worship Him in spirit and in truth he's a spirit amen Amen brother bam says this adoption I want you to catch the vision of the word this is sunship this is sunship he came down to live in a son to find pleasure to live inside of him you know Hebrews 116 says this for it is impossible to please God without faith God wants to be faithful to you he wants you to to depend and be faithful to him two-way relationship don't expect for him to give you everything and now there's no dedication on your side that's religion that's religion Lord I I I'm sorry can you give me today uh maybe I'm too busy I'm sorry a lot of people pray we have to be real with ourself with ourselves Saints there's a lot of there's a lot of traditions outside there's a lot of lies outside there's a lot of ways of deception outside the way is Big there's a lot of followers but few are there that find a path and it's the one that leads to life and it creates sacrifice that's right it's a daily sacrifice it's a daily death it says now it says but it was it says it was such a great thing in that inheritance how it was an inheritance of the land that no one else but a close kidsman could redeem that inheritance he says now let us drop a little token here that I touched on the other night how many of you has prayed for your loved ones it says all right there you are again your inheritance Paul the old Roman says believed on the Lord Jesus Christ it says and thou and thy house shall be saved if you've got enough faith enough for your own self have enough Faith No matter how Wayward that boy is or that girl is will be saved anyhow God somehow if he has to lay them on their back laying there in the hospital dying be saved God promises The Inheritance and it says and they shall be there said Isaiah as all their offsprings with them they shall not hurt nor destroy in all the Holy Mountain sayth the Lord the protection of the word the inheritance of the word good amen amen hallelujah we're inheritors Saints it's time to play games it's it's time to stop playing games the Lord is really looking for a genuine bride that wants to be word of his word Spirit of spirit of his flesh light of his light he she needs to be the light of this hour before you know it you see all these goats just started getting into the message and you realize it just made things just traditional anymore and there's no more sincerity there's no more sincerity if people were to be sincere with themselves oh my where would we be this day but the pride of a man could always stop a man from seeing the revelation of the word a son was given unto us a son was given now this is an eternal son he's a Kinsman so the very word that now has already been fulfilled by the prophet Isaiah remember you were in it you were already there you might have not been born but you were already there because it was a promised word and and brother brandham draws a a beautiful description on the place where this son was born and he I just listened to this the other night and it was such a blessing for me he he preaches this in Phoenix pH why little Bethlehem and just listen to this this is it says and the name Bethlehem [Music] means now just think about this this word this very promise this very promise that has been just traveling over and over and over now was taking flesh and it was more than just a place listen to this it says the name Bethlehem means the house of God's bread how fitting that is with Jesus it says the bread of eternal life Christ is the bread of life we all believe that don't we feeding Bethlehem there the bread center of the world was the bread Center of eternal life that's why the king had to be born there John 3 6:35 I am the bread of life that come out from from God out of Heaven your fathers did eat man in the wilderness all but this bread if a man eats of this bread he shall live forever then Jesus is the bread of life so the bread of life had to come at Bethlehem he is our bread of life for the journey like Israel God gave Israel bread out of the sky for their Journey at their Journey from the left of Egypt the promised land it says bread nightly rain down from the skies and God gave us the bread of life for our journey come at Bethlehem the it says God's house bread it must be where that name is called Bethlehem the house of God's bread amen amen amen so now it was just more than just a place of him being born this was the bread of life this son was going to be more than just a little baby that was just born that lived in their midst this was God humbling himself that he didn't even have a place to lay his head man and to overcome this world a perfect sacrif a perfect word submissive to the word of God God by his word will found pleasure to live inside of the bread of life amen amen so let's turn to Luke chapter 1 we're walking we're walking into a direction and I want I want you to see what this bread is how this bread came how the word was now fulfilling because we have to see that Jesus Christ is the same yes today today and forever so I'm sure we all know the story I believe from from verses 2 to about 10 the angel comes to zachari he reveals to him that he's going to have a son he was a priest he was doing his duty and the angel came to him Angel Gabriel and gave him a promise and Zachariah believed that promise for six months he didn't tell nobody he held it his wife Elizabeth was pregnant she was already now six months nobody knew about it the word of God coming individually to every believer and think about this because this was at the same time that the very word the very son is coming to fulfillment at the same time they're right behind each other so John the Baptist was prophesied he already took flesh and now here comes the son following him and and they they Elizabeth the Mary were cousins so let's just let's just walk through this beautiful story as we're just walking what sunship means amen verse 10 and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of the in incense and there appeared unto him an angel of the lower standing at the right side of the altar of in and when Zarah saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him you know Saints I was talking to brother Daniel today it's coming to a point where people don't have fear of the word of the Lord anymore of the word because God has a fear like that and look at this it says when Zachariah saw him were troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not Zarah for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John and thou sh have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice of his birth and that was the truth can we testify that about John the Baptist his commission but there came a point where John the Baptist said I must decrease so he can increase you recognize the word on the scene he was a great he he had a great ministry and it says and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall be turned to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom to of the just and make ready a people prepared for the Lord okay so this was the ministry of John the Baptist this was the the ministry of the restoration of the faith again the spirit of Elijah was always a spirit of restoration once the children of God started going astray here comes the spirit of Elijah turning them right back turning them right back and so the ministry of John the Baptist he was to prepare a people for for it says to make ready a people prepared for the Lord and Zachariah said unto the angel whereby shall I know this here here he is just like Abraham Saints he was an old priest he was stricken in age he he you know his his health might have been probably not so good in age here comes another promise now let me ask you this Zacharias knew the story of Abraham he was a priest he knew who the faith of his father was so he had in his heart that if he did it with Abraham which was the word yesterday he can do it today too because it was by a divine revelation an angel came down and gave him a promise and he knew amen he knew it says for I am an old man and my wife was stricken in years and the angel answering said unto him I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God and I am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these Glad Tidings and behold Thou shalt be dumb and not be able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season my and the people waited for Zacharias and marveled that he carried so long in the temple and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had not he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless and remain speechless so you see now the word came to Zachariah the prophet was now being fulfilled in Zacharias and his wife the word was now taken flesh was bringing the spirit of restoration it was now bringing the the preparation the the the the the to make her ready to restore her faith so that way when he's on the scene Ministry was to start would already be prepared because now she was the word of God she knew the truth she knew him by his attributes knew him by who he was amen amen he was revealing to her verse 23 and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his Min ministration were accomplished he departed to his own house and after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived and H hid herself five months saying thus had the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth here comes the ministry of Jesus here's the introduction now of this son being born so now the spirit of restoration came the prophecy took flesh it was in the process of manif estation it had to obey every footstep it had to follow every word it had to manifest what he was from and here comes the ministry of Jesus and he departed to his own house okay verse 24 and after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived I'm sorry here we go thus 26 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her said hail thou are highly favored the Lord is with youe blessed are thou among women I want to tell you tonight that thou are heartly favored bride don't ever let go of the position and who you are you are the very thing he came for you are his very life that he identified with identify with the word of God that was highly favored and the Lord is with thee blessed are thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what matter of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her if Fe not married for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord shall give unto him the Throne of his father David confirming scripture and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel now imagine at all these sayings it troubled Mary she probably didn't understand it it was probably too much for her she was probably trying to understand oh what's going on how is this going to come to pass how is this word going to be fulfilled inside of me how am I going to go to this body change how am I going to be able to overcome all these all these things around me how am I going I ever come out of the condition that I'm in but she had the right attitude and she said it says verse 34 then said Mary unto the angel thou shal thou thou how sh this be saying that I have seen no man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also the holy thing which shall be born of the shall be called The Son of God and behold that cousin Elizabeth she had also conceived the son in her old age so look he's making the Revelation to her of what just happened six months ago that nobody knew this was between Zachariah and Elizabeth but the angel revealed to her what was coming amen amen she had also conceived the son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Barren for it for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord look at her attitude be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her amen she was given a promise the word of God revealed to her what was coming now she knew and she was going now back to to to her cousin Elizabeth and she already knew now remember this was with the purpose this was with a purpose and look at the power of the word because if you follow the story all the way through as soon as this promise now was coming upon Mary as soon as the son now was going to come into the image that he was needing to come under God was confirming it bringing it to pass so she now goes to her cousin Elizabeth and she starts testifying and starts saying the angel visited me and I should tell you oh the son of God's coming his name's going to be Emmanuel you see maybe like I was saying in Isaiah be that I see no man God's bringing his promise to pass and I said let Let It Be according to the um and and and I said let it be let it be unto me according to Thy word and his name Shall be Called Jesus now remember when that name was called John the Baptist started moving he was baptized with the Holy Ghost life gave inside of him because that's what the prophecy was that from his mother's womb he shall already have the Holy go so it took the it took the name of Jesus it took the name of the son that was coming to be able to to be able to fulfill the promise to John the Baptist he can fulfill the word of the hour think about that every every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ amen Jesus Christ is the word he's the same yesterday today and forever there's no other way so now this word was coming in fulfillment every day that word had to believe that that was its manifestation could you imagine like the could you imagine like the prophet was reading earlier Jehovah God as a child scraping his knee Jehovah God like a man being hungry he knew what it was like to be bound by the by the things of this world but he overcome them because he was a he was a full son the fullness of God was already in him he was the one that was overcoming amen amen now remember this as all this was happening you the Bride of Jesus Christ in the same promise that's why it's a finished work you were already in that promise it might have been happening 2,000 years ago but we were already in that promise we're just waiting for our hour so we can fulfill the word we be obedient to the word of God we be that sunship that he wants us to [Music] be amen that's what Mary did she believed the Lord now could you imagine imagine how many people were were were looking down on [Music] her imagine imagine this baby boy running around going into the temple coming into a church service and all of a sudden they like yeah that's that son man he was the one that was born of the Virgin imagine the attitude of the people they were so religious that the act that God decided to come in they miss that that was the very thing that happened in the beginning they were so ound by the laws and so traditionalized that they missed him the simple word come in the past the small things of God for the elect are very important because she walks by the word of God she does nothing until she has the sayth the Lord now she can have that individual that's individual because the word of God is personal he reveals to you personally we can be here preaching the gospel for hours we can to 1 2 3:00 in the morning if there's not something inside of you like a connection like a receiver that will be able to connect to God and receive the life of the revelated word it does Nothing To Us Saint it has to be revealed it has to be shown and once that word takes flesh now we manifest it amen The First Time The Name of Jesus was used life took place life took place I want to read some quotes I I hope I hope I hope this is a blessing for you tonight this is just the ABC Saints this is what I love I love I love the pure gospel if I want if I want to Fellowship on something I wanted to be the pure gospel it's already here for us all we have to do is look in between the lines we have to look in between the lines because there's a relationship once we look between the lines we understand God now we can now we can understand what God is expecting of us and I want to do all that God has planned for me to do if it's for me to be a doorm that's what I want to be because I find pleasure being that door what God created me to be [Music] amen so this sunship unto us a son was given son Eternal son and you were there remember that six months before brother Braham says this here 19 59 we're just going to walk through a few paragraphs of brother Bram just describing a six months before that he met Zacharias the priest at the temple and he was an aged man and had read the scriptures and he had taught the scriptures and because he was an old and his wife was Barren the angel the same Ang told him I love that because brother brandham here sometimes speaks in that Dimension right he says the angel and then he says the same Angel this is the same Angel he recognizes told him that after the days of his ministration at the altar waving the incense over the people's prayers that when he went home his wife would conceive and bear child and that preacher questioned the angel how can it be I'm old and my wife is old he had plenty of examples in the Bible there had been Hannah at now think about this because the word word of God is the same he had a testimony he already had a word that was already accomplished so here he is he says there had been Hannah at the temple they had Samuel the prophet after was old and there had been Sarah brought for Isaac after she was nearly a hundred years old and here this little woman had had to believe something that had never happened a woman having a baby without knowing any man she said how shall these things be my Lord he said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee and the holy ghost thing that will be born from you will be called The Son of God it says watch her she didn't question that she said behold the handmaids of the Lord be unto me according to Thy word if we can just do that you see that's the only thing that's what God loves that's the only way to get right with God to take him at his word the only way that there is to please God is to take his word don't trust your knowledge your reason how can it be done cannot be done when you reason then you lose the victory we must cast down all reasoning and believe what God has said to be the truth Mary took him at his word and he changed changed the whole course of her natural life amen Mary took him at his word and he changed the whole nature of her life and he will change the course of our life tonight if you just take him at his word says if you're sin get straighten with it says get straighten that crooked life out of yours if you're vile and immoral he will make you as pure as a lily if you just take him at his word it says the bi conscience that of sin that makes you look at immoral things and use the name of the Lord in vain have temper enough to fight above sa he will change the course of life for you and make you a new creature in his son Jesus Christ by just taking him as his word amen amen it says if you have cancer tonight he will change that and give you health if you have tubercules or sickness where the doctors cannot help you he will change that for you if you'll just take him at his word is word and I am the Lord thy God that heals all thy disease it says how glorious and marvelous our lord Jesus is now as soon as the angel told her about her cousin and she accepted the Lord the Lord's will to be done the only thing she know would happen listen to this that the Holy Spirit was going to do it she depended the word of God the Holy Spirit was going to do it the Zeal of God because he came god with us so God above us God With Us God in us this is what the prophet says above us God With Us and God in us the Holy Spirit was going to do it oh if we can get that settled in our hearts how can a cancer be cured when the doctors give it up it's not to me to try to figure it out it takes the word of the Holy Spirit he was the one who made the promise he's the one who confirms that promise he's obligated to keep that promise and I want you to notice another thing about Mary she did not wait till she was positive she didn't wait till she felt life or physical sign that she was going to have the baby before she said anything about it she just took it God's word was good enough for her and she started rejoicing right away the angel came gave her the promise she accepted the promise she said let it be to me according to thy will from moment on she was obedient to the word of God nothing would take her out of the way she stayed with the word of God Amen and she started rejoicing right away 1962 the spoken word is the original SE so I want you to catch this you see how beautiful the word is he's always been the same yesterday today and it's simple but people sometimes just complicate it it they they take it out of context they start they start messing with that and and and just put their own thoughts in it but the word of God is simple the word of God is simple take him at his word if he said it he will do it because he has an infallible record he never failed he's always accomplished his word spoken word is the Original Seed it says the first son was the is a spoken seed words of God the first son was a spoken seed word of God he was given a bride I'm just reviewing the spirit and I and I was just picking that up here as I said it says a bride to produce himself see that's what the bride was given to produce himself again another Son of God but she fell by hybriding produced himself but she fell she caused him to die okay so we're walking together you understand what the prophet saying here oh amen amen the Second Son a spoken seed word of God was given a bride like Adam before he could marry her she had fallen also for she was put to a free moral agency like Adam's wife was to believe God's word and live or she doubted and die and she and and she did now listen to this then from a little group of a true seed of of the word of God it says God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word it says and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that he has promised for his word in the virgin who knows no manmade Creeds of dogmas it says the Word of Promise in her in himself as it was in Mary God made himself God himself made manifest he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill that all that has been written of him amen we catch that amen it says and as he did when she when he came from the Virgin womb type of the spirit womb now so will the Virgin now accepting his word be it unto me as thou Hast said though it was said by an Angel it was written word Isaiah 96 they will love him and will his potentials and he is their head and they are his subject subjects to his head headship of Christ was his now notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything anything until he has seen the father show him first Harmony between God and Christ John 519 so will the bride that he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it and she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted of the water will raise it up again now think about that because the seed of God is the word of God and if you are the word of God you will receive nothing but the word of God that's why it's important to stay in the word of God if you're in the word of God you start identifying with the truth and your life starts changing and all of a sudden you don't you no longer have hatred you no longer have bitterness you no longer have all these ways that that may be able to climb on you but you live in another dimension and by prayer and supplication and by the watering of the word of God grow remember the the the the the rain falls on the just and the unjust and it's very important that we are the word of God we stay balanced in the word of God amen amen I want to be the one that says Lord let it be unto me as you as your word says I'm not going to question I'm not going to question it it doesn't matter what people say about about it I'm going to believe your word and if it's impossible to my eyes to see it it doesn't matter I'm going to believe it because as I'm walking with you every day as your word now starts impregnating my heart I now start maturing into this sunship and I asked I start getting to know you so I can find the life that you predestin me for me to have this is the this is the point of sunship for you to come to your identity not this fleshly identity of Cosman the identity that he had of you in the beginning of his mind and the only way that you could come to that sunship is to accept the sunship that's right the only way to come into that that sunship is to accept the sunship and there's only one sunship and that's the Lord Jesus Christ a lot of times we like to take things out of context John the Baptist had a great ministry John the Baptist had a had a Ministry of restoration his word was accomplished but then Jesus came upon the scene the word of God came into the into the into the world and he recognized the word of God amongst them he was sitting in prison he was doubting himself a little bit go ask him is this truly he is this really him my but then he came to the Revelation that it was and then he had to go off the S and when he went off the S now Jes was one on the S butam says that there's only there could only be one Prophet on in in in in an age at one time so now one has to decrease so that way Christ can come and the fullness of the bod of the godhead bodily dwell in this flesh to be such a living vessel to be able to live a life submissive to the word of God and the Bible says that he learned obedience by the things he suffered that's true he learned obedience by the things he suffered perect son Saints this is who we are we might have been born in the manger we might have been born in the Kingdom but that doesn't matter what matters is your identity not the identity of this flesh but the identity of what God had predestinated into your spirit that's the way he deals with the IND idual came an Elijah Ministry in our day and by the restoration of the word William brandham introduced Christ and he showed truly what a life of Christ was he came to the Statue of a perfect man he came to the stature of a perfect where now the sunship was restored the restoration of the word now was restored into man of the son of man now where now a son of man the son of man able to bring more sons of man after him because this is God he has a bride and this bride would be bone of his bone and fles of just like the prophet said clear cut word you know a diamond doesn't have its beauty until it's cut you have to cut it it's got to be chopped off for it to bring the light when the light's upon it and now you can see through the diamond but it has to be chopped it has to be a master piece it has it has to be dressed into the character of the word it has to be submissive to the word of God it has to live a life according to the word of God it has to be obedient in love it has to put itself down and choose Christ every day this is the sunship that has been restored to us Malachi 45 Revelations 107 we have an open book The restoration of a son now has been restored and Saints I'm telling you right now time is close time is close and when God is coming through Jesus Christ to redeem his bride he's only taken those with oil in their lamp unless you're mature Eagle to fly in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and have the life of Jesus Christ inside of you that magnet will never pull back to that magnet if the magnet is not in uh uniting right now if the restoration is not happening right now if the union is not happening right now when we when we when we meet him in the clouds we have to be careful because we have to manifest him right now a son is a son always when he comes to a mat church when we when we when we when we grow we put away childish things Corinthians says so now we grow into a maturity now we understand the word of God unto us a son was given and this was the promised word of God and in this promised word of God we the bride of Jesus Christ was in the same word of God that has been fulfilled but remember he comes by the Holy Ghost inside of you and he'll lead you he'll guide you into all truth and righteousness amen amen this son is more than just a baby he's a savior he's a Healer he's a deliverer he's life he's peace he's Everlasting Mighty God he's wonderful Almighty father he the Alp he's the Omega he's the beginning he's the end he's the star of death David he's all of it because he always was and so were you because you are part of that same body never underestimate your identity if the devil's trying to fight anything he will always come at your identity you're not worthy enough you're not worthy enough you don't even have the right to ask God that's the Devil he's an accuser he always comes in accuse you of doing something but you know what there is there's a Bible there's a word of God and the word of God life of God that has been shed for me on Calvary and now by the name of Jesus Christ we can live a life in love and have a relationship and express the image of the word of God in this generation not by a Creed or Not by a creat or a Dogma not just by me saying I'm a message believer I have to live the life of Jesus Christ every day of my life because to live is gain sorry to to live is to die we have to die to ourselves so we can live truly the life that he wanted us to live because from the beginning that's what happened to life it had to die it had to die this flesh had to die so that with the true life the true identity the one that was given in the beginning could come to shine amen amen let's stand I want to read this in closing he says nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again it says here's the secret now when brother brandom says this I cling to it because it rings in my heart I identify with this it says the word it says here's the secret paragraph 3 355 it says the the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word so the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she does it in his name she has th sayth the Lord then it is gered and so the Holy Spirit Waters it let us grown and it serves its purpose they only do his will amen amen no one can persuade them different they have sayth the Lord or they keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complet in in his day it says all things when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not yet time amen amen but the bride now has amen amen by receiving the sunship the son unto us a son is given one fell in the beginning and brought death into the life right he was a living soul and the second one came and that one was a quickening spirit he was the very restoration of life back into the individual because by him we have life and we have life more abundantly so this is what Christmas meant to me I know sometimes you know we we we try to you know I'm I'm I'm Romanian

a spoken word that a virgin would conceive and this this son would be the very bread of God so the so this this son had to be born in the house of God's bread Bethlehem we are now highly Fai faed because of this son that now lives in us not not favored among all the churches but highly favored of the bridegroom highly favor of our husband who is the son just like Mary it said in Luke 145 and

your life count on it you take that to the bank the prophet said he says you know the Pentecostals he he was making a a proverb a metaphor they got a lot of money in the bank they don't know how to sign the check and the Baptist they've learned how to sign the check but they haven't got any money in the bank but to the Bride of Jesus Christ she's got money in the bank know how to sign the check she knows how to ask of God and she knows how to wait until she doesn't wait if no she waits until she knows it'll come to pass like marrying you Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word and she wasn't feeling anything yet no sensation of any [Music] kind the angel Gabel appeared to her she was scared but he told her fear not I've come from the presence of God and I've got a message to her an angel messenger and the first thing he said don't fear fear not because God has got a plan for your life God has a hope for the Hopeless God has salvation for the lost for the sick hope for you more than a hope sayith the Lord the original spoken in Revelations 12 it's speaks of this little lady who had had a relationship with this son a husband Revelations 12 said and there appeared a great Wonder in [Music] heaven a woman clothed with a [Music] sun a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars and she being with child cried travailing in

child cried travailing in birth and pained to be [Music] delivered it was minutes before [Music] midnight and this woman was about to take a Rapture verse five says and she brought forth a Manchild who was to rule all the nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God and to his [Music] throne this is the Bride of Jesus Christ beginning at the first coming of Christ beginning at the day of Pentecost but now she's ready to be [Music] delivered now she's the same woman in l seven remnants of one bride of Jesus Christ in verse 17 of Revelation 12 it said and the dragon was wroth with this woman bride of Christ the Lamb's wife he's coming to destroy her this is the Pale Horse Rider [Music] death the dragon was wroth with the woman so what did he do and went to make war with who with the REM what happened to the woman in the comma the woman was raptured virgin that was left was the remnant on Earth the foolish virgin and God gave you a promise I'll be with you you to the ends of the Earth and when you have need of it bring forth the final change and the Trump of God shall sound and the dead in Christ will rise and when the dragon comes after this little bride she's gone and he goes after the remnant of her SE oh let's be part of that woman that's quickened changed by the power of the holy spirit thank you brother [Music] Cosman for the word of God that brings so
