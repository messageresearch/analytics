TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] as I try now to bend a tale of how I got the victory one day instead of feeling cheery I'd been acting rather dreary and life just wasn't going my way then I happened on an ocean that started me in motion cause that's not how life has to be when it's hard to counting all those blessed and started Mountain that Jesus had been doing for me it's a good day to praise my Jesus a good day to pray it's a good day to open my bible and read what my Jesus had to say it's a good day to serve him and to serve my fellow man it's ending even better than as good as it began it's a good day to praise my Jesus it's a glorious day I was walking down the street when I happened to meet a dear old friend of mine he asked me how my day was and I started in complaining cause I figured he had plenty of time then conviction started setting in because I knew it hadn't been as bad as I'd started to say and if my day was true to tell it was going really well thanks to Jesus so I told him this way it's a good day praise my Jesus a good day to pray it's a good day open my bible and read what my Jesus had to say it's a good day to serve a man to serve my fellow man it's ending even better than as good as it began it's a good day to praise my Jesus it's a glorious day when your Muse about your troubles because you think you've got it bad then you meet someone who's getting it worse don't just hit commiserating about how bad you both have got it but instead pull out this bright little verse cause by testifying of things you know a right and true you'll see how you encourage him as well as he encourages you do your best to lift each other it's a proper thing to do cause it's a glorious day it's a good day praise my Jesus a good day to pray it's a good day to open my bible and read what my Jesus had to say it's a good day to serve him and to serve my fellow man it's ending even better than as good as it began it's a good day praise my Jesus it's a glorious day well now listen sister brother tell your father and your mother how your attitude's been altered this way cause you've given up on fretting and of all those problems patented because it paid no benefits anyway if you really want to make a difference in your life then pursue the things that matter live above the toil and strife it will help all those around you live a richer joyous life cause it's a glorious day it's a good day praise my Jesus a good day to pray it's a good day who opened my Bible and read what my Jesus had to say it's a good day to serve him and to serve my fellow man it's ending even better than as good as it began it's a good day to praise my Jesus it's a glorious day it's a good day to praise my Jesus it's a glorious day [Music]
