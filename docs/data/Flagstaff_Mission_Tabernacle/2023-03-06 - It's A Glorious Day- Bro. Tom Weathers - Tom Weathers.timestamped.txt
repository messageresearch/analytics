[0:09] as I try now to bend a tale of how I got
[0:13] the victory one day
[0:16] instead of feeling cheery I'd been
[0:19] acting rather dreary and life just
[0:22] wasn't going my way
[0:25] then I happened on an ocean that started
[0:28] me in motion cause that's not how life
[0:32] has to be
[0:34] when it's hard to counting all those
[0:37] blessed and started Mountain that Jesus
[0:39] had been doing for me
[0:42] it's a good day to praise my Jesus a
[0:48] good day to pray
[0:51] it's a good day to open my bible and
[0:57] read what my Jesus had to say
[1:00] it's a good day to serve him and to
[1:03] serve my fellow man
[1:05] it's ending even better than as good as
[1:08] it began it's a good day to praise my
[1:13] Jesus it's a glorious day
[1:18] I was walking down the street when I
[1:22] happened to meet a dear old friend of
[1:26] mine
[1:27] he asked me how my day was and I started
[1:30] in complaining cause I figured he had
[1:33] plenty of time
[1:36] then conviction started setting in
[1:39] because I knew it hadn't been as bad as
[1:42] I'd started to say
[1:45] and if my day was true to tell it was
[1:48] going really well thanks to Jesus so I
[1:51] told him this way
[1:54] it's a good day
[1:56] praise my Jesus a good day to pray
[2:02] it's a good day
[2:05] open my bible and read what my Jesus had
[2:10] to say
[2:11] it's a good day to serve a man to serve
[2:15] my fellow man it's ending even better
[2:18] than as good as it began it's a good day
[2:22] to praise my Jesus it's a glorious day
[2:29] when your Muse about your troubles
[2:32] because you think you've got it bad then
[2:34] you meet someone who's getting it worse
[2:38] don't just hit commiserating about how
[2:41] bad you both have got it but instead
[2:44] pull out this bright little verse
[2:47] cause by testifying of things you know a
[2:51] right and true you'll see how you
[2:53] encourage him as well as he encourages
[2:56] you do your best to lift each other it's
[2:59] a proper thing to do cause it's a
[3:03] glorious day

[3:26] serve my fellow man

[3:30] it began it's a good day

[3:43] father and your mother how your
[3:46] attitude's been altered this way
