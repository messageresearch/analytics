[16:20] truth and to glorify your name and to
[16:23] praise you as the song says, Lord. So
[16:25] would you be with us this evening,
[16:26] Father? Would you speak to us through
[16:28] your word, Lord? Would you open that
[16:32] word to us and reveal not ourselves,
[16:35] Lord, but yourself to us even more? We
[16:38] know you're inside of us, Lord. You're
[16:40] dwelling in us and all around us. and we

[17:57] at it. I'm sure brother Steve have has.
[17:59] But Caitlyn uh sent to me the little uh
[18:03] deal they made for the Christmas program
[18:05] of last year.
[18:08] And uh she said what was amazing
[18:11] is how much change happened in a year

[18:30] it was uh I don't know what tomorrow
[18:32] holds. So I'm gonna do everything I can
[18:35] today. And that's one thing I know about
[18:37] my dad. Just that you all know he does
[18:40] not have any regrets from day to day. He
[18:44] did his best. He's doing his best today.
[18:47] And that's the best thing. I come to the
[18:49] garden alone while the de is still on
[18:52] the roses. Amen.
[18:54] I come to the garden
[18:59] alone
[19:03] while the D
[19:06] is still on the road
[19:12] and the voice
[19:15] I hear falling on.
[19:19] I
[19:22] the son
[19:24] of God
[19:26] is
[19:36] with me. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[19:52] In the joy
[19:55] we share
[19:57] as we
[20:07] know
[20:14] the sound of
[20:18] Heat. Heat.
[20:29] Oh man
[20:36] to me
[20:38] within
[20:40] my heart
[20:42] is free.
[20:48] And
[20:49] he was with me and he
[20:56] with me.
[21:00] Tell me
[21:08] the joy
[21:10] we share.

[21:49] Oh,

[22:04] he walks with me. And he talks
[22:11] with me.
[22:14] And he tells me I am his
[22:22] and the joy
[22:25] we share
[22:27] as we dare
[22:29] be there
[22:34] as ever.
[22:41] Amen. Amen. And amen. Number 670 uh 675.
[22:48] And to give a testimony of that song
[22:50] I've written down at the top here. Um
[22:53] and it goes right along with the songs
[22:54] that I didn't even know it. But brother
[22:56] Brennham says the first thing that Cain
[22:58] did wrong
[23:00] was he went out from the presence of
[23:02] God.
[23:04] I didn't even I wrote it at the top here
[23:06] and then I wrote down in the garden. So
[23:08] maybe it's just confirmation for me.
[23:10] Whatever I do, do not go out from the
[23:12] presence of God because that's where you
[23:14] get in trouble. 675. Amen. Mercy there
[23:17] was great and grace was free. Amen.
[23:21] Amen. Wonderful. Thank you, Lord. I I
[23:25] love how he just
[23:27] Oh, thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[23:32] whole infinity
[23:36] and pride.
[23:38] Sharing
[23:40] my Lord was to
[23:44] knowing I was
[23:47] Yeah. Heat.
[23:58] Heat. Heat.
[24:10] Heat. Heat.
[24:21] Heat.
[24:23] Heat.
[24:33] Heat. Heat.
[24:50] Heat.
[24:52] Heat.
[25:07] Heat.
[25:09] Heat.
[25:19] Yeah.
[25:23] Heat.
[25:39] Oh,
[25:58] heat,
[26:00] heat.
[26:12] Amen.
[26:14] Yes.
[26:16] Amen. Amen. You know what? I cut myself
[26:19] off and I knew I shouldn't have. We're
[26:20] going to sing that same verse that this
[26:24] the number five. Oh yes, that's the one.
[26:27] Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan.
[26:30] Amen. And every time I read the
[26:32] scripture in the morning, every time I
[26:34] think about him during the day, I can't
[26:37] help but think of this great plan that
[26:39] he did. What a mighty golf. I wish I had
[26:42] words like this. I can't pin them, but I
[26:45] can sing them. Amen. Amen. Oh, the love
[26:49] that drew salvation.
[26:51] Oh, the love that drew salvation.
[26:57] Heat. Heat.
[27:07] Yeah. Heat.
[27:19] Are we taking
[27:25] all
[27:26] my words
[27:30] at
[27:36] a brother
[27:39] for tonight?
[27:43] You bless these tongues, Lord. In your
[27:46] beautiful name we pray. Amen.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Every day with Jesus is sweeter than the
[27:54] day before. Sister Pauline, you put up
[27:57] some uh announcements that I forgot to
[27:59] make on Sunday. Can we have those again?
[28:02] Thank you if that's possible. Thank you
[28:04] so much for that. Amen. Every day with
[28:07] Jesus. Amen. And want to make mention
[28:10] brother Castile will be coming Lord
[28:12] willing on December 21st the children's
[28:15] program and lunch provided in the
[28:17] fellowship hall also on that 21st.
[28:19] Wednesday the 31st wash night service uh
[28:23] will be held at 10:30 p.m. That's
[28:27] Wednesday the 31st. Amen. Every day with
[28:30] Jesus every day with Jesus
[28:35] is sweeter than the day before. Oh
[28:42] Jesus.
[28:43] I love you more and more.
[28:50] He keeps me
[28:53] away.
[28:56] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[29:06] Jesus
[29:13] every day
[29:17] I
[29:23] he
[29:33] is than the day before.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Did any brothers, brother Thomas getting
[29:43] ready? Did anybody have something
[29:45] happened to him today that was just they
[29:47] want the whole body of Christ to know?
[29:51] Did anybody have anything happen to him?
[29:55] Well, then I did. And I don't say this
[29:57] as a joke. I had another breath.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; I really did.
[30:04] I've been to the point where I remember
[30:07] what it's like to to pass out and not
[30:09] even know I did it
[30:11] &gt;&gt; and not even know anything about it. So,
[30:13] I had another breath. And I mean that to
[30:16] goodness.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Besides that, Brother Jerry Paul saw me
[30:19] and he called me and he just made my
[30:22] day. So, amen. Lord bless you all.
[30:43] Note to self, make sure it's plugged in
[30:46] all the way.
[30:49] Yeah,
[30:51] we sang this today at the Peaks. Brother
[30:54] Jim was there. It's good to see Brother
[30:56] Jim. And I just thought, man, I haven't
[31:00] sang this in a long time. Sister
[31:03] Victoria is not here. She's the one who
[31:05] always asked for it. But uh trust this
[31:09] blesses you.
[31:27] It was early in the day and I was sick
[31:31] and feeling ill.
[31:34] Daddy and the kids was all out working
[31:38] in the field.
[31:42] Just then, mama called my name as she
[31:45] stared out the door. Just outside there
[31:49] stood an old man.
[31:52] we had never seen before.
[31:57] He said, "My wife and I are passing
[32:00] through. We'll soon be on our way. If
[32:04] you could only spare some water from the
[32:07] well, we'd gladly pay."
[32:12] And I never will forget how mama warmed
[32:16] them with a smile. And though I knew our
[32:20] stores was empty,
[32:23] she said, "Won't you stay a while?"
[32:28] We didn't have a lot, but what we had
[32:32] we'd freely give. Didn't God give up his
[32:37] only son to die that we might live?
[32:42] When it seems there's none despair,
[32:45] remember there is always just enough to
[32:49] share. Thereby some have entertained
[32:54] angels
[32:56] unawares.
[33:00] Mama offered them some coffee. Then she
[33:03] picked them up a meal.
[33:10] And as I looked at that man, his eyes
[33:14] were blue as steel.
[33:17] And with his sunburn face and snow white
[33:20] hair, he talked about the Lord.
[33:24] And when I looked into his eyes, I
[33:28] realized this man was something more.
[33:34] Now the day was growing late. He said,
[33:38] "It's time for us to go." And they
[33:41] walked out through the gate into a low
[33:45] spot in the road.
[33:48] And we waited and we watched for them to
[33:52] reach the other side. They had vanished
[33:56] suddenly into a holler where there was
[34:01] no place to hide.
[34:05] Mama raised up 13 children in a house so
[34:10] full of love. Even through the Great
[34:13] Depression, seems we always had enough.
[34:19] And when folks would come to call, well,
[34:22] they were never turned away. And we tell
[34:27] them of the old man
[34:30] and the blessings that he gave.
[34:35] We didn't have a lot, but what we had
[34:39] we'd freely give. Didn't Jesus bleed and
[34:44] die upon the cross that we might live?
[34:49] When it seems there's none to spare,
[34:52] remember there is always just enough to
[34:56] share. Thereby some have entertained
[35:00] angels
[35:03] unawares.
[35:05] When it seems there's none to spare,
[35:08] remember there is always just enough to
[35:12] share. Thereby some have entertained
[35:17] angels.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's all stand if you
[35:30] would.
[35:32] Wonderful. Hebrews 13 chap verse two. Be
[35:37] not forgetful to entertain strangers for
[35:39] thereby some have entertained angels
[35:42] &gt;&gt; unaware.
[35:45] Praise the Lord.
[35:47] Good to be in the house of the Lord
[35:48] today. I'm thankful for the Lord. He
[35:52] never fails to give us what we have need
[35:54] of. And I know tonight will be no
[35:57] difference because he's never failed us
[35:59] yet. So, we thank him for that. In the
[36:02] book of Isaiah, chapter 42, if you would
[36:06] turn there with me before we're seated.
[36:08] And I keep telling myself I'm just going
[36:12] to talk to the congregation. I'm not
[36:14] going to get all excited and scream and
[36:15] yell, but sometimes I can't help it. So
[36:18] if I do, just forgive me. It's not my
[36:20] intention this evening or any evening.
[36:23] Um but I'm just a human and I get
[36:25] excited and
[36:27] &gt;&gt; so yes, brother Kurt, praise the Lord.
[36:30] Isaiah 42 in the first verse it says
[36:33] this. Behold my servant whom I uphold,
[36:37] mine elect in whom my soul delightth.
[36:41] I've put my spirit upon him. He shall
[36:44] bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
[36:47] He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause
[36:51] his voice to be heard in the street.
[36:55] Now, I guess you know why I said I'll be
[36:56] quiet this evening. A bruised reed shall
[36:59] he not break, and a smoking flax shall
[37:02] he not quench. He shall bring forth
[37:05] judgment unto truth. And that means
[37:09] truthful judgment. It's not a He brings
[37:12] forth righteous judgment. He judges
[37:14] righteous judgment. The Bible says,
[37:16] "Amen." Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[37:18] Father, Lord, we've read your word and
[37:20] your word is a blessing to us. It will
[37:23] not return void. You teach us that,
[37:26] Lord. We believe that your word goes
[37:27] forth and does not return empty Lord but
[37:30] it brings power and life to our soul and
[37:32] we thank you for that. Feed us this
[37:34] evening once again Lord in Jesus name we
[37:36] pray. Amen. You can be seated and I reg
[37:41] regrettably
[37:42] this is this is one of those scriptures
[37:44] that I've read many many times but have
[37:46] never taken the time to understand what
[37:49] it really means. A bruised reed shall he
[37:55] not break, and the smoking flax shall he
[37:59] not quench. He shall bring forth
[38:01] judgment under truth. What's a bruised
[38:03] reed? And what does it have to do that
[38:07] he won't break it? And what is a smoking
[38:10] flax? We don't even use that term
[38:12] anymore. A flax. Brother Tom, some of
[38:14] the brothers who are studious would
[38:16] probably know what that means. Does
[38:18] anyone know just what a smoking flack
[38:20] flax is? Just anybody? Nobody. So, have
[38:25] you ever seen a candle when it's about
[38:27] to go out, it begins to die down? It
[38:30] begins to smoke. Actually, of course,
[38:31] it's always smoking, but as it dies, it
[38:33] begins to puff out and it's called a
[38:36] smoking wick or a smoking flax. I didn't
[38:39] know it. I had to look it up and I and
[38:42] the Bible says he sees that smoking
[38:45] flack flax but he doesn't put it out and
[38:50] he sees the bruised reed and he doesn't
[38:54] break it.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; And we're talking about the great
[38:57] shepherd. We're not talking about you
[38:59] know just normal human. This is talking
[39:02] about the Lord Jesus Christ really in
[39:04] this scripture. It's actually speaking
[39:06] of him. And later on, uh, the scripture
[39:09] is quoted. Matthew quotes this scripture
[39:11] and says that there's a there's a
[39:13] prophecy that's fulfilled here. But a
[39:15] battered reed or a bruised read, will he
[39:17] not break it? It's it's those of us who
[39:20] are spiritually broken or bruised or
[39:24] hurt or in trouble or in a certain
[39:27] situation and you've been bruised. And
[39:29] the Bible say he's so merciful and he's
[39:31] so gracious to us that in that weakened
[39:34] state that you can find yourself in
[39:36] sometimes he's not going to break you
[39:37] down anymore. And as you begin to smoke
[39:40] and and and the flax it might feel like
[39:42] it's dying out instead of killing it.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; He actually revives it again. He doesn't
[39:50] he doesn't he doesn't smoke when we're
[39:52] almost dying. you know, he's not the
[39:54] type of of Lord that would see us
[39:56] suffering and and I we we'll say it like
[39:59] this in 1 Corinthians 10. It says,
[40:01] "There's no temp temptation that taken
[40:03] you, but such as is common to man, but
[40:06] God is faithful and will not suffer you
[40:09] to be tempted above that you are able."
[40:12] So, when you get to the point where
[40:13] you're just like, "It's Le Oysia. We're
[40:15] all in, you know, we're all in this
[40:17] together. Maybe I'll just come down here
[40:18] and we'll just talk this evening." So
[40:19] we're all we're all feel like some days
[40:22] we're the smoking flag, you know, we're
[40:24] we're the wick that's just dying out and
[40:26] we barely are holding it together. He
[40:28] doesn't at that point come and put more
[40:30] things on you and and kill you and and
[40:32] snuff you out. But in that point, he he
[40:34] kind of cleans around the edges and
[40:36] makes it free for you can smoke a little
[40:38] more. Now, he might let you get to that
[40:40] point to really see what you're made of.
[40:42] And he might let you get bruised to
[40:44] really see what you're made of, but when
[40:45] you get there, he's not going to then
[40:48] break you down even further. That's not
[40:50] the type of of Lord that we serve. He'll
[40:52] not suffer you to be tempted above that
[40:55] you're able. But with the temptation,
[40:56] what he does is he makes a way of
[40:59] escape. He he actually gives you and and
[41:02] this word in Greek it means an egress or
[41:05] an exit. So, so he he he puts something
[41:08] on you and then he he shows you, listen,
[41:11] that's the way of escape. Now, you can
[41:13] choose not to take the way of escape and
[41:14] and certainly we've all done it many
[41:16] times. But but in every temptation that
[41:19] he gives you and every trial that he
[41:20] gives you and and every addiction or
[41:22] every thing that you struggle with and
[41:24] every sin that you're kind of bound with
[41:26] and you're fighting against with that
[41:28] even with that temptation which is
[41:30] common, you're not getting tempted above
[41:32] anything that God hasn't given you the
[41:34] power to overcome is what that means. So
[41:36] with every temptation he gives you he
[41:38] actually is the way of escape. Brother
[41:40] Brandham says in every temptation he'll
[41:42] make a way of escape. Say, "Mother,
[41:45] don't believe it. Daddy, don't believe
[41:46] it. The church don't believe it." I
[41:47] don't care who don't believe it. If you
[41:50] believe it, God will make a way of
[41:51] escape. Notice that if you believe that
[41:53] there's an exit, God puts the exit
[41:55] there. If you don't believe it, well,
[41:57] then there's no exit for you because you
[41:59] have to believe on the way or the egress
[42:02] or the exit for there to be one. So, he
[42:05] says this, he gave a God will make a way
[42:07] of escape. He gave a sign that he would.
[42:10] They were on their way straight to the
[42:12] promised land where God promised them
[42:13] and the Red Sea shut them off and they
[42:15] got in trouble. They didn't know what to
[42:17] do. God showed that he'd make a way of
[42:20] escape in every temptation, every trial.
[42:24] And he's going to go and list some here.
[42:25] And I kind of like it cuz you might
[42:27] think, well, it's just a temptation. But
[42:28] brother Bam goes on here and says, if
[42:30] you can't get quit smoking, take God one
[42:33] time.
[42:35] Notice that if you can't quit, take God
[42:36] at his word. You quit can't quit lying,
[42:39] can't quit stealing, can't quit having
[42:41] temper. Take God with you one time. If
[42:44] you don't feel like going to church and
[42:45] you can't get anywhere, take God with
[42:47] you once. Take his promise. He proved to
[42:49] the Red Sea that he'll make a way of
[42:51] escape. I mean, there was no way for
[42:53] them. There was the sea in front, the
[42:55] army behind, and there was no way. So,
[42:57] that was a temptation that he put upon
[43:00] and upon Israel. And he said, "Now with
[43:02] the temptation, if you'll believe that I
[43:04] can make a way of escape, I'll make a
[43:06] way of escape." So no temptation, here's
[43:09] another way of wording this, is beyond
[43:11] the resistance that God can help you
[43:14] resist and overcome. So with the
[43:16] temptation, there comes the way of
[43:18] escape with it. I don't know if we had
[43:19] the Greek there, Sister Paulie, if we
[43:21] could pick it up. No, here here's the
[43:22] word. Now, it's only used twice in the
[43:24] New Testament, and it's Greek, and I
[43:26] don't even want to ebasis, maybe
[43:28] something like that. So way of escape,
[43:30] it's the end. It's the egress. It's the
[43:32] way out, the exit, and it's figuratively
[43:35] the way of escape from temptation. So
[43:37] Paul is using this this Greek word and
[43:39] he says, "So within temptation, he gives
[43:42] you also the big exit sign at the back
[43:44] of the room there that I'm looking at.
[43:46] He gives you the temptation is there,
[43:48] but the exit is there too for for you to
[43:50] have a way out." And the only other time
[43:52] this is used in scripture is in Hebrews
[43:55] 13 and:e 7. And it says it like this.
[43:57] Remember them which have the rule over
[44:00] you. I like the Spanish version better.
[44:02] It says, "Remember your pastors who have
[44:05] spoken unto you the word of God whose
[44:07] faith follow considering the end," and
[44:11] that's the word there, the way of escape
[44:13] of their conversation. Now, in English,
[44:15] in old English, when they would use the
[44:17] word conversation, it means conduct or
[44:21] the way of living, the way that you
[44:23] live. And it's beautiful because you can
[44:25] say whatever you want. you know, this is
[44:27] how I say I live, but but actually your
[44:30] true conversation, your life actually
[44:32] speaks or converses the way that you
[44:35] live. So he says, "Now pray for them.
[44:37] They've spoken unto you the word of God
[44:39] whose faith follow. Consider the the
[44:42] exit or the way of escape of their
[44:44] conversation." I put a couple uh other
[44:46] translations up here. Remember those
[44:48] leading you and I think this is the
[44:49] Berean or Yeah, maybe this is the
[44:51] Berean. word of leading you who spoke
[44:53] the word of God to you of whom
[44:55] considering the outcome of their way of
[44:58] life. You are to imitate the faith.
[45:01] Remember those who rule over you have
[45:02] spoken the word of God to you whose
[45:04] faith follow the outcome or the way of
[45:06] escape of their conduct. Now this is
[45:08] Hebrews 137.
[45:12] Do we know what Hebrews 13:8 is?
[45:14] &gt;&gt; So now think this is the scripture right
[45:17] before. So he says maybe and you know
[45:19] it's two different sentences. So, don't
[45:21] you know don't hold me to this too much,
[45:23] but it's like this. Remember those who
[45:24] rule over you. They've spoken the word.
[45:27] Follow their faith and consider the way
[45:29] of escape. Jesus Christ the same
[45:31] yesterday, today, and forever. I I kind
[45:34] of like it like that. Consider a prophet
[45:36] came at this day and he taught us the
[45:38] way and and he showed us see there's a
[45:40] way of escape from Leodysia. And that's
[45:42] none other than the message of the hour.
[45:44] The Holy Ghost dwelling inside of you.
[45:46] Jesus Christ himself, his spirit
[45:49] dwelling inside of you. That's the only
[45:51] way you're going to escape. So consider
[45:53] the one who rules. Now brother B didn't
[45:55] rule over us per se. But in a way he's
[45:58] sort of the pastor of the age or or the
[46:00] prophet of this age to teach us things.
[46:02] So consider the end or the way of escape
[46:05] as he taught it to us. Jesus Christ the
[46:08] same yesterday, today and forever. And I
[46:12] again I say brother Bam said God's
[46:14] provided sacrifice tonight. The way of
[46:16] escape is through Jesus Christ.
[46:20] Then Jesus Christ provided a church for
[46:22] the unbelievers
[46:24] that they could come in and see the
[46:25] manifestation of his resurrection and
[46:27] know beyond a shadow of doubt that he
[46:29] rose from the dead. Jesus rose from the
[46:32] dead. Making a provided way for
[46:35] whosoever will might look and live. But
[46:38] if you refuse to look, how can you do
[46:40] anything but die? Jesus said, "If you
[46:42] don't believe that I am he, you'll die
[46:44] in your sins." So now he said, "Now
[46:46] we'll notice him." What made him
[46:48] different as a speaker? I guess he
[46:49] wasn't so forceful to get out in the
[46:52] street like we do and brother Steve does
[46:54] and scream cuz the Bible said his voice
[46:57] was not heard in the street and a
[47:01] bruised reed and a smoking flax and so
[47:05] forth as the prophet said it would be. A
[47:07] bruised weed he will not break or a
[47:09] smoking flax will he not quench. And we
[47:12] know that he would never turn away a
[47:15] bruised reed. He would mend it.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; And I pray, Brother Bam says, "Heavenly
[47:21] Father," I like how he words that if
[47:23] there be any spirits that's broken or
[47:26] discouraged
[47:28] spirits
[47:29] &gt;&gt; or feeble, hands hanging down and knees
[47:32] bagged, that may they be lifted up
[47:34] tonight, Lord. May the Holy Spirit come
[47:37] and heal our hearts and spirit and our
[47:40] physical beings. And we'll give him all
[47:42] the praise for it. We ask in Jesus'
[47:44] name. Many time uh you know ministers
[47:46] sometimes are the worst at this. They
[47:49] should take the Lord's example and and
[47:51] realize that the people are broken and
[47:53] they're discouraged and their feeble
[47:55] hands are hanging down and then many
[47:56] times someone would come in and just
[47:58] whip the person even further. But the
[48:00] Lord came in and saw bruised spirits and
[48:02] bruised reads and discouraged hearts and
[48:05] instead of making it worse, he began to
[48:08] encourage them. And I I read something
[48:09] the other day that said like if you want
[48:11] people to to get better at what they do,
[48:14] encourage them in what they're doing and
[48:17] they'll actually perform better than you
[48:19] could even think. If you just said,
[48:20] "Hey, you could do this better or that
[48:22] better." If you just say, "Hey, you're
[48:23] doing this really good and that really
[48:25] good." You know, they'll start to get
[48:27] better at the other things that they do.
[48:29] And that's not just psychology, but the
[48:31] Lord Jesus Christ did the same thing.
[48:33] When someone has a mistake or an error
[48:35] or something, he beca he came in. He
[48:38] began to mend that thing and he and he
[48:39] didn't break it when it was smoking and
[48:41] and almost done. He came in and he dug
[48:43] around it a little bit so that the fire
[48:46] that had been broken and and but was
[48:47] beginning to smoke would begin to to
[48:49] really uh spring up again and be a fire
[48:52] of eternal life. Praise the Lord. The
[48:55] great shepherd does not rule by force or
[48:57] forcefulness.
[49:00] My
[49:02] Ezekiel chapter 1. I began to read this
[49:04] the other day. It's good to read if
[49:05] you're a pastor, you know, Jeremiah 23
[49:07] and Ezekiel 34 to really keep you in
[49:10] your place. It starts out like this, woe
[49:13] to the shepherds.
[49:15] So that just really keep you. And the
[49:17] word of the Lord came unto me saying,
[49:19] Ezekiel says, son of man, prophesy
[49:22] against the shepherds of Israel.
[49:24] Prophesy and say unto them, thus sayeth
[49:26] the Lord God unto the shepherds, woe be
[49:28] to the shepherds of Israel that do feed
[49:30] themselves. Should not the shepherds
[49:33] feed the flocks?
[49:36] &gt;&gt; You eat the fat and you clothe you with
[49:38] the wool. You kill them that are fed,
[49:39] but you feed not the flock. The diseased
[49:42] have you not strengthened. The bruised
[49:44] reed and the smoking flax. You you
[49:46] didn't strengthen it. Neither have you
[49:47] healed that which was sick. Neither have
[49:49] you bound up that which was broken.
[49:51] Neither have you brought again that
[49:52] which was driven away. Neither have you
[49:54] sought that which was lost. But with
[49:55] force and with cruelty have you ruled
[49:58] them. And Lord, help me to never even
[50:02] attempt to roll by force. It's not my
[50:04] nature or things like that. It's against
[50:05] my nature. Even what happened on Sunday,
[50:07] it's it's against me and and you know, I
[50:09] repent for some of those things that
[50:11] that that offended people. But but a
[50:14] shepherd should never rule by cruelty
[50:17] and and by force. And when he sees
[50:19] people down, if you go and say, "What's
[50:20] your problem? Why are you down?" You
[50:22] know, you know, you don't realize people
[50:23] are living in Leodysia.
[50:26] And and Paul said it like this. I think
[50:28] I said this on Sunday. You judge them
[50:30] people of of certain things and and then
[50:32] he said you do the same thing and that's
[50:35] uh it's well it's just the truth. Okay.
[50:39] So now in Isaiah 42 he doesn't he says
[50:42] he won't cry or lift up. Verse two, nor
[50:44] cause his voice to be heard in the
[50:45] street a bruised it shall he not break
[50:47] and the smoking flack shall he not
[50:49] quench. He'll shall bring he shall bring
[50:51] forth judgment unto truth. He won't be
[50:55] discouraged till he have brought forth
[50:57] judgment unto truth. But what was the
[51:01] interpretation of this? What did it look
[51:03] like in the real world?
[51:06] Because Matthew says, "And this thing
[51:09] happened because Isaiah the prophet said
[51:12] Isaiah 42 1-6."
[51:15] And Jesus fulfills this prophecy in
[51:17] Matthew 12. And let's read. I think it
[51:20] will kind of help us because it's easy
[51:22] to say, "Well, Jesus healed." But how
[51:24] did he do that?
[51:26] How was it that he didn't bruise the
[51:27] reed or break the reed that was already
[51:29] broken or quench the flax that was
[51:31] smoking? The Bible says at the time at
[51:34] that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day
[51:36] through the corn and his disciples were
[51:39] and hungered and began to plick the ears
[51:41] of corn and to eat. Now, I've quoted
[51:42] this wrong many times and I went and
[51:44] looked up Matthew and it's Mark chapter
[51:46] 2 and Luke chapter 5.
[51:49] I've quoted it that Jesus went and
[51:51] picked corn, but none of them say that.
[51:54] It says that his disciples were hungered
[51:57] and they went and began to pluck the
[51:59] corn. And this thought came to me this
[52:02] afternoon while I was studying on this.
[52:04] Why on Friday, so Sabbath would have
[52:06] been Saturday for the Jews, why on
[52:09] Friday didn't Jesus just tell them, "Hey
[52:12] guys, you're going to be hungry
[52:13] tomorrow. you should pick some extra
[52:15] corn today so you don't have to do it on
[52:18] the Sabbath. Why wouldn't he do that?
[52:21] Why would he uh know I mean certainly he
[52:24] knew they were going to be hungry or had
[52:26] some sort of discernment. Why wouldn't
[52:27] he say it's Friday, you don't want to be
[52:29] picking corn tomorrow.
[52:31] You're going to get into trouble and
[52:34] then not you like why wouldn't he do
[52:36] that?
[52:38] the Mark chapter 2 and Luke 5. It does
[52:40] not record Jesus picking any of the
[52:42] corn, just the disciples.
[52:44] And I thought maybe, and this is there's
[52:46] no, you know, authority on this, so
[52:48] we're presuming, but maybe he wanted to
[52:50] teach us something through the
[52:52] scriptures, allow his disciples to do
[52:55] something to teach the the ones who can
[52:57] be legalists, and I've got a legalist
[52:59] bone in my body, so it's good for me.
[53:01] But ones that can be legalists to maybe
[53:04] see the mercy and the the the mercy and
[53:07] the truth side of this statement. So
[53:10] now, you know, knowing the fallen and
[53:12] the corrupt state of mankind and the pro
[53:14] just let me well I'll tell you what
[53:15] happened in Peru a couple weeks ago. So
[53:17] we got to this um a certain city and
[53:20] it's in the middle of nowhere, not even
[53:22] a city. A couple hundred people and it's
[53:25] in literally 11 hours one direction
[53:28] getting there and 7 hours another
[53:29] direction. And so it's impossible to get
[53:31] there and difficult and a dirt road and
[53:33] and there's a pastor there who began a
[53:36] church about 20 years ago and since then
[53:38] has helped three other missions start.
[53:40] So, there's four churches within, you
[53:42] know, about a 6-hour period. And this
[53:44] pastor started all those. And we have a
[53:46] questions and answer service. And he
[53:48] says to me, he he, you know, a couple
[53:50] questions gets asked and he's kind of
[53:52] being timid. And he says, "Uh, brother
[53:54] Steve, I have a question. Um, and he
[53:56] begins to cry." And he says, "My, you
[53:59] know, the Bible says your house has to
[54:00] be in order for for a bishop. You know,
[54:03] he's got to have his house in order. And
[54:04] I I have a 16-year-old son and he's not
[54:06] serving the Lord.
[54:10] What? What do I do? Do I have to stop
[54:12] preaching?
[54:14] Should I just quit?
[54:17] That's a bruised read.
[54:19] It's a smoking flax.
[54:22] And forgive your pastor if you think he
[54:23] was off the word on this. I said,
[54:25] "Brother, don't you dare stop. There's
[54:28] that church that needs you. There's that
[54:30] church that needs you. There's that
[54:31] church that needs you. And your own
[54:34] church needs you. And there's nobody
[54:35] else in the area. Why would you look at
[54:37] that?" And I and I'll tell you and I
[54:38] don't think brother Jim would remind me
[54:40] or would mind me saying this. a minister
[54:42] came to him one time and was saying that
[54:44] there there was something you know he
[54:45] felt like he wasn't able to minister and
[54:48] and and brother Jim told me he said
[54:50] brother Steve I told that minister I
[54:52] have something in my own life
[54:55] you know like he could have been
[54:56] criticized many times for you know he he
[54:58] wasn't perfect when he was younger and
[55:00] he was a little rougher when he was
[55:01] younger or whatever it might be and he
[55:03] said I the devil fights me on that but
[55:05] it's just to keep me humble and and to
[55:07] keep me dedicated and consecrated and
[55:09] and so I told this Brother, listen,
[55:11] brother. Don't Don't let Satan put that
[55:13] on you. You know what? Pray for your
[55:14] son. Get the church together and pray
[55:16] for that son. And and maybe God would
[55:18] restore that situation. And and yeah,
[55:20] your house is in in a little trouble
[55:22] right now. And and you know, but there's
[55:24] no other option. You know, maybe the
[55:26] disciples were hungry and it was the
[55:27] Sabbath, but but Jesus when he answers,
[55:30] he says it like this. David was hungry
[55:33] and he had no right eating the shoebre.
[55:36] There's no way he could legally go and
[55:38] eat the shoe bread only for the priests.
[55:42] Now Jesus is answering the criticism
[55:44] here. Hey, what are you doing on on
[55:46] Sabbath? Your disciples are picking
[55:48] corn. They weren't even criticizing him.
[55:50] Your disciples are picking corn on the
[55:52] they're they're working on the Sabbath.
[55:54] And Jesus says, don't you remember what
[55:55] David did? Now, this doesn't say, you
[55:58] know, Satan will will will take this and
[56:00] try to get men to compromise on God's
[56:02] word. But you know, you got to have
[56:04] mercy and you got to have truth. And God
[56:06] requires them both. You can't just be
[56:09] one way or the other. He requires that.
[56:12] And so he says, "Listen, don't you know
[56:14] the priests profane the Sabbath?"
[56:18] And they're blameless. Why? How do they
[56:20] profane it? You can't even build a fire
[56:23] if you're Jewish on the Sabbath. They
[56:25] have to offer the sacrifices, build the
[56:28] fire, work there on the Sabbath, kill
[56:31] all the the lambs or the sheep or ox or
[56:33] whatever it might be. They have to work
[56:35] the entire Sabbath. And Jesus called
[56:37] that profaining the Sabbath. And then he
[56:39] said, "They're blameless."
[56:42] And that's not breaking a bruised reed.
[56:47] And so this brother, and again, forgive
[56:48] me if you think I'm on the word on this,
[56:50] but I'm looking at it. Are you serious,
[56:52] brother? Pray. We'll pray right now.
[56:54] We're going to pray for your son and
[56:55] we'll pray that your house will be drawn
[56:57] together so that Satan can have that
[56:58] little dart to shoot at your mind. But
[57:01] in the meantime, you keep doing what
[57:02] you're doing. There's a need here and
[57:04] you're the man for the job.
[57:07] And I asked him, is there anybody else?
[57:08] No, brother. There's nobody else. What?
[57:10] And it seemed maybe obvious to us, but
[57:13] you know how Satan will just attack
[57:15] people for just little things. You know,
[57:17] it really bothered me. Anyways,
[57:20] Jesus says this, "Woe unto you scribes
[57:22] and Pharisees, hypocrites. You paid
[57:25] tithe of mint and annis and cumin and
[57:27] have omitted the weightier matters of
[57:30] the law." So, it's weightier now.
[57:32] Judgment, mercy, and faith. That's
[57:36] weightier. These ought yet have done,
[57:38] and ought not to leave the other undone.
[57:39] You blind guides, you take a a knat has
[57:43] fallen into your water, that unclean
[57:45] gnat, and you make sure he doesn't fall
[57:47] in. So you put a strainer over your cup
[57:49] to make sure the gnat doesn't fall in.
[57:51] So you strain him out. Meanwhile, on
[57:54] your plate, you're eating the very
[57:56] unclean camel. Now, that's 2025 version
[57:59] of what he's saying there.
[58:03] There's weightier matters of the law.
[58:04] And I think we get stuck sometimes on
[58:06] the knat. And but there's something
[58:09] better. It's called mercy and faith and
[58:12] judgment. All right. So when the
[58:13] Pharisees saw it, they said unto him,
[58:15] "Behold, your disciples, do that which
[58:17] is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day."
[58:19] But he said unto them, "Have you not
[58:20] read what David did when he wasn't
[58:23] hungered, and they that were with him,
[58:24] how he entered into the house of God,
[58:26] and did eat the shoe bread, which was
[58:27] not lawful for him to eat, neither for
[58:30] them that were with him, but with him,
[58:32] but only for the priests.
[58:35] How or have you not read in the law? How
[58:37] that on the Sabbath day the priests in
[58:39] the temple profane the Sabbath, but
[58:43] they're blameless.
[58:47] How did they do it? They they ended up
[58:49] But I say unto you that in this place is
[58:53] one greater than the temple. In
[58:55] Flagstaff Tabernacle is one greater than
[58:57] the temple. In your temple is one
[59:00] greater than the very temple. You are a
[59:02] temple of the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[59:04] Ghost greater than the very temple that
[59:07] actually he he's what makes your temple
[59:09] great. In Hosea 6, if you've been
[59:10] reading that, it says, "For I desired
[59:12] mercy and not sacrifice and the
[59:14] knowledge of God more than burnt
[59:17] offerings." And then he says, "But if
[59:19] you had known what this meanth, I will
[59:20] have mercy." So Jesus now quotes Hosea.
[59:23] He just got done quoting what happened
[59:25] to David. And he quotes Hosea and he
[59:27] says, "I will have I desire mercy and
[59:30] not sacrifice and if you had known what
[59:33] it mean, not if you read it
[59:35] intellectually, but if you understood
[59:37] the spirit of what that means." That
[59:40] means when a guy's ox is in a ditch on
[59:42] the Sabbath, go help him get it out.
[59:46] And how much is greater uh uh things
[59:48] than that? He said, "For the Son of Man
[59:51] is Lord even of the Sabbath day."
[59:54] My that's the that's the that's the
[59:57] entire key to he's the one who created
[59:59] the Sabbath now was the Sabbath made for
[1:00:02] man or was man made for this Jesus asked
[1:00:04] that question and he said the Sabbath is
[1:00:06] made for you and it's been made for you
[1:00:09] and I to have a day of rest
[1:00:11] and we yet we you know use it the other
[1:00:14] way
[1:00:16] now so this is the just the beginning of
[1:00:18] Matthew 12:9 and when he was departed
[1:00:20] thence he went into their synagogue
[1:00:23] So now he just got done talking to him
[1:00:25] and saying, "Listen, you can you can eat
[1:00:28] on the, you know, if there's a need and
[1:00:29] you need to eat on the Sabbath, go have
[1:00:31] if your ox is in the ditch. David did a
[1:00:33] certain thing." So now he just now he
[1:00:35] goes and he goes into their synagogue
[1:00:37] and there was a man which had his hand
[1:00:38] withered. And they asked him, saying,
[1:00:40] "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath
[1:00:42] days?" And they even asked him that for
[1:00:44] that they would have reason to accuse
[1:00:46] him.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Think about that. He just got done
[1:00:48] telling him and teaching them. And I'm
[1:00:50] no better, by the way. Many times I
[1:00:52] listen to a tape and I hear the prophet
[1:00:53] of God say something and he just got
[1:00:55] done teaching me and I turn off the tape
[1:00:57] and I go doing the same mistake. So I'm
[1:00:58] not not guilty of doing what they did
[1:01:00] here. But Lord help us not to be like
[1:01:03] this where he just got done teaching us
[1:01:05] and maybe we could learn a bit. Say so
[1:01:07] so they want to accuse him and that and
[1:01:09] he says unto them, what man shall there
[1:01:10] be among you that shall have one sheep
[1:01:12] and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath
[1:01:14] day will he not lay hold on it and lift
[1:01:16] it out? Or how much then is a man better
[1:01:19] than a sheep? If you would get your
[1:01:21] sheep out of the ditch on a on the
[1:01:23] Sabbath, this man can't be healed on the
[1:01:25] Sabbath. Of course he can. Then saith he
[1:01:28] to the man, stretch forth thine hand,
[1:01:29] and he stretched it forth, and it
[1:01:30] restored whole like as the other. Then
[1:01:32] the Pharisees went out and held a
[1:01:34] council against him, how they might
[1:01:36] destroy him. But when Jesus knew it, he
[1:01:40] withdrew himself from then, and great
[1:01:42] multitudes followed them, and he healed
[1:01:44] them all.
[1:01:46] Notice he he began to draw back from the
[1:01:49] counsel that was against him. It wasn't
[1:01:51] the time yet. There would be a time, but
[1:01:54] it wasn't that time right then. But he
[1:01:56] withdrew him. But but many come with
[1:01:58] him, obviously, and he healed great
[1:02:00] multitudes, the Bible said. And he
[1:02:01] healed them all, and he charged them
[1:02:03] that they should not make him known.
[1:02:07] And then Matthew says this, "That it
[1:02:09] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:02:12] Isaiah the prophet, saying, now he
[1:02:15] begins to quote Isaiah 42."
[1:02:18] He goes back there, verse 18, "Behold my
[1:02:20] servant whom I have chosen, my beloved
[1:02:22] in whom my soul is well pleased. I will
[1:02:24] put my spirit upon him, and he shall
[1:02:26] show judgment to the Gentiles. He will
[1:02:28] not strive."
[1:02:30] He didn't fight with them there. They
[1:02:32] began to take counsel against him to
[1:02:34] destroy him, and he just withdraws.
[1:02:36] There's a time that, you know, it's
[1:02:38] going to be a time for him to be to be
[1:02:40] crucified, but it wasn't the time yet.
[1:02:42] He He doesn't strive. He doesn't cry.
[1:02:45] Neither shall any man hear his voice in
[1:02:47] the streets. He begins to draw back. And
[1:02:49] and Matthew says, "This is what
[1:02:51] happened." And he says, "A bruised reed
[1:02:53] shall he not break, and a smoking flax
[1:02:55] shall he not quench till he shall send
[1:02:57] forth judgment unto victory, and in his
[1:03:00] name shall the Gentiles trust." Isn't it
[1:03:03] beautiful how the Lord gave us even, you
[1:03:06] know, with the matters of the law and
[1:03:09] judgment and mercy? There's a brother I
[1:03:10] was talking to the other day and he
[1:03:12] might be watching. It wouldn't mention
[1:03:13] his name, but but he's an older brother.
[1:03:16] And he says that uh he knew Sister
[1:03:18] Francis, brother Donald, and this, you
[1:03:20] know, it's been a years since we heard
[1:03:22] that name, but she was a wonderful lady,
[1:03:26] like a sister Darlene, sister. I was
[1:03:28] telling sister Danette cuz she never met
[1:03:29] her and I said she was kind of like a
[1:03:31] sister Darlene you know but anyway so
[1:03:33] this brother he was feeling guilty about
[1:03:35] you know working and exercising and
[1:03:37] keeping his body in shape and he went
[1:03:40] and began to talk to sister Francis
[1:03:41] about it and she looked at him and she
[1:03:44] goes well does it help you
[1:03:48] a bruised reed will not break
[1:03:52] does it help you just a simple answer
[1:03:56] God in simplicity Anyway,
[1:03:58] so that that's off the subject. Now
[1:04:00] Isaiah 42 and verse5 and we're going to
[1:04:02] have prayer service. So I want to spend
[1:04:03] maybe the last little time here with a
[1:04:05] little faith building. The Bible says,
[1:04:07] so now it's it's the same passions of
[1:04:09] scripture here. Isaiah 42, thus sayaith
[1:04:11] God the Lord, he that created the
[1:04:13] heavens and stretched them out. He that
[1:04:16] spread forth the earth, and that which
[1:04:18] cometh off of it, he that giveth breath
[1:04:20] unto the people on it, and spirit to
[1:04:23] them that walk therein. And he's he's
[1:04:25] speaking now. And brother Brandham on
[1:04:27] the the message future home. He begins
[1:04:29] to talk and most of that sermon is
[1:04:32] actually talking about the earth just as
[1:04:34] it is now. and then comparing your
[1:04:37] experience to the experience of the
[1:04:40] earth. Not just your experience the last
[1:04:43] 70 years as experience with the earth
[1:04:45] over 70 years, but he takes your
[1:04:46] experience as a Christian and and what
[1:04:49] the earth has gone through, you know,
[1:04:50] 2,000 years after after the days of
[1:04:53] Adam, how how Noah would come along and
[1:04:56] it would be washed with water. And then
[1:04:59] he said 2,000 years later and just
[1:05:01] begins to talk and and there I had many
[1:05:03] quotes there but I had to take them out
[1:05:04] because it would be too long but Sister
[1:05:06] Pauline if you have that that that slide
[1:05:08] and then it was justified and then the
[1:05:10] Lord Jesus came and it was baptized or
[1:05:12] sanctified by blood and then the end
[1:05:15] time it's going to be burned and all the
[1:05:17] desires of it and brother Brandham words
[1:05:19] it like this the atmospheres of the
[1:05:21] earth will be burned and and as
[1:05:23] atmospheres he talks about the politics
[1:05:26] the corruption and the evil spirits he
[1:05:28] says Now, those spirits are allowed to
[1:05:30] inhabit these realms to accuse you. He
[1:05:33] actually says there's a there's a quote.
[1:05:35] I don't think we have it here, but but
[1:05:36] he says they'll there'll be a day when
[1:05:38] they're all burned out and they won't be
[1:05:40] able to accuse you anymore. Well, that
[1:05:41] day is coming when when all the
[1:05:43] atmospheres of evil, the the prince of
[1:05:46] the darkness is going to be burned out
[1:05:48] completely and he won't be able to
[1:05:50] accuse us before the father. Brother Bam
[1:05:52] says this, I'll make a new heaven and a
[1:05:54] new earth. See that the heavens will be
[1:05:56] gone and the earth will be gone. That
[1:05:58] see that the heavens will be gone and
[1:06:00] the earth will be gone. Now you have to
[1:06:02] listen to how he words this. He says
[1:06:05] completely annihilated but a close study
[1:06:08] and with the help of the Holy Spirit we
[1:06:10] can see the truth of this and that's
[1:06:12] what we're going into. It's only the
[1:06:13] atmospheres around it and the sin that's
[1:06:16] upon the earth that will be destroyed.
[1:06:19] See, when you get the Holy Ghost, you're
[1:06:21] not completely annihilated, but the
[1:06:23] atmosphere around you and all the sin is
[1:06:26] completely destroyed or annihilated from
[1:06:29] your life. So, it's the same. He's he's
[1:06:31] typing what happens with you and the new
[1:06:33] birth to the to the the annihilation of
[1:06:36] sin upon the earth. Same through the
[1:06:38] annihilation of sin on your life. What
[1:06:40] does it do then? these thistles and
[1:06:42] sickness and death and politics and
[1:06:44] sinful man and sinful woman and evil
[1:06:46] spirits will all be gone away and
[1:06:48] annihilated. See, it has to be done that
[1:06:50] way because we're going to live right
[1:06:52] here.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; I love that we're going to live right
[1:06:54] here. We'll prove that by the Bible
[1:06:56] right here. I might live at Lake Pal, by
[1:06:58] the way. But anyways, right here is
[1:06:59] where we live. Now, notice thistles,
[1:07:01] germs, all sicknesses and things will be
[1:07:04] completely taken away. All all this its
[1:07:06] existence that's in the earth now
[1:07:08] man-made systems, politics, sin, all
[1:07:10] kinds of evil spirits that's in the
[1:07:12] world is contaminated with and all the
[1:07:14] heavens above us here is contaminated
[1:07:16] with evil spirit. Now we're going to go
[1:07:18] deep and long and then and he did by the
[1:07:19] way. It's almost four hours. Satan is
[1:07:22] still here. That's the reason all these
[1:07:24] things happen. He's still here and all
[1:07:27] of his evil forces are still here.
[1:07:30] Notice that's why the earth now is so
[1:07:31] filthy. That's why the scum and
[1:07:33] ridiculous things that goes on,
[1:07:34] bloodshed, war, politics, sin, adulter,
[1:07:36] all kind of filthiness goes on is
[1:07:38] because that Satan is the ruler of this
[1:07:40] earth and this atmosphere. Now, think
[1:07:43] about it with your life. Now, he says
[1:07:45] Satan is still here, but he's not
[1:07:47] talking about the Christian. He's
[1:07:48] talking about this current earth in its
[1:07:51] current state that has not been
[1:07:53] completely cleansed yet. So, don't say
[1:07:55] that you could just, well, sin is still
[1:07:57] No, no, no. You're you're a different
[1:07:59] being than the earth is right now. I'm
[1:08:01] going to prove it just in a a quote
[1:08:03] here. Now, both the heavens and earth is
[1:08:05] contaminated with devils that can accuse
[1:08:07] Oh, here it is. That can accuse us
[1:08:09] before God. Jesus is there to intercede
[1:08:12] for us. See, while the accusers keep
[1:08:14] pointing a finger, they did this, you
[1:08:16] know, brother Steve did that and brother
[1:08:18] Donald did this and brother Kurt did
[1:08:19] that. He said, but the blood covers.
[1:08:22] Amen. He came to redeem that elected
[1:08:24] that he foresaw. That's why it's for so
[1:08:26] filthy today. Listen, there's something
[1:08:28] that covers that. Even when those devils
[1:08:31] are still here to accuse, one day
[1:08:32] they're going to be wiped out. But even
[1:08:34] then, there's a God they can point all
[1:08:36] the fingers he wants cuz Jesus God just
[1:08:38] looks back and goes, "Don't you see the
[1:08:40] blood that covers all that that they've
[1:08:42] accepted?" All right. Now,
[1:08:46] and notice how God makes it plain. And
[1:08:48] I'm I'm fast forwarding many paragraphs
[1:08:50] here, but go if you want, listen to the
[1:08:52] tape. It's really, really wonderful. And
[1:08:53] God makes plain to us his plan of
[1:08:56] redemption. Oh, this just thrilled my
[1:08:57] soul when I saw it. How he makes plain
[1:08:59] to us here now his plan of redemption.
[1:09:02] Now compare what we see with our own
[1:09:03] eyes. What God has come to redeem this
[1:09:06] world. He's done the same plan to redeem
[1:09:09] his people.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; For the unchangeable God changes not in
[1:09:13] any of his plans or anything such a
[1:09:15] glorious thing. But now it has to go
[1:09:17] through baptism of fire.
[1:09:19] You do too. Holy fire from God which
[1:09:23] cleanses the earth and the heavens
[1:09:24] around it. Then it's purchased so that
[1:09:25] the redeemed can live on it. Live in
[1:09:28] peace. Notice the baptism of fire is to
[1:09:31] cleanse it from sin, from sickness, from
[1:09:34] disease, germs. Notice just what he says
[1:09:37] there from sinners, from the devil and
[1:09:39] all his group. He is to be cast out into
[1:09:41] the lake of fire. Holy fire from God
[1:09:43] comes down from God out of heaven and
[1:09:45] burns it up. Notice to make it ready for
[1:09:47] God to dwell in.
[1:09:49] That's you. That's the earth. But he's
[1:09:52] making a type here now. He says
[1:09:57] for God in the new world that is to come
[1:09:59] is to dwell in the earth. Cuz you say
[1:10:00] God, he dwells in the human heart. But
[1:10:02] he and the bride becomes one and they go
[1:10:05] to their home in the new world. And the
[1:10:07] same plan of redemption is used to
[1:10:10] redeem both world and the persons that
[1:10:14] live in it.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; That ought to make somebody happy today.
[1:10:18] So the same plan of redemption, baptism,
[1:10:21] sanctification,
[1:10:22] uh, uh, water baptism and and baptism of
[1:10:25] the Holy Ghost that's going to happen to
[1:10:27] the earth happened, the same plan
[1:10:30] happens to the world and the persons
[1:10:32] that live in it. He said, notice Satan
[1:10:34] was will be taken from the earth. This
[1:10:37] is my favorite one all night. Satan was
[1:10:40] will be taken from earth. Now notice he
[1:10:42] changes.
[1:10:44] He changes. Now he will future be taken
[1:10:47] from earth. Just exactly like Satan was
[1:10:50] taken from you.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; So now it's passed. So now he's going to
[1:10:57] be taken from the earth. He was taken
[1:10:59] from you. Now that don't mean he can't
[1:11:01] he could still tempt you. He's going to
[1:11:03] say that here. He could but he was taken
[1:11:05] from you.
[1:11:07] That ought to make somebody happy. That
[1:11:09] makes me happy if nobody else. All
[1:11:10] right. Notice he Satan was taken was t
[1:11:13] so he's going to be taken from the
[1:11:14] earth. He's there accusing and politics.
[1:11:17] You don't have to look very far on
[1:11:18] YouTube to find a politics and
[1:11:19] everything going on. So, he will be
[1:11:21] taken from the earth, but he was taken
[1:11:23] from you.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot bother or he can tempt
[1:11:30] anybody, you know, no one's going to
[1:11:32] deny that, right? Like, but he cannot
[1:11:35] get a born again Christian for God from
[1:11:37] the foundation of the world foresaw him
[1:11:40] and sent Jesus to redeem him and the
[1:11:42] blood speaks for him. How can he sin
[1:11:46] when it can't be seen even by God? He
[1:11:49] don't even The only thing he hears is
[1:11:51] your voice. He sees your representation.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's just a that's a
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; man. That'll preach right there. By the
[1:11:58] same means for the world is one of his
[1:12:00] attributes. Now, notice this world like
[1:12:03] earth, not politics and filth of it, but
[1:12:05] the the very earth that we're on is one
[1:12:08] of his attributes.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just the same as you are one of
[1:12:13] his attributes.
[1:12:15] The world becomes one of his attributes
[1:12:18] because it was in God's it was God's
[1:12:20] thinking in the beginning to have a
[1:12:22] world to be on a throne to be a king or
[1:12:24] to be a redeemer to be a healer and
[1:12:26] that's his attributes
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; and he used the same oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:12:30] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:12:30] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:12:30] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh my okay I got
[1:12:31] to go let me read this why I don't have
[1:12:32] it on powerpoint but let me read it.
[1:12:33] Heavens and earth will pass away. Now
[1:12:36] this word means passing from one form to
[1:12:38] another. It does not mean annihilation
[1:12:42] as the English word would mean pass
[1:12:44] away. It's annihilated. But the Hebrew
[1:12:45] or Greek word here does not mean pass
[1:12:47] away. This is in future home also. It
[1:12:49] means passing from one thing to another.
[1:12:54] To pass from one condition to another.
[1:12:57] So I passed from sinner condition to a
[1:13:00] different condition. You say he passed
[1:13:02] away. Well, I did pass away in a sense
[1:13:04] because the old man, he's no longer
[1:13:05] there. But I passed from a condition of
[1:13:07] a a sinner spotted by the world to a
[1:13:10] condition completely unspotted by the
[1:13:13] world under the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:15] So I didn't pass away die but I passed
[1:13:18] away from a condition of filth to a
[1:13:20] condition of purity before God. Now
[1:13:22] brother Abraham says and he used the
[1:13:24] same word when he said to the cult said
[1:13:26] loose the cult and let him go. Said the
[1:13:28] same thing at the resurrection of
[1:13:29] Lazarus loose him change him. He changed
[1:13:32] the condition of death that he's in to
[1:13:34] life. If he'd been tied, let him go.
[1:13:36] What does it mean? The earth will be
[1:13:37] loosed from the grip of Satan. It'll be
[1:13:39] loosed from from politics. It'll be
[1:13:41] loosed from denominational religious
[1:13:43] systems to be used for the kingdom of
[1:13:46] God. This very earth is going to be
[1:13:48] loosed from all that garbage to be God's
[1:13:51] to be established here on earth. But as
[1:13:53] long as it's in the hands of Satan,
[1:13:55] Satan is the ruler of the earth. He owns
[1:13:57] it belong to him. But now Christ has
[1:13:58] redeemed it. Now he's talking about the
[1:14:00] time coming. No, now we just this will
[1:14:03] be the last one.
[1:14:05] One time I was his property.
[1:14:09] One time that little woman was his
[1:14:12] property. It's not about Satan's
[1:14:14] property, but not now. See, he come to
[1:14:16] loose the grip of it. He loosed the grip
[1:14:18] of sin, of Satan upon my life, upon your
[1:14:20] life. And now we're not his. Have you
[1:14:22] often heard me say in prayer, take your
[1:14:24] hands off God's property.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; So when you go down to pray this
[1:14:27] evening, say something like this. Take
[1:14:29] your hands off God's property. Sister
[1:14:30] Vivian lying there in the ER or ICU.
[1:14:33] Satan, take your hands off God's
[1:14:36] property.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:14:41] You have faith to claim your own. That's
[1:14:43] your rights. Take your hands off her.
[1:14:46] Take your hands off. MC faith will do
[1:14:47] it. Oh my. Not annihilate it,
[1:14:51] but just take your hands off of it or
[1:14:53] loose it. Let it go. Pass it away. It
[1:14:56] changes. The earth will change. Politics
[1:14:58] will change. Religions will change. The
[1:15:00] denominations will pass away. Politics
[1:15:02] will pass away. The kingdom of God shall
[1:15:06] be established.
[1:15:07] I give us a tiny bit of faith this
[1:15:10] evening to
[1:15:12] get down and say loose
[1:15:15] and loose. Even you know Satan will try
[1:15:18] to inflict our thoughts and our minds
[1:15:21] and you know loose me from all that you
[1:15:26] know all that anxiety and all those
[1:15:27] things that come upon you. Loose me from
[1:15:29] that. I'm not Satan's property.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; I'm God's property. I've been bought.
[1:15:34] Notice he said, "And what will happen to
[1:15:36] the earth?" The same thing that happened
[1:15:37] to you. Satan no longer has possession.
[1:15:40] That's how we got to believe as saints
[1:15:42] of God. He did have possession. He could
[1:15:44] control me any way he wanted. And now he
[1:15:46] tempts me. Sure, I fall sometimes. That
[1:15:48] don't change the fact I'm under the
[1:15:50] blood. I got representation. Point all
[1:15:52] your finger all you want, Satan. I'm
[1:15:54] under the blood of Jesus Christ. And
[1:15:56] when you point your finger, it's about
[1:15:57] 50 pointing right back at you. All
[1:16:00] right. Praise the Lord. I got to stop
[1:16:02] preaching.
[1:16:05] All right. Who? Okay, we got prayer
[1:16:06] requests.
[1:16:09] Amen. Okay. Brother Rolando had one for
[1:16:12] a sister in Paraguay.
[1:16:16] Sister Lordes,
[1:16:18] friend of his. I mentioned Sister
[1:16:21] Vivian. I went and saw her today and she
[1:16:24] has an amazing family. I met her two
[1:16:27] sisters. They are just wonderful
[1:16:29] Christian ladies. Their dad, uh, there
[1:16:32] might have been more than the three of
[1:16:33] them, but there was at least the three
[1:16:35] of them. Their father was the pastor of
[1:16:37] Grey Mountain Bible Church for many,
[1:16:40] many years. So, she comes from and she
[1:16:43] told all, "Yeah, we we heard that." She
[1:16:45] said she found a church up here in
[1:16:47] Flagstaff. she's going to. And anyways,
[1:16:49] it thrilled my heart to hear them talk
[1:16:51] about it. So, I went and saw her.
[1:16:54] There's conditions there, but I mean,
[1:16:57] Lazarus had the worst conditions you
[1:16:59] think of. You know, he had some rough
[1:17:01] conditions, but he got loosed. Amen. So,
[1:17:05] Sister Vivian, and then yes, Sister
[1:17:06] Pauline, if you'd put those up there.
[1:17:09] Lordes,
[1:17:11] yes, it's not his sister. It's a sister
[1:17:13] in Paraguay. It's L Our R-s.
[1:17:16] Does anybody Sister Sakoro
[1:17:20] Senor Vendiga
[1:17:22] Amen. We remember her as well. Brother
[1:17:24] Ryan, by the way, is at his father's in
[1:17:26] Cottonwood ministering for him this
[1:17:28] evening. Don't want to forget to mention
[1:17:29] that.
[1:17:32] Do we have any others? Sister Darlene.
[1:17:39] Yeah.
[1:17:41] Yeah.
[1:17:49] Amen. That's good. Strength, wisdom, and
[1:17:51] to feel his presence. That's sister Bel,
[1:17:53] Sister Rose. Very good. Brother Tim.
[1:17:59] Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Uh coworker. I
[1:18:01] forget the last name. It was a Hispanic
[1:18:03] last name. Does anybody remember it?
[1:18:06] My phone.
[1:18:08] Have hand that to Sister Pauline when
[1:18:10] you find that name. Brother Tim,
[1:18:13] anybody else,
[1:18:16] Brother Kurt, and Brother Tom? Get
[1:18:18] Brother Tom and then Brother Kurt.
[1:18:22] Sister Cindy. Amen.
[1:18:28] Then Brother Kurt
[1:18:38] over here. Brother Chase.
[1:18:50] Traveling mercies.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; I consider it missionary work. Amen.
[1:18:54] Amen. Traveling mercies for brother
[1:18:56] Kirk. Going to see some family.
[1:19:01] Anyone else?
[1:19:03] Sister Janette.
[1:19:07] Like brother Glenn. Yes.
[1:19:10] been sick for a little bit.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:19:15] I went to church to pray for me. U
[1:19:18] Kathy, my sister, had a veteran a VA
[1:19:22] official come out and talk to me and
[1:19:25] they're wanting to put me in some kind
[1:19:27] of hospital or something and and I got
[1:19:30] to go along with everything they're
[1:19:32] telling me to do. I don't know what to
[1:19:35] do, but I'm leaving in the Lord's hands
[1:19:37] and I love this church. So, I'm going to
[1:19:39] believe in the church and God and my
[1:19:42] pastor. I'll talk with you more about
[1:19:44] it.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; But I'm I'm not afraid to talk. I just
[1:19:49] lost it. And
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; I just my mind just went boom. I don't
[1:19:54] know why, but it just happened to me. I
[1:19:56] was doing fine one day, and next day I
[1:19:58] woke up, couldn't remember where I was
[1:20:00] at. Couldn't even remember my name. And
[1:20:02] it's like a kid being born again. And I
[1:20:05] had to learn to do everything.
[1:20:07] Everything I've been doing now. I
[1:20:08] actually had to learn and it's horrible.
[1:20:12] I feel like I'm just like and it's just
[1:20:15] like a disaster to me. You mean my life
[1:20:18] was like this? Was it like this? No,
[1:20:21] you're wrong. You're being stupid again.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; We'll remember. We'll remember you,
[1:20:27] brother Everett. And
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; pray for me,
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Sister Katherine. And brother Jeremiah
[1:20:31] as well.
[1:20:33] Amen.
[1:20:34] Praise the Lord. At this time for our
[1:20:36] visitors, just go to prayer where you're
[1:20:38] at and then when you're finished
[1:20:39] praying, you just leave quietly through
[1:20:41] the back door there. I have their
[1:20:43] brother put some music on while we're
[1:20:44] praying. Praise the Lord. Lord bless
[1:20:46] you.
