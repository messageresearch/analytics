Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Woo! Woo! Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. And Lord, you are so to me. You are so gracious to me. Lord again. Yeah, you are. So you my Heat. Heat. Oh, you love me. Amen. Amen. It's the truth. You know those little moments I confess my faults. I come out in situations like this sometimes having a wonderful morning with my Lord and Savior and I find myself trying to jump at something that trying to make it work instead of just relaxing and resting in him. So I'm I just needed that little bit. I knew he was near. I just needed to know that I can rest in him. Amen. Amen. I just want to please the Lord. Amen. And truly, I think that that's each one of our desires before we turn this service to brother Donald. I just want to please the Lord. And if you feel like you haven't in your flesh this week, well, just tell him so. But then if he were part of his, he knew and he sees you as perfect from the foundation of the world. So he's not threatened over this flesh. He's threatened in the fact if we don't accept him. That's what he frets about. So I just want to please the Lord. Oh, I just want to please the Lord. Be in his will in every way. To be lost in his presence. Found in his likeness. Yeah. Well done. Oh, heat, heat. Good morning. &gt;&gt; Lord bless you. Um couldn't uh help myself but get a little excited by the rain this morning. &gt;&gt; Uh we had a farmer roll through town on Wednesday night or farmer's son and kicked the dust balls a little bit and said, "Well, all that's need now is a good rain, right?" That's what he told us. Uh Lord said, "You see what I provided for you?" And I said, "Yeah." I said, "So, not only am I thankful for the natural rain that we were given this morning, but I am expecting a Holy Spirit rain this morning, heavenly father Lord, that would just soften us and make us so ready to receive something this morning." So, we do have a uh psalm reading. Uh we'll turn to Psalms uh 68 and uh if we can uh we'll read verses 1 uh to 9. Um, I'll read the first, uh, you you folks read the second, and then if we could just read that last ninth verse together, um, and then, uh, we'll take some prayer requests. So, sounds like the Bibles are still turning here. So, we'll just give it just a minute. But, uh, Psalms, uh, chapter 68, uh, verse one, and, uh, we'll read through nine. Let's all read nine together again. Let God arise. Let his enemies be scattered. Let them also that hate him flee before him. As smoke is driven away. As wax melt before the fire, so let the wicked perish in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; But let the righteous be glad. Let them rejoice before God. &gt;&gt; Yay, let them exceedingly rejoice. Sing praises to his name that heavens and rejoice before him. &gt;&gt; A father of the fatherless, a judge of the widows is God in his holy habitation. God inamilies. He found the rebellious dwell in a dry land. Oh God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didest march through the wilderness, say the earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God. Eveni was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel. altogether. Thou, oh God, did ascend a plentiful reign, whereby thou did confirm thy inheritance when it was weary. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a prayer request here. Um says, uh please pray for sister Karen and myself. We'll be traveling to Shreveport um for Thanksgiving, leaving this week also for our health. Sister Karen has a persistent cough. Thank you, brother Glenn. Um, there was no other request turned in, but if you have one this morning, we serve a mighty mighty God that's willing to grant all your requests. So, raise your hand to him. Just uh take these uh to the Lord. Dear heavenly father, Lord, &gt;&gt; we may feel weary some mornings, Lord. We may feel tired. We may feel anxious. We may feel scared, Lord, but we just read a scripture that says we can confirm our inheritance, heavenly father. Lord, and Lord, that's what we're all doing here this morning, Lord, as we we got up and we bundled up and we headed on in to confirm our inheritance, heavenly father. Lord, and you are that inheritance, Lord. Lord, we ask that you be with these requests that were brought forth, Lord. That you be with Brother Glenn and Sister Karen as they travel, Lord. may just be a time of joyous fellowship with one another and with you, heavenly father. Lord, and we also speak against that demon that's been inlecting infecting brother Glenn affecting him. Lord, this cough hurting sister Karen. Heavenly Father, Lord, we rebuke those things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. They can't stand no more. They have no more power. Lord, you are the overcomer, the conqueror, heavenly father.

Heavenly Father, Lord, we just are so grateful that you can come and provide for us, heavenly father, Lord, and give us all of the blessings that we need. Lord, ask that you be with the service. Lord, I'm expecting from you this morning, Heavenly Father, Lord, that it not just be another church service, Lord, but Lord, that some stakes would be driven today, Heavenly Father, Lord, that some sicknesses would be healed today, heavenly father, Lord. Lord, you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. And we believe that with all of our hearts, Lord. Thank you for all that you've done for us in Jesus blessed, holy name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Greet the one next to you, and you may be seated. Brother Ryan, don't drift too far from that song. We're going to go back to it. So, amen. I'm sorry. Bless you. Bless you. If the Holy Spirit be pleased, I thought, Lord, I'd just look at these words and contemplate as I hear the music. So maybe we just take a moment and just each one speak to your God and listen to the words in manner. Then go ahead my brother. Lord, we lifted again. I give you all the praise and all the glory. I come for another reason but to lift you up. May you find pleasure, Lord. May be pleased. You touch it so well. Let's sing this verse again to him with I will proclaim.

He was slain to reconcile me &gt;&gt; to God. Amen. Amen. Brother Ryan, how pleased I am to be in the Holy Spirit's presence. Uh before we go in, I'm we're going to start with looking for a city, but I want to I want to pass a little rose out. I this rain we thankful that for this rain but I asked brother Tom I said brother Tom what do you think should we we're short on deacons would you think it'd be all right to ask maybe some of the young men to help out with an umbrella and he said yeah I think it'd be all right well maybe some of you were recipients of that umbrella but brother William thank you &gt;&gt; that is truly putting what you believe into action. Amen. Amen. So, thank you. I mean that. And I don't want to pay take it away from anybody else. It's just I just was one of those things. Um I'm looking for a city. Amen. Amen. You're looking for a city. You satisfied with uh here? I'm not. I think I'm a little bit too satisfied with here. But each day just sort of lights that fire under me. and I'm looking for a city and uh I dream about it. I think about it. My imagination can't even contain what it is. So, I'm singing of something that I'm looking to actually have manifested one of these days. Looking for a city, the one I made by hand. I'm looking over Jordan. I see the promised land. The water will be parted. I'll be on my way. As I'm crossing over Jordan, I will say now I have that ever within since Jesus took away my sin. The moment that he blessed me, he made me fully. He put that last Jordan in my soul. I'm drinking from the fountain that flowth from on high. Oh well, a blessed water that never shall run dry. I'm God's man. I pray day by day and that everlasting joy you say I have everlasting since Jesus took away my sin. The moment that he blessed me, he made me fully. He put that everlasting in my soul. I heard the prophet message. I placed it in my heart. I've got the revelation that never shall. The rapture is upon us. The stage is set to go. Now we have this precious brother. We all know within Jesus took away my sin. The moment that he bless me, he made me fully. He never join. Oh, I'm looking for the city. No one made my hand. Oh, I'm looking for Jordan. I see the promised land. No water will be falling. And I'll be on my way. As I join King Jesus took away my sadd everlasting Jordan in my soul. Oh my go Jesus took away my sin.

Would you help me? Would you sing that for me? No turning back. I just not that I need a little bit of strength. I just Good to hear me, Lord. Just voices. I don't know how to explain it to you. I sat and listened. I think it does it good to to tell you where my inspiration this morning. I sat and listened. I played songs and brother the Cloverdale up in Canada um brother passed on brother uh Biscll and he was the one that was singing this song and I wasn't there but I could just recognize what he was doing. Now, here's a man that had the privilege that I didn't do that he got to walk with the prophet. He got to talk with the prophet. All that I'm sure that he was wonderfully thinking of when he was singing this song, but he set it all aside and I could hear in his voice and he was telling his Lord and Savior. So, it became just him and his Lord singing this song and oh, he got into it. I have decided to follow Jesus. Amen. Amen. Sing it with me. I'm sorry. Pray that you don't think I'm too crazy, but I'm just crazy enough to think that he hears. He knows he's walking with me. He's right here beside me or I'm beside him. The Lord forgive me that he I'm beside him. I've decided to follow Jesus. Amen. Amen. Sing it with me. Decided to follow Jesus. I decided to follow Jesus. I have desired to follow Jesus. I won't turn back. Lord, God help me. I won't turn back. I desire today to follow Jesus. Oh, I've decided to follow Jesus. I've decided to follow Jesus. No turning back. No turning back. Amen. Amen. We'll take up our morning offering. Amen. Amen. Is there brother? Are we taking up an offering? All right. So, man, as there brothers are coming, want to make mention that brother Ryan, Lord willing, will be speaking Wednesday and then uh I believe Brother Steve and then we'll be back after that. So, I want to pray much for that. Amen. Brother Bill, would you pray over offering? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. You promise, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Truth, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Don't believe we had any other announcements. Um, I didn't, Brother Donnie. I'm sorry I didn't get the Sunday school report, but uh I know that there was a Sunday school report and we thank those that were there. Amen.

Amen. Amen. You young people, I want you to go home and I want you to ask your mama and daddy who wrote that song and the story behind it because it's greater than just words. It's greater than just words. Came from a suffering of a man. And yet he put his total trust in a God to say like I say, it is well with my soul. It is well with my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. And listen, we change the order of service. Invite our brother out and Amazing Grace, Brother Digs. And he's been traveling. Brother Kurt could ask him where he's traveling for him. He's been preaching for a little while and my heart went to him this morning. I thought, I wonder if he's missing home a little bit. Maybe Smith and his children, but he gave it all up to come and do what he felt he was called to do. So Lord, I I want to give you full attention, Lord. Not a man. A man just dedicated himself, gave himself that God may use him to speak through. And I want to at least be honorable enough to my Lord and Savior to listen and hear. Amazing grace. as we invite our brother in. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that save like me. Heat Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. There we go. Amen. Is everybody happy to be in the house that we have? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be at Flagstaff again. Amen. We thank God for the mercy he's given us. And like the brother said, anything we can do to be a help, that's what we want to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh I know you all come to see the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So we welcome him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And without him, this would be just an ordinary gathering. &gt;&gt; But we believe God is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow in a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God. If you have an unspoken request, you can acknowledge it by uplifted hand. Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, Father, we here today, Lord, in your house of worship on the merits of your mercy and grace, Lord, knowing that it's nothing we've done, but it's your choosing, Lord. So father we pray you take us beyond just the church building just beyond just the testimony of old but Lord God we want you to have your way today father Lord God and you speak to us aresh Lord and give us instruction Lord God and show us Lord what to let go and what to embrace &gt;&gt; and Lord God we'll just be careful to give you the honor and glory Lord and we pray you will bless a pastor Lord as he's traveling Lord and bless his services, Father. And Lord, that you be glorified in those meetings, Lord. And Father God, we pray that the Holy Spirit today in this place would dominate the service, Lord. Dominate our bodies, souls, and spirit. Lord, that it'll be nothing about us, but it'll be all you, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the wonderful and matchless name of Jesus Christ, we pray. At church, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's go to um Psalms 86. Psalms 86 and then we're going to go to 2 Chronicles chapter 20. Psalms 86 and verse 6. If you have to say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplication. In the day of my trouble, I will call upon thee, for thou will answer me among the gods. There is none unto thee. There is none like unto thee, oh Lord, neither are there any works like unto thy works." Amen. Let's go to 2 Chronicles chapter 20. Let's start at verse um 30 I mean verse 15. 2 Chronicles 20 and 15. The Bible says, "And he said, and he said, hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and thou king Jehoshaphat. Thus said the Lord unto you. Be not afraid nor dismayed by reasoning of this great multitude." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the battle is not yours, but God's. Tomorrow go ye down against them. Behold, they come up by the cliff of Z, and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of Jurro. Amen. May the Lord a bless reading of his word. You can have your seats today. Today I I I have a a simple thought, but I think it's very very timely. Amen. Cuz uh um one thing about the word of God, it never gets old. &gt;&gt; It's always fresh and fresh because God is eternal. He never he never runs out. There is no expiration date with God. &gt;&gt; So when we hear the word of God, we ought to take it in close. Amen. And we ought to say, even if you've heard it before, you ought to ask the question, Lord, what are you trying to show me? And you know, I know we've we've heard we've seen these scriptures before, you know, that the battle is not yours, it's the Lord's, you know, but today I I want to deal with words of affirmation. Words of affirmation. Amen. And let's let's think about God. God is his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God. And we know we know the scripture. But how do we handle God when it comes to the word? Amen. And you know what I began to ask myself is what did Jehoshaphat do to get an answer from God like this? &gt;&gt; Think about it, church. Wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't it mean something so good to you if God would whisper in your ear this morning, the battle's not yours? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it's mine. &gt;&gt; No matter what it look like, no matter what you going through, you don't have to fight. This is my battle this morning. What what what would it mean for us this morning if we would have that kind of assurance? &gt;&gt; It could look so dark. It could look so messy. But just to have God tell us, &gt;&gt; don't worry. &gt;&gt; Bless his name. &gt;&gt; I got it. Oh my brother. You know, so I was I was looking at this and and I began to think that, you know, uh what did Jehoshaphat do &gt;&gt; that God would come and give him such a word of assurance? &gt;&gt; And then God began to take me back to his word &gt;&gt; and that God is his word. &gt;&gt; God loves his word. &gt;&gt; And when we approach God, we approach through the revelation of his word. So church, if we come to God, we got to come back through those same channels. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to use God's own word on him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I hope y'all catching what I'm saying now. Hallelujah. Because God cannot hallelujah. do anything but what's in his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you know when I think about this affirmation and uh words of affirmation, &gt;&gt; you know, there was a study and I don't quite know. &gt;&gt; Hold on a second. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There was a study uh I don't know who the author, whatever it is, but there's a study called Love Languages. &gt;&gt; Are we familiar with that? I know most married folks are, but there's a study called love languages and and I'm not going to get into all of it, you know, but the one that caught me was words of affirmation, &gt;&gt; you know. And what does it mean to give your spouse words of affirmation? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, we just look at it for a second. Words of affirmation are positive and encouraging statements. Amen. When was the last time you gave your spouse positive and encouraging statements, words of affirmation? See, when we think, Amen, how we deal with one another, &gt;&gt; what the enemy wants us to do is always identify the negative first. But I guarantee you, you know that that old thing they would do where they would take a sheet of paper and they draw a line and they say, "Write everything that you like and everything that you don't like about one another." And most time, most of the time, I see some of the sisters smiling. Come on, brothers. Do better. Hallelujah. But you know, sometimes that that don't like list, it gets very very very long. But then you look at what you like and it could be some short things. So the list might not even be as long. But then once you start to go down memory lane, &gt;&gt; when you start to go back and you ask yourself, why do I love this person? How did I fall in love? And all these things start to make you bubble again. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for this. When your sister start thinking about Hallelujah. when you first fell in love with your husband and you know there's something about those stages where you want to be sexy again. Oh, I know we too spiritual for those kind of words. Hallelujah. But you ain't looking for certain times in your life or your relationship for your wife to come in the bedroom with a Bible, but you're looking for affirmation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're looking for Amen. her to express that love, him to express that love. Church, if we can do that with one another, what about God? &gt;&gt; How many times when you talk about God, do you have positive, encouraging words? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God say, "God loves to be worshiped." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He loves to be worshiped. Church &gt;&gt; church. Amen. Think about it. Sisters, your husband, he can come home from a hard day at work and you can just say something that seems real connor real carnal. Hey, big boy. And that'll just get him the blessing. That'll get him to smile. Why? Because it's encouraging. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a whole another realm of what he experienced before he got home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But those words, hallelujah, what do they do? Amen. They allow that man, Hallelujah, to to to release, to relax. Hallelujah. To enjoy, Amen. what's about to come his way. What about God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God loves to be worshiped. &gt;&gt; He loves to be praised. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; But you know what? and and don't get mad at me. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; but let's think about it, &gt;&gt; okay? &gt;&gt; When it comes to worship and praise, &gt;&gt; we rely too much on somebody else doing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, when our precious brother was bringing me out just now, &gt;&gt; we were singing Amazing Grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when he stopped, the song stopped. &gt;&gt; Is it just him having Amazing Grace? him seeing how good God's grace is. Or is it all of us? &gt;&gt; So church, certain things we sing and do, we do it in unison, but it ought to be a revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It ought to be something that nobody can tell you about. It's been revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when we say how great thou are, Amen. There has to be something behind that. &gt;&gt; Amen. It has to be more than just religion. &gt;&gt; Praise his name. &gt;&gt; And Sunday morning, what other days y'all have service? Wednesday. &gt;&gt; Wednesday can just be a religious gathering. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when it means something to you, &gt;&gt; there's something special that comes out of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when we think about even in a natural relationship, words of affirmation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before your wife leaves the house, brothers, you look at her, you say, "Honey, you look beautiful today." &gt;&gt; She going to walk out of that house stepping &gt;&gt; cuz she saying, "My man told me I look good." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some old Ricky old slickster can come and say, "Ma, you look beautiful." You know, she'll say, "I know. My husband already told me, &gt;&gt; but when you Oh, I ain't want to go. Let me leave that alone. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Words of affirmation. &gt;&gt; And and and I'm going down on the natural realm first because I want us to see that natural types are spiritual. If you can't do it to your natural spouse, you're surely not doing it to God. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sisters, y'all get ready. They feel they going to go overboard. Praise the Lord. And there's nothing wrong with that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Words of affirmation, positive and encouraging statements used to express support. Now, we know God don't need Hallelujah. anything from us. &gt;&gt; But what I want you to understand is when we exalt God, we put him in position. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you're going through anything, you say, "Lord God, what?" Let's just say somebody's in here sick this morning. Hallelujah. Words of affirmation. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord my God, you said you are the Lord thy God that health thee from all thy diseases. &gt;&gt; What is God going to do with a word like that? He has to keep it. &gt;&gt; See church, we're not talking about flattery. It's really who he is. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; he's Jehovah &gt;&gt; Rafa. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The healer of my soul, &gt;&gt; the healer of my body, &gt;&gt; the healer of my mind, &gt;&gt; my spirit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the healer of everything that I stand in need of. &gt;&gt; That's who he is. &gt;&gt; So when things are tough, things are tight, I come to God with words of affirmation. &gt;&gt; Very good. Very good. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Encouraging words. You say, "God don't need to be encouraged." I beg your pardon. &gt;&gt; I beg your pardon. You say, "God don't need to be encouraged." Let me give you an example. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why did God choose David? He chose David because David was a man out of God's very own heart. Now, let's ask the question. Did David have to encourage himself? &gt;&gt; How did he do it? He went back to the things that God has already done. So David began to speak those blessings in his life back over him. Amen. And it put him in a position. It put him in an attitude of triumph. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A man out of God's very own heart. In the heat of a struggle, in the heat of a battle, he had to encourage himself. Where did that come from? It came from God. &gt;&gt; Yes, it did. &gt;&gt; David, encourage yourself. Don't worry about what's going on in the church. Amen. Hallelujah. You come here to see me. &gt;&gt; Not brother Digs, but Christ. We come to see Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We going somewhere by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Everybody. All right. &gt;&gt; Listen, church. He says uh express support and appreciation you know and love to one oneself or others. Listen it says a way to build words of affirmation is a way to build confidence and strengthen a relationship. &gt;&gt; Very good. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to know how to get closer to God? &gt;&gt; Lift him up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "If I be lifted up, I'll draw all men unto me." Hallelujah. God wants to receive your praise. &gt;&gt; Church, when God was all by himself, he was just eternal. Amen. That's what our prophet said. He said he was just eternal. Amen. But then because of who he was and all the things that were locked up in him that had to be expressed, he started to condescend. He started to come down. Amen. And as he came down, he be to change mask. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But he brought every step with him. &gt;&gt; He was eternal. Then he became Elohim. Elohim became eternal. Hallelujah. Then he dropped to the logos. The logos was self-existent and eternal. Then he became hallelujah spoken word. But as God began to create, what did he create first? Angels. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Cuz he wanted affirmation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He wanted praise. &gt;&gt; That was in him. He wanted praise. God wanted to be acknowledged. Hallelujah. So he created beings that every time they saw him in his presence, they would say, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty." And no matter, no matter what else they said, it was all about words of affirmation. Hallelujah. Positive words up in heaven, there was nothing ever spoken that was negative out of those angels mouth. &gt;&gt; What about us? That's true. &gt;&gt; And they've never even experienced redemption. &gt;&gt; They've never even experienced redemption. &gt;&gt; And everything came out of their mouth was holy, holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty. Well, church, I started to think about, you know, are we really free? &gt;&gt; Are we free, church? &gt;&gt; Free to worship. See, I've been I've been on this little &gt;&gt; this little spill of worship because you know what happens with us in worship? We put everything in it that stops us from worshiping. &gt;&gt; Well, it's just my nature. &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't black. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not Spanish. Um, well, it's it's just the way I What does that have to do with you giving God praise? It ain't no order of skin color that dictates worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And not only that, what we do is say, "Oh my, we worship according to sound." &gt;&gt; Oh man, you know that I just can't get into that because I don't know that song. What does that have to do with the inspiration? &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on &gt;&gt; right now. If I start singing a song you never heard but you can identify with the words. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If I start to say nobody greater nobody greater than you. &gt;&gt; You might not know that song but can you identify with it? If you can identify that there's nothing. You've tried it. Hallelujah. You've tried. Hallelujah. Everything out there in the world that the world has to offer. But all you can say is none of that is greater than the experience of knowing the Lord Jesus Christ. I searched all over. Couldn't find nobody. I searched high and low. Still couldn't find nobody. &gt;&gt; Nobody greater. &gt;&gt; Nobody greater than you. &gt;&gt; And we might start playing it on the piano and you say, "Well, I never heard it before." But can you identify with it? Yes. &gt;&gt; I never met Paul, but I can identify with him when he say, "Hallelujah, that death is swallowed up in victory." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I never met him, but I heard him say, "I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me." Hallelujah. We never shopped together in Walmart, but I can be identified with that word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What about you? Are you a worshshiper? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you a worshipper? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's let's understand this now. Being a worshipper doesn't mean &gt;&gt; amen. Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; I know some of us think that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which that's fine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But look, there was a woman in the Bible, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; who only had a little bit of oil &gt;&gt; and a little bit of meal. &gt;&gt; And God came and told her, &gt;&gt; "Hey, &gt;&gt; I want you to feed my servant." &gt;&gt; It's like, "This all I got." But church, look, God working on both ends. &gt;&gt; God tells that prophet, hallelujah, I want you to go to this little woman and she'll sustain thee. And when he got there, she only had enough for just her, just her and her son. God say he was going to sustain you. That's when it's time to worship. &gt;&gt; When it look like there's not enough. When it look like, hallelujah, it shouldn't be. That's the time you have to say, "God, I know you can't supply." That is correct. &gt;&gt; The pro the prophet worship the the the lady worship and both of them were taken care of. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. What do you do in your time of lack? &gt;&gt; Well, church, when I when I think about it, hallelujah. Of of of of really being a worshipper, &gt;&gt; you know, I began to realize that it's not connected to sound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a mean. We appreciate the instruments. We do. We appreciate the gifts in the body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your gift, Hallelujah, is given to you so that you may worship. Hallelujah. But when when when when I'm in my car, your gift ain't with me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sisters, when you when you doing the laundry or whatever, the piano may not be there. Hallelujah. So, how do you worship then? &gt;&gt; It has to be a revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It has to be a revelation. And in those times, can you give God words of affirmation? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; see, we use all these other things for a crutch, &gt;&gt; not to get out of our comfort zone. &gt;&gt; Right now, I guarantee you, if I start if I start marching around the church, y'all look at me like, "What? What? Why is he marching? What what's going I I don't feel nothing. What's going on? Why? Why is he marching? See, you're looking for a reason. &gt;&gt; I don't need no reason to give God praise. Hallelujah. He's just good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometimes I feel like running, so I run. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; That's how I express to him. &gt;&gt; Worship is an expression. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's more than just a sound. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Bless &gt;&gt; church. If we look and we going somewhere by the grace of God. Everybody all right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you know what? I have something special for those of you who are not quite ready to worship with me. Amen. I just got something that just a pull you along. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I got a couple from that side. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Huh? What does that say? &gt;&gt; Huh? What does that say? &gt;&gt; Now, that ain't the whole church. Some of y'all holding it back. Hallelujah. I bet if this say you haven't receive a million dollar, who wants it? &gt;&gt; I bet everybody will say me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we get to church, we hear the word of God, hallelujah, and we don't even let the worship of amen come out of our mouths. Do you agree with the word? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is God a healer? Is God a savior? Is God a deliverer? Is God here this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, I realize, you know, one of my friends in Canada, Hallelujah. He said, "Brother Diggs, you know, they French Canadian." He said, "Brothers, you know what? The reason why I like bringing you to my church, cuz you like a culture shock to my people." Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. They ain't used to seeing nobody running and screaming and hollering and sweating and hallelujah. Doing all these things while you preaching. &gt;&gt; What it is is people not used to seeing somebody that's free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Free. &gt;&gt; And let me say this. I wasn't hallelujah in a Pentecostal church and then came in the message. I wasn't in a Baptist church then came in the message. Hallelujah. What you see is a direct born and bred message believer. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's for that's for that's for you quiet nice Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm not trying to get you to be like me, &gt;&gt; but what I'm saying is God deserves to be praised. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did he wake you up this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Bible says in Psalms 150, "Let everything that have breath do what? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise ye the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I bet if we was at a Cardinals game, you'll give them some praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't try to act like you don't know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Go Kyla. Go, Kyler. Run. Run. Go, Kyler. &gt;&gt; Exactly. In there. &gt;&gt; I I I know. I know. &gt;&gt; I know. I can feel it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm a Cowboys fan. &gt;&gt; You weren't expecting that one, was you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. That brother said he likes football. I didn't say I was consumed by it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I didn't say I go and worship. Hallelujah. It's just a little entertainment. That's all it that's all it should be. Amen. It shouldn't be your God. It shouldn't be in the place of your God. It shouldn't take away from your God. Anything else that you put before God, you will worship it. &gt;&gt; You say that brother mentioned he he he like a football game just like you like to go hunting. Some of you got about 10 guns. &gt;&gt; Everyone for different occasions. Stay out there two weeks. Somebody you in a cabin. I'm I'm going to leave you alone. I'm going to leave you alone. &gt;&gt; Or just leave me alone watching my football highlights. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Is it true? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look, worship is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; And I can't make myself worship exactly like you worship. &gt;&gt; It has to be what God has revealed. &gt;&gt; Well, look church, I started to think about this and the prophet uh he made the statement. He said, "When God dwells alone, holy, his laws, his righteousness makes him holy." He wanted to be in man. Hallelujah. He wanted to be in man. &gt;&gt; He wanted to worship with him. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Think about that, church. &gt;&gt; Look, &gt;&gt; don't let the natural illustrations I'm giving you throw you off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe in holiness. I believe in living for God and concentrating in prayer. Amen. And spending time with God. &gt;&gt; I give these natural examples so that we can realize, yes, we are sane Christians. &gt;&gt; We're not fanatics. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have things outside of just coming to church that we deal with. But even in that, it should identify that you are a Christian. &gt;&gt; Excellent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's good. See, most most people get up behind and and they and they won't they they won't be honest. They won't tell you all these different things that they are involved in. Cuz we know our prophet, he loved to hunt. Amen. He loved to have a good time. He loved to tell jokes, but he was still a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He would always speak and say, "That's you got to watch the human side." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But look, church, but what we do too often, we want to make one another spiritual robots. &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me let me move on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody all right? &gt;&gt; He said he want to worship with man. He wanted man Hallelujah. to worship him. Amen. We were created to do what? Worship God. &gt;&gt; To give him praise. &gt;&gt; Words of affirmation. how great thou are. &gt;&gt; When was the last time you told God how great he is? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. &gt;&gt; Let me say this church this morning. I don't have no punchlines. I don't have some special scripture or special quote that you've never heard to make you say, "Wow, I've never heard that one before. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach according to your pull. &gt;&gt; You pull, I preach. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You pull, I preach. That's how this works. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can see I'm not a pullpit preacher. So if you pull, I'll catch the inspiration and say what you want me to say. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You pull, I preach. You quit pulling, I stop. Hallelujah. You resist, I sniff. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Come on. &gt;&gt; Because if you can't pull and give God praise, that mean there's a spirit there. &gt;&gt; There's something in your life stopping you from worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's something in your life more important than God. Yeah, you're here this morning, but do you want to be? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's no other place I'd rather be, Hallelujah. Then gather with saints of like precious faith worshiping the true and living God. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Think about it. What did the Bible says when we all get together? Hallelujah. On one mind, one accord, the same words of affirmation. The Bible says on that day when they all came together and they worshiped, they gave God praise and they gave him thanks, they got on one accord, what happened? The Holy Ghost came down. &gt;&gt; He's still the same God. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God say, "Hallelujah. If we meet those conditions and those requirements, God will do the same thing." &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; So if we create an atmosphere of affirmation where God hallelujah is exalted, &gt;&gt; where he's exalted &gt;&gt; above your hypertension. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Exalted above your diabetes. Hallelujah. Exalted above, hallelujah. Any other thing you're going through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Above your anxiety. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen, I ain't going to be long. Don't get nervous. I know some of y'all got a a builtin 45 minute clock &gt;&gt; built in. You know, it it's crazy to me. It's not crazy cuz I used to do it. People will come to church and set their digital watches &gt;&gt; to the time they thinking he ought to be finished &gt;&gt; and then won't put it on silent. Have that thing beeping loud. &gt;&gt; Preacher hear it but they don't care. &gt;&gt; That's right. We here, but we don't care. Oh my. I used to be one of those people. Amen. I sit in church. This is before I got the Holy Ghost. I sit in church, set my watch, especially on a week night, I set that thing to 9:00. He going to stop tonight. He going to hear his watch and start counting it down. See, like the man start preaching harder. Oh my church. Do we really want to see the Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; church. Don't receive this as a rebuke. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is who we are. We are worshippers. &gt;&gt; And we're the only ones who can do it in spirit and in truth. Hallelujah. Because we have a vindicated hallelujah voice of God come in this day and tell us how we should worship. Hallelujah. The revelation of it. Amen. And gave us spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; So there's no excuse for us not to see God in our services, &gt;&gt; in our homes, &gt;&gt; in our prayers, in our daily life. There's no excuse. That is true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; church. But I look and I'm thinking about words of affirmation and positive words concerning how we think about God. Hallelujah. But you know, I I I was reading in the Bible and I I began to think in those times of adversity and and different ones and you know, and I I looked at Jehoshaphat and Jehoshaphat was about to go in battle with Ammon and Seir and Moab and it was announced to him that they coming against his kingdom. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the first thing Jehoshaphat did was feared. Now, if we could just get the fear out the church this morning, &gt;&gt; what's holding you back from really giving God all of you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about just being able to come to church. I'm talking about a life of surrender. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, I'll be the first one to say there's nothing like it. Hallelujah. There's nothing like it when you know that you're leaning on God. No matter what the situation looks like, I'm leaning on God. And church, it gets so bad sometimes. I just be I be leaning on I be leaning all on God. &gt;&gt; I be leaning on him. It's almost like he want to say, "Please, man, I know. Just back up a little bit." I say, "No, God, I'm depending on you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many of us are really, really, really, really, really, really, really leaning on God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise his name. &gt;&gt; That means no matter what happens, &gt;&gt; it's God's will. &gt;&gt; No matter what happens, when you're really, really leaning on God, no matter how it turns out, it's God's will. &gt;&gt; Can we accept that? Look church. &gt;&gt; Joshua started the fear. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he went to God in prayer. Let's go to second 2 Chronicles &gt;&gt; 20. 2 Chronicles 20. Uh listen. Oh my. The Bible says verse three, 2 Chronicles 20 and3 the Bible says, "And Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the Lord." See, &gt;&gt; first thing he started to do, &gt;&gt; in a moment of fear, he said, "You know what? I can't stop this, but I know who can." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I uh uh I don't have the ability to change the situation, but I know who can. So the Bible says he went to seek the Lord and proclaim a fast throughout all Judah. He said, "Hey, everybody who got something to do with me and my house, y'all going to fast and worship." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Next verse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord. Even out of all the cities of Judah, they came to seek the Lord. Next verse it says, "And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court." Next verse, "and said, "Oh Lord, God of our fathers, first of all, I know you're real. &gt;&gt; My daddy worship you. My mama worship you. My pastor worship you. All the men of old, they worship you. Hallelujah." Why is this church built standing here? Because a man had an experience with God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was more than just him having fellowship, his family fellowshipping with a prophet. It was fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh Lord, God of our fathers." Now listen what he says to God. Art not thou God in heaven? &gt;&gt; Think about it, church. Look at how he's approaching God. Right &gt;&gt; now, this is in his prayer, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He's coming and he's saying, "Art not thou God in heaven?" What do you think God is going to say? All he can say is &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all he can say is yes. And then he says, "And rule is not thou over the kingdoms of the heathen." It doesn't matter what the devil is doing. God, you are in control. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, he says, "Lord, are not you the God of heaven and don't you rule the kingdoms of the he?" What is God is going to say? What can he say, church? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. All God can say is yes. And then he says, "And in thine hand, is there not power and might?" &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Does anybody serve that God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the God of our fathers. He controls the devil. And then he comes and caps it off and he says, "Is not their power and might in your hands?" &gt;&gt; What can God say? &gt;&gt; All he can say is yes. &gt;&gt; See, we whatever kind of language you speak this morning, &gt;&gt; it'll all come back to Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Power and might in a hand that none is able to withstand thee." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now you tell me. &gt;&gt; If you give somebody these kind of words of affirmation, what are they going to do? &gt;&gt; What is he going to do? If he's an all powerful, all knowing, allseeing God, what is he going to do when you lift him that high? &gt;&gt; Next verse. He wasn't done yet. He says, "Art not thou our God?" Now he's making it personal. He said, "Yeah, you're the God of my fathers. You control the heathens. You got power and might. Hallelujah. Nobody be able to withstand you. But Lord, I want to know, are not you my God?" &gt;&gt; Are not you my God? &gt;&gt; What do you think he's going to say? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Who did drive out the inhabitants of the land before? &gt;&gt; Let me say this this morning. The spirits you're fighting, God has already dealt with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The devil you fighting, God has already defeated. &gt;&gt; The sickness you're fighting, God is already defeated. The trouble in your mind, he's already defeated. The pains in your body, he's already defeated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's dealt with the inhabitants before. He said, "And gave it to the seed of &gt;&gt; we've already been blessed." &gt;&gt; Oh my. The seed of Abraham, my friend, forever. Next verse. Listen, church. He says, "And they dwell therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name's sake." Now you think about it. &gt;&gt; He got lifted up like that. God God was lifted up by Jehoshaphat in a moment of fear, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Then the Bible says God comes down. Hallelujah. Verse uh 15. Hallelujah. Give me verse 15. Hallelujah. Let's go to 16. No, no, no, no. Keep it right there. He says, "And he said, hearken ye." Now, this is the answer to the words of affirmation. &gt;&gt; You want to know how Jehoshaphat got this answer? Stroll back up to what we just read. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You want something from God? &gt;&gt; Give him some praise. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give him some words of affirmation, encouraging words. Oh, God, there's none like you in all the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Listen church. He says uh uh uh next next verse go back to uh 15. He said he said hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and thou king Jehoshaphat. Now God is talking. Woo. The verse before that it says that the spirit of the Lord came upon somebody in church. &gt;&gt; Go back to 14. Let's go back to 14. Hallelujah. Listen. It says, "Then upon Jihazel, the son of Zachariah, the son of Banayiah, the son of Giel, the son of uh Ma Methani, the Levite, the son of Aspa, came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation." Church, when we exalt God, he can't help but make his spirit come down. The thing is, will you be the one yielded enough &gt;&gt; that God can speak through? &gt;&gt; That God can use. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go back to 15. He said, "Thus said the Lord." Now, God is talking. Thus said the Lord unto you, "Be not afraid nor dismayed." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, there may be things we're going through this morning, certain situations we've been fighting for years, &gt;&gt; but I want to ask you a question. Have you given God praise yet? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Don't be dismayed. Don't be worried about Don't worry about it. It may look real true. May look like your kids ain't saved in the way of the world." All be not dismayed. Don't worry about it. You got scripture. The Bible says the promise is unto you &gt;&gt; and unto your children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. Don't be dismayed by the reason of the great multitude. For the battle is not yours but God's. &gt;&gt; He got that kind of answer because hallelujah Jehoshaphat and the whole kingdom lifted him up. Are not you God? Are not you my God? Are not you the God of heavens? Are not you the God of our fathers? Is there not power and might in your hand? Don't you control the heathens? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Then God comes and say, "Look, the battle is not yours. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take I'm going to take care of this. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Think about it, church. Sometimes all it takes is a amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God comes on the scene. just to agree. &gt;&gt; Church, think about it. Most of the times that the third pull move was because somebody said the right thing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Wood brothers, they're in the boat and they said, "Brother Brandom, we wish our Sunday school teacher could just see us now." And and then the prophet said, "The spirit of the Lord started to move over the trees." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Cuz they start to give God praise for the life that they're living now. had it right a couple of more people sitting in a house meeting. The prophet of God is talking about all the supernatural things and all she said was that ain't nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; Words of affirmation. Then God comes down and says, "Give her anything she wants right now." &gt;&gt; Just because she said amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What about us, church? &gt;&gt; God ain't changed. Is he still the same? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's go to the next verse. Listen. He says, "Tomorrow go ye down against them. Behold, they come by the cliff of seas." Now, God is going to show them exactly where the devil is. God can show you how to defeat your enemy. &gt;&gt; He said, "And ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of Jerel." Go ahead. Next verse. He says, now this is what I like. He says, "Ye shall not need to fight." &gt;&gt; I'm going show you where the enemy at. I'm going show you what they doing, but you ain't going to fight. &gt;&gt; Woo. I feel like having a praise break. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my glory. Woo. Think about it, church. Our God can show us what the devil is doing. Expose the devil. And then he'll say, "Don't worry about it. I got it." &gt;&gt; Don't worry about the devil. I got it. Hallelujah. He said, "Ye shall not need, you shall not need to fight in this battle. Set yourself stand still and see the salvation of the Lord." Hallelujah. With you, oh Judah, Jerusalem. Fear not. Be not dismayed. Tomorrow go against them. For the Lord will be with you. &gt;&gt; Church. In another place, go back and read in the scripture. He said, "Go to the battle, but I want you to worship." &gt;&gt; Now, we've come to church this morning with all kind of things going on in our life, but did you worship? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, we're in a we're in a season of blossom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time for us to stop being cold and starchy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's time for us to give God what he deserves. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm sure all of us can agree that God deserves the praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, at least half of the church can. Maybe maybe the rest of us can get y'all on board. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, you know, sometimes when I come to church, it don't matter who's singing, who doing what is between me and God. &gt;&gt; And you know, people in my church, they look at me and say, "What's wrong with brother D? He carrying on. He just He just It just acting terrible. But they know to leave me alone cuz it ain't something Hallelujah. new. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's been good to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Churches, I want you to understand right now, what you are experiencing is a fulfillment of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've been a full-time evangelist since 2009. Hallelujah. But when I first started preaching, maybe a year or two in to me ministering, I was doing a youth meeting. And hallelujah, I ain't got time to tell it all. But in that youth meeting, God gave a sister something to tell me. She said while I was preaching, she could see two of me. &gt;&gt; She saw one of me right here and one behind the pull pit. And she said, "This one would step into this one, and then I would speak." And then it was step back out. Hallelujah. She said the whole service that was going on speak stepping back out. She said she thought it was something wrong with her. So she left out of the church, went in the bathroom and started to pray. Say, "Lord, I don't know what's going on, but if I've done anything wrong, Lord, forgive me. What do you do when things happen you don't understand?" &gt;&gt; So she was in the bathroom and she said, "The Lord say, go back in. There's nothing wrong with you. I want you to tell my servant something." So she say she sat there and she said it was still going on. She said now God begin to bring back things that she studied in the message. He said to her now what you're watching Hallelujah is his theophony. Hallelujah. Oh my. What is a theophony? A theophony is a word body. So I want to ask you who's preaching to you this morning? And better yet who's receiving what I'm preaching? It has to be theophony to theophony. &gt;&gt; That's truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; church. She said, "Hey," she said, God began to bring back. She said, "Remember, God's saying, remember you study that that dimension is there. It's just a little faster for the eye. &gt;&gt; You can't see it with your natural eye, but God allowed her to tap into it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What if God wanted you to tap in this morning, &gt;&gt; church? and she tapped in and it was because God wanted to do something. And she said while she was there watching it, God was showing her the things she's read that that's that's the fourth dimension you're looking in. You're looking at his theophony given the word to preach the body and says, "Look, remember the prophet of God said in that fourth dimension, there are angels in this room." &gt;&gt; That is true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And church, if angel, I believe angels are in this room. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If angels are in this room, that mean God is in this room &gt;&gt; because angels were dispatched to give God praise. So God has to be in this room. Hallelujah. So she said, she watched that and God be to unveil all that to her. And the main thing was, hallelujah. After the service was over, God gave her some more words. So she wanted to tell one of the brothers say, "Hey, tell brother I got something, brother." God gave to me to tell brother Digs. I'mma tell you, you tell him. The brother said, "No, &gt;&gt; I'm not going to do it. God gave it to you. &gt;&gt; You gonna tell him. &gt;&gt; So she told her husband, husband, husband say no. God gave it to you. &gt;&gt; You going to tell him?" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We can't rely on the worship of somebody else. &gt;&gt; It has to be your offering to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; church. Listen. So I called a husband out of respect. He says, "Why you calling me? God didn't give it to me. He gave me a wife number say, "Huh? Call her. Talk to her." She said, "Well, she told me the part about the theophony." She said, "But that wasn't it." She said, "God told me to tell you that he's going to take your ministry in places you could only imagine and he's going to bless you." &gt;&gt; I was like, "Wow." hadn't really really never been out of South Carolina. Been to Florida, Georgia, a couple places like that. But the prophecy was he was going to take me in places I could only imagine. I never imagined myself being in Flagstaff, Arizona. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? I ain't got no reason to come here. &gt;&gt; The only reason I have to come here is to fellowship with the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, I'm the kind of person once I see it, that's good enough for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've been to the Grand Cane. Praise God. Okay. All right. I'm out. I mean, I'm not I'm not being negative. That's just me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, there has to be something greater. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the will of God. &gt;&gt; Church, look, we was in the we was in the Philippines last year around Christmas time and the brothers I was riding with asked me a question. Say, "Brother Diggs, have you been to all the continents?" I was like, "Uh, I don't know. I wasn't that good in geography." So they started naming them. Hallelujah. And I've been to all six. I know there are seven. I know somebody say I need that seven. And the only one I hadn't been to is Antarctica. And let me make this real clear. I have no desire to go. Hallelujah. But if there are saints in Antarctica that's a part of this prophecy, I will be there. Hallelujah. The last place that I had to go was Australia. Hallelujah. Why was I there? Not to see the kangaroos. I was there why? It was a fulfillment of prophecy. So I want to say to you saints in this area, in this church this morning, you are a fulfillment of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And there's a key element. Hallelujah. That for me, she said, "And the Lord said he's going to bless you." I hadn't worked a full-time job since 2009. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; But the Lord has been blessing. &gt;&gt; I could always use more. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Things get tough, things get hard, but God come through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, church, I'm going to tell you a personal testimony. Don't get nervous. I'm about to close. Amen. And I might say that four more times. I said I was about to. I didn't say I was. &gt;&gt; Well, church, look. Hallelujah. Before I started this uh full-time in the ministry, I was working at the city, the city of Columbia, and I was a a solid waste hydraulic engineer. When my daughters say that, they say, "Yeah, right. A garbage man. I drove a garbage truck. One of the ones that pick up from the side and dump it." Hallelujah. You know, I had to get out. You know, God gave me that job. It was perfect. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But, you know, I seen a guy about two years ago, maybe a year ago, that I used to work with, and we got to talk. He said, "Hey, Dre, how you doing?" I said, "I'm good, man." He said, "What you doing now?" I said, "I'm still preaching." I said, "You retired?" And he said, "Yeah, man. I'm retired." And just started smiling. Gave me old devilish grin. I'm retired. I said, "Man, that must be nice." You're like, "Yeah, man. I'm going to go home right now and sit on the couch." And you know, if you receive things in the wrong channel, it'll beat you up. &gt;&gt; He said that to me. I was like, "Oh, man." &gt;&gt; Soon as I walked away, the devil said, "See, you could have been retired in two years. You could have been retired. H next year would have been the year I retired." Hallelujah. And the devil saying, "See, you could have retired. You out here talking about you preaching, &gt;&gt; bills jacked up. You got debt all over the place. Hallelujah. Well, he wasn't saying hallelujah. I'm just saying it. But he's showing me everything negative &gt;&gt; about my choice of going fulltime in the ministry. &gt;&gt; Look at your car. Your car got 260,000 miles on it. Need a tuneup. You ain't got no money. Every time you get money in the bank, you have to spend it on something. If you would have stayed on that job, you have a 401k, you have a health plan, you have all this stuff. And it was true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was true. &gt;&gt; But what I love about God, &gt;&gt; he said, "Be not dismayed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, when the devil is talking to you, if you sit still and get quiet enough, God will come. &gt;&gt; He'll come with a word. And the Lord came, he started to talk to me. He said, "Yeah, that's true." He said, "But think about all the lives that will touch in the ministry. Think about all the supernatural things you've seen. Hallelujah. Think about the power of God that has sustained you and your family all the way to this day. You'd never be able to see how great God is. Think about God as a healer that healed you from cancer in your body. Healed you over and over and over again. Think about that. You would have never seen that if you wasn't obedient." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you know what I did in that moment? I raised my hands and I said, "Blessed be the name of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, don't receive what the enemy is saying. God's way is always the best way. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's how he fight. He fights me with finances. But hallelujah. I serve a God who owns a cattle in a thousand years. And you better believe it. I remind him every day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And better yet, I'm a tithe payer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says you bring to God's storehouse, you are what? You are blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we all we should do a jumping jack in here. If we ti pairs, we blessed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That don't mean you ain't going to have battles. You going to have struggles. Hallelujah. In church. Hallelujah. What I'm grateful about, most of my blessings come from the body. Hallelujah. I can go somewhere and preach, somebody walk up to me and say, "God told me to give you this." And I be like, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; He's just confirming to me that I'm in his will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, words of affirmation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to run this down real quick. Hallelujah. That's how Jehoshaphat got God to say, "The battle is not yours, but it's mine." What do you do in the midst? Listen, David was a man of war. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But David knew how to give God words of affirmation. &gt;&gt; Psalms 118 verse 6, the Bible says, "The Lord is on my side." Now, this is David. David said, "The Lord is on my side." He's in the middle of a battle. He said, "The Lord is on my side." He said, "I will not fear. What can man do unto me?" &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Boy, that's a revelation. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who cares about a government shutdown? The Lord is on my side. &gt;&gt; I will not fear. What can man do unto me? &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; We spend too much time worrying about Trump. &gt;&gt; I'mma settle this once and for all for everybody. Trump lovers and and not Trump lovers. Trump is in the hands of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So you say, I'm vote for this. I'm vote for that in the hands of God. &gt;&gt; Just like Obama was, just like Bush was, just like Reagan was, just like Roosevelt, Abraham, any one of them you want to name, they were in the hands of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord is on my side. &gt;&gt; Oh my. David also said in Psalm 27, hallelujah, he said, "The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life." Hallelujah. "Of whom shall I be afraid. If God is in control of our life, we have no reason to be afraid." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, there go my alarm. It's mine, brother. I know you thought it was yours. It's mine. Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; See, so y'all don't pour that at him. It's mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. &gt;&gt; I don't believe you have to preach for two hours. I don't believe you have to preach for 30 minutes to get the point across. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that once we receive the word, &gt;&gt; the rest is up to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David's words of affirmation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, look, it's all through the Bible. Remember, Hallelujah. Now, I've been preaching for an hour. Now, what I set my clock to, an hour. Can you believe it? We've been in the presence of God for an hour. It doesn't even seem like that. &gt;&gt; For those of us who are in tune, &gt;&gt; the chicken, it ain't going away. The turkey or the fish or whatever you got on the stove, it ain't going no way. It'll be right there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who knows? Hallelujah. How long it'll be before I come back? &gt;&gt; So, shouldn't I be able to enjoy y'all? &gt;&gt; Y'all going to let me enjoy myself? &gt;&gt; Brother, please. Come on. It's time to quit. But look, church, all through the Bible, remember God told the children of Israel that I've given you the land. Hallelujah. But they came up against a lot of things. And you know what they said? If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land and give it us in the land which flow with milk and honey. They said in Numbers 13, everybody started complaining about the giants they saw and all these things. Caleb said, the Bible says, "Then Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What are you waiting on? Take a step of faith and believe God. Believe God to be what you need him to be this morning. If he delight in us, let us go up at once. &gt;&gt; Words of affirmation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I could go on and on, but I'm going to close. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Paul, he says, "And we know." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we know &gt;&gt; that all things work together &gt;&gt; for good. &gt;&gt; Amen. to those that love God and called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; We know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, and one of my favorite Job lost everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which it was just a a a bet between God and the devil. &gt;&gt; That's all the trial was a bet between God and the devil. &gt;&gt; But Job going through the midst of it, &gt;&gt; his friends, his message believing friends turned their back on him. Look, and they didn't even have any evidence. &gt;&gt; All they had was what they saw. &gt;&gt; They couldn't prove he did anything wrong. They just wanted to smear his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my Oh my church. And Job said, "Hey." They say, "Job, how long you go?" Hold on. Job said, "Hey, the Lord God giveth and the Lord God taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." Woo! going through all that adversity, he was still able to give God words of affirmation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And I'll end. Remember, come remember there was a man in the Bible named Lazarus and Lazarus was dying and the sister sent a message to Jesus. And the message got to Jesus. Jesus said, "Okay." and kept on going where he was going. Hallelujah. They sent another message say Lazarus is dead. Jesus say this could be for the glory of God. You know I'm paraphrasing the scripture. You go back and read it. John 11. But what I love when Jesus finally made it. Hallelujah. He didn't make it to an angry family. He made it to a people who knew who he was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you look at the approach Hallelujah. of the family when Jesus came. When Jesus came, the Bible says that Mary stood at his feet. Hallelujah. Mary, hallelujah, she chose that part. Hallelujah. But remember when he came, mother said, "Hey, Lord, if you would have been here, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died." words of affirmation. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "Hey, &gt;&gt; your brother arise again," she give him more words of affirmation. Lord, I know &gt;&gt; in the day of the resurrection, &gt;&gt; but let's back up a little bit. When she before she got to the resurrection, she said, "Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died. But even now, &gt;&gt; not tomorrow, not next week, not the next time. Brother D's come back. Lord, even now. &gt;&gt; If you ask God anything, he'll do it. Even now. Right now. Now, what do you think Jesus is doing while she talking to him like that? &gt;&gt; The anointing is probably flowing all over him because he know what she gonna say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now, church. Hallelujah. Jesus said, "Your brother going to rise again." He says, she says, "Lord, I know in the day of the resurrection." She was a believer. Think about it, church. &gt;&gt; Christ hadn't even died yet. But that was his testimony. His testimony was he told the believers, "In three days, I'mma die in three days. I'mma rise." He had told the believers that. Hallelujah. And Martha heard it and she believed it. She wasn't waiting on it to happen. She said, "Lord, I know he'll rise again in the day of the resurrection." Jesus said, "I am the resurrection." Praise the glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God is moving, let's not fall back into our unbelief. Now she's giving him all those words of affirmation. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Where have you laid him?" She said, "Lord, by now he's thinking, you just said if you ask God, he can do anything &gt;&gt; and now you worried about how it smell." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, Jesus told them, "Roll the stone away." Mary and Martha, this is a family affair. &gt;&gt; They roll the storm away. I believe when the stank came out, it didn't even go to Jesus' nose cuz he was God. He controlled death. Hallelujah. And he stood there because Martha put him in position. He stood there and he called Lazarus by name. And we know the prophet of God say he had to do that because if he didn't, everybody would have rose. &gt;&gt; He's still the same God. He's still the same God this morning and he can fulfill your need this morning if you will just give him praise. Let's pray. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I know some of y'all waiting on me to pray, but I don't know what you need. God does. So, why don't you talk to God? Why don't you put God in position with your words of affirmation? Hallelujah. Oh my Lord. We thank you, Father, and we bless your holy name. Lord, we pray right now, Lord, you'd come on the scene and you move in a way, Lord, that only you can. If we would do it like Jehoshaphat, we would say, "You are the God of our fathers, Lord." And we're standing on their shoulders this morning, Lord. Lord, you are the God of the heavens. You are the God that control the works of the heathens. and you have all power and might in your hand. And Lord, if Jehoshaphat can pray that prayer and get results, you're still the same God. We can pray the exact same prayer &gt;&gt; and should be able to get results. There are many battles going on, Lord. And we would so desire to hear from you that the battle is not ours. The battle is not mine, but it's yours, Lord. Lord, have your way in our lives, Lord. Forgive us for our sins. Forgive us of any form of unbelief that may be lingering in the room, Lord. Show yourself mighty. Show yourself strong in this place. Like David said, there is none like you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is on my side. Lord, I thank you. We give you praise, Lord. And let deliverances come out of the service this morning. Lord, let us speak those things that are not as though they are right now because we're Abraham's seed. Hallelujah. Lord, let our faith step out into the realm to grab hold of what we stand in need of. Whether it be something natural in our bodies, Lord, a peace of mind or maybe a financial blessing, whatever it is, Lord, you said through a prophet, everything we need, we have for the journey. All we have to do is lift you up, Lord. We praise you and we bless you. We give you all the honor and all the glory. In the wonderful name of Jesus Christ, we pray. This church, say, "Amen." Let's give her some praise. You want to sing that? Sing that. Amen. How great, how great. Everybody say Heat. Heat. How great is our God? Yeah. Heat. Hey, Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. Heat up here. Yeah. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. Heat up here. Heat. Heat. Oh, you just praise and worship him in your own way if you need to go. But if you need something from him, put him in his position. I love that. Exalt him. Tell him what you need. Oh, I go back to that scripture I read earlier in the week and Peter was down in the dumps and just denied him three times. Jesus shows up on the screen and actually this Peter said, "I'm just going to go fishing. I I'm just going to go fishing. I'm go back to the world. I'm going to go back to what I was doing before you came." Jesus told him, "Do you love me, Peter?" "Yeah, I love you." "No." "Do you love me, Peter?" "Yeah, I love you." And a third time, "Do you love me, Peter?" "Yeah, I love you, Lord." If you love him this morning, just lift your hands and tell him, "I love you, Lord." I'm not a singer, but I could tell him I love him. Oh, just raise your hands and tell him you love him. Exalt him this morning. Put him in his position. Oh, thank you, heavenly father. Lord, you've been so good to me, Lord. So good. I want to give you praise of affirmation this morning. Heavenly Father Lord, I want to tell you, you're my everything. I want to tell you that you're in charge of my life. I want to be dependent except you become like a little child. Absolutely dependent on him this morning. Oh, I exalt thee. Oh Lord, I exalt thee. Oh heavenly father, I love you. I love you and I exalt thee. Heavenly Father, Lord, &gt;&gt; I'll put it all in your hands. If you have anything you're hanging on to this morning, give it to him. He'll take care of it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, heavenly father. Lord, we love you and appreciate you and just love each and every one of you. Amen. to worship. Here I am to bow down.

Oh, heavenly father, what a new meaning to worship. Oh, heavenly father, Lord, I thank you for your words that were spoken this morning. Heavenly Father, Lord, I just ask that you would put that in the people's hearts, Lord. That they would take that spirit of worship with them, Lord, in their cars, at their dinner table, Lord, in their beds. Heavenly Father, Lord, that those would be the last words that we speak, Lord, any moment. Lord, I just thank you. I love you. Appreciate you. Just ask that you'd go with the people, Lord. be with our brother Digs, Lord, as you poured out his heart to us this morning, heavenly father, Lord, and just ask that you'd bless him and his family, Lord.
