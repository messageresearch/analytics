[music] [music] Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Let's [music] stand. He is Lord. [singing] [music] He is Lord. [singing and music] He [music and singing] has risen from the dead. And he [music and singing] Every [music and singing] time that [music and singing] Jesus Christ is Lord. [music] [singing] Amen. Amen. We greet you in the precious holy name [music] of the Lord Jesus Christ. And um would the people be all right if I read something? The pro the prophet said little story that sort of tells us where we're at. Cammy, I'd like to sing or have you till the storm passes over. As I'm just reading this little portion [music] before we turn it over and I'll turn it over to Until the Storm Passes over, Brother Brandham says it reminds me of a chaplain one time coming out of the army. He said he he said, "Brother Brandham," it was right after the first world war. He said the chaplain said, "Sergeant, come by." And said, "Chaplain, you want to ride out to the battlefront with me on the Argon out there, Lassel, Lorine, France, you know." And I and said, "I went out towards the Argon forest." And he said he was taking number of so many tanks had been blowed up. And he said it was an Easter morning. Said, "I just got through. I walked through with a nurse and she was giving those wounded boys an American rose. You know one American used to uh American rose, you know, one and American used to. Them boys grab the rose and just scream and cry because they know it come from home. See, it's from home. And that's the way I think we do with the word. See, we grab it. Oh, God, it comes from home. See? Said I was feeling pretty up in my heart. And he said, "I went out there and said the Lord went out and to take a number of how many tanks and [music] destroyed and things like that." Said the Holy Spirit said, "Go over to that little rock." And he looked around and said, "They throwed that mustard and chlorine gas." And said, "Just burn all the leaves of the trees. There wasn't a living [music] thing left." And here was Easter. He said, "What an Easter! What an Easter." When not even grass on the ground, not nothing. and he said something attracted me to a [music] rock. He pulled the rock over and said there was a little Easter flower under it. It'd been kept under the rock all through the poison gas and said, "I thought, oh God, keep me under the rock of ages till all this poison is passed [music] and leave me bloom in that land forever." Amen. And I thought it just sort of told where I we were at this morning. came in till the storm pass is over till [music] you wonder [singing] forever. [singing] Let me [music] stand in the hall [singing] of your hand. Keep [music] me [singing] safe till the stores. [music] &gt;&gt; Just sometimes you feel like the storm's there and you're just praying, Lord, let it pass by. Maybe this morning you've got a storm coming by. He can move it on. Uh we have some prayer requests uh that were left over from Wednesday. I just thought they play over to our week ahead of us. Want to remember brother Glenn and Sister Karen. They're traveling or have already gone to Shreport, Louisiana. Sister Karen had had a persistent cough. Want to remember her. Also, Brother Steve, brother Isaac, brother Carlos, brother Marcelo down in Peru. And then they will also be traveling home on Wednesday. And Sister Danette and her the Flagstaff remnants of the family will be traveling on Wednesday. So, we want to remember them. Anybody else have a request or if you're going to be traveling? Also, sister Pauline, things well with your sister-in-law. We'd had a request for her sister-in-law, Misty, lost her daddy and uh her mama had had surgery. So sometimes it just compounds and compounds. So we want to remember Sister Pauline's family. If we could bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we thank you this morning, Lord. We thank you for the snow. We thank you [music] for the rain. We ask you to protect and shield us, Lord, what it [music] does to the roads. And with all the people traveling, Lord, and saints [music] are going to be traveling for the Thanksgiving holiday. Lord, keep them safe. Protect them from those that aren't paying attention. [music] Lord, we pray for our brother Glenn and Sister Karen. Lord, for sister Pauline's family, [music] and for our pastor, Lord. He's out in the mission field with brother Isaac, Brother Carlos, Brother Marcelo. Lord, bless them, Lord. [music] And bless the people in the doors that they're able to walk through, Lord. The [music] places that they're able to go and share the word, Lord. Might they [music] lift you up. Bless them, Lord. Might they see your mighty hand. Lord, we have come [music] into this house this morning to worship you. We pray Lord that you would look down on your saints, Lord, [music] on our babies. Lord, look down on our musicians and our song leader this morning. [music] Might we fully enter in to praise and worship. Lord, might each feel the privilege of being able to [music] take part in worshiping you, Lord, and to be able to stand up, Lord, and gird ourselves, Lord, to be ready to [music] pull on the minister of the word this morning, Lord. Bless your children. Might you be lifted up. Might you be pleased with us, [music] Lord, as your angels move up and down the aisles? We pray pray this morning in Jesus [music] Christ's name. Amen. If you want to take your Bibles as [music] we remain standing, turn to Psalm 29 for our responsive reading this morning. I I don't always have these thoughts, but I just had a thought there in the back room. What a privilege that we can read this together. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God's children and we can take from his word and, you know, I thought we're just reading it back to him. He knows what it says. But if you could put your heart in these words and make it personal as we share in this. Give unto the Lord, oh ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength. The voice of the Lord is upon the waters. The God of glory thunderth. The Lord is upon many waters. &gt;&gt; The voice of the Lord is powerful. &gt;&gt; The voice of the Lord is full of majesty. &gt;&gt; The voice of the Lord breakth the cedars. Yay, the Lord breakth the cedars of Lebanon. &gt;&gt; The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire. The voice of the Lord maketh the hines to calf, and discoverth the forests, and in his temple doth everyone speak of his glory. &gt;&gt; Together, the Lord will give strength unto his people. The Lord will bless his people with peace. Amen. Amen. Greet the one next to you and you may be seated. Amen. Amen. Tom bless you musicians. Thank you. Bless you all. Dad, you'll forgive me. Where's mama? &gt;&gt; Okay, that's all I need to know. That's But you look out back there and forgive me for being a little bit personal, but she's my mama. [laughter] Yeah. So, amen. Amen. Because he lives I can face tomorrow. I'm happy in the Lord. I uh I wrote down brother Tom then felt like he made they feel the privilege and I thought you know what that's the truth. I wish I could understand even greater. I look out and taken [music] a few moments and had the opportunity to talk to people the last couple weeks that are [music] going through some terrible things in their life. Some hard things. I look out to you that have gone through some hard things in life. I haven't been called to face some of those things, brother Jerry. So I sit and I think, Lord, I don't ask for those things. What I ask for is to be able to praise you in whatever you give me. And that's what I'm seeing these people do. I don't want us to think that young people, do not ever think that God is only within these confines [music] of these four walls or within the people that sit here. God is throughout the world and he's showing himself mighty in battle. And so because he lives, we each one can face tomorrow. So we'll sing this little chorus with me just uh because he lives I love him. Amen. Yes, Lord. Because [singing] [music] I can praise [singing] you [music] because [singing] [music] I know [singing] I know Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [singing and music] Yeah. Heat. [music and singing] Yeah.

It's a little bit Until then, my heart can sing. Amen. Amen. That's part of the lesson, God, is when I listen to these people that are going through things and I listen [music] to tape and this uh is one of the things that strikes me and that the Holy Spirit reminds me that uh until then, I don't understand what each one is going through. I don't understand, Sister Heidi, why you needed to go through this trial twice. I don't understand if he's going to have you go through it again. That's not [music] what I'm here to do. I don't understand what my dad is. He has He's 82. This is my thinking. So, I I want you to understand and yet I don't understand why his body's breaking down. I'm sorry. I'm just human, you know, cuz my dad has always been that way to me. But it happens, Brother Gerald. We don't understand why Sister Alberta's in the place that she's at. But it's for God's glory and honor. I don't understand that. But until then, I'll go on singing, Bella. And no matter what, my heart sings because he's in control. That's all I know. And if I keep it that simple, then he'll work everything else. All right. So, amen. My heart can sing when I pause to remember. Huh, brother Matt? Where'd he go?

I'm I'm a new creation. Amen. You know, I uh thank the Lord. You people have understood that uh I am who I am. And sometimes I don't know why I ask what I ask, but I ask because it's down in my heart. Now then, I'm going to ask, Uncle Bob, you wouldn't have a song, would you? You and Dad used to sing. I know he doesn't have the breath anymore, but you know what? I am one of those ones that believes that a joyful noise is made just that. Breath or no breath? I don't know. Would you guys have a song that you would want to sing? Yeah. You don't know? Well, think about it. You have one to suggest and you don't want to sing it.

So, at this time, we're going to uh this is not live, but this is recorded. So, we'll greet the people and then ask brother Tom to introduce brother Ryan. Amen. God bless you, brothers and sisters. Uh we just wanted to greet you this morning from Lima, Peru. Tell you how wonderful of a time we've been having. The first week we we had a wonderful time of rest and visited some believers in Cusco and and took some time there. Uh but the last week we've had um it's been a little tough on the old body, but it's been miraculous and worth every difficulty that we've been through. And uh we had three baptisms in a very remote part of Peru. And today we're back in Lima and and ministering to a body here. And uh just God has been fantastic. What can you say? He's been wonderful. Um &gt;&gt; Tuesday we'll be uploading a video to the the website for the service on Wednesday. It's a a message from brother Ed Bisll from a few years back. One of the last messages that our brother ministered and it's a very powerful message called the value of a flaw. It's very powerful &gt;&gt; and uh so we'll be uploading that since there's no service on Wednesday. U please pray for our traveling mercies. We'll be traveling back on Wednesday and Lord willing we'll see you next Sunday. Um this morning just wanted to introduce brother Ryan and we ask for your prayers here in Lima as well that the Lord would help us get out of the way and they're in Flagstaff. May may God use our brother in a powerful way to minister on a very important topic that we've asked him to minister on. It's really uh an answer to how we should be as Christians, a body of believers looking uh you know for growth spiritually in many areas. and and may God help us always to grow. And um so pray for our brother and may God use him there in Flagstaff in a mighty way as he comes to speak to you this morning. Praise the Lord. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I didn't expect that introduction, but it was good to hear from our pastor this morning. Let's uh sorry you were going to get up, but I feel like it would relax me a little bit if we not that I can sing, but if we could sing a song. Um, anybody have one on your heart this morning? Something you really want to have sung this morning? I just uh think it'd be good to just think about the Lord as we praise anybody, one of the little ones. Oh, Sister Kathleen. Sorry, Brother Don. She beat you. &gt;&gt; Oh, he was just praising the Lord. All right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed assurance. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; See, probably Jesus [singing] is mine. [music] Oh, what a foreast [singing] [music] of glory divine [singing] [music] hair of sales [music] [singing] of God. [music] Lord [singing] of his washing [music] his blood. This is my soul. [singing] [music] This is [singing] my song. Praising [music and singing] my savior all [singing] day long. [music] This [singing] is my soul. This [singing] is [music] my song. Praising [singing] my savior [music] all the day long. Verse three. [music] Perfect [singing] sal is at rest. [music] I am [music and singing] myior [music] watching [singing] and w looking above [singing] [music] filled with his goodness. Lost in his love. [bell] [music] This [singing] is my story. [music] This [singing] is my song. Praising [music] [singing] my savior [music] all [singing] day long. Oh, this is my song. [music] [singing] This is my song. [music] Praising [singing] my savior all the day long. Amen. And as they just play that, let's just bow our heads and approach the Lord this morning. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just appreciate you so much, Lord. And Lord, we feel your presence, [music] Lord, and inhabiting our praises this morning, Lord. But Lord, all this is it's good, Lord. And the Bible is good, Lord. The message is good. The church is good. The gathering is good. The worship is good, Lord, but it's meaningless if you're not in it, Lord. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; And so we would ask more than just a time spent together with each other. Though we appreciate it, Lord, that we would be able to spend some time with you this morning, Lord. And that you would come, Lord, and just open up, Lord. Even just a word from you, Lord, would just do us so much good, Lord. I I I know it would bring joy to my heart. I I pray that everybody here feels the same, Lord. that just a word, Lord, fitly spoken, Lord, from you, Father. We just do us so much good in this time, Lord, in this dark age, Father. But we believe that there you have a light, Lord, at this time, Father, and that you will show it to those who are looking for it this morning, Father. And Lord, and if we've come with our issues and our complexes and our thoughts of [snorts] yesterday and maybe this afternoon and maybe this morning, Lord, I' I'd ask that you just help us all to set those aside, Lord, and just to make time for you this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; And just make room for a word this morning from you, Lord. We we ask it all in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord. May all glory be to you, Lord. May all honor be to you, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. Let's read a scripture and then we'll let you be seated this morning. Thank you musicians. Thank you, Sister Kathleen, for that song. It's just a It's been a while since we sang that one. Such a good song. I don't know why I forget to sing that one that often, but man, what how many is that? How many is that your story? &gt;&gt; It's not a story of ease. It's not a story of uh being battlef free and trouble free, but he delivers us out of everything. Amen. And that's my story that I want to sing to him. I want to praise to him this morning. And let's just go to Colossians if we could. And um [clears throat] I just want to maybe jump around this um this first chapter of Colossians. Uh I'll just read a a verse or two and then you can be seated and then we'll just uh kind of relax this morning. Maybe easier said than done, but Colossians chapter 1. Um, [clears throat] let's just read verse. We could really read this whole chapter. It's just a great chapter from beginning to end. And it's really hard to kind of pick out um, you know, a couple verses, but we'll start with verse 15. Speaking of Jesus Christ here, he says, "Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature? For by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created by him and for him. And he is before all things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many things? All right. Just making sure we're all awake this morning. He's before all things. And by him, how many things? &gt;&gt; All things consist. You may be seated. I'm just going to continue reading this. He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. How many things? Oh, &gt;&gt; I I don't mean to treat you like the little Sunday school, but you know, sometimes we just, and I was thinking about this a few weeks ago, and I spoke somewhere else. I said, sometimes we just need to be like a Sunday school class and really just, you know, sometimes I get so high in my knowledge and high in my revelation and high in my my status or so-called, I think, with God that I forget what it's like to be a little child and just and just say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And just say, you know what? Jesus does love me. You know, sometimes I forget about those little Sunday school lessons. Can we just get down to a Sunday school lesson this morning? Would that be okay? And uh you know, maybe maybe we could say, "I don't agree with what was said." But we certainly shouldn't be able to say, "I didn't understand what was said." Amen. I know that's kind of hard, but you know, sometimes I just I just like it laid out just plainly. And I've I've been rejoicing personally in the Lord for the last few weeks and months, just the messages that we've heard. Um, you know, it's just funny how you can have ministers from all over the United States come in and just preach exactly all in that same channel of each other, not knowing what the other person's speaking about, and then uh and then our pastor getting up a few weeks ago and it just just was so good for me. And I'm just kind of giving you a little testimony this morning so I can relax a little bit. And um I uh it's good to see everybody in the house of the Lord this morning. I was really really praying hard last night that we got a snowstorm and somebody was praying harder than me that it would just be rain I think because I was I saw the weather report and I was like man if it drops 5 degrees I I'm off I'm off the hook and uh I woke up and I was uh I was a little sad but uh but it's good to be in the house of the Lord and I do appreciate I do I do appreciate that when you come out to the battle &gt;&gt; now maybe this shouldn't be a battle. This should be where we get rejuvenated and it is. But when I come out and and and you want to you want to be able to look to your left and look to your right and see somebody that's got your back and somebody that's got your side. I don't know how you feel, but when you know I feel good when I see the pews filled with people that I love and that I know that if I'm going to be attacked from this side, they got my back. And you know what? I got your side from this back. So don't think don't think that your presence in church means nothing. &gt;&gt; It does mean something. It means something to someone even if they never tell you about it and you're like, "I'm just an insignificant. I just come every once in a while and I sit in this pew." It means something to someone to look over and see you sitting right there. It strengthens me and I hope it strengthens you to look over and see somebody, especially somebody who's going through some battles and they still come into church. Sometimes they're wounded. Sometimes they're limping. Sometimes they're missing a hand or missing an arm because of what they're going through in the week. But yet they still find the strength to come to church. I find that encouraging as much as any message that's preached, as much as any song that's sang, songs are good and and scriptures are good, but when I see it come to life and my brothers and sisters, that encourages me more than anything. Amen. I hope you that you feel the same. And let's just, you know, brother brother Steve had asked me, he's never ever really asked me to to speak on a subject. And even when he asked me about this one, he he gave me a lot of liberty. He said, 'Look, I just I thought maybe I'd asked you to talk about a certain thing. He goes, "But if you feel led to go in a different direction, hey, don't be constrained. Don't feel like you have to." Um, and I appreciated that he's never he's never really directed what I had to say, which I I I just thank the Lord for How many is grateful for our pastor this morning. &gt;&gt; And it's just good to see that he's working. You know, when he doesn't get a vacation when he leaves here, um, probably preaching two or three times a week at least. Brother Jerry, probably more than that, right? It's not it's not an easy thing over there. So, let's keep him in our prayers. But he had asked me to um just think about talking about a certain subject that was requested um by somebody here in the church or maybe by a few people in the church. And that is the uh the the the the sign that we have on in the foyer that says a word to the church. And and if you're not familiar with it, would it be all right if we just took about two three four minutes and I just read that for you? Would that be all right? And you know, I've read it a bunch of times and then brother Steve sent me um a recording of when brother Brandham actually preached it and man, it was just like I was like I hear I heard it for the first time. Would it be okay if I read that? &gt;&gt; Okay. And it says uh it's out of Christ the mystery of God revealed. And this is how it starts. It says love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Above everything. So now you know maybe why I was accentuating all things in that scripture, right? So love one another above &gt;&gt; all &gt;&gt; everything all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like the first sentence is already &gt;&gt; uh you know for me kind of uh sometimes a rebuke, &gt;&gt; you know, in a good way because I'm a child of God. So sometimes he takes the he takes the belt a little bit and goes, "Okay, sentence number one. Are you doing this?" Uh, well, I thought I was right until you asked me that, Lord. And then I realized how many things I do put in front of the love that I have for somebody else. And most of the time, the the thing that I put in front of love one another is the love for me, &gt;&gt; right? Nobody's nobody's going to say, "I really love myself." But when I put my needs first and my wants first and my desires first, I'm not even doing the first sentence, let alone the whole rest of this paragraph. But let's continue. Love one another above everything. Says it again. Love one another. No matter what the devil tries to say, you're all one great big sweet group now. But remember my warning. See, Satan won't let that stay that way. No sir. He'll shoot everything. If he has to bring somebody in to make his target, he'll bringing some critic or unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it. Don't you take sides with it. &gt;&gt; I think if we just have some time this morning, maybe we'll break a few of these things down, but let's read through it. Don't you have nothing to do with anything else. you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another. Pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman or whoever it is. Just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor. See, he's the shepherd and you give him respects. He'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so. &gt;&gt; Now, you remember that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The congregation says, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; The enemy will come. &gt;&gt; Yes. True. Amen. &gt;&gt; The enemy will come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy, I I this is my favorite sentence maybe in this whole thing. The one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Don't ever clan amongst one or talk make yourselves clanish. We are one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I couldn't say left hand, I'm mad at you. I'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand. He's my left hand. I want him to stay there. Even the little tip of my finger, I want to stay right there. Every little part of my body stay right there. This ought to just get rid of the complexes that we have that I'm so insignificant to the church. It wouldn't matter if I didn't live here. You know, if you didn't have this little cuticle on your hand, that little cuticle, you know how much pain you would be in when a little infection gets inside? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm just nothing, brother. I I don't do anything to church. I I sometime without the little cuticle on my finger. My whole body would be in pain. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Sometimes we just let the devil say, "You're insignificant in church. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's because I'm young. Oh, it's because I'm too young. I'm too old. I'm too this. I'm too that. He comes in. See, the enemy will come. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is how he This is how he comes in. I I just want to go through this. I I kind of stopped, but I just I feel I feel that that that that little that little tug and that little uncction when somebody's like, "Well, this applies to those who are an important part of the body." BUT IF ONE LITTLE PART OF THE BODY HURTS, the whole body should hurt. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's just get rid of the complexes that the devil I'm telling you that it's the devil who's whispering to your mind and to your heart that you do not matter. &gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT. &gt;&gt; THAT IT WOULDN'T MATTER IF YOU SHOWED up or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you if you choose to listen to that, you're letting the enemy come in and break up what God is trying to put together. &gt;&gt; You've got tapes on that. He says, "Oh, sorry. Uh the tip of my finger. I want to stay right there. God wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another. Right with one another. Now, you've got tapes on that. You've got tapes on what we believe. You got tapes on discipline in the church. How we behave oursel in the church. How we got to come together here and sit together in heavenly places. Don't stay home. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for those doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers. If you don't feel that way, then I tell you it's time to go to praying. If the if coming to church, if you wake up and uh and it it's not just we're not we're not just want to talk about a this isn't the problem. It's a symptom of a problem is what he's trying to say. He's saying that that's a symptom of you know we talk about we talk about makeup and high heels and cutting your hair and pants and language and attendance in church and all these things. They're not the problem. They're a symptom of a problem. And that's what he's saying. Go to praying. If my battle is when I wake up in the morning, do I h do I feel like going to church or not? Do I really want to go? I'm fighting the wrong battle. &gt;&gt; If that's the battle, the enemy has already slipped in. &gt;&gt; That is correct. &gt;&gt; And he's making the battle about something that's not the battle. &gt;&gt; That is correct. &gt;&gt; HE'S TRYING TO DISTRACT you from what the real battle is. &gt;&gt; And if I let him, you know, he'll just keep doing it. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; He'll just keep doing it. But if I that shouldn't be our battle this morning. But like he says, he gives you a solution. It's time you get to praying. We're in the last days where the Bible exalt or exhorted us much more as we see that day approaching to love one another. I apologize to kind of hurry through this, but um yeah, I forgot to set a timer. I'm going to I like to have something up here uh to ignore. So, let me &gt;&gt; I'm going to take u I'll take a few minutes off of that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to his name. &gt;&gt; Are we all right this morning? Did you come to act? Did you come to have church? &gt;&gt; We drove through the rain. We drove through bad roads. Let's not just come here and just, well, okay, that was really good and forget about it. Let's have a meal this morning. &gt;&gt; Let's have a meal this morning. Amen. We're in the last days when the Bible exhorted us much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus to love one another. This will all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for the other. That's right. Just stay right together. Each one of these paragraphs is a whole message. So you forgive me to to kind of rush through this. We could just take a year to break down this parag this whole thing. If the brother and you think he's a little wrong or the sister we've never done that, right? should be. Yeah, exactly. I've done it like like recently. &gt;&gt; Not like when I was Oh, yeah. I used to do that, brother way long ago. No. Have you ever thought a brother or sister was a little wrong? &gt;&gt; Okay. Lord, don't ever let me have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the CHRIST OUT OF MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; GOD, help us. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; He didn't even say that the brother and sister weren't wrong. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He said if you start to think this way about them, &gt;&gt; guess what happened? The enemy has gotten in and then it will take the Christ out of your life. The poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you. It will run him from the tabernacle. It will kill the spirit of God &gt;&gt; or drive it away from here. It'll hurt your pastor. It'll do everything. See, don't do that. You just wax that much closer together. Draw. Take the buckle. As a brother testified, a minister here the other night about having a buckle, seeing it in a vision that buckles up the whole armor of God. Just pull her on. Tighten up. [snorts] &gt;&gt; As the young people would say today, it's time to lock in, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's time to lock in. Buckle up. Tighten up the armor. I'm talking to myself this morning. it starts to get a little bit loose as we go through some battles. It's time to cinch it back down. &gt;&gt; Tighten up. Move right up close to one another. Love one another anyhow. Talk nice about one another. Say nice things about one another. You just think it's repetitive. &gt;&gt; It's a it's a it's direction. &gt;&gt; It's order. &gt;&gt; And then God will bless you. &gt;&gt; Now, he goes on, he prays, but I think that's where it actually ends there on that poster. So, um, thank you for bearing with us as we read that. And I just want to, you know, we don't have time to preach on this whole thing. I certainly don't even have the ability to speak on this whole thing, but just some of the things that jumped out to me. Would it be okay if we just go through those this morning? And um, you know, even if you said no, we're probably still going to go through those things. But, so I pray you just, you know, it's like brother Dick said last week, you know, um, the minister up here, if they if they have their own motive and they have their own um, ideas and their own notes of what they're going to say, it may not benefit you. But if you have a need on your heart and you just keep that right now in your mind, Lord, I need an answer on this right here. What do I do? What am I supposed to think? How do I fix this situation? Then the LORD WILL CAUSE WORDS TO COME out and answer that. And if he doesn't do that, then he's not the God of this Bible. But I believe he is the God of this Bible. And that's exactly how he does things, through the foolishness of preaching. And if I didn't believe that, I would never walk out that door and stand behind this desk to tell you things that I thought of. &gt;&gt; That wouldn't help you at all. But let's just go through the word of God. This this this thing we already we already kind of focused on that love one another. But I just want to talk about the enemy coming in, you know, cuz it kind of that that first paragraph talking about the enemy. Um I can I'll just I'll just just tell you how I think as a man and as a as a human being as a person the first thing that comes to my mind is okay so there's going to be somebody a person that comes into the church I just you could say that's super foolish but that's fine I'll just tell you how I think okay so I'm going to keep my eye out for the enemy so what's this enemy gonna look like is it going to be like a new person coming in right is it gonna be a stranger And and no doubt, let's just let's just tackle this one right away. No doubt we've had slickers come into the church, right? &gt;&gt; Throughout time, not just Flagstaff Tabernacle, in every church, we've had young men who come in pretending to be Christians so they can try to take one of our girls out into the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've had girls coming in pretending to be Christians so they can get one of our young men go out into the world. You've had men come in and try to woo away people from a church, &gt;&gt; right? Same exact spirit. and and have been successful sometimes. And I'm not de Christianizing people who are who who listen to that or leave. I'm saying that there the enemy sometimes comes in physically as a person. &gt;&gt; But that's the thing that's the thing about the message and that's the thing about the message of this day is when God was talking to Israel, when we look in the Bible, he's talking to Israel. He's dealing with Israel as a nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see every scripture that's in the Old Testament, he's dealing with him as a nation, which means I'm going to say something that applies to everybody. And maybe it doesn't apply to you, but I'm going to talk to you as a nation. But this morning and and throughout this time, this message is not to a group. &gt;&gt; So every time I turn on a tape, that message is not to Flagstaff Tabernacle. It's not to my family. It is to me. Because brother Bam says if THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON THAT'S going to make the rapture, you better believe that you are that person. That doesn't mean you are excluding anybody. That doesn't mean you're putting anybody out. That doesn't mean you're separating yourself. THAT MEANS LORD, I have to receive the message as an individual person. And then if we all individual people have done that and come together, then we have a group a body of believers but made up of individuals. But we we know this, right? THIS IS BASIC. BUT SO MANY TIMES THE devil will fool me. And he might try to fool you by saying, "Well, I don't know who that was for. That was maybe for the body." When every word, whether it seems fitting or not, I have to eat it. &gt;&gt; So sometimes the book is real bitter. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; When I eat it, right? Because sometimes something's preached and it's, man, it's been recently the stuff's preached, I'm just like, ouch, ouch, ouch. Okay. Yep. I do that. But but at the same time, I'm not grudgeful against the Lord. I'm not resentful against the Lord. I'm so thankful to the Lord that he cares enough for me to send somebody to go, "Hey, look, see this thing right here? That really doesn't please me." &gt;&gt; Now, this thing over here, you do do more of that. That really pleases me right here. When you have faith, that pleases me. &gt;&gt; And then he tells you what faith looks like. He tells you like we heard last Sunday. Uh to me that was more faith boosting than almost any message I've heard because it wasn't an emo for me. It was not an emotional buildup. It was a simple formula of things that I've forgotten. Brother Tom, I've sometimes forgotten. You think this is so silly. I've forgotten who the Lord is. I get into trouble and I forget who he is and I cry out to them as though he's a stranger sometimes. Now, I know that sounds maybe so foreign, but I I sometimes I pray to him as though I don't know what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; When I look through the Bible, and I don't even have to go through the Bible, Brother Kurt. I can just look through my life and stroll down memory lane just a little bit and see what he's done already in my life. And if I pray to that God and call him what he is, that's faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Well, no, no, it's got to be more complicated than that. IT'S NOT MORE COMPLICATED than that. I just forget to do it because when I get in trouble and I get in the hole, the darkness comes in and what happens? The enemy comes in. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; And you know, I we could say, "Oh, well, it's this person. Let's just let's just go down a little bit deeper." I like to I don't know. Um I'm just I'm going so fast, but I got I got I just I I want to get through Lord help me. I don't want to get through anything. I just want to get through what the Lord has. But there's so much on this subject. But but what was coming to my mind is um [clears throat] is that uh sometimes I'll give you you know a preacher might give you a conclusion to a message and then give you all the evidence for it. And then some people might spend a sermon giving you all the evidence and at the very end give you the conclusion. I I kind of want to give you some evidence. I want to give you a conclusion and I want to give you some more evidence. &gt;&gt; Okay. So we're looking for Let's just concentrate on one section of this because it's so much. Who is the enemy? &gt;&gt; Yes. Because if I know who the enemy is, I know how to I know when and how to defeat him. I know when he's talking. I know when it's not God and when it's the enemy, right? Okay. So, uh we we already covered maybe in the physical sense because it's very easy. It's very easy to put my troubles off the enemy off on somebody else. So, it's very easy and sometimes it is true. We have somebody maybe come into our family, come into our circle, come into our church who we could say, "I don't know about that person. I'm going to keep my guard up." But the word of God is has called us to go a little bit deeper into the word, right? Okay. So, I you probably know where I'm going, who the real enemy is, right? The one that we need to watch for. But what is it going to what are they going to look like? Is it going to be a stranger? But see, the scripture that brother man says, he says, or this thing that he's quoting, he says they'll actually sit and have fellowship with you. Now, that caught me. That caught my eye because the enemy that I'm supposed to be guarded against is not one that's going to look like an enemy. &gt;&gt; It's going to be one who believes kind of like I believe &gt;&gt; exactly &gt;&gt; and kind of follows what I think is right and even to the point where it's go the enemy is going to have fellowship with me. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; And also if you notice it says now the devil he said the devil is going to cause somebody to come in. So if I just read that and I just the way my brain works if the devil is going to cause somebody to come in and be your enemy then that enemy is somebody other than the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See because a lot of times what I'll do is I'll say well my enemy &gt;&gt; is is Satan. It's the devil. And as long as I'm guarded against him, but he's so slick &gt;&gt; and he's so subtle. He knows that a lot of times a direct attack against you, you'll see coming. &gt;&gt; You'll see coming. Now, sometimes I see it coming, brother Donald, and I still fall for it. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; You know that little basic thing, you don't have to say amen about this, but you know, like maybe losing your temper, like that's a kind of obvious one, right? something comes out of your mouth that you know you shouldn't have said and that's when the devil himself just like I got him. I was like I it was easy. I threw a punch and I hit him with it. But but the the the enemy that Brother Vandom is talking about is such a more subtle enemy. &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, we won't realize that he's already crept in. &gt;&gt; He's already crept in. So this per this this enemy is going to have fellowship with you. He's going to he said he'll go to church with you. Now don't nobody side eye anybody in here. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Which one of you? &gt;&gt; Definitely don't look over at your spouse or anything. You know &gt;&gt; which No. See it it what he's trying to do is he's trying brother Ram's trying to get us down. Okay. You need to look a little bit deeper for this. And I think you know I think you know where I'm going. Right. I Okay. But cuz I think we're a welltaught church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, I've given you a little bit of evidence, but the conclusion is where is the enemy? &gt;&gt; Where is the enemy that I need to be guarded against? Is it in brother Kurt, &gt;&gt; right? Is it in brother Donald? Is it in brother Steve? Is it in some random person that walked into the church? I I I see I see people shaking their head, right? Because who is the enemy &gt;&gt; who has the most influence on you? &gt;&gt; Whether you're in service, out of service, when you wake up, when you go to bed, when you're laying there, when you're trying to work, when you're trying to drive, when you're trying to pray, when you're trying to read your Bible, who's the enemy? &gt;&gt; Okay, right here. Right. And you're like, "That was it. That was the conclusion." But it's so easy to put the enemy label onto some outside thing that I have no control over, that I can't dictate, and then then the responsibility for fighting the enemy goes away with that as well. &gt;&gt; See, if I put the enemy as now listen and this has happened. If I put the enemy as somebody in service, well, I'll just stay away from service. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz I don't want to deal with that. &gt;&gt; If the enemy is my pastor, well, I'll just go find a new pastor. &gt;&gt; See, if the enemy is this thing, then I I I'm just going to avoid that. But I'm carrying around the enemy &gt;&gt; 24/7 all the time. And you say, "Well, I'm not carrying around the I'm telling you right now, you are going to have this enemy." Could everybody just like right here? &gt;&gt; This is not We've gone over this so many times and we know this. This is not redeemable. This is not savable. This is not This cannot be converted. And in this message, if we go and listen to that message that Brother Bram's talking, where where does the enemy have have property rights? &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Right here, can we just read in Colossians? Write down. I'm not just going to keep going in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Um, it pleased the Father that in him shall all fullness dwell. Now, verse 21. And you &gt;&gt; is that talking talking to you &gt;&gt; that were sometimes alienated and enemies where &gt;&gt; in your mind &gt;&gt; in your [screaming] mind by wicked works. I I love this one word right here yet. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT IS THE FORGIVENESS and the mercy and the grace of God that even though I have I HAVE BROTHER DONALD AN ENEMY [screaming] TRAVELING AROUND WITH me right here yet I've been reconciled. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; YET I'VE BEEN RECONCILED. Even though I care I I I I had notes a few years ago and I just never spoke on it about Cain and Abel. That we all are Cain and Able. You say, "I'd love to be I just able, you know, I used to be a cane and now no, you still carry around Cain cuz this guy right here still wants to kill this guy. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's the devil. It's the world." No, Satan will send in somebody to do his work for him and it's right here in my mind. And that's why it's so hard sometimes we get anxious or we get depressed or we get we get persuaded so easily because now the devil cannot make you think thoughts. Did you know that? He cannot make you. HE CANNOT PUT A THOUGHT into your mind. He does not have that power. But he has influence over your mind. So he can talk to you. He can whisper to you. And then what HAPPENS IS YOU THINK it and THEN THE THOUGHT BECOMES GENERATED FROM YOU and it has power. &gt;&gt; Yes, IT DOES. &gt;&gt; SEE, SATAN DOES NOT HAVE POWER over you. He's already a defeated devil. We know this. All right. But if he can whisper to you, oh, &gt;&gt; the enemy's it. See, oh, you know what? Uh, that that brother, he just kind of walked right by you. He doesn't even I don't even think he No, he's got something AGAINST YOU. AND WHAT happens is you start to think that here and it drops down into here and the enemy's work is done. WHY? BECAUSE NOW YOU are generating a belief from your own heart. &gt;&gt; It's not the devil who made me do it. It's that it's it's that nature &gt;&gt; standing right behind you saying, &gt;&gt; "Oh, yeah. You're you're not changed. &gt;&gt; Oh, there. Oh, you you know what? You you pretend to be a Christian." Anybody ever heard him say this to you? Oh, you thought you were saved. Oh, you thought you were born again, but then you made that little mistake. And then what happens is you stop and listen &gt;&gt; for one moment &gt;&gt; and THEN IT BECOMES YOUR THOUGHT. &gt;&gt; He plants a seed and THEN IT BECOMES YOUR THOUGHT. AND WHEN THAT THOUGHT DROPS DOWN into here, you believe it. &gt;&gt; And then EVERYTHING YOU DO, ALL of your beliefs are that you don't really belong. And the enemy has gotten in. And then when he does that, I I'll tell you, one of the first things that you'll see is you'll stop loving one another. &gt;&gt; Or maybe you'll have love for one another, but it won't be above everything. It'll drop down to, oh, I sure love I sure love people. I sure love the saints. I sure love my family. But something else will take its place. &gt;&gt; I I'm going to read something in a minute. I I don't know if that makes sense to you, but we were we were alienated from God in our minds. &gt;&gt; He knows. See, that's the thing is God knows this enemy is coming in. I better hurry. He knows this enemy is coming in. He knows it. &gt;&gt; He knows what you're dealing with. And he's put in us somebody to combat the enemy. &gt;&gt; Do does that make sense? He's put in you the ability and he's put in you somebody a person who is built in to combat that enemy. All right. So, but he knows what's in you. Jesus even said he said, "Have I not chosen you 12 and one of you is the devil?" See, he knows where the enemy He knows that the enemy is and and and how do you know? Now, now listen, we're reading the Bible and we see Judas and we're like, "Okay, well, it's pretty obvious. It's pretty obvious it was Judas, right? I mean, I'm not going to be fooled by that one." But we have a Judas in our midst right now. And sometimes we don't recognize him. No side eyes, no looking around. I'm not talking about somebody next to you. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about there's a Judas sometimes at home. somebody who is who listen now. You know what Judas did? He believed in God. &gt;&gt; He followed God. He fellowshipped with God. HE TOOK COMMUNION WITH GOD. He cast out devils in Jesus' name. He called him pastor. He called him all these things. &gt;&gt; And he was the enemy. &gt;&gt; I I just found this scripture interesting. Can we read a scripture? Matthew 26:12. Uh I'm just going to flip to it real quick. And I was read I I I think I showed this maybe to Aiden a few months or so ago. And I was like, I just want you to see the I just I thought I found this interesting. If you've already read it, uh just enjoy it for a second time. Matthew 26, we're talking about now the Passover. We're talking about the Lord's supper when he's talking about somebody who is going to uh betray him. You want to know how to identify? Now, this is great when it's a Bible story, but how about right now, how do I apply this? Do you want to know how to identify the enemy who is assaulting you? &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. I got there's a few yet. Do you want to really really know? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Here's how you know this simple. You said the Passover. Yes. The Passover. Let's just read this. Um 26:21. And as they did eat, he said, "Verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me." And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And he answered and said, "He that dipth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. The son of man goeth as it is written of him. But woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed. It had been good for that man if he had not been born. Then Judas who betrayed him answered and said, "Master, is it I?" And he said unto him, "Thou hast said." Okay, so I I Aiden and I were talking about this. I said, I just want you to now I don't know. We we can't really show two verses at once, right? I'm going put Pauline to the Are we still okay this morning? &gt;&gt; Are you okay? I I know this might I'm sorry if this is a little bit boring. I'm sorry if this is basic, but this is like this for me is is how I want to identify this guy's enemy &gt;&gt; who is not you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And can I say this? It's not the world. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; It's right. It lives right in here. Right in here is this enemy. If we could put two verses, man, the technology. All right. Verse 22 and verse 25. And once I saw this a few months ago, and you might already know this, but I was just like, "Wow, what a difference one word makes." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if not, we'll just go back and forth between them. &gt;&gt; They both have the same question. &gt;&gt; Do you see the difference? The 11 disciples call him Lord and Judas calls him master. You say, "Well, that's that's that's nuance. That's translation." You know, Jesus didn't answer their first question when they said, "Lord, is it I?" He just kept going. And when Judas calls him master, he says, "You have said these two words are different words in the Bible. Now, they sound like they're the same, but they're not the same. Lord, is it I? This word means supreme in authority. &gt;&gt; It means, this is a hard word in 2025 where we're all independent, right? And strong. Controller. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Controller. &gt;&gt; Correct. So the disciples without even knowing what they were saying identified Jesus as the one who owns them. &gt;&gt; Correct? &gt;&gt; No. But 2025 society would say nobody owns me. &gt;&gt; I'm independent. I don't have I what does the Bible said? I have need of nothing. I control what I do. I control whether I go to church. I control whether I raise my hand OR NOT. I'M IN CHARGE. NOW, maybe those words never go through our mind or through our lips, but the actions dictate exactly that. I know that. I'm going to decide, brother Donald, when I'm going to pray. I'm going to decide to do this because I'm the master. And see, and Judas's master means rabbi. It mean, you know what it means? It means you're a good man. You're a good teacher. You're a you are a good person. Many people believe that Jesus is a good person and follow him and fellowship with him, but they've never ever given him ownership. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that you can only call Jesus the Lord &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; SO THERE'S MANY people who have called him Lord, &gt;&gt; who have called him Lord, &gt;&gt; but have never made him Lord. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; That can only be done by the Holy Ghost. Amen. And and you say, "Well, there's not that big OF A DIFFERENCE." ONE SHOWS THAT YOU'RE TOTALLY surrendered to the word and to the author of the word. &gt;&gt; And one shows that you will agree with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's hard. Oh, I know. I agree. I agree with what's preached on. I agree with the message. I agree with it's in the Bible. That's good. So did Judas. Now, &gt;&gt; I'm not calling YOU A JUDAS. I'M SAYING THAT DOESN'T MEAN the enemy isn't already crept into the camp. And see, he's so subtle. YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT SOMETIMES JUST GOING TO COME OUT AND GO, "OH, that's false. Don't follow that. That's false. Just get away from that and go do your own thing." He'll, you know what he'll tell you? Oh, no. You believe it. You believe it. &gt;&gt; No, you believe the message. You believe the Bible. Look, you you went to church. You said, "Amen." You do those things. What do you believe Jesus is? Oh, he's he's he's he's the son of God. He's he's a good man. Who's William Brandham? Oh, he was a he was a good man. You know how many times I've heard, "Oh, William Brandham, oh, he's a good man. He's a good prophet." I I don't think that he's any more than a man. Can I just start there? &gt;&gt; He's not any more than a man. I'm We don't deify William Brandham. If we do, that's a whole different enemy that's crept in, &gt;&gt; you know, right? Because some people say there's nothing to him and then some people make him God. BUT IF GOD HAS CHOSEN SOMEBODY, whether it's William Brandham or a 10-year-old child, to come up and talk to you, then I need to pay attention to that and not just get rid of it because of the source that it came from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's how the enemy will come in. He'll come in so subtly. And one one of these things shows that you would go all the way. See, ownership, brother Tom, means that you don't own your destination. You don't own what what happens to you. You don't own the concept. Look, listen. It's all good. I I think I was talking about this a couple weeks ago that we have a built-in we have a built-in survival instinct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. We have a built and I can prove it to you. &gt;&gt; If if you right now, if I'm not going to make anybody do it, but if you right now stood right here and you fall, let's do a trust fall, and you fall, you know, without you even knowing, without you even trying, you're going to put your hands up. you're going to do it. &gt;&gt; And it's not because you're bad. It's not because you're evil. It's because the body has a built-in thing that is going to make itself survive. So, right before you hit even a second, you're going to put your hands out and stop. It's reflex. It's it's you're not even going to know it's because there's something built in that has to go away. Sure. &gt;&gt; THERE CANNOT BE THERE CANNOT [screaming] BE A partially surrendered Christian &gt;&gt; THAT AT THE VERY END OF THINGS, LORD, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU ALL THINGS. I'm going to give you preeminence of my life. I'm going to give you ALL THINGS, BUT RIGHT AT THE VERY END, I'm going to put my hands out and I'm going to save myself. I cannot have ownership of my life and my death and my family's life and my family's death. Although I want to I want to control it, right? But if I'm the controller, then I'm the God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, if I'm the controller, then I'm Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the enemy has already gotten in. &gt;&gt; I have to I have to let that go and give it to him. &gt;&gt; And the enemy will tell you, "What are you doing?" &gt;&gt; The enemy right here will tell you, "No, no, no, no, no. You need to survive. What good are you dead? I'm &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it's the truth. &gt;&gt; It's exactly how he works. He doesn't come just with these He doesn't come with these ways that are like, "Oh, okay. I see you coming a mile away. There's the devil. A train roaring through the station." No, it's a little tiny tiny whisper. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; And that that that that sign out there &gt;&gt; is saying this is gonna happen. And when that happens, now listen, I I I don't know. I I really if you could just I know this is Can we just be awkward for a minute? &gt;&gt; Like I'm looking around. This is all family. Just turn to the person next to you. I don't care who that is. If they're close to you, grab them by the hand. That person is going through exactly what you're going through. &gt;&gt; That person and I know it's it's it's it's awkward, right? Just to sit and look. Brother Tom's facing the same enemy that I'm facing. &gt;&gt; Correct. Amen. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Because the lie of the enemy, the biggest lie of the enemy is that nobody else around you is dealing with what you're dealing with. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sure they have problems, but they're they're not struggling with they're not struggling with what I don't they're not struggling with the thoughts I'm struggling against. Yes, they are. And if you look them in the eyes for 10 seconds, you probably will struggle to look in their eyes for 10 seconds because you'll see it and they'll see it in you. And we become vulnerable. I know that's a hard word, right? In 2025, we become vulnerable because you realize somebody else is going through exactly the same battle. And when you do that, then you can have a love JUST IN A 10-SECOND connection with somebody else. You can have a love that you could not have had if some man comes stands up here and tells you to love everybody. &gt;&gt; It sounds great. OH, THAT'S A GREAT MESSAGE. LOVE EVERYBODY. BUT GET IN SOMEBODY'S GET IN SOMEBODY'S BATTLE WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; AND ALL THE THINGS YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THEM. OH, they're this and they're that. Oh, they're Well, maybe they're going through a battle. No, nobody say amen on this part because this is just FOR ME. OH, MAYBE THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A BATTLE BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST NOT FAITHFUL ENOUGH. WELL, MAYBE IF THEY if they did this more, they wouldn't be going through what they're going through. &gt;&gt; You ever you ever listen? Have you ever thought that? &gt;&gt; You know who that is? That's the enemy. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It's not that person. It's the enemy telling you. And so that thought will drop down to here. And then what you'll do is you'll fail the first line of the word of the church, which is love that person above everything else. Which means love them above their issue. Love them above. Listen now. Love them above their unbelief. &gt;&gt; We do not call sin good. We do not call unbelief belief. There is true mistakes. There are true things that we all do wrong. But you love him above those things. You know how I know that that's the right way? Because Christ loved me when I was an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; The Bible SAYS WHEN I WAS HIS ENEMY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; UNLOVABLE. &gt;&gt; He loved me. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; AND WE SAY, WE SAY AS CHRISTIANS, I HAVE THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST in me. &gt;&gt; Speak the truth. &gt;&gt; The spirit of Christ LOVES SOMEBODY EVEN WHEN they're your enemy. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And I got news for you. There's not a person in here that you can look to your left or your right that's your enemy. &gt;&gt; Not one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's not one in here that's your enemy. You know why? I'm looking around. All I see are people. Thank goodness we have maybe a small church, brother Donald, right now because right now I just see people who love the person that's next to them who love the persons that's across the pew. You're like, "Well, I've already I've already I've already succeeded. I love everybody here." THANK GOD THAT YOU HAVE SOMEBODY who loves you because you got a closer enemy than that person. AND IF WE HAVE THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST, YOU'RE going to love somebody when they're fighting their own enemy. CORRECT. &gt;&gt; AND YOUR LOVE FOR that person, you think, "Oh, it's so it's so uh can I just use the word cheesy? It's so che What do you mean love them? I'm going to love them." That is the power to that they will overcome with. &gt;&gt; Instead of saying, "Well, brother Donald, let me just tell you what you can do to get over that enemy." No, no, no, no. Love him. &gt;&gt; And he'll say, "Well, wait a minute. I'm going." See, he's going through a battle in his mind. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going through a battle [snorts] &gt;&gt; and he goes, "Wait a minute. I I know this battle. I mean, I just showed this whole battle to everybody like every single day. &gt;&gt; Especially our spouses, especially our family, and they're still loving me. Oh my gosh, that gives me hope. &gt;&gt; That gives me faith. That gives me Wait a minute. That isn't me. They They don't love the enemy. They must see something else." What is that? That's the spirit of Christ in action in his body. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS GREAT, RIGHT? THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS GREAT. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY Spirit is great. BUT BUT IT'S ONLY GREAT WHEN IT'S IN ACTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE THE BROTHER RAN WOULD SAY, "I COULD HAVE I COULD HAVE A A WHOLE A WHOLE THE ALL the blood RIGHT HERE, BUT IF IT WAS NEVER SHED for you, it doesn't do you any good. I want a God with skin on him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is not the minister twice a week. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, we what do we do? WE PUT IT OFF ONTO THE MINISTER. Oh yes, the the minister anointed. Certainly, we hope our ministers are anointed. BUT I BETTER BE ANOINTED WHEN I'M TALKING TO MY MY WIFE. WIFE, YOU BETTER BE ANOINTED WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR HUSBAND. CHILDREN, YOU BETTER BE ANOINTED WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR PARENTS. PARENTS, TO your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There has to be there. THERE HAS TO BE MORE THAN JUST TWICE A WEEK RELIGION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHERE WE COME TOGETHER. AND I SEE, OH, BROTHER DONALD, you made it through the week. Amen. Brother Curt, you're still here. Brother Jerry, you're still here. Amen. We get together. This is where I get strength from to go out and fight the battle. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT where we SHOULD COME AND HAVE BATTLES. ALTHOUGH I KNOW I know what it is. I know what it's like to be in 2025. The battle's raging right now. Right now, the mind battle is like, "Oh, I don't know what I was saying. Oh, the so- and so did this to me." Sometimes we're not even thinking about church. &gt;&gt; We're thinking about what I got to deal with tomorrow. what I just dealt with yesterday. We're thinking about the argument on the way to church in the car. &gt;&gt; But the person you got into an argument with is going through the same battles you are. They have the enemy. I'm just repeating myself, but it's so this is where THIS IS WHERE THE DEVIL TRIPS US UP. &gt;&gt; CORRECT. &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO identify the enemy? You want to identify the enemy? It's the one who hasn't given God ownership. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, who's going to do that for you? Nobody's going to be your enemy. It's this guy right here who doesn't give the Lord ownership. Not one pastor, NOT ONE PREACHER, NOT ONE CHURCH, not one sinner can make you not give the Lord ownership. Not one. Only I can keep that. [snorts] Brother Ram says this. I'm I got I got 19 minutes. Are we okay? Now, if you notice what caused the trouble, there was a mixed multitude went up with them. The supernatural have been done down in Egypt. Have we not had I'm I'm sorry. I'm just going to keep stopping. Have we not had supernatural things happen in our church? &gt;&gt; WE'VE HAD SUPERNATURAL I'M SORRY, BUT IF YOU ARE IF THE DOCTORS SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DIE AND YOU DON'T DIE, OH WELL, I GUESS IT WAS JUST NATURE THAT TOOK OVER. NO, IT'S A SUPERNATURAL ACT. IF I WANT TO OPEN MY EYES. NOW, THE ENEMY WILL TELL ME, "OH, IT WAS JUST the healing process of the body. IT WAS THOSE VITAMINS that you took. IT WAS THE MEDICINE." I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S A SUPERNATURAL ACT. WHEN I GET A TEXT ON MY PHONE THAT SAYS, "SISTER CONNIE HAS DIED AND SISTER CONNIE IS STILL WITH US." THAT'S A supernatural act. I'm sorry, Sister Connie. Maybe I I'm sure you don't get tired of it. You know why? Because you're alive to tell the testimony of it. You say, "Well, that hasn't happened to me." IF IF THE DEVIL HAS SAID THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN and it goes the other way, there's a supernatural ACT. AND THAT'S THE THING WE'RE FAILING TO SEE. Sometimes I'm failing to see. Let me put it ON ME. I'M FAILING TO SEE THE SUPERNATURAL WORKING IN MY life every single day. I'm looking for a God, brother Donald, of 2,000 years ago. Correct. &gt;&gt; I'm looking FOR A GOD OF 2,000 YEARS AGO WHEN HE'S CHANGED HIS form and he's he's Is he the same God? Oh, yes, he's the SAME GOD. BUT I GOT A quote right here that Brother Man says, "WE DO NOT LOOK FOR NAIL SCARRED HANDS." OH, what are you talking about? You're saying he didn't die on THE CROSS. I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S A THOMAS MENTALITY, AND I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE A THOMAS MENTALITY. WELL LORD, IF I SEE THE NAIL SCARS IN YOUR HAND, HE SAYS, "WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR NAIL SCARS. WE'RE LOOKING FOR HIM TO BE MADE MANIFEST IN HIS PEOPLE." [applause] &gt;&gt; And if I JUST PUT THAT OFF, YOU KNOW WHAT THE ENEMY WILL TELL YOU? OKAY. All right. You're right. You're right. In his people, that's somebody else. &gt;&gt; The enemy working. He's He's working a fulltime job because every time you take another step up in the Lord, he's got to change his attack a little bit. Okay. Well, okay. After that one service, he's good at it. He's a worthy average. After that one service, you know, after she was healed, after he was delivered, I can't really attack him with that anymore. So, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to up my game. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say, "OH, YEAH, YOU were delivered of it, but now you backslid back into it." &gt;&gt; Oh, after you gave your heart to the Lord, I can't really Well, you know, let me try a new tactic. Oh, you you you just you were just worked up. &gt;&gt; Exactly. That wasn't real. Look at those things you thought yesterday. The enemy inside planting, planting, planting, planting, hoping. &gt;&gt; You know that the devil hopes. &gt;&gt; You know what he hopes? That you listen and that you that thought drops down right here. Cuz if that happens, then your actions start to dictate what you believe. &gt;&gt; I'm just way off on notes. I It doesn't matter. When the supernatural had been done, everybody flocked to it. And it caused a mixed multitude to go with them. Unregenerated, unconverted hearts going up trying to impersonate the real believer. &gt;&gt; And it's then in that in the days of Noah, it was in the days of Christ. It's prophesied in God's word to be the same thing in this day. The supernatural has been done. There's a mixed multitude gone up unregenerated. HEART'S NOT CONDITIONED, NOT keeping God's word, but impersonating something. See, if we're drawn to that's why sometimes the even the message of the hour is somebody's drawn to it and then it fades and there's a falling away because they were drawn to what is clearly supernatural. But the supernatural never came and made itself at home inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Always looking for the supernatural to be done. somewhere else, somewhere else. And God is saying, "No, no, no. I'm not that. I'm not THAT GOD. I'M NOT THAT GOD WHO'S walking around with the disciples following him. I have changed my form." &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; You're looking for me on a cross. I'm not on the cross anymore. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE LOOKING FOR NAIL SCARRED HANDS. NO, NO, NO, NO. BLESSED ARE YOU WHEN YOU DON'T SEE ME &gt;&gt; AND YET YOU BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And it's so simple. WE GO BACK TO THESE SUNDAY school scriptures. The world will see me no more, but I'll be with you, even in you. And I think if the enemy can distract you, IT FROM THE MOST IMPORTANT thing that he'll distract you from is that God has put something inside of you to combat that enemy. &gt;&gt; Correct? &gt;&gt; I know this is like basic. Come on. Basic salvation. But I think but I THINK SOMETIME I I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A FIRM grasp on what our salvation actually means. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Because if we have a a revelation, I know, man, we just throw around a bunch of words, revelation. BUT IF YOU HAVE A REVELATION OF YOUR SALVATION, YOU REALIZE THAT IF HE'S SAVED ME, HE CAN NEVER LOSE ME. THAT IF I HAVE HIM LIVING INSIDE, I CANNOT DO ENOUGH [screaming] TO GET RID OF IT. THAT EVEN IN SPITE OF ME, WHEN I'M ALIENATED MYSELF BECAUSE OF MY MIND BECAUSE SOMETIMES, I MEAN, I'M SORRY, BUT sometimes I've listened to the ENEMY &gt;&gt; AND I'VE THOUGHTS ABOUT PEOPLE AND I'VE SAID THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE AND I'VE I'VE SEEN HOLY GHOST FILILLED PEOPLE BE POISONED BY THE DEVIL. IT doesn't make them any less Holy Ghost filled. &gt;&gt; No, no. It's just there HAS TO BE A RECOGNITION that with an enemy also you can have somebody to combat that enemy. I'm telling you right now, I can't defeat that enemy, but I also wasn't called to. It's already been defeated. BUT WHAT I HAVE TO DO is by revelation accept and recognize that that one who's whispering to me has already been defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can say, "Oh, the devil in the world has been defeated. Oh, that devil of cancer is being defeated." Sometimes it's that devil of cancer that comes around whispering. Sometimes that devil of uh of of migraine that comes around and whispering. Sometimes it's that devil anxiety and you go, "Well, I thought that devil was defeated." Yeah, it's that inner one who is always nature. If we just look at nature, nature [snorts] is trying to kill us. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; I don't mean to be funny, but that is the truth. If you look at the nature of the world, it is just trying to eradicate all of us. There'll be a new disease, there'll be a new plague, there'll be a new earthquake, there'll be a new flood. Okay? What do you think this nature is trying to do? That's why it's not savable. It's not It cannot be converted. I I'm I'm just going to keep going. If you notice what caused this trouble, there was a mixed multitude went up with them. The supernatural have been done. Did I just read that? Okay, I just read that one. Unconverted minds, unconverted hearts. And you will say, "Okay, I don't know who this message is for. I've been converted." And that may be the truth. You know what? I'm not here to doubt anybody's conversions, anybody's salvation. In fact, what we should be doing, what we should be doing is saying, "LOOK, I DON'T CARE WHAT the devil says you got the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, this isn't to lie to people because HE CAN ONLY GIVE YOU THE HOLY Ghost when you believe he's given you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, that it's it's it's so backwards from our way of thinking. Oh Lord, when I when I get to the place you can give me the Holy Ghost, you'll give it to me and then I'll confess that you've given it to me and you're going to go a long time without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And you know who's telling you to do that? The enemy is telling you to do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if I said, "Brother Donald, I'm going to give you this phone. I'm going to give it to you. It's a promise." &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a promise, Brother Donald. I'm going to hand you this. Now, you can sit there, brother Don, you can go to church service after church service after church service, praise the Lord, call him, all these things, say that he's Lord, all those things, but until you start saying, "Amen. I got that phone that he was going to give me. I got that phone." Now, somebody's going to look at you and go, "What phone? &gt;&gt; Show it to me. &gt;&gt; Sure." &gt;&gt; You know, I can't explain it to you. I just I I I just believe it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. And the enemy go, "Well, you're still doing this. You're still doing this. You're still thinking this." Listen, enemy, you you you either going to stay around. You're either going to leave or you're going to become one of us. &gt;&gt; I I'll get to that in just a minute if I got time. I'm running out of time. But you have to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And confess and live and act as though you have this. And then he goes, "There you go. That's the confirmation of the faith that you already had. &gt;&gt; Simple, right? This is this is but but but I forget it sometimes. And it works that way with healing. See, if he does it one way, he does it that way. It works with healing that way. Listen, the salvation of your family, it works exactly the same way. You got to have the token. Now, if I said, "Brother Donald, this is what he really does. Take that." And on that piece of paper is written, I'm going to give you the phone. You can take that and you can show it right to the enemy and go, "Look, I got a promise right here." Oh, but you know what the enemy will tell you? Well, that's not the real thing. It's as good as the real thing. He says, "TAKE THAT TOKEN." I JUST READ IT THIS MORNING. You mind if I read it? It's no coincidence. I just happen to look it up this morning. And he says this, "In him is no death. In him is no sorrow. In him is no weary. In him is no sin. In him is no sickness. In him is no death. We are in him." If Satan tries to hand you something like sickness, take your token. &gt;&gt; IT'S SO POWERFUL THAT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE THIS. [laughter] [snorts and clears throat] You can take THE TOKEN OF IT. YOU can take, LISTEN, THAT'S HOW POWERFUL THE LORD IS. HE PROMISES YOU THE HOLY GHOST. YOU CAN TAKE THE PROMISE AND GO DEFEAT THE DEVIL WITH IT. &gt;&gt; JUST THE PROMISE OF IT. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Sometimes we lose to the devil because you go, "Well, once I get once I get it, oh, you're in trouble." TAKE THE PROMISE OF IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE TOKEN IS. TAKE THE PROMISE OF IT AND GO DEFEAT HIM. This isn't to rile up emotion. This isn't to rile THE PEOPLE. WE'RE LIVING UNDERNEATH OUR PRIVILEGE. WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE BEING DEFEATED by an enemy who who has no rights over us because he's made you FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO show him this in order to defeat him. You can show him the promise of it. &gt;&gt; AND THE PROMISE OF THE HOLY GHOST will make him flee from you or I love this or make him become one of you. &gt;&gt; I I want to get to that in a second. Why I just messed up my phone. Hang on. All right. Don't worry about it. &gt;&gt; I I told you I was going to ignore this timer, but it it hasn't gone off yet. It hasn't gone off yet. &gt;&gt; Okay. Take your token and apply it. Take your token and apply it that you are a purchased product of Jesus Christ. The token that stands that your fair is paid. &gt;&gt; He says, he says, the devil, when you die, you're lost. Watch him. You know what he's trying to do? &gt;&gt; Okay, you're good, but make sure you don't give ownership of your life. &gt;&gt; See, when you die, what does he do? He's praying on the fear of what happens to us when we die. So that AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE, I'll put my hands out and I'll try to save myself. See how he does? It's so It's so Well, it's so evil, first of all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he prays on on legitimate fears. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the but THE THE THE WHAT GOD DOES WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT should be doing in our life is alleviating and getting rid of the fear of death. &gt;&gt; And the only way can I just I just want to BE STRAIGHT. THE ONLY REASON why we have a fear of death besides maybe some obvious painful right it could be painful. But the reason why we fear death is because if we don't know where we're going when death comes. That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's really that I mean we can't imagine the pain of death. All of us are alive. But if we fear death, it's for that reason. &gt;&gt; We fear it because there is an unknown on the other side of it. And so he puts a fear in our life and through the fear then tells you this. See, &gt;&gt; you don't know where you're going. &gt;&gt; See how he does that? See, if you were, look at brother so and so, man. He knows where he's going. If you were a Christian like he was, &gt;&gt; you wouldn't fear death. Don't tell me the devil doesn't come in and talk to you just like that. That's exactly the way he works. &gt;&gt; See, if you were a Christian like them, see, if you really had the Holy Ghost, look at that brother professing where he's going. Look at that sister saying, "I know where I'm going." You don't know where you're going. &gt;&gt; But see, you know what they're doing? They're waving that around. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what they're doing? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right here. &gt;&gt; I know where I'm going. Can you prove it to me? Yes. Right here. See this promise? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT PROMISE DOES NOT say condition this, condition this, condition this. If you do this, I just have to accept this. I just have to accept the promise. Just repent. &gt;&gt; Be baptized. Okay, that's I remember I remember brother Jerry preaching this unconditional love. I don't know if you remember speaking about that, Jerry. The love is unconditional. But to accept it, &gt;&gt; to accept it, there are conditions. What are the conditions? Not that you're good, not that you think right, not that you act right, not that you do right. No, I just have to accept it that it was given to me while I was alienated from him. While I was dead, he gave me life. Not when I was ALREADY ALIVE, BUT WHEN I was dead, he gave me life. This is my claim to where I go when I die. And if you you say, "Well, that's that's your claim." See, that's what that's what I'm waving around, but I'm using this right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what you have faith in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you have faith in this, even though every enemy &gt;&gt; tells you otherwise, &gt;&gt; that's what pleases the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; That's what pleases the Lord. In spite of you, IN SPITE OF YOU telling yourself all the reasons why you shouldn't be there yourself says, you know what, that is true. You know what, Lord? True, Lord. True, Lord. I am a dog. True, Lord. But the dog has rights to the scraps off the master's table. Amen. &gt;&gt; True Lord, I may be all those things, but I have your promise. I have your token. Undeserved, unearned. &gt;&gt; That's the best part about it. It's the best part about it. Freely given. Brother Donald, give it to whoever you want to. &gt;&gt; Freely given, freely received. The Lord will bless you with things. I I was just talking the other day with with with my WIFE ABOUT THIS. THE LORD will bless you with things and he'll give you things. sometimes just to see if you'll give them up, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or is that is that a little bit of an ouch? &gt;&gt; He'll give you material blessings. He'll give you financial blessings. He'll give you health blessings. He'll give you all these blessings just to see if you'll put it before him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll test. &gt;&gt; Yes, he will. &gt;&gt; Whose owner? &gt;&gt; He'll test who's your Lord. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't even know where I'm at. Am I um I got I got a few minutes. It'll be okay. [snorts] &gt;&gt; This is how Jesus dealt with the enemy. &gt;&gt; He brought Judas into dinner with him. &gt;&gt; He took communion with him. &gt;&gt; He washed his feet. That's not how I deal with the enemy. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Listen that. Pray for that man. I'm reading this out of that paragraph earlier that he'll be saved too or that woman or whoever it is. See, it changes when I put myself in there. &gt;&gt; See, because when it tells me, "Well, pray for that brother and sister," you're like, "Okay, I'll I'll try to remember to do that." or you know, I'll do that. And I I'm not being I I hate I'm not trying to be flippant with that, but &gt;&gt; okay, I'll pray for them. &gt;&gt; But when it's you, &gt;&gt; it changes it. &gt;&gt; The prayer becomes a little more fervent. &gt;&gt; It becomes a little more desperate, right? The enemy will come. and when he does cling that much closer together. And the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in. See, there's got to be a total separation. I just I'm going to I'm going to close with this. There's got to be a total separation from sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was just looking for a a tissue here. I got one. Total [snorts] separation from sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I I'm going to I want to say this and I'm going to say this like not as as a throw. I I there's a there's a quote that Brother Ram says many times. He says, "We want mixers, but God is looking for separators." Now, I've heard that quoted my whole life. And I've heard it quoted properly. I'm not throwing it. And I've heard it taken out of context. Sure. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when it's taken out of context is when the devil will use that quote to go, "Oh, see, God wants you to separate. So, go ahead and separate &gt;&gt; from anybody who disagrees with you, anybody who doesn't see things your way, anybody who gives you this look, anybody who says this, and maybe they didn't even do anything. Anybody who you think has something against you, &gt;&gt; go ahead and separate from them. See, God wants, and then he'll bring a quote. God wants separators. And then I'll feel pretty good about God wants separators. I'm going to separate myself from unbelief. And and that's the paradox of the word is that God's saying, "Separate from unbelief. Separate from sin, but cling to one another like you never have before. There's what is he saying? It's and this this was brought up I think in a minister's meeting uh brother Steve and I went to months ago and I loved it. It stuck with me. He said God is a separator. Satan is a divider. &gt;&gt; Very good. Very good. Very good. &gt;&gt; You didn't hear that alarm, right? He's a divider. &gt;&gt; He gets in and he divides. &gt;&gt; He gets in between. He gets he gets a wedge in there, starts dividing you from Listen, you could you could I just want to be I just want to be real frank and this is so basic, but if you think that that dividing and and and getting yourself away from somebody who doesn't believe like you, okay, I I can maybe go through with that. We don't we don't fellowship with the world. We don't fellowship with sin. We don't fellowship with unbelief. Amen. We can all say amen to that. Okay. Do not think that that same attack will not keep coming closer and closer to home. So when you do that, if we don't keep the right attitude, if we don't keep the right spirit, if we don't keep the right view of who the real enemy is, this is what he'll do. He'll divide and conquer. So first, he'll divide. He'll say, "Well, if you're not in the message, um, you're not a believer." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've met believers &gt;&gt; that are not in the message. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, do they know what I know? I maybe not. But I'm tell you, they're doing more with what they know than I'm doing with what I know. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And maybe they're believing the light of their day. I'm not going to put them I'm not going to categorize them, right? But what the what the devil will do is he'll say, "Oh, you know, that's a PROPER THING. DON'T DON'T fellowship don't fellowship with the Moabites. You've categorized them." Well, if you have the truth, how are they supposed to receive the truth &gt;&gt; if you've divided yourself? &gt;&gt; And should we be wise? We've heard this so many times. Do you go into the bar? &gt;&gt; There's no need to do that, right? &gt;&gt; But God will, if you have a heart for it, God will present you with an opportunity to talk to that person. Okay, so let's just That's the first attempt. Well, divide yourself from there. And then we could do that and we could feel pretty good. Okay. Well, you know what? I've divided myself off. I found all the quotes about denominations and I've I've separated myself from denominations. Now I'm just in the message. &gt;&gt; The message just becomes a denomination. &gt;&gt; Okay. Then what'll happen? The the tag gets closer, right? So then it'll say, well, &gt;&gt; you know, I'm in a message church, &gt;&gt; but they just don't quite believe it the way that I believe it. They're a little bit I mean I see it but like I need this and I see this and they don't quite see it the same way. Um I don't know if that's a place for me. And then you take all the separation quotes and you feel good about separating and the enemy is just like I'm loving this &gt;&gt; because he's dividing &gt;&gt; and you think okay well I can justify that you know and there are there are way can you never leave a church and go to another church? Of course you can. That's not what I'm preaching against. &gt;&gt; But know that an attack is coming closer and closer. Okay? So he's going to So he'll do that. And if you feel good about that one, he'll say, you know, you know, your son, he's just not living the way that you want him to live. And you know, you stand by the word &gt;&gt; and the word says don't compromise. And the word says all this. And you know, the Lord's not calling for mixers. He's calling for separate. All the same quotes start coming up. And you know, if he would just if she would just live the way that you believe that the way the Bible says, the way the the message teaches. Um, but until they do, I got to cut I got to cut them off. And then that one hurts a little bit, right? But our religion &gt;&gt; makes us feel like it's the right thing. And you know what that religion is? It's the enemy. &gt;&gt; You know, pretty soon it will be and pretty soon it will be, you know, my husband just doesn't my wife just doesn't see what I see. &gt;&gt; And I'm just, you know, I I see all the scriptures about unequally yolked. And I start to see all these things. And you know what? Maybe it would be better if I just be a believing Christian who's unmarried. You know, the attack gets even closer and closer. So, let's say you've done that. Now, the attack comes inside because there's nobody else to separate from. He just keeps dividing. And pretty soon, the division is you against you. &gt;&gt; And and I hate to be so dark about this, man. That's not the way I wanted to like to end this, but we wonder why in this day that suicide, anxiety, depression, mental illness, all these things, it's a spiritual battle. I &gt;&gt; I do realize that there are physical properties to it. I realize that. But it's a battle when the enemy has gotten you to try to divide you and fight against yourself. It's it's a the best way to say it's an autoimmune disease, &gt;&gt; but it's a spiritual autoimmune disease where you've you've separated from the world. You separated from the denomination. You separated from that church who didn't think like you do. You separated from family who doesn't see things like you do. And yet you're still not at peace. And yet when you lay down, you're still not content. You're still not And I'm not preaching this in one person. I'm saying this is how the enemy gets in. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if you let him in, &gt;&gt; which he's Can I just He's in. &gt;&gt; We got We're carrying around an enemy. That's why I can see Christians. I can even see it in the prophet himself who preached for 30 something years. And at the end of his ministry, you know what HE SAID? I LOST the feeling for the people &gt;&gt; because the entire time he's still Yes. man of God. Anointed man of God. Yes. all those things still carrying around an enemy named William Brandham &gt;&gt; and he'd be the first one to tell you that it's right in THE MESSAGE &gt;&gt; STILL CARRYING IT AROUND UNTIL the day we get off and and even last WEEK I WAS SO I was so uh encouraged to hear about brother Dig started going into that theophony we were talking about IT EARLIER SEE THIS IS MY ENEMY BUT SOMETIMES GOD ALLOWS YOU TO GET INTO A CONNECTION with with with oh IT'S SO GOOD WITH SOME PART PART OF YOU THAT IS NOT YOUR ENEMY THAT YOU'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED UNLESS YOU'RE IN THAT dimension and you're in THAT PRESENCE AND SEE THAT'S WHAT LISTEN that's what we need to be looking for &gt;&gt; THE PROBLEM WITH LE OYSIA and the problem with 2025 I know I think every single time I preach it's like the problem is the problem is but I I WANT TO IDENTIFY WHAT I'M doing wrong so I could I can I know what the enemy is so when I say the problem is it's like this is what I'M DOING THE PROBLEM WITH ME in Le Oysia, the problem is is that I'm looking for a Christ of 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; SEE, IN 2,000 YEARS AGO when they had the most h the listen, the most Christian, the most sacred living, the cleanest living, the best Christians you could have, they weren't called Christians, but you know what I'm TALKING ABOUT. THE BEST believers that were on the earth at that time were looking for a God of 2,000 years ago that belonged to Moses. And when he appeared among them, &gt;&gt; they didn't recognize him because they were looking for a god of their father, &gt;&gt; of their father's father, a god in a Bible. That's why sometimes this doesn't have an impact to people and they'll listen to a tape and they go, "Oh, that was pretty good." Because they're looking for the God of William Brham 50 years ago when he's not THAT. HE'S CHANGED HIS FORM. He's working in the church right now, but only to those who are looking for him &gt;&gt; AND HAVE LISTEN, HE'S NOT COMING. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; He's here. Brother Donald, we're looking FOR A OH, IF WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES, this is how I'll act IN CHURCH. THE HOLY SPIRIT'S HERE. AND IF I'M NOT BEING THE WAY THE HOLY SPIRIT IS TELLING ME TO BE, I'M MISSING it as IT PASSES BY. I ENJOY GOOD WORSHIP SERVICE. I enjoy it when the presence of God falls. I enjoy it. But you know, one day I'll be sitting here thinking that the presence of God has fall if I'm not careful and he's already raptured the church and I'll be preaching about him and I'll be praying to him and I'll be worshiping and singing songs and getting the getting the good feelings in the body and he'll have raptured the church already &gt;&gt; cuz I'm looking for the wrong thing. The Holy Spirit's here working AS A SON OF MAN THROUGH HIS CHURCH. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOING TO YOU SAY, "WELL, when I what?" Show me the evidence of it. &gt;&gt; Show me the evidence of it. &gt;&gt; I've saved it. Sorry, brother. &gt;&gt; I'll just show you the promise of it. &gt;&gt; That is correct. &gt;&gt; See, I can't I can't show Listen, I can't It's not a public thing. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; It's not a public show. It's a oneonone. &gt;&gt; See, for for all for for years, for I think we're just we're we're it's right here. No, just it Well, I don't Let me just show you this. This is what he says. &gt;&gt; SHOW ME THAT HOLY Ghost and then I'll believe it. They told Jesus the same thing. &gt;&gt; Well, raise somebody from the dead. &gt;&gt; And he said, "If I did it, you wouldn't believe me if I did it right in front of you." And many people will say, "Well, show me THE HOLY GHOST. SHOW ME THE same God and William Brandon working today in the church." I could show it to you. And if you're not looking for it, you wouldn't believe it. &gt;&gt; But you know what I can show you? Well, this is what he said right here. See, he said right here in the Bible that that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead, IF IT DWELLS IN YOU, WILL QUICKEN YOUR MORTAL BODY IN spite of you having an enemy telling you otherwise. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and and preachers should be Oh, I've gone I' I've gone so past my time. Can I read you one other thing? Preachers, this is what ministers need to be. And not just ministers, ministers of the home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're waiting for a minister on Wednesday and Sunday and Wednesday and Sunday, you're missing out on ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; PUT ON A TAPE. READ YOUR BIBLE. I I'M talking to me now. Minister to your children. Minister to your parents' children. Minister to your parents. You know, sometimes it takes I don't this is not in notes, but I'm just Sometimes it takes a little child coming up to you and saying, "Where are we going to read our Bible tonight?" for an adult who's supposed to be grown up in the word, a grown-up believer to go, "You're right. I had kind of forgotten about it." &gt;&gt; It takes a little child sometimes to remind you, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid, little children, to stand upon the word of God. I don't care if you understand that much. It doesn't matter. It's more powerful than every devil in hell to understand this much of who God is and to put it into action. I've just I'm all over the place. Look how the church uh can Can we handle this quote? &gt;&gt; How the church ought to look this morning to find the spirit working amongst the people. If you want a church home where the spirit that raised Christ FROM THE DEAD, THE HOLY Spirit will move amongst the people. First, you got to ask yourself, do you want that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. I do. &gt;&gt; Well, that's the question. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; You know why that's the question? Because in order to have that, &gt;&gt; you cannot have ownership. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, ownership of this and ownership of this and ownership of this and ownership of what this does and what these look at is so hard to give up to somebody else. That will move some other people. That's the spirit that God is raising up in the last days to take the people over into the other land into THE FULL PROMISE OF ALL THE BLESSINGS OF GOD AND TO THE FULL COMMISSION that he gave or the promise when the devil will tell you, "Yeah, you can have healing just not for that thing." I'm sorry, that's not the full promise that I was given. I WAS GIVEN THE FULL PROMISE OF GOD. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND HAVE THAT CHILD, but this one over here is a little bit too far gone. I'm sorry, BUT THAT'S NOT THE FULL PROMISE. TAKE THE DEVIL back to the word, wave the little piece of paper, and say, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T HAVE THEM BACK RIGHT NOW, BUT I HAVE A PROMISE that I'm going to wave in front OF YOU, AND THE PROMISE IS JUST AS GOOD. &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST AS good as having them." I didn't even finish that other quote about the token. There is a land. IT'S THE PROMISED LAND. LOOK AT PEOPLE went over into THE PROMISED LAND. 12 SPIES went over and only two came back and said, "We can do it." And the other 10 talked about, "Oh, well, the cancer's really hard over there. The anxiety is really hard over there." &gt;&gt; Anybody? The depression's really hard over there. Oh, the temptation of sin. It's really hard over there. Maybe it's just better that we stay here with our bread and our quail. And the enemy will say, "Oh, well, it's good bread. It's from God." Amen. It's good quail. It's from God. Amen. Wandering around in the desert. But to cross over that Jordan, there has to be a death. If you say, "Brother, I've died. I I used to do this and now I don't do that." That's good. I'm not doubting anybody's thing. THERE HAS TO IT'S NOT A LAND. The promised land is not a land of a halfway surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a land of full surrender. Achen crossed over. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; And never fully surrendered his wealth, his plans, his riches, his material goods, his ownership. &gt;&gt; He never fully surrendered. And it cost them. &gt;&gt; As uh the promise is unto you and to your children. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to claim that. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. As Israel sought for that promised land knowing it was somewhere because there had been somebody there. &gt;&gt; I love that. Before so is the church. We know that there's a land somewhere. There is a power somewhere because there's been others over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I'm not going off of the theory. I HAVE HOLY [screaming] GHOST FILILLED witnesses to TELL ME, "OH, YEAH, THERE'S uh giants." I mean, yeah, there's giants, but we BEAT THEM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GREATER IS HE THAT'S WITH US THAN THE I MEAN, WE'RE MORE THAN ABLE TO TAKE THAT LAND. I I'M SO TIRED OF A REPORT COMING BACK SAYING THE giants are too big for us. Maybe we should just stay here safe in our camp. YOU KNOW, I'M I YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY HAVE I I just love this. I I've I've gone so much. Will you forgive me? I I I YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE GRAPES over here on our side. You you look at these grapes that we got in Egypt. LOOK AT LOOK AT THESE GRAPES WE GOT. I GOT THE Holy Spirit. Look at this grapes. YOU'VE NEVER HAD IT like it's over there in the promised land. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOMEBODY COMING BACK OVER THERE AND SAYING, "OH, YOU GRAPES. That little thing. Try this one right here. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT THAT LITTLE HOLY SPIRIT. OH, THAT'S GOOD. HEY, THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. I'M NOT DOWNPLAYING THE HOLY SPIRIT." BUT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SCRATCHED THE SURFACE OF WHAT GOD CAN DO FOR YOU, WHAT HE WANTS TO DO FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; OH MAN, I PRAYED to him and he took this THIS HEADACHE AWAY. IT'S NOT EVEN SCRATCHING THIS. I'M NOT DOWNPLAYING the Lord. I'm telling you, IT'S THE SURFACE OF WHAT HE WANTS TO do for you. God is telling you, you think you've HAD GRAPES. OH, I GOT GRAPES that two men can't carry. &gt;&gt; What is it GOING TO TAKE? YOU GOT TO GIVE UP THOSE GRAPES to come and get these ones. Amen. &gt;&gt; Give me ownership. &gt;&gt; GIVE ME OWNERSHIP. I'LL TAKE YOU INTO A LAND YOU'LL WANT FOR NOTHING. &gt;&gt; Will it be hard? Yeah. Battles? Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Will you get injured? Yes. WILL YOU GET SCARRED? YES. BUT I'M SO TIRED OF I'M I'M SO TIRED of a religion THAT TELLS ME I'M GOING TO GO INTO A RAPTURE DEFEATED. I'M going to crawl into the No, I'm sorry. I'M NOT. I'M GOING TO BE VICTORIOUS going into THIS RAPTURE. I I'M NOT telling you I'm NOT GOING TO HAVE SCARS. I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU I'M NOT GOING TO BE MISSING A LIMB. I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU I'M NOT GOING TO have wounds. But I'm going into this rapture victorious &gt;&gt; because that's what Christ does. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; Christ did not ascend into heaven defeated. &gt;&gt; HE HAD HUNG. HE DIED. HE resurrected with scars in his HAND AND STILL HAD THE POWER TO ASCEND INTO HEAVEN. THAT'S HOW I'M GOING in the rapture. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND ANY CHURCH, ANY RELIGION, ANY PREACHER, even the enemy inside, especially that one that tells you it's anything other than that, is false. &gt;&gt; And that's the enemy you need to take out and either kill or pray for it. Make it one of you or it will separate itself from you. &gt;&gt; Take that enemy to church. &gt;&gt; You want to get rid of the enemy, take it to church. Oh yeah, you can tell me this. You can tell me this. But listen to this. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you okay? You'll have your say. You'll have your say. You can tell me this. But my God says this. [applause] &gt;&gt; Stick around. You know what, SATAN? IF YOU WANT TO STICK around and plague my mind with an enemy, you know what you're going to be doing, Satan? You're going to be worshiping cuz I'm going to go worship. &gt;&gt; And if Satan wants to stick around and sing Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, then he'll stick around and sing it. If he wants to plague my mind, then he's going to be singing praises to the Lord, but he won't want to. And you know what he'll do? He'll depart from you. &gt;&gt; Yes, he will. &gt;&gt; Now, maybe he'll meet you outside the door. But when praises come off your lips continually, WHEN PRAYER COMES OFF YOUR YOU KNOW WHAT, SATAN? IF YOU WANT TO STICK AROUND, YOU'RE GOING TO BE in my prayer today. &gt;&gt; You want to pray to the Lord about how great he is. You want to tell him how good he is, he can't stand that. He can't stand hearing how good the Lord is. He'll depart from you and flee from you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua knew there was a land there. &gt;&gt; Yeah, HE DID. &gt;&gt; HE WENT FIRST and found out. &gt;&gt; We got a God who went and found out. HE WENT AND FOUND OUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO SUFFER, what it was like to die, what it was like to be buried, and what it was like to raise up again. And he's telling you, "Oh, I've been there. Come with me." God called ministers ought to not be so stuffed with theology. Amen. but have visit the land to where WE'RE GOING, BRINGING BACK EVIDENCE of divine love and power of Jesus CHRIST TO MAKE KNOWN TO THEIR CONGREGATION THAT THERE IS A LAND &gt;&gt; BEYOND the river &gt;&gt; I got to stop. That's what the ministers, not just listen, &gt;&gt; NOT JUST BEHIND this pullpit, &gt;&gt; YOU OUGHT TO BE TELLING your family, your spouse, and especially the person in the mirror. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. There is a land &gt;&gt; where you DON'T HAVE OWNERSHIP. IF YOU WANT TO GO INTO THAT LAND, you're going to become as one of those giants. You're going to become as Jericho. You're going to become as one of those cities. YOU'RE GOING TO FALL. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT to minister SOMETIMES TO YOURSELF, BUT OBVIOUSLY surround yourself by ministers who are saying, "Well, uh, it's nice over there, &gt;&gt; but there's some giants. I don't want to have a minister, &gt;&gt; I don't want to have a minister telling me that." &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know what? You know why it's so deceiving, Brother Curry? Is because there are giants over there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. &gt;&gt; There are real I don't want I don't want some fairy tale painted out before me. But Joshua and Caleb said, "Oh, yeah, they're giants." Yeah, we're more than able. &gt;&gt; We are more than able. &gt;&gt; It's not to It's not just to build up our emotion. Let's be realistic. We got some We got some enemy to defeat right here. You're more than able to I I have to stop. Amen. Let's just stand. I I I want to I got far too much to keep going. I have taken an extra 10 minutes, 12 minutes. Can I I'm going to read the last of this quote. I said I wasn't. I'm going to as you stand. Like brother Dick said, I said I was closing. [snorts] Now Joshua knew. Okay. Sorry. Last night preaching going up to Jordan. Now when we get to that river, it divides us. It separates us. Once on the other side, something's happened to you. You don't have to separate. He'll do it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll do it for you. Now Joshua in all this knowing that the command was great but having the assurance he could be fearless. &gt;&gt; He could be as we call it reckless. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME you were told you can be reckless? &gt;&gt; Oh, no. No. You need to be be careful with your faith. I'm sorry. I'm just going to have faith for everything I think I need to have it for. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be reckless. as long as he was pointed the right way. He might break up against a hill that would knock him down backwards. The Lord will straighten you out if you're pointed the wrong way. &gt;&gt; But he was carried THE RIGHT WAY. SO CAN the church &gt;&gt; of the living God be reckless and fearless in faith if we're pointed the right way. For he said, "As I was with Moses, I'll be with you. I'll not fail you nor forsake you." He never forsaken Moses. He never failed Moses. He didn't fail Joshua and he won't fail you. &gt;&gt; But I think it's time I we need to get reckless and fearless in faith. [music] &gt;&gt; You know what the worst thing could happen is John? I could have faith in the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; And the Lord will go, "You know what? Actually, that was my way. Just leave that one alone." Okay, Lord. Your will be done, not mine. [music] Instead, well, let me pick and choose when I'm going to have some faith and well, I don't know about that one. And maybe I'll put it over here. Be reckless. I I just love that. See, in the with with God, there's freedom. &gt;&gt; There's freedom. &gt;&gt; There's freedom. What should I put my faith in today, Lord? Lord, what would you have me believe today, Lord? WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE me claim today, Lord? What piece of paper do you want to give me today, LORD? WHAT CAN I TAKE THIS TOKEN TODAY, LORD, and wave it over? You know what? I see my brother. I see my sister, and they're down. I'M GOING TO WAVE THIS TOKEN THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME.
