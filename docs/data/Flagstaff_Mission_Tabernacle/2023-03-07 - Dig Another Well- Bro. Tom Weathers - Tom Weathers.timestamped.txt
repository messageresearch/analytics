[0:21] Ike had a blessing from the Lord up
[0:24] above gave him a beautiful woman to love
[0:28] a place to live in some land to farm two
[0:32] good legs and two good arms
[0:36] now the devil came sneaking around one
[0:39] night thought he would do a little evil
[0:42] to Ike thought he'd hit pulled like
[0:45] where it hurts so he filled up all of
[0:48] Ike's Wells with dirt
[0:51] and when I got up for his morning drink
[0:54] he got a Dipper full of dirt his heart
[0:57] did sink but he knew it was the devil so
[0:59] he said with a grin
[1:03] God blessed me once and he'll do it
[1:06] again bless me once and he'll do it
[1:09] again
[1:12] so when the rain don't fall and the
[1:14] crops all fail and the cows ain't
[1:17] putting any milk in the pail don't sit
[1:19] around waiting for a check in the mail

[1:51] get a Dipper full of dirt my heart does
[1:54] sink but I think of old I can I say with
[1:57] a grin
