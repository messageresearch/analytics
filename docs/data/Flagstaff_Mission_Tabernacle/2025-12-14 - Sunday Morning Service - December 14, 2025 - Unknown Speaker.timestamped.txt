[19:48] [singing]
[19:53] [singing]
[20:03] [music]
[20:08] Amen. Amen. How much that [music] song
[20:11] means to each one of us in our own
[20:13] personal way. Amen. Amen. Brother Ryan,
[20:19] you were singing, you were playing the
[20:20] little song, All That's Really True. And
[20:23] what a wonderful, wonderful thought it
[20:26] is. [music]
[20:27] Amen. All that's really true.
[20:30] Amen.
[20:35] No. [music]
[20:38] All that really counts,
[20:42] all that's really [music] true.
[20:45] [singing]
[20:47] All that really matters, Lord, is you.
[20:56] [music]
[20:56] Everything. [singing]
[21:01] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[21:05] [music]
[21:06] [singing]
[21:10] [music]
[21:11] Yeah.
[21:13] Heat.
[21:16] [music and singing]
[21:21] [singing]
[21:22] [music]
[21:24] Oh,
[21:31] [music]
[21:34] [singing]
[21:38] [music]
[21:49] Amen. didn't have any prayer requests
[21:51] this [music] morning, but I know we have
[21:52] needs. Uh, Brother Glenn be in the
[21:55] hospital for a few more hours, it sounds
[21:57] like, until
[21:59] uh, if I have that right, Brother
[22:01] [music] Tim, I don't know most recent
[22:04] message that came out, but sounds like
[22:05] he'll [music] be there a few more hours.
[22:07] Sister Karen had to take him in last
[22:09] night with very, very high blood
[22:11] pressure and they gave him medicine
[22:14] and came down is the good news. and Lord
[22:19] willing, he'll be released soon. So, and
[22:21] I haven't got an update on Sister Vivian
[22:23] this morning, but [music] it's very
[22:24] critical. We'll know by tomorrow the
[22:27] family will have to take her off the
[22:28] ventilator and then she's in the Lord's
[22:31] hands anyway, but uh so it's a very
[22:34] difficult time for uh that family.
[22:38] Is there any other requests that I'm
[22:40] missing that we need to make known?
[22:44] Sister Cindy, of course,
[22:48] Mark Buchanan. Thank you, brother Tim. I
[22:50] went and [music] saw him after seeing
[22:52] Sister Vivian in the hospital. His
[22:54] spirits were good. So, we want to
[22:56] remember brother Mark. [music]
[22:58] Satan's trying to go after him and we
[23:01] just don't accept that. And like the
[23:02] quote on Wednesday night that we read,
[23:05] Brother Brandham said, "We got the power
[23:07] to loose the people from the bondage of
[23:10] the illnesses afflicting them." So let's
[23:13] bow our heads and claim that this
[23:14] morning. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just
[23:16] are reliant so much on your word, Lord.
[23:19] And it's not even how we feel, Lord.
[23:23] It's not the what the doctors say. It's
[23:26] not what they say, Lord. It's not what
[23:28] we feel. It's not the circumstances.
[23:31] It's [music] not the emotions.
[23:33] But Lord, it's your word.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing, Lord. That's what
[23:37] really matters. And we apply that
[23:40] [music] word this morning to those
[23:42] situations, Lord. And Sister Cindy,
[23:44] Sister Vivian,
[23:46] Lord, she's in a very critical situation
[23:49] right now, Lord. She's in intensive
[23:51] [music] care, but may that intensive
[23:53] care be the intensive care of the Lord
[23:56] Jesus this morning, Lord. Not only for
[23:58] her, but for her family. Lord, for
[24:00] Brother Glenn, he's in the emergency
[24:02] room. And may the room that he's in be
[24:05] the room of the Lord Jesus Christ, Lord.
[24:07] And may you be allowed into every room
[24:08] in his heart this morning. And may if
[24:11] there's an emergency, Lord, may you be
[24:13] the one that meets [music] the emergent
[24:15] need that our brother has, Lord Jesus.
[24:18] And the different Lord, brother Mark
[24:19] Buchanan, Lord, he finds himself also in
[24:22] that situation. Maybe in the hospital,
[24:24] but Lord, you're the almighty healer.
[24:27] You're the powerful
[24:29] one with authority, Lord, that you've
[24:31] also put into your church, Lord. You've
[24:33] given us authority, not the power, Lord.
[24:36] We might be like the 150 lb policemen,
[24:40] Lord, that could stand there, but with
[24:42] the authority to bind the devils, Lord,
[24:46] that are trying to afflict the saints
[24:48] and to loose the saints from under that
[24:51] bondage that Satan is trying to put us
[24:52] under. [music] Lord, we apply that in
[24:54] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[24:56] apply your your healing, your salvation,
[24:58] Lord, to those that would be in need
[25:00] this morning, Lord, for every hand or
[25:02] every heart that would raise up this
[25:04] morning and have a need. They just might
[25:06] be thinking in their mind of something
[25:07] in this moment, Lord, that they have you
[25:10] to come by. They need you to come by and
[25:12] to visit them, Lord. Would you come by
[25:14] this morning, Lord? Would you come by
[25:15] and visit me and Brother Donald, the
[25:17] musicians, Lord? Every member of the
[25:20] congregation, Lord, as their thoughts
[25:22] turn to you, they we put aside the
[25:24] world, we leave it outside this morning,
[25:26] Lord. We bring all of our [music]
[25:28] thoughts, Lord. Every every portion of
[25:30] our being, Lord, our physical bodies,
[25:32] all of our emotions we place under your
[25:34] subjection this morning, [music] Lord.
[25:36] We're subject to you. Use us how you
[25:38] would have to use us this morning, Lord.
[25:40] Be with us. The songs and the worship
[25:43] and the fellowship. May you be
[25:44] glorified, magnified. May you be praised
[25:47] this morning. [music]
[25:48] We ask these things in the name of the
[25:50] Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Lord
[25:53] bless you.
[25:55] Amen. Greet the one next to you. You may
[25:57] be seated. Amen. Amen.
[26:02] It's good to see each one of you
[26:05] musicians.
[26:07] Lord bless you. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[26:14] My heart's just uh joyful. Um
[26:19] this old world can never hold me.
[26:23] [snorts]
[26:24] Kim and I were uh starting off and I
[26:27] tell you that uh we talked on a deep
[26:30] subject real quickly, character.
[26:33] So we spent a little bit of time that
[26:35] and I thought each one has their own
[26:38] testimony and uh
[26:42] my character is such that this old world
[26:45] will never hold me. That's truly what I
[26:48] see long time ago. And Donald Robert,
[26:50] you'll forgive me. You're a dear friend
[26:52] and also a loved brother. And but uh the
[26:56] character of Donald Robert, he has a and
[26:59] I'm going use him as an example. Each
[27:01] one use it. He has a business that it
[27:04] would be real easy to take and just
[27:07] shade things just a little bit. Just
[27:10] make things gray because the law is such
[27:13] that he has a reason to an ability to to
[27:16] to interpret it how he wants to. Years
[27:19] ago, brother Jim said came to me and we
[27:22] were talking and he goes, "You know,
[27:23] Donald,
[27:25] Donald just is either black or white.
[27:29] There's no in between. [snorts] his
[27:31] character. Now, does he have to fight
[27:33] the circumstance? Yes.
[27:36] But we have this moment in time. We have
[27:38] this brief moment in time to let our
[27:40] characters just come out today. There's
[27:43] no black or white. I'm going to make it.
[27:46] This old world can never hold me. Amen.
[27:50] Oh, this old world
[27:54] will never hold me
[27:57] anymore. [music] Heat.

[30:29] some more days are just it's bubbling in

[30:34] come out in that way. Amen. Sister
[30:37] Naomi, you have is it family sitting
[30:39] back beside you? Just friends.
[30:43] Well, Lord bless you. You know, you're
[30:46] on the back row, but you're more than
[30:48] welcome to move up front if you want to
[30:50] do it, too. Amen. Amen. We see Brother
[30:54] Will, you brought your mother-in-law
[30:55] again. Lord bless you. Amen. I've got
[30:59] the love of Jesus. [music] Love of
[31:02] Jesus.
[31:08] [music and singing]
[31:14] [music]
[31:16] Oh,

[32:21] [singing]
[32:26] [singing]
[32:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[32:33] [music]
[32:34] &gt;&gt; So very happy [singing]
[32:41] in [music and singing] my heart.
[32:45] Amen.
[32:46] Amen. I'm happy this morning. Amen.
[32:50] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. In
[32:55] that city where the lamb is the light.
[32:58] Amen. I uh I live a life just like you.
[33:02] And I say this not so much for the older
[33:04] ones, but they know, but for the younger
[33:07] ones. So I say fight the same battles
[33:09] you do. Maybe just a little bit
[33:12] different age, but still the same
[33:14] battles. And all it comes down to is
[33:16] Satan's trying to get me just to tweak
[33:19] my thinking just a little bit. So that's
[33:21] all the big things. He won't do it
[33:22] there. But I was uh
[33:26] my grandson my grandson is is a sorry
[33:30] Chase. He's a Dalton. That would be
[33:34] Oliver. He has the last name of Wilson.
[33:37] But the young man is a Dalton. And the
[33:39] Dalton don't know how to do anything but
[33:41] praise God. And I say that with great
[33:44] respect. Please understand that
[33:47] to the shame of myself sometimes.
[33:51] He was out there. his mom Mimo took him
[33:54] and the whole family and they were doing
[33:56] something and he came up to his mimo and
[33:58] he says, "Mimo, I met somebody new and
[34:01] he loves Jesus."
[34:05] Now I'm going to present it to you. How
[34:08] many has gone up to somebody kid or
[34:12] young person or whatever else and in
[34:14] five minutes time can say he loved
[34:18] Jesus?
[34:20] My point is that's a dollar.
[34:24] And with great respect.
[34:28] So I may not be able to, but I'm going
[34:31] to tell you about a heaven I'm planning
[34:33] on going to. That's what I want to sing
[34:36] about. This same Jesus that that little
[34:39] boy asked this little boy, "Do you know
[34:43] Jesus?" "Yeah, I know Jesus." That's all
[34:46] that mattered to him. He didn't make any
[34:48] big deal about it. Jerry, where do you
[34:50] go to church? What are you saying? He
[34:52] said, do you know Jesus? That's simple
[34:55] enough for me. I mean, there's a country
[34:58] far beyond. There's a country far beyond
[35:03] the [singing]
[35:03] starry [music] sky.
[35:06] Oh,

[44:06] uh to be sung. Um,
[44:10] I woke up the other morning, Cammy, what
[44:12] was the name of that song? Um,
[44:18] no. Um, Sister Mary, uh,
[44:22] Huh?
[44:26] Yes.
[44:27] The Hallelujah square. How many
[44:30] remembers that song? I see two hands.
[44:35] Jerry, I saw a little sister Mary used
[44:37] to sing it. I see dad's hand. Hallelujah
[44:40] square. Have you ever heard that one?
[44:43] Anyways, this is what I grew up with.
[44:47] This is this is my life. I know nothing
[44:50] else. She used to sing this little song
[44:53] and and we may not have it and it's not
[44:55] there and um that's and a lot of it's uh
[45:00] so if we don't have it, it's all right.
[45:01] But uh
[45:04] this blind man, you know what? Put the
[45:05] words up there. And brother Ryan, is as
[45:08] we're just um
[45:13] would you mind uh just playing the
[45:15] little chorus uh Amazing Grace?
[45:22] This song,
[45:25] the words, uh I'll let you read it to
[45:27] you young people. Um, I saw a blind man
[45:31] tapping along, losing his way as he
[45:34] passed through the throne.
[45:38] Tears filled my eyes.
[45:41] Sorry, Sister Pauline.
[45:45] If you can go back down just so I can
[45:46] see it.
[45:49] Tears filled my eyes. I said, "Friend,
[45:51] you can't see."
[45:56] I'll let sister Pauline
[45:59] get through. We're to the first one. But
[46:02] anyways, the
[46:05] we I don't have that and I'm [music]
[46:07] sorry, sister Pauline. But anyways, this
[46:09] little story, this little song,
[46:12] Amazing Grace, is it? And I heard Sister
[46:15] Mary sing it and I woke up hurting the
[46:18] other morning. I'm telling you that this
[46:20] for a a point that we have a God that
[46:23] we're approaching. We've done everything
[46:24] we know to do. We've sung. We've placed
[46:28] our hearts. Each one of us is a
[46:29] responsibility of our hearts being clean
[46:33] and pure. [music] And if there was
[46:34] anything wrong to ask him to forgive us.
[46:37] But this little song, I woke up this
[46:38] morning, the other morning, and as you
[46:40] all know, years ago, I fell and hurt my
[46:43] ankle. And the Lord saw fit to to let me
[46:46] walk. But here in the mornings, it it
[46:48] still it hurts. And sometimes it catches
[46:51] and sometimes I've got to hold on to the
[46:53] wall. And this song, I don't know why it
[46:56] came to my mind. Uh, and it talks about
[47:00] number one, a a blind man can't see.
[47:06] And he tells the story. He says, "I feel
[47:08] sorry for you, blind man. You got
[47:10] problems."
[47:13] And he says, "Don't feel sorry for me.
[47:15] One of these days
[47:17] I'm going to be in heaven." in
[47:19] Hallelujah Square where there's going to
[47:21] be nothing. He went on to a a crippled
[47:24] man. That's where I found myself in the
[47:27] morning
[47:29] and I couldn't walk. And he said, "Don't
[47:31] feel sorry for me."
[47:33] He says, "I'm going to place that none
[47:36] of this will bother me anymore." At this
[47:39] point, I thought of you, Dad.
[47:42] Thought of Sister Alberta.
[47:45] I thought of those that are maybe in a
[47:48] circumstance that they can't help
[47:49] themselves. It don't matter. We're going
[47:52] to a Hallelujah square.
[47:54] That's my hope. That's my dream. That's
[47:56] amazing grace.
[48:00] So I went back and I thought, Lord,
[48:02] where does this song come from? Where
[48:04] does the inspiration come from? Did the
[48:05] man see it? Did he see somebody? And
[48:08] that's how I always assumed he saw
[48:10] somebody and he felt bad for him walking
[48:12] along the street. The reality of it, it
[48:15] was none of those things. He'd gone
[48:18] through a massive heart attack. This was
[48:20] back in the 40. He had bypasses.
[48:22] So himself, he was blind. He couldn't
[48:25] see. He came out of it in a stroke.
[48:28] Couldn't walk.
[48:30] So he's encouraging himself.
[48:33] I see a blind man. I see a hope man. I
[48:36] see somebody that's imperfect. But I
[48:38] look beyond what I see right now. What I
[48:41] see sitting in my chairs. And I'm
[48:43] looking to the God of heaven that showed
[48:46] me amazing grace that he's going to
[48:48] speak to me and he's going to help me
[48:50] just make one more step. But I'm going
[48:53] to get there and I'm going to shout
[48:55] hallelujah on that hallelujah square. If
[48:58] there is such a thing, I have no idea.
[49:00] But it brings my thoughts.
[49:03] And that's what it did. That's what
[49:06] we're here for. We each one carry
[49:08] problems.
[49:10] I carry probably I [music] wouldn't want
[49:13] your problems, but I carry my own
[49:15] problems.
[49:18] Sister Leslie, if I don't look past
[49:21] that, if I just concentrate on my
[49:25] problems, I'll miss out on [music] what
[49:28] God has done for me. So, Amazing Grace,
[49:31] as we stand and sing this song as a
[49:34] pastor comes, Amazing Grace,
[49:37] maybe sing it in a way that you've shut
[49:40] the doors and
[49:43] it's just you and him. And you're
[49:45] telling him, "Amazing grace,
[49:50] amazing
[49:53] [music] grace,
[49:56] how sweet [music]
[49:59] the sound
[50:08] like Yeah. [music]
[50:11] [singing]
[50:14] Heat.

[51:11] [music]
[51:19] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[51:22] &gt;&gt; to
[51:25] bless you this morning. Happy to be in
[51:26] the house of the Lord and greet you once
[51:28] again in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:30] Christ. If you have your Bibles, we'll
[51:32] turn to First Kings
[51:35] chapter 17. First Kings 17. Who is the
[51:38] brother in the back there? Do we know?
[51:43] Is that brother
[51:46] Paulo
[51:52] Manuelas?
[51:57] Brother Manuel is pastors a church here
[52:01] in town by NAU on Ori Street.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[52:08] And um this week we had an opportunity
[52:11] to meet him and spoke with him at a
[52:14] funeral
[52:16] and um
[52:18] and yeah, just a wonderful spirit. God
[52:21] bless you, brother. And we're happy to
[52:22] have you with us. Praise the Lord. I
[52:25] thought that was you. I just couldn't.
[52:27] It's the distance, brother. So, praise
[52:30] the Lord. First Kings 17
[52:33] and we'll read the first seven verses.
[52:38] Bible says, "And Elijah the Tishbite,
[52:40] who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
[52:42] said unto Ahab, as the Lord God of
[52:46] Israel liveth, before whom I stand,
[52:49] there shall not be due nor rain these
[52:51] years, but according to my word." The
[52:55] word of the Lord came unto him, saying,
[52:57] Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward,
[52:59] and hide thyself by the brook Cherith,
[53:03] that is before Jordan. And it shall be
[53:06] that thou shalt drink of the brook, and
[53:07] I have commanded the ravens to feed thee
[53:10] there. So he went and did according unto
[53:13] the word of the Lord. For he went and
[53:16] dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is
[53:18] before Jordan. And the ravens brought
[53:20] him bread and flesh in the morning, and
[53:23] bread and flesh in the evening. And he
[53:27] drank of the brook. And it came to pass
[53:29] after a while that the brook dried up
[53:32] because there had been no rain in the
[53:34] land. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[53:36] Father, we we bow before you this
[53:38] morning, Lord. We're just at your mercy,
[53:41] Father. And we thank you for your word
[53:43] as we've read it. We know it's blessed.
[53:44] It's anointed, Lord. And your word very
[53:48] word teaches us that it will not return
[53:50] void, but it will establish. It will
[53:53] have a purpose, and that purpose will
[53:55] not be defeated. So, we thank you for
[53:57] that this morning. We accept it in the
[53:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ be with us
[54:00] this morning Lord in spirit be with us
[54:03] in truth Jesus name we pray. Amen. You
[54:06] can be seated and in the message
[54:11] spiritual food in due season. Brother
[54:14] Brandon preaches it the July 18th of 65.
[54:18] And that morning he preaches uh trying
[54:21] to do God a service without it being in
[54:23] his will. The next Sunday he preaches
[54:25] anointed ones at the end time and what's
[54:28] the attraction on the mountain. And so
[54:29] in this middle of these very powerful
[54:33] section of sermons he preaches spiritual
[54:35] food in due season. And he uses these
[54:38] very seven verses to minister this
[54:41] message.
[54:43] And in these verses there's nothing
[54:45] about food in due season. And so uh but
[54:49] he does use that as a title. And
[54:51] certainly there's a there's a reference
[54:53] to food here and a reference to food in
[54:56] the season when food would be needed.
[54:58] But in Psalms, and you don't have to
[54:59] turn with I would just like to read a
[55:01] few of the verses where the Bible talks
[55:03] about food or meat or something coming
[55:08] from the Lord in the appropriate time,
[55:10] in the appropriate season. In Psalms 104
[55:13] and verse 24, the Bible says, "Oh Lord,
[55:15] how manifold are thy works. In wisdom
[55:18] hast thou made them all. The earth is
[55:20] full of thy riches. So is this great and
[55:23] wide sea wherein things wherein are
[55:26] things creeping, innumerable, both small
[55:29] and great beasts. And the psalmist is
[55:32] writing about perhaps the sea, but how
[55:35] great the works of the Lord are. There's
[55:37] things that are creeping. They're small
[55:38] and they're great. They're they're large
[55:40] and small. There's beasts. And he says,
[55:42] "There go the ships. There's the
[55:44] Leviathan whom thou hast made to play
[55:47] therein. These wait all upon thee that
[55:50] thou mayest give them their meat in due
[55:53] season. And it doesn't matter the size
[55:56] of the beast or the insect or the fish
[55:59] or whatever the foul of the air might be
[56:01] or whatever's in the water. They all
[56:03] wait for God to provide for them
[56:05] something in the appropriate time that
[56:08] they would have need. In Proverbs 15, it
[56:10] says, "Without counsel, purposes are
[56:13] disappointed or purposes are defeated.
[56:15] But in the multitude of counselors those
[56:18] very purposes are established. It said
[56:21] who's excuse me a man that hath the man
[56:24] hath joy by the answer of his mouth and
[56:26] a word spoken in due season. And I like
[56:29] how the word finishes here. How good is
[56:31] it? It's almost like saying there's
[56:33] nothing better than when you need
[56:35] something from the Lord and maybe you've
[56:37] thought that you had an idea or you had
[56:39] plans or you had counselors and you
[56:42] wanted to go a certain direction but
[56:44] then you would you would seek counsel
[56:45] and by the m multitude of counselors
[56:47] wisdom might come to you and and a man
[56:50] has joy by the answer of his mouth and
[56:52] if there's a word that God gives you
[56:53] this morning maybe God would just speak
[56:55] one word that but it's the very word
[56:57] that you had need of this morning and
[56:59] you have need of a word and I don't know
[57:00] what you need and and and brother Donna,
[57:02] none of us know what the word that you
[57:04] need is, but God knows. Now, how good
[57:07] would it be if you have need of a word,
[57:08] you have need of a nourishment of
[57:10] something, and God gives you that thing
[57:12] that the the the psalm the the person
[57:14] who writes the proverbs here, Solomon
[57:16] perhaps would say, "How good is that
[57:18] word?" You know, when you're craving uh
[57:22] like Sister Dette, she won't mind me
[57:23] saying this, but when she wants a
[57:25] Coca-Cola, she doesn't want it to taste
[57:27] bad. She doesn't want it to be watered
[57:29] down. She doesn't want it, you know, to
[57:31] not have enough ice. She likes it cold.
[57:33] She likes it from McDonald's, you know.
[57:35] She wants it in a small cup, lots of
[57:37] ice. And if she has a need or a desire
[57:40] for that very thing, her body wants
[57:41] that, you know, it's a nourishment. And
[57:43] how good is that when when you could
[57:45] just put that, you know, just to your
[57:46] lips and begin to drink it. Now, if
[57:48] that's a natural nourishment and your
[57:50] body goes, "Oh, how good is it?" Well,
[57:52] this morning, God has ability to give
[57:54] you a spiritual nourishment of the very
[57:56] nourishment that you have need of. Not
[57:59] that I think you need, not that a pastor
[58:01] might have an idea that the congregation
[58:03] needs, but God knows what each and every
[58:05] person has need of, and he's able to
[58:07] provide that. Matthew 24 says,
[58:09] "Therefore, be ye also ready, for in
[58:11] such an hour as you think not, the Son
[58:14] of man cometh." Who then is a faithful
[58:16] and wise servant whom the Lord hath made
[58:19] ruler over his household to give them
[58:21] meat in due season. So God has rulers
[58:24] over his household, and they're called
[58:26] servants in this case. And brother
[58:27] Brandon would say it like this that the
[58:29] buzzards or excuse me the ravens that
[58:31] would feed Elijah, he said those were
[58:34] the very servants. And he said bless
[58:36] those ravens in one place that they gave
[58:38] food to the prophet. And so the prophet
[58:41] needed food. And here was a servant. And
[58:43] a servant doesn't know what the what the
[58:45] people need. He just knows he's directed
[58:47] by God and and he goes and tries to find
[58:50] a sandwich. And who knows where the
[58:52] ravens got those sandwiches. It doesn't
[58:53] matter. But brother Brandham says that
[58:55] they brought Elijah the sandwiches
[58:57] morning and night just exactly what he
[58:59] had need of. And so God is able today,
[59:02] you have a need this morning to give you
[59:04] a spiritual food in the very season that
[59:07] you have need of it. Now what happens
[59:10] here in this story is Elijah, these are
[59:12] the very first words that the very first
[59:14] time that Elijah is even mentioned in
[59:17] the Bible here. Here it just comes.
[59:19] Elijah, he was of the inhabitants of
[59:21] Gilead, said unto Ahab. There's no
[59:25] mention of where Elijah came from. It
[59:28] doesn't mention his lineage like Joseph.
[59:29] You know, he was born in a household his
[59:31] father loved him and made him a coat and
[59:33] then his brothers didn't like him and
[59:34] and and they put him in a pit and sold
[59:36] it. None of that for Elijah. Nothing
[59:39] like, you know, Abraham came from a
[59:41] household where his father made idols or
[59:44] or Moses was raised and he was put in a
[59:46] basket when he was a young boy or, you
[59:48] know, Noah had this up. None of that for
[59:50] Elijah. His very first time he's
[59:52] mentioned is right here in King 17. He
[59:55] just comes out of nowhere. And the very
[59:57] first words that he says and he says
[59:59] them to Ahab, he says, "Listen, you're
[1:00:01] doing wrong. You're sinning. And because
[1:00:03] you're doing that, there's not going to
[1:00:05] be due or rain these years, but
[1:00:08] according to my word. Now, how bad could
[1:00:10] Ahab have been that the very first words
[1:00:13] that the prophet of God would speak to
[1:00:14] him would be, listen, there's not going
[1:00:16] to be rain. And not only not going to be
[1:00:18] rain. Rain is not, you know, we're in a
[1:00:20] drought and that's something and it's
[1:00:21] really bad and certainly we want to see
[1:00:23] some snow next week. How many? A couple
[1:00:25] of us probably. I want Lake Pal to fill
[1:00:27] up cuz I like to fish, you know. So,
[1:00:29] it's a little uh selfish on my part. But
[1:00:31] listen, we need we're in a drought. But
[1:00:33] how bad would the drought be if there
[1:00:35] was not even any dew on the ground? Like
[1:00:38] that's another level of drought. So, if
[1:00:40] you just go back, so the very first
[1:00:42] thing that Elijah's mentioned is he
[1:00:44] comes out of nowhere and he says there's
[1:00:46] not going to be rain. You never heard of
[1:00:48] him before. No lineage. No, we know he's
[1:00:50] from Tishb, but we don't even know where
[1:00:52] the town Tishb is. I looked it up
[1:00:54] online. It's been a while and there's
[1:00:55] they don't even know where it is today.
[1:00:57] Just came out of nowhere. And then he
[1:00:59] speaks a harsh word to the people.
[1:01:02] The Bible says this just four or five
[1:01:04] verses earlier that Ahab and uh first
[1:01:07] Kings 16. And Ahab said the son of Om
[1:01:10] and Ahab the son of Omry did evil in the
[1:01:12] sight of the Lord above all that were
[1:01:14] before him. And there was a lot of evil
[1:01:16] before him. And it came to pass as if it
[1:01:19] had been a light thing for him to walk
[1:01:20] in the sins of Jeroboam, the son of
[1:01:23] Nabet, that he took to wife Jezebel, the
[1:01:26] daughter of Ethbal, king of the
[1:01:28] Zidonians, and went and served Baal and
[1:01:30] worshiped him. This it wasn't bad enough
[1:01:32] that you walked after Jer. You went and
[1:01:35] married a worshipper of Baal. And then
[1:01:38] you went and served Baal just like your
[1:01:40] wife did. And he reared up an altar for
[1:01:42] Baal and the house of Baal which he had
[1:01:44] built in Samaria. And Ahab made a gro
[1:01:47] and Ahab did more, the Bible says, to
[1:01:49] provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger
[1:01:51] than all the kings of Israel that were
[1:01:54] before him. No wonder a prophet would
[1:01:55] have to come literally out of nowhere
[1:01:58] and provide a curse over the land just
[1:02:00] because of these sins that Ahab did. And
[1:02:02] then the Bible says, "In his days did he
[1:02:05] the Bethlite build Jericho. He laid the
[1:02:09] foundation thereof in Abberam, his
[1:02:12] firstborn, and set up the gates thereof
[1:02:14] in his youngest son, Segub, according to
[1:02:19] the word of the Lord, which he spake by
[1:02:21] Joshua, the son of Nun. What in the
[1:02:25] world is going on there? So this guy,
[1:02:28] the Bethlite, built Jericho. He laid a
[1:02:31] foundation and set up gates according to
[1:02:34] the word of the Lord. And what that is
[1:02:36] saying there is that his firstborn he
[1:02:39] tried to build up Jericho and his
[1:02:41] firstborn died in the foundation thereof
[1:02:44] or in the building of the foundation and
[1:02:47] then his young excuse me and then his
[1:02:49] youngest son died setting up the gates
[1:02:52] thereof as Joshua said. That's what that
[1:02:55] scripture actually means because Joshua
[1:02:57] said that that's what happened. Go to
[1:03:00] Joshua 6:26. Pull that up. And Joshua
[1:03:03] saved Rahab the harlot alive in her
[1:03:04] father's household and all that she had.
[1:03:06] And she dwelleth in Israel, even unto
[1:03:08] this day, because she hid the messengers
[1:03:10] which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
[1:03:13] And Joshua adjured them at that time,
[1:03:15] saying, "Cursed be the man before the
[1:03:18] Lord that riseth up and buildeth this
[1:03:21] city Jericho."
[1:03:23] Now in the days of Ahab, here goes a
[1:03:26] man, and he goes to raise up what God
[1:03:30] has already cursed.
[1:03:32] And Joshua, he continues and he says
[1:03:34] this, he'll lay the foundation in his
[1:03:37] firstborn and his youngest son, he'll
[1:03:39] set the gates up. It's like this that
[1:03:41] that when God sends a word out, that
[1:03:43] word doesn't have an expiration date. So
[1:03:46] if God says something and and the word
[1:03:48] has gone forth, you know, if there was
[1:03:49] an expiration date on a gallon of milk,
[1:03:51] we think nothing of it. You know, it's
[1:03:52] it's going to be good for two weeks and
[1:03:54] maybe it'll go for a couple extra days.
[1:03:56] But when God says that Jericho is cursed
[1:03:59] and don't build up the foundation and
[1:04:01] don't build up the gates, that's what he
[1:04:03] means. And that goes forever. It's been
[1:04:05] a couple hundred years, but the word of
[1:04:07] the go of God stands today. And it's the
[1:04:10] same word that'll stand forever. If you
[1:04:12] know, by his stripes, you're healed.
[1:04:14] Does not have an expiration date. It
[1:04:16] didn't expire in 1965. It didn't expire
[1:04:19] in 1947. But that word [screaming] still
[1:04:22] holds with great value today. if you'll
[1:04:26] accept it, if you'll believe it. All
[1:04:28] right. So now, so now they do this evil
[1:04:31] thing and they try to rebuild a cursed
[1:04:35] city. And now Elijah just comes out of
[1:04:38] nowhere. Brother Bam says this. Now that
[1:04:39] type there that I'm going to type Elijah
[1:04:41] with the church today, the church of
[1:04:44] today, just before judgment, he received
[1:04:48] this message. Elijah, he represented
[1:04:51] being cared for in the natural, his
[1:04:52] natural food, because it wasn't going to
[1:04:54] rain. Now, according to the word of God,
[1:04:56] for three years and six months, or until
[1:04:58] Elijah called for it, whatever time you
[1:05:01] say, Elijah, that's what it'll be.
[1:05:02] Therefore, he walked up to the king and
[1:05:04] said, "There'll not even be due fall
[1:05:06] till I call for it." That's quite a
[1:05:08] load, isn't it? That's quite a message.
[1:05:11] And we have today, saints, we have
[1:05:13] something like this. Quite a message.
[1:05:16] And I'm very thankful for quite a
[1:05:17] message because I don't think I would
[1:05:19] have the courage to stand up here unless
[1:05:21] the prophet of God had stood and cried
[1:05:24] out against every evil in Leodysia. I
[1:05:26] wouldn't be able to stand up here and
[1:05:28] cry out [screaming] like he cried out
[1:05:29] unless he did it first and pave the way
[1:05:32] for you and I to sit under a great
[1:05:34] message. Oh, what a message. It was
[1:05:37] quite a message. And now we're going to
[1:05:40] be that type with the spiritual drought
[1:05:41] of today. We're going to type that. Now,
[1:05:44] we all know, we're all very aware that
[1:05:46] there's a great spiritual drought in the
[1:05:49] land today. Ain't that interesting?
[1:05:52] Spiritually speaking, and you know, that
[1:05:54] was predicted by the prophets just
[1:05:56] before the second coming of Christ would
[1:05:58] be said, there will come a famine in the
[1:06:00] land, and it won't be for bread alone,
[1:06:02] but for the hearing of the word of God.
[1:06:04] And that day is now. And I think that
[1:06:08] day is still now, hearing the true word
[1:06:10] of God. So he gives us a little bit of
[1:06:12] clarification on what that hearing is.
[1:06:14] It's not, you know, just a famine for
[1:06:17] hearing like a part of the word of God.
[1:06:18] And there's many ministers today
[1:06:20] throughout this country that would take
[1:06:22] a portion of the Bible and they would
[1:06:24] begin to speak that portion of the Bible
[1:06:26] and they would leave out what their
[1:06:28] organization doesn't accept in the
[1:06:30] Bible. You know, there's organizations
[1:06:32] who today do not accept divine healing.
[1:06:34] And so the preacher can't preach that.
[1:06:36] And so there's a famine for the hearing
[1:06:38] of divine healing in the land today. And
[1:06:41] there's preachers who fail to preach
[1:06:42] about holiness because, you know, it
[1:06:44] might offend somebody in their church if
[1:06:46] they would say, "Sisters, you better
[1:06:48] dress right. You better dress modestly.
[1:06:50] You better put a skirt on. You better
[1:06:51] have long hair. And it better be long.
[1:06:53] And it not better not be tight." But
[1:06:55] there's a famine for hearing that today.
[1:06:59] There's no hearing of that today in the
[1:07:01] churches. It's just not. There's a
[1:07:03] famine for it except in some places by
[1:07:07] God's grace. Okay? It won't be okay. And
[1:07:10] that day is now. Now this types the
[1:07:12] natural drought with the spiritual sin
[1:07:15] and unbelief by false teachers and
[1:07:17] modernists in the church had brought the
[1:07:19] place to this coming oncoming judgment.
[1:07:22] Then they had turned from God's word and
[1:07:24] his prophet to a modern theological
[1:07:27] terms of the word. It's in Amos chapter
[1:07:29] 8. It says this, "Behold the day come,
[1:07:31] sayaeth the Lord, that I will send a
[1:07:33] famine in the land. not a famine of
[1:07:35] bread, nor a thirst for water, but of
[1:07:38] hearing the words of the Lord. And
[1:07:40] they'll wander from sea to sea and from
[1:07:42] the north to the east, and they shall
[1:07:44] run to and fro and seek the word of the
[1:07:46] Lord, and they will not find it. It's a
[1:07:49] famine. It's a lack of hearing the true
[1:07:52] word. Now, notice what it's not a famine
[1:07:54] of. It's not a famine of churches.
[1:07:58] There's so many churches, you know, we
[1:07:59] we passed 10 churches on the way to
[1:08:01] church this morning. if you drove any
[1:08:02] distance at all. It's not a a famine for
[1:08:05] denominations or programs. It's
[1:08:07] definitely not a famine for buildings or
[1:08:09] live streams. There's certainly no
[1:08:11] shortage of of YouTube shorts today. You
[1:08:13] know, there's not a famine of what
[1:08:14] anybody would just say. There's not a
[1:08:17] famine on Christian music.
[1:08:20] There's plenty of Christian music out
[1:08:21] there and there's plenty of good and
[1:08:22] there's plenty of bad, but but that's
[1:08:24] not what the famine is. There's there's
[1:08:26] not a famine, you know, in many churches
[1:08:28] for offering and there's not a famine
[1:08:30] for for certain things. But well, there
[1:08:32] is a famine for one thing and that's the
[1:08:34] hearing of the true word of the almighty
[1:08:37] God. And it said that there would be a
[1:08:39] famine. But from this pulpit by God's
[1:08:41] grace, as long as I'm here and brothers
[1:08:43] like brother Donald is here and brother
[1:08:44] Ryan and these brothers, there will be
[1:08:46] the word of God. Preach from this
[1:08:48] pulpit.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. There's not a famine, you
[1:08:52] know, even for good teaching, good moral
[1:08:55] teaching. You can find any number of
[1:08:57] good books. I began to read one the
[1:08:58] other day by CS Lewis and and it's a
[1:09:01] very good book. he wrote in the 40s
[1:09:02] after the war and and sure it's fine and
[1:09:04] it's good, you know, it's good moral
[1:09:06] teaching and and it's good Christian
[1:09:08] thought. But for me to feed my spiritual
[1:09:12] soul,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; I've got to have something with a little
[1:09:15] more depth to it, a little more Listen,
[1:09:17] Sister Dette and I, we went to we we
[1:09:19] lived in Paige for a couple years and we
[1:09:21] went to the Catholic church and the
[1:09:22] Mormon church. We went to the I think
[1:09:24] Church of Christ where they had no music
[1:09:26] literally. It was singing but there were
[1:09:28] no instruments and and you know like I
[1:09:30] said the Lutheran church and finally
[1:09:32] just so we could glean a little speck of
[1:09:34] word we ended up at the assembly of God
[1:09:38] and so and we took but even then listen
[1:09:40] I was raised eating meat like spiritual
[1:09:43] meat and so when I go somewhere else
[1:09:45] [screaming] and no offense to anybody
[1:09:47] would be from a different place this
[1:09:48] morning but let me tell you I can't get
[1:09:50] what I need unless it's the full word of
[1:09:53] God [screaming] preach the message of
[1:09:55] the hour of today. That's it. There's a
[1:09:58] famine. The plenty of preachers, not a
[1:10:01] famine for religious services down the
[1:10:03] street. I think they have three a week
[1:10:05] or three a day, excuse me. They got like
[1:10:06] a morning, you know, if you want to
[1:10:08] watch football, you go at 9:00 and
[1:10:09] you're done by 10:00, you go watch
[1:10:10] football. And, you know, if you sleep in
[1:10:12] late, you can go at 11:00 and and you
[1:10:14] can, you know, whatever happens after
[1:10:16] that. And and you know, we've got a
[1:10:17] service Saturday night. If you don't
[1:10:18] like going on Sunday, you go on Saturday
[1:10:20] night. But it's a famine for the true
[1:10:23] word of God to be preached. But it will,
[1:10:26] you know, there is a spiritual food, but
[1:10:29] it's a due season and it's a due place.
[1:10:33] Praise the Lord. Okay, there's a drought
[1:10:34] today. And then he says this, but when
[1:10:37] God sends forth a message and tells his
[1:10:39] people and and they don't receive it,
[1:10:41] then he withdraws his servant and sends
[1:10:43] his plagues, famine, death, spiritually
[1:10:45] speaking, physically also. You watch for
[1:10:48] a depression, brother. You think you've
[1:10:49] seen something. You just wait after a
[1:10:51] while. You haven't seen nothing. You
[1:10:53] think you're dying for a good spiritual
[1:10:55] revival. You wait till after a bit. You
[1:10:57] just wait long and cried to hear the
[1:11:00] word of God. The Bible said, "So
[1:11:01] there'll be a famine in the last days,
[1:11:03] said the prophet, not for bread and
[1:11:05] water alone, but for hearing the true
[1:11:07] word of God. But that voice will be
[1:11:09] quiet in the wilderness, somewhere hid
[1:11:12] away."
[1:11:14] Notice though, there was Elijah and he
[1:11:17] was somewhere hid away. But God brought
[1:11:20] him to a place and the brook is called
[1:11:23] the brook Cherith. And so he he brings
[1:11:25] him down there and the Bible says he
[1:11:27] brought him there. And if you keep
[1:11:28] reading the next chapter or two, the
[1:11:30] Bible teaches that Ahab was looking for
[1:11:33] him year after year trying to find
[1:11:36] Elijah. He probably didn't believe when
[1:11:39] Elijah first said it. So he just let him
[1:11:41] say it and then let him go. But then
[1:11:43] when the drought started to come, he
[1:11:45] began to say, "I want to find that guy."
[1:11:47] and he began to get angry in his spirit.
[1:11:49] And Obadiah says, [screaming] "Listen,"
[1:11:51] he says, "Ahab's after you and wants to
[1:11:53] kill you." Notice, he doesn't go after
[1:11:56] you cuz he wants to repent. But Ahab
[1:11:59] went after him cuz he or excuse me, went
[1:12:01] after Elijah cuz he wanted to kill
[1:12:03] Elijah. And Obadiah later says, "Listen,
[1:12:06] I'm not going to tell him you're alive.
[1:12:07] As soon as I show up there, he's going
[1:12:10] to kill me." But see, when the word of
[1:12:12] God comes to you and maybe after a
[1:12:15] minute, you recognize it to be true.
[1:12:17] Don't get angry at the messenger. It's
[1:12:19] the word of God. Accept it. Repent and
[1:12:22] move forward. That's what Ahab should
[1:12:24] have done. But he gets angry just a
[1:12:26] couple chapter chapters later. And he
[1:12:28] wants to kill him. And he seeks him.
[1:12:30] Obadiah say he's been looking for you
[1:12:32] for years.
[1:12:33] He hasn't been able to find you. Why?
[1:12:35] Because God has you and me hidden in a
[1:12:40] secret place in Christ Jesus. Even when
[1:12:43] the Antichrist comes to find us, we're
[1:12:45] going to be hidden away. Did you know
[1:12:47] that? Before the Antichrist can come and
[1:12:49] and kill you and take you away, God is
[1:12:52] going to hide you away out of this world
[1:12:54] at that time. But for now, you've got a
[1:12:56] hidden place in Christ Jesus. And in
[1:12:58] that hidden place, you've got a brook
[1:13:02] where he's taken you and you can drink
[1:13:04] from it. And then he's got this
[1:13:06] spiritual food.
[1:13:09] Brother Donald, it's right in its due
[1:13:11] season. Just try it one time if you need
[1:13:14] something. Just put a tape on and see
[1:13:16] what it might might say to you. Now,
[1:13:18] praise the Lord. Not disregarding
[1:13:20] anybody. You see, not disregarding our
[1:13:22] churches. No. Sure. But, you know, I
[1:13:24] believe in the pulpit of many of these
[1:13:26] churches, we have fine men, good men,
[1:13:28] real men of God. But they're afraid if
[1:13:30] they say anything that's contrary to
[1:13:32] what the organization says, they'll be
[1:13:34] kicked out. Then they're left in the
[1:13:36] cold. And I believe what man needs is
[1:13:38] some courage. And I believe that why I
[1:13:41] believe on God wants to take some
[1:13:43] somebody and make make an example to
[1:13:45] show that he'll take care of them
[1:13:46] regardless of their organization. And
[1:13:49] brother Bram says, I hope he'll do that
[1:13:51] with me. And I confess that same thing,
[1:13:53] Lord, regardless. And I don't believe
[1:13:55] we're an organization, but regardless as
[1:13:57] much as it hurts me. And regardless, as
[1:14:00] much as it's difficult, it's got to be
[1:14:02] said many times regardless.
[1:14:05] Praise the Lord. Oh, I love it. I just
[1:14:09] Well, I just love the word of the Lord.
[1:14:10] Okay. What? Brother Ma'am says this.
[1:14:12] What is the word? Jesus is the word. The
[1:14:15] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:14:17] to see the manifestation of the real
[1:14:18] word of God made manifest according to
[1:14:21] the scriptures and brought to pass that
[1:14:23] how people would travel. Notice he's
[1:14:25] quoting back here in First Kings. He
[1:14:27] says they'll travel and seek and would
[1:14:29] fail to find the word. So they're
[1:14:32] seeking and they're they're looking to
[1:14:34] and fro and there's a great famine for
[1:14:36] the word, the hearing of the word of the
[1:14:38] Lord. And and brother Brandham clarifies
[1:14:40] what the word is. He says this that he
[1:14:42] says, "Oh God, we are so glad that we
[1:14:46] found him."
[1:14:48] What's the message? If you're going to
[1:14:51] sum it up, that's it right there. The
[1:14:54] message is the fullness of Jesus Christ
[1:14:58] preached in this life. Not partially,
[1:15:00] not taking what we want and what we
[1:15:02] don't want. What is the message? The
[1:15:04] message is the entirety of Jesus Christ
[1:15:07] in this day. That's what the message is.
[1:15:10] Praise the Lord. All right, move
[1:15:12] forward. First Kings 7, get the hints
[1:15:14] and turn eastward. Now, he's he's
[1:15:16] talking to Elijah. He says, "Turn thee
[1:15:17] eastward and hide thyself by the brook
[1:15:20] Cherith." And and notice he has him turn
[1:15:22] and he turns a certain way and and
[1:15:24] eastward. You know, I like to say it
[1:15:26] like this that that you must if you're
[1:15:28] going to seek the word of God. You must
[1:15:30] turn towards the sun, the s o n. And
[1:15:34] then he says, "You'll drink of the
[1:15:35] brook. I've commanded the ravens." And
[1:15:37] and he did that and he went and the
[1:15:39] ravens fed him. And the brother says,
[1:15:41] "But Elijah during this time had a
[1:15:43] secret place that God had ordained for
[1:15:45] him to go." That's the thing we want to
[1:15:47] see now just before we have prayer line.
[1:15:49] Elijah had a secret place provided by
[1:15:52] God himself. Now, the church never
[1:15:54] provided it for him. The king never
[1:15:56] provided it for him. He didn't provide
[1:15:59] himself. But God provided a secret place
[1:16:02] for Elijah to be fed all the time during
[1:16:04] the drought. Notice you have a place,
[1:16:06] saints, this morning. You're in a
[1:16:08] drought this morning and you need to be
[1:16:10] fed. God has a secret provided place for
[1:16:13] you to be fed during the drought. Where
[1:16:15] was his food provided day? He didn't
[1:16:17] need to wonder what's going to happen
[1:16:18] tomorrow or wonder if the supply ran
[1:16:20] out. God said, "I've commanded the
[1:16:22] ravens. They'll feed you." What a
[1:16:24] wonderful thing. A type of our secret
[1:16:27] place in Christ. He certainly made a way
[1:16:31] for Elijah at that time. And and I think
[1:16:33] we'll move forward here. We don't got a
[1:16:35] lot of time. But but he made a way in
[1:16:37] the days of Noah. Now, that way, you
[1:16:39] could have accepted it or you could have
[1:16:41] rejected it. But he made a way and many
[1:16:43] rejected it and drowned in the waters of
[1:16:46] the flood. And he made a way in Moses's
[1:16:48] day. And you could have listened to
[1:16:49] Moses or you could have not listened to
[1:16:51] Moses. But if you listen to Moses, he
[1:16:53] made a way for you to come out of Egypt.
[1:16:55] In Noah's day, he made a way for you to
[1:16:57] get on the ark. God made a way for
[1:16:59] Elijah to go to a certain place and
[1:17:02] receive food. And he's made a way this
[1:17:04] morning. And that way is the message of
[1:17:06] the hour. I would have got more than one
[1:17:09] amen on that, but that's okay. No
[1:17:10] problem. I don't preach for the amens. I
[1:17:12] just preach for the preach. Now, we
[1:17:14] realize, Brother Bam said that we're
[1:17:15] facing one of the greatest hours that
[1:17:17] history has ever known. It isn't exactly
[1:17:19] the warhead with the bright shiny
[1:17:20] missile with a head on it that we should
[1:17:22] be afraid of. It's the churches we
[1:17:25] should be afraid of. It's the hour that
[1:17:27] we're living in that we should watch.
[1:17:28] Notice God made a way for Elijah to
[1:17:30] escape it. And he's made a way for his
[1:17:32] believing children to escape it now. The
[1:17:35] wrath and the things to come. He's
[1:17:37] definitely made a way. And we're getting
[1:17:39] to the point, saints, where it's the end
[1:17:42] of time. And I keep saying, say,
[1:17:43] "Brother Steve, you say that every
[1:17:44] week." Well, guess what? I've been
[1:17:46] hearing it. 50, 48 years in this church.
[1:17:50] That's okay. It just means it's more and
[1:17:52] closer and closer. Let me tell you, I
[1:17:54] just had this thought, Brother Donald,
[1:17:55] while you were talking. I was thinking
[1:17:56] back there, you know, Brother Donald,
[1:17:58] one day is going to hear a knock at the
[1:18:01] door. I just believe it, Brother Donald.
[1:18:02] It'll be a knock at the door. And And I
[1:18:04] don't know who'll be standing there.
[1:18:05] Could be your father-in-law. It could be
[1:18:07] you just anybody, you know, that God
[1:18:09] would put there. But but you hear a
[1:18:10] knock at the door. But I believe
[1:18:12] something like this that that he'll get
[1:18:13] his foot and put it on the floor and all
[1:18:16] of a sudden he'll be like, "Why doesn't
[1:18:17] my foot hurt this morning?" Well, that's
[1:18:20] going to be a different morning than any
[1:18:22] other morning that it's had. And he
[1:18:24] might not even notice it, but he's just
[1:18:26] going to walk to the door normal, go,
[1:18:27] "Praise God, my something something's
[1:18:29] different. I don't know what it was."
[1:18:30] And when you open the door, there'll be
[1:18:32] somebody standing there that also
[1:18:34] accepted the way that you accept it.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[1:18:41] this was striking to me that he pre he
[1:18:45] he he speaks the word of the Lord and
[1:18:48] there's a drought. And in verse 7, it
[1:18:50] says, "And it came to pass after a while
[1:18:52] that the brook dried up because there
[1:18:54] had been no rain."
[1:18:57] And that's like interesting. So, wait a
[1:18:59] minute. You spoke the word of the Lord
[1:19:01] for a drought. Then God led you over to
[1:19:03] a brook and because of the drought, the
[1:19:06] brook dried up.
[1:19:09] You ever had that happen in your life?
[1:19:10] You feel completely led of the Lord. And
[1:19:14] I mean, you know, you you did something
[1:19:15] and you God led you to a certain place
[1:19:17] and then all of a sudden it's like it
[1:19:18] dries up. You're like, "What is going
[1:19:21] on?" But I know I'm led here, but it's
[1:19:24] drying up. And and and it's just it's
[1:19:26] it's paradox. It's confusing many times
[1:19:29] to the believer that those things would
[1:19:31] happen. You'd be led somewhere to do
[1:19:34] something to talk to somebody or to go
[1:19:36] somewhere to build a house or a new job,
[1:19:38] whatever it might be. You know, you're
[1:19:40] led of God
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; and then you that that thing happens or
[1:19:43] you go and do that thing and then it
[1:19:45] just not, you know, it might be a while.
[1:19:47] The Bible says Elijah was there a while.
[1:19:49] So, he's there a while and all of a
[1:19:50] sudden it dries up and you go, "But I
[1:19:51] was led here, God,
[1:19:54] how is it drying up now? Where what am I
[1:19:56] going?" But you know, God has a great
[1:19:58] plan. And his plan, you know, it it's
[1:20:01] outside of time. It's outside of how
[1:20:03] long you might think a great while might
[1:20:05] be. It's outside of how long you you
[1:20:08] think you got to go do something or be
[1:20:10] somewhere that's outside completely of
[1:20:12] God's thought. Because if you go to a
[1:20:15] different location, there's a little
[1:20:16] woman and her husband has died
[1:20:20] and she's got a son and she's by herself
[1:20:23] and she's by herself with like a tiny
[1:20:26] bit of food left because of this great
[1:20:28] drought. Also, she's got just a little
[1:20:31] bit of food left. She's got a tiny bit
[1:20:34] of oil left. If she combines the little
[1:20:36] bit of grain and the little bit of oil
[1:20:38] and and it makes a cake and her son, you
[1:20:40] know, she's looking at him maybe like
[1:20:42] some of those children in Africa. But we
[1:20:44] saw this morning that they just got no
[1:20:46] food and and they're skinny and and so
[1:20:48] she's at like her wits end.
[1:20:52] And God loves to get us there. I hate to
[1:20:54] say it because I he loves it. Let me do
[1:20:57] what the psalmist says about your wits
[1:20:58] end. Many Anyone remember years ago we
[1:21:01] preached on a wit's end? They go down
[1:21:04] Psalms 107:23.
[1:21:06] They that go down to the sea and ships,
[1:21:09] they do business in great waters. They
[1:21:12] see these see the works of the Lord and
[1:21:15] his wonders in the deep. If you ever
[1:21:17] been on a big ship on a cruise, you look
[1:21:20] around and you can't see land anywhere.
[1:21:22] And these that that are sailors and
[1:21:25] they're on a boat, they see the works of
[1:21:27] the Lord. They see his wonders in the
[1:21:29] deep. He commandeth and raiseth the
[1:21:31] stormy wind which lifteth up the waves
[1:21:33] thereof. They mount on up to the heaven.
[1:21:37] Okay, you ever been on a boat like that
[1:21:38] and the waves are so massive that you go
[1:21:41] up and all you're seeing, you look up
[1:21:42] and all you see is the sky and then you
[1:21:44] come down and all you see is the depths
[1:21:46] of the sea. You're completely at the
[1:21:49] mercy of the waves of the sea. They
[1:21:51] mount up, they go down to the depths of
[1:21:53] their soul is melted because of trouble.
[1:21:56] Now, if you're in a hurricane, you're in
[1:21:58] a battle, you're in a torment this
[1:21:59] morning, think about this that God, you
[1:22:01] know, you see his great wonder and and
[1:22:03] you're thrown up and all you can see is
[1:22:05] all, you know, blue sky and then boom,
[1:22:07] you're coming down and all you can see
[1:22:08] is the depths of the sea and you've got
[1:22:10] no hope. You're troubled in your spirit.
[1:22:15] Their soul is melted because of trouble.
[1:22:20] They reel to and fro. They stagger like
[1:22:22] a drunken drunken man. And the Bible
[1:22:24] says this, they're at their wits end.
[1:22:27] And what that means in in Spanish, it
[1:22:29] says this. All of their all of their
[1:22:33] their their sensia, their knowledge is
[1:22:37] useless.
[1:22:40] That's what it means. The brother speaks
[1:22:42] Spanish there. It says something like
[1:22:44] this, brother.
[1:22:48] It's all it's useless. your science,
[1:22:51] your knowledge when you're in the when
[1:22:53] you're in the storm.
[1:22:55] Whatever you know is useless really. I
[1:22:59] mean, I'm talking about like
[1:23:00] intellectual knowledge. So, that
[1:23:03] knowledge in the middle of the storm of
[1:23:05] of life. Well, I'm going to read a good
[1:23:07] self-help. It might help you. Not saying
[1:23:09] it won't hurt, you know, won't help you,
[1:23:11] but even the all the psychology that you
[1:23:13] would have useless.
[1:23:15] All the pills a doctor would give you.
[1:23:17] Brother Bannon would say it like this.
[1:23:18] The doctor could give you whatever he
[1:23:20] wants, but he himself will have to
[1:23:22] confess God is the healer. So, you tried
[1:23:25] everything. All your science, all your
[1:23:27] knowledge is useless. You're at your
[1:23:29] wits end. That means God has drugged you
[1:23:33] to the very end of what you know and
[1:23:35] what you can do. And he purposely did
[1:23:38] that. He let you go all that way to
[1:23:41] prove to you you can't do it. You can
[1:23:44] row and row and roll against the storm,
[1:23:46] but boom, you're thrust up and then
[1:23:47] you're thrust down. All of your ability
[1:23:50] as a sailor, useless.
[1:23:53] I love the next verse.
[1:23:56] Then they cry unto the Lord and their
[1:23:58] trouble,
[1:24:00] and he brings them out of their
[1:24:01] distresses. Oh, that ought to make you
[1:24:03] happy. Listen, Lord, when I get to my
[1:24:06] wit's end,
[1:24:08] I cry unto you
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; and you bring me out of your distresses.
[1:24:13] So, here's the the widow woman, you
[1:24:15] know, she's she's she's I mean, she's
[1:24:18] got nothing left. She's got a little bit
[1:24:19] of cake and a little bit and she thinks,
[1:24:22] you know, I'm going to eat that. But
[1:24:23] then God, she thought that was the end
[1:24:25] of her rope. This is the end of my rope,
[1:24:28] Brother Donald. I've got meal and I've
[1:24:30] got oil. Mix them together and then I'm
[1:24:32] at the end of the rope. No, that's not
[1:24:34] the end of your rope. The end of the
[1:24:35] rope is when a prophet comes to you and
[1:24:38] says, "You can't even have that.
[1:24:42] Give that to me."
[1:24:45] That's wits end. I mean, that's
[1:24:46] officially you're at your wit's end cuz
[1:24:49] you thought you were going to have that
[1:24:50] last cake. And a prophet came, a prophet
[1:24:53] of God sent because his very brook dried
[1:24:56] up.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Sent to you. Now you're You think you're
[1:25:00] at your wit's end. You thought that was
[1:25:02] it. I gotta eat this and and that's it.
[1:25:05] But God says, "You think you're at the
[1:25:07] end of your rope? I'm gonna push it even
[1:25:09] farther
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; to prove who you are."
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; And I can only say this from experience.
[1:25:16] I have been at the absolute end of the
[1:25:19] rope. You mean the end of the rope is
[1:25:20] where you're at the end of the rope.
[1:25:22] I have been at the absolute end of the
[1:25:24] rope and watch God test me even farther.
[1:25:27] Then I'm at my wit's end,
[1:25:30] Brother Donnie. And then I cry unto the
[1:25:32] Lord. [laughter]
[1:25:33] How many has cried unto the Lord? If
[1:25:35] you're in distress this morning, go like
[1:25:37] this. Lord, I'm at my wits end. Brother
[1:25:39] Steve has just said that and I believe
[1:25:41] it and I it's it's in the it's in the
[1:25:43] scripture. I'm at my wits end. All my
[1:25:45] knowledge I've determined, Lord, it's
[1:25:46] useless. Cry unto the Lord. What What
[1:25:50] will he do? What What does the scripture
[1:25:51] say he'll do? Put that up, Sister
[1:25:53] Pauline. He says they'll cry and he'll
[1:25:55] bring them out of their distresses. He
[1:25:57] makes the storm a calm
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; so that the waves thereof are still
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; I mean just no problem if you don't amen
[1:26:09] it. Just let it sink in. No problem.
[1:26:11] Okay. So now he he he makes the storm a
[1:26:14] calm and the waves they go still and
[1:26:16] then there then are they glad because
[1:26:18] they be quiet. So he bringeth them unto
[1:26:20] their desired haven. Oh, that men would
[1:26:24] praise the Lord for his goodness and for
[1:26:26] his wonderful works to the children of
[1:26:28] men. That lady got to what she thought
[1:26:31] was a wick's end. And then she she had
[1:26:33] to do nothing but say something like
[1:26:35] this. At your word, I'll do it. Brother
[1:26:39] Bam says this, "But all the time God was
[1:26:41] working." She didn't know about it, but
[1:26:43] God told Elijah he dried up the brook,
[1:26:45] reached out his hand and stopped the
[1:26:47] brook from running. And Elijah said,
[1:26:49] "Lord, why'd it stop?"
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Think about that. How many times? I
[1:26:53] mean, this is the prophet now. Well, he
[1:26:55] had to stop it cuz he got a greater
[1:26:57] purpose. He said, "I've commanded a
[1:26:59] women w a widow woman to feed you." He
[1:27:01] already commanded her. She didn't know
[1:27:02] it. Commanded a widow woman with one
[1:27:05] cake left
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; to feed the prophet.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, every time I open
[1:27:11] up, 125 messages, I mean, that's it's it
[1:27:16] might look just like a little cake,
[1:27:17] brother Donald, but it never runs dry. I
[1:27:19] just keep feeding on it and keep feeding
[1:27:21] on it. It might look like one message
[1:27:23] and it is and I just keep feeding on it
[1:27:25] keeps opening up and opening up. If you
[1:27:27] do that this morning and you'll open up
[1:27:30] the message of the hour and you just
[1:27:31] begin to feed on the word of God, it
[1:27:34] will never run dry. Just open up your
[1:27:36] Bible this morning. You're at your wits
[1:27:37] end. Just open up your Bible, cry unto
[1:27:40] the Lord in your distress and he will
[1:27:42] deliver you out of that. Praise God. Oh
[1:27:45] my. I got Well, we do have a tiny just a
[1:27:49] tiny bit of time now. She identifies
[1:27:52] herself
[1:27:54] as a believer of this prophet. So she he
[1:27:59] comes and and she says it may we'll just
[1:28:01] we'll just read it there. And she said
[1:28:04] verse 12 of of 17 chapter 17 and and she
[1:28:08] said as the Lord thy God liveth I have
[1:28:10] not cake but a handful a meal in a
[1:28:11] barrel and and a little oil and a cruise
[1:28:14] and said behold I'm gathering two sticks
[1:28:16] the cross. Brother Brandham said, by the
[1:28:17] way, that I may go in and dress it for
[1:28:19] me and my son that we may eat it and
[1:28:22] die. I mean, you talk about wits in.
[1:28:23] This is the very thing we're going to
[1:28:24] eat and then we're going to die. And
[1:28:26] Elijah said unto her, "Fear not. Go and
[1:28:28] do as you've said. But make me a little
[1:28:30] cake first and bring it unto me, and
[1:28:33] after make for thee and thy son, for
[1:28:35] thus saith the Lord God of Israel, the
[1:28:37] barrel of meal shall not waste, neither
[1:28:39] shall the cruise of oil fail until the
[1:28:42] day that the Lord sends rain upon the
[1:28:44] earth." This message will not fail until
[1:28:47] the the day that God sends rain. It'll
[1:28:49] carry you [screaming] right on through
[1:28:50] to the end. Just keep feeding on it,
[1:28:53] saints, and identify yourself with the
[1:28:56] prophet of God. The message of don't be
[1:28:58] afraid.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; I and I want to ask you because just
[1:29:01] there's an identity crisis today. We're
[1:29:03] going to just in the next 10 minutes,
[1:29:05] we'll close with this. It's a thing that
[1:29:08] people can go and identify how they want
[1:29:10] to identify.
[1:29:13] They they well just not to get too
[1:29:16] political. It's not even political. Just
[1:29:17] just social and perversion really,
[1:29:22] but in Matias's class a few years ago at
[1:29:24] NAU,
[1:29:25] they were identifying themselves or they
[1:29:27] were introducing themselves to the class
[1:29:30] and somebody got up there and she
[1:29:32] identified herself as a dog and she
[1:29:36] began to bark to the class.
[1:29:39] And not even to make fun of her, but to
[1:29:40] think how sad it is is that someone
[1:29:42] could identify as something that they're
[1:29:45] not. And then today, you'll see that
[1:29:48] that people would say, "I'm a, you know,
[1:29:49] they were bor they were birthed a man or
[1:29:51] a boy and and they would say, well, I
[1:29:53] want to be I want to identify as a woman
[1:29:55] or they I don't even know what I am."
[1:29:57] they say many times and so would you
[1:29:59] just call me they
[1:30:01] just make it neutral and and they think
[1:30:03] that that they can identify how they
[1:30:05] want to a man would say you know I want
[1:30:07] to be a woman and and I want to identify
[1:30:09] that way but but here's the thing saints
[1:30:11] and this just occurred to me yesterday
[1:30:12] while I was studying and and maybe
[1:30:14] someone's taught on it but it's like
[1:30:16] this you can't identify with what you
[1:30:18] can push yourself into or put on or even
[1:30:22] a surgeon could make you a certain way
[1:30:23] you can't identify that way you can't
[1:30:26] have a mental thought and say, "I
[1:30:28] identify as whatever my mental thought
[1:30:30] is." But your true identity comes from
[1:30:33] your birth.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Now, take that into the natural. Now,
[1:30:37] you're born a boy or a girl, and that's
[1:30:39] your identity. That's what you are. You
[1:30:41] can't identify any other way. That's how
[1:30:43] you're born. And let me tell you this
[1:30:45] morning, you can't put on enough of
[1:30:46] enough skirts and enough long hair and
[1:30:49] enough, you know, uh, cake makeup off
[1:30:51] your face to identify as a message
[1:30:53] believer. You can't do it. Oh yeah.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; You can't I mean you can't do it. You
[1:30:58] just can't. You just I've tried by the
[1:30:59] way. You can't do it. You men you can't
[1:31:02] you can't like put away the pornography
[1:31:04] off of your phone and you can't stop
[1:31:05] cussing and stop drinking and drug and
[1:31:07] and then smoking and then say I now
[1:31:09] because I stopped all that. I now
[1:31:12] identify as a message believer. Never
[1:31:14] will work. I listen to the tapes and
[1:31:16] I've heard the prophet of God. Therefore
[1:31:18] I am a message believer. But Christ must
[1:31:20] be birthed into your heart and that is
[1:31:23] what identifies you as a Christian.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; You just start there first of all. But
[1:31:29] you must be birthed saints. That's your
[1:31:33] identif that if you're a boy, you were
[1:31:35] born into this world a boy or a girl. If
[1:31:38] you were born that way, that's how
[1:31:40] that's your natural identity. You can
[1:31:43] get a feminist spirit, you can get
[1:31:44] whatever, no problem. But you don't
[1:31:46] change your identity. And now I was born
[1:31:49] a sinner by birth.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; We are all born in sin. It's scriptural.
[1:31:55] So you were born a sinner. So now if you
[1:31:58] want to identify any other way,
[1:32:02] you got to be born
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; again.
[1:32:06] It's just a kind of a simple teaching,
[1:32:07] right? Like you want to identify as a
[1:32:09] message quote message believer. How
[1:32:11] about this? Be born again. How about be
[1:32:14] birthed and have the and have God fill
[1:32:16] [screaming] your soul. And then you know
[1:32:17] what'll happen? Say, "Well, I don't know
[1:32:19] where to go to church and I don't know
[1:32:20] how to study and I don't know how to do
[1:32:22] this." You know what the Bible says? Why
[1:32:23] don't we trust in the word? The
[1:32:25] comforter will come and he'll lead you
[1:32:29] into all light and truth. And so if you
[1:32:31] tell me, "Brother Steve, I I have been
[1:32:33] led not to follow like you know whatever
[1:32:36] you know what you believe or what the
[1:32:38] message of the hour is." Well, fine. And
[1:32:40] then I questioned who's leading you if
[1:32:42] if that's the case. Because if you if
[1:32:44] I'm birthed by the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:32:47] the comforter in my soul will lead me
[1:32:50] all
[1:32:53] the light and truth. You know, Luther
[1:32:55] came.
[1:32:57] Well, let me go this direction just for
[1:32:59] a minute. So you said, Brother Steve, do
[1:33:02] you identify as a a Christian? Yes.
[1:33:06] Well, I know some Christians who failed.
[1:33:09] Well, you're looking at one. I mean,
[1:33:11] what are you talking about? Let me ask
[1:33:13] you like this. Do you identify with
[1:33:15] Peter when he said, "Thou art the
[1:33:17] Christ, the son of the living God."
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; You identify with Peter. What about What
[1:33:23] about when he received the Holy Spirit?
[1:33:25] You identify with Peter. I identify with
[1:33:28] Peter when he walked on water. You know,
[1:33:30] one time, Brother Ray, I'm going to go
[1:33:32] to Lake Pal. I don't even need your
[1:33:33] boat. You know, I'm just going to walk
[1:33:34] over there. I'm going to be fishing off
[1:33:36] the water. But see, I identify with him
[1:33:39] in that and I identify with him when he
[1:33:41] walked on and received the Holy Ghost
[1:33:43] and when he said, "Thou art the Christ
[1:33:44] the son." I identify with all that.
[1:33:46] Well, what about when he had denied the
[1:33:48] Lord Jesus three times,
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; but let me tell I'm just criticize me
[1:33:52] later. I identify with that.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz I failed.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; And if he failed, it actually makes me
[1:34:00] feel good to identify with someone who
[1:34:02] failed and then got back up. I identify
[1:34:06] with Peter when he failed. What about
[1:34:08] what about brother Steve when he was
[1:34:09] eating with the Gentiles and the Jews
[1:34:11] came in and he got up and walked out and
[1:34:13] became a hypocrite. Do you identify with
[1:34:16] that? Well, listen, I don't want to be
[1:34:17] that way. But I do realize that I'm
[1:34:20] going to make mistakes and I might even
[1:34:21] become a hypocrite. And I pray that
[1:34:23] brother Donald will come to me and say,
[1:34:25] "Brother Steve, you become a hypocrite.
[1:34:27] You better correct your way." And then
[1:34:28] I'll identify with Peter and say,
[1:34:30] "Praise God, I was wrong. Help me,
[1:34:32] Lord." You can't just identify with
[1:34:34] Peter and all the good and fail to why?
[1:34:36] Well, listen. You need the saving grace
[1:34:39] that Peter had. The one that the Lord
[1:34:41] come to him after he was raised after
[1:34:44] Peter denied him. The Lord's come and
[1:34:46] said, "When you're converted, feed my
[1:34:48] sheep, feed my lambs." I identify with
[1:34:51] the man who fails
[1:34:54] and then gets back up.
[1:34:57] Cuz why?
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; That's me. Oh, that's me today, by the
[1:35:02] way. You know, that's me yesterday. And
[1:35:04] this morning, I woke up just ask asking
[1:35:07] not to be so condemned in my soul for
[1:35:09] all the mistakes I make. And then have
[1:35:11] to come up here knowing the kind of like
[1:35:14] flesh that I'm wearing and then speak
[1:35:16] and go, I can't, Lord. You just, you
[1:35:18] know, maybe brother Donald will just
[1:35:19] start preaching. An hour will go by and
[1:35:21] I won't even have to come out. Maybe
[1:35:23] someday brother Donald will work it out
[1:35:24] like that. I identify with the mistakes
[1:35:27] Peter made because I make them. But more
[1:35:31] importantly, identify with how he got
[1:35:33] back up. And that's what I want. If
[1:35:35] you're going to be a a believer, see,
[1:35:37] you can't just can't just identify with,
[1:35:39] you know, Brother Bam said it like this.
[1:35:40] I was I was there with George Washington
[1:35:43] and I was there with Abraham Lincoln. I
[1:35:45] was there the at the Delaware when they
[1:35:47] crossed and I was there. And listen,
[1:35:49] identifying as an American, I take the
[1:35:51] bad with the good, but I'm still an
[1:35:53] American. And he would say it like that.
[1:35:55] And I'm still a Christian saint and I
[1:35:56] believe the message of the hour and I
[1:35:58] and I identify with all of you. No,
[1:36:01] brother Steve, I I make mistakes.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; The chief of sinners right here. Paul, I
[1:36:06] got to argue with Paul. Said Paul said
[1:36:08] I'm greater than the chief. I'm not
[1:36:10] denying the word. I'm not disagreeing
[1:36:11] with the word. But I look at my own self
[1:36:13] and go, I think I got you beat. Paul,
[1:36:15] we'll have a little thing when we get to
[1:36:16] heaven. Actually, we won't because the
[1:36:18] sins will be under the blood. Praise the
[1:36:20] Lord. So your identity comes from above.
[1:36:24] Now listen, brother Ram said this and I
[1:36:26] don't know it's a few down. Sister
[1:36:27] Pauline says to me, I want to see what's
[1:36:30] promised for the day. I want to know
[1:36:33] what the light of the hour is so I can
[1:36:37] know how to walk in it. I want to know
[1:36:40] where I'm living, what age I'm in, how
[1:36:42] far up the road am I. I want to know
[1:36:45] that. Don't tell me like how how it used
[1:36:46] to be or that. I want to know right now
[1:36:48] where am I at. As Paul said, I could
[1:36:50] stand quoting again, forgetting those
[1:36:52] things that are in there in the past. I
[1:36:53] press now. I press towards the mark, the
[1:36:55] high calling to the complete
[1:36:58] identification.
[1:37:00] That's what we're at nowadays, saints.
[1:37:02] Luther, we'll close with this as you
[1:37:04] musicians come. Luther would come
[1:37:06] and he would take the Bible and he would
[1:37:08] take one verse, the just shall live by
[1:37:12] faith.
[1:37:14] You know, he took that and it would be
[1:37:16] like this. It would be like uh turn this
[1:37:20] microphone on here, brother Tim. I'm
[1:37:21] just going to I need to demonstrate
[1:37:23] something here. Okay, so it would be
[1:37:25] like taking the flashlight of this of
[1:37:29] this of this iPad. I don't even know if
[1:37:31] does this have a flashlight, brother
[1:37:32] Tim? Probably not. Okay, this Well, we
[1:37:34] used to have a flashlight up here.
[1:37:36] Taking a little phone flashlight and
[1:37:38] shining it on the Bible. And that was
[1:37:40] good. And it it it gave a lot of And you
[1:37:42] know what it did? It practically
[1:37:44] destroyed the Catholic Church. the just
[1:37:46] shall live by faith. And then Wesley
[1:37:47] came along and he had like a little bit
[1:37:50] more like a spotlight that he shined on.
[1:37:53] And then Pentecost came along and it was
[1:37:54] like two high beams shining on the word
[1:37:57] of God. But now the word of God, forgive
[1:38:00] me, I'm just going to go walk. Well,
[1:38:02] we'll take this. Now, this Bible has
[1:38:06] been placed in the sun.
[1:38:10] The entire light of the solar system is
[1:38:14] shining on the word.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Now that's the complete identification
[1:38:18] of the bride today. We don't have just
[1:38:21] that. We do have the just shall live by
[1:38:23] faith. But not only that, we do have
[1:38:25] sanctification. Praise God. We should
[1:38:27] have it. But not only that, we do have
[1:38:29] Pentecost. We ought to see the gifts
[1:38:31] moving in the church.
[1:38:34] But then we also have every light that
[1:38:36] the sun has has been shined on the word.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to be completely
[1:38:43] identified with that. Stand with me this
[1:38:45] morning. Not a not a partial
[1:38:47] identification, not a little bit of
[1:38:49] light. That's fine. You know, I I spoke
[1:38:51] with a couple brothers today that or
[1:38:53] this week, excuse me, not from around
[1:38:55] here and we begin to just jostle a
[1:38:58] little bit and they're starting not to
[1:39:00] believe what we believe. And I begin to
[1:39:02] argue with them and it hurt my soul. But
[1:39:04] but so that's why I'm preaching this
[1:39:06] this morning. Quite frankly cuz I see
[1:39:08] Satan trying to go after what we
[1:39:10] believe. It's the entire solar system of
[1:39:13] light shined on the word. Not a little
[1:39:16] bit. You can take a little bit. It's
[1:39:18] fine. It's just not for me. I'm going to
[1:39:20] take the entirety, the whole thing
[1:39:24] opened up for you and I. And we need it,
[1:39:26] by the way, because it's spiritual food
[1:39:28] in due season. Praise God. But I hope
[1:39:30] that would bless you this this morning
[1:39:31] and and then maybe encourage you to just
[1:39:35] continue on. Praise the Lord.
