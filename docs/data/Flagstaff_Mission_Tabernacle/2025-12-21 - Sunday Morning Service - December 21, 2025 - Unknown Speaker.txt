We stand with your praise. Yeah. Heat. Oh sh Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. Heat. Heat. The praise is to you, Lord. Jehovah Gyra, my provider, before we turn the service to brother Steve, I've told you many, many times over the years, I sit in the back room and I wait for the Holy Spirit to just change. I see here without being part of anything just but I hear how brother Ryan and the spirit of God is trying to find that avenue and when this song came on I knew in my heart this reset the tone Jehovah Jamis provider. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Jehovah. Oh, heat, heat. Heat up here. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. And we bless you this morning. We welcome you to the house of the Lord. And if you're a visitor, I see a couple guests this morning. We just want to welcome you. Not to call your name, uh, but Jesus knows your name. And if you have a need this morning or if you have something you need from him, he's more than able. He's your provider this morning. and he'll provide whatever need you have. I truly believe that. I've seen it. Well, we've already seen it this morning. And um that was a simple need. Sister Cynthia, would you mind giving that testimony? Actually, would that be okay? Would you would you share what you shared with me? If you have a little need, God is able to provide that. If you have a great need, he's able to provide that. You need a piece of paper, he's able to provide that. If you need healing and you're just in just in despair, he's able. Whatever you have need of this morning, we'll just tell this testimony. Let our sister share it and then let it build your faith as you as we present our needs before the Lord in prayer this morning. We'll let this kind of lay the ground for your faith to be built up. Go ahead, sister. um the it's getting towards the end of the year and usually at work um calendars start coming in for from different companies and vendors and um I have a place where I keep a calendar and no calendars have come in this year and so I went to the dollar store and picked one up and it's actually a little bit too big for my space and I looked at my calendar this morning and I said Lord could you just give me a calendar. I would really appreciate a calendar for for my wall. And I know it's small and it's like a simple simple prayer, but I walked in today and got a beautiful calendar from my wall. And I think I've been thinking about it and I thought the Lord had me ask that prayer because he already had the answer. And so, and we know that that a lot of times he answers before we even ask. And &gt;&gt; I think that was why I even asked that simple &gt;&gt; prayer because it was already answered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We know we have needs this morning. We have Sister Cindy, Brother Glenn, and Sister Karen are traveling. Brother Glenn has needs. Uh, Sister Sakoro comes to mind. Brother Don is in the hospital still. Who am I missing? We have needs. And so just brother back there raised his hand. Just just that little he would even put in a sister's mind to ask a prayer request so that why? Because he already had the answer there ready. And then he wants to manifest how great of a God he is and let us know how great and build our faith this morning because he wants to speak to our hearts. So we remember sister Belle also. Sister Rose that wrote that in and so we want to remember her. I don't I can't name them all. Lift your hand if you have a need and just he might even be having you lift your hand to have a need. So let's go to him in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we step out of the way this morning, Lord. We step aside and heavenly father, we ask you to come this morning and Lord, we want to sing and we want to praise you and we want to worship you. And all those things are part of a a service Lord to you. A part of a assembly coming together. And Lord, part of that service and part of that coming together is where we would take time to raise our hands and present needs before you, Lord. And but like our sister testified, Lord, we know the answer is already on the way. And it's probably been on the way a long time, Lord. And we just we just haven't seen the fullness of it yet. But we believe it, Lord. We do believe that it's on the way. and it's there and and we claim it for your honor and glory. And so these knees, all these hands that were lifted up, Lord, every name that was spoken, of course, you knew it even before we spoke it, Father, before we come into service this morning, before we even came in here, you knew what the needs would be. You knew how to answer. You already had the answer on the way this morning. And so, let us grab on to that faith, Lord. Would you help our faith? And would you help us to grab on, Lord, where we're failing and where we where we sometimes let Satan get in and distract us. But this morning, Lord, we dedicate ourselves wholly and completely to you. We put all our thoughts aside of the world or what we might have to do tomorrow, the coming days, Lord. And let us in this moment, Lord, we just present ourselves to you, Lord, as living sacrifices. And may you may you come down, Lord, as we've presented the needs. that now Lord, we'd ask also maybe would you speak to our hearts, Lord. Would you use Brother Eli this morning, Lord? And we know he's just a vessel. He's just a man. He's just flesh, Lord. But deep down inside, Lord, I believe before the foundation of the world, you place gifts in the body and and you knew they would be there, Lord. And then you knew where and and how and you would arrange it all and you'd place it and and so this morning, Lord, would you use the gift that's in our brethren? And Father, would you speak to us in a mighty way? Would you would you just pour out your blessings upon us, Father? Wherever there would be a need, the a question in a person's mind, Lord, would you answer that question through the speaking and the ministering of the word, Lord? And and would we go out of here, Father. We'll we'll give you all the glory and the honor and the praise. And we'll say, "Man, didn't our hearts burn within us when he talked with us on that Sunday morning, Lord?" And we'll know it wasn't a man speaking, Lord, but we'll know it was you speaking to our hearts. And so we we claim that for your honor, Lord, for your glory, for for lifting you up this morning, Father, meet every need, Lord, be with our our little program. And may every portion of what the children might do this morning, Lord. Would it all be turned to you? We know we know what the time is, Lord. We know when sheeps are when sheep are born, when lambs are born, Lord, but we're putting aside today to honor the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ. And may everything honor and glorify you this morning. Lord, be with us. We want to tell you we love you. We appreciate you so much. Be with us in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. I believe the Sunday school is ready. So, let's just Brother an will sing that chorus one more time and then I'll step aside and we'll have the children come forward. Oh, heat, heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. A Oh, heat, heat. love for me. Let me see. That's two. Luke 2 1-7. And it came to pass in those days that there were when out And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. And this taxing was first made when Sirenus was governor of Syria. And all went to be taxed. everyone into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was one of the house and lineage of David, to be taxed with Mary, his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was that while they were there, the days were accomplished that they should be delivered. And she brought him forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the end. And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you, you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger." And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, good will toward men." &gt;&gt; Amen. And it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds and herds said one to another, "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us." And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and a babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they had made known abroad, saying which was told to them concerning this child. And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen. And it was told unto them. And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. Silent night, holy night, all is long, all is bright. Brown virgin mother and child. Holy inant so tender in mind. Sleep in heavenly peace. Lead in heavenly peace. Silent night, holy night, darkness, all is light. Shepher the angels singlelu hail the king. Christ the savior is born. Christ the Savior is born.

Silent night, holy night, wonderous star. Let the light with the angels let us sing. Hallelu to our king. Christ the savior is born. Christ the Savior is born. When I hang my thread at the end of my rope. When I'm losing my grip and I've lost all hope. Along comes a strength beyond my control. Oh, that's what Jesus is. With the scoundrels and drunkards, lepers and me on a hill far away between a couple of thieves. the last place on earth you think he would be. But that's right where Jesus is. The prince of peace and perfect love. That's who he is and where I run. I can't count the ways that I'm not enough. But thank God. Oh, thank God. Jesus is when I'm walking back guilty from the places I go with no hesitation. He welcomes me home. He's not afraid to get mud on his robe. That's just how Jesus is. The prince of peace and perfect love. That's who he is and where I run. I can't count the ways that I'm not enough. But thank God. Oh, thank God. Jesus is the prince of peace and perfect love.

Emmanuel. God with us living inside. Emmanuel. over the hill. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Oh, heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. Amen. Amen. We have a brother Steve, what would you like us to do? Would you would you What would the best thing for us to do? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right. Would that be okay if we played this a little bit? This is two minutes and I think it follows with uh with what was said, what was done, what was I listened to the songs and one of the songs is true light. This is brother Brandon. Talked to brother Steve beforehand. Brother, I'm going to just do it off of this mic if that's okay. It's only 2 minutes, 3 minutes long, but listen to any place that I've ever seen in my life. Uh especially with this many people where there was so many nice Christians with this love. Don't never let that die among you. Just remember uh used to have little the saying amongst the people um my wife's name was hope my first wife Billy's mother used there's three of us then was hope and myself and Billy used to call us hope faith and charity and so I seem to have a burly faith like in those days to believe that this word was true and what God had promised he would do and but you see the greatest of this is charity is Love, like brother Leo expressed this morning, uh, love, where there is tongues that shall cease, where there's prophecies that'll fail. But when charity, which is love, it always will endure. Dear dying lamb, thy precious word shall never lose its power to all the ransom church of God be saved to sin no more. Ever since by faith, I saw the stream thy flowing wound supplied. Redeeming love has been my theme. It shall be till I die. I think there's nothing greater than love and love if we can't express it. Now, we can say that we have love. We're just saying that. But when we can really express what we said that we have, then we show it in ourselves. How we're not a perfect people. We make our mistakes. We do things that's wrong. But you see, love covers all of that. We're willing when we see our mistakes to come back and apologize to one another. That's that's warriors. That's that's really man of and women it's gallant. &gt;&gt; Any man can go out to the battlefield. It's got nerve enough to walk out there, but when he gets knocked down, they get up and try it again. See, &gt;&gt; used to be a song that a young man and young woman used to sing in the church. Um, if I fall or if I fail. See, if I fall or if I I forget how it goes. Let me rise and try again. Forgive me, Lord, and try me one more time. See, if I fall or if I sin, let me rise and try again. Just forgive me, Lord, and try me one more time. &gt;&gt; And with as many as 120 people here together, you're bound to just find things sometimes the enemy will sweep in among you and through your minds and and start this that. Just stop when he does it. Think back. Think of this morning. Think of the times when you're sitting together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we think of the wonderful times we're sitting together in heavenly places. Amen. Amen. You love the Lord. Amen. Amen. Um you know I brother Ryan may not seem like the best Christmas quote unquote quote victory ahead. &gt;&gt; But that is the best Christmas news I can tell you. there's victory ahead. You know, I was standing with the brother. It's uh you know, when he was minister, we were talking. We were just enjoying the company of each other. Um and he said, you know, I just feel like I'm so dry in my soul. I just need a little touch. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I raised my hand with that. Today is a good day. Tomorrow I don't know about. But there's victory ahead. So sing it with me with joy in your heart. Amen. Victory ahead. Oh, victory ahead. Victory ahead. The blood of Jesus. Yeah. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. Oh, heat, heat. Heat up here. A Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey, Heat. Heat. Heat. replay of that. Listen, couple months ago, the church was getting a little quiet. It was a Wednesday night and it was kind of like, you know how Wednesday night can be sometimes. And I got inspired and I said, "Let's just go walk around the Do you remember that, Brother Everett?" I remember cuz he was the first one, you know. And I said, 'Lord, if Brother Donald turns it over to me right now, I'm going to have the church walk around again. And why don't you just go tell somebody this this kind of a marching beat, you know? It's got like a a marching beat. Why don't you get out of your seat? You go walk around a little bit and let the Lord know that you're you're here to conquer tread. Tell you what, why don't you do a little treading on the devil this morning and I'm Brother Donald, you stay up here, guard the pulpit if that'd be all right. Or you can walk if you want. I'll guard it. All right. I'm going to walk around and I'm going to tread on the devil a little bit. We're going to tread him down. Then we're going to invite the the brother to come out in a minute and we're going to victory ahead. Oh, victory ahead. Yes. The victory. Oh, heat, heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh my god. Heat. Amen. Amen. You didn't think I was crazy. You think I was crazy now? That's all right. I think the prophet of God said something like this. This will be the quietest place you'll ever worship the Lord. So, I just kind of believed that. Thank the Lord. Brother Jeremiah, thank you for filling up the little blank spot up here. I was wanting to go sit there myself, but you all filled it up. Now, you loosened up a little bit. When the brother comes out, it's not the brother. &gt;&gt; When that word goes forth, Amen. that word, pull on it, ask for something from the Lord. And we do believe that you'll receive what you ask for. Uh for everybody, we have enough food at the end of the service. We had catering being brought in. So, you're welcome. Please stay and fellowship with us after the service. There's some desserts down there. And if you got a sweet tooth and we'd love to have all of you stay. It's been a blessing. And um already been a blessing this morning. My heart was refreshed just watching the children and hearing the songs and just truly was blessed in the Lord. So, amen. Ask the Lord to bless us now as the brother would come and we'll sing Amazing Grace, Brother Ryan, and Brother Eli's been here several times. Always appreciated his ministry, fellowships with brother Aaron McGary and a wonderful fellowship down there. So we just ask the Lord would speak to us this morning. Yeah. Heat. Heat up here. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. A Amen. To a Christian, that song never gets old. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. I love how it says whenever I I realized the grace of God when the first time I believed that's when the relief came you know the grace is always here when that's why Jesus came that's why he he was in a major that's why he became a man that's why he died and that grace has been spread abroad this whole earth &gt;&gt; for years and years and years &gt;&gt; but it's whenever you believe &gt;&gt; that grace is here. &gt;&gt; It's ready. &gt;&gt; When you believe, you are relieved. &gt;&gt; When you believe, you are set free. &gt;&gt; When you believe, that major becomes real. &gt;&gt; When you believe, the Holy Ghost is here for you. &gt;&gt; So, Amazing Grace is going to be your song the your whole life. &gt;&gt; Um, I'm just so thankful for our brother Steve. Um, it's always a blessing to be here. um always a great atmosphere with each and every one of you and just the worship and seeing the little kids um worshiping the Lord, you know, it's it's just such a beautiful thing to see an innocent heart and um that's why I love that Jesus says, "Forbid the children um to come to me." He says, "Come, they are the kingdom of heaven." &gt;&gt; So, let us go straight to the scriptures if you like. I don't want to take too much of your time, but um so I'll try to um not be too lengthy. Like brother uh Steve said, we we're coming from brother Aaron Mciris. Um I just want to greet you all for him and um greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ. If you'd like to turn with me to 2 Corinthians 4 6 and 7. Now, my title is a little Christmy, but I I hope my delivery is also it's not um you know, I can't bring you the the tinsel and the wrapping paper and and all these things, but we're going to go into God's word and see what what the the word says to us today. &gt;&gt; So, my title today is earthly wrapping and heavenly gift. And I I get that inspiration from brother Brandham's message, God's wrapped gift. I I encourage each and every one of you to to really listen to it and um see the depth &gt;&gt; of that message in its simplicity because he preaches it so simple, but it's so deep. And that's kind of my inspiration for this message here. So the Bible says here in 2 Corinthians 4:6 and 7 says, "For God who commanded light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthn vessels." the that the excellently excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. &gt;&gt; Let us bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we have read your scripture, Lord. Well, we already feel your presence. We know you're here working in the people, Father. You know every need. You know everything we need, Father. And we're just putting it in your hands. We ask that you just continue to have the preeminence, Lord, and speak to us. Give to us exactly what we need, Father. We give you the honor, the glory in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. You may be seated. So I I really appreciate Paul very um knowledgeable man full of re revelation. He says that we have this treasure. Now he explained what the treasure was. He said this light hath come is this is the knowledge of the glory of God that is seen in the face of Jesus Christ. It is the word. It is Jesus Christ. And he says, "It has been shown into each and every person's heart that is willing." Right? So now he's like, "Well, think about it." That's the way I feel like Paul is kind of talking to us. He's like, "Think about it. &gt;&gt; We have this treasure &gt;&gt; hidden in earthn vessels. &gt;&gt; And the earthn vessel is you and I. &gt;&gt; We are that earthly wrapping paper, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we have a gift. We have a treasure that is there. And I like what he says. He says that the excellency of the power may be of God &gt;&gt; and not of us. &gt;&gt; So sometimes, you know, my wife and I've seen other people, they they wrap presents really really nice. &gt;&gt; And and you know what? Sometimes we just don't appreciate the wrapping sometimes cuz we come and I'm I'm just like an animal and I just don't appreciate all the time and effort that she did just to wrap the present because I'm actually interested in the gift. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'm actually interested in what's inside. &gt;&gt; And Paul, he's saying that the glory &gt;&gt; may not be of us. &gt;&gt; What are we just the wrapping? &gt;&gt; We're just the wrapping. But we're hiding something. &gt;&gt; You're you're hiding something in this earthly vessel. &gt;&gt; That's true, &gt;&gt; brother. He says, now that's I just wanted to say that. We're going to go a whole lot deeper and I hope it's just not too too much, but um Brother Brandham says um in God's wrapped gift preached in 1960. He says, "It ought to be real attractive to the people. Little Jehovah crying like a baby. God made flesh in a package. God who covers now he explains God right there. There's, you know, we we try to fit things in in certain boxes like we have extra Amazon packages. We're like, we're going to fit that gift in that package, right? This is what God tried to do and he did it successfully. He said, "God who covers all space and time was before the world or or a star or a molecule wrapped himself in a little package and was laid in a manger &gt;&gt; in a stable where the manurss of the cattle and the sheep and things up all um over at that stable. And in this little manger or straw or hay, Jehovah was laying there crying like a baby. Then he says, "Can you imagine it?" &gt;&gt; He gives us the authority to like just think about it and just say, "You know what? Just let it run in your mind &gt;&gt; that this eternal being that we serve, &gt;&gt; this God that knows every thought, &gt;&gt; just like the sister's testimony that he he's working things." &gt;&gt; See, you go you go out &gt;&gt; to Flagstaff, you go into Phoenix and you just see the hustle and bustle. &gt;&gt; You see cars crashing. You see people walking by here, going there, going to Target, coming out of here, doing this, having errands to do, going to work, and you have see all this hustle and bustle, &gt;&gt; and you have to step out and think. I I started to think about it during your testimony, sister, just to think that it's like God doesn't only know the movement and the thoughts of the people, &gt;&gt; but he's orchestrated every step. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So even though you see chaos and all these things, you don't know that that car crash, you'll be like, "Oh man, that guy was crazy." And you just keep going. That car crash was for a reason. So that person may maybe he's going to the hospital. The other person's maybe going to jail or something else. And then things are happening in their life that is ultimately going to be for God's purpose in every single thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you see a bird going that way, there is a specific reason. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Thank God for that." &gt;&gt; God knows all things. And and um he did the same thing. Now, so I started to think about it, how God wrapped in this little gift. &gt;&gt; And um I wanted to go all the way to the beginning and and begin to start thinking about this profound statement of God's wrapped gift &gt;&gt; that that God could have. He said this was the greatest Christmas gift that God the first and the greatest &gt;&gt; he could give to people. It was what? It was his eternal being wrapped in flesh. &gt;&gt; Okay. Why is that so important? &gt;&gt; Why why is that so important? So I started to think about um Stephen when he was there uh in the Sanhedrin council, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And these people they they would hear his wisdom. They said, the Bible says that he had so much wisdom of God and he would just wrap those people up and they they just couldn't do anything. So what they needed to do is they needed to bring up two false witnesses. &gt;&gt; They said, "You know what? We need to accuse this man and put him to death because he's causing trouble." What there was the two um accusations that they did to this man. They said, "You know what? He's speaking against our the law of Moses, &gt;&gt; right? and he he's speaking against the holy temple of God. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Those are the two things they accused him of. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now you have you have Stephen and he he comes to his defense &gt;&gt; and and he begins to answer to these charges that they they've laid out before him and you he's there in the council and everybody's just ready ready to just tear him to pieces &gt;&gt; and he gives this a long speech reviewing Israel's history from Abraham to Joseph to Moses then to David all the way to Solomon &gt;&gt; and his main point here here in Acts Acts 7:48 and 49. &gt;&gt; His main point is that God has never been limited to any building, &gt;&gt; any place. He's never been limited to any of those things &gt;&gt; because they were saying, "Well, this is our holy temple and you're speaking against it." And he said, "You think he's limited to this place?" &gt;&gt; That was his his statement. And and when he reaches Acts 40 uh 7:48 and 49, he explains how that although Solomon built the temple, God does not live in man-made structures. &gt;&gt; And and and to support this, he quoted Isaiah 66:1 &gt;&gt; where where it says, "How be it here in Acts 48 and 49, how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as saith the prophet, heaven is my throne, and earth is my foottool. What house will you ye build me? Sayaeth the Lord. Or what is the place of my rest? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, he's asking a question. &gt;&gt; He said, "Where is it?" He He's He went all the way down the history of Israel and showed him that he wasn't limited in a place. Yet, they wanted to create an epicenter. He wanted to create a a a place. They wanted to create a place to where you say, "Oh, well, we are the children of God. This is the place of God." And he says that God's not limited. You're putting him in a box there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was the purpose of his statement? That heavens and earth &gt;&gt; all of creation that he created could not contain him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Cannot contain him. &gt;&gt; And so God's asking him, "Where is my place?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Where do I abide? &gt;&gt; So the purpose of the statement for him was was to show Israel that he they repeatedly misunderstood God's presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Correct. and and and to correct the idea that the temple was itself a guarantee of God's favor. We see that over there in um during uh Samuel's time during or yeah during Samuel's time where where Eli the high priest and his sons they've sinned and and and the the ark was taken away and they trusted in the ark so much so and they forgot the obedience of God and they said you know what if we have the ark we're going to be successful but they didn't know that God wasn't interested in that he was interested in the obedience of the children of s. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; so they they were they were um thinking that was God's guaranteed favor and it wasn't. Now, the last reason for the statement was was a setup for his rebuke overall that accuses the accounts for being stubborn and resisting the Holy Ghost which ultimately led him to his martyrdom. Right? &gt;&gt; So, so his his whole point he went and he said, "And that's why you resist the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; That's why you can't accept Jesus Christ because the Holy Spirit is not over there in that temple that was rented when Jesus Christ died. &gt;&gt; So, he goes and he says all that and the reason why I'm saying this is because he quotes Isaiah 66:1 and he says, "Where is my place? &gt;&gt; Where do I sleep? Where do I stay? &gt;&gt; Um, Hebrews 10:5, if you'd like to turn with me, it says, "Wherefore he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body thou prepared me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou a body hast thou prepared me? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now the reason why I'm saying this is because brother Brandham you know being um a prophet &gt;&gt; what he does to these two scriptures here in Acts for uh 7:48 and 49 and and Hebrews 10:5 he goes and he brings those two scriptures together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He does a little bit of copy and paste here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and and because Hebrews 10:5 is an answer to Acts 7:48 and 49. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, he says this in the message, "What house will you build me?" Preached in 1965. He says he he combines the two scriptures and he says, "But how be it the most high dwellst not in temples made with hands. See, for heaven is my throne and earth is my foottool and where is the place of my rest?" Then brother Ben Brandham says, "But a body thou hast prepared me." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so he's not limited in all these things, but God prepared himself a body. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; He prepared himself, if I would like to say, people. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just one body. &gt;&gt; God came down to to change everything in a body, but he prepared human beings &gt;&gt; to be his temple. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 1:26, we see that clearly, right? where it says, "God said, let us make man in our own image &gt;&gt; after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl, over the air, over the the cattle, over the all of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." Now, in this scripture, God creates man out of his eternal spirit. He was a piece of God. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; everything else he says, "Let us create fish out of the water. Let's create the animal out of the field. Let's create this out of here. Let us make man out of my image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he created a man. It was an eternal spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a spirit of God. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And and when he created this spirit, he gave this spirit dominion. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let them have dominion over the earth." So, it's if you would like, if I if I could say this, it's the spirit that rules. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; The spirit is the one that rules the earth. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's who he gave the dominion over. &gt;&gt; And and he gave this them this decree as spirits being part of God. But the world was a place of dirt. &gt;&gt; Correct? &gt;&gt; So he gives this spirit, but this place is &gt;&gt; tangible. Right? &gt;&gt; You got to touch the ground. &gt;&gt; You got to have hands and feet. &gt;&gt; You got to shake the brother's hand. &gt;&gt; You got to give your testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to live the life. &gt;&gt; So, so he gave this to spirits, but the earth is dirt. &gt;&gt; So, we see this dilemma and we see that dilemma in in Acts 7:48 and 49. &gt;&gt; He says, you know what? Um, I'm this great God, but I need a place. &gt;&gt; Amen. I need something to work in. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says in the message um question and answers on Genesis preached in 1953. This is a lengthy lengthy quote, but I I'll try to get as quick as possible. He says, "Now, if a man was made made um made something like that, like that little sacred light yonder or something like that that it could not be seen, which is a spiritual being." &gt;&gt; Right? See, now we are made in the same material of God's unseen spirit. He just said that we are made of that that spiritual being. &gt;&gt; He manifested or unfolded himself a little more to make the trinity of himself, father, son, holy spirit. There he was. God unfolded himself now down into let us make man, which was his son a as an offspring from him, man in his own image. He was a supernatural being. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he let them have dominion over the cows, over the field and so forth and let man let um led the cattle and everything just like the Holy Spirit leads a real believer today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um the voice of God out there, the voice of man rather should speak and say, "Call the cattle this way. Call the sheep over in this pasture. Call the fishes to the water." See, he had dominion dominion. Everything obeyed him. But now or or now but then there was no man to till the soil. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So what was it? Earth needed a physical connection. &gt;&gt; Genesis 2, no man to till the soil. Then God formed man out of the dust of the earth. So now everything, it's amazing. God, when he created everything, he stood back and he said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let the fish come out of here. Let all these things. and he stood back and he allowed the earth to to form what he was calling out &gt;&gt; of the earth, out of the dust. But when he said, "Let us create man out of our own image," he went down and he touched man. &gt;&gt; He formed himself. &gt;&gt; He put his own hands on it. So who we are, no matter how we look, no matter what color we are, no matter what ethnicity, whatever race, whatever we are, we are specially made from God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We we he he he went down and he he's like, you know what? I got this. &gt;&gt; I want to specifically make this. Why do you want to make that? &gt;&gt; Why didn't he do that to the horse? Why didn't he do that? Because this was a temple he was building. &gt;&gt; Amen. This this was something that was going to wrap his holy spirit in. &gt;&gt; He needed this perfect. &gt;&gt; So he followed he formed man out of the dust of the earth and put his supernatural spirit. &gt;&gt; Now he was laying there and I can have many pictures of it. He says I can see Adam standing let's say take this way him standing there like a tree and and God made him and he was dead as dead could be his toes like the roots sticking to in the ground. And God said, "Let there breathe be or breathe the breath of life in him." And he jumped and came to himself and he breathed the breath of life to him. He became a living soul. Now he became to move on and move on. He says, now he continues on just so that I can kind of solidify this point in blasphemous names and preach in 1962. He says, "But God, what did God um but what what God did breathe the breath of eternal life." Amen. Then he becomes a living soul. A soul can't die. Now watch. We're going to get in into the honey plum into your elbows. Notice breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils. And he became an eternal soul. cause cuz God breathed not what nature done &gt;&gt; but what God did &gt;&gt; breathe the breath of life into his nostrils and then he became a living soul. So so there there had to been this body and then the only way to become this living soul was the breath of &gt;&gt; not just the air &gt;&gt; eternal life &gt;&gt; then he became a living soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. here. Here he says this, and this is rather crude, but the prophet says it, so just don't don't um throw rocks at me, please. But it says um 1953 um question and answers on Genesis. This is a good picture because why are we talking about all this? Well, well, let's see it in another way. &gt;&gt; If if a man doesn't have a spirit, &gt;&gt; why are we made? He says, "Now you take the Holy Spirit off a man &gt;&gt; says he's lower than an animal. &gt;&gt; He's worse than an animal. &gt;&gt; That's a hard thing to say. &gt;&gt; But you can take a man that's ungenerated in his mind without the Holy Spirit to direct his thoughts and and things thing like that and he would throw a baby out of his mother's arms and ravish her for beastly lust." That's exas Exactly. &gt;&gt; What is it? a man out of his position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A man not being used for what he was created for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So any person, any man, any woman that is living this life without the Holy Spirit is out of dislocated, out of of position with God. &gt;&gt; As he says, we are become lower than animals. &gt;&gt; Right? Because just just to uh back up brother Brandham on this because we have the choice. &gt;&gt; We have such a an authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we can do whatever we want to do. &gt;&gt; Animals don't have that. &gt;&gt; They just go by nature, by instinct, by all these things, by they know what to do already. &gt;&gt; We we have a free moral agency. Correct. &gt;&gt; And without the spirit of God, &gt;&gt; we begin to use that free moral agency in horrible ways. And we can see it today. &gt;&gt; We are living in that today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so Genesis 2, he creates a body for that spirit to operate and to rule. So, now we're understanding why he needed a place. He needed he needed something. This means man, he cannot dominate the earth without God's spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's a decree of dominion that he gave to the spirit and not the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's why we can conquer, we can be the greatest, but &gt;&gt; all we're doing is just ruining this place &gt;&gt; because he gave the decree, the dominion to the spirit &gt;&gt; of man, which is part of God. &gt;&gt; So, and also also God will not fully operate or reveal himself without man. &gt;&gt; So, it takes two, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. So God God he when he his greatest revelation when he is when he comes into man &gt;&gt; his greatest revelation was when he was all man and all God in the same body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord &gt;&gt; because that's how God made it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So man, we are the spirit's vehicle to operate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bammy says in the message a a greater than Solomon is here. He says, "Now he has no hands but yours and mine." &gt;&gt; He has no voice but mine and yours. &gt;&gt; See, the vine doesn't bear fruit. The branch bears fruit. &gt;&gt; And if the branch &gt;&gt; um bore the first limb that came out of the the grape vine, as I said, they wrote a book of Acts behind it. If they ever put forth a another original vine, you will write another book of Acts behind it. It'll be the same spirit cuz the same life in the entire vine every branch bears will be there. &gt;&gt; So we are the hands, we are the feet. &gt;&gt; You are important. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What whatever you God has a purpose for you and he wants to operate through you. &gt;&gt; So Christianity is just not coming to church. Christianity is not just just doing traditional ritual things, but it's a life lived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God living your life through you, operating through you. &gt;&gt; Now, now you have to think that we the spirit that's if you look at how we're made as a as a seed and all those things that we are we have a compartment for that holy spirit. We are are completely created for that Holy Ghost to come in. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 3:16, it says, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God &gt;&gt; and that the that the spirit of God dwelleth in you?" &gt;&gt; So he's ask he's letting them know. &gt;&gt; He says, "Do do you know why you are the temple?" 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 it says, "What? Know ye not uh um know ye not know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in in you which ye have of God and ye are not of your own. So there he he's explaining that our body is not our own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we we can uh do so much in this flesh and we can do all this but but remember that we should not live with these five senses. &gt;&gt; Amen. We should not operate um pleasing this five senses &gt;&gt; but we should make sure that the spirit in us leads everywhere we go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now now um ne next scripture is 2 Corinthians 4 6 and 7. It says for and this is the my our opening scripture. It says, "For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthn vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's what we are made of. Now, now we have this great fight going, right? Brother Brandon said it was the greatest battle ever fought. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the fight is not for earthly dominion. &gt;&gt; It's not for your finances. &gt;&gt; It's not for the house that you're paying off. &gt;&gt; It's not It's not for your health even. &gt;&gt; What is this fight for? It's for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's for you. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; It's It's to have dominion of you &gt;&gt; because we are not of ourselves. We are temples. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are meant to be dwelt in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are meant to to operate as the spirit operates. &gt;&gt; So, so why my question is why is the devil so eager to attack the children of God? &gt;&gt; Why is he so eager to to possess the people of this world? &gt;&gt; Why why does he want this kingdom? &gt;&gt; What what what's who is this person? Well, in Genesis 1:1, the Bible says God created heavens and earth. And in between that, brother Brandham says was trillions and trillions and hundreds and trillions of years. &gt;&gt; And in that space, in that period, God created heavenly kingdoms, heavenly beings. He created all those things within that time. Brother Brandham says within that py uh period this dramatic scene of a person named Lucifer was created &gt;&gt; his co-artnership was there &gt;&gt; and his rebellion took place there &gt;&gt; something happened right there &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now now Isaiah uh in Isaiah 14:12 &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; God calls this Satan Lucifer &gt;&gt; Lucifer what does it mean a lightbearer or the shining one. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think about that in your mind. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about a body. &gt;&gt; I I want you to think about someone who who had the light of God in him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He was a shining angel. And Ezekiel, it says whenever Ezekiel began to see that vision coming from the north, he saw a great big storm coming from the north. He saw it twirling and then he saw a a a fire. It says it was engulfing itself. Then when it became to get closer and closer, he saw beings stepping out of it. &gt;&gt; Remember remember that? Amazing. &gt;&gt; Amazing. It terrify anybody. He said that it was it was these living creatures, these cherubim &gt;&gt; walking out of the and and they were like amber. Brother Brandham says every time you hear and you hear amber in the Bible, you know exactly what that is. &gt;&gt; It was God's own light. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was he was this this angel was engulfed in God's light. It was his clothing. It was his makeup. &gt;&gt; Think about it &gt;&gt; here in in uh in Ezekiel Ezekiel 28:14 and 6. It says that he was called the covering cherub. It also says that that all the rainbow colors was his covering. The onyx, the all all those beautiful colors. It says that that was his covering, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And it says that he was lifted up. Why? Because of his brightness and his beauty, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So th that's what this angel is. He was brother Baram says everything he he wanted to make everything beautiful. Why? He was a beautiful angel. &gt;&gt; You think he was he was beautiful in his heart? &gt;&gt; He was a beautiful angel. his whatever however God created him, he was the most beautiful angel there. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's how God created him. &gt;&gt; Now here um here in 1 Corinthians 15:38 here Paul begins to explain different kinds of bodies. He says, "But God giveth a body which um which it hath pleased him, and to every seed is his own body. &gt;&gt; All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one one kind of flesh of men, the other of beasts, the other of fishes, the other of birds. There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies, but the glory of the ter celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is the other." &gt;&gt; Correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. So remember what is a body? It's a temple. &gt;&gt; It's a wrapping paper. &gt;&gt; It's a dwelling place. &gt;&gt; And and this this angel, &gt;&gt; he he was a temple also. &gt;&gt; Now in Luke 17 there there's this um strange picture here. Now, in in the New Testament, the Old Testament doesn't really talk about devils and demons and and and spirits and all that, but but the New Testament really with a razor knife, it just begins to &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; expose and show all those things. In Luke 7 uh 10:17 and 18 it says that the 70 returned again with joy saying even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. &gt;&gt; Now think about it. Why were they rejoicing? &gt;&gt; Because through the name of Jesus Christ they were able to cast out a spirit from a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are these spirits? &gt;&gt; Right? You you go to the theologians, you go to other people, they say, "Oh, well, those spirits are are different from the angels." And but brother Benham says those were the angels. &gt;&gt; These spirits, &gt;&gt; why they what what were they doing? They were trying to press themselves in human flesh. &gt;&gt; And God Jesus Christ gave them the authority through his name to cast out those devils. And and there they were rejoicing. And in 18, Jesus says unto them, "And I beheld." Now, he goes back and I don't know if he got a vision or what, but he says, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven." &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; what was it? He had a picture of what happened over there in heaven. &gt;&gt; Right, &gt;&gt; man? That poor devil's always getting cast out. &gt;&gt; He's getting So, when they they were over there, we cast them out, Lord. We cast them out. He's like, "Ah, just like the beginning." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cast him out over there. He saw I saw him as lightning fall from heaven onto this earth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amazing. &gt;&gt; Praise. &gt;&gt; So, so this act of casting out a spirit out of a body, he sees Satan fall out of his habitation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to Jude um 16 here. this scripture. A a lot of people, a lot of theologians, a lot of great well-known people will tie this scripture with Noah's time showing they'll say, "Oh, that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men, they said that angels press themselves in human bodies." &gt;&gt; And they'll use this scripture. &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? Just to give them their credit, I know they're reading from the book of Enoch and other things, but to give them their credit, they're correct, but they're dislocated. &gt;&gt; Because that angel pressed into a human body, but it wasn't there. It was in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't a human body. It was a serpent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He pressed himself and he went and he went with the children of men. went with the women &gt;&gt; which her name was Eve, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But they they thought it was there. So, um just to give you that that's not in my notes, but &gt;&gt; there um it says that the angels which now I want you to just capture every single word here because Jude, he's a tremendous man. He says, "And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left," so they kept not their first estate, " &gt;&gt; Left their own habitation, &gt;&gt; he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day." &gt;&gt; So what happened? They they could not keep their first position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lucifer was the greatest. All of the angels that were behind him, they they were great. And God kicked them out of their position. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And and and the Bible says, "And now he hath reserved." People say, "Oh, yeah, they're somewhere in chains and all of that." But but it it means he has kept them &gt;&gt; means that God has fixed their fate &gt;&gt; into his plan. And even though Satan and his de uh demons, they're still active now. &gt;&gt; There's a sign and there's a judgment coming. You have been reserved for judgment. That's true. &gt;&gt; Just like whenever God gives us the Holy Spirit, we are reserved or we have the earnest of what? Our resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So whenever God, he reserved, he kicked them out. He reserved eternal judgment to them. &gt;&gt; They're still roaming around, but they're in darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're in in they're in a a in a restricted power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're kicked out of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're kicked out of all everything good and they're condemned prisoners waiting for their sentence to be carried out. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham, he he says this in in uh in 1963, there is only one way provided by God for anything. He says, if you notice, Lucifer is exactly doing the same thing today that he did in the beginning. See Lucifer in the beginning wanted to build himself a kingdom which was greater more beautiful than than Michael's kingdom Christ he um and he that was um his ambitions to achieve something like that what did he get by do um why what did he um what did he get to do it by he took fallen angels. So, how did he achieve his how did he accomplish this? By fallen angels who' lost. Now, brother Brandon's quoting Jude 6. Now, &gt;&gt; this is just to back up that scripture. He says, who lost their first estate, he took that to do with it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, those angels who lost their first estate, that's who he took down. Those the the the third or the twothirds, the brother Brandham says he took them down with him. church &gt;&gt; now the Bible it says in in Jude 6 it says that they left their habitation &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now that word that changes everything that that's a Greek word called okotarian now okitarian it means a dwelling place a habitation for the body &gt;&gt; as a dwelling place for the spirit now it's only recorded two times in the New Testament ever it's recorded here and it's recorded another place we're going to talk about, but but it's it's a dwelling place for a body. &gt;&gt; So, they were kicked out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Here, brother Ben Brandham says in um question and answers on um Genesis preached in 1953. He says, "Now twothirds of the earth is in sin. more than that which is two uh thirds of the angels was kicked out and those demon spirits come into people uh he says um which twothirds of those angels was kicked out and those demon spirits so now he's saying those angels are those demon spirits come into people and now brother Bram's using the same uh language as Jude he says and habitate their body &gt;&gt; correct &gt;&gt; so They left their habitation &gt;&gt; and now they come down and they're habitating &gt;&gt; in what? A human body. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; See what I mean? They're demons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That once they once existed. Look at the way he's saying it. They once existed &gt;&gt; and they come into people and give them a nature. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So they got kicked out. Now just to be blunt now laying all this out, they kick got dis dislocated from their body. They they got tooken away. Why? Because Lucifer was all light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He couldn't keep that light. He was a lightbearer of God's own spirit. And God's like, I'm separating you from my spirit. &gt;&gt; I'm separating you from from everything good from from this earthly or this heavenly body. &gt;&gt; And he separates them. And now what are they? Demon spirits. Brother Brandham says now in adoption preached in 1960 he says adoption two he says and we just all be just that's exactly the truth if this earthly tabernacle now the look at how he says it if this earthly tabernacle of habitation now if you read that scripture it doesn't say habitation but brother Brandham says habitation be dissolved we have one already waiting &gt;&gt; so let's go to that scripture and see why brother Brandham said habitation. 2 Corinthians 5. I'm I'm trying not to be as uh confusing. I'm I'm trying to just lay it out. I pray that God &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; reveals it. 2 Corinthians 5 1:4. Now, this is a beautiful scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is talking about when we die, where do we go? What happens to our body? Are we spirits? &gt;&gt; Right? This is a great question. Brother Brandham had that question. &gt;&gt; He says, "For we know that our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved. We have a building of God." Now, think about it. He's talking about a house. He's talking about a temple. He's talking about habitations here. &gt;&gt; But we know what he's talking about. It's a body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "If this this earthly house, who's that? You and I, this body of this tabernacle were dissolved. We have a building. Something's already up there. &gt;&gt; Of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. &gt;&gt; For in this we grown earnestly, desiring. Now look at what it says. To be clothed. What was Lucifer? He was covered &gt;&gt; to be clothed with our house. Now that word house is that same word okitarian, that dwelling place for the spirit which is from heaven. If that it so be uh be if it so that be clothed that we shall not be found now listen what he says naked we for we are in this tabernacle we do groan being burdened not for what we would uh be unclothed but be clothed upon that mortality might swallow be swallowed up by life. &gt;&gt; Now clothes what does it refer to? It refers to the spiritual body of a believer. &gt;&gt; Correct? &gt;&gt; And he says, you know what? I I &gt;&gt; I'm not I don't desire to be unclothed or naked. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Which means I don't want to be a what? A floating spirit. &gt;&gt; He said, I don't want to be naked. I don't want to be a floating spirit. He says, but God promised us another body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So that when I die from this ground or my body goes to the ground, I go and I go to another body. Brother Brandham called it a theophony. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says there's already a heavenly body out there. It's our &gt;&gt; theophony. &gt;&gt; Now remember, whenever the resurrection comes, what happens? That teapony comes back and touches ground with that earth and now it's a glorified body. &gt;&gt; Correct. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we don't want to be found naked. We don't want to be found what? As spirits, &gt;&gt; kicked out of this body and just be what? Floating spirits. What? Desiring &gt;&gt; to be clothed. &gt;&gt; Desiring to to want to dwell into something. So to be found naked is is is a shame, right? That's right. &gt;&gt; Anybody could say that with their right mind. It's illegal. &gt;&gt; So when we die, we have a body waiting because we don't want to be illegally roaming in this ground in this earth. &gt;&gt; Why? God gave the dominion to the spirit, but he needed a body to touch the ground. &gt;&gt; So that he can have the dominion. So he gave the spirit dominion, but he gave the body so that he can work. So when the spirit is out, it's illegal. &gt;&gt; It's wrong. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham or or Paul says it it's you're naked. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here, brother Brandham says here, I'm just going to um read this because brother Brandham um we're going to see what is in his mind, how he felt here in uncertain sound in 61. He says, "Oh, I thought I always wanted to live um to live to see Jesus come because I never wanted to be a spirit." &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; I always was afraid of spooks and I didn't want to die because I didn't want to become a little cloud and and like a little white cloud floating around somewhere and see my brother and say, "Oh, there they are. Wished I could shake hands with him." Um but they they haven't gotten hand to shake with. is dead and and they're in the grave. And then I was made alive. Then um then was made alive that scripture. He goes back to the scripture we just read. If this earthly be earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So even brother Brandham gave his thoughts. I don't want to be a spirit. &gt;&gt; That's not the way. So to be found naked is that illegal and that's why we die. We have a body. So you cannot dwell in these natural dimensions as a spirit. &gt;&gt; God made a body so that you can your spirit God's spirit can operate in the earth. So when a body dies the spirit goes to a certain dimension depending on how they used to be and and and how they use that body. That's why it's important how are we using this temple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; However using you're using this body that's where your spirit's going. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right? But remember your your your spirit it cannot stay there. Your even the body one day is wanting to come back because in the end of the day we are terrestrial creatures. We're not like the angels. &gt;&gt; So wherever they're at in this sixth dimension with this body, they're not at they're not satisfied. &gt;&gt; Do you know that man? I just want to be a teophony. Well, that's not the way God made us. He wanted us to be glorified bodies. &gt;&gt; What does it mean? We could go through walls. We can go interdimensional. Yet, we can drink a bottle of water if we wanted to. That's what Jesus did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus, what? His spirit went down to hell. His body was in the grave. And then they both met and he's like, "Man, I'm awfully hungry." Man, in his resurrection, that's all he was doing. &gt;&gt; Hey, break some bread. We're going to eat. Hey, cook the fish. We're going to eat. &gt;&gt; All right, I got to go. I'm walking through this wall. &gt;&gt; It's a different body. So, when we're up there in heaven, we're not satisfied because that's not we were not made like the angels to be just theophanes or to be uh spiritual bodies, &gt;&gt; right? So, so I realized that even though we grown for our new house, um this is where our hope is. This is where our grace, this is even in this body when we desire to be changed. Remember that this is where your decisions are going to matter. &gt;&gt; In this body, &gt;&gt; that's that's dying, that gets sick, that cries, that has all this emotion that that has all everything running through it. &gt;&gt; In this body, this is where it matters wherever you go. Right? So, I'm going to skip a few things. So Satan and his angels, they're essentially living this earth illegally. Then &gt;&gt; because what are they? Spirits roaming around. &gt;&gt; What are they? Desiring to enter into a body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the greatest battle ever fought, "A devil is almost harmless unless he has something to work in." &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; So these things are harmless. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Unless they can get into a body. &gt;&gt; That's correct. What happened to the man of Gadra? &gt;&gt; The the these all the this legion was on him. And when the Oh, this is just a beautiful thing. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Where where one possessed man saw the other possessed man. &gt;&gt; This possessed man who was possessed of all these spirits finally saw God in human flesh. And when they saw him, they bowed and they said, "It's not time yet." Amen. &gt;&gt; I know you reserved uh judgment for us, but it's not time yet, Lord. He's like, "Get out of him." &gt;&gt; He kicked those devils out. &gt;&gt; And what did those spirits do? They said, "Well, can I go to the pigs?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What What were they? They're unagit. They cannot live and operate without a body. &gt;&gt; And when they went into those pigs, they went and the pigs went crazy. &gt;&gt; What does the Bible say? When an unclean spirit here in Luke uh 11:24 and 26, when an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he walketh in what? Dry places. &gt;&gt; Seeking what? Rest. He's not happy. &gt;&gt; The devil's not happy. He's seeking rest. &gt;&gt; Finding none. He said, "I will return back to a borrowed house." &gt;&gt; What did he say? I'm going back to my house. &gt;&gt; Am I the house of the devil? He says, "I'm going back." He claimed he's trying to claim your body. &gt;&gt; He's trying to claim the people's body. He says, "I'm going back to my house." &gt;&gt; And when he he cometh and find it swept and garnished, he goeth and take him up seven other spirits more wicked than himself and enter in and dwell therein. The last state of the man was worse than the first. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So they cannot live without human beings. They were whatever happened in heaven, they were stripped from what they had, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And now they're they're trying to to live &gt;&gt; in human beings. That's why one of these days, Brother Baron says, there'll be a superhuman on earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's going to take over this this whole earth. That's correct. &gt;&gt; What was it? It was it was the devil just like in Cain. He's he's completely uh possessed in a man. &gt;&gt; Right. So if a if a demon could simply materialize, he would always cause havoc with humanity. But it wouldn't be constantly looking for somebody to to inhabit. So it's further indication that demons cannot appear at will in some uh humanike or some animal. He they have to allow him to be there. &gt;&gt; Right? So now going into it now I I want to speed up because I don't want to go into this because there's a good part of this, right? &gt;&gt; Um here why does Satan have the right? God created man in his image. &gt;&gt; God says man is in I made him for my temple. &gt;&gt; I made him in my image so that I can dwell in him. Why does he have the right to be a temp to uh make us his temple? make people his temple. Brother Brandham says in exposition of the seven church ages, Ephesians church age, he says, "Now, why did it have to be so?" Why is it that the seed of the serpent must come out this way? Man was created for God. &gt;&gt; Correct? &gt;&gt; Man was to be a temple of God, &gt;&gt; the place of God's rest. The Holy Spirit was man, the temple. Acts Acts 7:46-51 who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for Jacob but Solomon built a house. How be it the most high dwelleth not in the temples made with hands sayeth the prophet. Heaven is my throne and earth is my foottool. What house will you build me? Sayeth the Lord. Or what is the place of my rest? Hath not my hand made all these things? Then then um he says ye stiff necked uncircumcised in the hearts and ears always do resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did. So do ye. Now brother Barham says Satan has known this all along. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew why man was supposed was made the way he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows why you're so special. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He also wants to indwell man even as God does. But God has reserved himself that right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the devil, he could not enter into man. &gt;&gt; God reserved that right for himself. Satan cannot do that. God alone appeared in human flesh. Satan could not do that. He does not have creative powers. The only way, now listen to this, the only way for Satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was enter the serpent of in Eden. Even as he entered into by evil spirits into the swine of gadra, God does not enter animals. But Satan can will can and will to do his to accomplish his ends. &gt;&gt; He could not have a child directly by Eve as as God did by Mary. So he entered into the serpent and begiled Eve. He seduced her by um by her. Did Satan have a child vicariously? So listen to this. Cain bore the full spiritual characteristics of Satan and anim animalistic central fleshly characteristics of the serpent. &gt;&gt; No wonder the Holy Spirit said Cain was of that wicked one. &gt;&gt; So why did he how was he able to have that right? was because he deceived Eve and he mixed those seeds. &gt;&gt; And now every person is is if if they're not careful, if they don't ask for the Holy Spirit, they're they're going to have to be dwelt, something's going to dwell in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz we are temples. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it was because of that situation, &gt;&gt; the devil's able to come. &gt;&gt; The devil's able to torment people with sicknesses. The devil's able to torment people with mental illnesses and all those things. Why? Because he entered into the human race by injecting himself through the serpent. &gt;&gt; And when he she had Cain, he bore the full characteristics of Satan. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; And then what happened? Well, we, you know, just to give a little context, then the children of men &gt;&gt; were were born and all the daughters of men were there. And then Seth's lineage came. Sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair. And there was a mixture that happened. &gt;&gt; There was a mixture that happened. Now, everybody is born in this sinful evil nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was carried outside of the ark and the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham says in the true sign that's overlooked, he says, "But those who sometimes their soul is saved, but this old body belongs to Satan." And he knows that he'll take he'll take it at the end time. He'll crush it and send it back um till bugs and earth will crawl and eat it up. But he'll never touch the soul for its precious treasures of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And through that life like out of a leaf, it returns back to God who give it will come forth in the next season with a new body that Satan can never touch. &gt;&gt; Neither can that old age ever anything else ever touch it. It'll be a glorified body. We're looking for that Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So right now the devil, he'll he's going to throw sickness. &gt;&gt; He's going to try to make people depressed. He's going to try to cause anxiety. He's going to try to do those because he somehow he's got a little bit of that right. But one day, he's not going to be able to touch that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can see that in that contending for Moses' body. Why? He had the right &gt;&gt; he contended with with with Michael. He says, "This is my body. What are you doing?" And God, this is the amazing thing. God's like, "Now, I don't care. I don't I don't play by your rules." Amen. &gt;&gt; And what did he do? He took that body. Brother Brandham says that he was resurrected. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even though saying no, that's you haven't died on the cross yet. &gt;&gt; You haven't resurrected. How could you resurrect a man? Man, &gt;&gt; that's something that I don't even understand. &gt;&gt; How could a man be raptured before Jesus? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How could a body be resurrected in and and before Jesus? Praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; man. Only God knows. &gt;&gt; And the devil's like, "This is my right." So now you have this this great this shadow in the Old Testament of of people fighting for God, but but they're separated and and Satan feels like he has everything. He he's he's got human flesh. He he's making them into animals. And you see that today. &gt;&gt; You see people hating each other. This &gt;&gt; this story of just people hating each other for &gt;&gt; for religion, for for a different color, for for having a different thought, for having a different political view. People are hating each other. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; There's there's a genuine hatred. And what is it? It's it's the devil &gt;&gt; just pulling the strings. It's the devil doing all these things, making people like this, &gt;&gt; making people weak, making people hate, making people lie, making people cheat, making people do these things. The devil's doing that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The devil thinks he has control. &gt;&gt; The devil thinks he could do all these things. Oh, I got the control. I can do whatever I want. &gt;&gt; I deceived my way. And then you just see the world and it's just such a sad situation in this world. &gt;&gt; There's this picture that I was thinking of actually when I was I was here last night. I think it's called Agnes. Some people call it Agnes Day, which is the lamb of God. And it's this lamb. I think it was painted in 19202. And it's this lamb just this peaceful little lamb with with a halo, a golden halo over himself and just these seven wolves just tearing it to pieces. &gt;&gt; One on the foot, the other one on the chest, the other one on the neck and these all these wolves are looking at this lamb and and in their eyes there's that golden light that is reflecting from that halo. And I started to think I said, "You know what? That's our human nature. When Christ came down, Christ didn't come down as as this great Caesar. He didn't come as this great conqueror. Let's we're going to change the nations and we're going to do this and he came as a little lamb. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; His nature was different because there was no evil. There was no inherent devil in there. &gt;&gt; There was just God in flesh. &gt;&gt; And he began to show the true beauty of God's character. Not outward beauty, not fleshly beauty. It was a character inside. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; He showed what true humanity should be. &gt;&gt; A man filled with the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; having dominion with the in the earth. And how did he do it? I am the greatest. I am the best. I will conquer all things. No, he was a little lamb. And all the wolves, that's me. &gt;&gt; All the evil, that's me, &gt;&gt; was looking at him. All of my sins, put him in that cross. &gt;&gt; All of my hatred, &gt;&gt; they did &gt;&gt; put him in that cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything that I've done, put him in that cross. &gt;&gt; Everything that you've done. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm I don't do anything wrong. &gt;&gt; God knows. &gt;&gt; God knows every single little thing. &gt;&gt; And you know what? Us, we put him there &gt;&gt; on that cross. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, now I just love the picture of John crying there in in Revelations, seeing seeing this picture, this in symbol form of this earth and what's going on and and seeing that no one was worthy to take the book of redemption, &gt;&gt; this this get the right back to man. And and John is looking at this in symbol form and he's crying. He begins to cry. He says, "Nobody's worthy. &gt;&gt; I know my name's in that book and I'm done. Nobody's worthy." And as he's crying, an elder says, "Don't cry." He says, "The lamb is worthy." &gt;&gt; He actually says, "The lion of the tribe of Judah." And when he looked when he looked at trying to look for the greatest king ever, he saw a slang lamb. Amen. &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:21 it says, "And ye were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by by your wicked works. Yet now he hath he reconciled &gt;&gt; in a body of his flesh through death to represent you holy and unblamable &gt;&gt; and unreprovable in his sight." &gt;&gt; How did he reconcile me? In a body. Yeah, &gt;&gt; God had to come the legal way. &gt;&gt; Correct? &gt;&gt; See, Brother Brandham says the devil's almost harmless if he doesn't have something. But then he says God does the same way. He says he's depending on us to work through. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God can't do anything unless he has a body to work through. And he came down in a form of a human flesh. He came down in the body of Jesus Christ to help. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says, "If you'd like to stand with me and the musicians would come." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "A little while from then, the world was going to receive the greatest gift that he ever received. Lord, &gt;&gt; a little package wrapped up." &gt;&gt; A little first Christmas package that was ever wrapped in the world, God wrapped it up. Yes. &gt;&gt; I want to break in in on my thought and say this that the greatest thing that ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it. God himself wrapped himself his own self in a Christmas package and sent to the world. &gt;&gt; He also says in why he had to be a shepherd. He says let us just close our eyes and think of Jehovah. No one was worthy. No one could no one but could do it but him. He come down become a little baby. Think about it. A a little baby wrapped the whole eternal God. &gt;&gt; He become a little baby. He come a a teenager and he become a carpenter and a working man. &gt;&gt; He became a lamb. &gt;&gt; He became a sacrificed. He raised triumphy as Jehovah. And as Moses pulled his hand from the first of uh from his bosom over his heart, God pulled his hand from the bosom of his secret. His son was smitten with disease and sin unccurable. He stuck it back in his bosom again and he pulled it forth and extended to you and I. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. God wrapped himself in and into into flesh all of eternity restrained in a human being. He put himself into subjection to the flesh of and to sickness to sorrow to tiredness to everything we're expecting experiencing. He felt it when it was the most critical time when the devil had the whole world in his hands. God came the legal way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why everything we do, we do it in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There the Bible says in unveiling of God, he says now he was behind the veil. He was behind what? Skin veil. See badger skins behind that veil. And there the veil was rent on the day of crucifixion. Now the best thing of a a gift is is opening up the wrapping paper. &gt;&gt; He he wrapped it up and he says here the veil is rent &gt;&gt; on the day of crucifixion. &gt;&gt; He says that and and that veil was rent on the day of crucifixion. That veil that he was wrapped in was rent on that day of crucifixion. whole the whole mercy seat came to view because he died because he became flesh. He died for our sins. Now all of mercy is in view. Not only that, but now now it's not Christ over there. Now it's not Emanuel, God with us. But now it could be God in us. &gt;&gt; Now you are that earthn vessel. &gt;&gt; You are that gift to the world. True. &gt;&gt; You are that temple that God wants to dwell in. Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Now you become part of him. &gt;&gt; You veve all of eternity inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says that he was God's wrapped package and then it was opened and then he rewrapped it again in the sons of God. He says &gt;&gt; there was one time where Philip asked Christ, he says, "Let us see God. Let us see the father." &gt;&gt; Jesus looked at him and he says, "Haven't haven't I been with you for so long." &gt;&gt; When you see me, you see the father. &gt;&gt; Brother, don't we want to see God? &gt;&gt; Look around. Look around at a genuine Christian. &gt;&gt; When you see them, you see the Father. &gt;&gt; When you see them, you see Christ. &gt;&gt; Because Christ is here to dwell in you, to operate through you to bring back everything that was lost. He's redeeming it back through his bride. Let us bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just want to give you the honor and the glory. What a horrible scene that we've we're not only seeing, but we're living through, Father. All this this backbiting, this evil, this hate that we look we look for to our left, we look to our right, we look front and back, and we just see hatred, we see evil. But God, you reserved souls. You reserved people to shine the light. Your light, Father, your treasure, your gift. Lord, I ask that each and every person here is a recipient of that. Each and every person is that lightbearer. Each and every person is that person that bears the Holy Spirit and wherever they go, they're showing not beauty but the character of God. Lord, I thank you, Jesus. I thank you for them, Father. And I thank you for the beautiful day when you came, Father. All of heaven, all of earth was rejoicing in that day. We thank you Jesus. We give you the glory and the honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's just sing this worship hymn together. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah.

The Bible say no greater love than this that he that the father that God himself. No greater love than this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That God loves me. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you for that great love. Thank you for that wonderful love for us, for the world. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, because you have prepared an habitation for us. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Father. We are grateful, Lord, for everything you've done. We appreciate you because when I see my brother, I see the glory of God in him. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Thank you for giving yourself to us. The Bible says it's not because we first loved him, but because he first loved us. We thank you for that love. And we appreciate you, Lord, for how you used your son, our brother, to reveal the deep secrets, &gt;&gt; revelation from the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We are grateful today and we're happy that you found us. &gt;&gt; We're happy that you dwell in us. We give you glory, Lord. We are so grateful, Father. We honor your name. Thank you because the devil does not have the right to dwell in us &gt;&gt; because you reserve the right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. We are grateful Lord and we pray Lord that we ourselves will not give the devil a place in us. &gt;&gt; We will not allow the devil to come into us and Lord we give up. We open up our hearts &gt;&gt; that you come in into your habitation. &gt;&gt; Come and dwell here Lord. Come and dwell in us Lord. Not just in the building, but I will carry you everywhere. But I will take you everywhere. But I will show forth that glory of yours to the world around us and shine that light. Cuz Christ say we are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hidden. Lord, I pray that our life will not be hidden &gt;&gt; from the darkness of this world. Lord, you will shine forth your light. You will show forth your glory and we will live to honor you. And Lord, as we dismiss, I pray, Lord, will be carriers of your glory. We will go with you everywhere. We take you everywhere, Lord.
