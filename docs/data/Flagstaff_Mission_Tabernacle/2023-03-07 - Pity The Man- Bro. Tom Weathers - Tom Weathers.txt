TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign man in this world who must use the Earth for a bit I guess we should pity the man who must toil From Dawn till Dusk for his bread may be rich and if they have contentment in Sharing God's salvation plan but if you know any who though they have plenty if they're lost pity the man pity the man who has Treasures to hold yet he owns not the pearl of great price [Music] oh pity the man though he lives long on Earth though he knows not The Giver of Life doctor lawyer traveler or Merchant a builder who builds on the sand upper or King to be saved is the thing if he's lost then pity the man oh I guess there are those pity the Saints as though they're missing life's best or getting the treasures of Earth pass away and that Heavens the place to invest foreign those who are seeming to hold all the wealth that they can but if while they're living to God they're not giving their soul pity the man pity the man who has Treasures to hold yet he owns not the pearl of great price oh pity the man though he lives Along on Earth yet he knows not The Giver of Life doctor traveler or Merchant a builder who builds on the sand popper or King to be saved is the thing if he's lost then pity the man popper or King to be saved is the thing if he's lost pity the man foreign [Music]
