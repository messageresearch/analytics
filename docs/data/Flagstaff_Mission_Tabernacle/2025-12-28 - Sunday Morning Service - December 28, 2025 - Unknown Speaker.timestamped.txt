[43:31] of voices
[43:33] are swelling [singing and music]

[43:52] [singing and music]
[43:54] worthy,
[43:58] [music]
[43:59] [singing]
[43:59] worthy.
[44:01] The lamb
[44:03] that [singing] was slain.
[44:07] [music]
[44:09] Then all
[44:11] the archangels, [singing]
[44:14] [music] the saints of all time,
[44:19] holding [singing]
[44:21] their crumbs [music]
[44:24] in their hands,
[44:30] fall [singing] down
[44:32] before him,
[44:35] [music] joining [singing]
[44:37] the song.
[44:40] Worthy,
[44:42] worthy [singing]
[44:44] is the lamb.
[44:49] Oh, worthy, [singing]

[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's worthy of all our praise.
[46:00] Uh while the offering was the offering
[46:02] prayer was being prayed, that song came
[46:05] to my mind and I was going to sing it
[46:08] and then I just turned and felt stopped
[46:10] and have sister Cammy play a different
[46:12] song and that was why. But I still think
[46:14] that we should stand as the pastor comes
[46:17] and let's just sing it to him. Just tell
[46:19] him how worthy he is. Just love him.
[46:22] Just serve him. Just just worship.
[46:24] [music] And I'm not I'm not trying to
[46:27] pull, but I do do believe that we should
[46:30] worship like it was our last
[46:32] opportunity.
[46:35] Listen to the word like it was our last
[46:37] opportunity.
[46:40] If it if I was [music] going to have a
[46:42] conversation with somebody one last
[46:44] time, I would get as deep as I could. I
[46:47] would tell them I love them.
[46:50] And so I just want to do that now as the
[46:52] pastor [music] comes. Just even if you
[46:54] don't sing, maybe just raise your hand,
[46:56] tell him how much you love him or he's
[46:59] worthy of it all. Amen.
[47:03] Worthy.
[47:07] You're worthy.
[47:11] [music]
[47:13] Oh, worthy.
[47:16] The lamb [singing and music]
[47:18] that was slain.
[47:24] Worthy. [music]
[47:28] Oh, [singing] you're worthy. [music]
[47:34] Oh, worthy.
[47:37] The [singing and music] lamb
[47:39] that was slain.
[47:42] Worthy. [music]
[47:44] Oh, you're worthy.
[47:48] [music]
[47:49] Yes, you're [singing] worthy.
[47:52] [music]
[47:55] Oh, worthy.
[47:59] The lamb [singing and music]
[48:01] that was slain.
[48:06] Oh worthy. [music]
[48:11] Oh worthy.
[48:15] [music]
[48:17] Oh worthy.
[48:20] The lamb
[48:22] that was slain. Love him. Love him. Make
[48:26] it personal. Sing I love you. I love
[48:29] you. [music]
[48:32] Oh, I love you. [music]
[48:38] I love [singing]
[48:41] the [music] lamb
[48:43] that was slain.
[48:46] [singing]
[48:49] Oh, I love you. [music]
[48:54] I love you.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[48:59] &gt;&gt; I love
[49:02] the lamb [singing]
[49:04] [music]
[49:04] that was slain.
[49:07] He's worthy.
[49:10] Oh worthy,
[49:15] [music]
[49:16] worthy.
[49:21] [music]
[49:22] worthy
[49:24] lamb
[49:26] that was [music]
[49:30] bless you this morning. I think we
[49:32] should just go right to the word and if
[49:34] you have your Bibles, turn with me to
[49:37] the book of Job, the 14th chapter. Job
[49:41] chapter 14.
[49:44] Read a few of the beginning verses
[49:46] there.
[49:48] Good to see everyone out this morning.
[49:51] Came prepared because we've been having
[49:53] trouble with some of the microphones.
[49:56] So, I came up with an extra pair of
[49:58] batteries.
[50:00] So, if we have to put them in, we'll
[50:01] just put them in and keep going. Um,
[50:06] thank the Lord. This yesterday we had um
[50:09] [clears throat]
[50:10] funeral for sister Vivian. It's
[50:13] interesting. The Lord allowed her to
[50:14] come here for about six months and we
[50:17] didn't know but it would be the last six
[50:19] months that she would be here on earth.
[50:21] And uh I posted something on our page
[50:25] yesterday. There was about four minutes
[50:27] of songs
[50:28] uh in Navajo that they sung during the
[50:32] service and it really blessed my heart.
[50:34] If you want to go online and look at
[50:35] that, there was probably 200 250
[50:40] believers Navajo brothers and sisters
[50:42] here yesterday and filled up the
[50:44] building and sang in Navajo and really
[50:46] blessed my heart listening to him and I
[50:48] don't know, Lord has a he's got a great
[50:50] purpose. Yes, she does.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; The piano player said she hadn't played
[50:54] the piano in six years and her parents
[50:56] have been praying for her to come back
[50:57] to the Lord. And she played and then she
[51:00] went downstairs and played for three
[51:01] hours. And at the end she said she said
[51:05] I my heart is just something changed in
[51:08] it when I was playing and it just she
[51:10] didn't know how to express it. But what
[51:11] she was saying was that her soul was
[51:13] healed
[51:14] &gt;&gt; uh when she got to play and be in the
[51:16] presence of the Lord. She had been away
[51:17] from him for a long time. So God is
[51:19] doing something and I just believe it
[51:21] and I see it with our brothers and
[51:24] sisters and I I pray that he just
[51:26] continue. We don't know why he sent
[51:28] brother Fritz here. We don't know why he
[51:30] sent sister Vivian here. We don't know
[51:32] but he has a great purpose and we
[51:34] believe it. And so they asked me to
[51:37] speak the message which I took was a
[51:38] great privilege being that she was only
[51:41] here a few months and she had told her
[51:44] daughter that she liked our preaching.
[51:46] So, I don't know how good her
[51:47] discernment. No, I'm just but she but
[51:50] she says she she liked it. We might have
[51:52] you do the message. And I I there's a
[51:55] couple messages brother Brandon
[51:56] preaches. There are funerals. One is for
[51:58] Garnet Peak and there's another one. And
[52:00] I got the inspiration from that. And
[52:02] then this morning it was kind of I
[52:04] couldn't get away from it, you know. So,
[52:06] it's not a funeral service, but a
[52:08] funeral service is actually for the
[52:10] believer. It's a celebration.
[52:12] So, we want uh to celebrate this
[52:15] morning, even though we're missing our
[52:17] sister, but let's let's focus on what we
[52:20] have, which is uh promise uh first
[52:24] fruits. What did Paul call it? The It's
[52:28] like the the down payment. What did he
[52:30] call it? Earnest.
[52:32] We have the earnest of that
[52:34] resurrection. So, praise the Lord. Job
[52:37] in the 14th chapter and just read the
[52:40] first couple verses. He says, "Man that
[52:42] is born of a woman is of few days and
[52:46] full of trouble. He cometh forth like a
[52:49] flower and is cut down. He fleth also as
[52:53] a shadow and contin
[52:58] thou open thine eyes upon such an one
[53:01] and bringest me into judgment with
[53:03] thee." He asked a great question there.
[53:06] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we
[53:08] thank you this morning. Lord, I in my
[53:11] spirit I really wanted to be out here as
[53:13] the congregation was worshiping, but uh
[53:16] could just feel your presence already,
[53:18] Lord, in the back room. Just one person,
[53:20] Lord, just one amen would change the
[53:23] entire
[53:25] uh service, Lord, the entire anointing
[53:27] that would come. And so, we thank you
[53:28] for that, Lord. And you, as Isaac said,
[53:30] you sent two or three this morning. We
[53:33] thank you for every heart that's
[53:34] gathered here, Lord. They come here with
[53:36] a need. We don't know what that need is,
[53:38] but you've already prepared the the the
[53:40] way to meet the need, the gift that that
[53:43] need would need. Lord, you've already
[53:44] prepared it. We don't know what it is.
[53:46] And but we thank you for that ahead of
[53:48] time. We'd ask you to speak to our
[53:50] hearts this morning. Be with us, Lord.
[53:52] Be with us in spirit and through the
[53:54] truth of your word. In Jesus Christ's
[53:56] name we pray. Amen. You may be seated.
[53:58] And as another announcement, I'm sure
[54:01] brother Isaac mentioned it. We haven't
[54:02] done a watch night New Year's Eve in
[54:04] many, many years. I can't remember. I
[54:06] felt it on my heart to do it again. So,
[54:08] that's why I know it's late. I'm going
[54:10] to take a nap halfway through the day to
[54:12] make sure I can stay up myself. And so,
[54:15] we'll start at 10:30. And then we're
[54:16] going to have some of the the ministers
[54:17] and the deacons, brother Mitchell, that
[54:20] includes you and might have brother
[54:22] Brandon or whoever's here, the young men
[54:25] that's got little little I say little.
[54:27] It's a gift from God. You have gifts in
[54:29] your life. And so, we'll have you talk
[54:30] and and take five or 10 minutes to talk
[54:32] to the congregation. Brother Ryan should
[54:35] be back. He's in Colorado this morning.
[54:36] And I failed to mention Brother Tom.
[54:38] Actually, I'm going to say a quick
[54:40] prayer for Brother Tom. He's homesick
[54:41] this morning with bronchitis. So, we
[54:44] want to remember brother Tom in prayer.
[54:46] Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly
[54:47] Father, Lord, forgive me. But you
[54:49] allowed it to be brought to my mind
[54:50] again about our brother and sister at
[54:52] home, Lord, at Bronitis. And so, we'd
[54:54] ask that you'd touch their bodies, be
[54:56] with them, Lord, wherever they would be
[54:58] at home or wherever. just just send your
[55:01] ministering angels and spirits to them
[55:03] in this moment. In Jesus Christ's name
[55:05] we pray. Amen. And also, Brother George
[55:09] Smith announced a trip to Israel, April
[55:11] 26th or May 10th. There's two of them.
[55:14] Uh I've encouraged you to go if you' if
[55:17] you'd want to. Uh April 26th, the first
[55:20] one. They go for about 10 days or 12
[55:22] days. And then May 10th starts the
[55:25] second one or May 11th. So, if you can
[55:27] go to Israel with Brother George, I'm
[55:29] sure that you'd appreciate it. Who's
[55:30] been? I know Brother Curt, Sister
[55:31] Olivia's been, Brother Ray, Sister
[55:33] Kathy, a few of you has been. Brother
[55:35] Isaac and I went a few years ago. So,
[55:38] uh, if you can make that, just ask us
[55:40] for a flyer. Job
[55:43] in to start a funeral service. It was it
[55:46] seemed kind of odd. I apologized. And
[55:49] yesterday I had an interpreter and it
[55:50] was a Navajo interpreter and I've never
[55:53] and it seemed like he took longer to
[55:55] explain things which is understandable
[55:57] cuz it's, you know, they don't have
[55:58] everything that we have in our English.
[56:00] So maybe he took a little while to to
[56:02] explain it. And so it was odd. And so I
[56:03] I kind of had a little bit left over if
[56:06] I could say that this morning of
[56:08] anointing or just just the thought on
[56:10] this. And and Job says man that's born
[56:13] of woman is of few days. And then he
[56:16] talks about the invited guest that is
[56:18] actually here with us this morning
[56:20] because no matter what you would you
[56:22] would you would say the Lord is with us
[56:24] this morning. We invited him and he's
[56:26] here. Whether two or three are gathered,
[56:27] he's here. But there's also the thought
[56:31] of an uninvited guest or a guest that we
[56:33] know is going to come at some point. If
[56:35] if if the Lord with Terry, uh there's
[56:38] been nobody that's been able to defeat
[56:40] death but the Lord Jesus and Enoch, I
[56:42] guess. And maybe there might be one
[56:43] other I'm not thinking of, but but aside
[56:46] from that, death is is going to be there
[56:48] if the Lord carries. And it's going to
[56:50] be something that you're going to have
[56:52] to face. Now, Job calls it trouble, but
[56:54] the fact is that if the Lord carries,
[56:57] and I'm, you know, as you get older, I'm
[56:58] not old yet, but 48. So, I'm starting to
[57:00] approach that 50 and and then I can wait
[57:03] till you 55, I can get some discounts.
[57:05] And unfortunately, sometimes when I go
[57:07] to the restaurant, Brother Brandon, they
[57:09] look at me and they just already provide
[57:10] it. And so I appreciate that. That's
[57:13] fine. But you know, death is there and
[57:15] Job calls it troubles and sometimes we
[57:17] pre pre we we think it's not there or we
[57:20] pretend it's not there, but it is there.
[57:22] And you when you're 20, you don't think
[57:23] about it as much. But as you get older,
[57:25] you realize, you know, and as you you
[57:27] start last night with some of the kids,
[57:28] I went to play basketball a little bit
[57:30] and after about two runs to the basket
[57:32] and back, I was done. I was out of
[57:33] breath. Well, all that is is the
[57:35] beginnings of this body dying. That's
[57:37] just what it is. You just got to face
[57:39] it. That that that's what it is. and
[57:41] there's no escape from it if the Lord
[57:43] would terry. Now, if he doesn't tar,
[57:45] there's something else great that we'll
[57:47] talk about that could happen. But, but
[57:48] if he comes tomorrow and you're ready
[57:50] and you've been prepared and you've
[57:52] accepted the earnest of that
[57:54] resurrection, then guess what? You
[57:56] actually like Enoch get to escape the
[57:58] the death that would be there. But other
[58:00] than that, so so we don't want to face
[58:02] the fact sometimes that he's here. We
[58:04] would call him death, but Job calls him
[58:06] trouble. And and Job's going through a
[58:08] lot of trouble. He acknowledges him. He
[58:11] recognizes him. And the Bible says or
[58:13] brother Benham taught us, but the Bible
[58:15] uh concurs that uh that Job feared
[58:19] something and the and he says, "The
[58:21] thing that I greatly feared is come upon
[58:24] me." It's Job 3 and verse 25. I'm sorry
[58:27] I didn't get the scriptures to you,
[58:28] Sister Pauline, but Job 3 and verse 25.
[58:31] It says this, "For the thing which I
[58:33] greatly feared has come upon me, and
[58:35] that which I was afraid of is come upon
[58:38] me." So Job, those are two different
[58:40] Hebrew words. One is one is more like a
[58:42] dread, like a deep trembling fear, and
[58:44] the other one's something that you would
[58:46] be afraid of. And and so Job is afraid
[58:48] of these things, and he's he's done
[58:50] things in his life to prepare just in
[58:53] case it would happen. But but the fact
[58:55] of the matter is that there's a there's
[58:57] a special trial that's been prepared, as
[58:59] we mentioned many times, just for you.
[59:02] And and for Job, it was the the thing he
[59:04] greatly feared, and he tried to prepare
[59:06] as much as he could. And he, you know,
[59:08] he would even for his children, he would
[59:10] knew that that maybe they, Brother Bam
[59:12] said, they went and they married over
[59:13] here and they married over there and
[59:14] they went off where where he didn't
[59:16] think that they should have gone off and
[59:17] and so just in case they didn't lay down
[59:19] the sacrifice and burn it and offer it
[59:22] like they should, he offered one for
[59:24] him. So just to be sure, you know, he
[59:26] applied the token, if we could say it
[59:28] like that, just to be sure that his
[59:30] children, you know, he had everything in
[59:32] order. Brother Beam says this morning we
[59:34] turned over to Job. Mentally speaking,
[59:36] found Job living under the days of the
[59:38] offering and the burnt offering. And he
[59:39] thought maybe that because that his
[59:41] children might have sinned some way that
[59:43] they didn't understand that they had
[59:44] sinned. Job made a burnt offering for
[59:46] his children just to be sure. He says to
[59:49] be sure. I like that. Don't you interest
[59:51] in your children making a burnt
[59:53] offering. Offering. And now today it's
[59:55] like this. Lord, my children HAVE GONE
[59:57] OFF. LORD, THEY don't even know where
[59:59] they're at. They've lost their mind.
[1:00:00] They've gone a way that I don't think
[1:00:02] they should have gone. But then you
[1:00:04] offer up that prayer, you're doing no
[1:00:05] different THAN WHEN JOB LAID down the
[1:00:08] sacrifice of the LAMB AND HE PUT IT ON
[1:00:10] THE ALTAR AND he slayed it and he did
[1:00:12] THAT FOR HIS CHILDREN just to be sure,
[1:00:14] just in case that they didn't do it. He
[1:00:17] offered up a prayer, brother M says,
[1:00:18] under the sacrifice of a sheep's death
[1:00:21] that his children would not be lost if
[1:00:23] they had sinned, that God would forgive
[1:00:25] them of their sins. And and I'll give
[1:00:26] you a little secret this morning. The
[1:00:28] last couple weeks, uh, we've been in
[1:00:30] prayer and I put a list of all the
[1:00:32] children that I grew up with in this
[1:00:34] assembly that I don't see here anymore.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; And I counted over 30. I think it's like
[1:00:40] 35 that I grew up with that that they
[1:00:42] might have moved out. And you know what?
[1:00:44] I put them on a list and I wrote their
[1:00:46] name down. And I'm doing what Joette
[1:00:48] just in case Lord that that they there's
[1:00:50] they forgot or they went off or or or by
[1:00:53] circumstances many times in the church
[1:00:55] because because quite frankly men fail
[1:00:57] and then we look at the man and and then
[1:00:59] we see him fall and then we blame the
[1:01:01] man or the message because we saw the
[1:01:03] man fall and and so now it's the
[1:01:05] message's fault and we leave the message
[1:01:07] or we leave Christ altogether if we
[1:01:09] could say it like that. And and so many
[1:01:10] of my friends has done that. they seen
[1:01:12] that that something and they put the
[1:01:13] blame on, you know, the message or they
[1:01:16] put the blame ON CHRIST. WELL, I'M
[1:01:17] OFFERING A sacrifice for them. You know,
[1:01:19] I had one brother on my list and and I'd
[1:01:22] just been praying for him for about a
[1:01:23] week and you KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? GOD PUT
[1:01:25] HIM IN MY PATH THE VERY next day at
[1:01:27] Safeway and I thought, "PRAISE GOD, YOU
[1:01:29] KNOW, GOD, I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR THIS
[1:01:30] BROTHER AND AT SAFEWAY, I JUST HAPPENED
[1:01:32] to run into him." I didn't just happen
[1:01:34] to RUN INTO HIM. I'VE BEEN OFFERING A
[1:01:36] SACRIFICE for that brother and God put
[1:01:38] him in my path. If you do that for your
[1:01:40] children, just to be sure.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, by the way, many of your children is
[1:01:44] on that list, too. Praise God. And I'm
[1:01:47] I'm not giving up on them.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; I pray that we just all of a sudden we
[1:01:51] just see them all walk through the
[1:01:52] building and we we just start offering
[1:01:54] up prayers for your children.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; God can do such a miracle. I mean, he
[1:01:59] can do a great miracle. So, Job does
[1:02:01] that and and he he's But see, there's
[1:02:03] something and I'm gonna just bear with
[1:02:05] me a minute because he's he's afraid of
[1:02:07] something. He says, "The thing that I
[1:02:09] feared come upon me." Well, what come
[1:02:12] upon him? He lost everything. And maybe
[1:02:15] that, you know, just losing everything
[1:02:16] was what he feared, but but it started
[1:02:19] out with the death of his children.
[1:02:21] Well, he had that covered, you know, he
[1:02:22] laid down the sacrifice and and he had
[1:02:25] done that. He put that under the token.
[1:02:26] He'd offered up for his children and so
[1:02:28] did that. And then, but he lost his
[1:02:30] cattle and his sheep and his oxen and
[1:02:32] his land, everything. You know, the
[1:02:33] enemy came in and burned it all and and
[1:02:36] so he lost that. Do you know he even
[1:02:38] lost his own his own skin?
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; I mean, he was sitting on the ash heap
[1:02:43] with a with a pot shirt, I think the
[1:02:45] Bible said, and he was scraping the
[1:02:47] boils. And and later on, he says
[1:02:49] something like this, "Though my skin
[1:02:51] worms will destroy this flesh." Well,
[1:02:53] guess what? He's probably looking at the
[1:02:56] very skin worms in the process of
[1:02:58] destroying his flesh. And he looks at
[1:03:00] HIM. HE SAYS, "NO, YOU GUYS WOULD
[1:03:03] DESTROY this flesh. in this very flesh
[1:03:06] I'll see my God. And so guess what? He's
[1:03:08] a He maybe was afraid that he would lose
[1:03:11] his very health.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Or maybe he was afraid his wife would
[1:03:14] turn against him.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; And all of those things happened
[1:03:20] everyone. He lost his children. He lost
[1:03:21] his property. He lost his economy if we
[1:03:23] could say it like that. He lost his he
[1:03:25] lo, you know, he lost his health and his
[1:03:27] wife turned against him.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; But death is really nothing to fear. And
[1:03:34] this morning, I want to I want to word
[1:03:35] it like this. I'm trying not to get too
[1:03:37] ahead of myself, but but there's
[1:03:39] something to be said for facing
[1:03:43] the fear that you have
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; for facing that thing.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz Job, it was like the thing that he
[1:03:50] greatly feared came upon him. Well, God
[1:03:52] put the thing that he greatly feared
[1:03:54] upon him right in front of him. So, he
[1:03:56] had to face it.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; But I wonder and not that you can escape
[1:04:00] it because you have to face it. whatever
[1:04:02] the thing is that you greatly fear. And
[1:04:05] I've had thing in in my own life, I've
[1:04:07] got things that I've feared in my life.
[1:04:09] And it just so happens that in the last
[1:04:12] several years, God has put the things
[1:04:13] that I greatly that I was afraid of and
[1:04:16] that MY WHOLE LIFE THAT I WOULD, YOU
[1:04:18] KNOW, THAT I would prevent that it
[1:04:20] wouldn't happen to me. Well, you can't
[1:04:22] prevent the thing that you greatly fear
[1:04:24] from HAPPENING TO YOU. GOD IS GOING TO
[1:04:25] [screaming] PUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
[1:04:26] FACE THE GREATEST fear that you have.
[1:04:30] And I know it's a it's a it's a it's a
[1:04:32] strong thought. I know that. But I'm
[1:04:34] tell I'm talking this morning from
[1:04:36] experience that the thing Job greatly
[1:04:39] feared the greatest anxiety that he had
[1:04:43] that his children might not make it or
[1:04:44] or that his wife would lose everything.
[1:04:47] THE GREATEST FEAR that he had come upon
[1:04:50] him. He had to face it. What is the fear
[1:04:53] that the anxiety that you have this
[1:04:55] morning? I was talking to a young man
[1:04:57] the other day and he began to pour out
[1:04:58] his heart. And you know, I understand
[1:05:00] young people, the the world is not like
[1:05:03] it was when when we when we grew up. You
[1:05:06] know, it's very different for you young
[1:05:07] people on the front row here. IT'S IT'S
[1:05:09] IT'S A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT than when we
[1:05:11] grew up. And now their whole system that
[1:05:14] the world had is created to put anxiety
[1:05:16] on you. And this young man was saying,
[1:05:18] "Well, I don't I don't know what I'm
[1:05:19] going to do if I don't make it through
[1:05:20] college. Can I have a job? I don't want
[1:05:22] to work fast food my whole life." and
[1:05:23] and then I can't, you know, I can't get
[1:05:24] married unless I have a job and I can't
[1:05:26] afford a house and and he began to pour
[1:05:28] out all these things and I be I began to
[1:05:30] understand and to intercede with him all
[1:05:32] the the anxiety and the fear and and the
[1:05:35] fact is you got to face that thing and
[1:05:38] you're not getting through it. You're
[1:05:39] not getting through that you don't have
[1:05:40] a house, you don't have a job and and
[1:05:42] you don't have a spouse, you don't have
[1:05:44] you're NOT GETTING THROUGH ALL THAT
[1:05:45] UNLESS YOU FACE that thing and then YOU
[1:05:47] DO ONE NOT just you face it because you
[1:05:49] try to face it alone, you lose.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. it's not going to make it. But
[1:05:54] when you face that thing, TAKE THE
[1:05:56] [screaming] LORD GOD ALMIGHTY WITH YOU
[1:05:59] AND TAKE HIM WITH YOU TO FACE THAT THING
[1:06:01] AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE. BUT BUT IF
[1:06:03] YOU TRY TO DO IT ALONE AND YOU SAY, YOU
[1:06:05] KNOW, I'M GOING TO GO get a job and and
[1:06:07] I'm going to make some money and I'm
[1:06:09] going to, you know, I'm going to buy a
[1:06:10] house and I'm going to get a wife and
[1:06:12] and I'm going to do these things, if you
[1:06:13] try to do it alone, you'll fail AND GOD
[1:06:16] WILL STRIP it all from YOU UNTIL YOU
[1:06:18] FACE IT WITH HIM AT YOUR SIDE.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; OKAY. So that's what happened
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; with Job. He was forced to face it. He
[1:06:26] was forced to to look him right in the
[1:06:28] eye and to have a battle face to face
[1:06:29] with that thing. He might have tried to
[1:06:31] to turn from it, but he lived a perfect
[1:06:33] life. But he might have he might have
[1:06:35] tried to turn from that thing and not
[1:06:37] face it. But God stripped everything
[1:06:39] from him and forced him to face the very
[1:06:42] fear that he had. The worst fear, the
[1:06:45] greatest fear, the great thing that he
[1:06:47] feared had come upon him. Jesus said in
[1:06:49] Matthew 10:28, he says, "Fear not them
[1:06:52] which kill the body." [sighs]
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Don't fear them. Jesus said, "Fear not."
[1:06:58] I don't know if I have it on a slide. I
[1:06:59] don't think I put it up, but he said,
[1:07:00] "Fear not." I think it was 24 times.
[1:07:03] Don't be afraid. Fear not. Or take
[1:07:05] courage. Don't be anxious. Those kind of
[1:07:07] things. He said that like 25 times. He
[1:07:10] said that more than don't sin. He said
[1:07:13] that more than don't judge. He said it
[1:07:16] more than don't be a hypocrite. I looked
[1:07:17] them all up. He said it more than don't
[1:07:19] do any other thing. He said don't fear
[1:07:21] or don't be afraid.
[1:07:23] So you got to face that thing. Not fear
[1:07:25] and turn and you got to face it. He said
[1:07:27] don't fear don't fear them which can
[1:07:30] kill the body but they're not able to
[1:07:31] kill the soul. So you might you know not
[1:07:34] be able to you know it's nice to have a
[1:07:36] house. It's certainly wonderful to have
[1:07:38] a spouse and uh most days no I'm just
[1:07:42] kidding. It's wonderful to have a
[1:07:43] spouse. It's wonderful to have a job.
[1:07:45] It's fantastic to have a you know you
[1:07:47] know all those things but NOW IF YOU
[1:07:51] DON'T have those don't worry about it
[1:07:53] cuz there's one that can kill the soul
[1:07:55] that you need to be afraid of. Jesus
[1:07:57] said fear him now. Not just be afraid
[1:08:00] cuz cuz you know God can't help you but
[1:08:02] but but you need to have a consecration
[1:08:04] to God. SO CUZ [screaming] THAT ONE
[1:08:06] RIGHT THERE IS AFTER YOU. SO so in the
[1:08:09] in THE IN THE RESPECT OF YOU KNOW FEAR
[1:08:11] THAT THING SO THAT YOU DON'T TURN TO
[1:08:13] HIM. JUST KEEP YOUR MIND FOCUSED on God.
[1:08:15] And he says, "Fear him that's able to bo
[1:08:17] to both destroy the soul and the body in
[1:08:20] hell.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; That's the thing.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, we we have preoccupations about
[1:08:25] whether or not I can buy a house or a
[1:08:26] whatever it might be, but but you need
[1:08:28] to fear the one that could destroy the
[1:08:30] soul." Brother Banner makes an
[1:08:32] interesting contrast here in and and in
[1:08:34] looking up your fear, facing that thing
[1:08:36] that that would make you worry or that
[1:08:38] would make you an anxious that would
[1:08:41] have you in depression. You know, the
[1:08:43] thing that would have you wondering
[1:08:44] about tomorrow, Jesus said, ' Don't
[1:08:46] worry about tomorrow. You know,
[1:08:47] sufficient for today is the evil
[1:08:49] thereof. The thing that has you
[1:08:50] questioning whether you you did the
[1:08:52] right thing in your past. Many times
[1:08:54] it's not. We're worried so much about
[1:08:55] tomorrow. But but we remember what we
[1:08:57] did in the past and it makes us anxious.
[1:08:59] Did we make the wrong mistake? Did we
[1:09:01] make the wrong decision? Did we choose
[1:09:02] wrong? And and all those past decisions,
[1:09:04] they begin to to kind of pile up and and
[1:09:07] and then then they make you anxious
[1:09:08] about, you know, you made the wrong
[1:09:10] decision in the past. Now your whole
[1:09:12] future is is and is is just you know
[1:09:14] worthless and or you know I'm worried
[1:09:16] about tomorrow but but let me tell you
[1:09:18] just focus on the present and don't
[1:09:20] worry about tomorrow. Don't worry about
[1:09:22] YOU KNOW THE FUTURE THAT you should
[1:09:23] worry about is the future of the soul
[1:09:25] that is placed on the inside of you and
[1:09:27] you won't get victory over those things
[1:09:31] until you stop worrying about it. Stop
[1:09:33] worrying about a past decision. If if
[1:09:35] you live 48 years you you lived a long
[1:09:37] long enough life. You made a lot of
[1:09:39] wrong decisions.
[1:09:41] Made a wrong decision this morning. I
[1:09:43] made a wrong one yesterday. Just go
[1:09:44] through them. But if I focus on all
[1:09:46] those I made that wrong decision and I
[1:09:48] made that other one and I made how many
[1:09:50] wrong decisions do I got to let pile up
[1:09:52] before depression comes in?
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about that. Put that behind
[1:09:56] you. Repent if you made a mistake and
[1:09:57] just keep marching forward. Righteous
[1:10:00] man falls seven times but he rises
[1:10:03] again. The Bible says okay so he makes a
[1:10:06] contrast here. Brother Bamab does of the
[1:10:07] Queen of Sheba and he says that she had
[1:10:11] to confront what was between her and
[1:10:16] Solomon. And he would call it back then
[1:10:17] the Ishelites. You know, he'd say all
[1:10:19] the Ishelite bands wherever thousand
[1:10:21] miles away or whatever she was between
[1:10:23] where she was and where Solomon was was
[1:10:26] a treacherous journey that she had to
[1:10:29] confront. Brother, the Bible says this
[1:10:32] at Matthew 12:42, "The queen of the
[1:10:34] south shall rise up in the judgment with
[1:10:37] this generation of and shall condemn it,
[1:10:40] for she came from the uttermost parts of
[1:10:42] the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon.
[1:10:46] And behold, a greater than Solomon is
[1:10:48] here." Now, another thing Brother says,
[1:10:52] she had all that wealth and the children
[1:10:53] of Ishmael was on the desert and they
[1:10:56] were robbers. What a setup. why they'd
[1:10:59] take that great group of fleefooted
[1:11:01] riders with their spears and ride on her
[1:11:03] little caravan there and murder them and
[1:11:05] have all that wealth to themselves. She
[1:11:07] had that to confront. Now, you don't
[1:11:10] have that to confront to come across the
[1:11:12] street or around the city or from some
[1:11:14] nearby place. You don't take three
[1:11:16] months though at a hot through a hot
[1:11:18] burning desert sitting on the back of a
[1:11:20] camel. Now, in all sincerity, I wonder
[1:11:21] tonight how many present would take that
[1:11:24] journey.
[1:11:25] But ours is a different journey. Yes, I
[1:11:28] do.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; It's a journey and it's just as
[1:11:30] treacherous, by the way. It's very, very
[1:11:32] treacherous. Her journey was a physical.
[1:11:35] She got on a camel with her caravan, but
[1:11:37] in between her there was a there was a
[1:11:39] lot of things that were that would have
[1:11:41] made her afraid to get to Solomon. And
[1:11:44] she had heard things and they were very
[1:11:46] good and and and what she had HEARD WAS
[1:11:48] SO GOOD THAT THAT she determined to take
[1:11:50] the journey. AND AND SO NOW IT'S LIKE
[1:11:53] THIS THAT THAT WHAT THAT WHAT HAS been
[1:11:55] presented to you in the way of THE
[1:11:56] GOSPEL IS SO GOOD. IT [screaming] OUGHT
[1:11:58] TO MAKE YOU CONFRONT THE FEAR OF THE
[1:12:01] journey that's before you. IT OUGHT TO
[1:12:02] GIVE YOU ENOUGH COURAGE
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; TO CONFRONT THAT FEAR. CONFACE that
[1:12:07] thing. Face that anxiety. Face the thing
[1:12:09] that makes you afraid
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; and realize well we'll read what she
[1:12:14] said in a minute. But realize that the
[1:12:16] journey is going to be well worth it
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; when you get to the end of the road. But
[1:12:20] I think the song goes when we get to the
[1:12:22] end of the road. Oh, it'll be it'll be
[1:12:24] worth it all. Notice what Chronicles 2
[1:12:27] Chronicles chapter 9. If we pull that
[1:12:29] up, she she goes to Solomon and the
[1:12:32] Bible says she said to the king, it was
[1:12:34] a true report. Verse 5, which I heard in
[1:12:37] my own land of thine acts and of thy
[1:12:40] wisdom. How be it, I believe not their
[1:12:42] words. I mean, think about it. She
[1:12:44] didn't even I mean she heard it but like
[1:12:46] it can't be true but she heard it enough
[1:12:48] you know she thought it might be worth
[1:12:49] taking the risk that I would that I
[1:12:51] would HAVE TO CONFRONT THE FEAR. Imagine
[1:12:53] if if she was a woman and and she had
[1:12:56] heard about Ishraelites killing her
[1:12:58] family her whole life. But you know SHE
[1:13:00] HAD TO CONFRONT THAT THING. She had to
[1:13:02] face that anxiety that fear that thing
[1:13:04] that made HER AFRAID TO TO COME AND BE A
[1:13:07] WORSHSHIPER of God Almighty. SHE
[1:13:09] CONFRONTED AND DETERMINED to take the
[1:13:11] journey.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; And she said, "Until I came and my eyes
[1:13:15] had seen it. I got to see it for
[1:13:17] myself."
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; And behold, the one half of the
[1:13:22] greatness of thy wisdom was not told me.
[1:13:25] She's saying, "Not I I wasn't even told
[1:13:28] half of it.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; For thou exceed the fame that I heard."
[1:13:33] Listen, we've heard about heaven. We've
[1:13:35] heard about a change of body audience
[1:13:37] and we've heard about a wedding supper.
[1:13:39] I don't think we've heard a half OF THE
[1:13:41] GREATNESS OF GOD THAT WE'RE GOING TO
[1:13:44] EXPERIENCE WHEN WE GET to the end of the
[1:13:46] road. And then now the Bible says she
[1:13:48] gave the king 120 talents of gold. And
[1:13:51] oh, I lost my place here. Excuse me. She
[1:13:53] gave the king 120 talents of gold. I
[1:13:55] think it's verse nine. And of spices,
[1:13:58] great abundance and precious stones.
[1:13:59] Neither was there any such spice as the
[1:14:01] Queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.
[1:14:05] You know, when you come here and you
[1:14:07] don't think it makes a difference maybe,
[1:14:09] but but if you just sit in the
[1:14:10] congregation and the music starts
[1:14:12] playing and and you start singing, you
[1:14:14] know, you maybe you let out a amen,
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; you have no idea how that changes the
[1:14:20] whole entire
[1:14:22] uh you know, it might just spirit was
[1:14:24] just waiting there to enter in and boom,
[1:14:26] it just entered in. You don't know what
[1:14:28] that will do if you just offer up
[1:14:30] something. And Solomon, the Bible says
[1:14:33] this in verse 12. And King Solomon gave
[1:14:35] to the Queen of Sheba all her desire.
[1:14:38] All her desire. Come on now. Whatever
[1:14:41] you would want, well, all her desire,
[1:14:42] whatsoever she asked beside that which
[1:14:44] she had brought unto the king. So she
[1:14:46] turned and went away. She and her
[1:14:47] servants. So, so whatever you desire
[1:14:49] this morning, now you got to face the
[1:14:51] thing that's in front of you. I don't
[1:14:53] know what it is. Maybe it's 2026. SEEMS
[1:14:56] LIKE YOU NEVER THOUGHT I would be here.
[1:14:57] I never thought I would be last year. I
[1:14:59] think I said this. I never thought I'd
[1:15:00] be here in 25 and 24 and said the same
[1:15:03] thing over and over and certainly I
[1:15:05] never thought we'd be here. I I've told
[1:15:06] this many times in 88, you know, I was
[1:15:09] 11. I thought, man, it's Billy Paul's
[1:15:11] getting old. It's got to be coming. Now
[1:15:13] he's passed on. And now I'm getting old.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; He's still got to be coming. Thank you,
[1:15:19] brother Joe. He's got one back there.
[1:15:20] He's also getting old. He's older, by
[1:15:22] the way, in case you were wondering.
[1:15:24] Okay. Now, Job is he's forced to
[1:15:26] confront.
[1:15:29] He says, "Man born of woman," and this
[1:15:31] is a true statement. He's of few days
[1:15:33] and and full of trouble. Oh, it's a I
[1:15:38] mean, we can all we can all say that,
[1:15:39] you know, we can all testify. And then
[1:15:40] he says, "He comes like a flower. He's
[1:15:42] he's cut down. He flees as a shadow. He
[1:15:45] doesn't continue. And dust thou open
[1:15:47] thine eyes upon such and one and
[1:15:49] bringest me under judgment with thee?
[1:15:51] Who can bring a clean thing out of an
[1:15:53] unclean?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Not one. His days are determined. The
[1:15:56] number of his months are with thee.
[1:15:58] Thou's appointed his bounds. He cannot
[1:16:00] pass. You know, he's appointed a time
[1:16:02] and a moment for each of us.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; That time might be tomorrow.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Could be the next day. It could be the
[1:16:09] next. We don't know it. There is an
[1:16:11] appointed time though. Might as well
[1:16:13] just face it. And if you can see, here's
[1:16:15] the thing. Whatever the thing in your
[1:16:17] life that's difficult, you know, the
[1:16:19] test that you have coming up in school
[1:16:20] or or you know, the boyfriend or
[1:16:22] girlfriend decision you have to make or
[1:16:24] the house that you want to buy a
[1:16:25] financial, whatever it is, whatever that
[1:16:27] thing, it's not worse than death. Now,
[1:16:31] if you can face death, look it right in
[1:16:34] the eye and say, "Death, I got I got
[1:16:36] something for you that I've accepted the
[1:16:39] Lord Jesus Christ into my soul. I've
[1:16:41] accepted THE HOLY SPIRIT. I HAVE THE
[1:16:43] DOWN PAYMENT OF THE RESURRECTION. And if
[1:16:46] YOU CAN LOOK DEATH RIGHT IN THE EYE AND
[1:16:48] FACE HIM, THEN YOU CAN FACE ANY PROBLEM
[1:16:50] that you've got.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Okay. So now he says, he
[1:16:54] says, listen, his days are determined.
[1:16:55] He's got an appointed a boundary. He
[1:16:58] can't go past it. Turn from him that he
[1:16:59] may rest till he shall accomplish as in
[1:17:01] hirling his day. He looks around now.
[1:17:06] Job does. And he sees a flower.
[1:17:10] And he sees the flower as it goes
[1:17:12] through. And October comes and November.
[1:17:14] and he sees the rain. Brother Benham
[1:17:16] says it like this that that the that the
[1:17:19] I think he says the earth has a funeral
[1:17:21] service for that flower as the fall
[1:17:24] rains would come and the it would weep
[1:17:26] and the flower would die and he looks at
[1:17:29] the tree he says there's hope of a tree
[1:17:31] if it be cut down that it will sprout
[1:17:33] again. Verse 7 and that the tender
[1:17:35] branch thereof will not cease. He looks
[1:17:37] now at the flower and he says flowers
[1:17:39] got hope. you know, it the spring rains
[1:17:42] AND THE THE THE HEAVENS CRY WHEN IT
[1:17:44] DIES.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; And then he says the tree, you know, if
[1:17:47] if it's CUT DOWN, IT'S GOT HOPE THAT THE
[1:17:49] TENDER branch thereof will not cease.
[1:17:51] You know, maybe he sees like an aspen
[1:17:52] tree gets cut down and but HE SEES A
[1:17:54] LITTLE CHUTE over there coming BACK UP
[1:17:56] OR OR maybe from the very root he just
[1:17:58] sees something rise and he says there's
[1:18:01] hope of a tree. He says the root where
[1:18:03] thereof would would wax old in the earth
[1:18:05] and the stalk thereof die in the ground.
[1:18:07] And then he says this, "Yet through the
[1:18:09] scent of water it will bud."
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; You ever felt like a spiritual, you
[1:18:15] know, you need you need a little bit of
[1:18:17] uplifting? Maybe you felt that this
[1:18:19] morning like brother Steve did. I I you
[1:18:21] know, it just was spent after yesterday.
[1:18:24] So much going on and nothing left. And I
[1:18:26] came to church and and let me tell you
[1:18:28] what happened. And I got to church and a
[1:18:29] few minutes into the service I [snorts]
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; I smelled a little water, you know, and
[1:18:34] I smelled a scent of water and and
[1:18:36] spiritually it revived my soul and and
[1:18:38] Job's looking at that tree and he goes,
[1:18:40] "Man, if that tree just it's, YOU KNOW,
[1:18:42] WATER THREE MILES away and and that tree
[1:18:45] can hear it running and there's a scent
[1:18:47] of water even though it's dead in the
[1:18:49] earth and the root IS WAXED OLD." HE
[1:18:51] SAID just a scent of water and all of a
[1:18:53] sudden it begins to bud again
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; and it just gives him a he sees it and
[1:18:58] he's looking at nature
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; and he's like look at THIS NATURE. IT
[1:19:03] DIES AND THEN IT RISES AGAIN. LOOK AT
[1:19:05] THE FLOWER AND THE SPRING AND IT'S DEAD
[1:19:07] AND WE HAD A FUNERAL SERVICE and but but
[1:19:09] the spring comes and it comes up again
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; and he's like let's ALL PRAISE THE LORD
[1:19:14] FOR THAT. But he's But he's also in a
[1:19:16] great distress.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's like, "What about what about
[1:19:21] me?"
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Look at this looking at skin worms in
[1:19:26] his body.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "But man dies."
[1:19:30] He wastes away. Gives up the ghost.
[1:19:33] Where's he at? We don't see him rise
[1:19:36] again. I see the tree rise again. I see
[1:19:38] the flower rise again. I see the bush
[1:19:40] rise again. You look outside, you see
[1:19:42] all the cottonwood trees, you know, and
[1:19:43] all the leaves are off them. They're
[1:19:44] dying, BUT WE KNOW THAT IN the spring
[1:19:48] they're going to rise again. You know,
[1:19:50] LIFE WILL COME BEGIN. AND JOB LOOKS AT
[1:19:52] ALL THIS and he goes, "But what about
[1:19:54] me?"
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Look at me and the skin worms and the
[1:19:58] death of my body.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; He's just in a hopeless in a state of
[1:20:02] distress. Brother Bam says, "A flower
[1:20:04] died, it rises again in the spring. If a
[1:20:07] tree blows down, it comes up again
[1:20:09] through the scent of water. He seen all
[1:20:11] botney life living again, but said, "A
[1:20:13] man layth down. He gives up the ghost.
[1:20:15] Where's he at? You know, he was an old
[1:20:17] man. He said, "His sons come over to
[1:20:19] mourn over him, and he perceived it not.
[1:20:22] Oh, that thou would hide me in the
[1:20:23] grave, and keep me in the secret place
[1:20:25] till thy wrath be passed. Appoint me a
[1:20:27] time and set me a time." We went on
[1:20:29] going like that, talking. He was at the
[1:20:31] end of his distress. What would happen?
[1:20:35] The leaves live, come back in the tree,
[1:20:37] the flowers come back and everything
[1:20:39] else come up. But a man lays down, he
[1:20:41] gives up the ghost, he was in distress.
[1:20:43] He didn't know what would happen to him.
[1:20:45] And him at that age, what a thought. As
[1:20:49] you as we get old this morning and I
[1:20:51] look and see some of you over in your
[1:20:52] 70s and and I'm not there. I feel like
[1:20:55] I'm saying, but I'm not yet. But you
[1:20:56] know, I notice that that that I'm
[1:20:59] getting there. And now as you get old,
[1:21:02] you begin to look and you you begin to
[1:21:04] recognize that that man dies. Where what
[1:21:08] happens to him? And if you're not afra,
[1:21:09] if you're not careful, a great distress
[1:21:11] will come upon you. Is there hope for
[1:21:13] that man? He said, he said, "Now you've
[1:21:16] been noticing all these things. I'm
[1:21:18] putting this kindly in a drama child
[1:21:20] form for the little ones." He said, "Now
[1:21:22] you've been holding at that, but but
[1:21:24] remember that flower or that tree never
[1:21:26] sinned against God.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Man sinned against God.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; And so it separated him
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; from God.
[1:21:36] That was the difference.
[1:21:38] that the flower didn't have no sin that
[1:21:40] it had to, you know, respond to. The
[1:21:42] tree, it never sinned against God. It
[1:21:45] was just part of his nature and part of
[1:21:46] him. And so it dies and but you know,
[1:21:49] the the life goes down into that root
[1:21:50] and then spring comes and it lives again
[1:21:52] and and the life would just be buried in
[1:21:55] the very soul of that tree. But that
[1:21:57] tree didn't had no sin. The flower
[1:22:00] didn't have no sin.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Job began to wonder why that man laid
[1:22:04] down and he didn't rise up. He didn't
[1:22:06] see him come up in the spring, but he
[1:22:07] seen the flower come up in the spring.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Well, then when Elahu came to him be to
[1:22:12] speak to him, he said, "Now look, Job,
[1:22:13] you're accusing God wrong. Now look,
[1:22:15] that flower is not sin. It stands right
[1:22:17] in the way that God made it, and it
[1:22:19] reproduces itself right back from death
[1:22:21] to resurrection." Death to resurrection.
[1:22:23] All right? He said, "Now, but man
[1:22:25] sinned, and that separated him from God
[1:22:28] and resurrection.
[1:22:30] The waters, Job said in verse 11, as the
[1:22:33] waters fail from the sea and the flood
[1:22:35] decays and dries up, so man lies down.
[1:22:38] Verse 12, and rises not till the heavens
[1:22:40] be no more. They shall not awake, nor be
[1:22:42] erased out of their sleep. Oh, that thou
[1:22:44] wouldst hide me in the grave, that thou
[1:22:46] would thou wouldst keep me secret until
[1:22:48] thy wrath be passed. That thou
[1:22:50] wouldstoint me a set time and remember
[1:22:52] me. If a man die,
[1:22:56] if sister Vivian or you know laid here
[1:22:58] in the casket yesterday, if sister
[1:23:00] Vivian die, brother Fritz die, will he
[1:23:04] live again?
[1:23:06] Will that happen? What what are we what
[1:23:08] what is our thought process of
[1:23:10] Christianity? What are we here for? What
[1:23:12] do you even walk through the building
[1:23:13] for and begin to worship God if
[1:23:15] eventually we're just going to die and
[1:23:17] lay in the dust and and that's it? I
[1:23:19] heard uh I think it was Richard Dawkins.
[1:23:21] He's some great atheist. if there is
[1:23:22] such a thing. And they were
[1:23:24] interviewing. They said, "What do you
[1:23:25] think happens when you die?" And he's
[1:23:26] like, "Why just decay and that's it?"
[1:23:30] What? You have no hope. Job at least
[1:23:33] looked at the tree and HE SAID, "THE
[1:23:35] TREE'S GOT HOPE AND I'M MADE IN GOD'S
[1:23:38] IMAGE. Is there a WAY THAT THAT I CAN
[1:23:40] HAVE HOPE?" OH, what I would hate to be
[1:23:42] without hope. What a what a disgusting
[1:23:44] thing. What a disgusting trick that the
[1:23:47] devil has given those atheists. And he's
[1:23:49] a he shamed HIM INTO BELIEVING THAT WHEN
[1:23:51] YOU JUST DIE, you just die and that all
[1:23:53] your consciousness is gone and there's
[1:23:55] nothing left. Well, he's going to
[1:23:57] realize if he doesn't get converted that
[1:23:59] HE'S GOING TO DIE, BUT HIS CONSCIOUSNESS
[1:24:01] will be alive and he'll be suffering in
[1:24:03] that place of torment until it's cast
[1:24:06] into the lake of fire and disappears one
[1:24:08] day.
[1:24:10] Oh, what a what a terrible thought.
[1:24:13] Actually, talk about trouble.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; That's trouble. If man die,
[1:24:21] is he going to live again? See, if you
[1:24:24] can face this thought,
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; if you can fa look death right in the
[1:24:27] eye, or then Steve, you know, sometimes
[1:24:30] I've I've had people tell me, "But see,
[1:24:32] I just wish I could die." Fine. Fine.
[1:24:34] Maybe death is is not as bad for you.
[1:24:36] Whatever your anxiety is, your
[1:24:38] depression, the thing that that that
[1:24:40] kind of holds you, you know what it
[1:24:42] holds you from? It holds you from joy. I
[1:24:45] titled this sermon, I don't think I
[1:24:46] pulled it up, the joy that you missed.
[1:24:50] That's actually what it holds you from.
[1:24:51] All that anxiety and the depression and
[1:24:53] the things in your life that you're
[1:24:54] fearful about, you need to turn and look
[1:24:57] him right in the eye.
[1:24:59] Take God with you when you do that turn.
[1:25:02] By the way, don't try to look it by, you
[1:25:04] know, by yourself, BUT TAKE GOD AT YOUR
[1:25:06] SIDE AND SAY, "LORD, HELP ME AS I FACE
[1:25:09] this thing that's that I've been
[1:25:10] confronting all my life WITHOUT YOU."
[1:25:12] TURN AND FACE IT. LOOK IT RIGHT in the
[1:25:14] eye. And the THING THAT YOU GREATLY
[1:25:16] FEAR, face it with God ALMIGHTY CUZ HE'S
[1:25:18] MORE THAN able to help you overcome that
[1:25:20] thing. Eliu, brother Am says, when Eliu
[1:25:23] began to get him straightened out, he be
[1:25:24] to see that there was coming one.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; See, Eliu came to him. He said like
[1:25:30] this. Now Job, I put it so the children
[1:25:33] understand. Now Job, you're watching
[1:25:34] that flower and that tree. That flower
[1:25:37] tree never did sin, but man sin. See the
[1:25:39] tree just and grain and stuff just
[1:25:41] perpetually comes. But man sinned and
[1:25:43] that cut off his relationship between
[1:25:45] him and God. There's no resurrection for
[1:25:47] him now. But oh, I love it. But there's
[1:25:49] a coming one, a just one who will stand
[1:25:52] in the breach. Put a hand on sinful man
[1:25:54] and holy God and bridge the way for
[1:25:58] there will come the resurrection. SO ELI
[1:26:01] COMES TO JOB AND AND HE BRINGS SOMETHING
[1:26:03] TO Job that maybe hadn't thought about,
[1:26:05] but he did think about it because he
[1:26:07] testifies in verse 19 THAT THERE'S
[1:26:09] COMING ONE cuz you need somebody
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN DEATH and
[1:26:15] life. You know, to to BRIDGE THE GAP
[1:26:18] BETWEEN GOD AND MAN in man, not just
[1:26:21] man, but man in the sinful state in
[1:26:23] which he was born. Born in sin and
[1:26:26] shaped in iniquity. Who's going to
[1:26:28] bridge the gap? Who can take us there?
[1:26:31] And Eli who says, "Listen, there is
[1:26:34] coming one."
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; And that's the problem is we don't turn
[1:26:38] and face our fears with God who's able
[1:26:40] to bridge the gap between you and your
[1:26:42] anxiety. And he's ABLE TO OVERCOME YOU
[1:26:45] AND YOUR DEPRESSION, YOU AND YOUR LACK
[1:26:47] OF A JOB, YOU AND YOUR LACK OF ECONOMY.
[1:26:49] GOD [screaming] IS ABLE TO BRIDGE THE
[1:26:51] GAP BETWEEN YOU AND THAT THING, whatever
[1:26:53] it would be.
[1:26:54] You got to you got to just cut close to
[1:26:56] him this morning.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Put him first in your life.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Have pity chapter 19 verse 21 as we move
[1:27:04] forward. There's a few more things here.
[1:27:06] Have pity on me. Have pity on me. And
[1:27:09] he's talking to his friends.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; And by the way, when he makes this
[1:27:14] statement, well, we'll just we'll just
[1:27:15] say it here. Oh ye my friends, for the
[1:27:16] hand of God has touched me.
[1:27:19] Why do you persecute me as God and are
[1:27:21] not satisfied with my flesh?
[1:27:24] Oh, that my words were now written. Oh,
[1:27:27] that they were printed in a book. Oh,
[1:27:28] that they were graven with an iron pen
[1:27:30] and led in the rock forever. For I know
[1:27:34] that my redeemer lives.
[1:27:37] This is the greatest statement right
[1:27:38] here that God that Job got a just a
[1:27:40] vision. Brother Bam said the lightning
[1:27:42] flash and the thunder roared and Job GOT
[1:27:45] A VISION OF SOMEBODY THAT COULD BRIDGE
[1:27:47] THE GAP BETWEEN SINFUL MAN AND A HOLY
[1:27:50] GOD. AND HE SAID THAT'S THE THING CALLED
[1:27:52] THE redeemer and he'll stand at the
[1:27:55] latter day upon the earth. And that
[1:27:57] before that he said, "Hey, THE TREE HAS
[1:27:59] NO HOPE. THE TREE HAS HOPE. THE THE
[1:28:01] FLOWER has hope. But what about man?"
[1:28:03] AND WHEN HE SAW THE REDEEMER BRIDGING
[1:28:05] THE GAP, HE SAID, "PRAISE GOD, I've got
[1:28:06] hope, too."
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Notice,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; he'll stand at the latter day upon the
[1:28:13] earth. And though,
[1:28:16] and I know how King James translated
[1:28:18] this, it's very interesting. after my
[1:28:21] skin worms.
[1:28:24] I've always thought it was skin worms.
[1:28:26] King James says, "My skin worms like
[1:28:28] they're, you know, Brother Bam said
[1:28:29] they're like they're there already."
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; You know, you could try to a nurse back
[1:28:33] there could probably tell you, you know,
[1:28:35] you could try to clean yourself and get
[1:28:37] all this soap and you know, I've seen
[1:28:39] them go into operating rooms. They can't
[1:28:41] help it. They they clean and clean and
[1:28:43] scrape and scrub and wash and make you
[1:28:45] wash and shave. I mean, there's nothing.
[1:28:48] and and yet somehow bacteria sneaks in.
[1:28:51] You know, it's like they're already even
[1:28:54] after doing all that, they give you
[1:28:55] antibiotics cuz you know they can't help
[1:28:58] everything. It's cuz Job is looking
[1:29:00] though. He's sitting there on the ash
[1:29:02] sheep and looking at like actual skin
[1:29:04] worms.
[1:29:06] Though they destroy my body, this body,
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; he's looking, he's like, this body,
[1:29:12] this, right? Though these skin worms
[1:29:13] will destroy this, yet on my flesh.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Now, how could that be? They destroy the
[1:29:21] body, but in the body, in the flesh,
[1:29:24] I'll see God. How could that be?
[1:29:28] Yesterday they decided to not to be
[1:29:31] doctrinally a doctrinal point here but
[1:29:33] they decided to cremate the sister and
[1:29:35] and then they brought the casted forth
[1:29:37] but they had it closed and nobody knew
[1:29:39] and and then they asked me what about
[1:29:41] cremation is that okay and not to be a
[1:29:44] doctrinal point or anything but here's
[1:29:45] the fact of the matter that just within
[1:29:47] a few years of you being buried just
[1:29:50] starts everything just is decaying
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; everything then brother Ram said the
[1:29:53] nose caves in first and you've seen that
[1:29:56] just you know if you're in Egypt and you
[1:29:57] would try to preserve serve it as good
[1:29:59] as you could. I don't think God is going
[1:30:01] to go over if you've had been in dead,
[1:30:02] you know, for like four years and it's
[1:30:04] not super decayed, he's going to go,
[1:30:05] "Well, I can still use a little bit of
[1:30:08] those bones and kind of patch it up."
[1:30:10] Like, I don't think that. But I think
[1:30:12] there's actually like a different body,
[1:30:14] but it's the same body, don't get me
[1:30:15] wrong, BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S THE BODY THAT
[1:30:18] YOU HAVE IN PERFECTION.
[1:30:20] Brother Brandham explains it like this,
[1:30:22] that when you go, you pick up a
[1:30:23] theophony. You pick up a theophony and
[1:30:26] you go to that paradise and you wait and
[1:30:27] you wait and you wait and then he says
[1:30:29] you come back down AND YOU PICK UP that
[1:30:31] earth's body and he calls that a
[1:30:32] glorified body. He says it like this. I
[1:30:35] don't care where all the CELLS ARE AND
[1:30:37] WHERE all the atoms are and where all
[1:30:39] the molecules are. God knows where every
[1:30:41] one of them is and HE'S ABLE TO BRING
[1:30:43] THEM ALL BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND MAKE
[1:30:45] THAT GLORIFIED BODY LIVE AGAIN.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Job says my body, he says, listen worms,
[1:30:51] you destroy ALL YOU WANT. GOD KNOWS
[1:30:53] WHERE THAT MOLECULE is and that molecule
[1:30:55] is and that cell IS AND HE'LL UNITE THEM
[1:30:57] ALL IN A GLORIFIED BODY ONE day and
[1:31:00] it'll just be a perfect like when you
[1:31:03] were you know 20 like when I had more
[1:31:06] hair you know
[1:31:09] thank you brother Rolando and brother
[1:31:12] Rolando had black hair
[1:31:16] you see that that body you know God
[1:31:18] knows where all those cells are he knows
[1:31:20] where every molecule is and he he takes
[1:31:21] takes you into like a theophony. He says
[1:31:23] that's been formed. He said Jesus and
[1:31:26] this might be a little deep, but just
[1:31:27] bear with me. He says Melzdc. He said
[1:31:30] God came down. He just picked up some
[1:31:32] dust and he stepped into he said Melzdc
[1:31:34] was God. Did you know that? But but he
[1:31:36] said he was in his theophony form. And
[1:31:38] he said you bypassed your theophony and
[1:31:41] you came from from God and went right to
[1:31:43] be tempted in the flesh. But then he
[1:31:45] says you're going back TO THE THEOPHONY
[1:31:47] AND YOU'LL BE IN THAT theophony state
[1:31:49] until the resurrection happens. You'll
[1:31:51] come down to earth. You're picking up
[1:31:52] the perfection that God made you in. And
[1:31:55] you'll be in a glorified state.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, destroy my flesh
[1:32:01] in my flesh.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; I will see God. We are waiting for the
[1:32:05] fullness of adoption. This will take
[1:32:06] place when
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; at the first resurrection. That's when
[1:32:09] our bodies will be changed from these
[1:32:11] vile creatures that we are and will have
[1:32:12] a body like his own glorious body.
[1:32:16] For we shall see him as he is and will
[1:32:18] be like him. When he appears, we appear
[1:32:20] and his likeness will have a body like
[1:32:22] his. A glorious, glorified body. And all
[1:32:25] the trials and struggles of life will
[1:32:26] fade off into a little mist and blown
[1:32:29] away to be no more.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Never be no more.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; We meet Jesus in the air before we get
[1:32:36] home. I don't think we ever spoke on
[1:32:39] this before, but just let's see what he
[1:32:40] says here. That's right. This second
[1:32:42] Thessalonians tells us that for we meet
[1:32:44] him in the air. beautiful type of
[1:32:46] Rebecca meeting Isaac in the field in
[1:32:48] the cool of the day. We meet him in the
[1:32:50] air. Second, it's I think it's first
[1:32:52] Thessalonians, but he tells us, "So, for
[1:32:54] we we which are alive and remain shall
[1:32:56] not prevent or hinder those which are
[1:32:57] asleep, for the trumpet of God shall
[1:32:59] sound, the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:33:00] first. We which are alive and remain
[1:33:02] shall be caught up together with them to
[1:33:04] meet the Lord in the air." Brother Bam
[1:33:05] says, "Therefore, the theophony, if you
[1:33:08] have died and entered into that
[1:33:09] theophony, what happens? The theophony
[1:33:11] comes to the earth to pick up the
[1:33:13] redeemed body. And if you're here in the
[1:33:15] air, you take the body to meet the
[1:33:17] theophony. There you are and caught up
[1:33:19] and go meet the Lord in the air. Isn't
[1:33:20] that beautiful? IF YOU'RE HERE, guess
[1:33:22] what? You're going up to meet there. But
[1:33:23] either way, IT'S JUST A GLORIFIED THING
[1:33:25] THAT God is going to and if your loved
[1:33:27] ones HAVE GONE ON, THEY'RE there waiting
[1:33:29] and they're COMING DOWN TO PERFECT AND
[1:33:31] THEY'RE GOING TO KNOCK ON SOME DOORS ONE
[1:33:33] day and they're going to meet us saints
[1:33:35] and it's going to be in the air, but
[1:33:37] it's going to be in a dimension we won't
[1:33:38] even understand. Praise God. Now,
[1:33:42] there's coming one someday who will
[1:33:43] stand in the breach between a sinful
[1:33:46] manise
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; and a holy God and bridge the way. Put a
[1:33:50] hand on a sinful man and the holy God
[1:33:52] bridge the way. Speaking of Christ, the
[1:33:54] prophet saw it. He stood on his feet.
[1:33:56] The lightnings begin to flash. The
[1:33:58] thunders roared. Jobs said, Job said, "I
[1:34:00] know my redeemer liveth. And at the last
[1:34:02] days, he'll stand on the earth. Though
[1:34:04] the stemmed destroy this body, yet in my
[1:34:07] flesh shall I see God whom I shall see
[1:34:12] for myself. He says, "And mine eyes
[1:34:14] shall behold and not another, though my
[1:34:16] reigns be consumed within me."
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; You're going to see him, saints.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Now listen now, just we'll just close
[1:34:24] with this this one quote. I just want
[1:34:26] you to grab on for a second.
[1:34:29] What if you don't face the fear and
[1:34:32] overcome that thing? And you understand
[1:34:34] what I mean by that.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And overcome that thing because if
[1:34:37] you you'd run from it, God's going to
[1:34:39] he's going to make you face the thing
[1:34:42] because he's he wants you to know
[1:34:44] really. He wants you to know that
[1:34:47] greater is he that IS IN YOU THAT CAN
[1:34:50] OVERCOME ANY FEAR YOU HAVE.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; So he doesn't want you to run from it or
[1:34:54] to try to face it all by yourself.
[1:34:56] Because if you do that, you'll be end up
[1:34:58] like Job trying to face it. BUT YOU GOT
[1:35:00] TO FACE IT WITH GOD.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; You must face it. But you must not. If
[1:35:06] you try to face it by yourself, you'll
[1:35:07] fall.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; You'll fail. It'll destroy you. You'll
[1:35:11] blame the message. You'll blame Christ.
[1:35:13] You'll blame your brother. Don't try to
[1:35:15] face it. There there might be some fear
[1:35:17] that you're afraid of with what you
[1:35:18] believe. You just don't understand. And
[1:35:20] so, Satan's tried to put a fear on you.
[1:35:22] Take God with you. pray about that thing
[1:35:24] and face that thing with him. And he'll
[1:35:26] provide you the revelation that you need
[1:35:28] to overcome that fear.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; And if you don't do that, you're missing
[1:35:32] out on something.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; If you're fearful your whole life,
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; that's correct.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; You're missing out on something.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Do you want to miss out? I don't want to
[1:35:42] miss out on something.
[1:35:45] We're going to close with this quote,
[1:35:46] but I I I want it to stick for a second.
[1:35:49] Musicians could come.
[1:35:52] Jesus, he says, "Then be ye therefore
[1:35:55] perfect, even as your heavenly father is
[1:35:57] perfect."
[1:35:58] How can you be?
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; How can you be perfect
[1:36:03] when it's not my perfection?
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Well, that's kind of the key right
[1:36:08] there, isn't it? Do we have that up
[1:36:09] there? I I might have forgot that one.
[1:36:11] It should be the last quote. How can you
[1:36:14] be when it's not my perfection?
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Just trust me on this one. Do I I don't
[1:36:21] have that up there. Sister Pauline, find
[1:36:22] that for me. I want I want them to read
[1:36:24] it along. It's Lamb's Book of Life, 63
[1:36:27] of 56.
[1:36:29] I want you to read this along. Is that
[1:36:30] okay?
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for missing it.
[1:36:37] It's uh I don't know what paragraph it
[1:36:39] starts with. Then be therefore perfect.
[1:36:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:56] Then be you therefore I think it's
[1:37:00] look up perfection.
[1:37:05] Well,
[1:37:08] I might just play it for you. Thank the
[1:37:10] Lord for technology
[1:37:16] there. I think that's it.
[1:37:20] Okay. Yes, that's it.
[1:37:25] I think that's it. Scroll down just a
[1:37:28] second. Scroll down a little bit. Little
[1:37:30] more. A little more.
[1:37:34] Yep. Yep. That's it. All right. Just How
[1:37:36] about we just play that? You can hear
[1:37:37] him say it so I don't have to say it.
[1:37:39] How's that? Start with that 165.
[1:37:42] Got that right, brother Tim?
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Be therefore even Your heavenly father
[1:37:49] IS PERFECT.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU BE WHEN IT'S NOT MY
[1:37:52] PERFECTION? It's not your perfection.
[1:37:55] IT'S HIS PERFECTION OF HIS WORD THAT HE
[1:37:58] CHOSE YOU AND YOU NEVER CHOSE HIM AND HE
[1:38:00] BROUGHT YOU INTO CHRIST AND YOU'RE
[1:38:02] SECURE WITH JESUS CHRIST. AND JUST AS
[1:38:05] PERFECT AS LIFE WAS BEFORE GOD FOR
[1:38:07] YOU'RE not standing with your own,
[1:38:09] you're standing in him with
[1:38:13] a paragraph.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, I love you.
[1:38:21] Oh my. ALL ON THE OTHER SIDE of Eden.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful time it'll be someday.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; When you look back down and say, "Why
[1:38:33] did I fear? Look at the joy I missed."
[1:38:36] Young man, young woman,
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; was that for a second there. Why did I
[1:38:40] fear?
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Look at the joy I missed.
[1:38:45] That's what it does when you're afraid
[1:38:48] death, whatever it might be in your
[1:38:49] life. You anxious about some future
[1:38:52] decision you're going to make or some
[1:38:54] past failure that you you think it was a
[1:38:56] failure. It might not be. God might have
[1:38:58] just been using it for everything. So,
[1:39:00] you get anxious about that. You be
[1:39:01] fearful about that or worried or
[1:39:03] depressed, whatever it might be. Or in
[1:39:04] the future, you got something. Play that
[1:39:06] again. Why did I fear? Look at the joy I
[1:39:10] missed.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; I don't want to miss it. Why did I fear
[1:39:14] her? Look at the joy I miss.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Don't
[1:39:19] keep playing. Just Just one more
[1:39:21] paragraph.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Young man, young woman this morning. Are
[1:39:24] you old man or woman who's never been a
[1:39:26] Christian? God's continually knocked at
[1:39:29] your heart. [clears throat] Oh yes. You
[1:39:31] might come in at the end of the road,
[1:39:33] but you'll have no joy. There'll be no
[1:39:36] STAR AROUND YOU TO SHINE. I don't want
[1:39:38] to stand LIKE THAT. I WANT TO HEAR HIM
[1:39:40] SAY, "IT WAS WELL DONE, my good and
[1:39:43] faithful." I want to show him my
[1:39:46] appreciation.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; My poor little grayheaded wife. HOW I'D
[1:39:50] LOVE TO DO SOMETHING for her, but I know
[1:39:52] she likes
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; because I love her and I know she loves
[1:39:56] me. And if I do that for my wife and the
[1:40:00] human love, what ought I have to do to
[1:40:02] know that God by grace before the
[1:40:05] foundation world seen me a poor little
[1:40:07] sinner staggered and was going TO HELL
[1:40:09] AND COULDN'T HAVE.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; And he forame me and put my name in the
[1:40:13] lamb's book of life the foundation
[1:40:15] world. OH, I LOVE HIM. THERE'S NO WAY I
[1:40:18] WILL EVER TELL HIM. AMEN.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; NO WONDER THE BIBLE SAID eyes not seen
[1:40:22] ears not heard. NEITHER HAS ENTERED INTO
[1:40:23] THE HEARTS OF MAN. Poor man.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; How glorious God is.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to trust him?
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; If you're weary and crossing out,
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; SHAME ON YOU CHRISTIANS THAT call
[1:40:35] yourselves Christians.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; And glory.
[1:40:39] Well, I don't know. If I go to church,
[1:40:41] say, "Oh, you're a poor excuse.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, lift up your head.
[1:40:47] STRAIGHTEN UP YOUR CHEST. [screaming]
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; OH, USE FAITH."
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FAITH IS A BOSS.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Faith has HAIRS ON ITS CHEST. IT'S GOT
[1:41:00] BIG [screaming] MUSCLES.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; WHEN SPEAK
[1:41:04] FROM ONE side the other
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; the devil said, "Now you just can't make
[1:41:08] it. You can't do this. YOU'RE ASHAMED TO
[1:41:09] TESTIFY." FAITH RAISED UP SAY,
[1:41:14] "AMEN."
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; SURE.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Faith takes the initiative.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; That's what we need today. Pray for the
[1:41:22] children IN THE LAND. STRAIGHTEN UP YOUR
[1:41:24] HEAD.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD. PRAISE THE LORD. Brother
[1:41:26] Isaac, let's sing that. Stand with us
[1:41:27] this morning. I like what he said.
[1:41:30] Straighten up.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Don't I don't want to get up there and
[1:41:35] say, "Look at all the joy I missed."
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Man, you can have joy this morning. Even
[1:41:40] if you got trials that are facing you
[1:41:42] and this and that, why don't you face
[1:41:44] them? And
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be missing out on any
[1:41:47] joy. Personally, I've already missed out
[1:41:48] enough joy in life. I'd like to have go
[1:41:50] forward with a a lot of joy. Praise the
[1:41:52] Lord. Help us out, brother Isaac.

[1:42:27] done for [music] me. I get happy when I

[1:43:13] you set [music] me free.

[1:44:20] Take his joy with you.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Never forget what he's done for me.
[1:44:26] Praise him. Appreciated that prayer,
[1:44:28] brother Brandon this morning. He's
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; beautiful.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, just feel the presence of the Lord
[1:44:35] moving. Just worship him for moment,
[1:44:38] brother Isaac. Whatever you have there,

[1:49:25] Brother Kurt, will you dismiss us a word
[1:49:27] of prayer? Brother Kurt.

[1:49:32] afternoon, your invit's going to be
[1:49:35] speaking at
[1:49:37] missionary report

[1:49:50] back.
[1:50:21] this morning. God, [music] we came here
[1:50:23] because we wanted to be with you.
[1:50:30] Your presence
[1:50:34] made a difference
[1:50:36] today.
[1:50:41] You said that in your presence was
[1:50:43] fullness of joy and at your right hand
[1:50:46] was pleasures forever more. We were so
[1:50:50] glad to be here with you.
[1:50:53] That was our whole purpose this morning
[1:50:56] was to have you come and talk to our
[1:50:59] hearts.
[1:51:02] The inspiration of your presence here
[1:51:04] this morning was obvious.
[1:51:08] We felt that breath of [music] life move
[1:51:10] over this congregation. We felt that
[1:51:13] breath of life
[1:51:16] move on our souls.
[1:51:18] And you want us to take
[1:51:21] the instructions of [music] the word
[1:51:22] that we heard this morning
[1:51:26] and you want us to go out [music] and
[1:51:28] create worlds [snorts]
[1:51:32] with the words
[1:51:34] that we heard. We were born for that,
[1:51:37] God.
[1:51:38] to go out and create worlds, [music]
[1:51:41] Lord, with our thoughts,
[1:51:44] whether our tongues,
[1:51:47] more important with our actions.
[1:51:51] May that [music] inspiration that was
[1:51:53] here this morning, which was the Holy
[1:51:55] Ghost,
[1:51:58] may we not leave it in this building.
[1:52:03] write
[1:52:05] the inspiration that we heard on the
[1:52:07] tables of our heart and may we go
[1:52:13] out
[1:52:15] into this world and may we be that
[1:52:17] bridge.
[1:52:19] May we represent that bridge
[1:52:23] to someone out there [music] for that is
[1:52:25] why we were born
[1:52:29] was to continue your work.
[1:52:32] May we fulfill [music]
[1:52:37] that purpose in our life.
[1:52:41] And may it start, Lord, with [music]
[1:52:43] prayer. May it start with reading the
[1:52:45] Bible. But more important, may it start
[1:52:48] with us rededicating ourselves to you
[1:52:51] first and then reading the Bible.
[1:52:56] Reconsecrating ourselves and then
[1:52:58] praying. for truly our soul is the
[1:53:01] [music] prize.
[1:53:03] And then may we go out and finish
[1:53:07] [music] what you have purposed our lives
[1:53:09] for. [snorts] We will give you all the
[1:53:11] glory.
[1:53:13] We will give you all the honor. Your
[1:53:15] presence this morning has made the
[1:53:18] difference. [music] Breathe on us, God,
[1:53:21] the breath of life.
[1:53:25] shower upon us your [music] great
[1:53:27] spirit.
[1:53:29] In fact, we would ask big and ask for a
[1:53:32] double portion of all these things.
[1:53:36] We love you and oh, how we worship you
[1:53:40] and praise you in the name of Jesus
[1:53:43] Christ the Lord. Amen.
[1:53:50] And Lord be with you if uh Lord willing.
[1:53:53] We'll see you back at 3:30. Whatever you
[1:53:54] have on your heart with Isaac,
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; God be with you as you go. God bless
[1:54:01] you.
