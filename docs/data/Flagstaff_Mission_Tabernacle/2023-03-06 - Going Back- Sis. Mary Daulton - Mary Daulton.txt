========================================
[Music] whatever happened to death to us apart [Music] parents faces tell of worried Minds while children search and can't seem to find it's time we took another back to living by the holy book no compromise without getting slacked oh we'll go forward if we'll just go back we'll know the tree by the fruit that we see serving God has [Music] it's coming down oh there's no time for playing around we're going back to lost we're going back to stand our ground we've got to go back to living true we're going back to our absolute back to where the church Stands Strong back to where there's a ride oh there is [Music] it's my day and night we're going back to true or false we're going back to calvary's cross we've got to go back [Music] to where the church [Music] you see the difference [Music] we're going back to calvary's cross we're going back to true or fall [Music] we're going back
