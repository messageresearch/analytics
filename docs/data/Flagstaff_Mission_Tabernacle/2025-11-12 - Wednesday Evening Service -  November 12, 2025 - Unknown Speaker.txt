========================================

for the Lord Jesus. Um, I was reading in my Bible this [music] morning. Peter had uh made up his mind he was just going to go fishing. He was he was done. You know, he had [music] thrown in the towel, you know, made some mistakes, walling in his grief a [music] little bit. I'll just go fishing. I'm sure we've all been there. I'll just go back to what I was doing. [music] And then Jesus showed up and said, "Peter, do you love me?" He said, "Yeah, I love you, [music] Lord." No. G No, Peter, do you love me? Yeah, I love you, Lord. No, Peter, do you love me? Yeah, I love you, Jesus. I love you. So, he had to That wasn't for Jesus. That was for Peter. Because Peter had to say in his mind, &gt;&gt; "Yeah, I love you. I've been with you this time and you've taken care of me." [music] So, I just wanted to encourage you with that this evening that if you are feeling like you just want to go back to what you were doing this evening, just call on the Lord. He'll come back and remind you that he loves you. So, [music] um, we have some requests, uh, this morning. Where man, come on. It's it's evening. Um, and we'll go to those. And I also have a note here, uh, from Brother Steve. It says that uh, they arrived in Peru safely and have already begun ministering. So, please remember [music] them uh, in prayer. And, you know, with the flight situation and the airports [music] being closed, that's no small thing that they got there safely. it sounds like with no delays. Look, the Lord's [music] in their trip and is just with them and and is able to minister to lost souls while they're down there. [music] So, uh in the note here, it says that uh brothers and sisters, thank you so much for the pastor [music] appreciation book. It was filled with such lovely cards, kind words. What an absolutely beautiful [music] gift that we will treasure. Thank you. God bless you all. Love Brother Steve and sister Danette. So, I know that uh they appreciated everyone's words of kindness and love to to him and you know uh again we we appreciate him and his family's work and uh effort that they put forward to serve all of us. So, um [music] just a couple requests. We'll read them and then we'll take them before the Lord. Um I'm just going to read [music] this directly. It's it's from brother Glenn. It says, "The results were not quite what we wanted to hear today. God is in [music] control. We believe and know that God has a plan. We have gone back to a treatment that we know has worked in [music] the past. Praying that neuropathy is not a side effect. No side effects, just results. Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And then I know uh sister Cindy, brother Tom had an urgent request that went out to the body. Uh we ask that they be with uh be with them as well. And if you have a need uh this evening, he's here. He loves you. Just say it to him. Just tell him &gt;&gt; cuz that's for you that you love him. He'll take care of you. Let's bow our heads. Dear heavenly father, Lord, we take these requests [music] before you this evening. They're they're serious requests, heavenly father. And Lord, brother Glenn and and Sister Cindy, they're in need of you, Heavenly Father. Lord, they're in need of something spectacular. Heavenly Father, Lord, comes to my mind [music] a quote of Brother Bram talking about faith doesn't take no for an answer. It's got a big old burly [music] chest and it just stands there. Everything else is in quiet in front of that faith, Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; So, Lord, we call that faith, the word of God, before the people this evening, heavenly father, that all doubts would be silenced, all negativity would be silenced. See, because that thing can't stand in front of that faith. The two can't mix. Faith and doubt, the two cannot mix. It's either one or the other. And Lord, this evening, we have by the power of your word to claim faith in our healing, Lord. Faith [music] in the healing for brother Glenn and uh Sister Cindy, Lord, that they they've battled this too long. [snorts] They've battled it too hard. And Lord, you specialize in [music] hard situation. You specialize in taking care of hard-fought battles, &gt;&gt; Lord. And when we get to the end, Lord, the word says your sovereign grace is will step in and take over from there, Lord. So, we call on your sovereign grace in these situations this evening, heavenly father Lord, that you would just go and meet this request. And to each one that had raised their hands, Lord, go and meet them where they're at, heavenly father Lord, remind them that they love you and that you love them. Heavenly Father, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. See each one of them. Amen. Amen. Amen. A little chorus, Brother Ryan. Um, if we could. I get so thrilled with Jesus. I get so thrilled with Jesus. Amen. You know, as I listened to how the spirit moves through man, so it wasn't Donald [music] speaking and I thought, Lord, what am I going to hear? And and uh I've heard what I just been listening to. And the reality, brother, and if I could just encourage along with that, brother Brennham says that most of the time, most people think that God did all these great things even to dying on the cross and then just would stand back and look at with his arms folded and [music] just just see how we're going to react. He said that is not the case. He says he's in aminc amongst it. He moves with you. Every day is he has a decision through it. So just with confidence we can go forward and knowing that everything is all okay. I get so thrilled with Jesus. I get so thrilled [music] thrilled with Jesus every moment of the day. I get so thrilled with Jesus. [singing] He's the truth, the life, the way. I get so thrilled with Jesus. He satisfies my longing [music and singing] soul. I get so thrilled with Jesus. He's the one that made me [singing] whole. I get so thrilled with Jesus [singing] every moment of the day. I get so thrilled with [music and singing] Jesus. He's the truth, the life, the way. I get so thrilled with Jesus. He satisfies [music] my longing soul. I get so thrilled with my Jesus. He's the one that made me whole. I get so thrilled with Jesus every [singing and music] moment of the day. I get so thrilled with Jesus. He's the [singing and music] truth, the life, the way. I get so thrilled with Jesus. He satisfies my longing soul. I get so thrilled with Jesus. [music and singing] He's the one that makes me whole. Yes, it's the truth. Amen. Amen. My God is real. Amen. I guess that's if you can't tell, that's sort of where it's just been a little bit more revelation. He's real in all things that we go through. My God is real. It's good to have each one of you here. Amen. Amen. My God is real. Amen. Does somebody have a testimony before we sing this song that they that goes along with here? My God is real. Anybody have a testimony that Liberty &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And he was just sitting in the parking lot yelling at the manager. [music] &gt;&gt; I had my great aunt and great uncle with me. So mom was like, "Just walk across the street. Stay away from that guy." &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; He grabs a water gun and starts shooting us with water. And I just want to say I'm thankful that it wasn't. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And there again, that's just proof that he's in every aspect of every life. He hasn't left you. He just knows exactly what it was. And he could have put, for all we know, he could have just changed the thought to a water gun. That's exactly the truth. Amen. My God is real. Thank you. [music] Our God is real. He's real [music and singing] in my soul. My God is real. [music and singing] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat.

And you know the reason he won't it won't because it's not because of anything about you. It's because his word said and he can't fail his word. So he won't. So he just sort of set rest it all on him. Rest it all on him. Amen. Amen. Amen. The song is brother Diggs. We invite him out. Um Amazing Grace. I'm sorry. Brother Benuit. I thank you, brother.

Praise [singing] God. Praise God. [music] Oh, praise God. Praise God. [singing] [music] Could we bow our heads just a moment for a word of prayer while they continue to play? Maybe there'd be a special need tonight. You'd like to make known by way of uplifted hand. Oh, God sees and knows every heart and every need. Heavenly Father, we're just so grateful to be here together. Lord, though we're from different parts of the country, but Lord, we know that you are the same God and you're the same God here in Flagstaff, Arizona. Lord, as you've shown yourself present many times before, [music] I pray you do that again tonight. Speak through lips of clay. Lord, I pray that you just move in a mighty way. Lord, may your word be clear in our hearts and our minds. May your may your presence be felt, Lord. May we know you in the power of your resurrection, Lord. When we leave this place, may we say, "Didn't our hearts burn within us as you talk to us along the way? pray you'd move me out of the way, Lord, and man, not say anything that would be unpleasing to you, Lord. I pray that you'd bless these people, meet these needs, Lord. I don't know what they are, but you're able to meet every need represented by way of uplifted hand. I pray that you'd do it tonight, and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight with all the singing. We'll have Psalms chapter 63:es 1 and 2. Psalm 63, verses 1 and 2. It's good to be here tonight. Uh bring greetings from our church in Hardy, Arkansas. I know you don't know where that is. Maybe some of the old-timers would know. Uh there's a good group of believers there. And I'm a pastor there in Hardy. And Sister Britney sitting back here is my wife. She's with me, able to be with me on this trip. We're here resting. So this is what a preacher does I guess when but brother Steve had asked me to come if I was here in the area and so I didn't I wanted to honor him by coming and appreciate the honor of brother Steve asking us to come. I've heard of this church uh for for many many years never been here that I can remember. I think my parents were here when I was about three years old for a meeting or something but that was a long time ago. So, but we sure appreciate you all and and your pastor and your stand for the message of the hour and uh we just you I I don't want to disappoint you. I'm not brother Diggs. So, um and I'm not as good a preacher as brother Diggs, but uh we sure appreciate him. I'm sure you'll enjoy him when he comes. And uh I was hoping I'm glad I got to preach before him and not after him. So, you'll be looking forward to that. Amen. Psalms chapter 63 and verse one. Oh God, thou art my God. How many could say amen to that tonight? &gt;&gt; Early will I seek thee. My soul thirsteth for thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My flesh longeth for thee. Notice in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So as I have seen thee in the sanctuary. I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated tonight. I can remember years ago uh walking with my grandfather in a dusty field. He was a farmer and he'd kick a clot of dirt and dust would raise up. We were raised in the Midwest in Missouri. And the dust would come up and and he'd been working and he'd been trying to produce a crop. He'd done everything that he could to fertilize the ground and all of those things, but it was not irrigated ground. And so he would say something like this. He said, "All we need is a good rain." &gt;&gt; All we need is a good rain. &gt;&gt; So what I want to title this tonight, I I believe we do need a good rain. &gt;&gt; We We need If we're going through a dry and a thirsty land, we need the rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People underestimate the transformative power of water. Water can change things. It can change a dry place to a a well-watered place, an unproductive place to a productive place. And I believe the same is true of spiritual water. I know there's people that don't think we need the spirit of God. And I believe that we do. I believe we have the word. I I don't believe we need another prophet to come or another uh message to come. I I think the message of the hour is sufficient for what we have need of. I believe we have the word of God and what we need is a little bit of rain on the word of God to make it grow to make it produce in our lives to make it to make it actually do something for us. &gt;&gt; I believe the word is powerful and yet we need the rain to transform our lives and prod provide the atmosphere for the word to be able to grow in. I I I've often wondered this, maybe I think oddly, and you're going to think that this is the most simple thing that you've ever heard, but how did deserts get dry? Do &gt;&gt; you ever think about that? How did deserts get dry? A desert is, in case you didn't know what a desert is, a desert is a region of land that receives very little precipitation, typically less than 10 in per year. And and and it's characterized by idity, extreme temperatures, and sparse vegetation. I will say this, the deserts in Arizona are much much prettier than the deserts in the Middle East. If you've been to uh if you've been to uh Egypt or some place like that, it or Arabia, it's a uh it's a just a horrible expanse of dirt and sand and there's no reason anybody should ever live there or or go there for any reason. I've been there. There's just no there's no good there's no pleasant thing about it at all. And and yet even the deserts here, they're dry. And they weren't always dry. Science says that that the desert near Tucson here in Arizona has only been in its current condition for about 4,500 years. Uh, you know, God never made a desert. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; He never created a desert, at least not in the kind we have now, right? He didn't make it to be that way. Cuz we know in Genesis chapter 2, and we're just going to kind of look at this for a minute, so you forgive I know it's Wednesday night, but we're just going to proceed as if uh as if we had till 8:30. So, we'll just keep preaching and uh but until it's time to go home. So, Genesis 2 and verse4, these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day the Lord God made the earth in the heavens, every plant of the field and every herb of the field before it grew. For the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground, but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground. So, we know that it was not meant to be for one area to not have water. We don't know exactly how much water it had, but every part of the earth that God made WAS PRODUCTIVE. AND GOD MADE US to be productive. He He made us to be a a place where something would grow, where the fruits of the spirit could grow, where the things of God could become reality in our lives, where we could begin to help somebody else. HE DIDN'T MAKE US to be dead. He didn't make us to be dry. He made us to be alive. How many believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; So, if he made us to be alive, then we need the rain to make us live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "Why can't we be like they were back then and just have the water water the whole face of the ground?" because we live in in earth bodies &gt;&gt; and that won't change until we get a body change. And I'm grateful that that's coming, church. We're we're going to be completely saved one day, if we could put it like that, where our souls ARE SAVED NOW, BUT OUR BODIES ARE GOING TO CHANGE AND MORTALITY IS GOING TO BE SWALLOWED UP BY IMMORTALITY. I'M LOOKING FORWARD to that time. &gt;&gt; I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. BUT WHILE WE'RE HERE, WHILE WE'RE IN BODIES OF FLESH, WHILE WE HAVE NEEDS, WHILE WE GET [screaming] SICK, WHILE WE ARE ARE HUMAN BEINGS, WE NEED THE WATER. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR FOR STEPPING BACK AND JUST SAYING, "WELL, I'LL JUST WAIT OUT UNTIL THE COMING OF THE LORD. I WON'T BE ON FIRE FOR GOD. I DON'T NEED THE RAIN. I DON'T NEED I don't need the spirit of God." THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THAT. LET'S PRESS ON AND OCCUPY TILL THE COMING OF THE LORD. LET'S BE EVERYTHING GOD MEANT US TO BE. IF FLAGSTAFF TABERNACLE WAS WAS MEANT BY GOD TO BE HERE, AND I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS, OR IT WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD ALL THESE YEARS, THEN LET'S MAKE IT A PLACE WHERE THE WATER IS, WHERE THERE'S AN ENVIRONMENT [screaming] THAT GOD CAN MOVE IN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, MY JOB TONIGHT IS TO TO BE HERE TO HELP CHANGE THAT ENVIRONMENT. AND WE WE [screaming] ALL GET DRY during the week. WE GET DUSTY. BUT JUST FOR A MINUTE, let's turn our eyes toward heaven. SAY, "LORD, ALL WE NEED IS A LITTLE RAIN AND WE CAN MAKE IT TILL SUNDAY. ALL WE NEED IS A LITTLE RAIN AND WE CAN FACE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE NEED TO FACE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It didn't rain till Noah's time. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 7:11, it tells us that in the 600th year of Noah's life, it's never too late for a little rain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was 600 years old. The same day where all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and the rain finally stopped and the water receded and suddenly some land got more rain than others and slowly the grass and the trees begin to disappear. The plants begin to change. &gt;&gt; Deserts begin to form. You you know a flower in the desert, a flower in a place that began to get less and less rain would gradually change itself. &gt;&gt; And the purpose of that the flower has is to protect itself &gt;&gt; and to to contain the water that it has because through the process of evaporation, it would actually uh it needs its leaves. it needs its uh water that what little water that it gets and so it its leaves begin to roll up and become a thorn. They tell us that modern cactus comes from a a member of the rose family, a flower called pescia, which has no thorns or stickers at all. It's actually a rose without any thorns. And we know that thorns were a part of Adam's curse. In Genesis 3 uh 18, it says, "Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field." And so it was part of the curse that thorns would come. And and we see that as deserts begin to form and thorns begin to come. And the Brandham uh uses that as a metaphor for individuals becoming dry and churches becoming dry and people having less water than what they should have. And I'm not here to present to you today that we need Pentecostalism. We don't need that. We we don't necessarily even need somebody running around the church, though that would be nice if somebody wants to. And we don't necessarily need somebody uh running around speaking in tongues and JUMPING THE PEWS. BUT WE DO NEED THE SPIRIT OF GOD. WE DO NEED THE PRESENCE OF GOD IN our lives. &gt;&gt; We need his leadership. WE NEED HIS GUIDANCE. WE NEED HIM TO OPEN THE WORD TO US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Be able to see something in the word of God. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE NEED SOMETHING that'll make us go to church. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT'LL MAKE US SERVE THE LORD WITH OUR whole heart. SOMETHING THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GRAB A HOLD OF AND SAY, "I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MY PARENTS THAT THEY THEY WANT TO SERVE THE LORD, AND I WANT TO SERVE THAT SAME GOD." &gt;&gt; Something will make us repent when we need to repent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We don't need a charismatic move. We need a Bible move. &gt;&gt; We need the presence of God. AND WE CAN HAVE IT because we are the bride of JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO BE WITH US. HE WANTS to be AROUND US. HE WANTS TO DISPLAY HIMSELF TO US. &gt;&gt; YES, he does. &gt;&gt; All we have to do is ask him. &gt;&gt; Moses said, "If your present presence doesn't go, don't send me." I think we all ought to be like that. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you face or what kind of jobs that you have. In fact, I know very little about any of you. But I'll say this. I found the human beings all over the world are about the same. We we we face struggles at work. We face struggles in our families and our homes. We get sick. We we have problems with finances. We have we have problems. We fight our own minds and our own sometimes we we get so worried about things and and WE GET STRESSED OUT AND WE GET ANXIETY AND THAT THAT'S EVERYWHERE. All we need is a little bit of rain tonight to kind of fix that for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, BUT I DON'T LIKE TO BE DRY. I DON'T LIKE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE I FEEL BACKSLID ALL THE TIME. I KNOW I'M A SON OF GOD. I KNOW I'M A CHILD OF GOD. I KNOW I'M GOING TO MAKE IT. I KNOW I'M PREDESTINED. HOW MANY BELIEVE YOU ARE TONIGHT? I KNOW I'M A CHILD OF GOD, BUT I NEED A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN. &gt;&gt; I NEED SOMETHING TO THAT THAT'LL MAKE ME THAT'LL [screaming] CAUSE ME TO SEEK AFTER GOD AND search for God. AND THE MORE YOU get of him, the more the the more water that you get, the more thirsty you become. But only for him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I travel around the world a lot. One of the most stickerest, that's the word he uses, stickerest, nastiest places to try to lay down is in the desert. Everything there has got a sticker on it." Now, I realize Flagstaff isn't the desert. So, y'all don't I know where I'm at tonight, but I just felt this on my heart. &gt;&gt; I don't believe this church is a desert, but we don't ever become that way, do we? Amen. &gt;&gt; Preach this to my church at home. And I just believe that we we want to be we want to have the presence of God in our midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "Every kind of little old weed is a cactus in the desert. You can't lay down nowhere sticking you. The reason of it is they ain't got no water." &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, that's pretty simple. How did the desert get dry?" Well, they don't got no water. &gt;&gt; Said, "Water makes it soft." Where there's lots of water. You don't have any thorns and thistles where there's lots of water. I tell you, brother, you take an old church that's dry in its bone and no Holy GHOST IN IT, NO SALVATION, NO DIVINE HEALING, NO POWER OF GOD, NO SHOUTING, NO JOY. He said, "It's always this. Oh, she done this and he done this and he done this." He said, "It's a sticker." He said, "What you need IS A GOOD OLDFASHIONED OUTPOURING GUSHER OF THE HOLY GHOST." HALLELUJAH. HE SAID, "SOFTEN UP A little bit. &gt;&gt; Soften up a little bit." I think we could all use a little bit of softening, couldn't we? &gt;&gt; I told the church, and we're a church that's been through a lot. We've had a a heart in the church is doing good and growing and and the Lord has blessed us over the last few years and people see that sometimes they don't realize what you've been through in the past and we we've been through some things and we've seen some dry times and uh but but I I I told the church, you know, YOU GET TO A PLACE WHERE YOU REALIZE, DO YOU WANT A CHURCH OR DO you want a fight? &gt;&gt; Cuz you can't have both. DO YOU WANT A CHURCH OR DO YOU WANT A FUSS CUZ YOU can't have both? DO YOU WANT A PLACE FOR YOUR CHILDREN TO GO AND AND CAN STILL RECEIVE THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST AND A PLACE THAT STILL PREACHES THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR? DO YOU WANT THAT OR DO YOU WANT THE WORLD? &gt;&gt; You can't have both. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I want what God has for me. I don't want to be a sticker. I want to be somebody that can BE USED AND I DON'T CARE. LET OTHER PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY want to do. I think each ONE OF US AS INDIVIDUALS OUGHT TO PLACE THAT IN OUR HEARTS TONIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO BE A STICKER. I WANT TO BE A A ROSE. I WANT TO BE SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP SOMEBODY. I WANT TO BE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN REST NEAR ME AND I WON'T POKE THEM AND AND PROD THEM AND hurt them. &gt;&gt; People hurt people because they don't have enough water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you need, he said, is a good oldfashioned outpouring gusher of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And soften up a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said a dry climate just develops stickers. Everything that's on it got that's got a sticker. He said, "You change and take that same variety of weed, put it up in a country where there's a lot of rain and swamp. It's just as soft as it can be." &gt;&gt; Water makes the difference. &gt;&gt; He said, "You take a church that's just so dry that they never have prayer meetings. They become stickers. They're just finding fault and sticking to one." I'm not preaching at you, church. I know this a little bit hard for to hear from a new preacher, but we just we just believe the word of God, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "They're just finding fault sticking one another. What we need is a good rain." He said every time he gets you, you get against it, it'll stick you. Everything on the desert, he said every little old bush is harmful because it doesn't have enough water to take care of it. Stickers come out for a defense, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO SO A PERSON GETS HURT, &gt;&gt; by a sticker, &gt;&gt; and so they come, THEY BEGIN TO ROLL UP THEMSELVES AND DRAW UP THEMSELVES. WELL, I'LL JUST &gt;&gt; I'LL JUST QUIT going to church. OR MAYBE THEY GO, BUT THEY DON'T FELLOWSHIP. MAYBE THEY GO, BUT THEY won't put their all into it. They won't get into the service. They've drawn up into a sticker. It comes out for a defense. &gt;&gt; He said, "You come back up here up in Oregon or somewhere where it rains all the time and every one of them same kind of bushes hasn't got a sticker on them." See, the water keeps them soft. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what's the matter with the church. When you get all dried up and shackled up and everything, YOU GET SO COLD AND FORMAL AND INDIFFERENT, YOU DON'T GET ANY SPIRITUAL BLESSING. THEN YOUR HEART GETS ALL FILLED UP AND FULL OF INDIGNATION AND WRATH. EVERYBODY SAYS, "OH, I'll get even with him. I'll get even with her. I'll quit the church. Just a bunch of stickers living in a desert." That's right. What you need IS SOME GOOD OLDFASHIONED HOLY SPIRIT WATER RAIN DOWN UPON YOU. SOFTEN UP THAT OLD HARD HEART. SAY, "GOD, all we need is a little bit of rain tonight." &gt;&gt; Glory. Praise the Lord. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham talks about this a lot. I don't read all of it, but he said everything in the desert has a sticker on it. He said the sticker is a leaf rolled up. What made it a sticker? Because it had no water for the lack of water. It becomes a sticker. That thus it is with the church today that when the church gets away from the fountain of life, when it gets away from the joys of salvation, when it gets away from the Lord God, then that person becomes a sticker. ALWAYS FINDING FAULT STICKING. No sooner you come up, I'm Presbyterian. I'm Methodist. I'm so and so. Don't talk to me about that stuff. Listen, church, we're almost as bad. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, I go to this church or that one or the other. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I believe the age of man has passed. There'll be a stone cut out of the mountain at the end time without hands. I I think that's the hour that we're living in. I think this is the hour for the bride to say, "I'm a part of the bride of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't care what church you go to. I I want to be a help to you. If you're another member OF THE BRIDE, LET ME BE A HELP. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. WE TELL our preachers, our younger preachers, cuz I'm 40 years old, but I'm the elder preacher in our church and the pastor. And I tell our younger preachers, I said, you know, we don't go somewhere to hurt them. We go somewhere to help them. &gt;&gt; We go somewhere to edify them. So, if you go out to preach somewhere, we got some good young preachers in the church. I I want them to help somebody. I don't want them to be a hurt. &gt;&gt; I don't want them to be a sticker or try to draw people away from one CHURCH TO ANOTHER. GOD, HELP US FROM DOING THAT. LET LET'S SEE GOD MOVING IN EVERY CHURCH, EVERY PLACE WHERE WE GO. LET'S BRING A LITTLE BIT OF REVIVAL IF WE CAN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Don't mean to yell at you tonight. &gt;&gt; I know it's a Wednesday night, but [snorts] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said, "You take the same plant, a cactus, and put it into a land for a few generations where there's plenty of water." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that sticker will unfold. &gt;&gt; So a sticker doesn't have to stay a sticker. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can unfold. &gt;&gt; Say, "God, unfold my life." &gt;&gt; That's wonderful. &gt;&gt; See, preachers don't get that way. I beg to differ. &gt;&gt; I'm not old, but I've been preaching a long time. And I know I know how easy it is to get into desert and get in a place where you can't be a help to nobody. And you got to get to a place where in the presence of God where you can unfold. and come out of soft leaf bearing fruit. In the 17th chapter of Exodus, we won't read it to save time, but Moses brings the children of Israel to Mount Horeb. Horeb literally means a dry place or a desert. Brother Brandham calls it a desert bypass. [snorts] They took a desert bypass. And he he said, "WHEN WE GET OUT OF FELLOWSHIP with one another in the church and out of fellowship with the Holy Spirit, it brings us to a dry place." Did we hear that tonight? WHEN WE GET OUT OF FELLOWSHIP WITH ONE ANOTHER AND OUT OF FELLOWSHIP WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT, IT BRINGS us to a dry place. A desert, NOTHING ALIVE. EVERYTHING GOT stickers on it. &gt;&gt; See a desert, a little piece of cactus with that sticker on it. Do you know what that is? THAT'S A PRECIOUS LITTLE tender leaf that hasn't had no water. &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST WOUND ITSELF UP SO TIGHT till it's a sticker. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus. And a lot OF TIMES WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CUT OFF THE STICKER OR or or rebuke the sticker. And really what it needs is a little bit of water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Real good. &gt;&gt; He said when YOU SEE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT, MAYBE IT'S A PRECIOUS SOUL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN WATERED RIGHT, WOULD HAVE BEEN A TENDER little leaf OR SOMETHING. BUT INSTEAD OF THAT, IT'S WOUND ITSELF UP TILL IT'S A STICKER just punching at everything. Finding fault. Only thing it needs is just water. That's all. Oh Lord, that's what WE NEED TONIGHT. JUST WATER. THAT'S ALL. IT JUST NEEDS A REVIVAL, A BREAKING UP, a refreshing from the Lord. IT'LL UNFOLD its little self IF YOU'LL JUST PUT it to the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've seen we've got plants at home and they can BE JUST AS DRY. WILL GO ON A TRIP JUST AS DRY. And as SOON AS YOU PUT WATER BACK ON THEM, THEY BEGIN TO UNFOLD AND THEY BEGIN TO be what the the beauty THAT IS ALREADY IN THEM BEGINS TO COME OUT. WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE? THE WATER MADE THE DIFFERENCE. &gt;&gt; But listen to this. You know, WE PUT OURSELVES IN PLACES THAT we we WE DON'T DO OURSELVES A favor &gt;&gt; by staying out of church. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T DO OURSELVES ANY FAVORS BY MAILING IT IN. YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING IT'S NOT JUST OTHERS THAT WE'RE HINDERING. It's ourselves. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE JUST GO through the motions in church, &gt;&gt; we're not doing anybody any favors. I'm not preaching at you cuz I don't know you. But I know this is true in our church, right? So you just pray for them poor folk in Arkansas. THEY GET TO FINDING FAULT AND PUNCHING AND EVERYTHING. THEY'RE NOT DOING THEMSELVES ANY FAVORS. BUT BECAUSE HE SAID THOSE WHO LIVE in that PLACE HAS TO SUFFER with the conditions of that place AND THOSE WHO DESIRE TO LIVE IN THAT KIND OF AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE EVERYTHING YOU SAY WHY WOULD A PERSON WANT TO LIVE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN hurt &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and and and they over and over again THINGS HAVE COME UP AND AND THEY SAY WELL I'M DONE WITH IT. I'M NOT THAT'S WHY PEOPLE DON'T EVEN GO TO CHURCH ANYMORE. DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IN GOING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD. DON'T EVEN DON'T EVEN PULL FOR THE PEOPLE OF GOD ANYMORE. LISTEN, IF YOU GOT TO A PLACE WHERE YOU ABSOLUTELY DIDN'T NEED TO EVER hear any preaching again and you say, "I'm so revelated. I don't NEED TO HEAR IT." WELL, YOUR PRESENCE THERE MIGHT HELP SOMEBODY ELSE. &gt;&gt; Like the deaf lady that went to church and asked HER SAID, "WHY? WHY DO YOU KEEP GOING TO CHURCH?" THEY SIGNED TO HER, "WHY DO YOU keep going to church?" AND SHE SIGNED BACK. SHE SAID, "BECAUSE I want the devil to know whose side I'm on." [applause] &gt;&gt; We've got a little old sister in our church. She's 92 years old. and and and we call her Sister Fritz. She sits in the back of the church. She sleeps through most of the service. It's hard for her to stay awake. She may listen to this. So, Sister Fritz, I you know, I I love you. But she'll she'll sit at the at the back of the church and and EVERY TIME SHE'S THERE, I WATCH MULTIPLE people go up to her and say, "Sister Prince, I'm glad you're here. You're an inspiration to us." And she told me, she said, "I feel you so useless at at this stage of my life. I I don't have anything I can give." I SAID, "BUT YOU BEING IN THE HOUSE OF GOD MEANS A LOT TO THE PEOPLE OF GOD." &gt;&gt; SO, IT GIVES COURAGE TO SOMEBODY ELSE TO FIGHT THE BATTLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I know she's praying for us, for my family tonight. I I thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only thing it needs is just water. &gt;&gt; It just needs a revival. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you know, there's a lot of things that you can solve. There's a lot of problems. money solves, but not spiritual problems. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of problems that that maybe a new job would solve, but not a spiritual problem. &gt;&gt; A lot of problems THAT MAYBE A NEW TOWN OR SOMETHING ELSE WOULD SOLVE, BUT NOT A SPIRITUAL PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; If you leave one place dry and go to another place, you'll bring dryness to that place. &gt;&gt; Somebody said they were looking for the perfect church, and they said, "Well, when you get there, it won't be perfect. But &gt;&gt; oh God, LET ME LET ME CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE PLACE WHERE I'M AT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; If everything's JUST PUNCHING AND FUSSING AND QUARRELING AND STEWING, he said, IF YOU DESIRE TO LIVE IN THAT PLACE, YOU'LL JUST LIVE UNDER THAT ATMOSPHERE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO LIVE THERE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT NECESSARY FOR US TO STAY THERE. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT TONIGHT? IT'S NOT NECESSARY FOR ME TO BE DRY. IT'S NOT NECESSARY FOR ME TO BE BACKSLID ALL THE TIME. IT'S NOT NECESSARY FOR ME TO FIGHT THE WORD IN MY MIND ALL THE TIME. LET ME COME TO A PLACE OF SUBMISSION. LET ME COME TO A PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING. LET ME COME TO A PLACE OF SAYING YES, LORD. WHEN WHATEVER YOU SAY, that's what I'll do. &gt;&gt; Praise Lord. &gt;&gt; When they took that bypass to horror, brother Brandon said, "Carnity cut off their spiritual supply. Carnality cut off all their joy and they began murmuring and fussing. They took them off in the desert." He said, "If there's anything I hate is a desert. It's hot. There's nobody hardly can live there. Everything you get against in the desert has got stickers on it. EVERY KIND OF LITTLE VINE'S GOT STICKERS. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S NO WATER THERE. He said if that same plant grew up somewhere else, he said THAT LITTLE PLANT WOULD NOT BE A STICKER. THAT LITTLE STICKER WOULD UNFOLD. IT WOULD BE A NICE TENDER LEAF WHEN it comes into a watered place. &gt;&gt; He said that's what's THE MATTER WITH THE CHURCHES. The reason they FUSS AND QUARREL AND STEW AND SO-CALLED CHRISTIANS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN BYPASSED FROM THE LAND OF BLESSING. FROM THE FOUNTAIN THAT NEVER RUNS DRY, FROM THE ROCK AND THE WEARY LAND, THEY BECOME DRY AND CARNAL. THEY WANT TO STICK AND SAY DAYS OF MIRACLES HAS PASSED. IT'S A BUNCH OF HOLY ROLLERS. NO SUCH THING AS THAT. HE SAID, "OH, JUST LET THEM COME TO THE WATER ONE TIME." &gt;&gt; THEY'LL JUST UNFOLD AND GET TENDER AND SWEET AND KIND AND HUMBLE. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Something takes place when you put him in water. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, brother Ben, explain that. Well, I'll tell you what a prophet said. He said, "I don't know why, but it happens that way." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. That's true. &gt;&gt; Glory. You say, "Well, I have everything I need. Why would I need to feel the presence of God?" I realize we don't go by feelings. I'm aware that we don't we we don't base what we believe on feel. There'll be times you don't feel it &gt;&gt; and you still believe. &gt;&gt; We don't base our salvation on whether we felt it because the rain falls on the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; But it falls on the just &gt;&gt; and the unjust. &gt;&gt; And without the rain, neither one can grow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in our efforts sometimes to not be false, we don't have anything. &gt;&gt; Say, "God, help me." Cuz I'm always the person want to stay right with the word. I want to be right with the word. And and we want to do that. We want to stay right with the word. But Lord, let me have the water with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They'd left the boasting physicians of Egypt to be with the great physician. had left the where the clothes weren't didn't even get threadbear and there wasn't a feeble among am one among them when they come from the wilderness and they were still complaining. He said they they left the people that said the days of miracles has passed to be with people that's got signs following. &gt;&gt; He said you come out of that old cold formal stuff got the Holy Ghost. God fills you with goodness. You're drinking from the fountain that never runs dry. All them things they're joy unspeakable full of glory. Then go to complaining. He said, "First thing you know, you're bypassed off in the desert." He said, "That's the way it does. It's just that way." He said, "God doesn't do it. The people does it themselves. Their own carnal thinking does it." So, that's a long answer to a short question. How did the desert get dry? &gt;&gt; The rain stopped. &gt;&gt; Why did the rain stop in Deuteronomy 11? And I'm trying to hurry here because we don't want to hold you very long. I was told a story. Forgive me. And when it's new people, you haven't heard my stories yet. And but uh I heard a story about a farmer who showed up. You've probably heard this one. And he showed up at a uh at at a church and he was the only one there. And that morning the pastor preached about two hours and he gets done and he finally walked out. He said, "Well, did you enjoy it?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "But you know what?" He said, "When?" He said, "When uh all of my cows come?" He said, "I I feed them a lot of grain." He said, "But don't give all the grain to one cow." So, we'll try to do our best. Deuteronomy 11:16-1 17. But I tell you what, let's have church. &gt;&gt; And the people that aren't here could say, "I we wish we were there." [snorts] &gt;&gt; Look, in Deuteronomy 11, it tells us that the Lord's, in an effort to tell you that I wasn't going to take much time, I took more time, didn't I? Well, praise the Lord. That's what we preachers are good at anyway. But listen, the Bible says that if they turned aside in Deuteronomy 11:16, from the gods from God and to the gods of this earth and served other gods, then the Lord's wrath would be kindled against them and and the heavens would be shut up. The heavens would be shut up. There'd be no rain. And it's a lack of what what it is is when idolatry comes in and there's a lack of preeminence given to the word. &gt;&gt; Then the reign of the spirit can't come because it's the reign of the spirit that anoints the word. It it WON'T ANOINT A LIFE FILLED with other things. So the WORD HAS GOT TO COME or return to a preeminent place in our lives. And and and if that doesn't happen, then the reign of the spirit stops. When when love for God and it's something about our heart, it's not about our heads. It's not how MUCH WE KNOW, BUT IT'S THAT LOVE IN OUR HEART FOR THE WORD OF GOD. WHEN THAT BEGINS TO STOP, THEN THE RAIN stops coming. And when THE RAIN STOPS COMING, THE DESERT GETS DRY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; How did the CHURCH AT PENTECOST, THINK ABOUT THIS FOR JUST a moment, THAT WAS ON FIRE FOR GOD TO THE POINT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE DRUNK? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. RIGHT. A CHURCH THAT WAS SO ON FIRE FOR GOD, WHEN PETER GOT PUT IN PRISON, THEY GOT TOGETHER AND PRAYED AND THE AND THE WALLS OF THE HOUSE SHOOK AND THE PRISON was opened. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; HOW DID THAT CHURCH BECOME THE Catholic Church, &gt;&gt; right? Like, how how does that even happen? Well, we could go back a little closer to home. How did the Pentecostal church leave 1906 and become what they are today? become a laughingstock in many cases where it's just about money and the and things are so out of order that the people even mock the gifts of God because they've been presented in such a way. &gt;&gt; How how did it GET THAT WAY IN A HUNDRED years or 120 years? Well, it's because they begin to try to in an effort to protect the word they that they had, they form denominations and they begin elevating other things above the word, their ideas above the word of God. THE BIBLE SAYS IN MATTHEW 24:12 that because iniquity shall abound, &gt;&gt; iniquity is what you know to do and you don't do it, but you know to do it. Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. That word wax is really interesting in the original. If you go look at it, it's actually to breathe gently. To breathe gently. So that if you had a some food in front of you, and I'm going to make you hungry now, but if you had whatever it is that you really enjoy, you know, hot, it's got to be hot. Salad is not hot. It steak is good hot, &gt;&gt; right? and you get a good steak in front of you and and and I don't know if you have good steak. I'm sure that you do here in the west and I've been looking for it. Haven't found it yet. But but but if you have that in front of you and you you just your breath, if you just begin to breathe on it like you know like you would for a child if you wanted to cool it off eventually just breathing will cool it down. &gt;&gt; Just a little bit of wind will cool it down. AND IT'S NOT A PROCESS THAT HAPPENS ALL AT ONCE, but everything just by nature gradually becomes cooler. &gt;&gt; So that's what that word wax means. It means to it's it's a uh it refers to an inanimate breeze, a reduction of temperature by evaporation. &gt;&gt; Now think about that for just a minute. A reduction of temperature by evaporation to wax cold. Now, now we know what evaporation is. Evaporation is water that that uh evaporates into the atmosphere. It's a So, like a cup of water. If we had a cup of water, I've got a bottle of water. If it if I took the lid off and just set it here, you wouldn't see much of a difference &gt;&gt; in that water just sitting there. In fact, YOU CAN SIT THERE ALL NIGHT and not see much of a difference. &gt;&gt; BUT SECOND BY SECOND, AS IT'S SITTING THERE, &gt;&gt; it's losing water. DID YOU KNOW THAT? JUST THE TIME THAT IT'S BEEN SITTING THERE, it's actually already lost measurable volume of water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see why we need the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; You see why we NEED TO HAVE CHURCH ON A REGULAR BASIS, RIGHT? We we NEED TO GET TOGETHER WITH other believers, not take hunting season off. At least not the whole thing. That may not be a thing here. It is back home. It's deer season back home. And so everybody's in the woods, but water evaporates. &gt;&gt; If you put this on a digital scale, you can't see it, but if you put it on a digital scale, it would actually evaporate. It loses 0.00001 gram of water every second. It takes about 16 minutes for a single drop to evaporate. But if you left that alone for 10 days, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; It would be nearly dry. CUZ AS IT EVAPORATES, IT COOLS and it loses its energy. If it was open, if it was open glass, it would be nearly dry in 10 days because it loses its energy. And so what it does is IT BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN. &gt;&gt; And as the molecules begin to slow down, it begins to evaporate into a mist and go into air. This is what happened TO THE EPHESIAN CHURCH age in Revelation 2:4. HE SAID, "NEVERTHELESS, I have somewhat against thee because thou hast LEFT THY FIRST LOVE." In other words, THE LOVE THAT YOU HAD FOR JESUS, THE LOVE YOU HAD FOR THE WORD, THE LOVE YOU HAD FOR THE PEOPLE OF GOD, [screaming] evaporated &gt;&gt; over time. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a breakup. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Had a young man in our church get broke up with on the parking lot one time. That's rough. But you know, that's not how it happened with the Ephesian church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THEY JUST DIDN'T SAY, "I don't need the Lord anymore. I don't NEED THE WORD ANYMORE. WE DON'T NEED PAUL'S WRITINGS ANYMORE. WE'D RATHER BE A BUNCH OF PAGANS." They didn't say that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what DID THEY DO? THEY LOST THEIR FIRST LOVE. &gt;&gt; They lost the energy of THEIR LOVE. THEY LOST THE THE FULLNESS OF THEIR love and it ended up in Catholicism. Brother Brandham described the process. who said that fervent desire to please God. I know I'm getting serious now, but we won't hold you all night. The fervent desire to please God, the passion to know his word, the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade. You see how it goes? It just evaporates. It begins to fade. It doesn't happen ALL AT ONCE. IT HAPPENS YEAR BY YEAR AND DAY BY DAY. LISTEN, YOU SAY, "WELL, I'VE BEEN A CHRISTIAN FOR A LONG TIME. I DON'T NEED TO HEAR PREACHING LIKE THIS." YOU MAY BE THE ONE WHO NEEDS TO HEAR IT THE MOST. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. BECAUSE HE SAID OVER TIME IT BEGINS TO FADE AND INSTEAD OF THE CHURCH BEING ON FIRE WITH THE FIRE OF [screaming] GOD HAS COOLED OFF AND BECOME A bit formal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's what was happening back there to the Ephesians. They were getting a bit formal. THE ABANDONMENT TO GOD WAS DYING OUT AND THE people weren't too CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT GOD THOUGHT OF THEM AS THEY BEGAN TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD THOUGHT OF THEM. THAT SECOND GENERATION COMING ON WAS JUST LIKE ISRAEL. They demanded A KING TO BE LIKE THE OTHER NATIONS WHEN THEY DID THAT. THEY REJECTED GOD. BUT THEY DID IT ANY ANYWAY. He said that is the history of the church. When it thinks more of conforming TO THE WORLD INSTEAD OF CONFORMING TO GOD, IT ISN'T LONG UNTIL YOU SEE THEM STOP DOING things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially. They change their manner of dress, THEIR ATTITUDES, THEIR BEHAVIOR. THEY get laxed. He said an emphasis means relaxed. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Drifting like the molecules in the water just slowing down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, when a desert when it's noticeably a desert, &gt;&gt; the rain's been gone for a long time. &gt;&gt; When it gets noticeable, &gt;&gt; and that's why you don't maybe notice until somebody's out of church. &gt;&gt; Huh? We should pray for our young people more than we've ever prayed for them. &gt;&gt; Should pray for our elders more than we've ever prayed for them. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just a process of time. Over time, the desert, it becomes a desert. It gets dry. You don't see it all at once. It's not measurable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe only with a digital scale, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe only by the Holy Ghost pricking us in the heart. &gt;&gt; Maybe nobody else would see it, but you tonight sitting there and saying, "Oh, I I I know I'm not exactly as full of the love of God as I was. I I want that in my life. &gt;&gt; I want that in my life. The rain been gone for a long time and now it's only a home for deformed plants. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fighting with each other for survival. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder sometimes I preach around the world and in the message churches, different places, and I don't have a big ministry. You probably never heard of me. May never hear of me again. But I'll say this. I've seen over and over again, it seems like we become a home just for deformed plants fighting with each other when we ought to be fighting the enemy. &gt;&gt; Not recognizing. &gt;&gt; There's something about that. Not recognizing. You know, you could live in a desert and you wouldn't know it until suddenly, wait a minute, &gt;&gt; what happened to the water? &gt;&gt; It just gets less and it gets less. And people who measure that might warn you, but you wouldn't think nothing of it until it was too far gone. Think of Samson who gave his heart to Delilah, gave his strength to God, but gave his heart to Delila and didn't know. &gt;&gt; See, when our relationship WITH GOD IS REPLACED BY our relationship WITH THE WORLD, THE WATER BEGINS to evaporate. &gt;&gt; In Judges 16 and 20, Delilah said, "The Philistines be upon THESE SAMSON." AND HE WOKE out of his sleep. And this is one of the one of the saddest scriptures in the Bible where he says, "I will go out as at other times before and shake myself." And he whisked not that the Lord was departed from him. How did the DESERT GET DRY? WHAT happened to the water? See, if we continue to treat the things of God carelessly, I'm not saying that you have, &gt;&gt; but if we do, and when we do, thinking we can pick them back up at any time, &gt;&gt; eventually we won't want to pick them up. &gt;&gt; Right. That's true. &gt;&gt; Some people, some young men have a call of God in their life, and they they neglect it and they go about and say, "Well, I'm going to go have my fill of the world." world and they do and it just lays there and eventually eventually maybe they've reached a place where they don't have the testimony or the ability. Oh, if they could only recognize that. Oh, if we could only recognize what God wants to do with us. You listen, you don't have to backside to be a believer. &gt;&gt; Say, well, I need a testimony. You've got a testimony. If you stay in the house of God and love God with all of your heart, young people, you got a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See what you say, but brother Ben, you told us all about this. What do we do about it? I'm glad you asked. &gt;&gt; We got to be planted by the rivers of water. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 17:5 said, "Thus sayith the Lord God, cursed be the man that trustth in man, maketh flesh his arm, whose heart departeth from the Lord, for he shall be like the heath." That's a that's a tumble weed. HE SHALL BE LIKE THE HEATH in the desert. Shall not see when GOOD COMETH. SO IN OTHER WORDS, THEY THEY GET SO DRY THAT THEY DISCONNECT from any root AND HAVE NO ABILITY TO RECONNECT. BUT YOU'RE NOT A HEATH. YOU'RE A PREDESTINED TREE. YOU'VE GOT ROOTS. WHICH MEANS NO MATTER HOW DRY YOU GET AT [screaming] THE TOP, THERE'S STILL A ROOT THERE BY THE RIVERS OF WATER. IF YOU CAN CONNECT WITH YOUR ROOTS AND DRINK MORE THAN YOUR PORTION, GOD WILL BRING IT UP AGAIN. &gt;&gt; He'll bring the fruit BACK IN THE TREE. OH, I'M SO THANKFUL FOR THAT, CHURCH. But the heath in the desert shall not see when good cometh, BUT SHALL INHABIT THE PARCHED PLACES IN THE WILDERNESS and the salt land and not inhabited, just a tumble weed, being pushed about by every wind of doctrine. But verse 7 said, "Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is, for he shall be AS A TREE PLANTED BY THE WATERS THAT SPREADTH OUT HER ROOTS BY THE RIVER. SHALL not see when heat cometh, but her leaf SHALL BE GREEN, AND SHALL NOT BE CAREFUL IN THE YEAR OF DROUGHT, NEITHER SHALL cease from yielding fruit. We must be planted by the rivers of water. The Bible says in John 7:38, "He that believeth on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers, rivers, NOT A LITTLE TRICKLE, BUT RIVERS OF LIVING WATER." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SEE, this message came to restore the word to its correct position so we could bear fruit. So we could have the rain fall again and produce something. Not just be a rain on a tear, but a rain on the wheat, a rain on the bride tree. The prophet said, it'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water. He said, "Grant, Lord, that the waters of life will water this bride tree in the last days where all the denominational branches have been pruned by THE HUSBANDMEN. AND NOW THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS LIVING A NEW IN THE top of the tree which come from the heart of the tree the WORD GRANT IT LORD AND MAY IT BRING FORTH MUCH fruit &gt;&gt; again he said the husbandman come BY AND TRIMMED OFF THE LEMONS and that that had been grafted in and all the denominational FRUIT HE PRUNED IT OFF BUT WHERE IS THE HEART OF THE TREE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE HE SAID HE PRUNED IT ALL DOWN TILL RIGHT IN THE TOP HE SAID HE'S GOT A SEED DOWN HERE IN THE ROOT LIKE A TREE THAT'S BEEN planted by the rivers of water listen I don't want us TO BE DISCOURAGED TONIGHT THERE'S IT'S A SEED DOWN IN THE ROOT OF YOUR LIFE THERE. YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE IF THERE WASN'T SOMETHING IN YOU TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; A seed in the root of your life that can be resurrected again when it smells the water. Amen. That's the question. Can you smell the water? I say that because brother Brandon TELLS THE STORY OF A DUCK. HE SAID THE DUCK HAD NEVER BEEN ON THE WATER. HE SAID BUT HE GOT OUT BEHIND THE BARN ONE TIME. HE WAS WITH THE CHICKENS ACTING LIKE THE CHICKENS, BUT HE GOT OUT BEHIND THE BARN ONE TIME AND HE SMELLED THE WATER. I WANT TO ASK YOU TONIGHT, CAN YOU SMELL THE WATER? CAN YOU UNDERSTAND [screaming] THAT GOD WANTS TO RAISE YOU UP? I BELIEVE THERE'S A PLACE for that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [sighs] &gt;&gt; The air is a little bit thinner up here at home. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Psalm 111, blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the seat way of sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the scornful, but his delight is in the law of the Lord. So what has he done? He's put Christ in his proper position. He's put him the word in preeminence in his law. He does meditate day and night. He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season. His leaf also shall not wither. &gt;&gt; IT DON'T MATTER HOW HOW MUCH DROUGHT THERE IS. IT DON'T MATTER HOW DRY IT GETS US AT CHURCH. WE'RE IN A HARD AGE. I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BE A BELIEVER TODAY. I KNOW THE YOUNG PEOPLE SUFFER TODAY MORE than any other age. I know there's anxiety out there and struggle, TROUBLE AND WORRY. I KNOW IT'S A HARD LIFE THAT THAT when you when you are a Christian, everybody laughs at you, makes fun OF YOU. BUT I'LL SAY THIS, YOU'RE PLANTED BY THE RIVERS OF WATER. YOU WERE BUILT TO OVERCOME IN THIS AGE. YOU WERE MADE TO OVERCOME. AS WE WERE WALKING THROUGH A CANYON THE OTHER DAY, AND RIGHT BY THE RIVER OF WATER WAS THESE GREAT BIG COTTONWOOD TREES. I BELIEVE IT WAS GREAT BIG TREES GROWING RIGHT THERE. AND I THOUGHT ONE OF THEM WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST TREES I'VE EVER SEEN. I TOOK A PICTURE BY IT WITH MY WIFE. I THOUGHT, "MY GOODNESS, HOW COULD A TREE LIKE THIS GROW IN A PLACE THAT'S A DESERT PLACE?" IT'S BECAUSE IT HAD ITS ROOTS BY THE RIVERS OF WATER. I SAID, "LET'S LET THIS CHURCH BECOME A PLACE." I BELIEVE IT IS. I BELIEVE IT'S LASTED THIS LONG BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE PLANTED BY THE RIVERS OF WATER. LET'S LET THE RAINS COME. LET'S LET THE WATER [screaming] BE DRAWN UP INTO THE HEART OF THE TREE to produce fruit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [panting] [snorts] There was must have there was a bridegroom tree and he come in the fullness of the word in this age and there is a restored bride tree on the earth I believe with all my heart brother Ben what do I do well ask simple isn't it &gt;&gt; but it's your heart do you get that you say well Lord it's in the rain it's just something got to be in your heart. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; There's got to be something in your heart when you sing. Something in your heart when you preach, something in your heart when you pray. God, I need [laughter] the water. When Jesus talked about that widow woman that that went before an unjust judge and and she con constantly went before him and knocked on his door and said, "WOULD YOU WOULD YOU MAKE MY CASE RIGHT? WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME?" AND HE SAID, "FINALLY, THE JUDGE did it just because she kept knocking." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How much MORE HAVE WE GOT A GOOD GOD WHO WANTS TO GIVE US GOOD THINGS? WE DON'T SERVE AN UNJUST JUDGE. WE SERVE A GREAT KING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. We are not a widow seeking an unjust judge. We're the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Ask you of the Lord reign in the time of the latter rain." Ask of the Lord reign in the time of the latter rain. Well, listen, we still have to ASK YOU. SO, I'M WAITING ON A REVIVAL. BROTHER BROWN SAID, "YOUR CHURCH REVIVAL IS NOT THE REVIVAL FOR YOU, BUT THE REVIVAL FOR YOU BEGINS IN YOUR HEART." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ASK OF THE LORD RAIN. OH, HOW MANY CAN ASK TONIGHT? I, AS I'M NEARING A CLOSE, I BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO ASK THE LORD FOR RAIN IN THE TIME OF THE LATTER RAIN. SO, SHALL THE LORD make bright CLOUDS AND GIVE THEM SHOWERS OF RAIN TO EVERYONE GRASS IN THE FIELD. ASK. Matthew 7:7, "Ask and it shall be given you. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be opened &gt;&gt; unto you." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a story in Judges 1. Judges 1:15 talks about Caleb. You know, Caleb had a daughter and Caleb was such a man of faith, his daughters inherited. I love that his daughter inherited land. And yet, but she didn't get prime land. And I love her story because she doesn't, you know, she doesn't blame her dad for not giving her the best part of the land. But the Bible act actually says he gave her a dry place, a a south land. If you go look it up, it's a south land. It's actually a part of the Ngev desert. He gave her a portion of desert. Now, why would he give her that? And I think so many TIMES WE WONDER, LORD, WHY WOULD YOU PUT ME WHERE YOU PUT ME? WHY? Why Hardy, Arkansas or Flagstaff, Arizona? WHY THIS FAMILY? WHY THIS CHURCH? WHY? Why I'm at? BUT SHE DIDN'T SAY, "GIVE ME another piece of land." Because the land come from God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right? And you are where you are for a reason. &gt;&gt; AND EVEN THE TRIALS OF LIFE HAPPEN FOR A REASON. THINGS THAT ARE [screaming] GOING ON right now. And you say, "Well, IT'S A TRIAL." BUT MAYBE IT'S A TIME FOR YOU TO STEP UP AND SAY, "LORD, LORD, RIGHT NOW, HELP ME. HELP ME TO THRIVE IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU PLANTED ME." &gt;&gt; But we have all kinds of things happen. And she was given a a difficult time. Listen, we got to live in Leodosa. &gt;&gt; Right? We don't get the first church age or the second or even the the sixth. We get the seventh. &gt;&gt; We got to live during this time. AND IT'S THE BRIDE TIME. &gt;&gt; YES, IT IS. SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WAY WE live and the way the world lives is greater than it's ever been. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE TIME &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORLD'S GOING INSANE and we're not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; SO SHE SO CALEB'S DAUGHTER, HER NAME WAS AXA. SHE COME TO HIM AND SHE SAID SHE said she she was GOING TO ASK HIM. IN FACT, SHE asked her husband to ask him and he WOULDN'T DO IT. SO she did it herself. SHE COME DOWN OFF OF HER DONKEY AND SHE SAID, she said, "You've given me a southland. You've given me a dry place. Give me also springs of water." You'll find that in Judges 1:15. SHE SAID, "GIVE ME ALSO springs of water." SO, SHE RECOGNIZED IF I'M GOING TO LIVE IN A DRY PLACE, I NEED A SPRING THAT won't fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; If Oh, young people, IF YOU COULD JUST RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE LIVING IN A LATE TIME, BUT IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO HAVE WATER. IT'S NOT TOO [screaming] LATE TO HAVE REVIVAL IN YOUR HEART. IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO RAISE A FAMILY. IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO BELIEVE FOR EVERYTHING THAT GOD HAS GIVEN YOU. LISTEN, YOU'VE GIVEN ME A DRY LAND. YOU PUT ME IN A DIFFICULT SPOT. SOME OF YOU MAY BE SUFFERING IN YOUR BODY WITH SICKNESS or disease. HE'S YOU'VE BEEN PUT IN A DIFFICULT SPOT, BUT HE'S GIVEN YOU A DRY LAND. MAYBE YOU GOT TO PUT UP WITH IT. YOU'RE GETTING OLDER. MAYBE YOU GOT TO PUT UP WITH THE ACHES AND THE PAINS, BUT LORD, YOU'VE GIVEN ME A DRY LAND. DON'T LET ME DO WITHOUT THE WATER. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GIVEN ME A SOUTH END. YOU'VE GIVEN ME A DESERT TO WALK THROUGH, but I need the water. Plant me by the rivers of water. Give me also springs of water. As the musicians come tonight, I think all we need [sighs] is a little rain. All the effort that my grandpa would make in the field didn't do a whole lot of good until the rain came. A [snorts] few years ago, the Sea of Galilee [snorts] had reached the spot where where they thought it was actually going to cease to exist. the place where Jesus walked on the water and Peter went out fishing as we already heard about tonight. That place was actually in danger of not existing anymore. There's three lines. There's actually a a marker that you can see if you go online, you can look at it. It's a great big marker and it shows that there's three levels that the lake can go to. And the upper line is 685 ft below sea level. If you can play pass me n gentle savior. I know it's a Wednesday night. I'm sorry I've held you a little bit long, but there's a there's an upper red line and and that line is where a flood starts. There's a lower red line which is 699 ft. The upper red line is a certain uh foot high and low red line 699 ft where pumping should stop. But just below that is the black line. It's only a few feet difference in this great body of water, inland sea or what we would think of as a lake. There's only a few feet difference between when they start to go dry and irreversible damage. And the black line was reached in November 2001. And for years, the lake remained desperately low. They tried all sorts of things. They brought water in trucks and dumped it in the in this lake because they were so desperate. They take water and desalinate it. Spend millions of dollars. Desalinate water, bring it out of the ocean and bring it to the Sea of Tiberius, the Sea of Galilee. They tried everything. I don't know if you remember because right before CO in 2019, a miracle happened. You remember that? They tried all sorts of things, but they started showing up in the news. It started to rain just inexplicably. I believe God keeps his promises. Oh, hallelujah. It started to rain. You see, they didn't need trucks. They didn't need fancy equipment. None of it was sufficient. WHAT THEY NEEDED WAS RAIN. &gt;&gt; And when they got the rain, it solved the problem. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And &gt;&gt; today, the Lord, &gt;&gt; it's almost completely full of rain. I want to ask you today with every head bowed and every eye closed. I know it's Wednesday night. I sometimes we tend to kind of go through the motions and God help us tonight. I I just want to ask you what while you're sitting where you are, well, the presence of the Lord I believe is here. Where's your marker at? Is it full? Brother Brham said, "When were you most happy as a Christian? When when were you closest to him?" He said, "That day ought to be today." Where's your marker at? Maybe it's just kind of evaporated over time and gone down into that black level. And we can be honest about that. I'll be honest with you, church. I many times first one at the altar at our church cuz I know I know what it takes takes miracles for God God has to do something for me to be a pastor and for us to be successful and I realize my insufficiency maybe we all should tonight recognize that pumping water in's not going to help program is not going to help the the world's not going to help making a a church like Joel Ostein isn't going to help What do we need? We need the rain. &gt;&gt; And it's here for us. See, the bride revival is not something we're looking for. It's going on right now. It's been going on ever since the word was open to us. The revival's been here. We just got to participate in it. A miracle took place. It rained and the lake filled up. I pray that a miracle would take place tonight in every heart. If that's you, maybe you're at that black line, that red line, whatever it is. Would you just raise your hand? Say, "Lord, I need the rain. I need your spirit. I need to know that you're here with me." Like Moses said, "I don't WANT TO GO IF YOU DON'T GO WITH ME. I DON'T WANT TO go to work without your presence. I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME WITHOUT YOUR PRESENCE. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER service without the presence of the Lord. Let him anoint me for the service that he has for me to do. You just pray that way tonight and I'll pray with you. I just believe the Lord will help. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we love you tonight and we thank you for being here with us, Lord, on a Wednesday night. Though these people don't know me, Lord, and I don't know very many of them, but I know you, Lord. You're the same God here as you are back in Arkansas or any other place. And I know, Lord, that we need the rain. I know God that our heads are bowed now as the wheat and the tears both had their heads bowed waiting on the rain and they both rejoiced when it came. But we need it Lord and we believe we are the wheat today. The tear the shuck is pulled away. But Lord, here we are at the end time. We need the rain. We need the presence of God. We don't WANT MAN-MADE DEMONSTRATION. WE DON'T NEED A WORKUP. We need the rain. Oh, help us, Lord. [laughter] Oh, God. We love you tonight. I pray you'd bring it in every heart in my heart, Lord. The hearts of my family. Oh, in my church, Lord, as their service is probably already completed. Lord, all over the world, Lord, as your brides gathered together on a Wednesday night, I pray, oh God. May your rainfall, oh granted, Lord Jesus, may Flagstaff, Arizona, Lord, as we each want to seek seek you, Lord. If I never come back, may it never be the same. Pray you grant it, Lord. It's not about the man behind the pulpit, but it's about your word and your promise. You said, "Ask of rain in the time of the latter rain." And I believe, Lord, that's where we're living. Oh [snorts] God, ask of rain in the time of the latter rain, you shall receive what you ask for. I pray you'd grant it. We believe it, Lord. By faith, we claim it and we believe it tonight in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's just worship him. If you need prayer, I be glad to pray with you. I don't think that'd be out of order, but let's just worship him now. Other [singing] shores [music] [music] [music] [singing] [music] Hey, [singing] [music] won't [music and singing] you hear my [music and singing] humble cry? Why you bringing RAIN FOR OTHERS?

He's right here among us, and [music] he wants to talk to you for a minute. Just talk back to him, oh God. Tell him you love him. Tell him how much you you miss being in his presence.

It was a blessing to me, brother. Um I hope you and your wife have an enjoyable [music] time here in Arizona.
