[16:17] [singing]
[16:25] [music]
[16:27] Just want to mention before open us in a
[16:30] word of prayer. Open us up. Brother
[16:32] [music] Dawn is in the hospital. uh
[16:35] pneumonia and then that caused the aphib
[16:38] to kick in again and
[16:42] um so we want to remember brother Dawn
[16:45] and of course the [music] family Viven
[16:48] uh and her fam her family will have the
[16:51] funeral announced when uh when they let
[16:54] us know. They're supposed to let us know
[16:55] very soon and so we'll announce that.
[16:57] It'll probably be uh
[17:00] either [music] going to be Tuesday of
[17:02] next week or Friday, Saturday. So, um,
[17:05] we'll be sure to let the church know
[17:06] about that, but be in prayer for their
[17:08] family. And, um, you know, Brother Dawn,
[17:13] I cry out sometimes for help a little
[17:15] bit cuz I see the Brother Dons and the
[17:17] Brother Rays and the Brother Tom's and
[17:20] Brother Bobs, that generation not
[17:23] getting any younger. And there's very
[17:26] few men [music] like Brother Dawn.
[17:29] So, remember him and the family in
[17:31] prayer.
[17:34] Let's just pray.
[17:37] Lord, thank you [music] for tonight.
[17:39] Just a time set aside to come and learn
[17:42] of you and sit at your table.
[17:45] I was just thinking about these [music]
[17:47] needs and as I was driving up here to
[17:49] Flagstaff listening to a message and
[17:53] brother Random was talking about that
[17:55] that speckled bird,
[17:58] that one bird that was sprinkled with
[18:00] the blood of the other and was allowed
[18:03] to fly away.
[18:06] Lord, you gave your life so that we
[18:08] could fly away.
[18:10] So Lord, I'm just asking that
[18:13] you would move on these needs [music]
[18:14] and that you would just be the peace to
[18:17] these people that have needs, Lord, and
[18:19] just [music] have uncertainty in their
[18:20] life right now. And just as we're here
[18:23] this evening, Lord, and we're just here
[18:26] to learn of you, Lord, we just ask that
[18:27] [music] you'd come and teach us, Lord,
[18:29] and just be the dissolver of doubts.
[18:32] Give us a refueling, Lord. always seems
[18:35] like Wednesdays
[18:37] is just under [music] attack always. I
[18:40] always feel like that deer that just
[18:42] knew if he could get to that stream
[18:46] that he'd be all [music] right.
[18:48] Well, we're here tonight, Lord, and we
[18:49] just ask that you'd come give us a
[18:52] drink. We just ask [music] you in your
[18:54] name. Amen.
[18:57] Praise the Lord. [music] Um it's
[18:59] Wednesday. Brother Donald uh couldn't
[19:03] make it and and let me know and
[19:06] um so you got the a fifth or sixth
[19:09] string song leader. I don't know where I
[19:11] fall in the thing there, brother Tom,
[19:14] but um bear with me. I'm going to leave
[19:16] you standing just for a minute if that's
[19:18] be all right. Brother William, that song
[19:21] keeps me singing. He keeps me singing.
[19:24] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Sweetest name I
[19:26] know. There's within my heart. I
[19:29] remember. How many remember sister Mary?
[19:31] She'd sit back over there wherever she
[19:33] would be singing it and you could just
[19:34] hear her voice belting it out. Something
[19:37] I'll never forget and blesses me.
[19:40] There's within my heart a meloy
[19:45] Jesus whispers sweet [singing] and
[19:50] fear not I with thee peace be
[19:54] [music and singing] still in all of my
[19:57] heaven
[20:00] Jesus Jesus Jesus [music and singing]
[20:05] sweetest name I
[20:10] He fills my every longing. [singing]
[20:15] Keeps me singing as [singing] I [music]
[20:18] go.
[20:20] I want to as William learns the tune and
[20:23] the melody. I read about the song about
[20:25] a half hour ago. Pull up that verse too
[20:27] there. Sister Pauline, [music] the man
[20:29] who wrote the song, his wife and three
[20:32] children were killed. It's uh brother
[20:35] Tom would probably known Brides I think
[20:38] his wife and three children were killed
[20:40] in a fire and then he wrote this song. I
[20:44] imagine like you might write a sad song
[20:46] or you might write a whatever song but
[20:48] he wrote it keeps me singing as I go and
[20:51] especially the second verse he pinned it
[20:53] in the hurt and [music] the frustration
[20:55] of his heart.
[20:58] All [singing] my life was wrecked by sin
[21:02] and strifilled
[21:05] my life with me. [music and singing]
[21:10] Jesus swept across the broken strings.
[21:15] [music] Stir the suffering
[21:19] [singing] again.
[21:21] Oh Jesus. Jesus, [music and singing]
[21:24] Jesus,
[21:27] sweetest day I [singing]
[21:33] fills [music] my every
[21:38] [music]

[22:39] He fills my every [singing]
[22:44] [music]
[22:45] and keeps me singing as I
[22:51] &gt;&gt; may be seated. We'll sing a [music]
[22:53] another one here. What about my sins are
[22:56] gone?
[22:57] &gt;&gt; You ask me why I'm happy
[22:59] &gt;&gt; and I will just tell you why.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Because

[23:14] So, I'll just tell you why. Because
[23:19] [music]
[23:19] my sins are gone.
[23:23] And when I meet the [singing] scoffers,
[23:26] they ask me where they are. I say,
[23:30] [singing]
[23:31] "My sins are [music] gone." Where they
[23:33] at, Brother Steve? There underneath
[23:36] [singing] the left on the cross of

[23:47] God's forgetfulness, that's good enough
[23:50] for me. Praise God. Oh, my sins are
[23:55] gone. [singing]
[23:57] It was at this old [music] time altar
[24:00] where God came in my heart. And now
[24:04] [singing]
[24:05] all my sins are gone.
[24:08] The Lord took full possession. The devil
[24:13] did depart. I'm so [singing] very glad
[24:16] my sins are gone.
[24:19] And [singing] there underneath the blood
[24:23] on the cross of Calvary. [singing]
[24:26] As far removed as darkness is from now.
[24:31] There in the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[24:33] [singing]
[24:34] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[24:39] My sins [singing] are gone.
[24:42] When Satan comes to tempt me, oh, he
[24:46] tries to make me die. I say [singing]
[24:51] my sins are gone.
[24:54] [music] You got me into trouble, but
[24:58] Jesus [singing] got me out. I'm glad
[25:02] my sins [singing] are gone where they
[25:05] are there underneath the blood on
[25:09] [singing] the cross of Calvary. [music]
[25:12] As far removed as darkness is from now
[25:17] in the sea of God's [singing]
[25:19] forgetfulness. That's [music] good
[25:21] enough for me. Praise God.
[25:25] My sins are gone. [singing]
[25:28] And I'm living now for Jesus. I'm happy
[25:33] and [singing] because
[25:37] my sins are gone.
[25:40] My [music] soul is [singing] filled with
[25:42] music. With all my heart I say, I know
[25:48] that my sins are gone. [singing]
[25:51] [music]
[25:51] They are underneath the blood on the
[25:55] cross of Calvary. [singing]

[30:39] [screaming]
[30:47] cruel.
[30:58] [screaming]
[31:05] Oh
[31:08] W
[31:48] At the cross. Let's all stand. At the
[31:51] cross [singing] where [music] I first
[31:53] saw and
[31:56] my heart
[31:58] [music]
[32:00] [singing] was there.
[32:04] Heat. Heat. [music]
[32:08] [singing]
[32:10] [music]
[32:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[32:20] [singing]
[32:22] [music]
[32:25] &gt;&gt; I see myself
[32:28] and
[32:29] [music] happy
[32:34] playing that brother William. So I asked
[32:36] brother Ryan if we would take up the
[32:40] topic again a word to the church. I
[32:43] think he spoke on the 23rd of November
[32:46] and just kind of keep down that thought
[32:48] again. And then at the end of the
[32:51] service this evening, Lord willing,
[32:53] brother Everett wanted to get baptized
[32:57] and uh did it when he was younger, but
[32:59] sometimes we don't understand and uh so
[33:02] he wanted to do again and really have
[33:04] that uh to do it again. So, praise the
[33:07] Lord for that. And so I knowing that I
[33:10] said, "Brother Ryan, we'll have we'll do
[33:11] this Wednesday and then the 7th of
[33:13] January we'll do it again.
[33:16] I don't know if you can learn this
[33:17] subject enough, but you've probably uh
[33:21] Oh, and Jeremiah, by the way, I got to
[33:24] say this. We're walking into the built
[33:25] to I was just showed brother [music]
[33:28] Everett the baptismal and then walked
[33:30] him back to the sanctuary and he was
[33:32] saying, "Brother Steve, my mind, you
[33:33] know, it just it's hurting me and it's
[33:35] starting, you [music] know, I'm
[33:36] struggling." And and Jeremiah goes, "God
[33:39] can heal that."
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Wow,
[33:44] out of the mouth of babes." Brother
[33:46] Jeremiah, you nailed it. You absolutely
[33:49] nailed it right on the head, brother. He
[33:51] said, "God can heal that."
[33:54] So that's faith right there, saints. And
[33:56] I believe it and I claim it. Yes. So,
[33:59] [music] praise the Lord. Anyway, so
[34:01] that's on the agenda tonight and looking
[34:03] forward to what the Lord has in store
[34:05] for us as we go forward. We'll sing this
[34:06] as brother Ryan comes
[34:09] [singing and music] at the cross of the
[34:11] cross where I first
[34:17] [music]
[34:25] [music]

[34:42] [singing]
[34:46] [music]
[34:53] happy all [music] the time.
[34:56] Amen. God bless you this evening.
[34:58] Appreciate that song service and
[35:01] appreciate uh brother Steve wearing
[35:03] multiple hats
[35:04] &gt;&gt; and um and everyone that has come out on
[35:07] a Wednesday night. Really just
[35:08] appreciate that. Um
[35:11] I just uh we always want to give the
[35:13] Lord room to do something in our lives,
[35:15] right?
[35:16] &gt;&gt; And uh so let's just uh as um before we
[35:18] have you seated, before we approach the
[35:20] word, always want to start with a prayer
[35:22] to the Lord. Amen. Let's just bow our
[35:23] heads and heavenly father Jesus, we just
[35:26] love you. We trust in you, Lord. We we
[35:28] we don't know anything else, Lord, but
[35:30] you.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; I don't want to know anything else but
[35:33] you, Lord. I only want to be, Lord,
[35:35] under your leadership, Lord, under your
[35:38] headship, under your word, Father. And
[35:40] Lord, would you just um Lord, in this
[35:43] day that's it's dark, Lord. It's
[35:44] confusing for a lot of people, Lord.
[35:46] Would you just continue to make yourself
[35:48] clear and known to us, Lord? We're
[35:50] looking for you, Lord. We believe in you
[35:53] more than just words, Lord. More than
[35:54] just um something that we repeat,
[35:57] Father. We we really want to to throw
[35:59] ourselves upon your mercy, Lord, and
[36:02] your grace, Lord, and and really dive
[36:04] into your word, Father. We thank you for
[36:06] giving us such a pure word and truth,
[36:09] Lord, to to to live by, to study, and to
[36:13] hear, Lord, and to feed on, Father. And
[36:15] so I pray that you would just bless all
[36:17] those Lord that have come with an
[36:19] expectation on their heart to hear from
[36:21] you. Lord, I have never once seen you
[36:23] disappoint them, Father. I come with an
[36:25] expectation on my heart to hear from
[36:27] you, Lord. And so we just want to make
[36:28] you welcome.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; We've sang we've sang songs to you of
[36:32] praise, Lord. We're I believe that we're
[36:34] feel energized, but Lord, a word from
[36:36] you would mean so much today, Father. So
[36:37] we just want to approach your word now
[36:40] and get out of the way, Lord. Would you
[36:41] just protect your pulpit? Protect your
[36:43] word, Father. protect the hearts of the
[36:45] believers in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you
[36:47] musicians.
[36:49] Uh while you're standing, we'll just
[36:50] take a quick scripture.
[36:53] Um
[36:54] I almost uh
[36:58] I almost forgot to find a scripture
[36:59] before I wrote came out. I was uh I was
[37:02] so busy
[37:04] with notes and all these other things
[37:05] that I was like, "Okay, I'm ready to
[37:07] go." And then I realized I didn't have a
[37:09] scripture to start with. So, uh, just,
[37:12] uh, quickly, um, found one that I think
[37:15] was very appropriate in Mark, um,
[37:17] chapter 7. And, uh, just want to say I
[37:20] really appreciate, um,
[37:22] the the messages that our pastor has
[37:25] been bringing. Um, just been very
[37:27] edifying to me. I've, um, just
[37:30] appreciate the correction that the Lord
[37:32] has brought unto me. Um, I just, um, it
[37:35] makes me love him more.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It makes me love him more and it
[37:39] makes me it makes me know that I'm a I'm
[37:42] a child of God that he's that he's
[37:45] willing to come and just straighten me
[37:46] out and uh I believe that we show him
[37:48] we're a child by receiving it.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; So I just appreciate I know it's not
[37:52] easy to do but uh it's the right thing
[37:56] to do. Amen. So Mark chapter 7 um we
[37:58] just read this real quick a few verses
[38:00] here. Let's start with verse one. They
[38:02] came together unto him, the Pharisees
[38:04] and certain of the scribes which came
[38:06] from Jerusalem. And when they saw some
[38:09] of his disciples eat bread with defiled,
[38:11] that is to say, with unwashing hands,
[38:14] they found fault. For the Pharisees and
[38:17] all the Jews, except they wash their
[38:19] hands off, eat not, holding the
[38:22] tradition of the elders.
[38:27] Verse five. When the Pharisees and
[38:29] scribes asked him, why walk not thy
[38:31] disciples according to the tradition of
[38:33] the elders, but eat bread with unwashing
[38:36] hands. A little spoiler, but that
[38:38] question is asked of you today.
[38:43] Why do you not walk according to the
[38:45] tradition of the elders?
[38:48] And he answered and said unto them,
[38:49] Well, hath Isaiah prophesied of you
[38:51] hypocrites, as it is written, this
[38:53] people honorth me with their lips, but
[38:55] their heart is far from me. How be it in
[38:57] vain do they worship me, teaching for
[39:00] doctrines the commandments of men? For
[39:02] laying aside the commandment of God,
[39:05] you hold the tradition of men as the
[39:08] washing of pots and cups and many other
[39:10] such things,
[39:12] many other such light things you do. And
[39:15] he said unto them, full well you reject
[39:17] the commandment of God that you may keep
[39:20] your own tradition.
[39:23] For Moses said, "Honor thy father and
[39:25] mother, and who so cursseth father and
[39:26] mother, let him die the death. But ye
[39:28] say, if a man shall say to his father
[39:29] and mother, it is corbin," that is to
[39:31] say, a gift by whatsoever thou might be
[39:33] profited by me, he shall be free. And
[39:35] you suffer him no more to do for his
[39:37] father and mother, making the word of
[39:39] God of none effect
[39:41] through your tradition, which ye have
[39:44] delivered, and many such like things do
[39:47] ye." And we could continue to read that.
[39:50] and he just really gives us scouring.
[39:53] Um you may be seated to um I'm not
[39:55] really wanted to preach on tradition.
[39:57] It's not really the plan. We wanted to
[39:59] go over this uh word to the church. I
[40:00] think um
[40:04] um look at the time here. I did not
[40:06] bring my watch with me.
[40:10] Praise the Lord. We have a baptism
[40:11] tonight. So we definitely want to make
[40:12] way for that and not take too much time
[40:15] this evening. But could we just set
[40:16] aside a little bit of time to go through
[40:18] this? Um, we wanted to talk about the
[40:20] the brother Steve wanted to stay on this
[40:22] subject and I agreed with him about a
[40:24] word to the church. It's not something
[40:26] you can cover in a service. It's not
[40:27] going to be covered in two services.
[40:29] It's not going to be covered in three or
[40:30] four or five. Um, I think we pretty
[40:32] thoroughly went through the word to the
[40:35] church last time, but I thought, you
[40:36] know, rather than read through it again
[40:38] and and uh take up that time, I just
[40:40] printed out with Steve's permission, I
[40:42] just printed out the word of the church
[40:43] that we have out there if anybody wanted
[40:45] one. And I was pretty optimistic. I
[40:49] printed out like 35 of them. And I was
[40:50] like, well, why don't I just print out
[40:53] like 50 of them and then maybe 50 people
[40:55] will show up. And so, I'm not saying my
[40:57] faith like filled up the church or
[40:59] anything, but I was just like, I'm not
[41:00] going to set the expectation though if
[41:01] anybody would want one. Uh maybe you
[41:03] could just take one and pass it around.
[41:05] I think there's maybe 40 or 50 there.
[41:07] So, and maybe just to I want I have one.
[41:09] I kept one for my notebook just to have
[41:11] have with me. So, we're not going to go
[41:13] through this whole thing again. And um
[41:16] not not to to say it that way that's not
[41:18] important, but really just read this.
[41:19] And I think we covered it last time what
[41:21] he's instructing us to do. Amen. And
[41:23] what he's what he's what he's urging
[41:25] what he's really uh urging the church,
[41:27] the believers, us to do. Amen. We
[41:29] covered it, I think, very thoroughly.
[41:32] But what I wanted to um with the help of
[41:35] the Lord, what I wanted to more cover
[41:37] was just the the the the maybe the core
[41:41] theme behind the word of the church. So,
[41:43] you could have it. You could read
[41:44] through it and and it certainly should
[41:46] be a blessing. It gives us a lot of
[41:48] things, Amen. to do. Would you agree
[41:51] with that?
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Uh, how many feel like when you read
[41:54] that, those are easy things to do?
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Okay. I didn't feel like they were easy
[41:59] things to do. When I read it, I'm going
[42:00] to be honest, I feel a little bit
[42:01] intimidated. I feel a little bit uh
[42:06] um what is the word I'm thinking of? Um
[42:08] I'm just not able to do it without the
[42:11] Lord. That is true.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; And that's the whole point of the word
[42:13] of the church. The whole thing, if we
[42:15] really just take the whole word to the
[42:17] church, the whole thing can be wrapped
[42:19] up in that. It's it's a it's a it's an
[42:21] instruction. It's a it's a map of
[42:25] increasing and decreasing.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; So, if you read through the whole thing,
[42:29] he's going to tell you, you know, this
[42:30] situation uh is going to happen. And
[42:33] when the situation happens, this is what
[42:35] you should do. you should not do this
[42:39] &gt;&gt; or when the situation happens, you
[42:41] should do more of this. It's an increase
[42:43] and it's a decrease. And if you just
[42:45] read through that with maybe that in
[42:46] mind, it it it it really kind of pops
[42:48] out. You look at if somebody's going to
[42:50] if somebody's going to uh come in and
[42:53] they're going to start trouble, they're
[42:54] going and we kind of like I said, we
[42:55] covered this. I want you to cling that
[42:57] much closer together. Amen.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; So, it's not just about staying where
[43:02] we're at or staying in in in the the
[43:04] status quo, as they would say. It's not
[43:06] just about maintaining the level of
[43:08] where you're at as a believer in the
[43:10] church. It's listen, when these things
[43:11] come in, and you know how the Lord knows
[43:13] that they're going to come in is because
[43:14] he's going to send them.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Now, he says, now Satan's going to shoot
[43:19] some guy full of venom. And but Satan
[43:21] can't do a single thing without going to
[43:23] the Lord and saying, "Hey, do you got
[43:26] these people on a pedestal? Sound
[43:28] familiar? You got these people kind of
[43:30] covered up and I bet you if I just cause
[43:32] a little bit of they're they'll curse
[43:34] you.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; And he says, you know what? Why don't
[43:36] you go ahead? Just don't touch their
[43:37] life.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; And he has to come and ask. So God knows
[43:40] these things are going to come and he's
[43:42] saying just maintaining who you are as a
[43:44] believer is not going to get you
[43:47] through.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; There must be a decrease of you and an
[43:52] increase of me. Because when I read
[43:53] through this just this little couple of
[43:55] paragraphs, I really quickly realize
[43:58] that no matter how good uh I tried to
[44:01] act and no matter the strongest
[44:04] willpower that I could have, I could not
[44:07] 100% perform the things on this piece of
[44:10] paper.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; And listen, can I just I'll just take
[44:12] the pressure right off of of anybody who
[44:14] thinks that they can. If you could, then
[44:17] you get the glory and God doesn't.
[44:21] So if you could do these things,
[44:24] &gt;&gt; then you are God.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; And so wouldn't you think that maybe he
[44:30] puts things in this little paragraph, a
[44:32] couple paragraphs that he knows you
[44:34] can't do without him?
[44:36] &gt;&gt; And that's what the test or that's what
[44:38] the the the test or the trial really is.
[44:40] You know, the test, you know, sometimes
[44:43] um I mean, the way that I've looked at a
[44:46] test, and I'm just going to kind of
[44:47] speak for myself. I can't speak for you.
[44:49] Sometimes the way that I've looked at a
[44:50] test or a trial when it comes from God
[44:52] is that sometimes I think that well God
[44:54] is kind of uh he's kind of beating up on
[44:58] me.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; God's kind of uh putting me really
[45:01] putting me through the ringer. He's
[45:03] really And then we see all these
[45:05] analogies that are in the message and in
[45:07] the Bible, you know, when the when the
[45:08] the master craftsman is beating on the
[45:10] gold, right? And and the these things
[45:13] are true. I'm not saying that they're
[45:14] not true. when he's beating on the gold
[45:15] and when I'm going through this trial
[45:17] with through this test I think okay
[45:19] that's just the Lord beating on me and
[45:21] but I I want to just give you a little
[45:23] bit of a perspective I think change on
[45:25] this um this is a this is a change for
[45:28] me um God is not cruel
[45:31] &gt;&gt; he's not
[45:32] &gt;&gt; and and God does not want you to fail
[45:35] &gt;&gt; God does not want you to be defeated God
[45:37] does not want you to be without victory
[45:39] in your life but if if you do not
[45:41] recognize who God is then We'll start to
[45:44] think of him like I I have thought of
[45:46] him as sometimes as as somebody who is
[45:48] cruel and somebody who's testing me as
[45:50] we heard just in the service ago,
[45:51] testing me beyond that thing that I can
[45:54] handle.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says he doesn't do that.
[45:56] He makes that way of escape, right? But
[45:58] he's going to take you right up to that
[45:59] edge. And the the test is actually not
[46:03] him beating on the gold.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; See what it the test is when he picks up
[46:08] the gold and tries to see his face in
[46:10] the gold. That's the trial. Yeah,
[46:13] &gt;&gt; that's the trial. I' I've had it
[46:14] backwards for a really long time. Oh,
[46:16] the beating is the trial. No, no. When
[46:18] he can't see himself through the trial,
[46:20] he goes, "Okay, I'm going to go ahead
[46:21] and I'm just going to keep I'm going to
[46:23] take the clay. It doesn't look like I
[46:26] want it to look like I put it into the I
[46:28] put it in the kiln and it blew apart.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; I'm going to start over again."
[46:33] &gt;&gt; And I got all the time in the world to
[46:35] form you and to make you. And maybe you
[46:37] think, "Oh man, I just can't handle
[46:39] another." But you can handle it because
[46:41] he's the one doing it. And so the test
[46:43] is not the beating.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; It's not these things. The test is when
[46:49] he wants to see himself in you. That's
[46:52] the test. And so the test is not that
[46:55] you can do these things.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Do do I believe that we should be do do
[47:00] I believe that we should do these
[47:02] things?
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Do I believe we should do these things?
[47:05] I do believe it.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; But I cannot do them without him. And
[47:09] the test is when if I were to do him, he
[47:11] he would look at that piece of gold and
[47:13] he would go, "No, I see too much of you
[47:16] in that piece of gold. I see you trying
[47:18] to be a Christian. You trying to be a
[47:20] believer. You trying to get yourself
[47:22] healed. You trying to get yourself
[47:24] saved. You trying to get yourself to
[47:26] church." And uh I'm sorry. I'm just
[47:29] gonna have to keep beating on that. So,
[47:31] &gt;&gt; and and see, the test does not make you
[47:33] bad or good. It just reveals who you
[47:36] are,
[47:36] &gt;&gt; right? that the the the test or the
[47:38] trial does not place something inside of
[47:41] you.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; It just reveals what is inside of you
[47:44] already.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; You know, a test in school, I know this
[47:47] is so basic, but let's just stay, can we
[47:48] just say basic? The test in school is
[47:51] not for the learning.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; The test in school is to see if you
[47:55] learned the days before, the hours
[47:58] before, the weeks before. And the test
[48:00] is the is the revealing. Did you pay
[48:03] attention in class? Anybody else not pay
[48:05] attention in class? and then try to
[48:06] study right before the test. Sometimes
[48:08] you luck out and you go through it. But
[48:10] you do that consistently over time, it
[48:12] will show that you're not It will show
[48:16] that I'm a Christian Sunday morning
[48:18] right before I come to church and maybe
[48:21] sometimes on a Wednesday night if I
[48:23] don't have anything else going on, but
[48:24] it will show that I'm not studying in
[48:26] the word the rest of those days.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I might get lucky,
[48:30] &gt;&gt; right,
[48:31] &gt;&gt; and get something right every once in a
[48:32] while. This is not to to admonish you.
[48:36] This is to admonish me for that. So he's
[48:39] what he's doing is he's molding his
[48:42] characteristics
[48:44] &gt;&gt; into the gold. Okay, that's what the
[48:45] that's what the beating is. He inspects
[48:47] it. That's the test. This to me is a map
[48:51] &gt;&gt; of of this is not I just want to say
[48:54] this. This is not a list of rules.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, if you look at this as a list
[49:01] of laws and rules, you will be
[49:04] overwhelmed.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Correct?
[49:06] &gt;&gt; You will, first of all, you won't be
[49:07] able to follow it. So, then, as Steve
[49:09] preached a few weeks ago, you'll go,
[49:10] "Well, what's the point of even trying?
[49:12] I can't do number three or number five
[49:15] or whatever it is. Uh, why am I even
[49:17] going to church?"
[49:18] &gt;&gt; In fact, I think sometimes that's why I
[49:21] or maybe others, and I won't speak for
[49:23] you, has sometimes have a little bit of
[49:24] trouble even getting into the word of
[49:26] God. Sometimes it's difficult to put on
[49:28] a tape because sometimes when you hear
[49:30] the tape, it sets a standard that you
[49:33] think you now need to meet. And if that
[49:35] pressure is too high, it's just easier
[49:37] sometimes to not listen to the tape.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm preaching anybody
[49:42] else, but I know for myself, I'll go,
[49:44] "Man, I really want to listen to a
[49:45] tape." And then there's something
[49:47] sometimes that fights. Yeah, but you're
[49:49] not really going to you're not you're
[49:52] struggling with what the tape is saying
[49:54] to do. And so then the temptation is,
[49:57] well, I'll just not listen to it.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; I That's just how the devil works on me.
[50:03] But but every time I put on the tape, of
[50:05] course, I find things that I'm not
[50:07] doing. But then he makes the way of
[50:09] escape. If I listen long enough, if I
[50:12] stay in it long enough, he says, I I
[50:15] almost every message will say, "Now
[50:16] listen, you can't do this. You can't do
[50:19] this. I got to be doing this." And so,
[50:22] but you got to hang with the word long
[50:24] enough
[50:25] &gt;&gt; to let the word help you
[50:27] &gt;&gt; fulfill the word.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; So simple, right? And yet, man, I don't
[50:32] know how many times I go I start a tape
[50:33] and I'm just like, I don't know if this
[50:35] is the right one or sometimes I don't
[50:36] even get to start it because it's too
[50:38] easy. It's just easier to be distracted
[50:40] by something else. So, this is this is
[50:41] not a law. This is not a set of
[50:43] instructions. This is a map of how to
[50:45] find God.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; You say a map, what do you say a map?
[50:49] This is like, you know, be be kind to
[50:51] one another. Uh pray for the man, he'll
[50:54] be saved. The brother's a little bit
[50:55] wrong. You know, stay. I'm not trying to
[50:57] mock it, but this is like, no, certainly
[50:59] it's deeper than this.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Well, go and try this first, and then if
[51:03] you can do this 100%, then we'll move on
[51:05] to the deeper things. But like this is
[51:08] what
[51:09] &gt;&gt; this is what I struggle with.
[51:12] I could understand a lot of things that
[51:14] are preached that are that are what we
[51:16] would call deep, but I don't have to
[51:18] live those things
[51:20] &gt;&gt; when it's real plain and it's real
[51:22] simple right in front of you and you got
[51:24] to go live it.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham preached a message
[51:27] several times why we struggle to live a
[51:30] Christian life or why is it so hard to
[51:32] live a Christian life and you you listen
[51:34] to that message. He's not going deep
[51:35] into uh these these mysteries and all
[51:38] these things. He's just laying it out
[51:39] plain how the way we should lead. I I
[51:40] got to keep moving forward. But but the
[51:42] reason why it's a map is um and I just I
[51:45] kind of want to just kind of shift or or
[51:47] focus shift this focus to something. The
[51:49] reason why it's a map to find him is
[51:51] because God as has always hidden
[51:55] himself.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; He's always hidden himself
[52:01] &gt;&gt; since the very beginning. He's hidden
[52:03] himself and is only seen and only viewed
[52:07] and only recognized by the true believer
[52:10] of that time.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Okay, that should be a real easy
[52:13] statement to grasp. But let's break that
[52:15] down a little bit. He's he he hides
[52:17] himself. You know, there was a time
[52:18] where God hid himself in a cloud
[52:22] &gt;&gt; and a pillar of fire,
[52:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:25] &gt;&gt; He hid himself in there. Now, you had to
[52:27] believe that this cloud that was
[52:29] floating outside of your tent if you
[52:31] were an Israelite was God.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I mean, it's a
[52:36] pillar of fire floating in the air.
[52:37] Like, how would I not believe that?" And
[52:39] yet, only two people out of two million
[52:42] &gt;&gt; crossed over into the promised land. The
[52:44] pillar, God himself, the creator of the
[52:46] universe, led the children of Israel in
[52:49] a pillar of fire
[52:52] &gt;&gt; and they didn't recognize him.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Correct. I find that like because we
[52:58] would say, "Well, if I was there,
[53:01] [laughter] I'm sure I'd be going over
[53:03] the I'd be there." But but we have the
[53:05] same God
[53:07] &gt;&gt; hidden in a pillar of fire. And how many
[53:10] are crossing over into the promised
[53:11] land,
[53:13] &gt;&gt; right? Because it takes recognition. It
[53:15] It takes recognition. So he was only
[53:17] visible for those who were looking for
[53:19] him. It's it's really simple. But even
[53:21] with God, there is a pillar of fire and
[53:23] a cloud by day. There were murmurings.
[53:25] There were rebellion. There were people
[53:27] worshiping idols. And God is literally
[53:29] in their midst.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Like a physically visible being still
[53:36] turning to idols, still doing all these
[53:38] things.
[53:40] Um,
[53:42] many were called out of Egypt. So they
[53:45] listened to the word. They listened to
[53:48] the message of their day. enough to be
[53:51] called out of Egypt, but not enough to
[53:54] go into the promised land.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; So, the word of God for their day, they
[54:00] agreed with. They thought it was the
[54:03] word. They said it was the word, but for
[54:06] some reason, there was a disconnect when
[54:08] the word said, "You're going to go do
[54:10] this."
[54:12] They either didn't understand what it
[54:14] said to do or what it said to do was too
[54:18] hard or they thought they had to do it.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; See, because God and God was just hiding
[54:26] himself. He was hiding himself. This is
[54:28] real basic, right? I know this is like
[54:30] not an amen like sermon, but it's just
[54:32] real basic. But God is hiding him. I'm
[54:34] not saying that to get amens, but it's
[54:35] it's like but it worked. But uh he's
[54:39] he's hiding himself, right? Job said, "I
[54:41] want to talk to you, God. I want to talk
[54:43] to you." And you know how he hid himself
[54:44] in a whirlwind.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; See, God, what he did is he's just like,
[54:47] "Okay, I'm going to come, but I'm going
[54:49] to hide myself in a source." And what
[54:51] this what this is going to do, it's
[54:53] really going to reveal to me when I look
[54:55] in the gold if you really want to find
[54:58] me. Do you really want to find me? He
[55:02] puts you and I through the trial to see
[55:05] will you really seek me out or will you
[55:07] try to figure your way out of the trial?
[55:10] And if you try to figure your way out
[55:11] the trial like the test, you might get
[55:13] out of it sometimes, but you're going to
[55:15] get in a deeper trial. You're going to
[55:16] get in a harder test. Not because he's
[55:19] cruel or because he's mean, because the
[55:21] answer is him.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; The answer isn't what I know and and all
[55:25] the things that I know. Uh the the the
[55:27] people the people um you know, he he
[55:29] changed his mask again. He came unto his
[55:31] own.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And they received him
[55:34] not." Now, I just want to start. Now, I
[55:36] I read this about the Pharisees and you
[55:38] know, it's real easy to beat up on the
[55:40] Pharisees, right?
[55:42] &gt;&gt; It's like like they're not here to
[55:44] defend themsel
[55:46] and you know, you read through the Bible
[55:47] and you're like, "These are kind of
[55:48] awful pe you know, they were like Jesus
[55:50] himself didn't like speak real highly of
[55:52] them, but I bet you if you knew them,
[55:54] they were probably good people."
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Is that kind of hard to grasp? I bet you
[56:00] they were good, faithful,
[56:04] churchgoing
[56:05] people.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Who said the word is true, the Bible,
[56:11] what they had for their day is true. And
[56:14] yet they were missing something.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; And he came unto his own. And the Bible
[56:18] says his own received not. They were
[56:19] good people. But they were looking for
[56:23] him to come like he came to Moses.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; See, they had the Bible. They had, can I
[56:29] just want to say this? They had the
[56:31] message of their hour.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; They had the message of their hour,
[56:35] which was all of the recordings up until
[56:37] that time, just like we say that we have
[56:40] now. All the recordings, they had the
[56:42] message of their hour and they read it.
[56:45] If they had tapes, we could have said
[56:46] they would have listened to those tapes,
[56:48] right? But they weren't finding him
[56:51] &gt;&gt; because they were trying to say, "How
[56:54] can I
[56:55] live what this message is saying based
[56:58] upon my own deeds and my own works and
[57:01] my own actions? How can I be holy enough
[57:04] to do this?"
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And um you know, they were looking for
[57:08] him to come like he came to Abraham or
[57:10] came to Samson. They're looking for God
[57:11] because they can look back. Listen, this
[57:14] this is foreshadowing. they can look
[57:16] back and see how he came
[57:19] &gt;&gt; and then they're looking for him to come
[57:20] the same way.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; So, we'll move to modern day because I I
[57:24] know you know where I'm going and I
[57:25] don't know if you think that this has to
[57:27] do with the word to the church, but let
[57:28] me tell you what the Pharisees and the
[57:30] people of Israel were studying. They
[57:32] were studying a word to the church
[57:34] &gt;&gt; for their day.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Like, we're not the only ones that got a
[57:37] couple of paragraphs. They had a word to
[57:40] the church for their day and they read
[57:43] it up and down and back and forth and to
[57:46] the best of their ability they tried to
[57:49] live it.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; That is true.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; He came um I think that brother Brandham
[57:54] says he came in the name of three sons.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Correct?
[57:57] &gt;&gt; He came in the name of the son of man,
[58:00] &gt;&gt; the son of God, and the son of David.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Right? Those are if you're taking notes,
[58:06] you can write that down but pretty easy
[58:07] to remember. He came to them to Israel
[58:10] as son of man. And he said, brother Ram
[58:13] says this was to fill Deuteronomy 18:15
[58:16] when he says the Lord uh your God shall
[58:19] raise up a prophet like unto me. And he
[58:22] said that prophet is a capital P and he
[58:23] says son of man is that prophet. That's
[58:26] what it means. Brother Bram goes on to
[58:28] say he never called himself son of God.
[58:31] He said, "Son of man on intentionally."
[58:34] &gt;&gt; And and we know that we we also know
[58:36] that the message says he come he came to
[58:40] the church.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; He came
[58:44] Anybody know it? I don't I don't want to
[58:46] I don't want anybody to get it wrong. He
[58:47] came to the church. He came in the
[58:50] church. And he comes with the church. To
[58:55] in with
[58:57] Okay, that's that's right. That's right.
[59:00] in the message, but they didn't
[59:02] recognize him because he was not the way
[59:04] that he came was not in their Bible.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; See, what they had failed to do is they
[59:10] had failed to include
[59:13] the prophetic message back then for
[59:16] their day to know what the Bible was
[59:20] talking about, the Bible for their day.
[59:22] They did not have a prophetic. They had
[59:25] it, but they did not listen to it. They
[59:28] did not eat it. They did not consume it.
[59:30] They did not say, "Listen, we have our
[59:32] scrolls. We have the law of Moses. We
[59:34] have these things. However, we have
[59:36] Isaiah and we have Elijah. We have these
[59:39] that are talking about this. I'm going
[59:40] to go in there and I'm going to read."
[59:42] And and maybe somebody said, "Yes, but
[59:44] those men were flawed men.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Maybe you should just preach out of the
[59:48] Bible."
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Does that sound familiar?
[59:53] &gt;&gt; May you know what? I I It's good to have
[59:55] a prophet. It's good to have a message
[59:57] of the hour, but why don't you just
[59:59] preach a good Bible message?
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Now, do you think I'm against the Bible?
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; You are. We're not going to make it
[1:00:07] without the Bible. I believe in Bible
[1:00:09] teaching. I believe in reading your
[1:00:11] Bible. I believe in taking it right out
[1:00:13] of the Bible. But there's something with
[1:00:15] the spirit
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; of saying, "Listen, I just want to have
[1:00:20] a Bible sermon because God, if he does
[1:00:23] it one way,
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; he's going to do it that same way." And
[1:00:27] God chose for his purposes to say,
[1:00:29] "Look, I'm going to give you a Bible and
[1:00:31] then I'm going to speak to a prophet
[1:00:33] who's going to bring a an interpretation
[1:00:36] of that Bible
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; and he's going to speak it to you.
[1:00:38] However, the interpretation is going to
[1:00:41] come real to you when I bring it to
[1:00:43] pass."
[1:00:44] But you're not going to know I brought
[1:00:45] it to pass if you're not reading what
[1:00:47] the prophet said. In fact, I'll bring it
[1:00:50] to pass right in front of you and you'll
[1:00:51] call me Beelzebub.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; That's what happened. They called him
[1:00:57] Beelzeub although he was doing what the
[1:01:00] Bible said he was going to do because
[1:01:02] they failed to look at it through a
[1:01:04] prophetic message. And I know you know
[1:01:06] where I'm going.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, I just want to keep moving
[1:01:09] forward. Um, time wise, I think I'm
[1:01:11] good. All right. I I I I last time and
[1:01:14] this I I I uh I wish brother Donald was
[1:01:17] here because he kept my piece of paper
[1:01:18] from last time but like um I Okay, I
[1:01:21] have a piece of paper. This is why the
[1:01:23] message of the hour, this is why the
[1:01:26] word of God, let me put it that way, is
[1:01:28] so perfect.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; And this is why you can have confidence
[1:01:31] and you can really have faith in
[1:01:33] something. Because last time I was
[1:01:35] telling you, well, this is a piece of
[1:01:36] paper and this is your promise. This is
[1:01:38] your token
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; and this promise is enough to defeat the
[1:01:42] devil. And I still believe that. But I
[1:01:44] but but I didn't have time. And now I
[1:01:45] got some time. I want to tell you why.
[1:01:47] And you as soon as I say it, you're
[1:01:48] going to be like, I know what you're
[1:01:49] going to do. But I'll tell you why that
[1:01:51] promise is so powerful. Because this is
[1:01:54] what he did.
[1:02:04] There you go.
[1:02:07] Now it cannot be replicated.
[1:02:11] It cannot be duplicated.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; It cannot be imitated. It cannot be
[1:02:15] faked.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Only this piece of paper fits with that
[1:02:21] piece of paper.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; And if I have this piece of paper, if I
[1:02:26] have this half of the promise and God
[1:02:28] has that half of the promise, I cannot
[1:02:33] fail. Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; They say, "Okay, that that really that
[1:02:37] was the big but but see that's what the
[1:02:41] difference between just reading your
[1:02:43] Bible,
[1:02:44] just reading your Bible." That's a big
[1:02:46] thing. But just there's, you know,
[1:02:48] there's millions of people that read
[1:02:49] their Bible.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; There's millions of people are going to
[1:02:52] be lost and go to hell.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; You know, there's millions of people
[1:02:55] that listen to the message of the hour,
[1:02:57] William Brandham, that will be lost and
[1:02:59] I don't know where they're going to go,
[1:03:01] but there's they're not going to be
[1:03:02] bride. There's millions of people.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they have this, but they
[1:03:08] have the whole thing.
[1:03:10] They have the whole thing. Their
[1:03:11] covenant they've made with themsel, what
[1:03:13] they can do, what they can produce, what
[1:03:16] they can believe, what they can do. And
[1:03:17] God doesn't have a place in it.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they he's hidden.
[1:03:21] He's hidden to them. And they think that
[1:03:24] they're doing God a great service.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; And it's going to be a sad it's going to
[1:03:29] be a sad day. I do not want to be in
[1:03:31] that particular situation.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; And and he said that the word for the
[1:03:35] day would come, but it's not going to
[1:03:36] come through man's interpretation.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; He interpreted the word for the day by
[1:03:40] bringing it to pass. Amen. Let listen.
[1:03:45] Only those that do have the Bible and
[1:03:48] have the message of the hour for their
[1:03:50] hour and also are putting those two
[1:03:53] things together under the leadership and
[1:03:57] the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:59] Because see, it takes another element.
[1:04:01] You can have those things, but you have
[1:04:03] to find where God is hidden for that
[1:04:05] day.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; You have to find where he's hidden. And
[1:04:08] he's only going to reveal himself to
[1:04:11] those who are looking for him.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; In the way he wants to be found, not in
[1:04:16] the way you want to find him. And I want
[1:04:18] to find him. Lord, I need you to show me
[1:04:21] where you're at in this because through
[1:04:23] my understanding, I think it's this, but
[1:04:26] I know where my understanding leads.
[1:04:29] I can't rely on that. I have a whole
[1:04:31] Bible full of examples of people who
[1:04:33] leaned into their own understanding
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; of what the message because that's the
[1:04:37] other thing too is like the message in
[1:04:39] the Bible it gets so t it gets it's made
[1:04:42] complicated. Can I just say I hope this
[1:04:44] isn't offensive. There are many many
[1:04:47] people who complicate
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; the message.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; They complicate the Bible. Preachers do
[1:04:54] it. Churches do it. Uh uh whole groups
[1:04:57] do it. Individuals do it. I I think
[1:04:59] preachers do it because then you need
[1:05:00] them to explain it to you.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to be frank.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; They complicate it. It turns into this
[1:05:06] thing where you're like, "Uh, okay. I'm
[1:05:09] not sure what you just said." Okay.
[1:05:10] Well, let me let me explain that to you.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; That's not That's not what the Bible
[1:05:15] says. The word came unto the common man.
[1:05:18] He heard it gladly.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. The thing is that we as in
[1:05:22] humans, as in people, we've complicated
[1:05:25] the message. And then people hear it and
[1:05:28] they go, I don't believe that. Well,
[1:05:29] they shouldn't believe it because I
[1:05:31] complicated to something that the word
[1:05:33] never said,
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; whether with good intentions or bad
[1:05:36] intentions or whatever might it it comes
[1:05:38] back to just what does the word say?
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; And do I believe it? Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Um, so there are many church members,
[1:05:45] churchgoers, and listen, they were
[1:05:48] looking for him to come like he came
[1:05:50] with Moses, but he came as son of man.
[1:05:53] He came to them. So when the Bible says
[1:05:56] he came to his own, they received him
[1:05:59] not because they were expecting a cloud.
[1:06:01] They're expecting a pillar of fire,
[1:06:02] they're expecting a whirlwind, they were
[1:06:04] expecting a general to ride in all the
[1:06:06] ways that they thought that was going to
[1:06:07] happen, right? Because and in the day,
[1:06:09] they had a word to the church. I I know
[1:06:11] I'm repeating that, but it's but it's
[1:06:12] important. They they had a word to the
[1:06:14] church like we have and they still
[1:06:16] missed him.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; They missed him. So us having this piece
[1:06:20] of paper is good, but you can still miss
[1:06:23] him.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; And then after he was crucified and he
[1:06:26] was buried and he resurrected, he made
[1:06:28] another covenant with the believer.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; You know that?
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; He made another covenant with a
[1:06:33] believer. William, he made a covenant.
[1:06:34] And you know what he did? He tore his
[1:06:37] son in half.
[1:06:40] He tore his own son and tore him in half
[1:06:43] and he took his body
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; and he gave you his spirit.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; The other piece of paper that you have
[1:06:50] is the match for Jesus who he took his
[1:06:54] body. We don't have that. And what did
[1:06:56] Jesus even say? He goes, "Look, I am
[1:06:57] going to go unto the father
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; and you're not going to see me. The
[1:07:01] world's not going to see me and yet you
[1:07:04] will
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; because I'll be in you." See, I'm going
[1:07:06] to tear. He made a new covenant. That's
[1:07:08] the confidence that I can have is that I
[1:07:10] have I have a lot of faults. I have a
[1:07:13] lot of mistakes. I make them every
[1:07:15] single day. But I have the half of the
[1:07:18] covenant that he gave me. Not because I
[1:07:21] deserve it. Not because I'm good.
[1:07:23] Because he decided, listen, it would be
[1:07:26] one thing that if he just died for me,
[1:07:29] it would already be the greatest thing
[1:07:31] to ever happen on the face of the earth.
[1:07:33] It would be the greatest event if God
[1:07:35] said, "Listen, I am going to change my
[1:07:38] form. I'm going to hide myself
[1:07:40] throughout the ages and I'm going to
[1:07:41] come and I'm going to hide in a sinful
[1:07:45] flesh body
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; so that I can understand you better, so
[1:07:49] that I can know you better, so I can
[1:07:50] enter in for you." That would be
[1:07:52] incredible if that's all he did was to
[1:07:54] say, "William, I'm going to give you
[1:07:56] that half so that and I'm going to come
[1:07:58] and I'm going to be one of you so I'll
[1:07:59] understand you." But that's not all he
[1:08:01] did. He said, "I am going to become you
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; so that you can become me."
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; That to me is like that's what makes him
[1:08:11] God to me.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just say, "Let me come down
[1:08:14] and understand." No, no, no. Listen, I'm
[1:08:16] going to hide myself in you and I'm
[1:08:20] going to hide you in me.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Wait a minute. So, I'm
[1:08:26] going to be hidden in the Lord." Like,
[1:08:27] wait a minute. I still have all these
[1:08:28] things that I'm dealing with. Yeah,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; let him take care of those things. See,
[1:08:32] all that becomes is a set of rules, a
[1:08:35] set of Now, do I believe that we should
[1:08:37] do I believe in a standard. I believe in
[1:08:39] a standard, right?
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Because what some people do is they go,
[1:08:42] "Okay, well, I'm going to break off the
[1:08:43] traditions. I'm going to break the
[1:08:44] traditions." So, well, the pastor is
[1:08:46] saying go to church, so I'm just not
[1:08:47] going to go to church.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; It's okay. I mean, it's Wednesday.
[1:08:52] Everybody's here. So, it
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go to church because
[1:08:56] Well, let me show you these quotes where
[1:08:58] you can go to church. I absolutely
[1:08:59] believe you can go to church every
[1:09:00] single day and you can be lost and go to
[1:09:02] hell.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Can we just get that out of the way
[1:09:04] right now? You can read your Bible every
[1:09:06] day. You can pray every day. You can
[1:09:08] come to every church service and never
[1:09:10] miss it. And that does not make you a
[1:09:12] Christian.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; But listen, if you are a Christian,
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; you'll want to do those things. I'm
[1:09:18] going to read you a quote if it's okay.
[1:09:19] I I actually didn't plan on reading it,
[1:09:20] but I haven't noted. People say um I I'm
[1:09:24] going to stop real quick. Brother Steve,
[1:09:25] I love that scripture that you read. He
[1:09:27] said there's a famine in the land.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; There's a famine in the land for what?
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; The hearing of the word of God.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham goes on to
[1:09:38] explain, you know, there's the preaching
[1:09:39] of the word of God's not being preached.
[1:09:41] And then he'll say, but it's being
[1:09:43] preached and some people are not
[1:09:44] listening to it. See, the famine is not
[1:09:46] always that the word of God is not being
[1:09:48] preached. It's that we don't want to
[1:09:50] hear it.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; It's a reverse famine. He says this,
[1:09:54] "People say I can stay at home and you
[1:09:56] can not you can not like me for this,
[1:09:57] but this applies to me. So, I could stay
[1:10:00] at home and be just as good a Christian
[1:10:02] as I can at church. You can't."
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; That's his words. And you can say,
[1:10:07] "Well,
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; well,
[1:10:10] that's 1950s. That's 1960s. What about
[1:10:12] 2025?"
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible says not forsake assembling
[1:10:17] ourselves together and that much more as
[1:10:19] we see the time coming. If you're a
[1:10:21] Christian, big question there. If you're
[1:10:24] a Christian, you long to go where other
[1:10:26] Christians are. Is it an individual
[1:10:29] walk? Yes. That's why coming into this
[1:10:31] building does not get you
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; into heaven.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; But if I have him and brother Kurt, you
[1:10:37] have him. I want to be this spirit wants
[1:10:41] to be with that spirit because guess
[1:10:43] what, brother Kurt is that piece right
[1:10:45] there. Amen.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Jerry, you're that piece right there.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Who else? Who wants to be a peace?
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Sister Kathy, you're that piece right
[1:10:55] there. So, if I come together, if I come
[1:10:57] together and and we all get together and
[1:10:59] and Sister Kathy's not there, that's
[1:11:01] what that that's what that looks like
[1:11:02] because it doesn't have that. Well, I'm
[1:11:04] not that important. It's not that it
[1:11:05] doesn't matter if I don't come. It
[1:11:06] matters.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; It matters because a covenant was given
[1:11:09] to believers.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; And and listen, I don't want to be
[1:11:13] holding you back. Right?
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to be an expectation
[1:11:16] and I'm over here like, "Well, I'll just
[1:11:18] keep my little piece of paper. It's it's
[1:11:19] it's this big. I don't really do
[1:11:21] anything in the church." It's incomplete
[1:11:23] without that little piece of paper.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; It's incomplete.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; He says, "If you're a Christian, you
[1:11:29] long to go where other Christians are
[1:11:31] and fellowship with other Christians.
[1:11:33] So, you cannot stay away from church and
[1:11:35] live the same life. You can't do it
[1:11:39] because it's like, "I'm hungry, but I'll
[1:11:43] never go to a table.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Talk about a famine for hearing the word
[1:11:49] of God. I'm hungry, but I'll never go to
[1:11:51] a table.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; I'll just I'll never eat. I just I ain't
[1:11:54] going to do it." See, you've got to go
[1:11:56] and feed on the word of God and
[1:11:59] fellowship with one another. We need one
[1:12:01] another now more than we ever did need
[1:12:03] each other is now. when you get yourself
[1:12:06] singled out from the rest of the group.
[1:12:07] Now listen, sometime I'm just going to
[1:12:09] pause this right here. Sometimes people
[1:12:11] single you out and then sometimes you
[1:12:13] single yourself out. I've been guilty. I
[1:12:15] I've had both happen. Sometimes I'm
[1:12:17] like, "Well, they didn't include me."
[1:12:19] But then sometimes I'm like, "Well, I
[1:12:20] didn't feel included."
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; And there was invitations. There was,
[1:12:24] "Why didn't I invite? Why didn't I make
[1:12:26] those steps? Well, they didn't come."
[1:12:28] Well, do it again.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Draw the circle bigger. Right? But
[1:12:32] you'll single yourself out or sometimes
[1:12:34] you get singled out. Neither is a good
[1:12:35] excuse. It's just neither is a good
[1:12:37] excuse. Singled out from the rest of You
[1:12:38] know why? Because this is this isn't a
[1:12:40] this isn't a a bed of roses.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; It's not a bed of roses.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Go play a competitive sport or
[1:12:47] competitive game or a race and what if
[1:12:49] somebody was like, "I'm going to destroy
[1:12:50] you out there." Well, I guess I'll just
[1:12:51] take my bike and go home.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Right. That What kind of competitive
[1:12:56] sport would that be? Oh, you're going to
[1:12:57] try to Okay. Well, no. I'm sorry. I'm
[1:12:59] going to I'm going to come anyways.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. and I don't bring my agame.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; And we do that with sports or we do that
[1:13:05] with whatever it is, work or whatever it
[1:13:06] is. How much more the house of God?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Uh you sing single yourself out from the
[1:13:12] rest of them. Making yourself a little
[1:13:14] bit different.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; You don't want [clears throat] to
[1:13:17] associate with them because they believe
[1:13:19] this and don't want to associate with
[1:13:20] that. You're getting on dangerous ground
[1:13:22] right then. Keeping away from church.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Find the one of your choice.
[1:13:27] Oh, that's that's pretty nice,
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; right? It doesn't force you to go to
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; you got to go to Flagstaff Tabernacle.
[1:13:33] Find the one of your choice
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; and remain there and be a Christian
[1:13:38] brother to all of them. That's the way
[1:13:39] to be a real
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Christian. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; All right. I'm uh 8:00. I've been 30
[1:13:45] minutes. Can I have a few more minutes?
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; I know we got a baptism. So, I'm uh
[1:13:51] I'm gonna hurry and I'm not I hope you
[1:13:52] don't feel like I'm like raking you over
[1:13:54] the coals. I feel like as soon as I'm
[1:13:55] reading this, I'm like, the Lord's just
[1:13:57] like, Mhm. got that hammer out. You got
[1:14:01] some rough edges. You got some sharp
[1:14:02] edges. You got some lumps in there.
[1:14:06] Um, so he's crucified. He makes a new He
[1:14:08] makes a new covenant.
[1:14:11] Jesus giving another word to the church
[1:14:13] that he would be hiding himself.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; So he's telling you
[1:14:17] and in order to recognize him, there
[1:14:19] needs to be an increase of one part and
[1:14:21] there needs to be de a decrease of
[1:14:23] another part. Right. Yes.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; He be the second thing he came as a son
[1:14:27] of God. And he says now he says in the
[1:14:29] scripture I was going to read it at the
[1:14:30] beginning. Behold you are sons of God
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; now.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; You are sons of God now.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; So right there you can just take the the
[1:14:41] battle that the devil says. Oh keep
[1:14:43] working on getting to that son of God
[1:14:45] stage. The the the Bible says if we want
[1:14:48] to take the Bible and have a good Bible
[1:14:50] teaching.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Now you are the sons of God
[1:14:54] and it does not even appear what you
[1:14:55] shall be. So you are that now. But the
[1:14:58] problem is here's the problem. If you
[1:15:00] don't recognize who God is, you won't
[1:15:02] recognize who you are.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; See the the the the problem just
[1:15:06] compounds. If I'm not recognizing where
[1:15:08] he's hid,
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; I don't even know who I am. And then I
[1:15:11] can treat myself and act like I want to
[1:15:14] and live any way I want to. Because
[1:15:16] really what I would be doing if I
[1:15:17] recognized who I am, I would never want
[1:15:20] to dirty what God has cleaned,
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; right? I would never want to take
[1:15:25] Listen, if you recognized who you were,
[1:15:28] that you are worth more than the blood
[1:15:30] of the son of God, would you want to go
[1:15:33] out and tarnish that? Would you want to
[1:15:35] go out and dirty that? Would you want to
[1:15:36] go and have your way with what God paid
[1:15:39] for? And I know we know these things,
[1:15:41] but do we recognize them? That's
[1:15:44] different. You could say, here's the
[1:15:46] thing is, you know, this is a weird
[1:15:49] example, but like we know who a actor
[1:15:51] is, a famous actor, actress or
[1:15:52] politician, but if you pass them, you
[1:15:54] could pass them on the street and not
[1:15:56] recognize them,
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; but yet you know who they are,
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; You know who they are. It's that same
[1:16:01] thing. It's like we know what the
[1:16:03] believer is supposed to be, but do do
[1:16:05] you recognize a believer when you look
[1:16:08] at yourself in the mirror? Very good.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; And if you can't recognize a believer,
[1:16:14] are you really recognizing God in this
[1:16:16] day and where he's hidden him?
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; See, he took I I I went over that. So,
[1:16:20] and to think of that, he changed his
[1:16:22] mask again. He He changes his mask down
[1:16:26] through the ages. And And I love this.
[1:16:28] He set aside his robe and his crown.
[1:16:31] Yeah.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; He set aside his robe and his crown and
[1:16:36] his throne
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; to sleep on the side of the road,
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; to sleep in the ditch, to stay in the
[1:16:42] woods, to be poor, to be all these
[1:16:45] things, and to taste death, and to take
[1:16:48] the penalty of death upon him. That's
[1:16:49] that's where he hid himself. They
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; to me, that's just the most amazing
[1:16:54] thing. He hid himself in that. And if
[1:16:55] that wasn't enough
[1:16:57] that he would elevate me to his throne
[1:17:00] and to his crown and to the robe that he
[1:17:02] left.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; We should just stop there
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; and think about that for like a year
[1:17:09] without saying anything, without
[1:17:12] speaking, without doing anything and
[1:17:14] think about
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; how much you mean to him.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. If all you have is that and you
[1:17:23] don't have another word, that should be
[1:17:25] enough for you to say, "Lord, what do
[1:17:27] you want me to do?"
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, how do you want me to live? Lord,
[1:17:31] how can I please you today because of
[1:17:33] what you've done for me?
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; But you have to realize that these that
[1:17:43] he's hidden in plain sight. See, it's
[1:17:47] like a
[1:17:50] This is what happens sometimes. Um I'm
[1:17:52] trying to I'm trying to rush, brother
[1:17:53] Steve. So this is what happens sometimes
[1:17:55] is when we when we sometimes when we
[1:17:58] hear, well, God is going to hide himself
[1:18:00] and then he's going to reveal himself
[1:18:01] and he's going to hide himself. The same
[1:18:03] thing happens when you read this piece
[1:18:04] of paper sometimes and you go, I'm lost.
[1:18:07] Like I this is so complicated that what
[1:18:09] do you mean? He hid himself again. So
[1:18:11] like where do I have to go find him? And
[1:18:12] then it becomes overwhelming. It becomes
[1:18:15] intimidating. But see, when he hides
[1:18:17] himself, he gets simpler
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; and simpler and simpler each time. Not
[1:18:23] more complicated.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; But because I'm looking for complicated,
[1:18:28] I miss them. And this is going to be a
[1:18:29] weird analogy, but I was thinking of
[1:18:30] this earlier. You know, you could take
[1:18:32] flour and you know, you take a handful
[1:18:34] of flour and it looks pretty it looks
[1:18:37] pretty uh crushed up, right? But if
[1:18:39] you've ever baked anything or you ever
[1:18:41] take and run that flour through a
[1:18:42] filter,
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; right? You sift it, run it through a
[1:18:46] filter, and all of a sudden at the top
[1:18:48] of it is going all these clumps of flour
[1:18:50] that you never thought were in there.
[1:18:52] Harden pieces. Sometimes a rock,
[1:18:54] sometimes a bug, you know, depending on
[1:18:57] where you get your flour from. And what
[1:18:59] you're left with is this like, oh, this
[1:19:01] is good flour. And then he hides himself
[1:19:04] and he sifts it again.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; He does.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; And then it's a finer it's a finer
[1:19:10] filter that he puts on it.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; And and you know what? Some are left
[1:19:15] behind because they don't fit through
[1:19:16] the filter. Because they are too big
[1:19:19] with their own ideas and their own
[1:19:21] accomplishments of how they're going to
[1:19:22] live this and the filter catches them.
[1:19:25] And you know the remarkable I was
[1:19:27] thinking about that. You know the the
[1:19:29] little piece of flower that makes it
[1:19:30] through is the one that is the smallest.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. The one who has decreased the most
[1:19:37] in listen in will
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; in what you want to do in what you think
[1:19:43] is the right thing to do in and listen
[1:19:46] even in the way you think you should
[1:19:48] serve God has to be crushed and it has
[1:19:52] to be filtered out.
[1:19:55] Otherwise, you're trying to fulfill
[1:19:57] this. Even if you're just trying to
[1:19:58] fulfill that little piece and you give
[1:20:00] the rest to God, it won't work.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; It won't work. I kind of tore my paper
[1:20:03] up, so it's kind of hard to know what
[1:20:04] I'm talking about, but you know what I'm
[1:20:06] talking about.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; And it's And here's the thing is we can
[1:20:09] make the same mistake as the Pharisees
[1:20:11] made if we're looking for a God.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to go through this real
[1:20:15] quick. If you're looking for a God of
[1:20:17] 2,000 years ago, he's not that Jesus
[1:20:20] anymore.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; You say, "Shocking Jesus, wait, he's the
[1:20:24] same yesterday and today." No, no. His,
[1:20:26] Brother Brandham says his nature stays
[1:20:28] the same,
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; but his form changes. his mask changes.
[1:20:33] So, he's not that same God. See, the the
[1:20:35] the Pharisees were looking for the
[1:20:38] Messiah,
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; and they had their Bible and they had
[1:20:41] their word to the church,
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; but they failed to see him right in
[1:20:44] front. And many people struggle with
[1:20:47] living a Christian life today because
[1:20:49] they're either looking for a God of
[1:20:50] 2,000 years ago, let's just bring it
[1:20:52] home, or they're looking for a God of
[1:20:54] William Brandham.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Watch. Okay. because he's not here's
[1:21:02] here's you you listen to a tape or you
[1:21:04] hear a message and you see the miracles
[1:21:05] and you hear like when I hear them I I I
[1:21:08] like I can't listen to a tape without
[1:21:09] tearing up. I can't listen to a tape
[1:21:11] without getting chills,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; But if I say I want the God that's in
[1:21:18] that tape to come to me, I've missed it.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Because he's not son of God. He's our
[1:21:25] son of man. He's now son of God. He's
[1:21:27] not coming to you.
[1:21:29] He's coming in you.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; He's hidden in you. So if you're looking
[1:21:34] for this is why people struggle with the
[1:21:37] message because they're looking for the
[1:21:40] God of William Brham to come present to
[1:21:43] to them
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; and not realizing that he just showed
[1:21:48] you a preview of what God wants to do in
[1:21:51] your life. In you might be the only one.
[1:21:54] You might be a Joshua and a Caleb and
[1:21:56] there's two million believers. He wants
[1:21:58] to show you, listen, that was what it
[1:22:00] was like, but I but I've hidden myself
[1:22:02] now inside of flesh. And I know this is
[1:22:05] again, this is so basic, but yet people
[1:22:07] struggle with the message because when
[1:22:09] they start to look at God coming to them
[1:22:11] and he doesn't come to them in the way
[1:22:13] they think, they go, "Well, I mean,
[1:22:14] there's nothing to that. I don't know.
[1:22:16] He's kind of flawed. Well, I don't know.
[1:22:18] Maybe he was just maybe he's just like
[1:22:20] just like the Pharisees." Just like the
[1:22:22] Pharisees. And we we we throw a lot of
[1:22:23] shade at the Pharisees. There's a lot of
[1:22:26] that same that spirit hasn't left.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; That Pharisee is long dead and gone. But
[1:22:31] that spirit that there is still
[1:22:32] attacking you. It's still attacking me.
[1:22:35] He's not coming to man in this day. He's
[1:22:37] coming in man.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's yeah, okay, that
[1:22:41] makes sense. That's kind of basic." But
[1:22:43] it's not basic because he's hidden. And
[1:22:46] that's why uh listen, that's why
[1:22:48] traditions and routines do not reap the
[1:22:51] harvest that the word says should be
[1:22:54] reaped in this day because the tradition
[1:22:56] keeps him outside of the church. Not
[1:22:59] those doors,
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; this door.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; He's outside this door knocking on this
[1:23:04] door saying, "Hey, look, I want to show
[1:23:06] myself to you, but I can only do it in
[1:23:08] you. I am not going to clown for you. I
[1:23:11] am not going to say it's a wicked and
[1:23:13] adulterous generation that seeks out. If
[1:23:16] only the God of William Brandham would
[1:23:18] come here and perform that same miracle,
[1:23:20] I'll believe him. Doesn't that sound
[1:23:22] familiar? If you would just raised them
[1:23:24] from the dead, we'll believe you, Jesus.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; No, I'm sorry. You won't. You won't
[1:23:30] believe. If the God of William Brandham,
[1:23:32] Here's the thing is he has come and he
[1:23:34] has done things in our midst and
[1:23:36] sometimes we still find ourselves
[1:23:38] murmuring,
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; right? worshiping idols.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; We got a pillar of fire sometimes
[1:23:43] hanging right over us. Visible
[1:23:46] manifestations of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:23:48] yet sometimes I still find myself.
[1:23:50] [laughter] I still find myself murmuring
[1:23:52] and complaining. Oh, this light bread.
[1:23:54] Oh, mana again. Oh, quail again.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; It's a famine of hearing the word of
[1:24:02] God. Not a supply issue, an intake
[1:24:04] issue.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:06] Uh, I got to close. The woman at the
[1:24:09] well was uh was expecting to see him.
[1:24:15] That's why she saw him. She said, you
[1:24:18] know, he started to have this
[1:24:19] conversation with her and she said,
[1:24:22] "Sir,
[1:24:24] I perceive that you are a prophet." You
[1:24:27] know, when Messiah comes,
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; where did she get that information?
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; You know what she was? She was in the
[1:24:35] word.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; She was in the word every single day.
[1:24:39] She was in the word. And she didn't say,
[1:24:41] "You got to come this way. You gotta
[1:24:43] come right how I like it. How I
[1:24:45] understand it." She goes, "You know," at
[1:24:46] first she didn't even believe it. She's
[1:24:48] like, "Well, wait a minute." And then
[1:24:49] she goes, "However, when Messiah comes
[1:24:52] and then he showed himself to her, and
[1:24:53] she recognized it in a in a
[1:24:56] conversation, what what looks to be like
[1:24:57] a 10-minute conversation
[1:25:00] because she was looking for him in the
[1:25:01] way the word said that he was going to
[1:25:03] come. That's what recognized. Can I read
[1:25:05] this quote? And then I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:25:06] shut it down. But alas, the traditions
[1:25:09] of the church fathers in that day had by
[1:25:12] their tra traditions veiled the true
[1:25:14] mercy seat from the people.
[1:25:17] Just like the scripture read, oh well he
[1:25:19] says by your traditions you've t you
[1:25:21] made the word of none effect. By your
[1:25:23] traditions if they had knowed the
[1:25:25] scripture each piece would have come
[1:25:27] like the little Chinese tag. He's
[1:25:29] talking about the paper coming together.
[1:25:31] If they had known the scriptures, it
[1:25:33] would have fit together. If they had
[1:25:36] been taught the scripture, they would
[1:25:37] have seen the mercy seat. Listen, it's
[1:25:39] not just about being taught the Bible
[1:25:41] from Genesis to Revelations. If if I'm
[1:25:45] just going to I'll just declare what I
[1:25:46] believe. If you cut out the message of
[1:25:48] the hour, you will not understand what's
[1:25:51] in those pages of the Bible.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; I just going to be this is not time to
[1:25:56] mess around and beat around the bush.
[1:25:57] And I think most of you probably agree
[1:25:59] with this, but it's but there's a spirit
[1:26:01] that is attacking every single one of us
[1:26:04] that says, "Okay, that's good. He was a
[1:26:06] good man. He was a prophet, a prophet of
[1:26:09] God, but go ahead and just stick with
[1:26:12] that Bible and you'll be good." And then
[1:26:14] you can go see Brother Brandham say,
[1:26:15] "Yeah, just stick with that Bible." And
[1:26:16] you're like, "See, he said it." But he
[1:26:19] said more than that.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; See, brother Brandham, William Brandon
[1:26:23] was saying, "Stick with that Bible." But
[1:26:24] when God came through and spoke, he
[1:26:26] said, "Now listen, let me show you how
[1:26:28] I'm hidden today.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Or do you want to just be a Pharisee
[1:26:31] believing that Bible?" And that's why
[1:26:33] it's such a it's such a line where the
[1:26:37] the deceived and the undeceived. It's a
[1:26:40] hair's line because they're going to
[1:26:42] believe the same Bible. And even maybe
[1:26:44] most of them will say, "The message is
[1:26:46] is good. It's true. I believe Isaiah the
[1:26:49] prophet, like the Pharisees, I believe."
[1:26:52] But they don't take what he says and mix
[1:26:55] it and then let the Lord have his way
[1:26:59] with the word. Amen.
[1:27:03] He was God suffer. I'm going to skip
[1:27:05] down men and women delegates to this con
[1:27:07] convention. I want to say this without
[1:27:09] respect of person in view of the today
[1:27:11] where we're here today. I'm afraid that
[1:27:13] traditions of the fathers, the church
[1:27:15] fathers has hid this from too many
[1:27:17] people.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Since the Holy Ghost has come in these
[1:27:21] last days as prophesied and the veil has
[1:27:23] been rent, too many people try to hang
[1:27:26] their traditions of the fathers. Too
[1:27:27] many people try to put a veil back, but
[1:27:30] the veil's been torn. But they try to
[1:27:32] put a veil back and go, "Okay, this is
[1:27:34] our ceremony. This is our routine. If
[1:27:36] you want to receive God, you have to
[1:27:37] come through here." And that's just
[1:27:38] churches. I talk about just like
[1:27:40] Catholic church and thing denomin
[1:27:42] churches. Hey, if you if you want the
[1:27:44] truth, you got to be hearing it from
[1:27:46] this pulpit, from this minister, from
[1:27:48] this thing. I'm sorry. I thought it was
[1:27:49] God that we were listening to.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; I I I I think some of the best
[1:27:54] correction and some of the best uh
[1:27:56] ministering to my heart that I've gotten
[1:27:58] has been from my kids or somebody else's
[1:28:00] children or somebody who just says a
[1:28:02] word to me and I'm like, "Huh?"
[1:28:05] If I'm looking for it, you see, if I'm
[1:28:08] looking for it,
[1:28:10] are you looking for it?
[1:28:14] Too many people try to hang their
[1:28:16] traditions of the fathers and that's why
[1:28:17] they can't see the extreme. I love it.
[1:28:20] The extreme joy and peace and things
[1:28:22] that the church has today. There's
[1:28:24] people that look over at somebody who's
[1:28:26] joyful and it's like, why is that person
[1:28:27] joyful?
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Why are they being Wait a minute. Why
[1:28:30] are they being so joyful? is because
[1:28:32] they've recognized something and you can
[1:28:35] recognize it too.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; It's in plain view of those who believe
[1:28:43] the traditions has made avail. So that's
[1:28:45] where the people try to blindfold so
[1:28:47] many people by their traditions and you
[1:28:48] fail to see why those people are so
[1:28:50] elated and so enthused and these these
[1:28:53] conventions are such so odd, such a
[1:28:56] strange thing because those people have
[1:28:59] broke through a barrier. And there's
[1:29:01] people that don't understand when
[1:29:02] somebody's broke through a barrier
[1:29:03] because they haven't broken through the
[1:29:05] barrier. And you can do one of two
[1:29:07] things. You can say,
[1:29:09] "I I don't need to break through that
[1:29:11] barrier.
[1:29:13] I I I know I have the Bible. I don't I'm
[1:29:15] not saying anybody I don't need that. I
[1:29:19] don't need that." Are you hanging up
[1:29:21] traditions?
[1:29:22] Is maybe the breakthrough not so that
[1:29:25] you can jump and scream and shout and
[1:29:27] those things, right? Because that could
[1:29:28] be imitated. But maybe the breakthrough
[1:29:29] is to get you and I out of control of
[1:29:33] things. Us trying to live this, us
[1:29:36] trying to live the message, live the
[1:29:38] Bible.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe those things just to break us out
[1:29:41] of when it looks like when you are in
[1:29:44] control.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; When I'm in control,
[1:29:47] because I, you know, I don't know about
[1:29:48] you, but I just I love to be in control.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:54] If we
[1:29:56] maybe I'm the only one, but I like being
[1:29:58] in control. I'm not saying I am in
[1:30:00] control, but I like to be I like to say
[1:30:03] that I am. You ask my family, they're
[1:30:05] like, "No,
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; I like to be in control of my emotions,
[1:30:08] what I say, what I think." But I'm not.
[1:30:12] But this seems to be the easiest place
[1:30:13] for me to be in control. And God's like,
[1:30:15] I I want to have control. Sometimes
[1:30:18] control looks like wildfire, and
[1:30:20] sometimes it looks like a hush.
[1:30:24] But it doesn't matter. It's when he's in
[1:30:25] control. And I know they're coming out
[1:30:27] here. So, uh, man, I had more, but I
[1:30:30] think we're going to have another It's
[1:30:32] hard to get that momentum back. Um, but
[1:30:35] I think because of the sake of time, I'm
[1:30:38] going to stop. It's been 45 minutes.
[1:30:41] Uh,
[1:30:45] man, I got like a whole wheelbarrow
[1:30:47] full.
[1:30:50] I think we'll close.
[1:30:53] If I if I read another one, it's it's
[1:30:55] going to get long and I'm gonna get in
[1:30:56] trouble. I think they're preparing for
[1:30:58] the baptism. Brother Tom, um would you
[1:31:01] mind coming? I don't know if they're It
[1:31:04] sounds like they may be in need of
[1:31:05] another minute. Would you mind just
[1:31:06] coming and and singing a few songs? I'm
[1:31:08] sorry that was probably so uh mixed up,
[1:31:11] but um I maybe we'll be able to continue
[1:31:14] this. I hope I could start off with a
[1:31:15] little bit of momentum, but maybe you're
[1:31:17] like, "What does that have to do with
[1:31:18] the word to the church?" We've been
[1:31:21] every church age has been given a word
[1:31:24] to the church just like I handed to you.
[1:31:26] What are you going to do with it?
[1:31:29] Those trials and tests are coming.
[1:31:33] If they're not here, I mean, they're
[1:31:34] here already for for most of us, right?
[1:31:37] It's there to see how you're going to
[1:31:38] react. It's there to see what you're
[1:31:41] going to do, what I'm going to do. If if
[1:31:44] I it doesn't mean that they're not going
[1:31:45] to be hard, but if if they're more than
[1:31:48] I can handle, it's because I'm trying to
[1:31:49] handle them. And I know that's like it's
[1:31:52] so cliche and it's so simple, but but
[1:31:54] yet [music] when I when I fail
[1:31:57] and I come back, this is exactly where I
[1:32:00] failed. And so until I don't fail this,
[1:32:02] I want to come right back to the same
[1:32:04] word and go, Lord, what what did I do
[1:32:05] wrong? And most of the time, if not all
[1:32:08] the time, it was when I tried to do it.
[1:32:10] is when I try to uh when I try to live
[1:32:14] it instead of letting him live it. It's
[1:32:16] when it's all those things. So again, um
[1:32:18] thank you for the time. I got paper all
[1:32:20] over the place. Sorry to the people
[1:32:22] clean the church.
[1:32:26] That was that was sister Kathy. I can't
[1:32:29] leave that one behind. So all right. God
[1:32:31] bless you. Brother Tom, if you want to
[1:32:32] leave a few songs. Thank you.
[1:32:44] You recognize this song title, Victory
[1:32:47] in Jesus.
[1:32:55] [music]
[1:32:57] I heard an old [singing] old story. How
[1:33:01] a savior came from [music]
[1:33:03] glory.
[1:33:05] how he gave his life on Calvary
[1:33:09] [music and singing] to save a rich like
[1:33:11] me.
[1:33:13] I heard about his groing
[1:33:17] of precious [music] blood at [singing]
[1:33:22] my [music]
[1:33:27] victory.
[1:33:30] Oh victory
[1:33:32] in Jesus
[1:33:34] my
[1:33:36] [music and singing]
[1:33:38] love
[1:33:42] with his redeeing love.
[1:33:46] He loved me here. I knew him and all
[1:33:53] is [music]
[1:33:55] he
[1:33:57] to victory. [music and singing]
[1:34:03] Heat. Heat. [singing and music]
[1:34:10] [music]
[1:34:14] to walk [singing]
[1:34:16] and he blind to see
[1:34:19] [music] and then I cry [singing] Jesus
[1:34:27] [music]
[1:34:28] and somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[1:34:33] the victory. [music]
[1:34:36] Oh victory
[1:34:38] in Jesus
[1:34:40] my savior
[1:34:43] [music]
[1:34:47] and he [singing]
[1:34:49] with his redeeing
[1:34:52] [music]
[1:34:53] he
[1:34:57] [music]
[1:34:58] all
[1:35:02] [music]
[1:35:04] to victory.
[1:35:17] very thankful to be here. We thank the
[1:35:19] Lord for what he's doing
[1:35:21] [sighs and gasps] when he continues to
[1:35:22] do. I don't I don't know what the Lord's
[1:35:25] doing in our assembly. We have just
[1:35:27] different people just showing up
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; randomly and they want to get baptized
[1:35:32] and and it's different than I've seen it
[1:35:35] and
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; but I know it's the Lord's doing
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; to this church soon as the Lord brought
[1:35:41] him to this church. I believe that
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; because it looked just like my church at
[1:35:45] home.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Thank you.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; We're going to wash. We're going to
[1:35:53] baptize you, Brother Everett.
[1:35:56] And when we do it, we'll do it in the
[1:35:58] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; We don't believe the water washes you.
[1:36:03] We believe you're washed by the blood.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; But we believe something's happening on
[1:36:07] the inside.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; And then it's you're manifesting that on
[1:36:11] the outside. Amen.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; We'll have a a word of prayer. Heavenly
[1:36:16] Father, Lord, we just thank you for
[1:36:18] these brethren. Thank you for sending
[1:36:19] them to our assembly. Lord,
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; we pray that we've been good witnesses
[1:36:23] for you, Lord, to these brothers. And
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; heavenly father, as he testified, he
[1:36:29] would like to do this. He's done it
[1:36:31] before, Father. But there's an
[1:36:32] experience that he wants renewed. And
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, it's we don't believe
[1:36:38] it's absolutely necessary. Our brother
[1:36:40] would have to be, but he desires it in
[1:36:42] his heart, Lord. And if there'd be a
[1:36:44] question, we we certainly would want to
[1:36:46] answer that question with the word,
[1:36:47] Lord. And so we're
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; doing this, heavenly father, and we're
[1:36:50] going to do it in Jesus name. And
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, we'd ask that as our brother just
[1:36:54] would even come out of the water. May
[1:36:56] you renew that experience in his life
[1:36:58] once again. We claim it for your honor
[1:37:00] and your glory.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord Jesus.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Father Evan, I'm going to turn you
[1:37:08] around. This is the direction of the
[1:37:10] east.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; And so this way right here.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Okay. I might have you bend down just a
[1:37:15] squat down just a little bit so we can
[1:37:17] get you all the way under. Would that be
[1:37:18] okay?
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; What's your middle name, brother
[1:37:22] Everett?
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Ever Douglas.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Vaughn.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Vaughn.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Everett Douglas. Vaughn. I baptize you
[1:37:30] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:44] I heard about a mansion he is built for
[1:37:49] me in glory.
[1:37:52] And I heard about the streaks of gold
[1:37:56] beyond the crystal sea.
[1:38:00] [music and singing] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:38:09] [music] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:38:17] [singing]
[1:38:17] [music]
[1:38:20] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:38:22] [music]
[1:38:28] [music and singing]
[1:38:31] Heat. Heat.
[1:38:36] [singing]
[1:38:39] [music]
[1:38:42] to victory
[1:38:45] [music] the cleansing blood.
[1:38:49] Amen. I think maybe William we can stay
[1:38:52] in F. I'd like to sing I'm bound for the
[1:38:55] promised land. Now if you're an oldtimer
[1:38:59] and I had to ask Sister Kathy because I
[1:39:02] didn't remember for sure. This was the
[1:39:04] song that Sister Shirley and Sister
[1:39:07] Nancy and Sister Mary, we always played
[1:39:10] at baptismals.
[1:39:13] And um so much so little tell a little
[1:39:19] story here. So much so that we had the
[1:39:22] kids. Maddie, when your mama was little,
[1:39:26] we got a cassette tape recorder out and
[1:39:28] grandpa got his guitar and we've got
[1:39:32] tapes of the kids singing these songs.
[1:39:35] Well, the kids wanted to sing I am bound
[1:39:38] for the promised land. So, that's what
[1:39:40] we sang. And uh but it was so ingrained
[1:39:46] in their head of when we sang this song
[1:39:50] that when we got to the end
[1:39:54] uh
[1:39:57] and we got to the very end, Andy, who
[1:40:00] was maybe
[1:40:03] six at the time,
[1:40:06] he goes splash.
[1:40:10] because he knew somebody was supposed to
[1:40:11] be getting baptized.
[1:40:13] So, we'll go back, take a little
[1:40:16] something back, [music] and it's just
[1:40:18] special for me because that's
[1:40:21] [music] what's uh imprinted. It's
[1:40:25] imprinted on my brain, Brother Kurt.
[1:40:29] On Jordan's [singing and music] stormy
[1:40:33] banks I stand and cast a wishful [music]
[1:40:39] night
[1:40:42] to [singing]
[1:40:44] There is
[1:40:48] where my [singing]
[1:40:50] [music]
[1:40:56] [music]
[1:41:02] [singing] pro
[1:41:05] [music]
[1:41:07] will come and go with me. I am bound for
[1:41:13] the pro land.
[1:41:17] All mortal
[1:41:19] lighting extended [singing]
[1:41:22] rain shines
[1:41:25] eternal [music and singing]
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; for
[1:41:37] my [music]
[1:41:42] for
[1:41:46] [singing and music]
[1:41:56] [music and singing]
[1:41:57] me. I am bound for
[1:42:03] [music]
[1:42:05] rising up. Okay,
[1:42:08] let's just bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:42:09] Father, Lord, we just [music] thank you
[1:42:11] for this opportunity,
[1:42:14] Lord. This brother that you've sent to
[1:42:15] us, brother Jeremiah, Lord, we
[1:42:18] don't baptize him, Lord, but may you
[1:42:20] baptize him with your spirit, Father.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, as I was praying this evening,
[1:42:26] Lord, what would you have me to do with
[1:42:27] this situation? And as the words came
[1:42:30] out of his mouth,
[1:42:32] God can heal that.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Then I just thought, Lord, if he's got
[1:42:36] that kind of faith, Father, then I
[1:42:38] believe, [music]
[1:42:40] Lord, that you're doing a work and can
[1:42:42] complete it. Lord, be with our brother
[1:42:45] Jeremiah. Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:42:48] Amen. What's your last [music] name?
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah Way.
[1:42:53] What's his last name?
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; What's his last name?
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah
[1:42:57] Washington.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Washington.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Like George.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Washington. Like George.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah. Praise the Lord. Face. This is
[1:43:04] the east like the direction of the
[1:43:06] rising of the sun. So face the [music]
[1:43:08] cross, brother Jeremiah. And I'm going
[1:43:10] to have you get very, very low. Okay? Or
[1:43:12] I can put you all the way under the
[1:43:14] water. Okay? And I'll help you come out.
[1:43:16] Okay?
[1:43:19] Put this in. Okay?
[1:43:21] Scratch it down about to where I am.
[1:43:24] Face the same direction and just squatch
[1:43:26] down to where I am.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah Washington,
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; you're doing good.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Baptize you. You're doing very good. We
[1:43:32] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:43:35] Jesus Christ.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:47] I got you.
[1:43:52] [snorts]
[1:43:53] Thank you.
[1:44:00] [music]
[1:44:01] First baptismal I remember in Flagstaff
[1:44:05] was Sister Kathy.
[1:44:09] A stock tank [music] out in the middle
[1:44:11] of a field
[1:44:14] in January. Yes. had six inches of ice
[1:44:19] on the top. The brothers had to go out
[1:44:21] there and chip the ice off. If anything
[1:44:24] ever looked like a watery grave,
[1:44:28] that tank looked like a grave.
[1:44:33] But
[1:44:35] Sister Kathy would not be withheld.
[1:44:40] Lord bless her. Amen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; 53 years ago, Sister Kathy.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:47] If we could sing this third verse,
[1:44:51] third and fourth verse, [music] and then
[1:44:52] we'll pray and dismiss.
[1:44:58] No chilling [singing]
[1:45:00] twins, nor poisonous breath can reach
[1:45:05] that hill. [music]
[1:45:10] Take [singing] this and sorrow
[1:45:14] and death are [music and singing]
[1:45:18] no more.
[1:45:21] Oh, I down for the [music and singing]
[1:45:23] pro land.
[1:45:27] I down for the pro land. [music]
[1:45:32] Oh, who will come and go with me? I am
[1:45:39] bound for the promised land. [music]
[1:45:44] When shall I reach that happy place
[1:45:49] [music]
[1:45:50] and be [singing]
[1:45:51] forever
[1:45:53] blessed?
[1:45:56] And [music and singing] shall I see my
[1:45:59] father's face and his [music]
[1:46:05] [singing]
[1:46:07] I for the prois land.
[1:46:12] I am down for [music] the prois land.
[1:46:18] Oh will come and go with me. [music]
[1:46:24] I am bound for the promised land.
[1:46:29] If we could bow our heads.
[1:46:32] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[1:46:34] mercies you've [music] extended towards
[1:46:37] brother Everett, brother Jeremiah.
[1:46:41] Lord, let tonight
[1:46:44] be a milestone. Lord, let it be
[1:46:47] something that's been put down
[1:46:51] that they never have to listen to the
[1:46:53] enemy's arguments. Lord, they've passed
[1:46:56] this.
[1:46:58] Lord, they have demonstrated
[1:47:01] to the body, Lord, [music] the stand
[1:47:03] they're making.
[1:47:06] We pray that you'd go with them. Bless
[1:47:08] them in the weeks ahead, Lord. might
[1:47:11] the blessing of this night not fail.
[1:47:14] [music]
[1:47:15] Keep them, Lord, we pray. Be with our
[1:47:18] body as we leave, Lord. Be with our
[1:47:20] brother Dawn. Grant him your mercies,
[1:47:23] Lord. Come by. [music]
[1:47:26] Lay your healing arm on him, Lord, we
[1:47:29] pray.
[1:47:31] Bless his body. Carry us safely through
[1:47:33] the streets, we ask, to our homes. In
[1:47:36] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:47:40] Good evening. You're dismissed.
[1:47:45] [music]
[1:47:47] We have an announcement.
[1:47:49] So, Sister [music] Vivian's memorial
[1:47:52] service will be here Saturday, December
