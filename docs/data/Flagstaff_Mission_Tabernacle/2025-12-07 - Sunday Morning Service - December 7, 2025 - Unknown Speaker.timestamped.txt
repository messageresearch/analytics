[21:56] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[22:00] Brother Ryan feel maybe that the Lord
[22:02] would be pleased with this just the Holy
[22:04] Spirit. You were singing or playing just
[22:08] before I came out. I shall declare
[22:12] I believe that
[22:16] you know I'm very as you all are I'm
[22:20] by God's grace and mercy I'm no longer a
[22:24] novice in the ways of understanding my
[22:27] Lord and Savior.
[22:31] So when I fall and fail him is when it
[22:34] hurts me so much because I I know that I
[22:37] just missed it by a little bit. That's
[22:39] all.
[22:42] But I find myself
[22:44] recognizing that.
[22:49] Sometimes I look at my emotions
[22:53] and I think, well, that speaks of God.
[22:56] And it does. Don't get me wrong.
[23:00] But the thing that speaks of God is the
[23:03] word of God. And when he tells me of
[23:07] what his plan is for me,
[23:11] then I grasp onto that. And I no longer
[23:14] go by my emotions.
[23:19] And so I shall declare
[23:21] what he's promised me this morning.
[23:25] He's promised the best for me.
[23:28] First of off, I'll tell you, if you
[23:31] don't know him, today's the day that you
[23:33] have the opportunity. Don't pass it up.
[23:38] But if you do know him,
[23:41] just shut the door.
[23:44] Just you and him. And we're going to
[23:46] sing to him before we take our prayer
[23:48] requests. And all heaven declares the
[23:51] glory of the risen Lord.
[23:56] Yeah. Heat.
[24:07] Heat
[24:20] up
[24:27] here.
[24:36] Oh,
[24:43] heat, heat.
[24:53] Heat. Heat.
[25:05] Heat.
[25:11] Heat.
[25:21] Heat. Heat.
[25:38] Heat. Heat.
[25:54] to worship you.
[26:00] Lord bless you. If you have a need, he's
[26:03] here this morning.
[26:06] If you have a need, just uplift it and
[26:07] we'll go to him now. Just bow our heads.
[26:13] Oh, precious heavenly father.
[26:18] Lord, what how grateful it is to have
[26:20] somewhere to go. Lord,
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm so grateful to
[26:28] to be able just to stop and
[26:31] just praise your name, Lord.
[26:36] Lord, we get so distracted and
[26:41] torn one way and torn to another.
[26:45] But Lord,
[26:47] you are such a peace, Lord.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, you just come by and bump us
[26:57] to the left, bump us to the right, and
[27:01] make us walk straight, Father.
[27:05] Lord, I just makes me think of I can't
[27:07] even walk without you holding my hand,
[27:09] Lord.
[27:12] A lot of times you got to pick me up and
[27:14] carry me, Father.
[27:18] Lord,
[27:20] just ask you to be with the needs of
[27:22] your people, Lord.
[27:24] Lord, we're so needy.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I I believe you want us to be
[27:29] needy, Lord. You want us to come to you
[27:32] with our needs.
[27:35] and just be like, I'm listening
[27:38] cuz I'm a terrible listener, Lord, but
[27:41] you you are not.
[27:43] Lord, just ask you to be with this
[27:45] service this morning. Lord,
[27:49] thank you for your touch, Lord. You're

[27:57] to hear a touch from you, Lord.

[28:29] you may be seated. Amen.
[28:34] Amen.
[28:41] Brother Steve thought that maybe it
[28:42] would be all right if we didn't have a
[28:44] scripture reading this morning. We'll
[28:46] just move into our worship service and
[28:49] preparation and uh know that each one
[28:53] came prepared to to see him and how we
[28:56] praise him. Amen. Amen. We have three

[29:06] him. All hail King Jesus. All hail King

[29:37] teachers. Amen. All hail King Jesus.

[35:12] He's the most gracious. You say, "Why
[35:15] does he put me through these troubles?"

[46:45] Lord. And so it's just a happy Amen.
[46:48] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[47:22] So many times I've questioned
[47:26] certain circumstances
[47:29] and things that I could not understand.
[47:36] Many times in trials,
[47:40] weakness blurs my vision and my
[47:44] frustration gets so out of hand.
[47:51] But it's then I am reminded
[47:54] that I've never been forsaken,
[47:59] never had to stand the test
[48:03] alone.
[48:06] As I look at all the victories,
[48:10] the spirit rises up in me. And it's
[48:14] through the fire my weakness is made
[48:18] strong.
[48:22] He never promised that the cross would
[48:26] not get heavy or that the hill would not
[48:30] be hard to climb.
[48:35] Oh, he never offered
[48:39] our victories without fighting, but he
[48:43] said would always come in time.
[48:50] So just remember when you're standing in
[48:54] the valley of decision
[48:58] and the adversary says,
[49:04] "Just hold on.
[49:08] Our Lord will show up
[49:12] and he will take you through the fire
[49:16] again.
[49:20] I know I know within myself that I would
[49:25] surely perish.
[49:28] But if I trust the mighty hand of God,
[49:31] he'll choose to see the flames again.
[49:37] again.
[49:42] He never promised that the cross would
[49:46] not get heavy or that the hill would not
[49:50] be ours to climb.
[49:55] Oh, he never offered
[49:59] our victories without fighting. He said
[50:03] help would always come in time.
[50:10] And just remember when you're standing
[50:14] in the valley of decision
[50:18] and the adversary
[50:20] says give in.
[50:24] Just hold on.
[50:28] Our Lord will show up
[50:32] and he will take you through the fire
[50:36] again.
[50:39] So just roll on.
[50:43] Our Lord will show up
[50:47] and he will take you through the fire
[50:51] again.
[51:00] Blessed be the name. Very scriptural.
[51:02] Amen. Sister Marcy, would you have a
[51:05] song for us? Amen.
[51:09] She's making ready.
[51:12] My dad called. I forgot to tell brother
[51:14] Brandon. Brandon. Um, dad said he just
[51:18] wasn't feeling well. That's that's where
[51:20] he's at today. He's just It's part of
[51:23] life. I think the elder ones are
[51:25] understanding that and I'm recognizing
[51:27] that a little bit.
[51:28] I told dad, I said,
[51:31] "Well, Dad, I
[51:35] love you,
[51:38] but the song that's been going through
[51:40] my heart,
[51:43] Sister Mary used to sing,
[51:46] more than ever before,
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, I love you.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; No matter what circumstance I'm in,
[51:54] Lord, I love you."
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. more than yesterday. I love you. I
[51:58] don't know about tomorrow. More than
[52:00] ever before, I love you. Amen. Lord
[52:04] bless you.

[54:08] every

[54:13] The blood
[54:15] that gives me strength
[54:19] from day
[54:21] to day.
[54:25] It will never
[54:28] lose
[54:30] its power.

[54:39] to the heart.

[54:50] to the lowest
[54:54] valley.

[59:40] time he preaches it uh July of 64 and he
[59:44] uses a phrase on those messages that's
[59:49] it finds itself also in the scripture
[59:51] here hued or huneed and he uses a phrase
[59:56] uh that you're cut out and the message
[1:00:00] cuts you out. the word cuts you out. And
[1:00:03] then he he goes in broken sistns and he
[1:00:06] says men have hewed themselves. And so
[1:00:09] one is you get cut out by God or you get
[1:00:13] shaped by him. And the other one is you
[1:00:15] shape your own way. We don't want that
[1:00:18] one. We want to be shaped and huneed by
[1:00:22] the Lord. And in first Kings 7 and verse
[1:00:24] 7 uh the Bible says, "Then he made a
[1:00:27] porch for the throne where he might
[1:00:28] judge." says Solomon, even the porch of
[1:00:31] judgment, and it was covered with cedar
[1:00:33] from one side of the floor to the other.
[1:00:36] In his house where he dwelt had another
[1:00:38] court within the porch, which was of the
[1:00:40] like work. Solomon made also an house
[1:00:43] for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had
[1:00:44] taken to wife, liken to this porch. All
[1:00:48] of these were of costly stones,
[1:00:52] according to the measures of hued
[1:00:54] stones. That means cut or cut out or
[1:00:58] adjusted. They're sawed with saws within
[1:01:01] and without even from the foundation
[1:01:03] unto the coping
[1:01:06] and so on the outside towards a great
[1:01:08] cart. And the foundation was of costly
[1:01:11] stones, even great stones, stones of 10
[1:01:14] cubits, stones of 8 cubits and above
[1:01:18] were costly stones. And when he says
[1:01:21] something in there like multiple times,
[1:01:23] gets me to pay attention there. So
[1:01:25] that's the third time. Now he said that
[1:01:26] they were costly stones after the
[1:01:29] measure of huge stones and cedars. Let's
[1:01:33] bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:01:36] have read your word and you have a
[1:01:39] promise placed in your scriptures that
[1:01:42] Lord as your word would be read and it
[1:01:43] would go forth that it will not return
[1:01:45] void. That means it does not return
[1:01:48] empty, Lord, but that you would
[1:01:49] accomplish what you would want it to
[1:01:52] accomplish. And this morning, that's our
[1:01:54] prayer, Lord, that we've read your word,
[1:01:56] and that would be enough to make this
[1:01:58] service a blessed service, Lord. We've
[1:02:00] praised you and worship you in spirit
[1:02:02] and truth. And so now we ask for you to
[1:02:05] come down and minister to our heart.
[1:02:06] Speak to us, Lord. Help us to grow,
[1:02:09] Lord, by your word, would you hue and
[1:02:11] cut us out even more? And would you
[1:02:14] shape us into the very image of the son
[1:02:18] of God? Would you cut us Lord? Even
[1:02:20] where it might hurt, where it might
[1:02:22] sting, and but where we would need it,
[1:02:24] Lord, we'd ask you to do that to us this
[1:02:26] morning. Be with us in Jesus name we
[1:02:28] pray. Amen. You may be seated. And this
[1:02:32] morning, um I guess this message is
[1:02:35] maybe a month or so in making.
[1:02:38] About a month ago, um
[1:02:42] someone sent an article to one of the
[1:02:44] ministers chats that I'm a part of. And
[1:02:46] in the article, I think we have it on
[1:02:48] the PowerPoint there. Sister Pauline, if
[1:02:51] you'd pull that up, I'll title this this
[1:02:53] morning. The I want to make the phrase
[1:02:56] they cost too much to make. They in the
[1:03:00] article, if you would go online and read
[1:03:01] it, it's a New York Times. Um, by the
[1:03:04] way, there's Sister Colleen is watching
[1:03:06] online. She says she's always watching
[1:03:09] online and she wanted to tell everybody
[1:03:11] hello and uh to let you know that she
[1:03:14] loves you and and she's with you. She
[1:03:16] wishes she was right here shouting, she
[1:03:18] said. But uh someday, you know, someday
[1:03:21] soon maybe the Lord will make a way.
[1:03:23] Anyway, so they in the article it says
[1:03:24] they cost too much to make. And what
[1:03:27] happened is the United States after 232
[1:03:30] years since 1793,
[1:03:32] we made the penny. we produced as a
[1:03:35] country a unit of monetary form that we
[1:03:40] would use to trade
[1:03:42] uh I don't know brother Donald I don't
[1:03:44] know how you would explain it but that's
[1:03:45] currency so we would trade gifts and
[1:03:47] goods and produce and it's how our
[1:03:50] country would run and and for 232 years
[1:03:53] we made this penny as a country and it
[1:03:56] was paid for things and now in 1800
[1:03:58] there's nobody here from the 1800s I see
[1:04:00] brother Bob he's not that old young
[1:04:02] people though you might think So, but in
[1:04:04] 1800 and I thought this was interesting.
[1:04:06] The penny the going rate for one's
[1:04:08] thoughts
[1:04:10] and u that was just a phrase from the
[1:04:13] article but not much else but for one's
[1:04:14] thoughts. Young people we used to say a
[1:04:16] phrase brother Austin, brother William,
[1:04:18] have you ever heard that? A penny for
[1:04:20] your thoughts. You have heard that?
[1:04:22] Well, praise the Lord. We still got a
[1:04:23] little bit of uh um what's the word?
[1:04:26] Influence on our youth. So, a penny for
[1:04:28] your thoughts. That used to be the going
[1:04:30] rate and that would be a fair amount in
[1:04:32] 1800 because in 1800 you could buy a lot
[1:04:36] of things. You could buy a loaf of
[1:04:37] bread. I think it's the next slide
[1:04:38] there, Sister Pauline. You could buy a
[1:04:41] biscuit, a pound of produce. Uh you
[1:04:44] could buy some apples or potatoes. Think
[1:04:47] about that. For a penny, you could go
[1:04:48] down to the market and get a loaf of
[1:04:50] bread. You could get some nails or tax.
[1:04:53] You could get a ride on the ferry.
[1:04:54] William, an Uber used to call. I know it
[1:04:57] wasn't an Uber, but it was a it was a
[1:04:59] penny. And you could get a ride on a
[1:05:02] ferry maybe from, you know, Staten
[1:05:03] Island to New York or wherever it would
[1:05:05] be for a penny. You could send a letter
[1:05:08] for a penny. Then in 1900, you know, as
[1:05:11] inflation would go, 100 years would go
[1:05:13] by, but you could still buy things. I
[1:05:16] remember and I'm, you know, coming up on
[1:05:18] 50 when you could, they had little
[1:05:20] gumball machines, brother Kurt, and you
[1:05:22] could go to a gumball machine with a
[1:05:24] penny and you could I some heads are
[1:05:27] shaking. You could put a penny in that
[1:05:29] gumball machine and you could get a
[1:05:31] piece of gum for a penny. In 1900, you
[1:05:34] could buy a cup of coffee.
[1:05:37] It's it's like 500 pennies now, you
[1:05:39] know. a piece of candy, a newspaper, a
[1:05:43] candle, some matches, one mile of
[1:05:46] railroad travel, you know, so if you had
[1:05:49] to go to Phoenix or whatever might cost
[1:05:50] you a dollar, but one mile of travel now
[1:05:53] in 2025,
[1:05:55] uh, here's what a penny can buy you. I
[1:05:57] think that's on the next one there.
[1:06:00] Nothing, right? Yeah. I just can't buy
[1:06:02] you nothing. I'm gonna start here with
[1:06:04] Brother William. So, Brother William, in
[1:06:07] my hand, I have coins.
[1:06:11] all most of the coins. I don't have a
[1:06:13] half dollar, but the Lord helped me find
[1:06:16] a a dollar.
[1:06:19] So there's coins,
[1:06:22] all the coins that United States
[1:06:24] produces and and there was a time when
[1:06:27] all of those had value. Even the penny
[1:06:29] had value. Even the weakest the weakest
[1:06:33] unit of monetary exchange had some value
[1:06:37] that you could go and if you know if you
[1:06:39] had one of those you could do something
[1:06:40] with it. And now as a country we're not
[1:06:43] even producing it. And I I wonder if in
[1:06:46] this case the natural is a type to the
[1:06:50] spiritual. I wonder if that the greatest
[1:06:54] value that it ever had. It could buy a
[1:06:55] loaf of bread. But it had value. It
[1:06:57] meant something and and now it has so
[1:07:00] much lost that value it's not even worth
[1:07:03] producing anymore and it really hasn't
[1:07:05] been worth producing for many years. It
[1:07:07] costs 3 cents. I think we have a slide
[1:07:09] there. The cost to make a penny is 3
[1:07:12] cents. So of course we stop producing
[1:07:15] them. It costs too much to make in now
[1:07:17] this is man's thinking but it costs more
[1:07:20] than even the value of the exchange of
[1:07:22] that that unit of currency. It cost 3
[1:07:24] cents to make it. A nickel cost 14
[1:07:27] cents. And if time were to go on, surely
[1:07:29] they're going to stop making nickels.
[1:07:31] They've stopped in many countries. In
[1:07:32] Peru, when I first went there, they had
[1:07:34] these light tiny little, it was like
[1:07:36] this big, this penny, a nickel, and they
[1:07:38] don't even make them anymore. They make
[1:07:39] I think their lowest is 50 cents. That's
[1:07:41] their lowest. A dime cost 6 cents. To
[1:07:45] make 10 cents, it costs 6 cents to make
[1:07:48] it. A quarter cost 15 cents. and a half
[1:07:50] dollar 34 cents to make.
[1:07:54] It costs too much. It's just it don't
[1:07:56] make no sense. Why why would we produce
[1:07:59] something that that now again just I
[1:08:02] want you to bear with me for a few
[1:08:03] minutes while we get to the point here,
[1:08:05] but it just it costs too much to make.
[1:08:07] And in the time of the Lord, there were
[1:08:09] coins made with actual silver. Now, our
[1:08:12] coins aren't made with silver. They're a
[1:08:14] combination of copper and it's very
[1:08:15] little silver even in a silver dollar.
[1:08:17] It's it's just a very small portion of
[1:08:19] silver. But in in the time of the Lord,
[1:08:21] you know, he was sold for 30 pieces of
[1:08:24] silver and Joseph for 20 and and and
[1:08:27] there's a time in Hosea, if you're
[1:08:28] reading along in the book of Hosea,
[1:08:30] Hosea went and bought his wife who was a
[1:08:32] prostitute. And God told Hosea, "Go do
[1:08:35] that because Israel has become a
[1:08:37] prostitute to me. She's become a she's
[1:08:40] committed whoredom to me." And so and
[1:08:42] so, Hosea, as a sign for this
[1:08:44] generation, why don't you go and do this
[1:08:47] certain thing as a type of what I'm
[1:08:48] doing? And and so Hosea went and he
[1:08:50] actually purchased for 15 cents. He went
[1:08:53] and purchased his own wife. Now put the
[1:08:55] next slide up there or the next portion
[1:08:57] of that a dollar. Now think about this.
[1:08:59] A dollar bill only cost three cents to
[1:09:01] make. A dollar bill. It's just very it's
[1:09:04] a very cheap currency to make it. But in
[1:09:06] the time of the Lord and maybe this was
[1:09:08] a coin like the coin that Jesus picked
[1:09:10] up. This would be what it would look
[1:09:11] like here. It's a it's a Caesar's coin.
[1:09:14] It's a Roman coin. It's a it's a silver
[1:09:17] coin. And Jesus would say it like this.
[1:09:19] What what what do you should you give
[1:09:20] unto Caesar what's Caesar? And he picked
[1:09:22] up the coin and and said, "Show it to
[1:09:24] me." And and then he showed and he said,
[1:09:25] "Listen, whose inscription whose face is
[1:09:28] on that coin?" And they said, "Well,
[1:09:29] Caesar's face is on." He said, "Now
[1:09:31] listen, give to Caesar that which is
[1:09:33] Caesar, but but give to God that which
[1:09:36] is God." And then what happened? Because
[1:09:38] man is like brother Donald said there
[1:09:39] we're born in a fallen state and and and
[1:09:42] and we're just in a state where where
[1:09:44] you know if there's a a robbery to be
[1:09:47] committed a a lie to be made that man
[1:09:49] has been doing that from the very
[1:09:51] beginning. And so what man would do with
[1:09:53] this money first of all how he would
[1:09:55] even make it he would have a stamp and
[1:09:56] he would melt the silver down and they
[1:09:58] would stamp the coin and then that would
[1:10:00] become a silver coin and that would have
[1:10:03] value in trading. And then men would get
[1:10:05] very smart and he would take the coin
[1:10:07] that had been stamped and he would shave
[1:10:10] the edges off if you put that next slide
[1:10:11] up there. And so so now he would they
[1:10:13] would call it clipping as it was an
[1:10:15] unclipped just an original coin. It
[1:10:17] would be as big and as large as the
[1:10:19] original stamping that had that that
[1:10:21] that had been made that the the founder
[1:10:24] or the man approved had had stamped that
[1:10:26] coin and he had just made it that way
[1:10:28] and it was unclipped or you know it
[1:10:31] hadn't anything hadn't been shaved off
[1:10:32] of it. was just as perfect and perfect
[1:10:34] could be. But man in his fallen state
[1:10:37] would think, "Now listen, I could shave
[1:10:39] a little bit off of the outside." Maybe
[1:10:41] that coin would represent this morning
[1:10:43] the entire word of God. Nothing but the
[1:10:46] word of God, the word of God in its
[1:10:47] fullness. But man would like to take the
[1:10:49] word of God and trim a little bit of the
[1:10:52] outside so that he can accomplish what
[1:10:54] he wants to accomplish. But then when he
[1:10:56] does that, he then makes the value of
[1:10:58] the coin worth less and he is no longer
[1:11:01] approved of God. Can I say it like that
[1:11:04] this morning? That that he no longer
[1:11:05] becomes approved of God. And so he would
[1:11:08] partially clip it, make it smaller or
[1:11:10] completely clip it. What would he do
[1:11:12] with the shavings? Well, he would shave
[1:11:14] it off and and astute men would do this
[1:11:16] or or or liars, we'll just call them
[1:11:18] like that. They would shave it off. Then
[1:11:20] they would have an amount of shavings
[1:11:22] and they'd go melt and make themselves
[1:11:24] another coin.
[1:11:26] And that's what would happen in the
[1:11:28] Lord's time is that man would take the
[1:11:31] original purified unadulterated word of
[1:11:34] God and they would try to shave a little
[1:11:37] bit out and and just clip it where, you
[1:11:39] know, it might hurt him a little bit.
[1:11:41] And so they would begin to clip it off
[1:11:42] or shave it and then they would
[1:11:44] partially clip it or clip it completely
[1:11:46] and then it would become a coin that was
[1:11:48] no longer approved by the weers who
[1:11:51] would ask for that coin and then weigh
[1:11:53] it appropriately and they would say this
[1:11:55] coin is no longer approved for trading.
[1:11:58] And you can say that about the word of
[1:12:00] God this morning. No matter how you try
[1:12:01] to clip it and how you try to cut it. It
[1:12:04] must be heued by God. And when it's heed
[1:12:06] by God, it's shued perfectly. And it
[1:12:09] does not change its shape ever because
[1:12:11] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday. The
[1:12:13] word is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:12:16] forever. But we've tried today to clip
[1:12:18] it. We've tried to cut it. We've tried
[1:12:20] to hue ourselves out the word of God and
[1:12:23] make it fit us. But let me tell you, the
[1:12:25] mantle is made and you must fit the
[1:12:27] mantle. The mantle is not you cut it to
[1:12:30] make it fit, but you must grow to fit
[1:12:33] the mantle that God has made. And that
[1:12:35] mantle is the Holy Ghost, the word of
[1:12:37] God. Now listen, there's a word that's
[1:12:40] used in the Bible, and it's not used a
[1:12:41] lot, but when I went to study it the
[1:12:43] other day, and it just there was this
[1:12:45] definition in the lexicon, and it
[1:12:47] actually said this, that in one century,
[1:12:50] more than 80 laws were passed in Athens
[1:12:52] to stop the practice of shaving or
[1:12:55] clipping down the coins then in
[1:12:57] circulation. But some money changers
[1:12:59] were men of integrity who would accept
[1:13:01] no f counterfeit current currency or no
[1:13:04] counterfeit money. And I would like to
[1:13:06] think there's men of integrity in the
[1:13:08] church. Not this church, you know, but
[1:13:11] the church as a whole. I would like to
[1:13:13] think there's men of integrity who would
[1:13:15] not change the word of God, who would
[1:13:17] not accept the counterfeit bill, men of
[1:13:20] honor. They would put only genuine full
[1:13:22] weighted money into circulation. Such
[1:13:24] men were called approved. Hallelujah.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Paul would say it like this. Timothy,
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; study to show yourself approved of God.
[1:13:37] Notice he said it like this. Timothy,
[1:13:39] listen. I've given you the entire
[1:13:42] fullness of the word of God. Now you
[1:13:44] study and show yourself approved of God.
[1:13:48] Show that you are the entire thing that
[1:13:51] God has created. And he said, "Listen, a
[1:13:53] workman needeth not to be ashamed and
[1:13:56] rightly divide the word of truth." Now,
[1:13:58] that doesn't mean get to cut what you
[1:14:00] want to cut, but that means share with
[1:14:02] the people with the spirit of the word
[1:14:04] and with the letter of the word. Don't
[1:14:07] just take the letter and divide that.
[1:14:09] That's not a rightly dividing. But when
[1:14:11] you rightly divide the word of God, you
[1:14:13] must divide it with spirit and you must
[1:14:15] divide it with truth. Doing one without
[1:14:17] the other, you're not a workman approved
[1:14:20] of God. And we've had quite frankly too
[1:14:22] much balance in Flagstaff Tabernacle. If
[1:14:25] I could say it like this. We've begun to
[1:14:26] get a little overbalance. I love the
[1:14:28] bulletin this morning. Just fits right
[1:14:30] in with what we wanted to say. We've
[1:14:32] gone to get a little loose. We've got
[1:14:34] too loose. We beun to shave a little bit
[1:14:37] where we think we can, you know, where
[1:14:39] where we want to apply it to our lives.
[1:14:41] But we ought to say it like the brother
[1:14:42] said it this morning. Lord, create in me
[1:14:45] a revival. Create in me a clean heart. I
[1:14:48] don't have a clean heart. Lord, I can't
[1:14:50] make a clean heart. I can't do it
[1:14:52] myself. But Lord, what I need is you to
[1:14:55] create in me. You cut it out.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; A clean heart in me.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Shun. He says, now he's telling Timothy,
[1:15:05] you must you want to be approved. You
[1:15:06] want to be a perfect coin,
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; not a penny, by the way.
[1:15:12] See, I don't preach a penny message. If
[1:15:16] you want a penny message, you go down to
[1:15:17] the Baptist church. No, I love that
[1:15:19] Baptist brother. And not even offense to
[1:15:22] the message, by the way. Not at all. If
[1:15:25] you want it just a little bit more, you
[1:15:26] might go to the Pentecostal church. But
[1:15:28] let me tell you, in this church, in this
[1:15:30] pulpit, we're going to preach a silver
[1:15:33] dollar message. We're going to preach
[1:15:35] the entire thing. We're not going to
[1:15:37] preach it with fear. We're not going to
[1:15:38] be afraid. But this message that came is
[1:15:42] not a message for pennies. Don't throw
[1:15:44] them away. Don't reject them. That's all
[1:15:46] they got. But this message is a silver
[1:15:48] dollar Abraham faith seed message and
[1:15:52] that's what's going to get preached from
[1:15:53] this pulpit.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But shun now Paul tells
[1:15:56] Timothy shun profane and vain babblings.
[1:15:59] That's vain godless empty chatter and it
[1:16:03] works unto ungodliness. He says they'll
[1:16:05] increase unto more. They're shaving
[1:16:08] down. Oh, no. This is brother Steve here
[1:16:10] just maybe not adding but just they're
[1:16:12] shaving down the word of God and cutting
[1:16:14] down the weight of the pure word of God.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; And their word will eat as doth gang
[1:16:22] green.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; That's what that means right there.
[1:16:25] Sister Paulie put that up there. Their
[1:16:26] word will eat as doth a canker. The word
[1:16:29] is actually in Greek gang green.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; It eats as a canker of whom is and he
[1:16:34] names them. And I'm I'm loathed to name
[1:16:38] anybody, but you know what I'm saying?
[1:16:39] Says that that he names them there.
[1:16:41] There must have been something serious
[1:16:43] going on. And and these men must have
[1:16:45] been coming in and saying things like
[1:16:47] there's no more resurrection. The
[1:16:49] resurrection has come and gone already.
[1:16:51] And Paul says, "Listen, that's a gang
[1:16:54] green cancer trying to spread in the
[1:16:56] church and it's wrong. And don't you
[1:16:58] believe it?"
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; And they might say this morning,
[1:17:01] "Brother Steve, the days of miracles has
[1:17:03] passed. That's a gang green cancer. The
[1:17:05] days of miracles is not passed. I saw a
[1:17:08] miracle this morning. If you want to
[1:17:09] know the truth, I saw one last week and
[1:17:11] a week before. The days of miracles is
[1:17:14] not passed. And the day of the greatest
[1:17:16] miracle that God can change your desires
[1:17:19] and make you can't wait till the doors
[1:17:21] of the church come open. Those days of
[1:17:23] miracles is not over either. Notice what
[1:17:25] he says. Who concerning now he's naming
[1:17:28] these guys and he says concerning the
[1:17:30] truth they've heired. They say that the
[1:17:32] resurrection is passed already and they
[1:17:34] overthrow the faith. Well, no wonder
[1:17:37] it's a cankerous grain grain.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; They're overthrowing the faith of some.
[1:17:44] And listen what he says. And they're
[1:17:46] just going down a little far. I think
[1:17:47] verse 21 here. Well, excuse me. We'll go
[1:17:49] we'll keep going.
[1:17:52] Yeah. They they they overthrow. Oh, I
[1:17:55] can't leave this out. Nevertheless, the
[1:17:57] foundation of God stands sure. Yes, it
[1:18:00] does.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Having this seal, the Lord knows them
[1:18:04] that are his, and let everyone that
[1:18:06] nameth the name of Christ depart from
[1:18:09] iniquity.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; But he says this in a great house.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; There are not only vessels of gold and
[1:18:17] silver. We wonder, you know, and it gets
[1:18:19] in our minds sometimes, brother Steve,
[1:18:22] what about all these other brothers? I
[1:18:24] know a lot of good Christian people, so
[1:18:26] do I, brothers and sisters. but in the
[1:18:28] same house. And if you want to be
[1:18:30] Where'd those coins go? Pass them
[1:18:33] around. Brother William, I want
[1:18:34] everybody to at least look at them all.
[1:18:36] You got a choice this morning. You can
[1:18:39] purify your life. You can accept the
[1:18:42] atonement in its completeness if we
[1:18:44] could say it like that. And you can be a
[1:18:46] faith seed silver dollar or you can go
[1:18:49] and be a penny.
[1:18:52] All right. So now in the same house, in
[1:18:54] the great house, there are not only
[1:18:56] vessels of gold and silver, but also of
[1:18:58] wood and earth, and some to honor, and
[1:19:01] some to dishonor. If a man therefore
[1:19:05] purge himself from these,
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; from what? Purge himself from what? He
[1:19:11] It's like there's vessels of gold and
[1:19:13] and silver and and there's vessels of
[1:19:15] honor and dishonor. Well, if you're
[1:19:18] purging yourself, you're purging
[1:19:20] yourself from dishonor. the vessels of
[1:19:22] the things that you would have in your
[1:19:24] life that that are dishonorable to God.
[1:19:26] Paul said, "Purge those things out of
[1:19:28] your life and and purge it so you can be
[1:19:31] purge yourself from these and you can be
[1:19:33] a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meek
[1:19:37] for the master's use, and prepared for
[1:19:39] every good work." So, it don't matter,
[1:19:40] we don't know what you are. There might
[1:19:42] be a whole a whole church load of silver
[1:19:44] dollars or or a whole church load of
[1:19:46] pennies. Either way, if you're a penny,
[1:19:48] praise God, you cost too much to make to
[1:19:50] throw you away. Amen. If you've given
[1:19:52] your life to the Lord Jesus this
[1:19:54] morning, you cost too much to make. How
[1:19:56] much did you cost to make if you're a
[1:19:57] penny this morning? You cost the blood
[1:19:59] of the Lord Jesus Christ. And in no way
[1:20:02] will God ever stop making them until he
[1:20:04] comes to to sanctify purge this earth.
[1:20:07] He's going to he's going to he's going
[1:20:09] to pay for those pennies until he comes.
[1:20:11] He doesn't say they don't have value.
[1:20:13] And I'm not saying they don't have value
[1:20:15] either this morning. But I am saying I
[1:20:17] don't want to stay a penny.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense?
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Got too many pennies and nickels and
[1:20:24] dimes. I I I think we should all grow
[1:20:27] into the stature of that fullness of the
[1:20:30] measure of the perfect body of the Lord
[1:20:32] Jesus Christ. Okay. So now, so now he
[1:20:35] says, he says, "Purge yourself and and
[1:20:38] you'll be a vessel into honor,
[1:20:40] sanctified, and and the master will use
[1:20:42] you and and be prepared for every good
[1:20:44] work." Purge yourself.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; And that's a paradox. I can't You just
[1:20:51] said, "I can't clean myself, Brother
[1:20:52] Steve, and I can't purge myself and I
[1:20:55] can't make a revival happen." Well, you
[1:20:59] got to take the other side of it, too.
[1:21:01] You can't just take one without the
[1:21:03] other, say, "Well, I'm just waiting for
[1:21:05] God to clean me up." Mhm. He's waiting
[1:21:08] for you to clean yourself up, too. Well,
[1:21:10] you said, "Well, that there's both sides
[1:21:12] of the of the coin." Says, "You can't
[1:21:14] just take one without the other. You
[1:21:16] can't take mercy without truth. You
[1:21:18] can't take law without spirit." And so,
[1:21:21] you must have them both. Okay. Now, now
[1:21:23] Hannah one time, now she was afflicted.
[1:21:25] And she makes a great statement in her
[1:21:27] prayer. She was she she couldn't have
[1:21:29] children. and and her sisters or
[1:21:31] sisters-in-law or the other wives I
[1:21:33] think they were of of Eli or man I can't
[1:21:36] even think of his name now but anyways
[1:21:38] they were making fun of her because she
[1:21:39] couldn't have children and and in that
[1:21:41] making fun of her they were afflicting
[1:21:43] her and they were making fun of and
[1:21:46] afflicting and they would they would
[1:21:47] mock her because she was barren and then
[1:21:50] she says in 1 Samuel she says there's
[1:21:52] none holy as the Lord there's none
[1:21:54] besides thee neither is there any rock
[1:21:56] like our God talk no more exceeding ing
[1:21:59] proudly. Now she turns her her her
[1:22:02] spirit to talk to that spirit that's
[1:22:04] mocking her. She says, "Let no arrogancy
[1:22:06] come out of your mouth. For the Lord's a
[1:22:08] God of knock of knowledge and by him our
[1:22:12] actions weighed." Listen, if there's
[1:22:14] going to be a weighing this morning,
[1:22:16] brother Steve not going to do the
[1:22:17] weighing. The word is going to do the
[1:22:19] weighing because by the word our actions
[1:22:22] weighed. And Proverbs Solomon says it
[1:22:24] like this. All the ways of a man are
[1:22:26] clean as his own eyes, but the Lord, he
[1:22:29] weighs the spirits. Now, it's not only
[1:22:32] your actions that are being weighed, but
[1:22:34] the spirit behind the motive behind what
[1:22:38] you do every day is weighed in the great
[1:22:40] balance of God Almighty. So now
[1:22:43] everything you do is placed on that
[1:22:44] balance. And God looks at it and weighs
[1:22:47] it and determines if it meets the full
[1:22:50] measure of his word. My
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; wonderful
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Paul explains who's the judge.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; He says in 2 Corinthians 10, for he that
[1:23:01] commendeth himself,
[1:23:03] not he that commendeth himself
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; is approved.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; It's not you that you make yourself
[1:23:12] commended or approved.
[1:23:14] I don't get to weigh my own actions and
[1:23:17] say I approve of that thing.
[1:23:20] Now, what you do in whatever you do in
[1:23:22] life, you don't get to say, "I'm going
[1:23:25] to do this and I there's too much of I
[1:23:27] got to do this. This is just something I
[1:23:28] do and and that's just how it is." No,
[1:23:30] no, no. But every action and every
[1:23:33] motive, every spirit behind what you do
[1:23:35] is weighed. You don't commend and you
[1:23:36] don't approve your own actions. But God
[1:23:39] approves everything you do. It's God who
[1:23:42] commends it or honors it or gives honor
[1:23:44] to every action that you might have. He
[1:23:47] says this first of all when you come
[1:23:48] together in the church and now he's
[1:23:50] about to give instruction on communion
[1:23:52] and and taking the Lord's supper supper
[1:23:54] and then he says I hear that there be
[1:23:56] divisions among you and I partly believe
[1:23:59] it. I I think that it could be. He says
[1:24:01] for there must be also heresies among
[1:24:03] you. And here's the reason that they
[1:24:06] which are approved may be made manifest
[1:24:08] among you. Think about that. There's
[1:24:11] going to be things that are allowed in
[1:24:13] this church that are critical and then
[1:24:15] God is going to say, "Now listen, are
[1:24:17] you going to stand up for that thing?
[1:24:19] Are you going to stand against that
[1:24:21] thing?
[1:24:23] I allow it there because those which are
[1:24:26] pure are going to be made manifest." In
[1:24:29] this church, it's the same way. Well,
[1:24:31] brother, are you saying some sure
[1:24:33] something could enter into a church and
[1:24:35] you would have a decision to stand with
[1:24:37] the true word of God or to stand against
[1:24:39] it?
[1:24:40] It's going to be manifest what's in you.
[1:24:44] My what a what a thought. He says now
[1:24:46] there m there there must be that they
[1:24:48] which are approved may be made manifest.
[1:24:52] And God obviously has a reason anytime
[1:24:56] he does that. You know last sun last
[1:24:58] Sunday we read a scripture in Ezekiel
[1:25:00] about being equal. We'll read it again.
[1:25:02] I think it's just it's just a beautiful
[1:25:04] one. Chapter 33. It says, "If the wicked
[1:25:06] restore the pledge, the wicked now and
[1:25:09] give again that he had robbed, walk in
[1:25:11] the statues of life without committing
[1:25:13] iniquity, he'll live. He'll not die."
[1:25:15] This is the wicked and he he restores
[1:25:17] the pledge. He gives again. He walks in
[1:25:20] the statues of life. He doesn't commit
[1:25:21] iniquity. He'll live. And but he's
[1:25:23] wicked, but he you look listen. He
[1:25:25] turned and he he turned from his ways.
[1:25:27] He says, "None of his sins that he's
[1:25:29] committed shall be mentioned unto him.
[1:25:31] He's done that which is lawful and
[1:25:33] right. He'll surely live." Yet the
[1:25:35] people say the way of the Lord is not
[1:25:37] equal.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; But I say their way is not equal.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; And it paradox and it doesn't seem. But
[1:25:47] God says this, listen, in whatever state
[1:25:49] you find yourself, check and don't check
[1:25:52] it against your your own commanding,
[1:25:54] your own what you want to do. Check it
[1:25:57] against God's word and then find out if
[1:25:59] it matches God's word. if it doesn't
[1:26:01] turn from that thing and then your sins
[1:26:03] won't be remembered anymore. And you
[1:26:05] say, "Well, well, that doesn't seem
[1:26:06] equal." Well, it is equal cuz your
[1:26:08] equality, your coin that you are has to
[1:26:11] match God's word.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; You can't not match God's word. You have
[1:26:16] a choice when you hold those coins in
[1:26:18] your hand this morning. Are you going to
[1:26:20] be a penny, a dime, a nickel? Are you
[1:26:22] going to be a quarter? Or do you want to
[1:26:25] be a silver dollar? And don't tell me,
[1:26:27] Brother Steve, I'm just not a silver
[1:26:29] dollar. That's a lie out of the pits of
[1:26:31] hell. Paul says, "Purify yourself. Be a
[1:26:35] vessel of honor." Do it. Be that thing.
[1:26:38] Not just accept that you're a penny,
[1:26:40] dime, or nickel, but you've got the
[1:26:42] choice to purify or not purify yourself.
[1:26:44] To live fully for God or not live fully
[1:26:47] for God. To be a penny or be a false
[1:26:49] silver dollar faith seed of Abraham.
[1:26:52] That's on you this morning. And thank
[1:26:55] God it's not on me. I just get to preach
[1:26:57] the word. And by the way, as hard as it
[1:27:00] is, cuz some of these things you think,
[1:27:01] if I didn't care about you, it'd be
[1:27:03] easy, it would be easy, but I do care.
[1:27:07] And so, it's like the other day when I
[1:27:09] was in a meeting and I just felt this
[1:27:10] rebuke coming forward on this brother
[1:27:12] and it was seemed very direct and it it
[1:27:15] seemed very obvious and forceful and it
[1:27:17] hurt, but I knew it was the truth and I
[1:27:19] knew he needed it. And God gave me a
[1:27:21] scripture in that moment and he said
[1:27:23] this, listen, open rebuke is better than
[1:27:26] secret love. So, I'm not going to
[1:27:28] secretly love you. I'm going to openly
[1:27:30] rebuke not you, but the evil spirit that
[1:27:33] would try to sneak into Flagstaff
[1:27:34] Tabernacle.
[1:27:36] We can't let that happen. Praise God.
[1:27:39] And I love you. And that's why Brother
[1:27:41] Bam said this. Now, the seventh angel's
[1:27:43] message is to to open the mystery of the
[1:27:45] seals, calling the 11th hour, I love it,
[1:27:48] gentile workers to receive the same pay
[1:27:52] that the first hour workers got. Ain't
[1:27:54] that beautiful? You want a different
[1:27:57] Pentecost
[1:27:58] or you want the same Pentecost that
[1:28:00] Peter had. Personally, I want the same
[1:28:02] Pentecost Peter had. I want the same
[1:28:04] Holy Ghost Peter had. I don't want a
[1:28:05] different one, a lesser one. Hey y, you
[1:28:07] got to work in the last church age. I
[1:28:09] want the same Holy Ghost and fire that
[1:28:12] fell at the day of Pentecost. Praise
[1:28:14] God. Now, Jesus taught it. He said there
[1:28:15] were some people went to the harvest.
[1:28:17] They were hired and when they did of
[1:28:18] early morning, they received a time, a
[1:28:20] penny for the day. Then at noon time,
[1:28:23] someone else come in and went to work.
[1:28:24] Then at the 11th hour, the last hour day
[1:28:26] that someone come in and receive the
[1:28:28] same kind of pay that they did at the
[1:28:30] same kind of pay. Come on, saint. It's
[1:28:32] not, think about it now that you know
[1:28:34] what happened at the Holy Ghost day of
[1:28:36] Pentecost. The fire fell from heaven and
[1:28:38] they went out like drunk people and they
[1:28:40] thought they're not drunk. It's just the
[1:28:42] third hour of the day. They weren't
[1:28:43] drunk, but they were drunk on the Holy
[1:28:46] Spirit fire of God. Oh my, last hour.
[1:28:49] It's so perfectly how the first
[1:28:51] messengers with the word, with the
[1:28:53] gospel, with the truth, they come in the
[1:28:54] day of Pentecost. Then there was a dark
[1:28:57] age that blocked them out.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Then at the middle of the day, Luther,
[1:29:00] Wesley, and them came in. And then
[1:29:02] there's to be an evening time message
[1:29:04] and to receive the same thing that they
[1:29:08] did at the beginning. He's interpreting
[1:29:10] this parable to us. You always thought,
[1:29:13] well, it's just if someone when they're
[1:29:14] 70, if they get saved, they get the same
[1:29:16] pain. No, no, no. It also applies to you
[1:29:19] and Peter at the day of Pentecost. His
[1:29:22] holy ghost is no different than yours.
[1:29:24] It's the same Holy Ghost he received
[1:29:26] that we received this morning.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, but we must have the same faith that
[1:29:30] he had also. That's the other part of
[1:29:32] it. And there's to be a message and
[1:29:34] receive the same thing. The evening time
[1:29:36] message is to restore back again to
[1:29:38] bring back that same thing again. What a
[1:29:40] beautiful interpretation of that that
[1:29:42] parable this morning. Now, what about
[1:29:44] brother Steve? What about the ones who
[1:29:46] are the they're the not bride? They're,
[1:29:48] you know, they just would seem to be a
[1:29:49] different vessel. He says it like this.
[1:29:53] Now, and then at that time, see, the
[1:29:56] gentile bride is in heaven and the
[1:29:58] sleeping virgin, the gentile virgin.
[1:30:00] Notice that parable of the foolish
[1:30:02] virgins begins like this. The kingdom of
[1:30:04] heaven,
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; it doesn't begin part of heaven and part
[1:30:10] of hell was like five virgins or five
[1:30:12] good and five bad virgins. No, no, no.
[1:30:14] It begins, the kingdom of heaven was
[1:30:16] likened to 10 virgins. Okay? So now you
[1:30:20] know it's not the kingdom of heaven or
[1:30:21] half heaven and half hell. It's the
[1:30:23] kingdom of heaven and they're virgins.
[1:30:26] They're pure. They're holy. So now he's
[1:30:28] going to tell us what happened here. The
[1:30:30] gentile virgin is not to be saved during
[1:30:32] that time. She's already been saved, but
[1:30:35] has been rejected in the bride and she
[1:30:37] only goes through the tribulation period
[1:30:39] for the time of purification. She's
[1:30:41] saved, but she goes through for
[1:30:43] purification because she has rejected
[1:30:46] Christ, the word for her purification.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Do you remember what Paul told Timothy?
[1:30:51] Timothy, purify yourself.
[1:30:55] She's rejected Christ for her
[1:30:57] purification. So the word then she has
[1:31:00] to suffer for her deeds. But the bride
[1:31:02] who has become the word, a complete
[1:31:04] atonement was made of Christ cuz he's
[1:31:07] the word, the body that was rendered.
[1:31:09] And when that body was rendered, the
[1:31:10] bride was in that body cuz it's all the
[1:31:12] word. Amen. You see it? Now, this is in
[1:31:13] the morning. And in the afternoon, he
[1:31:15] comes back and and and gives us a little
[1:31:18] more insight to what he's talking about.
[1:31:20] He says, "Now, just a minute. Will the
[1:31:21] foolish virgin be saved?" It's a
[1:31:23] question. No. Whatever happens, she
[1:31:25] happens. Now, after that time, she's in
[1:31:28] the state. Now, she will have to go
[1:31:29] through the tribulation period. And the
[1:31:31] reason of it is because she has rejected
[1:31:33] the atonement in its fullness. Now, when
[1:31:36] he says, "Is she saved?" It's like is
[1:31:38] she he's saying is she going to be saved
[1:31:39] during that time? Is that the reason
[1:31:41] that that she's going to be because you
[1:31:43] know during that time? No, no, no. He's
[1:31:44] saying not not during that time she's
[1:31:46] saved but she didn't accept Christ in
[1:31:49] the fullness. She didn't accept the
[1:31:50] atonement.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Now just real simple question this
[1:31:55] morning. Do you accept the atonement in
[1:31:57] its fullness? Amen. Okay. So now so now
[1:32:00] that's the difference. She rejected the
[1:32:03] word the fullness of the atonement. And
[1:32:06] because of that, she goes through to get
[1:32:08] her purification.
[1:32:10] That that's just that's just just the
[1:32:12] word. All right. The Bible said, "And
[1:32:13] the rest of them, the dragon spurted out
[1:32:14] water out of his mouth to go and make
[1:32:16] war." And what an hour.
[1:32:20] And we've addressed this question. It
[1:32:21] seems like it comes up because Satan
[1:32:23] uses it, this question to try and sew
[1:32:27] doubt into your mind. But I know people,
[1:32:30] they're good Christians. Well, let me
[1:32:32] tell you, if they're a penny, you know
[1:32:34] what God can do with a penny?
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, in the hand of God, you have any
[1:32:38] idea what God can do with Don't Don't
[1:32:40] reject them. Are you kidding me? They're
[1:32:42] good people. They're wonderful. That's
[1:32:44] fine. I I wouldn't reject them at all.
[1:32:46] But but man, if you saw the light of the
[1:32:49] message, why would you want to go and be
[1:32:51] a penny and be satisfied with a penny's
[1:32:53] worth of of atonement when you can have
[1:32:55] the full atonement of completeness?
[1:32:59] I hope that makes sense. It does. Okay,
[1:33:02] all these believers, as we could go on
[1:33:03] for hours, all these were like a bunch
[1:33:05] of change out of your pocket
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; in God's hands. Notice,
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; he didn't call a penny an unbeliever.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't say all these p, you know,
[1:33:14] these pennies were unbelievers and these
[1:33:15] quarters were make, you know,
[1:33:16] midbelievers and and then a full dollar
[1:33:18] and no, no, no. All these were believers
[1:33:22] were p were a change out of your pocket
[1:33:25] in God's hand. You pull out a bunch of
[1:33:27] change. There's pennies, nickels, dimes,
[1:33:29] quarters, half dollars, dollar all in
[1:33:31] coins. Now, that's what the world is in
[1:33:34] God's hand. There's some people that can
[1:33:37] just that just can have a penny worth of
[1:33:40] it. And God can only use them in a penny
[1:33:42] way. That's all they can buy.
[1:33:46] Don't reject them.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; If they can't believe the real truth,
[1:33:50] don't turn them down. Don't kick them
[1:33:52] out and say they're not in it. Cuz God
[1:33:53] uses pennies sometimes. He does. Oh,
[1:33:56] that's where we go. We go and Satan
[1:33:58] wants to see Satan's so tricky. He'll be
[1:34:00] like, "See, they're good people. They're
[1:34:02] just you're like them." No, I'm not like
[1:34:04] them. No, I'm not like them. Matter of
[1:34:06] fact, in my fruit, I might not even be
[1:34:08] as good of them. But I've accepted the
[1:34:10] full word and the full atonement for my
[1:34:12] age. So, don't tell me I'm like them.
[1:34:14] I'm not like them, but I'm not going to
[1:34:17] reject them either. See, Satan tell
[1:34:19] you're like them. No, I'm not like them.
[1:34:21] Well, well, there and in that case, you
[1:34:22] could just go and No, I'm not going to
[1:34:24] reject them either. Do you see the fine
[1:34:26] line? Cuz if Satan can get you to reject
[1:34:28] them, you just became a denomination.
[1:34:30] And if he can get you to say that you're
[1:34:32] like them, then he's just, you know,
[1:34:33] he's brought you down to a penny level.
[1:34:36] But I'm not like them and I don't reject
[1:34:38] them. I've accepted the fullness and God
[1:34:41] can use them pennies. I'm not better
[1:34:43] than them. I I don't lift myself up. I
[1:34:45] just believe that Christ came and I
[1:34:47] accept everything he gave me this
[1:34:49] morning.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help me. That's the truth of
[1:34:54] that statement there, saints.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; You're not like him.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; And don't reject him. It's a See, I see
[1:35:01] it's a Satan tries to trick you. He
[1:35:03] tried to trick me many times. I see him
[1:35:05] trying to like that snake on Wednesday
[1:35:06] night. You know, he tried to bite me
[1:35:08] sometimes. Oh, I bind that thing in the
[1:35:10] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Okay. If they can't believe
[1:35:15] the real truth, don't turn them down.
[1:35:16] Don't kick them out and say they're not
[1:35:18] in it. Cuz God uses pennies sometimes.
[1:35:21] Lot was just a penny.
[1:35:23] Well, it costs too much to make. It
[1:35:26] costs three cents.
[1:35:29] Well, the the the the the Christian who
[1:35:31] you would consider the weakest
[1:35:33] Christian.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; I mean, the one who you would think just
[1:35:37] the weakest, you know,
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; you know what Jesus did for them on the
[1:35:40] cross?
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; He died for them.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; He didn't die mostly for them and all
[1:35:45] for you. He died for them on the cross.
[1:35:49] Oh, they cost too much to make. We'll
[1:35:50] reject them. We're not rejecting them.
[1:35:52] And Jesus's not going to stop making
[1:35:53] them.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; He ain't going to stop making them until
[1:35:57] the rapture comes and we're out of here.
[1:35:59] And then he goes and that's then he
[1:36:01] turns to the Jews. But until then, they
[1:36:03] don't cost too much to make. He died for
[1:36:06] the sins of the whole world. Praise God.
[1:36:09] So we'll take a 100 carnal believers
[1:36:11] will never stand in their presence. Oh,
[1:36:13] I like it. Oh, wait, wait, wait. We got
[1:36:15] to back up. Abraham was a silver dollar.
[1:36:18] He got silver dollar in that change.
[1:36:20] It's kind of gold looking but you know
[1:36:23] now it taken a hundred lots to make an
[1:36:25] Abraham.
[1:36:28] That's beautiful. And so it will take a
[1:36:30] 100 carnal believers will never stand in
[1:36:32] the presence of a genuine Christian
[1:36:34] that's separated from the carnal things
[1:36:36] of the world living. See catch every
[1:36:39] statement there. Don't just be like a
[1:36:41] good Christian he believes the minute
[1:36:42] message of the hour. No. No. separated
[1:36:46] from the carnal things of the world,
[1:36:48] living in Christ Jesus where the word
[1:36:50] can flow through him. Oh, just
[1:36:54] ministers. No, no, sir. The word conf.
[1:36:57] Now listen, he's separated. He's
[1:37:00] separated from the carnal thing. He's
[1:37:01] living in Christ Jesus and the word, the
[1:37:04] Lord Jesus Christ flows through him. I
[1:37:07] mean, that takes a hundred lots to make
[1:37:09] someone like that. that that you know
[1:37:11] even that you know he's in Sodom and and
[1:37:13] he was living there and and his
[1:37:15] righteous soul was vexed. Lots was oh
[1:37:17] but Abraham was living in in heavenly
[1:37:19] places in Christ Jesus and and because
[1:37:22] of that the word flowed through him. He
[1:37:24] can only take a penny's worth. That's
[1:37:25] all he's got. So you see people that say
[1:37:27] I don't believe in healing. I don't
[1:37:28] believe in these things. Just know it's
[1:37:30] a penny. But just let him alone. See
[1:37:33] just a penny's worth for that's so
[1:37:35] that's that's all he can buy. Don't stop
[1:37:37] him. Just let him alone. Remember that's
[1:37:38] all the farther he can go. Joseph was
[1:37:40] separated
[1:37:42] from his. Oh, we see we're separated.
[1:37:45] Our tendency is to reject or our
[1:37:48] tendency is to think we can join or we
[1:37:50] can be like them or they're good. See
[1:37:51] how Satan is? He's so very tricky. He
[1:37:54] tried to get you both sides. Get you to
[1:37:55] reject them or get you to join them.
[1:37:57] Nope. Neither one. Stay up on a
[1:38:00] mountaintop. Live up there. Hey, don't
[1:38:03] reject Lot, but don't go down to his
[1:38:05] world and join him down there in Sodom.
[1:38:07] Don't become like that. You keep your
[1:38:09] eyes on the real dollar. Don't worry,
[1:38:11] we're we're getting sort of towards the
[1:38:12] end. Listen, sure, the devil has a
[1:38:14] pattern for everything God has. He's a
[1:38:16] hypocrite out there trying to act like a
[1:38:17] Christian. That don't mean there's no
[1:38:19] Christians. It's true. He has an old
[1:38:21] witch sitting out on the corner and a
[1:38:22] mental psychic reader sitting over there
[1:38:24] with a fortune teller. She's a devil
[1:38:26] trying to impersonate a prophet.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; That doesn't take away the value of a
[1:38:30] prophet. Certainly not. It only
[1:38:32] magnifies the prophet. But don't focus
[1:38:35] on the devil. the fortune teller, the
[1:38:37] magician, none of that. You focus on the
[1:38:40] true. And guess what? That'll help you
[1:38:42] identify the false. A bogus dollar don't
[1:38:44] mean there ain't a real one. It means
[1:38:46] there is a real one. If it wouldn't,
[1:38:48] that would be the real. If there was no
[1:38:50] if a bogus dollar, if there wasn't one
[1:38:52] it was made off, it would be the real. A
[1:38:54] bogus dollar only shows that there is
[1:38:56] something real. You can't have a
[1:38:58] counterfeit dollar. The first penny that
[1:39:00] was ever made was the original penny
[1:39:02] that was made. And if they ever, you
[1:39:04] know, wanted to waste three cents and
[1:39:05] make another penny, what you would do is
[1:39:07] study the real penny, the original, and
[1:39:10] then then then you would know the
[1:39:11] counterfeit. And there couldn't have
[1:39:12] ever been a counterfeit unless there was
[1:39:14] an original in the first place.
[1:39:18] We got too much studying
[1:39:21] the false dollars.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; We had too much studying the false
[1:39:25] pennies, too much studying the false.
[1:39:28] Focus on the real prophet, the real
[1:39:32] minister who rightly divides the word,
[1:39:34] who teaches it and preaches it without
[1:39:36] fear, without giving favor to somebody,
[1:39:39] without compromising, without, you know,
[1:39:41] faking like he loves you and pat patting
[1:39:43] you on the back and and no, no, no, none
[1:39:45] of that. I read an article yesterday. It
[1:39:47] was about this church popped up on my
[1:39:49] feed. You know, this church is growing.
[1:39:51] Thousands of members can't hold
[1:39:52] anything. And and then the top part of
[1:39:54] the article said, "And then you can walk
[1:39:56] drive up to the church and hear the rap
[1:39:57] music playing in the parking lot." I
[1:39:59] thought, "Well, you ain't going to
[1:40:01] compromise. I don't care if it comes
[1:40:04] down to nobody.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; We're not compromising." So, we just if
[1:40:07] it fills up, praise God. It empties out.
[1:40:10] Praise God. We're not compromising
[1:40:11] either way. Listen, but let me tell you
[1:40:13] something. What Brother Brandham said.
[1:40:15] We haven't got that money. You poor men.
[1:40:16] All we're poor men. You're poor men. All
[1:40:19] of us are. That's right. We live by the
[1:40:21] arms of the people being ministers. But
[1:40:23] brother in Africa, one little black boy
[1:40:25] about this high or a prostitute off the
[1:40:26] street yonder in Louisville, one soul
[1:40:29] saved in eternity. When that star is
[1:40:31] shining yonder, your name will be
[1:40:33] wrapped into it. There's your value.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; So you give some to the missions or you
[1:40:38] go on a trip or you preach to your
[1:40:40] neighbor or you just walk down the
[1:40:42] streets of Flagstaff and someone can see
[1:40:44] the shining light of your your your of
[1:40:46] your life just glowing. That's a that's
[1:40:49] a value to that soul that's given to
[1:40:52] you. He says the shining light. He said
[1:40:54] there's your value. It isn't how much
[1:40:55] you got, how much you desire. It's how
[1:40:57] much you can do
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; toward saving souls
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; for Christ Jesus.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; That's your value. What's your value?
[1:41:05] How much money? How much this? What
[1:41:07] position you have in the church? Nope.
[1:41:08] How much you do towards saving souls?
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; All right. We're going to say a couple
[1:41:15] things and then we'll we'll we'll begin
[1:41:18] to wind down. Joshua had a commission to
[1:41:20] go over and take that land.
[1:41:22] And God caused a great paradox. See, God
[1:41:25] had put in order the sun
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; and he, you know, the sun even kind of
[1:41:31] moves its way through the galaxy. Then
[1:41:33] he put all the stars, the planets, and
[1:41:36] they they move across the sky. They
[1:41:38] wander. Actually, the name in Greek
[1:41:40] means wanderer because they just wander.
[1:41:42] They followed this path across the sky.
[1:41:44] God put them in order. He put the moon
[1:41:47] just in Genesis there. He he caused the
[1:41:49] moon to be the light by night and and
[1:41:51] then he caused the sun and the earth and
[1:41:53] he put everything in order and it was
[1:41:55] all working. He designed the law of
[1:41:57] gravity so that it would go and and the
[1:41:59] laws that that would cause the galaxy to
[1:42:02] turn and the solar system to turn and
[1:42:04] all that God placed in order in Genesis
[1:42:07] at the beginning. He put it, he formed
[1:42:09] it, he placed it. It was running
[1:42:11] perfectly in order.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; And then one day,
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; someone needed a little more light.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; And God had put everything in order, and
[1:42:22] it had worked for thousands of years,
[1:42:25] functioning in order, but one son of God
[1:42:28] asked for a little. He asked for God's
[1:42:31] God, would you interrupt your entire
[1:42:34] mode of solar system and and the the
[1:42:37] properties of physics and the properties
[1:42:39] of quantum mechanics and and all those
[1:42:41] things? Can you interrupt that? I just
[1:42:43] need a few more hours.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Veron said, "God put a scar in
[1:42:48] the sky of the momentum of his great
[1:42:51] kingdom, of his great formation of
[1:42:53] planets so that Joshua could win a
[1:42:55] battle." Oh my. One son of God. He says
[1:42:59] it like this. In the presence of God,
[1:43:01] who has more authority? An angel or a
[1:43:03] son of God. You know what he said? A son
[1:43:05] of God. And you know, I found it
[1:43:06] yesterday or the day before where he
[1:43:08] said a an angel behind the pulpit or a
[1:43:11] son of God behind the pulpit. He said,
[1:43:12] "A son of God behind the pulpit has more
[1:43:14] authority." Why? Cuz if you take this
[1:43:17] word, you got as much authority as God
[1:43:19] himself would to be standing there.
[1:43:21] Praise God. I got the quote. I'll show
[1:43:23] it to you later. Anyways, for the for
[1:43:25] the kingdom of God is not meat and
[1:43:27] drink. Amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Listen, let's go to verse 18. For he
[1:43:30] that in these things serves Christ is
[1:43:34] acceptable to God
[1:43:37] and approved of man. So if you serve
[1:43:40] Christ and these things, you're
[1:43:42] acceptable to God and approved of men.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Okay. What things?
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; It's not meat and drink.
[1:43:52] He says, "Righteousness,
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; peace,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; and joy."
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; We need a little bit of joy.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; We certainly need righteousness and
[1:44:04] peace and all that, but sometimes we
[1:44:05] forget
[1:44:07] to have a little bit of joy in the Holy
[1:44:09] Ghost.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; We're going to have the musicians come,
[1:44:14] but they're we're just going to talk for
[1:44:16] a few more minutes.
[1:44:19] And this is uh
[1:44:23] it's December 7th, you know, a day
[1:44:26] that'll live in infamy, I think. Was it
[1:44:28] FDR? Brother Donnie, who said that?
[1:44:35] So, our visitors, I'm going to apologize
[1:44:37] ahead of time because this is just for
[1:44:39] our body.
[1:44:42] Go ahead and put that picture up there.
[1:44:43] So,
[1:44:46] uh, I hope y'all you know how much I
[1:44:48] love you. All of you know how much I
[1:44:51] love you.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to talk to you. And this
[1:44:54] is the third time I've actually
[1:44:55] mentioned this subject. One time I was
[1:44:57] subtle. The other time I was a little
[1:45:00] more direct. And for now, I'm going to
[1:45:03] be just about as direct as I can be. But
[1:45:05] you probably still had to read between
[1:45:06] the lines.
[1:45:08] Um,
[1:45:11] if I'm wrong, I'm just wrong. Uh, not
[1:45:14] doctrinally, but I've prayed. So, if I'm
[1:45:17] wrong, um, a lot of prayer is goes ahead
[1:45:20] of me with what I'm going to talk to you
[1:45:22] about.
[1:45:23] Um, balance is one thing, but looseness
[1:45:26] is another.
[1:45:28] We don't say, "Well, Brother Steve,
[1:45:30] every say don't watch filthy things on
[1:45:32] your television, but I believe the
[1:45:34] balance is you just once in a while can
[1:45:35] watch it." No. No. That's not balance.
[1:45:38] That's looseness.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Uh, brother Steve, I, you know, certain
[1:45:43] things that I just believe this. You
[1:45:45] better, you better check yourself
[1:45:47] against the word of God.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; You better do it. Now, I'm going to be
[1:45:51] very, uh, as much as I can be this
[1:45:54] morning, and I'm just going to ask you
[1:45:56] ahead of time. Just don't don't text me
[1:46:00] or call me about this till after the
[1:46:02] first of the year. Okay? So, just right
[1:46:04] there, just ponder it. Um, today love
[1:46:08] might be a little bit corrective
[1:46:10] and maybe it'll be a day that'll
[1:46:12] Flagstaff Tabernacle live in infamy, but
[1:46:15] it's going to be corrective. And I'm
[1:46:16] doing this cuz my friends have been
[1:46:19] hurt. And I mentioned this at the men's
[1:46:21] meeting back in July, and I just haven't
[1:46:23] seen much improvement.
[1:46:26] Uh what I mentioned was we need to be
[1:46:28] more consecrated and we need to uh you
[1:46:32] know we're just being loose and we're
[1:46:34] loose in the church and we're loose with
[1:46:36] our families and and we need to buckle
[1:46:39] up
[1:46:40] and
[1:46:42] yeah I'm not going to force you. Uh
[1:46:44] there's a scripture I read this morning.
[1:46:46] It's in Ezekiel
[1:46:48] and maybe it's Hosea, but he says, you
[1:46:51] know, pastors that have forced people,
[1:46:53] you're never going to get forced. you.
[1:46:54] I'm not coming knocking on your door and
[1:46:56] dragging you to church or dragging you
[1:46:58] to Bible study.
[1:47:00] Like, it's not not going to do it. There
[1:47:03] there there's some that might do that.
[1:47:06] But my friends, so there's over 80
[1:47:09] people in this church that pays tithes.
[1:47:14] 85 maybe. That includes children and
[1:47:16] families where their parents would. And
[1:47:18] if we get 60 on a Sunday morning like
[1:47:21] this morning, praise God.
[1:47:23] It's like
[1:47:25] why is why do we have 80 or 85? It was
[1:47:28] approaching 90 I think. But I just
[1:47:30] wanted to give a little grace to some of
[1:47:32] those who stay home
[1:47:34] uh for health reasons.
[1:47:38] But that many people in a congregation
[1:47:40] and when we have a Bible study we have
[1:47:42] five.
[1:47:44] And what happens is the teachers,
[1:47:47] it hurts them. man, you've hurt me for
[1:47:50] seven years because you haven't been
[1:47:52] faithful into the body, but I can handle
[1:47:54] it. Like, I got the burden.
[1:47:57] No problem. Like, I'll just deal with
[1:47:59] it. But when you hurt my friends,
[1:48:05] if I see it over or they leave, they
[1:48:06] leave because of, you know, they want a
[1:48:09] body that's faithful, then I'm going to
[1:48:10] say something like I'll deal with it
[1:48:13] myself and just, well, I just am not
[1:48:15] going to get them here so I feel better
[1:48:18] or get them to Bible study or the youth
[1:48:20] Bible study or a or a Christmas program
[1:48:22] event
[1:48:24] where it's like half of the kids show
[1:48:25] up. Maybe you're hurting my friends
[1:48:29] and you're hurting the body. You're
[1:48:30] making feeble the the the brothers and
[1:48:33] sisters that pour their soul into Sunday
[1:48:36] school. 10 pe 10 kids.
[1:48:39] We have at least 20. I know that.
[1:48:42] And and we're hurt. You're hurting their
[1:48:44] Sunday school teach. Look at your Sunday
[1:48:45] school teacher and and and tell her why
[1:48:48] you didn't or him why you didn't show up
[1:48:50] or why you didn't bring your kids. you
[1:48:52] didn't think it was important or you
[1:48:54] know something else was more important
[1:48:55] in your life
[1:48:57] and so it's hurting
[1:49:00] like I said for seven years I put up you
[1:49:02] know just I'll just bear it but I can't
[1:49:05] anymore without being very clear it got
[1:49:08] to stop and I apologize to the visitors
[1:49:12] got to hear this but um
[1:49:17] all All right,
[1:49:24] bulletin. I love Sister Victoria. I know
[1:49:26] she's not here. I'm so glad she put this
[1:49:28] in here, but it is so false.
[1:49:33] I'm really glad, Brother Will. Tell her
[1:49:34] I'm glad she put it in there. That way I
[1:49:36] could. A church is a gift from God. Some
[1:49:38] assembly required. What do you think is
[1:49:41] false about that statement, Brother
[1:49:42] Donald?
[1:49:44] Some some
[1:49:46] really but I like it brother will
[1:49:49] because it gave me an opportunity to
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; some assembly is not required. Let me
[1:49:53] tell you what the prophet of God said if
[1:49:54] that's okay. The Holy Spirit in you will
[1:49:56] not hunger for the world. It'll hunger
[1:49:58] for God. If it's hard for you to go to
[1:50:00] church and press yourself to come when
[1:50:02] the church when the church is open,
[1:50:04] there's something wrong with that
[1:50:05] spirit. It's trying to keep you away
[1:50:07] from God. The spirit of God will run you
[1:50:10] right straight to the church. Every time
[1:50:13] the door opens for fellowship, not some
[1:50:16] assembly required.
[1:50:18] He said every time. So it should say
[1:50:20] church is a gift from God. Every time
[1:50:21] the doors are open, assembly required.
[1:50:25] Yes, sir. See, you got to be sure of
[1:50:26] this now. The time is at hand. The time,
[1:50:29] you know, for our perspective wasn't at
[1:50:31] hand in 1988. You know, I used to look
[1:50:34] at brother Billy Paul and he's like in
[1:50:36] his 50s and I'm like, "Ah, 60 is going
[1:50:38] to be an old man. I got to give my heart
[1:50:40] to the Lord by the time like n early
[1:50:41] 90s."
[1:50:43] Like the time is way at hand now.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Can you look at Israel? Time's at hand.
[1:50:47] You Russia back in back in action about
[1:50:49] the bomb. The time is at hand. And so if
[1:50:52] the spirit's not driving you to church
[1:50:54] every time it's open,
[1:50:57] it's the wrong spirit
[1:50:59] and other thing. Not church is just not
[1:51:01] the only thing. It's not I mean church
[1:51:03] is a main thing that we do but there's
[1:51:05] Bible studies there's youth Bible study
[1:51:07] there's Christmas program events and
[1:51:09] when you don't show up any sisters and
[1:51:11] brothers have poured their soul into it
[1:51:14] and they like are weeping discouraged
[1:51:16] because nobody shows up.
[1:51:20] All right. Every person that's saved
[1:51:22] ought to have a church home. They ought
[1:51:24] to be in church and there every time the
[1:51:26] church has a surface service
[1:51:29] or every time you pass it, go in, open
[1:51:33] the doors, go in and pray or do
[1:51:34] something. Love the Lord.
[1:51:37] All right, I hope I made myself again.
[1:51:39] Don't I don't because here's the thing,
[1:51:41] saints. Pull up that next picture.
[1:51:44] So, this is how I feel. Special thanks
[1:51:46] to Chad GPT for putting this together
[1:51:48] for me. Uh or Google AI, I can't
[1:51:51] remember which one it was. So there's
[1:51:52] like a few people there. There's like
[1:51:54] one or two people rowing. There's a
[1:51:56] whole bunch of people like hanging on
[1:51:59] and and we need trustees. We got two
[1:52:02] trustees in their mid80s. I already have
[1:52:05] resignation from a third trustee. I have
[1:52:07] a treasurer and one other trustee.
[1:52:11] Well, I'll be a trustee. Steve, we'll
[1:52:13] get in the boat first. I can't make a
[1:52:15] trustee or a deacon or anybody unless
[1:52:16] you're in the boat rowing first.
[1:52:20] Does that make sense? Yes.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:52:23] deacons Chase and brother Mitchell are
[1:52:25] just worn out and brother Tom
[1:52:30] and Brother Dawn, brothers and sisters,
[1:52:32] it should be obvious to you the state of
[1:52:34] these things.
[1:52:36] And then then we trustees and deacons,
[1:52:38] brother Tim. And I'm I'm sorry again.
[1:52:41] I'm not sorry, but I'm sorry. For the
[1:52:42] visitors, I'm sorry. You shouldn't have
[1:52:44] to hear this. I got brother Tim back
[1:52:46] there running the video and the audio.
[1:52:48] And when he's not here, I got Sister
[1:52:50] Pauline doing multiple things. And it's
[1:52:52] like,
[1:52:54] and they're discouraged. They've been
[1:52:57] slaving for, and brother Tim would never
[1:52:58] ask me to say anything, by the way,
[1:53:02] ever. Sister Pauline hasn't complained a
[1:53:04] single second,
[1:53:06] but
[1:53:08] I hope you can read between the lines.
[1:53:10] Okay.
[1:53:11] All right.
[1:53:15] All right. Go ahead and play some,
[1:53:17] Brother Ryan. I hope you're applauding
[1:53:19] that was the truth from the Lord and not
[1:53:22] what I think. It's not what I think. I
[1:53:23] see people hurting and discouraged and
[1:53:25] and I see unfaithfulness and I'm I'm
[1:53:28] trying to it's too late to be messing
[1:53:30] around and I for you that those of you,
[1:53:33] you know, Sister Rose will drive up here
[1:53:35] with her 90-year-old mother on Sundays.
[1:53:37] If she don't drive up on Wednesday, give
[1:53:38] me a break. Okay? I'm not obviously
[1:53:40] there's situations. Okay? So, we're
[1:53:43] reasonable about these things. But, uh,
[1:53:46] so if you live, you know, just, you know
[1:53:48] what I'm saying? All right. Praise the
[1:53:49] Lord, brother Ryan.
[1:54:02] Pure and whole
[1:54:06] for you. Let's all stand. Oh Lord,
[1:54:11] prepare
[1:54:14] to be a sanctuary.
[1:54:31] I'll be
[1:54:40] for you. It's your time
[1:54:48] to be a sanctuary.
[1:55:02] Heat.
[1:55:05] Heat.
[1:55:17] in the presence of joy.
[1:55:20] Yes.
[1:55:33] Oh,
[1:56:02] heat, heat. Oh,
[1:56:21] does anyone know the verses to really
[1:56:24] do?
[1:56:29] Yeah.
[1:56:33] Heat.
[1:56:43] Yeah.
[1:56:49] Heat.
[1:57:07] Oh,
[1:57:28] heat, heat.
[1:57:33] Yeah.
[1:57:37] Heat.
[1:57:47] Oh,
[1:58:09] heat, heat.
[1:58:13] Yeah.

[1:58:34] Oh,
[1:58:48] heat, heat.
[1:59:04] Heat. Heat.
[1:59:16] Heat.
[1:59:20] Heat.
[1:59:37] Yeah.
[1:59:44] Heat.
[1:59:54] Oh,
[2:00:16] heat, heat.
[2:00:34] Let's just bow our heads this morning.
[2:00:36] Heavenly Father, we we bow before you
[2:00:39] humbly. And Lord, we start by just
[2:00:42] acknowledging our own faults,
[2:00:44] our own failures and struggles in life,
[2:00:48] Lord. And so we ask your forgiveness,
[2:00:51] Lord, that we may be more pure. Purify
[2:00:54] us, Lord, in our hearts, Lord, as I
[2:00:57] heard the prophet say this morning. Make
[2:01:00] me have a thirst. Make me have a hunger,
[2:01:03] Lord, that I didn't have before.
[2:01:06] I can't make it, Lord. Help me, Father.
[2:01:08] I need your help. And I'll do my part,
[2:01:10] Lord. We promise to do our part. Forgive
[2:01:12] us of our failures, Lord. We know the
[2:01:14] time is short. We don't want to reject
[2:01:16] any portion of that atonement, but Lord,
[2:01:19] we accept it in its fullness this
[2:01:21] morning. Once again, Lord, forgive me if
[2:01:23] we've offended anybody by our words, but
[2:01:25] it's your word, Lord, that we speak. And
[2:01:28] we ask, Father, that our eyes would be
[2:01:32] more open to see you more clearly. And
[2:01:35] Father, we we don't mean ever to offend,
[2:01:38] but Lord, we can help. when a fire is
[2:01:41] burning within us, Lord, to speak your
[2:01:43] word, it it would be impossible to quill
[2:01:46] or quench that fire, Lord, that's coming
[2:01:48] up. And Lord, we acknowledge you in the
[2:01:51] midst of us this morning. We acknowledge
[2:01:54] your presence.
[2:01:56] We ask you to help us, Father, as we go
[2:01:58] through this month and coming into the
[2:02:00] new year, Lord, that you draw us closer
[2:02:02] to you, Father. Let this be a moment
[2:02:05] when we draw closer to you and serve you
[2:02:07] more.
[2:02:10] And we put you even greater position in
[2:02:13] our life. First in our life above
[2:02:16] everything. Lord Jesus, forgive me where
[2:02:18] I failed. Lord, so many times I failed
[2:02:21] to put you first. And I acknowledge that
[2:02:25] and ask for your help moving forward and
[2:02:27] for help of this body. And Lord, I thank
[2:02:29] you for all the souls that come this
[2:02:31] morning, Lord. And I see the church
[2:02:34] full, Lord, like it should be. And I
[2:02:36] thank you for that. And I ask that it
[2:02:38] would continue to be that way and to
[2:02:40] grow and so we may be more encouraged in
[2:02:43] you, Lord Jesus, and with each other.
[2:02:46] Help us, Father God. We love you. Be
[2:02:47] with us. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[2:02:51] We'll sing that one more time in the
[2:02:53] presence.
[2:03:04] Heat.
[2:03:10] Heat.
[2:03:20] Oh,
[2:03:42] heat, heat.
[2:03:55] How about we'll sing this as we're
[2:03:57] dismissed. God be with you till we meet
[2:03:59] again.
[2:04:01] God be with you. Ponder those words for
[2:04:03] a few weeks. Not from me, but I pray it
[2:04:06] was the spirit of the Lord just
[2:04:08] reminding us to uh consecrate ourselves
[2:04:11] greater than ever before. Amen.
[2:04:17] God
[2:04:19] be with you till we meet
[2:04:23] again.
[2:04:28] Counels guide
[2:04:32] you
