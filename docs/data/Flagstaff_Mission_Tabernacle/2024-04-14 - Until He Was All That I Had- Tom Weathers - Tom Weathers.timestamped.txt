[0:03] [Music]
[0:10] the storm they were facing was
[0:14] fearful the ship looked so small in the
[0:18] waves the wind kept violently
[0:23] blowing and yet they were still all so
[0:28] safe from out of the dark he came
[0:33] walking he had never lost them from
[0:37] view he can see through the darkest of
[0:42] troubles he just wanted them to see it
[0:49] too that you'll never be filled till
[0:54] you're emptied until you're broken
[0:57] you'll never be whole
[1:00] until the Potter is tried Your Vessel
[1:04] with fire you'll never come forth as
[1:08] pure
[1:10] gold I didn't know how much he loved me
[1:15] until I'd passed through the storm and
[1:18] looked
[1:19] back I didn't know Jesus was all that I
[1:24] needed until he was all that I had
[1:30] [Music]
[1:34] sometimes the storm that you're
[1:37] facing may seem like your whole world
[1:41] has
[1:42] changed and the fire just keeps grow and
[1:46] hotter as the Potter is shaping the
[1:51] clay friend Jesus he knows what he's
[1:56] doing even though it causes you
[2:01] pain he just wants you to know the
[2:05] lessons he showed his
[2:08] disciples is still the
[2:13] same that you'll never be filled till
[2:16] you're emptied until you're broken
[2:20] you'll never be
[2:22] whole until the Potter is tried Your
[2:26] Vessel with fire you'll never come forth
[2:30] as pure
[2:32] gold I didn't know how much he loved me
[2:37] until I'd passed through the storm and
[2:41] looked
[2:42] back I didn't know Jesus was all that I
[2:47] needed until he was all that I had oh I
[2:53] didn't know how much he loved me until
[2:57] I'd passed through the storm and look
[3:01] back I didn't know Jesus was all that I
[3:06] needed until he was all that I had
