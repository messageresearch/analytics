Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love it. Rolando and I were talking about what he said a week or two ago about how, you know, the Pentecostals make us look bad. We have way more revelation and it seems like they got and I said, "Well, where did you come to the message?" And he said, "In chapas." And I said, "Well, how are they in Chapas?" And he says, "I guess which." Which is like same as you guys. But I didn't take it personally, Rolando. I did not take it personally. It was the word. And so I said, "Amen. We need to do better. &gt;&gt; We need to do better." That's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh, a couple things. Um, I do have the container back there with for questions. I say container because if I say box, we all have post-traumatic stress, you know. So, um, sorry. Um, so anyways, for questions for the 25th, the service on the 25th, the Lord is in it. I really feel because I already got a question asked and the Lord was already working before the question was even asked and the answer is already there. So, I know the Lord is in it January 25th. So, you got a few weeks there if you want to put a question. Do we have an update on Brother Dawn? Did he go home yesterday? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. No. Okay. He got home though. Perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we'll add him to our prayer list there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um we had brother Ryan, I wanted him to do like a three-part on uh the word of the church. And yesterday I was talking to Aaron McGary. I didn't tell brother Ryan this, but I was talking to Aaron McGary in the afternoon. We spent like an hour and a half chatting. And and one of our topics was earlier in our ministries, we'd go to a place and we had a message that we knew was inspired and we just take it and just preach it even though it wasn't the inspired for the time, you know, we just knew it was a good message, you know, and we're at a new church and they're going to like it, you know, that preach. We're just preachers and we're just people. And then we talked about how as we've gotten older, we realize I only want to preach what the Lord wants me to preach today and that's it. So we started talking about that and we see we see other ministers making the same mistake where it just seems like they just, you know, and so it's not a criticism. We're all learning. And &gt;&gt; so we just talked about that. We and we spent a little while on that topic. Then Ryan sent me a message last night. Hey, I know we had kind of planned to talk about this, but what do you think if I just feel to go this direction? It's right in line with what you were talking about on Sunday. And I said, "Perfect, man. I'm not even I've already had that conversation today." So, do it. So, that's the direction we'll go and then we'll take prayer, Lord willing, afterwards. So, I like that song. When the roll is called up yonder. Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother. Let's start with the first verse there. Um on that, doesn't it say something on that? When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and the morning breaks eternal right there. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. When the road is called up yonder. When the roll is called up yonder when the all is called up yonder. I'll be there. Amen. It's not just a song. It's a plan. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; It's a plan. Not just words, right? It's a uh should be a mindset. Amen. Lord, help us. Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord. Appreciate the uh opportunity from the our pastor. Um thank you the musicians. Thank you, brother Orlando, for that special. Um I pray that this is uh this is in line with what he was talking about. It just really felt maybe you won't see the tie, but it certainly tied in for me. just something that I had been studying uh been studying for the last few months and um when he was speaking on Sunday, how many appreciated the message on Sunday? Just real real good. Um spoke to me anyways. I definitely was was uh was fed spiritually. So, um, and I just had this on my heart and and not to to get away from the subject that we were on, but, uh, sometimes it's good just a little get a little in between snack in between meals. Amen. So, uh, I pray that this is a blessing for you and I pray that the Lord speaks to us tonight out of his word. Amen. Let's just read a scripture and then we'll have you be seated. uh Revelations chapter 5 and um and then we'll read another scripture right afterwards. I I enjoy Wednesday nights. I really just have grown to love Wednesday nights uh I want to say more than Sunday, but I really feel like we can get into like the meat of the word. And uh I don't know about you, but I really love just getting a recharge in the middle of the week. Um maybe I was the only one that gets a recharge in the middle of the week, but uh I pray that you do, too. and and and let's just uh let's just have church tonight, right? We made the effort to come here and drive in the cold and what's going to be icy when we leave. Let's just have church while we're here. Amen. And then so uh Revelations 5, um we'll read a few verses ch starting at one. And I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?" Um, very important scripture here. Uh, no man in heaven, nor in earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the book. No man &gt;&gt; was able to do it, neither to look thereon. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and read the book, neither to look thereon. One of the angels saith unto me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth unto all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. Let's just read one more scripture. Um, I was a little bit inspired a few months ago. Um, I was just happened to read this scripture about a week before we had I think his name is Brother Aaron, the brother visiting from uh, Brother Nathan Bryan's church. He spoke a couple services for us. I really enjoyed what he said and he he had made a comment and not that I disagreed with it, but I just tell you where my mind was at at the time. I had the scripture on my heart and I'd written it down and then two days later he speaks and he said he made a comment which uh, I just thought, man, I'm going to dig into that. and he said, you know, it's not like um you know, it's not like I'm we're Paul or anything with this great revelation um to be able to warrant the thorn in our sight. And I started to think about that. I just written down that scripture and so if it'd be all right um maybe just to touch on that subject in 2 Corinthians, maybe that doesn't make sense to you, but it really was just got my got my mind going. 2 Corinthians chapter 12. I know we're standing for a little bit, but um we'll let you sit down right now. 2 Corinthians 12:7, "Unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure." That's true. &gt;&gt; For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. and he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness. &gt;&gt; Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me, &gt;&gt; not taking it personally, &gt;&gt; as we heard on Sunday, &gt;&gt; not taking it personally. Therefore, I take pleasure &gt;&gt; in infirmities, &gt;&gt; in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong. Let's just bow our heads. And Lord, we would just ask you would just bless, Lord, your word that we have read, Father. And would you just for the next however long you would like it to be Lord will we just forget about Lord what we have going on in time and our thoughts Lord and all these things and would we just surrender our minds and our hearts to you Lord. Would you just come and speak to us Lord in Jesus name we pray. Amen. You may be seated. And so if I um um if I had maybe a title it would it would just be this that there was given to me a thorn. And uh you know we don't know we don't know from the scripture um what Paul's thorn was. Um it doesn't say whether it was physical, whether it was spiritual. Brother Brandham um goes into it a little bit. Said perhaps it was his eyesight, perhaps it was all these things, but we don't know what it is for sure. But we do know that he had something that was so um I don't know what the word is, maybe stressful or so um such a persecution in his life that he that he sought the Lord out three times. So it wasn't just a Lord, could you deliver this from me? It was something that just perplexed him over and over and over again that he sought the Lord out multiple times for a healing. And this is this is Paul that we're talking about. This is Paul that that you know people raised from the dead under his ministry and and and blinded eyes he killed and walls of a jail literally falling down just at the praises of Of course we know that's not Paul but you think that if the ministry of Paul carried that type of weight that if he went to the Lord and sought him to have something removed from his life that his prayer would be answered. And yet the Lord said the Lord did not deliver him from it as we know in the scripture and he says my grace is sufficient for thee. Um you know this it made me think of the scripture in in Peter. It said beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you. &gt;&gt; We're not to look at the trials and I I just talk to myself that a lot of times I look at trials and I this is just going to be a real basic simple message if that's okay. I just look at my trials and I wonder uh why is this happening to me? &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've ever asked that question or or even, you know, did I do something to bring this trial on to me? And um I'll just read a quote here out of Hebrews chapter 3. Brother Ram says, "He was in jail and he asked the Lord to heal him of it and he consulted him three times. But what did the Lord say? My grace is sufficient." Paul &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Then I will glory in my infirmities." when he got an answer from the Lord, he took the answer from the Lord. He didn't go back and ask, okay, the Lord gave him that answer and then he took it because he said, "Except I would be exalted above the abundance of revelation, there was given to me a messenger of the devil, a thorn in the flesh that buffet me, he'd get better for a while and then away they'd go again." Brother Steve preached on us about two years ago about blow after blow. If you remember, buff it means blow after blow. Like the ship on the seas, you know, the waves buffet at sea blow after blow. He would get better. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever experienced this in your in your walk, in your life, physically, spiritually, mentally, whatever it might be, he'd get better and then he'd have it again. And then he'd get better and have it again. He said, "Lord, what's the matter? You don't take this away from me." And he said, "My grace is sufficient." Paul, just keep on. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Now, if if I was just perfect and everything was perfect and I would go along saying, "Oh, I'd get puffed up and say, you see, there's nothing wrong with me. Lord takes care of me, brother." Hallelujah. Then you're getting self-righteous. &gt;&gt; Man, it's like if you're if you're if you're over here on this side, it's not a good thing. But if then you're over here on this side, it's also not a good thing. The Lord knows exactly where to keep us. God has to give you a little something. Where is it coming from? It's coming from God. As we heard Sunday, don't take it personally. Seek out if it's coming from God. Give you something a little once in a while to kind of meaken you up a little bit. You know, that's right. Kind of make you realize that he's the boss. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; You say, you know, I would say this, well, Lord, I realize you're the boss without you giving me this, but not according to the word. I wouldn't do it. I may be in a little situation, but really to know that he's the boss, which mean he has preeminence over my life. If I forgot to set a timer here, I'm going to set one just so I know we have a uh prayer afterwards. Amen. I'll read you another one. It says, "We notice Paul." Now, I I I just want I didn't disagree with brother Aaron when he was here, but I I started to think about that statement. I said, you know, I've kind of thought that I thought that same thing. You know, I don't have that great revelation. I don't I don't equal myself to Paul or and I don't think we compare ourselves to people in the Bible. You know, we we read the stories, but it's really hard to put yourself in Moses's shoes or Paul's shoes or somebody's shoes. But yet, &gt;&gt; that's not really the right mentality to have because the right mentality is listen, if I'm God and I've been part of this revelation to this person that you're reading about. I am God and I change not. And if you fall under the same exact anointing and bride that these people fell under, you actually have not only that revelation, but in our time, we have a greater &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; You say a greater revelation. Yes, a greater revelation because right now as we know there, this is the full manifestation of the word today. &gt;&gt; There is nothing hid. There is nothing that yet has yet to be revealed. we have the full manifestation of the word. So I don't want to have the attitude or the mindset of well I just have this little simple revelation. No, that's the devil trying to get you off of the thing that God has given you. &gt;&gt; Many times I thought that, oh well, I'm just a little simple this and that. Well, where is that coming from? &gt;&gt; Now I'm simple. My mind is simple. The way I think is simple. But the God that lives inside my heart is not simple. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so if if I I I I just I don't want to be guilty of having a uh what is it? A scarcity mindset &gt;&gt; where I'm going to live under my privilege, not because I am anything good, but because he gave to me something that makes me privileged. &gt;&gt; It I it it lifts me to a spot that I could never lift myself. But with it comes something else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So he says this. Now, what is this great revelation that Paul had? If if if you were to say, I I sit down and write down the great revelation that Paul had, we might come up with maybe 40 or 50 different things that was Paul's great revelation, right? Maybe it would fill books. But let's just let's just I love that the Lord is is he's the most complex, complicated being ever, and yet hides himself and reveals himself in simplicity. There there's a saying and I it's it's not from the message. It's from a man who says the modern man does not find God because he doesn't look low enough. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; We make him into something so great and complicate which he is great. But yet that's not how he chose to reveal himself. And so he says this, brother Ram says, "And when their eyes were open, they knew him in 64." He says, "We notice then Paul the great revelation that he had of Jesus Christ who he was. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You're like, "Wait a minute. That's the great revelation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But but he says here, "It was so great to know." &gt;&gt; Truth. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And if you think, "Well, wait a minute. I know who he is." &gt;&gt; Then you have the revelation that Paul had. &gt;&gt; But do you really know who he is? See, it's not just, well, I know what his name is. I know what he came and did. I know about him. I think we were talking about this. I could read uh I I could read uh uh brother John I could read an autobiography about you. Maybe you would write it even yourself and you would say here's my and I could read that book and I would know about you. &gt;&gt; But I wouldn't know you until I met you, until I talked with you. I see how you speak, how you smile, how your eyes change even when you're saying something I would just know about you. And many people know about God, &gt;&gt; but they don't know him. &gt;&gt; And so, it's a great revelation, he says, to know. I got to keep moving here because I got um I hope it's okay, but I got maybe a a lot of hay on the cart. Well, God put it in the Bible. That's how great it was. That's the reason he was given a thorn in the flesh. That's the That's the reason he says to keep him down so he wouldn't get big and exalted. God kept him down and small so he could use him in different parts of the country to do for him what he wanted to do because he had the revelation of Jesus Christ who he was. &gt;&gt; I say okay that that that makes sense. Uh I I know sometimes it gets a little bit scary. Now wait a minute. If I h if I say I have that same revelation I just we read the scripture. Now what is going to come with it? And that's what I want to talk about is because of the great revelation given to you. Even if you didn't realize what great revelation that you have, you definitely recognize the trials. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; You definitely recognize persecution. I I would hope that everybody here is has gone through or is going through something &gt;&gt; and you and you have total reliance on the Lord to bring it through. You say, "Now, why did that happen?" And and a lot of times I just want to I just want to kind of knock this out of the way right now. A lot of times I get under uh trial or persecution or you do or we see somebody else going under persecution. We see somebody else sick or we see somebody else going through a trial and a lot of times in our mind I I immediately think something has gone wrong. &gt;&gt; There must be something wrong somewhere. &gt;&gt; We see somebody maybe in financial trouble. I don't I'll just I'll just confess. Have you ever thought, "Oh, I wonder if they made bad financial decision. Maybe maybe I know you've never thought this. Maybe they didn't pay offering and tithe correctly and now this is this is reaping." Now I I I just I'll confess maybe maybe my own uh incorrect thinking has led me to those thoughts. &gt;&gt; But what you know a lot of times when we see that there there's a there's in the Bible Jesus and disciples came across a man who was blind. And the first thing the disciples asked Jesus was who sinned? &gt;&gt; The father or the mother? And Jesus says this, I'll just read this out of this quote. He says, "It's up to him that believed." Do you remember the blind man that Jesus found? They said, "Who sinned? His father or his mother?" And he said, "In this case, neither &gt;&gt; but that the works of God might be made known." See, it happened to the boy so that Jesus could be glorified. Lord, &gt;&gt; sometimes sickness is not a curse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not my word. That's right out of the message. Sometimes sickness is not a curse. &gt;&gt; It's a blessing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A blessing to be sick. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Now, wait a minute. A blessing to be sick. Let's just read what he says. so that we can stick out our our faith out there and call those things which are not as though they were. God said so and he'll prove it so if you'll just not weaken under the test. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Instead of looking at the situation with our human reasoning, which is really hard not to look at a situation our own or somebody else's, whatever it might be, and apply the human reasoning to it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. And maybe our intention is good. Brother Brandon, Brother Brandham even said this early on in his ministry. He said when he would go into a city, he would issue a challenge. He said, and he said, "Bring your sick. Bring your crippled. Bring them here." And before the end of this meeting, they will be healed. &gt;&gt; And he said he he did that for a long time until the Lord dealt with them. &gt;&gt; And the Lord says this, quote, "You're confining too much of that gift of healing to performing miracles. And he goes on, the Lord goes on to tell him, "Have you ever consulted me first?" &gt;&gt; Did you ever consult me before you prayed for those people? &gt;&gt; Oh boy. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. &gt;&gt; What a question. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes God allows something to happen just so he can get the glory out of it when he straightens the thing out the way he wants to straighten the thing out. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we see somebody in church who's maybe going through some bad times. Maybe it's ourselves. Maybe uh you see they kind of take miss a few church services here and there or you see maybe personal life falling apart or maybe their children stop serving the Lord or maybe their business starts going downhill. I'm just going to name a bunch of symptoms because uh you know maybe their you know they used to praise the Lord real loudly and worship and now they're real quiet. Maybe their amen is real quiet. It's not as loud as it used to be. Do you ever see somebody going through that even if it's yourself and think something has gone wrong here? Sure. There must be some they must have some kind of thing going on. I don't mean in a bad way, but sometimes we go, man, I'm just going to pray for them. Something they must have some sin. Now, listen. Sin can be the reason for this sometimes. Can we can we just approach? Sin can be the reason I'm going through something personally, a trial or persecutions, right? It can be that. But all the time sin is not the reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the time sin is not the reason. And it just said in that quote, "Sickness &gt;&gt; is not always a curse." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, because if we if we start to think like that, if I start to think like that, then I'm exactly like the friends of Job. Because Job had every single one of those symptoms I just told you about. His finances fell apart. His children died. He lost his house. He lost his spouse. He didn't know what to do. He lost his personal health. And his friends came around to say, "There must be something going on in Job's life. Tell us, Job, what is it? What is that secret sin that's going on?" And Job said, "I've examined my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've examined it according to the word, and I don't have anything that I'm hiding. So, you can accuse me all you want to, but I've put I I've I've sought the Lord because I know him. I've sought the Lord and you can you can accuse me this all you want, but there's nothing in my life that I haven't told him about. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we confuse sometimes I confuse my trials for sin. &gt;&gt; And listen, here's here's the other side. Sometimes I can I I I I confuse my sin with trials. Oh, I'm going through this thing because the Lord's testing me. No, I'm going through that because I made a wrong decision. Because I have the wrong spirit, because I have the wrong mentality. Because I've allowed something to come in and make me think a certain way. I might be going through a trial for those reasons. Let's not confuse sin with God saying, "I'm going to put you through something to mold your character to make you who I want you to be." I've heard I I I've I've probably have said this, but like, "Oh, well, I have a bad temper or I'm I'm stubborn. That's just my thorn in the flesh." No, &gt;&gt; no, it's not a thorn in the flesh. That's just characteristics that are not godly that God's going to do everything in his power to get rid of. &gt;&gt; So Job Job said, "Accuse all you want to. I know where I stand." See, but that the sin was not the cause in Job's life. It was not the cause for the thorns. He was given a thorn. The prophet of God said that what was perfect about Job, he says that he had a perfect revelation of who God was. Doesn't that sound familiar? That sounds exactly like the revelation that we're talking about Paul has. &gt;&gt; He knew who God was. He knew that he could He knew that his life was not perfect. No, because he had to go make sacrifices in the temple. But he knew that there was only one way to commune with God and that was through blood. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Before Jesus ever came and was died, he knew that it had to be a blood sacrifice in order to have And so, but what he struggled with, you know, Job had a struggle. And what he had a struggle with, brother Bram says this was the mark on his life. &gt;&gt; He said what he struggled with and and mostly what I struggled with is he wanted to know why. &gt;&gt; He even said Lord I demand &gt;&gt; you answer me. &gt;&gt; Why is this happening to me? And right there is the mistake. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; It's a mistake. to seek out why you're going through what you're going through it. No, it's a mistake to ask the Lord, why are you doing this? Because that goes back to Sunday. Now, you've made a conflict. I've made a conflict with God when I demand an answer out of him. And the way he answered Job is perfect. Oh, you want an answer? Buckle up &gt;&gt; because I'm going to ask you some questions and see if you I'm going to demand of you an answer and see if you can answer. How do you and where you could go through that whole book of Job? You know what he was asking him? H if you how do you you're going to ask me my reasons? You don't even see all these things I have going on. &gt;&gt; Why did I do this? Why did I do this? Why did I make this? Why did I create this? If you don't know those, why are you asking me why I'm doing what I'm doing in your life? &gt;&gt; And maybe maybe just maybe Job Job caught a revelation which he did and he said, "You know what? I know my redeemer liveth if he destroys me. &gt;&gt; See what happened? It wasn't just words. He got to a revelation where he said, "Oh, oh, this thing that I'm going through. Oh, if it kills me, I'll still trust in him." &gt;&gt; Oh, this thing that I'm going through, even though I've lost everything, oh, maybe it's not a curse. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's a blessing. &gt;&gt; A blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; His wife told him to curse God. And he's over here blessing God by the end of the book for put I I I just And here I go through my little things. &gt;&gt; And I and I demand an answer from God. &gt;&gt; That's the mistake. &gt;&gt; I say, "Why am I going through these things?" And I look at Job's life. I'm not going through what Job went through. And yet, I'm not trying to trivialize our our tests and trials. All right. But how many times have you ever demanded an answer from the Lord? How many times has your prayer my prayer been Lord take this thing away from me rather &gt;&gt; than say Lord is this from you &gt;&gt; you saying do I need to put up with sicknesses do I need to put up with these things let me just read you something brother Bram says but first your motives and object objectives has to be right &gt;&gt; you have to re you have to have reasons for this God don't give you those things just because you ask. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that to be in the will of God. See, if you want to be well, what do you want to be well for? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just about going to God like he's a butler and saying, "Lord, here's what I want today." He wants you to seek out, "Well, wait a minute. Why do you want me to?" And this right in the message. See, if you want to be healed, what's the reason you want to be healed? &gt;&gt; What are you telling God? What do you want to do with your life when you get healed? Or is the prayer and and the and and the sincere request of the heart just to be healed? And God's God can do it &gt;&gt; and sometimes he will do it. But then sometimes you get buffeted and then it comes back again and then the thing goes away and then it comes back again. See, there's you've got to have a motive and an objective, and they have to be right according to the will of God. That's when the faith is revealed to you. And God by his sovereign grace places that faith in there, then it's over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not telling you that sickness is something that you need to put up with. I'm telling you, seek out what the Lord thinks about it, what God thinks about it. &gt;&gt; I don't know how to make that. I think that's just I'll just leave that right there because the word of God, what it is, we were discussing this the other night. Uh my wife and I were discussing this. The word of God calls us to have a higher a higher view of the situation. Okay? So, revelation and you know this, but I just want to go through this revelation when you receive revelation from God, it is not a download of information. &gt;&gt; No. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So it's not this I didn't know this and then he he just like and now I have all this knowledge right because now it becomes about knowledge. It becomes about how much you know how much you can retain how much you can remember. No no that's not revelation from God. What a revealing is is God giving you a little glimpse &gt;&gt; of how he sees the situation. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said that when he saw that vision he goes I didn't do anything. It was like he picked me up. &gt;&gt; I was looking through the little hole in the fence. He goes, "But it it was like he picked me up so that I could see the whole picture &gt;&gt; from his point of view." &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; And then he would come off of it. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's brother Brandham." I'm sorry, but it's unfettered revelation that is given to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If that was just for brother Brandham, then then we should just go and and and be merry and live every way we want because brother Brandham is the only one. No, that's an example. But greater work shall you do. &gt;&gt; I know this is just kind of basic, but it's God's point of view. And then if you look at yourself from God's point of view, you don't look at your trials and your persecutions the same way, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You don't look at them the same way. See, Paul got to that point after seeking and seeking and seeking and finally the Lord said, "Let me show you from my point of view." And then Paul said, "Oh, &gt;&gt; okay. Instead of asking to be relieved of it, I'm going to glory &gt;&gt; in my infirmities." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I get sick, if I get persecuted, I'm going to praise you even more &gt;&gt; because he got a he was just allowed a little view from God's perspective on the situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and you have to have that. How could Job look at losing his children, looking at all this stuff and still serve God? How could he do that unless he got a revelation of God about what that you know James I think the first chapter or second verse of James says this brethren count it all joy. &gt;&gt; Now I just want to stop there. All joy not you know a good feeling that lasts from church service to church service or meeting to meeting. all joy, which means anything that you have joy about from God in your life, count it. The word count says judge it. What he's saying is you're going to go through a situation, you need to judge that situation properly, and you need to have all joy. Now, read the rest of the verse. And it doesn't say have all joy when the Lord delivers you, &gt;&gt; when the Lord heals you, when the Lord saves you, when the No, no, no, no. It says, "Count it all joy when you fall into persecutions, into diverse temptations." &gt;&gt; Joy. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Joy for temptations. Oh, yeah. That's how a child of God looks at it. When they're when they're when they're allowing God to give them his view of the scenario. If I look at it through my scenario, though I believe I'm a child of God, I will complain. I will murmur. or or maybe out of sincerity, I will ask the Lord to relieve me of it without seeking out his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyone, and we all have to come to that realization. We have to come to that realization because what Job did is he just said, "Look, I I I I know I'm going through this, but there must be something so great in store for me that this is going to provide a balance for it." &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And and that that leads me to something. I'm if I'm okay on I've been about 20 minutes about 22 minutes. Uh balance. Can I just talk to you about balance for a moment because I think it's crucial in this balance. Now uh I don't mean balance. You know when I hear balance, what do you think of? &gt;&gt; The middle evenness. I think of a little bit too much to the left or a little bit too much to the right. And when you get the right amount, the scale, it's balance. You're right down the middle of the road. Let's talk about a different type of balance. And and the only way I express this is I I've told this only one time and it was a it's a uh well it's a testimony of kinds, but it's more of an experience. And so uh I know there's some of you that have um operated heavy equipment. I wish brother Jerry was here because he'd really probably appreciate this. So when I was young, I was like uh I was 16 years old. I worked for a heavy equipment um uh dealer. So, I just drove the equipment around on the in the yard and I parked it and I washed it and all these things. I didn't really operate it, but I was learning. And so, there was a day that came where a a a semitr showed up and it had a huge load on it and are we good? Should I switch to this? Not that you need to hear me anymore, but it all right. I'm gonna tell this anyway. So, okay. The man that that that normally unloaded this trailer, he was uh he was at a doctor's appointment and the backup guy was uh I think he was at lunch. And so, I'm like 16 years old and this trailer pulls up and it has this huge load. It's 15,000 pounds. So, it wasn't a small thing. And um you know, the semi-truck driver's like, I I need this unloaded. I don't know when this guy's coming back. So, me as this young kid, I was like, I'm gonna here's my chance. Like, this is my time to shine. And I really did. I was just like, "Oh, yeah. I know. I know what I'm doing. I've operated the equipment. I've driven it around. I've operated the crane." So, I go set up my crane. I got my I'm trying to make this fast, but I really want to drive home this point. I set up my outriggers. I looked at my thing. Oh, it's rated for uh it was like rated for 16,000 lbs. I'm picking up like 15,00 I'm good. You probably know where this is going. Brother Bob is probably know where this is going as well. Okay. So, I I get my load down. I get everything. I get it all hooked up and the and the driver goes off and he's chatting with some guy. So, he's not watching me. So, I'm really really alone on this. And I pick up the the the load and sure enough comes right off and I'm checking everything. Okay, I'm good. And then this is where it goes wrong. Where am I going to put this? And because I didn't have experience and because I didn't have knowledge, because I didn't know things, I thought, "Oh, well, there's a there's a spot right on the other side of the trailer." And so, I'll just swing this out and I'll put it there. Yeah. You know where it's going because that weight right here, it can pick it up. But as soon as it moves away, &gt;&gt; it gets exponentially heavier. And this machine could not hold it the more I swung out. And then I got to a point where it was too late. It was too late. I couldn't I couldn't go forward. I couldn't come back. Nobody's out there. I I go to step off the truck and just my weight leaving the truck and it wants to like tilt. So I'm like in a I'm in a bind. And I did probably the worst thing you could do was like, "Well, I'm just going to commit to this, Brother Donald, and I'm just going to like I'm going to go." And it was only the grace of God. I mean that the the crane started to tilt and I went forward but I was low enough to the ground where the the the load hit the ground. The crane didn't flip. I say all that. That's the type of balance that I'm talking about in this particular scenario. That's the type of balance. I didn't have enough counterweight in order to do the task that I needed to do. And if you're going to do anything of consequence for the Lord, &gt;&gt; if you're going to do anything for the Lord, even if you're I'm not saying you have to go and have a ministry or you have to go and do this. If you're going to do anything for the Lord, even live for the Lord, &gt;&gt; okay? It's going to require that you reach out farther than you've ever reached before. I you I don't know if that if that if that sinks in, but I cannot just be a casual believer of the gospel. I can't just go, well, I was I was one way this day and then the Lord changed me, but but I'm still kind of this way. &gt;&gt; No, it's going to require that I do things that I've never done before because the Lord's the one doing them. So, it's going to require that I reach out farther. And if you don't have a counterwe, it's going to be like I don't know if any other kids ever sat on a seessaw when you're by yourself. How much fun is that? This is Liberty. You ever sat on a seesaw without somebody on the other side? It's just called sitting. &gt;&gt; You have to have something on the other end, right? You have to have something on the other end because and you have to have a counterbalance. And let me tell you this, this is hard to hear, but the counterbalance has to be as heavy at least as what you're trying to do for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, there's going to be problems. &gt;&gt; You're going to try to do something for the Lord, and then you're going to all of a sudden find yourself lost, out of church, uh depressed, whatever it might be, because there has to be a counterbalance. Because even the because listen, the weakness of my flesh, all this revelation that's given to us, right? We're talking about this. But the weakness of your flesh and my flesh and the the way that this works sometimes demands that there must be a counterbalance to that revelation. &gt;&gt; It demands that there must be a counterbalance to it. We know the word has come full. We we we we know these things. But because of that, there has to be a thorn. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, &gt;&gt; there was given to you and to me thorns to provide a counterbalance for the revelation that God has either given you and sometimes we don't realize yet or is going to give you and we don't realize that sometimes or sometimes you realize exactly what he's given you. You know who God is. And then sometimes I know exactly who Jesus is, who God is and I still ask why. And when I come back to the Bible, he says, "Because you would be exalted above measure because of this great revelation." And if it weren't for thorns, we would get puffed up, egotistical, prideful, self-righteous, and we would be no good to God even with an abundance of revelation. &gt;&gt; So what he has to do, he has to do it &gt;&gt; is give you a thorn in the side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's true. Amen. He has to do it. &gt;&gt; And we can say amen to this. But what about when the thorn comes? &gt;&gt; What about when it comes? What about when the sickness strikes? I tell you every I I could read this and I know this and then it comes and I and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is why. You can wrestle with it. You can fight at it. You can pick at it and get it all festered up or you can just, you know, we get sometimes we even get depressed or anxious trying to figure out why I have a thorn in my life &gt;&gt; because the thought goes back there must be something wrong. something must have gone. And and I think sometimes we have problems in our walk with the Lord, our relationship, because we spend so much time and effort and worry and stress trying to figure out what the thorn is and why we have it. &gt;&gt; I know I I know I do. I know who God is. But if there's a stress in my relationship with him, it's because I put it there trying to figure out why I'm going through what I'm going through. How many times have I prayed to the Lord to remove something that he put there to begin with? And maybe God is telling us that we need to understand that there are things that we will not understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are things you're not going to understand why you're going through what you're going through. simply this that he gets the glory whether it be on this side or the other side. Brother Ram says, you know, he may even commit you to death like he did Paul, but he still gets the glory. He may commit you, brother Ram says, to suffer like Job, but it's for his purpose, his reasoning, not mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not it's not my reasoning. Oh Lord, you know, give me a trial until the trial comes. I don't know. I just I telling myself a little bit, but I want to have and the bride will have. I want to have it. That correct spirit says, "Lord, I see the thorn. I don't know why it's there. But I know you must have allowed it." And there if you've allowed it, then it must be a reason. Why don't we go take that thorn, use it as a counterbalance, and go get the work of the Lord done that we couldn't have done without that counterbalance. That's true. &gt;&gt; Just go get the work of I don't know what that is. If maybe you have family members, maybe you have a loved one that just is so far from the Lord and you say, "Well, I'm going to go and I'm going to I'm going to talk with them. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to minister to them." Maybe not in a minister, but in order to reach out and grab somebody, you have to have some suffering back here, some pain back here. In order for you to reach out, there has to be an equal, heavy, hard, dark sometimes counterbalance in order for you to go get the work of the Lord done. This is not just for ministers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. This is just not for ministers. Well, that's for the minister's job. And if he wants to go preach, you know, the minister. No, I'm sorry. How many times have you been in a service? How many times have you sought the Lord and you want a closer walk with him or something's come along? Usually around the new time, you know, new year. I'm going to pray more this year. I'm going to read my Bible more this year. I'm going to do this more this year. Where did that come from? It's a revelation from God. And yet to accomplish it, there must be a counterbalance. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Anybody that's done something for the Lord has had a thorn in their side. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just look through the the Bible is literally just It's not a book of of what has happened. It's a book of what always happens. &gt;&gt; What always happens? Everybody that's done something for the Lord, Moses, David, Elijah, we could go through every single one of those. Elijah had a thorn in his side. You know what the thorn in his side was? It was Jezebel. We're talking about the most mighty man on the face of the earth. And when Jezebel threatened him, he ran. This is somebody who who could call fire from heaven. Stay with me now on this on the spiritual thing because because he did not get to see Jezebel defeated and killed. &gt;&gt; He prophesied it. He knew it would happen. But in his lifetime, he had to deal with that thorn. And he was never relieved of it. &gt;&gt; It came a decade later in the life of Elisha. If we keep our spiritual caps now, Brother Brandham, Brother Brandham fought against Jezebel religion, let's just get down to the nitty-gritty. He fought against a a Jezebel religion, a religion being taken over by the cold formal church &gt;&gt; where you just come to the priests and confess your sins, go through your little routine, come to your church service every now and then. He fought against that &gt;&gt; and never got to see the victory against it. But it comes in my day. It comes in my day. The manifestation of his ministry through Elisha. It comes in my day that I get to see that the defeat of a Jezebel spirit. The same exact spirit that was on a woman is just on the religious. I I know we know this, &gt;&gt; but a thorn in his side that he was never relieved of. I I have a few examples if that's okay. I didn't really know where to go, but I just want to talk. Can I talk about Joseph? I got I got uh it says 12 minutes if I'm doing okay. &gt;&gt; Joseph uh Joseph had so many things of God in his life going for him. &gt;&gt; He was shown dreams as a young man. As a young man, he saw his brothers bowing before him. &gt;&gt; And he told them that maybe out of immaturity. Maybe he shouldn't have shared it with them, but he told them. &gt;&gt; And what did they do? They got they got jealous. They got angry with him. And they started persecuting him. &gt;&gt; They they they they beat him up. They throw him into a a pit or a ditch on the side of the road down in the hole, right? You know what that was? That was a thorn. &gt;&gt; And then it didn't stop there. They pull him out. When they when when the slave carts of Egypt start rolling by, they pull him out and they go, "Well, I guess we won't kill him. We'll sell him." You know what that was? That was another thorn. But God with him the whole time. &gt;&gt; The whole time God's with him. And then he goes to Egypt and it looks like maybe he's through the persecution, right? But here's the buffeting, a messenger of Satan again. And all of a sudden he's falsely accused in the house of potterer. How many times have you been falsely accused and you want to know why? I just that that was maybe a little bit for me. Maybe somebody said something about me and the first thing I want to go do is confront them about it. Why are you saying this about me? Why are you spreading this about me? Why you doing that? And yet Joseph didn't say nothing. Went to jail because he knew that God was with him. &gt;&gt; You see a heart, his heart was kept right. His spirit was kept right. And guess what? In in the dungeon, have you ever been in the dungeon? Maybe you're in the dungeon right now in your mind, &gt;&gt; in your heart, &gt;&gt; in your prayer life, whatever it might be. Maybe you're in the dungeon. But guess what? His heart stayed true to God. And even in the dungeon, his gift was still operating. Even in your dungeon, guess what? Uh you say, "Well, what gift do I have?" We're all given gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't you look and see if your gift is operating when you're down in that trial? Oh, maybe the trial is not from Satan. Maybe it's a blessing. Maybe it's a it's not a curse. and he he talks to somebody and he interprets his dreams and he tells them, "Look, I'm kind of in I'm going through it right now." &gt;&gt; Like, I'm going through it right now. I I got a thorn right now, but when you get to the the the Pharaoh's would you remember me? Would you tell him about me? I'm going through it right now. I don't know why I'm going through it, but I know it must be from the Lord. And why did he go? But see what happened was all that time and we know this. This is just basic Bible stuff. But it's just good to review this. It's good to think about this. It was just the Lord molding his character all the way through. Oh, there's a little part. You know, Brother Ram says that Joseph was perfect &gt;&gt; except he had something on his life. &gt;&gt; He was ashamed &gt;&gt; of who he was. &gt;&gt; Don't tell them Don't tell them that we uh heard sheep. Don't tell them that we're ministers of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Don't tell them that we're message believers. Tell them we're some Tell them we're just good church people. &gt;&gt; How many times have I been ashamed of what I believe and yet he said that was a mark on his life. But his attitude stayed right. His mind stayed right and he was being reproached. &gt;&gt; But he didn't curse God. &gt;&gt; And then he was delivered out of it into second to the Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; And and then we say, "Oh, you know, the Lord, it's delivering." No, no, no. It's not just a deliverance. I want to tell you something that there is, and I hope that you could catch this statement for what I mean it for. There is a victory that is greater than deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a victory greater than, you know, if you if you pray to God, Lord, I'm sick. I want you to heal me. It's right in the Bible. You can and probably will be healed if your faith can touch God. Yes. Right. Have you been healed before? But if you live long enough, you're going to get sick again. You know, he could even raise you from the dead, physically raise you from the dead, and if you live long enough, and he doesn't come, you're going to die. &gt;&gt; There is a victory that is greater than just him delivering you out of your trials and out of your circumstances. There's a greater greater victory, and that is to see his character taking place in your life, coming to fruition in your life. Because when his brothers came, see if he would approached his brothers back there after they thrown him in the pit, &gt;&gt; he might not have had the right reaction. I believe I believe that he would have reached for the sword. &gt;&gt; Instead, he reaches for grain. &gt;&gt; Grain. &gt;&gt; When he had the chance to get revenge, he didn't take and instead he saved a nation. &gt;&gt; You want to talk about a counterweight? You want to talk about all the things that Joseph went through? Why was it so heavy? Why the ditches? Why the slave carts? Why Potterer's wife? Why the dungeon? Because those things do not stop the plan of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, by those things, the plan of God is carried out. &gt;&gt; Because that gave him the characteristics to say, "When I have the chance to get back at you justly, justly." He could have justly &gt;&gt; thrown them in jail, killed them by the sword, and he would have been justified. He instead saved a nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he, now listen, he could not have done that without a counterweight. He could he he was reach listen Joseph was reaching out to something he never could have reached before unless he had a lot of heartaches, a lot of persecutions. Listen, I read Revelations 5. There was a book in the hand that listen no man was worthy to take. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you this by revelation Jesus was not worthy to take that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No man in heaven no man in earth or under the earth. But see what happened was is Jesus had thorns come into his life so that he could have the proper counterweight so he could walk forward and reach something that he could not have reached before. The thorns, the the the cross, the nails, all those things made him worthy. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; It made him worthy. &gt;&gt; That's why it had to be a lamb. It had to be somebody who went through something. You say through something through the greatest trials and tribulations that a human being can face. That's what he went through. For what? That there was a thorn called Calvary. &gt;&gt; So that he could do Oh man. So he could do something that he could not have done without it. &gt;&gt; He could not have done it without that. That's what I read in the word to to grab somebody. I hope that you could see this. to save you and me who were unsavable. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm not that bad. I wasn't I'm not like so and so." Unsavable. &gt;&gt; You are not savable. &gt;&gt; And he had to do something to reach out that nobody could save you &gt;&gt; unless they were made worthy to save you. &gt;&gt; There had to be a thorn. &gt;&gt; There had to be it. Jesus even goes to the garden and prays, you know, let the I I don't know if I want this and I wonder if God gave him a little viewpoint. Wait a minute. I have a bigger picture in mind. Oh, you know what, Lord? Not my will. &gt;&gt; Not my will. You say, "Not Jesus." If you face it, Jesus faced it. &gt;&gt; If you face a temptation, if you face a thought, an improper thought about what the then Jesus faced it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want I'm not going through anything that God hasn't gone through himself and knows exactly what I'm dealing with, exactly how I think and says, "Now wait a minute. There's a new way to think about this." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There was a counterbalance called Calvary. And you want to do something for God. You want to walk closer to God. You want to live a life for God. You want to reach a place. Listen, if you want to reach a place in God that you've never reached before, you're going to have a thorn. Now, now an illegitimate child, this is what they'll do. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know if I can handle anymore. Maybe I'm just fine right where I'm at with God. &gt;&gt; You know what my I think I talked about this a couple times ago. My ratio of sacrifice to reward is just where I like it. I don't have to give up too much and I'm happy with what I'm getting. The ratio of my service to the Lord is it's just where I like it. It's just where I like it. But a child of God is not satisfied with that. And let me tell you this, God is not satisfied with that either. &gt;&gt; And if he's got to say, "Oh, well, you know, um, you know, there's another example of thorns, like brother Brandham preaches about the nest." Well, if I got to take a few feathers out and you're saying, "Lord, I can't I cannot I cannot handle what you're going through." And he says, "You can't handle it. &gt;&gt; You can handle it because you're my child and I will get you through." &gt;&gt; And you say, "Oh, well, that's just so simple." But see, what's going to happen is you think Satan's not going to attack you. You know, here's what Satan's going to do. He's going to come around and say this. And he's and he's and he's done this to every person that's tried to do something for the Lord and is going through a trial. You know, if you were if you were doing things right, this wouldn't be happening to you. &gt;&gt; You know, if if the Lord was really on your side, &gt;&gt; things wouldn't be going bad like this. Why? Because he knows. He knows what that counterbalance is going to give you. &gt;&gt; Because he's the tool that God uses a lot of times to give you that counterbalance. Do you know how many victories Satan has seen happen in people's life? I I you know I just You know why I love testimonies? Because we get to rub it in the face &gt;&gt; of the one being put on this earth to stop us from doing the thing that God allowed us to do. We get to say, "You know what, Satan? Despite all the things you put me through and all the thoughts you put in my head and all those things, I still was brought through by the Lord." That's what testimonies are. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord still did this to me. &gt;&gt; And and Satan will say, "Oh, yeah, but look at what you're going through. Oh, you you're serving the Lord and yet your family's falling apart. You're serving the Lord and yet you've lost this. You've lost businesses. You've lost money. You've lost houses. You've lo whatever it might be. You lost reputation. You've lost all those things. But I've gained a revelation like no other has had until this time. &gt;&gt; I've gained more than I've lost. If if you want to destroy this flesh, listen. Now you can see Job's mentality. Oh, no. No. Satan, though you destroy this body, the skin worms can eat this. I'm still going to praise the Lord. I'm still going to thank him. If you kill me, I'm still going to trust in the Lord. If God himself comes down and kills me, I'm still going to trust in the Lord. Why? Because I've caught a view from his eyes. &gt;&gt; I've caught a a little perspective of what my life looks like through the eyes of God, a real revelation. See, that is a perfect revelation. And if you have that perfect revelation, don't think that you're not going to get a trial. But you know what? I love my alarm's going off here. I've been 45 minutes. Can I have like can I have five minutes? When I when I when I hear testimony, when I when I see Sister Kathleen raise her hand and give a testimony, I think, man, that's exactly what God was looking for. &gt;&gt; When I see Sister Liz raise her hand and give a testimony about her health, that's exactly what God was looking for. And you say, "Why did he put me through this? Why did he put me through this?" because then he brought you out of it. And if we have the the the the the mindset that's correct, we'll say, "Lord, oh, now now I see the purpose of it." And you know what? Maybe maybe some of us don't get that victory. Maybe some of us go to the grave. But you know what? I believe with all my heart, I'll still raise up on that day and say, "Lord, thank you for sending me to the grave. Thank you for sending me to the grave because I never would have had I would never would have made it in you unless you did that for me." There has got to be a counterbalance behind you. Listen, trials and persecutions are not failures. &gt;&gt; Sickness is not always a curse. Sometimes it's a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I failed again. How do you know it's not the Lord just putting another small stone in the counterwe? &gt;&gt; Oh, well, wait a minute. But I made a mistake. But yet, your footsteps are ordered by the Lord. If I made a mistake, if he's really in charge of my life, doesn't he know the mistakes I'm going to make? &gt;&gt; Oh man, my son, he's going to do this again and he's going to go off. He doesn't even know it. I'm going to use that for his own good. You know what? He's going to have a reach with somebody in his family. He's going to have a reach over here that he never would have had unless he makes mist. Oh. Oh, just wait till he sees my point of view of his life and how I took that wrong thing that was wrong and I turned it around &gt;&gt; for his own benefit. And if listen, if he did it with Jesus, his son, is he going to do it with you? Is he going to do it with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, he's going to do it. &gt;&gt; I I got I better stop. I'm going to read this. He says in three kinds of believers, you've got something to do. I cannot sit on the sidelines and say, "Well, you know, I'm just happy where I'm at. I'm just h" And I'm not saying that we say those words, but I'm sorry. I'm not happy with the ratio of sacrifice to reward. I I'm not happy with it. If it costs me everything, and and here's a news flash. It's going to cost you everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? So, there's no surprises down the road. It's going to cost you everything, but you gain everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, who would want to take that? &gt;&gt; Who would want to take that deal? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. We We got a couple. That's a hard That's a hard thing, right? Because, Brother Donald, that's as equal as saying the song, "Whatever it takes." &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; I know we've talked about this. That's a hard song. Oh, whatever it takes, Lord, to be more like you. That's what I'm willing to do. How many can sing that song &gt;&gt; and mean every word? Because what you're doing, you're saying, "Lord, I accept like Jesus, I accept the thorn. I accept the trials." Not only do I accept them, I glory in them. &gt;&gt; In fact, when you bring them, it's my joy. &gt;&gt; It's my joy to go through persecution. You've got something to do. God's got something for you to do. You may have some heartaches and some troubles. Some people's look and are a little bit worse than some others, but we're all going through it. I may not go what you go through, and you may not go what I go through. &gt;&gt; But listen, when you hurt, I hurt. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; If we're in the same body, if we have that spirit of Christ, and when I hurt, I hope you hurt. &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen. You may have some disappointments, but do we pray to shun them? A coward does. &gt;&gt; I've been a coward. &gt;&gt; I've been a coward. &gt;&gt; I've prayed, "Lord, I I don't want this. Lord, I can't handle this." No. Lord, take me through them. Whatever they is, whatever it is, don't let me escape them if they're set for me. Just give me the grace to go through that. &gt;&gt; You know what? I said I'd take five minutes and that was five minutes. I I I just forget these notes. I had like four more pages. I think that that is sufficient. I maybe you don't see the tie in with Sunday, but for me it was it was so stark just when he was brother Steve was preaching about I believe I I believe it was the Lord about when I'm going through something. Why do I take it personal? Why do I feel immediately that either someone's attacking me or that the Lord's attacking? That's exactly what the devil wants me to think &gt;&gt; because now there's a conflict between me and the one who's trying to get me to a place that I never could reach unless he puts me through that. And so I I just think um I think that's sufficient. I think there's one scripture 1 Peter 5:10. But the grace, but the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Not it's after you have suffered a while. Make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand. I pray I didn't I didn't mean to shout out you. I just get I didn't used to get this excited about the word, but I get so excited about the word of God. &gt;&gt; I know that sounds bad, but in my mind, I I it was an intellectual conception, but when I see words coming to life off the pages, I just get excited about it. And I I hope that it's never taken personally. I'm I'm more yelling at myself because, man, I need a pep talk every once in a while. I need to remember this. Uh, you know, Wednesday, we just heard about it, but what about Thursday? What about Friday? What about Saturday? When the when the when the buffeting comes, when the blow comes, blow after blow. This has to be a revelation. It has to drop down. It's good words. We can say, "Amen." But when it drops down, you are invincible. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You are invincible. It doesn't even mean that something can't happen to you. Right? &gt;&gt; There's something on the inside that cannot be killed. It cannot be touched. Destroy this body. I don't care what's I don't care what God wants to destroy. It's going to be burned up anyways. &gt;&gt; But he has a new one waiting for me. Amen. Brother Steve, if you want to come, I'll just keep going if you don't come up here soon. Amen. God bless you. I think we should sing whatever it takes. And we should Because after that it's like now you can sing it with a little more faith to accept it. And see that's why you just preach whatever put the Lord puts on your heart and that's why you just preach under inspiration. And it's okay. Brother Bam said, "Hey, you know, next Sunday I'm going to be preaching on whatever he did that." And then a lot of Sundays he would do it. And some Sundays you'll notice he didn't. Some Sundays he went a different route. So that's why you follow the leading of the Lord, the inspiration because it's timely. It's very timely. We'll take requests after we sing this baby. Oh, whatever it takes to draw closer to you, Lord. That's what I'll be forever for my will to pray. That's what I'm doing. those lacking little faith. I got my will to break. I'm going to break through this time. It takes to draw closer to you, Lord. That's what I'll be willing to do for whatever it takes for my will to pray. That's what I'm willing to do. Praise the Lord. Sister Paul, you have a list up there. Maybe we could look at Cororum. We see Sister Cory Zachair Ruth Kurt ment. Oh, that was the other one. She rose some dental work. I believe there could tomorrow we have Bible study. Brother Ray and Sister Kathy is at 8 o'clock. I know it's supposed to snow. We'll announce it. I'm sorry. Did I say 8? Tomorrow's the 8th. We'll do it at 7 o'clock. On the 8th. At 7 o'clock. Okay. All right. Any other prayer requests? Okay. We'll have Sister Pauline put these up there so we can refer to them. Brother, I was going to say, Brother Tim, sister Mary's back there helping us with the sound today. Sister Mary, if you could put a song on there. We'll go to pray at this time. Lord bless you.
