[48:00] Heat. Heat.
[48:14] The praise is
[48:17] to you,
[48:19] Lord.
[48:22] Jehovah Gyra, my provider, before we
[48:26] turn the service to brother Steve,
[48:30] I've told you many, many times over the
[48:32] years, I sit in the back room and
[48:35] I wait for the Holy Spirit to just
[48:38] change. I see here without being part of
[48:41] anything just but I hear how brother
[48:44] Ryan and the spirit of God is trying to
[48:46] find that avenue and when this song came
[48:49] on
[48:51] I knew in my heart
[48:54] this reset the tone Jehovah Jamis
[48:58] provider.
[48:59] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed
[49:02] be the name of the Lord.
[49:05] Jehovah.
[49:23] Oh,
[49:34] heat,
[49:42] heat.
[49:48] Heat
[49:57] up
[50:04] here.
[50:15] Yeah.
[50:21] Heat.
[50:31] Yeah.
[50:36] Heat.
[50:59] And we bless you this morning. We
[51:00] welcome you to the house of the Lord.
[51:02] And if you're a visitor, I see a couple
[51:04] guests this morning. We just want to
[51:05] welcome you. Not to call your name, uh,
[51:08] but Jesus knows your name. And if you
[51:10] have a need this morning or if you have
[51:11] something you need from him, he's more
[51:14] than able. He's your provider this
[51:16] morning. and he'll provide whatever need
[51:18] you have. I truly believe that. I've
[51:21] seen it. Well, we've already seen it
[51:23] this morning. And um that was a simple
[51:27] need. Sister Cynthia, would you mind
[51:30] giving that testimony? Actually, would
[51:31] that be okay? Would you would you share
[51:33] what you shared with me? If you have a
[51:36] little need, God is able to provide
[51:38] that. If you have a great need, he's
[51:40] able to provide that. You need a piece
[51:42] of paper, he's able to provide that. If
[51:44] you need healing and you're just in just
[51:46] in despair, he's able. Whatever you have
[51:49] need of this morning, we'll just tell
[51:50] this testimony. Let our sister share it
[51:52] and then let it build your faith as you
[51:54] as we present our needs before the Lord
[51:56] in prayer this morning. We'll let this
[51:57] kind of lay the ground for your faith to
[52:00] be built up. Go ahead, sister.
[52:03] um the it's getting towards the end of
[52:05] the year and usually at work um
[52:09] calendars start coming in for from
[52:11] different companies and vendors and um I
[52:14] have a place where I keep a calendar and
[52:17] no calendars have come in this year and
[52:19] so I went to the dollar store and picked
[52:22] one up and it's actually a little bit
[52:24] too big for my space and I looked at my
[52:27] calendar this morning and I said Lord
[52:31] could you just give me a calendar. I
[52:33] would really
[52:35] appreciate a calendar for for my wall.
[52:38] And I know it's small and it's like a
[52:41] simple simple prayer, but I walked in
[52:45] today and got a beautiful calendar from
[52:48] my wall. And I think I've been thinking
[52:51] about it and I thought the Lord had me
[52:55] ask that prayer because he already had
[52:58] the answer. And so, and we know that
[53:03] that a lot of times he answers before we
[53:05] even ask. And
[53:06] &gt;&gt; I think that was why I even asked that
[53:10] simple
[53:11] &gt;&gt; prayer because it was already answered.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We know we have needs
[53:16] this morning. We have Sister Cindy,
[53:19] Brother Glenn, and Sister Karen are
[53:21] traveling. Brother Glenn has needs.
[53:24] Uh, Sister Sakoro comes to mind.
[53:29] Brother Don is in the hospital still.
[53:31] Who am I missing? We have needs.
[53:34] And so just
[53:36] brother back there raised his hand. Just
[53:38] just that little he would even put in a
[53:41] sister's mind to ask a prayer request so
[53:43] that why? Because he already had the
[53:44] answer there ready. And then he wants to
[53:46] manifest how great of a God he is and
[53:49] let us know how great and build our
[53:51] faith this morning because he wants to
[53:53] speak to our hearts. So we remember
[53:54] sister Belle also. Sister Rose that
[53:56] wrote that in and so we want to remember
[53:58] her. I don't I can't name them all. Lift
[54:00] your hand if you have a need and just he
[54:02] might even be having you lift your hand
[54:04] to have a need. So let's go to him in
[54:05] prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we step
[54:08] out of the way this morning, Lord. We
[54:10] step aside and heavenly father, we ask
[54:13] you to come this morning and Lord, we
[54:16] want to sing and we want to praise you
[54:18] and we want to worship you. And all
[54:20] those things are part of a a service
[54:23] Lord to you. A part of a assembly coming
[54:26] together. And Lord, part of that service
[54:28] and part of that coming together is
[54:30] where we would take time to raise our
[54:33] hands and present needs before you,
[54:35] Lord. And but like our sister testified,
[54:38] Lord, we know the answer is already on
[54:40] the way. And it's probably been on the
[54:42] way a long time, Lord. And we just we
[54:44] just haven't seen the fullness of it
[54:46] yet. But we believe it, Lord. We do
[54:48] believe that it's on the way. and it's
[54:50] there and and we claim it for your honor
[54:52] and glory. And so these knees, all these
[54:54] hands that were lifted up, Lord, every
[54:56] name that was spoken, of course, you
[54:58] knew it even before we spoke it, Father,
[55:01] before we come into service this
[55:02] morning, before we even came in here,
[55:04] you knew what the needs would be. You
[55:06] knew how to answer. You already had the
[55:08] answer on the way this morning. And so,
[55:10] let us grab on to that faith, Lord.
[55:12] Would you help our faith? And would you
[55:14] help us to grab on, Lord, where we're
[55:16] failing and where we where we sometimes
[55:18] let Satan get in and distract us. But
[55:20] this morning, Lord, we dedicate
[55:22] ourselves wholly and completely to you.
[55:24] We put all our thoughts aside of the
[55:26] world or what we might have to do
[55:28] tomorrow, the coming days, Lord. And let
[55:30] us in this moment, Lord, we just present
[55:32] ourselves to you, Lord, as living
[55:34] sacrifices. And may you may you come
[55:36] down, Lord, as we've presented the
[55:38] needs. that now Lord, we'd ask also
[55:41] maybe would you speak to our hearts,
[55:43] Lord. Would you use Brother Eli this
[55:44] morning, Lord? And we know he's just a
[55:46] vessel. He's just a man. He's just
[55:48] flesh, Lord. But deep down inside, Lord,
[55:50] I believe before the foundation of the
[55:52] world, you place gifts in the body and
[55:54] and you knew they would be there, Lord.
[55:56] And then you knew where and and how and
[55:57] you would arrange it all and you'd place
[55:59] it and and so this morning, Lord, would
[56:01] you use the gift that's in our brethren?
[56:02] And Father, would you speak to us in a
[56:04] mighty way? Would you would you just
[56:06] pour out your blessings upon us, Father?
[56:08] Wherever there would be a need, the a
[56:10] question in a person's mind, Lord, would
[56:12] you answer that question through the
[56:14] speaking and the ministering of the
[56:16] word, Lord? And and would we go out of
[56:17] here, Father. We'll we'll give you all
[56:19] the glory and the honor and the praise.
[56:21] And we'll say, "Man, didn't our hearts
[56:23] burn within us when he talked with us on
[56:26] that Sunday morning, Lord?" And we'll
[56:28] know it wasn't a man speaking, Lord, but
[56:30] we'll know it was you speaking to our
[56:32] hearts. And so we we claim that for your
[56:34] honor, Lord, for your glory, for for
[56:36] lifting you up this morning, Father,
[56:38] meet every need, Lord, be with our our
[56:40] little program. And may every portion of
[56:42] what the children might do this morning,
[56:44] Lord. Would it all be turned to you? We
[56:46] know we know what the time is, Lord. We
[56:48] know when sheeps are when sheep are
[56:49] born, when lambs are born, Lord, but
[56:51] we're putting aside today to honor the
[56:53] birth of the Lord Jesus Christ. And may
[56:56] everything honor and glorify you this
[56:58] morning. Lord, be with us. We want to
[57:00] tell you we love you. We appreciate you
[57:02] so much. Be with us in Jesus Christ's
[57:04] name we pray. Amen. I believe the Sunday
[57:08] school is ready. So, let's just Brother
[57:10] an will sing that chorus one more time
[57:12] and then I'll step aside and we'll have
[57:15] the children come forward.
[57:28] Oh,
[57:47] heat,
[57:49] heat.
[57:59] Heat. Heat.
[58:10] Yeah.
[58:13] Heat.
[58:30] A
[58:47] Oh,
[58:59] heat,
[59:11] heat.
[59:16] love
[59:18] for
[59:20] me.
[59:26] Let me see.
[1:00:13] That's
[1:01:08] two.
[1:01:25] Luke 2 1-7. And it came to pass in those
[1:01:29] days that there were when out
[1:01:34] And it came to pass in those days that
[1:01:36] there went out a decree from Caesar
[1:01:38] Augustus that all the world should be
[1:01:39] taxed. And this taxing was first made
[1:01:42] when Sirenus was governor of Syria. And
[1:01:45] all went to be taxed. everyone into his
[1:01:47] own city. And Joseph also went up from
[1:01:50] Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
[1:01:52] into Judea, unto the city of David,
[1:01:55] which is called Bethlehem, because he
[1:01:57] was one of the house and lineage of
[1:01:59] David, to be taxed with Mary, his
[1:02:01] espoused wife, being great with child.
[1:02:04] And so it was that while they were
[1:02:06] there, the days were accomplished that
[1:02:09] they should be delivered. And she
[1:02:11] brought him forth her firstborn son, and
[1:02:13] wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and
[1:02:15] laid him in a manger, because there was
[1:02:16] no room for them in the end.
[1:02:24] And there were in the same country
[1:02:26] shepherds abiding in the field, keeping
[1:02:28] watch over their flock by night. And lo,
[1:02:31] the angel of the Lord came upon them,
[1:02:33] and the glory of the Lord shone round
[1:02:35] about them, and they were sore afraid.
[1:02:38] And the angel said unto them, "Fear not,
[1:02:40] for behold, I bring you good tidings of
[1:02:42] great joy, which shall be to all people.
[1:02:45] For unto you is born this day in the
[1:02:47] city of David, a Savior, which is Christ
[1:02:50] the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto
[1:02:52] you, you shall find the babe wrapped in
[1:02:54] swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."
[1:02:57] And suddenly there was with the angel a
[1:02:59] multitude of the heavenly host praising
[1:03:01] God and saying, "Glory to God in the
[1:03:04] highest and on earth peace, good will
[1:03:06] toward men."
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:17] And it came to pass as the angels were
[1:03:19] gone away from them into heaven, the
[1:03:21] shepherds and herds said one to another,
[1:03:25] "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and
[1:03:27] see this thing which has come to pass,
[1:03:29] which the Lord hath made known to us."
[1:03:32] And they came with haste, and found Mary
[1:03:33] and Joseph, and a babe lying in a
[1:03:36] manger. And when they had seen it, they
[1:03:38] had made known abroad, saying which was
[1:03:40] told to them concerning this child.
[1:03:44] And all they that heard it wondered at
[1:03:47] those things which were told them by the
[1:03:49] shepherds. But Mary kept all these
[1:03:51] things, and pondered them in her heart.
[1:03:55] And the shepherds returned glorifying
[1:03:57] and praising God for all the things that
[1:03:59] they had heard and seen. And it was told
[1:04:02] unto them.
[1:04:04] And when eight days were accomplished
[1:04:06] for the circumcising of the child, his
[1:04:08] name was called Jesus,
[1:04:10] which was so named of the angel before
[1:04:13] he was conceived in the womb.
[1:04:30] Silent
[1:04:32] night,
[1:04:34] holy

[1:07:40] our king.
[1:07:43] Christ the savior
[1:07:47] is born.
[1:07:52] Christ the Savior
[1:07:56] is born.
[1:08:54] When I hang my thread at the end of my
[1:08:59] rope.
[1:09:00] When I'm losing my grip and I've lost
[1:09:04] all hope.
[1:09:08] Along comes a strength beyond my
[1:09:12] control.
[1:09:14] Oh, that's what Jesus is.
[1:09:22] With the scoundrels and drunkards,
[1:09:24] lepers and me
[1:09:28] on a hill far away between a couple of
[1:09:31] thieves.
[1:09:35] the last place on earth you think he
[1:09:39] would be.
[1:09:42] But that's right where Jesus is.
[1:09:50] The prince of peace and perfect love.
[1:09:55] That's who he is and where I run. I
[1:10:00] can't count the ways that I'm not
[1:10:03] enough. But thank God. Oh, thank God.
[1:10:08] Jesus is
[1:10:14] when I'm walking back guilty from the
[1:10:17] places I go
[1:10:20] with no hesitation. He welcomes me home.
[1:10:26] He's not afraid to get mud on his robe.
[1:10:32] That's just how Jesus is.
[1:10:40] The prince of peace and perfect love.
[1:10:45] That's who he is and where I run. I
[1:10:50] can't count the ways that I'm not
[1:10:53] enough. But thank God. Oh, thank God.
[1:10:58] Jesus is
[1:11:03] the prince of peace and perfect love.
[1:11:08] That to he isn't where I run. I can't
[1:11:14] count the ways that I'm not enough. But
[1:11:18] thank God. Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.
[1:11:24] Oh, thank God.

[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right. Would that
[1:19:40] be okay if we played this a little bit?
[1:19:42] This is two minutes and I think it
[1:19:44] follows with uh with what was said, what
[1:19:46] was done, what was I listened to the
[1:19:49] songs and one of the songs
[1:19:52] is true light.
[1:19:55] This is brother Brandon. Talked to
[1:19:57] brother Steve beforehand. Brother, I'm
[1:19:59] going to just do it off of this mic if
[1:20:01] that's okay. It's only 2 minutes, 3
[1:20:03] minutes long, but listen to
[1:20:06] any place that I've ever seen in my
[1:20:08] life. Uh especially with this many
[1:20:11] people where there was so many nice
[1:20:14] Christians with this love. Don't never
[1:20:18] let that die among you. Just remember
[1:20:22] uh used to have little the saying
[1:20:24] amongst the people um my wife's name was
[1:20:28] hope my first wife Billy's mother used
[1:20:31] there's three of us then was hope and
[1:20:34] myself and Billy used to call us hope
[1:20:36] faith and charity and so I seem to have
[1:20:39] a burly faith like in those days to
[1:20:42] believe that this word was true and what
[1:20:44] God had promised he would do and but you
[1:20:47] see the greatest of this is charity is
[1:20:49] Love, like brother Leo expressed this
[1:20:51] morning, uh, love, where there is
[1:20:54] tongues that shall cease, where there's
[1:20:56] prophecies that'll fail. But when
[1:20:57] charity, which is love, it always will
[1:21:00] endure.
[1:21:02] Dear dying lamb, thy precious word shall
[1:21:04] never lose its power to all the ransom
[1:21:06] church of God be saved to sin no more.
[1:21:09] Ever since by faith, I saw the stream
[1:21:12] thy flowing wound supplied. Redeeming
[1:21:15] love has been my theme. It shall be till
[1:21:17] I die. I think there's nothing greater
[1:21:19] than love and love if we can't express
[1:21:23] it. Now, we can say that we have love.
[1:21:25] We're just saying that. But when we can
[1:21:28] really express what we said that we
[1:21:30] have, then we show it in ourselves. How
[1:21:33] we're not a perfect people. We make our
[1:21:36] mistakes. We do things that's wrong. But
[1:21:38] you see, love covers all of that. We're
[1:21:42] willing when we see our mistakes to come
[1:21:43] back and apologize to one another.
[1:21:46] That's that's warriors. That's that's
[1:21:49] really man of and women it's gallant.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Any man can go out to the battlefield.
[1:21:54] It's got nerve enough to walk out there,
[1:21:56] but when he gets knocked down, they get
[1:21:57] up and try it again. See,
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; used to be a song that a young man and
[1:22:01] young woman used to sing in the church.
[1:22:04] Um,
[1:22:05] if I fall or if I fail. See, if I fall
[1:22:09] or if I I forget how it goes. Let me
[1:22:11] rise and try again. Forgive me, Lord,
[1:22:14] and try me one more time. See, if I fall
[1:22:17] or if I sin, let me rise and try again.
[1:22:20] Just forgive me, Lord, and try me one
[1:22:23] more time.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; And with as many as 120 people here
[1:22:27] together, you're bound to just find
[1:22:30] things sometimes the enemy will sweep in
[1:22:33] among you and through your minds and and
[1:22:36] start this that. Just stop when he does
[1:22:38] it. Think back. Think of this morning.
[1:22:40] Think of the times when you're sitting
[1:22:42] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:22:44] Jesus.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we think of the wonderful
[1:22:48] times we're sitting together in heavenly
[1:22:51] places. Amen. Amen. You love the Lord.
[1:22:54] Amen. Amen. Um you know I brother Ryan
[1:23:01] may not seem like the best Christmas
[1:23:03] quote unquote quote victory ahead.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; But that is the best Christmas news I
[1:23:08] can tell you. there's victory ahead. You
[1:23:11] know, I was standing with the brother.
[1:23:12] It's uh you know, when he was minister,
[1:23:14] we were talking. We were just enjoying
[1:23:16] the company of each other. Um and he
[1:23:18] said, you know, I just feel like I'm so
[1:23:21] dry in my soul. I just need a little
[1:23:23] touch.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I raised my hand with that.
[1:23:28] Today is a good day. Tomorrow I don't
[1:23:31] know about.
[1:23:33] But there's victory ahead. So sing it
[1:23:35] with me with joy in your heart. Amen.
[1:23:38] Victory ahead. Oh, victory ahead.
[1:23:45] Victory ahead.
[1:23:48] The blood of Jesus.
[1:24:02] Yeah. Heat.
[1:24:13] Oh,
[1:24:32] heat, heat.
[1:24:38] Oh,
[1:24:58] heat, heat.
[1:25:09] Heat up
[1:25:22] here.
[1:25:29] A
[1:25:51] Yeah.
[1:25:53] Heat.
[1:26:05] Heat.
[1:26:09] Heat.
[1:26:19] Hey,
[1:26:56] Heat.
[1:27:00] Heat. Heat.
[1:27:10] replay of that. Listen, couple months
[1:27:13] ago, the church was getting a little
[1:27:16] quiet. It was a Wednesday night and it
[1:27:19] was kind of like, you know how Wednesday
[1:27:21] night can be sometimes. And I got
[1:27:23] inspired
[1:27:25] and I said, "Let's just go walk around
[1:27:27] the Do you remember that, Brother
[1:27:29] Everett?"
[1:27:31] I remember cuz he was the first one, you
[1:27:32] know. And I said, 'Lord, if Brother
[1:27:36] Donald turns it over to me right now,
[1:27:38] I'm going to have the church walk around
[1:27:40] again. And why don't you just go tell
[1:27:42] somebody this this kind of a marching
[1:27:44] beat, you know? It's got like a a
[1:27:46] marching beat. Why don't you get out of
[1:27:49] your seat? You go walk around a little
[1:27:50] bit and let the Lord know that you're
[1:27:52] you're here to conquer tread. Tell you
[1:27:54] what, why don't you do a little treading
[1:27:57] on the devil this morning and I'm
[1:27:59] Brother Donald, you stay up here, guard
[1:28:00] the pulpit if that'd be all right. Or
[1:28:02] you can walk if you want. I'll guard it.
[1:28:04] All right. I'm going to walk around and
[1:28:06] I'm going to tread on the devil a little
[1:28:08] bit. We're going to tread him down. Then
[1:28:09] we're going to invite the the brother to
[1:28:11] come out in a minute and we're going to
[1:28:12] victory ahead. Oh, victory ahead.
[1:28:17] Yes. The victory.
[1:28:31] Oh,
[1:28:50] heat, heat.
[1:28:55] Heat.
[1:28:59] Heat.
[1:29:13] Heat.
[1:29:22] Heat.
[1:29:30] Heat.
[1:29:32] Heat.
[1:29:42] Oh
[1:29:49] my god.
[1:29:51] Heat.
[1:30:03] Amen.
[1:30:30] Amen.
[1:30:32] You didn't think I was crazy. You think
[1:30:33] I was crazy now? That's all right. I
[1:30:36] think the prophet of God said something
[1:30:37] like this. This will be the quietest
[1:30:39] place you'll ever worship the Lord.
[1:30:42] So, I just kind of believed that. Thank
[1:30:44] the Lord. Brother Jeremiah, thank you
[1:30:46] for filling up the little blank spot up
[1:30:48] here. I was wanting to go sit there
[1:30:49] myself, but you all filled it up. Now,
[1:30:51] you loosened up a little bit. When the
[1:30:53] brother comes out, it's not the brother.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; When that word goes forth, Amen. that
[1:30:57] word, pull on it, ask for something from
[1:31:00] the Lord. And we do believe that you'll
[1:31:02] receive what you ask for. Uh for
[1:31:04] everybody, we have enough food at the
[1:31:06] end of the service. We had catering
[1:31:08] being brought in. So, you're welcome.
[1:31:09] Please stay and fellowship with us after
[1:31:11] the service. There's some desserts down
[1:31:14] there. And if you got a sweet tooth and
[1:31:16] we'd love to have all of you stay. It's
[1:31:18] been a blessing. And um already been a
[1:31:21] blessing this morning. My heart was
[1:31:22] refreshed just watching the children and
[1:31:25] hearing the songs and just truly was
[1:31:28] blessed in the Lord. So, amen. Ask the
[1:31:32] Lord to bless us now as the brother
[1:31:33] would come and we'll sing Amazing Grace,
[1:31:35] Brother Ryan, and Brother Eli's been
[1:31:37] here several times. Always appreciated
[1:31:39] his ministry, fellowships with brother
[1:31:41] Aaron McGary and a wonderful fellowship
[1:31:44] down there. So we just ask the Lord
[1:31:47] would speak to us this morning.
[1:32:07] Yeah.
[1:32:11] Heat.
[1:32:29] Heat
[1:32:38] up
[1:32:46] here.
[1:32:56] Yeah.
[1:32:58] Heat.
[1:33:12] Heat. Heat.
[1:33:26] A
[1:34:03] Amen.
[1:34:05] To a Christian, that song never gets
[1:34:06] old.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace.
[1:34:10] I love how it says whenever I I realized
[1:34:14] the grace of God when the first time I
[1:34:16] believed that's when the relief came you
[1:34:20] know the grace is always here when
[1:34:23] that's why Jesus came that's why he he
[1:34:25] was in a major that's why he became a
[1:34:27] man that's why he died and that grace
[1:34:30] has been spread abroad this whole earth
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; for years and years and years
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; but it's whenever you believe
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; that grace is here.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; It's ready.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; When you believe, you are relieved.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; When you believe, you are set free.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; When you believe, that major becomes
[1:34:50] real.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; When you believe, the Holy Ghost is here
[1:34:54] for you.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; So, Amazing Grace is going to be your
[1:34:59] song the your whole life.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Um, I'm just so thankful for our brother
[1:35:03] Steve. Um, it's always a blessing to be
[1:35:05] here. um always a great atmosphere with
[1:35:08] each and every one of you and just the
[1:35:09] worship and seeing the little kids um
[1:35:13] worshiping the Lord, you know, it's it's
[1:35:15] just such a beautiful thing to see an
[1:35:16] innocent heart and um that's why I love
[1:35:20] that Jesus says, "Forbid the children um
[1:35:23] to come to me." He says, "Come, they are
[1:35:26] the kingdom of heaven."
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; So, let us go straight to the scriptures
[1:35:30] if you like.
[1:35:32] I don't want to take too much of your
[1:35:34] time, but um so I'll try to um not be
[1:35:39] too lengthy.
[1:35:43] Like brother uh Steve said, we we're
[1:35:45] coming from brother Aaron Mciris. Um I
[1:35:48] just want to greet you all for him and
[1:35:50] um greet you all in the precious name of
[1:35:52] Jesus Christ. If you'd like to turn with
[1:35:55] me to 2 Corinthians
[1:35:58] 4
[1:36:00] 6 and 7. Now, my title is a little
[1:36:04] Christmy, but I I hope my delivery is
[1:36:08] also it's not um you know, I can't bring
[1:36:11] you the the tinsel and the wrapping
[1:36:13] paper and and all these things, but
[1:36:16] we're going to go into God's word and
[1:36:18] see what what the the word says to us
[1:36:22] today.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; So, my title today is earthly wrapping
[1:36:26] and heavenly gift. And I I get that
[1:36:28] inspiration from brother Brandham's
[1:36:30] message, God's wrapped gift. I I
[1:36:32] encourage each and every one of you to
[1:36:33] to really listen to it and um see the
[1:36:36] depth
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; of that message in its simplicity
[1:36:40] because he preaches it so simple, but
[1:36:42] it's so deep. And that's kind of my
[1:36:44] inspiration for this message here. So
[1:36:48] the Bible says here in 2 Corinthians 4:6
[1:36:50] and 7 says, "For God who commanded light
[1:36:54] to shine out of darkness has shined in
[1:36:57] our hearts to give the light of
[1:37:00] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[1:37:02] face of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:05] But we have this treasure in earthn
[1:37:08] vessels." the that the excellently
[1:37:11] excellency of the power may be of God
[1:37:14] and not of us.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Let us bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[1:37:19] we have read your scripture,
[1:37:21] Lord. Well, we already feel your
[1:37:23] presence. We know you're here working in
[1:37:24] the people, Father. You know every need.
[1:37:26] You know everything we need, Father. And
[1:37:28] we're just putting it in your hands. We
[1:37:30] ask that you just continue to have the
[1:37:32] preeminence, Lord, and speak to us. Give
[1:37:34] to us exactly what we need, Father. We
[1:37:36] give you the honor, the glory in the
[1:37:38] name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. You
[1:37:41] may be seated. So I I really appreciate
[1:37:45] Paul very um knowledgeable man full of
[1:37:48] re revelation. He says that we have this
[1:37:52] treasure. Now he explained what the
[1:37:53] treasure was. He said this light hath
[1:37:55] come is this is the knowledge of the
[1:37:57] glory of God that is seen in the face of
[1:38:00] Jesus Christ. It is the word. It is
[1:38:03] Jesus Christ. And he says, "It has been
[1:38:06] shown into each and every person's heart
[1:38:08] that is willing." Right? So now he's
[1:38:11] like, "Well, think about it." That's the
[1:38:13] way I feel like Paul is kind of talking
[1:38:15] to us. He's like, "Think about it.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; We have this treasure
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; hidden in earthn vessels.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; And the earthn vessel is you and I.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; We are that earthly wrapping paper,
[1:38:29] right?
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; But we have a gift. We have a treasure
[1:38:33] that is there. And I like what he says.
[1:38:35] He says that the excellency of the power
[1:38:39] may be of God
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; and not of us.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; So sometimes, you know, my wife and I've
[1:38:47] seen other people, they they wrap
[1:38:50] presents really really nice.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; And and you know what? Sometimes we just
[1:38:54] don't appreciate the wrapping sometimes
[1:38:57] cuz we come and I'm I'm just like an
[1:39:00] animal and I just don't appreciate all
[1:39:03] the time and effort that she did just to
[1:39:05] wrap the present because I'm actually
[1:39:07] interested in the gift.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; I'm actually interested in what's
[1:39:12] inside.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; And Paul, he's saying that the glory
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; may not be of us.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; What are we just the wrapping?
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; We're just the wrapping. But we're
[1:39:23] hiding something.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; You're you're hiding something in this
[1:39:27] earthly vessel.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; That's true,
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; brother. He says, now that's I just
[1:39:33] wanted to say that. We're going to go a
[1:39:35] whole lot deeper and I hope it's just
[1:39:36] not too too much, but um Brother
[1:39:39] Brandham says um in God's wrapped gift
[1:39:42] preached in 1960. He says, "It ought to
[1:39:44] be real attractive to the people. Little
[1:39:47] Jehovah crying like a baby. God made
[1:39:50] flesh in a package. God who covers now
[1:39:54] he explains God right
[1:39:58] there. There's, you know, we we try to
[1:39:59] fit things in in certain boxes like we
[1:40:01] have extra Amazon packages. We're like,
[1:40:03] we're going to fit that gift in that
[1:40:05] package, right? This is what God tried
[1:40:07] to do and he did it successfully. He
[1:40:10] said, "God who covers all space and time
[1:40:13] was before the world or or a star or a
[1:40:17] molecule wrapped himself in a little
[1:40:19] package and was laid in a manger
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; in a stable where the manurss of the
[1:40:25] cattle and the sheep and things up all
[1:40:28] um over at that stable. And in this
[1:40:31] little manger or straw or hay, Jehovah
[1:40:34] was laying there crying like a baby.
[1:40:37] Then he says, "Can you imagine it?"
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; He gives us the authority to like just
[1:40:41] think about it and just say, "You know
[1:40:43] what? Just let it run in your mind
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; that this eternal being that we serve,
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; this God that knows every thought,
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; just like the sister's testimony that he
[1:40:54] he's working things."
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; See, you go you go out
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; to Flagstaff, you go into Phoenix and
[1:41:00] you just see the hustle and bustle.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; You see cars crashing. You see people
[1:41:05] walking by here, going there, going to
[1:41:08] Target, coming out of here, doing this,
[1:41:10] having errands to do, going to work, and
[1:41:12] you have see all this hustle and bustle,
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; and you have to step out and think. I I
[1:41:18] started to think about it during your
[1:41:20] testimony, sister, just to think that
[1:41:22] it's like God doesn't only know the
[1:41:24] movement and the thoughts of the people,
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; but he's orchestrated every step. Yeah.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; So even though you see chaos and all
[1:41:32] these things, you don't know that that
[1:41:35] car crash, you'll be like, "Oh man, that
[1:41:37] guy was crazy." And you just keep going.
[1:41:39] That car crash was for a reason. So that
[1:41:42] person may maybe he's going to the
[1:41:43] hospital. The other person's maybe going
[1:41:45] to jail or something else. And then
[1:41:47] things are happening in their life that
[1:41:49] is ultimately going to be for God's
[1:41:52] purpose in every single thing. Amen.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; If you see a bird going that way, there
[1:41:57] is a specific reason.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Thank God for that."
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; God knows all things. And and um he did
[1:42:05] the same thing. Now, so I started to
[1:42:08] think about it, how God
[1:42:11] wrapped in this little gift.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; And um I wanted to go all the way to the
[1:42:15] beginning and and begin to start
[1:42:17] thinking about this profound statement
[1:42:19] of God's wrapped gift
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; that that God could have. He said this
[1:42:23] was the greatest Christmas gift that God
[1:42:25] the first and the greatest
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; he could give to people. It was what? It
[1:42:30] was his eternal being wrapped in flesh.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. Why is that so important?
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Why why is that so important? So I
[1:42:39] started to think about um Stephen when
[1:42:42] he was there uh in the Sanhedrin
[1:42:45] council,
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; And these people they they would hear
[1:42:48] his wisdom. They said, the Bible says
[1:42:50] that he had so much wisdom of God and he
[1:42:53] would just wrap those people up and they
[1:42:55] they just couldn't do anything. So what
[1:42:57] they needed to do is they needed to
[1:43:00] bring up two false witnesses.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; They said, "You know what? We need to
[1:43:03] accuse this man and put him to death
[1:43:06] because he's causing trouble." What
[1:43:07] there was the two um accusations that
[1:43:09] they did to this man. They said, "You
[1:43:12] know what? He's speaking against our the
[1:43:14] law of Moses,
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; right? and he he's speaking against the
[1:43:18] holy temple of God.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Those are the two things they accused
[1:43:22] him of. Amen.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; So now you have you have Stephen and he
[1:43:26] he comes to his defense
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; and and he begins to answer to these
[1:43:31] charges that they they've laid out
[1:43:33] before him and you he's there in the
[1:43:35] council and everybody's just ready ready
[1:43:37] to just tear him to pieces
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; and he gives this a long speech
[1:43:41] reviewing Israel's history from Abraham
[1:43:45] to Joseph to Moses then to David all the
[1:43:48] way to Solomon
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; and his main point here here in Acts
[1:43:52] Acts 7:48 and 49.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; His main point is that God has never
[1:43:57] been limited to any building,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; any place. He's never been limited to
[1:44:03] any of those things
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; because they were saying, "Well, this is
[1:44:05] our holy temple and you're speaking
[1:44:07] against it." And he said, "You think
[1:44:08] he's limited to this place?"
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; That was his his statement. And and when
[1:44:15] he reaches Acts 40 uh 7:48 and 49, he
[1:44:19] explains how that although Solomon built
[1:44:22] the temple, God does not live in
[1:44:24] man-made structures.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; And and and to support this, he quoted
[1:44:28] Isaiah 66:1
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; where where it says, "How be it here in
[1:44:33] Acts 48 and 49, how be it the most high
[1:44:35] dwelleth not in temples made with hands,
[1:44:38] as saith the prophet, heaven is my
[1:44:40] throne, and earth is my foottool. What
[1:44:43] house will you ye build me? Sayaeth the
[1:44:45] Lord. Or what is the place of my rest?
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Now, he's asking a question.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "Where is it?" He He's He went
[1:44:54] all the way down the history of Israel
[1:44:56] and showed him that he wasn't limited in
[1:44:58] a place. Yet, they wanted to create an
[1:45:01] epicenter. He wanted to create a a a
[1:45:04] place. They wanted to create a place to
[1:45:05] where you say, "Oh, well, we are the
[1:45:07] children of God. This is the place of
[1:45:09] God." And he says that God's not
[1:45:11] limited. You're putting him in a box
[1:45:12] there.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; What was the purpose of his statement?
[1:45:17] That heavens and earth
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; all of creation that he created could
[1:45:22] not contain him.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Cannot contain him.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; And so God's asking him, "Where is my
[1:45:28] place?"
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Where do I abide?
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; So the purpose of the statement for him
[1:45:34] was was to show Israel that he they
[1:45:36] repeatedly misunderstood God's presence.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Correct. and and and to correct the idea
[1:45:42] that the temple was itself a guarantee
[1:45:44] of God's favor. We see that over there
[1:45:47] in um during uh Samuel's time during or
[1:45:50] yeah during Samuel's time where where
[1:45:52] Eli the high priest and his sons they've
[1:45:55] sinned and and and the
[1:45:58] the ark was taken away and they trusted
[1:46:01] in the ark so much so and they forgot
[1:46:04] the obedience of God and they said you
[1:46:06] know what if we have the ark we're going
[1:46:07] to be successful but they didn't know
[1:46:09] that God wasn't interested in that he
[1:46:12] was interested in the obedience of the
[1:46:14] children of
[1:46:16] s.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; so they they were they were um thinking
[1:46:20] that was God's guaranteed favor and it
[1:46:23] wasn't. Now, the last reason for the
[1:46:25] statement was was a setup for his rebuke
[1:46:28] overall that accuses the accounts for
[1:46:31] being stubborn and resisting the Holy
[1:46:33] Ghost which ultimately led him to his
[1:46:36] martyrdom. Right?
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; So, so his his whole point he went and
[1:46:41] he said, "And that's why you resist the
[1:46:44] Holy Spirit."
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't accept Jesus Christ
[1:46:49] because the Holy Spirit is not over
[1:46:51] there in that temple that was rented
[1:46:53] when Jesus Christ died.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; So, he goes and he says all that and the
[1:46:58] reason why I'm saying this is because he
[1:47:00] quotes Isaiah 66:1 and he says, "Where
[1:47:03] is my place?
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Where do I sleep? Where do I stay?
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Um, Hebrews 10:5, if you'd like to turn
[1:47:10] with me, it says, "Wherefore he cometh
[1:47:14] into the world, he saith, sacrifice and
[1:47:16] offering thou wouldest not, but a body
[1:47:20] thou prepared me."
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Thou a body hast thou prepared me?
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now the reason why I'm
[1:47:28] saying this is because brother Brandham
[1:47:30] you know being um a prophet
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; what he does to these two scriptures
[1:47:35] here in Acts for uh 7:48 and 49 and and
[1:47:39] Hebrews 10:5 he goes and he brings those
[1:47:42] two scriptures together.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; He does a little bit of copy and paste
[1:47:46] here.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; And and and because Hebrews 10:5 is an
[1:47:50] answer to Acts 7:48 and 49.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, he says this in
[1:47:57] the message, "What house will you build
[1:47:59] me?" Preached in 1965. He says he he
[1:48:02] combines the two scriptures and he says,
[1:48:03] "But how be it the most high dwellst not
[1:48:06] in temples made with hands. See, for
[1:48:08] heaven is my throne and earth is my
[1:48:10] foottool and where is the place of my
[1:48:13] rest?" Then brother Ben Brandham says,
[1:48:15] "But a body thou hast prepared me."
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so he's not limited in all
[1:48:21] these things, but God prepared himself a
[1:48:24] body.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; He prepared himself, if I would like to
[1:48:29] say, people.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just one body.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; God came down to to change everything in
[1:48:36] a body, but he prepared human beings
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; to be his temple.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 1:26, we see that clearly,
[1:48:45] right? where it says, "God said, let us
[1:48:49] make man in our own image
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; after our likeness, and let them have
[1:48:53] dominion over the fish of the sea, over
[1:48:55] the fowl, over the air, over the the
[1:48:58] cattle, over the all of the earth, and
[1:49:00] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:49:03] upon the earth." Now, in this scripture,
[1:49:06] God creates man out of his eternal
[1:49:09] spirit. He was a piece of God.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; everything else he says, "Let us create
[1:49:15] fish out of the water. Let's create the
[1:49:17] animal out of the field. Let's create
[1:49:19] this out of here. Let us make man out of
[1:49:22] my image.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; So he created a man. It was an eternal
[1:49:27] spirit.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; It was a spirit of God.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; And and when he created this spirit, he
[1:49:35] gave this spirit dominion.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let them have dominion over
[1:49:40] the earth." So, it's if you would like,
[1:49:43] if I if I could say this, it's the
[1:49:45] spirit that rules.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; The spirit is the one that rules the
[1:49:50] earth.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's who he gave the dominion
[1:49:54] over.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; And and he gave this them this decree as
[1:49:59] spirits being part of God. But the world
[1:50:02] was a place of dirt.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Correct?
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; So he gives this spirit, but this place
[1:50:08] is
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; tangible. Right?
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; You got to touch the ground.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; You got to have hands and feet.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; You got to shake the brother's hand.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; You got to give your testimony.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; You got to live the life.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; So, so he gave this to spirits, but the
[1:50:27] earth is dirt.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; So, we see this dilemma and we see that
[1:50:31] dilemma in in Acts 7:48 and 49.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; He says, you know what? Um, I'm this
[1:50:37] great God, but I need a place.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I need something to work in.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says in the message
[1:50:46] um question and answers on Genesis
[1:50:48] preached in 1953. This is a lengthy
[1:50:50] lengthy quote, but I I'll try to get as
[1:50:52] quick as possible. He says, "Now, if a
[1:50:54] man was made
[1:50:56] made
[1:50:58] um made something like that, like that
[1:51:00] little sacred light yonder or something
[1:51:02] like that that it could not be seen,
[1:51:04] which is a spiritual being."
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Right? See, now we are made in the same
[1:51:08] material of God's unseen spirit. He just
[1:51:11] said that we are made of that that
[1:51:13] spiritual being.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; He manifested or unfolded himself a
[1:51:17] little more to make the trinity of
[1:51:19] himself, father, son, holy spirit. There
[1:51:21] he was. God unfolded himself now down
[1:51:24] into let us make man, which was his son
[1:51:28] a as an offspring from him, man in his
[1:51:30] own image. He was a supernatural being.
[1:51:33] Yes.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; And he let them have dominion over the
[1:51:36] cows, over the field and so forth and
[1:51:39] let man let um led the cattle and
[1:51:42] everything just like the Holy Spirit
[1:51:45] leads a real believer today.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Um the voice of God out there, the voice
[1:51:50] of man rather should speak and say,
[1:51:52] "Call the cattle this way. Call the
[1:51:54] sheep over in this pasture. Call the
[1:51:56] fishes to the water." See, he had
[1:51:58] dominion dominion. Everything obeyed
[1:52:01] him. But now
[1:52:03] or or now but then there was no man to
[1:52:06] till the soil.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; So what was it? Earth needed a physical
[1:52:11] connection.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Genesis 2, no man to till the soil. Then
[1:52:15] God formed man out of the dust of the
[1:52:19] earth. So now everything, it's amazing.
[1:52:22] God, when he created everything, he
[1:52:23] stood back and he said, "Let there be."
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Let the fish come out of here. Let all
[1:52:29] these things. and he stood back and he
[1:52:30] allowed the earth to to form what he was
[1:52:35] calling out
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; of the earth, out of the dust. But when
[1:52:38] he said, "Let us create man out of our
[1:52:41] own image," he went down and he touched
[1:52:44] man.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; He formed himself.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; He put his own hands on it. So who we
[1:52:51] are, no matter how we look, no matter
[1:52:53] what color we are, no matter what
[1:52:55] ethnicity, whatever race, whatever we
[1:52:58] are, we are specially made from God.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; We we he he he went down and he he's
[1:53:06] like, you know what? I got this.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; I want to specifically make this. Why do
[1:53:11] you want to make that?
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he do that to the horse? Why
[1:53:14] didn't he do that? Because this was a
[1:53:17] temple he was building.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. This this was something that was
[1:53:22] going to wrap his holy spirit in.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; He needed this perfect.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; So he followed he formed man out of the
[1:53:30] dust of the earth and put his
[1:53:32] supernatural spirit.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Now he was laying there and I can have
[1:53:36] many pictures of it. He says I can see
[1:53:38] Adam standing let's say take this way
[1:53:41] him standing there like a tree and and
[1:53:43] God made him and he was dead as dead
[1:53:45] could be his toes like the roots
[1:53:47] sticking to in the ground. And God said,
[1:53:49] "Let there breathe be or breathe the
[1:53:51] breath of life in him." And he jumped
[1:53:53] and came to himself and he breathed the
[1:53:56] breath of life to him. He became a
[1:53:58] living soul. Now he became to move on
[1:54:01] and move on. He says, now he continues
[1:54:04] on just so that I can kind of solidify
[1:54:06] this point in blasphemous names and
[1:54:09] preach in 1962. He says, "But God, what
[1:54:12] did God um but what what God did breathe
[1:54:16] the breath of eternal life." Amen.
[1:54:20] Then he becomes a living soul. A soul
[1:54:23] can't die. Now watch. We're going to get
[1:54:26] in into the honey plum into your elbows.
[1:54:29] Notice breathe the breath of eternal
[1:54:31] life into his nostrils. And he became an
[1:54:34] eternal soul. cause cuz God breathed not
[1:54:38] what nature done
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; but what God did
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; breathe the breath of life into his
[1:54:44] nostrils and then he became a living
[1:54:46] soul. So so there there had to been this
[1:54:49] body and then the only way to become
[1:54:52] this living soul was the breath of
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; not just the air
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; eternal life
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; then he became a living soul.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:03] here. Here he says this, and this is
[1:55:05] rather crude, but the prophet says it,
[1:55:07] so just don't don't um throw rocks at
[1:55:10] me, please. But it says um 1953 um
[1:55:14] question and answers on Genesis. This is
[1:55:16] a good picture because why are we
[1:55:18] talking about all this? Well, well,
[1:55:20] let's see it in another way.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; If if a man doesn't have a spirit,
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; why are we made? He says, "Now you take
[1:55:28] the Holy Spirit off a man
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; says he's lower than an animal.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; He's worse than an animal.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; That's a hard thing to say.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; But you can take a man that's
[1:55:39] ungenerated in his mind without the Holy
[1:55:41] Spirit to direct his thoughts and and
[1:55:44] things thing like that and he would
[1:55:46] throw a baby out of his mother's arms
[1:55:47] and ravish her for beastly lust." That's
[1:55:51] exas Exactly.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; What is it? a man out of his position.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; A man not being used for what he was
[1:56:01] created for.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; So any person, any man, any woman that
[1:56:06] is living this life without the Holy
[1:56:08] Spirit is out of dislocated,
[1:56:12] out of of position with God.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; As he says, we are become lower than
[1:56:18] animals.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Right? Because just just to uh back up
[1:56:23] brother Brandham on this because we have
[1:56:26] the choice.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; We have such a an authority.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; That we can do whatever we want to do.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Animals don't have that.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; They just go by nature, by instinct, by
[1:56:39] all these things, by they know what to
[1:56:41] do already.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; We we have a free moral agency. Correct.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; And without the spirit of God,
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; we begin to use that free moral agency
[1:56:52] in horrible ways. And we can see it
[1:56:54] today.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; We are living in that today.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; So, so Genesis 2, he creates a body for
[1:57:01] that spirit to operate and to rule. So,
[1:57:04] now we're understanding why he needed a
[1:57:07] place. He needed he needed something.
[1:57:10] This means man, he cannot dominate the
[1:57:13] earth without God's spirit.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's a decree of dominion
[1:57:18] that he gave to the spirit and not the
[1:57:20] flesh.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; That's why we can conquer, we can be the
[1:57:23] greatest, but
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; all we're doing is just ruining this
[1:57:26] place
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; because he gave the decree, the dominion
[1:57:30] to the spirit
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; of man, which is part of God.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; So, and also also God will not fully
[1:57:39] operate or reveal himself without man.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; So, it takes two, right?
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. So God God he when he his greatest
[1:57:47] revelation when he is when he comes into
[1:57:51] man
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; his greatest revelation was when he was
[1:57:55] all man and all God in the same body.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; because that's how God made it.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; So man, we are the spirit's vehicle to
[1:58:05] operate.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Bammy says in the message a a
[1:58:09] greater than Solomon is here. He says,
[1:58:12] "Now he has no hands but yours and
[1:58:15] mine."
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; He has no voice but mine and yours.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; See, the vine doesn't bear fruit. The
[1:58:21] branch bears fruit.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; And if the branch
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; um bore the first limb that came out of
[1:58:26] the the grape vine, as I said, they
[1:58:28] wrote a book of Acts behind it. If they
[1:58:31] ever put forth a another original vine,
[1:58:34] you will write another book of Acts
[1:58:36] behind it. It'll be the same spirit cuz
[1:58:39] the same life in the entire vine every
[1:58:42] branch bears will be there.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; So we are the hands, we are the feet.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; You are important.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do,
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; What whatever you God has a purpose for
[1:58:55] you and he wants to operate through you.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; So Christianity is just not coming to
[1:59:00] church.
[1:59:01] Christianity is not just just doing
[1:59:04] traditional ritual things, but it's a
[1:59:07] life lived.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; God living your life through you,
[1:59:12] operating through you.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Now, now you have to think that we
[1:59:20] the spirit that's if you look at how
[1:59:23] we're made as a as a seed and all those
[1:59:25] things that we are we have a compartment
[1:59:28] for that holy spirit. We are are
[1:59:30] completely created for that Holy Ghost
[1:59:33] to come in.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 3:16,
[1:59:39] it says, "Know ye not that ye are the
[1:59:41] temple of God
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; and that the that the spirit of God
[1:59:44] dwelleth in you?"
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; So he's ask he's letting them know.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; He says, "Do do you know why you are the
[1:59:50] temple?"
[1:59:53] 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 it says, "What?
[1:59:57] Know ye not uh um know ye not know ye
[2:00:01] not that your body is a temple of the
[2:00:03] Holy Ghost which is in in you which ye
[2:00:05] have of God and ye are not of your own.
[2:00:08] So there he he's explaining that our
[2:00:11] body is not our own.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; That we we can uh do so much in this
[2:00:16] flesh and we can do all this but but
[2:00:18] remember that we should not live with
[2:00:21] these five senses.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We should not operate um pleasing
[2:00:26] this five senses
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; but we should make sure that the spirit
[2:00:30] in us leads everywhere we go.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Now now um ne next scripture is 2
[2:00:40] Corinthians 4 6 and 7. It says for and
[2:00:45] this is the my our opening scripture. It
[2:00:47] says, "For God who commanded the light
[2:00:49] to shine out of darkness has shined in
[2:00:52] our hearts to give light of the
[2:00:54] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[2:00:56] face of Jesus Christ. But we have this
[2:00:59] treasure in earthn vessels that the
[2:01:01] excellency of the power may be of God
[2:01:03] and not of us."
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; So that's what we are made of. Now, now
[2:01:08] we have this great fight going, right?
[2:01:10] Brother Brandon said it was the greatest
[2:01:12] battle ever fought. Amen.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; And the fight is not for earthly
[2:01:16] dominion.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; It's not for your finances.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; It's not for the house that you're
[2:01:21] paying off.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; It's not It's not for your health even.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; What is this fight for? It's for you.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; It's for you.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; It's It's to have dominion of you
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; because we are not of ourselves. We are
[2:01:40] temples.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:42] We are meant to be dwelt in.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; We are meant to to operate as the spirit
[2:01:48] operates.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; So, so why my question is why is the
[2:01:53] devil so eager to attack the children of
[2:01:56] God?
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Why is he so eager to to possess the
[2:02:01] people of this world?
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Why why does he want this kingdom?
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; What what what's who is this person?
[2:02:10] Well, in Genesis 1:1, the Bible says God
[2:02:13] created heavens and earth. And in
[2:02:15] between that, brother Brandham says was
[2:02:17] trillions and trillions and hundreds and
[2:02:19] trillions of years.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; And in that space, in that period, God
[2:02:24] created heavenly kingdoms, heavenly
[2:02:28] beings. He created all those things
[2:02:31] within that time. Brother Brandham says
[2:02:35] within that py uh period this dramatic
[2:02:38] scene of a person named Lucifer was
[2:02:41] created
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; his co-artnership was there
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; and his rebellion took place there
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; something happened right there
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; right
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; now now Isaiah uh in Isaiah 14:12
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; right
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; God calls this Satan Lucifer
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Lucifer what does it mean a lightbearer
[2:03:03] or the shining one.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think about that in
[2:03:06] your mind.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about a body.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; I I want you to think about someone who
[2:03:13] who had the light of God in him,
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; He was a shining angel. And Ezekiel, it
[2:03:19] says whenever Ezekiel began to see that
[2:03:21] vision coming from the north, he saw a
[2:03:23] great big storm coming from the north.
[2:03:26] He saw it twirling and then he saw a a a
[2:03:29] fire. It says it was engulfing itself.
[2:03:32] Then when it became to get closer and
[2:03:34] closer, he saw beings stepping out of
[2:03:37] it.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Remember remember that? Amazing.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Amazing. It terrify anybody. He said
[2:03:44] that it was it was these living
[2:03:45] creatures, these cherubim
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; walking out of the and and they were
[2:03:50] like amber. Brother Brandham says every
[2:03:52] time you hear and you hear amber in the
[2:03:55] Bible, you know exactly what that is.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; It was God's own light.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:00] What was he was this this angel was
[2:04:03] engulfed in God's light. It was his
[2:04:06] clothing. It was his makeup.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Think about it
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; here in in uh
[2:04:12] in Ezekiel Ezekiel 28:14 and 6. It says
[2:04:16] that he was called the covering cherub.
[2:04:18] It also says that that all the rainbow
[2:04:21] colors was his covering. The onyx, the
[2:04:26] all all those beautiful colors. It says
[2:04:28] that that was his covering,
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; And it says that he was lifted up. Why?
[2:04:35] Because of his brightness and his
[2:04:37] beauty,
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; So th that's what this angel is. He was
[2:04:41] brother Baram says everything he he
[2:04:45] wanted to make everything beautiful.
[2:04:46] Why? He was a beautiful angel.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; You think he was he was beautiful in his
[2:04:51] heart?
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; He was a beautiful angel.
[2:04:55] his whatever however God created him, he
[2:04:58] was the most beautiful angel there.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; That's how God created him.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Now here um
[2:05:09] here in 1 Corinthians 15:38
[2:05:12] here Paul begins to explain different
[2:05:16] kinds of bodies.
[2:05:18] He says, "But God giveth a body which um
[2:05:21] which it hath pleased him, and to every
[2:05:24] seed is his own body.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; All flesh is not the same flesh, but
[2:05:30] there is one one kind of flesh of men,
[2:05:32] the other of beasts, the other of
[2:05:34] fishes, the other of birds. There are
[2:05:35] also celestial bodies and terrestrial
[2:05:39] bodies, but the glory of the ter
[2:05:41] celestial is one and the glory of the
[2:05:43] terrestrial is the other."
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Correct?
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So remember what is a body?
[2:05:49] It's a temple.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; It's a wrapping paper.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; It's a dwelling place.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; And and this this angel,
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; he he was a temple also.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Now in Luke 17 there there's this um
[2:06:06] strange picture here. Now, in in
[2:06:10] the New Testament, the Old Testament
[2:06:12] doesn't really talk about devils and
[2:06:15] demons and and and spirits and all that,
[2:06:17] but but the New Testament really with a
[2:06:20] razor knife, it just begins to
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; expose and show all those things. In
[2:06:28] Luke 7 uh 10:17 and 18 it says that the
[2:06:31] 70 returned again with joy saying even
[2:06:35] the devils are subject unto us through
[2:06:38] thy name.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Now think about it. Why were they
[2:06:41] rejoicing?
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Because through the name of Jesus Christ
[2:06:46] they were able to cast out a spirit from
[2:06:49] a person.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; What are these spirits?
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Right? You you go to the theologians,
[2:06:55] you go to other people, they say, "Oh,
[2:06:57] well, those spirits are are different
[2:06:59] from the angels." And but brother Benham
[2:07:01] says those were the angels.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; These spirits,
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; why they what what were they doing? They
[2:07:09] were trying to press themselves in human
[2:07:11] flesh.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; And God Jesus Christ gave them the
[2:07:15] authority through his name to cast out
[2:07:17] those devils. And and there they were
[2:07:20] rejoicing. And in 18, Jesus says unto
[2:07:24] them, "And I beheld." Now, he goes back
[2:07:26] and I don't know if he got a vision or
[2:07:28] what, but he says, "I beheld Satan as
[2:07:31] lightning fall from heaven."
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; what was it? He had a picture of what
[2:07:36] happened over there in heaven.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; Right,
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; man? That poor devil's always getting
[2:07:42] cast out.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; He's getting So, when they they were
[2:07:46] over there, we cast them out, Lord. We
[2:07:48] cast them out. He's like, "Ah, just like
[2:07:50] the beginning."
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Cast him out over there. He saw I saw
[2:07:54] him as lightning fall from heaven onto
[2:07:57] this earth.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amazing.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; So, so this act of casting out a spirit
[2:08:05] out of a body, he sees Satan fall out of
[2:08:09] his habitation.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to Jude um 16
[2:08:17] here. this scripture. A a lot of people,
[2:08:20] a lot of theologians, a lot of great
[2:08:22] well-known people will tie this
[2:08:25] scripture with Noah's time
[2:08:29] showing they'll say, "Oh, that the sons
[2:08:31] of God saw that the daughters of men,
[2:08:33] they said that angels press themselves
[2:08:35] in human bodies."
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; And they'll use this scripture.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? Just to give them
[2:08:42] their credit, I know they're reading
[2:08:43] from the book of Enoch and other things,
[2:08:46] but to give them their credit,
[2:08:48] they're correct, but they're dislocated.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Because that angel pressed into a human
[2:08:55] body, but it wasn't there. It was in the
[2:08:57] Garden of Eden.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't a human body. It was a
[2:09:01] serpent.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; He pressed himself and he went and he
[2:09:05] went with the children of
[2:09:08] men. went with the women
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; which her name was Eve,
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; But they they thought it was there. So,
[2:09:15] um just to give you that that's not in
[2:09:17] my notes, but
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; there um it says that the angels which
[2:09:22] now I want you to just capture every
[2:09:25] single word here because Jude, he's a
[2:09:28] tremendous man. He says, "And the angels
[2:09:30] which kept not their first estate, but
[2:09:33] left," so they kept not their first
[2:09:35] estate, "
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Left their own habitation,
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; he hath reserved in everlasting chains
[2:09:42] under darkness unto the judgment of the
[2:09:45] great day."
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; So what happened? They they could not
[2:09:49] keep their first position.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Lucifer was the greatest. All of the
[2:09:55] angels that were behind him, they they
[2:09:56] were great. And God kicked them out of
[2:09:59] their position.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; And and and the Bible says, "And now he
[2:10:04] hath reserved." People say, "Oh, yeah,
[2:10:06] they're somewhere in chains and all of
[2:10:08] that." But but it it means he has kept
[2:10:11] them
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; means that God has fixed their fate
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; into his plan. And even though Satan and
[2:10:18] his de uh demons, they're still active
[2:10:20] now.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; There's a sign and there's a judgment
[2:10:23] coming. You have been reserved for
[2:10:26] judgment. That's true.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Just like whenever God gives us the Holy
[2:10:29] Spirit, we are reserved or we have the
[2:10:32] earnest of what? Our resurrection.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; So whenever God, he reserved, he kicked
[2:10:38] them out. He reserved eternal judgment
[2:10:40] to them.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; They're still roaming around, but
[2:10:43] they're in darkness.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; They're in in they're in a a in a
[2:10:50] restricted power.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; They're kicked out of heaven.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're kicked out of all
[2:10:57] everything good and they're condemned
[2:10:58] prisoners waiting for their sentence to
[2:11:01] be carried out.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham, he he says this
[2:11:05] in in uh in 1963, there is only one way
[2:11:10] provided by God for anything. He says,
[2:11:13] if you notice, Lucifer is exactly doing
[2:11:15] the same thing today that he did in the
[2:11:18] beginning. See Lucifer in the beginning
[2:11:20] wanted to build himself a kingdom which
[2:11:22] was greater more beautiful than than
[2:11:24] Michael's kingdom Christ he
[2:11:28] um and he that was um his ambitions to
[2:11:32] achieve something like that what did he
[2:11:34] get by do um why what did he um what did
[2:11:39] he get to do it by he took fallen
[2:11:42] angels. So, how did he achieve his how
[2:11:45] did he accomplish this? By fallen angels
[2:11:48] who' lost. Now, brother Brandon's
[2:11:50] quoting Jude 6. Now,
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; this is just to back up that scripture.
[2:11:54] He says, who lost their first estate, he
[2:11:56] took that to do with it,
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; So, those angels who lost their first
[2:12:02] estate, that's who he took down. Those
[2:12:04] the the the third or the twothirds, the
[2:12:06] brother Brandham says he took them down
[2:12:08] with him. church
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; now the Bible it says in in Jude 6 it
[2:12:12] says that they left their habitation
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; right
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; now that word that changes everything
[2:12:17] that that's a Greek word called
[2:12:20] okotarian
[2:12:21] now okitarian it means a dwelling place
[2:12:24] a habitation for the body
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; as a dwelling place for the spirit now
[2:12:31] it's only recorded two times in the New
[2:12:34] Testament ever it's recorded here and
[2:12:37] it's recorded another place we're going
[2:12:39] to talk about, but but it's it's a
[2:12:42] dwelling place for a body.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; So, they were kicked out.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Here, brother Ben Brandham says in um
[2:12:51] question and answers on um Genesis
[2:12:53] preached in 1953. He says, "Now
[2:12:56] twothirds of the earth is in sin. more
[2:12:58] than that which is two uh thirds of the
[2:13:01] angels was kicked out and those demon
[2:13:02] spirits
[2:13:04] come into
[2:13:06] people uh he says um which twothirds of
[2:13:10] those angels was kicked out and those
[2:13:12] demon spirits so now he's saying those
[2:13:14] angels are those demon spirits come into
[2:13:18] people and now brother Bram's using the
[2:13:21] same uh language as Jude he says and
[2:13:24] habitate their body
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; correct
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; so They left their habitation
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; and now they come down and they're
[2:13:32] habitating
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; in what? A human body.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; See what I mean? They're demons.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; That once they once existed. Look at the
[2:13:41] way he's saying it. They once existed
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; and they come into people and give them
[2:13:46] a nature.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; So they got kicked out. Now just to be
[2:13:51] blunt now laying all this out, they kick
[2:13:53] got dis dislocated from their body.
[2:13:58] They they got tooken away. Why? Because
[2:14:00] Lucifer was all light.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; He couldn't keep that light. He was a
[2:14:06] lightbearer of God's own spirit. And
[2:14:08] God's like, I'm separating you from my
[2:14:11] spirit.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; I'm separating you from from everything
[2:14:14] good from from this earthly or this
[2:14:17] heavenly body.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; And he separates them. And now what are
[2:14:21] they? Demon spirits. Brother Brandham
[2:14:23] says
[2:14:25] now in adoption preached in 1960 he says
[2:14:28] adoption two he says and we just all be
[2:14:31] just that's exactly the truth if this
[2:14:33] earthly tabernacle now the look at how
[2:14:36] he says it if this earthly tabernacle of
[2:14:39] habitation now if you read that
[2:14:41] scripture it doesn't say habitation but
[2:14:43] brother Brandham says habitation
[2:14:45] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; so let's go to that scripture and see
[2:14:51] why brother Brandham said habitation.
[2:14:55] 2 Corinthians 5.
[2:14:58] I'm I'm trying not to be as uh
[2:15:00] confusing. I'm I'm trying to just lay it
[2:15:01] out. I pray that God
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; reveals it. 2 Corinthians 5 1:4.
[2:15:10] Now, this is a beautiful scripture.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; This is talking about when we die, where
[2:15:16] do we go? What happens to our body? Are
[2:15:18] we spirits?
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; Right? This is a great question. Brother
[2:15:21] Brandham had that question.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; He says, "For we know that our earthly
[2:15:25] house of this tabernacle were dissolved.
[2:15:28] We have a building of God." Now, think
[2:15:31] about it. He's talking about a house.
[2:15:33] He's talking about a temple. He's
[2:15:35] talking about habitations here.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; But we know what he's talking about.
[2:15:38] It's a body.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "If this this earthly house,
[2:15:43] who's that? You and I, this body of this
[2:15:46] tabernacle were dissolved. We have a
[2:15:49] building. Something's already up there.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Of God, an house not made with hands,
[2:15:54] eternal in the heavens.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; For in this we grown earnestly,
[2:15:59] desiring. Now look at what it says. To
[2:16:01] be clothed. What was Lucifer? He was
[2:16:04] covered
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; to be clothed with our house. Now that
[2:16:09] word house is that same word okitarian,
[2:16:13] that dwelling place for the spirit
[2:16:17] which is from heaven. If that it so be
[2:16:20] uh be if it so that be clothed that we
[2:16:23] shall not be found now listen what he
[2:16:25] says naked we for we are in this
[2:16:29] tabernacle we do groan being burdened
[2:16:32] not for what we would uh be unclothed
[2:16:35] but be clothed upon that mortality might
[2:16:37] swallow be swallowed up by life.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Now clothes what does it refer to? It
[2:16:44] refers to the spiritual body of a
[2:16:46] believer.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; Correct?
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; And he says, you know what? I I
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not I don't desire to be unclothed
[2:16:52] or naked. That's what he said.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Which means I don't want to be a what? A
[2:16:56] floating spirit.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; He said, I don't want to be naked. I
[2:17:00] don't want to be a floating spirit. He
[2:17:02] says, but God promised us another body.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So that when I die
[2:17:09] from this ground or my body goes to the
[2:17:11] ground, I go and I go to another body.
[2:17:13] Brother Brandham called it a theophony.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says there's already a
[2:17:20] heavenly body out there. It's our
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; theophony.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Now remember, whenever the resurrection
[2:17:26] comes, what happens? That teapony comes
[2:17:29] back and touches ground with that earth
[2:17:31] and now it's a glorified body.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Correct. Amen.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we don't want to be found
[2:17:38] naked. We don't want to be found what?
[2:17:41] As spirits,
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; kicked out of this body and just be
[2:17:45] what? Floating spirits. What? Desiring
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; to be clothed.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Desiring to to want to dwell into
[2:17:55] something.
[2:17:59] So to be found naked is is is a shame,
[2:18:03] right? That's right.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Anybody could say that with their right
[2:18:06] mind. It's illegal.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; So when we die, we have a body waiting
[2:18:12] because we don't want to be illegally
[2:18:14] roaming in this ground in this earth.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Why? God gave the dominion to the
[2:18:19] spirit, but he needed a body to touch
[2:18:22] the ground.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; So that he can have the dominion.
[2:18:27] So he gave the spirit dominion, but he
[2:18:30] gave the body so that he can work. So
[2:18:33] when the spirit is out, it's illegal.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; It's wrong.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham or or Paul says it it's
[2:18:41] you're naked.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here, brother Brandham says
[2:18:50] here, I'm just going to um read this
[2:18:53] because brother Brandham um we're going
[2:18:55] to see what is in his mind, how he felt
[2:18:58] here in uncertain sound in 61. He says,
[2:19:01] "Oh, I thought I always wanted to live
[2:19:05] um to live to see Jesus come because I
[2:19:08] never wanted to be a spirit."
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; I always was afraid of spooks and I
[2:19:13] didn't want to die because I didn't want
[2:19:15] to become a little cloud and and like a
[2:19:18] little white cloud floating around
[2:19:20] somewhere and see my brother and say,
[2:19:22] "Oh, there they are. Wished I could
[2:19:24] shake hands with him." Um but they they
[2:19:28] haven't gotten hand to shake with. is
[2:19:30] dead and and they're in the grave.
[2:19:33] And then I was made alive. Then um then
[2:19:37] was made alive that scripture. He goes
[2:19:40] back to the scripture we just read. If
[2:19:42] this earthly be earthly tabernacle be
[2:19:45] dissolved, we have one already waiting.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; So even brother Brandham gave his
[2:19:50] thoughts. I don't want to be a spirit.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; That's not the way. So to be found naked
[2:19:55] is that illegal and that's why we die.
[2:19:57] We have a body. So you cannot dwell in
[2:20:01] these natural dimensions as a spirit.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; God made a body so that you can your
[2:20:06] spirit God's spirit can operate in the
[2:20:09] earth. So when a body dies the spirit
[2:20:12] goes to a certain dimension depending on
[2:20:14] how they used to be
[2:20:17] and and and how they use that body.
[2:20:19] That's why it's important how are we
[2:20:21] using this temple.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; However using you're using this body
[2:20:25] that's where your spirit's going.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:20:28] Right?
[2:20:30] But remember your your your spirit it
[2:20:33] cannot stay there. Your even the body
[2:20:36] one day is wanting to come back because
[2:20:39] in the end of the day we are terrestrial
[2:20:42] creatures. We're not like the angels.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; So wherever they're at in this sixth
[2:20:46] dimension with this body, they're not at
[2:20:50] they're not satisfied.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Do you know that man? I just want to be
[2:20:55] a teophony. Well, that's not the way God
[2:20:58] made us. He wanted us to be glorified
[2:21:00] bodies.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; What does it mean? We could
[2:21:04] go through walls. We can go
[2:21:06] interdimensional. Yet, we can drink a
[2:21:08] bottle of water if we wanted to. That's
[2:21:10] what Jesus did.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus, what? His spirit went down to
[2:21:14] hell. His body was in the grave. And
[2:21:16] then they both met and he's like, "Man,
[2:21:18] I'm awfully hungry." Man, in his
[2:21:21] resurrection, that's all he was doing.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; Hey, break some bread. We're going to
[2:21:24] eat. Hey, cook the fish. We're going to
[2:21:26] eat.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; All right, I got to go. I'm walking
[2:21:28] through this wall.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; It's a different body. So, when we're up
[2:21:32] there in heaven, we're not satisfied
[2:21:34] because that's not we were not made like
[2:21:36] the angels to be just theophanes or to
[2:21:39] be uh spiritual bodies,
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; right? So, so I realized that even
[2:21:45] though we grown for our new house, um
[2:21:49] this is where our hope is. This is where
[2:21:51] our grace, this is even in this body
[2:21:53] when we desire to be changed. Remember
[2:21:56] that this is where
[2:21:59] your decisions are going to matter.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; In this body,
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; that's that's dying, that gets sick,
[2:22:05] that cries, that has all this emotion
[2:22:08] that that has all everything running
[2:22:10] through it.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; In this body, this is where it matters
[2:22:14] wherever you go. Right?
[2:22:17] So, I'm going to skip a few things. So
[2:22:21] Satan and his angels, they're
[2:22:23] essentially living this earth illegally.
[2:22:25] Then
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; because what are they? Spirits roaming
[2:22:29] around.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; What are they? Desiring to enter into a
[2:22:34] body.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the greatest
[2:22:37] battle ever fought, "A devil is almost
[2:22:39] harmless unless he has something to work
[2:22:42] in."
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; So these things are harmless.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Unless they can get into a body.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; That's correct. What happened to the man
[2:22:49] of Gadra?
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; The the these all the this legion was on
[2:22:54] him. And when the Oh, this is just a
[2:22:57] beautiful thing.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Where where one possessed man saw the
[2:23:01] other possessed man.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; This possessed man who was possessed of
[2:23:04] all these spirits finally saw God in
[2:23:08] human flesh.
[2:23:10] And when they saw him, they bowed and
[2:23:11] they said, "It's not time yet." Amen.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; I know you reserved uh judgment for us,
[2:23:16] but it's not time yet, Lord. He's like,
[2:23:18] "Get out of him."
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; He kicked those devils out.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; And what did those spirits do? They
[2:23:26] said, "Well, can I go to the pigs?"
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; What What were they? They're unagit.
[2:23:32] They cannot live and operate without a
[2:23:36] body.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; And when they went into those pigs, they
[2:23:39] went and the pigs went crazy.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; What does the Bible say? When an unclean
[2:23:43] spirit here in Luke uh 11:24 and 26,
[2:23:46] when an unclean spirit goes out of a
[2:23:48] man, he walketh in what? Dry places.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Seeking what? Rest. He's not happy.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; The devil's not happy. He's seeking
[2:23:59] rest.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; Finding none. He said, "I will return
[2:24:03] back to a borrowed house."
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; What did he say? I'm going back to my
[2:24:08] house.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Am I the house of the devil?
[2:24:12] He says, "I'm going back." He claimed
[2:24:14] he's trying to claim your body.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; He's trying to claim the people's body.
[2:24:18] He says, "I'm going back to my house."
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; And when he he cometh and find it swept
[2:24:23] and garnished, he goeth and take him up
[2:24:26] seven other spirits more wicked than
[2:24:28] himself and enter in and dwell therein.
[2:24:31] The last state of the man was worse than
[2:24:33] the first.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; So they cannot live without human
[2:24:37] beings. They were whatever happened in
[2:24:40] heaven, they were stripped from what
[2:24:43] they had,
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; And now they're they're trying to to
[2:24:46] live
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; in human beings. That's why one of these
[2:24:49] days, Brother Baron says, there'll be a
[2:24:51] superhuman on earth.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; That's going to take over this this
[2:24:55] whole earth. That's correct.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; What was it? It was it was the devil
[2:24:58] just like in Cain.
[2:25:01] He's he's completely uh possessed in a
[2:25:04] man.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:25:08] So if a if a demon could simply
[2:25:11] materialize, he would always cause havoc
[2:25:13] with humanity. But it wouldn't be
[2:25:15] constantly looking for somebody to to
[2:25:18] inhabit. So it's further indication that
[2:25:21] demons cannot appear at will in some
[2:25:26] uh humanike or some animal. He they have
[2:25:29] to allow him to be there.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:25:32] So now going into it now I I want to
[2:25:35] speed up because I don't want to go into
[2:25:37] this because there's a good part of
[2:25:39] this, right?
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; Um
[2:25:42] here why does Satan have the right?
[2:25:45] God created man in his image.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; God says man is in I made him for my
[2:25:51] temple.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; I made him in my image so that I can
[2:25:54] dwell in him. Why does he have the right
[2:25:58] to be a temp to uh make us his temple?
[2:26:01] make people his temple. Brother Brandham
[2:26:04] says in exposition of the seven church
[2:26:06] ages, Ephesians church age, he says,
[2:26:08] "Now, why did it have to be so?"
[2:26:12] Why is it that the seed of the serpent
[2:26:14] must come out this way? Man was created
[2:26:18] for God.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; Correct?
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; Man was to be a temple of God,
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; the place of God's rest. The Holy Spirit
[2:26:25] was man, the temple. Acts Acts 7:46-51
[2:26:30] who found favor before God and desired
[2:26:33] to find a tabernacle for Jacob but
[2:26:35] Solomon built a house. How be it the
[2:26:37] most high dwelleth not in the temples
[2:26:39] made with hands sayeth the prophet.
[2:26:42] Heaven is my throne and earth is my
[2:26:43] foottool. What house will you build me?
[2:26:45] Sayeth the Lord. Or what is the place of
[2:26:47] my rest? Hath not my hand made all these
[2:26:50] things? Then then um he says ye stiff
[2:26:54] necked uncircumcised in the hearts and
[2:26:56] ears always do resist the Holy Ghost as
[2:26:58] your fathers did. So do ye. Now brother
[2:27:00] Barham says Satan has known this all
[2:27:03] along.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; He knew why man was supposed was made
[2:27:07] the way he was.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; He knows why you're so special.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; He also wants to indwell man even as God
[2:27:16] does. But God has reserved himself that
[2:27:19] right.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the devil, he could not enter
[2:27:23] into man.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; God reserved that right for himself.
[2:27:27] Satan cannot do that. God alone appeared
[2:27:30] in human flesh. Satan could not do that.
[2:27:33] He does not have creative powers. The
[2:27:36] only way, now listen to this, the only
[2:27:39] way for Satan to accomplish what he
[2:27:41] wanted to do was enter the serpent of in
[2:27:44] Eden. Even as he entered into by evil
[2:27:48] spirits into the swine of gadra, God
[2:27:51] does not enter animals. But Satan can
[2:27:54] will can and will to do his to
[2:27:57] accomplish his ends.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; He could not have a child directly by
[2:28:01] Eve as as God did by Mary. So he entered
[2:28:05] into the serpent and begiled Eve. He
[2:28:07] seduced her by um by her. Did Satan have
[2:28:11] a child vicariously?
[2:28:13] So listen to this. Cain bore the full
[2:28:17] spiritual characteristics of Satan and
[2:28:20] anim animalistic central fleshly
[2:28:22] characteristics of the serpent.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; No wonder the Holy Spirit said Cain was
[2:28:27] of that wicked one.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; So why did he how was he able to have
[2:28:32] that right? was because he deceived Eve
[2:28:35] and he mixed those seeds.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; And now every person is is if if they're
[2:28:44] not careful, if they don't ask for the
[2:28:45] Holy Spirit, they're they're going to
[2:28:47] have to be dwelt, something's going to
[2:28:49] dwell in them.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; Cuz we are temples.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; But it was because of that situation,
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; the devil's able to come.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; The devil's able to torment people with
[2:29:01] sicknesses. The devil's able to torment
[2:29:03] people with mental illnesses and all
[2:29:05] those things. Why? Because he entered
[2:29:08] into the human race by injecting himself
[2:29:11] through the serpent.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; And when he she had Cain, he bore the
[2:29:15] full characteristics of Satan.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; And then what happened? Well, we, you
[2:29:21] know, just to give a little context,
[2:29:23] then the children of men
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; were were born and all the daughters of
[2:29:29] men were there. And then Seth's lineage
[2:29:32] came. Sons of God saw that the daughters
[2:29:34] of men were fair. And there was a
[2:29:36] mixture that happened.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; There was a mixture that happened. Now,
[2:29:41] everybody is born in this sinful evil
[2:29:44] nature.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; And it was carried outside of the ark
[2:29:50] and the other side.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham says in the
[2:29:54] true sign that's overlooked, he says,
[2:29:57] "But those who sometimes their soul is
[2:29:59] saved, but this old body belongs to
[2:30:02] Satan."
[2:30:04] And he knows that he'll take he'll take
[2:30:07] it at the end time. He'll crush it and
[2:30:09] send it back um till bugs and earth will
[2:30:11] crawl and eat it up. But he'll never
[2:30:14] touch the soul for its precious
[2:30:16] treasures of God. Amen.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; And through that life like out of a
[2:30:21] leaf, it returns back to God who give it
[2:30:24] will come forth in the next season with
[2:30:26] a new body that Satan can never touch.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; Neither can that old age ever anything
[2:30:32] else ever touch it. It'll be a glorified
[2:30:35] body. We're looking for that Lord.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; So right now the devil, he'll he's going
[2:30:41] to throw sickness.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; He's going to try to make people
[2:30:45] depressed. He's going to try to cause
[2:30:47] anxiety. He's going to try to do those
[2:30:49] because he somehow he's got a little bit
[2:30:51] of that right. But one day, he's not
[2:30:54] going to be able to touch that.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; You can see that in that contending for
[2:31:00] Moses' body. Why? He had the right
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; he contended with with with Michael. He
[2:31:07] says, "This is my body. What are you
[2:31:08] doing?" And God, this is the amazing
[2:31:10] thing. God's like, "Now, I don't care. I
[2:31:12] don't I don't play by your rules." Amen.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; And what did he do? He took that body.
[2:31:16] Brother Brandham says that he was
[2:31:18] resurrected.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; Even though saying no, that's you
[2:31:23] haven't died on the cross yet.
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; You haven't resurrected. How could you
[2:31:28] resurrect a man? Man,
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; that's something that I don't even
[2:31:32] understand.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; How could a man be raptured before
[2:31:35] Jesus?
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; How could a body be resurrected in and
[2:31:39] and before Jesus? Praise the Lord,
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; man. Only God knows.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; And the devil's like, "This is my
[2:31:46] right."
[2:31:49] So
[2:31:50] now you have this this great this shadow
[2:31:54] in the Old Testament of of people
[2:31:57] fighting for God, but but they're
[2:31:59] separated
[2:32:01] and and Satan feels like he has
[2:32:03] everything. He he's he's got human
[2:32:06] flesh. He he's making them into animals.
[2:32:10] And you see that today.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; You see people hating each other. This
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; this story of just people hating each
[2:32:18] other for
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; for religion, for for a different color,
[2:32:24] for for having a different thought, for
[2:32:26] having a different political view.
[2:32:27] People are hating each other.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; There's there's a genuine hatred. And
[2:32:33] what is it? It's it's the devil
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; just pulling the strings.
[2:32:37] It's the devil doing all these things,
[2:32:39] making people like this,
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; making people weak, making people hate,
[2:32:45] making people lie, making people cheat,
[2:32:48] making people do these things. The
[2:32:50] devil's doing that.
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; The devil thinks he has control.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; The devil thinks he could do all these
[2:32:57] things.
[2:33:00] Oh, I got the control. I can do whatever
[2:33:02] I want.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; I deceived my way. And then you just see
[2:33:06] the world and it's just such a sad
[2:33:08] situation in this world.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; There's this picture that I was thinking
[2:33:11] of actually when I was I was here last
[2:33:14] night.
[2:33:16] I think it's called Agnes.
[2:33:19] Some people call it Agnes Day, which is
[2:33:21] the lamb of God. And it's this lamb. I
[2:33:24] think it was painted in 19202.
[2:33:27] And it's this lamb just this peaceful
[2:33:30] little lamb with with a halo, a golden
[2:33:33] halo over himself and just these seven
[2:33:36] wolves just tearing it to pieces.
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; One on the foot, the other one on the
[2:33:40] chest, the other one on the neck and
[2:33:42] these all these wolves are looking at
[2:33:45] this lamb and and in their eyes there's
[2:33:48] that golden light that is reflecting
[2:33:50] from that halo. And I started to think I
[2:33:53] said, "You know what? That's our human
[2:33:55] nature.
[2:33:57] When Christ came down,
[2:34:00] Christ didn't come down as as this great
[2:34:02] Caesar. He didn't come as this great
[2:34:05] conqueror. Let's we're going to change
[2:34:07] the nations and we're going to do this
[2:34:08] and he came as a little lamb.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; His nature was different because there
[2:34:14] was no evil. There was no inherent devil
[2:34:16] in there.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; There was just God in flesh.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; And he began to show the true beauty of
[2:34:23] God's character. Not outward beauty, not
[2:34:26] fleshly beauty. It was a character
[2:34:28] inside.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; He showed what true humanity should be.
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; A man filled with the Holy Spirit,
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; having dominion with the in the earth.
[2:34:38] And how did he do it? I am the greatest.
[2:34:40] I am the best. I will conquer all
[2:34:41] things. No, he was a little lamb. And
[2:34:43] all the wolves, that's me.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; All the evil, that's me,
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; was looking at him. All of my sins, put
[2:34:53] him in that cross.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; All of my hatred,
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; they did
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; put him in that cross.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; Everything that I've done, put him in
[2:35:02] that cross.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; Everything that you've done.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm I don't do anything wrong.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; God knows.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; God knows every single little thing.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Us, we put him there
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; on that cross. Amen.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; The Bible says,
[2:35:24] now I just love the picture of John
[2:35:27] crying there in in Revelations,
[2:35:31] seeing seeing this picture, this in
[2:35:33] symbol form of this earth and what's
[2:35:35] going on and and seeing that no one was
[2:35:39] worthy to take the book of redemption,
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; this this get the right back to man. And
[2:35:46] and John is looking at this in symbol
[2:35:49] form and he's crying. He begins to cry.
[2:35:52] He says, "Nobody's worthy.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; I know my name's in that book and I'm
[2:35:57] done. Nobody's worthy." And as he's
[2:36:00] crying, an elder says, "Don't cry."
[2:36:03] He says, "The lamb is worthy."
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; He actually says, "The lion of the tribe
[2:36:08] of Judah." And when he looked when he
[2:36:10] looked at trying to look for the
[2:36:12] greatest king ever, he saw a slang lamb.
[2:36:15] Amen.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:21 it says, "And ye were
[2:36:21] sometimes alienated and enemies in your
[2:36:23] mind by by your wicked works. Yet now he
[2:36:27] hath he reconciled
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; in a body of his flesh through death to
[2:36:34] represent you holy and unblamable
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; and unreprovable in his sight."
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; How did he reconcile me? In a body.
[2:36:43] Yeah,
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; God had to come the legal way.
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; Correct?
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; See, Brother Brandham says the devil's
[2:36:49] almost harmless if he doesn't have
[2:36:51] something. But then he says God does the
[2:36:54] same way.
[2:36:56] He says he's depending on us to work
[2:36:59] through.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; God can't do anything unless he has a
[2:37:03] body to work through. And he came down
[2:37:06] in a form of a human flesh. He came down
[2:37:09] in the body of Jesus Christ to help.
[2:37:12] Amen.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says, "If you'd
[2:37:16] like to stand with me and the musicians
[2:37:18] would come."
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "A little while
[2:37:22] from then, the world was going to
[2:37:24] receive the greatest gift that he ever
[2:37:27] received. Lord,
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; a little package wrapped up."
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; A little first Christmas package that
[2:37:33] was ever wrapped in the world, God
[2:37:35] wrapped it up. Yes.
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; I want to break in in on my thought and
[2:37:40] say this that the greatest thing that
[2:37:42] ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped
[2:37:45] in it. God himself wrapped himself his
[2:37:48] own self in a Christmas package and sent
[2:37:51] to the world.
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; He also says in why he had to be a
[2:37:55] shepherd. He says let us just close our
[2:37:58] eyes and think of Jehovah.
[2:38:00] No one was worthy. No one could no one
[2:38:02] but could do it but him. He come down
[2:38:06] become a little baby. Think about it.
[2:38:10] A a little baby wrapped the whole
[2:38:14] eternal God.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; He become a little baby. He come a a
[2:38:20] teenager and he become a carpenter and a
[2:38:23] working man.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; He became a lamb.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; He became a sacrificed. He raised
[2:38:30] triumphy as Jehovah.
[2:38:33] And as Moses pulled his hand from the
[2:38:35] first of uh from his bosom over his
[2:38:37] heart, God pulled his hand from the
[2:38:40] bosom of his secret. His son was smitten
[2:38:44] with disease and sin unccurable. He
[2:38:47] stuck it back in his bosom again and he
[2:38:50] pulled it forth and extended to you and
[2:38:52] I. Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[2:38:56] today, and forever.
[2:38:58] God wrapped himself in and into into
[2:39:00] flesh all of eternity restrained in a
[2:39:03] human being. He put himself into
[2:39:06] subjection to the flesh of and to
[2:39:08] sickness to sorrow to tiredness to
[2:39:11] everything we're expecting experiencing.
[2:39:15] He felt it
[2:39:19] when it was the most critical time when
[2:39:21] the devil had the whole world in his
[2:39:23] hands. God came the legal way.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; That's why everything we do, we do it in
[2:39:33] him.
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; There the Bible says in unveiling of
[2:39:42] God, he says now he was behind the veil.
[2:39:45] He was behind what? Skin veil. See
[2:39:48] badger skins behind that veil. And there
[2:39:51] the veil was rent on the day of
[2:39:53] crucifixion. Now the best thing of a a
[2:39:56] gift is is opening up the wrapping
[2:39:59] paper.
[2:40:01] &gt;&gt; He he wrapped it up and he says here the
[2:40:04] veil is rent
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; on the day of crucifixion.
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; He says that and and that veil was rent
[2:40:11] on the day of crucifixion. That veil
[2:40:13] that he was wrapped in was rent on that
[2:40:16] day of crucifixion. whole the whole
[2:40:19] mercy seat came to view because he died
[2:40:23] because he became flesh. He died for our
[2:40:26] sins.
[2:40:27] Now all of mercy is in view. Not only
[2:40:32] that, but now now it's not Christ over
[2:40:35] there. Now it's not Emanuel, God with
[2:40:37] us. But now it could be God in us.
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; Now you are that earthn vessel.
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; You are that gift to the world. True.
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; You are that temple that God wants to
[2:40:49] dwell in. Christ in you, the hope of
[2:40:51] glory.
[2:40:53] &gt;&gt; Now you become part of him.
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; You veve all of eternity inside of you.
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says that he was God's
[2:41:04] wrapped package and then it was opened
[2:41:07] and then he rewrapped it again in the
[2:41:09] sons of God. He says
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; there was one time where Philip asked
[2:41:15] Christ, he says, "Let us see God. Let us
[2:41:18] see the father."
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus looked at him and he says,
[2:41:23] "Haven't haven't I been with you for so
[2:41:25] long."
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; When you see me, you see the father.
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; Brother, don't we want to see God?
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; Look around.
[2:41:37] Look around at a genuine Christian.
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; When you see them, you see the Father.
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; When you see them, you see Christ.
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; Because Christ is here to dwell in you,
[2:41:49] to operate through you
[2:41:52] to bring back everything that was lost.
[2:41:55] He's redeeming it back through his
[2:41:57] bride.
[2:41:59] Let us bow our heads.
[2:42:01] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just want to
[2:42:04] give you the honor and the glory.
[2:42:08] What a horrible scene that we've we're
[2:42:11] not only seeing, but we're living
[2:42:13] through, Father.
[2:42:15] All this this backbiting, this evil,
[2:42:18] this hate that we look we look for to
[2:42:20] our left, we look to our right, we look
[2:42:22] front and back, and we just see hatred,
[2:42:25] we see evil.
[2:42:27] But God, you reserved souls. You
[2:42:31] reserved people to shine the light.
[2:42:35] Your light, Father, your treasure, your
[2:42:37] gift. Lord, I ask that each and every
[2:42:40] person here is a recipient of that. Each
[2:42:44] and every person is that lightbearer.
[2:42:47] Each and every person is that person
[2:42:49] that bears the Holy Spirit and wherever
[2:42:51] they go, they're showing not beauty but
[2:42:54] the character of God.
[2:42:57] Lord, I thank you, Jesus. I thank you
[2:42:59] for them, Father. And I thank you for
[2:43:01] the beautiful day when you came, Father.
[2:43:04] All of heaven, all of earth was
[2:43:06] rejoicing in that day.
[2:43:09] We thank you Jesus. We give you the
[2:43:12] glory and the honor in the name of the
[2:43:13] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. Amen.
[2:43:21] Praise the Lord. Let's just sing this
[2:43:24] worship hymn together.

[2:49:36] We are grateful there Lord
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; because you are a faithful God.

[2:49:45] because you have found people like us,
[2:49:48] people like me
[2:49:51] that you wrapped yourselves
[2:49:54] &gt;&gt; in me, in my brother, in my sister.

[2:50:01] &gt;&gt; We give you praise. We give you glory.
[2:50:05] &gt;&gt; We give you honor.
[2:50:07] &gt;&gt; The entire heaven wrapped himself
[2:50:12] just for me.
[2:50:14] &gt;&gt; Went to the cross, paid a price
[2:50:18] because of me.
[2:50:21] &gt;&gt; Glory be to you, Lord.
[2:50:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you for this great love. The Bible
[2:50:27] say no greater love than this that he
[2:50:31] that the father that God
[2:50:34] himself. No greater love than this.
[2:50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; That God loves me. Yes. Amen.
[2:50:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you for that great love. Thank you
[2:50:43] for that wonderful love for us, for the
[2:50:47] world.
[2:50:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, because you have
[2:50:50] prepared an habitation for us.
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Father. We are
[2:50:56] grateful, Lord, for everything you've
[2:50:58] done. We appreciate you because when I
[2:51:01] see my brother, I see the glory of God
[2:51:05] in him.
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Thank you for giving
[2:51:09] yourself to us. The Bible says it's not
[2:51:13] because we first loved him, but because
[2:51:15] he first loved us. We thank you for that
[2:51:19] love.
[2:51:20] And we appreciate you, Lord, for how you
[2:51:24] used your son, our brother, to reveal
[2:51:27] the deep secrets,
[2:51:30] &gt;&gt; revelation from the word.
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We are grateful today
[2:51:36] and we're happy that you found us.
[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; We're happy
[2:51:42] that you dwell in us.
[2:51:46] We give you glory, Lord. We are so
[2:51:49] grateful, Father. We honor your name.
[2:51:53] Thank you because the devil does not
[2:51:54] have the right to dwell in us
[2:51:57] &gt;&gt; because you reserve the right.
[2:52:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. We are grateful Lord
[2:52:04] and we pray Lord that we ourselves will
[2:52:09] not give the devil a place in us.
[2:52:13] &gt;&gt; We will not allow the devil to come into
[2:52:15] us
[2:52:16] and Lord we give up. We open up our
[2:52:20] hearts
[2:52:21] &gt;&gt; that you come in into your habitation.
[2:52:25] &gt;&gt; Come and dwell here Lord. Come and dwell
[2:52:27] in us Lord. Not just in the building,
[2:52:30] but I will carry you everywhere. But I
[2:52:33] will take you everywhere. But I will
[2:52:36] show forth that glory of yours to the
[2:52:40] world around us and shine that light.
[2:52:43] Cuz Christ say we are the light of the
[2:52:45] world. A city that is set on an hill
[2:52:48] cannot be hidden. Lord, I pray that our
[2:52:51] life will not be hidden
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; from the darkness of this world. Lord,
[2:52:56] you will shine forth your light. You
[2:52:58] will show forth your glory and we will
[2:53:01] live to honor you. And Lord, as we
[2:53:04] dismiss, I pray, Lord, will be carriers
[2:53:08] of your glory. We will go with you
[2:53:10] everywhere. We take you everywhere,
[2:53:12] Lord. And as the food has been prepared,
[2:53:15] Lord, we pray you bless them, you
[2:53:18] sanctify them, and it will be useful for
[2:53:21] our bodies, Lord. Yes.
[2:53:23] &gt;&gt; And Lord, as we continue in this
[2:53:26] experience of carrying you about,
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray your name will be
[2:53:32] glorified. And that day, Lord, where all
[2:53:35] of us will gather in that heavenly
[2:53:38] kingdom to be with the Lord forever. The
[2:53:41] Bible says, "And so shall we be with the
[2:53:44] Lord." Lord, we pray. I rejoice. We
[2:53:48] rejoice ever more in the presence of the
[2:53:51] Lord. Thank you Lord. We know you have
[2:53:54] answered us. We are grateful because you
[2:53:57] have done all things well. Blessed be
[2:53:59] your name. For in Jesus mighty name we
[2:54:03] have prayed. Amen.
[2:54:06] &gt;&gt; Amenise.
[2:54:09] Amen. No service on this Wednesday. Um,
[2:54:13] looks like we got some weather coming in
[2:54:16] Tuesday through Friday, Saturday, and
[2:54:17] then funeral on Sunday for Sister Vivian

[2:54:23] like to attend. And may you, did I say

[2:54:29] funeral. Amen. Thank you for keeping me
[2:54:32] in line. I need God's wrapped gift to
[2:54:34] keep me in line, too. Praise the Lord.
