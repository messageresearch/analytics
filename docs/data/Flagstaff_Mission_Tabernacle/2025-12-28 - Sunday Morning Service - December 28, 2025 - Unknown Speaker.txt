May you take it and Lord Jesus, may it be used for your purpose. May everything be done for your honor and glory in Jesus name. Amen. Whatever's on your heart. Just a few announcements this morning. Sunday school, there was 13 Christians, 12 Bibles, and a dollar in [music] the offering. And then starting January 4th, every Sunday evening at 5:00 p.m. There'll be some Spanish services in the fellowship hall. Um, New Year's Eve [music] service will be here at the church at 10:30. And then Sunday the 18th, um, Brother Isaac Hatfield will be here. So, amen. Pray will [singing and music] turning. No will fire is burning. Just a little walk with Jesus [music] makes it right. [singing] Heat. Heat. [singing and music] [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; by when you feeling [music] all the fire is burning with Jesus [music and singing] makes it right. I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in and then [singing] life [music] from heaven to my soul. with [singing and music] my heart in love and roll my name above and just walk [singing] with Jesus. [music] Let us walk with Jesus. [music] Tell them all our trles. He will [singing] hear our face. He will answer by and [singing] [music] when you feel your little fire is burning. Find a little talk [music and singing] with Jesus makes it right. Sister Cammy and Sister Liz, you have a song. Amen. Maybe as she makes ready, we'll sing uh we bless your name, KFC, just as they make ready. Amen. We bless your name. [music] We bless [singing] your name. [music] We give [singing] you all give you praise. You [singing] are the life, the truth, the way. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; We bless your name. We bless your name. Thanks. God bless you. Feel free to sing along. Just feel like giving the devil a kick in the teeth this morning. So, Got it. Hear the cries [singing] of the shackled from the onset [singing] of time. For the chains of defeat, [singing] there's no king. [music] See the tears [singing] of the broken, the cries [singing and music] of the slaves. Is there no [singing] one worthy to set us free? Then the crying is [singing] still as the [music] chorus rings [singing] out. Sh gold released from [singing] their church chains [music] and thousands [singing] of voices are swelling [singing and music] the song. Worthy, [singing] worthy is the lamb. Worthy, [singing and music] worthy, [music] [singing] worthy. The lamb that [singing] was slain. [music] Then all the archangels, [singing] [music] the saints of all time, holding [singing] their crumbs [music] in their hands, fall [singing] down before him, [music] joining [singing] the song. Worthy, worthy [singing] is the lamb. Oh, worthy, [singing] worthy, worthy. [singing] The lamb that was slain. Oh, praise [music] him. [singing] Praise him. [singing] Praise the lamb [singing] that was slain. Oh worthy, [singing] worthy, [music] [singing] worthy. The lamb [singing] that was slain. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's worthy of all our praise. Uh while the offering was the offering prayer was being prayed, that song came to my mind and I was going to sing it and then I just turned and felt stopped and have sister Cammy play a different song and that was why. But I still think that we should stand as the pastor comes and let's just sing it to him. Just tell him how worthy he is. Just love him. Just serve him. Just just worship. [music] And I'm not I'm not trying to pull, but I do do believe that we should worship like it was our last opportunity. Listen to the word like it was our last opportunity. If it if I was [music] going to have a conversation with somebody one last time, I would get as deep as I could. I would tell them I love them. And so I just want to do that now as the pastor [music] comes. Just even if you don't sing, maybe just raise your hand, tell him how much you love him or he's worthy of it all. Amen. Worthy. You're worthy. [music] Oh, worthy. The lamb [singing and music] that was slain. Worthy. [music] Oh, [singing] you're worthy. [music] Oh, worthy. The [singing and music] lamb that was slain. Worthy. [music] Oh, you're worthy. [music] Yes, you're [singing] worthy. [music] Oh, worthy. The lamb [singing and music] that was slain. Oh worthy. [music] Oh worthy. [music] Oh worthy. The lamb that was slain. Love him. Love him. Make it personal. Sing I love you. I love you. [music] Oh, I love you. [music] I love [singing] the [music] lamb that was slain. [singing] Oh, I love you. [music] I love you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I love the lamb [singing] [music] that was slain. He's worthy. Oh worthy, [music] worthy. [music] worthy lamb that was [music] bless you this morning. I think we should just go right to the word and if you have your Bibles, turn with me to the book of Job, the 14th chapter. Job chapter 14. Read a few of the beginning verses there. Good to see everyone out this morning. Came prepared because we've been having trouble with some of the microphones. So, I came up with an extra pair of batteries. So, if we have to put them in, we'll just put them in and keep going. Um, thank the Lord. This yesterday we had um [clears throat] funeral for sister Vivian. It's interesting. The Lord allowed her to come here for about six months and we didn't know but it would be the last six months that she would be here on earth. And uh I posted something on our page yesterday. There was about four minutes of songs uh in Navajo that they sung during the service and it really blessed my heart. If you want to go online and look at that, there was probably 200 250 believers Navajo brothers and sisters here yesterday and filled up the building and sang in Navajo and really blessed my heart listening to him and I don't know, Lord has a he's got a great purpose. Yes, she does. &gt;&gt; The piano player said she hadn't played the piano in six years and her parents have been praying for her to come back to the Lord. And she played and then she went downstairs and played for three hours. And at the end she said she said I my heart is just something changed in it when I was playing and it just she didn't know how to express it. But what she was saying was that her soul was healed &gt;&gt; uh when she got to play and be in the presence of the Lord. She had been away from him for a long time. So God is doing something and I just believe it and I see it with our brothers and sisters and I I pray that he just continue. We don't know why he sent brother Fritz here. We don't know why he sent sister Vivian here. We don't know but he has a great purpose and we believe it. And so they asked me to speak the message which I took was a great privilege being that she was only here a few months and she had told her daughter that she liked our preaching. So, I don't know how good her discernment. No, I'm just but she but she says she she liked it. We might have you do the message. And I I there's a couple messages brother Brandon preaches. There are funerals. One is for Garnet Peak and there's another one. And I got the inspiration from that. And then this morning it was kind of I couldn't get away from it, you know. So, it's not a funeral service, but a funeral service is actually for the believer. It's a celebration. So, we want uh to celebrate this morning, even though we're missing our sister, but let's let's focus on what we have, which is uh promise uh first fruits. What did Paul call it? The It's like the the down payment. What did he call it? Earnest. We have the earnest of that resurrection. So, praise the Lord. Job in the 14th chapter and just read the first couple verses. He says, "Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower and is cut down. He fleth also as a shadow and contin thou open thine eyes upon such an one and bringest me into judgment with thee." He asked a great question there. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we thank you this morning. Lord, I in my spirit I really wanted to be out here as the congregation was worshiping, but uh could just feel your presence already, Lord, in the back room. Just one person, Lord, just one amen would change the entire uh service, Lord, the entire anointing that would come. And so, we thank you for that, Lord. And you, as Isaac said, you sent two or three this morning. We thank you for every heart that's gathered here, Lord. They come here with a need. We don't know what that need is, but you've already prepared the the the way to meet the need, the gift that that need would need. Lord, you've already prepared it. We don't know what it is. And but we thank you for that ahead of time. We'd ask you to speak to our hearts this morning. Be with us, Lord. Be with us in spirit and through the truth of your word. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. You may be seated. And as another announcement, I'm sure brother Isaac mentioned it. We haven't done a watch night New Year's Eve in many, many years. I can't remember. I felt it on my heart to do it again. So, that's why I know it's late. I'm going to take a nap halfway through the day to make sure I can stay up myself. And so, we'll start at 10:30. And then we're going to have some of the the ministers and the deacons, brother Mitchell, that includes you and might have brother Brandon or whoever's here, the young men that's got little little I say little. It's a gift from God. You have gifts in your life. And so, we'll have you talk and and take five or 10 minutes to talk to the congregation. Brother Ryan should be back. He's in Colorado this morning. And I failed to mention Brother Tom. Actually, I'm going to say a quick prayer for Brother Tom. He's homesick this morning with bronchitis. So, we want to remember brother Tom in prayer. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, forgive me. But you allowed it to be brought to my mind again about our brother and sister at home, Lord, at Bronitis. And so, we'd ask that you'd touch their bodies, be with them, Lord, wherever they would be at home or wherever. just just send your ministering angels and spirits to them in this moment. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. And also, Brother George Smith announced a trip to Israel, April 26th or May 10th. There's two of them. Uh I've encouraged you to go if you' if you'd want to. Uh April 26th, the first one. They go for about 10 days or 12 days. And then May 10th starts the second one or May 11th. So, if you can go to Israel with Brother George, I'm sure that you'd appreciate it. Who's been? I know Brother Curt, Sister Olivia's been, Brother Ray, Sister Kathy, a few of you has been. Brother Isaac and I went a few years ago. So, uh, if you can make that, just ask us for a flyer. Job in to start a funeral service. It was it seemed kind of odd. I apologized. And yesterday I had an interpreter and it was a Navajo interpreter and I've never and it seemed like he took longer to explain things which is understandable cuz it's, you know, they don't have everything that we have in our English. So maybe he took a little while to to explain it. And so it was odd. And so I I kind of had a little bit left over if I could say that this morning of anointing or just just the thought on this. And and Job says man that's born of woman is of few days. And then he talks about the invited guest that is actually here with us this morning because no matter what you would you would you would say the Lord is with us this morning. We invited him and he's here. Whether two or three are gathered, he's here. But there's also the thought of an uninvited guest or a guest that we know is going to come at some point. If if if the Lord with Terry, uh there's been nobody that's been able to defeat death but the Lord Jesus and Enoch, I guess. And maybe there might be one other I'm not thinking of, but but aside from that, death is is going to be there if the Lord carries. And it's going to be something that you're going to have to face. Now, Job calls it trouble, but the fact is that if the Lord carries, and I'm, you know, as you get older, I'm not old yet, but 48. So, I'm starting to approach that 50 and and then I can wait till you 55, I can get some discounts. And unfortunately, sometimes when I go to the restaurant, Brother Brandon, they look at me and they just already provide it. And so I appreciate that. That's fine. But you know, death is there and Job calls it troubles and sometimes we pre pre we we think it's not there or we pretend it's not there, but it is there. And you when you're 20, you don't think about it as much. But as you get older, you realize, you know, and as you you start last night with some of the kids, I went to play basketball a little bit and after about two runs to the basket and back, I was done. I was out of breath. Well, all that is is the beginnings of this body dying. That's just what it is. You just got to face it. That that that's what it is. and there's no escape from it if the Lord would terry. Now, if he doesn't tar, there's something else great that we'll talk about that could happen. But, but if he comes tomorrow and you're ready and you've been prepared and you've accepted the earnest of that resurrection, then guess what? You actually like Enoch get to escape the the death that would be there. But other than that, so so we don't want to face the fact sometimes that he's here. We would call him death, but Job calls him trouble. And and Job's going through a lot of trouble. He acknowledges him. He recognizes him. And the Bible says or brother Benham taught us, but the Bible uh concurs that uh that Job feared something and the and he says, "The thing that I greatly feared is come upon me." It's Job 3 and verse 25. I'm sorry I didn't get the scriptures to you, Sister Pauline, but Job 3 and verse 25. It says this, "For the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come upon me." So Job, those are two different Hebrew words. One is one is more like a dread, like a deep trembling fear, and the other one's something that you would be afraid of. And and so Job is afraid of these things, and he's he's done things in his life to prepare just in case it would happen. But but the fact of the matter is that there's a there's a special trial that's been prepared, as we mentioned many times, just for you. And and for Job, it was the the thing he greatly feared, and he tried to prepare as much as he could. And he, you know, he would even for his children, he would knew that that maybe they, Brother Bam said, they went and they married over here and they married over there and they went off where where he didn't think that they should have gone off and and so just in case they didn't lay down the sacrifice and burn it and offer it like they should, he offered one for him. So just to be sure, you know, he applied the token, if we could say it like that, just to be sure that his children, you know, he had everything in order. Brother Beam says this morning we turned over to Job. Mentally speaking, found Job living under the days of the offering and the burnt offering. And he thought maybe that because that his children might have sinned some way that they didn't understand that they had sinned. Job made a burnt offering for his children just to be sure. He says to be sure. I like that. Don't you interest in your children making a burnt offering. Offering. And now today it's like this. Lord, my children HAVE GONE OFF. LORD, THEY don't even know where they're at. They've lost their mind. They've gone a way that I don't think they should have gone. But then you offer up that prayer, you're doing no different THAN WHEN JOB LAID down the sacrifice of the LAMB AND HE PUT IT ON THE ALTAR AND he slayed it and he did THAT FOR HIS CHILDREN just to be sure, just in case that they didn't do it. He offered up a prayer, brother M says, under the sacrifice of a sheep's death that his children would not be lost if they had sinned, that God would forgive them of their sins. And and I'll give you a little secret this morning. The last couple weeks, uh, we've been in prayer and I put a list of all the children that I grew up with in this assembly that I don't see here anymore. &gt;&gt; And I counted over 30. I think it's like 35 that I grew up with that that they might have moved out. And you know what? I put them on a list and I wrote their name down. And I'm doing what Joette just in case Lord that that they there's they forgot or they went off or or or by circumstances many times in the church because because quite frankly men fail and then we look at the man and and then we see him fall and then we blame the man or the message because we saw the man fall and and so now it's the message's fault and we leave the message or we leave Christ altogether if we could say it like that. And and so many of my friends has done that. they seen that that something and they put the blame on, you know, the message or they put the blame ON CHRIST. WELL, I'M OFFERING A sacrifice for them. You know, I had one brother on my list and and I'd just been praying for him for about a week and you KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? GOD PUT HIM IN MY PATH THE VERY next day at Safeway and I thought, "PRAISE GOD, YOU KNOW, GOD, I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR THIS BROTHER AND AT SAFEWAY, I JUST HAPPENED to run into him." I didn't just happen to RUN INTO HIM. I'VE BEEN OFFERING A SACRIFICE for that brother and God put him in my path. If you do that for your children, just to be sure. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Oh, by the way, many of your children is on that list, too. Praise God. And I'm I'm not giving up on them. &gt;&gt; I pray that we just all of a sudden we just see them all walk through the building and we we just start offering up prayers for your children. &gt;&gt; God can do such a miracle. I mean, he can do a great miracle. So, Job does that and and he he's But see, there's something and I'm gonna just bear with me a minute because he's he's afraid of something. He says, "The thing that I feared come upon me." Well, what come upon him? He lost everything. And maybe that, you know, just losing everything was what he feared, but but it started out with the death of his children. Well, he had that covered, you know, he laid down the sacrifice and and he had done that. He put that under the token. He'd offered up for his children and so did that. And then, but he lost his cattle and his sheep and his oxen and his land, everything. You know, the enemy came in and burned it all and and so he lost that. Do you know he even lost his own his own skin? &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; I mean, he was sitting on the ash heap with a with a pot shirt, I think the Bible said, and he was scraping the boils. And and later on, he says something like this, "Though my skin worms will destroy this flesh." Well, guess what? He's probably looking at the very skin worms in the process of destroying his flesh. And he looks at HIM. HE SAYS, "NO, YOU GUYS WOULD DESTROY this flesh. in this very flesh I'll see my God. And so guess what? He's a He maybe was afraid that he would lose his very health. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Or maybe he was afraid his wife would turn against him. &gt;&gt; And all of those things happened everyone. He lost his children. He lost his property. He lost his economy if we could say it like that. He lost his he lo, you know, he lost his health and his wife turned against him. &gt;&gt; But death is really nothing to fear. And this morning, I want to I want to word it like this. I'm trying not to get too ahead of myself, but but there's something to be said for facing the fear that you have &gt;&gt; for facing that thing. &gt;&gt; Cuz Job, it was like the thing that he greatly feared came upon him. Well, God put the thing that he greatly feared upon him right in front of him. So, he had to face it. &gt;&gt; But I wonder and not that you can escape it because you have to face it. whatever the thing is that you greatly fear. And I've had thing in in my own life, I've got things that I've feared in my life. And it just so happens that in the last several years, God has put the things that I greatly that I was afraid of and that MY WHOLE LIFE THAT I WOULD, YOU KNOW, THAT I would prevent that it wouldn't happen to me. Well, you can't prevent the thing that you greatly fear from HAPPENING TO YOU. GOD IS GOING TO [screaming] PUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE THE GREATEST fear that you have. And I know it's a it's a it's a it's a strong thought. I know that. But I'm tell I'm talking this morning from experience that the thing Job greatly feared the greatest anxiety that he had that his children might not make it or or that his wife would lose everything. THE GREATEST FEAR that he had come upon him. He had to face it. What is the fear that the anxiety that you have this morning? I was talking to a young man the other day and he began to pour out his heart. And you know, I understand young people, the the world is not like it was when when we when we grew up. You know, it's very different for you young people on the front row here. IT'S IT'S IT'S A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT than when we grew up. And now their whole system that the world had is created to put anxiety on you. And this young man was saying, "Well, I don't I don't know what I'm going to do if I don't make it through college. Can I have a job? I don't want to work fast food my whole life." and and then I can't, you know, I can't get married unless I have a job and I can't afford a house and and he began to pour out all these things and I be I began to understand and to intercede with him all the the anxiety and the fear and and the fact is you got to face that thing and you're not getting through it. You're not getting through that you don't have a house, you don't have a job and and you don't have a spouse, you don't have you're NOT GETTING THROUGH ALL THAT UNLESS YOU FACE that thing and then YOU DO ONE NOT just you face it because you try to face it alone, you lose. &gt;&gt; Amen. it's not going to make it. But when you face that thing, TAKE THE [screaming] LORD GOD ALMIGHTY WITH YOU AND TAKE HIM WITH YOU TO FACE THAT THING AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE. BUT BUT IF YOU TRY TO DO IT ALONE AND YOU SAY, YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO GO get a job and and I'm going to make some money and I'm going to, you know, I'm going to buy a house and I'm going to get a wife and and I'm going to do these things, if you try to do it alone, you'll fail AND GOD WILL STRIP it all from YOU UNTIL YOU FACE IT WITH HIM AT YOUR SIDE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OKAY. So that's what happened &gt;&gt; with Job. He was forced to face it. He was forced to to look him right in the eye and to have a battle face to face with that thing. He might have tried to to turn from it, but he lived a perfect life. But he might have he might have tried to turn from that thing and not face it. But God stripped everything from him and forced him to face the very fear that he had. The worst fear, the greatest fear, the great thing that he feared had come upon him. Jesus said in Matthew 10:28, he says, "Fear not them which kill the body." [sighs] &gt;&gt; Don't fear them. Jesus said, "Fear not." I don't know if I have it on a slide. I don't think I put it up, but he said, "Fear not." I think it was 24 times. Don't be afraid. Fear not. Or take courage. Don't be anxious. Those kind of things. He said that like 25 times. He said that more than don't sin. He said that more than don't judge. He said it more than don't be a hypocrite. I looked them all up. He said it more than don't do any other thing. He said don't fear or don't be afraid. So you got to face that thing. Not fear and turn and you got to face it. He said don't fear don't fear them which can kill the body but they're not able to kill the soul. So you might you know not be able to you know it's nice to have a house. It's certainly wonderful to have a spouse and uh most days no I'm just kidding. It's wonderful to have a spouse. It's wonderful to have a job. It's fantastic to have a you know you know all those things but NOW IF YOU DON'T have those don't worry about it cuz there's one that can kill the soul that you need to be afraid of. Jesus said fear him now. Not just be afraid cuz cuz you know God can't help you but but but you need to have a consecration to God. SO CUZ [screaming] THAT ONE RIGHT THERE IS AFTER YOU. SO so in the in THE IN THE RESPECT OF YOU KNOW FEAR THAT THING SO THAT YOU DON'T TURN TO HIM. JUST KEEP YOUR MIND FOCUSED on God. And he says, "Fear him that's able to bo to both destroy the soul and the body in hell. &gt;&gt; That's the thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, we we have preoccupations about whether or not I can buy a house or a whatever it might be, but but you need to fear the one that could destroy the soul." Brother Banner makes an interesting contrast here in and and in looking up your fear, facing that thing that that would make you worry or that would make you an anxious that would have you in depression. You know, the thing that would have you wondering about tomorrow, Jesus said, ' Don't worry about tomorrow. You know, sufficient for today is the evil thereof. The thing that has you questioning whether you you did the right thing in your past. Many times it's not. We're worried so much about tomorrow. But but we remember what we did in the past and it makes us anxious. Did we make the wrong mistake? Did we make the wrong decision? Did we choose wrong? And and all those past decisions, they begin to to kind of pile up and and and then then they make you anxious about, you know, you made the wrong decision in the past. Now your whole future is is and is is just you know worthless and or you know I'm worried about tomorrow but but let me tell you just focus on the present and don't worry about tomorrow. Don't worry about YOU KNOW THE FUTURE THAT you should worry about is the future of the soul that is placed on the inside of you and you won't get victory over those things until you stop worrying about it. Stop worrying about a past decision. If if you live 48 years you you lived a long long enough life. You made a lot of wrong decisions. Made a wrong decision this morning. I made a wrong one yesterday. Just go through them. But if I focus on all those I made that wrong decision and I made that other one and I made how many wrong decisions do I got to let pile up before depression comes in? &gt;&gt; Don't worry about that. Put that behind you. Repent if you made a mistake and just keep marching forward. Righteous man falls seven times but he rises again. The Bible says okay so he makes a contrast here. Brother Bamab does of the Queen of Sheba and he says that she had to confront what was between her and Solomon. And he would call it back then the Ishelites. You know, he'd say all the Ishelite bands wherever thousand miles away or whatever she was between where she was and where Solomon was was a treacherous journey that she had to confront. Brother, the Bible says this at Matthew 12:42, "The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation of and shall condemn it, for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, a greater than Solomon is here." Now, another thing Brother says, she had all that wealth and the children of Ishmael was on the desert and they were robbers. What a setup. why they'd take that great group of fleefooted riders with their spears and ride on her little caravan there and murder them and have all that wealth to themselves. She had that to confront. Now, you don't have that to confront to come across the street or around the city or from some nearby place. You don't take three months though at a hot through a hot burning desert sitting on the back of a camel. Now, in all sincerity, I wonder tonight how many present would take that journey. But ours is a different journey. Yes, I do. &gt;&gt; It's a journey and it's just as treacherous, by the way. It's very, very treacherous. Her journey was a physical. She got on a camel with her caravan, but in between her there was a there was a lot of things that were that would have made her afraid to get to Solomon. And she had heard things and they were very good and and and what she had HEARD WAS SO GOOD THAT THAT she determined to take the journey. AND AND SO NOW IT'S LIKE THIS THAT THAT WHAT THAT WHAT HAS been presented to you in the way of THE GOSPEL IS SO GOOD. IT [screaming] OUGHT TO MAKE YOU CONFRONT THE FEAR OF THE journey that's before you. IT OUGHT TO GIVE YOU ENOUGH COURAGE &gt;&gt; TO CONFRONT THAT FEAR. CONFACE that thing. Face that anxiety. Face the thing that makes you afraid &gt;&gt; and realize well we'll read what she said in a minute. But realize that the journey is going to be well worth it &gt;&gt; when you get to the end of the road. But I think the song goes when we get to the end of the road. Oh, it'll be it'll be worth it all. Notice what Chronicles 2 Chronicles chapter 9. If we pull that up, she she goes to Solomon and the Bible says she said to the king, it was a true report. Verse 5, which I heard in my own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom. How be it, I believe not their words. I mean, think about it. She didn't even I mean she heard it but like it can't be true but she heard it enough you know she thought it might be worth taking the risk that I would that I would HAVE TO CONFRONT THE FEAR. Imagine if if she was a woman and and she had heard about Ishraelites killing her family her whole life. But you know SHE HAD TO CONFRONT THAT THING. She had to face that anxiety that fear that thing that made HER AFRAID TO TO COME AND BE A WORSHSHIPER of God Almighty. SHE CONFRONTED AND DETERMINED to take the journey. &gt;&gt; And she said, "Until I came and my eyes had seen it. I got to see it for myself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me. She's saying, "Not I I wasn't even told half of it. &gt;&gt; For thou exceed the fame that I heard." Listen, we've heard about heaven. We've heard about a change of body audience and we've heard about a wedding supper. I don't think we've heard a half OF THE GREATNESS OF GOD THAT WE'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE WHEN WE GET to the end of the road. And then now the Bible says she gave the king 120 talents of gold. And oh, I lost my place here. Excuse me. She gave the king 120 talents of gold. I think it's verse nine. And of spices, great abundance and precious stones. Neither was there any such spice as the Queen of Sheba gave King Solomon. You know, when you come here and you don't think it makes a difference maybe, but but if you just sit in the congregation and the music starts playing and and you start singing, you know, you maybe you let out a amen, &gt;&gt; you have no idea how that changes the whole entire uh you know, it might just spirit was just waiting there to enter in and boom, it just entered in. You don't know what that will do if you just offer up something. And Solomon, the Bible says this in verse 12. And King Solomon gave to the Queen of Sheba all her desire. All her desire. Come on now. Whatever you would want, well, all her desire, whatsoever she asked beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned and went away. She and her servants. So, so whatever you desire this morning, now you got to face the thing that's in front of you. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's 2026. SEEMS LIKE YOU NEVER THOUGHT I would be here. I never thought I would be last year. I think I said this. I never thought I'd be here in 25 and 24 and said the same thing over and over and certainly I never thought we'd be here. I I've told this many times in 88, you know, I was 11. I thought, man, it's Billy Paul's getting old. It's got to be coming. Now he's passed on. And now I'm getting old. &gt;&gt; He's still got to be coming. Thank you, brother Joe. He's got one back there. He's also getting old. He's older, by the way, in case you were wondering. Okay. Now, Job is he's forced to confront. He says, "Man born of woman," and this is a true statement. He's of few days and and full of trouble. Oh, it's a I mean, we can all we can all say that, you know, we can all testify. And then he says, "He comes like a flower. He's he's cut down. He flees as a shadow. He doesn't continue. And dust thou open thine eyes upon such and one and bringest me under judgment with thee? Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? &gt;&gt; Not one. His days are determined. The number of his months are with thee. Thou's appointed his bounds. He cannot pass. You know, he's appointed a time and a moment for each of us. &gt;&gt; That time might be tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could be the next day. It could be the next. We don't know it. There is an appointed time though. Might as well just face it. And if you can see, here's the thing. Whatever the thing in your life that's difficult, you know, the test that you have coming up in school or or you know, the boyfriend or girlfriend decision you have to make or the house that you want to buy a financial, whatever it is, whatever that thing, it's not worse than death. Now, if you can face death, look it right in the eye and say, "Death, I got I got something for you that I've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ into my soul. I've accepted THE HOLY SPIRIT. I HAVE THE DOWN PAYMENT OF THE RESURRECTION. And if YOU CAN LOOK DEATH RIGHT IN THE EYE AND FACE HIM, THEN YOU CAN FACE ANY PROBLEM that you've got. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Okay. So now he says, he says, listen, his days are determined. He's got an appointed a boundary. He can't go past it. Turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as in hirling his day. He looks around now. Job does. And he sees a flower. And he sees the flower as it goes through. And October comes and November. and he sees the rain. Brother Benham says it like this that that the that the I think he says the earth has a funeral service for that flower as the fall rains would come and the it would weep and the flower would die and he looks at the tree he says there's hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again. Verse 7 and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. He looks now at the flower and he says flowers got hope. you know, it the spring rains AND THE THE THE HEAVENS CRY WHEN IT DIES. &gt;&gt; And then he says the tree, you know, if if it's CUT DOWN, IT'S GOT HOPE THAT THE TENDER branch thereof will not cease. You know, maybe he sees like an aspen tree gets cut down and but HE SEES A LITTLE CHUTE over there coming BACK UP OR OR maybe from the very root he just sees something rise and he says there's hope of a tree. He says the root where thereof would would wax old in the earth and the stalk thereof die in the ground. And then he says this, "Yet through the scent of water it will bud." &gt;&gt; You ever felt like a spiritual, you know, you need you need a little bit of uplifting? Maybe you felt that this morning like brother Steve did. I I you know, it just was spent after yesterday. So much going on and nothing left. And I came to church and and let me tell you what happened. And I got to church and a few minutes into the service I [snorts] &gt;&gt; I smelled a little water, you know, and I smelled a scent of water and and spiritually it revived my soul and and Job's looking at that tree and he goes, "Man, if that tree just it's, YOU KNOW, WATER THREE MILES away and and that tree can hear it running and there's a scent of water even though it's dead in the earth and the root IS WAXED OLD." HE SAID just a scent of water and all of a sudden it begins to bud again &gt;&gt; and it just gives him a he sees it and he's looking at nature &gt;&gt; and he's like look at THIS NATURE. IT DIES AND THEN IT RISES AGAIN. LOOK AT THE FLOWER AND THE SPRING AND IT'S DEAD AND WE HAD A FUNERAL SERVICE and but but the spring comes and it comes up again &gt;&gt; and he's like let's ALL PRAISE THE LORD FOR THAT. But he's But he's also in a great distress. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's like, "What about what about me?" &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Look at this looking at skin worms in his body. &gt;&gt; He said, "But man dies." He wastes away. Gives up the ghost. Where's he at? We don't see him rise again. I see the tree rise again. I see the flower rise again. I see the bush rise again. You look outside, you see all the cottonwood trees, you know, and all the leaves are off them. They're dying, BUT WE KNOW THAT IN the spring they're going to rise again. You know, LIFE WILL COME BEGIN. AND JOB LOOKS AT ALL THIS and he goes, "But what about me?" &gt;&gt; Look at me and the skin worms and the death of my body. &gt;&gt; He's just in a hopeless in a state of distress. Brother Bam says, "A flower died, it rises again in the spring. If a tree blows down, it comes up again through the scent of water. He seen all botney life living again, but said, "A man layth down. He gives up the ghost. Where's he at? You know, he was an old man. He said, "His sons come over to mourn over him, and he perceived it not. Oh, that thou would hide me in the grave, and keep me in the secret place till thy wrath be passed. Appoint me a time and set me a time." We went on going like that, talking. He was at the end of his distress. What would happen? The leaves live, come back in the tree, the flowers come back and everything else come up. But a man lays down, he gives up the ghost, he was in distress. He didn't know what would happen to him. And him at that age, what a thought. As you as we get old this morning and I look and see some of you over in your 70s and and I'm not there. I feel like I'm saying, but I'm not yet. But you know, I notice that that that I'm getting there. And now as you get old, you begin to look and you you begin to recognize that that man dies. Where what happens to him? And if you're not afra, if you're not careful, a great distress will come upon you. Is there hope for that man? He said, he said, "Now you've been noticing all these things. I'm putting this kindly in a drama child form for the little ones." He said, "Now you've been holding at that, but but remember that flower or that tree never sinned against God. &gt;&gt; Man sinned against God. &gt;&gt; And so it separated him &gt;&gt; from God. That was the difference. that the flower didn't have no sin that it had to, you know, respond to. The tree, it never sinned against God. It was just part of his nature and part of him. And so it dies and but you know, the the life goes down into that root and then spring comes and it lives again and and the life would just be buried in the very soul of that tree. But that tree didn't had no sin. The flower didn't have no sin. &gt;&gt; Job began to wonder why that man laid down and he didn't rise up. He didn't see him come up in the spring, but he seen the flower come up in the spring. &gt;&gt; Well, then when Elahu came to him be to speak to him, he said, "Now look, Job, you're accusing God wrong. Now look, that flower is not sin. It stands right in the way that God made it, and it reproduces itself right back from death to resurrection." Death to resurrection. All right? He said, "Now, but man sinned, and that separated him from God and resurrection. The waters, Job said in verse 11, as the waters fail from the sea and the flood decays and dries up, so man lies down. Verse 12, and rises not till the heavens be no more. They shall not awake, nor be erased out of their sleep. Oh, that thou wouldst hide me in the grave, that thou would thou wouldst keep me secret until thy wrath be passed. That thou wouldstoint me a set time and remember me. If a man die, if sister Vivian or you know laid here in the casket yesterday, if sister Vivian die, brother Fritz die, will he live again? Will that happen? What what are we what what is our thought process of Christianity? What are we here for? What do you even walk through the building for and begin to worship God if eventually we're just going to die and lay in the dust and and that's it? I heard uh I think it was Richard Dawkins. He's some great atheist. if there is such a thing. And they were interviewing. They said, "What do you think happens when you die?" And he's like, "Why just decay and that's it?" What? You have no hope. Job at least looked at the tree and HE SAID, "THE TREE'S GOT HOPE AND I'M MADE IN GOD'S IMAGE. Is there a WAY THAT THAT I CAN HAVE HOPE?" OH, what I would hate to be without hope. What a what a disgusting thing. What a disgusting trick that the devil has given those atheists. And he's a he shamed HIM INTO BELIEVING THAT WHEN YOU JUST DIE, you just die and that all your consciousness is gone and there's nothing left. Well, he's going to realize if he doesn't get converted that HE'S GOING TO DIE, BUT HIS CONSCIOUSNESS will be alive and he'll be suffering in that place of torment until it's cast into the lake of fire and disappears one day. Oh, what a what a terrible thought. Actually, talk about trouble. &gt;&gt; That's trouble. If man die, is he going to live again? See, if you can face this thought, &gt;&gt; if you can fa look death right in the eye, or then Steve, you know, sometimes I've I've had people tell me, "But see, I just wish I could die." Fine. Fine. Maybe death is is not as bad for you. Whatever your anxiety is, your depression, the thing that that that kind of holds you, you know what it holds you from? It holds you from joy. I titled this sermon, I don't think I pulled it up, the joy that you missed. That's actually what it holds you from. All that anxiety and the depression and the things in your life that you're fearful about, you need to turn and look him right in the eye. Take God with you when you do that turn. By the way, don't try to look it by, you know, by yourself, BUT TAKE GOD AT YOUR SIDE AND SAY, "LORD, HELP ME AS I FACE this thing that's that I've been confronting all my life WITHOUT YOU." TURN AND FACE IT. LOOK IT RIGHT in the eye. And the THING THAT YOU GREATLY FEAR, face it with God ALMIGHTY CUZ HE'S MORE THAN able to help you overcome that thing. Eliu, brother Am says, when Eliu began to get him straightened out, he be to see that there was coming one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, Eliu came to him. He said like this. Now Job, I put it so the children understand. Now Job, you're watching that flower and that tree. That flower tree never did sin, but man sin. See the tree just and grain and stuff just perpetually comes. But man sinned and that cut off his relationship between him and God. There's no resurrection for him now. But oh, I love it. But there's a coming one, a just one who will stand in the breach. Put a hand on sinful man and holy God and bridge the way for there will come the resurrection. SO ELI COMES TO JOB AND AND HE BRINGS SOMETHING TO Job that maybe hadn't thought about, but he did think about it because he testifies in verse 19 THAT THERE'S COMING ONE cuz you need somebody &gt;&gt; TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN DEATH and life. You know, to to BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN GOD AND MAN in man, not just man, but man in the sinful state in which he was born. Born in sin and shaped in iniquity. Who's going to bridge the gap? Who can take us there? And Eli who says, "Listen, there is coming one." &gt;&gt; And that's the problem is we don't turn and face our fears with God who's able to bridge the gap between you and your anxiety. And he's ABLE TO OVERCOME YOU AND YOUR DEPRESSION, YOU AND YOUR LACK OF A JOB, YOU AND YOUR LACK OF ECONOMY. GOD [screaming] IS ABLE TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN YOU AND THAT THING, whatever it would be. You got to you got to just cut close to him this morning. &gt;&gt; Put him first in your life. &gt;&gt; Have pity chapter 19 verse 21 as we move forward. There's a few more things here. Have pity on me. Have pity on me. And he's talking to his friends. &gt;&gt; And by the way, when he makes this statement, well, we'll just we'll just say it here. Oh ye my friends, for the hand of God has touched me. Why do you persecute me as God and are not satisfied with my flesh? Oh, that my words were now written. Oh, that they were printed in a book. Oh, that they were graven with an iron pen and led in the rock forever. For I know that my redeemer lives. This is the greatest statement right here that God that Job got a just a vision. Brother Bam said the lightning flash and the thunder roared and Job GOT A VISION OF SOMEBODY THAT COULD BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN SINFUL MAN AND A HOLY GOD. AND HE SAID THAT'S THE THING CALLED THE redeemer and he'll stand at the latter day upon the earth. And that before that he said, "Hey, THE TREE HAS NO HOPE. THE TREE HAS HOPE. THE THE FLOWER has hope. But what about man?" AND WHEN HE SAW THE REDEEMER BRIDGING THE GAP, HE SAID, "PRAISE GOD, I've got hope, too." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice, &gt;&gt; he'll stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though, and I know how King James translated this, it's very interesting. after my skin worms. I've always thought it was skin worms. King James says, "My skin worms like they're, you know, Brother Bam said they're like they're there already." &gt;&gt; You know, you could try to a nurse back there could probably tell you, you know, you could try to clean yourself and get all this soap and you know, I've seen them go into operating rooms. They can't help it. They they clean and clean and scrape and scrub and wash and make you wash and shave. I mean, there's nothing. and and yet somehow bacteria sneaks in. You know, it's like they're already even after doing all that, they give you antibiotics cuz you know they can't help everything. It's cuz Job is looking though. He's sitting there on the ash sheep and looking at like actual skin worms. Though they destroy my body, this body, &gt;&gt; he's looking, he's like, this body, this, right? Though these skin worms will destroy this, yet on my flesh. &gt;&gt; Now, how could that be? They destroy the body, but in the body, in the flesh, I'll see God. How could that be? Yesterday they decided to not to be doctrinally a doctrinal point here but they decided to cremate the sister and and then they brought the casted forth but they had it closed and nobody knew and and then they asked me what about cremation is that okay and not to be a doctrinal point or anything but here's the fact of the matter that just within a few years of you being buried just starts everything just is decaying &gt;&gt; everything then brother Ram said the nose caves in first and you've seen that just you know if you're in Egypt and you would try to preserve serve it as good as you could. I don't think God is going to go over if you've had been in dead, you know, for like four years and it's not super decayed, he's going to go, "Well, I can still use a little bit of those bones and kind of patch it up." Like, I don't think that. But I think there's actually like a different body, but it's the same body, don't get me wrong, BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S THE BODY THAT YOU HAVE IN PERFECTION. Brother Brandham explains it like this, that when you go, you pick up a theophony. You pick up a theophony and you go to that paradise and you wait and you wait and you wait and then he says you come back down AND YOU PICK UP that earth's body and he calls that a glorified body. He says it like this. I don't care where all the CELLS ARE AND WHERE all the atoms are and where all the molecules are. God knows where every one of them is and HE'S ABLE TO BRING THEM ALL BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND MAKE THAT GLORIFIED BODY LIVE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Job says my body, he says, listen worms, you destroy ALL YOU WANT. GOD KNOWS WHERE THAT MOLECULE is and that molecule is and that cell IS AND HE'LL UNITE THEM ALL IN A GLORIFIED BODY ONE day and it'll just be a perfect like when you were you know 20 like when I had more hair you know thank you brother Rolando and brother Rolando had black hair you see that that body you know God knows where all those cells are he knows where every molecule is and he he takes takes you into like a theophony. He says that's been formed. He said Jesus and this might be a little deep, but just bear with me. He says Melzdc. He said God came down. He just picked up some dust and he stepped into he said Melzdc was God. Did you know that? But but he said he was in his theophony form. And he said you bypassed your theophony and you came from from God and went right to be tempted in the flesh. But then he says you're going back TO THE THEOPHONY AND YOU'LL BE IN THAT theophony state until the resurrection happens. You'll come down to earth. You're picking up the perfection that God made you in. And you'll be in a glorified state. &gt;&gt; Oh, destroy my flesh in my flesh. &gt;&gt; I will see God. We are waiting for the fullness of adoption. This will take place when &gt;&gt; at the first resurrection. That's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we are and will have a body like his own glorious body. For we shall see him as he is and will be like him. When he appears, we appear and his likeness will have a body like his. A glorious, glorified body. And all the trials and struggles of life will fade off into a little mist and blown away to be no more. &gt;&gt; Never be no more. &gt;&gt; We meet Jesus in the air before we get home. I don't think we ever spoke on this before, but just let's see what he says here. That's right. This second Thessalonians tells us that for we meet him in the air. beautiful type of Rebecca meeting Isaac in the field in the cool of the day. We meet him in the air. Second, it's I think it's first Thessalonians, but he tells us, "So, for we we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep, for the trumpet of God shall sound, the dead in Christ shall rise first. We which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air." Brother Bam says, "Therefore, the theophony, if you have died and entered into that theophony, what happens? The theophony comes to the earth to pick up the redeemed body. And if you're here in the air, you take the body to meet the theophony. There you are and caught up and go meet the Lord in the air. Isn't that beautiful? IF YOU'RE HERE, guess what? You're going up to meet there. But either way, IT'S JUST A GLORIFIED THING THAT God is going to and if your loved ones HAVE GONE ON, THEY'RE there waiting and they're COMING DOWN TO PERFECT AND THEY'RE GOING TO KNOCK ON SOME DOORS ONE day and they're going to meet us saints and it's going to be in the air, but it's going to be in a dimension we won't even understand. Praise God. Now, there's coming one someday who will stand in the breach between a sinful manise &gt;&gt; and a holy God and bridge the way. Put a hand on a sinful man and the holy God bridge the way. Speaking of Christ, the prophet saw it. He stood on his feet. The lightnings begin to flash. The thunders roared. Jobs said, Job said, "I know my redeemer liveth. And at the last days, he'll stand on the earth. Though the stemmed destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself. He says, "And mine eyes shall behold and not another, though my reigns be consumed within me." &gt;&gt; You're going to see him, saints. &gt;&gt; Now listen now, just we'll just close with this this one quote. I just want you to grab on for a second. What if you don't face the fear and overcome that thing? And you understand what I mean by that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And overcome that thing because if you you'd run from it, God's going to he's going to make you face the thing because he's he wants you to know really. He wants you to know that greater is he that IS IN YOU THAT CAN OVERCOME ANY FEAR YOU HAVE. &gt;&gt; So he doesn't want you to run from it or to try to face it all by yourself. Because if you do that, you'll be end up like Job trying to face it. BUT YOU GOT TO FACE IT WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; You must face it. But you must not. If you try to face it by yourself, you'll fall. &gt;&gt; You'll fail. It'll destroy you. You'll blame the message. You'll blame Christ. You'll blame your brother. Don't try to face it. There there might be some fear that you're afraid of with what you believe. You just don't understand. And so, Satan's tried to put a fear on you. Take God with you. pray about that thing and face that thing with him. And he'll provide you the revelation that you need to overcome that fear. &gt;&gt; And if you don't do that, you're missing out on something. &gt;&gt; If you're fearful your whole life, &gt;&gt; that's correct. &gt;&gt; You're missing out on something. &gt;&gt; Do you want to miss out? I don't want to miss out on something. We're going to close with this quote, but I I I want it to stick for a second. Musicians could come. Jesus, he says, "Then be ye therefore perfect, even as your heavenly father is perfect." How can you be? &gt;&gt; How can you be perfect when it's not my perfection? &gt;&gt; Well, that's kind of the key right there, isn't it? Do we have that up there? I I might have forgot that one. It should be the last quote. How can you be when it's not my perfection? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just trust me on this one. Do I I don't have that up there. Sister Pauline, find that for me. I want I want them to read it along. It's Lamb's Book of Life, 63 of 56. I want you to read this along. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Forgive me for missing it. It's uh I don't know what paragraph it starts with. Then be therefore perfect. Praise the Lord. Then be you therefore I think it's look up perfection. Well, I might just play it for you. Thank the Lord for technology there. I think that's it. Okay. Yes, that's it. I think that's it. Scroll down just a second. Scroll down a little bit. Little more. A little more. Yep. Yep. That's it. All right. Just How about we just play that? You can hear him say it so I don't have to say it. How's that? Start with that 165. Got that right, brother Tim? &gt;&gt; Be therefore even Your heavenly father IS PERFECT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU BE WHEN IT'S NOT MY PERFECTION? It's not your perfection. IT'S HIS PERFECTION OF HIS WORD THAT HE CHOSE YOU AND YOU NEVER CHOSE HIM AND HE BROUGHT YOU INTO CHRIST AND YOU'RE SECURE WITH JESUS CHRIST. AND JUST AS PERFECT AS LIFE WAS BEFORE GOD FOR YOU'RE not standing with your own, you're standing in him with a paragraph. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, I love you. Oh my. ALL ON THE OTHER SIDE of Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful time it'll be someday. &gt;&gt; When you look back down and say, "Why did I fear? Look at the joy I missed." Young man, young woman, &gt;&gt; was that for a second there. Why did I fear? &gt;&gt; Look at the joy I missed. That's what it does when you're afraid death, whatever it might be in your life. You anxious about some future decision you're going to make or some past failure that you you think it was a failure. It might not be. God might have just been using it for everything. So, you get anxious about that. You be fearful about that or worried or depressed, whatever it might be. Or in the future, you got something. Play that again. Why did I fear? Look at the joy I missed. &gt;&gt; I don't want to miss it. Why did I fear her? Look at the joy I miss. &gt;&gt; Don't keep playing. Just Just one more paragraph. &gt;&gt; Young man, young woman this morning. Are you old man or woman who's never been a Christian? God's continually knocked at your heart. [clears throat] Oh yes. You might come in at the end of the road, but you'll have no joy. There'll be no STAR AROUND YOU TO SHINE. I don't want to stand LIKE THAT. I WANT TO HEAR HIM SAY, "IT WAS WELL DONE, my good and faithful." I want to show him my appreciation. &gt;&gt; My poor little grayheaded wife. HOW I'D LOVE TO DO SOMETHING for her, but I know she likes &gt;&gt; because I love her and I know she loves me. And if I do that for my wife and the human love, what ought I have to do to know that God by grace before the foundation world seen me a poor little sinner staggered and was going TO HELL AND COULDN'T HAVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And he forame me and put my name in the lamb's book of life the foundation world. OH, I LOVE HIM. THERE'S NO WAY I WILL EVER TELL HIM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NO WONDER THE BIBLE SAID eyes not seen ears not heard. NEITHER HAS ENTERED INTO THE HEARTS OF MAN. Poor man. &gt;&gt; How glorious God is. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Don't you want to trust him? &gt;&gt; If you're weary and crossing out, &gt;&gt; SHAME ON YOU CHRISTIANS THAT call yourselves Christians. &gt;&gt; And glory. Well, I don't know. If I go to church, say, "Oh, you're a poor excuse. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, lift up your head. STRAIGHTEN UP YOUR CHEST. [screaming] &gt;&gt; OH, USE FAITH." &gt;&gt; AMEN. FAITH IS A BOSS. &gt;&gt; Faith has HAIRS ON ITS CHEST. IT'S GOT BIG [screaming] MUSCLES. &gt;&gt; WHEN SPEAK FROM ONE side the other &gt;&gt; the devil said, "Now you just can't make it. You can't do this. YOU'RE ASHAMED TO TESTIFY." FAITH RAISED UP SAY, "AMEN." &gt;&gt; SURE. &gt;&gt; Faith takes the initiative. &gt;&gt; That's what we need today. Pray for the children IN THE LAND. STRAIGHTEN UP YOUR HEAD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD. PRAISE THE LORD. Brother Isaac, let's sing that. Stand with us this morning. I like what he said. Straighten up. &gt;&gt; Don't I don't want to get up there and say, "Look at all the joy I missed." &gt;&gt; Man, you can have joy this morning. Even if you got trials that are facing you and this and that, why don't you face them? And &gt;&gt; I don't want to be missing out on any joy. Personally, I've already missed out enough joy in life. I'd like to have go forward with a a lot of joy. Praise the Lord. Help us out, brother Isaac. &gt;&gt; I get joy when I think about what he's done for me.

And may it start, Lord, with [music] prayer. May it start with reading the Bible. But more important, may it start with us rededicating ourselves to you first and then reading the Bible. Reconsecrating ourselves and then praying. for truly our soul is the [music] prize. And then may we go out and finish [music] what you have purposed our lives for. [snorts] We will give you all the glory. We will give you all the honor. Your presence this morning has made the difference.
