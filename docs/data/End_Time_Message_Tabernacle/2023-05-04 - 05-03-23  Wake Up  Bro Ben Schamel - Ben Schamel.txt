happy to be in church [Applause] it's a bonus day today we got our Sunday in already and now we've got Wednesday [Music] yeah these scriptures will go ahead and jump right into the word this evening we'll try not to be long tonight I know everybody is tired from the week and we're just happy to be with you again on a Wednesday you would turn over we'll read a familiar scripture Matthew 25. we'll read verses one through ten we'll see and then we'll flip over to first Thessalonians 4 13. and we'll read 13 through 16. okay says the Bible reads like this in Matthew says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened to ten likened and attend virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom this is five of them are wise and five were foolish is they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps lump and the foolish she said into the wise give us of your oil for our lamps have gone out but the wise answered saying not so less rather last there be not enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went with him into the marriage and the door was shut up and then we'll flip over to first Thessalonians chapter four and verse 13 verses and Paul says to the Thessalonians he says but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring forth with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain into the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first Calise and let's just bow our heads dear gracious Heavenly Father Celeste Lord we just come before you yet once more Lord we're thankful for another opportunity to read your scriptures learning to have the revelation of this message Lord a prophet that came and made these things clear to us we're just so thankful for that we just ask that you would be with us this evening Lord please help me to get myself out of the way Lord that I might be able to get into the channel of the Holy Spirit wherever you want me to go Lord just lead me there you know the needs amongst the people this evening Lord I don't know what their need is Lord we've come to church not out of church foreign so if I could take from these scriptures a simple thought I don't understand and I can title it just wake up amen amen we know that we're tired sometimes I know for me when it's midnight I just want to sleep I sure like my sleep you work hard throughout the day and night comes you want to sleep but the point of tonight is don't be a heavy sleeper but if we could take what the scripture says in Thessalonians it says that the Lord shall descend with three things and we've recently I know you've recently gone through a lot of this with your pastor um because these things are talked about in the seals in great depths but the scripture says the Lord himself shall descend with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and we know that the uh shout is a message and we believe that that message has come there's many voices that we can listen to out in the world we talked about some of that on Sundays but there will become a shout first so what message are we listening to How do you know that the message is right but the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout and then with the voice of the archangels and then with the Trump of God I got to thinking about this story of the the ten virgins and I began to wonder why is it important that they trim the lamps because we know today we just walk into a room we just flip the switch [Music] and there is light or there's Panic if you flip the switch and there's no light oh no what's going on but back in the day there was uh oil lamps and there's a wick that would go down into the vessel and it withdraw that's right without oil it's hard to get that lamp lit so um without the Holy Ghost in Church Charlotte sometimes it can be difficult to feel the fire of God if you're coming to church out of tradition then it seems like labor coming to church out of tradition then it can be hard to stay in awaken Church you have to put forth a lot of effort the services they seem really long but if you can ever get hold of that Holy Spirit it'll change your life that light won't be Smoky anymore but it'll become clearer you won't be walking in darkness but you'll be able to see where you're walking you will have revelation then it won't be confusing to read your Bible but through the Holy Ghost and this message you are entitled to understand what the scriptures are saying amen praise the Lord this message has brought a light to us it's a restoration of the holy spirit's life we know that the Holy Spirit light was with Moses the pillar of fire was with Moses and where the pillar of fire is great things happen yes sir with that Pillar of Fire leading the Israelites there was no sea that could stand in their way that light was with Joshua it would lead and guide them it didn't matter how big the Jericho walls were yeah but there is great power where that light is it doesn't matter your situation but if there's no Holy Ghost there to draw from I know then you're counting on your works you must have the Holy Ghost to draw from but it's very important that they trimmed their lamps because after a a lamp had burned there would be a dark uh soot on the wicked and it makes it very difficult to re-light the witch all of that it just gets in the way and if you could get that lamp lit it would be very smoky and it would either do one of two things it would either be so Smoky that the light would be very dim or it would burn so hot that it would be out of control so we see in a story that a messenger comes and he says get ready trim your lamps because when you trim your lamp then that light can shine to its brightest potential [Music] it can be a very clear light so you could see all that was in the room and that soot is just like our worldly things that we so often cling on the shoes I was listening to a message brother Brandon preached spiritual Amnesia and he was just preaching on how so many Christians get spiritual Amnesia yeah Amnesia we know who we are we know we are the brightest dishes we know Malachi foreign but I can find inspiration preaching to myself because I have found myself sitting in a message Pew I see it's growing up in the message knowing all the right things to say knowing all the phrases [Music] from the outside you would think I'm a good message believer but if we're not careful we get spiritual Amnesia and we forget the power that comes along with the message we forget the Holy Ghost Fire he comes alive we focus so much on the mechanics that we forget about the Dynamics you can have a Ferrari is to lead and guide you through the Darkest Days that's ever existed and get you from 0.1 from this world to samonda to the Rapture and that's what we're looking for tonight so we see these these virgins are asleep brother random says that they were all virgins they were all Christians they were all message Believers and as they tarried they were waiting for the Rapture and they took their lamps which is their Works brother Brandon said [Music] and five of them took no oil and brother Branham tells us that the oil is the Holy Ghost just that story alone if brother Branham could just reveal that one story to us how great the message would be let alone all the Mysteries that are contained in the scriptures all of them have been revealed but sometimes we find it's hard to to study it's hard to read our Bibles and prayers I'm asking you Church what is missing we know we're getting close to the Raptors so what is missing where's the urgency if we have the Holy Spirit fire burning inside of us then we're going to want everyone else to have the same oil never be ashamed of this message there's people in the denominations reading these scriptures but we can see that it is a book of Revelation and not a book of mysteries if the Methodist could see that boy they'd be shouting required amen that light amen has been missing for hundreds of years hundreds and hundreds of years and this age don't say tired what a blessed people we are if we could just grasp that I'm living in the Holy Ghost age we look at Jesus Christ brother Branham was when God and man came together Jesus Christ was the merging of humanity and divinity you know where I'm going um human and then up in the upper room the same thing happened because at the crucifixion that veil was renting too but crucifixion said that there was a badger skin Veil that the presence and he says in this day there's another fleshly Veil that's the presence of God is hiding behind and it's not brother Branham only but it is God's people God is hiding behind a fleshly veil and he said a project to tell you that it's you wow well that just makes me happy you can't hear preaching like that in the denominations they don't have this message makes me want to go out and preach on the side of the street if people could only see this that God and man are becoming one this is the hour [Applause] stay on track Matthew 25 my children sing verse six you'll see she's and it says at midnight and we already know brother Brandon had preached Two Minutes to Midnight it was that 60 years ago now foreign many of us have seen this little diagram of the seven Church ages right brother this church age it's gonna be the shortest Church age if you do the math which I know brother probably has done foreign guess what year that is 2023 could it be this year I'm not going to pretend like I know everything I'm not gonna pretend like I have some great Revelation but I can tell you one thing get up wake up church [Applause] and it could be this year it could be tomorrow it could be tonight I don't know but I know he's coming that's how close we could be there's no more Mysteries left to reveal all the scriptures have been fulfilled complete we're ready for a rapture and at midnight there was a cry made that's the shout a messenger came with a shot behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him and we flip over to first Thessalonians says the Lord shall descend with from heaven with a shout the next thing is with the voice and brother Branham said that is the same voice that raised Lazarus from the dead that's going to be the Resurrection the literal voice of Jesus Christ we'll call the Dead from the grave it's a Lazarus hallelujah we're that close this is so there's some quotes that I want to read here let me find it I think it was voice of the sign 64. paragraph 80 92 I think it was let's start with 120. no more bounce backwards says every time before it happening now we bypass two or three pages here he's skipping notes you see a few minutes of different profits just to show you that you understand before anything happens God comes with a prophet to vindicate his word hallelujah and that coming of a prophet is a sign so every time before something happens there is always going to be a sign you now let's jump back to paragraph 89. I had some notes with these TC let's start with 82. but in the Old Testament they were more than that they were seers they were a man who told what was coming to pass and it happened that gave him the rights to be The Interpreter of the word of God because God took the word of that day and interpreted it himself through that man yeah and interpreted it himself through that man all right so we're not following any man we are following Jesus Christ and he sent us a messenger before he came to give us an opportunity to get ourselves ready the church world is lost they don't know when he's coming but a messenger has come to say get ready that's what he came on Earth he's always a sign [Music] when a prophet comes to the Earth just watch as we go through it and see if it isn't so much always sends his prophet and you see a prophet rise on this on the scene let me reread he says when you see a prophet rise on the scene look out yes sir so we are following a true word message because that message has sounded that shout has gone foreign is it found in the scripture [Music] he would prophesy and it would come to pass he would have healing after healing after healing yeah is not to vindicate the man himself remember but the message that is going along with him just to keep some balance I was listening to a message I think it's in the token where brother Branham said that his ministry was greater than Jesus Christ's own Ministry he said Jeffersonville Indiana has seen more miracles imagine the magnitude of this message is coming down to vindicate this message more than he said to Jesus Christ in Nazareth please that's all the kids would say successful I read that that paragraph it blew my mind and then you can't say that God doesn't love his right he's Vindicated and Vindicated and over Vindicated say catch your attention he didn't descend with a whisper yeah but he descended with a shout because he wants to get our attention praise the Lord are we good so far I have a timer on myself don't worry but the purpose of this messenger was to go wake up the sleeping Brides she was resting dormant so the bride was always there but she wasn't awakened yet we were always here but we didn't always see the message I don't care if you were born and raised in a message I didn't understand the message growing up in the message but when it's revealed to you when this world awakens you on the inside then it does something to you praise the Lord back to the paragraph where were we 82 news look out now paragraph 95. paragraphsenko let's back up to 94. says the pillar of fire as soon as the sign came up there it was the was the sign that the voice was ready to speak amen amen so the sign and the shout are the same electricity so the sign that God sent us it was a messenger with a message and it's saying that the voice is ready to speak hello how many beliefs that say Amen then the voice is ready to speak the voice is ready to speak because we see the sign language the pillar of fire was there to say that the voice was ready to speak amen to restore something means to bring back to its original states that's right so there's some people that will never see this message but there are some of us where our names were written back in the book way before the foundation of the world and because our names are there then we can be restored back to what we originally worked a Salvation message right here amen this is a twenty dollar bill it's got a value of twenty dollars now I got everybody's attention right it doesn't matter if this is but what if I just some of your s can't imagine I'm doing this brother Patrick do you want this one it hasn't lost its value right this is what it really is at least he gets something out of church right and he'll never forget this message because he got paid to be in church why he received something from the message if we could only receive something from this message I guarantee you it's worth every bit more than that twenty dollars and what you can receive from this message is worth more than whatever if you can only wake yourself up get yourself ready because we're going in a rap we don't have to be bound down we can see that we still have values that's who we really are we still have values I'm telling you the store doesn't care where that dollar bill has been they'll still accept it as the twenty dollars did I crumple it up did I marry it did I stomp on it sometimes we let the devil do that to us we get ourselves all in a tight wad we don't know what's going on we let him just trample all over us and we let Satan tell us that we're no longer a 20 billion when in reality we have not lost an ounce of purchasing power when we were in God's mind when he said let there be lights I'll tell you what kind of God we serve he didn't say let there be light and there wasn't light yeah [Applause] and now is the time when God and man are becoming one [Applause] I don't care what you're going through but it's time to wake up church it's time to realize we're about ready to go to a marriage supper during the day that wasn't on their mind anymore maybe they had a long Voyage [Music] maybe they had to walk Barefoot all the way down maybe they were exhausted maybe they felt very fatigued but I tell you what when they heard that voice it's time to trim your legs I guarantee they were excited there was a fire not only burning in her lamp because they knew they were going to land they were a participants they're not just going as a viewer an honor guest the VIP praise the Lord brother Brandon says in the message the rapture he says the first thing comes this is paragraph 141. and this is the rapture in December 4th this song now remember those those those quotes I just read to you they were preached about a year and a half so after the seals were broken and brother Branham is telling us that we're looking for a sign [Music] a prophet and prophet because the voice is about ready to speak he says when he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout he said what is it it's a message to gather the people together when you look at the ministry of brother Branham he could have been a very rich and wealthy man he was offered a million dollars cash back in those days I think that would translate to maybe 5 million 10 million now it's doubled in the last two years whatever it was how many preachers would fall for that how many message preachers would fall for them it was coming from a Christian man foreign it wasn't some worldly man offering it to him but we can't we don't have time to get our eyes on to these worldly things okay what is it it's a message to gather the people together a message comes forth first now lamp trimming time rise and trim your land what watch was that yes sir the seventh yeah the types in here some of them found out they didn't have any oil in their life don't let that be you yes now is the time to prepare now is the time to get yourself ready if you're not dressing right now is the time to correct it if you're not talking right now is the time if you don't have the Holy Spirit now is the time to correct it amen so many times we just make up the Holy Spirit as like a lottery please like some people get it some people don't accept the sweet daughter no you come up to the Altar and some people get touched and some people don't juvenile I can tell you this is some people will come up to the altar some people will receive emotions and some people won't that has nothing to do with being touched by God or not so many times we think that we have to be touched by emotions or some great lightning bolt has to come down to feel like we've been touched by God but have you ever heard of the still small voice sometimes it's that still small voice when God comes to you and God says you're forgiven I love you all those old things are pastors it doesn't have to come through a loud shouting and jumping up yeah although there is stimulation of Revelation I believe in that too here's what I believe you praise God the way you want to praise God don't worry about what brother Patrick thinks if you want to just raise up and say praise God hallelujah [Applause] if you're reserved and you just say praise God hallelujah that's just fine too there's no big eyes little use right or wrong it's how you relate to Christ it is your personal walk with Christ I want to get to something here before we do okay and they did yeah some of them found out they didn't even have any oil in their lamps I like what brother random says here he says but it's lamp trimming time he says it's Malachi four times it's Luke 17. Hallelujah we know that it was already Malachi three times and look what it produced now it's Malachi and look at what it's producing it's producing you and becoming one what's up thank you remember amen it's Malachi four times it's Luke 17 30 times just like John 4 ran the first coming of Christ so brother branham's Ministries we don't have to make it all mysterious to say the seventh angel anymore we know his name is this message that we follow the Vindicated word [Applause] amen this message wasn't four times this message is for now [Applause] let's imagine we're in a great Symphony a grand Orchestra as brother Brandon would say and the director is telling them how to go along the song and they're following the music notes page after page perfectly in Harmony and then you get to the seventh page and the trumpet wants to go back to the first it wouldn't be in harmony something would be wrong when it comes time for the seventh page you must stay with the seventh page Batman the shout must be by a prophet young people don't ever be ashamed of this message or what it produces I don't care if you go to a public schools [Music] I was homeschooled so I didn't have to deal with a lot of that um but when you go to school and people say boy you're old-fashioned they don't even know what that means but I can guarantee you one thing if you look at them and see what their life produces and then look at their life and see if that's what you want [Music] all these guys can get all these girls can you imagine trying to date in the world today with all this transgender and gay and all this stuff going on just being real yeah you date somebody for months and then you find out they're not even the same gender as what you thought think about it and then we wonder why our parents are so protective of it am I right or am I right this message is here to prepare us for something greater [Music] God is protecting you from heartbreaking when you go into school looking pure and holy you are a billboard for Jesus Christ who would you rather represented just do it Nike Nike Pumbaa Puma Puma you name it who would you rather representation our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ or some fashionable name brand whose quality is no better it just has a logo and it costs a lot more oh my that's right that's right it doesn't matter what shoes you wear remember but it matters who's under your feet listen the Bride of Jesus Christ Satan is supposed to be under her feet down by the foundations and then all the girls are wanting to put on makeup what are they what do they call that Foundation right you're putting the devil's foundation on your face guess where his kingdom goes on top of the foundation that was free but we're living in Malachi for five times and what was his cry straighten up get back in line and then he goes right into correcting the women where they're at and then he turns on us brothers and says it's because you won't take the position in your home and then he puts on an apron it starts washing the dishes like I said I'm just preaching it myself all right my family moved out on me my family instead of me turning 18 and moving out on my family said man this guy's getting so old and he's never moving out I'm moving out taking the whole family with me so I get to wash all my own dishes but sometimes being a real man isn't just being the dominating man why if you do this wife you take care of the children well if you take care of the dishes the wife you clean the house and then you go hand her the checkbook and make her balance it is and you kick back in the Lazy Boy foreign [Music] it's saying sorry to those that you've heard it's saying sorry to those that you've heard if if a man wants to be a real man let him say apologize to those he's hurt oh okay then we'll see how many real men there are yeah if you make a mistake you must be humble and corrected okay my time's about up finial okay let's switch over to Revelations 10 and we'll close with this I don't know Revelation 10. and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow and brother Branham tells us that is Christ and he had on in his hand a little book open [Music] you see to many people many Christians the book is closed to them it has not been revealed to them but brother Branham came and preached just the Mighty God unveiled just like there was an unveiling at Christ's time there is an unveiling in this last hour and that's the message that we believe that's why we gather ourselves together we're not just showing up to show face because people think we're not a message believer if we don't show up no but we're showing up because we have a message we have a revelated word message and we're coming to become closer to God and get more of that Revelation that he's trying to give us because it's an open book it's not a closed book but our names are written on that book and just like John did I can imagine when he saw his name he shouted where Heaven could hear it's where everybody on Earth his shout It's All Out the Devil could hear people because he was just happy that his name was on the board [Applause] what did Jesus say he told his disciples don't be happy that you can do all these Miracles Miracles are such a grand thing to us a lot of preacher comes through and have a prayer line and he heals get the people get healed under his ministries oh he's just such a great man of God come this year Jesus said don't get caught up in those things but be happy that your names are on the books I'm just happy my name is on the bus well how do you know your name's can you read your name on the bus I know my name is because I am manifesting the evidence [Applause] brother Patrick you manifest it that your name is [Applause] a wheat plant is going to produce wheat how do you know it's weak because it produces wheat how do you know a sheep is cheap [Music] it doesn't go into a factory and fabricate all the yarn but it just goes about life handling the struggles of life and it produces something that is absolutely totally different then what the goats produce the goats eat the same thing but they don't produce wall they produce hair but a sheep Bears wolf amen [Music] that's right how do you know you have the Holy Spirit because you will manifested Hallelujah it's an open books oh I got distracted Revelations 10. can you set this right uh right foot upon the sea and left here let's skip it skip down verse 7 verses Revelations 10 and 7. this is it but in the days of the voice of the seventh angels many people look and read at these scriptures and wonder they don't know if this is in times paste they don't know if it's in time future we had a prophet to say this is now in the days of the voice of the seventh Angels maybe I'll read it like this in the days of brother William Brown is his name in there then how do you know it's him because he manifests his name was in the book let me read it again in the year 2023 the um listening to brother Brown's message when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants and the voice so we've already seen Christ now we've seen brother Branham and John is a type of the Bride he says and the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angels I'll behave which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth so are we taking the book out of brother branham's hand no no we're taking the book no Christ we're not falling in love with Eliezer we're falling in love with Isaac all right not some Pastor over in Africa I don't care if he's got 80 000. person what God is doing right now he said go and take the little book that is [Music] verse nine that's enough and I went unto the angel and I said unto him give me of the living song give it to me every time there's a church service give it to me like brother Brandon said every time those doors open up give it to me whatever promise God has in this scripture give it to me if it promises healing give it to me if it promises Deliverance whatever I have need of us I go to the little book and I don't just set it on the shelf for later let's go to the book you take the book and you eat it up it'll create stimulation of Revelation and it shall make thy belly bitter um foreign that's people turning against Jesus we're not in a popularity contest do you think brother foston would preach some of the things he preaches if he was just worried about being popular I'll tell you one thing you guys are blessed people to have a pastor that will toe that line and we'll tow it as straight as he preaches cause you just can't go to the Baptist Church and hear that kind of preaching English it's not a popularity contest but it is the word of God praise the Lord if the musicians want to go ahead and come on but we could just look around and see where we're at brother Brandon gave the example of Psalms 22 I believe it was where the Pharisees were singing down at the temple and they're singing a song saying and they pierced my side while the scripture was coming to pass that's what's happening down there in the temple at the same exact time upon the hills Jesus Christ is dying on the cross those people totally missed you and it's time to wake up don't miss what God is doing today it's time to wake up emotionally because even the world is fulfilling their scriptures so I believe if they're fulfilling their scriptures how much more the Bride of Jesus is going to fulfill prescription [Music] so it's time to wake up disability trim our lamps get all those worldly things shaking off young people just came back from Louisiana campus it's easy to shake things off you know Monday Tuesday Wednesday after campaign [Music] the emotion wears off there's got to be something there has to be oil that you can drop if you got saved at Louisiana that's not the end of the road that's just the beginning and these signs shall follow them that means you're going to have tribes you're gonna have tribulations because Satan doesn't like that you got saved at the Museum he can train all those guns on somebody that'll be us but those two spirits will be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible we must make sure just stand [Music] his name man's heart is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the gracious Heavenly Father Lord with Humble Hearts this evening but every time we look at this message Lord there's no way to express in our hearts how thankful we are Saving Grace Lord your message of warning and preparation help us to wake up help us to get ready don't let Satan distract us
