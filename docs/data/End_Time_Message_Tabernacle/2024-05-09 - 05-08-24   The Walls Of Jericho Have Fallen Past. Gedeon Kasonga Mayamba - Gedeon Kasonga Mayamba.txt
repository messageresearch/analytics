Fellowship among you and the great uh Brotherhood and fellowship that the pastor has shown to us now we feel like coming back again for the another opportunity can we bring your your greetings to where we going to go one time in the Bible the children were going to the Lord Jesus Christ and the disciple wanted to kick them out and Jesus said hinder not the children to come to me because the kingdom is like them but there are adult but they look like children and Malachi promised at the end time to bring back the hearts of the children I would like tonight let us be relaxed in the atmosphere of the children tonight if you keep your standard you miss it I want us to behave like children amen amen my text is the walls of Jericho Has Fallen I'm not saying that the walls of Jericho will fall I'm saying they are already been Fallen I came tonight with profound conviction every walls that has been standing for a while before you I'm not saying that they will fall in the future but they already been Fallen we are just coming to notice the the the chaos that is why we we should stand I'm taking Joshua chapter 6 let us stand verse 15 to verse 16 and I'm jumping to verse 20 our reading in the name of the Lord [Music] Jesus and it came to pass on the seventh day that they Rose early about the daing of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times only on that day they Compass the city seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priest blew with the trumpet Joshua said unto the people shout for the Lord has given you the City verse 20 am so the people shouted when the priest blew with the trumpet and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up to the city every man straight before him they took the city may God bless his word you may be seated the day of it was the seventh day of the [Music] battle the Army compassed the city seventh times [Music] the war strategy started by the general Joshua it was not to send missiles toward the walls it was not to launch bombs upon the city of the the walls there was another special strategy that was given that day I believe the same strategy will give the same result tonight what was that strategy J didn't say take the walls say shake it or be it up [Music] down he said that they will blow the trumpet by the priest and people will shout are we [Music] together do we have a priest tonight here do we have a people tonight here so the strategy is I will blow the trumpet and you will shout and the Wolves will fall that's why they did back then and the Bible say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen amen I don't have any trumpet though I have it I will sound The Trumpet of the word and you will shout I told you to be like kids children if or else the thing will pass you by amen and the prophet said in the message the provided way he preach uh the 1st December 53 paragraph paragraph 95 he said this oh you demon Iain you by the the Son of God Jesus of Nazareth to free these people come out of them he said let everybody pray certain are seeing there suffering from AR the man the woman sitting there suffering from the power of the devil and another one sitting there losing her head because of menopause he say each and every one of [Music] you is healed right [Music] now is truly healed right now and now listen in the name of the Lord Jesus AC if you accept it and rise up to your feet amen if you accept it and rise up to your feet you are healed right now amen your god-given Victory am [Music] amen he said this is the time to shout hallelujah amen and the walls of Jero and it was the enemy that is keeping you will fall to the ground and every Power of the devil will be broken in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] amen this is the time to shout to shout Victory hallelujah hallelujah I believe that with my heart he worked back then he will work tonight amen he worked back then he got to work tonight everywhere I preached this message works there's no reason for it to not work today yes my brothers and sisters this is exact in the message look to looking toward see April 1059 he said consider Joshua consider Joshua now listen before one rock ever come out of the building of the walls of Jericho are we together the the walls were there they said he had inches or some feet we don't know exactly where the the the the the chars were working driving up top of it they were thick very thick walls but before one rock ever come out of the building josua walked around the wall shouting Victory are we together before even one sign before even a little break on the wall the W was still there before Joshua are we together am amen Joshua walked around the the wall shouting victory for by faith he saw Victory am amen he knew that the W was coming down and he armed his man and they walk around the Run Jericho for seven days in full armor why was he doing that because he was looking at the Unseen it was the promise God made he said how much can you walk around your wheelchair are we together if there's somebody here on the wheelchair leave your body sitting there by your soul coming out of the wheelchair and start walking around the wheelchair amen how much can you walk around the wheelchair how much can you walk around the cancer even though you have a cancer tonight no matter the level leave it there by faith and start walking around by said now listen how much can you walk around sin even if it was the that you for a long time no matter what it is leave it there leave it there and just start walking around [Applause] amen not just walking around but sharing Victory hallu Hallelujah God gives the promise when you can see believe the one who's invisible amen when that posession comes into your heart and begins to purade saying I am the Lord who heals all that diseases no certain diseases all your diseases am amen when you see that everything else weakens away Joshua looked at theen and he walked around the world believing it will happen said it's all depend on what you are looking at hallelujah hallelujah let somebody tonight he's seeing his walls I'm not I'm saying this is the children meeting if you are very charismatic you're going to pass by said you walking around the thing leave your thing there start walking around stand up walking around it walking around it keep walking around it keep walking away your problem shouting Victory shouting Victory no matter your problem your disease live there start walking around no matter your sin leave it there stop walking around no matter the disease even the whe CH come out stop walking around shouting victory victory glory to God the thing will happen yes my brothers and sister heavens and earth will pass away by the word of God will never pass away amen yes my brothers and sisters now listen the woman with the blood issue I love to tell this story that woman with the blood issue she got a miracle from God she didn't have any promise I will raise your holy jealousy she didn't have any promise she didn't have the Holy Spirit she was under the the sacrifice of the the bows and the Lambs because was before the cross are we together she didn't have any reference neither in the Bible neither in this history nobody ever done it before now listen even more she did one thing against the word she had the blood the Lord was saying the woman with the blood issue has to stay on the side she cannot touch anybody but that woman she went to that meeting tonight that night it was a Wednesday night she went to enter message Tabernacle that night she was telling to herself if only I can touch I will be healed and when she got there she didn't even ask for permission the disciple wereing no matter the opposition amen she believed in her heart that was possible if somebody beli tonight the same way the thing will happen you you are in a better position than that woman you under the perfect sacrifice under the blood of the Lamb the god in the message of the under the glory of the clouds the pill of fire tonight if you decide you will see it yes my brothers and sisters this is the truth that works it got to work yes in Roman chapter 10 verse 10 Romans chapter 10:10 the Bible says for it's by believing from the heart do are we together unto right and with the mouth confession is made un salvation the complete salvation amen from your body your salvation of your body your soul and your spirit everything if you understand well this text believing doesn't is not enough you have to speak it are we together believing is not enough it's by believing with your heart and confessing with your mouth that you made unto salvation don't stand still believing in your heart only that day with if sister just said if she just said it in your heart if she didn't speak it out I don't believe that Miracle would have happened she believed in her heart and she said brother Bram what you said there it's the exact truth am amen believing it's not enough tonight tonight you have to believe and speak it out and confess it believe and act upon it said believe that you heal say that you healed and act as somebody that is already been healed Hallelujah start acting as if someone is already been healed and God himself will make your body match your testimony that's the same thing for the Salvation believe that you are saved don't let somebody tell you tonight that you going to hell who is he to tell you you're going to hell tell him that you going to heaven believe that you are saved amen and confess that you are healed and sa and start acting like AED person for the rest God will take care of it amen start confessing speak it out it's by believing with the [Music] amen that you go onto righteousness with the mouth confession for [Applause] God there's a link between the heart and the mouth the heart believes but the mouth has to speak it out the scripture says it's from the abundance of the hearts that the mouth speaks that means if you don't speak it out that means there's nothing in there if there's nothing God doesn't do anything amen yes my brother beloved Brothers brother bham said in the message believe thou this January 15 paragraph 30 he said now listen notice Mary didn't wait till she was positive she was going to have this child when the angel came to her she the angel told her that she was going to be a mother she didn't wait for the next month if she will see that or not no amen she didn't wait till she felt the life before she said something about [Music] it she started right away testifying telling people that she was going to have this baby when there was no sign of it yet oh God give us some more Maries tonight that's true don't wait for signs and wonders take God his word say start rejoicing saying it's going to happen God said so amen testify tell your neighbor Jesus heals tell your neighbor I'm Healed tell the person behind you I am healed I am healed amen yes my brothers and sisters God said so I believe if every paent in this building right now will accept it upon the ground of the word of God and believed it and start testifying not just believing but start testifying Pastor I am healed amen yes my brother testify not just believe testify Hallelujah tesy for your healing praising God for your healing the meeting will close with one without one person being God is obligated to answer his word amen yes my brothers and sisters don't wait for the Improvement to start testifying I want to tell you the Improvement it's not the sign the proof that you are healed it can improve today and get worse tomorrow is it the truth but the infallible evidence of your healing is the infallible word of God when God said it by his stripes you are healed don't look the symptom or the signs don't look at the symptoms the true evidence is the word of God not the the Improvement temporary Improvement it can change today tomorrow it get worse do somebody hearing me amen yes my brothers and sisters this is the exact truth amen amen praise God by his stries you are healed that is the truth the proof of your healing stand there and start testifying the walls will fall and they already been Fallen I saw them falling amen I saw your W [Applause] falling that's why I'm not saying that they will fall I'm saying tonight the walls have fallen amen the Bible says everything that you shall ask the father in my name believe it in the present tense there three things believe that's right now that you already received it in the past and you shall see them being fulfill in the future are we together you believe now present tense you already receive it but it will be fulfill in the future but in the meantime there's nothing that's faith faith is not when you touch it faith is not when you see it faith is when you believe it's already happened while there's nothing here it will be manifested let somebody say Amen yes my brothers and sisters Hallelujah no want somebody healed tonight this word never fail it will never fail here yes sir praise God Amen now listen second Corinthians chapter 4 that is my beloved scripture of the Bible verse 13 Corinthians chapter 413 my Bible says we having the same Spirit of Faith according to as is written I believed therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore we speak I don't believe in a quiet Faith or silence Faith what a faith that doesn't speak can make a a dumb speak the faith himself doesn't speak how can you make somebody speak the faith speaks the faith speaks the faith testify Faith confess because we believe that's why we speak Hallelujah am I remember one time I asked God back home is not like here things are easy here having a car back home it's really a luxury I asked God give me a car I waited I couldn't see anything I said I have to make a first step I went to get my license my driver license and I got my driver license at that time I didn't even have $10 sparing I got my driver license I got my driver license no call I said I have to speak now one day one Sunday in a great meeting I give that testimony I have my driver license here I I said you don't get the driver license to walk by feet I don't need a driver license to start walking I pay for this permit of this driver license to drive a car not long ago I don't want to get into details I Got a Car amen why as long as I was keeping my driver lense the God was not coming I have to believe and speak it out and I started speaking it out and testifying amen brothers and sisters God will never fail because we believe that's why we speak amen if you believe speak it out tell again your neighbor what I was looking I got it what I was looking I already got it amen I got it no matter your needs let it be a spiritual need let it be a physical need no matter the needs because we believe we speak it out speak it again speak it again yes my brothers and sisters that's the truth infallable truth of God when the the crowd is shouting and they heard the trumpet of the word and the shout the walls to fall no matter what it is it never fails and it will never fail in the message from this time uh 20 May uh 61 listen this is very important paragraph uh 57 said by his stes I'm Healed now he's speaking about his own testimony amen amen he saying I had a stomach trouble and Satan told me if he told the prophet he can tell you what did he say he kept telling me now you're not you're not not any better today if you have that thought who's talking to you if you're having that thought where you are you're not getting any better there's no any change it's the Satan's talking to you you know you can't eat nothing that's the devil talking to you says I would just eat anyhow and I will vomit it up in about two minutes after Satan said you cannot eat but eat and vomited out now he said I said I'll eat it again now be careful follow it's not when you vomit now it's over I cannot eat anymore the true Satan you were right I tried to do my best now I vomit I'm just waiting for death that's it I will eat it some more and then V up again and and eat again do you follow that it's a conflict between God and Satan amen and I'll eat it again and V eat it again and Satan told me you know you are just making a disgrace and I said the Satan is telling him don't don't play around you're not healed you're just putting a disgrace in the name of Jesus just admit that you sick just admit it it's over and I said look here because when he's speaking you speak back i i before continuing I live that I experienced that you know in my head here there was something wrong in my head yeah right here in the front head Spirit was telling me you got to uh sin sinus and I told in my heart no and then the spirit told me again you got a sign here but I said I got to speak it out I said no I could be with somebody speaking with something else you heard me saying no but you don't know who I are talking to I was talking to somebody [Music] else then we continue do you don't feel it that you still have the S you got it remember your friend of yours that have it that's the way you're feeling it that's how how you people feel I said no we've been doing that for two weeks finally it was over it was gone it never came back I had another friend one day he started coughing like that and then when he coughed there was a blood and we were there we wanted to say uh this is the TB we were ready to say this is TB when he saw that you know what he told us you know what it is he didn't let us answer he said it's because I have more blood God wanted me to get rid of some blood so that I won't have a dizzy I don't feel dizzy and we stay quiet and never he never cough blood anymore all depends on what you say Amen said he said I said look here you who who is he talking to he's talking to the devil you SL feet you you're slow to understand listen the great principle can we read it together let's read well let's all read [Music] together if you want to hear me testify stick around but if you are getting sick of it then get out let's all read it let's all read it let together if you want to hear me testify stick around but if you are getting sick of it get out are we together are we together if you want to hear me testify stick around I will keep testifying I'm Healed I'm Healed if you want to hear me testify stay there but when you are getting sick of it I'm me testify now get it out amen amen amen amen because I'm going to testify As Long As I Got the breath in my body amen I'm going to give God praise for letting Jesus Christ come to the Earth to heal [Applause] me not saying to heal us all amen because he doesn't know your faith he God sent Jesus on the earth only to heal me myself now listen I accept it as my personal property [Music] meaning healing is a personal property it's your property don't let anybody to touch it protect it by your testimonies Satan if you want to hear me testify just stick around amen but if you are getting seek of it just get out find somewhere to go because I'll keep testifying as long as I have the Breath of Life in my body hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah because it's a personal property it's not a property for myself and my wife this is this is a personal this is personal private my wife can do what she wants with it it's not a share property with my children no with my church everybody's taking it as his personal property Hallelujah now listen said he left me sure now listen the the wickedness of the weakness of the devil it gets tired of hearing you testifying about Jesus if you understand well we will make him tired tonight testify as I'm speaking tell your neighbor I'm Healed anytime you feel like saying it remind your neighbor I'm Healed any time you feel it because the devil gets tired of hearing you testify it's not because you keep it in your heart it's by believing with your heart by confessing with your mouth it's because we believe that's why we speak it out amen yes my brothers and sisters we speak he gets tired of hearing you testify about Jesus it tries to get you away from it while you are testifying your pain can increase can you hear me while you are testifying your pain can get worse why to get you away from your testimony to make you quiet or to make you change your testimony no don't you change it if I already said I'm Healed I'm not going to change it I am healed I am healed even if it gets worse I am not changing my testimony because his strategy it's either to make you quiet or to make you change your testimony I said you Slew Foot if you want to hear me testify stick around and testify I testify but when you going to get really tired of it and you get out say it left me because the only thing that makes the devil tired is the testimony on Jesus Christ that's all makes him tired amen don't get tired of the devil make him tired by your testimony amen make him tired by your testimony I see somebody being blessed tonight I start feeling well tonight amen he wants to get you away from but don't you do it you have met God God is present you know he's there and here is his promise revealed to you what is the Promise by Stripes I am healed not that we are all healed but I am healed amen amen amen amen but saying then something happens am amen yes my brothers and sisters Satan get tired of of hearing you testify amen now when you testify the Bible says Jesus Christ is a high priest not of what we think in our heart but on what we confess what we say what we testify amen keep telling somebody tell somebody that I'm Healed my request is answered amen my request is answered Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus Christ is alive amen God sent him to the Earth for me to answer my needs to meet my expectations I love this song that I was sang here before introducing me I almost cry in my office I said Lord Jesus come down tonight come down tonight and act for the case of my brother for the case of my sister yes my brother and sister amen that's the exact truth infallible truth of God I was preaching this message in Paris no there was a sister that went to check up they did a scanner the greatest American
