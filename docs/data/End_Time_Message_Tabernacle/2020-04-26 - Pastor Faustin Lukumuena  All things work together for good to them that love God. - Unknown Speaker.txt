Jesus Christ and these special greetings go to the Sunday School teachers are the Sunday school children hello everyone hello everyone I cannot hear you can everybody in the house say hello and praise the Lord thank you god bless you ah this morning like this entire week I get a little bit the opportunity and privilege to think about the Sunday school children for the last I don't know how many weeks four or five weeks we did not have the opportunity to have gatherings in this sanctuary therefore there was no opportunity to have a Sunday school but Sunday school children I wanted to let you know this morning that you are loved and you are not forgetting and we do care for you and that's the reason why before the service this morning I want to address your little group and in order to do so I want all the sunday school children in your home to stand up on your feet as I want to sing with you this song jesus loves me let us sing with all our voices and clap as much as we can to show God that we love him because of his love jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so little ones to him belong they are weak but he is strong yes jesus loves me yes jesus loves me yes jesus loves me their Bible tells me so Jesus loves me he will die heaven's gates to open what he will wash away my scene let his little chart come in yes jesus loves me yes jesus loves me yes jesus loves me the Bible tells me so Jesus loves me loves me steam though I am very weak and in from his shining phone on high guns to watch me when I learn yes jesus loves me yes jesus loves me [Music] yes jesus loves me the Bible tells me so one more time yes jesus loves me yes jesus loves me yes jesus loves me the Bible tells me so amen amen amen amen may God bless you you may be seated for a while thank you each one of you and let me ask you a few questions here are you all doing well the family doing good how are you spending your time during this time where there is no church there is no Sunday School there is no sunday school homework either and there is no school let me tell you something that this is an opportunity for me and I even say it's a greater privilege just to let each one of you know that we care for you we cannot spend all this month just playing but a bottom tapes and having services may be sermon with the grown up without addressing the little one from our Sunday school the entire week as I said has been a huge burden as I start meditating I say what about the the ones we need to tell them something we need to address them as well we need to let them know that we always bear them in our mind and pray for them and I believe also that you also pray for the pastor way for the offices of the church the deacon the trustees these song leaders the Sunday School teachers the musician and the entire congregation because the little ones they are very closer to God and when they play God always listen so we thank God for each one of you and this morning I want hour before addressing the grown up group to say a few words to your attention and without any doubt I believe you have been each one of you a good child a good character like the name most of you have from the Bible and a message character so without further delay I want to read a portion of the scripture for the young people to know what the little responsibilities are let us turn as the sunday school kids can stand for the reading of the Bible as we open our Bibles in the book of Proverbs proverbs the very first chapter proverb chapter one I want to read from verse seven if you find it from your Bible you can say Amen so that your parent can know you are now in activities you are serving God you are reading your Bible and you are paying attention to the lesson going on this morning as I'm making this audio for the Sunday school kids so from verse 70 Bible said the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction my son hear the instruction of the father and forsake not the law of thy mother made a lot add a blessing to the reading of the scripture you may be seated so my little message for you today is as you all see what is taking place this is something they never be opened before this is to show that we are at the end of the time this is a sign that our this world is dying if you can go outside for those who have the opportunity or look through the window you can see the street completely empty those who have the privilege to go to the shop to store you can see that it's like a dead City this is to tell you that the time to go home is close don't despise your u4h but instead lift up your head to know that they're going home time is here we have so far been trying to do our best to educate you to show you the way to serve the Lord but we don't know for our long steel we will be on this earth I own listening to me are you paying attention we don't want to be distracted and don't distract others please sit down relax pay close attention and don't sleep down to talk you may be some of you may be looking say well we know that voice we are trying to look where is he yes I'm just making the audio not a video just to communicate through this system you can hear my voice speaking to you so coming back to our topic so the going home time is close so we need to prepare ourself so as young people don't take this time or you know there is no school there is no homework there is no sunday school activities so what you have been doing let me ask you the question what have you been doing during this time without school without a church have you been praying have you been serving the Lord have you been helping your parent have you been obedient to your parent and today older or elders elders in your families if you want to make the rapture those who questions need to be addressed you don't need to come to Sunday school in order to be a good Christian but wherever you are whatever you are who you are doing always keep the Lord in mind that Jesus Christ is watching so therefore you need to continue to obey your parent respecting them respect the rules of the house and during his time give some hands to your parent your especially the girls have your bed you always affixed clean up the sisters in the kitchen helping the mom with the food cleaning up the dishes cleaning up the room especially during this time of crisis with the virus going on we need to maintain our home clean if we can disinfect our kitchen our bedroom our bathrooms so that germs cannot come and attack the family and above all to be clean ourselves to wash our hands and to be very careful in everything we are doing not to go on the street to shake people hands you know all the things we have to be very very careful and I trust that that's what you have been doing so may God richly bless you coming to the scripture we've had the Bible said the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge so if you want to grow in the fear of the Lord and the knowledge of the Lord rather you have to learn how to fear the Lord it's not time to read magazines to play with the forms and have no time at all for prayer yo that's not right I want to exhort you this morning and going forward every day read your Bible well if you pray in a family that's great but most likely when you have your free time leave your sibling from time to time go into your bedroom kneel down pray and come out and do the rest of the thing and the from time to time go back into your room somewhere kneel down raise up your hand like Daniel in Babylon and pray God is certainly going to appreciate it and God is going to answer your prayer and will strengthen your household that will also strengthen their family so the next verse verse eight say my son I can adhere my son or my daughter here always the instruction of the Father dot verse eight the father is the head of the household he has instructions for you he will tell you what to do if your dad tell you go heat go pray go meditate please obey please do it and respect because the Bible said where we had the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge so when you do that God sees what you are doing certainly God is going to bless you and the Bible said my son here the instruction of thy father and they add a contraction and forsake not the law of thy mother so God has given you a father to give you instructions and have also given you a mother to instruct you weave law and the teaching and directions on how to serve the Lord so my the main portion of my message is also to let you know that I know some of you can say well we don't listen to the voice of the pastor we don't see the pastor now we are playing tapes we are playing tapes sometimes we don't get it sometimes this sometimes that let me tell you brother Branham is our prophet the one God has sent to us with a special message with instructions and laws for us to be prepare for the rapture so in order for the father the mother to give you instruction they have to take it from the Bible and today the voice of Malachi 4 brother Branham the Prophet according to Malakal for our prophet is the breakdown or the way God has made it is simple for us to understand the Bible today is through the message so when we listen to the tape is means we are listening straight from God through the mouth of his prophet and this is how the Bible is made we see the Bible said Paul wrote Moses wrote this book and all these different writers they have written the Bible and when we read the Bible we said Paul said it's not really Paul saying it's God saying through the lips of porn and when we listen to the message is God speaking to us through the lips of brother branham so let me tell you those tapes every greater value everything the pastor preaches everything the Sunday School teachers preaches tells you they get them from the tapes and the books from brother Branham so at home when it's time to listen to the message just pray first and say note I don't want to be distracted Lord I don't want to add my mind elsewhere lord help me focus because now that the past has spoken to us when we listen to the tape it's God speaking through the lips of brother Branham oh my god let me listen to the voice of God let me listen to what God has to tell me today in different sermons that brother Bonham has ad preached do you get it let me say it in a very one more simple way so we need to be very reverent and focused when we are playing tapes and keep keeping in mind it's God speaking to us through the lips of brother Branham and whenever we go to church the pastor is preaching we know the pastor is speaking from what the prophet has spoken and what if prophet is a spoken-- coming from God so let me tell you just be very very reverent we be very focused and one is time for service please respect the time please respect to the service let's say if we have a service Wednesday night or we are going to listen to a tape just be prepared the service starts at 7:00 p.m. let us by 6:30 p.m. we all read all already in the living room or wherever whom you gather in the family to pray take a seat those who know how to write take a piece of paper with a pencil or a pen just be ready and when you go there 30 minutes before start playing say Lord I don't know what you have for us today but open my little understanding to what God is speaking through the lips of a brother branham and let me get to something that will help me to be prepared for the rapture and Sunday morning by 9:30 I don't know I may speak to the with the Sunday School teachers I believe if we continue to be in this condition we'll weave if you all kids want it please let me know ask your parent I need to talk to the pastor and it give me the pastor I want to talk to the pastor and let me know what you want if it's okay that at 9:30 in your home that we can have a short service 30 minutes every Sunday going forward until we resume the gardening the church 9:30 if all the kids can be ready at their post of duty 9:30 then we can sing two songs and then have maybe a short message of exhortation of encouragement so that you can pray and then by 10 o clock we start the service altogether if it's okay we can do that otherwise from time to time we will send you a audio or a video like this a audio like this or maybe maybe a video or just tell you something that you should be reading before service or during the week so my love to each one of you I love you I appreciate you may God bless you this is a little message I add for my lovely children of the sunday school at the entire message Tabernacle may God richly bless you let us bow our head so that I can say a word of prayer for you pressure 7li father we thank you for this little portunity to speak to the sunday school kid father you know some of them may not understand what is going on some may have just a very limited understanding of what is taking place but I'm playing father as they are going up to help each one of them during this time with a lot of restrictions they cannot go to school they cannot go to Sunday school they cannot go outside but I pray that you protect each one of them and to use them in a special way to heat the world to play on their own and to pray for the church to pray for the country so the distance situation can be changed so that we can resume our normal life bless them father protect them against all these sicknesses and protect them against any other sickness as well father make them strong physically spiritually and bless their little life help them also during this time to assist their parent in whatever task they have to do keep their home clean everything in order for your glory sake I commit them all into your hand and I pray that you open up their mind so that they can always know that they are in our mind they are not being forgotten or rejected we
