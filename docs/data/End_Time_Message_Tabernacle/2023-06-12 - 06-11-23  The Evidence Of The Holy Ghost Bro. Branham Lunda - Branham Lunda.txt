listening to the pastor's readings and receiving blessings that he gave us from where he is right now amen amen if you can play a little message we love the brothers and time message Tabernacle beloved brothers and sisters my uh precious church I want to greet you all in the precious and mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ the lord the god of Israel and I want to transmit my greeting from

that's all for today our brother Julian yeah Fred Julian Julian Julian please you make me standing to read uh we are reading in the Book of John chapter 14. verse 25th from verse 25 to 26. we are reading in the name of the Lord Jesus shows amen amen these things I've spoken onto onto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever have said unto you in English okay I know these things are things that we already know and we are very familiar with it was a long plans chapter five from verse 26 all the way to the end I mean uh verse 22 all the way to the end Tampines foreign by the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are in Christ have crucified the flesh with the affection and lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirious of vain Glory provoking one another envying one another thank you very much you may be seated may God bless the reading of his word uh donkey Japanese I was thinking of taking another subject this morning man very much [Music] but since uh I closed up the the subject I was talking about on Wednesday I was thinking of taking another subject that was already in me my time is God led me this morning to come back to the same old things I don't know why not but we thank God I have survey Israel uh you know Israel when the we're walking to the promised land is they were hungry a certain time a God gave them manner and that manner was falling in the morning and you could take in the morning and make food out of it man Israel is a family as the familiarism but after a while Israel got used to the Mana and they told Moses we are fed up with this manner it's always the same thing over and over can we change some other food foreign I believe God will bless somebody this morning I'm foreign [Music] the last time we spoke about the fruit that manifests the Holy Spirit when it's placed in the center of the new spirit amen amen if we want to recap a little bit there are two different things that takes the Holy Spirit and put it in the new hearts in the center of the new spirit amen amen and we saw that that new spirit is the spirit that convinced you that the word of God is the truth the tennis it's a spirit that makes you realize that this is wrong this is good it makes you realize or make the decision that you should be baptized you can start even to wanting to leave the word the Venom was worried they said and the meaning of Billy Graham amen even in his own meetings they give the life to Jesus Christ among the thousand thousand people that believe these days you only find ten just few numbers foreign they don't have faith to stand all the way to the end is that makes them to impersonate Christianity he was just emotions the word is spoken therefore God convinced you you accepted cases you accept Christ upon the basis of the word if God decides some scientists it takes his holy spirit he places it in the center of your new spirits that person one will be unshakable if they won't be any emotions that is why you can see somebody being bad you can shout hallelujah after the same time it started saying uh like that old skin please I don't I won't be coming to that church anymore the message doesn't belong to Brothers It's the message of God sent for you and me amen amen that is why the birds fly [Applause] [Applause] foreign God God comes in the center of the new spirit we're so better when I'm saying it makes you Meek that's the message in that message I'm just repeating few scriptures from last Wednesday these are the same scripture we read on Wednesday foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] no matter what you have done amen amen foreign anyhow remember even if they are good brothers and sisters but they are now still from the inside it's true when they receive Jesus they receive the new spirit the new Hearts to confirm it by sealing you on the inside but when God feels you'll say foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] despise the Temptation [Applause] you will believe the word hallelujah hallelujah [Music] you two seconds everything that the Messenger will say you will stay every today I want to tell you foreign [Music] [Music] amen amen shows those are the things for the Ephesian Church that is why he just died for that bride amen amen he got put his holy spirit in you never per day he won't say may not welcome to your personal now that you have sinned Stephanie it's over now you go out of nowhere [Music] I did wrong the only ghost will come back amen amen um continues paragraph 62 in the same message the lamb the door of the Lamb that spirit is sweet and meek like you are now huh amen the Holy Spirit The Humble mixed spirit that you had before you and your God you remember that you can remember it's true fight back today now said Daphne you became all tempered foreign [Music] [Music] you became so difficult fussy if he's still very difficult if you say something someone that is difficult friend brother almost [Music] it's better to know when somebody gets mad you know the person when he's married we're gonna pray but we already know when he gets married we know the relation fabricate they don't want manufactured relief but when you are difficult we don't know we can't tell when you're mad or understand we can't tell when you enjoy see when they do good to you for you it's evil God when evil happens to you it's everything someone who's difficult toward his wife a wife difficulty scientists the Holy Spirit just goes away it's difficult Christian Church it says this is my church may never show up foreign [Music] [Music] the Holy Spirit flew away amen amen if I have the Holy Spirit within me the Holy Spirit when I do evil you will bring me to recognize the evil that I've done since the only spirit in me doesn't recognize evil that I've done predicate all these Same Spirit can and now and through the world I can understand oh I have done wrong here that's why I lost the joyous salvation the joy of Salvation that went away because it's no longer because when is there it gives you the joy of Salvation amen amen forever is naming things that will make the Holy Spirit flies away he says [Music] the holy spirit is not the author of confusion amen amen Stone Travis decreased his job is to unite the body the big body of Christ his job is to unite the body of Christ amen amen powerless Spirit not the spirit of division problem I see a problem I'll take advantage of it to divide to separate the Believers brother is there any problem in your church brother you can come to our church because you know Libra you're a free brother foreign [Music] no [Music] light or you see but come here since I preached here you are the people that I've I've wanted come to my church everywhere I'm invited I'm bringing my little stones to bring the souls to Christ not to cross the light this is not the work of the Holy Spirit [Music] a man of God we work not to make a name out of it not to have a big church objective but our only one person is to bring the beliefs to have a relationship with the Creator not to bring them to church but it happens people have good forgotten that yeah instead of uniting people they separate them demons [Music] pleasing things that is why when you tell me where the Venom I I even quotation knows how to preach sent us maybe the Holy Spirit preach according to you I Don't Preach for people too I preach because I know what I say here I feel responsible I'm responsible before God even the devil knows I never having any change we have the fear and we respect the people of God please because you are more precious than the blood of Jesus we don't play politics light friends I preach in Africa we have church in the neighborhood preachers when they see there's a new member in the city Congo maybe they're coming from Congo when they get there is today the brother Fellowship in that church I believe one week two weeks I'm telling you through things true stories other preachers from other churches do I have Alexis they have to

sometimes they just don't see things that are coming out of your mouth people want to see written bible Living Bible to convince them Why Us down semester in this message the Glorious message that had to go to the world why the Holy Spirit [Music] all kinds of cows people that never heard the name of Jesus there are many out there let's go bring them to receive Jesus Christ by people they're already in the message they already receive Jesus [Music] the action of the Holy Spirit never been to force separation you're gonna tell me the world is the holy word came to separate the the person to uh with his parents we yes when they don't want to land themselves to the world if you bring that to separate people already in Christ we understand the one who does that is the old serpenters and

the mouth of God paragraphs [Music] preached on the 26th July evening 64. the most perfect evidence it's love dunk then and we got to talking on them he was talking with someone about it hello then I found that sounded pretty good dog so Germany I just heard that when a man has got lost [Music] the Lord in a vision straightened me out and he said the evidence that of the spirit says was those who could receive the word Jesse [Music] ID Jesus said God Louis when did he listened as priests the Holy Ghost is come upon you show us he will reveal these things to you that I've got you and I will show you things to come [Music] so there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Spirit he has never taught me anything wrong yet that is the evidence of the Holy Spirit he's he who can believe the word you can receive it because when the Holy Ghost is come you speak with tongues [Music] [Music] so there is the genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost According To Jesus himself amen amen amen amen beloved amen foreign [Music] [Music] the sentence that one um but when it comes the Holy Spirit he receives the word he received the entire world they are people of science because people of science they will tell you [Music] we're going to take you to the hospital we're gonna take care of it and after that care of all your belongings [Music] we're gonna give you everything is why they don't even believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ that's not the kind of love we're talking about amen amen is the love in the word of God do you love the prophet just feed upon the word now Lafayette trumpet the Feast of the trumpet forever said you know in the time of Jesus Jesus was living in a different world Jesse Jesus was the Fulfillment of the scripture at that time but notice his behavior he got to the temple Jesus was going to church he was God coming on the earth to show us to set an example effect of coming to church is very important because many people have the quotes that they place around here they think basketball it's true the fact of God coming to church that's not what saves you that's a celebrity that's the truth when you take that code to give yourself an excuse because you don't want to come to listen to the world it's a sign that you are backsliding but Jesus himself he was going to church gets to the temple when he got there he saw that please offering that people had Legends people brought animals and they were taking animals and now we're gonna trade whosoever wants to buy he can buy this Protestant even today these things still happening in the protesting church
