========================================

may the Lord bless you may God bless you I wanted to take this opportunity to read this uh words of of encouragement that has been sent to me I think two years ago or a year or so by a pastor and upon that basis I wanted to read that today as we wish to honor our pastor that can comfort him and that can also Comfort us all a pastor a very hard work nobody knows what a pastor hears what he sees the secret he must keep Temptation he encounters the tears he shed the sorrow he endures the loness he deals with the grievance he experiences it's sometime not being understood by his biological family sometime he's not being understood by the church he leadth the lies told against him by some of the people he serves how he welcomes those that claim to love him by being hand them they destroy him how he tries to live more than [Music] human the lack he suffers from the Discrimination to which he must not react the accusation silence the expectation he strives to face even if fellow Pastor doesn't know what he the other is going through he lives for God and yet he lives for us a pastor and the Pastoral Care is what no one can fully understand the word Pastor is a mystery the pastor himself is also a mystery and a mystery is an comprehens Inc comprehensible and intelligibility and therefore so all you can do for him is to pray for him a day must not go by without him being in the gap wish him luck and try to understand him at least pleased him because an unhappy Pastor is a disaster for the Church of God respect your pastor pray for your pastor encourage your pastor honor and celebrate your pastor and therefore stop judging pastors because of what you have heard or seen may God bless you all in this day for all your prayers for all your sacrif and your support as you honor your pastor amen amen
