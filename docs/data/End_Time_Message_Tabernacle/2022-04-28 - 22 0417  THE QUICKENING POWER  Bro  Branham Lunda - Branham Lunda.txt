christ i greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen thank you very much for coming thank you so much dear pastor to give us the trust to bring forth the word of god the pastor i'd like to thank the pastor polar yeah you've seen that he started to speak to us on the preparation time sapri and bonmo it took a little while and ukraine and by then we started the question of the message [Music] some others spoke about it and some were afraid and then afterwards it brought us to a series of consecrations tooth sessions and all these things that one guy is about to do something he prepares his people preparation and i think that we come here to pray before prophecy the is one to gotta send this message is to prepare us for that and in the series of consecrations personally i was blessed i believe you were also i can see how much people are really coming for venice may god bless you jesus and people are heated by and then after a while and people will cool down again that's the devil's work amen amen that's promise to god okay that even after tomorrow today that uh that revival in the heart may keep on asking do we promise that yeah and to keep love in the heart amen amen you know when jesus and this morning i would like also to tell you shalom shalom shalom shalom means peace be with you if there was trouble somewhere shallow shalom [Music] shocking start and every time that the doors are open and you available don't give the devil the chance let's come to listen to the word amen amen and death where is your sting oh death death ways today i said that's uh a true christian faith it's not the new year's feast yeah well you see people on january 1st no those are pagan is something i'd like to come back on something brother martin is spoken about may god bless [Applause] uh he was really wonderful amen amen [Music] but don't get used to the ministry or to somebody but take profit of what god has when you spoke about the preparation and the qualifying lamb jesus christ the lamb that was jesus christ i like to speak slowly but together i'll interpret to help the interpreter so that people who only understand english can also learn quickly you showed us that the land had to qualify and make us notice that we are also learning and god wants us to be learned and god wants us also to qualify he could get married but he didn't do it he didn't even have a house i believe that everything that is beautiful comes from the devil eh jesus and jesus christ says sanctified sanctifying himself for our interests for your interest that's what qualified him [Applause] god wants us also to qualify what this calvary meant to us therefore we want to have faith in what we're doing therefore christ going to calvary there will be three things that we have to look on there on calvary what calvary meant to us a and what we have to do after understanding what calvary meant to us and i won't take too much time otherwise it's be from the subject but i want us to notice what calvary is signified for us that has freed us from sin amen amen regardless of decision regardless of what you've done yes but freeze you la foreign the way is open they played if you're still condemning yourself always and all right there's two things there and first probably you condemning yourself because you have not repented and he will bring you to condemnation but if you uh straighten it up and you see the devil still bringing that to your mind but maybe if the brother is on the other side oh what do he you are [Music] and you to help me preach only it's only to say amen if it's the word amen amen and that's what calvary has done for us say to your brother i have no sin brother i have no sin hallelujah hallelujah second jeffy what i know that i'm conscious that i've done wrongs but i'll repent amen amen and repentance that it is the son of god but if you see somebody say completely repenting in the very complicated ways you were committed adultery therefore respect somebody that represents yourself it's not a weakness say some people are previously that's even the proof that he's the son he or she is the son of god but that thing has disappeared among the christians may god help us therefore we have to know that that day on calvary that because he [Applause] don't think that if you suffer france that you think that your my suffering is uh greater than the other one if you're really a christian do your secret you do have one conflict god knows that you have to have a call hallelujah amen and if the sufferings that you have if the condition that you have [Applause] the test that god is putting there um i think that i'm just going to leave the church oh i'm i'm leaving the message i'm going back to the catholics that shows that you're not a christian christ christ taking your place and [Applause] even the disciple that he loved him much john oh he was always leaning on his uh at that moment he was not there peter was saying no perspective if [Applause] forsake you what about even your friend has to forsake you and you have to say this is my calvary okay may somebody say amen fred brother probably we don't know how long we shall live if we never understood easter in the good way let it be this year let's get down the mountain to understand god is not going to take away the deceptive disappointment [Applause] and he has the solution let's unfold the bread mass the evil children were walking but it's a process while they were coming getting closer and fire was even getting bigger left breath and the either the trial becomes even greater deeply you pray deeply you pray you fast you pray but the situation only gets worse the devil comes you see god doesn't love you you see the other one has left you now that one was promising you might he didn't give him god allows those kinds may somebody say amen but don't forget que abra that abraham have ffa vincent you spent 25 years and probably your your trial has only taken two years probably just three years but first or probably it's just a month you had faith now but you're for sure and you started changing prayers but god is testing you when shadrach was working please demo he was walking and sometimes god likes to do those things you really get to the end he wanted to see it continue if you will keep on believing just the same as it from the beginning hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] we need to each one of us have their own cavalry hello [Applause] jesus never lives for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say that you're good you go to church and you do go do things that's fine but when you leave your life to yourself you haven't eternal life you follow me if you go to church you do good deeds they're bonnie shows good things it's good but when if when you live your life to yourself you don't have eternal life that's the reason why he went to calvary it's a situation and this has to change our lives amen amen seed yes and if and you receive and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others sorry someone see people that have to come to church all those things when you go to calvary you start considering your brother and you give him more value you don't criticize him you just try to encourage him amen you don't live for yourself you live for others listen carefully my friends vive poor and the trouble of it is the church has forgotten escalation are people sleeping the thing is that the church has forgotten what have we forgotten remember mistakes the devil has traded us in this easter comedy is to revive something that is already in you yes and that has to bring me so much love amen amen oh brother says foosette defeats us brother brother i can live for this brother because he's a brother he's sure a nice man oh that brother is very good i said sir oh no that's sister james i like the other one because it's more empathic that's not christian life equity listen live for that man who hates you there's no there's no amen when you say amen the holy ghost comes into you essa morality these are not morality it is not a civic muslim or good ways of living that's not it sir this second christian name this is when christ is born in you that preacher you can pray for the person that wants to kill you amen with your faith that's what they did to him they killed him he died then you go [Applause] [Applause] you give [Applause] uh your life and let's find the person who never loved you give them everywhere and see the person who really hates you the most and go to your knees and pray you say lord if you really in my life okay give me the heart the message person like a vegemite and to pray and pray for the person who really wants something for you and that's the proof that you saved i hope this helps you to get in a place amen when you love somebody who can even kill you and you're even ready to live for the person you'll pray for them you'll know that that's not him it's the devil behind him amen we will be a mighty do you think that god cannot do it may receive that spirit see let's preach jesus if you are the spirit that has resurrected jesus from the dead lives in you he will quicken your moral bodies and we have something to shout about amen amen now that it is the greatest week in history the greatest celebration of all times it is a easter where he has he proved what he had said love said men can say until it's been proved to be the truth are trying to say that we should wash our feet once a year less eddie on the on thursday levante de la comino the short concert and on friday we should take the communion and all these different doctrines they argue about whether you should be uh this day or that day who said everything is the shortcoming or whether you should be a sabbath day or the first day of the week all these brothers with things i'm saying that are just merely tradition
