make up the seasonings I just want to thank the Lord for what he's done in my family pupils like love based on what about me he's truly done miracles and wonders in my family in me like a birthday or not about me as many of you know my parents were sick behind him a lot and I just want to kind of relate how it all started in how God healed them hey come suck it open also come on Julie's are getting so it all started a couple months ago she wants to get the apostate Justin my kid was a cold hey somebody comes to that you're saying if you have much just like we have the regular cool that's what it was my latitude but as time went on a retention rate they just weren't healing from the cold hey mr. Gillis it but you said malady and it just seemed like the symptoms are getting worse and worse anyways ridiculous them don't stay some period we started trying to treat our home with Tylenol and all the medications no comedy nothing was getting better yeah okay so at that point I believe mom was the one who was really worst at that time I believed at that time mom was getting worse really bad at that time there's a bucket so we decided to call the doctor and see what we can do we can prepare and just like they're telling people just stay home don't come under needless telomeres only variable we don't have any treatment for you or anything stay home then I want buddy medicine they may become approval on his own but the medicine at home wasn't helping middle America Makino's a few animals only depart so we took her to the hospital alone is all about money I love you Doug since we don't we're allowed to go in me and dad waited in the car and she was in the hospital skinning they jump up tell me don't slow down kill my mobile after a while I go checking her doing different exams different different tests on her I play keys on Facebook we do they come enjoy well they just said that you know there's nothing we can do for her you're gonna be in you're gonna just go home and continue cheating it the way you were cheating it they gave us they give us a medication he's not gonna give me come on when I looked at the medication they can't really call this a medic and the symptoms that she was having a meal of it he had nothing to do that the medication was completely wrong they made a medical might've come out of the elderly diamond a symptom caliphate so I kind of lost my faith in the hospital like they're making mistakes to giving people the wrong medication every month on this opportunity Hyundai mobis made it made it come on so we just continued at home watching giving them treatment you know somebody's telling me they do not admit this team and I notice also dad started getting worse anyways am i picking my belt my daddy says on coffee OC and we decided to go I decided to say both of them to the hospital they did the same thing you don't put a Memphis x-rays images trying to see what's going on as long as they don't like out there sticking out your paw and I believe they saw some kind of you know something going on in the lung some kind of pneumonia it shows no need for more it just gives some kind of small breathing treatments although there's so many come on Pumas give us you know and they sent us back home where time is on a home it just felt like I would call different doctors different nurses what can I do alum is not ability doctor lady yeah everyone was coming up with their own suggestion give them this give them that so I tried everything that
