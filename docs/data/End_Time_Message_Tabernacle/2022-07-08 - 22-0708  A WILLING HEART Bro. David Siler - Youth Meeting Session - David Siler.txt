[Music] let's just buy our hearts together if we could heavenly father we come before you today and lord we are under expectations you are a god that answers prayer you hear the heart of your people and you hearken unto that prayer and you commanded us in your words and we should ask anything in your name so we come into this place today lord and we ask that you would just help us now and lord we are in great need of you we need your [Music] so we look to you [Music] it has been quite some time since we've been here but we are still striving to continue pressing the battle ain't no continuing still looking for the rapture believing amen i want to turn today into the scripture to the book of romans chapter twelve i want to go to the book of romans chapter 12 verse 1. and i want to speak from verses one and two today this is paul speaking to the roman church and he said i beseech you therefore brethren they would bring a lamb and that lamb would die and that would be a dead sacrifice but when paul comes to the new testament holy and acceptable unto god [Music] it means not to do not be conformed acceptable amen god bless you this morning you may be seated today praise the lord i want to speak to you this morning and the only way that we can present ourselves as a living sacrifice we must be willing to do it i want to start with this statement out of the message the lamb and the dove is to anchor he said but you've got to read the bible in the spirits you've got to be in the mood and you've got to love to read it and jesus thanked god and said father i thank thee that thou has hit these things through the wise and the prudence has revealed them [Music] you don't have to be somebody in this world to know god you just have to have a willing heart you don't have to be rich you don't have to be educated you just need a willing heart we look at this scripture that we read this morning paul is coming to the conclusion that he's proven beyond all doubts that because of jesus christ that our sacrifice has been brought to us under grace and paul is using an allegory he that we are only righteous in jesus christ i don't care what preacher someone bought the book but that is not what appeases to justice for a god counted inequity today jesus christ just given back to the church amen now i want to say this today paul tells us that we are only righteous in jesus christ and [Applause] [Music] but because of what christ is is [Applause] is [Music] the church that god never fills a man with a desire to sin it is the power of the desert god never gives a man a desire it can't journal to make grace a disgrace but it gives you a desire to present your body privilege it's a living sacrifice we understand in the old testament is but now when it comes to the new testament is bringing us into the news and he's saying that you need to be included into this when it comes is so when you come to the temple i look over there come into that area oh hallelujah if you want blood to speak you gotta bring therefore he's going to receive a sacrifice i love donkey vice you're his righteousness as your soul presents it could not be a lame sacrifice god didn't want a living sacrifice god didn't want it deformed jesus christ foreign bring is is that they could produce is [Applause] sacrifice this family would still leave there with the same desire jesus christ [Applause] just speak foreign [Music] not deuteronomy 15 19. the bible says all the firstly males and if they flock [Music] blemishes and he shall offer it of his own representative next word offered up his own representative to the [Applause] people [Applause] [Applause] that is an opportunity god can speak to you and change my life not just being conformed for me [Music] even when it comes to the temple itself the tabernacle you remember do you know that god goes into great detail on the kind of furniture that he wants inside that tabernacle [Applause] god had different [Applause] dude [Applause] is is is [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] oh is sacrifices [Applause] is [Applause] it's the people egypt god loves willingness willingness to please he's [Applause] [Applause] oh hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] i don't that's acceptable is it offering an offering [Applause] god's allowing them to give something next year it's good to a tribute to the spirit is [Applause] is [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] a preacher is but he sacrifices [Applause] oh together oh [Applause] [Applause] when you become born again every time [Applause] every time [Applause] you like that sacrifice from the old sacrifice watch this remark when that sacrifice is laid on that altar he's not lying there he's not moving italian he's foreign [Music] foreign is [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] can't he wants to accept it holy [Music] hallelujah you do hallelujah god heavenly father lord we've done our best to be able to be yielded today lord you see every hand in heaven
