years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why come the ground and then answer him said Lord let it alone this year so what year what was the year what was the year years and did find he wanted to cut he said they gave him the they said not this year so it was the fourth year and you already know that this you know W slay the Pentecostal you already know the preaching and he let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it and dunk it and if it also I cut it down Psalm chapter 1 is the man that W not in the Council of the ungodly no standing in the way of Sinners no sit in the seat of crulight is in the law of the Lord amen and his Lord meditate night and shall be like a tree planted Prophet say in French it's a little different by the rivers of waters that brings forth his fruits his Le also shall not wither and whatsoever he do have the ungodly are not so but like which the wind drives away let's pray the Lord Eternal Almighty you are the great God you the powerful one coming humbly in your presence we need your grace we are reading it's true we went to school but this word became life that will come from you Lord may you announce us you

that's why come andate your word may that change our life we filled with the Holy Spirit for your own glory in the name of Jesus amen amen may God bless you may he bless also the pastor uh I I got a little I took the decision if I come back here I'm not going to eat anymore every single time I come to United States there's always you know I'm getting weight I'm going to do my best I want to give it tributes to our brother Billy Paul oh yeah you may be seated I give a tribute to our brother Billy Paul we all were sad about his passing away I just want to make a little comments to make you laugh it's not we really thought that we were the especially us conges we have a lot of we have a lot of we have a lot of callings you're not going to see anybody as a white man or even though you PR they're not going to give that name but our we we had people called We Know oh we had we got our visa and we wanted to you know find our chickets oh we heard it's only the the family the the the near the close family they were allowed to go to the the burial but all of us we had n we had BR we had thein all of us we couldn't attend the burial they put us on the side when I went there I saw where they buried bil Paul and I saw a lot of things that when I went there in in front of the Tomb in front of the Tomb I also repeated those words from the prophet I also wanted to you know just for 5 minutes before going to the message it's in the message there are three it's in the it's m the great Prince and King was preached on Sunday you know January 9th 1955 the morning 181 I'm working with the translation of sometime you know voice of God another paragraph I don't have time to go and look I was reading sh if you have the voice of God God can also help you to find it in the morning I was looking where I wanted to read but for voice of God it was another paragraph we don't have time to verify all there is three element that a man follows in the mathematic of God all the numbers are perfect but the number three God is working more with that number because number three it's life the first day of creation God created light after God created Earth and the third day God brought a Botanical life and you saw there that's that was life the number seven it's the achievement eight is eternity but you cannot go to Eternity without life amen number three is life justification sanctification and the B of the Holy Ghost life there's only three movement that man can do you can go out you can go in and you can go up for us Christians for the unbelievers they can go out they can go in and they go down to the but we have we are going up heaven and the prophesied lot went out from Sodom and gorra no went to the ark and Enoch was raptured that's number three it's going to take us to the Rapture or we went all the C and we went to the word of God and it's going to bring us to Heaven amen you see you see now here brother said there are three elements that a man follows first is human second is divine revelation third is a vision is that said the Lord going to go deep otherwise we're going to take more time just remember this it's always going to follow us may it be the pastor may I be me we are all hum we have the Revelation all of that work with us follow I gave you the example someone he gave me the you know give it to anybody in the church I'm going to give it to my my son why are you going to think I'm you think I'm going to go and find another person I'm going to give it to my son it's human being you say Pastor I'm also human being I'm going to give that call to my son it's not going to be a problem it's normal why it's human I'm going to read another if you want to continue you can read it that's not what I'm looking fundamental fund the was preach on it was January 13th 1955 says this say remember human Revelation and the vision he told them to remember you know with all the if they bring me the board going help me I always like the and the prophet says we have Vision we have the human Revelation the vision we have three things one we have the human two we have the Revelation and three we have the that said the Lord the three things and the prophet continues in that message and he took onein 13 just uh you know talk about Billy Paul tribute giving my to yes 1 Corinthian 13 verse 13 bipo was born September 13th you know that he was born on the September 13 and now about these things faith hope charity but the greatest of this is Charity now in this message the fundamental Foundation of Faith the prophet says paragraph 1 he said remember last night the human the Revelation the vision now he says this is this is Hope The Human Side he said The Human Side this is hope this is this is Faith the Revelation that's Faith you know that right said ration the faith is revelation and that said the Lord that's charity now listen to what says I don't want to read everything you have you can have faith on on it can happen or not you can have Revelation what says you are if you keep the re once you lose your faith healing will also but said the Lord may you believe it believe it will happen it doesn't doesn't require your faith God and it's going to fulfill it he told that said the Lord that man will see and you know the and the see he says since that man said he lost his he came back brother I lost my everybody's talking and you still selling books paper you don't see why brother say you see why can't you see I lost my where oh no he said go am didn't say go when God say something God said it it's not going to change even though you he will be fulfilled yes sir amen and after that blind man recover his sight because it was that said the Lord amen with the revelation it can work or not if you read the the book uh Hebrews chapter 7 first part there's a family that left B Tabernacle the man and his family was coming there and the man was sick came home pray for the man and the woman say after three weeks the man died and that woman started talking better I'm not going to come to church your church how come I asking a question he said he's going to be here but my my husband is dead they sent deacons and then he talk bad about the and say just leave her alone after all she went to trouble and she had a lot of trouble because she was not well taught the Bible says you will you will you will put your hands on sick and they will beill that's the Revelation because God said in this B it's not all the sick people who going to be healed if said the Lord then it will happen amen now the prophet is going on he showed that the human is Hope and Faith that's Revelation is Faith and the is the charity now listen the story of my [Music] life you know it was on August 20th Sunday 50820 9 two children sick you also in the message you always leave us you also have to read you guys are us this is our life there are things that we cannot express all I want to be speaking but it's because you are not reading but you know all the story about your great grandfather you know where he's uh he's from you know him oh they this is also our story you have to know it you know when the flood came said how get to Columbus I was cut off and there walking down the street crying ringing my hands don't know what would would take take place run up to me he said Billy you looking for Hope is her first wife say aren't you I said yes that was my wife's name they used to call her hope me hope hope you know that's experence in French ah the he said me Faith now it's Faith he say him faith and he say and little baby little Billy charity now look we have a problem in French the was preaching English we have to be identified say number five it's faith it say faith has five letters it is true in English yes Jesus now look in French how many letters do we have in French three then we are out of the message because faith is but in French that for me to identify the message in my church look how we are reading Faith now we are adding two h's to to Faith to four in in French to make five because said five letters but in my church I added two H to make it five say Sir don't say thank now it's five for me you can say faith is five letters now brother says hope is the and the faith that's himself and charity it's bil charity is the one that lasts longer and B lasted longer age and hope went before and then Faith as well but charity continued and then to finish is also talking about this the powerful transformation of God august1 October 31 okay Parra 6 paragraph 6 6 now listen to brother B I had cast I was cast October 31st 65 no no no no no no let's start paragraph five I don't believe to know in one place in the Bible that I've never seen in the Bible in my life especially with this many people where there was so many nice Christians with this love amen amen don't never let that among you just remember we are in an evil age in the age where there's a lot of things happen and the people are not respecting this message people are playing with this message but the prophet said when you will see this message to lose something has to happen the things that we never heard before and we are hearing things worse than Pentecost in the name of the Prophet we have to keep love amen even if someone you still have to yes sir you have to go forward if someone talk B about say look for something good about this man even one things and talk about that good and forget about the and God will bless and you will grow EAS we have we are in a town where someone has to protect his heart your heart is not uh where they going to dump all the best things yes sir amen no sir especially today you know I think I thought about and I understood in this age and the reward it's because the reward of Hallelujah you will SE the Lord in his this is a difficult age now listen you can be with your phone yourself if you're not careful you will go to hell yes sir true yourself with your phone I don't know if was still alive will be talking about the phon today talk so much about television and I don't know what it will be because I don't have the capacity to take the TV and then put it on my back but with the that you have you have the whole world you have Casino in your phone you have football you have everything you have music you have everything with your with that small thing to overcome it today then you will be with the Lord amen in other words use your phone purely in a good way then you will be with the Lord amen yes sir that's true my brother amen what people were saying my wife's name was hope my first wife bil's mother they used to there was three of us then that was hope and myself and bil they used to call us amen and so seem to have a birly faith like in those days like in those days to believe that this word was true and what was God he will do amen now see the greatest of this is Charity yes sir that's the one that last long it's bil went 56 years hope in his 80 88 eternity now listen his love brother lepress this morning love there his Tong it shall we we are Beyond Pentecostals because the bring back the gift those are P but we have to go far from that Beyond it and we don't have to reject all that we're going to go a little fur but we going to take justification sanctification of and the return of and then we're going to uh bring the the if you want to go beyond P you're not going to go it's not going to work how are you going to jump It's like a stairs and I always say everywhere they preach this message there are the nine gifts amen I say it and I believe it amen there are nine gifts just pay close attention to that and you will see that coming but if you don't pay attention you're not going to see those why the holy spirit is very timid if you don't mention it's not going to come it's not going to force you but if you talk about if you talk about Jesus and Jesus if you don't talk about he's not going to come amen that's why point I'm saying everywhere Jesus is not welcome me as well I'm not welcome yes sir amen hallelujah paragraph 8 I think there is nothing greater than love amen and love we can't express it we can say that we have love we're just saying that but when we can really Express what we said that we have then we show it ourselves ourself now hallelujah we're not perfect people we make our mistakes yes sir we do things that's wrong but you see Love cover all of them yes sir amen we willing that's the mystery if you're looking for the Holy Ghost just the willing and God will give you the Holy Ghost yes sir and he continues he says when we see our mistakes to come back and apologize to one another Hallelujah yeah that's Warriors amen I never understood brothers who don't come and apolog I don't understand I even ask forgiveness to my children and brother taugh me says this if someone says you offended me don't justify yourself just say my brother forgive me yes sir and after you say what did I do my brother so that next time I'm not going to do the same mistake but if you say what did I do to offend you brother you don't understand then when someone come said say brother you say you too much you don't leave the sister alone this is a bad spirit said thank you brother he kned down he said pray for me and then that person because that was the devil speaking when down for that brother to pray and the brother said I'm my hands and then he ran away there are some stuff in our lives we are the one that willing to if you take the decision from tomorrow I'm not going to have problem with anybody it will work it will work amen that's Warriors amen that's really man and woman that's Gallant any man can go out to the battlefield that's got nerve enough to walk out there but when he gets knocked down then get up and try it again that's a good War you make a mistake you get up and you stop back amen sir you see with this one I wanted to give my tribut to because hope went many years Faith also went but charity lasted longer for years and years longer we're not going to have a long preaching I want to see the hours Mercy Pastor thank you Pastor okay we're going to start our preaching now here's uh the field we had the tree that was planted according to the story the owner three years first year no fruit second year no fruit the third year no fruit say oh you know I'm he say the one that was Tak care he said there's not he said just just take care you know this is for nothing ground this tree even it's a lord Jesus I'm not going to take even though it's a bright it's the about this of you and me yes so that we can be concerned today we cannot and talking to people who are very far when they said the BR Street tree and you are thinking about another tree you are forgetting that that tree is you are the Bri it's you that needs to but you are looking somewhere else and when you're going to go out oh they they talk about the instead of saying they talk about me and you're going to say they talk about the BR tree and you thinking about a tree and you don't even know what that tree is tree is you yes sir even though the proph Jesus after and he say it's the man it's you now we're going to start with this he said we're going to cut it and the vineard came he said the owner of this tree it's not theine it's the the the owner yeah he said the Lord he said give me another year I'm going to come with I'm going to I'm going to take things you know I'm going to dig it's your heart you're going to take God is taking things the way I'm preaching you and I'm preaching myself and when they don't see another things being dark somewhere and see the good confession that you're going deep into something of your heart not just one side he say around it it around the tree yes sir amen before going to the with the prophet let's go that three was three years and the one he said give me another year the fourth the year of the the day the sun came the fourth day the sun has to he said let me dig around the tree I want to put I want to put water to not go into detail about the first and the fourth fls and he talk about four fls he said pcal and US said we are the fourth flight that's where restoration that's where four is the Deliverance then listen what the prophet says I want to come back to it April 22nd 62 was Sunday we're going to talk about how we're going to restore the tree paragraph 108 but was planted not attached today we have a lot who are attached to the church instead of being planted to the Holy Ghost they attached to the church oh my they forgot God sent this message to find the bride yes sir and in all the churches there's a part ofr in every Church there three kind of belever don't be influenced by someone yes sir if it's not the word of God be be the when is be the word and the Holy Spirit yes why because you have to have one influence the influence of the word of God Beyond this one you don't have any other if you follow another influence you're going to be in trouble yes sir that's why don't be influenced isah by the king the day was he became he didn't know what to do I want to fill with the Holy Spirit and after and he didn't think about oah anymore you have to look for the BS of the Holy Spirit listen to The Prophet don't be attached you see like this brother here I mean like this this flowers you know they are just attached you can attach detach but we are planted we have Roots amen yes sir am wonderful yes sir the prophet continues don't be attached but plant it by the waters and you will find fruits listen is fruits in the just repeating paragraph 110 listen then he will bring fruit in this due season eat fruit yes sir it's a capital and brother is explaining it he's explaining it the fruits in English is 166 in english6 thank you thank you my brother you see babon is I like this P it really we really with all the spiritual all since we didn't have anything we couldn't verify what the preacher was saying but today as we're speaking as returning and we see this course now lie again if you lie you see you cannot lie anymore now listen to now he shall bring forth his fruit in his season not the sound of the ear but it's his yeah personal proun sayal there his fruits God's fruits in the season that the pro that's why a lot of people between and Jesus Christ they didn't understand he was the fruit of Jesus in the season yes sir it's not the fruit of it's the fruit ofes but if someone is looking no no no it's not his fruits it's the fruit of Jesus of God he said I was looking for the and I didn't find it's not the maker we was looking for it was the owner the boss itself the owner who was looking for the fruits you understood understand amen he said it's is fruit God's fruit in the season that the prophet is bringing it now give this year the year the fourth fls oh he Dig Dug that's the spirit of Mal you have to dig Elijah before he said to the I'm not going to touch it Elijah did the same thing when the prophet of were praying it was the same the they didn't have any but for them the fire didn't come because they didn't have formul how to bring down the fire they were praying and they didn't have form but when El the first thing he was oh I feel good religious he he said dig and 12 M down he said bring out V he said four oh first four times they came and they vers all the waters they pour all the waters four 12 he walk with 12 Stones and 12 sacrifices according to the 12 patri yes and Elisha two kings somewhere there when son of wanted to go to the he called jat with the the king of do he didn't know what to do then and Joseph said we can't go can can we consult the prophet don't do something without consulting God yes sir in this age God has With His prophets amen yes sir oh I understand you don't understand anything tell us what the prophet said yes sir amen and then suddenly and uh say what why what are you here for you why didn't you follow the god of your father the prophet of your father and Jezebel if it wasn't for I wanted to cast you out and I was very amazed brother say brother the prophet L was very and he couldn't even prophesy he said to calm down he said bring bring a child that's why the office of it's a great just don't sing because you have to sing you have to sing things word and we go deep in our heart am just don't sing like that like people are sleeping if you want to do something for amen do it as is your last time yes sir praise God Amen Elijah did the same thing he said dig and then you will find you know all they will be full but you will not understand where that because you will not see any any clouds many people are talking about it's simple what you are waiting for you will not all that you are looking for waiting for that's spect it's for the Jew for us it will happen simple the way God used brother Bram even the neighbors didn't even understand they didn't know it we

all the bres Luther wle Wesley said inside of it of that there's and the B to be open so that the wheat can come out you know with the effect of the Sun the prophet continues he say let's take Ephesians 5 uh verse five it says sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus what happened he said God by his for predestinated us unto the adoption of children of God by Jesus Christ amen by his for knowledge predestin everything that will happen right down by his for knowledge he for it therefore from beginning he could tell the end yes sir he was predestinated fruits in the roots of
