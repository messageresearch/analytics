your soul you go help let it Bubble Up come to you [Music] you want to uh preach to you what the Lord has put on our heart this morning while we have you standing let's all just bow our heads your gracious Heavenly Father Lord we come before you yet again this morning Lord please just stand here as an unworthy people but your blood has made us worthy look we're just so thankful that we have another opportunity to gather ourselves Lord we're just so thankful that we can gather ourselves together and that we can come with an expectation that you are going to meet us here we're not serving a dead God but we're serving a living God we're not serving a god of the past we're not serving a god of history but we're serving God of today Lord Lord we're just so thankful we're thankful for your mercies order forgiveness Lord that is new Every Morning Lord there's many needs amongst your people Lord I don't know the needs but you do or we just invite you down into this service this morning whatever Avenue you would have us to go down lord we just ask that you would have complete control Lord we just asked that you would walk the aisles of the church this morning we know we didn't gather ourselves together to hear from any man but we've gathered ourselves together to hear from the Throne of God we're coming with an expectation we ask this all in the name of Jesus Christ amen and if you have your scriptures we'll go ahead and just jump right into the the scriptures and then we'll have you seated who's all happy to be in the house of the Lord [Music] who came with a bad attitude no we all came with a good attitude amen amen if you would turn over in your scriptures Luke 23. we'll take a familiar scripture here verse 33 through 46. as I say many times we're not here to preach anything new we believe the seventh angel has already come we believe that that message has already sounded so I don't have the burden of preaching you the message I just repeat what he is amen amen Luke 23 33. and it says that when they were come to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and the male factors one on the right and the other on the left is then said Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiments and cast lots and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them to and derailed him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be Christ The Chosen of God and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be king of the Jews save thyself and a subscription also was written over him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew this is the king of the Jews and one of the male factors which were uh hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself and us [Music] but the other answering rebuked him said does not thou fear God seeing that thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive our due reward for our Deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto you today Thou shalt be with me in paradise and it was about the sixth hour and there was a Darkness over all the Earth until the ninth hour and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst it is and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I commit my spirit and having said this he gave up the ghosts amen you may be seated so if we could take a thought for this morning I was struggling with a title but if we could just title this for this morning's service what he said what Christ said it's a very important thing what Christ says you know there's many voices in the world today many worldly voices that are trying to pull you this way or pull you down but it really doesn't matter what the world says what matters is what God says the world may look at you they say that you're a sinner that you're not even educated that you'll never amount to anything but it doesn't matter what the world says about it but it just matters What God Says so in verse 33 the scriptures said There They Crucified him and brother Brandon breaks that down in a message and he says those four words he says there the most holy city the most holy people crucified the most horrible death the most holy person There They Crucified him Allah they asked Christ where did you get all those bruises and those cuts he said I got them in the house of my friends so when we're preaching this morning let's not point at other people so let's point it ourselves let's see what this message means to us and I want to pose to you a question so many times we have sayings in the message or even as just Christians where we say phrases and we say them but we don't really understand so many times we say that we are saved by the blood of Jesus Christ and I want you to think to yourself now what does the blood of Jesus Christ mean to me what does the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] Amen brother Patrick what does the blood of Jesus Christ just one word justification brother what does it mean to you okay salvation so many words that are all summed up in the blood of Jesus Christ let's see what brother random has to say about it in the message Angel of the Lord 51. Brother Branham says he says yes the blood of Jesus Christ won't only Clean Hands many of us have dirty hands please the scripture says even our righteousness is as filthy rags and think to yourself what does the blood of Jesus Christ mean to me he says the blood of Jesus Christ won't only Clean Hands I don't care where you came from Jesus Christ he has taken the old person that you want to learn and he has totally changed your entire life you don't see things the same way you don't do the same things why because it's not something that we've done but it is the blood of Jesus Christ that changes yourself you can bury those little things because they are dead Satan sure likes to keep track of all those things that you've done wrong he tries doing CPR on that old man he tries to get that shocker machine clear clear clear let's keep Reviving this old man but the blood of Jesus Christ has made you know let's imagine you had a million dollar debt image and someone comes to your old house that you used to live in you've sold it you're living in a new place and the Creditor comes to that old house Alberto hello hello person answers well yeah I'm with the bank you owe me a million dollars the person in the house he goes nope I have your address right here isn't there such and such an address said yeah you owe me a million dollars the person that owed you that million dollars he doesn't live here anymore [Applause] that old debt is not associated with me that's associated with somebody else and sometimes that's what we have to tell the devil is no longer associated with me the house body may look the same but the person that's a totally different person that old person has passed away through the blood of Jesus Christ gets deep let's go back to the quote it makes the vilest sinner a new person Hallelujah that ought to make a Methodist and we aren't even methodists what should it do to a message purifying cleansed by the Holy Spirit give them their inheritance an inheritance that they last a lot that they lost Long Ago by the fall down let me tell you something churches this inheritance is rightfully yours it was yours before the foundation of the world and it was lost and given to the wrong hands that's right amen if you have a house and you take out the million dollar mortgage the title goes to the bank they are not the rightful owners refuse to redeem it [Applause] says the house is rightfully yours how long is the prices so when Jesus Christ shed his blood [Applause] the price had been rightfully paid and the asset of your salvation the asset of your healing rightfully yours it put them in a relationship with God to become sons and daughters that's enough to stir the heart of anybody and look at what what brother Branham ties right in here paragraph 28 he says just as sure not maybe so not this is kind of wishy-washy potatoes this is I have faith not hope just as sure as Jesus rose from the grave so we have received new life we have received eternal life so it doesn't matter if we go by way of the Grave six feet of dirt can't hold me down but some of us and I believe that I'm looking at a group it's going to realize who they are that they are the Bride of Jesus Christ they are going to have rapturing faith that is going to change their mortal bodies the Seven Seals have been revealed the seventh age messenger has come the Lord is coming mission accomplished there's gonna be somebody that's gonna fulfill the Rapture scriptures why not me why can't we just say that'll be me we're not looking to be Noah we're looking to be Enoch yeah but the Bible says that blood can speak if we look at Genesis 4 and verse 9. the scripture says and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I have no idea am I the one that's supposed to keep tabs on him and he said what has thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground think about it Abel's blood was crying out against it was crying out condemnation against Kings because Cain had shed innocent blood Abel had a revelation that it was blood that was going to cleanse him from him and in the Old Testament they took a innocent lamb hello and they would shed the blood of the innocent lamb and it would cover the sins of the of the the believer and they would do it year after year because their sins could only be covered but when the the lamb comes and when the blood of the Lamb is shame it doesn't just cover sins but it completely annihilately no no reason to cover because the sins not New York amen and then that scripture is fulfilled over in in Hebrews 12 24. and Paul says he says and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel amen hallelujah so Jesus is blood I don't understand doesn't speak of condemnation Jesus says science may say that blood can't talk blood can't speak but I tell you what there's an element found in blood it's called your DNA and that DNA says foreign yeah that's right and Satan may try to condemn you and all of a sudden person and he might say all of this blood is on your hands you're an adulterer you're a liar you're a cheater you're good for nothing he uses all those things to bound you down he'll try to bound you down with suicide in all of these things because that blood is speaking condemnation but the blood of Jesus it speaks greater things and he had a message come to identify that DNA hello [Applause] you're not one of them you're one of mines [Music] speaks of who you really are praise the Lord that's what he's saying yeah brother Branham says in the message token 63. starting with paragraph 352. he says and went and when you and the word become one we could spend lots of time on breaking this down but we're just hitting the highlights but for those of you taking notes listen to the tokenya the one I I uh listened to was in 63 I think he preaches it three times he also preaches one called the sin of unbelief and you can clean a lot from those but when you and the word become one every promise I think you all need to read that with me when you and the word become one every promise not some promises every promise is yours it obeys you amen amen I my heart's wanting to like jump out of me right now do we realize what this message is God had sent a scripture but we didn't understand what it was telling us we didn't know how to decode the DNA all we saw was Crimson blood but when it starts speaking to you but the blood of Jesus Christ start speaking to you then becomes and it says every promise then you want to watch what you want to do you want to watch what you want to do you wouldn't put your hand in a fire and just say see me do it but if there's something in that fight I gotta reach for it and it'll obey me listen we're talking about sons and daughters Sons and Daughters of God the creator of Heaven the creator of that fire so if you have a need and you need to reach into that I don't know if you're reach into the fire and not be burned no that's impossible well I've got a brother John hello Jefferson they tried to burn him it didn't work because there was something for him to do they tried putting him in a Boiling Pot they're gonna have chicken noodles and John but it didn't work because there was something for John to do when God has something for you to do well how do I know that God's got something for me you woke up this morning didn't you you woke up this morning you have breath in your lungs your heart's pumping right and there's something for you to do we don't just come to church and sit on these these seats but we are coming for a reason amen God has something for you in your life you gotta search it out and the scripture says that the path of a righteous man is ordered of the law all you have to do is be surrendered to God take it step by step up and fulfill What the Lord Has yeah and when God gives you a commission it doesn't matter if there's a Boiling Pot in the way it doesn't matter if there's a Red Sea in there a whale in your way you could be in the belly of a whale [Applause] because you are a son and daughter of God [Music] not limited to Five Senses but you are son and daughter of God [Applause] we just let the devil tell us what to do we're living so far underneath our privilege we should have a great faith we had this message what do we have to be afraid it'll obey me see that's right you want to watch what you are doing I'll tell you one thing sometimes you think nobody's watching but foreign he's got all these things that that you've done wrong sometimes he's like oh my fingers are getting tired today is and you think nobody's watching itself paragraph 353. that's the reason Holy Spirit sparingly give out you know what I mean sometimes God doesn't give us the power because we don't know how to use it that's the reason the Holy Spirit sparingly gives out in things you don't want to he's searching for a way to say this a real servant of God don't show off everything right brother random had a gift of healing my vehicle thousands and thousands of people yes sir I've met many many people that have been in brother branham's meetings healings thing after thing after thing but brother Brandon would get sick he didn't do anything about it because the gift wasn't for him the gift was for the price [Music] he didn't put on the gold bracelets those gifts weren't for him but those gifts were to attract the bride [Applause] you won't show off with it but then another time comes and there's a little girl that's about ready to die and brother Branham looks up to the ceiling fan there's two chains hanging down they came to a life and death situation if you believe that I can move will you have faith that God can heal you and then that chain starts whirling around like this and moving and it scared the little girl she said was God moving that or was Satan moving now hello it was my faith he had to show her that Faith was real the power of a son and daughter of God you can recognize who you really are amen that gets deep let's move on 355 plus no single thing Paul tells us that blood speaks anyone knows that blood is actually itself can't speak it's a chemistry is that right how many knows but how many knows that blood speaks if you want to put that down Genesis 4 10 we read it God said what about your brother he said his blood cries out from the earth against you his blood is speaking Hallelujah God said what about him he said am I My Brother's Keeper and his blood crying out the blood is a token it's a token that he had been killed his blood was crying out against him now if you get that in Genesis 4 10. then in Hebrews 12 and 24 start reading the blood of Jesus speaketh greater or better things than not available he was a righteous man he died innocent because he was in the way he was in the way standing for a real Revelation he spoke it cried out the Justice blood of Abel cried out again but the blood of Jesus Christ that house has been redeemed this is yours the blood of Jesus Christ is a token I was listening to it this morning [Applause] it's more powerful than you can imagine amen skip down to 361. it's crying out you see the blood of Jesus Christ cries out but there is forgiveness in it if you'll just accept it he says I wish I could spend a little while on that blood speaketh a better thing believe for safety security then apply it here's what you want to believe foreign claim it oh but I thought I had to shout the whole house down oh I thought I had to burn 15 candles there's a preacher in the message he used to be Catholic and the Lord starts dealing with him well he didn't know what it was he goes to the Catholic church and burns every single candle they had in the church the next service the priest he's like who burnt like a hundred thousand dollars worth of candles but he didn't feel a change because it's not what we do on the outside but the blood of Jesus Christ changes what's on the end and then it'll manifest if you take a seat and you plant it in the ground and you water it the next day you come back out and you dig it up nothing's happened and you cover it back up and you come back next week [Music] nothing happens but if you let that seed sit there and you let it ripen in the presence of the Son of God then it will begin to grow see many young people go to youth camp I know what it's like to be at the Louisiana campus I know what it's like to be in the prayer line I was in the prayer line when that little girl came through with her hair all gone that little Pruitt girl went through there I thought she had cancer or something she didn't have any hair but she had uh hair clips in her hand because she had faith that her hair was coming back because the scripture says you see now tell me God ain't real Hello that's what doctor said was an incurable disease but the blood purchased it for her way back 2 000 years ago all she had to do was accept him you would say God at her at his words see this message is simple this is not a complicated gospel complicated but you know what we can do we can trust in What God Says [Music] Jesus's blood re-wrote history you can't rewrite history well the blood of Jesus Christ because all those old things aren't mine dude says who writes history is it the losing side of the battle no it's the victors that read that write the history right amen World War II this is yes there were battles there were times when it looked like we weren't gonna win yeah and guess what we're gonna stay in power forever the Nazis the Nazis wrote the history books right but they did it because the victors write the history so when Jesus Christ is up there on the cross and he becomes the victor of your history [Music] there's a story brother Brandon tells us he talks about Daniel Greenfield Greenfield brother Daniel Greenfield he was a great evangelist great preacher Daniel Greenfield he dies and goes to heaven and he gets up there there's somebody who greets him at the Pearly Gates and they say what is your name sir says I'm Reverend Daniel Greenfield Greenfield from America they say okay well let me see your name is [Music] surely my name is I've done all this work for God is there anything that I can do get the shoes could you prefer and he said well you can appeal it in the uh in the court of God says I don't have a choice I must do it so he goes into the to the presence of God just whirling past Everything feels like he shot past the moon and the stars and was moving very fast and then all of a sudden he slows down and there's light coming from all over [Music] and Jesus is there and God's sitting on the throne and God says who approaches my Throne says I'm from America many years and God says I require Perfection Daniel Greenfield were you uh perfect Danielle Greenfield and he said I thought I was a pretty good A preacher a Christian but he said in the presence of that he had condemnation he said no Lord I I was not perfect as well Daniel Greenfield have you ever lied and he thought I thought I was a pretty honest man but in the presence I Shady business deals who's just exactly right and he goes through this whole list of things Daniel Greenfield thought he was okay Danielle greenford Greenfield possibility he thought that's because I'm a preacher I'm okay sometimes we think because we're message Believers we're okay because we're coming to church so we're okay just because Mama and Daddy are message Believers we're okay he said well you did yeah if that's the case can you imagine a Sinking Feeling I've been in court one time and you know you wouldn't think that it would take such an emotional hold but when the judge calls you out by name it gets your attention Things become serious he says you have no room in heaven for just about that time the sweetest words you ever did sweeter words than your mother could say hold on Daniel Greenfield may have been a a sinner Daniel Greenfield temperature Jesus says while on Earth he stood there representing me that is when the jury can use that document [Music] if he does and Satan would love to submit your documents and he says hold on I know Jesus is on his side but he would that no one would perisha I have a document and it should become a legal documents you should go into the files of Heaven says the judge says well let's see your documents and he submits the document and they scan it in nowadays to where they have it on a screen it means and it comes up and God says is this the document you wish to admit he says yes Jesus looks at it thank you [Applause] [Music] therefore it cannot be used as evidence and that cannot sway the jury if the blood of Jesus Christ wasn't powerful enough that it couldn't loose the seals then every soul in the book would be lost [Music] doesn't matter Paul brother all our names are in that book well as long as that book is sealed we're all lost but the blood of Jesus Christ had the purchasing power in Revelations chapter five starting with verse John saw this and he said and I saw the right hand of him that sat on the throne book written within on the back side sealed with seven seas and a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy who is Worthy come on and John says I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David that prevailed to open them up amen without the blood of Jesus he would not have the purchasing powers to where we can make manifests because of the blood if you can read the whole chapter the blood of Jesus Christ had the purchasing power to lose the seals so I'll have to to leave that there because that's getting into my Wednesday message but he Satan is always trying to take the Book of Revelations and make it not the Book of Revelations and he wants to rename it the book of mysteries but it's not the book of mysteries it's called The Book of Revelation because God knew that in this age all the mysteries of God will be finished [Applause] we're not serving a dead dog we're not serving a God full of mysteries we're not serving a God that we don't know if he's one or if he's three or if he's two but we are serving the God he knows what he is thank you he's in a prophet he laid dead on the prophet to tell you who he is to reveal the 17th to reveal all the Mysteries to give you the Book of Revelation and make it Revelation you didn't want to give you the book of mysteries go to the library and check out the fictional books for that mystery books but that's not what we want in church what we want in church because then you can feel the stimulation [Applause] not stimulation by Mysteries but that's what the denominations are trying to get out they're trying to get you stimulated by Mysteries and a stimulation by mystery it's scary watch a mystery movie oh trying to solve this murder case oh it's all scary but the stimulation of Revelation is joy peace are you with me where is the Lord the purchasing power Jesus Christ has won [Music] he has the purchasing power we are free [Applause] we had Supernatural ears this morning I believe you could hear down in hell yes the devils are going guys we gotta learn something about these guys [Music] we have studied this church it was a thousand years I mean we we introduced the Catholic church so early in all the denominations we thought we could get them just a little bit off because that's all he's looking for is just a little bit off but these people are just different messages what is different about these people they're not duped by the the Trinity [Music] why can't we get on by the trinity foreign and we can trap them put them in Chains I'm shiny and when you're in Chains you can't do anything you're just LED around by whoever is leaving so when you're feeling depressed here's the thing about the devil of depression he doesn't even try to hide himself and he likes company so you see all these young people especially you go around so depressed everybody to know that they're depressed but they try to hide it so they find another friend that's also struggling with depression oh my life is just so horrible oh my feet and this and that and my parents don't get them out they love the other siblings more is that my boy this is school and that was and he'll put a weight on you that feels like physical changes and when you're down and depressed how are you gonna have faith for deliverance you see it's a a trick um yeah but as that song goes I love it so much the song says don't be bound by Broken chains [Music] because those chains are broken Jesus Christ already you're sitting there all depressed thinking you're bad you can't be bound by Broken Dreams [Applause] Shake It Off like Paul did your logs on the fire comes out and latches on his hands and he didn't say oh my God I'm going to die he knew he was the son of God [Applause] he was born no arms no legs maybe some of you have seen him he just Waddles around he's a great preacher he has a little like skin that he calls a foot remember in Jamba but he had a great Revelation in this he said I might not have any arms I may not have any language but do you know why God gave me a foot because at the bottom of my foot belongs Satan belongs at the bottom of our feet our heel is going to bruise God Gave You feet to stop on the devil God Gave You hands to raise to the Lord and praise him [Applause] but our names are on the book so now we can be honored like Mordecai event over an hour already so I'll try to wrap this up here pretty quickly still not as long as brother foston but in the book of Mordecai we can read about Mordecai he had done works that seems to be overlooked but pretty soon that that King has a restless night he can't sleep [Music] election go get my book of remembrance I want to read on the book of remembrance so they go and they get the book of uh and they bring it to the king and he says read me a job and he starts reading about a great story how there was a plot against the king oh yeah and they were going to kill him but there was a servant named he found out that the the devils and he saved the king the King goes that was a good story what has been done to this morning he should be honored [Music] as that was happening in the seventh Church age the devil was conspiring his own plan about the same person and he said Let It Be written I want to hang them seven stories high [Music] I want the world to know that Mordecai cannot be greater than me he doesn't bow when I come around I try to tempt him with all of these things you know what you know what I'm gonna go right now to the king and I'm in an accused accuse Mordecai to the king it's still really really early in the morning so he comes walking through the the court while the the king is thinking about that problem and he says who's in the courtroom that's my right hand man bring him in bring him in so Heyman comes in and he says I want to honor somebody Dio self-centered oh yeah who could the king want to honor yes he says well what should we what should we do to somebody that the king wants to honor he didn't even tell him what the Act was that he wants to honor them for you number remember [Music] well we should make a grand parade we should have the entire city we'll Rob him with the King's Road let's crown him with the king's crowns let's let him ride on the king's horse here's a Special Touch let's have a messenger go out in front of him saying thus shall it be done to the one that the king wants he's just digging his own game sometimes we do that too though foreign he says that's a that's a perfect idea I knew I could count on you you know what I want you to do that oversee it and I want you personally to walk that horse around because there's a young man his name is can you imagine Heyman his voice box went from here down here because the king want a daughter because in the book of remembrance of course name was written it didn't matter what Haman had in his mind was what God had in his mind so we'll wrap this up and try to bring it to a close if the musicians want to come go ahead it's one preachers if the musicians want to come to give the people hope we look at the thief on the cross and he was hanging there with Jesus and there's somebody across the aisle that says what about the bridge what about this what about that the message believer said do you not fear God listen he didn't even have time to get baptized he hadn't been a message believer for 40 years he didn't know all the things about the church that he was supposed to know all the right things to say but all that he didn't know how to say was Lord remember me but Jesus Christ was taking on his sins he was able to recognize the power of the blood and what did Jesus say he said today you will be with me I can imagine as the thief gets to the Pearly Gates they say uh what's your name I want to see if I can find you in our our registry is mine may not be on that book I may be a thief but all I know is he said that I could be here it doesn't matter that I'm a thief [Applause] there was a woman washing Jesus's feet [Music] she wasn't invited to the party Jesus was invited but not welcome and she's down there washing his feet and all the Pharisees say she's not she she can't be here and maybe she looked up and said I may not be welcome amen doesn't matter what you're going through but God said that you could be here [Music] the Bride of Jesus Christ part of the raptured group you might not be the best message believer maybe you just became a Christian it doesn't matter because all that God said is you could be here so what does the blood mean to you don't take it for granted do not take the blood of Jesus Christ because it's by the blood you are cleansed all you have to do is claim it so back to the question what does the blood of Jesus Christ all the Revelation that's in this book was purchased by the blood your every promise was purchased by the blood how we ought to be thankful how we ought to be a happy people because everything that you have needed has already been purchased and all you have to do is reach out and clean I can only preach as hard as I I know how to preach I can only say the words that I know how to sing but it's Gotta Be You that catches the revelations and that Rapture is coming soon so what about you if you haven't already come to Christ now's your time the Rapture is coming soon we don't have much longer around in the world and see that but in it s powerheads if anybody has a need a sickness [Music] you struggle even with just Reach Out And Touch the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] but that blood is more powerful today than it ever made it if Jesus's literal blood was here this morning if I had a jar of Jesus's literal blood and I was to anoint you with that word no more for you now then what you can do with it by reaching out and touching the Lord I'll invite you to pray with me pray however you want standing up sitting down [Music] in your mind and he's saying it out loud it doesn't matter but Reach Out And Touch the Lord it doesn't matter what's going on in your family it doesn't matter the financial struggles it doesn't matter what's going on in the church right now what matters is you reach out and touch the Lord his blood will cover you so so you are Sons and Daughters of God pray with me dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just come before you yet again Lord we're just so thankful for the blood of Jesus it has purchased our Salvation it's broken the Seven Seals Wide Open Lord it's delivered to us Revelation Lord not that we can just say that we know something or we're educated but Lord they are broken to give us rapturing Lord that we might manifest that our names are on the books help us to manifest that our names are on the book whatever the needs are amongst your people this morning touch each and every one more I can only do what I can do Lord this has all been broken up in pieces but Lord I just ask that you would deal with the people that you would have your perfect will a perfect way in every situation whatever their need is I just asked that you would just take them in your hands we just thank you for your presence we could be at many places but Lord we're just thankful to be in the presence Lord we know in your presence no Darkness we know in your presence we know in your presence it we know in your presence there is Victory we know in your presence there is freedom or to help us reach out and grab hold of it oh and just like Jacob did oh come on let us not let go let us take hold of the promises of God help us to claim them take a step toward us we just thank you for all that you've done in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] if anybody [Music] oh I am I repeat [Music] yes [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] there we go
