as we will be going from this place in new zealand please remember by the dream god in our prayers amen amen so tonight it's a prayer meeting you know the year we have been uh going through necessary on the preparation for the rapture you know someone turned it through the preparation and uh we know that we cannot go into the rapture without the baptism of the holy ghost and uh that's what we want to pray tonight brother we can pray for money all the things natural things twitter shows on the show's natural health god can give it to you you probably donate you can have millions of dollars what are we going to do with it tomorrow yamaha you are going to die and it's going to stay maybe somebody will never work for oh it's good for people to inherit say bianco but now for you nobody will go with nothing a person anybody rather that's why to have a vision to invest for god's kingdom and to pray for the kingdom that's the best prayers you can have a job tomorrow lose it you can have children tomorrow trouble you can have a wife a husband tomorrow troubles but the baptism for the holy ghost nearly by them do sentence pray is your ticket to heaven [Music] and that's my title tonight this is the holy ghost is your ticket to heaven listen to [Music] because the holy ghost is a promise the paschal sentence spiritual promise let us let take a look chapter 11 cannot look chapter ones from verse nine verse enough and uh brother sister tonight afghanistan just to focus on one thing because some travis you're in shows make sure the baptism on the holy ghost is your priorities [Music] and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone that asked receive it and he that the seekers findeth and to him that knock it it shall be open if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent okay le pere don't or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion oh oc demand another louis donaire and scorpion if he then being evil know how to give good gift unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him i was unfounded may the lord add blessings to the reading of the scriptures and we have to think that us evil that we are you know the vampire secret no no we know how to give you may be seated we know how to give good things to our children come on donate the bone shows and us and if we ask for the baptism of the holy ghost you know demand only by them do something for you god promise he is going to give it to you upon me and tonight that's what we are here for isis so the baptism of the holy ghost never turned the sentence free is the main thing that we need for our journey of voyage and brother bonham said in the message what is the holy ghost probably on the message question spring because there is we said that the holy ghost that's convicted the sentence praying is the wedding robe e la hope de is our uniform another uniform is the thing that will allow us to enter into the wedding supper amen amen because in there everybody will be dressed alike pascal tulmon and the holy ghost is our white hope is free and not blanche and the brother brahman said in the message what is the holy ghost on the message security sentence 27. said he said now there is a vast difference between just a christian and a holy ghost field christian a yeah but we'll never receive the baptism of the holy ghost that's the difference he says a christian somebody who claimed to be a christian is it different from somebody who have received the baptism of the holy ghost and tonight you are here to make the difference um with the rest of the so-called christians and now we are going to get this from the scripture and place it just exactly in the scriptures the first place there is a ian christian profess to be a christian professor but if this christian has not yet been filled with the holy ghost message completely sentenced me he is only in the process of being a christian he is professed to believe it confess he is working to it yeah martial of versailles so there may be people tonight who are working to it better today and this is an opportunity you are seeing opportunity but god has not yet given him his this spirit of the holy ghost is praying he has not yet reached that goal with god my inner pancreatic disease affect you that god recognize so the baptism of the holy ghost the time the sentence pray is a seal satan's soul oh that god has accepted you amen amen so in the message the things that ought to be drafted paragraph 107. did you have a reservation well i'm i'm sorry oh this julie everything is filled up the two way home play so when you go to that wedding supper hey can we lay down the holy ghost is your reservation the reservation is made by the holy spirit the reservation without the holy spirit suddenly sentence there is no reservation it's like you go to a hotel home second hotel they tell you this it's booked he cannot say sorry everything is filled up a two-way home please you are out in the cold was that lad on the floor because you failed to make reservations and if you come to the end of your life journey yes without reservations there will be no one there to meet you in your person you will have to step off into the dark eternity you because you haven't got a reservation basketball have your party reserved you must have them to enter the city where jesus has gone to prepare a place for you remember you must have the reservation and the government of salvation on the salud ideally sent the spring it may not come in classical places on paper they need understand what classical it may not come through great denominations it may not come through well-trained and polished preachers some people say but it's a pardon it is salvation that freedom from sin uh liberty it's a ticket to heaven said the baptism of the holy ghost and the spring is a ticket to heaven you say antiques it's also healing for the sick they say we'll see la guerrez on paulo mallard to those who will receive it as a pardon amen amen so brother branham continues in the message what is the holy ghost okay listen to me he said on paragraph 22 idiographer vendor upon this place that's your second word we wish to approach the subject which i think is the outstanding subject the reason i have taken this subject in a line like this comes to see because the brother on the holy ghost is he said the reason i have taken this subject in line like this you see because number one you cannot come and receive the holy ghost of the holy spirit unless you know what it is and you cannot receive it if you know what it is i could say unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you if you know what it is yes and you know it was you cannot know whether you have got it or not [Music] unless you know what results it brings up amen amen sometimes we have a doubt i do have it i don't number four yes but look at you have to know what does what the holy spirit does when it comes to work so if you know what it is and what action it brings when it comes then you will know what you have got when you get it that just would settle it and in the message what is the holy ghost given foreign one more scripture i'll call him if you want to write it down like here john 12 24. john dusovan let me cut it to you right quick rapid more jesus said if a corn of wheat falls into the ground except he dies he cannot bring forth another life now look at one closing remark now it's absolutely essential absolument that you receive the holy ghost now for if you don't you can't come in the resurrection so the baptism of the holy ghost hello but i'm the center spring it's not something to play with because sometimes we are looking for the baptism of the holy spirit only by them the center is praying and we don't know how to get into a new servant i don't have time tonight to go through certain things that the people who are looking for the baptism of the holy ghost the secular shall about them do you sent us pray they have to go meet with people who have the baptism of the holy i am looking for the baptism of the holy ghost but somehow i realized it's not yet it's in a pan call what else shall i do my quadrature what else shall i do what daughter the fresh faith and as you go into conversation a conversation sometimes you realize that oh it's because of these things i'm lacking to do yes they say that's why i'm delaying the baptism of the holy spirit therefore i have to do something this is to say tonight about the sisters specifically for sir we have to advise you the wrong advantage as brother branham said comfort it is absolutely absolute essential and necessary necessary and compelling obligatory and compulsory if ramon in existence that you receive the holy ghost now for if you don't but now means tonight and if you don't receive you can't come in the resurrection resurrection so the baptism of the holy ghost to the bottom of the sentence free is your ticket for heaven i'm not saying prayers oh god i pray to give me the holy ghost you have a promise the holy ghost you are promising look at what i have done regardless of your faith according to what you have a promise and you show god what god has a promise sacred you have for me and you said god he said we did it you have to repent and you start showing god your repentance are you with me it's not just a recital prayers but a prayer where you mention god's promise to you you tell him you said if i i repent and i get baptized hey joshua tj you will give me giveaway and you show him your baptisms and you show him your repentance he used to demonstrate totally pantones maybe the day you went into the world of baptisms that's not the day you completely repented yes you did some good repentance no question by yourself depending on your own level of sincerity the pandemonium divorce and say what sincerity but brother sister even if we become from getting the baptism and that's the reason why we come to church we listen to the sermon sometimes we despise what we hear that's where i start my work of the baptism of the holy spirit there is something that needs to be done and the god is still visiting people do you continue to visit and the god is still baptizing my burden is to see some testimony of people getting to that experience you know people came to the prayer lines had a lot of discernment to listen to this quote it was in the message i seen the brother bosworth he was praying for a little boy or a young man that and he's prayed for a little boy with one eye that's blind elaborate on a that's the father sitting next to the boy so brother there is something wrong with either a child or a grandchild [Music] it's a little girl or something it's born a of something but also the spiritual needs of spirit if he was here later you see the same god was with brother branham the father is the seeking the baptism of the holy ghost the perishable time the sentence pray if you are in that condition see what's that downside condition god knows with your name and branham said he has got some troubles to give up some habits [Music] and god is revealing to us that there are certain habits okay yes certainty brother you know if i would survive sister you know some of the habits certainly that if you don't get rid of okay i say power god will never give you the baptism because brother said there is an inspector yeah an inspector before he can seal vancouver he has to inspect it and he has to look at some of the old habits you say today it's over no some you say today it's over but some mess up you don't want to say that you still find like it's not a problem i know it's wrong to a certain extent when i get into conscientious i like it it's a habit satan with such habits as i can tell about the inspector inspector cannot be pleased the paper is satisfied you have to decide you would have this day that today it's forever say and brandon said he has got some troubles not only that pastel mercedes but that father was in the meeting with a boy who was uh one eye basket maybe a girl who was a creeper if you give up some of the habits he was abandoned god will give you the baptism for the holy ghost the sentence praying not only the baptism of the holy ghost and he's gonna heal also your daughter who is the creeper they don't allow healings in san diego lagerizon of our family members they don't member the family or for ourselves the number those habits they say between can be the cause for the failure even of the church [Music] those habits this is attitude can you prevent yourself from perv to have the baptism of the holy ghost while you attempt to understand so as we want to go to prayers we are not going to pray in the air now no we are going to take our habits into prayers some of the habits satan's attitude it's because of the environment you go in motherland or the circumstance you find yourself in lucio constance some of those habits [Music] are preventing you from receiving the baptism of the holy ghost talking about pharaoh when he wanted to go with the children of israel israel of moses when he wanted to go with the children of israel he is a convoluted part of elizabeth want him to compromise yes now i will let you go man but before he let them go not just one single day of prayer but you have to be persistent lord you know this habits even if tomorrow you fall memphis because you have a determination in determination you will come back forgive me send your pardon and i'm gonna attack that habit and the day that the habit will leave you but man i'm gonna keep certain things measure vega are they certain shows that's what banham said zone from there you leave some of your cattle back there you see people want to compromise but when we want a deliverance i'm not going to say i'm going to leave a certain habitat that's the way the devil wants a christian to come second circle to come with some compromise and he will tell you it will be all right for you to join the church but don't you never forgive john's many pardons that's one of the habits such a land is attitude never to forgive me and if you don't a civil pardon that habit to say between will never get you to the baptism of the holy spirit by you you don't have to give up your smoking maybe from your youth age you grew up in a house with a parent smokers drinking and you inherit those habits to oh it's a beer without alcohol oh no no alcoholism but when you drink vegan food you smell the bird wise until budweiser we need a total deliverance i don't want to have nothing to do even with the taste of the house to it for the sake to receive the baptism of the holy ghost of world center spring in another habit lying in the mountains but sometimes you can tell me that i'm a good barcelona monty sometimes they lied to the pastor pastor stealing you still in many ways you are late at work [Music] you still at work [Music] brother with that habit of accessibility you cannot go anywhere because that will put you in a position to think you are better than the others position the point of that blue mayo closet that one does this salucy he's no good in a pub that one does this he's not good in a problem and you bring certain habits even into the church he was about himself that's how you find the certain people in the church of a certain personality they never encourage nobody encouraged person go today somebody eleven a person oh brother martin oh you interpreted today very well god bless you because of venice but some people they never said it might be something personally this german the day he will interpret bad jokes you didn't sleep well that's what the brother pronoun is talking about faulty findings

father god the spiritual things lord made visible father understanding lord father god that he approached father because of father god just before in luke 10 or father god i was so fat i got taken away by busy many things but you said unto her oh one thing though father god is essential father to show us what to ask [Music] [Music] the prophet says it requires those people father shows who will desire lord father god to stay there until they have received it gracious redeemer understanding no father god the approach [Music] go back to the pattern and the powder and low fat show us slaughter to come through repentance lord by this new and living way father he said well father god they just shall live by faith where lord jesus christ lord that jesus suffered without the gate father where father god the church how to be sanctified where the church how to understand the things that low father got hold of backlord from receiving the promised father because the promise was given unto them to the children and to as many as the lord our god shall cause lord understanding lord jesus christ the evolution of the promised evolution that i promised into the power and father oh jesus christ lord jesus christ where we see lord father god the christ revealed in his own church throughout in our earthly journey we have seen the father god the spirit moving lord father god throughout the earth taking love for the god from the god and lo father god bringing him lord father god into the heavenly places in christ jesus christ here we stand lord surrounded by by a cloud of witnesses [Music] you have done it for them before you shall do it for us today precious redeemer god we looking low father god not to the visible things father because what we see as experience of other we made father god the invisible things lord father god you made the promise and lord jesus christ there in john 14. well father god you say when this holy spirit shall come shall teach you all things bring all things to your remembrance and show us things to come forward as the prophet would show father god this same holy spirit came to paul and lord showed him not only the things that were passed [Music] where the men could burst into the holy spirit [Music] and said that the lord shall judge the world by my gospel and whereby he says to the galatians that if any angel comes from heaven with another gospel lord let it be lord father and the things that does when the holy spirit comes no father got into a man in humility in simplicity because lord you hide and reveal yourself in simplicity that's why you say be perfectly as your father in heaven is perfect we don't want to be seen we do we don't want to be heard because upon the mountain lord there was no moses there was no elijah who's jesus alone that's the greatest revelation of all time [Music] but it was the bride in the end-time father accessing the revelation of jesus christ to see god in this program and station of it in our lives who could do this by the holy spirit that's why we desire it that's why i love father god we come to father we lay aside anything that be easily be satisfied father we're standing and we're looking father god away unto you because you say that the e flow for the evil that you give to your children the things that they desire [Music] the widow had cried to the unjust judges father [Music] [Music] the landmark of the land misplacing misquoting and misinterpreting it further [Music] but lord after the days of moses came down in joshua 5 14 father and we that's what we want to see moving in our hearts that's what that's what we want to see moving into our church because even the promise in the in the land you say [Music] [Music] that we can look back and say and the lord was in such a place to heal the people you're the angel of the lord who follows the prophet's message for deliverance [Music] in the physical place as we ask and pray in jesus christ's name amen amen amen [Music] may god bless you get your business please [Music] oh [Music] hey [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] uh breathe [Music] baby [Music] ah [Music] oh two wavelength [Music] you
