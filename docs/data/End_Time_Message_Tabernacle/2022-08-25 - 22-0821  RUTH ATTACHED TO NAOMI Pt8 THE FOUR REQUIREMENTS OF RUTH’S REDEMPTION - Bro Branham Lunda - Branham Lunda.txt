somebody to be closer to you [Music] [Music] [Music] in the name of jesus christ amen amen four rich chappie cat ruth chapter four we're going to take verse 1 to 6 today then went boaz up to the gate and set him down there and behold the kinsman of whom bose was a spec came by unto him unto whom he said ho such a one turn aside sit down here and turn and you turn aside and sat down and it took ten men off the elders of the city and said sit here down here and they sat down and he said unto the kinsmen now to the kingsmen naomi that is come again out of the country of the moab settler a self apostle of land which was our brother elima lex and i thought to advertise these saying but buy it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people if thou will redeem it redeem it but if thou will not redeem it then tell me that i may know for there is none to redeem it by beside thee and i am after thee and he said i will redeem it then said bose what the what thou buyers defeat what what day thou bias the field of the hand of naomi thou might buy it also of ruth the moabitess the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance and the kinsmen said i cannot redeem it for myself lest among my own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for i cannot redeem it [Music] you have inspired these words and their anointing we can hold together and uh us speaking and knowing that the devil does not like this day but we are more than pressured he has no power because it's been anything bless thy people that have gone give them the anointing as we commit the service unto you or know the senior jesus in the name of jesus christ amen amen thank you may you may be seated and i greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ you can also greet one another may god bless you richly it is good to be in the house of the lord and now [Music] possibly a preacher cannot take all the angles for as much possible sentence the holy ghost teacher can open to us even more you can see barbara branham preaching arrow shall restore the divine presence he goes somewhere else he preaches the same presence your friends are somewhere else so he goes a little bit deeper than other places amen amen today we're going to see the four conditions or requirements the four requirements of redemption condition the four requirements to be a kinsmen redeemer automatically we redeem everything that belongs to naomi van gaal as we just read it in the bible boaz montal apart boaz went to the gate [Music] know when the person asked if they had to ask questions or not hey lisa what do you know and people say no he said i said people are afraid of what huh don't be afraid in chapter three ruth went to the feet of balls and she said to boys but she had the revelation that this man had declared righteousness but she had to go with humility said humility and when bulls saw that humility is [Music] but you came to my feed to say that i have had the right of to redeem a guest is a person but what happened boaz uh the boys avi and levi the bulls are removed on his skirt chris you don't lose sentence god christ gives the holy ghost to the church regardless to keep the church in the right portfol garden to keep you straight and fair hey because this robe served to our route ourselves amen amen us and we're living in the age of us the last one valedictory as the bible would say the devil is roaring like a lion he'll share a key illusive seeking who to devour who he cannot seduce you he doesn't want you to get to the right to play this technique he has a multiply all these traffic light media with media like television television let's steal and a style le mans and uh fashion eleven he really got to the point because he knows that these things can capture people's mind television and uh this is today's tv show the devil uses so much of these things but then we don't know the sentence but god gives us the leave ruth as such they said they said stay here at them and tomorrow and you'll raise up early in the morning and when she left early bo was appreciated and foreign and god also gave the the food to keep the church they will set your mouth and to the seventh day and probably it's the age of restores himself comes down hallelujah the right of redemption on you melia kelka but there's somebody after you've taken this decision you've be about to be rewarded men amen may advocate but before to be rewarded there are two term processes there's a whole process sse processes it's this process that we want to see amen well you can see in the bible it is only saying let's read once again chapter 4 where we read overseas i believe verse the one who had to write the kinsmen spoke about [Music] name fred bananamedi says get certified that this work or is it this story of rules it's truly the entire plane of redemption how he was not a jew people neda de gashi a born in a mess now but now must be redeemed to be particular in the family of jesus incentive and to be called a holy woman the same way for us give some of the pressure who are sinners but they're spoiled and without hope a condemned media pass against but god by his grace he wants to take us and serve the new descent and to make of us saints fear the new sonia and make of us his bride remarkable knowledge i'm saying doesn't is [Music] your knowledge shall increase and your eyes shall be opened and afterwards adam and eve because of the sermon of the devil the serpent may not know what did you but now the law of god amen amen the love of god said si and nom tom if a man falls as a premier position to bring back this man to his first position of state he'll request avoir second appellate redux it requires redemption a set redundancy and this redemption exists it uh [Music] defend the service now we get into the closing of the service come before a man could redeem a lost property he'd never eat le pre prospero he had to be the nearest kinsman said that's the first prosperity he has to be the kin and the nearest kinsman doc now for somebody to redeem cat recon he must be the nearest kinsmen brush nearest now we're going to see with all those requirements that god puts for somebody to be a kingsman we'll he must be an upright man or adjustment he must be a nearest kinsman he must be an uprising or just a antagonist or to be uh upright to just second law and now we must not find even a small blame ahmed amen not even the smallest deja parties now only on this second one all the human beings have fallen decades [Applause] frieza maurice he had to be worthy enough attraction he had to be worth enough money let's say rich say rich don't do etherish you must be rich sif is a marriage you have to be enough rich and then the last condition a particular person the man has to be enough right now the person has to be rich enough a president after filling those three requirements and the fourth to dua a president you must be after that ten year people come up to make a public testimony i think that you write it like that don't publicly public a public testimony now let's go slowly hey end question what happened boaz balls savvy tutsi condition knew all those requirements and the boss knew that naomi you cannot have a naomi without having uh you cannot have rude without having nothing else because it was naomi that was tied to the family of boa naomi naomi ellie miller his her husband was eliminated naomi coming back into the land but since i cannot do it because there's a more nearest man you can be in the family yeah there was probably the elder that has to do it that's why he says kinsmen that's a passage that was already a check and tag he must be just better probably he would go through but he must have enough money remarkably notice what he says here when the opportunity was given to him tonight you have to redeem it he said luigi before i cannot redeem it amen amen amen that a redeemed no shame sorry no i cannot dua to pedophile you can do it because i'm not able to do it forever no rules are represented represents you when adam fell no it's our fathers who failed and we fell with them met enough but now can we rested and set conditions we didn't have to stay in that condition and the devil had the first made them and he had everybody locked up in prison now he requires somebody must be a nearest kingsman he required a man to be right and tagged and to be faithful not [Applause] i speak with you face to face amen amen but you will not be able to do it bhaskar because because birth killing set in luala del amor and this law of death to redeem it sir exigent he must be a nearest a person gracious grace by christ he is reconciling the world it's god the spirit that's just said he made the flesh he has the flesh like you and i jesse chris jesus christ he had it was uh having hungry like you and i they're coming to some attention tempted like you and i live fully he wanted basketball and when he declared it lord may see the men here then he had the right of redemption for naomi he could not do it he'll defer to the patronage he said the unless our mama my own inheritance i cannot redeem them and now you boys you fell after you can do it hello now what would the boys do boast boys equity listen you're considering in the book here what problem says here boaz represent a christian now boys represent christ great represent legless now chris represented the church who requires you the believer [Applause] because god will not lose anybody else that you the son of god will never will be lost regardless of what the devil will do is so that adam can be lost so totally yeah i did but god says the recession that this one is my on my very side i have to do everything oh i love it if i have the revelations just switch some faith that i am his son i was in his house there's no way for me to be lost [Applause] come to him in hell too unless if i was not the son of god amen amen amen hello and then i'm continuing became man that man man might become god yes a god became men so that men may become [Applause] that positions you oh oh god probably continued on saying no we being men the person sinners god became a sinner appreciate no peace took our sins upon him knowing no sins stepped under elected a person yet was a sinner but second oppression because our sins was placed upon him that we he may be coming that i might become him he'll never emphasize he became a sinner because the devil that i might become a son of god he'll never happen he became a sinner fool them yeah that you might become a son of god and now we are peace sons and daughters of god per second because god was made a king folks fall by sex he'll focus on willa it required that one give her a transparent that would be a kingman that will fulfill the requirement will you necessitate he has also to be born through women and but but despite and himself [Applause] already you cannot feel fulfill the requirement amen amen eating a pepperoni please you cannot fulfill the requirements despite of how much god can use him he used him in a mighty way but he is not our kinsmen redeemer he says the word faith made to a human being deva empire became a kinsmen he defended he becomes a man oh but the devil could not redeem us pascal remembers the tempest because the devil himself is a sinner and he doesn't repent at all the devil does not repent at all when you see somebody who doesn't know how to ask for forgiveness there's only the devil does not repent at all and now observe the two spirits judas and they already took jesus amen hallelujah they were multitaining jesus i didn't know that they're going to mistreat him this way that's how they're mistreating him that's why the devil is not your friend let you have an apartment the devil is not your friend secular affair those who are trying to do what he's trying to do is to push you in to do it but he will never bring you back say and i want to read the word he says that it was the devil that had to redeem it in the same sermon he says let's get to the end of the story in the in the parable and listen carefully this other one whoever decided on us since you and i italy diablo was the devil because you sinned him appropriated because you was you his property for you were born in sin was that a consider shaped in iniquity venus [Music] and all he could not he could not become another devil to take away the devil merchants but the christ he is some person being sinless air defending became becoming a messianic he could redeem us we are [Music] to the place where they had left a lot of people and they got very smart when he once he gets there regardless look at his ears he knows that he is sunk he jumps up and once he jumps and he runs he finds his way hey and the poor sheep doesn't know how to find the way when he gets there oh oh and to the slaughter and they cut his head secondly that's what the devil does he will take you to the slaughter he will have you killed him and he will not have the right glory be to god that there's such because the consequences is paying really good amen not ready but our god officer when he's so dying he said that there's no killing he's an especially i am a spirit why from according to pharisees to say among you who can accuse me of sin depend upon them and who can condemn the persecutor he is because he knows yes he was the god of men flesh he led that sample he was a hundred percent the creator god a hundred percent a man why a hundred percent a human being he had to be like you and means that you have to have the ability to pay oh you have to have the means to pay let me know me now notice with naomi elimelech appropriately malek has his property and that was sold away now naomi comes back we have to redeem that last night and the only way to do it is [Applause] is it requires that somebody familiar in the family of the nearest kinsmen the end comes to redeem what is about [Applause] but also everything that belongs to her amen amen and when the boy said it publicly yeah the hell of the the because i don't have enough fun what did boss do what was i addie bo said okay oh the wealth formerly since he cannot do it now listen in israel 11 and now he came in he'll remove his shoe development before the elders and he said celiac and kendall if there's anybody else keep bethany who can come russian and [Applause] [Applause] that's what our time to live for the levitation we can even go into the book of readiness in the book of jeremiah how did the contractor offer off by hallelujah hallelujah he was hidden in a vessel so that one day so that he cannot be lost let's go in revelation chapter five and assault with seven seals and and i saw a strong angel the created universe proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to obey the free relief to open the book get down wrong prayers and lose the seals thereof a bear son of dallas and no man in heaven not in earth me under the earth he will freely sleep who was able to open the book needed who is [Applause] that was sort of like your rights are in there a person and nobody left good friend recently take the book open and break the seals and the bible says hella be ladies and the bible says yes jeffy and also verse verse 4 and i wept much the second person because no man was found worthy to open to um or to read the book and one of the elders said to me this is john who's writing and the people asking the questions you always speak of the kingdom of god the word shall come i said discipline through this so this year that you love so much jesus jesus said to him if i leave a word that he leave jesus said until cave that this man of john who would leave the physical venue and he feel the coming of the lord make us get you but what did jesus do and god takes him into the isle of perfect and there the devil does not like it and it says nothing caterpillar is they worry not amen amen sjv and behold later verse five and one of the elders said unto me point whip not voiceless behold the lion of the tribe of judah le reset on the david the root of david avenky prevailed to open [Music] and among the elderly elders and having seven homes but the before the foundation of the world and then now and the bible says lanier is certain and the the the lamb came out when the dead came out the angel could not see the angels they [Music] to reveal the mystery to the bride you give him the grace of

used it all and he became poor nothing didn't work for him everything is that yes a true son of god god will always punish him to god to trust him to come back that's why you see the sons of the devil

saints jesus now he sees jesus the one who said in the 40 days without i'm giving you a good recipe you can take this bread with stones and transform it to breakfast and jesus being the word he understood even if i'm hungry this is the thing is to form and then the devil didn't come in a form of a demon but the devil always comes on the mind he says it's on the mind that you have to fight him jesus jesus said to him no no i'm getting you now i have the control here oh you don't have the right oh no oh i love our god mechanic but when jesus comes down when the devil wanted to hold it oh

a kingsman redeemer to redeem the lost estate of ruth and people he had to make a public testimony two secure patents are rich and that and then everything that rude fell to him as he redeemed all of her possessions when he redeemed naomi why he got rooted in secular which is a type of the gentile bride amen amen and so on now he was a kinsman he is in the form of the spirit save one he doesn't call the chest was well in the body of our flesh he attacked some faces yesterday there was his son jesus he became a parent of human beings affected so he can uh he can take over cbd so he can feel the pain that he pronounced on the human being himself oh oh i got that in other words circumcision and jesus paid the price and and took us out amen amen i love this he says see let preach the price was already paid for now when jesus died at calvary equitagle he lives in church he served every single day in the world now he wasn't saved 10 years ago oh two years ago it wasn't or three years ago i test [Music] but it's been a long time ago that god has served you oh jesus and jesus didn't come down and die just for me excuse me forgive me jesus didn't come down and die just for me but you

senator [Music] that you have when you come to heaven he doesn't serve you on the merit of your prayer he'll never serve a person he doesn't save you upon the merits of your righteousness he serves you upon the merit of your faith that you are saying and that through grace now you can you know death to be a sinner grateful person you you are sorry for your sins you repent of what you've done and

were saved listen and you get along with people who are saved amen amen and you associate with those who are saying hey foreign and that produces salvation for you is that right is the same way for divine healing you believe being healed you believe you heal like the testimony i heard kelly called dianist somebody was diagnosed with her diabetes and the the physician tells him don't take your
