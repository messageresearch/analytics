system that when you talk about the church the local convo pallidal eglise church of ephesus degrees the face right IATI philadelphia philadelphi they are always two seats he had to joke this amount and the letters was written to the age in a letter addressed it is not written only to the true believers any person Madras and require but it written to the angel first message decryption address upon a melange and the pastors go take from the angel of the jelly pastor this was a lousy did a lounger the law congregation Polacco eglise and bottom show DC from democracy see as the letter was written calmly letter K take hit is written to as the church as to and false viola mantra colleague Lisa of raela movas vineya that's why I want to add this John 15 requests vegetation cancer from the

right what is coming next so here we see even the message to the seven churches positively brother branham took the two vine ravanamma philadelphia to tie it with the seven church age letters to show that in every church Oh Monica - Akkad Lisa the letter was written to the church through the messenger but it was addressed to both the to the false and they to vine that's why every message to every church educational eglise you will see David can you see can you project my they said it they plan for the seven Church ages touch it a little bit last Sunday to show another aspect so the first bullet point was the people to whom the letter was addressed the points et le push to Jean I'll kill that right addressing and we said several times so far we know the V on the pleasure of Rajesh Khanna the letter was addressed to the angel that's why you will see the message to every Church age the Bible said written to the angel so that is style of the message to each church age the first is the addressee is a wiki address because those are letters last Sunday late if you take in the natural rim you open it on the domain night when I write a letter I have to specify to whom I'm sending the letter you are the clear specific yes cousin was it late so the letters to the seven church ages Lynette was it Ashley Gleason it was not to the entire church but to the angel messenger of each age then the messenger to the entire church to believer and force believer to and false vine so as we read the message to every church age when we read a letter comunism we have to keep this in mind or goddesses yumpin see it's to both say acid second bullet point leader jump one is about who is the author of the book the letter C is a jidaigeki ascii LOL Allah always Christ - yo Keystone not John by John John was described not the author God told John write this idea Italy so if I want to send a letter to brother Obed I'm unable to write because you see incapable I can say Julia sento brother Oh baby oh baby oh but the letter is still signed by me my letter to your senior julia is the one typing in Julius's that's exactly between Christ John and the angel who received the letters I see untwist is noisy launch Consuela later and as he introduced himself as the author of the letter a commitment would you commit on low telemetry that's why he has to introduce himself in one of his appropriate attributes to us and would advocate visit rebel appropriate the third thing they start by praising the church ilysm a knowledge meant of your good works I know thy works when even its knowing you are still coming to church narrator even to Joanna Gleason a man I mean you have to praise the people we have to praise our wives we have to praise our husband no even if Julia see Emanuel TV front of Cheaper it's a part of love if a party do not move therefore bullet point now come the rebuke you I know your work you are a good husband you always buy clothes for me to be my birthday present however very good wife cook good however lady man so this is the style of the letter was largely still della lettera if we can also keep it in our life gob God SLO see the movie it's gonna and pass that value CD next bullet point points vivo you see it become a message of repentance by a seed massage the repentance because it's two vines Divini they give to both the opportunity to repent for they reaffirm the rebuke to opportunities elephant ear diamond I know thy work however man this is what I have against you what this occurs you come true to us and when did I tell you what is I am against you for a second - ah it's not just to put you down in a popover we say poverty but it's an opportunity for you to repent in opportunity gives the donate over a Ponte now with this bullet point advocacy porn only the two vine will repent sovereignty and the first vine will not repent they will do some kind of so-called repentance but it's not a true repentance from the heart even fair in certain agenda repentance machine a pain repentance given it will be a religious formula in informal religion it's just a religious formula you hear what the Spirit is saying is physically spent indeed this the opportunity given to the church for the church to repent see an opportunity a dress a leg is posted so as we listen to the message of the seven church edges condos acutally message the city lately we will be happy to receive the praise they all contain the festival it won't thank you Lord for praising me because I accepted the message is accepted myself because I got baptized because I'm ever good for to go to heaven after you know bond posted a loose however whenever they say however holy man I have to pay closer attention you don't material because that's what is big - they reward volatile compounds because if you don't repent sheepish kcroone aponte part is the reward villarrica given to those who have repented here dunya ii upon t on every church educational it means you get the price you can rebuke the will you react from the rebuke you repent and God said because you have repented that may be from a very shameful habit that Rodina be to the dream of a garden is not ungrateful journey / Angra if you truly repent Paskus avahi pontine God has to reward you jewelry compensation and if you don't repent to live upon typical victim Oh God as now to punish you do a manova Pini are you with this type that style this is just introduction I did not get into the church message of but this is the plan for those who have this book only seven Church ages message you listen to those you go to every age that burden that it's not just a learning within a pastor in a but it's also an opportunity using opportunity to get closer to God you that's why after the message the message of repentance in my bullet point I said opportunity for the to believer to repent sincere confession but to fall to vine mehleb evasion we're not repent available and we'll go into judgment valley and the next bullet point is marcus me it's an option Phillips you to accept or reject the message of repentance whether you put it into blue it's hard to read anyway and following bullet point the same thing it's the reward to the over common knowledge a compound of anchor if you repent every age shot are those people who have received a rebuke secure his Villa happy Monday and they have repented upon God who gave them the option to accept or to reject the rebuke don't accept Allah for those who average accepted who seek York City there will be a reward a man so in the message we read it as we see the book of Revelation as well it can move why you know Lee live at apocalypsis see the first three verses that we just read this morning again the book starts with the revelation of Jesus Christ Ivica most václav havel as you listen usually we want to understand move along compound that the seven Church ages before we get to the message of the very first church age of volcanoes an evil message the premier actually Jesus Christ come to introduce himself this request of the important of young women who is this is to say for every church age every church age must know love connect the supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ even it a supreme this inertia a twister without this fan Stella you you are lost with that pair deal I said because one is the one without the supreme in revelation of the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ you are lost from the seniors request of Jeopardy and from verse four that's what God willing we will start on Wednesday I wanted to notice here Vavoom our King John to the seven church churches which are in Asia Jean said ascetic knees like you saw on azim now it's not John again who's the author is any passion kilo not grace be unto you peace cannot grass in a paste.what i do name from with him which is and which was and which is to come a given so the greeting now John is transmitting to the church and Allah selita's occasion from the transmetal agrees it's not John greeting the church in a patient on disabilities but it's him who is who was who is come coming mrs. zwicki sv8 a given which is christ greeting the church so you were not there Paula Christ old John as you are writing the letters this morning is a matter greeting from him that's what he's saying to us the coup de grace and peace Philippi in other words Shalom to the church hello Melissa peace to you who not only greeting coming from him Christ finder servitors don't give us a Madeira crystal but also from the seven spirits which are before his throne ada Lapidus said they speak is only for some Tony I know the seven spirits Martin Columbine Columbo and Branham so the same greeting and shallow wanna be a man so this is what we will get into a little bit more on Sunday God willing Wednesday so we see in the book of Revelation the first chapter the apocalypse upon Jesus Christ will present himself from the first verse the present premier saying the revelation of Jesus Christ we see him in verse eight of the first chapter lulav way of the sea with the premiership Ito saying I am Alpha and Omega will Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end Comus my love said the Lord the same which is and which was and which is to come the Almighty - so the book of Revelation develop the seven church a Jesus Christ Himself is the women and as we said Wednesday come to life don't do the market go into verse 11 the Bible said the lady saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last communion and what did I see as a secretary well write in a book quickly doesn't leave that was the older class was given to John as it allowed ownership he took John in the high love Pat Messina pre is jean-denis you lil depend show him they think that will come every Montana shows that they need see in the last church age if world only Daniel you see The Messenger will a message a that's him John saw it Oh John John was about to rise over Lake let only say John a little and equip it so John saw only thing I love Jovi to see shows right in a book really doesn't understand it to the seven church churches which are in Asia he D of will use it with Lisa offensive and to Ephesus Smyrna of minimus criteria Atia team and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia of nephila days and unto Laodicea Pentecostal upon tokoto until the rapture which is commonly mow grass is dealing with churches through the seven ages for the churches of the Gentile Paul eglise de Santi everybody should be in one of the churches churches they have to recognize Africana that Christ did send a letter and to the messenger only a crystal oh well let me say and what the messenger received a letter it only message a visual on it we all can read the letter in the book in the Bible who want to smell elated honorable only the messenger of that age will be able to read between the lines to the edge of what they say laticia miserable miserable she will explain us what the misery is values explicates of qalam is a the misery let me say is not about the food you have on the table any part and we talked a lot about the car you drive in a pile of what you convey but how you fail to recognize the star of your day make America wolf is kinetically how blind to see the manifestation of the Sun of manifestation and the quality names so that's what is written the letter is naked yes we so that's why we skip to verse 20 no no man over 70 even verse 18 even the end of verse 17 fear not I am the first and last make up one just really I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore is it a movie what is a man who's that yet Issa does the revelation of Jesus Christ and have the keys of hell and of death easily claim or a decision more if the Catholic Church said they got the kiss me like he's got to lick these or likely they are like the person who got the key of death and life in a more eleven is Christ week history write the things which thou has seen actually don't live shows the katrien and I think which are a selkie soul and the things which shall be Hereafter illa shows the kid over here they oppress Elsie now first 29 Oliver 7 the Bible say bloody it's a mystery that a mistake the seven ages so this is the mystery talking about the mystery of the Seven Stars a dilemma steady sate a 12 and a mystery of the candle stick a dish on delay that's exactly what the seven church age is are exactly and then we say where did you find this chart etc that's a revelation 1:20 the mystery of the Seven Stars in mister the city 12 which thou sawest in my right handed you have Adama medal so who's right and it is the right end of Christ it's not like Christ as the left and the right hand but right hand means the power of God neural network so the seven church edges are they in the power of God elicited the seven messenger from the power of God listed messages of yundal Ahmed what did you so the southern star which does thou sawest in my right hand listen to 12 key to have a dominant seven golden candlesticks elicit jean-denis this is not in any material it's golden important material module of gold is always to do with dating and love affair appearance Allah divinity a man huh so they deity and Allah divinity is holding the messengers the messengers are not dating companion definition polity the deity is the one holding the messenger so if you start worshiping the stars of Comus ability to Allah you have a wrong revelation of the Bible who's available Centara villas so in no one of the seven Church ages God is literally nobody can worship the messengers on an epidural it means needed a last Church age nobody but unfortunately they my livers before between them at what and that's something you the church you have to stand and fight for with everybody near a combat if a preacher says something going in the tendency and ASEAN predicate up a little set on down brother door to swallow words because that's called death fastest a light up a little more and there is no way around in your party do to you what to do when I'm sad when I maybe you have that revelation you are lost you cannot be confused be predestined the all the objects are candlestick is a wicked and the Bible itself explains the seven stars is it it was all the angels of the seven churches only say tonsure disagrees and the seven candlesticks and he sits on the knee which is also etiquette you have o the seven churches solicitor re Gleason and the Bible say Labib lady those are mysteries the last Sunday Mustaine so when there is a mystery any mistake there must come a revelation loving we saw in the last days we must come to the revelation on one of those stars no this is 12 because this is the time mystery must be unforgettable Allah mr. Dorf eight and as I said last Wednesday comes you'll ad-lib you came from different denominations you ever listen to different creatures you have equity different predicate Kubuntu a lesson you Alysa none of them who can don't will ever preached even if they read this verse I'm seeing is a silver saying none of them as given the name of only one even one messenger okay let me say Oh William Branham William commissioned for the last age according to revelation 10 seven apocalypses when the mystery will be unfolding mr. Advani we will know the hidden things Dan Burnham came according to me the first judge age messenger is it not a pitcher but it's a ball because look at the Bible with the Pacific Adela be Moses Ruiz is the one what most of the Old Testament New Testament devoted to the Gentiles on is not to Peter it's ballsy for Paul is the messenger he moved to the second church edges audism' many preachers who could predict many famous people could be said not Polycarp it is a purple because Polycarp was leaning a little bit more toward God denomination you the scholars ruling video come talk to brother Vinnie Paula Bonham and nobody today nobody he look at one family very faithful from Fidel brother Martin the uncle and brother Padres nephew I'm saying well Patrick st. Patrick he was a good believer among many testimonies but what brother Martin has done is a gamma system one day he took his coordinates eventually with the diamond only we cut it in two they say if we both can live DC to the desolate Anointed One omnia well say the passage of the age should be at Martin Martin so Martin is the uncle of Patrick I love Martin along with a particular I will tell you a little bit more about he was so this is how Burnham came become such a ban on a easy to choosing in one of each one of the messengers demanded the anointing of the Holy Spirit so that he can notice the words done by each one of them keep with him a scalable Arabic if a shock and untrue amen amen so we are gonna take the message don't want to miss on the revelation of Jesus Christ talk of 70 gossip Taunton brother Branham said Robin a medium historians agree this historians on the code this is John's life si la vida John talking about the book of Revelation alone live with apocalypse Jonah lived the last of his years in the city of Ephesus a vacuole attorney disagree daniel has an it is a villa and died he was he was on the Isle of Patmos he literally Department at the time he wrote the book revelation multi like le livre de bocalee it was not the story of his life and it abolished or deserving but the story of Christ in future ages man is nothing what is written tikitiki is not the life of Johnny Pallavi - what Christ McChrystal in the future ages on the size of the knee because John wrote two things Vasquez Johnny killed shows before the edges have gone desire it was a prophecy the prophecy not the life of John Bala video not the life of Christ our Vedic Eastern but man prophesy of an edge to cut map of it is on an Asia it was not his prophetic utterances in a day passing the prophet termina prophetic oh but the lord's exaltation solemn acetate sampler complete more exalted crystal it was not the revelation of st. John the Divine DiPaola revelation but the revelation of Christ the Lord revelation the history it is the last book of the New Testament really delivered neva testimo yet it tells the beginning and the end of the dispensation of the gospel to Josiah polity like Luca most my life and a lady sponsor shown the Virginia God Bible scholars agree on deal a bit less on the code this you know brother poem is very specific ergonomic speci he said the letters to the seven churches it is let us attach the likies so the message to the seven church edges slowly massage was really nice it was in the form of letters city-owned format electro because they are letters ascii adelaide every letters must know the author must have the author is accurately net above a warren hotel and the addressee a silicon addressed but just writing to brother Isaac every letter in the mailbox it's like that it to later adult mailboxes it to soak up some prophetically to the future ages and if we go in the Bible is you know control Allah be below you take the book of Revelation you will also notice I think I mentioned this on Wednesday but to catch up before we chapter two you will see the Bible said the
