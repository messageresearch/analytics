the story of Joseph they take a little bit the portion Joseph by in general Joseph can Inspire us a lot of things in Joseph the spirit of forgiveness in Joseph we can see perfection in Joseph we can see Faith all other elements in the life of Joseph we know that well the story of Joseph I was sold by his brother akos de sondon because of his gift okay Joseph Joseph God has the purpose with Joseph he also had a purpose for you and I don't know so everything that happened in life Joseph is a disaster that happened in the life of Joseph had a purpose that had a purpose amen amen God did not create us just we are useless God created us for a purpose we are here tonight for a purpose you are seated here foreign hey Joseph and Joseph Joseph you see Joseph despite all the the damage the wrong things just check the characteristic Joseph never complains Joseph never murmur Joseph did not hate his brothers after this dream he had other dreams as you know stories we see the bread of Joseph Illinois they started hearing him [Music] and you bring them food and when Joseph went along left Friday Joseph and when the brothers of Joseph between them they were saying this is a dreamer Hillary he's just coming this dreamer what does he think he is therefore this time we're gonna finish with it it is they even had the desire to kill their own brother but Reuben said no we shouldn't kill him it's better to take it to put him in a little hole or to sell them as you know the story and they took Joseph hola me dancing and they put him because God had the purpose for you foreign [Applause] 1958 I know this school I love this code is uh I know it will position somebody tonight said Equity now listening I know we love our Prophet don't we but foreign you are here to serve a purpose just like as my finger here electricity he's here for a purpose my finger is here for a purpose is for a purpose is to serve a purpose yes he was not put here just to see how it looked like when it was going to be put here it was put here to serve its purpose it was God's Divine plane to do so and if you were push here foreign [Applause] [Music] base the plan of God for my life because

plan of God in my life nothing destroyed Joseph he was pulling the world yeah there wasn't any water in the world because if it was worried would have been dead but God is wonderful when we're going through headache we don't know where to do it God has had a plan forever even when you die there's always the way out amen amen Joseph complaining he was there quiet what is he teaching us [Music] [Applause] [Applause] trust you [Applause] [Applause] you don't know who he is foreign was blessed and the devil came hey and by uh the channel of uh the wife the wife Joseph was saying I can't

the the shirt and when he left that family okay the woman said right this is I have the problem there's a lot of thing in life you foreign [Music] that God is training you [Applause] training you don't remember me when they're treating you in the wrong way let this here let this prayer that was in Joseph be in our lives what happened Joseph and prison Joseph was in prison Joseph from prison Joseph in prison innocent in this case my personal and nobody believed me I'm prison there the Bible says God was always with them because when you have the word of God you keep it in your heart spare airport no matter where you are yeah God will always be with you Amen in prison yeah [Applause] he just had a dream let don't there's yourself the gift of Joseph left Joseph the brothers of Joseph could not kill them [Applause] even though people are so jealous about it says [Applause] amen amen foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] when God will put Edgar [Applause] uh [Applause] the person that you find my cup and the money inside his bag tell them that they have to come back and the servant went when they got their decision you stop we're here and let's say the Lord said foreign [Applause] [Music] found the the cup in the back of this significance how are you going to tell the news to your father Allah when they went back they cried out we didn't want to do this he said no it's impossible you went to the point of stealing myself bigger brother and to see it they say don't do this [Music] are you with me I'm jumping a lot of stuff because I know you already know that yeah [Music] started telling Joseph please you know our father told us [Music] when Joseph heard that his brother Benjamin and then he said he just said take everybody and then he left crawling crying and he came back he said is your father still alive you say yes our dad is still alive yeah I'm fair and then at the end he will reveal himself this is where we read it is let's just read it again Joseph told his brother Joseph I'm Joseph as my father yet live and his brother could not answer him for they were trouble at this presence just imagine you sold your brother and you thought like that and you find yourself before your brother who's telling you oh no I wasn't there I'm your brother that you you hurt the Consciousness that's what the Bible says they were trouble in his presence Joseph Joseph said unto his Brethren approach come new to me it is I'm Joseph your brother whom he is don't be angry for selling me now he said it's to preserve your life that God did send me before you pay for these two years as the famine been in the life on the second sent and God sent me before you first seems to preserve your prosperity and to save you by the great Deliverance so now it wasn't you that sent me here my god [Applause] he has made me Father too Lord of all these houses [Music] he had the whole Authority and he could just said you're the one who sold me I got you now I get you now not today you see how God made me now I became a man I will show you I'll pay you back what you did to me this is how the nature happens this year it is [Laughter] somebody can say Amen [Music] and what happened Joseph Joseph said it was the purpose of God [Music] [Music] we never fight God will bless you God will bless you every day now listening God has a lot of blessings and we cannot live with this little blessings sometimes we live by chance he really blesses and to have those kind of blessings we need to have the same behavior to have the same Spirit as Jordan amen amenities by prophecy foreign [Applause] in every age [Applause] it was Jesus in Noah said he was Jesus in Moses said that's Jesse and David it was Jesus in David it was Jesus Christ in Joseph I amen amen says it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] start by me [Applause] he said the same spirit [Applause] you will give us the same spirit that was in Joseph amen amen notice Joseph despise all these things even the Egyptians Oh What A Remembrance amen amen they will cry about why the bread of Joseph he was there the opportunity Joseph gave them the chance to repent amen amen to the way Joseph Joseph to save his family in a time of trouble if God created foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we push them away from the church [Music] [Music] [Music] to live God will hold you responsible for that soul may God help us that's the reason why did you think about this episode now look this year things that happened yes it was the last year the Russia started it was last year sit up it was last year he was last year 2022 right oh I'm sorry yes so 22 20. 2022. that Russia started Rising the pastor uh preaches a lot about uh Russia King of the North Federal in this it was last year it was last year last year [Applause] the previous pop passed away yes the previous pop died all this happened just not to show you other years but as we're moving to a new year we are approaching the rapture maybe for some people maybe death we shouldn't be having the same ideas same characteristics when somebody is still traveling everybody here is already when he knows his flight is I'm telling you the way is taking care of his suitcase and everything yes you want to make sure the most important document in this suitcase do they believe everything is being placed the most important document is the password in your business you want to make sure do I have my past Escape do I have my Visa say yes if it's not there you [Music] you will not travel your beloved said if any combinations he became like a song We neared them before it's up to us to work in our conscience to weaken our own conscience especially with everything that we heard about uh have passed to repent sensually and they did to tell God we want to be better you know what the bottom always said it's better to be true or to be a Christian let people know it amen amen we have to change a little bit I know by ourselves there's a powerful decisions and God will God [Applause] allow things to shake give us a correct basket because God needs correction amen amen this is what God wants to help us this year even for years to come to be found somewhere in glory oh my brothers [Applause] We're Not Gonna Love really love each other in heaven we have to start loving each other yeah easily foreign love without interest foreign uh that day on Calvary says Ephesians chapter four efficiency Ephesians chapter 4 verse 31st the Bible says this is the animosity let our bitterness and worth and claimer and evil speaking a tooth expressed dimensions and all evil speaking and wickedness disparates will be put away from you amen amen [Music] be kind one to another forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgotten you amen Joseph as Joseph without realizing it to finish 38 illness he was just a man a perfect man he gave his life an example and it was example for you now what can we do no see the first thing I want to say is [Music] Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life amen amen life is living for others foreign [Applause] for yourself live for others I can live for this brother here because she is a nice man Cena live for that men who hate you can kill you if it was possible say secular that's what they've done to him they killed him and he died he might save them he died for people that's why Joseph did accepted them in the time of trouble if Christ lives he said we take the place of Christ sister shows us if these things are not just looking for and for all of us we won't need any problems and now in the end don't say in this book foreign 1959 paragraph 36. okay you need it he said foreign [Music] when he came to me [Music] spearing in my face in my face calling me a snake in the grass that means we're not dead in Christ and then he said pray the demon person before nearly 10 000 people well he wasn't the man Louis certain number he's the man that he is perhaps with the family like you and I Mercedes that was doing that foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] it's a terrible devil just pray foreign [Music] said oh forever remember certain demotary it's a terrible devil to despise it always is always stand beyond the puppy sometimes we get used to us may God give us the spirit that was in Joseph Let Me Love You foreign [Music] foreign [Music] may God bless you thank you foreign feel my way every day I can give us that song As we sing it after we sing We Are Gonna Get On Our Knees to ask the grace of God so that that spirit I think was in Joseph which is so that we can foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] grow all day while this song and yes [Applause] [Music] [Music] know as I was
