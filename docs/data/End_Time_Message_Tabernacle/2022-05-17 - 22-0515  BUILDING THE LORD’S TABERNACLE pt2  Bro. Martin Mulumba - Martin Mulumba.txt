we look away unto you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated once again i'll greet each one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ happy to see each one of you all the strangers in the in our we believe that we are brothers of like precious faith as we look into the world i would like to continue with lord with building the lord's tabernacle today as we started it uh since uh the passover i'm still enjoying everything that the lord is opening even though we might not be able to preach everything here no means because uh in verse 22 pascal vander and when you reap the harvest of your land that shall not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when they're reapers not everything will be preached because the lord himself says ask a senior remember thou shalt not make clean readings not everything will be preached because we have to leave other things to force somebody else to preach them neither shall thou gather and any gleaning of thy harvest you shall find that somewhere else so you will not be able to do it we shall be unable to gather everything because one grain will go into the land basket amen amen we shall continue with uh building the lord's tabernacle no continuous just to be able to help everybody to follow along we'll have to review a little bit of the seven seven feasts along and then we shall be able to fall between the 607 trumpet but god's grace and from there will probably will close all depends on us is that that the apostle module amen amen it's sunday silly demons the day of the lord no rush honesty and we shall not tarry either day but it just depends on the leading of the spirit that's remarked upon the country we understand that uh the feast of the lord no company were given unto the children of israel israel is god's program commonly programmed this year and the children of israel and citizens when they came out of egypt egypt the lord has brought them about uh out of egypt into the wilderness we saw that there was have to be a qualifying lamb during the passover and uh during that time the lord himself had to choose to give the characteristics of the land listening that has to qualify for that specific purpose specifically and that lamb has to die and the lord gives us more information on those don't preach the information that when the lamb died they caught a new mirror there has to be a burial de vitiavor de lantern and the grain was to represent the feast of the unleavened bread they represented the fate of the on level and under the feasting of the unleavened bread you conducted faith depends on the verb the lord has to the people have to bake the bread without leaving legend do a song and the people had to consume it for seven days and the servants of god came along to speak of uh god's burial all day is us his death after the after his crucifixion crucifixion after burmese prison the pastor came on easter morning or the rising of the sun services to show his resurrection and in the same book of uh exodus the lord has said that you shall have two lambs one has to be killed and the other one has to be released showing his death and his resurrection and when his resurrection came about because resurrection the lord gave again more information that the sheave has to be waved before the people and the lord did not finish his program then we came about by god's grace did you with uh the feast of the weeks this amen what house shall thou build me back when the lord was coming along the senior he had all these plans in his mind ave to say and as he was delivering the program he called me delivery he had to use moses for that specific purpose specifically to help the people understand where they were going that he didn't call the people out of egypt just for them to hang around in a papillary purple disorder in order to fulfill this purpose and at the end of the feast of the week that i fed the cement or the feast of the pentecost who are affected then the lord has to bring out other information information because the people had to choose what kind of house are were they going to build him then the lord says and see they send your id at the end of these i'll offend this cc you shall count 50 days because this is the longest feast quest this is the longest period and the servants of god that came about again from brother ben during this feast basketball dossier has to know how to behave has to live under a certain atmosphere atmosphere under that such atmosphere suicides the atmosphere the lord has given him his spirit listen you are doing his son is free with spirit of wisdom they split their success and to be able to do all kind of work we see that this is applies also to the church application to a family to the preacher or predicate to every ministry in the household minister minister and when the lord was giving the people these abilities the people had to respond also and how were they going to do it being projected the people had the love to also teach others they were not uh just keeping everything to themselves because you have received without any prices and you also have to give without any price nevertheless you have to do it willingly it was not something to be pushed upon they don't have to constrain you to do it but the lord said i have laid down my life people who just forsook the world they said that it's not the time to do to build the house of the lord it's just time for us to go make our own good and if you carry on with just your own projects and you're only placing money in the bag with holes people how everybody have to come to that same umbrella how the father has to love the mother how the children have to be to obey to the parents in order to understand the sister of pentacles because this is the longest period the lord has done his part and the church has to do it and he carried on he'll continue and give us gave us also more information when he preached can you appreciate the contest and under the contest jesus people had to understand that the challenges have to come legendary but putting on all the arbors mentioned in ephesians 6. people were able to work accordingly yes because when they you can look in the book of nehemiah did not deliver the name because there was a withstand against the people of god resistance the enemies of the jews they were plotting against the words then every one of us stood in his post allah in order to be able to build the house every one of us has to understand this position a mother is a mother a married man a father as a father prepare each person has to progress in the ministry and this progression or this growth into the ministry give people the understanding at what level the walls were already but the work has to be done according to god's program the program during the time that god has given you because when the people when the people understood it they said that we started to work here some of us held the spear one of the tools of the baron anderson it's god's program sit down the program did you god wants to see it being done during that time and therefore when it takes all these elements he shows us that these are not just our things that we come and we preach out of the blues but these are things that the lord wants us to be aware of he says in order to be able to be effective in the work that we do because uh if a man does not plan ahead of what he is supposed to do the men will surely fail if there's no vision see apart people perish because when we are planning we plan according to what we have known that's why our faith is built upon the apostles and the prophets because the appropriate apostle and the prophet have done a certain way and the apostle and the prophets have built upon what they have learned in the old testament and when the prophet come around the prophet he shows us that we have to take it from genesis to a revelation apocalypse then the picture becomes clear hello that's why all the sermons are just mentioned to us in order for us to make us clear in what we're doing we can't go just uh one preach one thing the other one preach another the person does not just build because he feels that i have to make a cut here the sisters do not just dress because they feel that they can dress this way they can have makeups today and tomorrow we came from word to flesh but we didn't come from the word to our theophany menace as it was with jesus christ jesus but then this jesus alex is jesus he was the unleavened bread he said who shall accuse me of sinning because his life was a pattern islam was an example they also have this understanding of comprehension that we shall also go through the same process as the lord jesus christ and when the lord jesus christ went through a lot of struggles having no place to raise his head having a weakness to eat avedi and all these elements to sizzle [Music] la parola as it is given unto us then exodus 36 verse 1 then wrote belsalil and holy hab i and every wise every and everyone is hearted man a two thumb scishow in whom the lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary according to all that the lord had commended fear two seconds and moses called belle and oliab and every wise-hearted man in whose the lord had put wisdom intelligence even everyone whose heart steered him up to come on to the work to do it amen amen the people also had to have the desire to do the work the pepe de vocia vallee des pour a complete level the people just didn't no they have to call me first no yes there are people who will be not to be big can you do it papua come on the future affair but to do the work and they received of moses all the offerings which the children of israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary verse 3. to make it with all poor affair and they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning volunteer as the work was has to be progressing as the work has to be done completely you see the sweet shack matter during which time but not get done the longest period of time how long will your ministry last combined the lord himself knows no remember until every single piece of the tabernacle is in place yes one plus but the lord gives you wisdom and where do you get receive all that from eco questions you see moses and where did moses get it from here god himself you said yeah remember because moses had to go into the clouds out of the edges this disaster comes the seals out of the seals they saw the trumpets and the trumpets out of the trumpets just to trumpet the plagues then they play all this god giving us information don't listen for me to know where we're standing because when you understand where the church is standing at position like in the church ages then you know what to preach to the church because some of us are still children desiring sincere milk of the world looks at your children regardless of how the child is growing from croissants how look at how this one is still struggling with the word regards some have to be told exactly what to do and the children have known how to obey the mothers are saying eliza the children follows the mother saying and all these elements do says anymore the lord is giving us some more information listen don't preach the information in order to do the work because when the lord is giving us these basket calls you see it's to protect us in order to be able to fulfill really what he sees to be done that completely secure this is my beloved son he him i have to do my father's will completely this was no longer under governance but then it says when i was a child i spoke as a child as [Music] but then by our behavior if somebody has to follow up on how you're growing in your spiritual life again they said we're still under governors you know someone called us but then we're still under governors no more lao de whatever because then afterwards you born with the spirit and you have to come to the adoptions because as this child the the adoption sets in have voila you have to have the wisdom you have to have the understanding and all these things are given to us in order for us to be able to see where we're standing [Music] because in acts 10 verse 9 and we see that this follows the ministry of elijah the prophet and the son of man [Music] because jesus elijah ellis has to present the land which in the old testament was a shadow sentence and jesus he took the disciples by taking the disciples he trained the disciples many times that's where the churches fall into please please your office but in the book of uh exodus we just read only they only call bells and it's only belts on here no no only the commission was given only to such a person it's not because you have not seen how the person was called a person then uh you said like you know he is really called to the ministry god puts the potential in a man he does not ask any favor from nobody in the demand of the person it's not the laying of hands that makes him demand the receivers no no but the ministry is born with the men but the ministry has to grow eleminis each ministry has to sit under a certain umbrella in order to grow accordingly and when jesus came about he consciously even knew he dealt with the disciples the disciples which then afterward because they had to wait for a certain period of time but they didn't just like you know came out of the world and straight into the upper room that's why i'm saying we and he ended up as official of souls has to go through a lot of sharpening he has to be uh it has to be cut cut away certain things out of his life that's why when you get into sanctification you have to understand and enjoy the process you don't have to have weeks you don't have to have a high heels yes it's hard we said you do but it is a process messy and prostitution because there's a work ahead basketball completely because if you don't understand there's a work ahead that's why you're still holding on to this thing they tell you like you know you have to show up at a certain time and that is only preparing you for greater responsibilities it shall be in greater ones let's say i'll sit on the ground everything that was preached to you appreciate you have to believe them all you do though we might not always understand but we only believe me [Applause] that's why the prophet says only believe only believe once or more all things are possible but for what what is it being made for possible first experience and then you're going to mess up the work i see because the angel basket launcher who flew from the presence of god to touch the uh the lips of isaiah had to be in a certain position certain position in humility being unseen and unheard of and not be speaking your own things but to do exactly what the lord tells you to do okay exactly because you'll find isaiah in a certain position because isaiah all that he had known all these years is just the king the king was a role model to him the king was somebody you look up to because if you don't have an angel to look up to business then you don't know how to go along because isaiah looked himself he said that my communists turned into corruption say but then when you come before the lord they want to say yeah all that you say that's not mother name i know oh we should say i i have no knowledge gel reconnaissance according to what we have done second fair but what does the word say what do you know of the word what does the word show you how to behave or the feast of pentacles the lord listen yeah he brings out the disciples he'll amend the disciples and the disciples come around the disciples they look at the situation he said that for these people to do the work they have first to be filled with the spirit that's why the prophet says don't get married don't start a work in a certain ministry until you are first born again it is very important because your culture will fool you your knowledge will fool you by the time you come to do the work you come with a lot that looks and everything else here is some like two with less than a boat sof number two it will look like everything else assembly are two with their you look like everything else you resemble than the christians sophie but you'll be so close to porsche it looks like it is but it's not mesene palace because the deceiver today vasquez said the kyogre should be it will look so close to porsche yes you have to grow we need to do a grander but understand the things that you are struggling with is just delaying the work you only investing in what you think is best for you that shows that you're stubborn that's why when i'm in the prayer life he sees a minister come on [Music] he said you obedient a disobedience who do the word of god they treat this obesity did you god told you to do one thing was that precious spices oh our precious sister sir yet a sinner obedience to the word lobe son sarah it's better than sacrifice say sacrifice yes i go to church with your valley yes i do this jewish officers but god is requiring total obedience shall be made without leavening that dwight confess only and afterwards it becomes a wave sheath amen it was our example he i have to forsake many things william branham william put that television television he could have protected himself he proves deportation remember but the children may listen for but the church by the rest of them they were looking at to him what kind of wave shift shall you do what kind of tabernacle are you going to build is and the lord is bringing out the disciples yeah men the disciples the disciples have now after receiving the spirit verse nine you'll say nothing on the moral domain approach as they went on the journey coming mache and drew knight onto the city this approaches the house stopped to pray about the sixth hour and he came very hungry and i would have have eaten but while they they met already he fell into a trance he leaves ecstasy and saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending on to him he invites the son don't come in control as it had been a great neater at the at the four corners they coming to and creeping things it shows a ki rom and unfolds of the air it is yellow and there came a voice to him yeah kill two and eat a monk but peter said not so lord no poison yeah for i have never eaten anything that is common or unclean and the voice speaks unto him again the second time what god have and the vessel was received up inhaling to again into heaven eleven the lord is bringing peter into the ministry that's why it is important to receive the spirit important please we see that peter no peter peter received from god god was showing him what kind of ministry he has to deal with what kind of people he has to deal with but where did the people come from do escalations the bible says heaven open up the people came from heaven and they came down and what is god's doing you're it has to smell like the sheep what santiago baby he has to laugh like the sheep do us no no no no no i cannot hang out with them no no no no no no no no me i am holy sweet son no no your holiness is not what god is saying but his holiness message oh your holiness depends on him who has called you and what this is the what the god has given you say amen amen let's go to verse one of the same chapter because it requires to give us more information about information by having more information for myself it helps us to understand even better san jose there was a certain man in caesarea called the cornelius essentially of of uh the benedict of the band called the italian band the the bible is giving us who where the man was just as we deal with people here community which gave much homes to the people for example and pray to god always april the man was doing his earthly journey lump isaiah compresses some where's the best of his knowledge everything that he did but the bible says in the channel of communication he saw in a vision even evidently about the ninth hour of the day of the la nevia mel de jour which is 3 p.m our time an angel of god coming into coming into in to him and saying unto him [Music] and when he looked on him he was afraid and he said what is it lord yes senior giving himself to the world he said this man is persevering this man is moving forward and now it is time now to take him a little bit higher is not enough listen praying in the church is not enough to be good to people is not enough it can be a regular pepsi oh no it is just enough just like you know to love people say i said the email and then this man has enough money said thomas said that this man is a manager at work they told me this man had went to school this man is a devout man but he says and now sentimental job now and a call for one simon if every new seymour whose surname is peter yes you know me pierre and they just said sometimes we give ourselves nicknames you know it's not bad it's in a person it's the bible enlarge with one simon ethanol whose house is by the sea side yes he shall tell thee what you dow outers to do verse 6 uh [Applause] but at this moment the men had to grow a little higher lump and the angel comes through the channel of communication that's why we preach on the makeup of the bride here or the conception concept in that conception of the bride we understand that each person god has given them a channel for communications in numbers moses miriam and aaron god told i'll come through a dream the next fellow a lot of what's that it might not have those channels of communication and he might start doubting it all these things oh no they cannot be the importance to stay in a certain atmosphere because at that time at the uh the ninth hour or that shows that it's not the first time that the lord speaks to a man for him to say because if it's the first time what's this is that like william branham i'm going with him i've heard the voice so many times but then when the angel came physically don't know she take care then fear left me because he was able to recognize him who was able to i have received the visitation of the angels in a certain leadership and when the angel was uh which expect to anto as the lord dealt with uh you're going to pray for the sikhs all over the world but lord i'm not able to do it i have no education i don't qualify to do the work it's not about your qualifications struggling with but then when you have to move a little bit higher but then you start struggling alone what this vision which he had he had seen should mean behold now while peter doubted in himself remember what this vision which he had seen behold the men which was sent from cornelius inquiry for simon's house and stood before the gate they sat in here when the men received the commission god is only holding the unbeliever himself but then the lord is only proceeding with his ministry with his problems well peter you're still struggling do i have the knowledge to do it yes am i ready to do it the men were standing at the door no i'm sitting in this many times that's what it is use your first secret i don't know this is a person i don't have damage but i have first to have the knowledge of this [Applause] [Music] that's why that's how you understand people's ministries [Applause] people already the lord is not waiting for your approval no no he says that you know the work must be done at this particular time receive rise up left one god do the word [Music] no i think i have first to do this yeah i have to have so much revelation william branham saying william revelation came as much as i had need of it oh had had to be made without leavening development but the peanut was there looking at the bread garden with lavender he says no no the work is before you travel in the brethren as holy having this year affects you see struggling here look at them hey god super pro as holy yeah it is a hard thing to preach you appreciate it is a hard thing to the preachers say foreign had to look he saw himself with not disqualifying himself he'll say this california but the lord himself looks at him really regardless you are ready to do the work i failed and the people that you have to look to election day where they are they're mania god says they are holy son at the end of the feast i have fed the lab on the which people you have to talk to the people as billy graham had to speak to a group of people robert has to speak to a group of people and william brothers he had enough i showed you in the old testament in the new testament showing in the message and look around you call them holy son peter was struggling the spirit said unto him behold he was he three men sick thee their communication with the angel is very important communications church jayla do you have a new seller not a glitch no oh your holiness men men met holiness is filthiness before god fabrication but god looks at his holiness the way he looks at he said that this is a holy convocation because cordeles was a man that was fighting also to grow pascal because all the people that you're dealing with and god looks at you to look at the people like that be your wife your husband your your children look at them holy come the sun because they listen to the words pascal they are fighting to grow the lord knows how long he will take them together as the preacher in the position the knowledge you with the angel the holy spirit in you leading you on how to do the work otherwise the child is struggling to grow long force it back but you are the very [Applause] when you deal and how to lead them to get them out of the situation but don't push them into the dish no more the bread is already falling their sister is already following they share your job is not to keep them in the dish but your job is to take them out and how do you take them out fully how do you bring them out for the effects of you ah i thought you were a christian secretary of state you've been lying to us you know the child is growing wisconsin now he passed from my uh from tutors onto governors and that the child has to grow and the child is being in communication amen amen then verse 421 then appear went down to the man which was sent unto him from cornelius appeared they thought they said and said behold i am he whom he is sick what is it the cause where uh wherefore you are come killed and they said cornelius the centurion but these soldiers messes up they could testify he proved even his absence members on absence he said that man this thomas is adjustment amen an understanding when they can even see that he did this uh with uh he did it um it it did us with with all his mind he lived but they still call him holi because when william branham william was standing on the pulpit and standing in the bridge when he was repenting to the people somebody in the room started doubting him just right there just the angel struck him to show despite you have to understand if yourself have already come through the feast of pentacles and of good reports and was won from god by an holy angel sent a sender to a 4d in in into his house many times that's what happened in our lives it's not because like you know yes they have to look at your holy senate considering then you start doing whatever you want to do no he was a devout man the people he had the understanding [Music] come to church via gliese try a little bit and say uncle of the desire that you need to grow get to do a guns here but you do it expressly in your own thoughts merciful effect express just because the people have to take you holy basket legend consider 23 verse 17. and on the more of peter went away with them a certain brethren from joppa accompanied him and cornelius waited for them and and called together his kinsmen and and new friends cornelius because peter can look back at what happened and that gave him humility ah i doubted the vision oh these things is really true oh did the angel really spoke to me but then when you see somebody on the phone i never done this we will not debate with you we just look at the world we jesus christ that makes us us holy in our son despite of everything that we are we are about the sacrifice we are just men but when we look to christ he steps over he wants to see any but it also requires humility to speak of your weaknesses because many times you only speak about what is good you see me over here you see me me my testimony i'm going to kill him [Applause] that we never said to nobody india person we never confess but when you stand in front of the world but then in front of people i am holy i am holy spirit let's have the humility of paul of peter i only meditate the pier that's right that will help us to do the work yes lord i am born in sin we sent you all appreciated iniquity you may have never seen chippenham but your birth condemns you that humility said to me we will help you to do the work the preacher humble predication aside from the knowledge in egypt in order for god to use it the army came out in ezra and i have understanding now it's no more time of everything that we receive from egypt but we receive a new program program this year now in this program there's a way to behave so that when you can look at god's people that's a comfortable god you do not mistreat them because human nature is always to condemn you because human nature [Music] [Applause] even if the world calls you holy because the people can understand because the people can look at the situation it's not my notes but it's the leading of the spirit have no thought on what you shall say but at that time it shall be given to you the vision was not given to peter from the beginning of his ministry after [Applause] [Music] as he was struggling the people are there now people are here what are you going to do you're still struggling to continue i can't do it and you have to make yourself available it's willingly a wise woman enormous everything from sagittarius build up her own house gun street because you sanctifying yourself something to a man you'd come into church for the sake pull up yeah you can grow chipotle you're struggling my [Applause] [Applause] he went in and found many that would come together it was his year personal assembly when the people heard calmly purple your ministry is coming into town [Music] somebody's [Applause] god is not looking for people and offer certain extravagant knowledge left and right regardless because he has even uh uh he hidden it to the wise and because that music is so great music yes we it is your ministry that is attracting people it is your way of dressing up that attracts somebody to come to church [Music] [Applause] he
