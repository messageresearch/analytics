surely around here the throne comes down here standing in thy presence understanding low fat your program understanding the plan of redemption as you bleeding also feel the field of boast lord understanding the steps to take the decision a decision to come and labor in the field further we need have a donation lord as it was with nehemiah can you come sit down he came into the field he lived in the ocean and he labored in the world foreign the tool in one hand the man and the sword on the other side with a stick in his hand avec le baton de samara to go to take over father ponderos lord jesus christ ruth coming to work lord with venom lord as when lord of moses had labored he went back low father god gathered with his parents with his fathers and here we are no no no father got some historical events historic but our lives load menu our decisions no decision has proven further that we are ruthless we are the one seller that you have to we you have chosen us before the
