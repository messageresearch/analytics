========================================

may God bless you all so um this morning we just want to thank God for what he's done for us um as many of you know we have our first baby boy um and I just want to testify of what God has done for us um as many of you know it's been a little over two years that we we've been married and as any couple when we first got married uh we expected that you know God would give us a baby and after some time went on and on and we realized it wasn't happening um we I started questioning and wondering and being in the medical field I started wondering already what it could have been what could be the problem um and then I went to go I was discussing it with my husband [Music] and he told me just be calm be patient it will happen in God's time we'll just pray about it so after praying for some more time um I got impatient again and I told my husband that we should just go see a doctor um at first he was just like no no we'll pray about it let's wait and it kind of brought some back and forth between me and my husband because every time I would discuss I would want to ask him about it he just was so calm about it so relaxed and I told him I'm like at a certain point I even questioned him I was like do you even want to have children because every time you're just so calm about it's like you don't care like so after I kind of forced him back and we finally went to go see a doctor the doctor pretty much didn't tell us anything we couldn't find anything wrong they told us you're still young it will happen give us some general advice maybe it could be this it could be this so it was at that time that we realized that you know it's only God who gives life so we went into prayer and I remember at the time of the it was the July meetings uh we went to go see the pastor to pray for us it was a time that we were actually going through a lot of hardships a lot of but um we went and we bought him our offering and he prayed for us and after praying for us he told us don't worry you're going to have children you will have children yeah so so I kept that word in my mind what he said and every single time he kept encouraging us don't worry and he was always there supporting [Music] us so going through this time it was really tough it may only be two years but I feel like we went through a lot during that time sometimes as you know it is in our community people always ready to make comments at you what's wrong with you don't you see people who got married after you are already having children what's taking you so long not knowing what someone might be going through and I remember even one day I was teaching Sunday School and one of my kids said to me they're like sister Sharon we always see you carrying other people's babies but when are you going to carry your own baby so I felt bad in my heart but I just told them I said don't worry just pray for me I'm going to have a baby so and then I remember there was a time when brother OED came here brother and he really encouraged us with his testimony he spoke to us he prayed for us and um it was during that time that God really started dealing with us with me and both of us as a couple and um we were really in prayer there was times that we would come to church sometimes my husband would stay and sleep at the church we really created that atmosphere around us and then I remember there was a day I was feeling discouraged it was a Wednesday and I didn't feel like coming to church um and I remember telling God I'm like anyway what did I gain I've been coming to church never missed a service but still you're not blessing me but at the end I we spoke with my husband he ended up just convincing me to go to church and it was I remember it was a Wednesday evening brother Richard was preaching he was talking about the book of Rememberance so I remember um after the service it was really touching for me and the following day I came back to church and I started praying reminding God of all that I did for him all that my husband has done for him I told God that we walked in the right way we got married in the right way we honored the church we honored your word I dedicated my youth from the time that I was a teenager I started teaching the kids my husband since he was young everywhere he's been he's always served you so I remember being so desperate and I told God that I've been serving other people's kids I want to have my own children so after praying and crying out to him I opened the Bible and I remember the scripture I don't remember exactly what the reference was but I got an answer that said you will conceive and you will bear a son and I felt like that was God speaking directly to me and from that time on I held on to that word and I told my husband that we're going to have a son so um I I started building my faith um I had we have an empty room in our house and I started buying baby clothes and hanging it in the room we started discussing our baby names with my husband and we we continued in prayer um I remember there was also a fellowship that we had at our place we invited some of the young Brothers I remember it was brother brandham was there brother John was there brother Matthew M and they started sharing testimonies after testimonies and after they said a prayer for us in our home and I remember the atmosphere in that house I know that God heard that prayer because after just a little [Music] time I found out that I was expecting the day I found out it was just a shock to me at first I was in denial I couldn't believe I could even tell my husband until I went to confirm with the doctor and then we came and we I told him about it um after I discovered that I was expecting as the doctors always have something to say they told me that you have you know a lump on your side here maybe it might affect your pregnancy Maybe not maybe you might make it to fullterm maybe not so it it built a big fear in my heart and even though we were excited the devil came with fear in me telling me that I won't make it I'm going to miscarry the baby and I kept having dreams nightmares that I was losing the baby and I remember it was around the time that we went to Camp I think around three months um and we went and I was praying at the camp and I was like delivered from that fear so we thank god um that he gave us our son firstly I also want to say thank you to my husband because he was supportive of me the whole time he never once tried to stress me out he was always trying to encourage me and try to keep me calm I also want to thank God for our pastor for the ministers in our church for your prayers and for our encouragements thank God for our families both families who are always also encouraging and praying for us and also thank God for the church our church family because I know many of you were praying for us yes and we thank God that today we have our son [Applause] Shiloh so as we prepare our song um you can come forward for the special um the meaning of Shiloh is um a gift from God we got that that name in prayer one day brother brandham was talking about Shiloh as being the place where we received the blessing um and it's also meaning the promised one the Messiah is the place where Hannah and Hannah received her answer for Samuel so that's why we thank God [Applause] [Music] Merc [Music] [Applause]
