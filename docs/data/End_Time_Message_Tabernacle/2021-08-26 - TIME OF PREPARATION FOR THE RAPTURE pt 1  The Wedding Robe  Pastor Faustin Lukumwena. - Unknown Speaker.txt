never had really arrested repo you have a people pulling here invitation here here and there yeah sometimes it's very very hard to please everyone the first difficulty especially paris especially there are so many churches yeah boku degli zabari i have a lot of debt could they death but the last two trip i paid at least some amen at it's like all of us when we have a preacher coming in our city we want to listen to him you know what the denomination do services forum every five years they rotate pastors jacques sengal in fond la rotation de pasteur de la paris because they say this after five years people become used to the ministry and uh it's become like uh oh same same thing he said but we are not a denomination depending on some pain denomination and we cannot take that road in papua new guinea but the word told us every time you come to church make it like it's a new opportunity opportunity i was surprised even one day i was preaching to uh in shekinah we have to be consecrated and serve the lord regardless amen amen so um i have been uh i did not have a rest for a long time panda intercello uh sometimes you travel yada muma voyage you spend a lot of time this this this district but i'm praying so that god can give me grace this time to have really a place to rest asia joe young boys saying the girl and the mom you you travel what about us they never travel you know they know vayaspa the girls and the mom they like all the wedding parties but the boy they are not interested at all i have a promise this time i will go with the boys asia for me i don't know when but even somebody gave me five hundred dollars for hotel room uh you'll see amen amen so after service after your service i want to have a quick meeting with the young people who went to the camp in some of them they wrote to me they gave me their report i read them but i want to spend time with them so that we can go over their notes so that will be in the sanctuary after preaching cersei daniels and i will also ask the rest of the group to go spend time in the meantime in the basement when i walked in last night a kanji marshall the kitchen look really messy or la cuisina resemble the rest of the basement the chairs everybody shift the table since we had the last fellowship the rest of the the shares the the tablet would say they pick what is available so if you can uh we need to keep that place after we have a fellowship in order for the next fellowships foreign no interpretation and uh so that will be after service it's a service and uh next sunday god willing questions i will have a meeting with the couples especially the young married especially regulation marie i want to have time to speak with them you know even brother branham when he married people and foreign always went secretly to try to see how they are living is that right is that right brother david so when i come i'm not coming like a father-in-law no no i'm coming as the pastor if you call me pastor discreetly it's great now but um that's a parenthesis so say in parentheses but uh the purpose for the meeting objective is trying to help those young people who get married there are certain topics that we cannot address on the pulpit if you look in the message there are certain things that brother barnum has spoken yeah they say foreign which i want to extract from there and go a little bit in more detail you may not understand but that's the reality of reality people burn for marriage marriage married i was thinking it's like this and upon say come see i was thinking it was like this but now you are in the field meant now that's really shocked you are going to face certain realities and some of the realities yes attend this reality if it's not properly addressed it can lead to a big problem some of the problems can be solved just by a nice advice certain problem because sometimes even men and husband basketball wife and husband family even some who are already married for a certain number of years there is something there that you have to break between wife and husband to come to a the fullness of confidence that revere la plenty de la confidence that if there is something somebody i should talk to openly that's you see and vice versa vice versa if it's not if you don't know those things and i will also ask the old couples if you want to participate that's fine participation it may be from your experience some people can learn all yourself also you can learn experience i don't want to go in detail now so just be prepared for next sunday god willing if we can plan on ordering pizza this way we can talk easily they said manila on paper facility yeah because sometimes you marry people ask at the moment relation after five years a person come you will know that the very basic stuff they should have known they don't know and sometimes you see them having kids a performing boulevard but they don't know certain things in a south part that shows those who are married is that true say like somehow yes those who are married is that true yes is that true but uh yeah it's true so we trust that god is gonna help us amen amen and uh the following sunday after this coming sunday i will have to speak with the musicians so there was a notice here from uh uh coupon piano yeah i communicated you could play piano by the name sister sharon frede welcome after honeymoon and the brother never said my wife and i would like to thank our savior and lord jesus christ for making our wedding successful we would like to thank the pastor and the congregation for their endless support advice and the prayers they were very helpful and such a blessing for us may god richly bless you [Applause] yes before we turn to the preaching i thank you to appreciate another [Music] he told me his testimony and i thought it was very very helpful yeah it's gonna help somebody i forget to testify man let's smell the faith i want to do it for the glory of god when the pastor asked me to preach a word i was not feeling well remember i was very sick especially uh tuesday and wednesday la maniado maybe he could send someone to preacher that was a tuesday night then i started thinking how is it going to happen i just felt like i don't know if it's a voice or if it was a thought ella shows i didn't know and the thing said go preach and god would do something for you i had headaches [Music] and the morning of the morning of wednesday so nothing was working for me i was like should i call the pastor or not okay let's see the voila i just listened to that uh inner voice and i arrived if you notice it looks like i was coughing a little bit meh a prela predication but after the preaching i felt very good continuous and uh continue until sunday completely [Applause] [Music] amen [Applause] amen anyway if you could have called me wednesday i was not here. god you can see god sometimes in a very little things you may have your problems have a problem sometimes god allowed us a problem to show how great he can suffer must always depend on your inner voice and i believe god is still speaking and we have to have that sixth sense in the voices to tell you uh to see god in every aspect of life when something happened amen so i'm going to start this uh little series here you would recommend seriously that i'm going to speak on the time of a preparation for the rapture palestine and i will have the first part of the premier party that i will title the wedding job uh the wedding hope oh les there was a wedding robes different style the difference still different size different different thai et cetera a cd suite so the last series i preached the daniel it was on discerning times time and sign satisfied spoke about clay iran showing that the statute was completely destroyed so we have known all kind of signs we spoke about israel as a sign ladies and gentlemen we spoke about the seven visions that had in 1933 we are experiencing the big sign of the pandemic like the program since and then uh we saw kamala in the office who's ava vika malaki mr president uh can you project me that picture how many so pretty president biden falling on the stairs one day the president is not really in a good health the president nepal and mambon sante and this article said articulated the woman kamala harris camalaris may soon be the usa president joe biden will be forced to resign for health problems joe biden sergeant for sale the missionary cause the problem of the center are you with this at the vo of xc so they are talking about joe biden by then he was going on this the stairs and then he slides and falls and he stood up he said he fall down again almost three times prepare two for which kind of president occasionally done so soon will be a big it will not be a surprise since i suppose and some are talking about his mental condition something like that so if something happened to him automatically kamala will be the president of the u.s automatic montgomery deviantart daisy so this is the picture laying ahead of us and also you will see speaking about the corona virus biology called aviaris the way the disease started everybody was focused on the disease vocalization but the way we are standing today i think we start looking at the picture differently so it started with the disease it's a common service and the people praying for solutions solution and the solution came in now now we have a people who have been fully vaccinated with the two doses completely vaccinated those but we have heard recently they are talking about the third dose 120 who have received the third one yadda yadda does but if we go with the third for elsinoza vehicle attraction there will be a fourth you're in catherine now question yourself nadia mandevo what is this disease okay let's say maladie that in order to be cured you have to go to one two three number of vaccines i don't know you can say but lately in france it's a man first they are calling that thing um so that means before you go eat at a restaurant we will turn it three times in different restaurants no no and then my wife reminded me hey money we can use the vaccine we took two days ago to go visit the past and we are in the hospital and we took it that's where we were able to eat it but what's the point behind it you hope you cannot go to restaurant or restaurant without the vaccine some vaccine and the soon am i bientot and hope was telling me that i want to take a class but they said in order to be on campus you need to be vaccinated i'm not a scientist you're super scientific but i'm a preacher brother i think there is something behind those vaccines there you say vaccine up to this point up to this point uh just a point uh i'm not led to be vaccinated super conductor vaccine yeah and i'm still surviving the same god who healed me the moment i have a faith in him is your family but if it's the way god wants to take me home is my sister we will go but i will take that vaccine major progressive vaccine unless it becomes mandatory let me tell you the next target let's say what we do simpler portion now you cannot go to school now with the palladia call it's not the major it's in the past you cannot go to restaurants it's not the major personality problem the major is the problem a when do we say california you cannot attend the church then you become different all of these brothers and sisters to say foreign those signs that they were talking about you cannot sell you cannot buy you cannot do this it's visible it started like a a disease and then they say solution solution vaccine alone is only the solution only vaccine but to look at the direction the vaccine is taking when i regarded that direction that i cannot leave if you are spiritual she was a spiritual ah read between the line before learning and i'm not blaming those who are taking vaccine either like a friendly vaccine but you have to be to know what is taking place they would ever connect her sick is a person and i can tell you also this person from the disease de la maladey you know what to follow seki sweet it was cure cure cure but finally my final amount they injected something is all in shaytan people who don't have spiritual understanding lesion on pain comprehension spiritual they do stuff to blind them if on the shoulder you remember few months i was telling you i was completely completely against the stimulus but i think today everybody understand it everybody has seen the effects of the stimulus on the economy stimulation economy everything the price double we are now talking about four dollars a gallon in some spa the little stuff they used to buy for this match the price went completely up liberty what is the consequence is the stimulus say stimulus people are spend they have spent a lot of money now we come to a spot where announcement even the minimum wage mainly minima they used to pay people eight dollars an hour but now you cannot pay nobody eight you have to start at least 15 and up is available everything will go up and we are getting into a cycle in the sunshine and trade only circle and when they see price up it comes alive the governor will say we are going to increase the minimum wage minimum and then the price of commodities will go up the price of housing go up early the price of everything up it shows vague and then it's pushing in something that is alley to a point it's just a point where the government is going to give up we cannot afford this fare fast as you see because those who have a little theory of economy like young deputy economy the currency is based on gold la money that situation is called inflation the situation inflation and the contrary is deflation in a controversial deflation and the situation we are in is inflation illustration inflation prices are going up the prices are going up they pre-augment because the government passed but i can tell you this government has given a lot of money i'm not talking about the 1400 stimulus they give to individuals i can tell you this is something to make you sleep those who got the money they say lucky online those who got demanded stimulus package says stimulus and stimulus are the companies on the company the company has get associated millions and the situation is not going to get better soon it will come to the point where uh giving twenty dollars to somebody is nothing even now it's getting like to feel the tank is taking one hundred dollars maintenance within a week one hundred is gone we have to fill the tank pandala's men listen where are we standing it's a situation of crisis saturn situation decrees our only guard to help said magic penus a day amen amen brother bonham said let me read the quote here february taking the message oh lord just once more finally massage all seniors going for brother bonham said paragraph 178 on the paragraph uh this is a message that was preached in 1963 that means god is not surprised with the stimulus but god is has already won his people uh advertising we are living off of tax money that will be paid in 40 years from today you know where is at it says awesome no who got the money kia freelancer we haven't got it now vampire our uh our bonds are no good the language is using here the language literally you see people don't even understand it nationally he's talking about the bond what is the bond secularism their company they are the each company yeah they call the association when you buy shares you buy the ownership of the company so the company are taking debt company and printer and they're skipping down here and the church will loan the nation the money yeah uh yeah so go down please yeah so the uh the church is the one who got the money it's in eglise especially the catholic church special money he's catholic and uh in the message brother bonham said every bible reader can teach teach that in your church elector of the la bibla dance on eglise in the next quote uh lean not unto my own understanding cpa this country is bastard cpa for sure but don't look at the country but look at your own fairness to better understand this for sure but look at what how much money they give to foreign aides or we are going to help congo we are going to help this country we are borrowing on tax that will be paid in 40 years from now they tell me so they said on the life line down taxes we are spending now will be paid 40 years from now the task now the country we are 100 years behind the feminine elephant or some uh but that's about abandonment we use it that's it we are in the war of death for hundred years no someday they deadpool yeah sometime let me find it my little grandson if jesus tells the tax that he will pay when he is 40 years old we are spending on it now uh and our own indian and things starving to death you don't buy fellowship you don't buy a friend like me no but they are that's what they are doing no messi seki swan trend affair that's the way we are set up taxing people to everything they can get into demand attacks tax tax tax tax tax tax and we will not be out of war debt for hundred years yet and uncertain part they said girl the deadpool in period descent but more than we are in a war of debt you know something like the debtor not only for nations but mapula but you as individual voter individual man watch also your debt regardless you for death if you don't pay attention i want this i want this i want this you're very sick you will end up in a war of debt for 100 years but we know the sacred menus who is the money it's home but the churches melis themselves has become rich in san diego sierra except it's i accept us right i'll exception brother let me open a parentheses here it seems like we are not even able to pay for the building now people who contribute for the building they are very very limited we have asked you just for one hundred dollars a month to cover the mortgage the mortgage if i ask how many are paying brother you will be ashamed you will be surprised it's a commitment we took all together and we are sitting here you know we pay for the electrical bill electricity water toilet etc how comfortable you can be brother sister come on with the vettel comfortably first as well you never pay any penny and you say let anybody else do well this one will say let every any everybody else do it's not gonna work and how you will even feel comfortable addressing a prayer to god comfortably how comfortable are you getting money people who came here they say oh you have a nice sanctuary you have a nice place to complain if there is no word in the toilet we are going to complain senior padilla complained but who are you going to leave that burden onto me we dress well no perfume yeah nice cars like they're born over there but our duty as believers may not have the warranty we have to pay if i ask how many pairs brother it's a shame cj demand the combine pay for saturn want i can understand from time to time we may have problems we cannot it's understandable which kind of christian life are you living we are not forcing people for money for somebody because we know god will take care of and he has been taken care of but it's for your own benefit to to have your problem solved oh and then we are expecting to go into the rapture and we want god to help us you know i don't want really to talk about it go let's go back to this that was a nice parenthesis where is the code i was reading it okay so the churches have money earlier pretty near the wealth of the world say the bible appropriately la valor and that's why russia ran her out that's what we saw recently but the bottom line may uh lead my face oh thank you my my thought is my ponce this country is heading toward asking money from home cp level demand the more stimulus they will be generated yeah please invest the more this country is going to be broke and i don't know if you have heard this story one day enjoy you go you you do your tax refund the way you do the tax returns and they give you a paper we owe you forever the government is going to just give you a paper we owe you another it's like your child come to you say comfort my face give your voo i need this i need this you that come to the federal government but you will know that what i'm talking and what brother balam said is the absolute truth is even your million you have in the bank in your savings you will reach a spot you cannot ever access who's you are doing this you buy a lot of things it's not bad uh investigation but also they will see invest in the kingdom when they tell me we don't have money to pay for the place and uh we have to search somewhere to find the money and pay for example those who contribute efficiently see lucky contributor if you can smell god has a promise yeah you promise god will never owe you journey come on brother neville you did not take but the rest will never pay me amen but i think about this we have uh they told me sir we need to remind the church we need to remind each other say leave them alone but if out of 4 thousand that we have to pay the more to get utility insurance etc you may see on the wall they say that four thousand the carter utility only maybe five people paying one hundred dollars a month is where is it coming from but in the meantime it's also doing us good to invite other ministers to preach some we do pay the ticket for them we pay their hotel we feed them certainly i never asked the church we have a brother son so give the money so that we can give him an envelope our local ministers same thing no minister no code i'm sure they are doing their work before they travail we have to give them something to know they have also done so enjoy the sermon but you don't want to pay even more my business my faith amen amen but can you belong you also look at me otherwise it will be tomorrow if you come i put a bottom tape but no more visiting ministry you will be complaining but this church what are you doing for this church we start giving god the tips god doesn't need tips you take your engagement i don't know why i did not think about talking about this um amen amen how comfortable you will be even to bow your head to speak to god come on they never paid a title and offering since a long time so they don't know where to start from okay close that let us go to the message and the same problem is everywhere i travel i told them you know i can preach that don't think at your place a lot of education people probably they say they say what happened in my own church i am very shy because if i don't say it nobody else is going to do season 8 and tomorrow tomorrow you will be saying why you didn't tell us this so we could pay the water and everything because it's cut off no i think the holy ghost is going to help each one of you is your fault especially with a good mind so this area i want to go with is the time of preparation for the rapture preparation and in order to prepare ourselves objectively as i said on wednesday i will be heading toward the baptism of the holy ghost and showing the mark of the beast as well about them to send because we have spoken all kinds of signs of the scene but knowledge of science is good but that knowledge must produce preparations and we read the bible in the book of revelations chapter 19. in uh biblically libra the apocalypse verses seven and eight verses let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be erased in fine linen clean and white for the final linen is the righteousness of saints [Music] amen amen so that's the hope we are talking about may god bless the reading of the scriptures you may be seated the wedding robe how many know that the wedding hope is the baptism of the holy ghost that's what is taking place the sake is a past man and god has taught the church in many ways with a practical example of vectors example particle and when there is a wedding the bride less always comes with a white robe viento ju aveca in rob blanche we've never seen a wedding a bride coming with a yellow pink uh whatever color they have chosen nunavun [Music] they give you different colors but those colors are only for the decorations to dress the the bride made the no white paint but the pantalon blanche no no white skirt by the uh the ship launch but always a robe because it's the righteousness work of the saints basketball and you will see that rob said rob is always spotless at it have you seen a bride walking with a white robe they have evil deja vu in a pose martial viking of black will stain on the back blue yellow pink avec no spotless this is sometimes that's what the bible is saying in the last days according to ephesians 5 ephesians is what god has been working for all those years is he said that he might present it to himself a glorious church until remember in english glorious not having a spot no nepal detached but it should be holy and without the blemish do i present a song some blam and why now if i asked those recently married nasi she demanded six somalia sharon where is your uh white robe what uh what where is it huh sisterhood where's your white home of the closet i saw sharon white robe somewhere is in the house so that means we need that white robe it's a verdict based on the setup after i pray the but look at the effort that was made regardless you go to the closet you look at the hope and it closes the day i will be in leisure so that's showing that the mind of the bride is in the hopes so the mind of the spiritual bride is in the baptism of the holy ghost the spirit the spirituality that they but them do you send this today god is going to give me the baptism of the holy ghost you sent this prayer that's it takes a lot of work surface that the man you have to work for have to get that to work all the girls they totally fear they go find the best hope they can find you someone trained i'm looking for the best of the best so this is really what the church is after it says something in my second legislature a lot of effort therefore sleepless oh son so maybe they stepped all the years sleeping sleeping no sleep dude i want that hope but to look at all the effort may regardless therefore in one day that's enjoyed all the effort over there's the four sofini you take the robe dump it and the other thing about their wedding home eh you know [Music] i was teasing maybe with sharon you don't really thank you oh those robes are very expensive why don't you take julia oldham tell me the bride of christ needs a genuine baptism of the holy ghost the sentence not a second and hope i can show the second man everybody is longing for the right genuine hope yeah so the hope is what is really important in the salvation secretary amen amen so let me get into a parable here in the same one and praying daniel does see uh let's take our bible in the book of matthew chapter 22. then laylee for the matches you are gonna find some what i'm why i'm talking about the white house matthew chapter 22 matthew there was a parable you have been powerful that jesus spoke from the first verse and this is the core of my message and jesus answered and speak unto them again by parable and said jesus and you will see how brother branham interpret this parable for us the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king which made a marriage for his son [Music] god is that king and his way he's willing to make a body for his son jesus put some faces jesus and his son jesus has to have a bride a sophisticated developer in a puzzle and like every wedding party they come that shack fed to the mariachi you invite the people it was in vitalization but sometimes maybe four some of the mvps certainly and he sent forth his servant to call them that were beaten to the wedding and they would again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are beaten behold i have prepared my dinner my oven and my uh uh faithlings are killed and all things are ready come into [Music] wait a minute here go back to that first four just let me double check here they said dinner brother said here it's not a matter of dinner this is a prime problem the dna eat a matter of supper say them problem day it's a wedding supper it's not a breakfast it's nepali it's not a lunch it's a mother of supper uh satan problem day super next verse universe but they made the light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servant and untreated them uh spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was rough and he signed forth his armies and destroyed those murders and burned up their city every day then he said he to his servant their wedding is ready but they which were beaten were not worthy allah is therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both had both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came in to see the guests he saw that he saw there a man which had not a wedding garment and he said unto him friend how comets thou in higher not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then he said a king to the servant bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into the outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth hello it's about what is taking place with the wedding is so the king had a party for his son infected post office his son has to get married with a bride from this device in my awkwardness and then they noticed the party what's going on they add all the meat all the food already everything ready but i have to fly you have to fly i chose it everything was ready and then they allowed the it's like you start the service they come with come and sell your services those who supposed to be in the service they are not there the show's the machine he got mad you you say and then he sent the army like me no more the servant but he said the army and is killed others visitors you had to wait to the visitor and then oh yeah they started wondering why does this thing happen like this is a person come see so they keep asking they keep asking what's going on sometimes we are negligent to the invitation god is sending to us they found some negligence invitation and the brother said [Music] is explaining the way the wedding happened in the oriental the february speaker in oriental halloween when we invite the people to the wedding confidence you have to put somebody at the door you've never met i can't care la porter are you with me you have to put somebody at the door in calapoc you when you come in comfort veneer it's the person at the door who will give you your hope off with the wedding give up what i hope the mariach do you understand that not everybody coming the way you want the park so that when you get into the party guns and trade la fete you start looking at each other's clothes ah this one dress very well seriously this one is not very well this one is not very weird that's what people do in the the our side is a second legion they're not talking that's why in the time of the bible when we invite the people to the wedding with the invitation but those things are the type of the spiritual first sessions only tip of the spirituality number two one day we invite the people to the wedding comes in vitiligo it's the when god invite the people for jesus wedding can join with example it's god providing the hope and that to obey is the baptism of the holy ghost he said to blasted by them you sent us you have to enter by the door and the bible said jesus christ is the dog amen so everybody a child in order to get to the wedding party you have to have your white love develop what a robber and that white hope must be provided by god except for blasphemy which is the type of the baptism of the holy ghost just yelling deeply about them you said and everybody has to eat by the door now during the party may not pander as he send the people go grab the mvp did not show up elizabeth and then he sent a healing campaign the healing campaign only they gave his own yeah because they said because the nvidia did not show up come listen to some people go now look for the sick people my life their people now i'm going to give the opportunity to the rest of the people the restoration and the bible says good and bad amen amen so the good and the bad they came in after they seated the table i'll break his situation now the king started passing by every table i'll be the best by passing by every table and he's a job sure that everybody in the room was dressed everybody has the white robe and he finally discovered somebody if not my laptop with a different kind of coat avec uh the situation caught the vest then he went yeah see your son but over there somebody eat by the door and then jesus said hey take him bind him by the foot and then the enemies and amen i mean so that's what happened in the orientation so if it has to happen here you see every good a shack mario you must buy for the wife uh white wolf [Music] you go buy the dress for me we have to go back in the time of the bible the government's to buy for the hope because the group is the provider throwing the coat all the time the pastel that looks so good meant nasa god bless you your business this is the adoption time adoption let's go back to the the prophet they are still leaving them same custom that they did then continue now in this place now you see the way the example was made not matthew 22 gives a very good description of it description of the salah this is where we read matthew 22 i love only my traveling now brother is explaining to us that he said if you go to the eastern you go to israel then the bible become a new book because the way we read we understand the things here is different completely from the context of the bible and that's why we have a prophet he's a conservative that he said in the book of matthew call me didn't matthew vendee that there was a king who edison and rocky avenphis and he made a supper for his son felix that the king of heaven was having a supper for his son christ jesus kelly what jesus possible and if you would watch the setting as we try to dig into it and and find the setting the way they suffer and to be arranged it's a very beautiful picture of the coming of the son of god image defeats the deer and the wedding supper that we are all going to one of these days so that means the wedding is happening we are going into one of these days there is a door yeah important and there is a wedding we are born again of the

why not listen to the message you've heard okay we are here just to talk a little bit so concentrate to listen to the message to the messiah that's the most important thing the last show is amen amen and when you say amen become vegetarian you are being receiving god there is a what you done amen amen sometimes rather when we come we have to be very very concentrated because three concerns like sometimes it disturbs the preacher so uh let me go to the scripture god's provided way love [Music] that's the reason why everybody come here for their purpose you can visit objective and that's the main thing there will be little interaction to strengthen some people but you come also for your own son first he found one there without a wedding garment why that's very typical in the oriental times that's the way it is in this affair too the wedding serpent we are going to let them know nobody is going to bring their own hope this young person and then [Music] there because sometimes without the baptism of the holy ghost the basket the first sentence you will always compare yourself with others oh that one is doing this mistake he says lafay et cetera and that makes you a little bit bigger it's a loving people that one is doing that mistake make you feel good but with the baptism of the holy ghost they have witnesses if they have witness weaknesses or is available you have also your weaknesses for faith blessings therefore alone you will not focus on other people's weaknesses for of people without the holy ghost and they saying they chance and they sent this prayer but

time to say to them that we're biden come for all things we're now ready and they will and they all with one consent began to make excuses and i'm going to talk about the excuses excuse me because the

been given the invitation first it was invitation and you have returned the invitation for whatever excuse excuse me the bible said that before 24. none of those men which were bid and shall taste my supper are you with the bible the invitation is given it could have been a good thing for you never to touch this message but once you have taken this message may you have a prison message god said this gospel a jedi can set eventually we will be preached everywhere nobody will find any skills brother it's a time of preparation first attempt we have to adjust ourselves to the world what does this person deserve i guess the sex person may read it he deserves death in the merit lamoni you have 500 women all family and you leave them alone you went after ah bathsheba there yeah if the sentence would be what you said see like this just again you deserve death to merit lamar mercy oh lord there will be a record mercy only for me human being if god has to judge us by the way we are see nobody will interpret myself personally except but if they judge by the other person she is not a person nobody will enter including you but that person yeah remember a man amen now this three kind of group say as we read this second paragraph here this empire policy in the message is your life worthy of the gospel paragraph 33 32 the there was three pools or three turns of it there was a three group of people the first group the premier group is he sent the the the servant to call the mvps and the mvps did not show up if they refuse let me target the second group the same one now uh siblings and the second group was to go get the crippled the blind and those etc and then of the good and the bad uh the the good and the bad they bought the movie so identify yourself from which group you come from the bad and the good liber [Music] so they went out uh a healing campaign he saw a lot of particular campaign they gave his own went out to get the blind and hacked some people of our lives are regular and still they were home so he went out to compel the good bad and indifferent they should come in here now you read another paragraph of this [Music] amen amen matthew 22 matteo vendor and look here and he continues can you continue if you would read it later on computer i drew this subject from there is your life worthy of the gospel it is and anyone who refused the invitation a name portuguese regardless of the group you come from very importantly you can your life is not worthy of the gospel eventually the life worthy of the gospel the virginia deliverance when stop all right gives one the first above but if you do anything contrary to see what kind of shows the controversy i have to finish what i'm doing first defending the double second finishing what i'm doing if you need a box that becomes even a routine premiere you can go to the store the store valet or shop you buy a fish that stay in person you open the same amount of money needed for your rent montana but the reason why we don't want to see we don't have those testimonies is [Applause] saying yeah let's set yourself up that god is unable to provide enjoy it and it comes with you as long as you put yourself first god will remain behind instead of your body god with his invitation the important focus regardless of your situation an important situation god come to the challenge of defeat understanding before investment development amen amen and there will be another book of acts right not uh but today we are putting our excuses of all kinds of excuses oh my work said oh my my body paragraph 34 uh paragraph [Music] it's his supper and his invitation invitation but man is constantly making excuses nom continue have failed his excuses and if you read the saint matthew 22 22. you will find that today's excuses were made there also you are not the first one to make excuses and your excuse is not the most important it was important it went back into all ages in every church age people who oh because i did this basket your face oh i got a new [Music] god is still standing they just say oh i just get married do you pray animal means even to pray more and then after the millennium right after the millennium mr president right after animals you better be prepared for the veteran it doesn't mean that god is on vacation it doesn't mean god is on vacation it's time for me to relax in the lord it's an individual affair fair individual brother this time first saturn is the time of preparation the preparation brother we don't prepare as a group is an individual individual i'm closing with the sudden secret going away of the church jefferson secretary student delegates program of 28. paragraph went to it brother bonham said i appreciate that in you or the american world whatever it is but it takes more than a good message from the pulpit mesa message it takes your life sapon for travis it takes you to get ready with the man the death of prayer in revelation the 19th chapter and the seventh verse navier peter versus said speaking of the bride of christ parlande les de crist she has made herself ready she made herself ready and you a torah as a member of this bride a time man but they said you have got to make yourself ready brother we are coming here friend of the night in the light of all those events the rapture is at the door it takes really preparations all the signs that is your preparation faison in clear preparation and the branham continues continue he wasn't a pastor in a taper in pastel you can't expect your pastor to do it you have got to make yourself ready for prepare for me it's an individual affair in a fair individual it's an individual affair individual as we are coming to this spot i look in something we want the people to be ready to restore the prayer meetings you say when was the last time we had the prayer meeting the time is getting close we need to be on the move we need to get back to those experiences experience amen amen paragraph 32 but they say oh if you say brother we are going to meet only sunday for 30 minutes everybody is fine my country friends but that's not the preparation because god is intending for you that's not what conditions need to lead you into the rapture you have a peace to do yourself with a very faithful man the adjustment of your schedule is yourself getting rid of your uh secondary activity is yourself and the reformation is not only about even schedule anyway jesus is coming jesus yeah and great wonders are being done negroni and it will happen in a moment it's about arriving how are we standing this morning as we take inventory preach on inventory here very very shallow precision no long time ago it's the sign of preparation they sent you the preparation are you taking inventory of your own life with the vehicle fell in vancouver whenever god called me first when i received they talk about adjusting entry yeah you have to adjust your book according to the physical inventory vote reliever confirming so you have to adjust your life according to the book of the bible would defeat as you step out of your conformance you have to take inventory with the very preferred inventory and not to put yourself oh i am in the church of the united states oh i'm in the church oh yeah the church has nothing to do negligence listen to the brother branham you could tell your prophet paragraph 36. i want to tell you a little story that i've read years ago in the that's the period elbow i'm going to skip that go to now 11 uh now yeah i'm going to skip this middle of paragraph 36 now maintenance all the debt will not go in christ will be under god's wrath and divine judgment the only thing is god guys they they still shows say like they say please don't let that happen to you no matter what the random tabernacle ever turned out don't even have your eyes on the bottom of there will always be you be a servant of christ not up to the tabernacle neither it is up to any other churches it's up to you as an individual individual to be ready at the coming of the lord death of prayer life a new decision you must be ready to pray i must be ready to pray i sweep my own steps it's up to you to sweep your steps leave mine alone me leave yours alone marvel they say useless you have forgot to make your garments ready for be praying amen amen that's the main thing today people get a lot of confusion in their minds which is the baptism of the holy ghost you will get the power of the battle you will get the baptism that never happens to the time of preparation from [Music] and that's what this preparation is about you can change churches if you don't change yourself it will transfer to a church changing it's like men changing addresses you will still remain the same remember i've seen a brother jeffy and friend in the message that's a message he changed the church he last changed please hey he moved he died he went to jeffersonville oh pastor pastor i got the car and the brother joseph prayed for the car yeah after a certain oh make your steady a forfeit of preparation bread and then we will continue with the other type of preparations when you do a real preparation very tableau paper it's like that woman in the bible second set from the bible when she realized a piece was missing she took a book the rapture will take place am i going to do i have the white robe oh i am a bride mate i'm here accompanying the bride yes i say my amen i pay my tithe i pay my offerings just for one break it's just a poor insulin think about you can call the church any name fair poverty listen important people are changing the name of the church it doesn't do anything marion what is more important you in christ doing a constant inventory so the white robe is the real baptism of the holy ghost and i thank god by god's grace in that direction direction to wake up people poop over revelation to start seeking the real baptism and if you said i got the baptism there a way to check yeah number one you know make sure that's your review which kind of holy ghost you can challenge this oh i received the lord only caused a long time jerusalem the holy ghost never even forgive anybody you do something to me you know me for a long time i don't like this thing i cannot bear that that god forgave yes as forgive about those always ready to forgive you prayer regardless of he doesn't await different sins and you can check it yourself you put your face over me how do you react maybe that person said do a certain experience other guys maybe he killed your son he killed your daughter maybe you are only begotten maybe they are only begotten uh joseph is satanic speech questions that's a question about holy ghost sentence regardless of you forgive me brother pardon my father father i forgive you with all my heart the flesh depends on your tumor care even before you ask for forgiveness there is no bitterness in your body the heart where the holy ghost dwells for which god forgive me every day god forgive me and when god forgive me the bible said that people you have to forgive others that's not the holy ghost that means you receive something different the holy ghost is the deity in you god in you if god forgives you forgive yourself forgive your husband that's the evidence that's an if you dance that came into my mind i said give me the money ah god is your life worthy of the gospel i don't know i think paragraph 62 something a paragraph sunday evidence of the holy ghost leave you dance with yourself you have to cope with every word just type uh cope with uh the word love your enemy that's what that kept just in my mind so that's the evidence of the holy ghost that's a levity don't be confused that's why confused if you are not sure it's the genuine baptism of the holy ghost you will not pass through the battle sentence through a certain experience that passed by certain experiences it's an invitation look for the without the sensation sun sensation and you know the story of uh george smith we're going to say started with me and the way george smith took uh the old guy here the pastor peregrine uh josh smith they went to pray and then he went through that experience without a real experience first of all experience your your baptism of the holy ghost oh what about but then you sent us pray is it still questionable amen amen yes if it's the word parallel and the god says so i didn't see the spirit in you will cope with that word every time they have accepted the power of what are you willing to if you have the holy ghost you will not argument with the word the word says you pay your tithe you pay your offering to give me your is life and the spirit vasquez and jesus said my words are life i'm a powerful lover and if you have got eternal life it comes and he is the word what kind of a person would make god can john the person who failed that's one thing to know that you are a christian when you can fully agree with every word of god amen they don't love you yeah you still love them only the holy ghost can do it the male sentence wikipedia no man can do it okay
