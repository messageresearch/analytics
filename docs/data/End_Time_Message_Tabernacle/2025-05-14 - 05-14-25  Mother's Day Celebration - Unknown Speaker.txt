========================================

Welcome the visitors. John and Chris. May God bless you. Oh. He's coming from Welcome. [Music] We have also greetings from Sister Keta from South Africa. request for myself. So, brother Caleb want to ask the church for their prayers as I'm going out of town. God bless you. That's Caleb Gonzalez. And uh today is a special day for the mother. How we appreciate the mother. Every life that came on earth is through the mother. And mothers are a big asset in God. And we want the mother to realize their level of responsibility. As the world is celebrating Mother's Day, we don't want this to be a tradition that they bring flowers, they cook for us like we did. Really, uh, God put this in my heart. prepare those meals for our sisters so that they can cook 364 days. I say 364 days. Yeah. For one day like today, we are going to cook for them. And we did and I want really to appreciate all the brothers. So each one of them they were in the cooking team. They spent all day yesterday cooking on the plantin and all these things. Sister, where is brother? Huh? What? In the kitchen cooking today. So that sister Mali, God bless you, sister. So Uh sister just bear with us. We did not we are not perfect but take it as a act of appreciation for you an act of love. So the rest of the brothers who did not cook when we go downstairs try to serve I don't want to see a sister touching anything they are going to sit like a queen they are saying if the pastor was like every day the church will be better. So it's not going to be a habit, but we did something special for you on your special day. But I believe the brothers have done a wonderful job. to the extent I saw a lot of food and I'm going to apologize for not cooking the food because we have already a lot of food. Seems like really they like me to cook. But I did cook what you are going to eat soon. Which one you prefer? Natural or spiritual? Both. I was assisting brother Caleb in the kitchen yesterday. So it's just a act of appreciation. And uh also as men living in America, is not too late to try to to learn how to fix something. It's not too late on some days. Brother, we can also wake up earlier and fix the breakfast and bring to your wife in the bedroom. No. Amen. Yeah. We can do those things just to show our appreciation. Amen. Amen. Sometimes I take for granted the Christian mother who is there. The mother who has raised me, who gave her love and care. The mother who helped me grow in a fine Christian home. The mother who has taught me with God, we're not alone. Amen. The mother who has laughed with me when all was going well. The mother who w has picked me up the the times that I have failed. A mother I didn't appreciate until I was fully grown. The sacrifices she made for me as time quickly moved along. The mother was with such crest and faith that helped me from the start. The mother who I love and cherish and treasure my heart. Life is of surprises. There a lot in store. We only have one mother, one I adore. You gave me lots. You help me out. Step in when things went wrong. Oh, mother dear. I have to cheer. I'm so happy I could sing you a song. There was only one on this earth. You deserve first prize. You brought me up, gave me love. You held me when I cry. Now it's your turn, dear. This is just to say I will always love you, mother. My love grows more each day. [Applause] This is a quote from um Willin Mavian Bunham um um from the the invasion of the United States 1954. Respect and honor you there with your your red roses on your mother. If you want your mother, if you want to do anything for her, do it, do it 365 days a year. Go to her house and offer and offer her a prayer and live for God. That's the thing to do. And bring your child children. And when your children come up, they'll call you blessed. Amen. After you have passed on beyond the veil that the real spirit of motherhood, the real spirit of Mother's Day. Mother's Day is 365 days a year. Don't forget Mother's Day should be every single day. Happy Mother's Day. Thank you. Certainly when we see the children saying those kind of words that make us feel good. So that means in return we have to take care of the little ones in the Lord and to the mothers. Uh I don't want to preach on uh a sermon on the mothers like I did last year. But I want just to say one thing here. In the Mother's Day message, 89, brother dedicated a whole sermon for the mother on that mother. He said this then we shall see him. Then we shall be like him. Then we shall worship him. Then we shall see mother as God wants her. How does God want to see mother? Amen. Amen. Then we shall see mother as God wants her. Mother would not be complete there without her family. No mother. So do you understand this? If you mother, you are planning to be in heaven, which is a wonderful thing. But said, you will not be complete without your family. What a statement. So that means as a mother we should not taking the children lightly. Every child of yours over there when we will sit at the table a mother will be happy. God you gave me 10. I count all the 10 around the table and they say without her family. That means You have to have also your husband. What a responsibility. So mother is the backbone of the family. Brother said if there is a credit you should give to the braham family don't give it to me give it to me. So even Brham gave all credit to his wife. And this morning as men we have to give credit to our spouses. Even as ministers without a wife, the ministry is down. How important women are. Amen. Amen. And continue cause the greatest time of all of her life is to see the children around the table. [Music] And to see her pour the coffee and whatever she does and fix his supper and her and dad sit down. Why that's the happiest time in mama's life? see her kitties all at home. Even though this is America, as a mother, try to direct your prayers to keep your children home despise of their ages. Oh no, I'm 18. I'm out. Responsibility of the mother. And brother Bam said now don't miss don't be missing that day. Mother don't miss and your children your family to be present. Let the great chain of your family be hooked together link by link. Amen. Amen. That's the responsibility of mother. Let every spoke be in the will. And then when we sit down with our families and groups across the canopies of eternity, what a day that will be. Then we will understand So I think this is summarize everything I could have preached for the mothers. There is an appointment somewhere. Mother, you must be there. Don't miss and be there with your family. And uh may God richly bless you mothers. That's my sincere prayer. I love you all. Appreciate you for the way you are taking care of your families. Not only that, each one of you has spent more than nine months with a child inside. You go through hard times. Sometimes you could not eat, you could not sleep because of that life that is inside you. Pain after pain. But there is a joy once you deliver. But the joy is not going to stop there. Is to see that child growing and taking responsibilities. And for the children as we speak for the pain of the mother, honor your mother, you may not realize the pain they endured for you. But I'm always talk about the story. Uh the heart of the mother is on the babies. even on animals. You see, you see a gorilla, with a baby and a hunter come with a gun, want to shoot gorilla will save. Look at the baby. You hunter, you don't have a heart. If an animal can think like that, but today, mothers, we have babies. What do we do with them? We leave them somewhere even unattended, unattended, such supervision to go look for money. said in one of the message what those dollars are going to do for you. And tomorrow we talk about juvenile delinquency. So that come also a responsibility for us men to make sure that we work hard to take care of the need of the family without necessary to see the mother going to look for money. So all of these come together as a family that want to see in heaven. Amen. Amen. Uh he also talk about a story. A mother was uh outside and left the babies in the bedroom and suddenly the house start burning. But there can be a lot of wives, women, they will just stand outside. to see how the house Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Because that baby that is inside is not there. But the the mother who the baby was inside flame after flame, she could not stand. me standing here looking at the house burning and then after going collect to collect the ashes of my baby I will not tolerate if I have to die I have to die so that mother went inside everywhere the flame burning her and then she found the baby she took a blanket wrapped up the baby and tried to find her way out. She was burned everywhere but for the sake of one a baby and that can be you, you and I, many women they conceive but they could not keep the pregnancy. They could abol and you could not be here. But look at the sacrifice. And then she came out with the baby burn everywhere. They have to take the piece of her skin to patch the [Music] face. She was a very beautiful woman but she came she became ugly. Few years later, the child went to school and say, "Mama, I'm coming on vacation." When the mother was waiting for the baby at the train station at her friends, they say, "Oh, look at that ugly woman. But that child, she knew the story and the train uh driver don't know how they call that who knew the story. She saw the behavior of the baby, the child. When the mother was coming, oh, welcome, welcome. Do I know you? And the train driver said, shame on you. You can never deny that mother. If she's ugly, it's because she did a sacrifice to save you. So brother, sisters, we are children. We have to respect. Respect mean respect. No one time your mother tell you to do this. Never. Never. Unless it's against the word of God. Amen. Amen. As she is getting older, help the mother. I always tell this to my children. Did you see what they've done for my mother? for more than I don't know almost 25 years now she that's why it takes young boys who you are going to marry because some women they will stand and tell in this house. You have to choose between me and her and you know what the mother the man cannot do otherwise. But if you have a wife who can accept your mother give more credit. Amen. Amen. So I have to stop here for the motherwise I will give Amen. So, the sisters have a special song, right? Yeah. I wanted them to sing when I'm on the platform if they can help. I don't know who.
