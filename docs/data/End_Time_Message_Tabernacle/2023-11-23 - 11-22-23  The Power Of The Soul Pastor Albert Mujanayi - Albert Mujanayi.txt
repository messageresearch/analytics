from you bless our pastor bless the church in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen may be seated just in visit it was just a short [Music] visit I want to thank you all for the time that we spent together starting with the house of our pastor for everything they've done for me yesterday I was invited by the couple Emanuel I think I had I had five more pounds brother brought me a gift this morning a lot of love may God richly bless you if God allows it tomorrow I will be leaving this city I will go and join my daughter I want to renew the invitation to the pastor you know for his invitation to come really accept it just to be just you know it's not just for us to come to visit youch it's good also to come visit as there small place for you guys there upon the trees you know Sunday I thought about speaking about something else and uh my spirit was coming to what I was talking about on last Sunday and we just uh waiting upon the Lord I was reading the prophet and the prophet said one of the fundamental reason that we see no more going on in the church because there's not enough traveling of the Soul to bring the person in contact with his [Music] maker the progress of the church is uh linked to the traveling of the souls I know you know the scripture that say you have to prosper in any ways as the state of your souls [Music] Prosper the progress that we can have in our life is linked to the progress of our souls the one that wrote the Book of Revelation prison he was physically as a prisoner in the uh island of Patmos [Music] well he said I was caught up in [Music] spirit and said that he was caught up into that vision for almost two [Music] [Music] years physically was in the island of Patmos but he went to the days of the Lord it wasn't he was still there physically in the island of [Music] Patmos surrounded by all the snakes and scorpions but Esau was caught up very far that he could see the thing that we seeing [Music] today when he was caught up in spirit when his soul was caught up in higher spheres he saw the throne he saw what was happening in heaven he saw that great prostitute amen he even saw the United States before United States could come into reality do you [Music] know he saw that lamb was talking like a dragon [Music] he started slowly talking Slowly by starting to Marvel the world and brother says that that was United States they're able to bring down fire from heaven those [Music] are [Music] yes John saw all these things before United States was created he saw the bride he see the opening of the seals while the opening of the SE was supposed to happen in the last days what happened that was the soul that was caught up physic physically was blocked [Music] but spiritually was in great spheres I want to tell you you can be here but you can concentrate yourself you can lift up your soul and you can go to Great spheres and see great things it's just up to you to think about those I want to talk about something that we reserve ourselves to talk [Music] about let me tell you that before God created the world he has to think about it that's what the prophet says amen the prophet say he started to think about how things were supposed to happen he he didn't have another word that he wanted to copy that word [Music] from but it was his own thoughts when he T when he thought about it he spoke the word and what he had in his thoughts became a reality amen God has to call it soul up amen and you can call your own soul up and you can bring things into existence because for our Prophet what we think thinking about that's what's happening to us amen I don't know if you believe it amen even the angels why the church doesn't see many angels because the church doesn't think about them but if you're thinking about those angels the angel will appear to you the two disciple on the road of they were talking about Jesus and Jesus came to towards them let me tell you and bring him out of the seven Dimension and come near you it's a power that we incarnate amen yes sir Hallelujah but that exercise that exercise to think about those things to cut up your souls those things that's what the church is not really where it's supposed to be may God help us I I feel like I want to say something I didn't want to say it you [Music] know a man can recreate his wife just with it with her soul mayor with his soul he can think about a wonderful woman or better woman and every single time is actually directing his touch towards it the same way that our thoughts can bring God out of his Dimension and bring him near us the same way that God's thought that's what brought the world into [Music] existence and you can bring a wife according to your own thought even your children that's why we are not allowed to talk with our children or treat them as a ambel because they're going to become what we thinking about them amen yes sir even the church here you becoming what the pastor think of you amen every time when he prays he has an image of what the church [Music] is that's the anting that transmits it can take time I'm just taking talking ordinary if you go to a church where the pastor always does this you say all the church will do this as well yes sir I believe that it if you come to B you're going to see me you're going to see towards the behavior of believer you see oh this is Pastor Albert you see like me I don't know how to speak like a priest if I want to talk like a priest I want to respect the [Music] I want to control all the words I'm a a little bit like a Savage white uh even my church every time they shout that's how they are there's a power that transmits there's a power to transmit from our souls and we can bring into existence numbers of [Music] things Jacob was thinking about his and he was thinking about he was reing and a certain time he had the better spiration because he was aspiring to become a boss and he became a boss amen I'm talking to you as adults right now fish instead of go and fish uh get some fish for you they can help you to become a fisherman that's my true thought amen our existence also has the power to go out and think about something and bring into existence uh that's why we established I think you didn't forget it's with the prophet that our souls were created the day that God created a man to his own image you have to exclude your thoughts you have to exclude in your thoughts that that day it was only Adam that was created but say it's between the lines he didn't say let's create a man he said create man to our own image it's the day that our souls were created you believe that our souls were existing before we exist into this uh body we even assist God or help God while he was creating the Earth God was not alone we were around God as the Gathering and we saw our father create the [Music] Earth and we even clap our hands amen God never forgot that but in this body sometime we forget it then based on that we are able to speak like Jesus and to tell the father father glorify me of the glory ahead near you before the foundation of the world we are able to say the same thing because when God created your soul he gave him glory he gave it a commission and the commission was to rule over to dominate and when I see things going wrong I can concentrate myself in my soul tell God oh Father glorify me of the glory I had near you when before the foundation of the world and things can changed amen praise God it's a revelation amen it's a revelation and for tonight I want to keep that same to show you something or uh what make the SWS to be caught up I want to ask you something but you don't have to [Music] answer I think that with everything that I talked about here you agree with [Music] me that before the existence of my body my flesh my soul was existed already not just that my soul is in [Music] activity before I even came to this world as a baby in Christ amen even when I am in this flesh my soul is still working even when I will be out of this flesh even when this flesh will end my soul will continue working amen if you agree may you lift up your hands amen this flesh cannot block my soul my flesh can see a certain way but my soul can see in another [Music] way and the soul is working before the existence of the body while the body is existing and after the body will end ET because say our soul that's our Eternal part it was never said to our souls that you are dirt and you go back to dirch that was taken from that that was said to the body am it's to the body that they gave the promise that you start it and you have an end that was never spoken to the soul my soul is working even if this body ends Amen Let me give you a few examples here in the United States say somewhere I don't know there were an accident and there's a a guy that had a court yes and uh he was uh it was in the accident the car came and ran over him and he died INX and they saw in the same place many times and many years someone driving his car and he sees a man uh walking or crossing the road with that the [Music] coat and he will run over that man and that person will actually get out the road and you say oh I ran over someone and when that person gets out of this car even when your your police came and they don't see the person that was run over by the car but the person saying I ran over someone and the police realized and they ask how was that person it was still the same man that person was already buried [Music] but he was appearing the same place and the same way who is that person Sam Samuel he existed and Samuel died amen yes sir is day and Israel organized a funeral Sam was dead and one day so was uh in trouble heaven was shut to him and consult Witchcraft and notice before all the sorcerers they had the [Music] ability to go and contact the dead yes in other words the dead were not really dead yes sir and they could bring those people back I'm saying before the cross of Jesus before the the blood of Emmanuel was uh shed people had the possibility to bring back someone who was who was [Music] dead and Saul knew that and God forbid and told them to not do that and has the the heaven was shut off for when I consult that sorer he said bring me someone that I want to tell you his name his name is Samuel but s was already dead he was already buried and the woman did all those things and Sam was brought back to the dimension that he was and that woman say I'm seeing a God that's being lift up from from Earth and that's where brother says death doesn't change the nature of a person and the God that was being lift up from Earth he was Samuel and Samuel and Sam was not a fiction then he was a real person who was a cloth amen yes sir who where those clothes came from that Samuel on him Hallelujah because the cloth that they Buri Samuel were not existing anymore but where did Samuel brought his cloth and it was a real person that was talking and he was a prophet as he was before he died he was the same prophet he even reminded sa to what he told let me tell you even though all the stores are closed God is able to close you [Music] amen I don't know if you being lift up with me Jes Jesus and saw a crazy person there in the cemetery and he healed him and the Bible said that they found this person with his good senses he was well [Music] clothed where did those clothes come from let me tell you don't cry Hallelujah God is able yes to give you exactly what you need from nothing something can be come up can come up amen do you trust the Lord I want to tellest someone tonight I don't know your needs but if you trust God where there's nothing God will create hallelujah praise God amen amen say to yourself when there's nothing God will create God is not blocked God is not limited where there's nothing God recreates hallelujah even though you don't have even though the medicine say you don't have say to yourself where there's nothing God will creat and he can create the hallelujah amen that's the reason why a ster woman doesn't exist in the eyes of God even according to Medicine it is impossible that you can conceive when there's nothing God Rec create thank you Jesus Christ hallelujah praise God am it's that Samuel it was real Samuel it wasn't a fiction he spoke with sa and he told him a prophecy he told him tomorrow you will be joining me you're going to die you're going to join me here I don't know if you if you catching it they're going to kill you are you going to be with me that means that death it's not the end hallelujah praise God a real Samuel and the old person he came as the old person it was before the cross Hallelujah yes sir I hope you catch me is it good amen but who is that Samuel hallu because the Samuel in his with his body he was there buried in the Tomb but there were always a Samuel Prophet who was still living it was real if that will get your spirit you won't even be afraid of death Hallelujah am death is nothing thank you Jesus Christ who is that Samuel it's his soul because a soul can take any form amen a man speaking expressing himself but keeping his nature amen amen amen amen I want to take tell you something be uh pay attention hell and then the Bible [Music] says when John was caught up in spirit his body there in the island of Patmos [Music] he went to the dimension where all the dead found [Music] himself and John saw the souls under the altar amen not the body under the alar but SS Under The Altar and the SS were speaking amen and those Souls were shouting saying until when they were talking to God until when will you uh will you be late to Revenge our blood until when Lord until when real people amen Souls they were talking says Theologian called them the bride the Bride of Jesus who was asking for Revenge until when until when said through their language I knew that he wasn't the Bride of Jesus Amen because death doesn't change the nature of a person and that was concerning the Jew because the Jew they don't know any other thing the Revenge yes sir that's the teaching that they got they became what they've been taught for the teaching of Moses Eyes For Eyes teeth for teeth yes that that was Moses that's why I'm saying you becoming what you hearing amen you identif you are identifying yourself with the teaching he said he couldn't be the bride if he was the bride she could speak another another way hallelujah what kind of language the the bride could have said he said father forgive them hallelujah amen yes sir am oh la I'm reaching a certain part a point and uh really do something bad in people's hearts he said it couldn't be the [Music] bride the bride was coming from materials that came from the uh the the groom amen when the groom was at the cross they uh they wounded [Music] him blood and all this came from his and say whatever came from his side that what was forming the bride and what was the Sha of the groom window those materials was coming from he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing amen the same word that's speaking about the groom they're talking about the bride as [Music] well and I'm amazed that among us there are people still with the teaching of of Moses do you understand what I mean in people's houses they know really well the book of Chronicles the teaching of Moses I don't know if you really understand what I mean the book of Chronicles it's the book of counting example we've we got married in 2000 it was in June in September you insulted me the first the first book of Chronicle now the second in January 2001 you beat me in March you insulted me and then we go out from the book of Chronicles when we were married in the June just the first night you disrespected me and a generation like that they will lose their identity and they will find themselves under the book of the New Testament and then you don't have a place there they recognize the Jew through their teachings they were claiming vengeance but when we change the Testament Hallelujah there's no more Vengeance amen praise God I want to tell you it's not just Jesus himself who say father forgive them even uh uh Steven yes even St in the New Testament they were stoning him he said father forgive them hallelujah thank you Lord amen amen Jesus came he said you were told you were told but I'm telling you hallelujah praise God love your enemy Hallelujah do good to one that do wrong to you amen then I'm think I'm asking myself death will not change the nature of your soul amen you're going to go through shouting as your soul the the nature of your soul was I really want I don't want to deal with people from the Old Testament tonight please amen that means that you and me until death until death you and me I just thought you until death is it the bride no sir that's not the bride amen that's not the bride the bride has another language amen I don't want to talk uh you know confuse you more [Music] you know life is made the way that we always find ourself as uh in the the map of Jesus look Jesus was at the cross he had a teeth in his uh left side he had another teeth to his right side the tee on the on left it was against him says you know uh other than those three crosses they had another cross that was the cross of Judah it was Judah who brought Jesus to the cross of golgatha they had four crosses two against uh three against two against one against Jesus two out of three and one just was for him amen amen those proportion Came From Heaven even in heaven amen the devil took two3 and God only remained with one and that's how life is made up for a Christian you have a lot of enemy adversary then the friends amen and throughout among those things you have to show who you are am sometime I even P myself and the servant of God you see an announ of God Who's Crying in front of his church oh they don't love me and all the church oh we don't we don't love our pastor what are you imagining yourself he has to be hated amen as is as is waiting to be loved two3 two of three has to be against him and only one third has to tell him be courageous I feel like and that's how life is made up and that's I'm coming back to my thoughts death it's not the end of the soul the soul will still have activity or continue working as he was doing in his flesh that's why it will be behaving after the the flesh will end that's the reason why when Jesus died the Prophet The Prophet says in the message burial he says paragraph 131 after the message tonight that great inment that's the the the the day he talked about the [Music] inment he never laid silent yes after his did they uh buried the man yes when Jesus was uh was dead they took his body they buried him that's brother [Music] says and after the message tonight that great inment he never laid silence silent amen went right on into the [Music] regions and finish the work of God that he was ordained to do amen even when they buried Jesus it was the body that was buried but his soul amen went to finish the work of God that he was orain to do amen what he couldn't do with his flesh Hallelujah he saw continue to finish the work hallelujah amen even though my body is blocked my soul will [Music] continue and will finish the work that God gave me and ordained me to do just pay attention here I'm just going to think about something little touch here and I'm going to be done in the regions we know he went and spoke to the [Music] souls and he went and free all those saints that were in paradise and that paradise doesn't exist anymore and that kind of revolution revolution I myself I know [Music] from from the cross it's not possible for a sorcer to come in contact with My Soul that was possible before the cross Jesus came to end all those uh those link he did it let me take this a work and I want to stand on it says he say uh inment you know when they Buri [Music] Jesus amen here we see Jesus [Music] died and when they buried him he didn't stay silent while he was buried he took my sins away away very far he took the sin Beyond Resurrection Hallelujah if you can just do me a favor tonight my brothers Jesus that was dead he was working amen yes [Music] sir he was doing his physical death that he accomplished a great work favoring me amen favoring you [Music] because what was hindering the saint in the Old Testament to go in the presence of God was because of [Music] sin Jesus came to take sins to bring to bring it back to the original owner who was the devil and he fulfilled the work while his body was lay dead it's through his soul Hallelujah says in the Old Testament they were using two goats for the atonement they had the Lord's book goat they have the they are the goat for AEL and when the people came to for the atonement to confess the sins they were killing the goats for the Lord for the atonment of sin and they would take all those burden all those sin and they would pouring that to the the other goat and the other goat was going away and when he was going far away that means the sin was going away away from the sights of gods Jesus was represented to those two Gods he played the role of the book of the Gods of the Lord and the gods of AEL as the goat of the Lord he went to the cross and they killed him yes sir he has to continue the the work as the other goat is the goat of AEL that we take all the sins and we take it away very far when Jesus was killed it was his soul that continued Hallelujah in other words it was his soul that played the role of the god of AEL Amen to take those things away thank you Jesus now I understand that the true [Music] repentance that take sins away it's not what coming from the lips yes sir but the true repentance it's what coming from the soul when a man repent from his soulet when the soul regrets the sin that regret is very sincere and that what brings sin away amen but if it's something something that they're forcing you you have to repent it's the body it's the int intellectual it's not the body that takes the sins away amen the true repentance comes from the soul amen thank you Jesus Christ now listen Jesus in his soul he the one that went to meet Lucifer in The Fifth Dimension face to face and say I've been looking for you for a long time and Jesus told him he said look at the cross amen he said my blood is still fresh for so long you have Li to people I came to end what you were doing I'm becoming the boss now says he took all the burdens of sins because sin was coming from Lucifer and he thr that to him and that freed the posterity of Abraham am so that I can stand up and say I am without sin amen that's the reason why when he fulfilled that work that's why he went back to Paradise he didn't go to paradise before he took first the sin away and he beat the devil and he freed the saint amen and the road told the New Jerusalem open up and now listen look brother says this is a beautiful thing to have a prophet hallelujah amen Friday he went to the cross say he was covered with Sins not his own sin but our sins amen isn't it and when he was buried he took those sins away he came back without s amen are you there says God wrote that things in the life of Moses because represented God Amen God even told him because you don't want to do what I'm asking you I'm making you God Amen says and Moses has the right hand and his right hand represented the right hand of God and the right hand of God that's Jesus amen what happened on Friday when God told Moses put your hands to your bosom he put He took Jesus he put it into his bosom he took his right he put him in his bosom he said take it away when he took it away was covered by sins and that was that was the lious white as as snow that means the sin was really high Moses was afraid of his own hand Jesus became horrible Hallelujah Jesus was people were afraid of him he was covered by lepers God told it's not done yet take the hand was covered by lepers take the same Jesus Oh cover by sins put him into your bosom what that was the say Easter he say he took it out the hand that was with Leprosy came up pure the sin stay there says the church has something to shout about amen because that day all our the the problem things was up everything that was uh stopping us to go to Glory was done he took out his end he was very clean oh Moses was really rejoicing with his hand God rejoicing about Jesus now the prophet says when he took out his hand for the second time and his hand was [Music] clean why he has to be Shepherd 181 then at Easter yes Easter he took it out he say say amen he took it out into his bosom [Music] and he took it towards you that pure hand and he took it towards you and [Music] me as his word as the form of his word my brother my brother he to uh he took it towards you and me the form of his word to redeem us back to the original Garden from which sin took us from amen when he took his hand out for the second time when Jesus came from Easter he was pure amen and Jesus extended us gave us Jesus in the form of his word why to redeem us to bring us [Music] back to the Gard of Eden where sin took us from we went out of Eden because of sin and what was the sin was the unbelief to the word of God now God is bringing us back his word for us to go back to the Garden of Eden he's giving us Jesus under the form of the word amen amen I don't know how I can expain it and extended it as a as a form of his word 178 the sin went in with transgressing the word of God breaking only one word my brother tonight your soul is over is over hell on a chain amen and that chain in which our soul is over is the the word of God Amen Jesus gave the human race his word to live [Music] by you go over hell over with the word of God don't let anyone don't let anyone bring you something that does say that said the Lord what holding us over hell if the word of God am if my soul this is the traveling on what I was talking about if my Souls hang on to that said the Lord I will go through I will go over amen I will go all the zones of hell I will not fa under amen and tonight if you want your soul to do great things you have to hold the Lord amen a soul that hold that said the Lord we go you be passing over Hell whatever things whatever power of hell is whatever power of Hell will be listen here the King Nebuchadnezzar amen stue he made up a statute and he told all the all these people to go and kneel down towards that statue and to worship it and in his kingdom they had those three Hebrews [Music] they knew that the word of the Lord forbid to kneel down in front of the statute never that's that the Lord I'm telling you tonight don't you let someone sque something else that th said the Lord am and those three men my young men they hold they were holding they were holding to that said the Lord and the King was mad when the King was mad and he really burn the furnace he said burning seven times so that the people that were training those three Hebrews they will even kill themselves they he told them now maybe you don't know [Music] it you will hear it from my own mouth when you will hear the trumpet you have to kneel down toward that statute those three young men HEBs they look at the king oh King live long long long live the king according to kneeling down to your statute we won't do it what was it they were holding that said the [Music] Lord while when you holding to that of the Lord you're going to be passing H whatever power of hell can be if I hold to the word of the Lord heaven and earth will pass away the word of God will never pass away and let me tell you that word of the Lord that those three Hebrew was respecting came from a mouth of a man that came out of the mouth of Moses and Moses was a man that was walking the pill of fire and in this generation we have mares who walk with a
