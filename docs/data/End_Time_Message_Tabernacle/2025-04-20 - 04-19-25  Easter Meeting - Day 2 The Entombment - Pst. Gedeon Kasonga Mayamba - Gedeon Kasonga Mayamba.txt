[Music] just to celebrate the sun rising and then we will have uh breakfast and I believe everyone is uh welcome. Uh that's what brother Bam said. Uh don't hope look for me that quote uh that faith uh we will come we start at 6 to 7 and then we will come back for breakfast uh for the regular service. So we need to follow the prophet. So if you come from 6 to 7 do don't go back home to sleep. Uh we have to go and fellowship during our breakfast. But don't eat too much because when you come back doing regular service, we don't want you to be sleeping. And uh after the regular service then we are going to have lunch. So if you can come hungry so make sure that uh food will be provided. So did you enjoy yesterday's service with father? [Applause] That was the first step of the service. Jesus died on Friday. It was in the afternoon and then the message was so [Music] great that uh it's a special day we should never forget. I don't know if we know this song. Oh, that day. I remember that day. I will never ever forget that day when Jesus washed my sins away. Oh, come on. when Jesus wash my sins away. Brother and sister, that's a special day that you cannot forget and you should always remember. Oh, that day. I remember that day. I will never ever forget that day when Jesus wash my sins away. What a special song. Give me a hand. [Applause] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. So we are going to stand. Did you find that quote? you will we will read it later on. Let us stand and welcome Pastor Gideon. [Music] For he reaches to the highest mountain where handy flow to the lowest fin. Oh, the blood that gives me strength from day to day. He will never lose. He reached for he reached to the high. Oh, and it flow and it flow to the lowest valley. Oh, the blood. Oh, the blood that gives me strength from day to day. He would never. One more time. He wish for he reaches for he reaches to the highest mountain where it flow to the lowest valley. [Music] Oh, I live the blood that gives me strength from day to day. He will never lose his power. May the Lord bless you. We are going directly to take Isaiah chapter 53. We're going to read from verse 4 to verse 5. We are going to read in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. May God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. With this uh text, we are going to talk about the atonement. [Music] Because one Saturday, brother Benham preach about the atunement. The atunement has something special. We saw last Friday was uh the death the death of our Lord Jesus Christ. What was an extraordinary thing? It's by dying he saved us. He didn't look at his precious life, but he sacrificed his own life to redeem us to restore us everything we lost when Adam fall fell. That was wonderful. He bore our sin upon his own body. He bore our sickness upon his body. I want you to pay attention tonight. As long as that body was not buried, God could could see this uh the sins upon this body and could tell who did sin. Oh, God does not bear to see sin. If the body of Jesus was there exposed despite being dead, the anger of God would have been uh strong and uh deprive us from the benefits of his death if he sorry. If he was risen wi without being buried, we I believe we would have been lost. It's not uh no wonder the poet said dying. He saved me and buried he take took my sin away. As long as he wasn't buried, sin was still there upon his body but at the sight of the father. Are we together? He had to be buried to take our sin away. Amen. Amen. to take our sickness away. Verse four, we read. It's our suffering that he took away to bear means here to take away far far away as it was happening in the Old Testament in Leviticus chapter 16. from verse 7 to verse 10 says Leviticus chapter 16 the Bible says you shall take the two goats he's talking about Aaron you will take two goats present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle Aaron shall has lots upon two goats. One lot for the Lord and the other lot for the scapegoat. And Aishan bring the goat upon which the Lord Lot fell and offer him for the sin offering. But the goat on which the Lord fell to be the scapegoat shall be pres presented alive before the Lord to make their atonements and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness. They will bring two goats before the priest. He will slay one uh goat for the atonement. He died for the sin. They had to take the blood, the sin to put on the living goat and to cast him away in the wilderness to take the sin of the people away. Are we together? says in the message living, dying, uh buried, rising and coming back. Uh 59 paragraph 37, he said when something is buried, it's hid. [Applause] It's out of sight. Amen. Amen. buried. He carried my sins far away. God cannot see our sins no more because they are buried. It means before the buried at our sin was not upon us. They were upon Jesus. But God could still see see them. Are we together? God could see them. As long as God could seal them, he could tell this is a Gideon sin. This is Boston sin. He was still on the site, out of sight. The king of God that does not support bear the sins could be strong again and make us lose salvation. That is why the atonement is very important. Amen. Amen. I cannot see our sin no more because they are buried. Where they are buried in the sea of forgetfulness. Think of a sea of forgetfulness. God cannot remember them. The atonement makes God not to remember our sin. Oh, what a blessful day. Death is good. But it took the atonement. Amen. Amen. Yes, my brothers because they are both dead and buried. Brother says, even remembered no more. You will tell God he did this. God cannot even remember anything. He cannot even remember it. Come tell me that I sin. I'll tell you no. I'd never sin. If God doesn't remember them, don't remind me about it. God forgot about it. Amen. Amen. They out of God's memory. Us with our little memory, we can still remember he did this. But for God, he got he got out of his memory. Are we together? That is why what man says about me does I don't care. What matters for me in what God says about me. Amen. Amen. It's out of God's memory. Paragraph 40 says and Jesus was represented in these two goats because there's a false teaching saying Jesus was the goat of the Lord that was slew and the living one was better said Jesus was represented in both the animals, both goats. One, he died. He died for the atonement. The second the sin from the atonement was put upon the scapegoat, the scapegoat. And the scapegoat took the sins of the people and went far into the wilderness to bear the sins of the people. Why does it mean that the gods that was released? The one that was sued. What was it? He was the death. He was the death and the burial of our Lord Jesus. The gods that were slew represented God in his death and the one that was alive. It was God in his. Amen. Amen. He said dying living. He loved me. Dying he saved me. Buried. He carried my sins away. He took the sins of the people. He took the sin of the people upon himself and carried them plum down in the lowest of others. He was the sin offering. He had the sins of the people. He died for them. And also he took our sins upon him. and took our sin far away says so far that God could never see them no more. Think of it. God cannot even see your sin no more. I believe on what the word says. God can never see my sin in this day. because Christ took them away. Say, think of it. The church could scream hallelujah for such a savior. Hallelujah. Can I hear some hallelujah? And I hear glory to God. For what a savior who died for your sins that took them carried them away so far that they cannot even remember it. Oh my brother, what which was buried they cannot even be found on you. Stay with me. If your sin have been buried if lies have been buried, they cannot be found upon you because they have been taken away. Are we do you agree? If they have been buried, they cannot be found on me. Amen. Amen. Yes, my brothers and sisters, even sickness that have been buried, take and dump never been found on you. Are we together? The pain that you feeling, it's a lie. Amen. Amen. I want this tonight by faith. I want you to start feeling your sins going away, your sickness going away, going far away far away, away from you, away from your body, away from your life. Amen. Amen. Yes, my beloved. Somebody can say shout amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Shout hallelujah. Yes, my beloved brothers says paragraph 41, you say our sins are not just forgiven, but they are buried in the sea of forgetfulness to be remembered no more. buried. They carried our sins far away. No more can they be remembered for they are gone. They out of the eyes of the God, you know, in the Old Testament. When they hire a prophet to curse the children of Israel, they were showing you. Look at your people. God said when I look, I don't I don't see any iniquity in Jacob. You look what something else. He doesn't say I don't see iniquities in Israel. That's not what he said. But he said in Jacob or Jacob means a liar. But God looked I don't see any iniquities in Jacob. When God forgives, he carries your sin away. He cannot even remember them. God look at the atonement. Amen. Amen. Yes. My beloved brothers, this is the exact truth. Amen. Amen. They cannot be remembered. They are gone. They are out of the eyes gods. Oh, they are [Applause] paralyzed. Is using all the terms. They are paraly. They are devoid. They are put away. God don't remember them no more. Say what? the church how to rejoice. Amen. Amen. How to rejoice this morning or tonight to know that our gods will no more be no our God sorry that our sin will no more be remembered. They are putting the sin of forgetfulness into the grave beyond any resurrection. They are dead forever. Amen. Amen. Forgotten. Do you want me to read the rest? What says they are if they had never been they never happened. never happened before by leaving Easter. We will be surprised to see things that was buried in your life that would be a disappointment to see sins that were buried to be seen in your life. No, since it's buried in this day, they have to be carried away from your life. God will never remember them no more. Kick him out. Amen. Amen. Yes, my brothers and sisters. This is the exact truth. Dying. He saved me by buried. He carried my sin away. He carried my sins so far till they went into the se of forgiveness. I love this part says, "Oh, we know those things are most truly believed among us." Not just believe. but most surely believed among us. When he was buried, he carried our sins, our sickness away from us. These things are most truly believed among us and they are most surely the truth. They are most surely the truth. You can doubt about anything else but not this one. Your sins, your sickness have been carried away from you. And tonight they had to go away from you because this is the evening of buried. Your sickness have been buried. Your sin have been buried. Your problem buried. Buriness buried. Everything wrong had to be buried. These things are surely surely the most truth. I don't know if you understand the the acting the emphasis that the prophet is putting on this. These things are most truly believed. They are most surely the truth. He's repeating. All these things are God's truth. All those great things we're beyond human expressions, words to express this. We don't have words to express this. God should have given us another language to express what we think about these things. We can never express our gratitude for such things. Amen. Amen. Buried. He carried our sins away. When he went to the cross of Calvary, he had our sin upon him, my sickness upon him. When he died, he paid the price. My sins was still upon him. God could see them. God said then you need the atonement. Amen. Amen. He had to be in tuned for your the sin to be gone away from you. For that sickness to be gone away from you. That is why tonight it's very important for everybody that is sick or they have a certain need. Amen. Amen. to have a right mental attitude to have a renewal of mind to be in harmony with the mind of God. Don't be out of the face of the mind of God. Be in harmony with the mind of God. Amen. Amen. When God said they had been carried away, be in the same harmony with that mind. Don't be God say one thing and then you think something else. No my brother notice the healing or it comes after the forgiveness of sins. Are we together? We read in verse four. He was wounded for our sins, bruised for our iniquities. Then by his stripes we are healed. Are we together? Healing always comes after the forgiveness of sins. God first drill with the sins and when it's settled the consequences of sins have been settled. Amen. That is why even when they brought the the before Jesus before healing the man he told him first take courage my son your sins had been forgiven it's after then he said take your bed and go are we together he had first to settle this problem of sin when that problem has been settled healing comes after. Amen. Amen. Amen. That is why in Psalm chapter 103 verse two verse three, David said this, my soul, bless the Lord and forget not his all his benefit. Listen, who forgiveth all thy iniquities? I want to convince somebody that God does not forgive certain iniquities, not few certain iniquities. No matter your iniquities, my Bible says, he forgiveth all thy iniquities. means all your iniquities. Amen. Amen. And when he forgives all your iniquities, he health all that diseases. There's no diseases. That is stronger than the atonement. I don't know in what language should I speak. There's not disease or sin stronger than the blood of Jesus Christ. It does not exist, my brother. No matter your disease, no matter what it is, the Bible says God forgiveth all that iniquity. I want your mind be in harmony with the mind of God. Amen. When God says all your iniquities, don't say but this one, even this one, what do you mean even this one? What do you mean? When he says health all their disease, don't say he heals. That's true. But this one, no. Listen. Let's all read together out loud. All out loud. You you can read it in English. Verse four. Who Who forgiveth all thy iniquities? Who healeth all thy diseases? Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. He forgives all thy iniquities and he heals all their diseases. in the message guarding his people uh 27 February 1950 uh second part five says and then go and see no more he was speaking to the women that committed he said go and see no more a worse thing come upon thee So therefore in order to obtain your healing you'll have to become Christian after you are healed to heal you God can even heal the s even the pagan you don't need to be a Christian to be healed but to keep your healing you have to become Christian are we together therefore To keep your healing, you will have to become Christian after you heal. And I believe I will say this. Talking of the dual atonies. When you are healed, your sins are forgiven you. They both go together. When God forgives you, he heals you. If he heals you, that means he forgiven you. Amen. Amen. I didn't hear very amens on that. Amen. Amen. But this is the exact truth. Amen. They all go together. He heals and he forgives. If you are healed, that means God has forgiven you. Become Christian if you were not Christian. Amen. Amen. upon the word Lord. March uh 48 second part paragraph 5 says now he's here to heal tonight. Why will he heal some and leave others go? Why? As if God was lacking power, as if he was limited in power, why would he heal some let others go without being healed? He say, see, it's not God's will for any of you to go unhealed. Let your mind be in harmony with the mind of God. It's not the will of God to let none of you to go unhealed. It's not God's will for any of you to go, to go unsaved. The will of God is to heal you all and to save you all. Amen. Amen. And when God works, imagine a God in whom we believe, the great Jehovah, the almighty God, the seven compound name. Imagine that God, he wants to heal you. What is that power that will hinder God from doing it? What is that demon that will stand in the way of God's healing? when it's his will. What is that power that will hinder God to save you? When it's the will of God to save you, when you realize, it is the will of God. Oh my brother, rejoice because there's no kingdom that can stand in the way of God that can hinder him to fulfill his will. Amen. Amen. When God wants to bless you, who can hinder him? Nobody. I say nobody. I want you to understand that very well. It's the will of God. That is why I don't pray. Oh God, if it's your will, bless me. It's already his will. There's no if. I don't put [Music] if. Oh God, if if you want, heal me. He already said his his will. When you come back before him if it's your will, it means you are doubting his will and you will not be healed and you will not receive that thing. Go before God. Tell him you say you want to hear me. Amen. Amen. Amen. Go. Don't go using C. If somebody went in the Bible, he had a leprosy, he told the Lord, Lord, if if you want cleanse me. Why did Jesus I I want it. Be cleansed. Yes, he wanted it. We came for that. Don't you doubt the will of God. As long as your need is the right knees, it's the will of [Applause] God. If you're asking millions to serve the Lord, It is will. Don't say if you will what you will want. No. That's not how I pray. Once I know his will, I go before God with courage. I'm speaking to him in I'm claiming my rights and he gives me because that's his will. Another one when the Bible he was doubting the power of Jesus Christ and this child has had epilepsy. He said if you want if you can if you can heal my son Jesus said if I can you said if I can you don't even know who you're talking to. if I can. Jesus was worried. He said, "You really asking me if I have power? You really telling me if I have power to heal your son? You don't even know who you're talking to. Don't go before God using if you can, if you could. Go before God with his word." Amen. Amen. When you have his word, go before him with his word. Just take that if away from your mouth. It is the will of God to heal you. It is the will of God to save you. And when God saves, he saves completely. saved fully, perfectly. Amen. Amen. Yes, my brothers and sisters, I believe in a God that saves me that even saves my job, my whole house, my enterprise, everything that I do, Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes, my brothers and sisters, this is the exact truth. Amen. Amen. It's the will of God to give you that. Amen. Amen. It's the will of God to bless thee. It's the will of God tonight to heal you. That is why. He forgiveth all your iniquities and he health all your diseases. Then if you know his will, I can have a will and I can be limited. Are we together? The pastor can have a will but it's very limited. But the one who has a will here, he has all the resources before making promises. I said it the other day. It takes his time to have calculations. I have all the resources and when I'm sure I have the resources then he can pronounce the word once he said it says God is bound by his word sometime we don't understand it very well amen when you remind God his word you are bound in God becomes weak the only way to get away from it is will fulfill the promise. Praise God. If you want to seek God's weakness, take his word, stop bonding him. Stop binding him. He becomes weak without power until he fulfills his word to freed himself. And God doesn't like to be bound. As soon as you burn him, as soon as he release himself by fulfilling his word. [Music] Amen. Praise God. God is bound by his word until he fulfills it. Yes, my brothers and sisters, when you know, who has the will to bless you who wants to heal you, who wants to save you, you know his power, you can be comfortable. Amen. Amen. In torment of the Lord Jesus, it's the perfect expression of his will and of his power. to give you all that you need. But the Bible says, Revelation chapter 5, second part 61, 18th June 61, paragraph 15. He says, sister on the in the on the wheelchair or maybe others that are sick and afflicted. Now listen, I want us all to read together. Let's all read together. That's how I preach. Let's go. If you can have perfect understanding that it's God's good pleasure to make you well, there isn't enough devils in the country to keep you sick. Do you understand [Applause] this? How you going to stay sick? If you can understand and the perfect understanding, it pleases God. So please God, good pleasure to make you well. Bam says, there's not enough devil in the country to keep you sick. There's not enough demon in the country to keep you sick. In another place he says there's no enough demon in hell. One hell is not enough. It takes maybe 50 hells. Unfortunately, there's only one hell. Hell is not enough to keep you from being healed. Praise God. I want us to understand tonight by burial. It's in good pleasure. It pleases God so well. God is not happy to see you sick, to see you mourning, complaining, to see you childless while you want it. It's not God's good pleasure.
