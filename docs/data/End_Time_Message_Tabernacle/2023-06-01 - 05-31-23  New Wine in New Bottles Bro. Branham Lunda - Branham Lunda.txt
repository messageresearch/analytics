easy here to see them coming oh God reward them for the sacrifice we place them in the name of foreign meet the desire of your people amen amen thank you All In The Name Of The Lord Jesus amen amen it's always a privilege to be alive and be to be in there amen amen we have few visitors here we have brother Mitchell probably [Applause] thank you very much Rachel thank you very much we welcome you in the church I feel comfortable your family did you this is the Church of God and we believe God will speak to men amen uh the exhortation of tonight plasma is truly I don't know how to entitle it but these two scripture was in my heart [Music] depression since Brother Richard was preaching the pastora president and the past to preach is and especially the scripture of Matthew he kept bubbling in my heart so I thought it caught my thoughts I try to speak what does he mean what brother Branham said about it and when the pastor asked me to preach something else but that kept on inspiring me bubbling in my heart while I was meditating I was seeing scriptures men are realities in reality I didn't know how to entangle the preaching of tonight we're just going to commit ourselves to God yeah may God knows our needs our souls amen Jesus Took the word foreign with them they were always seeking a mistake to find a way to accuse Jesus see Jesus was the word of that time the way he was preaching is that word was making them uncomfortable every time when the true words always brings people it always where the true word is coming from and the phrases Jesus look at the Baptist [Music] if you can read it again that would be good verse 14. the distribution then came to him the disciple of John saying why do we end the first is the first of all but that is type of first not can the children of the bread chamber Moon as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bread room will be taken and then shall they fast second question that's how with this question now Jesus is keep on keep on answering them yes [Music] which is in the garden and the rent is Divine nouveau neither do men put new wine the barrels will break [Music] they put new wine into new barrels both are preserved but for the elect yes Jesus was able to explain to them what he meant sometimes this Bible is [Music] written amen now we know in the Bible they're all in the wine goes along pay attention to for just few minutes with the message of faith without faith you cannot receive anything from God [Music] as in Ephesians foreign [Music] getting into perfection because God cannot fail Jesus [Music] by saying that foreign uh they're just like a vessel in the old times you know today we have this type of bottles the science says water and all the liquid you can put it even in the little bottles but at all times they look like because if you understand how they look like foreign [Music] blow up [Music] [Music] you [Music] see somebody walking funny [Music] because it took a little bit of wine it's different from a normal person you notice the effects of wine it becomes the crisis foreign [Music] [Music] you don't control yourself [Music] [Music] there has to be something happening in the house [Music] the Holy Ghost is living let us go see when people came it is [Music] why are they like drunk [Music] they are not drunk as you think man but it is [Music] [Music] [Music] think real things we became so mechanical [Music] Peter preach 50 50 seconds we crucify ourselves what shall we do yeah [Music] each one of you for the forgiveness [Music] wine Carlos sentence [Music] [Music] and Jesus by saying that he wanted to say yes it's when the the skin is fresh their skin has oil made that that skin has oil and guns and when the oil when you pull out the new wine fella not the old wine because the new wine salazi has life within foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] you cannot lose foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] the you need something that is there you pour into it then will blow up and you lose the wine and the bottle explication that's why Jesus wanted to explain it let's see the the spiritual application of it is conservation why some people cannot conserve the life when I was reading it I said to myself why Jesus spoke in its way Prophet but I thank God for the prophet there's nothing in the Bible or Prophet that God did not reveal to the prophet I love it because we're preaching from an open book it's a lot about practice that uh Western people cannot keep the victory 30 foreign foreign [Music] it is [Music] we only have glass bar queles it doesn't make any difference but when I visit the Eastern countries what Jesus was talking about how I don't look like in fact nowadays we only have a glass of bottles but when I visit the Eastern Street I found out that the water bottles of that day was made of of animal skin and then fresh and when the animal skin was fresh and the new skin cells and when it got older said and to take new non-fermented and fermented yet we had the dream of life in it when it begins to fermented produce there was an explosion wonders [Music] [Music] [Music] are you there foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] will stretch and the best it can stretch app and when you begin to preach the party the love of God healing signs and wonders when the Bible says amen amen [Music] it's conceived not to receive the full word of God basket because you bear with the fermentation of the world but the one who has the new skin when they preacher or when they put the words [Music] foreign [Music] flexible skin my exhortation of tonight that question reservoir for us for us oh Jessica Jesus Christ is the same yesterday the new skin will say Amen they will stretch out here [Music] or the Dr Jones says don't teach it forever you see paragraphs yes [Music] now foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] has already given us the preachers [Music] [Music] [Music] with a lot of reasoning that blessing won't be real for you and people will start saying we were there foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] for that's the devil the one who has the the skin with oil they wondered when the enemies you remember the the quote that the pastor Alberti I was crazy that day what he said say complicated our faith can uh struggle set questions but their power amen raise Jesus from the dead will never leave a True Believer press the Finish is just to end up when I get there the second I know as an evil I know this in this level it's just a problem then Papa affected it's just a matter of a child with respect the child can be whatever he can man but elected and Jesus as wicked is your parents on the earth they can give you good things [Music] no parents on the earth can do it yes [Music] the best [Music] I have a good future for you that's for you amen yeah God wants to help us please we want to help ourselves God wants to help us please [Music] amen amen amen he's a wonderful God that we have quite a few things like this [Music] [Music] Son of God [Music] increase the ancestors [Music] [Music] [Music] every time [Music] in this message they don't feel time is flying it's just a massage okay on violent

Venom is telling us let's go to paragraph 21. This is I always wonder why this declaration of uh was made statement was made why you can't just put new wine in the old bottles I came to find out explain this is still the one of the pudding in the
