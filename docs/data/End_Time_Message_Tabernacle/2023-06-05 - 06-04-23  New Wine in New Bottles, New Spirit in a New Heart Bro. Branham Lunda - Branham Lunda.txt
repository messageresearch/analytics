impersonation of Christianity for January 20th uh I believe paragraph 41. nor is the order of the scripture [Music] [Music] then he said this doesn't mean it's the Holy Ghost can we project this limitations impersonation of Christianity said January 20th 57. morning sometime we have a different paragraph s you know many people you know foreign [Music] [Music] 108. then he said yes I'll give you a new spirit now illness there is where we the mistake has been made a lot of people behind exam many people Plato vienne rather come to the altar to prayer and they get down there praying and
