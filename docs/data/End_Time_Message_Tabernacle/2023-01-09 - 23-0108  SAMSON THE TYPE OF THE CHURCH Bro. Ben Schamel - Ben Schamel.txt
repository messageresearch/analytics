you foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] man so we have a Thanksgiving uh from our sister Solange Mercier myself and my husband and uh the whole family we are very grateful and touched by the sympathy and compassion that you have shown a poof uh during this long time of uh morning the day we say sincerely thank you to the entire church and to the pastor for your presence and support during this difficult and painful time you have proven to us that we are really a family in Christ may God reward you for your kindness and generosity and give back to you more than what you have given it is [Applause] we have given you the plan for those who will be traveling to Israel this uh summer God willing yeah yeah that will be during the month of June God willing um and it was said that the first deposit of 500 for those traveling is must be paid during the month of January and I believe everyone has received an email where to send the 500 um yeah please confirmed by paying your portion of the trip I said to hold your spot and the balance will be paid later on as brother George Will indicators and also those who don't have American passport America we will need a visa visa you need to start looking for the Visa Visa those who have Congolese a passport uh Mexican passport feel like you're on the passport Mexican knowing that in order to travel to Europe and uh foreign [Music] [Music] you may obtain One Visa maybe for Europe and not have the visa for Israel opportunities amen amen so I believe everyone who has signed up for trip make sure that uh you comply is amen amen and uh last uh announcement I have is just a reminder for the order in the church we have continuously to remind the people those along countries I believe when you come for service you have to prepare yourself in order for God to speak to you and if God doesn't speak to you that means you did not make the services the first thing is the ins and out during the service I don't know how you make the service really I understand if you have a little ones they need to go bathroom or happen in and out functions but just anticipate that when you are out something can be said that could have helped you amen foreign give them put them on diapers if they need to eat zombies that's something a little bit different when the baby cries on paper control how many know brother Branham said this is during a normal service sometimes babies are not doing much but when it comes time for prayer to cast out demon foreign but regardless of the length of the service there are people who never go in and out yeah I always give you my testimony when I travel last time I went to Congo uh I knew the service take about eight hours before going to church people said you have to eat a lot and the drink I said I will not eat I will not drink I was sitting during the service for eight hours until I went out never go back to the restrooms I don't want to miss anything and also I don't want my presence in the church to be a distraction for anybody when they see that Pastor is they will say you see things that you hit in America now see the result brother you have to be a blessing and control the atmosphere atmosphere and sometimes even in the little room back there yeah you think the mummies are feeding the babies they are sleeping they don't mean what is the purpose and after service you ask them what was said yes this is the beginning of the year we have to change some habits we need to get closer to God we have to show our commitment uh our reference amen amen another point no this place is for worship unless you have a special conditions maybe a pregnant woman who cannot control certain things you may have your maybe your water bottle and uh if that's really necessary or somebody may be being disturbed by cough but here we are not here to drink water you cannot exists we are sending a wrong message maybe to the visitors or somebody else visitors there is a message on Church order you can go read and uh really remind you on certain things amen amen may God bless you this is the job we have to do yes from time to time we have to do a reminder and when we remind we trust that somebody is gonna pay a little bit attention foreign [Music] [Music] please is [Music] a sweet dance [Music] [Applause] [Music] was lost [Music] but now I [Music] am [Applause] [Applause] remember [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Applause] our praise [Music] [Music] please please God [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] please God please [Music] [Music] [Music] we know Let's Dance [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we've been there Ten Thousand Years [Music] [Applause] [Applause] one way amen we just appreciate the atmosphere here this morning we just want to say thank you to our pastor fossen for another opportunity to speak to you foreign [Music] we're not here to try to preach our ideas but we're here to reinforce the message we're here to preach but the message has already preached amen judges 16 starting with verse 25. the Bible says and it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they said call for Samson that he may make us Sport and they called for Samson out of the prison house and he made them Sport and they set him between the pillars and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that I may lean upon them now the house was full of men and women and the Lords of the Philistines were there and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women that beheld Samson while he made Sport and Samson called unto the Lord and said O Lord God remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once o God that I may at once be Avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes foreign foreign Lord we just ask that you would just come down and have preeminence in this service Lord we've already sang the songs of Zions Lord we've gotten all of the announcements out of the way Lord we're coming to the portion of the service where your word is the department Lord we just ask that you would prepare our hearts prepare our minds Lord we just ask that you would help us to be ready to receive your word Lord you said in the scriptures that some seeds fall on on rocks and hard places the some seeds fall by the wayside the Lord help us to be that fertile Lord we want our hearts to be a place where your word can abides Lord we want to be a church that's lining up with the scriptures Lord that's our desire here this morning or as the preaching Goes Forth if there be any here that are sick Lord if there's anybody here that's bound with chains Lord we just ask that you would freeze we may be able to put the things in the past in the past and move forward Lord we know we have another opportunity with this new year opportunity Lord we expected you're coming last year but Lord we know if you didn't come last year then maybe you'll come this year Lord we want to be ready for your comments well that's why we're gathered here today is we want to see your word in power and demonstration we just asked that you would be with each and every one amen amen amen you may be seated amen and we just want to say thank you to the church for the other opportunity you know I had uh recently gone over to Africa on a mission's tripura [Music] for me as an American being born here in America where we're so privileged we've got everything that we want we've got all the food that we want we've got the nice houses we've got the cars we have everything we want the entertainment and when you travel over there to do evangelism when you go to do Mission work and you see that the situation is different for them and how they still gather themselves together in church it gives you a different perspective I'm sure many of you have traveled over there or are from there and you know exactly what I'm talking about people may not have shoes on their feet but they'll walk four hours to go to church and all I can do I'm supposed to be there ministering to them and all I can say is God help me be more like them Lord help me have a burning desire in my heart where I would walk four hours barefooted just to make it to church just to make it to church on Wednesday they would walk the church on Friday night they would walk to church again on Sundays and I thought to myself do they have jobs because over in America we have jobs we have a hard time making it on just Wednesday and I thought what is the difference it changed me I have traveled many places but sometimes you just need a reminder what your burning desire is about what the result can be when you have the Holy ghosts right and that's why we gather ourselves together because Paul told the Ephesians he says as the day draws near gather yourselves together don't sit at home and just listening to tapes is good but you need to get yourselves together why because there is an atmosphere [Applause] if you get a lake of fire from over here and you get a look at flyer from over there [Music] it can do something for your children it can do something for those around you so I was just very encouraged by going over to Africa I learned a lot about just preaching yeah how to get yourself out of the way that was important for me because it's not just important when you're behind the pulpit and preaching performance you apply those same principles to your everyday life and that was the important part for me because many times when I'm preaching I try to have everything planned out I try to to make sure that I know how the surface is going to go but sometimes that's not what God wants sometimes God wants to go another Direction it's many times in our lives we try to plan everything out we want to get married by this saying we want to have so many kids we want to make so much money and we let all those other distractions keep us from moving in the channel of the Holy Spirit you see it's not only the speaker that has to get himself out of the way but us as a congregation ourselves that we might be able to step into the channel of the holy spirit that we might be able to receive something from God so when you travel to Africa you see signs and wonders many times you see all these great things happening but when we come over to America we're not seeing those things anymore Alpha School so that's why I wanted to take this scripture if I were to take a title it would be Samson a type of the church does so well of setting the scene of Samson once a great man he was a judge of Israel and one day he he finds himself he's in this great Temple of Dagon it's a fish God and he finds himself blinded and he's in a temple that was shaped brother Branham said like a mushroom it was such a great Temple the scripture says there were 3 000 men and women on the roof brother Brandon also said there were people on the it was like the World Cup for them they had club seats to the World Cup and especially VIP because an enemy that had tormented them for so long they thought that they had victory over himself they said let's bring Samson out and make sure let's have him do a little couple tricks for us let's have him entertain us and brother Brandon types that right to the church he says back on the day of Pentecost the church had great power and then a church age comes and the devil starts like Delilah getting that church to lay down in their laps tries to warm up to them and say that you're you're we're friends now if you love me you'll tell me your secrets you see the devil's been trying to find what our secret is for thousands of years and in the Ephesians he cut off the secret he bound the church up Brothers but then the Holy Ghost moves on I don't understand another church age arises and it breaks the binds of the devil yeah and what does the devil do he uses the same tactic again Wesley oh yeah Wesley Avenue and they denominate and he binds them back up Samsung can't do anything down but he needed the Holy Ghost to come back so he could break those chords again and Delilah comes back a third time [Music] she says you don't really love me if you loved me then you would tell me yourself and he starts getting closer to the to the promise says well if you just weave my Seven Locks I don't see too much he started tapping into the Revelation the just shall live by faith the Pentecostal age and what did they do found them right back and brother Branham says we must be careful church because Pentecost is going right back where it came from separate ourselves from that denominational system and what I saw with the contrast of going to Africa is that so many people here in America we're letting the claws of of Lady osia infiltrate Our Lives that's right so many times we treat our relationship with God like a New Year's resolution right yeah today's the eighth right how many of you set New Year's resolutions I want to make more money I'm gonna do this different than last year and today is probably half of us have already foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] a burning desire yeah the scripture says in revelation 2. God says but I have something against you because you have lost your first love that was back in the first church age within 300 years of Jesus coming the church had already lost its first love but let me bring it down to ours listen listen remember back when you got first Saved remember the joy that was in your life but to tell somebody else about it you remember how you couldn't put this Bible down remember when you were reading the promises of God you're saying that promises you're excited you had a burning desire [Music] but now we've cooled off the message had come out of Pentecost and I'm afraid what we're seeing today is that the message churches images the devil knows his tactics work so he's not going to change it but just because we call ourselves it does not mean that we're not subject to those Temptations so we start to nominating around the message I start saying if you don't believe it exactly like I do then you're going to hell if you don't listen to enough tapes then you're not safe if you're not a part of our club then then you can't come to us and brother Branham preached against this so hard but here we are sitting in message churches all across the world and we're going right back to the Catholic spirit so my warning to you is be careful I had to do some Reflections on my life over the last years you see when I've tried to preach something I was telling my dad this last night on the phone I said sometimes it's hard to find inspiration for a service sometimes it's a lot of work we need to pray for our preachers to pray for our pastors we need to pray for our deacons we need to pray for our parents because sometimes being a Christian is a lot of work basketball we're not always at the top of the mountain but I told them sometimes to find inspiration I just have to look at my life and I have to preach myself because I know I can find inspiration if I'm preaching to myself I don't know what your problems are but I know what my problems so if I can preach on my problems if I can find victory in my promise if God can do that for me that for sure so I'm not trying to offend anybody here this morning I'm just preaching it myself but don't get caught in that denominational Spirit [Applause] um that same Catholic spirit is trying to creep into the message our pastor's just been going through all of the the Seven Seals in the church ages exposes what the trail of the serpent is that complacent Catholic Spirit Catholic it's the spirit that wants to mix the good and the bad boy and if we can't see that Spirit now if we can't look at the world today and know what's going on then like Samson you are completely blind the church world has completely but I just thank God that we have a message to be able to expose God didn't leave us without weapons God didn't leave us without armor but he equipped us with a message amen praise the Lord so we see Samson and there's a way on Samsung and he finds himself in this predicament and brother Branham says and just once more Lord you'd like to pull it up it's uh 1963 1201. paragraph 43. and brother random says and that's the picture of the church he says I can read in the Bible of the church when it was first filled with the Holy ghosts free he says great signs and wonders accompanied their meanings we can remember just a few years ago 40 50 years ago when the church was filled with that same power conversation so listen to what he says he says but look at it today she stands stripped something has stripped her shoes the same thing that stripped Sampson all cause by listening to a woman that took him um well strip the church is listening to that organized woman situation that old Jezebel silver so the same thing that strip Sampson back there it's the same strategy that the devil is trying to get you to come to church on Sundays and have you sit in your chair right there and have you completely unaffected by what the word is saying think about maybe I should say that again if the devil wants you coming to church on Sunday sitting in that seat and be completely unaffected by the words I had to do a hard look at myself when I come to church when I prepared because or do I have all these other things on my mind am I thinking of work when I'm at church down in the South they call it fixing your tractor at church [Music] because in the South you're driving your tractor it breaks down [Music] you still go to church but the entire time you're trying to fix the tractor in your mind you're not hearing what the preacher's saying you're trying to call John Deere the next day John Deere you're trying to install the part you're trying to plan out how it's going to go completely miss a blessing from God did you that is greater than fixing your jack yep you're gone the very thing that Samson had been raised up to defeat brother Branham says I'm sure sorry this is remember the very thing that Samson was raised up to defeat La memories now remember this is that same Samson that was in Gaza Gaza and the Philistines tried to trap him Anthony and he woke up at midnight and he goes over to the gates and he plucks those Gates off the hinges it pulls out the posts and all the bikes weighing tons each yeah now what's amazing about it Samson was not a big man sometimes a little Samson can be five years old sometimes we need Samson's letter seven years old sometimes we need Samson's that are 17 years old sometimes we need samsons that are not big men but foreign he doesn't need our our human strength he is the strength we look at Samson we we think of him as a symbol of strength but brother Brandon told us that he was just a shrimp of a man he probably looked a little shorter than me you could throw me around like a rag doll [Music] but imagine me going and picking up those Gates over to the hill by by Hebron I don't know what this is in kilometers but he carried them 37 miles 37.6 miles sometimes we get winded walking from our house to the car but when that Holy Ghost comes impossible things are possible because that's the kind of God I don't care if you've got cancer impossible things are possible it doesn't matter what circumstances With God all things are possible we had a prophet to bring us back to Hebrews 13 8. that God is the same yesterday today and foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if the devil of anxiety anxiety he begins to get scared [Music] just like those Philistines did come see Philistines when Samson came to them boundary [Music] and they go to take him and he breaks the ropes and he picks up a Jawbone and he starts striking one by one a thousand Philistines [Music] many times we think oh we're not equipped to be a good vessel for God I can't speak I've got dyslexia whatever it is I tell you one thing that when those Philistines heard the name Samson probably know something she got scary when those Philistine commanders saw Samson just whacking their guys down brother random said they started to scatter like roaches when the lights turned on foreign [Applause] out of here amen we don't just have to sit there as a defeated bride of Jesus Christ God's not coming back for a defeated bride he's coming back for a Victorious one that will take God at his promise said that God is honor bound to fulfill his problems my Bible says that he is faithful and true amen so where's the doubted I don't know what your situation is it doesn't matter what your situation is this morning we don't have to wait for later we don't have to wait 10 days like in the upper room so today you can receive your problems that's why brother Brandon would sing you'll only believe all you have to do is take God at his word and believe but we don't like it it's too simple we need to work ourselves up into something no it's God hiding himself in simplicity but the very thing that Samson had been raised up to my feet had defeated him lovely thank you and the Pentecostal church tonight maybe we say the the message church tonight the very thing she was raised up to defeat denominationalism she has grouped herself back into it again and her power is gone right exactly the power of the Lord has left I tell you that's not where we want to find ourselves but we need to reevaluate our lives we just need to grow closer to God hallelujah hallelujah brother Branham says later on foreign and I didn't copy the the verse I'm sorry it says you they're going to force you into it that's why I've been against this organizational system organization that's it I had to keep quiet about it but it's late enough now so you can know it's the truth see it's that exactly he exposes it right there he likes fuzzy 1963. I mean I had to keep quiet about it being the mark of the beast but it's late enough now tell you can know it's the truth sometimes we get too uh caught up in organized organizing our church organizations we get too caught up in in teaching doctrines that we forget the holy ghosts or sometimes we get so uh obsessed with preaching our agenda uh that we completely forget the Holy Spirit and brother Brandon was preaching in California one time he said if this is a small group in California could fully surrender to the holy ghosts it would turn California upside down by tomorrow [Applause] that's the kind of power that we have when you think of California did you think of holiness foreign [Applause] [Applause] how much more could it do for Brighton come on how much more could it do Forever Green if we could fully surrender ourselves we would quit trying to do things on our own forget all righteousness and all we do is rely on Jesus Christ amen [Applause] we have a promise today that there is going to be a bride Hallelujah the moon that's shown on the wall when brother Brandon was preaching the seven uh Church ages there originally was no light in the seventh age but God allowed a little light somebody's gonna be that light somebody is going to be an overcome and why would we leave that opportunity for somebody else but today we can stand up and we can say I am not light all right [Applause] we're going back to the word if the scripture says it I believe it if the scripture says amen if if the message says speak to this sickness and it'll go then I believe it if the Bible says there's going to be a prize then I'm going to be that brother doesn't matter if there's one out of college I'll have to skip some of this brother random says this where should I Strength gone Samson 1959 foreign but the church is not an educational program it's for the power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost demonstration we know we come to the house of the Lord for correction we know we come to the house of the Lord to learn Doctrine um but don't get so focused on that yes that you forget the Holy Ghost because that's where the power and demonstration is that's the whole reason that we're here brother Branham said I would rather have you wrong in your Doctrine foreign because it's the spirit they give it the life we can read the dead letter all we want to come out but if we don't have the spirit then we won't have the life that's why you can only go so far on your own um instead of life out of the spirit that would be like trying to take a baby's birth certificate and saying see this is the baby's life I have documentation that the baby's alive it was born on this date at this time it was this many pounds in this long kilogram you could see who the mother is and the father is a man but that is no proof of life but it's the spirit that giveth life so when that baby is born and the doctor gives it a good old-fashioned gospel speaking [Applause] spiritual and you hear that baby please let me uh decide where we're gonna go I'm gonna try to wrap it up before too long all right okay just once more Lord 63 no I'm coming foreign now the thing of it is the people are not willing to pay the price to get back those are powerful words because brother Brown has just exposed the Catholic Spirit foreign [Music] and he says now the thing of it is that people are not willing to pay the price I believe that God just Remains the Same as he ever was but the thing of it is the people has got so wound up in the world and the world in them till they got just enough religion to make them miserable results now many times we try to put this Catholic Spirit foreign or we try to say that the the worldly things he says you're caught up in the world we think of all those Sinners out there in the world carousing we see uh we think of all those people in the clubs or or drinking um where brother Branham says here till they got just enough religion to make them miserable that means they're sitting here in church not enough to really turn loose to God and not give your whole heart unto him but enough I see listen to what he says yeah I go to church I enjoy good singing and clapping hands yeah I love that but when it comes right down to putting what you say you believe makes a practice and willing to confess the wrong yes they don't do it just isn't there they don't have it well that's real conviction that's what we need we've long left that a long time ago prayer confession conviction a conviction we've swapped it for emotions that's the reason there's no holding tights because there's nothing to hold them young people if you want to be held you need to get a hold of the one that's going to hold you growing up in the message church is not going to hold you I grew up in a youth group and very very few are still in the church why because there was nothing that held them but something that came out of the same youth group the membership we were taught the same thing and there's people with different results what's the difference you have to have an anchor you have to have an absolute this message and this scripture is our absolutely and don't get that Catholic Spirit of trying to divide it foreign [Applause] but if you sit in here like a young person and you get just enough religion but you're not willing to give God everything then you are going to be miserable that goes for anyone but especially the young people if your heart is with Delilah and you're going to try to be a judge of Israel you are going to be a miserable Samson miserable that Catholic Spirit breaking into the message we see so many preachers I was at a Minister's meeting one time that had to do with interracial marriage which is a very very sticky subject [Music] and there was a message preacher hello that thought he knew more than brother Branham and he says the interracial marriage does not matter God only created love God in his Divine wisdom created a bond called love and nothing can separate that God is love so if God is in it then don't let man rip it apart that sounds pretty good right yes well what if I decide I'm gonna go out there and love a harlot you see over here the Catholic Spirit Catholic started out as a white horse goes to a red horse and a black horse and a pail we're living in the age where they're trying to mix everything up your pastor is the only one that I've ever heard that has preached on interracial marriage and tied it back to the Catholic church because that's exactly what I was telling this brother is God likes variety he doesn't want everybody to get all mixed up he doesn't want to throw bread horse mixing with a donkeys because once that mule is born and you can never breed it back amen but they're trying to mix all these worldly ideas I tried to mesh them with the message so now what do you find well that's got to be just brother Brandon's opinion so then what is brother Brandon's opinion and what's God's opinion foreign [Music] my message says that we get there 30 45 minutes before church he's the message says we should be I can't wait to get to church do we believe the message or do we not believe the message remember I'm just preaching it myself quit worrying about what the person on the other Pew is gonna think the scriptures lay out exactly what we have to do if you find yourself in the wrongs don't sit there ashamed and do nothing amen amen amen why is it so hard because it's too difficult I understand do you have a pride you hear what other people think about us please but you see the Catholic spirit is coming to the message where people like to did you hear them and that devil likes to get in and church not because it hinders but it hinders the person in the back where God is dealing with them and they don't want to come to the Friends and instead of going with our Christian brother in prayer together fighting together again Satan gets our our guns trained on each other where people are going around saying oh did you hear this person's doing this inside we should be working together as a team We Are One finger can't look at the the toes and say oh you're no goodness the fingers ain't going nowhere so we find Samson there hello try to bring this too close 10 or 15 minutes so now we find Samson here he's been made fun of yeah and there's a little boy leading him around he says lead me to those posts because Samson had a revelation that God had once moved in his life Seven Locks that he wants me and he had an idea hello [Music] he said come and fill me one more time give me a burning disciples [Music] give me another chance many people like to say that Samson had a breakthrough right there a breakthrough is a great thing just imagine those big great Gaza walls and if you're gonna break through then you would need a very big battery many times that's like our prayers Lord help us one more time [Music] and then the devil hears it in hell oh was that our gates just shaking another prayer comes I think I heard a crack in the door just once more Lord and one of these days you hit it enough times [Applause] but Samson didn't only have a breakthrough you see when that strength became to come it became to come back on Samson and he felt the strength in his body and he began to push on those pillars I like to say he not only had a breakthrough but he had a destroyed through he like you in a demolition because we're not looking just to break through their Gates it doesn't matter if there's three thousand Devils we're not looking to break through into the temples we've got a God that's big enough we can push on those pillars [Applause] all we have to do is submit our hands and we say Lord use me just once more then we'll have it destroyed will demolish everything First John 3 and 8. it says for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil I think he did please reserve for the devil not break the work of the devil if something is broken it can be fixed if something is destroyed it cannot be fixed amen amen for this purpose was the son of God manifested that he might destroy the works that means this year no more gossiping brother Foster the critique [Applause] no more amen no more showing up with a bad attitude [Music] no more grumbling about the person across the way please but let's spend this year building our team if you want to win in the World Cup you can't just have Messi you don't have to have a championship team to keep the champion what's happening we need each and every one of you sometimes we might need your prayers sometimes we might need your prayers that's why we need prayer meetings so what are we really focusing on what are we really focused on we're worried about Ronaldo over on another team and what he's going to do oh who's the best you know who's the best uh minister in the message who's got the biggest church [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] happened in the book of Acts and in our church today one more uh one more quote Daniel perfect Faith 1963. that's zero eight two five e beginning of the message paragraph 10. he says remember I'm not immune to Temptations He says I've got to overcome that because don't think you're going to be Samson there pushing down those pillars with no struggle right being a Christian is not for the faint of heart you might feel like you're on a mountain today but don't worry and the same victory that you have today take it to Monday but we're not immune to Temptations brother Brandon said I've got to overcome them when I look back and I see something like this is a convention where the church is working together where the church begins to have Unity within itself they begin to pray with one another they begin to respond to the words they begin to support the the other ministers he says when I look back and see something listen to what he does with it he says I put it right back in the devil's face and I say what about that we have to realize the potential of a moment if you think of Jesus we came into the temple and he started teaching prophecies for 400 years were pressing into that moment and when Jesus said this day this scripture is fulfilled all the pressure of all of those prophecies were bound up in a moment those Pharisees and Sadducees did not feel it but In Heaven There was rejoicing because prophecy had come to pass in that moment so I'm asking you today we have more prophecies there's gonna be Christians realize who they really are and when you can catch that Revelation I'm driving a stake down [Music] [Music] [Applause] let us consecrate ourselves [Music] [Music] is Jesus [Music] Christ [Applause]
