with judah to save time we're going to read from verse 13. foreign saying behold that father-in-law goes up to timnah to share his ship and she pulled she put a widow's garment off from her and covered covered her with a veil and wrapped herself and said in an open place which is by the way of timna for she saw that sheila was grown and she was not given unto him to wife when judah saw her he told it that he told her to be a harlot because she had covered her face and it turned on to her by the way and said go to a predi let me come come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law for she said what would that give me that that means come mean unto me and he said i will send the kid from the flock and she said will that give me a pledge till that send it and he said what place should i give d and she said thy senate that brussley and that stuff and that is in that hands and he gave it to her and kim came in onto her and she conceived by him so whenever we see i remember here do you have a promise judah promised and uh everything else and but she asked something else from and later on by tsunami judah sent his friend his friend got there he didn't find the harlot of their seventh one and in verse he was thinking when he was go he's going to send but look at the wisdom of this woman he can't elaborate on me but when he sent his friend avec with the
