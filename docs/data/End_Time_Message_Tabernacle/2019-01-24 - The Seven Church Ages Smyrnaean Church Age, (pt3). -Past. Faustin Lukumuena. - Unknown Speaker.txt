from hold on we need to make sure that children changing one level to another one luckily some funky she's been devalued they will be catch up and following throughout the whole program given so horribly weak people she wants people to the program and I want a parent also to understand that the Sunday school schedule American confront the program to record demos this belong to the parent the

children domestically parents wanna include only developed mode luck was not the purpose on phone so I will stay with the teacher maybe for 10 minutes after service so for tonight we are trying to close up this Mira Church age to solve in Arabic this meal as we read Revelation chapter 2 complete apocalypse a bit will do from verse 8 to verse 11 let us read it together this ensemble and unto the Angel of the church in Smyrna right do you think said the first and the last which was dead and his life I know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou are rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of the things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that he may be tried and ye shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life he that as in here let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh I think the people back there we need to line them up a little bit the selenium is there people playing or what is it there's no jewel about Christine papa you need to know which scripture we are following Kelly kitchen will even seek religious freedom so we are talking about the second church age no baloney second I believe the age of Smyrna like this meal so may the Lord are the blessing to the reading of this urban dictionary kidnapper hole so we spoke about the age of Smyrna the own Polish village this meal and there was a meaning of the word Smyrna everything from the most meal which what our eldest is going to remind us what is the mean that's one who happily if equality if you can show you most men I can stand here for three weeks a month meeting us upon our same thing Perelman de la meme chose if we are not following what will be the purpose Picasso a little bit sister Leah what is the meaning of life occurs when you move me on ah so this is the meaning of smear so as you study something you need to go with the word complete we do capital will help you tella babbu didi as we sow in the message the church age books don't we leave all this manual church age graph one 15-3 Kira to our brother Bonham 7md this is just to recap what the key to this age is most evidently tribulation that's our form this meera church age to this age is most evidently tribulation Vida mala if there was a tribulation in the first age there is now predicted in intensified tribulation throughout the second age limit not ready in tribulation and tone cecum eyes there is no doubt but what the following words of paul applied to the mass of christians whenever they were in the world and in every age they don't move in on important amen so we see that the key the basis of the edge we are speaking about tribulation like level above degrees no no power no fear a tribulation and in the Methodist miniature age 26 but eponymous a homonym B it's a persecuted age God called them persecuted dill is absolutely perfectly T so Smyrna is an age of persecution of Muller the persecution and today we are gonna talk about the 10 days of persecution in Malaysia led to the tribulation because we read in the Bible the Madonna deeb first and the Bible saying that is nobility fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer Nicklin path to achieve a sufrir behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison what a cousin don't want pity that he may be tried and ye shall have tribulation 10 days what is 10 days of tribulation so that's the title I'm taking for tonight 10 days of tribulation we will see why the Bible mentioned that Smyrna is going through 10 days of tribulation so in the Methodist miniature CH h paragraph 26 what eponymous a it's a persecuted eight church God called them persecuted remember from where we started what is taking place from the very first church is gonna continue until the continuous caliphs and so if the believers in the age of Smyrna we're persecuted me on 80 perfectly that means la Valliere the believer in the subsequent church age will be persecuted in the same way the legatus 51c persecuted Romania and the main reason of the persecution in the 8th the second church age has no príncipe de la persecución elysium abilities is to set up darkness people met Roger tenable for the coming the coming Church ages delegate Chris Reeve and you will see the bloodiest persecution persecution appeasement angry Nia was from age two or three to 312 which give you exactly 10 years city with an exact emojis on and ten years as the Bible said liabilities on so one day is like one is like a thousand is how do they say one year is what one day is like one year so 10 days is 10 years of persecution the persecution so this happen according to history this is a possess the knowledge to us and this man this Emperor from a woman Empire to set up a model on PA woman called Diocletian and we will see why the occasion came to play in this age and we on Second Avenue Adnan satiety he was setting up the tone it may tell you the place led to call the next Emperor Constantine who lumpy lost even constant time and you know under constant time this is where the Catholic Church was born see luckily biscuit allocated name so in 325 Donovan thank so the creation of a Catholic Church did not just come randomly like before it was a work that was a prepare enough want Rebecca to prepare a Satan was working under a certain plants that don't have is once a temple on knowing that before I can impose the Nicolette and here could you put some puzzle inequalities before the Nicolette and become a dog tree uncle any quiet Naveen Naveen blood must be shed from the previous church and blood upon I'm said if I'm doing according to history the new leaf to of Diocletian Diocletian was the bloodiest impeller in the whole history it was the age where many Christians were persecuted us why they call this miniature ch8 represented church enlargement what took place here persecution continued until the end lapis aq a continuous color famine and that's why under the Catholic leadership conduct a pattern no Kristin was even allowed to read the Bible a permanent melody because they found the seat of Satan as you see the church age is moving well example whether you have to be mindful to catch the spirit of a twentieth part of the component here they lost their first love for me remove here came a bitterness in a meal to meal and Pergamos Belgium means just wait video male so it was the only age where politics and religion become together la political evolution city if today we can see a lost every political leader who seconded aa politic I am the leadership of the church the convict the legalese talking about a Catholic Church along the revista to that started actually here lucuma see on fait là-bas where politics and religion became one Lola political religion today when they found one boss is improving answered patron it's the Pope

Brownback you see the Pope I'm on the roof a partnership bloom but Tuvalu but they asked him already Monday when you go to their podium you have to call him we have to respect it but what I'm saying I have no problem about it but I'm in a party part as far as me bowing down there is only one I should bow he could not he never met the Pope denies American contribute pop because everybody you meet the party we can continue but we know the condition condition you have to bow before Obama in turn done you name them will it know me tooth every president shocked crazy don't even from face Mandela for when they go there even have to bow they have to bow only before that if today we see all these things taking place suppose it's because what the Nicolaitans has set the could the secular new collide and in the third church age imagine this is where they made the pact the Lucky's not fell apart and then I see a council they say we don't care about the Bible the only thing we care about the second example is what the Pope says and the Pope himself in the problem is Antichrist we don't decrease so that was the age of marriage until a new marriage they follow an age the age of title idea the word tight area means the multimedia a dominating female in they'll move in funky do mean do me not it's gonna be very interesting here Acharya means a dominating female that you video in female domine on and brother but I'm told us wherever you find a female dominating it's a curse / - what Infantino means between malediction and that came through out a church age if you read a letter that I let to date age of tight I realized it you the Bible we say they hate that woman Jezebel Isabel tight area dominating female funky doctrine the cream of Jezebel that's the continuity no silicone that's who that spirit being carried on to the last church age that's why you'll find Laodicea to allow the same means given people's right dude why do purple you cannot tell that you see em something bad your Pikachu's allowed either you be the pastor who try to call the preacher whatever you want to do people will just continue to watch and we're going to do what they want to do continue hatha and you cannot tell them more because I will tell you the video is our privilege as Americans in new privilege on taught America but you see where the church age is starting and we're at hand jacquimo selasa fini people's right this is my right that's the amount one you cannot take it you cannot tell me am i right which whatever you want you wait to yourself I'm gonna do what I have to the seven churches God promised the rapture you approve me long live more so if you don't pay attention to those edges spirit upon spirits having forward whether you will be dead with the spirit of the ages alimony ridiculous redesigned not even realizing what you are doing really is an empathic effect and we thank God in over now few because these seven Church ages but with it settled illegally there were so many name of the cities in minor Asia bokuden on the vid on Lhasa meaner but the 7-piece cities there were pointed it was not appointed by any chance point apart from the meaning of their names from the beginning to the end it was God speaking they did what the continuity of the Spirit of God there are community needed to help his children and no one could discover all these things a funny political until God Himself come down in the last days and give them master to a personal miss example and when the Prophet spoke the message total profit upon us about a seven church a draw us a picture you like they seen a set imagine one day in the midst of the audience toward the end right of the Branum Tabernacle is one antibiotic the angel of the Lord came down and reminded the same twenty Kate this message is the truth and is coming from the Almighty God to be for where they are sitting they should tell us the mighty hand writing on the wall what are you gonna say about the Bible like people being vindicated it don't confirm me and today usually that's what the Bible says blessed are those who are listening good blessed are those who are eating babies are certainly as you are sitting and studying if you really receive it from your heart this is a tremendous blessing so coming back to this muna church age the knowledge did agree with me on paragraph 26 a persecuted a church God called them per security God looked upon their persecutions yeah the fuel of persecution and gave grace to bear it rather regardless of what your turn it was a pop song regardless of what your problem can be reports taking photo problem always faithful to God regardless of who does what exactly perpendicular to look at any man without a pass man will always a failure you know Murata's you do man man will always fail you know as we have to issue a to you we provide only God will take to the magnitude you choose a menage mr.

so what happened in the Church of Smith that was the case in the message the mark of the beast read the seal of God a mock debate eluded us brother Branham said I'm always in connects fog of 39 I got one nerve Titus teachers say he surrounded a city kept them in there two or three years LaVon I do it was wrong and when he did a policy they eat the grass of the trees with a modular example they eat the grass of the tree they back off of the tree of the album the grass of the ground level director and even boiled one another children and eat it without mental parallelism fun design is autre little mangy boy damn please notice bleah you see the way you boil the chicken you boil the chicken welcome on a parallel Lukaku lapu-lapu they boiled the children because they were in the city but he

Tate some of you could be lunch at another pet or your iPad Mini thank God for your Christian parrot Jimmy of people who apparently and I believe they are going to hold you what you can do and to the end mother boiled their babies and idiot we don't find little mangy but a what the persecution calcification they were human being like us remain calm who say more so let's go back to the Bible the end of verse 9 of Revelation chapter 2 the Bible said I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews cannelli blossom the circuit is Kidsongs reef and are not but are the synagogue of Satan a synagogue we sat on now the synagogue of Satan is very important to understand that concept my goodness it was important to compensate concept a synagogue is not a church and if I mean eglise a church is a place where people gather you know and all these young people to worship God but not all the gatherings not to intervene you I have to worship God don't do it you so during the church ages abilities they start gradually come on see awesome they are gathering here most are to worship God the Papa hydrogen but was to kill a Christian City put unity and the gathering move until the niceic Assemblyman Italy Shakuni girls they gather together so assembly and they try to find a way to vellum nominee to kill Christians which we decree that's why brother Bonham telling us in the message this Mina church age paragraph 115 so that's the continuity of the Nicoletta silicon to knitted in equal I eat did you not did you notice did you to notice Ave would the Nicolaitans had got themselves a synagogue can manipulate set up of PNC doctors in a gov'ment so now synagogue is not a church it's a cadre so now in this age they say they are Christian they are Jews but they are not Mendelssohn Baconfest we are believers but they are not many other people we believe the message was until Friday don't in reality really synagogue so in synagogue of satan' this satin so the Nicolaitans has got himself a synagogue now Ali Nikolai the Bible says so here did you notice which are not tricking us what are the synagogue of Satan are they true church public has been pushed out at the on the Nicolaitans Lena : had taken over the plaza and they had taken over the paprika day and pushed out the people that add the holy ghost Cecilia Villa sentence so therefore alone they didn't have no use for them another pretty utility for Earth if Smyrna in Asia alla siciliana and all he knew that the things additional kun is a show that marches grounds would have waited them Telugu Honda mafia Tony I would ever shoot is a massive way so those people of the Nicolaitans is not an equal and they form a synagogue a group of worship a group of God and in the seven church age book smearing a church age paragraph 120 - - what a bottom said is they were not the true church with a palette a big leaves but of their false church because God said my mother's name is mobility they were the synagogue of Satan now their word synagogue is not the same word we use for church Morgan is not fully do you understand let's go to completion when they talk about synagogue policy no good it doesn't mean the church everybody Wrigley's come on brother David in the exposition of the church age analytics position the large villages in the Bible donna biebe church means they called out one civilian visit really oh there's someone's one who's recent Opilio that's the meaning of church people called out let's go kiss on top william softy but the meaning of synagogue is assembly or gathering assembly assembly mom this can be good or bad mood so when they talk about synagogue it's just a gathering few staff assembly moon but the meaning of synagogue is assembly or gathering so as we read in the book of they are not jews were synagogue of satan so this can be good or bad but in this case it is vitam all day because for this are they whose assembling is not of god but of their own self from lollipop would you maple mmm so those people are lost eternally starting with this mean a church age gathering together I found God was not impunity plodded on so as they move to the next church age when I see a crowd a synagogue of the gathering God was not in their unity fun but the purpose of those gathering the purpose of the synagogue was to kill Christians really and persecute Christians and remember is when they've gone Trinity of the spirits in our community as we move today we have a lot of synagogues buku the synagogue you call it Church definitely but actually starting with the pastor his purpose from it is to check over the Jews poop on to the controller to move the Holy Spirit aside metal essentials video cool and him too sit in the heart of the premiums are suddenly curved acquire and that's what you see sub believers if they poked away I think they just swear by their posture you have to love the pastor Amira pastor but the one who sit in your heart we cannot
