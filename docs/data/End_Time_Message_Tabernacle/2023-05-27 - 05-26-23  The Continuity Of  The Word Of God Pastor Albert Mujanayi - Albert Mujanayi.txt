Just Wednesday [Applause] word of God Heaven [Music] changing Grace [Music] pray for Bangkok [Music] setup again tonight in the name of Jesus Christ as we stand up you can take our Bibles don't leave the Machu in the Book of Matthew 27. the system can do is verse 52 53. ie it is the person and the Gravely opened and many bodies of the Saints which slap a rose and came out of the Grave after his resurrection and went into the body in the holy city and appear unto many in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen maybe see it is I try to speak about the law of continuity continuity see it's a law of God through which he directs the universe existence because it's God who created the universe and it's working with all the laws that is he established and when job saw the law of the nature foreign [Music] everything that God has done the man will still be the Twins and nothing can destroy or annihilate that [Music] that's why Solomon say I recognize and I know that everything that God has made will be forever and then that law of continuity brother Branham broke down in three parts continuity is talking about the continuity of the law of nature so that you can have an image about what I'm talking about it's when you see the nature for example when you see the sun in the celebs unless he always Rises at the East and then set at the west and that's the same routine every day he always rises from the East and always fits at the west and that's the continuity in the nature [Music] it's God who placed it for example example and they were Birds who are called migrated Birds they all migrate every time every time winter is coming they migrate is and every years every time when winter is coming they always migrate and God has given their intelligence you're not going to see them fighting each other there's gonna be one Chef who's gonna be the chief is and then the other ones will just come along without even uh discussing or disturbing each other before flying is they all gathered together among the one Chief a man is and those the person the bird the bird uh in which all those uh virtual gathering around him particularly he has some kind of personality and when he's uh he's acting a certain ways all the spirits understands that he is the leader only just get forward through the Sun and then you don't get to discuss or say you know to argue about it it's a law if we come in and when they fly to the group God has given him wisdom to understand or to uh to feel or where is a safe place and when he comes down and all the other birds comes down as well with him it can't be very past and when the winter is gone they understand that the winter is gone and they go backwards and that's Harmony in nature amen and continuity and there is where the continuity is all Gatherings done upon strategy in God's Minds it's always around one leader amen says in the curtains beyond the corner of times Believers will be gathering around their leaders and the Shepherds trying to say just kiddo you can't argue about it God gives him a particular thing and everybody else comes along [Music] because of his weight and God has given him an ability to protect himself who can just adopt a universe so that he can attack so that he can adapt to the winter Ros can leave when winter comes he uh they get together with uh the female elephant and the female is pregnant and they'll even sleep deeply and they can even sleep for months remember Empire [Music] through October and until the winter goes on they're still sleeping and it's still happening that way it's a routine I want to say I want to say to somebody don't compare yourself to somebody who uh flying or going where our system the protection amen God is always a system to protect you I want to tell you a person we don't want to compare ourselves with somebody else God Knows by your name he knows your life he is the one that's directing you amen the mistake is to compare yourself to someone else the other one flies when a winter comes imagery because he doesn't have something to protect him against winter but the other one is so uh it's uh it's so heavy group it doesn't migrate but it's protected amen hallelujah hello the second law continuity in the law of continuity that's what I developed or I talked about Wednesday it's the law of continuity of the spirit of Gods of the action of the spirit of God let's pray the Jew the spirit of God pose the exact gym Manuel continue do some action in the continuity when God is working with you he's doing it constantly amen when God is watering history is watering constantly continuity it's the continuity of the action of the spirit of God I just want to bring you together and read the scripture is let's go to Isaiah 46 Isaiah 46 verse let's take three and four is of Jacob of the House of Israel a massage they vote to origin which are born by me from the belly is which are carried from the womb juice and even to your old age amen I am B I am he Zeus come for three years and even to Old hairs jebus will I carry you it's the continuity of the action of the spirit of God such as what God has started he will always bring it to the end he'll continue our arose it will start uh beneath he will stop blessing he will blessing he will keep announcing that the sick that's why you said David says I was young and I became Old Village I've never seen the righteous beings for second every step was terrific begging for bread God is the law of continuity in his action thank you Lord Jesus amen amen [Music] [Music] and there's nothing what God has spoken to your country here amen God will never fail amen it's a knowledge coming from Heaven God revealed to the believer [Music] that God doesn't lie amen and a good believer is founded is well granted us I just want to talk about it in a certain way I'm asking you to support me to bear with me I just want to speak in uh in a strange way I'm glad there's an elder here you can uh [Music] in in I want to talk about the scripture from the uh prophet and the message everyone ever present water I want to take a paragraph 149. says this is if you can really pay attention and the power and the power that will help us resurrect a um it's in US in this moment in this very moment I want to start again songs the power that will raise us up a place is right in us now amen we are walking away
