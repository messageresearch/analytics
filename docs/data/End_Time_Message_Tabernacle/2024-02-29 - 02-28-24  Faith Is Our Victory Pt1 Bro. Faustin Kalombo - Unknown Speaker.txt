welcome God bless [Music] you good evening okay [Music] um I have been presented already uh I was here many time I've been here so many time usually come when there's event but this time I just decided to come like that to visit you I'm so happy to be here when I spoke to the pastor he told [Music] me I want you to come in [Music] February then you can preach and fellowship with us before the church to move here I was when we were back there I was but here in this building this is my first time to pre I'm so happy and TR to be here I'm a pastor in Boston I know many of you know me it's a family I'm bringing the GRE greetings from the church from Boston would you accept also if I go back there to bring your blessings your greetings they will be so happy P privil thank you Pastor for the privilege uh I know he's my Elder if is behind me even after preaching for so many years I'm still trembling and shaking because he used to be my pastor for many years I came to share with you a little bit there's nothing new it's the message that you used to and the prophet told us the repeti I'm just going to say what you already heard but just the repetition repeat we are going to repeat until the Lord comes I present myself in French I preach in French I preach in English there's no language that I I can say a masteren I've struggled a little bit in English I still [Music] struggle sometime I struggle to decide what language to preach on I I trust the children of God they don't need any language they just need a message you're going to receive the message because I'm just repeating what you already know may the Lord bless you once again I'll ask you to stand because we took time for tonight we're going to read in first John chapter 5 just uh one first one verse first John chapter 5 okay whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the word even our faith let bow our Lord Our God once again we are coming before that we know that we have nothing in ourselves you yourself you created us you know that we have nothing that is why you promised the comforter of the spirit he alone can lead us through all the truth that is why we bow Bing our we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ stand in this moment as we need it let him take full control of the whole church and lead us in the truth because he's the leader we need it Lord when we look at around us all the situation around us we realize that we have no time that's why we pray may you assist us in this time bless th word assist each and every one of us at the end of this service let us feel closer to you as we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ am amen you may be seated God bless you once again I would like to share with you a little the subject faith is our Victory I love to talk about faith because a Believer is a fighter he doesn't fight with the bomb he doesn't fight with a but God has given him something to fight with it's his faith his faith it's your Victory the devil knows that your faith is your Victory he's coming to take away the faith when you have no you can have all the knowled that won't help you because for the word it has to be added to the faith that is why brother faith is a revelation coming from God to have the knowledge of God to have the true word of God to see the effect you need to have faith and we see [Music] today the devil is working to take away fa from people that is why with the manufacture a lot of church only comes by the hearing of the word and the devil what he do he multiply a lot of program in the church taking the the word that ra [Music] faith when activ Church you will notice that that church has no fath it becomes [Music] mechanical and that church cannot overcome the faith is your Victory now when you have you are in the church you see many time people are so happy when they enjoy when they emotion and but when the word comes they're not ready to receive [Music] it notice it's the devil doing placing you ining beleving that you I pay a TI and you think you are satisfied with that but look at at the end things are coming and reality happening before us because everyone will reach the end [Music] your overcome this life only the Overcomers that you will have Victory you will notice that that will only the word will stand we have to pay attention to the word not just to have intellectual knowledge because they are study biblical stud things are [Music] happening witnesses that can recite the whole Bible all the verses just in front of a little trial the forsake to drop it but we see the Bible is telling usth it's your Victory it's your victory and that faith has to be applied by the word I'm going to read brother BR just there's a lot of victory that has been for example when you enjoy you thought you had [Music] Victory thought you overcame [Music] receive the message of your time but your Victory doesn't last why your Victory doesn't last because you just lean on your Illusionist what now I'm going to read it in English they need to project because sometime you might not give is our Victory but let me tell you uh something tonight you on the in and outside of this building you are going to wind up at a destination one of these days that's going to be in the Valley of the shadow of death you I advise you at this hour to prepare to meet the Lord that will have to meet you at the hour you will either meet him as a masterpiece that he has worked on or a floating piece DW uh a d wood to go into your final destination so don't use this life just like a drift around float uh float around and get a better job and to dress better to get a new [Music] television life mean more than that don't you try to use it just to say well if I was uh of them joh [Music] Church Life mean more than that life mean more than to join a church mean more than to have a good job why because one of these day we're going to come to the end we going to the Lord the one we come every time to serve the one we claim that we are [Music] sons and that day you going to find that all your work is is nothing why because you didn't understand that you need to have a purpose when you come to God you need to have a purpose don't just come to God like that you need to have a purpose what is your purpose to coming to God if you don't have any purpose yourself will not be solid because you don't have any purpose you are just shifting up and down you don't have any Focus but said that's why your your Victory doesn't last you can have a victory today because somebody pray for you you have a victory and when you go out the same faith that bring you to victory the doubt going to get you out of your Victory doubt going to get you out because doubt is a contrary of faith and for your faith to be solid you need to have a purpose what is your purpose you come to go to have a good car did you come here to become rich you come here to have a good job what is your purpose say that Daniel when he went to another strange country he was a slave there but he had a purpose he decide by himself that I will not def my faith with anything and he stand by his purpose and we see through the Bible that he overcome Abraham overcome because he had a purpose [Music] if you have you come to the church you come to the message you need to have a purpose because if you don't have a purpose just a little shaky you're going to pick up your Bible and work out in this church they don't love people the pastor didn't greet me if you come here because it's a community you want to Jo you going to walk the same way came says when Daniel had a purpose in his heart and the devil made him Pro prove it but we found out that it stoned good in the face of the angry lion because even if you have a clear purpose your faith become solid there is nothing that can overcome your faith your faith is your Victory and it's going to stand in every occasion it's going to stand in every situation and everywhere you go that faith will stand one day I was coming from and uh in the plane the pilot said that there is a cloud that cannot land in Miami cloud and uh the pl start shaking and everyone in his Corner start singing gospel song start praying I just quiet I don't pray because of the situation I didn't believe to God not to die in this flesh no he promised me eternal life he promised me eternal life even though you are dead you shall live I don't scar to die it can come any time I'm glad that I know him and I don't have fear to meet him because I did my best I can do brother Bram says if you are sincere honest God is obligated to reveal himself to you and when God reveal himself to you it's not a public Revelation it's not a thing we come to show here is is a a a relationship that is in private you know God he knows you regardless what people sayless what people you know your God you may not know all the book of brother Bram one one guy told Brother Bram he say you know you don't know your Bible and brother say yes you are right I don't know my Bible but I know the but I know the I know him that's the main point your pastor can say that you are evil but you know him that's the main point we need to have a purpose for us to conquer because if you have a faith it's for you to go to conquer there is a law of B you don't have faith to relax and se you need to because it's your promise God give to Israel a promise he said I'm going to give you a land and that time he was in slavery and he has just a a a imagination of land that God promised to them that you going to have a land and the land he described that land to them many of many of them they born in Egypt and they don't know anything they keep repeating to them we have a land and they make bricks they work for Egyptian but they repeat one another oh my brother be strong we have a land strong we have a land we have a land brother it's not a problem we have a land and they keep working like the boy today working the Temptation the trouble be and all things but remember we have a promise we need to conquer and one day they saw the land because when God says something is more than truth before God speak the word already made it he already do it if he said that by my trip you shall be healed provide the healing power if you have tonight your healing is tonight if you have faith you get Faith tomorrow your healing is tomorrow fin all the work is up to you you need to stand as a conqueror you need to conquer he G to Abraham a promise you going to have a son and Abram has to fight 25 years he need to conquer every doubt for you to overcome and the God is telling us that your faith is your victory and we see let me go a little bit deeper even in the message my brother my sister the enemy is working to remove faith in The Believer if you see somebody telling you oh you know was a man what you mean we know that God sent a message God sent a prophet if you go to Egypt and tell to the people mes is just a you will not reach the country because he is Joshua when he come God told him I don't give you another message you need to take what Moses said if you want to be successful now when you come to me said you know Bram is a man you want to give me a job that brother bil Paul told me long time ago we were in Canada and he told me there is a guy who told me that God give him give him a job to correct the prophet and uh he stopped I asked him who's that guy he said I told him that he's a good good job I like that job and I was looking to him he said why he said because you will not have anything to do to correct the prophet you would not have it because the prophet is the mouth of God if you tell me that the prophet is the man you want to give me a job for me to go to the message to look the man and to look what go I don't have that intell I take his mistake and God is responsible I don't have the ability me to go the message what is no he not me I saw a guy who told me oh you need you see him he didn't say that's is the Lord that's the husband of [Music] me's husband but to me I take everything that's my message I defend it with all I got me I have a Sunday school that I teach those i t I give a ttle the blind [Music] spot because there is a lot of blind spot in the message that make that people bring doubt in the message is the blind SP to us but not to the message and they told me 1977 is not happen I don't prophesize I predict I don't care what he say but as long is in the message for me is true you want to see God with your five senses no no when God Cur the F [Music] tree that the disciple looked to the tree nothing happened but at the moment the power of curse was on the tree you cannot see with your eyes your it happened and go brother said God never give you five senses to deal with him no you cannot understand god with your five you need God help that you can understand because the Bible says tells us about Abraham that he took everything that God didn't say that it doesn't [Music] exist but what God has said in this hour I us to say to people I'm in the position of P because when you come to tell me this is wrong I turn just around and ask you to whom shall me go show me another message show me where I can go if I can doubt this message I'm asking myself where can I go because before I come to this message I Catholic I was about to come a priest I went to the seminar and I was so faithful till I saw the priest they told me that they don't have God they have their system I have to obey to their [Music] system and I left I went to Pentecost Baptist Church and it could not satisfy me I went to Pentecost Church it could not satisfy church now I get this message and you come to tell me I don't know where you're going to send me again go back where I come from you come just so late brother says when you come to him when you come to God don't come as a floter you will go up and try it and see if it work there is a lot of people they come to the message they come like floter that's why you see many doctr that's why you see preacher they want to go higher they become higher than the prophet they become they they they want just to uh uh amazing people impress impress people [Music] very there is a time for that there is a time you know that we get to the end there is no more time to impress people you need to meet him yourself and you will not get to the back there you read the uh uh the preaching to come to impress the church I come to help myself and help my brother because has to set in as our Victory we we don't have to come like the FL why come here we think that life is just good [Music] fellowship or just having a good job or get help by the ministers get applauded by people they can say that this is a good Christian this is boy all this one will stand but I tell you when you come to God you need to have a purpose your purpose is to live with him forever to meet him anywhere that's why when bam get to the end he said that even though they cut my flesh in peace even though they burn my flesh or they put me in the war when he show up I will [Music] see that's the purpose of true Christian having that in mind he fight against every [Music] sin he knows that he's in love of God brother says I can go out even get another uh wife my wife can forgive me I know she can but I love her de that I cannot do it but if you love God if your purpose is God I think that you will overcome all the Temptation that come it's going to be easy for you to overcome brother says did I not tell you let me I will skip this see uh he may not hard to deal with the same [Music] FL you said when he wrote that he did he did not have my troubles he did not have to deal with the folk that I deal with he did not have to go through the things that I go [Music] through you may not have to deal with the same Folk [Music] he may uh he may not had the to overcome the same thing but he never exclude them all the things we are going through he never exclude them so he said this the faith is the victory that all the world what you going to overcome the world the world is all the systems you need to overcome them when God give to Israel the promise brother say it was the first [Music] promise you need to fight I give you a promise L but they they must fight everything
