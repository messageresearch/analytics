prophets live for some four parables the false prophets are forced against those who are and we have received a true prophet amen amen amen we have to know what the prophet true prophet has told us loser crochet as a rep and we have to stick with that prophet prophet absolutely we have to take our prophet as an absolute our friend so that we cannot be deceived amen amen because a lot of people will be deceived we are in the deception the prophet deceiving is really great than ever been amen amen the power to deceive from certain states it's telling us that the devil came from uh with the name with the name of the church christian notice their false christ amen amen the christian down legalized they're talking about christ the church first prophet probably the prophet they're talking about prophet in the church so deceiving came with the name of religion they are sitting on the church pews amen amen that that means it's the people in the world they've heard the words they've testified to the truth he jumped really about them they took the baptism they came to church now listen to the words and they even say everything to us but at the end of their life are unfair they find themselves in hell amen amen situation is very explicit it's very serious that we can think about it can you listen to it i see that negligence you sitting next to an affair but you're going to hell that's why my brothers and sisters we have to take things with a lot of seriousness amen amen amen the important things that god has given to a man it's his soul amen amen everything else is vanity commander at that leg list there are few people in the church they are my friends sister brothers and sisters in the church but they are going to hell what up in conferences sir that's why my brothers and sisters know some that's in the book we are in that age where we cannot uh uh joke around with the play with the words se le poke it's a time why aleppo because back in the day we took so much time because the message was not in the end because people thought we are in the edge where we have to preach uh every single time when you're coming to church i'll offend you after after nobody can go and really touch the deepness of god amen amen okay nobody that's why a christian has to pay attention to what he's saying amen amen did you say a man can feel that he has reached be careful it's the enemy that's really next to you it's just to uh to finish here are you with me it's very important why are we in this place talking about a homeless and then it was somewhere he didn't know where he was coming from secular what he was doing and where it was going position it's a terrible position to be in in for set the spread the closure you know you don't want the homeless spirits to get in people's in the membership people said the member of shawn that announcing the you have to receive revelation first if you do something without revelation just because other people are sure just because your parents are in the way like this if you're just saying things because people are saying it's not going to be profitable to you amen amen you have to receive that revelation for what you're coming to trump amen amen why only this message what is the second we want god to reveal himself to us because without revelation revelation without revelation to march or something you're going without a break amen amen you know with that even being uh when this church started amen amen i can tell you without being religious just take it down that the people that were here in this church are not no more confirmation because i am a pastor that's what i know because when a person is doing something with that revolution even a small wind valley this stabilization will destabilize them and also even uh will destabilize them interpretation a wrong interpretation in the first interpretation of false interpretation then actor of an action beneath it we'll just shake them amen amen amen amen [Applause] [Music] think about a woman in the bible jesus god has treated her as a dog wow brothers i cannot take the food of it and give it to dogs sausage that's that's not that's why you have to have revelation amen it's true amen to get revelation amen personally may god reveal himself to you personally so you can understand why you are here amen are you with me i was telling your brother a lot of people are coming today they say they thought they're calling pastor my passion are you with me come to the academy pastor when you're telling someone you are my person what the bible is saying in the life of a man there are two choices major choices there's a choice of a woman or feminism she will be me as a female pastor the pastor is told now i'm talking about the truth the truth of the church is the choice of eternity the choice of a pastor that doesn't mean you can do great things that's fine christians are doing this but the important things i have in me i'll give it to you pastor say my name this is my soul and you name and then someone is talking bad about this person are you listening to your question and someone is talking uh he's insulting him and you're listening to the fact that that person is bringing your soul in front of that so that you can be happy and happy amen it was just you know uh nothing the the defund the shots in italy it was nothing second the world is just when when someone is stranded that's when the men is lack revelations just believe that what god has given you is the best amen amen yes sir amen amen the prophet he went to many hotels he said my wife is the best cook a man do you think that everywhere he went nobody looks better than his uh his wife yes yeah certainly they were not yes ma'am i can listen to all the information that's how you have to uh in certain times god decide to bless you listen to me carefully and the blessings are if that's just a sound the that god has chosen for your blessings amen if you're not hundred percent with him set benediction that blessing will escape you say that's how you see people in the church they're just going around and around yeah we can shoot down since i'm in the church i'm not blessed it's simple it's simple observer just observe that person it's not very straight something regarding revival of the bride the bride's revival amen amen amen when you are called to preach somewhere predicate for us preachers says it's very difficult you think you have a heaviness in you you say where which direct direction am i going to get why am i going to take commercial procedure how am i going to proceed it's not very uh amen easy as you are here god is speaking to you you have to be careful and you see how god is speaking right now as i was thinking i was jealous during this i forgot my computer at home jamiron contour or control ally report and now at the airport if you've noticed that i don't have my computer did you have my phone i told my wife jeffrey lemprimant i took the printer and i forgot my computer come up to you how did that happen he said i know why amen the why is that's what we're going to share together tonight sir my brother belongs to me i don't have my own message the message is what you have the message the message is always what the second scripture is it's why we're listening to our house december 23rd 59 amen amen i know how to deal with the time amen right amen no prophet they do this [Music] i want you to remember that what i'm saying i want you to always remember that what what that i say here i don't say that's emphatically the truth amen paragraph five you say it's the best that i know secular de blue category to be the emphatic truth of it i could be wrong just like any other model just trying to explain it the way i think is right do you remember do you understand i'm just trying to to explain the way i think it is right he says this the way i see you brother mike don't call me in the bible i just don't take it from one place amen amen amen you cannot base your faith upon one scripture are you with me it's just a syrian referendum just one reference no no sir it is he says this it is right straight but if it doesn't coincide with the rest of it in there it's pointing to the bible are you listening to me you can develop a subject yeah a really good one the church is like a woman a motive a woman is uh he has a lot of emotions she's been created that way you can develop herself are you with me it is [Music] if it didn't coincide with the rest of the scripture amen you know throughout amen amen and all scripture will fit together if it's right quickly and together it's just like a big gym i'm going to stop here amen amen you know he's telling us the info we cannot base our faith in doctrine our doctrine inquires uh just upon one scripture just to study negativity just once upon a scripture even if he was preaching when it's breaking it's pretty you have to stop you're here you have to pray basket down said to me because in this bible that we have message you know including the the entertainment very techies there are not two truths that are that we need to take consider to uh to believe that those are the truths the scripture said no we have to leave it aside because this scripture this bible it's a false perception of the thing the secretary is a combatant scripture don't fight each other amen amen when they're bringing the scriptures you don't have to uh defend the sound from the scripture before you take that scripture just get you did about the cell called the present what are you saying about the scripture that's been brought to you amen amen because there are not two truths that are foreign [Applause] we are making the prophet a false prophet and we know he's the true prophet prophet the greatest prophet of all ages you believe like me amen oh let's give a clap to god amen now we're going based on this because we're talking about the bride's revival foreign now we are in the revival it's the ego revival that we just read in memphis where there will be uh wherever the caucus is there will it already perish and we cannot eat it amen amen on the mounds of us we cannot eat what was contaminated because it would bring diseases yeah and when did you come to a man forever they're pushing you to accept it are you listening to me get to this moment yeah they want you to say my beauty by high pressure can you wish that group yes sir they want you to make it your own it's become your own demonstration my suffering my uh my trials are you with me yes it shows negative they want you to be uh to make it your own but the brand was saying somewhere that's the devil's language negative everything that's negative it's appropriate they show the negative to make them appropriate to make your own appropriate it's the demonstration even if it's there you know with all the centers there's only two things are you with me all the diseases will die and you live continue to communicate you're not going to keep working with the disease oh my god my brother my high pressure are you with me is the church with me amen that's what we're talking we are from the eagle's revival amen amen fresh a revival consists of fresh food la lu richter a disease exists because of the law of sin it's the law of the devil amen amen spiritually spiritually speaking the same thing denomination the denomination revival that we can qualify as a a crow revival amen amen so or contaminated when a man eats it he will bring disease to him and the purpose of a disease is to kill that person amen amen are you with me you know as you are staying here we are doubting amen amen because uh brothers uh brother barnabas preached something about the inner man amen amen what are you seeing right now it's the experience but there's also a inner man are you with me amen there's not another choice can't you muslim nurture spiritual when you eat spiritual food which are contaminated perished second seven enter yes it will kill that inner man in you amen emma lovely we have the influence of that denomination defined the church as an individual amen amen it's one man it's a man man people who are coming here amen amen they are supporting this ministry with their presence their prayers lord themselves they typhoon offerings they those are the people who have that they have said individuals you now you you realize that a church now the denomination is also someone it's not wonderful as we are here amen amen that the we're just going to give you something that will help us very loudly and our work towards amen towards heaven amen the importance of a pride revival why do we have to pay attention you know to the denominational revival first there's uh brothers and sisters we have to pay very attention amen amen sometimes we look at the prophets brother branham had a mission he had a commission was that are you because of mixing things today and we don't even recognize the woman that we recognize in the beginning across the melange because of mixing things set especially the rare species the malachi cattle of malachi foreign protected by the angel of the lord amen amen you know the people of the world they're copying jesus there's a species that are being protected the bible says the and you can see that with a woman that's what the prophet says when you go inside what is able to tune in it's a way god is giving to a man but a woman cannot so we're going to be able to deal with but it's amazing that's what the bible says a wise woman will build his house we believe the message when we had the president called mobutu many people in that time the president republican at that time the the the president has uh forbid for these are people who come in this regardless of the general in the name of revelation we are fallen amen are you with me church in the name of reference we ever lifted up our barriers amen amen and we have let any kind of spirits among us and today and we cannot even cast away those spirits but we are we are we must do it amen amen demarcation and because he has to have a different situation between person christian messiah has been an exceptional society there's been a people put apart that's the word that's what the prophet said it's a people put a party who's not leaving was the rest of the world that we have to examine ourselves that we have to examine ourselves for what we have become today in the name of revelation you know people god has taught us you know discipline brotherly discipline because wherever there are children of you you've got your very discipline they have to have discipline yes sir today we are tolerating everything the president massage you know with the teaching of the messiah we we became are we going to the presence of god that way think about it are you with was sick amen sir brothers and sisters according to my son because of one life god has forbidden him to pray for sick they say brother brother has to leave everything to uh go somewhere go cry in front of god you know to seek for god's mercy we are ready i don't need the secretary to give scripture the prophet because god the prophet has given us the scriptures the father it's the law of the bible two disciples a real true disciple two red disciples a true a real decision it's gonna be like his masterpiece a man who can read it stand and say that i'm we're just you know we don't talk wrongly about someone who dies are you with me yes sir it's just because we respect the dead okay that's the pastor of god you say oh she was she was a good sister he was a good brother brother and sister let me tell you one second it doesn't justify that person yes sir amen amen are you with me by the person it doesn't justify the person we should pronounce the classes william branham says this your uh your purgatory amen amen it's here right now while you're still breathing you have to progress your soul in prayer is repentance he said i will end in prison and uh the the sermon of god is doing ceremonies to bring him to heaven no no the pressure the priest right yes was that the backbone are you with me i pray the with if you don't if you don't believe it just put it aside [Music] i will ask the same question and be sure that you're gonna uh raise your hand i know you're protesting the sentence so i preach again uh i preach on the holy ghost i finished appreciate you having imagination in the head that's why i abandoned you don't be in imagination the prophet said be certain of god it's on this side but don't get you respect while you're still breathing that you have to be sure you have a message god face to face amen sir help us lord amen say the pain restore the glaze it's not a church affair individually amen yes sir you have to go out from the denominational revival there are people in the message who are still listening to pastoring the denomination you continue our sympathies they really sympathize with denomination the [Music] our children with denominational people emphasis and a pastor will bless the wedding of a sister in the message with a jehovah witness brother no appetizer oh he is a brother you praise the lord talking about the little mouse that really take all those grips it's not the bigger things that you do it's the little thing that you're neglecting just for one person amen amen amen talk for you you have to think about yourself ever since you believe in tradition the message becomes a suggestion it's just a tragedy not just a habit custom tells he was even praying more than the disciples apostles disciples he was praying more than this he was bringing them to prayer him praying he turned around to see his disciples sleeping roughly just you know uh snoring but i'm not a prophet our brandon our prophet was spring more than us here amen are you with me you have to pray and watch and pray it's a recommendation
