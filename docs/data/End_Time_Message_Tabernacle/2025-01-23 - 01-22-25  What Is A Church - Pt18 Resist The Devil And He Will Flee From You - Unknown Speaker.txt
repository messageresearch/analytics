one of them let Glory and Honor be given back to you in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen may God bless you you may be seated a prayer night I'm going to speak a few words uh just to build our faith to what we want to ask God so as I think I announced last uh Sunday also Sunday after service God willing I will have a meeting with the girls 13 years and with uh their respective mothers so let us uh stand and take the scripture we are going to read in the Book of James chapter 4 versus uh I mean you can take uh the reading from wherever you want once you go [Music] home yeah just chapter 4 of the book of James because on the verse one he said from whence come Wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your last that were in your members so if you read uh it's very very important to to show that we are fighting uh just to save time I'm going to take verse [Music] S submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you and I'm taking the thought of resist the devil and he will flee from you may the Lord bless the reading of the scripture may be seated uh this is verse brother Bram said resist the devil he's not going to walk away from you he will not run away walk away but he's going to flee amen amen resist the devil he will not walk away but he will flee so this is a very serious fight so as we are building our prayer um we are not on a picnic we are on the battlefield uh if you look at yourself through the circle I show you you will know that it's a serious battle and you are not going to relax so Christian Life it's not that we are on a picnic to relax brother Bram said in the message a deceive the church by the world paragraph 8 and I want you as I'm reading the quot tonight I have always selected the word remember and highlighted in red in Red so when brother is saying remember that means it's just a reminder remember we are not on a picnic but we are in a battlefield many people just think that when they become a Christian that that's all they need to do that settles it forever as they are a Christian and every is going to come easy don't never get that in your head for I become a Christian to fight fight the good fight of faith I become a Christian to get in the battle lines we are Christian Soldiers and we got to be trained and brought up and know all the techniques of the enemy to know how to fortify to know how to fight the fight and we can only do that as the holy spirit will reveal it to us we cannot take what some other Nation tells us when we go to war some of their ideas but we got to take our own ideas the way the Holy Spirit would direct us so it's to you as individual you must have the Holy Spirit to direct you on your own fight we are not the same some people are fighting over lasting over women some are fighting against negative thought against imaginations against affections and many many other things so you must know your weaknesses and what things you are here to overcome amen amen the way the Holy Spirit Will direct us and what ideas he would give us because he is the commanding chief of the army of the Christian amen amen hallelujah amen and the Holy Spirit in you will tell you that you with the word of God don't look at the circles there is this there is this how can I overcome the holy spirit in you is telling you even tonight reminding you that you can overcome the devil everywhere anytime under any circumstance so you have to take the uh the tools for you to fight with amen amen in the message testimony paragraph 52 Brother start I highlight also in red remember come on sister Faith remember get those C because I will be so quickly uh passing one to another in a certain in the same order I have given them so brother Bram said in the message testimony remember the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime just say just say it is written it is written that settles it Satan will flee will have to flee resist the devil and he will flee from you amen amen that means the devil must run away but he will not flee away if you don't do anything he's here he's in you in your mind even when I'm speaking he's trying to tell you another gospel prepare the next pleas he's going to tell you the next uh thing you know what you know what but don't pay attention to him you have to resist amen amen resist means you have to resist amen Amen brother you have to resist in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever did do notice my remember remember remember now remember this that I make this quotation that the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime any place or any condition don't you look at my I'm younger or I'm old Satan have no distinction so God also has provided his word for you to overcome Satan anywhere in the church at home at work school when he comes you are commanded to overcome not we are going to overcome Satan only in the church anywhere any in the morning lunch time evening time even when you sleep in your subc conscience you have still to overcome means those Attack Of The Devil with bad dreams you have to overcome it anytime even everywhere the word of God Alone it is written will defeat Satan no matter who he is what form he comes in where he's at it will defeat Satan do you believe it so you must be an overcomer if you have been Addicted by pornography all the time I have to see it I watch it can overcome and where you are say Satan I am a Overcomer I have already overcame you by Jesus Christ that day on the cross now that is the truth the written word of God now here is another statement I want you to remember and you you especially hear that so sick sitting here this cancer cases and so forth so tonight look that this is the other statement the right mental attitude [Music] positive no the right mental attitude latitude mental correct latitude mental correct towards any Divine promise of God no any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass can you understand what I mean the right mental attitude ude latitude mental correct latitude mental correct toward any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass that means where you are take a positive attitude mentally attitud positive amen amen that means sickness you have to go mentally positive attitude attitud you are healed toward any God has promised anything God has promised and God is under obligation to see that you get it that's right because he promised it and when God promis there is nothing can stop God because let me tell you this before God could have made a promise he already see this solution so you just take the promise and you have the solution if you don't want to take the promise and take the correct mental attitude then you cannot see anything Bram said in the message the greatest battle ever fought 394 God's Army close up your mind close up your mind don't stop for a minute to think of anything the devil has got to offer you through your senses so Satan can come through your senses five of the body five of the spirit Satan comes always to offer would you look at this would you think like this would you remember this in your memory and in your affections oh you know you know you don't have to love everybody can you hate this one look at this one what he got can you be a little bit jealous those are offers from satanam said don't stop for a minute remember minute to think of anything the devil has to offer you through your senses but remember God's word can never fail amen amen regardless of his offers his offers word uh God's word already promised can never fail these two great armies when the enemy comes in like a flood what is the correct word in French come as is coming today what did God say he will do the spirit of God would raise up a stander against it amen amen if Satan come with many many many attacks whatever whatsoever kind the spirit of God will rise up Stander against it are you one of them yes sir so this age we are living in it's the most evil age never existed because Satan is on the earth physically trying to challenge anyone he come with the physical make you get sick he make you sick also in your spirit by corrupting your mind are giving you all the things when I'm talking about the thing always remember those two those three circles locate where your problems regardless of how how the devil is going to raise up even if he has conquered this Earth in these last days the whole Heaven also is on the earth to fight for you amen amen so therefore my brothers sisters with all that we have spoken don't be afraid you are a son and daughter of God you have the word of God that's the sword God has given to you use it and you have the victory already you know the technique of the devil is trying to disbelieve you the efficiency of your weapon no no no no no he's trying to sometimes you lost me with the ideas also uh what did I say uh it may make you disbelieve your own weapon yeah that's what Satan is trying to do but it's the most powerful weapon and say Satan you cannot make me disbel I have full confidence in my weapon amen amen amen amen now let me tell you let the key now we are saying you have to resist we have to resist how to resist how to resist because if if you try to resist by yourself you are going to fail if you try to resist by yourself I'm not going to think evil this I can tell you it was for myself God has given me tremendous things I was wondering one of the day say Lord and he gave me a dream in that dream I was in jail I was wondering I have a lot of things to do I have to go to church and then I got the message mess Paul Paul a prisoner that's the tape I have been listening to in that tape I got something said you know even the thing we are trying to do I have been pushing the church you know we have to see all those uh uh Supernatural things which is good but God told me all the things is his sovereignty it's his sovereignty yes don't try to force God you just believe the word move on if it has to happen it will happen according to God's Own plan because when we try to force we are going to fall in another trap which is pride ah you see we preach the things look at this it is wonderful but who is going to get the glory if what we are trying to obtain is not for his glory we better stop God deals with people in a different way he can talk to you in dream listening of the word it's wonderful and since I'm feeling like I'm a prisoner you cannot think think on your own you cannot do on your own act like a prisoner you have no more Liberty of your own that's what God is looking for don't let your body let your body your mind your spirit let everything be at the control of God amen amen so how do you resist brother Bram said in order for you to succeed resisting the devil put the word put the word in your that means you must be reading enough you must be listening to the word all the time that your mind is loaded with the word the devil will have no room where to say it will always be loaded it is written it is written because Satan will spare nobody even Jesus on the earth Satan went this guy he did not eat 40 days he must be hungry he said can you turn this thing into bread for two feed yourself do you know that Jesus could do that but he did not do it we have to watch our motive and objective even something you can do what's the purpose Jesus said it is written mat 4 men shall not leave by bread alone brother our life is not about bread if we are living it's not about job to make money you know this is another trap of the devil uh give me those Circle those things we are doing in our life there are a lot of influences influence to the extent sometimes we don't know but we think like we are fighting how are we fighting you see I was uh all the time watching this circle I go in I go out you see all the thing is there and all the things they are outer influences exterior influences influence we got influences even think we don't know that's why our only influence should be the word of God what the word of God say not the influence of the pastor influence the P not the influence even of your dad and mom because if it's not the word of God your dad will tell you like uh son daughter uh you are married but don't forget me it's an influence on you and if you are not prudent the pastor will say the place of the woman in the kitchen the family it's going to move you it's going to shake you I don't say don't help a parent I like also my kids but your influence must be the word of God amen amen because as human being we have needs which is normal if you look here there is no need because we have need we have to to to dress we have to eat those thing are there to help our body but the problem is not about needs it's about want want I want this I want this I want this and if you give that person can be an influence of your life and even prevent you from Liv the word God the pastor need money can he send you to go steal to bring him money no your discernment must stop it in a normal life I have the obligation to feed and raise my children but I have no obligation for myom can help if you don't feed your children they can sue you but if I don't do with my brother or my mother nowhere even if you do there is no consideration we have to be aware of our being and stand as a Christian and resist because we are in a fight amen amen it's fight we need to be aware of everything at work the boss can intimidate you it's also an influence over you you have to work on Sunday you must work and will fire you it's influence but we have to resist because they fight let me tell you a little bit hard here let us take the Bible now let's take uh Ephesians because Ephesians chapter 6 listen to the Bible Ephesians 6 Ephesians let's take verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of this might his might put on the whole armor of God so don't take some armor but all you need to cover your feet your head your [Music] everywhere that he may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil listen to this verse 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood sometimes we don't understand what are we fighting for we think we are fighting the flesh no no the word of God has been given to protect us in the fight even against thing we don't see that's how we have to preach the gospel don't you always think you are preaching the people here the people here are nice people but they are evil spirit which is not flesh and [Music] blood maybe you see something there is nobody concerned here it's not about that you don't see the invisible enemies said but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world you see the rulers of the darkness of this world where are they they come to church you can walk in the church and be visited by certain spirit and Paul said the fight we are wrestling with is not flesh and blood against spiritual wickedness in high places amen amen amen therefore take unto you the whole armor of God that he may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins G about the truth so you have to have uh the truth for B and every on the breast plate of righteousness you have to when the enemy send his attack you have to have the breast plate of righteousness and your feet sh with the preparation of the gospel of peace amen amen you have to put your feet because your feet is wherever you are going and your feet can step on the enemy's missile under ground amen amen when Paul was defining the things he had in mind a big battle than the physical you see amen amen you will see that why the battle we waste our time this this that's flesh that's the flesh the battle is not about the flesh but the devil but the devil has come to this temple in a spiritual way that he's saying something and you if you don't go beyond to discern Satan behind you will have a problem with flesh and blood have you seen people husband and wife they marry for a certain time know each other but have you seen brother you have a nice suit I don't want to touch it but I pretend like this is what you are wearing uh somebody come huh do you know me do you know me but the problem is where is the problem in the normal condition you will never ask wife do you know me but when you get anointed the devil enter he's asking you the question do you know me do you remember me do you know what I did are you understanding what I'm saying Therefore your battle is not against flesh and blood just look at Satan get out my wife you are the old enemy you cannot ask me those questions my Lord overcame you in Jesus name but very often the husband do you know me the wife also so where are you you are in the B which you what did I Doone forgive me because it was a visitation because your battle is not flesh and blood if we can understand that we will be overcoming we will know how to resist if you don't know the enemy you cannot fight so brother Bram said I was reading the Bible now I read verse 15 let's go to verse 16 above all taking the shield of Faith where with ye shall be able to quench all the fiery dots of the wicked amen amen it's the faith that is your Shield 17 and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God amen amen praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit ing there unto with with all perseverance and supplication for All Saint if you want to resist two things the word prayer say the message the greatest battle ever fought brother paragraph 396 we are taught in James 47 I don't have time to read it James 4:7 to resist the devil and he won't walk away but he will flee that means your level of resistance must be so strong that the devil is not going to walk a little bit to come back but your resistance should be in the way that he was so strong that the devil is going to do you understand this step of resistance that means don't resist weakly alol we don't drink in the in our church but inside you like it the Pastor said not to drink the devil is not going to care but if he give you the alcohol you kick [Music] it he's going far this is how we need to stand and resist Bram said but he will flee resist the devil how do you resist the devil the same way our chief Captain told us to do it take the word of God it is written it is written a young girl shall not defile her body before marriage that's resistance and you confess it you believe it you act upon being firm that's how you resist the devil is by the word of God the chief Captain told us just how it was done how it was done change this Stone into bread it is written oh come here on the top of the mountain and show him this is the United States jump over there and tell the angel to receive you it is written three times back to back and then Satan get away amen amen that's the real resistance in the closing to resist res to do the is to do the opposite amen amen he want you to do this I'm going to do this you know I did not have a chance to speak on the affections I think by God's grace I wanted to speak on the the nature of the the soul being the nature of the spirit on Sunday the soul is the nature of the spirit but I think I will take some of the affection so that we can be on the same because in order to resist even when we are praying tonight what are those affections affection means affection your love compassion Etc we have to love one another that's what affection is about but the devil he instead of willing you to do that he's bringing hatred jealousy jealy bitterness to the extend he will put the thing in you and if you don't know you don't recognize those you will say I will overcome imagination all the things affections you don't have any when somebody's suffering you are happy imagine when you suffer Jesus being happy those are affections what is that thing that you cannot forgive anyone that's why as we pray tonight those things negative imagination conscience imagination all the things we have to resist amen Amen brother bam said in the message United under one head in is so in paragraph brother bam said everything that you see that's wrong just do opposite and you will be right do the opposite in question and answer number four paragraph 71 it was a when a person realized he has an inferior complex or some sort of complex should it be if he was the only child caused this in his early youth uh you know some people those influences the way they have been treated or you are born by yourself maybe the only boy with a lot of girls the only girls among many boys that can impact you and the family the dad the mom and they treat you in a certain way you will go like that and sometimes even in marriage you will expect your wife or your husband to treat you the way they treated you because it's a certain influence coming outside only boy only girl fight and resist amen there are influences you have to resist to those things that's the question that was asked to brother Bram brother said take exactly the opposite if you are always wanting your wayen and that one little BR that want to always have everything your way turn right back around and give everything to get to God the other way we to do the contrary if you are selfish and you want to hold everything then start giving away what you got whatever just go the vice versa Vera that's the way to overcome anything is an antidote amen cont amen amen closing thought even if you have been attacked don't give up fight back brother BR was telling a story here to finish in the message perseverance 238 he said this a man here some time ago was telling me said you know a little bit devil about that big stood up before me one time in a dream he said the devil said boo Satan he attack Satan is attacking he came boo no not wo boo boo Boo Boo Boo and if you get scared City he will say boo and you are going to continue to get scared and when you are get scared you see him becoming bigger and you get scared Satan bo boo you are afraid Etc the only way is to fight back if you say boo you say louder boo Satan is going to run that's what brother is telling us here if he said the devil said boo and I and and said every time I would jump back he got bigger and I got little said first thing you know boo and I would jump back and every time go said he would uh he would get back back get back get back go back go back back said he got bigger than I was the devil was getting bigger than I was and he said I know I had to fight him so I didn't find anything so I just pick up a Bible he went to [Music] boo I went to Boo too said he got to get uh he got to get in little that's right said that's what you you have to do take the word of God you have you don't have to say boo but say the Lord be perseverant stand on the word it's truth we believe the word today do you believe the word don't say boo say say the Lord let us stand on our feet with that said the Lord and resist the devil brother it's not against flesh and blood you have
