perfect Eternal peace amen we moving to item uh that is number eight message from Sister Sister Sarah Sani she's she's here she will just come to the for I'm just going to speak from my heart I didn't write anything I'm going to speak from my heart because I happen to be the person that found my sister I don't know how I got there but I did I don't know how I got there but I did and I saw I saw my sister L there ripped the condition she was in nobody deserves to see their own sister like that my sister was killed like an animal even an animal does not deserve to be killed like that so I have a message for szel Gan you killed my sister I had a conversation with you szel I didn't take it I I didn't know what you meant that day but I thought you talked about river Euphrates szel talked to me about D Euphrates he talked to me about Riv Euphrates and somehow I thought him and I were sort of like in the same page message wise because my pastor preaches about r that day he said the last Angel of Death has left river Euphrates and that is why it's drying up because it's out here in the world and it's mission is to kill and destroy I didn't know that you were that angel of death only if I knew that you were talking about yourself the way you said it now I'm adding one W adding one plus one and I'm like he said it he said the angel of death is out the last angel of death is out and he's going to kill and D I didn't know it was you I had no idea you were talking about yourself I didn't know that you were the one that was going to take my sister's life especially this way why did you do this I'm sorry but I'm going to say it out loud I'm just going to say my heart out it's either you tried to take my sister's heart out or you took it the condition that she's in the way you ripped her apart where are you taking my sister's heart you meant to do this you were willing to do this you you you knew you were going to do this because you knew about the angel of death but anyway my main message is I'm not angry with anyone I've learned from my pastor that forgiveness is the key you forgive and move on and move forward and keep working the message that I have for you and everybody else that is involved in this mission you killed her body but you can never have her soul that is one thing for sure I assure you with all my heart my soul and everything in me every inch in me from the crown of my head to the soul of my feet you don't and you will never access my sister's soul my sister's soul is in Christ so all the work that you've done is all in vain it's all in vain and that is what it is and I stand by that because I believe that if God is for me nobody and anything can ever be against me and I always prayed for my sister and that is the word that I used every time when I mentioned her names God if you are for us nobody and anything can never be against us and I stand on that I still believe in that and I still trust in that and I never move from that position that position of God's word I'm standing on that until eternity I know who I am in Christ that is why I'm standing here I'm not trying to make myself look like I'm strengthened or strong it is the god in me it is the god in me that is why I'm facing this situation the way I'm facing it and that is why I am saying all your work is in vain you do not have my sister soul my sister is resting peacefully even in this coffin if you look at her it's like she's sleeping that is how peaceful she is the god in her the God that I serve has entered in her and the God that I serve was protecting her the I said purified her and bled her physically spiritually supernaturally and because of those prayers she remains cleansed and purifies Sanctified by my prayers I believe so much in the word of God the ministry that I Ser that God answers prayers he listens and he answers he allowed this to happen for a reason but the main thing is my sister soul is in Christ no devil in hell no devil in hell has my sister my sister is in Christ my sister's soul is in heaven that peace that I have in me there's no doubt at all in my heart that there's might be otherwise whether you have the heart or you don't it doesn't matter what matters is what matters is my sister soul da is in Christ there to Eternity that's all I wanted to say thank you so much Hallelujah okay we'll be moving on to

uhuh you are not doing that I'm watching you uh thank you so much for observ for respecting me and carrying out that instruction you need to ask yourself for which to serve which purpose little did we know on such a day we'll be here in the Lani family to pay our last respect to our beloved daughter I know I knew her as because my first I gave birth to my first born in 1990 her name is mash and then two years later she gave birth she named her mashudu I was very angry and Furious I said you stole my name you stole my name I want my name back so that was on a very light note little did I know I'll come and pay my respect to her today it's very pathetic very pathetic and it will be a Miss of us not to talk about G based violence and femicide will be failing Mash if you don't talk about that those hands which I said I'm meant to nurture I'm meant to provide for your families not to kill us not to hit us not to abusers that's why I say it will be a Miss of me if I don't denounce gender based violence and femicide I don't know what's wrong with certain individuals I don't know what's wrong with certain men what's going on not all men that's why I say certain they are very good men very good very caring who know that those hands are meant for nurturing those hands are meant for providing for one's family those hands are meant for caressing a woman not hitting a woman or raising a hand against a woman it might be sensitive but we must say it if we don't say it now when and how are we going to say it I'm an officer of the Court by profession I won't dwell into the merits of the case s know very well which I won't get into but head's going to roll I'm telling you [Applause] L he going to roll you know uh sometimes when when when as parents a very very promising [Music] not getting into the merits of the case and we are aware that some individuals are suspects so says our constitution section 35 little do we know we need to say these things we need to say such things I was very angry on Thursday when I came here I asked Sarah mashu opened a case of assault who who pressurized mashu mashu to drop that case I asked them as an officer of the Court who prized Mas to drop that case because my take and my instinct tells me if that case was not dropped was not cancelled maybe she would be alive then she answered I said I thought it was mashu's mom because the media was it was just saying family B women you must never has to sometimes has to come to an end because it might sound sensitive but we need to tell I'll respect a man I'll respect a person a woman and we must stop as a community we must stop as a nation what is that we must stop that stigmatization we must stop it because the heat that particular person is feeling you are not feeling it so let's stop it it's as women it's as women who are saying such things we must stop that we must stop such things and we must support each other this thing of PhD what you are saying what what bring her down syndrome and what what must come to an end otherwise we lose stars like this one now we have given her a title we are now saying diseased M it can't be right we can't lose such brilliant people and keep quiet as if yes we need to talk and the family must heal and I'm really disappointed if the gas you are here you disappointed me because traditionally and culturally you are from Royal Family you were supposed to have come here that's how supposed to be in terms of our culture and tradition it's what because you are supposed to send a person to come and apologize for what has happened without getting to the merage of the case I'm really disappointed more especially that on the other hand I told you who those are my relatives the royal family not not the royal family where the gas come from my aunt got married into that royal family that's why I called them questions because some of the things we need to work them traditionally and culturally he for the sake of that little child because somewh somehow as two families it's so disappointing it's so disappointing you know there are a lot of people whom I called communicated with on on Thursday very very senior people to ensure this case like any other case don't go down the drain especially in where you buy everything even a person's life is I'm because in a person's life is worth nothing there are many unresolved cases of murder a lot so this one fortunately even the case number I know by heart I called very senior people about three and at the same time they responded very positively so so M wherever you are seated be rest assured he going R and besides that Mash is just not just a an ordinary person is a by Blood and you know the powers that the have so you whoever took it for granted is just a non entity that particular person or people are lost you are lost you are lost wherever she is she's fighting wherever they are they are fighting wherever they are they are fighting whoever did this is going to regret I'm telling you you have touched the wrong button and if you don't denounce this thing you you you certain guys those hands of yours you weak you must know you are very weak you are very very weak we you are weak you are hiding your weakness you are hiding your inferiority complex you are very weak so please especially especially and communication is the best tool then you'll heal you know there's something which is just I'm sorry sry what Mash is no more s what that's ending with SH a person's life is not worth nothing we have we have heard and seen she has received so many accolades a shining star very proud of at her age at her age you know she had achieved so much please if there are police officers here let's do our work with diligence because if some of you are found to have in interfered in the whole we know ipit you going to communicate with IP executive director of Ip ipit regarding this case and you are aware as soon as an as as a a police woman or a policeman we

thank everyone of you for coming and support here in the house to I think I was not introduced amen amen so I'm not a stranger in the house know the late father of the house as well here to bury the daughter again the remaining sister and you know the grandchildren and all of them we Fellowship together and our pastor Israel supposed to be here this morning but he had a trust in us so we may come and comfort the family with the word of God listening to all the speeches all spot on really appreciate that what I've seen and what I've realized they knew our daughter very well you know from you know this level called a canel what she achieved in life I know them as well because I'm part of this family but my being this morning is different my being here this morning is different because I'm not going to dwell much of what you have said already everybody has heard but I'm here this morning to represent heaven to talk about something that is beyond our excellent as a human being we run a raise to a certain level and we stop there but we need the one that will take us where we stopped and go further so that's why I'm here this morning not talk about the flesh when I talk about her flesh it really cut deeper in my heart because I I know here so now the best thing we can do this morning is to talk about something beyond the flesh amen amen so the previous night I read few scriptures from the New Testament talking about the life beyond death because we are all passing but this morning I want to talk about the traveling of a soul in different dimension not just Mo because MOA is a spirit a human being is a triun being you have a flesh you have a spirit you have a soul today I'll talk about the soul not the spirit are we together because a soul the real you the real head the soul the real hair smiling somewhere the flesh that we see today we call it the remaining of who she was to bury it but I will focus on her soul that's who she was amen amen so we we read the scripture here deliberately I want to show you something in the Old Testament this scripture it speaks about a woman of endo who had the familiar Spirit who raised had the power to raise the dead when such happen in our tradition we will go maybe somewhere there in the village inquire what happened to our doctor what what motivate this that's how we do things in our pett culture it has never started with us we just read it from the Bible and it tells us that it has happened long time ago and right in Israel right with soul amen amen you know if he doesn't see well he went to inquire want to know what will happen about his future everybody want to know what will happen about him or her tomorrow and going forward everyone of us here you want to know that's why you have the people you consult with amen amen it's for only that reason you want to know what is happening in your life what is what will happen in our future or has happened previously it so natural we see Saul doing it and then went to this woman and he was disguising because he knew that in Israel there is God and according to the law of God you are not supposed to do that and that's why he disguised because he know I will get the answer from there and he got the answer amen amen and then this woman brought him Samuel and this woman had a familiar Spirit but he had the power to raise the prophet of God and here comes samel as he was and Saul saw him and they communicated and Saul tell told him there I mean Samuel told Saul your days are numbered your kingdom is gone it has been given to David you fast you pray harder You Raise Me from the death you pray God is not going to change that thing it will stay on like that because God has done it already is a complete job the complete job job of God can never be Ted at any time it stays like that and forever like that can you see that so we see it happening communication between Saul Samuel and the woman of Endor and Saul get what he wanted and it was the end of the story can you see that so he has the power to raise the dead it was the time God allowed those things so let's go to another scripture we will get there amen amen First Kings chapter 22 we'll read verse 19 23 for for amen amen if you will understand me give me an undivided attention I want to show you something and the last script I'm going to read you will have the answer for everything and what is happening today amen amen if you can read this scripture and understand it it's in heaven here amen amen in the Throne of God there was a communication because the communication up there end up here on amen amen now God was asking you know the children of God the angel while he was sitting on his throne that hey manab is making trouble down there on Earth I need to deal with him but how can I deal with him let's discuss this thing and they discussed and one was saying that one was saying this and so forth and so forth but the other one said I will put the lying spirit in the mouth of the prophets of Ahab you know we trust the prophet so much until we cannot see when they lie to us and then the lying Spirit condescended upon them when he in them they said to prophesy and when they prophesied they were prophesying lies but they were Prophet we need to know the true and the false prophet and they they they they put their ly in their mouth and they prophesy against Ahab they say to Ahab you are going to win the battle but one Prophet by the name of Mah said you going to to th day this one was unfamiliar to Israel this one were famous to Israel but that day Heaven Is Spoken the lying Spirit Came Upon them and the prophesy lie and one will will ask a question why the lying spirit from Heaven because we regard Heaven as the most harmonious place ever but there comes life from Heaven upon the prophet you must know that there is a permissive will of God perfect will of God amen amen then the life Spirit get to them and they prophesied lies and Ahab went to war and he was killed they prophesied Li amen that's why the man of God requested all of them killed because the prophesy lie I'm trying to show you go with God in dispensation know what God is doing at what time you will find comfort in your life there are situations in life we cannot change we may try this and try that but that situation will never change if God allowed it to be like this amen amen my father di of accident [Music] says when okay my father was going to to Amen in amen amen so there was the K that's when I've learned something that time I was still at school and my father had two cars van and a normal private car but that weekend he decided to leave those car in come home with a TXI and go back with a TXI he was killed on the way then we were like what was the reason for him to leave take a now he's dead amen amen often say death is calling amen death calls yes calls you yes death calls you when you are not thinking about anything something happened that could lead to your departure as as human beings with our intelligence we thought you could have taken this way amen amen but God allowed them for what reason God knows amen I'm the first born in the house people came to the house to comfort us my mom and my sibling and the others came there is somebody who perform will assist you so that you can know who killed your dead what you need to do then I said to them my dad was killed in an accident that's all I know if you tell me about something whom I must consult you are just bringing hatred in the house because if I can know that person I'm going to pay Revenge I'm going to hate him so I better not know because God knows why he took my away the other fights fights are not worth fighting for wait for God to fight your battle if God fight he left Stone and 10 but our efforts effort we we we we have effort and try this and that to quench our pain but let's wait upon God God will deal with the situation because God allowed the situation for he knows the answer for every question amen I wish you are listening now Saul consulted we see the lying Spirit from Heaven coming down here but after Ahab was killed those 450 prophets were killed as well yeah amen when when God deal with the situation sit he will deal with it very har and my Bible says they that wait upon the Lord my duty this morning is to comfort the family to know that God knows about the situation we we could have done I was listening to Sister Sarah during the week and she was saying if I knew I could have done this for my sister to survive but knew why he needed to depart we shall know the purpose tomorrow we might know it not know it today amen amen let's read another scripture in job job chapter 2 verse one [Music] amen amen can you see that of God in heaven in heaven here is Satan can you read it again in heaven the place for the Angels but listen amen amen you know when you read the Bible in the Book of Genesis the Bible says sometimes during the evening hours God will condescend it in the Garden of Eden and speak to aam aam are you still okay are the Lions okay are the bed okay are the mountain good are the river still flowing how is things here because I made you God to control over everything then Adam said all is fine amen it was God communicating with his people and there were moment where his people communicate to him and give him some presentation amen when they were busy presenting devil come as [Music] well said people are well not well because you have protected them then God allowed the devil Satan himself to test them then he said job my servant there he's a good man you see I want to tell you this you see we are living in this world but there's always there's a meeting about us in heaven and can I take it further is the heaven that decide for us let me repeat it it's Heaven that decide for us we can't deceive we are in a nor man's land when you are in this world you are getting influence either from God or from the devil you are just nobody you are just a mechanic you need the dynamic are we together you are just a living cop you need something that will incarnate you for you to walk you to speak for you to read for you to eat you need something that will come to you amen hallelujah that is the world we are living in don't think you know better you don't know Heaven has decided about you we don't know maybe next week There's a funeral for one of us here do you know that you don't know that secret with God our sister here God knew that she will depart God knew will be there today but there's a reason behind it we might not see it because always our naked eye deceive us let's go beyond the flesh a little bit you will realize something so the devil was giving report and when the devil bring report he was bringing in the negative report before God and God knew about it that this man is always bringing a bad report to me but God was looking at him he was listening at him he was giving him an opportunity he knows there will be a time whereby he will never have access that's where I want to take you to now what I'm teaching you here is when the devil have access to you to your everything and God knows about them amen amen and then the sons of God present to God we see the devil presenting to God and the presentation of the devil is like this people in fact they are not good and he was right they were not good they need the protection of God for you to beat the devil you must have God in you if you do not have a God in you you will never deceive that angel the angel called Lucifer he so cunning he fought many battles he won many battles but when mik come he gave way because Mel was the ACT angel of God Michael was the only angel that can defeat the Devil and Michael was God in a form of an Angel when God descended in us we become God in the form of a man for you to defeat the Devil God must be in you you must be a God incarnate apart from that you will just become somebody who's living in this world without the mission and the vision and the objective of life amen amen so we see the souls traveling in different dimensions and that soul is the real person the life Beyond this canel is the real life is the genuine life is the life eternal because the soul is the real you and the soul is the one that was processed you know processing you were part of the Soul was part of God processed to our flesh so in our inner most is the part of God that part of God will respond to God amen amen Jesus Christ lived here on this world for 33 years he was in a youthful age when he was living there for 33 years came a moment where he should die for us at the cross he was crucified on the cross when he was crucified on the cross that's when we realize in fact the real life is the life beyond the grave amen amen other people they want to drink beer with a coat he turned water into wine and they stuck there amen amen other people they rely on healing they stuck there amen amen so with those kind of things he performed here on Earth they stuck there I'm here this morning to tell you all don't Stu there go beyond the canel when you go beyond the canel you start to see the real you when you start to real you even in thisal body control all the of the world you look up there if one day you go here in the street of M you see a person like you not your brother your sister the twins will now in somewhere they will differ they would even say you look alike but this one's is that means it's a difference I'm I'm I'm I'm saying the person who's really like you you as you are what are you going to amen amen just if that can happen to you amen amen if that person it's you and you realize it's you you will leave all and follow that person because it's you amen amen so we started to realize the real life is their life beyond death because when Jesus died a lot has happened if you think Jesus has done Miracle when he was on Earth go and read the Bible again he has done many beyond the grave the Bible says I read this scripture previous night I'm not going to read it today when he was going to the Cross when they crucify him they look at body in the grave now that being ISR amen amen when he was in the grave because us as people in the flesh we can see only with the naked eye then we see his flesh there but beyond the flesh day there was a spirit there was a soul and the Bible says his Spirit went back to God his soul is the one that changed Dimensions going there and going there and the Bible says his soul went [Music] beneath amen amen why his soul went beneath to tell the people that you dispel the gospel during the time of Noah during the time of Lord you were rejecting me and let me tell you a soul being his flesh is in the grave his soul is preaching down there and the devil and the demon recognize him that here is Jesus in a spiritual body have you ever fight someone in the street there beat you to BP amen amen when you get home you try to open the door block the door with his food said here I am amen amen that's what happens to the Devil Revelation 12 says there was a war in heaven war in heaven Lucifer and his Angel M and his Angel F and the people there took their stand on the side of Lucifer or on the side of they took the stand there and at the stand you took is the stand that is sustaining you today so God Jesus Michael fought and defeated him and he fell down here when Jesus come here he went to the below then Jesus after his death he followed him below and the devil started to complain now time for Jesus said no it's not a time I still have to put you here in prison what I need here is the key of hell and haters I want to take them when he took them I go up when he get here he take the saints that believed the word of God and he went up with them amen amen that's where I wanted to show you in the Old Testament the devil had access even to the prophet even to the prophet the demons had access to communicate with God even in heaven and put the lying spirit in the prophets but when Jesus came he came between two books between two books between the Old Testament and the New Testament now the dispensation changed if your father is it's your father you will know him even if he can disguise now the people started holding on the Old Testament L they know God has moved in the New Testament Jesus to change the whole dispensation when Jesus come change the dimension he take those one of the devil leave them in the Fifth Dimension and the children of God in the sixth Dimension above now two World apart amen amen the one that are under the altar according to the Book of Revelation and one that are below according to the Book of Revelation got good news to you this morning I've got good news to you this the Bible says the one that the one that used to accuse you amen he's no longer doing it he's no longer have access there is no lying spirit there's no woman of endo that can raise samel let's read that scripture it's in Revelation chapter 10 it's my last scripture we read verse 10 [Music] on the same script chapter 12 vers [Music] 10 amen amen I like it this is a consolation when the devil in the Old Testament as we read he used to go before God with many accusations you say brother is a good man but God this is what has done you say it's so and so he a sister but he has done so and she has done so and so his work was to look for the fault of the children of God so that he can put them before God but this moment this time this last Church age he doesn't do it anymore he has no access to Heaven anymore Heaven is for the children of God only that is why the Bible here says the one that used to accuse you day and night he been chased out he doesn't have access anymore when he want to say something the blood of Jesus Christ stand be between you and God you are no longer a sinner you are sinless you are spotless you are without drink before God because our Lord Jesus Christ di for us at the cross when he died for us on the cross he was cleaning everything amen so that this man devil must not accuse you against amen amen so he was doing that as the Bible says they in they out he was you know taking notes of your life and reported to God but God said to him don't accuse this little one because their face behold the face of the father we are with consolation today so in life there are certain things we can do there are certain things we cannot do let's wait for God to give us Direction amen amen I was talking about Judas the previous night amen amen Judas when you read his history he was a good man we see as a Badman today because we can read about him but those that of his time regarded him as a good man being as good as he are from the beginning he was a devil incarnate amen amen we today we live in another world social medias and so forth you see people espcially giving people monies in the malls others are happy say oh how good you I was starving and so forth and so forth and then when you look at those people for helping someone to have food on the table it shows how kind you are but let me tell you you will find the very same person is not good before God amen amen because somewhere somehow he made ritual with another person to enrich himself and have a lot of money and the condition was you shall give people money and another condition is you will must not even sleep with your wife and another condition is you will leave this snake in a special room there those things are happening don't just receive money and say this a good man that spirit of discernment Judas was there as good as he was but he was Dev incarnate one of the days Jesus were sitting on a table he said one will deceive me amongst you he never thought of Judas they thought of Peter yeah yes he's he's impulsive amen amen so they were thinking the only person that can do this is Peter but Peter had the keys of heaven then while they were looking to one another Jesus looked at Judas he said Judas do what is in your heart he knows the heart of Judas is the evil heart is the is the heart of the deceiver then Judas was like what is happening I won't do it you are my Lord you're looking after me but the spirit in Judas said do it when he took a bread and put in the ditch of Jesus he himself he didn't want to do it but something pull his hand and put it there to make the scripture to be fulfilled I'm I'm trying to tell you that you like it or not you might think you know the things of the world it's not you it's something in you that you cannot control I'm going to repeat this and take it home with wherever you are working whatever you are doing there is something that influence you to do whatever you want to do if you want to love you do not love somebody with love incarnate himself in you and you impact that love amen the reason why God put us here on Earth is to imp what is in us in our innermost because in US is soul and soul is part of God soul is an amate God it's our theop the one that behold the face of the father amen as a child of God you live like that so many times when you look at the people that are rich you wish you can be like them but you don't know what makes them be rich hence I'm saying if God gives you wealth you'll be wealthy respecting God but those that fight for it if they were not given by God they end end up killing people to make themselves rich is the life we are living today and there's nothing you can do because the people influenced by the devil the people influenced by the devil and the people influenced by God when those people meet they don't agree the reason why we are fighting in this world we are living in there's no peace there will never be peace and even the Bible says I did not bring peace I brought commotion the Mother-in-law will fight with brothers and sisters yes like that and the others will you know we normally preach it say it in our house why being siblings fight is us talking on a level you always try to reconcile you always try to bring things together but when you go beyond the flesh the siblings the siblings fight because in their innermost is different people are we together and then when we meet as children of God we meet because of what we have in US amen amen if myself and we go together that means we are in agreement because we believe in one thing the day one of us lost the touch of what we believe we fight Revelation 12 says from verse 7 there was a war in heaven and that war in heaven this Lucifer realized that he can do much than God you know all the assassinations caused by the very close people go and read yeah you cannot be be killed by The Stranger when you are closed with someone he study you in order to overthrown you you look at the president and the deputy president the deputy president want to be the president for him to be the president the president must go on pension if he doesn't go on pension he must eliminate him that why we have many churches because we do not want to be followers you all want to be pastor and if I don't get opportunity I do my own or if this pastor is so old he doesn't want to die how can I kill him I say they that wait upon the Lord just wait for God to work things for you David was up in the mountain there being forsaken by his own Nation being anointed by God himself but God dealt with the situation Saul was killed absum was killed David became the king he never fought them he did not kill them he just keep on praying for them he keep on saying ABS my son why you die before me I was supposed to be the one that you supposed to be the one that will bury me but now I'm buing you so the anointed man of God I love David so much he relied on God he let God do the work for him he didn't want to take things to the extreme and God fought all the fights of David they that wait upon the Lord amen amen and God made his kingom stronger and strong until all the kings we had in Israel until all the kings we there was never this one like David until the Bible says God loved David so much and David was the man after the heart of God may God richly bless amen amen let's sing a song and proceed to the Grave bu the remaining of our sister may the family of be comforted amen amen whatever is going to happen from here going forward put God first amen amen if the law take its cause the law take its CA as a family you must just say according to the will of God just relax in the Lord I've seen many death cases the person you love the most depart after his or her departure the next week we bury you because you took it so much in your heart it bed you until you can't think until you can do everything the next moment you are dead but they that wait upon the Lord May their family be comforted we are praying for you we are praying for the situation we know she has left a threeyear old daughter the mother and the sister we all know that but let God do everything according to his will you'll never go wrong as we to our feet am amen [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] keep hearta [Music] [Music] j [Music] [Music] j p [Music] now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh oh [Music] amen I don't know I've just had Elder from b or if they Among Us I just heard they are coming if they can come and close the service
