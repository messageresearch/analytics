[0:45] house she couldn't

[0:51] by her aunt something like
[0:55] that okay they helped her walked her
[0:58] into
[1:01] my
[1:01] house now I said to her now I'm going to
[1:05] preach for you
[1:07] to pray for
[1:09] you if you believe you'll be
[1:13] healed if you can believe because I
[1:18] believe now you also Must
[1:22] Believe amen amen then while I was
[1:27] talking H she asked for the restroom
[1:32] and uh I I could see
[1:35] that she was managed to stand up on
[1:42] yourself but the
[1:44] husband still mindful
[1:50] of yes and uh he he he tried to hold
[1:56] her and I said no just leave her
[2:00] but anyhow he
[2:03] insisted because that thing was still in
[2:07] his that if he she can try to do it she
[2:11] will drop down so I have to help so I
[2:15] just left them like
[2:17] that by the time we finished I prayed
[2:21] for her and as they walked out H she
[2:25] could
[2:26] walk amen amen now the thing is
[2:31] before I prayed for
[2:33] her already she was
[2:36] healed why
[2:39] amen she believed the word
[2:42] I I spoke to
[2:46] her the healer is the
[2:52] word you
[2:55] know
[2:58] sometimes uh if if if a person
[3:02] believes I can say to to him or
[3:07] her if he
[3:08] says I'm sick like I did in Cameroon
[3:14] very yeah brother was there a sister
[3:21] said her business is to sell fish Fri
[3:24] fish and so
[3:25] forth said pastor my hand is this this
[3:28] this
[3:32] I I I've got the photos of her
[3:37] children she gave me the photo of her
[3:41] children said you keep my
[3:45] children now the following day we
[3:48] driving somewhere else to the
[3:51] Sea when we just h a brother the the
[3:57] brother who led us there
[4:01] he asked he asked asked just to check
[4:04] the
[4:06] sister where she is doing her business
[4:10] now when she said to me my hand is so
[4:14] so I said what I just hold my hand I
[4:19] said you are all right
[4:23] don't it is because I saw the sister
[4:28] that she believed
[4:33] me now you listen she didn't believe me
[4:37] as
[4:40] God she believe the way that I spoke
[4:44] [Applause]
[4:46] to
[4:48] amen because why God said to brother
[4:54] B people to believe
[5:00] amen amen you know H
[5:04] because uh they come to the
[5:08] prophet are
[5:11] believing okay amen but now God wants
[5:15] them to
[5:20] locate to believe God where he
[5:26] is to believe him from where he is
[5:33] amen amen it will be a better
[5:37] thing as it was a better thing for the
[5:41] human
[5:42] beings God knew that the best thing is
[5:47] to become like
[5:51] them
[5:53] because H is then I'll
[5:56] be accepted
[6:00] I must become
[6:04] like amen amen one time before he took
[6:09] that form as
[6:11] Jesus he was on the
[6:14] mountain didn't the people run
[6:18] away and yet they said to
[6:21] Moses uhuh we can also see
[6:24] God we also want to see God
[6:29] all the time it's
[6:35] you no give us a
[6:40] chance he reported to
[6:43] God that the
[6:45] people uh they are
[6:49] protesting they want to H
[6:53] privatize this
[6:55] thing amen so God said to Moses
[7:02] let
[7:07] amen running away from the mountain they
[7:10] even
[7:12] said it is better Moses that we hear
[7:15] from you amen amen you see amen now H
[7:22] God was closer to
[7:27] them okay amen
[7:30] all right but they wanted to overtake
[7:34] and overrun
[7:37] Moses thinking that they will come and
[7:40] stand before God and say yeah we have
[7:43] come ourselves now because Moses is
[7:45] always coming alone
[7:51] here now we are here ourselves they
[7:54] couldn't reach
[7:56] him the only way they could reach him
[8:00] that's when he is in
[8:03] Moses
[8:05] amen otherwise they didn't reach
[8:10] him even today the same
[8:15] thing amen amen you couldn't reach the
[8:18] seven
[8:19] SE until they were in
[8:25] brother when they are in aen
[8:32] because God dwells in the
[8:35] sture of
[8:38] amen
[8:42] amen and if you can see who God
[8:47] is then you'll be able to see what kind
[8:50] of men he has
[8:56] made okay amen oh let me finish my
[9:00] statement
[9:01] amen um the reason people can't get
[9:09] healed is because they only have an
[9:12] intellectual view of
[9:18] it what their mind
[9:23] conceives but the mind will
[9:27] reason it can not be oh sorry
[9:34] Sor okay let me go where it you'll
[9:40] understand all right like somebody is
[9:43] prayed
[9:47] for and you say Jesus Christ has healed
[9:52] you now he listens from the
[9:56] mind that that pain is still there amen
[10:00] amen amen so now he will keep that
[10:05] pain in his
[10:07] mind and as long as he's keeping the
[10:10] pain in his
[10:12] mind the pain will remain in his
[10:17] toe amen amen and until he let go and
[10:21] believe what the word has
[10:26] said because if the the word says you
[10:29] are
[10:30] healed it is like let be
[10:36] light amen amen and so now he says now
[10:41] listen this where I was
[10:44] coming uh when once that faith comes
[10:48] down into the
[10:53] compartment down here in the
[10:57] compartment it will never
[11:02] amen amen so once it is in the
[11:10] compartment there is the reason people
[11:13] doesn't get where they should
[11:20] be this
[11:22] morning the people are struggling
[11:26] striving but they don't reach
[11:31] the they don't get where they should
[11:37] be
[11:46] amen
[11:52] with or whatever like when someone has a
[11:55] dog on a leash yeah on a leash this is
[11:57] the word I want on
[12:00] Le then sometimes the dog would would
[12:04] like to
[12:07] attack maybe another dog but because it
[12:10] is on the
[12:12] leash amen it will
[12:14] run up to
[12:17] here because the
[12:20] owner is holding tight on the other
[12:24] side so but it will run but he will pull
[12:28] it
[12:30] you get what him Satan does the same
[12:33] thing he can put you on the
[12:37] Le you come and say Jesus Jesus
[12:43] Jesus so you can't just reach the
[12:48] place now you remain with a
[12:55] wishire but you don't reach it
[12:59] amen
[13:05] amen sing closer goder to God now it's
[13:10] not just to be
[13:11] closed no it's to reach the place know
[13:15] the Bible
[13:17] says he God says he who finds me finds
[13:25] life and it says seek the Lord and find
[13:33] him instead the people are finding
[13:37] churches it says seek the Lord and find
[13:44] him okay
[13:46] amen uh here the last thing it
[13:52] says but when once that faith comes down
[13:56] into that compartment
[14:02] that means the faith must come in the
[14:07] compartment which is the
[14:11] soul not in the
[14:14] mind but in the
[14:16] soul
[14:18] then there will never be a
[14:22] question because there the faith can
[14:27] bloom amen am if you can hold the
[14:31] seed close to the
[14:33] ground it won't
[14:36] germinate you must bury
[14:40] it in the ground amen now if you you you
[14:44] you you you you have your uh
[14:49] faith and you keep it in the
[14:52] mind it won't bring results
[14:57] [Music]
[14:59] it becomes just a
[15:02] belief I
[15:04] believe amen but what you believe must
[15:12] happen you can't just
[15:15] say I believe that men should
[15:19] eat and yet you don't eat you are
[15:23] [Applause]
[15:25] fasting sometimes you faint because of
[15:27] hunger
[15:35] must
[15:37] eat but you're notating amen so it's a
[15:41] believe without the
[15:45] manifestation if you believe a thing
[15:47] then you do
[15:49] [Applause]
[15:51] it if you believe that God Christ Is A
[15:56] Healer then you you get healed because
[16:01] you believe that he is the
[16:04] Healer amen
[16:08] amen this is the main thing there is the
[16:12] reason
[16:13] people don't get where they should
[16:19] be Monday to Monday they are just the
[16:25] same it is like if you find a preacher
[16:29] who's getting
[16:32] nowhere amen
[16:34] amen every
[16:37] day repent
[16:40] repent repent that's
[16:46] all as I said last
[16:49] night in
[16:51] London
[16:53] um they uh gave a title
[17:00] how I don't know maybe brother can
[17:02] remember it was about the Holy receiving
[17:05] the holy ghost or
[17:08] something
[17:11] today now ministers were supposed to
[17:15] dwell on
[17:17] that yeah they were supposed to
[17:21] do so
[17:23] now I brought this
[17:26] message uh from the spoken
[17:30] words I've shown it yesterday that we
[17:33] have seven Church Ages which is the work
[17:36] of the Holy
[17:38] Ghost and the prophet says throughout
[17:41] the seven churches he is the holy
[17:45] ghost from the first churches to the
[17:48] seven
[17:50] Church it stops
[17:53] there amen
[17:55] amen the Holy Ghost has done its work
[18:01] [Applause]
[18:03] the Holy Ghost was responsible for the
[18:05] church
[18:08] ages that's why throughout the Holy
[18:11] Ghost throughout the church ages am it
[18:14] says he who has an
[18:16] ear let him hear what the spirit
[18:20] says to the
[18:24] churches now if you go beyond the seven
[18:27] seches
[18:29] do you find that no it's
[18:33] beyond all right now maybe I'm trying to
[18:37] talk about
[18:39] this H the brothers asked a
[18:43] question
[18:49] everywhere okay don't
[18:51] worry we'll F
[18:54] ourselves this
[18:57] question by
[18:59] if then the seven seal you
[19:02] say brings him to
[19:07] the and uh Redemption is
[19:11] over why are we still baptizing the
[19:19] people you are also asking the same
[19:24] question now listen The Book of Daniel
[19:28] also says
[19:30] Daniel
[19:32] Daniel
[19:34] um every one of your
[19:39] people will be found written in the
[19:45] book everyone whose name shall be found
[19:48] in the
[19:50] book shall be
[19:55] saved and at the end it says in the
[19:58] books were
[20:02] open so he
[20:04] judged according to the names in the
[20:07] book so brother says you are not safed
[20:17] today
[20:20] no you were saved
[20:24] before that is the word of God
[20:27] [Applause]
[20:29] I'm going to read it to you that is the
[20:31] word of
[20:32] God you were saved
[20:37] before that's
[20:40] why I see parents you know our children
[20:44] are are they are
[20:50] children now parents
[20:53] sometimes even if a child
[20:56] can do something wrong
[21:00] they will try to hide
[21:03] it amen
[21:06] am now you who tries to bring it to
[21:08] light you get a
[21:13] beating okay amen they want they don't
[21:17] want their children they don't want
[21:19] their children to be
[21:21] exposed but the Bible says the says if
[21:25] you reveal sin
[21:28] are
[21:30] wise and you'll be
[21:35] cleansed amen he who hides his
[21:38] sin is not
[21:41] wise he who hides his child
[21:48] sin amen amen now you find now you see
[21:53] children you can't pray for that child
[21:55] because
[21:59] the mother is hiding the sin of the
[22:02] church okay amen but the wise
[22:06] mama is the one who brings the child and
[22:09] say this child has seen
[22:13] pastor this child that's a wise a wise
[22:18] mama and she will save the
[22:23] child now what I'm trying to come to is
[22:26] this
[22:27] one uh
[22:29] the people they want their relatives to
[22:32] go to
[22:35] heaven they want their parents to go to
[22:38] heav they want their children to go to
[22:42] heaven amen amen there's
[22:45] a an gospel artist
[22:50] Inland one of his songs
[23:00] he was not believing
[23:13] God his
[23:15] s he didn't want to go to church not
[23:19] believing God at all amen
[23:21] amen the he
[23:34] amen when you want to hear people
[23:36] talking lies go to the
[23:41] funerals a man being shot by the police
[23:44] bus

[24:07] heaven they say greet them
[24:10] there and they even call him the angel

[26:56] amen now he said
[27:00] when he is
[27:03] predestinated when he dies as a child
[27:06] predestinated
[27:10] predestinated it's not like him he was

[27:39] the prophet says he's a child's nothing
[27:42] he'll go to heaven
[27:45] provided his or her name is
[27:48] [Applause]

[28:33] given you see it's just a wish
[28:38] know that maybe he wishes that he can
[28:43] also
[28:44] give the
[28:46] say it's only those whose names were
[28:49] found written in the book that will be
[28:53] saved not because he is a child of a
[28:56] pastor that's right
[28:58] was struggling with her children
[29:03] with
[29:05] theet he was struggling with his own
[29:09] children okay
[29:13] amen you want to tell me that a prophet
[29:15] must give birth to a
[29:18] prophet now the other time he comes so

[29:29] prophet or he's a prophet he said

[29:59] something like
[30:01] that I said the prophet say a
[30:04] prophet is a

[30:37] seeing in me this
[30:40] people amen
[30:44] amen all
[30:49] right now the books of the Prophet you
[30:53] must be careful what you reading about
[30:54] Hallelujah I was testifying one day
[31:00] the people the Bible is it Revelation
[31:06] 7 it says John saw
[31:12] multitudes coming from the
[31:16] tribulation and they were given white
[31:20] robes
[31:22] amen uh the first group he saw was the
[31:25] Jews
[31:28] so he recognized them but then he saw
[31:32] another
[31:34] group and he say its
[31:37] multitude
[31:39] Nations coming from the
[31:42] tribulation and brother B they asked
[31:45] brother BR is that the
[31:49] bride he said
[31:51] yes amen amen then after that when the
[31:55] seals were open
[31:58] then brother Bram said that is not the
[32:01] bride because the bride is not coming
[32:04] from the
[32:09] great you see the thing but you have the
[32:13] people today still sticking to that the
[32:17] bride from the coming from the
[32:20] tribulation nobody I can prove to
[32:25] brother amen amen so you you need to
[32:29] follow the
[32:34] prophet so now I was just testifying
[32:37] about
[32:38] it when the brothers kept
[32:42] silent they were looking at me in a very
[32:45] funny
[32:46] way because they were preachers of the
[32:49] same
[32:50] thing they were the preachers of that
[32:54] now one brother was
[32:56] laughing we were petur
[32:59] laughing now I also wondered why this
[33:02] these others look so
[33:07] sad
[33:13] says I won't name the people but one of
[33:17] our beloved Brothers here was
[33:21] preaching he even asked us to sing a
[33:24] song
[33:28] now who are these
[33:34] ones they coming from the trations of
[33:38] the world and even cry when they
[33:43] sing of Christ just of the tribulations
[33:46] amen amen
[33:51] now he says we even sang that song
[33:57] God was say repeat
[33:59] it it says where are they coming from
[34:02] from the tribulations of the
[34:05] world Prophet says I the bride of Christ
[34:08] that is not the bride of
[34:09] [Music]
[34:10] [Applause]
[34:12] Christ the tribes he has the the tribes
[34:16] of Israel he has
[34:19] seen and the
[34:21] multitudes that's during the tribulation
[34:25] period of which brother say
[34:29] 144,000 144,000 is called out during
[34:33] that time and the remant of the
[34:37] Gentiles those who missed the
[34:41] Rapture but still they will
[34:44] keep
[34:46] themselves and God will reward
[34:50] them amen amen now it says he will give
[34:54] them white
[34:56] robes but he says H they will never not
[35:01] be in
[35:03] Jerusalem they will recite
[35:07] outside amen because they don't come in
[35:09] the first
[35:11] resurrection they were not taken up in
[35:13] the
[35:15] Rapture but they were just good
[35:18] people not perfect
[35:20] people so God gave them
[35:24] robes and said you saw me when I was in
[35:29] you saw me when I was those on his right
[35:33] hand at the Judgment
[35:37] through hey you must read the word of
[35:40] God Amen that is not the
[35:43] bride he says some like goats on the
[35:47] left and some like sheep on the right
[35:52] then he shall say to the
[35:53] Sheep you've seen you you you you you
[35:57] saw me me when I was in jail you saw me
[36:01] when I was
[36:03] hungry you saw and then the prophet says
[36:07] that is the people who has missed the
[36:13] Rapture but because of their good
[36:17] works amen because the bride of Christ
[36:21] is not saved by the good
[36:24] words she is predestinated
[36:29] that's the
[36:34] difference
[36:37] amen when you put it in
[36:41] there
[36:43] compartment then no
[36:46] question it
[36:51] be when
[36:54] Aon when the the RO of Aon
[36:59] was put in there together with the other
[37:02] rods the the aon's rods
[37:07] bed amen amen so you must put it in the
[37:14] compartment okay amen
[37:20] right I was here I was
[37:26] saying the
[37:28] Jews M at
[37:30] him because he said I am the bread that
[37:34] came from
[37:37] Heaven said
[37:40] oh is this not the son
[37:43] of he is
[37:49] Jesus is not this
[37:52] Jesus verse 42
[37:54] vers2 this is Jesus Son of Joseph who
[37:57] father and mother we
[38:01] know now how come he says he's coming
[38:04] from Heaven all right
[38:10] because the person they can believe is
[38:12] from
[38:14] God is the one that they can see him
[38:16] coming down coming down and then
[38:18] stepping
[38:20] down also saw him we Are
[38:25] Witnesses one they can believe this
[38:28] because but the one who from
[38:30] Heaven
[38:35] superal he comes from into the he
[38:40] enters brother says
[38:44] Abraham saw
[38:46] Elohim when he stepped into
[38:51] flesh because Elohim was a hello of
[38:54] light so he followed the hello of light
[38:59] he saw it stepping into
[39:03] a
[39:05] amen then he knew
[39:07] that elim is
[39:12] here
[39:14] but he
[39:16] couldn't say that to to his
[39:20] neighbor he he couldn't convince
[39:24] somebody when Elohim is in his house
[39:28] and he
[39:36] eating are you referring to this man
[39:39] amen
[39:40] amen now when they look they
[39:46] see now the difference is Abraham saw
[39:51] the
[39:53] supernatural because before he stepped
[39:56] into the natural
[40:01] John saw the
[40:03] supernatural before he stepped into the
[40:08] natur you see amen that's how they knew
[40:11] him and John said I bear record
[40:16] this and his record he says the one who
[40:20] has sent
[40:22] me said to me
[40:28] the one I will see light abiding upon
[40:30] him that's him you see because the
[40:34] prophet tells you he he looks he looked
[40:39] ordinary like any other
[40:41] person now the people couldn't see
[40:46] God because he was in his human
[40:52] form
[40:55] form now they couldn't see
[40:58] God now even people today they cannot
[41:01] see God I will say to you you are
[41:06] blessed if you can see
[41:09] God in
[41:12] a
[41:14] okay I I will read you something
[41:17] here amen
[41:20] amen
[41:21] and somewh so blessed Peter
[41:27] says where where shall we go because the
[41:30] words of eternal life are
[41:33] rened so they see they saw a the man
[41:41] God uh the prophet says a mighty God
[41:45] unveil before us us this old script page
[41:50] 13 God back in the days of the Old
[41:53] Testament we find that
[41:57] after he had appeared to his people in
[41:59] different
[42:03] forms different
[42:05] forms he veiled himself behind old
[42:09] Badger
[42:13] skins hid him behind the Skins at his
[42:18] Mery
[42:22] seat then he says but by faith Israel
[42:26] knew that he was back
[42:34] there they knew he was
[42:38] there amen so he says which was a great
[42:45] secret to
[42:47] Israel for Israel to know
[42:50] that God is behind this bger
[42:55] skin it was a great
[42:59] secret amen amen so that's why they used
[43:03] to come
[43:04] there even today they come to the
[43:07] Wailing
[43:09] Hall go there and worship there because
[43:13] they believe that God wants dwell in the
[43:16] holy of
[43:18] holies in this
[43:21] Temple now they go to the ruins
[43:25] there and they worship
[43:28] there
[43:30] today the
[43:32] Jews amen amen and then you can't
[43:36] convince a
[43:37] Jew if you are a
[43:40] gentile no they are waiting for Moses
[43:43] and
[43:45] Elijah then they will convince
[43:48] them and the tribulation when the
[43:50] tribulation tribulation take
[43:54] place now he says
[43:57] H they believe that God was there behind
[44:00] the bger
[44:02] skin now you know in the Old
[44:05] Testament to enter behind that skin was
[44:11] death so they were supposed to worship
[44:14] this side of the
[44:16] skin knowing that God is on this
[44:20] side but to enter that side was
[44:27] then it says now to stay away from it is
[44:33] death
[44:39] today to enter into his glory was
[44:44] death now to stay away from his glory is
[44:52] death do you know his
[44:55] glory when he he prayed he
[44:59] said glorify me with the glory I had
[45:04] with
[45:05] you before the foundation of the
[45:09] world and again he said glorify
[45:15] them okay now we want to
[45:19] close but we are here now if talking
[45:23] about the sture of a man
[45:27] how God dwells
[45:30] there
[45:32] uh the stature of a
[45:35] man is in a
[45:38] threefold the body body spirit Spirit
[45:42] Soul so God
[45:45] dwells in a St of a
[45:50] man all right amen body body spirit
[45:54] Spirit soul the soul amen am now that's
[45:58] why the prophet says when he died
[46:03] Jesus he said father receive my
[46:08] spirit and the body was in the
[46:11] grave and the soul went to the lower
[46:14] parts of the
[46:18] earth you know they separated like
[46:22] that and on the day of the
[46:25] Resurrection the Spirit came and picked
[46:29] up the soul and picked up the
[46:33] body it's a
[46:36] threefold resurrection
[46:39] form amen amen the same with you your
[46:44] spirit will pick up your
[46:46] soul Souls that are
[46:49] in no no
[46:54] noen under the altar
[46:58] so the souls are
[47:00] there the spirit with
[47:04] God now the day of the Resurrection your
[47:08] spirit if then you are a dead that
[47:11] time then your soul is in the six
[47:16] Dimension and the spirit is in God God
[47:20] dwells in the seven
[47:22] diens so at the day of the
[47:25] Resurrection The
[47:27] comes that's why he says he who believes
[47:30] in
[47:31] me I shall resurrect him at the end of
[47:37] time that the spirit will come and pick
[47:40] up the soul that is the the six
[47:44] Dimension and
[47:47] together pick up the
[47:49] body and you come back
[47:54] again okay okay okay
[47:57] okay now I'm here God dwells in the
[48:06] St I can read to you that when the
[48:11] Samaritan
[48:13] woman she was waiting for the
[48:16] Messiah to come amen she went from this
[48:20] church to that
[48:22] church and uh
[48:26] the churches couldn't keep
