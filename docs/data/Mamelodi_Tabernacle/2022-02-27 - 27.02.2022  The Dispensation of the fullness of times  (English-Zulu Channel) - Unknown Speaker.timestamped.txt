[44:17] then there is one
[44:19] year that i want to read
[44:23] this one comes from tabisso john matiba
[44:30] he was involved in an accident
[44:34] on the 25th of february 2019
[44:38] at mulatto road
[44:40] it was a head-on collusion
[44:44] he was on duty driving i understand it
[44:47] was a cash van
[44:49] and he lost control and went to another
[44:52] line where
[44:54] it was a head-on collision with the bus
[44:58] so he was admitted at mulberry hospital
