[1:48:44] something amen because the prophet of
[1:48:47] God

[1:49:02] um we that's
[1:49:07] why always when
[1:49:10] we we
[1:49:13] meet you know the first thing I was
[1:49:15] looking
[1:49:18] at was
[1:49:20] that the prophet of God speaks
[1:49:25] of as being the
[1:49:32] blood amen amen
[1:49:35] amen
[1:49:37] and I look at it

[1:49:46] Prophet we are the
[1:49:49] blood amen amen
[1:49:53] yes not just the
[1:49:57] blood but the blood of the
[1:50:02] Son of

[1:50:08] sin because you
[1:50:15] are amen
[1:50:17] amen God is worshiped by the blood
[1:50:25] that's why we the
[1:50:30] Gentiles before we could come
[1:50:34] in he had to die
[1:50:36] [Music]
[1:50:39] first in order
[1:50:42] that he should receive us as his blood
[1:50:50] amen you know of your your

[1:51:28] this it's not like
[1:51:36] water someone has spilled water but the
[1:51:41] blood blood can this
[1:51:46] be that's why

[1:57:50] eternal without a
[1:57:54] beginning you say brother I was
[1:58:01] born amen amen I began
[1:58:05] there but I'm we are talking about
[1:58:09] eternal
[1:58:12] life where do you find the beginning of
[1:58:15] eternal
[1:58:19] life you are born a human being
[1:58:25] but after

[1:58:35] in you are born for a
[1:58:40] purpose not just
[1:58:44] born amen amen amen it was born
[1:58:52] uh that was the the purpose and the
[1:58:55] promise of
[1:58:58] God because before you were
[1:59:02] born there was this strip of
[1:59:07] blood waiting for to take a a
[1:59:14] body you find women like the Samaritan
[1:59:20] woman she said I
[1:59:29] know I know that Messiah
[1:59:33] coming how do you
[1:59:37] know because she is
[1:59:41] part that
[1:59:43] came like a
[1:59:48] forerunner you know you were born like a
[1:59:50] forun
[1:59:56] to come and Proclaim his
[2:00:02] name all right so she came like a
[2:00:07] forun and said
[2:00:10] I who told her
[2:00:15] that
[2:00:18] because before she came
[2:00:24] already she came from the king's
[2:00:27] chamber
[2:00:30] and she came
[2:00:32] already
[2:00:34] with a supernatural
[2:00:39] knowledge and are you here all right and
[2:00:45] she said I know Messiah
[2:00:50] coming how do you
[2:00:54] know amen amen is there somebody who can
[2:00:58] tell me how did she
[2:01:01] know that
[2:01:03] Messiah is
[2:01:06] coming it is because she was
[2:01:10] from the
[2:01:14] Messiah you can't serve somebody whom
[2:01:17] you have never met
[2:01:24] amen you came from the
[2:01:27] Messiah in order to
[2:01:30] serve the
[2:01:33] Messiah that's why she
[2:01:35] said I know mesiah how do you
[2:01:41] know amen all right
[2:01:45] amen she couldn't
[2:01:48] know and left she was from that
[2:01:54] Messiah you can only serve
[2:01:58] God
[2:02:00] or the one that you come from
[2:02:04] amen because you know him that's why you
[2:02:08] know how to serve
[2:02:11] him how to live for
[2:02:18] him if you know the Messiah
[2:02:22] then you know for you me to serve the
[2:02:28] Messiah I must
[2:02:32] first be
[2:02:36] cleansed now listen
[2:02:39] here God's word
[2:02:44] promised
[2:02:50] became amen amen all right let me try it
[2:02:55] again God's word
[2:02:58] promised not just God's
[2:03:01] way but the promised
[2:03:05] one you know people they read even go to
[2:03:10] Bible
[2:03:11] school so forth they recite the word but
[2:03:16] here it says God's word
[2:03:25] promise now there's a difference
[2:03:32] between and the word that is
[2:03:36] Promised
[2:03:38] amen the
[2:03:41] word and the word that is sent the
[2:03:45] word and the word that is God
[2:03:54] all the people claiming to be preaching
[2:03:55] the word
[2:04:00] which because the
[2:04:03] word that should be preached by the
[2:04:06] bride of
[2:04:08] Christ page 244 here tells
[2:04:14] me God word
[2:04:19] promised now there just God's word
[2:04:23] but God's
[2:04:29] word there's a difference between the
[2:04:33] word of God and the
[2:04:36] promised word of
[2:04:40] God because the promised
[2:04:43] one has to bring
[2:04:47] forth
[2:04:50] something and for the people to say this
[2:04:54] is that that way that he
[2:04:55] [Music]
[2:04:59] promised now God's word
[2:05:04] promised I quote became
[2:05:11] blood and it
[2:05:13] was

[2:05:57] to
[2:06:02] bleed
[2:06:05] am amen amen amen the word
[2:06:09] promised now not just the
[2:06:12] word the
[2:06:17] word are you are you
[2:06:19] there W I can
[2:06:22] let me hear
[2:06:24] [Music]
[2:06:28] you amen not just the
[2:06:32] way you don't just come to

[2:08:21] but it was in this one
[2:08:25] being the Lord Jesus Christ that was

[2:14:14] redeemed and he has redeemed
[2:14:17] you
[2:14:18] before the foundation of the
[2:14:24] amen amen amen and you were born
[2:14:29] here in order to
[2:14:34] display the
[2:14:40] sunship okay
[2:14:43] amen there is no
[2:14:47] power like the power amen of the
[2:14:55] watch even
[2:14:58] naturally you watch the people coming
[2:15:00] from the same
[2:15:03] family if they are not
[2:15:06] safe deemed they become a
[2:15:12] problem they are a
[2:15:16] CL you see they become a problem
[2:15:22] but if the people are born of
[2:15:25] God Sons and
[2:15:28] Daughters when they meet they speak
[2:15:32] about
[2:15:34] him they are a
[2:15:38] family a family without
[2:15:41] God is
[2:15:48] problem now let's look at this
[2:15:53] this book
[2:15:56] Min P

[2:16:00] blood
[2:16:03] test shows whether you are God's or

[3:04:27] Mercy from
[3:04:30] God now because I knew him I said ah
[3:04:34] well carry on with
[3:04:36] you but I had one
[3:04:39] question that the Lord Jesus
[3:04:42] said I will build my church
[3:04:48] on
[3:04:50] this
[3:04:52] rock and the gates of
[3:04:54] Hades shall never
[3:04:57] Prevail I'm telling you the truth before
[3:05:02] God I said but which church is that
[3:05:07] because I haven't seen
[3:05:10] I I I worship at that
[3:05:13] place at that
[3:05:15] place but these people are still doing
[3:05:18] their
[3:05:20] things our youth
[3:05:24] leader with running around with

[3:05:31] one who stands before
[3:05:35] us amen

[3:06:12] before I decided to stop going to any
[3:06:16] church
[3:06:19] with one
[3:06:20] question the Bible

[3:06:24] I I will build my
[3:06:27] church Upon This Rock and the gates of

[3:06:48] ah that
[3:06:49] one the gates of hell are free to run
[3:06:53] through
[3:06:56] it now while
[3:07:00] pondering asking
[3:07:02] myself then I'm telling you the truth
[3:07:04] before God then I have
[3:07:07] decided to stop going to
[3:07:11] church to sit back and to say to God I'm
[3:07:16] waiting for that
[3:07:18] Church you have promised that the gates
[3:07:22] of her shall never Prevail over

[3:07:42] age it was in the hands of a daughter of
[3:07:46] a pastor

[3:09:26] book I read it and I said this should be
[3:09:30] that
[3:09:31] one but
[3:09:33] where because here I've got a
[3:09:37] booklet
[3:09:40] so after reading that book I went to

[3:13:47] sent
[3:13:50] us
