[48:00] Holy Ghost.
[48:02] [Music]
[48:07] [Applause]
[48:16] Shalom. Shalom. As I greet you all in
[48:19] the precious name of our Lord and Savior
[48:22] Jesus Christ,
[48:27] I was told
[48:31] to obey the voice of an angel.
[48:37] So I'm standing in the gap
[48:42] just to obey the voice of our pastor.
[48:50] Our elders normally say
[48:55] you can't do anything
[48:59] unless it comes by commission.
[49:03] So the pastor will always commission the
[49:05] elders
[49:10] and every time they follow the
[49:12] commission
[49:15] it comes with blessings.
[49:19] We have quite we have he had quite a
[49:22] number of testimonies
[49:25] where the pastor will send the elders to
[49:27] pray for a person
[49:32] and the person that they are praying for
[49:36] will say I see another man
[49:41] and each time when they describe
[49:44] that man
[49:47] we can see that they see the theopan of
[49:50] our past.
[49:55] So we are truly blessed to have a
[49:57] watchman
[50:02] because the word comes to him
[50:05] and he reveals it to the church.
[50:10] So whenever we stand in the gap,
[50:13] we go back to the messages that he
[50:15] preached.
[50:18] And when we listen to those messages,
[50:23] God always honor
[50:28] the man of God
[50:30] and give us a thought.
[50:33] So may the Lord richly bless our pastor.
[50:38] He called this morning
[50:41] and said today he just want to rest.
[50:46] and that he will see us very soon.
[50:51] So we are just going to read a scripture
[50:56] and continue on a thought that the Lord
[50:58] has given unto us.
[51:03] So if you can just sing the song that
[51:05] the pastor love
[51:08] and just say I'll be ready when Jesus
[51:11] comes. I'll be ready
[51:15] while is coming forth
[51:19] just to say a word of prayer.
[51:23] God bless you. Amen.
[51:30] [Music]
[51:38] Be ready.
[51:41] When Jesus
[51:44] come
[51:49] [Music]
[52:02] ready when she
[52:08] Happy
[52:10] [Music]
[52:20] way.
[52:24] [Music]
[52:33] Hallelujah.
[52:35] Let's go ahead and pray.
[52:38] Gracious and eternal father.
[52:41] Indeed, when you come, we will be ready
[52:44] to meet you.
[52:47] We have seen you many a times. We have
[52:50] seen your grace and mercy upon us.
[52:54] Indeed, we do not just take a step in
[52:57] our life without a commission. Amen. We
[53:01] are so generous in this word, Lord God.
[53:04] You make us to bypass our theophony and
[53:07] come in this world. Amen. We will be
[53:10] going back heavenly father to our
[53:12] theophony. But we see them always
[53:15] active. As our precious brother Mercedes
[53:18] just say when the elders pray for
[53:20] someone they see the theophony of our
[53:22] pastor. It's not a myth. It's true
[53:25] indeed.
[53:27] We will keep on appreciating your
[53:29] present amongst us. For Lord God, you
[53:32] brought us here to become more than
[53:35] conquerors. And we cannot be conquerors
[53:38] without a fight. Amen. We fight the
[53:41] devil every day because the war that was
[53:45] in heaven, we fought and we triumph and
[53:48] anything, anytime, anywhere, we shall
[53:52] triumph once more. We love you so much,
[53:56] heavenly father. Bless our pastor and
[53:58] his family. Bless the entire church,
[54:00] heavenly father. As our precious brother
[54:03] Miti is standing behind the pulpes this
[54:05] morning with our precious brother
[54:07] harvest to interpret Lord God. We knew
[54:10] this before the foundation of the world
[54:12] and we prepare the message Lord God. And
[54:15] you prepare our heart once more so that
[54:17] we can absorb. Bless them heavenly
[54:20] father. Put them under your wings. When
[54:22] they talk we should look beyond the
[54:25] flesh.
[54:27] When we look beyond the flesh, we see
[54:29] our theophony and that's where we take
[54:32] from. Hallelujah. Bless each and every
[54:34] individual this morning and all the
[54:36] activities we have seen you when we
[54:38] enter. What a good spirit we have. What
[54:41] a wonderful message we receive, we will
[54:43] receive this morning. Bless everyone,
[54:46] heavenly father. Those that are
[54:47] streaming as well, Lord God, bless them
[54:50] and bless everyone as we put all with
[54:54] the reading of the scripture as well. be
[54:56] the interpreter of it in the name of our
[54:58] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[55:00] Amen.
[55:06] As we turn to Revelation chapter 3 verse
[55:09] 20- 21.
[55:23] It says, "Behold, I stand at the door
[55:25] and knock. If any man hear my voice and
[55:29] open the door, I will come into him and
[55:33] will s with him and he with me. To him
[55:39] that overcomemeth, I will grant to sit
[55:41] with me in my throne. Even as I also
[55:46] overcame, I am set down with my father
[55:49] in his throne.
[56:14] Amen. And also John chapter 10
[56:19] verse 27.
[56:21] John chapter 10 verse 27.
[56:24] My sheep hear my voice
[56:28] and I know them and they follow me.
[56:49] You may take your seats.
[57:00] Uh
[57:02] I'm going to continue with the same
[57:04] title,
[57:08] God condescending to his creation,
[57:14] but I want to take
[57:17] the text
[57:21] from the book of Acts chapter 7
[57:25] where it says,
[57:27] "What house will you build me?"
[57:32] If we can just read this scripture,
[57:36] Acts chapter 7.
[57:39] Acts chapter 7,
[57:42] starting from verse 47.
[57:48] But Solomon
[57:50] But Solomon built him a house.
[57:54] How be it the most high dwelleth not in
[57:58] temples made with hands, as said the
[58:01] prophet.
[58:03] Heaven is my throne
[58:05] and earth is my foottool.
[58:08] What house will you build me? Sayeth the
[58:11] Lord. Or what is the place of my rest?
[58:18] [Music]
[58:24] [Music]
[58:44] So what house
[58:47] will you build me?
[58:52] So that means
[58:54] we have a responsibility
[58:57] to build a house
[59:00] where the Lord will find a place of
[59:03] rest.
[59:08] So it's a question.
[59:10] What house will you build me?
[59:16] Saith the Lord.
[59:18] What is the place of my rest?
[59:23] So that will be our text.
[59:27] So we saw last time
[59:32] that it says the Lord will return
[59:37] again as the son of man.
[59:41] So he will be revealed in our day
[59:46] as the son of man.
[59:48] [Music]
[59:49] So that's what the prophet is teaching
[59:51] us.
[59:54] So I want to
[59:56] read few things from
[59:59] the spoken word hear
[1:00:05] 58 the prophet says
[1:00:08] and this is coming from revelation 3
[1:00:11] verse 20
[1:00:15] for the book says
[1:00:19] behold I stand at the door.
[1:00:24] It is the Lord that is standing at the
[1:00:27] door.
[1:00:29] And he says,
[1:00:31] "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:00:35] If any man hear my voice
[1:00:40] and open the door,
[1:00:43] I will come in."
[1:00:46] We saw last time
[1:00:49] that when God was condescending,
[1:00:52] he was lowering himself.
[1:00:56] And the first thing that we see is the
[1:00:58] fatherhood
[1:01:00] [Music]
[1:01:02] in a pillar of fire.
[1:01:05] Then it was God with us.
[1:01:08] [Music]
[1:01:09] So he lowered himself
[1:01:12] to be with us
[1:01:15] as Emmanuel,
[1:01:17] God with us.
[1:01:19] And they crucified him.
[1:01:22] Then he comes again,
[1:01:25] God in us.
[1:01:28] Now when he comes in us,
[1:01:32] he says he comes to the individuals
[1:01:36] and he says behold
[1:01:38] I stand at the door and knock.
[1:01:42] If any man
[1:01:44] hear my voice.
[1:01:46] So it is the individuals
[1:01:49] that will hear the voice
[1:01:53] and when they hear that voice and open
[1:01:56] the door he comes in.
[1:02:01] Now, it says here,
[1:02:04] "It's a rare thing to hear the voice of
[1:02:06] the Lord
[1:02:09] and to find a person that can say,
[1:02:12] "The Lord spoke to me.
[1:02:17] We should wait on the Lord.
[1:02:21] You see, we do all the talking.
[1:02:25] We don't give him a chance to talk back
[1:02:29] to us.
[1:02:33] If we will pray
[1:02:36] until our soul comes into the presence
[1:02:39] of God
[1:02:43] and then just relax
[1:02:45] and listen to his voice.
[1:02:50] But the prophet says there are so many
[1:02:53] voices
[1:02:55] in the world, so many things to attract
[1:02:59] our attention.
[1:03:04] So the Lord says,
[1:03:09] he that heareth my voice.
[1:03:16] But now we must be careful with the
[1:03:17] voice.
[1:03:20] because it must be the voice of God.
[1:03:27] You know many times people will come
[1:03:31] and said I heard the voice of God
[1:03:36] but when you ask them about that voice
[1:03:37] of God
[1:03:40] it is something else.
[1:03:44] The prophet says
[1:03:47] hear his voice speak back in your heart.
[1:03:55] So it's not a literal voice that will
[1:03:57] come from outside
[1:04:01] but this voice
[1:04:04] comes in your heart
[1:04:08] and the prophet says
[1:04:10] that voice
[1:04:12] is a word expressed.
[1:04:17] So it's not talking about the literal
[1:04:19] voice
[1:04:22] but it is talking about
[1:04:25] a revelation
[1:04:28] a word expressed.
[1:04:32] The prophet speaks about Peter
[1:04:38] and I will read this about Peter.
[1:04:43] But before we do that,
[1:04:45] there are few things that I want to read
[1:04:50] and I believe the Lord will bless us.
[1:04:55] Now I want us to look at some of the
[1:04:58] believers in the Bible.
[1:05:03] Isaiah,
[1:05:04] the prophet says he was changed
[1:05:09] after he heard that voice.
[1:05:12] [Music]
[1:05:13] And he also speaks about Daniel.
[1:05:17] He says when Daniel was in Babylon,
[1:05:20] he understood by the books
[1:05:24] of the prophet
[1:05:27] and he
[1:05:30] wanted to hear the voice of God.
[1:05:35] Yet he had the scriptures,
[1:05:38] but he needed to hear the voice of God.
[1:05:43] and he became desperate about it
[1:05:47] until he heard that voice.
[1:05:56] Amen. Amen.
[1:06:00] So the prophet says
[1:06:03] this voice
[1:06:05] is God in a letter form.
[1:06:11] Amen. This is the entire revelation of
[1:06:14] Jesus Christ.
[1:06:17] So this voice is the entire revelation.
[1:06:24] As the prophet says here,
[1:06:27] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:06:32] Uh paragraph 232. Amen.
[1:06:37] He's talking about Peter.
[1:06:40] It says
[1:06:42] now watch
[1:06:46] when Peter said, "Thou art the Christ,
[1:06:51] the son of the living God."
[1:06:57] The Lord said, "Blessed art thou,
[1:07:00] for flesh and blood never revealed this
[1:07:03] to you.
[1:07:06] You never learned it from school,
[1:07:10] but my father
[1:07:12] which is in heaven has revealed it to
[1:07:15] you.
[1:07:17] So Peter heard the voice
[1:07:21] but to him
[1:07:23] the Lord says it came by revelation.
[1:07:28] Notice what he said to him.
[1:07:32] That's Peter, the rock,
[1:07:36] the predestinated seat of God
[1:07:40] that had received this light
[1:07:44] and was given the keys to the kingdom
[1:07:48] upon this rock
[1:07:51] of revelation
[1:07:53] of who Jesus Christ is.
[1:07:58] You see that voice is the revelation
[1:08:02] of who Jesus Christ is.
[1:08:06] So once it is revealed to you
[1:08:11] who he is
[1:08:13] then you have heard the voice
[1:08:19] and it gives you power. It says the
[1:08:22] gates of hell will never shake you.
[1:08:27] It will never prevail against you.
[1:08:30] a revelation of who Jesus Christ is.
[1:08:36] Amen. Amen.
[1:08:38] Now it also says
[1:08:43] and this
[1:08:46] is what I like
[1:08:50] because the pastor kept repeating this
[1:08:55] and it has blessed me
[1:08:58] because it says
[1:09:01] it is based upon the revelation
[1:09:05] who Jesus Christ is.
[1:09:10] Now the prophet says
[1:09:13] John the revelator
[1:09:17] was filled
[1:09:19] was filled full of quickening power
[1:09:24] that stood up and seen the end from the
[1:09:26] beginning.
[1:09:30] Isaiah was full of the quickening power
[1:09:34] and stood up and seen the millennia.
[1:09:40] Now the prophet also says
[1:09:44] look what we have seen in this day.
[1:09:51] The quickening power has come to us
[1:09:56] to open the seven seats.
[1:10:00] So today the prophet says when you want
[1:10:03] to know who he is,
[1:10:06] he says he is the one who opened those.
[1:10:11] So the voice of God today is the
[1:10:15] revelation of who he is
[1:10:19] and today he is those sins.
[1:10:23] The prophet says Christ is the sins that
[1:10:26] was over.
[1:10:29] So that voice of God he says he who hear
[1:10:33] my voice
[1:10:36] and that voice comes by revelation
[1:10:39] of who he is
[1:10:43] and today he is those things that
[1:10:49] the pastor is always talking about the
[1:10:51] revelation of the service
[1:10:55] because today that voice is the
[1:10:59] revelation of who
[1:11:02] and that is Christ is the seals that was
[1:11:06] open.
[1:11:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:11:13] God bless you.
[1:11:16] Now it says here
[1:11:22] Christ in you
[1:11:25] makes you the center of life of the
[1:11:27] revelation.
[1:11:31] So that revelation
[1:11:35] of who he is
[1:11:38] the prophet says
[1:11:42] it builds another body in you.
[1:11:48] Hallelujah. Amen. Now
[1:11:52] the prophet says
[1:11:55] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:11:57] personally to you
[1:12:01] is what he calls the new birth.
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:07] They ask him what is the new birth.
[1:12:11] Well, brother Brandham, what is the new
[1:12:12] birth?
[1:12:14] And he says it is the revelation
[1:12:17] of Jesus Christ, personally
[1:12:21] to you.
[1:12:24] So it's not just a revelation
[1:12:28] but it is personal.
[1:12:32] It is an individual affair.
[1:12:37] And it says from this new birth
[1:12:42] it builds another person
[1:12:46] in this image that you are.
[1:12:54] It says here cood
[1:12:58] paragraph 248. Paragraph 248.
[1:13:02] This body is subject to death
[1:13:06] and it will die.
[1:13:09] But the inside part of you
[1:13:12] down in here
[1:13:15] inside
[1:13:17] that is the person that cannot die.
[1:13:21] That's the person that the new life
[1:13:23] starts from.
[1:13:25] Remember our text says,
[1:13:28] "What house will you build me?"
[1:13:33] It says, "What house will you
[1:13:37] build me?"
[1:13:39] But it is actually the Lord
[1:13:41] building the house in you
[1:13:44] so that he can come and dwell.
[1:13:47] But because you are part of his
[1:13:49] attribute
[1:13:52] back in the beginning, he said let us
[1:13:58] let us. But when it comes to an
[1:14:01] individual
[1:14:03] says what house will you
[1:14:08] because it's a personal revelation.
[1:14:14] Now that personal revelation,
[1:14:16] the prophet says, it starts inside of
[1:14:21] you
[1:14:25] from this new birth
[1:14:28] and it builds another person
[1:14:32] in the image of this person that you are
[1:14:39] that the Lord wants to dwell in.
[1:14:44] He build it from the revelation of who
[1:14:47] he is.
[1:14:50] So once you receive that revelation,
[1:14:54] then it says it builds another person
[1:14:58] in the image of this person that you
[1:15:00] are.
[1:15:03] the word that's in you
[1:15:06] materialize
[1:15:08] around that.
[1:15:13] So he's building another house,
[1:15:16] a house that he can come and
[1:15:20] when we read the masterpiece
[1:15:22] masterpiece, it says
[1:15:25] let let
[1:15:29] the Lord willing, let us read
[1:15:30] masterpiece.
[1:15:33] masterpiece. If I can find it. Ah, there
[1:15:36] we are. Thanks, my brother. Amen.
[1:15:39] It says,
[1:15:42] "But here the master builder."
[1:15:47] You see, the one that built that house
[1:15:50] is the Lord himself.
[1:15:52] He says, "I stand at the door and knock.
[1:15:56] He that heareth my voice,
[1:15:59] all that you have to do
[1:16:01] is to stand still
[1:16:07] and let him
[1:16:09] reveal himself
[1:16:11] personally to you.
[1:16:14] And from that new birth,
[1:16:16] the master builder
[1:16:20] re gives is a the new birth is a gift
[1:16:25] from God. Amen.
[1:16:28] It's a gift from God. That's why the
[1:16:31] prophet calls him the master builder.
[1:16:35] When when that house
[1:16:38] is now perfected,
[1:16:41] he steps inside.
[1:16:44] Then it is God in us.
[1:16:48] But first, he must build the house.
[1:16:53] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:58] God bless you.
[1:17:01] The prophet says, "When you read the
[1:17:03] spoken word to the angel of the Lord,
[1:17:08] the new birth is an experience,
[1:17:11] it is a gift of God.
[1:17:14] It's a seal of your faith.
[1:17:19] When his spirit bears record with your
[1:17:22] spirit,
[1:17:26] in an experience of the new birth.
[1:17:31] And the prophet says
[1:17:34] every birth
[1:17:37] is a mess.
[1:17:40] And he said there's three things that
[1:17:42] come from his body
[1:17:47] that makes up the new birth. Amen.
[1:17:50] Water,
[1:17:52] blood, and the spirit.
[1:17:55] That's why it says
[1:17:59] when he was talking to Nicodemus,
[1:18:02] how can a man be born again
[1:18:05] and he said, "Except a man be born of
[1:18:08] wood
[1:18:10] and the spirit, he cannot see the
[1:18:13] kingdom."
[1:18:15] So for you to receive this new birth,
[1:18:19] We start from the water.
[1:18:22] So that's why we have to be baptized in
[1:18:24] the name of the Lord.
[1:18:28] Amen.
[1:18:30] And the prophet says
[1:18:32] there's a spoken word
[1:18:36] impersonation of Christianity.
[1:18:41] And the prophet says something wonderful
[1:18:43] here
[1:18:45] that
[1:18:48] what happens after you are baptized.
[1:18:53] It says God actually
[1:18:57] uh take the old stony heart out
[1:19:03] and put a new fleshy heart.
[1:19:09] Scientifically we can't explain.
[1:19:14] And he says notice the order.
[1:19:18] First I will take away the old stony
[1:19:21] heart.
[1:19:23] With that stony heart you can't receive
[1:19:26] nothing.
[1:19:29] Then he said I'll give you a new spirit.
[1:19:33] Then the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:36] And he says
[1:19:40] this is where the mistake has been made.
[1:19:45] Many people rather come to the altar to
[1:19:47] pray
[1:19:50] and they get down there to pray and
[1:19:52] praying.
[1:19:54] They get to feeling a little bit better.
[1:19:57] They might get up and go up and jump
[1:20:01] around a little while
[1:20:03] and after a while you find they just
[1:20:05] bounce.
[1:20:09] They never received the Holy Spirit.
[1:20:16] So they just received
[1:20:18] the new spirit
[1:20:21] because the Lord said, "I'll give you a
[1:20:23] new spirit."
[1:20:27] Why the spirit? Amen.
[1:20:30] Why the spirit you had not even get
[1:20:33] along with yourself?
[1:20:38] So how so how are you going to get along
[1:20:41] with God?
[1:20:44] That means with your old spirit
[1:20:47] you yourself could not get along with
[1:20:49] yourself.
[1:20:52] So you can't even get along with
[1:20:55] cuz you can't get along with yourself.
[1:20:59] So God had to give you a new heart.
[1:21:03] Not a patched up one,
[1:21:07] but a new heart.
[1:21:10] Amen. Amen. Amen. He said, "I'll give
[1:21:14] you a new spirit."
[1:21:17] That's a new desire
[1:21:20] so that you can quit smoking.
[1:21:23] you can have a desire to read the
[1:21:24] scriptures.
[1:21:28] Then after that
[1:21:31] he will put his spirit.
[1:21:36] Amen. Amen.
[1:21:38] So the prophet says here
[1:21:41] three things come from his body that
[1:21:43] makes up the new birth.
[1:21:48] Blood and spirit. And the prophet says
[1:21:52] when you read the spoken word why I'm
[1:21:54] praying for the sick
[1:21:58] when I got the new birth
[1:22:03] I got the new blood.
[1:22:07] So he gives you a new heart,
[1:22:10] new spirit,
[1:22:12] new heart,
[1:22:14] new blood.
[1:22:17] Hallelujah. So he had taken away the old
[1:22:21] and gave you the new.
[1:22:26] God
[1:22:27] brings the new birth into you
[1:22:32] and gives you a part of himself.
[1:22:37] See the new birth
[1:22:40] gives you part of himself.
[1:22:45] Amen. When the new birth is come,
[1:22:49] you are changed.
[1:22:52] And that same new birth,
[1:22:55] he builds another body in you.
[1:22:59] When it is perfected,
[1:23:02] he steps inside.
[1:23:06] When you believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:23:08] Christ,
[1:23:10] you then have the new birth.
[1:23:13] You receive a new thought,
[1:23:16] a new life.
[1:23:18] But that is not the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:20] Ghost.
[1:23:22] You see the new birth is a revelation of
[1:23:26] Jesus Christ personally.
[1:23:31] This only comes to the predestination
[1:23:35] because the prophet we read it last time
[1:23:38] that we can receive the new we can
[1:23:40] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:44] and still go to hell.
[1:23:48] But with a new birth
[1:23:51] is a personal revelation
[1:23:54] of who he is.
[1:23:57] And the prophet says here
[1:24:01] you have got the new birth when you
[1:24:03] believe.
[1:24:06] That means you've got eternal life.
[1:24:11] The gift of God.
[1:24:13] by his sovereign grace,
[1:24:16] the gift that God is giving to you.
[1:24:22] Hallelujah. Amen. But the baptism of the
[1:24:25] Holy Spirit
[1:24:27] puts you into the body of Christ
[1:24:32] subject to his services.
[1:24:36] [Music]
[1:24:38] Amen. The baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:42] is a different act from the new birth.
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:24:47] One is a birth. One is a baptism.
[1:24:51] One brings you eternal life.
[1:24:56] That's question and answers on Hebrews
[1:24:58] part two. Amen. Preached in 1957. Amen.
[1:25:03] The new birth
[1:25:06] is different from the baptism of the
[1:25:08] Holy Ghost.
[1:25:11] One is a birth. One is a baptism.
[1:25:15] The new birth
[1:25:17] brings you eternal life.
[1:25:21] The Holy Ghost
[1:25:24] gives you power.
[1:25:28] So that means the other one receives the
[1:25:31] the revelation personal revelation of
[1:25:34] who the Lord is
[1:25:39] which gives him
[1:25:41] eternal life.
[1:25:44] You see, when you receive the new birth,
[1:25:47] it proves to you that you were part of
[1:25:50] his attribute
[1:25:54] and you start to build another.
[1:25:58] And God gives you the Holy Ghost,
[1:26:02] power,
[1:26:04] but the other one can receive the Holy
[1:26:05] Ghost,
[1:26:07] which gives him power, but it's not
[1:26:09] predestined.
[1:26:14] That's why the prophet says these two
[1:26:16] are different.
[1:26:19] Amen. Amen. Let's finish with this.
[1:26:26] The natural birth.
[1:26:35] Let me read
[1:26:39] his first birth brings him a natural man
[1:26:42] on earth. His
[1:26:47] second birth
[1:26:49] brings him a spiritual man of heaven.
[1:26:56] You see the new birth
[1:26:58] brings
[1:27:00] your attribute.
[1:27:03] The part that you bypass
[1:27:07] start to build in you
[1:27:10] through the new birth. Amen.
[1:27:14] It changes him.
[1:27:17] Amen. Amen.
[1:27:20] God bless you.
[1:27:23] Aren't you glad that the pastor has
[1:27:25] taught us this
[1:27:29] [Applause]
[1:27:30] there was a there's a testimony of a
[1:27:32] brother.
[1:27:35] Now this brother says
[1:27:39] the church in Modi
[1:27:42] is blessed
[1:27:44] because
[1:27:46] the pastor
[1:27:48] prepared them
[1:27:50] for the rapture.
[1:27:55] Amen.
[1:27:57] Amen. So we are blessed
[1:28:00] because our pastor
[1:28:02] is preparing us
[1:28:05] for the rapture.
[1:28:10] You know, we had an opportunity to have
[1:28:12] a fellowship with the el with the
[1:28:14] pastor.
[1:28:17] So the elders had an opportunity
[1:28:21] to fellowship with the pastor
[1:28:25] and he was telling us about the east
[1:28:27] gate.
[1:28:31] So there's a mystery about the east gate
[1:28:36] because even the Jews
[1:28:38] they watching the east gate
[1:28:41] because they said when he came for the
[1:28:43] first time he came through the east
[1:28:45] gate.
[1:28:48] So now he's coming back and they
[1:28:51] watching the east gate
[1:28:53] and the pastor says they are watching it
[1:28:57] and it's vibrating.
[1:28:59] It's shaking. Amen. So they saying he
[1:29:02] can come at any
[1:29:04] [Music]
[1:29:10] watchman.
[1:29:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:17] So the prophet says
[1:29:19] this new birth
[1:29:22] it's Christ himself.
[1:29:25] Amen. is the revelation.
[1:29:28] God has revealed to you
[1:29:31] a great mystery and that's a new birth.
[1:29:36] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:38] I want us to read a scripture here. John
[1:29:41] chapter 5
[1:29:45] verse 25.
[1:29:54] You know this scripture we normally read
[1:29:55] it uh when we go to funerals.
[1:30:05] But the scripture is eternal
[1:30:09] says verily verily I say unto you
[1:30:14] the hour is coming.
[1:30:19] Amen. Amen. Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:30:22] you,
[1:30:24] the hour is coming,
[1:30:27] and now is
[1:30:30] when the dead
[1:30:33] shall hear the voice of the son of God,
[1:30:38] and they that hear shall live.
[1:30:42] Amen.
[1:30:44] So I was looking at this scripture.
[1:30:48] The dead
[1:30:50] shall hear the voice of the son of God.
[1:30:55] Now these are not the dead from the
[1:30:57] grave.
[1:31:00] Because the Bible says we are dead while
[1:31:02] we are alive.
[1:31:06] Now it says, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:31:08] you,
[1:31:09] the hour is coming, and now is."
[1:31:14] When you go to verse 28,
[1:31:17] verse 28, it says, "Marvel not at this,
[1:31:21] for the hour is coming in which all that
[1:31:25] are in the graves shall hear his voice."
[1:31:28] Amen. It talks about the second
[1:31:30] resurrection.
[1:31:33] So these are in the graves.
[1:31:37] So you must not wait until you in the
[1:31:39] grave to hear it.
[1:31:44] You must because he says the the hour is
[1:31:46] coming
[1:31:48] and now is
[1:31:51] when the dead shall hear the voice of
[1:31:54] the son of God.
[1:31:57] And it comes again and says, "Verily,
[1:32:00] verily, I say unto you,
[1:32:04] uh, chapter 8 verse 51, chapter 8, verse
[1:32:08] 51. Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a
[1:32:12] man keep my saying,
[1:32:18] he shall never see death."
[1:32:21] Amen. So you can only keep his saying
[1:32:24] while you are still alive.
[1:32:28] So when you keep his saying,
[1:32:31] it means his word has a place in you.
[1:32:36] And when the word of God has a place in
[1:32:38] you,
[1:32:40] it says
[1:32:42] they that
[1:32:48] it says, "And when the dead shall hear
[1:32:51] the voice of the son of God,
[1:32:56] You see during the seven church ages,
[1:33:01] it is son of God. Son of God.
[1:33:05] And during the seven church age,
[1:33:08] it says God working through men.
[1:33:14] But then it says he that overcometh.
[1:33:18] You see the the pastor says the bride
[1:33:22] is made of the overcomer.
[1:33:26] So he that overcometh.
[1:33:29] Now the overcomers are the bride.
[1:33:33] So those are the people that were dead.
[1:33:37] Then they heard the voice and the Bible
[1:33:40] says they that hear that voice
[1:33:44] shall live.
[1:33:46] So when you receive that revelation of
[1:33:53] then you shall live.
[1:33:55] Amen. Amen. I want to read this and we
[1:33:59] are preparing to close.
[1:34:05] It is the rising of the sun
[1:34:09] paragraph
[1:34:11] 309.
[1:34:13] Amen.
[1:34:20] It says
[1:34:26] paragraph 310
[1:34:28] paragraph 310 the quickening power.
[1:34:33] Let us see his coming.
[1:34:37] Amen. You see the reason why he had to
[1:34:40] give us the Holy Ghost
[1:34:43] so that we can see his coming.
[1:34:48] The quickening power
[1:34:51] snatched us from death.
[1:34:58] Snatched us
[1:35:00] to life.
[1:35:02] That is the quickening power. So we have
[1:35:05] been snatched
[1:35:08] from death to life.
[1:35:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:35:16] I'm preparing to close.
[1:35:21] See, I'm closing my books.
[1:35:26] Hallelujah. Amen. So, I'm just going to
[1:35:29] read the last thing.
[1:35:32] The prophet talks about the
[1:35:37] the three-fold purpose
[1:35:43] and in that three-fold purpose.
[1:35:47] One of them is the second one.
[1:35:50] He talks about the preeeminence.
[1:35:55] Amen. Uh paragraph 141. Paragraph 141
[1:36:00] and paragraph 154. The 154 the prophet
[1:36:05] speaks of
[1:36:07] the first
[1:36:11] he talk about the threefold
[1:36:14] purpose.
[1:36:17] He said the first thing God wanted to
[1:36:19] reveal himself.
[1:36:24] Amen. That was the first thing
[1:36:27] to express himself completely
[1:36:34] and that was God in Christ.
[1:36:37] Amen. Secondly, to have the preeeminence
[1:36:42] in his church
[1:36:44] which is his body.
[1:36:47] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:50] That's what the prophet says here.
[1:36:54] Secondly to have preeeminence in his
[1:36:56] body of believers
[1:37:00] that is
[1:37:02] that he might live in people.
[1:37:06] So he wanted to have a preeeminence
[1:37:11] God in us.
[1:37:14] That's why the scripture says
[1:37:17] Christ the hope of glory.
[1:37:21] So the mystery
[1:37:23] is God in us
[1:37:26] and that is the revelation
[1:37:28] of the son of man.
[1:37:32] God
[1:37:34] working in a man.
[1:37:38] May the Lord richly bless you.
[1:37:41] Amen.
[1:37:47] as we stand on our feet
[1:37:52] and ask our elder
[1:37:57] just to say a word of prayer.
[1:38:01] May the Lord richly bless you.
[1:38:04] Amen.
[1:38:13] Let us bow our heads and pray. Let us
[1:38:17] all rise.
[1:38:24] Heavenly Father,
[1:38:28] it is always
[1:38:30] our life. Lord
[1:38:33] to hear your voice
[1:38:35] at all times.
[1:38:40] When we left our homes,
[1:38:43] we come with an intention, Lord
[1:38:45] Almighty,
[1:38:47] to hear thee speaking unto us. And when
[1:38:51] we arrived here, Lord, we subjected
[1:38:54] ourselves,
[1:38:56] unto whoever will be standing behind the
[1:38:59] pullpit,
[1:39:01] knowing, Lord, that that's where the
[1:39:02] anointing is.
[1:39:05] Our brother was standing here behind the
[1:39:07] pullpit. Yes, we had some golden nuggets
[1:39:11] Lord Almighty
[1:39:13] which father comes from thee.
[1:39:16] When we pray, we said, "Father,
[1:39:19] it is the day that you have chosen." And
[1:39:23] when you've chosen this day, you have
[1:39:25] chosen a speaker for us. We will never
[1:39:29] come here
[1:39:31] and go back in vain. Lord Almighty. We
[1:39:35] like to thank you, Father, for the mercy
[1:39:37] that you have done unto us. Amen. Many
[1:39:40] people go to the services
[1:39:43] empty and they will come back empty Lord
[1:39:48] because the pullpit is empty.
[1:39:51] But with us gracious heavenly father, we
[1:39:54] know all times that you descend. Amen.
[1:39:57] Regardless of who is behind the pullpit,
[1:40:00] Lord, but you always descend, Lord
[1:40:03] Almighty. We have received from thee,
[1:40:06] Lord Almighty. And we have Lord Almighty
[1:40:10] encouraged and we are anointed and Lord
[1:40:14] Almighty the power has been given unto
[1:40:18] us through these words that you spoke
[1:40:20] through our brother Meterte here Lord.
[1:40:23] Thank you father. Let's everybody Lord
[1:40:26] almighty will go back gracious Lord
[1:40:29] Almighty having the knowledge and
[1:40:32] understanding of how you communicate
[1:40:35] with us and how you descend Lord
[1:40:38] Almighty unto us and how Lord Almighty
[1:40:42] you quicken us. We have learned that
[1:40:45] Lord Almighty through your word that was
[1:40:47] preached by our your servant here Lord.
[1:40:51] Thank you Father. Bless each and
[1:40:53] everyone Lord that he of your voice
[1:40:56] because you said he that heareth my
[1:40:58] voice and we believe that we have heard
[1:41:01] your voice Lord. Thank you Lord
[1:41:04] Almighty. Bless him abundantly Lord
[1:41:06] Almighty. May he come again Lord to come
[1:41:09] and uplift us Lord Almighty. Thank you
[1:41:12] father. We pray for those Lord Almighty
[1:41:16] that have heard the word that they
[1:41:18] should keep it Lord and they should the
[1:41:21] word should develop itself unto them
[1:41:23] Lord. Thank you father in the name of
[1:41:26] our Lord Jesus Christ we like to thank
[1:41:28] you Lord. Amen and amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:35] God bless you and all thanks.
[1:41:43] Hallelujah.
[1:41:50] We just want to thank the Lord
[1:41:57] and we give God all the glory
[1:42:01] for our pastor to use our deacon.
[1:42:06] He went just straight to the point
[1:42:10] and we like to thank the Lord.
[1:42:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:42:16] The gate are starting to shake.
[1:42:20] [Applause]
[1:42:22] Hallelujah. Amen. I'm not sure whether
[1:42:26] the brother is ready for baptism. Is he
[1:42:29] here?

[1:58:52] them, "Repent and be baptized, every one
[1:58:54] of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[1:58:57] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[1:58:59] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
