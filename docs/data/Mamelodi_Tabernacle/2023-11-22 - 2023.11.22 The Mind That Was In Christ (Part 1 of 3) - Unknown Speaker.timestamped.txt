[5:58] and
[6:08] in English it say let this mind be in
[6:11] you which was also in Christ
[6:19] [Applause]
[6:21] [Music]
[6:26] Jesus
[6:28] bless
[6:35] the mind that was in
[6:43] Christ mind in
[6:49] [Applause]
[6:51] stages the prophet says started being an
[6:58] attribute
[7:00] [Applause]
[7:02] then it was the attribute became a
[7:09] [Applause]
[7:12] word became a
[7:15] [Applause]
[7:23] man the prophet says to God wanted to
[7:28] Fellowship
[7:34] [Applause]
[7:37] but now he realized that the only thing
[7:41] he could fellowship with was his
[7:52] mind but then he had to bring that mind
[7:56] into some beings and
[8:09] [Music]
[8:12] with his
[8:20] mind
[8:22] so what what we worship God today is the
[8:27] mind of God made
[8:36] [Applause]
[8:38] as as in the Bible we read that the Lord
[8:43] Jesus said the true
[8:47] [Applause]
[8:53] [Applause]
[8:57] worship now brother here I will read
[9:01] this part from Christ is the Myster of
[9:03] go Christ is revealed in
[9:14] [Applause]
[9:16] his now he says the body
[9:21] has hands starting from the feet to the
[9:28] eye
[9:31] [Applause]
[9:37] and he Likens that to the seven Church
[9:41] [Applause]
[9:46] ages then he says the last the next
[9:50] thing is the head which is the
[9:54] [Applause]
[9:58] inell
[10:02] now he says we are in the head
[10:06] [Applause]
[10:10] time mind operates from the
[10:18] head now he says this is the
[10:22] intelligence
[10:28] which
[10:30] who controls the whole
[10:36] body because he says beyond the
[10:43] eye there is no
[10:46] [Applause]
[10:56] mov so it sends you to
[10:59] the seven
[11:01] [Applause]
[11:04] seal that there is no motion there is no
[11:08] moving
[11:11] [Applause]
[11:18] motion so when the seven seal was open
[11:22] all
[11:27] was
[11:30] now there it needs
[11:34] [Applause]
[11:38] intence because it's something that
[11:40] people cannot
[11:45] see now it
[11:51] [Applause]
[11:53] takh to
[11:56] speak when all is silent
[12:02] [Applause]
[12:05] says in the book
[12:08] [Applause]
[12:10] [Music]
[12:15] [Applause]
[12:16] of of God lays beneath the seven
[12:22] [Applause]
[12:27] SE
[12:34] now because heaven
[12:46] [Music]
[12:51] is now from the head to the
[12:57] heart
[12:58] [Applause]
[13:00] now the head is above
[13:06] the and the Heart ISE the
[13:09] [Applause]
[13:13] head now says theer
[13:16] [Applause]
[13:19] of
[13:21] is
[13:25] [Applause]
[13:27] the now we realize the heart is in the
[13:37] body now the bride is the body of
[13:42] [Applause]
[13:47] Christ the heart is in the
[13:50] [Applause]
[13:55] body the mystery is from the mind of God
[14:06] their so now if I
[14:14] read um this
[14:20] mind that was in
[14:24] Christ we will read a bit here about it
[14:29] [Applause]
[14:36] the mind that was in
[14:41] Christ now it say that mind be
[14:50] you he says no longer in
[14:57] mind
[15:10] now we open the
[15:13] [Applause]
[15:16] books we I have the book here Souls that
[15:19] are in
[15:27] prison
[15:32] um it
[15:36] [Music]
[15:39] says now says the soul of men is not the
[15:44] body
[15:48] [Applause]
[15:50] of the body has
[15:57] five of has nothing to
[16:07] with
[16:09] something from the
[16:11] [Applause]
[16:18] body just as the seven is something from
[16:27] church
[16:28] [Applause]
[16:31] so now as we have the seven churches and
[16:33] the Seven
[16:37] [Applause]
[16:39] SE we have a man the man and the
[16:49] Soul
[16:52] [Music]
[16:57] we so each of these two
[17:07] [Applause]
[17:07] [Music]
[17:18] [Music]
[17:23] people that's why we have the ministry
[17:25] of theeven
[17:27] chur
[17:35] [Applause]
[17:38] one is is Earthly the other one is
[17:43] [Music]
[17:51] spiritual
[17:57] body the
[18:00] soul that's the nature of the
[18:06] [Applause]
[18:08] spirit
[18:27] body each of these persons
[18:30] has his own
[18:33] [Applause]
[18:37] nature now the prophet
[18:42] says when the B says
[18:48] [Applause]
[18:51] we are
[18:57] INR
[18:58] [Applause]
[19:01] is not
[19:03] [Applause]
[19:06] your it wasn't the that
[19:09] died it wasn't the spirit that
[19:15] died it was the nature of of your
[19:24] spirit it's the nature of your
[19:36] because the prophet
[19:41] says when a
[19:51] mother he says uh it is the she delivers
[19:57] a body
[19:58] [Applause]
[20:02] and when she delivers a body there's a
[20:04] spirit waiting for that
[20:16] body while the child the wom of the
[20:19] mother it's not
[20:27] living they hear the
[20:35] movements theing
[20:43] the not come into the
[20:49] body the body is in
[20:52] [Applause]
[20:55] the life is breing outside
[21:01] as soon as the body is
[21:06] delivered then he says then that little
[21:10] Spirit comes
[21:13] [Applause]
[21:23] in and there was a spirit that
[21:44] stes of you have three
[21:50] stages the first the body is
[21:55] delivered secondly comes into
[22:03] the and the prophet says that is the
[22:06] Angel of the that is theel of
[22:15] the and when this little angel comes
[22:19] into the
[22:20] body when this little angel or this
[22:23] Spirit comes into the
[22:26] body
[22:36] but he
[22:37] says now this is a child born born
[22:46] on but later the word of God comes to
[22:50] this
[22:52] [Applause]
[22:55] child he the way he hears the of
[23:02] God and he says now he must
[23:12] make that's where predestination comes
[23:20] in he says when the
[23:24] child makes this
[23:26] choice
[23:30] [Music]
[23:31] [Applause]
[23:36] ites then when this
[23:42] happens then you see the angel of the
[23:45] Lord now comes
[23:47] [Applause]
[23:53] in now the first Angel of the
[23:56] earth came
[24:04] the then
[24:12] [Applause]
[24:21] you he
[24:24] says now when you make a decision
[24:42] another this is the Angel of the
[24:49] Lord for First
[24:56] Corinthians say is
[25:01] the the first man is of the
[25:05] [Applause]
[25:11] [Music]
[25:13] earth is the Lord From
[25:21] Heaven says this shows you
[25:26] predestination
[25:32] because he says now this body that
[25:36] comes it's not
[25:41] a that's
[25:46] Eternal the first one is not
[25:52] [Applause]
[25:56] etal
[26:09] and
[26:17] ET now that's why as we
[26:26] on
[26:33] [Applause]
[26:36] it was the nature of your spirit that
[26:40] [Applause]
[26:43] di says we
[26:51] in he says and and uh that is the soul
[26:56] the nature of your spirit the soul
[27:02] [Applause]
[27:10] di but if you are born
[27:16] again then your the nature of your
[27:20] spirit is
[27:25] God that's are born
[27:32] again you receive
[27:45] [Applause]
[27:56] another
[27:58] it the new
[28:04] s that
[28:07] means as a
[28:10] Christian you receive a
[28:18] new the first
[28:22] one
[28:24] [Applause]
[28:26] the said
[28:28] [Applause]
[28:30] when there was no one to K the ground
[28:37] [Applause]
[28:54] Genesis now he could not the ground
[29:17] he could not find somebody to k a
[29:24] ground the only man he had was
[29:33] [Applause]
[29:35] so as the prophet T that he had to bring
[29:38] Adam down into a body of
[29:45] [Applause]
[29:51] dust amen amen because the garden is all
[29:56] the ground
[30:03] now to
[30:08] [Applause]
[30:12] theard made of the
[30:20] ground man could also not the
[30:26] ground
[30:28] until God into that man the pr of
[30:38] life and that's why the prophet says
[30:41] that's when he brought the into the
[30:52] body then he became a living soul
[31:05] [Applause]
[31:11] that's
[31:12] why said to
[31:17] him thou shall not eat from that
[31:24] tree because the soul is all the
[31:32] as God not say to a
[31:41] [Applause]
[31:43] heaven the
[31:46] nature he gave that Spirit the Earthly
[31:56] nature
[31:57] that and said shall notat from this
[32:02] [Applause]
[32:06] Tre because he gave
[32:11] him
[32:16] nature amen that's why the day you
[32:20] receive the
[32:26] heaven
[32:27] you start to eat from the Tree of
[32:34] Life Now The Prophet
[32:38] continues the first was made
[32:50] a because the Bible says Adam was first
[32:54] formed and the woman after
[33:01] [Applause]
[33:07] so the
[33:23] first until he was put in the garden
[33:33] and the
[33:37] prophet after he his
[33:44] [Applause]
[33:53] own after he made in His image
[34:07] because the
[34:10] woman appeared only in
[34:14] [Applause]
[34:16] the
[34:24] all God put
[34:35] if we read the
[34:39] Bible you realize
[34:40] [Music]
[34:43] that let me just read a
[34:48] [Applause]
[34:49] bit Book of
[34:54] Genesis we will read chapter

[35:07] now4 it says these are the generations
[35:10] of the
[35:14] [Applause]
[35:15] [Music]
[35:20] heavens when they were created in the
[35:22] day that the Lord God made the earth and
[35:25] the heaven
[35:27] [Applause]
[35:32] and every of the field before it was in

[36:17] ground so God kept things to
[36:24] himself a me to
[36:39] [Applause]
[36:42] it say there was no man to open
[36:47] [Applause]
[36:50] the but it shows you that God will
[36:53] always look for a man as
[37:05] when there was no to the
[37:11] ground do something
[37:17] about until he find that
[37:25] man he he took that man in His
[37:34] image into the
[37:36] [Applause]
[37:43] body am
