Father, we just want to thank you and running short of words to thank you. There's so much that you are doing for us. So much that you are doing for your bride this morning. Father, we just want to thank you for such a wonderful time in your presence. As father, the Bible says there was a tabernacle that was within the house and father it has to go out of the house and all people they need to follow that tabernacle. Baba, there's a tabernacle which is here. Lord all of us we came out from our different houses to come and gathered out ourselves here because we know that father we are going to meet our God.

He's always with the bride. In these times, difficult times, gracious heavenly father, you have said Lord that you will show yourself when the spirit of the enemy father comes. The Bible says you will lift up the standard because the God that we serve is a God who's looking after her wife which is the bride. We just want to command the devil that all your techniques, &gt;&gt; the God that we serve, he knows them &gt;&gt; and they will never work &gt;&gt; because the God that we serve is always watching over the bride in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We stand against you. We stand against your plans.

Shalom streaming from Zambia. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's say God bless our brother Alisha Kubisa. &gt;&gt; God bless our brother Alicia. &gt;&gt; We love you our brother. God bless you so much for sending such a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We also have our elders from the US. We just want to say God bless our elder Raid Gapin. &gt;&gt; God bless our elder Raid Gerson. And God bless our elder Larry Mims. &gt;&gt; And God bless our elder Larry Mims. &gt;&gt; I know that our Elder Red, he sent some um greetings last week. Amen. So we love them a lot. Hallelujah. So as we continue, we've got our elder and the and their family and the family. They are saying that they would like to thank the Lord Jesus Christ in the ministry of the power of the thirdpool and our under the pastor Israel and the bride. So maybe to summarize this, our elder says to me they want to thank the Lord because there is a sister probably who park her car in their yard. So as she was driving the car just along the gate then the son of Baba Rato he came so that he can assist the sister to park the car in the right spot. So he had a key in his hand while he was trying to drive the car. Then there were thieves who were following the car. Probably they wanted to take that car. So they were struggling with the sun until they shot I think he was talking about nine bullets. But we like to thank the Lord that he was short. The son he was short but he is alive. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So this is also a reminder brethren about our attire. We once announced about it. But it seems something is also happening. So this is just to remind our brethren that please brethren avoid wearing teis in the tabernacle of the Lord. Probably some of you or some of us we were those days when we are driving maybe you forget to change and take the right ones but probably you need to put the alarm maybe to remind you. Amen. Amen. So please let's avoid that. Brethren, we also want also to say those skinny jeans [Music] and and the skinny trousers. Oh, please brothers because some of our brothers they take them to Taylor so that they can just put them to be but please don't come with those in the tabernacle. Are you okay? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And also to our sisters, &gt;&gt; please do not wear those short sleeves shirts or dresses or high heels. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We know we need to follow our church order, brother. We are in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we all happy? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a request here requested &gt;&gt; that we should announce this family is organizing a party for their father. Now this is is really a surprise to the father. But we'll bring it as it is because they know that his is live streaming. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So this party is organized by the by the children for their father and the date is going to be on the 28th of February 28th February 2026. 2026. So they want to make a big party where they want to slaughter a cow. So now brethren are also invited on this party. So God willing if we are still here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is the party from the family. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So brethren, we are also requesting here &gt;&gt; also. This is a reminder that um the announcement we I remember we set the time of 9:30 that after 9:30 we are not going to be accepting new request. So the problem is we need to be in the house of the Lord by 9. We need to be here. So now there are requests that are coming late. So we are trying to extend the the grace to accept them but that is not okay because the pastor is not happy about that. So I have requested the elders that is it possible that if maybe we can put the time to past 9 so that we close the 15 minutes we'll try just to finish up everything so that at 9:30 we should be also in the house of the Lord. Are we happy about that? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I just want to extend my apology from the pastor that we need to do the right thing and follow the church order. The church order is not for you only but as well as us as elders and deacons. We also need to follow the church order. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this morning we are happy to announce that our brother Mara will be coming back in the pullpit to give us the word for today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So as the pastor has assigned We are happy. God bless you all. As we all stand up and sing our song &gt;&gt; to welcome our precious brother. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the voice of the angel when he He shall be to [Music] our God as he has to prophets. Behold you [Music] pro and day and he shall The hearts of their fathers to their children [Music] of their children to their father. Yes, I come. Yes, I might end [Music] up. [Music] Holy Ghost [Applause] with power is very [Music] host. [Music] [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I greet you this morning, &gt;&gt; in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, thanking him for everything for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I've got the greetings from the pastor once more this morning. He says, "Shalom." Shalom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh he told me that, "The Lord willing." Always the pastor says, "The Lord willing." The Lord willing, within a week or so, &gt;&gt; he will be here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh he said when you see pastor Magua coming he will be there as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To see the church. How were you doing physical handshake? &gt;&gt; Because he love you so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's the message I got from him. &gt;&gt; We believe the Lord will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we thank God for everything. &gt;&gt; Even myself this morning. I thank God because I think I I achieved what I wanted to achieve. in terms of the series of the messages that I was preaching because today is the last sermon of the series I wanted to bring to the church because we will talk about eternity. We'll talk about the new city, the new Jerusalem. you know, back there. Uh, we're talking about the current situation, the rapture, and tribulation, the battle of Armageddon, the millennium, white throne, judgment, and now is the final stage, the new heaven and the new earth. is eternity. That's what I'm going to talk about this morning. And I want to ask prayers also from the child of God. You must just pray for me and for my family as well because tomorrow I'll be going on exile. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will see you during the convention. So I'll be in Zambia on business then I will come back again. We will be together again. So just be with me in prayer and pray for you as well. I've shared this with the pastor as well. And one thing we agreed on is to baptize the people in Zambia. So I believe you will have a sister church there myself the only best thing I can do is just to tell the people about Lord Jesus Christ if they believe they believe because this message is for them that believe to believe it. So our God is a good planner. As human beings, we might be shortsighted on certain things, but God knows better. I'm one person that I said even previously. I I'm one person who even said it previously that I'm always on a relaxation mode because I know everything that happened in my life. God knows about it. There was never a mistake. If you think anything that happens to your life, it's a mistake or you could have done better, think twice. God planned everything for a reason. So as a child of God, relax. Well, relax is not a problem because when you relax, you think sober. When you are angry, emotional, you regret later for what you have uttered. So saints, relax in the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; God has done all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was just greeting you by so saying may God richly bless you. We are going to read the scripture in Revelation chapter 31 I mean 21 verse 1 and three. Before we reach, I've seen our elder here from if he's not far while we sing, he may come forward for a prayer. Amen. [Music] We have a twee.

Lord, [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; we are very much thankful. &gt;&gt; Let's read from the Bible. &gt;&gt; We're reading from Revelation chapter 21. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From verse 1 to3. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. &gt;&gt; And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We may be seated. When our elder is praying, remind me of the message I was listening yesterday. The pastor was preaching about the two seats. So I was listening to that message. Then in that message he said &gt;&gt; Joshua &gt;&gt; Joshua &gt;&gt; couldn't be by God couldn't be by God as long as Moses is alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. The pastor was preaching and saying that as long as Moses said, &gt;&gt; God will talk to Moses. Then he go further and say, "Don't try anything. As long as I'm still alive, hear me." So I said, "Amen." Amen. So let's just leave lift pastor's hands. He's there. God will speak to him. Pastor will influence us and we will preach the message. Amen. Amen. Here it speaks about the new heaven, the new earth, the first heaven and the first earth. There's a holy city and there's a new Jerusalem. So what I'm going to talk about today, who will be in that new seat? Amen. Amen. is my message today. God richly bless you. Now I read from the future home. &gt;&gt; The man of God says, "The new city and the new earth, the new creation, the new city on the hill with the throne in the top of it." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The throne is up there and there are dwellers all up and down on this mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the walls that's around this had 12 foundations. Each one of them had the stone was in or the the breast stone that was in Aaron which represented the 12 tribes of Israel. And in the gates, they had four gates set exactly like the temple in the wilderness, like the tent that was in the wilderness. Notice each one had the apostle. Three each side apostle And it was 144 cub high 144 cub. &gt;&gt; 144 cub is exactly 246 ft. &gt;&gt; 144 164 ft &gt;&gt; making each one of those big stone almost 20T longt. The breastplate in that gate breastplate making up that wall that was around the sea. That is the new Jerusalem. If I can see my first light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God said to Moses the other day, &gt;&gt; "Make the tabernacle as I've shown you in heaven. That means there was a tabernacle in heaven and God took it put down here and he said to Moses, "Do it here on this earth like the one I've shown you." So that means whatever Moses was doing he had influence from heaven. Whatever you are doing check if is the heavenly influence. Moses followed what heaven has told him. Look at the slide there. In those days there were 12 patriarchs. &gt;&gt; The 12 patriarchs being the son of Israel. They were 12. As 12 as they are became the foundation of what God has started. And as the time goes by, we see our Lord Jesus Christ having 12 disciples again. So it was a pattern of 12 from heaven going to the Old Testament. We see the pattern of 12 from Old Testament to the New Testament. So 12 + 12 And when you get to the book of Revelation, you find the 12 patriarchs and the 12 disciples to make 24 elders. Amen. That means to begin with 24 elders and to end with is 24 elders. &gt;&gt; Amen. If God starts something, he will finish it exactly the way. Can you see that? The very same pattern that we have is the very same pattern that was there. &gt;&gt; You cannot minus or deduct or add. It happened exactly. When you look at that pattern the 24 elders there are a lot of activities that happens there. So we'll go and check what are those. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you look at that the east, &gt;&gt; the west, the north and the south. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are 12 patriarchs. But in between, right in the middle of east, west, south, we found the Levites, the chosen ones that will serve the rest of them. And the Bible says that is the pattern that Moses got it from God. And then you go into the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Second slide, you will realize that the 12 apostle or the 12 disciples they are in the east, the west, north and south. They are there protecting something that should be in the middle. Right there in the middle, we see the book of acts. But brother Brennham says it's not the book of acts is the book of the holy ghost is the holy ghost in action. The holy ghost in the saints. And when you look at there, it is the beginning of the bride of Jesus Christ. That's where the Lord Jesus Christ started his bride, right in the middle. When you are protected by the gospel of the disciples of Jesus Christ, you are protected. God has done that. before the foundation of what are you scared of today? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says there in the middle is us there in the middle in the Old Testament &gt;&gt; is the Levites there in the New Testament is us. Then he started building his pride until when you get to eternity. Also look in the middle that's where the attraction is in the eternity. When you look in the middle is the bride is that chosen woman. You were chosen by God before the foundation of the world, irrespective of the condition. That's why when you love a woman, you love her unconditional once you put condition to the court for divorces. Amen. And in the gates, they had four gates set just exactly like the temple in the wilderness. Notice each one of the apostle each. Now on the east when you find the patriarchs three of them you find the disciples three of them east west why there's something important they protecting there but they do not protect because there is harm in the word of God there's no harm is the pattern that God once us to worship him to edify his name because God is God of all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the city length by breath by height is the same &gt;&gt; 1500 miles. 1500 miles &gt;&gt; and brother Brennham says how many were there when I preach about that seed and I measured the seat he was there measuring the seed gave us the report he said I was there measuring it look at brother Bren he said the only person that can measure the seed himself person that can reveal the seal unto the people God himself. But we see a man who was born a woman and a man opening the seals for God and John worship him. Brother Brenham said I'm one of you and worship me. The word of God come to a place whereby the people who love to worship you because when they see the characteristics of are in you but a man will say let's worship God don't worship me. It will go there until they say you make yourself God. Even if you don't, but they look at you and they see God. The reason why they killed Jesus Christ, it was for this reason. You being a man, make yourself go. Brothers and sisters, you are a man. And the people will say, you will make yourself go. Because why? They see God in you. They won't say to a woman, "But you make yourself God." There's no characteristics of God there. But the worippers, they will say they make themselves God. Because they see the characteristics just keep on going on the line. The people will make you honest. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because one was saying they they will hate you because the demons in them irritate. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that kingdom &gt;&gt; in the days of those kingdom there were Gentiles kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. And even today is Gentiles kingdom. They they have started and they will come to an end. Those kingdoms the kingdom that the kingdom that will stand is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ that will stand eternally. That is why this morning I'm speaking about eternity. Rapture is time. Millennium is time. White throne judgment is time. We are still in time. But once we pass the white throne judgment, we enter into eternity. There's no more time. We are in eternity. And that's what we are talking about today. When we get there, it's eternity. But I thank God this already. Those that belongs to God are of God. They will be of God. They shall be with God eternally. For God said to Moses, "Do this because of what I show you." He It was there already in heaven. Just do it as I showed you in because God opened heaven and show Moses. God open heaven and show it to brother Brandon. When brother Brenham come and tell you that I saw you there because God showed him who the bride is even saying one was trying to take an offer but the man of God says come back to the life if we take off let's come back to their life. Brother Brenham saw us there. If &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham &gt;&gt; saw you there and you are quite sure, whatever you're doing, you do it looking there. For Moses was told by God, do it as I show you there. Live a life that belongs to you as you were that person. Don't start a new thing. Amen. Amen. Live according to the way you pray. The bride of Jesus Christ being us never started here. This is the manifestation or the vindication of who we were. Amen. Amen. If we were of God, we will remain of God, nothing here on earth will shift us. If someone has a reason to backslide is for him but nothing can separate us from the love of God. We continue now because that is in a shape. See what I've got this shape here like the pyramid. The arising of the saints make the march into glory. Do you understand it? Now Christ is the headstone, the rejected stone, the allseen eye coming exactly like the Bible. Daniel said he watched this gentile age until the stone come out of the mountain that wasn't cut with hands. They had never put a capstone on that pyramid. Wasn't cut by man's hand. Is God's hand that cut the stone? You see it? &gt;&gt; It hit right the image on the feet &gt;&gt; and it broke into pieces. &gt;&gt; Grounded to powder. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; What happened that time? coming of that stone up went the church into glory at the rapture because it ended the gentile dispensation. God ended it up the coming of Amen. &gt;&gt; We can try to accumulate everything of this world but the man of God says anything what you see with an because at the beginning it will has an end. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now as the children of God we will look beyond what we can see with the if you can look beyond you are more than a conqueror is what God needs. Now you've got the city. You've got the city. It's a holy mountain. The city is a mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing shall hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain. The city is not a cubed. It's a mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The width breath, &gt;&gt; height, length, everything equal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That city is where we are longing to be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know the story of a frog &gt;&gt; that won the race? &gt;&gt; It was there were frogs going up. When they are up there, the other one just go up. The others were discouraging. They think he's going to die and they were thinking about it. The others looked down and they fell. When they tried to check how did this frog manage to win the race, they realized that the frog was deaf. What they said to the frog, what they said to the frog, you start here, you finish there and the frog goes. What the people said outside the frog doesn't hear looking at the finishing point. Brothers and sisters, a Christian journey is not an easy journey. Brother saying we are not sleeping in a flowery bed. Go up. Go up. When you are going up, the people discouraged. Go up. When the people try to stop you, go up because the point is the new city. That's where we want to go. But as we go, there will be discouragement along the way. There will be bad mouthing along the way. There will be challenges along the way. But close your ears up. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Christian community, we need genian Christians. For the Bible says Joshua and Caleb being part of Israel, but they had another spirit. We need a church today that will have another spirit like Joshua and Ka when they go and spy in Ka. The other 10 came back with different report. Joshua and Caleb, come back and say as the Lord says, we are going there. That is our place. We need such people today. We need people like Shedrach when I read about them in the Bible, they were young men and unmarried. But the men and the women that have been longing in Israel failed and worship the dragon. But the young men would rather die. We need them today. Men and women will compromise the gospel. So you young menel &gt;&gt; stand up for this message. Amen. &gt;&gt; For there's a holy seat where we are going. No one should separate us from the love of God. You keep on moving and moving standing as you believe. Amen. Maybe they were standing next to the elderly people. But I will not worship the God of Babylon. Amen. &gt;&gt; God whom we worship is God of the individual [Applause] not God of the groups. Brother said so is God of the individual. If you have a group is your group but God is God of individual. I said the city will on to my opinion will be sitting right on the ground where prophet Abraham set for that seed. when there will be no more sea. Why there's no more sea? There's no more sea because in the sea is where the devil hide. Even if you can go deeper in this demon things, the sangas, there are those that goes to the mountain. There are those that goes to the river. But the most powerful ones are those that goes to the sea. When they come back there, they come back stronger. They are just demons. So that is why God will finish everything where the devil hides in that new city. There's no sea. There's no hiding place of the devil. The Bible said there'll be no more sea which about 34 of the earth is in water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there will be no more sea. &gt;&gt; So it won't be too too big a city sitting in a place like that. I believe it will set in that little place where they fo about. And where God was born there in Bethlehem, I believe it will be right along in that Palestine day where it will raise up out of the earth right there be that mountain. You know the entire world has ever asked themselves. We've got America, we've got Russia, we've got China, we've got Africa, we've got Europe, we've got Canada, we've got many continents and many countries. Amen. Amen. But the entire world is looking at the Palestine there in Palestine. Brennan says is where the city will erupt in that little you know country there in that place Bible says Abraham was walking looking for a seed. He was being guided by God. But one of the days when he was walking somewhere when he stepped God came and meet him from the place where God met Abraham that's where the city for Israel is the chosen nation. The bride is the chosen woman. You are the chosen one. Brother says, "You are sinless. &gt;&gt; You are spotless. You are without wrinkle. you are that believe it. But looking at your mistake, you can see that you won't make it to heaven. You you just lied before you come to church. You know, God is a good God. One of the days Peter left the message doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Even the person we trust, he's gone. He's gone. &gt;&gt; We are dead. We are finished. There's no way we can go. But God said, Peter, I gave you the keys. The keys of heaven. He never took them back. They still with Peter. He said the day you are transformed, strengthen your brethren. When God started something, you will finish it. But if you are with a people, you made a mistake or you started something, they started to count. You remember 1989, you remember 2012. You remember 2022. Now it's 2025. It's you again. That's a human being. But God said, "When I forgive you, I forget it." For I put in the forgetfulness. And I want to be honest with this woman. We go to heaven because of our deeds honestly. None of us will go to heaven. Don't tell me you can. You will be lying to me. This is the grace and the mercy of God in the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is it God so thought and care so much about that little place called Palestine when it's just a little spot but right there where the temple is set the physical temple of Jerusalem that's where the new Jerusalem will break up right there. &gt;&gt; Olive mountain or Mount of Olive &gt;&gt; shall leave shall part right and left when she pushes up from belief. Not they say is pushing apart but it's pushing up when he stand his holy feet upon the mountain. Notice on the throne 1500 miles high 1500 miles high length by breath is equal. That big seat God has made for the bride. Brothers and sisters, if you are the bride this morning, you don't have a right to be angry. You have the right to smile. You say whatever the people say. There's a city beyond the sky that I'm going to. That's where we are going. Don't be discouraged. &gt;&gt; Now that city has got owners. &gt;&gt; The owner of that city, &gt;&gt; it's yourself. God has built it for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I read and God Christ is our bridegroom. We are the bride. This is the other part of the covenant God made for his people with Christ. [Music] Christ up as a memorial set for the Holy Spirit as his covenant with his people. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that city is for us. Just imagine the people in the Old Testament. They lived the word of God. They lived the word of God. And but in the new city, they will be your servant. You will be the one that is in the city. Amen. Amen. They will ask permission from you for you for them to reach you. They pass either the eastern gate or the western gate or the northern gate or the southern gate to get inside. You will be there. You don't need a permission to go out inside, go all over because this thing was made for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like a man and a wife, the wife, the wife has everything owns everything. [Music] Amen. Amen. You know men work and just bring money in their house but the women are very much good in using money. They just do everything in the house. Go and look at the can be a big house or a nice house of a man who's alone. You could there &gt;&gt; you could see there's a wife missing in here. Hey brother, there's a sister missing here. &gt;&gt; You being able, &gt;&gt; but you still miss need a sister because that union, it makes things work better. That is why God was just alone. But at the end, he has the bride in that city. The woman that should be in that seat, it's yourself. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we we we we see these things &gt;&gt; and you know on a daily basis it's likened unto what God is teaching us. He liken it in many parables like in a husband and wife. He calls the church the bride and the bride is no longer and the bridegroom is no longer two people. They are one. She's the flesh of his flesh, the bone of his bone. And then when a man and a woman is called a mystical body of Christ Jesus by the Holy Spirit, they become a full member of his body when they filled with the Holy Ghost because God took the spirit out of Christ. raise up his body, place it on the throne, and send back the Holy Spirit to make the mystical body of Christ, which will be united at the merit at the coming of the Lord. You cannot organize it. It is a mystery, men and God. has come together. Bride and the bridegroom. Heaven and earth have embraced each other. God has come down to dwell amongst men. Tabernacle is with them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God and us are one. groom and the bride are one. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are certain men that hide behind them. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't want to give you something, you say, "Hey, no, my wife doesn't." Because a bride &gt;&gt; is the reflection. of the groom. If he can say the wife doesn't agree, you won't repeat. You just stop. In actual fact, he's the one who doesn't woman. She was just reflected. If you try to hide yourself, &gt;&gt; you are woman. The one who show who you are. If Christ Jesus is behind since well he injected us with his spirit expose him. Now when the people look at her they say you being a man you make yourself God because they see the characteristic. Amen. Amen. Then the bride will come to be with the groom and the groom with the bride. And then great millennium after the whole world is destroyed by eternal and there will be new heavens and the new earth and they shall live together. Amen. Amen. So if the groom is with us, we becomes untouchable. No one can harm us because the groom is here. No one can touch us because the angels has protected us. You are right in the middle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When you look on the side, it's the disciples is their ministries. But that ministry is protecting you, children of God. The ministry of the disciples of the apostles has protected you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. the the slide of the pyramid. &gt;&gt; H slide a pyramiding. &gt;&gt; H if they can show us the slide of the pyramid. Why must the bridegroom be the word manifested made plain? Is because the bride and the bridegroom are one. She is just meeting piece of him. There is the masterpiece masterpiece. &gt;&gt; It was smitten referring to this one. Amen. When you look at this pyramid, the bride and the groom, they inside. But those blue dot around there are people that God has allowed them to be there with the mercy of God to enjoy the life eternal. The point of attraction is the one that is inside and inside there the lamp is the light. There's no sun, &gt;&gt; there's no moon, &gt;&gt; there's no sea. We are the one that are inside shineth by the light of the lamb because my title is about simultaneous appearance. After the white throne judgment, when we are being ushered to the new season, the people that disbelieve the word of God into hell. Burning hell now. &gt;&gt; So now there's no bailing hell. But after the white throne judgment there is burning hell and hell and hell is not eternal. Brother Benham speak about the eternal &gt;&gt; and the everlasting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somewhere somehow those that are burning in hell, they will come to an end are no more. Those that believe the word of God will pass judgment life eternal and we have life eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have life eternal, keep on moving. The bride goes wherever the groom is. She will never be left by him. She will never leave his side. She will share the throne with him. She will be the crown with the glory. You know in those old days as a bride or the wife of the king you were not just allowed to see the king. You needed the appointment. If you go without the permission, you might be killed. But Esther prayed God that I should meet the king with or without the permission of anybody. Then she went there and the king have mercy on her because the wife of the king. The king is obliged to protect the queen. We are obliged to protect our bride. I don't want to go further that one. They can excommunicate you, but let's protect the queens. &gt;&gt; The marriage of the land it's like our natural weddings. You know, when you go to a wedding, we go there, &gt;&gt; it's nice, everybody's here and then the groom will come then and then there goes the No, there's no when the groom come. There's but when the bride comes the important one is the bride. When the bride enter the veil on that's when we clap and we brothers and sisters when we enter in that seat the people that are there are ready late welcome us as we'll be entering in the new city that our groom us Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are the most important person in the e economy of God. &gt;&gt; It's just that you haven't seen it. Brother Brandham said it. I saw you there. [Music] If you can get that confirmation, you won't have a problem anymore. Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride goes wherever the the groom is. Now he the groom, the bridegroom took away your shame. When a brother is getting is marrying the sister, he took away the shame. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know You know sometime the sisters are sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The sisters are sisters &gt;&gt; when when that sometimes in the church they are clapping hands or they are raising hands they use this one to show they don't use the right one but they have that pride of like hallelujah. Can't you see? &gt;&gt; Yes. Just look at it. You &gt;&gt; But it's us. We We are very much proud about the husband who married us. We'll keep on saying hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let the world know that we got married to a man. Yes, Lord Jesus. That is why he took our shame and we are not shame of him wherever we go. We talk about him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he put he put it our shame. in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a verse in the Bible saying the devil was always reporting us to God. But the book of revelation say the one that report us to God does not have a chance. Why he look at our red sea the the red sin with the red blood of our Lord Jesus Christ is see white. Now we start to be proud. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible say. Your first husband that you were married to the world, the anointed bridegroom with four ordained you has washed you by the washing of the water by the church or which that don't sound right. You might find that in the almanic &gt;&gt; but not in the go's bible. by the washing of the water, by the weight in the weight. That's what he did to us. Can I tell you something? Not because you've done something good before. He just loved you unconditionally. Now you are pure vicuous sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and wash in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stand as though you never sin the earth. You are perfect. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ has cleans you. Let me ask you. If you are pure, you are vicious, you are sinless. What more do you want? The word of God stand for you as you have never seen. at the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our God is a good God. &gt;&gt; It's like having your own self maybe is living this kind of life out there then you will they will come and report Amen. Amen. That your son is doing this and this Then you will say, "Yeah, &gt;&gt; yeah." &gt;&gt; Then you then they report. &gt;&gt; Then they keep on reporting. You'll end up saying, "Yeah, it's my son. &gt;&gt; Leave him as he is." That's what God did to us. The devil was reporting us. And he's very much good. He put you in trouble. You put you in trouble. and deport you. God has sinned. God has sinned and said to the devil, "Yeah, it's my son. It's my daughter. I'll sort him out." What he did, he died for you in the cross. When he look at you, he look at you as a vicious someone, a sinless someone, someone that is pure because the flesh cannot be perfect. There's a being &gt;&gt; inside you. That one &gt;&gt; is perfect. That one is the one that comes from God. That one is the one that worship God. That one is the one that will inherit in the city of God. Not this one. This one was born in 19 so but that one our pastor normally teach us it was not born it was processed from God is this way God was alone then he take out his attributes being us and put us there and build a city for us. We are no longer preaching like God in us or us in God. But in the city, it's him and us. We are one, but he's there. We are there. We talk to him. He's talking to us. Let me give you an example. Like a young man, you are young, you get married and one of the say we we say let the young man stand up &gt;&gt; while you have your wife psychiatric hospital. Exactly what God did. He was one being one. He took us out of him. Now God is no longer one. He is the groom. We are the bride. And that will happen eternally. [Music] Future home. Future home. &gt;&gt; Every day we are traveling. We are in a journey. You take you you need to ask yourself where will you spend your eternity. I'm not saying this for the sake of saying it but those that are of God they will know that they will spend their eternity with God. Can I tell you this? A complete job was done. When God starts something, there's no amendment along the way. He will complete it perfect. &gt;&gt; Future home. Future home. It speaks of eternity. Where will you spend your time in heaven? You travel like a dog. You know, in the new city, the bride is inside. If you feel like he's outside the city, you are there. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you feel like you want to talk to Daniel, you think about him. He is there. That's what will happen in the new city. will be traveling like a th struggling on a weekly basis but the future home give us comfort. You know we are all human beings apps not because you have money or you are learned but because you are a human being emotions anger anxiety frustration harm still when you have what the world needs. But when you are going on those up and down only comfort that will come to you is the new seat. You just tell yourself well things are not okay in my life but there's a future home one of the days I will reach my hope beyond the sky. That's what can comfort you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can only say Lord give us our daily bread where you did not speak about budget. Reading about a man who had a money until he didn't know what to do with his own money. Every one of us here needs money until the the other day his daughter was called then he took money &gt;&gt; to warm to warm the daughter. Amen. because he realized life is better than money. But to others money is better than life. That is why they can kill for money. What belongs to God belongs to God. This one is eternity is where I come from. Our father God is drawing us back to eternity. For the new city was there before. He show it to Moses. He showed to Abraham. He showed to brother Ben. Showing it to us. That's where we are going. I cannot sin because where I come from eternity, there's no sin. If you recognize that you are in eternity, then you are in eternity. But most of the people, they don't think about them. They still relying what the world can give to them. We are preaching to the bride today, we are the bride because if our husband is alpha and omega, we are alpha and we are him. You cannot separate us. Amen. We we are no longer you know living in this world because the the inner man the real man the him is looking up to the new city brothers and sisters. Just be like that frog. Close your eyes and go up brothers and sisters. Just be like an eagle. Fly to the highest. Amen. &gt;&gt; As the other people are saying, if somebody is trying to pull you when you are flying high, it tells you that is lower than you are high. Go high and higher. As the prophet says, we have passed the curtain of time. We are no longer in the church ages. We are in the bride age. If we are in the bride age, the devil will do us no harm. Christ and the bride will speak the same language. One mind, one spirit [Music] is us and him. Amen. &gt;&gt; The the seven seal open up what it was. &gt;&gt; The seven seal open up &gt;&gt; what it was. It was a past. We were somewhere. When the seals are open today, it's just telling us who we were. What is all open there? The bride. What is all open? The bride should preach of what it was and bring into what it is today. Let's worship the present tense God. The bride if the Christ was made of what was the bride if Christ was made of what was and what she is now is what is happening today. The time we are living in the time we are living in is beyond time. We are the time of the church ages. Will pass the time of millennium. We'll pass the time of white judgment. When we get to eternity, there's no more time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a time when the word &gt;&gt; did not find the place in the people. That's what the pastor said the other day. Even if you preach harder and harder is not changing them because it won't help them. The reason why we come to the service is not because we are going to change our life. No, &gt;&gt; it's just that we are going to be more visible than yesterday. &gt;&gt; The word of God cannot change Satan to be saints. I'm trying to tell you that if we were the bride to begin with, we will remain the bride. We will be the bride. We will be with him eternally. We are the place. Even Satan prepare his people. God preparing his people. God has prepared us. The devil is preparing his people. I said it the other day. Allow me to say it today. This is a play whereby is between God and man between the devil and men. When you are in the middle, it's either you serve God or you serve the devil. There's no neutral place. So when we are in a journey, you will find the people that are serving God. You will find the people that are saving the devil. But we are in the journey together. You look at the people that goes for marathon. They start together in numbers. When they go in numbers but position one and two and three the rest along the journey. That is why if such marathon comes why they know along the way others will fall along the way others will need water along the way others will need stretcher along the way others will need medication But there must be a winner. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ is the winner. Is the chosen. Brother Brandham says we are a chosen church. There are churches. But we are a chosen church. And brother again says the bride of Jesus Christ. It's universal. Amen. We can be mad big in numbers not guarantee that we are all going to be raptured as a natural wedding destroy this bride and they are just accomp bride bridesmaid there somewhere. &gt;&gt; We need the bride &gt;&gt; on the other side. We need the bride and the groom exactly is happening. Be careful. &gt;&gt; Don't be a bridesmaid and then you come in. They say you and That's why there's four gates, east, west, north, and south. When are they to grant permission to the city? And that city was made for the bride. Who is the bride? The bride is from the first church age until the last church age. I mean I mean that is the bride as the Bible says let who has an ear take what the spirit says that is the bride only those people are the bride the rest are not the bride but God because he's God of mercy he's so gracious he will allow them to partake paid in the holy city but not as the bride. The bride is the one that will be in charge of everything but the rest might need the permission from. Amen. Now in our homes if somebody's asking something from the father check with the mother And then he then looks aside when the mother says no I'm not giving him I don't have power you hurt yourself even if they even even if they don't agree the women &gt;&gt; they have power to control &gt;&gt; the wealth if you see a family it's a giving image is because the heart of a woman and the heart of a man are together in the family is natural. You see it when you get to marry your right partner at the end at the end people think that you are a brother and a sister. Brother Brenham says until even your heart beat like the same I'm trying to tell you that if Christ Jesus is in us, there's no difference between the bride, they are one and whatever they doing, they do it together. [Music] So the natural &gt;&gt; type the spiritual what cry or in our natural life what is happening to us is happening to the lord Jesus Christ with his bride. Amen. Amen. That's where we are heading to. Amen. Amen. That's what I wanted to share with the children of I will be going somewhere till we meet again. Amen. Keep on moving forward. Things are in control. Don't even worry. Let's stand to our feet and sing unto the Lord. [Music] Yes. Meaning [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] sh.

Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
