TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he took the book from himself now I can ask you a question do you have book the seven Church ages he responsible for the seven responsible for the seals so if you read in the book ofs Revelation 10 [Applause] Cen coming to meet theel they bring the and together again now I must and with woman the is the seed and to multiply must be given to a woman woman Messenger to bring the message marage message to bring and thef the woman all the BR the fulfills the way this is the the Min of [Applause] today in the heart of men Mighty the Mighty God before [Applause] [Music] us the prophet says one he Israel had a secret they knew that God was [Applause] behind is behind your amen okay now in closing listen to this one change in because say the whole thing is God [Music] [Applause] and you believe that God is in you now manifestation manifest is revelation the way way not in book [Applause] a prophet will [Applause] prophesy and when it's fulf then said this [Applause] ises fulfillment is where that prophecy becomes the in man ISF because what prophesied of and they thought that they were with new wine [Applause] it's [Music] a propy is now a man the of onah when Isaiah when put on FL and he say they say to him who are you what do you say of yourself I am and Isaiah 7 Isaiah 9 [Applause] [Music] [Applause] am so the three wise men came to the Fulfillment propy that's why I will say again the shall be in the the mind of God be in the we in the take it from of Christ and wom one question became one officer because he here of us because the husband ISAC and just to satisfied to Christ Christ is the hallu soul in [Music] prison he says now we bu that nature that soul for the Bible says take off the old now we are the nature [Applause] amen and we don't do our own will then he says the mind that's what things is the Mind say the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer you know the Bible speaks of the mind of your thoughts the mind of your heart says a Christian thinks with their not their head of their thoughts of their heart say the mind that was in Christ now listen what he say what that the soul now the mind of [Applause] Christ which is the new the one that came after yeah the one that came after [Applause] is the mind of Christ let me pass it to you that the seven seal is the [Applause] mind and while the people looking up in heaven the ministry you see I will I will repeat that qu [Applause] again says the problem with Israel is that when they wanted to see God they saw a man they were waiting for m then every time somebody comes when John comes they ask him are you the [Applause] Messiah every time somebody would come they would say are you the Messiah that's what amen God said I will send you El in the of el for they see so they didn't see because the ministry also confused them because he said the Lamb of God [Applause] knows on four legs Poss a person will look for the L and they were confused and the says cried out the two disciples speak and follow [Applause] without and after so they nothing amen behold the L of God now today that was the same thing behold open and the them am why because what blinded the people is the way God [Music] revealed what really wor the sons of the Hebrews in [Applause] Egypt was delivered them let's close with thish says I will come and deliver out of the bondage of EGP with my now they waiting forh PR and mes was running away because [Music] doesn't talk about killing of a man or what else he remember his Cen so in Egypt the Jews the Hebrews are still stilling to come the next thing here comes Moses [Applause] [Applause] they rejected because they are waiting for JE amen he rejected Jesus Christus Christ am but they W for the m so Jesus came contrary to the Messiah they could even say this we know his brothers are here father part of [Applause] it did you hear of any marriage between Jose Andy before he comes Messiah come out of [Applause] [Applause] WL look at Bethlehem he was born there in [Applause] you think to open the wory to open the [Applause] then the Angels Came Ang now Ang they didn't know about Wings my WIS IUN because it looks like me the wings is just the form of the ministry there [Applause] but the Heavenly Angels knew nothing about the S angels six he knows very well the seven is the and he says thisel is theel with the seven seal theen and the prophet says already here yeah you what is going to take you away is already in you that is he came with and the says the shall come from the East so that's why the if he was placed Eastward that means he was coming from the west to east the Garden of Eden because Eden is the headquarters of God the Garden of Eden is the head this is and even today in the message we are in the headquarters I said yesterday the embassy if you want to go to heav come to us we have the C want to know we are the empass here okay so we have the book complete book no on the right hand here with us our you know the prophet say your name because you are revealed it is the day of your Redemption the people who see the is the people that areed they see their names says this members of the Bri see their names they hear their names being called open saw name [Applause] name only the book reveals who Paul is receive the mystery that that's when you hear the name called the name you will receive a revelation May [Music] of in the book A ration [Applause] says Gabriel the pastor here receives a revelation this is how we hear his name called [Applause] that's say Gabriel so that's when the wrong call is made that's when the wrong call is made when the Lord Jesus came into the syue when they off SC he open exactly the part that pertains or that concerns him he of the Lord is upon me and the Bible says after reading looking at him and he said to them never said it your heart thises says the this scriptures fill in your [Music] ears [Music] oh
