TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Brother, it's not only the spoken word. &gt;&gt; It should be God. [Applause] You know, God is not kept in a bag like this. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. &gt;&gt; The spoken word is in the bag, but God is in the heart. &gt;&gt; With the power, &gt;&gt; not 99%. No, the power of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, the bride also &gt;&gt; when the prophet left, &gt;&gt; he said, &gt;&gt; "What was once in the mind of God is now in the heart." &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother never said 77% of it. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; he says what was once in the mind of God. Then you read your spoken word is the original word &gt;&gt; where he where he says this is the secret &gt;&gt; the word &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; is in the &gt;&gt; he never said a sermon &gt;&gt; because &gt;&gt; God is the way &gt;&gt; not amen Sometimes you hear nice say I was blessed today so so &gt;&gt; and the next day you are &gt;&gt; set you must receive the way [Applause] amen &gt;&gt; so there was no man &gt;&gt; God will get amen the man is God's partner Amen. &gt;&gt; He will do something and send it to men &gt;&gt; to do the rest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He blinds poor soul and sent him to &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For anas to you the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cornelius pray prayed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And God said send one for Peter. &gt;&gt; Amen. and Peter from Job. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's the other part of the other part. So he must have one thing and one reserve for &gt;&gt; now if you read in the Bible always God has never the Lord Jesus even brother says when he was on earth he didn't do all things &gt;&gt; because one part belongs to them. The hidden things are of the Lord but the reveal of men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Now Adam has the the other part. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God had to share with Adam. &gt;&gt; Now he has created but he want somebody a man &gt;&gt; to come and do the rest. And there was no man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, so he had to bring down the spirit into &gt;&gt; the body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We have it. &gt;&gt; Right. Now we come back again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now with s &gt;&gt; not creation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. God said the Bible says there was no man to till the ground. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was no man wasting &gt;&gt; you see always there is no man there is no man &gt;&gt; that means men plays an important role as [Music] &gt;&gt; because it's always there is no man &gt;&gt; there is no man &gt;&gt; so there is now no man worth there is a man but not a worthy man &gt;&gt; why because You read your [Music] who is this &gt;&gt; Mechisedc? &gt;&gt; It says you bypass your &gt;&gt; theophedraise God. Amen. Because you can't test that the &gt;&gt; can you [Applause] &gt;&gt; now there was no men who because &gt;&gt; in the system of God &gt;&gt; that was the spirit in the form of rainbow and logos &gt;&gt; and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now some people don't believe that Jesus Christ was our substitute. &gt;&gt; He stood in our place where we were supposed to be. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brennham says God required a kingsman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A substitute. &gt;&gt; Read your kingsman redeemer tells you that God look for a substitute. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] And God couldn't find a substitute anywhere. So he had to come himself &gt;&gt; and take a body and become our substitute. &gt;&gt; A substitute means he took our place &gt;&gt; and that's why says you know where there was he calls this thing he says after the fall &gt;&gt; then there was a gap. Yeah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Adam left the place. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God sent &gt;&gt; he had no he was running around. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He could only send God say to God send me &gt;&gt; you see. So now when he when he &gt;&gt; lost the place &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now the prophet tells you that the Lord Jesus came because this he says this became time &gt;&gt; he says now that's why the Lord Jesus came and took the body of time [Music] &gt;&gt; to do what? To sprinkle this place with blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have to come and sprinkle the cake &gt;&gt; because the whole thing is a cycle of [Music] &gt;&gt; now the was mad fall into time &gt;&gt; and then Adam where are you? Adam, he was still there. &gt;&gt; And God came down to the place because he cannot open up another place. &gt;&gt; God is a stronger. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know, I was so amazed and jumped with joy when when I did. Brother saying to me, &gt;&gt; you know, Job, Job, he he has lost his children. &gt;&gt; And says to me, you know, God restored his children. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he never repl [Music] when we come to predestination. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Moses said, "I can't even speak. I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do that." You'll be God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want somebody who can do it. [Music] You know, God don't deal with clevers. [Applause] Amen. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now the prophet says &gt;&gt; he sprinkled his blood. &gt;&gt; That's why now all the seven churches he says is me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now time you must have blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. But since you don't have blood, &gt;&gt; that &gt;&gt; is the redeemed. &gt;&gt; But every age is a mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Now here he says now for him to buy this back, &gt;&gt; he had to sprinkle his blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So to bring back to restore again and bring back the man &gt;&gt; to his original position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now there was no man to &gt;&gt; there was no man this time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was no man worthy. now. And when there was no man, &gt;&gt; h can I go back to that thing again? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. We can we can bring them together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. In in few minutes we are over here. They saying they're not &gt;&gt; I love this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now there was white &gt;&gt; now the white is within the pyramid &gt;&gt; where the prophet says he said to the people look in &gt;&gt; after Junior Jackson saw the prophet in a vision chopping off the top of that boulder there and inside within inside. That's how God &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; because the the pyramid represents the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We all know that seven steps to the king's ch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, h it says, brother Ben now says when it when it sorry for not reading because I'm just talking about the things they are here before. &gt;&gt; He says when it standard Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He saw something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the mystery was not the thunders. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; the mystery was something he saw. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he says when he saw that thing, he looked for interpretation. Amen. &gt;&gt; He couldn't interpret it &gt;&gt; where it says the mystery is beneath the sea. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The mystery is beneath the sea. So he couldn't interpret that. &gt;&gt; You want me to read it? &gt;&gt; Brother couldn't interpret this. &gt;&gt; The white stone &gt;&gt; which stands for the seventh se. It stands for the seven &gt;&gt; they couldn't inter &gt;&gt; within and there was no writing because &gt;&gt; the coming of the Lord was not on the letter form the mystery of God revealed. It says when John John was forbidden to write the history. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what God omitted there is the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And as it says the prophet maybe I have a book here. If I don't have I will quote that. &gt;&gt; You know the prophet says he he says here &gt;&gt; when God came to the seven he stopped there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He didn't go further said now I need a man. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; When he came to the seven &gt;&gt; he also stopped. [Music] that that is the thing that caused a lot of trouble. &gt;&gt; Brother says God said nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that is very good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why the people don't know anything [Music] &gt;&gt; because God said &gt;&gt; nothing. &gt;&gt; Nothing. If I going to uh maybe get into a conversation with you, &gt;&gt; uh verbally you hear what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But if I omit something and keep it in my heart, then you don't hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Of course. &gt;&gt; So the only the only way you can hear it &gt;&gt; if if there's between me and you &gt;&gt; and a network &gt;&gt; that can take this from my heart to your &gt;&gt; Now brother says when God comes to men he comes to his heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean the Bible but I must say brother say so that it can come closer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible even speaks of the thoughts of the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because with this &gt;&gt; you come with evolution. [Music] written the Bible where it says firstly apostles. &gt;&gt; God gave to the church for firstly apostles. Then the brother said oh firstly apostles that apostles are greater than [Music] apostleship is above a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Then he picks that they I've seen they pick now everybody today is called an apostle. &gt;&gt; I met people even in the denomination. &gt;&gt; I was with one brother. So this fire people and now that Okay. Now I was with this man. The phone calls that were coming in were apostle say I said oh yes an apostle who can't even see the baptism but he's an I will say I will sing to Elijah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He never said an apostle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And should God not send this man, &gt;&gt; both Gentiles and the Jews are lost. &gt;&gt; Because that man &gt;&gt; is the spokesman of God &gt;&gt; for the last time. &gt;&gt; And it says if God don't &gt;&gt; the whole world [Music] [Applause] All the mysteries will make. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Can we say all? All the mysteries &gt;&gt; were made known in brother &gt;&gt; I shall not be ashamed of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we'll see how we receive it. Pardon me for for for one minute. Let me look at this. Amen. &gt;&gt; All the mysteries. &gt;&gt; All the mysteries. &gt;&gt; All of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. No one after that. &gt;&gt; All the &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No one after Elijah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The seventh angel messenger. &gt;&gt; No one after that. &gt;&gt; After that is the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Elias picked up Rebecca. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That was all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he brought Rebecca to &gt;&gt; Isaac. &gt;&gt; That was all. &gt;&gt; Mighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What if somebody comes again and said, "Rebecca, I must help you. &gt;&gt; I'm in aosel." [Music] &gt;&gt; The sheer Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She's married to Isaac. &gt;&gt; And our Isaac is Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; After you got married, &gt;&gt; you don't need another marriage. You are married for the second time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To Christic [Music] somebody. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [Music] [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. [Applause] Now I challenge all the apostles and the message of the [Applause] Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, let me try to stick to &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here we are. Uh men the logos which here I am a &gt;&gt; will tell you that the logos is the &gt;&gt; and the lo is the way &gt;&gt; and it is Christ. &gt;&gt; So it's something that you could not see. &gt;&gt; Amen. H which was from the beginning which we have seen not with this eyes &gt;&gt; with this eyes &gt;&gt; we have handle of the way &gt;&gt; not in this &gt;&gt; hand &gt;&gt; now here we come in a threefold &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now there was no man worthy &gt;&gt; he could not be worthy because &gt;&gt; he byassed his father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now I'll read it to you that brother Bren, &gt;&gt; he says, "The mystery is beneath." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's quiet here. Is &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You look to heaven, you don't see anything. You don't hear anything. [Music] &gt;&gt; Angels stop their &gt;&gt; HS. &gt;&gt; Nothing going on &gt;&gt; in heaven. [Music] &gt;&gt; You hear nothing in heaven. &gt;&gt; You see nothing. God has switched off. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that no one can intercept. &gt;&gt; And then now if God wants to come to his throne &gt;&gt; which is the heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He can't bodily come into the heart. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; What is coming in to the heart is is the sin that is in him. What was in Christ to us &gt;&gt; in Jesus &gt;&gt; the the holy of holies there was this box. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of the covenant &gt;&gt; of the covenant &gt;&gt; which today stands for the soul of men &gt;&gt; which today stands for the heart of men. And now we see that that small box &gt;&gt; there. Now brother tells you now where they are today. &gt;&gt; In the heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So all those things were without &gt;&gt; but now today they are in [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't waste my time going with camera looking for a pill. [Music] [Applause] When the children of God were looking around for another law to keep, &gt;&gt; God said, "Now, this is the new covenant. &gt;&gt; I'm going to put them in." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, they used to keep the law &gt;&gt; and afterwards the law kept them. &gt;&gt; When it is in them, the Lord &gt;&gt; kept them. But when it is on the stone, they had to read from the stone. &gt;&gt; You know, somebody somebody drops three, somebody drops $30 and an Israelite now is looking at the stone shall not. &gt;&gt; And now he thinks thinking the prison. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there some ministers who stones ready to [Music] &gt;&gt; transgress the law. &gt;&gt; So now they they suffered under the law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because even if you you want to steal something, you look at the stone, it says thou shall not. &gt;&gt; Now God said you have failed. &gt;&gt; Now the thing I'm going to put inside Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us try to close here. &gt;&gt; There was no man to the ground. Let me read it quickly here and we w up here with Jews. The Jews what happened and what is happening right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this is the Gentiles &gt;&gt; with us the Gentiles. Now God came and brother repeats it. He says God said nothing about the seven. &gt;&gt; Then he says he open a six and stop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now where he stopped it is because if now you read it in the Bible you come the white horse you are coming. You are coming that is just in your mind &gt;&gt; where it stops you stop. Are you not going further? &gt;&gt; No. It says there's nothing here. &gt;&gt; Elijah said to his servant, "Go out, look to the sea." And there was nothing. &gt;&gt; He came back and said, &gt;&gt; "I see nothing." &gt;&gt; And Elijah said to him, My servant, you see nothing. There's nothing. &gt;&gt; But yet there was something. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now Elijah knew about the dimensions. Where a man would say there's nothing a prophet comes and say there [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; would say he said nothing will come and say something [Music] &gt;&gt; he said nothing in heaven but he said somethingmen [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Satan how he operates &gt;&gt; he he's always waiting &gt;&gt; for to intercept. Yeah, &gt;&gt; something is there. &gt;&gt; God sends the two Ps &gt;&gt; and and God said to brother Bren, &gt;&gt; you know the two Ps, &gt;&gt; the first and the second, &gt;&gt; that's the devil's playground. [Music] &gt;&gt; Even today, I've seen the on DVD of some people there in Manoi. That man stood and said, "God spoke to me something here." &gt;&gt; He asked the minister. He gossip in the eye of the tears of the minister that I feel the Holy Ghost saying something &gt;&gt; and he comes before the audience and say h there's a woman here with stomach ache and 15 women came for 15 now so I had pray for all the 15. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hitting them with this and &gt;&gt; Jesus [Music] I tell you one day won't allow me that they use black and white magic. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Yes. Everybody wants to be a super man &gt;&gt; so that when he comes to church he can just say Jesus [Music] &gt;&gt; have you seen Ben people like pick him [Applause] did that on school. &gt;&gt; No &gt;&gt; girls in their trousers. And people believe that from &gt;&gt; never never. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sorry. Let me finish &gt;&gt; now. H when Let me read it quickly so that we can Here, brother says, &gt;&gt; I'm going to read this part here. &gt;&gt; When he could not he waited for the interpretation, &gt;&gt; but he says he waited for the interpretation, a flying interpretation. We've seen it before. &gt;&gt; All right. And uh I'm going to make it this way that when he looked for interpretation &gt;&gt; and uh h the one that flew &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After he saw something he couldn't interpret. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now actually he calls that the the white stone mystery. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So he said to them, look into this and now if you can keep somebody looking at a white thing &gt;&gt; no writing no &gt;&gt; no nothing &gt;&gt; and say &gt;&gt; keep looking in here &gt;&gt; so now that's why he says but when I return &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; many of them [Music] Now for for a man &gt;&gt; to remain looking at a thing that's only when he sees something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; He is attracted by something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he can keep on looking. &gt;&gt; I always give my story that I saw with my brother-in-law how there were some doubts. Yeah. &gt;&gt; They were just walking around along the D in the wall &gt;&gt; and looking and they were looking like inside &gt;&gt; going around like this. &gt;&gt; So I was with my brother-in-law and he noticed that and said what's happening? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I looked at I don't know what is going on. Those DS are just looking but they looking at something around this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, now we went to investigate. What is it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is so attractive? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is so attractive in there? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I arrived, when we arrived, then we realized that they were looking at us. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; In the water. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This one is is looking at the image and &gt;&gt; now when we look at the white stone &gt;&gt; and the people wonder why we keep on looking [Applause] [Music] [Applause] We can see ourselves. &gt;&gt; John looked beyond. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said there's John in the church. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; John looking at John. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Where Not in the church age. &gt;&gt; Brother looked up one day and he said, "Who are you?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "I see [Applause] [Music] sport of &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Each and every one of us is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Let me start to look at [Music] I'm going to read where brother says he has a white stone and brother Brenham says you &gt;&gt; God has put a little stone in you. little white stone. &gt;&gt; Then then he preach a message that we must be be magnetized &gt;&gt; to the stone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you need to have that thing in you in order to magnetize &gt;&gt; now. Now I'm here. Listen, let me read it quickly. Uh now he saw some seven angels &gt;&gt; flying. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And uh he says um it banging. All right. I know that it was them seven uttering themselves right close together just banging seven different times and it it unfolded into something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now what we need to show the people is that something &gt;&gt; not the thunders because they have emptied &gt;&gt; themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when he saw that he said he refused to say now I look for the interpretation that flow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The interpretation that flew &gt;&gt; because seven seven angels of the earth interpreted the seven church &gt;&gt; but seven angels from heaven interpreted the white [Applause] &gt;&gt; so he saw seven angels coming from eternity &gt;&gt; with the interpretation of the wise the unwritten white [Music] have to do something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Because here you must have a writing. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember that now? Now we have some readers &gt;&gt; the people who can whose ministry is just to &gt;&gt; leave &gt;&gt; but no manifestation. I can give you one clip of it. How the mages came into Jerusalem &gt;&gt; and they found the ministers there. &gt;&gt; You know, all men just &gt;&gt; and now they they went in and said, &gt;&gt; "Where is he?" Oh, &gt;&gt; okay. &gt;&gt; Now listen, &gt;&gt; where is he? &gt;&gt; Because now they went through the reading &gt;&gt; dispensation &gt;&gt; time and now they were in another time. &gt;&gt; It's a scripture. &gt;&gt; They were coming for a man. You can run again and find Philip. How &gt;&gt; he rushed to his brother and said, "Come and see." &gt;&gt; The one whom Moses &gt;&gt; Now he's no longer a scripture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He used to be in the prophecy. &gt;&gt; But when the prophecy is fulfilled, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the prophecy is fulfilled, it's amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; John used to be Isaiah 4. When Isaiah 5 was fulfilled, it was [Applause] &gt;&gt; so you are a fulfillment &gt;&gt; of a scripture. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; I look for the interpretation. &gt;&gt; And now he says now, now let's listen. Now hear this part. 76. &gt;&gt; Now God was looking for a worthy man. &gt;&gt; Who is worthy? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he open he open a he he he drew out the mysteries out of himself &gt;&gt; because they were there in the holy of holies &gt;&gt; and in the temple of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God made sure that it should be that should be stored in a man &gt;&gt; who could not die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he died, he said h demolish this temple &gt;&gt; but on the third day &gt;&gt; I will restore it again. &gt;&gt; So that's where he restored his &gt;&gt; Yeah. So now then we see that when the seventh was to be open which is the greatest of all the you can have &gt;&gt; amen. Some people read and say I've read about this and that is good but the seven &gt;&gt; that is that is our way out &gt;&gt; that is our reenter [Applause] &gt;&gt; a ministry without the ser is a closed ministry &gt;&gt; because brotherham says The seven seals book closes the Bible. [Music] &gt;&gt; So if you come with the Bible and preach it A to Z. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why you see the people are doing like a chicken after it had his Eight neck cut off. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Ministry without [Applause] &gt;&gt; forgive me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes my shirt misbehave &gt;&gt; brothers let's now brother Benham says the reason &gt;&gt; now when they he could not interpret he went westward [Music] &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; to connect &gt;&gt; with the angels message &gt;&gt; because says when the seal is open it opens a new ministry. The ministry now is the seven seal &gt;&gt; because that is Christ. &gt;&gt; So now he says, let me read it now. You know it. I just read for to keep time. The reason I had to go was to connect with this angel's message to come back here to reveal it to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The thing is as it says here now, brother Brillam says, I came to reveal it to the church. &gt;&gt; Who revealed it? Now &gt;&gt; fear not to say &gt;&gt; but I will ask how. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. The level. But &gt;&gt; how did he do it? [Music] &gt;&gt; Here's your book here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The people the reason they couldn't see him, &gt;&gt; they stood the man. &gt;&gt; They come to see God and they see a man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. page 17 of your the unveiling of God. &gt;&gt; They they come to see God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; He says this is what blinded them. &gt;&gt; And he says again page 34. Page 34 is the same thing again. He says the gentile church has also been blinded [Music] &gt;&gt; from the veil &gt;&gt; after it's been tore off and show it show God &gt;&gt; the atlast the the atlesiestical veil how &gt;&gt; by veiling the word in human being again &gt;&gt; amen because he says now that the the son of men is after the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; He says the son of man is revealed back to the church of God. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; which is the holy ghost. &gt;&gt; What the the way what the spirit says to the churches. &gt;&gt; But now after that is the because if you come to the seven church age &gt;&gt; it's where it says grief not the holy spirit. You have seen until &gt;&gt; now until the day of redemption we see the sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People are being selected and set aside as overcomers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you are s of redemp now the day of redemption it says is the day that book is open. [Applause] Then you are redeemed out of the book &gt;&gt; as he said to Daniel. &gt;&gt; Close the book until the end time and your people shall be saved. &gt;&gt; Everybody that shall be found written. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I close? I said in Malawi, sorry for keeping you long. Then they said, "No, here we've got eternal life." &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So scared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They wanted me to preach for the rest of &gt;&gt; Okay. The reason I went west, you know, we have west and east and west. So says east and west has come together &gt;&gt; because it's the eastern people and the western people that is the Jews and the the gentiles. Now he went west in order to connect with this angel's message to come back here to reveal it to the church because I can read some scriptures places here where it says when he left the intercessory box and then h when the intercessory box is over the church ages have done finished up he come in this age. He he takes the book of seals, the book of seals or a book sealed with seven seals, break them and shows the &gt;&gt; them h to pardon me, pardon me. And shows them look at the end of the age now. &gt;&gt; He shows them he shows them to the seventh angel because it was the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. was the seventh man. He erected the the pyramid but the one who interpreted it was brother. &gt;&gt; It will be silent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wow. Yeah. Now h I connected with the message of this angel now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because he couldn't interpret. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So now he must connect with the angel that angel in order to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; And reveal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he says with this angel's message to come back here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To reveal it to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember I said the next thing things that will happen will be here at the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not to the world. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But they are going to one place. Yes, &gt;&gt; Elijah was sent to pick up Elishah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But there were some churches built around that. &gt;&gt; But he came for Elijah. &gt;&gt; You know, you you plant your weed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There will be some churches around And the name is almost the same. &gt;&gt; If you ask them who are we? So if you didn't listen [Applause] [Music] when when he goes to water is to water the wheat. But now because they are now they build around the &gt;&gt; so they also receive &gt;&gt; water &gt;&gt; but they think they will outshine the wind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the next thing comes to [Music]
