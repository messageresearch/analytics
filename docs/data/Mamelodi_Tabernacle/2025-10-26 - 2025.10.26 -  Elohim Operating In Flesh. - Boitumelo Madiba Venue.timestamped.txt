[17:04] Shall we bow our heads?
[17:08] Gracious Lord, heavenly father,
[17:13] the Bible says before you there was no
[17:16] God
[17:19] and after you there will be no God.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; You are that big fountain spirit
[17:29] &gt;&gt; that father condescended itself gracious
[17:32] Lord
[17:34] &gt;&gt; and became a man.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the logos.
[17:40] We like to thank you gracious heavenly
[17:42] father
[17:44] that the man which is the logos, the
[17:46] word of God came and dwell amongst us.
[17:52] Just want to thank you gracious heavenly
[17:54] father
[17:56] that Lord you have chosen
[17:59] yourself a house
[18:01] &gt;&gt; and the house which is the heart of a
[18:04] man.
[18:06] Just want to thank you gracious Lord
[18:08] that
[18:10] your dead throne it is in the man.
[18:14] We are living in the time
[18:17] whereby father things are happening
[18:22] but lord we don't look at the things
[18:24] that are happening
[18:26] but father we hear what he says in our
[18:29] hearts
[18:32] &gt;&gt; because father the one who is on our
[18:34] hearts
[18:36] he's the logos
[18:38] &gt;&gt; he's Christ he's the word
[18:41] &gt;&gt; he has given us the word of this power
[18:45] &gt;&gt; so that in times like this we must in
[18:48] panic
[18:49] &gt;&gt; but we must trust him as the word
[18:53] &gt;&gt; because the word came and dwell amongst
[18:56] us.
[18:59] We just want to thank you gracious Lord
[19:01] that we are the bride of the most high
[19:04] God
[19:06] and there's nothing that will ever
[19:08] happen to your bride.
[19:12] Whoever touches your bride, he touches
[19:14] father the eye
[19:17] of the Lord. Because gracious heavenly
[19:19] father, greater is he that is within the
[19:23] bride than the one who is in this world.
[19:28] This morning, Father, we just want to
[19:30] say search our hearts
[19:34] &gt;&gt; and see whether, father, our hearts are
[19:37] ready for your coming.
[19:40] The devil has placed so many things in
[19:43] the heart
[19:45] and he is trying to take the word out of
[19:48] the heart.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; But gracious Lord, we just want to thank
[19:53] you
[19:54] &gt;&gt; that those who believe in the message of
[19:57] the seven seal,
[20:00] &gt;&gt; they are the one gracious heavenly
[20:02] father that will see the Lord soon and
[20:05] very soon.
[20:08] We stand against any principality of
[20:11] darkness.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; We stand against Satan himself.
[20:17] We stand against gracious heavenly
[20:19] father.
[20:20] All the witches and wizards they hear me
[20:24] in the name of Jesus
[20:26] &gt;&gt; that whatever that you are trying to do
[20:29] it will never succeed
[20:31] [Applause]
[20:32] because this is the house of the Lord.
[20:37] You can mix
[20:39] things to other people, but you'll never
[20:42] mix to the bride of the Lord
[20:46] because she knows that thus says the
[20:48] Lord. She's got a word and she knows who
[20:53] is the pastor
[20:56] and the pastor gracious heavenly father,
[20:58] he's the one who will take us through.
[21:01] Gracious Lord, when we cross over,
[21:06] gracious heavenly father, he will show
[21:08] us through
[21:10] because Lord, he is our shepherd.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; We pray for our shepherd this morning.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Our pastor is God.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; We came from different places. Lord,
[21:25] &gt;&gt; we were lost, but he prayed for us.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; And today we are gathered here. Gracious
[21:31] Lord because father he did his work.
[21:35] Thank you Lord. Thank you father. We are
[21:39] running short of words
[21:42] this morning we pray.
[21:44] Search our hearts.
[21:46] Whatever which is not of God let it go
[21:48] away.
[21:50] Whatever is not planted by God let it go
[21:53] away.
[21:55] Whatever has been planted by the devil
[21:57] we uproot it now in the name of Jesus.
[22:00] and let it go away.
[22:02] Thank you, heavenly father. We pray for
[22:06] the word of God this morning. The man of
[22:10] God that we have placed
[22:12] behind the pullpit. We pray for him
[22:14] Lord.
[22:16] That Lord is going to bring the heart of
[22:18] God to the bride.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; We also pray father for our brother was
[22:23] leading us with songs. We also pray
[22:26] father for those who seek you, they will
[22:28] find you. for those who are sick Lord
[22:31] they'll be healed because we are in the
[22:34] house of solution.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; We pray for the elders. We pray for the
[22:39] deacons. We pray father for the
[22:40] trustees. We pray father for each and
[22:43] everyone who is in the position that
[22:46] father let him work in that pos position
[22:50] faithfully so because tomorrow is going
[22:53] to be asked about that position.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you heavenly father. We like to
[22:57] thank you and we love you so much. There
[23:00] is no other God to whom we can love
[23:01] beside thee. We give all the glory and
[23:04] honor in the name of our Lord and Savior
[23:07] Jesus Christ. Amen.

[1:02:16] Hallelujah.

[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; So the last thing that I need to
[1:03:36] announce,
[1:03:38] there's a request.
[1:03:42] uh they are requesting that when we come
[1:03:44] into the tabernacle
[1:03:48] we say it is a quiet time according to
[1:03:51] order.
[1:03:55] So now you will find that there are
[1:03:58] brethren
[1:04:01] who will be disturbing other brethren
[1:04:06] while they are busy focusing
[1:04:10] reading their Bible
[1:04:12] but they want to have some talks or
[1:04:16] something like that.
[1:04:19] So we are being requested
[1:04:22] that led us by all means Respect
[1:04:27] God
[1:04:29] in the quiet time.
[1:04:31] Whenever there's somebody that you need,
[1:04:35] just speak to him or her and go out of
[1:04:38] the tabernacle.
[1:04:42] And then after that, you come quietly
[1:04:43] also.
[1:04:46] God bless you all.
[1:04:49] Amen. Amen. Now, we are going to a very
[1:04:52] important time.
[1:04:55] the time of the preaching of the word.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; So this morning,
[1:05:05] our pastor
[1:05:07] has requested
[1:05:09] and confirm
[1:05:12] that our precious pastor, Pastor Miva
[1:05:17] will be behind the pullpit this morning.

[1:08:16] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:08:21] How many are happy to be back in church
[1:08:23] this morning?
[1:08:27] I'm happy to be here.
[1:08:30] I say I'm happy to be here. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:33] Amen.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; So
[1:08:36] for everything there is a time and a
[1:08:38] season.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And the pastor when he gave me a call
[1:08:45] that I must come and minister here
[1:08:51] I realized that, okay, it's time.
[1:08:57] And
[1:08:59] last night, he called again to confirm
[1:09:01] that I'm coming.
[1:09:06] And I said, there's no way that you can
[1:09:09] disappoint an elder.
[1:09:15] Amen. Amen. I'm not a visitor here made
[1:09:18] home.
[1:09:20] Amen. I
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; I can welcome visitors.

[1:09:25] [Applause]
[1:09:26] Amen.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; So, we appreciate our pastor.
[1:09:32] Maybe you just take your seats for a few
[1:09:34] minutes.
[1:09:40] We special greetings to the elders
[1:09:45] and special greetings to the pastor back
[1:09:47] at home.
[1:09:51] I'll be seeing him after church.
[1:09:55] I said, "I must tell you that next week
[1:10:00] or the week after
[1:10:04] either of the two,
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; he will be here physically in church."
[1:10:11] [Applause]
[1:10:13] How many love the pastor? Amen.
[1:10:17] Amen. We certainly appreciate him.
[1:10:23] Amen. Amen.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; I just want be to make a few remarks
[1:10:28] before I preach.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; In the book of Proverbs
[1:10:37] 22 is the chapter 22
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; verse 28.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Verse 28.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; If the brothers bring it up,
[1:10:51] I want all of us to see it.
[1:10:57] Okay.
[1:10:59] It says, "Remove not the ancient
[1:11:02] landmark
[1:11:06] which thy fathers have said."
[1:11:11] And maybe if I say to this church,
[1:11:16] remove not the landmark
[1:11:22] which you which your pastor has said.
[1:11:28] Amen.
[1:11:30] How many believe the pastors left
[1:11:32] landmarks?
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Remove not those landmarks.
[1:11:43] Let's go to Jeremiah 6.
[1:11:48] Jeremiah 6 verse 16.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Verse 16.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; It says, "Thus says the Lord,
[1:11:56] Stand ye in the ways
[1:12:00] and see
[1:12:02] and ask for the old paths,
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; not new path.
[1:12:10] Ask for the old path,
[1:12:14] timeested paths.
[1:12:20] Where is the good way?
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:25] and walk therein
[1:12:28] and he shall find rest for your soul.
[1:12:34] How many believe we must find to the old
[1:12:35] ways
[1:12:41] ancient landmarks?
[1:12:44] Now
[1:12:46] I'm a I'm a student of this ministry.
[1:12:52] Now I'm a graduate of it.
[1:12:56] Amen. Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; There are few things that we have
[1:12:59] learned from our elder.
[1:13:06] One point that we have learned is
[1:13:07] selflessness.
[1:13:12] He existed his entire life and he gave
[1:13:16] it all his to you as a church.
[1:13:25] Even now, he's still carrying you on his
[1:13:27] burdens.
[1:13:31] He's carrying your burdens on his
[1:13:33] shoulders.
[1:13:37] He has done so much for this ministry
[1:13:42] and all we have seen is nothing but
[1:13:45] selflessness.
[1:13:49] I I'm thinking of orphans that were
[1:13:52] taken to schools by this church.
[1:13:59] I'm thinking of houses that were built
[1:14:01] for the widows in this church.
[1:14:09] One thing that I've known over the
[1:14:10] years,
[1:14:13] no poor person ever misses the
[1:14:16] conference because they don't have money
[1:14:17] in this church.
[1:14:31] It reflects the selflessness of his
[1:14:33] character.
[1:14:37] Another thing that I learned from him,
[1:14:41] battles are not fought for money.
[1:14:46] The battles are fought for principles.
[1:14:53] He trained us to be in the ministry, not
[1:14:55] for money.
[1:15:00] But our focus is the souls.
[1:15:05] How many believe that this is a good
[1:15:06] principle?
[1:15:11] He pointed to the landmarks that have
[1:15:13] been left by our prophet.
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:18] The seven seal is a landmark.
[1:15:24] Third pool is a landmark.
[1:15:27] The revelation of the son of man is a
[1:15:29] landmark.
[1:15:31] All those subjects those are the
[1:15:33] landmarks.
[1:15:36] So I stand behind this pullpit with
[1:15:38] respect and reverence to him as an
[1:15:40] elder.
[1:15:47] And I think we can appreciate him and
[1:15:49] his wife and the family.
[1:15:53] [Applause]
[1:15:58] He has never shamed us.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; This has been a scandal scandalless
[1:16:06] free ministry.
[1:16:10] Amen. Amen. Over 50 years.
[1:16:14] Amen. You know some ministries within 3
[1:16:18] years.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Some ministries within 3 years.
[1:16:26] But 50 years later
[1:16:29] said to pastor,
[1:16:33] "We respect you.
[1:16:35] We appreciate his sacrifice.
[1:16:39] We appreciate his dedication to the body
[1:16:41] of Christ.
[1:16:45] All the journeys that he has taken.
[1:16:51] We are the beneficiaries of these labors
[1:16:53] of love.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; I think we can give him a round of
[1:16:56] applause.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; So we'll move to the dedication
[1:17:10] dedications.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Uh the newcomers if somebody if you ask
[1:17:14] and say who's that man who say that is a
[1:17:16] son at home.
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:24] Amen. Amen. I'm home. Amen.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; So, I'll ask the Matipa family
[1:17:39] just to come as we say uh sing that song
[1:17:43] for little babies.
[1:17:48] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fine.
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Who sees?
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Who sees?
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Who sees? Who sees
[1:18:21] who sees the ses?
[1:18:24] [Music]
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; As we turn to the book of St. Mark
[1:18:48] the 10th chapter
[1:18:50] 13th verse.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; And they brought young children to him
[1:18:57] that he should touch them. And his
[1:19:00] disciples rebuked those that brought
[1:19:02] them.
[1:19:05] But when Jesus saw it,
[1:19:08] he was much displeased
[1:19:11] and said unto them, "Suffer the little
[1:19:14] children to come unto me,
[1:19:17] and forbid them not, for of such
[1:19:22] is the kingdom of God.
[1:19:24] Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall
[1:19:28] not receive the kingdom of God
[1:19:32] as a little child, he shall not enter
[1:19:35] there.
[1:19:36] And he took them up in his arms,
[1:19:42] put his hands upon them,
[1:19:45] and blessed them. And that's exactly
[1:19:47] what we can do.
[1:19:50] Amen. God bless you, Sister Ch.
[1:19:54] Oh, brother.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Brother is now a grandfather.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:07] They put
[1:20:09] like this.
[1:20:11] What's the name?
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our gracious heavenly father.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the children are the
[1:20:27] heritage of the Lord.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we are standing here this
[1:20:31] morning as an acknowledgment that life
[1:20:33] comes from you.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; And you and you alone can preserve life.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here as a minister of the
[1:20:41] gospel to say a prayer over the life of
[1:20:43] this child.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't know what the journey of
[1:20:46] life holds,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; but may it always be remembered that
[1:20:50] there was a minister of the gospel.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; That said a prayer over the life of this
[1:20:55] child.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; May the same influence that the parents
[1:20:58] have come under, may this child come
[1:21:01] under the same influence.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; That later on when this child cometh of
[1:21:06] age, he she as well must say indeed I'm
[1:21:10] worshiping the God of my parents.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord we appreciate you as we
[1:21:15] commit this life to you for the
[1:21:18] preservation in the name of Jesus
[1:21:20] Christ. Amen.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Congratulations.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go to the reading of
[1:21:34] the way as we stand to our feet. God
[1:21:37] bless you musicians.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We're going to turn to the
[1:21:43] book of John 1 verse one.
[1:21:49] Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; It reads in this manner.
[1:22:02] I'll give those that are looking to find
[1:22:04] it.
[1:22:08] In the beginning was the word
[1:22:11] and the word was with God
[1:22:15] and the word was God.
[1:22:19] The same was in the beginning with God.
[1:22:23] All things were made by him
[1:22:27] and without him was not anything made
[1:22:30] that was made.
[1:22:34] Amen. Amen. Verse 14. Verse 14.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh
[1:22:41] and dwelt among us.
[1:22:44] And we beheld his glory,
[1:22:47] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:22:49] father,
[1:22:57] full of grace and truth.
[1:23:00] as we bow our heads.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Our gracious heavenly father,
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; we appreciate you this morning.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, we first and foremost want to
[1:23:13] thank you.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; For our pastor.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; You have strengthened him.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; You fought so many of his battles.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is why this morning
[1:23:27] we can say Jehovah
[1:23:31] is a mighty warrior.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; He's great in battle.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; You have never lost even one battle even
[1:23:40] one time.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; You are our five-star general.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And that is why
[1:23:50] if you are on our side, who can be
[1:23:52] against us?
[1:23:54] No principality,
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; no demonic power,
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; nothing can stand before us.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "Greater is he that
[1:24:05] is in you
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; than the one that is out there in the
[1:24:08] world."
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; And that is why we want to appreciate
[1:24:12] you this morning. Amen.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here behind the holy desk
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; to speak to speak to the bloodboard
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; It comes with such a responsibility
[1:24:28] and be gracious to me as you become
[1:24:31] gracious to them.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, may it be the operation of the
[1:24:36] Holy Spirit that through the preaching
[1:24:38] of the word, those that are sick, may
[1:24:40] they be healed. Those that are bound,
[1:24:43] may they be set free.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz Lord, we've got a commission that
[1:24:48] whatever we bind here on earth
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; shall be bound in heaven.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; And whatever we set free here on earth
[1:24:55] shall be set free in heaven.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; And right now under the authority of the
[1:25:00] word of God.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; We bind every demon
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; May God come and minister to the hearts
[1:25:08] of your people. All these things, dear
[1:25:11] God, we ask them believing in the most
[1:25:13] gracious name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:25:17] Amen.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you take the comfort of
[1:25:20] your seat.
[1:25:23] Amen.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; I must say you sing very well as a
[1:25:27] church.
[1:25:32] Amen.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenam says when we get onto the
[1:25:35] other side,
[1:25:39] We will sing all songs of Zion.
[1:25:45] And it says we will sing for 10 10,000
[1:25:48] years.
[1:25:52] And it will feel like it will feel like
[1:25:54] just a song service.
[1:25:58] I don't know how many are looking
[1:25:59] forward to that time
[1:26:03] where the past battles are behind us.
[1:26:07] where sickness will never be there
[1:26:09] anymore.
[1:26:11] No, no old age there.
[1:26:15] We will be in the brilliancy of our
[1:26:17] youth
[1:26:20] and we will say well done my brother.
[1:26:23] Well done my sister. We made it against
[1:26:27] all odds we have.
[1:26:30] I don't know how many are looking
[1:26:31] forward.
[1:26:33] Whatever you do, don't remain behind.
[1:26:38] make sure that you make it to the other
[1:26:39] side.
[1:26:42] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; This morning I want to speak on Elohim
[1:26:46] operating in flesh.
[1:26:52] Amen.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:55] Genesis 1 verse one verse one
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Moses he speaks there
[1:27:04] and wrote and said in the beginning
[1:27:07] God created the heaven and the earth
[1:27:13] and maybe the people that might have
[1:27:15] read this during the time of Moses
[1:27:20] they might have thought maybe Moses must
[1:27:22] have hit the climax next.
[1:27:28] But later on, John the Eagle,
[1:27:32] he comes, he goes beyond the beginning
[1:27:35] of Moses.
[1:27:38] He tells the people that there was the
[1:27:40] another beginning
[1:27:44] before this beginning.
[1:27:46] Then he says, "In the beginning was the
[1:27:48] way
[1:27:50] and the way it was with God
[1:27:53] and the way it was God."
[1:27:56] And people thought John must have hit a
[1:27:58] climax.
[1:28:02] But in the end time,
[1:28:04] there came a man.
[1:28:06] He went beyond the beginning of Moses.
[1:28:11] He went beyond the beginning of John.
[1:28:15] And he said let us go back at the back
[1:28:17] part of the mind of God.
[1:28:21] Let us go back to the time before God
[1:28:24] became God.
[1:28:29] Then we realize that now we are going to
[1:28:31] a climax.
[1:28:34] Then it says in Christ is the mystery of
[1:28:36] God revealed
[1:28:38] 102.
[1:28:40] He says now God's secret mystery
[1:28:45] he had before the world began
[1:28:49] now back at the back part of God's mind.
[1:28:54] When we say something is at the back
[1:28:55] part of your mind
[1:28:58] it means it's a very important.
[1:29:02] Hallelujah. Amen. The back part of the
[1:29:04] mind of a person is a very important
[1:29:06] area.
[1:29:10] THE BACK part of the mind is where
[1:29:12] thoughts are hidden.
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:16] Now here is a man. He is going back at
[1:29:18] the back part of the mind of God.
[1:29:22] What what is he trying to locate?
[1:29:26] He wants to interact with God's
[1:29:27] thoughts.
[1:29:31] This is not for CHURCH MEMBERS.
[1:29:34] This is before the denomination.
[1:29:36] [Applause]
[1:29:38] Are you still with me? This is even
[1:29:40] before the devil was there.
[1:29:44] This is before demons WERE THERE.
[1:29:48] This is before God was God.
[1:29:51] THIS is when he was the self-existing
[1:29:53] one.
[1:29:56] There was no planet. There was nothing.
[1:29:59] BUT here is a man. He's locating God's
[1:30:02] thought.
[1:30:06] Now what does he find at the back part
[1:30:09] of the mind of God? He finds the bride.
[1:30:13] He finds THE ELECT.
[1:30:16] HE finds the PREDESTINATED
[1:30:20] this morning. We we had much better tell
[1:30:22] Satan.
[1:30:23] We had much better tell Satan.
[1:30:27] I'm not a believer FROM HERE.
[1:30:30] I'm not a believer because OF WHAT'S
[1:30:32] HAPPENING HERE.
[1:30:34] THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS HAPPENING that
[1:30:36] will change who I am.
[1:30:41] I was a believer BEFORE MY POVERTY.
[1:30:45] I was a believer BEFORE MY SICKNESS. I
[1:30:49] WAS A BELIEVER BEFORE THIS BODY. I WAS A
[1:30:53] BELIEVER BEFORE SATAN WAS THERE. I WAS A
[1:30:57] BELIEVER BEFORE DEMONS WERE THERE. SO
[1:31:01] I'M A BELIEVER FROM ETERNITY.
[1:31:04] AND I WILL BELIEVE GOD HERE AND I AM
[1:31:08] GOING BACK TO ETERNITY.
[1:31:10] AND THIS MORNING I'M SPEAKING TO THE
[1:31:12] PEOPLE
[1:31:14] THAT ARE UNSTOPPABLE.
[1:31:16] HATRED CANNOT STOP THEM.
[1:31:19] DECEPTION CANNOT STOP THEM. SATAN CANNOT
[1:31:22] STOP THEM. THESE PEOPLE ARE HEAVEN
[1:31:25] BOUND.
[1:31:27] THEY COME from God AND THEY'RE GOING
[1:31:28] BACK TO GOD.
[1:31:31] AND THIS MORNING I'M GLAD TO SAY I can
[1:31:32] say I'm glad I can say I'm one of them.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Believers don't be distracted by what is
[1:31:40] happening in time space.
[1:31:44] When Job was distracted by what was
[1:31:46] happening in in the space of time,
[1:31:51] GOD COMES TO JOB AND SAY JOB STAND UP
[1:31:55] AND SPEAK LIKE A MAN. WHERE WERE YOU
[1:31:59] WHEN THE MORNING START SUN?
[1:32:02] WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE SONS OF GOD
[1:32:04] SEARCHED FOR JOY? THIS MORNING, I DON'T
[1:32:07] KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, BUT I'VE
[1:32:09] GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU. WHERE WERE YOU
[1:32:13] WHEN THE MONARCH SANG?
[1:32:15] WHERE WERE YOU when the sons OF GOD
[1:32:18] SHOUTED FOR JOB? THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE
[1:32:21] THAT CAN GIVE AN ANSWER.
[1:32:24] THEY CAN SAY BROTHER
[1:32:26] I WAS THERE AND THIS MAN I WANT TO SAY I
[1:32:30] WAS THERE
[1:32:33] I hope we are together
[1:32:38] at the back part of the mind of God
[1:32:42] you know I've realized
[1:32:44] uh you know we don't want to do
[1:32:48] mlas
[1:32:51] that I'm I'm your brother because it's
[1:32:53] ml
[1:32:56] I'm a sister because it's my blood.
[1:32:59] Let me tell you something. Some of us
[1:33:03] who are brothers
[1:33:05] and sisters in the mind of God. Amen.
[1:33:10] Some of us who are your pastors
[1:33:14] but your pastors in the mind of God. OUR
[1:33:18] PROPHET WAS OUR PROPHET AS A back part
[1:33:22] of the man. Jeremiah Jeremiah didn't
[1:33:25] become a prophet here. HE WAS A PROPHET
[1:33:29] BEFORE HE WAS FORMED IN HIS MOTHER'S
[1:33:32] BATHING. AND THIS MORNING, some of you,
[1:33:36] YOU WERE BELIEVERS BEFORE YOU WERE
[1:33:39] FORMED IN YOUR MOTHER'S BATHING.
[1:33:43] So don't be intimidated by Satan.
[1:33:47] [Applause]
[1:33:50] Then the prophet says,
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; "Now God's secret mystery
[1:33:57] he had before the world began
[1:34:01] now back at the back part of God's mind.
[1:34:05] Hey, I'm I'm begging to move from this.
[1:34:10] I don't know whether people they have
[1:34:12] experienced what we call a djà vu
[1:34:17] is when you are maybe you're sitting
[1:34:19] with people
[1:34:22] maybe you are talking and you feel like
[1:34:24] this is not happening for the first time
[1:34:27] it's like we've been here before
[1:34:29] how many HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED THAT
[1:34:32] every time when I hear the prophet's
[1:34:33] VOICE
[1:34:37] when he say good evening friends I say
[1:34:40] this is NOT THE FIRST TIME
[1:34:43] I hear this voice. I've se I've heard
[1:34:46] this voice before. Then I realized that
[1:34:48] I didn't hear this voice here.
[1:34:51] I'm hearing it FOR THE SECOND TIME. THE
[1:34:54] FIRST time it was in the mind of God
[1:34:57] now. I'm hearing it here. But because I
[1:35:00] believed in that voice there,
[1:35:03] THEN I WILL BELIEVE in that voice here.
[1:35:06] Amen.
[1:35:07] He said there was something that he was
[1:35:09] trying
[1:35:12] and was going to achieve
[1:35:16] and he had a motive in doing it
[1:35:20] in in order to let himself be expressed
[1:35:24] because first there wasn't even a moon.
[1:35:29] There was not even a star. There was not
[1:35:32] even an atom.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Let's give the brothers to help us. We
[1:35:36] going to preach.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; The devil will not stop us.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; We going to preach.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Then it says first there wasn't even a
[1:35:50] moon.
[1:35:54] Hallelujah.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Or anything.
[1:36:01] He was God. Then he turns. It says, "But
[1:36:04] he exactly wasn't God at that time."
[1:36:09] Because God is an object of worship.
[1:36:14] There wasn't nothing to WORSHIP HIM.
[1:36:17] That's why we call him Elohim.
[1:36:21] Selexisting God.
[1:36:24] Now, now the prophet says, and this is
[1:36:27] where you are going to understand when
[1:36:29] the prophet says, "We I'm glad that when
[1:36:32] I die, I'm not going to become an
[1:36:33] angel."
[1:36:38] Because an angel is a servant
[1:36:41] and a servant is replaceable.
[1:36:45] But a son and a daughter,
[1:36:48] even if they can upset you, you can
[1:36:51] never replace your son.
[1:36:53] You can never replace your daughter.
[1:36:56] That's why when the when the oneird of
[1:36:58] angels
[1:37:01] never kept their estate,
[1:37:04] THEY WERE kicked out of heaven
[1:37:06] and they remain NO PLACE FOR THEM.
[1:37:09] SO THAT MEANS THEY ARE NOT REDEEMABLE.
[1:37:12] Satan is not redeemable.
[1:37:14] Demons are not redeemable.
[1:37:17] And God abolished THEIR ESTATE.
[1:37:20] But when a son fell,
[1:37:23] I can't stay here.
[1:37:26] I must follow my son.
[1:37:28] I must go INTO TIME.
[1:37:31] I MUST become come in a sinful form
[1:37:36] because without the son
[1:37:38] I'm not complete
[1:37:41] without the daughter. I'M NOT COMPLETE.
[1:37:45] HEAVEN IS NOT complete without you.
[1:37:49] Now
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; the prophet say in the unveiling of God
[1:37:54] unveiling of God
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; he says this is a part of his way
[1:37:59] this is the way that he manifest himself
[1:38:01] to us
[1:38:05] manifest the eternal
[1:38:08] uh no problem we'll give him we've got
[1:38:11] time
[1:38:12] amen And
[1:38:22] that's fine.
[1:38:26] How many appreciate the brother for
[1:38:28] helping us?
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:31] [Applause]
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; This is a he says this is a part of his
[1:38:37] way.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; This is the way that he manifest himself
[1:38:41] to us.
[1:38:44] manifest the eternal way
[1:38:48] God Jehovah made flesh
[1:38:52] like St. John 1.
[1:38:55] In the beginning was the way and the
[1:38:58] weight was with God. In the beginning
[1:39:00] was Elohim
[1:39:02] and Elohim became the way
[1:39:06] and that weight was Elohim
[1:39:09] and the weight was made Elohim.
[1:39:12] Then the prophecy is the same thing
[1:39:16] just unfolding.
[1:39:19] Then he carries on. He says like the
[1:39:20] attribute.
[1:39:23] He says see it is in God
[1:39:27] and attribute is your thought.
[1:39:31] God in the beginning
[1:39:33] the eternal he wasn't even God.
[1:39:38] He was the eternal.
[1:39:40] He wasn't even God. God is an object of
[1:39:43] worship
[1:39:45] or something. He wasn't even that. He
[1:39:49] was Elohim, the eternal. But in him was
[1:39:54] thoughts. He wanted to become material.
[1:40:01] He was not satisfied just to be a
[1:40:02] spirit.
[1:40:05] He wanted to BECOME MATERIAL.
[1:40:09] WHAT DID HE DO? Then he spoke the word
[1:40:12] and that word was materialized.
[1:40:15] And the prophet said that's THE WHOLE
[1:40:16] PICTURE
[1:40:18] FROM GENESIS to Revelation.
[1:40:21] There's nothing wrong. It's Elohim
[1:40:24] materializing
[1:40:26] so that he can be touched.
[1:40:29] And this MORNING I SAY ELOHIM
[1:40:32] can be touched.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? This is this
[1:40:38] algebra is not for Pentecostals.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; You know there are denominations
[1:40:45] they appreciate that we say our father
[1:40:47] thou art in HEAVEN
[1:40:50] that is distant is day in heaven.
[1:40:54] But when we come in into into the
[1:40:57] message,
[1:40:59] we realize THAT SAME GOD
[1:41:02] can can coesend
[1:41:04] and he can pour himself into a human
[1:41:07] form
[1:41:09] and he can wear his suits and he can
[1:41:12] walk among us. He did it during the time
[1:41:15] of of of Jesus. He walked amongst them.
[1:41:19] And in our time, we have a man that
[1:41:22] came.
[1:41:23] HE TURNED HIS back and said there is a
[1:41:26] woman at the bed she's not from here
[1:41:30] she's from such and such place and this
[1:41:33] woman is suffering from SUCH AND SUCH IS
[1:41:36] AND THIS MAN SAID that woman CONTACTED
[1:41:40] GOD.
[1:41:42] NOW MY QUESTION IS THAT GOD WAS NOT IN
[1:41:44] HEAVEN
[1:41:46] BUT THAT God he took A HUMAN FORM
[1:41:50] AND THIS IS WHAT THE DEVIL HATES.
[1:41:53] WHEN GOD TAKES A HUMAN FORM
[1:41:56] ANYTIME YOU see God taking a HUMAN FORM,
[1:42:00] YOU MUST know that there's going to be a
[1:42:01] body change.
[1:42:05] DURING THE TIME OF ABRAHAM WHEN HE TOOK
[1:42:07] A BODY FORM
[1:42:09] ABRAHAM AND SARAH THEY BECAME YOUNG
[1:42:12] AGAIN DURING THE TIME OF JESUS WHEN HE
[1:42:15] TOOK A HUMAN FORM THERE WERE THE GRAVES
[1:42:18] OPEN IN OUR TIME HE HAS TAKEN A HUMAN
[1:42:22] FORM AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST GOD IN HEAVEN
[1:42:26] BUT ELOHIM CAN BE TOUCHED ELOHIM YOU CAN
[1:42:31] SHAKE HIS HAND HOW CAN YOU SHAKE HIS
[1:42:34] ELOHIM TODAY HE'S GOT A NEW VEIL.
[1:42:39] JESUS WAS A VEIL.
[1:42:41] BUT TODAY GOD HAS GOT A VEIL. HOW MANY
[1:42:44] BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS GOT A VEIL?
[1:42:48] AT THAT DAY YOU SHALL KNOW. YOU SHALL
[1:42:51] KNOW. YOU SHALL KNOW. AT THAT DAY WHICH
[1:42:55] DAY THIS DAY YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM IN
[1:42:59] THE FATHER. THAT WAS ANOTHER FOUR. AND
[1:43:03] THE FATHER IN ME. THAT'S ANOTHER FALL.
[1:43:06] AND I IN YOU, THAT'S ANOTHER FALL. AND
[1:43:10] TODAY WE ARE ON THE THIRD ONE.
[1:43:13] I IN YOU.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ME PREACHING TO YOU. IT'S I IN
[1:43:19] YOU. I NOT YOU RECEIVING THE MESSAGE.
[1:43:22] IT'S I IN YOU.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; JEHOVAH
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; OF THE OLD TESTAMENT IS HERE NOW IN THIS
[1:43:29] DAY.
[1:43:31] HE'S WALKING THE STREETS OF MI.
[1:43:37] AMEN.
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; I can shake the hand of God today.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:46] HOW DO I DO THAT? GREATER IS HE THAT IS
[1:43:49] IN HIM.
[1:43:50] GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME.
[1:43:54] AMEN.
[1:43:55] [Applause]
[1:43:58] Are you still with me?
[1:44:02] The Patmos vision vision
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; brother says 1332.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; He said the greatest of all revelation
[1:44:13] the climax
[1:44:17] the high point
[1:44:20] is the deity
[1:44:22] supreme deity of our lord Jesus Christ.
[1:44:27] Why say this is the greatest?
[1:44:30] IT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOU see
[1:44:33] what he has done in Jesus,
[1:44:36] then you will know
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; what he will do in you.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brendam, in your
[1:44:50] message, spiritual food in juice season,
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; he says if he comes today looking like a
[1:44:57] hoffman,
[1:45:00] and having nail wounds.
[1:45:04] Brother says, "I won't accept him."
[1:45:07] He says, "Because it's not the season
[1:45:09] for that body."
[1:45:13] But he says, "If he comes in the form of
[1:45:15] my brother
[1:45:18] and the form of my sister, then I will
[1:45:21] accept him because it is the I in YOU
[1:45:24] SEASON.
[1:45:28] NOW we can tell the world. When they say
[1:45:31] show us the father, we can say we have
[1:45:33] been with you THIS LONG.
[1:45:36] WHAT DO you mean when you say show US
[1:45:38] THE FATHER?
[1:45:40] WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN US, you have seen the
[1:45:42] father. But you know why they cannot see
[1:45:44] the father?
[1:45:47] They must go beyond the veil.
[1:45:50] Are you still with me? Amen. The
[1:45:53] Samaritan woman.
[1:45:56] met Elohim
[1:45:59] in flesh.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; The prophet says
[1:46:04] in the message the future home,
[1:46:07] you know, God works in a paradoxical
[1:46:09] manner.
[1:46:13] Here is a Samaritan woman.
[1:46:17] Five husbands have gone by.
[1:46:22] Now staying with the sixth one.
[1:46:25] even ashamed to come to the well
[1:46:30] towards the evening time.
[1:46:33] She chose the midday
[1:46:35] where it was hot
[1:46:38] because she was a social outcast.
[1:46:44] They rejected her.
[1:46:47] Then she walked alone
[1:46:49] and went to the well. But she did not
[1:46:52] know
[1:46:54] that that day it was a different day.
[1:46:58] It was a divine appointment.
[1:47:02] The Bible says Jesus had to go by the
[1:47:05] way of Samaria.
[1:47:08] You know they used to bypass Samaria,
[1:47:12] go via Jericho and go to Galedia and
[1:47:15] come back to Judea
[1:47:17] because they avoided the Samaritans.
[1:47:21] They avoided the Samaritans. They didn't
[1:47:23] want to go through Samaria.
[1:47:25] But when God was in flesh,
[1:47:28] he said, "I'm going to break the
[1:47:30] protocol.
[1:47:32] I'm not going to bypass Samaria.
[1:47:35] I'm going to go via Samaria." What was
[1:47:38] happening in Samaria? There was a seed.
[1:47:42] There was a daughter of God.
[1:47:44] But this daughter of God, she had
[1:47:46] spiritual amnesia.
[1:47:49] She had forgotten who she is.
[1:47:52] She became a prostitute.
[1:47:55] BUT THEN JESUS went by Samaria.
[1:47:58] And when they came there, they met. And
[1:48:01] when they met, then Jesus says to the
[1:48:03] Samaritan woman, give me water to drink.
[1:48:06] And the Samaritan woman say, "It is not
[1:48:09] customary
[1:48:11] that we Jews should have this
[1:48:13] conversation with you. No, we are the
[1:48:17] Samaritan. And then he say only if you
[1:48:19] knew the gift of God and the one that is
[1:48:23] speaking to you will be the one asking
[1:48:26] me for WATER BECAUSE THE WATER that I'll
[1:48:28] give you will QUENCH YOUR THIRST
[1:48:32] ETERNALLY. NOW WHEN THEY WERE SPEAKING
[1:48:36] THE WOMAN SAID GIVE ME the water.
[1:48:38] And then the Jesus says go and get your
[1:48:41] husband and say I have none. I've had
[1:48:44] five. Jesus says you have had five. the
[1:48:48] one that you're with is not even yours.
[1:48:51] Right there, there was a there was a
[1:48:53] there was a realization
[1:48:56] that no, no, no, no, no. I've met men
[1:48:59] before, but this IS A SPECIAL KIND.
[1:49:03] THIS ONE WENT BEYOND MY BODY.
[1:49:06] This one WENT BEYOND MY SPIRIT.
[1:49:08] THIS ONE CAME IN CONTACT
[1:49:11] WITH THE CHIN OF GOD IN ME.
[1:49:14] THEN SHE REALIZED THAT WE KNOW THAT WHEN
[1:49:18] MESSIAH COMETH, HE WILL TELL US ALL
[1:49:20] THINGS. AND JESUS MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
[1:49:24] AND SAY, "I'M HE WAS NOT IN A CHURCH. IT
[1:49:28] WAS OUTSIDE THE CHURCH." THIS WOMAN WAS
[1:49:31] NOT A PRIEST. SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE. IT
[1:49:35] DOESN'T MATTER WHERE SON OR A DAUGHTER
[1:49:38] OF GOD THEY ARE.
[1:49:40] IT DOESN'T MATTER IN THEIR FALLEN STATE.
[1:49:44] THEY ARE STILL REACHABLE BY GOD.
[1:49:48] Do you remember where God took you from?
[1:49:53] You You were not BORN A BELIEVER.
[1:49:56] YOU WERE OUT THERE, BUT GOD LOCATED YOU.
[1:50:01] HOW DID HE LOCATE YOU? THERE WAS
[1:50:03] SOMETHING IN YOU THAT was waiting for
[1:50:06] the real thing.
[1:50:09] You were like a little igllet.
[1:50:12] You were walking with chickens and you
[1:50:15] WERE SCRATCHING THE SURFACE. BUT YOU
[1:50:17] SAY, "BUT THERE MUST be something
[1:50:18] deeper."
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT AN APPETITE
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; FOR a blood dripping gospel.
[1:50:28] I NEED A GOSPEL THAT COMES FROM
[1:50:31] ETERNITY. AND GOD RAISED A PROPHET AND
[1:50:35] WENT AROUND THE WORLD SEVEN TIMES UNTIL
[1:50:38] THE message came YOUR WAY. AND WHEN THE
[1:50:41] MESSAGE CAME YOUR WAY,
[1:50:45] something moved on the inside of the
[1:50:48] inside.
[1:50:50] YOU HAD SERMONS BEFORE, YOU ATTENDED THE
[1:50:53] CHURCH BEFORE, YOU READ THE BIBLE
[1:50:55] BEFORE. BUT THIS ONE, IT PENETRATED TO
[1:50:59] THE SOUL
[1:51:02] AND YOU SAY, "NOW I MUST LEAVE THE OTHER
[1:51:04] THINGS."
[1:51:07] Because you realize that you're an
[1:51:08] eagle.
[1:51:12] The prophet says
[1:51:14] this little woman,
[1:51:17] had nothing to present,
[1:51:20] she was as filth as dirt as she could
[1:51:22] be.
[1:51:25] BUT NOTICE
[1:51:27] WAY DOWN IN HER,
[1:51:30] she's got representation.
[1:51:32] And then she was looking, brother makes
[1:51:37] a very very important statement.
[1:51:41] He say, "And then she was looking for
[1:51:44] THIS
[1:51:46] to be made flesh."
[1:51:49] I want to check what was he she waiting
[1:51:51] to be flesh.
[1:51:55] Now when he was Elohim,
[1:51:58] the Samaritan woman was there.
[1:52:01] She was an attribute of God. Are you
[1:52:04] still with me here? When he condescended
[1:52:07] and poured himself into the logos,
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; the Samaritan woman had a representation
[1:52:14] THAT WAS A THEOPHONY.
[1:52:16] THEN WHEN THEY CAME INTO FLESH.
[1:52:19] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. Because they had a
[1:52:21] relationship there.
[1:52:24] THEY MET THERE. NOW AT RIVER Jordan at
[1:52:28] the at the Samaritan well.
[1:52:31] IT WAS A MEETING FOR THE SECOND TIME.
[1:52:36] The first MEETING WAS IN HEAVEN, BUT THE
[1:52:38] SECOND MEETING WAS AT THE WELL.
[1:52:41] THAT'S WHY the Samaritan woman
[1:52:44] COULD RECOGNIZE
[1:52:46] THAT THIS MUST BE CHRIST.
[1:52:49] ARE YOU STILL WITH ME HERE? EVEN as he
[1:52:53] was Elohim,
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; we were attributes. HE PUT HIMSELF into
[1:52:58] the logos.
[1:53:00] Then we HAD OUR THEOPHANES. NOW WE ARE
[1:53:02] HERE ON FLESH. SO THIS MORNING I'M NOT
[1:53:06] TRYING to convince you
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; to believe our MESSAGE BASED ON WHAT IS
[1:53:13] happening in the flesh.
[1:53:16] OUR MESSAGE GOES BEYOND THE FLESH. AMEN.
[1:53:22] OUR MESSAGE GOES BEYOND
[1:53:25] RIGHT AT THE BACK PART OF THE MIND OF
[1:53:27] GOD.
[1:53:29] AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF WE
[1:53:31] FIND YOU THERE, WE WILL FIND YOU HERE.
[1:53:36] AND IF WE DON'T FIND YOU THERE, WE WILL
[1:53:39] NOT FIND YOU HERE.
[1:53:41] AMEN.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; You see, those that sleep in church must
[1:53:45] say something with us.
[1:53:49] I want just to them to testify that when
[1:53:51] they sleep in church, what happens to
[1:53:53] their theopa?
[1:54:01] Are you still with me? Amen. Because
[1:54:04] we preach to you theophony.
[1:54:07] The reason you ARE RAISING YOUR HANDS
[1:54:10] IS BECAUSE YOU ARE THEOPHONY.
[1:54:12] Raising the hand. THE REASON YOU say
[1:54:15] amen IS BECAUSE YOU ARE THEOPHONY.
[1:54:19] IT'S SAY AMEN.
[1:54:21] THIS MORNING. THE REASON YOU CAME TO
[1:54:23] CHURCH, SOME OF YOU, YOU HAD MANY
[1:54:25] REASONS,
[1:54:27] BUT SOMETHING PULLED YOU INTO CHURCH.
[1:54:30] IT'S YOUR THEOP.
[1:54:32] YOU ARE UNDER THE CONTROL and influence
[1:54:34] of your theoph
[1:54:48] says no more doubt.
[1:54:50] referring to the Samaritan woman.
[1:54:55] Amen.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; You didn't have to explain it.
[1:54:59] There are certain things.
[1:55:02] We don't need to explain that.
[1:55:04] Those that were meant to believe will
[1:55:06] believe.
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:10] Elizabeth
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; after she received the angelic
[1:55:13] visitation
[1:55:17] she rushed to Mary
[1:55:20] she couldn't go anywhere else
[1:55:22] other women would have never understood
[1:55:24] Elizabeth
[1:55:26] only Mary could understand Elizabeth
[1:55:31] AND WHEN MARY SAW ELIZABETH COMING
[1:55:35] Mary didn't bring MANY SCRIPTURES
[1:55:37] QUOTATIONS
[1:55:40] AND TRY TO DEBATE
[1:55:42] or Elizabeth. No, ELIZABETH KNEW ONE
[1:55:46] THING. THE SAME ANGEL THAT CAME TO ME IS
[1:55:50] THE SAME ANGEL THAT WENT TO MARY. SO
[1:55:54] MARY ALREADY BELIEVES WHAT I BELIEVE.
[1:55:58] AS SOON AS Mary or ELIZABETH SAW MARY,
[1:56:03] SHE SAID, "THE MOTHER OF MY LORD."
[1:56:05] [Music]
[1:56:06] AND MARY SAID,
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; THE ANGEL SAID, "I SHALL have a son,
[1:56:12] and I SHALL CALL HIS NAME, JESUS, John
[1:56:18] the messenger THE FORERUNNER.
[1:56:21] HE WAS A DEAD BABY. BUT WHEN THAT NAME
[1:56:24] WAS UTTERED,
[1:56:27] JOHN THAT WAS DEAD, HE LIMPED WITH JOY.
[1:56:32] OUR THINGS CANNOT BE EXPLAINED.
[1:56:36] They must be believed.
[1:56:39] Amen.
[1:56:40] Amen. They say you didn't have to
[1:56:42] explain it.
[1:56:45] She saw it.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; She believed it.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; And she went away.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; WHY? WHAT did it do to her? It redeemed
[1:56:55] her.
[1:56:58] I I don't know. It's more like having a
[1:57:01] cell phone
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; and your cell phone has got no network
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; because you are away from the tower.
[1:57:09] But at the moment you come closer TO THE
[1:57:10] TOWER
[1:57:12] then you see the network bar
[1:57:15] loading one by one
[1:57:18] until it is fully loaded. And even you
[1:57:21] there was a time YOU HAD NO NETWORK THEN
[1:57:25] YOU CAME to me tabernacle
[1:57:27] and there was a tower pastor here then
[1:57:30] you came within the range of the TOWER
[1:57:33] THEN THE BUS STARTED LOADING.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:38] Until it said connected.
[1:57:43] So,
[1:57:45] but your cell phone cannot load the
[1:57:50] network
[1:57:52] unless you've got a SIM card.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; We can put it in top OF THE TOWER.
[1:57:59] BUT IF it does not have a network, the B
[1:58:02] will NEVER MOVE. BUT YOU HAD A SIM CARD
[1:58:07] WHICH IS A CHIN OF GOD.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU CAME CLOSER TO THE TOWER,
[1:58:13] AH,
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT CONNECTED.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; CONNECTED.
[1:58:21] Are you not amazed that we can preach
[1:58:23] the gospel?
[1:58:25] Are you not amazed that we can preach
[1:58:27] the gospel?
[1:58:29] And your soul is on you having a
[1:58:32] jubilee.
[1:58:34] Another one is just even sleeping.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; It's a problem of network.
[1:58:44] [Music]
[1:58:47] I'm so
[1:58:50] you know when your phone gets connected
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; it's just start downloading
[1:58:57] those that are in it they'll say it's
[1:58:59] connected to the cloud.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; And it downloads from the cloud.
[1:59:08] Even us,
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; we are connected
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; to the cloud connected
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; and we are downloading from the cloud.
[1:59:16] [Applause]
[1:59:22] Hallelujah.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Somewhere
[1:59:27] I was told
[1:59:29] they've removed the pictures of the of
[1:59:31] the cloud and the pillar of fire.
[1:59:37] and they said it's confusing the people
[1:59:43] then I realized the church itself is not
[1:59:46] connected
[1:59:50] if you connected to that cloud connected
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; you don't have a problem
[1:59:59] we have it in our homes
[2:00:02] we have it in our churches
[2:00:04] We can have it in our cars
[2:00:08] because what's happening
[2:00:10] the picture of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:17] Amen.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:00:19] the prophet carries on in the future
[2:00:21] home.
[2:00:24] He says, "Now here it was
[2:00:29] in this little woman.
[2:00:32] She was one of his attributes.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; There was the priest.
[2:00:40] He was representing the light.
[2:00:44] He had learned it from the Bible.
[2:00:47] He had learned that God was God.
[2:00:50] He had learned that holiness was right.
[2:00:54] He was learned,
[2:00:57] that there was a law of God.
[2:01:00] He had learned because of intellectual
[2:01:02] conception.
[2:01:06] He was born in the right lineage.
[2:01:11] He was a Levite but he only knowed by
[2:01:14] intellectual conception.
[2:01:19] But when the light of the hour
[2:01:23] he landed by what had happened,
[2:01:26] not what was happening. His
[2:01:30] denomination said nothing about it.
[2:01:34] Therefore, he had no representation of
[2:01:38] Israel.
[2:01:40] He he met all the credentials.
[2:01:43] He lived the right life,
[2:01:46] came from the right lineage,
[2:01:50] knew the Torah,
[2:01:52] but inside there was nothing. But here
[2:01:55] is a woman, a prostitute, a non-church
[2:01:59] member just moving around, but she had a
[2:02:02] representation.
[2:02:04] Maybe had much better say.
[2:02:07] Maybe I had much better say.
[2:02:10] You must not judge the book by its
[2:02:12] cover.
[2:02:16] Don't look at somebody and just write
[2:02:19] them off.
[2:02:21] You don't know what is on the inside.
[2:02:24] You know when we get to heaven, we will
[2:02:26] be surprised who we find there.
[2:02:31] Maybe let me just mess up your church
[2:02:33] theology.
[2:02:37] Here is a thief on the cross.
[2:02:41] Not baptized.
[2:02:46] Never been to a church.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; But now he's there. He's dying. Then he
[2:02:54] LOOKS AT HIM.
[2:02:56] BUT HE LOOKS AT HIM AGAIN AND SAID, "NO,
[2:02:59] NO, NO, NO. This is NOT AN ORDINARY
[2:03:02] MAN." HE SAID, "MY LORD, REMEMBER ME
[2:03:06] WHEN YOU COME IN YOUR KINGDOM." AND
[2:03:09] JESUS SAID, "TODAY,
[2:03:11] YOU WILL BE WITH ME IN PARADISE."
[2:03:16] Brother Bill, I can imagine
[2:03:20] when they get to paradise,
[2:03:23] they must have asked him,
[2:03:26] "Who are you?
[2:03:28] I'm just a thief. Were you baptized?"
[2:03:31] "Oh, I was not baptized.
[2:03:33] Why are you here?" But the Bible says to
[2:03:36] know him is life.
[2:03:40] The priest knew him.
[2:03:44] The thief knew him.
[2:03:46] And we MUST KNOW HIM.
[2:03:49] AMEN.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Let's come maybe in the stage of a
[2:03:57] perfect man of a perfect manag 300.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham speaks
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; and I loved how he described the meaning
[2:04:10] of godliness.
[2:04:12] [Music]
[2:04:14] He says, "What does goness mean?"
[2:04:18] He said, "I looked in four or five
[2:04:20] dictionaries
[2:04:23] and I couldn't even find what it meant."
[2:04:29] He says, "And finally
[2:04:31] I was down at brother Jeff there."
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; He says, "We found it in a dictionary.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Godliness
[2:04:41] means
[2:04:43] to be like God.
[2:04:46] So when we aspire for goodness,
[2:04:52] it means we want to be like God.
[2:04:56] And I want to take a few minutes
[2:05:00] to say what does it mean
[2:05:02] to be like God? You know I don't know
[2:05:05] how many of you have heard the prophet.
[2:05:09] He say had he been given a chance to
[2:05:11] choose in which age he was going to live
[2:05:13] in.
[2:05:18] He say he would have never chosen the
[2:05:20] time of Abraham.
[2:05:22] He would have never chosen the time of
[2:05:24] Isaiah.
[2:05:26] He would have never even chosen the time
[2:05:27] when Jesus was here.
[2:05:30] He says he would have chosen this time.
[2:05:34] What's special about THIS TIME?
[2:05:39] YOU KNOW in our time, brother Bill,
[2:05:42] Amen.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; God had gifts
[2:05:45] in a basket
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; and he was giving them to the church.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; He gave the gift of divine healing.
[2:05:54] He gave the gift of tongues,
[2:05:57] gave all those gifts
[2:05:59] throughout the seven churches. But in
[2:06:02] our time, he went into the basket
[2:06:07] in order to give us something and there
[2:06:10] was nothing in the basket.
[2:06:13] Then God realized THAT OUR AGE, the
[2:06:17] giver
[2:06:19] must become the gift.
[2:06:22] So the Lord gave himself
[2:06:27] to a believer.
[2:06:30] Amen.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Listen to the conflict between God and
[2:06:33] Satan.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; He says now 107.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now what is the word of God?"
[2:06:41] He said, "The word of God is God
[2:06:45] himself."
[2:06:47] So God gave the believer.
[2:06:51] He say amen. Amen.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; Is God himself?
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; He gave the believer himself.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:02] TO ATTACK THE ENEMY BY.
[2:07:06] So in OUR TIME YOU CANNOT ATTACK the
[2:07:09] enemy with tongues.
[2:07:14] You speak in tonesues then the enemy
[2:07:16] speak in tonesues.
[2:07:19] YOU PERFORM A MIRACLE, THE ENEMY
[2:07:21] PERFORMS HIS MIRACLE. BUT THERE IS ONE
[2:07:24] THING THAT THE ENEMY CANNOT IMPERSONATE.
[2:07:29] THE ENEMY CANNOT HAVE HIM.
[2:07:33] BUT IN OUR TIME, GOD GAVE HIMSELF.
[2:07:38] That's what the SCRIPTURE SAYS. THE LORD
[2:07:41] HIMSELF SHALL DESCEND.
[2:07:44] SO THE give the giver BECAME THE GIFT
[2:07:49] IN ORDER TO ATTACK THE ENEMY BY.
[2:07:53] NOW when the enemy IS COMING TO ATTACK
[2:07:54] YOU, SOME OF YOU YOU HAVE CONFUSED the
[2:07:57] enemy.
[2:07:58] He tried this, you are still worshiping.
[2:08:02] He tried that, you're still woriing.
[2:08:05] THEY DON'T GREET YOU, YOU'RE WORIING.
[2:08:08] THEY HATE YOU, YOU'RE WORIING. YOU HAVE
[2:08:11] NO JOB, YOU'RE WORIING. WHY IS BECAUSE
[2:08:15] THERE IS SOMEONE
[2:08:18] ON THE INSIDE OF THE INSIDE.
[2:08:21] AMEN. AMEN.
[2:08:23] [Applause]
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; The Lord
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; in the heart of the believer,
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; he's carrying a believer.
[2:08:36] God is worshiping himself.
[2:08:39] In a believer,
[2:08:41] A BELIEVER HAS BECOME GOD'S TABERNACLE.
[2:08:48] God is WALKING ON TWO FEET.
[2:08:51] SOMEBODY CAN SAY I'M THE ADDRESS OF GOD
[2:08:54] IN 2025.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; I don't JUST COME TO CHURCH.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; I BRING HIM TO CHURCH. I TAKE HIM HOME.
[2:09:04] I GO HIM TO THE WORKPLACE. I GO TO THE
[2:09:07] UNIVERSITY WITH HIM BECAUSE HE GAVE ME
[2:09:09] HIMSELF.
[2:09:13] AMEN.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; BROTHER.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; YES, PASTOR. If we give you mangoes,
[2:09:20] we might run out
[2:09:22] or we might even run out of the patience
[2:09:24] to give you them.
[2:09:28] But if you can have a tree,
[2:09:32] you have everything.
[2:09:34] When you have him, YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.
[2:09:38] SO TODAY I'M PREACHING to people.
[2:09:41] THEY have him.
[2:09:43] Amen.
[2:09:46] And once you have him,
[2:09:49] you have reached a point of no return.
[2:09:53] Do you know that there are people
[2:09:56] they will never backslide?
[2:10:00] They will never go back to the world.
[2:10:03] They are here to stay.
[2:10:06] DURING GOOD TIMES,
[2:10:08] DURING BAD TIMES, THEY ARE HERE TO STAY.
[2:10:13] AND THEY SAY SOMETHING IS HOLDING ME.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HOLDING YOU?
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; HE himself
[2:10:21] is in you.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:28] Gave. God gave what? In our time.
[2:10:34] That means God in our time is material.
[2:10:40] Amen.
[2:10:45] Brother Brenham,
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Brother is in church
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; and there's a young couple.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; They are busy doing funny things.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; And God says, the word says to the
[2:11:03] voice,
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; you just speak the word
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; and it will happen. If you can say die,
[2:11:15] they will pack them out.
[2:11:19] Brother says he stood there
[2:11:23] and he looked at them
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; and he said, "I wonder if it was us."
[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:11:34] But because this was not just a son,
[2:11:40] it's adopted son.
[2:11:42] He's tested.
[2:11:44] He's got character.
[2:11:47] And character makes him fit to rule
[2:11:52] because power without character
[2:11:55] makes you demonic.
[2:11:57] BUT THIS ONE, HE WAS A MAN OF CHARACTER.
[2:12:01] HE SAID, "I FORGIVE YOU."
[2:12:05] Brother said, "At night, the Holy Ghost
[2:12:08] was pleased with me."
[2:12:13] What was happening? It's not him that
[2:12:15] forgive.
[2:12:16] It's because he himself.
[2:12:19] He was in the prophet. That's why he can
[2:12:22] forgive.
[2:12:24] And today, HE HIMSELF IS IN US. THAT'S
[2:12:28] WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS. WHATEVER YOU
[2:12:30] BIND
[2:12:32] HERE ON EARTH SHALL BE BOUND THERE. IT
[2:12:35] MUST START HERE ON EARTH. WHATEVER YOU
[2:12:38] SET loose here shall BE SET LOOSE THERE.
[2:12:42] SO TODAY WE'VE GOT THE AUTHORITY.
[2:12:45] I saw we've got many prayer requests of
[2:12:46] people sick
[2:12:49] because he gave HIMSELF TO US
[2:12:52] AND HE IS IN US UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF
[2:12:56] THE WORD OF GOD. WE CAN DECLARE ALL THE
[2:12:59] PEOPLE THAT ARE SICK HEALED. AMEN.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; And you can say, "Who do you think YOU
[2:13:05] ARE
[2:13:07] greater than Solomon is here?"
[2:13:11] But he's in us.
[2:13:14] Amen.
[2:13:16] The prophet says,
[2:13:19] "And all things are possible to him that
[2:13:21] believeth."
[2:13:24] He says, "If you are the son of God,
[2:13:28] You're not like Z.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; You're like who?
[2:13:35] You're like God.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; You are like
[2:13:40] you love like God.
[2:13:42] You forgive like God.
[2:13:46] You are able to bear the burdens of
[2:13:48] other people like God.
[2:13:54] Because you are like God.
[2:13:56] and say he just speaks the word
[2:13:59] and it creates itself
[2:14:02] and his word is the creative power.
[2:14:07] If the church can only recognize who she
[2:14:10] is,
[2:14:13] the devil stands no chance.
[2:14:16] Maybe my brother while we are here
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; bring this quotation in. How can I
[2:14:21] overcome?
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Quotation here. How can I overcome?
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 105.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 105.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; If you had it
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; 25th of August 90 1963
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; 1963 I want us to read it.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; The prophet says
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; overcome.
[2:14:44] There are people that think that to
[2:14:45] overcome is when you pray a long prayer.
[2:14:52] No, no, no, no.
[2:14:54] Is when you first 40 days. No, no, no.
[2:14:59] Overcome
[2:15:01] means to recognize the David
[2:15:06] in every one of his tricks.
[2:15:11] Not many people recognize the devil's
[2:15:13] tricks.
[2:15:15] The prophecy a lot of people says
[2:15:19] there is no David. It's just a thought.
[2:15:23] He says, "DON'T YOU BELIEVE THAT?"
[2:15:25] THERE IS A REAL DAVID.
[2:15:28] He's just as real as you are or anybody.
[2:15:34] A real David. You must recognize HIM
[2:15:37] REAL.
[2:15:39] YOU MUST KNOW HE IS A DAVID.
[2:15:43] Then the same time that you recognize
[2:15:45] him,
[2:15:46] you know that that's a David
[2:15:50] and he's against you. This one we must
[2:15:53] tell you the devil is against you.
[2:15:57] The devil IS AGAINST THIS CHURCH.
[2:16:00] THE DEVIL IS AGAINST YOUR family
[2:16:03] because you operate from a different
[2:16:05] kingdom.
[2:16:07] Now he say that it's a when you and know
[2:16:11] that he's a devil,
[2:16:14] he is against you. Then to overcome,
[2:16:18] you must recognize
[2:16:20] THAT THE GOD
[2:16:22] NOT IN HEAVEN.
[2:16:24] THE GOD IN YOU is greater
[2:16:29] MIGHTIER
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; THAN HE IS
[2:16:34] THAN THE ONE THAT'S IN YOU
[2:16:37] has already overcome him.
[2:16:42] AND BY HIS GRACE, YOU ARE MORE THAN A
[2:16:45] MATCH FOR HIM.
[2:16:48] This what I want to say to you. YOU ARE
[2:16:51] MORE THAN A MATCH AGAINST SATAN.
[2:16:55] IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE DOES BECAUSE
[2:16:58] WHY? YOU HAVE COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE
[2:17:01] ONE IN ME IS MORE MIGHTIER,
[2:17:05] IS MORE GREATER, IS MORE POWERFUL. THE
[2:17:09] ANSWER THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
[2:17:12] IS NOT IN HEAVEN. THE DEITY IS NO LONGER
[2:17:16] IN HEAVEN, BUT THE DEITY IS IN YOU.
[2:17:22] NO WONDER YOU ARE THE DEVILS.
[2:17:24] You see the problem
[2:17:27] when you don't know who you are,
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; you don't know at which level you can
[2:17:32] operate.
[2:17:35] If a man is a manager in a company,
[2:17:38] but he doesn't know that he's a manager.
[2:17:42] He can behave like a god.
[2:17:46] Are you still with me? The answer
[2:17:50] is recognizing who YOU ARE.
[2:17:53] Are you still with me here? And this is
[2:17:56] when I want you brother say when you
[2:17:58] come and recognize who you are, it
[2:18:00] drives the devil mad.
[2:18:06] Have you realized that the moment you
[2:18:07] recognize WHO YOU ARE?
[2:18:10] IT UPSETS A LOT OF PEOPLE.
[2:18:13] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE ARE NOT
[2:18:15] DOWN TROLLING PEOPLE.
[2:18:18] WE ARE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD WALK
[2:18:19] AROUND with long faces.
[2:18:23] I want TO SAY IN THE END TIME
[2:18:27] GOD HAS FOUND A RESIDENCE.
[2:18:32] The God HAS FOUND A DWELLING PLACE.
[2:18:36] AND WHERE'S THE DWELLING PLACE? IT'S MY
[2:18:39] BROTHER. IT'S ME TOO.
[2:18:43] Brother says coming a time.
[2:18:46] He say if my field if there is no rain
[2:18:50] and my crops are burning because of the
[2:18:52] sun.
[2:18:54] I can go to my brother and say my
[2:18:56] brother I'VE GOT A PROBLEM ON MY FARM. I
[2:19:00] NEED RAIN. And my brother CAN SAY TO ME
[2:19:03] IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST I GIVE YOU
[2:19:08] RAIN. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRENHAM asked sister,
[2:19:15] "Sister, WHAT DO YOU WANT?" AND SISTER
[2:19:18] SAID, "The greatest desire
[2:19:21] is the salvation OF MY TWO BOYS."
[2:19:24] BROTHER BRHAM SAYS, "SISTER,
[2:19:27] IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST,
[2:19:30] I
[2:19:31] WHO IS HE IS GOD IN HIM?" GAVE SISTER
[2:19:37] HER CHILDREN. AMEN.
[2:19:40] [Music]
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; Are you Are you with me?
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Most of the time we're better
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; because we don't know who we are.
[2:19:57] You know me, I'm not afraid of a witch.
[2:20:02] No, no, no.
[2:20:05] Actually,
[2:20:08] which is the cheapest thing?
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; Which is the cheapest thing?
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; You know, in military there's what we
[2:20:19] call a signal jammer.
[2:20:26] If we put a signal jammer here,
[2:20:29] all your cell phones will not work.
[2:20:32] They won't pick up the signal
[2:20:35] because there is a signal there.
[2:20:38] So a son of God, a daughter of God is a
[2:20:42] signal jam.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Are you not amazed that some of your
[2:20:48] relatives they don't want you to visit
[2:20:50] longer?
[2:20:55] It's because you jam signals.
[2:20:57] [Music]
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AMEN. WHEREVER YOU GO, YOU
[2:21:02] JAMMED SIGNALS. SO WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID
[2:21:05] ABOUT? SO WHEREVER YOU GO, you can say a
[2:21:08] signal has arrived
[2:21:11] [Applause]
[2:21:17] until we can't communicate, man.
[2:21:23] Network is a mess
[2:21:25] [Music]
[2:21:27] because the signal chamber is there.
[2:21:31] Go to back to your home and be a signal
[2:21:33] jammer.
[2:21:35] Go to your workplace and be a signal
[2:21:37] jammer.
[2:21:40] DON'T BE AFRAID OF ANYTHING.
[2:21:43] THE ONE THAT IS IN YOU IS A SIGNAL
[2:21:45] JAMMER.
[2:21:46] [Applause]
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Question and answers.
[2:21:56] Is that true?
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Is the clock working?
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. Cuz some they only correct twice a
[2:22:07] day.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; This one is correct all the time.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; The prophet says
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; question and answers.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Question and answers.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 62.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 62. It says when God created
[2:22:27] me
[2:22:29] William Brenham,
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; I was made before
[2:22:34] foundation of the world.
[2:22:37] He made my being,
[2:22:40] my spirit.
[2:22:42] I wasn't conscious of anything as far as
[2:22:44] I know of.
[2:22:50] I was there.
[2:22:53] It says I don't believe you are getting
[2:22:55] it.
[2:22:57] He says now just a minute. Jesus told
[2:23:00] the disciples
[2:23:02] that he
[2:23:04] he knew them before the foundation of
[2:23:08] the world
[2:23:10] and Paul said here that
[2:23:13] he chose us in him before the world
[2:23:17] began.
[2:23:20] He said there was some part of me
[2:23:24] never
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; and the rest of you all here
[2:23:28] that's in Christ Jesus before the world
[2:23:30] ever began.
[2:23:34] He say here's to my analysis of that.
[2:23:38] I think that the people today
[2:23:41] that are possessed with this spirit,
[2:23:46] I'm glad later he realized that people
[2:23:48] may not catch it and put capital letter
[2:23:50] S.
[2:23:55] Then he dropped it. He says or the
[2:23:57] spirit
[2:24:01] because you remember he said he was a
[2:24:02] spirit.
[2:24:04] And it says a part of the angelic
[2:24:07] beings.
[2:24:10] It says spirits
[2:24:13] which rotated
[2:24:15] [Music]
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; of of God.
[2:24:21] So there are people here in them there
[2:24:25] are spirits and those spirits were not
[2:24:29] created
[2:24:31] because anything created has got a
[2:24:32] beginning
[2:24:36] and has an end. But there are people
[2:24:38] here they are the offshoot of God.
[2:24:45] Are you still with me here? They rotated
[2:24:48] of God.
[2:24:50] What does it mean? They as eternal. They
[2:24:54] as eternal as God is eternal. They are
[2:24:59] as supernatural
[2:25:01] as God is supernatural.
[2:25:04] There are people here that have got no
[2:25:06] beginning of days. I'm not referring TO
[2:25:09] THIS MAN, BUT I'M REFERRING TO THE MANY
[2:25:12] WITHIN THIS MAN.
[2:25:16] This one has got a beginning of this and
[2:25:20] has got the ending of this. But the one
[2:25:22] inside
[2:25:24] is the offshoot
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; of MelkiseDC.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Mechisedc had no beginning of days and
[2:25:32] the people that are of his offshoot.
[2:25:36] Are you hearing me?
[2:25:38] WHEN YOU DIE IN THE HOSPITAL,
[2:25:41] the you know you can they cannot call an
[2:25:43] undertaker
[2:25:46] before uptaker comes.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; There must BE AN THE UPTAKE IS ALWAYS
[2:25:52] FIRST on the SCENE
[2:25:56] that before the mivas come and take
[2:25:58] their part,
[2:26:00] let me go and TAKE MY PART.
[2:26:04] ONE PART, THE PART THAT ROTATED of him,
[2:26:10] THAT PART CANNOT GO INTO THE GRAVE.
[2:26:14] THAT PART WAS NEVER BORN.
[2:26:18] This this one was born.
[2:26:20] This one shall die. BUT THE ONE ON THE
[2:26:23] INSIDE
[2:26:25] IS renewed daily.
[2:26:28] Are you are you LISTENING TO ME HERE?
[2:26:30] DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS.
[2:26:33] THIS ONE WILL GET SICK. THIS ONE WILL GO
[2:26:36] THROUGH TRIALS. THIS ONE WILL BECOME
[2:26:39] OLD. BUT THE ONE ON THE INSIDE
[2:26:42] WILL NEVER BECOME OLD. THE ONE ON THE
[2:26:45] INSIDE, THE DEVIL CAN NEVER EVEN REACH
[2:26:48] HIM.
[2:26:49] THE ONE ON THE INSIDE IS INFALLIBLE.
[2:26:55] THE ONE ON THE INSIDE IS INVINCIBLE.
[2:26:59] [Applause]
[2:27:01] I'M talking to SOME PEOPLE HERE. SATAN
[2:27:04] CAN NEVER DEFEAT THEM.
[2:27:07] I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE HERE. THE DEVIL
[2:27:10] WILL NEVER PULL THEM OUT OF THE CAMP.
[2:27:15] They are here TO STAY.
[2:27:18] THEY WERE BELIEVERS THERE. THEY ARE
[2:27:20] BELIEVERS HERE AND THEY GOING BACK AS
[2:27:23] BELIEVERS.
[2:27:25] THE END time conditions. THE END TIME
[2:27:28] CONDITIONS.
[2:27:30] WILL NEVER CHANGE THEM.
[2:27:32] AMEN. But others, as long as somebody
[2:27:35] can go past them and not greet them,
[2:27:38] I'm not going to church NEXT WEEK. BUT
[2:27:41] OTHERS, WHETHER they greet them or they
[2:27:44] don't greet them, they will be here.
[2:27:48] Others, whether they have money or they
[2:27:51] DON'T HAVE MONEY, YOU FIND THEM HERE.
[2:27:54] WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM? WORSHIP IS
[2:27:57] NOT A SUNDAY ACTIVITY
[2:28:00] TO THEM. WORSHIP IS WHO they are
[2:28:05] FROM ETERNITY
[2:28:07] AND THEY ARE going back to eternity.
[2:28:10] Amen.
[2:28:12] If you can find a believer
[2:28:17] that is
[2:28:21] you know the only in the house
[2:28:24] Yeah. Yeah.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; That one.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; You know the area in the old area of a
[2:28:30] television in the house.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you need to move it around,
[2:28:39] put something
[2:28:41] and watch for few minutes. They say sh
[2:28:45] then you need to. Some believers are
[2:28:47] like that.
[2:28:50] Deacons must come.
[2:28:54] to put the signal.
[2:28:56] [Music]
[2:29:01] But there are others.
[2:29:04] It's connected.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; They are here all the time.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; And we appreciate God for those.
[2:29:17] Amen. Amen.
[2:29:24] I'm getting old. I'm used to be a very
[2:29:27] short preacher, but I'm getting old.
[2:29:31] [Music]
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; But I want to show you a few things.
[2:29:39] Brother Brenham, brother, you know,
[2:29:42] brother Peter,
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; a good driver
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; knows
[2:29:51] The higher the speed,
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; the higher they g.
[2:30:01] If you can drive
[2:30:03] 120 km on the N1,
[2:30:07] 120 km
[2:30:09] and decide to take from gear number
[2:30:13] seven
[2:30:16] and take it to one,
[2:30:18] what will happen to the engine?
[2:30:23] It will cease
[2:30:25] this
[2:30:28] problem. The church of God is moving on
[2:30:32] the runway.
[2:30:34] It's running at his feet.
[2:30:37] Some preachers, they want to come to the
[2:30:40] gear
[2:30:42] and take it to one. SO, WE ARE KEEPING
[2:30:45] THEM AWAY
[2:30:47] THAT WE can't go to gear one.
[2:30:50] We are done with the first pool.
[2:30:53] We can't go TO THE SECOND POOL. WE WANT
[2:30:56] TO BE ON THE THIRD POOL BECAUSE RIGHT WE
[2:30:59] ABOUT TO TAKE OFF.
[2:31:02] [Music]
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; So brother Brennham Brennham when he was
[2:31:07] preaching you go and listen to this
[2:31:09] tape.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; Perfect faith.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; He prayed to almost over 100 people.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; I know it was more than 100.
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:23] uh and he prayed for them in less than
[2:31:26] seven minutes.
[2:31:31] When you go and read in that book,
[2:31:34] Brother Brenam is not actually praying
[2:31:35] for them.
[2:31:38] They come through the prayer line.
[2:31:40] He say, "Sister, receive your healing.
[2:31:44] Brother, I receive your healing. My
[2:31:46] brother receive your healing."
[2:31:48] then they going through
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; and I think those people must have
[2:31:52] wondered
[2:31:55] why is brother not laying hands.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; So he's answering what he was doing in
[2:32:01] that service.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; He says perfect faith 213 faith 213.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; He says this is coming into that third
[2:32:11] pool.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; I'm believing it. Amen. I want you to I
[2:32:17] want to ask you a sincere question.
[2:32:22] You that passed through the prayer line,
[2:32:25] can you actually believe and feel now
[2:32:30] that there is something something
[2:32:32] happened in you since you had hands laid
[2:32:35] on you?
[2:32:39] He was just touching them as they were
[2:32:40] moving somewhere where I'm going. He
[2:32:43] said, "There it is. This is what I've
[2:32:46] waited for.
[2:32:49] This is just starting to bloom now."
[2:32:52] He say, "I did this for a purpose.
[2:32:56] I did this for a purpose.
[2:32:59] I'M WORKING OUT SOMETHING."
[2:33:02] SEE, IT'S taking this charge of faith.
[2:33:06] Hallelujah. And going right back to
[2:33:08] begin.
[2:33:10] can come and see to kind of raise faith.
[2:33:16] He wanted to RAISE FAITH
[2:33:19] IN a bracket
[2:33:22] where you have never noticed that way
[2:33:24] before.
[2:33:27] Not a faith,
[2:33:31] not a faith,
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; but a perfect faith.
[2:33:38] Build it up here. Then he carries on. He
[2:33:42] says the GREAT PHYSICIAN
[2:33:45] WHO is here who said this sign shall
[2:33:47] follow them that believe.
[2:33:50] If they lay the hands on the sick they
[2:33:52] shall come and if you say to this
[2:33:54] mountain be moved
[2:33:56] and don't doubt in your heart but can
[2:33:58] believe then he say if he can create
[2:34:01] schoolers
[2:34:04] who has no way at all or nothing that
[2:34:06] you believe.
[2:34:10] He say now listen to what he say it's my
[2:34:12] own faith
[2:34:14] that goes and does that
[2:34:17] my faith in what he challenged me to
[2:34:20] ask.
[2:34:24] He said he challenged me to ask
[2:34:28] and I received his challenge in
[2:34:30] obedience to HIS WORD.
[2:34:34] I ASKED IT and and it appeared.
[2:34:38] Referring to the squirrels, he said,
[2:34:40] "God in heaven knows that's true.
[2:34:43] Can't he also heal the sick?"
[2:34:47] He's telling the church that the
[2:34:48] squirrels came by the spoken word.
[2:34:54] Now, cannot the sick be healed by the
[2:34:56] spoken word?
[2:35:00] Then then listen TO WHAT HE'S SAYING. HE
[2:35:02] SAID, "IF HE can lift me
[2:35:06] with a faith up this way,
[2:35:09] even for the people,
[2:35:12] even if they can't climb to that
[2:35:14] bracket,
[2:35:17] if they can't do it, he can use my
[2:35:21] faith.
[2:35:22] He can lift me to THAT PLACE."
[2:35:26] AND the prophet say, "I am climbing for
[2:35:28] you.
[2:35:32] And that's WHY YOUR PASTOR
[2:35:35] CAN TAKE YOU INTO A HIGHER BRACKET
[2:35:40] where if YOU DON'T BELIEVE,
[2:35:42] HE BELIEVES FOR YOU.
[2:35:45] SO BROTHER SAY IF THEY can't climb,
[2:35:49] I'M CLIMBING FOR YOU.
[2:35:52] AND SAY I AM BELIEVING FOR YOU.
[2:35:56] AND HE SAY I'M SPEAKING FOR YOU.
[2:36:00] AND THIS ONE I WILL REPEAT IT. A MAN OF
[2:36:03] GOD WILL TRIUMPH FOR YOU. A MAN OF GOD
[2:36:08] WILL BELIEVE FOR YOU. A MAN OF GOD WILL
[2:36:12] SPEAK FOR YOU. THE PRIEST IN THE OLD
[2:36:15] TESTAMENT,
[2:36:16] the priest, he had the names of the
[2:36:19] tribes of Israel
[2:36:21] on his chest. and he used to go into THE
[2:36:25] PRESENCE OF GOD WITH THE NAMES OF THE
[2:36:28] CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ON HIS CHEST. A REAL
[2:36:31] PASTOR HAS GOT THE NAMES OF HIS people
[2:36:35] on his chest AND HE GOES BEFORE GOD AND
[2:36:40] BELIEVES FOR THEM AND PLANS FOR THEM.
[2:36:43] ARE YOU STILL WITH ME HERE?
[2:36:47] AMEN.
[2:36:52] Is it 2021?
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah,

[2:45:38] we want to thank you Lord this

[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord for bringing us this way
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; to hear your word.
[2:45:50] Thank you Lord for bringing pastor Miva

[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; We want to give you all the honor and
[2:45:58] all the glory for you deserve them my
[2:46:02] God.
[2:46:04] &gt;&gt; Our hearts are bubbling with joy.
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; We are going home a happy pupil
[2:46:12] &gt;&gt; because we have been addressed by our
[2:46:14] father.
[2:46:17] Thank you Lord
[2:46:19] for choosing us.
[2:46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; For making us the people.
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; Of this time.
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, the great secret
[2:46:32] that you had in the background of your
[2:46:35] mind,
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; we are so happy
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; to see it
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; manifested
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; in our day.
[2:46:46] It is no secret
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; that the Lord that
[2:46:52] they were seeking
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; is now in his tabernacle.
[2:46:58] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says,
[2:47:00] "Behold,
[2:47:03] that tabernacle of God is with men."
[2:47:08] &gt;&gt; They are no longer strangers.
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; They are no longer foreigners. Amen.
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[2:47:17] he shall be their God.
[2:47:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; And they shall be his people.
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; He will walk among them
[2:47:26] &gt;&gt; and they he will actually be in them.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord for choosing us to
[2:47:32] live in this day and age. Thank you Lord
[2:47:36] for making us who we are.
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; This is the time. This is the best of
[2:47:41] the times that anyone could live in. Oh
[2:47:44] God,
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; to live where Elohim
[2:47:51] has run out of gifts in the basket
[2:47:55] that he chose to give himself the giver
[2:47:59] &gt;&gt; to be the gift.
[2:48:02] Oh, when the bride can just realize that
[2:48:06] who she is,
[2:48:08] &gt;&gt; if she can just come to a realization,
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; that she is a signal gemma.
[2:48:17] &gt;&gt; I believe Paul had come to that point.
[2:48:21] &gt;&gt; And he said, is there anything
[2:48:24] that can separate us? Hallelujah.
[2:48:28] [Music]
[2:48:30] You have achieved my God,
[2:48:34] &gt;&gt; that which was in your backpack,
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; that secret,
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; that greatest secret.
[2:48:43] &gt;&gt; John could not get to that.
[2:48:48] Even Moses tried, but came a man who
[2:48:52] said, "Let us stand on the banister.
[2:48:55] Amen.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; Let us go way back there in the
[2:48:58] beginning just before the beginning.
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; And he took us back
[2:49:04] &gt;&gt; and we came to our realization.
[2:49:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you.
[2:49:09] &gt;&gt; Because this is the seventh seal.
[2:49:12] &gt;&gt; And when we see that happening, it's
[2:49:15] about time of change. When you see
[2:49:19] mechisedc in flesh,
[2:49:21] &gt;&gt; when you see Elohim in flesh,
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; something is about to happen.
[2:49:26] &gt;&gt; We are looking forward to that day, oh
[2:49:28] God, because you are here in us.
[2:49:32] &gt;&gt; We are looking for that day when we
[2:49:34] shall meet you in the skies. Bless your
[2:49:38] children. Bless Pastor Miva. Be with
[2:49:41] him. Give him more inspiration. Oh God,
[2:49:44] thank you Lord for using him today. and
[2:49:47] bless your children. Heavenly Father, we
[2:49:50] go home victorious.
[2:49:52] Oh, he was asking what it is to
[2:49:54] overcome. We know what it is today to
[2:49:57] overcome.
[2:49:59] Our being godliness is being like God.
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And heavenly father, we
[2:50:06] thank you for our pastor,
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; pastor Israelima.
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; May you be with him, heavenly father.
[2:50:13] May you strengthen him. Heavenly Father,
[2:50:16] it's a job well done. Oh God, raising
[2:50:19] men and women that are up to the
