[35:26] [Music]
[35:33] there. Wow. Let's give praise to the
[35:36] almighty god. Praise God.
[35:40] In vain just to come to church just to
[35:44] come and see each other. I think I don't
[35:46] think it's the purpose but the main
[35:47] purpose one of the good
[35:51] days ahead of us actually they know more
[35:54] than they they know better than us
[35:56] today. So they are more advanced than we
[35:58] than we are today.
[36:00] We are still poking here and there, but
[36:03] they already know and we
[36:12] appreciate and then to to bring us
[36:23] here and we appreciate everything, Lord.
[36:34] As we continue in this life, just know
[36:36] the steps that your mother took while on
[36:41] this. She was an example and just copy
[36:44] from there and let us continue in this
[36:47] journey. There will be test along
[37:10] my she used to call me my
[37:15] sister and I called her my
[37:21] Sheron. I knew
[37:31] until I left the side
[37:36] of Sheron is supportive and she's
[37:45] loving. She's a person who loves to
[37:47] share about the word.
[37:53] 2021. She really supports. I remember in
[38:03] 2021 when the father of my kids passed,
[38:06] she's the one who was on my side, gave
[38:09] me
[38:11] support through the love that she had.
[38:21] When I got the job that I'm doing now,
[38:23] when I went for
[38:29] training, when I told her that I'm
[38:31] leaving for training, she said, "My
[38:32] sister, don't
[38:37] worry." And indeed, she took care of my
[38:40] kids. There wasn't any
[38:44] worry. I came back. I told her that I'm
[38:47] done with my training. I'm coming
[38:55] back. She decided that I can't just come
[38:58] back without any event where we can
[39:08] celebrate. She threw a big party for me
[39:11] and that gave joy to all my brothers and
[39:14] sisters.
[39:19] before she can do that party, she asked
[39:21] me where can we do which venue can we
[39:27] use and I said to her the venue will be
[39:30] at home in the where I grew
[39:36] up I don't want to say much but I want
[39:39] to say
[39:47] Your mother didn't leave you without any
[39:49] parent. Your parent is here. It's
[39:55] me. Don't be afraid if you lack
[39:58] anything. Sister P of your mother is
[40:03] here. Continue living as we did.
[40:07] Thank you.
[40:09] [Applause]
[40:14] God bless you. Uh Dennis, we proceed to
[40:18] Balon speech by our siblings. Uh I will
[40:24] start by Fesa
[40:27] Mana and then followed by Tapelo. Amen.
[40:31] They will come following each other.
[40:34] Amen.
[40:49] Oh god.
[41:01] [Music]
[41:14] I greet you all in the name of our Lord
[41:16] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[41:19] Um I'm here to speak about Cece.
[41:27] Um and I was just
[41:29] talking that now we have to comfort our
[41:33] husband. We were thinking
[41:39] that the
[41:41] way was to
[41:46] us she was
[41:50] welcoming like I know that every Sunday
[41:54] or almost every
[41:57] Sunday will come by my place
[42:01] and if she doesn't come I'll call her
[42:04] sis are you not
[42:06] coming. I had a a great
[42:10] moment and is a blessing
[42:13] to have a a sister like
[42:17] her. Uh sister Cheron was a mother to
[42:21] her kids
[42:24] and she also become a mother to us
[42:28] and to our
[42:31] kids and becoming a point whereby if
[42:37] uh one of my boys
[42:41] sick before I can even think of going to
[42:43] the clinic
[42:48] I'll call and she will give me
[42:51] instruction.
[42:54] For example, if one of my son broke has
[42:57] a blocked
[43:02] nose will tell me what to do and and
[43:06] everything that I will do it work
[43:09] out. It's hard to let her
[43:13] go. But I just want to thank
[43:16] God because every
[43:18] moment with Cersei, it was a
[43:22] blessing. She had a open heart for us.
[43:27] I have never had any day
[43:36] that she took me as a little sister.
[43:41] She never get tired of my text.
[43:45] my
[43:46] calls. Whenever I call, she's always
[43:50] there. But what comfort our heart is
[43:54] that he's going to meet
[43:57] again. And when we meet again, we won't
[44:00] part anymore.
[44:03] I have a lot to say
[44:06] about but I just want to thank
[44:09] God for every
[44:12] moment for always being around.
[44:16] Thank you. Amen.
[44:18] [Applause]
[44:30] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[44:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[44:36] Amen. Amen.
[44:41] I greet all the saints in the name of
[44:42] our Lord Jesus
[44:48] Christ. I would like to greet all the
[44:50] saints in the name of our Lord Jesus
[44:51] Christ. Amen.
[44:54] [Applause]
[44:56] I'm here
[44:57] today to celebrate a soldier
[45:03] uh who happened to be my sister
[45:07] who by God's
[45:09] grace became our
[45:12] mother as you all
[45:14] know last year in November on the
[45:18] 23rd we were burying our
[45:21] mom but After
[45:24] that our sister took
[45:27] over. She closed the
[45:30] gap with distinctions.
[45:34] Amen. Amen. So we never even came to a
[45:38] point where we said if our mother was
[45:43] here because she our
[45:46] sister she was playing that role very
[45:50] well as auntie was
[45:55] saying she was not a the mother to just
[45:59] her
[46:01] kids but to every one of
[46:04] us And you know she's so
[46:07] accommodative, so
[46:10] generous, so
[46:12] delightful that when you are around
[46:15] her, you don't want to
[46:17] leave. And I always ask
[46:20] myself, what is that I can do so that I
[46:24] could always be closer to
[46:26] her? Because one thing that I I had
[46:29] almost um I had almost had
[46:33] forgotten is how much I loved
[46:35] her, you know, because growing up
[46:39] because she was the first born and I was
[46:42] the second and then we grew up together
[46:44] as
[46:46] twins, but because of the activities of
[46:51] life, we end up having to to to be
[46:55] apart, you or she got married. I got
[46:59] married and we started our own
[47:01] things. But after the passing of our
[47:04] mom, by God's
[47:07] grace, that gap was open
[47:10] again that I get a little bit closer to
[47:14] her. That's when that love that I've
[47:17] known when we were still
[47:20] young, I could now feel it. Now I I will
[47:24] tell you
[47:26] that three four weeks before a
[47:30] passing I was visiting a house almost
[47:33] every
[47:36] day and I I would leave about 10 11 12
[47:40] in the
[47:42] morning and I would say to my niece
[47:47] today I am not going to go to your
[47:49] house. I am not coming to your
[47:52] house. By 12:00, I will see myself
[47:56] leaving their house.
[47:58] I was saying the same thing every day.
[48:01] Little did I
[48:03] know I was beating her farewell and just
[48:07] to h because I I don't think tomorrow
[48:09] I'll have this
[48:12] opportunity just to give you a little
[48:13] bit of what happened before or what
[48:17] caused a
[48:18] departure.
[48:19] Of course, the main thing was that God
[48:22] missed her too
[48:26] much. He wanted him her more to on his
[48:31] side than we
[48:34] did. Our sister was not
[48:36] sick. She just had discomfort in her
[48:40] tummy. That was two weeks back. That was
[48:43] two week back on on
[48:45] Monday. And then on that Monday she did
[48:48] not go to
[48:50] work and she instead went to see the
[48:54] doctor and the doctor said you need to
[48:57] come back after two days so I could do I
[48:59] could put you through the
[49:02] scan. Indeed she returned back to the
[49:05] doctor and then she was put through the
[49:08] scan and then the doctor said I could
[49:10] pick up pick up um three if I'm not
[49:13] mistaken it was three gallstones.
[49:19] And then the doctor said, "No, it's
[49:20] something easy. They are not that
[49:22] serious. It's something as as easy as
[49:25] anything that you could think
[49:29] of." And then they set an appointment
[49:32] that come next week, Wednesday, so that
[49:33] we can we could remove
[49:37] them. It was on the 14th. That was last
[49:41] week, Wednesday.
[49:43] And then she she she on that the night
[49:46] before the
[49:48] 13th I was at a
[49:51] place and then I was even fighting with
[49:53] her. I say, "Hey, you know, it's almost
[49:56] 10. You're not supposed to be
[49:59] eating because tomorrow you're going for
[50:00] an
[50:02] operation." And then uh on on on Monday
[50:05] of that day of that
[50:08] week, she did send a the message to the
[50:12] pastor, notifying the pastor of uh the
[50:16] the
[50:18] activities. And then I left at I left
[50:21] her place at around about 11.
[50:25] And then she left in the morning around
[50:27] about 7 a.m.
[50:31] with her daughter, the eldest daughter.
[50:35] And then they went to the
[50:38] hospital. And then when they get to the
[50:40] hospital, they stayed together long, I
[50:42] think for about two
[50:44] hours up until she was called to the
[50:47] theater.
[50:50] Only when she was going to the theater,
[50:52] her daughter left.
[50:55] That's when her daughter waved her
[50:57] hand and the my sister responded by
[51:01] waving hand as well. That was their last
[51:05] communication and she went and then the
[51:09] doctor started the doctor started the
[51:12] procedure in trying to remove the girl
[51:15] stoles and then as they were busy they
[51:18] said my sister was got a what do you
[51:22] call a cardiac
[51:25] arrest and then they stopped the
[51:28] procedure
[51:30] and they resuscitated her.
[51:33] And then the the heart started working
[51:36] normally and then they stopped with the
[51:38] procedure
[51:41] completely the procure of removing the
[51:45] gallstones. They started to attend to to
[51:47] to to the to what caused the cardiac
[51:53] arrest and it was discovered that and it
[51:56] was discovered that there was a a a
[51:59] minor bleeding
[52:04] The doctor said to
[52:05] me, "It was so small that it couldn't
[52:08] have caused the cardiac
[52:13] arrest." Nonetheless, the doctor closed
[52:15] the
[52:17] bleeding and then she was then removed
[52:20] from uh the theater to the
[52:25] ICU. two three minutes in the
[52:29] ICU card arrest
[52:32] again but this
[52:34] time they could not resuscitate
[52:37] her and then that's when when I was home
[52:41] now I was I was at her
[52:43] place waiting for her because I knew she
[52:47] just went
[52:48] to to take out Gstone then she came back
[52:52] and then but the call that I
[52:55] got it was that she was not coming
[52:58] back. Well, I didn't know what to
[53:01] do. Should I cry? Should I
[53:05] faint? I just didn't know what to do. I
[53:07] just
[53:08] froze. And then they they had said to
[53:10] me, "You must come to the
[53:12] hospital." But I could not I didn't know
[53:14] how to start. Should I go? Should I not
[53:17] go? I just found myself meandering the
[53:20] same place over and over again.
[53:23] Amen. Amen. So that's how she she left
[53:26] us. But what comforted
[53:29] me because we had a lot of
[53:32] questions as to like
[53:34] why why because we did not see any
[53:37] signs. She was not
[53:40] sick. But
[53:42] then there's a scripture that came to
[53:44] life to me on that
[53:47] day because I sounded like I was
[53:49] questioning God too
[53:51] much. And then God said to me through
[53:55] the scripture, my thoughts are very
[54:00] far from your
[54:02] thoughts. I stopped
[54:05] questioning. I said, God, I still trust
[54:09] your
[54:10] will. So I'm saying to you,
[54:13] brethren, if you see us maybe
[54:16] crying, it is not because we are scared
[54:18] of
[54:19] death. We will miss our sister.
[54:23] They will miss their mother. They will
[54:25] miss their
[54:26] cousin. But I will tell you that glory
[54:30] to God,
[54:31] the one that we have
[54:34] received, he has
[54:36] promised that if you believe the way
[54:39] that I preach unto
[54:42] you, he shall not see death.
[54:45] So since then I told myself that my
[54:50] sister is not dead. My sister cannot
[54:54] die. She saved God with all her heart.
[54:59] She did not have money but she traveled
[55:02] all over the world with the
[55:03] pastor to an extent
[55:06] that people
[55:08] thought she had lot of money. I would I
[55:11] would I I used to ask
[55:15] her such a lot of money because I told
[55:19] people I tell people that I'm a
[55:22] businessman but not to her to her she
[55:26] would give me money for
[55:27] petrol sometimes she would come with a
[55:30] t-shirt that was my
[55:33] sister of all five of
[55:35] us because recently as we the
[55:39] preparations
[55:41] I just saw a
[55:44] pisley. I was
[55:46] like
[55:47] and but this person has had
[55:50] money. Then I remembered her way. I
[55:53] said, "Do people think I have
[55:55] money?" I said, "You do?" She said,
[55:58] "No." I said, "But where do you get all
[56:00] this money?" She said to quote
[56:05] her, "I also don't know. It's God who
[56:09] gives me." So my sister her
[56:14] generosity it's only that she did not
[56:16] have you know these millions that people
[56:19] has but should he had those millions I
[56:23] will tell you a world will be a better
[56:25] place you know now we can see that God
[56:28] is rewarding that
[56:32] generosity I'm going to tell something
[56:35] today it's it was supposed to be a
[56:37] secret But I am
[56:40] overwhelmed. You see the things that are
[56:42] happening
[56:43] here almost everything that we are doing
[56:47] today these
[56:49] preparations we are doing them almost
[56:51] out of
[56:54] nothing. If you ask me
[56:57] how I don't know now I know what you are
[57:02] saying I'm saying to you. You see these
[57:05] things, there's people who just come and
[57:08] offer because God is rewarding her
[57:14] generosity. But the greatest
[57:17] reward that she
[57:19] received, it was when she was crossing
[57:22] over. When she was crossing over, the
[57:26] last Sunday she attended
[57:28] service for some reasons. That day she
[57:31] was visible on the DVD.
[57:35] Everyone went talks to
[57:37] me. People from Cape
[57:40] Town, everywhere they say, "But we saw
[57:43] her on
[57:44] Sunday. It she was so visible. She was
[57:48] saying to us, "I am crossing over." On
[57:51] her way back, she was talking to her
[57:54] children. She asked them about three to
[57:57] four times. They will probablyify them
[57:59] tomorrow. Amen. She said to them, "Guys,
[58:03] did you
[58:04] hear
[58:06] preaching?" And then she would laugh,
[58:09] say, "And then she would drive for
[58:11] another maybe for a few kilometers, ask
[58:13] the same question
[58:15] again, preaching, she would drive few
[58:18] kilometers, ask the same question
[58:20] again." Then my my younger brother and I
[58:22] do miss when we revisit
[58:28] preaching said you must have a
[58:32] desire to change your
[58:35] body and I've seen that on my sister's
[58:39] face in the last weeks when my was was
[58:42] about to
[58:44] depart she became so sweet it was unlike
[58:48] her she was always smiling
[58:51] And I thank God through the sisters who
[58:53] chose these
[58:54] pictures because they resemble almost
[58:57] exactly how much was during this last
[59:01] day. She was so happy and then some see
[59:05] some people they saw on her
[59:09] statuses that she was beating
[59:11] farewell because the colleagues actually
[59:15] they came to
[59:17] her trying to reprimand her but no don't
[59:20] talk about death like
[59:22] that least did they
[59:25] know she was saying to them I'm leaving
[59:28] you so we are not shaken
[59:34] no
[59:35] power, no disease, no
[59:39] sickness, no death shall separate us
[59:43] from the love of God. Even if it means
[59:46] it be me
[59:47] tomorrow, I can guarantee
[59:50] you what our parents left
[59:53] us, what our pastor in invested in
[59:59] us, what the prophet brought to
[1:00:03] us. We are the living proof of that.
[1:00:07] We are not talking about the prophet
[1:00:09] that we that we
[1:00:11] know. The prophet that God has
[1:00:14] sent angel believe
[1:00:16] brother Angeli.
[1:00:20] They believe brotherham. We just don't
[1:00:23] believe that brother
[1:00:25] sent but we are the
[1:00:27] manifestation of that which the prophet
[1:00:31] has preached.
[1:00:33] We are the
[1:00:34] manifestation of that which our pastor
[1:00:37] is
[1:00:38] preaching. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:00:42] [Applause]
[1:01:02] She's young where she is today. Amen.
[1:01:05] So, we're going to rise. We have come to
[1:01:08] the very important moment of the word of
[1:01:11] God. Amen. So, we're going to rise. I'm
[1:01:14] not going to sing. I wanted to sing a
[1:01:16] song just for one
[1:01:18] minute for for

[1:12:42] [Music]
[1:12:49] I greet all the children of God
[1:12:53] this
[1:13:03] afternoon. Jesus
[1:13:08] Christ.
[1:13:10] Amen. I'm going to say I'm happy to be
[1:13:17] here because the Bible
[1:13:19] says precious in the sight of the
[1:13:24] Lord. Precious in the sight
[1:13:30] of is the death of his saints.
[1:13:36] When we have somebody who has passed
[1:13:42] away, then as children of
[1:13:48] God, we are not disappointed.
[1:13:55] We
[1:13:57] know. But while standing on our
[1:14:01] feet, my brother, let's read the book of
[1:14:08] Thessalonians, chapter
[1:14:11] 4. We read only verse
[1:14:16] 13. We are going to read the book of
[1:14:19] Romans,
[1:14:24] chapter 15 verse 4-5. 15 verse 4-
[1:14:34] 5 verse 13.
[1:14:37] Chapter 4 verse 13. Chapter 4:3 First.
[1:14:41] Yeah. But I would not have you to be
[1:14:44] ignorant, brethren, concerning them
[1:14:46] which are asleep. Amen. That ye sorrow
[1:14:49] not even as others which have no hope.
[1:14:52] Amen. Right. Romans
[1:14:55] chapter 15
[1:14:57] verse4 verse 4 and
[1:15:11] 5 for whatsoever
[1:15:14] thing for whatsoever things were written
[1:15:17] a four times were written for our
[1:15:21] learning that we thought that we through
[1:15:25] patience and comfort of the scriptures
[1:15:28] might have hope. Amen.
[1:15:32] Let's close our eyes.
[1:15:36] Mighty heavenly
[1:15:39] father. This is another chance once
[1:15:44] more granted to
[1:15:47] me by yourself. Amen.
[1:15:50] to stand in front of your children
[1:15:54] here to present something from
[1:15:58] you and to
[1:16:00] them at this time. Amen. Of brief
[1:16:04] bereiement. Yes.
[1:16:07] Heavenly Father,
[1:16:09] thank thank you very much Lord. And I'm
[1:16:13] really asking thee to come and take
[1:16:16] over. Amen. In the name of the Lord
[1:16:19] Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen. Amen. God
[1:16:23] bless you. You may take your seats.
[1:16:31] When things like this
[1:16:38] happen, we as children of
[1:16:44] God, we come
[1:16:47] and adise one another.
[1:16:55] Paul says here,
[1:16:58] I would not you
[1:17:02] have be
[1:17:08] ignorant concerning them which are
[1:17:14] asleep that he sorrow
[1:17:18] not even as
[1:17:22] others which have no hope.
[1:17:28] When
[1:17:29] we are here,
[1:17:34] when we go to church,
[1:17:38] when we worship,
[1:17:41] we have got
[1:17:43] hope. Amen.
[1:17:46] Then when things like this
[1:17:50] happen, we must tell people about our
[1:17:53] hope.
[1:17:59] People must know
[1:18:04] why we are doing things like
[1:18:07] this. Amen. Because we have got
[1:18:11] hope. Amen.
[1:18:14] The Bible says those which have been
[1:18:17] written
[1:18:21] before have written for
[1:18:25] us so that we can have
[1:18:32] hope. Because of
[1:18:36] that I want
[1:18:38] to tell you about four groups of people.
[1:18:45] on living on
[1:18:48] earth having their different
[1:18:56] destination after
[1:19:01] death because living here on
[1:19:07] earth we know that you are going to die.
[1:19:13] But what we don't know
[1:19:17] is when are we going to die
[1:19:20] and how are we going to
[1:19:23] die because death has no
[1:19:28] reason and death has no
[1:19:33] method. You can't
[1:19:37] say I'm going to die through accident.
[1:19:45] or I'm going to be
[1:19:47] killed. I'm going to be sick before I
[1:19:52] die. Our
[1:19:54] destinations, our
[1:19:58] destinations and we cannot cross
[1:20:02] them. But let me talk about these four
[1:20:05] groups of people.
[1:20:11] who have the different destination after
[1:20:14] death.
[1:20:19] These groups are here.
[1:20:24] You you belong to one of these
[1:20:28] groups. Then I want to tell you a
[1:20:30] destination.
[1:20:35] The first group
[1:20:38] are those who names are written in the
[1:20:41] lamb's book of
[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:20:43] [Applause]
[1:20:46] life. Amen.
[1:20:49] That book is also
[1:20:51] called the book of redemption.
[1:20:58] That is the first
[1:21:00] group. Their names are written there.
[1:21:06] Another
[1:21:08] group, their names are written in the
[1:21:11] book of
[1:21:15] life. Their names are written there.
[1:21:21] And the third
[1:21:23] group, their names were written in the
[1:21:25] lambs in the book of
[1:21:30] life, but they were removed.
[1:21:35] They were
[1:21:37] written, but they were removed.
[1:21:42] Perhaps they are
[1:21:46] here. Perhaps I will tell you why their
[1:21:49] names were removed.
[1:21:55] The last group, the fourth
[1:21:59] one, their names are not written in the
[1:22:02] in these two
[1:22:07] books. But they have got their own
[1:22:14] records, but not in the record of life.
[1:22:21] That is the fourth group.
[1:22:25] The first
[1:22:27] group they are called in different
[1:22:34] names. They are called the
[1:22:37] bride. They are called the
[1:22:40] saints. They are called the
[1:22:43] redeemed. They are called the royal seed
[1:22:46] of Abraham.
[1:22:49] Jesus called them his brethren.
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:55] That is the first group.
[1:23:00] The second
[1:23:03] group is called the foolish
[1:23:11] visions. They are
[1:23:13] called the righteous.
[1:23:18] And they are
[1:23:19] called God called them the blessed.
[1:23:27] That is the second
[1:23:31] group. The third and the fourth
[1:23:35] group they called the cast.
[1:23:44] Are you together with me? Amen.
[1:23:47] Amen. Just look where you are.
[1:23:55] This four different
[1:23:59] groups. The first one
[1:24:04] when they die,
[1:24:07] when we take this because this body,
[1:24:12] all of us, our bodies went to the
[1:24:19] grave. But
[1:24:22] you, you don't go to the grave.
[1:24:25] You are going to go to the grave.
[1:24:28] [Music]
[1:24:30] Whether you are the first group, the
[1:24:32] second group or the third
[1:24:35] [Music]
[1:24:36] group, when you die, your bodies go to
[1:24:38] the same place.
[1:24:44] But you are
[1:24:48] soul if you belong to the first
[1:24:53] group your soul goes to the sixth
[1:24:56] dimension
[1:24:58] dimension which is called the first
[1:25:04] heaven says I went
[1:25:08] there and he said Paul went to the third
[1:25:12] heaven
[1:25:14] He said he himself went to the
[1:25:18] fest and he said
[1:25:21] there I found the souls of the redeemed.
[1:25:30] Are you together?
[1:25:34] They this first group
[1:25:37] they qualify
[1:25:40] for the first resurrection.
[1:25:45] because you have got only two
[1:25:47] resurrections.
[1:25:51] This is this is the time
[1:25:54] for us to tell one
[1:25:58] another who we are
[1:26:01] and who you are.
[1:26:04] Amen. Yes, sir. We describe you. I
[1:26:09] describe you.
[1:26:12] Then you will see this is me
[1:26:18] because I'm I'm giving description.
[1:26:22] You will put yourself where you belong.
[1:26:30] When they die,
[1:26:32] they go to the sixth dimension dimension
[1:26:36] which is the first heaven.
[1:26:41] Bible says they are going to rest.
[1:26:49] They qualify
[1:26:51] for the first resurrection
[1:26:56] because we have got only two
[1:26:59] resurrection. We've got the first
[1:27:02] resurrection and the second
[1:27:04] resurrection and the first
[1:27:07] resurrection. Those who qualify for that
[1:27:11] resurrection is the only is this first
[1:27:14] group only.
[1:27:20] The last three,
[1:27:23] they qualify for the second
[1:27:25] resurrection.
[1:27:26] [Music]
[1:27:31] Just
[1:27:32] read Revelation
[1:27:38] 20:6 to show
[1:27:40] that we have got two resurrection.
[1:27:47] verse 6. Blessed and holy is he that
[1:27:51] have part in the first
[1:27:53] resurrection. On such the second death
[1:27:57] hath no power, but they shall be priests
[1:28:00] of God and of Christ. Amen. And shall
[1:28:04] reign with him a thousand years. When we
[1:28:08] talk about the first resurrection,
[1:28:12] this first group
[1:28:15] When living here on
[1:28:18] earth, they have already resurrected
[1:28:23] spiritually.
[1:28:25] Amen. If you are not
[1:28:28] resurrected, you will never be part of
[1:28:30] the first
[1:28:34] resurrection
[1:28:35] because by
[1:28:37] birth you die being dead.
[1:28:42] Sorry. You you you are you you are born
[1:28:45] being dead.
[1:28:48] The Bible
[1:28:50] says we are born in
[1:28:54] sin shaped in
[1:28:57] iniquity and came to the world speaking
[1:29:01] life. All of us whether you are the
[1:29:04] child of the
[1:29:07] saint but because of
[1:29:10] birth you are born a
[1:29:14] sinner. If you are a
[1:29:17] sinner you are born
[1:29:21] dead and you are born controlled from
[1:29:26] hell. Amen. And the Bible says,
[1:29:30] if you hear, if you hear, Jesus says, if
[1:29:33] you hear my
[1:29:35] word and believe on him who sent
[1:29:40] me, you move from
[1:29:44] death. Then you are transferred to
[1:29:47] life. In other words, when you hear the
[1:29:50] his
[1:29:51] word, you resurrect
[1:29:55] because you are dead.
[1:29:57] by birth. But when you hear his word,
[1:30:01] you resurrect.
[1:30:03] That's why the Bible says leave the
[1:30:07] dead to bury their
[1:30:09] dead. They must bury one
[1:30:12] another. Don't disturb them. Why do you
[1:30:16] interfere with
[1:30:17] them? Amen.
[1:30:20] But those who are resurrected,
[1:30:25] they must take the dead
[1:30:29] bodies to the grave because the owner of
[1:30:33] the
[1:30:34] body is not dead.
[1:30:39] Amen. He he had
[1:30:42] resurrected. Then those who have been
[1:30:45] resurrected already now
[1:30:49] they will qualify for the first
[1:30:58] resurrection. This one, this this
[1:31:03] resurrection is a a a supernatural
[1:31:11] resurrection. is not a physical one,
[1:31:16] but another
[1:31:18] one. It's going to be a physical
[1:31:23] one because they will move from the
[1:31:27] sixth
[1:31:29] dimension and come down here.
[1:31:33] take
[1:31:34] bodies which is called the the the
[1:31:37] glorified
[1:31:40] bodies and they those who are still
[1:31:44] living because they they are already
[1:31:46] resurrected
[1:31:49] themselves they will get out of these
[1:31:52] bodies. They will change these bodies.
[1:31:55] his bodies will just
[1:31:57] vanish and they will take another
[1:32:00] body which is the
[1:32:03] [Music]
[1:32:05] glorified and and be raptured
[1:32:10] and meet Jesus in the sky.
[1:32:16] Are you together with me? I'm talking
[1:32:18] about the first group.
[1:32:24] Because when you
[1:32:25] die, you go to your
[1:32:31] own. No one is not going to his
[1:32:39] own. When you die, you go through your
[1:32:43] own. Hallelujah.
[1:32:47] If you are born again,
[1:32:49] you go to those who are born
[1:32:53] again. Amen. Because they they belong to
[1:32:56] the first group.
[1:32:59] They are the real the real seed of
[1:33:04] Abraham. If you are the royal seed of
[1:33:06] Abraham here
[1:33:09] now, when you die, you go to the royal
[1:33:13] seed of Abraham.
[1:33:16] And if you are not the royal seed of
[1:33:19] Abraham, if you are not born
[1:33:21] again, why do we born
[1:33:24] again? Because we are born in
[1:33:28] sin. Our first birth is
[1:33:33] death. Then we must get out of
[1:33:37] that and be born again.
[1:33:40] And we know to be born
[1:33:42] again it must come by a
[1:33:46] seat and the seat travels through the
[1:33:51] body from the boot to another
[1:33:53] body. The seat is the word of God. The
[1:33:57] Bible says you are born by the the
[1:34:03] seed which is not corrupted.
[1:34:09] Which is the word of God.
[1:34:11] Then the word of God moves through the
[1:34:14] body
[1:34:18] to the body.
[1:34:23] Then if you have not receive all let me
[1:34:26] stop there. I shall come back.
[1:34:30] I was saying when you die you go to your
[1:34:34] own
[1:34:39] read Psalm 49 there 49
[1:34:45] I think you will read verse 16 verse 16
[1:34:50] yeah Psalm 49 verse 16 I think so Psalm
[1:34:54] 49 verse 16
[1:35:01] Yeah. Verse 16 to 19. Just read it. 19
[1:35:05] 16
[1:35:10] 19. Psalms 49
[1:35:13] 16. Be not thou afraid when one is made
[1:35:17] rich, when the glory of his house is
[1:35:20] increased. For when he shall carry
[1:35:24] nothing away, his glory shall not desend
[1:35:28] after
[1:35:29] him. Though while he lived, he bless his
[1:35:32] soul, and men will praise thee. When
[1:35:36] thou does well to
[1:35:38] thyself, he shall go to the
[1:35:41] generation of his fathers. They shall
[1:35:44] never see light. Amen. You see where his
[1:35:48] fathers are.
[1:35:52] They are in
[1:35:54] darkness and darkness is in
[1:35:58] hell. In other words, his
[1:36:01] fathers, they are in hell. And when this
[1:36:06] man
[1:36:07] die, he must go to his
[1:36:09] father. That's why I say you go to your
[1:36:15] own. Amen.
[1:36:18] You you are born in
[1:36:23] darkness even though you say you are in
[1:36:26] light because light is the word of
[1:36:29] God. But when you are outside of the
[1:36:33] word of
[1:36:34] God by birth all of
[1:36:37] us we are born in
[1:36:40] darkness. We are born controlled
[1:36:45] there. Amen.
[1:36:48] Guess why? When a child is still small,
[1:36:52] but when when a child is born,
[1:36:55] the mother say he he's
[1:37:00] angry bite this mother's priest.
[1:37:08] He say he is he is angry.
[1:37:13] When he steal a little baby start to
[1:37:20] steal when you come he put his sense
[1:37:25] back. Why is born in
[1:37:29] sin? He's a thief. He's born being a
[1:37:33] thief. He's been being a liar.
[1:37:41] He had to be born again.
[1:37:46] When he's when he's there, when he is
[1:37:49] there,
[1:37:51] he is in darkness.
[1:37:54] When when he died, he just went where he
[1:37:58] is.
[1:38:00] Because living here on
[1:38:03] earth, we are controlled from different
[1:38:05] places.
[1:38:08] And you are control from where you
[1:38:11] are. When you hear the word, you move
[1:38:14] from a place to a
[1:38:18] place. When you hear the word of God,
[1:38:21] you have a a connection
[1:38:24] with the place where you
[1:38:27] are because you when you are born again,
[1:38:30] you go to where God
[1:38:33] is. Then when you die, you go to where
[1:38:38] you
[1:38:41] are. Because when you are not, you are
[1:38:44] here and not born
[1:38:46] again. You are controlled from
[1:38:50] below from the fifth
[1:38:54] dimension. That's why you you are
[1:38:58] connected with the wishes.
[1:39:04] When the that's
[1:39:06] why let me tell you
[1:39:11] man is a tune being
[1:39:20] his
[1:39:21] body
[1:39:23] soul
[1:39:25] spirit when you die all these things
[1:39:28] separate
[1:39:33] The body went to the grave. Grave.
[1:39:40] If you are the child of God,
[1:39:43] your
[1:39:44] spirit went to God.
[1:39:47] Your
[1:39:48] soul went to the sixth dimension.
[1:39:52] Tell
[1:39:53] me, if you're not a child of
[1:39:56] God, your body went to the
[1:40:00] grave. Where is your spirit?
[1:40:05] Amen. Your soul will go to hell.
[1:40:12] Your spirit will just move all around
[1:40:14] you.
[1:40:19] If you
[1:40:20] are you died in the hospital,
[1:40:25] your spirit will be there
[1:40:28] in the hospital.
[1:40:31] Your spirit Wow.
[1:40:34] All right. The prophet told the prophet
[1:40:38] told me like that.
[1:40:41] He said the man
[1:40:44] was hit by the
[1:40:48] car and died there.
[1:40:52] Another man
[1:40:55] came hid the same man
[1:41:01] because the spirit of that man is there.
[1:41:06] The wishes will use the
[1:41:10] spirit to bewish
[1:41:13] you. Then you see your
[1:41:16] father because they've taken the spirit
[1:41:19] of your father.
[1:41:21] They even can take the soul of your
[1:41:24] father.
[1:41:27] But because your the soul of your father
[1:41:29] is tormented
[1:41:33] there, they use the spirit of your
[1:41:40] father. Are you together with let me go
[1:41:43] where I'm going.
[1:41:45] The second
[1:41:47] group I said they are the foolish
[1:41:52] [Music]
[1:41:54] visions. They are called the
[1:41:58] blessed. They have got they qualify for
[1:42:01] the second
[1:42:04] resurrection. In the second
[1:42:07] resurrection, they called the
[1:42:11] blessed because Jesus
[1:42:13] said, the Bible says
[1:42:16] there in Matthew chapter 25,
[1:42:20] he said, "Come ye blessed of my father."
[1:42:27] He was tooken to the foolish
[1:42:31] vision, the
[1:42:33] Russians, the second
[1:42:36] group who are written in the book of
[1:42:41] life. He said, "Come ye blessed of my
[1:42:45] father, but it is during the second
[1:42:47] resurrection."
[1:42:50] He said because I was in
[1:42:54] hospital and you came and see me
[1:43:00] hungry you fed me.
[1:43:04] They said who we didn't see you
[1:43:07] there. He said when you were doing
[1:43:10] that to the list of these
[1:43:15] brethren, who are those
[1:43:20] brethren? They are the first group.
[1:43:26] Are you together?
[1:43:28] when you that's why you must not
[1:43:34] hate because he he said to the the the
[1:43:37] other
[1:43:40] group he said come we cast
[1:43:47] because I was in hospitalally
[1:43:50] you didn't come and see me
[1:43:54] they are thrown into the lake of
[1:43:59] because of their
[1:44:03] hatred. If you hate
[1:44:07] one of the
[1:44:09] brethren or one of the royal seed of
[1:44:15] Abraham, you send yourself to
[1:44:19] hell. Even if you
[1:44:23] say I am the bread,
[1:44:28] You will just be
[1:44:30] talking you have you have reason
[1:44:32] yourself to
[1:44:35] have God is
[1:44:38] love. There is no hatred in
[1:44:41] God. If you don't love me as your
[1:44:45] brother love me as your your
[1:44:50] enemy because the Bible says love your
[1:44:53] enemy.
[1:44:56] There is no hatred in God
[1:44:59] there. You don't have reason to hate
[1:45:03] somebody. If you
[1:45:06] hate, you are the
[1:45:12] cast. You are not giving a foolish
[1:45:16] vision. I swear,
[1:45:22] you are the cast.
[1:45:29] Even if you can sing the whole
[1:45:32] night, even if you can
[1:45:35] fast and go to the mountain and come
[1:45:39] back and speak in
[1:45:43] tongues, but you are the cast.
[1:45:52] That is the third the second
[1:45:56] group. The second group are the blessed
[1:46:01] because they loved the
[1:46:07] brethren. For them to
[1:46:10] qualify is only because they loved the
[1:46:15] brethren
[1:46:17] only not because they fasted.
[1:46:20] Not because they they they were not they
[1:46:22] were not
[1:46:24] prostitute. Not because they were not
[1:46:26] drunkard. There is no
[1:46:29] such because you love your
[1:46:32] brethren. Come here the blessed
[1:46:39] father. Some were
[1:46:41] there with good
[1:46:44] works. They were
[1:46:47] waiting. If they call that one
[1:46:50] when it comes my time you'll
[1:46:55] see he said you I don't know
[1:47:00] you said but hey I I I I am that great
[1:47:06] preacher I don't know
[1:47:10] you the one who was was healing the
[1:47:13] people there raising the
[1:47:16] dead in the name in your
[1:47:19] him. I don't know you. You hated the
[1:47:23] brethren.
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:29] You You have done that by hating the
[1:47:38] brethren with great
[1:47:45] works, fasting,
[1:47:47] praying,
[1:47:49] doing miracles,
[1:47:52] singing,
[1:47:54] preaching, mighty preachers,
[1:48:01] I don't know you.
[1:48:09] This
[1:48:10] is the fourth, the third and the fourth
[1:48:13] group.
[1:48:17] They
[1:48:18] also qualify for the second
[1:48:21] resurrection.
[1:48:25] The second the second
[1:48:28] group, the third group and the the
[1:48:31] fourth group. They all qualify for the
[1:48:34] second
[1:48:37] result because there is only one
[1:48:41] group which qualify for the first.
[1:48:46] is the
[1:48:49] bride.
[1:48:50] Amen. They are the ones who are written
[1:48:53] in the
[1:48:57] lamp. They are the ones who belong to
[1:49:01] the
[1:49:03] lamb. They are the
[1:49:06] redeemed. Amen.
[1:49:10] When the lamb died on the cross,
[1:49:15] It was it was been killed for
[1:49:18] them. He shed this blood for
[1:49:23] them because because of
[1:49:26] birth they came this
[1:49:29] way. Then he
[1:49:31] came to buy them back. Praise God.
[1:49:38] To come back to go to where they were
[1:49:41] from the beginning.
[1:49:44] They came here because of birth. It was
[1:49:49] not their place. Because that's the
[1:49:51] reason when they hear the
[1:49:54] word, he was speaking with
[1:49:57] them. That's why it is written in the
[1:50:00] Bible. So that when I come, I must read
[1:50:04] there.
[1:50:05] Oh, Jesus said to
[1:50:07] me, I'm going to prepare
[1:50:12] you the place.
[1:50:16] Amen.
[1:50:17] Praise God. And he is telling you
[1:50:20] also. I'm going to prepare
[1:50:22] you a place. And if you want, that place
[1:50:27] can be
[1:50:29] yours. If you want that place, you just
[1:50:32] receive his way.
[1:50:35] How can they receive my
[1:50:38] ways? If there is no
[1:50:40] preacher, how can he preach? If he's not
[1:50:45] sent, every now and
[1:50:48] then, every
[1:50:51] dispensation, every age, every
[1:50:54] generation, God has his
[1:50:59] man. Amen.
[1:51:02] so that that man can talk with the
[1:51:06] people. God has to come in
[1:51:11] flesh. So because his children are in
[1:51:15] flesh so that he can talk to in
[1:51:21] flesh when he's in flesh when they are
[1:51:24] in flesh they can talk
[1:51:27] together. He he he he called your
[1:51:31] brother. He called your brother so that
[1:51:34] he can send your
[1:51:35] brother to
[1:51:38] you. He don't come in as an
[1:51:41] angel. He don't come as a spirit. He
[1:51:45] don't just send a
[1:51:47] voice, but he send your
[1:51:50] brother to you to talk to you. And if
[1:51:54] you listen to your brother, you listen
[1:51:57] to him. He said to them, if they don't
[1:52:01] hear you, then they will never hear
[1:52:03] me. Amen. Do you remember that man? He
[1:52:08] said to Abraham, Abraham, Abraham,
[1:52:12] Abraham,
[1:52:14] I still have my brothers
[1:52:17] there. Can you go
[1:52:19] there and tell
[1:52:21] them so that they may not come to where
[1:52:23] I
[1:52:25] am? He
[1:52:27] said, Moses and the
[1:52:30] prophets are there. If they don't hear
[1:52:33] them, even if I can send an angel from
[1:52:36] here,
[1:52:39] was never here.
[1:52:46] May you together with us here.
[1:52:51] This second group,
[1:52:54] their
[1:52:55] destination is the new Jerusalem.
[1:53:01] because they are part of the first
[1:53:07] group. But by
[1:53:11] predestination, they were just taken
[1:53:15] out. That's why they call them the
[1:53:18] visions.
[1:53:20] They they they
[1:53:22] they come out
[1:53:25] there being vig all of
[1:53:28] them but their
[1:53:30] problem these other
[1:53:33] visions they have
[1:53:36] oil
[1:53:38] others have oil but they are the the
[1:53:42] same
[1:53:45] group. Are you together?
[1:53:49] They they don't have a rapturing faith.
[1:53:55] They have got
[1:53:56] faith but not the rapturing
[1:54:00] faith. Amen. The rapturing seven
[1:54:06] thunders will give the
[1:54:10] bride a rapturing faith.
[1:54:15] The
[1:54:16] revelation of those seven
[1:54:19] thunders is the one that will give the
[1:54:24] plan. Amen. Amen. They are there. After
[1:54:30] after after everything has been done,
[1:54:35] there was only one thing,
[1:54:38] a white
[1:54:39] [Music]
[1:54:41] stone in that
[1:54:43] pyramid which was not
[1:54:47] interpreted. But it had to be
[1:54:51] interpreted because it is there. It is
[1:54:54] part of the whole thing.
[1:54:57] Everything has been interpreted.
[1:55:00] Only this one.
[1:55:02] [Music]
[1:55:04] The interpretation of that word will
[1:55:07] give the bride that is that is the only
[1:55:11] difference
[1:55:13] there. Amen. Because when we get to that
[1:55:17] one now he said now stay
[1:55:20] here. Look
[1:55:23] inside. Amen. I must go
[1:55:27] west. When he come back from west, he
[1:55:31] said now I come with the
[1:55:35] interpretation. Where is that
[1:55:38] interpretation? It was not with him. It
[1:55:41] was in
[1:55:42] him. Amen.
[1:55:45] All right. Let me let me not go there.
[1:55:50] I want to show you the
[1:55:53] difference of these
[1:55:56] vict brothers they are just like one
[1:55:59] cloth.
[1:56:03] The owner the owner went to the
[1:56:07] shop and he choose among the cross
[1:56:12] there type of a
[1:56:14] cloth. If it is it was red all of it.
[1:56:20] He took that
[1:56:22] cloth and he put it on the on the on the
[1:56:25] table
[1:56:26] there, the same
[1:56:28] cloth. He he has chosen it because he
[1:56:32] loved that
[1:56:33] cloth. But there comes the the pen.
[1:56:38] Now the
[1:56:41] Caesar the Caesar moves through the
[1:56:46] pen. It is the the the nation which
[1:56:49] moved
[1:56:52] the then out he took out the
[1:56:57] pattern the same the the the whole cloth
[1:57:00] remain on the table
[1:57:02] there then he took the the pattern and
[1:57:06] he used the pattern for what he
[1:57:08] wanted. After using the pattern now he
[1:57:11] went back to that table because that
[1:57:14] cloth he
[1:57:16] liked he has chosen it then he he take
[1:57:19] the the remaining
[1:57:21] one make something out of it after the
[1:57:26] burden it's the
[1:57:29] same predestination
[1:57:35] separated that's why their destination
[1:57:37] is the
[1:57:40] is the new
[1:57:41] Jerusalem. But these ones they are
[1:57:44] outside the
[1:57:49] city. The first group
[1:57:52] inside this group is outside. They are
[1:57:56] tillers of the
[1:57:58] soil. outside.
[1:58:02] The second, the the the third and the
[1:58:06] fourth, their
[1:58:08] destination is the league of
[1:58:11] [Music]
[1:58:15] fire. The third and the
[1:58:18] fourth, those who were written and
[1:58:23] removed. Those who were
[1:58:26] removed, they were removed be
[1:58:30] because they hated the
[1:58:35] brethren. If you hate the
[1:58:39] brethren, Judas was
[1:58:43] removed because he hated Jesus.
[1:58:52] Firstly, they was told
[1:58:56] Don't rejoice because he was I I think
[1:58:59] he was the one who was making a noise
[1:59:04] there. I I I prayed for the
[1:59:07] sick. I've driven the
[1:59:09] [Music]
[1:59:11] demons. Don't be don't don't be don't
[1:59:13] rejoice over
[1:59:15] that. Rejoice because your
[1:59:19] names written in heaven.
[1:59:22] Judas was there. His name was there but
[1:59:26] it was removed
[1:59:32] because of
[1:59:35] hatred praying with the pastor,
[1:59:38] hating the pastor
[1:59:41] and sold the
[1:59:46] pastor. If I'm people talking about the
[1:59:48] pastor
[1:59:51] there. Yeah, I know that pastor. It's
[1:59:54] just like
[1:59:59] that. Do you want to do you want him?
[2:00:03] I I can give me 30 cent. 30 cent.
[2:00:09] He said, "Yes, we'll give you 30 cent."
[2:00:13] Okay. Thank you.
[2:00:24] the destination. Read read revelation
[2:00:27] chapter
[2:00:29] 20 and see from
[2:00:32] verse 11.
[2:00:38] Destination of this
[2:00:41] this third and fourth
[2:00:47] Revelation
[2:00:50] 20:1 And I saw a great white throne and
[2:00:53] him that sat on it, from whose face the
[2:00:56] earth and the heaven fled away. And
[2:01:00] there was found no place for them. And I
[2:01:03] saw the dead, small and great, stand
[2:01:06] before God, and the books were opened.
[2:01:09] And another book was opened, which is
[2:01:12] the book of life. And the dead were
[2:01:14] judged out of those things which were
[2:01:17] written in the books according to their
[2:01:20] works. And the sea gave up the dead
[2:01:24] which were in it. And death and hell
[2:01:27] delivered up the dead which were in
[2:01:29] them. And they were judged every man
[2:01:32] according to their works. And death and
[2:01:35] hell were cast into the lake of fire.
[2:01:38] This is the second death.
[2:01:41] This is the second
[2:01:47] death. Why second death? Where is the
[2:01:50] first
[2:01:52] one? You are born
[2:01:57] dead. This is the
[2:02:00] second. Because you upon
[2:02:03] death, you are
[2:02:05] [Music]
[2:02:07] dead. Because God is
[2:02:11] life. When you accept
[2:02:14] God, you accept the
[2:02:18] life. In the beginning was the
[2:02:21] way. The word was with God. And the word
[2:02:25] was God. And the word was made
[2:02:28] flesh. And those who receive
[2:02:31] him, they were given
[2:02:34] power to become the children of God.
[2:02:41] Books were opened.
[2:02:45] These are books of
[2:02:51] sinners. The death were
[2:02:55] judged. They were they are standing
[2:02:57] there.
[2:03:00] dead.
[2:03:03] Those who are going to be judged are the
[2:03:08] dead. You cannot judge the
[2:03:13] living. You judge the
[2:03:17] dead. When we say some someone is dead
[2:03:20] is because he doesn't have the word of
[2:03:23] God in him, doesn't have life in him.
[2:03:28] and life is
[2:03:32] God. He said now books were
[2:03:36] open. You see if you are a
[2:03:41] wish you come there with
[2:03:49] your because they are your
[2:03:54] books. If you are a
[2:03:59] mother, you come with all people you
[2:04:04] murdered. You are going to murder them
[2:04:07] at the judgment.
[2:04:10] Then study the first one.
[2:04:14] Second killing made the judgment because
[2:04:17] it it is something
[2:04:23] like it is it is. Yeah. It is bring
[2:04:27] something which has been has been done
[2:04:31] there back here so that you can see what
[2:04:36] you have done from when you are still a
[2:04:40] boy when stealing a
[2:04:43] sugar coming up
[2:04:45] there. When you become
[2:04:48] older, when you start to do what you
[2:04:52] do, you come come
[2:04:55] up until you
[2:04:59] die. That is your
[2:05:02] book. The books will be
[2:05:04] open. But these books are for the the
[2:05:10] fourth and the third.
[2:05:16] Not the first and the
[2:05:19] second. They are not
[2:05:21] here. Here they are the fourth
[2:05:25] group and the third group. They are
[2:05:28] standing
[2:05:29] here with their
[2:05:33] works. Even those who were praying for
[2:05:36] the sick coming, they will do that.
[2:05:38] There's judgment there.
[2:05:46] And the first
[2:05:48] group will be there looking at them.
[2:05:53] Yeah, they are being it.
[2:05:58] Because they are
[2:06:03] judges. Amen. I'm standing here
[2:06:07] today as a judge.
[2:06:15] If you don't know,
[2:06:17] I'm telling you
[2:06:22] these words
[2:06:24] are going to judge you.
[2:06:28] One of the good days.
[2:06:33] That is where we that is what we are.
[2:06:39] That is our hope.
[2:06:44] Those who don't believe,
[2:06:47] they believe when they die,
[2:06:51] they are going to have power.
[2:06:54] They're going to be like him. They going
[2:06:56] to be gods,
[2:06:59] ancestors and men.
[2:07:03] But how how are how long are they going
[2:07:06] to be ancestors?
[2:07:13] Why do they get power when they are
[2:07:19] dead? But the Bible
[2:07:21] says even the old
[2:07:24] people who didn't worship God
[2:07:31] They would tell us they were used to
[2:07:32] tell us they said God will see
[2:07:38] you. They knew
[2:07:40] that if you don't do
[2:07:43] well, God doesn't love
[2:07:46] you. They will say if you're a
[2:07:50] ghost, they say God has has has chased
[2:07:53] you away.
[2:08:01] They say they know they knew that they
[2:08:03] will not be ancestors
[2:08:07] forever. They knew that there will come
[2:08:09] a time where they will be they have to
[2:08:12] be judged. The only thing which which
[2:08:14] has got the truth. Amen.
[2:08:18] Is the word of God.
[2:08:24] You live here.
[2:08:28] You die being
[2:08:32] living. That's why we say you are
[2:08:37] asleep. Blessed are the
[2:08:41] dead who die in
[2:08:46] Christ. You die in
[2:08:50] Christ because in
[2:08:52] Christ you get
[2:08:55] there because you are part of him.
[2:09:01] If you are not part of him, you'll never
[2:09:04] be
[2:09:05] there. Amen. You become
[2:09:08] part because you can hear the
[2:09:11] way and you can
[2:09:15] distinguish because
[2:09:17] among many
[2:09:20] ways. The the ichless could choose among
[2:09:24] many
[2:09:30] voices the
[2:09:33] voice of his mother.
[2:09:38] The child of God can choose among many
[2:09:43] ways the word of God.
[2:09:47] God bless you.
[2:09:50] Amen. Praise God.
[2:09:55] The only thing which can comfort
[2:10:00] us is
[2:10:02] life and life is
[2:10:06] God. If we live here with
[2:10:10] life, we are comforted.
[2:10:14] You cannot comfort somebody by a
[2:10:19] lie because when time goes
[2:10:22] on, he will realize that that man was
[2:10:26] telling me a
[2:10:28] lie. Then he will feel
[2:10:31] bad. But if you tell somebody the
[2:10:35] truth, the truth will remain the
[2:10:40] truth. One day he will realize
[2:10:43] that that man was telling me the truth
[2:10:46] and the truth is the word of
[2:10:49] God. The word of God will console you.
[2:10:53] Amen.
[2:10:55] God is the only man who can
[2:11:01] console. No man, no social worker. No,
[2:11:07] no, no man.
[2:11:10] God
[2:11:11] only. He's the
[2:11:13] consoler. And if we want him to console
[2:11:18] us, we just go next to
[2:11:22] him and he will accept
[2:11:25] us. God bless you. Let's close our eyes.
[2:11:29] [Applause]
[2:11:33] Thank you, pastors.
[2:11:38] Let's close our eyes and pray.
[2:11:41] Mighty heavenly father.
[2:11:45] You loved us so
[2:11:47] much that you left your position
[2:11:52] as the great almighty God
[2:11:56] and came down and took the form of his
[2:11:58] son. Amen. So that you can come and die
[2:12:02] for sons.
[2:12:04] sons which were you which were with you
[2:12:07] before the foundation of the world. You
[2:12:10] love the world. The Bible says so. Love
[2:12:14] the world so
[2:12:15] much so that each and everyone who is
[2:12:20] living on earth can be saved by hearing
[2:12:24] your word. Amen. Bless the people who
[2:12:27] are
[2:12:28] here. Take the word which was spoken
[2:12:32] here. Amen. put it in each and
[2:12:35] everyone's heart. Amen. So that when we
[2:12:38] leave here, we can go and meditate
[2:12:43] upon what we have had. Amen. Bless the
[2:12:47] family. Yes. Console them. Amen. You are
[2:12:51] the only consoler. Amen. I pray Lord in
[2:12:56] the name of the Lord and Sior Jesus
[2:12:59] Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
