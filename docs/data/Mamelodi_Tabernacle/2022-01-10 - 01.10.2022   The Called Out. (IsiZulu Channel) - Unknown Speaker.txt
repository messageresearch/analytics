cheese edges so it's bridge on the 12 5 54. we shall live in the paragraph for 21st up to 24. just two or ah to attach your mind in what we are here for amen the prophet says he said now in this it's to my humble believer that we are living in the closing days of the world history I want to make that real clear you see it was a prophecy you want to make it clear that we are living in the closing of the history of living a Godly life according to the message that he will give you life today we are seeing Christianity it has so much challenges they are living like a there's no promise of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ people are living the way it pleases them at the end they say that a believer of entire message at the end they are saying that they are Christians but what they are reflecting is something else Hallelujah oh the prophet Kevin said he said and every Kingdom my hope is built on nothing else than Jesus blood and the righteousness All Around My Soul give away he is All My Hope and staying on Christ's the solid rock as 10 all other ground is seeking sin amen [Music] the only place the only safe place is in Christ Hallelujah the only safe places so all of us we need to be sure that we are in there oh Jesus let me read one quotation and our pastor will come Hallelujah in the preaching they called out that is even our title when there is trouble in the world when people are getting distracted God is peace calling is all Hallelujah God is calling his own Hallelujah so the prophet says it's preached on the 9th January 28th paragraph 10 but I will read and down there see it seems to me [Music] feeling this great pressure coming on should go to safety everything is complete nothing works life is so expensive this and that but we need to go to the safety Place amen when nothing was working in Egypt Israel had a safety please Hallelujah oh thanks God they don't do it did what did want to listen though the warning voice of God speaks it day after day night after night but men desires to live in sin people are getting used with the end timer message and that message is not a Pentecostal Church this is not a Pentecostal Church well [Music] and the message is something above everything that we can find in the world a message that is a message that is perfecting the bride of Christ a message that making us to be ready for the tea coming day amen the prophet said people will hear the warning but they won't [Music] when people they don't listen now we are going but the stubborn seed they start stubbornness until they face the first one that was kind when God told him hey sin is laying at your door do height and I will be with you God give him the advice to do [Music] but he never listened because he was not the seed of hallelujah oh thanks God [Music] that's why we need to be awake to know who we are say you know it's later than we think people think that they got plenty of time but the scripture declared it's later than we think Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah and the days of Lord so shall it be in the coming of the son of God amen that prophecy we have seen it fulfilled what was happening in the time of Noah what was happening in the time of Sodom and come we saw it happening [Music] but people they are still sleeping they think that we've got plenty times no there's no more time it's later then we think amen it's a calling to Awakening it's a calling to be ready if you are not yet ready led to this time make you to be ready you don't have time to distract yourself you never know as I say if we're gonna finish this meeting Hallelujah all the prophecy it's been fulfilled it's always been fulfilled amen okay so we're gonna sing something then the pastor will come and they will Minister for us the way amen so God bless you so much sir and the bless the word of the night that will keep us in the spirit of the Lord [Music] my brother come and give something that the pastor like then we can sing it alone

he spoke about something which is an outstanding [Applause] especially in these days you know we all know that the Lord is coming there signs are there and that's why I always say I'm not addressing The Message Church I'm addressing the variety there can be so many messages but what do we need to address is the bride of Christ [Applause] you know brother Branham used to go we used to go out and he would say that when coming to the Mysteries he would say well this is for the church back home the Mysteries then I said he was not referring to Brenham Tabernacles no he was referring to the bride of Christ [Applause] you are a man okay thank you as I'm watching the wrist watch here God bless you our pastor amen and we really love you and what you stand for and the flock here again where are

foreign song and because we are studying today we will continue tomorrow they're called out all right it started back there with Abraham is to treat a city IA English as it was the Seed of Abraham Junior see no power the sign of Abraham the people who have met Melchizedek and maybe I will ask a question how many of us forgive us they ask for a brother to interpret in vernacular because [Music] we have even friends overseas and elsewhere all right now we are going to read the scriptures and I believe God foreign if there was any coming of the Lord you you listen to this one here can we just stand up for the reading of the word singers you know even in the office then he has enough say Obviously yeah the pastor was just saying some things of which leaving that office I already had something more than what I heard and I could see what the pasta stands for this so I'm going to this scripture even To Us by our pastor yes all right you've got it brother we paid him for it look that's chapter 17 verse let's start from where they ask you 17. about the kingdom of God with Zulu let's bow our heads in prayer our heavenly father another afternoon it's so wonderful to be with your children here their offspring the people whom you have alone before the foundation of the world their attributes said the prophet that at the end of time their attributes will do the same thing just like what Abraham did he met a man but Abraham knew that the man was Melchizedek because he could see beyond the curtain of time and now the prophet says it will happen again when the sons of God the sons of the the key the Seed of Abraham which is Christ in this at this point in time the Seed of Abraham is here again they will do the very same thing that Abraham did they will see things the way Abraham saw them they will meet Melchizedek they wave Abraham met him only the seed we are so thankful father as we open these scriptures We Believe father you are here with us to talk to us the Seed of Abraham thank you as we open the scriptures and father We Believe even a sick person here will leave this place holy because your word is a Healer and that we believe father the word that is here

unveiling of God preach 11 and paragraph 68. notice okay the first as the prophet yes his own crucified him he came as the son of man to write not the Son of God then after the Holy Spirit came number one amen of God he came as the son of man who is the holy spirit because God is a spirit because the seven churches were made by the spirit oh yeah it is in the book you're saying what the blasphemia's name Blasphemous names serve the holy ghosts that's why it says what the spirit says to the church but now we are no longer in the church age [Music] is the age as I have read this year was that book again my brother the age this age that we are living in is okay then it says and the son of man himself in the same power that he was it through justification sanctification and all these things the Son of God the spirit so the church ages came through the Holy Spirit says beyond that is the son of man let us read here okay [Music] foreign it has had to come back now the son of man a prophet a prophet the Son of God the spirit the son of David foreign [Music] and also page 12 the unveiling of God page 12. we've got this part also yet paragraph 73 paragraphs I read this part here and it says now eating uh and what does he do now returned as the son of man when he was crucified he was the son of foreign he became the son of God throughout the church ages but now after the seven churches [Music] we are after the church age [Applause] [Music] [Applause] to Rebecca one letter is but when Rebecca could see Isaacs Isaac was led Rebecca until Rebecca could see Isaac Rebecca Isaac amen amen so the prophet will lead the people until uh but when the time arrives in your book and what is the original seat then he says what now here is the secret is now here's he he brought the weight like eliasa to the bride who later is we now couldn't believe until she she could now see Isaac all right he took him right exactly at the right time when the seals open actually he said let us go and pass what is time the seals are open now you can go up past the weight is now in the price now if the word is in Rebecca um [Applause] [Music] and so I read here and what does he do we are now with 10 as son of man the Seven Seas see seven seeds yes we tend to us and then from that son of David and then the son of man Son of God he he is revealed in the last days [Music] not the son of a hand of God because the Son of God is the spirit [Music] the son of God is the spirit and what is the son of man so the son of man the son of God this in our day now we are beyond the church ages did you know yeah I'm not in any church age because I'm we we are beyond that nobody it's now the revelation of the seven series is the seventh seal you know the Bible says when he opened one of the seals because that opens the seals [Applause] now that's why the people to say it is [Music] this book the rapture I'm standing in the gap the Angels Came pick me up some Tata where to the Mississippi went West to do what Zion is they took me now if you talking about the Angels took me like this even the angels that came to him and yeah he came to him you know he says did these angels came straight

seven still open that angel came and that is the seventh seeds that's what he says amen amen then you go back again still reveal my power is something the angel came straight to me and that was the
