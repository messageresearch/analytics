[1:33:45] you always know our heart desire
[1:33:50] sometimes as human beings
[1:33:53] we may think otherwise but you know
[1:33:55] better
[1:33:57] right in the midst of what we call is a
[1:34:00] confusion
[1:34:01] that's where we see you better
[1:34:03] that's where we know who you are
[1:34:08] may you comfort us Heavenly Father
[1:34:11] may you look down deep into our hearts
[1:34:15] for we know nothing has just happened
[1:34:18] for we know you purposed everything
[1:34:21] before the foundation of this world we
[1:34:25] are just walking upon the path we have
[1:34:27] already prepared Lord
[1:34:29] there's nothing wrong with anything you
[1:34:32] know better
[1:34:35] bless each and every individual today
[1:34:38] for this day
[1:34:41] you know the message we have just look
[1:34:43] at the message we are just written
[1:34:47] was purpose for this day
[1:34:50] many can think this and this could have
[1:34:53] happened
[1:34:54] this could have been done but Lord God
[1:34:58] we are just a Living Sacrifice before
[1:35:01] thee
[1:35:03] we are just a vessel Heavenly Father
[1:35:06] that you use
[1:35:08] and every decision that has been taken
[1:35:10] it is because you knew heavenly father
[1:35:13] will be that way
[1:35:15] Lord God we pray again and we shall pray
[1:35:19] ever and ever that each and every step
[1:35:22] we take in our life may it just not be a
[1:35:26] step but it is a step that is coming
[1:35:28] closer today Father God we know this
[1:35:32] today it was a special day for us to
[1:35:35] hear this message May that's message
[1:35:38] Heavenly Father goes the right deep in
[1:35:42] our heart may we meditate about it
[1:35:45] because when the pastor was preaching we
[1:35:49] saw our position in congression
[1:35:53] for that Fountain of Life we see it
[1:35:56] coming down
[1:35:59] in the time of Abraham
[1:36:02] you met him Heavenly Father
[1:36:05] he knew who you are
[1:36:08] and our Lord Brother Branham said
[1:36:10] we are living in abrahamic age
[1:36:14] if that is the case Lord God we need to
[1:36:17] meet Melchizedek
[1:36:19] what Abraham
[1:36:22] experienced we shall experience today
[1:36:26] for there's nothing wrong heavenly
[1:36:28] father of what is happening
[1:36:31] you know better you know our heart that
[1:36:34] things should be in this way I pray for
[1:36:37] our pastor
[1:36:38] he was just relaxing you were just
[1:36:41] giving more strength we know Heavenly
[1:36:43] Father the poor people belong to him he
[1:36:47] will come back and stand behind this
[1:36:49] puppet and feed us with the manner from
[1:36:52] heaven
[1:36:55] may you visit his family
[1:36:58] may you visit the entire church the boat
