TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but now a woman the seventh seal of redemption that the Lord the lamb took within himself yeah it is cold but yeah the Lord the Bible says um I would put like this amen all right we are through here we're going to read that it says it brings Christ into you amen you know Jesus yes you can you know Jesus everybody could accept Jesus but not Christ even the Jews they were satisfied at the name Jesus being Jesus amen to they never persecuted anybody for calling Jesus Jesus for calling him are you aware of that amen today for calling him the seventh seal lead to another spring because he should let me do it like this here is the uh the the book of redemption that the lamp took within himself within himself didn't Jesus say the father is in me amen when asked show us your father he says the father is in me um amen now if their father is in him where is the throne amen all right amen maybe I've got the book for you here I can quickly refer to it ending that is if not we'll see it later he says the prophet of God amen amen because he was sent through him God revealed these things no problem I'll read it to you amen the prophet says you know some of them maybe have got the book since we started things the first Throne was in heaven it's second in Jesus okay now the first throne in heaven and then he condescended was aware the second throne in Jesus Jesus said the father is in me so the second Throne was in him so the book was on the one said on the throne the one that sat on the throne is this one in Jesus amen amen all right this is what this ministry has come to reveal so that's why it says the lamb took the book within himself amen amen and and today she speaks of foreign [Music] if he doesn't say anything from the throne don't accept it is not from his throne then he continues to say uh now with the lamp with the book in his hand then what is we are ready to ask his grace and mercy upon us to open foreign look let me repeat to you again John the Baptist foreign introduced him to the Jews then at the end time his brother is Elijah the seventh messenger um standing in the camp um he's still in the game between Time and Eternity all right amen now if you introduce eternity I want to introduce eternity to you what am I going to introduce our Scion all right amen now here it is let's look at it John introduced Jesus so yes Behold the Lamb of God the sin of the world now foreign [Applause] [Music] he is now here the lamp is here [Applause] because introduced the one who came into him [Applause] you see that is the difference and now that's why Elon if it is the one who is in him the only way for you to see him brother comes into you amen amen that's the only way to see it otherwise you will speak about the one who came to brother and you know nothing about it amen all right amen that's why at the end of it says the weight is now in the bride because as a messenger he has come to introduce the word now the bride must receive the word when the bride received then the messenger says now I must decrease and he must increase man because if the seed given to a woman now she will conceive and she will bring forth [Music] so the children of God like how Jesus was born Joseph had nothing to do with it angel that brought the seed yeah to marry women because the law of reproduction will never take place if there is no woman ourselves amen amen amen it will only will can only be implemented if there is a female that's why God said it is no good that men should be alone amen because he will just remain alone as long as there's no female amen so every seed must come through the field it must come through the field all right so now Adam alone would not bring forth the Lord Jesus alone could not bring forth he must have a bride of men was a go between why why not why negotiating times sent by God uh what kind of a woman it should be because the prophet says he looked for a character and this character should be the same as Christ I don't I don't see Christ woman tolerating a woman who is denying him he says I'm the seventh seal I'm the revelation of the seven series and the wife says no foreign [Music] we are ready to ask for mercy amen amen we are ready to ask for mercy upon us to open the seven seal book to us and let us pass this book when it is opened now you look up past the kitten of time [Applause] prophet [Music] that was beyond the human being amen amen and now the prophet when when this young man okay I saw the enemy coming he said we are in trouble here we are being surrounded who is with us [Applause] because we are more than them [Applause] so this man amen you couldn't understand because he is human Elijah nobody and the name was coming on horses and so forth but the prophet says they that be with us they that are with us amen Hallelujah because now with the prophet there was a beyond the kitten of time [Music] there was a congregation that was beyond the curtain of time and the young man could not see them and the prophet said open his eyes amen he never called for prayer line because they said pool don't need a prayer life it is something that God has promised is going to do he feels I don't attempt so we answer amen is something that God has promised he learned when he arrived at the house of Abraham he never said pray for a child he said I will return according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son he never said pray foreign amen look donga God promised the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost and we don't see Peter calling for a prayer line for the people to receive the Holy Ghost he said go to the upper room and wait amen amen it never said and pray and fast at the time if they do that it's no longer a promise if your father says I'm going to buy you a bicycle it's a promise amen and if you trust you you believe your father you start talking around telling friends my father my dad is gonna buy me amen it's a promise but if you see you we see you starting to pray oh Father you give me a bicycle it's no longer I promise all right [Music] I don't know if there's a farmer here I don't know if there is a family the law is that you bury the seed you will cover it would you leave it we see amen and there is the the law of reproduction the law of growth your work is just to put it down in the ground oh we I am and water it said that's all amen so we don't see a farmer every morning going their way he has put the seed praying oh Lord amen amen oh let it germinate oh my god oh Lord God let it bring forth amen no there is the law in that seed you know the law is in the seed not in the sower I've only no no no no no no no amen the law is in you the law of life in you and when light comes upon it the witch comes it germinates it Springs up to life because it has that law that when the seven seal shall be preached it picks up that seed the Lord that is in that scene and that law in that City comes forth it is revealed because it is the Lord that was put into it but if it is then you've got to preach day and night amen amen and it's if you say it is not revealed because it is not revealed amen foreign yeah I'm telling you the truth some people they believe they see the truth amen if you meet a person who has never seen God and he's been hearing from the people that there is a God now he cannot something that he has never seen who is God then somebody comes home to us to hold a Revival is to for to deny God to say the seven is not revealed you are denying God pick out and there he comes and see there is no God you'll hear somebody jumping say yes amen foreign I'm out the body of Elisha there was was tired but this young man was blessed because he was he saw the backside [Music] of the Prophet come Prophet amen amen amen he looked at the prophet every time he just look he was just looking at a man whom he believed to be God's prophets but that day he saw beyond the curtain of time when he's were opened not this one he saw the Angels around the prophet of God Amen amen amen what a privilege oh Elijah he walked with Elisha seeing Elisha sing in Elijah who had disciple that God is in Elijah amen amen now there were some others at Bethel uh -huh that's such a requirement a Jordan like that there were also some people there be living Elijah to be God's prophet buddy Elisha was this type of the bride of Christ the prophet um he desired and then when to have the same thing that was in that prophet because of God has sent that Prophet to inject in this man amen the real believer is the one who has received what was in Elijah that's not the real believer the real believer today is the one who has received what was in Brotherhood that's the real believer amen all right was not just as the brother puts it very well a follower of brother of brother Elijah amen amen you know if you follow you are just a follower sometimes he comes to something else that will put you back because you don't have the same thing Lord followed Abraham then they came to a certain place foreign now if you follow there are things we'll cope with but there's a time when you can no longer cope wasn't amen amen amen they follow Jesus until at a certain place he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man then they went back amen now the Bible didn't say they went away it says they went back 85 they went back means they went back way a denomination it's something that is stationary little every day I here a man saying today uh it is not revealed you come next year it is amen the lamination is made of a stationary Ministry [Music] amen I'm going in stages I'm no longer the same as I was yesterday the evening service has put me on a higher place I'm expecting tomorrow service to put me higher than higher and higher I go and Crossing on the upward way Hallelujah you call me today I preach to you something you call for another Revival I come with the same thing you call me again still the same thing you are going nowhere I'm only taking you in a merry-go-rounded if I can say to you testify you'll tell me what you have seen this morning and if tomorrow I say testify you tell me what you have received right now so that is a I'm pressing on the upwards [Applause] the Bible says let us run the race that is set before us running a race you run until you hit the finish line and you don't win how there is no winner all they are still fresh amen amen but as the track holds up now some starts to remain behind summer shooting ahead it is like that we'll see we will look at that amen amen if you go to the denomination they read it to you Jesus saves you come tomorrow oh yes it's again Jesus says you come again the next day what's up [Music] so you are getting nowhere so you are expecting now then I I continue Amanda all right amen myself if you have come to Jesus now you start working in the light blessing after blessing amen power after power now he's taking you now amen to through the stages [Music] amen not a stationary gospel I just run the race that is set before us amen amen amen and run for a price um there is a prize okay uh so this is the part that I wanted to put across this evening amen amen then we'll take it through the through the three stages but we thank God for this one because while I'm picking this size we are gonna continue with this one here where it says where is the book the book here Feast of the trumpets yes Feast of the trumpets here page 15. this is what we are we are trying to look at it says Abraham and and Sarah we're looking for a coming son but baby now this coming soon made by God and uh for 25 years they had to look for it song but they were at the end of the journey when you come to the end now of the journey go figure God had appeared in many forms through the church as he did through the church ages the lights and so forth he spoke to Abraham by Voices but just before the coming son all right and immedi he changed the body of Abraham and Sarah immediately after this so they could receive the son watching Thompson notice the last sign that they've got they've they that they got before the sun arrived was Jehovah walking to them in the form of a man um in the form of a man everything amen meaning that if we were to read I feel that I I should this is what we are going to continue with you listen to this working up in the form of amen that was the last time that was what that was all amen I I will put it this way we'll read them the rest the Lord willing there is let me read you this when God created things finally he came to the final stage of creation but but I read where brother Brennan says this is the uh what do you call this book masterpiece yeah yeah I know you've got to remind the people time and again finally when Jesus was working on a pattern finally they came up forth upon the earth a Perfection and that was a man amen amen I promise you I'm closing listen yeah when he was working working on a pattern creation finally everybody finally there was they came forth upon the Earth perfection and that was a man then he could see Robin in that man that it looked like him I'm not yeah yeah you see amen now finally catch that for tomorrow if God gives us tomorrow finally God could see in that man his only resemblance um so God sort of became men became the mirror of God amen so when God wanted to see himself then he could look at the man listen listen finally here the church Iman is now supposed to be taking the place of Christ amen amen God dwells in the nature in the stature of a man reflecting himself into that that's perfect worship perfect worship you see perfect worship amen that is perfect Perfection comes when men is he God is in um I can't read more than this listen how Perfection comes here let me read something the the last thing let me say the last thing amen amen amen [Music] where's that picture of mine now right listen soul is in prison that is your own quotation amen the servant still brings him back to the Earth and come and took the book out of the right hand of him and sit down and claim what he owned I've been listening to the man of God saying Clinton redeemed and that's it and said down to claim what he owned what he had redeemed he's always been that said the pool it's always been that faithful don't listen you you claim I mean Elisha I like you claim Tata you claim what is today you claim what belongs to you amen I claim this house as an inheritance and generally okay amen now listen to it finally amen and this has been this is this has it's always has been that said pool oh Elisha who end the spirit uh because Elijah was sent to Elijah amen amen some are also they will follow us but the Elisha Elijah was specially sent to Elijah because if God sends Somebody To You that somebody he comes to drop what is from God in you amen amen so you see the difference now between just a follower um and the two and the one to whom this the message is sent um he will prepare the ground first so if God is gonna use you he will prepare you first because he's going to drop something into you amen amen listen here the ministry comes to its Perfection when it reproduced Christ [Music] amen amen amen it reproduce Christ again amen amen amen because Christ was in Jesus Christ now at the end of time this ministry must reproduce again in humans we look at it that when it was produced Christ cried out foreign now who is this milk because he came to Brenda and whoever came to brother Branham has to come to you amen the one who came to Elijah ended up in Elisha because brother Brennan says Elisha amen stand for the bride um and Elisha cried out where is the god of amen he was in need of not only the spoke not the spoken word to only but the god of Elijah [Music] that's why we want to understand the way he said he understood we want to see God the way Elijah saw him a man amen amen amen we are not second-handed classes I killed Allah and just let just dust off this before we go and but she is that's why we could see people can't come and sit here amen let's baposa something will try as you think that one I will call the men of God to come forth amen God has blessed you and he will keep on blessing you I'm a witness I've seen it no men can sit under this condition yeah unless there's something in him so we believe we are here this this is the the church the mamelodi church in this place [Applause] and what is this place called now when we are in mamelodi um it is aquatic Church in mamelodi [Applause] because we are the same We Are One amen we believe the same thing and I've seen it myself now for coming here with me is not a waste I don't need money to come here I need to face because the pool here is that the
