[1:18:37] Christ,
[1:18:40] uh we are together again.
[1:18:43] We want to thank God for everything.
[1:18:47] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; I'm bringing the greetings from Zambia.
[1:18:54] I just I was telling the elders that
[1:18:58] I I don't want to when I get there
[1:19:02] I don't just want to say we have a live
[1:19:04] streaming and streaming
[1:19:09] I will fish around
[1:19:13] to look for the children of God
[1:19:16] that we can fellowship with
[1:19:20] and I will give them live streaming
[1:19:22] material.
[1:19:25] and I did that. Amen.
[1:19:28] So I met the children of God in the area
[1:19:32] and the pastor there is pastor Tombo.
[1:19:36] I spoke to him yesterday
[1:19:39] saying I must greet the children of God.
[1:19:43] So we spent time together.
[1:19:48] uh how I met him.
[1:19:51] When I get there, I phonet
[1:19:56] him from Malawi.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; He gave me the number to the pastor of
[1:20:02] the area
[1:20:04] by the name of Kalaza Muanza.
[1:20:09] He's a friend to our elder masid.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; So they met in Tanzania.
[1:20:17] And then he said to me he will meet me
[1:20:21] but we haven't met as yet
[1:20:26] where I'm staying where he's staying
[1:20:29] with a gap of 200 kilometers.
[1:20:34] He said there's a pastor around there.
[1:20:40] You can meet him. He gave me the number
[1:20:44] and then I met him. We fellowship
[1:20:46] together say about the word of God had a
[1:20:50] good time even when I come. I said I'm
[1:20:54] going back home.
[1:20:56] He said may God richly bless you as my
[1:20:59] regards to the church. We will meet
[1:21:02] again. We had a good time. Amen. So when
[1:21:05] we were sharing knowing that I come from
[1:21:09] here in South Africa
[1:21:11] then when we buried the pastor
[1:21:14] he said go well and we will talk when
[1:21:16] you come here.
[1:21:18] He said to me, "I don't know pastor.
[1:21:22] I never met him. But I want to tell you
[1:21:25] one thing
[1:21:27] here in Africa can be Congo, Malawi,
[1:21:32] Zambia, Zimbabwe, anywhere. When message
[1:21:35] believer come from South Africa,
[1:21:39] we listen to them because that's where
[1:21:42] the prophet was.
[1:21:45] You start to tell me that your pastor
[1:21:49] departed at the age of 81.
[1:21:54] Tells me of something.
[1:21:57] Then I listened to him. He said the
[1:21:59] prophet
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; must have given him the bait.
[1:22:06] Amen. If brother
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; departed at the age of 55 or 56
[1:22:15] and he preached more than 50 years.
[1:22:20] I never met that old man
[1:22:23] but I believe that
[1:22:25] then I said hey if you say that
[1:22:30] I will take as it is
[1:22:33] amen so I'm trying to tell you that
[1:22:37] we are enjoying up there
[1:22:40] children of God are children of God the
[1:22:44] spirit is so nice
[1:22:46] there's nothing you can blame
[1:22:50] things are just going smooth.
[1:22:52] So by so saying I'm saying shalom shalom
[1:22:56] and may God richly bless you as we are
[1:22:59] going to continue this morning
[1:23:02] with the word of God. Amen.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; So this morning we will read from the
[1:23:10] Bible.
[1:23:12] Let's start with Genesis chapter 37.
[1:23:22] We will read verse 1 to5.
[1:23:32] Genesis 37 1-5.
[1:23:36] And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his
[1:23:39] father was a stranger, in the land of
[1:23:42] Canaan. These are the generations of
[1:23:45] Jacob. Joseph being 17 years old was
[1:23:49] feeding the flock with his brethren. And
[1:23:52] the late was with the son of Ba and with
[1:23:56] the sons of Zera, his father's wives.
[1:24:00] And Joseph brought unto his father their
[1:24:03] evil report. Now Israel loved Joseph
[1:24:07] more than all his children because he
[1:24:10] was the son of his old age. And he made
[1:24:13] him a coat of many colors. And when his
[1:24:17] brethren saw that their father loved him
[1:24:19] more than all his brethren, they hated
[1:24:22] him and could not speak peaceibly unto
[1:24:26] him.
[1:24:27] And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told
[1:24:30] it his brethren and they hated him yet
[1:24:33] the more
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; as we bow it
[1:24:38] harvest you can lead us in prayer.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Our gracious heavenly
[1:24:43] father Lord God Almighty here we are
[1:24:47] this morning we approach your throne of
[1:24:49] mercy with thanksgiving in our hearts.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; We came Lord Almighty this morning
[1:24:54] having an expectation. Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; To come and hear from you,
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Lord Almighty, what we know and what we
[1:25:02] have seen throughout ages is that Lord
[1:25:04] Almighty,
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; you always come and speak to us behind
[1:25:07] the vessel.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; And Father, this morning we pray for our
[1:25:10] elder Maria standing here behind this
[1:25:14] blessed pullpit. And father we pray the
[1:25:17] same anointing that always descend

[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; to fill him for him Lord almighty to
[1:25:26] come and deliver your word which will
[1:25:29] bless your children and which will take
[1:25:31] us from one step to another
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; which will take us from glory to glory.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Lord Almighty we came Lord Almighty with
[1:25:38] the same anointing. We say Lord
[1:25:40] Almighty, let it be the divine and
[1:25:43] supernatural anointings blending
[1:25:45] together this morning. Let it be an
[1:25:47] address from your throne to our thrones.
[1:25:49] Oh God, we pray, Father, committing the
[1:25:52] church into your hands, committing the
[1:25:54] preacher into your hands in the mighty
[1:25:56] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:25:57] Christ. Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:26:06] I don't know if uh
[1:26:09] Brahms from Gani has arrived but he was
[1:26:12] calling me that is on the way.
[1:26:24] But I believe Oh, God bless you.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; He's with Elder from
[1:26:33] uh if he's around, he can raise up his
[1:26:36] hand.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:26:47] thank God for everything.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Our elder there He's
[1:26:54] the one that groomed us.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; When I say us,
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; those that
[1:27:02] were in SJ,
[1:27:07] we they if they are there, they know
[1:27:10] what I'm talking about.
[1:27:12] It's a boarding school boarding school
[1:27:14] where we got the message.
[1:27:17] He stayed there
[1:27:20] with his family.
[1:27:22] on on weekends
[1:27:25] we will get up together about 20
[1:27:26] brothers
[1:27:30] and then go to his house. He will share
[1:27:33] the word of God with us.
[1:27:36] We will do his garden
[1:27:42] and you know he will cook for the sister
[1:27:44] will cook cook for us.
[1:27:48] Mama be he's late now.
[1:27:51] We we had a good time.
[1:27:53] I'm just honoring him this morning.
[1:27:57] Yes. That's we are here. We are because
[1:28:00] of his teaching.
[1:28:02] We thank God for everything. May God
[1:28:05] richly bless you.
[1:28:09] Amen.
[1:28:12] And amen. Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Everyone of you this morning.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; So this morning I want to share with you
[1:28:19] about this title.
[1:28:22] The plan of God
[1:28:26] is beyond the plan of a man.
[1:28:30] You know this morning,
[1:28:32] everyone of us has plans
[1:28:37] and even about tomorrow.
[1:28:39] You have a plan
[1:28:42] wish to do
[1:28:45] in life. You have wishes,
[1:28:49] but that's your plan.
[1:28:52] And then there's a plan of God
[1:28:55] that will go beyond your plan.
[1:28:59] But your plan
[1:29:02] aligned
[1:29:04] with the plan of God. You are more than
[1:29:07] a conqueror.
[1:29:10] But if your plan
[1:29:12] is against the plan of God,
[1:29:15] you'll have a problem in life.
[1:29:18] So our plan should align
[1:29:23] plan of God. If it can be like that, you
[1:29:27] won't have a problem
[1:29:31] because someone was saying,
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; you see the peak,
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; it will just get fat. Even if they hate
[1:29:41] it,
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; it doesn't care.
[1:29:48] When they say those in Maria hate it,
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; you will just find it working as f as it
[1:29:55] can be. It's its nature.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; But the children of God,
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; you hate them.
[1:30:04] God, here we just read.
[1:30:07] Joseph was hated
[1:30:10] by his own brother.
[1:30:14] But at the end, God has made him
[1:30:17] something.
[1:30:22] Well, where I want to start to start
[1:30:25] is from the book of Genesis
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; where brother Brennham says in this
[1:30:32] message
[1:30:34] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:30:36] saints.
[1:30:39] Brother Brennham says Cain
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; show he was religious
[1:30:47] just as religious as the other ones was
[1:30:54] and religious is a covering
[1:31:00] Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden
[1:31:04] when they found out they were naked
[1:31:07] they made themselves a religion
[1:31:11] find out
[1:31:13] just as soon as Adam found out he was
[1:31:15] separated from God
[1:31:20] in the state of trying to find God.
[1:31:24] He tried to hide from God.
[1:31:28] That's the nature of a man today.
[1:31:32] It's still his nature
[1:31:35] instead of coming down confessing saying
[1:31:40] I've been a church member for 10 years.
[1:31:46] I know nothing about God
[1:31:49] and try to hide behind the name of a
[1:31:52] church.
[1:31:55] Now, I want you to notice
[1:31:58] instead of coming out
[1:32:01] and it ought to have been Adam running
[1:32:04] through the garden,
[1:32:08] hollering. Father, father, where are
[1:32:10] you?
[1:32:13] Father, father.
[1:32:15] But it was the father
[1:32:18] running through the gardening
[1:32:22] Adam
[1:32:24] where
[1:32:28] can you see that? But I want to tell you
[1:32:31] this morning that was the plan of God.
[1:32:37] Adam
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; never intended
[1:32:41] to do what he did.
[1:32:44] Eve never intended
[1:32:48] to do what she did, but the plan of God
[1:32:53] allowed them for a reason.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. They just became the keys of life,
[1:33:04] the keys of the plan of God.
[1:33:09] that should start with them
[1:33:13] because God in his plan
[1:33:17] wanted to be a savior
[1:33:20] to be a redeemer
[1:33:22] to be a comfort
[1:33:24] to be our father and to be the
[1:33:28] bridegroom.
[1:33:30] That was the plan of God. And for the
[1:33:33] plan of God to be achieved,
[1:33:38] if must fall
[1:33:42] because God planned this thing before
[1:33:47] the foundation of the world.
[1:33:50] When this happened, it was the
[1:33:52] manifestation
[1:33:55] of what God has planned. I'm saying this
[1:33:58] because
[1:34:00] many people that cannot clearly see
[1:34:04] they say if if never did this, if Adam
[1:34:10] never did this, we could have been saved
[1:34:12] with God.
[1:34:14] Brothers and sisters, it's not like
[1:34:17] that. The plan of God was them
[1:34:22] be in that situation
[1:34:24] for God to be the savior.
[1:34:28] to be the redeemer
[1:34:30] so that we can be the bride of the Lord.
[1:34:34] If this has never happened,
[1:34:37] we wouldn't have been here this morning.
[1:34:40] We wouldn't have been the bride of the
[1:34:42] Lord Jesus Christ. But for the bride of
[1:34:44] Jesus Christ,
[1:34:47] Eve and Adam must be in that situation.
[1:34:53] And from that time, a man was running
[1:34:58] from the presence of God. And from that
[1:35:01] time,
[1:35:03] God was calling upon the man.
[1:35:07] God himself would take them out of the
[1:35:10] garden of Eden
[1:35:12] with the flaming sword on the edge of
[1:35:15] the gate
[1:35:18] bringing them back and the salt is the
[1:35:22] word of God.
[1:35:25] Amen. So it happens like that.
[1:35:29] Now let's continue
[1:35:31] to our scripture and the quote that I'm
[1:35:34] going to read. Israel and the church.
[1:35:38] Now watch. Now watch. When everything
[1:35:43] heaped up in Joseph,
[1:35:48] what
[1:35:50] a perfect man.
[1:35:53] The the one who was born of his father,
[1:35:58] loved of his father,
[1:36:01] hated of his brother.
[1:36:04] Loved of his father.
[1:36:06] hated of his brothers. The Lord Jesus
[1:36:10] watch acting out every character in
[1:36:12] there.
[1:36:16] Look at Joseph the perfect one.
[1:36:21] This is natural as well. You see, if a
[1:36:24] man can have many kids,
[1:36:28] one or two he will love more than the
[1:36:32] others. And if the others realize that
[1:36:36] they will hate him,
[1:36:40] there was never even a man
[1:36:43] who say I love my kids the same. Never.
[1:36:50] But you will say, "I love my kids." And
[1:36:54] tell the people that I love my kids. But
[1:36:57] in your heart, you say, "I will love
[1:36:59] this one the most." And this other one
[1:37:04] must not know and other people must not
[1:37:07] know. But there are certain things you
[1:37:09] cannot hide because Jacob being Israel,
[1:37:14] he did everything for them. But with
[1:37:17] Joseph, he did what is in his heart. And
[1:37:21] they have realized that this is loved by
[1:37:25] the father. They hated him. Why they
[1:37:29] hate him?
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says, for no reason.
[1:37:35] As I read,
[1:37:37] watch how it was portrayed
[1:37:41] in Jesus.
[1:37:43] His father loved him. His brothers,
[1:37:48] hated him without a cross.
[1:37:52] He was spiritual,
[1:37:55] could foretell things,
[1:37:58] could interpret dreams.
[1:38:00] He couldn't help being that.
[1:38:06] You know, brothers and sisters, who we
[1:38:08] are,
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; it's not what we choose,
[1:38:13] it's what God has given us, but others
[1:38:17] will hate you for what God has gave you.
[1:38:20] And at the end as an individual you you
[1:38:23] don't know what to do because maybe
[1:38:26] Joseph was praying because he was
[1:38:28] spiritual
[1:38:30] and saying God Lord God I pray that you
[1:38:34] help me for my brothers not to hate me.
[1:38:39] This thing that makes me hated by them.
[1:38:43] let them go away because I want my
[1:38:46] brothers and myself to embrace one
[1:38:49] another. And God was listening to his
[1:38:53] but after that he gave him a dream.
[1:38:59] When he give him a dream, the dream was
[1:39:02] we were in the field
[1:39:04] and we have sheep
[1:39:08] and yours, your sheep
[1:39:11] fell before mine.
[1:39:22] And a dream is something you cannot
[1:39:24] control.
[1:39:26] A vision is something that you cannot
[1:39:29] convey. If God shows vu visions,
[1:39:34] it will come like that. If God shows you
[1:39:37] a dream, you are unconscious
[1:39:40] but it happen in your subconscious.
[1:39:44] It just come you never ask there amongst
[1:39:48] you who can tell you that what you're
[1:39:51] going to dream tonight when you are
[1:39:52] sleeping.
[1:39:55] Is there anyone who can tell me that?
[1:39:57] No, you don't know. But at night, you
[1:40:01] will have a dream and you do not have a
[1:40:03] control over that dream. Joseph was like
[1:40:08] that. He never had a control over his
[1:40:11] dream. But he shared a dream to his
[1:40:15] brothers and they hated him.
[1:40:21] Agreed. They started counting.
[1:40:24] 11 sheep
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; fell before one.
[1:40:31] This one is him.
[1:40:33] 11 is others.
[1:40:38] This man is undermining us. I will show
[1:40:41] him. Then they go and plan.
[1:40:45] Hey. The people plan
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; and they will plan about you.
[1:40:50] But the plan of man cannot outshine
[1:40:54] the plan of God.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; They go to the field and look after the
[1:41:04] sheep and the cow everything. When they
[1:41:08] were there, he heard them speaking bad
[1:41:11] things
[1:41:13] about their father,
[1:41:17] the one who brought them on earth.
[1:41:20] Then Joseph, because he was young,
[1:41:23] they were elders.
[1:41:25] He said, "I don't know what to do.
[1:41:28] I must just tell my dad." Then he will
[1:41:31] get home and say, "Daddy, I was with my
[1:41:34] brothers. They were talking about you
[1:41:37] and nothing good about you. They were
[1:41:39] just talking bad things about you.
[1:41:42] Do you understand? And Joseph said, "I
[1:41:46] can't take it. I don't know what to do."
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; But that's what God has given him.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; One of the days he dreamed again he
[1:41:58] said, "No, this one I will never tell
[1:42:01] them because when I tell them is the
[1:42:04] more they hate me. And they don't know
[1:42:07] my brothers. They don't know. I love
[1:42:10] them so much,
[1:42:12] but they hate me. And I don't know what
[1:42:14] to do because what I have is a God-given
[1:42:18] gift.
[1:42:25] He said, "Daddy,
[1:42:27] I had a dream.
[1:42:29] I saw the sun and the moon and the 11
[1:42:34] stars. Then they say stop there.
[1:42:38] I can see where you are going.
[1:42:41] Stop there. When the brothers hear that
[1:42:44] the Bible says they hated him yet the
[1:42:50] more
[1:42:52] if the hatred
[1:42:54] was 60%.
[1:42:57] It went to 100%.
[1:43:00] The only thing that they can do is to
[1:43:04] eliminate him
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; so that there will be no dreams.
[1:43:15] They went and plan that is why if you go
[1:43:19] to the taxi industry
[1:43:23] you will not survive. Hey, there's
[1:43:25] people they blend.
[1:43:27] They check your movement.
[1:43:30] If they want to eliminate you, what time
[1:43:32] you wake up, what time you go to sleep,
[1:43:35] what time you go to work, what time you
[1:43:37] go to shopping, how many people you,
[1:43:40] they will trace you, the day they hit
[1:43:43] you, it's just once.
[1:43:46] Now, Joseph's brothers, I had a meeting
[1:43:50] and plan about Joseph that this man want
[1:43:53] to kill him.
[1:43:55] One of the days they saw him coming.
[1:43:58] They say
[1:44:01] they also thank the Lord.
[1:44:03] Lord,
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; you brought him right.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; There he come.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; This must be the will of God. We are
[1:44:13] going to kill him today. That that is
[1:44:15] the plan of man. But we'll never
[1:44:18] outshine the plan of God.
[1:44:22] He was happy having food for them,
[1:44:26] having greetings from the parents from
[1:44:29] embracing them. Amen.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; You know, greeting them with the holy
[1:44:34] kiss. They were cleing their teeth that
[1:44:37] today
[1:44:48] repeat itself. challenge.
[1:44:54] Joseph comes
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; they take the food they don't deny the
[1:44:58] food they take them and they eat
[1:45:02] thinking of how do we approach
[1:45:06] to murder him I don't know maybe they
[1:45:09] had drivers
[1:45:12] graves
[1:45:13] enjoying
[1:45:18] but when the time arrives
[1:45:20] we execute
[1:45:23] you know the blood of men cannot
[1:45:26] outshine the plan of God. Go and plan
[1:45:30] and your plan must align with the plan
[1:45:34] of God. If not the plan of God, brothers
[1:45:37] and sisters, we better stop.
[1:45:47] Then he come
[1:45:49] they us
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; they even plan lies
[1:45:55] we're going to kill him and tell they at
[1:45:59] home that the animals
[1:46:03] or everything hey people can plant
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; they even planted by
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; but there was an elder amongst
[1:46:14] He said to them, "Brothers, the person
[1:46:17] you are talking about is one of our
[1:46:20] people is our father's son. How can we
[1:46:25] do s
[1:46:29] you understand? Then they started to
[1:46:31] hear this one is working against us."
[1:46:37] They went,
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; you understand? and to try to kill him.
[1:46:42] But once safe, we'd rather kill an
[1:46:45] animal,
[1:46:46] put the blood in his clothes,
[1:46:50] go home so that we can
[1:46:54] so we can find money, we're going to
[1:46:56] sell him.
[1:47:00] So at least the plan of selling him
[1:47:05] worked very well and they sold him to
[1:47:09] the Ishmalites.
[1:47:11] But they don't know that is the plan of
[1:47:14] God.
[1:47:17] You know when Joseph was born,
[1:47:20] God saw him as the prime minister
[1:47:26] in Egypt. But when you saw him, you saw
[1:47:30] him as somebody who is dead.
[1:47:34] You say he's dead. God is the prime
[1:47:37] minister. Which one is going to pass?
[1:47:40] Here is the plan of God. Here is the
[1:47:43] plan of God.
[1:47:47] Children of God, walk upon the will
[1:47:53] and the plan of God.
[1:47:58] wrong.
[1:47:59] They sold him. They were happy.
[1:48:03] No more dreams.
[1:48:06] No more spiritualists.
[1:48:09] No more person that is reporting us to
[1:48:11] the father.
[1:48:14] No more this.
[1:48:16] But the only one that remain
[1:48:19] is Benjamin.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; A little brother of Joseph.
[1:48:23] Ah, but this one is a toothless lion.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; A shy boy. He doesn't dream. He doesn't
[1:48:31] say anything. We don't have a problem.
[1:48:34] But that one we sold to him.
[1:48:39] But the dream will stay. The vision will
[1:48:44] stay. You can try to cover it, try to
[1:48:50] kill it. It will stay.
[1:48:55] because that's the plan of God. They
[1:48:58] sold him and when they get to Egypt, he
[1:49:02] worked in Egypt as a slave. Then he
[1:49:05] dreamed in Egypt. The dreams in Egypt
[1:49:08] uplifted Egypt and the the king of Egypt
[1:49:13] said, "This young man, I need him."
[1:49:17] Remember
[1:49:19] his own brothers don't need him but
[1:49:23] Egypt needed him.
[1:49:28] He stayed there. He grew up there and
[1:49:32] one of the days he was uplifted
[1:49:36] to be the prime minister
[1:49:39] in Egypt.
[1:49:41] You know the plan of God. So those that
[1:49:44] were enjoying grapes and beldons there,
[1:49:49] having those meetings there.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; You know the plan of God will put you in
[1:49:58] a squeeze
[1:49:59] until the person you hate,
[1:50:02] you will go and bo.
[1:50:08] That is the plan of God. And their
[1:50:10] father said, "Come here. You can see we
[1:50:15] no longer have food here. Go and hunt
[1:50:18] around."
[1:50:19] The only place that they knew had food
[1:50:24] was Egypt
[1:50:27] they were going 10 of them.
[1:50:30] 10 of them because Benjamin was still
[1:50:33] young.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; They went there. When they get there,
[1:50:37] they asked for food.
[1:50:39] They were given go back home. But Joseph
[1:50:43] said to them, "You are not all
[1:50:46] the one that is remaining at home. Bring
[1:50:50] him." They went back home, "But no, no,
[1:50:53] we won't go back there. That man is not
[1:50:56] good. We will not bring this one." But
[1:51:00] go back there. Send them back again.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; They had to bring Benjamin.
[1:51:05] When they get there, you know the story.
[1:51:08] Joseph, you know, revealed himself.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am Joseph,
[1:51:14] your brother."
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Now, the sun
[1:51:19] and the moon
[1:51:22] and the stars bow before him and they
[1:51:26] started to realize that the 11 sheep
[1:51:31] was them.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Joseph still standing.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; They bow before him.
[1:51:40] Why it was the plan of God?
[1:51:44] I'm always saying one brother called me
[1:51:48] and say brother relaxation
[1:51:52] because I say relax in the word of God.
[1:51:56] Let God do the work. Don't sweat
[1:52:01] like this and death. You will fail and
[1:52:06] die of heart attack.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; But if you can be like Joseph
[1:52:15] when they sell him, you say, "Lord God,
[1:52:18] you know better." If they accuse him,
[1:52:22] you say, "Lord God, you know better." If
[1:52:25] he's in the jail in Egypt, he said,
[1:52:27] "Lord God, you know better." Until God
[1:52:31] himself
[1:52:32] sended him.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together this morning?
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; A child of God is someone who does
[1:52:45] things soberly.
[1:52:49] But I want to tell you when you see the
[1:52:51] people are in group they are dangerous
[1:52:58] you know what they doing
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; they are lying one to another
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; we'll tell him
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; there's nothing like that let me advise
[1:53:11] you
[1:53:12] listen to your conscience
[1:53:16] that's where God stay and God will give
[1:53:19] you the guidance.
[1:53:21] You know, God will never leave us
[1:53:24] astray.
[1:53:27] Then the brothers of Joseph started to
[1:53:30] realize
[1:53:35] this man has defeated us.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We we thought we can kill him. We
[1:53:41] failed. We thought we can sell him. We
[1:53:44] failed. Today we bow before him. This is
[1:53:48] the work of God.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm wondering when I was
[1:53:56] preparing this message,
[1:54:00] it's always
[1:54:02] 10
[1:54:04] against two.
[1:54:06] Always.
[1:54:11] It was brothers of Joseph
[1:54:13] against him and Benjamin
[1:54:16] because Jacob being Israel loved
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Joseph
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; and Benjamin
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says he got them at
[1:54:28] his old age
[1:54:32] and he loved them. But the 10
[1:54:37] there were problem.
[1:54:40] Do you know that?
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; How many spies did Moses send?
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; How many?
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; 12. How many came with a good report?
[1:54:54] How many came with a bad report?
[1:54:58] There's a problem with 10.
[1:55:04] He sent 12
[1:55:07] 10k.
[1:55:09] Then they said to Moses, "But we are in
[1:55:12] the church
[1:55:14] in the service."
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Let's read that scripture
[1:55:22] again.
[1:55:24] Numbers chapter 13.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; You You will read from verse one.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Numbers chapter 13
[1:55:34] from verse one.
[1:55:37] And the Lord spoke spake unto Moses,
[1:55:39] saying, Send thou men that they may
[1:55:42] search the land of Canaan, which I give
[1:55:46] unto the children of Israel. Of every
[1:55:48] tribe of their fathers shall he send a
[1:55:51] man, everyone a ruler among them. And
[1:55:54] Moses by the commandment of the Lord
[1:55:57] sent them from the wilderness of Pon.
[1:56:00] All those men were heads of the children
[1:56:03] of Israel.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; They were heads.
[1:56:07] in the
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. You see? Amen.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; He choose the head and he say you go if
[1:56:15] you read verse four going down those are
[1:56:18] the names.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Now they went there and they must give
[1:56:24] the report. Can we read the report?
[1:56:27] Verse 26.
[1:56:29] 26
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; going to 28.
[1:56:32] And they went and came to Moses and to
[1:56:34] Aaron, and to all the congregation of
[1:56:37] the children of Israel, unto the
[1:56:39] wilderness of Pon to Kadesh, and brought
[1:56:44] back word unto them, and unto the unto
[1:56:47] all the congregation, and showed them
[1:56:49] the fruit of the land. And they told him
[1:56:52] and said, We came unto the land whether
[1:56:55] thou sendest us, and surely it floweth
[1:56:58] with milk and honey, and this is the
[1:57:01] fruit of it. Nevertheless, the people be
[1:57:04] strong that dwell in the land, and the
[1:57:07] cities are world, and every great, and
[1:57:10] moreover, we saw the children of Anak
[1:57:13] there.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:16] When they went there,
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; they were singing a song saying in the
[1:57:24] what are we going to sing in
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; 12 of them
[1:57:28] understand
[1:57:30] saying Lord
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; it's you leading us
[1:57:34] Lord it's you leading us
[1:57:38] and the Lord when they get there the
[1:57:41] status change
[1:57:45] maybe They were walking spying the land.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Joshua was with Caleb.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; This one was this one. With this one,
[1:57:53] maybe he was taking a corner or maybe
[1:57:58] behind a tree somewhere.
[1:58:00] Then he saw a man
[1:58:04] with six fingers.
[1:58:06] This is
[1:58:09] a man with six fingers. When he look at
[1:58:11] himself, that man was double his size.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Then he took notes.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Agree. They must give the report.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; They must give a report.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; They took notes.
[1:58:27] Then when they get there to Moses and
[1:58:31] Aaron,
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; they give the report.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Grapes.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; They came with the grapes.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Milk and honey.
[1:58:41] the fruits, the fruit of the land and
[1:58:44] everything.
[1:58:45] They said that land is very much good,
[1:58:49] is very much rich.
[1:58:51] Nevertheless,
[1:58:53] those people are strong. Stronger than
[1:58:57] who?
[1:58:58] Stronger than the Lord?
[1:59:01] No, they cannot be stronger than now.
[1:59:04] They come with evil report
[1:59:09] to the ch. They said to the children of
[1:59:12] Israel
[1:59:14] to the can we read it,
[1:59:18] you know, um just like
[1:59:25] they could say 26. So let's read verse
[1:59:27] 26.
[1:59:31] And they went and came to Moses and to
[1:59:34] Aaron and to all the congregation of the
[1:59:37] children of Israel.
[1:59:40] Moses and all the congregation.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; So they give the congregation and Moses
[1:59:48] and Aaron the report.
[1:59:51] They say we won't make it. Those people
[1:59:56] are more powerful than us. And that is
[2:00:00] true. They were more powerful than them,
[2:00:04] but they are not powerful
[2:00:07] to God.
[2:00:10] Golad was more powerful than David, but
[2:00:15] he was not powerful than God. Should we
[2:00:19] rely on ourselves, on our effort in the
[2:00:24] plan of God?
[2:00:28] Amen.
[2:00:29] If you read verse one, it says, "And the
[2:00:32] Lord spake unto Moses."
[2:00:36] So God had a plan. Had a saying that he
[2:00:41] give to Moses. He give to Moses and
[2:00:45] Moses to the 12 spies. And the 12 spies
[2:00:50] to the congregation.
[2:00:52] And the congregation must accept the
[2:00:56] report because those people were not
[2:00:59] ordinary
[2:01:01] where they hat
[2:01:04] amongst their tribe
[2:01:08] but they came
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; with the wrong report.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like verse 30.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Read it for us. And Caleb still the
[2:01:19] steilled the people before Moses and
[2:01:22] said, "Let us go up at once and possess
[2:01:26] it, for we are well able to overcome
[2:01:29] it."
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; That's Caleb.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Caleb said right there in the
[2:01:35] congregation,
[2:01:37] let us go up. He killed the people. He
[2:01:41] comfored them. He told them that in
[2:01:45] Israel there is God
[2:01:53] because the report came
[2:01:55] saying we are crers before that.
[2:02:00] But Caleb says we will eat them last
[2:02:07] contrary to the report of 10 men.
[2:02:17] Brothers and sisters,
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; listen to your conscience.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Read verse 32 for us.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Verse 32.
[2:02:31] But as for you, your carcasses, they
[2:02:34] shall fall in this wilderness.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Uh 32. Is it true?
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry.
[2:02:40] And they brought up an evil report of
[2:02:42] the land which they had searched unto
[2:02:45] the children of Israel, saying, The land
[2:02:48] through which we have gone to search it
[2:02:50] is a land that eatth up the inhabitants
[2:02:53] thereof, and all the people that we saw
[2:02:56] in it are men of great stature.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; 33
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; And there we saw the giants, the sons of
[2:03:05] Anch, which come
[2:03:09] which come of the giants and we were in
[2:03:12] our own sight as grasshoppers and so we
[2:03:16] were in their sight.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; When he he he he become
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; the 10 spies
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; became the spokesperson
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; of the devil.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; The spokesperson
[2:03:32] of those people.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; They are going to eat us. We are like
[2:03:37] grasshoppers today.
[2:03:40] So he speak for them, but they never
[2:03:42] said so.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; But wait until chapter 14 of the same uh
[2:03:50] uh Bible
[2:03:54] verse 24.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Verse 24.
[2:04:00] But my servant Caleb, because he had
[2:04:03] another spirit with him, and hath
[2:04:06] followed me fully, him will I bring into
[2:04:09] the land where into we went, and his
[2:04:12] seed shall possess it.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; This is what we need.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; We need people like Caleb.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; We need people like Joshua who had
[2:04:26] another spirit.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; We can have the spirit of God. We can
[2:04:33] all believe in God. But we need someone
[2:04:37] who had another spirit to see that.
[2:04:41] Those are the ones that we need.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; It's not enough to be in the message.
[2:04:53] It's not enough to worship in Mommy
[2:04:56] Lord. It's enough to have another
[2:05:00] spirit.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; A pastor, our pastor has told me a lot
[2:05:08] of things. But one of the thing he told
[2:05:10] me is a brother right there in our
[2:05:14] church in Modi. Few will be raptured.
[2:05:26] I
[2:05:28] like pastor what are you saying?
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; He said because God has made me to start
[2:05:38] that church
[2:05:40] and I know how it ends.
[2:05:48] He started to tell me in the early '7s
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; when he received the spoken word and he
[2:05:55] tells me I will go to an end. He said
[2:06:01] will be in the rapture.
[2:06:03] I'm sorry about that.
[2:06:06] Others will not like it but I have to
[2:06:09] say it. I'm sorry about that.
[2:06:15] 10 against two
[2:06:19] 10 brothers of Joseph
[2:06:22] against him and Benjamin
[2:06:24] this 10 against Joshua and Caleb
[2:06:29] it's not about the number it's about
[2:06:32] what you have if you have another spirit
[2:06:36] that's what God wants
[2:06:44] Jesus
[2:06:45] How many disciples?
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; 12.
[2:06:53] So it's 12. Get 12.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; 12.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; 12.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; 12.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; How many stood by the side of Jesus?
[2:07:03] You are quiet because you don't know. I
[2:07:06] will give you an answer.
[2:07:09] too.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; And then we read a scripture.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. because
[2:07:28] in the Bible,
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; how many disciples
[2:07:34] who said to
[2:07:38] who said that who said Jesus loved them
[2:07:40] the most over the others?
[2:07:54] Let me help you
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; with the scripture.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um Mark chapter 10
[2:08:05] 35.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 10:35.
[2:08:13] And James and John the son of Zebedee
[2:08:17] come unto him, saying, Master, we would
[2:08:20] that thou should us do for us whatsoever
[2:08:24] we shall desire.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Go further until 38.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, what would ye
[2:08:37] that I shall do for you?
[2:08:40] They said unto him, Grant unto us that
[2:08:42] we may sit one on thy right hand and the
[2:08:45] other on thy left in thy glory. But
[2:08:49] Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what
[2:08:52] he ask. Can ye drink of the cup that I
[2:08:55] drink of and be baptized with the
[2:08:58] baptism that I'm baptized with?
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Let me read what brother says.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; You know, one time
[2:09:10] The mother
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; of James and John,
[2:09:16] we won't have time to read it, but the
[2:09:19] mother of James and John
[2:09:22] came and asked for a place.
[2:09:25] You know that remember that the L Lord
[2:09:30] let my sons
[2:09:33] said on one side
[2:09:38] on the other side there's a mother
[2:09:41] desire
[2:09:44] for her son.
[2:09:47] Now the Bible says
[2:09:50] Jesus had
[2:09:52] 12 disciples.
[2:09:54] Having 12 disciples,
[2:09:57] there were two
[2:09:59] that he loved
[2:10:01] the most is John and James.
[2:10:05] He loved John so much until he led him
[2:10:11] in Patmos.
[2:10:15] The vision. Amen. Amen.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; John and James
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; against her.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; He was loved by Jesus.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Even the Bible says,
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; let's read it in Matthew chapter 10.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 10.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Read verse 1 then we'll read 5-9.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Matthews chapter 10 verse 1 then 5-9.
[2:10:46] And when he had called unto him his 12
[2:10:49] disciples, he gave them power against
[2:10:51] unclean spirits to cast them out and to
[2:10:55] heal all manner of sickness and all
[2:10:57] manner of disease. Verse five.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. To
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded
[2:11:04] them, saying, "Go not into the way of
[2:11:06] the Gentiles and into the city of the
[2:11:09] Samaritans. Enter ye not, but go rather
[2:11:13] to the lost sheep of the house of
[2:11:15] Israel. And as you go, preach, saying,
[2:11:19] The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal
[2:11:22] the sick, cleanse the lepers, rise the
[2:11:25] dead, cast out devils. Freely ye have
[2:11:28] received, freely give.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Provide neither gold nor silver nor
[2:11:33] brass in your pes.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; He called them
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; 12.
[2:11:40] That means his love
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; amongst them was not equal.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; He will say to Peter,
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; the day you transform, you the day you
[2:11:53] repent,
[2:11:54] the day you transform,
[2:11:57] strengthen your brothers.
[2:12:01] But he will say to Thomas because you do
[2:12:04] not believe come and check I was
[2:12:08] crucified. You know that time when he's
[2:12:11] talking there John the revelator he's
[2:12:15] sleeping at Jesus bos
[2:12:20] while he was sleeping there the others
[2:12:23] looking at him they started to hate him.
[2:12:31] Yeah, this man
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; loved us,
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; but he loved that one
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; the most.
[2:12:43] That's what the Bible says. That's what
[2:12:45] the brother says.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; It was always like that. Jesus knowing
[2:12:52] their heart, he continued saying, read
[2:12:56] verse 34.
[2:12:58] Verse
[2:12:59] 34.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Think not that I am come to send peace
[2:13:04] on earth. And
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; 35
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; I came not to send peace, but I but a
[2:13:09] sword. For I am come to set a man at
[2:13:13] variance against his father and the
[2:13:16] daughter against her mother and the
[2:13:18] daughter-in-law against her
[2:13:19] mother-in-law.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Is the same chapter
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; that I was reading. It was Jesus Christ
[2:13:28] addressing them.
[2:13:31] When you say peace,
[2:13:33] peace, peace, then destruction
[2:13:37] will come. He said, I bring the sword.
[2:13:42] What is the sword? The sword is the word
[2:13:45] of God. Brother Brenam received the
[2:13:48] sword and that sword tend to be the word
[2:13:53] of God. Hallelujah.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; It's not me, but the pastor in Zambia
[2:13:59] said to me, I believe that sword,
[2:14:03] brother
[2:14:04] fell in the hand of your pastor.
[2:14:11] He's listening. He's streaming.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; That is the plan of God.
[2:14:22] Can we outshine the plan of God? Can we?
[2:14:27] Who are we? We can't.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; The devil has failed.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; The the children of Israel
[2:14:36] failed.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; The spies
[2:14:39] failed. The disciples of Jesus Christ
[2:14:42] failed. Today, we will fail
[2:14:47] to be against the plan of God.
[2:14:51] You can. That is why here in the word of
[2:14:55] God. You just walk
[2:14:59] and walk one of the day it will be the
[2:15:02] last walk.
[2:15:07] And the Bible says Enoch walk and walk
[2:15:12] and walk. One day he was no more.
[2:15:18] I don't have a record
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; of Enoch having troubles
[2:15:24] doing a lot of things.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible just say he walked with God.
[2:15:30] Can you just walk with God and get into
[2:15:32] the
[2:15:41] people are busy
[2:15:44] left right center
[2:15:47] our sweat
[2:15:49] in the will of God at nothing doesn't
[2:15:53] adv
[2:15:58] us say something.
[2:16:03] Hey, the children of God are special
[2:16:06] people
[2:16:08] are special breed.
[2:16:10] The one that God has made
[2:16:15] the word of God.
[2:16:20] You don't have to worry, church.
[2:16:24] Things
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; are in control.
[2:16:28] God has never made a mistake.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; I repeat, God has never made a mistake.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; So when the disciples of Jesus Christ
[2:16:42] given power
[2:16:44] for healing, for casting out demons,
[2:16:49] it was not enough for them.
[2:16:52] They they wanted something again because
[2:16:56] if God gives this man this, that man,
[2:17:02] that one, then this one will love to be
[2:17:05] this one. This one will love to be that
[2:17:09] one, that one will want that one because
[2:17:12] a human being has never get satisfied.
[2:17:16] But in the word of God, we live to be
[2:17:19] satisfied
[2:17:20] of what God has given us.
[2:17:27] They hated John the Revelator for
[2:17:29] nothing.
[2:17:31] For nothing and what John had is what
[2:17:35] God has given him.
[2:17:37] If I hate you for what God has given
[2:17:40] you, you will be hurt
[2:17:44] myself because the plan of God cannot be
[2:17:47] outshined.
[2:17:49] Brothers and sisters, go home with that
[2:17:51] word. The word and the plan of God
[2:17:55] cannot be outshined by the plan of man.
[2:18:03] That is why I have told myself and you
[2:18:07] must tell yourself that I must just walk
[2:18:11] on the plan of God.
[2:18:13] I want to tell you this. God, do you
[2:18:17] still believe in God has prepared
[2:18:20] everything
[2:18:22] before the foundation?
[2:18:26] What is happening today is the
[2:18:28] manifestation
[2:18:30] of what God has planned.
[2:18:33] You cannot come here this morning and
[2:18:36] change what God did before the
[2:18:39] foundation of the world.
[2:18:41] Why? Are you worried?
[2:18:45] He has done it all.
[2:18:48] Those that are need healing, he has done
[2:18:51] it all. those that need job. He has done
[2:18:55] it all. Wait for the day of
[2:18:58] manifestation.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; If you don't find the time,
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; wait for the time.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; It's not that.
[2:19:10] Amen.
[2:19:15] Yeah,
[2:19:19] left, right, center, right?
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Looking for something that you cannot
[2:19:25] get,
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; but God has placed you somewhere.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:38] So I'm trying to tell the to tell the
[2:19:40] children of God
[2:19:42] again relaxing the word
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; he he has done it all.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; One young man was telling me
[2:19:57] the sisters are rejecting me. I have
[2:20:00] tried and tried.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; You know why? They were not yours. Yours
[2:20:06] is the one that you have today.
[2:20:09] God has never made a mistake.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you that.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Do not complain.
[2:20:22] Just say he has done it all.
[2:20:26] Amen.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus,
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; he's answering
[2:20:32] John and James.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "What do you need?"
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Let's read it in verse 36.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Verse 36.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. Mark Mark 10. Yeah. Mark 10.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Chapter 10:36.
[2:20:55] And he said unto them, "What would ye
[2:20:58] that I should do for you?"
[2:21:01] Then said unto him, "Grant unto us that
[2:21:04] we may sit one on thy right hand, and
[2:21:06] the other on the left hand in thy
[2:21:09] glory."
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, "Ye know not
[2:21:13] what you ask. Can ye drink of the cup
[2:21:16] that I drink of and be baptized with the
[2:21:19] baptism that I'm baptized with?"
[2:21:22] Now you read verse 40 and 41.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; But to sit on my right hand and on my
[2:21:30] left hand is not mine to give but it
[2:21:34] shall be given to them.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whom it is prepared.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; For whom it is prepared.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; For whom who it is.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Prepared. That means God has done the
[2:21:43] preparation.
[2:21:45] When he has prepared you and prepared
[2:21:48] for you, you will be given not your
[2:21:51] effort.
[2:21:53] Verse 41.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; And when the 10 heard it, they began to
[2:21:59] be much displeased
[2:22:01] with James and John.
[2:22:08] when
[2:22:10] said the Bible said the 10 of it were
[2:22:15] much displeased
[2:22:19] with John and James.
[2:22:21] I was surprised as well that when all
[2:22:24] these 12
[2:22:27] will be right 10 10
[2:22:31] 12 right 12 wrong here
[2:22:38] 10 wrong two right amongst those 10
[2:22:46] was
[2:22:51] had 12 disciples.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; The one that he loved
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; is John and James. The remaining 10,
[2:23:02] Peter is there. Thomas is there. Mark is
[2:23:05] there. Barthome is there. Those 10 were
[2:23:09] displeased
[2:23:11] of the request of John and James.
[2:23:16] Hallelujah.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; In the word of God,
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; it's not about a huge number what the
[2:23:26] people say this and this, but it's about
[2:23:30] those that stood for the cause of the
[2:23:33] Lord Jesus Christ. That's what matters.
[2:23:37] That is why the words of the pastor are
[2:23:40] still hollering in my ear.
[2:23:49] Pastor said when I start few when it
[2:23:53] come to an end there will be few
[2:24:01] go and plan but let your plan be the
[2:24:05] plan of God if is the plan of you
[2:24:08] without God I'm not
[2:24:16] I wanted to tell you about the journey
[2:24:19] of Peter
[2:24:21] uh Paulo
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Apollo
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; but is for other day but with this 10
[2:24:29] today my message is about the plan
[2:24:33] that will go beyond the plan of men and
[2:24:37] when I preparing the message just give
[2:24:40] me 10 and two 10 and two and 10 and two.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; History.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; Repeat itself.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; You can kill the body
[2:24:54] and the spirit, but my soul is in
[2:24:57] Christ.
[2:24:58] If your soul is in Christ, that's what
[2:25:02] matters.
[2:25:04] Amen.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; I won't toy against the word of God,
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; but I will align with the word of God.
[2:25:15] And if someone is going to hell,
[2:25:20] brothers and sisters, God has planned
[2:25:22] that can change it.
[2:25:26] Unfortunately,
[2:25:28] there are creatures. They are creatures
[2:25:32] of hell in the church.
[2:25:40] Be careful of what you hear. Be careful
[2:25:45] what you speak.
[2:25:47] Listen to your conscience.
[2:25:58] I want to tell you this.
[2:26:02] I want to tell you this.
[2:26:04] You see
[2:26:06] there are time of talking. There are
[2:26:10] time of telling the truth.
[2:26:14] If you can find
[2:26:20] that person will just say no they are
[2:26:21] just making me do this.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Listen it
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; to your conscience.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; That's where God
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; speak to you.
[2:26:34] This woman
[2:26:36] is talking about a mother to John and
[2:26:41] James said to Jesus, "I want my son to
[2:26:46] be on your left."
[2:26:50] That request, it was aligned with the
[2:26:54] plan of God. It happened exactly like
[2:26:57] that.
[2:26:59] When you go to the city to come,
[2:27:03] you find them there at the right place
[2:27:06] that was said while they were here on
[2:27:09] earth. God has never made a mistake.
[2:27:13] When you go to the city to come, you
[2:27:16] will find 12 patriarchs
[2:27:20] 12 disciples. When you go in, you will
[2:27:25] find us,
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; the bride.
[2:27:34] Brother Brenham,
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; Brother
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; when he depart,
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; he was about to preach
[2:27:40] the message the trail of the serpent.
[2:27:46] Now I've read many people message
[2:27:48] believers complaining
[2:27:51] complaining why it was not preached why
[2:27:54] it was not preached wanted to hear that
[2:27:57] brothers and sisters the pastor has
[2:28:00] preached about it
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; I've heard some believers
[2:28:10] saying
[2:28:12] pastor could have been here
[2:28:15] and Tell us about the white stone
[2:28:18] interpretation.
[2:28:21] Hey, wake up. You are the white throne
[2:28:25] interpretation.
[2:28:27] Because when you go in the new city, you
[2:28:32] find yourself in the pyramid, being the
[2:28:35] bride of Jesus Christ. You know what
[2:28:38] people think.
[2:28:40] They don't allow God to go with his
[2:28:43] plan. They go with their own thinking in
[2:28:47] the word of God. That is why we fail.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; God has never made a mistake to take our
[2:28:55] pastor.
[2:28:57] If you don't know, he told me,
[2:29:01] he said, "Bra,
[2:29:03] I'm going."
[2:29:06] And he's gone because God has planned
[2:29:10] it.
[2:29:12] What was the plan of God? At the right
[2:29:15] time, the appointed time to take a man
[2:29:18] of God.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:29:41] I I haven't seen
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; God making a mistake. No
[2:29:50] many wise that we have we have the
[2:29:53] answers
[2:29:55] I'm going to stop my message here this
[2:29:58] morning but I just want to tell the
[2:30:02] church I'll speak something
[2:30:05] but in front of the church
[2:30:08] there's many things but I just want to
[2:30:11] thank
[2:30:13] Omar Omar
[2:30:20] I was in the hospital with the pastor
[2:30:23] until he depart. Then something came to
[2:30:27] me that when brother Brenham did things
[2:30:31] still did not was not going well
[2:30:34] and God said to him, "Your wife is
[2:30:38] disrespectful.
[2:30:39] I'm going to kill her."
[2:30:41] Brother Brandham said to God, "You will
[2:30:44] never kill my wife because this woman is
[2:30:47] looking after me. He's looking after my
[2:30:50] kids. He's looking after my diet. He's
[2:30:53] looking after everything. He's
[2:30:55] supporting this ministry." And God,
[2:30:58] I want to tell church this morning,
[2:31:01] you're just looking at the pastor, but
[2:31:03] you are not looking at the woman behind
[2:31:05] the pastor who was looking after the
[2:31:08] diet of the pastor. When the pastor was
[2:31:11] dressing well, it's because of the
[2:31:13] woman. I I I'll just say in front of the
[2:31:15] church, you did a good job, mama,
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; and may God richly bless you with what
[2:31:20] you did. Amen.
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:50] Amen.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; Let's clap hands for the Lord.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; My brother, God bless you.
[2:32:07] Amen. Amen. H Let's stand on our feet.
[2:32:12] The sisters will give us a song.
[2:32:16] We have a baptismal service.
[2:32:21] So before the baptismal service,
[2:32:24] I will ask
[2:32:29] just to come forth for a word of prayer.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; Give us a song. God bless you.
[2:32:46] Oh

[2:34:01] Dear heavenly father, thou creator of
[2:34:04] all heavens, the earth and everything
[2:34:08] around.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; Father, we want to raise our hands,
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; our hearts, our souls, our spirits unto
[2:34:16] thee.

[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; who spoke in the beginning. Hallelujah.
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; Which was the spoken word which was the
[2:34:35] seed. Lord
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; in these last days you are still
[2:34:39] speaking to us.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord for coming mightily
[2:34:45] showing and expressing yourself. Lord
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; vindicating
[2:34:50] that this word of God comes direct from
[2:34:52] you.
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; This afternoon
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; we are raising our hands, our hearts
[2:34:58] unto thee. Thanking you Lord
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; for making brother Kareta our elder here
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; to stand and deliver the word
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; as it was in those days Lord
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; when Israel was saying Joshua will
[2:35:15] listen to you only
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; if the God who was with Moses
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; is with you Lord
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; Father we thank you this afternoon
[2:35:28] the very same God
[2:35:30] who created everything. Lord,
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; things that are visible and the things
[2:35:35] that are invisible.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; God who showed the visions and dreams
[2:35:40] and interpreted
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; in those days in the days of Joseph
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; and you said Joseph was anointed with
[2:35:48] the spirit of Christ.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; He was perfectly Lord
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; and he demonstrated every word that was
[2:35:56] written about him.
[2:35:58] And in the days of our Lord Jesus, it
[2:36:01] was the same ministry Lord
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; with the first pool, third pool
[2:36:06] and Lord in the last days again through
[2:36:09] the ministry
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; that you gave to the prophet of our day.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet as you have promised
[2:36:18] that spirit five times Lord.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; It happened exactly according to your
[2:36:23] word.
[2:36:26] And Lord, all along we're saying and
[2:36:29] telling the whole world that after that
[2:36:31] great ministry, there was also a man in
[2:36:34] Africa,

[2:54:41] same Jesus, whom he have crucified, both
[2:54:44] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[2:54:47] this, they were pricricked in their
[2:54:48] heart, and said unto Peter, and to the
[2:54:51] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[2:54:53] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[2:54:56] them, "Repent and be baptized, every one
[2:55:00] of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[2:55:02] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[2:55:04] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[2:55:07] the promise is unto you and to your
[2:55:09] children, and to all that are a far off,
