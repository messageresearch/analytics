[20:09] Scripture here I will read this
[20:14] scripture chapter
[20:18] 18 and the Lord said shall I hide from
[20:24] Abraham the thing which I
[20:27] do that
[20:29] Abraham shall surely become a great and
[20:33] mighty nation amen and all the nations
[20:37] of the Earth shall be blessed in him
[20:41] amen
[20:42] for listen for I know
[20:48] him H I believe how glad was
[20:56] Abraham listening to to God Amen
[21:00] saying I know
[21:06] Abraham that he will
[21:09] command his
[21:11] children amen amen as we are the Seed of
[21:17] Abraham after
[21:19] him and they shall keep the way of the
[21:26] Lord yes amen
[21:29] and I remember the first
[21:33] time
[21:35] reading that part that says behold I
[21:38] will send to Elijah the
[21:44] prophet and he shall turn their
[21:50] hearts the heart of the
[21:52] children back to their
[21:56] fathers there that's why this
[21:59] morning you
[22:02] are the
[22:07] heart not
[22:11] Hearts he said the
[22:16] heart so the bride has one
[22:22] heart that's
[22:25] why we remain
[22:31] one in him because we are a
[22:39] heart for I know
[22:43] him what a wonderful thing to be known
[22:46] of
[22:50] God that he will
[22:56] Command right
[22:58] [Music]
[22:59] amen it was a time like our
[23:04] time that's why he continued to
[23:10] say and for I know him that he will
[23:15] command his children and his household
[23:18] after
[23:23] him that is Abraham and they shall keep
[23:27] the way of the Lord
[23:29] to do justice and
[23:32] judgment that the Lord may bring upon
[23:38] Abraham that which H he has spoken of
[23:44] him God has spoken
[23:48] something of
[23:56] you
[24:01] and because
[24:04] God is the keeper of his own
[24:11] way he's not like
[24:16] men if God says
[24:19] something he's going to keep that
[24:25] way then he said
[24:29] and the Lord said because the Cry of
[24:34] Sodom and Gora is
[24:39] great and because their sin is very
[24:45] Grievous I will go
[24:48] down when you see
[24:51] God coming
[24:56] himself
[25:01] yes I
[25:03] will I
[25:05] will go
[25:09] down and
[25:14] see he stood
[25:17] up to come
[25:21] down like in this age of
[25:25] [Music]
[25:26] ours the
[25:29] Lord stood
[25:31] up to come
[25:36] down because he
[25:39] says where to see whether they have
[25:43] done all together according to the
[25:54] cry the sin of
[25:56] men
[25:58] the sinful
[26:01] life of men whom he
[26:05] created to worship Him caused him to
[26:09] come
[26:12] down to see whether they have done Al
[26:16] together according to the Cry of
[26:22] it which come unto
[26:26] me
[26:31] uh what is what what is God receiving
[26:35] this morning from us
[26:38] [Music]
[26:41] here and if not I will
[26:45] know then they maintain their
[26:49] phases from things and went towards
[26:53] Sodom but
[26:55] Abraham stood before before the
[27:00] Lord and He draw
[27:05] near amen amen you know if we look at
[27:09] this
[27:11] age and uh we see the Lord
[27:16] God that he has come
[27:19] down we should draw
[27:25] near but it say
[27:30] and the Lord said shall I
[27:33] hide from Abraham the thing that I
[27:38] do you may be seated God bless
[27:42] you so that's why this
[27:45] morning God could not hide from
[27:53] us that's
[27:55] why we will see
[27:59] the
[28:01] flying amen amen you know I I was
[28:06] looking for this book this
[28:11] morning H because in the
[28:15] pyramid there was a white
[28:22] stone and we'll still come to that
[28:29] after touching
[28:31] this this
[28:33] morning but there
[28:36] is time tested
[28:40] memorials time tested memorials before

[28:54] off you you know what is in that in this
[28:57] book
[29:03] and you know I'm I'm talking I'm going
[29:06] to talk to you about the thing you are
[29:08] familiar
[29:13] with there was this
[29:16] man do you say his
[29:19] architect
[29:21] yes amen
[29:23] amen and uh an American
[29:31] from all over the
[29:34] world Bridge
[29:39] Builders when the people were afraid of
[29:43] a
[29:44] job to build a a
[29:49] bridge across the
[29:53] sea and uh then this man came
[29:59] because all those who came before
[30:03] him they could just go down up to the
[30:12] S and they all went
[30:15] back to
[30:17] say we can't build a
[30:20] bridge because down there it
[30:24] [Music]
[30:26] sent and
[30:29] then then came another
[30:33] man who knew
[30:36] that and set of his
[30:45] reputation he said say I'm not afraid to
[30:48] take the
[30:52] job and I realize
[30:55] that I have
[30:57] a worldwide
[31:02] reputation I don't know how you regard
[31:08] yourself you know as church
[31:13] goers we used to
[31:18] say just
[31:26] also he testifies he doesn't say
[31:29] that he talks of what we are
[31:34] amen now if you talk to
[31:38] somebody and
[31:41] say also
[31:44] we says me
[31:47] too is just weak weak people now we come
[31:51] to a
[31:54] place
[31:55] where we can
[32:00] manifest because we can't talk about the
[32:03] power of
[32:05] God and turn again around and speak
[32:08] about the weakness
[32:13] of God is not
[32:16] weak and if you believe him you'll never
[32:21] be
[32:24] weak amen
[32:27] I remember when I was told
[32:31] about two
[32:35] M where one
[32:38] neighbor was walking
[32:41] around it was in the morning and then
[32:43] she was busy looking
[32:46] around now she sees the
[32:49] [Music]
[32:50] neighbor like this CH the
[32:56] Sun amen
[32:59] amen he says how are
[33:04] you says hi we are fine it's just the
[33:07] devil is oppressing
[33:10] us as a Christian now this one as a
[33:14] Christian
[33:16] said I am also all
[33:19] right but
[33:21] God the blood of Jesus Christ has freed
[33:25] me has taken me out of the grip of the
[33:30] devil that's
[33:33] whyu I sing
[33:35] hallelujah amen
[33:38] amen you can start
[33:43] singing
[33:46] amen
[33:48] h i don't spend the time that I I
[33:55] have is for the word of
[33:59] God all right even last night yeah all
[34:04] this
[34:05] time that is the
[34:07] time I don't have time for cell
[34:11] phone I'm just wait for a
[34:15] call when calling
[34:17] somebody that's
[34:19] all the time is for the word
[34:24] of because cell phone pass
[34:29] away the
[34:33] people people with eternal
[34:36] life are
[34:39] concentrating on things that are
[34:43] [Music]
[34:46] Eternal your
[34:49] life speaks louder than your
[34:55] mouth
[34:58] amen
[34:59] amen so now
[35:03] here now you've heard what God Said
[35:06] shall I
[35:07] hide from Abraham the thing that do I
[35:15] do so what a wonderful
[35:18] God who shall never
[35:22] hide from
[35:24] you the things that
[35:27] he
[35:31] do that's why I
[35:35] know we know to worship
[35:39] him and I
[35:41] know the place of
[35:46] worship all right amen
[35:51] now now this
[35:55] man I I won't take time on
[36:01] this it says oh blessed be the
[36:06] Lord that that's the reason
[36:08] that there is a heaven to go
[36:13] to that's the reason we can have a
[36:19] reputation as a
[36:21] Christian we know that material is in
[36:25] this building
[36:29] that's right so let's take this man and
[36:33] finish
[36:35] amen now that man he said I will take
[36:40] this
[36:43] job I wonder you two this
[36:48] morning if the word is
[36:52] preached whether you will take say I
[36:56] will take this
[36:59] job as a
[37:02] Christian because some have
[37:04] failed now God today is looking for the
[37:09] people who will never fail like the
[37:11] other
[37:17] people
[37:20] because the one who has
[37:23] failed still
[37:25] profess
[37:28] to be the bread of
[37:30] Christ but what about this
[37:36] hatred so if you profess to be a
[37:41] Christian but you hate your
[37:45] brother the Bible says you are
[37:54] like a cane in the message
[38:02] if you hate your
[38:04] brother and you say I'm in the
[38:06] message you are a can in the
[38:12] message but the message is not in
[38:19] you all right
[38:24] Amen in the message
[38:27] instead of you being in the message let
[38:29] the
[38:30] [Music]
[38:33] message let the message be in
[38:38] you amen today you can
[38:41] swap amen
[38:45] amen you take the
[38:48] message and the message to be in you
[38:52] then nature so that the nature amen can
[38:57] come
[38:58] up that's why
[39:01] I I can read you this part here I was
[39:06] looking at
[39:08] it
[39:10] and for the Bible says the true
[39:15] worshiper shall worship
[39:18] God
[39:24] in it didn't say in m
[39:30] in
[39:32] spirit don't Worship in
[39:35] M Worship in
[39:40] spirit and
[39:45] Truth uh I was reading
[39:49] here about the soul
[39:52] soul as you say my soul say yes
[40:01] the prophet says
[40:04] here you are soul body and
[40:10] spirit but it
[40:13] takes uh the three to make
[40:22] you if
[40:25] then
[40:27] there is Father Son and Holy
[40:32] Ghost but it speaks of one
[40:39] person now if you are
[40:44] Spirit soul and
[40:48] body it makes you
[40:55] one but the
[40:58] key here is the
[41:03] soul you know the prophet
[41:08] say
[41:10] soul
[41:12] body
[41:14] and
[41:18] spirit he says actually the
[41:22] soul that's where you
[41:25] live
[41:27] amen now I'll show you this
[41:31] ministry of the end
[41:34] time that God came
[41:38] down he has seen the conditional in this
[41:44] world and he has come
[41:47] down all right as he said shall I hide
[41:52] from
[41:54] Abraham the thing that I
[41:59] do
[42:01] okay I read
[42:05] here
[42:07] uh I just want to finish this
[42:16] part when we talk about
[42:20] changing uh it says here it speaks of
[42:23] the
[42:25] nature
[42:27] the soul is the nature of your
[42:30] [Music]
[42:34] spirit you know you can't beat your
[42:41] nature if the
[42:44] soul is not in
[42:49] you you'll
[42:52] continue you can talk about God
[42:58] Christianity but
[43:00] yet you still need to be
[43:07] changed now I
[43:11] read it is your soul that been
[43:19] changed amen the old soul
[43:25] died
[43:26] and the new
[43:28] Soul which is the new
[43:31] nature was born into
[43:33] [Music]
[43:36] you you can't worship god with the your
[43:39] old
[43:43] soul it should
[43:45] be your
[43:50] soul then it says your
[43:54] brain is is not your
[43:58] intelligence page 676 c
[44:02] o
[44:07] 6 usually
[44:11] say this child has a
[44:18] brain even when he
[44:23] takes as long as he can show
[44:27] Flames they say this child has brain
[44:30] wise
[44:31] child a wise child is a child who fears
[44:41] God education don't make you
[44:45] wise the wisdom of
[44:47] God what is the wisdom
[44:53] of
[44:54] yes it's says it is the
[44:58] first
[45:03] wisdom your brain is not your
[45:08] intelligence it's the spirit that's in
[45:13] you is your
[45:16] intelligence your brain is a bunch of
[45:19] matter cells and so
[45:24] forth amen amen but God do not look at
[45:29] your
[45:30] brain but he looks inside of your
[45:35] heart where there is
[45:41] soul
[45:44] now I'm trying to take to say
[45:47] this this is the last thing yeah it is
[45:51] your soul that's being
[45:54] changed
[45:56] you know if the soul is not
[46:01] Chang you remain with your old
[46:05] nature amen

[1:01:55] uh let me read to you something here mm
[1:01:59] uh page
[1:02:02] 534
[1:02:04] 534 uh it speaks
[1:02:08] of five did I say 534
[1:02:14] yes it tells me
[1:02:18] that from back from Genesis
[1:02:23] there this
[1:02:25] seventh
[1:02:27] seal is spoken
[1:02:32] of
[1:02:34] now
[1:02:37] if uh sometimes they
[1:02:40] sayy you are still KN in the
[1:02:45] message the bride of Christ is not new
[1:02:48] in the
[1:02:52] message you get what I mean amen because
[1:02:56] this
[1:02:57] seal this
[1:02:59] seven this seven
[1:03:02] seal spoken
[1:03:05] of from the
[1:03:09] beginning
[1:03:12] in this
[1:03:16] seventh now if the Bible
[1:03:20] says you were
[1:03:22] there before the foundation of
[1:03:25] the then you should know the
[1:03:31] seven because the seven is the end
[1:03:35] that's why H it is spoken of
[1:03:43] from amen amen and the Seven seal spoken
[1:03:49] of from the
[1:03:53] beginning
[1:03:57] now that which was from the
[1:04:02] beginning which we
[1:04:05] have
[1:04:14] head that which
[1:04:17] was now if the seventh seal was
[1:04:22] there that which was from
[1:04:30] beginning yeah was from the beginning
[1:04:34] which we have heard which we have seen
[1:04:37] with our eyes amen which we have looked
[1:04:40] upon and our hands have handled of the
[1:04:42] weight of life
[1:04:45] amen
[1:04:47] amen the things that we
[1:04:50] hear today is the things we have heard
[1:04:56] that's the difference between just a
[1:05:02] believer and
[1:05:04] somebody as he
[1:05:06] says that which we have
[1:05:11] head that's
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:16] p and which we
[1:05:20] have sin amen amen right amen amen
[1:05:25] continue what about what which we have
[1:05:28] heard and have
[1:05:31] seen what are you going to do with
[1:05:34] that which we have looked upon and our
[1:05:37] hands have handled of the word of life
[1:05:40] for the life was manifested and we have
[1:05:43] seen it and bear witness and show unto
[1:05:47] you that eternal life which was with the
[1:05:50] father and was manifested all right all
[1:05:53] right all right all right
[1:05:56] meaning we
[1:05:59] are preaching to
[1:06:02] you showing
[1:06:05] you
[1:06:08] that eternal
[1:06:13] life because what saves you
[1:06:18] today it's not a thing that is
[1:06:22] coming is that
[1:06:28] and the Bible says we have seen
[1:06:34] it have you seen eternal
[1:06:39] life all right that
[1:06:47] which
[1:06:49] was that's
[1:06:52] why if you are predis
[1:06:55] you are not struggling with
[1:07:01] cigarette or a young man running with
[1:07:05] girls he was not
[1:07:09] there those who were
[1:07:12] there amen you know the seventh SE is
[1:07:16] for those who were
[1:07:20] there because all the way back
[1:07:28] fromis or Genesis
[1:07:32] Genesis is that so
[1:07:34] amen okay whatever you say
[1:07:39] Amen the
[1:07:41] seveny is spoken
[1:07:43] of
[1:07:49] from now there are those who are trying
[1:07:54] to catch up with
[1:07:57] it but there are those who came with
[1:08:05] it if you have eternal
[1:08:08] [Music]
[1:08:10] life you have received
[1:08:13] it back
[1:08:18] there because
[1:08:21] Revelation is something that r
[1:08:25] [Music]
[1:08:26] that which we
[1:08:29] [Music]
[1:08:33] have what is revealed to
[1:08:37] me is that which I have
[1:08:44] heard and I have
[1:08:46] seen and have
[1:08:50] handled
[1:08:52] amen
[1:08:55] the seventh seal cannot be
[1:08:58] preached by
[1:09:00] somebody who has noted the seven
[1:09:05] SE because it speaks for
[1:09:16] itself that's why
[1:09:18] it now from
[1:09:22] the
[1:09:25] the very beginning in Genesis the sth
[1:09:33] SE now
[1:09:36] if you have begun
[1:09:40] today you are
[1:09:43] late because the
[1:09:45] seven
[1:09:52] from now if if it is from
[1:09:55] there those who are there are not
[1:09:59] looking for the seven
[1:10:05] se you see because that seven
[1:10:10] SE is from
[1:10:14] there now go back to the
[1:10:20] bookis
[1:10:22] Genesis all right
[1:10:25] let's go
[1:10:26] there
[1:10:28] amen I don't
[1:10:31] think you'll be
[1:10:35] satisfied to receive a
[1:10:39] message from the person that was not
[1:10:49] there I think as the prophet has said
[1:10:52] here
[1:10:55] if you are
[1:10:57] predestinated you need a predestinated
[1:11:04] pastor otherwise it
[1:11:13] won that's
[1:11:16] why uh you know we are here I can't
[1:11:21] worship any
[1:11:24] I I can't go to any other
[1:11:29] place I was not
[1:11:35] born is that
[1:11:40] right
[1:11:43] if even
[1:11:47] now you hear some people
[1:11:50] saying you know I want to go to the
[1:11:52] United States
[1:11:54] United States just to change
[1:11:59] places all right but I don't
[1:12:04] think I will have a better life if I go
[1:12:08] to United States
[1:12:14] states because I'm not going to United
[1:12:17] States United States I am going to
[1:12:21] heaven that's the difference
[1:12:27] that is the place as we are so
[1:12:30] generous United States United States I

[1:13:44] existence coming

[1:13:58] imagine you take some
[1:14:02] thousands
[1:14:05] kilometers just to greet

[1:16:58] Us in
[1:17:01] America in
[1:17:03] M no in
[1:17:06] him where are you
[1:17:08] from you you are from
[1:17:14] him there was no place where he could
[1:17:18] go and choose
[1:17:21] you but the only
[1:17:24] place amen amen he looked into
[1:17:30] himself we we were in
[1:17:33] him that great
[1:17:35] soul that great being a mighty
[1:17:40] God tells you that he has chosen
[1:17:46] [Applause]
[1:17:48] you in
[1:17:51] him amen
[1:17:54] you know this can cause you to run up
[1:17:56] and
[1:17:59] down
[1:18:01] chosen by the almighty
[1:18:05] God what did you see in
[1:18:08] me because he wanted
[1:18:11] you to be like
[1:18:15] [Applause]
[1:18:19] him you know this word can keep you
[1:18:22] forever
[1:18:26] chosen
[1:18:28] you in
[1:18:30] him read it
[1:18:34] again according as he have chosen Us in
[1:18:37] him before the foundation of the world
[1:18:41] Listen
[1:18:43] [Music]
[1:18:45] before the
[1:18:48] foundation you are
[1:18:51] already chosen
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:57] when when he
[1:19:00] h created the
[1:19:03] Earth you were
[1:19:08] watching from
[1:19:14] him that's
[1:19:17] why the things of the
[1:19:21] world cannot
[1:19:25] take you away from
[1:19:28] him because you
[1:19:32] existed before there were things of the
[1:19:36] [Applause]
[1:19:43] world all
[1:19:45] right
[1:19:49] Chen where Lord in him
[1:19:55] before the
[1:19:57] foundation of the
[1:20:01] world
[1:20:03] meaning you have seen the
[1:20:06] world before you were born
[1:20:12] born you have seen the
[1:20:16] word now your Supernatural nature
[1:20:23] knows about the things of the
[1:20:27] world and that's why you'll shine
[1:20:31] them because you were before
[1:20:37] [Applause]
[1:20:41] them and then you hear them people
[1:20:44] saying the sin is controlling him if you
[1:20:47] were chosen in
[1:20:48] him that was before there was any sin
[1:20:54] now who came who was the first to
[1:20:58] come was it sin or
[1:21:04] you
[1:21:05] so that's why you can be controlled by
[1:21:10] sin because you were chosen before there
[1:21:14] were
[1:21:17] sin you have power over
[1:21:20] s because you were before
[1:21:24] s you have tasted
[1:21:29] eternity so how can you live in
[1:21:33] sin because you have tasted
[1:21:38] eternity when God said let there be you
[1:21:42] were watching from
[1:21:47] him you were before
[1:21:51] that
[1:21:53] you can be
[1:21:54] ruled or overcome but something that
[1:21:59] came after you
[1:22:04] exist a wish was not
[1:22:10] there because if she was
[1:22:13] there she cannot become a
[1:22:18] witch because he says that we have heard
[1:22:24] Hall
[1:22:26] from wichcraft came
[1:22:34] after which where is your
[1:22:40] soul but the soul of the
[1:22:43] Sons and Daughters of
[1:22:46] God came from
[1:22:49] [Applause]
[1:22:51] him
[1:22:53] before there was any
[1:22:57] [Music]
[1:22:59] sin that's why it says he that is born
[1:23:02] of
[1:23:03] God cannot
[1:23:08] sin why because he has the nature of his
[1:23:17] father the Bible
[1:23:19] says he that is is
[1:23:23] born of
[1:23:26] God you know I read in the
[1:23:29] book where the Prophet
[1:23:32] says
[1:23:35] God gave
[1:23:38] C God gave
[1:23:41] be to
[1:23:46] himself when he be he came as
[1:23:51] Jesus he after he gave
[1:23:57] birth then he comes as
[1:24:00] Jesus and say
[1:24:04] before the world
[1:24:06] was before Abraham
[1:24:10] was I
[1:24:13] am he says now
[1:24:17] because the Seed of
[1:24:19] Abraham that's why he says
[1:24:22] shall I hide from
[1:24:26] Abraham knowing that he
[1:24:31] will amen amen so all these
[1:24:36] beings were in
[1:24:40] him and
[1:24:43] today they
[1:24:46] are they
[1:24:48] are you can say this man is
[1:24:53] the message
[1:24:58] believer what is the
[1:25:02] message everything anything can be a
[1:25:08] message even denying God is a
[1:25:14] message even denying the is a
[1:25:20] message no you can be in any kind of a
[1:25:29] message but your
[1:25:32] nature cannot deny
[1:25:40] you as I said the last
[1:25:44] time he who hates his
[1:25:51] brother
[1:25:53] the Bible doesn't
[1:25:56] say if he hates this
[1:26:00] brother because of this and
[1:26:03] that
[1:26:05] no hatred is
[1:26:09] hat from the
[1:26:15] devil from
[1:26:18] Satan if you hate your sister your
[1:26:24] brother even now as I am
[1:26:28] speaking you've got the reason
[1:26:36] why but the Bible doesn't speak of
[1:26:40] reasons it speaks of
[1:26:45] hatred he doesn't want any
[1:26:48] reason he says love those
[1:27:01] amen
[1:27:02] amen now God will not force you he
[1:27:07] says I am saying love them that hate you
[1:27:13] no he is speaking to those who were in
[1:27:19] him but those that were in
[1:27:22] him he can
[1:27:25] say
[1:27:29] love
[1:27:31] because they came from
[1:27:35] him he gave them a
[1:27:39] nature Peter says he gave
[1:27:43] us
[1:27:46] Divine divine nature is not
[1:27:51] something
[1:27:52] is not something that you go around
[1:27:57] reading I tell you I know of many money
[1:28:08] lovers I know
[1:28:10] them money
[1:28:13] lovers they doesn't they don't want to
[1:28:15] part
[1:28:21] with whether he has a lot of money
[1:28:27] lovers
[1:28:29] and she or he can rob
[1:28:39] you when you say where do you worship
[1:28:41] Fellowship my brother and you
[1:28:45] say but why don't you pay that brother
[1:28:49] now the problem came
[1:28:55] he is not fellowshipping in Christ he is
[1:29:00] fellowshipping don't
[1:29:03] Fellowship Fellowship in
[1:29:09] Christ in
[1:29:11] closing there were two sisters I met
[1:29:14] them
[1:29:17] in waking at the
[1:29:20] DRL
[1:29:22] they
[1:29:23] said to
[1:29:25] me
[1:29:29] brother do you
[1:29:31] know
[1:29:35] brother and I knew
[1:29:38] already why they ask me that question
[1:29:42] because we knew the
[1:29:45] brother this week is a
[1:29:48] Christian next week is
[1:29:50] something so they met him when now he
[1:29:54] was something
[1:29:58] else amen actually he is not a
[1:30:03] Christian but he can
[1:30:06] act
[1:30:12] Christianity like the
[1:30:16] people
[1:30:20] those they only love those that love
[1:30:25] them exchange gifts exchanging gifts and
[1:30:29] things but
[1:30:30] only fa to those that love
[1:30:35] them you know a Christian I have learned
[1:30:38] even
[1:30:46] something the Bible says do not lie in
[1:30:50] different way lying comes in in
[1:30:52] different ways a a person comes to
[1:30:58] you say my dad I have nothing don't you
[1:31:02] have five friends he say ah nothing
[1:31:06] you're
[1:31:11] lying you rather
[1:31:13] say I have it
[1:31:18] but I'm just going to use it for
[1:31:21] something else
[1:31:22] but if you say I don't
[1:31:25] have this how you
[1:31:29] mean not
[1:31:32] even telling
[1:31:39] lies tell him the
[1:31:43] truth I just but if I have it I give
[1:31:49] him I won't lose anything blessed is the
[1:31:55] hand that
[1:32:04] give
[1:32:07] blessed
[1:32:09] amen I was with the brother in his
[1:32:14] here
[1:32:16] at moral
[1:32:18] somewh and here comes a man
[1:32:22] coming and
[1:32:29] said at
[1:32:31] home I left my wife and
[1:32:38] kids I can't find job so and
[1:32:43] so I left the wife and
[1:32:47] children and
[1:32:50] then
[1:32:53] having nothing not even
[1:32:55] bread
[1:33:02] now we looked at him together with the
[1:33:08] brother we realize that it's not not a
[1:33:13] he's actually saying the
[1:33:16] truth so
[1:33:19] now because we were in the shop will
[1:33:22] pick up some things pick up a few
[1:33:26] things now he
[1:33:29] says how do how do
[1:33:32] know I I don't want to
[1:33:35] know what I know when we looked
[1:33:38] at we saw that this man is telling the
[1:33:42] truth
[1:33:45] amen he just
[1:33:48] said I was saying he was saying if you
[1:33:50] could just buy me something that I can
[1:33:52] go give the
[1:33:54] children
[1:33:57] so
[1:33:59] and now if we could have said we don't
[1:34:03] have
[1:34:07] money now we were supposed to confess to
[1:34:10] say you remember we said lies to that
[1:34:19] woman when are you going to start
[1:34:22] confessing such going around telling
[1:34:28] people just
[1:34:32] as because you love
[1:34:41] money when they
[1:34:43] go he actually make sure that he doesn't
[1:34:45] carry money
[1:34:49] with he wants to be true
[1:34:52] when he meets
[1:34:56] people he goes
[1:34:59] out so that when he says I don't have he
[1:35:03] has is at
[1:35:05] home but he says now here with me I
[1:35:08] don't
[1:35:09] [Music]
[1:35:11] have he's keeping it at home to avoid
[1:35:14] the very
[1:35:15] situation the Love of Money the root of
[1:35:19] all land
[1:35:29] it is the one that causes money
[1:35:37] rituals even babies are no
[1:35:41] because this money
[1:35:46] lovers they
[1:35:48] make uh an agreement
[1:35:58] with them that a child like this if you
[1:36:02] can bring
[1:36:06] them now a person goes and kills for
[1:36:11] challeng for money the people who do not
[1:36:14] know
[1:36:20] God that's it
[1:36:23] amen they've already

[1:37:20] night go
[1:37:26] because we could not sleep without
[1:37:31] completing here it is I haven't touched
[1:37:36] it the brother can see it
[1:37:39] amen amen now you don't know the ways of
[1:37:43] God but we
[1:37:46] come with the
[1:37:49] end of the seven
[1:37:53] SE we are going to read
[1:37:57] it not
[1:38:00] to saying to those that are waiting for
[1:38:04] it to be
[1:38:05] revealed the end of it but we are only
[1:38:08] going to look at the end of it it even
[1:38:12] [Music]
[1:38:13] ends all
[1:38:19] things that's when
[1:38:22] will pick
[1:38:24] up this flying
[1:38:31] interpretation our the interpretation
[1:38:36] interpretation that the bride has
[1:38:39] received you'll see what it
[1:38:43] means flying when we talk of the
[1:38:48] flying I took it from my Prophet
[1:38:54] here
[1:38:55] when he received
[1:38:58] that
[1:39:07] fly it's not
[1:39:10] from it's not from Amica it's
[1:39:13] flying interpretation fly interpretation
[1:39:17] wait until we come we know we went
[1:39:20] through it
[1:39:22] but we've got it
[1:39:24] here and we'll even
[1:39:28] visit we'll see who is this new t
[1:39:35] one among the
[1:39:37] Angels but there's one the
[1:39:41] notable then there's again here the
[1:39:46] angel with the seventh seal
[1:39:53] with
[1:39:55] amen it is here but God not want me to
[1:40:00] touch
[1:40:01] it
[1:40:03] today I he wanted for I think a
[1:40:10] preparation amen am then we'll come to
[1:40:13] that God bless
[1:40:16] you amen
[1:40:19] amen
[1:40:21] [Applause]
[1:40:23] H I want to
[1:40:27] sing I used
[1:40:30] to lead a
[1:40:33] [Music]
[1:40:36] choir and a
[1:40:39] CET
[1:40:42] M but since then I don't know I see my
[1:40:47] voice
[1:40:49] voice if I were want to sing my voice
[1:40:53] goes that
[1:40:55] way then I thought
[1:40:58] maybe because we have brothers and
[1:41:03] sisters uh my
[1:41:06] voice wants me to stop
[1:41:10] singing and
[1:41:13] listen when you
[1:41:16] sing I love the way you
[1:41:19] sing but I no longer
[1:41:22] sing like I used
[1:41:24] to I don't know the I don't know the
[1:41:29] reason maybe I sometimes think
[1:41:33] maybe it is because where we are
[1:41:37] going hey the music
[1:41:40] there so I think
[1:41:44] maybe the
[1:41:46] Lord has started to change my
[1:41:49] voice
[1:41:55] there's going to be praisings there
[1:41:58] until the prophet says if you don't love
[1:42:04] noise don't go
[1:42:14] there there is no law that
[1:42:18] says I want you to be is
[1:42:22] soft
[1:42:28] singing you can't control
[1:42:32] it that's why King
[1:42:35] David you know you know a king is
[1:42:38] someone that is respected amen
[1:42:42] amen but King
[1:42:45] David when they were
