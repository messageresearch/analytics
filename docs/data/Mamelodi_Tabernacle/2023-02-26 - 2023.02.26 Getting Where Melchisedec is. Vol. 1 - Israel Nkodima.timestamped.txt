[53:14] don't miss this
[53:16] the communion he gave
[53:23] that was part of himself
[53:30] he gave
[53:32] Abraham communion was not just a church
[53:38] that was part of himself
[53:45] then we will see it like that is
[54:02] you know if God if you are a child he
[54:07] only yeah
[54:11] God gives himself
[54:14] [Music]
[54:22] for the bloodline to remain
[54:28] amen amen
[54:30] he doesn't
[54:32] give a portion something
[54:35] yeah
[54:37] that's why he says
[54:51] so much that I am in you
[54:57] part of me myself
[55:01] that's what she said
[55:04] okay amen you know this morning
[55:10] you know that's what we call Grace okay
[55:15] Grace is that
[55:18] I am not
[55:20] begging amen
[55:21] [Music]
[55:27] [Music]
[55:30] the solution
[55:32] [Music]
[55:46] and follow me
[55:49] amen
[55:51] that's why he said
[55:53] I'm going to prepare you a city location
[56:19] we are whatever
[56:21] [Music]
[56:27] that's why
[56:30] for a visitation
[56:32] he knew the right family to visit amen
[56:40] the people who knew but and understood
[56:44] their relationships
[57:03] a little response
[57:15] his Supernatural senses
[57:23] than he he said this this is the place
[57:31] Abraham that's why
[57:35] he has heard that
[57:41] that maybe we can switch this one off
[57:44] amen I
[57:47] I hear the voice now starting to
[57:52] Abraham Abraham
[57:55] he had some
[57:59] there's a time when we bought a car
[58:04] and they said bye to me my friend but
[58:07] money should see this one has got senses
[58:11] in a lady senses
[58:13] energy
[58:15] when the rains it starts to fall here
[58:19] the wipe
[58:27] senses yes
[58:32] so now if you are a child of God
[58:36] you are fitted with Supernatural senses
[58:43] you know what is heaven
[58:50] you know what to do in time of trouble
[59:04] amen amen
[59:06] automatically
[59:07] [Music]
[59:10] that's why
[59:13] children of God
[59:14] you don't see them every day on a Prayer
[59:22] they are fitted with amen
[59:25] God is sense
[59:29] amen amen
[59:32] you can assist us okay I think they were
[59:35] four of them
[59:40] Witnesses being this man of God because
[59:46] I think it's two weeks back
[59:52] they came to the to my office amen
[1:00:00] one had problems with this and that um
[1:00:06] and uh
[1:00:07] and then one brother was saying
[1:00:11] um
[1:00:12] the man of God referring to me didn't
[1:00:15] even pray
[1:00:20] he only touched the leg of that system
[1:00:23] and
[1:00:27] yes it's coming from the witness
[1:00:29] yes
[1:00:34] we won because
[1:00:38] if we are the children of God
[1:00:43] we we are fitted
[1:00:45] with the supernatural ourselves
[1:00:51] is that right
[1:00:53] that's why even if you threaten usage
[1:00:58] we want we won't do the same thing
[1:01:12] David knew what to do in time of trouble
[1:01:15] yeah
[1:01:21] I mean

[1:49:33] amen yes
[1:49:37] yes
[1:49:47] amen amen amen Heavenly Father
[1:49:51] our pasta is one man
[1:49:55] whom you can stand behind the pulpit
[1:49:59] once you say shalom to the bride
[1:50:02] we could feel our hearts bubbles today
[1:50:07] amen amen we have always made him
[1:50:10] special
[1:50:15] we are always wondering who we are
[1:50:19] for such can be preached unto us
[1:50:23] not just the preaching as the message
[1:50:25] yes but when we have that deep
[1:50:28] understanding
[1:50:29] for Heavenly Father message has been
[1:50:32] preached to many and many at times amen
[1:50:35] but it takes a special message to reach
[1:50:38] the special people and for us to
[1:50:41] understand
[1:50:44] you cannot just do it from above but you
[1:50:47] need to condescend Upon Our Man amen
[1:50:50] amen we appreciate you so much yes sir
[1:50:54] for putting that message in the heart of
[1:50:57] our pastor amen so that we may connect
[1:50:59] with him amen amen for Father God we
[1:51:02] love you so much amen because you first
[1:51:04] love us amen Heavenly Father
[1:51:08] the message that has been preached today
[1:51:10] we see it better than the previous one
[1:51:13] meaning every time when you bring the
[1:51:17] message unto us it's like we are
[1:51:19] knocking at the Heaven's Door each and
[1:51:22] every time or any moment from now going
[1:51:25] forward we'll see ourselves in that
[1:51:28] better place amen we not gonna count yes
[1:51:32] no days or hours but any moment you may
[1:51:35] take us back home we love you so much as
[1:51:39] we were praying and appreciate your will
[1:51:42] this morning Heavenly Father the devil
[1:51:44] who are trying to do something to bring
[1:51:46] sickness to our pastor but you made him
[1:51:49] stand and praise to the people because
[1:51:52] Heavenly Father the Flesh and things of
[1:51:54] the flesh they are so temporal it takes
[1:51:58] the wet body to take us to another level
[1:52:01] we appreciate you so much you spoke to
[1:52:05] us in a special way for we are just
[1:52:08] special people oh Father God we want to
[1:52:11] thank you for what you are doing to us
[1:52:12] and every day when we leave this moment
[1:52:16] go into our respective places may we
[1:52:19] always meditate upon this way because
[1:52:22] brother Branham say Rapture is a process
[1:52:25] day by day little by little as we
[1:52:28] indulge ourselves in this weight we see
[1:52:31] you better we know you better you're
[1:52:34] drawing us nearer and you take us where
[1:52:36] we belong I know and I believe that we
[1:52:39] believe this message because it has
[1:52:41] prepared for us before the foundation of
[1:52:43] the world we are just working Lord upon
[1:52:46] the path that we have already prepared
[1:52:48] for us father God we love you so much
[1:53:12] Jesus Christ
