[9:43] blessing to be here
[9:46] the wrong way oh there we go uh it's a
[9:49] blessing to be here
[9:52] 's the fusing
[9:54] is it is it Audible
[9:59] oh I need to hold that closer is that
[10:01] better yeah
[10:02] I'll try to remember that
[10:04] um just a couple things I wanted to say
[10:07] I try to keep it brief
[10:10] I really was hoping that they would let
[10:13] me sit down here with these other
[10:14] brothers
[10:16] Jesus said you're supposed to take the
[10:18] lowest
[10:21] seats
[10:23] but I just I when I saw brother and
[10:28] Kadima the other day I said you know
[10:32] is a real sword and I said I am a real
[10:35] person
[10:39] I have a question
[10:45] and um
[10:47] you know there's different little
[10:48] sayings that we have in our country and
[10:51] um
[10:53] you may have heard and some of them may
[10:55] just be American but they have one and
[10:58] it it is the proof of the pudding
[11:02] pudding that you would eat the proof of
[11:04] the pudding is
[11:07] in the tasting there
[11:10] the tasting thereof so
[11:13] if I have a bowl of chocolate pudding
[11:16] and ice
[11:19] this is chocolate pudding
[11:22] your chocolate some other man says no oh
[11:25] my God that's better Scotch pudding uh
[11:28] yeah see I see a chocolate chip say well
[11:30] it's brown it's it's
[11:34] a pleasantry he says no they put
[11:37] coloring in it
[11:41] so I say okay so we'll settle this
[11:44] now I have four spoons here you want to
[11:48] give one to Mr critic
[11:50] and I have two other people here you are
[11:54] in this argument at all
[11:58] okay now take your spoon and take a
[12:01] scoop yeah
[12:27] there you go I told you it's chocolate
[12:30] pudding
[12:31] in the mouth of two or three Witnesses
[12:36] sometimes you have to have an actual
[12:39] reality
[12:44] and uh so if you shake hands with an
[12:49] imaginary non-existing person
[12:57] but uh some people just maybe didn't
[13:00] believe that yeah
[13:03] I think really that that's a very bad
[13:06] thing to say how about your pastor
[13:09] really
[13:11] some others that have said
[13:15] I want to also make mention of brother
[13:19] Larry Mims
[13:22] the last time I saw him
[13:26] asked me to
[13:28] degree
[13:35] he would be here if if he could
[13:38] foreign
[13:45] [Music]
[14:10] so there's southeast state is the United
[14:12] States
[14:13] South Asia United States and if you go
[14:17] at that State North there's there's land
[14:19] that runs along the coastline and that's
[14:22] called the panhandle of Florida
[14:28] right I mean and so I live on that pan
[14:31] here in a city called Fort Walton Beach
[14:38] and I live in a little Township that is
[14:41] right along houses
[14:45] brother Larry Mims
[14:47] lives in Alabama just across the uh line
[14:52] the state line going down
[14:57] he lives in a town called Brewton
[15:00] Alabama
[15:03] I try to shake his imaginary hand about
[15:06] once a month if I can okay
[15:13] we get together and uh
[15:22] and so it's a real blessing
[15:25] brother Mims is what I would call an
[15:29] Elder's elder brother
[15:32] and the reason that I say that
[15:36] because brother men's has had years in
[15:40] the past before he heard the message
[15:43] that he did some Evangelistic work in
[15:46] South America
[15:48] he has been in many of the meetings of
[15:52] the charismatics
[15:55] so he brings with him a certain amount
[15:59] of experience
[16:02] I mean
[16:04] now when we were having lunch here a few
[16:07] months back
[16:10] I told brother Larry I said
[16:13] I said you know I've got it in my heart
[16:15] to go to Africa
[16:17] I said I really want to go there brother
[16:21] Larry looks at me
[16:24] he says you you better make sure it's a
[16:26] will of God for you to
[16:28] you
[16:29] he said you better make sure of that
[16:31] well brother now brother Larry yeah I
[16:35] didn't realize brother Larry has been in
[16:37] dangerous circumstances
[16:41] here in this congregation but I'm
[16:44] talking about just he has been out among
[16:47] people in South America
[16:54] so in brother Larry's thinking he knows
[16:57] that I'm in good company here but he
[16:59] knows that I'm in a country where maybe
[17:01] I might not be safe if it wasn't for
[17:03] that
[17:16] he said you can be sure they'll be
[17:18] keeping a close eye on you at all times
[17:22] everybody has just been just wonderful
[17:27] foreign
[17:30] [Music]
[18:01] some of the people I have met here from
[18:04] the other day
[18:08] God bless you
[18:13] [Applause]
[18:13] [Music]
[18:15] say
[18:17] [Applause]
[18:21] all right

[18:32] we hope to see a brother Larry memes one

[18:52] his food

[18:57] there was somebody calling
[19:02] and he said this is for you

[19:17] here

[19:27] and you know

[25:36] and sister bless the word we are about
[25:39] to partake of as I pray in Jesus
[25:43] Christ's name thank you Lord
[25:45] amen as we read and
[25:51] Genesis
[25:56] let's start from chapter 18.
[26:03] 17 to 22.
[26:08] amen amen
[26:11] Genesis 18 17-22
[26:15] and the Lord said shall I hide from
[26:18] Abraham that thing which I do
[26:21] see that Abraham shall surely become a
[26:24] great and mighty nation and all the
[26:27] nations of the Earth shall be blessed in
[26:29] him
[26:30] for I know him that he will command his
[26:33] children and his household after him and
[26:36] they shall keep the way of the Lord to
[26:39] do justice and judgment that the Lord
[26:42] may bring upon Abraham that which he
[26:45] have spoken of him
[26:47] and the Lord said because the Cry of
[26:50] Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because
[26:53] their sin is very Grievous
[26:55] I will go down now and see whether they
[27:00] have done all together according to the
[27:02] Cry of Youth which is come unto me and
[27:06] if not I will know
[27:08] and the men tend their faces from things
[27:11] and went towards and Abraham stood yet
[27:15] before the Lord
[27:18] amen
[27:21] are you through
[27:22] okay
[27:24] then you may be seated
[27:27] you know
[27:30] [Music]
[27:35] I want
[27:37] take time
[27:42] because this morning I was just
[27:45] struggling with some other things
[27:51] because before I left my place
[27:56] for the service
[28:07] now we were
[28:10] going through yeah we saw the three and
[28:14] a half years of Christ's prophecies
[28:23] and now Jolly you know the prophet of
[28:26] God
[28:27] speaks now of the three and a half years
[28:31] of Lucifer Lucifer
[28:38] I mean
[28:40] the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ three
[28:44] and a half years
[28:45] of his prophecies
[28:49] then he says again
[28:52] then there is another three and a half
[28:54] years
[28:57] that is of Lucifer
[29:02] amen amen and then
[29:06] that three and a half years
[29:09] it's just about to start
[29:21] you know you know the Bible says
[29:25] Lord Lord
[29:27] looked at
[29:29] sodomless
[29:32] and he was pleased you know that
[29:35] scripture brother
[29:41] Genesis chapter 13. from verse 10.
[29:46] and Lord lifted up his eyes and beheld
[29:50] all the plane of Jordan that it was well
[29:52] watered everywhere before the Lord
[29:55] destroyed Sodom and come on even as the
[29:58] guardian of the Lord light the land of
[30:01] Egypt as Thou come as unto Thor amen
[30:06] he sucked but he was pleased to see
[30:09] Sodom and government
[30:11] it was well watered
[30:15] and then he was thinking of Agriculture
[30:20] and he loved it but the Bible says
[30:30] and even today
[30:32] really
[30:39] the world is destroyed the fastest
[30:44] amen amen so we we have arrived there
[30:50] are seals were opened
[30:53] so what else
[30:57] because this is
[31:00] the prophet of God says this is
[31:17] for the Bible says
[31:23] got up
[31:25] he got up and stood where it went to the
[31:31] place where he stood before the Lord
[31:34] [Music]
[31:37] you know that's why before we can
[31:39] continue
[31:41] we had to go back first
[31:45] to where we stood with the Lord
[31:50] amen amen because our ministry is
[31:53] timeless
[31:54] [Music]
[31:56] so you've got to go back
[31:58] in order to see
[32:06] for me to see
[32:09] in his condition
[32:11] I have to go back
[32:14] where I stood before the Lord
[32:18] amen because from there he could see
[32:24] amen right now we read it and when he
[32:30] looked
[32:31] he saw smoke
[32:41] it pleased Lord before it been
[32:49] feeling it was well watered
[32:51] amen amen just like today
[32:55] we hear predictions and predictions
[33:02] and yet I don't see that brightness
[33:07] I only see the coming of them
[33:13] and now I am going to share with you
[33:17] some few things
[33:21] the Lord willing
[33:24] all right amen
[33:26] and
[33:27] now we are blessed by the message
[33:34] if you reach let me read the in the
[33:37] Bible
[33:38] Genesis
[33:40] let me find this place
[33:47] it says
[33:49] first one and the Lord appeared unto him
[33:52] in the Flames of Mama
[33:57] and he said as in the tent Door In the
[34:02] Heat of the day
[34:06] and he lift up his eyes and looked and
[34:10] lo three men stood by him
[34:17] and when he saw them he went to meet
[34:21] them from the 10 door and about himself
[34:24] towards the ground
[34:30] and said
[34:32] my Lord
[34:34] if
[34:36] now
[34:38] I have found favor in this
[34:40] site pass not away I pray thee from thy
[34:45] sovereign
[34:58] [Music]
[35:03] a king of Salem
[35:07] amen amen
[35:09] because all the I mean the Seed of
[35:12] Abraham
[35:14] even today
[35:16] operates under
[35:19] the king of Salem
[35:23] because they are the citizens
[35:30] and when God met Abraham
[35:33] he spoke to him
[35:36] and Abraham started
[35:40] and Abraham and his seat
[35:44] not not his children
[35:52] now let's look at this
[35:57] he invited
[36:00] the Lord
[36:06] and you know how even brother Brennan
[36:10] mentioned
[36:11] mentioned this that Abraham said to him
[36:14] my Lord
[36:16] foreign
[36:47] he only knew the Lord
[36:52] okay amen now
[36:55] then he invited them for was it lunch or
[36:59] sort of yeah
[37:05] prepared them food
[37:08] Abraham knew that Abraham
[37:12] it is
[37:16] God is now a man here is
[37:32] sometimes we you serve God in your house
[37:35] and you don't know
[37:42] come on yes
[37:46] it is
[37:53] [Music]
[37:56] then he continues
[37:59] they beg for him
[38:03] and then he said the verse 10. I will
[38:07] certainly return
[38:10] and today according to the time of life
[38:17] shall have a son
[38:22] because the Bible says
[38:24] verse 11. Abraham and Sarah
[38:28] were old and well-stricken in age
[38:32] [Music]
[38:35] it cease to be with Sarah after the
[38:38] manner of churches
[38:41] foreign
[39:32] and then
[39:36] because they were three
[39:38] but Abraham
[39:41] recognized
[39:44] that's why he said
[39:50] amen amen and this means rules hence and
[39:54] look towards
[39:59] [Music]
[40:04] then is then the Lord said
[40:07] shall I hide from Abraham
[40:10] as Abraham was not supposed to go with
[40:13] this man
[40:16] because he was with God
[40:22] spoke to Abraham about everything that
[40:26] would take place there
[40:29] and he said
[40:32] and the Lord said shall I hide from
[40:36] Abraham
[40:38] that thing which I do
[40:41] seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[40:44] a great and mighty nation
[40:48] and then all the nations of the Earth
[40:50] shall be blessed in him
[41:00] not the children
[41:02] but they see the over Abraham
[41:06] the Bible says even the Lord Jesus
[41:09] Christ
[41:13] amen all right and then now jolly and
[41:19] I'm coming to this

[48:45] we spoke about Jehovah
[48:48] when Abraham needed
[48:53] God provided that realm

[50:09] foreign
[51:13] [Music]
[51:30] it speaks of itself
[51:34] now it's not something that you can
[51:36] teach us
[51:46] he says I've tried to explain
[51:50] and I made mistakes
[51:52] this will be the thing to my opinion
[51:57] this will be the thing that will start
[52:00] the rapturing
[52:04] perfect
[52:11] [Applause]
[52:14] it's not a teaching you don't receive

[52:23] by a third pool
[52:25] that speaks for itself
[52:31] all right you know one day we spoke
[52:34] about something here
[52:37] that speaks for itself
[52:41] when Adam forfeited the book
[52:47] and
[52:50] the last in the last days
[52:52] the prophet then came and said
[52:55] standing in the game
[52:58] because Adam
[53:00] a God and men were one
[53:05] when Adam left his posts
[53:13] please something else there we assessing
[53:16] family because God will never failure
[53:21] it is the place of man
[53:24] in partnership with God
[53:28] as the prophet of God
[53:31] man is the other part of the contract
[53:34] with God
[53:37] did you know that
[53:39] now standing in the game
[53:43] let me try again
[53:46] standing in which game is we are coming
[53:51] here to this third pool
[53:53] standing in which again
[54:00] yes
[54:03] or standing in which game which game
[54:07] men left his posts
[54:11] now he left air well
[54:17] again
[54:18] [Music]
[54:22] could not replace Adam with something
[54:25] else
[54:28] that's why he came as the second adult
[54:38] and you know in that book perfect faith
[54:46] let me reach
[54:49] I don't know whether you are going to
[54:51] accept this
[54:56] I let me ask you a question again
[55:01] we went to
[55:03] where
[55:05] brother Brandon received a swathi
[55:13] foreign foreign
[55:47] foreign

[56:07] [Applause]
[56:19] is there to put men back again
[56:25] yeah
[56:27] back today
[56:29] because that that belonged to men yeah
[56:36] the seventh angel message
[56:38] was given a swan with children
[56:45] then he said standing
[56:55] now for him to stand on the game
[56:58] he has to receive a sword
[57:04] and then for men and God
[57:07] to come together again
[57:09] amen amen
[57:12] God being the god of the universe
[57:15] and a man being the god of the earth
[57:20] what restoration means
[57:23] what Redemption means
[57:26] is to put it back again
[57:30] amen
[57:32] all right
[57:34] now
[57:37] standing in the game
[57:41] he received a sword
[57:44] to stand
[57:46] in that game
[57:48] which the Lord Jesus
[57:51] sprinkled with his blood
[57:54] and cleanse it because the greater law
[57:59] is the restoration
[58:02] because God can't be defeated
[58:05] he must restore
[58:08] everything
[58:10] that
[58:12] Satan
[58:14] tried to misplace
[58:17] that's right amen even you as a child a
[58:21] daughter of God
[58:24] if you are a daughter of God
[58:26] then you are because
[58:29] to be a daughter is through the blood

[1:00:10] what happens it speaks of itself
[1:00:14] I I try to explain to the others
[1:00:18] and I make mistakes this will be the
[1:00:22] thing that to my opinion we accept
[1:00:26] will be a thing that will start the
[1:00:30] rupturing phase
[1:00:37] now
[1:00:46] so don't you see
[1:00:50] Roman denomination did
[1:00:53] denomination mark
[1:01:11] that will force all Protestants
[1:01:16] you have to be into this Council of
[1:01:19] churches
[1:01:21] or you won't be able to have a
[1:01:24] fellowship
[1:01:29] well
[1:01:30] it's tightening
[1:01:33] we were looking at the other days
[1:01:40] some of them were arrested

[1:02:00] not allow his wife to go through that
[1:02:04] she will be raptured
[1:02:07] before this thing comes upon the people
[1:02:11] and then it says it's tightening
[1:02:16] every day
[1:02:19] people are being arrested for preaching
[1:02:24] now the Press comes to a place
[1:02:29] to where you are pressed out
[1:02:34] then watch I'm fixing to tell you

[1:05:27] I don't fear
[1:05:29] I don't feel Satan
[1:05:33] Satan is a defeated foreign
[1:05:44] the very same Force the power
[1:05:48] that fought him and
[1:05:52] was cast down to the end
[1:05:55] he is still going to face that Force
[1:06:01] it doesn't change
[1:06:03] the Satan that is trying to attack us

[1:06:29] he says it started Beyond time

[1:24:24] we fought with we fought
[1:24:27] he ran away
[1:24:31] yeah
[1:24:33] I'm not saying this for you to fear
[1:24:36] I'm saying we are more than conquerors
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:46] sometimes when we come to the service
[1:24:49] we are told that this and this is going
[1:24:52] to happen
[1:24:56] we just pray to God and come
[1:25:01] knowing that the god whom we worship
[1:25:06] has overcome
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:11] and he says
[1:25:21] there is
[1:25:23] some conquerors
[1:25:24] but it says
[1:25:30] [Applause]
[1:25:35] so that's why I'm trying to bring these
[1:25:38] things
[1:25:41] so that you'll understand
[1:25:45] sometimes when you see them calling us
[1:25:49] out
[1:25:52] you've been the bride of Christ
[1:25:57] the world hates you live
[1:26:01] because you are not of the world
[1:26:07] I mean even the Lord Jesus
[1:26:10] he said so
[1:26:13] because he was not afraid
[1:26:17] of the world is
[1:26:21] but I'm saying
[1:26:32] the doors
[1:26:36] [Music]
[1:26:41] what if God
[1:26:43] one day because
[1:26:49] he's going to close the door

[1:27:07] hear my voice
[1:27:11] he didn't say here my gospel
[1:27:15] hear my aqua
[1:27:18] because voice is a spiritual song
[1:27:22] and open the door

[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:28:01] sister came with some problems after
[1:28:04] problems
[1:28:10] Israel
[1:28:19] at one time they were on this side
[1:28:24] in Egypt
[1:28:27] now God had to deliver them
[1:28:35] he didn't send some prophets with
[1:28:37] miracles to Egypt
[1:28:44] he commanded Moses
[1:28:48] to cross over who reacted
[1:28:52] to lead them across
[1:28:57] that's why this message the ministry of
[1:29:01] the seventh angel Messengers
[1:29:04] is for us to cross over
[1:29:11] then I said to the assistant you've got
[1:29:14] so many problems it is because we are on
[1:29:18] this side of the problems
[1:29:22] now you must cross over
[1:29:24] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:29:27] Jesus Christ
