Thank you program director to give me this opportunity to on behalf of If we can look at the margin of the people who have come to support, we are really blessed. We cannot do a lot of work being alone. We can say we really appreciate your support. the family of we say thank you. You are doing the right thing because the Bible says to go to the family which is better than to go to the family. You are doing the right thing by saying comfort the person which you know him better. &gt;&gt; We are saying to the family what you have done to help one another. That is what you supposed to do as a family while you are still living. We we are saying to all of you &gt;&gt; this uh old lady which we are gathered here because of her. We are the eyewitness that she have been sick for long time. As a family, they didn't fold up their arms. They have done whatever they can in order to save the life of her mother. Our mother she have passed on while she was there in the hospital at hospital but we have done everything we can so that she can leave. You as a witness just believe that it is through our mother she have passed on. We don't want to hear a myth when you said we have seen our mother uh doing some woodwork or something uh on the bushes. You are a eyewitness that we have buried our mother. &gt;&gt; We can say to the children a departure of our mother. &gt;&gt; The family is still around. &gt;&gt; Make sure that we give them the news. Let's not just take rational decisions alone. Tomorrow those decisions will hurt us if we don't contact the family. &gt;&gt; The ta family, &gt;&gt; the family still around you. &gt;&gt; The grandchildren, they are still here. Come and visit as you used to do when you used to visit your all these families. Go to them and give a support. We know that the departure of our mother doesn't separate us as a family. It must unite us. When we are saying the elders from the church, we don't want to disturb them. When we leave here, we are going to the graveyard. This is a royal family. Normally the way we bury our people sometimes it might surprise you the way we do our traditional ours. If you feel free, just go there. But if you are not free, don't just go there. We have as family accepted that it is true our mother. She have she have left or she have passed on. I normally sing this song. Buddha recond. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thanks for the words of wisdom. Thomas is a representative from the family from Kavad. More Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Presenting Thomas Sag which is my older brother. Today he is not here. He had some commitment. I accepted that command from my brother. &gt;&gt; We are really deeply saddened by the departure of our elder mother. To me, she she was not like a granny. She was like my mother because I know a lot about the mother. From my youth up until today, I've learned from the eld mother. I really thank God because he left me while I know how to do things for my own. I saw my great mother for quite a long long time while she was sick. Even on her last days I was here. I'm I'm the one who took her to the hospital. &gt;&gt; I remember last of last week on Friday while I was talking to her through a phone. First thing she asked that did you come back? Uh she asked me a question and then I said to her did you come back and she said when are you going to come back? And then I answered that I will wait for the closure at work so that I can come back home. She asked that, "Can you fetch for me a pig and a goat?" &gt;&gt; Um, I really want to eat the meat of that while I'm seated with you at hospital. Things turn around after I hear about the call about my uncle uh the departure of our mother. We accepted that it is God's love. As for my for me, I really feel that it was a blessing from God to really heal is a truly healing of our mother. as a grandchildren. We will be united. We will always put our differences aside. As a people, we need to fight forward together as a grandchildren. I really thank you. Amen. Rainbow. Rich. I can I'm a singer. I do my isolation. and she may We might hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. of the children. Morning everybody. &gt;&gt; I'm deeply silent about the especially myself and &gt;&gt; because our mother, &gt;&gt; she is the one that raised us up. 1976. &gt;&gt; When we came to this land in 1976, &gt;&gt; she took all of us and bring us all of us here. &gt;&gt; We we we came here and we grow up with She taught us a lot of things like plowing. She also taught us about going to the root. She taught us a lot of things also including the love of people. I remember uh &gt;&gt; Okay. I remembered while I was uh being married. &gt;&gt; She was very upset. She asked me a question. Where are you going, my my daughter? And then I told I told her that I'm going to to be married. &gt;&gt; She said, "You cannot go there." &gt;&gt; I said, "Mother, can you allow me to go for to be married?" She said, "Listen to me. &gt;&gt; If somebody have hurt you, &gt;&gt; don't ever come back. Just tell me what hurt you so that I can give you some advice. &gt;&gt; You don't go there alone. &gt;&gt; I went there with damu. When we arrived there, there was they were really comforting us. All these children When they returned back home, I really bitterly cried. I remember the words of the of our mother that she didn't want us to go there. One thing which my mother have told me is that if a man comes back at night, You need to make sure that there's a warm water and then there's a food for your husband. After that, you go and sleep. If your husband looking for for the porridge, you must tell her that tell him that I have already cooked. It's just that is now cold. that your husband cannot come to my house and tell me that you didn't cook for him. &gt;&gt; My children's mother &gt;&gt; our mother have this agree &gt;&gt; I can spend a lot of time We didn't know by the name her by the name of &gt;&gt; we knew our mother by my mother the name English. She really likes those names English for my mother. She really and double let's just accept even if we have lost our mother let's agree that it is true she have taught us a lesson whatever she have taught us we really put into our I will sit back. Thanks very much. Right. One of the representative from the family. I greetings in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I say amen. I feel I I was supposed to speak as a representative of the family. The mother here, she is my aunt. Yes, she's my aunt. Yes. &gt;&gt; She was the one who would take care of me from grade one up until grade 12. &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm feeling very a pain in my heart. &gt;&gt; I grew well but the departure of our mother I feel like I've lost the Bible is true that when it says everyone is going to the grave Yes, she have been departed but we are remaining behind. Family of I really appreciate a lot for your support. We I just want to say we really feel sad by the departure of our mother. &gt;&gt; I wanted to take it another way of celebrating the life of our mother. But I really can't feel &gt;&gt; this is a very sad moment for the departure of our mother. When I arrived to the family, I really feels really wanted to even change my signing from. I really feel very saddened by the departure of our mother. I've grown up knowing my mother as mama uh as we used to call her with this few words I really say thank you I know my &gt;&gt; how are my Oh, I know my is more than a man. I would like to call and to move on. how I know I know Morning everybody. The way the way I was so touched I don't know whether I was supposed to write or whether I would put it the right way. It was supposed to be unclea on my place on his place, but he said my my young brother just stand up for me on my behalf. I'm just nephew. I'm just a nephew. We as a family of we accepted that have departed. She was really sick. You have the testimony. She was admitted at the hospital hospital. I went there to visit her after hearing that she's not well. What makes me happy? When I arrived hospital, she was smiling. I asked a mother and said, "Did you know me?" She said, "Yes, I saw you entering the hospital." We gave her support thinking that she's going to get help. But our God took her. We accept that God have done his love. What makes us happy is just that she left us accepted our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and she was living for God. It really comforted us as the Bible have indicated that whoever that believeth in the Lord Jesus Christ and being saved and being baptized, it really makes us happy because she was in the Lord. When she departed here, she will get eternal life. as a Christian family. Uh it it it tells us that uh we must not just cry without a hope. &gt;&gt; When she was called by the name English, it shows me that The family were very wise. I can imagine if she was educated what is going to happen. They were full of love which you cannot able to explain. He used to unite us. I know before I know her. When we visited family, it's been long for us staying there at the nephew of he was traditional Hey, when I was still young, I really I was staying with another family. Then the aunt told me that I must visit as a traditional healer. And then I really look for that traditional healer. And then they direct me that that is the place where you are supposed to get healing there. She used to to book for for us to book a line so that we can able to see that traditional healer because that place it used to get full with a lot of people who came to consult there at the traditional healer and then we end up sleeping there. So that we can get help tomorrow. She used to arrange for us and then we we normally take early taxi so that we can able to depart from family to go and visit. Yes.

May the Lord richly bless you all. May the Lord bless. May the Lord bless the family and the neighbors and all the elders and the people from the village. Even those that are coming from a far off, may the Lord richly bless you. I'm not a pastor. &gt;&gt; He is not a pastor. &gt;&gt; I'm just an elder in the church. &gt;&gt; A pastor means a shepherd. So just bear with me as I will be reading the scriptures. For those that are able to stand in respect of the word, I will ask you to stand as we read the book of First Thessalonians starting from verse 18 to verse 18 to say a word of prayer. Amen. Amen. We can pray. To pay a last respect to our mother. figure. Amen. Amen. Verse 18 says, "But I will not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not, even as others who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also who sleep in Jesus, will God bring?" For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them who shall asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to be the Lord in the air. So shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. Yes. Foreign Fore! Foreign! Foreign! Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm here just to comfort the feminine. You know, every time I read the word of God, I find a love story. You know, I always wondered why they called the Lord Jesus Christ the bridegroom. The reason I call it a love story, a man when he proposes a woman, he gives promises, I promise you that I will build you the best house. In another wedding, I remember the a wife a seedless. There's a lot of promises when a man proposes a woman. I'll make you the best woman on earth. I'll give you my name. You know all the promises. &gt;&gt; I had another one even promising the woman a train. &gt;&gt; A proposal goes with a lot of things inside. The Lord Jesus Christ when he came to the earth He brought a message to propose us. The Bible says, "The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout." So he descended all the way from heaven. And the Bible says with a shout. out was a proposal. It was a message going forth. So when he was giving out the message, there were so many promises. One of the promises, he says, if you believe my saying, verily, verily I say unto you, you shall not see death. What a proposal. &gt;&gt; Everybody was scared of death. &gt;&gt; But when he descended coming down, uh my brother, if you can just read, I just want to show you this love story. You know, uh John chapter 8 and verse 51. And and here when he was coming down a message out one of the promises &gt;&gt; that he brought &gt;&gt; in the proposal he shall not see death. &gt;&gt; Can you read it my brother? 8:51 verily verily I say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall not see death. You see where we read &gt;&gt; it says &gt;&gt; I will not have you to be ignorant. You know in in the language that we use here on the earth somebody depart the language that people understand it says the person is dead. But when the Lord Jesus Christ came, &gt;&gt; he says that is an error. When you read Matthew chap 22 verse 292 that is an error that's why he says I don't want you to be ignorant. When Lazarus was sick He said, "Our friend Lazarus sleep." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, the disciples didn't even understand. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; he if he sleep, &gt;&gt; if Adam he does work, &gt;&gt; he will wake up." So he had to talk to them in a language that they understand. &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, &gt;&gt; Lazarus is dead. &gt;&gt; The language they understand. So our mother believed the proposal that came when the Lord descended coming to the end. when he gave our mother a proposal to say, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you believe my saying, you shall not see death." Our mother said, "Amen." Accepting that proposal death if we have to define it. The Bible say death is total separation from God. So our mother is not separated from God. You see there are people that die that are separated from God. But the one that believe he's saying will not see death. Meaning he is not totally separated. You see a person is a triune being. You are a body which is this terrestrial being. When Job looked at it, say this one is full of troubles and it's of few days when the prophet Job looked at this body said ah this one is full of trouble. So you can't even brag about this. I heard one of the scientist saying this body is not even worth more than 10 cent. So it's not worth much. Then inside of this body is a spirit. &gt;&gt; You see when the Lord made a person He said &gt;&gt; when we read Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 it says and God formed man out of the dust of the earth. So this man is of the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; That's why we take him back to the grave. But then he says he breath into his nostrils breath of life as a man became a living soul. So you are a triune being you are a body, you are the spirit and you are a soul. &gt;&gt; Now when you depart The Bible says &gt;&gt; the spirit &gt;&gt; goes back to God, &gt;&gt; the body goes to the grave. But the soul when it departs, it depends what you believe. If you believe the word of God, it goes under the altar. It is in the presence of the Almighty Lord. If you didn't believe his saying, you are soul go to the prison house and the language that we use it goes to hell and it will be tormented in flames. But &gt;&gt; you see the Lord Jesus Christ said we &gt;&gt; because if you believe he's saying &gt;&gt; you shall not see death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said I am I want you to read that scripture. Matthew 22 verse start with 29 and go to verse 32. Matthew 22 verse 29. Jesus answered and said unto them, he do a not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God. &gt;&gt; Verse 32, &gt;&gt; 30 31 and 32. &gt;&gt; But touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. &gt;&gt; You see, let's go back to John chapter 8 &gt;&gt; because he says, God is not God of the dead. Death is total separation from God. So when they look at Abraham, &gt;&gt; Isaac, Isaac and Jacob, &gt;&gt; they are not dead. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why he says God is not God of the dead &gt;&gt; because they are in the presence of the almighty God. But those that are not in the presence of the almighty God, they are dead. So we must never go and see what they were saying starting from verse 51. &gt;&gt; I will read it my brother and you will interpret it. Chapter 8. Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. They challenged him. They challenged the Lord Jesus Christ. They said, "Now we know you have a devil." You see, when he was telling proposing and saying you shall not see death. They said this man has a death. &gt;&gt; They were not accepting the proposal. &gt;&gt; They said Abraham is dead. But before that he said unto the same people, God is not the God of the dead. He is the God of the viv. See, he said, "I am &gt;&gt; the God." Read that verse 32 again, my brother. &gt;&gt; Verse 32. &gt;&gt; I am the God of Abraham and the God of &gt;&gt; Just there is a present tense. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say I was &gt;&gt; I am &gt;&gt; because they passed away. &gt;&gt; It says I am. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. I am the God of Abraham &gt;&gt; and the God of Isaac &gt;&gt; and the God of Jacob. &gt;&gt; God is not God of the dead and the living. They challenge him. Now they say now we know you have a devil. The prophets are dead. How can you say if a man keep my saying he shall have a taste of death? They looked at him. He was a very young man. 33 years old. When they looked at him, art thou greater than our father Abraham? And they reminded him which is dead and the prophets &gt;&gt; are dead what makest thou? You know I'm sure they were even saying undermining him. You know somewhere they even say you are not even 50 years old and you say you have seen our father Abraham but I don't and he was giving them a proposal. Hallelujah. So even when let's go to the book of Genesis. You see when when the wife of Jacob passed away 35 verse 185 18 &gt;&gt; and it came to pass as her soul was ineparting now because they understand people won't understand the soul is in departing they say for she died just to make people understand but the Bible doesn't say if you believe the gospel of Jesus Christ you die you depart &gt;&gt; you know you go to it's like a promotion you go to the presence of the almighty god. You see here on the earth we are absent from the almighty god. So he comes and propose you so that when you depart you come into his presence. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to the book of Thessalonians. See that shout &gt;&gt; was the message going forth. &gt;&gt; In Matthew 25, &gt;&gt; they talk about the wise and the foolish visions. You see the message when it goes forth, it goes to the wise and it goes to the foolish. You see when when you sleep the wise and the foolish they slept. Now when the bridegroom came they woke up. &gt;&gt; That was the resurrection. Now when when the wise woke up because they had the spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead, they went with the bridegroom. But these others, they didn't go with the bridegroom. You see You need to have the spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead in you before you depart because it is the same spirit that will raise you up. Now let's go back to the book of Thessalonians. You see when he was proposing now the first promise that he gave said you shall never see death. That was the first promise. &gt;&gt; Now the second promise was the voice. Now that voice is the resurrection. You see the Bible says blessed are those that come in the first resurrection. says, "After you have departed, &gt;&gt; you are not dead, &gt;&gt; and I will raise you up." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to John chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, I won't be long. I'm just telling you about the proposal of the Lord Jesus Christ. The first thing he said, "You shall not see death. John chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Let's read verse 25. Let's start with verse 24. My brother, &gt;&gt; verily, verily I say unto you, he that heareth my word and believe on him that sent me have everlasting life. Can you finish it, my brother? &gt;&gt; And shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life. What a promise. &gt;&gt; You see the proposal, &gt;&gt; this proposal thing didn't start here. for a man to propose a woman. The Lord himself when he came HERE WHEN HE MET us he started with a proposal if you hear my way. You have everlasting life. What do you say? If you hear you have everlasting life if you believe You shall not come into condemnation, but you have passed from death to life. Even the scientists cannot promise you this. They talk about the shooting going up there. When you ask them about death, countenance fall about death. You go to a medical doctor for you to get healing to give you this injection. Ask them about death. The countenance for they can't promise you anything. One man promised us life. My brother &gt;&gt; 25 &gt;&gt; verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of God and they that shall live. You see that was the second promise. He says in his proposal you'll come in the first resurrection my voice then he says if you don't believe me &gt;&gt; come let's go I will show you where's Lazarus let me show you my second promise come forth &gt;&gt; and Lazarus came forth &gt;&gt; demonstrating the promise promise even if you depart. I will bring you up. You will be blessed &gt;&gt; because you will come in the second in the first resurrection. Then he didn't stop there with the promise. He went again and said and the trumpet of God shall sound. This is the most beautiful part. You propose a woman and the woman accept your proposal. Go home. You tell your parents. I'm ready to get married. You promised them a white wedding. That's what the Lord did. HE SAID IF YOU ACCEPT MY proposal you know after the resurrection we will meet again I'll take you to your palace marriage he he gave us a lot of promises because we have a short time I'm just bringing these three promises If you hear his word, you have everlasting life. You will not come into condemnation. If you depart, he will resurrect you. And he has already prepared a marriage supper. You see, not here in the palace. You see, I've had people reading John 14 verse 1 and 2. When he was leaving, he said, "For those that have heard my word, &gt;&gt; don't worry that I'm leaving. I'm going to prepare a place for you. I will come again and receive you unto myself and take you into the parish supper. and and and he he even went further and says, "I'm going to bring the Enoch. &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring the Jews, the 144,000 144,000 to take care of." Hallelujah. You know, and he said after the marriage supper, &gt;&gt; we are going for a honeymoon. &gt;&gt; I'm going to celebrate for 1,000 years in the millennia before I can take you to the new Jerusalem.
