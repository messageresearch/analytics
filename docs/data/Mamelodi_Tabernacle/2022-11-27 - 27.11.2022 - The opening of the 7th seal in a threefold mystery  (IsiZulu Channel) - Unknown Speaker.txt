foreign [Music] in this book 211 now look in what is anything that had a beginning has an image because God anything that had a beginning but God was not created he was always God why he says amen have you may take your system and I don't think you will dispute this um your soul was not created um so that your soul was processed um your soul was an attribute um which was not a creation but he created a body for that Soul um he became a living um all right now let's look at this they're not willing because standing now Manchester anything that has a beginning yes and in even spiritual amen okay now that's that's that's why in La cork we have shunned the things of the world [Music] because they begin somewhere end up somewhere it is the river Euphrates began somewhere um okay amen if our

know what is in our hearts [Music] we are firstly they said this part we went through it last time the only way you'll get the threefold revenation you only know him when you are in him and he is in you um that's right and this is the threefold Revelation is we were trying to put it last week there's two scriptures together no one no again [Music] we look at the other scriptures amen amen it's not a contradiction now munch but of that hour our day and hour knoweth no men no the angels of heaven no the Sun but after the church ages he is the son of man you see now the difference the world don't know is the Son of God to us now today when he came he came as this to as the son of men his people for him okay the body dies because they couldn't kill us just as good as they can kill yourself because your body is not yourself questions [Music] we empty the containers and in order to eat or to drink from their container all right look at this I will try to run the only way the only in the language you've seen it last week let us say the only way I guess there's no other way if you say I know him um like Paul says I know him and him crucified there's only one way to know him and the only way today you'll get the threefold revelations I'm trying to pick up something here original or a three-fold mystery or region how it looked like originally foreign originally are you I'm not saying you are quiet inside of you there is something going on Cod where are you what is CRT yeah okay have you ever opened the Cod book is do you read the Bible your Bible yeah okay pick it up on Sunday morning because you are coming to church this makes you a church goer local government just as your body needs food is we breakfast success and when they arrive here foreign [Music] you put him here to listen to the word um the belly this is all right now let's look at this now you know why some people yes it's because of a full belly yeah amen you can this thing yes you watch some people just just after shallowing the last day spoon of saza um foreign foreign [Music] who has some roots you can trace it back we have tried to read those things about what it was you can see what it is because we have seen it from what it was foreign [Music] [Music] the first man in the lower creations of God foreign then out of God came the logos which was the son of God then out are you listening out of this out of this nowhere else because like threefold Revelations of a man to normal you know that's why the Bible says Lord Jesus when the people would come and know would not know him no one can come to me my father who has sent to me amen amen amen no one can come you can't come to him foreign anas and where I am because you don't belong to the threefolds [Music] foreign foreign I'm going to John chapter 6 8 is it yeah eight you know I I'm that is it John chapter six Forty Four yeah yeah yeah you're right brother you're right now it says verse 44 80. we can rather go further okay you know you know you know you're not the scripture amen amen it should be John where he says I am the bread from from Heaven okay I want to pick it up where he started verse 35 foreign yes okay you know some of the letters here because of the yes and scratching and scratching spiritually palatable and start preaching that is first hey hey 44 you are right 44. hey verse 44. no man can come to me except the father who has sent me um you know their father I am meaning I am part of the three foods you are also part of the threefolds now you want you you want to know me unless the father who is the the headships foreign [Music] because we were in this three-fold Robert after him came forth out of the logos of the food the father because that's why Jesus comes and it says Jesus said to the disciples because if you are part of the threefolds [Applause] don't know a stranger easy Focus he says my sheep know my voice a stranger the Sheep is simple cannot be angry what am I going to say because there was only one voice because he said they know my voice because falling within there threefold because they are a part you know this body of mine is hey I'm so tired tomorrow I'm going I'm not going to the service the message is sent forth to the entire body um it's from their centering the whole body now all the organs in the body is so tired in the morning because of the message and the weight was that we are not going to use ability hey I I wonder you know this morning I wonder yes [Music] that's why the bride of Christ is the word of God um let me check this old Bible of my

business card to go foreign I met one of my old friends and brother I just gave it to him foreign amen you know we can close the service now it's somebody um out of the father came forth amen so it's all from when the father speaks the message [Music] then he said to them I said to Google go to all the words now a witness Instagram they told us at the Bible school that we should say in the name of fathers no that is not a Witnesses you must bring a message the Bible says there was a man sent from God foreign it is written in the prophets they shall all be taught of God being there lecture I was working with a brother in Google now there was a man like this drunk at the game this friend of mine let me greet him a father there again no I thought he was talking of his uh you know father then he

of the king of it not just as what I think and by Jay you know why why it is like this because his name is King King goes and goes amen now in his kinship causing back look around what happens he was attracted by a sword and it's he said to the prophet why I said to God Prophet fear not that is the sword of the king amen all right he dropped in his uh here comes the trouble the problems why beggar and later Revelation came concerning that's right it is a book in the hand a Sunday and the thought was given to Adam now he has failed wow the lamp in one the one sat on the throne a book in his writings and they said who is with him but this one won the battle and he has received the books very powerful and the real life they found out that back on anyone with it who has fought the battery life amen so that he said he is then after opening it comes because from the gardens yes now it was now to be handled by the king himself then when he gave it to the servants a man amen amen you know

Alabama [Applause] you know twinkle little you don't even expect to happen and what will happen even the enemy you should not see it it will sweep him it will hit him down your Swiss a pads twinkling of an eye the enemies waiting for the bride to go say when the tribulation comes um when the tribulation comes all the demons somewhere in the river yes there is some adult creatures suppressed by the power that is in the bright as an Amanda are they still there why they don't go but when the bride goes the Bible says my [Music] Brothers verse 10 to 12. so much God's given teaching from this what does it say eating and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the weight of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death therefore Rejoice he heavens and he that dwell in them who to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great rest because he knoweth that he has but a short time what about those in heaven rejoice the saints that were taken in the Rapture between and he said to them I said to Google but who unto God was there that are in the sea um he has come down to them knowing that as good his time is shot you know his plan yes he cannot overcome the last thing that he has in his mind in trying to hit back um that is just the last strategy he has now you see what is going on the money imagine trolls that are happening around amen amen everybody seems to be a sangoma look look what is happening around he is trying to take uh with him amen children can no longer expect our massage in the church Heavenly only few are going in amen because it's not promise these people were born to fight and win [Music] a man a man do you know that did you believe this particularly those who fought in heaven are still the same people I'm going to fight God has God known you and me let me say this if maybe I go overboard I've got everything to say stop listening I'm I'm going to this part again you know it says we are in the minority because the other part was taken by Satan we remain in Tennessee who is that the king who fought the minority against the enemy [Music] but the power is not in the minority Amanda foreign part of the army of God another part of it so that's why when that young man said the enemies [Music] amen amen right now don't look at Keenan Caleb and Joshua did not look at the number they looked at the word amen what did God say that was there foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] a man if she says [Applause] amen right I'm trying to finish you listen to them men of God I'm trying to leave this other part for next time I'm still going to read it again here I think today possessed with the spirit a part of this Angelic being spirits which rotated off of God yeah rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's life amen oh my goodness if you are a liar um [Music] [Applause] were subject to become humans foreign those Angelic beings which rotated off of God yeah [Music] then it will end up in heaven is if you have resisted the devil in heaven then that the resistance if you are taking that resistance with you back to heaven the battle in heaven was you'll come back to occupy those who have won the battle in here are now fighting their way back to Heaven [Music] amen amen now that's why you will see at that City when we amen then and the two-thirds of the Earth and more than two-thirds of the Angels were kicked out please that I don't believe in this Jesus not rotated them because you won't be there during the tribulation they will be wearing suits like this terrible amen okay but God can only run uh you know God didn't give us the stamina to outrun the devil yeah he gave it as the power Amanda [Music] to overcome look at the nature of the people [Applause] teaching preach and preaching what's wrong he was defeated in heaven because those who have won the battle and are going to win they started in heaven they've won the battle in heaven even right now amen amen amen today they will win amen even tomorrow um it doesn't start here with a long prayer those Spirits now that's why I'm trying to stop reading these others because it tells you that it tells you that we are in the minorities because part was taken by that's right let us finish with this again now we have look at the original sign ship okay three-fold again [Music] and then now I want for the last part of it even the sun don't know we have read it lasts there is no Eternal signship it is God himself who came

restored Mission and came by yeah we said amen we were there on top of the mountains was given that's right foreign I mean because even the angels they Minister unto us yes those corns because the
