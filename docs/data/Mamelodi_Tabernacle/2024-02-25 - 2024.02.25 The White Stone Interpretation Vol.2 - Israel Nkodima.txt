Description:
Title: The White Stone Interpretation vol.2
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on the 25 February 2024.

Text:  The white rock Confession 

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Revelation 2:17
Ephesians 4:30
The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the White stone interpretation.

The people who are going to the Lord have already registered.
The name in the Lambs book of life is not the same as your name registered in any other book. 

We were created by God , hence we can’t worship anyone else, we can’t even worship ancestors.

The dead were kept in paradise, but when the Lord died he went there and it was then changed to be the 6th dimension.
When a person takes a car or life insurance it indicate that those things are of a short term. 

The Lord says if you believe in him, you shall never see death and not taste it also. 

The first paradise was of the blood of the goat, the second one is of the 6th Dimension. 
We go to Christ because he has risen. Paradise was before the death of the Lord, and after his death when he rose up , paradise  was no longer there it was then the 6th dimension. 
 You can’t talk to dead people, it is only a demon that will be talking to you.
Christianity is not religion, religion is when you talk about God, with Christianity you have to go back to the mind of God. 
When God made the garden of Eden, he had already had Adam to occupy the garden. 
In Christ you are not a visitor but you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world. That is why we can quit the things of the world to find the creator.

The Pastor quoted the following spoken words:
62-1104M - Blasphemous Names Par 130

some Brothers which I don't know whether it sounds well with them I have heard not once saying that the Rapture will take place this year amen amen then after that one of the people I was talking to and I heard him talking about so the Lord willing maybe after so so years get married and I repeated that I hear saying that the Rapture can take this yeah but the Lord the word says let him find you doing if you are PL he will find you amen amen he didn't say quit he say now we are going to read the word let us just up for we we won't take time and uh because we are talking to the people amen the people that God has already spoken to them amen amen let's bow our heads we are going to read the same word that we had last we Heavenly Father amen once again yes this is one of the days amen we are looking we are really not counting the days but we are only we know that we are living in the time when the Lord everywhere I go yes people if you open up there things like YouTube and things really in state of watching the people portraying themselves you find that the talk they are talking about the coming of the Lord I believe there are some people here who are already in sometimes even yesterday I was just saying I'm so glad to preach to the people whom I see as even my future family the people will be with me actually it's not future for these people were there in the mind of God before before the foundation of the world that's why he said you are sealed before the foundation of the world so I'm glad that I I'm amongst the people who shall never taste of death amen death is not for your children but it is for the body the body carrying us will surely die but ourselves we have another body waiting Yonder the souls already have picked up the type of the body that when we leave this body we shall enter into that body where we will know the P we will see the universe Hall not as we see it from where we are now because all things there our eyes will be able to see and we will recognize these things that were formed before the foundation of the world there's some people among us some are sick but you left Heaven came down when you saw you saw the condition that we were found to be in shed your own blood you were without sin amen The God Who translated himself yes sir Chang himself into a man like me to come and fellowship with me on Earth and he told me that by his stripes I was healed if you are sick this morning by his stripes you were healed accept him and say I believe you people can believe one another but what more if people could believe in the God who created them you are so wonderful Hallelujah even this morning as I pray in Jesus Christ's name bless the souls amen bless the word amen we are about to partake of as I pray it's a wonderful day Amen in Jesus Christ name [Applause] amen h brother read for us amen God bless you Sister read us the same scripture Revelation chapter 2 verse 17 he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit sayth unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to it of the Hidden man and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth e amen amen amen you may be seated uh for this few minutes it says brother uh let me he it says he he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit sayith unto the churches you know it says he that has not not ears because SE in God you've got only one amen amen one year one hearing faculty I don't have you don't have two years for the word of God In God we have only one year one message that is in God In God we don't have messages we have a message he has become our message that's why the Bible says he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches all right amen so then we I will give him a White Rock White Stone uh the color white is the original color understand white white that's why we sing white than the snower than the snow and uh now I will finish up what the part that we brought to you last week for few minutes then we will close not the service but the time here to continue the time of a son or daughter is not a limited time for the Bible says you have time etal a a person who has eternal life etern uh I believe we only understand what the word Eternal means because God is eternal amen that's why when God speaks like he spoke Ephesians 4: you listen God sometimes we we say let's meet for a topic then as human we talk about things but next time we change something else next time we change to something but you listen when God speaks he speaks another language let's he the language it says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption amen right you know when is the day of redemption that is the day the book is open amen because those whom he has preached destinated for Redemption their names were written in the book of the Lamb amen amen God also has an office everything in God is registered those that are going to heaven [Music] already are in the [Music] book registered already amen amen and the Lord said by their works you'll see them amen amen now the book says grief not the Holy Spirit continue grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption right amen unto the day of redemption now the I look for that day which day is the day of redemption and it says it is the day the book of redemption is open amen amen amen and uh you see your name now the name in the Lamb's Book of Life is not that like the name registered uh in a at a certain School office or workpl no the book in the in the L book The L's book of life amen amen amen uh you hear sometimes they speak about life insurance insurance insurance life insurance but it this life only we give you that name life the real life is God amen amen amen that is life now we were born birth is when you are being introduced amen amen when a woman is expectant no one knows who is coming but we see that somebody is coming only God knows who is coming because babies are molded in heaven in God he is the one the author of life that's why I can't worship be created by by demon or created by an created by God Amen how can I worship something else unless I turn to the one who created me amen every morning I say this is another morning I'm still alive here because God has kept my soul that I should live amen amen so I can worship what they call what is called ancest it's happened like this when the Lord his body died because When They Crucified the Lord Jesus Christ Bible says his soul went well amen amen it went well yes am his duty because down there were some Souls now he had to go to [Music] separate Souls from Souls there was a place where it was called paradise and the dead in Christ were kept in a place but when the Lord died it changed from Paradise di they were brought closer next to the seven Di amen amen now that's why he says the dead in Christ shall rise [Music] first amen amen when you are dead and they say you are dead you died in the Lord your body it is your body that di for it says if you believe in him you shall never see death now if it says you shall never see death is not talking to the body the body because it's all flesh shall see death because it was born but you it's you and your body now your operation depends it CHS in which type of body are you operating if it is the body of flesh but who is in that body because if it is a child of God an eternal spirit in this body then you'll hear the language that the person in this body is not worth if he is from God for the Bible speaks of redemption now you know what is to redeem is to take something back to orig amen amen if you can follow the Book of Job he will tell you amen okay amen now because we just for a few minutes no the white stone there is one part in my book here it is called Blasphemous names Blasphemous names and this Blasphemous names this part in it page 18 where it says um it speaks of the confession here because you know all of us we will stand before him whether you are a [Music] king will stand before you the Creator not by Dem not an I was trying to tell you to say something when the Lord died he sold went down down down down because they killed the body but they couldn't kill him amen because he is not that b amen when they kill the body Peter says his soul went down we have read about that when he was down there you know as Christian you you you've got that record of Jesus being born and you know you know when he was born it was Gabriel that came and said to Mary H blessed blessed among women she was chosen for a special Ministry of Joseph was set aside for God to bring his seat through and said Joseph Joseph although he didn't understand but he was set aside for Gabriel now Gabriel came in and said to Mary blessed are thou then when she he spoke to Mary Mar first didn't understand for he said I know not men I'm a vision and uh the angel said what you shall conceive is of the Holy [Music] Ghost it has nothing to do with men it's not the seed ofen amen then when Mary believed amen and took the word of God in Mary that word became blood then when the angel left a a body started in for Jesus Christ didn't come to the body that came through [Music] Joseph he was the Christ that's why even before he was born [Music] prophecies there was this woman suing around saying I know mesiah [Music] coming before even Mary was noticed to be pregnant there was there were those who came with a prophecy I know mesiah and when he has come we will know all things you know right now we were told that when you die it is this body that but beyond this body you know in this body we need a to exploit now but in this body we don't see things we don't see far away we ended up with [Music] glasses our sight is getting dim all the time but don't worry it is in this body but in that body you you see like in your your thought amen meaning this when you are here each and every one of you know where his house is and I will say to you uh if for my first time I want to visit you you must give me your what location send me location amen amen now God has already sent us the location amen that's why your preparation is not of what you are expecting in this world expectations of in this world are in this way when you buy a car why you you've got to take it for insurance take it in for insurance because you are expecting it for a short [Music] time amen even they tell you that uh before you start off with this car you must count them Insurance amen amen already they are expecting destruction all right amen why has not given us an insurance amen he has given us an eternal life there's no accident and he said to you if you believe you shall never see death amen amen amen insurance insurance indicates to you that your life is short the life of this car of mine short anything can happen any time amen amen amen as I told you that a brother took me to the under not uper when they when he was looking at me I'm preaching the gospel but he looks at at my body and they say you are going down you I mean to my body that's why he took me to an yeah when we arrived where was it is somewhere close to M when we arrive say lady took me around took us around because the brother introduced me as a pastor now the sa lady Pastor then he said let me show you nice one for the p a gasket Cas amen amen first he took us around showing this is this but when the brother said introduce me as a pastor all right then let me take you to meaning the special one for the past yes sorry already she had one for me while you are living maybe breaking maybe you are a rich or poor no matter what the Undertaker has already taken there going you come driving 3 million he's got the box for you that's the life here if we knew about it you would accept the Lord Jesus Christ because he didn't introdu to you a gasket but introduced to you etal that he says if you believe in me you shall never see death death means separation you are rich you are poor you are king you are but the gasket is there for you that's why those who know about it if you say sing a song If you say to [Music] himing amen we are in this world continue [Music] amen amen just listen who can such Amazing Grace we would love to be there where Jesus is all right amen now before we close uh I was trying to say where is this what you call came from ancestors where is it coming from when Jesus died the Bible says Peter says he went his soul went down that's what he came from came for to redeem the Bible says he tasted death for us he overcame death in order for us also to overcome death our body will die but ourselves shall never die if you believe in him you shall never see death am it is your body that will die now the Bible tells us that he went down then the day he resurrected what happened some resurrected didn't the Bible say amen amen amen and they were taken with him because the first Paradise was of the blood of goats amen amen and but the second one which now we say the sixth Dimension he brought them to a place the Bible says when he rose again Graves were open amen Graves were open then the dead came [Applause] out those were of the first [Music] resurrection and together with him when he was taken up you only know of him being taken up but that cloud that covered was The Souls of those who came out of the Grave amen amen that's why the Bible says he will come in the clouds it's not talking about that are with him but the souls that are with him they appear like CL [Applause] amen amen amen and they shall be taken they were when he came out and he woke again after his resurrection he was around for how long am 40 days amen amen the one who died was around and there were Souls when on his resurrection the people of the first resurrection the Bible says they came out of the Grave am because each soul recognized its body am because when they died the soul went to God the body to the grave but the day of Resurrection that is when the soul recognized body and it comes the resurrection is when the soul comes into the body amen then is a resur resurrection amen all right amen and what happened after that uh you go to a medium because he he took his to the the six Dimension now if you die h i mean if you go to if they say oh no go and check with the elders the the one that's sleeping things are not going well here at home we must go and check with the sleeping with the ones that are sleeping now you don't even know that the one who died his things were okay or not that's why that's why we go to Christ because he rose again amen amen I canot go and consult to a person that I don't know then what happens a medium you go there now I want to inquire from the things are not going well at home now the children are not getting Mar now monies they are going this side and this side what happens I was looking at one he will say uh bring me your mother's Shaw or your father's jacket something of the disease then he puts it on and get into a trans amen amen then after that say is your father is crying or your grandfather is crying now after the resurrection of those Saints they are no longer where they used to be where that woman call samel samel is no longer because the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ they were taken di amen that's why when the prophet was taken there while alive you know Peter Paul went to the third heaven because he was a forerunner Forerunner go first and come and say the city is there that's a forerunner josua they went F came and say it is there let's take it amen amen you must but after now the death of Christ those who died now were no longer there they were the righteous taken to the sixth God being in the amen amen amen that's why if you are in the sixth Dimension Di I want to see Christ they tell you that he is just beyond here amen I write to you something that he says the fourth dimension the fourth you will see things you know the fourth that's where we see you amen am H maybe speak speak pastor know the fourth di people they are in the fourth dimension that's where you can show yourself the world showing that you are skillful on this you can cook better so you appear there while one is appearing there to show that I can cook eating at hotel amen amen nice food and one is displaying somewhere that I can cook and so forth she knows or he knows that there are people out there who can cook better than I don't know what for fame this one has to appear in the fourth dimension to show that I can you see how people would love to be introduced but I want to be introduced to Christ because he knows me better than any other person my Creator amen you go somewhere else they they they dress you up yeah when you come out of that place Beauty cont have you been to a beauty contest have you been have you been all right but I don't I've never seen one like that one of Christ hey that that new heaven new you've never seen anything like this that's why I have shown all these other things in order to see that one Abraham AB there were cities and cities but the Bible says Abraham looked for amen amen amen until he met the king of because in abrah there was something that connected him the king of that City to come amen then Abraham H I can't say he was desperate he knew that there's a city but let's go let's come back here first when the Lord rose from the dead my time is up now you know what happened he took those who were in Paradise that's why you don't hear of any Paradise after that because they were waiting for the for the day but when after they shed his blood they Rose the Bible say you read your Bible when he rose from the death also first resurrection they they called them the the dead of the first resurrection amen okay amen that's why we told you time and again when Lazarus died then the people started there and even Lazarus sisters but when Jesus arrived he was the resurrection now he couldn't attend a funeral today we attend funeral yes I even was very thankful to see my brothers and my sisters at the funeral of our brother Timothy with our brother leading songs don't you think that I'm ignorant I was there I was amen amen and we are so glad to see that at least we are also there attend the funeral of our brother amen amen so I was glad when I saw our brother leading even tomorrow let's do likewise amen amen [Applause] amen the Bible says Rejoice with those that are happy and sympathize with those that are now but I'm I'm saying now if you are AER let me show you something when Christ died the Bible says one day we will open the Bible the Dead R those who were in Paradise amen now uh they were under uh because before Christ died it was the blood of the G but when he died was all the other sacrifices done away with and there remain one sacrifice the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world no more a goat not the blood of goat amen amen now he emptied [Music] there the graves were empty what manner of man is this then after that Graves were empty now if you go to medium in medium goes into a trans and and say yeah and I your your father then he start to speak and you hear as as he speaks H you hear like as it's your father your late father you even will have some dreams and so I'll tell you things next time now that is not your father your father is dead your mother is dead like my mother is late my mother I don't expect to see her no and the Bible says now what what seekest thou the dead among the living the living among the dead yes amen the thing is if you go like to a media like that woman it is soul that said find mewhere somewhere she did that because H the Lord had not yet to take those to the six when they were still there a medium could go down in the spirit world and talk to somewhere but after the resurrection of Christ couldn't amen now what happens if you go there trying to call your father your mother Satan will save you it is a demon if my father is not a Christian when he died he died a sinner now if I go there and want to consult only a demon will represent then I will say even in my dreams I've seen my father he spoke to me and then he even said you must a white [Applause] not your father not your they are asleep you can't talk to them the Bible says why seeketh you the living the living brother the Bible say so why seek among the dead but it's a demon that will introdu and you say I I want to talk to my mama demon comes how can I help amen amen now at home we can't sleep we don't have this we don't have amen amen then say all right then say okay now get a white goat yellow and Yow chicken my friend it's a [Music] demon and it is ancestor it was you were supposed to say that the demons that interferes in people's lives that's why we have this money rituals people are now without Souls they sold their souls just for money where are you going with money I'm Los money you will end up killing because the Bible says the love of money challeng is the root the root of what the Love of Money a mother a man can kill his child just for money I as somebody if you are a billionaire when you die where does that money go do you go with that no but you become so Troublesome when you are still working and talking mhm then that's why the Bible says the love of this is a funny even if you can say to a person brother the Bible says the love is the root of all amen he can say Amen later on you say please as you see me is blinded by this love until you know my prophet that we we we even learned when we go to the places parking laws uh you expect a small boy to come and say can I wash your car because you are thinking of he's looking for money then and after you say now when you go there now he hits your car looking for amen I found one young busy piercing one tell the truth before I was looking at that Bo look at this young Bo of the he said can I watch your said you get what I mean the love of M you know root don't tell yourself you've killed a tree when the roots are still there if the root is still there the tree still much alive you haven't killed him now it says the love of money is the root of not two evils men can kill you for [Music] money when when a person is without God it's like that that's why Jesus Christ would say for him to finish the he say he's like your you like your father the devil did you hear him amen amen amen now he he really wanted to settle the matter because this people also they calling themselves now when they argu then he said you are of your father that's why he was always chased around by Stones God on being a man becoming a man being chased around by Stones all right amen Amen in closing now we thank the Lord today we can see the difference do you see they say there ancestors you are talking about the demons Amen in 10 in state of speaking to God you try to visit the dead and you can't talk to to your dead Mama a demon and say can I help you yes Mama and so and you'll be misled now God be with you uh we are still we haven't yet touch the white stone we'll come to the White Stone I I don't know because sometimes to join a highway you've got to go gravel road but actually you are to the highway because when you join the highway I now you put it on

white stone will come there we only typed it that even about that man and uh what do you call that man the architect architect yeah do I pronounce it well yes what is it the architect architect when he was supposed to build a bridge yeah it is there that bridge is there some have seen them it says some who came the other Architects they couldn't start that bridge because to cross at a certain place at the Sea of the sea now they had to go down because you've got to go to the root of things that's why with God he goes to his mind back now he he will call things from before the foundation of the world chrity it's a deep thing because Christianity is not religion religion is a talk about God that is not Christi something different Christianity you've got to go back to the mind of God and that's why that scripture says what did that scripture say you were chosen chosen when in him before the foundation chosen before the foundation before there was Foundation you were already chosen when God made a g ofen already had for occupation so you were chosen before the foundation of the world is that right amen you are not a visitor am yeah I can be a visitor here maybe it's my first
