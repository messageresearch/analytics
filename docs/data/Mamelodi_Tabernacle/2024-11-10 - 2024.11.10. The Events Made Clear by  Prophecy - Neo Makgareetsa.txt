Description:
Title: The Events Made Clear by Prophecy
Preached by Elder Neo Makgareetsa on 10 November 2024 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

Daniel 2: 1-5 | Daniel 2: 31-35 & 37-45 | 

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the events that are made clear by prophecy.

King Nebuchadnezar dreamed a dream but forgot the dream and he called all the wise men, Chaldeans that they should tell the king the dream and the interpretation.

The astrologers, wise men and Chaldeans asked the king to tell the dream so they can interpret the dream for him. But the king repeated that he has forgotten the dream, and he wants them to tell him the dream and its interpretation, but they fail to do so. 

In life we need to consult in order to go forward, it just depends where we consult from. 

When the squeeze is upon the people that is when you see their true colours.

The presence of God became the presence of the men. Everything you do, everywhere it is God doing that in you. Everywhere you go the entire heaven is backing you up and the people will confirm that to you.

God is the solution for everything. When the people hate you, it means that your presence makes their things not to work.

We should not be man pleasers, but we should stay with the course of what we believe. As the world hated Jesus, hated brother Branham and your pastor they will also hate you.

The elder also quoted the seven visions of the prophet and how accurate they were manifested.

The elder read the following quotations:

2 verse 1 to 5 and in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams where withth his Spirit was was troubled and his sleep break from him then the king commanded to call The Magicians and the astrologers and the SE the sorcerers and the childin for to show the king his dreams so they came and stood before the king and the King said unto them I have dreamed a dream and my spirit was troubled to know the dream then spake the children to the king in Sak oh King live forever tell thy servants the dream and we will show the interpretation the king answered and said to the children the thing is gone from me if you will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof he shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a down hill amen amen if there's one b can we read it as well I want to check something if it's [Music] corresponding for amen May be seated yeah I wanted to hear something fromy Bible amen so this morning I'm going to be on time uh while waiting for the rapture we will come to the church and D together so my title this morning will be about the events made clear by prophecy because we realize that we live in a prophetic world so the prophecies were always there their Visions were always there their dreams were always there as just read here where the Bible says nebz had a dream and he forgot that dream so he made it clear to the people that I had a dream that was troubling me but I forgot it so when he called these people the magician the astrologers as Sans he explained to them thoroughly that I had a dream but I for helped me out because uh you have been enjoying the benefit of being next to the king doing nothing now you must work have you ever come to that situation at work you employer saying I've been paying you for many years but now you must work now same thing here he told them they must work now now when they come to him they said to him well we have heard you but give us the dream we will give you the interpretation the look at them taking me for gred I repeat it many times I forgot the dream you must tell me the dream I forgot and after telling me the dream you tell me the interpretation it was difficult they usually say even their knes couldn't cut anything they didn't have [Music] direction must work over time they must go and call their gods and get everything together to make a presentation before the king and then they went back to the King again they said King give us the dream we we will give you the interpretation read the whole chapter as it goes down was a communication between them and the K and the King said now I'm no longer going to talk with you I must just write a letter the king wrote a letter and said call all those people the wise men in Babylon the magician the [Music] astrologer men and the children the king said call all of them and kill each and everyone that was the instruction from King he said so now they knew they're going to die and then they were directionless but they knew that there's a God in Israel they came together and said guys here we are going to die we don't want to die let's just swallow our pride there's a man who can help us preserve our life and then they went to that man by the name of Daniel Daniel saw them coming and they communicate with him amen you know I always say we can all be the children of God but our characters are not the same but we are the child of God we work for the kingdom Daniel was a kind man when when they throw him into the lion's there he was he was just singing must Jesus be the cross he was there and then God preserve his life now when these people from Babylon come to and then he sat down with them then they were explaining their story being kind and soft kind of a character he looked at them he listened to them and he responded to them the king is cruel when I'm looking at you I just see copses and he's going to know that wasel in a soft way help us we know that our our tricks help all help us here you Daniel you are the only solution of our life Daniel was just a smiley brother then he said brother as I am you can see I'm just like you but I'll try man let me ask my God because your God has failed and then Daniel went to see the king he said King as you have consulted with the sorer the magician the [Music] astrologers let me as well consult then I will come back to you in life we live in a life of consultation don't lie to me that's how we live you cannot go forth without consulting but it depends to whom you concern you cannot be a loner you will be lying to us there's somewhere somehow where you will need help like it or not so Daniel said to him when you consult to those let me consult to this then I'll come back to you the king said go and come back those wise people of Babylon they were really thinking should but you know how was built you cannot run away there were Chariot on the you know on the walls there were security all over the place and the King told them that no one goes out no one comes in just make sure everything is in place these people have been long paying them they must work today just you know because we read we have that mentality of reading we were not there it becomes an easy thing it was not in imagine this morning the soldiers surround this Tabernacle but today you are not going out until we get 1 2 3 otherwise we kill all of you that's when you'll know who are the real Christians because because one will go to the soldiers say actually me I wasn't actually fellowshipping here even my wife for me to marry her she's the one who told me about the message but I'm just saying just excuse me when when the squeeze come will know the color of the people let the youth they will say is the parents while actually we not believe in this is an exit exit strategy when you face death you become real you now Daniel was a smiley brother then he said to Nebuchadnezzar I come back to you he said to the witches and the magician I'll come back to you but up and then he go he said Lord God here is the situ sitation for us to be known to Babylon is when you can come down and show these people that there's a God in Israel that was Daniel and then God said as you said as as you said as my son is my obligation to come down and answer hallelujah amen you know it was not an easy moment God answered Daniel after answering Daniel took him back to the king and the King get the answer amen amen let's read the very same chapter 2 we will read from verse 31 chapter 2 from vers until 35 35 we'll go on thou oh King sawest and behold a great image this great great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and that and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smed the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to Pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the C the cuff of the summer threshing flaws and the the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that SM the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth amen amen amen that was the dream and it ends there and then Daniel gave it to the king the sarus The Magicians the Chans and all of them they were listening as Daniel you know give the king the dream so in fact the king saw from his kingdom being the king of babyon until to the end of the world when he was looking at this you know dream it troubled him and he did not understand amen amen when he was talking to these people it was there was a moment where they were answering the king saying to him no one in this world who can give you the answer of your dream and what you dreamed about they were saying that to him the only person that can give you the answer is God who does not live in this world amen amen so last last week last Sunday I was in I was telling the children of God my message was about the presence of God the present B became the present of men what was in God was in a man amen amen yesterday I was in a funeral one of my sisters departed and then they asked me to speak many speakers came the friends the preaching and everything you and then right just at the closure they just say as the angle of the kids just say some few words so I said few words but let me just tell you what happened it was you know in a funeral especially people that do not believe they just go to the funeral and lean on their C strink and smoke and make noise was crying it was that kind of a situation but to my surprise when they say I must talk when I take the platform it was silent everybody was quiet and listen after that we just go home to have some food and go I drve back to wbank so when I'm in the C I have my colleague here leanda and my wife we were driving together and my elder brother so I was sleeping in the car when I was sleeping in the car then I woke up then Myer brother said I was tired you know you are my little brother I was just talking to you and every every time like a little brother but I want to confess this morning there is something in you that is so special Even in our family we do not have how come it was noisy confusion lot of things that were not going right but when we talk everything come to a then I said to him I don't know amen amen now it reminded me when I was saying the presence of God became the present of me I want to tell the church this morning your present is the present of God wherever you go whatever you are doing is God doing it that is why the witches the sorcerers the child they could know where is the solution of their life they realized that the Pres of God is with Daniel they went to Daniel and Daniel rescued them wherever you are going the whole interage of Heaven all the Angels they with you don't doubt don't doubt yourself God is piing you up yes we are human beings full of mistakes but the whole Heaven is piing you up and the people will tell you the witches here the the wise people here the S here they told Daniel we know you have the solution of this problem they even said to Daniel imagine Daniel we are dead our wives our kids our relative the king said he will kill them how are you going to feel Daniel are you still going to go to heaven not helping us seeing us been killed a smiley Daniel just say I will see what I can do but my God will answer and we see God answering Daniel and he gave him the dream and he said King the dream that bothered you is this then NE said yes and now see this is what I dream this has troubled me I do not understand then he went back to the sorcerers the Charan the the the witches I say here is the dream give me the explanation they couldn't explain the answer of what is happening before now and later go it's go if you have God you have the answer for every solution then the King was looking at them you said to me you want the dream you'll give me the explanation or the interpretation now Daniel has given me the dream interpret it for me they couldn't understand because it was a prophetic dream you know in life we are not the same we are not in the same level even us as human being our intelligences are not the same even the cars are not the same as I was saying the other day this friend of mine was driving Uno fire no no was Master then he said to me then I smile yes because they were driving 80 km when you drive 140 you do like this why you could of ml if he can say now let me go you are the will come out because the power and your power are not the same even in the church we are not the same you like it or not we are children of God we are not the same we cannot be the same you go to heaven the angels are not the same they will never be the same when there is war Gabriel can try he will not win until M com they are not equal don't think we are equal there are certain problems you yourself and your friends and your relatives they cannot solve they cannot solve until you go to your pastor and say Pastor I tried this I tried that but this one need you the pastor is not going even to pray he will just say thank you for letting me go home your problem is solv hey even if you can fast 40 days and 40 nights that problem will not leave you until you see your now the king said to them here is the dream I like Daniel he was just there holding arms looking looking down you know he was a shy person looking down with yeah what can I say yeah which is now he turn to speak L yeah yeah so at the end Daniel said no King because they failed God give me the interpretation here is the interpretation we can read verse 37 verse 37 to 44 to 44 amen thou oh King are a king of kings for the god of Heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory and where soever the children of men dwell the Beast of the field and the fs of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made the ruler over them all thou art this head of gold and after there shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third Kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breth in peace and subdueth all things and as iron that breth all this shall it break in pieces and Bruce and whereas thou seest the feet and Toes part of Potter's clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou soest the iron mixed with Merit L and as the toes of the feet were part of the iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and where as thou soers iron mixed with mirl they shall mingle themselves with the seed of me but they shall not c one to another even as iron is not mixed with CLE and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to another people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever can you read 45 45 for as much as thou sawest the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great God ha made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is set and the interpretation thereof sure he was troubled by this he saw the beginning and the end of the world but it was not meant for him know but he needs a man of God to explain to him you know Jesus was teaching in Parables and leave the people to go but to the disciples he will give them interpretation amen amen soar when he died he died knowing that his kingdom is above all the kingdom the one will follow the other one and the other one and the last one but the last one will be the kingdom that will stay forever and ever he saw the city to come amen amen then Daniel give the interpretation then he kept quiet and then the king look at the witches the magician the and then he said to mustel I could have just cut off your heads yes and then they were happy because he he was just a king in Babylon he he thanked God by erecting the stage of Daniel then Daniel said no this is not what I wanted God said this is not I wanted what I wanted amen amen you thank God in the wrong way we don't need images in the Bible God said to the children of God when you fight and Conquer burn the images the pictures B the idols but here he raised an idol just like Daniel amen amen because they believed in this this States they're not innocent you can see a stage standing there for many years I you look at that stage during the can I tell you something that stage at night is active they not innocent they are not innocent they are innocent during the day at night they're active you see innocent people during the day T night they [Applause] fly yeah there was a moment in Philistine where their idolon was in the house they bring the Ark of God in the very same house when you open during the day they innocent is there innocent a fish God the AR is there innocent close the door lock the door come tomorrow you will tell [Applause] me they started to talk and said to the who do you think you are that's why you are here then the AR will respond I behind this I will even show you this this night that I am God in fact I allowed your people to bring me here so that I can deal with [Applause] you God is God of perfect will and the permiss and will say to the let me just finish you off then the people come in the morning is there in here then they [Music] raise the AR Inta then they they look at this and then later they lock the security is there come tomorrow morning the was in pieces when they look at the ark intact something are happening at night when you are sleeping amen amen and then they started to realize we brought the wrong thing here then they remove him when they take him to somewhere let's say h the people of RA just seek all of them they say remove this thing when they take him maybe to the people got sick they remove him until they take him back to Israel [Applause] don't be surprised when you are among the people they dislike you they don't want you among them is because when you are there you are present make their things not to work they cannot hate Jesus and love you they cannot hate brother BR and love you if they hate your pastor you you are with them amen you must stick to what you believe irrespective of who said now here's Daniel giving them the interpretation the king said you know what the company car that I used to give you that grocery allowance that petrol cut that salary I used to give you they must all go to Daniel are doing nothing was not nice but it worth it because when God comes down you will feel the presence of will see and feel that God is here Daniel as shy as he was he was just smiling looking down don't take them all King I wasn't asking you Daniel I was just telling them that I'm giving you then that one was who was in the highest in Babylon the king just looked at him what do [Music] you explain to me why am I not firing you from your position hey this days compan are they don't fire you like you are fired they ask you why we must not fire you hey life then that man he just decided to I'm just going to stay in my sh and then he had the old Bon must listen to Stage when they look at that stage wasi then even King said to Daniel worship yourself amen amen Daniel was a soft brother me read what I'm saying brother said about Dani he was so shy kind of question and answers Daniel had three friends shra and brother says Daniel being the leader the leader as Christ being the leader of the church and they was bow before the image to worship to the image notice when you notice in those times Daniel was silent he was just looking praying in the hand God you know better amen amen oh I and I hope you get this Daniel was silent letting they had to make their own choice if it was David he was not going to be like Daniel he was going to say straight I won't do that otherwise I will let that go that the interet of to kill you that was David but with Daniel he was silent he looked down and said Lord God you know better let them have their choice but their choice should be by your guidance their choice should be your choice live it like that that was Daniel amen amen and they made the right decision amen when you are a child of God you will always meet the right because God will give you the guidance amen amen question and answers on the seals Nebuchadnezzar made that stage of a man okay uh I want it where it says okay yes here let me continue with it spirit that man had he had a revelation or he made an image but his Revelation was Daniel a religious man being woried because he named him Bel which was the name of his God that was Nebuchadnezzar after he realized that the intelligence of the intelligence of Babylon has failed but through the intelligency of God that was in Daniel Daniel should be above all you know this thing of honoring the people with statues started long time ago so he honored Daniel but making a stage after making a stage that stage was Daniel then he said to the people the only God that we can worship is God of Daniel amen amen now watch the the Gentile kingdom was issued in the days of babyon by King Nebuchadnezzar a gentile King the church and the state together by taking a holy image of a holy man and forcing worship to eat Gentile Kingdom ends in the feet on the handwriting on the wall by a political power that United Church and the state together to force the kissing image same image of a holy man amen amen then he he realized that this government is ruled by the intelligency the Chans the sorcerers the magics whiches those people they rule in Babylon and he realized that for him to continue with he will not make it he needed Daniel who God condescended upon him he put a a picture in the middle a statue in the middle for this people and Daniel's people come in common and worship the state of Daniel he bring the church and he bring the politics he bring the state together then the church become compromised if the church goes with the state it's a compromised Church amen amen now the kingdoms come it was Babylon at the end of Babylon here comes the m and the pous and then gree and then Rome when you look at the picture you will see that at the end is iron at the end and day on the TW is iron mixed with clay that Kingdom tells you that is compromised it doesn't have that power anymore but when you remove the clay the Ste is there the iron there let's go to go to the Book of Revelation will not read I'm just going to tell what the prophet say in Revelation 13:14 we learn that does the Beast spread his influence through the image amen amen the image which was built for him those images are not innocent they influence our lives the image that was made is a worldwide ecumenical council where all the organized churches will get together with the Roman Catholic they are doing it even now it is quite simple thing this Union will come in order to stop the power of Communism but since communism it's like Nebuchadnezzar has been raised up to bend the Flesh of the hot Rome will be overcome and destroyed amen amen during the time of Rome I I will start there going there during the time of Rome Rome had this thing called paganism the paganism is when they have you know those dictators their mandate was to kill you you know a dictator is someone who will kill when you do not agree with him when you do not agree with him he will kill you either physically or your reputation Romans EMP pars they were dictators and they were mandated to kill now they kill until they bese Jerusalem surrounded their walls when they surrounded their world during the time of Titus he killed all of them until even they say the way the blood was flowing was like a river flowing amen and then the whole world started to be scared of Rome that Rome can kill amen amen you know they used to call they call this man Nero Nero when they talk about him they say he was a cruel man amen amen now we've got the people called Strat here comes the one by the name of Constantine constant time realize that this thing of killing is not going to work we need to do something he came with a strategy he come with a strategy he was in the government when he was there conversing for the elections he went to the Christian to pray for him so that he can win the election when he won the election he will be able to protect them now the Christian you know prayed for him he won the election after winning the election when he's in church he compromised the government he compromised the Christian for he brought them together amen amen when you read the book of the church ages brother Bram says so constant time invited the nominal Christian the First Christian Church of Rome to help C the Christian behind him as they were very large body when he there he elected leaders among them that when you go to your churches you need to read this not from the Bible they took an abstract from the Bible make an hybrid out of it and give to the church and a church becomes a compromised Church the Church of God all along was baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus but when Constantine come he said to them you must baptize in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost they are compromised because brother BR the other day he was praying for someone I think it's India over the table then he said in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost the table stay there in the name of the Le of Sheron in the name of Jehovah all the names the table was still on suspend but when he said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the table fell out and broke into it tells you that the name Lord Jesus Christ power when you pray if you can say in the name of Jesus it's not enough if you can say in the name of the Lord is not enough if you can say say in the name of Jesus Christ it's not enough you must say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says when you do things in your hands amen and even everything in your entire life do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you will see the power of God now Constantine Conan compromise the Christian of the day and then that was the beginning of the CL that was mixed with from paganism papism amen amen you know papalism is when the government and the church became and they started there and then the Christian started to live the compromised life amen that is politic amen amen Julius will call [Music] you Pastor we are in a rally come and pray open the prayer in our Manifesto you go there and pray after praying he stand up after your prayer another with you are compromised you can't amen amen politics is of the devil you can justify it amen amen there's another brother here in church he calls the brother enma is it or is it a flower when youe just like Enigma talking I'm sorry I'm just get reminded when I say politics is of the devil but that's brother Constantine Constantine started it amen amen it's like when the brothers wanted to start a business they said BR imagine and you starting the business spoken the spoken things going smooth yeah you just read it once from there on you now search which is one which one is the best because you'll end up being both of you spoken Gathering D there you better consult with the pastor and if the Pastor said no stop the thing I like it when Pastor edar from Mal wanted to start a business he found a pastor he said to the pastor I want to start a business so and so and so the pastor said to you you are a pastor responsible for a church in Malawi that kind of a business want to start you will forget about the word of God and the pastor in Mal stop that can we be like him myself I want million but if millions are not for me I will remain with this 100 but I must PR my God Amen I had another brother started a business he started he's making a lot of money then when he was giving us the speech he said in business we deal with [Music] literally yeah but you kid maybe not literally but you work somebody out in order for you to be in yeah I'm sorry I'm note so I'm on the iron and Clay because he at the end in the iron and Clay being the end of the world since Nebuchadnezzar saw the thing Daniel explained to him we have our Prophet brother brother Bram who lived in this age when God raised him he showed him the vision vision it's something that you see when everything is clear God just come down and show you amen amen now there were seven major Vision that the I'm not going to read all of them I'm just trying to pick this one I want to show you this brother said my my first Vision this was in June Sunday morning June 19 333 God open the door for brother BR and he saw Visions he said my first Vision was that M would invade would invade ethopia you see this thing hasn't happened but it's like going to happen all right and that Nation will fall at his steps that Vision surely did cause some reperations and some were very angry when I say it and will not believe it the the vision that happened in 1933 where things were smooth brother said I see from Italy invading Africa invading ethopia the people in the world said no this is a wrong Prophet this false prophet that is not true they started to hate him but God show him that but it happened that way he just woke in with his modern arms took over the native didn't have a chance but the vision also said mol would come to a horrible end with his own people turning on him that came to pass just exactly as it was [Music] they're historians if you read history or follow it we see this Vision exactly happened in 1935 brother BR saw it in 1933 in 1935 invaded after killing the people there he think he is enjoying his glory condescended upon his own people and he said to them this man killed my people in Africa deal with him they killed him his own people after killing him they took his wife and his keys to jail you see brother Brenham the true prophet of God he saw it and tell to the people and the people started to hate him brothers sisters the world may hate you stay to the course if they hated brother BR they should hate you today don't be a man pleaser stand for what you belied in said to them I can't do nothing I'm just a ver if God show me something and said I must talk to the people so be it in 1933 the very same year so Hitler rise up as a dictator in Germany and take the nation into war and the people couldn't believe it then Hitler came to amen the whole of Germany then I read the story of Hitler then I realized that Hitler did not win the elections because the people loved him but the present prime minister and his death bed he asked his people his deputies that Germany should go somewhere I need someone who can take it somewhere where I want it be there then this one said yes I am I will take it then this prime minister said to him you have a heart of a chicken you won't make it Germany is powerful Germany is strong Germany conquer the world I someone then everybody was like then he said to them I will speak against my own way like did I speak against my own way Moses even if he was against Egypt Moses is the man then this man said to them the whole of Germany I see Hitler the opposition he will take Germany where Germany to be that's how he came into Power he killed 6 million Jews killed a lot of people in the Holocaust and you go and read that history that's what he did then how he died was a mystery brother Bram said it when Hitler died it will be a mystery the people will not know hey when you read the history one will say this one will say this one will say he shot himself one he said he drink a poison when he said shoot his wife shoot his himself when he said the Russians came there were a lot of things around him but brother Bram says the death of Hitler will be a mystery and it happened exactly amen amen he said the third one it was political I see three isms the fism the Nazism and the communism trying to get together I was reading the history as well you know Italy Germany and Russia they were trying to come together but they could not agree because at the end the prophet says they will never agree but communism will swallow them all you know the word of God must be fulfilled all those things they happened exactly in that way amen amen then he continues say the fourth one I saw a car without a steering wheel shaped like an egg in a free way the people even playing cards come on this is unbelievable in 19333 you see this you believe it today because you are in 2024 but even 1968 even in 1968 you wouldn't have believed it because when you sleep or maybe you close your eyes try to imagine a car without a driver it's impossible how many are there today that was a prophet that said in 1933 but is happening today even the cars we are driving today they speak to us when you are drunk says I'm not going anywhere you are so drunk then and then it will just park itself there it's your car if you are drunk want rest a coffee you are tired they talk to us that is how technology advanced amen amen the fifth one he said I see the moral of the women yeah this one let me know go deeper because it's like a life normal I was talking to someone way you are lying it becomes normal it becomes just normal language to you is just lies if you can't lie same tune today with women I don't know what if I can say this but they The Prostitute of the old days better than the Christians today you want communicate me for that I won't take it fair amen amen amen the sixth one amen they arose up in America the most beautiful the most beautiful but a cruel woman she held people in her complete power I believe that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in due to a popular V by a woman amen amen so if a woman is conversing for presiden The Other Women will vote for him and then it happens with Kamala Harris when he became the Vice President of America and then the highest position after president is the vice president now the that woman in that position power I want to tell you this that the woman has power Obed was old and even forget some species but Kamal will be the one that was in church amen amen and then brother Bram says even the word of God says when the woman started to have a control that nation is doomed amen amen now that woman was in charge of America be in charge of America in charge of the world because America America is the super power Nation amen amen if America speaks the rest only receive but don't come close to me because I will deal with you and the American will say you but have you seen a coward I'll slap you but hold me other I you he knows that if he can go him but just to show him that I'm Not Afraid knowing that if he can go be disappointed so Russia will say to USA you can talk but don't come here you come here you will regret amen so those are the visions that brother they happened exactly if Cala as a woman was in charge the end of the world the end of everything amen am so it shows you that in a matter of time Rapture will take place the last Vision was when I had the most terrible explosion as I Look to as I look I saw nothing but the de the crat and the smoke all over the land of America amen that's what brother those seven Vision I want to say another Vision here was a b controversial as I was reading about it brother the other day he said to where are you standing bip said to him I'm here in May Building Los Angeles then he said to him before you get old the Sharks will swim around that building where you are standing yeah yes and then the years goes by the year goes and it's 2024 today and then the the people say brother bam is a false prophet because Billy died last year when he was 82 years of age but we never saw the shark swimming in theing our God cannot fail they say in 1970 B Paul was still young was not yet old a certain family that believed the message were working in the building May building as they were working there one of the days there was earthquakes in angels when there was an earthquake in the announcement was made a memo from the city council telling the people and in the main building say you inside the building do not go out the shars are swimming in the basement our Prophet cannot fail sck to the prophet stick to this message he has never failed if you are not sure of anything ask your pastor is a man in charge of the church to give you the explanation he's looking after your soul he is your Shepherd you'll get God bless you listen to our feet amen amen let's let's sing [Music] a amen amen let's sing that song
