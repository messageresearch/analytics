Description:
Title: House dedication of Sbusiso & Kholofelo Nkabinde And Elder Nkabinde & Sister Nkabinde Wedding vows renewal , blessings of rings. 
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Boksburg( Dawn Park), on 21 March 2024 

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
John 15:5
Hebrews 3: 1-4
Ephesians 4:30

The purpose of this sermon was to dedicate the House, Blessing of rings and officiate the renewal of the wedding vows.

Without God you can do nothing. You can build a big house ,  but if it is done without him you have done nothing . He is the creator of all things.  We come from the mind of God
Your body is a building. 

Everything that was created has an ending. You were not created but your body was created. The real men is the one who was not created. Before there was any creation you were there in him, waiting for creation. 
 We are not alone, when you are sick and threatened you are not alone he is always with us. 

Let your houses become God’s houses, Jesus Christ should be the owner of the house. If it is your house you won’t dedicate a house if it is yours and not for Jesus. 

The house of a child of God  is the house for all the people. It welcomes everyone. 

Partakers of the heavenly calling, you are not called by the Church . When you are a Christian you have a profession. 
 Men cannot build all things, God can build all things, and building doesn’t end up with bricks. 
You find some big houses but inside those houses there is no harmony no peace because their lives are not in Jesus Christ. You need your house to be dedicated . It is God’s wisdom to dedicate your house. Our security is God. 
Everything you do, do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Not in the name of father son and holy ghost.

Abraham's area it doesn't rain like other [Applause] places if you look at other countries you see that truly the Lord has been gracious to us we blessed amen we are on the S of the Seed of Abraham know how they separated when and the Bible says that was before was destroyed and Abraham and his SE they saw the other side where there was no judgment there was no judgment coming there we are happy to see the Saints from tan can you please I you know today I'm I'm just going to take some few minutes or God is going to take those min have you introduced the [Music] Saints will be they are because Hallelujah am today he has been baptized amen [Music] [Music] hallelujah so he's a very close friend of mine [Applause] you know I was SE there looking around and [Music] then but because I was not sure a big duck here that's why I asked you to okay no God bless you all brother God bless you and we are here just for [Music] to amen hallu amen you know your houses amen okay I going to read the scripture and I prog not to belong but to be perfect I just asked our brother who is no I was outside there with brother you still remember and I said to him get us the scripture John 15 John 15 ver 5 yes because I usually do that to brother my Harvest so get me that scripture and we will read that scripture and proceed again to read that scripture I shall not famous scripture I shall not say famous scripture but that is Hebrews chapter so you know the scriptures there's more and more like we read where the Bible says if the Lord doesn't build a house I think 127 if the Lord doesn't build a house the builders are building in vain now let us get that scripture starting with John 5 and then we take HEBs also let's bow our heads our heavenly father Heavenly Father we come [Music] today and believing that you are here with us you are here before the foundation of the world you saw this place yes you knew about this predestinated it and the father you planed the whole events to take place in this house for we believe that before there was anything you were there that's why the Bible says we were chosen CH in you we were chosen in you not in any church but in you before the foundation of the world father we are your thoughts made manifest we are the manifested thoughts of the almighty God that's why Satan has got no rights and Satan has got no power over us that's why even those that are sick will will be healed just now because that was the power of God that by his stripes we were healed father we thank you we are in this house but this house father was molded by amen but he who molded all things is God even our bodies are buildings molded by day but it depends who dwells in that bu in this building so thank you Lord as we open the scriptures speak to us for the moment of blessings that the father you have called us to this place bless this m here father's Sons young men in this house because you are with us here in Jesus Christ name I pray amen am John 15 ver 5 I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing Hebrews chapter 3 verse 1 to 4 wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and the high priest of our profession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much as he who have build the house as more honor than the house for every house is builded by some men but he that build all things is God Amen you may be seated bless let's take that first scripture say it just say it I am I am the vine you are the branches he that apped in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing amen without me you can do nothing means nothing amen amen I can build a house bigger than this one but if it is without him because he is the creator maybe you have this I can build a house bigger than this one and put expens without I have in the beginning was and God created all things that's why we we came from the mind of God am he's a mighty Builder know this body of mind buing is a building then he said again I'm going to prepare for you a place so that where I am you to should be all right every day as we were coming I saw some new houses down there but yet I I've got the scripture I'm still waiting for the place amen whose maker and Builder is God all what I've seen shall pass I know very well everything that you look at as long as it is a creation it will pass away we read to you where it says everything that was created why it can be confusing to somebody there's what we call creation but you were not created your body was created hallu amen amen so the real real man is the one that was not created because this one is temporary in this one God has put a theop never amen shall never go to hospital he is forever and ever and ever forever is not even enough because talking about forever talking about the space of time the of the that is in is etal is not forever he is etal that's why we have read that everything that was created shall come to pass because you you were not created God it says God created all right amen but you know before there was any creation you were there waiting foration just get that Ephesians chapter 4 ver again verse 30 okay somebody can read it and grief not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption right stop there a bit when is the day of redemption okay you fear to say when is the day of redemption to redeem is to take something back to his original now the day of redemption is the day as I have read what the prophet has said says the day of redemption is the day the book of redemption was opened it's called the day of redemption that's why the one that sat on the throne and had a book in his right hand your name was in that book amen uh all the redeemed the chosen of God their names it was so special that it was in the hand of the one that on the until the time when the book was opened amen am and when it was opened it was opened for me and you to be able to see ourselves in the book this book um the other part of the book what what is it called there's two parts of the book one part was sealed with Seven Seals sealed with Seven Seals on the on the it was with that's why now that's now the ministry we have the min all right now I read this because I just want to close now it says without me that's why I believe this word of God because I know myself I know that without him I can do nothing yes I believe that because I have realized that without him there's nothing that I can do or can you do something without amen he the doer of all things now that's why everything in the temp in the Bible the buildings were dedicated the temp wased and whatever was put in that Temple was also am so that's why every child of God after building because is not dedicated is vulnerable Satan can crush it is not dedicated to the Lord right that's why we read in the Bible we realized that all things were dedicated if it is notated not end of the it is yours and if it is yours Satan can destroy it but if it is God Satan no you know I'm talking like this I think this will make you wonder I believe that you have heard me when I said I'm going around dedicated but I don't remember my house did I dedicate my house where is do do is she [Music] here in the house okay I think she dedicating in the okay now let's do this before we pray we call now I told some brothers I'm preparing for a day foration of everything in my my in my house but every day before I can sleep I dedicate sorry I can't call you at that time that's in the middle of the night and sometimes usually I sleep all right now every night I dedicate my house my the BL of Christ I dedicate because I know that without him without Jesus I'm nothing amen you should know that in your life can have money nothing nothing at all without that's why he says without me take it on without me so everything that you you think you are doing says is nothing everything that he did not create to him is amen a house is a house if it is after it is dedicated to him it is because without him there's nothing you got nothing you can have billions money lovers are all right let me read here I was with a brother he's not here today we were walking a certain now here comes a man and I could see just by looking at him because he said to us he came through the he came through the people to us and said I have left my children my wife without food amen and I was with brother he has left children all right now you say what if he is just a cook when I look at him not a cre I told you one day that we [Music] were with can I repeat it as we were standing at the mall there were so many people there but God Made Me to look at a certain woman she was going around there a child her hand and she just looked at us we were some away but she looked around and she looked straight at us and she she was among the people but I could see was looking at us while wondering why that woman she's looking at us then she came with this child in the hand straight to us going through the people and stood right before us and they said me and my child can I say we are hungry and the man I was with she said there something in their language I couldn't understand but you just say then I took money out of my pocket so I what what do you what do you think she can do for herself and the child make sure that it should shoot up to searching and you realize that you don't then it makes you li it makes you right and then I said pastor this woman was standing there child then suddenly she are then she came just like that woman oh man she came from behind because there was a pool when Jesus was there you know if you are a child of God you are a PO amen so I told the men of God I said she came I was watching she came straight to us passing through has seen she has seen somebody you know [Music] today people and all that you know what Isen in the but the here uh they saw only one man the Lord Jesus Christ amen but there so many around here sakes and all that but after building before they started building there was something in them building a house for the Lord a delling place all right as I told you about that woman Dre she said she dreed Satan mes them in the house every night sleep then what did she do I told you because every night they couldn't sleep people cannot sleep many people can't sleep every night we have met them even last Sunday that Sunday even that Sunday they come say we can't sleep [Music] there's this and this and this on the roof sister came and said every time I jump into my bed then there that understand then I hear that there's somebody now in the I am now I told you that I want you to put amen you must put something of God and many of you know what was that and she did that's why the song says I'm not alone only if you can know that you are not alone there is somebody we go to we used to go to some and some things that's when we were Al the said I shall be with you the end of the world so we are not even when you are threatened you are not when you are sick you are not the brothers were there I think is it last week or a week before last week here come couple with a girl and the Hand of the this girl was sticking right down like this now they said this has just happened to our daughter and I said then I I said to the girl just greet me then she stretched and I said do this she did that were you was there there yeah he was there then she could raise the hand now that was not uh uh the first thing that we have SE all right after that she took a paper and wrote on a paper toate to us that now she can write because the thing when I was told that this child just happened the first thing I knew that she's not alone I am not alone then we greet one another without because we have the third po what happened last week last Sunday because there's so many testimonies only are they are just bound with with the SE and the Bible says ton do what5 amen but seems as if the people don't see you must preach the whole word of God what have you seen last week that woman came oh okay there was a woman that came she had a stick and then her legs were she was having pain with her legs so when he arrived the pastor the pastor asked the questions and the sister answered then Pastor started to to lay hands upon her on those legs that sister was not she was so surprised because just out of that the pastor asked where's the pain the pain was no more and in she was walking all around from the office going up and down and he was so happy that the pen is gone and we got a video for that woman for that sister with us amen she was working on whated [Music] after all right because she is not alone she didn't know that not [Music] is the owners of this house they knew that without him without God they are vulnerable that's why they call the children of God in their house for a dedication so I believe that they have put him in their house him in their house just as I say that woman says she she she's a a Pentecost she went after they had they just use one word they say in the house and then uh what happened in her [Music] dream in Her Dream she saw the Lord Jesus Come into her house now she said to the Lord Lord I will put you I'll rent you that then after that the very same night Satan amen then the woman wondered because they had Jesus in the house now the next day they say she approached the Lord Jesus we have rented you the devil attacked us again in the house we were going up and down if but that house is quiet then the Lord said I've done what you have of [Music] I use that room then that said all right Lord now the whole house is yours everything we we are now renting in this house that day their house was peaceful because they have given all to him but you can do that only that you have received from him because sometimes if a person has just build a big house you'll find him standing like [Music] this standing in the front door even when you greet them you can see that yes the children call child of God's house is not make your let your houses become God's houses now brother the first name was the first name of the owner all right the owner know Jesus your first name now here we here to dedicate your God's house because you you W's beings even the visitors are special some are not um welcomed in that house the house of Christian is the house of all every person is welcome if it is a dedicated House of God there are some houses where there's a selection of some people don't come to that house only few people but the house of a child of God is the house of everybody you know that we know of houses where some people are welcome some are not welcome that is not of God that is of that particular person but the house of God is the house for all the people all right so that's far now the last scripture here that Hebrews you know I love that scripture I love this one without me God says God says without there's nothing we can do I know of myself that without you let me tell you the truth before God every day if I go to sleep I tell God again that this was your day because since this morning to this it was you so this was your day this is your night have you heard me say when the natural sun goes down and that is Christ amen the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want when the Sun goes down he looks after he becomes my shepher when I'm not conscious of anything he is there as my shepher he looks after you when you wake up in the morning he is still with you that's why the morning we pray say thank you Lord you are with me the whole night because when the natural son goes down there is another son that is the Son of God Amen and when you sleep you are out of yourself no there must be [Music] another because when you sleep you don't see you don't hear that's right now there must be some in you all right now I'm I will close by saying what did that scripture say of Hebrews the last thing I read this scripture almost every day just start from verse one a bit verse one wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high Prest of our profession Christ Jesus partak you are not called by a church not aor partakers partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and priest of our profession Christ Jesus hey meaning that a Christian you have that's profession amen did you hear our Christ Jesus yes our profession that's my profession if even if you haven't been to school but still you have a profession amen am because you know today a person goes to school then after he has passed GPA and [Music] what they say he has a profession but listen to the right they call the word of God uh law if God says do they say it's a law all right amen now tell us about the profession profession consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus okay who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much as he who has builded the house has more honor than the house for every house is builded by some men but he that buth all things is godallah I think we have reached our point every day we read this scripture every house is build by but heaning cannot all yes because building don't just need bricks bricks the Bible says men can build with bricks but that's not all but he that bu all things meaning that building don't just end up with breaks amen we were somewhere I want call the country by name a brother came for us at to pick up from the airport visiting the country now on our way to his house he was poting at some houses you know you see that the OWN professor of they have problems he was pointing them because they have problems m m but divor they are divorced there you see the house there's nothing there's no people there they found that the owner aief he steals money and he does this he's in jail the house is he shows that that one the husband is left only the wife was showing us big houses why the house of the brother it's the it's God's not a blessed house now because you find some big houses but inside there you know it's just fights and no Harmony no peace in that house why they not in Christ now last he who builds all things after people have build they call who's renting somewhere yeah yes he's a te somewhere else sisters were there at my house now they came for consult and I said to them a man who has no God buys a car after that they go to a person who doesn't have a car then they ask him to hold to keep it amen they come with an expensive car they go to an old man who lives in a small sh he knows that he's going to make money from unbelievers won't come to you a Christian they take a car they go when they reach the place it's going to be smeared with d they say we ask that you keep it because people now I ask them please keep it for us this but you say You must keep your car why doesn't he have his own why doesn't he keep his own they build a house after that they go to a poor old man Old Woman Who resides in a 10 then they ask her to keep the house you'll find that the owner has a shows this man has this things as a diploma he doesn't have you'd rather have life amen what we need is life it say now if the Lord doesn't build you you who build God tells you that you don't have the material to build you will build but you won't live in that house in peace even the wies come in am at night even the other day people are not sleeping at night in big houses they don't sleep the other one said I had someone washing the dis in the kitchen while they were sleeping you need to dedicate your house we

in my I'm going to read something I don't know whether I should explain this or you just briefly explain [Music] why [Music] it came to my heart then I spoke to Mama and I spoke to my boys so I have a longing to do that that we came from a denomination and we were blessed there When we married me and her but now that we are here I I told them I've got a pastor now and I want to correct the blessing of our marage are P but there is a pastor then I spoke to the ERS they spoke to the pastor are corre the blessing of the Lord Upon Our Lives we were baptized in the name of the the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost there but when we arrive where God is there was a correction so we are correcting also this amen amen oh yeah now not not preaching but you remind me of I was with the sister last Sunday remember one on one after I her she some questions then at the end she say I think I must be baptized I was baptized she from what church was that Gospel of Faith Mission or something like that Full Gospel of Faith Mission now she says but I think bapm was the right one I said which one she says the usual one in the name of the father son and and I said what is that mean because Father Son and Holy Ghost there but in the name of the father I made it so simple he was the father to isra for to die he became a son the body ofh then after that his father son then after that he ascended up to heaven the Holy Ghost came down those are the titles [Music] and he said in now we know that father son and H Father Son and Holy [Music] Ghost now if you baptize them in the name the Bible says you do all things the name is Jesus Christ Father Son and Holy Ghost not the name the name is Jesus Christ now if you are in and like the woman she came complaining I was with the brother preacher I'm

and the Holy Ghost he said the father there was no son he said father and Holy Ghost and after that he said after I was baptized then he said Saints I've done a little mistake but you when we baptized the mother I forgot the I said when you make them three you will always forget so Peter came now Peter came all of youed in the name now in everything you do the Bible says do it in the name of father
