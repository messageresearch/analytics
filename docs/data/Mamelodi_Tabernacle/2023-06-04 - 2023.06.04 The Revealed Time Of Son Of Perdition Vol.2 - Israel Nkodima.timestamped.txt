[27:08] time in
[27:10] again we hear the gospel preach all the
[27:13] time like you hear about the Lord Jesus
[27:18] but fella
[27:21] what happens when we you really look at
[27:25] him
[27:31] this is what caused me to break down he
[27:34] says
[27:36] that's when I
[27:39] foreign
[27:42] you know go back to that Revelation
[27:46] chapter 21 I'll show you something
[27:54] Revelation 21 from verse 1.
[27:59] and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth
[28:02] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[28:04] were passed away and there was no more
[28:07] sea and I John saw the holy city New
[28:10] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[28:13] Heaven prepared
[28:16] right I mean now listen get a tillage
[28:20] God said in Genesis
[28:25] he created God created heaven
[28:29] [Music]
[28:33] now when
[28:36] this man of God looked
[28:40] at this time
[28:42] all right
[28:44] the first time it was just so dumb yeah
[28:47] but when he looks
[28:52] you see
[28:54] now we have gone through some things
[28:57] every
[28:59] now now we want to look at them
[29:06] we talked about the Battle of form again
[29:10] but now we are coming
[29:12] back again
[29:15] and now we are coming for to look
[29:22] and that's when you say when you look
[29:28] about it
[29:30] yeah you've been seeing things
[29:33] but there's a time when you lose
[29:39] okay amen
[29:41] gospel is not like
[29:44] after hearing about something
[29:50] and it is no it is just to say hey that
[29:54] message was wonderful
[29:56] have you seen some marijuana amen
[30:00] [Music]
[30:01] all right now I will read this part here
[30:07] I've got a few things
[30:14] it speaks of this
[30:19] uh
[30:21] this Thessalonians
[30:27] and now you know
[30:32] let no man deceive you by any means
[30:39] for that day shall not come except there
[30:42] came they come off Falling Away
[30:51] and you know falling away blinds the
[30:54] people so much
[30:59] Here Comes fooling away first
[31:04] and that man of sin be revealed
[31:12] well there's a time
[31:14] when you are talking about men of sins
[31:18] but yeah it is talking about the time he
[31:22] is
[31:23] [Music]
[31:27] you can spend many years talking about
[31:29] Jesus
[31:31] but there's a time when he is revealed
[31:34] to you
[31:36] it's different than just hearing about
[31:40] Jesus
[31:42] they revealed Jesus
[31:45] it's not the Jesus you've been hearing
[31:50] about it
[31:51] it is the revealed one amen
[31:57] that's why people hear about Jesus talk
[32:00] about Jesus
[32:11] they talk about the men of sins
[32:13] [Music]
[32:15] it tells us about it it says when he is
[32:24] foreign
[32:41] that's why you know how to go about it
[32:44] because
[32:45] if you don't know him by Revelation
[32:48] you can worship but at the end of it
[32:53] still take another one
[32:55] like you look at sodium
[32:59] and you see nice things

[58:48] what does that means
[58:53] he's not talking about something that
[58:56] happened back there
[58:58] he's standing in the game
[59:05] and
[59:08] it was proven
[59:10] when he received amen
[59:17] the Gap is of that man Adam back there
[59:25] Adam Adam
[59:27] when he forfeited the post
[59:32] and
[59:33] it belongs to men not
[59:36] Angel yeah
[59:42] you know if God were to replace Adam
[59:45] with something else would say God Was
[59:48] Defeated
[59:56] much
[1:00:03] but when he was defeated
[1:00:06] then Allah something else then we he
[1:00:10] passed with something
[1:00:14] Where is the
[1:00:17] the law now
[1:00:20] of reproduction
[1:00:24] restoration
[1:00:26] coming from
[1:00:29] it puts back
[1:00:32] things
[1:00:35] everything that was shifted
[1:00:39] says
[1:00:44] restoration
[1:00:47] he's taking them back just like you
[1:00:51] if you were predestinated
[1:00:54] and seals are open

[1:01:19] is they kept closed nah because
[1:01:25] when we fall Hits a game we left again
[1:01:30] that's why Adam
[1:01:32] left again
[1:01:37] the position of a man
[1:01:40] in Christ
[1:01:43] is an eternal position
[1:01:47] if you shift it lives again
[1:01:54] foreign
[1:02:25] end
[1:02:26] God wouldn't allow it to remain like
[1:02:29] that is
[1:02:34] that would signal that God Was Defeated
[1:02:43] now if you go back you find men the men
[1:02:46] again standing there
[1:02:50] now you know that
[1:02:53] was the the law of restoration
[1:02:58] that man is back there

[1:12:24] we of the Seed of Abraham
[1:12:28] are able to see
[1:12:32] just like Abraham
[1:12:35] did you know that is
[1:12:44] [Music]
[1:12:46] and the Bible says they have seen these
[1:12:50] things
[1:12:55] do you know the scripture
[1:12:58] amen
[1:13:00] that is a Genesis chapter
[1:13:06] is it 11.
[1:13:09] who who else can tell us about the
[1:13:11] scripture
[1:13:15] uh
[1:13:18] Abraham God spoke to the Bible says
[1:13:22] Sarah also
[1:13:24] receive strength to
[1:13:27] conceived
[1:13:30] that scripture amen Genesis chapter 21.
[1:13:34] [Music]
[1:13:41] you don't have your church he Plus 11.
[1:13:46] through faith also Sarah has
[1:13:48] self-received strength to conceive sin
[1:13:51] and was delivered of a child when she
[1:13:54] was past age because she judged him
[1:13:56] faithful who had promised
[1:14:00] salaping therefore sprung there even of
[1:14:04] one and him as good as dead so many as
[1:14:08] the stars of the sky in multitude and as
[1:14:11] the sandwich is by the seashore
[1:14:14] innumerable
[1:14:16] this all died in faith not having
[1:14:19] received the promise but having seen
[1:14:21] them are far off and were persuaded of
[1:14:25] them and embrace them and confess that
[1:14:28] they were strangers and pilgrims on the
[1:14:31] earth amen amen amen amen
[1:14:34] Abraham
[1:14:38] it says
[1:14:42] you know
[1:14:45] eagle has seed
[1:14:50] in England
[1:14:54] and England will see exactly like the
[1:14:58] mother
[1:14:59] um
[1:15:03] okay it is born with that
[1:15:08] no that's why now we of the Seed of
[1:15:12] Abraham and
[1:15:17] this is the last mile of the way
[1:15:20] [Music]
[1:15:23] we are going to see that

[1:15:47] what it says
[1:15:49] no
[1:15:50] sir Sarah also
[1:15:53] Vienna
[1:15:54] through cartoon now if Sarah doesn't say
[1:15:58] by faith
[1:16:01] their faith already was the faith of
[1:16:03] Abraham
[1:16:06] so that's why Abraham it says
[1:16:12] it says through faith
[1:16:18] that is already existing
[1:16:23] that's why the faith is given to us
[1:16:28] that is already existence
[1:16:34] if an eagle
[1:16:37] gives birth to an eager
[1:16:40] he doesn't pray for the eaglets
[1:16:45] foreign
[1:16:58] right now when God is like that
[1:17:03] we are born
[1:17:05] Seed of Abraham only pay we are Abraham
[1:17:08] so the vision is
[1:17:14] because you are born
[1:17:17] now that's why it speaks of those
[1:17:21] born after Sarah through faith
