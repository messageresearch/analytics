[1:27:06] okay amen
[1:27:10] and
[1:27:12] this message is preached by the part of
[1:27:16] the message yeah
[1:27:22] you know as we were following another
[1:27:25] direction of the threefold
[1:27:30] Ministry
[1:27:42] so you can be seated
[1:27:47] we have realized that
[1:27:50] it started
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:58] and as he said that day you shall know
[1:28:03] that I am in my father
[1:28:07] and you in me
[1:28:14] how many do you see there
[1:28:21] but he says
[1:28:23] that day
[1:28:25] you shall know
[1:28:28] meaning that he was talking to one part
[1:28:33] of the threefold over
[1:28:40] even yesterday I was looking at
[1:28:43] something
[1:28:46] and
[1:28:48] hey you know this message whatever
[1:28:54] but that's another part
[1:28:58] where he says even the angels of heaven
[1:29:01] don't know
[1:29:05] he's coming
[1:29:10] he said something that is very confusing
[1:29:13] to somebody
[1:29:17] unless you are part of the system
[1:29:29] then we ask which son which is
[1:29:33] amen amen then I realized
[1:29:37] that's part of it here in the book of
[1:29:40] The Seven Seals
[1:29:44] wanted me forever Iranian because
[1:29:50] the Sun
[1:29:51] Adam
[1:29:57] now it is Adam who should know how much
[1:30:00] you are supposed to know
[1:30:05] any other Sun substitute
[1:30:10] it will just pass on to the sun in
[1:30:14] position
[1:30:20] towards a substitute
[1:30:41] you are
[1:30:44] amen
[1:30:47] that threefold
[1:30:50] has saved us
[1:30:53] he is in the father we are in him
[1:31:00] okay amen so the message is coming from
[1:31:03] these three folders
[1:31:04] [Music]
[1:31:07] it's preached by the father
[1:31:12] by us now we are we are the bride of
[1:31:16] Christ
[1:31:18] we are not a message
[1:31:22] that is what they call the message
[1:31:28] the people talking about the message
[1:31:30] churches
[1:31:33] but we are talking about the bride of
[1:31:36] Christ
[1:31:42] so we'll take one part
[1:31:47] which I could say that it remained with
[1:31:52] our pastor yeah
[1:31:57] one part
[1:32:00] is a mediator okay
[1:32:05] and when is he a mediated
[1:32:10] because somewhere it puts him
[1:32:13] not to us not as a mediator
[1:32:23] but under the new Commission
[1:32:28] no the new commission commission is of
[1:32:32] the Angels
[1:32:35] alone all right I mean
[1:32:37] and you know that
[1:32:40] as the prophet says
[1:32:43] okay
[1:32:44] you were there before there was an angel
[1:32:49] [Applause]
[1:32:50] that's why the message
[1:32:56] it is
[1:33:03] okay amen
[1:33:09] we are talking of the
[1:33:11] what as he says
[1:33:17] Angels foreign
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:26] I mean amen not
[1:33:29] when the seventh seal was opened
[1:33:33] actually was revealed
[1:33:37] it says
[1:33:39] the angels of heaven knew the where
[1:33:45] or or owned by it here
[1:33:52] now we have caught up with that
[1:33:55] by God's grace
[1:33:58] thing
[1:33:59] when in heaven
[1:34:04] they saw things now
[1:34:10] where where was The Silence nah
[1:34:16] why
[1:34:19] because they were
[1:34:21] out by age
[1:34:25] when now usually things were sent down
[1:34:31] oh man so in heaven
[1:34:35] not on Earth
[1:34:38] things were sent down
[1:34:41] and heaven
[1:34:43] and all that's in heaven let's
[1:34:50] today let's just read this part
[1:34:54] and
[1:34:55] the Lord willing
[1:34:58] and then
[1:35:00] we will continue and
[1:35:05] foreign
[1:35:08] [Music]

[1:35:49] meetings
[1:35:51] on this side

[1:59:01] Thrones
[1:59:08] you know the Royal people
[1:59:11] are receiving the message from the
[1:59:13] throne

[1:59:58] what what it was what or how was it
[2:00:05] he is referring to a certain time
[2:00:10] you know that's it in time now watch
[2:00:14] there came a man to Abraham
[2:00:20] Abraham
[2:00:24] this man was melchized
[2:00:28] but true
[2:00:36] now with Abraham
[2:00:40] and this milk he said
[2:00:43] as the prophet puts it
[2:00:46] he came through the house

[2:01:00] you know
[2:01:02] a city in the book souls in prison okay
[2:01:05] yes
[2:01:06] I think it's page 42.
[2:01:10] these things are wonderful
[2:01:13] I remember a brother
[2:01:18] there was a place with the
[2:01:21] hell was a bending foreign
[2:01:26] then I read out of this book
[2:01:32] my Prophet tells me
[2:01:35] hell now
[2:01:39] because
[2:01:42] it says Jesus when he resurrected
[2:01:46] he went to hell
[2:01:52] did he go to a Birmingham
[2:01:56] because Satan was there because
[2:01:59] hey
[2:02:02] he says it will start to bend
[2:02:06] and the judgment
[2:02:12] is that nice but right now
[2:02:19] but at the judgments
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:29] that's the residency of Satan
[2:02:35] let us look at this
[2:02:37] now uh
[2:02:39] this brother of mindset
[2:02:42] I thought hell is a burning Place
[2:02:46] yeah I said but not now okay
[2:02:50] according to yeah okay
[2:02:55] no let
[2:02:57] me take this part here
[2:03:02] I'm trying to show something here okay
[2:03:06] just assume
[2:03:08] that we are going to follow the things
[2:03:12] foreign
[2:03:18] [Music]
[2:03:38] of the seven angels
[2:03:41] [Music]
[2:03:43] feeling
[2:03:47] okay now here I'm looking at someone
[2:03:52] here at something yeah
[2:03:55] um
[2:03:56] what is the third pool now okay
[2:04:00] because
[2:04:03] they come as constellations
[2:04:07] and you can only hear
[2:04:13] the word when you are in a constellation
[2:04:19] [Music]
[2:04:20] that's why uh
[2:04:24] brother put in a constellation
[2:04:29] and the message followed
[2:04:32] Amen in the constellations
[2:04:37] you know we we were in the constellation
[2:04:40] of a three-fold
[2:04:45] foreign
[2:04:47] himself said yeah
[2:04:51] that is John
[2:04:55] John 14 20. amen yeah John 14 verse
[2:05:06] he says that is this
[2:05:10] when the threefold Revelation is
[2:05:14] revealed
[2:05:20] you are part of God
[2:05:24] [Applause]
[2:05:25] when the father says something
[2:05:29] originally the very same thing will be
[2:05:33] said by the Sun
[2:05:37] it comes through a three four
[2:05:41] the very same message
[2:05:44] now you realize that when it is a
[2:05:48] three-fold Ministry
[2:05:51] it is coming from a constellation
[2:05:55] of a three-fold revelation
[2:06:00] foreign
[2:06:03] [Music]
[2:06:16] [Music]
[2:06:29] to tell the truth before God
[2:06:32] foreign
[2:06:33] I
[2:06:35] I don't undermine
[2:06:38] the other people again
[2:06:43] [Music]
[2:06:44] but fella
[2:06:46] I know where to
[2:06:49] preach these things
[2:06:53] [Applause]
[2:06:54] I must come to a Shepherd okay
[2:07:01] preaches and believes the same thing
[2:07:05] foreign
[2:07:20] [Music]
[2:07:23] there was one day we can learn by these
[2:07:26] things
[2:07:29] if I read something of you
[2:07:32] then I can look at back
[2:07:36] at it they wait and say then where is my
[2:07:39] position
[2:07:46] blue
[2:07:48] the prophecies you know if God says let
[2:07:52] there be light it's a word
[2:07:57] but when there is life
[2:08:00] a manifestation
[2:08:03] that's the difference
[2:08:07] you can please just save the whole night
[2:08:18] no way but you should follow
[2:08:23] that way because if if he says let there
[2:08:28] be life
[2:08:30] now you can keep on preaching
[2:08:34] God will never repeat that
[2:08:37] because
[2:08:39] I think I've got it here
[2:08:42] let there be light
[2:08:44] now you know the seventh angel messenger
[2:08:48] came and preached
[2:08:50] and some of the things that we we had
[2:08:54] him preaching
[2:08:56] cannot be repeated
[2:09:00] we are not repeating we are manifesting
[2:09:06] Fair now amen you know
[2:09:09] that's why
[2:09:11] when we set for the exam exams
[2:09:18] there would be some teachers walking
[2:09:20] around like this
[2:09:23] shaking
[2:09:25] [Music]
[2:09:26] what you are putting on that question
[2:09:29] paper
[2:09:31] whether it's from yourself foreign
[2:09:42] I mean I mean
[2:09:44] that's what the Bible says examine
[2:09:46] yourself
[2:09:47] [Music]
[2:09:53] we are not using copyrights
[2:09:57] we are the manifestation
[2:10:06] what God did
[2:10:09] and then he's continued the same thing
[2:10:12] the third pool actually
[2:10:16] it's not a preaching positive it is God
[2:10:20] talking through you
[2:10:22] [Applause]
[2:10:25] all right now let us look at it
[2:10:30] when the pastor comes here preaching him
[2:10:34] okay
[2:10:36] today
[2:10:37] that is the word of God
[2:10:43] amen before really and the pastor comes
[2:10:47] for the manifestation
[2:10:50] of that way
[2:10:53] that's why we country we can't come here
[2:10:57] I can't come here and say take off that
[2:11:01] Ministry
[2:11:03] I'm talking to the bride
[2:11:07] you understand
[2:11:08] then take off dance
[2:11:13] that is the thing of the past
[2:11:16] when we come to the bride
[2:11:19] it says
[2:11:27] yeah
[2:11:28] if he is in you how can somebody comes
[2:11:33] whether it's myself and saying
[2:11:38] stop telling lies
[2:11:43] because if he he is in you the way that
[2:11:48] the pastor praise
[2:11:49] it's just a manifestation
[2:11:53] [Music]
[2:11:55] so you should be the way not just you're
[2:12:00] here
[2:12:04] hey where is that so
[2:12:06] it's not just a here amen
[2:12:11] yeah you must sing us that song
[2:12:16] okay
[2:12:18] let's leave this Foundation
[2:12:23] uh
[2:12:24] the prophet speaks of this year
[2:12:28] one another thing yeah
[2:12:32] you know when they were on the table
[2:12:35] there

[2:12:47] experienced squirrels
[2:12:53] among all the people
[2:12:56] it is
[2:13:06] [Music]
[2:13:21] foreign foreign
[2:13:35] [Music]
[2:13:52] foreign
[2:14:08] about the truth

[2:14:31] will show us
[2:14:37] you know hey don't try to say to a
[2:14:40] person
[2:14:42] or he is
[2:14:52] you are talking to a part of the three
[2:14:56] fruits
[2:14:59] but because that one knows that he knows
[2:15:03] when he is a mediator
[2:15:06] and when he is
[2:15:20] because this applies to to us
[2:15:28] you'll forgive me you know
[2:15:35] um
[2:15:37] you know let me but the Bible says I
[2:15:42] will find it here

[2:16:20] you know now there are some the prophet
[2:16:23] comes now you look at him as a signpost
[2:16:27] but when you tend to the commission
[2:16:33] it's something different yes
[2:16:40] the people rally around the scientists
[2:16:46] of looking at the commission
[2:16:50] that's why we'll look at the commission
[2:16:54] what was he commissioned foreign

[2:18:15] how old
[2:18:20] let God be with you Hallelujah

[2:18:33] people
[2:18:36] when you come to the service
[2:18:40] you are not looking at the Second Hand
[2:18:43] Center

[2:25:32] look what
[2:25:35] the wage it is being valid through these
[2:25:40] ages
[2:25:44] according to what God Said oh yeah
[2:25:48] it was opened in the last days
[2:25:52] those Seven Seals should
[2:25:57] be would be broke
[2:26:00] amen amen but it was
[2:26:03] that was the message that was finished
[2:26:07] it's the revelation of the seven series
[2:26:13] the ages
[2:26:15] and the full thing would come into view
[2:26:19] of the people
[2:26:26] the hour of their seventh angel message
[2:26:33] all the Mysteries
[2:26:35] should be made known
[2:26:44] all right we are preparing for something
[2:26:46] amen

[2:27:06] all right
[2:27:10] what makes you too
[2:27:12] okay
[2:27:13] that way
[2:27:17] I it's like this the Lord Jesus says
[2:27:23] no men can come to me
[2:27:26] except the father who has sent to me
[2:27:29] [Music]
[2:27:30] I'm chilling that's what I'm doing
[2:27:35] huh
[2:27:40] what's the meaning of that
[2:27:44] no man can come to me
[2:27:48] except
[2:27:51] he is coming to me
[2:27:53] from where I came here
[2:27:59] that's the only way he can come to me
[2:28:04] amen if I am from the father
[2:28:08] and somebody wants to come to me

[2:52:34] I can't say I go
[2:52:36] I will be wrong to say Amen it's
[2:52:38] something
[2:52:41] that looks terrible to the people
[2:52:45] that's Luke
[2:52:49] Luke 13.
[2:52:51] he's not Mark Mark
[2:52:54] no no one knows
[2:52:57] what's wrong about

[2:54:08] the manual book is
[2:54:16] that's why Revelation chapter five
[2:54:26] because these people
[2:54:31] they are on the right hand side
[2:54:34] well there is Mysteries
[2:54:38] the Miracles and wonders
[2:54:43] is the mystery of God
[2:54:46] all right now if you watch
[2:54:50] he said
[2:54:56] because
[2:54:58] when after they fall of Lucifer
[2:55:02] Lucifer this is the prophet says
[2:55:06] [Music]
[2:55:12] this is what envied him sorry he

[2:55:45] now that's why it is going back again we
[2:55:55] we that is our original
[2:55:58] School our original place

[2:56:11] you know we went there
[2:56:14] let me shall I repeat it again amen what
[2:56:17] is that place well that's what church
[2:56:24] foreign
[2:56:31] foreign
[2:57:07] monitor
[2:57:19] [Music]

[2:57:38] okay
[2:57:40] Adam Adam
[2:57:42] forfeited
[2:57:45] now in the book yeah
[2:57:48] according to the law of restoration
[2:57:53] it was supposed to be returned to the
[2:57:57] man
[2:58:02] now while the people are waiting for
[2:58:04] Adam
[2:58:06] and they don't know him
[2:58:11] I mean
[2:58:16] dropped in the hands
[2:58:20] on their seventh Angels
[2:58:26] now you can count from Adam
[2:58:29] the book from Adam
[2:58:34] eternity
[2:58:40] [Applause]
[2:58:42] it can be the sixes
[2:58:45] because the law of restoration
[2:58:48] should appear in the 70s
[2:58:52] now that is the law of the restoration
[2:58:55] that's why the sons when they are
[2:58:58] restored they are given the seventh
[2:59:01] seeds
[2:59:04] that is
[2:59:12] you have never
[2:59:15] forsaken the sanctions

[2:59:56] not to the angels
[3:00:06] [Applause]
[3:00:35] foreign it and the book yeah

[3:01:48] commission the new commission new
[3:01:50] Commission
[3:01:52] coming with it's a yeah
[3:01:59] yeah that is the new commission
[3:02:06] but this is just the foundation
[3:02:12] and the request of the people
[3:02:15] when they requested
[3:02:18] Joshua we shall hear you
[3:02:20] only fella if
[3:02:24] what hey
[3:02:27] God only if God

[3:02:57] brother
[3:03:00] [Applause]
[3:03:03] okay
[3:03:06] because those people when when Moses
[3:03:09] spoke
[3:03:11] they look
[3:03:13] when Joshua spoke they looked too
[3:03:19] is it from Moses
[3:03:22] because God said
[3:03:24] I will be with you
[3:03:30] foreign
[3:03:36] [Music]
[3:04:02] the people
[3:04:06] could say
[3:04:08] Moses never said that to us
[3:04:15] as it is
[3:04:25] it is not revealed to the public more
[3:04:29] publicly meaning to somebody it is
[3:04:41] Joshua hey Joshua he comes in as the new
[3:04:45] leader is it a new word leader
[3:04:50] amen amen and the people have been
[3:04:55] under their leadership of Moses
[3:05:00] Joshua knows that the people have heard
[3:05:03] already from Moses
[3:05:11] Joshua
[3:05:22] don't think like that
[3:05:25] don't think like that
[3:05:28] they said but
[3:05:30] um
[3:05:38] let me tell you yeah I will show you how
[3:05:40] I read the spirit
[3:05:45] okay
[3:05:46] brother
[3:05:48] so and so says
[3:05:50] he is
[3:05:55] then if you say that I tend to do
[3:05:59] Prophet yeah if
[3:06:06] Joshua comes and he is Joshua hey Joshua
[3:06:09] and you see this brother says he's truth
[3:06:12] foreign
[3:06:14] amen
[3:06:25] amen yes
[3:06:27] now listen to this now
[3:06:32] and now it must have felt
[3:06:36] when Joshua standing there hey Joshua
[3:06:40] anymore that morning talking to God
[3:06:43] he said God said I will not failure
[3:06:47] and as I was with Moses social
[3:06:52] I I be with you
[3:06:56] about you
[3:06:58] as I was with Moses
[3:07:04] [Music]
[3:07:06] now the person who
[3:07:09] actually comes under the ministry of
[3:07:11] Jesus
[3:07:13] you should know this
[3:07:16] what God has said foreign
[3:07:27] Joshua
[3:07:34] [Music]
[3:07:38] now you watch the world
[3:07:42] why because
[3:07:45] while the spirits say is trying to say
[3:07:50] you're listening he's talking with
[3:07:52] himself
[3:07:53] listen to the book now
[3:07:56] [Music]
[3:07:58] uh
[3:08:00] I read
[3:08:02] and the church organization
[3:08:08] they will not take the church over
[3:08:12] God will raise up a new system
[3:08:17] social system enter
[3:08:20] and
[3:08:21] inter-denominational
[3:08:23] systems
[3:08:25] by the power of God
[3:08:29] that will take that
[3:08:33] from his leg Yeah
[3:08:37] don't surrender listen
[3:08:41] organizations and denominations
[3:08:49] each one after their own theology
[3:08:55] that's why I say we should not be a
[3:08:58] message
[3:09:06] because it's only one husband
[3:09:10] um
[3:09:13] now the bride will always
[3:09:15] hear the bridegroom
[3:09:20] because if it becomes churches it
[3:09:23] becomes bridegrooms
[3:09:25] foreign
[3:09:35] [Music]
[3:09:57] into the promised land the power of God
[3:10:02] not a track
[3:10:04] not a track
[3:10:06] not not a track
[3:10:09] amen amen organization and denominations
[3:10:14] each one after his own yeah
[3:10:19] which one after their own way of
[3:10:22] thinking
[3:10:24] but God will take his holy spirit
[3:10:34] man
[3:10:37] amen amen did you hear not reading this
[3:10:46] he is our Joshua okay Joshua
[3:10:50] hey Joshua Joshua is the new man
[3:10:54] who will take the church
[3:11:00] [Applause]
[3:11:02] that's what we are looking for today
[3:11:11] but it is you know when Joshua
[3:11:15] or let's start with Elijah
[3:11:18] what what he did after all the churches
[3:11:22] and the systems
[3:11:29] exactly
[3:11:34] you know you know if the Chariot is
[3:11:37] coming
[3:11:38] look for the right Jews
[3:11:42] [Applause]
[3:11:44] it says
[3:11:47] he will raise them up
[3:11:50] now how do you know that it is
[3:11:59] not taking you on America
[3:12:09] it is what is that Faith called
[3:12:12] rupturing face
[3:12:18] something that is moving
[3:12:21] [Applause]
[3:12:22] because the Bible says Enoch walked with
[3:12:26] God

[3:12:34] and God took him away
[3:12:39] have you seen the plane living now
