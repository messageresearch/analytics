Description:
Memorial Service of Bro Anthony Mantsie.
Title: Moving from Faith to Faith
Preached by Elder Peter Skosana at Leeuwfontein on Saturday 08 August 2024.

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about moving from faith to faith.
The elder read the following scriptures:
Romans 1: 17 | Romans 8: 11 | John 6: 62 | Psalm 24: 7 | John 8: 37 | 1 Corinthians 15: 45

Our brother was blessed because he depended on the inner side. He had the ability to memorize people's voices. When someone is passed on is not dead but he is asleep. 
What will quicken they bodies is a certain spirit that is given to certain people. It is not everybody that will resurrect. If you sleep without that spirit, you cannot resurrect.
When you repent it is by faith. God should bear a witness that John is a forerunner. Moses in Egypt was preaching let my people go, but when in the wilderness he preached the rock, manna and he cannot talk about let my people go.
When they reach Kadesh Barnea God showed him the promised land and his ministry ended. Joshua took over and made them to cross over. 
We talk about being born again and receive Christ, but what comes next. You need a ministry that will impart live. When our brother departs we should know exactly where he went to.
We were in him before the foundation of the world. We came from him and when we leave we return to him. If you sleep without the resurrecting spirit, you will wake up going to the judgement. There are two waiting places, some are waiting for resurrection and some are waiting for judgement.
You don't believe the word of God because you are intelligent. Jesus said all that the father gave me non will be lost. When the word finds a place in you, you do not have to struggle you relax.

uh we are live streaming this uh serviceing that is why I am speaking English we have Believers that would like to attend this memorial service but uh they couldn't make it and and also there are too many and then we have some Believers that are are in Africa speed those that cannot speak or he speed and some of them are in the United States they don't know our language so we're just trying to accommodate [Music] them may you not say this church is a church of white people all nations it's just one to accommodate each other may the Lord bless you uh I would like us to read from the book of Romans uh chapter one and then start read only one verse verse [Music] 17 in English it says chapter 1 verse1 17 uh for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith let's bow our heads Heavenly Father this evening we are gathered here Lord at this memorial service of our beloved brother who has departed amen we pray Lord Almighty that this service should be under your control and under your anointing and under your inspiration we are here Lord Almighty uh having read just one verse amen believing Lord Almighty that you'll expand it and it will find Place Lord Almighty in the hearts of those that have lost their loved one and should we come to a place Lord Almighty where could we could convince them that they haven't lost him actually it's a gain Lord Almighty as Paul says father thank you Lord may you take control may you take everything Lord and give give us Lord Almighty your attention gracious heavenly father as we depend on thee knowing father that our prayer will reach your the target Lord Almighty and also our service Lord the seron will reach the right Target in the precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen am you may be seated God bless you okay the scripture that we have read it says that now the righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to [Music] Faith now before I I continue let me say that yes brother Anton was a friend of ours all uh I always call him as but I didn't know I didn't know how to pronounce that that name man or Mania somewhere there so he will always correct me and say not amen amen so yes we we loved him and then he as the speaker said here he he had a a a very good actually what I would like to speak about is just moving from Faith to Faith now to make you aware that that actually the eyes are just a screen they they cannot interpret the inner man is the one that has got an interpretation so uh that is why he was so blessed because he was living through the inner man he was not depending on the eyes he was depending on the main thing firstly you know we have inner senses I heard Pastor M saying we've got doctor here he will side with me that we've got five inner senses and then that's what Anon was using we we have memory then that is why we we have so many Believers which are more than a or 3,000 but he could memorize each and everyone's voice he was not going to ask you who are you if if I call him and say uh how are you he's going to say uh so he he memorized my voice not that he sat down and scratched his head no automatically once you speak to him and tell him your name he you are already registered in his memory and then he he he could also reason those part part of the the inner senses could reason as you all know he had also imagination he could imagine things right and on and on conscious you know those an affection had all those things but now to me as this young man was saying here he was very interesting he said to me I started knowing that I am a blind man when they took me to a blind school but before that I was wondering why they always pit me home say no why do you write a donkey why do you CL a tree you know that you you can't see you must write it donkey to me it was just a normal life I would play with some other kids I ride a donkey and then one thing that surprised me he said he said to me do you know that I'm from the initiation school so that's part of the things that it really surprised me so now but some other people might say what okay let's go to the word of God I'm I'm giv 30 minutes or 45 years let's talk about this thing the Bible says uh God's righteousness is revealed from Faith to Faith now uh if you read the book of Romans chapter 1 11 here we are in the 11th verse the Bible says uh no chapter 8 not one chapter 8 11th verse can you read it my brother okay in English it says but if the spirit of him that rais up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by you hear what it says it's by his spirit that dwelle in you it will Quicken your your bodies so when when when somebody has passed on he's not dead he's asleep and then uh we who are alive that's what the Bible says we will not prevent them that are asleep see but now the thing that will Quicken the their bodies is a is a certain spirit that will be given to certain people not everybody will resurrect the one that will resurrect is the one as the Bible says that has the spirit it says okay let me read it all but if the spirit of him that raise up Jesus from the dead dwell in you there should a spirit there should be a spirit that should dwell in you and then that spirit will raise you now if you can depart without that Spirit you cannot resurrect are we together the spirit that raised our Lord Jesus Christ should dwell in you you should ask yourself this question have you got that spirit and what kind of spirit is that and where can I get that spirit that raised Jesus and then he says there it must dwell in you right okay fine am now when you repent you repent by faith right amen they you are told by go I me we told about God which you don't know you know your ancestors you don't know about God and somebody comes and take a book this black book some called it is for the white man so he comes with a white man book and introduce God to you and then whatever is going to tell you it will be a push and be a surprise to you until you receive it now he will tell you about heaven he will tell you about the changing of your body it will tell you lot of things you wouldn't know whether to receive it or not receive but now when you receive it that's what we call Faith says faith cometh by hearing what do you hear you hear the word of God now so many people are talking about the word of God and are preaching the word of God until you get confused now which one is the right spirit that can Quicken my body and why do you say this is the right spirit I will I will tell you the Pharisees thees and the scribes were waiting for the Messiah for many years Isaiah prophesied and said a virgin shall conceive and bear a son it didn't say Maria says a virgin shall conceive and then when Maria conceived one can say the Bible didn't say Mar right amen and the Bible says a voice crying in the wilderness for running the Messiah in other words there will be a voice that will point the Messiah it didn't say John the Baptist it says a voice and when John comes they're going to say to him he didn't say you says the voice are we together God should bear a witness that John is the Forerunner but if John says he a forun without God bearing a witness be John saying that so they were waiting for the Messiah we are waiting for the changing our everybody here is waiting for the second coming of Christ changing of this body now how is this body going to change how did they see the Messiah John pointed him and said there's the Lamb of God and then people will say that is his cousin John and Jesus were cousins their mothers were cousins now when he point him and say this is the Lamb of God very few people understood that that is why they look at Christ and look at John look at Christ and look at John and follow John John was saying that is the Messiah we are waiting for but they could not understand that they followed John until John was arrested and while he was in prison he sent them again and said H I understand or they came to him and said that man you pointed he started his own church he baptizing people Jesus said go and ask him whether he's the Messiah and then they went to him and say are you the Messiah he didn't say yes I'm a messiah neither did he say no I'm not the Messiah then he said to them John preached that other side of of Jordan and baptized people you were there and then where did you go there to see were you seeing a re blown by a wind not John in all prophets a born of woman there's no one like John amen did they get an answer no he didn't say yes I'm the mess oh no I'm not the he pointed them to John because John was the for now if they didn't believe that John is a messiah I mean John is the forun they wouldn't see the Messiah yeah in order that they should the Messiah they should see the Messiah must believe that John is the the Bible says behold I will send you Eliah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and He will turn heart of the fathers to their children that's Mal turn the heart of their fathers to the children the fathers had the doctrine of Moses they will never believe anybody when John comes with a Ministry that the ministry now is changing changing the heart of the father to the recent Ministry couldn't believe it and in our time the Bible says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day now that Prophet will turn the hearts of the children to their fathers not fathers to the children but to the the children fathers who is our fathers Paul said I have exped you that's what he said exposed you in other words when he says and you he given you a man that could marry you then when you are married you are the bride in the time that you are living in there's a church in the bride now said when he met after the service he said no I don't think that I will sleep heard some things that I didn't know what were those things those things was the changing of the ministry we call them dispensation now what is a dispensation this is just listen Moses was told to take the children of Israel out of Egypt then he went and said to far let my people go and they and the far released them now when he was in Egypt he was preaching a Ministry Let My People Go no other Ministry until they went out and crossed the Red Sea after crossing the Red Sea he cannot say Let My People Go they out now they're in the desert now change the ministry now that is another dispensation now we speak about Mana that comes from speak about the rock are we together now the ministry is changing it's another dispensation when they reach Kish the River Jordan God showed him and God show him the the Promised Land that was the end of his ministry Joshua took over now now his ministry was to let them cross over he cannot speak about mana on the Rock no you talk about crossing over and after crossing over they reach the promised land and they receive now their inheritance amen now we talk about being born again receive Christ as your savior which is good and after receiving Christ what then you need now a Ministry that will impact life in you now the imparted life is what we call the word of God let's read John chapter 6 John chapter 6 verse why are we here when when when when our brother depart we should know exactly where he went we should not we should not uh probe now we should know where right amen now now verse 61 says verse 61 John chapter 6 it says when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples mmed at it he said unto them does this offend you and then verse 62 that's the one I word what and if you shall see the son of men Ascend up where he was before what if you shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before now it's Jesus that ask them and then he calls himself son of man say what are you going to say if you see this son of man in other words you see myself Ascend to where I was before now the Bible says we were in Christ we were in his mind before the foundation of so where do we come from we come from him and when we go where do we go go to him not everybody goes there it's predestination now if it says predestination it means your destination has been prepared are we together you cannot go to a place that you don't know you come from God and you go back to God that's why you don't die because you've got a spirit of Resurrection you've got a quickening spirit you've got a spirit that will come and collect your soul and collect your body and resurrect you've got quickening spirit and you've got another Qui Spirit those that that that the Bible says we who are alive shall not prevent those that are sleep they slept with a quickening spirit we are here also we've got a quickening spirit are we together amen now the quickening spirit I'm talking about I'm talking about the spirit that will change this Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God are we together this flesh ofana is not needed in heaven I always say you cannot find the in heaven neither could you find a in neither can you find an English man in are we are we together so now this body have to go down so now when somebody depart we are not say this body is departing we talk about his Spirit we talk about his soul Abraham Abraham Isaac Jacob they all departed but when our Lord Jesus Christ died he went to Paradise because they could not go further than that because of the blood of the oxen animal blood it could not take them further that's why he had to die and his blood was the one that that's that's the only blood that can take them further that's why he went there and took them up you read it in in in in the Book of Psalms or should we read it chapter 7 verse 24 so now we are here trying to when when we say uh uh you are some somebody has departed and the people I mean his relatives his friends where uh uh they they they are grieved so the only way of consoling them is to go to the Bible and point them where is their relative and where where are they now here I'm talking about Psalm 24 verse S the Bible says yes uh after our Lord Jesus Christ uh died or he became now a redeemer he started now redeeming because before he could die he was not a redeemer he was not a mediator he became a mediator through his blood and the Holy Ghost uh I mean the the disciples went and went and wait for the Holy Ghost after he has died then he became the mediator now now his blood now you see so now he went to paradise and took Isaac I mean took Abraham Isaac Jacob and everybody that is in paradise and took them now to another level listen what he says as he arrived now where he was toing was taking them he said lift up your heads or ye gates now when it says lift up your heads or ye gates which means he was getting into the gate and the gates were closed so he says open up I am bringing these Believers that's why he says lift up your heads Gates and you be lifted up ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in can we hear it in our you see now he's bringing them to another level look if we have this body here on Earth which we call it a terrestrial body and when we depart we get into another body which is a Celestial Bo you're going to wait in that Bo yeah now there's two places of waiting some are waiting for the the the resurrection some will be waiting for judgment now if you sleep without the resurrection speed then you're going to resurrect when when you go to the judgment amen amen right but if you sleep with a spirit with a quickening spirit we are not going to any judgment according to the word of God you are going to sit on the throne with a groom and judge are we together so now we need to have that what you that that understanding that we are here on all of us the word of God is preached some reject it some receive it we've got three kinds of Believers on this some believe the word of God some they they in between we call them make Believers some don't believe the way there's nothing that you could do it's like that some will not believe it some will be make Believers some will believe it when John came some could not believe it some believe it when our Lord Jesus Christ some did not believe it some believe it some will make believers they were divided and even today it's like that are we together now you don't believe the word of God because you are intelligent no the Bible says it's God that calls you he says he he says all those that the father gave me there's not even a single one that will come out of my and and he knows them he says my sheep knows my voice they could hear that voice master's voice and he will give you the right place and you'll know what to do without look God cannot change or cannot Rapture anybody that is not that is not like him the word of god is perfect and the word of God will make you perfect now when you are perfect God will go for Perfection the Bible says be ye therefore perfect as your father in Heaven isect now God will give you a perfect weight and he will give you a word that will make you perfect you know Jesus Jus said I and my father are one and then what happened you read it in in John uh 10:30 says I and my father are and then now they said to him he said to to them what is my sin just show me one thing that you want me you want to kill me for they said to him you've done lot of great things wonderful things you walk upon the sea you raise the dead you multiply bread we are so thankful for but our problem with you you are a man you make yourself now let me tell you that's that's where the mystery is God must come and receive another God if you read in the book of uh John Chapter 30 verse 35 it says you are God the word of God makes you God and then when God comes he will come and receive God are we together so now unless the word of God which is the seed of God which germinates when it comes to you it make another person the supernatural one you are a physical man but the word of God forms another person in you amen and that word of God and that body that it forms that's the one God will come and Rapture that is why here it says Bible what would you say when you see the son of man goes back where he was before where was the son of man he was in the bosom of the father no one who has ever seen God except the son because the sun is in the bosom of so now in consoling you the family is that now your brother or your loved one he not in bondage wherever he is no he's in is in a better place he received the word that word forms him remember the man that is standing before you now you callana actually the real man is the one that is inside this one is aging he got Silver Lining you see he cannot go to heaven are we together so we've got elderly people here elderly fathers elderly mothers you cannot find a go go in heaven or an old man a very sick man in heaven it's just now that the inner part the inner man is not a is not an old man are we together so now in closing because I was giv this 45 minutes I'm left with 2 minutes in closing is this that now I quoted the scripture and left it you need to know where the place of worship is Right amen you missed the place of worship you God sent John the Baptist and they left everybody and followed John the bapti and when the ministry changes John the Baptist appointed Christ they left Christ I mean they left John and those that followed Christ he didn't preach to them no no he just said follow me and Peter followed him uh the sons of zebede they were with their father he just said follow me they left their father and follow because now a deep call it unto a deep he was not calling the the physical men he was calling the men inside there is somebody inside of you either he comes from eternity look the Bible says the angels that kept not their first estate God has changed them prepared a lake of fire those are the Angels that kept not their FA and the people that could not keep their first AC God created you for what reason why did God create you so that you should serve him right amen and in serving him then he becomes happy and if you don't serve him then God doesn't know you he doesn't know you because you don't know him you don't know each other but if you know that this is my God you surrender yourself and when you surrender yourself then you are baptized in his name and then when you baptized in his when the word of God preaches finds a place in your one verse one verse one verse John 8 verse 37 amen amen may you please read it for us in Sp so that everyone can hear it all right John 8 verse 37 I know that you are Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word had no in you look the word of God the word had no place in you amen amen so that it can word must find place in you and then when the word comes and dwell in you what does it do to you that's where now it germinates when this word germinates it's that Spirit which we call a quickening spirit First Corinthians chapter 15:45 when the word comes into you it finds a place and it relax you don't have to struggle no the word itself do the word but if it can't find Place want to suffer read it read it verse verse 45 1545 First Corinthians all right 1 Corinthians chter 15 ver 45 the last is the quickening spirit who is the last Adam it's Christ Christ is a quickening spirit that person that germinates in you it's called Christ so when Christ comes he come and and and what you call and and take Christ what we call a Rapture maybe some other people says what is this Rapture I'm closing the Rapture is this you are all waiting for the coming of the Lord Coming For What to come and fetch you right come and fetch you so now the Bible says you're are going to meet him in the sky not here in other ways you must change and go up to the sky you don't become a bed no you are yourself you become Christ Christ will be coming you will be going now can you go to somebody that you don't know can he come to somebody that he doesn't know may the Lord bless [Applause] you sorry bless you
