[4:57] mountains and
[5:00] H
[5:05] trees and
[5:12] since natural types the
[5:20] spiritual also blessed us with the
[5:24] spiritual
[5:27] things as we tell to Revelation 3:
[5:35] 20 just to to
[5:38] continue today we shall give it another
[5:45] title H the contact
[5:51] center revelation
[5:58] 3yp
[6:13] for and John chapter 3 14
[6:28] verse
[6:30] [Music]
[6:40] you may be
[6:46] seated
[6:50] okay
[6:54] Genesis
[6:56] Genesis 3 20
[7:00] years and Adam called his wife name Eve
[7:02] Eve that's correct all right well it's
[7:06] in line with what we talking about
[7:08] Christ in the
[7:13] [Music]
[7:14] church so Christ also called
[7:19] gave the wife the name
[7:24] [Music]
[7:26] Christ now let's go back to the contact
[7:35] center now we read yesterday of the
[7:38] three
[7:42] Thrones the first one being in
[7:46] heaven the second one in
[7:50] chist the third one
[7:54] in all three
[7:58] together and that we have seen how he
[8:01] came
[8:05] down to the third
[8:10] throne and now we will look into the
[8:14] subject because man is God's Center
[8:24] Point
[8:28] Hallelujah CER Point
[8:38] that's yeah contact center the contact
[8:42] center of God
[8:49] okay okay we read in the
[8:53] Bible how God made the
[8:58] things and brought them to
[9:01] Adam and Adam gave them
[9:06] names so every time God makes a thing he
[9:10] brings it to
[9:13] [Music]
[9:14] men because men is the other part
[9:20] contact part of
[9:28] God man holds the other
[9:36] contract now he is contracted to
[9:41] God that's why when he was
[9:46] coming to
[9:50] Abraham in investigation
[9:52] [Music]
[9:58] of so he
[10:00] said I I shall not hide from
[10:05] Abraham the that
[10:07] [Music]
[10:15] IAM
[10:17] Moses and the other
[10:20] prophets they they saw things
[10:25] own they could see the four quarters
[10:31] God could do nothing without first
[10:34] making a
[10:37] [Music]
[10:39] contact when he is coming to us he has
[10:42] to make a contact with a
[10:45] [Music]
[10:48] man when he was going to destroy the
[10:52] worldall with fls he made a contact with
[10:55] a
[10:58] man
[11:03] so if you read down the
[11:06] Bible you realize that God makes a
[11:12] [Music]
[11:14] contact
[11:15] okay now H let's take to this
[11:21] again
[11:23] and
[11:25] um I'm going to read some few things
[11:28] again
[11:31] now today we read this scripture where
[11:33] it says at that day you shall
[11:40] know that I am in the
[11:44] father and the father and you in
[11:50] me and I in
[11:54] you all right
[11:57] now I will read it here in the book
[12:01] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[12:03] Page
[12:09] 6 refering to that scripture that
[12:16] day you
[12:19] shall so that's we know
[12:23] today because he says you shall
[12:26] know because if you don't
[12:29] no the Bible
[12:32] say God said my
[12:36] people because of the of
[12:40] knowled because if you don't
[12:44] know you depend on something
[12:48] else whether it's right that is right or
[12:53] wrong because you don't
[12:56] know but the day you
[12:59] know you don't need
[13:02] somebody to inter you what you
[13:12] know the
[13:16] scure that
[13:19] day and he continues to say that is
[13:27] this
[13:32] at
[13:35] day youing to the
[13:37] [Music]
[13:39] Jews to
[13:42] feel and and so
[13:46] forth that
[13:49] day you shall
[13:51] know and the prophet
[13:54] says it is this
[13:57] day amen amen amen and when the
[14:02] Revelation is made
[14:06] [Music]
[14:07] known you will know when the Revelation
[14:10] is made
[14:18] known and he
[14:21] says
[14:22] and then you are see that is the
[14:25] threefold
[14:27] manifestation
[14:32] now the threefold
[14:37] [Music]
[14:38] manifestation he was talking about
[14:41] this he was talking about
[14:46] this I'll do it the way I did it one
[14:52] day so we have a three
[14:56] [Music]
[14:57] manifestation
[14:59] at that day you shall know
[15:03] that I am in the
[15:14] father we are learning French now from
[15:17] South
[15:23] Africa yeah yeah then and again he
[15:30] says and that day you shall know
[15:34] that then you
[15:40] [Music]
[15:41] in
[15:44] right you in
[15:47] me and the third now we
[15:51] are 1 2
[15:55] 3 the third is I
[15:59] in
[16:06] [Music]
[16:14] you okay in the
[16:18] father you you in
[16:21] [Music]
[16:22] me and I in
[16:26] you so it's one thing
[16:31] amen and because the Bible
[16:36] says the all and
[16:42] [Music]
[16:44] all so the prophet calls it a
[16:52] threefold when the Revelation comes
[16:56] forth then I in
[17:00] you
[17:05] that's now what it
[17:11] means in the
[17:14] beginning was the
[17:16] word and the word in
[17:20] God the word was with
[17:23] God so the word was a mind in God
[17:30] then he came like we've seen
[17:34] yesterday that God is a
[17:38] spirit then he came down into the form
[17:42] of the
[17:50] [Music]
[17:57] Lo okay come
[18:01] down anden
[18:05] Hallelujah so so it gives you the third

[18:15] center when he is in
[18:22] you
[18:26] a that is
[18:31] destination all this
[18:33] time God was coming to
[18:37] men even in theard of
[18:40] Eden the Bible says they had his
[18:45] voice walking in the
[18:48] garden because all this time he was
[18:51] coming to his
[18:54] place and I will read again
[18:59] [Music]

[19:07] prophet now today we have seen we have

[23:26] in
[23:29] if you say I got Revelation from
[23:34] God Revelation is that word in
[23:39] flesh
[23:40] Revelation is the word in a
[23:46] man that is
[23:48] ration as we said yesterday
[23:52] [Music]
[23:53] reation
[23:56] Revelation is not just it's not in the
[23:59] book Revelation is in a
[24:04] man living
[24:09] Revelation it makes you a
[24:15] revelation you can't separate
[24:18] it no Christ in
[24:21] you makes you the complete
[24:26] revelation
[24:28] he says this is what God is trying to
[24:34] do to show
[24:37] you amen now H we look at another one
[24:45] again as now he makes you a
[24:51] revelation I will read page 64
[24:56] again as we are just going for few
[24:59] minutes to continue where we left
[25:06] yesterday now I'm going back to that
[25:13] scripture God and man was
[25:17] one there and God and man is one
[25:22] [Music]
[25:24] here
[25:25] amen you see that that's why standing in
[25:30] the
[25:32] Gap we need to ask our
[25:37] [Music]
[25:39] question
[25:41] because it was God
[25:45] andam and Adam left his
[25:50] post so he
[25:54] [Music]
[25:55] left no
[26:01] okay
[26:12] now all
[26:15] right I will
[26:17] say I will use the same CLE
[26:23] okay we looking at God
[26:27] [Music]
[26:36] [Music]
[26:43] and
[26:46] again when he left the place and God
[26:50] said where are
[26:54] you because he left again
[27:00] so because it was a between and
[27:06] God now when because of sin left
[27:11] Place God
[27:13] came
[27:16] out where are
[27:19] you because he was not in
[27:25] place then it cost God
[27:29] to become the
[27:32] second in order to bring
[27:35] [Music]
[27:38] back
[27:40] again that is what we call
[27:46] [Music]
[27:51] restoration
[27:53] said came with a message standing in the
[28:03] because he is the seventh
[28:06] [Music]
[28:08] angel now the seventh angel messenger is
[28:11] the last
[28:16] [Music]
[28:21] Messenger as we look at John the
[28:26] Baptist as a
[28:29] forun he stood in the
[28:32] G between the old and the New
[28:37] Testament to introduce the Messiah to
[28:40] the
[28:42] Jews the Old
[28:46] Testament and now we are in the New
[28:49] [Music]
[28:53] Testament between the church ages and
[28:56] the
[29:00] the Bible the New
[29:07] Testament amen or Time and
[29:13] [Music]
[29:19] Eternity amen
[29:21] because
[29:23] say God
[29:26] came
[29:28] down the
[29:30] G he took the body of
[29:34] time so he shed his
[29:38] blood to redeem this
[29:42] [Music]
[29:43] G so that he can bring back
[29:48] man to his original
[29:51] [Music]
[29:53] post amen and he did that with brother
[30:00] coming
[30:03] to
[30:05] now in
[30:08] Eden with
[30:12] Adam
[30:19] [Music]
[30:20] wasat God and his
[30:26] son
[30:28] and the Book of
[30:31] Luke chapter
[30:34] 3 I don't know
[30:37] 38 it tell you that Adam was the son of
[30:44] [Music]
[30:47] God
[30:48] Amen
[30:50] okay let me read for you
[30:54] Adam was the son of God
[30:59] so he didn't need a
[31:03] [Music]
[31:05] mediator there was nothing between
[31:13] [Music]
[31:21] and but after the
[31:25] sin then God brought in a
[31:34] mediator
[31:35] until the end of
[31:39] [Music]
[31:42] redemption
[31:44] right so I'm trying to read to you uh
[31:49] Luke 3:
[31:56] 38
[31:57] coming down of
[32:01] theology now here it says who was the
[32:04] son of Enos verse 38 Luke 3: 38 who was
[32:10] the son of Enos
[32:13] son
[32:15] son son of
[32:19] God soam was the son of not a not a son
[32:25] the Son of God hallelujah
[32:31] then he
[32:32] fall he left the
[32:35] poost amen so that's why
[32:39] God came down the seven
[32:46] steps he established seven steps for
[32:53] us
[32:55] okay now let
[32:57] let's come here
[33:00] again now the prophet
[33:03] says God and man is now one
[33:08] [Music]
[33:12] here then he
[33:14] says he God don't just
[33:19] change it's God
[33:23] in that's his manifestation
[33:30] you can't call it
[33:32] manifestation until it is
[33:39] God that's then when it is
[33:45] manifestation you can't call it a
[33:47] revelation until God is
[33:52] in say
[33:55] it's you can't call it a fulfillment
[33:59] until that way is made
[34:03] flesh that's when it's called
[34:07] fulfillment before that it's not
[34:11] fulfillment because it's not yet in
[34:15] [Music]
[34:17] flesh
[34:19] all now I'll read something here now
[34:22] when you reach the
[34:25] heart
[34:28] amen because we were looking
[34:31] yesterday of how the seventh seal
[34:43] open open the
[34:47] [Music]
[34:49] seals that's why it was
[34:52] Sil because it's the one that open the
[34:55] SE
[35:00] amen
[35:01] now we let's go down this
[35:06] way now I will read from the book the
[35:10] unity of one God in the one
[35:17] church because it also tells me
[35:21] that H when God comes to man he comes
[35:28] [Music]
[35:31] their now we have two things
[35:37] here we have what we call
[35:42] men and we have what we call the
[35:49] [Music]
[35:51] heart separates
[35:54] them he
[35:55] says your soul in your
[36:00] heart another
[36:12] man so we read that
[36:15] yesterday the throne the third Throne is
[36:19] in your
[36:22] soul it has got nothing to do with this
[36:29] this is controlled
[36:32] [Music]
[36:34] by
[36:36] says Flesh and Blood shall not inherit
[36:39] the kingdom
[36:42] [Music]
[36:49] of
[36:51] say there is another
[36:55] man
[36:57] and he says that man went to the third
[37:04] heaven and brother tells that that was
[37:07] that
[37:10] Paul the inward part of
[37:15] Paul went to the
[37:20] [Music]
[37:23] third this one is natural
[37:27] he has only five
[37:31] senses that's why I can say to
[37:36] you I live in South Africa I live in
[37:41] South
[37:43] Africa my house is
[37:45] there but will you believe me if I say
[37:48] to you I can see my house right while
[37:51] standing
[37:55] here
[38:00] you don't
[38:06] believe and if if you don't have a
[38:08] vision of your
[38:12] house afraid you are going to get lost
[38:14] when you
[38:19] leave because your house is programmed
[38:23] in you am am now am you must take me to
[38:28] your house because it's not programmed
[38:30] in
[38:36] me if it's my first time to go to your
[38:41] house I need somebody to me
[38:46] there noted in
[38:49] [Music]
[38:51] me
[38:54] somebody can go to your house
[38:57] because programmed in
[38:59] him that's how we are going to
[39:05] heaven you are going to
[39:08] go something that ised in
[39:12] you you know when Jesus was coming to
[39:16] John the Bible says John saw
[39:21] Jesus comingto
[39:23] him because that thing was programmed
[39:39] [Music]
[39:43] she said to
[39:44] Jesus I believe you are a
[39:47] [Music]
[39:48] prophet and she to tell the
[39:55] people
[39:59] J
