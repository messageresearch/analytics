[52:19] [Music]
[52:21] you okay we are at the funeral here
[52:28] of our
[52:31] sister of which I believe all of us
[52:35] knows him knows
[52:40] her
[52:42] yes we've heard some testimonies about
[52:48] her which is is
[52:51] wonderful let's that's why I'm reading
[52:54] here about our Lord Jesus Christ
[52:59] because our Lord Jesus
[53:04] Christ he came
[53:07] here not to show
[53:09] [Music]
[53:11] off but he was here to fulfill the
[53:18] we and manifest the
[53:21] We There were
[53:24] prophecies about him
[53:28] uh prophets like
[53:31] Isaiah they said virgin
[53:36] shall then and bear a
[53:40] son now he was bringing that testimony
[53:43] that I am that
[53:47] son and Isaiah
[53:51] said
[53:53] uh and his name Shall be Called
[53:55] wonderful
[54:01] comfor so he was comforting
[54:06] people then Isaiah
[54:09] said was the Everlasting
[54:14] father are we together so now he came to
[54:17] fulfill all
[54:20] those so now each and every one of
[54:24] us that we are
[54:28] here uh the Bible
[54:31] says uh in the book of Colossians
[54:36] one you read verse
[54:40] 16 it says by all things were created by
[54:45] Him
[54:48] all big and small
[54:52] things visible and
[54:58] now when he created those
[55:01] things he created even
[55:05] kingdoms and
[55:08] principalities he created them for
[55:12] himself so now we are all
[55:16] here because we created by
[55:20] him and then actually we're here to
[55:23] manifest
[55:27] uh the
[55:29] prophecies each and every one of
[55:32] us there is a
[55:35] prophecy that is directed to
[55:39] him now our Lord Jesus
[55:43] Christ one
[55:46] day he he took the Bible of that time
[55:50] which was called a
[55:53] scroll and open it
[55:56] and find where the Bible speaks about
[56:02] him then he read it and then he said to
[56:07] them this day the scripture is
[56:12] fulfilled now he was said this
[56:15] scripture is talking about
[56:19] me now the Bible
[56:21] says they look at
[56:24] him they said
[56:27] is this not the son of John and
[56:33] Mary and whose brothers we
[56:39] know so
[56:42] now when you manifest the
[56:45] We There is a natural
[56:48] birth from your
[56:51] parents there's a supernatural bed
[56:57] that that that comes from
[57:00] eternity now we read here verse
[57:04] 47 ver 47 46 verse 46 says and when
[57:09] Jesus had cried with a loud
[57:14] voice he said
[57:17] father into thy hands I command my
[57:24] spirit the day was
[57:28] baptized a spirit descended upon
[57:34] him a spirit descended upon
[57:40] him and when he was in the
[57:43] cross he said I command the
[57:47] spirit back to
[57:50] you now we know that
[57:53] now we are body
[57:56] we are Spirit we are
[57:59] [Music]
[58:00] souls and then when time
[58:05] comes that these three
[58:08] separates each and everyone take it own
[58:14] Journey so now the Bible
[58:19] says those that come from
[58:22] eternity they will go back to Eternity
[58:28] are we
[58:29] together
[58:31] because they were processed from the
[58:34] heart of
[58:37] God and when they were processed From
[58:39] The Heart Of
[58:42] God which means they come from the soul
[58:45] of
[58:47] God so now they become the minor
[58:53] gods they become the
[58:58] God one
[59:01] day they said to our Lord Jesus
[59:06] Christ you've been beating about the
[59:10] bush tell us exactly who you
[59:15] are he said I told
[59:18] you and you didn't
[59:21] [Music]
[59:22] believe and then he even said to them
[59:26] of all the things that I've
[59:30] done and you want to Stone
[59:33] me which
[59:36] one just show me those
[59:39] things they said no you did
[59:43] Miracles we don't Stone you for
[59:46] that you did good things you walk upon
[59:49] the sea multiplied bread you ra the dead
[59:55] for that we don't Stone
[59:58] you but the reason that we should Stone
[1:00:02] you you are a human
[1:00:05] being and you make yourself
[1:00:08] God now what we should
[1:00:11] remember is that as long as you haven't
[1:00:15] reached
[1:00:16] [Music]
[1:00:18] that
[1:00:21] Dimension where you will reflect God
[1:00:27] then you are not that that
[1:00:31] ready it must come a
[1:00:34] time where people would
[1:00:36] say you are a human being and you make
[1:00:40] yourself
[1:00:43] called because they'll be seeing the god
[1:00:47] that is in
[1:00:49] you but with no
[1:00:52] understanding that a human being can be
[1:00:57] God
[1:00:59] right now he said he gave back the
[1:01:04] spirit when you you you you
[1:01:10] depart you gave back the spirit where it
[1:01:13] comes
[1:01:14] from and the Soul goes back where it
[1:01:17] comes
[1:01:18] from the body goes back where it comes
[1:01:22] from now the Bible says Flesh and Blood
[1:01:27] shall not inherit the kingdom
[1:01:31] of okay I want us to
[1:01:36] continue so now when he he gave
[1:01:42] back he says when the Centurion saw what
[1:01:45] was
[1:01:48] done he glorified
[1:01:51] God right amen saying certainly this was
[1:01:55] a ious
[1:01:58] man when he saw him
[1:02:02] dying giving the ghost
[1:02:05] out now let's read
[1:02:14] Matthew remember we are here on
[1:02:19] Earth just to manifest the word of
[1:02:23] God are we are we together amen apart
[1:02:26] from
[1:02:27] that there's nothing that we are here
[1:02:30] for we are just
[1:02:33] temporary just to
[1:02:37] manifest that what the prophetes
[1:02:42] says the Bible
[1:02:45] says the nature is
[1:02:48] groing gring for
[1:02:52] what gring for the manifestations
[1:02:58] of the sons of
[1:03:01] God because the Son of God
[1:03:06] Adam was in
[1:03:09] charge was in control of the
[1:03:12] nature was in control of all the
[1:03:15] creatures
[1:03:16] of he would say to that mountain
[1:03:19] move who said to that
[1:03:22] River this
[1:03:24] direction he will call things into
[1:03:29] existence now in our
[1:03:32] time the Bible says our Lord will come
[1:03:36] as a thief in the
[1:03:41] night he said he will
[1:03:43] come as a thief in the
[1:03:47] night right there is
[1:03:50] coming and
[1:03:53] appearing it doesn't say he will appear
[1:03:55] as a thief
[1:03:57] in he will come as a thief in
[1:04:03] the what if I say to
[1:04:06] you he has already he has already
[1:04:10] came in the form of the revealed
[1:04:16] word because when the word is revealed
[1:04:19] to
[1:04:21] you the Bible
[1:04:24] says in the book of First
[1:04:27] John 3
[1:04:31] ver9 it says a child of God does not
[1:04:36] sin because the SE the seed of
[1:04:40] God remains in
[1:04:42] him the seed of
[1:04:45] God remains in
[1:04:47] him what is the seed of God the seed of
[1:04:51] God is the word of
[1:04:53] God and when word of God
[1:04:56] is in the child of
[1:04:58] God then it
[1:05:01] germinates the word of God by the way
[1:05:04] the Bible says in the beginning was the
[1:05:08] W the W was with God the Word was
[1:05:13] God are we together the Word was
[1:05:18] God right now if the word of God is a
[1:05:24] seed then when it finds a
[1:05:28] place because in uh John chapter
[1:05:35] 8 verse
[1:05:37] 37 our lord said to the
[1:05:40] phes you want to kill
[1:05:43] me or you said you are a Seed of
[1:05:47] Abraham but you want to kill me because
[1:05:50] my words cannot find a place in you
[1:05:58] so now when you are a
[1:06:00] Believer you believe the word of God
[1:06:03] When You Believe in the word of God then
[1:06:06] when it reaches
[1:06:08] you then it start
[1:06:11] germinating building a watch building
[1:06:14] another
[1:06:16] body which will never
[1:06:18] die building another
[1:06:21] Bo where in your heart
[1:06:26] right amen and then when it builds that
[1:06:28] body and that body
[1:06:31] grows until it becomes
[1:06:34] Christ you must know now that Christ is
[1:06:37] the Son of God and Jesus is the son of
[1:06:41] God now
[1:06:44] Christ Jesus is is a place where the
[1:06:50] word which is
[1:06:52] christs in
[1:06:55] the difference between Jesus and Christ
[1:07:00] is that Jesus is a body Christ is a
[1:07:08] supernatural that was in that body and
[1:07:12] when Jesus
[1:07:14] said I and my father he was referring to
[1:07:17] the word
[1:07:20] that he was referring to Christ the way
[1:07:25] together now the word of God you cannot
[1:07:29] see it with your
[1:07:31] naked God is a spirit John
[1:07:36] 4234
[1:07:39] Spirit those that worship Him shall
[1:07:42] worship Him in truth and in
[1:07:46] spirit now if the word of God you cannot
[1:07:50] see it with your
[1:07:52] negative then God when he
[1:07:56] descend when he processed
[1:07:59] himself he become the
[1:08:01] logos that Pillar of
[1:08:04] Fire that Moses
[1:08:06] saw in the burning
[1:08:09] bush that was nothing else but the angel
[1:08:13] of the
[1:08:15] Lord now where am I going
[1:08:18] to I'm trying to say to
[1:08:21] you
[1:08:23] that now
[1:08:26] when somebody
[1:08:28] depart it all depends on what was in
[1:08:34] him are we
[1:08:36] together because uh when you
[1:08:40] separate when these three things
[1:08:43] separate each and everyone takes his own
[1:08:49] Direction the spirit goes back to
[1:08:52] God the soul goes back to
[1:08:56] uh Under The
[1:09:00] Altar and the body goes to the
[1:09:07] ground amen now it all
[1:09:12] depends that's what the scripture
[1:09:15] says it all
[1:09:17] depend that now when you were here on
[1:09:21] Earth what was your relationship with
[1:09:24] God
[1:09:28] let's let's analyze it very
[1:09:33] softly the Bible
[1:09:36] says in the Book of
[1:09:39] Matthew
[1:09:42] 25 there were 10
[1:09:45] virgins they were waiting for the
[1:09:51] coming of the groom
[1:09:56] are we
[1:09:57] together some
[1:10:01] had and some had no
[1:10:05] oil what does that oil
[1:10:10] T the Holy Ghost what is the Holy
[1:10:15] Ghost let me tell you what is the Holy
[1:10:18] Ghost the Holy Ghost is not speaking in
[1:10:23] Tong the Holy Ghost is not singing in
[1:10:27] town let me tell you
[1:10:30] what the Bible
[1:10:33] says in the book of Ephesians chapter
[1:10:37] 1 verse
[1:10:40] 17 say the
[1:10:43] Lord will give you a
[1:10:47] spirit and that
[1:10:49] spirit will give you an knowledge and
[1:10:53] understanding
[1:10:56] of who he
[1:10:57] is can I repeat and in the Book of John
[1:11:02] 16 John verse 12 verse 12 it says
[1:11:07] now I will give you the
[1:11:10] comforter he will take from
[1:11:13] me to
[1:11:16] you and you will never understand this
[1:11:20] book when you read you read the words
[1:11:24] that are written here
[1:11:27] but you need a
[1:11:28] spirit that will
[1:11:31] come and interpret what you've been
[1:11:34] reading that's what we call the Holy
[1:11:38] Ghost apart from that then when you have
[1:11:42] that
[1:11:43] anointing it's just to to please
[1:11:46] yourself but the real Holy Ghost the one
[1:11:50] that needs to that you should interpret
[1:11:53] them now they five 5
[1:11:57] 10 waiting for
[1:12:01] coming some have oil some have
[1:12:05] known now out of this
[1:12:08] 10 who's going to a
[1:12:12] judgment because he says they were
[1:12:18] virgins all of them right you must know
[1:12:23] that in the judgment
[1:12:25] the Bible says the Lord will divide
[1:12:32] people like a a
[1:12:35] Shepherd
[1:12:36] separating sheep from
[1:12:40] goat now now my way of
[1:12:44] preaching I Don't Preach for somebody
[1:12:47] that is going to the
[1:12:50] Judgment right I'll tell you why let's
[1:12:54] read the
[1:12:56] Matthew 202 uh Matthew chapter 20:
[1:13:01] 20 then came to him the mother of
[1:13:05] zebedee's children with her sons
[1:13:08] worshiping him and Desiring a certain
[1:13:11] thing of him right this
[1:13:15] woman came to our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:13:18] Bible says she desire a certain
[1:13:23] thing then
[1:13:26] and he said unto her what Willl thou she
[1:13:30] said unto him grant that this my two
[1:13:33] sons May sit the one on thy right hand
[1:13:38] and the other on the left in thy kingdom
[1:13:41] you see it's a good
[1:13:43] thing the mother brings his two
[1:13:47] sons say
[1:13:49] Lord this is my
[1:13:52] desire that these two sons of mine
[1:13:56] one should be on the
[1:13:58] right on your
[1:14:00] left in your
[1:14:03] kingdom which is
[1:14:06] good then let's jump and go to verse
[1:14:10] 22
[1:14:11] 22 but Jesus answered and said he know
[1:14:15] not what he
[1:14:17] ask are you able to drink of the cup
[1:14:20] that I shall drink of and to be baptized
[1:14:24] with the baptism that I am baptized with
[1:14:27] they said unto him we are
[1:14:30] able and he said unto them he shall
[1:14:33] drink indeed of my cup and be baptized
[1:14:36] with the baptism that I am baptized with
[1:14:39] yes but to sit on my right hand and on
[1:14:42] my left is not mine to give but it shall
[1:14:46] be given to them for whom it is prepared
[1:14:49] of my father
[1:14:53] says always will Jesus will talk about
[1:14:56] his
[1:14:59] father and then there was a
[1:15:03] time
[1:15:05] where he was asked and said no show us
[1:15:08] the
[1:15:11] father and then he said the father is in
[1:15:15] me now here when he
[1:15:20] says uh but to sit on my right hand
[1:15:25] and on my left is not
[1:15:29] mine to give but it shall be given to
[1:15:34] them for whom it is prepared of my
[1:15:39] father when he says for whom it is
[1:15:42] prepared of my
[1:15:44] father it simply
[1:15:47] means that
[1:15:50] now he is uh processed from the father
[1:15:54] yes
[1:15:58] now when is processed from
[1:16:01] the all those are
[1:16:06] processed it will the father that
[1:16:09] knows but now he says
[1:16:12] himself says the father is in
[1:16:16] me you remember John John 42
[1:16:21] 142 say at that
[1:16:23] day shall
[1:16:26] know that I am in the
[1:16:28] father you in me and I in
[1:16:32] you in other words he says depends on
[1:16:36] the
[1:16:39] predestination see how did God
[1:16:41] predestinate
[1:16:43] you now you cannot be
[1:16:47] predestinated and then go to the
[1:16:51] Judgment no you cannot go to the the
[1:16:54] Bible says the
[1:16:56] Saints will judge the
[1:17:00] nations are we are we together so that's
[1:17:03] why he says
[1:17:04] now you can drink you can be
[1:17:08] baptized in other words he say it
[1:17:11] started by
[1:17:13] saying uh would you be would you be
[1:17:16] would you be able to be baptized as I
[1:17:21] am they said yes okay find it now to
[1:17:26] choose a
[1:17:28] position it's a
[1:17:31] predestination it comes from the father
[1:17:34] now when somebody
[1:17:36] departs some
[1:17:38] people they
[1:17:40] depart and go to The Fifth
[1:17:44] Dimension Fifth Dimension is
[1:17:47] H they waiting for the
[1:17:50] judgment and when they wait for judgment
[1:17:53] then they are inment
[1:17:56] some when they die or they depart they
[1:18:01] go to another
[1:18:02] dimension which is the sixth
[1:18:05] Dimension where there is not
[1:18:07] de remember the Bible in the book of
[1:18:11] First
[1:18:14] Corinthians chapter 15 chapter 15 if you
[1:18:17] read from the the 35th
[1:18:20] verse it goes to a point
[1:18:23] where speaks about the different
[1:18:28] bodies it speaks about body Celestial
[1:18:31] body
[1:18:34] terral so now he says we are wearing
[1:18:36] this
[1:18:37] body this body is
[1:18:40] terrestrial but when we we we
[1:18:42] depart we wear
[1:18:45] another which is
[1:18:47] Celestial to weight with that
[1:18:50] body in the celestial
[1:18:53] body after the in heaven we'll be having
[1:18:57] a
[1:18:59] glorified are we together so this is a
[1:19:03] temporary
[1:19:04] Bo now each and every one of us will
[1:19:08] take a direction the most important
[1:19:12] part is that now when you take a
[1:19:16] direction you must take the right
[1:19:19] direction right
[1:19:22] now Luke Paul Paul was the
[1:19:28] messenger of the Church of
[1:19:32] Ephesians and Paul set up a
[1:19:36] foundation and said if there's anybody
[1:19:38] that
[1:19:40] comes and build another
[1:19:43] Foundation even if it can be an
[1:19:47] angel let him be
[1:19:52] Aur now
[1:19:55] because uh time is tight let me not read
[1:20:00] the bible let me
[1:20:02] speak
[1:20:04] because I'm conscious of
[1:20:06] time this is what happened
[1:20:09] then when Jesus
[1:20:11] Christ
[1:20:14] departed then uh the book of
[1:20:20] Peter chapter 3 and verse 18 and 19
[1:20:25] 3: 18 19 it
[1:20:27] says his
[1:20:30] soul went to those
[1:20:35] Souls that repented
[1:20:38] not he went to
[1:20:42] preach he went to
[1:20:44] H to
[1:20:47] preach and then after
[1:20:49] preaching then he went to
[1:20:52] Paradise right you know the story of
[1:20:55] divas and the rich
[1:20:59] man Lazaro I mean Lazaro and div
[1:21:05] sorry and then Lazaro was in the chest
[1:21:07] of
[1:21:10] Abraham enjoying
[1:21:12] himself Divas was in
[1:21:16] hell and then he wanted water to quench
[1:21:20] his
[1:21:23] tongue different
[1:21:26] that one was with
[1:21:30] Abraham remember that
[1:21:32] Abraham could not go to the sixth
[1:21:36] Dimension and even Isaac and even Joseph
[1:21:40] and all of
[1:21:42] themob because they were not cleansed by
[1:21:46] the blood of
[1:21:48] God of
[1:21:52] Jesus he had to die
[1:21:56] first so that their sins could be
[1:22:00] washed but they were
[1:22:04] covered by the blood of the
[1:22:08] animals then from
[1:22:11] Hell Revelation 1
[1:22:14] verse 1 verse he
[1:22:17] says I am the one that was
[1:22:21] dead now I am alive
[1:22:24] exactly then I have the
[1:22:28] keys of
[1:22:31] death and
[1:22:34] hell are we together death and
[1:22:38] hell then with those
[1:22:41] keys then he went to
[1:22:46] paradise and
[1:22:48] released those that were in
[1:22:51] paradise and then when he released them
[1:22:55] then he took them you I think you have
[1:22:58] read
[1:22:59] also the book of
[1:23:04] Psalm psms I think is chapter 7 ver or
[1:23:09] chapter 24:7 can you read it for us my
[1:23:12] brother even if I said I don't want to
[1:23:15] read it and qu it but
[1:23:17] 24:7 Psalms
[1:23:20] 24:7 so I'll tell you why I'm reading
[1:23:23] this
[1:23:26] he took them out of
[1:23:29] paradise now it's very nice when you you
[1:23:32] you you you you when somebody has
[1:23:36] departed and people have got an
[1:23:41] understanding but it becomes a crucial
[1:23:45] matter when somebody
[1:23:48] departed and people don't understand
[1:23:58] she's going to represent us that is a
[1:24:00] pitiful
[1:24:02] moment are we together all right I'll
[1:24:05] explain that but he went to
[1:24:09] hell he took the
[1:24:11] keys from the Devil the devil was in
[1:24:17] charge of death and hell and even
[1:24:22] grave if you read the book book of
[1:24:26] Hebrews
[1:24:28] uh I think it's chapter
[1:24:31] two 2 verse 14 don't open it don't open
[1:24:35] it he says now there were
[1:24:39] people that were afraid of
[1:24:42] death so what did Jesus do he became a
[1:24:47] human
[1:24:48] being so that he should share his
[1:24:52] blood and relieve those
[1:24:54] people who had the fear of
[1:24:57] death who was the slave of
[1:25:02] death so now he went to
[1:25:04] hell took those the devil was the
[1:25:08] boss because he had the keys you
[1:25:12] remember when he was with Peter when he
[1:25:16] Peter and ask him who who do people say
[1:25:21] that I the son of man am
[1:25:26] then Peter said thou are the Christ the
[1:25:30] son of the Living God that was what we
[1:25:33] call a
[1:25:34] revelation that's what our Lord
[1:25:37] wanted he wanted to
[1:25:40] know whether people they understand
[1:25:44] is or it's just people that want
[1:25:48] breed see
[1:25:50] Miracles see him walking upon the sea
[1:25:53] they don't
[1:25:54] understand who he was so Peter
[1:25:58] said
[1:26:00] remember our
[1:26:02] Lord uh had some
[1:26:07] dispensation that's what kills people
[1:26:10] today
[1:26:13] Moses uh
[1:26:15] dispensation was to take the children of
[1:26:18] Israel of
[1:26:22] Egypt and then when he reached the
[1:26:25] SE the ministry
[1:26:28] changed and he went to the
[1:26:31] desert when he reached River
[1:26:34] Jordan his ministry was
[1:26:37] finished and
[1:26:39] Joshua took over with another
[1:26:43] Minister we are we together and let them
[1:26:46] cross
[1:26:48] over then after crossing over he gave
[1:26:51] them their
[1:26:53] inheritance amen are we together amen
[1:26:56] now
[1:26:57] we
[1:26:59] always become
[1:27:01] stagnant and stay one
[1:27:04] place our
[1:27:06] ministry is not changing with the
[1:27:11] dispensation is not changing with the
[1:27:13] relevant
[1:27:16] Ministry are we together now our Lord
[1:27:20] Jesus Christ after doing all the
[1:27:22] Miracles
[1:27:24] he said who do people
[1:27:27] say I the son of man am now that was the
[1:27:31] changing of the
[1:27:32] ministry immediately Peter
[1:27:35] said thou are the Christ the son of the
[1:27:39] Living God then he say that's it flesh
[1:27:42] and blood not revealed
[1:27:45] that
[1:27:48] means are we together then I can change
[1:27:51] my
[1:27:52] Ministry are we together
[1:27:54] then what did he do from that day on he
[1:27:59] said I will go to
[1:28:00] Jerusalem I'll be
[1:28:02] arrested and I will resurrect on the
[1:28:06] thir then Peter said Over My Dead Bo he
[1:28:11] said get deep behind me you
[1:28:14] Dev because you don't want the ministry
[1:28:16] to
[1:28:18] change are we
[1:28:21] together then the ministry changed
[1:28:25] that's what he was
[1:28:26] preaching then when he was about to be
[1:28:30] arrested he said this
[1:28:33] evening you
[1:28:35] people you you're going to be
[1:28:40] ashamed because I'm going to be arrested
[1:28:43] this this
[1:28:46] evening then Peter said
[1:28:50] never and
[1:28:52] then it's when he said to
[1:28:55] him before the coke could crow the crow
[1:29:01] could the can craw can
[1:29:04] craw yeah you know
[1:29:10] it he said you will deny me three
[1:29:13] times amen then Peter said never he even
[1:29:20] influenced all the
[1:29:22] disciples were against
[1:29:25] Jesus concerning
[1:29:28] that are we together now the ministry
[1:29:33] changes and when the ministry
[1:29:36] changes and
[1:29:38] people remain with the old Stant
[1:29:42] Ministry and then when they remain with
[1:29:44] that old Stant
[1:29:47] Ministry they they miss their
[1:29:51] inheritance because because josua
[1:29:55] show them their
[1:29:57] inheritance Reuben's
[1:30:02] your and with our
[1:30:05] ministry we are Gentiles we are not
[1:30:09] Jews we have our own
[1:30:11] Ministry which differs from the
[1:30:15] Jew our ministry started from
[1:30:20] Paul it went off started from Ephesians
[1:30:24] Church you read it in the
[1:30:26] Bible speak about
[1:30:33] Ephesus sadis
[1:30:37] Philadelphia those things and and that's
[1:30:39] the changing of the
[1:30:41] ministry now the relevant Ministry now
[1:30:45] on the Lan
[1:30:48] Ministry and then what does the Bible
[1:30:50] says
[1:30:51] about you another hard
[1:30:55] no you
[1:30:57] see and then they reject that they see
[1:31:01] now it's the ministry that is relevant
[1:31:04] to
[1:31:06] that the Bible
[1:31:09] says when the
[1:31:11] Devil comes in like a
[1:31:14] flag God
[1:31:18] raises now in closing Amen in closing
[1:31:22] what I wanted to say
[1:31:25] is that now uh a Believer does not
[1:31:31] die you just
[1:31:34] depart are we together amen now what
[1:31:37] makes him to
[1:31:39] depart made me to say it does not
[1:31:43] die
[1:31:45] because uh the Bible you read it in
[1:31:49] John it says you read verse 30 it says
[1:31:55] that's why he said I and my father
[1:32:00] are you see amen now when he says I and
[1:32:04] my father
[1:32:05] are it doesn't mean that this is my son
[1:32:09] I am the
[1:32:10] father then we become one I me I me we
[1:32:13] become two in that Cas but when he says
[1:32:16] I and my
[1:32:18] father he says I am God says if you
[1:32:22] don't believe that
[1:32:24] you'll die in your
[1:32:27] s together now a
[1:32:30] Believer when he
[1:32:32] depart he should
[1:32:34] be I and my
[1:32:37] father it should be God that is there it
[1:32:42] should be a minor
[1:32:44] God maybe let me read it and close
[1:32:47] it uh John chapter 10 and then I'm
[1:32:52] closing amen John chapter 10
[1:32:57] minutes just read ver
[1:33:01] 30 verse 30 John chapter 10 I and my
[1:33:05] father are one that is
[1:33:09] Jesus by the way who is his father is it
[1:33:14] Joseph okay if it's God when Mary was
[1:33:18] expecting a
[1:33:20] child who slept with Mary
[1:33:29] how so now let me tell
[1:33:34] you it's Z it's the angel of the
[1:33:39] Lord that came to
[1:33:42] Mary and said You shall
[1:33:46] conceive and bear a son and Mary says
[1:33:50] how
[1:33:54] and then he said the Holy Ghost will
[1:33:58] will overshadow
[1:34:00] me how did they how did the Holy
[1:34:04] Ghost the
[1:34:06] word
[1:34:09] that Gabriel
[1:34:13] spoke uh they started
[1:34:16] arguing until Mary says Let It Be
[1:34:19] according
[1:34:24] and then he said okay let it be
[1:34:26] according to your
[1:34:29] we believe
[1:34:31] that and when he believe that word and
[1:34:34] that word
[1:34:37] changed in his
[1:34:39] womb
[1:34:40] blood are we together and the blood of
[1:34:45] Jesus the
[1:34:47] DNA Jesus was that of the word of
[1:34:51] God are we together
[1:34:54] when he died when they pierc him on the
[1:34:58] cross that blood you know that the blood
[1:35:01] has got
[1:35:02] life the life of the blood is what we
[1:35:06] have
[1:35:08] received together we have received the
[1:35:13] blood the life of the
[1:35:16] blood
[1:35:19] when killed Abel
[1:35:23] what did God
[1:35:24] say his blood his blood your brother's
[1:35:29] blood tells the
[1:35:33] story are we together so now that's how
[1:35:37] it is now finish up let me
[1:35:40] close so now the blood when he says I
[1:35:44] and my father
[1:35:45] one which means his blood and his father
[1:35:49] and his father's blood are one and then
[1:35:53] our blood
[1:35:54] is a natural blood from our parents but
[1:35:58] we receive the word of God when we
[1:36:01] receive the
[1:36:03] word and that word when it germinated
[1:36:07] us build
[1:36:09] that that another
[1:36:12] body which is
[1:36:15] Christ like it did with with
[1:36:18] Jesus it descended from
[1:36:20] heaven after after H uh

[1:36:32] I and my
[1:36:33] father right finish
[1:36:37] it John
[1:36:39] 10:3 I and my father are one then the
[1:36:43] Jews took up stones again to Stone him
[1:36:47] Jesus answered them many good works have
[1:36:50] I showed you from my father for which of
[1:36:53] those those Works do you Stone me the
[1:36:56] Jews answered him saying for a good work
[1:37:00] we Stone thee not but for blasphemy and
[1:37:03] because th that thou being a man makest
[1:37:07] thyself God Jesus answered them yeah
