in as a substance amen now we are going back to the second part of this is we're going to read the same scriptures foreign food [Music] he is mentioned as the seventh angel messenger is all right now imagine to some other people have been reading is a false prophet um [Music] but the Bible says [Music] I send unto you [Music] so only you will receive it amen is to whom who will receive it is by whom okay foreign is coming soon and the Very um [Music] the pope is moving around [Music] even there is among Sinai foreign foreign foreign [Music] two scriptures fairly I say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of that day and that hour noeth no man no not the Angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father and John 14 20. at that day he shall know that I am in my father and he in me and I in you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judah said unto him not his Guardian Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world foreign yes sir today [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] you have started from utale [Music] if you can come on you know my tears are right on the back side of my eyes so I don't want to start praying yes amen gracious Lord foreign [Music] um father when you open them and father that Revelations [Music] [Music] it is [Music] we are fighting what is yazzy don't imagine Empower yourself two scriptures amen well you may be seated God bless you yeah okay the threefold revelation of God hey it's a great Revelation is I will take you today what is this threefold see yeah you know what what it is let me read something here again full baptism firstly invested 32. that play come on okay amen and North Norman it is foreign and well I'm here I will read you know this book Christ is the mystery of God who cries I've been keeping this book yes now I want you to listen to this page 33 now Christ who Christ it doesn't say Jesus amen amen Jesus when he was born then the angel said that is foreign it helps me if somebody doubts and yeah then the people come around and say amen amen ities another party [Music] the Christ this is page 35 I I I I are you the message believers foreign amen I don't keep the word of God in the selfish listen is now listen again now the Christ cook rest now it doesn't say Jesus eating the anointing us anointing of God foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] amen whether he preaches the Christ on Christ I coach that is Page 33 Christ is the mystery have you ever considered the church is just being made okay are you with me yeah you are with me yeah the spirit of the soul of Jonathan um and I was not surprised when the prophet said you are Christ amen Christ so it is referring to the plural um the Christ o Christ in the church is just been made known [Music] so the people that day yeah I don't know how they took it has been made me when was he made known amen amen but there there it says a man a man foreign [Music] [Music] I mean that's why at the end it says the spirit and the bride um and the prophet tells me non-profit the bride is exactly because under the threefolds the bride will say what God the father says all right now here manjella maybe you will underline this Christ in the church amen yeah then it goes down to this yes back to this again we've been repeating things and so forth to tell us in repeating things that's when you believe that by repeating somebody who has missed it last night look that's paragraph two things again for Christ in you who creates now it doesn't say Jesus in you that anointing makes him himself if now you take Christ we are going back um if it is in the father um [Music] you will speak the same thing the same anointing Christ in you who cries to go makes him the center of life um foreign [Music] Christ in the Bible believes the Bible when the Bible is amen Christ in Europe the complete Revelation do you believe that yes all right amen you know he has if there's no Christ in your Bible it should be Christ in him it makes it a complete Revolution amen [Music] Christ in you who Christ hey the Bible about the Bible it makes the Bible a complete Revelation is Christ it didn't say it makes your cell phone a complete Revelation um that's why you say I've read the Bible amen not even laptop the laptop we use it at home foreign when the lamp took not the cell phone the book foreign foreign amen now here comes something here it is so hard can only be seen within the threefold outside things are only understood foreign so if you put anything there the word um foreign um understand uh it doesn't say I eat by reading news the Bible says amen um that's why everything Satan comes strongest against the one who is [Music] [Music] foreign keep him in you amen that's why he says amen God said to Moses Moses Moses amen foreign and so forth I'm the man talking every time talking about Jesus amen foreign don't fight for me amen amen yes amen amen I have come to fulfill the way to die for the Sinners no one can kill me um I I I I give my life [Music] I'm not threatened angry feet [Applause] I'm in control meaning that's the Lord Jesus
