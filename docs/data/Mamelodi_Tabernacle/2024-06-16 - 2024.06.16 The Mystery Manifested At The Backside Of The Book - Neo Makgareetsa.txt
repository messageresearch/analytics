Description:
Title: The Mystery Manifested at The Backside of the Book
Preached by Elder Neo Makgareetsa on 
16-06-2024 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

Daniel 12: 4 | Revelation 10: 7 | Exodus 3: 1-5

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the mystery that was manifested at the back of the book.

The bible does not have answers to everything, but we became answers to everything. There are many people who see and hear what others can't, because it is an individual message.

When God want to talk to you he will remove you from the people and talk to you face to face.

God said to Daniel seal up the book and the things you heard, because the things Daniel saw were not for Israel but they were for gentiles who are individuals.

There are others who are looking at the unseen but others cannot see. When Stephan’s saw heaven open, others who were present could not see it.

Today we should not have mysteries as mysteries but we must have answers to these mysteries. If you still have questions you need to meet him in the backside of the desert.

The answer to the new testament must be somewhere.

When Moses was going to the backside of the secret he was Moses, but when he came back he was more than a man because he met God face to face.

When you are a Christian you don't live for yourself but you live for others.

The seven seals are the message from the backside of the book, which has the answers that the new testament did not have.

Jesus duty was to impart life and the pastor's duty is to impart life.

At the end of everything when you try to find out who God is He became a man. When Stephan’s saw heaven opened he saw himself, when Paul saw a man in the third heaven he saw himself. Brother Branham saw himself beyond the curtain of time.

The elder read the following spoken words:

56-0617 Revelation Book of Symbols Par 64
61-0611 Revelation Chapter Five Part 1 Par 156
56-0723 Led by The Spirit of God Par 53
60-0720 IT Is I    Par 177
65-0911 God’s Power to Transform Par 77

heavenly father amen we are glad to be in the house right we can feel the spirit is reing in this house Heavenly Father yes our brother standing before us the vessel that you have chosen this let us help us to look beyond the vein let us not size him father he may be an acquaint to some of us to some of us but help us this morning to see like our pastor is seen beyond that this vessel is suitable this morning to come and deliver the word amen heavenly father he has quoted the scripture that we are about to read yes we know everyone is every man has got the ability to page Through the Bible but as Heavenly Father once was said that teachers how to pray Heavenly Father we know without you we can do nothing Heavenly Father come and indwell him fully amen as we read this scripture Heavenly Father yes sir let the Holy Ghost Heavenly Father praise God expound what is in his heart Heavenly Father we pray and stand against every evil spirit that will withand this amen it has got no right to come and withand the word of God that's right where you are Heavenly Father we know everything is possible amen make it possible in our heart to receive this word that is going to be preached this morning amen we pray in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen Daniel 12:4 but thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fr and knowledge shall be increased am amen amen you may be seated may God richly bless you I've got two spoken word here in hard copies when you see me start reading them then you know I'm about to close because they have answers for the day the unveiling of God and the Mighty God unveil before us amen amen but for now we read the scripture and we many things many many think many people think that the Bible is got answers for everything but you will realize that does not not have answers for everything but we became the answer for everything where we read we see Daniel uh you know getting the message from God or from the angel from God revealing him revealing him a lot of things then he was about to write and then the angel said to him shut up the we and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall [Applause] run to and knowledge shall be increased amen amen is this the answer it's not the answer but is a mystery that was shut up so we don't have an answer for this and Daniel was in the Old Testament many years passed by that secret was still SE amen and you know before this scripture when you read Daniel chapter 10 this message come from the presence of God and Lucifer fought for 2 one days for Daniel not to get the message but after Daniel got the message God said to him shut that message at the right time it shall be revealed amen amen so my message this morning is about the mystery manifested the mystery man at the back side of the Bible because you will read the Bible from the book of Genesis until the Book of Revelation but brother says is still a Myster as a Clos book but the answer for this is right at the back of the who are at the back side of the Bible it's you you you you have the answer for the Bible you have the answer for the world so you are the answer so you know brother in the message called seeing or looking at the Unseen he said that message is for the individual there are many people that see what others cannot see that he what others cannot hear and is the individual message like when you read in the book of Exodus 3 from verse 1 to 5 verse 1 to 5 the Bible says Moses was a shepherd and God pulled him out and take him to the backside of the Des he remove it from the people and make him to be alone so that he can talk to him when God want to talk to you remove you from the people so that you can meet him face as long as you have this here says you are not sure you haven't meet him you are not even allowed to talk you are allowed to talk when we have that experience of the back side of the Des where you meet him face to face so Daniel saw something he had something he wanted to give it to the people but the heaven says no you know you just seal the thing and it's not a public thing individual it's not even supposed to be head in Israel because with Israel as a nation but God deals with a gentile as an individual that means this message of Daniel was for the Gentile was for the individual we are individual this morning and this morning and this morning there are others that are looking at the and see others cannot see it's natural a it's undeniable you cannot argue it it's like that it was always like [Music] that amen when Steven saw heaven open it was him seeing it the others were there but you didn't see it and when you see such fanatic to others exactly this morning when you see something and the person next to you do not see that you become fanatic amen amen we see Paul experiencing the same thing when he said to the people it's 14 years now I kept this secret he saw something when the heaven open but he couldn't preach it he he could even not say to the next person because some of the things when you see them and look at the people the way they disbelieve the word of God you can't even tell them you just keep it for yourself but the years pass by the years PP the 10th year PP keeping that secret but one of the days 14th year he just happens these people I tell them it happens today if I see something you don't see I will just say if you see you will see you don't see it's not for me to let you see but when you go at the back side of the desert where you meet him face to face you might see what I see because with you amen amen am then Paul say I saw a man in Christ amen amen only few but who that man he so I'm saying today we we mustn't have all those Mysteries as Mysteries but we must have those Mysteries having the [Applause] answers if he stay with us he will not hide anything for us he will reveal everything to us we will have answers for every question if you still have questions meet him at the back side [Applause] of it's an individual it's not a group thing because in the group amen one was saying um sorry a little bit like in politics our you know ruling government they were together in the Exile they were you know in good heart they were fighting the enemy and one of the days they conquer the enemy and then they take the government now the very same people that fought the enemy won the enemy they are fighting among themselves it's a group thing here in the message is not political it's not a group thing individual W like amen amen so Paul alone saw that wanted to share with the people others could catch others couldn't catch and Paul had the highest office in that time the office of an apostle and Paul was the messenger of the first church age Ephesus but he was scared to such knowing the heart of the people amen even our Lord Jesus Christ when he was preaching others could not catch but a few will go to he further explanation in the word of God we don't worship with groups not because we are friends not because we are colleagues not because we are family member not because we are in the same church individual brother if I don't see what you see you don't see what I see what can I do go back at the B side of the desert because these Min Mysteries are revealed at the backside of the Bible amen amen let's read the scripture Revelation chapter 10 verse 7 the common scripture because I want to show you something if we is the scripture giving us the answer re ver but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets amen do you have the answer isn't Revelation the book of the last book in the Bible but the more you read it is the more you confused I thought when we read already everything but it doesn't close everything because you will get many interpretation out of the same script amen amen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he declared to his the John is trying to tell you I don't have to there I'm not obliged to tell you because God said to him as well John seal the thing Daniel seal the Steven you can tell them if they don't see what you see it's none of your business so the whole Bible becomes a mystery the only moment where we can find the answer is when we go at the back side of [Applause] the I'm telling you when you look at the Old Testament going towards the new it's like when you are in the New Testament you get the answer for what happened in the Old Testament and when you get to the New Testament you get more un confused but now it's like the answer for the New Testament must be somewhere amen we have the answer get out of History a little bit be realistic live in a real world know where you are living know your standpoint we have been long talking about Abraham having the testimony where is yours this morning we must talk about your testimony we must talk about you because Abraham David Daniel is history let's come to our time and look what God has inst for [Applause] us in other churches you must just quote Adam Jesus go back to job everybody amen and the church what about you amen amen and others when you start you start talking about us they get offended they love Abraham who are we in the kingdom of God they had a bon that they left unto us we must talking about us hallu amen amen but remember Daniel was told by the angel I'm reading I'm reading at the Revelation book of symbol reation book of symbols Daniel had seven Thunders they Ed their voice Daniel grabbed his pen and started to ride and the angel says don't ride Daniel saw something what was that only Daniel know but I'm glad this morning we know what Daniel is if you don't know just wait I'll tell you amen amen don't you write it John saw the same thing and it had already written outside of the Bible John saw the same thing and it had already been written outside of the B inside the Bible was not written was not explained was not manifested wait at the outside of the B you will see what John and it had seven seals on the back of the [Music] book that no man could open those seals that was the voices here's the Bible written which is a Myster but at the back side of the Bible the Revelation was shown to Daniel said there seven voices to be uted that no man could open no man know what it was but the Bible says and I told and also John that in the last these seven voices will be known by the real [Applause] church I'm glad this morning I'm standing in front of the real true [Applause] church you will have the answer can you see see where the Falls where the Falls counter F trying their best to keep from place like them amen amen so this morning you you know the answer you have the answer because you are a true God you are at the back side of the Bible you are at the last [Music] because the last age the truth shall be known we we cannot forever saying the seals were open what are those seals we must tell the people that those seals Daniel so and okay John what is that amen amen we cannot always [Music] say don't you reach your destination one man was in a marathon from to P he was running right at the finishing point he keep on running hey the police have to run after him and say you have been long running here is a destination you are running there must be a problem then they check him he drugs they keep you flying not here you run at the end of the journey you stop you start to relax and say Lord God I'm Just Your Vessel I'm just a Living Sacrifice here if you want me to walk let me walk if you want me to speak let me speak do anything about me I'm here but what I need from you stay with Revelation 5 spoken with brother Bram says and he took the book and opened the book and lose the seals thereof lose the seals thereof he never told what happened to them when we hit them Seven Seals being open write down through the Bible watch what took place right in the seven CLE that's where we enter now all the whole mystery whole mystery not leaving one behind but the whole of all Redemption blessing of God remember he is the Lamb he is the only one that redeemed it and remember it sealed on the back side of the book not written within sealed on the back side and it's not written within and he was the only one was able to even open the book or to reveal the book or reveal the seal the only one capital letter that do that you see this coat has killed many this coat has killed many you will see what I'm trying to tell you because when he's the only one when they are looking for that one and they don't find him as per their expectation they [Applause] life amen amen amen now let's the spoken word led by the spirit of God I change now let's take a minute here is a man he's got all mil training he all Seminary theology in him he knows the Bible but he's a coward he's standing out on the backside of the desert scared to go down in Egypt scared of his own name he afraid to go down even to visit his loved one amen amen I love God I love the word of God when you met him you will never be the same again if you are the same again you are still in the jail you can sing that song I give you the permission still pulling you but those that are in don't pull them back to the desert at the back side of [Applause] the Moses when he was going at the backside of the desert he was Moses when he come back he was more than a man he met the supernatural he scared of no one because he has seen him when you have seen God when you have had God face to face with him when you come back you are no longer the same you know Moses was an ordinary like anyone you can even rebuke him but when he met God you better listen to him you better listen to him because he's no longer the same because one of the they came to him you are not the only one who God is talking to he can talk to God as well and God said to Moses it's okay let them prepare I will come and talk to them when God descend they say we don't want to see you please send Moses and talk to them amen amen there are other people by Nature they just belittling other people respective you have what God has in you just be little we had a meeting at work the other day you know in in in the work we don't have you know we are not at the same position when we are not in the same position we got Senior Management managing director was there as well and general man was there as well and we have construction crew General work we've got Artisan got surveying and all those kind of things then there was this value that we call you know [Music] respect then you started to learn that when the management talk about respect they about it for the sake of a company Val or company polic but who that one called General workers they are getting disrespected because of their position then I stood up and say I think when whoever made that value of respect God must have visited him because respect is not because of my position in the company but respect it's a soul to soul relation if you can respect that Soul you have respected God respective I'm anying peanuts you are having F Che F check doesn't matter respect me yes I will respect [Applause] you that's what is happen in life the spoken we it is I so when Moses when back to Egypt he was no longer the same because he met God I'm telling you today there are people who are meeting God face to face while you are still arguing is you arguing but there are people who meet God face to face if that is not the case why are we reading Bible what are we learning from the Bible who are we I don't know the height of Moses but the way you are strong maybe he was tall I'm not sure but the Bible says you know uh Jesus Christ when he was amongst them you could not even identify because he was just like that it's not about the structure of but is what he was you you will realize how powerful he was now God knows that in the end of the world go people's going to rise up great schols and intellect and explain all the Bible [Music] away and no man has a right behind the pit and no man has a right behind the P pit and no man has a right to call himself a Christian until he once got back there until he once got back there on the back side of under those God fa he had experience amen you cannot call yourself a Christian if you haven't met you might be longing the message you can break about that that I was baptized in 19 so and so but if you met him face to face sing your do you still he says if you are a Christian you no longer live for yourself you live for others as long as you are still living for yourself we will pray for you the day you live for others will give you a heart and say we are on the right side amen amen so we need to meet God face to face our pastor the other day said brother said something in me then I was listening to him during the week when we were streaming he repeated the same in con and say something in me as the pastor has [Applause] met but I was a bit disappointed I was a bit disappointed when I was looking at the stream status only few you know us the state I was wondering whether the children of God take the service on Wednesday serious or not you are missing out amen amen when send those link connect listen to your pastor what I've learned when the brother was saying something met and the pastor repeated the same thing then I say something [Applause] me what says if the pastor repeat I must repeat it amen amen as I was saying the other day that there was a certain teacher who was good in mathematics he was teaching the people the mathematics when he was teach them mathematics he could teach them some of the things because he was to them if I teach you all you will outshine me you must get this little so that I can be [Music] remaining now that teacher is late now the people are with limited [Applause] not our God not our Prophet not our pastor when we get taught we really get taught something that will sustain us [Applause] until am amen amenu standing in the capap the message well it happened to be at least one man in present this morning who was standing there when it happened that is brother and some other things honestly they are not easy to utter I saw brother Bram as well going there going there try to check if ever what I'm trying to cheat will have place in the heart of the Saints it actually shook the rock off of the mountain and now we found out that during that time I saw seven angels in a form of a pyramid that St down and picked me up and I was brought East to open the seals for [Applause] God Amen it was not an easy thing for brother say yeah let me read for you where he said it God's power to transform he said now it's hard to say this it's very hard because speaking to people who feel the same way I do the way I been for many years but since the opening of those seals of the Angels just behind the mountain Yonder this has become a new book is the things that been [Music] he is been revealed as God promised in the Revelation chapter 10 that he will do it and we are privileged we are privileged people that God have chosen of this Earth that we might see and understand this things which is not some mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying to make it up is the word of God made manifest proven that's right PA hold this secret for 14 years brother to say this it was not easy because it was talking about [Applause] him there was never a time where Jesus Christ says I am God the creator of Heaven said but when the people look at him they crucify him saying you being a man you make yourself God he never said I'm God but they crucify him for that reason because they read the Bible the scroll and they've seen how God does things when they see God doing things and they look at Jesus Christ they see the characteristics of God in him and they just need to be assassinated because he's a man the son of Mary and Joseph but he make himself some other things you cannot hide the more you hide the more you get [Applause] exposed even people with evil Hearts when they try to the more they get exposed that they have hearts that are [Applause] [Music] evil You Can't Hide yourself amen amen question and answers and now the opening of the seals that was given by the Holy Spirit the Seven Seals was only to make known you see the reason why what had been [Music] left of in the dispensation behind us the dispensation behind us are a dispensation in the Bible they are behind us the reason why the seven seal open is for us to make [Applause] know we cannot continue talking about Bible as the one just read no sometimes somewhere somehow you need to hit the [Applause] call if you haven't hit the call says you are not yet a worshiper the children of Israel in the journey those was that one came out of Egypt they didn't reach Canan because of their hard and heart those that one were born on the way and God did that deliver same thing today since the open of those seals it's a Harding amen amen didn't know how to put it but because he's a prophet he have to put it for the beneficiary the [Applause] Bri he said angels in the form of a pyramid sh me down pick me up those seven angels pick him up put him in the middle and take him to go and open the now tell me didn't the Bible said only the lamb should open the L now the Bible read us we will look at this and said to brother what are you trying to tell [Music] us the Bible says the lamb that was slain before the of the world and the Bloody lamb is the one that is worthy to open the seal but today you open the seeds for [Applause] God service after the service there will be a meeting I don't know the elders friendship and so for and say Brothers we thought we were on the right track no no no we've left it now you've heard him yourself he says he opens the now is it him or is it the L then you agree AG that it is actually now what is this man talking about there you go because it's two contradiction you must choose the lamb you must choose brother or brother is the Lamb Brothers our own understanding will not make it in the word of God that's why us and explain this to and we must be like the children of you know the Disciples of Jesus Christ when they do not understand they will leave the people to go and there go to Pastor Jesus and say p he will definitely do that Lear to relax God will give you the answer he will never leave you [Applause] alone don't want to mention name one of my friend left here and now we are lost when we saying we at the pit under it's under when we no long talking about I said let's go I to I said brother I I was also listening lening what you have seen I haven't seen what you have heard I haven't it what I see I see God take Tak me from this position to another position from that position to another position feel free to go we are still friends it's not group thing did you hear me it's an individual what you see is not what I see what I hear is not what you hear but do what is in your heart because if you come here not believing and agreeing and following what your pastor is teaching you're just hitting yourself you come to church angry you go back home Angry why can't you just go where your heart is I have a the mess as well so the other day he went to M sown match he a fan of M and others here you [Applause] know he saw Flames man the cameram man just saw a a very excited man and zoom him then I was at work reading news 24 when I was reading news 24 I saw my new I took out my spectacles and I said it's him then I read the story how the man was happy he was with number one what do you call it fan number one [Music] of I've never heard you sing at a church but at you were jum says you know this people angle I said that's where you get joy when you're looking at sundown you are happy when you are in the church you are [Applause] bit I'm saying this because it's my and he knows that I'm I'm he a very nice brother he Fellowship the message but I told him that so he respect [Music] me amen I don't know because I might take your time [Applause] there some people naturally they quiet you find them you will not you will not believe your [Applause] eyes the Feast of the trumpet message brother says the trumpet of God shall sound the death in Christ rise a new body and we which alive remain shall be changed in a moment in a twinkle of an eye Hallelujah and shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the aend the secret has been made known the seals are open do you know that there are people that believe the message but they are denying the open of the seal but the the seals are the entire message that means they are denying the entire message when you deny the entire message you deny God you you just a church let's go to church but you know youy brother meet [Applause] him I'm getting there yeah spoken with now that our Lord has opened the seal seven seal mystery of his weight to us in the last age Martin John Wesley Wesley Columba St Martin ir and them they were not at the last age and they were aware of that that is why when Martin Luther come will say a judge shall that is not the message of the it was the message of them but the message of the this all the secrets shall be known and if you are living at the last Age The Secret was never known to you you haven't [Applause] reached and the question is a Bible question we are invited to believe there must be a true answer to the whole hidden secret has been he since the foundation of brother Bram says how privileg the Mysteries were hidden before the foundation of the world but here we are today having the answers of all the questions [Applause] amen Hall amen and the Bible prophecies and says that in the in in the day this secret will be made known according to Revelation chapter 10 at the sounding of the seventh angel messenger the Myster of God will be made and this is the last AG which is was preaching this message in 1965 but he said to us you and me we are in the bright AG we have a past that means any time the reptor can take us home now I start to understand why he knew that time he will be gone and he said your pastor will see you through he will see you through as the bride now the focus FOC should be at a man that see you [Applause] through amen there's other churches will tell you we believe the Old Testament Testament in the New Testament it's them amen amen but us we believe the message side of the [Applause] Bible the seven seal is at the back side of the where we have answers for what new testament not have where Old Testament not have brother says we are living in a grand age where God is in a plain view where everyone enter in now I'm reading what I promised hard copies from this spoken word h let me start with the Mighty God unveil before us and I was checking the Year brother preached it was June 29 1964 1964 after the you know mystery of the seven seal in 1963 now God is building his church amen amen always all the years the man of God says the men of God in the old and the New Testament they had one thing common to see God Amen because God was just talking to them they were just seeing Miracle but the same what is happening that is why others resulted in ancestral wor because they didn't have the answer but listen here page say had job but his desire job was to see God you know job was the son of God but he haven't seen God he wanted to see him and he was made known to God through will wind yet he did not exactly see him but God was veiled inwind [Applause] saying we found Down in Africa South Africa they use the word which means an unseen Force you just pray you just close your eyes and pray and God give you the answer father who is this God Amen and this unseen force in the will wind had an audiable voice that was job wanted to see God and Moses as well wanted to see God and God gave me an opportunity and he saw the back part of a man which means the Unseen was made visible God to whom I worship God to whom I worship is now in a man I saw the back part of and he was happy but like then life goes on as you today you are in the message but really you are still probing amen whether you are on the right track or what whether you have seen him or not who is this God yes is with us but the Bible says is now in us because God whom you worship himself in aen can I tell you that is the seven SE [Applause] page 15 you will hear what the prophet says amen he said there's a word in Greek that uses [Music] kenos he emptied himself out and mor he changed from what he was to what he is he never Chang his nature but on the day of the Pentecost he changed from being the son of man to the Son of God he came not with the people he came in the the same God to carry his ministry on through in this great age amen amen so now he himself made himself known to us and indwell himself in us until when you walk it's not you walking it's not walking when you speak it's not you speaking speaking using your body today God is using [Applause] when the seven seal was open there was silence in heaven about space of an half an hour and then God leave the throne when he leave the throne he came down when he come down the angels in heaven those that were saying holy holy to the Lord they stop because you cannot holy holy the empty SE when God comes down the Angels were looking at him and they see God incarnate himself in a human flesh and the angels leave Heaven as well follow that one they are saying holy holy when he incarnate himself in a human fles they keep on saying holy holy they keep on saying You Are Holy One amen that's what brother B was trying to tell when God comes down he give him all the authority amen born of a woman and a man open the seals for God when we say the only worthy one was the Lord Jesus Christ blood lamb but we see brother say today this morning in front of this pit opening [Applause] the if you can find out you might realize that half of the church that day never came back the next as I'm saying we need to be realistic the pastor stand behind the and say we are going to the uttermost to save the people after service many went [Applause] back God can cannot start his journey with his man and along the way just leave him that is not God that was something else but if God started a journey with you he will make sure you will finish [Applause] that I remember one day I preached here behind this ppit about the deliberate way of God for downsizing the people if this church is overflowing and God wanted to downsize he will do it those that do not belong here they will go out and never come back if brother did it and Jesus did it who are we will give the message in front of this P that will make ours others to go and not come back not our duty it's God Judy because this p is blessed by God himself it's God talking behind this addressing you even now if someone decided de God bless you this is the time we are living in where we cannot hide ourselves where we need to pursue what God has put in our heart for Judas for Judas to be long in the message and be with Jesus does not make him a Christian does not take him to heaven but one of the days Jesus will turn around and said to me this cut is [Applause] do that which is in your heart we have things in our heart we are hiding them because of some other reason but one of the days that will best and will see your true colors the people have colors but one day you will see the true color the true color when you take a decision and the one you worship visited you you know Pharaoh I was reading the history of pharaoh not not in the Bible but as Egypt somewhere in the library I was checking how Pharaoh was good and I was convinced at well I was convinced as well Pharaoh was a good man as good as he was but he was ordained for dnation when that moment come he won't hide it Pharaoh Even Called Moses Moses pray for me Moses prayed for Pharaoh so that all those plates can stop amen amen but God said there should be 10 you you pray when Moses you will pray for Pharaoh but the plagues before God are 10 if he come eight or n they are not enough they should be 10 then phara will call Moses Moses you know me I know you were eating together but now you punishing me to your for me will put hands on him and that hands that's not going to stop the plague that God has for [Applause] Pharaoh then the last play came and God said Moses enough is enough I am the one who's doing this you don't have to worry I do them we are not an exemption to that amen amen same thing will happen today as many as we are other people have their own agenda you won't know it until it's visible and what I know about this message the more you come to church the more you follow sheep the more you are like Pharaoh one of the days you will be exposed [Applause] I hope I tell you that you must stream as well I hope I told you you must live stream especially on Wednesday because 56 hits on a Wednesday streaming while we are more than 2,000 come on what will you [Music] doing because I learned from that I was not in Congo when the pastor was preaching but they captured it it's now here my own benefit because when I was listening when the pastor was saying something in me has met me I will [Music] say I will do like because I need to be a follower and a very good follower while you are denying that I'm benefiting amen am unveiling of God unveiling God amen amen unveiling that means something that was Veil and when he unveil when I read this book as I'm closing when I read this book away go and read it the more God is unveiled when you read fa in a man when you read a in a man you end up saying then God is a man the other day he said as he was walking a certain Minister came to him and said the people are making God out of you that means you can write another Bible brother Bram could take the spirit in him but he came very nice then brother Bram says I mustn't add or subract from the Bible but what the people say about me is not far from the [Applause] truth now brother is God then I listen to the P he said we are God the god whom we cannot worship but if you individualize him as what say and attack it you miss the mark because our pastor should be the waving sheep you know you know what is a waving sheep something will P up there and look up to it and be like it what he says is what he have remember say and uh yes some other things I take them to task with other friends of mine not to everybody others were saying you worship your pastor but I said to him you know what I didn't know Jesus when I went to church that's when I went to I didn't know but if this man has showed me brother follow him and when I follow him one of the days what he will that is the seven when you see God in a man and follow that man that cause in that man will end up being you well if that is the case and the pastor started preaching it will be amen amen amen to amen will they here when ah he started then you are at the wrong [Applause] place late 7s my father was driving then he will get a mechanic fix those car points now you see the fixing it and it's V8 or six cylinder V8 C I look at my father was smiling then I would look at take cig just look at the is the water coming out you see I see happiness and Happ you know a deep call to the I was still young and looking now if one comes you're going to fight I'm trying to tell you that in this church we must be like an old machine where where we meet God face to face and it becomes an amen to amen amen to am you know as a leader sometimes the people do not know where you lead them you must just be a good follower and a good follower somewhere you will say I didn't know but now I know I didn't see but now I see like Elijah like elishah with this man when they were walking together Elijah was looking at the Unseen but the other man couldn't see what Elijah was looking at and then [Applause] please open his eyes so that he can see what I see you have been long fellowshipping you have you have been long felling you have been long coming to the church you might have not seen something but may God help you to see the Unseen when you have seen the Unseen brother my sister you'll never be the same again they will anger you you will project the 11th command I was listening to the other day he was saying the greatest miracle I have seen in brother Bram was for my dad not to differentiate between the people he love and the enemies his enemies and the people he was the [Applause] same yeah you can't hear him saying you know what I I really looked at him until I threw yeah they say you really if if you don't [Applause] fall he was he was a prophet the 11th command when that love project the grace took [Applause] over Jesus was looking at this young rich man and the Bible says he loved him he knew his destination but he looked at him he loved him he looked at Judas he loved him knowing his [Applause] Destin because Jesus his duty was just to impact life brother his duty was to impart life our pastor his duty is to impart [Applause] [Applause] life go away you know traveled serious I'm trying to bring a serious M here amen amen same can we learn from them can we learn from them Lear from your elders learn from the prophet Lear from Jesus those are the only people you can Lear as I was talking to another brother he was doing some other things then I went to him what you are doing what did you learning from where you learnning [Applause] if you learn this from tell me now it from or you learn it from the pastor tell me now you Le it from the pastor but you cannot do anything that you didn't learn from [Applause] the are we together so in closing I promise you I'm going to read these last two books the unveiling of God unveiling of god let's see what brother says here in page amen amen he said the anointing is a person the anointing is a person Christ means an anointed one what the prophet what theet now you better listen then Moses was Christ he was the anointed one Jeremiah was Christ in his with the portion of the word for that day but when Jesus came he came as a redeemer the anointed one and that Mo that both Moses and own that was all in Moses and all the words and all the God was Ines that's the reason whole Temple rent Veil rent and the M come in perf he was the anointed one notice now the veil in human flesh the promise W to this age must also be veiled [Applause] [Applause] say he this confuses me are you confused this morning it's timey to tell you you no longer differentiate between God who created heaven and earth in Christ Jesus and yourself one thing [Applause] P 33 is the last quote and I close amen remember the Son of God was not revealed to Sodom two Messengers was and that's right but this God himself in a human flesh was revealed to Abraham Abraham they elected and watch what he he done to reveal himself and now Abraham knew when he knew that was inside his thought behind him was in s's thought he said called him Elohim amen amen so at the end of the day at the end of the age at the end of everything when you try to find who God is come amen amen amen amen now I want to tell you this when Steven said I saw heaven open he saw himself when Paul say there's a man in Christ he saw himself when Daniel had all those things he saw himself John saw himself brother came and say I was up there I saw myself my Cass was down here but the real me was up there can
