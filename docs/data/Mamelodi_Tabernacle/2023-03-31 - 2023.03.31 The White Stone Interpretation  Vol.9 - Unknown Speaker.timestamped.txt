[1:35:41] question
[1:35:44] saying uh you are a stout
[1:35:51] man amen amen

[1:36:28] photo to accompany my
[1:36:32] photo because we started together back
[1:36:35] [Music]
[1:36:37] there and walked together long
[1:36:44] distance in this areas as he was leading
[1:36:48] me to use a parents
[1:36:52] place still
[1:36:55] remember and we are together
[1:36:59] still still working
[1:37:03] together amen amen you start
[1:37:07] like in a physical
[1:37:11] form but when you come to the
[1:37:15] end of the
[1:37:18] natural you find your still still moving
[1:37:22] working
[1:37:25] together but now in the spiritual
[1:37:30] form showing
[1:37:32] that um the
[1:37:35] distance taken by the physical
[1:37:40] form is so
[1:37:43] short then we were
[1:37:47] many in physical
[1:37:50] numbers but at the end of it all
[1:37:55] uh we are not many in the physical
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:02] numbers we have
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:06] shrink
[1:38:08] Supernatural
[1:38:10] numbers we have
[1:38:12] sh back to the
[1:38:16] supernatural it was just one H mile of
[1:38:22] light
[1:38:24] then brother Bram
[1:38:27] says from
[1:38:29] that came
[1:38:32] forth because the
[1:38:35] son says this natural
[1:38:38] things the first thing was
[1:38:43] SL was the
[1:38:45] son amen amen and uh I'm reading
[1:38:49] something
[1:38:51] here H that shows
[1:38:55] where I am where we are coming
[1:39:01] from is from a
[1:39:07] single in the beginning was
[1:39:11] light amen amen now that's why the
[1:39:15] prophet taught me
[1:39:18] that it started from one
[1:39:22] thing
[1:39:25] as he he says we were
[1:39:29] chosen
[1:39:33] in
[1:39:35] before amen amen
[1:39:41] before all right
[1:39:43] amen we have no
[1:39:48] Foundation but when he started the
[1:39:52] church
[1:39:54] he spoke of the
[1:39:56] foundation of the
[1:40:00] prophets and
[1:40:02] then
[1:40:05] Apostles that's the
[1:40:08] foundation started
[1:40:10] there but you go back you wind
[1:40:15] back we find only one
[1:40:20] thing when he spoke in this book
[1:40:26] Ephesians chapter
[1:40:30] [Music]
[1:40:32] 4: just let's let's hear it amen and
[1:40:37] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:40:40] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[1:40:51] redemption Ephesians for yes sir grieve
[1:40:55] not the holy spirit of God yes where you
[1:40:59] are
[1:41:02] SE the
[1:41:08] day now meaning
[1:41:12] that and he says the day of
[1:41:16] redemption is the day the book is
[1:41:21] open you see amen Redemption has
[1:41:26] come uh to to to
[1:41:30] those who were
[1:41:33] chosen but it says
[1:41:36] before that's why when you
[1:41:39] arrived when he arrived he said of
[1:41:45] us he said the the world hatte
[1:41:50] them and the world hated to
[1:41:55] them the reason that they are not of
[1:42:00] this
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:04] world we
[1:42:06] are we
[1:42:08] are
[1:42:14] okay now let us read this part
[1:42:18] here seven I have book Seven SE
[1:42:23] and don't even don't lose even one of
[1:42:30] them brother I had my book set ready
[1:42:35] here okay let me read that
[1:42:40] again uh from the book of is this the
[1:42:47] time amen amen
[1:42:52] and in this book
[1:42:56] says is this the
[1:42:59] time let me read
[1:43:02] it all right amen uh that is
[1:43:07] [Music]
[1:43:09] from that is page
[1:43:13] 26 I will read from this place
[1:43:17] here before we start reading amen you
[1:43:22] know brother br
[1:43:24] God spoke to
[1:43:29] him uh he was not preaching to
[1:43:33] us after he has read us a
[1:43:38] book he God spoke to
[1:43:42] [Music]
[1:43:44] us through
[1:43:47] brother he he became God's
[1:43:52] book now if you don't see it from that
[1:43:57] book you haven't heard what God has
[1:44:01] said because the first book of
[1:44:04] God is aen am amen
[1:44:09] amen so that's how we receive the
[1:44:12] message of
[1:44:15] God don't look
[1:44:18] around and like saying I want to hear
[1:44:22] what that brother
[1:44:23] would
[1:44:25] say want to know what he would say about
[1:44:31] this go straight to the
[1:44:35] book the seventh angel
[1:44:39] messenger the speaking
[1:44:42] book The Talking
[1:44:45] book amen amen you won't miss a
[1:44:49] spiritual
[1:44:52] point yeah this is in
[1:44:55] writing amen but you won't get it
[1:44:59] right until you read the speaking
[1:45:05] [Applause]
[1:45:08] book amen amen so I we we are looking
[1:45:13] here at the speaking
[1:45:18] book The Prophet has
[1:45:21] spoken amen amen
[1:45:23] now how do you keep the word of the
[1:45:27] [Music]
[1:45:28] Prophet because nobody will keep the
[1:45:32] word of the Prophet for
[1:45:38] you it should be
[1:45:40] something personal to
[1:45:44] you amen amen that's why now if God
[1:45:49] takes his
[1:45:51] prophet Lees a
[1:45:58] Shepherd the work of the me as a
[1:46:03] Shepherd is to see
[1:46:06] that the
[1:46:10] sheep have they keep
[1:46:13] on or they
[1:46:16] kept the
[1:46:18] word from the living and breathing word
[1:46:22] of of
[1:46:27] God so that's why to me brother
[1:46:32] BR uh I took him as a
[1:46:37] living
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:46] speaking that's why even
[1:46:49] today I'm still with him
[1:46:54] amen
[1:46:55] amen and he has also given me a
[1:47:01] [Music]
[1:47:03] pastor now I
[1:47:08] read in the Bible here we will realize
[1:47:14] that we are being of
[1:47:21] Eternity because the prophet
[1:47:24] says everything that was
[1:47:29] created has
[1:47:33] an maybe did you hear
[1:47:39] it I think I've got the
[1:47:41] [Music]
[1:47:47] book yes if not I can just
[1:47:51] quote
[1:47:54] I don't see the other books
[1:47:56] here oh yeah CH yes
[1:48:02] sir without a an out
[1:48:07] cover almost most of my
[1:48:16] books but they are still much
[1:48:20] alive I read here
[1:48:24] page
[1:48:25] 21 2 that is the
[1:48:30] SM I can't prounce it yes Church
[1:48:36] H in every
[1:48:40] church we are told that there's
[1:48:45] tws you find twins in every
[1:48:51] Church amen meanwhile borrow me the
[1:48:55] Rapture if you've got one
[1:48:57] day now in every Church
[1:49:00] age you
[1:49:06] find that said the
[1:49:08] prophet and throughout the seven Church
[1:49:12] ages you find
[1:49:16] Twins and he says one is
[1:49:21] spiritual and the other one
[1:49:25] all
[1:49:26] right and they won go
[1:49:31] together up to the
[1:49:36] end it
[1:49:39] was
[1:49:42] and they could not go
[1:49:46] together to the
[1:49:48] end they were
[1:49:51] twins one was
[1:49:54] one was
[1:49:56] spiritual in every Church age we
[1:50:00] have said the prophet of God and the
[1:50:05] spiritual in every
[1:50:09] church amen amen so I read
[1:50:14] here and the blood
[1:50:17] test shows whether you are or
[1:50:23] whether you of God or
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:29] not blood
[1:50:32] test because the prophet told us
[1:50:36] that when H
[1:50:39] Gabriel the prophet
[1:50:41] Gabriel came to
[1:50:44] Mary amen am and they spoke to
[1:50:48] Mary and
[1:50:50] Mary received
[1:50:53] the word from the
[1:50:56] angel you know there's another book here
[1:50:59] I will find
[1:51:01] it where
[1:51:04] John said to that man
[1:51:08] Prophet
[1:51:11] Angel and the angel said to
[1:51:14] [Music]
[1:51:15] John what the what did the angel say
[1:51:19] says I'm one of your fellow servants
[1:51:21] worship God yes amen because he wanted
[1:51:24] to
[1:51:25] worship that
[1:51:29] angel
[1:51:30] the was so
[1:51:33] strong in the soul of
[1:51:35] John until he he wanted to
[1:51:40] worship and that angel
[1:51:42] said don't
[1:51:46] don't because I
[1:51:51] am
[1:51:54] amen let me look at it
[1:52:00] here because we coming to that
[1:52:05] distinctive
[1:52:08] [Music]
[1:52:10] Angel right in the end
[1:52:14] time because the message
[1:52:17] now is of uh pyramid of the Angels
[1:52:25] am amen am not of
[1:52:29] bricks that
[1:52:31] one who's this brother who had a dream
[1:52:35] junior junior Jackson junior Jackson he
[1:52:39] looked at the structure
[1:52:43] there and uh he
[1:52:46] says then brother Bram
[1:52:50] brother interpreted to
[1:52:54] him that
[1:52:57] structure this
[1:52:59] structure it started with
[1:53:03] the
[1:53:07] Cornerstone now brother
[1:53:16] Sayed to the Head
[1:53:21] St now but I before we start let me read
[1:53:28] this uh firstly and the blood test shows
[1:53:33] whether you are of God or
[1:53:39] not because he says the the angel came
[1:53:44] to
[1:53:45] Mary and the angel spoke to
[1:53:50] Mary and when Mary
[1:53:54] lived what was revealed to her or told
[1:54:00] to became
[1:54:05] blood that's said the
[1:54:07] prophet God it
[1:54:11] became that's why I think so many
[1:54:16] people do not understand about this King
[1:54:19] men
[1:54:21] redeem
[1:54:24] what does Kings
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:28] mean the
[1:54:32] Kings now it says the book was in the
[1:54:37] hand of Adam when Adam
[1:54:42] fuled then it went
[1:54:44] back to the original
[1:54:49] owner now this original owner
[1:54:53] came as a king's
[1:54:59] man and they were
[1:55:01] surprised when we look at that SC that
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:08] scripture we were
[1:55:11] saved by the by the blood of
[1:55:18] [Applause]
[1:55:19] the the Lord Jesus is a
[1:55:24] family to to
[1:55:27] us now we couldn't be saved by any
[1:55:33] blood it should be the blood of the
[1:55:39] kingsman it makes us one with
[1:55:44] him amen
[1:55:47] amen we
[1:55:50] cannot because we are saved
[1:55:54] by the
[1:55:55] blood of our King's Men amen amen amen
[1:56:00] God wanted us to be
[1:56:03] exactly like
[1:56:05] him to be
[1:56:09] him am am amen that's what Redemption
[1:56:16] means
[1:56:18] Redeemed by the blood of the
[1:56:21] king
[1:56:24] amen amen you know once it is the blood
[1:56:28] of the
[1:56:32] kingsman then no no one will follow
[1:56:36] you with some harsh
[1:56:40] words love one another pay your
[1:56:44] ti don't you know because the blood is
[1:56:49] of the
[1:56:51] king
[1:56:53] if we are
[1:56:54] all redeemed we were Redeemed by the
[1:56:58] blood of the
[1:57:01] k then you don't even need to encourage
[1:57:05] encourage us to love one
[1:57:09] another the BL that
[1:57:14] speaks that's why he didn't come and say
[1:57:19] Adam why why why did you do this
[1:57:23] why you do this no he shed his
[1:57:27] blood you know I love that when brother
[1:57:32] says when he
[1:57:34] died and he was
[1:57:37] buried you know three
[1:57:40] days then he says because uh he took
[1:57:46] when he he comes into the
[1:57:51] gap
[1:57:53] yes standing in the Gap standing in the
[1:57:56] gap which
[1:57:58] Gap because men and God were
[1:58:03] one he tells you even in this
[1:58:06] book Christ is the mystery of
[1:58:09] God and God
[1:58:13] were and then he says men and God are
[1:58:17] one
[1:58:19] here the real Church of of God the of
[1:58:25] Christ is Al
[1:58:30] andega he is
[1:58:37] om now when
[1:58:42] Gabriel brought the
[1:58:44] word he brought the seat of
[1:58:48] God to that
[1:58:51] vir
[1:58:53] Mar Maria amen amen you'll watch later

[2:05:07] time then he asked says is it the
[2:05:13] T then it continues to
[2:05:16] say uh you know there was a
[2:05:20] blast and uh
[2:05:22] he saw that the
[2:05:25] lightning and then coming down he says
[2:05:31] but it
[2:05:33] shook the Earth and when it did I was
[2:05:38] still looking
[2:05:40] wor now uh the first day back you
[2:05:46] realize that men was placed
[2:05:50] eward
[2:05:52] the Garden of
[2:05:54] Eden now you have east and
[2:05:58] west you know to look on your board
[2:06:02] here the
[2:06:05] direction the here this
[2:06:08] scripture in this book it
[2:06:12] introduced East and
[2:06:15] West men was placed
[2:06:20] East and
[2:06:22] that's why the prophet in order to
[2:06:26] connect with the
[2:06:29] supernatural to go
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:34] west and the prophet
[2:06:37] also
[2:06:40] came they came to meet the
[2:06:49] prophet okay now I
[2:06:53] read uh it shook the
[2:06:56] earth when it did I was still looking
[2:07:03] Westward meaning he
[2:07:06] was e he was in the
[2:07:11] East
[2:07:13] and way of into
[2:07:20] eternity
[2:07:23] amen then because the
[2:07:27] angel every time you see an
[2:07:31] angel you believe that he is from
[2:07:37] eternity he's an
[2:07:39] angel amen amen now that's why we will
[2:07:43] come quickly to the H pyramid of
[2:07:49] angels where e
[2:07:54] I was reading something
[2:07:57] here where it it tells
[2:08:01] me of
[2:08:03] this year amen oh the
[2:08:07] angel you know how that
[2:08:11] man the angel came to I had it here with
[2:08:15] me brother just now
[2:08:18] ameny no that angel oh
[2:08:23] John bow down to
[2:08:30] worship an
[2:08:33] angel did you see what happened
[2:08:36] there and the angel said don't do
[2:08:41] it and you know I had the page right now
[2:08:43] here to show
[2:08:45] something the angel said don't
[2:08:49] bow to worship me
[2:08:52] me I
[2:08:56] am I
[2:08:59] am I'm am th fellow servant one of your
[2:09:02] brethren yes amen I'm one of the
[2:09:07] Brethren now brother Bram says it must
[2:09:12] have been
[2:09:14] Elijah or one of the
[2:09:16] prophets but the Bible says it was an
[2:09:20] angel
[2:09:22] H all right that's why at the
[2:09:26] end when after the church
[2:09:29] ages he speaks of the of this
[2:09:34] distinction
[2:09:36] Angel
[2:09:38] distinctive distinctive
[2:09:40] angel now he say you see I heard the
[2:09:43] page right now but you know
[2:09:46] it but the prophet of God
[2:09:49] says it must have
[2:09:52] been
[2:09:54] Elijah or why because he knows that it
[2:09:59] was a
[2:10:01] man amen amen amen and of course we do
[2:10:05] will'll come to a flying
[2:10:09] angel when he he
[2:10:12] speaks of the flying
[2:10:15] angel what happened
[2:10:18] there all right but this one he says
[2:10:23] it's a
[2:10:24] worshiper that angel said I'm also a
[2:10:28] worshiper but the Bible says it is an
[2:10:33] angel now the angel
[2:10:36] explained John that I am also one of
[2:10:41] them and brother said it must
[2:10:47] have I said amen
[2:10:50] amen
[2:10:52] amen amen amen because uh if at the
[2:10:58] end we see this
[2:11:00] Angel are coming like an
[2:11:04] angel then we know then he
[2:11:09] says we know all right I'll come to that
[2:11:12] to read it better but we know
[2:11:15] that the distinctive
[2:11:18] Angel is only one angel
[2:11:22] amen you have
[2:11:25] oneel let me read amen this is now we
[2:11:28] are entering the new
[2:11:31] [Music]
[2:11:34] Commission because the first commission
[2:11:37] was of healing of the
[2:11:39] SE the gospel preaching of the
[2:11:43] Gospel that was the old
[2:11:47] commission but the the the new
[2:11:50] Commission
[2:11:53] like if we talk about the
[2:11:56] pools the first was small
[2:12:00] B the
[2:12:03] second the second the
[2:12:06] do thir the
[2:12:09] Angels amen am so now but here I wonder
[2:12:15] my what happened to my page but you know
[2:12:17] it amen amen amen that he says that
[2:12:23] angel must
[2:12:28] have must have been
[2:12:32] Elijah or one of the
[2:12:36] prophets and I was reading alone
[2:12:39] there I said yes
[2:12:43] elah all right
[2:12:46] amen don't think of
[2:12:50] wings
[2:12:53] Wings think of an
[2:12:57] Angel because even here it
[2:13:02] introduced it
[2:13:04] said the distinctive
[2:13:08] angel on the right hand
[2:13:11] [Music]
[2:13:13] side okay the right hand
[2:13:17] [Music]
[2:13:18] side and uh
[2:13:22] a brother SC at
[2:13:26] me
[2:13:28] when I said something
[2:13:33] like people of the right
[2:13:35] hand they thought I was talking
[2:13:41] about amen
[2:13:44] am the book of H John
[2:13:47] chapter
[2:13:50] 5
[2:13:52] what happened there
[2:13:53] brother before we start
[2:13:55] here and even
[2:13:57] finish okay amen Revelation chapter 5
[2:14:01] yes and I saw in the right hand of him
[2:14:05] that sat on the throne a book written
[2:14:07] within and on the back side sealed with
[2:14:11] seven Cals yes on the on the back side I
[2:14:16] see on the right hand right
[2:14:20] hand
[2:14:27] what a
[2:14:29] book and
[2:14:34] say amen
[2:14:38] amen let leave it until we read it am he
[2:14:42] speaks also of the right
[2:14:46] hand the mysteries of
[2:14:49] God came down
[2:14:51] from the right
[2:14:55] s the book was in
[2:14:59] the right
[2:15:01] hand then when the book was on the right
[2:15:06] hand in the right
[2:15:09] hand now if you go down from the
[2:15:13] right you find the
[2:15:16] angel on the
[2:15:19] right the came from the right hand
[2:15:23] side the angel on the right hand
[2:15:28] side to the right
[2:15:30] hand
[2:15:35] people the true bride of
[2:15:37] Christ is the people that are on the
[2:15:42] right and they are not
[2:15:45] confused because they are the right
[2:15:49] hand
[2:15:51] when
[2:15:52] God dispatched
[2:15:55] something it comes down the
[2:16:01] right that's that
[2:16:04] book uh no one could handle that
[2:16:08] book only Adam because Adam was the
[2:16:11] right
[2:16:15] hand that's why we standing in the
[2:16:19] game the G
[2:16:21] was caused by the absence of
[2:16:26] Adam God and
[2:16:28] Men I'll read it to you that is in the
[2:16:32] book of Christ is the mystery of God is
[2:16:35] the Myster of God the prophet says and
[2:16:37] men were one
[2:16:40] there and God and men one
[2:16:46] here amen that's why we don't talk about
[2:16:49] churches
[2:16:52] no we are talking God and Men right
[2:16:58] there amen
[2:17:00] where we one day amen and then he says
[2:17:04] now God and man are
[2:17:07] [Music]
[2:17:09] one am don't become a church
[2:17:13] Go part of
[2:17:17] God because a church go stable
[2:17:23] that's why I've seen some people they
[2:17:27] come to church as the pastor maybe uh he
[2:17:31] stands for as the pastor's
[2:17:35] interpreter
[2:17:36] sorry he is the pastor's
[2:17:40] [Music]
[2:17:41] interpreter and taking some
[2:17:45] notes when the book of the notes is
[2:17:49] full
[2:17:59] now you can't start a
[2:18:04] church you can't start a church with
[2:18:08] quotations our quotations God is Not
[2:18:12] quotations God is a
[2:18:15] spirit they they that worship him they
[2:18:19] don't worship him through
[2:18:22] quations worship him through the
[2:18:26] spirit because God
[2:18:29] is where before he could send
[2:18:33] them he said wait in
[2:18:37] Jerusalem then I'll come to you
[2:18:39] now as a
[2:18:42] spirit because the true
[2:18:44] worshipers him
[2:18:47] in and Truth
[2:18:51] am all right amen you see that is that
[2:18:56] now I've seen some
[2:18:58] people after
[2:19:04] interpreting they become
[2:19:09] Pastors in
[2:19:12] personation brother B says
[2:19:16] impersonation is
[2:19:19] dangerous
[2:19:22] because it's not God it is
[2:19:27] you because that one said that
[2:19:30] word you are only
[2:19:33] repeating what another one has
[2:19:37] said but when the we comes from the
[2:19:40] prophet
[2:19:43] notation it's the wa from God to
[2:19:49] you reputation is
[2:19:52] dangerous if you take it from
[2:19:55] somebody who has missed a
[2:19:58] point you will
[2:20:02] also but if it is from God it comes
[2:20:06] through the
[2:20:07] prophet amen amen the prophet will never
[2:20:13] [Applause]
[2:20:15] miss amen but I've seen some
[2:20:18] people they take from another
[2:20:23] man from
[2:20:26] God
[2:20:28] impersonation it is
[2:20:30] dangerous because you can respect a
[2:20:33] man and if what if that man is not in
[2:20:37] the right
[2:20:42] place and you take from
[2:20:45] him this this is what has
[2:20:49] confused and the
[2:20:51] churches because it's
[2:20:55] impersonation
[2:20:57] everywhere look how
[2:20:59] many churches we've got
[2:21:03] today you come in one
[2:21:06] location you find this is the message
[2:21:11] Church why they can't come together this
[2:21:14] one says seals are not re this one says
[2:21:19] this and that one says
[2:21:21] amen amen amen his
[2:21:23] children H they came through
[2:21:30] impersonation but if it is from God to
[2:21:34] the
[2:21:35] prophet to the
[2:21:38] Past amen amen it is
[2:21:41] something
[2:21:43] that's of
[2:21:47] godine all right Amen Let me before
[2:21:50] includes with
[2:21:52] this
[2:21:53] uh we I haven't started but here here is
[2:21:58] something I say brother Bram asked a
[2:22:02] question the angel
[2:22:05] said the Bible
[2:22:08] says that
[2:22:12] angel let's talk about that
[2:22:15] angel don't do it
[2:22:19] don't it it but when he looks at
[2:22:25] it that's why you look at the
[2:22:27] distinctive
[2:22:31] Angel and I remember brother
[2:22:36] sometimes he shed tears some tears
[2:22:40] because when people said to
[2:22:44] him he is
[2:22:47] God Amen and yet
[2:22:51] the word says the sons of
[2:22:54] God Amen
[2:22:57] am it caused a lot of
[2:23:01] dust when we were reading from The
[2:23:04] Prophet's
[2:23:05] book the sons of
[2:23:12] [Applause]
[2:23:14] God Amen because
[2:23:19] God
[2:23:21] yeah yeah God
[2:23:25] [Music]
[2:23:27] be
[2:23:29] amen now brother bam brother
[2:23:32] bam he come straight and say sons of God
[2:23:37] are Min
[2:23:41] God because God can only give birth to a
[2:23:49] god
[2:23:51] amen okay amen how many amens
[2:23:55] [Applause]
[2:23:59] here
[2:24:04] get but only the
[2:24:08] gods we could not
[2:24:12] worship but because they are from
[2:24:16] God are
[2:24:19] God
[2:24:22] how can
[2:24:23] God trust
[2:24:27] pastor and say look after my
[2:24:31] sheep unless he is a
[2:24:35] [Applause]
[2:24:37] God God don't take that
[2:24:42] chance if you say man look after my
[2:24:47] sheep that means god
[2:24:50] has given this
[2:24:52] man a
[2:24:55] [Applause]
[2:24:57] godship amen amen that's how it
[2:25:02] goes the true
[2:25:08] pastors that's why he says you listen to
[2:25:12] your
[2:25:16] [Music]
[2:25:19] pastor it is in your book
[2:25:23] adoption I remember there was an
[2:25:26] outcry after we have read that
[2:25:32] quotation that we
[2:25:38] are
[2:25:43] because now this God minor
[2:25:47] God he brings to you the word of God
[2:25:53] amen am he's a minor
[2:25:56] God God will never say I will come
[2:26:00] myself

[2:39:00] amen we actually we are coming to
[2:39:07] something that will also help me now
[2:39:14] today the
[2:39:16] disciples they some one day they asked
[2:39:19] the
[2:39:21] lord of the end time
[2:39:26] side and he said to
[2:39:29] them uh it shall be like in the days
[2:39:37] of
[2:39:40] Amen during the time
[2:39:43] of you you know it you've watched it you
[2:39:46] know it was fire
[2:39:51] Noah during the time of Noah it was
[2:39:58] flat now have you not seen those things

[2:40:04] happening they are there happening today
[2:40:07] and Nation against
[2:40:12] Nation can you see those things amen
[2:40:16] because I was talking to a
[2:40:18] sister
[2:40:25] back that comes from God comes through a
[2:40:28] prophecy
[2:40:31] why when he was
[2:40:34] born predestinated it did not surprise
[2:40:37] the predestinated ones
[2:40:39] because God's
[2:40:42] Prophet spoke and said behold behold a
[2:40:48] child yes amen a church did he say a
[2:40:52] church a vision shall conceive a vision
[2:40:54] shall
[2:40:55] conceive amen amen amen then he says a
[2:41:00] son son is given a son is
[2:41:03] given he's born unto
[2:41:07] us amen we have has been born unto us
[2:41:13] then that's when that
[2:41:17] prophecy was fulfill
[2:41:27] this people they are not
[2:41:30] [Music]
[2:41:31] drunk they are not drunk by wine it is
[2:41:34] what the
[2:41:43] Propet
[2:41:46] Church Prophet fulfillment of a prophet
[2:41:49] it's based on
[2:41:57] the it doesn't work by saying someone
[2:42:00] say there was a brother like this it
[2:42:02] goes by prophecy the Fulfillment it is
[2:42:06] that's why fulfillment of
[2:42:10] Prophecy it tells us that there's no
[2:42:13] more
[2:42:15] time amen the signs we see
[2:42:20] we recognize them and we look back and
[2:42:24] say the Lord Jesus spoke of
[2:42:29] this when you shall
[2:42:32] see at that time of the of the
[2:42:35] flats there's something that happened
[2:42:39] there that was
[2:42:41] new
[2:42:42] [Music]
[2:42:45] and but did you see what
[2:42:48] happened
[2:42:50] that
[2:42:51] Noah said to
[2:42:54] Lord men let's
[2:43:00] separate why the Bible says
[2:43:13] Lord
[2:43:18] Abraham
[2:43:20] so each of
[2:43:24] them had
[2:43:28] his am you see the that
[2:43:33] CA the Bible
[2:43:36] say
[2:43:39] Abraham
[2:43:41] had livestock
[2:43:48] and Trel comes to church like
[2:43:54] that now what happened
[2:43:57] there
[2:43:59] uh if the pastor comes God has given him
[2:44:04] the
[2:44:07] word and I take while the pastor is
[2:44:13] preaching oh I didn't know about this I
[2:44:16] put it down like
[2:44:18] this amen
[2:44:20] amen now I
[2:44:23] leave I go to
[2:44:27] place the ones that have not heard the
[2:44:30] pastor when I got there I said bre now

[2:45:06] [Music]
[2:45:08] pastor yeah now he
[2:45:10] says I thank God by his grace I was
[2:45:14] there bowing down there then he came
[2:45:17] down and spoke to me
[2:45:21] all
[2:45:24] right I I I I'm trying
[2:45:28] to it is like my mother told me of
[2:45:33] something the
[2:45:46] two now both
[2:45:51] they had a
[2:45:58] problem Oh call it

[2:46:12] say one of the two
[2:46:17] girls
[2:46:23] it
[2:46:25] says and the other one
[2:46:31] says all of them they are missing
[2:46:35] it and they it became a big
[2:46:39] fight and this one was say no no it's
[2:46:43] that is what is happening
[2:46:47] today and so forth
[2:46:55] if
[2:46:57] Moses God told
[2:47:01] Moses to use that
[2:47:03] Rod again you see what happened because
[2:47:07] it is God who told Moses then he called
[2:47:12] the Bible calls it the road of
[2:47:16] God it doesn't say the RO of
[2:47:20] no the
[2:47:22] of Amen then if he
[2:47:25] comes to the
[2:47:27] Sea and SM
[2:47:30] Thea and the Sea
[2:47:33] open amen there was another man I've got

[2:47:51] they had to cross the the
[2:47:53] river there were lot of ring that

[2:48:05] Moses as he Smite the
[2:48:07] waters I have my stick here amen
[2:48:12] amen then he Smite the Watchers will The
[2:48:16] Watcher depart no
[2:48:19] it is not God who said
[2:48:21] that
[2:48:24] now now after his might there they just
[2:48:27] say a little
[2:48:29] bit now he just went in
[2:48:32] [Applause]
[2:48:35] there now they had to search and look
[2:48:38] for him with a
[2:48:40] boat Moses used a
[2:48:43] stick given to him by
[2:48:47] God God blessed
[2:48:51] that called the road of
[2:48:56] Moses the road of God God Amen Let me

[2:50:04] is of all the other
[2:50:08] seals he says and when it was
[2:50:13] revealed Revelation
[2:50:16] 8 it says speaks of the
[2:50:22] which but it
[2:50:24] says it speaks of the
[2:50:29] opening because all the
[2:50:32] seals under the
[2:50:37] seven amen amen now H for God to open
[2:50:42] unto
[2:50:44] us there all all the seals because all
[2:50:49] all this time he kept on
[2:50:54] saying they are not
[2:50:57] revealed they are not
[2:50:59] re amen amen he mentioned only the
[2:51:05] six because the
[2:51:08] sixes
[2:51:11] and but the
[2:51:13] seven hallu now while passing there the
[2:51:17] six
[2:51:19] Moses
[2:51:21] elah amen amen
[2:51:24] and what about Moses and
[2:51:28] Elijah because it's a
[2:51:32] seal to the
[2:51:36] Jews all right am and you know about
[2:51:42] Transfiguration when they appeared in
[2:51:47] their we are still
[2:51:50] and
[2:51:50] then one of
[2:51:52] them that was
[2:51:59] Moses amen amen
[2:52:03] now the book
[2:52:06] says this
[2:52:10] Elijah to the
[2:52:13] Jews was an
[2:52:16] Elijah of
[2:52:19] did you hear him talking about
[2:52:24] it of the
[2:52:26] Gentile am amen amen but this
[2:52:32] one then he comes and
[2:52:35] say let's follow standing in the
[2:52:38] Gap the Gap amen amen we haven't yet
[2:52:43] come to the White
[2:52:45] Stone come I don't have a problem I've
[2:52:50] got a
[2:52:51] pastor amen amen right the Elijah Spirit
[2:53:01] of from
[2:53:05] the it can
[2:53:07] be a different
[2:53:10] man the
[2:53:12] spirit is
[2:53:15] of amen amen amen now we realize that
[2:53:22] this
[2:53:24] Elijah Moses and
[2:53:26] Elijah that was that is for the
[2:53:30] Jews it is coming we know
[2:53:33] about we see what is happening in
[2:53:36] Jerusalem is happening with the
[2:53:39] Jews all
[2:53:41] the we are looking
[2:53:43] at what is happening with
[2:53:46] Russia all this you know the real church
[2:53:50] is based on the
[2:53:55] revealed and fulfilled
[2:54:01] prophecy is that right you read the
[2:54:05] newspapers and some people just read the
[2:54:10] newspaper but they the prde of
[2:54:14] Christ they know because these things
[2:54:18] the
[2:54:20] spoke said when you shall see
[2:54:24] this when you shall see the
[2:54:26] flood are we not seeing the
[2:54:29] FL all right some see them but they say
[2:54:35] is what climate clate
[2:54:40] church today is not a
[2:54:45] fulfillment to
[2:54:47] them amen to us is the
[2:54:51] Fulfillment
[2:54:53] the you see the
[2:54:55] difference if they see these things they
[2:54:59] say climate
[2:55:01] church we say What the Lord
[2:55:06] Has that's the difference but those of
[2:55:10] the wisdom of the
[2:55:12] world call it climate
[2:55:15] change those who have received it from
[2:55:19] God you know that is a
[2:55:25] prophecy the Lord Jesus has
[2:55:29] spoken is that right now you take
[2:55:35] Abraham abah and
[2:55:38] Lord Abraham Abraham was uh of the
[2:55:43] promises of
[2:55:46] God lord was just an
[2:55:51] person now the Bible says
[2:55:54] Lord had his
[2:56:00] own use that word substance
[2:56:04] substance and
[2:56:07] Abraham now when the time
[2:56:10] arrived Abraham
[2:56:12] said
[2:56:15] Lord will do this because the the
[2:56:19] Shepherds of Abraham and
[2:56:24] Lord they were against one
[2:56:27] another now he said now you
[2:56:30] watch Abraham said now if you take this
[2:56:35] way I will take
[2:56:37] this then he say
[2:56:42] Tru Abraham knew
[2:56:44] that Lord will never choose the right
[2:56:47] place
[2:56:52] because the only person who to choose
[2:56:54] the right
[2:56:57] place is the person that God spoke
[2:57:04] to he
[2:57:08] said now the Bible says he started now
[2:57:11] to look
[2:57:14] around then he was attracted when he saw
[2:57:17] Sodom
[2:57:27] and showed to his friend to say amen
[2:57:30] amen think
[2:57:32] amen what do you think
[2:57:35] of look at those
[2:57:38] fields we can build they
[2:57:41] say amen
[2:57:44] amen then the Bible says now Lord Lord
[2:57:50] chose before it was
[2:57:56] Destro can you hear he
[2:58:00] chose before it was
[2:58:06] destroyed amen amen because his
[2:58:09] choice was not the choice that was not I
[2:58:13] mean was not of
[2:58:16] God but before
[2:58:18] even now I'm
[2:58:20] closing but you have to make your
[2:58:24] choice before this
[2:58:29] world is
[2:58:33] judged let
[2:58:34] me we are still coming with
[2:58:42] that the signs that are
[2:58:45] here what are they saying to you I
[2:58:48] realiz that the people don't see
[2:58:52] this am
[2:58:55] amen just like
[2:58:58] Lord that's
[2:59:01] why
[2:59:02] Abraham the Bible says Abraham early in
[2:59:07] the morning he woke
[2:59:11] up and walked to the
[2:59:15] place where he stood before
[2:59:22] maybe we are not getting
[2:59:25] something God spoke to
[2:59:28] Abraham about what was
[2:59:32] coming and when that prophecy was about
[2:59:37] to be fulfilled the Bible says early in
[2:59:40] the morning he
[2:59:43] went where he stood before the Lord
[2:59:50] that's how the word comes to
[2:59:52] us he puts
[2:59:55] us we
[2:59:58] stood where we stood with
[3:00:02] him he take us back to that
[3:00:06] position there reason why the Bible says
[3:00:10] early in the morning he walked where he
[3:00:13] stood before the
[3:00:16] Lord
[3:00:18] why because it was by
[3:00:21] Revelation that he should come to the
[3:00:24] place and look from that
[3:00:27] place as even he told him back
[3:00:31] there he said look when he he he was
[3:00:37] looking look from this
[3:00:41] place amen amen you know why I'm
[3:00:45] here with you while we are
[3:00:49] here he has placed
[3:00:53] us in a place where we can see all those
[3:01:00] things you know before God can deal with
[3:01:04] you he has to put you in the right
[3:01:08] [Applause]
[3:01:11] place all right amen where the right
[3:01:15] place the message will be the right
[3:01:17] message
[3:01:20] [Music]
[3:01:21] you will meet with the right
[3:01:24] people that's why he
[3:01:26] said early in the morning now he knew
[3:01:31] that his
[3:01:33] binoc is Jesus Is God amen amen what do
[3:01:38] you call the one you use for telescope
[3:01:41] telescope telescope amen
[3:01:44] telescope you see look far away
[3:01:48] now
[3:01:52] Abraham was his
[3:01:55] telesc that's why as maybe that night he
[3:02:01] was thinking of the things that God has
[3:02:03] told
[3:02:06] him but Revelation in the
[3:02:09] morning took him to that
[3:02:15] place before God can show you
[3:02:19] he has to put
[3:02:21] you on the right
[3:02:25] place before you can see these
[3:02:28] things God has to put
[3:02:30] you in the right place first before you
[3:02:34] can
[3:02:36] see the right
[3:02:38] place you should worship under the right
[3:02:43] p a pastor who is under the guidance of
[3:02:50] God amen amen before you start
[3:02:53] worshiping you must find the right
[3:02:57] place God don't just
[3:03:02] speak amen amen that's why Abraham knew
[3:03:08] that for me
[3:03:11] now to see the
[3:03:14] Fulfillment I've got
[3:03:16] to find the right
[3:03:19] [Music]
[3:03:21] because we will come to that where
[3:03:23] brother
[3:03:27] says the
[3:03:29] seventh was
[3:03:30] [Music]
[3:03:36] opened we
[3:03:41] have back in
[3:03:44] Genesis back in Genesis
[3:03:48] now the
[3:03:49] people who can see the opening of The
[3:03:56] Seven it says that
[3:04:00] that
[3:04:02] Revelation is
[3:04:07] from that's why he say you have seen
[3:04:09] from
[3:04:12] your now your theop was in the mind of
[3:04:16] God
[3:04:19] back
[3:04:20] there when he started to set up
[3:04:25] things
[3:04:27] watching that's why today he you have
[3:04:31] heard now if
[3:04:33] youve somebody comes and say the this
[3:04:38] this it's not a
[3:04:46] problem amen God has given it to
[3:04:50] you
[3:04:52] before am all right amen so when it is
[3:04:57] open it is open to those who have heard
[3:05:01] [Applause]
[3:05:07] it okay they are not looking for
[3:05:11] it because uh if God has given you
[3:05:16] something
[3:05:19] you don't go around looking
[3:05:22] for amen am because
[3:05:26] already was
[3:05:28] told
[3:05:30] told when the time
[3:05:33] comes then she go she went
[3:05:36] around I
[3:05:42] knowah how do you
[3:05:45] know because the Bishops in the church
[3:05:48] the prophets they don't know
[3:05:51] [Music]
[3:05:54] abouts I
[3:05:57] know am one
[3:06:01] says hey I read in the Bible here this
[3:06:05] this will happen but the other one comes
[3:06:08] and say I
[3:06:11] know meaning that she has heard from
[3:06:16] her
[3:06:18] amen she was not waiting for
[3:06:21] somebody and say
[3:06:26] it Abraham knew for me to see that I
[3:06:32] must go to
[3:06:33] him and from that
[3:06:36] position to know
[3:06:42] about so he woke up in the morning to go
[3:06:45] to the right place and from that place
[3:06:49] you
[3:06:50] saw now you must find the right
[3:06:55] place before you can see you got to get
[3:07:00] to know the
[3:07:02] right find the right place then from
[3:07:07] there you will see that's why we can see
[3:07:12] Sodom what is now
[3:07:14] happening it must be from the right
[3:07:17] place
[3:07:19] that's why he said look from the look
[3:07:24] from
[3:07:25] here that you
[3:07:27] see shall be
[3:07:29] gred
[3:07:35] look you know that scripture
[3:07:38] brother you know the scripture all right

[3:07:48] to my

[3:08:24] the L
[3:08:32] that you know

[3:08:46] now
[3:08:49] oh it's like when they open a new
[3:08:51] denomination I can take you by
[3:08:55] emotions and then and you think that
[3:08:57] you're not predestinated if you are not
[3:08:58] predestinated oh actually if you're not
[3:09:00] predestinated be taken

[3:09:11] from thou amen there must be a
[3:09:16] place

[3:09:27] place he saw what did
[3:09:34] he that's right amen and for
[3:09:40] himself God showed
[3:09:42] him the
[3:09:46] pr
[3:09:49] our God is so
[3:09:52] fair with his a
[3:09:56] [Music]
[3:09:59] subjects a true

[3:10:04] worship singing and
[3:10:07] dancing he knows where he
[3:10:11] is a true
[3:10:13] worshiper will never worship until he's
[3:10:16] in the place of of
[3:10:20] worship true
[3:10:22] worship knows when when he is right with
[3:10:25] God or
