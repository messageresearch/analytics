[37:26] [Music]
[37:34] I greet the children of God this
[37:37] afternoon.
[37:42] in the precious name of our Lord and
[37:44] Savior Jesus
[37:49] Christ.
[37:51] Um while we are standing on our
[37:56] feet, let's open the book of
[38:01] Revelation. We are going to read
[38:03] Revelation chapter
[38:06] 21.
[38:09] Here we are going to read from verse 1
[38:14] to
[38:22] 6. Revelation 21
[38:25] 1-6. And I saw a new heaven and a new
[38:29] earth. For the first heaven and the
[38:32] first earth were passed away, and there
[38:35] was no more sea. And I, John, saw the
[38:38] holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down
[38:41] from God out of heaven, prepared as a
[38:45] bride adorned for her husband. And I
[38:48] heard a great voice out of heaven,
[38:51] saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is
[38:54] with me, and he will dwell with them,
[38:57] and they shall be his people, and God
[39:00] himself shall be with them, and be their
[39:02] God. And God shall wipe away all tears
[39:06] from their eyes. And there shall be no
[39:08] more death, neither sorrow, nor crying,
[39:13] neither shall there be any more pain,
[39:16] for the former things are passed
[39:18] away. And he that sat upon the throne
[39:22] said, Behold, I made all things new. And
[39:26] he said unto me, Write, for these words
[39:29] are true and faithful.
[39:32] And he said unto me, it is done. I am
[39:36] Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
[39:39] end. I will give unto him that is a
[39:42] thirst of the fountain of the waters of
[39:46] life freely.
[39:48] Let's read the book of Isaiah chapter
[39:51] 66. We read verse
[39:56] um 13.
[40:00] Isaiah 66,
[40:03] chapter 66,
[40:06] Jesiah 66,
[40:09] verse 13. Verse
[40:13] 13. As one whom his mother
[40:17] comforth, so will I comfort you, and ye
[40:21] shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
[40:25] Let us lift our eyes as we pray.
[40:29] My dear heavenly
[40:33] father, this is the privilege
[40:36] again you have privileged us with
[40:41] to stand in front of this group of
[40:44] people here
[40:46] being your children
[40:49] in
[40:50] this
[40:52] time in this situation which they are
[40:55] in. Yes. because someone they loved so
[41:00] much has left them.
[41:04] We are standing here coming with your
[41:08] word because you said the word is the
[41:11] only
[41:13] comfort there
[41:15] is. Come Lord be with us.
[41:19] comfort us all with your word as we pray
[41:24] in the precious name of our Lord and
[41:26] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[41:30] We may take our seats.
[41:37] Uh as usual
[41:39] um we are not going to be
[41:42] too long.
[41:48] Um when things like this happen,
[41:55] we have to know where we
[42:02] are. We have to know what we should
[42:08] do. We have to know what happened after
[42:11] this.
[42:16] I've got the very short topic.
[42:21] The topic is
[42:25] the place of rest,
[42:32] peace and comfort.
[42:37] the place of rest,
[42:42] peace,
[42:44] and comfort.
[42:48] living here on earth.
[42:53] When you read the book
[42:55] of Proverbs,
[42:57] [Music]
[43:01] chapter 9 verse 5,
[43:07] it says,
[43:09] "Everyone knows that he's going to die."
[43:13] Everyone knows that he's going to die.
[43:19] And when we read the book of Jeremiah
[43:23] chapter 8 verse4, chapter 8 verse14, it
[43:27] says
[43:31] we must gather
[43:34] together and run to the fortified
[43:37] cities,
[43:41] strong cities.
[43:45] So, so that we can go and die
[43:49] there because we know we are going to
[43:53] die. We must know where we should die
[44:05] at. Um DM chapter 18 verse 10. Chapter
[44:10] 18:10 it says the name of the Lord is a
[44:13] mighty
[44:18] tower. The Russians run into
[44:23] it because you are going to
[44:27] die. You must know where you can run
[44:32] to. He says the name of the Lord.
[44:36] is a mighty
[44:38] tower where the Russians run into
[44:43] it and they are saved.
[44:47] It says the
[44:49] righteous. It don't say any
[44:53] person but it says the
[44:56] righteous run to it.
[44:59] Then when we follow this
[45:02] rashes we go
[45:04] back we find that God said to
[45:09] Moses he who take one's
[45:13] eye this eye must also be
[45:17] taken he who cut somebody's
[45:21] ear his ear must also be
[45:26] cut. Then they found that
[45:29] There is somebody who has taken
[45:32] someone's
[45:34] eye but not
[45:37] deliberately. But because the law
[45:40] says his eye must be taken
[45:43] up. He had to go there and his eye must
[45:46] be taken
[45:48] up. Then God said to
[45:50] Moses, "Go and build a house of refuge."
[45:57] the houses of
[45:59] refugees. And then when somebody has
[46:02] done
[46:04] wrongly, not
[46:07] willingly, he must run to that
[46:11] city. We are following the way the
[46:15] Russ says the
[46:20] Russ is the is the Russ who runs into
[46:23] it.
[46:26] That's why the houses of
[46:29] refugees. It was for the
[46:32] Russians. If for those who have done not
[46:37] willingly when you rush
[46:40] there, you find that there is the first
[46:44] gate. The people who want to
[46:48] revenge they stand. They when you enter
[46:51] at the first
[46:52] gate they stand at the outside the
[46:56] gate then in the in in there you are
[47:00] going to find the priest
[47:03] there who have got the
[47:05] revelation who have got the
[47:08] discernment you must present your
[47:11] story that I was throwing a
[47:14] stone perhaps I was want to kill the
[47:17] bait
[47:19] but unfortunately the stone hit that man
[47:22] in the
[47:24] eye and he took that man's
[47:26] eye. Then when they are listening to you
[47:30] they can they can find that you are
[47:33] talking the right
[47:35] thing then they will open the the second
[47:39] gate. Then when you get in the second
[47:42] gate then you are saved. Then you are
[47:46] going to stay
[47:47] there until the death of the high
[47:51] priest is then when you will you are
[47:54] going to be
[47:56] released. But if they find that your
[47:59] story is not the
[48:01] truth, not the
[48:03] Russians, they take you back to the
[48:07] Avengers, then you are your eye must be
[48:10] taken
[48:11] off. That's why the people who runs
[48:14] there is the people who have done wrong
[48:17] not
[48:20] willingly. That's why the Bible says the
[48:24] Russians runs there.
[48:27] and they are saved. Then when we read
[48:30] the book, let's read the book of Isaiah,
[48:32] my brother.
[48:34] Isaiah chapter um I'm going to tell you
[48:37] Isaiah chapter uh 35. Isaiah chapter 35
[48:44] verse 8 to 10. Verse 8 to
[48:48] 10. and an highway shall be there and a
[48:52] way and it shall be called the way of
[48:55] holiness. The unclean shall not pass
[48:58] over it but it shall be for those who
[49:02] way fearing men. Just just stay there.
[49:04] They say the highway shall be
[49:08] there and the
[49:11] way and then the in this
[49:15] way the unclean shall not pass over
[49:20] there. In other words, the unrighteous
[49:22] shall
[49:25] not this place and the the the cities of
[49:32] refuge and the the name of the
[49:35] Lord. It seems to be the same
[49:39] place because there are only the
[49:42] Russians who must pass
[49:45] there. And when the read the Bible goes
[49:48] on,
[49:50] and a highway shall be there and a way,
[49:54] and it shall be called the way of
[49:56] holiness. The unclean shall not pass
[49:59] over it, but it shall be for those
[50:03] wayfairing men. Those fools shall not
[50:08] therein, though fools shall not therein.
[50:12] Go back. Go for further. No lion shall
[50:15] be there. You see, no lion shall be
[50:19] found
[50:21] there. No ravenous beast shall shall be
[50:24] found
[50:25] there. But that place is only for the
[50:31] Russians. It is the place of
[50:34] peace. It's the place of
[50:37] rest. It is the place of comfort.
[50:41] The name of the Lord is the place of
[50:45] peace, is the place of
[50:48] rest, and is the place of
[50:50] comfort. And the
[50:53] highway is the not the way, is the place
[50:57] of
[50:58] peace, is the place of comfort,
[51:02] and is the place of rest.
[51:06] The Bible says
[51:07] here it is for the
[51:11] righteous. It is for the
[51:14] redeemed if you are not the
[51:17] redeemed you don't belong to that
[51:20] place. That place which is the place of
[51:25] peace, which is the place of rest, which
[51:28] is the place of
[51:30] comfort, is for the
[51:33] righteous, is for the
[51:36] redeemed. And if you are a
[51:39] redeemed because
[51:41] redeem it means to bring back to the
[51:45] original and the
[51:47] redeemed are written in the book of
[51:50] redemption.
[51:53] only the
[51:55] redeemed are qualified to be
[51:59] there. They are also the the ones who
[52:01] are
[52:03] qualified to be the children of
[52:07] God. They are only also the only people
[52:12] qualified who are qualified to run into
[52:16] the the name of the Lord.
[52:21] What is the name of the
[52:24] Lord? Before we get
[52:27] there, the
[52:29] redeemed their
[52:31] place is the
[52:33] way, not the
[52:36] highway. Because the highway has many
[52:39] people in
[52:41] it, but the
[52:43] way because is a highway in the middle
[52:47] there. There is a way and in that middle
[52:52] road it is only for a few
[52:55] people and those few
[52:58] people they are called the
[53:01] redeemed and the redeemed are written in
[53:04] the book of
[53:06] redemption and the book of redemp the
[53:08] Bible says
[53:09] here you are sealed by the Holy Ghost
[53:15] until the day of redemption.
[53:19] And when is the day of redemption?
[53:22] The day of redemption is when were
[53:26] open. When the things of were opened, it
[53:30] was the day of
[53:32] [Music]
[53:33] redemption. When the book was
[53:35] taken and it when it was opened, it was
[53:40] taken and opened and that day it was the
[53:44] day of redemption.
[53:46] But when Jesus come with the open book,
[53:51] he's coming to claim his
[53:54] own not to redeem them. Because through
[53:57] seven
[53:59] churches, he was a lamb. He was a
[54:02] mediator. He was doing a redemption
[54:05] redemptive
[54:07] work. Then when the the redemptive work
[54:09] is
[54:10] over, he stood up. He's he he changes to
[54:15] from a lamb to a
[54:17] lion. And when he is a lion, it means
[54:21] he's the
[54:22] king. He is our king
[54:24] now. And he took the book. When he is
[54:28] the king and he come back with the book
[54:32] in the book
[54:33] there were names there and the names the
[54:36] names of the
[54:38] redeemed. The redeemed are those who are
[54:41] in the place of
[54:44] rest. When they pass
[54:47] here when they die from here, when we
[54:50] say they are dead, they are not dead.
[54:54] They are sleeping. They are going to
[54:57] rest. And they they have gone to the
[54:59] place of
[55:01] rest. And they have gone to the place of
[55:04] comfort.
[55:06] to be comforted.
[55:11] The redeemed when he when he's coming he
[55:16] was coming with a book and in that book
[55:20] there were the
[55:21] redeemed he he he was coming to
[55:25] claim. Amen. Amen. those whom he has
[55:29] redeemed through
[55:34] 8. Are you together with him?
[55:38] We
[55:39] know he came in three sons
[55:43] name. He was the son of
[55:46] man, the son of God and the son of
[55:50] David. The son of man is Jesus Christ.
[55:54] We know. He said, "Who do men say I the
[55:58] son of
[55:59] man?" He called himself the son of
[56:02] man. Then through the seven church
[56:05] ages, God was building his
[56:08] church because he built that
[56:11] church through seven
[56:14] spirits which is seven
[56:17] stars. And that was the time of the son
[56:20] of
[56:22] God. When he was the son of God, he was
[56:26] a lamb. He was a
[56:29] mediator between man and
[56:33] God. And at the end there come to Luke
[56:36] 17:30.
[56:39] But Jesus said, "When the son of man is
[56:43] revealed, the son of man says, the son
[56:47] of man will be revealed."
[56:50] Are you together with me? Jesus was the
[56:52] son of man. He said when the son of man
[56:57] is it means he means he's going to be
[57:01] revealed
[57:02] again. It means he is coming
[57:05] again. He is the son of man.
[57:08] man is going
[57:11] to at the end of the
[57:15] gentile then he's at the end at the end
[57:19] of the son of
[57:22] God must be revealed
[57:25] again that is the that is the
[57:28] dispensation we are living
[57:31] in if you can say the son of man is not
[57:36] revealed then you Don't believe that God
[57:39] has sent us a
[57:41] prophet because the the son of man is
[57:45] revealed. He revealed himself through
[57:47] the
[57:50] prophet. Then there is no more time that
[57:54] we can wait that the son of man is still
[57:56] going to be
[57:57] revealed because he has revealed himself
[58:01] already through the
[58:03] prophet. Because God cannot do
[58:07] anything be before he can before he send
[58:11] the prophet. In other words, before God
[58:14] can do
[58:16] something
[58:17] prophet, before he can take the book, he
[58:21] must send the book. Before he can tell
[58:23] us what are seven
[58:25] thunders, he must take the book. If I
[58:28] can tell us what beast what this beast
[58:30] is, he must send a prophet. If I can
[58:34] tell us who is this false
[58:36] prophet, he must send a
[58:42] prophet. This
[58:44] place is for the
[58:49] redeemed. He said the name of the Lord
[58:54] is a mighty tower.
[58:58] the Russians
[59:00] because we know we are going to die. We
[59:05] must run to the place of
[59:11] rest and
[59:14] comfort
[59:16] because we are living in this
[59:19] body but we are not this
[59:22] body. When this body's time has has has
[59:29] expired. But you you must have a place
[59:33] of
[59:34] rest. This body one of the good days
[59:39] it's going to be is going to
[59:43] expire. The Bible says we know they're
[59:47] going to
[59:48] die. But a person
[59:51] inside is not going to die.
[59:54] But when he moves from this one,
[59:58] because when you are sick,
[1:00:02] sickness is the sign of the wall
[1:00:10] creaking. In other words, the wall of
[1:00:13] your house which you are
[1:00:17] in is creaking little by
[1:00:21] little. When you when you feel pain,
[1:00:24] That wall is
[1:00:27] creaking. That wall is
[1:00:30] creaking. Then until when you look at
[1:00:34] the wall, you find this wall has many
[1:00:39] character on me. Then you you get out
[1:00:44] of when you get out of the house, people
[1:00:47] say you are dead. No, you are not dead.
[1:00:51] You have seen that this
[1:00:53] house is is has
[1:00:56] expired going to fall on me to get out.
[1:01:00] But when you get out of
[1:01:02] this, you must go to a
[1:01:05] place of
[1:01:07] peace and
[1:01:11] rest where you are going to be
[1:01:13] comforted.
[1:01:15] Isaiah says here, "You will be
[1:01:19] comforted like a person who is comforted
[1:01:22] by his mother,
[1:01:25] but you'll be
[1:01:26] comforted in Jerusalem." Jerusalem.
[1:01:29] Comfort is in Jerusalem.
[1:01:34] The name of the Lord is a mighty
[1:01:41] tower. I will come back here.
[1:01:46] Jerusalem. Jerusalem. We have got the
[1:01:51] Jerusalem which is the type of the
[1:01:53] heavenly
[1:01:55] Jerusalem and the heavenly
[1:01:58] Jerusalem here as we are living when we
[1:02:02] read the book of Hebrews chapter
[1:02:07] 12 and um I I don't know I want water.
[1:02:14] But let's read the book of Hebrews
[1:02:17] chapter 12
[1:02:20] 12 verse ah brother they will they will
[1:02:24] try to fetch water. Amen. Verse
[1:02:27] 21 12. Amen. And so terrible was the
[1:02:33] sight that Moses said I exceedingly
[1:02:37] fear. Hebrews chapter 12. Yes.
[1:02:42] One. All right, start from verse 22.
[1:02:44] Let's see. 22.
[1:02:47] But ye are come unto Mount Zion, and
[1:02:50] unto the city of the living God, the
[1:02:53] heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
[1:02:56] innumerable company of angels,
[1:02:59] the the Jerus the earthly Jerusalem,
[1:03:03] Jerusalem types the heavenly
[1:03:06] Jerusalem. And the heavenly
[1:03:09] Jerusalem, as Paul is telling us here,
[1:03:12] He was telling the Hebrews and he's
[1:03:15] telling us that you have come into that
[1:03:20] city the heavenly Jerusalem.
[1:03:23] In other words, the church, the bride
[1:03:28] because the angel said to
[1:03:30] John, "John, I'm going to show you the
[1:03:34] bride, the lamb's wife."
[1:03:37] When John went
[1:03:39] out to see the lamb's
[1:03:43] wife, the new
[1:03:45] city, he sent him from
[1:03:48] heaven. The
[1:03:49] city is the is the wife of the
[1:03:54] lamb, the the the church, the bride is
[1:04:01] Jerusalem. Jerusalem.
[1:04:03] Amen. Amen. And then Jerusalem which is
[1:04:07] the
[1:04:08] bride is the body of
[1:04:12] Christ. Then when they
[1:04:15] say the the name of the Lord is a mighty
[1:04:21] tower it means the
[1:04:25] body because the name is Jesus Christ.
[1:04:30] The name of the Lord is
[1:04:32] Jesus. It's the Lord Jesus Christ. When
[1:04:35] they say the name of the Lord is a
[1:04:37] mighty
[1:04:38] name, it means the name the Lord Jesus
[1:04:43] Christ to that
[1:04:45] name. Then you will find
[1:04:48] peace, rest and comfort. Jesus said,
[1:04:53] "Come unto me. If you are
[1:04:56] tired, he will give you
[1:04:58] rest. He said he is the rest. Then when
[1:05:02] you get to him, then you find the rest.
[1:05:06] The the name of the Lord is a mighty
[1:05:11] tower. The Bible says Jesus is the head
[1:05:16] and the church is the body. In other
[1:05:19] words, the head and the body is one.
[1:05:23] In other words, the church is Jesus
[1:05:26] Christ because you can't have Jesus the
[1:05:30] head. If the head is Jesus,
[1:05:34] then the Buddh is Jesus. That's why Paul
[1:05:38] when he's starting to build a
[1:05:40] church the church of the from the
[1:05:43] Gentiles he said I am going to call
[1:05:47] people
[1:05:49] for God's
[1:05:50] name in other words those people who
[1:05:54] will come they will be in in the name of
[1:05:58] the
[1:05:59] Lord in other words their names will be
[1:06:02] Jesus
[1:06:05] Christ is the body of the Lord. Jesus
[1:06:08] said this his church is his
[1:06:13] body and his body
[1:06:18] is they say you run into the
[1:06:23] house and that house is a mighty
[1:06:27] town and that house is the Lord Jesus
[1:06:31] Christ. His church
[1:06:33] is his house.
[1:06:36] And if you run to his
[1:06:38] church, his house,
[1:06:44] are you together with us here? Amen.
[1:06:46] Then he his his church here.
[1:06:51] If you if you are one of the
[1:06:54] redeemed, his church is formed by his
[1:07:00] redeemed. If you are his
[1:07:03] redeemed part of his
[1:07:06] church and to be part of his
[1:07:09] church, you must be born
[1:07:12] again. And to be born
[1:07:15] again, all right. Amen.
[1:07:19] Are you together with me?
[1:07:24] To be born
[1:07:26] again, you
[1:07:28] must receive the seat.
[1:07:37] Seat and the
[1:07:39] seat travels through the
[1:07:43] body. The seat from
[1:07:47] God came to
[1:07:49] Phillip which is the body which is part
[1:07:53] of the
[1:07:55] body. Philillip Philip which is part of
[1:07:58] the body
[1:08:00] carried the
[1:08:01] seat to the
[1:08:06] unic and there was birth
[1:08:10] there because the seed came there.
[1:08:14] through Philip.
[1:08:16] The Bible says you are born again
[1:08:21] through the living seat
[1:08:24] which is the word of
[1:08:26] God. In other words,
[1:08:28] birth comes through the
[1:08:31] word and Bible says how can he preach.
[1:08:37] In other words, we cannot know his
[1:08:39] name because he says those who call upon
[1:08:43] the name of the
[1:08:44] Lord shall be saved because the name of
[1:08:48] the Lord is a mighty tower. The
[1:08:51] righteous run
[1:08:53] into call upon the name
[1:08:56] of shall be saved. He says now how can
[1:09:01] they call
[1:09:02] upon if there is no picture? How can he
[1:09:08] preach if there is no if he is not
[1:09:11] sent? That's why when he's building his
[1:09:16] church through seven church
[1:09:18] agents he had seven
[1:09:21] messengers we shall call seven
[1:09:25] spiritual that's why the Bible
[1:09:28] says how can they how can they
[1:09:32] preach if they are not
[1:09:34] sent and the prophet said these seven
[1:09:39] messengers are making God known to the
[1:09:44] people. In other words, you cannot know
[1:09:46] God if there is no
[1:09:50] messenger that these messengers came to
[1:09:53] make God known to
[1:09:58] us. How can they preach if they are not
[1:10:01] sent?
[1:10:03] He said as the father has sent
[1:10:07] me so I send
[1:10:10] you in each and every
[1:10:14] age there were
[1:10:17] messenger there was a
[1:10:19] messenger in this
[1:10:21] age under that
[1:10:24] messenger let me tell
[1:10:26] you God predestinate these seven church
[1:10:30] ages
[1:10:34] when he's calling the gentile
[1:10:37] church which is the new
[1:10:41] Jerusalem when he's when he's building
[1:10:43] his
[1:10:44] church which is the new Jerusalem he
[1:10:47] used seven
[1:10:50] messenger and in each
[1:10:56] messenger they were predestinated
[1:10:58] pastors
[1:11:01] Because this messenger is a
[1:11:03] predestinated
[1:11:05] messenger and under this predestinated
[1:11:09] messenger
[1:11:12] predestinated and under this
[1:11:14] predestinated
[1:11:16] pastor predestinated sheep.
[1:11:20] [Applause]
[1:11:21] [Music]
[1:11:22] There won't be a
[1:11:24] pastor if there are no
[1:11:27] sheep because he is a
[1:11:30] shepherd. How can he be a
[1:11:32] shepherd if there are no
[1:11:37] sheep? Amen. Because the Bible says in
[1:11:41] the olden
[1:11:43] time when when they were branding the
[1:11:49] sheep, they were the the brand they were
[1:11:53] branding the sheep. The mark they were
[1:11:54] putting
[1:11:56] on. They were putting also in the hand
[1:11:59] of the
[1:12:01] shepherd. In other words, the mark in
[1:12:04] the
[1:12:05] sheep must appear also in the hand
[1:12:10] In other the the sheep the
[1:12:12] sheep and the shepherd are
[1:12:16] one they've got the same
[1:12:20] mark. If this sheep cannot follow the
[1:12:25] shepherd means it is not
[1:12:27] part of this
[1:12:31] ministry of this shepherd.
[1:12:34] The B the prophet says leave it because
[1:12:38] it is a
[1:12:45] goat and God has predestinated these
[1:12:48] seven church
[1:12:51] agent this
[1:12:53] messenger will call this
[1:12:57] people. He knew the number of them. He
[1:13:01] knew their names.
[1:13:04] because their names were in
[1:13:09] his in that book of
[1:13:11] redemption. Your names were
[1:13:14] there. When he was sitting there with a
[1:13:17] book in his
[1:13:18] hand, your names were there.
[1:13:22] knew this this group of
[1:13:26] names this this messenger
[1:13:31] will be responsible for this
[1:13:33] group. So under this
[1:13:36] messenger will be these
[1:13:38] pastors who will be
[1:13:41] taught
[1:13:43] faithfully from
[1:13:46] this take from the
[1:13:48] messenger pass it to the sheep.
[1:13:52] In whatever the sheep are
[1:13:55] hearing, the messenger has
[1:13:58] said, they hear what the messengers
[1:14:02] have
[1:14:06] said. They recognize
[1:14:10] God. The pastors must must recognize God
[1:14:14] in the messengers.
[1:14:17] the sheep. My god in their
[1:14:23] past because when as as my my elder
[1:14:29] said, if you accepted the word of
[1:14:32] God, the word of God in
[1:14:35] you makes you a minor God.
[1:14:41] That's
[1:14:42] why the sheep in Paul's
[1:14:46] style the Paul says they glorified
[1:14:50] God in
[1:14:54] me. Perhaps if it was during this
[1:15:00] time what is this pastor
[1:15:02] saying we glorified God in him.
[1:15:08] We are leaving him. But Paul said they
[1:15:11] glorified
[1:15:13] God. He has seen them glorifying
[1:15:17] God and glorifying God in
[1:15:21] him. That's why they could come with
[1:15:25] handkerchiefs and put them on the boot
[1:15:27] of Paul and go back home and put them in
[1:15:31] the sick
[1:15:34] people because they have identified
[1:15:38] in this
[1:15:39] man. People who fail to identify God,
[1:15:44] they are the one who stand in the way of
[1:15:46] those who see
[1:15:52] God because they don't have eyes to see.
[1:15:57] When you see they say you don't
[1:16:02] see they think you are like them.
[1:16:07] The Bible said where we have read,
[1:16:11] he said I I saw the
[1:16:15] city and I saw a new
[1:16:19] heaven and a new
[1:16:22] earth. So the first
[1:16:24] heaven and the first
[1:16:27] earth
[1:16:30] away there was no more
[1:16:35] sin. That's why why why there will be no
[1:16:40] mercy? Because
[1:16:43] Satan will never be
[1:16:45] there. He he operate in the
[1:16:50] sea because the sea will be no
[1:16:54] more. He will never be
[1:16:57] there. Where will he operate?
[1:17:00] The Bible
[1:17:01] says and
[1:17:03] I so the city the new
[1:17:07] Jerusalem coming down from
[1:17:10] God because you are
[1:17:16] joys and
[1:17:19] spiritual and the church of God is both
[1:17:23] physical and
[1:17:25] spiritual when we see you here you are
[1:17:29] somewhere
[1:17:32] when you come together that's why the
[1:17:35] prophet says when you come to the
[1:17:38] service your theophan is
[1:17:41] come take the place
[1:17:45] there you must move you you must move
[1:17:48] with the
[1:17:48] message because the word of God is a
[1:17:52] seat because the seat in
[1:17:55] it has got life in it when Put it down
[1:18:00] there. It will it must germinate.
[1:18:04] When it germinate it it it look it does
[1:18:08] not look like the seed you have
[1:18:11] planted but it is the same
[1:18:14] seed. But if you don't know you never
[1:18:17] know that this is the
[1:18:18] seed but it's another
[1:18:22] dispensation of the same seat. The life
[1:18:25] of the seed is in
[1:18:27] that it will
[1:18:29] move until it comes to the seat
[1:18:35] again. We are living at the sea
[1:18:38] time. We are not living in a blade
[1:18:44] time or shak age but we are living in
[1:18:48] the
[1:18:51] sea. When the seat has come
[1:18:55] No more rain is needed.
[1:19:00] Even even the the
[1:19:02] farmers they will try to destroy clouds.
[1:19:06] When they see the clouds they try to
[1:19:09] destroy because the seed has
[1:19:11] come. What is needed
[1:19:14] there? The shack the sun
[1:19:18] there. The the the function of the sun
[1:19:21] is to bend the
[1:19:24] shack so that the shark can open
[1:19:28] itself. So that the seat can come in
[1:19:31] contact with
[1:19:33] the
[1:19:35] people leave you is because they are the
[1:19:40] shark. They must leave so that you must
[1:19:44] stand in in in the presence of the
[1:19:46] shark.
[1:19:53] I saw the city, the new Jerusalem.
[1:19:57] It's the city Abraham was looking
[1:19:59] for. He saw that city there. He thought
[1:20:03] it was
[1:20:06] somewhere. He was moving from country to
[1:20:09] country looking for this city which is
[1:20:12] the city of
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:16] rest the city of rest
[1:20:19] peace and
[1:20:21] comfort because in verse four
[1:20:24] here and God shall wipe away all
[1:20:29] tears. You must go to that
[1:20:32] city so that you can sleep there.
[1:20:37] When you sleep, you must sleep at that
[1:20:40] city in that
[1:20:43] name because the this city is the bride
[1:20:47] of Jesus Christ and the bride of Jesus
[1:20:51] Christ as the name of his
[1:20:55] husband because the name of the husband
[1:20:58] is taken by the wife. The wife
[1:21:03] acquired the name of his husband.
[1:21:07] And the the name of Jesus is with the
[1:21:13] bride. He says here when you die, you
[1:21:18] must die in that
[1:21:21] city. You must die in that
[1:21:24] body. You must die in that
[1:21:27] house because the church is the
[1:21:30] house is the body of Jesus Christ. He is
[1:21:34] the head when you die there. I said to
[1:21:38] to to be the
[1:21:40] member you must be born again. But if
[1:21:43] you are not born
[1:21:44] again, you will die
[1:21:48] twice. You understand? When I say you
[1:21:50] die
[1:21:51] twice, I say you die twice because you
[1:21:54] are born
[1:21:58] dead then you you are living dead.
[1:22:04] until you die. Your last
[1:22:08] death is at the white throne
[1:22:12] judgment is the second death. The first
[1:22:16] death is when you are born. You are
[1:22:20] dead. When you move outside of this
[1:22:23] body, you are not dead.
[1:22:27] You are dead when you separate with
[1:22:31] God. Because by
[1:22:33] birth, separated with
[1:22:36] God, there is no life in you because
[1:22:39] life is
[1:22:40] God. Let's stand
[1:22:43] [Applause]
[1:22:50] up. Let's close our eyes.
[1:22:56] Mighty heavenly father, the father of
[1:23:00] our lord Jesus Christ,
[1:23:03] we are
[1:23:05] here, we have seated
[1:23:08] down and listened to the word.
[1:23:14] We know always when a word is
[1:23:17] preached, Satan sometimes wanted to find
[1:23:20] the corner
[1:23:22] where he can throw
[1:23:25] something which is not from you.
[1:23:28] But always we believe that because these
[1:23:31] are your
[1:23:32] children only what is from you is what
[1:23:37] will stay and find the place in their
[1:23:43] soul. We are going to get out of this
[1:23:48] place go to our different places to go
[1:23:51] and rest a bit.
[1:23:54] Be with the family.
[1:23:57] Be with them.
[1:24:00] You
[1:24:01] are the savior.
[1:24:04] Paul
[1:24:06] said, "You are the comforter."
[1:24:10] He said to the people, "We will comfort
[1:24:14] you with the comfort
[1:24:17] we were comforted with.
[1:24:20] We are trying to comfort these people
[1:24:23] with the comfort God has comforted us
[1:24:26] with.
[1:24:28] Be with them. Comfort them with your
[1:24:31] word. We pray,
[1:24:35] Father. We
[1:24:37] know what we are asking.
[1:24:40] You have already known that we are going
[1:24:43] to ask it.
[1:24:45] You have just waited for us to utter
[1:24:48] them with our mouth. We have uttered
[1:24:51] them. Lord, bring it. We pray. We pray
[1:24:55] in the precious name of our Lord and
[1:24:57] Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:24:59] Amen. God bless you.
[1:25:02] [Applause]
[1:25:05] Um

[1:25:52] right
[1:25:53] place? Amen. Under the right ministry.

[1:26:00] pastor.
