[6:43] foreign
[6:45] [Music]
[7:20] foreign
[7:23] [Music]
[7:46] [Music]
[7:57] [Applause]
[7:58] [Music]
[8:05] States
[8:07] Jesus Christ
[8:09] [Music]
[9:23] they don't give me
[9:27] myself
[9:29] [Music]
[9:38] [Applause]
[9:41] [Music]
[9:52] thank you
[9:57] amen
[10:00] I would like to greet you all
[10:03] brothers and sisters in the precious
[10:06] name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[10:11] I am the MC of the day
[10:14] before maybe we could
[10:17] start with our program let me just
[10:21] point out some few
[10:24] hints
[10:26] the the
[10:28] regulations in different places are not
[10:31] the same
[10:32] this place here is a plot
[10:35] being applaud now before we
[10:39] start with our
[10:42] preparations for this event
[10:46] we had to go around the neighbors making
[10:49] them aware that
[10:50] we will be having
[10:52] uh a day like this
[10:56] where will be
[10:58] dedicating this
[11:00] plot
[11:02] so
[11:03] you know we've got some different
[11:05] nationalities you know what's going on
[11:07] then we had to go to the police station
[11:10] also
[11:11] to inform them that we'll be having this
[11:13] because at the moment we don't have a
[11:16] permit that we can have an event in this
[11:19] place before you could have an event you
[11:22] must have a payment
[11:24] so now because we want to dedicate this
[11:27] place we just went around so the
[11:31] neighbors were very very kind to me
[11:34] and they supported us 100 percent
[11:38] and they even
[11:41] threw our guards here
[11:45] and brother knowledge
[11:48] they know them and they trust them
[11:52] so they even
[11:54] assured me that they will put me on
[11:57] their WhatsApp group
[11:59] so then the only thing that we need to
[12:02] be careful about
[12:04] is to make unnecessary noise because
[12:06] they said no everybody up to seeing
[12:10] everybody have to make noise some time
[12:12] but it should not be
[12:15] uh a continuous noise whereby at a
[12:20] certain time when they want to relax
[12:22] they should be disturbance but they are
[12:24] good neighbors okay that's all so now we
[12:28] are about to start with our program in
[12:30] our program
[12:31] we have some few items before we call
[12:34] the pasta
[12:36] uh

[12:53] you can't
[12:55] lie is here
[12:57] okay let's give a chance to our sister
[13:00] just to give us that solo I don't know
[13:03] where they solo you know how you've done
[13:05] it God bless you the sister let's just

[16:49] We are continuing so our neighbors
[16:54] are not here but
[16:58] they just gave me a message that I must

[18:55] we have here
[18:57] a speaker
[18:59] on behalf of their neighbors since their
[19:02] neighbors are not here
[19:04] the neighbors that were very really
[19:07] active is their neighbor that site it's
[19:11] a sister Pam
[19:13] we were with her yesterday
[19:16] so she also says thumb up then what she
[19:19] said she said now we need a church next
[19:23] to us
[19:24] and we need a pastor that will always go
[19:27] to him and let him pray for our problems
[19:31] because there's a lot of burglary in
[19:33] this place
[19:34] so that was a thumper up and then our
[19:38] other neighbors that site is Magda
[19:41] so he's the one she's the one that gave
[19:44] me books then she said no she's very
[19:47] happy
[19:48] about
[19:50] what is going to happen it's just that
[19:52] now she cannot be with us but she's
[19:55] supporting us 100 percent
[19:57] and she's a very supporting neighbor
[20:00] actually brother Victoria

[20:29] and if a dog is sick she'll be the one
[20:34] that will notice that that dog is sick
[20:36] take it to the vet

[22:55] precious brother tagani Pilla

[27:41] prayers
[27:43] shallow
[27:44] [Applause]
[27:59] [Music]
[28:03] thank you breneo I made a previous
[28:08] mistake
[28:10] until brother Monday came and showed me
[28:13] that
[28:14] I have
[28:16] jumped a very very important item
[28:22] um
[28:26] [Laughter]
[28:28] I overlooked
[28:31] he was supposed to give us a welcome
[28:35] speech
[28:36] [Music]
[28:38] will you will forgive me for that come
[28:40] my brother God bless you
[28:42] amen
[28:50] foreign
[28:59] I would like to
[29:01] greet
[29:04] the pride of Christ in the most
[29:06] wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[29:09] I like to create faster makua
[29:12] in our midst
[29:14] and also create our Joshua of this hour
[29:17] of this age
[29:19] Hallelujah
[29:20] we are happy to have him Barcelona with
[29:23] us
[29:24] because every time when he preaches
[29:27] I always feel my spirit that he is
[29:30] getting it directly from God Amen so I
[29:34] just want to
[29:36] say something just few words
[29:39] as I've been requested Hallelujah
[29:43] to bring that dedication ceremony speech
[29:46] or a welcoming speech rather
[29:49] but before maybe I can start I just want
[29:52] to say this that I remember the day when
[29:54] our pastor came to my house to dedicate
[29:57] my house amen
[30:01] we were having enemies but we didn't
[30:03] know that we had enemies
[30:06] until after the dedication that's when
[30:08] we realized because
[30:10] because whatever the devil was hiding it
[30:13] came up
[30:15] now you know the Bible says you you need
[30:17] to know that you are not fighting
[30:19] against
[30:20] the Flesh and Blood Allelujah but we are
[30:23] fighting against the spiritual spirits
[30:29] so when we find out about that and then
[30:31] I knew in my prayer that how am I gonna
[30:34] pray
[30:36] because the Bible says we need to love
[30:38] them amen
[30:40] if they do you wrong you must do them
[30:43] right
[30:44] Hallelujah
[30:46] amen
[30:50] so now as we are in this ceremony
[30:54] where our pastor will be dedication
[30:56] dedicating this land
[30:58] in my spirit
[31:00] there was this uh scripture normally the
[31:03] pastor would like to quote
[31:07] when Moses were crossing the Red Sea
[31:11] it was such a hard thing to them
[31:14] Farah was coming behind them
[31:17] in front of them there was a sea that
[31:21] they need to cross
[31:23] but there's something that God said
[31:26] to them that go forward
[31:30] Hallelujah
[31:32] so where we are I know that every time
[31:35] when God gives something the devil will
[31:38] try to bring tactics
[31:40] will try to stand against it but there's
[31:44] one thing that I know that
[31:46] the Egyptians that you saw you shall see
[31:49] them no more
[31:51] Hallelujah
[31:52] so that's where we are now
[31:56] the Lord shall fight
[31:58] for us hallelujah
[32:00] but for us we shall just hold our peace
[32:04] Hallelujah the fight is not ours
[32:07] even the fighting that we are facing is
[32:09] not yours
[32:10] because when you fight back we are
[32:12] opening doors
[32:14] for the devil to come in
[32:16] Hallelujah in the Bible says we mustn't
[32:19] give the devil any
[32:22] Place Hallelujah because it will be hard
[32:24] to take him out
[32:26] because already he's got a place amen
[32:29] now this is a welcoming speech I've just
[32:34] saw some quotes from our prophet
[32:38] that I would like to quote them while
[32:42] I'm doing the welcoming speech
[32:44] in this Baza one I'm welcoming each and
[32:47] every one of us
[32:48] Hallelujah
[32:50] and also the spirit of God who is within
[32:53] us
[32:54] we'd like to thank God that we are not
[32:56] alone but we are
[32:58] going together with our
[33:01] seven seal Hallelujah in the third pool
[33:03] amen
[33:05] now Prada pranam is saying here
[33:08] when we in fellowship with God we don't
[33:11] have to worry about anything
[33:14] Hallelujah God will care and provide all
[33:18] we need for this journey
[33:21] so we don't have to worry about anything
[33:24] Hallelujah God is our provider
[33:27] already as I've said that what happened
[33:30] in my house I can imagine what will
[33:32] happen in this place
[33:34] Hallelujah
[33:35] because as the pastor
[33:38] will come and dedicate there are things
[33:41] that are going to happen
[33:42] Hallelujah I'm talking about spiritual
[33:45] things because when things sometimes are
[33:47] not working out you don't have to look
[33:49] them in a physical side but you need to
[33:53] understand that this is a spiritual
[33:54] world
[33:55] Hallelujah
[33:56] and when things are not going right
[33:58] physically you need to understand
[34:00] there's something wrong spiritually
[34:02] so what you need to do you need to fix
[34:06] spiritually
[34:08] then the download will come into your
[34:10] physical
[34:11] Hallelujah
[34:12] so now there is a verse that I want to
[34:15] read just to read it blesses me so much
[34:18] and I believe that it also gonna bless
[34:21] you as I welcome everybody Amen in the
[34:26] Book of Psalms 92 12 to 15 it says
[34:30] because now as we are here hallelujah
[34:34] this is going to be a land we are going
[34:36] to build in the Tabernacle of God Amen
[34:39] and also there are people there's a
[34:43] pride of God that will be there
[34:45] but this is what David is saying in the
[34:47] Book of Psalms the Russians shall
[34:50] flourish
[34:51] like the palm tree
[34:54] they shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon
[34:58] in other words when we are here
[35:00] hallelujah and we are righteous
[35:03] something short is going to happen
[35:05] spiritually
[35:07] those that are planted in the house of
[35:10] the Lord shall flourish
[35:12] in the court of our God
[35:16] now this one it blesses me so much it
[35:19] says
[35:20] they shall still bring forth fruits in
[35:24] their old age
[35:25] Hallelujah
[35:28] when I see
[35:30] our old age who are with us
[35:34] you could see that probably they are
[35:37] aging physically but spiritually
[35:41] Hallelujah they are bringing forth
[35:45] fresh fruits
[35:46] [Music]
[35:49] I remember the other day when he had his
[35:52] birthday
[35:53] he said that he sometimes surprised when
[35:57] he come to
[35:58] maybe a stop when he's driving maybe the
[36:01] police will come to him
[36:03] and they will say to him an old man
[36:08] he would like to see him like say what

[45:23] the time the hard work the dedication
[45:26] you've given in all the tasks that you
[45:28] were given may God bless you amen
[45:31] I'm here to update you on the status of
[45:35] things
[45:36] from the time we started up until now
[45:40] the reason I'm doing this it is because
[45:42] I want everyone
[45:45] in this place
[45:47] amen to know where we are
[45:50] to know where we're coming from
[45:53] to know where we are going amen
[45:56] I want us to close the gap I want us to
[46:00] close any vacuum amen I want you to be
[46:03] the people who will represent the
[46:05] committee I don't want anyone when it is
[46:08] asked and now everyone will just throw
[46:10] hands in the air and say I don't know
[46:12] what they're doing I'm here to tell you
[46:13] as the chairperson where we are where
[46:16] we're coming from and where we are going
[46:19] amen so that we all are in the same
[46:22] place
[46:24] amen
[46:26] same place
[46:28] same baptism single understanding same
[46:32] Faith all
[46:34] same amen
[46:37] when the committee was appointed by the
[46:40] body and the pastor
[46:43] we are all very much excited
[46:46] excited by the Mandate given to us
[46:50] because already we could Envision a
[46:54] church standing in this place
[46:57] Hallelujah
[46:58] this was the time when you were coming
[47:00] from Birchwood when we would have
[47:03] conferences and we would have like lots
[47:07] of
[47:08] um spend lots of money on on on
[47:10] Beachwood amen so we actually was
[47:15] looking forward to to to having our own
[47:18] Birchwood amen and that was the vibe at
[47:21] that time to say we need to have our own
[47:24] Birchwood amen so
[47:29] maybe even before let me start by saying
[47:32] just to tell you about this place a
[47:34] little bit
[47:35] is that this place was found by that
[47:39] area
[47:42] found this place and approached the
[47:45] pastor and approached the board to say
[47:48] hey there is a place that I have found
[47:51] and I think it could be a good place for
[47:54] the church
[47:55] and the pastor and the boat looked at it
[47:57] and they saw that it was actually a good
[48:01] place amen so I just want you to not to
[48:05] forget
[48:06] that it was entitled
[48:08] who introduced this place to us as the
[48:12] church and the board and the pastor at
[48:16] large amen so
[48:18] he is with us
[48:22] he is listening
[48:26] in the dimension
[48:28] may God bless you masalani
[48:31] so we then impact as the committee I
[48:34] told you we were excited we embarked on
[48:37] a process which I call it a consultation
[48:40] process where we consulted certain
[48:43] members of the church to try and come up
[48:46] with a wish list
[48:49] a wish is to say in a church the pastor
[48:52] always complains about the cables that
[48:55] the cables must run under a tunnel there
[48:57] must be this there must be this so that
[48:59] you know we get our chest to be a
[49:03] perfect church so we compiled a wish
[49:06] list Hallelujah it is that wish list
[49:09] that we were going to use to consult
[49:13] with the architects so that we tell the
[49:16] Architects to say Architects this is
[49:18] what we want and therefore you must come
[49:21] to our plot so that you can see what we
[49:24] want and then give us a plan a design
[49:27] but this is our wish list amen
[49:31] but then
[49:35] the process started we call the
[49:37] Architects we believe them on what we're
[49:39] looking for and they were quantity
[49:42] surveyors that came here to physically
[49:44] see what is on the ground so that they
[49:47] can come up with desired designs and we
[49:50] received beautiful designs masalani and
[49:53] beautiful quotations to build a church
[49:56] amen that almost every member had some
[49:59] form of input in it amen and it was as I
[50:04] indicated it was very exciting but this
[50:07] is what I want to tell you about
[50:08] navigation
[50:09] we in fact saw ourselves
[50:12] as more of a committee that was going to
[50:15] assist in fundraising efforts to get
[50:19] this church built
[50:22] our our our
[50:25] understanding of the Mandate was that we
[50:28] were going to come bring our expertise
[50:29] and look at ways wherein we can actually
[50:32] get this church to be built by looking
[50:35] at fundraising and all that
[50:39] but
[50:40] there came a turning point in our
[50:43] committee where we had to do a 360
[50:46] degree about 10.
[50:49] and start the process of getting this
[50:52] place rezoned for worship
[50:57] because all along the narrative was
[51:00] the place was a
[51:02] was already zoned so we were only coming
[51:06] in to assist in making sure that we get
[51:10] the building erected and getting but we
[51:13] got a shock of Our Lives when we learned
[51:15] in the process
[51:17] and when we get the rezoning certificate
[51:19] that this place this beautiful place has
[51:23] not been rezoned so now we had to like
[51:26] make a 10 about a 362 360 Degrees to
[51:33] start the process of rezoning this place
[51:37] all of us
[51:39] we did not have the experience of
[51:41] rezoning
[51:43] especially for a church of this
[51:46] magnitude so now we had to pause a bit
[51:50] on the architectural side of things and
[51:54] start to chase the rezoning process
[51:56] because that one cannot do before this
[51:59] one
[52:00] amen
[52:02] so
[52:06] we started to engage with the city of
[52:08] China I was going with the the way
[52:12] and then they actually encouraged us to
[52:15] appoint a consulting firm that will help
[52:18] us with the processes because these are
[52:20] the companies that does this all the
[52:22] time and they know the ins and outs then
[52:25] we appointed a company called Gap
[52:28] developments as the Consultants
[52:30] or as our Consultants amen so after
[52:34] several engagements with gap
[52:36] developments back and forth we were able
[52:39] to launch an application to get this
[52:42] place resolved in 2018.
[52:46] amen
[52:47] now as we did that to an responded to
[52:52] our application and then they said we
[52:56] needed to do investigations we need to
[52:59] do that to do studies that should
[53:01] accompany the application amen so there
[53:05] has to be an investigation on the roads
[53:08] and stormwater
[53:09] there has to be investigation on the
[53:12] flat line so the drawings that you do
[53:15] must not be on the flat line the flat
[53:17] line must even the parking must not be
[53:19] on the flat line so it means a surveyors
[53:22] must come here and make a drawing that
[53:25] actually fits into those so that when
[53:27] you do your investigation your report
[53:29] sticks to to the parameters that the
[53:33] city requires amen the topographical
[53:37] survey a traffic impact assessment
[53:40] report bulk services that is the water
[53:43] the section 7 report how trans GLS
[53:47] report mahalis Water Report amen all
[53:51] these studies as we're doing them they
[53:53] needed to be paid so all along the trust
[53:57] is when this report was required the
[53:59] trustees would pay when this report was
[54:02] required the trustees would pay and
[54:04] thanks to you trustees because it will
[54:06] not be have been possible if it was not
[54:09] through do your support amen
[54:13] now
[54:17] the period you're with me again
[54:22] so that when I tell you we are here and
[54:25] then this is where we are going so that
[54:26] we are all together amen now
[54:29] the period it takes for a report like
[54:33] for example if there is a traffic impact
[54:35] study there has to be people that come
[54:38] here and look at the cars that passes at
[54:42] various times or various peak times to
[54:45] to to to to look at the impact
[54:49] or the impact of the flow on the flow of
[54:53] traffic this establishment would do so
[54:58] there is all so and all these reports
[55:01] they go to various
[55:03] divisions within the city
[55:07] and they don't go to a single individual
[55:09] they go to this one and they go to this
[55:11] one and those people they need to
[55:13] respond with comments and those comments
[55:17] must go to the consult the consultant so
[55:20] that they can adapt the application to
[55:23] suit the comments that they are making
[55:25] amen now
[55:28] if there's one report that I want to
[55:30] particularly bring your attention to
[55:33] is the traffic impact assessment report
[55:36] now that is the report I just told you
[55:38] about now when this report was done the
[55:41] city of tshwanee was very happy with our
[55:43] report amen but because this traffic
[55:48] or the road this road is not the rotia
[55:52] city it's the road here the Department
[55:54] of Transport so the city must take the
[55:58] report to the city to the gauten traffic
[56:03] Road and transport to make a
[56:06] determination as well now
[56:09] here we found a big challenge because we
[56:14] waited for almost almost a year
[56:17] because we would send emails we would do
[56:20] this nothing happens and it came last I
[56:24] think towards the uh at the beginning of
[56:29] 2020 that's when we got a respond from
[56:32] the roads and traffic department and
[56:36] they also had comments amen
[56:39] I'm happy to report to you that all the
[56:42] reports the investigation has been done
[56:45] to date and the only thing that is left
[56:47] for us is to get together zoning is to
[56:50] comply with the comments that delayed
[56:53] and that came through the roads
[56:55] Department amen
[56:57] now I want to take you through the
[57:00] comments by the Department of Roads
[57:02] they are saying as you can see this main
[57:04] road it's a it's a busy road they're
[57:07] actually saying we need to have a big
[57:11] traffic second
[57:13] erected on that road okay and then have
[57:18] another a traffic circle that comes
[57:21] through the gate here that is the
[57:24] recommendation and that is the condition
[57:26] before we result before they give a a a
[57:31] a because and it hopefully it comes from
[57:34] the the their impact assessment studies
[57:38] now
[57:41] they also say this route it's called
[57:44] bergroot if I'm correct
[57:47] this bear fruit is too narrow yeah
[57:52] so we need to expand it so now it means
[57:57] we need to go to the neighborhood
[58:00] which we have done and the neighbor has
[58:03] agreed to give us a space
[58:11] and then
[58:14] when we were busy with with with with
[58:16] the neighbor so that we can now register
[58:19] a servitude when you do that you must
[58:22] have the servitude registered in other
[58:24] level you will understand that that
[58:26] process you'll you need to have a
[58:28] Solitude registered in favor so that
[58:31] when that person sells that Solitude
[58:33] will remain for everyone that is using
[58:36] this road amen now
[58:39] as we were busy with the Solitude
[58:41] registration we got a challenge we got a
[58:45] challenge there was a hold or there was
[58:49] a
[58:50] they call it a covet or moratorium on
[58:53] the on the plot next door
[58:56] to say nothing must happen to that plot
[58:58] and now it was a hold at this office and
[59:02] therefore it will we had that challenge
[59:05] so we actually started with that process
[59:10] we we spoke to miss Fender Miss Fender
[59:13] that's the lady Pam uh was talking about
[59:17] she was very supportive
[59:19] and we continued with the lawyers
[59:22] and we managed you know I don't want to
[59:25] bore you with with all the the
[59:29] the
[59:29] you know the integrities of of of of of
[59:33] what we had to go through but let me
[59:35] just tell you that in that process we
[59:37] actually it took a bit of time it was
[59:39] almost a challenge for us but by the
[59:43] grace of God the other day I took in the
[59:46] Disco Center we went and saw the lady
[59:48] the lawyer who was helping us and then
[59:50] the lady went to the Deeds office and
[59:54] then he had to get a an order from the
[59:56] high court and now as we speak about two
[59:59] weeks or three weeks ago the high court
[1:00:02] gave an order to remove the hold
[1:00:06] now there is no more a hold
[1:00:12] therefore means we can go ahead with our
[1:00:16] arrangement with the lady
[1:00:18] now as we speak the lady has got the
[1:00:21] agreement which she must sign that this
[1:00:22] Persona gave it to her because we can or
[1:00:25] or a few days back the lady has to sign
[1:00:27] that
[1:00:29] agreement so that we can register a
[1:00:32] Savage route once the service shoot is
[1:00:34] registered it means now
[1:00:37] we have met all the conditions of
[1:00:41] reasoni Hallelujah and then from there
[1:00:44] on then we need to do the work
[1:00:47] we need to do the construction of the
[1:00:50] traffic second we need to do a traffic
[1:00:52] circle here we need to do the widening
[1:00:56] of the road as per the conditions they
[1:00:58] have put and there's a few with regards
[1:01:01] to the park services here because
[1:01:03] there'll be more people so it means even
[1:01:05] the services has to be enlarged a bit
[1:01:07] Hallelujah so where we are we are now at
[1:01:12] the pro or at the point where we are
[1:01:16] Consulting so that we can get an
[1:01:19] estimation
[1:01:20] an exact estimation of what is going to
[1:01:23] cost us to do this and all that and
[1:01:26] everything here to get this place or to
[1:01:29] meet all those conditions so that we can
[1:01:32] then go in and say now we're starting to
[1:01:35] put the first prick or go back to uh
[1:01:39] this process that we had started with
[1:01:41] initial and when that happens or after
[1:01:45] we have this estimate and everything as
[1:01:48] the committee we will go and meet the
[1:01:51] pastor will go and meet with the board
[1:01:53] and tell them what we have found what
[1:01:55] are the costs and what and then
[1:01:58] therefore a determination will be made
[1:02:00] when we have that amen
[1:02:02] foreign
[1:02:07] you
[1:02:10] I think I've just finalized a lot uh I
[1:02:14] must I Just Want to Thank You Believers
[1:02:17] for
