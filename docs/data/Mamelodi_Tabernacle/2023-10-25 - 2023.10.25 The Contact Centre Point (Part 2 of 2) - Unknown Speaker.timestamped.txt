[0:43] Eden with
[0:47] Adam was there
[0:50] [Music]
[0:52] mediator
[0:54] no it was God and his
[0:58] son
[1:01] [Music]
[1:03] and the Book of
[1:06] Luke
[1:09] chter I don't know 38 so it tell that
[1:15] Adam was the son of
[1:19] [Music]
[1:21] God Amen am
[1:25] okay let me read it for you Adam Adam
[1:30] was the son of
[1:33] God so he didn't need a
[1:38] [Music]
[1:40] mediator there was between
[1:48] [Music]
[1:56] and but after the
[1:58] sin
[2:01] then God brought in a
[2:08] mediator
[2:10] until the end of
[2:15] [Music]
[2:17] redemption
[2:19] right so I'm trying to read to
[2:22] you Luke 3:
[2:28] 38
[2:31] it's coming down of
[2:36] theology now here it says who was the
[2:39] son of Enos verse 38 Luke 3: 38 who was
[2:45] the son
[2:54] of So Adam was the son of not a not a
[2:59] son
[3:00] the Son of
[3:04] God then he
[3:07] fall he left the
[3:10] post amen so that's why
[3:14] God came down the seven
[3:21] steps he established seven steps for
[3:28] us okay
[3:31] now let's come here
[3:35] again now the prophet
[3:38] says God and man is now one
[3:43] [Music]
[3:46] here okay then he
[3:49] says he God don't just
[3:53] change it's God
[3:58] in is
[4:04] manifestation you can't call it
[4:07] manifestation until it is
[4:14] in that's then when it is
[4:20] manifestation you can't call it a
[4:22] revelation until God is
[4:26] in that's when we say it's a revelation
[4:32] you can't call it a fulfillment until
[4:34] that way is made
[4:38] flesh that's why it's called
[4:42] fulfillment before that it's not
[4:46] fulfill because it's not yet in
[4:52] flesh right now I'll read something here
[4:57] now when you reach the heart
[5:02] amen because we looking
[5:06] yesterday of how the seventh SE was
[5:14] open
[5:18] theeven open
[5:23] theal that's why
[5:27] it because it's the one that open
[5:33] the
[5:34] amen
[5:36] now
[5:38] we let's go down this
[5:41] way now I will read from the book the
[5:45] unity of one God in the one
[5:52] church because it also tells me that H
[5:58] when God comes to men com to
[6:03] [Music]
[6:06] their now we have two things
[6:12] here we have what we call
[6:17] men and we have what we call the
[6:24] [Music]
[6:26] heart searat
[6:28] them he
[6:30] says your soul in your
[6:34] heart another
[6:38] [Music]
[6:46] man amen so we read that
[6:50] yesterday the throne the third Throne is
[6:54] in your
[6:58] soul got nothing to do with this
[7:03] man this one is controlled by five
[7:09] senses
[7:11] sayses and blood shall not inherit theom
[7:17] [Music]
[7:20] of
[7:23] see Paul
[7:26] says there is another
[7:31] men and he says that man went to the
[7:35] third
[7:39] heaven and tell that was
[7:44] that the in part of
[7:50] Paul went to the
[7:55] [Music]
[7:57] thir this one is
[8:00] [Music]
[8:02] natural
[8:06] only that's why I can say to
[8:11] you I live in South Africa I live in
[8:15] South
[8:17] Africa my house is
[8:20] there but will you believe me if I say
[8:23] to you I can see my house right while
[8:26] standing
[8:28] here
[8:30] [Music]
[8:35] you don't
[8:37] believe that means you can't see your
[8:40] house and if you if you don't have a
[8:43] vision of your
[8:46] house afraid you are going to get lost
[8:49] when you
[8:53] leave because your house is programmed
[8:58] in you
[9:01] now you must take me to your house
[9:03] because it's not programmed in
[9:11] me if it's my first time to go to your
[9:15] house I need somebody to me
[9:20] there because it is not programmed in
[9:24] [Music]
[9:28] me
[9:29] can go to your house because it's
[9:32] programed in
[9:34] him that's how we are going to
[9:40] heaven you are to
[9:43] go something pred in
[9:47] you you know when Jesus was coming to
[9:51] John the Bible says John saw
[9:56] Jesus coming unto him because that thing
[10:04] wasam
[10:14] Mahan
[10:16] woman she said to
[10:19] Jesus I perceive you are a
[10:22] prophet and she went to tell the
[10:25] people and said come and see
[10:30] the who didn't see Jesus as the
[10:35] Mah but this
[10:37] woman recogniz
[10:40] Jesus as
[10:42] Mah say she had a
[10:49] representation she said I know the
[10:53] Messiah
[10:55] come and when he has come he he will
[10:59] tell us
[11:01] all and she was a
[11:04] prostitute while waiting for the
[11:07] Messiah and
[11:11] mahog the
[11:13] Messiah and protitution
[11:19] stopped so that thing
[11:22] was brother
[11:25] says God after he made you
[11:29] he has put a little Stone in
[11:33] you a little white
[11:36] stone so that in due
[11:40] time he will
[11:42] come and he will come to that
[11:47] stone and that stone will make a
[11:56] contact if you don't have that stone
[12:06] must something has put
[12:10] [Music]
[12:14] you when that woman met the Lord
[12:18] Jesus he says it was the two texts
[12:22] coming
[12:23] together two pieces of paper
[12:27] okay
[12:33] amen the Lord has one
[12:36] part and the woman had
[12:40] one so the Jesus comes with another
[12:45] part and it couldn't fit with
[12:54] a it couldn't Fe in the
[12:57] syue
[13:03] he that
[13:10] woman and she said to the people come
[13:15] and
[13:18] see all her problems were
[13:21] gone all her
[13:24] problems gone because she made
[13:32] cont you know how
[13:36] Paul when he was
[13:39] called his way to arrest the
[13:45] Christian amen and God made the road
[13:48] block for
[13:50] him and arrested
[13:53] him stopped him on
[13:57] his amen
[13:59] because he Paul made a contact with
[14:04] [Music]
[14:05] light then he become Paul the first
[14:14] messenger
[14:15] after
[14:19] cont all
[14:21] right now it's for men to make a
[14:25] contact not only not only to hear
[14:30] but make a
[14:34] contacte amen now now now it says here
[14:40] now we are looking at how God operates
[14:42] from their
[14:44] heart after he
[14:48] come
[14:52] amen we were looking at
[14:56] this even yesterday
[15:00] that brother
[15:02] [Music]
[15:05] says
[15:09] theed they wanted to see
[15:13] Jesus now he says they couldn't see he
[15:18] says actually they wanted to see
[15:21] God but they couldn't see
[15:24] God because he was in a human body
[15:31] now he says you can't see God in that
[15:37] way amen then he
[15:41] says what confused
[15:45] them and the
[15:47] Jew was that God was in
[15:54] a he says now when they come to see God
[16:01] see
[16:04] amen so they come to
[16:06] Jesus expecting to see
[16:10] God they they see
[16:14] aen and they
[16:16] say is this not this Joseph
[16:24] son is is is this not his brothers John
[16:31] then they say to
[16:33] him you being a
[16:37] man you make yourself
[16:40] God to them he was a
[16:46] man they could see
[16:50] inside so if you can't see
[16:53] inside you can only see a
[16:57] man
[16:59] say something
[17:03] here in the book The Same
[17:08] Book he
[17:10] says at page
[17:14] 6046 Christ is the of God
[17:18] revealed John the
[17:20] Baptist that great
[17:22] prophet come for and
[17:24] said there is one standing among you
[17:30] right
[17:32] now
[17:36] anary
[17:38] somewhere amen because he says look
[17:44] John never known
[17:51] Jesus being for the Holy Ghost pointing
[17:56] him out
[18:04] okay now let's look at
[18:07] this here is Jesus standing
[18:12] there and many people there now John is
[18:16] looking
[18:17] around because he must introduce the
[18:22] Messiah now Jesus looks like any
[18:25] [Music]
[18:27] other
[18:30] so can't introduce somebody that he he
[18:33] doesn't
[18:36] know now
[18:38] he he's looking
[18:41] around says he was looking with the eyes
[18:44] of an
[18:46] eagle so an eag can
[18:51] see he was looking
[18:54] around some people came some look like
[18:57] they could be be the
[19:01] Messiah but John couldn't recognize
[19:06] him and John says I didn't know
[19:14] him joh
[19:17] one says I did not know
[19:21] him because he couldn't know him as
[19:25] maning
[19:27] there
[19:30] until there was a
[19:33] supernatural and when the spirit come
[19:36] like
[19:38] Ave
[19:40] Jesus joh said now that is the L of
[19:47] god
[19:55] hee brother tells me that
[19:59] Abraham Abraham standing by the um door
[20:05] of the
[20:07] tent then he was looking
[20:10] away because he says what do you see
[20:13] when you
[20:15] look so he was looking
[20:20] away then he saw three Bs of
[20:26] Life saw that
[20:29] Abraham saw three balls of
[20:31] Life Abraham saw three balls of
[20:41] life then they were coming
[20:44] down and he
[20:46] says and
[20:48] Abraham saw
[20:50] him when he step into
[20:54] [Music]
[20:57] flesh
[21:00] amen John saw
[21:03] him when he stepped Upon
[21:20] Jesus that man was an ordinary
[21:24] man recognize him as
[21:29] [Music]
[21:40] came then Abraham said to
[21:43] Sarah
[21:45] sah prepare
[21:48] some
[21:52] food amen because El is now a man
[22:01] [Music]
[22:03] can eat
[22:04] [Music]
[22:08] now but before El could
[22:13] eat
[22:16] was that light could not
[22:20] eat that light could not
[22:24] e in the
[22:26] flesh
[22:29] and they brought food to
[22:33] El and
[22:38] said
[22:41] so now that is now you cannot recognize
[22:45] him unless you see first the
[22:53] supernal why he came to the
[22:56] bride
[22:58] [Music]
[23:04] [Music]
[23:15] super then you will see him in the body
[23:18] in
[23:22] the the coming of the Lord is this the
[23:26] coming of the Lord
[23:29] brother says he will never step
[23:37] his we meet him in the
[23:42] a will not
[23:46] [Music]
[23:51] come now he
[23:53] say the seventh
[23:56] seal brought
[24:03] him and it's a problem for the
[24:06] denominations and the
[24:10] people it was a problem for the
[24:15] Jews 3
[24:17] said the god you
[24:23] seek and they were waiting at Solomon's
[24:26] Temple there
[24:28] and he came
[24:32] [Music]
[24:34] the and they crucified that
[24:41] Temple to get of God they didn't believe
[24:46] the coming of
[24:49] the they believed it in
[24:55] writing didn't see it
[25:03] that's why the three
[25:06] Maj they came following
[25:11] a you could see it down
[25:17] [Music]
[25:26] here
[25:29] they come in
[25:32] Jerusalem and in
[25:35] Jerusalem they found the
[25:42] readers they they they just kept on
[25:48] reading amen and now
[25:54] the they came with another type of
[26:04] ministry so in the
[26:07] synagogue they had their
[26:09] scroll so they open the
[26:18] [Music]
[26:24] scroll and they look at
[26:26] the and
[26:29] say where
[26:36] is
[26:39] [Music]
[26:45] amen Pharisees
[26:48] thean the priest the were still in that
[26:56] script dispensation
[27:00] just without
[27:12] aill
[27:14] amen that's
[27:17] why said I have heard but now I you
[27:21] can't just keep keep on
[27:26] hearing
[27:32] it must bring you to a
[27:38] manifestation
[27:44] now because hearing alone is not a
[27:52] complete
[27:54] amen so I sent the people
[27:58] one
[27:59] day I was traving with young
[28:03] man now we were passing somewhere there
[28:06] was a
[28:10] construction now he says to
[28:14] me a hospital is coming
[28:17] there they building a
[28:19] hospital so I
[28:22] hear and I just waited for because I
[28:26] knew I knew this
[28:29] between I know that I must go the whole
[28:32] hearing and sing
[28:36] [Music]
[28:44] Hallelujah you hear you
[28:52] see okay so when the thing was completed
[28:55] the
[28:56] building
[28:59] in Ace
[29:03] [Music]
[29:05] station not
[29:08] Hospital what
[29:11] [Music]
[29:12] IP but now what I see
[29:15] is police
[29:19] station so
[29:21] hearing is part of the whole thing but
[29:24] it's
[29:26] not
[29:27] [Music]
[29:34] haveen before you can say this is
[29:38] this you must
[29:40] hear and see then you
[29:45] [Music]
[29:47] know let's read this before we
[29:53] can stood an ordinary
[29:56] man
[29:58] and he could not
[30:02] recognize all
[30:03] right now let's look at
[30:07] this as we are still going to
[30:10] continue now the prophet
[30:14] says because the message was coming to
[30:17] the
[30:20] bride amen amen the destination of the
[30:26] word because the word is
[30:29] seed the destination of the
[30:33] [Music]
[30:39] seed the male is a
[30:48] [Music]
[30:51] se but he cannot multiply until he finds
[30:56] a female
[31:01] [Music]
[31:05] and
[31:08] said it's
[31:10] good because if if there's no
[31:15] female he will just remain
[31:18] alone no
[31:21] multiplication already was
[31:23] out
[31:26] mtip
[31:29] so the
[31:32] [Music]
[31:34] SE
[31:37] alone he couldn't
[31:40] MP all
[31:42] right he had to find a
[31:48] female now as we have seen
[31:56] yesterday am
[31:59] coming to pick up the the bride for
[32:05] [Music]
[32:11] Christ wasck

[33:16] because was the destination
[33:22] of amen and the ministry of elah
[33:28] SE
[33:30] [Music]
