[8:27] same male and female
[8:32] 26 my brother
[8:40] Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 26.
[8:46] and God said let us make men in our
[8:49] image after our likeness and let them
[8:53] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[8:56] and over the fall of the egg and over
[8:59] the kettle and over all the Earth and
[9:01] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[9:04] upon the Earth 27 so God created men in
[9:08] his own image in the image of God
[9:10] created he him male and female created

[10:29] uh
[10:31] uh we created
[10:33] after God
[10:35] amen amen
[10:38] so God had a purpose to have somebody
[10:44] who be like him
[10:47] hallelujah amen
[10:50] so
[10:53] if you can come to
[10:57] um
[10:58] Genesis let me just go back a little bit
[11:01] uh you forgive me let me just go back
[11:04] let's go back to uh Genesis because
[11:17] uh we'll read that it might not make
[11:20] sense now but it will make sense as a
[11:22] way
[11:24] amen
[11:27] so yes Revelation yes that one my
[11:30] brother
[11:30] yes and I saw in the right hand of him
[11:34] that said on the throne a book written
[11:37] with pin and on the back side sealed
[11:40] with seven sealed Hallelujah so uh Danny
[11:54] and
[11:56] now outside of it
[12:00] Hallelujah
[12:01] don't imagine don't imagine as a man
[12:05] imagine as a spirit
[12:08] the book was was written on the outside
[12:14] hallelujah hallelujah so a man was
[12:18] formed in the form in the image of God
[12:22] hallelujah so if you come to Genesis 1
[12:25] you find that man is created
[12:31] who looks like God who walked like God
[12:36] but if you come to Genesis chapter 2
[12:40] that's where you find that uh the Bible
[12:42] says
[12:44] nothing grew up because man was not yet
[12:49] [Music]
[12:57] you think that Genesis 1.
[13:01] yeah and Genesis 2. there's so much
[13:04] there's so much repetition
[13:06] there's no limitation
[13:11] the word went out
[13:14] let's form let's create a man so a man
[13:19] who was created
[13:21] Mojo
[13:37] [Music]
[14:00] the first to come out
[14:07] came out of the Mask
[14:16] so for you
[14:20] God
[14:22] gave adam
[14:23] the godhood
[14:28] hallelujah hallelujah amen
[14:33] until some liar came let me let me show
[14:36] you you know when people come with a
[14:38] funny doctrines
[14:40] they're always very funny
[14:43] let me tell you here
[14:46] uh let's go to Genesis 3.
[14:49] uh you find that uh this uh
[14:53] there's a funny preacher who has come in

[15:10] just a three verse one now the serpent
[15:13] was more subtle
[15:15] that than any beast of the field which
[15:18] the Lord God hath made and he said unto
[15:21] the woman yes ye have God
[15:25] have God said he shall not eat of every
[15:28] tree of the garden and the woman said
[15:31] unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit
[15:34] of the Trees of the garden but of the
[15:37] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[15:39] of the garden God has said he shall not
[15:42] eat of it neither shall he touch it lest
[15:45] he died and the serpent said unto the
[15:48] woman he shall not surely die God says
[15:51] you shall die
[15:53] the serpent says
[15:58] um
[15:58] for God does know that in the day he eat
[16:02] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[16:05] and he shall be as Gods knowing good and
[16:08] evil just imagine that it was here God
[16:10] created him in his image
[16:13] and he's coming to sell them but if you
[16:16] do this you'll be like
[16:20] God created them as Gods there was no
[16:24] way somebody should tell them that they
[16:25] will be gods

[38:22] master Abraham behold I stand Here by
[38:26] The Well of water and the daughters of
[38:28] the men of the City come out to draw
[38:31] water and let it come to pass that the
[38:34] damsel to whom I shall say let down thy
[38:38] picture I pray this that I may drink and
[38:42] she shall say drink and I will give thy
[38:46] camel drink also let the same be she
[38:49] that thou has appointed for thy servant
[38:52] Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou
[38:56] has showed kindness unto my master
[38:58] Hallelujah now this is a book
[39:05] wishes has been written
[39:07] one part was given to Rebecca Rebecca
[39:12] give me a drink
[39:13] the other part left out
[39:20] which has happened to the Bible
[39:22] [Music]
[39:23] one part has been given to us the other
[39:27] part is outside
[39:28] because the one who tell you what is
[39:32] outside
[39:33] [Music]
[39:35] we should know that is the person who
[39:36] has been sent to us
[39:38] [Music]
[39:43] let's go to unveiling of God
[39:47] 64.
[39:49] 0 6 14.
[39:54] paragraph 22.
[39:56] amen
[39:58] they
[40:00] one part of the word was Kept Secret
[40:04] one part was given so that the one who
[40:08] brings this part which is uh a secret
[40:11] [Music]
[40:14] that's the one who belongs to the prince
[40:17] [Music]
[40:19] everybody also never know what it has
[40:21] been is what is outside
[40:30] let's lead together there so when uh
[40:34] when Rebecca was coming
[40:36] as my pastor always say
[40:39] he says that uh you know when uh women
[40:43] are are
[40:45] working at home they are not dressed at
[40:47] their best
[40:51] amen amen
[40:53] you know if she's going to draw water
[40:57] she should dress up on those clothes
[41:00] which are for work
[41:02] so if somebody is looking for a wife
[41:05] she goes to the workplace
[41:10] remember
[41:12] [Music]
[41:13] that was very good way of looking
[41:15] forward
[41:16] [Music]
[41:19] now my subject this morning I trust God
[41:23] will reveal this
[41:27] each time if you take the tips
[41:32] and I open trust that you have
[41:38] I hope
[41:41] that you have a spiritual understanding
[41:46] of what God is trying to get over to the
[41:51] church
[41:52] [Music]
[41:55] without saying it right out
[42:00] [Applause]
[42:03] God is trying to say something to his
[42:05] church
[42:07] but when he says it outright
[42:10] yeah
[42:14] so he says
