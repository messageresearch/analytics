[0:26] [Music]
[0:34] now if you are not predestinated
[0:36] you start to or tomorrow
[0:47] but you can't do that to a son of God
[0:51] because I will tell you straight that
[0:54] because yeah
[1:03] used to call them
[1:05] and
[1:21] then
[1:22] it is
[1:50] Park light
[1:53] they don't go further
[1:55] they end up with pretty teeth
[1:59] [Music]
[2:07] [Applause]
[2:11] you see you must take the whole thing
[2:14] from the prophet not a part of it
[3:08] write it
[3:11] what you need to get attracted to pull
[3:14] him to the next verse
[3:22] now comes the Son of God because he is
[3:26] that word
[3:27] he will read the whole chapter
[3:31] he is
[3:57] since I saw them they packed today
[4:07] but he is in his people
[4:13] and we can see his glory
[4:18] see the glory of the servants
[4:24] to his people
[4:27] because the enemy was not supposed to
[4:30] hear or see anything
[4:36] so that Satan could not pick down
[4:39] anything foreign
[4:43] ah
[4:46] let's look give me one second
[4:50] let me go back again Adam was here on
[4:54] Earth
[4:56] brother Brendan says he was the other
[4:58] part of the contract
[5:00] when he was here
[5:02] God moved things in heaven
[5:06] he brought them to Adam having said
[5:09] nothing
[5:22] the Earthly
[5:26] [Music]
[5:36] so the god of the earth
[5:38] contract with the god of the universe
[5:54] I mean
[5:58] so when it comes down
[6:00] now you well when you want to know the
[6:03] secrets
[6:05] hey you have to wait
[6:08] by the sight of Adam
[6:10] doing that every secret that is in in
[6:13] heaven
[6:15] this man will reveal it
[6:19] silence
[6:40] you don't have a revelation that is
[6:43] flying in the air foreign
[6:54] foreign
[6:59] [Music]
[7:01] oh man
[7:04] can I spend 15 minutes amen listen so
[7:08] potentially potential is in here
[7:13] and what it is lucky the word promised
[7:16] before the foundation of the world
[7:20] and around there this only reflects
[7:24] the negative yeah all winterfella
[7:28] negative this body
[7:31] that will reflect the positive well the
[7:34] whole ones are positive and the same
[7:36] thing you're not true or the translation
[7:39] of the Bride will be the same thing
[7:44] listen now tillage the word this is how
[7:48] it comes the word that's in you know
[7:55] the materialize around that word
[7:58] [Applause]
[8:02] in heaven
[8:07] and the same thing did by Sarah
[8:15] now here we are talking about an inside
[8:17] job materialize
[8:26] [Music]
[8:35] I mean
[8:36] a man and this body cannot do it
[8:40] so it will have to be changed
[8:44] [Applause]
[8:48] let me read the Bible and the Bible will
[8:51] tell us the true story
[8:54] while we are here turn also to your book
[8:58] Hebrews
[9:01] Hebrews chapter 11
[9:04] chapter 11 verse 11. amen
[9:16] chapter 11 verse 11 by Hebrew chapter 11
[9:19] verse 11 he who has it and reading
[9:22] English
[9:23] through Sarah also
[9:26] sorry true Faith also Sarah herself
[9:31] received strength to conceive seed and
[9:35] was delivered of a child when she was
[9:38] past age because she judged him faithful
[9:43] who had promised amen okay amen
[9:48] although I read this yesterday
[9:52] we'll say this again
[9:55] how it was channeled
[10:00] because if you read verse and
[10:07] what Hebrew
[10:09] what does verses
[10:12] 8 verse 8.
[10:15] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[10:19] go out into a place which he should
[10:23] after receive for an inheritance
[10:27] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[10:30] whether he went okay amen
[10:34] now we headed yesterday Pastor a bit of
[10:37] it
[10:38] says by faith Abraham Eric Eric
[10:44] verse 11 says
[10:47] [Music]
[10:49] now this time is Not By Faith
[10:52] because the faith is that of Abraham
[10:55] and the wife
[10:58] it says yes this is not a woman
[11:03] he called Abraham my Lord
[11:07] through faith of Abraham
[11:10] showing that Elijah operated through the
[11:14] faith of Abraham
[11:16] [Applause]
[11:19] but with Abraham
[11:21] by faith
[11:30] I mean
[11:33] with us the bride right is through the
[11:37] face of the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:42] amen the Bible says we operate through
[11:45] his face
[11:53] okay amen
[11:56] I will pass that because
[12:02] now God is going to bring seed
[12:07] in Isaac
[12:11] shall the seed be called
[12:14] all right now we're trying to put it
[12:17] together
[12:24] Joseph was not mentioned
[12:32] Joseph to excuse him foreign
[13:11] and became blood
[13:16] yeah somebody will believe it
[13:19] when that word fell into Layla
[13:23] by Gabriel yeah
[13:26] when it was given to a vision yes
[13:33] and said be and be it unto me
[13:38] according oh yeah
[13:43] what it means
[13:46] she's she firstly she thought I how can
[13:50] I have a baby
[13:58] amen but when the inside the Revelation
[14:02] started to build up
[14:06] then she corrected herself
[14:11] be it unto me
[14:19] amen
[14:20] amen not according to my understanding
[14:24] not according to my knowledge
[14:27] because I will depends on the way that
[14:32] you have spoken
[14:36] if the seven seal is open and he said
[14:39] nothing
[14:51] when he said that when she said
[15:00] it has been planted
[15:05] amen and Gabriel turned well around
[15:13] the will of God has been done
[15:17] the seed has been planted
[15:21] the sun will come forth
[15:25] now
[15:32] and Sarah started to feel things
[15:38] amen amen he used to go to collect water
[15:41] with some other women
[15:44] but you still wondering
[15:47] how come the Lord
[15:50] come to me
[15:52] I mean so it was building up a body for
[15:56] God
[16:00] and when that child was born
[16:04] he distanced himself from any other it
[16:08] would be parents
[16:13] foreign
[16:31] [Applause]
[16:41] and verse 11 now Abraham no I I quoted
[16:46] that one Hebrews
[16:54] it cease to be no
[16:56] verse 11.
[17:01] true Faith also Sarah herself received
[17:04] strength to conceive seed and was
[17:08] delivered of a child when she was past
[17:11] age amen amen
[17:15] when she was when she was
[17:21] when it was impossible for a woman
[17:29] foreign
[17:34] as we have passed
[17:37] amen
[17:41] amen
[17:43] when she passed age
[17:46] the operation was now God
[17:51] fulfilling his way
[17:58] I'm in
[18:00] so that giving Sarah or lesser could not
[18:04] boasts
[18:08] now as you go to chapter 18 of Genesis
[18:13] [Music]
[18:15] now Abraham and Sarah were old and
[18:18] well-stricken in age
[18:21] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[18:25] men of women
[18:30] amen amen are you with us
[18:35] it seized
[18:38] to be with sir
[18:42] she was beyond that okay

[18:55] manner of women
[19:01] she was sort of just waiting for
[19:04] the whisker while images
[19:08] so that she can go to rest what are you
[19:11] good but at that time there was a
[19:14] visitation

[19:57] he comes in yeah
[20:03] yeah
[20:04] when Lazarus was dead
[20:07] he came in he laughed that he came after
[20:11] he was dead
[20:13] [Applause]
[20:15] to display his powers
[20:20] when Lazarus is alive
[20:23] and also to display his power look like
[20:30] he said to Martha I am the resurrection
[20:35] so he wanted to a situation
[20:46] is the resurrection
[20:51] I mean now he could not share
[20:54] the resurrection with death
[21:01] that's why he came with Lazarus

[21:13] of Lazarus which is the remains part of
[21:18] the family

[26:20] Abraham Abraham stood yet
[26:27] his ministry comes up to that yeah
[26:30] then the Bible says the next morning he
[26:35] came back to the same place

[26:43] Lord
[26:45] I'll be able to see

[27:40] I'm so glad I'm one of them
[27:44] amen somewhere with the Lord
[27:47] yeah we will look down
[27:50] these things
[27:53] for he said I shall not hide from
[27:56] Abraham
[27:59] but what I want to you to look at
[28:02] secretary verse chapter 21 Genesis
[28:05] chapter 21 release hold on for a while
[28:08] and the Lord visited Sarah as he has
[28:11] said
[28:14] I mean I mean now here he doesn't speak
[28:16] of Abraham
[28:18] it's just he said
[28:22] I shall return I will return
[28:27] the ministry went to Sarah now
[28:30] concentration
[28:36] amen did you ever went to attend a
[28:40] wedding alone
[28:43] I mean the concentration is always on
[28:46] the bride yeah
[28:49] I mean
[28:51] the man you can put the best suit or
[28:54] watch against
[28:58] the people don't care about them
[29:00] they say oh look at that dress
[29:06] the concentration is on the female
[29:10] now here we see
[29:12] God himself
[29:14] concentrating on the woman
[29:18] amen because
[29:25] a man cannot conceive
[29:28] so I mean it should come from the Menace
[29:34] their whole concentrations
[29:52] are you listening friends
[29:54] and if she's become so important
[30:02] even if she comes in today
[30:11] because they can see that she's very
[30:13] important
[30:14] it's two people in one okay
[30:18] so they always say it's sorry for Mama
[30:21] their concentration is now on the bride
[30:25] that's why even today the concentration
[30:34] is the manifestation
[30:37] of the seed where they preached by the
[30:40] prophet
[30:46] Amish
[30:49] brother Brendan says
[30:53] Jesus just believed in what the way they
[30:57] say amen he is
[31:01] you too I lose amen
[31:08] amen
[31:10] amen and when they come to join like I
[31:13] would just say who are you he said I am
[31:17] the voice
[31:22] [Music]
[31:27] he manifested Isaiah 44 foreign
[31:35] [Applause]
[31:58] we cannot preach Who We Are
[32:05] and Jesus preached who he is
[32:42] amen amen I'm trying to drive you to a
[32:46] place
[32:48] you should be changed amen
[32:54] and yes yours your body is old outside
[32:57] [Applause]
[33:04] cannot see the seventh seals
[33:07] which should be a changed
[33:15] amen amen actually to say he's a new
[33:19] person
[33:20] is not to say he started there
[33:24] is because he was newly introduced
[33:29] he's been there before
[33:32] but as he was now introduced in this
[33:36] time he is Sarah
[33:52] in his
[33:54] mission that means if you look at him
[34:04] at the same time of which God had spoken
[34:10] amen amen and even
[34:14] there's something again
[34:19] when Abraham died
[34:22] how old was he
[34:26] I'm trying to read it here
[34:30] we'll find it find it for me
[34:33] when Abraham died
[34:35] how old was he
[34:39] you don't know
[34:42] because you didn't attend the funeral
[34:47] chapter 25
[34:49] verse seven follow it chapter 25 verse 7
[34:54] and these are the days of the years of
[34:57] Abraham's life
[35:00] which he lived in in 103 score and 15
[35:06] years
[35:10] then Abraham died in a good old age
[35:18] an old man
[35:22] full of years
[35:26] and yet after God has changed him
[35:33] I mean
[35:35] so there was something another person in
[35:37] abrahamas

[35:45] but yet when they look at him he was
[35:49] still old
