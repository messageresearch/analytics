========================================
[Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We thank God for another touch. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you as we meet again this morning around the throne of God [Music] from him again. [Music] Isn't he wonderful? Amen. Hallelujah. Okay. And also happy to have our pastors pastors are shepherds and you are all sheep. So pastor is a shepherd. The Bible says &gt;&gt; they will feed you with knowledge and &gt;&gt; so uh &gt;&gt; God bless you pastor Bella and my pastors here. It's wonderful to be together again now uh just to redeem time. And let's turn to our Bibles again this morning and this evening. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh Luke 4 16. Let us pray. [Music] You remain the same tonight in this place for one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To hear from you again, [Music] [Music] all our efforts in Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 4 16-21. &gt;&gt; Luke 4:16-21. &gt;&gt; Luke 4 verse 16- 21. [Music] for [Music] tomorrow for Amen. [Music] Amen. Amen. Verse 21. And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set a liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord." And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your in your ears." You may be seated blessire [Music] to hear from his mouth. The one who said, "Let there be." He's the one who said, "Let there be." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was so. So tonight, [Music] he can say a word. His word is creative. Amen. Amen. So now for subject the subject we want just to bring this thought the role. [Music] Amen. You know in the olden days they used to have a scroll. Amen. So this is what he stood to read that day. Now that's why they call it the call. Amen. Amen. So how God spread the universe and everybody out there just how he did with human beings through the ages. And in each age there's a prophecy. Amen. &gt;&gt; On the day of Pentecost, how Peter stood up and said, "This people are not drunk with wine. It's a prophecy now being fulfilled prophesied. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So it was a fulfillment of a prophecy. So that's how God deals with human beings. When the Messiah was born, it was a fulfillment of prophecy. When we were born, it was the fulfillment of our meeting here tonight. as we should look at ourselves as a prophetic class and since Monday we've been going through uh the beginning the Lord Jesus Christ he compels us to go back to the beginning. Amen. That's why we read the scripture. He said to the disciples, it was not so. So the picture is back there. In the beginning was the way and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Now let's look at the the role call &gt;&gt; how God said let us men in our image &gt;&gt; he didn't say plural he said &gt;&gt; amen he said Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us plural. Amen. &gt;&gt; And people are asking themselves, &gt;&gt; who are these people? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But down the line, we see the outlets of God. people spoke to a meeting. &gt;&gt; And now this letter was in another dimension. And then after that &gt;&gt; we see him &gt;&gt; coming down &gt;&gt; and to make men out of the dust. &gt;&gt; But remember man is a spirit and God made a tabernacle for each and every life. and he had put in that tabernacle. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Bible says after he molded that statue then he breathe into it breath of life. Amen. statue started to vibrate and he became a living soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God brought one man. This is a special planet the earth. As God is a spirit. But God wanted to fellowship. So he had attributes in himself. So he couldn't fellowship with the attributes. So he was supposed to bring them into indiv. So I will take that scripture again and now uh because after I said let us uh you look for the people he was talking with you these things were proposed [Music] So let us this was in himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just as all things were the Bible says &gt;&gt; all things were let me put it this way. All things &gt;&gt; consist. [Music] So uh here while while reading here let me read Ephesians chapter one Ephesians chapter one &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter one &gt;&gt; chapter one &gt;&gt; says verse 9 verse 9 &gt;&gt; he made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure &gt;&gt; which he has proposed post where &gt;&gt; in himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times he might gather together in one all things in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Both which are in heaven and which are upon earth even in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So these things were proposed in him. Now I read again first John epis first epistle of John chapter one &gt;&gt; verse one that which was from the beginning [Music] that's something that started in year 2007 year 2007 from the beginning. Now God is eternal. Hallelujah. He has no starting point. &gt;&gt; We sing he he was there all the time. &gt;&gt; He is eternal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then he indicated that &gt;&gt; when the Bible says he had no mother, no father, beginning of days end. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the priest of your [Music] hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When this shall dissolve, we have another hands. Amen. &gt;&gt; The high priest of those people are &gt;&gt; these people. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I'll show you that &gt;&gt; you are not a new person. [Music] We read Ephesians 1 vers4 &gt;&gt; as he has chosen us. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Because he is the container of all life. All the prophets were in him. &gt;&gt; All the people were in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, and uh today we are his outlet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why now we can reflect back to the beginning as his offspring. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now it says &gt;&gt; that is epistle of John. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did he say? That which you have heard because tonight you hear because you have heard &gt;&gt; but you see because you have seen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh with our eyes &gt;&gt; which we have looked upon our hands have handled the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now after that the way he had spread the universe even scientists believe in that big blast. One big blast. And from that one big mess, &gt;&gt; that of energy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the sun &gt;&gt; contains energy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And science also believe that there was a a a great blast. That's how the universe started. That's how it was spread out from one source. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that each and every boy, heavenly boy should contain that contain it. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen from the sun. Now you see life, you see life, they must have light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh now let's go to the word to the scripture. &gt;&gt; And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. &gt;&gt; Now this is the same man the beginning. &gt;&gt; The Bible says &gt;&gt; he's the beginning. I won't read now, but say it is the beginning. In the beginning was the word verse 14. The word was made flesh and dwelt among. So the word was in the beginning was the word and now that in the beginning flesh. &gt;&gt; The very same person was &gt;&gt; God unfolded himself to a form a human form. Amen. Hallelujah. You know how Abraham he saw Elohim was the selfexisting one. Now he came to Abraham &gt;&gt; and the Bible says he ate bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Abraham called him my Lord. &gt;&gt; There were two other ministers with him. Abraham recognized this one. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says after they took their lunch, &gt;&gt; Abraham let them let them out &gt;&gt; and the two went down to the Bible says, "But God remained with Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he started to talk with Abraham about the promise &gt;&gt; promise and now he came &gt;&gt; and he went into the synagogue. you know, the Sabbath day &gt;&gt; the Jews would wait for him on the Sabbath day. Even today you go to Jerusalem, the Jews, every time some of them, every time they go to the table, they sit around the table, they will put one glass aside and say, "This one is for El because they are expecting Elijah to come. and expecting the messiah to come. That's why the Bible says the two witnesses they shall go down to dead. Yes. The Lord Jesus said to Peter, John and James, let us go up the mountain. on the seventh day of this of this saying we won't read it today but he went with them up when they reach the top [Music] &gt;&gt; so don't go to their grave [Music] Hallelujah. But your spirit returns to and your spirit waits there until that day when all the sleeping saints shall come forth and the spirit shall be released. Picked up the theophony. Amen. Now not an old boy shall be [Music] was a young man in the first he was a young man in the first covenant naked no shame theible says they were naked no shame that was in the first covenant They were covered &gt;&gt; by the word of God. But after she tasted from the tree fruit started. Okay. Now he came and stood up to read and there was delivered unto him the book of prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, because the book contained the names of the people, &gt;&gt; inheritance and so forth, &gt;&gt; the book amen. That's why the Bible says the books were open, the book of life. We'll come to that. Let's look at this. There and there was delivered unto him. Now we are talking about the beginning. We are talking about this man is the beginning. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there he stood among them who know him and and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. &gt;&gt; And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we are going to talk about the wrong where you are called &gt;&gt; and you hear your name being called and you find your place in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when he had opened the book He found the place &gt;&gt; as we opened the Bible and found the place that's why we are believers. Amen. We have found each and everyone has a place in the Amen. &gt;&gt; You open you find yourself. [Music] He was talking to me. &gt;&gt; As you know, God always specified like he said, "Behold, I will send unto you." &gt;&gt; Then it comes another one says, &gt;&gt; "I don't believe and so forth. &gt;&gt; I will send unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So somebody will believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. They could not be the recogniz you watch this this thing here. God bless you. Paul says something. &gt;&gt; Don't read because I'm still there. But I just want Colosians 1 verse 25 says &gt;&gt; I just read 21 &gt;&gt; 21 &gt;&gt; of which I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God. [Music] Amen. Amen. given unto me for you to fulfill the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To fulfill. Amen. &gt;&gt; What what what this fulfillment means to God. When God looks at you, [Music] he sees his own image. [Music] &gt;&gt; When his will is fulfilled, the image of God. Let us make men in our image. An image. Let me uh go back to this again. &gt;&gt; If you look in the mirror, &gt;&gt; you see yourself. Because if you can see a lion but if it's a lion it will smile because seeing itself now a mirror in the mirror you see yourself and if like the people you know if you and look through the uh keyhole. Maybe in the morning you find somebody looking in the mirror this way, walking that way because he wants to see him or herself. When God said, "Let us make men in our image." Now your image, you look in the mirror, you see yourself. If you see the image smiling, you are smiling. [Music] If you see an image dancing, so God wanted it to be like that. That's why he said you shall do. He said &gt;&gt; you can say to this mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Move and it will move &gt;&gt; and that will be God doing it through. [Music] It was God and his son Adam. Then the Bible tells me that God after creating things he brought them before Adam [Music] says whatever Adam named So that was his image. &gt;&gt; Now if you see yourself telling, if you see that man in the mirror walking under a drunken stuper, &gt;&gt; if you see him telling lies, you are telling lies. If you see him smoking, you can't no &gt;&gt; I understand there was somebody two ladies and they had stolen from a shop. &gt;&gt; You know how they do it women. Oh, the camera was there. They didn't know. So then they left the shop. Then the security followed them &gt;&gt; back into the shop. Arrested, you have stolen what? So they went to court &gt;&gt; and they denied &gt;&gt; once said on that particular day I was sick. You know how the people can tell. &gt;&gt; Amen. The other one says I was in that day. Then they said okay. Okay. One lady had this camera the film said all right let's see. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they run the film. The next day these two ladies were looking at it and the one said after playing it lawyer was puzzled again after they said that's your image. That's why now God after his plan was man in Eden. He started another plan because he couldn't stand it because man in his mirror &gt;&gt; in his image. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he started a a a plan of restoration to bring that man back again. so that the fellowship can start again. &gt;&gt; That's why this evening a sinner out there can see God, &gt;&gt; they see you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, you don't go out and preach to the people unless you reflect God. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why God said let us make him in our image and when the Lord Jesus was on earth he said so shine and he said you are the light of the world. Imagine [Music] how should the light conduct itself. &gt;&gt; Didn't the Lord said you are the light? &gt;&gt; The Bible says he is the light of the world and he said you are the light of the world. Now you can read between lines. &gt;&gt; Let us make many in our image. &gt;&gt; Then he comes again. &gt;&gt; I am the light of the world. &gt;&gt; You are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that means &gt;&gt; you are a reflector [Music] of the main light. So people through you can look and see God and they can see the good works of the father. But you are the window to that. Amen. Oh, let's go back or let's proceed. And he found the place where it was written. [Music] Are you with us? [Music] &gt;&gt; He found He found &gt;&gt; the place where it was written, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Bible says &gt;&gt; after this he closed the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that part to them was closed &gt;&gt; and to him it was fulfilled. &gt;&gt; So he opened and read about himself. The spirit of the Lord is upon me. Amen. Hallelujah. Then after that the Bible says &gt;&gt; and the eyes of all of them were in who were in the synagogue were fastened on him. Why is this man trying to tell us that he is the fulfillment of this? Amen. Then the he began to say unto them, "This day, this day is the scripture fulfilled in your he never said in your heart." [Music] Amen. And you know &gt;&gt; because to a Christian fulfillment is in the heart. &gt;&gt; But to them he said your ears. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can go just as far as hearing me. He said to them, "You can go that far." &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we find he the Bible says &gt;&gt; he found the place. If you read John again, &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going to say &gt;&gt; uh maybe by the time we wrap up, &gt;&gt; maybe each and every one of us show us this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I show you John had a record and every believer now has a place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, John chapter one, &gt;&gt; Johannapter one, &gt;&gt; I read this part. &gt;&gt; Verse 24. &gt;&gt; Now, Philip was of the city of Andrew and Peter. So unto him, take it onto him. We have found him. &gt;&gt; We have found him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Uh there's a time when you hear &gt;&gt; about him and there's a time when we should find him. Yes sir. So God is not a rumor. &gt;&gt; He is life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why people come short. They believe come short. Amen. We end up with miracles and wonders. But finding him because in the beginning in the beginning was the way [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
