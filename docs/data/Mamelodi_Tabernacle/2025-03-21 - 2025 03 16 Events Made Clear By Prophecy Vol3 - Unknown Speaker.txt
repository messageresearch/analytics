Let us pray once again. Gracious Lord, being the great physician, being the one Lord Almighty who said, "He that is overladen, let him come to me, I will relieve him of the weight that you'll be carrying." And father this morning we have requests of different kinds that comes from the believers Lord and even people outside. They didn't go to any soothsayer to request assistance but father they prefer to come unto thee knowing that Lord you are always in season and you always hear our prayers. So this morning, Father, we come unto thee, Lord, committing all these requests unto thee knowing, Lord Almighty, that there's not even a single one that won't be attended to because they came to the right place. Father, in the Old Testament, you used to stop people from going to strange God and say, "Is there no guide? Is there no god among you that you could go to strange gods? And father nowadays people knows that when they come to you they come to the right place. May you extend lord almighty your hand lord and protect them and bless them and give them according to your promise. You said you'll always be with us and even this morning you are with us.

While standing or before we read the scriptures I just want to tell the children of God again that we were in the previous week and since we visited We always baptize people. So he blessed as we told two souls last week that normally travel is a place called Amen. So while I was looking at the map of I've realized that there's two three district that's left. if we visit them and preach the word of God. We will be preaching the message the entirely soon. So and all other district we visited we baptized people. Yeah. There's a place called we want to go there. The other one is snake. No. The other one is Kasha and the other one is river. If we can visit those three district this ministry has gone far. I I remember when the pastor commissioned us to he said to us you are going to preach to the people that God has prepared already. You know if God has prepared something, you don't strike it. You just say a word and the people respond because it's God who called them. So thanks for your prayers. It is because you pray for all these outreaches. We see God doing wonders. keep on praying for the missions. Let's pray for our Easter services as well here at home and other areas. Amen. Amen. May God richly bless you and then let's open our Bible in the book of Daniel chapter 2. Today we are going to wrap up. I'm bringing the part three of the message we preached previously were events made clear by prophecy. Today is the last part of that message. Amen. Amen. Let's bow our head and pray. Gracious and eternal father, we want to thank you Lord God this morning for the wonderful day you have given unto us. Amen. Oh father God the prophet has taught us that between us and the sinners it's such a thin line. No wonder this morning we appreciate every bit of our life. It is because of not because of what we know. It is because of your grace. We will forever appreciate you Lord God. Bless each and every individual this morning when we started the service. We call upon your name even before the reading of the scripture. We will call upon your name for you are the author of this great book. We know heavenly father there are many book that were written in the universities and so forth. The syllabus change whenever they want to change it but you are wait the bible remain the bible. It will never be changed for our name are written in the lamb's book of life. It's an eternal book heavenly father that was inspired by you. It's in every moment when we read it, we see life in it. Father God, we are going to read the portion of the scripture this morning. May you inspire us Lord God. May you make us a good listeners. Lord God, we know heavenly father in life we have some challenges. I pray for our children at school. The demon has descended there because he know if he can catch them, there's no leaders of tomorrow. There's no children of God of tomorrow. So we pray for them that they should steadfastly stayed in this word for this word is the absolute of our life. Pray for the families. Heavenly Father, h God is a God of a family. No wonder heavenly father as we go unto the eternal city is the bride and the groom. It's a family. So we love you so much as we are worshiping as family. We believe heavenly father is just a foretaste of what you have prepared for us. We love you so much. I pray for our pastor heavenly father. I know he's streaming. He's listening to the word. He's the one heavenly father inspiring us from this pulpit because it's belonging to him. May you help him heavenly father and give him courage each day for we love him so much. Lord God, we appreciate you and we give you honor in everything in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's read our regular scripture. From the book of Daniel 2. Yes. Amen. Amen. Well, let's let's read 34 to 35 for now. Amen. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smoked the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and break them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the the chaff of the summer threshing floors. And the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them. And the stone that the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. As I said is the part three of the previous message we spoke about. But the subtitle this morning getting into the new city Jerusalem and then that is the end of everything. Amen. Amen. When we speak about the eternal city, we speak about the new Jerusalem. When we speak about where we will spend our eternity is the new Jerusalem is the end of our journey and everything going eternal. Amen. Amen. So I was reading or looking at the news. Those that normally check the news, you'll start to realize that everything came to an end. There's nothing new that will come. Yes, everything came to an end. I just want to give you an example of what is happening. I was looking at the conversation between the president of USA president of Ukraine and of Russia as they were talking because of the war that is raging. Amen. Amen. What what causes war is is a disagreement of some sort. when we disagree and not reach an agreement, we we start fighting. There's something I picked up when the president of America was talking to the president of Ukraine. He said, "I I don't like your behavior because the game you are playing, you lead us to the third world. I grabbed it. I interrogated the things wanting to know what he mean. What will be the next thing? Amen. Amen. So the third world war does not start when the superpower country fight but it start when the small country started to disagree and the bigger one them up what is happening in Ukraine. Let me give you the background. Ukraine in the olden days was part of Russia. People in the Ukraine are Russians. You understand? More especially those one on the border of Ukraine Russians. Before I get there, let Before I get there, let me give you this example. I was following this war of this place called GMA in DRC. What was happening is the eastern part of DRC next to when I trace the thing those people in DRC are. So when they fight Paul will stand for them and the South African soldiers were killed there because they were peacemakers. When you look peacemakers for that, you will realize how cruel is this world. They were not peacemakers, to protect the people, but they were peacemakers to protect the mind for the elite for the elite. Amen. Amen. That's what is happening. I was reading in Ukraine, his son has got business in Ukraine. So you go there working for the government not not knowing in fact you are protecting the properties for the elite. Take an example here at home. You go to the mine every day when we get to the mine we find soldiers we find police saying they don't want the strike. But go to the schools of the government, go to the clinic, go to the government building, no one is protecting them. So it's the interest of the people that are up there, those that read the news. You see how small is challenged South Africa now they say free state belongs to us and when you look at free state it's you understand then when South Africa tried to rise is said you don't do it I'm on the side of such small wars. Such disagreement lead to the third world because if you can't the one having the upper hand will stand for you. When Paul Kagami tried to speak Russia said you don't dare do that. Amen. Amen. So Donald Trump being the peacemaker said to you know Vladimir no Zilinski he said to him the only thing that you must do you must do what Putin is asking because if you don't do it we are going to the third world and put in that moment he's quiet the moment he start talking. He said to the world to the European, you small European countries, if you want to challenge me, you must really brace yourself. You know, he's standing in front of something like a pool pit. There's a there's a red button. He said to them, "If you jump, I press." And Donald Trump is very much aware of it that Russia is well armed. If that man said it can only take a drunk man, press a button and then the entire world is Vladimir Putin standing there. I'm not scared of America. I'm not scared of Europe. I'm not scared of UK start. I will show you. So the disagreement of Russia, USA, Ukraine, Europe, we don't even count Africa. The disagreement will lead to the third world war. only thing that left even them they are aware and they are talking about it. So when you look nothing is left I heard him Donald Trump saying to the prime minister of UK saying can you challenge Russia alone? Amen. He couldn't know what to say because he knows exactly he cannot challenge. So the wars that come lead us to the third world war is the last war that will usher us into eternity. You you you will see how brother Brenam put it here because I said some previously but today we are getting into the music. Amen. Amen. I made a small presentation for your understanding if you can put it for us. Amen. Amen. Mhm. This is what Nebuchadnezzar dreamed but he forgot about it from his time until eternity. He saw what happened. That is why he was so troubled of what is happening because I see this kind of an image and I don't understand it. So he saw this. Daniel came and explained to him, "You Nebuchadnezzar, you are the gold." Amen. You are on top of everything. You have power the entire world. But there will come a kingdom after. Amen. And another kingdom. And another kingdom and the last kingdom as written there. Amen. Amen. So now when you look at when you look at this this kingdom all of them Babylon until Rome they were into ashes but another kingdom came and stayed eternal. Amen. Amen. Mean in this kingdom they were temporal in this world. When we are here this morning we are longing to be in that eternal kingdom because the temporal kingdom taking us nowhere. So when you look at the go to the next slide, the Bible says there was a stone being cut and not by the hand of a man and it hit right at the bottom of the image. When it hit the bottom of the image, there at the bottom of the image is Russia. Russia and America. America is clay and isle is Rome hidden. Rome hidden behind America. America being the lamb being the peacemaker but Rome even that still being the beast. I want to tell you this. All the wars that America started saying they bring peace in Libya, in Iraq, in all other places. Is there still a peace today? They suffered before. Amen. Amen. When you read the history of Libya, they say there was no orphan orphan. There was no poor people. The people lived good life. They had hospital. They had schools. They had everything. But since Russia, I mean since America say they are bringing peace into the country. Now they regret what they did to their leader. Amen. Amen. So when you look at America, it's Rome hidden behind. Amen. Amen. So it comes as a lamb. It comes as a unifier. When the president of America speak to the one of Russia, he knows what he's capable of. He can play his cards very well. The only thing that can win is when he compromised Ukraine to fall in the you know in the knee of Russia. Amen. Amen. Then I went deeper studying this. I even saw some cl some videos. When the United Kingdom soldiers, troops, United Kingdom go to Ukraine to help. They never went back home. All dead. The USA eight team went there. The German went there. Amen. You know, Russia stood in a strategic area whereby they see you, you don't see them. The moment you see them, you are dead. Those people, they are 10 times ahead of the entire world. When Donald Trump look at them, he realized that yeah, here we met the real people. They are not easy. That's why he said to this one, listen to Putin, you shall survive. Otherwise, you go to third world war. And let me tell you, there's no other way. The third world war is the war that should come and lead us into eternity. You know why? The Bible says there's three ws. The three wars, the first world war, the second world war and the third world war. They must happen. The third one they talking about. It must happen. Amen. Amen. So at the moment they are just trying this and that is leading to the third world. But we thank God the rapture will take us is the first thing that the Christ will take. That was the first step to eternity. Amen. Amen. Now all this kingdom will be finished. That stone heat the clay and the iron. The clay is Russia. The iron is America. America. The the prophet says so as in war and cru. Amen. representing the eastern and the western countries. That is what will happen. So the Russian themselves if they can win in the third world war is the finishing of everything when you read the Bible it says the only thing that left was dust. That stone hid right at the bottom of the image fell and became dust. When it becomes dust in history, he saw that stone becoming a big mountain. Here you get that big mountain it becomes a big city and in that city there are people that have it there. Amen. Amen. Nebuchadnezzar saw that thing he was troubled until Daniel come and explain to him. So whatever is happening today is leading us to the third world. There's no turning back. Putin speak about it. Donald Trump speak about it. And Putin said I'm scared of know what you can do whatever you want. I know which button to press and deal with you. When he speak to Gagam in Randa, he retreated. He knows Ronda is small in a minute can be ashes. When I was looking at the missile of Russia hitting the planes, Amen. and those tankers. I was wondering if maybe there's an something, you know, an an element or something that is pulling it to them because when the plane is going this side, they shoot from behind will take a direction to the plane. how advanced they are. One missile going out is not missing the target straight to the target. Amen. Amen. That is the only thing that is left. So my message today is getting into the news. Amen. Why? All kingdoms has failed. All kingdoms will collapse. The arms that they made is the one that is going to kill them, that is going to clean the whole world. So when looking at that stone, the stone was Christ himself eating all the kingdom was a big mountain. The mountain becames the big city and the big city was eternal. We can read it on verse 33 to 453 to 45. his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou sawest still that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and break them to pieces. Then was the iron that lay the brass, the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the shaft of the summer threshing floors. And the wind carried them away that no place was found for them. And the stone that smowed the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. This is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. Thou, oh king, are a king of kings, for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom. Amen. Stop there. Amen. That's what Daniel explained to Nebad. But the part I want to take here is verse 45 where we start our message. It says, "For as much as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hand, and that is break in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold. And the great God had made known to the king what shall come here after." Amen. Amen. So that's where I want to start. The stone became the new city. The stone stayed eternal. Let's go to Revelation chapter 21. Amen. When you read Revelation chapter 21, you saw what the stone became turned into. Amen. Amen. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sin. And I, John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. The answer for Daniel chapter 2 is Revelation chapter 21. That stone became the new seed. the new Jerusalem, the holy city, the one that stayed eternal. And there should be people that will stay in that seat. Brother Brham says, "The one that stayed in the city is the bride and the groom. For the bride and the groom are one." Amen. Amen. And that thing will stay eternal. That means there are people that are eternal. Amen. Amen. The bride is the people that got saved from Ephesus church until theian church. That is the bride of Jesus Christ. Those are the one that will be inhabitants. in the city. Amen. Amen. So when they stayed in the city, the Bible says there will be people outside of the city that they stay there to bring thanksgiving to the groom and the bride. Inside is us. Hallelujah. I last time said there's a nation of God and there's a church of God. The nation of God is Israel. If you are against Israel, you against God and there's a church of God is the bride of the Lord Jesus. You be against the bride of Jesus Christ. You are against God. Irrespective of the condition. You curse Israel, you shall be cursed. You curse the bride, you shall be cursed. Those are the two things that God wanted. God could have chose the Chinese, but we can blame him to choose Israel. God could have chose the Methodist church, but he chose you. He chose you and gives you the life eternal. No one can blame what God is doing. God is working on the predestination. Before the foundation of the world, he forneew you. Brothers and sisters, if before the foundation of the world, hell belongs to you. You can pray harder. You can fast, you can come to church, you will never go to heaven. But if heaven belongs to you. Amen. Amen. before the foundation of the world. You may go through a lot. You may fall, but you will arise. You will be sick, but you will be healed because heaven belongs to you. God is waiting on them. I normally say to us, brothers and sisters, let's just walk. Let's just walk upon the path that God has prepared for them. A complete job was done. And the Bible says he died for us at the cross before the foundation of the world. Before the foundation of the world, he knew you will be born in sin, shaped in iniquity, have problem of the world, have tested and so forth. But the heavens belongs to you. [Music] That is why sometimes when we have worries about the things of the world, we sometimes miss who we are. If we can know who we are, uh we we we just war and say, "Lord God, you know the day I die, you know, the day I'm in the rapture, you know, why should I worry about the things that are temporal?" Nebuchadnezzar has seen the kingdom coming, powerful as they are. but they were temporal. And he saw the kingdom that will stay eternal and the people that will stay in the kingdom. I'm so happy this morning to stand in front of those people that are standing for eternal. We are the eternal being. We may look down at ourselves, but before God, we are more than a human being. We are supernatural. Let God open the eyes for us and see who we are. The people that are in the new city, that will be in the new city, they know themselves. Amen. Amen. Brother says, "Even if God can take me to hell, I will still say you are a good God. That is not just a saying. You know why is saying that? Because of one thing. He can't change anything. Can I repeat myself? He cannot change. A complete job was done just that at the right time unfold. God could have make you Adam, could have make you Enoch, but he knew you are not Enoch or Adam. But he make you who you are this morning for you to finish the race of a human being. We will be somewhere looking at Russia, looking at the man is talking about the party. We will be looking and say Lord God how merciful. Brothers and sisters we have done nothing go good before God. I want to be honest with you. We have done nothing but God do something good to us. That's why we are here this morning with courage to worship him because he revealed himself unto us. Amen. [Applause] Amen. Amen. I I testified to a certain brother when I was still young, not even married. Now the other brother asked this one whom I testified. He said, "How did you get the message?" He said, "No, now I talk too much. No one has testified to me. I just asked this man where you follow she then I said in Mori. Then we came together. That's how I got the message. Then I looked down and smiled. I said this kind of character. They don't go anywhere in life. I'm honest with you. Someone make you something you think you made yourself who you are. Let's repent. Amen. Amen. They're not going anywhere. Because for me to say, brother harvest has helped me. It's like I'm taking glory to him. You have a pride that is not taking you anywhere. If somebody has done good to you, you must thank him, you must thank God because God use a human being to save another human being. Brother said we are savior. We are saviors. We are saviors. We are redeemers. God made us to redeem the people. God made us to save the people because we are amate God. You You did not fall from the tree. God sent someone to tell you about the message. That's why you are here this morning. The Enoch of Ethia when he was reading the Bible, he couldn't understand. But God sent the man of God said to Philillip, "Go to him." He never prayed for Philillip. But God sent Philillip. I want to tell you brothers and sisters, you have done nothing good before God. God sent men of God to show you the way. We better appreciate that and appreciate God. We are not the inhabitants of this world. When Nebuchadnezzar was looking, the reason why he said to those you know he said all those charians you know the sorceress the magician and everything he said to them if you don't tell me what I dreamed about I kill all of you that thing is between life and death I must know if it take a life of human being for me to have the answer so be it but I will eliminate all of you. Amen. And they were very much honest. They said no man from underworld no man from the fifth dimension can tell you that because we are from underworld. We are from the fifth dimension. We do not have answer but we need a man that come from the seventh dimension. That is the man who can tell us the answer. No wonder Daniel stood up and said, "God has spoken to me. God has given me the answer. King, this is what you dream about. Blessed art thou for you have seen the beginning of the kingdom until the end of the earthly kingdom and you have seen eternity." Because when you see that stone becoming a big mountain, becoming a new city, becoming people staying in even outside, that was eternity. And he said to him, "Those that kingdom will stay forever. There were people walking in and out. There were people enjoying themselves. Who are those people? It's you. Nebuchadnezzar saw you. Daniel saw you and brother come and said to you I saw you there. When you live in this world, you just leave but you are living somewhere. The life that you live somewhere is influencing this one. Amen. Amen. Brother Abraham said to another woman, he looked at them and said, "Oh, I saw these people in her." But they were living, they were walking in an escalator. I want to tell you, even if he can preach hard, those people will never go to heaven. [Music] Brother said, "I saw you. You are sinless. You are spotless. You are without wrinkle. When I saw you that side, you are perfect. But check how struggling you are. You don't have a job. You don't have money. Sometimes you think negative things. Sometimes you want to commit suicide. Sometimes you think why do I live for? Sometimes you think God can just take you. But when look at you, he look at you being a perfect being up there. And this body when it comes to an end, you just go in there. Look at Lazarus, you know, licking his own soul. Look at licking his own soul. Look at Lazaro. As rich as he was, you know, life turns like this. The one that suffered, the one that suffered was comforted. The one that think he lives in a comfort life, he was in danger. He was in tal. Amen. Even if when he's on the other side, he had the gut of saying, "Send Lazaro to my brothers." When he was here, he said to jump will say, "How hard. Wait until you get to heaven. Can you tell me that?" I won't say how hard. That time was here where the boss boo people thinking is the end of everything. Brothers and sisters, your money, your education, your good life, your big house, your cars are not taking you to heaven. And we do not measure the blessings, the prosperity based on that. If they are message believers, God has blessed them with those material, those that do not have, they do not worship enough. When we go out, stop that thing. [Music] Amen. We know many men and women that were learned they've realized later that they could have just learned the Bible not the one in the university because the one in the university is temporal. I was looking at the document documentary. This man in the Titanic, that rich man, he said, "Let me give you money and give me a love boat so that I can be saved." Then this man said to him, "Money is not going to save us here. You, you and me are sinking now. The money is not going to save you. Your money was temporal. No wonder the Bible says the love of money is the root of [Music] all. Let's get into the new city. In the new city, you welcome by someone by the name of Peter who cannot even write his name. The foundation of the new city, amen, is the 12 apostles, the patent of Israel. When God said to the children of Israel, when you go in Egypt, in Babylon, in wherever they capture you, when they ask you, "What is your skill?" Just tell them, "We are shepherd." Okay. Don't tell them I'm a specialist psychiatrist. Psychiatrist. I've got I'm a professor in zoologology. Don't tell them. Just tell them I'm a shepherd and that's it. You're not a shepherd. Maybe it's because I I go to the suit every morning. Those people, they even smell like their [Music] sheep. But when we preach the message to them, putting those blankets, you just see them knotting their head. When when we leave, they just say, "I also want to be baptized. They've had a way for the pastor said you go and preach to the people that God has prepared and that's it. I don't need to pray hard. I don't need to stress myself. I remember the other day when we were in a place called Masatan, brother was baptizing the people. He was about to start. When he was about to start, four young men came running. We also went to the Lord here. I want you to pass because as you in a rush, those boys, we also came to be to be baptized. God is calling his children from all over. [Music] There is a city that we are going to the new city doesn't need our intelligence but it needs the internal intelligence that eternal intelligence that's what we need. Amen. Amen. I'm reading from the future home in spoken word. Amen. Brother says, "Why is it God so thought and cared so much about that little place called Palestine? See, when it's just a little spot, but right in there is where the temple is set. That's where the new Jerusalem will break. Then olive, mount olive shall cleave part to the right and the left. This way go that way. The other one this way. When she pushes up from beneath, he's calling about the city. No, not they say pushing apart like this but pushing up after Mount Olive give way there's some push in that day when it stand his holy feet upon the mountain on this throne 1500 miles 1500 miles. Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother said the other day, you were there when I was preaching to you telling you that I was measuring that thing. When brother Bren, brother uh when brother Nebuchadnezzar dream about the thing and brother Daniel interpret the theme, they saw brother me in the sea. John saw brother Brennan measuring the seeds. Let me tell you this. I don't know if I will be clear. You will understand it or not. When you try to catch things of heaven imaginary, you get lost. You just need to believe and know that God is in work. When brother Brenham was here on earth preaching the message living a normal life like everyone. Do you understand but his theophan was measuring the seed. look at him and he said the only person that can measure the seed and give me the answer is the Lord Jesus Christ. For the lamb is worthy to measure the city. The lamb is worthy you know to break the seals. One of the days brother Brham said you heard me when I say I measured the seal. brotherham the other day said I'm here this morning Sunday morning to open the seal for [Music] God I've seen people in Congo yeah they woriing brother they have the photo of brother they say this man if he's the one that opened the seal for the lamb. That means he's God. They worship brother right there in Congo. Amen. But brother Brenham said to John, "Bow not. I'm just one of you." Amen. Amen. I don't blame John. I don't blame the poor congalles. God want to reveal to them, he will reveal to them. But leave a message until the people want to worship you thinking you are God because they see the characteristics of God in you. You will be the one that say I'm just one of them. I am not God. But when they look at you, they see God. You talk like God. You walk like God until they say you are God. When brother heard them say that, he said to them, "Anyway, you are not far from the tree. A son of God is God. A son of chicken is a chicken of lamb is a lamb. Sheep is a lamb. A son of God is God. I am God." We are in the state of Adam. When Adam was in the garden of Eden, he had a control of everything. Amen. Everything comes under his subjection because he had authority. The only person that had authority is God himself. If he's God himself, we see the characteristics of him in a man. Oh God whom we worship is in this man then we shall follow this man. Amen. As the other people out there not always I have answer. Amen. Amen. They say you murals worship your pastor. Then I said to them you are not far from the truth. It happens to brother Brenham. Brother, I'm telling you this. Amen. If you follow a man of God, you end up being the beneficiary of what you follow. Let's not I I was telling the other message believers said, "Amen." I was telling to them you brothers you read Bible reverse what you start to read it right. Amen. Amen. The very same things that you believed you disbelieved. When Elijah saw what others couldn't see. What was that? It was God who chose him to see those things. Amen. And one day Elisha said to God, I see this thing alone. The people do not believe. Can you just show the young man as well? Amen. Amen. And then God showed the young man the unseen. He started to realize from that day, am I so protected from the host of heaven? The whole host of heaven. If someone can touch us or try to touch us, he will be eliminated immediately. From that day, that young man that was never the same again. He walked with confidence. You know if God one day can show you the real you on the other side, brother I have money or no money. Let them go. I will even give to the people. Take because the real me is up there. I'm longing to be up there. I'm longing to be in the new city. This thing happens to Paul again because Paul saw himself on the other side when he see himself on the took him 14 years. He was just quiet. He was just walking. He was just preaching. It's like but no way. If I can tell these people they will never understand. after 14 years my brothers they said what you see me here another Paul that is young who can see who is complete I saw him you know what the people will always react my will just pray for you because you really see things that are not seen and those things they don't even have God with him because you saw something that other people can't see. Sister, if you see the unseen hold to death, it's God who allowed them. If I don't see, I was not meant to see. If the others see, they meant to see what's wrong with them. Amen. Do you think do you know that the people that are met think you thinking you are normal you are met this man was met was eating in the dust he was preach the message the message he came to the church they give him suit they bath him he was a nice brother but one Hey, they found him eating the dust again. And he said to them, "This clean life of wearing tie and shoes, it's not for me. I'm enjoying here. What are you going to do with that person? You think you are mad while you think he is mad?" There are situation that you cannot change it. Everything that is happening, it has happened. Let me repeat myself. Everything that is happening has happened. They were like in a cage. They were in a plan of God. At the right time, God open and say, Adam, you start the race. Enoch, you will be the seven. Adam, you will leave your land. You will go and stand where I God will bring my new city. That is why when we sing, we sing about Abraham that he was looking for a city. When he was looking for a seed, he was going north, south, east, and west. But one day when he was walking, God was calling him. When he stopped, he met me, the king of that sea. When he met him, he said to Abraham, "Here is the holy place." Here, that's where the holy seat will come. Like you, blessed thou to meet me at the place called the future eternal. Amen. Amen. There are people that already have seen themselves beyond the kitten of time. You will look at their life. You look how they do things. You will see the things of this world. They are no longer holding them back because they've seen themselves beyond the c of time. The new city is the city eternal. Who do you think when was looking? He was looking at the people going out going in the in the gates coming out. When you close your eyes and imagine who are those people, you think it's the people you don't know. is the people you know and you are one of them saw you. Daniel saw you brother. That is why we are worshiping whom we [Applause] know. You know if you can worship in that way no one can do anything. Amen. Amen. Chapter 22. Revelation 22 is my last scripture. Oh, let me Yeah. Uh I was talking to the brothers. The message is 1 hour. Just few minutes I'm closing. Uh verse not 14. Yes. Verse 14. Revelation 22:14. And you jump to 17, 14, and 17. Amen. Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. 17 And the spirit and the bride say, come, and let him that heareth say, come, and let him that is a thirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Amen. Amen. Revelation chapter 22 closes everything is the end of everything. That's why even the Bible says those that do evil deeds continue. Amen. Why the Bible don't say those that do evil deeds must repent? Time of repentance is gone. Can I repeat myself? Those that do good continue. Those that do bad continue time of repentance is gone. Let me go back to my scripture. Blessed are you that do his commandments that you may have the right to the tree of life. The tree of life is Christ Jesus. The only people that have the access to the tree of life is the bride. Brother said there was a flaming sword that stopped the people to partake in the garden of Eden. But the flaming sword when the man of God was praying fell in his head and the word says this is the sword of the king. The one that stopped the people from entering is the one that will bring them in. the sword. That's why the word of God Bible says it can save. While it kills others, it saved others. I'm not talking about history. I'm talking about what is happening today. If you decide to leave this church, this sermon that I'm preaching even if can be wonderful sermon cannot stop you from going. No, you will go. I remember sometimes back those that are old will know what I'm talking about. Amen. The brother was coming here with a letter of leaving the church writing to the pastor and then he was rendering an item. He was so happy after the service after we are happy. Enjoy the message he was handing in the land. The message is not going to change you. This one I repeat it many times. The message can be wonderful. It's not going to change you. The way you are is the way you will be. Who are you for the message to change you? by God himself to Cain. God the creator of heaven and earth said to Cain, "Kain, you don't need to pray hard. You don't need to do anything funny. Just do like unto your brother." That was the message of the day. That was the ministry of the time. Do like unto your brother. You shall be received. But I'm not a brother's keeper. The only person I remember who uttered those words is the devil himself. I'm not my brother's keeper. Amen. Then he killed even after hearing the word of God. He killed. Who are you this morning after hearing a wonderful message and still hold you back? Brothers and sisters, if there's time to go, if there is time to go, you will go. Amen. Amen. Jesus said to Judas, Judas, Judas, is the time and the time is now. Try help you. He even look at the others. You can live as well. Amen. Amen. But one man said, "Whom shall we go? For the word of life are in you." And then Jesus said to me, "Blessed art thou." Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother Luke having the PhD but God did not give him the key. I'm not taking the PhD but he gave them to Peter whom cannot sign the church that I'm taking your PhD I'm just saying during that time the the the disciples they were doctors they were at they text. They were accountants. They were learned people. And God loved them so much. But he just took the keys of heaven. He said taxpayers, accountants, lawyers, physicians, this man will open for you. Our God is good. Amen. Hey, let me stop here. God bless you all. Let's sing unto the Lord. Amen. Amen. Let's sing a hymn. Love of God is greater [Music] than he grows beyond.

Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom he have crucified both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. God bless you my elder.
