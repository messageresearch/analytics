Description:
Title: Eating The Corn of the Land
Text: Don't Look to The Right nor to The Left
Preached by Elder Makgareetsa on 13 October 2024.

Exodus 3: 7 - 10 | Exodus 7: 1-4 | Acts 7:35 | Exodus 14: 15 | Joshua 5: 12-15

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about eating the corn of the land and that we should not look to the left or the right, but we should go straight forward.

God prepared the children of Israel for their departure, and He prepared Moses and also prepared Pharaoh. It is God who did everything before the foundation.

What is happening in your live is just the unfolding. God Said to Moses that He will prepare him as a god over pharaoh and God will prepare Aaron his brother as a prophet under Moses. Moses was born as a deliverer of the children of Israel. In life there are things that can hinder you but they cannot stop you to fulfil your purpose.

Before the foundation of the world God foreordained Moses as a deliverer. There is nothing that can stop Moses to deliver the children of Israel.
For you to see God's will and His way you should have been with God before. If you can see the Image of God, you cannot be contrary to His word.

God said to Moses, I am preparing you to have power and authority over Egypt. But there are people who will contradict Moses because they were not with Moses at the beginning. The children of Israel were supposed to say amen when Moses speaks, because he was God among them in that day. 

Some people murmur why did God make Moses god and Aaron a prophet and did not make me something.
The children of God are no longer in bondage of sin because they are free from sin. Because God is in us.

As a son of God, you must walk according to your purpose, don’t look to the sides because on the sides there's words of discouragement.

When God was talking to Moses that I am making you God He was talking to the inner man. That theophany in us should be the one speaking for us.

The elder read the following spoken words:

Church Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray [Music] amen bless you all very much thankful then we can read from the Bible we are reading the book of Exodus chapter 3 the book and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the hites and the jebusites now therefore behold I Cry of behold the Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptian oppressed them amen ver 10 first 10 saying come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou may bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt amen amen you may be [Music] seated we thank God for everything is not in you know normally I call him the Elder in the house we thank God for what he's doing for the children of God out there know Brahma City and other brothers were in Lim yesterday assist the children of God that side this morning we are together again God bless all the efforts the children of God are doing just want to tell you even myself the other day I was in the low fi we have that I told him after service that I'm so happy to see what is happening there you have a small Tabernacle there the of God came in numbers the tacle was well refurbished I saw it was well painted enough chairs you know everything was just going smooth the spirit of God was flowing then I say this is what we want message so at your area please pray for them amen amen because wherever the word of God is going there are fruits amen you know I'm a brief speaker going to take much of your time not even more than an hour but let's look upon what the scriptures said here my title this morning is about eating the corn of the land but my subtitle is what our pastor was saying the other day when was listening I conned this to this message because he said don't L to the right look to the left now the prophet says just speak and go forward amen that will be my subtitle don't look to the right to the left straight because you were born with a purpose don't let anyone hind you for the purpose that God Amen we we we see lot here amen verse S and the Lord said I have surely seen the application of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by the reason of their task Masters so I know their are sorrows amen amen so God has has had the Cry of Israel and he started to prepare them for the day of departure and God sent Moses he prepared the children of Israel he prepared Moses see again preparing phara amen amen so the entire world the entire life we live in this world everything has prepared by God himself you may think some of the things are not good things but God allowed them God prepared them for a certain purpose that you might not [Music] see let's sing a worshiping song Amen [Music] be [Music] ready Jesus [Music] ready be [Music] ready be [Music] ready ready [Music] Jus amen amen so we see God preparing everything and the Bible says everything was prepared by him before the foundation what is happening in your life is just the unfolding until brother Bram says even if I can take me to hell even if God can take me to I will still love him he's trying to tell you that there's nothing you can do but it's God who did everything before the foundation of the world he knew what you went through he has prepared you already amen amen if he has prepared you already and you know your purpose don't look to the left don't look to the right just walk on the purpose has called you amen amen let's read exod chapter 7 exod 7 verse 1 to 4 verse 1 to 4 and the Lord said unto Moses see I have made thee a God to faraoh and Aaron thy brother shall be thy Prophet Thou shalt speak all that I command thee and Aon thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh that he send the children of Israel out of his land and I will harden Pharaoh's heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt eypt continue but Pharaoh shall not hecken unto you that I may lay my hand upon Egypt and bring forth my armies and my people the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by great judgments amen amen so you see the previous verse God was telling Moses that I have heard the Cry of the of Israel but I've chosen you to be a deliverer but here where we just read he said to Moses it was part of the preparation of God God the creator of Heaven and Earth I will make you Moses god I will make you amen amen so I'm preparing you then I will prepare Aon your brother to be your Prophet you will speak to Aon Aon will speak to Pharaoh I will harden the heart of Phar some other people that are stubborn is God who their heart for a certain purpose because before the for of the world he has prepared he knew our end before our beginning that is God it it looks somehow when he said I will harden the heart of pharaoh it should be like that because he want to show his power that is why some of our diseases who allowed them so that we can see the power of God you have done nothing wrong but sometimes maybe you do not appreciate him enough he will put you in a situation where you will forcefully appreciate because he is God by so saying you no longer worry about yourself but you look up to God God knows everything about you amen amen faith is the substance spoken with is a substance spoken with spoken with it says and then they begin to cry to God for a deliverer is that right and they cried and cried and God for ordained a deliverer is that right that deliverer was Moses fored him foration of God ordination of God it happened before the foundation of the before the foundation of the world when God looked at Moses he saw him as the Deliverance nothing much nothing he was born to deliver the children of Israel to cross the Red Sea things may come negatively from both directions they are not going to hinder Moses in any way in any to deliver the children of God you know in a Christian Journey there are a lot of things that will hinder you but they are not going to stop your purpose so you must not look to the right you must not look to the left we must go on that's what our pastors told us those we shall even stand today go forward amen amen so it happens that way and those that ask for a deliverer and the deliverer came and they be against the Deliverance it's a human being because they think he must come in a certain way their way not the God's way because the God's way is always peculiar amen amen for you to see the God's Will and the God's way you must have been with God when he say let us make a man in our own image if you were with him you will see the image of God once you see the image of God canot be contrary be careful when we are contrary sometimes we might not have come to the same Source I'm speak about the Deep calling to the Deep when I speak and you speak Amen to the only man that contradicted the word of God is the devil he he contradicted the word of God he wanted to do better than God he found himself in a t area amen amen that is that man and that man has follow us if you follow him you will forever contct the word of God amen amen that is why God said to Moses I am preparing you to have power and authority over the entire Egypt every weight that you speak will come into existence because God bring things into existence then we see Moses going but there will be people that will be against the word of Moses because to begin with they were not with him am amen amen you know in our corporate out there we normally say we disagree to agree or agree to disagree but in the word of God is only believe have faith in God amen amen when God has spoken we respond positively something will tell you in the heart that this is right this is that says the Lord that's how the word of God is then Moses became God and when Moses is God the others mama why Moses is God why God made God and the prophet but that was the plan of God amen amen you you you cannot defy the word of God of God you just need to accept him you just need to sing this song where he leads me where he leads me the word of God is not like in our corporate meeting we argue the word of God is like when someone talk according to the word of God say Amen am amen that is one of the purpose the children of Israel were just supposed to say a they were supposed to say amen amen Moses has spoken because he's God amongst us he was the man in charge was listened to at that time amen amen until Moses had an headache when he was pulling them out of when he faced the Red Sea he wanted to see the psychiatrist the Physicians specialist because he was like is this thing possible I took them out of Egypt now they are against me now God responded to him and say Moses why cry speak there is time for prayer but there's time for speaking there's time for claiming When you pray is a good thing but when you claim you are in purose he gave us that Authority he was trying to tell Moses whatever you want to do will happen now he was trying to tell Moses you are God God is the Creator God knows everything when speak things come into existence amen amen and God said I will even Harden the heart of PHA it was not certain who hadn't is God because he want the entire world know that is God God created the Heaven the H and the under God created them no one the devil is one of the creation of is God who planned for him who put him in that place because he's got followers they will follow him to their doomed is God who prepared all those things so this morning whom are you going to BL if there's person to BL you caname God he the heart of made the prophet if you think he hasn't made you anything then can because God did everything we are just walking on the plan of God you know when you are a son in the you no long worry about the things of the of the world about even your own body but the only thing that you will say is to say father God you know all you know my tomorrow if someone knows your tomorrow you on that man the spoken with spoken obey the voice of the angel he said so if God raised up a man by the name of Moses had him born in this world for that specific purpose to deliver the people that were in bondage that couldn't help themselves he brought them out in fact not Moses Moses never performed one Miracle it was the angel of God that went before Moses the pillar of fire at night and Loud by day amen amen that was Moses and is something you cannot take out of him when brother Bram was on the scene he will be like Moses the angel of God was always ahead of me always guiding me was always saying I will talk when he's here I'm waiting for him do something because I cannot be ahead of the Ang of here first what he say that I can follow that was Moses and brother Bram in this time the people were coming to interrogate him before they giv start he tell them you are here for you want to interrogate me about this and this about the doctr and then the people were shuted the angel of God knows you tomorrow you cannot someone who knows tomorrow he may tell you before the sunet you are dead you will [Music] die saying just keep it not to set if they tell you that you'll go from Pillar To Post help even wanting to hold the [Music] because you with but that's a human being so God delivered the children of Israel when they were in B bondage and couldn't help themselves today God's people are not in bondage spiritually so they delivered by the power of the Holy Ghost no man to stay in bondage of sin any long because the Holy Spirit brings him from the bondage of sin that is the day we are living in we are free from sin we are no longer in bondage God is in us God is guiding us God lives in US amen every step of your life is God doing it as I said previously you are mechanic Dynam amen amen so brother BR when he was here on Earth God always guided him he became the waving she was just a normal human being like us but when he Liv every step was God guiding him you remember when he was still young God was talking to him that don't defile yourself with alcohol with smoking with girls and so forth as him being the human being and young one in that age check what happened you know as a person you want to test you want to check ever you are you understand and it appear precious we've got pray prees of our sons and look what God was doing to brother one day will try to walk out with boys and the girls when they about to start you know smoking or drinking that Holy Spirit will come like a when it get to him he will stop instantly run away and do the right thing it tells you this man he has an angel that is waying like Moses had an angel always guide as a child of God we've got angels are guiding us yes sir amen amen when you about to do something wrong something just tell you stop here that is the word of God that's how we live on a daily basis because repentance is for the children of God the Sinners does not repent repent from why because the life they live of the devil and the devil cannot repent when God the the heart of pharaoh respective of his CRI active of the condition in his worry he will be hardened by the of God God has done everything God has done everything if I'm right let me read this book why cist spoken with brother says today we are living or he say why do we worry it's a question why do we wonder why do we wait the only thing you can do speak and go for don't cry out say oh Lord is it your will to heal Today Show it your will as says the Lord it's his will you started to realize that you are not supposed to you're not supposed to cry you are not supposed to wait you must just go forward you know about that frog that were was going in a marathon amen amen they realized at the end that fr was death couldn't hear the word of discouragement any negative thing and everybody in the house knows that rabbit is faster than but one of the days they had to be on the race when they were in the race you know a rabbit is fast can go there come back and jump that is the rabbit that is its nature but the to was just in the line just walking that just working and then that rabbit was jumping going forth and back and even the people saying come but the tots was just going very slow you know who won the race T amen because tto the coach has just said you know T you are here you go there when you get there you won the race to said yes and then they say rabbit you go there the rabbit looking at the T knowing it nature this [Music] one you know even in the class if if my classmate are here they know there's this girl who committed suicide still in high school because when she read the exam she said if this one can pass definely must get distinction colors that one pass and she failed hang there are those people even this morning thinking that if this one can make to Heaven I will be in heaven be careful you might find yourself in you don't compare yourself with other person you have a purpose amen don't look to the other side the other side is the word of discouragement but the word of encouragement is when you listen to your coach when you listen to the word of God when listen to your pastor when he say go forward just go forward there will be people along the way trying to hinder you just just go forward it was he it was he the same God that was back there spoke to Moses and said to him why do you cry to me God asking Moses why are you crying to me I made you God bring things into existence do something you see if you can have a son and she cries when she's still young teen eight still crying and you take him to University still crying you know getting into the marriage still crying even the wife don't know what to do with him you just realize I just accomp you know there are those people with Gray beard crying like just the sisters don't tell us but sometimes you look at their husband is this man a child or a child being a man it happens in life so that was God to Moses you have everything speak I will say so be it amen amen spoken with Paradox but it's in the line of duty when God has commanded you to do something like he said to Moses speak cry speak to the children IE my message is eating the corn of the land but I'm I'm saying look go forward you must come to a place where you take the responsibility you should come to a place where you put your foot down and say come what me nothing is going to shift me from the position that God has put me then you are responsible then you are like Moses amen amen you no longer crying you took your position and know what to do amen amen uh the spoken with spoken with and time and time and time before we read and time let's eat the corn of the land let's see Joshua because Joshua is one man who put the people in their places amen Joshua chapter 5 Joshua 5 12- 15 Joshua 5: 12-5 and the man assist on the marrow on the tomorrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel Mana anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canan that year and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over again him against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him are thou for us or for our adversaries and he said n but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what sayth my Lord unto his servant and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua lose thy shoe from off thy feet for the place where on thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so amen God richly bless you and the man sees on the after they' eaten the land amen amen the Mana sees why the Mana sees is because they were eating the Mana when they were crying oh Lord God we are hungry than the man amen amen oh Lord we are thirsty and the water come from the rock so the children of Israel from you know Egypt they were crying in the land they were crying they pass Jordan God said you are on your own stand for what you believed this is an example to us today stand for what you believe you are on your own the crying time the Ming time has stopped we now eat the corn of the L the cor of the land is when you exercise that Authority that God has given to you and if you do not do it what will come and ask you why cry speak bring things into existence what do you want check what you want you shall be given you can't be forever on there are other people this Sunday life next suay when are you going to eat the corn of the when are you going to exercise The Authority when I want to believe God In Action when God is in action not with another brother or another sister it's when he's doing that in you brother said to us there was a day when he hear the voice from the cave from the cave from the river from the tree but he said the day I hear that way Within Myself I said Lord God you made it this is the most wonderful time because that voice from the tree from the cave from the river is now in me if that was God talking to me now God is in me from today going forward I am God I am the voice of God maybe that's why God has visited him and revealed the unto him because he said one of the day here today to open the seals for God but the Bible says no one was worthy but we see brother open them we are the beneficiary today and time and time and you remember the man from that day until they entered into the promised land and the holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost will never cease falling on the T on the church will never Cee falling on the church till the Millennium Jesus come in power the old again if you notice as soon as they Cross Jordan me separation from the Earthly journey into the other land which was spiritual thing SE and they eat the old coin they eat of the fruit from the land again in the Millennium see we are eating spiritual manner but we'll be back won't need spiritual manner in that time we will eat the fruit of the vine again and of the filled the cor and the Bible says we will build houses and [Music] inhabit plant vine yards amen plant vineard and eat the fruit of them when we come into the Millennium the Thousand Years of rest then will be Wars and trouble and sickness and death will flee from the world will return here on Earth on this Earth and be with Christ A Thousand Years right here before we go into the glory that is the teaching of the scripture now the children of Israel when they are in Canaan they were in the promised land promised land they have to be in their position they have to be in their purpose need to know their standpoint in the way they need to build houses they need to plant vineard and us in the Millennium it was exactly like that so when they were there they worked for it the ministry Chang the ministry has changed when the ministry has changed and you are part of the ministry you will start to realize something has happened we are in another level so you go with the amen amen you no longer worry what happen behind you no longer worry about what is happening with you but you are looking forward because you have been called for a do you know that there are certain people they were just born to complain and they doing doing it very nice even if you say nice things they will just complain and be negative and they started to realize that they were born for that because we never had them talking anything positive now I saw them my work premises I've seen if you see them stay there the corner if you do some presentation this one is just talking nonsense like I prepared for the whole night but this is becoming nonsense but okay say something good this one is just undering us that's when you realize and start to observe that individual he's just like that I wish there's none here the great warrior Joshua brother says now when Joshua was over there walking after the crossed over Jordan they start to to eat the Earth and I can imagine Joshua that morning after getting this great vision of the Lord saying I will be with you just like Moses so will I be with you called him one night and said now look Joshua give him a vision and say now my Serv Moses day rise and go over Jordan thou and all the of Israel and the Lord thy God will be you no man remember that no man shall stand before thee all the days of your life as I was with Moses so will I be with you only be good character just focus and do not be discouraged just keep on moving I will be with you every place you set the soul of your feet is a possession for you he if we were like Joshua this morning knowing that nothing can stand before we will have more courage and what I like about God said I will be with you but this this morning he will not be with us he will be in us if he's in us when we walk is him walking using our body we need to allow to be the above all the human race this is the most greatest age where God is Not with us where God is in US brother Bram say all the years I heard him I've seen the angel Paul Paul saw it but the moment I realized that this in me it was the closing of the chapter amen amen it is the rising of the sun spoken way Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was a wave over the people and the first time they will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the we has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same sign and wonders that he did back then now the spoken with more events made clear by prophecy the man of God says we are not living in Pentecostal age we are living in another AG we are not living in a method this church we are living in another age we are living on up to the bright age the calling out of the church and getting it together for the Rapture that's the great age that we are living in to my honest opinion that exactly the truth the man of God is putting an assurance to you that the AG came and passed they came and passed but we know until laudation church and church age was the age of Pentecostalism but the age we are living in is the bright age the bright age means of everything anytime we will be gone amen amen I like the game when the pastor say we are on the runway amen amen when you are on the runway that plane does not have a reverse even if you can say I love something and this and this you are on the runway it goes we are in that plane we are going beyond the sky you remember brother when he was saying when the tube of the astronauts going up once it's shoot up there's no RSE because we have hit the point of no return when someone is dying when someone is dying he hit the point of not return you started to realize that you are no longer going back you are going forward if you are sinner you cannot come back to this life again before you die there will be that moment that you cannot change it's happening before your departure even if you like to you will never return back to to life again because you have hit the point of no return at the moment the pyramid has gone up and there is a point of no return the Bible the last chapter of Revelation say the children of God Will Remain the children of God will remain a sen a holy one will remain a one an evil one an evil one will remain an evil one that is this time we are living amen whereby we are already hooked in when you are inside you no longer listen to what the people says outside you have seen your redeemed my redeem once you have SE there no matter you have the most expensive car you no longer worry the most expensive house a lot of money that you acquired amen amen as they were talking about this man who was after money was working very hard and then the moment he tried to say let me relax and enjoy he realized is the end of him then he started to realize that the things of the world are just the things of the world and the man of God says anything that you can see with a naked is temporal it has a beginning has an end even your body was born in 19 so and so maybe 2020 that will come to an end because can see with the naked let's thank God this morning there's a body within us that never age the body that processed from God never created never formed never born of a man and a woman that is the one I'm talking about is the one that will enjoy but here yes we've got chronic whatever go to the call Doctor consult and this we are trying to keep it I have this angle of mind I have him still alive he love me and I love him so much I saw him the other day uhh just like the more you are joking the more you getting old this when I'm with the brothers in Li we nor talk about the health washes but you must eat health okay but I'm just saying the more you eat healthy the more you get old it tells you you cannot Bank on this Bo let's Bank on that other Bo but I hope you understood me I don't say Don't eat healthy let's continue eat healthy the more eat healthy that body inside is the one that God this one has a beginning it will have an end when we pray we pray for our inner peace we pray for our inner body because this one you can pray for its healing today and tomorrow we announce your departure let's come out a little bit and put our lives on that life eternal our innermost being the one that we rely on because God himself I hope you heard the pastor when he say our real being was processed from God if something processed from God Is God When Mo when when God talked to Moses that I made you God he was talking to the Inner Man was talking to his soul because this one out was not worthy to be God because it can have interrogation with [Music] and amen amen when they were interrogating here it was here but when Moses apply who thought was was beyond the flesh should be in instances whereby apply what is in us that real that for us amen amen we are living in the bright age the bright age is the last age the cing of the Stone close us we are sealed in the things of the world is what they talk about is what they can see they do us no har we are in another level whereby we amen amen even if they can say fish can climb the tree wow what what is you somebody tells you that are you going to come here and cry and what other people say the fish can CL you'll go to a psychc or having depressed yourself because you worry about something that you really worry about if the fish climb the tree is for them you are inside the pyramid and you are going up and the more you go up the noise of the world cannot be he anymore like that EG when he's going up couldn't hear the noise of other P when they start to follow they were full of tears in their eyes because they couldn't reach where the eag is the Eagle's way the Eagle's work is to fly higher the moment it goes It goes until this one complaining you remember I gave you this story the other day the other complain and then the Ang said I don't know I just see myself when I flip my wings I see myself here when I flip my wings again I see myself on another level when I flip again I'm to the highest level until I couldn't see you again and then this one was saying no you must come down here you must play with us that's when the devil tried to draw you back but you as an angle F they will talk about you fly they will complain about you go to the highest [Applause] level God bless you amen amen amen don't look to the right don't look to the left go straight it's what our Pastor said that thing is still winning in my this is true Hallelujah am let's
