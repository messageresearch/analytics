it not in the spoken way but why people are talking against it so much do they fear something [Music] amen amen because every time complaining about us preaching Under World when last did you hear us preaching that amen amen now we are going to revisit for for this people maybe they don't understand that it is in the spoken don't you know of theor that is in the Bible okay amen we'll come and show you that it is in the Bible okay amen well as we bow where our Elder we say prayer let us pray gracious Lord once again father it is through your mercy that we could bow our heads with Holiness in our heart Holiness of the full weight that has been revealed and Lord Almighty in the time that we are living in we just sang a song that said I'll be ready yes Lord being Overcomers we we are already ready Lord knowing that you came to the Jews Lord Almighty to manifest the word and Lord Almighty you are you are in us now the Gentiles to manifest that word now the manifested word Lord is within us Lord and as we are about to read that word there's our pastor Lord behind the pull pit gracious Heavenly Father we know that you have anointed him and we know Lord Almighty that you have Sanctified him to bring that word we are always happy Lord Almighty to know that you descended from eternity having that book Lord Almighty that Pillar of Fire Lord and gave it to the prophet and father the prophet gave him to a man behind the pull pit father we believe that because even Paul gracious heavenly father said we should believe them and love them Lord Almighty even our Prophet said we should pray for them Lord father we pray for our pastor Lord Almighty believing that Lord is a vessel that is going to teach the way today Lord May our hearts Lord Almighty be open because you once said to the Pharisees that they hate you they want to kill you because there is no place in their hearts Lord for your word Lord Believers coming from different places Lord open their hearts Lord Almighty that this word must find a place in their heart father thank you Father as we are about to read it and as the pastor is about to preach about it Lord Almighty may we have that Revelation Lord Almighty thank you Father binding all the evil spirits the devil and his angels Lord Almighty because Lord Almighty we have power the revealed word has given us power to cast him out we are here as Believers without any devil we don't need any demon here Lord Almighty but we know that that has already been taking place Lord your word has been taking place Lord thank you Father take control Lord of everything here in the precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ amen Lord amen amen you may be we are thankful amen I was yeah we have to read yes amen uh before you read I was trying to say yesterday uh yes yesterday uh sister me and uh she said uh I'm coming and uh I said you are welcome because even last time I think I didn't mention her name even now I won't B but she said she's experiencing something every time she sees fire then he said now this since now the Rapture is coming and I'm looking at you and I see this thing time and [Music] again fire fire fire then I contined to tell her that it's not fire like this one we have even the prophet says sometimes we will b a billion years or what but it wouldn't be an eternal thing because only only the Christians have got eternal life amen amen amen now my Prophet say yes there is hell he says it can take millions of years somebody burning but it is not Eternal it take millions or billions of years amen since ever Judas went down the bottomless he's still rolling amen now this Sister Sister of yesterday yesterday or day before yesterday I don't know she said one time but what is that cycle of Darkness and I said where she says I've seen it and then I said did you ask the elders there or whosoever is responsible did you in about that what is it we are not allowed to ask any question [Music] if they don't tell you about it don't try to ask now I I said to her you know do you know about the bottomless pit terrible okay amen a p darkness and the people today they just don't care they don't know what is Hell only if they knew they would run to the Lord Jesus Christ only if you can know what is you will run to the Lord Jesus Christ all right we'll come to that H waiting for the children of God all over all places just count them and or mention them Jerusalem Jerusalem Bethlehem Bethlehem amen amen hey it's going to be a big that meeting in that meeting Paul will be there pH Willer Will Be [Music] There amen [Applause] way know [Applause] you is [Music] amen [Music] amen over to there amen to Revelation 2 amen verse 17 he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches Amen to him that overcometh will I give to it of the Hidden Manner and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written amen which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen is that one scripture or two two okay Revelation 19: [Music] 11-13 and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself self amen and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God Amen you may be seated God bless you uh that piece of I had a a piece of paper here from the a piece of paper that was no okay I think it is okay I will find it the piece of paper uh the quotation that I ask for now I don't see no it's bigger than that one God bless you all right all right now we are we are here again this morning we are thankful to God [Music] the Lord willing when we live here we will find ourselves in leoon there's a pastor there Pastor Mak amen amen so they have arranged for us okay anyhow it's not time for the to report about this things now we all know about them we we'll be going there all right um last we ask a question about the Battle of amagon I wonder this who are asking talking about underworld under don't they know what is the underworld okay they don't know do they know about the coming of the battle of no all right amen but today I will read for few minutes about the just to finish up some part of this white amen amen and that one it is very impossible to impersonate because impersonation is everywhere now the reason being that uh John Wason to come up and Prophet told us that was after the seven Church ages I mean he he has seen the seven church amen because you can only be sumon up after you have seen because seven churches speak of time amen amen now he Wason to come up after he has seen the time he seen that time of the church ages because if you uh we are going back you are going back to the church ages you are only going to continue with a [Music] reputation but as the prophet said the seventh seal is the end of the time of all things amen amen amen and uh there are some people that are still waiting for the revelation of the seventh season but we'll come with that to show that seven seal was revealed but if you are still residing in churches time of the churches amen amen you are not in line with the revelation of God because according to the word of God the seven seal which we will come will read some things and to show that the seven seal is was revealed amen let's wait for that we are we are talking about it every day but only you cannot impersonate that amen that's why the prophet said John the message came to John and said come up and I will show you to to come now if you are told that you hear that word I will show you things to come meaning the past will remain the past meaning the there's another he says I'll show you the things that say it all right here Amen brother you remember even 20 Page I mean chapter 21 21 amen uh let me make sure that I'm trying to C the right thing amen it say where it says come up that was joh and I will show you the bride Revelation 21 yes verse 9 M and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God Amen okay amen I will show you the bride it is himself who introduced the bread and even here I am glad to worship here because I I heard him introducing the bride who is the bride of Christ I'm not talking about the Mage Church talking about the bride amen amen so the bride has the weight as my Prophet says she is Alpha and Omega now Alpha and Omega that is the wife of Christ all right amen did you read that amen no and he says also the bride comes twice amen all right amen and uh that's why now we are not in a message church because the so churches some even they hate one another that can't be the the bride of Christ is like Christ amen amen and she doesn't impersonate she she's receiving from the husband that's why he said be therefore if God is Holy then he will be worshiped by a holy person amen if you are a child of God it says then you are like him if God doesn't tell lies his child cannot tell us amen if God can sin his son this child cannot [Music] s if the Lord Jesus Christ don't appear on social media social media tell me that thing what is that brother if God don't appear on Instagram his child will never we as the children of God we don't want to see ourselves we want to see amen you know uh you remember that story told by a sister some years back said there was a young man who got lost he couldn't find his way back home now people were trying to help this young man to find her way back but we that's when I was at the Assemblies of God church when this mama told the story then it was a testimony she was giving then she said and uh this [Music] boy uh the police were trying to help him find his way back but when the news of this Lost Boy appear on the papers then they say another somebody offered to help then he went to I think it was police what what years back when she arrived it was a woman woman when she arrived there she said I know this and they said okay tell us he this I saw him somewhere where he resides there's a sign of a cross there somewhere there and this boy started to say show me the cross he said show me the cross that cross then once I see that cross then I would have arrived amen amen amen that's how he happened to return home that's why we are going back home show us the cross show us the seals that is our way back [Music] amen so we come we arrive at the sign after a sign all right amen and one thing if you you are from God then God will show you the way back home this ministry of the seven amen amen it is on the I can't say on the board okay but it is God to his children speaking to his children am amen his children no hatred they have sh because they have seen something better [Music] you can only leave something after you have seen something better than okay amen uh I wake up early in the morning morning we are watching the SS amen amen some people don't care about what the Lord has said they ask him about the sign of his coming and he he said as it was in the time of Lord as it was in the time of no so shall it be right amen and then the people he has spoken to they can see those signs amen but only only those he has answered it shall be like this now those people today they say or they are saying in their preachings and so forth this is what the Lord Jesus has spoken spoken about these things that they will happen in the end of time but others they don't care about that because he was not talking to them the only people message who receives the message not just a teaching but life the message now do you know that these are the people that H him amen this seven SE message is the message of the people who have amen let me say to you again the Samaritan woman who told her that when when the Messiah comes he will tell us all things who told her that and brother say that woman and others they didn't say it from here am okay before we close the message that we preach we didn't hear it from here [Applause] amen amen it is the message that God prepared for those who love him then said in the last days amen amen it's a message that was put aside amen for a certain time for certain people amen that's why I was reading even yesterday when the prophet said you have heard from you sit down and check that you have heard from your theop because your real body it's not this one not real body will come to that to look at this bodies the prophet told me that and you he told you about it you have another body amen this this sister um yesterday she said she want me to she want to come she wants to come so that I can pray for her and she's talking about the people that are against but she says but you you have two bodies I said that means god is busy with this girl she said you've got two bodies and that's why I want to come to you to help me out all right am now if you have two bodies what does that mean because your theop is not preaching a church stuff am and your hearing is not that of a human being I'll bring it the prophet spoke about that about your hearing we can read the same thing and only that one and that one will understand [Music] uh if a person don't understand it means you have spoken to you have spoken to that person something let me put it right as the prophet says you have heard from your [Music] okay amen he didn't say you here because you are educated education is not a of the world that's why the people people today who boast of their education they are misleading the people if they come to church uh this money what money ritual money ritual but the preaching oh oh Prosperity Prosperity Prosperity Prosperity Prosperity is preached by educated people [Music] all right amen uh the seventh seal if they say you have received the seventh seal that mean you have finished the course that's right amen now we don't receive the the word through Reading no you receive from God then you read about [Applause] it why Peter said H after some of the people they left Jesus the Jesus and they said I who can hear his preachings so they went but Peter said where shall we go now when we live the service right now some people are taking different directions where are you going brother Bram says if you once you hit seven then what where are you going all right am because if you hit seven that's def Finishing Line okay amen like today we are just waiting for the Rapture I don't know about you but with me I I'm just waiting for the rupture I don't see any other thing I don't see the world some that this world will offer me something amen amen you know H if you can see in the evening towards the evening I used to sit and watch the [Music] bed no one can keep time like the we have WR watches and so forth but still we can't keep time but that bed has no rest watch but it can keep tight amen amen did you see that amen every day I used to watch them this time will pass at certain certain time you'll see them together amen [Music] amen now they are not churches no they have heard him speak now they follow him every day you see them going this way tomorrow again they come this way they go back again like that am it is almost like like us all right amen we are here but we don't belong here is that right amen that's why we go to the service just to go we are not church goers a church goer is a person who comes to church and go back with hey the church was so nice amen amen that's that far but a predestinated seed one Simon speaks to H him the things he has experienced in hisop theop is not this body is not this big head that's why he says you have heard from it's nothing it's something amen amen hearing there's different kinds of you'll see when we will we shall come to read where the Prophet says if you go beyond the dimensions you hear the brother singing that song changing yeah changing Dimensions amen yes amen mhm amen changing Dimensions yes dimension because you will only Stu somewhere if you go with somebody who loves beer or marijana and you arrive the people drinking it's easy to lose him amen amen coming but a child of God let me tell you something amen didn't the Bible say uh we I'm still coming to the White Stone the Bible says he who hates his brother let me repeat he who hates his brother he who hates his sister sister [Music] what's the answer he is like he he's talking about a person like if he says K the first man to kill was now if it says He Who hat his brother it's like he doesn't say he hates because [Music] of no he says he is lying the original killer is that right amen okay amen now let us continue for few minutes that's why I was reading even recently the day of redemption okay amen and the people are preaching it day of redemption day of redemption amen amen but which day is this we don't do you have a calendar that tells you that the day of redemption is on such and such amen amen and where the people will start running two and trying to make things right you will never that's why the Lord Jesus knowing that we couldn't redeem ourselves became himself without sin to shed his blood and he knew that the only gospel will come through his blood because the blood of Jesus that's why he's a Kingsman and it says we were Redeemed by whom right I said D people were wondering why now it seems like Pastor is making Jesus our friend now because it says brother is because they say what a friend I have Amen in Jesus am my friend people can hate you the whole world but as long as you have Jesus amen amen it won't bother you if you have Jesus as your friend then you own all you have all because in Jesus we have found all that's why they say Give Me Jesus and that's enough for me I need I don't need Jesus End Amen he is everything he's everything he everything to me is everything everything he everything to me he's my father my sister my father and my mother he a everything to me amen amen he naturally I can't show you somebody and say this is my blood do you know my family I I mean in this way have you seen my father my mother or you've just seen her but where is where is she [Music] do you know she's not with me if I say mother I have my mother passed on is that right now but I have something Eternal that cannot pass away and God made it he made it this way if talking about the Kingman Redeemer this Gospel of the seals it makes you one with God the whole world can live amen but the king man cannot leave you that's why he came shed his blood and he it is impossible God to leave [Applause] you amen amen amen because you are of the bloodline the person of the bloodline not forced to do anything that's why the the prophet of God say your pro your theop you have heard before you have heard it doesn't say you are going to hear no that means what is preached to you you have already heard amen amen am that's why if the way comes to you is just amen [Music] that's and you you you are not struggling to do the will of God no because your is the will of God amen amen you know I we read the books especially uh those who know me they know even I I sometimes I don't sleep or I sleep early in the morning even even today early in the morning all right why because a real Christian ra his [Music] Bible he read spoken spoken ween when you come preach by Revelation he but can you hear what he says because he says you have heard that's why you here amen you remember that part we have read he speaks about the fourth dimension you know radios all those things amen amen of which the children of today they are not going anywhere unless by predestination because of these things that are happening you won't even find a child because the moment they start to hear they hear these things of the world amen amen now that's why the true Christianity is something you have heard amen amen that's why he says you have heard from your now if somebody comes with something different you don't hear him or her because you have heard from your now I will tell you that I'll keep this one I have heard from my the because theop is light and the that's God in plural amen that's why he says this body is [Music] subject to the word of God Amen all right amen there's something in you pulling you every time you want to read the Bible the spoken way because because inside there is something pulling you something is pulling you amen waiting for the Rapture is not like waiting at the bus stop you have Peter why you are still remaining While others are have left [Music] Lord where shall we go you know your Christianity should arrive at that place without this word where shall I because that is his or her place she has from woman how do you know that when Messiah come he will tell us she has H from [Music] her Peter also said Lord where shall we go because it is if it is in your the you are just like Peter there's no other place for you even if you can go all of you but the person who has H from the will [Applause] remain Lord where shall we go for the words of eternal life with you amen the king's man that's why I I have this here hold that word Redemption until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed meaning that the day of redemption until that's what the prophet says day that day of redemp redemption let me start Redemption until the day that book of redemption is revealed amen who has the wa Redemption because I'm I'm closing he's he's reading this grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until that's why when you come you can't get lost because when the boy was lost but when when he met that Mama that Mama mentioned the cross amen amen let me say while closing here Christ is your King's man [Music] Christ is your kings man you remember brother amen [Music] when Princess Diana died yes I said that uh there was [Music] news amen amen big news because she was a queen no there was another a newspaper that came out with certain news there somebody who were recording from that house of the the the Royal House then he said now they said those who received the news from this man who who went to the Royal house it was on a newspaper d uh what do you say about it's the inside inside what about inside the the report from the Insiders right it says it was written like that a report from the inside today we need a report from the Insiders [Applause] the family man he was born there he of the blood L now that's why we need to hear we have a redeemer who is not just a redeemer but he is an Insider he is one of us that's why we couldn't be saved by any other blood should be the blood of the king's that makes us one with him amen all right that's why when they come they say where shall I go amen Peter there's so many places you can go to Dubai but he said where he had nowhere to go because the blood of the Kings man makes makes him also to be K with him amen all right amen now that's why we can't go [Music] anywhere why I want to hear from the [Music] [Applause] king the family men amen amen the there so many even today churches are full up to pakist pakist things like that but where shall I go you that you don't belong to a [Music] church but you are k the king's man amen amen he's not coming to choose we were chosen before before you appeared before you you were born he has chosen you already how by his blood [Applause] [Music] amen hey he has chosen You by his blood so that have you seen siblings amen amen uh yes siblings of the same bloodline together have you seen when they live together this one will defend this one even if he is wrong you hear him say like something like this your brother owes somebody and do somebody meet your brother your brother the first thing you to my younger brother Jud already in judgment but you haven't heard why is he slepping amen amen I don't want to hear anything now the blood line of Christ is not like that that's why now I'm glad I am redeemed [Music] amen if you are not redeemed you just become a church member and when they redeemed started to bring things that brought them up according to the bloodline you'll say now you see they've started amen amen we were talking brother and together with the brothers it is like that I've seen one of God when I was still at Assemblies of God now a child does something wrong and the when they trying to discipline him or her even the parents know that brother this brother has wronged their son now love the real is the love of God Amen love among each other this sister loves this one this and brother love God is love we together and it's it's hey I used to go with some brothers we were a group and you were singing amen amen so there was one who was close to me every time when we meet now always I'm happy that going to talk we are not going to talk about anybody we just going to play [Music] music we are going to say the py gates will open so that I can enter in for he purchased my Redemption and forgave me all my sin amen amen to our feet amen hey the gates will open so that I may enter in so he purchase my salvation all right amen now have seen that are being opened the seven seal another gate all the revelations that God has blessed us with we we go through the G amen am people can talk but when God speaks to you it's something else amen amen they were saying he's still the same Jesus he Remains the Same that's why I will always stay with him because he's always the same man can do this today tomorrow he taking another route child of God will never never take another once he is pred because he is predestinated amen amen you know brother uh
