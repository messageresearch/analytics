[1:41:39] [Music]
[1:41:41] you know yeah I think it's
[1:41:44] as I have said already three days back
[1:41:48] I was
[1:41:51] you know before three days before we
[1:41:53] went on a busborough
[1:41:57] I was reading something
[1:42:01] and I I
[1:42:05] put on the
[1:42:08] what's name
[1:42:10] I I wanted to hear to listen to a song a
[1:42:14] special song
[1:42:18] hey you know my my song
[1:42:25] Lord Jesus come foreign
[1:42:47] now I was I was I was having a view of
[1:42:52] you or less you are seated like this
[1:42:58] [Applause]
[1:43:01] and
[1:43:03] you know you you look to me like a
[1:43:07] Eternal business
[1:43:11] [Applause]
[1:43:16] we are really here not to support
[1:43:18] Brothers
[1:43:34] now before God can do anything with you
[1:43:40] he has to
[1:43:43] establish a covenant
[1:43:49] now
[1:43:51] worship God
[1:43:53] if it is
[1:43:57] he is just to us just a god
[1:44:14] it is the carbon the cabinet
[1:44:18] and that keeps yes
[1:44:23] it is
[1:44:26] you don't have the choice of yourself
[1:44:44] they don't train things
[1:44:51] so the children of Israel they could be
[1:44:55] in Egypt
[1:44:56] but they could not drain anything
[1:45:00] because they were under a coverage
[1:45:04] if they suffer they suffer still alive
[1:45:07] [Applause]
[1:45:11] so everything they've done God
[1:45:16] said about them
[1:45:18] I will establish
[1:45:24] a covenant binds God
[1:45:31] to take you over the red seats
[1:45:39] that that binds God
[1:45:43] and yeah that's why he will say
[1:45:46] he comes to you accordingly
[1:45:52] not because
[1:45:56] [Music]
[1:46:06] forever

[1:48:04] subject

[1:48:09] I looked into it
[1:48:12] time and again
[1:48:14] to say
[1:48:18] I'm under a covenant
[1:48:22] by grace
[1:48:27] somebody's going to is Page Three
[1:48:33] some let me come to it
[1:48:36] and
[1:48:40] I I was looking at 325 it will it is
[1:48:44] supposed to be three page three
[1:48:46] something here
[1:48:48] let me remind you so that you will know
[1:48:51] the page
[1:48:54] the prophet says
[1:48:59] that's 325. 33 25
[1:49:03] . in this old book of mines
[1:49:12] but you will know
[1:49:16] a new version of the book of Hebrews
[1:49:19] where it is
[1:49:21] in this one is 325 page 325 paragraph
[1:49:26] 211
[1:49:28] and it's Christ
[1:49:31] we are repeating
[1:49:33] it's Christ that God looks at not you
[1:49:38] question is
[1:49:46] yeah
[1:49:48] and then it's Christ
[1:49:51] so if those no fault in him
[1:49:57] how can they be formed
[1:50:01] how can he find fault when you are dead
[1:50:05] and your life is hid in Christ
[1:50:11] [Music]
[1:50:14] cannot find the fold in himself
[1:50:22] and shall I repeat that
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:27] amen
[1:50:37] it's not a human makeup
[1:50:42] maybe saying we have prayed we have
[1:50:46] fasted known

[1:50:51] Covenant our highest

[1:51:42] this this to me
[1:51:44] no a person under a covenant
[1:51:48] who doesn't care whether you have done

[1:54:41] just a type
[1:54:42] yeah he was talking with some other
[1:54:45] brothers
[1:54:47] okay
[1:54:54] then immediately after that
[1:54:56] [Music]

[1:55:48] directions
[1:55:56] and then so I look at him he was trying
[1:56:00] to go that way
[1:56:02] I said hello brother

[1:57:02] there must be God's system
[1:57:06] for keeping the city

[1:57:16] life is in him
[1:57:19] he is our Christ Our Life
[1:57:23] no not breathing
[1:57:26] no that is not life that is for this
[1:57:30] body
[1:57:31] but in Christ
[1:57:34] our life
[1:57:36] amen amen now if Christ is your life
[1:57:40] that means
[1:57:53] okay
[1:57:57] uh let me attend to this
[1:58:05] book
[1:58:10] the
[1:58:15] I think is that's something that I was
[1:58:18] looking for I think that's what you
[1:58:19] watch that is 380 because this book
[1:58:23] okay no we'll come to to that I don't
[1:58:27] know whether it's referring to this one
[1:58:29] yeah it's Christ that God looks at it
[1:58:35] not you sing when
[1:58:42] which book is this
[1:58:44] okay it could be just read it from this
[1:58:49] one and it's Christ that looks at not
[1:58:53] you amen amen in this one is Page 325
[1:58:59] another version yeah
[1:59:03] they correspond is the same thing
[1:59:07] you see the brother is in the uh
[1:59:11] and they're not asleep
[1:59:13] amen
[1:59:17] and it's Christ
[1:59:19] that God looks at it
[1:59:25] I mean we are coming to that
[1:59:28] it's Christ
[1:59:30] so if there is no fault in him
[1:59:35] how can they be full
[1:59:38] how can he find fault when you are dead
[1:59:45] [Music]
[1:59:47] Israel is that the thing and your life
[1:59:51] is hit in Christ
[1:59:56] through God
[1:59:58] sealed by the Holy Ghost
[2:00:02] they that are born of God
[2:00:05] does not commitment
[2:00:09] amen born of God
[2:00:13] for you cannot sing
[2:00:16] the Bible says that is born of God
[2:00:19] cannot
[2:00:23] God

[2:00:38] if you are born of an African
[2:00:41] Africa you can claim yourself the way
[2:00:44] you want but you are an African

[2:28:04] then I
[2:28:06] sometimes when reading yeah
[2:28:21] even so come Lord Jesus Christ some
[2:28:26] people hate it
[2:28:28] they don't
[2:28:31] they are not expecting him
[2:28:38] if we had that power
[2:28:41] to pull him down
[2:28:45] we would have done that already
[2:28:50] happened but fella we are saying even so
[2:29:00] come and take yours
[2:29:03] okay we are learning to go
[2:29:07] Arena
[2:29:10] what are we here for
[2:29:13] you we have done his will
[2:29:16] amen amen and then
[2:29:19] what we came for
[2:29:23] we are trying to fulfill
[2:29:28] his his will
[2:29:30] amen amen like that Soldier
[2:29:34] we have done what we were sent to do
[2:29:40] because
[2:29:49] they will be shouting Dancing in Heaven
[2:29:54] he says if you don't love noise don't go
[2:29:58] to heaven
[2:30:06] me also I thought that heaven is a place
[2:30:10] where you enter with a candle like
[2:30:18] even when coaching somebody
[2:30:23] but there's no question don't take
[2:30:25] tables with you this is
[2:30:31] now I thought that some people think
[2:30:36] having to be like that
[2:30:41] and there's something that yeah
[2:30:43] they are doing their own things
[2:30:48] like maybe if you are a child of a
[2:30:50] pastor

[2:35:13] I thank God
[2:35:15] we do not worship in vain

[2:35:26] for the Bible says we are the citizens
[2:35:30] and now there was there's a migration
[2:35:34] of the children of Abraham
[2:35:37] will come to that the migration of the
[2:35:42] children of Abraham and when he was
[2:35:45] looking for a city
[2:35:47] the prophet saying thank God for Malachi
[2:35:52] thank God for the seventh angel
[2:35:55] messenger
[2:35:58] Abraham Abraham arrived at a literal
[2:36:01] place

[2:36:54] let's read this last part
[2:36:58] keeping the seed
[2:37:00] who are alive
[2:37:05] and now I will read this part
[2:37:09] by seven
[2:37:12] sevens
[2:37:14] but this others
[2:37:18] because they've got their own cleanse
[2:37:21] they've got their own systems
[2:37:24] that's why it's by two
[2:37:27] but those who fall under
[2:37:30] the Covenant should be by seven
[2:37:34] [Applause]
[2:37:36] to keep the seed
[2:37:38] our life because these ones are under a
[2:37:42] covenant
[2:37:44] so it can't be by two
[2:37:47] but by seven
[2:37:49] [Music]
[2:37:54] keep the seed
[2:37:56] alive
[2:38:00] now in closing
[2:38:03] let me stop this in closing because
[2:38:05] anyhow we are closing weather in closing
[2:38:08] or not including but we are closing
[2:38:12] a rainbow Covenant
[2:38:16] for God to be your God
[2:38:19] who has to establish
[2:38:22] a covenant with you
[2:38:26] [Music]
[2:38:27] if you are not under his Covenant
[2:38:30] he is to you
[2:38:33] but if you are under a covenant
[2:38:41] that's the difference
[2:38:44] amen a man who just worshiped
[2:38:47] and the men who worship
[2:38:51] is two different things that's why he
[2:38:54] says he that is born
[2:38:57] no no not he that quit smoking but he
[2:39:02] that is
[2:39:04] because the the God he gets God
[2:39:11] you remember that better
[2:39:15] fighting against the prophet of God
[2:39:19] when I read the part
[2:39:22] that the sons of God
[2:39:30] the spirit from the other side
[2:39:33] he was opposing
[2:39:36] [Applause]
[2:39:38] these people talking about the
[2:39:41] underworld
[2:39:45] amen
[2:39:48] coming from PE from everyone
[2:39:53] and I'm going to read it
[2:39:57] now if somebody wants to fight he should
[2:40:00] fight the prophet
[2:40:02] [Applause]
[2:40:06] not me
[2:40:08] no I'm just a child
[2:40:11] and God has sent me
[2:40:15] Elijah the prophet
[2:40:17] [Applause]
[2:40:18] if you hear me saying underworld
[2:40:23] that's after my prophet
[2:40:27] underwater
[2:40:32] now if you wanna fight you'll fight him
[2:40:35] I'm coming with that we we're going to
[2:40:38] look into it
[2:40:44] chapter 8
[2:40:45] chapter 8 John more
[2:40:49] you are from beneath
[2:40:53] and I am from above
[2:40:55] foreign
[2:41:16] Mike
[2:41:18] brother
[2:41:20] I know that you are
[2:41:22] okay
[2:41:25] yeah
[2:41:26] I know that um
[2:41:33] so he says he did not he doesn't deny it
[2:41:37] uh
[2:41:38] I know that you are Abraham's seed
[2:41:42] and listen I know that yeah Abraham said
[2:41:46] but easy to kill me because my weight
[2:41:49] has no place in you
[2:41:50] [Music]
[2:41:52] the thing that that
[2:41:55] hate you have
[2:41:58] hatred in you it is because my way
[2:42:11] [Music]
[2:42:12] Come Away
[2:42:15] if the weight is not in you
[2:42:19] start you fight against the weight
[2:42:24] carry one brother
[2:42:27] I speak that which I have seen with my
[2:42:30] father and ye do that which he have seen
[2:42:32] with your father hey two fathers
[2:42:36] one is from his father
[2:42:38] and they are from their father
[2:42:42] okay
[2:42:44] they answered and said unto him Abraham
[2:42:47] is our father Jesus said unto them if
[2:42:50] you were Abraham's children you will do
[2:42:53] the works of Abram
[2:42:55] but now he's seek to kill me a man that
[2:42:58] have told you the truth which I have
[2:43:01] heard of God this did not Abraham he do
[2:43:05] the Deeds of your father then said they
[2:43:08] to him we be born we be not born of
[2:43:11] fornication we have one father even God
[2:43:15] Jesus said unto them if God were your
[2:43:18] father he will love me for I proceedeth
[2:43:23] forth and came from God neither came I
[2:43:27] of myself but he sent me
[2:43:31] I'm still looking for you came
[2:43:36] verse 23 yeah and he said unto them ye
[2:43:40] are from beneath I am from above right
[2:43:48] if I want to use
[2:43:51] another word for beneath
[2:43:57] I will say
[2:44:00] you are from
[2:44:06] even if I don't say underworld I can say
[2:44:09] you are from under
[2:44:12] um
[2:44:15] no Jesus
[2:44:17] says
[2:44:21] that's why we are at loggerheads
[2:44:26] are from
[2:44:29] under
[2:44:30] I am from
[2:44:36] now those from beneath and from
[2:44:39] above
[2:44:41] they don't share ideas
[2:44:45] they don't meet
[2:44:49] because the word of God is not coming
[2:44:52] from under it is from Benin
[2:44:56] it is from above
[2:44:58] that's the difference a person from
[2:45:02] beneath
[2:45:04] he will confront
[2:45:07] the one coming from
[2:45:11] above that's why he said
[2:45:14] I'm from my father you are from your
[2:45:18] father so two different fathers
[2:45:22] that's why we don't agree
[2:45:25] because I am from my father and you are
[2:45:29] from your father
[2:45:32] if
[2:45:35] yeah
[2:45:37] if you could list if they could listen
[2:45:39] to this
[2:45:46] Jesus from heaven
[2:45:50] he is God make flesh
[2:45:53] and dwelt Among Us
[2:45:57] to make friends with his seeds
[2:46:03] let me quickly run this
[2:46:08] area right and you finish now
[2:46:10] um
[2:46:11] I'm I'm reading nine you know read where
[2:46:15] I'm going okay
[2:46:21] and

[2:46:25] spoke unto Noah and to his sons
[2:46:29] with him say
[2:46:32] you know
[2:46:38] you know if if you are under a covenant
[2:46:44] you are blessed if your children are
[2:46:46] also under
[2:46:52] but it is in all in God's plan
[2:46:58] the parents go this way
[2:47:01] foreign

[2:47:29] underworld
