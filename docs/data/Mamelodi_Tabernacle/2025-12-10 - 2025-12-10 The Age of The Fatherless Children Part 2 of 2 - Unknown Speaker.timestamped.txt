[0:31] Okay.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; As we were trying to show that
[0:37] &gt;&gt; something here,
[0:38] &gt;&gt; but then let's read something because we
[0:41] I must
[0:45] close the service.
[0:49] There's a quote here.

[0:56] &gt;&gt; We've got to be the children of this
[0:58] age.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; We've got to be the children of this age
[1:06] through the pregnancy of the word of
[1:08] God.
[1:13] Amen. Amen. Uh while we are on here,
[1:19] you know, uh Paul says some something
[1:21] here
[1:24] &gt;&gt; to Timothy.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; I quote h second Timothy chapter one
[1:31] &gt;&gt; verse 8 verse 8 to his son. Be not thou
[1:36] therefore ashamed of the testimony of
[1:39] our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner, but
[1:44] be thou partaker of the afflictions of
[1:46] the gospel according to the power of
[1:48] God.
[2:00] Okay. Amen.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; Now he says the testimony of our Lord
[2:07] of me.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; That is Paul. Now listen again here.
[2:14] H it's a father
[2:16] to a a son.
[2:20] And uh as we will go back to to this uh
[2:24] scriptures here
[2:29] I have this part here to
[2:31] uh where are you just to share with you
[2:34] one one thing again here in the in the
[2:38] in the
[2:40] same book that's Timothy. Yes.
[2:44] Now he says
[2:46] &gt;&gt; um
[2:48] verse 13 verse 13 verse 14
[2:53] &gt;&gt; hold first the form of sound words which
[2:56] thou has heard of me
[3:04] hold fast the form of sound words
[3:08] sound gospel which thou has heard of me.
[3:19] Amen.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; You see,
[3:22] &gt;&gt; you have heard of me.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Me. Amen. Now, now he's a father.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; Talking to a son.
[3:33] Amen.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; Uh you have heard of me in faith and
[3:38] love which is in Christ Jesus.
[3:44] that good thing which was committed unto
[3:46] thee,
[3:50] you know, it was committed unto
[3:52] &gt;&gt; Timothy.
[3:55] Amen. As a father, he prayed for
[3:59] Timothy.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; And he committed things unto Timothy.
[4:07] Amen.
[4:09] Keep
[4:11] unto thee keep by the Holy Spirit
[4:18] &gt;&gt; who dwelleth in us.
[4:24] Hallelujah. Amen.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul says they went from us
[4:28] because they were not of us.
[4:32] Because the Holy Spirit dwelleth in
[4:36] us.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; Now, uh that is Paul to his son.
[4:46] And uh h again now I go back to this
[4:53] h e h uh because it says here
[4:57] &gt;&gt; for the time will come that is chapter 4
[5:01] now second Timothy
[5:04] verse three
[5:05] &gt;&gt; for the time will come
[5:08] when they will not endure a sound
[5:11] doctrine
[5:15] but after they own
[5:18] youthful lusts.
[5:22] Amen.
[5:24] &gt;&gt; Because if you come with a sound gospel
[5:30] to them, you are too old.
[5:36] Amen.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:38] uh you are not saving their lasts.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So because they've got some goals
[5:50] they want to achieve
[5:54] but they don't want a matured man
[6:01] to teach them
[6:04] because a matured man will take them
[6:07] higher
[6:11] and they don't want that position.
[6:14] They will want to remain as youth.
[6:23] So with their youthful last
[6:31] their mind,
[6:35] they look around the world.
[6:38] They want to be like that one
[6:41] and to be that one.
[6:44] If he's a singer,
[6:46] he wants to sing like that one.
[6:50] Amen. Amen.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; It's not to sing unto the Lord.
[6:54] Is to sing for fame
[6:57] to be seen of people.
[7:00] Amen. To be praised of men.
[7:03] That is the thing that led Elvis Press
[7:06] out of the church.
[7:09] and Michael Jackson all those they sold
[7:14] their souls
[7:19] for fame.
[7:24] They left their Pentecostal fathers
[7:29] and they became fatherless.
[7:33] Now a child without fatherh
[7:36] can can can sold can sell his soul.
[7:46] He has no responsible father.
[7:51] Amen. Amen.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; So they started in the church
[7:55] all of them
[7:58] singing in the church.
[8:00] Jesus keep me near the cross. Amen.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; And the Bible standing outside, the
[8:06] Satan standing outside say
[8:13] you'll get no fame in the church there.
[8:19] No money. You'll get no money there.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; No one will praise you there.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; The world won't see you.
[8:32] you can't entertain the world.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; So get out.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; And then
[8:42] Satan
[8:44] &gt;&gt; will equipped
[8:46] &gt;&gt; them
[8:47] with whatever.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; All right.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[8:58] what's up? WhatsApp
[9:04] &gt;&gt; Facebook
[9:11] &gt;&gt; instead of talking to the pastor, they
[9:13] are talking through the WhatsApp
[9:19] to the young to the other young.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; They need young pastors.
[9:29] Not only young but educated
[9:33] because they think
[9:36] they know better.
[9:42] Elijah was an old man.
[9:46] [applause and cheering]
[9:49] &gt;&gt; He had a son,
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Elisha.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; Elisha.

[10:01] &gt;&gt; in this man
[10:05] is not a master of
[10:08] &gt;&gt; he's not masters.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; He hasn't achieved masters.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; But in this man there is God.
[10:20] Amen.

[11:21] You know, she's well vested.
[11:26] She she know she she she knows
[11:29] &gt;&gt; the desires of the young people.
[11:33] Not that one.
[11:36] Hallelujah.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; An old man who's talking about holiness
[11:39] all the time. Holiness.
[11:45] Amen. Yeah. You should be holy.
[11:49] love one another
[11:51] and they got tired of that.
[11:56] So they want somebody will come and say
[12:00] uh you see with me
[12:04] I won't mind if a young man
[12:08] maybe um after the service
[12:12] he goes for the volleyball and
[12:18] you see a smart preacher
[12:24] &gt;&gt; like that one in where to saying
[12:27] you know I don't believe in God
[12:34] with um
[12:39] with
[12:40] some
[12:42] who will leave his children
[12:46] uh to be poor.
[12:50] Amen. I believe in a rich God
[12:53] and so forth. And the people were
[12:55] clapping, Amen.
[12:58] Amen. Those who with money and education
[13:01] were clapping hands
[13:04] and these others, the poor ones
[13:09] could not clap hands.
[13:16] Then that man he preaches with one hand
[13:19] in the pocket like this
[13:22] saying you see Jesus
[13:24] &gt;&gt; was a rich man
[13:28] and yet Jesus
[13:31] &gt;&gt; could not pay tax.
[13:35] Amen.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; He had no money to pay tax.
[13:40] He had to fish out a fish
[13:44] and fish out tax money out of that fish.
[13:49] [cheering]
[13:50] Amen.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus with an empty wallet.
[13:56] He was coming w with these people one
[13:59] time
[14:02] and he looked at a fig tree
[14:06] and a fig tree has failed to yield fig.
[14:11] The Bible says he was hungry.
[14:16] Amen.
[14:18] Amen.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; The son of God was hungry.
[14:23] Amen. Amen.

[14:43] looked he looked at the fig tree
[14:46] &gt;&gt; and uh without fig.
[14:49] So he cursed that tree
[14:52] because he was
[14:56] the hungry messiah.
[15:01] Amen.
[15:03] Amen.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; That was his humanity.
[15:08] He came to be a man,
[15:12] &gt;&gt; not a rich man,
[15:17] &gt;&gt; not an educated man,
[15:20] &gt;&gt; but the Messiah.

[15:55] a child of God you should be poor
[16:03] But you rather
[16:06] remain

[16:11] money
[16:13] but with God.

[16:39] &gt;&gt; like a small children

[18:04] now he doesn't take anything from the
[18:07] pastor.

[22:50] where he wish.
[22:55] So you can you can do that.
[23:00] You know, I always say to the people,

[23:08] worshiping God.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; Climbing up the leather.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; But the people that are down there, they
[23:22] don't want you to lift them up.
[23:26] They are looking at a mountain
[23:29] and they are going to hit that mountain
[23:32] because it's either you climbed or you
[23:35] hit it.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; It's only two things with a mountain.
[23:46] It's either you climb that mountain
[23:48] or you crash against it.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; The Bible says so. is either you believe
[23:56] Jesus Christ
[23:59] because he is the rock of ages.
[24:03] If you don't believe him, you you crash
[24:06] against the rock.
[24:11] I've seen churches studying
[24:14] around us
[24:17] and the people will will go there
[24:20] thinking that God has now come.
[24:26] The next thing
[24:28] &gt;&gt; it's on the rock
[24:31] &gt;&gt; they go to another one.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; It is like a people sailing.

[25:15] When the ship now is down,
[25:18] they start swimming to another sinking
[25:20] ship.
[25:24] Amen. Amen. Because
[25:27] &gt;&gt; uh they can't even think.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; You see now look what what he says then
[25:35] &gt;&gt; they will not endure
[25:38] sound
[25:41] that gives you life.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Something that puts Christ in you.
[25:50] Amen. Amen.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; So in everything you do,
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Christ becomes number one.

[26:08] &gt;&gt; for the time will come
[26:10] &gt;&gt; when they will not endure sound
[26:13] doctrine.
[26:15] But after their own lusts
[26:20] shall they heap to themselves
[26:24] because
[26:27] that pastor doesn't want girls and boys
[26:29] to run around
[26:32] go to that other one
[26:35] not to serve God
[26:38] &gt;&gt; but to serve the lasts.

[26:53] seal.

[27:00] &gt;&gt; I will lose.
[27:03] I must achieve.
[27:05] I must follow my dreams.

[27:17] &gt;&gt; The world shall pass away
[27:21] and all its lusts
[27:24] it shall pass away.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Let me finish this scripture
[27:31] and shall he to themselves teachers
[27:36] having itching ears.
[27:40] you know an itching ear
[27:47] I've seen at a stadium
[27:50] &gt;&gt; I don't know there was something there
[27:53] &gt;&gt; but they asked a gospel group to sing
[27:58] now the people that are there
[28:02] Jay-Z
[28:04] &gt;&gt; these are the Jay-Z people
[28:06] &gt;&gt; and what call them
[28:09] the kinds of music,
[28:12] &gt;&gt; what do you call it? Hip hop.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Hiphop
[28:15] &gt;&gt; and so forth.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see the way they are
[28:19] dressed up
[28:21] that they dressed up for hip-hop,
[28:25] &gt;&gt; not Jehovah.
[28:28] Dressed up for Jay-Z, not Jehovah.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Dress up for Lady Gaga.
[28:36] So I don't know what happened.
[28:40] A gospel group
[28:43] started to sing about Jesus.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; So they were looking at them like this
[28:52] and they were singing say Jesus is the
[28:54] Lord.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; They were just looking at them
[28:58] &gt;&gt; waiting for Jay-Z.
[29:04] Their ears are itching.
[29:07] Not not to hear about God,
[29:10] but to hear about Lady Gaga Beyonce.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; You say,
[29:18] &gt;&gt; "Okay."
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Let me
[29:22] show each ear
[29:26] &gt;&gt; not to hear the word of God.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; No.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; And they shall turn away their ears from
[29:33] the truth.
[29:38] Are you listening?
[29:41] &gt;&gt; They shall turn their ears from the
[29:43] &gt;&gt; truth.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Truth.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; And shall be turned unto fables.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Fables.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Thinking that maybe we should do this.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; A brother came to my house. Let me close
[30:05] this Bible now. A brother came to my
[30:08] house saying,
[30:10] "Brother,
[30:13] when are you going to call for the youth
[30:16] service or what?"
[30:19] I said my brother,
[30:23] &gt;&gt; brother Brennham,
[30:24] &gt;&gt; brother,
[30:24] &gt;&gt; he said one time,
[30:27] &gt;&gt; I used
[30:30] to talk to the young people.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; I used to do that.
[30:39] Then you can ask him and then what
[30:40] happened
[30:42] now when the seals were opened.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:49] which you can't take that to a youth
[30:51] camp
[30:57] &gt;&gt; because they are busy hiking,
[31:01] you know,
[31:02] &gt;&gt; and doing some things, you know, you
[31:05] can't take the the seals to a youth
[31:08] company.
[31:12] [cheering]
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where
[31:20] the people are taught that
[31:24] &gt;&gt; they bring a wise men there
[31:28] showing young people how to love one
[31:31] another.
[31:34] If if they are not taught of God,
[31:37] then they needed a teacher.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Because
[31:42] when when when I was created
[31:45] &gt;&gt; and you were created,
[31:47] God has put these things in you.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; When a child is born,
[31:57] &gt;&gt; do you teach him to suck?
[32:01] Do you teach the baby to suck?
[32:05] Immediately after the the baby's born
[32:10] and when she even can't see
[32:14] &gt;&gt; but already she wants milk
[32:18] because this thing is in the child.
[32:25] [cheering]
[32:26] &gt;&gt; You don't take the child to school in
[32:30] order for to suck from the mother's
[32:32] breast.
[32:35] saying you see milk is this it will do
[32:38] this in your body and death.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; No, it's already there.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Now love
[32:48] you can't teach love.
[32:52] [applause and cheering]
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Can you teach the people how to love one
[33:01] another?
[33:05] Hallelujah.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; I know you don't agree,
[33:09] &gt;&gt; but that thing if it is from God,
[33:13] &gt;&gt; it doesn't need somebody
[33:16] to teach you how to love
[33:22] because
[33:24] there isn't a gap love
[33:27] and feel your love.
[33:30] They are not from a university.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; They are from God.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; And then
[33:40] you love from the heart,
[33:44] &gt;&gt; not from the head.
[33:47] Amen. [applause]
[33:49] Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; People can waste time.
[34:00] Then they read many things.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; You know, you open the door for her.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; You see the first thing from job you
[34:11] keys and
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Then the people with some notes.
[34:21] Amen.
[34:23] But he's a what speaker?
[34:26] Am
[34:29] I wait what speaker?
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Motivational speaker.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Motivational speaker.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Is a man who comes you know
[34:39] saying
[34:41] and now uh as young people
[34:45] we need to achieve.
[34:50] We need to be vested and you know and so
[34:55] he will start those things
[34:58] &gt;&gt; after
[34:59] &gt;&gt; I've seen them after that
[35:03] &gt;&gt; and if divorce comes it comes
[35:09] &gt;&gt; God has taught us
[35:13] all whom the father has taught.
[35:18] That's why Jesus
[35:21] himself
[35:22] &gt;&gt; he always said
[35:25] my father
[35:27] &gt;&gt; my father
[35:29] [applause and cheering]
[35:31] &gt;&gt; because
[35:32] he can trace himself back.
[35:37] Amen.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; I have received of my father
[35:44] and that person can teach the others.
[35:48] because it is from
[35:52] Paul says, did you hear Paul speaking?
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want to hold you, but
[35:58] there's something here
[36:00] which
[36:02] is very important.
[36:05] Uh, okay. If let let me just quote it to
[36:09] you. Uh, where is it? Brother, brother
[36:12] uh Bruno.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Uh Timothy chapter 1. Second Timothy
[36:17] chapter 1A verse 3.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; I thank God whom I serve from my
[36:22] forefathers.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; You see?
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; From
[36:33] Amen.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Now a fatherless child
[36:38] &gt;&gt; uh has nothing to refer to.
[36:44] So he's just picking on things that are
[36:46] oncoming
[36:49] because uh he can't say my father taught
[36:52] me
[36:54] I have learned from my father I have
[36:57] received from my father no he's
[37:00] fatherless
[37:04] any person
[37:06] can do whatever he wants
[37:09] with him because he can't refer.
[37:14] He He's got no father.
[37:17] Hallelujah.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Fatherless child.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; He can't think. Somebody must think for
[37:25] him.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; A fatherless.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; All right.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:41] Okay.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Whom I serve from my
[37:46] and the Bible says
[37:47] &gt;&gt; he shall turn
[37:50] &gt;&gt; the hearts of the
[37:52] &gt;&gt; children
[37:53] back to their fathers.
[37:56] Amen. [cheering]
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says
[38:01] Cain could not trace himself.
[38:06] Amen.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:09] because his father was without the
[38:12] garden of Eden.
[38:18] But Abel could trace himself back
[38:24] because his father was in the garden of
[38:27] Eden.
[38:30] Amen.
[38:32] Now that's why Cain
[38:35] without any instructions,
[38:38] &gt;&gt; no commitments,
[38:41] he had a stick with him
[38:46] &gt;&gt; to hit anybody who would oppose him.
[38:51] Amen.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; If I'm saying I'm going that way, I'm
[38:56] going that way.
[38:59] No one is going to tell me what to do.
[39:03] No one is going to tell me how to
[39:04] worship.
[39:06] No one is going to tell me where to
[39:07] worship.
[39:09] I know what I'm doing.
[39:13] I have a dream to pursue.
[39:17] That was Cain.
[39:20] Then Adam came with seven seals.
[39:23] Cain hid him. [laughter]
[39:28] He he could not endure sound gospel.
[39:35] Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He just he wanted something
[39:39] tickling to his.
[39:44] He could only move
[39:47] when he could only move
[39:50] when it is according to the lustful the
[39:54] the useful lust.
[39:59] Amen.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; But thank God
[40:04] there is some young people
[40:09] Amen. [applause]
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Like Timothy,
[40:21] &gt;&gt; you won't get lost.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; As long as
[40:25] &gt;&gt; you have a father.
[40:28] [cheering and applause]
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:49] Amen.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[40:57] godliness.

[41:04] &gt;&gt; amen.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. They shall

[41:22] let let me finish this rather
[41:29] you don't know the scripture that says
[41:34] you've
[41:37] in the last days.
[41:42] But you know, a fable,
[41:45] &gt;&gt; a fable is something that sounds
[41:50] good,
[41:51] but has got no life.
[41:55] Amen. It's a fable
[41:58] as if God has done nothing.
[42:01] So they are studying a fresh.
[42:05] that we must do this, come together and
[42:08] do this and do this and do that. As if
[42:11] God has done nothing. And the prophet
[42:14] shouted and said, "It's all over.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; The seals are open. It's all over."
[42:24] Amen.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let him that is filthy be filthy
[42:27] still.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let him that is righteous be
[42:33] righteous still
[42:36] because the book was open. [screaming]
[42:40] The names were called and it's all over.
[42:46] Amen.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; And the people of the age
[42:50] are starting a fresh as if God has done
[42:53] nothing
[42:57] and they think they going the right
[42:58] direction.
[43:01] with some endless meetings and
[43:05] gossips,
[43:08] Facebooks and Facebook,
[43:10] &gt;&gt; why can't you talk?
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Why you use Facebook?
[43:17] If you're of talking to your brother,
[43:20] you take Facebook,
[43:22] &gt;&gt; why why can't you talk to your brother?
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is that time they use
[43:29] technology
[43:31] and the devil is picking them one by one
[43:33] from that.

[44:17] &gt;&gt; proud,
[44:19] &gt;&gt; lasers,

[44:24] to parents.
[44:27] Here they are
[44:29] disobedient.
[44:32] Amen. Amen.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; They rather hear their friends
[44:38] or the new trends.
[44:42] because they've got nothing to refer to.
[44:47] Amen. Amen. Unthankful.
[44:50] They can't even thank God that
[44:54] you have saved us. You have kept us.
[44:58] They the Bible says they always follow
[45:01] some new things.
[45:04] They don't have a thing to revert to.
[45:08] Okay. Amen.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Without natural affection,
[45:14] &gt;&gt; truth breakers, false accusers,
[45:17] incontinent, fierce, despisers of those
[45:21] that are good,
[45:24] &gt;&gt; traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of
[45:27] pleasure more than lovers of God,
[45:32] having a form of godliness
[45:36] but denying the power
[45:40] from such
[45:42] &gt;&gt; turn away.

[46:04] &gt;&gt; Paul says,
[46:06] &gt;&gt; he said to the church,
[46:08] I am I begot you.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; So young men, you are blessed.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; If you are not led
[46:19] by some other young men,
[46:23] [applause]
[46:25] but you have a father
[46:28] to refer to
[46:31] like Jesus. God bless you as we stand
[46:34] up.
[46:36] All right.
