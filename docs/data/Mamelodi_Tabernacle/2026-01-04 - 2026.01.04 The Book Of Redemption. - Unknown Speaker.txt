But father, there was a time when somebody sent his men to go and find out from Bel Zebab, [music] the king of the demons. That did not please you, Lord.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you all. It's been a wonderful time to be here. This is my third my third time here. I I'm very thankful. I'm always treated so royally every day. Thank you for that. I woke up this morning. I was thinking about uh God will double his word uh in uh the book of Genesis. I believe it's Genesis chapter 41. &gt;&gt; When Joseph interpreted Pharaoh's dream, he said that both of those things, the cattle and the wheat, &gt;&gt; were both the same thing. The dream was being said with different examples, but it was the same dream. &gt;&gt; And he said that the reason for that is because God was confirming his word by doubling it. So to me that is basically like saying yay and amen. Amen. And uh as I said the other day and I'll format it again this morning because because life is like a vapor and we know not what will be on the tomorrow. I will say if I have an invitation and if the Lord is willing to turn back again to see you. God bless you. Thank you very [applause] much. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One more time, can we give him a round of applause? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we are going to a very crucial time. The time of the word of the Lord. Are we all ready for the word? As we stand up on our feet to welcome our deacon, brother &gt;&gt; for the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But in the days of the voice of the shadow [music] begin to sound that [music and singing] God [music] should be finished as he has declared to his [music] proh. Oh, [music] and I [music and singing] shall the prophet [music] and he shall [music] their heart [singing] Fathers to their children [music] of the children to the [music] blessing. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Well, [music] well, [music] holy ghost. [music] [singing] Father, [music] host. [music] [applause] Amen. Amen. Shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; And God bless you. &gt;&gt; We are just going to go straight into the word. There's a song. The day of redemption is if we can just sing a stanza before we read the word. stands up in May the Lord richly bless you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Nations are breaking. Israel awaking the [music] signs that the prophets were told [music] [singing] with horset [music] [singing] will unfold. Oh, [music and singing] the day of redemption is here. [music] and [singing] heart of beautiful be [music] with sp [singing] [music] [singing] your redemption is there. Oh, [music and singing] that day of redemption is here and [music and singing] are fading for [music and singing] the spirit. Your hands redempt. You come [music and singing] your redemption is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we ask our elder Elder Reed to say a word of prayer, &gt;&gt; then after we will read the scriptures. God bless you. Thank you, dear Lord, as we come before you, dear God, that you'll speak to our hearts, dear Lord, and anoint [music] brother Matheisa here as he speaks. We commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us turn to Revelation 3 verse 5. and Revelation 13 verse 8. Revelation 13:8, Revelation 3:5. He that overcomemeth, the same shall be clothed in white remnant, &gt;&gt; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation 13. &gt;&gt; Chapter 13, verse 8. and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. And the last scripture will be Revelation 5 verse 1 and verse 7. Revelation 5 verse 1 and 7. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. Verse seven. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. God bless you. &gt;&gt; You may take your seat. I'm going to title this message &gt;&gt; the book of redemption and the subtitle or text the book of life and the Lamb's Book of Life. I'm going to take my time just to give the introduction. We have the book of redemption. When we read Revelation chapter 5, it talks about a book. But then when we read other scriptures, it talks about two books. Now I'm going to read from the spoken word communion. communion. &gt;&gt; Um, my message was inspired from one of the messages that the pastor preached being identified &gt;&gt; with Christ. And in those slides that the pastor shared with us, the pastor touched on the lamb's book of life and the book of life. Now the prophet says here, &gt;&gt; the two books being one, &gt;&gt; the book of life. So the prophet says &gt;&gt; the Baptist &gt;&gt; believe there's two separate books and in one way it is two separate books another way it is not two separate books. So the two books the prophet says &gt;&gt; being one. &gt;&gt; So the first book is the book of life. &gt;&gt; Then there is the lamb's book of life. Now the prophet says is one book. So that's what I want to share with you today. It says these two books are very mysterious. Says there you are two books. One of them is the lamb's book of life and the other one is the book of life. And he says the first book of life was when you were born. &gt;&gt; That was your natural birth. So not everybody is recorded in the book of life. But the prophet says and the Bible says your name was written in the book of life before the foundation. And it says again your name was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation. But it comes back again and say the first book of life was when you were born. &gt;&gt; That was your natural birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the prophet says on the invisible union of the bride of Christ says in the book of life. one says, &gt;&gt; you can put your name on and again your name can be taken out of the book of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you read another book, the prophet says works is faith expressed says the two books of life is the same book meaning the book of life and the lamb's book of life is one book but one of them is your natural birth. The other one is your spiritual birth. One leads out to the other one. Meaning you are transferred from one book to the other book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is your two books. &gt;&gt; One of them is the lamb's book of life. Your name on there is predestinated. It can go. Yes, &gt;&gt; it was for ordained to be in there. &gt;&gt; But the regular book of life, your name can be taken off. &gt;&gt; If you don't repent, &gt;&gt; it's taken off. Now the prophet also says &gt;&gt; you are transferred from the book of life to the lamb's book of life and we will look at it before we close where the prophet talks about mediatorial work prophet and redemption your name when God is well pleased. Remember we talked about the placing of the son. Now the Holy Ghost is your tutor. Now the truth brings the word &gt;&gt; to the almighty God, &gt;&gt; the father and and report [snorts] you and if the father is pleased with the report then you are adopted. You see The Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; is a teacher. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; is a tutor. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost put you positionally. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says it brings the word &gt;&gt; to the father. Amen. And and if the father is pleased with the report, then you are transferred from the book of life into the lamb's book of life. Let me read this. The prophet says, "You separated from your first union. by spiritual death. That means your first union is when you were born, your natural birth brings you into the book of life. That is your first union. Then by spiritual death, you know Paul said it is not me that deliver. You see that is what we call spiritual. Meaning now you are born. You are remarried again to the new spiritual union. Not of your natural life. but of eternal life. That gem that was in you at the beginning found you. So that's why now the old book is gone which is your old union. Now you are transferred into the new book not the book of life. But the lamb's book what the lamb redeemed you see the lamp during the mediatorial work was standing in for you to be transferred. Then once all are transferred The prophet says, "Now the lamb redeem what? Those that are in the lamb's book of life. Let me read it again. Your name is now in the new book. Not the book of life, &gt;&gt; but the lamb's book of life. That is what the lamb came to redeem. You see, redemption is not for those that are in the book of life. It's for those that are in the lamb's life. That's what he came to. Your new life is in the lamb's book of life. Your marriage certificate. You know, pastor talk the Lord about the marriage certificate. And I must confess I didn't know what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; It was just cremework to say the revelation of the seven se is the marriage certificate. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know how many times he said that, &gt;&gt; but now when we see it, &gt;&gt; you know, I really appreciate the believers, &gt;&gt; they take the clips of the pastor and they post them. And when you listen to them, you get blessed &gt;&gt; because sometimes we sit in the service &gt;&gt; and we shout, "Amen, hallelujah, amen, hallelujah. But some of the things they just pass through our head. But when you sit and listen to the teachings of pastor, it is a blessing. Amen. [applause] So this church was truly blessed. Now your new life is in the lamb's book of life. your marriage certificate. Now, we know the book of life and we know the lamb's book of life. Now, the book of life, they come in the second resurrection. So, it's not safe there. So, if you remain in the book of life, you are coming up in the second resurrection. But those that are in the lamb's book, they come in the first result, those are the people that are going in the rapture. Those that are in the lamb's book, but those that are in the book of life, the prophet says you can be blotted out. Let let's just look at it. &gt;&gt; It says first of all let us review our cases. Now this is in the church age book ages says we know most assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election. It was purposed in himself. It was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself, a word bride. You see, this was chosen before the foundation. She was fornown and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages. [snorts] She was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation. She can never be in the judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her. Amen. You see, those are those in the section of the lamb's book of life. They were chosen before the foundation of secondly there's another class. Their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second resurrection. So it is not safe to be in the book of life because you come up in the second resurrection. Such are the foolish visions and the righteous as are spoken of in Matthew 25. You see, when you read the book of Matthew 25, talks about the 10 visions, those that have oil and there are those that do not have oil in their lives. And the Bible says they both slept. I believe they both went under the old and we look at it. Now this class you have those that had oil, [clears throat] you have those that do not have oil. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when a shout came &gt;&gt; to say the bridegroom cometh, &gt;&gt; those that had oil went to the marriage supper. But those foolish visions, they went to buy oil. Coming back, the Lord said, "I don't know you. But they are from the book of life. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "I don't know." &gt;&gt; The Bible says, &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 20, Revelation, &gt;&gt; they come up. &gt;&gt; They come up in the second resurrection. They receive their eternal life in the judgment. &gt;&gt; That is the second class. Now before we leave this, &gt;&gt; there is a portion that I want to talk about. There are those that are under the altar. Crying, how long, how long, oh Lord? Now that is not the bride. Those are the Jews. They cry after the rapture. &gt;&gt; When the bride leaves the sixth dimension going for the marriage supper, these Jews, they start crying. How long? How long? Now they are not crying. They start crying. When the bride leaves the sixth dimension dimension &gt;&gt; that is in the rapture when the bride is going for the marriage supper. Now the prophet says they start crying &gt;&gt; to say how long how long oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Now the Bible says &gt;&gt; the Lord said wait until your fellow brethrens has been mired as you are. Now these Jews are those that died for the testimony which they held and they were standing for the word of God. They did not die for the testimony of Jesus. They rejected the Messiah. So they know nothing about themselves but because they were blinded for our sake God give them eternal life. Hitler man killed them. They went under the old of the Matias. Now they come up &gt;&gt; in the second resurrection. &gt;&gt; So they are not going to see the millennia. That's what the prophet says is the 144,000 &gt;&gt; 144,000 &gt;&gt; that is mati for the testimony of Jesus. The Lord left the marriage supper to &gt;&gt; introduce himself to the 144,000 144,000. &gt;&gt; That's why my pastor said they are going to be serving the bride in the millennium as the uns. You know if you were taught under pastor Israel you come from a high university [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; truly if you were under the ministry of pastor Israel you are blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the 144,000 &gt;&gt; 144,000 &gt;&gt; they are in the millennium &gt;&gt; but this ones that were killed by Hitler and Stalin they cry how long how long and the prophet says they come in the second. So for 1,000 years they are waiting under the oil waiting for the second resurrection. Now let's go to the third class because the first class is the bride in the lamb's book of life. The second class are those that are in the book of life. The prophet give an example about the foolish vision. They come up in the second resurrection. We are in the book of life. Now the prophet says there are those now this is another class the third class. This are the borderline Christians. And he give an example about those Israelite coming out of Egypt. This failed to obey God, but they are in the book of life, but they failed to obey and being void of the spirit. Though even the signs and wonders were amongst them will have their names removed from the book of life. Can the brother show us that diagram? You see my brother I don't know how to use this. Oh, just bear with me. &gt;&gt; You see, this is the book of life. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says those that overcome, &gt;&gt; they are transferred into the lamb's book of life. That's why during the seven church age saying he that overcome he that overcome even those that received the white stone are the overcomers. So in the book of life, no white stone. &gt;&gt; The overcomers, the one that received the white stone are the one that are transferred in the lamb's book of life. Now we have those unfortunately my arrow moved out here. You remember Judas, the one that betrayed the Lord Jesus Christ. The prophet says he was in the book of life, but he was blotted out. And the prophet says it was better if he was not even born. You see, the natural birth brought him into the book of life. But he was blotted off. So the prophet says that is the third class the natural birth brings them into the book of life but because they failed to repent they are blotted out. In another spoken word he says these are the people that grieved the Holy Ghost. They were blotted out. &gt;&gt; We'll come back to them. &gt;&gt; There's the fourth class. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This natural birth &gt;&gt; didn't even bring them into the book of life. The prophet says they were recorded somewhere. &gt;&gt; Let's read Revelation 17:8. You know when the pastor read this scripture I thought you know sometimes you read the scripture you don't see anything then the pastor come and read the scripture and you think he just wrote that scripture but the scripture has been there revelation 17 my brother verse eight [clears throat] &gt;&gt; the beast that thou sawest was and is the beast that thou seest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into petition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names &gt;&gt; uh stop there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see when he start by saying the beast and thou h so was and is not you know say hey now these things are getting difficult. But as you continue it says whose names were not written in the book of life. So meaning they were born but they were not recorded in the book of life. And the prophet says that is the fourth class. And he give an example. He says Pharaoh Pharaoh was never in the book of life. He was born recorded somewhere. And the prophet says these ones that were not even in the book of life straight to the lake of fire. You see with Judas he says it was better he was not he was blotted out he's going to the lake of fire this ones like Pharaoh the prophet says they were never even in the book of life straight to the lake and Balam was on the third class. &gt;&gt; He was blotted out &gt;&gt; from the book of life. Now it says those whose names are not written in the book of life of the lambs slain from the foundation of the world they will come in the second resurrection if they were in the book of life but those that were brought out or those that were not even in the book of life straight to the lake of Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe now we understand the book of life and the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now let's read something here in the lamb's book of life. Spoken word lamb's book of life. Uh page 18. &gt;&gt; Page 18. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 135. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 135. He says, &gt;&gt; let's start from paragraph 134. Paragraph 134. &gt;&gt; And he deceived all except those whose names were written in the lamb's book of life. He deceived all the whole earth, the religious cult. He de he deceived all with his great propaganda. We are all one big church and we out to all unite together and have the things of the world. And the prophet says thousands of mothers, millions of them will say, "That's the thing we want. Watch where it comes from." Sister, watch where the background of it is. And he deceived all whose names were written in the lamb's book. He deceived all whose names are not written in the lamb's book of life. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet says. Those that are not in the book of life, in the lamb's book of life, they can be deceived. But those that are in the book of life, in the lamb's book of life, they cannot be deceived. Now, let's go back, my brother. Read Ephesians chapter 1 verse4. Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4. according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. &gt;&gt; You see the prophet says &gt;&gt; he wrote our names in the lamb's book of life before the foundation. Amen. Now you see the names were written in the lamb's book of life. Now that's why he says he chose us in him. You see now he was before the foundation he said he he he wrote the names. Now the prophet says, &gt;&gt; uh, I just want to to to to to read this Let me just go back to the book of seals uh 103 &gt;&gt; uh book of seals page 103. &gt;&gt; The Bible says &gt;&gt; he chose us &gt;&gt; in him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when he was writing &gt;&gt; our names in the lamb's book of life. Now when the time of redemption came, he took the book within himself because he chose us in him. You see the book of redemption. He chose us in him. Then when the redemption come he took the book in him that was the last book of faith now the portion that I wanted to read it says that's the way we were we are here we come from a higher being before the foundation In the beginning we were in the image of God. You see the prophet says when God said let us make man in our own he was writing our names before the foundation. And he says the veil and the darkness keeps us from knowing it. And somewhere the prophet says you were there in the attributes but you don't remember &gt;&gt; because you are just a part of his life. So when he was writing our names the prophet says and that's the portion I want to read. He says here in the beginning &gt;&gt; that's okay let me start here now that's where we were in the beginning you do not understand it now but you was back there in the beginning when God made man in his image he made him a theophile You see when he chose us in him he made us. &gt;&gt; So when we are looking at the lamb's book of life when he came to redeem he was redeeming the people that he chose in you. That's true. &gt;&gt; Let's uh look at this. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, &gt;&gt; you know, the prophet went beyond the curtain of time. Then he says, "Now with the lamp, with the book in his hands, That is page 103 uh the bridge between seven church ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 252. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 252. &gt;&gt; He says we are ready to ask his grace and mercy upon us to open the seven seal book to us and let us look past the curtain of time. Amen. &gt;&gt; [crying] &gt;&gt; Notice when he took the book the title did and he broke the seals of the mystery to bring to reveal them to bring them to his see all of his redeemed subjects. So it says redemption &gt;&gt; is only for his subject that are written in the lamb's book of life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So redemption is not for all. When you talk about the book of redemption, He's redeeming those that he wrote in the lamb's book of Christ before the foundation. &gt;&gt; He says, "But now he comes from here at this last seed. He is no more a mediator. You see, he was a mediator &gt;&gt; when he stood to bring the people back into the lens book of those that overcome when he is done with that meritorial work he is king. You see the last message that the pastor preached pastor David &gt;&gt; he brought this &gt;&gt; that after the meritorial work when he now comes to collect his subject he comes as a king to collect the queen. He is king now. And what does he do if he is a king? He has to have subjects. And his subject is them that he has redeemed. So those that he redeemed from the lamb's book of life. He is a king to them &gt;&gt; and they cannot come before him until he takes the right of redemption. He come to get his subject. Now to get his subject he revealed his secrets and the subject saw it. You see that's why we have two classes of people those that don't get the revelation &gt;&gt; and those that get the revelation you see Peter the Lord Jesus said blessed are thou for it is my father that revealed this to me because he is in the lamb's book of life the father reveal his secret and he says upon this revelation of who Jesus Christ I will build my church and that rock is the revelation of who he is that's why he says those that overcome I will give them the white stone So the white stone, it's not for all those that overcome. &gt;&gt; Can you read that scripture, my brother? &gt;&gt; You found it. &gt;&gt; Revelation 2 verse 17. &gt;&gt; He that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcomemeth will I give to it of the hidden manner and will give him a white stone. &gt;&gt; You see? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Him that overcometh. &gt;&gt; So that means the one that is transferred to the book of life of life that's the one that received the white stone. But the one that remains in the book of life no white stone. That one the prophet says &gt;&gt; that one do not understand the secret of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says he revealed his secret and they saw it. &gt;&gt; So only the people from the lamb's book of life see this secret. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when when he stood up, &gt;&gt; there's this part that the pastor read to us and it was a beautiful part. You see, he says, listen what a jubilee going on. When they seen that lamp and take that book of redemption, their souls screamed out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a portion I think I I missed. &gt;&gt; Let me just go back to my notes. It says page 99 here. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let me just move on. The time is not on my side. You see when when John &gt;&gt; let's go to Revelation chapter 5 in closing verse four my brother &gt;&gt; Revelation 5:4 and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on. &gt;&gt; It was so painful for John. &gt;&gt; He cried because he says there was no man worthy &gt;&gt; found worthy open to read to look there. That's why the prophet says those that are in the lamb's book of life when the book is opened they saw it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now Jo wept when the book was closed and it said there was no man to open the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. But then as we move on, &gt;&gt; verse seven, my brother, &gt;&gt; verse seven, and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says, &gt;&gt; he is the one that wrote our names in the lamb's book of so he knew what was in the lamb's book of. So that's why he came forth. There was no other person that knew what was written in the lamp. The lamp knew. That's why it say he took the book within his then John the prophet says saw his name wrote there and he looked there in the prophet said he must have saw his name wrote there when the sins are broke you must see your name written. Then he says here talk about the jubilee talk about the time when the lamb walked forth. You see the book is even sealed in heaven. Now the mysteries are is my name there. You see when you go home ask yourself is my name in the book of life or in the lamb's book. So the mysteries are my name in the lamb's book. But if it is it was put on the book before the foundation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me close with this. You see the prophet says &gt;&gt; John has been standing there our brother crying everything in heaven everything in the earth everything in the sea had me holler Before he saw his name in the he was crying. But when the seals were broke, John must have looked in and seen past the curtain of Christ and said, "There is John." You see the prophet &gt;&gt; his body was lying there &gt;&gt; with a bald head. But when he went past the curtain of no bald head, [applause] &gt;&gt; he even said, &gt;&gt; "I will encourage you to keep your hair." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the prophet went beyond the curtain of time because the prophet says &gt;&gt; he was worried when you read the the book I'm just going to close with this. He says I was afraid to die because I didn't know what I will become. I know I was not lost but I knew I I didn't know whether I will become a spirit or a ghost and I will meet brother Negize him as a as a cloud man but he says when he went beyond the c of it helped him a lot now he was no longer afraid to die because beyond the he realized he is. Amen. Now the the mystery is my name. There he says talk about the hepit. You see we we must talk about the height. The height. When we were sitting here and the pastor was you see unveiling to us that we are in the lamb's book that WAS A HAPPY TIME everything in heaven. He must have re really cried out everything in heaven everything in the earth beneath the earth. every creation me say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessings &gt;&gt; and glory and wisdom and power and might belongs to him. Why will John say that the prophet says he must have seen another? You see when when the secret were revealed, you see because the prophet says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of." You see, the day of redemption is when the secret is revealed and you will see the prophet says, "The day of redemption is when the book was open. And when the book was opened, John who did not grieve the Holy Spirit saw beyond the seal signifies a complete way. So you are sealed until the day of death. So while you are in the book of life, you are sealed. But if you grieve the Holy Spirit, you are blotted out. So you are sealed until the day of redemption. So when the the book of redemption is open just like John, you see beyond the you see your name of you know you are redeemed bless you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Let us just say again my brother [applause] the day of redemption &gt;&gt; then we will askinde to come forth. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Amen and amen. [applause] Acts [music] chapter 2 from verse 36-39. Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.

Our sister took a step to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray for her Lord God Almighty that you give her the new heart and the new spirit so that she can overcome the devil in all his tricks. Let our sister believe the word not the propaganda of the devil. We pray for her Lord God Almighty that you give her strength, courage and wisdom. When the Israelite left Egypt, it was not an easy journey. But the presence of the prophet Moses &gt;&gt; provided for them everything that they needed. We are under the ministry of the prophet William Brenham. Not only that, but we are also under the ministry that the Lord God Almighty gave to Pastor Israel. That should be enough for our sister to cross over into the promised land. We pray for her, Lord God Almighty. We pray for our elders. We pray for the church. We pray for our brothers that performed the baptism. It's not an easy thing to be a Baptist. But we are so glad Lord God Almighty that without tiring our brothers are always performing these duties. Give them strength. Give them courage. Most importantly Lord reveal the word unto us. Our elder will be departing going to the USA. Father, we just want to remember him in prayer. &gt;&gt; Bless him Lord. Give him strength, courage, and wisdom. We are still in great expectation that you will provide grace for him to return. We commit everything unto your hand. In the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you so much, Bazalan. I just want to respect the sister who has been baptized because we thought we don't have a baptism, but God said no, she cannot be left behind. So, we just want to thank the Lord that God has done something to her. Amen. We are going to ask our brother just for two. We are going just to ask one song from our brother and then the church will be dismissed. Amen. God bless you all. Amen.
