[15:40] Fore
[16:00] on behalf of the family
[16:04] um
[16:06] we would like to thank Thank you for
[16:10] taking uh the time
[16:13] uh to be with us today as we celebrate
[16:19] uh the life of
[16:22] Elas Moro Mul.
[16:26] Um it occurs to me as I'm standing here
[16:28] now that
[16:30] a couple of months ago or six to be
[16:34] precise
[16:36] uh was the last time I stood in front of
[16:38] family and friends to speak. Uh it was
[16:44] a
[16:46] sunny spring day and uh the occasion was
[16:51] quite joyous.
[16:54] I stand here before you today on a cold
[16:59] winter day and uh the occasion is not so
[17:03] joyous.
[17:04] Such is life I guess.
[17:08] [Music]
[17:10] Um we are overwhelmed and uh extremely
[17:16] grateful for the outpouring love and
[17:21] support
[17:23] uh that you have shown over the years
[17:27] and uh you continue
[17:30] uh to do uh up to up to this day.
[17:36] Uh
[17:39] the deceased
[17:43] was my father
[17:46] uh but was to his peers
[17:51] uh boy.
[17:54] Uh that nickname uh in those days
[17:58] carried with it another nickname uh
[18:02] which is Biza.
[18:04] He was boy to his peers. He was
[18:10] malume boy to some of you and he was
[18:16] also braza
[18:18] uh to most of you.
[18:22] He was one of six siblings.
[18:27] Uh fifth born
[18:30] uh one of two sons uh the rest uh uh
[18:36] being ladies, women.
[18:40] [Music]
[18:43] I would like to share with you. I know
[18:46] my some of our speakers will will come
[18:49] and speak at length about the attributes
[18:53] of of the men. Uh on my part I would
[18:57] like to share
[18:59] uh first I think a formative lesson that
[19:02] I learned from the men. Uh I think
[19:06] secondly will be an accomplishment that
[19:09] I thought we shared together.
[19:12] Uh thirdly uh is a regret that I have
[19:17] uh and there's a lighter part uh as as
[19:21] the fourth part
[19:24] um
[19:26] as a lesson uh that was metered out to
[19:29] me in my formative years.
[19:32] Um
[19:34] time came when like most of us I had to
[19:39] go fend for myself and and work after
[19:45] uh
[19:47] acquitting myself
[19:49] uh with school.
[19:52] Um
[19:57] at the time I was I was cashless. I
[20:01] needed funds
[20:03] for Galia, suits, ties, and all. Of
[20:07] course, money for transport. And I knew
[20:10] I had a dad. And I walked up to him and
[20:12] I said, "Uh, can you help him out? Can
[20:15] you help me out, Dad?" He said, "Of
[20:17] course I will." Uh, the money was
[20:21] provided, but he made it very clear that
[20:24] that money was repayable,
[20:26] so it was a loan.
[20:30] And I thought what kind of a father is
[20:32] this? I mean, you know, I thought he
[20:34] would be supportive throughout.
[20:37] I started work um
[20:41] in a few months as we had foreseen.
[20:45] Um it became apparent that I would have
[20:48] to acquire a vehicle which I needed as a
[20:51] tool of training to be able to progress
[20:55] with my uh my profession.
[21:00] Uh I thought I had repaid uh the first
[21:05] lumpsum
[21:07] you let me go and ask again hopefully
[21:10] this time I'll get away with it. So I
[21:13] approach him again. I say I need help. I
[21:16] don't have a great record. Can you help
[21:20] source funding for me and we'll see how
[21:23] it goes. He said no no banks. I will
[21:26] give it to you. But once more it is
[21:29] repayable.
[21:32] And so the money was advanced and I
[21:34] worked and I paid it back.
[21:37] On the third occasion when I thought I
[21:41] had arrived, I needed more space.
[21:44] I had to move away from home. I
[21:46] approached him again. On this occasion,
[21:49] I was not asking for money. He was just
[21:51] giving notice that
[21:53] I was about to take exams. traveling
[21:56] from Joker to David took a lot of my
[21:59] time. I wanted to move closer to
[22:02] work which was in Park Town then. So I
[22:05] needed a small space somewhere and he
[22:07] said you've got my blessings you can go
[22:11] and I said thank you and he said you
[22:13] forgot something. I said what? He said
[22:15] you need money again. I said no not this
[22:18] time I I'm okay.
[22:21] and and the next day he handed me a cash
[22:25] and he said this time it is a gift.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; And the lesson learned there I guess was
[22:32] to teach me to respect the value of
[22:34] money because I would have worked for it
[22:38] so that if I have it as a gift I treat
[22:41] it as well as the one that I would have
[22:44] earned.
[22:47] Um that was the lesson.
[22:51] Uh I see viewers laughing there. He owes
[22:53] me that one.
[22:58] Um the second uh that being the lesson,
[23:02] the second is an accomplishment that I
[23:05] thought we shared uh equally together.
[23:08] Uh there came a time in my life when I
[23:11] became curious about who my ancestors
[23:13] were. asked a lot of questions
[23:16] and he indicated that
[23:20] my whilst I knew where my grandfather
[23:23] lay uh the search was for the great
[23:27] grandfather and anything higher if we
[23:30] could find.
[23:32] Um he recalled taking a trip to
[23:36] Guazulunatal where
[23:39] uh they buried the our my
[23:42] greatgrandfather his grandfather and he
[23:45] expressed a longstanding wish uh to
[23:50] visit that place at the same time that I
[23:52] was curious.
[23:54] um
[23:56] together with family at some point we
[23:59] organized a road trip during vacations.
[24:03] But what we included in there
[24:06] was a stop
[24:08] uh at the place where we sought to track
[24:12] and trace the burial place of uh my
[24:15] great uh grandfather.
[24:18] Um, and we succeeded
[24:22] uh
[24:23] because we took a trip to a small town
[24:29] called Thornville uh between Peter
[24:32] Marisburg and Richmond
[24:35] uh Escortism Kizer where we found the
[24:39] remains of my greatgrandfather
[24:42] uh intact. In case you're wondering how
[24:46] he ended there,
[24:48] um he
[24:50] was from here but uh after the
[24:54] uh departure of um her first wife, he
[24:58] remarried
[24:59] uh uh
[25:02] uh lady from uh Escort Kis and and lived
[25:07] there for the rest of his life.
[25:10] Um that was an accomplishment that I
[25:12] thought we shared. uh uh together uh
[25:16] during that holiday. He he spoke about
[25:18] it a couple of times
[25:20] uh expressing satisfaction about the
[25:23] discovery.
[25:25] A regret that I have
[25:28] um is that well one step back. So my
[25:34] maternal grandmother
[25:36] and my paternal grandmother
[25:39] are both scoras.
[25:43] [Music]
[25:45] I have had occasions where I was invited
[25:49] by Kosanas
[25:51] which I would have thought were the one
[25:53] part and didn't expect the other part
[25:57] yet the other part turned up and it
[26:01] occurred to me as I became wiser that
[26:05] these families are are related
[26:08] but what I asked questions about and
[26:11] have not been able to establish
[26:14] is to trace back the common ancestor
[26:18] further back
[26:20] and I imagine
[26:23] my father could not provide the answers.
[26:26] We spoke about it a couple of times. He
[26:27] was keen. He meant to make arrangements
[26:30] with those who could know but we never
[26:33] managed to to resolve that uh query in
[26:38] my head. So a challenge to the scorers
[26:41] in the house. I need to know how is it
[26:45] that both my grandmothers are scorers.
[26:49] We will take this out. We'll take this
[26:52] offline.
[26:55] Lastly, as I said on the lighter side,
[26:57] um
[26:59] uh I I acquired my love for jazz uh
[27:02] because he was a big jazz fan. Uh the
[27:05] music would bellow in the house. uh on
[27:10] weekends and at the time I used to think
[27:13] uh this was madness. Little did I
[27:16] realize that he would leave uh with me a
[27:21] legacy that I have recourse to
[27:25] um when I need to relax and I thank him
[27:29] for that.
[27:30] [Music]
[27:32] Uh in conclusion, um
[27:38] I would like to
[27:40] [Music]
[27:42] express uh sincere gratitude to all of
[27:46] those who uh were supportive uh
[27:51] particularly after
[27:53] uh we lost our mother. Um
[27:58] [Music]
[28:01] I intend to single out the few people
[28:03] and in so doing please I do not exclude
[28:08] um
[28:10] those of you who who who were supportive
[28:13] and I think firstly uh I must thank my
[28:16] wife
[28:18] uh he
[28:20] he was very appreciative of your
[28:22] support. He uh Baba
[28:26] expressed his gratitude to me for the
[28:29] support that Ti gave her throughout the
[28:33] years. Of course, he gave her a nickname
[28:36] and he apparently used to call her Sui
[28:39] because she was nagging her with care
[28:43] and attention etc. But he expressly
[28:47] acknowledged uh in the last couple of
[28:51] months when I was driving home with him
[28:54] uh the support that you have provided.
[28:57] Uh Sara uh thank you very much. Baba
[29:01] spent the last 3 years or so of his life
[29:05] with Sara who who was taking care of him
[29:09] and he seemed uh at peace in in Sah's
[29:14] presence. Thank you very much.
[29:18] Lastly, I don't know if he's here. They
[29:21] call him Gadza in the neighborhood. He's
[29:24] the neighborhood doctor. His name is
[29:26] Masasi Gatani. Uh I would like to
[29:30] express uh my sincere thanks and
[29:32] gratitude
[29:34] uh for the endless house calls that he
[29:38] rendered the urgent scripts that could
[29:41] ask
[29:42] uh at all times. Uh he was responsive
[29:47] um and we thank him very much. Uh and
[29:50] yes
[29:52] all of you thank you once more for all
[29:53] the support that you gave him. Thank
[29:55] you.

[51:17] So
[51:20] in the week
[51:22] [Music]
[51:25] a word came up
[51:29] and this word was foundation
[51:33] and so
[51:40] bonus sisters
[51:44] and I had a lot of. So what I would do
[51:54] and then
[51:58] ready for phone
[52:00] and in doing that
[52:03] um I for whatever reason would run
[52:07] towards
[52:13] [Music]
[52:18] as I know him.
[52:22] I'm going ahead of myself. I'll come
[52:24] back to that story. Let me start with
[52:27] some memories that I remember.
[52:30] So, Baba
[52:32] [Music]
[52:34] very much so.
[52:37] Mama when I was about two I think
[52:46] had to leave nursing school and so papa
[52:51] became the primary parent
[52:56] and he became you know my go-to. Um, so
[53:01] one of my memories are um
[53:05] [Music]
[53:16] cook up. she could cook
[53:21] and I just walk past her
[53:26] because papa was my person
[53:30] and mama would get so hurt and in fact I
[53:34] I I wasn't friends with my mother. I was
[53:37] thinking about this for a very long time
[53:40] because Baba was the foundation.
[53:43] And um one other memory I have is um
[53:53] primary school. So I say this I say I
[53:57] this story is around foundation. So this
[53:59] is these are my formative years where
[54:01] you know I'm shaped where my personality
[54:04] is being molded. Um primary school
[54:20] So papa I'm sure he thought
[54:27] every Sundays we'd go to church
[54:31] at the time I think was in boarding
[54:33] school.
[54:38] And then
[54:45] again,
[54:53] I'd say
[55:00] and he wasn't going to have it. I'm sure
[55:04] now that I'm older, it's because
[55:09] And I was thinking actually I'm not I've
[55:12] never been a girly girl because
[55:19] and I've never really cared about her.
[55:22] But there's a quote about trauma and we
[55:24] talk we talked about trauma in the week
[55:27] that we have from our parents and
[55:29] there's a quote I'd like to to share.
[55:33] Trauma decontextualized in a person
[55:35] looks like personality.
[55:38] Trauma decontextualized
[55:40] in a family looks like family traits.
[55:43] And trauma decontextualized
[55:46] in a people looks like culture.
[55:51] So
[55:52] I look at myself now and I'm like
[55:57] in this week I've been reflecting
[56:01] [Music]
[56:03] They some of them traumatized me. One
[56:05] good because I was never again a girly
[56:08] girl ever.
[56:17] So whether holiday
[56:20] we would have to wake up was always up
[56:23] by
[56:27] so
[56:33] [Music]
[56:44] So that would mean
[56:48] student.
[56:54] So that would mean
[56:59] and that and I feel today I can't sleep
[57:02] past a certain time and
[57:06] because they're not allowed in the
[57:08] kitchen.
[57:11] So it's become a personality but it
[57:14] started off with trauma. So what I'm
[57:17] saying is some trauma will shape us and
[57:20] I think we should look at what our
[57:23] parents tried to do and appreciate
[57:26] you know they were shaping us.
[57:28] Okay. So let's go to the next memory. So
[57:31] this memory I I would hope that fathers
[57:36] um learn from
[57:38] because
[57:40] papa was a he was I would describe him
[57:44] as a silent but very
[57:50] present love. I do not think my father
[57:55] ever told me he loved me, but I
[57:58] completely knew it because he was
[58:02] constantly there. So at this time
[58:15] We are
[58:17] the choir competition
[58:20] and
[58:24] another thing about my father he was
[58:25] practical
[58:28] in the absence of my mama 6 to6u
[58:33] became a deputy parent and I I have a
[58:36] memory of and I
[58:45] And get strict instructions
[58:58] because my father was very practical.
[59:06] I'm the only one
[59:11] and I have tried. I have pleaded and
[59:14] he's not having it. So I I've given up.
[59:17] Okay, I'll be that girl. So
[59:23] and we were just about to leave.
[59:30] I think I'm in maybe
[59:34] [Music]
[59:45] [Music]
[59:53] I have never been with so much pride.
[59:56] Baba had gone and bought me a jersey
[59:59] because I had cried.
[1:00:05] So I think that to fathers
[1:00:08] showing up like that for your girls. I
[1:00:11] remember I was skinny. I was very
[1:00:13] skinny. But I remember walking out
[1:00:15] wearing that cardigan and feeling like I
[1:00:18] own the world with so much confidence
[1:00:22] because
[1:00:23] [Music]
[1:00:26] So that's that's one memory. The last I
[1:00:29] hope um now I'm going to bring it to
[1:00:34] my this week. What's happened this week?
[1:00:38] So in this week now I'm coming back to
[1:00:40] me running in this week.
[1:00:46] And as I ran
[1:00:48] I I don't know how I got drawn to
[1:00:50] running.
[1:00:54] And I realized
[1:00:59] when I was young, okay, I'm going to
[1:01:02] come back to what said
[1:01:09] that's another trauma actually.
[1:01:14] I hate fish. Brown bread.
[1:01:29] Everything
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:39] would not have it. So,
[1:01:47] so then
[1:01:51] you'd say
[1:01:55] I would do that. I'm guilty of that. So,
[1:01:58] every so often.
[1:02:02] And then one day
[1:02:05] during the holidays,
[1:02:25] no man, this is not
[1:02:31] lost
[1:02:32] So I used to go to Los. Now I'm coming
[1:02:35] back to my memory of running there.
[1:02:40] I imagine papa was in his maybe mid-4s
[1:02:43] and
[1:02:45] so I walk in
[1:02:53] and I can imagine he was 45.
[1:02:58] I'm not allowed in there. That was the
[1:03:02] only time
[1:03:08] and that became a tradition. So
[1:03:22] because that's what my friends would
[1:03:23] say.
[1:03:27] So that was the only money I could get
[1:03:29] from my father.
[1:03:34] And in conclusion, with all of these,
[1:03:37] you know, these
[1:03:39] characters that were built um through
[1:03:42] him being really my primary care, my
[1:03:45] primary caregiver or primary parent for
[1:03:48] the formative years.
[1:03:50] Um
[1:03:52] um
[1:03:55] and I would walk. So it was I think it
[1:03:57] was 3 days that I did this. I would walk
[1:04:00] and kind of pay respect to these
[1:04:02] memories of me growing up
[1:04:05] and then I run back home these past 3
[1:04:08] days. And then it occurred to me I have
[1:04:11] not walked
[1:04:14] to here since I was that child, that
[1:04:17] kid, that little girl. And it it made me
[1:04:20] feel so good. And then what happened in
[1:04:22] the week also is that
[1:04:25] on two occasions primary school friends
[1:04:27] of mine came
[1:04:34] and I was so excited to see them and I
[1:04:38] thought this is actually a gift of you
[1:04:41] know it took me through memory lane
[1:04:44] and so now I bring it to the present and
[1:04:47] the present being
[1:04:50] I think Since I have a journal entry
[1:04:54] that um in fact this it starts here a
[1:04:58] ginal a youth group that I belong to
[1:05:00] yoker that we've been attending for men
[1:05:04] since I was about also formative 10 11
[1:05:06] 12 and we've stayed together since and
[1:05:11] so um this season I'd say the past two
[1:05:15] years has been a season of loss for all
[1:05:18] of
[1:05:24] We've been singing this song
[1:05:27] 183
[1:05:33] and I would I think for the first time
[1:05:36] because I heard it over and over again.
[1:05:38] I started paying attention to these
[1:05:40] words and I thought hey man I must find
[1:05:43] this one.
[1:05:45] I I need to memorize this because it was
[1:05:47] healing to me. And then I tried, you
[1:05:51] know, I I got it,
[1:05:54] you know, the Lord is my shepherd. Psalm
[1:05:56] 23.
[1:05:58] I I
[1:06:01] like I tried and I wanted to memorize it
[1:06:04] so that I keep saying it.
[1:06:06] And then in this youth group,
[1:06:11] one
[1:06:15] group
[1:06:22] something clicked. Now this is one of
[1:06:25] the psalms that you will say at school.
[1:06:28] You had to memorize. I think
[1:06:32] and something clicked and then I saw
[1:06:35] happy. And this is I diorized it in
[1:06:44] June
[1:06:46] of course cuz course now I can't find it
[1:06:49] but I think it was in the 25th of June
[1:06:53] so that I I knew it and because I had
[1:06:57] known it before it stuck
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:01] and I've been saying it
[1:07:03] since then and so to my I don't know I
[1:07:08] think I was so
[1:07:13] I was so emotional when this youth group
[1:07:17] came on Wednesday but
[1:07:21] and Lind was 23
[1:07:24] and so I've been preparing since the
[1:07:27] 25th for this day and
[1:07:33] I was so emotional if I didn't know God
[1:07:37] was here. Now I do. And I'm going to
[1:07:40] invite all of us
[1:07:45] to recite it with me.
[1:07:51] I'm going to stop.
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:12] Foreign
[1:08:24] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:51] [Music]
[1:08:55] [Applause]
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:08:59] Hallelujah.
[1:09:06] A round of applause for my sister.
[1:09:09] [Applause]
[1:09:13] So, she's actually taken all the
[1:09:16] weights. So, well done. You presented me
[1:09:21] very well.
[1:09:24] So I'm I'm I'm just going to try to also
[1:09:28] redeem time because I think a lot has
[1:09:32] been said.
[1:09:34] You know, I'll just say something uh
[1:09:37] also because it so happens that I'm the
[1:09:42] last one to see him before he departs.
[1:09:46] Uh it happens that on a Thursday last
[1:09:49] week Thursday he visited he came to my
[1:09:52] house uh through the help of my brother
[1:09:55] who brought him to my house and then he
[1:09:58] spent the weekend with us. So little did
[1:10:02] I know that that was the last weekend.
[1:10:06] Um but one of the things that my father
[1:10:09] was very smart
[1:10:12] um he was very observant.
[1:10:16] Uh he he he you know he could see things
[1:10:20] into details. H and when he talks it's
[1:10:23] after you know he has analyzed
[1:10:25] everything.
[1:10:26] Um so and I knew that you know through
[1:10:30] the journey of life um somewhere I had
[1:10:34] converted you know to other belief you
[1:10:38] know and um I knew that
[1:10:42] I cannot preach to him
[1:10:44] um
[1:10:47] because of certain reasons. Um but when
[1:10:50] he visited me what we would do uh during
[1:10:55] co we spent time together and I we would
[1:10:59] uh put in because we were not going to
[1:11:02] out we just put a church service in and
[1:11:07] look at the
[1:11:09] monitor h you know someone's being
[1:11:11] preached and um because he's very
[1:11:15] observant he was observing and he had
[1:11:18] comments on the sideline. But the brief
[1:11:20] of it is that
[1:11:23] one of the days he said to me,
[1:11:27] "When I depart,
[1:11:31] I want these people that you worship
[1:11:34] with to be the ones that bury me." Now
[1:11:39] not in a bad way but I don't know for
[1:11:41] what reasons but I think there are
[1:11:44] certain things that he saw
[1:11:47] in the last moments and he said this is
[1:11:51] how I would want to depart. We from we
[1:11:54] are Anglican as a family where I grew
[1:11:57] up. But his words to me was that
[1:12:02] when I depart I want you to arrange for
[1:12:07] me with the people that you worship
[1:12:09] with. So on that that is why we didn't
[1:12:13] you know go to Anglican. It was just in
[1:12:16] honor of his wishes that he he wanted.
[1:12:21] Then um to repeat,
[1:12:24] I'm going to
[1:12:26] um put it this way.
[1:12:30] He was okay from Thursday,
[1:12:34] Friday,
[1:12:37] Saturday,
[1:12:40] Sunday.
[1:12:42] That's when he started to
[1:12:46] um show some signs of you know
[1:12:49] instability
[1:12:51] and he started by throwing out first and
[1:12:55] then I think he did twice thrice then
[1:12:58] after that I mixed a concussion that we
[1:13:01] call moto
[1:13:03] you know to try and replenish the fluids
[1:13:05] lost and then he drank half a cup and he
[1:13:09] felt a little bit better Now uh with my
[1:13:12] son we said no you are tired
[1:13:16] let's take you to rest he answered asked
[1:13:20] he said I'm resting where I am
[1:13:24] actually he said I'm already resting
[1:13:29] at that point I didn't it didn't
[1:13:32] register you know but because he was
[1:13:35] weak we decided to take his bed and put
[1:13:39] it where were sitting so that we could
[1:13:42] observe him. And that night I decided to
[1:13:44] sleep on a couch next to him so that if
[1:13:48] he needs to go out to the toilet or
[1:13:50] something, I'm close by, you know. And
[1:13:54] um
[1:13:56] little did I know that after that that
[1:14:00] was his last time uh to sleep. So in the
[1:14:04] morning when I woke up, he was no more.
[1:14:08] But I could tell that he departed in a
[1:14:11] peaceful way and to keep it.
[1:14:17] So on a Monday morning because I
[1:14:19] realized in the morning when my son was
[1:14:23] going to his work,
[1:14:26] he also realized that uh something is
[1:14:28] not right here. So when he was driving,
[1:14:31] he called me on his way. He said, "Dad,
[1:14:34] did you check his pulse?"
[1:14:37] I said to him, "Yes,
[1:14:40] he's no."
[1:14:43] So, there was a colleague that they
[1:14:45] travel together to work. Two two of them
[1:14:48] actually. So, one of the colleagues um
[1:14:51] lift club
[1:14:53] said to my son, "Let
[1:14:57] me put it this way."
[1:15:00] My son dropped them off. He went to his
[1:15:02] work and then later one of the people
[1:15:06] text my son to say, "Um, I heard you
[1:15:09] talking about someone who is now late.
[1:15:16] Is this man that you're talking about?
[1:15:21] Short hair, short gray hair, skinny,
[1:15:26] and his beard are like those of a goat."
[1:15:30] You know, goats have
[1:15:33] Then
[1:15:35] then the the the description was so
[1:15:38] precise that my son wondered because
[1:15:43] this person didn't know my father but he
[1:15:46] describes him exactly the way he looks.
[1:15:50] So he said
[1:15:53] I couldn't sleep from 12:00
[1:15:58] at night.
[1:16:00] There were this man was in my dream
[1:16:03] until about 4:00 and he was always
[1:16:07] staring at me
[1:16:10] and that actually was a confirmation to
[1:16:12] me that it means my father
[1:16:15] passed on around 4:00 a.m. in the
[1:16:18] morning because he said the dream left
[1:16:20] me 4:00 a.m. but I struggled with the
[1:16:24] dream throughout the night. So that gave
[1:16:27] me comfort that
[1:16:30] uh you know he departed
[1:16:32] in a peaceful way. On that note, I'm
[1:16:36] going to ask just to redeem time
[1:16:41] erh the next
[1:16:45] speakers, not the the speakers actually
[1:16:48] the next item which is going to be the
[1:16:51] reading of rats so that they can come to
[1:16:55] the form h and then after that it will
[1:16:59] be the reading of the obituary and then
[1:17:02] I will leave the sermon for past uh so
[1:17:05] that um we can be able to go out having
[1:17:10] listened to
[1:17:13] um having listened to
[1:17:17] uh the word of God. So let me do this.
[1:17:20] Sorry before I rush to that. We've got
[1:17:23] grandchildren first. Yeah.
[1:17:29] And
[1:17:30] they can come to the
[1:17:34] And then after them
[1:17:36] h is going to be grandchildren.
[1:17:41] After the grandchildren
[1:17:44] is going to be the rhythm of life.
[1:17:55] Good morning.
[1:18:00] your potato and your friends.
[1:18:10] We're pretty much last born 1175 Dong
[1:18:14] Street.
[1:18:18] Growing up, my siblings and I were
[1:18:22] incredibly lucky.
[1:18:24] We had the rare and beautiful blessing
[1:18:29] of being raised by all four of our
[1:18:32] grandparents.
[1:18:35] And you know, each of them played a very
[1:18:38] specific powerful role in shaping who we
[1:18:42] are today.
[1:18:44] On our maternal side, there's Gabby who
[1:18:48] taught us all about style, but more
[1:18:50] importantly anchored us in spirituality
[1:18:53] and religion. And then there's our
[1:18:55] grandfather
[1:18:57] beam. He's the most calm and the most
[1:19:00] loving man you'll ever meet. He never
[1:19:02] forgets to remind us how beautiful we
[1:19:04] are.
[1:19:06] And then on the paternal side, we had
[1:19:09] the late Noisa.
[1:19:12] She was strict and fierce and she was
[1:19:15] independent.
[1:19:17] She taught us to be liberal and
[1:19:20] rethinking.
[1:19:24] And then there was Dr. Mo,
[1:19:30] the man we're here to honor today.
[1:19:36] He was the embodiment of discipline,
[1:19:39] routine, and what we call today
[1:19:42] selfcare.
[1:19:44] He taught us how to show love in our own
[1:19:48] way.
[1:19:51] And what did that look like?
[1:19:53] Okay, so one of my biggest pet peeves in
[1:19:56] life is people who don't respect time.
[1:20:00] Being on time is not a courtesy to me.
[1:20:03] It's one of my strongest traits and a
[1:20:05] strong value I live by. It's a value I
[1:20:08] learned from Dolo.
[1:20:11] For Dooo, being late was never an
[1:20:14] option. In fact, being on time is not
[1:20:17] good enough. Holo would take us to
[1:20:20] school. All you hear, hey
[1:20:24] little,
[1:20:28] whether at some point we had to take him
[1:20:30] to the appointment. Hey mining, the
[1:20:33] roads are packed. You don't know what's
[1:20:35] going on outside.
[1:20:37] That was his thing.
[1:20:40] And on the selfare element,
[1:20:45] I think alluded to this earlier.
[1:20:57] And these are the traits that we carry
[1:20:59] as adults today.
[1:21:02] And then of course as mentioned um he
[1:21:04] was a man of routine and discipline. So
[1:21:08] part of his routine was his he'd always
[1:21:11] used the same way whether
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:15] it was always the same way. So much so
[1:21:18] when was still around
[1:21:21] we'd always be like
[1:21:24] he always takes the same way you know.
[1:21:27] So we used to tease that it was boring
[1:21:30] going with him because unlike Dudu, he
[1:21:32] never took detours. If he was fetching
[1:21:34] you, you knew that you're going straight
[1:21:36] home. Duaka after school and then you'd
[1:21:39] go on errands on errands on errands. It
[1:21:42] would eat into homework time. But with
[1:21:45] you knew he's going to fetch you, you're
[1:21:46] going home. So when it was exam time,
[1:21:49] you definitely wanted Damo to fetch you
[1:21:51] because there was no time to waste.
[1:21:54] Looking back now, it was just part of
[1:21:56] his steady, predictable way. The kind of
[1:21:58] consistency you could count on. For him,
[1:22:02] his love was structure, routine, and
[1:22:05] showing up consistently. That was his
[1:22:08] way of caring for us.
[1:22:11] And I can say I don't think I ever heard
[1:22:14] that say, "I love you."
[1:22:17] But like Nikki said, you would see it.
[1:22:22] uh when I was living with them in grade
[1:22:23] 8 and nine, my dad would send me an
[1:22:26] allowance and my grandparents would keep
[1:22:28] my card and I what my grandmother was
[1:22:32] doing I think she wanted me to be
[1:22:34] cognizant of how I spend money. So if I
[1:22:37] needed anything I would have to say
[1:22:41] and then she would write down all my
[1:22:43] costs. At the end of the month she'll
[1:22:45] take me to Absa so I can withdraw and
[1:22:48] pay her back what she gave me.
[1:22:51] And then I realized Hollywood would
[1:22:54] never ask me to pay him back as papa.
[1:22:59] So that's when I learned that's the guy
[1:23:02] when a sparkling water when chocolate
[1:23:05] when a magazine he bought it all for me
[1:23:08] and that is how he showed me love.
[1:23:13] You know when it was tense after we had
[1:23:16] had a fight, my grandfa my grandmother
[1:23:18] would say,
[1:23:26] "And yes, we will cry.
[1:23:31] We miss them.
[1:23:34] And yes, we always will.
[1:23:38] But we also smile
[1:23:41] because the love,
[1:23:43] the lessons,
[1:23:46] and the memories that Molo left behind,
[1:23:50] they'll stay with us forever. Dr. Molo,
[1:23:53] thank you so much for showing us
[1:23:55] discipline, pride, and routine. Thank
[1:23:59] you for loving us in your own strong,
[1:24:02] steady way. We'll carry your legacy
[1:24:05] early
[1:24:07] bathed and prioritizing routine just as
[1:24:10] you would have wanted.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Rest well now.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; We love you.
[1:24:19] [Applause]
[1:24:31] Zoeto
[1:24:36] mat.
[1:24:40] Okay.
[1:24:42] All right.
[1:24:45] Yes.
[1:24:55] [Music]
[1:25:04] [Music]
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:16] As soon as we all stand for me to
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:29] get up and twer.
[1:25:32] [Music]
[1:25:38] [Music]
[1:25:48] High.
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the wonderful name of
[1:26:04] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:26:06] Amen.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; I'm about to start the reading of the
[1:26:10] obituary. It reads as follows. We gather
[1:26:13] today to honor and celebrate the life of
[1:26:16] Moro, affectionately known as Braziliza
[1:26:19] Elas Mulot, who passed away peacefully
[1:26:22] on the 4th of August 2025 at the age of
[1:26:25] 84.
[1:26:27] Born on the 8th of November in 1940 in
[1:26:31] Chanty Town Apex to the late Machaya
[1:26:34] Multo and Latias Kosan Moro Gaspent's
[1:26:38] elderly childhood in Chanty Town before
[1:26:41] his family was relocated to Davidton in
[1:26:44] 1950 during the forced removals of
[1:26:47] apartate.
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:54] A bright and dedicated student, Morag
[1:26:56] began his schooling at St. Andrew's
[1:26:58] Missionary School. He then proceeded to
[1:27:01] study at JC Mahungala Secondary School.
[1:27:04] He received a bizarre in 1957 to study
[1:27:07] at Kilan High School where he
[1:27:10] metriculated in 1959.
[1:27:12] After metriculating, despite his desire
[1:27:15] to further his studies, he was compelled
[1:27:17] to work back his bursery by assuming
[1:27:20] employment with the town council,
[1:27:22] managing liquor outlets in Davidton with
[1:27:24] discipline and responsibility. He later
[1:27:27] served as a finance administrator at the
[1:27:30] men's host until his retirement after
[1:27:33] which he ran a school transport business
[1:27:36] with pride and dedication.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Morning everyone. Um, once again, thank
[1:27:43] you for being here. Um, about my
[1:27:47] grandfather, he was a man of discipline,
[1:27:50] punctuality, and strong values. But even
[1:27:55] with those strong values, some of you
[1:27:57] are blessed to know that he couldn't
[1:27:59] resist stealing a spoon of sugar from
[1:28:01] the cupboard.
[1:28:03] However, he can rest easy now, knowing
[1:28:05] none of us will catch him.
[1:28:08] Earlier, I mentioned punctuality.
[1:28:11] Yo, papa was serious about that. He
[1:28:14] would let nothing stop him.
[1:28:16] Once he was at my house and it was the
[1:28:19] morning he was due to go back home. His
[1:28:22] transport soon arrived, but at that time
[1:28:24] I was in the shower and like I said,
[1:28:27] nothing would stop him. So soaking wet
[1:28:30] in a towel, he made sure I opened the
[1:28:32] gate for him just so he could maintain
[1:28:35] his punctuality.
[1:28:37] I didn't get a chance to say goodbye,
[1:28:39] but if it meant us having a conversation
[1:28:41] in my shower once again, I'd gladly take
[1:28:44] it.
[1:28:47] Mo was a man of discipline, punctuality,
[1:28:49] and strong values, which he instilled in
[1:28:51] this family. In 1967, he married the
[1:28:55] late Napoa, and they raised three
[1:28:57] children together.
[1:29:00] Moroka IAS Modo will be remembered for
[1:29:02] his quiet
[1:29:05] for his quiet strength, deep commitment
[1:29:07] and unwavering principles.
[1:29:10] He has survived by his sister Dia, his
[1:29:13] children,
[1:29:15] Muetsi and Naniki and his grandchildren
[1:29:20] Landumo
[1:29:22] Mli
[1:29:25] Vway
[1:29:29] and
[1:29:37] way.
[1:29:46] A
[1:29:50] mal
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:30:30] The word of the Okay.
[1:30:34] Peter
[1:30:51] so
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:57] no my
[1:31:00] simple Oh,
[1:31:04] single
[1:31:06] to
[1:31:07] [Music]
[1:31:21] my God.
[1:31:23] Oh my god.
[1:31:31] [Music]
[1:32:01] [Music]
[1:32:11] I would like to greet you all in the
[1:32:13] precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; My name is Peter Scosana.
[1:32:22] I was requested by
[1:32:25] our brother Lord
[1:32:28] just to come and deliver some few words
[1:32:31] of comfort to the family.
[1:32:35] Uh we fellowship together
[1:32:39] with our brother
[1:32:43] Met.
[1:32:45] So I just will
[1:32:49] bring some few words. I I always
[1:32:54] have a problem when we are in a funeral,
[1:32:58] more especially expressing ourself in
[1:33:00] English
[1:33:03] because our tradition is that now we are
[1:33:06] blacks we have to use our language
[1:33:10] but uh
[1:33:12] for the sake of time
[1:33:16] said no we can go on but if there's
[1:33:18] somebody that is not comfortable
[1:33:21] We have an interpreter who could come
[1:33:24] over and interpret.
[1:33:26] You just speak to Mete or whoever it is
[1:33:30] who's not comfortable who cannot hear
[1:33:32] English. So mine is to bring now the
[1:33:36] words of comfort
[1:33:38] of which uh
[1:33:42] it's a difficult thing to do
[1:33:45] because there's nobody that can comfort
[1:33:49] uh
[1:33:51] somebody that has lost his loved one.
[1:33:54] The only way of comforting that person
[1:33:57] is to bring that person back of which I
[1:34:01] can't resurrect him.
[1:34:04] So maybe we'll just bow our heads before
[1:34:08] we read the word.
[1:34:11] Mighty God, eternal father, creator of
[1:34:14] all things,
[1:34:17] thou who was,
[1:34:19] who is, and who will live eternally.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You so loved us, Father, that you
[1:34:26] shed your blood at Mount Calvary
[1:34:30] so that we could be safe
[1:34:33] and you even gave us your word to bring
[1:34:37] the knowledge and understanding
[1:34:39] of everything that you are doing.
[1:34:42] Thank you father now that we are
[1:34:44] gathered here
[1:34:46] as I've uttered some few words that
[1:34:49] nobody can bring any comfort to anybody.
[1:34:52] You are the only one Lord. So we pray
[1:34:56] gracious heavenly father that the words
[1:34:59] that we're going to read here may they
[1:35:02] find place in our hearts
[1:35:05] and be a comfort father. Thank you
[1:35:07] father for we pray calling upon the name
[1:35:11] of our lord Jesus Christ. Amen and amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Okay. I will read
[1:35:19] from the book of Psalms
[1:35:23] uh Psalms 27.
[1:35:26] I will read just two verses. Psalms 27
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:33] verse three says,
[1:35:37] "Though an host should encamp against
[1:35:40] me, my heart shall not fear.
[1:35:45] Though war should rise against me,
[1:35:49] in this will I be confident."
[1:35:54] Verse four, one thing that I desired of
[1:35:58] the Lord, that that will I seek after,
[1:36:03] that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:36:05] Lord all the days of my life,
[1:36:09] to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to
[1:36:12] inquire in his temple.
[1:36:15] You may be seated. God bless you.
[1:36:20] Yeah. What I want to share with you here
[1:36:24] is that now David here saw he said one
[1:36:28] thing that he desired of the Lord
[1:36:34] and he seek that says now one thing that
[1:36:37] I desire and and what I seek
[1:36:42] after is that I may dwell in the house
[1:36:45] of the Lord. Let me just maybe say that
[1:36:48] will be my title.
[1:36:51] dwelling in the house of the Lord.
[1:36:54] And then he says here that uh while he
[1:36:59] dwelling in the house of the Lord
[1:37:02] not temporarily says now all the days of
[1:37:08] his life.
[1:37:10] Now how can you dwell in the house of
[1:37:13] the Lord?
[1:37:15] So all the days of your life
[1:37:21] because he's speaking about beholding
[1:37:24] the beauty of the Lord
[1:37:27] and to inquire.
[1:37:31] So now when when uh somebody has
[1:37:34] departed,
[1:37:37] there is that uh
[1:37:40] gloomy feeling
[1:37:44] uh of which you
[1:37:48] you can't control it. It just comes
[1:37:51] automatically.
[1:37:54] Though
[1:37:55] we know all of us that we have to depart
[1:38:00] but there are some things that we hear.
[1:38:05] Some says when somebody has departed
[1:38:10] has gone to heaven.
[1:38:13] Some says has gone to hell.
[1:38:17] Some says no. You just become a wind.
[1:38:22] And some says, "No,
[1:38:25] you're going to meet your ancestors.
[1:38:27] You're going to sit with them and relax
[1:38:30] there."
[1:38:33] Now, some knows the truth.
[1:38:37] Some are very innocent. They don't know
[1:38:39] the truth.
[1:38:42] I've I've lost my sister
[1:38:46] h yesterday. So I was with my niece then
[1:38:51] they said to me uncle
[1:38:53] as we are planning
[1:38:56] they said
[1:38:59] should we bring the coffin
[1:39:02] here on Friday
[1:39:06] I said okay why why
[1:39:09] so it's two boys I said tell me why do
[1:39:12] you want to bring your coffee here I
[1:39:14] don't say don't bring it just want to
[1:39:17] No.
[1:39:20] And then he says, "No, uncle, it's our
[1:39:22] culture.
[1:39:25] It's our culture." I said, "No, I am."
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:32] And then our culture has got no coffee.
[1:39:36] In our culture, we dig a hole,
[1:39:39] we slaughter a cow, we cover the body
[1:39:43] with a with a with a with the skin.
[1:39:47] So now
[1:39:49] you're talking about the
[1:39:52] Okay. They said okay fine uncle
[1:39:56] should we remove the furniture
[1:39:59] and take the goles to the rooms
[1:40:03] and
[1:40:05] so that when people come they must visit
[1:40:07] and go into that room.
[1:40:11] I said,
[1:40:15] "Where did you get that?"
[1:40:18] Then they said,
[1:40:20] "It's our culture, uncle."
[1:40:24] I said, "Where did you get that
[1:40:25] culture?"
[1:40:28] All right. But now I was just teasing
[1:40:31] them. I know that when I'm saying that
[1:40:34] some are saying where does this man come
[1:40:36] from
[1:40:40] so I was just teasing them now because
[1:40:44] in life you have to go to a point where
[1:40:48] you have the knowledge and understanding
[1:40:52] about your life your life and you have
[1:40:56] to know
[1:40:59] have a knowledge and understanding that
[1:41:00] when somebody's departing
[1:41:04] Exactly.
[1:41:05] Without guessing,
[1:41:08] you should know you know that person
[1:41:12] when it departs is going to and what
[1:41:15] what is to depart. That is the
[1:41:17] separation of the soul and the spirit.
[1:41:19] Isn't it? We all know that
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; the soul separates from the spirit. As
[1:41:26] you are alive right now, you've got your
[1:41:29] mind that controls your body. That's not
[1:41:32] scientific. It's it's just a simple
[1:41:34] thing. Your body is controlled by your
[1:41:37] mind. At times it relaxes. You go to
[1:41:40] sleep. You know that subconscious and
[1:41:43] conscious they they sort of separate and
[1:41:46] then they engage again in the morning.
[1:41:48] You stretch yourself. We are yourself.
[1:41:50] You continue.
[1:41:52] So now that's why I say some knows that
[1:41:57] you know this world is not our own. were
[1:42:01] just passes by.
[1:42:03] Uh you could see I'm gayheaded.
[1:42:06] I was once a young man was once very
[1:42:09] energetic and running
[1:42:11] but I could see that the days are
[1:42:13] numbered.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; So I should not pretend as though I
[1:42:17] don't see that.
[1:42:19] So
[1:42:22] you might say are those the words of
[1:42:24] comfort?
[1:42:26] No, those are the words. You know, in
[1:42:29] the olden days, we used to be afraid of
[1:42:32] a
[1:42:34] when the night comes,
[1:42:37] can't go out. Even if the parent says go
[1:42:39] and get water, you say baba,
[1:42:44] and then you've never seen it, but it's
[1:42:48] there.
[1:42:50] See, so now when it comes to the
[1:42:53] departure or the so-called death,
[1:42:58] people get into that trends.
[1:43:01] Why do they get into that trends?
[1:43:04] Because we've got uh different
[1:43:06] dimensions.
[1:43:08] Some dimensions are are scientical,
[1:43:12] some are spiritual. Amen.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; The scientical one, you could understand
[1:43:19] it with your mind,
[1:43:22] but the supernatural one, you have to be
[1:43:25] supernatural to understand it.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; You have to be spiritual to understand
[1:43:30] it. There's a body that was born
[1:43:34] by your parents,
[1:43:37] but there's another body that is not
[1:43:38] born from your parents. It comes from
[1:43:41] God.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; It comes into that body.
[1:43:45] When this body that is born by the
[1:43:47] parents
[1:43:50] h
[1:43:51] it had no life
[1:43:54] until the nurse spank it
[1:43:59] and then then life comes into that body
[1:44:03] and then when the life comes into that
[1:44:06] body you're saying
[1:44:13] Right.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; But when the when that child reaches a
[1:44:19] certain stage,
[1:44:22] he should be taught. Okay. All the time
[1:44:25] he will be taught
[1:44:27] about this kosanas, how we live, all the
[1:44:30] traditions and everything.
[1:44:34] But we should understand that now
[1:44:37] actually there is God who created
[1:44:40] heaven, who created earth, who created
[1:44:42] everything.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:44:46] We should not pretend as though we don't
[1:44:48] see that we know that there is God and
[1:44:51] we should know that. Now there's a time
[1:44:54] where we need to engage ourself with
[1:44:57] that God.
[1:44:59] His ways are very difficult compared
[1:45:04] to the life that we are living here.
[1:45:06] It's very difficult.
[1:45:09] But we have to
[1:45:12] now when now David here speaks about
[1:45:17] living in the house of the Lord. How can
[1:45:20] you do that? The only way of doing that
[1:45:24] is that now you take that life of God,
[1:45:29] let it be within yourself.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. or you yourself
[1:45:35] you are you'll be in him because there
[1:45:38] will be two people sharing the life
[1:45:41] because when he's speaking about the
[1:45:43] house of the lord l the lord has when he
[1:45:46] prepares you when he created you when he
[1:45:49] formed you he created his house in you
[1:45:55] when he want to visit you there is a
[1:45:58] place in your heart where he visits you
[1:46:01] that That is why he formed a man out of
[1:46:05] the dust of the earth. That man was not
[1:46:07] alive.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; He was not alive. He was like a no piece
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; until he breatheth the breath of life
[1:46:17] into that into that man. Then man became
[1:46:21] a living soul.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:24] So now when man became a living soul
[1:46:28] having the breath of life from God.
[1:46:31] So that man
[1:46:35] had a place when God want to visit that
[1:46:38] man he will visit him through the place
[1:46:41] that he himself himself has created in
[1:46:45] you. God cannot create you
[1:46:49] for a sweet boar roll.
[1:46:52] There is a reason why God created you.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; You are not here for fun.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; you are here for a reason. He's got a
[1:47:01] reason with God, with you.
[1:47:05] And his reason is supernatural.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Now, if his reason is supernatural, then
[1:47:11] he must create a box in you so that he
[1:47:15] must plant that supernatural to you.
[1:47:20] And that box that he has created in you
[1:47:22] is your soul.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Because you have a soul.
[1:47:28] And when God speaks to you, he does not
[1:47:31] speak to you through your mind.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:47:36] That is your lecturer that will speak
[1:47:38] you through your mind at the university.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; But when God visits you, regardless of
[1:47:44] who you are, he has created a place in
[1:47:47] your heart.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then it comes to your heart
[1:47:52] and that is supernatural. And the only
[1:47:56] thing that God needs from us is nothing
[1:47:59] else but just faith.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Because he says you cannot please him
[1:48:06] without faith.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; And faith is a substance of thing that
[1:48:09] you cannot see.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; You've never seen God. Not even a single
[1:48:13] one of us have seen God personally and
[1:48:15] say that's God.
[1:48:17] We have that faith that there is God.
[1:48:21] We've never seen heaven. It's written
[1:48:23] here that New Jerusalem is shining gold
[1:48:27] in blah blah blah. We've never seen it,
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; but we believe it.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Now, we compare and contrast. We were
[1:48:37] born taught in another way and there's
[1:48:40] word of God that came. Now you have to
[1:48:44] decide actually are you engaging to this
[1:48:47] or you throw it away you engage. If you
[1:48:49] don't engage to this this there's a
[1:48:52] repercussion.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:48:57] there is a word of God. Of course it's
[1:48:59] written here. It's a Bible. It's a
[1:49:00] paperwork.
[1:49:04] The words that are written here.
[1:49:08] Some says no. this thing comes through
[1:49:11] white people.
[1:49:13] We've got our own tradition as black
[1:49:15] people. Fine. There's no problem.
[1:49:18] But now
[1:49:21] me as a devel
[1:49:25] uh
[1:49:26] our tradition is that now we've got our
[1:49:30] ancestors.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; We got our ancestors. One day my uncle
[1:49:36] took me
[1:49:38] to uh ina
[1:49:42] I was sick. Then
[1:49:45] this man saw his bones
[1:49:49] and look at them said to my you see that
[1:49:51] one there is is skew
[1:49:55] which means this boy is going to suffer
[1:49:57] the rest of his life.
[1:50:01] So I was sitting there right within me I
[1:50:04] said this guy is telling lies I've got
[1:50:06] hands
[1:50:08] going to work and then he said
[1:50:12] baba baba this child of yours
[1:50:16] is denying what I'm saying I could hear
[1:50:21] my uncle chased me away and said go out
[1:50:26] you are tempering in a field that is not
[1:50:29] yours.
[1:50:32] So I I had to believe
[1:50:37] but I always wanted to challenge him and
[1:50:40] then I was not given a chance to
[1:50:41] challenge him because he will tell you
[1:50:45] it's our tradition. I said, "No, Baba,
[1:50:48] where does this tradition comes?" She
[1:50:50] said, "No, it's were born and born. We
[1:50:52] were born with that thing." Fine, but
[1:50:55] why don't we? I said, "No, now you're
[1:50:57] telling me about my great grandfather,
[1:51:01] right?
[1:51:03] Who couldn't
[1:51:05] help me with the school fees?
[1:51:09] I suffered with school fees and that was
[1:51:11] my grandfather. If you don't do that,
[1:51:14] your grandfather will squeeze your neck.
[1:51:17] So, so it's things like that and then
[1:51:19] comes the Bible now. The Bible now where
[1:51:21] does this thing come from and then our
[1:51:25] fathers will tell you know this thing is
[1:51:26] for the white ours is this way. But I
[1:51:29] said dad why is ours
[1:51:34] you know it is very cruel. You don't
[1:51:35] have to wear shoes. You don't wear this.
[1:51:38] Okay let me leave that. I'm here to tell
[1:51:40] you about
[1:51:42] how to live in the house of the Lord. To
[1:51:46] live in the house of the Lord.
[1:51:49] You you you know if if you say let us
[1:51:53] exchange life,
[1:51:55] let me be you so that you could be me.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; How would we do that?
[1:52:03] You know, uh Jonathan and David, they
[1:52:06] once did that. Jonathan wanted to be
[1:52:10] David. David wanted to be Jonathan.
[1:52:14] Actually, what they did, they exchanged
[1:52:16] thoughts only.
[1:52:18] But there was a time this man Abraham
[1:52:24] met God.
[1:52:26] When he met God,
[1:52:30] God
[1:52:32] gave off himself.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Which means then Abraham
[1:52:37] became God and God became Abraham
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; and that became one thing. So that's was
[1:52:43] a person that was created by God in the
[1:52:46] garden of Eden.
[1:52:48] God took his life
[1:52:52] like God is a spirit. God has got no
[1:52:55] beginning. He's got no end. He's got no
[1:52:58] mother. He's got no father. He's got no
[1:52:59] relity. His God is Elohim.
[1:53:03] But in order that he should be God, he
[1:53:06] must take a form.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Then that form is called the world.
[1:53:11] Still the word is invisible. You cannot
[1:53:13] see it.
[1:53:15] Then is a spirit. The spirit is also
[1:53:17] invisible. You cannot see a spirit.
[1:53:21] But then when God wants to be seen,
[1:53:25] he need to create his own body. That is
[1:53:28] why the scripture says a virgin shall
[1:53:31] conceive
[1:53:32] and bear a son.
[1:53:35] And that virgin,
[1:53:38] she conceived of God. She conceived the
[1:53:42] word of God. She does she didn't
[1:53:45] conceive a seed from a man. No.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; No. She met an angel. The angel said,
[1:53:52] "No, you will conceive." She said,
[1:53:54] "Never. Not me. I don't know any man.
[1:53:59] Then the angel said, "Is there anything
[1:54:02] hard for God?"
[1:54:05] Then the the woman said, "Let it be." In
[1:54:09] other words, now she receive. Let it be
[1:54:12] according to your word. What she
[1:54:16] received the seed of the word that she
[1:54:19] believe. And after she believed and then
[1:54:23] she conceived.
[1:54:24] That's why the Bible says
[1:54:30] uh the seed of God remains in you and
[1:54:34] the seed of God is the word and when
[1:54:37] that word comes into you it germinates
[1:54:43] it forms a supernatural person of which
[1:54:46] you cannot see that's why Jesus Christ
[1:54:48] was crucified
[1:54:51] because the word came into you and then
[1:54:54] he called it the father. He says, "No,
[1:54:57] the father is in me." They said, "Show
[1:54:59] us that father of yours." Said, "No,
[1:55:02] I've been with you for so long. You
[1:55:03] don't know me.
[1:55:06] I am in my father. My father is in me."
[1:55:11] That's it. Now, he dwelt in the house of
[1:55:15] the Lord. Amen.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Now when it dwell in the house of the
[1:55:19] Lord, it's when the word of God is in
[1:55:23] you and it germinates
[1:55:27] and forms the real you.
[1:55:30] The real Bab is not this this body that
[1:55:35] is in this
[1:55:37] what you call box. No, that's not him.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I'm standing before you
[1:55:42] speaking
[1:55:45] but the real me is not this body. This
[1:55:48] body is carrying me.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; The real me is the man inside me.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; That's the one. So now all of us should
[1:55:57] know that these
[1:56:00] that's why Bible says it's the that's
[1:56:02] why the Bible says
[1:56:05] uh
[1:56:07] this body is going to deteriorate
[1:56:11] right when it deteriorate the more you
[1:56:15] receive the weight
[1:56:19] the more this one gets older and older
[1:56:22] and deteriorate. We are talking here
[1:56:25] about eternal life, not a temporary
[1:56:27] life. Yes, sir.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Right? The word of God when it comes
[1:56:31] into you, it brings your real body.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; That is the body of the word. That's
[1:56:36] what you were before you became what you
[1:56:40] are.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; But that one came in process.
[1:56:44] In process as the word is preached, you
[1:56:48] believe it. And when you believe it and
[1:56:51] then that body starts forming into you.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; When Jesus Christ
[1:56:59] was crucified
[1:57:03] he was taken into a tomb
[1:57:08] and when he resurrected he resurrected
[1:57:10] with another body. That body could go
[1:57:13] anywhere. They will hide themselves. He
[1:57:16] will just go in and say peace be with
[1:57:18] you. Yes sir.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; With another boy. Now they will talk
[1:57:23] about him. He will go to them and say,
[1:57:26] "What are you saying?"
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; They said, "Where do you come from?"
[1:57:30] He's in another body.
[1:57:33] That's the body that will never die.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; But this one dies. The other one does
[1:57:41] not. But the one that does not die has
[1:57:44] got its own dimension and it's got its
[1:57:46] own direction and got its own things. If
[1:57:49] one believe the word of God,
[1:57:52] then the body of God, the part of God,
[1:57:56] that's why you'll be called the son of
[1:57:59] God. That is part of him.
[1:58:02] The word of God is his son.
[1:58:06] Right? If the word of God is his son and
[1:58:09] it comes to you and dwells within you,
[1:58:12] you become the son of God, not this
[1:58:14] body.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. the man
[1:58:18] of the wind that is in you.
[1:58:21] So now all of us you need to know
[1:58:26] actually why are we here in the world,
[1:58:31] why we are here.
[1:58:33] We are here just to demonstrate who we
[1:58:36] are.
[1:58:38] Right?
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks about the new heaven
[1:58:42] and the new earth.
[1:58:45] Right? And the Bible speaks about the
[1:58:48] end of the world,
[1:58:51] which means the world will end.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; It doesn't speak about the end of the
[1:58:55] earth.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; It speaks about the end of the world.
[1:58:59] The system will end.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; So there is life after death.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; There is life after death.
[1:59:11] The Bible says in the book of Peter, I
[1:59:15] think first Peter chapter 3 verse 9, it
[1:59:18] says,
[1:59:20] uh,
[1:59:23] after his death, he his spirit went to
[1:59:26] hell,
[1:59:29] spirit of Jesus Christ went to hell
[1:59:33] to preach
[1:59:35] to those spirits that repented, Lord.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:40] And then if you read it in Revelation
[1:59:43] 1:18, he says,
[1:59:46] "I was dead, but now I am alive."
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; And I've got the keys
[1:59:53] of death. He's got the keys of death.
[1:59:57] So the this
[1:59:59] death has got no power because he took
[2:00:02] that. You remember he said to Peter,
[2:00:05] "Peter,"
[2:00:07] and then they gave him the keys of the
[2:00:10] kingdom of heaven.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; And then he took the keys of death from
[2:00:16] the devil. So death is the death has got
[2:00:19] no power. Now the consolation is that
[2:00:23] that now there is no power in death. So
[2:00:26] we don't respect death
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; because it does not come from God.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right?
[2:00:34] So
[2:00:36] if the Bible says
[2:00:39] here
[2:00:41] Peter
[2:00:43] I mean uh David speaks about
[2:00:47] uh
[2:00:50] living
[2:00:51] or dwell in the house of the Lord all
[2:00:56] the days of his livelihood. He says,
[2:00:59] "Now he behold the beauty of the Lord
[2:01:03] and to inquire in his temple."
[2:01:06] I want us to read another scripture
[2:01:10] just to back this one up.
[2:01:14] It's it's it's in the book of Psalms
[2:01:17] chapter 34
[2:01:21] verse seven. It says here, "The angel of
[2:01:25] the Lord encamped
[2:01:28] round about them that fear him and
[2:01:32] deliverth them
[2:01:37] in order to live in the house of the
[2:01:39] Lord.
[2:01:41] There should be an angel of the Lord
[2:01:43] that is encamping around you."
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; By that does not mean there's an angel
[2:01:48] that is always going around you. No,
[2:01:54] that angel is nothing else. You see, it
[2:01:57] says now the the the angel of the Lord
[2:02:01] encamped round about them that fear him.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; And and deliver them.
[2:02:10] Now when you surrender your life to God,
[2:02:16] then you change your way of living.
[2:02:22] You take
[2:02:24] I mean your your your your your your
[2:02:27] manner of living
[2:02:30] become somebody else
[2:02:32] and that somebody else is the owner of
[2:02:35] the weight because you receive the
[2:02:37] weight. When you receive the weight,
[2:02:39] somebody comes within you in your heart
[2:02:42] and you become a changed person.
[2:02:46] Your personality and your character
[2:02:49] changes.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:02:53] Now when your personality and your
[2:02:55] character changes, it change and becomes
[2:02:58] what the word is. It becomes exactly you
[2:03:00] believe the word of God. That is why the
[2:03:03] Bible says he deliver them.
[2:03:08] We were born in sins all of us
[2:03:14] before our mothers delivered us there
[2:03:17] were two angels flying supernatural we
[2:03:21] don't see
[2:03:23] so immediately when we are born one
[2:03:25] angel came within you
[2:03:30] that is why you have to one day when you
[2:03:33] hear the word of god
[2:03:36] you have to take a decision to Uh-uh.
[2:03:39] No, I'm no more going that way. I want
[2:03:41] to leave this body. You see, God does
[2:03:45] not force anybody. Even in heaven, he
[2:03:47] never forced
[2:03:49] the angel of the cherubs.
[2:03:52] Said the choice is yours.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; It's not an opera size. He's not saying
[2:03:57] no, you take it or leave it. No, no.
[2:04:00] Just saying we are free. That's why
[2:04:03] Lucifer decided, okay, fine. I want to
[2:04:05] build my own kingdom. So fine.
[2:04:08] You could build your own kingdom but not
[2:04:10] here.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; So they fought. Then there's two
[2:04:14] kingdoms. This kingdom of the devil, the
[2:04:16] kingdom of God.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; So it depends on an individual.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Fine. It's yours.
[2:04:29] Okay.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; But here the the comforting word is to
[2:04:36] make people understand.
[2:04:40] The Bible says in the book of Ephesians
[2:04:43] chapter 1 verse 17. It says God God
[2:04:48] he he cannot just say come and worship
[2:04:50] you without assisting you. Never.
[2:04:53] It says God will give you a spirit
[2:04:58] and knowledge of understanding. He will
[2:05:00] give you
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; a spirit of knowledge and understanding.
[2:05:05] Help you.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; That is why he says I'll give you a
[2:05:09] comforter. You read it in in the book of
[2:05:11] John.
[2:05:14] I'll give you a comforter who will
[2:05:16] comfort you. Who will direct you? Will
[2:05:19] direct you.
[2:05:21] But that is doing it according to the
[2:05:23] predestination. You know that there are
[2:05:26] angels when the when when when when God
[2:05:29] and and and the devil were fighting in
[2:05:32] heaven,
[2:05:35] the devil managed to persuade some of
[2:05:38] the angels,
[2:05:41] right,
[2:05:42] to fight. And those angels, the Bible
[2:05:46] says, they left their
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; first estate.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; And because they left their first
[2:05:56] estate,
[2:05:58] so they took their own destination.
[2:06:01] There are those angels that says no, we
[2:06:03] are not leaving our first estate.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Right. That is their own predestination.
[2:06:11] So the choice is with somebody when the
[2:06:14] soul
[2:06:16] the spirit and the body separate
[2:06:20] the the body goes to the grave.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; The spirit goes back to God. Not all
[2:06:29] if it comes through. You know when Jesus
[2:06:30] Christ was been baptized,
[2:06:33] heaven opened the spirit came and
[2:06:37] dwell in him came like a dove until the
[2:06:40] voice says this is my beloved son in
[2:06:43] it comes from God.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Now if one does not surrender his life,
[2:06:50] the spirit cannot go to God.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. And the soul of the people
[2:06:56] that depart goes to different direction.
[2:07:00] It depends
[2:07:01] you know I understand one somebody
[2:07:05] was saying he's got two dogs in himself
[2:07:09] one is black one is white then they ask
[2:07:12] him actually which one do you like? Says
[2:07:14] no it depends on the one that you feed.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; It depends on on what you like.
[2:07:23] So when you depart,
[2:07:26] you go to a place where
[2:07:31] you are working for.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; As we are here on earth, we're doing
[2:07:36] we're serving. It depends on who you who
[2:07:39] are you serving.
[2:07:41] If you are serving those that have done
[2:07:45] poetry, you know about that guy who sold
[2:07:48] his soul to the devil.
[2:07:51] And then when the time comes now for the
[2:07:54] devil to come and fetch that soul,
[2:07:58] then they dramatize it and give you show
[2:08:02] you an hour before the devil comes with
[2:08:06] how is the reaction
[2:08:09] and you can check it with the great
[2:08:12] people that died.
[2:08:15] They confess that no all great people
[2:08:19] some says I was a fool.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; I should have taken the other direction
[2:08:25] because when death comes is where now
[2:08:28] you it's where now you take a decision
[2:08:31] and it would be too late. When you see
[2:08:34] the death comes with now let's go.
[2:08:38] The other people will never see you.
[2:08:41] It's a supernatural thing.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll be crying.
[2:08:46] You'll be shouting.
[2:08:48] You'll be doing this. Some will drive
[2:08:50] will go very peaceful.
[2:08:53] Some will go. We are not all going to
[2:08:56] the same direction. The Bible says, you
[2:09:01] read it the book of Acts
[2:09:04] chapter 13, I think it's verse 47.
[2:09:10] And you read it again in the book of
[2:09:12] Jude.
[2:09:13] Judas got only one chapter. You read
[2:09:15] verse six.
[2:09:17] He says that there are those that are
[2:09:19] ordained for condemnation. You can
[2:09:22] preach until you are red
[2:09:25] and you can preach until you ache. They
[2:09:27] won't take. They're predain.
[2:09:30] They are ordained for condemnation.
[2:09:32] There are those that are ordained for
[2:09:35] eternal life. Not that God is got upper
[2:09:38] gate. He says this one is is ordained
[2:09:41] for that. No, he gives you a free will.
[2:09:47] A free will. You you take your choice.
[2:09:49] Now when you depart,
[2:09:52] you go to a place where you're working
[2:09:57] for.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; That's that's how it is. Now, David here
[2:10:01] says, "Mine
[2:10:03] is to dwell in the house of the Lord."
[2:10:06] And to dwell in the house of the Lord is
[2:10:08] to receive the word of God. And to
[2:10:11] receive the word of God is to engage
[2:10:14] with him
[2:10:17] all the days of your life.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; That is why when we believe, we say we
[2:10:22] are believers, we believe the word of
[2:10:24] God, we we keep on praying, we keep on
[2:10:27] reading, we keep on asking questions
[2:10:30] about this and this and this.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because we want to know
[2:10:35] exactly this thing is it the truth or
[2:10:39] not. Now we are living at the last time.
[2:10:44] The Bible says there are those that will
[2:10:47] go before
[2:10:49] there are those that won't go.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; What those that won't go, they will
[2:10:54] change their bodies.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Because the spirit of God has got life
[2:11:00] in it. It's a seed.
[2:11:02] The seed
[2:11:05] has got what we call the gem of life in
[2:11:08] it. When you plant a seed, that seed has
[2:11:11] got the gem of life. It must germinate.
[2:11:13] Amen.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; So the word of God when we say we have
[2:11:17] received the word of God we mean this
[2:11:23] the blood I mean the the the the the the
[2:11:27] cell of our Lord Jesus Christ was broken
[2:11:33] and the life you know there is life in
[2:11:36] the blood. Now that life is a spirit.
[2:11:41] You are a spirit. You read it in Romans
[2:11:43] chapter 8:E1 16. It says our spirit and
[2:11:47] his spirit must come to mesh together.
[2:11:51] So your spirit and the spirit of God
[2:11:55] must come to a point where they are one
[2:11:58] thing. And then when there are one thing
[2:12:01] then you go to John
[2:12:06] 10 verse35
[2:12:08] it will tell you that now when the
[2:12:11] spirit of God is in you when you receive
[2:12:14] the word of God that makes you an
[2:12:16] amateur god that makes you a minor god
[2:12:20] and then when it makes you a minor god
[2:12:22] you you become a god but a minor one.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:26] Then when you are a minor god, look,
[2:12:30] there's nothing that God did without
[2:12:35] uh Adam knowing. There's nothing that
[2:12:38] Adam could do without God knowing.
[2:12:42] They've become one and the same thing.
[2:12:45] Even when when when when when when Adam
[2:12:47] when Adam backslided, God knew that he
[2:12:50] has backslided.
[2:12:53] He knew that he was backslid. When God
[2:12:55] is coming, he knew Adam will knew that
[2:12:59] God is coming. Then that will make you
[2:13:01] one with your creator. That will make
[2:13:03] you one with with with with with our
[2:13:06] lord.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; So the reason now for us whenever
[2:13:13] one has departed that's why we read a
[2:13:16] scripture and why do we read a
[2:13:18] scripture? We read a scripture when it
[2:13:20] speaks about the angel of the lord that
[2:13:23] is encumbered. is not talking about the
[2:13:25] second person.
[2:13:28] It's talking about you. It's talking
[2:13:29] about you, your angel. You were an angel
[2:13:32] before you became you came into this
[2:13:34] point in heaven. You're an angel. You
[2:13:37] read it. It says the throne of God is
[2:13:40] surrounded by angels, by cherabins, by
[2:13:42] saraphins, by 24 elders. See you are in
[2:13:46] heaven. The real you is the one that
[2:13:48] comes from heaven.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; But this body comes from your parents.
[2:13:53] That's right.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; There is a natural birth and there is a
[2:13:58] supernatural birth.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Now, if you are born naturally
[2:14:03] and refuse the supernatural death,
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; then you're taking a wrong direction
[2:14:09] because you were created by God. This
[2:14:11] world, this earth, planet and every
[2:14:14] flowers and every rivers and mountains
[2:14:16] and everything was created by God.
[2:14:20] It was not not created by our ancestors,
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; created by God.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; And for a reason. And he wants you
[2:14:31] to line up with him.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; When he says he's going to arrange a
[2:14:37] place, he doesn't take any Tom, dick,
[2:14:42] and hairy. No.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; No. He doesn't that he takes those that
[2:14:49] surrendered their life unto you. That's
[2:14:52] why the Bible says he that overcomes.
[2:14:55] You must tell me when it's time.
[2:14:59] It's time now. Oh, thanks.
[2:15:02] [Laughter]
[2:15:06] Okay, fine. The the
[2:15:10] ways of comfort are those.
[2:15:14] You see now my time is fito. When you
[2:15:17] see them coming,
[2:15:19] it's like when the devil coming to fetch
[2:15:21] you,
[2:15:24] you're going to say it.
[2:15:26] I don't say they devil. So I'm not
[2:15:28] saying that song, brother.
[2:15:31] So no, thank you. Let me read the last
[2:15:34] scripture then we close. I I want to
[2:15:38] explain it. It's in the second
[2:15:41] book of 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 8
[2:15:46] verse 7. It says, "But we have this
[2:15:49] treasure in an earthn vessel. The
[2:15:53] excellency of the power may be of God."
[2:15:58] In this earthn vessel, we've got a
[2:16:01] treasure. Then he goes on and say, "We
[2:16:03] are troubled on every side yet not
[2:16:06] distressed. We were perplexed but not in
[2:16:10] despair.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Persecuted but not forsaken. Cast down
[2:16:16] but not destroyed."
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Always bearing in the b in the body the
[2:16:23] dying of our Lord Jesus. that the life
[2:16:26] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[2:16:30] our
[2:16:32] may the Lord bless you.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Okay, MC
[2:16:42] [Music]
[2:16:47] words of comfort from Kosana
[2:16:51] before Mr.
[2:16:53] Loto h my elder come just to his seal up
[2:16:58] the words of kapello and then Mr. which
[2:17:01] I will take it as we'll take uh the

[2:17:14] unto us this morning. Lord God, we have

[2:17:25] the neighbors. Everybody that is here to
[2:17:29] support this heavenly father, it is
[2:17:33] because you have drawn us from different
[2:17:34] places to come here. We want to thank
[2:17:37] you Lord God because nothing has been
[2:17:39] done just habitatly. Everything has been
[2:17:42] planned by you. You prepared this. The
[2:17:44] old man is gone in peace the day his
[2:17:47] soul, spirit and the flesh depart and
[2:17:50] separate one another. We know Lord God
[2:17:53] as our brother was testifying here that
[2:17:56] already God has for ordained it.
[2:17:58] Everything just happened harmoniously
[2:18:00] and the old man has rested in peace.
[2:18:02] Thank you Lord as we'll be proceeding to
[2:18:05] the graveyard to lay his remaining.
[2:18:07] Guide us Lord God and everything should
[2:18:09] be done according to thy will as we love
[2:18:12] you and appreciate every moment in our
[2:18:14] life in the name of our Lord and Savior
[2:18:16] Jesus Christ. Amen.
