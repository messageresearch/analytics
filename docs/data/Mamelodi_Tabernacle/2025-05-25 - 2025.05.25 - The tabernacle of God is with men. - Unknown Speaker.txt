[Music] [Music] My [Music] We [Music] are since we Since we are 12 [Applause] [Music] Today I'm holy today. [Music] Holy [Music] holy Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Amen. As we bow our heads and ask pray for the reading of the word. Amen. Amen. Garden of Eden. We make a vow. Here's your before us. May your angel that always talk to us, we believe you already released that angel through our brother. Because we know the very same angel that always come here as the pastor has appointed one of our elders. I still remember when the pastor sent one of our elit. He send that angel with the am we pray in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. As we open our Bible, the book of Revelation chapter 21, we will read from verse one until 3. Revelation 21 from verse 1 to three. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God." Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Um my title this morning will be from verse three where it says the tabernacle of God is with men but we started from verse one for a good understanding. Amen. Amen. Before we start, I just received a call this morning good news from our elder that side was just telling me that they are baptizing people that area. I was very much happy because I I normally say it when you get to the area. You can baptize many people but not all we will remain. I normally say those that will remain become the base of the area upon that base others will come. So others are coming. is growing. God bless them. Amen. Amen. I remember when when we start the word of God in in said to me, the thing in Lord is the one that brought us here. So we we want it here. Amen. Amen. After we have a church there, somebody whipped me a lot like what are you trying to do? This thing is not going to work here. Then I said it's going to work. It's working because God said so. You cannot stop God. Try to fight God. You will be committing suicide. Just follow God. Amen. Amen. Where he leads me, I will not worry about the challenges of life. Brother Brenham said are there to strengthen you. When the when the wind is shaking the tree, the roots are going deeper and it becomes more strong. When the challenges of life comes your way unto the Lord because you are getting stronger. Amen. Amen. So let's get back to our title. Tabernacle of God is with me and my subtitle will be the cycle of eternity. Last few weeks I was visiting the sister churches in sharing about the word of God and then today we are here we will continue because the people that know says the history repeat itself. Amen. Amen. If there are people in the Bible that they lived a certain kind of life are here today to live like unto them. Amen. Amen. So you can do yourself a favor. Choose the character in the Bible. Amen. Amen. Brother Brenham says we live at the backside of the Bible. When the seventh seal open, when it known unto the people, the Bible becomes a new book. We can write a Bible about you. You can we can write a Bible about you because the Bible was written based on the life of the saints. If you are a saint today, you perfectly fit in the Bible. But because it's already written, you are writing a new Bible. And the Bible says we are written epistle. Amen. Amen. Well, when it says here, I saw a new heaven and a new earth. This earth, this heaven has no more. Amen. Amen. So meaning if we are on the other side, we are something and God is something because there are moment or there were moment where God was not God. He became God when he started to create. So we need to follow him as our father. We will know him better day by day. As here the Bible says in the old testament he was Jehovah. Amen looking at the nation of Israel. Brother says today he's looking at us as the bride of Jesus. So nothing has changed. is still he is still the same yesterday. I'm changing God. If someone changed is that person changing, God has never changed. Amen. Amen. That is why this cycle was always there. So I just wanted to show you the tabernacle of God is God himself. If it's God himself now that God is with me, there are moments where God is with me. And where is not with me but being something else but because we are his children we know him better seem better. Amen. Amen. And it says I, John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepare as a bride husband. He saw the new city. Amen. Amen. in that new city. God is with me. Amen. Amen. Okay. What about the other, you know, moments? Well, I'm reading brother here say God is spoken with Hebrews chapter 4. Hebrews chapter 4 paragraph 203 and 204. Amen. H and if you haven't received it, how do you if you haven't received it? How do you you can believe miracles? That takes God in you to believe God in you, not with you. The scripture we read is the tabernacle of God or God himself with me. But brother I'm saying here [Music] in a moment where God is in you where God is with you. You act like God. You know like God. You think like God. The Bible says you are amateur god little gods. Jesus said so for you are part of God. The only time where God is in mean our time during the bride. God is in me. Brother was always saved. He preached the word of God for many years. When he preached the word for many years, God was always talking to him. He was always sending an angel to him. The day he said so day I was convinced and I was happy. It was when God speak within me. [Music] Amen. Amen. Like Moses, he said, "God, you have been talking to me, but I want to see you." Brother said, "I was talking about you. Put many souls to Christ. He want to see you." When he went to see him, Paul started to talk to brother Brennan. Then he said that day I become a changed person I became something else. I started to realize that I am heavenly bound. Amen. Amen. So now for sure now you you know me practical in life we've got pragmatist theorist we've got imagin but I'm too practical than anything else I don't want to talk about the Bible not making it practical to our time we want to see ourselves in heaven. Amen. Amen. We want to see ourselves as who we are economy of God. Amen. Amen. I want to talk about our Lord Jesus Christ. You know, few characters that are too practical to put yourself in there. Amen. Amen. Meaning brother Brennham says if this Bible has been written completed and we are here our names we don't find brother in the Bible like literally written but at the back side of the Bible the Bible after the seven sins were becomes a new Bible now our names are there the Bible says Jesus Jesus Christ when he died on the cross. Amen. Amen. His soul went to hell in a prison. He preached to the Lord's soul. His spirit went back to God. His flesh was in the grave beyond death. We see those things happening. when he preached to the one that are in prison, it was not for the salvation. Now, brother says that was the faithful when you preach the message for people not to repent. Amen. That was our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, here comes Paul. Paul said I Paul has been 14 years old not telling you I was there in the third heaven when he was in the third heaven he was there and another part of him the natural part of him was here on earth but he was on the other side it shows you there when you leave there is a repres presentation for you. That is why as children of God, we don't live hapazardly. We live with a purpose. And he started to teach the people of his time about what is hell, what is heaven, where are you going when you depart? And he realized Paul again if he wishes He could have preached to his own house and let the people believe the word of God and go to heaven. But God told him there I you know I save those that I want to save. Then Paul started to realize it's not about me. When I preach hard you can preach hard it's not going to hell. He started to realize that the people saved by predestination what God has done for them who they were there save you is what saved you. Amen. Amen. You are getting saved today because you were saved. If you were not saved then you will never be saved today. We can pray for you and do everything and fast. If you were not saved, you will never be saved. So Paul was teaching that. Amen. Amen. Now comes brother Brenham and brother Brenham said, "I preach like Paul." He said it. He said it. If he preaches like Paul, Paul was the first messenger. He was the prophet. Brother, the last messenger, he was the prophet. So the first prophet and the last prophet, the first messenger and the last messenger the same message. Amen. Amen. Here brother Brenham come living an ordinary life like every one of us had challenges in life had challenges with the text man had challenges with his own family had challenges with the colleagues had challenges in the church who are you not having challenges you must have challenges in the church in your own family with your own colleagues Anywhere in life, go and read the life story of brother Bren, we are not exempted from it. God gave him an opportunity like he did to Paul. Amen. Amen. Brother Brham, God gave him an opportunity to go to the fifth dimension and he saw people there and he come back and tell us. I saw people there. They are crying and going down and down and down. And he even say the people that I saw down there, I saw them here walking. You you have a representation somewhere either your representation is in the fifth dimension or the sixth dimension. You do not just leave. You live with a purpose. You know yourself. I'm putting it practical to you. That is true. It was said by Paul. It was said by Paul. It was said by brother. Amen. Amen. If I have to follow, I will follow that kind of a character character that knows the fifth dimension and the sixth dimension. I met people Yeah. The people say other people they preach about fifth dimension, sixth dimension, we don't preach there. We are focusing on Christ. You are a liar. You can't. You can't talk about Jesus and leave the devil behind. Amen. Amen. No. Is Christ is the devil. If you don't go to Christ, you will go to the devil. If you deny Christ, you accept the devil. That's a way of life. We have representation from the fifth dimension and the sixth dimension. Amen. Amen. I was talking to the elders yesterday after the funeral day. You know when you are a child of God, don't just live a careless life. Look at where you are, where you are going because things are happening. Just us as children of God, we we know better. I said when brother Brenham go and read prophet visit South Africa when you read that spoken way. Amen. Amen. You see brotherham came here went to pritori preaching the word of God. Many people were baptized, were healed, the dead were raised. But when you trace them back, it's like they're untraceable. I even said in Deb, there were more Indians. That was 1950 something. But wait until the spoken word fell in the heart of our pastor. I have to be practical. deny that you but I said it. Amen. Amen. When the spoken word fell in the heart of our pastor changed. South Africa has changed. Africa has changed. The world has changed because God put it in a right word. You won't believe it because it's not in the Bible. But what I'm preaching about today is the backside of the Bible. Here we are today. You know, brother Brennham says, "Eaha and Eli when they walk together, Elishah benefited twice from Elijah." I said to you this morning, what God has put in our pastor is the beneficiary for us. What brother has we had it double? Yes, it's true. Amen. Amen. Can I tell you something? The message that we preached in this tabernacle is more than what has preached. Amen. Do you know this church raised the dead? Do you know this church heal the sick? If you don't know, it's not for me to let you know. Have your own experience in Christ. We write the new Bible. Here we are this morning at the backside of the Bible. Brother himself said, "Lift yourself out. Lift yourself in history. Be a present person. It's not us. Is God doing it in us today? The tabernacle of God is in men, not with men. Hallelujah. If you don't know the pastor preach the message about the underworld maybe it's no longer you know. Amen. But he preach about it. I want to tell you this. There were men and women that said they saw him as young men taking them from the underworld to life. I don't have it in the Bible but we are writing a new Bible. If you are writing a new Bible, something that you cannot read but is there a young pastor redeeming them. Can you read it in the Bible? No, you can't say back side of the Bible. You believe it or not, a man has been made to believe or not. So I said if I'm not doing it the right way, he will come and flatten it nicely. Amen. I know people in this church this morning that saw our pastor, as young as he is, not as this flesh as he is now, but a young welcoming the people in heaven. I don't read it in the Bible here saying they saw him ushering them. Welcome brothers. Welcome for this is your home. I want to show you one thing this morning. Don't look at a person on this flesh lost. But we have the representation in heaven. That is the one that is communicating with us. That is the one that is the part of God. This one is the part of this flesh, this earth. It was born here. It will end here. But we have something that was not born of a man and a woman is the one that welcome us. Amen. Brothers and sisters, I'm a practical man. If if you tell me something, make sure you you make me understand. But if you know when we at school, we've got theorist people. Hey, I remember one day while they were still teaching us at they were teaching me 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 until 19 then I understand then 21 I said that means 20 and then we enter that is 21. That is 20 and one. Where are you coming from? That is not 21. I said 21. That is 201. But to me it was 20 plus. Maybe that's why I'm too practical because the teacher tried to con today I just accept because 2012 I had a tough time x * x is x where am I'm going to apply this in life square root of x that was for but I I pass my math and science in school. Some you do not understand, you just say because they teach you, you understand them, you go them with life. Amen. You need to know the time you are living in. The time you are living in is the tabernacle of God in not with men, but in the new city. is the tabernacle of God made. Why? Because in the new city, the lamp is the light. We saw him as the lamp there. As the light there, we are here as the bride is with us. Amen. Amen. That is why we see the new heaven, the new earth because the first one is gone. Amen. On the other side, it's him and us. Here, him in us. When you walk is him walking. Amen. Amen. As I was saying yesterday with the brothers, we are we can talk the family. Always when I look at the pastor, I likened him to David in the Bible. But I said until I read the story of John in Patmos vision, my mind changed. You know the way I see because John Bar was the last who lived long all of them and as old as he was stand behind the pool and teach the church where whenever he wish so go and read the life of John the re the the revelator What revelation? Amen. And look at the life of your pastor. You will come and tell me something. I like to follow, observe and you know. Yeah. Amen. Go. I challenge you. Go and read that. Amen. Amen. You know the the word of God is not in our mind. It's in our heart. Jesus Christ go to Jerusalem looking at Jerusalem prophesy about him. Automatically the young man the young woman put the leaves on the ropes for him to pass saying the king of glory who touched them there. No one else but God that was in them. them. Do it today. God that is in you will tell you do it. Amen. Amen. Amen. You need to know the time we're living in. You know Moses, the story of Moses. And let's maybe let this the scripture because we are in the church. Amen. Exodus chapter um No, no, no. Let's leave that one. I'll show you this one. Exodus chapter 13. Yeah. Verse 21. Verse 21. And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night. Amen. Amen. Read this one as well. Uh Exodia chapter 17. Exodus 17. Verse 11 to 13. Verse 11-13. And it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed. And when he let down his hands, Amalcch prevailed. But Moses' hands were heavy. And they took a stone and put it under him. And he sat there on. And Aaron and her stayed up his hands. and one of the and one on the one side and the other on the other side. And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. And Joshua discon disconed Amalecch and his people with the edge of the sword. Amen. Why I read those two two scriptures? I want to show you that there in 13:21 the Bible says God he went before them of cloud at night a pillar of that is the only way and only way how God communicated with God shows that is with them. He was above them. The cloud is up there. It was God. Amen. Amen. So the children of Israel when they see the cloud, they start to to have joy. He's with us. He's above us. When they see that pillar of fire during the the the night, the cloud by day is a confirmation that God is there for them. The very same pillar of fire, the very same cloud is the one that killed Egyptian but saved the Israelites. The word of God I preached this morning is the very same way that can save you. That is the very same way that can kill someone. The word of God, it kills and it can also save. Amen. Amen. That is the word of God. It bring separation. The word of God bring separation. The gold and the sheep they they separate from the same crop. It it has started in heaven. It's now in earth. The war of the angel in the war of the people because in heaven we are angels. Here we are flesh but we are the same person. Amen. Amen. It came to pass when Moses held up his hand. Israel prevail when he let them down the Amalcch prevail. Now what is the plan now? Let's make sure Moses hands are always up so that we can prevail because when they come down they get defeat. we get defeated. They came up with that plan. Amen. Amen. They put the stone and put them up. When they up there, Joshua defeated the Amalcch. [Music] Amen. Amen. One can say they could have prayed. They could have done them and but God said just lift up Moses. When you lift them up, you shall prevail. Hallelujah. Amen. Same thing even today. As long as there's a breath of life in our pastor's lungs, we shall lift his hands up. So we prevail with Moses with John the Revelator and is us today. Same pattern because God is unchanging God in our time is God in us. That thing will happen automatically. Amen. Amen. When you drive an automatic car, you don't have to worry. It just change itself with a step heel change itself. You just enjoying. Amen. Amen. If it's manual, we have problems here. I'm not saying you shouldn't buy manual cars. But the intake is not the same. Start hating me from today. He's talking about but just the other day. I think I'm talking to the mature church. Amen. Amen. So God in that time he was revolving around the leadership. that he put in Moses the daughter will come. But if they can defeat Moses, they have defeated God. Can they never happen? That is why Joshua killed the Amalachites because he respected the leadership of Moses by just lifting his hand up. When I was reading the life story of John of Revelation, he was eyes. They boil him with oil 24 hours and then they released him and he went to Ephes and he became the sear in the church of Ephes. He was old at the age of 93 but he could he could speak to the church for 10 minutes. When they leave they are blessed but other preachers come and preach for 4 hours. When Congress leave, everybody's angry. Yeah. I'm sorry for that. 3:1 16 verse 16. Yes. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you? Amen. It's a question unto you that don't you know that you are the temple of God dwelling place of God. Whatever you are doing, whatever you go through I I don't know how to express this one. You know in life we have challenges. We have anxiety, depression, this and that. We cry, we do this, we can try there, but it's us as people. If we come to a realization that the creator of is in us, you will relax and let he do everything in you. Talk about it here. He says is God working in you God talking in you. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. That's what brother is saying because we worry a lot about these things of the world and they have hold us until we cannot see that the creator of heaven and earth in us. This day we are living in God is in us. God is with us will be in the new sea. Where will be his bride? Amen. Amen. I I gave the example last day and say your your nature if your nature is the nature of God, you will have the nature of God and it will remain like that. So I was telling them the story about the baboon and the snake. They had agreement that baboon should help the snake. You understand? So the snake was helping baboon to cross the tar road because it was too hot. Then the baboon said no man. It can't be use snake. You like biting people in animals. He said those are the anti-vilian snakes. But the modern snake, there are two democrats. I am a democrat. I love people. I love baboon. I love other animals. And then the baboon says, hallelujah. Then the baboon carried a snake. They crossed the road. They went for for for hunting then they come back. When they come back now is the time and the time is now. And he bite the baboon. Baboon was like what do you think? Snake is his name. My nature is to bite and I'm biting you. You can do whatever. Yes, other people can hide their character for far too long. They fight because our nature never started here. I just forgot this this this president from Africa somewhere. I I just forgot his name. But he's an old man. He just love laughing. We can laugh and tell the people good things when when they want to get those things. He will laugh and say, "What do you think?" Politic is politic. You cannot be an honest politician. He's a he's an old man. I just I forgot his name, but others may know him. He tells you the nature of a politician. Amen. A nature of a baboon and the nature of the snake are not the same. The snake was made to bite the Amen. Amen. Then from that time knew that I did not trust the snakes. Amen. Any people in life we can go together somewhere somehow one will say I didn't know you are like this yeah the Bible says in Revelation 12 when there was a war we didn't know that Lucifer Lucifer I show my color. Let's read from the spoken word. Amen. Adoption. Amen. Amen. Part four. It says, "And now paragraph 76." This may just choke you to death, but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur? How many ever noted? How many knows that Jesus said so? Bible Jesus said, "Did not your law say itself that you are God?" And if you call them God, which God said in Genesis chapter 2, that they were gods. They they had full domain over the dominion of the world. He gave him dominion. over all things. Amen. Amen. God gave a man the dominion of all things. God wanted a man to be God because he wanted to indwell himself in a man. The years passed by. The Old Testament passed by. The New Testament passed by. We see that happening today. God in a man. Amen. Amen. There was never a time like ours. During the time of Jesus Christ, it was God with them. God in Jesus Christ ate with them, sail with them, do everything with them. Amen. Amen. Jesus Christ, he came here to taste death so that we may not be fear of death. He became the wavy sea. Amen. That is why today we don't fear death. No, don't fear death. You fear death. It catches you. Why should you fear when you die? I always say it's my motto of life. There is nothing and nothing that can happen to me without God not knowing about it. Maybe some of the things I should ask a permission from the pastor to to say them because in a mixed multitude maybe it's not well but go and read the life story of brother check what kind of challenges he had in life and you the challenges of life. Tell me the difference. Amen. Amen. There's no difference and go and check how overcame. Brother was scared of text man. If you even dream about them just to give you one but there are too many but in the sixth dimension you will go through those six dimensions dimension. Amen. Amen. Let me know. Amen. And he lost his god sheep. He lost his son sheep. He lost his domain and Satan took it over and he started to control the will. Amen. But brother, we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again. Hallelujah. Amen. Waiting for the fullness of time. When the pyramid gets up to the top, when the four sons of God will come manifested, when the power of God will walk out. Hallelujah. Amen. And we take every power away from him. Yes, sir. It belongs to him. Amen. Amen. I want to ask you a question. Are you still looking for that time brother is talking about? If you are still looking for that time Calvary is still far from it. But I want to tell you this morning that time is this time. The manifestation of is today. We have power over Satan because the one who created heaven and earth is not with us above us in us. He is the one that defeat the devil. He was the one who defeated the devil. If he defeated the devil and is in me, I will defeat the devil. And it's not me defeating the devil. It's him defeating the devil through me. He just used my body. Amen. Amen. If you can have that, you are more than a conqueror. We we mustn't just singer. Be that. Amen. In heaven, we were conquerors. On earth, we are more than conquerors. Amen. Because a man where in the flesh was born in sin iniquity, God is in him becomes more than a conqueror. Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother Brenham. when he grew up he experienced what we are experiencing. Amen. Amen. He passed through the adolescent state when the girls and the boys were laughing at him. Amen. Amen. Then he wanted to be like them. But God said to him, "Don't smoke. Don't drink. Don't defile your body. Then he said yes God. But when God leave he follow them. Then God come not with you because I have a work for you. Same thing today through with you. That is why I'm saying some I cannot say but go and live the life story about the family life of brother because somewhere somehow saying get into my house from work my wife was not okay my kids were not okay everybody was crying just confusion in the house I didn't know where to start I He wanted to go back to come back when things are okay. But God said to him, I you have the power as a man to fix this situation. God was talking to brother Brenam. Yes, you have the power. You are not going to run away, face this music. Oh, brother was just singing maybe there. Amen. You know, must Jesus bear the cross. He said, "Brother Brenham, I started washing the dishes in the apron. Washing the dishes, singing and praying in my heart. I will look at my wife. I look at my kids. I will continue when I look back and see the smiley face on my wife. I thank God because I had the power to fix the situation. [Applause] Many many today one day they they they ask me to speak in a wedding of one of our colleagues. When I speak I said to I know you drink. One day you'll come to the house things are not okay. I don't want to hear for after things are not obtained you went back to the nearest create the situation because if you go back and come back they will still be the same don't run away from the problem fix the problem I'm saying this because many people run away and they find a solution as the divorce. I'm sorry brothers and sisters. Some of the things you must not talk about. Yes. I I was just passing trying to show how responsible should we be. I just passed by Even if he can stand here for 10 minutes, that 10 minutes will sustain you to eternity. [Applause] Amen. Amen. The feast of the trumpet spoken with fist of the trumpet. Paragraph 43. Paragraph 43. Brother Brenham safe immediately after that meaning after he met the angel comes because my 45 minutes is gone. The angels of the Lord appeared and told me about the seven or the seventh seal that I was returned back here to Jefferson and preach the seventh seal. Amen. Amen. When you read the Bible, I even found this question in the YouTube people discussing who brother Brandham think he is because the Bible says the lamb that was with him was the only one to open the seals for. But on a Sunday morning, brother stood there and said to the church, I am here this morning to open the seals of God. God left heaven, came here on earth, incarnate himself in Bren and opened the sea. a time we are living in the tabernacle of God. If you think I'm preaching, I'm not preaching. Is God preaching using my [Applause] body? The glory shall go to God. Amen. Amen. There were the angels of the Lord met us and the Bible becomes a new Bible. This Bible becomes a new Bible. We can close it. When the squeeze comes if they take the Bible, don't worry. This Bible is in you. You write a new Bible. God bless you all. Amen. Let's stand to our feet and praise God. Amen. Amen.
