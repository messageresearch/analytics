[12:45] will this be the last time
[12:55] we will still meet
[12:58] but the science
[13:02] convinced us that this is the end of
[13:06] time
[13:09] amen
[13:10] by the children of God
[13:13] we have the children of God are
[13:15] rejoicing
[13:18] because
[13:19] we are nearing homes
[13:26] is the migration
[13:29] the Seed of Abraham
[13:35] we've been longing to go home
[13:40] for a long time okay
[13:45] so we'll
[13:47] we have arrived we are
[13:49] here
[13:53] as we say
[13:55] it is a rupturing
[13:58] without death
[14:03] let me quote it here by there
[14:07] prophet
[14:10] that is
[14:12] the Rapture page 20.
[14:17] paragraph 105.
[14:25] um there's a brother of mine
[14:29] who has sent a message to another
[14:32] brother in the church
[14:38] and they said tell uh brother godima
[14:45] and
[14:46] he loves to call me
[14:49] the Ancient One
[14:54] I don't know that's the brother not me
[14:58] now he said tell brother that
[15:06] this is the last mile of the way
[15:15] all right
[15:18] let me quote the prophet
[15:21] now we find
[15:24] here that Enoch was the seventh from
[15:29] from
[15:34] Adam
[15:36] which was a type of the church ages
[15:44] all of the rest of the six men before
[15:47] him died
[15:49] foreign
[16:04] [Applause]
[16:23] the servants Church age that
[16:26] takes the rapture
[16:31] and now there's no doubt
[16:35] we are in the seventh Church age
[16:40] we all know it
[16:43] now is the seventh Church age that takes
[16:46] the rapture
[16:52] all of the other
[16:56] six
[16:57] six died
[16:59] he's talking about the church ages
[17:03] foreign
[17:17] because he was not found he was not
[17:20] found God
[17:24] took him
[17:28] but Enoch
[17:31] Rapture was a type of all the rest of
[17:36] them
[17:43] now let's
[17:45] take this one
[17:47] the end time bride
[17:50] will be called out
[17:55] then he says out off
[17:59] then he says the rupturing without death
[18:10] that's referring to as the the remaining
[18:14] here
[18:15] foreign
[18:18] will be
[18:22] will be called out
[18:25] the seventh Church age
[18:32] which we are now bearing record of that
[18:35] age
[18:40] then he says my
[18:46] let's dig in now real deep please
[18:51] yeah I love this
[18:54] prophet of flowers
[18:57] Okay so
[19:01] he walked with God
[19:08] I believe we are also now working with
[19:12] God
[19:14] [Applause]
[19:15] [Music]
[19:18] and
[19:19] he says
[19:26] meaning he walked with God
[19:30] that is rapturing
[19:34] [Applause]
[19:36] foreign
[19:42] spoke of the rupturing faith
[19:50] I said to the children of God one day
[19:56] that we realize we are on the
[20:00] Runway
[20:04] you know the flight before it takes off
[20:09] it has to run away
[20:17] now
[20:19] I don't know we all believe that
[20:24] the bride of Christ is now on a Runway
[20:29] [Applause]
[20:31] before they take their flight
[20:36] very soon
[20:40] now
[20:43] Enoch
[20:44] the seventh man
[20:50] and the prophet says if you count days
[20:56] you count seven
[21:02] then after counting seven
[21:08] he says then what
[21:11] you come to eight
[21:14] now eighties
[21:16] going back
[21:20] you count that's why he says there's the
[21:23] seventh man the seventh Church age
[21:27] he says this seventh Church age
[21:32] is typed with Enoch
[21:37] he types it with Enoch
[21:40] we are in the seventh churches
[21:44] we all know it is the seven that takes
[21:48] the rapture
[21:52] so that means
[21:54] we are in the seventh Church
[22:00] and this is the seventh that takes the
[22:03] rapture
[22:05] [Music]
[22:07] amen
[22:10] in the book of
[22:13] this is the future home
[22:17] [Music]
[22:20] one of the great books
[22:25] by our Prophet yeah
[22:27] [Music]
[22:29] a future home of the
[22:32] heavenly
[22:34] bridegroom and the Earthly bridge
[22:41] I will look at this
[22:43] page and
[22:50] may the Lord bless you
[22:56] I'm looking at page 31 here
[23:04] and
[23:11] sentences
[23:17] the eighth
[23:21] cannot be countered with
[23:23] the week
[23:26] [Music]
[23:30] meaning cannot be counted with the seven
[23:37] and we lived through these types
[23:40] [Music]
[23:43] but when you hit the Earth
[23:49] you go into
[23:51] eternity
[23:55] some people
[23:57] think that eternity that's when we die
[24:02] and we enter eternity
[24:06] but the Bible says if we believe in you
[24:10] we have eternal life
[24:14] [Applause]
[24:17] I'm not waiting for
[24:20] for my death
[24:24] YouTube
[24:30] the rapture
[24:34] in this seventh
[24:36] uh Church age
[24:39] we we are the last year
[24:42] [Music]
[24:44] the seventh Church age
[24:48] now according to the prophet yes
[24:51] we are not waiting for death
[24:55] we are waiting for the rapture
[25:00] he says he's the Rapture rapturing
[25:03] without death
[25:07] meaning working with him with God
[25:12] [Music]
[25:13] [Applause]
[25:17] we will walk with God
[25:21] like a Enoch
[25:24] he walked this God
[25:26] and he was not
[25:29] [Applause]
[25:32] that is the love of God
[25:35] with God
[25:36] and he was not
[25:39] foreign
[25:49] [Applause]
[26:02] because we are already ruptured
[26:11] then uh here we are
[26:14] we we are that's page 30.
[26:20] we are entering into that area genuine
[26:26] eternity
[26:32] it doesn't say we are going to enter
[26:34] into
[26:35] but we we are entering
[26:40] where the church is called not to some
[26:42] station
[26:47] or some denomination
[26:52] but into eternity
[26:56] with their Eternal King
[27:00] the church is called into eternity
[27:06] so we're here to represent all the
[27:08] church ages
[27:12] because
[27:13] we are the last
[27:19] do you know that we are the last
[27:22] [Applause]
[27:24] after us there's no more
[27:28] there's no age
[27:32] we are closing
[27:35] [Applause]
[27:38] so it says
[27:42] where the church is called not to some
[27:44] station
[27:47] [Music]
[27:48] but into eternity
[27:52] Eternal King
[27:56] and now you've passed into eternity
[28:02] where you come from
[28:07] okay
[28:10] as I say
[28:12] I spoke to a brother from
[28:18] Australia
[28:21] is one of our brothers from Australia
[28:27] and
[28:29] he has reminded me that we are or will
[28:33] all meet over there
[28:40] he also believed our journey is finished
[28:45] [Applause]
[28:48] our past
[28:49] into eternity where you come from
[28:58] if you come from eternity
[29:02] then the prophet says yes you have
[29:05] passed into
[29:07] eternity
[29:09] where you come from
[29:12] foreign
[29:13] [Applause]
[29:19] that this
[29:21] part of Ephesians
[29:26] is that Ephesians chapter
[29:29] one I think
[29:31] I believe
[29:36] if you find Ephesians
[29:40] chapter one
[29:44] now now we are talking about
[29:47] yeah
[29:49] eternity
[29:51] [Music]
[29:52] and Ephesians
[29:57] this
[29:58] uh
[30:00] [Music]
[30:05] having made known unto us the mystery of
[30:08] his will according to his good pleasure
[30:11] which he has proposed in himself
[30:14] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[30:17] of times he might gather together in one
[30:21] all things in Christ both which are in
[30:24] heaven and which are on earth even in
[30:27] him amen
[30:49] did you hear the scripture
[30:51] that in the dispensations of the
[30:54] fullness of times
[30:58] he might gather together
[31:03] in one
[31:06] all things in Christ
[31:09] both which are in heaven
[31:13] and which are on earth
[31:17] even in him
[31:21] now I read this picture 31.
[31:25] foreign
[31:31] into that real genuine eternity
[31:37] [Music]
[31:39] as the church is not called to a
[31:41] denomination or to some station
[31:50] then he says you've passed into eternity
[31:56] where you come from
[32:01] that's your destination
[32:05] that's where you come from
[32:10] [Music]
[32:11] if you've got eternal life
[32:14] there is only one form
[32:18] that's God
[32:22] and you are an expressed attribute
[32:29] not just an attribute but an expressed
[32:36] attribute
[32:40] then he says then you are in eternity
[32:46] where you was all the time
[32:53] meaning you've never left eternity
[32:57] you have never left
[33:01] he says you you have all the time
[33:06] [Music]
[33:08] but you've just recognized
[33:14] you were made for an eternal peoples
[33:20] that's why you can't sin
[33:25] you can go back to the world
[33:28] because you are made for an eternal
[33:31] purpose
[33:36] is in your mind
[33:38] is only thinking of about eternity
[33:45] I mean because he was the manifestation
[33:50] of an attribute
[33:55] in God
[33:57] you know it was in God
[34:02] and then now you are a manifestation
[34:07] and from God
[34:10] from the mind of God
[34:14] you are attributes
[34:18] to manifest
[34:20] the mind of God
[34:24] amen
[34:28] your neighbors
[34:31] are depending on you
[34:36] because
[34:37] you are a manifestation
[34:42] of the mind yeah
[34:45] of God
[34:50] of all what God thought you will be you
[34:53] are
[34:54] foreign
[34:59] [Applause]
[35:20] God said
[35:22] let there be light
[35:27] and he says and there was no light until
[35:31] that weight was manifested
[35:38] The Light Came as a manifestation
[35:43] yes pastor
[35:46] so now
[35:47] you have but I I could you know then you
[35:52] are in eternity
[35:56] where you was all the time okay
[36:03] now if you are in eternity
[36:06] you will believe that you are in Italian
[36:09] amen
[36:11] [Applause]
[36:13] your faith
[36:15] will manifested
[36:19] as you were made
[36:22] for an eternal peoples
[36:31] meaning when I look at you
[36:37] I see you from
[36:39] the time
[36:42] to the end
[36:45] you know if you look at the Christian
[36:48] you are looking at an eternal being
[36:56] [Music]
[36:57] oh my god when preaching to this eternal
[37:01] beings
[37:04] you don't you don't think
[37:09] of saying of seeing them
[37:14] leaving the church or living the faith
[37:19] foreign
[37:29] [Applause]
[37:35] you know in the world there's some
[37:38] people
[37:40] if you look at them you can say will
[37:44] this one last the peace
[37:48] amen but if you look at a predestinated
[37:52] seed
[37:56] because you are the children you are not
[37:59] the children you are the Seed of Abraham
[38:04] [Applause]
[38:07] so now it says here
[38:10] and
[38:13] you
[38:16] that that thought of you
[38:20] and okay let me take it from here
[38:24] the manifestation of an attribute
[38:30] oh God
[38:37] expressed you
[38:42] know
[38:44] God trusts his thoughts so much
[38:50] he even expressed
[38:53] his thoughts knowing that his thoughts
[38:56] will never fail
[39:00] he expressed them
[39:03] and and here you are
[39:07] an Express the thought of God
[39:14] how can you expect a falling away
[39:19] as you are looking at an eternal being
[39:28] no it says
[39:31] he made
[39:34] us to to take you out
[39:39] all right make you he make you a human
[39:43] being
[39:48] and sin
[39:50] come along and perverted his way
[39:57] but you
[39:59] you was lost
[40:01] with the world so he come and redeemed
[40:06] you
[40:10] as you remember we were Redeemed by
[40:13] the family
[40:18] Redeemed by the blood of a relative
[40:22] [Applause]
[40:26] you the express attribute
[40:30] not just an attribute but an expressed
[40:38] and also
[40:40] redeems this Earth by the same way
[40:45] his purpose rolls on purpose
[40:48] [Music]
[40:50] now I read this part here
[40:54] now in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 10.
[41:00] you are putting it down
[41:03] it's called not a dispensation
[41:07] not the seventh day
[41:10] is called the fullness of time
[41:17] and when the fullness of time has come
[41:22] that's when time has
[41:24] been fulfilled
[41:27] [Music]
[41:29] did you know that seven churches speaks
[41:33] of times
[41:36] seven series speaks of Italian
[41:42] okay
[41:44] when the fullness of time
[41:48] has come
[41:50] that's when time has been fulfilled
[41:57] okay
[42:00] that's why we are thinking of nothing
[42:04] but we are our mind now
[42:09] ball
[42:10] who is flooded with some
[42:13] thoughts
[42:17] for the rapture
[42:21] because we are in their seventh Church
[42:23] age
[42:27] as brother Brennan says
[42:30] all the others
[42:33] are now in the sixth Dimension
[42:36] we are the last year
[42:38] [Music]
[42:41] Okay so
[42:43] I will finish this
[42:46] the fullness of time
[42:49] [Music]
[42:52] now when
[42:54] you no more the fullness of time and
[42:58] when the fullness of time has come
[43:03] that's when time has been fulfilled
[43:09] when there is no more time
[43:13] again
[43:14] as you know in the Book of Revelation it
[43:17] says
[43:18] and their time shall be
[43:22] no more
[43:23] yeah yes I know my body is time now we
[43:29] want
[43:30] now when you go into eternity
[43:34] after the seven Church ages
[43:40] have you heard this one

[43:50] and it is
[43:53] [Music]
[43:54] [Applause]

[44:07] Eternity or getting into eternity
[44:12] at a certain time
[44:16] that is coming
[44:20] but according to the word
[44:24] we have already entered
[44:28] [Applause]
[44:31] now a person who has entered eternity
[44:34] okay
[44:35] you can even see him by his works
[44:41] [Music]
[44:43] he cannot go back
[44:48] he's not a person who's going back come
[44:50] back with him
[44:54] confess and next time no that is not
[44:57] eternity a person who has eternal life
[45:01] the Bible says you cannot sin
[45:08] because we are born of God
[45:12] the Bible says he that is born of God
[45:16] cannot
[45:22] see if you know the word cannot
[45:27] why why
[45:30] because God don't tame us
[45:35] we are born
[45:39] if you are born an African then you are
[45:42] an African
[45:45] if you are born of God says
[45:53] foreign
[45:58] [Applause]
[46:01] from the book of adoption
[46:07] when brother Brennan says
[46:10] we are a match of God
[46:15] and I was hammered for that
[46:21] says we are God
[46:30] in our image
[46:36] God wanted to make you
[46:44] brother brother
[46:48] in creation
[46:52] when God arrived here at the men
[46:57] he saw that in that man
[47:01] it looked like him
[47:05] I don't have the book to read to you now
[47:09] amen
[47:12] when he was doing his rounds
[47:17] when he arrived at the mail
[47:21] God said
[47:24] the prophet says
[47:27] then he saw that in that manner
[47:31] it looked like him
[47:36] because he said let us make men in our
[47:42] image
[47:43] [Applause]
[47:46] that was the purpose
[47:53] and then
[47:55] it's this now
[47:59] when there is no more time
[48:04] when you go into eternity
[48:10] somebody's thinking of after death
[48:15] no we are not talking about
[48:17] we are talking about when you enter into
[48:23] eternity
[48:25] after the seventh Church age
[48:27] [Music]
[48:29] is over
[48:32] and
[48:33] it is
[48:38] okay so that's why we are not in the
[48:41] church ages
[48:47] Luther's age is over
[48:49] Methodist church is
[48:53] over
[48:55] Pentecostal age is over

[49:46] actually it's not Pentacles
[49:50] it's a denomination
[49:53] amen with the name Pentecost
[50:01] you know the real Church
[50:03] was started by the
[50:06] the real church is the blood of the Lamb
[50:12] [Applause]
[50:17] God bless you my brother
[50:21] hey I remember I look for a quotation
[50:24] sometimes
[50:26] I was in Swaziland
[50:30] and
[50:33] one of our brothers a brother from
[50:35] Alabama
[50:37] was it from Alabama

[50:52] but been there in Florida
[50:56] where others one is from Alabama the
[51:00] others of Australia and so

[51:11] now today you won't find that Pentecost
[51:15] [Music]
[51:19] you know as I'm saying
[51:24] people come together
[51:27] and say
[51:29] we want to start a movement
[51:32] for God
[51:36] can you no
[51:39] you can't start a church
[51:43] you don't have that blood to start the
[51:46] church
[51:50] it took the blood
[51:55] of God to build a church
[52:00] foreign
[52:01] not human blood
[52:06] brother we want to start them a new
[52:09] movement
[52:11] a new change
[52:13] yeah it's a new church but but this is
[52:15] human change
[52:20] foreign
[52:33] [Applause]
[52:35] okay now
[52:37] that's why
[52:40] let me finish to run it here
[52:44] there's something
[52:45] Church age
[52:48] is over
[52:49] when it is over
[52:52] and it is
[52:55] Luther's age is over
[52:59] and so

[53:09] you are reciting in the ruins of that
[53:12] something
[53:20] maybe you didn't hear it
[53:24] he says if he says
[53:27] method this age is over
[53:30] [Music]
[53:33] it means what is left is the ruins
[53:39] the rain
[53:45] you know if you leave your house
[53:49] you are going to start somewhere else
[53:54] what remains in that house will be the
[53:57] beds flying

[54:01] and so forth
[54:04] is open to everything that cannot
[54:09] oh Lord buy a house
[54:13] okay
[54:20] now if God has left
[54:25] the place only Birds

[54:45] eternity no more servants
[54:48] me no more threes

[56:35] uh
[56:37] the prophet speaks here of
[56:40] Revelation chapter 4 verse 1.

[1:02:49] Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from
[1:02:52] God hey wonderful
[1:02:55] come and see the bridge
[1:02:58] then he saw a great City
[1:03:02] because brother Branham says
[1:03:05] bright is like Jerusalem
[1:03:09] it is built like the New Jerusalem
[1:03:13] you see the pyramid form
[1:03:17] that's why uh
[1:03:19] if you follow
[1:03:22] okay of course the message you don't
[1:03:25] follow because it is in you
[1:03:31] the people who follow sometimes they
[1:03:33] trip
[1:03:37] okay now
[1:03:39] he says the pride is built like the city
[1:03:45] of Jerusalem
[1:03:49] now they take the seat of Jerusalem
[1:03:52] if you read this book it's exactly like
[1:03:57] the pyramid
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:01] and the top there
[1:04:03] is light
[1:04:07] the light will stop there
[1:04:10] and the bright there
[1:04:13] is
[1:04:15] she's a queen
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:22] now
[1:04:25] you see if you find the children of God
[1:04:28] there
[1:04:30] foreign
[1:04:40] they can't sing because
[1:04:46] on the other side she's a queen
[1:04:51] the Bride is a queen
[1:04:57] have you seen the Menace of a queen
[1:05:06] the Menace of a queen
[1:05:11] now I read this part here
[1:05:16] my brother just offered me this one
[1:05:19] that in creation I must read it he
[1:05:23] offered to me
[1:05:25] God bless you sir
[1:05:31] complete creation
[1:05:35] he says when God was waking this the
[1:05:38] Masterpiece page 10 here
[1:05:51] we were
[1:05:55] that was a complete creation
[1:05:59] God working in a pattern
[1:06:04] but finally
[1:06:06] they came forth upon the earth a
[1:06:09] perfection
[1:06:14] and that was a man
[1:06:20] okay
[1:06:24] just go and
[1:06:26] read it
[1:06:30] the master peace
[1:06:34] it will tell you that
[1:06:40] finally they came upon the earth a
[1:06:44] perfection
[1:06:49] because God said let us make men in our
[1:06:57] that's why the prophet calls it a
[1:06:59] perfection
[1:07:02] and that was a man
[1:07:06] then he could see in that man
[1:07:18] you know Adam
[1:07:20] was like God's mirror
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:25] for God wanted to see himself
[1:07:33] when he looks at you
[1:07:35] he should see himself
[1:07:40] that's why he has planned you in that
[1:07:43] way
[1:07:45] let us make men
[1:07:47] in our image
[1:07:52] so that if we wanted to see ourselves
[1:07:56] we shall look at the man
[1:08:00] because he's in our image
[1:08:03] he is our mirror
[1:08:06] that's why later when Adam has sinned
[1:08:11] god king
[1:08:14] calling out
[1:08:16] Adam Adam where are you
[1:08:19] God couldn't see himself
[1:08:23] the mirror was no longer dead
[1:08:29] so he was looking for the mirror
[1:08:32] and the mirror was not there
[1:08:35] so he asked
[1:08:36] Mira
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:43] said I have sinned
[1:08:46] I have seen
[1:08:48] then the mirror knew that
[1:08:50] after singing
[1:08:53] it can no longer reflect it
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:08:58] dead
[1:08:59] the Creator
[1:09:04] that's why a person after your sin is
[1:09:09] running
[1:09:11] it's just running
[1:09:15] even when you meet him on the street
[1:09:20] there was one brother
[1:09:25] he has left the church there in
[1:09:27] mpumalanga side
[1:09:31] now it was no longer coming to church
[1:09:36] now every time we meet somebody from the
[1:09:40] church oh how are you my brother yeah
[1:09:43] how's the pastor
[1:09:45] you know the pastor is fine God gave me
[1:09:48] give him this twenty dollars
[1:09:51] I will come to church
[1:09:57] yeah
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:09:59] the pastor was receiving 20 dollars
[1:10:04] ten dollars and so forth
[1:10:06] but the Pastor said no I don't want 20
[1:10:09] dollars
[1:10:13] [Applause]
[1:10:18] okay
[1:10:20] now here it is
[1:10:22] and when
[1:10:24] and
[1:10:26] then he could see in that man
[1:10:33] now we are getting the right picture
[1:10:38] not he could see that man foreign
[1:10:47] [Applause]
[1:11:06] [Applause]
[1:11:08] God had now been able to achieve
[1:11:13] the thing that he wanted
[1:11:17] a man in his own image
[1:11:21] that is God's achievement
[1:11:25] Amen in his
[1:11:28] image
[1:11:33] God wants to see himself
[1:11:37] in you that's why he said let us make
[1:11:41] men in our image
[1:11:48] you see
[1:11:52] I think all of us here
[1:11:54] we understand that God wants to see
[1:11:58] himself in US
[1:12:03] [Applause]
[1:12:06] we are only few amazing
[1:12:14] okay let me try again
[1:12:17] God wants to see himself
[1:12:22] in US
[1:12:25] [Applause]
[1:12:28] all right
[1:12:30] it shows that we are online
[1:12:35] that is God's achievement
[1:12:39] he wanted
[1:12:41] a man in his own image
[1:12:50] this message is rich
[1:12:56] okay
[1:12:58] now we read
[1:13:01] 70s
[1:13:03] only has to do with the old creation
[1:13:06] that is page 28 future home
[1:13:18] then page 29 he continues here
[1:13:22] seven days watch

[1:14:08] now this is
[1:14:10] we are the last people
[1:14:14] the others are already in the sixth
[1:14:17] dimension

[1:14:24] who will be taken up in the Rapture
[1:14:28] without death
[1:14:32] amen
[1:14:36] and
[1:14:37] I don't need to count how many believe
[1:14:40] this

[1:15:25] he said
[1:15:28] and that is
[1:15:30] the age
[1:15:31] that takes the rapture
[1:15:39] but now
[1:15:42] we believe that
[1:15:44] we are here on the runway
[1:15:48] oh yeah
[1:15:54] then I'll find this scripture here
[1:15:59] okay let's take Elijah
[1:16:05] and this other one you say is
[1:16:09] you say Elisha or Elisha Elisha or
[1:16:12] Elisha just like that

[1:16:27] is it Second Kings
[1:16:31] right chapter 2.
[1:16:41] before closing
[1:16:46] without
[1:16:51] death yeah
[1:16:55] okay
[1:16:59] if I happen to
[1:17:01] pass on

[1:17:13] will still be saying
[1:17:16] rapturing without faith

[1:17:26] brother so and so
[1:17:29] has passed on I was even at this funeral
[1:17:34] I will be preaching that this is this
[1:17:39] age
[1:17:40] we are the last people
[1:17:44] to be raptured without death
[1:17:53] okay
[1:17:55] now here is
[1:17:58] Elisha
[1:18:02] one day Elijah
[1:18:04] also started
[1:18:09] he started on a Runway
[1:18:16] there was an Uber coming for him
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:28] then
[1:18:31] he knew that there's a chariot that is
[1:18:34] coming
[1:18:37] then just as we know that there's a
[1:18:39] rapture
[1:18:46] I'm listening to the pastor Pastor
[1:18:49] seizure saying
[1:18:52] we don't know whether this is the last
[1:18:54] meeting
[1:18:59] he knows that there is rapture
[1:19:05] [Applause]
[1:19:07] we don't know when but it is just here
[1:19:14] all right now this man
[1:19:17] the Bible says it came to pass
[1:19:22] when the Lord would take Elijah into
[1:19:26] Heaven by a ruined
[1:19:32] that Elijah went with Elisha
[1:19:42] he knew
[1:19:44] that he was going to be taken away
[1:19:50] but of course
[1:19:52] he had to
[1:19:55] to start working towards that
[1:20:02] you are working towards the rapture
[1:20:06] trying to do everything right
[1:20:11] amen trying to get right with God
[1:20:19] you know that it is
[1:20:28] preparing yourself
[1:20:30] because you know that the Rapture is
[1:20:34] coming
[1:20:37] um
[1:20:39] Elijah knew it
[1:20:42] that the Chariot
[1:20:44] [Applause]
[1:20:46] now he took Elijah
[1:20:54] then and it says and Elijah said unto
[1:20:57] Elisha
[1:21:00] Terry here I pray thee for the Lord hath
[1:21:03] sent me to better
[1:21:10] and Elisha said unto him as the Lord
[1:21:15] lives
[1:21:16] and as thy Soul live
[1:21:20] Elijah knew that this is God's prophet
[1:21:27] [Applause]
[1:21:29] yeah
[1:21:31] as even the prophet says that soul is
[1:21:35] the seed of God
[1:21:40] it is the Throne of God
[1:21:43] now Elisha
[1:21:46] knew that
[1:21:48] God is in this man
[1:21:52] just as we knew that
[1:21:55] God is in this man the seventh
[1:21:59] engineering
[1:22:02] to talk to us
[1:22:06] amen amen what do you know is
[1:22:09] God is in this man
[1:22:12] to talk to us
[1:22:16] [Applause]
[1:22:17] amen amen and then it says
[1:22:21] foreign
[1:22:34] meaning as the Lord is on his throne
[1:22:42] I will not live
[1:22:49] to Elation
[1:22:51] the Lord was on the throne
[1:22:55] in Elijah
[1:22:59] so they went down to Bethany
[1:23:02] in
[1:23:04] that is the bride
[1:23:07] the bride knows
[1:23:12] and the bride knew where the Lord is
[1:23:17] you know before you can worship God
[1:23:20] you need to find his throne first
[1:23:27] speaks from the throne
[1:23:34] don't just worship anywhere
[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:44] that's why people worship here today
[1:23:47] tomorrow they are there
[1:23:51] is the same thing
[1:23:52] [Music]
[1:23:55] you can't run from this lion to another
[1:23:57] lion
[1:24:04] if you fear that this one will devour
[1:24:07] you
[1:24:10] do this
[1:24:12] it's like running from denomination to
[1:24:14] foreign
[1:24:20] we are still running around the same
[1:24:22] thing
[1:24:26] only thing to take a breath you leave
[1:24:29] this one to that world
[1:24:33] you are tired
[1:24:35] but this one also you live for this one
[1:24:41] mm-hmm
[1:24:43] so now
[1:24:44] now Elijah
[1:24:46] like the bride of Christ
[1:24:50] you know the secret of Elisha
[1:24:54] he knew where God was
[1:24:57] [Applause]
[1:25:02] I will not live
[1:25:05] so they
[1:25:08] they went
[1:25:10] you know together
[1:25:13] if you can't leave him
[1:25:16] then you go together with him
[1:25:21] if you can't leave God
[1:25:24] then you will go together with God
[1:25:28] nothing
[1:25:29] because you can't leave God
[1:25:33] then the Bible says now they went
[1:25:38] and the sons of the prophets
[1:25:40] that were at Bethel came forth
[1:25:45] to Elisha and said
[1:25:49] um
[1:25:50] unto him no he knows that the Lord will
[1:25:55] take away thy master from thy hate today
[1:26:02] That's History
[1:26:05] from dying
[1:26:07] head
[1:26:09] they say from thy head
[1:26:14] they thought that
[1:26:16] he was killing the prophet in his head
[1:26:22] and he said
[1:26:25] yes I know
[1:26:29] because it's from the head to the heart
[1:26:33] then he said hold your peace and Elijah
[1:26:38] said unto him
[1:26:40] unto and like him
[1:26:43] and Elijah said unto him
[1:26:46] Alicia
[1:26:49] Terry here yeah I prayed thee for the
[1:26:53] Lord has sent me to Jericho
[1:26:57] and he said
[1:26:59] as the Lord
[1:27:03] and as thy Soul live
[1:27:06] I will not leave this amen
[1:27:15] they have tried to paint brother Branham
[1:27:17] with all sorts of paints
[1:27:22] but I could not leave him
[1:27:30] so they came together
[1:27:34] and the sons of the prophets
[1:27:40] came to Elijah
[1:27:42] always they were invited
[1:27:45] no we also have got us our service here
[1:27:50] amen
[1:27:52] yeah this one is going
[1:27:54] but we've got the service here
[1:27:58] they came to Jericho
[1:28:01] they were he was invited again
[1:28:03] said unto him no is that
[1:28:06] that the Lord will take away a masterful
[1:28:13] day and he said yes I know
[1:28:18] amen because he was an inward believer
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:29] he knew that
[1:28:32] God can take this figure
[1:28:38] but not the spirit
[1:28:41] [Applause]
[1:28:44] amen God two brothers
[1:28:47] but not the message
[1:28:49] [Applause]
[1:28:53] the Believers
[1:28:57] buried the body
[1:29:00] and from there they continuously singing
[1:29:06] behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:29:11] prophet
[1:29:12] before the great
[1:29:15] and Dreadful day
[1:29:19] but in the days of the voice
[1:29:23] you see so they carried on
[1:29:27] because
[1:29:29] he took the body
[1:29:31] he took
[1:29:33] his Prophet but he not the message
[1:29:41] the message was already
[1:29:44] in their pride
[1:29:49] amen
[1:29:51] then lastly here
[1:29:59] then Elijah said unto him
[1:30:05] for the Lord has sent me to Jordan you
[1:30:07] know
[1:30:09] throughout the church ages
[1:30:12] The Same Spirit coming through
[1:30:17] and now it says and they too went on
[1:30:25] until they fit everywhere they come
[1:30:29] there were people there
[1:30:32] to inviting Elisha
[1:30:36] and the 50 men of the sons of the
[1:30:39] Prophet went and stood
[1:30:42] to view
[1:30:50] they came to Jordan
[1:30:53] then they they stood afar off
[1:30:58] to view
[1:31:02] amen amen
[1:31:05] even now
[1:31:07] you know after the bride has entered now
[1:31:12] in the constellation
[1:31:15] in order to be
[1:31:18] catched away
[1:31:21] there are some viewers
[1:31:28] amen so now they were looking down
[1:31:31] Jordan
[1:31:33] and only Elijah and Elijah
[1:31:37] crossover
[1:31:41] amen and they too
[1:31:44] went on
[1:31:47] and 50 men like that stood by a stood by
[1:31:52] Jordan
[1:31:55] and that's when Elijah now now they were
[1:31:59] separated Jordan
[1:32:05] and Elijah and Elisha on the other side
[1:32:10] even today is like that
[1:32:13] the bride already is on the other side
[1:32:20] but others are viewing from time
[1:32:26] saying it is not a revealed
[1:32:30] this is not revealed that is not
[1:32:34] revealed and they were on the other side
[1:32:37] too
[1:32:38] the two
[1:32:42] who are you this morning
[1:32:52] then on the other side
[1:32:55] of Jordan
[1:32:58] after closing jobs
[1:33:00] now the only the truth
[1:33:06] and the 50 green
[1:33:09] on the other side
[1:33:12] Elisha you sure knew that
[1:33:15] when they invited him
[1:33:19] that I am invited to a church on this
[1:33:22] side
[1:33:24] but I want to get to the other side
[1:33:27] amen
[1:33:31] because he knew that on the other side
[1:33:34] that's where he would receive what he
[1:33:36] wanted
[1:33:38] [Applause]
[1:33:40] okay then he says
[1:33:44] they stood by Jordan
[1:33:47] that's when Elijah took his mental
[1:33:52] wrapped it together
[1:33:54] smoked the waters and they were divided
[1:34:00] so that they too went over
[1:34:06] day two while we went over
[1:34:10] and it came to pass
[1:34:13] when they were gone over
[1:34:16] and
[1:34:17] Elijah said
[1:34:19] now ask
[1:34:22] him
[1:34:23] what I shall do for them
[1:34:27] when they were aware
[1:34:29] on the other side
[1:34:32] you must come to the other side
[1:34:36] [Applause]
[1:34:39] that's where you will receive it
[1:34:43] then he said okay now now we are here
[1:34:46] ask
[1:34:50] and Elijah took the mental or write it
[1:34:53] together
[1:34:54] smooth the waters were divided
[1:34:58] so they too went over
[1:35:06] then you see the children of Israel
[1:35:09] they were with
[1:35:13] there were some people there the
[1:35:15] Egyptians and so forth
[1:35:18] but only Moses and the children of
[1:35:21] Israel
[1:35:23] they arrived at the Red Sea
[1:35:28] as we were talking about them last time
[1:35:34] now they bought the token
[1:35:39] the token of the uh Covenant
[1:35:45] with that talking
[1:35:48] the the the the the
[1:35:51] what do you call that River Jordan
[1:35:59] recognize them
[1:36:06] because of the token
[1:36:10] Covenant
[1:36:14] you know God if you believe God
[1:36:19] he will establish a covenant do things
[1:36:26] because if
[1:36:28] you say I'm a child of God
[1:36:31] and there's no Covenant
[1:36:36] God is just is just a God
[1:36:41] but if then he established the Covenant
[1:36:46] then he becomes your God
[1:36:52] the Bible says so he said I will
[1:36:55] establish my Covenant
[1:36:59] and they shall be my best
[1:37:06] he is your god after an established
[1:37:10] family
[1:37:13] [Applause]
[1:37:14] that's why
[1:37:16] even the sea recognize
[1:37:24] when they cross
[1:37:31] the Sharks and whatever creatures of the
[1:37:34] sea
[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:37:37] they knew that the Covenant people are
[1:37:40] crossing
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:42] [Applause]
[1:37:45] they had to give way
[1:37:48] the water respected the token
[1:37:55] amen
[1:37:59] you know every time when I was told
[1:38:01] about the
[1:38:03] Brothers at the airport this and that I
[1:38:06] want
[1:38:07] elaborate on that
[1:38:12] my brother came he told me
[1:38:14] yeah then the first thing I went down on
[1:38:18] my knees
[1:38:22] I said Lord the brothers are coming
[1:38:26] with the instruments to serve God
[1:38:33] you must get established
[1:38:39] then you can ask from God
[1:38:43] anything
[1:38:45] God will do it under the Covenant
[1:38:51] you must bet the tokens
[1:38:54] of the covenants
[1:38:58] you fear nothing
[1:39:03] God will always answer
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:14] yourself
[1:39:15] in their Covenant
[1:39:19] into the Covenant with the Lord
[1:39:26] around with a token
[1:39:30] they're talking of the Covenant
[1:39:34] all right
[1:39:36] sometimes you'll wonder after you have
[1:39:39] gone this way
[1:39:41] they told you that there was a lion
[1:39:44] follow you
[1:39:47] amen now you can say
[1:39:51] I bet I bet a token
[1:39:58] God will look after you
[1:40:00] [Music]
[1:40:03] [Applause]
[1:40:05] so video we've seen it now on the other
[1:40:10] side
[1:40:12] Elijah took the mental wrapped it
[1:40:15] [Music]
[1:40:16] I mean he smoothed the water
[1:40:19] and they were different divided so so
[1:40:24] ended so that they went uh over
[1:40:31] on a dry ground
[1:40:36] you know because Pharaoh was not so wise
[1:40:41] when the children of Israel
[1:40:44] walk on the dry land
[1:40:50] well I can also do it
[1:40:54] he was not wise you know
[1:40:58] and so he he followed
[1:41:04] foreign
[1:41:19] [Applause]
[1:41:25] [Music]
[1:41:31] does he recognize
[1:41:34] children of Israel
[1:41:45] [Applause]
[1:41:51] the men of sin
[1:41:52] the man of sin
[1:41:54] will only operate after the bright is
[1:41:57] gone
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:04] that we know
[1:42:06] talking about the coming tribulation
[1:42:11] his wife okay
[1:42:14] he won't allow his wife to go through
[1:42:18] the tribulation period
[1:42:24] she goes before that
[1:42:28] and you see now the signs leading to the
[1:42:31] tribulation period
[1:42:42] the Rapture is just here
[1:42:46] because
[1:42:49] tribulation
[1:42:51] can never start
[1:42:53] to operate
[1:42:57] the brother Branham says the men of sin
[1:43:03] he cannot
[1:43:05] her words start to operate
[1:43:08] while the brightness
[1:43:12] [Applause]
[1:43:18] God bless you as I'm closing here
[1:43:22] now on the other side
[1:43:27] and it came to pass
[1:43:29] they they were when they were gone over
[1:43:34] that Elijah said unto Elisha
[1:43:40] what I shall do before I be taken away
[1:43:45] from thee
[1:43:48] learning about possible amen amen and
[1:43:52] Elijah said I pray thee
[1:43:55] let a double portion of thy Spirit be
[1:43:59] upon me
[1:44:04] [Applause]
[1:44:06] he was an inward believer
[1:44:12] s
[1:44:13] he followed
[1:44:15] until
[1:44:18] follow the lord
[1:44:20] until what you are in need of
[1:44:27] is manifested
[1:44:31] there's no way
[1:44:33] that I can follow God
[1:44:35] or follow the word of the Lord and the
[1:44:39] Lord will fail to answer
[1:44:41] [Music]
[1:44:44] amen
[1:44:45] just keep on following
[1:44:51] then you will come to the other side
[1:44:55] of all your problems
[1:44:58] when he was on the other side
[1:45:00] he said now ask
[1:45:06] amen amen you qualified to ask
[1:45:12] you qualify
[1:45:15] now you can ask you can ask
[1:45:19] and now what did he say
[1:45:25] and Elisha said hey let me hear this and
[1:45:30] it came to pass when they were gone over
[1:45:34] that Elijah said
[1:45:38] unto Elijah ask what I shall do for thee
[1:45:45] did you hear
[1:45:48] this man believed that God is in the in
[1:45:51] this Elijah
[1:45:53] until this Elijah said
[1:45:57] ask oh
[1:46:01] asked
[1:46:06] what I shall do for thee
[1:46:12] under the third pool
[1:46:17] he didn't say what God shall do for you
[1:46:22] what I shall do
[1:46:25] [Applause]
[1:46:27] before I am taken away
[1:46:31] from you that God was there
[1:46:41] double pushing on thy Spirit
[1:46:44] be upon me
[1:46:49] and he said we have asked a hot thing
