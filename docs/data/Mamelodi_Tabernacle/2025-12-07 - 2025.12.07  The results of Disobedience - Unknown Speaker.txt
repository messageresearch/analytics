I said even if the church can vote me out, but they will come and fish to eat [applause] because h you know that our late pastor told you that I'm I'm the only pastor who is working with him. [applause] That's that's a a fly by night &gt;&gt; now. Therefore, that's why I'm here proudly. So, &gt;&gt; because I love his church and I I want I want to see the well-being of the church. &gt;&gt; I want to see the well-being of the church.

They said, "M, we must let that child pass to God." &gt;&gt; But not to Amen. &gt;&gt; But to God, not But to God, [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm I really they make me happy. Let's read because whatever we do, it must come from the word of God. If it doesn't come from the word of God, you have the right to to to reject it. You have the right to reject that thing. &gt;&gt; Mark 10 from verse 13- 16. And they brought young children to him that he should touch them. And his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God." &gt;&gt; Verily, I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. &gt;&gt; He took them into his arms. It was Jesus doing that. I am doing it in his place. Today I've taken this child into my arm. I believe it's Jesus who is going to use my arms today. I believe with all my heart and I believe the family also believes that if we believe God will take over let's pray. My dear beloved, in this time of trouble where Satan has come up against the children, we have only one tower, place of refuge. That is your name. And we when we have children for them to be protected, we bring them unto you so that you can protect our children because we don't have those powers to protect them. I've got the child in my hand. Lord, I'm taking the child to you using my hand. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, this child is taken to you, Lord. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; My brother, God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. H you may just take your seats for a while and you sing that song of receiving [music] the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; in the pulpit. But in the days [music] of the voice [singing] when he [music and singing] begin to &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; There [singing] should [music] be finished as he has to be [music] asold you [music] and I [singing] shall the prophets before [music] the great and [music] pro [singing] [music] the heart [singing] of the father to the children. [music] Hearts [singing] of the children to the father. [music] Yes, I [singing] come. Oh yes, [music] thy crown is my [singing] [music] [music] holy [music and singing] Oh, we will come with power. [music] [singing] [music] Holy Ghost, [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; You must know you are the only church who sing that song. Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; In the days &gt;&gt; you are the only church. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you are making me pleased because that man has brought everything unto us. [applause] We lack nothing. We lack nothing. because of that man. &gt;&gt; What she has brought &gt;&gt; is still with us. We would not be like this if it was not because of him. Uh brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; I want to thank our board and the elders for the work they are they they do. Um, Mete and Elders, &gt;&gt; they went that side to help the family to bury their loved ones. Even when we were going through the marriage, they helped another family contacting the barrier. and even last Saturday and brothers and even those who perhaps I've not mentioned they went to help us to bury one of us to bury one of us You must know they are doing that in my place. [applause] [clears throat] doing those things but they were doing those things for me. So that is the reason I have to thank them very much. This church is established. [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; They can do things for themselves. They lack nothing. &gt;&gt; We really uh I think they will they will always send message to thanking him also because he is he's one of our subordinates. I had a message from a reliable source that our late pastor. He had in his mind that he will bring me and pastor Miva here. Me and Pastor M and introduce us to you that we shall go on with you. But pastor Miva told me that I am confident in you. I'm I'm giving I'm I'm giving you the my full support. [applause] I believe you you are the one who will be able to help those. You must know that I am here. I've have the support of pastor MBA. But if one day if it happened that I send him here, you must know he has been sent by me. He's not he is not gate crashing. &gt;&gt; Is me sending him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; There is a there is a certain uh thing I want to clarify a certain lie. I want to clarify it to you church. &gt;&gt; That lie is And it is spreading fast saying that &gt;&gt; is the one who brought Mete and Scosana back. That one is a lie from the devil. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; You must tell the one who tell you that my brother sorry &gt;&gt; you are attacked is not me is the pastor himself he is the one who told me. When I went to him, I was going to ask for additional preachers to help Mahar. I was with Eld. The pastor told me where is [applause] he is he is the preacher there [applause] or do you say I'm telling you lie &gt;&gt; sorry &gt;&gt; do you say I'm telling you lie is a witness. &gt;&gt; Is a witness is a witness. And I told the brother I said if the pastor can say something contrary to what he has told me now. You must record the pastor and send that message quickly to me. so that I could come fast, so that I cannot do something which is against my pastor. Until now, I haven't received anything to me that still stands. [applause] I I want to correct that lie. You see people talking lies like that. They must think what David did. I must I I am the anointed pastor of God. If you talk lie about me, God will punish you. It may not be today. But that thing will follow you and it will follow even your children. You must correct that lie. On that day, &gt;&gt; I I I I I I was having two things. &gt;&gt; The the other one was to [music] tell the pastor about the conference. &gt;&gt; What are we going to do in the conference? Read the minutes from the board. about the conference. When he was reading the minutes, there was the place where the board in that minutes saying that Elder um is going to be the chair, the the master of ceremony in that conference. conference. &gt;&gt; The pastor said, "Let it be. Let it let it be. I still have those minutes. I cancelled. I still have those minutes." And we were saying something about um someone who will be responsible for listing pastors there in the minutes. Then the pastor said in the minutes they said it will be the pastor said it must be het [applause] we must take over those side. It is his it is his position &gt;&gt; is not me. is the pastor himself whether you take it or not. &gt;&gt; That is what my pastor has told me and I stand by that anything told me about letters issued I I I I went to the pastor. &gt;&gt; I said, "Can I announce these letters to the church?" He said, "No, no, no." Why? Why did he say that? because he didn't want to come and and go back &gt;&gt; because anything must be you mustn't take anything if it is not from the pulpit here [applause] that is church order anything that is not from the the church that the They they bought here is a gossip. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be careful of those things. If someone told you we shall you must tell it we shall listen to the pulpit. &gt;&gt; We shall listen to the announcement. TV show. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me, church? Leave those people. God will deal with them. Even David didn't want to touch Saul. Even if Saul was after David, David said, "This is the anointed of God. If the anointed of God, you mustn't just talk. If he is, even if he's wrong, you mustn't just talk. That person is the anointed of God. &gt;&gt; All right. I I I just wanted to to to clarify this lie. Um, let's just h I want to to to put the video of my pastor here and hear what the pastor says about church order. Let's let's hear While we are preaching here, we are preaching just to a small group, not the other churches. Yeah. Our way our our way here is going to the heart, not to the church. That's why some are say are talking about the fivefold ministry ministry &gt;&gt; but they don't know what is fivefold ministry. All right. We've got them prepared them for us only. We don't we also don't make use of them. That's why we will go the other way. Okay. Let us go back to the church order. If each and every one of us can get a copy &gt;&gt; and look at the church order. Amen. All right. Yeah. Without church order, things go the other way. [applause] Have you have you heard that? That's why even pastor said to me we know you pastor no one will take you away from church order even now over my dead body I will not move from church order. You can ridicu me. and talk bad about me. I will not I will not worry. But when you force to go out of church, if you want to see me furious, try to go out of church order. I will not I will never allow you. We we better we better our our relationship. It it might it can be broken. &gt;&gt; We must follow church order. Put what the pastor said there. Let's let's hear what the pastor is saying. I want us to hear the our pastor. The people who after following Moses followed Joshua and the the prophet not a certain pastor. Uh please don't listen and say brother says it should be this you take it from God's prophet Paul says follow me as I follow me as I follow the prophets. Amen. But if I don't follow the prophet, don't follow me. I am leading you astray. Check whether the message I preach is from the word of God. All right. Check. Thank you, my brothers. Have you heard what the pastor said? He said, don't say pastor. &gt;&gt; Don't say, take it from the prophet. But when you go around saying pastor, it's up to you. It's not what he said. He said you must take it from &gt;&gt; the prophet. [applause] Have you heard him? I want you to flesh the chesh or &gt;&gt; I want you to those technical group them &gt;&gt; that is the church. &gt;&gt; He said that is that first the first is the placing of some deacons into the church. He said our little church here is sovereign. It doesn't have any denomination or anything to send it deacons. It elects its own deacons. It elects its pastor. as you are going to do that it it elects its trustees. It elects everything that comes in and out. In other words, it's the church which allows you to come in. It's the church which can take you out. That is what the the church order says. &gt;&gt; No one person has the say so over anything is the church. And the church are those who come and support the church with their presence with their tithe. offering are always the ones that has the legal say. So in the placing of such &gt;&gt; the church [applause] another quote is our little church here. is is sovereign. &gt;&gt; It doesn't have any denomination. All right. Another another another one. All right. This one super sense. Yeah. It is official as long as the church in our church. It is sovereignity of the church. The church moves or puts in the trust in the in the trust. &gt;&gt; The church moves the pastor or put in the pastor. Whatever it is, it is the church in all that is the apostolic. That is the way it did in the Bible time. Therefore, we feel that no one person then it then it is a dictator or something in the church. No one person. We don't want that. You don't want me to be dictated. Every man, every person, myself that is the pastor that is that is Brennham and myself as the pastor here in voting. Anyone I just got one vote just like any other person of the church here. just one vote. In other words, I can't say you are no more coming to church. &gt;&gt; I can't say that. &gt;&gt; It is the church. &gt;&gt; Because I have got one vote. It it is what the church says. See what the church says in the body. You like that? Oh, I think that is just scriptural. That is the way it should be. Let's give another one. The last one I think for when the time comes you you must listen. When the time comes as under God, if I feel like that woman can no more qualify to be a pastor here, I'm going to mention it to the church. When I see one thing here, I think that you deacons couldn't qualify to be deacons, I'm going to mention it to the church and that I find out the I think that you decon. I'm going to mention it to the church. I find out there is a certain deacon out here doing something he shouldn't do. He doesn't keep his position of duty so forth or trustee or whatever. I can't vote it in or out. The church has to do that. &gt;&gt; But I'm sitting going to present it before the church. See, because that is what it should do. And that is what I am supposed to be as an overseer. I'm supposed to look and see what is going on. We are going to heaven not somewhere or in a rally somewhere. Just just just please Christ is the mystery of God. Just please that before I start. Um Christ is the mystery of God. I am reading it to you church. This thing this thing is talking to you. Love one another above everything. Love one another. No matter what the devil tries to say, You are all one great big sweet group. But remember my warning. It is even my warning today. Satan won't let that stay that way. No sir. He will shoot everything. If if he had to bring somebody in to make him his target, he will bring some critic or unbeliever and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under quietness and things And then he will shoot that guy with some poison kind with with some kind of poison and stuff. And you will start through the church with it. Don't take sight with it. Don't you have nothing to do with anything. You stay right loving. feet kind to one another. Pray for that man that you will that you will be saved too or that woman or whatever who it is. Just pray for them. Stick one with another. Stay with your pastor. He will He is a shepherd. He will guide you. He will guide you. &gt;&gt; Give him respect. He will lead you through and and he is the one ordaining of God to do so. Do you remember that congregation says amen? Amen. The enemy will come when he does it cling that much closer together. And the one that the the devil is using or an enemy will either get out or come in. Be one of you. That is all. Don't never train among one another or talk or make yourself change. We are one. I couldn't say left hand you are not. I met at you. I'm going to take you because you are not the right hand. He is my left hand. I want him to be to stay there. Even the little tip of my finger, I want it to stay right there. Every little part of my body, it must stay right there. God wants us as a body of believers to stay exactly with one another &gt;&gt; and and right with one another. [applause] Stand on your feet once more. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Read. Um, I'm not going to be long. I'm just going to perhap I can take 13 minutes or 45. I don't know how many minutes I will take. 1 Samuel 15 18 to 23 verse 18. You must understand brothers and sisters. I love every one of you. I against anybody. Anything I do, I will follow. I will just I I won't say you are wrong until I come to you and say you are wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I won't tell anybody this and that one is that one. I won't do that. I won't do that. Read my brother. &gt;&gt; 1 Samuel chapter 15 from verse 18. And the Lord sent thee on a journey and said, "Go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalachites, and fight against them until they be consumed." Wherefore then did thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but did fly upon the spoil, and did evil in the sight of the Lord? And Saul said unto Samuel, "Yeah, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and have brought Ag, the king of Amalecch, and have utterly destroyed the Amalachites." But the people took of the spoil, sheep, and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal. And Samuel said, "Had the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to haken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity as idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king. My topic, &gt;&gt; little topic is the results of disobedience. Let's pray. &gt;&gt; My heavenly father, these are your children. You know their hearts and you know my heart. I'm standing here because I love them. We are here to advise one another &gt;&gt; with your word. &gt;&gt; Your word is a mirror unto us. &gt;&gt; Help me and my brother &gt;&gt; to convey only your message. &gt;&gt; What? Not what we wish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But your message to your children in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We may take our seat &gt;&gt; in some in some cases. I'm not going to even read the quotes I've written here. I will just going to go over them. Disobedience. When we say the result of disobedience. What is disobedience? Is disobedience to what? This is disobedience to the revealed word of your hour. They have reflected there is a is a the Bible say it is a rebellion is is rebelling against what? the revealed word of God. That is disobedience and also to to to disobey the church order. That is disobedience to disobey the word of God and disobey the church order. church order. God doesn't like those. Um you see I am here in front of you and you are here in front of me in the state what you are. We are wearing this body. It's not because of our will. This calls this body a pest house. Is because we are wearing this body. This body is the result of disobedience. Is the result of disobedience of Eve. there because if disobeyed God we are what we are today that is the results of disobedience in the times of Noah. The results of disobedience. I want my brother to read first Peter. chapter 3 verse 18- 20 &gt;&gt; verse chapter 3 verse 18 to 20 &gt;&gt; here if you find it you read it here &gt;&gt; it is it is telling us about people who because of their disobedience they found themselves here in hell that is the result of their disobedience. &gt;&gt; Read it, my brother. There &gt;&gt; first Peter 3:20. Which sometime were disobedient when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing where in few that is eight souls were saved by water. These people who are in hell here, the Bible says it is because of disobedience. These people, they are the preachers in Noah's time. They were preaching in Noah's time. We have said disobedience is when you disobey. You disobey the message of your time. Because in each age, God has a message for that age. You will never go back. Say, I believe that one. You must believe the message that God has brought to you at that time. And these people here they were preachers according to the book the the prophet's message there were preachers who were preaching during Noah's time but their problem here they disbelieve they believe message of Noah then we see them here because of their disobedience. They are here in hell. Are you together with me? But they were pastors, preachers. And the Bible says as it was it will be like this. In other words, in our age, there will be preachers who will disobey. the message of their time. And if God punish those, if God punish those, he will also punish these ones because they disobey the message of their hour. We have got another person here. You must listen carefully when you read the first Kings 13 verse 1-24. Here there was a prophet. He was sent by God to God said to that prophet when you go there just take my message there. When we brought the message, you must come back. You must not eat and drink there. Come back. He had the message that he and and he brought that message exactly exactly what God said to him. He failed because when he was going back, he met another old prophet. And that old prophet, he said to this one, "I am also a prophet. You must not listen to anybody whether prophet or not prophet. listen to the message of the hour. He said, "I am also a prophet." &gt;&gt; And he said, "God told me that you must go back with me and then eat and drink instead of this one taking the weight because he had God. himself. But there is another name here. He said, I I I've also heard from God. You mustn't take anything which is not from church order. You mustn't take anything which is not from the word of God. That is what our pastor said that he said it doesn't matter what it comes from me but it must come from the word of God. You must take what God has told you. But this man went back with that old prophet and he went there and he ate and he died. Listen the result there. That old prophet, the spirit came into him, he prophesied. He said because you didn't listen to God, you won't reach home, the lion is going to eat your carcass. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't listen to somebody against the word. Take what the word says, not what Even if it sounds beautiful, but take what the word says. Even if what the word says is since not beautiful, it is not understandable. But take what the word says. And when this one went tries to go back, he made the lions there and they they kill him. That is the result of disobedience. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; May you together with me? &gt;&gt; We have got another person here &gt;&gt; that is David. &gt;&gt; This David he disobeyed the church order. This prophet disobeyed the word of God. But David here disobeyed the church order. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Because my brother read first Chronicles. &gt;&gt; Read uh uh verse 1 to 10. &gt;&gt; Verse one chapter &gt;&gt; chapter 13. Chapter 13 &gt;&gt; verse 1 to 10. &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to 10. &gt;&gt; David here received a revelation. &gt;&gt; It was a good revelation. That's what the prophet says. If you receive a revelation because he says it is a private revelation. He said you must take test to a pastor. Are you together with me? This David received a revelation that they have neglected the ark so long. They must go and take the ark and bring it back so that they they could consult God. It it was a good revelation. They had they must bring that eye and bring it home. But instead of doing it according to church, he called a meeting. Read it my read it my brother. 1 Chronicles chapter 13. And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader. And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, if it seemed good unto you and that it be of the Lord our God, let us send a brought unto our brethren. &gt;&gt; Just just a little. &gt;&gt; Are you listening church? Amen. &gt;&gt; David &gt;&gt; called a big meeting. David &gt;&gt; called a big meeting. &gt;&gt; If read it, read it, my brother. &gt;&gt; And David consulted with the captains and thousands and hundreds and with every leader. And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the Lord our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren everywhere that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites, which are in the cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us. &gt;&gt; You see, if it seems good unto you, You meet him. If it seems good, let's take it to our brothers. What did they the meetings say? It is good. It is good. But you see, let me tell you, &gt;&gt; let me tell you, &gt;&gt; God called Israel as his church. He called the people of Israel, his sheep. And he called the kings of Israel as his shepherd, as pastors. He then above the pastor. &gt;&gt; It must always be a prophet. &gt;&gt; So that the the the pastor must always take from the prophet and take it to the church that is the system is God prophet pastor and church. That's why a sheep which tries to receive a revelation without the pastor, that sheep is lost. He's a lost sheep. David, there was a prophet in his time. The prophet was Nathan. Instead of consulting Nathan, he called the meeting. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the meeting said, "It is good. Let's go." But it was not according to church order. Because according to church because from that meeting they they start to make some input. Are you together with me? Amen. They say you see when we we bring the ark you see our God is in that ark we must respect it. We must make sure that we have got choirs so that they can sing when the ark is coming. And David said to the sers, you must saw some kind of dress. So for him so that he was going to dance with you. Then they take a a a new worker cut and there was the the input from the meeting. That's why the board knows I I I refuse anything which is not according church order. Even if it seems good, I say what? What does the church order say? What you are saying is good. &gt;&gt; What does the church order say? &gt;&gt; It seems good. &gt;&gt; A new cut with people who know how to drive. with the oxen. We should know how to to to draw the you see they went there. They took the the ar of God and put it in that on that [clears throat] cut and they came back. When they were coming down there, David saw them coming. They start to sing. singing with their trumpets and whatever. It was a happy day. Sisters were dancing there. Young men were dancing there because the God was coming. David went out there with that with that garment was dancing. David dancing. dancing dancing for something which is not according to church order. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me church? &gt;&gt; Sometime people dance and they they dance for something which is not church &gt;&gt; and they become happy. They tell one another. But that thing is not &gt;&gt; when they were coming towards towards the city the the the cut tries to shift one one man there because the ark wanted to fall. He he wanted to help the not to fall. He he he he he takes his hand and put into something which is not according to church order and he died right there. Don't entertain something which is not according to church order. You will die and the result thereof is that an innocent person died because of King David. The disobedience of King David. &gt;&gt; According the church order was saying the ark &gt;&gt; should be carried by the liver and they must carry it on their left hand. It was the heart. That is where the art must be carried. Amen. But he decided to overlook the church. He knew church but he overlook it that they cause the death of innocent person. Amen. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; We mustn't do something like that. It came to his mind again. He must go and take the ark. He sent the act to another man. He thought that act will kill that man. But that make that man fruitful. He said, "No, let me take it." Sorry. &gt;&gt; He said, "No, let me take it. &gt;&gt; But when I take it, &gt;&gt; I must follow the correct order. You see David one day, he received a a revelation while sitting in his house. He look at the temple at the temple there. He said I'm sitting in a beautiful house but the ar of my God is sitting not in a beautiful house. I must try to make a beautiful house for my the ark of my lord. He was thinking of his god. It is it is the thought of a Christian. A Christian always thinks about his God. He thinks about how he can please his God. But this time, he followed the correct protocol. He went to the prophet. He didn't just go there, but he went to the prophet first to consult. [cheering] He should have done that first but firstly he didn't do like that but when he went to the prophet the prophet said you you have the right thing but God said David you must not do that even if you have got the right attitude but you must not do that your son will build me a temple What they want? Why I come here? &gt;&gt; Why I come here? Because now he followed the proper order. You see, every one of us, we have got families. What we do in our family, what we do is up to us. But when it comes to church, it must change order. Amen. If in your family, you want to invite another pastor to your family, it's up to you. But when it comes to church here, when you want to invite the church, it must go according to church order. &gt;&gt; It must come through me. I am just at Zis place. At the place, there was a a great festival. The children of God were there. The children of God But I didn't know that. &gt;&gt; I will call the deacons what happened at this place because it's the church issue. &gt;&gt; But if you if it is your friends, it doesn't involve the church. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? We must do things according to church order church order. People will respect us [cheering] [applause] and we will God will bless us and we will go and elect our pastor peacefully. and we'll choose the correct one. [applause] &gt;&gt; Not not according to politics. &gt;&gt; This one favors this one. &gt;&gt; This one favors this one. &gt;&gt; No, that doesn't work like that. It's not. You are not conversing here. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; We we don't have people can convering for somebody. We don't we don't have people here caning for this one and this one canvasing for this one. And if I see it those people who are conversing for I will take them out. [applause] If it can come to my mind, if it can come to me that you are, this one are conversing for this one and this one can be this one. I will take your leader away. I will make them an ordinary people in the church. &gt;&gt; In the church so that they will never be recognized when you choose the pastor. &gt;&gt; This is not polit politics here. &gt;&gt; This is the church of God. It must go according to church order. Not that you mustn't be you mustn't rush &gt;&gt; because you you want you want to get that position as fast as you can. No, no, no. [applause] You better be wishy. so that I might die when I'm dead. &gt;&gt; You will go on with your politics. &gt;&gt; But when I'm still living, &gt;&gt; that one won't happen here. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me finish. We have read the scripture here talking about &gt;&gt; was commanded by God &gt;&gt; because the amalachites made God angry. He said you must go and destroy everything even babies. Everything you mustn't feel pity for something. Paul was carrying that mandate to destroy &gt;&gt; everything. But when he was going there When they were destroying, he started to use his mind. He to use use his mind and his eyes looking at cows there, oxins, sheep, feed ones, &gt;&gt; beautiful ladies. The kings &gt;&gt; they were saying to &gt;&gt; they were pleading with him &gt;&gt; don't kill us please. &gt;&gt; He said I will never kill you. But God said destroy everything. But when he was going to meet Prophet Samuel, &gt;&gt; he said, "I've done all what God said I must do." What a lie. I've done all what God has said I must do. What a lie. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, Satan can can blind you &gt;&gt; so that you might not know that what you are doing is not according to God's plan and you will be happy doing the wrong thing. Listen to the word. When I'm preaching here, I'm bringing a mirror unto you so that you can look in the mirror and see where you are. I'm not saying this one is wrong, this one is I bring the mirror to you. Each and every one of you must look in that mirror see whether you fish correct there. If you don't fish there then try to to correct yourself. [applause] I'm here as your pastor to help you all and I will receive any complaint. &gt;&gt; I receive any complaint from you children of God. But you must know I'm going to channel it according to church order. church. Amen. I'm not going to channel according to a wish. &gt;&gt; You see, if I can do things according to how I wish, then I'm going to to to to measure this one. I'm going to treat her like this and I'm going to treat one like this. But if I do everything according to church order, I will bring everyone church order. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then when when Saul was saying they said but I I thought that I am I'm going to do a sacrifice to thank our God with this fat Samuel said this obedience is like witchcraft. If you disobey &gt;&gt; you are a witch. &gt;&gt; That is what that is what Samuel said. He said God doesn't like that. &gt;&gt; He want us to follow church order. But if you do something outside not following he said here stubbornness is as iniquity as idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord. He had also rejected thee from being his king. That is the result of disobedience. &gt;&gt; Because when when he was there, what Samuel told him? &gt;&gt; God is going to take the kingdom from you. He's going to give it to someone. That is the result of disobedience. He tried to hold Samuel by the the the the government. That government was torn away. He said the way the government is speak your government is going to be torn. Whatever you do outside spoken worden they will be torn apart. Amen. &gt;&gt; We must be afraid. &gt;&gt; We must follow the word of God. God bless you. [applause] [applause] If ever I have offended you, I will uh ask for forgiveness but um you must know all of you. I'm going to stick to church. [applause] Let's close our eyes &gt;&gt; as we thank him. &gt;&gt; Might heavenly father. Thank you for this privilege. You have privileged me and my brother with standing in this holy place in the place of the man who you used in this pulpit. humbly come to you. Lord, I know as a man just like any other man, I am full of mistakes. But sometimes when I am trying to say something from you, the devil may put something which is contrary from what you wanted to place in my mouth. If there is anything which has gone out of my mind, my mouth wrongly, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it not get into your children's heart, &gt;&gt; let only things which are from you get into your children's house [music] because that is your purpose of leading me to stand here. Be with us as we go to our different places. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. &gt;&gt; Bless each and every one of us. I pray in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God.

Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
