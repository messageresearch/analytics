[57:00] and the bible is going to call
[57:03] those on the right hand
[57:05] the sheep
[57:07] little
[57:10] foreign
[57:24] we are going to read it it is in the

[58:20] we have the bride and the church
[58:25] we have the bride and the church
[58:29] [Music]
[58:31] now back home sometimes we had something
[58:55] [Music]
[59:10] we have our rights as the bride
[59:14] ladies
[59:29] but the bride is in the palace
[59:37] at that time
[59:39] she is the queen now
[59:43] she is married
[59:47] have you ever seen the merit
[59:49] the bride that is married
[59:56] and all of the earth shall come into
[1:00:00] this city jerusalem
[1:00:06] and shall bring the glory
[1:00:09] of it
[1:00:11] in there
[1:00:45] and abraham and
[1:00:48] the seed of abraham were on their on on
[1:00:52] pilgrimage
[1:01:08] and the seed of abraham
[1:01:12] for that
[1:01:16] because they were in abraham
[1:01:28] [Music]
[1:01:37] but god has given to the bride the book
[1:01:40] to know who's on the right hand and
[1:01:43] who's on the left

[1:01:59] to
[1:02:00] to be known only to be made known only
[1:02:03] to the bride of christ

[1:02:40] you need to meet the king first
[1:02:59] for to welcome him into the city
[1:03:08] the king of salem
[1:03:11] now abraham being the citizen of salem
[1:03:23] [Music]

[1:05:53] from which also
[1:05:55] we look for the savior the lord jesus
[1:05:58] christ
[1:06:15] our citizenship
