[Music] [Music] [Applause] Yes, [Music] [Applause] I'm Yes, I'm way. I greet all people inside here in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You will forgive us to come late. It's just because where we were there were some problems. But uh thank God we have come. We'll now be too long because time has gone. We just touch here and there so that we can not waste time for um God is God of grace. Scott of comfort, Scott of peace. He's not the creator of death. Death comes from Satan. But God has known about it. But because Satan always want to make us unhappy, God will always make a way. So that when Satan tries to disturb us, God took us out of that disturbance. The Bible says when Satan comes like a flood, God will set a standard against. He said, "Many are the affliction of the Russians." But God took them out of them all. We expect God to be with us in this family. He has got a reason of the thing which has happened here. The purpose of God will never be defeated. Satan will try by our means. But we will never defeat the purpose of God. From the beginning we knew Satan tried in Babylon there he tried to persecute Shadrach. But at the end people knew that God is got over fire when Shadrach and Mach were in the fire. Satan and his demons were hating, but God got inside the fire. It was better in the fire than outside the fire. It will be better in this situation than before. Let's open the book of Thessalonians. Chapter 4. Uh, chapter 12. Chapter 4. Uh, chapter 4. Um, first Thessalonians. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. First Yeah. First Thessalonians chapter 4. We start from verse 13 from to verse 17. Verse 17. But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Then we read again uh Hebrews chapter 11. We start from verse 37 verse 37 to verse 40. from verse 85. From verse 35, women received their dead raised to life again. Just just read verse 85 only. Women received their dead raised to life again. And others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection. All right. Let's close our eyes as we mighty God, the God who created all things. This is the day which you have known before the foundation of the world. We are here. We are people. that you are the supreme power that can come and took over. Use our voice to comfort each and everyone who is here. We are asking this in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you those who have ceased they may take their seats. I am going to talk about the hope of the saints. We being [Music] believers, we believe ourselves to be saints. And we associate ourself with the saints of the Old Testament. We have hope. When we are living here on earth, we have hope of the future. We have hope that when this earthly tabernacle we are dwelling in be dissolved, we have got another house. This one is a temporary dwelling place. But we have hope. We have great hope and it is the hope of all saints. When they are living here, they have got hope that this temporary habitation of ours when it dissolves. We have got another house which is eternal which is the house of comfort which is the house of peace which is the eternal house. That is our comfort and we have got a comfort that time will come after death. We have got another house. But we know we don't end there. If we if we if it happens that we don't die those who have gone before us we have got hope that we are going to meet together with them. According this scripture here, the Bible says here, Jesus himself will descend from heaven with a shout. The Bible says so. And that is what we believe. When he descend from heaven, he will descend with a shout, with a voice, and with a trumpet. Are we together with him? I say we have hope. When we live here, we have hope that when this tabernacle dissolve, we have got another house which is eternal. But if it happens this we don't this tabernacle don't dissolve those who tanle has dissolved just like my sister here. We believe and we have got hope that we are going to be with them. The Bible says come as the Bible is saying here. He will descend with a shout and with a voice with a trumpet descending to take us to our destination. My sister is in a place of waiting. And that place of waiting is a house that he my sister is waiting in it waiting for another house which is we call it a glorified house. This one, this one here is an earthly house. This one here is a motor house. This one here is a natural house. But we have got another house which is called a theophony. When I move out of this one, I go to that one which is a theophony. It's only for the saints. Those who are not the saints, they don't have that house. That's why I believe that my sister here because he believe in in having that house he he he she has went to that house. Are you are you together with us? She she is already in that house and she she will never allow anybody to call her back to come to this one because this one is is is is a past house. In this house we suffer. In this house we we don't have peace but in that house we have got peace but we are going to wait in that house because according to the Bible when Jesus descending to put us in another house and that house is called a glorified When he descend, the Bible says he descend with a shout and a shout is a message. Together he sings together. If there if there is a message, there must be a messenger because we can't have a message without a messenger. And if there is a messenger, a messenger is sent by somebody and if is sent by somebody, he is getting a message from somebody and to deliver that message to somebody. Are you together with us? Then here we have got the messenger which is the seventh angel messenger who was sent together the bride together in this last age. This message is gathering the living. Amen. We that are living. This message is gathering us together. This shout. Amen. Amen. So that we can when we are together then the voice will come. The voice the the the shout is a message gathering us who are leaving to come together. Then the voice will come to get those who are asleep to call them back so that they can come out be resurrected. When they are out and resurrected, they will come and gather together with those who are living. The the message is gathering those who are living. They come from different denominations. They come from different places. They come at a certain place. Because if they are gathered, they must be gathered at a certain place. And the Bible says where the cass is the eagles will be gathered. And the the children of God, the saints, the bride are likened to unto the eagle. And when the when the cus is, the eagles will gather. And the cas is the word of God. And when the word of God is the shout, which is the message, the eagles will gather. Are you together with us? There must be the word. The wait for that season is not the word for each season. It's the weight for your season because God has allotted his weight for each season. in our season. There is the word for this season. This word is preparing the bride. When they when they eat this weight, it prepares them to take a flight. It prepares them to change this body. Without taking this this way, which is called the shout, you will never change. It is to call the the the brethren together and to prepare them for the flight. As we are the seed of Abraham, we must just be like Abraham. We must receive before we receive our promised son. Because our promised son is the rapture which we are reading about it here. When he is descending, he descending to rapture us. And the rapture is our hope. Amen. Amen. Is our promised son. Our promised son is the rapture. Abraham's promised son. It was Isaac. Our promised son is the rapture. As the seed of Abraham, we have got a promise. And that promise is the rapture. Before Abraham can receive his promis, he received the the last message from a messenger. And that messenger who came to Abraham was God himself. But it was God in flesh bringing the message to Abraham. We have got a messenger which was God himself. who came in our time represented in flesh. It was a flesh of man but in that flesh of man there was God. Are you together with us? Just like when he was with Abraham there, the difference is just this one was born by a woman, but that one God created the body himself, but it was the body just like this body. The difference is that that one was not born by woman, but it was a body like my body because Abraham made food for him. [Applause] He ate food which he was given by Abraham and in my age and your age. God came represented in flesh. He wore he wore a food a suit like me. It was God in man. That man was not God. But God was represented in that man. God in that man he he was the one who was delivering the message because the Bible said Christ himself sended from heaven with a shout that shout that is the voice like the one who was with Abraham when God was in Abraham's house there was other angels two angels who went to Sodom. They they make miracles there in Sodom. But with Abraham there was no miracle there. God just told Abraham, I am coming. Your wife will have a son. Amen. Amen. That is the message given to Abraham. After that message, Sarah was at the back. This message which was spoken to Abraham was direct to the backside and the backside there. There was Sarah there. Sah was the backside. The bride was the backside. The man who was in flesh coming here, he was talking here. But the the message was directed to the backside. And the backside was the bride there. The bride is the backside. The message was directed to them. The bride was the mystery. Sah overhead. but the message was not spoken to her. God was speaking with Abraham but s over her because they were talking about her. He he said how can that happen? These two men what are they talking about? They said me can can be pregnant. He was he was whispering in herself because the man who was with Abraham was God. He he he could he could discern what was in the heart of Sarah. What was Sarah thinking in herself? He said to Abraham, "What did Sarah say? Why did he say why did she say how shall this happen to me? Because the man who was with Abraham was God himself in Sodom. there representing other [Music] churches. There were two messengers there just making miracles taking Lot there before the the before the the fire. Lord's wife was taken out, but he was not completely taken out. He just got out for a little stop on the way because her heart was still in the world. The heart was still in Sodom. Because in Sodom, he was perhaps the present of human. Isaiah reps. I don't say he she was Isaiah reps. She was the president of the woman's league. He was she was praised there. She was given a position. But these people they say this city is going to burn while I'm enjoying here. What? How can this city be? What is the back? Let me look back her 10. Her turn. Her turn. Make her to turn to the pillar of don't look back. But we know if you are part of the bride, if you are part of Abraham's seed, you will never look back because first of all, you are not there in sodom. You see in in our flesh, we are living with people. Amen. We we move where people move. We see what people are doing. But inside us, we we we are different with them. Our our side is not their side. How we take those things is not the way they take them. How they think is not how we think because what happened to us is not what happened to them. Are you together with me? Then after Abraham, after the message has been delivered, something happened inside the body of Sarah. Amen. change happened in the body of Z. There was two changes because Sarah was barren. His insight the system which must which must bring birth it had to be changed. The baronness must be taken out. When the burnness is taken out and her body must change back to be young woman again. The baronness must be taken out. That is the thing that the baroness it must be taken out. That is the first thing must be taken. And after the bage is taken up, then the body must change. We must receive the word. The gathering is to be gathered where the word is. We must be fed by the weight which brings life. And this the way which we are fed on it it is like cells because before an organ can be formed. There must come cells. It must be cells. It must be cell upon cell upon cell until they form an organ. Organ they form an organism. This weight it must be weight upon weight. That's why Isaiah says it must be precept upon precept. This message is not something that is stagnant. It must it must be weight upon weight. And if those words are coming, if you receive those words in you because you have got a spiritual womb, then in your spiritual womb. When you receive that word is building something inside you. The change started inside you. the your your barrenness is taken out by the way that you receive. Then you when you are burn when the barness is taken out then this body is going to be changed so that you take another body which is the glorified body. But the baroness must be taken out first. That is the first change and that change it must be brought by the weight the weight which I'm preaching here it must bring that must take out that barness the way that the way that the messenger has brought that is the way that I'm preaching here and this way that I'm preaching here must take out barness out so that you must so that this body can be changed. The way that you receive is building another body inside you or is or is attracting that body that must be in you because it's the body you bypassed there. Amen. After the shout There must come the voice. God bless you. The voice is the voice of resurrection. It is already in us. The voice. The Bible says Jesus cried with a loud voice and the the the graves were open and they did get out when he cried there at at the cross. That things didn't happen. But the Bible says it happened. But he cried there at the cross. He died there at the cross. He took her him at the cross. He put him in the in in in the grave. When he died there, he went to preach. Are they ready? If they come. Yes. All right. Let's stand up. [Applause] Let's pray. Mighty heavenly father, thank you for this weight. You are the only one who can place the weight in our hearts. We are just speaking. But the one who can take these words and build them to be something, you are the only one. This is the family. This is the body of our sister. In this we are taking the body out here. Taking her to where we are going to bury the body. We believe that you will move with us here. All the demon spirit will never remain here because we know when these things happen demons also want to take chance but now we are standing here we bind them so that they cannot be here in the name of the lord Jesus Christ we pray amen I don't know what is happening Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm just going to ask the brothers if they can just come and prepare the way cuz the hashes are here. We'll just sing one worship song and we will close and we will be going to Zen Fontaine Cemetery for those who don't know. So it's Zen Fontaine. Um it's just a cemetery on your way to town just just uh next to Sed. So so if you can just sing one worship song since the pastor has closed with the prayer and then we'll be following the hashes to to the cemetery. Hallelujah. We can just say sisters while they are preparing the way for Amen. [Music] [Music] le. [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] God support me that can assist the body of mama.
