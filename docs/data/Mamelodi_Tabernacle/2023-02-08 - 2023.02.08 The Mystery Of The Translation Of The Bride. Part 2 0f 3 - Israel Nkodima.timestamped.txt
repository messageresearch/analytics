[5:30] manifestation
[5:32] somebody appreciated the prophet
[5:36] some people thanking God for sending
[5:39] Elijah the prophets

[5:49] I mean he said as the Lord leaves
[6:00] I will not remain
[6:04] I don't only just want to be here
[6:08] I don't want to be uh I want to be a
[6:15] possessori I don't need professional
[6:18] positions
[6:27] and he followed Elijah of our day
[6:30] until we cross over
[6:34] and they're over there
[6:37] then the people on the other side
[6:41] I didn't hear what was taking place over
[6:44] there amen
[6:47] foreign
[7:19] [Applause]
[7:20] it was a man called
[7:23] a man used by God so much
[7:31] oh unfortunately God took him
[7:35] there was such a man
[7:38] the ministry of God
[7:42] has to cross over
[7:45] so that when the people look at the
[7:48] people
[7:49] the manifestation of the people who came
[7:52] from Beyond
[7:56] the spirit of Elijah
[8:02] amen amen
[8:05] so Joan it was the same Ministry
[8:13] amen Joshua was still Moses
[8:18] now in the form of Joshua
[8:21] it was still Moses she was still the
[8:25] ministry
[8:30] God put it into Joshua
[8:33] amen amen for the people what about to
[8:37] follow and manifest the ministry that
[8:39] was given to brother Branham
[8:44] we need to receive uh
[8:52] you can't take the people always as
[8:55] another spirit amen
[9:01] amen amen God just disconnected it he
[9:06] connected it to Joshua will I connected
[9:10] you shall cause the people to cross
[9:17] nothing shall stand before
[9:22] I may still the same Ministry
[9:28] I mean
[9:31] now let's see then
[9:33] otherwise look at it
[9:36] you know I won't I'm not going to belong
[9:40] let me read it let me read this listen
[9:43] to the man of God
[9:46] we are looking for the promised son
[9:50] before the promised son could come to
[9:53] Sarah and Abraham their bodies had to be
[9:55] changed
[10:02] because this one is promised
[10:05] he couldn't come through the old system
[10:13] because in Isaac more Isaac
[10:18] shall they sit
[10:20] be called
[10:22] she was too old to have a baby
[10:26] she had no milk veins
[10:39] she could not have the baby
[10:43] amen let this sink a bit
[10:46] this condition
[10:48] she could not have a baby
[10:53] there was a promise episode
[11:23] amen
[11:24] she put us he put aside
[11:29] my aim and look to the promise
[12:07] God changed back to
[12:11] change her to a young woman
[12:15] he did Abraham the same thing
[12:19] because he said
[12:21] his body was as good as Dead
[12:25] [Music]
[12:26] all he had
[12:28] two
[12:30] change the body in order to receive the
[12:33] promised Son of God
[12:35] [Music]
[12:38] amen
[12:41] it is not just to say Jesus
[12:44] can throw which body I don't know
[12:49] amen amen
[12:51] now that's why the people are confused
[12:53] because
[12:55] he came through the same channel
[13:01] [Music]
[13:03] now let's look at it
[13:05] and we cannot receive the promised son
[13:09] that's promised us today in these bodies
[13:17] Paul says for we shall not all sleep
[13:23] and we shall all be changed
[13:27] amen amen amen God has again introduced
[13:32] a channel
[13:34] that is channel the sun to us
[14:05] [Music]
[14:16] [Music]
[14:19] but the new body
[14:22] that comes from this born again
[14:29] now do you see the new body
[14:33] and they are new body
[14:38] this new body is not after our death
[14:45] amen
[14:47] that comes from this born again
[14:51] not the first conscience
[14:57] is that in such something that leaves
[15:03] now we are talking about us now we are
[15:06] going back to Sarah now we are talking
[15:08] about
[15:09] you should be changed
[15:14] now that this doesn't speak of after
[15:16] death
[15:19] everybody understands
[15:22] and it is not this outside
[15:30] it's subject to death
[15:32] [Applause]
[15:35] Hallelujah
[15:42] [Music]
[15:48] [Music]
[15:55] now are you listening
[15:58] a person
[16:00] that cannot bow yeah
[16:04] [Applause]
[16:07] Now you listen
[16:08] because this is
[16:12] that is coming water who cannot die amen
[16:19] now a place must be prepared
[16:23] a son who cannot die
[16:27] to occupy a body that can look down
[16:31] [Music]
[16:34] amen and that's the person at that the
[16:39] New Life Starts from
[16:42] Tomorrow the new life don't start after
[16:46] you are dead
[16:50] it should be here right now
[16:54] from this New Path
[16:59] builds another person
[17:02] in the image of the person amen
[17:08] [Applause]
[17:10] amen so if you are predestinated
[17:14] there is in you another person
[17:18] amen if you are predestinated
[17:21] oh I don't have another book here don't
[17:24] worry I'll coach
[17:27] did you know that
[17:30] even scientists has science has
[17:33] discovered that
[17:36] there is another person in you know
[17:42] amen
[17:44] that one has his own senses
[17:50] you get what I mean
[17:53] and but this one has his own senses
[18:00] now let me read it
[18:01] and a new bed and it builds another
[18:06] person in the image of this person you
[18:09] are amen amen
[18:13] so potentially really it's in here
[18:20] what it is
[18:22] the way the promise before the
[18:26] foundation of the world
[18:32] that word promise
[18:42] in the beginning was the word
[18:45] and the weight was with God
[18:47] and the way it was
[18:50] that was the beginning of the unfolding
[18:55] God has no beginning
[18:57] but in the beginning
[19:07] the Bible says
[19:19] and we saw his glory
[19:24] I mean working Among Us
[19:31] ually
[19:32] because this beginning Karma tomorrow is
[19:35] not Material
[19:39] like genesis
[19:41] that beginning
[19:44] it says in the beginning God created
[19:51] foreign
[20:03] amen
[20:11] [Music]
[20:18] amen
[20:20] the beginning of Genesis
[20:23] was the beginning
[20:28] of the creation
[20:32] there was any creation
[20:35] there was that beginning
[20:38] which is the unfolding
[20:43] amen amen it didn't begin there it was
[20:47] God the spirit
[20:50] condescended into a logos
[20:52] and out of the logos came forth the men
[20:57] [Music]
[20:59] now this man is there before there was
[21:03] creation
[21:07] and I was brought down into creation
[21:11] a child of God
[21:14] is nothing else
[21:16] but is the word of God as it is God's
[21:20] thoughts
[21:22] is the mind of God being manifested
[21:27] that's called a Christian
[21:31] um
[21:36] we are not religionists we are
[21:38] Christians
[21:42] can do anything he wants
[21:47] as long as it is in the name of Jesus
[21:52] I said yesterday people are doing things
[21:55] in the name of brother Brennan Brothers
[22:03] they confuse the people are confused
[22:06] about people without revelation
[22:09] you can say something and say um
[22:20] foreign
[22:34] [Music]
[22:55] but you can't do that to a son of God
[23:00] because I will tell you straight there
[23:08] he says or in those days they used to
[23:12] call them
[23:13] flippers
[23:15] they cross their head like that
[23:19] he says today
[23:21] it's a breeding is
[23:29] foreign
[24:01] they don't go further I'm actually
[24:04] they end up with pretty teeth
[24:07] [Music]
[24:08] then after that
[24:12] beauty is
[24:15] [Applause]
[24:19] you see you must take the whole thing
[24:22] from the prophet not the part of it
[24:58] [Applause]
[25:16] write it
[25:19] what you need to get attracted to pull
[25:22] him to the next person
[25:30] now comes the Son of God because he is
[25:34] that word
[25:35] he will read the whole chapter
[25:39] he is
[26:05] since I saw them they packed today
[26:15] but he is in his people
[26:21] and we can see his glory
[26:24] we see the ministers
[26:51] ah
[26:55] let's look give me one second
[26:58] let me go back again
[27:04] says he was the other part of the
[27:07] contract
[27:08] when he was here
[27:11] God moved things in heaven
[27:14] he brought them to Adam having said
[27:18] nothing
[27:30] the Earthly
[27:34] [Music]
[27:44] so the god of the earth
[27:47] contract with the god of the universe
[28:02] I mean
[28:06] so when it comes down
[28:08] now you tell when you want to know the
[28:12] secrets
[28:14] you have to wait
[28:16] by the sight of Adam
[28:19] doing that every secret that is in in
[28:21] heaven
[28:23] this man will reveal it
[28:27] [Applause]
[28:31] I mean
[28:48] you don't have a revelation that is
[28:51] flying in the air foreign
[29:02] foreign
[29:07] [Music]
[29:09] oh man
[29:12] can I spend 15 minutes amen listen so
[29:17] potentially potential is in here
[29:21] and what it is lucky the word promised
[29:25] before the foundation of the world
[29:28] and around there this only reflects
[29:33] the negative yeah all winterfella
[29:37] negative this body
[29:39] that will reflect the positive well the
[29:43] whole ones are positive and the same
[29:45] thing you're not true or the translation
[29:47] of the Bride will be the same thing
[29:52] listen now the weight this is how it
[29:56] comes the word that's in you know
[30:02] the body will materialize around that
[30:06] word
[30:06] [Applause]
[30:10] in heaven
[30:16] and the same thing did by Sarah
[30:23] now here we are talking about an inside
[30:26] job here yes
[30:35] [Music]
[30:43] I mean
[30:45] a man and this body cannot do it
[30:48] so it will have to be changed
[30:52] [Applause]
[30:56] it let me read the Bible and the Bible
[30:59] will tell us the true story
[31:03] while we are here turn also to your book
[31:07] Hebrews
[31:09] Hebrews chapter 11
[31:12] chapter 11 verse 11. amen
[31:24] chapter 11 verse 11 11 by Hebrew chapter
[31:27] 11 verse 11 he who has it and read in
[31:30] English
[31:31] through Sarah also
[31:34] sorry true Faith also Sarah herself
[31:39] received strength to conceive seed and
[31:43] was delivered of a child when she was
[31:47] past age because she judged him faithful
[31:51] who had promised amen okay amen
[31:57] although I read this yesterday
[32:00] we'll say this again
[32:03] how it was channeled
[32:08] because if you read verse and
[32:15] what Hebrew
[32:17] what does verses
[32:20] verse 8 verse 8.
[32:23] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[32:28] go out into a place which he should
[32:31] after receive for an inheritance
[32:35] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[32:39] whether he went okay amen
[32:43] now we headed yesterday Pastor a bit of
[32:45] it
[32:46] says by faith Abraham
[32:50] come over
[32:52] by the verse 11 says
[32:55] [Music]
[32:57] now this time is Not By Faith
[33:00] because the faith is that of Abraham
[33:04] and the wife
[33:06] it says yes this is not a woman
[33:11] he called Abraham my Lord
[33:15] through faith of Abraham
[33:19] showing that Elijah operated through the
[33:23] faith of Abraham
[33:24] [Applause]
[33:27] but with Abraham
[33:30] by faith
[33:38] I mean
[33:41] with us the bride right is through the
[33:45] face of the Lord Jesus Christ
[33:50] amen the Bible says we operate through
[33:53] his face
[34:02] okay amen
[34:04] I will pass that because
[34:11] now God is going to bring seed
[34:15] in Isaac
[34:19] shall the seed be called
[34:22] kaisan all right now we're trying to put
[34:25] it together yeah
[34:32] Joseph was not mentioned
[34:37] before it happened
[34:39] God asked Joseph to excuse
[34:43] foreign
[35:19] and became blood
[35:24] yeah somebody will believe it
[35:27] when that word hell into Layla
[35:31] by Gabriel yeah
[35:34] when it was given to a vision yes
[35:42] and said be and be it unto me
[35:51] what it means
[35:54] she's she firstly she thought I how can
[35:58] I have a baby
[36:06] amen but when the inside the Revelation
[36:10] started to build up
[36:14] then she corrected herself
[36:19] be it unto me
[36:27] amen
[36:28] amen not according to my understanding
[36:32] not according to my knowledge
[36:35] because I will depends on the way that
[36:40] you have spoken
[36:44] if the seven seal is open and he said
[36:48] nothing
[37:00] when he said that when she said
[37:08] the seed has been planted
[37:13] amen and Gabriel turned well around
[37:22] the will of God has been done
[37:26] the seed has been planted
[37:30] the sun will come forth
[37:33] now
[37:40] and Sarah started to feel things
[37:46] amen he used to go to collect water with
[37:50] some other women
[37:52] but you still wondering
[37:55] how come the Lord
[37:58] come to me
[38:01] I mean so it was building up a body for
[38:04] God
[38:07] [Music]
[38:08] and when that child was born
[38:13] he distanced himself from any other it
[38:17] would be parents
[38:22] foreign
[38:39] [Applause]
[38:49] and verse 11 now Abraham no I I quoted
[38:54] that one Hebrews
[39:02] it cease to be no
[39:05] verse 11.
[39:09] true Faith also Sarah herself received
[39:13] strength to conceive seed and was
[39:16] delivered of a child when she was past
[39:19] age amen amen
[39:23] when she was when she was
[39:30] when it was impossible for a woman
[39:37] foreign
[39:42] as we have passed
[39:45] amen
[39:49] amen
[39:51] when she passed age
[39:54] the operation was now God
[39:59] fulfilling his way
[40:07] I'm in so that giving Sarah or lesser
[40:11] could not boasts
[40:17] now as you go to chapter 18 of Genesis
[40:21] [Music]
[40:23] now Abraham and Sarah were old and
[40:27] well-stricken in age
[40:30] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[40:33] men of women
[40:38] amen amen are you with us
[40:43] it seized
[40:46] to be with sir
[40:51] she was beyond that okay
[40:56] [Music]
[40:58] an old woman
[41:03] manner of women
[41:09] she was sort of just waiting for
[41:13] the whisker while image failure so that
[41:17] she can go to rest what are you good but
[41:20] at that time there was a visitation
[41:25] amen
[41:26] God wants you when you are at your last
[41:29] time
[41:32] amen God comes when the dog the doctor
[41:36] said you won't leave
[41:40] amen he likes that Gap in order to come
[41:43] and jump in and say I am the life
[41:52] just to remain a physician to remind a
[41:55] physician
[41:56] that the life it's me
[42:02] the doctor sentenced you to dance
[42:12] yeah
[42:13] when Lazarus was dead
[42:15] he came in he laughed that he came after
[42:20] he was dead
[42:21] [Applause]
[42:28] when Lazarus is alive
[42:31] and also to display his power look like
[42:38] he said
[42:44] he wanted to a situation
[42:54] is the resurrection
[42:59] I mean now he could not share
[43:03] the resurrection with death
[43:09] that's why he came with Lazarus
[43:16] the spirit Lazarus
[43:18] Lazarus he came to the tomb
[43:21] of Lazarus which is the remains part of
[43:26] the family
[43:29] but Lazarus was in him

[48:17] Abraham
[48:20] the seventh seals came to the house of
[48:24] Abraham
[48:26] now watch
[48:28] Abraham Abraham stood yet
[48:35] his ministry comes up to that yeah
[48:39] then the Bible says the next morning he
[48:44] came back to the same place
[48:48] can go back to where I stood with the
[48:51] Lord
[48:53] I'll be able to see
[48:57] amen so when he came there next morning
[49:01] especially knowing what was going to
[49:04] happen
[49:05] he stood at the same place
[49:16] good job amen did you know that
[49:20] after the Rapture camera we will stand
[49:24] somewhere
[49:26] when we will see
[49:29] things that comes after
[49:33] amen we will see
[49:37] what what will take place amen
[49:41] [Music]
[49:46] amen
[49:48] I'm so glad I'm one of them
[49:52] amen somewhere with the Lord
[49:55] yeah we will look down
[49:58] these things
[50:01] for he said I shall not hide from
[50:04] Abraham
[50:07] but what I want to you to look at
[50:10] secretary verse chapter 21 Genesis
[50:14] hold on for a while and the Lord visited
[50:18] Sarah as he has said
[50:22] I mean I mean now here he doesn't speak
[50:25] of Abraham
[50:27] it's just he said
[50:30] I shall return I will return
[50:35] the ministry went to Sarah now
[50:38] concentration
[50:45] amen did you ever went to attend a
[50:48] wedding alone
[50:52] I mean the concentration is always on
[50:55] the right
[50:58] amen the man you can put the best suit
[51:02] or watch against
[51:06] a Dancer the people don't care about
[51:08] them
[51:09] they say oh look at that dress
[51:14] the concentration is on the female
[51:18] now here we see
[51:20] God himself
[51:23] concentrating on the woman
[51:26] amen because
[51:33] a man cannot conceive
[51:37] so I mean it should come from the Menace
[51:42] the whole concentrations
[52:00] are you listening friends
[52:03] and if she's become so important
[52:10] even if she comes in today
[52:19] because they can see that she's very
[52:21] important
[52:23] it's two people in one okay
[52:26] so they always say it's sorry for Mama
[52:29] their concentration is now on the bride
[52:33] that's why even today the concentration
[52:42] is the manifestation
[52:45] of the seed where they preached by the
[52:48] prophets
[52:54] Amish
[52:56] says
[53:02] Jesus just believed in what the way they
[53:05] say amen he is
[53:09] you too I lose amen
[53:16] amen
[53:18] amen and when they come to join like I
[53:21] would just say who are you he said I am
[53:25] the voice
[53:30] [Music]
[53:41] of the one crying in the wilderness
[53:57] chapter 8 chapter 8.
[54:04] amen
[54:06] we cannot teach Who We Are
[54:13] and Jesus preached who he is
[54:19] and the Lord this is
[54:51] amen amen I'm trying to drive you to a
[54:54] place
[54:56] you should be changed amen
[55:02] and yes you are your body is old outside
[55:06] [Applause]
[55:12] cannot see the seventh seals
[55:15] which should be a changed
[55:25] actually to say he's a new person
[55:28] is not to say he started there
[55:33] he was newly introduced
[55:37] he's been there before
[55:40] but as he was now introduced Sarah
[56:00] in his
[56:03] mission that means if you look at him
[56:12] at the same time of which God had spoken
[56:18] amen amen and even
[56:22] there's something again
[56:27] when Abraham died
[56:30] how old was he
[56:35] I'm trying to read it here
[56:39] we'll find it find it for me
[56:41] when Abraham died
[56:44] how old was he
[56:47] you don't know
[56:51] because you didn't attend the funeral
[56:55] chapter 25
[56:57] verse 7. amen follow it chapter 25 verse
[57:02] 7 and these are the days of the years of
[57:05] Abraham's life
[57:08] which he lived in in 103 score and 15
[57:14] years
[57:18] then Abraham died in a good old age
[57:27] an old man
[57:31] full of years
[57:34] and yet after God has changed him
[57:41] I mean
[57:43] so there was something another person in
[57:45] abrahamas
[57:50] still bring children
[57:53] but yet when they look at him he was
[57:58] still old
[58:00] when the people look at you
[58:04] you are still aging
[58:09] [Applause]
[58:11] amen
[58:13] I mean the Lord has to change you first
[58:16] amen
[58:24] [Applause]
[58:27] amen
[58:28] amen
[58:30] because people
[58:33] would suggest to look for a young
[58:36] um
[58:38] didn't they say he has changed this one
[58:42] is still old
[58:47] an old man cannot preach the Seven Seals
[58:53] an old man
[58:55] cannot reach the third truth
[59:00] [Applause]
[59:01] an old man will deny that the seventh
[59:07] seal is
[59:09] an older man
[59:11] an older man would be able to see the
[59:15] Deadpool
[59:16] that is an old man
[59:19] an old man who would disbelief
[59:26] announcements
[59:29] about the clouds
[59:32] [Music]
[59:40] they left the place
[59:42] it formed a cloud
[59:50] [Music]
[59:57] old men cannot see that
[59:59] [Applause]
[1:00:02] because an old man can't see far
[1:00:07] you get what I mean
[1:00:17] [Applause]
[1:00:20] there is
[1:00:27] [Applause]
[1:00:39] [Music]
[1:00:41] put on
[1:00:45] [Music]
