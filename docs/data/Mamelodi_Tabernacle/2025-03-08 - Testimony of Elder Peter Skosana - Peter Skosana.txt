========================================
[Music] uh I'd like to greet you all in the precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ sorry about my voice I had some flu uh yeah I testify years back when I was still now is always on my back about that he said they they did recorded it I think his brother that did that I don't know what happened to that video you ask him it's Amen okay while the pastor is still coming I can just roughly give you my [Applause] testimony it is through a okay amen okay uh my testimony is in this fashion uh I I was around 29 years of age by then 29 I am now 77 years by then I was not a Believer I was here in M was working that was in [Music] 1977 1977 so it happened that uh you know I was just I didn't I didn't believe in God I didn't have a Bible I didn't care whether God was there or not or hell was there or not mine was just luxur uh yes I was a sinner drinking smoking and then one day I got sick from work and then in those days we were using trains I was working at Queen Queenswood so I all lighted here at watl I went to see a doctor that doctor was my friend also so he said to me I need to give you two shorts of penicilin uh I don't want to take the pastor's time pen is an [Music] antibiotic which was allergic to my blood so yes he gave me those penisin two of them I think it was around 5 or 5 I was from work was to work for Simons righten so after those shorts then I saw Blackness and then I saw darkness and then I could see that now I am dying even if I Can't Describe [Music] death but that was death so I struggled I didn't even know that I have a soul or or a spirit during those days and then said now if this is death then let it come great people died Kings died so if he dead let it [Music] come but uh I didn't know what will come after that dat well it did [Music] come my soul went out of my body I could see my body lying there and the doctor and the nurse were were busy with my body I was in another body then I went to them to try and tell them that here am I but when I want to touch the doctor my hand went through and then they were discussing about me I could hear what they were [Music] saying but they could not see me by then I didn't know about Dimensions so the doctor said okay he is [Music] dead they packed my body and the doctor said to the nest call uh the ambulance from the muary to come and take this body and phone the police to go and tell the the parents at home that he's dead right but could hear them so I was just roing around then all of a sudden something just touched me then the scene changed I was in the bottomless pit which is very dark in which you fall without hitting the ground there were so many people in there screaming nobody cares about who's next to him and there's a torment there now the torment of this body and the torment of the soul is not the same you see this body I can take a saw and so it's very painful but the torment of the Soul you cannot describe it the only description is that you go and and taste it you go and taste it that is why I will never leave the way [Applause] because I know what the bottomless pit is and I know what the torment is this people who are playing about playing around it's because they don't know [Music] okay you must make me [Music] way so I was crying falling [Music] crying tormented never hit the ground so the torment is you are about to wake up but you can't wake up we about to hit the ground but you can't hit the ground there's an unexplainable pain so I was saying but what have I done and then the voice said do you know where you are said no don't know and when that voice speaks the torment stops so the voice said that is the bottomless pit that is the punishment you are getting you're still going to be judged I said but I haven't done anything he said no you rejected the word of the [Music] Lord said never rejected the word of the Lord nobody has ever come to me about the of and the SC [Music] changed it was in M those that knows M the section c C3 that's where I grew up I attended school year my high school so after myric then I was at home sitting in the olden days we used to be very clean people our shoes were always shining so I was boning my shoes and then it was during the the the 19 76 riots and that's in the morning around [Music] 9:10 so a mercedesbenz just stopped there young man a [Music] white wearing a black suit came and knock I said come in then he said you spoke in AFC and [Music] said so I said you came to a wrong man maybe next [Music] door we are fighting the buas that was 1976 and it's Sunday today I'm relaxing I'm boning my shoes I'm listening to my music tomorrow I'll be saving your brother who's oppressing me and then your God send you to me to so he took out a pen and write a note and gave it to me I put it in a BL po yeah then he went off next week Sunday he came again was the same [Music] thing the following Sunday until I organize my friends I'll buy them beers let's let's attend to this man so I bought lot of beers we sat and waited for him he came and when he came they all stood up and left and left me [Music] alone so he gave me the note again so I told my siblings but when that young man comes tell him that I'm not in so he came I hide it in in the in the bedroom it was a forro house when he came and asked they open up a kitchen we didn't have doors it's a kchen there is until I said no you go away I started running away from him when I was in the bottomless that's what came we have sent an angel you the word of God so I said yeah but it was a wrong time we were fighting so you can't send a Bo while we were fighting boers you would have sent somebody else okay there's quite a lot of things they showed me friends at school were trying to testify to me I rejected all those things so after that back to the [Music] P back to the shouting and crying are [Music] together until by his grace I just woke up and then the doctor was surprised said no I certify you date by then I was taking out the cigarette and and throwing everything I didn't know how to [Applause] repent so I went back home [Music] home I had a straight of whiskey went to the drain and throw the beer cigarette I used to buy not not 20 one the whole box I took the whole and throw B it out attire there was not even a single thing that was bought in the right [Music] way it was all so I didn't know what am I going to dress okay and how to repent so that the following day I went to work I told my coworkers one of them gave me the book uh the the the St of a perfect man and then there's another one who gave me a soul that are in prison now Inon now I read those books I discovered when speaks about this place yes the place that I was in then I said how do I repent the brother said no you can come to our church he was he was my [Music] cor what call was my schoolmate so he brought me to the service that's where mon knows me I came and the corner knows me is it okay oh can I stop here now to be continue [Music] okay thank you for the opportunity once again while we are still waiting for the pastor I'll just stand in this Gap here okay the pastor always says that the testimonies they edify amen amen they edify in this sense that maybe somebody might be taking the issue of uh repentance and worshiping God for granted like I I've said that when I was not a worshiper I was definitely sure that I'm [Music] right that now whoever want to worship God it's up to him and whoever doesn't want to worship God it's also up to him so it's not the same it isn't like that God created heaven and earth and everybody obliged must worship God and and if you don't worship God you definitely going to hell and in h there's no turning back your uncle won't be there your father won't be there your loved ones won't be there it will be you and the Bible says you will be there forever and ever now forever and ever it could be billions and billions of years okay fine last time uh [Music] I I stopped when the pastor arrived and even today please make me aware I don't want to take okay I said last time God sent a man I was still a young man to come and testify to me it was a strange man because during that time there were these fightings against blacks and whites here in South Africa you couldn't get a white man that will will drive all the way right into the center of myod all by himself so now when I was in the bottomless pet uh begging and crying and doing all then I was told that I was given a chance and the chance that I was given was that now I'm sorry oh yeah maybe it's aquilas want to what you call got a message I'm just saying to so I was given uh uh no this man I mean I said no because uh I didn't know these things and I was ignorant on that and I was not given a chance this seems to be unfair I was not aware that there is God I was not even aware that there's a devil actually I was not aware what type of life should I live because when you grow out when you grow out you just take anything that people are doing you follow friends you follow amilies you follow neighbors you follow whoever right then it was said no okay F but we send somebody and many times and you rejected so the only place for you is this one and when it says is this one and then when that voice speak everything stands still still even the torment stands still you could wish you could keep on talking but when he says now this is the only place for you then you had to go back to that so then you fall again get into the torment of which you cannot describe it now some of the things the Bible says they are definitely true when the pastor always stands here and says may to those that will miss the Rapture it's not a joke when it says the fire is coming it's not an ordinary fire that you seen uh when your soul is tormented it's not like when your body is [Music] tormented it's two different torments remember when your soul is in torment like that rich man who was in torment who said to Abraham send Lazarus just to get a tip of water just to quench my tongue a true thing okay fine it went on and then I kept on begging and then communicating with that voice until uh I I until I I just woke up find there was a white sheet covering me the one that they use after you you're dead they cover you with a certain uh material called k or something so I was once covered with that so it was ready to be taken to m in the fridge I I wouldn't be standing here today so now I was a young man I was not married then never read the Bible in my life and then so was offered the Bible I mean I told the my coworker who was a message believer Solana like I said he gave me the St of a perfect man I went through it then he gave me the other one what's that one can remind me demonology then I went through it then I saw that yes there's some parts which I was in that I see in this demonology then there thereafter he invited me to the service service the service was somewhere in a classroom I think in lady I went there uh there were very few then the pastors was pre in so now it was the first time in my life that I could hear a man speaking like that we we grew up being argumentative and myself I didn't want to speak P or or whatever speaking Zulu only I thought that the only people in South Africa Zulus because my mother was a Zulu so when I arrived here in prioria I find people speaking a funny language I was in mam high school and then they ill treated me so I started hating uh PES now on that day when the pastor was preaching was preaching in B but there was such love that I saw there that pulled me I couldn't understand what he was saying but I could grasp what he was saying that's how now I was taken to be baptized here River so I was baptized there in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen but then I was the only one that was dressed in a funny way when I look at the other people they are not dressed like myself H uh m knows about it how did I look that was the only young lady in that church but what I want to say is that now the pastor pulled me towards himself and then I would ask questions then he will answer me so he took me wherever he goes went went around until I knew that nationality means nothing so I Started Loving everybody but I said the day I came to the service all my attire was stolen one there was not even a single one that I bought so we live that life uh and I had a car that car was bought only to go to sh beans and go and drink so that at night they must not molest me on my way back then it was converted to the work of God amen amen so uh I was not married by then and then the ad the pastor advised me to get married and there No Sisters in our assembly it was Sister Joan alone very few and because my relatives refused that I should marry in a Christian way they said I must first go to the Mountain School I refused then they said we are not going to get you that woman you want and the Pastor said come so he's the one that took me to soo H to get me this wife that's why that's why the two of us will never depart from the pastor they they can go if they want [Applause] to we know where we come from go can go I will [Music] stick am because not that I love a man but I've seen the word amen during my youth time there was this argument about the Thunders some says Thunders are the virtues so we were uh nicknamed that we uh don't we don't believe in Thunders like right now we are nicknamed that we are preaching uh under world world now the pastor would explain everything about the Thunders that their carrier they carry the voice what is important it's not the Thunder themselves The Voice what was now that I'm making testimony so that the young ones should be encouraged that I was not married by then when I was young my uncle took me to in in D5 and then that that said to me you will never get married you're going to suffer the rest of your life you will never have a child then in respect but I said not me then my uncle chased me out of that now I'm looking for that I'm married I've got a wife I've got five children I'm happy in the word yeah so believers it is true there is a bottomless pit but now when you die I don't know there there there are lot of levels in Hell there's where the devil is that's where his angels are that's where the demons are that's where the lost souls are there's lot of punishment there if there was one who was once a Wich will bear me out that there's lot of yeah and even the pain that is there it's not a physical pain no it's a pain that you cannot describe we don't worship God because we are afraid of that pain we worship God because that is our nature now if there is one that says there is no God you must ask me I grew out here in I was are we together I was well known here in M but God touched me and then there was no turning back friends came you see when when when when you are when God calls you there be lot of Temptation some will come with whiskies with cigarettes with beautiful girls trying to enti me but I just said over I've seen the Lord and I'm taking that step I follow that step I will follow it until Rapture comes if it's a time that should live before Rapture so be it but the where I am now this man that used to stand behind the pull pit our pastor they can name it the way they want to I know him better amen when the Bible says he will see you through he has seen me through amen I'm not a man worshiper I worship the word I always say Pastor if you can preach any other thing than what you are preaching now I'll take my jacket but I wouldn't know where to go because I I you are the one that showed me the truth through his mercy so now if there are church goers here be serious if there are people that just comes to come to the service because you are forced by your parents they are doing a good thing don't ever ever lose that Vision yeah so that that that is the long and short of my testimony that was in 1977 in October I was 30 years of age like I said now so what I am saying to you it's a season thing I'm an old man I want speak just things that are not seasoned I have been trained trained in the word I've been tested in the way so I am seasoned that's why you call me an elder amen amen may the Lord bless you [Applause] SC
