the message we hear is the message we have heard theage see theage we have [Music] seen amen because if you haven't seen it you can be toed [Music] about because you don't know you don't see it you know if you are looking for something that you don't see then somebody comes and say no it is there then you [Music] that then he comes there the thing is not there no no no no no it is there but once you see it then you will recite there because now you have seen it now the message is something that you must [Music] see okay now now we let's pass this one but it says which we have seen with our eyes of the which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the way of [Music] life that's it so it's something that happened back [Music] there you know to restore take something to where it was Amen to redeem is to take something back to where it was it's not it is not new there because it was there then it fell then now you redeem it back to that place again that's it now now now let's read here God bless you in in another book here the future home of the bright and the bright the future home of the and it says seven days deals with the old creation the world time and this is your seven days that's why it's called ages because it's ages that is s seven days [Music] that and he say and he says eight days the day with the new creation which it deals with [Music] eternity so you have two things here we yest one which is eternity now it's Time and Eternity because in the book of Ephesians he said he will bring together is in heaven and that in will bring BS two BS one only one part of it is natural and the other part of it is [Music] superal now you yourself you are natural and another part of is superal so the message come in the [Music] same now one part of you is natural that part cannot see but you have another that's why you have the church ages and and the now when it comes to [Music] the something [Music] here and he will tell us something about the seal [Music] amen right [Music] now page 567 amen page 567 of the seals it says yeah amen okay he says what is this what this great secret that lays beneath this this seal amen the secret lays beneath the seven SE what is that [Music] Secrets do not know and he says I don't know I couldn't make it but I know that it was seven themselves Clos together seven different times and it unfolded into something that I have seen I see I for interpret so that is the end of theeven it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [Music] now you know josua before they comp Jer he met a man with a sword met anel now God said to them go seven times every [Music] day they take but on the seventh day he says to them go seven times they were counting days each day [Music] one the second day the thir day the walls were not falling day one but he says on the go around seven times so it gives you the churches and the [Music] Seals superal happen they went seven times and the walls fall seven days seven times amen so now he says it been seven times but the thing was still standing then he says he looked for the [Music] interpretation he saw something but he for [Music] interet amen and he says the interpretation that flew that was flying because amen because we have seven Church each Church AG has a [Music] messenger these are M but within the pyramid there was a within the pyramid here there was something mysterious when it was shown in a vision there was [Music] Junior because started as the foundation St [Music] amen no interpret say the angels He Saw they came with the interpretation of the white sto [Music] they interpreted the unwritten [Music] word theeven [Music] SE is [Music] [Applause] [Applause] on what God Said [Music] [Applause] don't don't say anything that Revelation 10 ver4 when it 1 2 3 4 5 6 then he said don't write anything because the ministry was not of Jo the ministry wasend mess so John was forbidden to write anything [Music] that [Music] in because he says stop to write what John could not write the coming of the Lord [Music] hallu the that remain a secret coming will will come you know how a thief comes only notice when a thief is is in your house that's why the coming of the Lord when he has come to you something that the people will see but you will notice it after come to you amen without any specific appointment now the open of the is the coming of the lordes he was looking for the interpretation amen amen and he says now the Reas the reason to go [Music] west because you know in the Book of Genesis the Bible says God made [Music] a [Music] and he put the man he has made now I'm talking about Eastward don't know that I'll be starting from the West amen so the Bible says God plac his Adam because the gate was there it is called the East Gate amen that's where they went out when he drove them out they went out the east gate now at this East Gate [Music] that's they came to the gate toship at the gate now at the gate two with SW the way of [Music] of he put that man East [Music] one because the Bible says Christ will come from [Music] theast the ministry message the church started the and went West at the end time coming when he couldn't find [Music] interpret now I [Music] went and the reason I went West connect with this Angel's message [Music] is the Angel [Music] message because it was interpreted by the [Music] Angels the seven SE was interpreted by the Angels [Music] the seven Church Ages was interpret inter [Music] byel so one interpreted by an messenger and other by the angels from because that oneals with ET we can look at this now you have a body which will come to that your body you have your Heaven body Heavenly Body amen and Earthly body yeah so you [Music] understand now inos say to you why the people the denominations the people cannot see these things it is because the prophet say you see it you see it your Heavenly Body was [Music] there now with your your down there you have seven Church Hallelujah that's why the people read seven church church [Music] church [Music] read you see it because says you keep it up with your Heavenly Body [Music] because is inter Ang only up [Music] by last let this because we must take a bre the last time this for the last time uh that's why if we go back to the Bible can we take minutes on this we take minutes on [Music] this can take minutes this now in Genesis uh the Bible says there was no to the [Music] ground amen and God has now you you this this was on Earth this is your heaven and now there was no man on to the ground but there was a man in heaven which was a spirit that [Music] wasam so God was speaking from from the earth there was [Music] on then he had to bring down that because there ground speaking from [Music] here so he has to bring that man because the ground [Music] need only spirit and in this form he the ground into a body of he brought him down body of nature he became a living soul [Music] am so all the the plans the G was waiting for a [Music] maner not beer [Applause] [Music] without [Music] Garden of [Music] Eden Eden is the headquarters of [Music] God [Music] of the person was so it was vacant there was no one to ground and God to wait for a man and you know even the trees and the grass couldn't grow until at [Music] now you come to the superal and the say that is revelation there was no to open the am that is on the Earth open am and Genesis the that was in heav could not the [Music] [Music] ground not open [Applause] Hallelujah had to go west because the prophet and me we are only one part here and we byed our superal while we are we have another body so now brother had to make anel connection do you know about your angel did you know that you have [Music] [Music] anen the people that's why some cannot connect the seven because it is it is connected by [Music] an all right now if you don't have the prophet says never said the also [Applause] for is anel [Music] connection something from you you know [Music] that [Music] [Music] something you can't control it they Tri Africa to stop us from preaching things but we can stop because it's some something Beyond me and the only way it can connect has to connect to something that is beyond you that's how we see one another and that's how we can pray for one another because we can see one another through the Angelic connection I must go he must [Applause] increase okay now then comes then comes who is this we look at later [Music] this because it has changed the prood amen and now it is the kingdom of another priesthood coming through theud [Music] of and that's why now the people of the world are not going to hear what you are [Music] preaching and this is the thing that gives you Rapture in faith and this is the that will take you up in the Rapture the Dynamics [Music] amen so those dnamic is that the rockets in you will take you out of this world coming of the Lord amen and that's why now we have something we didn't our something that cannot be control of the [Music] circumstances in the C of God C of Eternity is coming one day is going out [Music] the amen so go forel conne will [Music] connection we are this morning that we have that angel connection will show us who is this comes after that ites with it closes [Music] with yes the end of it is predestinated and we and we areed your God bless bless now try to visit that is the last one to see before the [Music] Rapture for to take God has change the [Music] pr will be able to take us out that's what the prophet now says at the end of it who is this now if it is this then it's this the don't know mediator is taken away [Music] even then we will read [Music] it Medi that [Applause] now the mediation is not there [Music] now the intercessory box the intercessory box
