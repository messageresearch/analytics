Description:
Title: The White Stone Interpretation vol.5
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on the 17 March 2024.

Text :The pyramid of the white rock

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Revelation 2:17
Revelation 19:11-13
Ephesians 4:30
Revelation 5:1

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the White stone interpretation.

The Lord has informed them that in the end days it will be like the days of Lot(Fire) and Noah(water). We are witnessing such things today as they are reported. 

You have heard from your Theophany, you see the things you have seen. God has predestinated  these things in your Soul.

The word of God is not something that you take from someone, The word of God cannot be taught at any school. When the  Samaritan Women was saying Messiah is coming, she was not  from the Bible school, she was from the mind of God. The only people who can preach the right Gospel are those who were in the mind of God. You will never receive the word of God from any School, the word of God is from God, you can’t learn about the world of God. We don’t have the college to teach you about the word of God but we have the Bible.

God gave his Son to rule over Eden. Eden was a throne of a Men

Abraham could see the place burning because he was not part of that . Lot looked at Sodom and Gomorra and was pleased by the place, he choose Sodom before it was burnt. Abraham knew that Lot doesn’t have the revelation and he could not  choose the right place, that is why he said you choose first.
You can’t go to Heaven by looking with your eyes. You were predestined to be the Child of God. 
Today you serve God because you were in God, that is where you come from. Without the revelation you cannot make the right choice. The child of God goes beyond the dimensions, you won’t see the Child of God in the fourth dimension. Our forerunner went into the 6th dimension, he couldn’t go into the fourth. People are trapped in the fourth dimension and can’t even go...

complaining amen you must report these things to me amen amen okay [Applause] amen ERS uh let me read first this we won't take much [Music] of it's a serious thing when we go to choose a wife a man for the vows here is until death do we part amen amen so we don't have temporary things here weddings and so for let the wedding be a wedding that's how we should keep it and you take that bow before God that that only death will separate you is it not in the Bible only it doesn't say anything about divorce divorce no no no until death separate the two and you take that vow before God that only uh death will separate and I think we should a man in his right mind that's planning a future that he should choose that wife very carefully be careful uh be be careful of what you are doing and the woman choosing a husband or accepting the choice of a husband should be real careful what she is doing and especially in these days a man should think and pray before he chooses a wife amen that's it is do you accept it amen okay okay amen uh there's one part missing of that document oh it will come on there to come on the on the on the wedding when they take the V oh God bless you amen amen yes now as we have read for engagement for the V [Music] engagement is it accompanied by rings in the pocket all right amen okay all right so we'll do this way welcome that's for this for this wedding special I just want to learn welcome vend just for this session you also speak vender how you learn quickly don't worry brother God bless you um we are going to we are just going to pray and they will Exchange rings and give us a date for your wedding if you could put them here amen amen and uh I think this is the way we should do it sorry this is the way we should do it I'm going to ask our beloved brother to choose out of this AR R for for wife to be did you hear that as soon as you make a vow that's all you can't change it that's your wife but now this is the first step into the wedding amen am so let us pray our heavenly father we come to thee again this morning you always do wonderful things father that's why we come every first morning of the first day we know that we are going to experience and see wonderful things that the Lord would do on the first day amen so I thank you Lord here is my brother and my sister just for an engagement yes a sign that they are on their

you when doing Wasing okay [Music] amen [Music] all [Music] [Music] right [Music] all okay amen now we will read now for this morning [Music] sermon and I think God will bless us with amen only some remaining minutes come for all right amen where is the brother to say or sisters here you I was listening to talents here the talents and then even this morning only we had a bit problem with proceedings there we start with the service at home yeah we start the service at home singing together with you amen amen God bless you and I'm I'm recording we are recording the songs here but next time as I say we have you will check again many do not read the church order no so he will check again for us so that we may be able to give those with testimon chance the Bible says testimonies yeah then like last Sunday we've seen the Lord doing some things only you miss the testimonies of what the lord it's not for the first time there was another Sunday we had a lot of things happening amen amen and you know some could not walk and sort of even I've seen even last week there were things that were that were happening that's why testimon edice it helps somebody who doesn't know that God can heal so if they are some testimonies then some people will then realize that no that the Lord God the Lord Jesus Christ is a real healer I've seen that with my eyes that's why I believe if you are sick um and you have hands laid on you I believe that the Lord has already healed you for he says by his stri we were healed so uh we shall instead of singing the whole [Music] day we shall also have some testimonies for the people who want to give the glory to all right amen now brother will come and read for us I think you will also uh take note of this and read the church order it will tell you God bless you let us just we we have a scripture here [Music] I thank you Brothers now we are taking another type of music amen so you are doing well I'm not a musician but I'll come to you we will talk because sometimes the sound is down sometimes up I think it's because of that song Sometimes I'm down sometimes you don't hear some of the instruments all right but I believe since you are the sons of God I will come to the standard of things and God helped those at the B to take responsibility uh you know I once brought here somebody who uh that thing sound engineer yeah who did that s engineering but to some people he was not accepted and he came to me I said brother you have you have tried leave it in the hands of God all right now let's stand up we won't be long but you know for the whole what was done here to be blessed let us read the word of God Amen to cap the whole thing for a few minutes where is brother uh let's read the last week scriptures Genesis Revelation 19 firstly let the they say a prayer Our and dear heavenly father Yes once again we come on a throne of mercy and Grace here is the word it take men to read it takes you to reveal it Lord you are the one who can come and manifest yourself Express Yourself vindicate your presence here is our pastor that you have chosen in our day to come and deliver your word he's reporting on duty Lord knowing that Lord in this last days in the final closing chapter of the gentle dispensation you have raised us Lord to come and demonstrate your word to manifest the Sons and Daughters of the Living God as our pastor standing before us for that special anointing the Holy Spirit and your present Lord after you have revealed your word in the days of the voice of the seven Angel you said all these things the Bible will be known from Genesis to Revelation all these Mysteries that people used to pro at today you are giving us the correct interpretation you are teaching us and guiding us and preparing us for the going Rapture lot amen that is already within us we commit each and everyone who's going to listen to your word Lord that Satan has no power to deceive us every word that's going to proceed from the mouth of our pastor you said Lord men cannot cannot live by bread alone but will live by every word that proceeded from your mouth today standing as your mouth PE Lord to deliver this word that is direct from your throne to our Throne the third Throne which is men Lord we thank you and we believe that you'll direct this word and this word will heal will save will place us and prepare us for the Rapture Lord we ask all these blessings in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you you may be seated for now the the word first yes Revelation 19: 11-13 and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful true pardon me that with that other one 2 Revelation 2 verse I'm looking at the white stone yes Revelation chapter 2 verse 17 yes he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to it of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it God bless you take your seats God bless you amen all right thank you Breen amen amen where is my the right hand amen thank you the right hand the right hand that's right yeah because you know the one who came stood up the lamb and took the book from the one that said on the throne amen amen so we are gled then from there you watch because it came down the right hand to the right hand amen I didn't say you doubt did you read the White story amen okay yeah we are sharing that with brother gab you know as a Son of God when he was reading in the Bible he came across that chapter and that then because every scripture it should be in your heart when you read the word of God it is like after the exams you don't have to tell who has passed and who has not and uh after the exams papers go like penut you know people buy newspapers even those who can't read because the child has gone through the written exam amen amen then how do you you can make it by watching the people buying the newspapers you don't have to ask him or her whether his or her child has passed and even the young CH the students you will watch them they they rush for the newspaper [Music] in the morning that's why every Sunday we also R for the Bible amen amen amen I look whether I have made it or not and I find that God said by his stripes I was healed the Lord Jesus Christ and he said I was predestinated before the foundation of the world that's why you see me every time now you watch after the exam amen you see the newspapers go like that now how can you tell whether one has passed or not you watch with the newspaper they just buy while standing there then if you see one one p in and start running you know that he has passen but if you see somebody in grief and uh cheering the paper and going you know that something has happened okay now let's look at this uh brother we have this white stone and which we actually oh I'm looking for something that I have already given you to you I don't have the second one okay I don't have the second one where's the brother he can give you one day so I don't have it so that I can run this quickly I need to have that of yesterday okay now brothers and sisters we have something here meanwhile let me have that page give me back the page brother because I thought the brother has a spare one sight okay I read in the book here about the white sto which we we have seen how Junior Jackson you know what who is Junior ja he started to look in to he he had a vision when he saw on the mountain there was a mountain and then he saw the prophet of God who came and chopped the top of that mountain the top and inside let me read it and I'll be through just now let me read this part then you will understand or we will understand we need to see something uh there a a book here you know the Bible says and the books were open uhuh amen the events that are prevailing around some people don't see them but we see them because the Lord has spoken all right amen now it is in the book in this book which I don't see but I can tell you there was this Jackson junior Jackson J you will understand message Believers here he had a dream and he saw things now when that Mountain was chopped and the top was remove it tells us of a vision how the prophet of God sorry while I am talking I'm looking for things the prophet of God how he H interpreted what Junior Jackson has seen all right amen can you give me say is the time time say is this the time book I want to run quickly but says is the time can says is this the time okay let's carry on here maybe one is looking for it then after that it says the prophet of God after he has chopped the top of the mountain and when Junior Jackson look inside or inside of that there was I don't know if this carries the same story I want to say uh I will look at the days because after the the the the top was [Music] CH then he says then the Prophet said look inside to the people look inside because the top of the mountain that part was chopped and he said look inside you know when we are watching the events this day we have looked inside and we have seen that the Lord has spoken about this you know we were talking about the days of Lord it was fire and the days of Noah water have you seen that now when they asked the Lord about the sign of the end he told them of this that it shall be like in the days of Lord and the days of now how do we identify have you SE seen the fires that were reported around the globe amen indicating to you that that is the days of Lord it was fire then after that started something else fls that was the days of Noah and the Lord told the will come like that are you watching if it was prophesied then there will be some people who would see those things you know he was recently talking to somebody predicting to predicting to me things he he wants to do all right amen now he's an individual I am an individual and when he said this uh with me there was some inside of me something saying maybe the brother hasn't have not yet seen the the signs rumors of wars didn't he say so Nation against Nation what what is happening now don't you hear rumors of wars Nation against Nation the Lord God has spoken it is just exactly like amen amen but is for those he has spoken to they have had him I preach while looking for something here you know as the Bible says the book says you have heard from your if you see you will see the things you have seen predestination comes in this way God has predestinated these things in your soul but you know the Bible says uh we read that scripture last time when they said to the Lord Jesus we they told the Samaritan woman they said we have heard him our amen amen you know the word of God it's not something that you take from somebody that that man says no before when the written woman said to the prophet of God what you have said it's right and the prophet said she has set it not from here when the Samaritan woman was saying to the people Messiah is coming she was not from the bible school she was from the mind of God because the only people who can preach the right gospel are those who are in the mind of God you never receive the word of God from any school the word of God is from God you can learn about God at any school we don't have a college to teach you about God but we have the Bible all right now this Samaritan woman you are all familiar with that scripture uh said I know Messiah is coming and when he has come he will tell us all things if somebody could get me says is this the time be thankful but if not no problem we are still going to continue with the same thing in the coming days now as it got chapter 15 this one okay okay 15 that is that so brother where is 15 page 15 okay uh It Starts Here Right amen okay just read for me here from here and he said yes I dreamed a dream and there it was I just sat still I listened and watched he said I dreamed that there was a great big hill like out in a field where the blue grass or something was he said up on top of this hill where the water has washed away the soil there was a top rock up on top of the hill like the top of the mountain it was a rock no grass when the water had washed down it had cut some kind of Readiness on on these stones and you were standing there interpreting this reading on the stones he said all of us and here is the way he put it the Brethren from Georgia and and from all around where we were all standing together listening to you interpret that mysterious writing on those stones that mountain and he said then you picked up something like from the air something like a wrecking bar or crowbar wasn't it brother something like that rein B real sharp and he said how you D it I don't know you struck the top of that mountain ripped it around and lifted the cap off it off it was in the face in the shape of a pyramid and you ripped the top of it off now that was months and months and months before the pyramid message was preached and he said beneath that White Stone Granite and you said the Sun or the L has never shined on this before look in on this watch this amen right amen and uh that scripture says let's start here when the pro the prophet spoke to this brother Junior juns juns now I I take I want to take this part when the top of the mountain was Chopped there then he said look into this and as they look in inside was it was a white stone and he left went East amen amen you'll hear later next week he went toward now let let me say to you the Garden of Eden was placed which me the Throne of men the men you know Aiden Eden was the Throne of men God gave his son to rule over Eden so that's why Eden was made in the West Was put Westward I mean Eastward that was Eden Eden was Eastward even that gate was called the East Gate gate right amen now it says after he said look in then he went Westward meaning from the East to the West because whenever the Angels Came whever they come it was from the West because men was all right amen and now it says but you notice this part here oh now I don't have my what do you call it poter pointer you have that poter okay amen yeah my time is up here now I want you to watch this because there was another scripture he didn't read we are going to follow these things up to the end you remember last week picked up a scripture where it said ear in the morning Abraham Abraham went to the place to the place where he stood before the Lord it was referring to the time back when Abraham stood before the Lord and from that place he could see s because Abraham could see these things because he was not part of that that's why you see like today um God has given everyone chance to make his own choice that's why Abraham said to Lord if you go east and go west you go why Abraham knew that Lord would not choose the right place because it comes by [Music] predestination it was in Abraham now when the choice was made by these two men the Bible says a lord looked at at Sodom and he was pleased by the place he saw it as fertile when Agri culture can really uh Prosper Prosper but the Bible says Abraham Abraham ask Lord to choose first you know Abraham knew very well that Lord didn't have a revelation and he knew that Lord could not choose the right place that's why he said amen amen and then Lord was so pleased but the Bible says he made that choice before meaning that Abraham knew Insight of his because if God send somebody he puts all that the man is about to engage in his soul amen amen amen you can't go to Heaven by watching with your eyes looking with your eyes no because the Bible says you were predestinated you are in God today you serve God because you are in God that's where you came from each and every person has a revelation if it is not a revelation then you can't make the right choice it's only by Revelation that's why while preaching here you see a child of God a child of God once he started uh after he has found the Lord he start moving amen amen across the dimensions you you won't see the child of God ring in the fourth dimension that's not a child of God a child of God goes beyond the dimension amen amen because there are dimensions Dimension and dimension Dimension I I will read those things to you MH amen now you know Abraham Paul as a forerunner he says he went to the third heaven he didn't need an Apollo no that thing was in [Music] him and he went to the thir and you know our forun went to six diens amen amen he couldn't go to the fourth no I'll show you the fourth di how the people are trapped they can't go further even if you preach to them they are still stuck in the four dimension television have you ever seen me in television no I don't belong to that Dimension all right amen now his Dimensions dimension we will read you'll see that some people are in trying to worship God they found themselves stuck in fourth dimension and once they are there even if you preach the word of God they remain in that Dimension why they can't see further than that that's why Lord saw Sodom L saw Sodom as a nice place but the Bible says he chose before the Judgment was coming to Sodom then Abraham that's why he couldn't go there because the Judgment was coming but Lord chose that place where the fire was coming is the same thing today uh you are reading about the nuclear bombs and so people don't care about those things but those things they are in the Bible and you know the prophet of God especially the seventh what did he say about America is it is it not happening it's coming that's right all right amen uh I won't touch that today but what was prophesied the nutal home all these things will come and read the prophecy of these things and they are happening now amen did you see what is happening in Israel the Jews and the Gentiles now is getting towards that terrible time called the tribulation period you know tribulation per it won't come and the maybe the newspaper say to you the tribulation starts on Monday Abraham you didn't need to to read the newspaper to know it no what God would do as God said shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do if you are a child of God God never will never hide something from you in as a child H he will put you in a place so that you together with him you'll be able to see this things that's why Abraham was close with God like this at the time of Sodom God said shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do meaning that God everything that he do uh he would reveal that to Abraham Abraham now I'm going to do this amen I want to worship such a god The God Who will talk to me if there's something coming the God will tell me about amen amen Fellowship With God all right amen uh you become a friend with God and he won't hide from you your soul is more than a newspaper because you are notified of God Amen you know that scripture shall I from Abraham the thing that I do there's another scripture before I close we read that last was it a revelation we read the scripture together with this one Revelation 19 was it vers 11 to3 I think so amen okay yes and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that said upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he do judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself Hallelujah and he was clothed with a vure dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God Amen right amen his name he has a name known only to himself amen uh if he reveals himself to you he is revealing his name his name in you becomes a revelation that's why when he speaks you hear amen yes because it's a special name okay amen like Abraham you know before theing of s the Bible says he got up early in the morning went where to the place where he stood before the [Music] Lord amen maybe you understand amen why because in that place God has shown him things now every time he would want to see the progress there or things that are happen he went back to the place where he stood before the Lord and once he arrived there he looked and saw Sodom but which place where he stood before the Lord amen that's why the Bible says uh what the scripture again Ephesians chapter yeah grief not the and grief not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption whereby you are oh meaning you are a Sil person amen you know sealed and what if you everything is sealed so sealed the day meaning nothing will happen to you the day of R sealed by God amen there are people that are sealing praise God Satan will never touch they are sealed amen amen you know if there's something is SE that means it is [Music] special and it has even a stle until it reach the destination amen that's why he says you shall not die if you believe in him because we are [Applause] sealed Satan is no [Music] match he was defeated Mel kicked him down when he rebelled against God amen amen but those who remained amen these are the spirits of God all right let me finish with this but did you hear that sealed until the destination now the day of redemption how do you know you are redeemed because there's a book of redemption you should know if you are sealed or not now the day of redemption I find in the Bible I think find in the spoken that it is the day the book was open is it the lamb that came and took the book from the one so your name was in there not not Church book God's book amen amen I we won't we'll see next time but it says so amen took the book from the one that set on the throne uh and that book was in the right [Music] hand chapter 5 what it says cling 5 minutes Revelation 5 over verse one right and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written Within and on the backside sealed with seven Cals amen that's why you know or the book is written within and on the you will we will read it next time amen amen so there's a two dimension of the book but we'll come to a place when we will look to the right then you'll realize that the book from the right hand side that if you come down you will see the angel on the right hand side we will read amen amen and job spoke of this we shall read you should know whether you are on the right or left okay amen because he says at that day he shall say to he he shall say to those in his right hand in the Kingdom of your father but to the left it will be a different judgment Book of Matthew tell us so even right now there are people on the right hand side people on the left amen they don't agree the right hand people don't agree with the left yeah left hand side is that right amen like amen as I'm saying while I'm preaching you say amen amen but I will carry on to preach but I will come to a place where your arm will [Music] stop one said you know I love that church in I think there's too much loss you know what is law too much too much L and we we we always read out of the Bible and the books the law the children of Israel were given law and afterwards God said they could not keep the law so he came with Grace you know for me and you to be called children of God today is because he didn't give us law he has given us [Music] [Applause] Grace So by Grace not of our works but by Grace when I was a sinner God by his grace he saw me as a sinner he came to the world to die for Sinners he become a sacrifice in the form of Jesus Christ amen amen we were saved not by law but by Grace amen Grace don't say don't do that don't do that no you are born again if you are born an African change it you are an African and you love to be African if you are born in Indian you you even love it you are an Indian that's how that's why now in state of law it was now changed to a birth amen you can see me I'm an African amen I can smar myself with all kind of things people continue say how are you D I can apply whole lot of things now a Christian also is a Christian they killed them but they are with Him amen you know what they Stone now I love this you see I'm losing while they were picking up Stones hitting him with stones the Bible says he saw heaven open amen amen go stoning the man he never beg for Mery Eternal being Eternal being won ask for mer from when they leave when they live they live for Christ the Bible says when you live is for Christ when you die is for Christ St died for Christ and God confirmed that while they were hitting him with ston Heaven [Applause] [Music] open and he said Lord forgive them this the Lord Jesus said Lord forgive them they know not they all right amen no this is just introdu we continue the Lord will we follow like last week I was trying to say something uh the brother has just read the scripture about the one from Heaven he has a name known only will come we are still coming to that because he came and but he was followed by he had some followers then I ask a question Battle of am people still don't know who is [Applause] against that is called the ble of because you see it the river EES the way of the of the of the East of the East amen that's why China is moving those of the East because you have the the King of the North referring to Russia and all this but God will help us you see this the reason you don't see that the battle who's fighting it is because it was fought it started in heaven it started back there when Lucifer Was Defeated he was cast down then he started the B since then you see people reting in the seas and so forth many evil the lot of evil is done in the water amen amen many people as we have seen some uh who would go to the river
