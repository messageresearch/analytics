Title: What Is This Great Secret That Lays Beneath This Seal The 7th
Text: Theophany is A Body Subject To The Word Of God.

Description: This message was preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi  tabernacle in South Africa on the 08 January 2023.

The purpose of this sermon was to teach the viewers and community about the secret that lays beneath the seventh seal, according to Rev 8:1. The pastor read Revelation 8:1 “And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour”. and Revelation 5: 1 - 5  “And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.
5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.”

In his teaching he indicated that when there was no man worthy to loose the seal, God himself came and took the place of a warrior to loose the seven seals. 

He further shows the audience that what caused the silence in Heaven was because the things in heaven were coming down on the earth. He made reference from Revelation 21: 1 - 4, and verse two says; “And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.”

He also encourages the audience that a Christian hears God and not just about God

my father as we hear the word in Jesus mighty name amen amen you may be seated God bless you amen amen [Music] opening of the of the the seventh and what the Bible says what happened one day and there was silence a bit of a space of half an hour uh in heaven meaning the activity is as we were looking even last time that even the angels stop their happiness when there was such an activity they were looking at things that the Lord was saying even the heavens itself is coming down and well the Bible says and Revelation chapter 21 it shows the new Heaven and the new age and it tells us about the Tabernacle of God with me in his will be with us amen amen all right I don't think it is frightening to say God will be with us amen you know when the lamp opened the book before even he opened it he took the book it says from him that said he had the book on the writing because the children of God are the right-hand people because all the Mysteries came down they're like amen amen and so now that's why there was John said there was a jubilee the one with you he was waited to take the books amen and because an angel came when no one was founded to open the title and the angel came and said Revelation chapter 5 brother verse 1. okay amen and they sang a song so that's why together we as human beings forgiveness we ought to be the people who really would look into the world and seeing what he has done for us when no one was there is one age when the Forerunner saw him he said that taketh away the sinners that was a John he released on the banks of Jordan This John also what happened when asked who are you said I am the one the voice of one okay so this way to one was introduced you're only one I mean when John introduced him healthy also introduced himself amen amen I am the one The Voice verse chapter 40. I Am The Voice one crying in the world make straight The Way of the World amen amen now John like an eagle by the river of Jordan he was there looking around expecting the way she wanted amen amen that's why today we are the sons and daughters because of that word Revelation chapter 5 verse 1. and I saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the souls thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth never under the Earth was able to open the book never to look there on and I wept much because no man was found wealthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me whip not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to lose the souls thereof amen amen you know how many do you know that there was a battle in heaven the things started there sin started there Rebellion started there um when Lucifer hello Lucifer started that battle and uh Michael yeah cast him down Lucifer in his angels down to the Earth there was this man who has placed there as the god of the Earth Adam So Adam Adam he says headquarters was called the Garden of Eden because Eden Eden was the headquarters of God the headquarters but the Garden of Eden edging was the headquarters and when Lucifer was cast down and he came to Eden Eddie that's when he started the same battles and started and continue he continued actually right now on Earth rebelling against God even this morning it is uh the Lord Jesus called him the prince of this world yeah and so forth but then fella no one was worthy to fight him um yes the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ God himself to the form actually of a warrior amen amen but he is righteousness and he came armed with his words called the Lamb of God but that was God Amen okay yes sir okay now why you read that scripture what's that scripture again revelation 5. all right you are right yes yes yes yes okay now surely revelation chapter 8. and can we preach is there someone out of that amen now yes sir because it was just silence amen amen can you preach amen out of that yes sir yes but it says in heaven foreign I think last we went through that here on Earth there was activities let us look into this uh we will see even the this eternal beings the people but whom God has ordained before the foundation of the world amen amen and they are here and now we we're starting with this Revelation chapter seven meaning uh what is this great secrets that lays beneath the seal says meaning if it is amen amen and what is that great secret all the seals when they are they are open you see something but this one you don't see amen amen then I'm looking at my books here you know the spoken word is the original seat he the spoken word is the original seat amen it sees it says but I will start here when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek he unfolds to hear what all the attributes will do in the Final End is amen so uh king of Salem Illinois Abraham when he looked for a city the king Melchizedek now that is the kingdom of Melchizedek the Bible says without father without mothers but yes that's why if you read in the book chapter one of Revelation foreign yes I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending says the Lord which is and which was and which is to come Almighty amen now a lot of you must say uh listen carefully uh it doesn't start with Words which is amen which is foreign [Applause] so you you start with the God who is is still the same one and get to know about the one who's to come as when you know the one who is amen amen you can't wait for the one to come when you don't know amen because you've known the one who is that's why the Bible says take him and find him amen amen you seek him he says amen amen don't just attend the church the calling is not to the church to him you'll find him you have found life he said he who finds me finds life amen amen the person you must fight you should fight sometimes we find the things in state of him we find things about Jesus amen amen all right you know that's why there's difference between religion and the Christians religion is just all about God that's why the world is littered with religions you go there Jesus but where he is and then he said or he who finds me a question finds life all right amen he never said he who finds my system yeah or he will find my church is all right let's finish with this guy now I read one pattern you know Abraham Abraham did you know the Bible Galatians chapter 3 says speaks of us being the Seed of Abraham now the Seed of Abraham this Seed of Abraham is the seed that has met melchized amen foreign it was a man that man in the house but he was a man foreign amen you know when God comes to you he doesn't come to you in the flesh he comes to your hearts where there is so amen amen did you know that do you know what is theophy now that's what you're funny do you know theophied all right now when God comes to you like melchized how can he come to you then he can only come to such a person who Adam Adam there is the the breath of life into Adam the body otherwise Adam would have remained a statute and some people would even pay some money to go and watch the stage amen amen because man is a spirit yeah and then God if you rewind hey oh well I'm around you'll find that God the Bible says God is a spirit and the true worshipers shall worship him in the church our when in spirit in spirit because God is a spirit amen the true worshipers meaning there's false worships shall worship Him in spirit that cherish for God is a spirit now that's why if we go back is God the spirit and out of the experience logos after all the logos amen you see that's how God did things I'll see you I know that when my if I were to to die if I were to die and it's not me who will die give me work you see I mean that's why Jesus Christ so when they threatened him the Bible he said to them destroy this boy because they couldn't destroy him destroyed this boy but you come to see on the third day I will raise this amen amen yes sir and on the first day they came to the Sea separate but of course as he has spoken now they didn't understand him when he said he had destroyed this step because they couldn't kill God amen he offered them the Tabernacles because it could bleed but he himself [Applause] when he offered them the Tabernacles his blood is not in godima is Joseph was sent aside that day it is the time of God then when God when Gabriel came and became that's why the blood of Jesus if you have you've got your Revelation that means you have received the word of God and now it is by the Revelation the word of God the way that created amen amen so the blood of Jesus oh God you know the blood of God amen amen yes sir so now surely if the word of God you've got the Revelation that is the the blood in you amen the blood of God he's saying the chemical amen that's why he married after he said be it unto me according to you you know uh with him it will be Let It Be according to our relationship she could say that um I cannot I can't just have a baby unless if it is according to our relationships be it unto me according to you amen that is the relationship that brought a son this son the blood is the word and the word materialize and it was blood yeah that's why I can't start the church [Music] because the blood started the change he said I shall build my church that rock is the Revelation is that right amen shall not Prevail against him amen you know the battle started there he tried it for me today it is called the battle of armagedy well Lucifer is my friend no opposition party down you go oh yeah amen amen and I think you understand Michael and his angels but I have read to you something that yeah those Angelic beings were subject to become humans that's why the battle for magidon is coming who's going to fight hello amen yes the Angels fought but on Earth it's humans those angels came down is Raging yeah and now where are we going at the end teletube we see Revelation chapter 19. 19. verse 11 verse 11. well just read that a part and then we are going to our scriptures and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that said upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he don't judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a Vesta dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God hey and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean he uh you know where is that Army from now let's worry he says which was way foreign now John let me know this now this Army that was in heaven it is the people who were raptured uh was the people who were but taken up in the rabbits as you know the Rapture is soon and very very good the signs are there if you are spiritual you don't need somebody to remind you because the science everywhere the world is falling apart the world is flooded you watch mount where did Moses God bless you is that Rosie God bless you my friends they were talking about it they are talking about that or foreign the people didn't know about the coming of the flags they were busy watching uh football matches football and then appearing themselves on what do you call it Samira what do you call it it's the Instagram and what else really yeah you know them teacher oh I yeah you don't know are you here the teacher and what else Facebook yeah the people uh they want they want to be seen and they appear there yeah okay I mean I'm not too long why are you silent man of today and women of today they want to be sin of men I don't want to be seen of men I don't know amen okay and um Depends for this man today more to look on wants to display himself he wants the world to talk about him amen amen my brother a brewer has put me in that thing I said that brother to take my image out of that I was waiting the image of God I have read to you last time God did not look at you when he looks at the Christ and and God can only see you in Christ amen that's where you should be um when he appears tenacio we will be like amen amen amen you know what I'm I'm saying here if I am looking maybe a far off [Music] and I noticed a man who resembles me I'm going to go faster because I'm seeing my image God comes to you when he sees himself in our image Adam because Adam was his mirrors I could see himself that's what God wants he wants to see himself and you also you want to see yourself that is the image and when he shall come actually we shall see him come on the Bible says we shall see him we shall we shall see somebody amen I we used to sing foreign foreign let me switch aside to this now look under this seal that is it says what is this great secrets which one elephant the seventh but it is in heaven it never said I think it was silence yeah Joel uh what was happening last time we showed some things because if we read the Bible things that are in heaven are coming today you want us to read it again things that are in heaven at the end they are coming here too for their residency even God himself is coming here amen amen ities foreign foreign [Music] amen foreign amen issue Revelation 21 . and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away leave it and there was no more sea and I John amen no foreign foreign [Music] friends let's turn to 12. that one there with you brothers let's go back there Revelation 12 verse 10 to 12. and I had a lot of voice saying in heaven now this comes salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our preference is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the weight of their testimony and they have brought their lives unto the death therefore rejoicing heavens and he that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great rest because he knoweth that he have a short time uh did you know anyone starts because [Music] I mean you said some people that dominated who are they those that are denying the word of the Prophet the underworld where where is Satan when the Lord died he went down where was Satan where if you let the Lord went to hell because hell was not burning hell is going to bend add the judgment after the Judgment then the fire even water will burn okay where is Satan now he said quarters the Bible says when when Jesus when he died he said father receive my my spirit because it is the spirit their soul the body so the body went to the Grave amen but the spirit he said father receive my spirit and the soul went away foreign to take Abraham job and all those things amen so because they were in a place called Paradise so he arrived there and then when the Bible says the the the the the graves were opened amen he was coming back with those Saints those who died before [Applause] amen at this Resurrection and they appeared in Jerusalem he appeared with them in Jerusalem then he was taken with them to the sixth dimension [Applause] that's why that man on the cross said Lord Lord remember me when you enter your kingdom and he said tonight because Paradise he has now changed the dead now in the sixth dimension [Applause] now he promised that man that he will be with me tonight he was talking of the new Paradise the sixth dimensions tonight you'll be with me amen and that's why if a person is a Christian your body dive but your spirit your soul goes to the sixth dimension [Applause] then when the Lord shall come he will pick you up there yeah to come now we Regal we that are alive shall be trained together oh what a great day amen those who have gone before we are going to meet them we will meet them in the air there will be a great meeting in the air amen [Applause] we are waiting for wonderful thing whoa okay let us finish now I did I ask you to read something then what was the relation between the one there's two and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I had a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with me and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God hey you continue that he shall and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away Now understand now what you are now calling Heaven is coming down is coming down amen so that's why Heaven and Earth shall be together yeah we shall not hey it's wonderful day but I want to close now listen now you know actually my my subject what is the subject is what is the greatest the great Secret but I do have what you call under the subject text s [Applause] text yeah now you know my text is this one this body is subject through the word of God I tell you that if in heaven silence the activity now we look we look at this you know um things are changing now for you to be taken up in the rapture God is not just coming to take me and you'll see me jackets flying amen has been taken in the rapture no God is not dealing with us like that but I want to say you must know the in closing at theophany this body what is subject to the word that's why there's no theology with God no it's Christianity [Applause] amen yeah so now Christianity as I am told it is that God is in you for he said at that day you shall know that I I am in you I don't know if if ever you have arrived at that day because at that day which day when they're three-fold The Mystery of the free food revelation of God as the father it was a god the spirit the logos and then all right when the witch comes it will have it will flush in that three-fold only the people who will hear is part of that threefold threefold and that day you shall know that is do you know because he said that day you shall know that I am in the father and you in me and I in you one it's one thing in a three-fold oh God now when the word is spoken it will flush through that free food amen those who will hear are part of the threefold amen only God can believe his word and every person who believes this word is part of God all right if I'm not part of God I cannot hear his way I hear about I don't hear him but if you are part of the threefold you hear him not about him you see the difference people hear about God if one comes and says God is this he says oh yeah yeah and another one said no no no no no no God is this but a Christian do not hear about God he hears God that's the difference you want to hear about God or you want to hear God do you want to hear God or you want to hear about God that is called religion then you become religious but if you hear God you are a Christian [Applause] people hear about God by they continue doing their own things because they have never heard God they hear about um now listen ethio funny is a body uh subject to the weight all right that means uh when God comes to you he comes to this inner men this Inner Man which has no father no mother no beginning of days that's the inner men that's why it says I was reading from this book here you need to meet melchizedeka but if milk is a dick has got no father no mother no beginning of days now the only being that he can meet is a being that has no father no mother no beginning of days no ending of days that's the only being he can fellowship with [Music] amen and let me say to you if you are predicinated of God your soul has no father no mother no beginning of this no end of days your your spirit your soul was not created [Music] your soul was possessed from processed amen God is a spirit they that worship Him shall worship Him in spirit amen hey you know this wonderful God as spirits Spirits the Bible says he is the father of the spirit amen is true if he has no beginning now his son has no beginning if you are his child you have no beginning [Applause] now you can welcome [Applause] has no beginning of days no ending of days I asked our as Christians we have no beginning our body has a beginning I was born amen but being born of God is not being born of a woman because who is born of a woman has got but few days that is this body born of the woman and this body has got about few days it comes dies but inside the Bible says when the body was standing there called Adam like a stature God breath into that station the Breath of Life [Applause] and talk now if God calls that spirit that stature drops [Applause] [Music] he was in this housing foreign drops now now listen closing the Rapture is coming how it is coming is for the Spirit men for the Bible says we shall we shall changes this body has got to know it's not eternal so we shall change and we shall put on immortality when we shall change all right now here is the rapture it's not it's just next door to your house the rapture the changing of the body from Mortal into immortality are you ready [Applause] you see these floods what is going on amen the Lord has spoken when you shall see this know that the the the time is even at the door when I'm going around foreign [Music] before looking around I'm looking at the things for the last time you know if I let me repeat this again if I hear somebody saying to me you know brother man you know maybe in 10 years time I want to be in USA okay I'm going to do DC yes I won't say no don't do that the Lord is coming no no no that is what he sees we don't we don't discourage the people in doing their things no that is what she says even if I don't see it that way because even the Bible says don't say tomorrow I'll do this and that and that say the Lord willing you will do that now to me by the look of the Supernatural eyes [Music] and I am ready when I woke up in the morning I'm expecting it when I leave for town I don't know whether we'll come back yeah I'm leaving under such things I don't know maybe it is my my mind is weak or what but I don't see any future no I only see the coming of the Lord in the in the Rapture that is what I'm looking at that's why if you find me at home I'm just reading the word of God amen I don't mind spending overnight just reading the word of God because this is what I see I don't see any way back no I just see myself into the rapture [Applause] and and going that's all this is only what I see now as I say that I feel funny this body is subject you know under this seal foreign it is active at your funny this body is a body of the world is subject to the word this they are just supporting this guy here foreign you can hear the weight now and the afternoon I visited I find you with a can singing My Piano the word has not found a place you should become the place of the way Bible said God said to them my word has no place in you you see okay we we believed that the gospel is when I go around I don't know my time I don't know my type just put my time here so that I can close you remember when we started preaching we were doing this paint amen you know even in the trains yeah you just entered we are beyond that now you'll get what I mean I'm trying did I ask for something there no okay I yeah I asked for times for my time I asked for my time here it's all right so that I can be directed uh I don't want to carry on reading now listen the last thing that we have is to meet Melchizedek yeah that's good that's good that's good now I know I'm left a few minutes here what do you need I quote is to meet this milk is a deck after this seal is open under this seventh seal the activity there is milky of Melchizedek now that's why you know if you come to the pyramid you find the seven steps to the king's chamber amen but did you know that the church is viewed the bride is beyond that because seven steps is seven churches but now uh where we are now we are even beyond the seventh Church age [Music] didn't we read those things we did all right we are beyond that we are Beyond the seventh back to Eternity because the Bible says uh those who believe in him have eternal life now eternal life you are not going to act eternal life but as being born of God you have eternal now a person with eternal life has got no father no mother no beginning of days no ending of days amen that's why um I can be ancestral because I have because I've got eternal life a person who's got eternal life you don't need to ask him his life tells it all [Applause] he is not of this world his home is far away [Applause] he is a pilgrim a soldier looking for a city a city to come like the bride of Christ there she is a queen now this woman called the bride of Christ he's a she's a queen now look how she's preparing herself now amen you're not going to take that position already she's working towards that you know if you are told that you are a son of God and that the Lord is coming you'll be waking towards that amen as a son that's why it says when he appeared you will be like him will you be waking towards that and the more you come closer you the more you look like [Applause] amen is also like you yeah did you know that what you need is to meet this Melchizedek that's what you need now he's not a he's not flesh is not flesh that's melchized King of Salem that's why I was trying to bring that but I was stopped to come here this King Melchizedek who Abraham met for he looked for a city and he met him well [Music] at the literals please spot where the city will come because the city is coming there [Music] now this came to your family is the king of my favorite and is the king of your family he is the one who met Abraham about you when he met Abraham he was a man is what confused God coming to them as a man [Music] that's what confused the Jews God coming to them as a man is that right okay no lastly that's why if I go back to the Bible you realize that this man who came that is God who took the form of man because there was no man eligible oh to open the book amen why we are like we are this what we are today it is because the book has been opened their whole hey all the sons of God even John cried we when there was no one with you to open the book and reveal the seals John wept that's why we need to be we are called the right-hand people because it says I saw in the right hand chapter 5. since revelation the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written Within and on the back side inside within and on the back side amen now there were seals that were in the book they were revealed by the angel messenger but on the back side you you I I will read to you some things here because it says these things happened before the foundation of the world or these are called the back side that's why it says the ministry has called us to our secret pastors where are you from now who are you where are you going you see now the book shows and the song it is that is Revelation chapter 5. I saw in the in the right hand then because the mysteries of God job says they are on the right that's why you as the children of God you are the right-hand people amen where the Mysteries are performed on there you can go to the left you will only find a Miracles wonders and so forth and the Lord will tell you that they shall arise false prophets and so forth and they shall perform wonders is so much if it were possible they would even deceive even the elect but it is not possible because the elect amen looks don't look for miracles and wonders no I mean they are not looking for that because why why if if there's a miracle to be performed and you asked I was with brother my city is here when I told that Pastor from Cameroon that your mother you will find your mother here yes then when I prayed he asked a brother to take to record my prayer while praying for he had just received a message from Cameroon his mother is sick and he said to me would you pray for my mother I said yes sure knowing that he will be here and because his mother foreign if you are sick here we just pray and then you are healed but if we want [Applause] uh if we want to play games then I'll be standing here the whole day you in the future a long queue amen talking you know I can surprise you but I just said to the pastor you'll find your mother very well I think brother my city told you last time that before she even he even arrived from he was told your mother is healed amen why the Miracles wonders was not something that God has sent for us to display Miracles and so forth no what he has sent is the way again [Applause] and the weight is a Healer amen if I can say to you like I said your mother you'll find your mother healed that is the way because I take it from him that by his stripes we went [Applause] by his stripes we win he has done it already you only need to accept the offer I can tell you that even if you are sick here if you receive this way if you can receive this word you are healed because the weight is a Healer it's not right I've seen it myself when I would be so sick I won't panic [Music] there's a brother here and his wife yeah they even came last time to my house and then about something I said no the Lord has already offered you that take their offer just believe all right [Applause] the wife couldn't breathe I won't call names they know I still believe they are here there's some witnesses to that it's just one of food you know I can quote many but when he is my wife can't breathesis then I said okay what's the name of your wife you know those days when that day what do you call it um yes every time one would be like short of breath every time that would happen that people start to see death but I said uh what's the name of your wife now then I pray actually I called the name they are here everyone I call the name to call her by the name the brother says I can hear she's responding I said no problem and then the next time she was a fight bye that's one of them but I don't post it around and say I I have done I haven't done anything it is the the promise of God to have [Applause] God said by by my stripes you are healed so I just helped somebody to accept what God has offered amen so I don't become it doesn't make me something no it is the word of God and I tell them I can't heal you but God can heal me amen ities [Music] [Music] it is instead of technology and they said empowering Jesus king invented one with mud I said yes that was for that people and you've never seen the Lord Jesus going around with bottles labeled anointed no it was for that people's only then the other one comes he says stand up and walk the other one come you are your faith the other one come oh man that's it so even today I've seen many people coming for saying when the brother was preaching I got you [Applause] a sister came to my office then she entered my office and said hello Pastor hello okay pastor and she was walking backwards now me expecting it to say something dinner she said you know I was so sick but yes I entered your obviously I got healed all right so now this is what she believes [Applause] okay it is the Lord Jesus who is waiting to be praised amen it is him who can heal you isn't I I'm telling you brother the word is a great healer [Music] [Applause] there is a brother he was inside the church like that you got sick decided to go up there he is here it's a testimony then while he was there and then because she he didn't feel well but he decided no I'm in the wrong place let me go to where the word is preached he came down and the next thing he didn't know where daddy pain went through now [Applause] it is his own his faith if we were to testify we would Testify the whole day amen of what God has done for the people but it is your faith [Applause] amen no not the pastor your faith that's why the Lord says your faith has set you free [Applause] have faith in God brother remember me when you started you said behold I will send you Elijah the prophet you're not the spirit of Elijah yeah I we can't finish here but we will come the Lord willing we will return but behold but at the end because that Elijah has sent has come come let us stand up and say even so Lord Jesus come that's at the end of the wait and everybody who is waiting for the rapture for his coming is his song inside
