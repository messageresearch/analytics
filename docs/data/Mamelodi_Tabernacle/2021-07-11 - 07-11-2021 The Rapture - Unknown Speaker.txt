minute and yes would you mind to say to the church house things in lesotho since you have been visiting them and you have baptized many people there just briefly briefly to say the lord jesus christ is there in lesotho blessing them amen we found the saints and we preached the gospel those who are there invited others so i've already get along with him since we've been going we are baptized we never used to have services we have now services with factors [Applause] in just this past month [Applause] we thank god for everything when god told the pastor for us to go there there was something that he had seen because of time there's just one thing that really pleased me that i believe him the people that we baptized not even one of them [Music] [Music] in the days of elijah as we just stand up and can you say it with your horn their horn as we stand up the days this is the days of elijah all right justin for days of elijah ah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay [Applause] [Music] i we couldn't deprive ourselves of the joy that is in the lord as the saints come together for to worship now let's open the scriptures as we are getting into the rapture we are not talking about the rapture we are getting into it amen okay now it's god's promise he has given to his children that he will come now in the process we are going to look also into events before the rapture we have events like a and magog and the river euphrates coming from the garden of eden from eden you know it was a river and to water the garden because you have eden and the garden of eden in eden there is a garden which was the headquarters of adam because you know god is the god of the universe but he has given a little kingdom to his son and adam became the god of the earth but not the god to be worshipped he's a man like me don't try to worship me i'm a man even when it comes to healing i can't heal you but god can heal you the man who should receive the glory is the lord jesus christ not myself not any man now let's look at the subject subject by reading some scriptures and then we will stop for the next time again taking it bit by big we will end up with the battle of armageddon and which which the people that are chosen and we will show them here the people that are going to fight the battle of america and i hope you will believe if i say some of them are here these people they come all the way from a battle in heaven and satan started the battle there and he was defeated by micah and then he was cast down to the earth then he started that he continued with the battle here on earth and it's raging on since ever now it is coming to the end and because it started in heaven then it will end up in the form of the battle of armageddon and here it is now but firstly is gorg and magog which we have one in ezekiel chapter 38 and chapter 40 39 we're going to come to all those things we'll come to the river euphrates because it is reflected here in the revelation chapter do you know where you free jesus oh my let us bow our heads for reading we are going back to the scriptures we have read last and we just hinted at it ok our heavenly father here we come again we woke up this morning looking around that day where is he the son of god emmanuel the king melchizedek he is all and in all and this morning he is here with us like david we shall not fear you promised and said i'll be with you till the end of the war so your word cannot lie what you have said you will also perform and bring to pass everything that you have predicted so we are glad this morning we are looking unto thee the author and the finisher of our faith to speak to us and bless your people as moses one time said these people are not my people but they are your people and even this morning they are not my people or our people but they are your people so we are glad lord to come into this house and the satan the foe who who has dented the lives of the people even to this morning is roaming about but the results of god who came from god has has overcome him before and they will continue to overcome thank you lord as we pray in jesus christ's name amen shall we read the scriptures that is first corinthians chapter 15 verse 51 last week let us just continue now we are getting into it the be rapture in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and the last trump for the championship sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be oh the second one as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again if you saw them also which keep in jesus will god bring with him for these we say unto you by the way of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with his ways you may be seated god bless you okay i'll be watching the clock there all right brother just come with me here the rapture firstly god bless you now as i am saying i think was it last week when we beam to you the photos of three do you know putin who is he all right now we'll come to predictions that we made you are so blessed if these things are in your heart and we'll come to those scriptures and it puts russia as the king of the north will show you these things right here and the bible says it is drying up for one reason and it is to open a way for the kings of east now these kings of east they are coming for the battle of armageddon for them the final battle so we'll follow them as they come now here it says and which we which we have them that are asleep [Music] we shall not prevent them and we which are alive amen now that's what the bible put it puts it like that it's addressing those that are asleep and we and we which are alive because it is one church but in different dimensions so that's why paul says where is it where is it thessalonians chapter four you listen to paul here you are saying paul is there you have you must watch the foreigners [Music] john was a foreigner and there's a forerunner again the bible puts that for runner as elijah we will put them in line we will see them because even john the bible says he will go before the lord in the spirit of elijah [Music] of your spirit will give you the scriptures in the spirit and the power of elijah and malacca four comes again and say behold i will send you elijah before the great and terrible day of the lord now when is that day before the terrible day is elijah again now [Music] so now that's how god used to this spirit and we have benefited spiritually and even the elijah was there on mount transfiguration who can read it quickly for me [Music] the mount transfiguration you find mount transfiguration where you find elijah moses elijah and christ on mount transfiguration you still have that scripture in your bibles you already can read it if you have it in your bible all right okay because you don't know you don't have it it says on one transfiguration they appear appeared moses elijah and christ amen they spoke of his disease in israel he will again appear there and the bible says now we follow that we follow that you haven't found all right you know what the bible says we should not just hear the word shaking that you you don't copy from another it should be from yourself even the word of god you should not copy from somebody it should be in you didn't the lord said at that day you shall know that i am in you and you in me [Music] the third pool that will give you rapture in faith is the pool that is within you the word of god that will give you the rapturing faith because it is divine now here we are let's start here with and we which are alive now we which are alive waiting for those that that are asleep the bible will put it to us like that we have the sixth dimension which those that are asleep are in the sixth dimension and we are here let me read to you a bit of these things [Music] you know this is the day when the books are opened amen and the one book called the book of life and we have also the lamb's book of life i'm looking for a book here before we continue but let's start here we which are alive we have indicated there that i don't know if you can see that now we have this a pyramid here you know in egypt we have pyramids even scientists they believe that it is the sign of enoch and enoch enoch the seventh man the bible says god took him away because he pleased god and you brother and sister you are living in the seventh age which you should please god and you will be raptured amen [Applause] that's how the bible puts it enough please the god and god took him away god was so happy when god becomes happy then he will take you away amen it is running from the beginning it runs from the beginning to the end in this book blasphemous name it runs from the beginning to the end it shows you seven steps to god [Music] do you know that there is seven steps to god now these steps are churches to god because god has only one church god don't have pieces of churches has one church and he's the head of that church and so now pyramid pyramid shows us the system and in this pyramid you have churches starting with affections to laudician church i think they are there but they are in the bible only this is to make things easier for us for us but we are going to read them in they are in the bible now now listen then in each church age we have what they call the overcomers church which is our time let us have revelation chapter 3 verse 21-22 my okay even as i also overcame and i sat down with my father it is unto the churches okay let me help also here he has read the scripture chapter 3 all right chapter 3 chapter 3 just give it to me i'm trying to run and i skip my scriptures to him that overcomers and church age we haven't read the whole thing if i start from verse 20 it says behold i stand at the door and knock our power the dog that is your heart if any man hear my voice he didn't say my gospel voice you hear the voice you will you will never come to god unless you hear his voice [Music] we can join church amen but still failing we come from different churches trying to find god in our distress we would change churches from this one to that one amen from faith mission to assemblies of god from this to that in search of something you know i'm told that god is like a diamond now with diamonds like this the diamond dickers they don't actually discover it as a diamond like that it's something dated with that it's covered with death like the same written [Music] the bible says she was a prostitute covered with death but because she was in the book of god at the appointed time god came to heaven [Music] until she said to the lord jesus christ i perceive you are a prophet and jesus said yes yes you know and from that time she was changed because she was predestinated to begin with she was not a prostitute but god has placed his seed in that woman god can change you even now if you open your heart to him he keeps on changing people we were all like drunkards we were drunkards we used to smoke we used to use drugs and so forth but he has changed us [Applause] not ourselves i couldn't change myself amen i couldn't be holy without him no man could can be holy but it is the holy god in amen amen so if you give your life to him he will change you amen amen don't try it yourself you can't change yourself but if you give yourself to him he will change you all right hey i'm trying to run this business here where's the scripture of mine again behold i stand at the door that is verse 20. that that's that's after he because on the day of judgment it's not you and your husband it's not you and your children it's you you'll stand there at the judgment your children will also stand at the judgment your wife will stand at the judgment industry [Music] you yourself should find god no one can find god for somebody else he's looking at your door even now that you should open the door then he comes in if you refuse him he won't force himself into you but he is going to judge you and unto the angel of the church of the logicians right this thing said the amen the faithful the true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that's verse 15 that thou art neither cold or hot i without cold or hot fish i mean you know lukewarm water you can no no man can enjoy looking water that is the bible do you have your bible now this is verse 17. because thou says i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing notice that no is not that thou art reached fire do you remember our story in lesotho we went to a place at the isiah who else uh this side because there's a type of an oven after they moved to these bricks they say whether it's calabash or whatever it has to go through the fire so they put it it comes through the oven and then now on the other side of the oven is it those who came through the oven now when we arrived there there was a lady there and we were looking at those who were supposed to go through the oven they were still on this side of the oven now we were saying yeah you are nice man nice how much is it mama and she said no no no no these ones have we not yet gone through the oven amen you can't be sure of the quality they must go through the fire just like the children of god the bible is easy god takes them through the fire for equality so we said in our word mama she led us to the other side of them and then she pointed to us those that came through the oven and they said to us if you want to buy you will buy from these ones not from these ones amen it goes according to the quality amen the children of god are equality they don't steal they don't swear they can kill they don't be rich they are not witches they are sons and daughters of god why they came through the fire of god and they become equality a christian true christian is equality hallelujah hey brother a true christian is a quality a high quality because he is just like his creator [Applause] for god said let us make many in our image now i'm told that the diamond if they achieve the diamonds they will never declare the diamond to be diamond until they see their reflections in that direction oh glory to god god will never call you his son until he sees himself in you [Applause] you should be a diamond that god would come and see himself that's when he will save my son my daughter and you can't say god to be your god until you see yourself in that diamond you see yourself in god before you can say i'm a child of god you are blind you are miserable that is their logician agent [Music] this is the age that we are living in people but want the riches until they kill people in order to make a sacrifice for riches they kill babies in order to make a sacrifice where are you going [Music] don't you fear god okay amen killing children just for money i'm told that all this shall pass away do you know that piece of a song of mine where will you be a hundred years from now will you be happy will you be safe i heard some young people singing thinking where are you they sing it like this where are you okay let me i'll end up singing instead of preaching they say where are you people who crucified the lord come and see progress in the work of the lord thinking that you would stop christianity in the work of the lord whom you crucified he came up on the third day and he said to john i was dead but am now alive forevermore and have the keys i'll read it to you here that he went and took the keys from satan he gave the king the key of the kingdom to peter and said peter i will give you the keys of the kingdom but there were still some keys which ones all right you don't know don't worry amen as long as i know because he says verse 19 as many as i love i rebuke and chase them therefore and repent amen are you devil worshippers therefore and repent you repent today the rapture is here now then he says leaving that church with that condition where they say we are rich we are in need of nothing he left them and now he said now behold i stand at the door if god comes to you you reject him he goes to another door if any man hear my voice and open the door you don't just hear the voice you open the door i will come in to him now you see the door is the heart now he wants you to open it then he says i will come into him amen god will never force himself into anybody because he knows that if you are predestinated you are just going to open up because you know him i will come into him and will stop with him you know that is the evening meal and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne that is in his kingdom his dominion he is inviting you to come and sit with him in his dominion then he says and it's like also overcame and and sat down with my father in his throne he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches now in this that is uh who are they and we which are alive we are waiting for them that are asleep yes because they are part of us and the bible says they sleep in jesus that's why they will return with him amen amen i shall not forget to say because lazarus is not that body amen you are promising your name now this body is not yours you are the bible says god like he wanted this robot to move and that's why they are trying to make some robots here and put signs in those robots you see this animated things that are killing our children yeah animation and so forth now our people are trying to take it from god because adam was made of the dust amen and when he was just a robot god came then the breath of life into him and he started to say hallelujah amen amen okay now brothers he that has an ear now don't touch this and say yeah lord i i have one here would you marry yourself let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that to him that over now in each of these ages we have the scriptures on the side there pointing to the overcomers of each age we won't read it today but you read it he doesn't overcome it he doesn't overcome it he doesn't overcome it amen because the army of god is made of overcomers no not churchgoers amen amen now as we are looking there uh you know i have a book blasphemous names i don't know if i've got it here but it's telling you all the same thing he is telling me of the same thing here it shows you that church ages constitute and make the bride some of that some out of that age some of that out of that age some of that age you know throughout the history has been coming up in a pyramid form you will see will bring a copy that shows that jerusalem is like a pyramid that's why we have it the church in the form of a pyramid now the pyramid or for enoch a sign in egypt i will come i will show you i will read it out of the bouquet that even the scientists they say today they can never never build something of that nature because and they say but the man responsible for that structure the measurements it is not from here that's why scientists cannot build a pyramid and the dimensions are in the pyramid until to where they say is the king's chamber and then when the prophet arrived and he saw that this pyramid it's a type of the church of god which is coming from ephesus in the book of revelation whom the lord has been taking out or putting aside [Music] you know i will read it in the uh the greatest battle ever fought that a god has been selecting there is a battle coming called the battle of armageddon it is here in the bible but after this we are going to follow down the better until the end because we are going to revelation chapter 20 where it will show us all these things [Music] no he said i will show you [Music] god spoke of abraham and he said shall i hide from abraham the thing that i do [Music] i'm so glad that god as the children of god you should know who you are where you come from where you are where you are going as a child of god amen so now as i'm reading here now we realize that at this five seven stages the bible says no man has seen god at any time because this pyramid speaks of time amen amen [Music] i went in i went westward to connect with the angel's message you will see that now and we which are alive amen our brothers is them that are asleep we are one but only they are in another dimension they have passed on to another dimension and we are going to meet very very soon let me read you something here those that are asleep we are going to meet them very soon here is the listen to this for runner i'll come and read to you about the forerunners the voice asked the voice asked voice would you like to see just beyond the kitten [Music] i answered it would help me so much you know a child of god they want to go to the moon they want to go to this they are speaking of going to mars [Music] amen and then now a child of god has also that spirit of exploration he wants to leave this body because his body is not your home when god made you everybody [Applause] you are not it will die [Music] the spirit left at the throne picked up the soul and picked up the bones put them together again that is the power of the almighty god don't worry about your bones and your body because on that day your spirit your soul on the day of resurrection will come the bible says do you have a scripture that says they came out of the graves only that i think you are still going to look for it yeah man what happened today nothing not the new bodies the very same god is in the graves you will never even lose your who was that because he knew that there will be a resurrection in jerusalem so he said take my bones with you so they were carrying the bones of this a man amen imagine when coming to a place and they are and now we are taking the bones to jerusalem because we will come and these bones will come back to life amen because the rapture is coming did you find it read it the temple already land in plain from the top to the bottom and the earth and the rocks went and the graves were opened and many bodies of the same switch left around and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto men amen can you salute god for that amen what happened he went up to the highest heaven after [Music] and the bible says because in the temple there was a veil that veiled the god and the people were wanting to see god they couldn't because of the veil but after i i resurrected [Music] and he came back again on the day of pentecost to indwell me and you we can now see god we cannot receive god and that very same power went into the graves it was the power coming from them [Music] uh when it was there the bones started to come together [Applause] hallelujah god bless you when the power was there you could see that movement in the graveyard that somebody is there they started to come together again and stand up again and walk amen amen amen that's why i cannot deprive myself of worshiping such a mighty god amen amen amen the power amen now he opened the temple first amen and the bible says now we have boldness [Applause] i'll read it to you hebrews he has opened the door for us amen that very same power straight to the graves and there go the bones the saints were not in the graves but they are booze [Music] amen god wouldn't uh create another bones he still wants to raise the old bones [Applause] when you are dead don't worry you are not dead even your bones you shall never lose your bones they open up [Music] the bones inside there [Music] flesh all gone that was dusty to dust but one that created power came down from off the throne of god that dust came together again and shaved the same person again for his soul to come and pick up the body and the bible says they came out now after picking their bodies and they walked into jerusalem [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] hey don't worry don't worry amen worry about those who are asleep because you'll meet them who are they i'm going to read it to you they and they are going to and the city amen so now these people have to come into jerusalem amen to say friends we are on our way we are just passing by and they came around him they confessed him they are images there look like a cloud amen and the bible said and then the way they said as you see him going that way he will come back the same way [Applause] because in coming back he'll be coming back with the saints from the sixth dimension [Music] i've seen my friends going here [Music] beloved like and there was a friend of mine before he passed on he came to my house not to name please but those who are familiar they know because it was my uh for the first time i heard him asking me for he did it then he said to me let us sing there's a land beyond the river amen that we call the sweet forever and then i wonder why is my friend today wanting us to sing this song then i realized when i was told that after that he has passed on he was seeing beyond the kitten of time and is then i understood why he wanted us to sing this especially this one [Music] amen amen i will also sing mine and this one amen when i come to the river at the ending of day one there'll be somebody waiting to show me the way i will know oh brother when i come to jordan amen there will be somebody there to show me the way across i won't have to cross alone amen [Applause] to the red sea there will be somebody there [Music] and god said to moses moses tell the children of israel to god for what and then he said what do you have in your eye what is that in your hand he had a rod and say use that rod open up your seat and moses hit the water and the sea open up and the children of israel walk on dry land amen when i come to the river at the ending of day when the last winds of sorrow has blown there'll be somebody waiting hallelujah i will have to [Applause] amen amen [Music] [Applause] [Music]
