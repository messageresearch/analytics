[28:22] a

[28:32] a
[28:33] place because when God direct us he will
[28:36] direct us in a
[28:38] place he said that one day Lord Moses
[28:42] said father can I see your
[28:45] glory and God said of course you can see

[1:39:39] woman meaning they believed on
[1:39:42] Jesus for their
[1:39:44] saying of the
[1:39:48] woman which testified
[1:39:51] he told
[1:39:53] me all that I ever

[1:47:54] up
[1:48:00] halfway now let me read we are going to
[1:48:05] read some things quickly
[1:48:08] here and now it
[1:48:12] says firstly and many more believed
[1:48:17] because of his word own word own
[1:48:25] meaning you have come here to hear the
[1:48:29] word of
[1:48:31] God but you should
[1:48:34] hear his
[1:48:36] [Music]
[1:48:39] own because everybody can talk about
[1:48:45] Jesus that's not
[1:48:48] salvation you should hear
[1:48:54] own
[1:48:56] word is that right
[1:48:59] amen and
[1:49:03] said listen I
[1:49:05] repeat and and they said unto the
[1:49:09] woman
[1:49:11] now we
[1:49:16] believe amen she could argue
[1:49:21] say all this time I have
[1:49:25] testified you you don't
[1:49:31] believe because when that
[1:49:35] word touch
[1:49:39] the it become
[1:49:44] different from the utterances of that
[1:49:49] woman
[1:49:51] amen when that
[1:49:54] word
[1:49:56] touch the inner
[1:50:01] man now they
[1:50:03] could
[1:50:07] differentiate that this now is not that
[1:50:14] woman we have
[1:50:19] arrived if you
[1:50:21] hear Brother testifying to
[1:50:25] you just Dash the
[1:50:31] door
[1:50:33] and you don't go back and
[1:50:38] say heard the word of God to you haven't
[1:50:40] yet heard
[1:50:43] him amen amen you've seen many
[1:50:48] people they will come to church because
[1:50:51] of testimony of
[1:50:55] somebody when somebody that somebody
[1:50:58] leaves the
[1:51:00] church they join up with
[1:51:07] that he
[1:51:09] becomes like the Demi
[1:51:14] God Amen let me read amen now the Bible
[1:51:19] says
[1:51:21] uh I will finish this one and
[1:51:25] said unto the
[1:51:27] woman
[1:51:29] now we
[1:51:34] believe all this time they were just
[1:51:42] listening
[1:51:43] until they
[1:51:45] could hear him
[1:51:48] themselves
[1:51:51] is then they
[1:51:52] said
[1:51:55] now I wonder if somebody
[1:51:58] today will say now I
[1:52:02] believe brother saw testif to
[1:52:08] me that that's the thing that in the
[1:52:11] long
[1:52:13] run it causes
[1:52:16] things because the people come to church
[1:52:20] sit in the church each and every one of
[1:52:24] them has his own man
[1:52:31] or I was testified to by
[1:52:41] Brother the real
[1:52:44] testimony it's when God speaks to
[1:52:48] you through this
[1:52:51] [Applause]
[1:52:54] brother that's the real
[1:53:00] one where's the
[1:53:03] king oh he's not here today yes okay
[1:53:07] amen all right let me carry
[1:53:11] on um now we
[1:53:14] believe not because of your
[1:53:18] saying
[1:53:20] for we have H him
[1:53:27] ourselves I wonder if
[1:53:30] somebody can
[1:53:35] say now I
[1:53:39] believe not of your
[1:53:44] testimony but I have heard
[1:53:48] him myself
[1:53:54] amen and they continue to say and you
[1:53:58] know
[1:54:00] that I have heard him my we have heard
[1:54:04] him
[1:54:06] ourselves and know that this is indeed
[1:54:10] the
[1:54:13] Christ the savior of the
[1:54:18] world a quick and short
[1:54:24] connection these people were
[1:54:28] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:54:30] the
[1:54:34] world
[1:54:36] predestinated and at at the appointed
[1:54:39] time if God has predestinated
[1:54:43] you surely he will visit
[1:54:48] you must finish his
[1:54:51] job he has called you amen so he must
[1:54:56] finish his
[1:54:58] job and and you become his Dwelling
[1:55:04] Place he has called you for a Dwelling
[1:55:08] Place he wants to live in
[1:55:12] you amen that's why he said let us make
[1:55:17] men our image
[1:55:20] [Applause]
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:22] that's why the secret of the seventh
[1:55:28] SE when the seven seal was
[1:55:32] open the
[1:55:36] seven that's right because when he
[1:55:39] arrived at
[1:55:42] 7 as brother says seven is always a
[1:55:48] mystery
[1:55:51] if you pass
[1:55:52] seven you must enter into something
[1:55:58] Supernatural in the
[1:56:00] book
[1:56:02] uh the future home future home
[1:56:08] says if you hit maybe I've got if you
[1:56:12] hit
[1:56:15] seven what are you going to
[1:56:17] do where are you going
[1:56:23] if you can
[1:56:26] worship and you don't hit
[1:56:30] seven you will worship and worship and
[1:56:38] worship without
[1:56:43] arriving and the
[1:56:47] people some people
[1:56:50] have failed to
[1:56:53] arrive because this thing goes
[1:56:57] like in the
[1:57:01] cycle if you are
[1:57:03] predestinated and you believe you will
[1:57:08] arrive because it is in a cycle of
[1:57:12] Eternity
[1:57:16] feeling you
[1:57:18] get
[1:57:21] today you see churches are
[1:57:24] full with the
[1:57:28] people that are
[1:57:36] halfway now we we want to

[2:05:26] as you can
[2:05:30] recognize is
[2:05:35] ET you know you know we have been
[2:05:38] squeezed
[2:05:41] now what I mean I'm not talking about
[2:05:44] the
[2:05:46] squeezing but I'm saying
[2:05:49] we are coming
[2:05:51] together the Eternal
[2:05:54] beings are now starting to come
[2:05:58] together because the time of the
[2:06:02] Rapture has
[2:06:06] come am in so much
[2:06:09] that I think I
[2:06:12] just slept for one
[2:06:17] hour and
[2:06:21] why
[2:06:24] because you know if you you are
[2:06:28] Eternal as the prophet
[2:06:31] says man is eternal as his
[2:06:37] maker you know if you are
[2:06:41] etal it's not even easy to
[2:06:47] sleep what I mean especially when the
[2:06:51] Rapture is so
[2:06:54] close there's something in
[2:06:57] you keeping you
[2:06:59] away because you are
[2:07:05] going the Bible says and
[2:07:08] Enoch the seventh
[2:07:10] man from Adam walked with
[2:07:15] God the people that are walking with God
[2:07:18] today
[2:07:20] they can't even
[2:07:26] sleep
[2:07:29] why you know that
[2:07:32] CH there is a big wheel turning in my
[2:07:37] heart there is a
[2:07:39] big turning in my heart how can you
[2:07:45] sleep if there's a will turning in your
[2:07:48] heart
[2:07:53] ET you can't even
[2:07:56] sleep because a person who works with
[2:08:00] God is not controlled by natural
[2:08:09] things let me tell you
[2:08:12] something I can be together with some
[2:08:15] other
[2:08:16] people chatting and
[2:08:22] but I end up Longing To
[2:08:32] Be amen amen because when I am
[2:08:36] alone I can talk with
[2:08:43] him that's when I'm
[2:08:46] alone and I feel the the touch of
[2:08:51] the you can hear rupture in
[2:08:55] you
[2:08:59] body the bed before it can take
[2:09:03] off there is that
[2:09:07] thing inside of that bed in the body in
[2:09:12] preparation for taking off how many have
[2:09:16] that today
[2:09:19] there's something in you in preparation
[2:09:23] for the
[2:09:27] rupture it's
[2:09:30] continuing just like
[2:09:33] that
[2:09:35] and that's why that's why we
[2:09:40] say I am never
[2:09:47] alone
[2:09:50] I hear people saying I'm so bored not
[2:09:53] the children of
[2:09:56] [Applause]
[2:09:58] God where is he when you are feeling
[2:10:03] B because his
[2:10:05] children can talk to
[2:10:12] him because there's somebody to talk
[2:10:17] to
[2:10:19] they not
[2:10:21] checking we they are not checking how
[2:10:24] much they have
[2:10:26] done they
[2:10:29] own

[2:10:44] things of the
[2:10:46] world he not on
[2:10:55] the
[2:10:57] uh you should have
[2:11:00] seen
[2:11:03] Enoch how he
[2:11:07] changed when he
[2:11:13] started to
[2:11:17] walk with
[2:11:20] God Walking with
[2:11:25] God can you walk with
[2:11:30] God Amen all
