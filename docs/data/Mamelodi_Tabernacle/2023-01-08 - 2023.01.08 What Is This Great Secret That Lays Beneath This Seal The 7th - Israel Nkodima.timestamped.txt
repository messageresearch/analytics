[1:29:02] amen amen
[1:29:05] [Music]
[1:29:08] opening of the
[1:29:11] of the
[1:29:12] the seventh
[1:29:18] and what the Bible says what happened
[1:29:20] one day and there was silence a bit of a
[1:29:24] space of half an hour
[1:29:26] uh in heaven
[1:29:29] meaning the activity is
[1:29:39] as we were looking even last time
[1:29:44] that even the angels stop their
[1:29:49] happiness
[1:29:53] when there was such an activity
[1:30:00] they were looking at things that the
[1:30:04] Lord was saying even the heavens itself
[1:30:09] is coming down
[1:30:13] and
[1:30:18] well
[1:30:20] the Bible says
[1:30:22] and Revelation chapter 21
[1:30:27] it shows the new
[1:30:29] Heaven and the new age
[1:30:34] and it tells us about the Tabernacle of
[1:30:37] God with me
[1:30:47] in his
[1:30:53] will be with us
[1:30:56] amen amen all right
[1:31:01] I don't think it is frightening to say
[1:31:03] God will be with us
[1:31:09] amen
[1:31:10] you know when the lamp opened the book
[1:31:13] before even he opened it
[1:31:17] he took the book
[1:31:19] it says from him that said
[1:31:24] he had the book on the writing
[1:31:28] because the children of God
[1:31:31] are the right-hand people
[1:31:35] because all the Mysteries came down
[1:31:38] they're like
[1:31:42] amen amen and so now that's why there
[1:31:47] was John said there was a jubilee
[1:31:54] the one with you
[1:31:56] he was waited to take the books
[1:32:03] amen
[1:32:06] and because an angel came
[1:32:10] when no one was founded
[1:32:14] to open the title
[1:32:18] and the angel came and said
[1:32:22] Revelation chapter 5 brother verse 1.
[1:32:26] okay amen
[1:32:30] and they sang a song
[1:32:40] so that's why together
[1:32:43] we as human beings forgiveness
[1:32:52] we ought to be the people who really
[1:32:56] would look into the world
[1:33:01] and seeing what he has done for us
[1:33:17] when no one was
[1:33:24] there is one
[1:33:28] age
[1:33:31] when the Forerunner saw him
[1:33:34] he said
[1:33:39] that taketh away the sinners
[1:33:44] that was a John he released
[1:33:48] on the banks of Jordan
[1:33:52] This John also what happened when asked
[1:33:57] who are you
[1:33:59] said I am the one the voice of one okay
[1:34:09] so this way to one was introduced you're
[1:34:12] only one
[1:34:15] I mean when John introduced him
[1:34:18] healthy also introduced himself
[1:34:22] amen amen I am the one The Voice
[1:34:27] verse chapter 40.
[1:34:30] I Am The Voice one crying in the world
[1:34:36] make straight The Way of the World
[1:34:40] amen amen now John like an eagle
[1:34:46] by the river of Jordan
[1:34:50] he was there looking around
[1:34:54] expecting
[1:34:57] the way she wanted
[1:35:01] amen amen that's why today
[1:35:05] we are the sons and daughters
[1:35:09] because of that word
[1:35:15] Revelation chapter 5 verse 1.
[1:35:18] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:35:21] said on the throne a book written within
[1:35:24] and on the back side sealed with Seven
[1:35:26] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[1:35:29] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:35:32] worthy to open the book and to lose the
[1:35:35] souls thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[1:35:38] in Earth never under the Earth was able
[1:35:41] to open the book never to look there on
[1:35:45] and I wept much because no man was found
[1:35:48] wealthy to open and to read the book
[1:35:51] neither to look there on and one of the
[1:35:54] elders said unto me whip not Behold The
[1:35:57] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[1:36:00] David has prevailed to open the book and
[1:36:03] to lose the souls thereof
[1:36:06] amen amen
[1:36:08] you know
[1:36:11] how many do you know that there was a
[1:36:13] battle in heaven
[1:36:18] the things started there
[1:36:21] sin started there
[1:36:25] Rebellion started there
[1:36:29] um
[1:36:32] when Lucifer hello Lucifer started that
[1:36:36] battle
[1:36:37] and uh Michael yeah cast him down
[1:36:43] Lucifer in his angels
[1:36:46] down to the Earth
[1:36:51] there was this man
[1:36:54] who has placed there
[1:36:57] as the god of the Earth
[1:37:03] Adam
[1:37:05] So Adam Adam he says headquarters was
[1:37:09] called the Garden of Eden
[1:37:13] because Eden Eden was the headquarters
[1:37:17] of God
[1:37:19] the headquarters
[1:37:23] but the Garden of Eden
[1:37:27] edging was the headquarters
[1:37:35] and when
[1:37:37] Lucifer was cast down
[1:37:41] and he came to Eden Eddie
[1:37:45] that's when he started
[1:37:48] the same battles
[1:37:51] and started and continue
[1:37:56] he continued actually right now on Earth
[1:38:03] rebelling against God
[1:38:05] even this morning it is
[1:38:10] uh
[1:38:12] the Lord Jesus called him the prince of
[1:38:16] this world yeah
[1:38:23] and so forth
[1:38:25] but then fella no one was worthy to
[1:38:29] fight him um yes
[1:38:42] the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ God
[1:38:45] himself
[1:38:48] to the form actually
[1:38:51] of a warrior
[1:38:55] amen amen
[1:38:57] but he is
[1:39:05] righteousness
[1:39:07] and he came
[1:39:10] armed with his words

[1:39:58] is there someone out of that amen now
[1:40:03] yes sir because it was just silence
[1:40:10] amen amen
[1:40:12] can you preach amen out of that
[1:40:16] yes sir yes but it says
[1:40:19] in heaven
[1:40:21] foreign
[1:40:36] I think last we went through that
[1:40:42] here on Earth
[1:40:44] there was activities
[1:41:05] let us look into this
[1:41:08] uh
[1:41:11] we will see even the this
[1:41:15] eternal beings
[1:41:19] the people but
[1:41:22] whom God has ordained
[1:41:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:41:30] amen amen and they are here
[1:41:36] and now we we're starting with this
[1:41:39] Revelation chapter seven meaning
[1:41:47] uh what is this great
[1:41:51] secrets that lays beneath the seal says
[1:42:01] meaning if it is
[1:42:09] amen amen and what is that great secret
[1:42:16] all the seals when they are they are
[1:42:19] open you see something
[1:42:22] but this one you don't see
[1:42:27] amen amen then I'm looking at my books
[1:42:32] here
[1:42:33] you know the spoken word
[1:42:38] is the original seat he the spoken word
[1:42:41] is the original seat amen it sees it
[1:42:44] says
[1:42:46] but I will start here
[1:42:48] when Abraham met him
[1:42:53] he was Melchizedek
[1:43:00] he unfolds to hear what all the
[1:43:03] attributes will do in the Final End is
[1:43:06] amen
[1:43:24] so uh king of Salem Illinois
[1:43:31] Abraham when he looked for a city
[1:43:34] the king
[1:43:37] Melchizedek now that is the kingdom of
[1:43:40] Melchizedek
[1:43:43] the Bible says without father
[1:43:46] without mothers
[1:43:50] but yes
[1:44:10] that's why if you read in the book
[1:44:12] chapter one of Revelation
[1:44:16] foreign
[1:44:53] yes I am Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:44:57] and the ending says the Lord which is
[1:45:00] and which was and which is to come
[1:45:03] Almighty amen now a lot of you must say
[1:45:06] uh listen carefully uh
[1:45:11] it doesn't start with
[1:45:14] Words
[1:45:18] which is amen
[1:45:23] which is
[1:45:27] foreign
[1:45:46] [Applause]
[1:46:01] so you you start with the God who is is
[1:46:16] still the same one
[1:46:18] and get to know about the one who's to
[1:46:21] come
[1:46:22] as when you know the one who is
[1:46:27] amen amen you can't wait for the one to
[1:46:30] come when you don't know
[1:46:45] amen because you've known the one who is
[1:46:49] that's why the Bible says take him and
[1:46:53] find him
[1:46:56] amen amen you seek him he says
[1:47:05] amen amen don't just attend the church
[1:47:09] the calling is not to the church
[1:47:13] to him
[1:47:16] you'll find him you have found life
[1:47:20] he said he who finds me
[1:47:23] finds life
[1:47:27] amen amen the person you must fight
[1:47:35] you should fight
[1:47:38] sometimes we find the things in state of
[1:47:40] him
[1:47:43] we find things about Jesus
[1:47:49] amen amen all right
[1:47:53] you know
[1:47:55] that's why there's difference between
[1:47:57] religion and the Christians
[1:48:03] religion is just all about God
[1:48:10] that's why the world is littered with
[1:48:13] religions
[1:48:21] you go there
[1:48:23] Jesus
[1:48:25] but where he is
[1:48:29] and then he said or he who finds me a
[1:48:33] question
[1:48:35] finds life
[1:48:39] all right amen he never said he who
[1:48:42] finds my system yeah
[1:48:45] or he will find my church is
[1:48:57] all right let's finish with this guy now
[1:49:01] I read one pattern
[1:49:03] you know Abraham Abraham did you know
[1:49:07] the Bible Galatians chapter 3 says
[1:49:11] speaks of us being the Seed of Abraham
[1:49:16] now the Seed of Abraham
[1:49:21] this Seed of Abraham
[1:49:24] is the seed that has met melchized amen
[1:49:31] foreign
[1:50:21] it was a man
[1:50:25] that man
[1:50:29] in the house
[1:50:35] but he was a man
[1:50:39] foreign
[1:50:46] amen
[1:51:01] you know when God comes to you
[1:51:04] he doesn't come to you in the flesh
[1:51:09] he comes to your hearts
[1:51:12] where there is so
[1:51:17] amen amen did you know that do you know
[1:51:20] what is theophy now that's what you're
[1:51:22] funny
[1:51:24] do you know theophied
[1:51:27] all right now when God comes to you
[1:51:31] like melchized
[1:51:39] how can he come to you
[1:51:52] then he can only come to such a person
[1:51:55] who
[1:52:01] Adam Adam
[1:52:04] there is
[1:52:09] the
[1:52:13] the breath of life into Adam the body
[1:52:22] otherwise Adam would have remained a
[1:52:26] statute
[1:52:30] and some people would even pay some
[1:52:33] money to go and watch the stage
[1:52:41] amen amen
[1:52:43] because man is a spirit yeah
[1:52:48] and then
[1:52:51] God
[1:52:52] if you rewind hey oh well I'm around
[1:52:56] you'll find that God
[1:52:59] the Bible says God is a spirit
[1:53:03] and the true worshipers
[1:53:07] shall worship him
[1:53:09] in the church
[1:53:13] our
[1:53:14] when in spirit in spirit
[1:53:18] because God is
[1:53:21] a spirit amen the true worshipers
[1:53:25] meaning there's false worships
[1:53:31] shall worship Him
[1:53:33] in spirit that cherish for God is a
[1:53:37] spirit
[1:53:38] now that's why if we go back
[1:53:41] is God the spirit
[1:53:44] and out of the experience
[1:53:48] logos after all the logos
[1:53:53] amen you see that's how God did things
[1:54:02] I'll see you
[1:54:05] I know that
[1:54:08] when my if I were to
[1:54:11] to die
[1:54:15] if I were to die and
[1:54:20] it's not me who will die
[1:54:23] give me work
[1:54:27] you see I mean that's why Jesus Christ
[1:54:31] so when
[1:54:34] they threatened him
[1:54:37] the Bible he said to them
[1:54:41] destroy this boy
[1:54:46] because they couldn't destroy him
[1:54:50] destroyed this boy
[1:54:54] but you come to see on the third day
[1:54:58] I will raise this amen
[1:55:03] amen yes sir and on the first day
[1:55:10] they came to the Sea separate but of
[1:55:14] course
[1:55:20] as he has spoken
[1:55:24] now they didn't understand him when he
[1:55:27] said he had destroyed this step
[1:55:33] because they couldn't kill God
[1:55:37] amen he offered them the Tabernacles
[1:55:42] because it could bleed
[1:55:46] but he himself
[1:55:54] [Applause]
[1:55:55] when he offered them the Tabernacles
[1:56:02] his blood is not in godima is
[1:56:15] Joseph was sent aside
[1:56:19] that day it is the time of God
[1:56:23] then when God when Gabriel came
[1:56:51] and became
[1:56:56] that's why the blood of Jesus
[1:56:59] if you have you've got your Revelation
[1:57:02] that means you have received the word of
[1:57:06] God
[1:57:12] and now it is
[1:57:19] by the Revelation the word of God the
[1:57:24] way that created
[1:57:25] amen amen so the blood of Jesus
[1:57:56] oh God
[1:57:58] you know the blood of God
[1:58:00] amen amen yes sir so now surely if the
[1:58:05] word of God
[1:58:06] you've got the Revelation
[1:58:09] that is the the blood in you amen
[1:58:13] the blood of God
[1:58:16] he's saying the chemical
[1:58:19] amen that's why he married
[1:58:23] after he said be it unto me
[1:58:27] according to you
[1:58:34] you know uh with him
[1:58:41] it will be Let It Be
[1:58:44] according to our relationship
[1:58:51] she could say that
[1:58:54] um
[1:59:02] I cannot I can't just have a baby
[1:59:07] unless
[1:59:09] if it is according to our relationships
[1:59:18] be it unto me
[1:59:20] according to you
[1:59:26] amen that is the relationship
[1:59:30] that brought a son
[1:59:33] this son the blood is the word
[1:59:38] and the word
[1:59:40] materialize
[1:59:42] and it was blood yeah
[1:59:46] that's why I can't start the church
[1:59:49] [Music]
[1:59:56] because the blood started the change
[2:00:01] he said I shall build my church
[2:00:09] that rock is the Revelation
[2:00:12] is that right amen
[2:00:17] shall not Prevail against him amen
[2:00:26] you know the battle started there he
[2:00:28] tried it for me
[2:00:30] today it is called the battle of
[2:00:32] armagedy
[2:00:35] well Lucifer is

[2:01:04] yeah
[2:01:05] those Angelic beings

[2:02:18] part and then we are going to our
[2:02:21] scriptures

[2:02:28] white horse and he that said upon him
[2:02:31] was called faithful and true
[2:02:33] and in righteousness he don't judge and
[2:02:36] make war

[2:02:40] his head were many crowns and he had a
[2:02:43] name written that no man knew but he
[2:02:46] himself
[2:02:47] and he was clothed with a Vesta dipped
[2:02:50] in Blood and his name is called the word
[2:02:52] of God hey

[2:16:26] let's go back there
[2:16:29] Revelation 12 verse 10 to 12.
[2:16:32] and I had a lot of voice saying in
[2:16:35] heaven now this comes salvation and
[2:16:38] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[2:16:41] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[2:16:44] of our preference is cast down which
[2:16:46] accused them before our God day and
[2:16:48] night and they overcame him by the blood
[2:16:52] of the lamb and by the weight of their
[2:16:54] testimony and they have brought their
[2:16:57] lives unto the death
[2:16:58] therefore rejoicing heavens and he that
[2:17:01] dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of
[2:17:04] the earth and of the sea for the Devil
[2:17:07] is come down unto you having great rest
[2:17:10] because he knoweth that he have a short

[2:18:01] the word of the Prophet
[2:18:04] the underworld
[2:18:06] where where is Satan
[2:18:12] when the Lord died
[2:18:15] he went down
[2:18:19] where was Satan
[2:18:24] where
[2:18:26] if you let the Lord went to hell
[2:18:30] because hell was not burning
[2:18:34] hell is going to bend
[2:18:37] add the judgment
[2:18:41] after the Judgment then the fire
[2:18:46] even water will burn
[2:18:51] okay
[2:18:53] where is Satan now
[2:18:57] he said quarters
[2:19:00] the Bible says
[2:19:03] when when Jesus
[2:19:06] when he died
[2:19:09] he said
[2:19:11] father receive my
[2:19:14] my spirit
[2:19:18] because it is the spirit
[2:19:21] their soul the body
[2:19:25] so the body went to the Grave
[2:19:30] amen but the spirit he said father
[2:19:34] receive my spirit and the soul went away
[2:19:41] foreign
[2:19:43] to take Abraham
[2:19:47] job and all those things
[2:19:51] amen
[2:19:53] so because they were in a place called
[2:19:58] Paradise
[2:19:59] so he arrived there
[2:20:03] and then when the Bible says the the the
[2:20:08] the the graves
[2:20:10] were opened
[2:20:13] amen he was coming back

[2:20:34] then he was taken with them
[2:20:37] to the sixth dimension
[2:20:40] [Applause]
[2:20:42] that's why
[2:20:44] that man on the cross
[2:20:47] said Lord Lord remember me
[2:20:49] when you enter your kingdom and he said
[2:20:53] tonight

[2:24:33] text
[2:24:36] yeah
[2:24:37] now
[2:24:40] you know my text is this one
[2:24:48] this body
[2:24:50] is subject
[2:24:52] through the word of God
[2:24:56] I tell you that
[2:24:59] if in heaven
[2:25:02] silence
[2:25:03] the activity
[2:25:12] now we look we look at this
[2:25:17] you know
[2:25:18] um
[2:25:20] things
[2:25:21] are changing now
[2:25:24] for you to be taken up in the rapture
[2:25:29] God is not just coming to take me
[2:25:34] and you'll see me jackets flying
[2:25:38] amen
[2:25:40] has been taken in the rapture
[2:25:44] no
[2:25:45] God is not dealing with us like that
[2:25:49] but I want to say
[2:25:51] you must know the in closing
[2:25:55] at theophany
[2:25:57] this body
[2:25:59] what is subject to the word
[2:26:05] that's why there's no theology with God
[2:26:10] no it's Christianity
[2:26:13] [Applause]
[2:26:15] amen yeah so
[2:26:19] now Christianity
[2:26:22] as I am told
[2:26:25] it is that God
[2:26:29] is in you
[2:26:33] for he said at that day you shall know
[2:26:34] that
[2:26:35] I I am
[2:26:37] in you I don't know if
[2:26:44] if ever you have arrived at that day
[2:26:48] because at that day
[2:26:51] which day
[2:26:53] when they're three-fold
[2:26:56] The Mystery of the free food
[2:27:00] revelation of God
[2:27:04] as the father
[2:27:07] it was a god
[2:27:11] the spirit
[2:27:12] the logos and then
[2:27:18] all right when the witch comes it will
[2:27:21] have it will flush
[2:27:24] in that three-fold only
[2:27:28] the people who will hear is part of that
[2:27:32] threefold
[2:27:34] threefold and that day you shall know
[2:27:38] that is do you know
[2:27:43] because he said that day you shall know
[2:27:45] that I am in the father
[2:27:48] and you in me and I in you
[2:27:54] one
[2:27:56] it's one thing in a three-fold
[2:28:01] oh God now when the word is spoken it
[2:28:04] will flush through that free food
[2:28:08] amen those who will hear are part of the
[2:28:12] threefold
[2:28:13] amen only God can
[2:28:17] believe his word
[2:28:20] and every person who believes this word
[2:28:23] is part of God
[2:28:27] all right
[2:28:28] if I'm not part of God I cannot hear his
[2:28:32] way
[2:28:34] I hear about
[2:28:37] I don't hear him
[2:28:39] but if you are part of the threefold you
[2:28:43] hear him not about him
[2:28:48] you see the difference
[2:28:49] people hear about God
[2:28:53] if one comes and says God is this
[2:28:56] he says oh yeah yeah and another one
[2:28:59] said no no no no no no God is this but a
[2:29:02] Christian do not hear about God
[2:29:06] he hears God
[2:29:11] that's the difference
[2:29:15] you want to hear about God or you want
[2:29:17] to hear God
[2:29:23] do you want to hear God
[2:29:26] or you want to hear about God
[2:29:29] that is called religion
[2:29:34] then you become religious
[2:29:37] but if you hear God
[2:29:40] you are a Christian
[2:29:42] [Applause]
[2:29:46] people hear about God
[2:29:48] by they continue doing their own things
[2:29:52] because they have never heard God
[2:29:56] they hear about
[2:30:00] um
[2:30:01] now listen
[2:30:04] ethio funny
[2:30:07] is a body
[2:30:09] uh
[2:30:11] subject
[2:30:14] to the weight
[2:30:19] all right
[2:30:22] that means
[2:30:26] uh
[2:30:27] when God comes to you
[2:30:32] he comes to this inner men
[2:30:40] this Inner Man
[2:30:42] which has no father
[2:30:45] no mother
[2:30:47] no beginning of days
[2:30:50] that's the inner men
[2:30:53] that's why
[2:30:55] it says I was reading from this book
[2:30:58] here
[2:31:01] you need to meet melchizedeka
[2:31:08] but
[2:31:09] if milk is a dick
[2:31:11] has got no father no mother no beginning
[2:31:15] of days
[2:31:16] now the only being that he can meet
[2:31:21] is a being that has no father
[2:31:24] no mother no beginning of days no ending
[2:31:28] of days

[2:32:55] beginning
[2:32:56] our body has a beginning I was born
[2:33:01] amen but being born of God is not being
[2:33:06] born of a woman
[2:33:07] because who is born of a woman has got
[2:33:11] but few days
[2:33:15] that is this body
[2:33:17] born of the woman
[2:33:20] and this body has got about few days
[2:33:25] it comes
[2:33:27] dies
[2:33:29] but inside

[2:34:15] housing
[2:34:17] foreign
[2:34:19] drops
[2:34:30] now now listen closing the Rapture is
[2:34:34] coming
[2:34:35] how it is coming
[2:34:38] is for the
[2:34:39] Spirit men
[2:34:43] for the Bible says we shall we shall
[2:34:48] changes
[2:34:52] this body

[2:36:01] I'm looking at the things for the last
[2:36:03] time

[2:37:04] no
[2:37:06] that is what she says
[2:37:10] even if I don't see it that way
[2:37:14] because even the Bible says don't say
[2:37:16] tomorrow I'll do this and that and that
[2:37:19] say the Lord willing
[2:37:24] you will do that

[2:38:04] I don't know maybe it is my my mind is
[2:38:07] weak or what but I don't see any future
[2:38:12] no I only see the coming of the Lord
[2:38:15] in the in the Rapture that is what I'm
[2:38:19] looking at
[2:38:20] that's why if you find me at home I'm
[2:38:24] just reading the word of God
[2:38:27] amen I don't mind spending overnight

[2:40:13] Bible said God said to them
[2:40:16] my word has no place in you
[2:40:22] you see
[2:40:24] okay
[2:40:25] we we believed that
[2:40:28] the gospel
[2:40:30] is when
[2:40:32] I go around
[2:40:36] I don't know my time I don't know my
[2:40:40] type just put my time here so that I can
[2:40:42] close

[2:41:29] no
[2:41:31] okay
[2:41:32] I
[2:41:34] yeah I asked for times for my time
[2:41:38] I asked for my time here
[2:41:41] it's all right so that I can
[2:41:44] be directed
[2:41:46] uh I don't want to
[2:41:50] carry on reading
[2:41:53] now listen
[2:41:56] the last thing that we have
[2:42:00] is to meet Melchizedek
[2:42:05] yeah that's good that's good
[2:42:08] that's good now I know
[2:42:11] I'm left a few minutes here
[2:42:15] what do you need I quote
[2:42:18] is to meet
[2:42:20] this milk is a deck
[2:42:24] after this seal is open
[2:42:34] under this
[2:42:37] seventh seal
[2:42:39] the activity there
[2:42:41] is milky of Melchizedek now that's why
[2:42:46] you know if you come to the pyramid
[2:42:49] you find the seven steps to the king's
[2:42:53] chamber
[2:42:54] amen but did you know that the church is
[2:42:58] viewed the bride is beyond that
[2:43:01] because seven steps is seven churches
[2:43:07] but now uh
[2:43:10] where we are now we are even beyond the
[2:43:15] seventh Church age
[2:43:18] [Music]
[2:43:20] didn't we read those things
[2:43:23] we did
[2:43:24] all right we are beyond that
[2:43:30] we
[2:43:32] are Beyond
[2:43:34] the seventh
[2:43:36] back to Eternity because the Bible says
[2:43:41] uh those who believe in him
[2:43:45] have eternal life
[2:43:49] now
[2:43:50] eternal life
[2:43:51] you are not going to act eternal life
[2:43:55] but as being born of God
[2:43:59] you have eternal
[2:44:01] now a person with eternal life has got
[2:44:05] no father no mother
[2:44:07] no beginning of days no ending of days
[2:44:12] amen
[2:44:15] that's why
[2:44:18] um
[2:44:29] I can be ancestral
[2:44:32] because I have because I've got
[2:44:37] eternal life
[2:44:38] a person who's got eternal life
[2:44:41] you don't need to ask him
[2:44:44] his life tells it all
[2:44:47] [Applause]
[2:44:50] he is not of this world
[2:44:54] his home is far away
[2:44:56] [Applause]
[2:44:58] he is a pilgrim a soldier
[2:45:01] looking for a city
[2:45:04] a city to come
[2:45:06] like the bride of Christ
[2:45:08] there she is a queen
[2:45:12] now this woman called the bride of
[2:45:15] Christ he's a she's a queen
[2:45:18] now look how she's preparing herself now
[2:45:22] amen you're not going to take that
[2:45:25] position
[2:45:27] already she's working towards that
[2:45:31] you know if you are told that you are a
[2:45:34] son of God
[2:45:36] and that the Lord is coming you'll be
[2:45:39] waking towards that
[2:45:41] amen as a son that's why it says when he
[2:45:45] appeared you will be like him
[2:45:48] will you be waking towards that and the
[2:45:52] more you come closer you the more you
[2:45:56] look like
[2:45:56] [Applause]
[2:46:02] amen
[2:46:04] is also like you yeah
[2:46:11] did you know that
[2:46:13] what you need
[2:46:15] is to meet this Melchizedek
[2:46:20] that's what you need now
[2:46:25] he's not a he's not flesh
[2:46:30] is not flesh
[2:46:31] that's melchized
[2:46:33] King
[2:46:35] of Salem
[2:46:36] that's why I was trying to bring that
[2:46:42] but I was stopped to come here
[2:46:45] this King
[2:46:47] Melchizedek
[2:46:49] who Abraham met
[2:46:53] for he looked for a city
[2:46:58] and he met him well
[2:47:03] [Music]
[2:47:07] at the literals please spot
[2:47:12] where
[2:47:13] the city will come
[2:47:17] because the city is coming there
[2:47:27] [Music]
[2:47:35] now this came to your family
[2:47:38] is the king of my favorite
[2:47:43] and is the king of your family
[2:47:48] he is the one who met Abraham
[2:47:52] about you when he met Abraham
[2:47:55] he was a man
[2:48:00] is what confused
[2:48:03] God coming to them as a man
[2:48:06] [Music]
[2:48:08] that's what confused the Jews
[2:48:12] God coming to them as a man
[2:48:17] is that right
[2:48:18] okay
[2:48:20] no
[2:48:22] lastly
[2:48:24] that's why
[2:48:27] if I go back to the Bible
[2:48:30] you realize that
[2:48:32] this man
[2:48:34] who came
[2:48:36] that is God who took the form of man
[2:48:41] because there was no man
[2:48:46] eligible oh
[2:48:48] to open the book
[2:48:52] amen
[2:48:54] why we are like we are this what we are
[2:48:57] today
[2:48:58] it is because the book has been opened
[2:49:05] their whole
[2:49:07] hey
[2:49:09] all the sons of God
[2:49:14] even John
[2:49:16] cried we
[2:49:18] when there was no one with you
[2:49:22] to open the book
[2:49:25] and reveal the seals
[2:49:29] John wept
[2:49:32] that's why
[2:49:35] we need to be we are
[2:49:38] called the right-hand people
[2:49:41] because it says I saw in the right hand
[2:49:44] chapter 5.
[2:49:46] since revelation
[2:49:50] the right hand of him that said
[2:49:54] on the throne
[2:49:56] a book
[2:49:58] written Within
[2:50:00] and on the back side
[2:50:04] inside within and on the back side
[2:50:10] amen
[2:50:12] now
[2:50:15] there were seals that were in the book
[2:50:20] they were revealed
[2:50:24] by the angel messenger
[2:50:26] but on the back side
[2:50:31] you
[2:50:32] you I I will read to you some things
[2:50:34] here
[2:50:36] because it says
[2:50:38] these things happened before the
[2:50:40] foundation of the world
[2:50:43] or these are called the back side
[2:50:49] that's why it says
[2:50:53] the ministry has called us to our secret
[2:50:58] pastors
[2:51:03] where are you from
[2:51:06] now who are you
[2:51:07] where are you going
[2:51:12] you see now the book shows
[2:51:15] and the song it is that is Revelation
[2:51:19] chapter 5.
[2:51:21] I saw in the in the
[2:51:25] right hand
[2:51:27] then because the mysteries of God
[2:51:30] job says
[2:51:32] they are on the right
[2:51:36] that's why you as the children of God
[2:51:39] you are the right-hand people
[2:51:44] amen where the Mysteries are performed
[2:51:50] on there you can go to the left
[2:51:53] you will only find a Miracles wonders
[2:51:56] and so forth
[2:51:58] and the Lord will tell you that they
[2:52:01] shall arise
[2:52:04] false prophets and so forth and they
[2:52:08] shall perform
[2:52:09] wonders
[2:52:11] is so much if it were possible
[2:52:16] they would even deceive even the elect
[2:52:22] but it is not possible because the elect
[2:52:27] amen looks
[2:52:32] don't look for miracles and wonders
[2:52:37] no I mean they are not looking for that
[2:52:41] because why
[2:52:44] why if if there's a miracle to be
[2:52:46] performed
[2:52:49] and you asked I was with brother my city
[2:52:53] is here
[2:52:54] when I told that Pastor from Cameroon
[2:52:58] that your mother
[2:53:00] you will find your mother here
[2:53:04] yes
[2:53:06] then when I prayed
[2:53:09] he asked a brother to take to record my
[2:53:13] prayer
[2:53:15] while praying for
[2:53:17] he had just received a message from
[2:53:19] Cameroon
[2:53:21] his mother is sick
[2:53:25] and he said to me would you pray for my
[2:53:29] mother I said yes sure
[2:53:31] knowing that he will be here
[2:53:38] and because his mother
[2:53:41] foreign
[2:54:00] if you are sick here we just pray and
[2:54:05] then you are healed
[2:54:09] but if we want
[2:54:10] [Applause]
[2:54:12] uh if we want to play games
[2:54:15] then I'll be standing here the whole day
[2:54:19] you in the future

[2:54:24] amen talking
[2:54:27] you know I can surprise you
[2:54:36] but
[2:54:38] I just said to the pastor you'll find
[2:54:41] your mother very well
[2:54:44] I think brother my city told you last
[2:54:47] time
[2:54:48] that before she even he even arrived
[2:54:52] from he was told your mother is healed
[2:54:56] amen
[2:55:00] why
[2:55:03] the Miracles wonders
[2:55:06] was not something that God has sent for
[2:55:09] us to display Miracles and so forth no
[2:55:13] what he has sent is the way again
[2:55:18] [Applause]
[2:55:19] and the weight is a Healer
[2:55:26] amen
[2:55:27] if I can say to you like I said your
[2:55:32] mother you'll find your mother healed
[2:55:34] that is the way
[2:55:37] because I take it from him
[2:55:40] that by his stripes

[2:56:06] here if you receive this way if you can
[2:56:10] receive this word you are healed
