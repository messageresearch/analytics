[1:49:39] the foundation of the world

[1:50:12] and
[1:50:13] read
[1:50:15] but
[1:50:16] we are going to
[1:50:18] start from the side of
[1:50:20] the seventh
[1:50:22] seal
[1:51:03] is
[1:51:58] that is some time ago
[1:52:27] because this is the new world order
[1:52:30] thing
[1:52:33] new world order
[1:52:38] you listen to your prophets
[1:52:42] nothing will
[1:52:56] even death
[1:53:08] uh
[1:53:09] i'm going to this scripture
[1:53:13] and
[1:53:14] we believe that god will help us
[1:53:19] brother i'm trying to figure out here
[1:53:21] what what was this for
[1:53:24] the world
[1:53:35] all right
[1:53:37] to our bibles
[1:53:42] we i will start by reading from
[1:53:46] revelation chapter eight verse one
[1:53:49] tomorrow
[1:53:50] morning
[1:53:54] a scripture
[1:53:55] that says
[1:53:57] nothing to the people but they're saying
[1:53:59] something to the bride
[1:54:05] okay
[1:54:06] you know if you are going to
[1:54:09] talk to the to us you are funny
[1:54:18] because you are in the terms of the
[1:54:20] supernatural
[1:54:48] in heaven
[1:55:02] and
[1:55:23] let's start by reading
[1:55:25] this
[1:55:26] revelation chapter 8 verse 1 amen
[1:55:30] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[1:55:33] there was silence in heaven about the
[1:55:35] space of half an hour
[1:55:48] our heavenly father
[1:55:51] here we come again lord
[1:55:54] at this point in time
[1:55:56] we have
[1:55:58] the brethren in here
[1:56:01] and we have pastors in here
[1:56:05] the shepherds
[1:56:06] and we are so glad
[1:56:09] that
[1:56:10] you are here with us amen
[1:56:13] lord they were
[1:56:15] again the devils were trying to spoil
[1:56:19] but yet we knew that
[1:56:21] you are here with us
[1:56:24] yes and you are going to take the
[1:56:26] service throughout
[1:56:29] until everybody will leave this place
[1:56:32] singing jesus is lord
[1:56:35] father as you said we should fear
[1:56:38] nothing
[1:56:39] and we don't fear anything this morning
[1:56:42] we are here to worship god
[1:56:46] not the devil
[1:56:48] so we are thankful to god
[1:56:51] that he is with us here as we open the
[1:56:54] holy scriptures and he will lead us on
[1:56:57] in jesus christ's name we pray for the
[1:57:00] word we are about to partake of
[1:57:03] in jesus christ's name amen
[1:57:06] okay
[1:57:08] so we
[1:57:16] and
[1:57:18] i left
[1:57:19] you with
[1:57:20] a part of the scripture here last night
[1:57:24] last night
[1:57:28] i must
[1:57:29] bring this
[1:57:31] first to you
[1:57:34] that is age twenty
[1:57:48] trying to
[1:57:50] comply
[1:57:54] i think
[1:57:57] you'll
[1:57:58] put on a paper something that will guide
[1:58:01] me
[1:58:10] so if
[1:58:11] it is on paper that
[1:58:14] at least
[1:58:15] we will wind up at
[1:58:18] this this time then it puts me in a
[1:58:21] better position
[1:58:30] i was supposed to read to you
[1:58:40] now we find
[1:58:42] that
[1:58:43] we find here that enoch was the seventh
[1:58:46] from
[1:59:01] before him died
[1:59:07] which
[1:59:08] was trans enoch was translated
[1:59:14] into
[1:59:19] showing that it is the seventh church
[1:59:22] age that takes the rapture
[1:59:43] it's the seventh church age that takes
[1:59:47] the rapture
[1:59:53] oh the rapture meaning
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:22] but we are leaving emperor
[2:00:52] to our side because it doesn't show the
[2:00:55] things that are happening
[2:00:59] it shows the things
[2:01:03] puts it as what it was
[2:01:09] [Music]
[2:01:21] talked about yesterday
[2:01:24] which one is that
[2:01:26] you
[2:01:27] we are ready to read it
[2:01:30] and the first epistle of john chapter 1
[2:01:35] which was from the beginning
[2:01:37] which we have had
[2:01:39] which we have seen with organs
[2:01:42] that which was
[2:01:43] from
[2:01:46] which we have had
[2:02:13] because
[2:02:14] the prophet says yoga
[2:02:28] that which was from the beginning
[2:02:44] at the
[2:02:54] we don't need to go to a bible school or
[2:02:57] what because the community is already
[2:03:30] which we have looked upon and our hands
[2:03:33] have handled of the way of life
[2:03:42] for the life was manifested and we have
[2:03:45] seen it and bear witness and show unto
[2:03:48] you that eternal life which was with the
[2:03:51] father and was manifested unto us amen
[2:04:27] a critic saying to me that
[2:04:30] you
[2:04:31] message believers
[2:04:33] believers you are also divided
[2:04:48] how can god be divided
[2:04:54] you heard me saying at the wedding
[2:05:04] can
[2:05:29] so now if we are one with god
[2:05:45] churches are divided
[2:06:09] [Music]
[2:07:10] and he was not
[2:07:13] amen
[2:07:14] because he
[2:07:16] a walk with god
[2:07:20] it pleased god
[2:07:23] until he was not
[2:07:38] of
[2:07:39] all the
[2:07:40] rest
[2:07:42] of them
[2:07:48] he was not found god took him
[2:08:20] without death
[2:08:25] what does that mean
[2:08:31] when enoch walked with god
[2:08:49] the rapture is in you
[2:08:54] already
[2:08:57] working with god in his word
[2:09:02] divided
[2:09:17] i take a turn to have a fellowship with
[2:09:20] somebody
[2:09:23] we had that fellowship before the
[2:09:25] foundation of the world
[2:09:29] we don't need a meeting in order to try
[2:09:32] to
[2:09:33] fellowship together
[2:09:37] we came fellowshipping together
[2:09:41] we are fellowshipping together
[2:10:11] we don't need a meeting for differences
[2:10:16] how can we differ
[2:10:18] we are the children of god
[2:10:21] there's no way because
[2:10:23] we are part of him
[2:10:25] and christ is different
[2:10:49] you know there is a book here i don't
[2:10:51] know if it is here with me
[2:11:18] this is the revelation of jesus
[2:11:23] is christ for a certain class of people
[2:11:29] i mean
[2:11:30] it's not for everybody i see among the
[2:11:32] man
[2:11:34] and at this seventh seal
[2:12:17] is
[2:12:59] uh
[2:13:00] he says the only way
[2:13:06] the only way you will know him
[2:13:10] because
[2:13:11] we the bride knows him
[2:13:42] [Music]
[2:14:08] will be called out of the seventh church
[2:14:11] age
[2:14:15] record of that age
[2:14:24] the
[2:14:28] right now
[2:14:30] let's look this is the seventh
[2:14:33] h
[2:14:36] and uh
[2:14:37] and
[2:14:38] in this seventh
[2:14:48] he says the seals in their opening
[2:14:52] makuto
[2:15:10] because church ages speaks of time
[2:15:15] time frame
[2:15:17] if you go back there how are you going
[2:15:19] around the people fighting
[2:15:22] about that
[2:15:23] fighting
[2:15:25] pastors
[2:15:32] the bride is in christ
[2:15:37] [Music]
[2:15:52] and so that's why i'm reading here now
[2:15:57] we are now
[2:16:00] in the rapture that we have the rapture
[2:16:03] in faith
[2:16:12] [Applause]
[2:16:14] you know how
[2:16:17] the bible says
[2:16:19] enoch
[2:16:21] walked with god for how long
[2:16:25] 300 years ago
[2:16:30] all these 300 years
[2:16:38] and who is the other one
[2:16:45] elijah earlier the bible says
[2:16:49] he was with elijah elisha
[2:16:52] elisha then he called elisha richard
[2:16:55] elisha actually to beat him
[2:16:58] goodbye
[2:17:11] [Music]
[2:17:12] elijah
[2:17:27] for them to receive the mental which was
[2:17:30] called the holy ghost
[2:17:35] you will always leave a witness behind
[2:17:37] it
[2:18:08] i will give it to you
[2:18:11] you know
[2:18:12] on the other side of jordan
[2:18:15] elijah doesn't say god will give it to
[2:18:17] you
[2:18:20] but jesus
[2:18:22] will give
[2:18:48] god
[2:19:01] uh
[2:19:19] because god is descended
[2:19:23] and then he was in him
[2:19:26] all right
[2:19:27] so now that's why he said to elijah
[2:19:30] yeah
[2:19:32] alicia
[2:19:46] i
[2:20:08] because you know what what is it
[2:20:11] i can read you something quickly
[2:20:24] you know
[2:20:25] the lord says
[2:20:26] the prophet says
[2:20:28] after
[2:20:53] they came forth upon the earth at
[2:20:55] perfection words
[2:21:23] a
[2:22:06] so now
[2:22:07] when he looked upon him
[2:22:09] he was a reflection
[2:22:12] of what his creator was yes
[2:22:18] amen when god looked at the man
[2:22:32] of everything that he is
[2:23:14] you know you should know god
[2:23:30] okay
[2:23:37] [Music]
[2:23:44] [Applause]
[2:23:53] [Music]
[2:23:57] i'll tell you
[2:23:58] something
[2:24:00] right now

[2:24:10] come call me come on
[2:24:23] and he was talking about who's that
[2:24:26] today demand
[2:24:55] because as i told you yesterday
[2:25:04] so now
[2:25:06] then it was pointed to them
[2:25:25] i was busy looking we were busy looking

[2:27:10] i want to worship in a church of this
[2:27:12] nature
[2:27:28] that is
[2:27:40] [Music]

[2:28:02] he
[2:28:03] finally he has won he
[2:28:06] he has
[2:28:08] let me read it
[2:28:12] was a reflection of what his creator was
[2:28:20] brother
[2:28:21] he
[2:28:25] a is of what she wanted you to be uh
[2:28:35] somebody doubt says i can't be that

[2:29:10] all right
[2:29:11] okay here now usually
[2:29:14] before we skip on
[2:29:18] we are talking about the rapture in
[2:29:20] faith
[2:29:34] our
[2:29:49] that's why you'll never see us involved
[2:29:51] in some meetings in trying to solve some
[2:29:54] quarrels and so forth
[2:30:01] will be called out of the 7th church
[2:30:14] shall never touch us
[2:30:31] we will be called out of the seven
[2:30:33] churches
[2:30:39] of that age
[2:30:44] now
[2:30:44] finally i'm going to read something here
[2:30:48] look it's about the system
[2:30:50] you know you you must say first to get
[2:30:52] to the nature of things
[2:30:57] we preach as preachers
[2:31:12] i'm going to read this part here
[2:31:16] yeah this is dealing with the gentiles
[2:31:20] i was looking for something but
[2:31:23] let's go to this
[2:31:25] uh
[2:31:30] [Music]
[2:31:41] and
[2:31:45] it shows a bunch
[2:31:48] all right let me take it from here
[2:31:52] uh
[2:31:53] you notice one more notice now no more
[2:31:57] for the end-of-time
[2:32:00] message
[2:32:08] you notice for the end of time message
[2:32:14] this
[2:32:14] seal
[2:32:17] amen
[2:32:18] which seal is this liquid
[2:32:21] yes
[2:32:22] after
[2:32:26] [Music]
[2:32:50] now even if you were trying to get to
[2:32:53] those things
[2:33:01] all
[2:33:02] things
[2:33:19] he has spoken about something there
[2:33:23] and
[2:33:24] it's so it is so difficult for the world
[2:33:27] to believe that we imagine
[2:33:31] i don't know if i've got the book i'll
[2:33:33] find it
[2:33:36] talking about the hour that we are
[2:33:39] living we are not even living in a
[2:33:42] certain hour
[2:33:49] uh
[2:33:50] when it starts will be absolutely a
[2:33:53] total secret
[2:34:00] before that remember
[2:34:08] at the end
[2:34:10] of the seventh angel's message
[2:35:10] it is this now the seventh season
[2:35:16] amen
[2:35:18] the end of the world now the first the
[2:35:20] owner of the seals
[2:35:35] it doesn't
[2:35:36] speak of the annihilation
[2:36:06] is actually the seals i would say is the
[2:36:11] message
[2:36:12] of the true fairness
[2:36:17] it doesn't go with the church ages times
[2:36:34] amen
[2:36:40] but he continues to say them seven
[2:36:42] thunders are turning themselves right
[2:36:45] close together
[2:37:27] you know the angels that came
[2:37:29] manila they were the interpretation
[2:37:56] it is
[2:38:24] we said last time revolutionary way you
[2:38:40] of the angels
[2:38:43] everything has changed
[2:38:46] his gospel has changed
[2:38:49] now in the constellation
[2:38:53] says
[2:39:48] 17
[2:40:02] the celestial buddhism
[2:40:11] [Music]
[2:40:18] how god can drive put something down
[2:40:22] into their hearts
[2:40:26] to put them first in orbit
[2:40:31] that's why even today
[2:40:34] nothing unless you are in the
[2:40:36] constellation
[2:40:40] amen there is it is not a church
[2:40:45] you know before the foundation
[2:40:57] and god decided to put us into a body
[2:41:13] this one will not hear this message
[2:41:29] that the lord has revealed to us
[2:41:31] hallelujah
[2:41:34] let's look at it
[2:41:37] all right
[2:41:39] it says here
[2:41:42] when he was looking for an
[2:41:45] an interpretation
[2:41:49] but i have this book here
[2:41:52] hey this is wonderful books man
[2:41:56] do you read the message
[2:41:58] god bless you for doing that
[2:42:02] some people don't even bother to
[2:42:04] read the message they are busy with
[2:42:06] their cell phones
[2:42:09] s
[2:42:19] you know
[2:42:21] did you know that a vote saver
