[1:17:46] to see the the
[1:17:48] SLE and behold there was a great
[1:17:50] earthquake for the angel of the Lord
[1:17:52] descended from heaven and came and
[1:17:55] rolled back the Stone from the door and
[1:17:58] set upon it verse
[1:18:01] 7 and go quickly and tell his disciples

[1:18:31] 11 disciples went away into Galilee into
[1:18:34] a mountain where Jesus had appointed
[1:18:36] them and when they saw him they
[1:18:39] worshiped him but some doubted and Jesus
[1:18:42] came and spake unto them saying all
[1:18:45] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[1:18:48] Earth go ye therefore and teach All
[1:18:51] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[1:18:54] the father
[1:18:55] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:57] teaching them to observe all things
[1:18:59] whatsoever I have commanded you and Lord
[1:19:03] I Am With You Always even until the end
[1:19:06] of the world amen amen you may be seated

[1:19:32] me
[1:19:37] and
[1:19:40] and may the Lord bless
[1:19:44] you okay mine I've got only 30 minutes
[1:19:48] here
[1:19:50] I I won't be long
[1:19:55] yes
[1:19:56] we know the
[1:20:01] family they are very notorious coming to
[1:20:05] the word of
[1:20:10] God they serve the Lord
[1:20:18] wholeheartedly yeah they serve the Lord
[1:20:27] we uh know them in all the
[1:20:33] outreaches and the brothers are always
[1:20:37] assisting in the
[1:20:42] technical they are a blessing to to the
[1:20:47] church and and Mama also was very
[1:20:50] supportive to the church
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:56] and her daughter too and the the
[1:21:02] grandchildren so it's just a family
[1:21:05] that really love the
[1:21:10] Lord so now now that we are gathered
[1:21:14] here ours is just to go to the word of
[1:21:20] God as usual
[1:21:25] I was just thinking
[1:21:29] today uh
[1:21:32] that it's quite a number of people that
[1:21:34] have dived this
[1:21:40] year that that is a
[1:21:44] sign now if you read my subject will be
[1:21:48] on verse
[1:21:49] 28 onse
[1:21:54] [Music]
[1:21:58] it says
[1:21:59] here teaching them to observe all things
[1:22:03] whatsoever I have commanded
[1:22:07] [Music]
[1:22:11] you and lo I Am With You
[1:22:16] Always even unto the end of the
[1:22:21] world so my title will be
[1:22:25] observe all
[1:22:32] [Music]
[1:22:34] things now I I went and
[1:22:39] check even if I I I I knew the way to
[1:22:46] observe but I just wanted to be
[1:22:51] sure it means uh to watch
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:22:57] carefully to observe means to watch
[1:23:03] carefully and it says especially with
[1:23:07] attention to
[1:23:14] details now that is why I'm saying if
[1:23:18] many people
[1:23:22] depart we we need to observe and go to
[1:23:25] the scriptures and
[1:23:31] check to see actually why is
[1:23:35] it yeah know we know that quite a number
[1:23:39] of people are
[1:23:43] going but there's a there's this year is
[1:23:46] quite a number of
[1:23:49] them I have the
[1:23:53] record and then I wrote them down all of
[1:23:57] them because I preached in their uh uh
[1:24:01] uh uh Memorial
[1:24:07] services so now our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:12] here the Bible says in in in in
[1:24:17] uh
[1:24:18] uh Matthew 28
[1:24:21] verse1 28 verse1 it says it was the end
[1:24:25] of
[1:24:28] Sabbath as it began to Dawn towards the
[1:24:30] first
[1:24:33] day of the
[1:24:35] week Mary
[1:24:38] Magdalene and the other
[1:24:41] Mary to see
[1:24:45] the and there and behold there was a
[1:24:49] great earthquake
[1:24:55] now usually if there's an
[1:24:59] earthquake everybody will feel
[1:25:04] it remember when our
[1:25:08] Lord was giving out the
[1:25:13] ghost the Bible
[1:25:16] says there was something that
[1:25:21] happened the moon itself
[1:25:25] there was
[1:25:28] Blackness there was
[1:25:31] thundering the veil of the
[1:25:35] temple you know about
[1:25:38] that but now people could not
[1:25:43] observe it was something it started with
[1:25:46] the
[1:25:49] soldiers they will just say yeah surely
[1:25:53] this was the Son of
[1:25:57] God and then it ended up
[1:26:02] there now going to Matthew
[1:26:07] 28:6
[1:26:10] 28:6 after the
[1:26:15] resurrection or before the
[1:26:18] resurrection he said to
[1:26:22] them uh we will meet meet at
[1:26:28] Galilee and
[1:26:30] then but they never observed
[1:26:34] that not even a single one of them went
[1:26:38] to
[1:26:41] galile and and what is happening
[1:26:45] now there are
[1:26:49] scriptures that speaks about the end
[1:26:51] time
[1:26:55] of which very few observe
[1:27:02] [Applause]
[1:27:03] that and and when he was
[1:27:08] departing remember in verse 17 it
[1:27:13] says they ended up
[1:27:17] meeting in
[1:27:19] Galilee in the
[1:27:22] mountain right on top of the
[1:27:25] mountain where everybody can see
[1:27:31] him that he has
[1:27:34] resurrected now verse 17
[1:27:37] says and when they saw
[1:27:41] him they worshiped
[1:27:44] him
[1:27:46] but some
[1:27:50] doubted his own disciples
[1:27:54] that at with
[1:27:56] him slept with
[1:28:00] him but they doubted
[1:28:03] him you are standing right in front
[1:28:08] of same
[1:28:11] image but they
[1:28:14] doubted some worshiped
[1:28:16] him some
[1:28:19] doubt right amen that is why now
[1:28:25] I I would speak about observing all
[1:28:31] things people were seeing him right on
[1:28:34] top of the
[1:28:38] mountain in verse 18 it says and Jesus
[1:28:42] came and spake unto
[1:28:46] them saying all power is given unto me
[1:28:55] in
[1:28:57] heaven and in
[1:28:59] Earth but people still doubt that
[1:29:05] power L he says all power is given unto
[1:29:12] me in heaven and all
[1:29:16] Earth but
[1:29:18] still there are those that want to
[1:29:21] challenge you
[1:29:25] am right
[1:29:27] amen that is why he
[1:29:29] said in verse
[1:29:32] 20 he taught
[1:29:35] them to observe
[1:29:40] all said they must observe all
[1:29:44] things when he taught his
[1:29:47] disciples he was teaching
[1:29:50] us because those
[1:29:52] disciples and end up being
[1:29:56] Apostles we are
[1:29:58] reading the
[1:30:01] teachings of the
[1:30:04] Apostles right amen so he went on and
[1:30:10] say I am with
[1:30:13] you
[1:30:15] all people still
[1:30:20] doubt look what he
[1:30:22] said I am with
[1:30:26] you
[1:30:31] always right amen now if he says I'm
[1:30:34] with you all
[1:30:36] we there is no time or a minute or a
[1:30:40] second where is not with
[1:30:46] you so he's always with
[1:30:51] us amen
[1:30:54] there are
[1:30:56] signs that are relevant to the
[1:31:01] occasion remember we are
[1:31:07] mortal when we cross over to
[1:31:12] immortality there's something that will
[1:31:17] happen there's a sign that is going to
[1:31:21] happen when one cross over
[1:31:26] to to
[1:31:29] mortality remember that there's
[1:31:33] time there's
[1:31:37] immortality death is the end of
[1:31:42] time what people go what people call
[1:31:47] death is the end of
[1:31:51] time when you cross over
[1:31:54] over to
[1:31:57] immortality that is the end of
[1:32:02] time right amen we are getting now into
[1:32:07] another
[1:32:10] dimension we have been Ash
[1:32:13] now into
[1:32:18] eternity are we
[1:32:21] together that is why a wellknown
[1:32:24] scripture in the book of Thessalonians
[1:32:27] first
[1:32:29] thians you don't have to read it I'll
[1:32:31] quot
[1:32:33] it he says but I will not have you to be
[1:32:40] ignorant concerning them which are
[1:32:45] asleep that you sorrow
[1:32:48] not even as others which have no hope
[1:32:55] you have to
[1:32:56] know that one is crossing
[1:32:59] over to
[1:33:03] immortality are we
[1:33:06] together so that is why
[1:33:09] now we should be very very very
[1:33:15] observant of the signs that indicate to
[1:33:21] us the details of promises
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:27] mind you we
[1:33:30] said to
[1:33:33] observe is to watch
[1:33:39] carefully especially with
[1:33:45] attention to
[1:33:49] details now there are details of
[1:33:52] promises
[1:33:58] in Genesis
[1:34:00] 15 the Lord spoke to
[1:34:04] Abraham and said your
[1:34:07] seat will be in
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:13] bondage but I will come and take them
[1:34:20] out Abraham Abraham
[1:34:23] was observant of
[1:34:26] that his son
[1:34:30] Isaac was observant
[1:34:34] of because
[1:34:36] Abraham observ the angel of the
[1:34:41] Lord there are
[1:34:43] people that are not
[1:34:47] observant of the
[1:34:49] presence of the Angel of the
[1:34:52] Lord Abraham
[1:34:54] was very
[1:34:58] observant and even taught
[1:35:02] Isaac Isaac was very
[1:35:06] observant he even
[1:35:10] taugh
[1:35:12] Jacob Jacob knew that this is the Angel
[1:35:15] of
[1:35:16] the struggled with it and said bless
[1:35:21] me he knew that was an angel
[1:35:27] and all
[1:35:29] Israel was observant of
[1:35:34] the Joseph was very
[1:35:38] observant but come to the
[1:35:41] Gentiles they are not
[1:35:46] observing right
[1:35:48] amen so it's it's a promise
[1:35:54] of the Divine
[1:35:59] visitation let's take the birth of our
[1:36:02] Lord Jesus
[1:36:05] Christ everything was displayed on the
[1:36:11] sky there was
[1:36:13] an a
[1:36:16] star there Angels going up and
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:21] down otherwise if they didn't see
[1:36:25] that wouldn't be knowing about
[1:36:29] that because it is written in the
[1:36:32] Bible it was
[1:36:36] displayed
[1:36:38] look when
[1:36:41] Mary
[1:36:43] met
[1:36:47] Gabriel the Bible
[1:36:49] says Gabriel said
[1:36:54] you will conceive in your
[1:36:58] womb and bear a
[1:37:02] child that was the word that comes from
[1:37:10] eternity God gave those
[1:37:14] words to
[1:37:17] Gabriel Gabriel was not carrying them on
[1:37:19] his hands like
[1:37:24] they were in the heart in the soul
[1:37:29] of and when he gave those words to
[1:37:35] Mary he spoke
[1:37:37] them it was from his
[1:37:42] heart his
[1:37:44] soul and then it went to the soul not to
[1:37:47] the
[1:37:53] the word of
[1:37:54] God is the soul of
[1:37:57] God and if the word of God is the soul
[1:38:00] of
[1:38:01] God when God sent his
[1:38:05] Angel he gave his soul to the
[1:38:12] angel and when the angel comes with that
[1:38:16] weight that we will land on the soul of
[1:38:20] the individual
[1:38:24] then you will believe
[1:38:27] it and when you believe it then it will
[1:38:32] create the
[1:38:37] purpose that is why now when one
[1:38:42] depart he goes back where he come
[1:38:49] from because the body we buried
[1:38:54] but the soul we cannot
[1:38:58] bury the soul come from
[1:39:02] God and it will go back to
[1:39:06] God so when you
[1:39:10] depart you go
[1:39:12] back to where you come
[1:39:14] from if you are not
[1:39:19] predestinated of course you you you you
[1:39:23] cannot go to uh the sixth
[1:39:31] Dimension so now
[1:39:33] God that is why his word comes from his
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:40] heart that's why he's got he's got a
[1:39:46] bride the
[1:39:48] bride is the heart and is the soul of
[1:39:51] God
[1:39:56] now that soul of
[1:39:59] God it's observant of his
[1:40:05] father because the
[1:40:07] bride
[1:40:09] is very very
[1:40:12] observant because it's the
[1:40:15] promise of
[1:40:17] God and is aware of the
[1:40:21] power and the life of the
[1:40:26] we see amen there's a we there's a life
[1:40:31] of
[1:40:33] the there's a word there's a revealed
[1:40:37] word and when the word is
[1:40:41] revealed it has
[1:40:46] power that is why now when the word is
[1:40:50] revealed
[1:40:53] it raises the
[1:40:56] standard and also the
[1:40:59] knowledge and also the
[1:41:03] understanding when the word is
[1:41:06] revealed the knowledge the standard of
[1:41:10] the the spiritual
[1:41:13] knowledge it's
[1:41:16] risen right
[1:41:19] amen now if the standard is is risen
[1:41:25] then you are know you will know that you
[1:41:26] are a stranger in this
[1:41:31] world you are an ambassador in this
[1:41:36] world there are
[1:41:39] signs that will make you to
[1:41:43] observe that you are an
[1:41:48] ambassador that is why there will be a
[1:41:50] time when you go
[1:41:57] actually the the
[1:42:00] memorial memorial it's not the memorial
[1:42:04] of the departure of
[1:42:08] [Music]
[1:42:10] sister
[1:42:12] no is the
[1:42:15] memorial of the
[1:42:18] resurrection of Our Lord
[1:42:23] when somebody
[1:42:25] depart we have a
[1:42:27] memorial the memorial has got nothing to
[1:42:30] do with his
[1:42:33] departure or
[1:42:35] departure our
[1:42:38] memory we see our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:46] resurrecting so our message has to do
[1:42:50] with Resurrection
[1:42:55] because we know that we are strangers
[1:42:58] here we
[1:43:01] observe that we are about to
[1:43:06] go the Bible says after he
[1:43:11] resurrected he went up the
[1:43:14] mountain he spoke to
[1:43:17] them then uh after speaking to them
[1:43:24] there was a
[1:43:25] sign a cloud came and received
[1:43:29] [Music]
[1:43:31] him that was a
[1:43:34] display for
[1:43:36] everybody a cloud look he was on top of
[1:43:40] the
[1:43:41] mountain everybody could see that he's
[1:43:43] on top of the
[1:43:45] mountain and the cloud is seen right
[1:43:50] there it came
[1:43:56] then the
[1:43:59] Angels Came also and
[1:44:03] said that same
[1:44:05] Jesus which is taken up from
[1:44:09] you into
[1:44:11] heaven shall so come in like he will
[1:44:15] come in that
[1:44:18] f as you have seen him go to
[1:44:21] heaven you will see
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:25] him now the
[1:44:28] cloud is
[1:44:30] displayed in each and
[1:44:33] every houses of the children of God most
[1:44:37] of you have got
[1:44:38] a it was displayed right on the
[1:44:46] sky most all and actually
[1:44:50] all the churches
[1:44:53] in the message they have
[1:44:56] the it's it's a
[1:45:00] display
[1:45:03] right but now when you have that
[1:45:08] display it should not just be
[1:45:12] displayed without
[1:45:17] observing there should be
[1:45:21] always should always
[1:45:24] observe everything that is
[1:45:27] happening that has to
[1:45:30] do with your going
[1:45:35] away your life has is just a temporary
[1:45:39] life here on
[1:45:40] [Music]
[1:45:43] Earth but the reality is that you are
[1:45:51] going in the book of Acts chapter
[1:45:56] 1 no no no in Matthew
[1:45:59] 27 verse 50 it says
[1:46:03] ver
[1:46:06] Jesus when he had cried
[1:46:10] again with a loud
[1:46:13] voice yielded up the
[1:46:17] G then
[1:46:20] 51 says and behold
[1:46:24] the veil of the temple was rent in
[1:46:32] twine you know that
[1:46:36] Jerusalem the temple in
[1:46:40] Jerusalem there's nothing that will
[1:46:42] happen to that
[1:46:44] Temple without all Jews knowing about
[1:46:48] [Music]
[1:46:51] it when that
[1:46:54] was H rent into
[1:47:00] two they should have
[1:47:05] observed because they said crucify
[1:47:08] him crucify him and when that V was
[1:47:14] rent to
[1:47:16] them I don't know whether they thought
[1:47:18] it was a magic or
[1:47:21] what that was a
[1:47:24] sign they should observe that this is
[1:47:27] not just an
[1:47:32] ordinary you know
[1:47:35] Mary was always
[1:47:42] observant Jesus when he was still a
[1:47:44] young
[1:47:45] man at times will get
[1:47:50] lost they will seek and find him
[1:47:54] and then they will try to repr remind
[1:47:57] him then he would say you are not my my
[1:48:01] my my my
[1:48:03] parents immediately they will they will
[1:48:07] remember because they
[1:48:10] had a Heavenly
[1:48:14] visitation knew that angel spoke
[1:48:19] to he was very observant
[1:48:23] Joseph knew that that was not his
[1:48:27] son he was very
[1:48:31] observant about John he was watching
[1:48:37] him very
[1:48:39] observant when John left the family and
[1:48:44] went into the
[1:48:45] Wilderness his father was not
[1:48:48] dismayed and an angel spoke to him
[1:48:53] he was very
[1:48:55] observant now the Bible says let us not
[1:48:59] be
[1:49:02] ignorant about the ones that are
[1:49:07] asleep we should be observant of that
[1:49:12] scripture that we should
[1:49:17] go are we
[1:49:21] together there was a
[1:49:25] day we've read
[1:49:27] it
[1:49:29] that the two
[1:49:33] Marys went to the
[1:49:36] tomb the Bible
[1:49:39] says an
[1:49:41] angel
[1:49:43] came and when that angel
[1:49:46] came there was
[1:49:49] thundering throughout
[1:49:53] everybody had there was there was
[1:49:56] earthquake everybody could
[1:49:59] hear there's quite a lot of
[1:50:02] [Music]
[1:50:04] earthquakes there is quite a
[1:50:09] number of
[1:50:13] angels investigating judgment
[1:50:19] Angels coming on this planet
[1:50:25] investigate but people are not
[1:50:29] observing
[1:50:32] no right
[1:50:34] amen so the two ladies
[1:50:38] came when an
[1:50:41] angel left
[1:50:44] [Music]
[1:50:47] eternity crossing over to this
[1:50:50] earth there was thundering
[1:50:54] I always together there was
[1:50:57] earthquake it remove the
[1:51:02] stone and put it and even sit upon it
[1:51:06] the sit upon
[1:51:10] it there were
[1:51:12] soldiers who were
[1:51:16] guarding they
[1:51:18] vanished they fainted but never repented
[1:51:27] they will just say that that guy is very
[1:51:30] terrible and continue with their
[1:51:33] Liv there are
[1:51:35] signs that are happening in front of our
[1:51:40] eyes in this
[1:51:42] world in this
[1:51:47] earth the Bible speaks about wars and
[1:51:50] rumors of wars
[1:51:54] we see them in
[1:51:57] everything but we don't do
[1:52:00] anything we see
[1:52:02] everything coming to his
[1:52:06] completion are we
[1:52:09] together now I said I'm not going to
[1:52:12] belong but the Bible
[1:52:14] says Graves were open there was
[1:52:20] earthquake after the earthquake
[1:52:23] remember the
[1:52:25] earthquake was that the Lord should make
[1:52:29] them
[1:52:33] aware when the angel
[1:52:36] comes that there's an
[1:52:39] earthquake now there are people that
[1:52:42] will read the
[1:52:44] signs and when they interpret what they
[1:52:47] have
[1:52:49] read people will think that they are mad
[1:52:53] they will point a
[1:52:55] star that star differs
[1:52:59] from Star means the Messiah is
[1:53:04] born together and then when that is done
[1:53:08] they say no these guys are mad people
[1:53:11] can interpret
[1:53:14] that there are people that can stand
[1:53:17] behind the
[1:53:18] ppit and interpret the word as Jes
[1:53:23] people say they are
[1:53:25] M
[1:53:28] right Graves were
[1:53:30] open when he
[1:53:33] resurrected Graves were
[1:53:35] open and many bodies of the
[1:53:41] S they
[1:53:43] rised then they appeared they appeared
[1:53:47] to many they saw them they saw
[1:53:51] them but what have they
[1:53:53] done nothing it now even
