neither under the F was able to open the book neither to look there on Amen amen and I wept much because no man was found waiting to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me whip node Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven Souls thereof number six and I be held in law in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamp as it had been slain having seven hongs and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth

Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen amen having having having predestinated us and to the adoption of children we are more revereign [Music] foreign foreign if a young woman is married by a Christian Brothers [Music] she will be saying to the people I don't know how he happened to choose me now what more if if God has chosen you know [Applause] amen amen that's why there was one who looked around and he said all things who is responsible for that the Lord God made them Allah and every person who has defined a Divine Mindy will never fail to worship Him [Music] and there was a brother he used to have some spiritual problems sometimes he would call me we sit down then he will say Hey brother I'm trying to do this but this is this is um [Music] I

beyond that oh yeah because rub off the way that says we shall be young amen so he introduced and he was only 33.33 okay I mean he's a young man yeah of course no one wants to worship an old God our God in his human form he's Young amen amen foreign [Music] we walk like a young man we work like a young man last night I don't know we we were after the funeral and all that we went home to start again for a uh over time I enjoy the word of God better when it is a After Time I take sleep and put it aside oh I mean then I continue the word of God I don't know maybe the brother will know we were getting to bed late yeah foreign there are things the people whether they are a message Believers or so forth but there's a standard set by God now this standard you understand that you say is from before the foundation [Music] been to Eternity because the Eternal being have got no beginning they are without beginnings yes that is facility [Music] amen all right now let us look I moved the brother here amen which one is this okay no problem now the book says the book was sealed with on the back side Ashley now what we were looking at what we were looking at last time even in Port Elizabeth that's why you see the Seed of Abraham amen is Ageless that's the Seed of Abraham that's why when Sarah was old and uh then God came you know she was old what about your face why because God acted on the back side 11. uh and the chapter 11 chapter 8 read let me hear but which one are you referring to Hebrews chapter 11 from verse 11 through faith also Sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age amen because she judged him faithful who have promised amen amen that even in my old age I can still have a baby [Music] is her faith was the faith of Abraham because it says yeah but referring to Abraham it says by faith now Sarah the wives it says through meaning through the faith [Music] as we are operating through the face of Abraham I mean okay amen no jolly it says yet inhale old the Bible doesn't hide that be really inhale all day if it says old age but yet Faith the faith in here was not only amen I mean it changed her into a young woman because he was coming through the predestination uh last night I was reading where brother problems [Music] talking about sister Hetty and uh he reached where the Bible says if you say you can say to that mountain move if it is by faith you can say that and he says when he needed a squirrel foreign now where there is no squares he believed in creation yeah somebody has said like the brother in Port Elizabeth and the brother was hit by a stroke when I was talking about sisters because I understand his mouth went skills but when he believed that well everything was true amen amen [Applause] it was not me it is [Applause] and I've seen many things happening with the people come out who have faith nothing Brothers although God said to the prophet make the people to believe [Music] not meaning to believe him as God but to believe he if he says by faith if you believe how would you man God has healed you [Applause] as you know I can't heal you I believe in a God who can heal you I will encourage you God who can heal you and if you believe healing I've seen many people I can refer to one in Swaziland because there were some witnesses I'm not talking about godima now what's wrong with you about the Lord Jesus Christ that's sister sister she had a problem with her legs then I took her hand and run it I think from there and they said how is it sister amen the brothers but I'm sure they were not clapping hands for me because I could don't do that nothing it's you who must believe because the Bible says all things are possible to them that believe you don't need you don't need water you need Jesus you know today hey look on Divine Healing is on sale [Music] you come what's up two women I was with babies [Music] they said they went to see a prophet he judged them what it is I don't know maybe but yes kosana can remember how much was it yes because they had paid deposits a paid that profit they are all called Prophets but only the Bible said yeah and this full prophets they perform miracles now we as Christians we don't wander at that they shall come and shall perform marriage and wonders now we know that's it okay amen let's do this now amen now why I read description we have a book here I'm going to refer to uh the very same things [Music] in just like as we were in um firstly it's not really a the word says the seventh seal which is Revelation chapter 8 verse 1. the people are struggling with that let's see and saying if a person says he can preach the seven seal he is a liar uh I believe that if a person believes the Seven Seals is something that should not be okay because that is the word of God but I told you one day we were looking for the kennel before a Brother's uh pickup brother from Swaziland now we arrive at the place then we arrived at that barriers what did he say no entry Beyond this point amen amen so we stopped said no end meaning you've been troubleshooting a young man [Music] he just went in straight through the gate yeah now there was a garden we ask you why we are forbidden he's the son of the owner of God will go through amen amen every song God knew this when he made himself a son amen amen and it says if you read perfect faith he died for you and me I will wonder if you can tell me that you don't believe him yeah I wonder if you want to be baptizing his name is because in the Bible said baptize them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy ghosts caught up with that and their disciples but the rest of the people amen amen they went ahead and say we baptize you in the name of the father now you ask what is that name if I say to you baptize this man of the father I'm referring to one day now I'm referring to his offices you go back you read Isaiah he's a father he came and was born like us he took a body of men then he said Son then he resurrected [Music] but fellow how many people one person and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ if you say father amen father is a title not a name [Music] try it one day sign your check and say father you want to check out all the bank they want what the name in the name of Jesus if you say to a demon I cast you in the name of father foreign [Music] [Music] uh she complained after foreign because the the Baptist today I I baptize you and uh three three times also three times I think the first time he is not wet enough according to the uh foreign [Music] said hey you left out the Sun he said in I baptize you in the name of the father and the holy ghosts foreign if you catch him into three pieces win but if he is one fella then you will see in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we have seen so many people back to their pastors and said ask your pastor to show you in the Bible where anybody was baptized and he said all things do all things receive the word of God I've finished with this the thing is the back side of the book as efficiency has predestinated us not in 1944 1944 but before the foundation of the world itself finish that's why God created the Earth because the Earth is the missile okay [Music] foreign [Music] because power he found them in some different systems even finally said to them I see no fault with this as for me posh I mean Orange listen now now the back side on the back side with Seven Seals and when he opened the seventh seal then it said early and the time is normal right now I read here now that's why the people do not understand things like the battle of armageddonough what it is what makes them not to understand even the seven seal itself people are still still crying out but you must say if somebody says this revealed is a lion is God's Prophet a lion we will read again that it is that's why you see people today resigning the Bible foretold that is the reason the reason I don't believe the message they don't even know what the word cult says a person who was not there cannot know their things that's why it says all the way who who this is Page 534. amen amen that's why you understand brother amen there are some sermons that a man will hear once yes and he will never again be interested in it it means he hasn't seen it ah no listen here the book was sealed one day back now you have the backside Mysteries all the way back from Genesis from there beginning in Genesis because in the beginning all right amen then another scripture here it says um about the seven meaning that for you to understand this or to hear this yourself God knows all things because he is the creator of all things foreign or else it will confuse you now the Lord Jesus came as the word that was manifested for this word to be made flesh she said I know that yeah this word eventually one day will be a speaking movement but for this word to speak it should be a man amen then he waited for the way when she approached the Lord Jesus Christ that's when the two texts came together [Music] okay I'll never quit this message [Applause] because I've seen it now John you don't come to to God by reading but you come by revelation [Applause] all right look the Lord Jesus comes he finds three men fishing a stranger to them as a h he said or follow me Peter John and James they just drop everything what has happened to them a fisherman fishing confusion yeah you mean I should leave my fishes what happened to them that's why worry he touched me oh he touched me and they say let let him touch you so he touched Peter Jones not with his fingers but from back there we fell out foreign Balaji till today they are with you [Applause] amen one seed he has predestinated when I remember what the Lord has done I will never go back anymore right when you remember the sin that was heard he's getting you closer to him when you remember what he has done when you are tested [Applause] I shall never go back you can always go back and say the reason foreign [Applause] that it is and the woman was the devil made had to think for yourself until she said okay okay okay [Applause] and you see it cost humankind diseases yes just because of that amen now that people want you not to believe but to think and Jesus never said Think Jesus [Applause] have faith in God amen lastly all the way [Music] from the very beginning I don't know if I can read another one right now this is what is happening here hmm that's why you know I was reading as I'm seeing the name Moses yeah and I was reading about

is it not happening nah idery so God is true he say it shall be like Sodom and Gomorrah yeah look the persecutions around the world against the Christians it is still coming I mean I mean but it is
