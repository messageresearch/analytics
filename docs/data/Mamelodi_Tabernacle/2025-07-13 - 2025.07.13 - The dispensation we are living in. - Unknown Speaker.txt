While you may take your seats while my brother is the scripture for the children. &gt;&gt; Where is the brother? Mark 10 from verse 13- 16. And they brought young children to him that he should touch them. And his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not. For of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein." And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. &gt;&gt; They brought their young children unto him so that he may touch them. They believed that if he can touch them, something will happen to their children. I believe also these ones They believe the same thing that they have brought their children to him because he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He only changed the mask, but he's the same Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is the name of this one? Malvin. All right, let's let's pray with Malvin. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, here is the child.

Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the name. [Music] Heavenly Father, this one is named happiness. Let the name characterize this child &gt;&gt; as I am handing him over &gt;&gt; into thy hand. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

[Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Um while standing on our feet, Let's open the book of Daniel chapter 9. Daniel chapter 9 verse 25- 27 verse 257. Daniel chapter 9 from verse 25- 27. Know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score and two weeks. The street shall be built again, and the wall even in trouble's time. And after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself. And the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. And the end thereof shall be with a flood. And unto the end of the war, desolation and deter and det are determined. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week. And in the midst of the week, he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease. And for the overspreading of abomination, he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate. Thank you my brother. Let me just uh read another one brother but now read Romans uh chapter uh 11. &gt;&gt; Romans 11. &gt;&gt; Let's read verse 20 uh 5- 26. &gt;&gt; 25- 26. For I would note, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentile become in. And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, there shall come out of Zion the deliverer, &gt;&gt; and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. &gt;&gt; You may take your seats. Let's close our eyes as we pray. Mighty heavenly father, scriptures are read. We are approaching thy holy presence. I'm here with my brother. We dedicate our voices unto thee &gt;&gt; so that you can use our voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; To deliver your message unto your children. &gt;&gt; We pray, Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; I greet you again in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Um I'm not so much all right but we are going to go on. I I I I I should not I should have not come here. &gt;&gt; But because my sister daunted me, I thought they time I don't want to break his heart. I want to break Satan's heart because he didn't want me to come. My voice was taken taken, &gt;&gt; but now he's back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, let's talk about the the dispensation we are living in now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just for a while. &gt;&gt; We're just going to talk. We have read the book of Daniel. &gt;&gt; It says Daniel prophesied about the whole dispensation. The whole Jewish dispensation. until the consummation and brother says if you want to know what day you are living in what what day what day let me put it like this if you want to know what Day of the month is it? You look at the calendar calendar. &gt;&gt; But he says if you want to know the day you are living in scripturally look at Israel. &gt;&gt; He says Israel is our calendar. Um Daniel said &gt;&gt; they were given seven treats were given to the to Daniel's people and his city. Daniel's people and Daniel's city they were given 7 weeks in other words until consummation. There is nothing after 70. that this consummation is finished with Daniel's people. &gt;&gt; Then he he he I he divided those weeks. He divided them into three periods. Three and a half Um the first period it was the period of the building of the temple. It was seven weeks and the second is 62 weeks. If you can add them, &gt;&gt; it is 69. &gt;&gt; 69 &gt;&gt; and 62 weeks. &gt;&gt; 62 weeks. &gt;&gt; It was from the completion of the temple until the Messiah. that is it will take 62 weeks and then one week it was given to Christ's ministry are you together I said it those seven weeks were divided into three periods The first one is 7 week period and the the second is 62 week period and the third one is one week period. Are you together now? And I said this one of seven week it was given to the building of the temple it will be built for seven weeks. And the second one when the temple is completed from there from the completion of the temple Until the Messiah arrive in Jerusalem, there &gt;&gt; it will be 62 weeks. Then when he has arrived, he will be given one week to minister. Are you together now? &gt;&gt; These are given to Daniel's people. These seven weeks, Daniel's people and his city, Daniel's people, they are Jews, &gt;&gt; not Gentiles, &gt;&gt; Jews. These are given only to the his city &gt;&gt; is Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Gentiles are not there. Then now this one week which is given to Christ ministry It was divided into two. &gt;&gt; One week is equals to seven years. [Applause] Are you listening? &gt;&gt; All right. If you are listening then I can go. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you take seven weeks and multiply them by seven because one week is seven years. When you multiply seven by seven, it will give you 49. Yes. In other words, they have taken 49 years building the temple. You multiply it by seven give you number of years. When we go to one week, we know that is seven years. Then when you divide seven by two, I don't have a pointer here. Can you give me a pointer &gt;&gt; to point there? &gt;&gt; If you don't have a point, doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Um, if you divide seven by two, &gt;&gt; it will give you three and a half. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus. prophesied &gt;&gt; three and a half years &gt;&gt; from 8030. He preached for three years. Then after 3 years he was cut off. He prophesied three and a half years. After three and a half years, he was cut off. When he was cut off, Gentiles &gt;&gt; came in there. I call it a gap &gt;&gt; between that the last three and a half years and &gt;&gt; the first three and a half years and years &gt;&gt; because this and that one seven years. Are you with me there? &gt;&gt; Then when he was cut off There were prophecies here because he prophesied about the destruction of the city, destruction of the temple. And then he prophesied about the the bad of the fig tree and other trees. talking about their restoration because he prophesied about them being scattered. But he prophesied about them coming back again when he was here. when he prophesied &gt;&gt; and as he has said the city was destroyed &gt;&gt; because he said it will be destroyed the temple was destroyed they were they were scattered to different nation And they when they were there, we read the the book of Romans. &gt;&gt; Can you read it again, my brother? Romans 11 from verse 25. For I would not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentile become in &gt;&gt; just there. &gt;&gt; This people of Israel, &gt;&gt; Daniel's people, &gt;&gt; they were blinded. So they rejected their messiah. That's why he was cut off because they were blinded. When they were blinded, the Bible says here they were blinded until the fullness of the Gentile. Hey, the Bible is telling us here when they were blinded, God will call the Gentiles for his name. When you call somebody for your name, you marry her. Amen. Because you give her your name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, in this gap, God will call his wife [Music] because he must have his wife with his name. They were called. They were called here the Gentiles. They were called &gt;&gt; here &gt;&gt; through seven messengers [Music] until to the seven church age. There are seven church ages somewhere here above &gt;&gt; because seven church ages church age &gt;&gt; is time &gt;&gt; then above here &gt;&gt; is above time. John says Revelation chapter 4, &gt;&gt; he said, "After this, &gt;&gt; I saw the door open, after this, after." Wow. Ah, no. After this, I saw the the door open in heaven. I heard the voice just like the first voice. I heard it now. I heard it now in heaven. After this, I can I can hear now from heaven. Another ministry now [Applause] [Music] is no more the ministry of seven church agents. [Applause] Is another ministry beyond beyond time. &gt;&gt; He was called to heaven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he is there, &gt;&gt; he could see things in heaven. [Music] After time, the seven angel messenger the seventh was called up here. He said, "I went to the west. &gt;&gt; I met seven angels in a form of a pyramid because the throne is seen from inside. You cannot see it from outside. That's why he was taken inside the pyramid &gt;&gt; because now he had another ministry. [Music] &gt;&gt; Then he brought this thing here, &gt;&gt; the capstone. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought it down. situation &gt;&gt; kept the church &gt;&gt; because the ministry after &gt;&gt; seven is the ministry of capstone ministry of cap is not the ministry of time the ministry of the capstone is is not the ministry of time &gt;&gt; is the mystery after time. Amen. And you cannot understand it &gt;&gt; because it's the ministry of the throne. You must get inside. You cannot understand it if you are not inside. All the outsiders They don't understand it. They cannot understand that capstone. They've written their love. If you look at the the pyramid there. Why? Why have they written love there? Because he's love is God. The capstone is God. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we are living here &gt;&gt; beyond time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, &gt;&gt; now we are invited &gt;&gt; to come &gt;&gt; and eat because God told the seven angel messenger. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I'm just giving you a tip &gt;&gt; said store the food. Why should he store the food? &gt;&gt; He was stoing it for me. [Music] &gt;&gt; So that I and me I must start by pastor first. We can go &gt;&gt; and pick those &gt;&gt; and present it unto you. Amen. If he didn't, &gt;&gt; what will you be eating at this point in time? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He studed them. He said don't worry I'm taking long time when I preach because I'm story [Applause] they are hidden manner [Music] hidden manner is not just taken by anybody because they are hidden. Now &gt;&gt; this dispensation &gt;&gt; is the dispens where you have to partake to partake from the hidden manner. You must eat &gt;&gt; of the body weight &gt;&gt; of the son of man. &gt;&gt; This is the dispensation of eagles. &gt;&gt; The proverb says &gt;&gt; for the eagle to fly high It must eat fresh food. The prophet knew that in this time where we are living now it will time for ichess. So that they must be prepared to fly. They must eat it fresh man. He said why the vulture cannot fly like an eagle. He said the answer is the food it is eating. Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. Amen. It cannot fly higher. The problem is the foot. That's why the prophet says it helps. You must know where you attend the church at &gt;&gt; and you must know who is fitting you. Because this is the time of the eagles must be fed by by the hidden manner so that they can fly. This is the time to fly [Applause] and you will fail if you don't identify where those foods are. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are That's why &gt;&gt; he says &gt;&gt; this is a mystery &gt;&gt; that Israel was blinded is the Bible says &gt;&gt; that is Paul. &gt;&gt; Yes. He will come like a thief. in the night. &gt;&gt; But he said not to you, [Music] &gt;&gt; but to those who are blind, those who are ling the food, he will come to them as a thief. But you know, They were blinded &gt;&gt; so that he can come &gt;&gt; call us &gt;&gt; in the gap. [Music] &gt;&gt; When we read through chapter 3, I believe it's verse 14. Verse 14, &gt;&gt; it's it talks about churches. He said the people there They are blind. &gt;&gt; Why now blind? &gt;&gt; Why now blind? &gt;&gt; They are the people. &gt;&gt; The last church age people there are blind. &gt;&gt; Then he said he is knocking at the door outside the age. The ages driving him out because they are blind. Why blind? &gt;&gt; So that he can go back to Israel to come to us. &gt;&gt; Israel was blinded. To go back to Israel, &gt;&gt; Gentiles must be blinded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Read Hosea. &gt;&gt; Read chapter 6. &gt;&gt; Hosea chapter 6. Hosea chapter 6. &gt;&gt; Hosea chapter 6. &gt;&gt; If you find it, &gt;&gt; read it. &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to2. &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to2. &gt;&gt; Chapter 6 verse 1-2. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 6 verse 1-2. Come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us. He hath smitten and he will bind us up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After two days will he revive us. In the third day he will rise us up and we shall live in his sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this this script here &gt;&gt; he was giving a prophecy &gt;&gt; of this time this time. &gt;&gt; Are you listening &gt;&gt; now? He was talking to Israel. &gt;&gt; Israel saying he has torn us apart. He has scattered us. &gt;&gt; Now he will sc will gather us again. &gt;&gt; Prophesied in those days. &gt;&gt; He say it was 780 BC &gt;&gt; when he prophesied. &gt;&gt; But that thing happened later after Jesus. [Music] when they were scattered. But now they've been brought back. He said, "Let's return to him because he's the one who taught us now he will heal us." Is that after two days? &gt;&gt; After 2,000 years, &gt;&gt; he will wake us. &gt;&gt; That is what he says. &gt;&gt; He will revive us. He said on the third day he will raise us up they will have a revival when they come together coming it was revival but on the third day he will raise them up. Where are we living now? &gt;&gt; On the third day we are above 2,000. &gt;&gt; We are on the third day. What what can happen for Israel to rise up? &gt;&gt; When they raise up is when they recognize him. Amen. That is the day &gt;&gt; we are living in now. &gt;&gt; He said in book the book of Romans he said when the time of the the fullness of the Gentiles has come then Israel will be saved again. That is what Paul is saying. That is what is saying. Amen. &gt;&gt; Talking about Israel, &gt;&gt; there are prophecies of it. &gt;&gt; Put my picture back there. Here they were scattered. &gt;&gt; Here they were gathered. &gt;&gt; Israel. Israel. &gt;&gt; In this gap here in this gap here. Israel was scattered. In this gap here, Israel were gathered. Now in this gap here, Israel is gathered. &gt;&gt; In this gap here, &gt;&gt; what are they waiting for? &gt;&gt; They're waiting for their Messiah. in this gap here. &gt;&gt; But the the pro the prophecy said &gt;&gt; they will receive the Messiah on the third day. And according to the Yes, we are living on the third day. And if they recognize their Messiah, They will recognize him when we are we are not here. &gt;&gt; They will recognize him. In other words, &gt;&gt; you are just standing on your toes. [Music] You are not standing on your now. you are staying the one you are [Applause] because your time is over. Amen. &gt;&gt; While we are looking at the Israel, &gt;&gt; when we are looking at them there is [Music] these two walls. Other one is this side of Millennium. Other one is that side of me. &gt;&gt; The other one is Ezekiel chapter 38 and 39. 38 says &gt;&gt; it will be fought when the bride is taken. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now what is happening in Israel? There are wars. &gt;&gt; When they talk about this G, &gt;&gt; Pia is mentioned there &gt;&gt; and Pia &gt;&gt; is Iran. &gt;&gt; And then Russia &gt;&gt; because Gawk is Russia. because Gog is the prince of Gog of Mog. &gt;&gt; Prophecies is Russia, &gt;&gt; but he said it will be with Persia and other countries fighting with Israel. &gt;&gt; But we know Russia and other country will be defeated by Israel. &gt;&gt; Now because there is a war if that war is leading to [Music] it means we are standing on our tombs. The prophecy must be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Russia must fight with Israel. &gt;&gt; Is the prophecies read Ezekiel chapter 44. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse one, two, three. &gt;&gt; Verse one. Ezekiel 44 verse 1 to3. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 44 1-3. Then he brought me back the way of the gates of the outward sanctuary, which lookth toward the east, and it was shut. Then said the Lord unto me, "This gate shall be shut. It shall not be opened, &gt;&gt; and no man shall enter in by it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, &gt;&gt; therefore it shall be shut. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is for let's just stop there. &gt;&gt; The secular says &gt;&gt; he led me through the gate. &gt;&gt; Then he said this gate &gt;&gt; must be shut. This eastern gate, &gt;&gt; the walls of Jerusalem has seven gates, &gt;&gt; but there is one which faces east which is called the eastern gate. Hallelujah. Ezekiel says, "This gate must be shut." &gt;&gt; He was prophesying that time &gt;&gt; about the gate. Amen. &gt;&gt; It must be shut because the king has entered in. When Jesus entered Jerusalem, &gt;&gt; he entered through this gate in Matthew chapter 21. &gt;&gt; When Jesus entered there, he entered through the eastern gate, Ezekiel said, "It must be shut because the enter There was a king &gt;&gt; after who closed that gate. &gt;&gt; Only that gate &gt;&gt; other other six they still they're still open even but that one it was closed it is even now closed. Because Ezekiel said &gt;&gt; it must be closed. &gt;&gt; You see the prophecy spoke &gt;&gt; then someone comes &gt;&gt; and fulfills that prophecy. That is the name of the man &gt;&gt; in 1541. &gt;&gt; 1541 &gt;&gt; close that gate. And he used big stones. Why? He said because they say the the juices, the Messiah is going to come through it. Now I must close it so that the Messiah must not come. I shall see where the Messiah will get through. Because this one I'm shutting it big stones. &gt;&gt; But prophesied. &gt;&gt; He had prophesied. &gt;&gt; I was with my pastor. That's why I had to read this thing. He told me at that gate now is about to be open. [Applause] When my pastor told me then I have to go and look. [Applause] I found that yes. They say there is things happen near that gate. sometimes they see dust coming out of that. There are some cracks in the gate there on those rocks where no one will open it. Even their messiah will learn to authenticate. &gt;&gt; But now some forces are opening it. Now &gt;&gt; Zechariah &gt;&gt; Zechariah &gt;&gt; verse 14. Chapter 14 I believe. &gt;&gt; Zechariah 14. I will want you to read verse four verse4. And his feet shall stand in the day upon the mount of olives, &gt;&gt; which is before Jerusalem on the east. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and the mount of olive shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. According to the Bible in Zagaria there, the Jews &gt;&gt; are waiting for Christ, &gt;&gt; the Messiah &gt;&gt; to come &gt;&gt; to this mountain. Amen. &gt;&gt; This mountain is just facing Jer gate. That's why they believed that he will come on that mountain to get through that gate because that mountain is all right. Let's read another scripture. Read my brother. Acts chapter one verse 12. Verse 12. My pastor told me the gate is shaking when after telling me I go and look. &gt;&gt; I see it. Oh, it's shaking. [Applause] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? &gt;&gt; The Messiah is coming. Chapter one. &gt;&gt; Chapter one &gt;&gt; verse. Because they say, &gt;&gt; "All right, read it." The Bible talk. &gt;&gt; Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called olive &gt;&gt; which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath day journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Let me just see. I want you to I said you must read chapter one. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um start from verse 11. Verse 11 &gt;&gt; through 12. &gt;&gt; Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? &gt;&gt; This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven &gt;&gt; shall so come in like manner as he have seen him go into heaven. 12 &gt;&gt; Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olive, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath day journey. &gt;&gt; When Jesus, according to the scripture, according to what they believe, they believe that Jesus will return again on this month only. The same place he ascended into heaven from. When he ascended to seven to heaven, he was on Mount Olive. The Bible says so. My brothers read it. You read, you must read your Bible. When he was ascending to heaven, he they were on Mount Olive. Mount Olive is just next to the eastern gate. After he has ascended up, they went through the gate back into the Jerusalem again. The Bible says so. Amen. They believe he will come back on that mountain where he ascended to he from. He will come back on that mountain. When he ascend the gentiles were not there. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he ascended to heaven gents were not there. He was with his 12 apostles. The Jews they waiting for him to come back there to the Jews. Not to you &gt;&gt; to us in a supernatural realm. &gt;&gt; He has resend. He has descended. &gt;&gt; We are waiting for the corporal. [Music] Is it he will appear again? to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In a glorified, &gt;&gt; we shall see him because we'll be like him. Three, amen. When he returns, he will be in a corporal body. Thessalonians chapter 1 first chapter 4. He say he will move from the seventh dimension and go to the sixth and pick the saints there who are in the theophony [Music] and come back with them. He will remain between heaven and earth. Those brothers and sisters who are in their theophanes, they will come to us so that we together with them can change our bodies. This is a vile body [Music] is a pest house. Amen. &gt;&gt; We will take this pest house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will come back with the theophony. &gt;&gt; He being in a glorified in the glorified. But the but brothers and sisters who have passed away they will come in theophanes when they come here on earth they will find us having the in us [Applause] theophony in us will be shivering wanted to get out the because he has brought them. [Music] &gt;&gt; Then this this this terrible body &gt;&gt; will vanish. We shall put on another body. &gt;&gt; When Elohim went to Abraham with two angels, he just took 16 elements on earth and build. He said, "You get into this one. This is your this one. Get into this one. This is what happening. He said now myself I get into this one. Now there are three men in inly bodies which are called glorified bodies because that in those bodies now we are can eat but you will never eat. You cannot eat in the manopan does not eat. Even Jesus himself when he get through the the wall there he was in the the when he get inside he to another booty a glorified one. Get come point here. You will see scares here man change in when he find Peter and what on the sea there fish in there. Another one fish was on the fire there. Give me that one. He eat because he was in a glorified body. After a while, he vanished with [Music] after Abraham after Elohim has visited Abraham after after he has eaten Abraham. Now I'm moving after said I will I will accompany you. All right, let's come back. When they went to a certain place, he vanished. Abraham said, "Wait, he went back into the next morning, Abraham went where he was with Elohim. He &gt;&gt; look at Sodom. at the same place where he was with where he was with Elohim, he could see so because he was standing at the right place. In order to see, you must come to the right place where the supernaturals are. You will not just see where we not just see at any place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is my sketch? Where we are &gt;&gt; this way. Where is my sketch here? Sketch this guy. &gt;&gt; He's gone. Has finished. He just changed back into your All right. What is this one? Oh, this one. We are at the end. &gt;&gt; When we are at the end, things are happening &gt;&gt; with us &gt;&gt; and with Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Gentiles &gt;&gt; are blinded. &gt;&gt; They are singing. &gt;&gt; They are singing. &gt;&gt; They're performing miracles. But they are blinded. &gt;&gt; You see and Moses, &gt;&gt; and Moses, &gt;&gt; they were performing miracles together. &gt;&gt; Bam was performing more miracles. Moses, when it comes to prophecy, when it comes to miracles, you cannot identify which one is which one. by their difference. &gt;&gt; It was their teaching. &gt;&gt; Our difference with this denomination is our teaching. They they will never reach where we are. Even if they can copy, these are hidden fruit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's close our eyes as we pray. [Applause] Mighty heavenly father, &gt;&gt; the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; you said no one knows &gt;&gt; when you will come, &gt;&gt; even the angels, only the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the time of fatherhood. &gt;&gt; That is the reason we know &gt;&gt; because the son doesn't know &gt;&gt; during the dispensation of the son of God. &gt;&gt; People wouldn't know when you would come. But because we are beyond &gt;&gt; the dispensation of the son of God, we are in the dispensation of the fatherhood. &gt;&gt; Now we know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know these things. &gt;&gt; Thank you, father. &gt;&gt; You said it doesn't take men to run. &gt;&gt; It takes you. to identify &gt;&gt; and choose. &gt;&gt; Thank you for this time we are living in. &gt;&gt; This time is the dispensation of the rapture. &gt;&gt; We hear the sound of the harvesting machine.

Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom he have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.

Uh just before we call the pastor to close in prayer, there's a testimony that I want to give. Uh if the pastor allows me my brother, can you just help to translate the testimony? I'm sure pastor Israel is rejoicing and dancing today. You know, few years ago, the pastor took myself and brother Morero to a hospital to see a young child. It was a very traumatizing situation. When we arrived at the hospital myself, I was shaking. I was very scared. That was the day we went to see Sister Perfect. Perfect. I think she was about two to three months. &gt;&gt; So they when we arrived at the hospital the mother was giving a testimony also &gt;&gt; that you know there's this machine that they connect to see if the child is still alive. I don't know what you call those machines. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they will connect those machines. &gt;&gt; It will show that the child is not alive. Then they will bring another machine and another machine and the child was connected to oxygen but it didn't show life. But when they disconnect the machine to tell the mother the bad news, then the child is active. See, so then the pastor was talking to the mother, encouraging the mother to say nothing is impossible with God and the pastor took the child in in in in his hand. It it was a very traumatizing situation &gt;&gt; because at that time myself and brother Morero we were saying hey this child will even pass away in the hands of the pastor. You know it was very scary but the pastor was so relaxed and took the child in in his arms and and the the mother was saying this child don't even sleep for the last few days. He has just been up [Music] you know and and the doctor was saying the child must sleep and the child was not sleeping. Then the pastor hold the child and started talking to the child. And Sister Perfect was looking at the pastor like this. And the pastor says, "When I leave the hospital, you're going to sleep. And the child was going like this." [Applause] And and we were very surprised. How is it possible that a child less than 3 months can understand what the pastor is saying because now the pastor was no longer talking to the mother but talking directly to the child you know and that time even the legs were they were joined at that time you know there was no sign that the child will ever walk even the doctors were saying This child will never walk. But the pastor talking to the child says you are going to walk you know and the child was just noting like this. And today she's baptized. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is wonderful. You know, it makes me rejoice in my heart and I'm sure the pastor is very happy to see sister Perfect being baptized. May the Lord richly bless you and may the Lord bless the family and our precious sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastor, over to you. [Applause] Let us pray. Oh dearly father, when you start to bring birth on the earth, you allow the water to be the first thing to come out. &gt;&gt; Then after water, it will be blood. Then after blood would be the child. Knowing that there will come time when people want to come to you because it will take birth for someone to come to you. Then when they come they must follow the process of a natural birth. &gt;&gt; They must pass through the water. Because it's the first thing in the natural birth. After death, it will be water. The word then the spirit. As we have done according to as you have said, we believe you will take over from here. We believe you are taking over. as you have taken over with a sister when he was at the hospital. &gt;&gt; Bless her and bless everybody who came out of this water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Just turn to your neighbor and say, "God bless you richly. Brother, can you come forth? My brother, your father used to bless us and dance. So, we want you just to bless us with a song. And after we call uh my friend here just to say amen. Then we'll hand over to the worship team. May the Lord richly bless you. Amen. Hallelujah. But after such a testimony, am I right here? Okay. After such a testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; Sing again. Sing [Music] so [Music] again. again.
