[31:55] &gt;&gt; The pastor normally says Those of the

[33:15] There was no way for us to appreciate
[33:16] the pastor.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; We met him in the convention.
[33:22] We met him in big uh services.
[33:27] In our heart it was something that he
[33:28] wanted to do but we were unable
[33:34] but God gave us an opportunity
[33:37] &gt;&gt; on his birthday.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; We came as the entire church from Cape

[39:37] to request our pastor here, pastor Miva,
[39:41] &gt;&gt; just to give
[39:43] wishes
[39:45] &gt;&gt; of birthday to our
[39:48] &gt;&gt; pastor
[39:50] &gt;&gt; to his daddy.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; So we'll hand over to you pastor.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So,
[40:04] &gt;&gt; amen.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; English is fine.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, they say I must speak English.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; I am greeting all of you in the name of
[40:14] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; We Let me just stand in front of the
[40:18] pastor.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Be here. Amen.
[40:24] Uh I really appreciate
[40:27] the invitation that the family extended
[40:30] to me and say uh your your father is
[40:34] celebrating.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Come and be part of the celebration.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; One thing that is difficult is that
[40:41] whenever the family invites me,
[40:44] &gt;&gt; it's difficult for me to say no.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; So I cancel everything.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; And make sure that I'm I'm here. Amen.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; The I don't know sometimes time doesn't
[40:57] do justice when you want to speak about
[41:00] the experiences that you one has had
[41:03] with the pastor
[41:04] &gt;&gt; and you look at the sacrifices that he
[41:07] has made for the ministry.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Uh you know there are times where I
[41:12] thought he he made many sacrifices for
[41:16] what was then called northern transval.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. But as you travel around the
[41:20] continent, you realize that you go to
[41:23] Malawi,
[41:24] &gt;&gt; they say Malawi, he was here. You go to
[41:27] Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe say he was here.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Then you go to Botswana, they say he was
[41:32] here.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Then you go to Zambia, they say he was
[41:35] here.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; You go to Switzerland, they say he was
[41:38] here. You go to Luchu, they say he was
[41:41] here. Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; You go to America, they say he was here.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[41:48] &gt;&gt; uh I think it's it speaks about the
[41:52] quality of a leader
[41:54] &gt;&gt; that he has been
[41:56] &gt;&gt; not just for the mood church.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Uh for personally for me I've learned a
[42:01] lot.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes you learn from home
[42:05] &gt;&gt; but you you become very appreciative
[42:08] when you travel
[42:09] &gt;&gt; and you compare yourself with other
[42:11] kids.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Then you realize that they don't know as
[42:14] much as you know. Then you realize that
[42:16] at home I was well raised.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Not only wellised but I was well taught.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; You know pastor has taught me how to
[42:25] approach
[42:26] &gt;&gt; the ministry.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; One thing that he told me that in
[42:29] ministry we don't speak about money.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; He often tells me says if you plant a
[42:35] seed orange
[42:36] &gt;&gt; and you water it
[42:38] &gt;&gt; it will bring
[42:40] its moment you start shouting and say
[42:42] where are my oranges? The problem is
[42:44] that the soil might be wrong or the seat
[42:46] might be wrong
[42:47] &gt;&gt; or there is no moist.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; So personally I I personally appreciate
[42:53] you as an elder and then I would not be
[42:56] where I am in terms of the ministry
[42:59] &gt;&gt; uh without your input. We spend many
[43:03] times in this room where you are giving
[43:05] advices and for that we appreciate you
[43:09] &gt;&gt; and I'm here on behalf of our church our
[43:13] family to say we we salute you. Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; You know, brother say in in taking sides
[43:19] with Jesus, he says, "Now, I think this
[43:22] church, if you mean when you build this
[43:24] church, make this like your headquarters
[43:28] &gt;&gt; and like brother Neville being here
[43:31] being like a senior elder among you and
[43:33] in this case, pastor being a senior
[43:36] elder
[43:37] &gt;&gt; and mommy being headquarters.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; We were born by Mommy Lot."
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even those that may reject it, but
[43:44] they were born by mommy.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; They would have never known what the
[43:48] message is like unless they were taught
[43:50] by the elder.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; So you say sometimes you you get a
[43:53] question that you can't discuss out with
[43:55] your church out there. Then bring it
[43:57] here to brother Nevin and you all
[44:00] discuss it together and you can come to
[44:02] any decision. I'll be coming pretty soon
[44:05] and we'll come together with it. Then he
[44:07] say get training in your own groups,
[44:10] other ministers, men that you see that
[44:12] has a calling in their life for the
[44:13] ministry. Train them young men. Bring
[44:16] them in here to the elder.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Uh you know the the problem today, we've
[44:22] got people that are ministering but we
[44:23] don't know who gave birth to them.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Even when they become
[44:28] &gt;&gt; they become we don't even know why to
[44:31] report.
[44:34] Even in the message we are beginning to
[44:35] have the little bushiris
[44:40] but here I'm I'm very proud
[44:43] &gt;&gt; to have come in contact with this elder.
[44:46] I'm very proud to have been ordained by
[44:48] him. He has dedicated our church.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; We have not dedicated our church but
[44:54] they build we build a new building and I
[44:57] was talking to the doctor say we we
[45:00] don't know who needs to do it. you sort
[45:02] out the pastor that he becomes healthy.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Because we want him to come and preach
[45:06] here.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; So we we we really salute you Muti and
[45:10] may God preserve you.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; You have taught us the seven seal
[45:16] of the revelation of the son of man. You
[45:19] have taught us about the third pool. You
[45:22] have taught us about God before he
[45:23] became God.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Deep subjects that that will
[45:29] never leave us. And it's part of your
[45:31] legacy. You made things more clearer.
[45:34] You know, brother says after I'm gone,
[45:36] there are men that will come and make
[45:38] things clearer.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; And the pastor's favorite quotation is
[45:41] in Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[45:43] where he said the whole thing
[45:45] &gt;&gt; is about men and God becoming one.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; And for that we have seen God in your
[45:51] flesh.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; We have seen him in your ministry.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; We have seen how you had such a a
[45:58] burden. Maybe I won't take much time.
[46:00] There was a time where the pastor wanted
[46:02] a certain old woman to be built a house
[46:06] &gt;&gt; and trustes were taking time and the
[46:09] pastor heard him. He says I will go
[46:11] there take my own money and build it
[46:14] to build it.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; So it tells you about somebody that has
[46:17] got a burden
[46:18] &gt;&gt; for the people. You know there are
[46:20] people that are just ministers and
[46:21] pastors but they don't have burden for
[46:23] the people.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; But this old man has got a burden.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. When things are not going right,
[46:28] he gets troubled. When people are not
[46:30] being taught correct, he's troubled.
[46:34] We just want a great privilege that I'm
[46:37] here.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; The devil fought us many times. He
[46:40] thought he will separate us, but we keep
[46:42] on coming back together.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; It's never easy to separate a father
[46:50] from a son.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you, pastor.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:59] No,
[47:00] thank you. Thank you for that. Then we
[47:02] move over to the next item which is
[47:05] special item by the Cape Town and
[47:07] Switzerland.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; That's what it says on the program.

[53:51] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[53:53] Christ.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Uh
[53:56] I don't know if I can take 2 hours of
[53:58] your time
[54:00] because
[54:02] I grew up not talking a lot but these
[54:04] days I don't know why when I talk I
[54:07] don't stop.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:09] So
[54:10] I thank you for the opportunity once
[54:13] more and uh pastor is our father mostly
[54:18] all of us here he married me as well is
[54:21] my wife when we still young
[54:24] so I've been with him for a long time
[54:28] but I didn't prepare anything I just
[54:31] want to brief you about something
[54:34] &gt;&gt; I just experience now I can say a lot
[54:38] But I'm just going to start by saying I
[54:41] was with the pastor there as the
[54:43] hospital. Just one thing that happened
[54:45] there. I'm going to introduce you to you
[54:48] my new name.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; When I was there,
[54:51] &gt;&gt; sister was coming from the world. He
[54:53] said, "Go and assist the papa is looking
[54:57] for prince. I don't know who's prince."
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Then when I get inside the where he was
[55:02] in the hospital, I was walking with the
[55:04] doctor and he said, "Yeah, this is
[55:06] Prince.
[55:09] He didn't know. I I never even told my
[55:11] wife. I came out of the word be Mr.
[55:14] Prince.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; So I I thank
[55:20] &gt;&gt; pastor for the new name you have given
[55:21] me. I adore it. Secondly,
[55:26] I was with a pastor in a lot somewhere
[55:28] and then we were talking and sitting
[55:30] down. He said, "Boo, I saw children of
[55:34] God rapturing
[55:37] Then I look at him.
[55:41] You were there.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; So those are the things that were in my
[55:50] heart
[55:51] &gt;&gt; like you are today. You know them.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; But he said to me, "But I'm worried I
[55:57] didn't see so and so.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; But I'm one of them."
[56:05] Mama gave me a name. He said, "Branel,
[56:08] today onwards, your brother growth."
[56:10] Because I quoted something about growth
[56:13] who was always next to brother Brenham
[56:14] say Papa God
[56:16] &gt;&gt; help the man of God.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; So I've got two names. You can choose
[56:19] the one.
[56:22] So those pastor the moment we spend
[56:26] together it lies. It is like my entire
[56:30] life. That's what happens. And from uh
[56:34] those that are here, those are not here,
[56:36] but wishing to have you to this day, we
[56:38] say happy birthday, pastor. May God
[56:41] preserve you many, many years to come
[56:44] because we still need your ministry.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you.

[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. And then we still need your
[1:07:25] guidance. You know there is wisdom
[1:07:27] behind a white hair.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; There is a lot of years that a white
[1:07:31] hair has gone that some of us hasn't
[1:07:33] gone.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; So that kind of a wisdom is something
[1:07:36] that's supposed to guide us, lead us. So
[1:07:39] that is why we need you just for
[1:07:40] leadership to guide us to show us the
[1:07:44] way because they you know they say the
[1:07:47] Bible says there's no new thing under
[1:07:48] the sun.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; So even though we might be living in a
[1:07:51] modern society where there is modern
[1:07:54] challenges modern events we can actually
[1:07:56] go back
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; whatever challenge you might be having
[1:07:59] we can actually go back and relate. So
[1:08:01] but if you can relate, you can come to
[1:08:03] the person and say pastor this is my
[1:08:04] situation and you can say maybe
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; some of us were not here 1970 but you
[1:08:11] can actually say 1970
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; such and such happened and this is how
[1:08:16] we went through it. You see because
[1:08:18] there is wisdom behind experience. So
[1:08:21] the experience that the pastor has is
[1:08:22] the kind of experience that we can never
[1:08:24] have
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; but we can always clean on it
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; you know come and get something from it
[1:08:32] so that we can move forward because
[1:08:34] behind him there is a lot of guidance
[1:08:36] and wisdom that the God has given him.
[1:08:40] You know, sometimes it's it's nice to be
[1:08:41] an old person,
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; but it's more nicer to be an old person
[1:08:44] in the Lord because when you are an old
[1:08:48] person in the Lord, you you are a dual
[1:08:50] being.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; I don't know what to preach, but you
[1:08:53] know there is
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; there is duality in a human being and
[1:08:57] the best duality you can have is when
[1:08:59] it's you and God.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; That is the best combination that a
[1:09:03] person can have and that is what the
[1:09:05] pastor has. So that is why every time
[1:09:07] pastor we come we know that whenever we
[1:09:10] come here we might spend 3 4 hours but
[1:09:12] we know that when we go back home
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; there is something that we have. So may
[1:09:17] the good lord bless you.
[1:09:19] [Applause]
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Thank thank you. Thank you doctor.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you. We we have a lot of testimony
[1:09:31] with my doctor here.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. But then that will be reserved for
[1:09:35] that time when it comes.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. So now I think we move over to the
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; I move over to the word of God.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; We'll welcome our pastor here.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Another son of the pastor.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. So when you when you are a
[1:09:56] father
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; and you have son and daughters
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; who are like this
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; what else can you ask for?
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; There's nothing God has given you
[1:10:06] abundantly.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; He has blessed you with life upon life
[1:10:10] and upon life.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; So with that let us just welcome the
[1:10:14] word of God with welcome. Welcome.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; And uh pastor will take over
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; then we'll
[1:10:22] take it from there. Uh sisters, can you
[1:10:25] lead us with welcome? Welcome.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Welcome.
[1:10:38] Holy Ghost,
[1:10:40] Holy
[1:10:42] Ghost,
[1:10:45] we will come
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:53] with power
[1:10:56] in
[1:10:57] [Music]
[1:11:03] Holy Ghost.
[1:11:05] Holy
[1:11:08] Ghost
[1:11:10] we welcome
[1:11:13] thee.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Uh let's pray.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; We heavenly father there's nothing else
[1:11:22] which we can say rather than to say
[1:11:24] thank you.
[1:11:26] uh
[1:11:28] when we ask most of the times sometimes
[1:11:31] we have some doubt but Lord you forgive
[1:11:34] us
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; because uh when we ask we know you're
[1:11:39] here
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; and here's a testimony that you have
[1:11:42] heard us our prayers
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; thank you father
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; as we are here celebrating let the holy
[1:11:50] ghost take control
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; but from the bottom of our hearts we
[1:11:55] Thank you Lord.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; As we committing everybody in here into
[1:11:59] thine holy hands in Jesus Christ name we
[1:12:01] pray. Amen.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh
[1:12:06] today I'll forgive you. I just want you
[1:12:08] to sit down. I'll read the word of God
[1:12:10] when you sit sitting down.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just relax. Uh
[1:12:15] um
[1:12:17] uh the problem is this that uh you know
[1:12:21] um
[1:12:24] when you when you take people
[1:12:28] uh somebody
[1:12:30] uh to be the last one to speak,
[1:12:34] you have to make sure that the one who
[1:12:35] speaking last knows how to speak.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:12:40] because now we have made these four
[1:12:42] people who are very good speakers to
[1:12:45] speak before me. Now I've got nothing to
[1:12:48] say. Uh the only thing which I can do is
[1:12:51] just to wipe my tears off my eyes.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:12:58] and the Lord has done us a good thing.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; A big one.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:08] The Lord has done us a big thing.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a big thing.
[1:13:14] Uh
[1:13:17] hey brother, there's nothing much I can
[1:13:20] say. Just say thank you Lord Jesus
[1:13:22] Christ.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh thank you Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Uh this is uh we we asked and he he has
[1:13:31] he listens. M
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; so but um
[1:13:35] uh the scripture which I'm very
[1:13:38] interested in is uh uh when I was pastor
[1:13:44] one day
[1:13:46] we have been we had been discussing
[1:13:48] scriptures
[1:13:50] according to the things which were
[1:13:51] happening in Malawi there.
[1:13:54] So
[1:13:55] we discussed we discussed we discussed
[1:13:59] uh
[1:14:02] So he said, "Ah, you you must be my
[1:14:04] friend." I said, "Oh, okay. That's fine,
[1:14:08] pastor. As long as you stand with the
[1:14:10] word, I'll stand with you."
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; So one day says, one day after we had
[1:14:14] already become friends like that, he
[1:14:16] says, "Ah, what you I should take you
[1:14:21] and introduce you to pastor Kodima."
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; That was 2014.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's when he took me to this
[1:14:28] very same house here uh to introduce me
[1:14:31] to pastor Kodima. Uh that was not my
[1:14:35] first time uh I saw pastor Kodima.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; No no no no no that's not whenever
[1:14:41] pastor Kodima comes to Malawi I don't
[1:14:43] know what was happening. The pastor
[1:14:45] would ask me to drive him around.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um,
[1:14:52] he has got a very special memory.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Too special. The memory is so good. So
[1:15:00] good. So good. I was driving him around
[1:15:04] 2009. Yeah. 2009
[1:15:08] 2010.
[1:15:10] Um
[1:15:12] uh in my house the doctrine is this that
[1:15:15] uh regardless of whatever is happening
[1:15:17] in other churches
[1:15:19] what other pastors are doing I don't
[1:15:20] want my children to know but I want my
[1:15:23] children to recite the
[1:15:25] the the
[1:15:28] scriptures of the prophet.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; So when my boys were very very young
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; so they were riding with pastor Kodima
[1:15:33] in the back was in the front and then
[1:15:36] they suddenly deciding hey dad. Yeah.
[1:15:41] The version 107 no that was long time
[1:15:44] ago. So after five or six years I met
[1:15:47] him says isn't you the brother who was
[1:15:50] carrying me and your children were
[1:15:51] reciting the scriptures. Yes that was
[1:15:54] me.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; So that was a very crispy memory because
[1:16:00] it was only that time which I had
[1:16:02] carried him around.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Uh but he was able to remember that
[1:16:06] thing which was very very
[1:16:09] close to me
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; and uh I said h this man has got a
[1:16:13] special memory because anybody else
[1:16:15] wouldn't have remembered that.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:19] So Jeremiah says Jeremiah 3:15 says
[1:16:24] um I will give you pastors
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; according to my heart which shall feed
[1:16:31] you with knowledge and understanding.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:37] Amen. Um,
[1:16:43] so when I I met Pastor Kodima,
[1:16:48] uh, I heard the rumors there in Malawi.
[1:16:50] Ah, no, Pastor Kima just preaches the
[1:16:53] same thing all the time. Preaches the
[1:16:54] same thing all the time. I said, okay,
[1:16:57] that's fine.
[1:16:59] Let me go and listen.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Only that to to see that their
[1:17:04] understanding is not there. Every time
[1:17:07] pastor Kim preaches doesn't preach the
[1:17:08] same thing.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Even if he leads the same sentence,
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Come and just come and listen again.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; He doesn't preach the same thing.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; He will take you the same book
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; again and again and again on the same on
[1:17:27] the same thing.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; You find that it's certain dimension.
[1:17:31] [Music]
[1:17:33] Mhm.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; That's why Jeremiah says
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; it's not only preaching the word,
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; there has to be understanding.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; There has to be understanding because
[1:17:44] remember
[1:17:46] they had followed him
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; for three and a half years. But their
[1:17:52] eyes of understanding were not opened
[1:17:55] until the book of acts when he opened he
[1:18:01] their
[1:18:02] understanding.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; But they should understand the
[1:18:05] scriptures.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; So quoting quoting the scriptures is
[1:18:09] fine
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; but understanding the scriptures is
[1:18:11] another level.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; That one you have to get it from
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; you're according to Jeremiah.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Where are you going to get it from?
[1:18:19] Awesome.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; You can leave the message, you can read
[1:18:21] the scriptures, you can quote, you can
[1:18:24] preach. But Jeremiah says, "I'll give
[1:18:27] you pastors accord
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; shall feed you with knowledge and
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; understanding."
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Understanding.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we come to this level of
[1:18:42] ministry
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; where there has to be understanding
[1:18:47] that's where a lot of us are going to
[1:18:49] fail
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; because that's where people try to
[1:19:01] emphasize on the minor you know Uh
[1:19:08] I I know you know this the when we uh oh
[1:19:13] I don't know how many of you know
[1:19:15] classical music.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; So we say this is a shyikoski
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; uh over 18 1812 1812
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; in D minor.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. So everyone understands what it
[1:19:33] is. So there is a D minor, there is also
[1:19:37] a major.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; So now the problem is this.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; If you don't have the understanding of
[1:19:44] the scripture,
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; you will see most of times you are so
[1:19:49] struck on the minor instead of missing
[1:19:51] the major.
[1:19:54] That's
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; The major
[1:20:01] The major is all of us to be like Jesus.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; To be like
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; So if I say I am Jesus,
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; am I wrong? No, no.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[1:20:21] you see
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; if people want want to see Jesus in the
[1:20:29] wrong way, where where should they go?
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; They should come to my house.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; If you want to see Jesus, where where
[1:20:39] should they go? To heaven.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; No. Hh.
[1:20:45] If people want to see Jesus,
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; where should they go?
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; They should come to my house to see
[1:20:51] Jesus.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; For Jesus is me.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; I am
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; If people wants to see me,
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; where they should where they should go?
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Meisedc was soil turned into a man. go
[1:21:13] and says he picked up soil
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; and he went into
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; stepped into it.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; So if you want to see me today, you go
[1:21:28] to heaven.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; It is here.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; So pastors
[1:21:37] after our our knowledge and
[1:21:40] understanding,
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; that's where the uh issue is. Uh I'm
[1:21:45] telling you the truth, church, love your
[1:21:48] pastor.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh sometimes when you preach the
[1:21:56] message and um
[1:22:01] uh I wanted to say something but let me
[1:22:04] stop you there. But uh your pastor can
[1:22:08] teach you very big things.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Very big things.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, if you don't want to listen to
[1:22:18] this one, just close your your
[1:22:24] um, pastor
[1:22:28] when he wakes up in the morning, he
[1:22:30] doesn't make he doesn't leave his bed un
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; even in the hotel.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Even in the hotel.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:45] I never did that. But nowadays, isn't
[1:22:47] it, Mom?
[1:22:53] The cleanest toilet in my house is mine,
[1:22:55] isn't it? I took it very, very well. But
[1:22:59] I took it after.
[1:23:03] That's right.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; In my house, the cleanest toilet is
[1:23:06] mine.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; But I took it after what I saw this man
[1:23:10] doing.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. That's right.
[1:23:15] My wife was were wondering you have made
[1:23:17] your bed to death. I didn't tell her
[1:23:18] what
[1:23:22] you made your bed today. I didn't know.
[1:23:24] Tell her you know these things they look
[1:23:26] simple.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; They look simple. Uh we I have learned a
[1:23:30] lot.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; I would have said something but if I had
[1:23:34] said I say it a meeting like this it
[1:23:36] will cause quite a lot of political
[1:23:38] problems.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; But this man
[1:23:42] You are sitting here. I'm telling the
[1:23:45] truth.
[1:23:47] I have seen men leaving the message of
[1:23:49] the hour.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; This man
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; lives the message of the hour.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we wanted to see Jesus,
[1:24:07] the Greeks wanted to see Jesus,
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Abraham says,
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; but they were disappointed.

[2:14:25] those time.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; When he started when there was nothing
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; and he preached the gospel,
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; he was on a bus moving distances,
[2:14:34] no resources whatsoever.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; But yet he had the zeal
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; that the message must reach every
[2:14:41] corner.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; And Lord, the message has reached every
[2:14:44] corner. Yes.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; We want to appreciate him as an elder.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; May you, dear God, enlarge
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; the days of his life.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; I remember dear God, when Sister Weber
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; was told that she was going to die,
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; and later on they were talking bad about
[2:15:00] the prophet.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; And sister Weber said, "You can't talk
[2:15:03] about the man of God like that." Amen.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; And right there, the angel of the Lord
[2:15:07] told brother
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; and say, "You go and tell sister,
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; I know what she said.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; When she stood for you,
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; she stood for me."
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Tell her that she won't die. Hallelujah.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; She will live again.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; And dear God, even now,
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; he is our elder.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; The devil has tried so many things, so
[2:15:30] ill health, so many challenges.
[2:15:31] Hallelujah. But we lift him up in
[2:15:33] prayer. Amen.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; And give him the strength, dear God,
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; to keep on leading your assembly.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; And even now, we under the authority of
[2:15:41] the word of God.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; As Hezekiah once said, it increase the
[2:15:45] days of my life. We can say, increase
[2:15:48] the days of pastor Gurima's life.
[2:15:51] Hallelujah.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; That dear God, may he be of profit to
[2:15:54] the body of Christ.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; We want to commit the family,
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; the student behind him.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; We want to commit his wife.
[2:16:03] She was there every step of the way. He
[2:16:07] knew what he went through. Hallelujah.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; And for that we want to appreciate them,
[2:16:11] dear God. And we pronounce a special
[2:16:13] blessing upon them as the amateur gods.
[2:16:17] We pronounce a special blessing upon the
[2:16:19] ministry. We pronounce special blessing
[2:16:22] upon them.
[2:16:24] Whatever Satan would want to do in the
[2:16:27] name of Jesus Christ, we abort every
[2:16:30] plan of the devil and make the pastor to
[2:16:33] be victorious.

[2:16:37] of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. Amen.
