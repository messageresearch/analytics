know our heart desire in the early hours of this morning I was listening to the prophet when he said he went somewhere in the delayed the body of a man when they do the calculation they realize that it went only it was but the very same body is giving us problems day by day so far ago we call upon the divine intervention this morning that brought you should heal each and every one no wonder the prophet he preached about the demons that torments us on a physical reality is exactly that 84 Cent body and he came again he speaks about the demon that torment us on a spiritual level follow God we came to a realization this morning that if you don't come and speak to us in a special way you don't visit our innermost we are all lost we invite you father and endless list of prayer requests where I read this morning the only reason that we read this morning because we have tried this and that and realize that you won't do anything without the intervention of God Heavenly Father visit the heart of each and every individuals that brought everything to your attention because they believe in you awake I know many did not have that opportunity them written and read before us but you know their heart answer experience there are others that are streaming and also if not get that opportunity but as our precious brother my sister was saying this morning saying Shalom to those that Wonder to see me their prayer requests as well I heard in heaven and after the prayer this morning we are expecting a testimony what I know about you God you're never disappointed us all this prayer requests is for edifying the holy church because we know when we when you answer we get more anchored in the weight we trust you more than yesterday we realize that some of the diseases Lord the doctors or the physician they cannot heal but when the Great physician is here everything is under control um [Music] each and every step that we take in our life may it be the step according to thy will for heavenly father if we can go without you both physically and spirituality and financially Lord because others this morning has presented before thee they have wet problem they have financial problem but where can we go is there no power in Gilead is there no healing here this morning I believe Lord we are at the right place whatever we have presented this morning when we leave we have received already I love the word of God when it says everything and everything has been completed and done before the foundation of the world what we are doing this morning is to access only what we have granted unto us maybe when maybe healing maybe anything you know Lord we just walk upon the path and the carpet that we have prepared before us through God as according to thy will we love you so much we approach the throne of Mercy we are going to hear the word of God this morning and you know heavenly father as you speak to us the previous Sunday so be it this Sunday as well we love you so much and we put everything under your control in the mighty name of our Lord and savior in Jesus Christ [Applause] God bless you with your mother we also have thanksgivings and also want to thank the Lord for the message God is always wonderful to use and we are so grateful for prayer and the support to enjoy from our preference amen [Music] also says traveled well from Durban this is pain and the legs also says the eye operation went well they started operations foreign foreign brought their request to the pastor addition and the pastor commissioned the elders to visit a sister and the sisters completely here [Applause] is asking he said their son has been healed from a high fever also says the Sun um amen amen I also have a testimony I want to read here is coming from Sister Josephine I have two testimonies I will go through them quick two months back and I think I've been there played for me as I had been feeling sick and the doctor said that I had a long coverage yes me and five members of family was attacked by covet in 2020. and by the grace of God we are here after prayer I was healed hundred percent health status the doctor said that he sees nothing wrong with me as all symptoms disappeared the second one is for her daughter sister sister has been very sick from a terrible pain in her stomach there was a time when she could not get out of bed she phoned the pasta and he prayed for her over the phone and said to her that she should come see him after Sunday service Santa when we prepared for service on Sunday the pain was severe pain and I told her that the devil doesn't want her to go to the service along the way thriving to grow from pain he just looked at him and told her to touch where the pain is to touch where the pain is Pastor asked him where the pain was my daughter tried in vain to trace the way about of the pain about success hey vanished without trees she moved from severe sickness to complete healing Instinct build even from minor pains that she has been experiencing the following day she was able to go to work after being booked sick for the whole week after witnessing this great manifestation of the way I called my elder daughter who later sent us a WhatsApp message saying the great physician now is amen [Applause] [Applause] we have sister Team B and matabelo for baptism analysis foreign [Applause] [Applause] amen [Applause] I believe there's also a video that he wants to play so if the brothers are ready God bless you peace be with you uh I have been given a task that is very Lula and that is very easy costs are not going to be answering questions just make statements okay what you see there is that I have requested to announce progress update regarding the new home for mamelodi assembly yes next slide okay come around the contents life okay we're going to look at you we all know that there has been talks and you have been contributing towards the building of a new church that is the first slide okay the second slide will refer to the building funds somehow the third slide is the challenges regarding the building fund the acquisition and the construction of the new science the fourth side refers to what is planned to be done regarding one two and three um okay those that don't know and have not had the opportunity to come to when the site was being inaugurated in 2019 the church acquired that site for 900 000. it is three hectares three hectares is almost three football grounds foreign okay and when we looked at what the value of that site is today according to the valuation by the municipality in 2020 the site is now worth 2.1 million [Music] um so we are saying 2.1 million plus there is work done of fencing of the land as well as some work 2.1 million um which you will see in the photo which was about 500 000. there is security that takes care of that problem because there had been signs of vandalism and because the place is and we had heavy rains it continuously grows now that side was used as a lodge before the church bought it and because it was first roofed it bent down sometime before we bought you will see in the picture site now that is the slide can you put a case technician that's the gate yes on your left hand side that road that you see going to that bend site that is the house so that length is about three it's just over three hectares next slide okay now the building fund that has been contributed over the years back it's now standing at 10 million that 3 13 million I was told is incorrect is you can put your hands together for yourself [Applause] now part of that of the funds were used as we will explain as we go down now when you buy a piece of land you have to involve Town municipality Town planners [Music] because they do long-term planes for all the areas okay now the pastor in the office says thank you very much for making the contribution [Applause] you can imagine what the pasta says thank you [Music] an honor I guess isn't it now the two of our fellow Believers made each serious contributions like I indicated the perimeter fence was about 500 000. it came from one family [Applause] see when you do a fence you put the foundation and all those things huge contributions foreign [Music] now when you every piece of land vacant land that you see must be rezoned by government rezoning you will explain what that means the freeway is you can build anything anyway the government says School playground something something and you can just when you like it build your double story day now that road that leads into the church the government said because there are going to be many cars coming there and that road is a public road you must whiten it you see when they built a garage in a shopping center you have to widen the roads and that then they gave us I think we have three quotations and the lowest says 13 million to do that [Music] we are not Oppenheimer so that 13 million would be better if we were contributing it towards the building not just widering the road and when the officials realize that [Music] then they realize that it's going to be costly let's look at another plane now this is the proposed Way Forward [Music] a building that is a ready move in property has been identified along Lane Wood Road some of you probably know it you will see when we show it it's been used as something before and then as a church now the owner the sellers are asking for 28 they asking for 30 plus Millions it's a bit on the high side so there's talks to see whether the church can acquire it for around 26 27 or so maybe even lower so available so remember that 10 million that is all already in the kitty now the decision was taken to sell that piece of land there yeah and the selling price is 2.8 million you can buy it it's in the public media property 24 Gumtree and the private property and so forth you can Google it you'll find it is there 2.84 private properties and then the pastor then said I don't want my church to read about it in the paper they must hear it fast from the pulpits okay amen thank you now they are also plans to sell this building here the estimate chain is about 6 million you could get more but six million rent that's the figure the office is looking at yeah now you can see that then there is a short form of nine Millions so if if the length is sold for 2.8 the change for six million to get to about 28 million there's a 9 million short form or repeatedly 28 million so there are discussions with the sellers to say they can push it down now remember the church is not the business it's not a PTY LTD rscc so there has to be a structure a legal structure that should buy the new entities yeah if you need the details you can check with the officials so that is almost in summation we gave you the story about the land they can plant where it is located the size what is being sold for what is happening and the challenges and the way forward in terms of making sure that we don't get there and get stuck and move forward from me but you can get clarity from the office [Applause] [Music] all right as we stand on our feet assignment to welcome our precious pastor and whatever you want to fight [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] bye -bye [Music] days [Music] [Music] [Music] all right ready foreign [Applause] [Music] YouTube thank you [Music] [Music] your heart [Music] s [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] me please [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] [Music] Christ [Music] information [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]
