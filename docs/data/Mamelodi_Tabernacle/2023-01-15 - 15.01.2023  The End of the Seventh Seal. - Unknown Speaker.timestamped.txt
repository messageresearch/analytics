[13:24] ings
[13:32] last time
[13:39] [Applause]
[13:47] let us bow
[13:52] let us bow our heads and pray
[13:57] gracious Lord
[14:00] your grace is sufficient to us
[14:05] power of the revealed weight is
[14:07] sufficient for us
[14:10] because
[14:12] it gives us the power of the Deadpool
[14:16] the world that is in our hearts as the
[14:20] prophet said
[14:21] the weight is now in the bright
[14:24] is sufficient for us
[14:27] it was sufficient for our Father Abraham
[14:32] it was sufficient to the apostles Paul
[14:35] Peter James and all of them
[14:39] and it was sufficient to our Prophet
[14:42] brother Brennan
[14:44] it is sufficient to our pastor Israel
[14:48] kodima
[14:49] and it is sufficient
[14:52] to the bride this morning Lord Almighty
[14:58] it's the way it said he that overcome it
[15:01] with 10 years overcome us father
[15:05] knowing the manifestations of the sons
[15:08] of God
[15:10] knowing that everything that was ever
[15:13] created
[15:14] is depending on us father
[15:17] so we need to have a very sufficient way
[15:22] that could release everything and
[15:24] restore everything back to where it was
[15:27] father we are so grateful Lord Almighty
[15:31] to acknowledge your presence in our
[15:33] hearts
[15:35] to acknowledge Lord Almighty your
[15:37] Revelation in the time that you are
[15:39] living in
[15:40] so we stand here
[15:43] as the sufficient Pride
[15:49] the word that he has given us it's
[15:51] sufficient to change our bodies Lord
[15:53] Almighty
[15:57] we know very well that this word is
[15:59] changing us
[16:01] from power to power
[16:04] From Grace to Grace
[16:06] from Faith to Faith
[16:09] until we go Lord
[16:12] hear the Distant Drums that they are no
[16:15] more distant Rhymes they are now here
[16:17] Lord Almighty
[16:20] gracious Lord
[16:23] is not demon
[16:25] that can ever
[16:27] penetrate in this church
[16:31] as the pastor used to say the devil is
[16:34] late
[16:35] because the book of The Seven Seas is
[16:38] now in the hands of the Bride
[16:42] and the bride knows what to do with it
[16:45] because it's the word of God
[16:48] and it's him and he knows what to do
[16:52] father we are so jubilant
[16:55] we are so happy
[16:58] to know who we are Lord
[17:01] and that that gives us faith upon Faith
[17:04] Lord
[17:05] thank you Father
[17:08] I always say
[17:11] there is no war there is no battle
[17:13] without a battle song
[17:16] as we are singing right now Lord
[17:18] Almighty
[17:20] laying a carpet for the weight that is
[17:22] coming Lord
[17:24] that reminds us of the Old Testament
[17:27] how they blew those trumpets Lord how
[17:31] they blew those instruments Lord
[17:33] how melodious were they Lord in your
[17:36] ears as it is right now father as we
[17:40] worship thee we are so grateful
[17:44] we know that we are capable
[17:47] we are not trying Lord we have overcome
[17:51] thank you Father
[17:53] may you
[17:55] take place Lord into the hearts of your
[17:58] believers
[17:59] and here is the pulpit
[18:02] the pasta is about to stand behind this
[18:05] pulpit
[18:06] I always say whenever there's a word of
[18:09] God it is an angel of God
[18:12] and whenever there's a revelation
[18:15] there's an angel of God
[18:18] father
[18:19] the angel is about to take control
[18:22] our hearts are open
[18:25] father
[18:27] may you take control
[18:29] may you bless our pastor
[18:32] as he will be bringing the word
[18:35] may you bless the church
[18:37] that comes before thee with Open Hearts
[18:41] may you bless everything that is going
[18:43] on here Lord
[18:45] thank you Father
[18:47] we are again repeating
[18:49] that the demons
[18:52] and the angels of the devil
[18:54] and the Devil Himself Lucifer
[18:57] they are late
[19:00] we have made it

[1:15:24] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:15:26] and on the back side
[1:15:28] sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a
[1:15:31] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:15:33] voice
[1:15:35] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:15:38] lose the cells thereof and no man in
[1:15:40] Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the
[1:15:43] Earth was able to open the book neither
[1:15:46] to look their own and I wept much
[1:15:49] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:15:52] and to read the book neither to look
[1:15:55] there on and one of the elders said unto
[1:15:58] me
[1:15:59] weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[1:16:03] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[1:16:06] to open the book and to lose the seven
[1:16:09] cells thereof
[1:16:11] and I behold I beheld in law in the
[1:16:14] midst of the throne and of the four
[1:16:17] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[1:16:19] stood a lamp as it had been slain having
[1:16:22] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[1:16:26] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[1:16:28] the Earth and he came and took the book
[1:16:31] out of the right hand of him that sat
[1:16:34] upon the throne
[1:16:37] uh I mean I mean okay

[1:24:11] look God bless brother

[1:24:22] and our brother a great gabrielson okay
[1:24:28] amen we've seen
[1:24:30] in the country the United States I want
[1:24:33] to go a United States we've seen Alabama
[1:24:36] and
[1:24:40] [Music]
[1:24:42] we even I said to the brothers
[1:24:45] you know there is my brothers somewhere
[1:24:48] there
[1:24:49] but I know
[1:24:51] God is also somewhere
[1:24:55] amen God will take care of them
[1:25:00] we were in California
[1:25:04] also under Flats uh
[1:25:09] when we were there maybe really cool
[1:25:13] we
[1:25:14] were sitting with the brothers
[1:25:17] and I think I was speaking to a brother
[1:25:23] how the prophet of God at one times
[1:25:27] pointed the fingers and
[1:25:33] he pointed at California as super
[1:25:36] California
[1:25:38] Los Angeles in Los Angeles and so forth
[1:25:43] and I said Karen but there's children of
[1:25:47] God
[1:25:50] all right amen when
[1:25:54] God started to point his finger at Sodom
[1:25:57] and Gomorrah tomorrow
[1:26:01] there was somebody there to be safe
[1:26:08] amen and God did that he saved his own
[1:26:13] apology
[1:26:16] that
[1:26:18] there's some predictions
[1:26:21] [Music]
[1:26:22] about the coming floods or fires amen
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:36] that's why we you know
[1:26:39] that our brothers foreign
[1:26:49] [Music]
[1:27:19] okay
[1:27:23] now I I I've got a jotted here the end
[1:27:28] of the beginning
[1:27:33] um
[1:27:34] I was looking at this word
[1:27:37] in the beginning
[1:27:39] was the way
[1:27:43] but now you've got to wind back
[1:27:49] and
[1:27:50] I'm sorry that I don't have it on a
[1:27:53] church
[1:27:56] in the beginning was the way
[1:28:00] are you watching my looking at my
[1:28:02] fingers
[1:28:11] are you watching my fingers
[1:28:20] amen
[1:28:41] so you can fold it back like that okay
[1:28:44] okay
[1:28:47] because God has got no beginning
[1:28:52] amen amen that's why when he approached
[1:28:55] Abraham
[1:28:57] um
[1:29:05] why especially
[1:29:09] to Abraham
[1:29:11] and how he dealt with Abraham
[1:29:15] the one who has no father no mother
[1:29:20] [Music]
[1:29:22] because that is the only Ministry that
[1:29:26] Abraham would understand amen
[1:29:33] if in his full page in your eye the
[1:29:37] message is brought forth to him by his a
[1:29:40] person
[1:29:44] who has no father
[1:29:46] no mother that's not me
[1:29:50] and that's why now Matthew fine
[1:29:55] cannot hear any message because
[1:30:13] now that's why the secret
[1:30:16] under the seventh seeds
[1:30:21] it says
[1:30:23] when he opened the seventh section
[1:30:27] what happened
[1:30:30] silence
[1:30:40] now that's why he says
[1:30:48] amen
[1:30:49] because the activities
[1:30:55] and then
[1:30:57] the the man yeah
[1:30:59] who has forfeited the book
[1:31:02] as we are looking here how
[1:31:07] uh they look for somebody
[1:31:12] who was
[1:31:14] eligible
[1:31:17] take the book yeah
[1:31:19] from the one that said
[1:31:24] the book was there but
[1:31:28] they were God was waiting for somebody
[1:31:37] because if we read in the Bible
[1:31:41] okay let me read you something here
[1:31:44] if I've got it here with me amen
[1:31:48] and
[1:31:50] if I don't have it I'm just going to
[1:31:52] quote to you
[1:31:55] where it says
[1:31:58] Satan Satan
[1:32:00] was the god of
[1:32:02] every
[1:32:07] now if you go back help while I'm around
[1:32:09] you realize that uh
[1:32:12] Lucifer Lucifer
[1:32:16] who was the right hand man of God
[1:32:22] and then after his fall
[1:32:25] he was cast down to the Earth
[1:32:31] now remember
[1:32:35] who was
[1:32:37] who had the
[1:32:39] booker the book was given to the men
[1:32:42] Adam
[1:32:46] Lucifer yeah Lucifer was the right hand
[1:32:49] man
[1:32:52] of God
[1:32:54] but after he rebelled
[1:32:58] and the Bible says he was cast
[1:33:09] now when he arrives
[1:33:13] because
[1:33:14] he had a post
[1:33:18] position he was looking for a job again
[1:33:25] he saw Adam
[1:33:29] was there to mend the garden
[1:33:33] and uh
[1:33:36] that was the position
[1:33:40] so he thought of taking that position
[1:33:42] from Adam
[1:33:47] this is what he did he says
[1:33:50] then he became the God of this Israeli
[1:33:54] World facility
[1:33:59] not the god of the earth
[1:34:03] you know the Bible says God formed the
[1:34:07] Earth
[1:34:14] now the world is this yes
[1:34:39] let us just talk
[1:34:42] and then we realized that
[1:34:47] in the Bible more be willing every time
[1:34:52] God when he created
[1:34:55] then he said let us make men
[1:35:01] and there was no other image
[1:35:03] but he said in our image
[1:35:09] all right amen then afterwards he said
[1:35:23] I mean
[1:35:24] now it takes me back to where I read the
[1:35:29] prophet
[1:35:33] man is the other part of the contract
[1:35:36] foreign
[1:35:50] when God
[1:35:52] after he created something
[1:35:55] then he would send it to Adam
[1:36:00] Adam was part of the country
[1:36:05] is that right
[1:36:07] amen even today
[1:36:09] you came here

[1:37:21] is this
[1:37:23] just by holding

[1:37:31] then the disease

[1:51:04] how can I really
[1:51:05] something that has got no eternal life
[1:51:13] when I was born I was a baby

[1:53:22] slavery
[1:53:30] don't do this
[1:53:36] but if you look at the Sheep
[1:53:39] when it is
[1:53:50] and the lady can say come around that's
[1:53:53] why I quit
[1:53:56] they want you to put on rulers
[1:54:03] but the man is not like a ship
[1:54:08] that's right but if you are a child
[1:54:14] amen because a sheep cannot look after
[1:54:17] it
[1:54:21] it needs a guy
[1:54:23] that's a sheep but we are children of

[1:55:37] from the word there was no one mode
[1:55:45] until it cost John to whip
[1:55:50] because there was no one waiting meaning
[1:55:58] the entire
[1:56:00] everybody
[1:56:03] in heaven
[1:56:05] they they were looking at that
[1:56:08] the book of redemption
[1:56:14] amen that's why the prophet said
[1:56:21] if it is now
[1:56:39] you know what happened when
[1:56:44] Adam hey Adam forfeited the book
