[1:04:01] Angelina Reeba born on the 11th of
[1:04:04] August 1947 in Coltonville. The first
[1:04:08] daughter of the late Mr. Damini and the
[1:04:10] late Elizabeth Hu. She is survived by
[1:04:13] her three siblings. In 1965, she married
[1:04:19] Mr. Simon Reeba and together they were
[1:04:21] blessed with six children, 15
[1:04:24] grandchildren, and 21 great
[1:04:27] grandchildren.
[1:04:28] She was a woman of strength, courage,
[1:04:32] and deep faith in the Lord. Through
[1:04:34] life's challenges, she remained
[1:04:37] resilient and steadfast, always trusting
[1:04:40] God. Her love, prayers, and wisdom
[1:04:45] shaped generations.
[1:04:47] Though we are saddened by her passing,
[1:04:50] we celebrate her legacy of faith, love,
[1:04:53] and resilience. She will forever remain

[1:17:35] 8
[1:17:39] only verse 23. Verse 23.
[1:18:00] Amen. Amen. And he said unto them, you
[1:18:03] are from beneath. I'm from above. You
[1:18:06] are of this world. I'm not of this
[1:18:08] world. You may be seated.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; So this morning at the funeral of our
[1:18:18] mother,
[1:18:20] we want to comfort the family,
[1:18:24] everyone that was close to her.
[1:18:27] Just same few words from the Bible.
[1:18:31] We are still on time.
[1:18:34] We must leave the area at 9:00.
[1:18:38] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; So I want to share with you this morning
[1:18:43] title.
[1:18:45] You you will worship God from your
[1:18:48] origin.
[1:18:53] I want to be honest with you this
[1:18:55] morning.
[1:19:00] day you were baptized
[1:19:03] not the day you started worshiping God
[1:19:07] you worship God
[1:19:10] from where you come from
[1:19:13] you have the origin
[1:19:16] and from there on you started worshiping
[1:19:19] him
[1:19:21] in this flesh is the continuity
[1:19:25] when the flesh dies eyes.
[1:19:28] You don't stop, you continue worshiping.
[1:19:33] Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; That's all about it.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; That is why when Jesus Christ meet these
[1:19:42] people that read the Bible, the scribes,
[1:19:48] [Music]
[1:19:49] you know, the Pharisees
[1:19:51] and the tax collectors,
[1:19:54] he he tell them straight.
[1:19:57] You are from beneath
[1:20:00] and from above.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; He was telling them of their origin.
[1:20:09] Amen. Amen.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; A child of God to begin with
[1:20:14] is a child of God. Even now is a child
[1:20:17] of God. Even after death, a child of
[1:20:21] God. But a sinner
[1:20:24] sinner to begin with
[1:20:27] today will be a sinner after death.
[1:20:34] [Music]
[1:20:35] For the Bible says, there was a war in
[1:20:38] heaven. When there was a war in heaven
[1:20:42] according to Revelation 12,
[1:20:45] every one of us, every one of us here,
[1:20:50] you took a stand.
[1:20:53] And when you fight, you fight from that
[1:20:57] position.
[1:20:59] You you you fight from the stand you
[1:21:01] take.
[1:21:05] If you were on the wrong side,
[1:21:09] you cannot be in the right side of God
[1:21:12] today.
[1:21:15] Life is continuing.
[1:21:20] Amen. Amen. God allowed us
[1:21:24] in this world to show ourselves
[1:21:28] to who we are.
[1:21:32] I want to give you few example.
[1:21:35] from you know the life in the Old
[1:21:36] Testament
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; is not the same
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; as the life in the New Testament
[1:21:45] and the life in the New Testament is not
[1:21:49] the same as our life today.
[1:21:53] The Bible consist of Old Testament,
[1:21:58] New Testament, and it's a complete book.
[1:22:04] We call it a Bible.
[1:22:06] We are living at the backside of the
[1:22:09] Bible.
[1:22:11] We are another generation.
[1:22:14] Amen. Amen. In the Old Testament,
[1:22:19] the devil has access
[1:22:23] to everything.
[1:22:25] He can bewitch you. He can raise you
[1:22:28] from the dead. He can report you to God.
[1:22:33] He can do anything he want.
[1:22:35] That was the life of the Old Testament.
[1:22:40] In the New Testament,
[1:22:42] something different in our time.
[1:22:45] Something different. Let's look this
[1:22:48] thing through the Bible.
[1:22:52] Amen. Amen.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to read the scriptures,
[1:22:56] but I'll just quote when you are at
[1:22:59] home,
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; you can read them. There was a time more
[1:23:03] Job 2 verse1
[1:23:07] where the children of God were coming to
[1:23:10] God.
[1:23:17] And the Bible says even Satan
[1:23:21] had an opportunity to report
[1:23:26] and he was reporting the children of
[1:23:28] God. And the report of the devil is
[1:23:32] always negative.
[1:23:36] He was a negative man to begin with.
[1:23:40] There's nothing good.
[1:23:42] He can tell God
[1:23:45] about you. But the only thing that we
[1:23:48] can speak to God about
[1:23:51] God, you overprotected that man.
[1:23:57] God, I heard him lying yesterday.
[1:24:02] God, I heard him thinking of negative
[1:24:05] things yesterday.
[1:24:08] Work of the devil. When the children of
[1:24:11] God come before God appreciating him,
[1:24:16] Tell him how much they love you but not
[1:24:19] the devil.
[1:24:21] Be careful if you are always saying
[1:24:23] negative things.
[1:24:26] If you are not at the footstep of the
[1:24:28] devil
[1:24:30] and there are those people in life when
[1:24:33] they talk, you just get bored
[1:24:37] because you know there's nothing good
[1:24:39] they going to talk about.
[1:24:42] They are negative.
[1:24:44] were negative to begin with.
[1:24:50] They are that was the work of the devil.
[1:24:54] You protected Job
[1:24:57] Isaiah
[1:25:00] is a sinner.
[1:25:01] That man is a sinner and God was just
[1:25:04] listening because God is a good God. He
[1:25:08] knows that is his time and I will leave
[1:25:12] it like that. But it's not a perfect
[1:25:14] time.
[1:25:16] I changed
[1:25:18] things.
[1:25:21] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:29] Amen. So God allowed
[1:25:35] Amen.
[1:25:38] Chapter 28 Chapter 28- 17
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; verse 7-1 17
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; it speaks about a woman of
[1:25:47] a devilship
[1:25:53] get access as well.
[1:25:56] Amen. To do whatever
[1:26:00] she can do. Amen. And one of the days
[1:26:05] Saul asked her to raise someone from the
[1:26:08] dead and she did. And you will be
[1:26:12] surprised how can a sang
[1:26:16] raise a prophet of God from the dead.
[1:26:20] God was just looking and say is there
[1:26:23] time? I will just leave it like that.
[1:26:26] But that time one of the days it will
[1:26:29] come to an end. God knew about it and he
[1:26:33] let it go and they thought they were on
[1:26:37] top of their game. But the time come and
[1:26:43] the time will pass.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God was just looking at that. You
[1:26:50] know if uh we we have we have
[1:26:54] shortteered
[1:26:57] and if God has shortteer like us
[1:27:02] This world could have end long time ago
[1:27:07] but God is patience.
[1:27:10] That's why patience
[1:27:12] is one of the virtue.
[1:27:15] If you have patience,
[1:27:17] you have it go.
[1:27:20] Amen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; So God knew and let it go.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you read first kings chapter
[1:27:29] 22
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; verse 19-23
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; verse 19-23
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; the Bible says there was a meeting
[1:27:39] in heaven that's why I'm saying you
[1:27:42] worship
[1:27:44] from your place of origin
[1:27:48] amen when there was a meeting in heaven
[1:27:53] we found this was activity here on
[1:27:57] Amen. Amen. Ahab wanted to go and fight
[1:28:03] and he insisted.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; God didn't like them. Then he called a
[1:28:08] meeting in heaven.
[1:28:10] When he called a meeting, one was saying
[1:28:13] this, another one was saying this. But
[1:28:17] the Bible says another spirit
[1:28:21] come before God and said to God, I will
[1:28:25] go and convince him to go to war
[1:28:30] so that he can die. And God said, how we
[1:28:34] going to do it?
[1:28:36] He said to God, I will put a lying
[1:28:38] spirit
[1:28:41] in his prophets.
[1:28:43] Those prophets will lie.
[1:28:47] and persuaded he persuaded him
[1:28:51] go to war. But where did this occur?
[1:28:56] In heaven. A lying spirit
[1:29:00] in heaven. Then God said to the lying
[1:29:02] spirit
[1:29:04] go. Then the lying spirit come down here
[1:29:08] and get into the prophet.
[1:29:12] And then the prophet started to
[1:29:14] prophesy. a prophet. Be careful when you
[1:29:18] are say you are a prophet or having the
[1:29:21] gift of the prophet
[1:29:23] doesn't have the lying spirit.
[1:29:27] You can lie to the people
[1:29:30] but you claiming to be the prophet.
[1:29:33] Not all the prophet are the prophet from
[1:29:36] God.
[1:29:38] prophet have the lying spirit
[1:29:42] and they will persuade you to do the
[1:29:45] wrong things.
[1:29:48] Amen.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When something is happening
[1:29:51] here on earth
[1:29:54] activity in
[1:29:56] there's a meeting in heaven
[1:29:59] about you.
[1:30:01] Job experienced it
[1:30:03] like I experienced.
[1:30:06] There was a meeting in heaven.
[1:30:08] But there's a meeting in heaven about
[1:30:12] you. No wonder
[1:30:15] of God to protect you.
[1:30:19] The devil will do you know how because
[1:30:22] you worship from the right place
[1:30:26] from the place of your origin.
[1:30:28] If you're a child of God to begin with,
[1:30:32] you will remain a child of God. You will
[1:30:35] die being a child of God.
[1:30:37] Nothing can change you.
[1:30:41] So why are you worried this morning? If
[1:30:44] you are a sinner, I cannot change you.
[1:30:47] You will die s. And when you wake up
[1:30:50] from the dead, you will wake up being a
[1:30:53] sinner
[1:30:55] because the stand that you took
[1:31:00] when there was a war in heaven.
[1:31:04] That is why in the message of this hour
[1:31:08] we just say Lord God you know better.
[1:31:13] You pray harder.
[1:31:16] You fast you come to church. You do
[1:31:19] anything brothers and sisters doesn't
[1:31:23] going to change your status with God.
[1:31:29] Now tell me why are you woring this way?
[1:31:35] Because a complete job was done.
[1:31:40] Bible says the lamb was slain before the
[1:31:45] foundation of the world.
[1:31:48] What is the work of the lamb
[1:31:50] to die so that our sins
[1:31:54] can be forgiven?
[1:31:56] That means God knew very well. He will
[1:32:00] come to this earth.
[1:32:02] The sinful world will be shaped in
[1:32:05] iniquity.
[1:32:07] He will forgive us because he forgiven
[1:32:10] us before the foundation.
[1:32:16] Amen. Amen. Amen. God knew all those
[1:32:19] things and he started to prepare
[1:32:24] when you walk is God working. That is
[1:32:27] the ministry
[1:32:29] behind the Bible.
[1:32:31] But the ministry in the Bible in the New
[1:32:35] Testament is God with them. The ministry
[1:32:40] of the Old Testament was God above them.
[1:32:44] Ministry today was God in us.
[1:32:48] When you want to see God,
[1:32:51] look at us.
[1:32:53] We are God incarnate.
[1:32:56] I'm talking
[1:32:58] about God who created heaven and earth.
[1:33:02] He's in us
[1:33:04] [Music]
[1:33:07] is the ministry behind
[1:33:10] the Bible.
[1:33:12] Don't despise yourself.
[1:33:15] You are more than natural.
[1:33:19] As I was saying yesterday,
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; sister Ford sister the brotherham says
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; he was the poorest of the poor.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; But brother Brenham says is in heaven.
[1:33:37] For we say
[1:33:39] everything that you see with the naked
[1:33:43] eye
[1:33:44] beginning
[1:33:46] to
[1:33:48] all the wealth of the world
[1:33:51] acquire all
[1:33:54] you will leave them behind
[1:33:57] because they are tempor.
[1:34:01] [Music]
[1:34:07] God took them and at the right time God
[1:34:11] give them back to you. God was just
[1:34:13] trying to show you
[1:34:16] give you I can tell you I can give you
[1:34:21] I want to tell you this morning
[1:34:24] there's no neutral place.
[1:34:28] It's either you worship God or you
[1:34:32] worship Satan.
[1:34:37] And there are people, many people that
[1:34:41] worship Satan, but having the Bible in
[1:34:44] their head.
[1:34:46] But the Bible is not a confirmation
[1:34:50] of someone who a worshiper.
[1:34:53] A worship is someone who was a worshiper
[1:34:58] to begin with.
[1:35:02] Jesus was talking to the people.
[1:35:05] that knows the Bible that can quote the
[1:35:08] Bible. We call them priests
[1:35:12] high priest
[1:35:14] scribes. What we call intelligence of
[1:35:16] the day.
[1:35:19] He said to them, "You are from beneath."
[1:35:26] When they worship,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; they worship from beneath
[1:35:32] there's nothing they can do because the
[1:35:35] stand you took that day
[1:35:38] is the one that will sustain you.
[1:35:43] Amen. Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; You sustained by the stent you took that
[1:35:47] time.
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:52] Once more I say, why are you worrying
[1:35:55] today?
[1:35:57] What are you trying to make yourself?
[1:36:00] I'm telling you, relax.
[1:36:05] Relax in the word of God. A complete job
[1:36:10] was done. Just walk upon the path that
[1:36:15] God has created.
[1:36:20] Hey, they hate me. They don't want to
[1:36:23] talk to me. They don't want to phone me.
[1:36:26] They don't want to do this.
[1:36:28] Oh my. You will be admitted to the
[1:36:32] hospital.
[1:36:37] But if you can just say, "Lord God, you
[1:36:40] know it's better.
[1:36:44] Just continue.
[1:36:46] There's nothing and nothing in this
[1:36:49] world that you're going to change. You
[1:36:52] can change everything, anything.
[1:36:56] Everything that is happening meant to be
[1:36:59] like that.
[1:37:05] Even your prayer
[1:37:07] cannot change anything.
[1:37:09] If you think your prayer change
[1:37:12] something, I want to tell you this.
[1:37:16] It's not your prayer. It's God's prayer.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; He was accusing us
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; in the Old Testament. God gave him the
[1:37:31] opportunity. But when we come to the New
[1:37:34] Testament,
[1:37:36] ah, we met the master of the universe.
[1:37:40] I'm glad saying yesterday. The man of
[1:37:44] God says, "I've been all over the world.
[1:37:49] I've seen the religion of the people.
[1:37:52] I was in India.
[1:37:55] I saw how they worship.
[1:37:59] How they worship
[1:38:03] God,
[1:38:05] you know, in America, all those things.
[1:38:09] When I was looking all over the world, I
[1:38:11] want to tell you this.
[1:38:15] is at the highest level
[1:38:19] because the one we worship
[1:38:22] Jesus Christ died at the cross
[1:38:26] in the tomb
[1:38:28] that day is risen
[1:38:31] where it has ever happened in the human
[1:38:33] race.
[1:38:37] Never since the world began
[1:38:42] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:46] follow that man was one of the days
[1:38:50] in Christ
[1:38:53] the resurrection is with the Lord Jesus
[1:38:56] Christens
[1:39:00] they've tried you can't wake up change
[1:39:04] your was
[1:39:07] there in the tomb.
[1:39:10] But where is the tomb of Jesus Christ?
[1:39:13] Open until the the soldiers were bought
[1:39:20] for lie
[1:39:21] stolen. They give money. This thing this
[1:39:26] thing of robbery
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; did not start today. Amen. did not start
[1:39:33] today.
[1:39:36] Amen. Amen. He started long time.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He started there. But you cannot
[1:39:46] hide the word of God.
[1:39:48] The more they receive those
[1:39:54] get exposed.
[1:39:57] You know
[1:39:59] the word of God exposes everything.
[1:40:02] Because the word of God is light.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; When you are a liar,
[1:40:08] you become more exposed.
[1:40:12] When you are a sinner, you become more
[1:40:14] exposed
[1:40:16] because the word of God exposes
[1:40:18] everything.
[1:40:23] When you are a Christian, you get
[1:40:26] exposed.
[1:40:27] These people started to see your life.
[1:40:30] your life changing people's life
[1:40:35] because we are here to impart life.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; As I was listening here
[1:40:45] is saying she was just looking at
[1:40:50] just looking and leave. The following
[1:40:54] day she will look at her and leave and
[1:40:58] the third day and the fourth day maybe
[1:41:00] the fifth day that's when she said mama
[1:41:04] just tell me your secret
[1:41:06] you are alive is lied and we are here
[1:41:11] impart life
[1:41:13] they're liars they impart lives
[1:41:18] who they are
[1:41:20] who we are
[1:41:22] we are preaching in the sermon.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; But we are living.
[1:41:27] [Music]
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; When you leave a sermon,
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; you change
[1:41:35] the people's life.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:41:44] Ephesians chapter 4,
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4 7-12,
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; the Bible speaks about Jesus Christ.
[1:41:51] He said, it says he descended
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; to the lower part
[1:41:58] and he ascended
[1:42:02] to the highest.
[1:42:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; That was our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; You know what he was doing? people that
[1:42:11] disbelieve the message
[1:42:14] during the time of Lord of Abraham of
[1:42:19] Noah of Enoch.
[1:42:23] He found them.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; He found them at the lower part.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; When you descend, you go down. And Jesus
[1:42:33] Christ said, "You are from
[1:42:36] beneath. You are from beneath.
[1:42:40] Amen.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; And they worship
[1:42:43] from beneath. We worship from above.
[1:42:49] Then he preached to them. The message
[1:42:51] that he preached to them was not the
[1:42:54] message of repentance
[1:42:56] because the message of repentance
[1:42:59] was for the children of God because they
[1:43:02] meant to repent.
[1:43:06] When Jesus died on the cross,
[1:43:09] did not die for every boat as we
[1:43:12] normally say
[1:43:14] died for those who took their part
[1:43:21] to Revelation 12.
[1:43:24] The rest you can preach it in your
[1:43:26] churches.
[1:43:29] He did not die for you. He died for
[1:43:32] those that were on the side.
[1:43:35] [Music]
[1:43:36] Those that were on the side of Lucifer,
[1:43:40] they can pray and pray hard
[1:43:45] and worship hard
[1:43:47] money.
[1:43:50] That does not going to make them
[1:43:52] Christian
[1:43:54] is going to make them good citizens
[1:43:58] citizens are not Christian but
[1:44:01] Christianity
[1:44:03] something else.
[1:44:08] You worship from your place of origin.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Then they saw him
[1:44:15] coming there.
[1:44:18] They say, "Lord, it's time now. You see
[1:44:22] the demons knows him. They say, "Lord,
[1:44:27] now you are going to finish us off." Oh,
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; they knew.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Then he said to them, "No,
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; I'm just coming here to tell you,
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; remember is Lord Jesus,
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; when you deny Noah,
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; you were denying me.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; When you deny Abraham,
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; you were denying me. When you deny
[1:44:56] Enoch, you were denying.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; If you deny the preaching this morning,
[1:45:06] you are denying him.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; He was telling them that. And when he
[1:45:14] get there, he broke the backbone of the
[1:45:17] devil.
[1:45:18] When he broke the backbone of the devil,
[1:45:21] he took the keys of death. took the keys
[1:45:24] of heaven. That means from that time he
[1:45:28] has the power to kill. He has the power
[1:45:32] to take you to hell. I want to tell you
[1:45:34] this morning
[1:45:36] this message that I'm preaching this
[1:45:38] morning
[1:45:40] power take you
[1:45:44] the power take you heaven.
[1:45:48] Amen. Because I accepted to be the
[1:45:52] vessel for God this morning to speak to
[1:45:55] you. Deny me. You are denying God.
[1:46:01] That's what Jesus said. You denied Noah.
[1:46:05] You denied Eno. You denied Abraham. You
[1:46:08] denied me. Same thing today.
[1:46:12] You denied the word of God. You denied
[1:46:15] he.
[1:46:16] Forunate part. If you are not of the
[1:46:19] repentance,
[1:46:22] you will never repent. You will even go
[1:46:24] home saying yes
[1:46:28] because that's who you are. But one will
[1:46:31] go home and say I want to join my army.
[1:46:35] That's where I belong. That's where I
[1:46:37] worship. That's what God has spoke to me
[1:46:41] special.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; There's no neutral.
[1:46:45] Either you deny
[1:46:47] you believe but it's up to you. God has
[1:46:50] done it all.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Last scripture.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; I love this scripture. Revelation
[1:47:03] chapter 12
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; verse 10.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Verse 10.
[1:47:09] The Bible says
[1:47:11] the accuser
[1:47:14] of our brethren was cast down.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; You know what does that mean? The
[1:47:21] accuser
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; of the brethren does not have power over
[1:47:26] them anymore.
[1:47:29] He does not have access to heaven
[1:47:31] anymore.
[1:47:33] He cannot go to the sixth dimension or
[1:47:35] sixth dimension.
[1:47:37] dimension.
[1:47:39] Amen. Amen. He will remain in the fifth
[1:47:43] dimension. And God has given us the keys
[1:47:48] of death and hell. And when he give us
[1:47:52] death, he give us the keys to heaven
[1:47:56] that means this morning as a children of
[1:47:58] God, you can go to hell and come back.
[1:48:02] You can go to heaven and come back. You
[1:48:06] can die and come back. God has given us
[1:48:09] all
[1:48:11] this morning. We are not just
[1:48:13] conquerors.
[1:48:15] But we are more than conquerors.
[1:48:17] He met there at that time in the Old
[1:48:22] Testament. Before Jesus come, they had
[1:48:25] opportunity
[1:48:27] doing whatever they want with you until
[1:48:30] the day of the paradise.
[1:48:34] separated it from that time we no longer
[1:48:38] have access.
[1:48:40] [Music]
[1:48:42] Amen. Amen. But we can go anywhere
[1:48:47] anytime
[1:48:49] for we have the keys
[1:48:51] of heaven. We have the keys of hell and
[1:48:55] death.
[1:48:57] Jesus Christ himself gave it to us. A
[1:49:00] child of God. Worry not.
[1:49:04] Everything is in place.
[1:49:08] God bless you.
[1:49:10] Amen. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; I love that song.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Will close for us.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; And then we'll proceed to the prayer.
[1:49:30] Amen.
[1:49:32] Give us strength.
[1:49:35] Healing.

[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Even this morning, you will still stay
[1:52:27] take a stand with God.
[1:52:30] If you never took a stand with God from
[1:52:33] the beginning, if you were against God,
[1:52:37] even this morning, you will still say
[1:52:39] this is nothing.
