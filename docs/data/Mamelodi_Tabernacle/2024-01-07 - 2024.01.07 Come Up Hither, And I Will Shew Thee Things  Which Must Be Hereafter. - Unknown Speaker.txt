Description:
Title: Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on the 07th January 2024.
The Pastor read the following scriptures:

Revelation 4:1-2
Revelation 21: 9-11
Revelation 8:1

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about things to come down to the earth from heaven.
The first day of the week is to come and see Him, because Sunday is the resurrection day.

John was taken up from the seven church ages and received the messages after he was taken out of the Church Ages.

The only Men who met Melchisedec was Abraham. Melchisedec visited Abraham as a Men. Melchisedec is God, when he visited Abraham he was Melchisedec, when he saves the people he becomes Jesus, when he took the book he become a Lamb. The lamb took the book within himself, as the father was within himself. 

God operate from a throne to a throne.
1st Throne is in Heaven, 2nd in Jesus and 3rd is in a Man. God uses a throne to address his people.

Man is an angel with a small letter “a”. The Angels came down to the earth when the Seventh Seal was opened. 
You need to come to a place where you will be able to see things to come , meaning that you can't see those things at any other place, you need to be at a specific place to see them. They can’t be seen in a Church, you must be out of the church ages to see them.

The prophet had to go west to receive a message from the Angel. So that he can bring those things to the bride not to the church. There are so many things coming to the church such as separation. If the message is not from the groom then is not for the bride, it can be for the church but not the bride, for the bride it must be from the groom. The bride has a bridegroom.

After the Church ages, a messenger was called up, God keeps time with his people. 
Someone must be summon to receive the message for the next time. come after the church ages I will show you things to come to the bride. 
Every service must b...

moment the elders will tell me when the pastor is around because I just want to give you the report if you send someone if you send someone somewhere expecting to get a feedback so when most of the time I'm not around here know that I'll be out there assisting the children of God I took some trip with some brothers start witho I was with brother because the Pastor said we must go and assist this side the pastor that side by the name of Pastor M SP to our pastor to come and minister in his church [Music] the Pastor said we must go and assist they had some questions so we answered through the the seron it was on a Saturday afternoon Sunday morning requested us to to tell them about the true baptism we did so after service we baptized 11 Souls the are so I've had I was talking to T this week again he said we must come again so be with us in prayer as will be visiting them again amen amen so the previous week we were invited again in the cville area and then we preach the word of God Seven Souls responded positively to the weight so we are going to baptize them so the previous week we were in L God was with us on the way if you go to an area you just see when you are going on the way whether it's a blessed Journey or not because when we arrive at the border you know there was a lot of C because it's a new year when we crossed the South African border being on the que police from on the other side they pull out my car and then I thought maybe they want to search only to find that they are giving me another you know entrance the VIP amen then I thought maybe the the others will follow and then they stop the other cars but allow me to enter I said that means this journey is blessed so we arrive safely in the area and then we preach the word on we we ared Saturday Sunday and Monday God blessed us with 11 Souls once small that joined the army of God so one thing that surprised me as our brother was baptizing two kids girls between the age of 10 and 12 somewhere there you know when you look at a child you think this one need not to be baptized because he's still young so one of the sisters said no but you will get baptized next time for today wait then those two girls said no when coming to the word of God there's no child or elderly and they were God baptized while we are still surprised that was Sunday Monday after after the service their mom and their elder sister God baptized so the other the entire family okay so the pastor is here may God richly bless you the children of of God in appreciate the present that you normally give love you so much and keep on praying for them but I loveed when we get there they consistently coming to the church amen amen may God richly bless you as we sing a worshiping song that welcome our pastor to the ppit

from the seventh Church age from the ages and he received this message after he was taken up from the seventh churched come up here I'll show you come if we may read that scripture God bless you rather let us have our Elder here for a prayer I really wanted to pray but I sent something already so our Elder before the proceedings right gracious Heavenly Father this is a wonderful moment that we have come to Lord whereby father our souls are in Jubilee Amen to know that father this is the time for the Eagles to receive from the big amen gracious Heavenly Father this is a powerful word that you have given to us Lord yes in this special Ministry we like to thank you Father that one day the Bible says Jesus when he shouted father when he was in the cross of Calvary when he shouted powerfully the graves were open and the father the old Saints father they were seen with their glorious bodies Hallelujah father people they saw them because that was a powerful word that was uttered by our Lord Jesus Christ yes this is still the same word father that will be brought father through the mouth of the pastor but we know that is God himself is Meed himself within him that will address US father this morning bless this word oh Lord and the Devil is a loser he can't do anything to this word because already the seven SE is within us it has been revealed my father it has been placed the word is in the bride so father we like to thank you that the proceeding of the word will go according to the plan of the Lord until at the end bless our pastor and bless the bride and bless father everyone all over the globe who are going to listen to this way from this Pulpit we give you the glory and honor in the name of Jesus amen amen Revelation 4 verse 1 to 2 and uh also Revelation 21 come on I will show you the bread and Revelation one starting with chapter uh 4 Revelation 4: 1 to2 after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which say come up hether and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne Revelation chapter 21 from verse 9 to 11 and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God having the glory of God and her light was like unto the the stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear and Crystal amen amen you may be seated and uh finally oh let's read the thir one re Revelation 8 verse1 Revelation 8 verse 1 amen and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour yes sir amen uh you can take your seats now thanks for the song this morning amen amen it's for the uh what do you call them the the Seed of Abraham are you saying the Seed of Abraham yeah the Seed of Abraham Abraham amen so I see people are coming in getting baptized all this amen uh my brother here that brother call his name but we know he might just call him my friend and so forth oh amen yeah the brother knows about you and brother yeah yes brother brother yeah amen so he he said something striking talking about you know Abraham Abraham and the Seed of Abraham okay amen now if you look spiritually you see each and everyone of those Sons they had SE amen meaning the real Believers if it's a messenger let's say it's Abraham the real Believers at that time was the Seed of Abraham so the ministry can be the ministry is of the seed come from the Throne of God and that's why in the Bible the only man who met M was Abraham now some people because of they are trying to separate from God MCC was God but only when he met abah he was when he saves when he saved the people he was Jesus amen amen amen when he took the book he was the am but the same person you know he took the book from the one that set on the throne and then when I read maybe today you will understand it it says he took the book from within himself the book couldn't be somewhere else because it is the Lamb that shed blood and now when we thank God for the seventh angel message he took the book from within himself because the first Throne it is from the one that set on the throne the Bible says so but then the first Throne was in heaven the second Throne was in Jesus the thirone in a man okay amen because God operates from a throne to a throne when he's about to address the people he takes his throne to address not everybody amen amen when American or South African pres stands up to that would be his people his own people being the president of the country that's why you see recently we have been addressed by [Music] King uh here in my book it says when the lamp opens the seventh seal then he he is no longer a mediator mediator amen amen he is a king a king you have seen it amen it is in the book of seals now to us today uh you know he was immediat at the altar for the people but now is no longer immediat no amen okay amen it is in your book here let's to this one [Music] uh come up here it says and I will show you things to come did did it say so yes amen yes because this where were this these things now because or you don't know where were they this things to come where were they in heaven thank you sir Amen to come where to come down right amen then if you look into it those things like we're going through those angels with a capital A angels with a capital A all right am because man is an angel with a small a but angels with a capital that's why it says and uh what happened in heaven when he open all right am why because things that were there the Angels came down that's why from there it speaks about the angels the seventh angel but all flying from Heaven because while heaven was so quiet it's because that were in heaven came down as it says come up here show you things to to come away to come down here all right amen so now and then when he opened now Revelation 21 also he said come and I will show you the Bri the bride the Lamb's wife [Music] am we never at any time we were his girlfriend his wife now before [Music] as I was reading here about the coming weding amen so letters were sent out come I'll show you to come to come where to the they can't go elsewhere no amen come to the Earth but the whole church ages The Chosen uh were prepared because they are part of those things yeah they are part of those things now at appointed time brother God said to this to John come up that's from the church ages I want to announce something to you but come up you must come to the place to receive the announcement amen amen I want to show you things to come to come where to come down and that's why H for this weeks we were just talking about this flying angels flying angels amen amen those were things to come now even the city he made announcement now before we can go to the to land we have already received [Music] invitation we are working according to the invitation is that right amen so now we are going to re this I don't have my rest watch but hoping that the that one is right okay amen now you know the prophet said we have come up here and I will show you things to come meaning that it can't be shown to him from anywhere else there is a [Music] place the things that we are seeing even these days you can't see them any no there must be a place where you can see these things because come up meaning you won't see them in the church because the church that's why he says come out from the seven Church they can be seen they can be seen in the church you remember the prophecies he went where the reason it is west it is because a man was placed East now every time he meets an angel or he's going to meet an angel he will tell you that I was supposed to go west coming from this position man was placed East but every time he tells you I had to go west to meet the Angel's message and to come back again amen amen that's why it's a message from the West receive that from an angel okay amen now we read this for a few minutes let me start by reading also this now remember he says you watch the position he said come up here then I will show you all right amen that means come up from the church ages you can't see it from you can't see it from the church ages did you see how uh today there's so many bread bread bread you find so many churches one breaking from this world they also say the Bride of the bride of Christ say so another one breaks from there he also becomes the bread also all of them are saying the prophet said Prophet said but actually we want to hear from the bride now there's a sister she found me one day I was at a certain family there she said brother you know you two so called message believer you are not one you are P because we were talking and I said my sister take note of this I'm not talking to you about the brides I'm talking about the bride amen now the bride has a brid gr now you must listen to me that when I talk about the bridegroom it's a special news and when I talk about the bride it's something very special uh did you hear here if you want to talk to some you to receive it from [Music] some that's why I said to brother no no this morning his brother the a marriage was announced brother you are blessed because I'll show you something here we must always check whether we are still on the [Music] right amen amen because when he said come up here I'll show you things to come that was to come to brother went West to bring things come back with things to the bride not to the church there's so many things coming to the church separations and all that but from to the Bri she she will only receive letters from the groom you see the difference If the message is not from the groom so it is not to the Bride Can to a church not to the bride for the bride message should come from the groom all right now we will read this quickly here now if you look at another part uh because finally out of the church ages a messenger was called up after the church ages you know God keeps his time with his people after the church ages a messenger was called up things don't that just happen no somebody must beon to receive with the message for the next time now come after the seven Church ages I will show you things to come to come the Bri okay am then again it says come up here and show and it says come up I'll show you the continue with this come up yeah meaning you break forth to a place now a messenger if God says come up meaning that message to come to the place for the message it is like this why there should be some meetings meaning every meeting should be a special be special he takes me from here put me here and takes me from here and put me higher every service should be a special service otherwise we become church goers if you go attend a service you come up you'd have gained something otherwise you are only the message of God it was if they are led by Moses uh they were shifting today they are here that is the real message taking takes you from here and you from otherwise you become the same person a church go is the same person he doesn't change he doesn't go to the service because maybe he has taken a step forward he comes the same way he came last and out the same way amen but the real message was today they are here tomorrow they are here it's moving it's living amen amen amen it's not just a church games all right am that's why I I realized it even this morning now before we close I I realized it that the message it's not stationary so actually the message was not for to create [Music] churches the the message was sent to shape out the bride amen that's right amen amen that's why I can't belong to a church the bride canot belong to a church because she was shaped out of the church you have seven Church ages they speak of time all right amen out of that church they were what they are called Overcomers Overcomers out of each Church AG there some chosen the Overcomers out of this church age there is the Overcomers chosen out amen amen now that's why uh we were chosen to be like the groom let me read you something here let me read you something here uh I believe I've got it here you know I was looking at this because even uh in you know before I come to the church to the Tabernacle I start by reading at home the word amen now let me read you something here about the you know the proph prophet of God this part here he speaks of the brother now that that was months I take I could before the pyramid message was preached M amen where else have you had the pyramid message can we come together and you share to me about the pyramid message right amen uh some brothers were somewhere for certain ongoing now one phone back a brother is here to contact Brother this man who's preaching that man who was preaching I wasn't preaching anything all right amen okay I'm not saying bad things about the people I'm saying what the brother I'm just saying what the brother said am me no I said H not to the brother because the brother is here who has received that message and then but I said to myself I don't don't know whether the brother was going there he went there expecting to hear from God where he went you know so many people they go to church come back complaining that man wasn't talking anything amen amen and uh but tomorrow they go back to the same church just for to complain I used to belong to a denomination where we ended up being two pieces one day I must confess that I also belong to one of the pieces we our group had its own chorus leader and the other group also their own leader now this week Sunday chorus leading is done by our group one of our even the songs you are provocative demons amen amen then next week is there 10 we also attending knowing that we are going to be Target because we also belong to that church amen we just carry on like that shoing at one another the day I so this message of the seventh angel messenger I said I have wondered all the time the word says I will build my church and I've been asking myself where is that church for he said the Lord Jesus Christ I will build my church and the gates of hes shall never Prevail against amen amen and I couldn't put my church there in that position because we were fighting groups in one church are you groups here or can the Bride come in pieces okay it's very serious now uh in line we said come up here I will show you things to come did you know that are you aware that there was a promise of things to come are you aware of that then where are they amen amen have you seen those things to because it's a a m a message amen all right amen now to the to John John since where you are come up out of church ages then I will show you not another church to come but things to come then later he said again come up here and I will show you the briad so all these things to come and the bride he has sent a message that there will be things to come and I'll show you the bride but when he showed him the bride the right was in the form of a city a city because there but you remember the city it's like a pyramid it's in the shape of a pyramid so the Bri should be the shape of the we coming we are coming with that we have something already shown you how the city looks like now we are still coming with that the city shaped like a pyramid the bright shaped like a pyramid all right amen we are coming the Lord willing now before we close here I'm I was looking at something here you look at the time we are living in when H when the prophet in this uh what you call it now is it not a dream what is it yes it's a dream no vision vision a mountain was chopped on top by the prophet according to the vision now before the the pyramid message was pre and he said the one who spoke to brother about the M beneath that was a white stone okay this is uh page 15 of is this the time this the time time to do what now he says beneath when when when that that mountain top was chopped beneath that was White Stone Granite and he says you prophet of God and uh and and you said the son or light has never shine on this before okay amen and I qu here now that light light had never come upon that stone meaning it was never revealed like this stone called to the seventh SE people are saying it's not revealed it's not revealed you will come next year is not revealed you will come here after next year it is not revealed amen amen until when but let us read here then it says light has never come upon that stone it is white but light has never come upon you now the messenger was expecting light upon the stone the color white was not perfection without light amen if you hear the word of God the word of God should be light to you now we have the spoken word everything here but we were waiting for light but before Light Came Upon the message that was preached to us we only scripturally until The Light Came Upon it let me read this a bit now he said look upon this light has never come upon it before you know you've been here maybe worship but has light already come upon what you have believed all this time or you just believe it that the way say so but has it find it its place the place of the way is not in your head am it should be on the throne the soul that's where the message is the message come to the Head amen now because of that that's why we have so many churches but God has got no many churches there has only one but men has many because if it is it comes to that mind then it goes it comes to that mind it becomes theology but the throne talking about The Throne as he says the first Throne was in heaven second in Christ Jesus the3 if it is not from the throne then it is from Men and what's coming from the man has no power it should be from the throne you remember that story of uh what was that princess now Diana Princess Diana we picked up when after the people were talking about about it the reporters then finally there came news saying now this is news from the Insiders the Insiders then when I looked at that I said now this is something else we've been reading who's been coming through television about his head death but now this one says this is now from the inside then I T now wanting to hear from the inside because the outsiders they can only write rumor they have now when I heard of the insid I put aside all the rum newspapers then I now concentrated on the Insiders let me now hear the Insiders you know even in the message you need to hear from the amen everybody's got spoken but you must look for the inside inside meaning now the family the Insiders the real news now coming from the Insiders that's why an outsider will never come with a perfect M because some of the things he says I hear I think they say but inside as it is that's why we should belong you should be the Insiders as an insid you take it from the inside if you say something here and uh if it goes and leaves the original place it will start to change it is no longer as it was amen amen now I thank God today that we are receiving the message from the inside uhhuh amen if you say what of the time inside I will say 12:00 12:00 then you ask an outside what of the time you see as you are asking the people that that time changes from this to that's like the seventh seal it has changed many a Time until they just say it is the seventh SE that's all I read to close and he says here after that it's talking of the pyramid but the inside of the of the pyramid amen because it says never the light has never shine on that white stone in there where was the White Stone okay then he carries on to say now he said look upon this light has never come upon this before it can be the seventh seal you read about it but light has never yet come out upon now one will say it is revealed raled M amen it is revealed okay amen let's read then he says while the people were looking because the people come when all them got up I told them to watch and all of them came up to look in right amen because when if you want to look at the message You' got to look where now they came to look ins inside I read and while they were looking he looked out of the corner of the eye and watch me I slep off to one side and started going towards the w then going towards the West uh the sitting of the sun come up a hill coming up the hill going down the hill getting smaller you get what I mean amen all the people that were watching they saw him getting smaller smaller he said then the Brethren turn around after a while and said did he vanish where did he asking about the prophet the prophet and he said some took that way some took that way some another way but a very few stay and look onto what I had told them that's why no marriage on Sunday he told you tell you he did there's no amen did the prophet didn't he tell us that Sunday is the resurrection all right you see now in the process the message started to de not the message no the the vision of the people okay amen you know if there can be light here or God can send us light and that light will started to grow bigger and bigger and then the people will start to get blinded amen amen even if one if talking about light they'll be saying the of God but not see well you understand what I'm talking about the light has come to lead you you follow the light you get now listen very few they started together looking at that inside White Stone but there was nothing written on it as a result some people looked at it naturally if there's nothing written on you can open your eyes wi but still it won help because there's nothing written on but the others they saw something of which if you come to church one comes and listening and another one is receiving it in hisory that means for the other one it came for him when God comes to you he comes to your heart you know God don't put his way there and say guess no what it means no he doesn't do that like they they did with the seventh SE God never said this is the seven se you people you guess what no if it is the way to the bride it will come straight to their heart amen that's right amen amen if it is to the bride then the wait from the bridegroom comes to the soul amen amen because it doesn't come to the head to a worldly man it will come to the head but to the bride amen can I close right no now now now that that's why even today it is like this we'll still come to pick up some things here even this flying interpretation of that white stone that's why now we're looking at the the Angels here flying [Music] interpretation all right amen I'm talking about the angels with a capital A amen all right let's close with this now it says here it says is this the time looking inside some took that way some took that now but still talking about it but going that way you find him this year saying it is not R you come 10 years after still saying it's not the word of God don't come like that listen some took that way some took that way the reason being they look in and there there was no writing the seven seal there's no writing there amen but it was opened open all right if it is opened something that is closed you don't see then but it was open and when it was opened there was what a white stone a white stone still nothing written if you you listen to the word it said we were in his mind do you believe that you were there now if we were in his mind before the foundation of the world then when he started to create things we were in [Music] him yes that's why he says even the seventh seal was spoken of from Genesis you see amen from the beginning it was spoken the seven seal all right now tell me when is it going to be revealed it is revealed any date it is revealed sorry it is revealed already yeah to you yes [Applause] Amen to some not now those who were H looking looking inside one started to go that way the other one that way the other one that way all coming from that place then it remained like that that's why even today it is just like that amen amen and if it is not open you remain still looking and you see nothing if it is not revealed then you end up leaving the the message we are not talking about leaving a classroom or a chur building no that is not the message if you start off from here say I don't believe what you preach and you walk away you'll end up joining something else but which is not the answer question you still remain without anything and you enjoy to go where it is not preached amen amen but the bride of Christ wants to come to where the the husband amen amen say things that no other woman can [Music] [Applause] understand do you understand that that's why uh we are closing with this that this white stone today I read a very few stay and looked onto what I had told them but the others [Music] left you get what I do did you hear what it said only few remained still looking why this ones remain it is because if you believe the word of God you will believe the word of you get what I mean me the thing being when God speaks to you he speaks to you from the inside thear woman listen closing thear woman she went around saying I know Messiah how did she [Music] know now when all were looking inside other didn't see it but this woman the said I know some know some don't some knew that this Stone inside it's God speaking to us so they State and looked on onto what he says on what I told [Music] amen what they remained with is that he has said look [Music] [Applause] inside so they kept on looking onto what he said they should do look inside blessed are those who are still giving heed to the word that the prophet has spoken amen amen because every man you can give him the word but as the time goes on he will start to paint it change it and so forth but blessed are those who will keep on looking at what the prophet has said meaning they looked on until that was manifested you know a true Christian he believes that if God has spoken that word must be fulfilled so he they that wait upon the Lord shall renew they shall Mount up you see amen and there was no one to say keep looking keep looking that was in them he said I should look in there's something com the Rapture is coming now those for those if if you keep on amen amen you know the the Rapture I'll tell you something the word of God is like this it is not just wait the wa that's why it says they that wait upon the Lord shall their strength renew their strength they shall Mount up Wings amen waiting upon the lord it's a great thing amen now how many know here that the rapt is coming amen um there was a brother he came to our brother G said you know I want to find a job [Music] overseas Now you listen to brother gab he said I wonder this brother I thought he's in the right place but one to work overseas this message then I wonder that was brother we also said we are puzzled there is the type of job yeah he says I want to work overseas there was a brother many years ago he used to come to

to cause problems in the house of Abraham okay but I said he said pray for me brother let us let me close here what happened to this who kept on very few stayed on and look on now you must understand to look on what I had told them stick to the word of the Prophet amen never shift from the word of the Prophet because it it will cause problems to you and the other people once you shift from the word of the prophet stay look inside until it is fulfilled [Applause] amen even right now just keep on looking inside now the difference was the other one is looking inside and the other one is looking inside amen that's right you understand what I mean the prophet says something the other one hear the prophet from the inside and the other one Prophet from the mind that's the difference all right amen now take the word of God it will help you and [Applause] your stick to the word of God it will keep you and your children and your family because if you as a father do something that is not

was quiet and on theile right amen If Heaven is quiet and what is happening because those things that were there he said come I'll show you things to come to come here that's why we talking about angels and the prophet now was not talking about the angels in heaven they came down they were here he talked about the angels heaven has come down amen amen come up here I will show you thing to come to come to the Earth that's why Revelation 21 verse 9 amen and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife right and then and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven
