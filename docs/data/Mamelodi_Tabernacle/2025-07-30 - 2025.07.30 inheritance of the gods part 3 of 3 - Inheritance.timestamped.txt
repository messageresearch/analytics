[0:31] And some people are still standing there
[0:35] listening to the thunders. And he's
[0:36] gone.
[0:42] Amen.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; So he left the place
[0:46] &gt;&gt; coming down through a god of honor
[0:52] time. But you read chapter 5,
[0:54] Revelation,
[0:59] shouting,
[1:01] waiting,
[1:02] singing a new song.
[1:05] Holy, holy, holy. Amen.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; As he was coming down.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15] &gt;&gt; To give it to
[1:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24] &gt;&gt; H
[1:25] the thing is
[1:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He has trouble now here.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35] Now let's look at this.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; I'll start here.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; Watch the title deed of redemption.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; All creation
[1:53] book belong to Adam.
[1:58] Adam had the book.
[2:01] When he fored the
[2:05] it went back to the original owner.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; So God gave Adam the book, the manual
[2:15] book.
[2:18] Every time you buy a car, you get that
[2:20] manual book.
[2:23] When he dropped the book,
[2:26] when he dropped the book,
[2:29] God took it back again.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; And then now he says
[2:37] &gt;&gt; the title deed of redemption of all
[2:39] creation was in his hand.
[2:44] Now he has come to claim it
[2:48] back for the human race.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; Not claim it back to the angels.
[2:57] to the angels,
[2:59] claim it back to the human
[3:03] which it was given
[3:08] to Adam to make sons and daughters of
[3:11] God
[3:14] again.
[3:15] Bring it back to the Garden of Eden
[3:17] again.
[3:20] Everything
[3:22] that I'm reading here now,
[3:24] Amen.
[3:27] That is page 103
[3:31] and
[3:33] &gt;&gt; 111 says
[3:35] talk about jubilee.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; Talk about time when the lamp walked
[3:40] forth
[3:45] and the book sealed in heaven
[3:48] and the prophet says your name being
[3:50] sealed there.
[3:55] Your name is been there on the throne.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says when the seals are
[4:04] opened
[4:06] when the seals the book is revealed
[4:09] you are revealed with the book.
[4:16] Amen.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:20] the books in heaven,
[4:23] &gt;&gt; the mystery
[4:25] and John and the prophet says is my name
[4:27] there
[4:30] on the book of in the book before the
[4:34] foundation of the earth.
[4:38] Now the first thing that represented
[4:40] that redemption
[4:43] was the lamb that had been slain from
[4:46] the foundation of the world.
[4:50] He took the book,
[4:53] opened the book,
[4:55] tore off the seal,
[4:57] and sent it down to the earth
[5:01] &gt;&gt; to his seventh angel.
[5:08] When
[5:13] &gt;&gt; when were the seals open?
[5:19] Right.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:24] &gt;&gt; This happened
[5:26] that time.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Maybe if we don't
[5:34] see this thing here.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; The lamp
[5:40] took the book,
[5:42] &gt;&gt; tore off the sin.
[5:44] We see in Revelation 10,
[5:48] he has the book in his hand
[5:50] coming down and John was about to write.
[5:54] He said, "Don't write
[5:59] for the book belong to the seventh
[6:01] angel.
[6:07] Amen.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; The book belonged to the seventh angel
[6:10] messenger. God bless you.
[6:14] That's why the prophet says,
[6:16] &gt;&gt; we read this thing time and again
[6:20] all the mysteries of God should be made
[6:22] known in that Elijah.
[6:28] So they said to John,
[6:30] "Not right."
[6:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; It's not your ministry.
[6:37] When the seventh angel message
[6:45] page 29, the unveiling of God,
[6:49] all the mysteries of God
[6:52] made known in that
[6:56] in the last hour.
[6:59] This is the last hour.
[7:02] How that Christ is put out of his
[7:04] church.
[7:06] is revealed again as the son of man
[7:08] again.
[7:12] Oh, we can go on and on and on.
[7:16] What did he say?
[7:19] &gt;&gt; Uh when God,
[7:22] let me leave it there a while.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; He opened a book,
[7:29] &gt;&gt; he did that.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:34] If I can say to you, the Lord is going
[7:37] to open the book
[7:40] deceiving you.
[7:42] But the the lamb opened the book.
[7:48] The lamb the lamb opened the book
[7:53] and tore off the seals
[7:56] and sent it down.
[7:59] how he came
[8:01] and brother 26 souls in prison
[8:05] says
[8:07] exactly
[8:10] &gt;&gt; when he set one foot on the sea one on
[8:13] the land
[8:17] the seventh angel messenger was there
[8:25] right amen let me let us drive it a
[8:30] When the Lord Messiah came
[8:34] for was there
[8:40] now this time
[8:43] it's not John's time
[8:46] John's time he came as a in the form of
[8:50] a man a different person from John
[8:55] he introduced him
[8:57] but This time he came in
[9:02] like brother Brenham says
[9:06] the Lord
[9:08] &gt;&gt; took that book
[9:10] out of himself.
[9:17] Amen.
[9:20] So that time
[9:23] &gt;&gt; it was the Messiah coming to Jesus.
[9:27] This time
[9:29] the coming is a different thing.
[9:33] He came to the prophet
[9:37] and the prophet said,
[9:39] "The lamp is standing here
[9:42] to open the seals."
[9:47] But you could not see any number.
[9:53] Amen.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; He revealed the seals
[9:58] through the prophet.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; He brought us the seals.
[10:07] He gave them after opening.
[10:11] He brought them down to the prophet.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Now,
[10:18] &gt;&gt; can we spend 15 minutes?
[10:23] &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; God will help us to keep time.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; Now, that's how he did it.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; We tried it even last time. Now
[10:39] the prophet says Moses and Elijah
[10:44] discovered the sixth seales
[10:49] the six.
[10:52] So the sixth seal and the seven seal
[10:56] Jewish
[10:58] gentile.
[11:00] So the same way it happened with the
[11:02] Jewish people,
[11:05] the same way it happened with the
[11:06] gentile people.
[11:09] Amen.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; H the prophet says
[11:15] &gt;&gt; this Elijah and Moses
[11:17] &gt;&gt; they were that mystery of the six.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; So the seventh seal
[11:27] mystery of the seven se
[11:30] is the prophet.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we are talking of the gods
[11:38] here.
[11:43] He opened the seal
[11:46] and send it to the other side of the
[11:49] contract
[11:53] other side of the contract
[11:55] receive the seal
[11:58] and open the seal to the
[12:04] Now let's read.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:07] All right.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; If if they can miss this,
[12:16] &gt;&gt; it will never repeat.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; You get what I mean?
[12:23] It will never the Lord won't come and
[12:25] open the seals again.
[12:29] If in the world they can miss this,
[12:33] it will never repeat.
[12:36] He came open the seals. Revelation 10.
[12:40] He came down
[12:43] to the David to the
[12:46] angel messenger.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; The the prophet calls it the that book
[12:51] the he says Adam
[12:56] forfeaded the book with the requirements
[12:59] of redemption.
[13:07] Now a redeemed person
[13:13] &gt;&gt; has
[13:16] a book.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Uh
[13:24] you buy a house, you get what?
[13:29] &gt;&gt; You buy a house,
[13:31] &gt;&gt; you get a title deed.
[13:35] Now tit means it's your house.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; You get what I mean? Amen. That's why if
[13:45] you buy through a bond,
[13:48] the bank is the title deed,
[13:52] the house is not yet.
[13:57] So all this time,
[13:59] God had the title deed
[14:02] because we were still going through the
[14:04] payment.
[14:09] Amen.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; But at the end of the payment,
[14:15] hands over.
[14:19] Amen.
[14:23] That means now to claim now.
[14:27] That means now
[14:30] this redemption is yours now.
[14:33] The seals are yours.
[14:36] And here's the book to the seventh angel
[14:40] messenger. Here's the book. And the
[14:43] angel came back and he here is the
[14:47] seals.
[14:49] Because Adam was supposed to open the
[14:56] when he failed
[14:58] to redeem man
[15:01] worthy.
[15:05] No one was worthy.
[15:11] take the book and open the seals and he
[15:14] made men worthy.
[15:23] Do you see what a great time?
[15:27] If only the people could see it.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; I saw seven angels
[15:36] in the form of a pyramid.
[15:40] and picked me up
[15:42] and I was brought east to open the seven
[15:47] says when the seven angels came
[15:52] and made a formed a pyramid
[15:56] &gt;&gt; and he was in the midst
[16:00] in the middle of the pyramid pyramid.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now in the pyramid was a white
[16:08] stone.
[16:10] This white stone was a mystery, a
[16:13] secret.
[16:15] Now we see here the angels
[16:19] coming and brother was looking at one of
[16:22] the angels.
[16:25] He calls that angel the seventh.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Can you see the twin be?
[16:39] Amen.
[16:40] He called that angel.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; The seventh angel
[16:49] &gt;&gt; called that angel the seventh angel.
[16:58] It's in your book in your books.
[17:01] If you have the title
[17:05] so
[17:07] your title deed says
[17:10] the lamp opened the seals is past tense.
[17:16] Then after he open it
[17:19] down with the book now opened
[17:22] the seventh angel messenger
[17:26] it was a sword in his hand
[17:30] and he came from the west
[17:34] came to reveal them to the church now
[17:40] &gt;&gt; they come from heaven
[17:43] &gt;&gt; to the transmitter
[17:47] people
[17:51] from heaven
[17:53] &gt;&gt; to Moses
[17:54] &gt;&gt; to Israel.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; God delivered them.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Moses delivered them.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; God delivered them.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; Moses delivered them.
[18:18] It says Moses was Christ.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for something here.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Moses was
[18:33] page 21. The unveiling of God.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; Moses had the word.
[18:40] After the word was manifested,
[18:44] this was Moses again.
[18:46] But while that word was in him
[18:50] to be given out, he was God
[18:57] because that word is God.
[19:03] Hallelujah.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Page 21, the unveiling of God.
[19:10] As long as the word was in Moses,
[19:14] he was God.
[19:17] He wasn't Moses anymore.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; He had the word of the Lord
[19:23] for that age.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; As long as he had that word,
[19:28] he was God.
[19:31] Nothing could touch him.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; For God, that word is God.
[19:40] That's that's why the people miss God so
[19:43] much.
[19:46] They don't know where he is.
[19:52] The prophet says today
[19:55] in his bride.
[20:00] Amen.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; So much that each and every one of us is
[20:04] a container.
[20:08] The prophet says you can impart life on
[20:10] the others.
[20:15] Amen.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; You can save.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; You can bless.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[20:31] You can say it.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to read you something.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you, dear.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; And that's why he says we are not beings
[20:51] of time.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Now look at this God. Now
[21:01] &gt;&gt; Adam was the God of this.
[21:05] So that means
[21:08] God has to restore that again.
[21:12] He will start first with one man
[21:19] as God was represented in a man
[21:23] says in the at the last day
[21:27] repeat again.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; So, uh, you read page 74 of seals.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for keeping you
[21:44] seals.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; John was given a message.
[21:49] The same time that the Messiah would
[21:52] come,
[21:55] John knew he would see him
[22:00] because he was going to introduce him.
[22:04] A forunner has to wait until he sees him
[22:10] for he can't introduce a spirit to the
[22:12] people
[22:15] him
[22:17] at this time.
[22:19] God introduced himself in the form of a
[22:23] man.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; Elohim came
[22:35] at bread. He ate.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; And we ate bread with brother.
[22:47] But knowing that, knowing that
[22:51] &gt;&gt; behind this skin,
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; because the prophet says,
[22:59] &gt;&gt; "Oh, we can read on and on."
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:05] But he says,
[23:08] "And now the glory of God
[23:12] today is behind your skin."
[23:19] Now that's why it's called the backside
[23:21] ministry
[23:24] from behind the skin to behind the skin.
[23:33] What was on the inside of that skin back
[23:35] there?
[23:38] &gt;&gt; What was behind that skin
[23:41] and the is Israel
[23:44] had to come.
[23:46] The prophet says they knew that behind
[23:48] this
[23:50] he is there.
[23:54] Now book 20 mighty God unveiled before
[23:58] us.
[24:01] God is veiled
[24:04] in his church
[24:09] &gt;&gt; in skin.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; He hid now from from the unbeliever
[24:18] &gt;&gt; and reveal to the believers.
[24:25] God tonight
[24:28] in his church,
[24:30] veiled in his church
[24:33] with a skin on
[24:39] &gt;&gt; still the same God.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Behind the skin.
[24:51] But while they were eating
[24:53] natural food, Adam knew that behind this
[24:57] is Elohim.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; But to the naked eye is a man.
[25:10] Elohim was represented.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; A human form.
[25:17] And that human form
[25:19] was a man in the house of
[25:24] he ate.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Then he did the same thing in the last
[25:28] day
[25:30] behind the skin.
[25:35] Amen.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:47] an uneducated man.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Now remember, he's not just beyond
[25:57] behind every skin you see.
[26:05] As I say, sometimes
[26:08] there'll be a marriage,
[26:10] they will slaughter
[26:12] and hang a skin there.
[26:15] Now, don't think that God is behind that
[26:17] skin.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; But the predestinated
[26:30] as he says something here
[26:33] predestinated
[26:36] when he is behind this
[26:42] because there is a pool,
[26:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[26:50] &gt;&gt; They know when it is not a man.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Behind the skin.
[27:00] That's why he says now talking about
[27:03] angelic beings
[27:06] angelic being associate together.
[27:12] Amen. We we can only meet together from
[27:15] inside.
[27:20] Amen.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; You believe the same thing I believe.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:28] I hope you get it.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; That just dropped right down here.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; You see the word dropped down right
[27:39] there.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; If you've got the Holy Spirit in you,
[27:44] then you are a candidate
[27:47] for association
[27:50] in the unseen world
[27:53] supernatural.
[27:56] No wonder people can't believe in these
[27:58] things.
[28:01] They've never come in contact.
[28:05] They've got nothing in here to be.
[28:09] But when the Holy Spirit comes
[28:12] into the heart
[28:15] of you, quickly you become
[28:18] a twofold being.
[28:22] One of the earth, one of heaven.
[28:26] Amen.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:29] Hallelujah.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; One one body subject to death.
[28:34] But in your soul,
[28:36] your soul has passed from death until
[28:41] amen. Amen. In his body,
[28:44] as a believer, you have an earthly
[28:47] contact.
[28:51] five senses
[28:53] &gt;&gt; but in another
[28:56] it's another contact.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Now if the message I'm preaching is from
[29:04] the soul
[29:07] we can grasp it
[29:12] not from the mind.
[29:16] Let's finish with this.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; The seals were open.
[29:22] Then he took the book
[29:24] back to the angel messenger
[29:28] came and say
[29:31] I was picked up.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:36] Now I will repeat to you that
[29:39] some people think the jackets were
[29:41] flying
[29:45] &gt;&gt; ejected from the earth.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; No.
[29:50] He says
[29:52] &gt;&gt; one of the lights you see
[29:56] will pick you up.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; To pick you up means
[30:05] he will
[30:08] you will become that light.
[30:13] That light is part of is your celestial
[30:16] part.
[30:19] in the rapture.
[30:21] It will be so in a twinkling of an eye
[30:25] that that light will pick you up
[30:28] and automatically you'll just change.
[30:32] Amen. And you'll be in another
[30:35] dimension.
[30:37] Then you can see Abraham and
[30:44] Amen.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; It will pick you up.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; When the prophet was picked up,
[30:52] &gt;&gt; he saw the seven seals
[30:58] &gt;&gt; and all that the Lord revealed to him.
[31:02] When I was brought east,
[31:05] some people think it's a dream or vision
[31:10] thing
[31:13] how he was picked up.
[31:16] God picked up.
[31:19] He became part.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; When these angels were coming.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Now the people say they they've got
[31:36] wings, brother. They've got wings.
[31:42] I don't care whether my theopan has got
[31:44] wings.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; What I know is
[31:48] in the day of the rapture,
[31:51] &gt;&gt; it will come in
[31:55] and
[31:57] I will just fly away.
[32:03] Now if you see it with wings there,
[32:06] &gt;&gt; you know that is the old and the new
[32:08] testament.
[32:12] But today
[32:14] it is the Bible,
[32:19] &gt;&gt; the seven, the New Testament
[32:22] &gt;&gt; and the seven seals,
[32:30] the seventh,
[32:32] &gt;&gt; the New Testament,
[32:35] &gt;&gt; and the seven seals,
[32:38] &gt;&gt; two books.
[32:41] one book. Yes.
[32:43] Two
[32:45] brother is one says it's one but two.
[32:50] Now in those days it was the old and the
[32:52] new testament
[32:56] the day of John but in our day
[33:00] is the new testament
[33:02] and the seven seals.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; So they will cause me to
[33:14] So the New Testament
[33:17] &gt;&gt; seven seals
[33:19] my wings.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; So one day I'm just going to fly out of
[33:26] this
[33:29] New Testament and the seven.
[33:36] Amen.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we need some dynamics
[33:42] to carry us out.
[33:46] I saw seven angels
[33:50] swept down and pick me up.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Now you go and look for it.
[33:59] through theophan you know like the the
[34:02] magis
[34:05] how they were picked up from their place
[34:10] to follow
[34:13] now that doesn't mean so much that they
[34:15] were looking
[34:20] amen
[34:22] they knew where they were going
[34:27] because they were in orbit
[34:32] When that star left,
[34:34] they still continued.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; They still continued
[34:41] &gt;&gt; until they went into the temple.
[34:44] And because they were in the temple,
[34:47] they lost the sight of the star.
[34:51] Then they went out
[34:53] and the star was back again.
[34:56] Amen. to show them the way. The star
[35:00] only showed them which way.
[35:05] It doesn't mean they were going like
[35:06] this.
[35:08] They saw it. He showed them the way.
[35:14] Brother Brenham came
[35:17] as the star of the
[35:20] show as the way
[35:25] and God took him away,
[35:28] &gt;&gt; but we are still on the way.
[35:34] Amen.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:36] We are still on the right track
[35:39] because
[35:42] &gt;&gt; it was programmed in us.
[35:49] Amen.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; And we can say to you
[35:54] didn't mean this.
[35:58] Amen.
[36:02] So what happened?
[36:05] &gt;&gt; God did this
[36:08] &gt;&gt; five minutes
[36:13] the streak
[36:16] seventh man.
[36:20] God through the seventh man
[36:24] &gt;&gt; the gap
[36:29] &gt;&gt; and they still waiting for all the
[36:31] people
[36:34] come in.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the prophet says
[36:42] one man first
[36:46] he will take the position
[36:49] others will come.
[36:53] Now what God did is
[36:56] we won't read now after he left the
[36:59] sanctuary. The prophet says so
[37:05] he left the sanctuary
[37:08] all this time
[37:11] while he was working on that streak
[37:15] as the as the mediator.
[37:21] Amen.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; But when the seals were open
[37:27] when he took the book,
[37:30] he left the sanctuary.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Now one brother says, "You mean the
[37:38] people are are not saved?"
[37:41] No. The prophet I I I don't mean that
[37:46] says
[37:48] &gt;&gt; he took the book
[37:50] now to claim what he redeemed.
[37:55] Now the people that are coming in and we
[37:57] are baptizing
[38:01] claimed
[38:04] that's why they come and say
[38:06] what was this message all this time
[38:11] amen. Amen.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; They are being claimed.
[38:15] God redeemed them before the foundation
[38:20] now. They are still coming.
[38:23] The prophet says their name
[38:28] took the book,
[38:31] a certificate
[38:35] for claiming.
[38:38] Amen. Now
[38:43] &gt;&gt; he has come only with the book
[38:47] to claim
[38:50] no more to redeem
[38:53] redeemed.
[38:55] Now let's go home. Let's go to our homes
[38:59] and go home knowing that
[39:02] the Lord has redeemed.
[39:05] Now he has come to claim.
[39:11] When the seals were opened,
[39:14] some were not even born,
[39:17] but they were redeemed
[39:23] in 1963. Some were not born.
[39:28] We are here. We are here.
[39:32] Is that right?
[39:34] They were already in the book.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; So today
[39:44] some of them they went that way. Some
[39:47] they were drunkards.
[39:49] Amen. Amen. But then a brother will just
[39:52] walk to them and say
[39:57] and they come because they hear their
[40:00] names
[40:03] claiming time
[40:06] to claim.
[40:12] All right. Amen. Now we are associates.
[40:17] Here is here is
[40:20] here. Allow me to close with this. Now,
[40:24] now we can read on and on,
[40:29] &gt;&gt; but this we can manage.
[40:34] Page
[40:35] 83,
[40:38] &gt;&gt; 83.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; We'll read at home.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; We just keep it.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Now, the for fated title, page 86. Yeah.
[40:49] page 86.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; The for title deed is now in the hands
[40:53] of the original owner after the fall.
[41:03] Now I don't believe that if I've got it
[41:05] today
[41:08] say the book is in the hands of
[41:14] that means I don't have it.
[41:18] But now after I have received it,
[41:21] no longer in the hands of the
[41:25] it is in my hands.
[41:31] So I can't repeat and say
[41:34] hands of
[41:37] we say if you don't know what ad
[41:40] adoption is
[41:43] needs to be adopted
[41:46] then you'll keep on saying
[41:49] adoption comes
[41:53] amen
[41:56] if you tell somebody to wait for a bus
[41:59] &gt;&gt; and he doesn't know
[42:04] what a bus looks like.
[42:08] He'll be waiting there with his luggage
[42:10] the whole day. Bus is going to and fro
[42:18] saying the message say I must wait for
[42:21] the bus.
[42:24] the people
[42:27] Jesus is coming and the prophet says he
[42:31] came here they didn't know
[42:35] the only thing you are waiting now
[42:38] is for him to come in his corporal voice
[42:44] we'll meet him in the rapture
[42:47] so we are not waiting for the coming of
[42:49] the Lord
[42:51] actually we are not we were not through
[42:53] with this message
[42:57] the the what and the what? The appearing
[43:00] and the coming.
[43:04] We still need to to look at that subject
[43:10] something.
[43:14] So he says he he's been appearing to us
[43:21] again.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he came.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; But let's leave it there for a while.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Let's leave it there. Amen. Now, page
[43:34] 74. You read it at home again.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Page 74.
[43:40] John was to introduce him.
[43:45] So, he was supposed to see him.
[43:48] The prophet says
[43:51] just like John
[43:53] there's one in this end time.
[44:00] So he says here comes the angel from
[44:02] heaven
[44:05] another one on earth.
[44:08] So they made.
[44:13] Now you know when there is an eclipse
[44:18] people are advised to put on
[44:21] the
[44:27] &gt;&gt; because they will get blinded.
[44:32] Now if God and men meet like this in
[44:35] line
[44:39] people
[44:43] So the people don't see what what's
[44:44] going on.
[44:47] When the the seal was opened, the
[44:49] servants
[44:51] planted the people
[44:54] and in heaven stop their hs.
[44:59] Everything stopped there
[45:03] because now the almighty
[45:07] was now taking another position.
[45:12] Now when the lamp left the place
[45:18] coming down with the book.
[45:21] Eventually,
[45:23] he had to
[45:25] take the messenger away.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; And the messenger said,
[45:33] "Let him
[45:35] increase
[45:38] and let me decrease."
[45:42] Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; He left the sanctuary
[45:48] away the messenger
[45:51] &gt;&gt; and he says
[45:53] &gt;&gt; now only the father.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Who can say amen to that? Amen.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; As long as the street was was open.
[46:12] And the man was not yet restored.
[46:16] What happened?
[46:19] Mediator.
[46:24] Amen. Amen.
[46:27] Now today he left that place
[46:32] and after he left the place
[46:36] he removed the messenger.
[46:42] That means
[46:46] &gt;&gt; no mediator.
[46:49] Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Messenger being removed.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; That is now the father
[47:01] and the subject.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; The father reappears
[47:15] after the messenger.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; The mediator is removed.
[47:23] Then is back to the father
[47:26] and
[47:28] his son. I am his son. Now you are
[47:38] Let's stand up.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Uh we will take the second part next
[47:48] time.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; The gods,
[47:54] the inheritance of the gods.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Let's just close our eyes.
[48:03] going to ask again our pastor here
[48:07] to bless the pastors and so forth.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Shalom. God.
[48:19] Amen.
[48:21] God will give us time to come for the
[48:23] second
[48:26] part of it.
[48:29] Amen.
[48:41] Heat. Heat.
