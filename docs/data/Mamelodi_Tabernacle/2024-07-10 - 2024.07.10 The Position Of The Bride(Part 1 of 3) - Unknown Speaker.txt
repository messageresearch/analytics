TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] God bless you am we greet you again in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ thank God for day of the week all p brothers and sisters so we we have a we have a testimony that God has done us very good here so today we just want to look at the position of the 14 verse John 14 20 l [Music] [Applause] [Music] Revelation 3 vers 14 [Music] 2 for [Applause] [Music] [Music] let's pray heavenly father it's another glorious time to be time said I was glad when they said to me let us goto the house of the Lord [Applause] [Music] our spirit brought us to this [Music] house we pray that the blessing fall upon all that are in the house as we open the Bible again for the reading of the word of God we asking for the blessings and understanding from amen now the prophet says now this day is the reflection of all thees [Music] so the light of all the other ages is in this time so we we have the light of seven Church ages now at this day at that day the the prophet says that is this when this Revelation is made known he said then I will be you shall know that I am in you you shall know so I want to read something again now it speaks of the knowledge we will have for it says we shall know so do you know P 33 [Music] when the prophet preached there on that day he said the Christ in the church is just been made known the Christ be made known the whole thing is the revelation of God so this is the day God has given us the knowledge and if we go back again H just to lay a foundation for some a few [Music] minutes the prophet speaking here he says you know [Music] things Christ in you makes you the complete [Music] reation amen so it's not the fact that you have a revelation [Music] but that is the revelation of Christ the revelation of the son of men not the Son of [Music] God through theeven churches he is the Son of God but at the end of the seven Church ages he is the son of men now the son of man means God is here now before the seven churches he was of to the Jews for three and a half [Music] years he was the son of men not the Son of God as the prophet says he became the son he changed to the Son of God on the day of Pentecost [Music] CH from the son of the Son of God on the day of P now before he died he was not a mediator the Bible says he became a after the [Music] resurrection imator is anbody standing for [Music] you but when he was on they didn't need a mediator because he was with them when he was the son of men he was not because he was here with [Music] them he became a mediator after he left then the Bible says he ascended to the right of the maest but before that when he walked here on Earth he was not a mediator was the son of men so they didn't need a [Music] mediator because they could just speak to him in the book ofis it was and Med need so God just spoke to Adam andam [Music] and did you know that the third PO he says I will am so with the you don't need a [Music] [Music] mediator God was in the Jesus and God today as we are going to read is after he switch down he became us and now at the end he the Christ comes down and Jesus says I'm going back to where I was now where he was he was l so he does [Music] this we the Son of God the Bible says Adam was the son of after the fall God had to come down to close the gap because Adam left again that's why God said where are you says the Lord Jesus came down and sprinkled blood when Adam left the place so the network was broken between men [Music] and the connection was broken so since no one could close the gap he had to come with the sword the word to stand there in the Gap and Di [Music] and so that you could bring men back to the Post became the redeemed [Music] Adam he standing so because you come to the seven Church age then it was a [Music] g so that to bring men with again the pyramid now has no [Music] [Music] Gap chist [Music] the of body all right now the brother speaks again here I want to read this part he says look what was once God's Great secret the great mysterious Secret in his [Music] now put in the hearts of the believer that's why that's why says the people are now getting nothing from because he has come [Music] [Applause] [Music] down for the Bible said to the Jews the god whom you seek the God you are looking for shall come to his temp [Music] they were supposed to meet him in the temple now the thing was temp a [Music] Manus so they went to the temple they missed him because he was in the [Music] human they couldn't get [Music] an because the God who they tried to pray to was in the [Music] [Applause] temp they from them he said I am [Music] he amen you know in the time of Moses Moses said to God when they shall ask me who [Music] is I am [Music] now if you are listening tell them because they said when the people shall say what is the name of this God I [Music] am now I am [Applause] am Ames where he was because before you can worship God you must know where [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] God is not just you [Music] [Applause] find there somewhere in the Bible I think the book of Gans in the book of Galatians chapter 1 verse 21 to 24 [Music] 21 to 244 am [Music] [Music] okay now he says they glorified God in Me yes so they glorify God in Paul 15 Read verse [Music] [Music] amen am now Paul says he revealed Christ in him for him to preach him you know today he revealed Christ to USU to preach not not to his to [Music] hu he in the beginning was the way but when the was manifested it was himu Isaiah prophesy it was a prophecy hallu but when the prophecy was fulfilled then it was [Music] now they no longer preach a prophecy they preach him when he was still coming we preach him we preach the way coming but when he has come we the that he is coming but we preach [Music] him you [Music] know I just want to read John 4u and look at difference verse 39 [Music] 49 just read from 39 to 429 John 4 39-42 for [Music] [Music] [Music] now at first they had the Samaritan [Music] woman they came because of her testimony amen then secondly so when the samarit were come unto himto now him is a man yes now it was no a [Music] testimony because they will come unto [Music] him and many more believed because of his [Music] not of [Music] the 42 and said unto the woman now now we believe not because of your saying for we have him ourselves hallu it's no the all right amen now let's go back to our scripture brother says read of church church is now supposed to be taking the place of Christ that amen four reading here that's the position because Christ himself the prophet says Christ is now in his position in the so is a time to Christ take his position and the bride also taking her [Music] position Christ takes the position as a husband and bride takes POS now if the people believe in Christ then the bright takes the place of Christ makes [Music] and now let me ask a question then where is hallelu okay now what was once great secret that [Music] means you know people are talking about the God who was but today is the god begin [Music] that's why the took the book and came down because the book didn't there it was coming [Music] down what Wasing toist the coming into the [Music] body God gave them laws some laws but God changed the [Music] Covenant and he said this is the New Covenant I'm going to put the LA in them all right now our New Covenant that God has put Christ in us hallelujah [Music] this great Secret in his mind and says Philippians souls in prison he says that mind that was in Christ is your soul [Music] that means God has put his mind in you it's the soul and he says this soul is God's made a place in a man so that when he comes he comes to that place that's why I can that he has come why because he come to he now you can preach him because he came to [Music] you okay that book there's a book it says you know it when Christ comes to he comes when comes to he comes to his [Music] all right now the church is now supposed to be taking the place of Christ caring on his [Music] ministry hallu I read again of a perfect man God dwells in the St of a man [Music]
