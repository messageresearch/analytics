[17:28] it should
[17:32] be the

[18:23] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[18:26] there was silence in heaven about the
[18:29] space of half an
[18:32] hour God bless you let's bow our heads
[18:36] Heavenly Father amen it's so
[18:41] wonderful to come in your
[18:50] presence saying this is the first day of
[18:54] the
[18:57] week as your Prophet taught me that on
[19:02] the first day of the
[19:05] week we go for nothing else Hallelujah
[19:10] but to
[19:13] assemble for that is the day of
[19:19] Resurrection if somebody thinks of doing
[19:22] something on that day he Dishonored
[19:27] God
[19:29] because that is the day
[19:31] of Resurrection
[19:35] amen that's why we were up this early
[19:39] morning
[19:42] amen and uh I just went for the
[19:49] books because it was early in the
[19:52] morning on the Resurrection Day
[19:56] am and early in the the morning yes we
[19:59] think of nothing
[20:01] else so I just went for the
[20:04] books saying Lord speak to
[20:09] us it's so
[20:11] wonderful to spend a day having heard
[20:15] the voice of
[20:17] God let it be the first
[20:20] thing to greet you in the
[20:23] morning so that's why we are glad to
[20:26] come here
[20:29] for to
[20:30] share with the theop of
[20:34] God the word that was
[20:38] there before the foundation of the world

[20:53] us bless our souls
[20:56] amen bless this
[20:58] children that are
[21:01] targeted in our
[21:05] day and even the
[21:08] people who actually are there are
[21:12] responsible for targeting this
[21:22] children we we do not
[21:25] Wonder because the Lord Jesus
[21:29] [Music]
[21:30] himself he was called by some kinds of
[21:35] names just for being
[21:41] holy and we know that it was
[21:46] Satan even Satan today is calling us
[21:53] Bal
[21:55] but we know our God
[22:00] We Shall Serve
[22:02] him no matter what the world
[22:05] say no matter what Satan say we are here
[22:10] to worship
[22:15] Him He said I shall build my
[22:18] church and the gates of Hades shall
[22:22] never
[22:23] Prevail never never over it
[22:29] the
[22:30] gates help us Lord after reading this
[22:34] word you are our spokesman yes sir H
[22:38] even this morning as we pray in Jesus
[22:41] Christ's name amen amen you may be
[22:44] seated God bless
[22:46] you amen
[22:49] amen and when he
[22:52] open the
[22:56] seventh
[22:59] it was silent in
[23:04] heaven now the brother says after this
[23:08] this reading this
[23:11] scripture you must keep
[23:16] quiet amen
[23:20] amen
[23:23] um I'm I've got the very same thing the
[23:27] end of the seventh
[23:35] season you remember last week we read
[23:39] from a future
[23:45] home which is a
[23:47] book uh for the
[23:51] bride talking about the future
[23:54] home and you know the prophet of God T
[23:58] to
[24:00] me that the New
[24:02] Jerusalem is shaped like a
[24:06] pyramid and I said
[24:10] amen then he said the bride of Christ is
[24:15] shaped by like the
[24:21] city and I said Amen to that so now we
[24:27] were reading
[24:31] last
[24:33] uh which it can take us the whole day
[24:37] just reading from this part
[24:40] here where it says where are you
[24:46] going
[24:49] now when you are
[24:51] born you are born for a
[24:56] journey
[24:58] did you know
[25:00] that so that's
[25:03] why
[25:05] uh the prophet of God asked a
[25:09] question where are you
[25:16] going why are you going from
[25:20] here that is the
[25:22] question
[25:24] okay you know uh we are in another
[25:34] generation can search for
[25:38] books then books for back then amen
[25:43] amen then you find there were great men
[25:47] soall great
[25:53] men but if I ask you a question where
[25:58] are
[26:01] they okay
[26:03] amen
[26:06] uh but there was one amongst
[26:11] them the Lord Jesus
[26:15] Christ before this name was given to
[26:20] him I mean here on Earth
[26:26] Jesus uhhuh amen that's why we come this
[26:31] morning no matter what the world
[26:34] says Satan is trying to destroy this
[26:40] church did you know
[26:44] that day and
[26:46] night he is trying to destroy
[26:50] it can you
[26:56] destroy
[26:59] no that's
[27:02] why we we will worship
[27:06] him
[27:08] because we started there is no
[27:14] starting it says for before the
[27:17] foundation of the world he has chosen
[27:23] us not in a
[27:26] church in him
[27:31] now if we were chosen in
[27:33] him surely even this
[27:36] morning we are in
[27:40] here and even billions and billions if
[27:44] they were a billion
[27:47] years still be
[27:51] in plus with
[27:55] himen that's why I can say to
[27:58] Satan you can say what you
[28:02] want Jesus is
[28:07] Lord we shall worship
[28:09] you now I'm looking at
[28:14] this H we were here
[28:17] last week looking at this
[28:21] scriptures because H I have because of
[28:25] the activities morning I have
[28:31] chopped a certain
[28:35] time amen I was supposed to be here what
[28:38] time at this time but I came
[28:43] afterwards all right amen
[28:47] so the seventh
[28:49] seal when it was open
[28:54] open I shall not I shall repeat that not
[29:01] preached no
[29:05] when it was
[29:07] [Music]
[29:08] opened actually no
[29:11] one the only preacher I
[29:16] knew is the one who preached to the
[29:23] theop now the ministry of the
[29:26] theop they didn't start in 19 so and
[29:30] [Music]
[29:32] so it
[29:34] was not yet called a
[29:39] church when it was in
[29:44] him before we were given a
[29:50] form put into this amen natural
[29:56] form which shall pass
[30:00] away this
[30:03] body if it has got no
[30:12] soul it carries the mission of
[30:20] Satan amen amen but
[30:24] if the person that is in that
[30:29] body came from
[30:32] God and it is a
[30:36] theop will come maybe you
[30:39] don't
[30:41] understand
[30:43] the what it
[30:46] is so the seals you know there
[30:54] preaching everybody can take a stage
[31:02] but when we I I come to talk
[31:06] about God and
[31:13] the what you are going to
[31:17] hear is something you have
[31:23] heard
[31:25] and what do have here
[31:30] made
[31:34] you you are
[31:37] what the word of God
[31:42] Isen so the
[31:45] word is
[31:47] preached to the people that are the
[31:53] way because amen
[31:56] means
[31:58] amen so be
[32:00] it that's
[32:02] why I was looking for that
[32:07] moment when we
[32:10] will hear the word of
[32:14] God and we shall not remain with
[32:22] questions because it says I have chosen
[32:26] you
[32:28] before now if you were chosen
[32:31] before that means when the word
[32:35] comes it comes to the
[32:38] people who were chosen
[32:43] before because they have no
[32:46] question that word comes and they are
[32:50] that word now
[32:55] manifested that's right we don't need
[32:57] Bible
[32:59] school we need
[33:04] predestination now I will read few
[33:07] things and that will be
[33:12] it okay amen and you know we are not in
[33:18] competition with another church or
[33:23] churches no the Lord Jesus he was not in
[33:31] competition he was the Lord the
[33:38] Messiah amen The Great I
[33:45] Am yesterday
[33:48] today and
[33:50] forever now if you are his child you
[33:54] become
[33:55] yesterday
[33:57] today and
[33:59] forever you know that's why he says as
[34:02] he has chosen
[34:05] you
[34:08] when before there was the
[34:14] world he has chosen
[34:19] you and it says you are not of the
[34:24] world the world don't know
[34:29] you but it knew him
[34:32] not in order it
[34:35] means for the world to know you it's
[34:38] only if it has
[34:45] known that's
[34:48] why uh we
[34:51] remain what does that say the song
[34:54] victorious
[34:55] victorious
[34:58] the river Euphrates is
[35:03] dry I was showing the children of
[35:07] God they were at my house
[35:10] there and I said hey this morning I've
[35:13] seen
[35:16] something
[35:18] uh I went through the
[35:23] YouTube and looking at the sence
[35:29] the days of
[35:32] Noah in YouTube
[35:36] carries the days
[35:39] of it is
[35:42] [Music]
[35:43] displaying the days of
[35:47] Noah is happening
[35:52] exactly for the Lord says when ask about
[35:55] his coming
[35:58] he said as it
[36:01] was the
[36:04] days and now we see
[36:09] it the days of Noah now if you take the
[36:13] days of
[36:14] Noah then you've got to position
[36:18] Abraham where where were Abraham in the
[36:21] days of
[36:23] no can you realize that Abraham when he
[36:29] looked he saw smoke coming
[36:34] up and brother
[36:38] say
[36:40] church
[36:42] church uh was the
[36:47] same amen
[36:50] amen somebody was listening when I
[36:53] preached last
[36:55] time and I mention uh this uh
[37:05] fly then she
[37:08] also mentioned
[37:11] that
[37:13] that is now talking about flying what
[37:20] El
[37:21] okay but it helps me because one
[37:25] day I will talk about
[37:30] it redeem from the spoken
[37:34] word there things that are
[37:37] happening okay now we looked at it last
[37:41] time that once you hit
[37:46] seven then it says and now where are you
[37:52] going since the
[37:55] seventh since he opened the

[38:43] ministry of the
[38:46] homegoing
[38:48] church the real church
[38:51] today the one that is
[38:55] going

[39:13] Revival amen am we are going
[39:17] back to our
[39:20] home that's all amen everything what you
[39:25] you need
[39:28] it's
[39:29] ahead it's just here around the
[39:33] corner I don't know how many believe the
[39:42] Rapture the rupture at this
[39:48] stage is not something that I can try to
[39:51] teach you because it is something that
[39:54] is
[39:55] already in the
[39:58] people that are going in the
[40:01] RT it's already
[40:05] there all right
[40:08] amen uh when Enoch walked with
[40:14] God he didn't need any
[40:17] teaching a walk with God because it was
[40:23] where in him
[40:27] so you can teach
[40:29] somebody something that is already
[40:35] in because the next if it is in
[40:39] you it is called the
[40:44] manifestation amen amen I don't believe
[40:48] that the people that are going in the
[40:52] Rapture are waiting for the Rapture
[40:55] teaching
[40:57] because he already
[41:01] there in
[41:03] them they are being
[41:07] raptured they are walking like like
[41:12] Elijah who started the journey because
[41:15] the Chariot was
[41:18] coming and he knew that the Chariot is
[41:23] coming what is wonderful about God
[41:27] [Music]
[41:30] Elijah when he started to
[41:33] walk it's after he has seen the coming
[41:39] Chariot and he knew that the
[41:44] Chariot is coming then he started to
[41:47] walk
[41:49] towards the station St he knew where it
[41:54] would
[41:55] come
[41:57] that was Elijah en knew already that the
[42:02] Rapture his Rapture is coming he started
[42:06] to work towards
[42:08] [Music]
[42:10] that amen amen now it was no it was not
[42:14] no longer a
[42:17] preaching but it was a
[42:21] manifestation why are you going
[42:23] Enoch I'm going to be taken
[42:29] Elijah where are you going The Chariot
[42:33] is
[42:37] coming and
[42:40] you I mean
[42:45] the where are you
[42:47] going do you see any
[42:50] future apart from the coming
[42:55] rapture which future are you looking

[47:39] desire you know like we children of God
[47:43] when we read we want to
[47:46] know what are we reading
[47:52] about

[59:58] season to
[1:00:01] manifest the word of
[1:00:04] God as he says for as we were chosen in
[1:00:09] him
[1:00:13] when now you can ask a
[1:00:15] person when did you uh

[1:00:26] amen uh that's just a human
[1:00:31] language but the Bible says before the

[1:00:43] him amen no Ministry is going
[1:00:47] to to put you in him that's
[1:00:52] right because you were
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:00:57] in now we are just talking about the
[1:01:02] restoration the
[1:01:04] manifestation because you were already
[1:01:07] in
[1:01:08] him before there was
[1:01:11] sin before there was church you were in
[1:01:18] him it's a great
[1:01:20] [Music]

[1:02:30] hear gospel a gopel don't steal don't
[1:02:37] goip don't hate you know I think we have
[1:02:41] entered that
[1:02:43] [Music]
[1:02:52] area this you will come and read how the

[1:03:07] day that I should not hate I should not
[1:03:13] steal I should
[1:03:17] not that's you preaching to me
[1:03:21] that but it won't help me
[1:03:25] if I was not chosen in
[1:03:31] him
[1:03:33] before it says
[1:03:35] before the
[1:03:37] foundation of the
[1:03:40] world did you know to say to preach to
[1:03:45] me
[1:03:49] saying thou shall not do this and that
[1:03:52] and that you know it won help me if I
[1:03:56] was not chosen in
[1:03:59] him because this is the time of the
[1:04:03] [Music]

[1:04:30] Christ don't
[1:04:33] steal don't
[1:04:35] hate can that be preached to the
[1:04:40] Bri the bride is the manifestation of
[1:04:43] the word of
[1:04:45] God it is what God has already
[1:04:49] done they were predestinated to be holy
[1:04:56] you see today there are
[1:04:59] people uh to whom Holiness was
[1:05:05] preached Hol still been preached
[1:05:08] Holiness today that is not the bread of
[1:05:13] Christ if you turn around and say thou
[1:05:17] shall not steal thou shall not do this
[1:05:21] that's not to the bride of Christ of
[1:05:24] Christ has done past
[1:05:27] the that's why we are talking about the
[1:05:30] end of the seventh

[1:07:25] all right let me read this
[1:07:31] part
[1:07:34] um he start by
[1:07:36] saying and this is the third
[1:07:40] pool coming
[1:07:44] up then I come to this
[1:07:48] part it
[1:07:52] says uh
[1:07:58] let me find it first you
[1:08:02] notice now for the End of
[1:08:07] Time
[1:08:10] message this
[1:08:12] seal after all she has revealed all six
[1:08:18] seals but he don't say

[1:08:31] SE amen amen he says
[1:08:35] nothing about the end
[1:08:39] time
[1:08:41] see when the time
[1:08:47] ends like we you take seven
[1:08:50] churches you come to the seventh

[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:09:40] preaching it goes with the place the
[1:09:44] people are
[1:09:47] amen the the message
[1:09:52] now
[1:09:55] about the Bri and where the bright is at
[1:10:05] the I'm talking about the spiritual
[1:10:12] position if God when God
[1:10:18] speaks he looks at who he
[1:10:22] is
[1:10:24] because the
[1:10:26] predestinated is in line with
[1:10:32] God that's
[1:10:36] why when John start to
[1:10:38] preach he that which
[1:10:45] we did you know
[1:10:48] brother he doesn't
[1:10:51] say uh what was preached by
[1:10:58] now he
[1:10:59] applies to those who were
[1:11:03] there he says that which
[1:11:12] we we have
[1:11:16] heard and that which we have seen
[1:11:26] even next week if there will be next
[1:11:31] week if perhaps I can get engaged into
[1:11:37] something no I will ask one of the
[1:11:39] brothers
[1:11:41] here to
[1:11:45] preach why because to me he will say
[1:11:49] nothing
[1:11:52] else
[1:11:54] he will only say the thing I was going
[1:11:57] to say now this
[1:12:02] scripture let the scripture be in your
[1:12:04] heart that which
[1:12:08] was from the
[1:12:11] beginning that which we
[1:12:16] have not last week's
[1:12:19] Sunday but that which we have
[1:12:22] heard from when
[1:12:27] in the beginning
[1:12:29] was so we have received the
[1:12:33] word what we bring to you is what that
[1:12:37] which we have
[1:12:39] here amen amen not from the last
[1:12:44] Revival but from the beginning because
[1:12:48] the word was in the
[1:12:52] beginning
[1:12:56] we are not starting a new
[1:12:59] thing okay amen so that's why is that
[1:13:04] which we

[1:20:01] we are coming back to this
[1:20:04] book it
[1:20:06] say let's end
[1:20:08] this
[1:20:10] H about the
[1:20:13] 7th and the end
[1:20:16] time
[1:20:18] SE the seven seal the seventh seal
[1:20:23] closes the
[1:20:24] time of all
[1:20:28] things now when it
[1:20:31] says when it
[1:20:33] starts will be absolutely a total
[1:20:40] secret now some people don't understand
[1:20:44] this thing about the
[1:20:48] secret secret ER between God and some
[1:20:53] other people it actually refers to God
[1:20:57] and other
[1:21:00] people all right amen Gabriel
[1:21:03] came with a
[1:21:06] secret to
[1:21:10] Mary and that
[1:21:15] word that Gabriel brought the prophet of
[1:21:19] God when he looked at it
[1:21:26] and found that that
[1:21:28] word when that word got to
[1:21:34] Mary it
[1:21:37] became yeah that word became blood in
[1:21:40] Mary's
[1:21:45] wom now I will I will come with that
[1:21:49] book next time to show you that
[1:21:55] when you
[1:21:56] say you have received the
[1:21:59] message is that
[1:22:04] word the word that came from God the
[1:22:11] real
[1:22:16] talk it's the word from
[1:22:19] God coming to a dwelling
[1:22:23] Mary was
[1:22:25] chosen as God's
[1:22:29] Vision to bring
[1:22:32] forth God in the
[1:22:36] body now firstly Mary was
[1:22:40] that Mary carried that
[1:22:45] body but that body was the
[1:22:49] word made
[1:22:51] flesh
[1:22:53] amen so the real
[1:22:56] message the real message to us was this
[1:23:03] word that came to us all right amen now
[1:23:08] in
[1:23:15] the now in
[1:23:18] you this time of the end of the seventh
[1:23:24] it's not a body like this
[1:23:28] body this is the
[1:23:32] Earth but
[1:23:35] now the secret
[1:23:37] now we'll read it is that the word that
[1:23:42] you have
[1:23:45] received is that
[1:23:49] body you are going to be
[1:23:51] raptured
[1:23:53] but you must receive a
[1:23:56] body for the
[1:23:58] Rapture you can't be raptured in flesh
[1:24:00] like
[1:24:02] this there must be a
[1:24:05] [Music]
[1:24:08] change because this body shall never be
[1:24:18] raptured one
[1:24:20] head your body
[1:24:23] this body shall never be
[1:24:27] raptured flesh and
[1:24:29] blood can never
[1:24:33] enter the body that will
[1:24:37] be
[1:24:40] repur it's not this
[1:24:44] body did you know that because Flesh and
[1:24:48] Blood shall
[1:24:50] not inherit the kingdom of God
[1:24:55] so says the Bible now are you ready to
[1:24:57] be
[1:25:02] changed do you have a
[1:25:06] body that body that will take you
[1:25:10] up in a twinkling of an
[1:25:13] eye it can be this
[1:25:17] body so the ministry of the seven SE
[1:25:23] is to give you a
[1:25:28] body a body that shall be in a twinkling
[1:25:32] of an
[1:25:33] ey you shall
