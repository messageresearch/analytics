[19:34] Amen.
[19:37] As we greet those that are streaming,
[19:42] may the Lord richly bless them.
[19:46] As we say, touching Jesus
[19:50] is all that really matters.
[19:54] Our brothers will display the prayer
[19:56] request.
[20:02] Jesus

[20:34] to touch him. Just believe.
[20:41] [Music]
[20:44] When you call on his name,
[20:53] touching Jesus
[20:57] is all
[21:01] that matter
[21:03] in your life.
[21:07] and your life
[21:10] will be.
[21:17] There is only
[21:20] There is only
[21:24] one way
[21:27] to touch it. Just believe.
[21:33] Just
[21:36] when you call on his name.
[21:44] Amen.
[21:48] May the Lord richly bless you.
[21:52] Let us raise our hand if you have a
[21:54] desire in your heart
[21:57] to touch Jesus.
[22:00] Amen.

[24:22] you will be healed.
[24:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And you glad to

[26:13] [Music]
[26:24] Amen. Amen.
[26:26] While we are still on the thanksgivings,
[26:30] we received a testimony.
[26:36] We have
[26:39] Mariah.
[26:44] If she can stand,
[26:48] she has a wonderful testimony.
[26:52] May the Lord richly bless you, mama.
[26:56] Amen. Amen.
[27:04] uh her daughter works with the sister.
[27:12] So the
[27:15] daughter brought the matter of her
[27:19] mother to the attention of the pastor.
[27:25] That was last year September
[27:29] September before the wedding of Sister.
[27:39] Yes. Amen.
[27:42] Am I right?
[27:45] No, she was
[27:47] then. Yes.
[27:52] She became after the wedding.
[27:57] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So before
[27:59] that wedding,
[28:04] the daughter brought the matter of her
[28:07] mother to the attention of the pastor.
[28:14] And she was on a wheelchair
[28:20] and there was no hope
[28:24] that she will ever walk again.
[28:29] And the doctors also told her
[28:34] there's nothing we can do.
[28:38] So the pastor commissioned our elder.
[28:47] They visited our mother.
[28:51] They prayed with her
[28:54] and they advised her
[28:57] to stream to stream every service
[29:04] and to believe that the Lord Jesus
[29:07] Christ will heal her
[29:11] and our mother can walk now.
[29:15] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[29:19] She is a living testimony
[29:23] that the Lord Jesus Christ answer our
[29:26] prayers.
[29:30] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[29:34] And she's going to be baptized today.
[29:37] Amen.
[29:43] That's wonderful.
[29:47] and you'd like to have a shepherd.
[29:51] Amen.
[29:55] Just a commission
[30:00] from the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:03] to the pastor to the elder and our
[30:08] mother is here.
[30:10] Amen. Amen.
[30:14] And today we have others that are also

[33:58] being baptized.
[34:00] And that's our sister
[34:03] being baptized.
[34:05] So they are from
[34:09] inang.
[34:15] Oh.
[34:21] Amen. Amen.
[34:30] Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[34:34] Amen. Amen. I have an announcement here
[34:40] and
[34:42] it comes from the community leader
[34:48] [Music]
[34:50] and is a complaint.
[34:52] [Music]
[34:56] It's a complaint
[35:00] about us
[35:05] especially related to the parking of
[35:07] cars.
[35:11] The pastor always say
[35:15] we must love our neighbors.
[35:19] Love the community that is accommodating
[35:22] us.
[35:24] [Music]
[35:25] and respect them.
[35:29] But unfortunately,
[35:32] some are not doing that.
[35:36] They block
[35:38] their gates.
[35:42] Some they park
[35:46] around the bottle store there
[35:50] and they block even the gates.
[35:53] When the delivery truck comes,
[35:58] they have a struggle to deliver
[36:01] because cars are surrounding the area.
[36:07] Some they have exchanged ugly words
[36:15] with the community.
[36:19] It's unfortunate.
[36:24] Last week
[36:26] when they brought the complaint
[36:29] they were so angry
[36:32] they even wanted to close the church.
[36:36] [Music]
[36:37] They wanted to block the gate with a
[36:40] truck
[36:43] saying the members of this church don't
[36:45] respect them.
[36:51] Some even said to one of the community
[36:55] members,
[36:59] I pay for parking,
[37:02] I can park anywhere.
[37:05] Those are the words that the community
[37:07] leaders
[37:09] are telling us.
[37:13] And
[37:15] you know uh they even quoted the
[37:20] scriptures
[37:23] to say
[37:24] believers are supposed to have the Holy
[37:26] Ghost.
[37:30] But these ones that are troubling us,
[37:34] are they members of your church?
[37:38] That is very sad and that is very bad.
[37:46] Can we respect the community?
[37:50] It will not be nice
[37:53] to find the truck blocking the gate
[37:55] after the service.
[38:00] It will not be nice
[38:03] to see them attacking one of our
[38:06] members.
[38:09] It is not going to be nice.
[38:13] Some
[38:14] that were together with the community
[38:16] leader
[38:20] were saying
[38:22] they want to stop this church from
[38:24] operating
[38:28] because of just few members
[38:32] that disrespect them.
[38:36] So we are requesting
[38:41] that we only have two places where we
[38:43] can park.
[38:47] That is inside the church
[38:50] on the pavement outside.
[38:53] If you can't find parking there,
[38:56] there's a ground on the other side.
[39:00] Just park on the ground.
[39:02] We have somebody that will watch the
[39:04] cars.
[39:06] Let us avoid parking along the road.
[39:12] And the other complaint that they
[39:14] brought
[39:16] they say
[39:19] most of the believers
[39:22] they offload while they are in the road
[39:27] blocking the traffic.
[39:30] And again they say when they are leaving
[39:35] They stop around the next to the bottle
[39:38] store.
[39:40] There's a spasa shop there.
[39:42] They leave the car in the road.
[39:45] They going to the spasa shop
[39:48] and that causing traffic delays.
[39:53] Can we avoid doing that
[39:56] with due respect?
[40:00] Can we say amen to that? Amen. If you
[40:03] know you are guilty,
[40:06] come. The elders will pray for you.
[40:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[40:14] If you know you are guilty,
[40:17] come
[40:18] while grace is available.
[40:22] The elders will advise you
[40:25] and will pray for you.
[40:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You know there
[40:30] was a time that the prophet
[40:33] I was praying for someone
[40:36] and when the person came online,
[40:42] the prophet refused to pray for that
[40:44] person.
[40:49] Even the pastor has done that.
[40:52] Even the pastor has done that.
[40:56] Telling a person, I cannot pray for you.
[41:00] go and fix one, two, three.
[41:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So let us fix
[41:05] these things
[41:07] so that we can receive all the
[41:09] blessings.
[41:11] May the Lord richly bless you.
[41:14] Amen. Amen. As we stand on our feet
[41:19] to welcome the word of God.
[41:22] And this morning we are blessed.

[44:48] where we are at the right place
[44:51] where we will hear from above.
[44:57] Amen. Amen. So we want to thank God for
[45:00] everything
[45:02] that he has done unto us.
[45:06] Our pastor is not here this morning

[45:28] to keep the wheel turning.
[45:32] Amen. Amen. So I've got a short message.
[45:37] Yeah. But uh God knows.
[45:42] So before we read the scripture,
[45:46] shall we bow our head and pray?
[45:50] Amen.
[45:52] Gracious and eternal father,
[45:56] our head are bowed down
[46:00] to the earth it came from, but our heart
[46:03] are looking above to thee
[46:06] with our humble heart and desire.
[46:10] We are with great expectation this
[46:13] morning that you should speak to us in a
[46:17] special way. I'm just going to be a
[46:20] vessel. Lord God and the other hand
[46:23] listening to your word as well. You are
[46:26] a good God. You knew the end before the
[46:30] beginning.
[46:32] We are going to read a portion of the
[46:34] scripture and the quote from the prophet
[46:36] and our pastor.
[46:38] So we need your guidance. Lord God, it
[46:41] have everything that is going to be done
[46:43] here should be according to thy will.
[46:45] Amen. Father God, I pray for the entire
[46:48] church. Give them the understanding of
[46:51] the word. Help us to focus in thy word.
[46:56] Lord God, heal all the diseases that may
[46:59] hinder the children of God to see you. I
[47:02] remember the previous couple of funeral
[47:04] I attended,
[47:07] they were cancerous.
[47:09] I remember brother Brennham once upon a
[47:11] time he heard from God when he say when
[47:15] you stay by my word nothing can stand
[47:19] before thee including cancer now I've
[47:23] experienced that the cancer is killing
[47:25] the people today may that disease go
[47:28] back to hell where it belong free the
[47:31] children of God those that are sick this
[47:34] morning can be a cancer can be any
[47:37] chronic condition, the feet that are
[47:41] sore. Heavenly Father, you know better.
[47:44] You have the healing. And the word of
[47:45] God has taught us that when we believe
[47:48] and repent and baptize in the name of
[47:50] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, our
[47:53] sins shall be forgiven. And with your
[47:56] scars in the wound from the cross, all
[47:58] diseases shall be healed. You were never
[48:00] specific, but you said all. We claim the
[48:04] healing this morning Lord God so that
[48:06] everyone should be happy to come to
[48:08] church and listen to the word of God
[48:10] because there was a time when the
[48:12] prophet says the time shall be no more.
[48:15] Now this morning we are not saying that
[48:17] but we say the time is no more. We are
[48:20] right on the verge of rapture. Lord God
[48:23] help us always to align oursel with the
[48:26] word to straighten up our ways so that
[48:29] we may please thee Lord God. We want to
[48:31] thank you Lord God as you are going to
[48:34] read the portion of the scripture. Bless
[48:36] the Bible. Bless the listeners this
[48:38] morning. Bless all that are streaming
[48:40] this morning for you know better Lord
[48:43] God. We appreciate and we put everything
[48:45] unto your capable hand in the mighty
[48:47] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[48:49] Christ. Amen. Amen.
[48:54] Amen.
[48:55] Let's read from the book of Ezekiel
[48:58] chapter 38 verse 1 to5.
[49:03] Ezekiel 38 verse 1-5.
[49:10] And the word of the Lord came unto me,
[49:12] saying, Son of man, set thy face against
[49:16] Gog, the land of Mog, the chief prince
[49:20] of Mach and Tuba, and prophesy against
[49:23] him, and say, Thus said the Lord God,
[49:27] behold, I'm against thee, O Gog, the
[49:30] chief prince of Mach and Tuba, and I
[49:33] will turn thee back and put hooks into
[49:36] thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth
[49:40] All and all thine army, horses and
[49:43] horsemen, all of them clothed with all
[49:45] sort of armor.
[49:48] Even a great company with backlass and
[49:51] shields. All of them handling swords.
[49:55] Persia, Ethopia, and Libya with them.
[49:58] All of them with shields and helmet.
[50:00] Amen. You may be seated.
[50:08] We will come to this scripture
[50:11] but let's read revelation chapter 13
[50:17] only verse 11
[50:24] revelation 13 11
[50:27] and I beheld another beast coming up out
[50:29] of the earth and he had two horns
[50:33] like a lamb and he spake as a dragon.
[50:36] Amen. Amen. God richly bless you.
[50:40] I'm going to talk about this morning
[50:44] the simultaneous appearance of our Lord
[50:48] Jesus Christ.
[50:53] Amen. Amen.
[50:56] Uh we are looking at what is happening
[50:59] today.
[51:02] When we look at those things,
[51:05] we check in the Bible
[51:07] and in the spoken word
[51:10] because nothing has just happened.
[51:15] God knows everything.
[51:18] He's part of that things.
[51:21] He saw and they should happen.
[51:25] Be not deceived.
[51:28] Just relax in the word of God.
[51:32] Is God doing everything?
[51:36] Sometimes
[51:38] as human being we normally say let's try
[51:43] harder.
[51:45] But if you try harder but God said no,
[51:50] God said no.
[51:52] It's not about
[51:54] your effort.
[51:56] It's about what God has planned for you.
[52:00] Those that will go to heaven, they will
[52:03] go to heaven irrespective of the
[52:05] condition.
[52:07] Those that are born for damnation,
[52:11] they will go for damnation. There's
[52:13] nothing you can do, a complete job
[52:18] was done.
[52:20] Sometimes as human being, we may think
[52:23] we can do things this way.
[52:27] But God has his own way.
[52:31] I'm going to read the scripture where
[52:34] God says, "I
[52:37] you know God doing it."
[52:40] Amen. Amen. I remember in the book of
[52:43] Exodus,
[52:45] God said to Moses,
[52:47] I God will harden the heart of
[52:53] Is God doing that? So you can stand
[52:56] there and try to fast for
[53:02] him. But God said, "I will harden his
[53:06] heart
[53:07] and I will take my children out
[53:11] and I will bless them. I will give them
[53:14] what they need." God saying I will
[53:20] even today what is happening. God said
[53:23] so.
[53:25] Well, we read two scriptures here. I
[53:28] just want to go straight to
[53:32] this scripture here. It speaks about
[53:37] the land of Mog, the chief prince of
[53:41] Mach and Tub.
[53:43] It's right there in the Old Testament.
[53:48] More than 2,500 years ago,
[53:53] Jesus was born.
[53:55] This was prophesied by Ezekiel.
[53:59] Amen. Amen. Now because we are living in
[54:01] the time of politics
[54:04] that the name change
[54:06] from this name
[54:08] that name us as children of God, we can
[54:12] be able to trace back.
[54:15] We have the prophet.
[54:17] If there's another generation,
[54:20] I don't know if there's another
[54:22] generation,
[54:24] they will be surprised that one time.
[54:32] Do you understand? But when you speak
[54:35] about
[54:39] Amen. So now here the Bible speaks about
[54:43] Gog and Me
[54:45] and the Bible speak about me and Tuba.
[54:50] Those names were in the Old Testament.
[54:52] But where are those names now? Who are
[54:55] these people? Who are this land?
[54:59] The earth has never changed. It remain
[55:03] the earth. But we changed.
[55:06] Amen. Amen. Limpopo used to be
[55:11] those kind of things they changed
[55:13] because of politicians
[55:15] pushing whatever agenda they want.
[55:19] And I want to tell you this morning that
[55:22] when the Bible speaks about Mishak and
[55:24] Tuka,
[55:26] I'm listening to the prophet and looking
[55:28] at the historians
[55:31] living in the area
[55:34] tell you that Mishach and Tub
[55:37] speaks about Russia
[55:39] and China.
[55:42] The prophet said it as well. Amen. Amen.
[55:46] So now what is happening in Mach and
[55:51] Tuba
[55:53] meaning Russia Russia. Amen. Amen. So
[55:57] there were wars
[56:00] and even now as I speak
[56:03] there is war the war against Israel
[56:08] and Iran.
[56:10] Amen. Amen.
[56:12] Now Iran is Persia.
[56:17] You remember in the olden days
[56:21] we had Me and Pesia
[56:24] that invaded Babylon.
[56:28] It's the very same thing today.
[56:30] We have Iran and is those patients
[56:35] those people that the Bible speaks about
[56:38] more than 2,500.
[56:43] Amen. Amen. But those people of the old
[56:46] they are old.
[56:49] They are dead. Now it's new people. But
[56:52] the same spirit
[56:55] the spirit continue.
[56:57] That is why in the church we operate
[57:02] under same spirit
[57:04] of Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:06] The spirit that started with Ephesians
[57:12] and
[57:14] is the same spirit is the same Christ.
[57:18] You can kill the body
[57:20] the spirit but the soul is of God
[57:25] remain intact.
[57:28] What I'm trying to tell you again,
[57:31] the Bible speaks about Israel and this
[57:35] Mishk is
[57:38] is Russia.
[57:41] Well, I was following this warm
[57:44] what is happening globally.
[57:47] I said no.
[57:50] When America is speaking before I go
[57:53] there, we read Revelation 13 11
[58:00] the Bible just speaks about that and the
[58:03] prophet will explain what is that
[58:07] scripture revelation 131
[58:11] is America.
[58:13] So here we speak about Russia and
[58:16] America
[58:18] and Israel is right in the midst of
[58:22] we can have wars but once you touch
[58:27] anointed one it bring God's attention.
[58:35] Russia is fighting Ukraine.
[58:38] It's okay. Amen. Amen. If if if Donald
[58:41] Trump Donald Trump is complaining about
[58:47] it's okay if America is complaining
[58:51] about South Africa.
[58:53] It's okay. If America can say
[58:57] is a nonexisting country
[59:01] but the day we speak about Israel
[59:05] touch God.
[59:08] Amen. Amen. For the Bible says Israel is
[59:13] our timeline.
[59:16] If
[59:17] if you want to know where we are,
[59:21] don't look anywhere. Don't look at
[59:24] America or Africa but look at Israel.
[59:28] You will understand where we are. Why
[59:32] there's a war now?
[59:34] Israel. Israel. Amen. Amen. We will look
[59:37] at the spoken worden.
[59:39] Amen. Amen. I'm going to read from the
[59:41] question and answers
[59:43] question and answers. Question and
[59:45] answers was when people asking question
[59:48] to brother
[59:52] they ask the church age.
[59:56] The church age
[59:59] ending had blackout and has blackout.
[1:00:04] The bride is called
[1:00:06] We have already entered into the
[1:00:08] tribulation period.
[1:00:13] Brother answer, he said, "No, no, no."
[1:00:17] Amen. Amen. I wish that I could just
[1:00:20] have more time on that.
[1:00:24] The bride when she has taken from the
[1:00:27] church.
[1:00:29] Remember why why brother is saying that
[1:00:32] the bride taken from the church.
[1:00:37] The bride is being taken from the
[1:00:41] churches
[1:00:43] like Israel
[1:00:45] is taken from other nations.
[1:00:48] for only two things that draw the
[1:00:52] attention of God
[1:00:54] is Israel and Abraham.
[1:00:58] Amen. Then the church age will seize.
[1:01:03] The church age will come to an end
[1:01:07] goes into chaos.
[1:01:09] The bride goes to the glory
[1:01:13] and the tribulation period set in
[1:01:17] upon the sleeping vision.
[1:01:21] Three and a half years.
[1:01:24] Israel is getting its prophets.
[1:01:28] Revelation 11.
[1:01:31] Then tribulation
[1:01:33] sets in upon Israel. And then comes the
[1:01:39] battle of Armageddon
[1:01:41] which destroyed
[1:01:44] all things
[1:01:46] and then the bride returned back with
[1:01:50] the groom for a thousand years.
[1:01:54] I don't want to go there. I want to
[1:01:56] focus
[1:01:58] only on the three and a half years
[1:02:02] and that's all the white judgment
[1:02:07] millennia the new city not now I want to
[1:02:12] focus presently of one
[1:02:18] let's read chapter 39 of Ezekiel 39
[1:02:22] we'll start with verse one going Now
[1:02:27] I just want to show you what is
[1:02:29] happening today
[1:02:32] as per the scriptures as per the codes
[1:02:35] because this day this scripture is
[1:02:39] fulfilled.
[1:02:41] Amen. Amen. Ezekiel 39. Yes. From verse
[1:02:44] one.
[1:02:47] Therefore thou son of man prophesy
[1:02:49] against Gawk and say thus say the Lord
[1:02:52] God. Behold, I am against thee, oh Gog,
[1:02:55] the chief prince of Mach and Tuba. And I
[1:02:58] will turn thee back and leave but six
[1:03:01] part of thee, and will cause thee to
[1:03:03] come up from the north parts, and will
[1:03:06] bring thee upon the mountains of Israel.
[1:03:09] Amen. Amen.
[1:03:11] You see where I say God say, I will. Is
[1:03:18] God doing this? There's nothing that you
[1:03:22] can do in this world
[1:03:26] do it. He said, I will turn thee back
[1:03:30] and leave, but the sixth part of thee
[1:03:35] will cause thee
[1:03:38] to come up from the north part and will
[1:03:43] bring thee upon the mountain.
[1:03:47] Is God doing this?
[1:03:50] God, he make Russia
[1:03:54] to leave north part and I come to the
[1:03:57] mountain of Israel. For brother Brenham
[1:04:02] says the king of the north is Russia. He
[1:04:06] even say I said it several times that
[1:04:10] watch Russia
[1:04:12] king of the north. When you are a child
[1:04:14] of God you don't live just a careless
[1:04:17] life. You look at Russia. You look at
[1:04:22] Israel because something needs to happen
[1:04:26] in the mountain of
[1:04:28] because the king of Mog and Me from the
[1:04:34] north being Russia
[1:04:37] will come in the mountain of Israel.
[1:04:41] You know when war start
[1:04:44] it starts so light.
[1:04:47] I just mentioned few
[1:04:50] and then if if if I want to start war
[1:04:52] with you
[1:04:54] I will check amongst you
[1:04:58] who can stand on my side
[1:05:00] then if you realize I'm fighting you
[1:05:05] start check
[1:05:08] on your side
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:14] amen you know When Russia
[1:05:18] was invading Ukraine,
[1:05:21] it was for one reason.
[1:05:24] When they hit Russia, Ukraine when they
[1:05:28] hit Russia
[1:05:30] in the Second World War,
[1:05:33] Ukraine was the base.
[1:05:36] Then this time, Russia said no more. you
[1:05:41] allow NATO
[1:05:43] in your land
[1:05:45] deal with you harshly
[1:05:48] because the the the enemy should find a
[1:05:52] place nearby to invade you. You remember
[1:05:59] America wanted to invade Zimbabwe
[1:06:03] and they wanted a base
[1:06:08] is next to Zimbabwe.
[1:06:11] That's what they do. Amen. Amen. Now,
[1:06:16] Iran being the Pesia
[1:06:19] is not going along with Israel,
[1:06:23] but there we see Russia wanting to pass
[1:06:27] through Persia
[1:06:29] wanting to pass through the river
[1:06:33] because it's right there
[1:06:36] to go to Israel so that they can invade
[1:06:39] them.
[1:06:40] But God said, "I allowed it.
[1:06:44] When I allow Russia to go to Israel,
[1:06:49] invade my people,
[1:06:51] they will never go back home."
[1:06:56] Amen. Amen. I was listening to
[1:07:01] they interviewed him. He he always quote
[1:07:04] the scripture.
[1:07:06] I was listening to Donald Trump when
[1:07:09] they interview him. He quote the
[1:07:11] scripture.
[1:07:13] Amen. Amen. They know the time we are
[1:07:16] living in. They know is the end of the
[1:07:20] world.
[1:07:22] Donald Trump was keeping on saying
[1:07:26] you are playing with fire. You take us
[1:07:29] to the world war.
[1:07:32] The third world war.
[1:07:35] But they can't control it. God say, "I
[1:07:40] will do that."
[1:07:42] Is God doing that?
[1:07:45] Amen. Amen. When we read Revelation
[1:07:48] 13:1,
[1:07:52] this one, this beast from the earth will
[1:07:56] come like a lamb
[1:07:59] but speak
[1:08:01] like a dragon. When Donald Trump is
[1:08:04] going anywhere, he say I come with
[1:08:06] peace.
[1:08:08] When he leave the place,
[1:08:11] lot of cops on the floor.
[1:08:14] America
[1:08:15] went to Iraq.
[1:08:17] You know, but they couldn't stand even
[1:08:20] today.
[1:08:23] America went to Libya. They couldn't
[1:08:26] stand today
[1:08:29] in the name of peace.
[1:08:32] Amen. Amen. When you Israel, start to
[1:08:37] invade Iran,
[1:08:39] they asked Donald Trump, "What are you
[1:08:41] saying?" I said, "Now I come with peace.
[1:08:44] I'm just I'm not going to kill anyone. I
[1:08:48] just need to negotiate."
[1:08:50] But guess what? They just bomb Iran
[1:08:52] again. And who are they? America.
[1:08:57] The men of peace. A lamp.
[1:09:01] Speak like amen.
[1:09:04] Amen. Now let's read
[1:09:09] here says God being misunderstood.
[1:09:15] Amen. Amen. They they ask him a question
[1:09:18] again. So it's question and answers.
[1:09:22] Will Ezekiel 38 and39 come to pass
[1:09:25] before the rapture 389?
[1:09:30] Brother Abraham said Ezekiel 38 and 39
[1:09:34] deal with Gog and M
[1:09:36] which is Russia
[1:09:39] the north country
[1:09:42] and God deals with Gog and
[1:09:46] when they come down before Israel
[1:09:50] and I think that
[1:09:53] after the rapture.
[1:09:55] This is what I want to show you.
[1:09:58] Within three and a half years.
[1:10:03] Amen. Amen. This is what will happen.
[1:10:06] The rapture will take place.
[1:10:10] When the rapture takes place,
[1:10:12] we will be in the air
[1:10:15] at the wedding supp
[1:10:18] with our Lord Jesus Christ. At the same
[1:10:22] time,
[1:10:23] in that three and a half years, there
[1:10:26] will be tribulation.
[1:10:29] At the same time within 3 and 1/2 years,
[1:10:34] Revelation chapter 11,
[1:10:37] Moses and Elijah will be in Israel.
[1:10:42] Israel will be invaded
[1:10:45] by Russia. But God said, I will deal
[1:10:50] with the king.
[1:10:53] Amen. Amen. So I was looking and
[1:10:58] realized that
[1:11:00] China has got a lot of troops,
[1:11:04] more than 2 million soldiers
[1:11:08] and is the largest army in the world.
[1:11:12] America
[1:11:14] does not even go close.
[1:11:18] But it's not about the big
[1:11:22] because Russia has got two troops as
[1:11:26] well, not large as America. But brother
[1:11:30] Brennham says Russia is the tool to the
[1:11:35] head of
[1:11:37] it's not about how big you are.
[1:11:40] Go and look at the map of Iran.
[1:11:44] Look at the map of Israel.
[1:11:47] Israel goes four times in Iran.
[1:11:52] Israel challenge Iran.
[1:11:56] It's not about how many troops.
[1:11:59] It's about what God said.
[1:12:03] God allowed
[1:12:06] to provoke Iran because there's no more
[1:12:10] time when when when Israel got to attack
[1:12:14] Iran, Russia stood up.
[1:12:19] When Russia stood up, America says, "We
[1:12:23] cannot touch the anointed nation of
[1:12:26] God."
[1:12:27] Now we see re revelation 13 and 38
[1:12:33] coming into action.
[1:12:36] Hallelujah. Amen. We don't worry much
[1:12:39] about India.
[1:12:41] The largest
[1:12:43] troops
[1:12:45] after China.
[1:12:47] You understand? Amen. The first is
[1:12:49] China. The second is India. Do you
[1:12:52] understand? Amen. and then America and
[1:12:55] then Russia, North Korea and then they
[1:12:58] have all those armies.
[1:13:01] What is happening is leading us to the
[1:13:05] third world war
[1:13:08] is everything
[1:13:10] is leading us to the war of Armageddon.
[1:13:14] The war of Armageddon is God himself
[1:13:18] sweeping the whole world.
[1:13:22] Amen. Amen. The missiles
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:26] that they have will kill all of them.
[1:13:33] The war of Armageddon,
[1:13:35] there's no winner
[1:13:37] because it wiped up everything.
[1:13:42] But the second world war,
[1:13:45] Germany was up there.
[1:13:48] But Russia invaded the German
[1:13:52] and Hitler was killed.
[1:13:55] Brother when he talk about Hitler,
[1:13:58] he said he will die a mysterious death.
[1:14:04] Amen. Now the people tried to hide this
[1:14:06] and that.
[1:14:08] Say this and this. He shot himself in
[1:14:12] the in the banker.
[1:14:15] He ran away to another foreign land.
[1:14:17] Because the prophet says his death will
[1:14:20] be mystery but at the end of the war
[1:14:25] was the one took the cup.
[1:14:31] Brother Brennham says I said there is
[1:14:36] three isms
[1:14:38] trying to take a hold of the world today
[1:14:43] is fascism is nazism is communism and
[1:14:48] what I say they would all went up
[1:14:53] communism
[1:14:56] communism is Russia
[1:14:59] China can act
[1:15:01] only if Russia say help me. Those are
[1:15:05] communist country.
[1:15:09] Amen. Amen. So now America
[1:15:13] will check who stand on their side.
[1:15:18] Russia will check who stand on their
[1:15:21] side.
[1:15:22] Those two forces
[1:15:25] they will come to finish the entire
[1:15:27] world.
[1:15:29] Now as I talk Russia and America are
[1:15:34] like this
[1:15:36] they are fighting now they haven't start
[1:15:40] physically they are talking but Israel
[1:15:44] as small as it is provoked Iran that is
[1:15:48] supported by Russia
[1:15:51] at the beginning.
[1:15:54] Now I just heard you all to repeat over
[1:15:59] [Music]
[1:16:00] Keep your eyes
[1:16:02] on Russia. You remember that? Keep your
[1:16:06] eyes on Russia. She'll all wind up in
[1:16:11] communism
[1:16:13] and then it will all wind up finally in
[1:16:16] Catholism.
[1:16:18] Remember, remember it will all wind up
[1:16:23] communism
[1:16:25] and not exactly right.
[1:16:28] That's the battle of Amageddon
[1:16:30] right over here when Christ comes.
[1:16:36] Amen. Amen. The World Council of
[1:16:39] Churches
[1:16:42] are built in America but by the Romanism
[1:16:48] The Roman Romanism
[1:16:51] is the one that had the word cut of
[1:16:53] churches
[1:16:55] being the greatest
[1:16:57] in the sea.
[1:17:00] It had power
[1:17:03] to give to the
[1:17:05] power of in America
[1:17:08] to have welcome of churches
[1:17:12] will be the beast
[1:17:14] of the earth
[1:17:16] beast out of the earth is like a lamb.
[1:17:23] Amen. Amen. Now the Russian
[1:17:28] is there
[1:17:29] to shoot catalism
[1:17:33] America
[1:17:35] but they will be killed or wiped off by
[1:17:39] God himself.
[1:17:43] Amen. Amen. So God, you know, when I was
[1:17:47] following this war,
[1:17:49] I was listening to the rabbis,
[1:17:53] [Music]
[1:17:55] those that are in Jerusalem
[1:17:57] at the moment the city of Jerusalem
[1:18:02] safe,
[1:18:03] but they are hitting
[1:18:06] Tel Aiv, part of Israel, one of the big
[1:18:09] city in
[1:18:12] they are hitting there.
[1:18:14] So Israelis,
[1:18:16] they all over the world.
[1:18:19] Amen. Amen. I was checking once more
[1:18:23] how did they killed
[1:18:25] the commanders
[1:18:28] and the scientists
[1:18:31] of Iran.
[1:18:34] They prepare that evening and I was
[1:18:38] listening to one of the rabbi.
[1:18:41] He said, "We prepared this started to
[1:18:45] 2024
[1:18:47] in September
[1:18:49] and they started to trace.
[1:18:51] But when someone want to assassinate
[1:18:54] you,
[1:18:56] it's so easy
[1:18:59] to plan.
[1:19:01] Amen. Amen. You leave your home
[1:19:04] at this time. You put full
[1:19:08] total. You get to work.
[1:19:12] You eat your breakfast and lunch.
[1:19:17] You love to be with they traced them.
[1:19:20] The Israelis
[1:19:22] traced them. That evening one time at
[1:19:27] the same time eliminated them.
[1:19:32] Amen. Amen. Because Iran is the patient
[1:19:36] and history tells us how the Iranians
[1:19:41] lived with the Israel. So the Israel
[1:19:44] know everything about.
[1:19:47] Amen. Amen. Now Iran
[1:19:51] you know hit back to Israel.
[1:19:54] When it hit back at Israel,
[1:19:56] America said, "No, you have touched
[1:20:01] untouchable.
[1:20:02] We need to act." When they want to act,
[1:20:06] Russia said, "No,
[1:20:08] we touch we act." What is that?
[1:20:13] Amen. It's the end of everything.
[1:20:24] Amen. Amen. The first seal,
[1:20:28] brother Brennham says, "What did
[1:20:30] communism raise up over here in Russia?
[1:20:37] It just make me sick in my stomach
[1:20:42] to hear so many preachers about
[1:20:44] communism
[1:20:47] and they don't even know what they're
[1:20:49] crying about.
[1:20:51] That's right. Amen. Communism ain't
[1:20:54] nothing.
[1:20:56] It's a tool in the hand of God to bring
[1:21:00] revenge
[1:21:02] upon the earth for the blood. of the
[1:21:05] saints.
[1:21:08] That's right. Amen. Amen. Amen. When you
[1:21:11] trace the life of Israel as a nation
[1:21:16] because Israel is a nation elected by
[1:21:20] God.
[1:21:21] Amen. Amen. He will take them to Egypt.
[1:21:26] Egypt is here in Africa.
[1:21:29] He will bring them to Africa.
[1:21:32] And at the right time, he will take them
[1:21:35] back to their promised land. And when he
[1:21:39] take them back, Egypt wanted them to be
[1:21:42] behind.
[1:21:44] God himself, he said, I will punish
[1:21:48] Pharaoh.
[1:21:50] It's God who's doing that. Amen. You may
[1:21:53] feel pity for them, but that is the plan
[1:21:56] of God.
[1:21:58] And when they go back,
[1:22:01] casual is behind
[1:22:05] that time. Israel did not have the
[1:22:09] troops.
[1:22:12] Amen. Amen. The only man who saw this
[1:22:15] world fail
[1:22:17] was Moses, but God took him to the
[1:22:21] desert for 40 years
[1:22:24] drained that thing up.
[1:22:27] God always wanted to show
[1:22:30] people that he is the one fighting the
[1:22:33] battle not our intelligence.
[1:22:37] You can have the strongest intelligence
[1:22:40] but when God hit me really hit hard
[1:22:46] when they crossed the Red Sea the whole
[1:22:49] troops of the Egyptian
[1:22:53] you know they all died in the sea.
[1:22:57] Israel. Israel without the troops.
[1:23:01] Amen. Amen. Then he allowed
[1:23:03] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:23:05] baby to capture them because they sinned
[1:23:10] against him.
[1:23:12] But when God hit Babylon
[1:23:16] is so hard.
[1:23:18] Amen. Amen. Now today as we are living
[1:23:21] here, the Bible speaks about Gog and
[1:23:24] Mag.
[1:23:25] It speaks about Russia. Russia having
[1:23:28] the highest intelligence.
[1:23:32] For Israel to hit them,
[1:23:36] we need not to have the intelligence.
[1:23:39] God himself
[1:23:42] sends.
[1:23:49] This is what we are living for today.
[1:23:53] Even this morning there's a lot going
[1:23:57] we thank God because we have the Bible
[1:24:01] scriptures we have the spoken word we
[1:24:04] can read and refer
[1:24:10] one day Donald Trump said to Britain
[1:24:16] can you stand against Russia
[1:24:19] alone I saw the president of Britain
[1:24:22] prime minister prime minister
[1:24:24] stubbing
[1:24:26] because he know he can't stand Russia.
[1:24:32] Amen. Amen. Because
[1:24:35] Russia or the communism was just born
[1:24:40] to be the tool in the hand.
[1:24:44] That's all. You can do whatever. Even
[1:24:48] when Trump think of Russia, you think
[1:24:52] twice.
[1:24:55] The king thought handwriting on the on
[1:24:57] the wall handwriting on the wall spoken.
[1:24:59] The king thought
[1:25:01] he was safely secure
[1:25:05] was king you know of Babylon
[1:25:09] but he didn't know
[1:25:11] all the time godless nation
[1:25:16] like Russia. Now remember the prophet
[1:25:19] was not in Med Persia.
[1:25:23] The prophet Daniel was in Babylon.
[1:25:28] The big rock and the roll
[1:25:31] was going on in Babylon
[1:25:33] where the revival was going on to
[1:25:37] where the prophet was was and the
[1:25:39] message was
[1:25:42] all time. minutes and the patient
[1:25:46] are just as godless
[1:25:50] and heartless
[1:25:52] as Russia
[1:25:54] had found a way. They had some
[1:25:58] scientists too
[1:26:01] and they had bypassed river Ephro
[1:26:07] that's why the river I was even reading
[1:26:10] about it yesterday is drying drying
[1:26:14] so that this king from the north
[1:26:19] can use the very same
[1:26:22] Israel.
[1:26:24] Amen. Amen. For them to pass through,
[1:26:28] they have to have agreement
[1:26:31] with the Iranians.
[1:26:35] Well, I was checking here.
[1:26:38] They say an ancient country called
[1:26:42] Mesopotamia
[1:26:45] was between Tris and Ephes
[1:26:50] areas like Syria and Iran.
[1:26:54] Amen. Amen. Now,
[1:26:57] Russia need to use that action.
[1:27:02] When America need to invade Iran
[1:27:07] to get a place near,
[1:27:10] Iraq,
[1:27:11] Iraq, Amen. Amen. And Iraq, Iraq, Amen,
[1:27:15] is the place where Abraham was born.
[1:27:21] You see things are just happening there
[1:27:25] in the Middle East
[1:27:27] because the Middle East
[1:27:30] has brought the attention
[1:27:32] of everybody
[1:27:35] because it's where the city of God
[1:27:39] is. Is where the garden of Eden.
[1:27:44] Now the devil know that is coming to
[1:27:49] block that.
[1:27:56] Amen. Amen. You cannot block block God.
[1:28:00] Amen. Amen. What is happening in this
[1:28:03] world
[1:28:05] is something that already
[1:28:08] God has planned.
[1:28:11] Can you bring something different?
[1:28:15] Can you live here and try to build
[1:28:18] something?
[1:28:20] that you think is absolute
[1:28:23] wasting your time.
[1:28:25] God has done a complete job.
[1:28:32] If God has done a complete job,
[1:28:35] there's nothing you can do. You must
[1:28:37] just conform
[1:28:40] to what God has done.
[1:28:42] Amen. Amen. You see now within that
[1:28:46] three and a half years
[1:28:48] what is happening the tribulation as
[1:28:51] well is there
[1:28:53] during the tribulation first seal I read
[1:28:57] here's what I want you to notice
[1:29:01] a little thing I dropped in here during
[1:29:05] the tribulation
[1:29:09] after the bride
[1:29:11] being called up and A church goes
[1:29:15] through tribulation.
[1:29:17] The 140,000
[1:29:20] 140
[1:29:22] 144,000
[1:29:24] 144,000 is called by the two witness
[1:29:28] of revelation chapter 11.
[1:29:31] Now look, they'll prophesy
[1:29:34] 1,23
[1:29:38] score days
[1:29:41] cloth insect cloth.
[1:29:44] The sixth seal
[1:29:47] is the tribulation period.
[1:29:51] In that three and a half years,
[1:29:55] Israel
[1:29:57] get to know Messiah.
[1:30:00] The bride is there in the wedding
[1:30:03] supper.
[1:30:06] The church that disbelieve the word of
[1:30:07] God
[1:30:09] is going through.
[1:30:13] Amen. Amen. That what is happening. But
[1:30:16] I want to tell you this. Brother
[1:30:19] Brennham said, "I preached like Paul."
[1:30:23] When I preach like Paul, the message of
[1:30:26] the first church age
[1:30:28] will be like the message of the last.
[1:30:32] When the message of the last church
[1:30:35] come to an end, the bride is complete.
[1:30:39] And brother Brenam says, "The seventh
[1:30:42] seal who brought him down and at the end
[1:30:46] of the church age They are going up in
[1:30:50] the sky. No matter what is happening,
[1:30:55] we are no long in the loudian church. We
[1:30:59] are in the brightness.
[1:31:02] Now you start to think as a son and a
[1:31:06] daughter.
[1:31:08] We have passed the church. We are in the
[1:31:11] bright gate. That means time is no more
[1:31:16] at any time
[1:31:19] take place. When it takes place all what
[1:31:23] Putin
[1:31:26] and Iran what what they think about
[1:31:30] should be done. You know why some of the
[1:31:33] things are not
[1:31:36] because you are stealing.
[1:31:38] You have so much power to hold the
[1:31:42] intelligence
[1:31:43] of Russia and America. You can't do
[1:31:46] anything while you are still here.
[1:31:51] Look how poor you are. You don't have
[1:31:53] money. You don't have you don't have a
[1:31:56] job. You have nothing. But you have
[1:31:59] power. Stop all those.
[1:32:02] You are still here. Nothing will not
[1:32:05] happen.
[1:32:06] That means I'm saying we don't have to
[1:32:09] worry.
[1:32:11] They can talk and do whatever.
[1:32:15] God forbid the day we live.
[1:32:19] Amen. Amen. That lamp will show the
[1:32:23] world
[1:32:25] not what you think I
[1:32:28] position
[1:32:30] the people through the tribulation
[1:32:34] three and a half years. People will be
[1:32:36] tormented.
[1:32:38] The Bible says they will even while the
[1:32:42] stone from the mountain will fall upon
[1:32:47] them and the death will say
[1:32:57] the sixth seal.
[1:33:01] The sixth seal is the tribulation
[1:33:04] period. Amen.
[1:33:08] That's what takes place.
[1:33:11] Amen. Amen. Now the good part says the
[1:33:14] price has gone.
[1:33:19] Amen. Amen. There's no living creature.
[1:33:23] Nothing there to say it. It's just now
[1:33:26] God is dealing
[1:33:28] with the church. We God is dealing
[1:33:34] now. God is not dealing. Yes.
[1:33:38] God is not dealing with the church no
[1:33:41] more.
[1:33:43] It's been gone.
[1:33:46] He's dealing with Israel.
[1:33:50] This is the other side.
[1:33:52] This is when Israel
[1:33:55] received the message of the kingdom by
[1:33:59] the two prophets
[1:34:01] of revelation.
[1:34:05] Amen. Amen. Abraham says God is dealing
[1:34:10] with Israel
[1:34:12] as a nation is dealing with Gentiles
[1:34:17] as individuals.
[1:34:21] That is why when you come to a decision,
[1:34:26] you do it individually
[1:34:30] because it's between you
[1:34:34] and God.
[1:34:36] Amen. Amen. But with Israel, it's a
[1:34:39] collective.
[1:34:41] It's a nation of God. You are a bride of
[1:34:44] God.
[1:34:46] You are judges.
[1:34:51] Brother Brenham says, "When a preacher
[1:34:55] is behind the
[1:34:57] he judgment."
[1:34:59] But the children of God judge from the
[1:35:02] pullpit.
[1:35:04] You cannot be judged
[1:35:06] in the white throne church
[1:35:09] because you create everything.
[1:35:15] Amen.
[1:35:16] Amen.
[1:35:18] Amen. Amen. To show that you will be
[1:35:22] eternally in the new city,
[1:35:26] you must be in the rapture.
[1:35:28] Amen. Amen. You must be in the thousand
[1:35:31] years.
[1:35:33] You must be a judge in the word of God.
[1:35:37] Then you will be.
[1:35:41] Amen. Amen. Three and a half years
[1:35:45] is time. Thousand years is time. Western
[1:35:50] judgment.
[1:35:54] And make
[1:35:56] time. New Jerusalem
[1:36:00] is eternal.
[1:36:02] [Applause]
[1:36:07] So we'll go time after time.
[1:36:10] And what I like about God, he's doing
[1:36:14] this for us.
[1:36:19] Amen. Don't even try harder.
[1:36:22] No, God has done a comp
[1:36:28] brother and sisters. What is due to you?
[1:36:32] What is due to you? The conditions can
[1:36:35] come.
[1:36:37] They will never stop the plan of God.
[1:36:40] God is doing something deliberately.
[1:36:44] The war between Iran
[1:36:46] and Isra just a wake up call is just
[1:36:50] telling you that anytime from now after
[1:36:56] anything can happen.
[1:37:00] Amen. Amen. Russia is sustaining there.
[1:37:12] He won't hit you, but let the bride
[1:37:15] leave.
[1:37:18] I hit you and tear you down.
[1:37:22] Why? The mercy of God is gone.
[1:37:29] [Music]
[1:37:31] Amen. Amen. When the mercy of God is
[1:37:34] gone,
[1:37:35] the cleing of teeth
[1:37:40] is something that you cannot wish
[1:37:44] someone to do.
[1:37:46] But it's not us. It's God himself doing
[1:37:50] it because Paul the other say
[1:37:54] if it was possible.
[1:37:57] I wish this message
[1:38:00] that I preach I can preach it to my home
[1:38:05] state so that they can believe and
[1:38:08] understand who God is. But it's not in
[1:38:12] my will. I can't do nothing is the will
[1:38:16] of God. It is our wish as well to preach
[1:38:19] to the people that they can believe that
[1:38:22] is not within our right to make
[1:38:27] God himself. Let me tell you one thing.
[1:38:32] The stand,
[1:38:34] the stand you took, the stand you took
[1:38:39] according to Revelation chapter 12
[1:38:42] is the stand that sustain you today.
[1:38:49] Amen. Amen. Those that believe the word
[1:38:52] of God,
[1:38:54] they shall believe the word of God. And
[1:38:56] God knew he put you the last age
[1:39:01] so that rapture. He could have put you
[1:39:06] during the time of Noah. He could have
[1:39:08] put you during the time of Daniel. But
[1:39:12] he decided to put you at the right time
[1:39:17] according to the plan of God.
[1:39:20] plant you just unfold you and here you
[1:39:24] are this morning.
[1:39:27] You can just sing as a mine eyes have
[1:39:30] seen the glory coming forth
[1:39:34] that that's all you can say merciful God
[1:39:38] brotherham says
[1:39:41] line between us and the unbeliever
[1:39:45] but the grace
[1:39:49] Amen. Brothers and sisters, there are
[1:39:51] more people that are intelligent
[1:39:55] than you are,
[1:39:57] but they don't see what you see. They
[1:40:01] don't understand what you understand.
[1:40:04] But you can't even write your name.
[1:40:08] You were never in the classroom. But God
[1:40:12] brought that wisdom, eternal wisdom.
[1:40:18] It's not about what a man think. What a
[1:40:21] man think
[1:40:23] limited
[1:40:25] think.
[1:40:33] Go and call all the professors.
[1:40:36] Let them sit here. I will preach here
[1:40:39] and they will go home and never come
[1:40:41] back. This was never made for them.
[1:40:45] was made for you.
[1:40:48] Wisdom,
[1:40:51] you don't have a right to boost
[1:40:54] of what you think you have.
[1:40:57] Amen. Amen. The missiles in Iran in
[1:41:02] their intelligency is now ashes. The
[1:41:06] buildings in Tel Aiv,
[1:41:10] the wisdom of a man come to an end. God
[1:41:14] is taking us somewhere.
[1:41:18] Anytime we go.
[1:41:24] Amen.
[1:41:28] I love to listen to Trump.
[1:41:32] He love the Bible. He quote the
[1:41:35] scripture and he know something's about
[1:41:37] to happen. That's why he came for
[1:41:40] president again
[1:41:42] so that he can do what he do and he
[1:41:46] realized that is God using him and that
[1:41:50] is true.
[1:41:51] [Applause]
[1:41:54] Amen. Amen. I come in the name of peace.
[1:42:04] He kills you in the name of peace.
[1:42:08] Amen. Amen. And no one can challenge it.
[1:42:12] When Ukraine Ukraine go to America, they
[1:42:16] were shaking. When France go to America,
[1:42:20] they were shaking. When UK meet, Canada,
[1:42:25] they are shaking because you can't deny
[1:42:28] America super power.
[1:42:32] Amen. Amen. They can deal with you very
[1:42:36] hard.
[1:42:38] is the lamb. You see now this Bible says
[1:42:43] the truth. When you read the Bible,
[1:42:46] reading the book of Revelation chapter
[1:42:48] 13,
[1:42:50] you read and pass. But a child of God
[1:42:53] will want to know what is this lamb
[1:42:57] and that lamb is America. Now we read
[1:43:01] about the prince of Mishak and Dub. You
[1:43:05] just read and pass. But a child of God
[1:43:08] will tell you is Russia.
[1:43:15] Amen. Amen. Now
[1:43:18] the attention
[1:43:20] is between America
[1:43:24] and Russia.
[1:43:26] Israel is in the middle.
[1:43:29] Donald Trump says if you touch Israel
[1:43:33] touch me then Russia says if you touch
[1:43:36] Iran touch me
[1:43:40] that's what is happening and what goes
[1:43:43] next
[1:43:45] goes to the third world war
[1:43:49] Russia will say China are you joining or
[1:43:53] not
[1:43:54] will say I come India will say I come
[1:43:57] India, North Korea will say then America
[1:44:00] will say UK, France, France, Iraq, Iraq
[1:44:05] and then South Africa are you still
[1:44:08] neutral
[1:44:10] going for a war
[1:44:13] because our country sometimes you don't
[1:44:15] know whether he's going forward
[1:44:21] South Africa has got about more than 60
[1:44:23] million people
[1:44:26] but I was reading
[1:44:28] the troops in South Africa.
[1:44:31] South Africa is the land of peace.
[1:44:34] We don't have soldiers there below
[1:44:37] 20,000,000
[1:44:39] to fight with. Do you understand? Amen.
[1:44:42] So my my grandfather
[1:44:45] fought in the World War II
[1:44:49] Europe but they were conned that they
[1:44:54] should support
[1:44:57] World War II happened
[1:45:00] getting other country
[1:45:03] and they started to fight.
[1:45:06] Now the third world war the war of
[1:45:09] Armageddon
[1:45:12] is to wipe off everything.
[1:45:15] America will never raise the flag.
[1:45:20] Will never raise the flag. China will
[1:45:22] never reach the flag. The whole world
[1:45:26] will be wiped out.
[1:45:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:45:32] Amen. Countdown. Countdown spoken word.
[1:45:36] And now the door is just about to close.
[1:45:42] at the
[1:45:45] last
[1:45:46] countdown.
[1:45:48] And the church
[1:45:50] is fixing to take its orbit
[1:45:55] above all tribulation,
[1:45:58] all everything.
[1:46:01] and saw its way
[1:46:04] to the heavens
[1:46:07] of heaven carrying the church
[1:46:11] to the bosom of God.
[1:46:13] [Music]

[1:46:54] throwing missile, Russia throwing
[1:46:56] missile, China throwing missile.
[1:46:59] You know it will be chaos.
[1:47:02] The very same weapon that they made
[1:47:06] ended up killing them.
[1:47:10] brothers and sisters and Putin knows
[1:47:13] about it.
[1:47:15] Know about it.
[1:47:18] Donald Trump knows about they know the
[1:47:22] the the weapon they have.
[1:47:24] They call it mass destruction.
[1:47:29] If they destruct the mass
[1:47:33] who will be left behind
[1:47:35] is the end of human race.
[1:47:39] We will be going from glory to glory.
[1:47:44] Taking all those steps
[1:47:47] from eternal and looking at the world
[1:47:50] when it passes into ashes.
[1:47:58] Brothers and sisters, what I'm saying

[1:48:04] happening. Go and look. will tell me.

[1:48:17] yourself. Read it again until you see
[1:48:20] yourself.

[1:50:29] Russia. America and Russia will never

[1:51:07] I made that mistake to return.
[1:51:10] I want to break the neck of

[1:51:18] and realize
[1:51:22] then he said to Zen King, "Surrender.

[1:59:33] It's a place of refuge
[1:59:36] and then it's in the house of Abraham.
[1:59:42] When you came into that house,
[1:59:45] you said, "Is there anything
[1:59:48] that I can hide
[1:59:52] before my servant Abraham
[1:59:55] before I destroy this sodom and Lord,
[2:00:00] you did everything."

[2:00:09] Christ.
[2:00:12] We are happy to be married to you my
[2:00:15] God.
[2:00:17] Indeed, this is the secrets
[2:00:21] that the husband is giving to the wife.

[2:01:07] plan.
[2:01:09] And Lord, he came and he expounded
[2:01:13] everything unto us
[2:01:17] through our pastor.
[2:01:26] It is going home time now.
[2:01:30] Indeed, there is nothing that we need to
[2:01:32] do.
[2:01:34] We know that we are with you.
[2:01:38] We are standing early in the morning
[2:01:40] where Abraham stood with the Lord
[2:01:44] and we can see and we can tell what is
[2:01:47] happening.

[2:02:41] to your children. We love you our
[2:02:44] husband. We love you our God. We give
[2:02:49] you all the honor and the glory. Thank
[2:02:53] you for what you have done for us.
[2:03:06] We are much aware of what is happening.

[2:03:17] We are watching him.
[2:03:20] We are watching him. We know what is
[2:03:23] happening. But my God
[2:03:32] You know what blesses us? What makes us
[2:03:35] happy is that all these things
[2:03:39] when they happen we will not be around.
[2:03:43] Thank you for that.

[2:03:53] in a war.

[2:21:32] bless you.
[2:21:38] Can we bow our heads?
[2:21:40] Dear heavenly father, thou creator of
[2:21:43] all heavens, the earth and beneath.
[2:21:47] Father, this afternoon we have he had
[2:21:50] your word. As we are approaching this
[2:21:53] baptismal service, Father, you gave us
[2:21:56] the word. Your children are here.
[2:21:59] They've come from all walks of the
[2:22:03] world. Father, we have heard your word
[2:22:06] as your bride. Father, you spoke to us
[2:22:09] in a very special way. It was as it was
[2:22:12] in those days when Peter stood
[2:22:17] when he was telling them that the same
[2:22:20] Jesus that they've crucified
[2:22:24] God have make him Lord and Christ.
[2:22:27] And the Bible says they were pricked in
[2:22:30] their hearts. They said what shall we
[2:22:33] do?
[2:22:34] He said to them repent each and every
[2:22:37] one of you and be baptized in the name
[2:22:40] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[2:22:43] remissions of sins.
[2:22:45] Father, we are here with the souls
[2:22:48] through the word that you spoke. They've
[2:22:52] repented, Lord. They're coming to get a
[2:22:56] new heart,
[2:22:57] a new conscience, Lord, yourself, Lord,
[2:23:01] to come into their hearts, Father.
[2:23:04] Father, this baptismal is not just
[2:23:07] washing of the body, but is to get a
[2:23:11] clean conscious
[2:23:13] your mind. Lord, one day you spoke and
[2:23:16] you said, "Let the mind that was in
[2:23:18] Christ to be in us, Father." So today
[2:23:22] they're here, Lord, to identify
[2:23:24] themselves with the bride of the Lord
[2:23:26] Jesus Christ. They here Lord to bury the
[2:23:30] old man and receive a new man.
[2:23:35] Father, we are here because of their
[2:23:36] predestination.
[2:23:38] By your forn knowledge, you chose them,
[2:23:40] Lord, and wrote their names in the
[2:23:44] Lamb's Book of Life. They've heard you,
[2:23:46] Lord, calling their names. They're here,
[2:23:49] Lord, to be baptized. And we are here,
[2:23:52] Lord, telling Satan that he does not
[2:23:55] have part because, Lord, you died for
[2:23:58] them.
[2:24:00] This is a sign that we died with you,
[2:24:03] Lord. We buried with you and we rose
[2:24:06] again. And Lord, we believe that as they
[2:24:10] are going to be baptized, Lord, it's a
[2:24:13] symbol of burial
[2:24:16] that they have been buried, Lord, with
[2:24:18] you and they are rising with you, Lord.
[2:24:21] And you'll come inside them and lead
[2:24:24] them and guide them, Lord. As we are
[2:24:26] standing here, we are eyewitnesses,
[2:24:29] Lord, of these things that you are doing
[2:24:31] in this last days. Lord, calling your
[2:24:34] children to be baptized, Lord, in the
[2:24:36] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the
[2:24:38] remission of their sins, in the mighty
[2:24:41] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:24:43] Christ. Amen.
[2:24:45] [Applause]
[2:24:53] We read Acts chapter 2 from verse 36-39.
[2:24:58] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[2:25:00] know assuredly that God hath made that
[2:25:03] same Jesus, whom he hath crucified, both
[2:25:06] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[2:25:10] this, they were pricricked in their
[2:25:11] heart, and said unto Peter, and to the
[2:25:14] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[2:25:17] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[2:25:20] them,"repent and be baptized, every one
[2:25:23] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[2:25:25] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[2:25:28] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[2:25:30] the promise is unto you and to your
[2:25:33] children, and to all that are a far off,
[2:25:36] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[2:25:39] call."
[2:25:43] Amen.
