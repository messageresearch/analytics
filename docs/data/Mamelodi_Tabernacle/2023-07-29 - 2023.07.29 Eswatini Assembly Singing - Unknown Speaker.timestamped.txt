[16:29] let's close our eyes
[16:32] most gracious Heavenly Father
[16:35] Lord God you are the creator of the
[16:37] heavens and the Earth
[16:39] Lord you are the author in the finisher
[16:42] of our souls
[16:44] Heavenly Father you are the lily of the
[16:46] valley
[16:47] you are the Bright Morning Star
[16:50] Heavenly Father this morning
[16:53] this evening Heavenly Father
[16:55] we understand that even in the time of
[16:59] old
[17:00] Lord you would come to your son Adam
[17:03] heavenly father in the evening time
[17:06] and you would speak to him heavenly
[17:08] father concerning the day Heavenly
[17:11] Father here are your children almighty
[17:14] God
[17:15] these children oh Lord they were in the
[17:18] back part of your mind
[17:20] heavenly father there were those Souls
[17:22] there were those angels who fought the
[17:25] devil heavenly father they were behind
[17:27] Michael heavenly father and they
[17:30] conquered him and Heavenly Father those
[17:33] angels were subject to become human and
[17:36] they are here today heavenly father to
[17:39] continue to manifest heavenly father and
[17:42] almighty God
[17:44] we listened to our pastor almighty God
[17:47] last week and he said if the word of God
[17:51] is not manifest Heavenly Father it is
[17:54] nothing but just a weed and the heavenly
[17:57] father it is nothing almighty God
[18:00] because each and every word of God must
[18:02] come down and make flesh and if we are
[18:06] the children of God Heavenly Father we
[18:08] must be made flesh also because even our
[18:12] father heavenly father he was the word
[18:16] and the Word was with him and the word
[18:19] the heavenly father was God and it came
[18:23] and it was made flesh so each and every
[18:26] word of God it must be made flesh no
[18:29] wonder Heavenly Father we know that even
[18:32] now Lord you will come and you will
[18:34] speak to us heavenly father in the form
[18:37] of a man heavenly father but we know
[18:40] that inside of that man Heavenly Father
[18:43] it is the way it is Melchizedek just
[18:46] that he's just veiled in a man in a
[18:49] flesh and we know that heavenly father
[18:51] he is Melchizedek because almighty God
[18:55] we are just the citizens of Salem and
[18:59] the citizens of Salem they are here now
[19:01] Gathering Together heavenly father to
[19:04] take those final Heavenly Father
[19:07] um to take those uh those uh last words
[19:11] on the runway heavenly father to make
[19:14] them to take off to the Rapture and
[19:17] Heavenly Father we are here to listen to
[19:19] you even now almighty God we know that
[19:22] you have not brought us here in vain but
[19:25] you shall speak to us and you shall and
[19:28] you have already prepared for us
[19:30] something special because we are special
[19:33] people to you thank you Heaven father
[19:36] even now Lord we know that whenever the
[19:40] children of God are gathered together we
[19:42] know that the devil is always there and
[19:44] he is always trying to create chaos but
[19:47] heavenly father he is a defeated fool
[19:50] and he has got no power even now the
[19:53] power is now in the bride the power has
[19:56] been given to us to chase out the devils
[19:59] not to the Devils to chase us but we
[20:02] have the power to chase the devil even
[20:04] now Satan you have no power because the
[20:07] angel of the Lord is swinging around
[20:09] this sword even now around Heavenly
[20:11] Father we know that nothing shall happen
[20:14] to us and you the word of God shall be
[20:16] delivered with no disturbance heavenly
