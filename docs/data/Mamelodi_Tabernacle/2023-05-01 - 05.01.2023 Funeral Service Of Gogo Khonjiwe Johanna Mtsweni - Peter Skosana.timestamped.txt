[26:11] foreign
[26:22] friends and colleagues
[26:26] um
[26:28] it was tribute to ephemely
[26:31] I'm here standing paying tribute to my
[26:35] mother-in-law
[26:36] what a blessing
[26:38] foreign
[26:44] foreign
[26:51] because it's only the word that can
[26:54] shape you and align you and make you do
[26:57] things the right way
[26:59] about one of them
[27:04] you're proud to say that I'm the best
[27:07] daughter in law and even
[27:10] where they are they are saying we are
[27:13] the proudest daughters in law because
[27:15] safigula isn't is Anthony is they were
[27:18] born again you know everything you know
[27:21] the best institution that you could ever
[27:24] have for all the families and the
[27:27] relationship is God because um
[27:33] but we make an error that we consider
[27:37] other things and not consider God who
[27:39] instituted us
[27:45] with friends every every relationship
[27:48] it's there in the word of God because
[27:59] she was a special woman in my life and
[28:02] in all of us being a jungle Bank
[28:09] um
[28:10] she was the same thing that she did to
[28:13] me she did to others she was unique and
[28:16] then you know she didn't even give us
[28:18] pressure
[28:26] she will Embrace us and she will love us
[28:30] even my father-in-law because you could
[28:32] see that you know Elizabeth
[28:35] you know when I was a young person I was
[28:38] praying with this this best friend of
[28:41] mine we're praying
[28:43] and so it was it was it was like dead
[28:46] Sasha telems in I remember when I came
[28:49] to Honeymoon back to Honeymoon
[28:57] 5 o'clock
[29:17] foreign
[29:23] foreign
[29:40] [Music]
[30:11] and because he gave me the permission I
[30:14] excelled in cooking
[30:18] so um
[30:35] so the best thing out of all because we
[30:37] are paying tribute to my mother-in-law
[30:39] I'm not crying I'm celebrating the life
[30:42] that I spent with her she loved me I
[30:45] loved her and I did everything that I
[30:48] could ever done to her you know it was
[30:51] not about money it is
[30:54] whatever I could have done to her I did
[30:57] hence we we build a good relationships
[31:15] foreign
[31:52] foreign
[32:01] [Applause]
[33:11] because I said it's my mother it's not
[33:13] my mother-in-law the law officially gave
[33:16] me to be my mother so the same way that
[33:19] I treat my mother is the same way that I
[33:21] must treat my mother-in-law so greetings
[33:23] her father that is
[33:28] lastly as I'm I'm closing and
[33:31] appreciating um is is
[33:35] appeal you know um
[33:46] it absorbs so if a man's anger Lily yeah
[33:51] if it's an acid I absorb if a mans are
[33:55] clean yeah absolutely
[33:56] absorb so he said life is like that um
[34:00] because there are so many things in this
[34:03] world but it depends on you what is
[34:08] because if uh
[34:12] but you won't see it okay the only thing
[34:16] that you will see it is when you start
[34:18] squeezing it when squish it is a release
[34:21] I learned to a absolute so that is why I
[34:24] said you know in here I absorb so many
[34:26] things from my mother-in-law hence when
[34:28] challenges are coming like this all I
[34:30] can squeeze are the good things and the
[34:33] good memories that then the relationship
[34:35] that I have with my mother-in-law I
[34:37] never regretted it you know I'm the last
[34:40] person
[34:42] and she died I think I was still in the
[34:45] hospital when the way they explained and
[34:48] I made him to talk
[34:50] and you could see the excitement that
[34:52] was happening it was um
[35:00] so I squeezing in my spirit I'm
[35:04] squeezing good things I'm Excuse me the
[35:06] teaching that my mother-in-law must
[35:08] listen together he was encouraging us
[35:10] and telling us
[35:12] because I mean I didn't have an
[35:14] experience of being a daughter-in-law it
[35:16] was the first time I get married
[35:21] it was the first time to be yeah but
[35:23] what shaped us to be like this only the
[35:26] weight trust in God and Trust in the
[35:29] weight it will shape you and make you
[35:31] the person to become
[35:36] but you know the greatest teacher and
[35:38] the greatest institution that can that
[35:40] can be is God in his way when you align
[35:43] him your marriage will never fail your
[35:45] in-laws will never fail you no matter
[35:47] how difficult it is whether you will
[35:49] give the best out of the past and you
[35:51] will reap the best out of the best
[35:53] because what you sow is what you reap

[47:02] God
[47:07] you know as Christians
[47:13] our lives are cultured by the word
[47:21] and our lives ought to preach the gospel
[47:29] it's not about what we say but
[47:33] Our lives our actions everything about
[47:35] us
[47:37] ought to preach the Gospels
[47:45] and this is what I saw from OK Google

[47:56] him
[48:01] about how she believed and trusted in

[1:00:53] he was introducing me
[1:00:58] he said we'll call our Elder what is
[1:01:02] this is
[1:01:03] he did not say a pasta
[1:01:09] so yesterday I was saying
[1:01:12] please pray for me
[1:01:17] so that I don't
[1:01:19] um brag about myself because they are my
[1:01:22] pastors
[1:01:27] they are supposed preaching here
[1:01:34] so
[1:01:36] I don't know what they've seen in me
[1:01:39] um
[1:01:44] we've been together in the field for
[1:01:47] many years
[1:01:52] and I also like to greet our pasta from

[1:02:33] in the name of my Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:38] my name is

[1:02:47] and then I said yesterday
[1:02:51] [Music]
[1:02:52] um
[1:02:54] uh I'm one of the proud
[1:03:00] because I
[1:03:04] there's always a saying about us among
[1:03:06] the world
[1:03:10] which is
[1:03:13] we are believers in summer
[1:03:19] in winter time we forget that we are
[1:03:22] believers
[1:03:24] since I repented have been
[1:03:27] a Christian All Seasons
[1:03:35] okay let's just read the the word
[1:03:40] in the Book of Luke and what in galuka
[1:03:43] Saint Luke chapter 17.
[1:03:49] 17.
[1:03:51] once again to explain why are we using
[1:03:54] English
[1:03:59] because in our assembly
[1:04:03] we've got quite a number of branches
[1:04:09] and different people in different
[1:04:11] languages
[1:04:24] some understand only English
[1:04:28] so there is a live streaming so
[1:04:32] um
[1:04:35] so they are watching us
[1:04:39] so we like to accommodate everybody
[1:04:49] um
[1:04:54] let's read
[1:04:57] Luke 17 let's read from the 20th verse
[1:05:02] up to the 30th verse 10 verses
[1:05:05] 30.
[1:05:12] now it says and when
[1:05:15] he was demanded of the Pharisees when
[1:05:18] the kingdom of God should come he
[1:05:21] answered them and said the kingdom of
[1:05:23] God cometh not with observation
[1:05:27] foreign
[1:05:40] [Music]
[1:05:43] um
[1:05:45] neither should they say law here
[1:05:48] or lower the or therefore
[1:05:52] behold the kingdom of God is within you
[1:05:56] 40.
[1:06:06] and you say it unto his disciples
[1:06:10] the days will come when you shall desire
[1:06:13] to see one of the days of the son of man
[1:06:15] and you shall not see it is
[1:06:32] and
[1:06:33] they shall say to you see here
[1:06:37] or
[1:06:38] see there
[1:06:40] go not after them no follow them
[1:06:46] Nancy
[1:06:53] for as the lightning that lighted out of
[1:06:56] the one out of the one part of under
[1:07:00] Heaven shine it unto the other part
[1:07:03] under heaven so shall also the son of
[1:07:05] man be in his day
[1:07:08] but
[1:07:24] first must he suffer many things and be
[1:07:27] rejected of this generation
[1:07:39] and as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:07:42] shall it be also in the days of the son
[1:07:45] of man
[1:07:46] says
[1:07:52] each they drank they married wives they
[1:07:56] were giving in marriage until the day
[1:07:58] that Noah entered into the ark and the
[1:08:02] flood came and destroyed them all
[1:08:08] was
[1:08:17] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:08:20] Lord they did eat they drank
[1:08:23] they bought they sold they planted they
[1:08:27] build it
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:08:39] but the same thing that lot went out of
[1:08:43] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:08:46] heaven and Destroy them allotted
[1:08:59] events even thus shall it be in the day
[1:09:03] when the son of man is revealed
[1:09:11] let's power our heads up
[1:09:16] gracious Lord
[1:09:19] we are gathered here Lord Almighty in
[1:09:21] the funeral service of our
[1:09:24] sister
[1:09:26] of which we believe Lord Almighty is in
[1:09:28] the sixth dimension
[1:09:30] father we are gathered here as
[1:09:34] people that
[1:09:36] has got a revelation of the weight
[1:09:40] knowing that all the Mysteries
[1:09:43] that were hidden
[1:09:45] are now revealed Lord
[1:09:48] so for us it's just to bring the
[1:09:51] manifestation of what has been revealed
[1:09:54] and father as the word says let he that
[1:09:58] is filthy
[1:09:59] be filthy still and that he that is Holy
[1:10:04] be holy still amen bless this family or
[1:10:08] Lord and bless everybody that has
[1:10:09] gathered here
[1:10:11] may you be the one Lord Almighty that
[1:10:14] will preach to us father we pray in the
[1:10:17] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:19] amen
[1:10:20] amen you may be seated
[1:10:27] okay
[1:10:28] um
[1:10:28] the scripture that we have read
[1:10:31] um
[1:10:33] touches much about the son of man
[1:10:41] touches much about the kingdom of God
[1:10:47] and then it says here it is a kingdom of
[1:10:52] God cometh not with observation it is
[1:10:59] now actually why should we read the word
[1:11:04] of God in a funeral is
[1:11:10] or in most of the occasions
[1:11:16] it is very essential
[1:11:19] that men should know about God
[1:11:24] because he's the creator of Heaven and
[1:11:28] Earth
[1:11:31] and then you should have an
[1:11:33] understanding why
[1:11:35] have God created you now
[1:11:41] why are you here on this planet Earth
[1:11:46] how do you involve yourself
[1:11:50] in this world okay
[1:11:56] there are prophecies
[1:12:00] and then those prophecies propheto need
[1:12:04] to be manifested
[1:12:08] uh we should know what are those
[1:12:11] professors
[1:12:14] concerning us let us Prophet
[1:12:18] otherwise our life will be in vain if we
[1:12:21] don't know that um
[1:12:24] we should always remind ourselves
[1:12:29] about prophecies that concerns us
[1:12:36] prophecies that are directed to us
[1:12:41] we should know that we have Dimensions
[1:12:53] we should know in which dimension is she
[1:12:56] now
[1:13:00] and we should also know that we have
[1:13:03] different bodies
[1:13:07] the body that we wear like the one I'm
[1:13:11] wearing now
[1:13:14] if I depart
[1:13:17] it does not mean that's the end of
[1:13:19] myself
[1:13:30] that will be a consolation to the family
[1:13:32] otherwise
[1:13:36] uh
[1:13:43] it will be a Perpetual
[1:13:47] wounds
[1:13:49] because they've lost their loved ones
[1:13:55] but in order to be in a right position
[1:14:01] they should know actually where she is
[1:14:04] right now together
[1:14:10] thing that we need to remind ourselves
[1:14:12] is the dispensations
[1:14:19] otherwise to worship God
[1:14:22] it's a good thing
[1:14:25] but you should know the dispensation
[1:14:27] that you are in because
[1:14:33] there is a dispensation that has got
[1:14:36] power within itself
[1:14:41] you know there was a woman
[1:14:44] who said to our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:53] Jesus Christ son of David please have
[1:14:56] mercy on me
[1:14:57] so she misplaced him wow
[1:15:06] Jesus the son of David
[1:15:10] and yet
[1:15:11] he was the son of man bullets
[1:15:16] he was in the dispensation of the son of
[1:15:19] man this is
[1:15:20] [Music]
[1:15:23] so when you call him and when you
[1:15:26] misplace him
[1:15:28] um
[1:15:31] uh that sort of uh slowed down your
[1:15:36] prayer knock okay
[1:15:40] slow down your anointing with this is
[1:15:44] because he recognized that you don't
[1:15:47] know him we are born when I'm born
[1:15:51] are we together it's okay so we also
[1:15:55] have to remind each other
[1:15:59] about the world and the Earth
[1:16:03] that we are in this planet
[1:16:06] Earth
[1:16:09] and then what is happening in this earth
[1:16:14] there is uh things that are happening
[1:16:19] which we call them the worldly things
[1:16:25] are we together
[1:16:28] then the last thing is
[1:16:31] we should not forget about the promises
[1:16:36] there are promises
[1:16:40] uh
[1:16:42] that pertains to us
[1:16:46] yes
[1:16:47] not the promises that are not directed
[1:16:51] to us I eat and peace
[1:16:54] a promise that is not directed to you
[1:16:57] will not benefit you it's 10 billion is
[1:17:03] it should be a promise
[1:17:06] that is yours
[1:17:08] and when you know that you have a
[1:17:10] promise
[1:17:12] that's why you direct all the power
[1:17:18] because in that promise
[1:17:21] it's your life
[1:17:24] but if you leave just the other people
[1:17:27] live just like any person almost
[1:17:32] then you are taking a wrong direction
[1:17:36] when you leave
[1:17:38] um you must know why are you living
[1:17:41] because
[1:17:44] what should you do because
[1:17:53] [Applause]
[1:18:04] you
[1:18:11] don't know where
[1:18:14] is the word directed in yourself
[1:18:20] there is this physical part which is a
[1:18:23] temporary part
[1:18:27] of this body which is temporal always
[1:18:31] and we should know that
[1:18:35] uh there is a spirit
[1:18:38] that gives lives to this body
[1:18:43] are we together okay and there is a part
[1:18:46] in this body
[1:18:48] but when God speaks
[1:18:51] the word is directed to a certain part
[1:18:54] it is
[1:18:57] the Bible says
[1:19:00] he he is knocking
[1:19:11] now he was rejected by the uh by the
[1:19:15] world lawyers
[1:19:18] God was rejected by The World
[1:19:23] Isn't it and then
[1:19:26] he was also rejected by the so-called
[1:19:30] Christians
[1:19:33] until now he decided to concentrate on
[1:19:38] the individuals
[1:19:43] now he concentrates on the individuals
[1:19:47] according
[1:19:53] to the dispensation
[1:19:56] [Applause]
[1:19:58] there's a time when this cat when God
[1:20:03] came as a human being
[1:20:05] let me start from the from from Heaven
[1:20:08] Again
[1:20:10] the Bible says God is a spirit
[1:20:15] those that worship Him will worship Him
[1:20:19] in truth
[1:20:22] now if God is a spirit
[1:20:32] so he decided now why is we
[1:20:39] so that you could speak
[1:20:41] and you'll hear him um but you cannot
[1:20:45] see the weed is that is why God
[1:20:49] decided to form a body
[1:20:52] remember God
[1:20:56] um
[1:21:07] are we too good amen now if he hasn't
[1:21:10] got no relatives
[1:21:11] now when he speaks he said let us make
[1:21:16] man what he ascends and who is he
[1:21:19] speaking to listen plural let us
[1:21:25] make man
[1:21:28] are we together amen but he was all by
[1:21:31] himself
[1:21:35] which means he was speaking to uh with
[1:21:39] his mind
[1:21:40] he was speaking by uh by himself
[1:21:45] he was speaking to himself
[1:21:48] with the children of which his children
[1:21:52] that were in his mind
[1:21:55] let us make man
[1:21:58] in our image
[1:22:07] why okay now if God is a spirit
[1:22:11] then he is the one
[1:22:14] that created his own son
[1:22:18] amen the Bible says in the beginning
[1:22:21] God has got no beginning
[1:22:26] God has no beginning
[1:22:42] [Music]
[1:22:51] that was when he is processing himself
[1:22:56] you cannot worship God unless you know
[1:23:00] him um and we cannot worship God
[1:23:07] is
[1:23:09] but you must know his process
[1:23:14] so that you should know the God you are
[1:23:16] worshiping
[1:23:18] when he said let us make man um
[1:23:26] then when the Bible says in the
[1:23:30] beginning was the wait
[1:23:32] no he started the first person that he
[1:23:35] could easy
[1:23:46] [Applause]
[1:23:52] now there is a physical sign
[1:23:56] and there is a supernatural son
[1:24:00] Jesus Jesus was a physicalist
[1:24:04] but when he was baptized yesterday we
[1:24:07] read the scriptures
[1:24:11] which is the Spirit came down to Jesus
[1:24:17] that made Jesus the Lord
[1:24:24] [Music]
[1:24:28] let all the house of Israel
[1:24:32] Israeli let all the house of Israel know
[1:24:36] in Israeli young
[1:24:39] that this Jesus
[1:24:43] Christ
[1:24:49] has made him um
[1:24:52] Lord and Christ one man because
[1:24:56] it's not the second person
[1:24:59] is called himself
[1:25:03] the Bible says
[1:25:05] without
[1:25:07] discrepancies
[1:25:15] without control
[1:25:20] became flesh he came in because
[1:25:27] now that is the greatest challenge ever
[1:25:33] inside
[1:25:36] when our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:39] said my father um
[1:25:43] people were looking for a second person
[1:25:47] that is why he said the kingdom of God
[1:25:51] cometh not with observation
[1:26:49] [Music]
[1:26:54] it's very difficult to say
[1:27:17] [Applause]
[1:27:35] so now if it says the kingdom of God um
[1:27:43] uh
[1:27:45] in the time that you are living in
[1:27:47] escatism the word of God is
[1:27:51] wherever the king is there is a throne
[1:27:54] is
[1:27:57] when the king moves um
[1:28:02] the throne also moves
[1:28:05] when God descends
[1:28:08] came into Jesus
[1:28:11] the Throne of God was in Jesus
[1:28:16] that's why he said if you don't believe
[1:28:19] that I am him
[1:28:24] you will die in your sins
[1:28:27] because God was in Jesus
[1:28:32] and that made Jesus
[1:28:38] the body where God dwells
[1:28:42] are we together
[1:28:44] now in in in in in in in bringing the
[1:28:48] words of consolation
[1:28:51] is to bring the The Throne of God in the
[1:28:54] heart of men
[1:28:59] only the word of God
[1:29:02] that will reveal himself
[1:29:06] only the word of God that will console
[1:29:08] you is
[1:29:21] that is the body of the word
[1:29:23] um
[1:29:24] now
[1:29:26] the body that will resurrect um
[1:29:30] is the body that received the Revelation
[1:29:35] um
[1:29:40] you know there is a wage
[1:29:42] there is a revealed weight
[1:29:45] amen the word is just a general word
[1:29:49] [Music]
[1:29:50] but the Revelation I mean the word that
[1:29:54] is revealed is
[1:29:56] the manifestation of the prophets
[1:30:02] look if the prophecy says Uma is
[1:30:06] propheto city a virgin shall conceive
[1:30:10] it's a prophecy it's Prophet uh
[1:30:14] foreign
[1:30:46] I was preaching at the funeral yoga I
[1:30:50] think
[1:30:53] come on
[1:30:56] yes and then I had only 10 minutes they
[1:31:00] gave me only 10 minutes to preach 10
[1:31:03] minutes
[1:31:04] so I preached
[1:31:07] when the minutes was about to expire oh
[1:31:10] my little 10 minutes
[1:31:15] I preached two hours
[1:31:18] [Applause]
[1:31:36] so they gave me something like five
[1:31:38] minutes
[1:31:45] I've preached two hours
[1:31:50] so now here I believe the family they
[1:31:53] are Christians
[1:31:56] they are not against the preachers
[1:32:01] they are families that are very
[1:32:04] ancestrality
[1:32:07] of God
[1:32:10] we are not here to criticize anything
[1:32:18] so that we can all be convinced yes
[1:32:24] just nicely in a nice and informal way
[1:32:32] are we together now I was saying yeah
[1:32:36] the the the the Bible says
[1:32:41] uh
[1:32:44] uh invest22
[1:32:46] and he said unto his disciples
[1:32:51] the days will come
[1:32:53] when you shall desire to see one of the
[1:32:57] days of the son of man
[1:33:02] you shall not see it
[1:33:05] that was our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:08] speaking to his disciples
[1:33:11] remember he came as a son of
[1:33:15] Manchester United
[1:33:19] son of man is God in a human being
[1:33:27] in a human being that is what
[1:33:34] do they think I the son of man is
[1:33:45] you know
[1:33:47] the Christ
[1:33:49] God was a spirit
[1:33:53] then when he processed himself
[1:33:57] he became the witch the word is the
[1:34:01] pillar of fire is
[1:34:03] not so God is the pillar of fire
[1:34:06] Moses saw a pillar of fire um
[1:34:21] the angel of the Lord
[1:34:24] spoke from the pillars
[1:34:27] that's verse foreign
[1:34:55] different uh
[1:34:57] dispensations
[1:35:00] God can be an angel
[1:35:03] it can be called himself
[1:35:08] when he came
[1:35:11] as a man um
[1:35:16] so he came to act to express himself
[1:35:21] to manifest himself he wanted people
[1:35:25] wife
[1:35:35] together amen now he said unto them
[1:35:39] I am with you here I am God do you know
[1:35:43] that
[1:35:45] he says do you know that I am God
[1:35:50] he's saying that to his disciples
[1:35:54] who do you say that I the son of man am
[1:35:58] what is
[1:36:03] Christ
[1:36:05] hold it
[1:36:07] flesh and blood
[1:36:42] it's a revelation is
[1:36:46] [Applause]
[1:36:49] the Bible says ability there are those
[1:36:52] that are ordained for eternal life
[1:36:58] he revealed himself to those
[1:37:02] he himself
[1:37:04] look there was war in heaven
[1:37:07] you know that
[1:37:09] it was God himself fighting
[1:37:16] if I think the chair up
[1:37:18] who started mobilizing in heaven
[1:37:25] God became Michael
[1:37:28] um
[1:37:34] when God is fighting he becomes
[1:37:39] because if it's God um and defeat you
[1:37:43] you are going to say uh it's good
[1:37:54] the Bible says if I believe the devil
[1:37:57] recruited
[1:38:03] God remains
[1:38:11] the one that are predestinated
[1:38:15] [Music]
[1:38:16] [Applause]
[1:38:23] and they came and followed him
[1:38:30] [Applause]
[1:38:32] lives in a human being
[1:38:36] lives
[1:38:44] the spirit of God
[1:38:47] it does not dwell on the earth
[1:38:51] a human being stays there
[1:38:59] were anointed by the demons
[1:39:10] the Bible says
[1:40:09] thousands and thousands of churches
[1:40:14] God is not the author of confusion
[1:40:20] God will show you the right place
[1:40:24] what is the promise
[1:40:26] the promise is the changing of the body
[1:40:29] is
[1:40:31] actually born is waiting for the Lord
[1:40:35] everybody is waiting for the coming of
[1:40:37] the Lord
[1:40:39] are we together but the Bible says
[1:40:44] watch and pray
[1:40:48] he was reading that this morning
[1:40:56] but while you are watching um
[1:41:00] where would you be
[1:41:03] um where would you be fellowshipping
[1:41:08] it says accept the days be shortened
[1:41:12] um
[1:41:18] we have read the scriptures it says as
[1:41:22] it was
[1:41:32] also in the days of the son of man aims
[1:41:36] now he came as a son of man where is
[1:41:41] he was executed
[1:41:47] then from the one he went back
[1:41:51] remember that what happened is this
[1:41:55] on the day of Resurrection
[1:42:00] there were some sisters that saw him
[1:42:04] and then they wanted to touch him
[1:42:08] he said No don't touch me
[1:42:11] and then on that very same day
[1:42:14] in the evening
[1:42:16] Thomas came and touched him and put
[1:42:19] their fingers
[1:42:22] and the Bible says
[1:42:25] his spirit
[1:42:28] went back to God because when he was
[1:42:31] baptized the spirit went came to to
[1:42:35] Jesus
[1:42:38] and when he was supposed to be crucified
[1:42:42] that Spirit left him
[1:42:44] that's why in The Garden of kids
[1:42:48] he was praying
[1:42:51] and then his sweat became blood
[1:43:05] now that's one of the things that people
[1:43:07] get confused and say there's your God
[1:43:09] praying
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:15] and he says Our Father who is in heaven
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:43:23] what is he worshiping
[1:43:26] if you say this is god um
[1:43:31] there was an angel that was comforting
[1:43:34] him
[1:43:37] his soul went to hell why is right I
[1:43:43] mean and then what did he do in Hell
[1:43:46] Wednesday because when Peter said Thou
[1:43:48] Art the Christ
[1:43:49] um
[1:43:57] the kingdom of God was taken by Peter
[1:44:02] and then there were other kids that were
[1:44:05] remaining things
[1:44:09] the book of Hebrews chapter 2 says
[1:44:13] there were people that were afraid of
[1:44:16] death
[1:44:22] for the slave of death
[1:44:25] so what he did went to hell wire is in
[1:44:31] the book of Peter and what Inigo
[1:44:35] chapter 3 I think it's verse 19 first
[1:44:37] Peter Martin
[1:44:39] so he took the keys
[1:44:44] there was Paradise and high days
[1:44:50] the people in The Paradise
[1:44:53] communicate with the people tonight
[1:44:57] those in Hades were in tormented
[1:45:03] those in Paradise they were relaxed
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:08] waiting for them
[1:45:11] and the Bible says we who are alive
[1:45:20] we are waiting for them
[1:45:23] let me tell you then then he took the
[1:45:27] keys
[1:45:28] then he went to paradise
[1:45:31] and move them out of paradise
[1:45:35] not easy and took them under the altar
[1:45:39] I thought we should know about
[1:45:41] Dimensions
[1:45:43] we are living here on Earth
[1:45:47] it's the athlete Dimension it is which
[1:45:51] is full of atomic bombs
[1:45:54] full of science
[1:45:56] but when you die
[1:45:59] you go to another Dimensions
[1:46:04] let me finish my story
[1:46:06] now he took them out of Paradise
[1:46:11] The Paradise Paradise was a
[1:46:14] communication with with with with high
[1:46:17] days but
[1:46:20] now there's no more Paradise
[1:46:24] because she took them out of paradise
[1:46:27] they are under the altar Banger
[1:46:31] on the sixth dimensions
[1:46:34] and then when you die um not knowing god
[1:46:38] go to the fifth dimensions
[1:46:42] that's where the devil is
[1:46:50] so when you live here on Earth
[1:46:54] no when you we are still living here on
[1:46:57] Earth
[1:46:58] you got an inspiration
[1:47:01] that comes from heaven
[1:47:03] or inspiration
[1:47:08] as we live here on Earth
[1:47:11] we are different people
[1:47:19] some worship Him indirectly
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:24] are we together so now when you die um
[1:47:27] you take your your line
[1:47:32] that is what we call it Dimensions my
[1:47:54] mind you kumbola everything was hidden
[1:47:58] young that is why here he says
[1:48:02] he says to them
[1:48:05] you will wish and his officer to see
[1:48:09] this day
[1:48:11] in other words you wish to see God in
[1:48:14] flesh
[1:48:18] and God descended from eternity
[1:48:22] came here on Earth
[1:48:25] is now in a human being
[1:48:28] I'm not confusing you God
[1:48:33] um
[1:48:35] the form of the revealed way yes
[1:48:58] [Applause]
[1:49:12] his word
[1:49:14] tonight
[1:49:34] when the time comes oh my God
[1:49:39] his soul um
[1:49:46] are we together his spirit will be in
[1:49:50] quotes
[1:50:02] anyway whether you died or whether
[1:50:05] normal drip will be normal even if you
[1:50:08] were eaten by direct
[1:50:11] yourself
[1:50:18] are we together so you will resurrect
[1:50:22] and we will see them that's what the
[1:50:25] Bible says
[1:50:29] we also change together
[1:50:33] what is going to make our bodies change
[1:50:42] remember as as I said the word is with
[1:50:47] God in you
[1:50:49] it's a potential God
[1:50:53] somebody said to me now you say God is
[1:50:57] in a man
[1:50:58] but the Bible says God will come from
[1:51:02] foreign
[1:51:34] you want bread
[1:51:37] and I gave I give you 50 rounds
[1:51:40] 50 Rand to go and buy bread
[1:51:44] potentially you have bread
[1:51:47] nothing I should do that so you say you
[1:51:49] can start singing and say I have
[1:51:51] pressure
[1:51:56] now the revealed weight is
[1:52:00] potentially the presence of God in a
[1:52:03] human ear
[1:52:07] are all together I mean that is the
[1:52:09] promise
[1:52:10] I just says you will desire
[1:52:14] to see
[1:52:17] God in a man
[1:52:19] they were with God
[1:52:22] then he said to them
[1:52:24] you will desire to see the son of man
[1:52:29] but you will not
[1:52:32] because you'll be living in another time
[1:52:36] now in this time
[1:52:40] Musa
[1:52:58] he was mediating he was saying I have
[1:53:01] died for them
[1:53:06] are my children
[1:53:08] he was mediating
[1:53:11] from the beginning of the first stage
[1:53:15] do you know that now we are zutimanji in
[1:53:19] which church age are we living in ABIA
[1:53:21] in any case let's leave it like that
[1:53:24] so what immediated
[1:53:30] his blood was washing us
[1:53:37] get into any parts that has got blood
[1:53:43] no this is how he watched us
[1:53:47] uh
[1:53:49] the word easy
[1:53:52] there was a time when Mary I'll call
[1:53:55] this katila Maria Merchant angels
[1:53:58] to me please make me away
[1:54:06] there was a time
[1:54:07] when Mary met an Angel
[1:54:10] um
[1:54:11] and then the angel said to him
[1:54:16] uh
[1:54:18] you are going to conceive us
[1:54:24] and Mary said I don't know any man
[1:54:28] um
[1:54:30] the angel said in English
[1:54:38] for God like he did to to to to Sarah
[1:54:42] but let me leave that one so Mary said
[1:54:44] okay fine let it be according to your
[1:54:46] weight um
[1:54:54] now the angel of the Lord
[1:55:00] is
[1:55:15] now the blood of that son
[1:55:18] was the blood of God
[1:55:21] now in explaining that is
[1:55:31] has got life in itself
[1:55:35] you know yourself
[1:55:38] if we have the parts of our body
[1:55:42] um
[1:55:43] if you break them down they become
[1:55:46] tissues
[1:55:47] um
[1:55:54] and those tissues become cell if you
[1:55:57] break them down
[1:56:02] those cells become gem cells
[1:56:07] those gem cells
[1:56:11] which have got life in itself
[1:56:15] there's a spirit in the gem cells
[1:56:20] when you've got cancer
[1:56:23] um
[1:56:24] what happened is this
[1:56:28] that
[1:56:30] attacks the spirit of your gems
[1:56:37] and once it's destroyed that it goes to
[1:56:40] the to the cells
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:46] until it destroys the whole part of the
[1:56:49] body is
[1:56:52] now the doctors
[1:56:56] they could detect
[1:56:59] but they don't know that is
[1:57:02] [Music]
[1:57:04] cancer
[1:57:05] they tried to burn
[1:57:08] a demon
[1:57:10] a demon you cast it out in the name of
[1:57:13] it
[1:57:16] are we together that's why they say when
[1:57:19] you've got cancer uh
[1:58:23] life in itself in
[1:58:27] so that's the one now when he says he
[1:58:32] has redeemed us he was a mediator
[1:58:35] he stood for us
[1:58:38] are we together amen and then after that
[1:58:42] then that is the end now that's why
[1:58:45] that's why now he became the Son of God
[1:58:47] says
[1:58:52] uh
[1:58:53] uh to to the Lord Jesus Christ son of
[1:58:56] David Allah
[1:59:08] says
[1:59:19] now when you you you you administer to
[1:59:22] him
[1:59:24] and when you speak to him
[1:59:27] you must address him accordingly
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:34] now when in the time that you are living
[1:59:38] he is now the son of man
[1:59:41] [Music]
[1:59:42] when he was with the disciples
[1:59:45] he was the son of man
[1:59:48] then he said to them
[1:59:51] foreign
[2:00:33] [Music]
[2:00:35] you must know that now he is now in you
[2:00:38] through it's a promise
[2:00:43] now if you don't know the promise of the
[2:00:46] time um
[2:00:48] it says it will be exactly like it was
[2:00:54] in the days of nowhere
[2:00:57] go and check the days of Noah and check
[2:01:03] the time that you are living
[2:01:05] those spirits that were in in the time
[2:01:08] of nowhere
