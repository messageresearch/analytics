[0:11] [music]
[0:32] Amen. Let me read.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; You shall know the truth and the truth
[0:35] shall make you free. They answered him.
[0:39] We are Abraham city are never in bondage
[0:43] to any man.
[0:45] Why?
[0:47] Why do you say
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus said
[0:50] h this means that
[0:53] &gt;&gt; you are servant of sin.
[0:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; They believe the words
[1:01] but disbelieve the word.
[1:06] If the son therefore shall make you
[1:08] free, you shall be free indeed.
[1:15] I know that you are Abraham seed,
[1:19] but you want to kill me.
[1:22] What type of Abraham seed are you?
[1:25] Because my word
[1:29] not my words
[1:31] has no place in you.
[1:36] Amen.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; Now if you are spiritual the Bible says
[1:42] and
[1:45] e as he spoke these words
[1:48] many believed him.
[1:53] So
[1:57] we would put their names down and say
[1:58] these are the ones who believe today.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But many believe many.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[2:09] put their name down. What's your name?
[2:11] &gt;&gt; Welcome in the house of the Lord.
[2:18] And later come around.
[2:22] Now they have to throw away that book
[2:23] &gt;&gt; because the same people who believed
[2:27] &gt;&gt; are now against
[2:31] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:32] So
[2:34] &gt;&gt; it started
[2:35] &gt;&gt; but amen. Amen.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; They would say amen.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; No, we we believe. Amen. Amen. Then the
[2:41] Bible says that he turned to them. Oh
[2:44] God bless you believers. So now you see
[2:48] um now he continued
[2:51] he continued
[2:53] now
[2:55] &gt;&gt; you believers now
[2:57] if you continue
[3:01] if you continue
[3:04] &gt;&gt; in my
[3:07] wedding
[3:09] that that's the the problem is just
[3:11] there.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. They are meaning that
[3:17] we believe God but we don't believe him.
[3:22] Amen. Amen.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; Now the thing comes when he says if you
[3:28] continue
[3:30] in my
[3:32] he doesn't say in God's will
[3:35] in my
[3:38] Amen. That's why God said to the
[3:41] prophet,
[3:43] "Make them to believe you."
[3:47] Why? Because the word is given to you.
[3:52] It's in you.
[3:55] Amen.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; Moses,
[3:58] don't speak to me.
[4:01] Speak to THESE PEOPLE.
[4:04] AMEN.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; The the word is with you.
[4:08] Amen.
[4:11] that that's when the people would say
[4:14] &gt;&gt; where Moses
[4:15] &gt;&gt; you and your God
[4:18] &gt;&gt; you brought us here to die.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; Every time
[4:24] man is involved or God comes as a man,
[4:31] it's just a troubles.
[4:35] I'm going to show you there's trouble in
[4:38] the message so-called message believers
[4:41] today.
[4:44] They believed the words but they don't
[4:48] believe the word
[4:56] &gt;&gt; the Facebook church can start working
[4:59] now right now
[5:02] and help the people out there.
[5:06] Now listen here now.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; Okay, we can stay here the whole day.
[5:11] Let me pass.
[5:15] I know that you are Abraham seed.
[5:18] But you seek to kill me
[5:22] because my word
[5:26] has no place in you.
[5:30] Amen. I speak that which I have seen
[5:33] with my father
[5:37] and you do that which you have seen with
[5:40] your father.
[5:45] Amen.
[5:48] Amen.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; Now each has a father.
[5:57] &gt;&gt; Let me leave this area.
[5:59] I know you are Abraham's seat,
[6:02] &gt;&gt; but now
[6:04] &gt;&gt; you've got a father.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; Now listen, I must stay identified where
[6:14] the word of God is being manifested.
[6:22] I'm back. The mighty God unveiled.
[6:25] God unveiled. You know
[6:28] &gt;&gt; you must stay identified.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; You must identify yourself
[6:37] &gt;&gt; whether you are this or you are not
[6:39] this.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because you can worship two gods.
[6:46] And if you come to God, the Bible says
[6:50] you must believe
[6:53] and come to God. Hallelujah.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; You must believe and come to God.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; Because your belief
[7:07] begs
[7:08] faith.
[7:12] Amen. No, no, no. Fa faith is
[7:15] revelation.
[7:18] By faith, Abraham looked for a city.
[7:23] Amen. Amen.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; So
[7:27] that's why he met Melkisedc
[7:30] because it was by the six sense.
[7:35] So he he went beyond five senses
[7:39] and met Melkisedc
[7:42] because through five senses you don't
[7:45] see Melkisedc
[7:47] you can't reach him.
[7:50] That is five senses.
[7:55] The rest could not see the promised land
[8:00] save Caleb and Joshua.
[8:04] They couldn't see it. They believed the
[8:07] words
[8:10] and they come to
[8:12] Caldisak.
[8:16] They couldn't go over that.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; All right.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:23] I'm identified with the group that knows
[8:26] his unveiled.
[8:33] Amen. Amen.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; So I can read on and on
[8:37] but you must be identified
[8:41] with something.
[8:43] Now let's let's look at this.
[8:46] Now when he says at that day
[8:50] &gt;&gt; you shall know that
[8:53] now you shall know.
[8:55] &gt;&gt; Now I know you you know
[8:59] &gt;&gt; you shall know that I am in you.
[9:06] It never said you shall read that I am
[9:08] in you.
[9:10] Now this is personal.
[9:13] You know
[9:16] Amen.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; And if I know
[9:19] then no man can tell me the truth
[9:23] because I know
[9:26] you know
[9:29] &gt;&gt; and you should know who you are.
[9:36] God's prophet says
[9:38] you should know. Have you read that book
[9:41] perfect faith?
[9:44] He says you should believe
[9:48] what the word says you are.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; If the word says we are Christ, I'm
[9:56] coming to that.
[9:58] If the word says we are Christ, then we
[10:01] are Christ.
[10:03] Amen. Amen.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Because
[10:07] where's that thing? Uh where's my
[10:10] pointer here?
[10:13] My finger won't work here.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you need light.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; Now, here we are
[10:24] being identified with Christ.
[10:27] I'm I'm going to read it. Now, this is
[10:31] the photo that caused problems.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; This one.
[10:39] And this is the same thing that caused
[10:41] problems for Jesus.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; I and God are one.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; He is no longer preaching.
[11:00] He makes himself one with God.
[11:04] You see,
[11:05] they want God
[11:08] to to be a man to be a man
[11:13] &gt;&gt; who is protected
[11:16] that nobody gets near. Amen.
[11:26] Amen.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. But
[11:29] you know people were blocked from
[11:34] but Jesus that's not how how we were
[11:43] not fool you jump in also.
[11:46] [cheering]
[11:49] Amen. Amen.
[11:53] Even
[11:55] a woman could come.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; You know the women those days did not
[12:02] have these hair.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; I mean the ones who walked with Jesus.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the Jezebels of that day.
[12:13] This woman came and wiped his feet with
[12:15] with with her hair.
[12:21] We're still going to talk about those
[12:23] things. Amen.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; And I want to see a sister who can stand
[12:31] here and wipe Jesus feet.
[12:38] How about this one, sister?
[12:49] Do you think you know your hair wouldn't
[12:51] be messed up if you did that?
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Can you wipe Can you wipe his feet?
[13:03] Who can who can wipe his feet?
[13:09] Don't think
[13:15] salon was expensive.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[13:27] right.
[13:33] Oh, I didn't write it here. Christ.
[13:36] Yeah. Well, Christ is the mystery of God
[13:39] revealed.
[13:41] What we are trying to say here
[13:44] is that
[13:46] let's hear first
[13:50] &gt;&gt; that God
[13:51] &gt;&gt; what does he say
[13:54] &gt;&gt; about you?
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; So that you can be able to identify
[14:01] yourself.
[14:03] First thing,
[14:06] let us make men
[14:08] in our image.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; Then
[14:16] as I continue reading
[14:19] and but who was he speaking to?
[14:25] He say he speaking to the son.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; Good.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[14:31] When was the son born?
[14:34] &gt;&gt; In Bethlehem.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; If you say he was speaking to the son,
[14:41] &gt;&gt; it was not Jesus.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Because
[14:47] it says
[14:48] &gt;&gt; the son
[14:50] &gt;&gt; who came out of the logos.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; No, the son was the logos.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; And out of the logos
[15:03] &gt;&gt; came forth
[15:05] &gt;&gt; the man.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; Now, if you look at Jesus, he's both go
[15:12] God and men.
[15:15] Amen.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says,
[15:19] "No man knows the day and the hour."
[15:24] &gt;&gt; Even the son.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the son
[15:31] comes in a twofold
[15:35] one part Jesus
[15:38] Jesus is time
[15:41] where is it eh
[15:45] we don't have the full picture but I
[15:47] I'll say to it here is is the word now
[15:52] &gt;&gt; there you have twofold things there
[15:56] is an ordinary man that was born
[16:00] And another man
[16:03] was the word made flesh.
[16:07] Now the word made flesh
[16:10] is not a man that was born
[16:14] or the man who started by birth.
[16:20] Because the Bible says
[16:23] he that is born of God,
[16:28] &gt;&gt; born of
[16:32] so God GAVE BIRTH
[16:35] and the Bible says again a man that is
[16:38] born of woman.
[16:44] And that's why now
[16:46] &gt;&gt; we have those who were born,
[16:49] &gt;&gt; the Bible says they were born not of the
[16:52] will of flesh and blood.
[16:57] Amen. So these people is the word made
[17:03] flesh.
[17:06] Amen.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Is not an ordinary man.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; Is the word made flesh.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Born not of the will of flesh and blood.
[17:24] Amen.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; That's why now we are here together.
[17:28] Some people can live a holy life here
[17:33] and some can't. Although they hear the
[17:36] word but it is impossible
[17:40] for them to live a godly life. Why they
[17:46] were born of the will of men and women.
[17:52] Amen. But those who who those
[17:56] who were born of God, they are the word
[18:00] made flesh.
[18:04] Amen. And now that's why the Bible says
[18:08] no man knows the day
[18:12] a man born of the will of flesh and
[18:14] blood.
[18:18] Now the prophet says
[18:21] even Jesus
[18:24] did not know. The Bible says even the
[18:27] son don't know.
[18:29] Now the son is twofold.
[18:33] One part is time.
[18:36] You don't know the day and then
[18:41] that is time.
[18:45] So time don't know when he will come.
[18:50] That is that is time.
[18:53] So that's why he says even the son don't
[18:55] know.
[18:59] It's referring
[19:01] to the natural son.
[19:06] Because Jesus came up to where he was a
[19:10] mediator
[19:13] after the resurrection,
[19:15] he became a mediator.
[19:19] But when he took the book,
[19:22] he came down
[19:24] and we we don't see him
[19:27] anymore because
[19:29] h Jesus went back to where he was.
[19:36] Now where he was is light.
[19:41] Amen. That's why the Bible says walk in
[19:44] the light
[19:46] as he is in the light.
[19:50] Amen.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Now I will read you the Bible here.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; You see, now he went back where he was
[20:00] &gt;&gt; and Christ
[20:02] &gt;&gt; the anointing
[20:04] &gt;&gt; came to men.
[20:07] Amen. Amen.
[20:09] Because
[20:11] as he says
[20:13] the last church age,
[20:16] if any man hear my voice
[20:20] and open the door,
[20:22] &gt;&gt; I will come into him.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Now he can only come into him
[20:31] as Christ.
[20:34] Amen.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:39] Can I go into him like this?
[20:43] No.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; But something in me
[20:48] CAN GO IN.
[20:51] AMEN.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Not this body.
[20:54] Amen. Amen.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah. Let's go back here.
[21:04] 14. Let me go back to John 14 a while.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's let's look at John 14
[21:11] &gt;&gt; now.
[21:14] Let's listen here a bit.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; John 14 chapter 20 says at that day 14
[21:22] &gt;&gt; you shall know that
[21:24] I am in the father.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Now the father was this rainbow.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; The spirit.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; That was the spirit.
[21:35] And here
[21:37] &gt;&gt; he made man
[21:39] in his own image
[21:42] from be men from being an attribute.
[21:48] So attributed to a spirit form
[21:53] and then now there he says
[21:58] let us make men
[22:01] in our image. Now the the the word says
[22:06] God was speaking to
[22:09] his subjects
[22:13] because the word Christ
[22:17] where is it?
[22:18] &gt;&gt; No here. Yeah. Here is the logos.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Now the logos.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; That is Christ. That is the word.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; And the word was God.
[22:32] So God's picture says the seven colors
[22:36] of the rainbow.
[22:39] Amen. Amen.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; And he wanted to pose.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "Let us make men
[22:48] in our own image."
[22:52] Amen. Hallelujah. Can
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Can you take that?
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Saw that
[23:01] this morning.
[23:02] I can say
[23:04] &gt;&gt; I'm in the image of God.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Last time
[23:19] there is a brother here.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; He met a sister saying, "Hey, I
[23:23] understand these days.
[23:31] that the TABERNACLE IS FULL OF PICTURES.
[23:33] THERE'S NOT A SINGLE PICTURE OF BROTHER.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; The brother is writing.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; Now brother, now brother.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; The brother said to
[23:43] &gt;&gt; why don't you come
[23:47] to
[23:50] come and see them? Is it like that
[23:57] &gt;&gt; that there's no more picture of brother?
[24:01] You know the Bible says
[24:04] there are people who lie.
[24:10] There are those who make lies.
[24:15] Amen. Amen. Know some just speak lies
[24:21] &gt;&gt; but others
[24:23] &gt;&gt; they make lies
[24:28] they bake life in an oven
[24:42] INSTEAD OF WALKING WITH A liar
[24:45] is better for him to be with a drunker.
[24:48] Amen. Amen.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; If you want a person who is an
[24:54] unbeliever to speak the truth,
[24:58] just give him two bottles of beer.
[25:01] Amen.
[25:06] And [clears throat] then by the way,
[25:11] I'm going to tell you, you don't need
[25:18] You know,
[25:22] I know nothing. [laughter]
[25:29] I don't want to go there and there.
[25:34] Okay.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Let us make men in our image.
[25:42] Amen.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; And John 6 verse44
[25:45] 6:44
[25:47] you know that scripture
[25:49] &gt;&gt; before
[25:51] we close let me read for you and we I
[25:55] said we are going to pose for a photo
[26:05] &gt;&gt; because
[26:07] if I take a picture with Christ
[26:10] &gt;&gt; why don't you take yours with
[26:16] Hallelujah.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; If Jesus cameus,
[26:22] &gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY AND I GO TO JESUS.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Let me pose for a photo with you
[26:28] afterwards.
[26:31] Now you come and question me.
[26:35] NOW LOOK AT HIM. NOW HE EVEN HAS A
[26:37] PICTURE.
[26:39] Why don't you take yours?
[26:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; John 6 verse 44.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; No man can come to me except the the
[26:54] father who has sent me draw him.
[27:03] Still going to talk about
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus says I am from my father.
[27:09] So that no man can come to me
[27:13] &gt;&gt; except
[27:15] he also has come from the father
[27:20] because the prophet says men and god
[27:25] came from the same place
[27:29] that that is the word
[27:33] &gt;&gt; God himself said
[27:36] let us make man
[27:39] in our own image.
[27:42] So man and God came from the same place.
[27:48] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; And that's why countdown says
[27:55] &gt;&gt; uh God is a man.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; God is
[28:05] &gt;&gt; amen.
[28:08] Amen.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; For him to be known better to humans,
[28:14] &gt;&gt; he ps
[28:19] with Peter, John and
[28:23] Amen.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; God,
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. and men
[28:34] together standing together
[28:39] &gt;&gt; we have those pictures in the Bible
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus with his disciples. Amen. Amen.
[28:47] Amen. Now
[28:50] if I brought that picture
[28:54] look
[29:03] there is no revelation there's nothing
[29:04] you can do.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Oh right.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Why? It is because in those days
[29:16] God didn't speak to thees
[29:21] &gt;&gt; he would speak in Jesus
[29:25] and whilst they looking up
[29:34] AND BEING UPON BUT JESUS GOD WAS HERE ON
[29:37] THEM.
[29:41] So if you look up for a long time, you
[29:43] get a bit
[29:49] brought back.
[29:52] They say don't make yourself God.
[29:55] [laughter]
[29:57] &gt;&gt; I agree with you.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Because
[30:02] &gt;&gt; the word says
[30:03] &gt;&gt; the word was made flesh
[30:08] and we saw his glory, his glory
[30:13] and dwell among us.
[30:19] GOD WANTED TO TAKE HIMSELF A PICTURE
[30:21] WITH THE PEOPLE.
[30:23] dwelt among us.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; God with us.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; GOD WITH US.
[30:39] AMEN.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; EMMANUEL,
[30:43] &gt;&gt; God with us.
[30:47] You could take a photo with God,
[30:51] &gt;&gt; but he was a man.
