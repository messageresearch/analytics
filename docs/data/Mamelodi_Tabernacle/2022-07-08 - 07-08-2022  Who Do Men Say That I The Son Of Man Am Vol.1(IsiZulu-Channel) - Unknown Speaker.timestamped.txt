[54:34] we want to
[54:36] thank
[54:37] them and we really appreciate what we
[54:39] are doing
[54:42] normally we don't announce it

[54:49] but
[54:50] we want them to know as the board that
[54:52] we appreciate
[54:54] amen can we claim
[55:02] i know brothers that donated instruments
[55:05] in the church
[55:08] laptops
[55:10] keyboards and many other things

[55:31] um
[55:40] we have
[55:41] another special announcement here if
[55:43] they can display
[55:44] the board
[55:46] they said
[55:55] if you allow me to read
[55:57] it says shalom saints as a result of
[56:01] regulation
[56:03] there has been delays in the dedication
[56:06] of houses
[56:07] and cars
[56:09] therefore the pastor has a long
[56:11] list of houses
[56:14] for dedication
[56:16] we the board have noted
[56:20] that visiting each house
[56:23] will be a long process and will prolong
[56:26] the history
[56:28] to fast-pace this process we have
[56:30] suggested that
[56:32] the best approach is for the saints to
[56:35] send the following
[56:37] pictures of the house
[56:40] the house piece
[56:42] that is the picture of the house piece
[56:47] the full name of the house owner
[56:50] the address of the house
[56:52] the picture
[56:54] of the household
[56:56] now all this information will be sent to
[56:58] the pastor
[57:02] so i have displayed the whatsapp number
[57:04] for
[57:05] that
[57:07] so you just send all this
[57:10] and the
[57:18] [Music]

[1:31:33] when jesus came into the coast of

[1:31:38] he asked his disciples saying
[1:31:40] who do men say that i the son of man am
[1:31:44] and they say some say that thou art john
[1:31:47] the baptist
[1:31:48] some elias and others jeremiah's or one
[1:31:52] of the prophets
[1:31:53] he said unto them but who say he that am
[1:31:58] and simon peter answered and said
[1:32:00] thou art the christ the son of the
[1:32:02] living god
[1:32:04] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:32:07] blessed are thou simon but jonah for
[1:32:10] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:32:12] unto me
[1:32:13] but my father which is in heaven
[1:32:16] and i say also unto thee
[1:32:18] that thou art peter and upon this rock i
[1:32:21] will build my church and the gates of
[1:32:24] hell shall not prevail against it
[1:32:27] and i will give unto thee the keys of
[1:32:29] the kingdom of heaven
[1:32:31] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth

[1:33:37] and upon
[1:33:39] this king his disciples and mother that
[1:33:42] he talked with the woman yet no man said
