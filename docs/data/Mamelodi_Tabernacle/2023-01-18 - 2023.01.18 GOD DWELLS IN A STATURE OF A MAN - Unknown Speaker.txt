Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen amen ities all right amen foreign in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who name God bless you my brother all right amen and uh I should continue I also trusted somebody there God has provided someone there amen amen now as for me it has been weeks away from mamelodi accessible I don't even recall how many three or three or what system okay oh hey [Music] um you should be happy that he's full or what okay amen um Malawi um now when we were there at Beachwood it was a big fight that I had to go to malau said no everything is finished the pastors are coming the stadium prepared um down in California has called um that area you just get scared by the trip itself to get to California now they said the service is going to be at a place where brother Branham fished [Music] were trying to see how we can dodge this one brother um please open the scripture from the Philippians okay Felipe chapter uh chapter 2 verse 5. Philippians 2 verse 5. 11 to 11. yeah my Philippe chapter 2 verse 5 to 11. amen is foreign 11. foreign to 23 John 14 22-23 mythology foreign foreign English Philippines John 14 20 to 24. at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judah saith unto him not his carried Lord how is it that will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the well and just answered said unto him if a man loves me he will keep my weight and my father will love him and I will come unto him and make him our Abode with him foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] is a dangerous message you are gay driving now we thank God that in all the things that he has done for us okay um and so um he's a a brother back [Music] since ever he worked for what was it here okay amen and he was still a young man and married amen and so we thank God today God is now being served by The Offspring amen Okay so uh we we I sometimes we think that this is the last message uh from God then we wonder again next time there is another service now the prophet says he spoke of The Last Ship foreign [Music] so um this is keeping our time or it's our timepiece if the church only knew its position amen amen now sometimes we go out or to evangelize and but you draw yet we should know our position amen we we should know who we are where we are where are we going where we came from amen so if they change only knew its position and the Rapture will go I mean so uh what's keeping the Rapture and not to go yeah something in the bride of Christ okay let me read to you what I'm going to speak of the Prophet says now all right let me start by reading this part we are we are just going briefly to talk about something here um I'm glad I believe a brother wise introduced this morning the brother who came and said that I want to serve my God now and I've been away because you know if you are a child of God you can go very far but God will still restore you amen amen so that's why we as the children of God are we judge no man the judge is God if somebody comes I'm sick we don't ask him questions where do you worship there's a mother I don't know if I I don't think she's here she came yesterday I was your brothers and she was the last person to uh our difficult news about it so I said I said you are a pentagon and he said yes and yes and she she prayed for her condition so I pray for him amen amen because in praying for the sick you don't pray for somebody who is with you in the faith only pray for that particular person because he's with you pray for everybody amen amen and a prayer of faith but I'm glad I don't know if this mama that Mama is here but when she left then she she she she turned this way and that way amen so he said God bless you amen amen so there is power in the world says the word of God is your healer amen amen then there was another sister yesterday and I said because we have prayed for so many people with some kind of disease and people don't know the conditions that people were found to be Liam and they are today and there's no witness to that so this day we need to have a witness every time amen amen I saw uh God bless you this is what I'm trying to talk about God dwells in a stature of Amen now let me read it to you because you know before you can worship God you should know who he is and the way he is because see if you don't know where God is you can just bow on your knees anywhere and that's why the Lord Jesus said to the Samaritan you worship but you don't know why because salvation is of the Jews so that means they worship in vain but he said but now the time has come the true worshipers shall worship God worship God in spirit amen amen it says here I am it's a quotation from the stature of a perfect man from the station of the amen now perfect men says as we were taught that Perfection is in three years three is the number of Perfections then in my Hebrew Book I don't have it yet he says life is in the third amen amen then he goes to a book of Genesis chapter one he says chapter I mean that is verse three well he will move verse three uh he speaks of how God coming down separating water from water Darkness finally he reached the dry ground and he said let the Earth bring forth literally and so surely he calls also verse 11. yeah that is verse 11. okay verse 11 years it says let every tree or plant bring forth of its kind simulation amen amen so uh that that's life coming down but let me read this thing because he says [Music] um how he puts it this he puts it this way that the seed was in the Earth but it was not yet cold but it was already there you see amen and it is in your book I don't have it but I will cook it if you read Genesis he speaks of this year and chapter one I'll have you okay just hold on chapter 1 chapter 1 now verse 11 verse 11. he it says and God said let the Earth bring forth vegetations they have wielding seed and fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was song so now the prophet says because the seeds where are were already there was already there it was only waiting the time of its calling amen amen so and but the title I want to give yeah please you write the thing that I'm gonna read okay I will read two things here one says God dwells in the nature in the stature of a man and I have one part also to read to you all right I think it's somewhere here uh all right I've got it here with me yeah here you are God dwells in the stature of amen then this one says that is cod page 30. now if if we can find out what God is we can find what kind of man he has made because the Bible say yes and verse 8 verse 8 and being found in fashion as a man ah a question I know if verse 7 he says but I made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men amen and being found in fashion as a man verse 8 says I don't know okay all right amen and we just trying to leave amen when he starts in the morning he says I lay the carpet he first starts with the porridge breakfast then when he gets to work okay he was found to be in fashioned with us any mood of a man amen amen then more okay I love come down he was a man um God is a man then why repeat see God so therefore surely it proves it when God came down to dwell Among Us she was a man God dwells in the stature of that means when he came down and when he reached us he was a man [Applause] that's why even in the end time we have the seventh angel messages when the seals reached us it was a man amen amen amen when God reached Philip Hamilton then he was a man so now that's why you will realize that many people could not accept or believe him because they had a certain mentality about God [Applause] so when he reached them he was a man okay Amen in this way um and they don't love him when he becomes [Music] they just want him to be a god a god they can worship without even knowing where he is but when he embodied himself then this is amen amen [Music] maybe I guess let me spoil it I was told that even yesterday they didn't want me to come there too the dedicational services they can't stop me okay so let me read you another thing here um yeah I'm I'm on a ghostly but but not a strike not striking amen the people the Jesus was masked to these Greeks so when they come to him he was masks and and they couldn't understand why that they couldn't see him because they came thinking that God would be this or that but only when they arrived there's two demands [Music] this is the unveiling of God page 17. page 17. they come to see God they've seen amen foreign what do they come for see God whatever so disappointed I'm coming see God we imagine and when you got there you find a man amen amen foreign foreign [Applause] they were around him after making that statement and they said listen to him now amen amen I'm the bread from heaven then let me read it for you we are not in a hurry amen is there anyone who's going to uh Victoria so much he just come to church and say uh brothers and sisters our national team is playing today yeah you need our support and our prayers you see amen well there is so he will just read for the sake of reading and say Jesus loved the world we also love the football lines then 15 minutes 15 minutes let us pray the people can get chance to see amen amen then when the Sun goes down the people are sick because after his prayers okay so God bless you now here we are I will read this part that is John chapter six and for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and uh Kia movies verse 41. I'm going to verse 14. the Jews then remembered him because he said I am the bread that came down from heaven he was Healing The Sick they were following him but he declaration now when the Declaration came the Bible says I am from Heaven because he said I am the bread that came down from heaven how is it then that he said I came down from heaven amen amen and Jesus therefore answered and said unto them not among yourself the son who taught us no man can come to me amen amen uh he showed them the distance they've been there around him how she couldn't come to him it is just like if you are in this place physically physically amen amen and yet if you at the end of it all you have failed to come to God you were just here in the vicinity amen amen but you never um now inside of you there is uh it's a body okay the spirit amen amen now you are inside of you there is a way from your mind down to your soul that's how you can travel yeah and now to reach God you've got to travel as the prophet says it comes down the mind when the word of God comes to you and your mind catches but it has to go down to the soul yeah amen amen when it is in the mind it is theology theology you can't go further that's where theology is coming from the most theology that's where denomination is coming the denomination found the word of God stops in the minds then you'll start to think this one I don't understand this one I won't tell you I'll take this one that is in the mind but once it drops [Music] I can read it quickly once it drops in then it's something different okay amen if I don't have it yeah to you amen so now you see these things as we are carrying on reading the prophet speaks of this okay let me maybe it's around here I'll I'll catch it quickly I mean he speaks of these things how is coming down your mind amen okay I will read it let me find the the position or the the page which I don't remember in which page okay are we together all right amen it's a marked page I will find it I think your faith here in this in this book your faith um I won't surrender I'll find it yeah he says and I could preach the word you could accept it and say that's all right I believe that yeah well if that's all the further it ever goes then you'll never get very far with God foreign but if is the feather it can go hello he says you won't go far with God why because it's not just to say I believe it for the way to to be made manifested amen amen by just saying I believe you won't go far with God amen amen like what I said last night if you say I say to you you believe what you meant that there is communion but if you don't partake oh you don't go far with God why because that way it must be manifested we know that is the word of God manifestation is being fulfilled it's manifested amen amen so it's not just to say I believe but is to leave it come that way amen amen then you are with God because God said let there be and there was light so if he say something and you do it so you are you are together with God but if you just believe it yes amen amen so here we are uh it says Siri then you'll never get very far with God it's intellectual Faith that's the reason people doesn't get healed is because they only have an intellectual view of it amen amen God Jesus heals but if it should be made it's energy either it should be manifested amen if you come here and say I'm sick and you believe that Jesus saves now you must come here to accept that healing if you believe that he heals the sick but you must come and manifest amen you know uh one day we I prayed for uh a sister from Soweto she was brought to my house she couldn't walk and told me that she was Bewitched by her until something like that um okay they helped her walked her into my house now I said to her now I'm going to preach for you right to really pray for you if you believe you'll be healed if you can believe because I believe now you also Must Believe amen amen then while I was talking about she asked for the restroom and I I I could see that she was managed to stand up so but the husbands still mindful of such as you come which yes and he he tried to hold hands and I said no just leave here but anyhow he insisted because that team was still here that if he she can try to do it she will drop down so I have to help so I just left them like by the time we finish prayed foreign before I prayed for him already she was healed amen she believed the weight I am I I spoke to him the healer is the word you know yeah sometimes if if a person believes I can say to to him or her if he says hey I'm sick like I did in Cameroon very soon yeah brother was there a sister said sister sister her business is to sell fish fried fish and so foreign where she is doing her business now when she said to me my hand is so so little like a usual I said to her or I just hold my hand I said you are all right it is because I saw the sister that day she believed in me now you listen she didn't believe me as God amen you causing God why God decide to brother Brennan made people to believe amen amen you know and because they come to the prophets uh believing okay amen but now usually God wants them to locate yeah to believe God where he is to believe him from where he is amen amen it will be a better thing as it was a better thing that's the best thing is to become like them foreign amen that we hear from you amen amen you see amen now God was closer to them and okay amen all right but they wanted to overtake and overrun Moses thinking that they will come and stand before God yeah we have come ourselves now because Moses is always coming alone here we are here ourselves they couldn't reach him the only way they could reaches in Moses foreign amen [Applause] [Music] and if you can see who God is then you'll be able to see what kind of man yes okay amen oh let me finish my statement um the reason people can't get healed is because they only have an intellectual what their mind conceives but the mind will reason change it cannot be uh um okay let me go where it you'll understand all right like somebody is prayed foreign Arabella and theory and you say Jesus Christ has healed you know he listens from my mind that hey that pain is still there amen amen so now he will keep that pain in his mind and as long as he's keeping the pain in his mind not happening the pain will remain in his toes [Applause] until he let go and believe what the word has said in July because if there is the word says you are healed it is like Let There be lights I mean amen and so surely now he says now listen this where I was coming and when once that faith comes down into the compartment would you just see amen amen so once it is in the compartment there is the reason people doesn't get where they should be no okay this morning foreign [Applause] [Music] like when someone has a dog on a leash the dog would would like to attack maybe another dog but because it is holding tight on the other side so but it will run but he will pull it Satan does the same thing he can put you only you come and say Jesus Jesus so you can't just reach the place now you remain with a wish but you don't reach it if you're happy amen amen sing the song closer together now it's not just to be close house nor is to reach the place the Bible says he God says he who finds me who finds life and it says seek the Lord and find him instead the people are finding churches [Music] seek the Lord okay amen uh yeah the last thing it says but when once that faith comes down into that compartment is [Music] that means the faith must come in there it's compartment which is not in their mind they seem more popular there will never be a question because their their faith can blossom if you can hold the seed close to the ground be a house it won't geminate you must bury it in the ground amen now if you you you you you have your uh faith and you keep it in the mind [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music]
