[29:58] Revelation chapter
[30:00] 7 chapter
[30:02] 8 verse one 8
[30:09] verse1 Revelation 8

[30:37] amen for the
[30:40] blessings that you have showered us with
[30:45] blessings up to even last
[30:49] night
[30:52] so we are also
[30:56] people the difference is
[30:59] that we were in your mind as
[31:04] attributes before the foundation of the
[31:08] world
[31:10] yes that's
[31:12] why the prophet came and
[31:16] said we have heard from our
[31:24] theophany there's difference when it
[31:26] comes to to
[31:30] hearing we don't hear with this natural
[31:37] ears we come from a far
[31:42] country the mind of
[31:46] God so our
[31:49] hearing as the word
[31:53] says
[31:55] when the brother gave his
[31:59] record he
[32:02] said that which we have
[32:06] heard and we have
[32:08] [Applause]
[32:11] sin this is the ministry
[32:15] oh that which we have
[32:19] heard and that's why my beloved Prophet
[32:24] says you have you from your
[32:30] theop it's not a new thing to
[32:33] us we don't we didn't hear from any
[32:38] man but from the from our theop amen so
[32:43] we are so dread even this morning we
[32:46] come here ready to hear from our theop
[32:51] amen thank you Lord for this word yes
[32:55] Lord that we
[32:58] just about to share among us am in Jesus
[33:02] Christ's name I pray for the blessings
[33:05] upon
[33:07] all those who will hear from their
[33:11] theop as I pray in Jesus name amen amen
[33:16] you may be
[33:18] seated okay we have to
[33:24] read okay
[33:29] uh I'm going back to
[33:34] this
[33:36] uh firstly let me quote to you
[33:42] this the seventh
[33:47] seal Seven Seals seven and this is the
[33:50] seventh
[33:53] seal it says we must remember
[33:58] that this seventh
[34:01] seal is the
[34:04] end of
[34:09] time right
[34:13] amen just there meaning
[34:17] that we are living
[34:22] time as this is the
[34:24] end when time in
[34:30] then what
[34:32] happens then we are going
[34:37] back
[34:39] to Before
[34:46] Time Time put us in this
[34:51] bodies but
[34:53] before we were in the mind of of
[34:58] God as
[35:04] attributes and that's
[35:06] why my Prophet says
[35:11] before it can be a
[35:14] word it is a
[35:18] thought in a
[35:22] mind now what makes you a believer
[35:29] an eternal
[35:32] believer is
[35:35] because before the foundation of the
[35:38] world you were in the mind of
[35:42] God Amen that's the only thing that can
[35:45] make
[35:48] you a
[35:55] real amen amen
[35:59] amen
[36:01] and I was reading something
[36:05] here H I'm going to watch
[36:11] my
[36:17] clock you know brother Brenham brother
[36:21] BR is God's
[36:25] prophet
[36:28] why we know that he is God's
[36:31] Prophet it is because we were
[36:39] together it's not we don't hear from the
[36:42] people that's why brother B says you
[36:49] have now if you have heard
[36:52] already then the message that is coming
[36:55] forth
[36:57] is not from the
[37:03] people the Mind of Men is so
[37:11] shallow that's
[37:13] why even if we come to the
[37:18] service we
[37:20] sit to
[37:24] hear
[37:25] from to hear what we have
[37:31] heard now if we say
[37:33] Amen that is
[37:36] because the
[37:39] utterance is something that we we have
[37:46] he
[37:49] now sometimes men can preach taking off
[37:53] the jacket and jumping down and so
[37:59] but to a predestinated
[38:04] being he doesn't just taken up
[38:08] by
[38:11] such no he has
[38:17] heard that's why the scripture
[38:20] says that which we
[38:25] have
[38:28] amen not last
[38:32] Sunday amen
[38:34] amen and that which we have heard and
[38:39] have
[38:44] SE declare we unto
[38:50] you okay amen
[38:52] meaning if somebody comes with the
[38:55] things that he has is
[39:00] here can you tell that person
[39:07] something he has already H from
[39:16] his now if you
[39:19] preach to such a person you should be
[39:23] preaching from the
[39:25] the
[39:30] and your
[39:32] preaching will will be
[39:36] as it is told in the
[39:44] Bible
[39:46] what we have
[39:49] heard it says from the
[39:54] beginning in the beginning was the
[40:00] way all right amen now if there's
[40:07] somebody who has heard the
[40:12] word from the
[40:15] beginning you can't convince such a
[40:18] person with any
[40:25] word
[40:27] he has already
[40:29] [Music]
[40:32] heard right

[40:38] was the word am all
[40:42] right that's
[40:45] why you see people coming
[40:52] going they
[40:55] cannot keep the
[40:58] word from the
[41:04] beginning some come and take some few
[41:09] notes and

[42:09] notable
[42:15] one the
[42:17] angel okay amen so I read something here

[42:29] seal is the end of
[42:33] time of all
[42:39] things right

[42:48] now I can't start a
[42:51] church I don't have men cannot start a
[42:55] church
[42:59] because he has not that
[43:04] blood for to start a
[43:07] [Music]
[43:11] church it was
[43:13] started by the Holy
[43:16] Blood of
[43:19] God when they looked at that
[43:22] blood they realized that it is it was
[43:26] not human
[43:31] blood they couldn't find human blood in
[43:34] the Lord Jesus
[43:38] Christ the the Bible says we were
[43:42] bought of the blood of
[43:50] God the blood what can the blood of God
[43:54] make you to be
[44:03] all right
[44:04] amen now you as The
[44:10] Offspring uh from
[44:13] God washed in the
[44:17] blood of the
[44:20] Lamb that lamp was not like this lamp
[44:24] you see
[44:34] you
[44:35] know while the people were in
[44:42] sin there was the word of
[44:48] God which
[44:51] came to
[44:54] Jordan there is
[44:56] Jordan there was an
[45:00] eagle a great
[45:05] Eagle brother Bram says it was an
[45:11] eagle on the
[45:18] banks of the
[45:21] [Music]
[45:24] river
[45:26] now this
[45:29] Eagle was
[45:32] there in
[45:34] order to
[45:41] introduce Christ
[45:43] [Music]
[45:45] chist that
[45:49] great his
[45:53] ministry was not for
[45:58] any other
[46:05] thing but was only to
[46:12] introduce the Great
[46:17] Eagle that came
[46:20] there Riv
[46:23] Jordan send
[46:26] to me and
[46:29] you amen that's why we are
[46:37] iglet an eagle can see far
[46:44] away they call it a majestic
[46:50] B and brother bam says for for for an
[46:54] eagle to see
[46:57] better it has to go
[47:05] up if there's something
[47:07] here and the eagle can't see
[47:12] that
[47:13] amen then it goes
[47:17] up the more it goes
[47:19] up the better it can
[47:24] see
[47:29] now you as an
[47:31] e you are just like your
[47:37] father the more you go
[47:39] out the more you can see
[47:45] better
[47:48] Majestic brothers and
[47:53] sisters I now let let us read
[47:58] here now that's why you know it is the
[48:03] time for the Eagles to take their
[48:11] flight the other birs can also
[48:18] fly as far as an eagle
[48:22] [Applause]
[48:24] can
[48:27] because if you go
[48:29] higher you must have the vision of an
[48:38] eagle if you can try to go
[48:41] high you'll be
[48:45] Blended and the
[48:47] eagle was
[48:51] armed amen amen God knowing that
[48:56] it will it will fly
[49:00] high he fitted
[49:03] it with a
[49:06] vision all right
[49:09] amen now when the Seven
[49:13] Seals I mean the seventh
[49:17] seal you watch the
[49:20] seventh that's when the Eagles take
[49:24] off
[49:29] that's why the prophet says even the
[49:34] interpretation was
[49:37] flying
[49:39] amen amen he speaks of the
[49:42] flying
[49:47] interpretation meaning
[49:49] that only the
[49:54] Eagles
[49:57] will understand
[49:59] and
[50:03] receive okay
[50:07] amen the mother
[50:10] Eagle gives birth to a baby
[50:17] eagle okay let's look at this
[50:20] now H I'm going back to this for for few
[50:28] minutes again I read
[50:33] here page
[50:36] 562
[50:38] 562
[50:39] of the seventh
[50:44] seal now you should know that the
[50:51] seventh is the
[50:54] highest
[50:59] that's
[51:01] why it was supposed to be an
[51:06] eagle to introduce that
[51:14] eagle
[51:16] because this Eagle
[51:20] John didn't see him when he was standing
[51:24] there
[51:27] but he followed
[51:30] him until he
[51:34] saw even a spirit
[51:37] coming like
[51:39] a upon
[51:42] him he recognized him when he saw the
[51:50] supernatural not just a
[51:54] preaching amen amen you know there's
[51:57] been there have been
[52:00] preachings after
[52:02] preachings but man is getting
[52:08] nowhere because your preaching should be
[52:13] from
[52:21] above that's why we are reading now
[52:25] about
[52:25] the Eagles
[52:30] food the church ages
[52:35] over did you see how it
[52:38] ended it is
[52:44] over
[52:49] uh we we have
[52:51] reached the
[52:54] height
[53:01] where you can even
[53:04] introduce the
[53:10] VES because it says we have
[53:17] passed the
[53:19] seven Church
[53:21] [Music]
[53:24] AG
[53:28] can we go back
[53:30] there we can now you
[53:33] listen I will I will read
[53:38] here
[53:40] uh you notice
[53:44] now for the End of
[53:47] Time
[53:51] message did you hear that there is the
[53:53] end of time
[54:01] message right
[54:03] amen it is for the
[54:07] people H who came from
[54:13] eternity
[54:16] and they were putting the bodies of
[54:22] time now the seventh
[54:26] seal introduced the End of
[54:33] Time the seventh
[54:36] SE is the End of
[54:40] Time
[54:44] message amen
[54:46] amen now if you go beyond
[54:52] that you enter into
[54:56] something higher than any man's
[55:01] [Music]
[55:02] thoughts
[55:07] amen he says I knew
[55:09] not this
[55:14] SE they've been revealed this
[55:18] week that
[55:21] week and he speaks he says
[55:28] uh did anybody think of
[55:31] that of those seven
[55:34] angels being this
[55:37] being the
[55:39] message that was coming
[55:43] forth it was introduced to
[55:46] him of the message that was coming
[55:51] forth the message after the message
[55:57] I believe now the bride of
[55:59] Christ the message after the
[56:14] message I can't leave should you take me
[56:17] back there I can't leave
[56:22] there
[56:23] amen

[56:29] this you know that's why uh I've been
[56:33] listening to many
[56:35] things
[56:40] saying amen
[56:42] amen
[56:44] now they are talking to
[56:52] themselves when the Lord Jesus was
[56:55] working here on
[57:00] Earth he was
[57:03] mocked he was
[57:05] called King of
[57:07] the
[57:09] Demons amen amen
[57:13] amen when I heard somebody calling
[57:21] me when I he that that doesn't make me
[57:31] angry so they said to the Lord Jesus
[57:34] Christ
[57:41] you he didn't anger the
[57:46] Lord because what do you expect from the
[57:49] opp
[57:53] Opposite
[57:58] all right amen and the Lord just carried
[58:07] on all right am if he was called King of
[58:11] the
[58:13] Demons What more
[58:20] about calling the
[58:23] Creator King of the
[58:26] demon what do you
[58:29] expect if you believe
[58:35] him now let's
[58:38] here now it says I read this
[58:42] part
[58:44] uh see the Angels
[58:51] coming because the whole message
[58:56] has
[59:00] changed it's now after
[59:05] this church ages Church you know it's
[59:09] time
[59:13] ages
[59:15] then what is beyond
[59:23] timeing
[59:25] that if he
[59:27] says he speaks about the end of the
[59:30] church
[59:32] ages then what's
[59:37] next eternity that's where even angels
[59:41] are introduced and so
[59:46] for that's ET now let me read to you
[59:52] something
[59:53] here
[59:56] uh remember the seventh
[1:00:00] messenger the seventh
[1:00:04] messenger then he says the noted
[1:00:10] one to me the seventh
[1:00:18] angel yeah the noted
[1:00:21] one is the one you are looking at
[1:00:25] that one is
[1:00:28] noted among the other
[1:00:35] Angels you know if
[1:00:38] we we were in
[1:00:41] Mal at a certain
[1:00:45] place I remember I can't remember the
[1:00:48] name of the
[1:00:50] place but a a man w
[1:00:56] we were at the at the
[1:01:01] lake he he he introduced to us the
[1:01:08] Eagles
[1:01:09] now while we were standing
[1:01:15] there he said to us I want I'm going to
[1:01:19] feed the
[1:01:20] Eagles now we wonder this man how is he
[1:01:25] going to feed
[1:01:28] the and they had pieces of
[1:01:36] Flesh myself I don't know about
[1:01:40] others I was
[1:01:43] wondering this man is going to feed the
[1:01:47] eag where are
[1:01:49] they there was
[1:01:52] no but he says I want to show
[1:01:55] you feed the
[1:01:58] [Music]
[1:02:00] Eagles while I was watching
[1:02:05] you and then he started to do
[1:02:10] this
[1:02:13] H he called to this
[1:02:17] Eagles in a certain
[1:02:21] way amen amen and uh who are
[1:02:31] they yes yes the brother was there
[1:02:35] brother
[1:02:37] mang was that
[1:02:39] mangi yeah the place is called
[1:02:45] mangi you know what he did he has a
[1:02:49] piece of
[1:02:52] Flesh and he
[1:02:55] throw that into the
[1:02:57] air but before that he made a certain
[1:03:04] sound I think no no other
[1:03:08] B could answer to
[1:03:11] that because it was just for the
[1:03:20] Eagles God knows how to bring the Eagles
[1:03:23] together amen
[1:03:30] it will be a unique am
[1:03:34] [Music]
[1:03:37] Ministry so
[1:03:39] now when he made that
[1:03:45] sound then I'm I'm looking at him
[1:03:48] because there's no
[1:03:51] eag then he
[1:03:55] he took one piece
[1:03:59] of threw
[1:04:03] it but when he did that an eagle came
[1:04:08] from
[1:04:10] there from a
[1:04:13] tree we didn't know
[1:04:18] that but that piece of
[1:04:23] Flesh
[1:04:26] an
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:30] eag amen
[1:04:34] am then I
[1:04:38] was there was no
[1:04:45] sign amen amen but that
[1:04:50] peace what the Eagles feed on
[1:04:59] and we didn't
[1:05:01] know
[1:05:03] that in this seven Church ages
[1:05:08] Church there some special
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:16] people you
[1:05:17] know eag don't eat like other
[1:05:23] beds
[1:05:26] when I look at that I realize that no
[1:05:29] other bed is coming only an
[1:05:36] eag because it is special
[1:05:41] food for the
[1:05:45] eag it will be coming
[1:05:49] from
[1:05:53] at only throws that
[1:05:57] of eag is
[1:06:00] there picks it
[1:06:03] [Music]
[1:06:04] up and fly
[1:06:07] back then the second piece another
[1:06:14] eag is then we
[1:06:17] realize we been among the
[1:06:23] eag
[1:06:27] but something revealed
[1:06:36] them you know it is just like church
[1:06:38] ages Church
[1:06:40] AG there's a
[1:06:43] time
[1:06:45] when the
[1:06:47] Eagles the
[1:06:50] eagle flesh
[1:06:53] or food for the
[1:06:55] Eagles was
[1:07:00] displayed all right amen
[1:07:05] and one special thing about an
[1:07:12] eagle it can
[1:07:14] feed from
[1:07:19] high is that right
[1:07:22] amen all right
[1:07:24] amen then you can see
[1:07:27] also with the church
[1:07:31] ages when the
[1:07:33] time for the
[1:07:36] eagle to be seen
[1:07:41] comes he open the
[1:07:48] seals the seals opened at the time of
[1:07:51] the
[1:07:52] eag
[1:08:00] because some other B will never even
[1:08:07] understand and I realize that no other
[1:08:11] bed was attracted by that piece of
[1:08:17] meat the eagle
[1:08:22] Asing all right amen
[1:08:26] now that's why even
[1:08:31] today I know
[1:08:34] that for to call an
[1:08:39] eagle I must bring a
[1:08:50] special I can call call for prayer
[1:08:52] allance and so for Jesus
[1:08:57] is for the
[1:09:02] E it should be
[1:09:07] [Music]
[1:09:09] special all right amen because it can
[1:09:15] fly a majestic
[1:09:19] bed loved the eag so
[1:09:22] much
[1:09:26] that's why he likened
[1:09:28] John
[1:09:32] to walking on
[1:09:36] the
[1:09:39] watching and when that great
[1:09:44] Eagle landed
[1:09:46] there John look at
[1:09:51] it amen amen am and he saw
[1:09:57] it then he said
[1:10:00] beh
[1:10:03] behold the lamp of
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:08] God who else could see
[1:10:13] him but it was an
[1:10:19] eagle now the real message closing now
[1:10:26] of the
[1:10:31] eag you know the more you go
[1:10:35] higher the
[1:10:37] more the
[1:10:41] Revelation you receive

[1:10:49] up by the
[1:10:51] Revelation amen

[1:10:58] eagle is not
[1:11:04] Evangelistic an Eagle When it comes it
[1:11:08] won't introdu to you just the
[1:11:13] gospel but it comes from
[1:11:16] above it will introduce to

[1:11:22] highest
[1:11:25] [Music]
[1:11:28] like we are going
[1:11:30] to we'll follow this things and
[1:11:36] introduce
[1:11:37] the noble
[1:11:42] [Music]
[1:11:46] one you don't
[1:11:48] hear any men
[1:11:51] say the noble one

[1:12:00] one okay God bless you my brother now
[1:12:04] let's let's close with
[1:12:06] this uh we will still carry on
[1:12:12] as okay I will reach this
[1:12:18] part uh this is something I started with
[1:12:22] saying I I knew not the
[1:12:27] seals but how they were
[1:12:31] introduced when he did not
[1:12:35] know and he
[1:12:38] says seven
[1:12:41] angels you know from seven
[1:12:44] churches he didn't know but then came
[1:12:48] seven
[1:12:51] angels not seven churches
[1:12:54] Church seven
[1:12:58] angels amen
[1:13:00] amen you know we were talking
[1:13:04] about you must sa
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:13] love because it was all types of
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:22] beds but when the time of the Eagles
[1:13:28] come you can't even say love one
[1:13:33] another because that is their nature to
[1:13:36] love one
[1:13:44] another you can't preach to the Eagles
[1:13:47] about the Love of
[1:13:51] [Music]
[1:13:52] Money
[1:13:56] if I preach to
[1:13:57] you the love of
[1:14:03] M I'm
[1:14:10] evangelizing
[1:14:12] uh somebody bought
[1:14:15] a a car that can go
[1:14:21] fast he knows it why use that this
[1:14:25] car once he start

[1:14:44] no the speed is in that
[1:14:50] [Applause]
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:14:52] car
[1:14:54] that's why I'm
[1:14:57] saying talk to the
[1:15:02] Eagles it is when like when
[1:15:06] God if you can find God talking to The
[1:15:17] Offspring I've seen many a
[1:15:20] time a mama trying to teach a child to
[1:15:27] speak but what puzzled
[1:15:32] me you just
[1:15:41] hear
[1:15:44] amen he's not
[1:15:49] saying you ask him why what are you
[1:15:51] doing he says I'm teaching him
[1:15:53] te to speak now I end up not knowing
[1:15:57] who's
[1:16:05] teaching because he
[1:16:11] says okay
[1:16:15] amen all right
[1:16:18] amen I don't
[1:16:22] believe
[1:16:29] Elijah God taught
[1:16:33] Elijah
[1:16:37] no it was
[1:16:41] Elijah if God creates an
[1:16:45] eagle he will put the engine of
[1:16:52] eagle
[1:16:56] amen so each and every
[1:17:00] being as a kind of
[1:17:07] Angel like right
[1:17:11] now
[1:17:14] uh the
[1:17:16] gospel if I sit down to
[1:17:19] listen and you will come you say
[1:17:24] repent repent and be
[1:17:29] baptized you you would not be talking to
[1:17:33] me
[1:17:35] amen all right amen now I let me read
[1:17:40] something the last thing
[1:17:41] here we we we are still going on we have

[1:21:08] those amen
[1:21:11] amen now uh what what I'm saying
[1:21:15] now is that we are talking about the
[1:21:19] things we know
[1:21:26] [Music]
[1:21:27] uh wait a
[1:21:31] bit let me leave it for
[1:21:34] next we will find it it is still
[1:21:37] there but for
[1:21:39] now uh let me read this in
[1:21:43] closing okay I will
[1:21:47] turn oh yeah here's the
[1:21:50] book I I just wanted to read this to you
[1:21:54] because we are going to come to
[1:21:56] that the white stone in the pyramid the
[1:22:01] prophet
[1:22:02] said when he the top of the pyramid was
[1:22:08] chopped now he said look inside
[1:22:12] here and when they looked there was a a
[1:22:17] what was
[1:22:19] there white St a white stone
[1:22:23] then he
[1:22:25] went
[1:22:27] where now you'll understand that man was
[1:22:31] placed
[1:22:34] Eastward but if he speaks about the
[1:22:37] Angels speaks about
[1:22:41] West I went West to connect with the
[1:22:46] angels
[1:22:47] message this is what he said and came
[1:22:51] back
[1:22:53] to do
[1:22:59] what
[1:23:01] yeah uh
[1:23:05] listen
[1:23:07] uh the
[1:23:09] third speaks about the
[1:23:12] Angels before I finish up with this guy
[1:23:16] have found the third came from
[1:23:20] the West
[1:23:24] sweeping
[1:23:26] forward with great terrific
[1:23:30] speech and they picked me
[1:23:33] up and that was
[1:23:36] coming
[1:23:40] east amen amen now don't forget this man
[1:23:45] was
[1:23:48] pleased now with the mystery of the
[1:23:50] seven cies
[1:23:56] just like it said in junior Jackson's
[1:24:01] Dre that the Lord let me
[1:24:06] interpret
[1:24:09] there we are going there the Lord
[1:24:14] willing if he doesn't come
[1:24:17] tonight on the inside of that
[1:24:21] pyramid there was white
[1:24:26] stone that were no writing
[1:24:32] on you know there he said
[1:24:36] watch look
[1:24:38] inside and the stone had no
[1:24:43] writing that's the reason I had to go
[1:24:48] west to connect with the Angel's message
[1:24:54] to come back here to reveal it to the
[1:25:02] church all right amen remember I said
[1:25:06] the next thing that will
[1:25:09] happen will be here at the
[1:25:14] church not the
[1:25:17] churches the
[1:25:20] church because
[1:25:23] Prophet when he is
[1:25:26] sent he is sent to a certain
[1:25:29] [Music]
[1:25:33] class you know the opening of The Seven
[1:25:39] SE is for a
[1:25:43] class A Certain class not
[1:25:49] every all right amen then he
[1:25:55] says then he he carries on to talk
[1:26:00] about
[1:26:02] angel very
[1:26:06] notable all right with this one the
[1:26:09] reason I had to go west to connect with
[1:26:12] this Angel's
[1:26:16] message not just a message but the
[1:26:20] Angels message
[1:26:24] to come back here to reveal it to the
[1:26:31] church when he opened the
[1:26:34] book what
[1:26:36] happened he gave the
[1:26:39] book to
[1:26:41] theth Angel
[1:26:46] message okay amen for the
[1:26:50] angel to reveal
[1:26:54] to
[1:26:55] the
[1:26:57] now
[1:26:59] this one is is
[1:27:03] human I mean in figure in
[1:27:07] stature but he's a he says that's an
[1:27:13] angel then he speaks about an
[1:27:18] angel now we'll see when he speaks about
[1:27:23] the angel with the seventh
[1:27:31] seal did you read about that an angel
[1:27:36] with the seventh
[1:27:40] seal all right

[1:27:50] now but
[1:27:53] it is something he says unknown to the
[1:28:01] public because it is open in a
[1:28:09] threefold now you take your

[1:30:55] saying long years
[1:30:58] ago before they had

[1:31:07] of

[1:32:08] it and and turn
[1:32:12] it until the
[1:32:15] bit seeing

[1:32:29] that's how God can deal with his
[1:32:37] son you know God don't treat us like

[1:33:20] Jesus
[1:33:23] was
[1:33:24] beat
[1:33:27] around until God see
[1:33:32] himself then it
[1:33:37] says now
[1:33:39] finally it says when this man was found
[1:33:42] I'm trying to I will reduce it to
[1:33:47] because I know you know what I'm talking
[1:33:49] about when that man was
[1:33:52] hired to to build a
[1:33:56] bridge and it's a true
[1:33:59] story told by the prophet of God finally
[1:34:04] there
[1:34:06] came the first one who
[1:34:09] came I don't know how
[1:34:11] many they couldn't take the
[1:34:14] job when they went down in the sea they
[1:34:19] found that it is send
[1:34:23] then they said no we can't take the job
[1:34:27] because we can't build this
[1:34:28] bridge because it is send
[1:34:33] down now you know what I'm you know
[1:34:37] it now here comes this
[1:34:41] man and it says this one he he's a man
[1:34:45] with a
[1:34:50] reputation okay amen now he
[1:34:54] arrived now it the first thing he
[1:34:58] knew was that they must be
[1:35:06] sent amen amen but knowing that there is
[1:35:11] s he knew about the gospel of these
[1:35:20] others
[1:35:24] gospel it is not
[1:35:27] revealed about it
[1:35:30] there but he knew something beyond the
[1:35:38] S amen amen
[1:35:42] yes he knew
[1:35:44] something the people are talking about
[1:35:46] something about something
[1:35:49] about you there must be
[1:35:52] some people who would
[1:35:54] know that beyond what these people are
[1:36:01] arguing there is a genuine
[1:36:06] [Applause]
[1:36:09] thing you know you don't join the
[1:36:14] choir with the people
[1:36:19] argue but the one who knows that
[1:36:22] Beyond this
[1:36:23] arguments and Beyond the sand there's a
[1:36:33] rock so it's a true story
[1:36:37] story now the last thing is that finally
[1:36:43] that
[1:36:44] man he knew that you know brother Bram
[1:36:48] puts it
[1:36:50] right knew that be
[1:36:54] the must
[1:36:57] be a
[1:37:00] rock that's why he speaks about the rock
[1:37:06] confession each and every
[1:37:08] age had a rock
[1:37:13] confession they must
[1:37:16] reach the rock your
[1:37:19] gospel your gospel
[1:37:22] must reach the
[1:37:25] rock
[1:37:26] am if it can't reach the
[1:37:29] rock then it's not
[1:37:35] genuine now this man he also
[1:37:39] arrived at the
[1:37:41] S but he knew that Beyond
[1:37:46] this there must
[1:37:49] be so he carried on he came to where
[1:37:54] others have
[1:37:57] failed amen then from there he went
[1:38:04] deeper knowing that then must be a
