rage amen and we are going back to this you know we need that's how god wants wants it to be like and following these scriptures leading us to a meeting in the air amen now this is the preparations by through what we call the rapturing faith and as the prophet of god puts it that this third pool will bring about the rapture in faith they are not willing perhaps we will also come to briefly to this third pool what is the deadpool you know how he said to the prophet of god his prophet and you know a hand was a thought was given to him now i don't know if this is only known to me or to everybody here that this sword was at the gate instigated in the hand of the cherubim after adam forfeited the book [Applause] the manual book and so from adam we come to enoch the seventh man now enoch was responsible for the this pyramid structure and now to the seventh angel messenger [Music] amen so now now that sword was given back to mankind [Applause] i don't know that if i am the only person who's witness to that amen i don't know whether you are also partakers of the same mystery of god but what i know is that that sword was given to the seventh angel messenger [Music] amen and we stood there on that mountain sabino canyon kenya where he stood when the sword was dropped into his hand [Applause] amen so i went to cameroon and i narrated these things to them [Music] wooden thing is that is that then i had to prove to the people that it's a fault now for further information you need to meet pastor jewell [Music] in cameroon why he he gave me that sword amen now but the sword was given to the seventh angel messenger [Music] all right now this meaning i just want to read again this part and don't be in a hurry let us take these things like that and we are coming here to the whole volume is the rapture the calling of the bride to a meeting in the air amen and i wonder if this one here who believes that this thing is is going to happen very soon [Applause] [Music] all the signs are there the sign of gog and magog is there [Music] river euphrates is there [Music] they are all just yet before our eyes amen although even in the it was not every person who could see before the flood the sign of noah amen even today you'll see as we follow these things we are going to bring pictures to show that [Music] here is the signs amen even i'm addressing the heavenly congregation here we are we are in parliament now yeah now in parliament you know there is always the ruling party the opposition what else his party this party and that party all right but it is one called the ruling party [Music] so i think we are here as the ruling party [Music] mission of god okay now let's look let's do this i'm going again to say them that are asleep [Music] or do i say they or them anyhow okay and let's bow ahead for the reading of the word our heavenly father we are here again before the almighty god angels being witnesses that we were purchased before the foundation of the world and they when as we know that further our spirits were not created but our spirits were part of god only our bodies were created in order for the spirit to be able to occupy a mask and further we know the time has arrived that this mask will be taken away or we will take off this mask now and put on the immortality so we are so glad even this morning that the lord god is with us here we are here not to fear anything because we are the sons and daughters of the almighty god and satan knows this even this morning how we put him in heaven before the first battle was fought in heaven and there we are witnesses that as the word of god says those who fought him are here to fight him only those who overcome us from heaven will still come he who are still here to overcome and father we are so thankful that we are not practicing and we are not trying to overcome but we came here as overcomers already we are just on our way back home when this great army of god shall be shall go through the perigees back to heaven again that heaven will be here on earth as the word says it came from it will come from heaven to the earth the new heaven and the new earth we are so thankful we here to worship again this morning without fear of anything and lord we are so thankful in jesus christ's name we pray for the word to be the word we are about to partake of we pray that it will be a blessing to us and to everybody a healing to the sick one come further to the brokenhearted so father thank you in jesus christ's name we pray amen and let's go back to this scripture again and say first corinthians chapter 15 verse 51 to 52 god bless you all [Music] be amen in a moment in the treatment of an eye and the last time for the challenge and sound and the death shall be reigned incorruptible and we shall be changed okay for now we may be seated let me start reading to you because we're going to look at this what do you call them now let me read them you know what i'm talking about when we come we remember that we live here in three dimensions and then it goes on to say uh he says i don't know if i can name them or not one of them is light the other is matter and it carries on to say the third atom on and on light matter time and our five senses contact them dimensions our side contacts light our feeling contacts matter but we have contact through science the fourth dimension because coming right through this building now comes pictures [Music] voices of radio pictures on television you know but we can't see them with our eyes [Music] they've got to come through a certain troop [Music] but they are as he says they are just inside of this building amen and then now they come through signs oh now i want you to understand this that's why the thing that's keeping the people so busy today is a cell phone [Music] even even new born babies you see they are mothers giving them cell phones and amen because you know how it started because today you know it came it appears as a laptop amen but what the people prefer the most is the handy top one that is that that is keeping the people busy that is the fourth dimension even even children but we have contact through science the fourth dimension through god okay let me talk to the one who can talk to me through signs not through the holy ghost [Music] amen all right then it says pictures voices of radio pictures on television that our senses does not contact that but yet they have a troop or a a troop that picks up those um hey those waves and manifest them amen now this is true signs now we we have again now through the seventh seal [Applause] signs cannot touch that one [Music] and it is through this seventh seal that we have things that you wonder how these things are sent to us in a very special way now the troop will bring the seventh seal [Music] it's happening amen amen now through this one now not science now through the revelation through the word of god the way that in the beginning was the word nothing was made there was nothing and the bible says and in the beginning was science in the word and the word was with god and the word was god i was just into i think his brother victor is here that the people whom the lord is coming for is the word [Applause] did you know that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] because in the beginning was the red and the word was made flesh so the church is the word that was made flesh i'm talking about the bride now not the church-goer not the church member but the red so he's coming for the red manifested word [Music] [Applause] amen and it is now the ministry of the word the ministry of the red to the red [Applause] this is this ministry that's why i've never seen such a ministry we can't explain to you how i was with a sister in my office here one day and [Music] when i heard things like coming into her cell phone and we knew a sound like it then i said what is that she said now no they are sending me messages now i said let me see let me see your cell phone then she opened to me but i could only see weddings school friends and so forth now i said but i want to see the things i had your cell has been downloading things [Music] i heard a sound of things coming into your cell phone then i said okay i know that you've got a secret code amen as god has given to his church the secret code and the secret code it has helped us to see the things we couldn't see all right now this girl i said all right oh give me the secret code and she said no i've given you my code i said no not this one but the secret i'm a pastor i want the secret code not that one that one is marriage of friends and so forth and i found her to be willing to give to me the secret code then i said now open up i've got the pictures home amen i will show to these elders here it is the pictures beneath the pictures now you need another code in order to reach those pictures beneath the pictures amen because you come to seven churches but you need another code to go into the seals revelation amen the seventh seal is a code which is given not to every body [Applause] it's a goal that can put you beneath and beyond [Applause] amen so these things god has put them just like that and then now you'll wonder you know that there is some some codes not from a man amen so it's a secret in the hands of those children of god whom he has chosen to give to them the schools thousands of them all right now here we are now it's opening up now for the rapture because they come in stages like that that's why i said last time we are not talking about the rapture we are entering the rapture [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen now it will take those eternal beings [Music] whom god has chosen before the foundation of the world did you read the bible do you know the ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 says as he has chosen us [Applause] choosing us away in him before the foundation of the world [Applause] you know you can read that scripture every day as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world amen [Music] comes first as the church ages which is time frame time frame church ages amen but after that the prophet says let us go our past the kitten of time because all this time we've been coming through the kittens messengers are kittens this one is opened you go through to the other one [Music] amen but you finally come to the kitten of between time and eternity [Applause] if you come beyond the kitten of time yes we will read them next next amen but now let's go back to this one now these are the dimensions then it says the fifth dimension is where the sinner the unbeliever when when the unbeliever dies he goes to the fifth dimension [Applause] [Music] a horrible dimension actually hell was not made for human beings but hell was made for satan and his angels then i asked myself meaning that those who follow satan and love satan are satan's angels hell was made for satan and his angels and that's why the prophets say in whatever you do don't you go that way you're talking about fire the fire you see here is not the fire that's bending there all right now you need to be predestinated because a christian is not a person who's trying to avoid going to hell [Music] whether there's hell or there's no hell he's a christian [Applause] even if the news reached us that the hell has been cancelled they will still remain christian because that's who they are [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he or she is not made of that thing a christian was in god as chosen in him before the foundation of the world amen let me repeat even if they can say there's no more satan they are not christians because there is satan they are christians because they were born by god they they were born of god they don't become christian in fear of hell or satan they are those eternal beings amen that's a christian all right now uh let's turn to this this horrible dimension the faith and when a christian dies he goes into the sixth dimension [Applause] and god is in the seventh dimension amen there then he said i want to see jesus where is jesus they said he's still just above but one day he will come he will pick us up here and we will go back to put on bodies again and they said we they said we don't eat here there's no numbers here what a wonderful place [Music] [Applause] when you die and you are in the sixth dimension you don't eat you don't sleep i mean there's no issues there was no tomorrow there and there was no yesterday those that are here but there's only one thing with them they are waiting for those they left behind [Applause] amen we're right now i'm going to read this and we'll close now if we go to the bible um jesus came to die [Music] why because we were sinners you know in the garden of eden men and women that's the tree of life men and the woman the tree of life and the tree of knowledge yeah that's why you wonder brother men and women in the garden of eden was the tree of life and the tree of knowledge that is men and women and he said you shall not eat from this tree but the serpent in you when the serpent arrived there he went for that tree the forbidden fruit we can't even outline it even today are forbidding fruit [Music] because they were naked and they didn't need any suit [Music] because the glory of god covered them they were covered in glory there was no lust there was no dreams amen [Music] them was satan discipline actually the sin there was the serpent that came and undressed them he said amen and then what happened god knew that should you eat from that tree you will be wise you're growing up sin have you seen a daughter i won't say your daughter i'm saying just a daughter when she begins to run she is no longer the same person she used to be because she has met a boy out of wedlock amen she will come she becomes wild i mean no team suffolk find a boy after taking from the forbidden fruit amen he will start to be stubborn you see that man they are always on cell phone no bible [Music] me [Applause] that forbidden tree i have the book already i read it to you that the tree of life and the tree of knowledge men and the woman [Music] reading the bible says he shall reveal the secrets [Applause] [Music] and the bible says after eating then they were naked before eating they were covered after eating they were naked that you've got today actually what happened what went adam was not born if was not born amen just as we were taken out of his sight if she came out of the sight of the man amen she was not born adam was not born it is sin that brought about what we call breath from the beginning it was not soul god just molded we were not born we were created all right i think we understand now that's why we must be born again [Applause] the bible says if you are not born again you shall never see the kingdom of god because the first breath this breath we call breath came through the permissive will of god but originally we were created not born [Music] that's why the bible says we must be born again amen all right so now i read this now quickly i will come here let's go back to this my book some of them are so tattered but i will fix them in order to carry on i'm going back to this again paradise now we want to go through this out of this and go up [Music] so are we together [Applause] now death brings separation [Applause] now i come back to there was a time that the people didn't go into the presence of god when they died them that are oh all right the people didn't go into the presence of god when they died they justified that was in the old testament they went into a place called paradise [Music] and there the source of the just waited in paradise but paradise was a place where god kept the soul in like a dreamland until the blood of jesus was shed before the blood of jesus was shared they were kept in a place called paradise amen and the change only came when the blood was shed [Music] [Applause] get the book of hebrews because under the blood of the goats that blood covered sin but could not take away sin but the blood of jesus therefore was to take away sin amen because the bible says for we were all sinners [Applause] born amen and we needed something that could make the difference and there was nothing the only thing we needed was the blood of jesus because the blood of jesus christ is the word [Applause] uh it says gabriel came to maryland with this code the blood code amen now and jesus was set aside coming to mary the blood that was brought to mary was delayed by gabriel [Music] now that word was the blood of god and when he spoke to me and the mary said be it unto me according to your word i mean that's when the blood started to form in the womb of mary what did they call the son of god but that was the word that mary has received from gabriel [Applause] [Music] [Applause] because if you believe the wording it is the blood of god [Applause] in you it becomes the blood then you are born of god if you go for blood tests then they will realize that with the blood that brought is not human blood it is the blood of god which is the manifested way because once it was in mary it started to manifest and they came a son [Applause] amen that is the blood of god [Music] that's why even now as i said to my brother this ministry now that day has come easy for the blood of god amen is the ministry of the manifested way which is the blood of god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] those people that are to be taken up in the rupture they are not just mere people he is the blood of god [Applause] those people are amen that's why some people a person asked how will these people change they will change because they are those beings for that coming change [Music] they shall take off the mortality [Applause] that's why they knew themselves [Applause] they know that they are they have put on mortality and they must put on immortality [Applause] they know what is immortality because they were once immortal [Applause] so they have taken on flesh [Applause] [Music] in order to manifest and now i'm going back this rapture in faith [Music] is not of this body it is of another body [Music] that's why abraham and sarah they were changing [Applause] after going without a child and abraham said i go without the child [Applause] and the lord god said to him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's right your your son so now the son of god [Music] yes we are sons daughters of god that's why the bible says he that is born of god sinneth not [Music] why he can't sin it is because he is the blood of god he is [Applause] and found to be sinless [Applause] then [Music] can never cannot sing i'm not talking about cigarette and beer i'm talking about sin cigarettes amen but why this men born of god can't sin because he is the blood of god [Applause] why this one although the gospel is preached but he he or she cannot change nothing can change you can preach with conscientious because she is of another nature [Applause] [Music] she is of another nature she knows no righteousness she understands doesn't understand [Music] a child of god is not a person that is struggling to live a holy life a child of god is born again the bible says why he can't sin it is because he is born of god [Applause] can you answer that why this one who lives a holy life always he wants to do good amen but because that is the divine nature that's in him [Applause] all right all right let me read this now when they died it says and let me go back now they went into a place called paradise in those days [Music] and then the souls of the just waited in paradise [Music] god kept them there until the blood christ shed his blood [Applause] you notice that when he died at calvary they are waiting for him until he returns when he died he brought from the grave those dead saints [Applause] that had died under the blood of [Music] [Music] i read there's a rule here like in here leaves mortar mortal beings and each one is in this great conglomeration of guilty of darkness mortals live living here now they are either influenced from this way or from that why we have read that amen let's look what happened when the lord jesus died [Music] amen i'm going to read it because if you read the book of hebrews it tells you about this how that let's turn to the book of hebrews first yes yet continually make those who come to eat perfect [Music] this is what it says for them would they not have ceased to be offered or offered because the worshiper once patched should have had no more consciousness of sin hank give him a love what was saved amen but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year because it came undone [Music] grace is when sin is taken away from thee [Applause] amen and you are only conscious of righteousness you're only thinking of how to serve god how to please god that is the only thing that is in your soul amen a christian a predestinated son of god is not struggling to quit sin [Music] [Applause] jesus was not struggling to quit sin amen sin was not found in him [Applause] and if you are born of the blood of god sin will never be found in you because life is in the blood [Applause] life in the human blood will continue singing [Music] live life he will repent fully um where even god could no longer tolerate the spirit of god could no longer tolerate men because they were born born in sin bone sinners they are children sinners their children children sinners and god said now i will take away my spirit from all flesh amen now today we have some forms of schools and institutions institutions but they won't take away sin sin continues the more we try to help the children for to quit the drugs the more drugs are coming listen you'll never never change any man maybe by talking to him or her taking her to church trying to do good to her to him you will never change her or him the only thing that can change is the blood of god [Applause] amen do you understand that's why we that are in the realms of eternity we reconciles from giving glory glory to god because if we look at what he has made us to be we wonder we crave in tears [Music] [Applause] saying there's no one like you [Music] [Applause] [Applause] rapture is already waiting in you [Music] if you are a child of god divine nature the rapture and power the [Applause] that is called the rapture in faith there is something in you already and that is from god and that thing is a countdown in you [Music] [Applause] [Music] why because the power of resurrection is already in you [Applause] right [Music] [Applause] oh my [Applause] big paul says i know him and the power of his resurrection [Applause] let's look at the power of his resurrection now the bible says if you read this hebrew it will tell you that law could never change them amen then he says um [Music] verse 16 this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days said the lord i will put my laws into their hearts amen not understood because what was in the heart of adam he was robbed [Music] of the divine nature god has put in him [Music] he kept on increasing speed [Music] you know you can find somebody flying [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know what [Applause] [Music] you only can shed tears for such people they don't know god sister you don't know god [Music] they don't know that's why the people there's a brother one day he was trying to convince his daughter he hired a film only the day of judgment and the judgment itself now there was fire that girl when she looked at that fire with a you know it's just a movie people suffering he suffered he started to attend church because she had seen fire and she has seen the people how they suffer in there but yet it was just a movie all right then after some days because every time she would remember that fire she goes to church but after a long time she forgot about that fire and she stopped from going to church now he said to the father of the girl it means that you are supposed to keep on playing that film amen so to keep that fire fear of fire in here but yet that wouldn't say that of christ only that can save him [Applause] all right it's like that let's see when he died something happened i've got i've got something here when he died oh i don't know if it is what i need here okay let's go to um book of matthew 27 i think we will read verse 50 matthew when he died that day amen did he die for you i read description verse yes verse 50. jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the the ghost or the yeah it says the spirit that the ghost and so forth and behold the veil of the temple was turned into from the top to the bottom and the earth did quick and the rocks were split to say um sorry and behold the veil of the temple was torn in train from top two bottom all right now this veil his body is a veil now here is availing the temple talking about that veil which is his body [Music] now as long as you are still walking the streets the veil was closed but when he died and the spirit separated and went to beg [Applause] [Music] because the veil was his body [Music] when he left the body [Applause] did you see that all right that veil separated a man from coming closer to god [Music] all right now i i i i i'm looking for this yeah which verse did i read 51 yes then 52 and the graves were opened [Applause] now the veil when it opened up let's follow it and the next one what happened the veil of the temple was turned into from the top to the bottom you see it's opening up down to the grave [Music] [Applause] [Music] but first the veil is opened [Applause] in order to open the grave so the power of god is coming to open the grave but it's starting the temple there i mean showing there will never again be death to his children a child of god the bible says you shall never die if you believe in [Applause] [Applause] you [Music] [Applause] the people didn't know us because we have put on a mask but we shall put off this motor and put on immortality and the bible says we shall be like him just exactly [Applause] when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is the people who see him as he is they act like him they talk like him because they see him as he is but those who don't see him as he is they save satan [Applause] [Music] as they see satan they also see satan as he is when they look at satan [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] they will see themselves [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i can't be like satan satan fallen from heaven and the people who supported him rebelling against god they were cast out of heaven when they arrive here tomorrow amen all right [Music] hey then when he dropped he went down yes if you are a child of god you are going to fit in [Applause] [Music] i always find myself not struggling did you read that where the prophet speaks about it it is in the bible they broaden the rocks the stones and so forth let's build the material but each and every stone amen they never chop those prepared stones there where the temple was built [Music] [Applause] [Music] in god the first day the first time he entered this building [Applause] when i arrived here she was already singing in bed amen [Music] [Applause] she never looked like somebody who has just arrived here [Music] she just entered and started singing and dancing unto the lord because those things when they [Applause] the church of god is a building now all those materials they are coming from east west so forth they come and feed in you don't have to chop away quit doing this stop smoking and stop that no they just come and fit in like that and start to praise the lord amen while they were prepared before the foundation of the world all right yeah something see the last thing is here but we'll come to to come to take a flight we're
