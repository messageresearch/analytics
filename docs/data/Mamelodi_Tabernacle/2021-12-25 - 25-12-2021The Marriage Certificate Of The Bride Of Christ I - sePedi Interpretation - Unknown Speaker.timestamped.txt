[33:37] jesus christ
[33:40] of christ
[33:41] [Music]
[33:44] before we start reading the word i just
[33:46] wanted to give a testimony
[33:56] [Music]
[33:59] we are well protected here by the
[34:01] supernatural
[34:03] uh
[34:15] satan was trying to stop this
[34:31] uh
[34:33] [Music]
[34:46] the testimony is that
[34:49] we are worshiping god here successfully
[35:03] [Music]
[35:13] me
[35:18] before satan can stop this conference
[35:21] saturn has the power to stop god
[35:25] conference
[35:29] [Music]
[35:38] just after 12 o'clock midnight
[35:41] at 12
[35:45] [Music]
[35:51] [Music]
[36:19] [Music]
[36:21] foreign
[36:30] now i have a daughter my granddaughter
[36:35] and my mother
[36:50] this is the people
[36:52] we know very
[37:09] [Music]
[37:34] foreign
[37:38] we started the battle there because
[37:41] i had to phone back home for a certain
[37:45] brother also
[38:02] battle with these
[38:05] spirits
[38:09] the people we know very well but
[38:14] now to your
[38:16] i
[38:17] i i don't think you'll be surprised if i
[38:19] say they worshipping mommy lodi
[38:28] [Music]
[38:41] is that god's worshippers and the devil
[38:43] worshippers
[39:02] so these people are not from any other
[39:05] church but from mommy lordy assembly
[39:15] one of them was caught
[39:18] i think it's a week ago or so forth she
[39:21] was caught early in the morning at our
[39:23] tabernacle there
[39:25] um
[39:28] [Music]
[39:37] this is a testimony for all of us
[39:58] firstly we caught up with seven of them
[40:02] and the brothers they gave me seven
[40:04] names of their witches
[40:08] family
[40:16] why i
[40:17] i bring this testimony it is because
[40:19] they were trying to stop this this
[40:33] i cannot elaborate on some of the things
[40:36] because of their sensitivity
[40:48] [Music]
[40:53] they were
[40:55] one
[40:56] two
[40:58] three four six people
[41:01] available to vassy
[41:04] we were trying to
[41:05] strangle my
[41:07] granddaughter
[41:15] last night
[41:22] [Music]
[41:32] to
[41:40] the reason
[41:43] is that
[41:44] they think that the pastor is not in
[41:47] south africa or in miami-lodi so we can
[41:50] attack
[41:56] [Music]
[42:02] i'm giving this testimony for us to
[42:05] rejoice
[42:06] over the victory that the lord has given
[42:09] us
[42:19] this testimony is not for you to fear i
[42:23] won't give
[42:28] you even last year it was the same thing
[42:38] [Music]
[42:53] so that we can all rejoice and
[42:56] know that we are
[42:58] safely dwelling
[43:00] in the house of the lord foreign
[43:24] and
[43:25] i know them
[43:26] we are like i say
[43:28] one of them is my clothes
[43:31] let me stop there
[43:34] now
[43:35] how should you swing in the game
[43:52] my
[43:57] [Music]
[44:05] amen
[44:07] [Music]
[44:15] [Music]
[44:17] satan himself mr
[44:22] [Music]
[44:30] [Music]
[44:43] [Music]
[44:48] watch the third pool
[44:54] [Music]
[44:56] i thought you'd salute god
[45:01] when they shall come against the bride
[45:07] [Music]
[45:21] [Music]
[45:30] when
[45:50] [Music]
[45:58] peter was supposed to look at him
[46:04] and as he looked at the one that was
[46:07] working upon the water
[46:12] hey this is wonderful
[46:16] now peter's problem was the belows
[46:26] he was thinking of many things the
[46:28] shacks
[46:33] [Music]
[46:35] but he said unto the lord
[46:39] if it's you walking up on the water very
[46:42] well now i'm sitting on whatever needs
[46:45] beating me to come to you
[46:50] now between peter and the lord jesus
[47:08] he
[47:09] [Music]
[47:22] he is actually putting you in the same
[47:26] mood
[47:33] meaning i'm working upon the sea
[47:57] [Music]
[48:05] some
[48:06] meters away from christ

[48:40] [Music]
[48:45] you can walk like me upon the sea
[48:51] let me hear your aiming to dance

[1:02:18] well there's so many books
[1:02:23] but we must find which
[1:02:25] of these books is our book um
[1:02:34] because the bible says
[1:02:37] our books are written
[1:02:39] in the lamb's book of life
[1:02:45] kids
[1:03:05] now this part of the the last part of
[1:03:08] this
[1:03:09] bible and is the seventh angel messenger
[1:03:25] in the garden of eden
[1:03:53] then he will pass the same thing on to
[1:03:56] adam
[1:04:02] [Music]
[1:04:09] is
[1:04:21] that's where you will find your seventh
[1:04:32] the mystery always is when god would
[1:04:36] pass on
[1:04:37] the ministry part of the ministry to a
[1:04:40] man
[1:04:45] [Music]
[1:04:53] in egypt the

[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:10] even in eden
[1:06:14] there was no man to till the ground
[1:06:29] god has done this
[1:06:33] but there's no man to kill the ground
[1:06:38] meaning that in the program of god we
[1:06:40] are not removed
[1:06:42] there must be a manchester um
[1:06:56] is a mystery of god referring
[1:07:12] if you can worship god
[1:07:16] who is in that form
[1:07:21] then you can worship god
[1:07:26] it was

[1:08:23] church
[1:08:30] every church
