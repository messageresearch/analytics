[2:20] foreign
[2:23] oh
[2:26] I guess okay brothers and sisters it's
[2:30] for you to know that way too a wonderful
[2:32] time we are having here is
[2:35] the Pastor said yesterday that it
[2:39] doesn't stop here because we'll be
[2:40] carrying it with us
[2:43] I really love it
[2:47] the word of God is not kept in the
[2:51] church
[3:00] amen
[3:02] and in our hearts eighties Wednesday too
[3:06] we don't just keep any
[3:09] word because
[3:14] the framework that is in us our souls
[3:21] the prophet says he is the mind which
[3:25] was in Christ
[3:31] now the only word that can come and
[3:35] remain there
[3:36] easy
[3:38] the word that proceedeth out of his
[3:41] mouth he is
[3:53] she went from this church to that church
[4:01] in search of the Messiah efunana no
[4:05] Messiah
[4:06] she knew that the Messiah will come down
[4:09] through
[4:11] a certain
[4:13] religious
[4:15] line why is
[4:22] [Music]
[4:24] she thought that way
[4:28] Messiah will come through
[4:31] a certain denominations
[4:41] she had not yet received the Revelation
[4:47] because the Messiah don't come through
[4:50] any observation
[4:52] um
[4:54] it's something that will catch up with
[4:57] you in your soul is
[5:04] then I read your Funda
[5:07] and I will read
[5:11] Uncle I'm just introducing to you
[5:15] something uh
[5:18] amen amen and let me just quote it again
[5:23] another book there yeah
[5:27] this woman Lois fazad
[5:30] she had something in here
[5:33] [Music]
[5:36] the prophet as he says we have little
[5:38] Stones John Prophet she was
[5:44] because if you want to keep a record of
[5:47] something you should use as to um
[5:52] [Music]
[5:54] the Lord Jesus Christ to Peter Thou Art
[5:57] zephas meaning a little Stone
[6:05] then later he said then Upon This Rock I
[6:08] will build my church
[6:13] because the stone is a
[6:17] uh and a device that can carry whatever
[6:21] for ages
[6:28] when the Apollo we were told of Apollo
[6:34] Apollo that when they reached the moon
[6:37] we are told like this
[6:42] and we are told that when they
[6:45] arrived back
[6:48] they had
[6:54] this is what we are told
[6:58] the Americans
[7:01] because in every stone there's some
[7:04] layers
[7:08] that can even indicate the the age of
[7:13] the area yes
[7:17] you must find
[7:20] a stone toilet
[7:22] Jesus is the Rock of Ages
[7:26] [Music]
[7:29] in him all the ages are registered
[7:40] let's stand up and read the word of God
[7:43] I guess
[7:46] I just want to look at the Deadpool
[7:49] catch up
[8:20] if I'm
[8:22] like I'm saying to you
[8:24] [Music]
[8:26] uh-huh
[8:34] you are being pulled we are done so
[8:40] silence means not me
[8:43] um
[8:46] I'm not fooled at all
[8:49] let's try it I guess it's uh let's open
[8:52] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 11.
[8:56] 11 verse 11.
[9:01] somebody read it for usai
[9:13] [Music]
[9:17] through faith also Sarah herself
[9:20] receives strength to conceive seed and
[9:24] was delivered of a child when she was
[9:27] past age because she judged him faithful
[9:31] who had promised
[9:33] amen yeah I recently read this in
[9:36] mamelodi and a brother said pastor we
[9:39] are going to Swaziland I think we are
[9:42] going to continue I said okay I will
[9:44] continue yeah the second scripture is
[9:47] Genesis Chapter 18
[9:49] um
[9:52] Genesis 18 verse 9 to 11.
[9:59] or rather to 14 to 14.
[10:03] attending
[10:10] why you say tea why is it is
[10:30] [Music]
[10:41] foreign
[11:03] and he said
[11:07] I will certainly return unto thee
[11:11] according to the time of life and lo
[11:16] Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[11:19] Sarah had it in the turned door which
[11:22] was behind him now Abraham and Sarah
[11:26] were old and well-stricken in age and it
[11:30] seems to be with Sarah after the manner
[11:33] of women
[11:35] therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[11:38] saying after I'm waxed old shall I have
[11:42] a pleasure my Lord being old also and
[11:46] the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did
[11:49] Sarah laugh saying shall I off surely
[11:53] bear a child which I'm old
[11:57] is there anything to hurt for the Lord
[12:00] and the time appointed I will return
[12:03] unto thee according to the time of life
[12:06] and Sarah shall have a son
[12:11] heavenly father is another wonderful
[12:14] time yeah here we've been this a
[12:17] privilege again to come in this place
[12:21] just to hear the way that was spoken
[12:24] yeah and father as the children of
[12:26] Abraham we come here father believing
[12:29] that we will receive the very same that
[12:34] Abraham has received and we are so glad
[12:37] to bless every brother and sister under
[12:40] this roof father God saw that by the
[12:43] time we leave this place we would be the
[12:46] happiest people in this world today as I
[12:50] pray in Jesus Christ's name for the
[12:52] reading of your word to be given
[12:55] revelation after this word is put in our
[12:59] hearts as I pray in Jesus Christ's name
[13:01] amen amen
[13:04] you may be citizens
[13:06] you will understand I won't belong here
[13:11] I don't uh
[13:14] I I don't want to regret this day as the
[13:17] last day
[13:21] it will it will kill me
[13:24] but I will just say it's one of the days
[13:29] amen yeah now I want to read to you
[13:32] something foreign
[13:40] start
[13:47] [Music]
[14:03] made flesh in the house of Abraham oh
[14:07] well
[14:15] thank you Saints
[14:18] I was reading being fooled about the
[14:21] Samaritan women
[14:24] just to redeem time let me just quote it
[14:28] again
[14:30] it says it this summer is
[14:33] she had a little something in her why
[14:37] not
[14:39] work as if God wants you to meet you at
[14:43] a certain appointed time yes
[14:47] he has to put something in you
[14:53] let me repeat to you again
[14:57] I've seen some I love to watch wildlife
[15:05] myself
[15:15] so
[15:17] I've seen it
[15:20] how these people wouldn't abandon they
[15:23] go deep into the jungle
[15:28] I'm twist there with some thoughts about
[15:32] your mind to trace the life of a lion
[15:42] because sometimes you just see a lion at
[15:46] the Zoological Gardens
[15:54] how it was groomed up
[15:57] just see it when it is a grown up
[16:02] amen yeah so these people together they
[16:06] go in trying to start from scratch
[16:10] to see the birth of that lion
[16:14] the manner of that lion
[16:16] um
[16:19] and until it is an adult
[16:23] now for them to do that
[16:26] since the lions look alike
[16:31] they are use a device
[16:49] then every time they come
[16:53] up to follow the process
[16:57] it can be so they come with a receiver
[17:02] um
[17:03] now with this receiver
[17:06] they will start going around in that
[17:08] area
[17:11] and
[17:13] until
[17:14] they can receive some blips
[17:17] [Music]
[17:19] about tonight
[17:25] coming out of their
[17:27] device
[17:29] then they know that the lion is in this
[17:32] area
[17:36] so they will follow the blips yeah
[17:41] [Music]
[17:45] as the blips grow more noisy
[17:48] [Music]
[17:48] um
[17:49] you know that we are close
[17:53] until they can locate
[17:56] that lion
[18:00] I think they copied this from God
[18:06] because God
[18:09] has put something in the Samaritan woman
[18:15] the Bible says she had that in here
[18:20] the Messiah is coming
[18:23] I'm going to repeat to you some things
[18:25] in order to get to this again now
[18:31] she used to
[18:34] stand on the streets
[18:37] as you know how prostitutes operate
[18:43] today she will come with the highest
[18:46] hills
[18:48] today
[18:51] and the shortest
[18:57] tomorrow salsa she comes with
[19:01] transparency again
[19:06] like that
[19:10] beyond that
[19:12] there was something in here
[19:19] now when Jesus arrived
[19:22] at the well M to Jane as he followed the
[19:26] blips
[19:29] because she has he has put something in
[19:32] that woman
[19:36] now Jesus was in now now in the area
[19:42] because the woman was in that area
[19:48] hmm
[19:50] fuse
[19:53] me
[19:58] is
[19:59] to go to Samaria because of this woman
[20:03] you tell brother timoth I was preaching
[20:05] foreign
[20:16] it caused the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:19] just take a walk to that place
[20:23] there were some other people
[20:27] as he was passing by oh my God he he he
[20:32] went down especially for that woman
[20:35] while
[20:38] when he was in the area what my closest
[20:42] court that woman was a prostitute
[20:45] but he didn't disturb the Lord Jesus
[20:47] Christ
[20:50] he went for the innermost of that woman
[20:56] the thing that he has put in there
[21:02] amen yeah
[21:04] you know you know when he said to
[21:09] um Jesse we asking
[21:12] uh
[21:15] when some will arrive there the prophet
[21:17] um
[21:20] well uh is it Jesse yes who produced his
[21:24] sons
[21:32] now as usual Danger
[21:36] he
[21:37] probably he said with this
[21:40] Sons
[21:47] I want you to conduct you in a good man
[21:51] protect yourself in a good manner
[21:56] I want to you to look
[21:59] nice
[22:07] [Music]
[22:10] before the prophet nice and you I know
[22:14] your stubborn but you must stop it
[22:18] the prophet was now in the house
[22:33] confusion
[22:40] prophet
[22:43] so
[22:45] here comes the prophets
[22:51] now Jesse
[22:54] push the first son
[22:59] like a beauty contest
[23:03] um
[23:09] foreign
[23:41] I don't look at the good
[23:44] contacts
[23:51] no I don't look at that
[23:53] I go deep yeah to find what is inside
[23:58] this
[24:00] okay
[24:10] sorry to God
[24:12] amen amen my dealings are with the
[24:15] innermost maintenance
[24:20] so God rejected them all okay
[24:28] they were all surprised
[24:35] foreign
[25:13] Hallelujah
[25:17] Joseph Anthony
[25:23] Joseph
[25:24] came to Ayah Joseph
[25:29] said
[25:34] will you join me
[25:35] to go to Rama
[25:39] and Joseph had said your people are my
[25:42] people your roses my horses Joseph
[25:46] kindness we are brothers
[25:56] and then
[25:58] what happened
[26:02] Joseph I said
[26:04] shall we inquire
[26:09] at the word of the Lord today yes
[26:14] these are the people who didn't just
[26:16] Venture into things
[26:21] they went fast

[26:49] they had to go fast
[26:52] reception buying the way
[26:54] to say Lord shall I go
[27:00] if God says no um
[27:10] so now after that let me cut the truth
[27:15] um
[27:16] after

[27:28] people today are calling their yeah
[27:34] they don't like God's prophets
[27:39] they want their own Prophets
[27:45] because God's prophets
[27:48] of the Lord Jehovah
[27:55] now Joseph he also fought had
[28:00] 400 why not 400.
[28:04] they come with one word

[32:28] you may proceed
[32:31] and the vision came down
[32:33] and he said

[34:17] one yeah
[34:27] we had some lipsticks
[34:30] they hit directly to him the prophet has
[34:34] spoken prophet
[34:39] now yes sir
[34:43] that's why
[34:46] Jesse said yeah there is
[34:55] just a small boy he's heading the ship
[34:59] and the prophet said Prophet words
[35:02] [Music]
[35:08] amen yeah
[35:09] bring that one yeah
[35:12] I want the very one
[35:16] there is yet one man yeah
[35:20] among the prophets
[35:26] from whom we can inquire
[35:29] of the word of the Lord yes
[35:34] the world hates him
[35:41] Sarah Sarah
[35:43] here is something for few minutes
[35:47] amen amen Sarah was old
[35:52] well-stricken in age
[36:02] but at that time Dallas was cut because
[36:06] it was going Beyond it was now Beyond
[36:09] time is
[36:19] and then as I'm going to read to you
[36:23] this year
[36:25] now you watch and listen closely
[36:29] guys God has promised Abraham
[36:34] now here he says
[36:43] spoken word is
[36:47] it doesn't need fast to pray or what
[36:53] it's a promise
[36:55] given by God himself
[36:59] his personal is in your house
[37:10] so you need to pray after he did
[37:16] Cabo if God says
[37:20] go wait in Jerusalem
[37:25] I will send the Holy Ghost
[37:28] so they just go and wait
[37:34] God has promised that
[37:39] even if one can start to pray that would
[37:41] mean nothing normal
[37:44] if God promises something um
[37:47] the one who is he is also able we have
[37:52] ones who will fulfill who fails the way
[37:55] that he himself
[37:58] it's God who said he wrote and send unto
[38:02] you Elijah the problems
[38:07] no matter what the world says
[38:10] but still he will fulfill
[38:15] is
[38:17] but another thing I want you to
[38:19] understand
[38:24] I will send unto you
[38:30] sisters
[38:42] and like if I say behold
[38:45] I have sent Elijah is
[38:51] good I will send Elijah unto you
[38:58] now first of all you are going to expect
[39:00] and wait for Elijah to come outside
[39:10] he says if a man opens the dog hears my
[39:14] voice and open the door
[39:19] I will come into him
[39:23] is
[39:25] not looking at that door
[39:28] he's not knocking at that door he's
[39:32] looking at your dog
[39:38] that one cannot open the door because
[39:40] before the the looking is not at his
[39:44] door
[39:49] because God never promised him Elijah it
[39:53] won't open for Elijah because
[39:55] he will only receive from God to what he
[39:58] has promised
[40:06] you won't take any another person's
[40:09] thing
[40:10] so he has promised Abraham
[40:14] now God
[40:16] um
[40:17] the Bible says little bible it happened
[40:20] to Sarah
[40:23] once she has passed H I said today is
[40:29] are you listening my friends

[46:24] foreign
[46:36] [Music]
[46:40] listen
[46:52] foreign
[47:20] [Music]
[47:26] foreign
[47:34] then
[47:36] the cheese eating and
[47:40] where is my brother gum oh yeah
[47:43] so the bride
[47:45] um
[47:46] is looking for the promised son
[47:50] um
[47:56] before the pregnant son could come is
[48:04] their bodies had to be changed
[48:12] she was too old to have a baby
[48:19] she had no milk veins
[48:21] in her breast it is
[48:41] so what happened
[48:43] God changed her back to a young woman
[48:51] amen
[48:53] and 40 he did Abraham the same
[49:01] for he said his body was as good as dead
[49:07] he had to change their body
[49:10] in order to receive the promise
[49:18] this promised son the daughter
[49:21] was
[49:23] the spoken word yes
[49:29] now God had to wait
[49:32] for them to get older
[49:35] and older
[49:38] [Music]
[49:39] than when they were older
[49:43] because the promised son
[49:46] was coming through their inner moves
[49:56] so the Bible says
[49:59] through faith
[50:07] nice
[50:09] I'll tell you
[50:11] amen yeah
[50:14] through
[50:15] and coronary it didn't it didn't say by
[50:18] faith
[50:21] but Abraham or Abraham he said by faith
[50:24] Abraham
[50:29] it says through Italy because Faith was
[50:34] already there
[50:35] in Columbus
[50:43] Abraham because the seed is with Abraham
[50:48] the city
[50:50] now that woman in foreign
[51:18] substance substance of things hoped for
[51:21] it with Bambi sources
[51:27] there are six sense
[51:30] without faith
[51:38] so
[51:39] Sarah saw the face of Abraham
[51:44] and she believed through that
[51:48] and conceived
[51:53] came through faith
[51:59] not through a specialist I am a
[52:02] specialist still
[52:05] are you here my friends
[52:08] have faith in God
[52:12] don't look at the circumstances
[52:15] don't look at the hardness of your
[52:18] problems
[52:28] is a God who wants to demonstrate
[52:32] now for him to demonstrate
[52:39] he
[52:41] organized
[52:43] that a man should follow
[52:46] um
[52:49] God knew about it he could block it
[52:53] but because he wanted to demonstrate
[53:00] he wanted to restore a fallen man
[53:05] um
[53:24] and demonstrate
[53:31] all right amen
[53:34] that is the law of God
[53:38] he said to Moses
[53:41] Moses where most when things looked so
[53:44] hard
[53:48] and he said to Moses Moses I want you to
[53:51] know this thing
[53:54] I have hardened Pharaoh's heart is
[54:02] God says to Moses
[54:12] if you see pharaohs remains so stubborn
[54:22] amen the stubbornness of pharaoh came
[54:26] from me

[54:31] why Lord
[54:33] why Lord so that they can see my power
[54:37] Amanda
[54:39] um
[54:43] God don't want to fight weak things
[54:51] okay
[54:53] that's why he says
[54:57] when the enemy
[54:59] seasoning comes like a flood
