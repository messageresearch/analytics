[4:20] and I came here scar I as my
[4:28] brother
[4:31] just a bit of
[4:35] something I'm God I had a little bit of
[4:39] something to the
[4:46] thaty so I was so
[4:49] scared this morning this is what the
[4:51] world has
[4:54] [Music]
[4:58] because ttim they didn't hear anything
[5:01] concerning the
[5:02] testimony
[5:04] just this
[5:08] one now recently I was listening to a
[5:13] brother it's my precious pastor friend
[5:18] [Music]
[5:19] from
[5:20] saying somebody in South
[5:23] Africa says he
[5:27] is amen amen
[5:30] all right amen
[5:33] now now to you let me say
[5:38] this came as a
[5:45] prophet in your book which
[5:57] book and
[6:03] brother I'm going to keep
[6:10] time he he he really cried
[6:13] [Music]
[6:15] sometime if you ask him prophet of God
[6:18] why are you
[6:20] crying he will say oh people are saying
[6:22] I'm
[6:23] God amen amen but
[6:28] after
[6:31] because the angel in the Book of
[6:37] Revelation
[6:39] uh
[6:40] John thought that that
[6:49] angel he bowed down to worship the angel
[6:54] amen now the difference
[6:58] is when he bow
[7:02] down amen amen
[7:07] and if he could if we could have said to
[7:11] thisel and said
[7:16] God he could quote and say the Bible
[7:19] says what what the Bible says concerning
[7:23] us but the thing he Bow
[7:28] Down and the angels said no
[7:32] no don't do
[7:34] it amen

[7:38] am one of the fellow servants amen amen
[7:44] and
[7:52] brother but he asked about that
[7:56] angel what was the answer we gave you
[8:00] the answer it must have
[8:04] been it must have been

[27:15] that the six
[27:17] seal has been

[27:44] it that's the
[27:47] six all right amen if we see it what it
[27:54] is the six
[27:58] is open and we see it what do we
[28:09] see

[28:24] opened amen amen but the seven
[28:28] then he said this
[28:31] one

[28:37] and even
[28:39] today will he will tell
[28:42] us whether this one is was also revealed
[28:46] or
[28:50] not okay that one because it's Moses and

[40:36] brother uh our
[40:40] brother for the ending of the seven
[40:45] SE and the opening of the new

[41:01] today let's follow
[41:06] here I'm going to
[41:10] read from this
[41:13] part
[41:19] um there was Junior Jackson's
[41:24] dream Junior
[41:28] and the prophet
[41:30] say junior Jackson
[41:34] junior the Lord let me he says Jackson
[41:41] dream the Lord let me
[41:52] interpret amen amen now
[41:57] we it it ended up with some
[42:04] Visions this a a
[42:10] Ministry a
[42:12] vision can be seen of a certain class of
[42:19] people and
[42:22] uh and become so real
[42:28] because when God wants to say
[42:31] something to somebody not the
[42:35] public he comes with a
[42:40] vision to that
[42:43] somebody or this
[42:47] people when he wants to
[42:51] talk to
[42:54] somebody alone
[43:00] amen so that the other
[43:03] one would not
[43:07] hear all right because you can't preach
[43:10] a thing that you don't understand and
[43:16] know but then if God wants a certain
[43:23] class to hear a
[43:29] so he has chosen a
[43:33] class because you he must make
[43:37] sure it is the class that can be able to
[43:44] keep the
[43:47] secret amen amen if there's something
[43:52] you want to uh bring a secret
[43:57] you want to talk secret to
[44:03] some and they want the people to keep
[44:08] it you see
[44:12] Samson
[44:14] H who was that girl de
[44:19] Delila I think think many have got delas
[44:23] in their cell
[44:25] phones
[44:29] now
[44:30] Samson I'm talking about these young
[44:33] people not not all the young
[44:37] people but those who
[44:39] have Del line
[44:45] there amen
[44:48] amen I
[44:52] now the Philistines Phil
[44:56] and
[44:58] this
[45:00] woman she thought
[45:04] that the power was the
[45:12] logs then you know they captured
[45:18] Samson
[45:20] because you was
[45:24] now
[45:27] they thought the power
[45:33] is not knowing that the hair was the
[45:38] power was not in the head but in the
[45:46] heart so he revealed that to the
[45:53] woman the one who was not supposed to
[45:56] know the
[46:01] secret and it ca
[46:05] Samson amen
[46:08] amen okay the power was where where the
[46:12] secret was
[46:13] where in the heart not in the
[46:19] head that's
[46:22] why he ended up bringing the whole
[46:25] building down
[46:29] because they were
[46:31] there in
[46:38] that talking about
[46:43] it he had
[46:47] power but now our
[46:52] sister
[46:54] and his done as a very good
[46:59] job power he's no power now but the
[47:03] secret was there in
[47:06] [Music]
[47:07] the the hidden
[47:12] power all right
[47:15] amen even
[47:18] now the enemy was dealing thought they
[47:21] were dealing with
[47:24] Samson
[47:27] but God had to
[47:30] protect what he has put in
[47:35] Sam don't worry the people think they
[47:37] are fighting
[47:40] you no they are fighting
[47:43] God who is in
[47:50] you that's why the Bible
[47:53] say you pray even for your
[47:58] enemy when your enemy is
[48:01] hungry God
[48:06] says feed even your
[48:13] enemy you know people are
[48:18] talking about
[48:22] us
[48:24] but I'm not teaching taking it upon
[48:30] myself the Lord Jesus Christ when they
[48:34] were calling him
[48:40] names and calling
[48:43] him King of
[48:46] the
[48:48] Demons the Lord Jesus
[48:50] Christ then I asked myself who am I if
[48:55] the very the
[48:58] Creator was called by
[49:02] name they said he's a
[49:05] c who am
[49:08] I and he kept
[49:13] quiet what a mighty God we
[49:19] say the
[49:21] God who could have caused them to
[49:24] vanish
[49:26] in a
[49:28] twinkl but he said forgive them
[49:32] Father they don't know what they
[49:37] do you must learn to forgive the people
[49:39] who don't know what they
[49:47] do now let's read let's start here I'm
[49:51] looking at the clock here we we'll
[49:54] continue yes amen I hear they talking
[49:57] about the
[50:01] conference yes we will follow
[50:04] him we don't
[50:07] know that's why
[50:11] C time is so
[50:15] short and the devil don't want us to
[50:18] talk about
[50:20] it the days of Noah are here with us
[50:27] and only few people can see
[50:30] that people don't see what
[50:34] time
[50:36] no they are looking for ref
[50:43] future the world almost the whole world
[50:46] is
[50:49] flooded do the people see
[50:54] that no
[50:56] they don't see what is
[50:59] [Music]
[51:00] happening
[51:02] uh even during the
[51:06] night I can wake up just to
[51:11] check the time we are living
[51:16] in but what keeps
[51:20] me full of
[51:23] joy is that there's something in
[51:26] me that that
[51:31] says expect the
[51:35] rupture
[51:40] any now that's why the real bride of
[51:45] [Music]
[51:48] Christ she is
[51:53] rapturing amen amen it's just a matter
[51:56] of
[51:58] time when we
[52:03] shall all right amen but today let's
[52:06] look at
[52:08] this we have seen
[52:11] how H God has taken us from this to
[52:17] that
[52:19] and we are going now to take this part
[52:24] only for now
[52:27] then we'll
[52:30] continue last we have read something
[52:35] here from future home page 27 home
[52:40] 27 where are you
[52:43] going after you hit
[52:49] seven amen amen you know the
[52:54] bread
[52:56] have got this
[53:02] Runway and
[53:04] uh how it
[53:07] started
[53:09] uh the prophet of God
[53:11] says you know when when the Lord Jesus
[53:15] Christ I had brother I think is G he
[53:22] he he talked about that
[53:26] when the Lord Jesus
[53:27] Christ when he
[53:31] died and uh he was
[53:36] buried actually the body was
[53:39] buried because they couldn't bury
[53:43] God the body was
[53:46] killed they couldn't kill
[53:50] God but when he was in the uh
[53:55] grave or what you
[54:00] call he told them
[54:03] already on the third day destroy this
[54:07] Tabernacle he was referring to the body
[54:10] on the third
[54:12] day I will raise it
[54:19] up he didn't say mention he didn't refer
[54:24] to somebody
[54:26] to raise the
[54:28] body now because they didn't know the
[54:32] language of
[54:37] God hey this man we're going to kill
[54:41] this
[54:42] man but he says he will raise
[54:47] the they didn't understand
[54:52] that they could stop at the time but but
[54:57] let us listen to
[54:59] this you know when they
[55:03] came with torches and
[55:07] what
[55:09] and when he said as they
[55:13] [Music]
[55:14] said who are
[55:18] you amen amen you know he dropped them
[55:22] down with one
[55:24] sentence
[55:29] when he said I
[55:32] am but at that time they didn't they
[55:36] were
[55:38] blinded you know a blind
[55:43] person instead of coming
[55:48] together and say have you seen what has
[55:54] happened
[55:56] even when after Peter he chopped the
[56:00] ear he took it from the the Lord Jesus
[56:04] Christ and just plucked
[56:07] it but still they
[56:10] [Applause]
[56:13] were that's why the Bible says they were
[56:17] [Music]
[56:19] blind
[56:21] because they couldn't see
[56:25] God In
[56:28] Action picking up an the ear of the
[56:32] young man just to plug
[56:37] it saying I'm the
[56:42] Creator I created this
[56:45] man amen amen and this I I'm
[56:50] responsible for this
[56:53] year so I put it back
[56:56] again they were just still watching with
[56:59] hellish
[57:03] hate because
[57:06] hatred makes you
[57:13] blind if you have hat you are blind
[57:18] because because
[57:20] hatred blinded their
[57:23] eyes
[57:26] they could not they could not even see
[57:29] that this man just picked up an ear and
[57:31] put it
[57:33] back
[57:34] amen blindness B the prophet are when
[57:39] the prophet say sons of
[57:41] God will be
[57:44] God what I now you put it in the
[57:49] future then what
[57:52] about the sons of God
[57:55] are a
[57:58] God not they shall be a
[58:02] God Amen now what blinds
[58:08] you we can preach
[58:11] here
[58:16] about wonderful things of
[58:19] God but if you seen that
[58:23] hatred can see that hatred has
[58:29] blinded the people to see the word being
[58:38] manifested there was one
[58:40] day uh some brothers were asked a
[58:46] question uh
[58:50] Brothers this man certain men
[58:56] is this man not having a child with
[58:58] another woman

[59:07] and that this qualified him
[59:14] disqualified to become to minister in
[59:17] the
[59:22] church even that case was not at
[59:29] why when they ask
[59:31] them don't you
[59:34] know the cabinet of that
[59:38] man they
[59:42] said why is it coming
[59:48] with hatred
[59:51] blinded can blind
[59:53] you
[59:57] and you'll do things against
[1:00:01] God against the word of
[1:00:06] God trying to show another person that
[1:00:09] you will not listen to him hatred it
[1:00:13] blinded the eyes of the
[1:00:15] people they couldn't see that God in
[1:00:23] action putting
[1:00:28] back
[1:00:30] hey
[1:00:34] hatred let's read now we are going to

[1:04:11] representative the one who died for us
[1:04:15] let me read and close the
[1:04:18] service it's page
[1:04:21] 575
[1:04:23] 575
[1:04:25] uh he speaks about the third we will
[1:04:29] come and explain the
[1:04:31] thir the thir came from the
[1:04:37] West
[1:04:40] sweeping forward with great terrific
[1:04:46] speed they picked me
[1:04:49] up that was coming back
[1:04:53] east
[1:04:55] because men was
[1:05:00] placed what
[1:05:02] was
[1:05:04] there you were to go
[1:05:10] Westward what was in the
[1:05:12] west
[1:05:14] man was placed
[1:05:19] Eastward
[1:05:22] and when men
[1:05:25] would
[1:05:26] go
[1:05:28] W what was
[1:05:34] there
[1:05:36] now that's
[1:05:39] why
[1:05:44] uh just like it said in junior Jackson's
[1:05:51] dream that the Lord let me interpret
[1:05:59] for you know if God sends you a
[1:06:03] prophet he sends
[1:06:05] you an
[1:06:11] interpreter God has
[1:06:14] spoken
[1:06:16] but for you to come around and you are
[1:06:21] here it is because God has interpreted
[1:06:25] the
[1:06:31] word it is the word you were made
[1:06:37] of but the
[1:06:39] calling it's when that word is
[1:06:43] interpreted to
[1:06:46] you is then you
[1:06:48] said is talking to
[1:06:51] me I must be baptizing in the name of
[1:06:54] the Lord Jesus Christ you'll see even if
[1:06:57] there's somebody
[1:06:59] here to whom God interpreted his
[1:07:04] word after this service he will come
[1:07:07] forth and
[1:07:09] be it's according to the to what God has
[1:07:17] interpreted all right amen
[1:07:20] and it
[1:07:22] says
[1:07:25] [Music]
[1:07:26] uh yeah
[1:07:28] amen Junior Jackson junior Jackson came
[1:07:32] to the prophet with a
[1:07:34] [Music]
[1:07:37] dream and then the prophet interpreted
[1:07:42] that dream to Junior
[1:07:48] Jackson
[1:07:52] because Junior Jackson junior
[1:07:55] Jackson if he was just a junior Jackson
[1:08:04] Juni he could actually go
[1:08:07] to say hey I dreamed but because it was
[1:08:11] from
[1:08:14] God we to God's
[1:08:21] Prophet then he continue
[1:08:26] uh the Lord let me
[1:08:30] interpret for him
[1:08:33] there on the inside of that
[1:08:37] pyramid there was white
[1:08:42] stone we'll come and
[1:08:45] see
[1:08:47] why this
[1:08:50] ministry is all
[1:08:52] about p
[1:08:56] there's a reason
[1:08:59] why let me not
[1:09:01] start we'll come next time if there will
[1:09:04] be next time the Bible says don't say
[1:09:08] tomorrow do
[1:09:10] this say
[1:09:15] if you know this days I'm so
[1:09:19] careful because Rapture can come any
[1:09:22] time
[1:09:27] I read
[1:09:29] now he says there was white stone that
[1:09:33] wasn't written
[1:09:39] on you know in that
[1:09:42] pyramid that's the reason I had to go
[1:09:47] west to
[1:09:49] connect all right now I think you'll
[1:09:52] understand where we are
[1:09:54] you know uh every time we went to
[1:09:58] church we expected to hear the minister
[1:10:09] say and adulter they will not
[1:10:13] enter but now I am talking to the bride
[1:10:19] now so you can't say to the
[1:10:22] bride
[1:10:24] and and saying adulterers and drunk
[1:10:27] cannot enter now let me talk to
[1:10:31] the yeah he was talking to the
[1:10:34] bride that's the reason I had to go
[1:10:41] west to connect with this Angel's
[1:10:49] message to come back here to
[1:10:54] it to the
[1:10:59] church we are going still going to say
[1:11:02] things you are going to see if you
[1:11:05] haven't seen
[1:11:06] it you will see God giving a
[1:11:12] book to the

[1:11:59] reveal to reveal is that you are going
[1:12:02] to a specific
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:09] person who is in that
[1:12:15] position that when you
[1:12:17] come you are a prophet you've got the
[1:12:21] word sent to that
[1:12:26] you are going to the right
[1:12:30] person because he was there before the
[1:12:33] foundation of the
[1:12:35] world but as we were
[1:12:38] sealed before the foundation of the
[1:12:41] world and we come through and the what
[1:12:46] the the RO
[1:12:50] call if God calls you today
[1:12:55] it is through a
[1:12:57] word that was
[1:13:01] spoken there was something here in the
[1:13:04] book I don't know if I can find

[1:13:55] uh I believe it will
[1:14:01] correspond
[1:14:03] amen all
[1:14:10] right don't worry we are
[1:14:18] here uh I'm let me read something here
[1:14:25] and every one of the other Sons will
[1:14:30] have the same
[1:14:38] manifestation
[1:14:41] because we are not living in those
[1:14:44] days we are living in these
[1:14:46] [Music]
[1:14:47] days and there's the word from
[1:14:52] God these
[1:14:55] days all right amen and that's the ones
[1:14:59] that was
[1:15:02] predestinated uh and that's the
[1:15:07] ones
[1:15:11] uh
[1:15:13] predestinated listen and
[1:15:17] everyone of the other
[1:15:20] Sons will have the same manifest
[1:15:27] that's why we are here having the
[1:15:30] same
[1:15:32] manifestation I believe what you
[1:15:38] believe and that's the ones that was
[1:15:45] predestinated
[1:15:47] because if I come with the way to
[1:15:52] you from the position of
[1:15:58] predestination the were the
[1:16:02] message when it reach the time it reach
[1:16:05] to
[1:16:07] you it will just
[1:16:11] manifest because it
[1:16:14] comes to a predestinated
[1:16:21] seed amen amen
[1:16:24] amen you you see the word of
[1:16:29] God brother bam says we were
[1:16:33] not made a
[1:16:38] seat amen I I want to put the way he
[1:16:42] puts
[1:16:45] it yeah he you are born
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:50] again because you are a
[1:16:56] seed for you to have a field of
[1:17:03] wheat what must you
[1:17:06] do
[1:17:09] plant amen amen and now that
[1:17:13] seed uh to next time you plant that seed
[1:17:19] again it still comes as wheat
[1:17:25] you don't pray for a certain
[1:17:29] seed to
[1:17:34] become you don't fast pray and do this
[1:17:38] and
[1:17:39] that to change a seed in order to become
[1:17:44] a kind of
[1:17:47] SE
[1:17:50] no that's why there's some Revelation
[1:18:00] Seasons at a certain time God
[1:18:04] comes and
[1:18:07] plans that very same
[1:18:10] seed and next
[1:18:14] year he will take from that
[1:18:18] seed
[1:18:19] again
[1:18:21] amen and until it becomes
[1:18:27] ages that's why today we have

[1:19:41] same
[1:19:46] SE now we are up here to
[1:19:50] manifest the season

[1:20:00] seed in order to be born
[1:20:09] again hey did you hear
[1:20:14] that you say
[1:20:17] change you know this season for
[1:20:21] change
[1:20:23] from season That

[1:20:32] seed but in
[1:20:36] another I was there you were
[1:20:40] there but today you are in another
[1:20:45] season brother says when Paul
[1:20:49] preached he was also there
[1:20:53] that's why he says I preach what Paul
[1:20:57] has now if you were
[1:21:00] there if you are here you will hear
[1:21:04] because when Paul preached you were in
[1:21:07] the

[1:21:54] now that's why I'm reading this part now
[1:21:58] he
[1:21:58] says
[1:22:00] uh actually one part I was looking for
[1:22:04] is
[1:22:05] that he says the word that God
[1:22:10] spoke did not find a
[1:22:15] place because you as I'm
[1:22:18] closing you are a
[1:22:21] place amen
[1:22:24] either you are a place of
[1:22:29] good or a place of
[1:22:32] evil but you are a
[1:22:37] place if they say God says you are a
[1:22:43] sinner it is because you can
[1:22:47] accommodate sinful
[1:22:51] nature
[1:22:55] amen then God says you are a
[1:23:01] sinner if God says you are a
[1:23:04] Christian it is because you can
[1:23:11] accommodate holy the holy
[1:23:15] nature no matter what the other people
[1:23:20] do you are not taken at
[1:23:23] all but by the wicked
[1:23:27] way or for
[1:23:30] someone you are a
[1:23:33] seed and every time when planted you
[1:23:37] will still
[1:23:45] remain that's why you are not you don't
[1:23:48] get baptized because mama got baptized
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:23:54] but what I was coming to
[1:23:57] was the prophet
[1:24:00] says the word that God
[1:24:05] spoke did not find a
[1:24:10] place until it found a place in
[1:24:17] Mary that's a seed keep amen okay
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:24] now that's why this we are going to read
[1:24:28] about
[1:24:35] things we are going to read about a
[1:24:39] thing that found a place in
[1:24:41] [Music]
[1:24:45] you uh do you accept it or
