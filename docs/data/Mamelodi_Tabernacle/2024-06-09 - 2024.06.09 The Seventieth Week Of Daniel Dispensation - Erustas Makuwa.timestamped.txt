[1:12:47] [Music]
[1:12:48] tradition those women didn't go around
[1:12:52] trying to converse
[1:12:59] it was from within their
[1:13:02] hearts but they want to take their
[1:13:05] children to that
[1:13:10] man and they believe if that man can
[1:13:12] touch their
[1:13:15] children their children will be
[1:13:19] blessed I believe it is from This
[1:13:22] Woman's Heart
[1:13:26] that if we can
[1:13:29] touch her
[1:13:33] child he will be or she will be
[1:13:38] blessed read the
[1:13:40] scripture Mark 10:
[1:13:45] 13-6 and they brought young children to
[1:13:47] him that he should touch them and his
[1:13:50] disciples rebuked those that brought
[1:13:53] them but when Jesus saw it he was much
[1:13:56] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[1:13:59] little children to come unto me and
[1:14:01] forbid them not for of such is the
[1:14:04] kingdom of God verily I say unto you
[1:14:08] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[1:14:10] of God as a little child he shall not
[1:14:13] enter therein and he took them up in his
[1:14:16] arms put his hands upon them and bless
[1:14:19] them he took them into his arms
[1:14:27] and put his hand upon
[1:14:31] them and blessed

[1:24:56] also
[1:24:58] blessed those who read and those who
[1:25:03] here because this
[1:25:06] spiritual
[1:25:09] talk is presented to the prophetic
[1:25:17] class because
[1:25:20] um
[1:25:23] scriptures uh for that
[1:25:30] group these scriptures are not for
[1:25:36] everybody they are for a particular
[1:25:39] class
[1:25:45] of before I can talk about
[1:25:48] thisth week
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:25:55] I must start from where it come
[1:26:03] from
[1:26:06] Daniel he was a scriptural
[1:26:11] man when he went to when he was taken to
[1:26:17] captivity he took some
[1:26:22] Scrolls SC he took some spoken words
[1:26:27] spoken he took the spoken word of
[1:26:32] Jeremiah I was
[1:26:35] told when my pastor was in the
[1:26:41] hospital when he went there to the
[1:26:45] hospital he also took his spoken
[1:26:51] way I was
[1:26:53] told when he was in the
[1:26:56] hospital he would have a
[1:26:59] chance to open his spoken
[1:27:05] way is what Daniel
[1:27:09] did in other
[1:27:12] way all scriptural
[1:27:15] people when they are going
[1:27:19] somewhere they took
[1:27:21] their their scriptures
[1:27:27] when they have got a little
[1:27:29] chance they open
[1:27:33] their to look what is
[1:27:37] inside amen when Daniel was
[1:27:41] there he opened the spoken word of
[1:27:47] jerem in captivity
[1:27:50] there then he
[1:27:52] found the prophecy of
[1:27:57] Jeremiah Jeremiah
[1:28:00] prophesied that they will be taken to
[1:28:04] captivity for 70
[1:28:08] years but he didn't say what would
[1:28:10] happen
[1:28:12] after he said because of your
[1:28:17] unbelief you provoke
[1:28:23] God then you will be taken to
[1:28:27] captivity Daniel when he was looking in
[1:28:31] this this spoken
[1:28:34] way because we
[1:28:37] also we must know where we
[1:28:41] are and we will know where we
[1:28:45] are if we check this
[1:28:49] booken if we check the scripture
[1:28:54] the scripture will tell
[1:28:56] us where we
[1:28:58] are because we cannot worship
[1:29:05] properly if we don't know where we
[1:29:08] are and we must also know the
[1:29:13] place because if we don't know the
[1:29:16] place we'll never worship
[1:29:20] him because he is not just worshiped
[1:29:22] everywhere
[1:29:27] he has got a
[1:29:28] place where he want people to come
[1:29:32] to so that they can worship
[1:29:37] people that's why the people asked
[1:29:42] Joshua they they said to they they asked
[1:29:50] Joshua they said to josua
[1:29:54] Joshua jhua we are ready to listen to
[1:29:57] what you are
[1:30:00] saying but only thing we want you to
[1:30:05] see is the god who was in
[1:30:10] Moses to be in
[1:30:13] you the scriptural
[1:30:16] people they want to see
[1:30:19] scriptures living in a
[1:30:22] man and if they don't see the scriptures
[1:30:25] living in
[1:30:27] him they start to
[1:30:31] wonder about the place they are
[1:30:34] in because the place where they want to
[1:30:37] be is the place where the scriptures are
[1:30:43] manifested that's why
[1:30:45] Daniel to know his
[1:30:49] time he check spoken
[1:30:52] weight check they
[1:30:55] spoken he found that they have they have
[1:30:58] left with only two
[1:31:01] years they have already spent
[1:31:05] 68 and they have left only with
[1:31:07] two to move to move back something must
[1:31:13] happen because God said we must be here
[1:31:17] for 70
[1:31:20] years after
[1:31:22] years will
[1:31:25] happen then he had to do
[1:31:29] something what what did he do he
[1:31:34] prayed he wanted to reconcile
[1:31:39] himself and his
[1:31:42] people to God because what brought them
[1:31:46] here is because they they fall out of
[1:31:49] the way of
[1:31:52] God even in our
[1:31:55] time has the
[1:31:59] channel then we must he want people to
[1:32:02] come back in the
[1:32:05] channel the channel is already
[1:32:09] there is for people to come into that
[1:32:13] channel that's why when the prophet saw
[1:32:17] the marching of the
[1:32:21] Bride he saw the two and the three at
[1:32:24] the back
[1:32:25] there getting out of the
[1:32:27] CH he didn't say
[1:32:30] repent he said go back
[1:32:33] the because the channel is already there
[1:32:36] even now the channel is
[1:32:39] there that is why I believe I am here
[1:32:43] because he in the
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:32:52] channel then he wanted to
[1:32:56] bring his people
[1:32:59] himself back to the channel he wanted to
[1:33:02] be
[1:33:03] sure that he is in the
[1:33:06] CH and he wanted to bring his
[1:33:11] people he went to God he want to talk to
[1:33:17] God that he must
[1:33:19] know he must know what will happen
[1:33:24] to his
[1:33:26] people are his people
[1:33:30] ready are they ready to go
[1:33:34] back have they make things correct with
[1:33:39] God and when he was
[1:33:42] praying then God
[1:33:46] [Applause]
[1:33:50] came he said
[1:33:54] Daniel
[1:33:56] Daniel 70 weeks 70 weeks are given to
[1:34:01] your
[1:34:05] people and your
[1:34:09] city then he he he
[1:34:15] expounded what will happen during
[1:34:22] those he divided that
[1:34:25] 70
[1:34:30] week into
[1:34:34] three he
[1:34:37] said it will be seven week
[1:34:46] period I want them to reflect
[1:34:56] I just want to pass

[1:35:04] divided into three
[1:35:08] periods it is a 7 week

[1:35:27] together they make 70
[1:35:33] weeks are you together with
[1:35:35] us it's a spiritual

[1:48:30] yesterday we were there the
[1:48:32] marriage David was taking a
