Description:
Memorial Service of Sis Esther Mokgonyana

Title: Observing All Things
Preached by Elder Peter Skosana at Hoerskool Jeugland, Van Riebeek, Kempton Park on 22-11-2024

Mathew 28: 1-2 & 7 & 16-20 | I Thessalonians 4:12-14 | Matthew 28: 50-52 | 

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about observing all the promises of the bible.

When Jesus says I am with you all way, it means there is no minute of moment that He is not with us. There is time and immortality. Death is the end of time. When you cross to immortality that is the end of time.

God promised Abraham that He will deliver his nation from bondage, and Abraham observed that promise. That promise was observed until it was fulfilled. 

The word of God is the soul of God. When God send His angels is when He gave the angel His soul. When you believe it create a purpose of God in you.
 
The bride is the spirit and the soul of God. The bride is observing the promise of the word and its power. When the word is revealed, it raises the standard of the spiritual knowledge and understanding.

The memorial is of the resurrection of our land. Our message has to do with resurrection. Your live on earth is temporary. 

Mary was observant because she had a visitation of an angel. She knew Jesus was not her child but He came after the visitation. When John went to the wilderness his father was not dismayed, he remembered that he had a visitation of the angel. When the angel comes there is an earthquake to show his coming.

The bible speaks about wars and rumours of wars. There are people who are able to read and interpret the signs. They stand behind the pulpit and interpret the word, but to some people they are mad.

few words may the Lord bless you all amen uh I would like to ask just to come and lead us here with a prayer maybe before we read the word of God Amen let us all bow our heads amen great Jehovah we are coming to that sacred time the ministration of your word Lord the songs have been sung the atmosphere has been created we are looking unto thee the author and the finisher of our faith here is our elders kosana Lord coming to speak to us I pray oh God that you anoint him speak through him that we can hear through us oh God I pray we commit all things into your hands in Jesus name amen amen amen let us uh read from The Book of Matthew I like I would like us to read from the first verse first and second verse 28 28 first second verse and and then the seventh verse only three verses 28 [Music] Matthew Matthews 28 verse 1 and 2 then 7 in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the the SLE and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and set upon it verse 7 and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galile there shall ye see him L I have told you and let's jump over to verse 161 17 I mean from verse 16 up to 20 then the same chapter amen then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and Lord I Am With You Always even until the end of the world amen amen you may be seated God bless you I greet you once again and I greet also the elders and the pastors behind [Music] me and and may the Lord bless you okay mine I've got only 30 minutes here I I won't be long yes we know the family they are very notorious coming to the word of God they serve the Lord wholeheartedly yeah they serve the Lord we uh know them in all the outreaches and the brothers are always assisting in the technical they are a blessing to to the church and and Mama also was very supportive to the church [Music] and her daughter too and the the grandchildren so it's just a family that really love the Lord so now now that we are gathered here ours is just to go to the word of God as usual I was just thinking today uh that it's quite a number of people that have dived this year that that is a sign now if you read my subject will be on verse 28 onse [Music] it says here teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded [Music] you and lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world so my title will be observe all [Music] things now I I went and check even if I I I I knew the way to observe but I just wanted to be sure it means uh to watch [Music] carefully to observe means to watch carefully and it says especially with attention to details now that is why I'm saying if many people depart we we need to observe and go to the scriptures and check to see actually why is it yeah know we know that quite a number of people are going but there's a there's this year is quite a number of them I have the record and then I wrote them down all of them because I preached in their uh uh uh uh Memorial services so now our Lord Jesus Christ here the Bible says in in in in uh uh Matthew 28 verse1 28 verse1 it says it was the end of Sabbath as it began to Dawn towards the first day of the week Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the and there and behold there was a great earthquake now usually if there's an earthquake everybody will feel it remember when our Lord was giving out the ghost the Bible says there was something that happened the moon itself there was Blackness there was thundering the veil of the temple you know about that but now people could not observe it was something it started with the soldiers they will just say yeah surely this was the Son of God and then it ended up there now going to Matthew 28:6 28:6 after the resurrection or before the resurrection he said to them uh we will meet meet at Galilee and then but they never observed that not even a single one of them went to galile and and what is happening now there are scriptures that speaks about the end time of which very few observe [Applause] that and and when he was departing remember in verse 17 it says they ended up meeting in Galilee in the mountain right on top of the mountain where everybody can see him that he has resurrected now verse 17 says and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted his own disciples that at with him slept with him but they doubted him you are standing right in front of same image but they doubted some worshiped him some doubt right amen that is why now I I would speak about observing all things people were seeing him right on top of the mountain in verse 18 it says and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth but people still doubt that power L he says all power is given unto me in heaven and all Earth but still there are those that want to challenge you am right amen that is why he said in verse 20 he taught them to observe all said they must observe all things when he taught his disciples he was teaching us because those disciples and end up being Apostles we are reading the teachings of the Apostles right amen so he went on and say I am with you all people still doubt look what he said I am with you always right amen now if he says I'm with you all we there is no time or a minute or a second where is not with you so he's always with us amen there are signs that are relevant to the occasion remember we are mortal when we cross over to immortality there's something that will happen there's a sign that is going to happen when one cross over to to mortality remember that there's time there's immortality death is the end of time what people go what people call death is the end of time when you cross over over to immortality that is the end of time right amen we are getting now into another dimension we have been Ash now into eternity are we together that is why a wellknown scripture in the book of Thessalonians first thians you don't have to read it I'll quot it he says but I will not have you to be ignorant concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope you have to know that one is crossing over to immortality are we together so that is why now we should be very very very observant of the signs that indicate to us the details of promises [Music] mind you we said to observe is to watch carefully especially with attention to details now there are details of promises in Genesis 15 the Lord spoke to Abraham and said your seat will be in [Music] bondage but I will come and take them out Abraham Abraham was observant of that his son Isaac was observant of because Abraham observ the angel of the Lord there are people that are not observant of the presence of the Angel of the Lord Abraham was very observant and even taught Isaac Isaac was very observant he even taugh Jacob Jacob knew that this is the Angel of the struggled with it and said bless me he knew that was an angel and all Israel was observant of the Joseph was very observant but come to the Gentiles they are not observing right amen so it's it's a promise of the Divine visitation let's take the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ everything was displayed on the sky there was an a star there Angels going up and [Music] down otherwise if they didn't see that wouldn't be knowing about that because it is written in the Bible it was displayed look when Mary met Gabriel the Bible says Gabriel said you will conceive in your womb and bear a child that was the word that comes from eternity God gave those words to Gabriel Gabriel was not carrying them on his hands like they were in the heart in the soul of and when he gave those words to Mary he spoke them it was from his heart his soul and then it went to the soul not to the the word of God is the soul of God and if the word of God is the soul of God when God sent his Angel he gave his soul to the angel and when the angel comes with that weight that we will land on the soul of the individual then you will believe it and when you believe it then it will create the purpose that is why now when one depart he goes back where he come from because the body we buried but the soul we cannot bury the soul come from God and it will go back to God so when you depart you go back to where you come from if you are not predestinated of course you you you you cannot go to uh the sixth Dimension so now God that is why his word comes from his [Music] heart that's why he's got he's got a bride the bride is the heart and is the soul of God now that soul of God it's observant of his father because the bride is very very observant because it's the promise of God and is aware of the power and the life of the we see amen there's a we there's a life of the there's a word there's a revealed word and when the word is revealed it has power that is why now when the word is revealed it raises the standard and also the knowledge and also the understanding when the word is revealed the knowledge the standard of the the spiritual knowledge it's risen right amen now if the standard is is risen then you are know you will know that you are a stranger in this world you are an ambassador in this world there are signs that will make you to observe that you are an ambassador that is why there will be a time when you go actually the the memorial memorial it's not the memorial of the departure of [Music] sister no is the memorial of the resurrection of Our Lord when somebody depart we have a memorial the memorial has got nothing to do with his departure or departure our memory we see our Lord Jesus Christ resurrecting so our message has to do with Resurrection because we know that we are strangers here we observe that we are about to go the Bible says after he resurrected he went up the mountain he spoke to them then uh after speaking to them there was a sign a cloud came and received [Music] him that was a display for everybody a cloud look he was on top of the mountain everybody could see that he's on top of the mountain and the cloud is seen right there it came then the Angels Came also and said that same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like he will come in that f as you have seen him go to heaven you will see [Music] him now the cloud is displayed in each and every houses of the children of God most of you have got a it was displayed right on the sky most all and actually all the churches in the message they have the it's it's a display right but now when you have that display it should not just be displayed without observing there should be always should always observe everything that is happening that has to do with your going away your life has is just a temporary life here on [Music] Earth but the reality is that you are going in the book of Acts chapter 1 no no no in Matthew 27 verse 50 it says ver Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the G then 51 says and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twine you know that Jerusalem the temple in Jerusalem there's nothing that will happen to that Temple without all Jews knowing about [Music] it when that was H rent into two they should have observed because they said crucify him crucify him and when that V was rent to them I don't know whether they thought it was a magic or what that was a sign they should observe that this is not just an ordinary you know Mary was always observant Jesus when he was still a young man at times will get lost they will seek and find him and then they will try to repr remind him then he would say you are not my my my my my parents immediately they will they will remember because they had a Heavenly visitation knew that angel spoke to he was very observant Joseph knew that that was not his son he was very observant about John he was watching him very observant when John left the family and went into the Wilderness his father was not dismayed and an angel spoke to him he was very observant now the Bible says let us not be ignorant about the ones that are asleep we should be observant of that scripture that we should go are we together there was a day we've read it that the two Marys went to the tomb the Bible says an angel came and when that angel came there was thundering throughout everybody had there was there was earthquake everybody could hear there's quite a lot of [Music] earthquakes there is quite a number of angels investigating judgment Angels coming on this planet investigate but people are not observing no right amen so the two ladies came when an angel left [Music] eternity crossing over to this earth there was thundering I always together there was earthquake it remove the stone and put it and even sit upon it the sit upon it there were soldiers who were guarding they vanished they fainted but never repented they will just say that that guy is very terrible and continue with their Liv there are signs that are happening in front of our eyes in this world in this earth the Bible speaks about wars and rumors of wars we see them in everything but we don't do anything we see everything coming to his completion are we together now I said I'm not going to belong but the Bible says Graves were open there was earthquake after the earthquake remember the earthquake was that the Lord should make them aware when the angel comes that there's an earthquake now there are people that will read the signs and when they interpret what they have read people will think that they are mad they will point a star that star differs from Star means the Messiah is born together and then when that is done they say no these guys are mad people can interpret that there are people that can stand behind the ppit and interpret the word as Jes people say they are M right Graves were open when he resurrected Graves were open and many bodies of the S they rised then they appeared they appeared to many they saw them they saw them but what have they done nothing it now even today that's what people are doing okay maybe because of time we'll continue tomorrow may the Lord bless you praise God Amen [Applause] what a day that will be when my Jus I shall see oh when I look upon his face the
