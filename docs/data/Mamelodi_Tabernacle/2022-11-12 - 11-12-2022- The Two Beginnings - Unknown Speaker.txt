Title: The Two Beginnings
Description: This message was preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima at the Lily of Valley tabernacle in Malawi Lilongwe on the the 11 December 2022. During the service he read Revelation 21:1-4 “ And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.” He also read the following scriptures; Genesis 1: 1 and John 1: 1-6 to teach the Church about the first beginning which is the creation and the second beginning which is the unfolding of the word.
