Description:
*The Threefold Revelation of God
Description: This message was preached  by Pastor Israel Nkodima at Smart School in Soshanguve South Africa on the  25 December 2022. 

The primary purpose of this sermon is to make both our viewers and community aware that Our Lord Jesus Christ unfold himself in threefold, showing the Church that today God is manifested in the thirdfold which is in a Man. During the service the Pastor read John‬ ‭14‬:‭20‬-‭22‬ “At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?” and Revelation‬ ‭8‬:‭1‬  “And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.” The Spirit of the Lord let the Pastor to teach on the title of the Threefold Revelation of God . The Pastor  also read  Spoken Word - "Christ Is The Mystery Of God Revealed" “449 Jesus said, “At that day,” that’s this day. “At that day,” when this revelation is made known, “you will know that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me; I in you, and you in Me.” When the revelation is made manifest, “At that day ye shall know that I and the Father are One; I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me.” Then when the revelation comes forth, then it’s, “I in you, and you in Me.” There you are. See the manifold, threefold mani-…What for? To bring it back. We’ve got to be. 
As Jesus was the Word of God, He vindicated the same. If He—if He wasn’t the Word, He wouldn’t have made manifest the Word, He’d have been some great theologian. That would have been the real messiah the world was looking for. See? Yes, sir, that would have been. 
He also read additional scriptures Revelation 21: 1-2, 9-11.

so worry Lord Jesus it is soul that has been waiting okay so reliability this Soul was there before the foundation of the world amen amen and we know where we come from let's find that same book Isaiah chapter 55. if I send my word of course of course it shall return unto me but not void God says if I the Lord God sent my word shall not return unto me void because that word must manifest that's why the subjects are singing amen amen he is coming wait we also are coming amen we have been longing to meet him face to face are gay you know that book of uh Revelation chapter 21.21 every time I read it I have to stop my tears from the soul so the the Jesus I've been following reading about him now I what's left for me is to meet him now look into his face and Shake amen you have that in your soul now we read about you of course the Bible says before the foundation of the world we were in him come away okay amen but at the end of time we are looking at a threefold revelation the brother will read it for us let's take it from John chapter 14 verse 20 to 23. Johanna 14 verse 22-23 then we'll end up reading Revelation chapter eight verse 1. chapter 8 verse 1. ready brother already one issue okay John Chapter 14 verse 22-20 one if that day he shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Jude does not Iscariot said Judah said unto him not Iscariot Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my weights and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him Revelation chapter 8 verse 1. and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about a space of half an hour God bless you okay all right shall we ask our pasta yeah from Zambia Zambia to say a word of prayer for us before we get engaged pillory eternally Jew in their proceedings amen our great Eternal God yes and changing father amen the same yesterday today and forever so thank you for this hour that you saw before the foundation of this world that we shall live in a better time Lord that indeed we are ready for you to come amen even this our Lord we dedicate it in your hands as we commit your money servant that you put him aside using fathers Universal to speak through and to your children father we believe that you are here and you are going to speak and we are ready further to receive from thee and you o God start with us and with us in the precious name of Jesus father we do pray amen amen amen God bless you sir okay amen so let's take this subject I return the floor say a three-fold revelation of God I mean foreign we come with inspiration after the pastors preached today is it too impossible to have all these pastors if all of them could come in give us the word of God I believe one day it will be possible we'll sit down and count some days amen well I'll greet you after this um you know I was looking at something here we are here in the days of the manifestation and this is this is how sometimes I start I start with a very long yeah but it's not diesel I said this is and he said Ari I am the voice of the one crying in the wilderness okay that's how Jonah dressed the people there what do you say of yourself I Am The Voice Isaiah 40 okay Josiah the voice in the wilderness John knew himself to be that scripture I mean and he was that manifestation I am that scripture foreign amen [Music] in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word was with God's meaning the word was the mind of God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh amen that is manifestation and dwell Among Us when Jesus was working the streets of Jerusalem okay I mean he is not a change and so I you will see the difference why you know the Bible speaks of the bride of Christ learn the praise of Christ the bride of Christ is not in pieces you can't have the blood of Christ there the bride of Christ there the bride of Christ one bride of Christ denying a part of the word another bride saying the seals are not revealed can that be the bride no the bride when you're if God brings his weight is just like a husband married husband amen when he brings his word there must be the place of that word you know you should be a place amen because he said to those men around him will harasses and so forth he said my word has got no place in you because the weight must find a place when the wait finds a place and it is manifested in that place amen amen amen so like now I'm reading out of the spoken word spoken with you we said the Bible says we believe I will send to Elijah the prophet he shall tend the hearts of the people of the children thank to their fathers and policies polar about the God he says he is the god whom I worship from my forefathers amen not because somebody testified to me no it is from my forefathers it comes through a supernatural lineage walking I mean now before we start reading here I want to quote to you something here oh behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet now let us specify I I don't believe any Prophet I believe Jesus foreign amen amen but because it says listen I will send unto you let's specify it's not to everybody prophet now to whom it is to a place then you'll hear from that place saying literally the Lord has sent Elijah the prophet Morena there was a legend let's follow them and Elijah and there was Elijah the spirit of Elijah came to Elisha Then There Was the Same Spirit that came to John the Baptist they shall go before the Lord and for the last days also so it says now you would I will send unto you but if he is not sent to you you will never see and believe it because you only believe the one that is sent unto you because you are not believing a man you are believing in the world unto you that word should be picked in the body in their body will receive the message that's how it works don't argue with somebody saying I don't believe any Prophet I believe only this is sent unto you not him so now we are invited in him remember the unveiling of God this is all that he is because God wants us let us make men right amen hey let us make men have you checked yourself whether you are in His image or you are just a judge a church a believer of anything or foreign that's not manifestation manifestation is not to choose the word you can't choose the weight from the word of God it should be the way it is okay amen that's why when I worship I'm worshiping him until a brother asked me he said I you know you have lost weight I said yeah it is because I want to take the shape of my foreign okay I'm not saying I'm I'm starting to gain again I think all right so now we are invited into him remember to be pop take us off all that he is we are invited into him remember which is heat to unbelievers by the veil of human flesh it's a manifest you know Amen to somebody is just the way forward I preach the word of God that's good but let it be a manifestation God has spoken already it is no more a word it's a reality God said let there be light that was the way but now it actually there is light theater foreign you've never got repeating that again and you can't be if I see you hey Google talking to a man uh whom you class as a Christian but saying to him you must love love your brother foreign I don't laugh because the word says love now I love because love is in me now you don't have to repeat it to me because it is being manifested you are looking at me the manifestation of that word now we will start here now now we are and that was the wait but now there is light see it is all it is in the weight it is let's take Revelation and follow this now Revelation chapter 8. when he opened the seventh say brother when you open the seventh sin the seventh thing and it said nothing yeah now I look for it even some few days ago there is a I remember when I was in Cape Town I was told by a brother after we greeted a brother we let on the street Brothers he said well it was not a gossip once I say he just said you see that brother foreign [Music] about the space of half an hour don't try it in their Church say but what do you want to say because it says when you open the seal silence what do you want to say amen if invited there I would know what to do now comes in this manner because whether it is silence in heaven it still has to be manifested amen amen because it's the wind that went forth already okay and when he opened it is not closed opened I mean well okay amen I can talk to my brother here verbally you'll be listening to me but the word that I'm going to keep to myself maybe saying this one I'll tell him one day he won't hear me he said something reserved me I will tell him this is now once it is then it is but it was kept until that day in April is I believe it will answer it will give us the answer because the all the peoples through the generations they come back he opened the server when the seventh was opened silence then they go back oh I know thinking that there's nothing but it is opened apron amen the thing is open but they don't see what is that oh you know the prophet mu profita about the the pyramid he said to the people look inside the pyramid camera pyramid and what was inside with no writing money the people look inside but they couldn't see anything nothing was written then it says then they started walking away when he returned only few he found only few still looking amen then I said to you there's a type that I know and of some doubts that I saw working along the uh it was what you call these things of the water display of something I don't know what do you call them Fountain maybe yes and it is Seated on that wall or what you call it I'm looking inside and inside is water amazing now they could see their images in the water come on now I was with my brother-in-law then I said do you see my brother what's happening because they were working around after three they chose to be three so they were working around the dike like this but looking inside like this so I said to my brother I want to see what's happening they just flew away we Disturbed them okay [Music] this dance they saw themselves in there and those who remained they saw themselves in there because that white stone there was no writing on it a real writing one side of them they couldn't leave their place that's why we are yeah people come and go but we will remain because we have seen ourselves that's the difference the one who has seen himself you will never leave that place if the Jesus you worship you have seen yourself in him never quit I mean if the Gospel wherever he followed yourself you will never leave that gospel because your image let us make men amen [Music] I mean I mean Adam also in you because being a mirror release after he has lost their reflection but the merciful god okay I can't see myself amen because he could see himself and it was for Adam to see himself in him where have you been worshiping have you ever seen yourself now how far we born that's why you left that's why the Lord cannot leave you Morena [Music] because you are his image amen okay I mean oh no usually I'm taking this now yeah many people believe that although I'm not talking about the people and I won't say anything wrong about some other people I read you know the Bible says it was silent what about the Earth I mean amen you know if somebody say to me you know in heaven is I'll say Yeah well yeah you can hear the noise around here we are here all right you wouldn't mind about it in heaven it's not here on Earth while it was in heaven and it was all quiet on Earth what was happening because on Earth there was an announcements about that do you know Adam that's about Adam on Earth when God will demold the things that's how creation came about and things you know create something bring it over to Adam Adam for Adam to say what would Adam saying right amen it didn't come with a text telling Adam that thing is Adam after Adam the Bible says Adam would call Adam by name amen because Adam coward Adam was the other part of the contract God would send something to Adam Adam had only already that answer Adam because Adam was the god of the Earth and God been the god of the universe now that's why we have Eden and the garden was the headquarters of God and the Garden of Eden the headquarters of his son what happened Adam would knew anything proceeding from God it is how it was if at that time perhaps you are in heaven and you see God molding something uh well God where God where God moved the things if you happen to be there it will come from there without the name because there's another partner of the contract that's right for for the word of God God sends some prophets a prophet is a past partner amen amen he is the other part of the contract with God God will do this and live another part for the men we all know that right I can give you one again Blended so we'll have foreign [Music] so God sent him to the part of the contract prayed for him and so forth okay amen do you want another one Philly Philip was on his way was somewhere else but there was a man from Jerusalem that man prayed and prayed to God and then he was reading the book of Isaiah couldn't understand it so he prayed then what happened state of God giving the direct answer because God has a partner he comes in a contract man is God's partner saw Philip King philippiac that man could have said hey I prayed to God not you know amen ugly people what about a partner the pattern of God comes you can hear men who God is a man sent from God Amen [Music] that means he is part of the way you don't see him amen amen that's it I mean there is a part of God that he has sent in the end time okay I mean that's why silent in Heavens now we look into the Bible and realize that they were things in heaven Lord the Angels were familiar with things in heaven but we are going to read after global how the Angels come over so those things now being sent down by him no while you are wondering we are going to read here it says the angels in heaven stopped by by Amisha I mean there was a scenery of some kind that caused the angels to stop says things were not ordinary anymore because they were looking at things being sent down now it was silent in heaven what was happening you're going to find in the Bible because the people rejoice

and make war you had a prophet the man of God yesterday amen his I swear as a flame of fire and on his head with many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with vesture deep in Blood and his name is called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses both in fine leaning white and clean foreign the army of the one coming from Heaven on a white horse and a metal amen amen because the bedroom the White Horse and the name of the one of the pain on the pillows is called the Bible says his name is death but this one his name is so it will be death against coming against the word of God all right amen that power that horse with that power and the Saints followed him predestinated some of them are here already he's a warrior I know when he confronted this pale horse rider he was called Michael with a sword even the Bible said to Daniel he will wait said to Daniel Michael will stand for his people Satan wanted to take over position I shall not be any other party yes until he dropped down here he looked and he saw Adam in the garden I mean he was angry after that he saw Adam said that man has taken over my poster I must deal with them because this Lucifer was the right hand man of God but he wanted to take over and he was pushed down and he went down here he started the battle here amen amen and it's been raging Valentine until it will it will end up in the battle called The Battle of armagedding all right he will come on a white horse now those people but wow that will come with him

now you watch that people that are going to fight the Battle of armageddonough it's still the people it's alive the winners buffets are going to be the winners amen now in heaven it was the Battle of angels and listen to the prophet he says angels in heaven about the beginning which we have hit which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us God bless you I read this scripture every

again because you are a seed amen I read it in the book changes he that is born of God that's the route of a change born of God that's why Galatians chapter 3 says it says of the Seed of Abraham that this Seed of Abraham say it the Seed of Abraham amen is Christ amen Galatians chapter 3 verse 16 yes now to Abraham and his seat where the promise is made he saith not and to his to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ does it amen not to cease The Men Who made melchized all right amen who is this milk yesterday but he came as a man he came to abrahamas in the house amen but the Wonder of it all is he was looking at Melchizedek inside the one without mother without father the beginning of this ending of this person who can see that man the one who has no beginning so you could see God inside Abraham Abraham and now you too the Bible says you are the Seed of Abraham the Seed of Abraham it can it can see God even God even if he comes like when he met Peter said where shall we go with you he has seen God in Jesus amen amen amen the real you know can see God your theophy theophany has got no father no mother now it can see somebody who who has no father it can see the real you inside there amen a life that has no beginning I mean why we can't go to do things worldly it is because you have no father you have no mother you have no beginning a person who knows God can never sin the Bible says he that is born of God foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] a person who has eternal life cannot see amen amen amen because his father is God and I I I I I I'm where is my where is my wrist watch brother my I mean my world and now we look at John 14. at that day you shall know that says the Lord yeah there's a day that you you shall know that I am current in my father and oh let me read it let me just say let me read it read it I'm going back at that day you shall know that I am in my father and he in me and I in you amen I am in my father and you in me and I in you how many things do you see all right amen it is called a three-fold mystery of God now you watch them is revealed we are going to read them is revealed under these threefold no the free food it says hearing God dim or Spirit Moya then the logos logos then out of the logos came for them out of God we look at the logos then out of the logos okay amen now you are going to and we are going to see that the secret Superior when he opened it comes under this three-fold but we will read it here you are part of the three foods okay brother's time and listen till it now free food and let me take it again from your book here what is that what is that book brother Christ is the mystery of God thank you brother thank you amen you have been watching enjoy the village uh the the it's just yeah it's just here the Bible says I've got this book here page 60. the Lord Jesus says at that day there is a day you shall know he doesn't say I shall know you shall know I am in in me it is called free food mystery of God okay amen that means any form of a Ministry already is known to these three foods [Music] because it makes you part of it he says and I in you come only now if there's something that is a mystery and if you are part of the free food then you know that minute if the mystery is made known then it is made known to the threefold now the answer well is with you part of the threefold you know of the summer written women when he has come actually he he will you know she was part of it amen being part of it she knows that when the Messiah when he has come he will tell us all things amen and he was a beautiful I mean because in every child of God there is a certain secrets that secret will take it will recognize the Messiah whether you are a drunkard prostitute women she was standing on the street everybody started doing this with a transparency a very transparency and the highest hills on the street but look at the mystery of God inside of that date there was a sign I know Messiah is coming see awake while doing this yeah I mean are you with me a prostitute thoughts while stopping cars like this but there's a secret I know while I'm doing this there's something in here and when he has come happily all this prostitution will stop amen amen amen amen I'm waiting for the Messiah she would go through the summer written Church it would not save him and then until that was the signal in here then when the Messiah arrives he has come forward amen you know when he comes to you right come on you don't come to your live eyes to the inside and Messiah started going inside of that body go and call your husband until he arrives when he arrived at the place the woman also said I perceived because no man no one has touched that place amen she left running to the Village saying come and see is this not the Messiah let me come back here I'm watching foreign so a few minutes to go yeah don't worry we'll make it Heaven is not far now let us read this now we yes my book here we have the sixth seals now there are six seals when it was opened it showed Moses it was opened by little tree okay do you know that yeah Moses and actually then you will come to mum Transfiguration Moses Elijah and Christ so it's threefolded for the Jews it's the tribulation because this 144 about 144 000. uh they are not they are Jehovah Witnesses but which is the Jews this is 144 000. you will see them they come through the tribulation period but uh me tired there and then but after that we see them at the millenniums they are amen when the bride the gentle bright come on young woman guys is married they stand there we shall reduce it it is in the world working but now here more the sixth year has been opened to us foreign The Mystery of the six cells Moses they are responsible for that um it was omitted the revelation of the seven and here when the seventh seals when he opened it he also omitted it so we see that it is a complete mystery therefore the hour is not yet for the mystery to be known yeah foreign [Music] Jesus appears on the Earth I mean the 70s then they said it is not revealing then it says but later come around just about time and the rest of it will be known we will be will be known right what takes place at that time it will be revered look out it was opened says it will be revealed because it was revealed him all right but to the rest you see a foreign like John was a foreign that take away the sin of the world that's a forerunner telling them he has come forward I mean I mean no yes they last foreign [Music] so do you know that yeah that's why the Bible says the sea shall be no more inhabitants who inhibits the city do you know that yeah the prophet calls it under um we can read about them in the Bible even the creatures of the deep speaks of that but because [Music] the devil operated Saturn over over America and Jesus died but the Bible says we believe when he died when he went away with a guy to hell because one key he gave to Peter the key of the Kingdom said Peter Pedro because Peter answered the Living God my father has revealed this I will give you the key you have opened up now here's the key yeah right did you see that but there were some other Keys the key of Kia hell and hedges amen so Revelation chapter one Jesus came back with those keys when he died all right he went to the atomos we level to go his soul the body went to the Grave the body me but the soul if the soul went down to the atoms yeah and took the keys because Lucifer Lucifer lived there but hell was not burning I mean it says hell is that is the headquarters of Lucifer Lucifer he was the Bible says the Lord Jesus went to hell itself took the keys very key somebody was preaching saying Jesus survived the fire of hell when he went there you should hear them silent angel messages but he came back with the keys and when John saw him he fell down fear not it's a boy I am he that was dead now I am alive and have the keys all right Amen on the day of judgment I will open up and they help me catch fire all right you know you think that Satan was in a in some flames of fire in there the fire is coming away foreign it's all Darkness fed and you are going and going forward we're talking with a brother as you know Judas is still rolling he betrayed God the son of God and Jesus said of it it is foreign he was talking of the terrible punishment that Judas was facing what did he say Aaron what Jesus what what did Jesus say ing amen amen amen now they think he was born whoa all right that's why it's a who unto foreign everywhere you go is money rituals and you know Satan can promise you 10 billion but not for my Allah he will say bring that child and you'll get millions but it can be for three years you have to sign that San Jose that people don't mind today to sign for their Doom was their blood just to get Millions and fly a jet my flight is fun but the day every time party there's a man who went uh we we have done the first party to deal with this party I think God is going to answer our questions he went to magicians and it was also for money ritual he lived on Monday which one so they took him through their thing and he became a magician a federal magician well money was coming from this side you know you can buy a ship you can buy you know but nothing is you know that yeah they come with a note telling them this is for five years yeah five years some that man when the time arrives he knew it I see it he knew it he cried Allah telling the people now that or my time has come who would help him in such a situation he has sold his soul no there's no refund today once the soul is sold foreign my time has come knuckle we are blessed our time has come for to go yeah no not for to die amen amen now that's why a man without God can even put her his own soul on stage just for some papers then after that the soul is gone when he dies or she dies she's going through hey you can't talk about it that's why we sing of Mercy let God have mercy on us the day actually the day is not coming today we don't know whether we'll have another conference I was just giving out the first phase here will come to they're not willing Stars the pastor has given us me another time just to come to this now we're going to read out of the book actually what is the seventh it is revealed or not it is here in the book but you're going to realize is right before his appearing house it is revealed beautifully but only in a three-fold which threefold um he said and I in you now you will see that it is revealed to the three-fold three fold three meaning that you are part of it only the threefold knows about their sevens it's a great mystery amen amen but you realize that you are part of the threefolds and you know what is the servants amen amen let's say let's say our that's why our soul is saying is how many can say come on Amen I said really sometimes I'll talk to somebody I think in 10 years time we will be having a soil you know I shrinking okay I said okay I can't say in the Years time I can only say they're not willing okay foreign because according to the science
