========================================
[Music] Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; One day he was on his way to Damascus &gt;&gt; to arrest the only way God made a roadblock &gt;&gt; because that you know that is the mystery of predestination. [Music] &gt;&gt; A one time enemy god. He was his son of predestination. So he was coming &gt;&gt; talking about we must get rid of this Christian. Amen. Amen. Then God stopped him a light strike across. He stopped there. Then from there what did God say to him? Go to &gt;&gt; he will tell you &gt;&gt; because out of the contract. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God had his people here. pray to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the economy of God. &gt;&gt; Paul, he was blind. [Music] I've done this part. Another part there will do the rest. [Music] Amen. So he was going to &gt;&gt; blind him what to do and what amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; What did he do about it? &gt;&gt; Philip was somewhere. away. &gt;&gt; It's emergency. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody on a chariot. So, Philip just appeared there. Hello sir. Yes sir. I'm struggling here. I'm reading about somebody here. &gt;&gt; Who is this man? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know these people. They never just read the Bible. While reading there was something in them. Who is this man? [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who is he? &gt;&gt; Then Philip &gt;&gt; interpreted to him that this word was made flesh. He dwelt among us. And the man was baptized right away. He had just vanished. So the answer to that man was &gt;&gt; now in closing. &gt;&gt; We won't finish but we'll close. &gt;&gt; All right. Now we are still there. In the beginning was the word and we see now the attributes became words &gt;&gt; and they became persons. And this people when that word is made flesh [Music] and among that was a man. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; He was a man. &gt;&gt; That's why you because you can't see him from your mind. &gt;&gt; There was now a correspondence between him and Peter. They look beyond the human flesh and see that this is him. Now I read maybe you say you read this even before hold your peace and listen to the word of God. Even if you are sick, you know divine healing. &gt;&gt; Divine healing. &gt;&gt; If you come in here and you are sick, &gt;&gt; just accept the word of God. Amen. [Music] by his stripes we were. &gt;&gt; So you take the word of God and all other things will take their places. [Music] But one time &gt;&gt; there was this woman Some people believe that he became a pastor but not the [Music] part &gt;&gt; the Lord said &gt;&gt; okay I'll start here &gt;&gt; woman believe me The hour cometh. &gt;&gt; The hour cometh neither in this mountain yet worship their father. &gt;&gt; You worship you know not what the Bible said in those days was for the Jews. Our cometh And now is when the true worshippers that means there some false worship &gt;&gt; shall worship the father in spirit and in truth. For the father seeketh such to worship him. So God is a spirit. And they that worship him worship him. [Music] &gt;&gt; And now you must recognize this in spirit. &gt;&gt; And if you come in, &gt;&gt; then we say number one. &gt;&gt; Number one. [Music] We must look at this superal stood there. There was fire wind. &gt;&gt; He was just in the cave there. and the steal out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was this wind &gt;&gt; earthquake &gt;&gt; earthquakes until there was a small voice and he walked out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Elijah stood there. &gt;&gt; You know how they prayed in dance, &gt;&gt; cut themselves. Elijah was Elijah was waiting for the right time. manifestation. He was waiting for a manifestation just so [Music] &gt;&gt; that's why these people they used to go into the synagogue [Music] and what happened they remain there looking for a manifestation &gt;&gt; manifestation until they said &gt;&gt; we have &gt;&gt; found him. &gt;&gt; So Elijah, &gt;&gt; he was not just taken by any of those stood there waiting for them. After that he said they were tired and he said carry on maybe somewhereing or what But the Bible says at the evening time [Music] of the sacrifice of the times in the time of the sacrifice he stood up and said you have prayed. You've done all your things. Now this is time to come on the scene. He started the altar and the water set up because he said to them, "We make altars here and put no fire. No fire. Keep your boxes away." Why? &gt;&gt; Because It was supposed to be the fire of God. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know, you know that God refused what happened from God. refused to bear the sacrifice of because it was according to his works. So Elijah stood there and said don't put fire to the sacrifice and the Bible says the fire came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he knew the time &gt;&gt; and he knew God. [Music] &gt;&gt; This woman God speaking to a woman. Don't look down to the doctors of God. You know I like this. This woman was a prostitute, &gt;&gt; you know, a prostitute &gt;&gt; would go out in her shorts so exposing her body. That's a prostitute &gt;&gt; standing there changing some, you know, positions. People would be passing by and calling some names. But one day the beginning came. &gt;&gt; The one who knew everything from the beginning [Music] was the beginning of God. This was the beginning of the unfolding of God. [Music] We're trying to show it. We are still coming back to that father, son, holy ghost. Three persons but three dispensations. [Music] That's why Jesus said I am &gt;&gt; this I am &gt;&gt; I am. was in the beginning the word. &gt;&gt; Now here he met this woman. &gt;&gt; I wish you could meet him one day. I &gt;&gt; met this woman. &gt;&gt; She came there to the world, &gt;&gt; you know, with pencil heels and so forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and mercy was standing there by the way of grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You cannot exhaust this grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even a thief on the cross. Lord remember [Music] this night. I'll be with you in paradise of grace. &gt;&gt; Even those who pierce still father them &gt;&gt; they don't know what they do full of grace. &gt;&gt; So they met then he said they can I read this last part. God bless you for that. The woman said unto him, &gt;&gt; I know that Messiah coming about it was taught in the church. So I know Messiah who is called Christ. When he is come, &gt;&gt; he will tell us of he will tell us all things. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close because I can feel it now. &gt;&gt; When he is come now remember when he come &gt;&gt; he will tell us.
