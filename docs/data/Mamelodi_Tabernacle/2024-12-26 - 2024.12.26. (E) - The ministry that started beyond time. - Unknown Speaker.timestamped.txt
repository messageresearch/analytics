[3:23:13] angel that came with the seventh SE

[3:23:34] everybody did you hear him speaking
[3:23:38] about the
[3:23:40] flying
[3:23:43] interpretation flying is speaking of as
[3:23:45] an angel
[3:23:52] that the seven SE is so
[3:23:57] special he received
[3:23:59] it from an
[3:24:02] angel now he calls it the
[3:24:06] flying
[3:24:12] interpretation he brother sister the FL
[3:24:19] [Applause]
[3:24:21] interpretation amen that's what
[3:24:26] brother and we that the
[3:24:31] s that
[3:24:35] came
[3:24:39] flying
[3:24:45] hey what great
[3:24:51] mystery
[3:24:53] uh I don't know the brothers we had a
[3:24:56] book with
[3:24:59] us I don't know what happened to
[3:25:08] my uh either it's in the
[3:25:13] car not in the car
[3:25:16] I don't know in the back or what but we
[3:25:19] had we came with the
[3:25:24] book find in the check in the in my
[3:25:33] back I don't know what
[3:25:36] happened but we had it in the
[3:25:40] car amen all right amen
[3:25:46] or let me just
[3:25:51] quote even
[3:25:57] if brother
[3:26:00] uh the title I am still I'm I'm myself
[3:26:06] I'm searching for the
[3:26:11] title but let me quote to you something
[3:26:17] brother Brenham speaks about the
[3:26:21] seventh brother Brenham speaks about the
[3:26:28] seventh I just wonder why we had the
[3:26:35] book
[3:26:37] and let me check first
[3:26:44] before let me not surrender
[3:26:49] all right
[3:26:51] anyhow we talking about something
[3:26:57] here in that
[3:27:00] book it speaks
[3:27:03] of the
[3:27:05] seven where brother
[3:27:10] Bram when he arrived at the seventh he
[3:27:17] [Music]
[3:27:20] what they saying that is in the
[3:27:23] book he
[3:27:25] stopped at the
[3:27:29] seven because it
[3:27:31] says God stopped
[3:27:37] there
[3:27:39] because that is Revelation chapter
[3:27:44] 7 the
[3:27:47] seven he
[3:27:50] stopped at the
[3:27:52] seven now there's a reason why
[3:27:58] he because in that that book it says
[3:28:02] because he
[3:28:05] arrived at his own
[3:28:12] image that's why we have the seventh
[3:28:14] angel messenger
[3:28:17] it can't be the
[3:28:20] sixth seven now the Revelation says when
[3:28:25] he
[3:28:26] opened the
[3:28:28] servant he stopped
[3:28:32] there now in that book it says why he
[3:28:37] stopped it is
[3:28:39] because he arrived at his own image
[3:28:46] now we have the seventh
[3:28:49] messenger when he arrived at the
[3:28:52] seventh when he open
[3:29:02] the what
[3:29:04] how how does he put
[3:29:08] it in
[3:29:09] the in the book Revelation I mean the
[3:29:14] the S book
[3:29:17] even in
[3:29:20] Genesis it says let us make
[3:29:24] men in our
[3:29:31] image so that book I I wonder what
[3:29:35] happened to
[3:29:37] that but when he
[3:29:39] arrived at the
[3:29:41] S he
[3:29:43] stopped now the book says
[3:29:48] because he arrived at his own
[3:29:55] image that's why we have the seventh
[3:29:58] angel
[3:30:03] messenger you cannot receive the
[3:30:06] revelation of
[3:30:09] God from any other
[3:30:13] person but it should be the seven
[3:30:20] amen that's what is written in that
[3:30:25] book is two books that got
[3:30:31] when now looking
[3:30:34] today we are so
[3:30:39] blessed the seventh
[3:30:43] seal now the seventh seal not just as a
[3:30:50] quotation you have not received a
[3:30:55] quotation you have received the seventh
[3:31:04] seal where is it from
[3:31:08] brother
[3:31:10] [Applause]
[3:31:14] oh are you sure it's from the
[3:31:20] library okay
[3:31:22] amen God page
[3:31:25] 10 God wanted to make a man after his
[3:31:36] image God don't want
[3:31:40] something different from who he is
[3:31:47] am that's why he said let us make men in
[3:31:52] our
[3:31:57] image so the bride of Christ is in the
[3:32:01] image
[3:32:04] of let me
[3:32:06] read I'm
[3:32:08] closing God wanted to make a
[3:32:13] man after his
[3:32:17] meaning he looked at
[3:32:20] himself amen am and he was
[3:32:25] pleased about this
[3:32:29] image so that's
[3:32:32] why the first
[3:32:35] thing in his
[3:32:37] mind he wanted to make gods
[3:32:46] brother bam
[3:32:48] says in the book Blasphemous
[3:32:52] name he says the sons of
[3:32:55] God will be
[3:32:59] Gods because God is worshiped by the
[3:33:04] gods as he said let us make men in
[3:33:10] our
[3:33:12] image if we are if I am
[3:33:16] God let them be
[3:33:20] God God is worshiped by the
[3:33:24] god
[3:33:27] amen amen amen now I
[3:33:31] quote God wanted to make
[3:33:35] men after his
[3:33:38] image the great is it sculptor
[3:33:43] yes he went to work on
[3:33:49] him a Man In
[3:33:53] His
[3:33:55] Image he couldn't think of any other
[3:33:58] kind of
[3:34:03] creature if then he regards himself as
[3:34:09] God now in
[3:34:13] order to make men
[3:34:16] it should only be in His
[3:34:20] image not another kind of
[3:34:23] man not a giant not a
[3:34:27] what but let us make men in our
[3:34:32] image this is what he said and we are
[3:34:36] all seated here but we should be in the
[3:34:39] image
[3:34:41] [Applause]
[3:34:44] of that's right
[3:34:47] says the great
[3:34:49] sculptor he went to work on
[3:34:53] him and we
[3:34:56] notice as he brought up from the
[3:35:01] materials perhaps the
[3:35:04] fish then the
[3:35:06] beds he was he was coming to his
[3:35:10] image then the creeping things upon the
[3:35:14] Earth
[3:35:16] and many
[3:35:18] things that he brought but all this time
[3:35:23] he was coming to
[3:35:27] his To His
[3:35:29] Image none of the things before the
[3:35:35] image could worship
[3:35:37] him or could be like
[3:35:41] him that's why he started like that
[3:35:46] mind Was His
[3:35:50] [Applause]
[3:35:52] Image amen things couldn't be like
[3:35:58] him he was the sculptor of Eternal
[3:36:04] things let me come to
[3:36:08] this and the scor that could
[3:36:13] create and bring
[3:36:16] into
[3:36:18] existence that which he has in his
[3:36:24] mind let me
[3:36:28] finish he began to work upon the scripp
[3:36:34] things little
[3:36:38] animals but
[3:36:41] finally he brought it into larger
[3:36:44] animals
[3:36:47] such as the lion TIG
[3:36:50] bear amen you know you you read these
[3:36:54] things but I'm coming to this one but
[3:37:00] finally there Came
[3:37:03] Upon there came forth upon the
[3:37:07] earth a
[3:37:12] Perfection that's why he says be ye
[3:37:14] therefore
[3:37:17] perfect as I am
[3:37:22] perfect nothing imperfect can worship
[3:37:31] God right amen what is you know
[3:37:35] something that is
[3:37:38] imperfect the young people are are ruled
[3:37:42] by
[3:37:43] the cell phone
[3:37:52] every time when where they
[3:37:54] are cell
[3:37:58] phone that's what in in their
[3:38:04] mind all right
[3:38:07] amen and they come to
[3:38:12] church with cell phones ready to open in
[3:38:16] their
[3:38:17] [Music]
[3:38:21] pockets I've got cellone not even not
[3:38:26] one but I'm not ruled by a cell
[3:38:30] phone to phone
[3:38:32] you I will use my cell
[3:38:35] phone M but the young people they don't
[3:38:40] use it for
[3:38:43] that you check the pH photos in their
[3:38:46] cell
[3:38:50] pH young men say
[3:38:57] Amen you check their cell
[3:39:00] phones they are here with their cell
[3:39:03] phones with
[3:39:07] girls you know what
[3:39:11] else
[3:39:13] can a person
[3:39:16] with the cell
[3:39:18] phone and girls in the cell phone go in
[3:39:22] the
[3:39:26] rupture which
[3:39:29] Rapture can you be raptured with a cell
[3:39:31] phone full of
[3:39:37] girls young
[3:39:40] men young
[3:39:42] women you don't know God
[3:39:48] let me I'm not attacking I'm
[3:39:52] preaching now
[3:39:55] listen when God
[3:39:57] was
[3:40:02] thinking then he wanted a
[3:40:07] worshiper to be in his own
[3:40:11] image you know to be worshiped
[3:40:15] by his own
[3:40:21] image now that's why this book
[3:40:24] Masterpiece it says but
[3:40:27] finally they came forth upon the
[3:40:30] earth a
[3:40:35] Perfection that's why the seventh
[3:40:40] SE and that was a man
[3:40:50] and and then he could see in that man
[3:40:56] that it looked like
[3:41:00] [Applause]
[3:41:05] him he didn't look at the suit of the
[3:41:07] young man of that
[3:41:11] man but he
[3:41:13] looked where
[3:41:19] in because the real person is
[3:41:27] in if you see somebody
[3:41:31] smoking
[3:41:32] and worshiping cell
[3:41:36] phone you know that that's what is in
[3:41:45] all right
[3:41:47] amen somebody phed
[3:41:50] me and
[3:41:53] said it was not a phone call it was a
[3:41:57] type of
[3:42:00] communication he
[3:42:03] said how are you going to help
[3:42:08] us in the
[3:42:11] Rapture I said no I
[3:42:16] it is God who's going to Rapture
[3:42:21] us me I can just
[3:42:23] preach Rapture to
[3:42:28] you
[3:42:30] okay then he
[3:42:34] said but Satan
[3:42:38] says he is planning something for
[3:42:44] us because God has planned for us the
[3:42:48] Rapture Satan also has planned for his
[3:42:52] own
[3:42:57] people that
[3:43:02] liar and then he could see in that
[3:43:06] man that it looks like
[3:43:15] mean God has put a mirror in a
[3:43:22] man so that when he looks at that
[3:43:27] Mir he can see
[3:43:30] himself
[3:43:32] amen amen amen so that means in you
[3:43:37] inside of
[3:43:38] you there is a
[3:43:41] mirror when God wants to see himself
[3:43:45] he looks at
[3:43:47] you hallelujah praise
[3:43:52] God that's why he said let us make men
[3:43:56] in
[3:43:58] our
[3:44:01] image God don't use a mirror like we
[3:44:07] have this
[3:44:09] mirror it's your heart it's in
[3:44:13] you when he wants to see
[3:44:15] himself he looks at a
[3:44:19] brother and he can see himself
[3:44:23] inside that's why he said let us make
[3:44:26] men in our
[3:44:32] image the image he didn't mean that that
[3:44:37] person to look like a Zulu
[3:44:44] or was talking about the
[3:44:48] inside the inner
[3:44:52] man amen amen the Rapture is
[3:44:58] coming the Rapture is
[3:45:06] coming the
[3:45:10] socalled prophets in this world
[3:45:16] let me tell you something the Rapture is
[3:45:24] coming
[3:45:26] and those that are
[3:45:29] called prophets and so
[3:45:33] forth they can't even see
[3:45:39] that then they
[3:45:43] say no one knows
[3:45:45] when the rupture will take
[3:45:51] place they are
[3:45:56] right I can't give
[3:46:01] you that day the exact
[3:46:07] day no for the Bible
[3:46:12] says I am just waiting for the rapture
[3:46:16] but the
[3:46:17] Rapture is in
[3:46:22] [Applause]
[3:46:24] you amen
[3:46:28] amen you know
[3:46:30] sometimes you can't even
[3:46:35] sleep during the
[3:46:38] night you find
[3:46:41] yourself longing
[3:46:49] to see
[3:46:57] him
[3:47:01] why you are in His
[3:47:04] [Music]
[3:47:06] image and so
[3:47:10] for and sometimes
[3:47:15] not only when the people are
[3:47:18] singing even when you are
[3:47:22] alone there is that in a
[3:47:28] man
[3:47:33] singing
[3:47:34] oh I want to see I can't even
[3:47:41] sing sing singing a his face
[3:47:45] start
[3:47:50] [Music]
[3:47:52] it
[3:47:53] amen amen that's it
[3:47:57] amen if you have
[3:47:59] that it is because it is that man in
[3:48:02] your
[3:48:07] heart I I'm closing
[3:48:10] here and he could
[3:48:13] see in
[3:48:16] man that it looked like
[3:48:24] him what will he
[3:48:28] see when he
[3:48:31] looked in
[3:48:35] you but when he looked in that man it
[3:48:41] looked like him
[3:48:45] so now when he looked upon
[3:48:48] him he was a
[3:48:53] reflection of that of what his creator
[3:49:03] was you know he looked at
[3:49:07] Peter at C
[3:49:11] Philip and said who who do men say that
[3:49:16] I the son of man
[3:49:20] am now there
[3:49:22] at
[3:49:24] uh that place what did they
[3:49:27] say
[3:49:29] cilia
[3:49:31] Philippi because that
[3:49:34] place that's where they worship
[3:49:39] God
[3:49:41] sacrifices and there was one part
[3:49:45] which looks like a cave
[3:49:48] like and that one they they
[3:49:52] say is the gate to
[3:49:57] hell and there was some other
[3:50:01] places where they would worship their
[3:50:06] God amen
[3:50:08] amen now when he said to Peter
[3:50:14] seen it recently
[3:50:17] there he said who do men say I the son
[3:50:21] of men
[3:50:23] am they said well some
[3:50:30] say you know
[3:50:32] the and he said but who do you
[3:50:42] say and Peter said
[3:50:45] Thou Art the
[3:50:47] Christ son of the
[3:50:50] living and said Peter
[3:50:54] blood and
[3:50:56] flesh not revealed this to
[3:51:00] you but who
[3:51:06] has now I saw last
[3:51:09] time that where he asked this
[3:51:13] question they were standing
[3:51:16] before that H
[3:51:20] there that looked like
[3:51:25] um a
[3:51:28] cave and uh they call that
[3:51:32] place the Gate of
[3:51:37] Hell and the Lord
[3:51:40] said Peter said Thou Art Christ son of
[3:51:45] the Living God and the Lord
[3:51:48] said Peter Peter meaning little
[3:51:55] Stone flesh and blood has not revealed
[3:51:58] this to
[3:52:01] you but
[3:52:05] father what did the Lord say about
[3:52:12] the h
[3:52:17] I
[3:52:25] will the Gates of Hell shall never
[3:52:31] Prevail and before them there was that
[3:52:35] gate
[3:52:37] of and it's written there the Gate of
[3:52:46] all right
[3:52:48] amen and Peter meaning small
[3:52:54] rock and they were standing before that
[3:52:59] place where the
[3:53:01] Greeks the Romans they used to come
[3:53:05] there to worship their
[3:53:10] gods now in
[3:53:12] closing now he could
[3:53:15] see in that
[3:53:17] man that it looked like
[3:53:24] human so now when he looked upon
[3:53:27] him he was a
[3:53:31] reflection of what his creator
[3:53:36] [Music]
[3:53:38] was how would you
[3:53:42] like to see the Lord Jesus was looking
[3:53:45] at
[3:53:47] you in the manner that he looked at
[3:53:53] Peter Peter
[3:53:56] meaning small
[3:53:59] rock amen
[3:54:01] amen
[3:54:04] Peter Thou
[3:54:07] Art and Upon This
[3:54:10] Rock I will
[3:54:12] build my church
[3:54:15] and the Gates of
[3:54:18] Hell shall never
[3:54:22] Prevail
[3:54:25] hey it was not an apostle or a preacher
[3:54:29] who told Peter
[3:54:33] that you know I'm always longing to hear
[3:54:37] God saying something about me
[3:54:45] but then when we receive the
[3:54:48] message by the seventh angel
[3:54:52] messenger is then we
[3:54:55] willage to read about what God thinks
[3:54:59] about
[3:55:02] us amen the seventh angel
[3:55:07] messenger the
[3:55:08] message told us all
[3:55:13] things that message told me who I
[3:55:21] am it even tells
[3:55:24] you whether you are going in the Rapture
[3:55:27] or
[3:55:30] not because God don't just tell you
[3:55:35] something but he puts it in
[3:55:40] you your the coming rapture
[3:55:44] to you it's not on a piece of
[3:55:47] paper but he has put it in
[3:55:51] you that's why when you are
[3:55:54] walking you find tears running
[3:55:59] down and
[3:56:02] because you know there's a song in me
[3:56:08] always of
[3:56:11] how I will react
[3:56:16] when I shall see him face to
[3:56:22] face amen
[3:56:25] amen how many would want to see
[3:56:30] Jesus not just to hear about
[3:56:33] him but to see to behold his
[3:56:39] face is there something in you
[3:56:44] that wants to see
[3:56:48] him is it
[3:56:52] there while
[3:56:55] walking
[3:56:57] thinking that one
[3:57:01] day there will be
[3:57:04] [Applause]
[3:57:10] Rapture and you'll see him
[3:57:18] amen
[3:57:19] amen let me close with
[3:57:22] this then he could
[3:57:26] see what can God see in
[3:57:30] you in that
[3:57:32] man that it looked like
[3:57:38] him when he looked upon
[3:57:41] him he was a reflection
[3:57:45] of what his creator
[3:57:48] [Applause]
[3:57:51] was God had now been
[3:57:56] able to
[3:57:58] achieve the thing that he
