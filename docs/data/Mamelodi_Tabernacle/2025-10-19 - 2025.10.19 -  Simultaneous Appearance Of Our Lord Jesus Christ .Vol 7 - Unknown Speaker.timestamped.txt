[33:05] [Music]
[33:12] [Applause]
[33:20] [Music]
[33:26] Shall we bow our heads?
[33:29] Our most gracious heavenly father,
[33:33] the God who is and the God who is to
[33:35] come
[33:37] this morning. Father, we just want to
[33:39] thank you and running short of words to
[33:41] thank you.
[33:43] There's so much that you are doing for
[33:45] us. So much that you are doing for your
[33:46] bride
[33:48] this morning. Father, we just want to
[33:50] thank you for such a wonderful time in
[33:52] your presence.
[33:54] As father, the Bible says there was a
[33:56] tabernacle that was within the house
[34:00] and father it has to go out of the house
[34:04] and all people they need to follow that
[34:06] tabernacle.
[34:08] Baba, there's a tabernacle which is
[34:10] here. Lord all of us we came out from
[34:13] our different houses to come and
[34:16] gathered out ourselves here because we
[34:18] know that father we are going to meet
[34:21] our God. We are going to meet the king
[34:24] of king the king of Salem the sooncoming
[34:27] king. Thank you heavenly father as we
[34:30] have here father we have come to praise
[34:33] and to give glory and honor to the most
[34:36] high god. Father we have come gracious
[34:39] heavenly father some Lord they are sick
[34:42] some father they need their deliverance
[34:45] as long as they have entered into this
[34:47] place already the deliverance is upon
[34:50] their lives in the name of Jesus
[34:54] we like to thank you gracious heavenly
[34:56] father that lord there's a message that
[34:59] you have given unto us the message of
[35:02] the hour the message of the seven seed
[35:05] which is the power of the third pool And
[35:07] we can see the God of the message is
[35:10] always with us. He's always with the
[35:12] bride. In these times, difficult times,
[35:16] gracious heavenly father, you have said
[35:18] Lord that you will show yourself when
[35:22] the spirit of the enemy father comes.
[35:25] The Bible says you will lift up the
[35:27] standard because the God that we serve
[35:30] is a God who's looking after her wife
[35:34] which is the bride. We just want to
[35:36] command the devil that all your
[35:38] techniques,
[35:40] &gt;&gt; the God that we serve, he knows them
[35:42] &gt;&gt; and they will never work
[35:44] &gt;&gt; because the God that we serve is always
[35:47] watching over the bride in the name of
[35:50] the Lord Jesus Christ. We stand against
[35:53] you. We stand against your plans. We
[35:56] stand against anything that you have
[35:58] planned for this morning that it will
[36:01] never it will never and I say again it
[36:03] will never prosper because greater is he
[36:06] that is within us than the one which is
[36:09] in this world. We thank you gracious
[36:12] heavenly father to serve such a
[36:14] wonderful God. We can see father the
[36:17] time you have said that our time we must
[36:20] look at Israel. We say father what is
[36:23] happening and we are looking father that
[36:26] soon and very soon lord you will take us
[36:29] out of this world gracious heavenly
[36:32] father so that we can come at home where
[36:35] we are coming from we were predestinated
[36:38] we came from you were in your thoughts
[36:41] gracious heavenly father we came and
[36:43] bypass our theopani to be born in sin
[36:46] but we like to thank you father that
[36:49] lord the message of the hour has brought
[36:51] us into the position again and we just
[36:54] want to thank you Lord that our lives
[36:57] will never be the same again as long as
[37:00] we are in you. We pray father for the
[37:03] proceedings of the service Lord. Thank
[37:05] you father for the worship team that
[37:08] father has put everything together so
[37:11] that we can worship the lord. Father we
[37:13] also pray for the man of god who will be
[37:16] behind the pullpit. We pray that father
[37:19] let the power of the lord anoint him.
[37:22] Let it be father something that is
[37:24] coming from the heart of the lord that
[37:26] will be delivered to your bride this
[37:28] morning in the name of the lord Jesus
[37:30] Christ. We thank you father as we give
[37:32] you god all the glory and honor not
[37:35] forgotting to pray for our precious
[37:37] pastor Israel goa whom we love him so
[37:40] much gracious heavenly father who has
[37:42] dedicated all his life for the work of
[37:45] the lord. We thank you gracious heavenly
[37:47] father to have such a pastor in the name

[1:13:21] so much
[1:13:23] for sending such a message.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; We also have our elders from the US.
[1:13:33] We just want to say God bless our elder
[1:13:35] Raid Gapin.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; God bless our elder Raid Gerson. And God
[1:13:40] bless our elder Larry Mims.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; And God bless our elder Larry Mims.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; I know that our Elder Red, he sent some
[1:13:49] um greetings last week. Amen.
[1:13:55] So we love them a lot. Hallelujah.
[1:13:59] So as we continue,
[1:14:04] we've got our elder
[1:14:09] and the and their family and the family.
[1:14:14] They are saying that they would like to
[1:14:15] thank the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:19] in the ministry of the power of the
[1:14:20] thirdpool
[1:14:24] and our under the pastor Israel
[1:14:29] and the bride.
[1:14:32] So maybe to summarize this,
[1:14:37] our elder
[1:14:40] says to me they want to thank the Lord
[1:14:42] because there is a sister probably who
[1:14:46] park her car in their yard.
[1:14:54] So as she was driving the car
[1:14:59] just along the gate
[1:15:02] then the son of Baba Rato
[1:15:07] he came so that he can assist the sister
[1:15:09] to park the car in the right spot.
[1:15:14] So he had a key in his hand
[1:15:19] while he was trying to drive the car.
[1:15:24] Then there were thieves who were
[1:15:25] following the car.
[1:15:29] Probably they wanted to take that car.
[1:15:33] So they were struggling with the sun
[1:15:38] until they shot I think he was talking
[1:15:41] about nine bullets.
[1:15:45] But we like to thank the Lord
[1:15:48] that he was short.
[1:15:51] The son he was short
[1:15:54] but he is alive.
[1:15:58] Amen.
[1:15:59] [Applause]
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; So this is also a reminder brethren
[1:16:07] about our attire.
[1:16:12] We once announced about it.
[1:16:16] But it seems something is also
[1:16:18] happening.
[1:16:21] So this is just to remind our brethren
[1:16:26] that please brethren avoid wearing teis
[1:16:30] in the tabernacle of the Lord.
[1:16:37] Probably some of you or some of us we
[1:16:43] were those days when we are driving
[1:16:47] maybe you forget to change
[1:16:52] and take the right ones
[1:16:55] but probably you need to put the alarm
[1:16:57] maybe to remind you.
[1:17:01] Amen. Amen. So please let's avoid that.
[1:17:04] Brethren,
[1:17:06] we also want also to say
[1:17:10] those skinny jeans
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:15] and and the skinny trousers.
[1:17:19] Oh, please brothers
[1:17:22] because some of our brothers they take
[1:17:26] them to Taylor
[1:17:30] so that they can just put them to be
[1:17:36] but please don't come with those in the
[1:17:39] tabernacle.
[1:17:43] Are you okay?
[1:17:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; And also to our sisters,
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; please do not wear those short sleeves
[1:17:57] shirts
[1:18:02] or dresses
[1:18:05] or high heels.
[1:18:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We know we need
[1:18:11] to follow our church order, brother.
[1:18:16] We are in the house of the Lord.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Are we all happy?
[1:18:22] Amen.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:27] There's a request here
[1:18:36] requested
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; that we should announce this
[1:18:43] family is organizing a party for their
[1:18:47] father.
[1:18:52] Now this is is really a surprise to the
[1:18:55] father.
[1:18:58] But we'll bring it as it is
[1:19:01] because they know that his is live
[1:19:03] streaming.
[1:19:05] Hallelujah.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; So this party is organized by the by the
[1:19:09] children
[1:19:12] for their father
[1:19:14] and the date is going to be on the 28th
[1:19:17] of February 28th February 2026.
[1:19:21] 2026. So they want to make a big party
[1:19:27] where they want to slaughter a cow.
[1:19:32] So now
[1:19:34] brethren are also invited
[1:19:38] on this party.
[1:19:41] So God willing
[1:19:44] if we are still here.
[1:19:47] Hallelujah.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is the party
[1:19:51] from the family.
[1:19:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; So brethren, we are also requesting here
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; also. This is a reminder
[1:20:08] that um the announcement we I remember
[1:20:14] we set the time of 9:30
[1:20:21] that after 9:30 we are not going to be
[1:20:23] accepting new request.
[1:20:30] So the problem is
[1:20:33] we need to be in the house of the Lord
[1:20:39] by 9.
[1:20:42] We need to be here.
[1:20:44] So now there are requests that are
[1:20:47] coming late.
[1:20:51] So we are trying to extend the the grace
[1:20:54] to accept them
[1:20:58] but that is not okay
[1:21:01] because the pastor is not happy about
[1:21:03] that.
[1:21:05] So I have requested the elders
[1:21:09] that is it possible that if maybe we can
[1:21:11] put the time to past 9
[1:21:17] so that
[1:21:19] we close
[1:21:23] the 15 minutes
[1:21:26] we'll try just to finish up everything
[1:21:29] so that at 9:30 we should be also in the
[1:21:31] house of the Lord.
[1:21:35] Are we happy about that?
[1:21:38] Hallelujah.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; So I just want to extend my apology from
[1:21:42] the pastor
[1:21:47] that we need to do the right thing
[1:21:50] and follow the church order.
[1:21:54] The church order is not for you only
[1:21:57] but as well as us as elders and deacons.
[1:22:02] We also need to follow the church order.
[1:22:06] God bless you.
[1:22:08] Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; So this morning
[1:22:12] we are happy to announce that our
[1:22:15] brother Mara will be coming back in the
[1:22:17] pullpit
[1:22:21] to give us the word for today.
[1:22:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; So as the pastor has assigned
[1:22:31] We are happy.
[1:22:34] God bless you all.
[1:22:36] As we all stand up
[1:22:38] and sing our song
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; to welcome our precious brother.
[1:22:44] Hallelujah.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Of the voice
[1:22:51] of the

[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:25:22] Christ,
[1:25:25] thanking him for everything
[1:25:28] for us.
[1:25:30] Amen.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I've got the greetings from
[1:25:34] the pastor once more this morning.
[1:25:38] He says, "Shalom." Shalom.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; And uh he told me that,
[1:25:47] "The Lord willing." Always the pastor
[1:25:50] says, "The Lord willing."
[1:25:53] The Lord willing,
[1:25:56] within a week or so,
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; he will be here.
[1:26:02] Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Uh he said when you see pastor Magua
[1:26:09] coming
[1:26:11] he will be there as well.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; To see the church.
[1:26:18] How were you doing
[1:26:23] physical handshake?
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Because he love you so much.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; So that's the message I got from him.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; We believe
[1:26:37] the Lord will.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; So we thank God for everything.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Even myself this morning.
[1:26:48] I thank God
[1:26:51] because I think I I achieved
[1:26:57] what I wanted to achieve.
[1:27:00] in terms of the series of the messages
[1:27:02] that I was preaching
[1:27:05] because today
[1:27:07] is the last sermon
[1:27:10] of the series I wanted to bring to the
[1:27:13] church
[1:27:15] because we will talk about eternity.
[1:27:18] We'll talk about the new city,
[1:27:21] the new Jerusalem.
[1:27:23] you know, back there.
[1:27:26] Uh, we're talking about the current
[1:27:28] situation,
[1:27:31] the rapture,
[1:27:34] and tribulation,
[1:27:37] the battle of Armageddon,
[1:27:39] the millennium,
[1:27:43] white throne, judgment,
[1:27:45] and now is the final stage,
[1:27:51] the new heaven and the new earth.
[1:27:55] is eternity.
[1:27:56] That's what I'm going to talk about this
[1:27:58] morning.
[1:28:00] And I want to ask prayers also from the
[1:28:03] child of God.
[1:28:06] You must just pray for me and for my
[1:28:09] family as well because
[1:28:12] tomorrow
[1:28:14] I'll be going on exile.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will see you during the
[1:28:22] convention.
[1:28:24] So I'll be in Zambia
[1:28:27] on business
[1:28:29] then I will come back again. We will be
[1:28:32] together again.
[1:28:34] So just be with me in prayer
[1:28:37] and pray for you as well. I've shared
[1:28:40] this with the pastor as well. And one
[1:28:43] thing we agreed on
[1:28:46] is to baptize the people in Zambia.
[1:28:50] So I believe
[1:28:53] you will have a sister church there
[1:28:57] myself the only best thing I can do
[1:29:02] is just to tell the people about Lord
[1:29:04] Jesus Christ
[1:29:06] if they believe they believe because
[1:29:10] this message is for them that believe to
[1:29:13] believe it.
[1:29:17] So our God is a good planner.
[1:29:23] As human beings, we might be
[1:29:26] shortsighted on certain things,
[1:29:30] but God knows better.
[1:29:33] I'm one person that I said even
[1:29:35] previously.
[1:29:38] I I'm one person
[1:29:41] who even said it previously
[1:29:45] that I'm always on a relaxation mode
[1:29:50] because I know everything that happened
[1:29:55] in my life. God knows about it.
[1:29:59] There was never a mistake.
[1:30:03] If you think anything that happens to
[1:30:06] your life,
[1:30:08] it's a mistake or you could have done
[1:30:10] better,
[1:30:12] think twice.
[1:30:15] God planned everything for a reason.
[1:30:21] So as a child of God, relax.
[1:30:25] Well, relax is not a problem
[1:30:30] because when you relax,
[1:30:33] you think sober.
[1:30:38] When you are angry,
[1:30:41] emotional,
[1:30:44] you regret later
[1:30:46] for what you have uttered.
[1:30:49] So saints,
[1:30:51] relax in the Lord.
[1:30:54] Amen.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; God has done all.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; I was just greeting you by so saying
[1:31:04] may God richly bless you. We are going
[1:31:07] to read the scripture
[1:31:10] in Revelation chapter 31 I mean 21
[1:31:14] verse 1 and three.

[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; We just thank you Lord once more Lord.
[1:37:15] We are praying for our pastor.
[1:37:20] We love you him so much.
[1:37:25] He's your servant.
[1:37:27] Amen.
[1:37:34] Amen.
[1:37:37] [Music]
[1:37:43] Hallelujah.
[1:37:45] Yes, Lord.
[1:37:59] Lord,
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:01] [Applause]
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; we are very much thankful.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Let's read from the Bible.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; We're reading from Revelation chapter
[1:38:13] 21.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; From verse 1 to3.
[1:38:17] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[1:38:20] For the first heaven and the first earth
[1:38:22] were passed away, and there was no more
[1:38:24] sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, New
[1:38:28] Jerusalem, coming down from God out of
[1:38:30] heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:38:33] her husband.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; And I heard a great voice out of heaven,
[1:38:37] saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is
[1:38:40] with me.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; And he will dwell with them, and they
[1:38:44] shall be his people, and God himself
[1:38:46] shall be with them, and be their God.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. We may be seated.
[1:38:56] When our elder is praying,
[1:39:00] remind me of the message I was listening
[1:39:02] yesterday.
[1:39:05] The pastor was preaching about the two
[1:39:07] seats.
[1:39:10] So I was listening to that message.
[1:39:13] Then in that message he said
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Joshua
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Joshua
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; couldn't be by God couldn't be by God
[1:39:30] as long as Moses is alive.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:34] The pastor was preaching and saying that
[1:39:38] as long as Moses said,
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; God will talk to Moses.
[1:39:45] Then he go further and say, "Don't try
[1:39:48] anything.
[1:39:50] As long as I'm still alive,
[1:39:53] hear me."
[1:39:56] So I said, "Amen." Amen. So let's just
[1:40:01] leave lift
[1:40:03] pastor's hands.
[1:40:06] He's there.
[1:40:09] God will speak to him.
[1:40:12] Pastor will influence us
[1:40:16] and we will preach the message.
[1:40:20] Amen. Amen. Here
[1:40:23] it speaks about the new heaven,
[1:40:26] the new earth, the first heaven and the
[1:40:29] first earth.
[1:40:34] There's a holy city
[1:40:36] and there's a new Jerusalem.
[1:40:39] So what I'm going to talk about today,
[1:40:42] who will be in that new seat?
[1:40:49] Amen. Amen. is my message today.
[1:40:54] God richly bless you.
[1:40:57] Now I read from the future home.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; The man of God says, "The new city
[1:41:06] and the new earth,
[1:41:08] the new creation,
[1:41:10] the new city on the hill
[1:41:13] with the throne in the top of it."
[1:41:19] Amen. Amen.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; The throne is up there
[1:41:23] and there are dwellers
[1:41:26] all up and down on this mountain.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; And the walls that's around this
[1:41:38] had 12 foundations.
[1:41:42] Each one of them
[1:41:44] had the stone
[1:41:47] was in or the the breast stone that was
[1:41:50] in Aaron
[1:41:53] which represented the 12 tribes of
[1:41:56] Israel.
[1:42:01] And in the gates,
[1:42:04] they had four gates
[1:42:07] set exactly like the temple in the
[1:42:11] wilderness,
[1:42:15] like the tent that was in the
[1:42:17] wilderness.
[1:42:19] Notice each one
[1:42:22] had the apostle.
[1:42:25] Three each side
[1:42:30] apostle
[1:42:32] And it was 144 cub high
[1:42:36] 144 cub.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; 144
[1:42:40] cub is exactly 246 ft.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; 144
[1:42:47] 164 ft
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; making each one of those big stone
[1:42:50] almost 20T longt.
[1:42:56] The breastplate in that gate breastplate
[1:43:01] making up that wall that was around the
[1:43:04] sea.
[1:43:07] That is the new Jerusalem.
[1:43:09] If I can see my first light.
[1:43:15] Amen.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:19] God said to Moses the other day,
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; "Make the tabernacle
[1:43:26] as I've shown you in heaven.
[1:43:31] That means there was a tabernacle in
[1:43:34] heaven
[1:43:35] and God took it put down here and he
[1:43:40] said to Moses, "Do it here on this earth
[1:43:44] like the one I've shown you."
[1:43:47] So that means whatever Moses was doing
[1:43:52] he had influence
[1:43:54] from heaven.
[1:43:56] Whatever you are doing
[1:43:59] check if is the heavenly influence.
[1:44:04] Moses followed what heaven has told him.
[1:44:09] Look at the slide there.
[1:44:12] In those days
[1:44:15] there were 12 patriarchs.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; The 12 patriarchs
[1:44:23] being the son of Israel.
[1:44:27] They were 12.
[1:44:29] As 12 as they are became the foundation
[1:44:34] of what God has started.
[1:44:37] And as the time goes by,
[1:44:40] we see our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:43] having 12 disciples again.
[1:44:46] So it was a pattern
[1:44:49] of 12
[1:44:51] from heaven going to the Old Testament.
[1:44:54] We see the pattern of 12 from Old
[1:44:57] Testament
[1:45:00] to the New Testament.
[1:45:02] So 12 + 12
[1:45:06] And when you get to the book of
[1:45:09] Revelation,
[1:45:11] you find the 12
[1:45:14] patriarchs
[1:45:15] and the 12 disciples
[1:45:19] to make 24
[1:45:22] elders.
[1:45:25] Amen. That means to begin with
[1:45:29] 24 elders and to end with
[1:45:34] is 24 elders.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If God starts something,
[1:45:42] he will finish it exactly the way.
[1:45:47] Can you see that?
[1:45:49] The very same pattern
[1:45:52] that we have is the very same pattern
[1:45:56] that was there.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; You cannot minus or deduct
[1:46:02] or add. It happened exactly.
[1:46:07] When you look at that pattern
[1:46:10] the 24 elders
[1:46:12] there are a lot of activities
[1:46:16] that happens there. So we'll go and
[1:46:19] check what are those.
[1:46:21] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; When you look at that
[1:46:26] the east,
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; the west, the north and the south.
[1:46:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; There are 12 patriarchs.
[1:46:37] But in between, right in the middle of
[1:46:41] east, west, south,
[1:46:45] we found the Levites,
[1:46:48] the chosen ones that will serve
[1:46:52] the rest of them.
[1:46:54] And the Bible says that is the pattern
[1:46:59] that Moses got it from God.
[1:47:02] And then you go into the New Testament.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Second slide,
[1:47:09] you will realize that the 12
[1:47:13] apostle or the 12 disciples
[1:47:16] they are in the east,
[1:47:19] the west, north and south. They are
[1:47:23] there protecting something
[1:47:27] that should be in the middle.
[1:47:30] Right there in the middle, we see the
[1:47:33] book of acts.
[1:47:36] But brother Brennham says it's not the
[1:47:39] book of acts
[1:47:41] is the book of the holy ghost
[1:47:45] is the holy ghost in action.
[1:47:50] The holy ghost in the saints.
[1:47:53] And when you look at there, it is the
[1:47:56] beginning of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:00] That's where the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:48:03] started his bride,
[1:48:06] right in the middle. When you are
[1:48:08] protected
[1:48:10] by the gospel
[1:48:13] of the disciples of Jesus
[1:48:16] Christ, you are protected.
[1:48:19] God has done that.
[1:48:22] before the foundation of
[1:48:25] what are you scared of today?
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says there in the
[1:48:35] middle is us
[1:48:40] there in the middle in the Old Testament
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; is the Levites
[1:48:47] there in the New Testament
[1:48:50] is us. Then he started building his
[1:48:53] pride
[1:48:54] until when you get to eternity.
[1:48:58] Also look in the middle
[1:49:01] that's where the attraction is
[1:49:04] in the eternity. When you look in the
[1:49:06] middle
[1:49:10] is the bride is that chosen woman. You
[1:49:14] were chosen by God before the foundation
[1:49:17] of the world, irrespective of the
[1:49:20] condition.
[1:49:22] That's why when you love a woman, you
[1:49:25] love her unconditional
[1:49:30] once you put condition
[1:49:36] to the court
[1:49:38] for divorces.
[1:49:42] Amen.
[1:49:43] And in the gates, they had four gates
[1:49:47] set just exactly like the temple in the
[1:49:51] wilderness.
[1:49:55] Notice each one
[1:49:57] of the apostle
[1:49:59] each.
[1:50:01] Now on the east when you find the
[1:50:06] patriarchs three of them you find the
[1:50:11] disciples three of them east west
[1:50:18] why there's something important
[1:50:21] they protecting there
[1:50:24] but they do not protect
[1:50:26] because there is harm in the word of God
[1:50:30] there's no harm
[1:50:31] is the pattern that God once
[1:50:36] us to worship him to edify his name
[1:50:41] because God is God of all.
[1:50:45] Amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Now the city
[1:50:50] length
[1:50:52] by breath by height is the same
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; 1500 miles.
[1:51:00] 1500 miles
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; and brother Brennham says how many were
[1:51:03] there when I preach about that seed
[1:51:07] and I measured the seat
[1:51:11] he was there
[1:51:15] measuring the seed
[1:51:18] gave us the report
[1:51:20] he said I was there measuring it
[1:51:26] look at brother Bren he said the only
[1:51:29] person that can measure the seed
[1:51:33] himself
[1:51:35] person that can reveal the seal unto the
[1:51:37] people
[1:51:40] God himself.
[1:51:41] But we see a man who was born a woman
[1:51:47] and a man opening the seals for God
[1:51:51] and John worship him. Brother Brenham
[1:51:54] said I'm one of you
[1:51:58] and worship me. The word of God come to
[1:52:02] a place whereby the people who love to
[1:52:06] worship you because when they see the
[1:52:10] characteristics of
[1:52:12] are in you
[1:52:15] but a man will say let's worship God
[1:52:19] don't worship me.
[1:52:22] It will go there until they say you make
[1:52:26] yourself God. Even if you don't, but
[1:52:30] they look at you and they see God. The
[1:52:34] reason why they killed Jesus Christ, it
[1:52:37] was for this reason. You being a man,
[1:52:42] make yourself go.
[1:52:45] Brothers and sisters, you are a man. And
[1:52:48] the people will say, you will make
[1:52:50] yourself go.
[1:52:52] Because why? They see God in you.
[1:52:56] They won't say to a woman, "But you make
[1:53:00] yourself God." There's no
[1:53:02] characteristics of God there. But the
[1:53:05] worippers, they will say they make
[1:53:08] themselves God. Because they see the
[1:53:11] characteristics
[1:53:14] just keep on going on the line.
[1:53:18] The people will make you honest.
[1:53:23] Amen. Amen.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Because one was saying
[1:53:27] they they will hate you because the
[1:53:30] demons in them
[1:53:34] irritate.
[1:53:38] [Applause]
[1:53:39] Amen.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that kingdom
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; in the days of those kingdom
[1:53:49] there were Gentiles kingdom.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And even today is Gentiles
[1:53:56] kingdom.
[1:53:58] They they have started and they will
[1:54:01] come to an end. Those kingdoms
[1:54:07] the kingdom that the kingdom that will
[1:54:10] stand
[1:54:12] is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:16] that will stand
[1:54:18] eternally. That is why this morning I'm
[1:54:21] speaking about eternity.
[1:54:24] Rapture is time. Millennium
[1:54:28] is time. White throne judgment
[1:54:32] is time. We are still in time. But once
[1:54:36] we pass
[1:54:38] the white throne judgment,
[1:54:40] we enter into eternity.
[1:54:43] There's no more time.
[1:54:46] We are in eternity.
[1:54:48] And that's what we are talking about
[1:54:49] today.
[1:54:51] When we get there, it's eternity.
[1:54:55] But I thank God
[1:54:57] this
[1:54:59] already.
[1:55:01] Those that belongs to God are of God.
[1:55:05] They will be of God. They shall be with
[1:55:07] God eternally.
[1:55:10] For God said to Moses, "Do this because
[1:55:13] of what I show you."
[1:55:17] He It was there already in heaven. Just
[1:55:20] do it as I showed you in because God
[1:55:25] opened heaven and show Moses.
[1:55:29] God open heaven and show it to brother
[1:55:33] Brandon. When brother Brenham come and
[1:55:36] tell you that I saw you there
[1:55:42] because God showed him who the bride is
[1:55:48] even saying one was trying to take an
[1:55:50] offer
[1:55:53] but the man of God says come back to the
[1:55:56] life
[1:56:00] if we take off let's come back to their
[1:56:04] life.
[1:56:07] Brother Brenham saw us there.
[1:56:11] If
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; saw you there and you are quite sure,
[1:56:16] whatever you're doing, you do it looking
[1:56:20] there.
[1:56:22] For Moses was told by God, do it as I
[1:56:28] show you
[1:56:29] there. Live a life that belongs to you
[1:56:35] as you were that person.
[1:56:42] Don't start a new thing.
[1:56:45] Amen. Amen. Live according to the way
[1:56:48] you pray.
[1:56:52] The bride of Jesus Christ being us never
[1:56:56] started here.
[1:56:58] This is the manifestation
[1:57:01] or the vindication
[1:57:04] of who we were.
[1:57:09] Amen. Amen. If we were of God, we will
[1:57:13] remain of God, nothing here on earth
[1:57:18] will shift us.
[1:57:24] If someone
[1:57:26] has a reason to backslide
[1:57:29] is for him
[1:57:31] but nothing can separate us from the
[1:57:36] love of God.
[1:57:39] We continue now because
[1:57:43] that is in a shape.
[1:57:46] See what I've got this shape here like
[1:57:49] the pyramid.
[1:57:53] The arising of the saints
[1:57:57] make the march into glory.
[1:58:02] Do you understand it? Now Christ is the
[1:58:05] headstone,
[1:58:08] the rejected stone,
[1:58:11] the allseen eye
[1:58:14] coming exactly like the Bible.
[1:58:18] Daniel said he watched this gentile age
[1:58:25] until the stone come out of the mountain
[1:58:29] that wasn't cut with hands.
[1:58:32] They had never put a capstone on that
[1:58:35] pyramid.
[1:58:38] Wasn't cut by man's hand.
[1:58:42] Is God's hand that cut the stone?
[1:58:46] You see it?
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; It hit right the image on the feet
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; and it broke into pieces.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Grounded to powder.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; What happened that time?
[1:59:04] coming of that stone
[1:59:07] up went the church into glory
[1:59:11] at the rapture because it ended the
[1:59:13] gentile dispensation.
[1:59:16] God ended it up
[1:59:19] the coming of
[1:59:22] Amen.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; We can try to accumulate
[1:59:28] everything of this world but the man of
[1:59:32] God says anything what you see with an
[1:59:37] because at the beginning it will has an
[1:59:39] end.
[1:59:41] Amen.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; So now as the children of God we will
[1:59:45] look beyond
[1:59:47] what we can see with the
[1:59:50] if you can look beyond
[1:59:53] you are more than a conqueror
[1:59:56] is what God needs. Now you've got the
[1:59:59] city. You've got the city. It's a holy
[2:00:03] mountain. The city is a mountain.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing shall hurt or destroy
[2:00:14] in all my holy mountain.
[2:00:19] The city is not a cubed.
[2:00:23] It's a mountain.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; The width
[2:00:29] breath,
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; height, length, everything equal.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; That city is where we are longing to be.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Do you know the story of a frog
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; that won the race?
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; It was there were frogs going up.
[2:00:59] When they are up there, the other one
[2:01:02] just go up.
[2:01:06] The others were discouraging.
[2:01:08] They think he's going to die and they
[2:01:10] were thinking about it. The others
[2:01:13] looked down and they fell. When they
[2:01:16] tried to check how did this frog manage
[2:01:20] to win the race, they realized that
[2:01:24] the frog was deaf.
[2:01:30] What they said to the frog,
[2:01:33] what they said to the frog,
[2:01:36] you start here, you finish there and the
[2:01:39] frog goes. What the people said outside
[2:01:43] the frog doesn't hear
[2:01:46] looking at the
[2:01:48] finishing point.
[2:01:51] Brothers and sisters, a Christian
[2:01:53] journey
[2:01:55] is not an easy journey. Brother saying
[2:01:59] we are not sleeping in a flowery bed.
[2:02:04] Go up.
[2:02:06] Go up. When you are going up, the people
[2:02:09] discouraged.
[2:02:10] Go up. When the people try to stop you,
[2:02:14] go up because the point is the new city.
[2:02:19] That's where we want to go. But as we
[2:02:22] go, there will be discouragement along
[2:02:25] the way. There will be bad mouthing
[2:02:27] along the way. There will be challenges
[2:02:30] along the way. But close your ears
[2:02:35] up.
[2:02:38] Amen. Amen.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; In the Christian community,
[2:02:44] we need genian Christians.
[2:02:47] For the Bible says Joshua and Caleb
[2:02:52] being part of Israel, but they had
[2:02:55] another spirit.
[2:02:58] We need a church today that will have
[2:03:01] another spirit like Joshua and Ka
[2:03:06] when they go and spy in Ka. The other 10
[2:03:11] came back with different report.
[2:03:15] Joshua and Caleb,
[2:03:18] come back and say as the Lord says,
[2:03:22] we are going there. That is our place.
[2:03:26] We need such people today.
[2:03:30] We need people
[2:03:32] like Shedrach
[2:03:36] when I read about them in the Bible,
[2:03:40] they were young men
[2:03:42] and unmarried.
[2:03:44] But the men and the women that have been
[2:03:48] longing
[2:03:50] in Israel failed
[2:03:53] and worship the dragon.
[2:03:57] But the young men
[2:04:00] would rather die.
[2:04:02] We need them today.
[2:04:09] Men and women
[2:04:11] will compromise the gospel. So you young
[2:04:16] menel
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; stand up
[2:04:19] for this message.
[2:04:24] Amen.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; For there's a holy seat
[2:04:29] where we are going.
[2:04:31] No one should separate us from the love
[2:04:35] of God.
[2:04:38] You keep on moving and moving
[2:04:40] standing
[2:04:42] as you believe.
[2:04:45] Amen.
[2:04:47] Maybe
[2:04:49] they were standing next to the elderly
[2:04:52] people.
[2:05:01] But I will not worship
[2:05:04] the God of Babylon. Amen.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; God whom we worship
[2:05:11] is God of the individual
[2:05:15] [Applause]
[2:05:19] not God of the groups.
[2:05:24] Brother said so is God of the
[2:05:27] individual.
[2:05:30] If you have a group is your group
[2:05:34] but God is God of individual.
[2:05:43] I said the city
[2:05:46] will on to my opinion
[2:05:50] will be sitting right on the ground
[2:05:54] where prophet Abraham
[2:05:57] set for that seed.
[2:05:59] when there will be no more sea.
[2:06:04] Why there's no more sea? There's no more
[2:06:07] sea because in the sea is where the
[2:06:11] devil hide.
[2:06:14] Even if you can go deeper
[2:06:17] in this demon things,
[2:06:20] the sangas,
[2:06:22] there are those that goes to the
[2:06:24] mountain.
[2:06:26] There are those that goes to the river.
[2:06:29] But the most powerful ones
[2:06:32] are those that goes to the sea.
[2:06:37] When they come back there, they come
[2:06:39] back stronger. They are just demons. So
[2:06:43] that is why God will finish everything
[2:06:47] where the devil hides in that new city.
[2:06:51] There's no sea.
[2:06:53] There's no hiding place of the devil.
[2:06:58] The Bible said there'll be no more sea
[2:07:02] which about 34 of the earth is in water.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; And there will be no more sea.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; So it won't be too too big a city
[2:07:14] sitting in a place like that.
[2:07:19] I believe it will set in that little
[2:07:20] place where they fo about.
[2:07:26] And where God was born
[2:07:29] there in Bethlehem, I believe it will be
[2:07:32] right along in that Palestine day
[2:07:36] where it will raise up out of the earth
[2:07:40] right there be that mountain.
[2:07:45] You know the entire world has ever asked
[2:07:48] themselves.
[2:07:50] We've got America, we've got Russia,
[2:07:53] we've got China, we've got Africa, we've
[2:07:57] got Europe, we've got Canada, we've got
[2:08:00] many continents
[2:08:03] and many countries. Amen. Amen. But the
[2:08:06] entire world is looking at the Palestine
[2:08:12] there in Palestine.
[2:08:14] Brennan says is where the city will
[2:08:19] erupt
[2:08:22] in that little you know country there
[2:08:28] in that place
[2:08:31] Bible says Abraham
[2:08:34] was walking
[2:08:36] looking for a seed.
[2:08:38] He was being guided by God. But one of
[2:08:41] the days when he was walking somewhere
[2:08:46] when he stepped God came and meet him
[2:08:51] from the place where God met Abraham
[2:08:55] that's where the city
[2:09:02] for Israel is the chosen nation.
[2:09:09] The bride is the chosen woman.
[2:09:14] You are the chosen one.
[2:09:19] Brother says, "You are sinless.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; You are spotless.
[2:09:27] You are without wrinkle.
[2:09:34] you are that
[2:09:36] believe it.
[2:09:39] But looking at your mistake,
[2:09:42] you can see that you won't make it to
[2:09:44] heaven.
[2:09:47] You you just lied before you come to
[2:09:49] church.
[2:09:56] You know, God is a good God.
[2:09:58] One of the days Peter left the message
[2:10:05] doesn't work.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Even the person we trust, he's gone.
[2:10:09] He's gone.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; We are dead. We are finished.
[2:10:13] There's no way we can go. But God said,
[2:10:16] Peter, I gave you the keys. The keys of
[2:10:19] heaven. He never took them back. They
[2:10:22] still with Peter. He said the day you
[2:10:25] are transformed,
[2:10:28] strengthen your brethren.
[2:10:33] When God started something,
[2:10:36] you will finish it. But if you are with
[2:10:39] a people, you made a mistake or you
[2:10:42] started something, they started to
[2:10:44] count. You remember 1989,
[2:10:48] you remember 2012. You remember 2022.
[2:10:53] Now it's 2025. It's you again.
[2:10:59] That's a human being. But God said,
[2:11:03] "When I forgive you, I forget it."
[2:11:08] For I put
[2:11:11] in the
[2:11:13] forgetfulness.
[2:11:17] And I want to be honest with this woman.
[2:11:20] We go to heaven because of our deeds
[2:11:24] honestly.
[2:11:26] None of us will go to heaven.
[2:11:31] Don't tell me you can. You will be lying
[2:11:34] to me. This is the grace and the mercy
[2:11:38] of God
[2:11:40] in the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Why is it God so thought and care so
[2:11:53] much about that little place called
[2:11:55] Palestine
[2:12:00] when it's just a little spot
[2:12:03] but right there where the temple is set
[2:12:08] the physical temple of Jerusalem
[2:12:14] that's where the new Jerusalem will
[2:12:16] break up
[2:12:19] right there.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Olive mountain or Mount of Olive
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; shall leave
[2:12:27] shall part right and left
[2:12:32] when she pushes up from belief.
[2:12:37] Not they say is pushing apart but it's
[2:12:41] pushing up
[2:12:46] when he stand his holy feet upon the
[2:12:49] mountain.
[2:12:52] Notice on the throne
[2:12:54] 1500 miles high
[2:12:57] 1500 miles high length by breath
[2:13:02] is equal.
[2:13:04] That big seat
[2:13:06] God has made for the bride.
[2:13:10] Brothers and sisters, if you are the
[2:13:12] bride this morning, you don't have a
[2:13:15] right to be angry.
[2:13:18] You have the right to smile. You say
[2:13:21] whatever the people say. There's a city
[2:13:24] beyond the sky that I'm going to.
[2:13:29] That's where we are going.
[2:13:34] Don't be discouraged.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Now that city has got owners.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; The owner of that city,
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; it's yourself.
[2:13:46] God has built it for you.
[2:13:50] Hallelujah.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; I read
[2:13:53] and God Christ is our bridegroom.
[2:13:58] We are the bride.
[2:14:00] This is the other part of the covenant
[2:14:04] God made for his people with Christ.
[2:14:07] [Music]
[2:14:09] Christ
[2:14:10] up as a memorial
[2:14:12] set for the Holy Spirit
[2:14:15] as his covenant with his people.
[2:14:20] Amen. Amen.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; So that city is for us. Just imagine
[2:14:26] the people in the Old Testament. They
[2:14:29] lived the word of God.
[2:14:32] They lived the word of God.
[2:14:36] And but in the new city,
[2:14:39] they will be your servant.
[2:14:42] You will be the one that is in the city.
[2:14:49] Amen. Amen. They will ask permission
[2:14:52] from you
[2:14:54] for you for them to reach you. They pass
[2:14:59] either
[2:15:01] the eastern gate or the western gate or
[2:15:04] the northern gate or the southern gate
[2:15:07] to get inside.
[2:15:09] You will be there. You don't need a
[2:15:12] permission to go out inside, go all over
[2:15:17] because this thing was made for you.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Like a man and a wife, the wife, the
[2:15:32] wife has everything owns everything.
[2:15:36] [Music]
[2:15:39] Amen. Amen.
[2:15:41] You know men work and just bring money
[2:15:45] in their house but the women are very
[2:15:48] much good in using money.
[2:15:52] They just do everything in the house. Go
[2:15:55] and look at the can be a big house or a
[2:15:59] nice house of a man who's alone.
[2:16:03] You could there
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; you could see
[2:16:09] there's a wife missing in here.
[2:16:25] Hey brother, there's a sister missing
[2:16:27] here.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; You being able,
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; but you still miss need a sister
[2:16:41] because
[2:16:43] that union,
[2:16:46] it makes things work better.
[2:16:50] That is why God was just alone. But at
[2:16:55] the end, he has the bride in that city.
[2:17:03] The woman that should be in that seat,
[2:17:07] it's yourself.
[2:17:09] [Applause]
[2:17:10] [Music]
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we we we we see these things
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; and you know on a daily basis
[2:17:21] it's likened unto what God is teaching
[2:17:24] us.
[2:17:26] He liken it in many parables
[2:17:29] like in a husband and wife. He calls the
[2:17:32] church the bride
[2:17:35] and the bride is no longer
[2:17:38] and the bridegroom is no longer two
[2:17:41] people.
[2:17:43] They are one.
[2:17:47] She's the flesh of his flesh, the bone
[2:17:50] of his bone.
[2:17:53] And then when a man and a woman is
[2:17:54] called a mystical body of Christ Jesus
[2:17:56] by the Holy Spirit,
[2:18:00] they become a full member
[2:18:04] of his body when they filled with the
[2:18:07] Holy Ghost
[2:18:09] because God took the spirit out of
[2:18:11] Christ.
[2:18:14] raise up his body,
[2:18:16] place it on the throne, and send back
[2:18:20] the Holy Spirit to make the mystical
[2:18:22] body of Christ,
[2:18:27] which will be united at the merit
[2:18:32] at the coming of the Lord. You cannot
[2:18:35] organize it.
[2:18:37] It is a mystery,
[2:18:40] men and God.
[2:18:42] has come together.
[2:18:45] Bride and the bridegroom.
[2:18:47] Heaven and earth have embraced each
[2:18:50] other.
[2:18:52] God has come down to dwell amongst men.
[2:18:57] Tabernacle is with them.
[2:19:03] Amen.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; God and us are one.
[2:19:10] groom and the bride are one.
[2:19:17] Amen.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; There are certain men
[2:19:22] that hide behind them.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't want to give you
[2:19:26] something, you say, "Hey, no, my wife
[2:19:28] doesn't."
[2:19:34] Because
[2:19:36] a bride
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; is the reflection.
[2:19:40] of the groom.
[2:19:46] If he can say the wife doesn't agree,
[2:19:48] you won't repeat. You just stop.
[2:19:52] In actual fact, he's the one who doesn't
[2:19:54] woman.
[2:19:57] She was just reflected. If you try to
[2:19:59] hide yourself,
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; you are woman.
[2:20:03] The one who show who you are.
[2:20:07] If Christ
[2:20:09] Jesus is behind since well he injected
[2:20:13] us
[2:20:15] with his spirit
[2:20:17] expose him.
[2:20:19] Now when the people look at her they say
[2:20:23] you being a man you make yourself God
[2:20:27] because they see the characteristic.
[2:20:32] Amen. Amen. Then the bride will come to
[2:20:36] be with the groom
[2:20:38] and the groom with the bride.
[2:20:41] And then great millennium
[2:20:43] after the whole world is destroyed by
[2:20:45] eternal
[2:20:48] and there will be new heavens
[2:20:51] and the new earth and they shall live
[2:20:54] together.
[2:20:57] Amen. Amen. So if the groom is with us,
[2:21:02] we becomes untouchable.
[2:21:07] No one can harm us because the groom is
[2:21:12] here.
[2:21:14] No one can touch us because the angels
[2:21:19] has protected us.
[2:21:21] You are right in the middle.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When you look on the side,
[2:21:28] it's the disciples
[2:21:30] is their ministries.
[2:21:33] But that ministry is protecting you,
[2:21:37] children of God. The ministry of the
[2:21:41] disciples of the apostles has protected
[2:21:44] you.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. the the slide of the pyramid.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; H slide a pyramiding.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; H if they can show us the slide of the
[2:21:59] pyramid. Why must the bridegroom be the
[2:22:03] word manifested made plain?
[2:22:09] Is because the bride and the bridegroom
[2:22:12] are one.
[2:22:15] She is just meeting piece of him.
[2:22:19] There is the masterpiece
[2:22:22] masterpiece.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; It was smitten
[2:22:24] referring to this one. Amen.
[2:22:27] When you look at this pyramid,
[2:22:30] the bride and the groom,
[2:22:32] they inside. But those blue dot around
[2:22:37] there are people
[2:22:39] that God has allowed them
[2:22:43] to be there with the mercy of God to
[2:22:48] enjoy the life eternal.
[2:22:51] The point of attraction
[2:22:54] is the one that is inside and inside
[2:22:58] there the lamp is the light.
[2:23:03] There's no sun,
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; there's no moon,
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; there's no sea.
[2:23:09] We are the one that are inside
[2:23:14] shineth by the light
[2:23:17] of the lamb
[2:23:20] because my title is about simultaneous
[2:23:22] appearance.
[2:23:26] After the white throne judgment,
[2:23:29] when we are being ushered to the new
[2:23:31] season,
[2:23:33] the people that disbelieve the word of
[2:23:36] God
[2:23:37] into hell.
[2:23:40] Burning hell now.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; So now there's no bailing hell.
[2:23:46] But after the white throne judgment
[2:23:48] there is burning hell
[2:23:51] and hell and hell is not eternal.
[2:23:56] Brother Benham speak about the eternal
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; and the everlasting.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; Somewhere somehow
[2:24:08] those that are burning in hell, they
[2:24:11] will come to an end
[2:24:14] are no more. Those that believe the word
[2:24:18] of God will pass judgment
[2:24:23] life eternal
[2:24:25] and we have life eternal.
[2:24:28] Amen.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; If you have life eternal,
[2:24:32] keep on moving.
[2:24:36] The bride
[2:24:38] goes wherever
[2:24:40] the groom is.
[2:24:43] She will never be left by him.
[2:24:47] She will never leave his side.
[2:24:52] She will share the throne with him.
[2:24:56] She will be the crown with the glory.
[2:25:02] You know in those old days
[2:25:06] as a bride or the wife of the king
[2:25:10] you were not just allowed to see the
[2:25:12] king.
[2:25:14] You needed the appointment.
[2:25:18] If you go without the permission, you
[2:25:21] might be killed. But Esther
[2:25:26] prayed God that I should meet the king
[2:25:30] with or without the permission
[2:25:32] of anybody. Then she went there and the
[2:25:36] king have mercy on her
[2:25:40] because the wife of the king.
[2:25:44] The king is obliged
[2:25:48] to protect
[2:25:50] the queen.
[2:25:52] We are obliged
[2:25:54] to protect
[2:25:56] our bride.
[2:26:00] I don't want to go further that one.
[2:26:08] They can excommunicate you,
[2:26:11] but let's protect the queens.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; The marriage of the land
[2:26:23] it's like our natural weddings.
[2:26:29] You know, when you go to a wedding, we
[2:26:31] go there,
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; it's nice, everybody's here and then the
[2:26:37] groom will come then
[2:26:42] and then there goes the No, there's no
[2:26:45] when the groom come. There's
[2:26:52] but when the bride comes
[2:26:59] the important one is the bride.
[2:27:03] When the bride enter
[2:27:06] the veil on that's when we clap and we
[2:27:12] brothers and sisters when we enter in
[2:27:16] that seat the people that are there are
[2:27:20] ready
[2:27:22] late welcome us as we'll be entering in
[2:27:27] the new city that our groom

[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; You are the most important person in the
[2:27:40] e economy of God.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; It's just that you haven't seen it.
[2:27:46] Brother Brandham said it. I saw you
[2:27:48] there.
[2:27:50] [Music]
[2:27:52] If you can get that confirmation,
[2:27:56] you won't have a problem anymore. Amen.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; The bride goes wherever the the groom
[2:28:02] is.
[2:28:04] Now he the groom, the bridegroom
[2:28:08] took away
[2:28:11] your shame.
[2:28:13] When a brother is getting is marrying
[2:28:16] the sister, he took away the shame.
[2:28:24] Amen. Amen.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Do you know
[2:28:28] You know sometime the sisters are
[2:28:30] sisters.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; The sisters are sisters
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; when when that sometimes in the church
[2:28:37] they are clapping hands or they are
[2:28:39] raising hands they use this one to show
[2:28:45] they don't use the right one but they
[2:28:47] have that pride of like
[2:28:53] hallelujah.
[2:28:56] Can't you see?
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. Just look at it. You
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; But it's us. We We are very much proud
[2:29:07] about the husband who married us. We'll
[2:29:10] keep on saying hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:29:13] Let the world know that we got married
[2:29:17] to a man. Yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:29:21] That is why he took our shame and we are
[2:29:25] not shame of him wherever we go. We talk
[2:29:30] about him.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; And he put he put it our shame.
[2:29:41] in the sea of forgetfulness
[2:29:45] by the washing of the water
[2:29:48] of the word and the blood of life.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; There's a verse in the Bible
[2:29:56] saying the devil was always reporting us
[2:30:02] to God. But the book of revelation say
[2:30:05] the one that report us to God does not
[2:30:10] have a chance.
[2:30:12] Why he look at our red sea
[2:30:18] the the red sin
[2:30:22] with the red blood of our Lord Jesus
[2:30:26] Christ is see white.
[2:30:34] Now we start to be proud.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible say. Your first
[2:30:41] husband that you were married to
[2:30:45] the world, the anointed bridegroom
[2:30:50] with four ordained you
[2:30:54] has washed you by the washing of the
[2:30:56] water by the church or which that don't
[2:31:01] sound right.
[2:31:03] You might find that in the almanic
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; but not in the go's bible.
[2:31:11] by the washing of the water,
[2:31:14] by the weight in the weight.
[2:31:17] That's what he did to us. Can I tell you
[2:31:20] something? Not because you've done
[2:31:23] something good before.
[2:31:27] He just loved you unconditionally.
[2:31:33] Now you are pure
[2:31:37] vicuous
[2:31:39] sinless bride of the son of the living
[2:31:40] God.
[2:31:43] Every man and woman that's born of the
[2:31:46] spirit of God
[2:31:48] and wash in the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:31:51] and believes every word of God stand as
[2:31:55] though
[2:31:56] you never sin the earth.
[2:32:01] You are perfect.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ
[2:32:07] has cleans you. Let me ask you. If you
[2:32:11] are pure,
[2:32:13] you are vicious, you are sinless.
[2:32:19] What more do you want?
[2:32:23] The word of God stand for you
[2:32:26] as you have never seen.
[2:32:30] at the first place.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; Our God is a good God.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; It's like having your own self maybe is
[2:32:45] living this kind of life out there
[2:32:50] then you will they will come and report
[2:32:54] Amen. Amen. That your son is doing this
[2:32:57] and this
[2:32:59] Then you will say, "Yeah,
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; yeah."
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; Then you then they report.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; Then they keep on reporting. You'll end
[2:33:09] up saying, "Yeah, it's my son.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Leave him as he is."
[2:33:15] That's what God did to us. The devil was
[2:33:18] reporting us. And he's very much good.
[2:33:22] He put you in trouble.
[2:33:25] You put you in trouble. and deport you.
[2:33:29] God has sinned.
[2:33:31] God has sinned and said to the devil,
[2:33:33] "Yeah, it's my son. It's my daughter.
[2:33:37] I'll sort him out." What he did, he died
[2:33:40] for you in the cross. When he look at
[2:33:43] you, he look at you as a vicious
[2:33:46] someone, a sinless someone, someone that
[2:33:49] is pure
[2:33:51] because the flesh cannot be perfect.
[2:33:59] There's a being
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; inside you. That one
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; is perfect.
[2:34:07] That one is the one that comes from God.
[2:34:12] That one is the one that worship God.
[2:34:16] That one is the one that will inherit in
[2:34:20] the city of God.
[2:34:23] Not this one.
[2:34:25] This one was born in 19 so
[2:34:29] but that one our pastor normally teach
[2:34:32] us it was not born it was processed
[2:34:38] from God
[2:34:41] is this way
[2:34:43] God was alone then he take out his
[2:34:47] attributes
[2:34:49] being us and put us there and build a
[2:34:53] city for us.
[2:34:57] We are no longer preaching
[2:34:59] like God in us
[2:35:03] or us in God.
[2:35:06] But in the city, it's him and us. We are
[2:35:12] one, but he's there. We are there. We
[2:35:16] talk to him. He's talking to us.
[2:35:24] Let me give you an example. Like a young
[2:35:26] man, you are young, you get married and
[2:35:30] one of the say
[2:35:33] we we say let the young man stand up
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; while you have your wife
[2:35:45] psychiatric hospital.
[2:35:49] Exactly what God did.
[2:35:52] He was one being one.
[2:35:56] He took us out of him.
[2:35:59] Now God is no longer one. He is the
[2:36:02] groom. We are the bride.
[2:36:06] And that will happen
[2:36:08] eternally.
[2:36:09] [Music]
[2:36:12] Future home. Future home.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; Every day we are traveling. We are in a
[2:36:18] journey. You take you you need to ask
[2:36:21] yourself
[2:36:22] where will you spend your eternity.
[2:36:27] I'm not saying this for the sake of
[2:36:29] saying it but those that are of God they
[2:36:34] will know that they will spend their
[2:36:36] eternity
[2:36:38] with God.
[2:36:41] Can I tell you this? A complete job
[2:36:45] was done.
[2:36:49] When God starts something, there's no
[2:36:52] amendment along the way.
[2:36:56] He will complete it perfect.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; Future home. Future home. It speaks of
[2:37:03] eternity.
[2:37:05] Where will you spend your time
[2:37:08] in heaven? You travel like a dog.
[2:37:12] You know, in the new city, the bride is
[2:37:15] inside. If you feel like
[2:37:21] he's outside the city, you are there.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you feel like you want to talk
[2:37:30] to Daniel, you think about him. He is
[2:37:33] there. That's what will happen in the
[2:37:36] new city.
[2:37:38] will be traveling like a th
[2:37:45] struggling on a weekly basis
[2:37:50] but the future home
[2:37:54] give us comfort.
[2:37:57] You know we are all human beings
[2:38:00] apps
[2:38:06] not because you have money
[2:38:09] or you are learned
[2:38:11] but because you are a human being
[2:38:16] emotions
[2:38:19] anger anxiety
[2:38:22] frustration
[2:38:24] harm still when you have what the world
[2:38:28] needs.
[2:38:30] But when you are going on those up and
[2:38:32] down
[2:38:35] only comfort that will come to you is
[2:38:39] the new seat. You just tell yourself
[2:38:43] well things are not okay in my life but
[2:38:47] there's a future home
[2:38:50] one of the days I will reach my hope
[2:38:54] beyond the sky. That's what can comfort
[2:38:57] you.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; We can only say Lord give us our daily
[2:39:04] bread
[2:39:06] where you did not speak about budget.
[2:39:10] Reading about a man who had a money
[2:39:14] until he didn't know what to do with his
[2:39:16] own money.
[2:39:18] Every one of us here needs money
[2:39:24] until the the other day
[2:39:26] his daughter was called
[2:39:30] then he took money
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; to warm
[2:39:37] to warm the daughter.
[2:39:43] Amen. because he realized life is better
[2:39:47] than money.
[2:39:50] But to others money is better than life.
[2:39:55] That is why they can kill for money.
[2:40:03] What belongs to God belongs to God.
[2:40:09] This one is
[2:40:14] eternity
[2:40:15] is where I come from.
[2:40:18] Our father God is drawing us back
[2:40:24] to eternity. For the new city
[2:40:28] was there before. He show it to Moses.
[2:40:32] He showed to Abraham. He showed to
[2:40:35] brother Ben. Showing it to us.
[2:40:38] That's where we are going. I cannot sin
[2:40:42] because where I come from eternity,
[2:40:45] there's no sin.
[2:40:48] If you recognize that you are in
[2:40:51] eternity, then you are in eternity. But
[2:40:55] most of the people, they don't think
[2:40:57] about them. They still relying what the
[2:41:01] world can give to them.
[2:41:06] We are preaching to the bride today, we
[2:41:09] are the bride because if our husband is
[2:41:13] alpha and omega, we are alpha and we are
[2:41:18] him.
[2:41:20] You cannot separate us. Amen.
[2:41:25] We we are no longer you know living in
[2:41:28] this world because the the inner man the
[2:41:32] real man the him
[2:41:36] is looking up to the new city
[2:41:40] brothers and sisters. Just be like that
[2:41:43] frog.
[2:41:45] Close your eyes and go up brothers and
[2:41:48] sisters. Just be like an eagle.
[2:41:52] Fly to the highest.
[2:41:57] Amen.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; As the other people are saying, if
[2:42:01] somebody is trying to pull you when you
[2:42:04] are flying high, it tells you that is
[2:42:08] lower than you
[2:42:10] are high. Go high and higher.
[2:42:17] As the prophet says, we have passed the
[2:42:21] curtain of time.
[2:42:23] We are no longer in the church ages.
[2:42:27] We are in the bride age.
[2:42:31] If we are in the bride age, the devil
[2:42:35] will do us no harm.
[2:42:38] Christ and the bride will speak the same
[2:42:41] language.
[2:42:44] One mind,
[2:42:46] one spirit
[2:42:47] [Music]
[2:42:49] is us and him.
[2:42:52] Amen.
[2:42:55] &gt;&gt; The the seven seal
[2:42:57] open up what it was.
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; The seven seal
[2:43:04] open up
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; what it was. It was a past.
[2:43:10] We were somewhere. When the seals are
[2:43:13] open today, it's just telling us who we
[2:43:17] were.
[2:43:20] What is all open there?
[2:43:24] The bride. What is all open?
[2:43:28] The bride should preach of what it was
[2:43:34] and bring into what it is
[2:43:37] today.
[2:43:39] Let's worship the present tense God.
[2:43:47] The bride if the Christ was made of what
[2:43:49] was
[2:43:54] the bride if Christ was made of what was
[2:43:59] and what she is now is what is happening
[2:44:02] today. The time we are living in the
[2:44:06] time we are living in is beyond time.
[2:44:11] We are
[2:44:13] the time of the church ages. Will pass
[2:44:17] the time of millennium. We'll pass the
[2:44:20] time of white judgment. When we get to
[2:44:24] eternity, there's no more time.
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; There was a time when the word
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; did not find the place in the people.
[2:44:39] That's what the pastor said the other
[2:44:40] day.
[2:44:44] Even if you preach
[2:44:46] harder and harder is not changing them
[2:44:54] because it won't help them.
[2:44:58] The reason why we come to the service
[2:45:02] is not because we are going to change
[2:45:05] our life.
[2:45:08] No,
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; it's just that we are going to be more
[2:45:12] visible than yesterday.
[2:45:19] &gt;&gt; The word of God cannot change Satan to
[2:45:22] be saints.
[2:45:26] I'm trying to tell you that if we were
[2:45:30] the bride to begin with, we will remain
[2:45:34] the bride. We will be the bride. We will
[2:45:38] be with him eternally.
[2:45:45] We are the place.
[2:45:48] Even Satan prepare his people.
[2:45:52] God preparing his people.
[2:45:55] God has prepared us. The devil is
[2:45:58] preparing his people.
[2:46:00] I said it the other day. Allow me to say
[2:46:03] it today.
[2:46:04] This is a play
[2:46:08] whereby
[2:46:09] is between God and man between the devil
[2:46:14] and men. When you are in the middle,
[2:46:17] it's either you serve God or you serve
[2:46:21] the devil. There's no neutral place. So
[2:46:25] when we are in a journey, you will find
[2:46:28] the people that are serving God. You
[2:46:31] will find the people that are saving the
[2:46:33] devil. But we are in the journey
[2:46:36] together.
[2:46:38] You look at the people that goes for
[2:46:40] marathon. They start together in
[2:46:43] numbers.
[2:46:44] When they go in numbers but position one
[2:46:48] and two and three
[2:46:50] the rest along the journey. That is why
[2:46:55] if such marathon comes
[2:47:06] why
[2:47:08] they know along the way others will fall
[2:47:13] along the way others will need water
[2:47:16] along the way others will need stretcher
[2:47:19] along the way others will need
[2:47:21] medication
[2:47:23] But there must be a winner.
[2:47:27] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:47:29] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ is the winner.
[2:47:32] Is the chosen. Brother Brandham says we
[2:47:36] are a chosen church.
[2:47:39] There are churches. But we are a chosen
[2:47:42] church.
[2:47:43] And brother again says the bride of
[2:47:47] Jesus Christ. It's universal.
[2:47:51] Amen.
[2:47:55] We can be mad
[2:47:58] big in numbers not guarantee
[2:48:02] that we are all going to be raptured
[2:48:08] as a natural wedding
[2:48:15] destroy this bride and they are just
[2:48:19] accomp
[2:48:20] bride
[2:48:26] bridesmaid
[2:48:28] there somewhere.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; We need the bride
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; on the other side. We need the bride and
[2:48:33] the groom
[2:48:35] exactly is happening.
[2:48:38] Be careful.
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; Don't be a bridesmaid
[2:48:43] and then you come in.
[2:48:47] They say you and That's why there's four
[2:48:50] gates,
[2:48:51] east, west, north, and south.
[2:48:54] When are they
[2:48:56] to grant permission
[2:48:58] to the city? And that city was made for
[2:49:02] the bride. Who is the bride? The bride
[2:49:06] is from the first church age
[2:49:11] until the last church age. I mean I mean
[2:49:17] that is the bride as the Bible says let
[2:49:21] who has an ear
[2:49:26] take what the spirit says
[2:49:29] that is the bride only those people are
[2:49:31] the bride the rest are not the bride but
[2:49:36] God because he's God of mercy he's so
[2:49:39] gracious
[2:49:41] he will allow them to partake paid in
[2:49:45] the holy city
[2:49:47] but not as the bride.
[2:49:50] The bride is the one that will be in
[2:49:54] charge of everything
[2:49:56] but the rest might need the permission
[2:49:58] from.
[2:50:01] Amen.
[2:50:03] Now in our homes
[2:50:07] if somebody's asking something from the
[2:50:08] father
[2:50:10] check with the mother
[2:50:14] And then he then looks aside
[2:50:17] when the mother says no I'm not giving
[2:50:19] him
[2:50:21] I don't have power you hurt yourself
[2:50:25] even if they
[2:50:27] even even if they don't agree
[2:50:32] the women
[2:50:34] &gt;&gt; they have power
[2:50:36] to control
[2:50:37] &gt;&gt; the wealth
[2:50:39] if you see a family it's a giving image
[2:50:43] is because the heart of a woman and the
[2:50:46] heart of a man are together in the
[2:50:50] family is natural. You see it when you
[2:50:54] get to marry your right partner at the
[2:50:58] end
[2:50:59] at the end
[2:51:02] people think that you are a brother and
[2:51:04] a sister. Brother Brenham says until
[2:51:07] even your heart beat like the same
[2:51:12] I'm trying to tell you that if Christ
[2:51:14] Jesus is in us, there's no difference
[2:51:19] between the bride,
[2:51:22] they are one and whatever they doing,
[2:51:25] they do it together.
[2:51:28] [Music]
[2:51:29] So the natural
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; type the spiritual what cry or in our
[2:51:35] natural life what is happening to us is
[2:51:39] happening to the lord Jesus Christ with
[2:51:43] his bride.
[2:51:45] Amen. Amen. That's where we are heading
[2:51:47] to. Amen. Amen. That's what I wanted to
[2:51:51] share with the children of
[2:51:53] I will be going somewhere
[2:51:56] till we meet again.
[2:51:58] Amen.
[2:52:07] Keep on moving forward.
[2:52:12] Things are in control.
[2:52:15] Don't even worry.
[2:52:20] Let's stand to our feet and sing unto
[2:52:23] the Lord.
[2:52:43] [Music]
[2:52:53] Yes.

[3:01:26] we can dip in the ink and to write about

[3:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:02] &gt;&gt; Our pastor Israela
[3:10:06] &gt;&gt; stood behind this pullpit.
[3:10:10] and preached and revealed the seventh
[3:10:13] seal.
[3:10:15] &gt;&gt; We are so glad Lord God Almighty
[3:10:20] that when the elders come to the pull
[3:10:22] pit,
[3:10:24] &gt;&gt; they can refer back
[3:10:28] to the message that the pastor preached.
[3:10:32] [Music]
[3:10:33] &gt;&gt; Bless our brother.
[3:10:38] Amen.
[3:10:40] &gt;&gt; Bless our pastor
[3:10:43] &gt;&gt; for revealing the weight throughout
[3:10:47] our days.
[3:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:52] &gt;&gt; He kept us alive.
[3:10:56] &gt;&gt; We are who we are.
[3:11:00] &gt;&gt; Because of his message.
[3:11:03] [Music]
[3:11:03] [Applause]
[3:11:06] He stood behind the pullpit
[3:11:10] and said, "Don't you know that you are
[3:11:12] the Amacha God?"
[3:11:17] &gt;&gt; And we know, Lord God Almighty,
[3:11:22] that when Adam was a minor God,
[3:11:25] he had supreme control of everything.
[3:11:30] &gt;&gt; He could tell the mountains to move.
[3:11:33] and the mountains will move.
[3:11:38] &gt;&gt; He could stop the storms.
[3:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:42] &gt;&gt; And we are so glad
[3:11:44] this morning, Lord God Almighty,
[3:11:48] &gt;&gt; that we could stop those storms.
[3:11:52] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray
[3:11:57] here at the believers that have had thy
[3:12:00] word.
[3:12:02] Some traveled as far as Debon
[3:12:06] to come
[3:12:08] and to fulfill the word and to be
[3:12:10] baptized.
[3:12:12] Our desire Lord God Almighty
[3:12:16] is that they can grow
[3:12:18] up through the faith
[3:12:22] until they also receive the rapturing
[3:12:24] faith
[3:12:26] &gt;&gt; until they can also say we are the
[3:12:30] amateur gods. Amen.
[3:12:32] &gt;&gt; Bless them abundantly, Lord. Bless our
[3:12:35] pastor. Bless the church as we commit
[3:12:38] them unto thee. In the mighty name of
[3:12:41] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we
[3:12:43] pray. Amen.
[3:12:45] [Applause]
[3:12:52] &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 2 from verse 36-39.
[3:12:57] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[3:12:59] know assuredly that God hath made that
[3:13:02] same Jesus, whom he have crucified, both
[3:13:05] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[3:13:08] this, they were plked in their heart,
[3:13:10] and said unto Peter, and to the rest of
[3:13:12] the apostles, men and brethren, what
[3:13:15] shall we do? Then Peter said unto them,
[3:13:18] "Repent and be baptized, every one of
[3:13:21] you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[3:13:23] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[3:13:25] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[3:13:28] the promise is unto you and your
[3:13:30] children, and to all that are a far off,
[3:13:33] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[3:13:35] call.

[3:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray.
[3:19:31] Gracious and eternal father, once more,
[3:19:35] Lord God, we want to appreciate for
[3:19:37] everything that you have done unto us.
[3:19:40] Here Lord God are the soldiers training
[3:19:43] the army. We know Lord God, you knew
[3:19:46] them before the foundation of the world.
[3:19:49] You knew that today they will be
[3:19:52] identifying themselves with this
[3:19:54] ministry. I remember once upon a time
[3:19:58] our great great great grandmother, the
[3:20:00] queen of Sheba who left Africa for
[3:20:03] Jerusalem to see the wisdom of Solomon
[3:20:07] Mogara
[3:20:08] once upon a time as children from
[3:20:11] Ethiopia went to Jerusalem to worship
[3:20:14] and he said who can stop me from getting
[3:20:17] baptized
[3:20:18] today heavenly father
[3:20:21] we are just heavenly father
[3:20:25] uh saying here is the family of the
[3:20:27] Kumalo whom you have chosen to get
[3:20:30] baptized.
[3:20:32] Bless them Lord God. You know better
[3:20:36] about them. Our sister once more Nandipa
[3:20:39] all the way from Deon just for baptism.
[3:20:42] It shows how she loves God. Heavenly
[3:20:46] father this should not be in vain. bless
[3:20:50] her heavenly father and everyone that
[3:20:53] will be traveling from different places.
[3:20:57] We know Lord God you never failed us.
[3:21:00] Bless our precious elder Kabazela Mokoi
[3:21:03] for him to go all the way and preach
[3:21:06] this gospel. We see the fruits of this
[3:21:09] gospel. They've just announced Lord God
[3:21:13] nine souls were baptized yesterday in
[3:21:15] the same quazul.
[3:21:18] This is not the work of a man but is
[3:21:20] beyond our thinking is beyond our
[3:21:23] effort. Heavenly father I know our
[3:21:26] precious elder was with them once more.
[3:21:29] Let them continue with the lord the work
[3:21:32] of lord. Let them work tirelessly
[3:21:36] because you have put that wisdom within
[3:21:39] their heart. Heavenly father you know
[3:21:42] better. You know us each and everything
[3:21:45] that is happening in our heart. You know
[3:21:47] Lord God that is why there's no other
[3:21:51] place we can go but we know this place
[3:21:54] is a better souls a place where our soul
[3:21:57] shall be fed heavenly father as we'll be
[3:22:00] leaving to our places grant us Lord God
[3:22:05] our traveling mercies to our home state
[3:22:08] so that if there is a tomorrow or there
[3:22:10] is another Sunday we may come again and
[3:22:13] dine upon this table. Bless each and
[3:22:16] everyone of us. Bless our pastor. Give
[3:22:19] him strength. We will pray. As he said,
[3:22:21] he'll be coming here when pastor
[3:22:23] Magguire is around. We will pray for
[3:22:25] that day. We love you so much, Lord God.
[3:22:28] We put everything unto your capable hand
[3:22:32] in the mighty name of our Lord and
[3:22:33] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:22:36] [Applause]
[3:22:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
