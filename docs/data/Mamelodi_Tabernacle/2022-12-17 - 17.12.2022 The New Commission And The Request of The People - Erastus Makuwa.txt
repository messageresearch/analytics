Title: The New Commission And The Request of The People
Description: This message was preached  by Pastor Israel Nkodima in  Leeuwfontein at Spoken Word Tabernacle, invited by Pastor Erastus Makuwa on Saturday afternoon 17th December 2022. 

The primary purpose of this sermon is to make both our viewers and community aware that Our Lord Jesus Christ spoke about three commissions to the Church, the first and second has gone through, the third which is the New commission that the Lord gave, is now in process, especially to those who live  post the Laodicean Church Age.  During the service the Pastor read Joshua 1 : 1- 5  ““Now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass, that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.”
‭‭
 The spirit of the Lord let the Pastor to lay foundation for the title teaching the Church about a Commission God gave unto Joshua to take Israelites to cross Jordan unto the promised land. The Pastor indicated that the request of the people that pledged allegiance to Joshua did not receive it from here, but from the father, giving example about Sister Hattie. The Pastor closed by reading from the spoken word “As I was with Moses”, reading a quotation But God will take his Holy Spirit and will raise his Joshuas that will take the Church to the promise . He read the scripture Hebrews 9:15...

to it okay amen our refrigerator more we are here by the grace of God and um we he's a great Eagle of this site [Music] okay I mean when calling we hear him all right you know when an eagle calls you now which actor Pete will hear that call an eagle um that's why he says my ship know my voice we are thankful our pasta oh man amen God has chosen you to be his part okay amen and this message is preached by the part of the message yeah you know as we were following another direction of the threefold Ministry so you can be seated we have realized that it started [Music] and as he said that day you shall know that I am in my father and you in me how many do you see there but he says that day you shall know meaning that he was talking to one part of the threefold over even yesterday I was looking at something and hey you know this message whatever but that's another part where he says even the angels of heaven don't know he's coming he said something that is very confusing to somebody unless you are part of the system then we ask which son which is amen amen then I realized that's part of it here in the book of The Seven Seals wanted me forever Iranian because the Sun Adam now it is Adam who should know how much you are supposed to know any other Sun substitute it will just pass on to the sun in position towards a substitute you are amen that threefold has saved us he is in the father we are in him okay amen so the message is coming from these three folders [Music] it's preached by the father by us now we are we are the bride of Christ we are not a message that is what they call the message the people talking about the message churches but we are talking about the bride of Christ so we'll take one part which I could say that it remained with our pastor yeah one part is a mediator okay and when is he a mediated because somewhere it puts him not to us not as a mediator but under the new Commission no the new commission commission is of the Angels alone all right I mean and you know that as the prophet says okay you were there before there was an angel [Applause] that's why the message it is okay amen we are talking of the what as he says Angels foreign [Music] I mean amen not when the seventh seal was opened actually was revealed it says the angels of heaven knew the where or or owned by it here now we have caught up with that by God's grace thing when in heaven they saw things now where where was The Silence nah why because they were out by age when now usually things were sent down oh man so in heaven not on Earth things were sent down and heaven and all that's in heaven let's today let's just read this part and the Lord willing and then we will continue and foreign [Music] actually what's in my heart is when they come one day we'll arrange the meetings on this side [Music] amen God bless you now you know last time we were looking at this subjects and when we were about to start off foreign [Music] I would love to visit you okay to talk about these things and then I realized that among all the among the people there are those that are predestinated to receive these things [Music] then when our pasta also yeah I realized that in his heart it was just the same thing I'll tell you as we open here let God tell us I mean and the River Jordan when it comes to rapturing Faith [Music] Elijah is started with an Elijah Alicia Elia will act for the River Jordan okay as you're done that was the last commission there and I believe that we are we are already appreciate Wonderland [Music] when the Flying Machine before it could foreign like Enoch not only Enoch the seventh from Adam and you know brother Brennan is the seventh from Paul yeah okay that's why uh the main responsible for the structure called pyramids pyramid and I it says here the scientists [Music] cannot interpret [Music] the inner pyramid and we say this we went through the message foreign too long no other one could interpret now you know God said to the the Lord Jesus is sometimes said to uh their Pharisees and so forth my word has Helena no place in you come foreign [Applause] [Music] because they they were made of the way I'm going back to that kind of scripture here if maybe in respect of him not me the pastor foreign I have a brother here to you know I am I think I in my ears yeah all right but fella in the message we are younger than our years and we are we are getting younger and younger than our years because we have the seven churches that is but we have the Seven Seals okay now I will open you yeah and Joshua again chapter 1 verse 1 to 5. scripture I I think are you responsible who's responsible for reading our brother okay chapter one verse one to five now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of noon Moses Minister said Moses my seventh is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all these people and to the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall Trot upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river you afraid to us all the land of the heaters and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any men be able to stand before they all the days of their life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake me okay do you also use our language I don't know how do we are we supposed to present it is right [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] we are thankful okay I mean shall we just say a word of Prayer after reading the way God bless you amen yes [Music] knowing Heavenly Father this is the scripture that will put us in our position we know very well that the minister of Joshua was not like unto the one of Moses so we believe this afternoon will be in our position When we arrive in the Tabernacle here heavenly father will be living knowing better Who We Are I remember the pastor previously he was teaching about what we are and who we are Heavenly Father say when I really wants us nothing but the second of Eternity may you put our pastor under your wing Heavenly Father may you lift him a little bit higher may you looked unto heaven and store that you put for us being coming down to us and settle in our heart we left everything that we know what we have and come to this place knowing Heavenly Father it is not in vain you will be talking to our innermost you will be talking to yourself heavenly father because we are just part of you Heavenly Father the true or be of God that the pastor is talking about is just as a new Lord we appreciate you so much bless our brother Billa as you'll be interpreting if he can fly at the level where the pastor is who will benefit from the heavenly father may you lift your church again in the same spirit and atmosphere but the angel behind the pulpit is so that the heavenly father when he speaks his amen after amen for you will be talking to us bless each and every individual Lord as we believe in you and put everything unto a capable end in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen I mean you may be seated God bless you okay I don't know if somebody can give me guidelines where there or timeline [Music] I should not go overboard in respect of you okay here we are and let us look at the scripture that will show us where we are you know the commission Ellen we had the first commission yeah [Music] when Jesus who came the first time calling out the disciples the position there Liam he was not a mediator I mean he was with them but after he resurrected he died and God bless you sir okay I'm here always helps me with this but in the long run yeah all right but I'm with my um [Music] you can look at it amen okay now we are going to realize that the bride today is not he is not a mediator to the bride today we are going to read it because he said that day you shall know that I am in you foreign and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance right amen after his death Resurrection then he became will follow this hearing [Music] now when that is a page 93 of the seals although I don't know which version is this don't find it in your book and then you look into into some other uh since versions okay I mean but now Charlie it says Siri now when we hit this in the seals we are going to go back there and see the souls under the altars [Music] Lord how long how long here is is as a mediator on the old time just a little longer until there is more to suffer like you that that was the answer to the souls under the altars when they cried how long how long just wait a little longer until some of your breaths but now he comes through from here at the last seal which which one is the last series he is no more a mediator because the seventh is the end all things move the second seal is the end of the seventh sealable yes now he says but now when he comes actually yeah and this last seal he is a king now now we realize that we are the Seed of Abraham when he was a king to Abraham foreign we have seven steps to the king's chamber foreign talking about the New Jerusalem all right amen amen say it future home okay now I read here now with the lamb I'm going back with the book in his hands we are ready to ask for his grace originally in the hand of um all right originally it was in the hands of him and was given to Adam and when Adam fulfated the book the original okay holder of the book took it back then applied the law of mulawa and Reconciliation now then he he kept the book well the names of the people to be redeemed were in that Marina okay now the book was a title of our Redemption we we say we are the redeemed because we we we have the title team I was titled it [Applause] okay amen and uh this book uh John was forbidden to write Johanna [Music] okay amen and because it is the Book of Secrets the title dates that's right at the end of time he was on the throne yeah because God is dealing with his sons he has to take his position he has to deal with them from their Thrones you know the Royal people are receiving the message from the throne [Applause] not just we simply [Applause] amen yes sir that's how God will always deal with his son you know that it says yes it was example indeed in there okay what what it was what or how was it he is referring to a certain time you know that's it in time now watch there came a man to Abraham Abraham this man was melchized but true now with Abraham and this milk he said as the prophet puts it he came through the house he entered the house thank you amen I will come and read it you know a city in the book souls in prison okay yes I think it's page 42. these things are wonderful I remember a brother there was a place with the hell was a bending foreign then I read out of this book my Prophet tells me hell now because it says Jesus when he resurrected he went to hell did he go to a Birmingham because Satan was there because hey he says it will start to bend and the judgment is that nice but right now but at the judgments [Music] that's the residency of Satan let us look at this now uh this brother of mindset I thought hell is a burning Place yeah I said but not now okay according to yeah okay no let me take this part here I'm trying to show something here okay just assume that we are going to follow the things foreign [Music] of the seven angels [Music] feeling okay now here I'm looking at someone here at something yeah um what is the third pool now okay because they come as constellations and you can only hear the word when you are in a constellation [Music] that's why uh brother put in a constellation and the message followed Amen in the constellations you know we we were in the constellation of a three-fold foreign himself said yeah that is John John 14 20. amen yeah John 14 verse he says that is this when the threefold Revelation is revealed you are part of God [Applause] when the father says something originally the very same thing will be said by the Sun it comes through a three four the very same message now you realize that when it is a three-fold Ministry it is coming from a constellation of a three-fold revelation foreign [Music] [Music] to tell the truth before God foreign I I don't undermine the other people again [Music] but fella I know where to preach these things [Applause] I must come to a Shepherd okay preaches and believes the same thing foreign [Music] there was one day we can learn by these things if I read something of you then I can look at back at it they wait and say then where is my position blue the prophecies you know if God says let there be light it's a word but when there is life a manifestation that's the difference you can please just save the whole night no way but you should follow that way because if if he says let there be life now you can keep on preaching God will never repeat that because I think I've got it here let there be light now you know the seventh angel messenger came and preached and some of the things that we we had him preaching cannot be repeated we are not repeating we are manifesting Fair now amen you know that's why when we set for the exam exams there would be some teachers walking around like this shaking [Music] what you are putting on that question paper whether it's from yourself foreign I mean I mean that's what the Bible says examine yourself [Music] we are not using copyrights we are the manifestation what God did and then he's continued the same thing the third pool actually it's not a preaching positive it is God talking through you [Applause] all right now let us look at it when the pastor comes here preaching him okay today that is the word of God amen before really and the pastor comes for the manifestation of that way that's why we country we can't come here I can't come here and say take off that Ministry I'm talking to the bride you understand then take off dance that is the thing of the past when we come to the bride it says yeah if he is in you how can somebody comes whether it's myself and saying stop telling lies because if he he is in you the way that the pastor praise it's just a manifestation [Music] so you should be the way not just you're here hey where is that so it's not just a here amen yeah you must sing us that song okay let's leave this Foundation uh the prophet speaks of this year one another thing yeah you know when they were on the table there he said to them he narrated to them about his experienced squirrels among all the people it is [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign about the truth now Charlie Charlie you hear reality when she said that about you the prophet said she didn't say it from here amen yeah we are coming into that it will show us you know hey don't try to say to a person or he is you are talking to a part of the three fruits but because that one knows that he knows when he is a mediator and when he is because this applies to to us you'll forgive me you know um you know let me but the Bible says I will find it here okay let me say it to you you know about sister hating um uh uh say that that sister Hetty look at the commission you know Sister the commission that's why we're coming to the the commission and the commission not the signpost you know now there are some the prophet comes now you look at him as a signpost but when you tend to the commission it's something different yes the people rally around the scientists of looking at the commission that's why we'll look at the commission what was he commissioned foreign foreign [Music] how old let God be with you Hallelujah man that that should be the request of the people when you come to the service you are not looking at the Second Hand Center the second end uh so it is the very same message they will run but like this message yes sir when the people thought that Moses has preached foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I will say this woman massage what God did foreign Now you listen to what when she said that brother Branham says oh brother he didn't say it from here I am but God spoke out of here [Music] that's why we say the spoken words uh listen Chile she says nothing assists foreign Peter Pedro said Thou Art the Christ son of the Living God and Charlie the same thing yes it is my father amen amen no the third pool that's when God amen amen that's what they said please amen [Music] this system when when your brother when brother narrated to them about this Jehovah and about Abraham and when he was about to sacrifice he was narrating that yeah and he says when I said that a humble little woman for the first time I have said it even before but it must find its place amen [Music] and for the first time this ever happened to a human being meaning we are coming to that meaning that there's not just a saying the manifestation the prophet speaks about the the foreign [Music] I mean I mean now Charlie but that look how the third pool comes in not through science because everything is coming from back there [Music] where is my book here now okay okay I'm sorry because I've got don't worry I'm closing yes okay uh I've got a book here let me try to find it unveiling of the one of the great books here when you see the weight you made manifestations I wonder if you have seen the father let me read to you this party yeah okay I think it should be page [Music] this all right firstly let's take it here look what the wage it is being valid through these ages according to what God Said oh yeah it was opened in the last days those Seven Seals should be would be broke amen amen but it was that was the message that was finished it's the revelation of the seven series the ages and the full thing would come into view of the people the hour of their seventh angel message all the Mysteries should be made known all right we are preparing for something amen why you say okay why you look at the man and say he is there he didn't go to Messenger all right what makes you too okay that way I it's like this the Lord Jesus says no men can come to me except the father who has sent to me [Music] I'm chilling that's what I'm doing huh what's the meaning of that no man can come to me except he is coming to me from where I came here that's the only way he can come to me amen if I am from the father and somebody wants to come to me you will also be coming from the father otherwise it won't work no one can come to me except the Father Tell the health y okay amen I think we can all hear that yeah otherwise no men can come I mean that's why you say you know I preached to him I gave him the spoken words I did this I did that he is not convinced because you have given him the spoken word it says no end can come no one can come accept the father foreign [Music] [Music] that's right when he comes then we meet again because we are from the same time Peter Petro when he he saw him he said the words of eternal life yeah okay amen the Samaritan women he was a prostitute but fella God has already predestinated it doesn't say to me this nation is like that I can smoke because I'm produced she didn't know about politicism only she had something in here I knew the Messiah is coming he will tell me [Applause] that's what that was inhale waiting for the time of the manifestation the time was manifested [Music] foreign [Music] is the only city that saw melchized God in the form of melchized we have you ever heard any milk um he has read out of a certain book he was talking about them [Applause] [Music] you know I heard the prophet seeing I am something in me you listen we've read that everybody something in me brother brilliant met that melchized let's put it foreign foreign [Music] yeah yeah I'm in I'm in he wasn't me but yet Abraham said you are when this is melchized hey now here is another thing again amen uh what's the answer now the prophecies something in me something in abrahamas amen okay amen but something engineers the only person who can
