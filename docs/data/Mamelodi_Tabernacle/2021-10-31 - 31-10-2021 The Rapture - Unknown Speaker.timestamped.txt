[32:00] a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[32:03] that the last time
[32:05] for the chapter shall sound
[32:19] yes
[32:43] believe in jesus will god bring with him
[32:47] for this we say unto you by the way of

[32:51] that we which are alive and remain unto
[32:54] the coming of the lord
[32:56] shall not prevent them which are saved
[33:00] for the lord himself shall descend from
[33:02] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[33:05] the archangel
[33:07] and with the trump of god and the dead
[33:10] culture rise first
[33:12] then we which are alive and remain shall
[33:16] be caught up together with them in the
[33:18] clouds to meet the lord in the end
[33:21] and so shall we
[33:35] okay
[33:39] i'm just waiting for the brother
[33:43] let us bow our heads
[34:18] in jesus christ's name amen
[34:21] you may be seated
[34:25] all right
[34:28] i'm just waiting for a message
[34:32] before we start off
[34:35] amen
[34:47] okay
[34:50] [Music]
[34:53] announcement is that
[34:57] the flight
[34:59] is
[35:01] from here to
[35:02] the new jerusalem
[35:09] the altitude
[35:13] is the seventh seal
[35:18] amen
[35:20] so if you are told that this is the end
[35:23] of the seventh seal you know that
[35:29] we are just
[35:30] almost there
[35:34] okay
[35:36] now
[35:37] i'm i will start by reading some things
[35:40] here
[35:42] the first thing it speaks of them that
[35:44] are asleep
[35:50] then i have it oh do we have it here
[35:54] oh yeah we have a cloud and
[35:57] clouds cloud the tree and i see the eye
[36:01] there
[36:02] it's also part of this morning
[36:05] the clouds
[36:07] the tree
[36:09] and the eye
[36:11] yeah part of this
[36:13] morning
[36:14] because in jerusalem
[36:18] we are going to see things
[36:21] and i think they are trying to pro
[36:24] to pour three years
[36:28] the tree in jerusalem
[36:32] because the light in jerusalem is christ
[36:35] himself
[36:39] don't worry about the umbrella or
[36:41] redeemers there
[36:45] amen
[36:47] we want to have a site like we have here
[36:52] and
[36:53] what confronts me the most
[36:56] is that i was told that
[37:00] when you are there
[37:03] there will still be the pleiades
[37:08] and
[37:09] some other forms
[37:12] of
[37:13] different
[37:15] words
[37:17] i understand
[37:20] but i'm told that
[37:25] should i want to go to the pleiades
[37:30] i don't need any form of
[37:34] transport your support
[37:39] because i will just travel like in my
[37:42] thought
[37:47] you know this
[37:48] body is a hindrance
[37:53] is a cover
[37:57] it is a mask
[38:00] but
[38:02] even as i'm standing here
[38:05] i can visualize my study room
[38:09] i can visualize my house
[38:13] but somebody else who has never been to
[38:16] my house
[38:20] must be
[38:21] must have a guide
[38:24] but not me because it is my house
[38:30] it is in me
[38:34] so
[38:34] leaving this place after service
[38:38] i will just follow the vision
[38:41] of the house that i have in me
[38:46] do you understand that
[38:49] when we were in heaven
[38:53] and
[38:56] god brought us here
[39:02] to worship him
[39:05] and we were planted like trees
[39:10] amen
[39:11] but he has put also in us
[39:16] something that is called
[39:18] soul
[39:22] and in that soul
[39:26] there is one
[39:27] we call eternity
[39:33] now that's why we know our way home
[39:40] as the bible says
[39:42] for our citizenship
[39:46] is in heaven
[39:49] i know i don't need a visa to go back to
[39:52] my home
[40:01] he's always there to guide me
[40:06] all right
[40:07] now
[40:08] listen now as we read
[40:12] and
[40:12] paul was the first
[40:15] messenger
[40:18] and you know how he
[40:20] he went to the
[40:23] third world
[40:24] set heaven
[40:29] did you do you know that scripture
[40:33] he says
[40:34] i know a man in christ
[40:40] who went to the third
[40:42] heaven
[40:43] [Music]
[40:45] it is again called the heaven of heavens
[40:53] and the bible of jesus it says
[40:58] you know when he died
[41:01] he went down
[41:04] to the outermost
[41:08] and from the outermost
[41:11] the book of luke says
[41:13] then he went to the highest heaven
[41:19] when he goes down he really goes down
[41:23] when he goes up he really goes up
[41:29] amen
[41:30] that's why
[41:33] we are looking at this now let's let's
[41:35] look at this for a few minutes
[41:38] we'll continue until
[41:40] we come to
[41:44] the
[41:45] place
[41:48] now the scripture says
[41:52] i show you
[41:52] [Music]
[41:54] say it
[41:57] and me stirring
[42:00] mystery is something that is not known
[42:03] to everybody
[42:09] is only known to those whom the lord has
[42:12] chosen
[42:18] and they are the keepers of the
[42:20] mysteries of god
[42:25] the real believers of this message
[42:31] are they keepers
[42:34] of the mysteries of god
[42:38] the keepers of the title deeds
[42:44] because
[42:46] god has given them the title deed
[42:52] because the title did
[42:55] with the title did you know who you are
[43:01] where you come from where you are going
[43:04] where you are
[43:06] that's the
[43:08] title deed holder
[43:12] a worshiper should be a worshipper with
[43:14] a title deed
[43:16] [Music]
[43:18] the person who knows where is god who is
[43:21] god
[43:25] he should know that he is coming
[43:29] and he should know what to do when he is
[43:31] coming
[43:34] and he should know the secret the
[43:36] mystery of his coming
[43:40] you can't make preparations unless you
[43:43] know the secret
[43:46] the preparations are made only after we
[43:49] have received the secret
[43:54] the mystery of his coming
[43:58] that's why we see the signs today
[44:02] they are pointing to that direction
[44:05] [Applause]
[44:09] uh just a couple of days
[44:13] ago
[44:16] and
[44:18] i
[44:21] but anyhow let me say it in this manner
[44:27] i faced some
[44:29] what do you call
[44:34] larry
[44:35] [Music]
[44:46] and the occupants of these things are
[44:49] called the aliens
[44:54] i was facing aliens
[44:57] one night
[45:01] i was called that there's aliens
[45:05] all right i know you don't know what i'm
[45:07] talking about don't worry
[45:10] but anyhow because it is i know it i'm
[45:13] saying it
[45:16] but if you don't understand it
[45:19] you need not to worry
[45:21] i'm just telling you about what i know
[45:24] peter said one day
[45:27] we are eyewitnesses
[45:30] we were with him on the mountain
[45:33] [Applause]
[45:34] and that's why they saw moses and elijah
[45:39] and peter
[45:41] didn't argue with anybody
[45:44] he only said
[45:45] we are
[45:47] eyewitnesses

[47:12] where is that scripture again i don't
[47:14] have my
[47:15] my other bible here
[47:19] but i want you to
[47:22] look at this
[47:23] carefully
[47:27] when we die
[47:30] as the prophet
[47:33] has
[47:34] taught me this
[47:37] the word of god
[47:39] when we die
[47:41] anyhow i know
[47:43] that this body
[47:45] is sentenced to death
[47:50] every time a child is born the first
[47:53] thing done by the parents
[47:58] is by trying for a security or what to
[48:02] do
[48:04] against dance again
[48:06] with chi
[48:08] because the first lily please
[48:10] [Music]
[48:11] hey value
[48:14] a
[48:18] man are going to be judged
[48:23] god is going to judge you
[48:28] for your deeds
[48:32] you are very well known
[48:35] you are known very well
[48:38] but let me read the scripture now
[48:41] i i'm not saying somebody should fear
[48:47] if you are a child of god
[48:49] there's nothing to fear
[48:56] let me repeat this
[48:58] if you are a child of god
[49:00] there is nothing to fear
[49:08] if you fear means there is something
[49:10] wrong
[49:13] let me let us read now that was the
[49:16] selenius
[49:20] chapter four
[49:22] today we'll just take this part
[49:28] then by god grace will
[49:31] but i would not
[49:34] have you be ignorant brethren concerning
[49:37] them who are
[49:38] asleep
[49:45] that you may sorrow
[49:48] not even as others who have no hope
[49:55] [Music]
[49:58] you know should you announce
[50:00] death of
[50:02] somebody or family member to somebody he
[50:05] drops everything
[50:06] [Music]
[50:08] and all that amen
[50:16] [Music]
[50:18] those without hope
[50:24] you know my
[50:27] let me not mention but it's one of my
[50:29] relatives
[50:31] he said about me and my elder brother
[50:37] otherwise
[50:38] our family
[50:44] why she said this
[50:46] it is because every time we were sent
[50:53] to take the message you offer
[50:57] one disease
[50:58] to somebody
[51:03] you know they would want you to knock
[51:06] and going inside their house like this
[51:12] then they know already that
[51:17] you can command
[51:21] because
[51:22] yeah
[51:24] but now we as christians
[51:26] i just come in
[51:31] and you know so and so
[51:33] i i'm told that she has just passed away
[51:38] army
[51:39] now that's why they said
[51:41] me and my brother
[51:43] we don't fear death
[51:48] i would
[51:50] concerning them who are asleep that you
[51:54] may sorrow not just like at home
[51:58] in the morning you wake up but some are
[52:00] still asleep
[52:08] amen what do you do you just wait for
[52:10] them also to wake up
[52:14] so that you can meet and continue with
[52:17] the daily duties and so forth
[52:29] okay
[52:30] for if we believe that jesus died and
[52:33] rose again even so them
[52:35] who are asleep in
[52:39] jesus
[52:48] take note of that
[52:50] he slipped in
[52:54] like lazarus
[52:56] was sleeping
[52:58] but in jesus christ
[53:00] [Music]
[53:02] and who's that woman she said to jesus
[53:05] was it martha
[53:07] he said to the lord jesus
[53:16] i know that lazarus
[53:20] will rise again
[53:22] but in the last days
[53:24] and the large the lord jesus said what
[53:28] did he say
[53:31] i am
[53:34] the resurrection
[53:38] amen
[53:41] you know brother branham said one thing
[53:43] one day
[53:44] now i've seen it in the bible
[53:47] that death
[53:49] and life cannot
[53:50] come together
[53:57] life came to a home in the form of jesus
[54:04] and there was a themself that died
[54:07] [Music]
[54:09] and when he entered there were mourners
[54:12] in there
[54:15] and he said give way
[54:19] the resurrection has come
[54:22] the resurrection in the form of a man
[54:26] the walking the talking resurrection
[54:29] which is
[54:30] jesus christ
[54:32] was coming
[54:34] to that house of sorrow
[54:40] every time jesus is here all things are
[54:43] possible
[54:45] amen
[54:46] there is no death there's no hunger
[54:49] there's no as long as he is here
[54:52] [Music]
[54:53] now let us invite him in our hearts
[54:55] today
[54:57] and and not only invite him
[55:00] but let's keep him
[55:07] don't just invite him
[55:10] but keep him
[55:14] amen
[55:17] then
[55:18] he entered
[55:22] make way for the resurrection
[55:26] amen
[55:28] the resurrection was working
[55:31] and talking
[55:33] and came in
[55:36] then and the damsel was there
[55:40] and then he just called them sir
[55:46] amen
[55:48] he didn't pray
[55:50] he called them
[55:52] [Music]
[55:54] just as we are the cold ones
[55:57] [Applause]
[55:59] now death there's no death for us
[56:02] anymore
[56:03] because he has already called us
[56:06] [Applause]
[56:08] amen and that's why the bible says
[56:22] we have passed
[56:24] already
[56:26] because our names
[56:36] you go through things
[56:44] you are going through things
[56:47] then listen
[56:49] for
[56:51] hey
[56:53] for if we believe that jesus
[56:57] died and rose again
[57:02] even them so who are asleep also who are
[57:06] asleep in jesus
[57:08] god will bring
[57:11] with him
[57:19] amen
[57:21] with
[57:26] but the dead in christ
[57:31] are in christ
[57:35] the dead in christ meaning
[57:38] they are in christ
[57:41] absent from their bodies
[57:44] [Music]
[57:47] because a christian do not die
[57:51] it is your body that dies
[57:55] amen
[57:56] you are spirit
[57:59] soul
[58:01] and body
[58:02] the body is made of
[58:06] dust we can beautify it
[58:10] we can do whatever we do
[58:14] but it is aging
[58:17] [Music]
[58:18] until one day
[58:33] that is the body
[58:36] she is of age now
[58:39] [Music]
[58:46] is she still a celebrity
[58:49] know she has done past that
[58:52] because multifaceted ladybug
[58:57] amen
[59:01] you will stand up before the almighty
[59:04] god
[59:09] listening listen for this we say unto
[59:13] you by the word of the lord that we also
[59:17] who are alive and remain
[59:21] unto the coming of the lord
[59:24] that's why i have it here with me
[59:28] them that are asleep
[59:31] and we which are alive
[59:36] take note of that
[59:38] we are going to follow that
[59:41] and them that are asleep
[59:43] they are still part of us
[59:46] you will see but in the sixth dimension
[59:51] and when the
[59:52] the prophet of god arrived there
[59:56] and he said where is jesus
[59:59] i want to see jesus
[1:00:01] and they said he is just in the seventh
[1:00:05] dimension
[1:00:07] and one day he will come down
[1:00:11] and pick us
[1:00:12] up then we will come together
[1:00:17] for the bible says
[1:00:19] he will come with them we are going to
[1:00:21] read
[1:00:23] amen
[1:00:24] and they will meet him in the air
[1:00:28] he will never set his foot here
[1:00:32] but will meet him in the air
[1:00:34] [Applause]
[1:00:35] [Music]
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:38] and that will be the end of the is
[1:00:41] because we
[1:00:42] we have here two things
[1:00:45] we have the three and a half years
[1:00:48] of christ's prophecy
[1:00:50] [Music]
[1:00:51] then after
[1:00:53] we have the three and a half years
[1:00:56] which is called the tribulation period
[1:00:59] but that is of satan's
[1:01:03] period
[1:01:06] after the rapture
[1:01:10] did you know
[1:01:11] you hear the bible saying this
[1:01:15] revelation chapter 12 verse
[1:01:18] 10 12.
[1:01:22] verse 10.
[1:01:24] therefore
[1:01:25] verse 12 years
[1:01:27] therefore
[1:01:28] rejoice ye heavens and neither dwell in
[1:01:32] them
[1:01:33] woe to the inhabitants of the earth and
[1:01:37] of the sea for the devil is come down
[1:01:40] unto you having great wrath
[1:01:44] because he knows that
[1:01:46] he has but a short time
[1:02:04] i wonder if he has
[1:02:07] announced
[1:02:09] given this report to his followers
[1:02:17] addressing them to say
[1:02:20] my brothers and sisters
[1:02:22] i have my time is short
[1:02:27] has he has he announced that to his
[1:02:29] church
[1:02:32] no they don't know about it
[1:02:39] he follows god
[1:02:43] okay let's
[1:02:46] look at these brothers and sisters
[1:02:48] i'm reading
[1:02:53] who and to
[1:02:56] say it
[1:02:58] are you here with me
[1:03:01] yeah that is verse 10
[1:03:03] 12 verse 12
[1:03:05] and
[1:03:08] my scripture and now you you come here
[1:03:10] again
[1:03:13] i i i verse
[1:03:17] 13
[1:03:19] i'm in chapter 13
[1:03:21] and i stood upon
[1:03:24] the
[1:03:25] scent of the sea
[1:03:27] and they saw a beast rise up out of the
[1:03:31] sea
[1:03:32] having
[1:03:34] seven heads and welcome to that
[1:03:38] the beast out of
[1:03:41] out of the sea
[1:03:46] all right
[1:03:48] as i say
[1:03:51] somebody said
[1:03:53] they were talking
[1:03:55] i was just close to them
[1:03:57] saying
[1:03:58] if then
[1:04:01] maybe like
[1:04:02] talking about how people
[1:04:04] go for their rituals
[1:04:10] initiation and to the river and so forth
[1:04:15] and the one it's a pastor i respect that
[1:04:18] pastor
[1:04:21] he said should one go in the water he
[1:04:23] will drown
[1:04:28] you know
[1:04:30] so he was referring to
[1:04:33] this
[1:04:35] underworld things and so forth
[1:04:40] then in the sea in the river
[1:04:45] there's water there's fishy fish
[1:04:49] crocodiles they don't drown
[1:04:54] amen now i refer to this
[1:05:00] coming
[1:05:01] we saw a beast rise up this beast
[1:05:05] we know to be
[1:05:07] a man here
[1:05:12] a beast
[1:05:14] coming out
[1:05:16] then if you go and you'll hear this
[1:05:19] beast
[1:05:20] talking
[1:05:22] i want i wonder how these beasts survive
[1:05:25] drowning
[1:05:33] why is caesar
[1:05:38] but he came out of the water
[1:05:45] now going down rebel
[1:05:48] you realize that
[1:05:51] this beast
[1:05:53] because we are coming now to the
[1:05:56] reincarnation of things
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:00] then you realize that
[1:06:02] this beast
[1:06:03] is a man
[1:06:05] today
[1:06:07] incarnated that is satan
[1:06:10] well all right but yeah
[1:06:14] i i know it's easy
[1:06:18] verse 4 today i'll just take this small
[1:06:20] part here
[1:06:21] and they worshiped the dragon
[1:06:25] who gave power unto the beast
[1:06:30] and they worshiped the beast
[1:06:34] and
[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:06:37] saying
[1:06:38] who is like the beast
[1:06:42] who is able to make war with him
[1:06:46] you see they are referring to a
[1:06:49] man
[1:06:53] but out of the sea
[1:06:58] why he didn't drown
[1:07:02] and there was given unto him a mouth
[1:07:05] speaking great things and blasphemies
[1:07:08] and the power was given unto him to
[1:07:10] continue
[1:07:13] and two months how long is that
[1:07:21] three and a half years
[1:07:24] the lord jesus said he's three and a
[1:07:26] half years
[1:07:30] he has his
[1:07:32] satan also has three and a half years
[1:07:36] then that's why it says
[1:07:38] after the rapture
[1:07:45] of the earth
[1:07:48] and the sea
[1:07:50] and you realize revelation chapter 21
[1:07:54] there is no mercy
[1:07:58] there's no place for you to hide
[1:08:04] no mercy
[1:08:06] and because
[1:08:09] he's been running his office
[1:08:12] from down
[1:08:14] we have three spheres
[1:08:18] heaven as
[1:08:21] an anger
[1:08:26] but the people are allergic to the under
[1:08:29] where they wait and
[1:08:36] did you hear that
[1:08:39] now
[1:08:40] john says
[1:08:42] every creature hated me
[1:08:48] do you know that scripture
[1:08:50] read it
[1:08:52] every creature hated me
[1:08:57] now read it will tell us creatures where
[1:09:17] okay read it
[1:09:21] you read it brother
[1:09:46] forever right
[1:09:50] john because
[1:09:53] he he saw him who had the book in his
[1:09:56] right hand
[1:10:02] who has won the battle
[1:10:06] because this book belonged to adam
[1:10:10] when adam forfeited it
[1:10:14] the original
[1:10:16] holder
[1:10:20] the keeper
[1:10:22] took it
[1:10:24] so that saturn would not see the
[1:10:27] mysteries of god
[1:10:31] that's why satan don't know about the
[1:10:34] seventh sin
[1:10:37] he doesn't know about the third pool
[1:10:40] because these are the mysteries of god
[1:10:44] that's why the rapture itself is a
[1:10:47] secret
[1:10:50] because it says in the twinkling of an
[1:10:52] eye
[1:10:54] meaning that
[1:10:56] saturn will see nothing
[1:10:58] that is in a twinkling of an eye
[1:11:01] but here
[1:11:03] now that the beast
[1:11:06] here it is now
[1:11:08] it's a man
[1:11:10] called
[1:11:11] the beast because
[1:11:13] that is
[1:11:15] incarnation
[1:11:20] and also
[1:11:22] the lord jesus
[1:11:24] did the same thing john 14 20
[1:11:28] at that day
[1:11:30] you shall know that
[1:11:33] i am in you
[1:11:37] now he doesn't speak of the holy ghost
[1:11:41] he says i
[1:11:43] myself now
[1:11:46] i'll be
[1:11:47] in you
[1:11:49] and you
[1:11:51] in me
[1:11:54] you read
[1:11:55] john chapter 14 verse 20.
[1:11:59] it will tell you that
[1:12:01] but he says
[1:12:02] at that day
[1:12:04] there is a day
[1:12:06] when you will know
[1:12:09] that he is in you
[1:12:12] and you are in him
[1:12:14] there is a day
[1:12:17] you should know
[1:12:18] that he is in you
[1:12:21] and you in him
[1:12:22] [Applause]
[1:12:27] you should know
[1:12:28] [Applause]
[1:12:30] when will you know
[1:12:32] who who is in you
[1:12:35] you is your ruler
[1:12:38] amen what is that in your heart
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:47] okay
[1:12:49] those who are in him
[1:12:53] and he is in them
[1:12:58] they are called the true worshipers
[1:13:02] they worship god in spirit and in truth
[1:13:06] [Applause]
[1:13:09] they are not just worshipers
[1:13:12] but they worship him in
[1:13:15] [Applause]
[1:13:16] spirit
[1:13:18] and because there's so many spirits
[1:13:21] it says in truth
[1:13:25] and what is the truth
[1:13:29] it is his revelation
[1:13:33] he gives you revelation
[1:13:36] that means he's giving you the truth
[1:13:42] otherwise you'll keep on guessing
[1:13:48] [Music]
[1:13:50] they say the seventh seal is not
[1:13:52] revealed the seventh is not revealed
[1:13:55] and i read there it says
[1:13:57] that the seventh engine flew to me
[1:14:02] and that is the seventh scene
[1:14:08] brother
[1:14:11] that seventh season seen
[1:14:14] only few people
[1:14:16] have
[1:14:17] had him
[1:14:18] saying that
[1:14:21] only few
[1:14:22] that seventh seal
[1:14:24] flew straight to me
[1:14:29] and that is the seventh seal
[1:14:36] i was picked up it says
[1:14:41] your your book
[1:14:43] which book
[1:14:46] standing in the game
[1:14:50] you don't know which book
[1:14:53] okay
[1:14:54] standing in the game brother
[1:14:58] he says
[1:14:59] i was picked up
[1:15:01] by an angel
[1:15:04] to go
[1:15:08] and
[1:15:10] now don't miss
[1:15:11] this that like
[1:15:14] all the time this thing is missed
[1:15:18] i go worse i went west
[1:15:22] to open the seals for gordon
[1:15:29] i'm going to repeat it again
[1:15:32] i went west
[1:15:36] to open the seals
[1:15:40] for god
[1:15:43] now
[1:15:44] it will never pass
[1:15:46] a predestinated soul
[1:15:53] but
[1:15:54] some
[1:15:55] will hear the reading
[1:15:59] but will not hear the word
[1:16:06] you get what i mean
[1:16:08] some will hear the
[1:16:09] reading
[1:16:11] of that word
[1:16:13] but they would not hear the word
[1:16:18] because the word is god speaking to you
[1:16:24] but if the word says
[1:16:27] i was picked up
[1:16:30] and
[1:16:32] i went worse to westward
[1:16:37] to open the seals
[1:16:40] for god
[1:16:43] i can sit here the whole day
[1:16:46] i was picked up
[1:16:50] and went westward
[1:16:53] to open the seals
[1:16:55] for god
[1:16:59] we read the
[1:17:01] part last week i think in another week
[1:17:03] and that week and that week
[1:17:06] it says
[1:17:08] he tore
[1:17:10] off the seals
[1:17:15] and gave it to the seventh angel
[1:17:18] messenger
[1:17:22] for to reveal it
[1:17:25] to the church
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:30] i can stand here the whole day
[1:17:34] the lord the lamp toe of the seal
[1:17:38] sent it down to the seventh seal
[1:17:42] that is that book
[1:17:44] this book was in the hands of adam
[1:17:48] the manual book is when you buy a car
[1:17:50] you get the manual book
[1:17:55] so
[1:17:56] adam
[1:17:57] received that manual book from god
[1:18:01] in the garden of eden
[1:18:04] and it had
[1:18:05] it has part that says
[1:18:09] you can eat from this tree but not from
[1:18:11] this tree
[1:18:13] that was the manual book he had
[1:18:17] amen
[1:18:18] but then he fulfilled the book
[1:18:22] because a preacher came
[1:18:24] there a scientific preacher
[1:18:29] and said what did god say
[1:18:32] and
[1:18:33] the woman said
[1:18:34] god said we can eat from this tree
[1:18:38] but not from this one
[1:18:40] and
[1:18:42] that scientist men say
[1:18:44] that that was the serpent
[1:18:47] not a snake
[1:18:51] if was not deceived by the snake
[1:18:57] we've got snakes here around
[1:19:00] amen
[1:19:01] he saw
[1:19:02] but he was deceived
[1:19:04] by an upright being
[1:19:09] even when it speaks it will tell us we
[1:19:12] are still going to read the beast
[1:19:14] the dragoon
[1:19:16] but referring to a man
[1:19:22] amen
[1:19:23] so when you forfeited that book
[1:19:27] the original holder or owner of the book
[1:19:33] because that book is called the title
[1:19:35] deed
[1:19:38] to eternal life
[1:19:41] our names
[1:19:43] are written in that book
[1:19:47] not in a church book
[1:19:51] amen
[1:19:52] that's why
[1:19:53] i don't go to a church because then god
[1:19:56] must worship there
[1:20:00] no
[1:20:03] actually
[1:20:04] the bible says
[1:20:06] for
[1:20:07] by one spirit
[1:20:10] are we baptized
[1:20:13] into the body
[1:20:15] into
[1:20:16] easy
[1:20:19] do you know what is church
[1:20:24] it's not something formed by men
[1:20:30] our
[1:20:43] satan is going to break that one
[1:20:47] because
[1:20:48] as i'm saying
[1:20:50] for me to start any church
[1:20:54] i must have the blood of god
[1:20:57] because it is the blood of god that
[1:21:00] started the church
[1:21:04] amen
[1:21:05] now if somebody starts a church
[1:21:09] without the blood of god
[1:21:12] that is human blood church
[1:21:16] satan will bless you to pieces
[1:21:21] all right
[1:21:22] brother
[1:21:24] don't ever take a direction without
[1:21:27] being directed
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:39] there's some wizard who can misdirect
[1:21:41] you
[1:21:46] that's why the wise
[1:21:49] men and women
[1:21:53] if you come and say why is
[1:22:11] amen
[1:22:14] god church
[1:22:17] for
[1:22:18] i will give you
[1:22:23] pestering shepherds
[1:22:28] now in the morning
[1:22:30] i was also a head boy
[1:22:34] in the morning
[1:22:36] it is
[1:22:37] the head boy
[1:22:40] already
[1:22:42] the shepherd
[1:22:44] who will drive the ship out oxen and so
[1:22:47] forth
[1:22:50] for the pastures
[1:22:53] what if he says he drives them out of
[1:22:57] the crawl
[1:22:59] and some stand and say hey um
[1:23:15] no a ship can look after itself
[1:23:21] no
[1:23:22] the best talent of a sheep
[1:23:25] it is that it can't look after itself
[1:23:28] [Applause]
[1:23:29] and it's a good talent
[1:23:33] when it can look after itself
[1:23:36] then there is a shepherd
[1:23:41] david was a shepherd
[1:23:44] and as the prophet of god says
[1:23:47] shepherds are suspicious
[1:23:52] should he see grass moving like this
[1:23:56] because he is a shepherd
[1:23:58] he will start to pick up his spear
[1:24:02] pick up his sword
[1:24:05] amen
[1:24:06] when we are told
[1:24:09] that some people have planned to do this
[1:24:11] and this in the church
[1:24:14] we quickly draw our thoughts
[1:24:18] we are shepherds
[1:24:20] looking after the sheep
[1:24:22] but a sheep would go without a shepherd
[1:24:24] is going astray
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:38] they are known
[1:24:41] of being heroes
[1:24:45] when i was in
[1:24:46] malawi we were told and
[1:24:48] the pastor they brought us a disc on
[1:24:51] that
[1:24:57] uh he told us you know the messiah tribe
[1:25:01] even
[1:25:02] lions fear them
[1:25:08] now we watched it
[1:25:11] what they do
[1:25:13] they will come
[1:25:15] make a cycle around a lion
[1:25:18] that has devoured
[1:25:20] their sheep or whatever
[1:25:24] now
[1:25:25] then they start their song
[1:25:28] coming closer
[1:25:30] moving together
[1:25:32] the thing is
[1:25:34] the elders should move together
[1:25:40] amen so they come moving together
[1:25:44] just like that
[1:25:46] then when the the lion will start look
[1:25:48] around
[1:25:50] and
[1:25:51] the first thing the lion will see is the
[1:25:53] unity
[1:26:00] the first thing satan has to notice
[1:26:05] among us is the unique
[1:26:11] amen
[1:26:12] that is the first thing
[1:26:15] you carry a gun it's not a problem
[1:26:19] even if you are carrying a gun
[1:26:21] it's not a problem for the enemy
[1:26:25] but but if you come in one unit
[1:26:29] that's
[1:26:30] trouble sends
[1:26:32] a
[1:26:33] message to the enemy
[1:26:37] now this messiah tribe
[1:26:40] they come like that
[1:26:43] now they make sure
[1:26:47] none of them
[1:26:49] will drop out
[1:26:53] of that unity
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:26:56] of that cycle
[1:26:59] do you know about the cycle of life
[1:27:03] when we are all together in one accord
[1:27:07] [Music]
[1:27:09] amen
[1:27:11] satan
[1:27:13] stands no chance there
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:16] i've lent it there
[1:27:19] now a lion
[1:27:22] if you look around
[1:27:24] the same thing that there's danger here
[1:27:27] because these people look alike
[1:27:31] [Music]
[1:27:33] they are in one mood
[1:27:37] one heart one spirit
[1:27:40] one gospel one baptism
[1:27:43] one one love
[1:27:47] amen
[1:27:49] it makes such a mighty power
[1:27:51] [Applause]
[1:27:55] but should one drop out
[1:27:59] the lion goes after him
[1:28:03] brother don't drop out
[1:28:05] [Music]
[1:28:11] once you drop out
[1:28:13] the lion comes after you
[1:28:15] [Applause]
[1:28:17] because
[1:28:18] it can sense that now you are alone
[1:28:27] that's why
[1:28:30] amen
[1:28:33] joshua said
[1:28:35] stay in the middle of the road
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:39] don't go to the right don't go to the
[1:28:41] left
[1:28:44] and the prophet say
[1:28:46] when he shows he
[1:28:48] he saw once one ship
[1:28:53] moving out
[1:28:55] dropping out of the
[1:28:57] airline
[1:28:59] he said
[1:29:01] go back
[1:29:06] he never said first pray dude that
[1:29:10] go to the mountain
[1:29:12] pray three times a day and they said
[1:29:14] step back
[1:29:16] [Applause]
[1:29:21] if you are iron
[1:29:30] amen you need to collect connected to
[1:29:32] the power
[1:29:33] [Music]
[1:29:37] once you unplug it
[1:29:41] it won't save the purpose
[1:29:46] if you say my hand doesn't work
[1:29:49] the first thing they plug it back
[1:29:54] don't you say you know these these days
[1:29:56] you know i don't feel like going to the
[1:29:58] service i don't feel they say plug back
[1:30:06] because
[1:30:07] you were not like this
[1:30:15] i'm saying
[1:30:16] the first thing you'll start to blame
[1:30:18] the people

[1:35:42] son of the living god
[1:35:47] and the lord jesus said
[1:35:55] and the lord jesus said

[1:36:45] him
[1:36:48] not from flesh and blood

[1:37:01] holy chamom
[1:37:18] [Music]
[1:37:25] i was travelling in a train

[1:37:32] there
[1:37:34] one
[1:37:35] very known to me
[1:37:46] i knew that he's referring to me because
[1:37:48] he knows me
[1:37:52] now but he's talking to this one
[1:37:55] you know in the train sitting like this
[1:37:56] i'm facing them
[1:37:59] we greeted one another hello
[1:38:02] but after that
[1:38:04] it was time
[1:38:06] now for him to scroll to me and say
[1:38:08] things and so forth
[1:38:10] yeah
[1:38:12] and then
[1:38:13] hey whatever
[1:38:43] would give me someone more about you
[1:38:54] amen
[1:39:00] now i'm closing with this
[1:39:03] we haven't preached about it now
[1:39:06] i was introducing to you
[1:39:12] one says
[1:39:14] them that are asleep
[1:39:17] and one other one says
[1:39:20] we which are alive
[1:39:24] we are going to
[1:39:26] get into that and look into that
[1:39:29] there's that those
[1:39:32] brother
[1:39:33] but i can show something here
[1:39:36] in closing here where
[1:39:39] how you operate this thing like this
[1:39:50] now we have this here
[1:39:54] are you together now
[1:39:57] we that are alive
[1:40:01] it's this side
[1:40:03] now we have here
[1:40:06] them that are
[1:40:08] asleep
[1:40:10] now we are going to dwell on that
[1:40:13] all this that you see here
[1:40:16] we're going to touch them coming down
[1:40:20] like this one let me just give you a
[1:40:23] glimpse of things we are going to look
[1:40:24] at
[1:40:26] where is that book here
[1:40:30] page triple one
[1:40:32] then i finish this one we close the
[1:40:35] service by god's grace
[1:40:37] we are going to prepare for ourselves to
[1:40:39] come to the service
[1:40:42] it says
[1:40:44] there was a time
[1:40:47] and that is cod
[1:40:50] that the people didn't go into the
[1:40:53] presence of god when they died
[1:40:59] they justified
[1:41:01] that was in the old testament
[1:41:04] they went into a place called paradise
[1:41:10] and then the source of the just
[1:41:14] waited in paradise
[1:41:17] but paradise
[1:41:19] was a place where god kept the souls in
[1:41:22] like a dreamland
[1:41:27] until the blood of jesus christ was shed
[1:41:32] for the blood of the bulls and goes
[1:41:34] would not take away sin
[1:41:40] it only covered up sin
[1:41:44] by jesus blood
[1:41:46] takes away sin
[1:41:51] so the old testament blood
[1:41:54] could not
[1:41:56] take away sin
[1:41:59] but could only cover
[1:42:01] but the new testament blood
[1:42:04] do not cover
[1:42:07] but it takes away sin
[1:42:12] are you there
[1:42:14] so you notice he died at calvary
[1:42:20] now those
[1:42:21] those uh
[1:42:24] all right and
[1:42:26] on his return
[1:42:30] he brought out from the grave those dead
[1:42:34] saints
[1:42:38] but you should know that the saints are
[1:42:41] actually not in the grave by their
[1:42:44] bodies
[1:42:50] you see because the resurrection
[1:42:55] the stages of it
[1:43:00] it says
[1:43:02] the lord said
[1:43:03] father received my spirit
[1:43:09] then peter as we are coming to read it
[1:43:13] peter says when he died
[1:43:16] his soul
[1:43:18] went
[1:43:20] to the uttermost
[1:43:23] the spirit
[1:43:26] to the father
[1:43:28] the body
[1:43:30] to the grave
[1:43:33] amen
[1:43:34] now you are going to see here
[1:43:37] when he went down now
[1:43:40] when they were celebrating his death
[1:43:44] that's when he was down there preaching
[1:43:50] preaching
[1:43:51] to the souls
[1:43:54] down there
[1:43:56] because
[1:43:57] during that time
[1:43:59] when he was preaching there
[1:44:02] it says that
[1:44:05] because you see
[1:44:08] the judgment hasn't yet come
[1:44:12] it is coming
[1:44:14] and there is no banning hell now
[1:44:21] because satan
[1:44:23] is there
[1:44:25] it's not benign
[1:44:27] it will bend
[1:44:29] when at the time of judgment
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:33] then the hell will start to burn
[1:44:40] the fire will be so strong
[1:44:44] even those
[1:44:46] operating under
[1:44:49] will come running
[1:44:52] the fire will start down there
[1:44:55] as the prophet of god says a fire that
[1:44:58] will even bend water
[1:45:02] and peter saint peter
[1:45:05] apostle peter speaks of it
[1:45:08] we will read it
[1:45:09] that fire
[1:45:11] amen don't compare that fire
[1:45:15] with this fire here
[1:45:19] amen
[1:45:21] the fire here
[1:45:22] will only bend the body
[1:45:25] and immediately the soul will
[1:45:30] leave the body
[1:45:32] but that fire
[1:45:34] will benefit the soul
[1:45:37] [Applause]
[1:45:39] amen
[1:45:41] that is the fire of god
