[22:22] may the Lord bless him and their family
[22:30] God bless them
[22:31] all right
[22:34] I think we are going back to our book
[22:39] you know this uh
[22:42] the seventh
[22:44] Church age
[22:46] [Music]
[22:54] the prophet of God
[22:57] adding
[22:59] he is outside that's where the prophet
[23:01] of God says
[23:05] kicked out
[23:07] of the church
[23:09] okay I mean that's why
[23:13] that's why the Bible says we will gather
[23:16] in him because as he is kicked out of
[23:20] the church
[23:22] there are those who know that he is
[23:25] being kicked out
[23:29] and
[23:31] they follow him outside
[23:34] of the church and they have
[23:40] I think we we read that part last time
[23:48] because this ministry is at Beyond time
[23:52] ministry
[23:58] that's why he's outside
[24:03] not in the church
[24:06] I will compile this things for you
[24:12] where he repeated the same thing
[24:15] Christ has been kicked out
[24:21] and dance we will read the scripture
[24:24] daily
[24:27] [Music]
[24:28] okay
[24:30] let's go back to our
[24:33] scriptures yeah
[24:41] I think
[24:46] what do you call it now
[24:49] I think it is blowing too much heat oh
[24:52] yeah amen yes aircon
[24:55] yeah yeah
[25:04] trying to show winter that we really
[25:07] don't feel it yes
[25:11] otherwise we'll be banning ourselves to
[25:15] ashes
[25:16] right
[25:21] thank you
[25:24] brother we are going back to our
[25:26] scripture and you know that scripture
[25:30] we've been reading that scripture
[25:32] because that is the last scripture
[25:36] and after that we will look for
[25:40] another scripture
[25:44] let's reach our last scripture
[25:48] Revelation chapter 3 from verse 20 to
[25:51] 22. amen amen
[25:54] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[25:58] any man hear my voice and open the door

[26:04] him and he with me
[26:07] to him that overcometh will I grants to
[26:09] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[26:13] overcame and am sat down with my father
[26:16] in his room
[26:17] he that have an ear let him hear what
[26:20] the spirit says unto the churches amen
[26:23] I believe that
[26:26] we can
[26:28] go back to the first verse
[26:33] why the prophet says
[26:37] outside of the church
[26:41] in this location yeah
[26:46] those who worship Him are not in the
[26:49] church
[26:52] I mean I mean because it is the ministry
[26:56] is beyond time
[27:00] all right amen now John Maybe
[27:04] there's a reason the first
[27:09] for two verses and so forth they will
[27:12] tell you why the prophet says he is
[27:15] outside
[27:18] right amen from verse 14. and unto the
[27:22] angel of the Church of the audition
[27:23] right these things say the amen the
[27:26] faithful and true witness the beginning

[27:37] hot

[27:47] rich and increased with goods and have
[27:51] need of nothing and no it's not that

[31:54] amen amen
[31:58] the message is
[32:00] foreign
[32:09] [Music]
[32:12] because he doesn't knock at this body
[32:17] no or flesh and blood
[32:20] but he's looking
[32:23] another body
[32:25] amen amen
[32:28] because the message is
[32:42] um
[32:42] I I I looked at the book here of
[32:47] what do you call this Christ is the
[32:49] mystery of God revealed
[32:52] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[32:55] now if then he is outside of the
[33:00] change
[33:03] and the book says we we we we will
[33:07] gather unto him
[33:13] meaning unto him outside
[33:22] that's why I will repeat something here
[33:28] I I was with a brother
[33:31] in Zimbabwe
[33:34] we were driving somewhere he was driving
[33:37] me somewhere
[33:39] now I asked him a question he said where
[33:43] is brother so
[33:45] foreign
[34:18] [Music]
[34:30] [Music]
[34:35] what do you say about the five-fold
[34:38] ministry
[34:41] and the brother
[34:43] knowing when Eastern points
[34:51] all right amen I don't know if you know
[34:54] about the faithful ministers
[35:00] did you know that an evangelist
[35:03] is somebody who goes outside
[35:11] he is the pastor of the ship
[35:14] [Music]
[35:18] foreign
[35:27] but if you find one is an evangelist
[35:33] he has to go out today
[35:41] I think we've got to uh we are blessed
[35:45] even with the church
[35:47] [Music]
[35:53] sometimes we are dealing with the people
[35:58] who even don't know about the church
[36:02] they don't read the church order they
[36:06] they have some positions in the church
[36:11] without the church order
[36:24] amen amen and I think you and the elders
[36:31] he took a time putting together
[36:35] quotations
[36:39] it was when I looked at it it was a
[36:43] wonderful way
[36:47] I had to put that together
[36:50] and if
[36:53] we starting from us the elders
[36:57] if we were able to read and look at the
[37:01] church
[37:04] I will know what to do
[37:08] amen amen but if
[37:13] you use the church order
[37:16] then we do things just the way we think
[37:19] amen amen
[37:23] [Music]
[37:25] now amen I think if only the only thing
[37:31] is that
[37:33] when we are preaching here we are
[37:36] preaching just to a small
[37:38] group
[37:43] not the other churches
[37:47] our our wedding here is going to the
[37:52] heart not to the church
[37:57] that's why some
[38:01] as they are talking about that
[38:05] five-fold minutes
[38:07] but they don't know what is
[38:12] okay all right we've got them yeah
[38:17] daddy prepared them for us
[38:22] we also don't make use of them
[38:27] we will go
[38:30] the other way
[38:32] okay let us go back to the church order
[38:35] yeah
[38:39] if each and every one of us
[38:44] you can get a copy of electricity and
[38:49] look at the church order I then
[38:51] amen all right
[38:56] order things go the other way
[39:01] all right God bless you
[39:07] Works in marriage
[39:12] now that's why a brother was asked a
[39:15] question
[39:16] [Music]
[39:24] then I realized that the brother don't
[39:27] read his church
[39:33] we are not all pastors
[39:39] we are not all evangelists
[39:43] amen amen so each and everyone
[39:48] whether it's an animal or a man
[39:54] he is strong in his position
[39:59] [Music]
[40:00] [Applause]
[40:01] do you know that once you shift from
[40:04] position
[40:06] then you become so weak
[40:09] and the devil can attack you attack yeah
[40:13] you all right amen now we should remain
[40:17] in our place
[40:19] even before we start off
[40:22] check for your position
[40:27] before we start off
[40:29] all right amen we have like we have
[40:34] young people here
[40:38] many of them don't read this book
[40:42] they don't bother themselves
[40:52] and then if you don't read these things
[41:06] Christian
[41:11] it's somebody who is Christ's life
[41:15] he reads his Bible
[41:17] he reads the way
[41:20] he prays every time
[41:23] and he doesn't commit sin he really had
[41:26] to receive it because sin is unbelief
[41:30] and believe is sin
[41:34] is that right amen now we have such
[41:37] people
[41:39] in the churches
[41:41] who actually are not Christians
[41:49] they know themselves
[41:54] I
[41:57] can do anything
[42:01] all right now let's look at this one
[42:05] with this everybody
[42:24] amen amen as he spoke to the last church
[42:29] [Music]
[42:30] I mean at the end of it all yeah
[42:36] um he now spoke to those
[42:41] as he says behold I stand at the door
[42:48] I'm out of the church
[42:53] now I'm just at the door
[42:57] yeah
[42:59] if any not any church
[43:03] but if any
[43:05] amen
[43:07] opens yeah
[43:11] so he's saying nothing about the chase
[43:16] he's talking about the individuals
[43:22] yeah Christ is the mystery of God
[43:25] revealed Christ is the mystery of God
[43:27] revealed
[43:30] it takes all about the individuals
[43:33] [Music]
[43:52] and we were
[43:58] close amen amen the service amen amen
[44:04] [Music]
[44:05] um
[44:07] and
[44:14] to the people
[44:18] because preaching
[44:21] is for those
[44:23] that are
[44:25] Beyond Time
[44:30] okay amen
[44:33] let me open the books now
[44:37] at what now let's look at this

[1:36:16] so
[1:36:29] the bride should know about the
[1:36:32] Millennium
[1:36:34] what's happening there for now
[1:36:37] the bride should know about this
[1:36:42] of the Book of Revelation Church
[1:37:01] [Applause]
[1:37:04] you know
[1:37:06] all this
[1:37:09] there were some
[1:37:11] codes and so forth
[1:37:14] I am
[1:37:15] I won't get much into that
[1:37:20] when they think that was my brother him
[1:37:26] we were talking about those quotes
[1:37:29] and I I said
[1:37:33] uh
[1:37:35] I wonder because he believed to me
[1:37:40] yeah I said you know because the bride
[1:37:43] yeah
[1:37:45] will be judging with the bright groups
[1:37:53] already
[1:37:56] goddess now
[1:38:00] the bride has to send the bride
[1:38:04] the documents

[1:38:15] like this
[1:38:19] the bride of Christ they are only sent
[1:38:22] to the bride of Christ
[1:38:25] because
[1:38:26] the bridegroom once
[1:38:30] the bride to know
[1:38:34] since the bride is going to judge
[1:38:36] together with the bridegroom
[1:38:41] I I will read to you those things the
[1:38:45] king and the queen
[1:38:48] I've got it down
[1:38:51] yes
[1:38:53] you see the king and
[1:39:00] you know I've got to hear something
[1:39:04] where he says
[1:39:07] he's no longer a mediator
[1:39:13] but then I need to read it to you out of
[1:39:16] the spoken words
[1:39:20] that he is
[1:39:32] I'm going
[1:39:35] Horizon
[1:39:38] you know the thing
[1:39:42] you just come to the end
[1:39:45] now all these things
[1:39:49] they are only sent to the bride I mean
[1:39:54] foreign
[1:40:18] oh
[1:40:19] yeah my friend it's like that way shy
[1:40:22] because she's going to matter
[1:40:28] it's just it's just says

[1:41:12] have you had another woman
[1:41:24] is she can try
[1:41:26] talk about it she's going to mess
[1:41:31] it is exactly
[1:41:33] she will not bring the exact coconut
[1:41:36] even now I'm saying
[1:41:38] against man who is who against I don't
[1:41:43] believe any woman can answer that
[1:41:50] that's why Christians
[1:41:52] Christ said but worrying what do the
[1:41:56] people say when they are talking about
[1:41:59] me amen they said some say this some say
[1:42:03] this
[1:42:06] and he said

[1:42:16] it goes like that
[1:42:19] some people say but by
[1:42:22] you are Jeremiah you are this you are
[1:42:27] not revealed but
[1:42:33] what do you say

[1:42:59] talking I was talking even with another
[1:43:00] brother

[1:44:35] you will not know it
[1:44:37] if you you were to say
