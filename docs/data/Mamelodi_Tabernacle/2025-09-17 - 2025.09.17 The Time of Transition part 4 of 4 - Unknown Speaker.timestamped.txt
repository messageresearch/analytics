[0:03] [Music]
[0:32] What?
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Most interesting.
[0:38] That's why
[0:39] &gt;&gt; a notable thing because
[0:42] rest of them just seem ordinary.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Now the problem
[0:51] &gt;&gt; is
[0:53] [Music]
[0:57] [Applause]
[1:00] people are being confused by
[1:06] &gt;&gt; now if God something out there
[1:10] &gt;&gt; to go to another dimension.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; And it comes
[1:15] &gt;&gt; he gives it wings.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; To to take a flight.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Now, brother says, "And that angel came
[1:24] and
[1:26] hallelujah.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; Now among the seven angels, he was
[1:29] looking at the one."
[1:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "That one is is the one with
[1:34] the seven."
[1:36] Hallelujah.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; Now can you explain brother standing
[1:42] like this
[1:43] &gt;&gt; and talking about an angel with the
[1:46] seven s
[1:50] &gt;&gt; and you say wings wings. Yes wings but
[1:54] the prophet says
[1:55] &gt;&gt; the angels in heaven don't know about
[1:57] it.
[2:03] [Applause]
[2:08] Can we interpret who is this seven?
[2:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; Because
[2:14] &gt;&gt; the the angels don't know.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; He says they were out by it. What is
[2:21] that?
[2:21] &gt;&gt; But this they know.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; Who are they?
[2:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28] [Music]
[2:31] If I can see my
[2:34] [Music]
[2:36] [Applause]
[2:38] &gt;&gt; sometimes I'm talking about myself.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; It doesn't apply somewhere else but I'm
[2:46] I'm trying to say something.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; If I can look at something coming flying
[2:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; and
[2:53] &gt;&gt; and it's notable to me.
[2:56] So I won't worry about the news.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; No,
[3:00] &gt;&gt; because
[3:01] &gt;&gt; when it comes
[3:07] &gt;&gt; here
[3:08] &gt;&gt; the Bible says the woman was given wings
[3:13] &gt;&gt; to fly into the wilderness.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; Did you see Israel flying?
[3:19] &gt;&gt; No.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; That woman was Israel. Yeah.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible says she was given wings.
[3:28] [Music]
[3:29] &gt;&gt; And again, I'm told that the old and the
[3:32] new testament to
[3:36] &gt;&gt; you have church ages and
[3:40] amen.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; Now for the rapture, you don't need the
[3:44] old testament.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; No. And when you come,
[3:49] you must find the the new which is the
[3:52] seven changes and the six.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; Give you the capacity.
[3:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; To fly out.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Otherwise you have your wings by the
[4:10] turbulence
[4:13] &gt;&gt; and crash.
[4:18] There were people who would say,
[4:19] "Brother Ben is my man. He's my
[4:22] prophet." And the next thing they say is
[4:24] a false prophet.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; We call it an air crash.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody comes to say, "I'm above
[4:37] brother."
[4:43] Amen.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:46] Now we look for the black box. What caus
[4:48] this?
[4:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:56] [Applause]
[4:58] [Music]
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Lucifer crashed
[5:05] &gt;&gt; and the black box tell the story that he
[5:08] wanted to build up.
[5:12] Exactly.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Because the first thing when there is a
[5:16] crash
[5:18] exactly
[5:20] &gt;&gt; was found
[5:22] what caused the accident. Lucifer wanted
[5:25] to build
[5:28] &gt;&gt; that.
[5:31] [Music]
[5:34] &gt;&gt; He fell so hot.
[5:38] Yes,
[5:39] &gt;&gt; saw him when he hit the dish there.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; What happened?
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; He couldn't answer because he was
[5:53] listening.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:06] Yeah.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brennan had to connect with
[6:15] the angel in order to
[6:17] &gt;&gt; inter.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; Now, if he interprets that,
[6:21] &gt;&gt; yes,
[6:23] &gt;&gt; how can an ordinary person
[6:29] &gt;&gt; hear it? Hey,
[6:32] &gt;&gt; unless it's from his
[6:34] &gt;&gt; your Exactly.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; Because it's good time.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Can you believe that? For for for for us
[6:45] to see these things, we have to pick
[6:48] them from our
[6:55] if it is eternity.
[6:59] This body is time.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Bren says the Lord
[7:06] had to come and sprinkle his blood
[7:08] there.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; To redeem.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; That place.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; And that's why now he
[7:19] the purpose being that he should bring
[7:22] the men back there.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; So that he can the network can
[7:33] &gt;&gt; that's why then when brother was there
[7:35] now
[7:36] &gt;&gt; standing in the gap.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; For what brother?
[7:42] &gt;&gt; Let me ask brother why standing in the
[7:46] gap.
[7:47] Because now that gap if God redeemed
[7:50] something
[7:52] &gt;&gt; that means he brings it back to where it
[7:56] was. No
[7:57] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't I don't have
[8:01] &gt;&gt; I don't have standing in the gap book
[8:03] here but it says
[8:04] &gt;&gt; amen
[8:07] I the angel lifted me up.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; Now, some people think that brother was
[8:14] picked up with jackets flying in the air
[8:17] by an angel falling and so
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Now, it's not a myth.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; No,
[8:26] &gt;&gt; the angel picked you up.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; But for the angel to pick you up,
[8:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; is like in the rapture.
[8:38] [Music]
[8:40] The angel picked him up. Now it is not
[8:43] like people were looking at brother and
[8:46] suddenly they saw him flying in the air.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; West
[8:52] then he would be a UFO.
[8:56] [Music]
[8:59] &gt;&gt; When he met with the angel he came back
[9:02] listen to do what?
[9:04] to reveal. Now, time won't allow me, but
[9:07] page 11 tells you that he tore off the
[9:10] seal and sent it down to the seventh
[9:12] angel for him to reveal the church.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Now, the people are looking for it up
[9:22] there. That's why they miss it
[9:25] &gt;&gt; because it was brought down
[9:27] &gt;&gt; to a man but the man blinds them because
[9:30] it says the lamp.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; As we say when when Moses came to Egypt
[9:40] the Bible the word said Jehovah shall
[9:43] deliver them.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; But then who came?
[9:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[9:48] [Music]
[9:51] &gt;&gt; It's difficult if Jehovah says something
[9:54] and somebody comes like Moses and says
[9:57] I'm sent from the I am
[10:01] &gt;&gt; follow
[10:06] it was very difficult for Abraham
[10:10] &gt;&gt; to be able to say to somebody you see
[10:13] the man eating Hey
[10:17] eating chicken there.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; It was very difficult.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; Now, brother says he saw him when he
[10:28] stepped in.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; He saw the halo of light.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Three halos of light. Now when he says
[10:39] when he stepped into human
[10:42] &gt;&gt; then he said then he knew that it
[10:47] &gt;&gt; is a man
[10:48] [Applause]
[10:54] &gt;&gt; bring one
[10:56] [Music]
[10:57] &gt;&gt; with dusty feet
[11:02] &gt;&gt; with dusty feet
[11:04] &gt;&gt; under a
[11:05] [Applause]
[11:09] Hallelujah.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; Now Elohim
[11:21] &gt;&gt; came
[11:23] into brotherham
[11:26] [Music]
[11:30] &gt;&gt; and opened these things to us.
[11:37] Jehovah
[11:38] &gt;&gt; came into Moses
[11:41] &gt;&gt; and deliver them.
[11:45] [Applause]
[11:50] as it was. Yes.
[11:52] [Music]
[11:55] [Applause]
[12:11] &gt;&gt; As Elohim,
[12:14] &gt;&gt; the selfexistent one
[12:16] &gt;&gt; came like a fly
[12:19] &gt;&gt; into a red
[12:21] [Applause]
[12:23] He created himself in body and
[12:28] [Applause]
[12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[12:36] [Music]
[12:37] [Applause]
[12:40] &gt;&gt; So simple.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; So simple.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; We search for the eating under a tree
[12:49] there. Yes.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; We sat under a tribute. Brother
[12:57] &gt;&gt; is a man like me.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; But God the reason why it was silent.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; It is because the network
[13:09] &gt;&gt; was from God to a
[13:15] &gt;&gt; which is the heart.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The mighty God. Amen.
[13:21] Then it came to brother.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; That's why revelation 10. That's why
[13:25] where he came through the god of honor
[13:28] with the book and he couldn't interpret
[13:31] that. He couldn't reveal that book
[13:34] because it belonged to mankind.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; But he as there was no man with
[13:42] &gt;&gt; he opened a book took the books from
[13:45] within himself.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; That is the mysteries. put them into
[13:49] brother
[13:54] &gt;&gt; I can put my
[13:56] head on
[14:01] &gt;&gt; he took it and put in Moses and Moses
[14:04] came and said my people
[14:11] &gt;&gt; he came and put it in Elijah and Elisha
[14:15] said I want your spirit
[14:19] Hallelujah.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; That is amen.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; So the seals were put in. Amen.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; In order to be received by me.
[14:28] [Applause]
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Now the seventh seal.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; The reason the reason they say
[14:39] okay I'm picking now.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Remember I'm a pecking creature now.
[14:47] Ready to go.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. Ready to go.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Now, the reason that there's a reason
[14:59] let's look at it.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; All right.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Well,
[15:04] the reason is that the servants, he said
[15:07] nothing.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; In heaven.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; And then there was a man standing on
[15:13] earth.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; The message was sent down to
[15:21] &gt;&gt; the seven
[15:22] &gt;&gt; men.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; That's why they don't

[15:30] something here quickly. You listen to
[15:31] it. The world the people they do read

[16:25] somewhere else.

[27:16] secret of it. The prophet
[27:20] says they discovered it
[27:23] &gt;&gt; and they open.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Brother discovered the seven churches.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; He said I discovered seven things in the
[27:32] Bible.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Then he found them and he preached
[27:36] &gt;&gt; now they discovered the six. He says
[27:40] they discovered the seal
[27:42] &gt;&gt; and they are going now to open it to the
[27:45] Jews
[27:46] &gt;&gt; and to introduce them to the Messiah.

[27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; So finally that's why
[27:59] &gt;&gt; yes
[28:00] &gt;&gt; the Lord left the intercessory box.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody will put up
[28:11] Children of God.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; I mean
[28:15] when he took the book
[28:17] &gt;&gt; he left the inter
[28:22] &gt;&gt; because the blood applies
[28:25] &gt;&gt; up to the seventh church.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Now brother saying but we are baptizing
[28:32] the people. I said yes.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; He took the book to train.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; When the seals were open
[28:45] in that year,
[28:46] &gt;&gt; you were in the in
[28:52] [Music]
[28:53] &gt;&gt; that that has got nothing to do with
[28:55] your predestination.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he came with the book to claim
[29:02] you.
[29:03] [Music]
[29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; He's been claiming
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[29:14] [Music]
[29:18] [Applause]
[29:22] It's not a church individ
[29:25] [Applause]
[29:34] and brother says he's after he was
[29:36] kicked out of the church
[29:39] &gt;&gt; then as he was kicked out because a
[29:41] church is a group of people. Yeah,
[29:45] a pastor can stand up and say the seven
[29:48] is not revealed and the children will
[29:50] say
[29:53] &gt;&gt; you see now he's a church.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; But then after he is kicked out then he
[29:59] comes and knocks at the individual.
[30:04] [Applause]
[30:08] &gt;&gt; We don't want him in the church anymore.
[30:11] Amen.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Now listen, let's close with this.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Christ is now is now not welcome
[30:19] &gt;&gt; in the churches.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; In the churches, they've got their laws,
[30:28] their rules.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Now he comes and knock.
[30:33] Amen.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; He says if
[30:37] &gt;&gt; a man not a church
[30:40] &gt;&gt; a man hears my voice.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Before you open you hear first
[30:46] &gt;&gt; a voice.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; The voice of the seven.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; If a man hears my voice and open the
[30:55] door.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; Open the door.
[30:59] He says then I will come in
[31:07] &gt;&gt; so he opened
[31:08] &gt;&gt; yes
[31:10] &gt;&gt; who's there
[31:11] &gt;&gt; the third pool the seven
[31:14] [Applause]
[31:19] &gt;&gt; and somebody will close the door
[31:22] [Music]
[31:25] said nothing
[31:28] Amen.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; But if you open, he doesn't come and
[31:34] chat with you. He comes in
[31:38] &gt;&gt; and s
[31:41] is the evening.
[31:44] [Music]
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; So the reason he left the sanctuary
[31:52] &gt;&gt; which we can read here that when he took
[31:54] the book, he left the the intercessory.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; And after that he gave to the
[32:07] &gt;&gt; to his seventh angel to reveal to the
[32:10] people.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Then he took away the
[32:13] &gt;&gt; forerunner.
[32:17] Amen.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the forerunner before he left
[32:21] he said the unveiling of God
[32:26] [Music]
[32:31] &gt;&gt; because the the the mediator is being a
[32:35] vain
[32:37] between us and God
[32:40] couldn't see through.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; We see the messenger. We see the
[32:45] mediator. We can't see through. Oh,
[32:48] amen.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; The spirits are in the mediator
[32:54] &gt;&gt; for the men to come back.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; And connect with the angel
[33:12] &gt;&gt; after you connected.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Something that I've never
[33:18] it from anywhere
[33:20] &gt;&gt; where is it
[33:22] &gt;&gt; after he connected because this is seven
[33:24] angels
[33:25] &gt;&gt; coming but there's one in
[33:29] &gt;&gt; you know now now listen what he says
[33:31] here
[33:32] &gt;&gt; amen
[33:34] &gt;&gt; now he he had to leave the box because
[33:38] he's a shield
[33:42] &gt;&gt; then took away the prophet because
[33:45] &gt;&gt; before is also a
[33:48] Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; The first veil turn off
[33:54] &gt;&gt; and the second
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of these veins he had to
[34:06] open
[34:08] &gt;&gt; so that we can see
[34:11] [Music]
[34:16] &gt;&gt; that's why now today I'm not saying
[34:18] brother who says the seven is this I'm
[34:22] saying it is this
[34:25] [Applause]
[34:27] [Music]
[34:30] &gt;&gt; now now listen what he says
[34:34] The angel was veryable to me. The rest
[34:36] of them just seem ordinary. But this
[34:38] angel was a noted angel was to my left
[34:41] in the constellation in a form of a
[34:44] pyramid. And you remember it was in the
[34:47] pyramid where the mysterious white rock
[34:50] was not written.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; And the angels took me into the pyramid
[34:55] of themselves.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Now this is the pyramid of the angels.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Not of boulders. No,
[35:06] &gt;&gt; but of the angels to put them in and
[35:09] because brother stood there as the right
[35:11] hand man.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Because the book was in the right.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Came down
[35:18] to brother.
[35:24] Hallelujah.

[35:40] hand
[35:43] [Applause]
[35:48] [Music]
[35:53] and come to the right hand
[35:54] [Applause]
[35:58] Amen.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; People can leave their revelations and
[36:01] come to the right hand.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; So he says now

[36:09] in and the angels took me into the
[36:11] pyramid of
[36:13] &gt;&gt; and you know when the angels left

[36:18] mysterious cloud. It was the face of the
[36:23] Yes.
[36:25] [Music]
[36:34] &gt;&gt; And says they left where I was staying.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; So he was represented among the angels
[36:45] &gt;&gt; and they left where he was staying
[36:49] &gt;&gt; and now as it went out up it was the
[36:51] head of the Lord Jesus.
[36:54] Hallelujah.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; The church is captive.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; And now the branch has received.
