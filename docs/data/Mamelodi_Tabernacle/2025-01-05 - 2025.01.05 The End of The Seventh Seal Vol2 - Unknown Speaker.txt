up front give us a [Applause] [Music] testimony uh uh I'd like to greet you all in the precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ sorry about my voice I had some flu uh yeah I testify years back when I was still young now brother is always on my back about that he said they they did recorded [Music] it I think is brother that did that I don't know what happened to that video you ask him amen okay while the pastor is still coming I can just roughly give you my [Applause] testimony it is through always okay amen okay uh my testimony is in this fashion uh I I was around 29 years of age by then I am now 77 years7 amen by then I was not a Believer I was here in M was working that was in [Music] 1977 1977 so it happened that uh you know was just I didn't I didn't believe in God I didn't have a Bible I didn't care whether God was there or not or hell was there or not mine was just leg uh yes I was a sinner drinking smoking and then one day I got sick from work and then in those days we were using trains I was working at Queen [Music] Queenswood so I all lighted here at watl I went to see a doctor that doctor was my friend also so he said to me I need to give you two shorts of penicilin I don't want to take the pastor's time penicillin is an [Music] antibiotic which was allergic to my blood so yes he gave me those penisin two of them I think it was around 5 or 5 I was from work was to work for Simons right so after those shorts then I saw Blackness and then I saw darkness and then I could see that now I I'm dying even if I Can't Describe [Music] death but that was death so I struggled I didn't even know that I have a soul or or a spirit during those days and then said now if this is death [Music] then let it come great people died Kings died so if he dead let it [Music] come but uh I didn't know what will come after that de when it did [Music] come my soul went out of my body I could see my body lying there and the doctor and the nurse were were busy with my body I was in another body then I went to them to try and tell them that here am I amen but when I want to touch the doctor my hand went through and then they were discussing about me I could hear what they were [Music] saying but they could not see me by then I didn't know about Dimensions so the doctor said okay he is [Music] dead they packed my body and the doctor said to the nurse call uh the ambulance from the muary to come and take this body and phone the police to go and tell the the parents at home that he's dead right but could hear them so I was just roing around then all of a sudden something just touched me then the scene changed I was in the bottomless pit which is very dark in which you fall without hitting the ground there were so many people in there screaming nobody cares about who's next to him and there's a torment there now the torment of this Bo and the torment of the soul is not the same you see this body I can take a soul and so it's very painful but the torment of the Soul you cannot describe it the only description is that you go and and taste it you go and taste it that is why I will never leave the weight because I know what the bottomless pit is and I know what the torment is this people who are playing about playing around it's because they don't know [Music] okay you must make my [Music] way so I was crying for falling [Music] crying tormented never hits the ground so the torment is you are about to wake up but you can't wake up we are about to hit the ground but you can't hit the ground there's an unexplainable pain so I was saying but what have I done and then the voice said do you know where you are he said no I don't know where and when that voice speaks the tment stops so the voice said that is the bottom of spe that is the punishment you are getting you're still going to be judged I said but I haven't done anything he said no you rejected the word of the [Music] Lord said I never rejected the word of the Lord nobody has ever come to me about the and scene [Music] changed it was here in M those that knows M the section c C3 that's where I grew up I attended school year in M high school so after myri then I was at home sitting in the olden days we used to be very clean people our shoes were always shining so I was boning my shoes and then it was during the the 1976 riots and that's in the morning around [Music] 910 so a mercedesbenz just stopped there young man a [Music] white wearing a black suit came and knock I said come in then he said you spoke in Africans and [Music] said so I said you came to young man may maybe next [Music] door we are fighting the boers that was 1976 and it's Sunday today I'm relaxing I'm boning my shoes I'm listening to my music tomorrow I'll be saving your brother who's oppressing me and then your God sent you to me go to so he took out the pen and write a note and gave it to me I put it in a [Music] blumb yeah then he went off next week Sunday he came again it was the same [Music] thing the following Sunday until I organize my friends I'll buy them beers let's let's attend to this man so I bought lot of beers said and waited for him he came and when he came they all stood up and left and left me [Music] alone so he gave me the note again so I told my siblings that when that young man comes tell him that I'm not in so he came I hide it in in the in the bedroom it was a for house when he came and asked they open up a curtain we didn't do until I said no you go away and I started running away from him when I was in the bottomless spe what came out we have sent an angel you the word of God so I said yeah but it was a wrong time we were fighting so you can't send a Bo while we fighting boers you would have sent somebody else okay there's quite a lot of things they showed me friends at school were trying to testify to me I rejected all those things so after that back to the bom back to the shouting and crying [Music] together until by his grace I just woke up and then the doctor was surprised said I certify you date by then I was taking out the cigarette and and throwing out everything I didn't know how to [Applause] repent so I went back [Music] home I

touch them and his disciples rebuke those that brought them but when when he but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and bless them amen amen okay God bless okay let's bad our heavenly father wonderful God we are here you are here this morning amen that's why we are here because you are here thank you Lord

father that's according to your plan amen as I I pray for the child dedicate this child for the glory of God in Jesus Christ's name amen [Applause] amen God bless you mama and papa amen am okay keep l in Christ [Applause] I I I I believe that before the proceedings um this morning we were calling to have our brother gabri Gabriel Brother Gabriel but G Gabriel amen see amen yeah and God bless [Applause] you the Willing uh we believe we will still meet before our take amen we are going amen soon and very soon we are going to see the king soon and very soon we are going to see the king soon and very soon we are going to see h hallelu Hallelujah we are going to see the brother says he is now a king why because the Seed of Abraham is now on the move they are going we will look at that subject amen amen amen the home goinging of the sons of God the SE of ab when we will try to give [Music] you when when okay amen you may be seated s but I think I won't feel good uh if I don't ask my eternal brother just to say shalom goodbye [Applause] my brother just to say good morning and I'm leaving but still you'll see me here God bless you sir you know they say that you cannot be two places at the same time but I don't know if I can agree with that entirely because my heart and soul is in Africa but I have to take but I have to take my body and I have to go back to the United States because that's where I live that's where I work and that's where my uh obligations in life are but when I leave and go there my heart and soul is with you here we are a long ways apart in distance but we are not a long ways apart in heart amen I think I thank the Lord that he has made a way for our paths to cross and uh I know I know that it's God that has done this and I will always be grateful for that so I just appreciate the time I have been able to spend I I so grateful that I could be in the conference with you all as well there's just one brief thing I was going to share because it stood out to me let me see if I can get my folder when I was in the meeting for the conference the last morning I was sitting in the dining area at the and as I was sitting there I was thinking you know I really love my brothers and sisters here in this country they're dear to my heart and I thought you know I said I put them here and I and I put myself down here I said but when I get around them they put me here and themselves down here so as I was thinking about this there was a certain scripture that came to my mind and I wanted to share that that scripture is in Philippians chapter 2 and it's verse three verse so I'm going to read that let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in liness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves I think if everybody had that kind of an attitude we wouldn't have near the kind of problems I know you understand what it means to close amen amen to keep it closed in you as the time when allow me now while standing after this we are just going to read to say a prayer and dismiss the [Music] church that we we were supposed to preach we still going to preach but I just want to read this part I think there at the conference we have read the same thing the revelation of what that was amen I can't say sit because I just read for to pray the revelation of what that was I wonder if you understood that [Music] there nothing new with us what we have is the revelation of what that wasen and it is here today because it was not a revelation there now because today we are here in our bodies now it's a revelation to us of what that was I just read to you everything that we are receiving everything that we hear here is the revelation of what that was because I was I'm not I'm not preaching that's why I don't want us to sit down let me read you something here I I I won't preach you know today the prophet says the bride H is Alpha and Oma do you believe that now Al and Omega amen amen and then he he continues to [Music] say she came through the process yes of this denominations which only comes through uh which only comes in existence B yeah which which only only comes in existence once right but the bride returns back again in the last days amen okay amen there are things that came once and I look for them today I don't see [Music] them but I see the bride of Christ she came for the second amen I always tell my brothers maybe be seated for five six minutes I said since ever I have never seen children of God like this ch children of God I see what makes me to say so it is because we met we have met before and we are here to manifest who we are who we [Music] were say it I'm just saying this in order for to to close the service no listen to my prophet brother William Brother William Bram we are going to meet a sister sister my my sister once had a dream then she came to me and said brother I had a dream H it was like I was going through entering a certain place but at the gate I met brother and she says then brother bam said you go back she says I dreamed that I was dead that was the dream but I met brother Bram at the gate when I was about to enter the then he said go tell brother to keep on going [Applause] [Applause] you know our language is not just a language it goes deep because it is from then I said God bless you Sister I will live a clean life and serve God until I meet [Applause] brother oh okay amen and I am going that way I am told that you won't see another year I don't want to say I predict anything I'm not trying to predict anything what I know is that the rupture [Applause] amen I even tell small children that the Rapture small children I tell them that the Rapture is here uh I was told about the [Music] neing do you know do you know about where is that brother who's that brother fear not to stand up do you know about the neph me and you we were watching one is it so yes they appeared before and they reappeared today because is the time of the rapt okay we'll talk amen because I'm not preaching and it says the church came once brother uh can you find uh I see only the out the this book what is the title I want the title here the title here it's master Master peace you are right brother amen let me just read and we close the service we'll come back to continue uh with the word of God you know even last time H I don't know we were reading something there but we are coming to read it says I wondered about the when I look at the seals there's something here what God did about the world he worked I I think last time I read the same thing it was in his mind if you notice it come like Revolution like he was learning all the time making something greater greater he was above it all and just let it evolute up to that you see and everything he began to bring upon the Earth from B life you still remember the and fish and so forth and uh beds animals and then something in his own image forgive me for wiping and wiping like uh a man and stopped there why because it was up to his Perfection you remember he said let us make men in our now today if he comes doing his rounds and he arve at a man who is like him stop amen that's why Revelation tell s say you can find it Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished as he ha declared to his servants the prophets right amen now the last one did I say Revelation yes okay now find this scripture for me I know the scripture where it says but I I want that part brother when he open he stopped okay then there's a scripture again Revelation 81 where he [Music] stopped and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour all right yes okay amen now before we we we we we closed uh after this did did God stop somewhere else yes in Genesis yeah in Genesis he stopped I am after when he made man after he made men yes but not just a man is is men in his meaning God stopped at his image amen there somewhere elsewhere he stopped the scripture the scripture didn't continue the scripture he didn't continue you find those places in the Bible amen the seventh he stopped why he stopped course image Something In His Image brother Bram puts it to me then he stopped am amen here's the scripture say sister here's the scripture where again he never said anything further and where he opened the SC and he found a place closed it when he he found a place yes and then he says this day the scripture is fulfilled before and closed and stopped all right amen now every time he comes to seven now there's another scripture he came to seven and he didn't go further say it sister don't fear Genesis Genesis 2:2 okay and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made what happened after where uh where the Bible says let us make men in our image and after that Genesis 1 ver 26 then yes and God said let us make men in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created men in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them okay we'll come and look for for some because in his rounds the Bible when he arrived at the seven stops because he made man in his own image every time when he AR at his amen that's why the people don't see the revelation of the seven where do you read that Revelation 8 ver1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour meaning he stopped for [Music] about why because every time he arrives at his Ownage he stops now the last thing I I will I will close these books amen man is his and stopped why why he doesn't go further because he has made men in his amen that's why today we are preaching the message let me read you the last um the church only came into view once each Nation the church but the bread in twice see what it was not knowing it but look at it with my message this morning the seed fell in the ground at that was original seat and she come through the process of these denominations uh which only com in existence [Music] once well we are starting another something that we are going to continue amen amen you see if you look around you look around nothing is moving the church is just the church no life at all amen amen but now but when he speaks of the Bride he brings the the bride back again the bride is rolling on but the bride returns back again in the last days so that's why we are not new people we have come again in the last days because the Lord said I will restore H I'm going to read something to the people who would agree because the only person who can agree with you is the p a person who came from the same place with you otherwise they won't agree with you now that brother whom the people rejected when he was visiting here agreed with me and agree I agree with amen amen because I've got things here I've got things but we we can't read this to you but the the bride returns back again in the last days you know the bright you see now amen amen it's one Bri in the last days the restoration amen amen it's not a new baby bread no she was there and now she is here the Masterpiece Master is brought up that's the reason she was in view red the second time Bri you are not new reviewed that's why do you remember the title last week what was it end of the seventh seene was it the title yes and there's a Ministry Beyond Time a Ministry Beyond Beyond Time amen that's right amen that's the real now let me finish it she was reviewed the first time then she was reved the second amen am and she's perfectly the second time like she was it's not a new she no she was for the first time she is today just the same as she was for the first time that is the bride just a church amen that's why amen some we will read because it says God have mercy all others never appeared no more they never appear right you have things things you have seen things that started but you don't see it they went out never to come back again as the others but the bride came back because she is Alpha and Omega if the husband is Alpha and wife is God the great SC has made him a masterpiece for it is a piece of his first Master amen amen glad we are coming to follow this thing last let me just read this we stand up and close the this part but we will continue look that is Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ is the Myster of God revealed page 33 paragraph 233 Christ in you the
