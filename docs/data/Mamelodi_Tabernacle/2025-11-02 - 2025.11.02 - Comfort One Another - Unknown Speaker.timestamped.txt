[1:04:59] But before greetings, let's go through
[1:05:01] our upcoming events.
[1:05:05] We have a wedding on the 22nd of
[1:05:07] November.
[1:05:12] The wedding of brother Divine
[1:05:14] Divine and sister.
[1:05:18] [music]

[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Regarding our December convention,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; uh the request was for the deposits
[1:05:43] to reach us by the end of October.
[1:05:45] [music]
[1:05:50] So I believe we have made those
[1:05:54] deposits.
[1:05:58] And may the Lord richly bless you.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Now every sister church
[1:06:06] they have a local coordinator
[1:06:11] like in Modi.
[1:06:14] We have brother
[1:06:17] and brother
[1:06:20] Hoyani. They are our local coordinators.
[1:06:26] So all the believers will lies with them
[1:06:32] and brother
[1:06:35] and brother
[1:06:38] will then lies
[1:06:41] with brother Mutan.
[1:06:45] So we cannot all be calling and sending
[1:06:49] the details to brother Mutan.
[1:06:55] So you need to know your local
[1:06:58] coordinator
[1:06:59] for your sister church.
[1:07:04] Then you give your details
[1:07:08] to the local coordinator.
[1:07:12] Hallelujah.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And we also try to avoid avoid cash
[1:07:17] payments.
[1:07:20] cash.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; So that's why we send out the banking
[1:07:23] details
[1:07:26] details.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; So after you deposited the money,
[1:07:31] you also share the deposit slip with the
[1:07:36] [music] local coordinator.
[1:07:41] Also keep the original.
[1:07:46] You can even take it a photo,
[1:07:49] send it to the local coordinator
[1:07:53] and make sure you keep the copy.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:33:28] will be a little bit difficult.
[1:33:34] We want mostly the family, maybe the
[1:33:36] visiting pastors to be here.
[1:33:43] The elders of the church
[1:33:46] will give us maybe space outside there
[1:33:52] and also a way for us to see whatever is
[1:33:54] happening inside here.
[1:33:57] So if you don't find space in here,
[1:34:02] Please don't blame anybody.
[1:34:05] Please. Uh it's a big event.
[1:34:09] We expecting quite a lot of people.
[1:34:12] But the pastor's wish.
[1:34:17] He himself said he didn't want to depart
[1:34:20] from some glittering place somewhere.

[1:34:27] duty here.
[1:34:33] Hallelujah. Amen.

[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; He should he should be escorted
[1:35:19] by people who loved him most when he was
[1:35:21] alive.
[1:35:31] [applause]
[1:35:37] Hallelujah.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; So the graveyard is at gas fontain
[1:35:45] uh during the suffering of the pastor.
[1:35:52] uh we limited the number of people
[1:35:58] to visit him
[1:36:01] because we want you to have the memory
[1:36:02] of him as he is.
[1:36:07] Amen. But this time around
[1:36:12] we want you
[1:36:14] every one of you give your respects as
[1:36:17] much as you can.
[1:36:20] There's no limitation on the people can
[1:36:22] come.
[1:36:24] We want just our elders to just make
[1:36:26] sure that everybody who want to come,
[1:36:28] let them come.
[1:36:32] But his wish
[1:36:34] is for those people who loved him when
[1:36:36] he was alive.
[1:36:43] [applause]
[1:36:45] Hallelujah.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can see how the pastor
[1:36:49] valued you so much.

[1:36:58] arrangements to have it in a bigger
[1:37:00] place like Heartfeld Arena
[1:37:07] but it wasn't in his wish.
[1:37:10] He want to depart from a point of duty.
[1:37:16] Amen.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; So that's what we are going to do
[1:37:22] uh for him.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Uh he's in a better place than we are.
[1:37:32] Hallelujah.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:39] It couldn't be worse.
[1:37:44] I don't think you can remember any day
[1:37:45] worse than today
[1:37:50] in this
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; because
[1:37:54] the one we loved most
[1:37:57] we have lost him.
[1:38:01] Hallelujah. Amen.

[1:38:22] Imagine what happened at the church.
[1:38:26] What type of prayers were said at the
[1:38:27] church?
[1:38:31] Amen. So we are going through the same
[1:38:34] cycle which the church before has gone
[1:38:36] through
[1:38:41] and they have never been found wanting.
[1:38:46] Amen. Amen.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; So let us mourn our pastor
[1:38:53] until we shall remember
[1:38:55] that we mourned him very well.
[1:39:00] Hallelujah. Amen. It's a prerogative of
[1:39:02] everybody
[1:39:05] to make sure that we honor our pastor in
[1:39:07] such a way.

[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; So, we can stand and read the word.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. You help me. Uh let's go to the
[1:44:18] first Thessalonians
[1:44:20] 4
[1:44:22] 13 up to the end.
[1:44:35] But I would not have you to be ignorant,
[1:44:37] brethren,
[1:44:39] concerning them which are asleep, that
[1:44:41] ye sorrow not, even as others which have
[1:44:44] no hope. For if we believe that Jesus
[1:44:48] died and rose again, even so them also
[1:44:51] which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
[1:44:54] him.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. For this we say unto you by the
[1:44:57] word of the Lord, that we which are
[1:44:59] alive and remain unto the coming of the
[1:45:02] Lord shall not prevent them which are
[1:45:04] asleep.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; For the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:45:07] heaven with a shout, with the voice of
[1:45:10] the archangel, and with the trump of
[1:45:12] God, and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:45:15] first. Then we which are alive and
[1:45:19] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:45:21] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[1:45:24] the air. And so shall we ever be with
[1:45:27] the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another
[1:45:30] with his words.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; You can be seated. We have already.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:37] So uh the words of today
[1:45:41] is to comfort one another
[1:45:44] saying my brothers,
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; my sisters,
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; we should be mourning
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; but with hope.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; With hope. Because for us, we don't die.
[1:46:06] To die is to be separated.
[1:46:10] If you are separated from God,
[1:46:13] even if you are walking, you are dead.
[1:46:19] But what our pastor is in
[1:46:24] is asleep.
[1:46:25] Because Jesus said to his disciples,
[1:46:29] "Let's go to our friend Lazarus,
[1:46:33] for he sleepeth."
[1:46:35] And the disciples without discerning.
[1:46:39] If he's sleeping, he will wake up
[1:46:41] better.
[1:46:43] Then he said to them, "No, it's not that
[1:46:45] type of sleep.
[1:46:47] Uh he's dead."
[1:46:50] Hallelujah.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:46:55] uh when we talk about uh sleep
[1:47:01] it is in those four stages
[1:47:04] and the fourth one is death
[1:47:07] is asleep. So our pastor is sleeping.
[1:47:12] He's resting. We could after working so
[1:47:15] hard.
[1:47:29] So those of us who are awake like today
[1:47:35] in case the day is today we are going to
[1:47:37] go
[1:47:40] because my brother my sister we should
[1:47:42] be prepared to go
[1:47:45] remember Jesus Christ comes to those who
[1:47:49] are waiting for him.
[1:47:54] Remember
[1:47:55] when Nathaniel
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; was at home when Philip came to tell him
[1:48:03] he told him we have found that one
[1:48:08] which one? The one which they had been
[1:48:10] discussing the whole of their lives.
[1:48:15] That's what they have found. They were
[1:48:18] in one s of the country.
[1:48:21] They were telling that saying that when
[1:48:24] Andrew Andrew
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; goes to find his brother Peter,
[1:48:29] he tells him we have found him.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; They were waiting for him. They were
[1:48:36] discussing about him.
[1:48:40] Amen.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Um
[1:48:45] we have had just elections in Malawi
[1:48:47] there.
[1:48:50] We have been promised a lot of things.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; If you think South Africa will be
[1:49:00] better,
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; forget about it.
[1:49:06] There's a better place,
[1:49:09] a much better place for us
[1:49:13] where our pastor has gone.
[1:49:18] That's a place to aim for
[1:49:29] is so dirty.
[1:49:34] Dead dirt in both spiritual physical.
[1:49:40] Amen.
[1:49:43] There's a land
[1:49:46] fair
[1:49:49] says they are houses
[1:49:53] of of crystal clearar gold
[1:49:57] there.
[1:50:03] There's a land
[1:50:06] went there.
[1:50:07] There's a land better than this
[1:50:12] because the problem with you South
[1:50:13] Africans
[1:50:15] you try to compare us you and Malawians.
[1:50:21] Do you know in a class where you can
[1:50:23] take all the D children put them
[1:50:25] together they will be number one day.
[1:50:32] Number one.
[1:50:34] So South Africa is number one among the
[1:50:36] Dallas.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; You say we are better off than Malawi.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; You are also poor.
[1:50:54] There's a land which is better
[1:50:59] and it's not South Africa.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; It's not the United States. United
[1:51:04] States.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; I can take you to places in United
[1:51:07] States
[1:51:10] United States
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; which m here will look like a town.
[1:51:16] There are more people sleeping in the
[1:51:18] streets in the United States than they
[1:51:19] are in South Africa.
[1:51:25] Yet you want to go to the United States
[1:51:29] United States.
[1:51:32] There's a land which is fair.
[1:51:38] Our pastor is there this morning.
[1:51:43] [applause]
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; You know the wars of this day when when
[1:51:50] people fight wars today
[1:51:54] the general goes to hide
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; generally.
[1:52:00] You know this is new
[1:52:03] because all the olden times
[1:52:07] the general was supposed to be in the
[1:52:08] front
[1:52:12] to tell you
[1:52:14] to tell you don't fear
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; my brother my sister pastor didn't fear
[1:52:24] death
[1:52:27] [applause]
[1:52:29] the people are here who saw him. I saw
[1:52:32] him. Never in a day did he fear to die.
[1:52:36] Not even a day.
[1:52:40] He'll just wake up one morning. He'll be
[1:52:42] singing as if he's already in heaven.
[1:52:48] I'm telling the truth. One day he will
[1:52:50] just wake up. He will just sing as if he
[1:52:53] has already crossed.
[1:53:02] We were in ICU,
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; machines attached to everywhere.
[1:53:08] Mama were there. We started singing
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; and he was reading the he was reading
[1:53:14] the song.
[1:53:18] [applause]
[1:53:22] So
[1:53:24] when a general is in battle,
[1:53:28] He goes up front
[1:53:30] to tell you, "Fear not,
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; fear not."
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't fear
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; because he has gone before us.
[1:53:48] [cheering]
[1:53:49] [applause]
[1:53:51] Hallelujah. Amen. So we should be
[1:53:53] encouraged
[1:53:56] that our pastor
[1:53:58] has gone through the process of life.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; He should be our example.
[1:54:07] All of us should say I would like to be
[1:54:10] like
[1:54:15] crossing over whilst you are singing the
[1:54:17] songs of glory.
[1:54:24] Ask the people who were with him on
[1:54:26] Monday
[1:54:28] when he just woke up.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; So when we are in this message,
[1:54:40] brother sister one by one
[1:54:44] we'll be crossing the portals.
[1:54:49] We shall not fear
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; because Paul when he came to the end.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; He said death where is your sting?
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Because these things
[1:55:06] which we have been promised
[1:55:09] are true.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; I always give an example.
[1:55:15] when my children were younger.
[1:55:18] So you tell them
[1:55:22] Peter Peter
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; your birthday today this year
[1:55:28] will be at such a park
[1:55:32] immediately after that
[1:55:34] he goes to start saying that
[1:55:38] tells all his friends you I'm inviting
[1:55:41] you I'm not inviting you I'm inviting
[1:55:44] you where my father is going to give me
[1:55:50] a birthday party.
[1:55:53] I am a man.
[1:55:55] I can faith. But God cannot fail on his
[1:56:00] promise.
[1:56:04] He has promised eternal life to us.
[1:56:08] That means there is eternal life.
[1:56:14] And my brother, my sister, maybe even
[1:56:17] before you came into the message,
[1:56:20] maybe even before you believed,
[1:56:23] you were yearning for eternal life,
[1:56:28] what made you to y for eternal life?
[1:56:32] Because if I can tell you today,
[1:56:36] uh, let me ask those who are Malawians,
[1:56:39] don't don't raise your hands.
[1:56:43] Uh,
[1:56:46] who has ever tasted here?
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. I don't want the Malawians
[1:56:54] to answer. They know what I'm talking
[1:56:56] about.
[1:56:59] You see,
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; you people cannot have a desire of
[1:57:05] because you don't know it. You have
[1:57:07] never tasted it.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; You don't even know it.
[1:57:11] The only people who can have a desire of
[1:57:14] faith are those who have ever tested it
[1:57:17] before.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; So the only people who desire eternal
[1:57:25] life
[1:57:27] are those who have ever tested it
[1:57:29] before.
[1:57:32] [applause]
[1:57:33] Amen.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Because something inside you
[1:57:38] will be calling for that eternal life.
[1:57:46] I I know you are consuming a lot of
[1:57:49] hibiscus here in South Africa,
[1:57:53] South Africa
[1:57:55] at my home. That's relish.
[1:57:59] Yeah, we we we eat pap with it.
[1:58:04] It's a common herb.
[1:58:08] You don't even know how it tastes when
[1:58:09] it's a it's a vegetable.
[1:58:14] We even add a ground nut paste to it.
[1:58:17] It's very nice
[1:58:19] and you're drinking it as tea.
[1:58:24] Amen.
[1:58:26] I even plant it behind my house
[1:58:30] because I have tested it
[1:58:34] before. I know this one. If you do this,
[1:58:38] if you do this, it is good.
[1:58:42] Eternal life is the same.
[1:58:46] If you repent of your sins,
[1:58:49] if you live light,
[1:58:51] it tastes good.
[1:58:57] It tastes better.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; My brother
[1:59:05] My sister,
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; one day,
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; one day,
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; this bars of bones
[1:59:15] will hold me no more.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; You know the word is very very unfair.
[1:59:33] Amen.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; People underestimate you just for being
[1:59:37] black. What's What's
[1:59:40] you want us to be continue being
[1:59:42] underestimated for being black?
[1:59:50] It's very unfair.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; This is not a place to be.
[1:59:57] There's a better place.
[2:00:02] This is a place
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; so unfair.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Do you know that there are people who
[2:00:10] are poor
[2:00:12] without any of their problem?
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; They were just born poor. They die poor
[2:00:21] without wronging anybody.
[2:00:28] Some people are born in a family of rich
[2:00:31] people.
[2:00:34] They still even more
[2:00:45] because it's unfair.
[2:00:47] This world is unfair.
[2:00:50] This is not a place to be.
[2:00:53] The place to be
[2:00:55] is where our pastor is
[2:01:01] there. They are just greeting our
[2:01:03] brother,
[2:01:04] our beloved brother,
[2:01:07] our precious brother, our precious.
[2:01:11] Amen. There's no path there.
[2:01:16] There's no fascism there.
[2:01:19] There's no sectarianism there. It's all
[2:01:22] things of the earth.
[2:01:27] There's a land
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; that's fair.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; So in the book of Job,
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Job 19 verse 26,
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; 19:26,
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; what does it say?
[2:01:54] Chapter 19
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; verse 26.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Verse 26.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; And though after my skin worms destroy
[2:02:01] this body, yet in my flesh shall I see
[2:02:04] God.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; That that is the day which I would want
[2:02:14] to be much a black person because that
[2:02:16] day I will be very happy as a black
[2:02:18] person.
[2:02:22] because I want to SEE GOD IN MY SKIN.
[2:02:30] I want to see God in my flesh.
[2:02:36] That's the day which you know my brother
[2:02:40] that I'm not I'm not a common person.
[2:02:43] No no no no no.
[2:02:54] Malawian what can you do? Yes.
[2:02:57] But when I am there son of a king.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; 27
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; verse 27.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Whom I shall see my for myself.
[2:03:18] Nobody will see it for
[2:03:23] it will not be the cabinet seeing him
[2:03:25] and then they tell me no the president
[2:03:27] is all right.
[2:03:29] I shall see the king myself.
[2:03:34] Mine eyes,
[2:03:36] the same one, this one of mine
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; shall behold.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Mine eyes shall behold.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; So whenever you are called to
[2:03:53] the presence house, don't worry. That's
[2:03:55] nothing for me.
[2:03:57] That's nothing. Me I will see God.
[2:04:04] Me I will see God.
[2:04:07] You can see anybody which you want.
[2:04:10] You can you can you can tell yourself oh
[2:04:12] me I see I see Donald Trump that's fine.
[2:04:17] See Trump me I will see God himself.
[2:04:25] Hey my brother,
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; the pastor is there now.
[2:04:32] [applause]
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; If I was not sure that the pastor is not
[2:04:36] there today,
[2:04:39] I wouldn't have come from Malawi.
[2:04:45] Amen.
[2:04:47] I'm too sure about it.
[2:04:50] Amen.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; In here,
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; there are so many of you in here
[2:05:00] which shall see God.
[2:05:03] Amen.
[2:05:06] I cannot prevent you.
[2:05:08] You cannot prevent me.
[2:05:12] The only person who can prevent me from
[2:05:15] seeing God
[2:05:17] is me.
[2:05:27] Where's your enemy, my brother?
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Point him.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; It's me.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Where's your enemy, my brother?
[2:05:37] Where's your enemy? Number one
[2:05:40] is this one.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; You don't have an enemy worse than the
[2:05:47] one.
[2:05:52] Don't try to start pointing others as
[2:05:54] enemies.
[2:05:57] Enemy number one.
[2:06:00] [applause]
[2:06:01] The others are number two, number three,
[2:06:03] number four, number five, number six.
[2:06:06] But the worst enemy which you have
[2:06:09] which will prevent you from going to
[2:06:10] heaven
[2:06:12] is yourself.
[2:06:19] What is the pastor doing this morning?
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; We can go to the book of Samuel 28. 1
[2:06:25] Samuel 28
[2:06:27] Samuel 28 verse 14- 19.
[2:06:32] You should see what people of God do
[2:06:34] when they die.
[2:06:40] 1 Samuel 28:14.
[2:06:46] And he said unto her, "What form is he
[2:06:49] of?" And she said, "An old man cometh
[2:06:52] up, and he is covered with a mantle."
[2:06:56] And Saul perceived that it was Samuel.
[2:06:59] And he stood with his face to the
[2:07:01] ground, and bowed himself.
[2:07:04] And Samuel said to Saul, "Why hast thou
[2:07:07] dis disqued me?
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Disquited me.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Disquited me to bring me up." And Saul
[2:07:14] answered, "I am so distressed. For the
[2:07:17] Philistines
[2:07:19] make war against me, and God is departed
[2:07:22] from me," and answerth me no more,
[2:07:25] neither by prophets, nor by dreams.
[2:07:28] Therefore I have called thee that thou
[2:07:30] mightest make known unto me what I shall
[2:07:33] do. Then said Samuel, wherefore then
[2:07:37] doest thou asked me of seeing the Lord
[2:07:40] is departed from thee and is become
[2:07:45] thine enemy.
[2:07:47] And the Lord hath done to him as big by
[2:07:50] me. For the Lord hath rent the kingdom
[2:07:54] out of thine hand, and given it to thy
[2:07:57] neighbor, even to David.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Go ahead.
[2:08:01] 18. Because thou obeyest not the voice
[2:08:04] of the Lord, nor executest his fierce
[2:08:07] wrath upon Amalcch. Therefore have the
[2:08:10] Lord done this thing unto thee this day.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Again, another one. Moreover, the Lord
[2:08:16] will also deliver Israel with thee into
[2:08:19] the hand of Philistines, and tomorrow
[2:08:22] shall thou and thy sons be with me. The
[2:08:25] Lord also shall deliver the host of
[2:08:27] Israel into the hands of the
[2:08:29] Philistines.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; You see, he died a prophet,
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; he comes up,
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; he starts prophesying again.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; He's a prophet.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh I don't know how why we condemn
[2:08:45] each other so much.
[2:08:47] You can see here somewhere he's talking
[2:08:50] to so
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; according to all of us
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; was a backseed king
[2:09:00] but Samuel
[2:09:03] said to Saul
[2:09:05] you shall be with me this night.
[2:09:10] That's why David said
[2:09:12] these are God's anointed ones.
[2:09:18] So even Saul has got a portion in the in
[2:09:22] the in in the kingdom of God.
[2:09:26] Stop condemning one another
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; because how can you testify to a
[2:09:34] drunkard to come to be a believer
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; and you condemn me when I'm preaching
[2:09:40] the word here?
[2:09:45] I'm standing on the pit. You condemn me.
[2:09:48] Are you going to tell I drunk at a
[2:09:51] there's a good God. Let's go to heaven.
[2:09:58] Because
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; as for me,
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; since I was young,
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; I have known nothing apart from being
[2:10:07] here
[2:10:10] and you still condemn mem.
[2:10:13] Did you see some condemning the man says
[2:10:16] you be on this side with me?
[2:10:20] Hallelujah.
[2:10:22] Appreciate one another's fight.
[2:10:26] Your fight
[2:10:28] is not my fight.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; You know fights are different.
[2:10:39] A poor man fights with hunger.
[2:10:46] A rich man fights with constipation.
[2:10:53] He's
[2:10:57] fighting.
[2:10:59] There's no better place to be.
[2:11:11] Because one of the biggest problem we
[2:11:16] have in South Africa,
[2:11:19] too much food.
[2:11:23] It's a big problem
[2:11:28] in Malawi. We fight less food.
[2:11:33] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; All those are problems.
[2:11:37] There's no better place.
[2:11:41] When you are hungry, you are sick.
[2:11:44] When you are too much food, you are
[2:11:45] sick.
[2:11:51] Samuel
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; told so
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; tomorrow
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; you'll be with me.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; So if you can go to now we don't have to
[2:12:04] read because I I believe my I'm already
[2:12:06] above time. So you can see that even if
[2:12:10] you if you go to mount transfiguration
[2:12:13] Peter John and James
[2:12:16] when they saw Moses and Elijah
[2:12:18] Nobody had to tell them that is Moses
[2:12:20] that
[2:12:23] they themselves
[2:12:25] told us they saw Elijah and Moses.
[2:12:29] They themselves
[2:12:32] Moses had been dead for about 2,000
[2:12:33] years.
[2:12:35] Elijah had been dead for so many years.
[2:12:38] But these disciples,
[2:12:41] they immediately recognized
[2:12:43] that must be Moses. That must be Elijah.
[2:12:47] When you come come to Revelation 11:6,
[2:12:50] Revelation 11:6, when the Moses and
[2:12:52] Elijah are there with power to shut
[2:12:55] heaven,
[2:12:57] you know, the spirit of shutting heaven
[2:13:01] is of Elijah.
[2:13:04] The spirit of turning water into blood,
[2:13:09] you know that is
[2:13:12] the spirit of sming the earth with plas
[2:13:14] and at will.
[2:13:18] then you know that is Moses. So we don't
[2:13:21] need an interpretation
[2:13:23] because the prophet under the seven seas
[2:13:27] has opened our eyes of understanding
[2:13:32] and our eyes have seen the glory of the
[2:13:35] Lord.
[2:13:39] We have seen
[2:13:42] although it's it's a little bit blood
[2:13:46] we have seen.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; We have seen that the eternal life is
[2:13:50] about to come.
[2:13:57] So remember
[2:13:58] we live here in
[2:14:01] on earth in three dimensions
[2:14:05] which is light,
[2:14:08] matter and time.
[2:14:10] Our senses can contact them.
[2:14:14] But my brother, my sister, within this
[2:14:17] very room,
[2:14:19] there is another dimension moving.
[2:14:23] There are pictures moving inside here.
[2:14:26] There are phones moving inside here.
[2:14:28] Somebody's answering a phone behind
[2:14:30] there. The voice is passing through
[2:14:32] here.
[2:14:34] We can't see it. We can't hear it.
[2:14:37] Because we are not in that dimension.
[2:14:40] But if we can just lay eyes up to that
[2:14:42] dimension,
[2:14:44] we can see things.
[2:14:49] Our pastor
[2:14:51] is in a dimension higher.
[2:14:57] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; So there's a fourth dimension
[2:15:04] which is a communication channel.
[2:15:07] And there's a fifth dimension which
[2:15:10] we're going to talk about later on. But
[2:15:12] where we are at
[2:15:15] is the at the sixth dimension.
[2:15:18] the souls under the altar
[2:15:21] where our pastor is now.
[2:15:24] My brother, my sister, brother says,
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; when they are there, they are able to
[2:15:30] look at us back.
[2:15:35] [cheering]
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Let me get the quotation. I'll tell you
[2:15:38] they are able to look at us.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Let me get the the quotation says
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; I have it. I have it my brother.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Sister's pictures come through. No, I
[2:15:56] did underline it.
[2:16:00] [crying]
[2:16:02] Matter time to me. I I'll get it. Don't
[2:16:06] worry.
[2:16:14] How did it disappear?
[2:16:20] Let me
[2:16:26] let me just read this one. Go to present
[2:16:29] stage of my ministry.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Present stage of minist
[2:16:32] 0
[2:16:34] 9 08.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; I'll find it. Don't worry. I'll
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; just uh
[2:17:07] Yeah. Paragraph 26.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Uh, paragraph 26. Present stage of my
[2:17:12] ministry.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; That one.
[2:17:20] Now in this vision,
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; I believe I was caught to that sixth
[2:17:25] dimension.
[2:17:28] Looking back down here,
[2:17:32] could see back.
[2:17:34] Hallelujah.
[2:17:37] See
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; that's
[2:17:42] the site isn't exactly with eyes
[2:17:47] that's e3
[2:17:49] but sight is greater than
[2:17:53] so the sight they have there
[2:17:57] their contact is far beyond contact of
[2:17:59] our natural senses.
[2:18:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. How
[2:18:08] many are so happy that the pastor is
[2:18:10] looking at us?
[2:18:13] Hallelujah.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:21] One day
[2:18:23] a man
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; was um a blind man, a blind black man in
[2:18:28] a
[2:18:32] He was telling brother Bernham
[2:18:34] says have mercy have mercy
[2:18:37] there was segregation in Arkansas by
[2:18:39] that time.
[2:18:42] So he was standing on the other side of
[2:18:44] the Lord.
[2:18:46] Black people were supposed to be on the
[2:18:47] other side.
[2:18:49] So brother wanted to go and see that
[2:18:51] man.
[2:18:53] The brother the brother said
[2:18:56] don't do that. Don't do that. It will
[2:18:58] cause a riot.
[2:19:00] Abraham says, "If I don't go that side,
[2:19:03] I need to be on the water."
[2:19:07] So he went to that side.
[2:19:10] He he looked at this uh man. He said,
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; the man said, "My mother was a saintly
[2:19:19] woman. She worshiped God. Last night
[2:19:24] she came to say, "Son, go to that
[2:19:29] street. Stand on his place like this.
[2:19:32] When you will stand there, there will be
[2:19:35] a man of God
[2:19:37] who pass through there
[2:19:40] and you receive your sight."
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; His mama had been died for a long time.
[2:19:54] Some of our mothers are busy chasing us
[2:19:56] with the knives at night.
[2:20:10] Here is a good mama
[2:20:13] comes back to take care
[2:20:17] of her child.
[2:20:19] A sentient woman
[2:20:22] Hey, please sisters go go to heaven
[2:20:25] center. We need your help down here.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; You remember sister hope
[2:20:34] when when brother Brham
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; wanted to shoot himself, she came and
[2:20:40] put her hand around.
[2:20:44] Honey,
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; I am better off.
[2:20:48] Promise me that you're not going to do
[2:20:50] this. I will not leave until you promise
[2:20:56] that you'll be all right.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Brother, go and check. It was a little
[2:21:02] hand of hope
[2:21:06] in the grave holding brother.
[2:21:15] [applause]
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:21] They are there. They're seeing what we
[2:21:23] are doing.
[2:21:25] So, Hope was seeing what he was doing.
[2:21:28] Mama was seeing his boy suffering.
[2:21:31] That's why she came back
[2:21:34] to help her boy.
[2:21:37] So many places where you find things
[2:21:39] happening like that.
[2:21:41] You can even see here somewhere came up
[2:21:45] to speak to Saul.
[2:21:50] Amen.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; My brother
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; with a pastor,
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; we just in different rooms.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. [crying]
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; We which are alive
[2:22:09] shall caught up
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; because they are in a higher dimension.
[2:22:16] us will be caught up
[2:22:19] to meet them in the air.
[2:22:28] and my brother, my sister,
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; brother Bernham says
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; on the same on the same scripture verse
[2:22:36] 24 my brother go to the
[2:22:42] uh the same u book go to paragraph 20 24
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; paragraph 24 page
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; yeah 24 go 24 yeah
[2:22:55] now
[2:22:58] is in the seventh dimension.
[2:23:03] Now you see
[2:23:05] the Christian
[2:23:07] when he dies
[2:23:09] he goes under the altar.
[2:23:13] A Christian like you
[2:23:17] like you my brother. A Christian like
[2:23:19] you
[2:23:21] go under the altar of God
[2:23:24] right in the presence of God under the
[2:23:27] altar.
[2:23:30] At rest.
[2:23:36] At rest.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; Time is no more there.
[2:23:45] You know time is measured by the way the
[2:23:49] earth rotates.
[2:23:53] How the earth rotates around the sun.
[2:23:57] Um, how the sun rotates around the
[2:24:01] galaxy.
[2:24:05] I don't know why we live so proud here
[2:24:07] on Earth.
[2:24:13] Do you know that
[2:24:15] the sun
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; hasn't moved even 1% of the journey
[2:24:25] around the galaxy the whole the whole 80
[2:24:29] years of your life.
[2:24:33] If we were going to put a sequ as big as
[2:24:35] this
[2:24:38] as the se of the sun around the galaxy.
[2:24:43] All the life which you have lived here
[2:24:45] on earth
[2:24:47] is just a dot
[2:24:51] because the sun takes about 250 million
[2:24:53] years to move around.
[2:24:55] 250 million years
[2:25:00] and you are here. I am minister of
[2:25:03] security. I am minister of this.
[2:25:06] Minister of this.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; It's like a fly in my car from here to
[2:25:14] Johansburg.
[2:25:16] It lives only for seven days.
[2:25:25] When a fry lives for seven days, but you
[2:25:29] can take it in your car from here to
[2:25:30] John Bay.
[2:25:32] and you'll be very happy.
[2:25:38] Why are we proud of this life?
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; It's nothing.
[2:25:44] It's vanity.
[2:25:50] The only people who should be happy
[2:25:51] today
[2:25:53] are Christians
[2:25:57] because they got a better place. Amen.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Because somebody told me
[2:26:07] a clever man,
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; my brother,
[2:26:12] where you start from
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; is not a problem,
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; it's where you end.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; It's where you end. You should take care
[2:26:27] where you end because where you end.
[2:26:31] That's where you're going to stay a
[2:26:32] little bit longer.
[2:26:37] Jesus.
[2:26:40] My brother, my sister, if there are
[2:26:43] people who are clever,
[2:26:45] they cannot be clever than a Christian
[2:26:49] living a life for God.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; So our pastor was very clever. He knew a
[2:26:59] day like this
[2:27:01] will come
[2:27:03] and he was very very prepared.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; No, ask the people who are around him.
[2:27:12] He never sang as if he's saying ah
[2:27:17] you know sometimes we sing songs which
[2:27:19] are very
[2:27:21] not good
[2:27:25] if they are
[2:27:28] my troubles are so many
[2:27:33] you are praising your troubles.
[2:27:41] Hey, I don't know me. People just hate
[2:27:45] me for
[2:27:46] I don't know how I was. My friends have
[2:27:48] good friends. They don't like me.
[2:27:55] My friend,
[2:27:57] even today
[2:27:59] can come and pick me from here
[2:28:02] and push me to Malawi.
[2:28:05] I
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not outside the kingdom of God.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing I mind to me.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; I don't mind about being in this circle,
[2:28:19] that circle, this circle, the Kiwanis,
[2:28:23] the golf club, the club, club. Useless
[2:28:30] [cheering]
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; rat racing.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:38] the club of big pastors, the club of
[2:28:40] small pastors, the club of this, the
[2:28:43] club of that. I don't care about that.
[2:28:47] I want to belong to the kingdom of
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; I don't mind to be invited to your
[2:29:00] penthouse.
[2:29:06] My God,
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; he hides me in his pavilion.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; My God hides me where?
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; In my pavilion.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; In his
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; in his pavilion.
[2:29:25] Go and read this in the book of Psalms.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; I I'm invited to God's pavilion.
[2:29:32] So which place is better than God's
[2:29:34] perfect
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; my brother?
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to
[2:29:46] keep just imagine even even a place.
[2:29:50] What? What's that?
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; My headquarters. Where's your
[2:29:59] headquarters?
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; Headquarters.
[2:30:04] You go there alive,
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; you end up dead.
[2:30:16] I am going where there is life.
[2:30:20] I'm not going to go where there is my
[2:30:22] life is going to be lost.
[2:30:26] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Our pastor
[2:30:31] is in a better place today.
[2:30:35] Amen. Amen.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; You know, uh these things
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; we should talk about
[2:30:46] my brother. One day, one day, hey, I
[2:30:50] don't know.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; Um
[2:30:53] one day you see you are just there.
[2:31:03] Because God
[2:31:06] shall reward
[2:31:08] even a glass of water
[2:31:11] which you give to his people. What about
[2:31:14] you people who have lived the whole of
[2:31:15] your life.
[2:31:18] You have raised your families in this
[2:31:19] message. Even now even your
[2:31:21] grandchildren are growing up in this
[2:31:23] message.
[2:31:25] Oh what a good work for you. God bless
[2:31:27] you.
[2:31:29] God bless you.
[2:31:34] You know, most of the times we always
[2:31:35] want to focus on the negatives.
[2:31:41] We don't want to focus on the positives.
[2:31:46] My brother, my sister, you are a guarant
[2:31:49] soldier
[2:31:52] and uh you know there will be angels to
[2:31:56] pick you up.
[2:32:00] Amen.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; Where's my Okay, let me see.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; I my prayer might ask
[2:32:12] to this church as I'm closing
[2:32:16] is my brother. My brother, the person
[2:32:20] who sitting next to you
[2:32:22] is a son and daughter of God.
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Let's pray for one another.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; As we are mourning,
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; let's mourn in prayer.
[2:32:43] How will the people know
[2:32:46] that we are his disciples?
[2:32:50] When we love one another. Can I hear?
[2:32:55] Can I hear? I don't want to say
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; when we love one another.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; Then the people will say
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; these are
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; his disciples.
[2:33:16] Hallelujah.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; Um
[2:33:22] I encourage my young men
[2:33:27] uh to buy good clothes and good cars.
[2:33:32] Those of you who are graduates and you
[2:33:34] are walking, pray until you get a car.
[2:33:42] That's not humility. That's a disgrace.
[2:33:48] pray God to give you because there's no
[2:33:52] way can be given to Pentecostals and not
[2:33:54] to give you
[2:33:57] but I don't like people to form clubs in
[2:34:00] the church.
[2:34:06] [applause and cheering]
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; Open the doors.
[2:34:17] Amen.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; One of you when you have bonus one day,
[2:34:21] just take all of us to go and eat at the
[2:34:23] hotel.
[2:34:28] Why do you want to eat all the money
[2:34:29] yourself?
[2:34:33] Aren't you tired eating of eating all
[2:34:34] the money?
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; We don't love one another. We people.
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; The only time we eat is when
[2:35:00] one day invite us.
[2:35:03] Let's love one another.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; One day
[2:35:16] I'll be in a box gone
[2:35:20] without even eating your money.
[2:35:25] You don't love me.
[2:35:31] One day you would wish you have done me
[2:35:33] better,
[2:35:36] but I will not be able to respond.
[2:35:41] That's why the pastor said, "Let me be
[2:35:44] among the people who loved me when I
[2:35:46] was."
[2:35:52] Hallelujah.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; Let's love one another when we are
[2:35:55] alive.
[2:35:58] [applause]
[2:36:01] Some of you,
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; the only day which you cry for me
[2:36:06] is when I'm dead.
[2:36:08] What will it do for me? You are supposed
[2:36:10] to cry for me now
[2:36:13] that I should be a better person than
[2:36:15] what I am right now.
[2:36:18] Cry for me now because the day will come
[2:36:22] even if you cry for me. It will not help
[2:36:24] me.
[2:36:28] This is a better day to cry for one
[2:36:30] another.
[2:36:33] Brother says, "Don't entertain a bad
[2:36:38] thought against one another."
[2:36:46] Because
[2:36:47] you know this
[2:36:50] bad thoughts about one another,
[2:36:54] let alone plotting against one another
[2:36:59] will give you cancer.
[2:37:04] Brother says that
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; what we need to do my brother my sister
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; if we want to be seen as his disciples
[2:37:18] it's not who has got a quotation which
[2:37:19] is bigger than mine.
[2:37:26] If your quotation
[2:37:28] can't keep us together
[2:37:31] is not a good one
[2:37:34] [applause]
[2:37:36] [cheering]
[2:37:38] is a quotation of contion
[2:37:45] because all the things which you should
[2:37:47] be talking about here
[2:37:50] with one another it's love.
[2:38:00] What type of love?
[2:38:06] The type of love which they do at the
[2:38:07] tavern
[2:38:10] in the tavern. There will be a group
[2:38:12] there,
[2:38:13] another group there. Those guys have got
[2:38:15] knives and guns.
[2:38:19] This branch here got even knives and
[2:38:22] guns. is that
[2:38:26] so they say you
[2:38:29] you know um
[2:38:32] I'll say something
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; don't get worried I I'll say something.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; Um Russia
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; and America
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; they discuss peace.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; So
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; America comes
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; put that that behind you. Put it behind
[2:38:53] you like that. No, put it behind.
[2:38:58] So everybody has carried a nuclear
[2:39:00] behind.
[2:39:05] My brother, we should discuss peace.
[2:39:11] [applause]
[2:39:16] This is a peace between Russia and
[2:39:18] America
[2:39:21] behind here.
[2:39:22] Everybody's having his nuclear
[2:39:26] and everyone say ah this peace.
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; No that pe type of peace is not peace.
[2:39:36] &gt;&gt; Peace will always prevail
[2:39:40] when we people
[2:39:42] love one another.
[2:39:48] [applause]
[2:39:57] you know uh if you can go uh among the
[2:40:02] you know the country in transit guys
[2:40:08] they tell each other I like this guy
[2:40:11] because he's honest when we hit
[2:40:22] You see
[2:40:25] that type of love
[2:40:27] outside the word is not love.
[2:40:33] Love
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; has to be inside the word.
[2:40:41] When you love one another,
[2:40:44] love each other inside.
[2:40:51] When you pray for someone
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; and you don't have a feeling for them,
[2:40:59] that prayer is nothing.
[2:41:04] The only prayer
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; which will prevail
[2:41:09] when you
[2:41:11] enter into their shoes.
[2:41:16] You be like them.
[2:41:19] That is how miracles happen
[2:41:23] because you are a high priest
[2:41:27] who is touched by our
[2:41:30] extremities.
[2:41:32] You have to be touched.
[2:41:34] You have to share the problem.
[2:41:38] Jesus shares our problems.
[2:41:42] Our pastor was sharing our problem.
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; Hey
[2:41:54] church,
[2:41:56] the pastor is gone.
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; The pastor is gone.
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; He took care of us very
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; We thank God for a man
[2:42:15] who came
[2:42:17] gave his life for us,
[2:42:20] lived as our pastor,
[2:42:22] never took advantage of us.
[2:42:28] [applause]
[2:42:31] Amen.
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; Brothers,
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; people have sold their houses and given
[2:42:50] them to their pastors.
[2:42:53] People have eaten grass in their pastors
[2:42:55] loans.
[2:43:00] People have taken the whole of their
[2:43:01] patients and given them to their
[2:43:02] pastors. Our
[2:43:05] pastor didn't do that.

[2:43:31] the Lord.

[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; This responsibility
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; should be the way the pastor had
[2:45:44] responsibility for us.
[2:45:50] your responsibility
[2:45:55] each and every one of you
[2:45:58] individually
[2:46:00] don't say no we'll take from the church
[2:46:02] bag
[2:46:04] by the time we be realizing somebody has
[2:46:06] been sleeping hungry for two days
[2:46:10] you
[2:46:12] let it lead you to say that the pastor
[2:46:15] is not there don't say yeah I saw
[2:46:18] somebody bringing

[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; So we as people
[2:46:32] let's have enough revelation
[2:46:37] that mama will need our care.
[2:46:42] Amen. Or you want mama to go and work in
[2:46:44] shoplight.
[2:46:49] Okay.

[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; I believe that is a promise to me.
[2:46:56] &gt;&gt; Take care. [applause]
[2:47:02] Hallelujah.
[2:47:05] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[2:47:07] We are heavenly father.
[2:47:09] It's our commitment.
[2:47:13] It's our promise to our pastor that even
[2:47:16] if he has gone, me and these people will
[2:47:20] continue living a life.
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; Until we catch up with him in the
[2:47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:27] [applause]
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; Help us, father.
[2:47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; He has gone without fearing death.
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; I was there with him. He never feared
[2:47:37] death even an inch. He went home singing
[2:47:41] the songs of Zion.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; We also as we are struggling on in this
[2:47:46] life, give us a the same psalms which
[2:47:49] you gave to our pastor.
[2:47:52] &gt;&gt; Because one day Herod was asking why are
[2:47:57] these people not afraid of death?
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; Because they the people told them
[2:48:02] because they got Jesus.
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord Jesus, we want the same God.
[2:48:10] We want the same [music]
[2:48:12] Holy Spirit to be among us. We have said
[2:48:16] things today which couldn't be said when
[2:48:18] the whole people are visiting us are
[2:48:20] here. [music] This is just among
[2:48:22] ourselves.
[2:48:23] Lord Jesus, let it that revelation which
[2:48:26] you give in our hearts. Lord be upon us.
[2:48:31] Brother Brham told us that if you love
[2:48:33] me, you love my children.
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; Help us, father. But the same revelation
[2:48:40] should be upon us. Help us, father. We
[2:48:45] need you more than ever before.
[2:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; The I wouldn't want to be ashamed to
[2:48:52] meet my pastor one day.
[2:48:54] And with all knowing the pastor should
[2:48:57] know that I am the one who's denying
[2:48:59] food to his wife and his children.
[2:49:02] Father God help me not as a church as an
[2:49:07] individual
[2:49:10] [applause]
[2:49:12] that we should always remember that your
[2:49:16] servant has left us our
[2:49:18] responsibilities.
[2:49:20] Help us, Father, as we are continuing on
[2:49:23] morning our pastor. Let us love one
[2:49:26] another.
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; Give us peace. The same peace which you
[2:49:30] talked about when you are on the Sea of
[2:49:32] Galilee. When the waves were going
[2:49:35] against the ship, you said to the
[2:49:37] waters, which mean people, peace, be
[2:49:41] still.
[2:49:43] &gt;&gt; Help us, Father. Bind us with codes of
[2:49:46] love. Amen.
[2:49:48] &gt;&gt; As we're committing everything into
[2:49:49] thine holy hands, Father, young and old,
[2:49:53] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[2:49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:59] [applause]
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't he looking wonderful? He's looking
[2:50:12] much better than that
[2:50:16] because that one is an old man.
[2:50:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because he's not looking like
[2:50:22] that.
[2:50:24] He's younger now.
[2:50:27] 25.
[2:50:30] Amen. [applause]
[2:50:33] We thank God
[2:50:35] for what he done has done for us.
[2:50:39] &gt;&gt; Church.
[2:50:41] be comforted.
[2:50:42] &gt;&gt; For we who are alive
[2:50:45] shall be caught up.
[2:50:48] Amen. Amen.
[2:50:52] God bless you my brother. Amen. Amen.
[2:50:55] God bless you my brother.
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:10] for the Lord.
[2:51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:51:16] &gt;&gt; Pastor, God bless you.
[2:51:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you richly.
[2:51:21] &gt;&gt; We really appreciate.
[2:51:24] &gt;&gt; We are comforted.
[2:51:26] Amen. Amen.
[2:51:27] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[2:51:29] God bless you.
[2:51:36] We don't have baptisms today.
[2:51:39] So I just want to take this opportunity
[2:51:46] to welcome
[2:51:48] the believers from
[2:51:50] pastor Zakula
[2:51:56] if they can stand.
[2:51:59] They just arrived late but they are
[2:52:00] here.
[2:52:03] They came with an elder
[2:52:06] my brother. God bless you.
[2:52:08] &gt;&gt; Can we just say shalom to the church?
[2:52:11] [applause]
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:52:18] &gt;&gt; That title looks so so heavy for me.
[2:52:23] &gt;&gt; Uh I'm brother Daniel [music]
[2:52:26] &gt;&gt; from Amen Tabernacle Tabernacle. Uh
[2:52:31] we just thought of uh coming here today
[2:52:36] &gt;&gt; because I believe we you know the
[2:52:39] relationship that your church had this
[2:52:41] church has had with a tabernacle.
[2:52:47] When we speak about a tabernacle history
[2:52:52] &gt;&gt; here in South Africa,
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; we cannot speak about it without
[2:52:56] mentioning pastor
[2:53:01] and [applause]
[2:53:07] the pastor Zak is not around.
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; He's in Congo
[2:53:12] and he called me throughout the day.
[2:53:17] He was in disbelief.
[2:53:19] Uh papa said, "I don't know how you
[2:53:22] going to deal with this
[2:53:25] countless time. He's been wanting to
[2:53:28] come to see the elder."
[2:53:31] And uh the last time that he was
[2:53:33] supposed to come again,
[2:53:36] I think uh we were we we have been told
[2:53:38] that the pastor wasn't well
[2:53:42] and uh unfortunately he's not really
[2:53:45] it's not sitting well with him that he
[2:53:47] did not see him.
[2:53:53] He's been calling asking me how true
[2:53:55] this information is.
[2:53:59] &gt;&gt; And I said yes, it was true.
[2:54:01] when I got the confirmation.
[2:54:04] &gt;&gt; But nonetheless, he called me again
[2:54:08] and he is in deep shock.
[2:54:12] Very deep shock that he had to travel
[2:54:14] somewhere again. He even cancelceled it
[2:54:18] and he's trying to see if he can arrange
[2:54:21] things in order for him to be back here.
[2:54:25] But [music] uh we have lost an icon in
[2:54:28] the message.
[2:54:35] At times we don't realize how great
[2:54:37] somebody is up until
[2:54:42] I have been receiving countless number
[2:54:44] of calls about him.
[2:54:48] But nonetheless,
[2:54:51] we are with you at heart.
[2:54:53] We just came here so that we can comfort
[2:54:56] you as well
[2:54:59] and tell you we are together.
[2:55:02] His departure is not the end.
[2:55:05] He actually took the baton and has
[2:55:06] passed it on to us
[2:55:10] and let's make sure
[2:55:14] his [snorts] legacy lives on.
[2:55:20] I came with three brothers from the
[2:55:22] church,
[2:55:23] &gt;&gt; two brothers and a sister. I came with
[2:55:25] brother Trident.
[2:55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Trident is he a minister
[2:55:30] &gt;&gt; right at the back there is a minister at
[2:55:32] the church.
[2:55:34] Then uh we have got brother Silas
[2:55:38] the youth leader in the church
[2:55:42] and there is also a sister assistant in
[2:55:44] the church.
[2:55:47] thought is best we just come and
[2:55:48] sabotage along with you.
[2:55:52] May the Lord bless you.
[2:55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:01] &gt;&gt; Pastor,
[2:56:04] we are honored that you are here.
[2:56:08] Can you also say shalom to the church?
[2:56:11] Shalom. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[2:56:22] Shalom church. Shalom.
[2:56:31] The passing away of our pastor.
[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; Myself as well. After hearing about the
[2:56:35] passing of our pastor,
[2:56:38] &gt;&gt; I was deeply concerned
[2:56:42] because
[2:56:45] because I'm one of those who was brought
[2:56:47] up by the past.
[2:56:50] &gt;&gt; 1976.
[2:56:52] &gt;&gt; I since knew him in the years of 1976.
[2:56:59] I still remember
[2:57:01] another year. I think it's 1987.
[2:57:07] 1987.
[2:57:11] I visited him at his home.
[2:57:14] While he was still staying in Maban,
[2:57:20] I was with my firstborn daughter.
[2:57:26] Her name is Sister Priscilla.
[2:57:30] When I arrived at the home of the
[2:57:31] pastor,
[2:57:34] that's when Aquila was born.
[2:57:41] So the pastor gave the brother the name
[2:57:43] Akida because Priscilla has come.
[2:57:50] &gt;&gt; Do we still remember?
[2:57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:53] So
[2:57:58] it's an old man that I'm saying he
[2:58:00] brought us up.
[2:58:01] &gt;&gt; I still remember
[2:58:05] back in the years
[2:58:09] When we had the conventions in Tefl,
[2:58:14] &gt;&gt; he was teaching us the word.
[2:58:18] He will take the entire convention
[2:58:23] preaching to us.
[2:58:27] So
[2:58:31] yesterday I had an emergency to rush to
[2:58:33] Captain Park. So when I finish
[2:58:36] everything there,
[2:58:39] I tell my I'm with my wife here.
[2:58:42] I tell my wife that
[2:58:46] I should go to mommy tomorrow.
[2:58:49] So that's why I'm here
[2:58:52] just to comfort the church
[2:58:56] [music]
[2:58:58] as the pastor has preached.
[2:59:04] Don't cry not having hope because this
[2:59:08] life
[2:59:11] it doesn't end here.
[2:59:17] There's still another life ahead of us
[2:59:19] that is better than this one.
[2:59:25] [music] That is why I'm saying
[2:59:28] family and the church
[2:59:30] be ye comforted.
[2:59:34] That is how God has planned it
[2:59:38] and in God there is no mistake.
[2:59:42] It is his plan
[2:59:46] and that is how he has planned things
[2:59:49] and the pastor
[2:59:50] &gt;&gt; I used to tell people
[2:59:56] that every person who came here on earth
[2:59:59] &gt;&gt; has a purpose. is unfortunately
[3:00:05] don't know your own purpose.
[3:00:09] But then we thank God
[3:00:12] that he knew his purpose
[3:00:18] and we believe that if God [music]
[3:00:20] decided to take him
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; that means his purpose was accomplished.
[3:00:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[3:00:31] Amen. God bless you.
[3:00:34] Brother,
[3:00:37] &gt;&gt; if you can come forth [music] to read
[3:00:39] the message,
[3:00:41] then we will sing a song after and we
[3:00:44] are dismissed.
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[3:00:59] Shalom saints.
[3:01:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the condolences to the
[3:01:06] family and the church at large.
[3:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:14] Dearly beloved of the Lord,
[3:01:17] it was with great sadness that I awoke
[3:01:21] the other morning to hear that my elder
[3:01:24] brother had been taken to glory.
[3:01:26] Although I am happy that he no longer
[3:01:29] has to suffer in this world, I am
[3:01:33] saddened by the fact that the baiton
[3:01:36] which he carried in this final push to
[3:01:40] the finish line has been dropped. I had
[3:01:43] made reservations to come to the
[3:01:45] convention to hear more of the subject
[3:01:48] of the whit stone interpretation
[3:01:52] since that was the very theme of these
[3:01:55] meetings. As you may recall, he said
[3:01:57] that he would speak of the white stone
[3:02:00] again. It is my prayer that God will
[3:02:03] rise up someone who will pick up the
[3:02:05] baiton again with the same inspiration.
[3:02:09] Carry this subject further. Elijah was
[3:02:13] not
[3:02:15] Elijah was not simply carried by the
[3:02:18] chariots to glory but threw down his
[3:02:21] mantle to be used for double glory. May
[3:02:25] there be someone who will be used for
[3:02:28] his for this final sprint. Your brother
[3:02:32] and elder Raid Gabrielson from Florida.
[3:02:44] I have shockingly learned of the passing
[3:02:47] of our beloved pastor. May his soul rest
[3:02:51] in peace beyond the kitten of time. He
[3:02:54] has fought a good fight of faith and
[3:02:57] finished the course. What a life to
[3:02:59] emulate. Godly used him to expound and
[3:03:04] make clear to the world what the seventh
[3:03:07] seal is. We are beneficiaries of that
[3:03:10] revelation.
[3:03:12] May the Lord help us to leave to leave
[3:03:15] it as we wait for the rapture.
[3:03:17] Condolences to the entire Maloi church
[3:03:20] in these hard times. All glory should go
[3:03:23] to the Lord Jesus Christ who does all
[3:03:25] things sovereignly in his own appointed
[3:03:28] time. [music]
[3:03:29] He cares and he will take care of me
[3:03:32] church. God bless you my precious
[3:03:35] brother Meti and your family.

[3:04:27] Dear brothers and sisters in Christ, on
[3:04:30] behalf of the entire evening light
[3:04:33] ministry tabernacle in Cotto and in my
[3:04:37] own name, we extend our deepest
[3:04:39] condolences following the homegoing of
[3:04:42] pastor Israel of pastor Muima Israel. We
[3:04:45] receive the news of his passing with
[3:04:48] deep sorrow and we share in our grief
[3:04:51] during this difficult time. Yet we are
[3:04:54] comforted by the blessed hope found in
[3:04:57] the word of God. But I would not have
[3:05:01] you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
[3:05:04] them which are asleep, that ye sorrow
[3:05:07] not, even as others which have no hope.
[3:05:10] For if we believe that Jesus died
[3:05:13] [music] and rose again, even so them
[3:05:16] also which sleep in Jesus [music]
[3:05:19] will God bring with him. 1 Thessalonians
[3:05:22] 4:13-14.
[3:05:29] In continuation, we also hold firmly to
[3:05:33] this assurance. The Lord is nigh. Unto
[3:05:36] them that are of a broken heart, [music]
[3:05:40] and saveth such be of a a a contrite
[3:05:45] spirit. Psalm 34:18.
[3:05:48] We pray that the Lord will grant you the
[3:05:51] berieved family and the entire church
[3:05:54] the strength, peace, and comfort needed
[3:05:56] to walk through this season of sorrow.
[3:05:59] Please receive the expression of our
[3:06:01] heartfelt compassion and our brotherly
[3:06:04] love in Christ with all our love in
[3:06:07] Jesus. Pastor Roland Kujo
[3:06:12] and the entire evening light minister
[3:06:14] tabernacle in Cottono Republic of Ben.
[3:06:23] May the soul of our beloved pastor rest
[3:06:26] in eternal peace. My memory of his
[3:06:29] service to the Liilonge goes back to the
[3:06:33] time he used to drive by road from
[3:06:36] Pertoria to Liil Longe and we would host
[3:06:39] him in humble dwellings in area 23 in
[3:06:43] the early '90s. God has been good to the
[3:06:46] Longa church for maintaining Christ's
[3:06:49] love with pastor. He pledged his support
[3:06:53] to the longer congregation for his
[3:06:56] lifetime. And we are witness to this
[3:06:58] pledge as we mourn the departure of our
[3:07:01] precious brother with [music] fond
[3:07:04] memories and give glory to God for his
[3:07:07] wondrous grace. Amen. Pastor Mawira
[3:07:11] Malawi.
[3:07:17] God bless you my precious friend. I
[3:07:20] can't believe what I'm hearing. My
[3:07:22] precious brother and pastor.
[3:07:25] My most sincere condolences to you and
[3:07:28] family and congregation. We recently was
[3:07:31] talking about him that he was so strong.
[3:07:34] We remember him with gratitude and
[3:07:36] respect. God gives you God gives you and
[3:07:40] all the church strength and wisdom to
[3:07:42] continue doing the great work that you
[3:07:45] have been doing in South Africa. God
[3:07:48] bless and keep me in touch with funeral
[3:07:50] arrangement pastor Hugo USA.
[3:07:58] Oh dear, what a loss to the body of
[3:08:02] Christ. He was a great blessing to many.
[3:08:05] May the good Lord comfort the church,
[3:08:08] the family, relatives and friends. May
[3:08:12] his good work accompany him. pastors
[3:08:15] from Uganda.

[3:08:32] shall meet him someday. [music]
[3:08:35] And please be comforted. Brother Elisha
[3:08:38] Gubisa from Zambia.
[3:08:44] Good morning saint. Our pastor is in the
[3:08:47] sixth dimension. [music] He saw us

[3:08:52] him prior to his departure. That is our
[3:08:55] consolation. Be still and know that I am
