Description:
Title: Changing from natural to Supernatural 
Preached by Elder Peter Skosana at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 27 October 2024

John 5:21,25 & 28| 1 Corinthians 15:45| Genesis 2:7| Proverbs 25:28| Proverbs 16:32

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the Changing from natural to supernatural.

As the seed of Abraham we need to know what is suitable for us at this hour.
We need to engage ourselves with the relevant sermon and relevant ministry. 
Your power is when you do the right thing at the right time.

When we recognise the relevance of this Word at this time, then God will support that, because we are aware of His promise. 
The sermon should be able to tell you what God is doing today to you. What is expected from God, what is it that we expect from God. 
The White stone is the promise that was aligned to us. 

The prophet says watch Russia king of the North, it is a prophecy that comes from the prophet. Russia has a missile which can destroy the whole world, it is only the bride that is blocking that from happening, because it cannot happen while we are here. 

You have to change from the natural to the Supernatural, but before it changes there should be a squeeze, so we are waiting for the squeeze. 
When Abraham body was changed, Sarah’s body was also changed, like it never had been changed before in a way that they could receive the promise son after being justified, sanctified filled with the Holy Spirit, changed by election. The body was changed in order to receive a promise son.  

The rapture has to do with the changing of the body. The only thing we are waiting for is the squeeze. 
We don’t have to relax we should know what’s coming. 
Rapture is not an imaginary thing; it is a promise that it should happen. Changing from natural to supernatural it is a promise, God promised that.
The Third pull has now been vindicated, it has been justified, proved to be correct.  It cannot be impersonated. 

When you say the Word is now in the bride that is ...

amen amen so he will be here next amen apart from that we are all happy the Believers are in a good mood a spiritual amen amen God bless you uh perap let's read John chapter 5 let's read verse 2125 and 28 2125 28 John chapter 5 verse 21 for as the father raiseth up the dead and Quicken them even so the son Quicken whom he will verse 25 verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live verse 28 Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice okay let's let's bow our head heavenly father Yes father with our heads bow Lord we deem this our responsibility that whenever we approach this moment yes Lord we invite you because without thee Lord we won't make it because this Pulpit is yours yes and when you descend you descend upon this pulpit and father you have made also a Pulpit in the heart of men yes which you claim it is yours father when you created us you made your own pulpit in our hearts so father we open our hearts and invite you yes to come and take your place Lord amen and speak to us father we are so grateful father to have a moment where whereby we'll just keep quiet and hear thee speaking to us and we feel so blessed father Amen to have a Ministry yes Lord of the revelation of the seven seed yes Lord amen that empowers us with the power of the third pool may you take control father of each and every situation yes may you bless us Lord may you engage us that we pray calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated okay my title here it will be the changing from natural to Supernatural why are we saying that changing from natural to Supernatural because according to the process of events like I once say we at so now as the Seed of Abraham we need uh to know exactly what is suitable for us at this hour and then as long as we uh engage ourself with uh the relevant sermon and relevant Ministry then we are empowered are we together the power you know where is your power is when you do the right thing at the right time now if you are a father and you are aware that your son recognize that you are the father [Music] now it gives you power as the father to empower your son now when we as the Bride of our Lord Jesus Christ recognized the relevancy of the word at this time then God will support that because we are aware of his promises but but if we just preach up hazard it will be the word of God but irrelevant I mean if I can maybe start telling you say is the message say my message today is crossing the Red Sea then I told I I read the scripture and I tell you how did Moses cross the Red Sea and close the service then but you still need what God is doing today to you yes I told you about Moses but you still have a question mark about the things that you want now where are we right now okay our ministry uh I mean the Bible itself has got some promises are we together those promises came in the form of Dreams some of visions and some of prophecies the prophecy I mean the the promises of the time that you living you are now Beyond time isn't it you have crossed over you are Beyond now when you are beyond what is expected from God and what are you expecting are we together amen right let's touch a little spe of the prophecies or the dreams we we had a a major Dream by Brother Jun you know about that of the mountain brother was teaching then he took a crowbar and cut off the and when they look inside it was a white stone then he said okay I'm going westwards keep on looking at that is why the pastor does not shift from the White St because it's a promise and it was a dream that is in with us and the prophet saw seven ma visions that has to do with us now these seven major Visions they the first one was mus you know about it the the second one was hit so those things he saw them before then you know the third one was ISS FIS naism communism then communism will swallow them all now communism has swallowed them all and then he said watch right Russia King of the North it's a prophecy that come from the prophet and we are seeing what Russia is doing are we together and then he also spoke about science and then he went on speaking about the immorality of the world all those now we are left with two the one is H the the woman president there's a power in America that comes due to a popular vote by women which we might say it's in process the last one will be America being in De with [Music] Russia Russia will destroy America it was seen by the Russia has got a which can destroy the whole world it's it's only you the bride that is blocking that thing because it can happen while you are SLE the Bible says it says there will be wars and rumors of aren't we seeing that that is in line now with uh the visions that the so okay amen now in order that we should go this natural body has to change to a supernatural but before it changes there should be a squeeze so which means then what we are waiting for is the squeeze mind you we're talking about the changing from the natural to a supernatural you have to change from the natural to a superal amen now let me start by reading a code here I didn't give the technical team that quote but it's on this book Abraham and his seat Abraham and his seat after him it's a paragraph 79 amen now it says here now we're talking about Chang when Abraham Abraham's body was changed Sarah's body was changed when Abraham's body was changed and s's body also was changed like it never had been changed before in a way that they could receive the promised son after being justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Spirit Changed by election the manifested god of Glory in the midst of him right amen and then the body was changed in order to receive the promised son right amen the next thing happened to Abraham was a changed body parag paragraph 18 he had to have it never had a son and the next thing that happens to the church is the rapture right amen now in order that there should be a Rapture uh the Rapture has to do with the changing of your body so actually what we are waiting for now it's it's the squeeze you know when Israel was in Egypt the only way that he could go out of Egypt she has to be be squeezed otherwise they wouldn't go out that is why some of them on the way they kept on looking backwards thinking about the big ports of far right so those people would have never going out right that's why there was a squeeze they started killing their sons they start enslaving them then they started calling upon their they started remembering their promise because Abraham said you'll be in bondage but I'll come and pick you up take you out now they started reading those scriptures when when are you coming Lord amen right amen because of the squeeze now we don't have to relax we should know what is coming let let me let me read you uh this book here Look Away to Jesus paragraph 39 amen now but when that time [Music] comes uh when the squeeze come down then you'll see what what's what's what what you've seen temporarily be manifested in fullness of its you see amen you have to know what have you seen temporary says what you've seen temporary that that has been manifested what I'm saying is that now there is something that has been manifested temporarily [Music] so that very same thing it will be manifested in the fullness of it right amen that there's something that God has to do to you so that when that time comes you must must be able to go amen now going being raptured it's not an imaginary thing it's the Fulfillment of the wi it's it's the promise that it should happen amen right uh First Corinthians I I I love this scripture chapter 15 ver 45 15 ver 45 so now changing from natural to Supernatural it's a promise God has promised you you must be aware right amen can you read it my brother amen and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit amen yeah you see now we're talking here about the the living soul and the quickening spirit amen now let me while I'm still on the what you call the squeeze that came down there's another code here it's still look away to Jesus Look Away to Jesus amen now in paragraph We were reading paragraph 39 listen what paragraph 38 says now so now I'm going to say something to you that hav that I haven't said all along and that is the thing that we have looked forward to for so long for at least more than for at least many years four or five years or maybe long now he says here the third pool has now been Vindicated it means it's Justified remember why I'm reading this I'm supporting paragraph 399 where it says there's something that you have seen temporar being manifested that is the third point it's temporarily being manifested but now when it comes in full that's why he says now the third pool has been Vindicated which means it mean it has been Justified it has been proved to be correct amen right amen I'm sure you all know what it is because it has to do with the manifestations of the sons of God now how can the sons of God be manifested it should be the word of God that's why the prophet said the word is now in the bride when when it says the word is in the bride that is pool right amen is the revelation of the seventh SE then it gives you power that power is the third pool now it says that power has now been Vindicated I'm sure you know about it when when when when our Lord Jesus Christ manifested the third pool he went to hell and took the keys from the devil so the third pool is taking the keys from the what did our Lord Jesus Christ said to Peter he said upon this road I will build my church the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against which means the in hell with the level of the of the Devil Himself the level of his angels level of of of of demons the level of the souls so he says those things when they come out it is called the gates they come through the gates now those keys that Peter had with the bride so the those Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you there's quite a number of them they come in different forms we because we are blacks we know about the people that go to the rivers and things like that are some other nations that theyve got those gates in different ways so the third pool is capable to close down those that is why he says I'm sure you all know what it is among you there were those that were s they can tell you among you there are those that were devil worshippers here they worshiping God free now see the ministry has managed to go and fet them out of and clean them up and they sitting here they say hallelujah hallelujah are we together that is what we call the third P now that's why he says that is just a temporal one right but when it comes into his fullness say the that pool has now been Vindicated then vers paragraph 39 says 39 now remember there'll never be an impersonation of that because it can't be see it cannot be right it cannot be impersonated it just happened so it could identify its presence among you [Music] it's it its presence see but it will not be used in a great will until the councel begins to tighten up there is what we call the World Council of churches they're busy tightening changing the Bible putting on some new laws now the prophet says it will not be used in great power the third until the acumenical C start to Tien up but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you will see what you've been seen temporarily you'll see what has been seen temporarily be manifested in fullness of his power that will be you now but in the Supernatural so the ministry is changing you from uh natural to Supernatural okay let's go to that uh Genesis chapter 2 we read verse seven verse S Genesis 2 2 ver7 and the Lord God formed men of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul right now and the Lord God formed not created right amen amen man of the dust and breath unto his nostril the breath of life after I breathed the Breath of Life Man became a living Soul remember we read about the first Adam who was made a living Stone [Music] and the second item a quickening spirit now I'm reading question and answers and answers to to clarify what we have read paragraph 33 right now we are on roote the ministry now is the ministry of the angels to the angels now it's it's no more a Ministry of say don't do that don't do that it's now he that is filthy let him continue there's nothing that you can do you know when when Jesus said one of you who will deep with me there's nothing that Judas could do the only thing that he could do is to de [Applause] he's the son of pedition and the one that is filthy he is predestinated for condemnation you can't change him after such powerful messages that the pastor now if he hasn't changed then then what are you going to do and let let you who is Holy continue how we get so then it says uh paragraph 330 question and answers M here it says the one that was or you've got it says but as soon as it is born in this world and breathe its first breath it becomes a living Soul there's a Celestial body or a spiritual body just to take hold of it as soon as this natural body is dropped there is a Heavenly Tabernacle waiting for [Music] it I jump then I go to it says now and as soon as the spiritual body sorry as soon as the natural body is dissolved a spiritual body is waiting let's go back again because as soon as the Earthly body is Born Into the world a Celestial body or spiritual body to take hold of it as soon as this natural body is dropped there is Heavenly Tabernacle right amen now the other way around now as soon as soon as the natural body is dissolved a spiritual body is waiting you on now all those things it's one from the supernatural the one from natural and the other one is from superal I explain what I've just read amen now in this book it come it becometh us to F to fulfill righteousness I'm reading paragraph for 14 did you ever notice that a little baby when it's born it's its little muscles twiching and checking but when it comes to the Earth it receives a spirit then it becomes a living soul as soon as the soul goes back from that little body there is another one waiting for it because first God makes the Soul and Spirit it just goes to the body and when we leave here we only change Dwelling Places and go to one and go to another one right he he went on and read Genesis chapter 2 said there was no man to te the ground you know that's why he made that uh at ly Body Spirit right I meanly image but then and he put the spirit of man in the animal man he became a living Soul now because uh he didn't a soul now I'm jumping I'm not reading everything paragraph 17 says but there the differ between the animal and the [Music] man he made a soul for a man that is a living Soul because the spirit of God was in the man the spirit of spirit of God was in the man then God made a living soul for that man are we together and as a child you grow into being a living [Music] soul and at the age of of choice you share the gospel in some way and something down inside you tells you to receive it right amen and you say well I'm too young I'll wait a little longer now there's where you make your first mistake because there's something within you that tells you and you are saying I'm still young are for the the old people and old women that's that's where you you make your first mistake right there for you grieve the person inside you there's a person inside in your soul that's where God dwells and he speaks to you through that soul and then if now that Soul says receive the weight and you say you still young we are grieving that person inside of you God's not going to judge you no but this man up here your intellect and he's going to judge you by your soul right amen because you failed to control your spirit now it see the Bible says in Proverbs 2528 we can read it you've got a spirit you've got your soul but you need to control your spirit you have the power to control your spirit because it's yours what does it say he that had no rule over his own spirit it's like a city that is broken down and without wall when the still Small Voice speaks to you listen to to that what makes you a Believer is that you've got the conscience and then that conscience tells you that you are denying the right of your soul listen to what uh the prophet says here he says here I'm reading this book 10 versions it's paragraph 34 he says oh no not that constant burden for the lost [Music] soul don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul [Music] hear what he says don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul no matter how bad anyone ever treats you or anything don't never don't be guilty of letting that thing anchor in your soul it will grieve the holy spirit away from you see it will grieve the Holy Spirit yeah amen paragraph 85 says amen always keep all the roots of bitterness out of you no matter what anyone does to you just have God in there that will keep all evil away from you so that is why now you have to even in in the Book of Proverbs chapter 16 verse 322 it still says that he that that rued his spirits is better than he that take it as City he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh a city amen he that ruleth his Spirit your spirit is yours you rule it now what why am I reading these things I'm sure you I'm showing you that now there there is uh a a a supernal Instinct in you right amen of which you can ignore it and when you ignore it we are grieving the Holy Spirit that's the thing that is is taking you to the quickening of your body right amen the prophet says Christ uh the word I mean Christ is the Living Word in you when you talk about Christ when he says the word is now in the bride potentially Christ is in you it's not only the we The Living Way the word is the seed the seed is got life in it now a seed that is not planted cannot germinate a seed that is planted then it need germinate it it becomes a living weight in you that's why the Bible says uh it is the spirit that Quicken it you see am the flesh profited nothing it's the words that have been spoken you will read it in j i quot it every Sunday when I John 663 John 663 the word h it's the word that the spirit it is the spirit that Quicken it the flesh profited nothing the words that I speak unto you are spirit and are life right amen now you should know which promises have been manifested in your life and which uh promises you still waiting to be manifested in your life you must write them down and say this is my promise was not manifested and this one is not manifested and this one is man look you know uh Simeon Simon was waiting for the manifestation he said I won't die until this is manifested Simon was waiting to see the Messiah was praying day and night Ana and some sisters we praying day and night go to the temple we are waiting for the day we've seen this we've seen this we've seen this dreams promises uh Visions they all been fulfill and then they would see the signs you see the time so this thing tells there's something that must happen then he said I will not die until it is manifested and then when it was manifested he picked him up and say Lord your servant can now go into holding him the pr are we together now we should know that this and this and this and what is remaining otherwise to go to the service and come back go to the it will be impossible to reach your destination because you don't read the signs that are happening around you each and everything that happens around you must have an answer are we together then you ask yourself are we together amen now in Romans chapter 8 you know it can can you read verse 23 Romans chapter 8 ver 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves am waiting for the adoption to weit the Redemption of our body okay fine uh 22 start from 22 for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in peace been together until now so it says now the whole God's creation it's groaning and travil it it's in pain God's creation when when God created it when he created his his creation it was happy it was there was no Trav there was no pain there was no sorrow right am then verse 23 says and not only they but ourself also now you must know where is your Trav where your pain it says until now right amen but not only they but ourselves also which we have the first fruit you know the first fruit of the spirit speak about love yes I have love joy peace suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience we have those but how why are we grow new because this world is not our [Music] own we are not happy yet we have all the first but we could see uh-uh something is not right even ourself grown within ourselves individually gr within ourselves waiting for what so that we should be potential God no I'm saying we are potential God when we are potential God why are we grown we are waiting for the [Music] adoption right amen adoption to be received as believer into the Heavenly F potentially we have been but still we are grown we want the full one not the potential the Redemption of our bodies yes we are potentially Gods but we want our body to be redeemed you know one day our Lord Jesus Christ said what would you see if you see the son of man Ascend to where he was before we went to go there we went to ascend to where we were before together that is why what we need is a Ministry it's a sermon that will tell us about the changing our bodies about the quickening of our bodies we have done what is good everything that is good but we know what we want right amen we know what we want he says the words that I speak to you they are spirit and they are life right amen right we are on that life let's go again uh yes I'm checking time uh let's go to First Corinthians my brother just read from verse 46 to 48 chapter 15 First Corinthians from verse 46 how be that was not first how be that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the F earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven s is the e such are they also that are earthy and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly you see that that is what the word says it says that how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that but uh that which is natural like we read uh Genesis 2:7 the body was made and then the spiritual came out you you were born out of your parents and then the supernatural came that's why you are here that's why some other people don't understand why you are here that's why some other people don't understand why do you carry your Bible and go to the service when they come over here and sit and listen they can't grasp a thing now they wonder what is wrong with me you know what the Bible said I think it's in the book of Acts 13:48 you don't have to read it it speaks about those that were ordained for eternal life says those that he knew he called them my sheep hear my voice we hear a voice that's why we follow because it's we're part of him when we receive the we we receive the part of him when it germinate within us then we become that way then he's our father that's why Jesus Christ said my father is in me that's why he says I and my father one how can you explain that not two people one and that is why the Bible says that day shall that I am in the father you in me in you that makes you potential go it makes you one now you can't explain that it comes through a revelation and if you go to the book of Jude verse six says there are those that are ordained for condemnation like Judas speak about the angels that kept not their first estate there are people that is difficult for them to keep their first estate how wonderful it is to worship [Music] God there's always joy in your heart there's always happiness in your heart there always protection in your heart you speak he answers you speak he answers without any pain but there are some people that will get into problems and waste lot of money and trying to find [Music] life right that's why there it says how be it the one that was spiritual came the second let's read the the 47 the first man is the earth an earthy the second man is the Lord From [Music] Heaven he comes through the we so now I'm reading here is this is a long one the cruel of sin and the penalty that it caused Amen to read Sin from our lives amen now he says he made him out of the Dust of the earth not his own image he started by saying let us make man in our agage after our likeness that was a man that was his son that was logos that is Christ that is why he said Christ said your father abam saw my day and was happy because before he was I was [Applause] now that's where his communication is and that's where the bride's communication is now you are in a position where when when Christ says before he was I was I am now you are in that stage you are speaking now from your position said what would you say when you see the son of man Ascend to where he was before now we're speaking about things about a place where we were before we are talking from that position while we are in this area that's that is why he would say tell no one because it's only for the Angels only for The Supernaturals only for the theop you have to be in that Dimension while you are in this Dimension are we together you speak some things that are in another dimension while you are in this Dimension but you speaking to the people that are not in this Dimension so the ministry today it's in another dimension we communicate from above so that is a pul that's the one that will P that will bring about now the quickening of [Music] are we together may the Lord bless [Applause] you oh [Music] singing
