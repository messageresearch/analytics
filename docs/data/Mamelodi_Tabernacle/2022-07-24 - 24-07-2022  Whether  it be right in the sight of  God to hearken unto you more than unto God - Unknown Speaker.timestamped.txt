[1:19:21] short birthday
[1:19:30] okay
[1:19:31] oh
[1:19:32] i'm reminded
[1:19:34] that we have opened the scripture in
[1:19:36] heaven
[1:19:40] yes sir
[1:19:41] john chapter 8 verse 22 to 23
[1:19:46] then said the jews
[1:19:48] will he kill himself because he saith
[1:19:51] whether i go he cannot come
[1:19:54] and he said unto them
[1:19:58] do you have acts chapter 4 acts chapter
[1:20:00] 4
[1:20:03] 5 to 19.
[1:20:05] i think
[1:20:08] can you run that marathon
[1:20:11] or
[1:20:16] else and it came to pass on the morrow
[1:20:20] that they are rulers and elders and
[1:20:22] scribes
[1:20:23] and anas and high priests
[1:20:25] and caiphus and john and alexander and
[1:20:28] as many as way of the kindred of the
[1:20:30] high priest were gathered together at
[1:20:33] jerusalem right
[1:20:35] are you listening
[1:20:37] who will gather together
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:58] where we have started
[1:21:01] and it came to pass on the morrow that
[1:21:04] there are rulers and elders and scribes
[1:21:07] and anas and the high priest
[1:21:10] and caiphus and john and alexandra and
[1:21:14] as many elsewhere of the kindred of the
[1:21:16] high priest
[1:21:17] were gathered together at jerusalem
[1:21:21] okay
[1:21:23] and when they had said i'll stop you
[1:21:25] somewhere just
[1:21:27] not actually stop you but
[1:21:29] carry on
[1:21:30] and when they had set them in the midst
[1:21:33] they asked
[1:21:35] by what power or by what name have he
[1:21:38] done this
[1:21:39] then peter filled with the holy ghost
[1:21:42] said unto them
[1:21:43] ye rulers of the people and elders
[1:21:46] meaning they ask whom peter peter
[1:21:49] because
[1:21:50] he has just prayed and somebody was
[1:21:53] healed
[1:21:56] and then
[1:22:01] by what power or by what name have we
[1:22:04] done this
[1:22:05] and peter filled with the holy ghost
[1:22:07] said unto them
[1:22:09] ye rulers of the people and elders of
[1:22:11] israel
[1:22:12] if we this day be examined
[1:22:16] of the good deed done to the imported
[1:22:19] men
[1:22:20] by what means he is made whole
[1:22:23] be it known unto you all and to all the
[1:22:26] people of israel that by the name of
[1:22:28] jesus christ of nazareth whom he
[1:22:31] crucified whom god raised from the dead
[1:22:34] even by him does this man stand here
[1:22:38] before you whole
[1:22:40] this is the stone which was set at not
[1:22:43] of your builders which is become the
[1:22:46] head of the corner
[1:22:48] neither is their salvation in any other
[1:22:51] for there is none other name under
[1:22:53] heaven given among men whereby we must
[1:22:57] be saved
[1:22:59] now when they saw the boldness of peter
[1:23:01] and john and perceived that they were
[1:23:04] unlearned and ignorant me
[1:23:07] they marveled and they took knowledge of
[1:23:09] them that they had been with jesus
[1:23:12] and beholding the man which was healed
[1:23:15] standing with them
[1:23:17] they could say nothing against it
[1:23:19] but when they had commanded them to go
[1:23:22] aside
[1:23:23] out of the cancer they confessed among
[1:23:26] themselves
[1:23:27] saying what shall we do this mean
[1:23:30] for the that indeed a notable miracle
[1:23:33] has been done
[1:23:35] by them is manifested to all them that
[1:23:38] dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it
[1:23:42] but that is spread no further among the
[1:23:44] people let us strictly
[1:23:47] threatened them
[1:23:48] that they speak henceforth to no men in
[1:23:51] this name
[1:23:52] and they called them and commanded them
[1:23:55] not to speak at all nor teach in the
[1:23:57] name of jesus
[1:23:59] but peter and john answered and said
[1:24:01] unto them
[1:24:02] whether it be right in the sight of god
[1:24:05] to haken unto you
[1:24:07] more than unto god
[1:24:09] judge ye
[1:24:12] let's
[1:24:13] say it in the right way whether it is
[1:24:16] right against his show
[1:24:19] whether it is right
[1:24:21] whether it is whether it be right in the
[1:24:24] sight of god
[1:24:25] to haken unto you
[1:24:28] more than unto god judge ye
[1:24:32] to waken unto you
[1:24:34] modern unto god
[1:25:06] you know the scripture
[1:25:15] yes he said you are from beneath i am
[1:25:18] from above
[1:25:23] going through that
[1:25:24] there is another scripture
[1:25:27] i'm trying
[1:25:28] to
[1:25:29] say there is another scripture
[1:25:31] 15 verse 9 to 10.
[1:25:40] mark chapter 15 verse 9 to 10
[1:25:44] but palette answered them saying we
[1:25:47] leave that i release unto you the king
[1:25:50] of the jews
[1:25:51] for he knew that the chief priest had
[1:25:54] delivered him for envy
[1:25:59] those were elders
[1:26:01] the priests
[1:26:03] those who brought jesus for to be
[1:26:06] crucified
[1:26:20] he

[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:28] [Music]
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:57] in order to kill the testimony
[1:32:02] this is what the people are trying to do
[1:32:03] even in these churches
[1:32:38] it depends
[1:33:06] uh
[1:33:19] against jesus
[1:33:49] hey zenzo 13 verse 24 paul speaking
[1:33:54] and when john had first preached before
[1:33:58] his coming the coming of the lord
[1:34:02] the baptism of repentance
[1:34:05] to all the people of israel
[1:34:08] and as john fulfilled his course
[1:34:11] he said
[1:34:13] who think ye that i am
[1:34:17] i am not here but be behold
[1:34:20] there cometh one after me the shoes of
[1:34:25] the shoes of
[1:34:27] whose feet i am not worthy to lose men
[1:34:32] and brethren
[1:34:34] children of the stock of abraham
[1:34:36] and whosoever among you
[1:34:40] feareth god
[1:34:42] do you
[1:34:43] to you is the weight of the salvation
[1:34:46] center
[1:34:47] amen for they that dwell in jerusalem is
[1:34:52] referring to the
[1:34:55] to the priest
[1:35:00] and they are rulers
[1:35:03] because they knew him
[1:35:06] not
[1:35:07] they knew not whom
[1:35:12] it is
[1:35:20] the voices of the prophets
[1:35:26] the voices
[1:35:29] they knew not the voices of the
[1:35:32] prophet
[1:35:33] prophet
[1:35:40] amen amen i i i hope you are with me
[1:35:44] here it is
[1:35:47] you know
[1:35:48] the rulers
[1:35:50] our party
[1:35:51] the preachers
[1:35:53] evangelists
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:22] he is
[1:36:35] the religious city of the world
[1:36:40] like today
[1:36:43] we are saying that city the message sent
[1:36:46] to us
[1:36:49] it's like jerusalem
[1:37:19] all the children inside now
[1:37:22] ok
[1:37:29] but i must let you know
[1:38:00] guy
[1:38:42] a man a man
[1:38:44] a man
[1:38:46] if you think you will kill children here
[1:38:48] for money you will never get that man
[1:38:50] [Applause]
[1:38:55] from the man
[1:39:10] let's you know satan is going to bend
[1:39:13] but still he is so naughty
[1:39:19] and then god
[1:39:39] that dwell at jerusalem and they are
[1:39:42] rulers because they knew him not know
[1:39:46] yet the voices of the prophets
[1:39:49] which are read every sabbath day
[1:39:53] they have fulfilled
[1:39:56] them in condemning him
[1:40:01] they will
[1:40:02] israel
[1:40:04] and they and though they found no cause
[1:40:07] of death
[1:40:09] in him
[1:40:10] yet desired the pilot
[1:40:13] that he should be slain
[1:40:29] [Music]
[1:40:33] and when they have fulfilled all that
[1:40:36] was written of him
[1:40:39] they took him down from the tree
[1:40:42] and they
[1:40:44] laid him in a sepulchre
[1:40:47] what is
[1:41:02] my brother will read it to me
[1:41:07] is that
[1:41:10] where it says
[1:41:12] that is ephesians is it chapter four
[1:41:15] conversely
[1:41:42] from verse 8.
[1:41:47] wherefore he said when he ascended up on
[1:41:50] high he led captivity captive and gave
[1:41:53] gifts unto me
[1:41:55] now that he ascended what is it but that
[1:41:58] he also descended first into the lower
[1:42:01] parts of the earth
[1:42:03] he that descended is the same also that
[1:42:06] ascended up far above all heavens that
[1:42:09] he might feel all things
[1:42:26] um
[1:42:40] m
[1:42:52] for christ also have once suffered for
[1:42:54] sin the just for the unjust that he
[1:42:57] might bring us to god
[1:42:59] being put to death in the flesh but
[1:43:02] quickened by the spirit by which also he
[1:43:05] went and preached unto the spirit in
[1:43:07] prison
[1:43:09] right
[1:43:11] put to death
[1:43:17] read again to death
[1:43:19] put to death being put to death in the
[1:43:22] flesh in the flesh
[1:43:34] when they came
[1:44:15] he said to them what google
[1:44:17] our problem is
[1:45:00] this party
[1:45:04] uh

[1:46:29] are influenced
[1:46:30] from an outside world
[1:46:37] let's continue
[1:46:50] and the right gifts
[1:46:59] dominated from
