========================================
and pray. Gracious Lord, indeed thou art precious Lord. You are the our only hope, Lord Almighty. We are together again. Father, with our heads bowed this morning, we present our souls unto thee. You being the one that has processed us, Lord, from your mind, having that knowledge and understanding, Lord, through the power and the spirit that you gave us. We are worshiping thee, Lord, from the depth of our hearts. And we know the reason why we are here Lord. The reason for our gathering here Lord Almighty is to bring glory unto thee and to hear thee answering us Lord Almighty as per promise father that you will never leave us alone. It's a promise that comes from being gracious Lord that you will always be with us. And at this moment, Father, we bring that glory unto thee. And with the bubbling of our hearts, we call upon your presence, Lord. Calling upon the powerful name of our Lord Jesus Christ, as per promise, that father, when that name is mentioned, everything's in heaven itself, Lord, even here on earth, Lord Almighty, even all the dark forces, Father, when they hear that name, they bow down, Father. We are here gracious heavenly father giving thanks unto thee Lord for being with us all these times.

Gracious Lord, thank you father for giving us these understandings and these knowledges. Lord Almighty, we commit everybody in here unto your hand.

Thank you father for we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Like to thank God for the privilege of coming into his house. Amen. When I saw my name last week that I'll be singing, it's always a task for me that I I go and search and go deep and try to find something. It is motivated by the fact that we have to bring something something that is always relevant and something that will edify. So I I personally don't take it lightly. I sometimes I search in my spirit and find that there's nothing but around Thursday somewhere there I was meditating on this scripture in numbers chapter 16 we all know the scripture where deathan and gora and all those that were with him with them trying to challenge the priesthood. But what struck me was that they they said something about Moses being holy. So when listening to he always likes to define things, put things into perspective so that you have an understanding. So I questioned, what is this holiness that this Bible is referring to? Is it just living a clean life or does it go deeper? Then quickly I was turning the pages of the Bible. I went to Ephesians chapter one where it says God has chosen us in him. before the foundation of the world that we should be holy. Hallelujah. So I said, what is this holiness? And the only answer that I could find was that that whom God has chosen, he declares him to be holy. Whether people like it or they don't like it, he has declared them to be holy. So was happy to say it has got nothing. Moses had a pending case in Egypt. He ran. But when when God and when he met God out of the burning bush, from that point on, God declares him, you are holy. So I got the answer from there to say holiness. Yes, we live right. We we try as Baba has said in his prayer that we try and do our best. But this holiness is something that God has to bring down to us so that we should live a holy life. And I said, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you. because I don't have to strive on my own. But you give me you give me something. Hallelujah. He gives us something. We look at ourselves. We look at our mistakes and say, "But Lord, am I worthy?" And he says, "Yes, you are holy because I have chosen." So coming to to the service, a song came and it says, Give me [Music] give me give [Music] Angel give [Music] me Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, give me no tand. Give [Music] me give me. [Music] Jal [Music] [Music] meal. Hallelujah. Great is your mercy towards me. All loving [Music] kindness towards me.

Amen. Today I have been requested to stand in the gap and I believe you have prayed and I also believe that the Lord will bless us and the pastor also says he will see us very soon. So we come to the pulpit with his blessings. As my elder last week indicated, we are only standing in the gap because the pullpit belongs to the pastor and we were looking at the scripture together with my brother and we confessed for these scriptures. us. The only person that can interpret them is our pastor. So may the Lord richly bless him. And I must also confess that the little thought that I have, I got inspired from a message that the pastor preached. There was a message that the pastor preached titled the condescended god. So this little thought we received it from that message that the pastor. So let us open our scriptures. Now I want us to open Revelation 3 verse 20 and also Ephesians 1:4. Let me ask our elder just to say a word of prayer. May the Lord richly bless you. Amen. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Gracious Lord, we have prayed. We have heard the testimonies. We have heard the hymns and songs. Amen. And now is a time Lord Almighty that we should know that those were just the introduction. They were just laying a foundation for your word. Now that your word is about to be announced here. Yes Lord. We have our brother here brother Mete of which we all know him as our deacon. Amen. And father we commit him unto thee that he is a man. He cannot preach to us. But you are the only one that can preach to us. But gracious heavenly father, you use a man and you use a voice of a man. Father, we surrender Lord Almighty to the one that you have elected today. Amen. To speak to us Lord Almighty. not really to him but to the voice that will be coming after that Lord. We pray that you anoint our brother Lord. Amen. And inspire him Lord. Amen. And give him faith Lord on what you have given him Lord. And open up our hearts gracious heavenly father that what what comes from his mouth should be what come from your heart father so that it should benefit us all. Gracious Lord, thank you father for we pray in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ as we are about to read the word Lord those scriptures that we're about to read. Amen. Expand them Lord Almighty. Amen. Let them bring faith in our hearts let them bring an understanding in our hearts so that at the end of this sermon father we should say thank you father you really loved us Lord. Amen. that we pray in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. Let us start with Ephesians chapter 1 verse4. According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. And let us also read the second epistle of Peter chapter 1 verse 1-4. Second Peter chapter 1 from verse 1-4. Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with with us through the righteousness of God and our savior Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ our Lord. according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and good godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by this ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And Revelation 3 20. Revelation 3:20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and will s with him and he with me. Amen. You may be seated. [Music] We want to title this message God condescending to his creation. And our text Enor. Yes. Amen. Means uh God changing his mask. So I was looking at the word condescending. So it says the conesion of God refers to God's act of voluntarily lowering himself to engage with humanity. often out of love or compassion. And we are aware of a scripture in the book of Thessalonians that says, "The Lord himself shall descend with a shout." Now descent [Music] also has similarities to condescending because descending means moving down or going from a higher place to a lower position. So that's why our title says God condescending to his creation. So I took it from the spoken word stature of a perfect man. Stature of a perfect man. Paragraph 65 says paragraph 65. What is it? God condescending to his creation. God wants to be woripped. The word God means object of worship. And is God trying to condition his people so he can get from them what he created them for? He never made you to be something else beside a son and daughter of God. If you have missed that of being a son and daughter of God, you have missed the mark. And paragraph 63 also says paragraph 63 remember God reveals himself in three ways. First time he revealed himself in a pillar of fire and that was called the fatherhood. Then that same God made manifested in Jesus Christ. So at first he revealed himself through the fatherhood. It was God above us. Then secondly, he manifested himself in Christ Jesus. He built a body came to the earth and through the death of that body he sanctified the church so that he can dwell in the church. Firstly, it was the fatherhood, God above us. Secondly, it was God with us. He came and manifested as the Lord Jesus Christ. And the Bible called him Emmanuel, God with us. But fatly it was God in us. So he condescended from the fatherhood. He was coming down. Then it was God with us. We had fellowship with him and he was crucified so that he can come back again to be God in us. So he was changing forms as he was coming. Uh let me read a quotation here. H which also blessed me where the prophet says in the book Christ is the mystery of God revealed paragraph 476 amen it says he just don't change is God in Amen. [Music] Let me start here. Says the whole thing is God. Amen. The pastor read this many times for us. Say this is God's great mystery of love express that God and man became one. So is God in man. Amen. And that's the final destination. That's his manifestation. And he says, I want you not to fail to get this. God accept nothing else but Christ in you. The hope of glory. The only thing that God recognizes is Christ in you, the hope of glory. So when God is condescending to his creation, the final destination is God in a man. Amen. Amen. Let us look at it here. I want to read uh who is this Melkisedc? Who is this Melkisedc? You know when you are sitting at the corner and looking at this you find them very easy. The problem is when you come to the Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Now we find out that this person no beginning of days or ending of days or ending of life. It was God end. Now the word enmop comes from the Greek word and it means changing himself. That means God changing his mask. And when God change his mask, he expect us to recognize him. Hallelujah. If you fail to recognize him, the prophet says you miss the mark. So when you recognize him, when he change his mark, God is pleased when when you recognize him. So he will always change his mouth. and come to us. You know there's a scripture in the book of Job. It says God visit us every morning. [Applause] So the question you must ask yourself, what did God say to me this morning? So every day when you wake up remember God visit us. So we have to recognize him and when you recognize him, God is well pleased. Amen. And it says when you recognize him you must say the right thing and and when you say the right thing it will please the Holy Ghost. So he comes to us every morning. So it says the same God was made flesh and dwelt among us. You see God changed his [Music] form and came to us. Amen. Amen. So that he could be seen. And God masked in the pillar of fire and that was the fatherhood. God must as a man called Jesus. Amen. So it was God above us, God with us. Now he conddes descended and now is God in us. Amen. Amen. He came to Abraham Abraham and Abraham recognized. He came to Abraham as a man. I love the way our pastor dramatized it. Or it was three men, dusty shoes, they walked and they ate and they were hungry. But when Abraham saw them, [Music] surely they passed other people on the road. I'm sure one of them was saying maybe one of them was saying hey this man really but when Abraham saw them he recognized him and he said my Lord not my Lord but he recognized him. And he was so pleased that Abraham recognized him and they had a fellowship. The other two they left they went to Sodom but he stayed with Abraham. the other day came to Abraham ascal others saw a man I'm sure some may have said this man is rich sawing him in camels you know but Abraham recognized him. Hallelujah. Amen. So when he change his form, we as the attributes must recognize him. Amen. Amen. Let's move forward. Unless we have a diagram here. I want us to look at it. If the brothers can display the diagram of the church ages. Amen. So he changed himself from a pillar of fire to become a man. Amen. Amen. Then he changed himself back in the spirit again that he might dwell in men. So when it was God with us, he referred to himself as the son of man. the son of man because he was a prophet. Now the prophet says, Jesus never referred to himself as son of God. He referred to himself as son of man because the scripture cannot be broken. when he was here on the earth as the son of man. The prophet says it was God acting in a man. It was God acting in a man. He just changed from the pillar of fire and then had to come in a body of a man. Hallelujah. Amen. So he never referred to himself as the son of God, but he referred to himself as son of man. [Music] Now they had to recognize him. as the son of man. Now the prophet says, "Look at that sophinician woman who ran to him and said, thou son of David, have mercy on me." He never as much raised his head because this woman was a gentile and he had no claims on him as son of David. So when this woman said son of David have mercy on me that means this woman did not recognize him. So the prophet said the Lord Jesus did not did not even raise his hand because he was not recognized. So he was not pleased that this gentile recognize him. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. But look at blind Batimus. He was a Jew. So the gentile woman had no claims on him as son of David. But blind Batimas had a claim on him as son of David. But the gentile woman had to recognize him as son of man. Now the prophet talks about sister. You have to know these words and these things. That's what the prophet says. You have to know these words. Look at her right that time when the third pool you remember of all of everything that woman said the right thing. So this woman recognized him when the third pool was revealed. You've got to say the right word, the right thing to God. So, sister said the right thing because he recognized him as the son of man. Amen. Amen. While we are still on our diagram, I also want to read few things here uh from the unveiling of God. The unveiling of God. There was this little woman also in all of her sin. The Samaritan woman, she recognized him. We know the Messiah is coming which is called the Christ. She recognized because she was a predestinated s. That's why it's very important to know who he is in your time. Now let's let's look at some of the Greek. The Greeks wanted to see him. And when Jesus was veiled, it was to do the work of redemption at the cross. So God could not die as a spirit. He had to put on a mask and come as a man and and die at the cross. Now the Greeks wanted to see him but they could not see him. They have seen the form of a man, but they did not recognize him. Here they could not see him. The Greeks wanted to see God. And there he was veiled in a man and they could not see him. But they saw the man. They could not understand how why that they could not recognize him. There stood a man. They come to see God. and they see a man. Keep in your mind, God was veiled in a manual. So they come to see God and they were convinced and they have heard about Jesus. So they come to see God but they were disappointed. They saw a man. The prophet says paragraph 101 unveiling of God. Now be real careful. He is the same yesterday and forever. God gave us a shepherd. God gave us a pastor. The word of God comes to the exact because the prophet says they will see us through. Now God predestinated our pastor to be our shepherd. Amen. And God hides and veil himself in a man now because it's the same yesterday, today. The question is when you look, what do you see? Amen. Amen. God veiled in the form of a man, hid himself from their view. They could only see a man, but those predestinated saw God. One saw a man, the other one saw God. And the prophet says both they were right. One saw a man so God. So the prophet says those that are predestinated when they looked at that man they saw God. [Applause] But those that are not predestined when they look at the man can really preach. I can really put it nicely. You preach nice. But they don't see God. So the Greeks heard about Jesus that he healed the sick, made the blind see. They saw all the miracles. So they were convinced that no man can do these things except God. He raised the dead. They said, "We want to see God. But they could not see him. And the prophet says both of them were right. One saw a man, one saw God. Hallelujah. Amen. I will pass here. Now the prophet says after his burial and resurrection he came back as the son of God. Yes. after his burial and resurrection and the prophet says it was God acting through men. So during the seven church ages it was the son of God acting through Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Then it says again, he return as son of man. So in the last days he is revealed as son of man. Amen. And remember when is revealed as son of man, it is God acting in a man. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. I also want to pass this area. Amen. Amen. I want to approach the closing. Let us look at John the Baptist. Now John the Baptist the prophet says he will never had known Jesus if it hadn't been for the Holy Ghost pointing him out. That's Christ is the mystery of God revealed faithfully 46. So for John to recognize him, the Holy Ghost had to point him out. You know, the prophet says the the Samaritan woman for him for her to recognize Jesus, it was because she was predestined. But the prophet says there was something in her to believe. Hallelujah. So something in her When that thing was activated, she recognized. So that means you must have something in you to recognize him. So John the Baptist that great prophet that came forth said there's one standing among you right now ordinary man standing here somewhere that's the lamb of God and John says I bear record I saw the spirit of God, the Holy Ghost descending from heaven like a went upon him. What was it? It was the Holy Ghost pointing him out. So that means without the Holy Ghost, John could not recognize. So the Holy Ghost pointed him out. Amen. Amen. Amen. My brother, let's go to the second diagram. I'm preparing to close. Uh we read again in the book of uh who is this MelkiseDC? Who is this Melisedc? Now it says I believe is paragraph 68 paragraph 68. You became from the attribute to the flesh. The prophet says just like Adam, we bypassed our theoph. So we read the scripture that says he chose us in him before the foundation. So the prophet says we became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted. And he says you will never be the weight unless you was a thought at the beginning. So we became from attribute to flesh and from flesh we go to the way. You know, I enjoyed that lovely voice of our pastor when he was reading a quotation. He said, "Here is the secret. [Music] The word is in the bride." Hallelujah. Amen. Now we became from the attribute to the flesh going to the way. So the prophet says you will never be the way unless you was a thought at the beginning. You know the pastor read a scripture for us uh in the book of Ecclesiastes. If we can just read that scripture chapter 3, just read it my brother from verse 14. I know that whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever. Nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it, and God doeth it that men should fear before him. That which have been is now, and that which is to be hath already been, and God requireth that which is past. You see, we we became from the attribute to the flesh. And to the fle from the flesh to the way. Now to go to the word it says it must be from the attribute because God requires that which has been. So the prophet says you will never be the way unless you was a thought at the beginning. So the only way that you can become the way is only if you were part of him is only if you were part of his thoughts. That is if you were an attribute in him then you can become. Now the prophet says and I want to read this uh it's paragraph 71. Paragraph 71. Uh, who is this Melkisedc? Who is this Melkisedc? It says, look, when this body, this is flesh. Now when this body when you are in the flesh when you receive the spirit of God the immortal life inside of you see because you became from attribute flesh there's an inside life there's not a life now it says when the Holy Spirit comes, it throws this body in subjection to God because there was an immortal life in you laying dormant. But when you receive the Holy Ghost, that immortal life is activated now. It throws this body in subjection to God because you were part of his attributes. You know in the spoken word rapture page 28 paragraph 144 page 28 paragraph 144 it says you say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that don't mean you are saved you see it says the rain falls on the just and unjust. So one can receive the baptism of the but nothing is activated because there is no immortal life laying down but another one became from the attribute to flesh and there's an immortal life when the holy ghost come it activate that immortal life And it says it throws this body in subjection. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's just read the last thing here. Amen. Amen. We are still on this diagram. Amen. Amen. I want to read uh this part that we bypassed and we shall close. It says page 20 Hebrews Hebrews. Here is what happened. And the prophet says, I just get on this. This just get me right where I love it. The logos and this great fountain. This great fountain of spirit which had no beginning or no end, this great spirit began to form in the creation and the logos that went out from it that went out from it was it was the only visible form the spirit had and it was a theophony. So the Lord Jesus Christ did not bypass this. He came as the word but with us we bypassed that visible form. So from we became from the attribute to flesh. But the Lord Jesus Christ I remember the pastor showed us in a diagrammatic form to say he became and did not bypass the theophanop but with us we became but we bypassed the theophan. so that we can be tempted. So the theophony it is the visible form of the spirit. It is the only visible form of the spirit which is a body. The body was like a man. And even Moses saw the back part of a man. And the prophet says it was the theophony of God. And the prophet says is the same type of body that we receive when we die. Amen. So the prophet says potentially let me read this because I remember read it. He was preaching about the attribute of God and the pastor also read it. Paragraph 65. Paragraph 65. When Abraham met him, he was Melisedc. And it says he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final. You see in the final end the pastor always says have you met since you believe because it unfolds what all the attributes will do in the final age. If you did not become from the attributes then you cannot meet me because all the attributes in the final end they must meet and when Abra Abraham met him he was a man he was meed. So now all the attributes that became from him in the final end they must met him. Every son of Abraham, every son of the faith absolutely do the same thing that Abraham did. May the Lord richly bless you. as we stand on our feet and just to worship the Lord as I hand over to may the Lord richly bless you. My brother, whatever song is in your heart, [Music] [Music] alone.

Every day, Lord, in our lives, while on this earth, you keep on changing us, Lord, to your very image. Father, we thank you this afternoon for the word that was delivered in this place. Since from the morning, Father, when we came here singing the songs, your children sang their hearts out. Father, you came mightily and spoke to us as it was in the beginning. Lord, in this last days, you gave us a prophet. Lord, who preached the message the unveiled God, the unveiling of God, Lord, the God who has emoted himself, who was every time changing his mark and to know which God we serve, the God who is a light, with a supernatural light, When there was nothing on this world, Father, you spoke your word and your word was the logos. Hallelujah. And your word was the spirit and there was a man that you created. That man you partnershipped him, Lord. You placed him in the garden of Eden. It was Adam himself, Lord. And you used to come and visit him. Your voice walked in the garden of Eden. Father, we are glad today you said men of old, the Job, the prophets were looking Lord for this day when the sons and sons and daughters of God are manifesting you, Lord. We thank you for the word. We thank you for the songs and we believe that word has find a dwelling place in our hearts because you saw in us that it was like you Lord in these last days. Father, we thank you for our pastor, for the prophet that you sent, for elders, preachers, Lord, who can stand and minister your word. And that word is busy every day healing us in our souls, restoring us, Lord. Finally, Lord, we thank you. We run short of words to express how we feel. We can go on and on. Father, bless the church.
