this morning lord we'd like to thank you we thank you father that we are in your present lord we are coming from different places father just to come and be addressed by thee yes and the father we know and we believe that the father surely will address us also this morning because the father we thank you for the light that lord you have given to the pride because the seven messenger lord is saying that lord yes there was a full light from the first age church but in that light lord it went lord going down it was lost because father of the teeth of the nicolaitans and the father it went down also to the second father age to the third age to the fourth age but on the fifth age it started to go up and when it went up further on the sixth edge it went even more up it went up further also in the laudician church but further all of a sudden lord it went down again amen at the moment where we are father there is darkness lord in the church but the father there is a light in your pride [Music] he said father this darkness lord it was also prophesied by the eclipse which is the seventh stage of eclipse that went totally dark in darkness further in this age he said their pope who is paul vi which the number six is the number of a man he went visited jerusalem for at all and the father it was the first time for the pope to visit and that has caused the darkness father in the church but the father we have to thank the lord that even if it is so lord thank you for the light that we have beyond the tunnel thank you father for the angel of the church lord that what you sure who is standing father behind the pulpit who is bringing that light father it can be dark to the church but father there is a light in the planet and the father will have to thank you for the word that the father is coming because the bible says jesus managed to overcome satan through the word yes because father he was so obedient to the word of his father even further at this time lord for the pride to manage to overcome the devil we need to have a word we need to be taught that with the world so that we can overcome the tougher the only thing that can overcome further development is to have a word and to be obedient into a weight amen now father we've got the servant we've got the man of god with us he's bringing that word father he's bringing that sword lord and the father we believe that lord soon and very soon father his gonna father lead us into that kingdom lord when mankind thank you will be waiting for us the king of salem father is standing behind the pulpit bless him father we know that lord is always protected we know that the father the devil father doesn't like him and we don't like you either you devil because in the name of the lord jesus the seven messenger he's saying father when we are facing you devil there is no need for fasting and prayer but is to rebuke you in the name of jesus is to tell you where to get off in the name of jesus now we are not going to stand against this weight right now in jesus mighty name bless our pastor bless the church bless the pride my father as father we go up as father you nourish our soul as father you build us inside lord for the recurring faith we bless you father as we give the glory and honor in jesus mighty name amen amen [Applause] let's go back to the word brother let us visit enoch again we'll take it from there because what happened there is happening here we started with abraham for with abraham it said as it was in the days of abraham so shall it be in our day what did it mean in the days of abraham god came to abraham as a man called amen now it says at the end of time it will repeat again but to the seed of abraham and the seed of abraham after you are through with that i will read it amen genesis chapter 5 verse 24 and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him you remember the second one amen jude verse 14 and it and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of his sayings behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their heart speeches which and god listeners have spoken against him these are mammars complainers walking after their own lust and their mouths speak of great swelling with having men's persons in admiration because of advantage you may be seated god bless you galatians chapter 3 verse 16 says now to abraham and his seed where the promises made did you hear it to abram and his seed i read where the men of god said like this that is the church ages he said we were seed in order to be born again [Music] if you know the law only you take the seed you plant it it will come forth amen and it will reproduce of its kind and then next time you'll take the seed from the seed [Music] and plant it it will continue to bring of its kind never really change for something else along the way and it will remain a seed a seed a seed a seed throughout the ages i mean because it has got life in it now that's why it says to abraham and his seed where the promise is made you know that's why today you can look around and say abraham has a seat [Applause] is the seed of abraham today amen because of his seed made the melchizedek so he said he should meet melchizedek if he is the seed of abraham amen not a churchgoer now the abraham and his seed were the promises made [Music] he said not and to to cease as of many but as one and to thy seed which is say it which is amen the seed is christ christ is the anointing that's why it says jesus the anointed jesus the christ all right now here we read of enoch the seventh man from adam that's how it is
