[24:19] himself
[24:20] and father the promise is that we will

[27:59] him
[28:00] and the prophet said he's a man of God
[28:04] the prophet said he's the highest figure
[28:08] in the apostolic father

[28:26] we'd like to thank you Father
[28:28] the power is within us
[28:31] and there is no David yet
[28:34] that has got the power over this change
[28:38] thank you Father
[28:40] may your power Reign Lord
[28:43] may your weight be revealed abundantly
