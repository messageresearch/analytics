Your hand is still like this. You just receive the healing &gt;&gt; which was there before. &gt;&gt; That's why we are singing today. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; The healing we received it. I am beyond this. &gt;&gt; Before there was any sickness, &gt;&gt; before there was any disease. destroyed before I came into this body. &gt;&gt; I was already healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are healthy.

In the name of the Lord, we live for free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we'll move over to the next item. &gt;&gt; Why are we here? &gt;&gt; So, I think many of you are wondering why are we here. &gt;&gt; So, we'll hand over to Babina to come over and tell us why are we here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those who can sit, you are welcome to sit and those who are young like myself, we can stay. Let me greet you &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The pastor normally says Those of the right hands, I believe all of them are here. Let me appreciate this moment. &gt;&gt; The opportunity that we are given here. &gt;&gt; Such a wonderful opportunity. [Music] We did not even think that we'll get this opportunity. &gt;&gt; This is our pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Where &gt;&gt; in Cape Town? &gt;&gt; I am with another elder. Brother, &gt;&gt; can you please stand? [Applause] &gt;&gt; We came all the way. We bow to the pastor here. Say pastor please lead us. &gt;&gt; A person is born is born by God &gt;&gt; so that he can take God's people back to him. &gt;&gt; So I'm here to explain why are we here. There was no way for us to appreciate the pastor. &gt;&gt; We met him in the convention. We met him in big uh services. In our heart it was something that he wanted to do but we were unable but God gave us an opportunity &gt;&gt; on his birthday. &gt;&gt; We came as the entire church from Cape Town &gt;&gt; to say thank you pastor. &gt;&gt; Happy birthday to you. &gt;&gt; Happy birthday. The book of Isaiah says a son is born. &gt;&gt; Amen. The authorities on his shoulders on his shoulders on one side as well. God gave birth. We here to give that honor. Maybe the program will continue for us to be here. We are here to celebrate with our pastor. [Applause] We didn't even take a flight. We decided to come with the cars. &gt;&gt; If we take flight, we feel like we didn't take a responsibility. We wanted to dodge the on the road so that we can come to our to shake our hands. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you. Thank you, Cape Town. &gt;&gt; We'll now move over to our next item, which is a music item by the Swilland believers. &gt;&gt; I think wherever you are, you can just start a item as as the Swan believers. &gt;&gt; I see. [Music] Oh my god. [Music] Oh my god. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh god. [Applause] [Applause] Oh, he [Applause] amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll we'll also ask our sister here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To also lead us with a song. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [Music] [Music] Down. [Music] [Music] Lord. She seems [Music] [Music] My job now my child my [Music] Amen. [Music] All right. Thank you. Thank you believers. &gt;&gt; So we are here. We are blessed. We've got pastors among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the next item on the program is to request our pastor here, pastor Miva, &gt;&gt; just to give wishes &gt;&gt; of birthday to our &gt;&gt; pastor &gt;&gt; to his daddy. &gt;&gt; So we'll hand over to you pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; English is fine. &gt;&gt; Oh, they say I must speak English. &gt;&gt; I am greeting all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We Let me just stand in front of the pastor. &gt;&gt; Be here. Amen. Uh I really appreciate the invitation that the family extended to me and say uh your your father is celebrating. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come and be part of the celebration. &gt;&gt; One thing that is difficult is that whenever the family invites me, &gt;&gt; it's difficult for me to say no. &gt;&gt; So I cancel everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And make sure that I'm I'm here. Amen. &gt;&gt; The I don't know sometimes time doesn't do justice when you want to speak about the experiences that you one has had with the pastor &gt;&gt; and you look at the sacrifices that he has made for the ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh you know there are times where I thought he he made many sacrifices for what was then called northern transval. &gt;&gt; Amen. But as you travel around the continent, you realize that you go to Malawi, &gt;&gt; they say Malawi, he was here. You go to Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe say he was here. &gt;&gt; Then you go to Botswana, they say he was here. &gt;&gt; Then you go to Zambia, they say he was here. &gt;&gt; You go to Switzerland, they say he was here. You go to Luchu, they say he was here. Amen. &gt;&gt; You go to America, they say he was here. &gt;&gt; Amen. So &gt;&gt; uh I think it's it speaks about the quality of a leader &gt;&gt; that he has been &gt;&gt; not just for the mood church. &gt;&gt; Uh for personally for me I've learned a lot. &gt;&gt; You know sometimes you learn from home &gt;&gt; but you you become very appreciative when you travel &gt;&gt; and you compare yourself with other kids. &gt;&gt; Then you realize that they don't know as much as you know. Then you realize that at home I was well raised. &gt;&gt; Not only wellised but I was well taught. &gt;&gt; You know pastor has taught me how to approach &gt;&gt; the ministry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One thing that he told me that in ministry we don't speak about money. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He often tells me says if you plant a seed orange &gt;&gt; and you water it &gt;&gt; it will bring its moment you start shouting and say where are my oranges? The problem is that the soil might be wrong or the seat might be wrong &gt;&gt; or there is no moist. &gt;&gt; So personally I I personally appreciate you as an elder and then I would not be where I am in terms of the ministry &gt;&gt; uh without your input. We spend many times in this room where you are giving advices and for that we appreciate you &gt;&gt; and I'm here on behalf of our church our family to say we we salute you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brother say in in taking sides with Jesus, he says, "Now, I think this church, if you mean when you build this church, make this like your headquarters &gt;&gt; and like brother Neville being here being like a senior elder among you and in this case, pastor being a senior elder &gt;&gt; and mommy being headquarters. &gt;&gt; We were born by Mommy Lot." &gt;&gt; Amen. Even those that may reject it, but they were born by mommy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They would have never known what the message is like unless they were taught by the elder. &gt;&gt; So you say sometimes you you get a question that you can't discuss out with your church out there. Then bring it here to brother Nevin and you all discuss it together and you can come to any decision. I'll be coming pretty soon and we'll come together with it. Then he say get training in your own groups, other ministers, men that you see that has a calling in their life for the ministry. Train them young men. Bring them in here to the elder. &gt;&gt; Uh you know the the problem today, we've got people that are ministering but we don't know who gave birth to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when they become &gt;&gt; they become we don't even know why to report. Even in the message we are beginning to have the little bushiris but here I'm I'm very proud &gt;&gt; to have come in contact with this elder. I'm very proud to have been ordained by him. He has dedicated our church. &gt;&gt; We have not dedicated our church but they build we build a new building and I was talking to the doctor say we we don't know who needs to do it. you sort out the pastor that he becomes healthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we want him to come and preach here. &gt;&gt; So we we we really salute you Muti and may God preserve you. &gt;&gt; You have taught us the seven seal of the revelation of the son of man. You have taught us about the third pool. You have taught us about God before he became God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Deep subjects that that will never leave us. And it's part of your legacy. You made things more clearer. You know, brother says after I'm gone, there are men that will come and make things clearer. &gt;&gt; And the pastor's favorite quotation is in Christ is the mystery of God revealed where he said the whole thing &gt;&gt; is about men and God becoming one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for that we have seen God in your flesh. &gt;&gt; We have seen him in your ministry. &gt;&gt; We have seen how you had such a a burden. Maybe I won't take much time. There was a time where the pastor wanted a certain old woman to be built a house &gt;&gt; and trustes were taking time and the pastor heard him. He says I will go there take my own money and build it to build it. &gt;&gt; So it tells you about somebody that has got a burden &gt;&gt; for the people. You know there are people that are just ministers and pastors but they don't have burden for the people. &gt;&gt; But this old man has got a burden. &gt;&gt; Amen. When things are not going right, he gets troubled. When people are not being taught correct, he's troubled. We just want a great privilege that I'm here. &gt;&gt; The devil fought us many times. He thought he will separate us, but we keep on coming back together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's never easy to separate a father from a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, God bless you, pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. No, thank you. Thank you for that. Then we move over to the next item which is special item by the Cape Town and Switzerland. &gt;&gt; That's what it says on the program. &gt;&gt; Cape Town and Switzerland. &gt;&gt; So over to you believers. &gt;&gt; Yes. something. &gt;&gt; No, where you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. [Music] [Applause] Fire to me. is our [Music] [Music] great [Music] [Music] praise. So great might. [Music] [Music] is all shy. [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. I believe you.

[Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we thank our believers from Cape Town and after this item I will ask Cape Town brothers to start and see. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the next on the item we'll ask our elder from Mori just to come and wish our pastor one or two few blessing words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; It is there's no mic because when I held the mic I start shaking. Amen. &gt;&gt; Shalom saints. I greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I don't know if I can take 2 hours of your time because I grew up not talking a lot but these days I don't know why when I talk I don't stop. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I thank you for the opportunity once more and uh pastor is our father mostly all of us here he married me as well is my wife when we still young so I've been with him for a long time but I didn't prepare anything I just want to brief you about something &gt;&gt; I just experience now I can say a lot But I'm just going to start by saying I was with the pastor there as the hospital. Just one thing that happened there. I'm going to introduce you to you my new name. &gt;&gt; When I was there, &gt;&gt; sister was coming from the world. He said, "Go and assist the papa is looking for prince. I don't know who's prince." &gt;&gt; Then when I get inside the where he was in the hospital, I was walking with the doctor and he said, "Yeah, this is Prince. He didn't know. I I never even told my wife. I came out of the word be Mr. Prince. &gt;&gt; So I I thank &gt;&gt; pastor for the new name you have given me. I adore it. Secondly, I was with a pastor in a lot somewhere and then we were talking and sitting down. He said, "Boo, I saw children of God rapturing Then I look at him. You were there. &gt;&gt; So those are the things that were in my heart &gt;&gt; like you are today. You know them. &gt;&gt; But he said to me, "But I'm worried I didn't see so and so. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; But I'm one of them." Mama gave me a name. He said, "Branel, today onwards, your brother growth." Because I quoted something about growth who was always next to brother Brenham say Papa God &gt;&gt; help the man of God. &gt;&gt; So I've got two names. You can choose the one. So those pastor the moment we spend together it lies. It is like my entire life. That's what happens. And from uh those that are here, those are not here, but wishing to have you to this day, we say happy birthday, pastor. May God preserve you many, many years to come because we still need your ministry. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Cape Town, can you start that song for us?

Where will I go? When I'm leaving this seal, &gt;&gt; this seven seal is for the overcomers, is for the warriors. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when moving over to the next item, which will be the the word of life by pastor Eda. But before we move over to that, sister mean can we just ask you to lead us with amen? Amen. [Music] Well, [Music] &gt;&gt; mercy. I am [Music] Great. Oh, praise you. [Music] might see my Hey, [Music] [Music] I see my ad. [Applause] [Music] [Music] I want to [Music] see [Music] is my name. We are worldwide. [Music] [Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother, can you just try to interpret it so that our believers can also grasp what we are being blessed with. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are Christ. &gt;&gt; When we call your name, all the knees bow. Amen. When I don't have the lyrics, &gt;&gt; we have the seven. &gt;&gt; Amen. pool. We have the third. &gt;&gt; When we call your name, all the knees bow the underworld. &gt;&gt; He says the whole underworld is also bowing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, believers. Hey, just an apology. We like to just make one amendment on the program. We we have our our doctor here, &gt;&gt; the doctor of the pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we would like to offer him this opportunity also for the birthday wishes &gt;&gt; to his pastor &gt;&gt; to his father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; We greet you all in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we like to greet everybody the pastors I can see pastor Eda pastor Miva our deacon marza &gt;&gt; our moma &gt;&gt; and then all those that I haven't mentioned you're also welcome &gt;&gt; but the main person that I have to welcome &gt;&gt; is our dear pastor [Applause] &gt;&gt; it's such a great date this evening I didn't expect to say anything but it will come. &gt;&gt; There's a lot that we can say but one thing that I can say is that may God grant you more. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. We still need you here. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yes. And then we still need your guidance. You know there is wisdom behind a white hair. &gt;&gt; There is a lot of years that a white hair has gone that some of us hasn't gone. &gt;&gt; So that kind of a wisdom is something that's supposed to guide us, lead us. So that is why we need you just for leadership to guide us to show us the way because they you know they say the Bible says there's no new thing under the sun. &gt;&gt; So even though we might be living in a modern society where there is modern challenges modern events we can actually go back &gt;&gt; whatever challenge you might be having we can actually go back and relate. So but if you can relate, you can come to the person and say pastor this is my situation and you can say maybe &gt;&gt; some of us were not here 1970 but you can actually say 1970 &gt;&gt; such and such happened and this is how we went through it. You see because there is wisdom behind experience. So the experience that the pastor has is the kind of experience that we can never have &gt;&gt; but we can always clean on it &gt;&gt; you know come and get something from it so that we can move forward because behind him there is a lot of guidance and wisdom that the God has given him. You know, sometimes it's it's nice to be an old person, &gt;&gt; but it's more nicer to be an old person in the Lord because when you are an old person in the Lord, you you are a dual being. &gt;&gt; I don't know what to preach, but you know there is &gt;&gt; there is duality in a human being and the best duality you can have is when it's you and God. &gt;&gt; That is the best combination that a person can have and that is what the pastor has. So that is why every time pastor we come we know that whenever we come here we might spend 3 4 hours but we know that when we go back home &gt;&gt; there is something that we have. So may the good lord bless you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank thank you. Thank you doctor. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. We we have a lot of testimony with my doctor here. &gt;&gt; Yes. But then that will be reserved for that time when it comes. &gt;&gt; Yes. So now I think we move over to the &gt;&gt; I move over to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We'll welcome our pastor here. &gt;&gt; Another son of the pastor. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. So when you when you are a father &gt;&gt; and you have son and daughters &gt;&gt; who are like this &gt;&gt; what else can you ask for? &gt;&gt; There's nothing God has given you abundantly. &gt;&gt; He has blessed you with life upon life and upon life. &gt;&gt; So with that let us just welcome the word of God with welcome. Welcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh pastor will take over &gt;&gt; then we'll take it from there. Uh sisters, can you lead us with welcome? Welcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Welcome. Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, we will come [Music] with power in [Music] Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost we welcome thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh let's pray. &gt;&gt; We heavenly father there's nothing else which we can say rather than to say thank you. uh when we ask most of the times sometimes we have some doubt but Lord you forgive us &gt;&gt; because uh when we ask we know you're here &gt;&gt; and here's a testimony that you have heard us our prayers &gt;&gt; thank you father &gt;&gt; as we are here celebrating let the holy ghost take control &gt;&gt; but from the bottom of our hearts we Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; As we committing everybody in here into thine holy hands in Jesus Christ name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh today I'll forgive you. I just want you to sit down. I'll read the word of God when you sit sitting down. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just relax. Uh um uh the problem is this that uh you know um when you when you take people uh somebody uh to be the last one to speak, you have to make sure that the one who speaking last knows how to speak. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. because now we have made these four people who are very good speakers to speak before me. Now I've got nothing to say. Uh the only thing which I can do is just to wipe my tears off my eyes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh and the Lord has done us a good thing. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; A big one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord has done us a big thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a big thing. Uh hey brother, there's nothing much I can say. Just say thank you Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh thank you Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Uh this is uh we we asked and he he has he listens. M &gt;&gt; so but um uh the scripture which I'm very interested in is uh uh when I was pastor one day we have been we had been discussing scriptures according to the things which were happening in Malawi there. So we discussed we discussed we discussed uh So he said, "Ah, you you must be my friend." I said, "Oh, okay. That's fine, pastor. As long as you stand with the word, I'll stand with you." &gt;&gt; So one day says, one day after we had already become friends like that, he says, "Ah, what you I should take you and introduce you to pastor Kodima." &gt;&gt; That was 2014. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's when he took me to this very same house here uh to introduce me to pastor Kodima. Uh that was not my first time uh I saw pastor Kodima. &gt;&gt; No no no no no that's not whenever pastor Kodima comes to Malawi I don't know what was happening. The pastor would ask me to drive him around. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, he has got a very special memory. &gt;&gt; Too special. The memory is so good. So good. So good. I was driving him around 2009. Yeah. 2009 2010. Um uh in my house the doctrine is this that uh regardless of whatever is happening in other churches what other pastors are doing I don't want my children to know but I want my children to recite the the the scriptures of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So when my boys were very very young &gt;&gt; so they were riding with pastor Kodima in the back was in the front and then they suddenly deciding hey dad. Yeah. The version 107 no that was long time ago. So after five or six years I met him says isn't you the brother who was carrying me and your children were reciting the scriptures. Yes that was me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that was a very crispy memory because it was only that time which I had carried him around. &gt;&gt; Uh but he was able to remember that thing which was very very close to me &gt;&gt; and uh I said h this man has got a special memory because anybody else wouldn't have remembered that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Jeremiah says Jeremiah 3:15 says um I will give you pastors &gt;&gt; according to my heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Um, so when I I met Pastor Kodima, uh, I heard the rumors there in Malawi. Ah, no, Pastor Kima just preaches the same thing all the time. Preaches the same thing all the time. I said, okay, that's fine. Let me go and listen. &gt;&gt; Only that to to see that their understanding is not there. Every time pastor Kim preaches doesn't preach the same thing. &gt;&gt; Even if he leads the same sentence, &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; Come and just come and listen again. &gt;&gt; He doesn't preach the same thing. &gt;&gt; He will take you the same book &gt;&gt; again and again and again on the same on the same thing. &gt;&gt; You find that it's certain dimension. [Music] Mhm. &gt;&gt; That's why Jeremiah says &gt;&gt; it's not only preaching the word, &gt;&gt; there has to be understanding. &gt;&gt; There has to be understanding because remember they had followed him &gt;&gt; for three and a half years. But their eyes of understanding were not opened until the book of acts when he opened he their understanding. &gt;&gt; But they should understand the scriptures. &gt;&gt; So quoting quoting the scriptures is fine &gt;&gt; but understanding the scriptures is another level. &gt;&gt; That one you have to get it from &gt;&gt; you're according to Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; Where are you going to get it from? Awesome. &gt;&gt; You can leave the message, you can read the scriptures, you can quote, you can preach. But Jeremiah says, "I'll give you pastors accord &gt;&gt; shall feed you with knowledge and &gt;&gt; understanding." &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we come to this level of ministry &gt;&gt; where there has to be understanding that's where a lot of us are going to fail &gt;&gt; because that's where people try to emphasize on the minor you know Uh I I know you know this the when we uh oh I don't know how many of you know classical music. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So we say this is a shyikoski &gt;&gt; uh over 18 1812 1812 &gt;&gt; in D minor. &gt;&gt; Okay. So everyone understands what it is. So there is a D minor, there is also a major. &gt;&gt; So now the problem is this. &gt;&gt; If you don't have the understanding of the scripture, &gt;&gt; you will see most of times you are so struck on the minor instead of missing the major. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The major The major is all of us to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To be like &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; So if I say I am Jesus, &gt;&gt; am I wrong? No, no. &gt;&gt; Ah, you see &gt;&gt; if people want want to see Jesus in the wrong way, where where should they go? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They should come to my house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; If you want to see Jesus, where where should they go? To heaven. &gt;&gt; No. Hh. If people want to see Jesus, &gt;&gt; where should they go? &gt;&gt; They should come to my house to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; For Jesus is me. &gt;&gt; I am &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If people wants to see me, &gt;&gt; where they should where they should go? &gt;&gt; Meisedc was soil turned into a man. go and says he picked up soil &gt;&gt; and he went into &gt;&gt; stepped into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you want to see me today, you go to heaven. &gt;&gt; It is here. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So pastors after our our knowledge and understanding, &gt;&gt; that's where the uh issue is. Uh I'm telling you the truth, church, love your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh sometimes when you preach the message and um uh I wanted to say something but let me stop you there. But uh your pastor can teach you very big things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very big things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, if you don't want to listen to this one, just close your your um, pastor when he wakes up in the morning, he doesn't make he doesn't leave his bed un &gt;&gt; even in the hotel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even in the hotel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I never did that. But nowadays, isn't it, Mom? The cleanest toilet in my house is mine, isn't it? I took it very, very well. But I took it after. That's right. &gt;&gt; In my house, the cleanest toilet is mine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I took it after what I saw this man doing. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. That's right. My wife was were wondering you have made your bed to death. I didn't tell her what you made your bed today. I didn't know. Tell her you know these things they look simple. &gt;&gt; They look simple. Uh we I have learned a lot. &gt;&gt; I would have said something but if I had said I say it a meeting like this it will cause quite a lot of political problems. &gt;&gt; But this man You are sitting here. I'm telling the truth. I have seen men leaving the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; This man &gt;&gt; lives the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we wanted to see Jesus, the Greeks wanted to see Jesus, &gt;&gt; Abraham says, &gt;&gt; but they were disappointed. &gt;&gt; They made a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We would see Jesus. &gt;&gt; So they came say this is Jesus. And he says except a seed if a seed abideth alone, if a seat is put in the storage, it abideth alone. But when it falls into the graft, &gt;&gt; it comes out as many. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when the Greeks were so disappointed that when they wanted they wanted to see a God &gt;&gt; but they saw a man &gt;&gt; because God is in a &gt;&gt; hallelujah. So we thank God for pastor &gt;&gt; uh as for me literally personally &gt;&gt; physically spiritually financially &gt;&gt; I have benefited from this me &gt;&gt; amen. God should bless our pastor. Yeah, &gt;&gt; a man. &gt;&gt; H &gt;&gt; I don't want to say much more because if I go beyond where I am, the other part will be more like political. &gt;&gt; But uh what I what I want to say uh ladies and gentlemen which we are in here &gt;&gt; we have I have seen a man &gt;&gt; living the not preaching but living &gt;&gt; the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I'll say another testimony. One day uh he was going for surgery sometime back. So So we we we arrived at the hospital. We arrive at the hospital. So the pastor had packed his uh his belongings in a big suitcase. &gt;&gt; So we arrive at the hospital. So says, "Ah, brother, you need to go and run and buy some clothes for the pastor to to wear." I said, "What about the own message books in the It was a big &gt;&gt; Okay. Isn't it my brother? We thought he had packed clothes. &gt;&gt; The only thing she had packed in this big it was like this big. They were all messy books. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the pastor was coming here to read or to the hospital. &gt;&gt; So and I I learned a lot that day. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we start running around looking for clothes. &gt;&gt; So the pastor because everybody had assumed that the suitcase which he had packed &gt;&gt; he had packed his clothes not knowing that there was only message books which you were taking. It was a big big &gt;&gt; I was big when we open when they open. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Message books. No clos. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

There was a time he killed Golath. &gt;&gt; There was a time when he killed the bear. &gt;&gt; There was a time when he killed the lion. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe in the ministry of pastor. &gt;&gt; There is time where he overcame. &gt;&gt; And Lord, right now he can remember those time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he started when there was nothing &gt;&gt; and he preached the gospel, &gt;&gt; he was on a bus moving distances, no resources whatsoever. &gt;&gt; But yet he had the zeal &gt;&gt; that the message must reach every corner. &gt;&gt; And Lord, the message has reached every corner. Yes. &gt;&gt; We want to appreciate him as an elder. &gt;&gt; May you, dear God, enlarge &gt;&gt; the days of his life. &gt;&gt; I remember dear God, when Sister Weber &gt;&gt; was told that she was going to die, &gt;&gt; and later on they were talking bad about the prophet. &gt;&gt; And sister Weber said, "You can't talk about the man of God like that." Amen. &gt;&gt; And right there, the angel of the Lord told brother &gt;&gt; and say, "You go and tell sister, &gt;&gt; I know what she said. &gt;&gt; When she stood for you, &gt;&gt; she stood for me." &gt;&gt; Tell her that she won't die. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She will live again. &gt;&gt; And dear God, even now, &gt;&gt; he is our elder. &gt;&gt; The devil has tried so many things, so ill health, so many challenges. Hallelujah. But we lift him up in prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; And give him the strength, dear God, &gt;&gt; to keep on leading your assembly. &gt;&gt; And even now, we under the authority of the word of God. &gt;&gt; As Hezekiah once said, it increase the days of my life. We can say, increase the days of pastor Gurima's life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That dear God, may he be of profit to the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; We want to commit the family, &gt;&gt; the student behind him. &gt;&gt; We want to commit his wife. She was there every step of the way. He knew what he went through. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And for that we want to appreciate them, dear God. And we pronounce a special blessing upon them as the amateur gods. We pronounce a special blessing upon the ministry. We pronounce special blessing upon them. Whatever Satan would want to do in the name of Jesus Christ, we abort every plan of the devil and make the pastor to be victorious. &gt;&gt; All these things we ask them in the name of Jesus Christ.
