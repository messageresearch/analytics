========================================
And some people are still standing there listening to the thunders. And he's gone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he left the place &gt;&gt; coming down through a god of honor time. But you read chapter 5, Revelation, shouting, waiting, singing a new song. Holy, holy, holy. Amen. &gt;&gt; As he was coming down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To give it to &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; H the thing is &gt;&gt; Yeah. He has trouble now here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let's look at this. &gt;&gt; I'll start here. &gt;&gt; Watch the title deed of redemption. &gt;&gt; All creation book belong to Adam. Adam had the book. When he fored the it went back to the original owner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God gave Adam the book, the manual book. Every time you buy a car, you get that manual book. When he dropped the book, when he dropped the book, God took it back again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then now he says &gt;&gt; the title deed of redemption of all creation was in his hand. Now he has come to claim it back for the human race. &gt;&gt; Not claim it back to the angels. to the angels, claim it back to the human which it was given to Adam to make sons and daughters of God again. Bring it back to the Garden of Eden again. Everything that I'm reading here now, Amen. That is page 103 and &gt;&gt; 111 says talk about jubilee. &gt;&gt; Talk about time when the lamp walked forth and the book sealed in heaven and the prophet says your name being sealed there. Your name is been there on the throne. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says when the seals are opened when the seals the book is revealed you are revealed with the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. the books in heaven, &gt;&gt; the mystery and John and the prophet says is my name there on the book of in the book before the foundation of the earth. Now the first thing that represented that redemption was the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world. He took the book, opened the book, tore off the seal, and sent it down to the earth &gt;&gt; to his seventh angel. When &gt;&gt; when were the seals open? Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This happened that time. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Maybe if we don't see this thing here. &gt;&gt; The lamp took the book, &gt;&gt; tore off the sin. We see in Revelation 10, he has the book in his hand coming down and John was about to write. He said, "Don't write for the book belong to the seventh angel. Amen. &gt;&gt; The book belonged to the seventh angel messenger. God bless you. That's why the prophet says, &gt;&gt; we read this thing time and again all the mysteries of God should be made known in that Elijah. So they said to John, "Not right." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not your ministry. When the seventh angel message page 29, the unveiling of God, all the mysteries of God made known in that in the last hour. This is the last hour. How that Christ is put out of his church. is revealed again as the son of man again. Oh, we can go on and on and on. What did he say? &gt;&gt; Uh when God, let me leave it there a while. &gt;&gt; He opened a book, &gt;&gt; he did that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I can say to you, the Lord is going to open the book deceiving you. But the the lamb opened the book. The lamb the lamb opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down. how he came and brother 26 souls in prison says exactly &gt;&gt; when he set one foot on the sea one on the land the seventh angel messenger was there right amen let me let us drive it a When the Lord Messiah came for was there now this time it's not John's time John's time he came as a in the form of a man a different person from John he introduced him but This time he came in like brother Brenham says the Lord &gt;&gt; took that book out of himself. Amen. So that time &gt;&gt; it was the Messiah coming to Jesus. This time the coming is a different thing. He came to the prophet and the prophet said, "The lamp is standing here to open the seals." But you could not see any number. Amen. &gt;&gt; He revealed the seals through the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought us the seals. He gave them after opening. He brought them down to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; can we spend 15 minutes? &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God will help us to keep time. &gt;&gt; Now, that's how he did it. &gt;&gt; We tried it even last time. Now the prophet says Moses and Elijah discovered the sixth seales the six. So the sixth seal and the seven seal Jewish gentile. So the same way it happened with the Jewish people, the same way it happened with the gentile people. Amen. &gt;&gt; H the prophet says &gt;&gt; this Elijah and Moses &gt;&gt; they were that mystery of the six. &gt;&gt; So the seventh seal mystery of the seven se is the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we are talking of the gods here. He opened the seal and send it to the other side of the contract other side of the contract receive the seal and open the seal to the Now let's read. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If if they can miss this, &gt;&gt; it will never repeat. &gt;&gt; You get what I mean? It will never the Lord won't come and open the seals again. If in the world they can miss this, it will never repeat. He came open the seals. Revelation 10. He came down to the David to the angel messenger. &gt;&gt; The the prophet calls it the that book the he says Adam forfeaded the book with the requirements of redemption. Now a redeemed person &gt;&gt; has a book. &gt;&gt; Uh you buy a house, you get what? &gt;&gt; You buy a house, &gt;&gt; you get a title deed. Now tit means it's your house. &gt;&gt; You get what I mean? Amen. That's why if you buy through a bond, the bank is the title deed, the house is not yet. So all this time, God had the title deed because we were still going through the payment. Amen. &gt;&gt; But at the end of the payment, hands over. Amen. That means now to claim now. That means now this redemption is yours now. The seals are yours. And here's the book to the seventh angel messenger. Here's the book. And the angel came back and he here is the seals. Because Adam was supposed to open the when he failed to redeem man worthy. No one was worthy. take the book and open the seals and he made men worthy. Do you see what a great time? If only the people could see it. &gt;&gt; I saw seven angels in the form of a pyramid. and picked me up and I was brought east to open the seven says when the seven angels came and made a formed a pyramid &gt;&gt; and he was in the midst in the middle of the pyramid pyramid. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now in the pyramid was a white stone. This white stone was a mystery, a secret. Now we see here the angels coming and brother was looking at one of the angels. He calls that angel the seventh. &gt;&gt; Can you see the twin be? Amen. He called that angel. &gt;&gt; The seventh angel &gt;&gt; called that angel the seventh angel. It's in your book in your books. If you have the title so your title deed says the lamp opened the seals is past tense. Then after he open it down with the book now opened the seventh angel messenger it was a sword in his hand and he came from the west came to reveal them to the church now &gt;&gt; they come from heaven &gt;&gt; to the transmitter people from heaven &gt;&gt; to Moses &gt;&gt; to Israel. &gt;&gt; God delivered them. &gt;&gt; Moses delivered them. &gt;&gt; God delivered them. &gt;&gt; Moses delivered them. It says Moses was Christ. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for something here. &gt;&gt; Moses was page 21. The unveiling of God. &gt;&gt; Moses had the word. After the word was manifested, this was Moses again. But while that word was in him to be given out, he was God because that word is God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Page 21, the unveiling of God. As long as the word was in Moses, he was God. He wasn't Moses anymore. &gt;&gt; He had the word of the Lord for that age. &gt;&gt; As long as he had that word, he was God. Nothing could touch him. &gt;&gt; For God, that word is God. That's that's why the people miss God so much. They don't know where he is. The prophet says today in his bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; So much that each and every one of us is a container. The prophet says you can impart life on the others. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can save. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can bless. &gt;&gt; Right. You can say it. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to read you something. &gt;&gt; God bless you, dear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why he says we are not beings of time. &gt;&gt; Now look at this God. Now &gt;&gt; Adam was the God of this. So that means God has to restore that again. He will start first with one man as God was represented in a man says in the at the last day repeat again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh, you read page 74 of seals. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for keeping you seals. &gt;&gt; John was given a message. The same time that the Messiah would come, John knew he would see him because he was going to introduce him. A forunner has to wait until he sees him for he can't introduce a spirit to the people him at this time. God introduced himself in the form of a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Elohim came at bread. He ate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we ate bread with brother. But knowing that, knowing that &gt;&gt; behind this skin, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; because the prophet says, &gt;&gt; "Oh, we can read on and on." &gt;&gt; Amen. But he says, "And now the glory of God today is behind your skin." Now that's why it's called the backside ministry from behind the skin to behind the skin. What was on the inside of that skin back there? &gt;&gt; What was behind that skin and the is Israel had to come. The prophet says they knew that behind this he is there. Now book 20 mighty God unveiled before us. God is veiled in his church &gt;&gt; in skin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He hid now from from the unbeliever &gt;&gt; and reveal to the believers. God tonight in his church, veiled in his church with a skin on &gt;&gt; still the same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Behind the skin. But while they were eating natural food, Adam knew that behind this is Elohim. &gt;&gt; But to the naked eye is a man. Elohim was represented. &gt;&gt; A human form. And that human form was a man in the house of he ate. &gt;&gt; Then he did the same thing in the last day behind the skin. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. an uneducated man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now remember, he's not just beyond behind every skin you see. As I say, sometimes there'll be a marriage, they will slaughter and hang a skin there. Now, don't think that God is behind that skin. &gt;&gt; But the predestinated as he says something here predestinated when he is behind this because there is a pool, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They know when it is not a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Behind the skin. That's why he says now talking about angelic beings angelic being associate together. Amen. We we can only meet together from inside. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe the same thing I believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope you get it. &gt;&gt; That just dropped right down here. &gt;&gt; You see the word dropped down right there. &gt;&gt; If you've got the Holy Spirit in you, then you are a candidate for association in the unseen world supernatural. No wonder people can't believe in these things. They've never come in contact. They've got nothing in here to be. But when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart of you, quickly you become a twofold being. One of the earth, one of heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One one body subject to death. But in your soul, your soul has passed from death until amen. Amen. In his body, as a believer, you have an earthly contact. five senses &gt;&gt; but in another it's another contact. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now if the message I'm preaching is from the soul we can grasp it not from the mind. Let's finish with this. &gt;&gt; The seals were open. Then he took the book back to the angel messenger came and say I was picked up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I will repeat to you that some people think the jackets were flying &gt;&gt; ejected from the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No. He says &gt;&gt; one of the lights you see will pick you up. &gt;&gt; To pick you up means he will you will become that light. That light is part of is your celestial part. in the rapture. It will be so in a twinkling of an eye that that light will pick you up and automatically you'll just change. Amen. And you'll be in another dimension. Then you can see Abraham and Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It will pick you up. &gt;&gt; When the prophet was picked up, &gt;&gt; he saw the seven seals &gt;&gt; and all that the Lord revealed to him. When I was brought east, some people think it's a dream or vision thing how he was picked up. God picked up. He became part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When these angels were coming. &gt;&gt; Now the people say they they've got wings, brother. They've got wings. I don't care whether my theopan has got wings. &gt;&gt; What I know is in the day of the rapture, &gt;&gt; it will come in and I will just fly away. Now if you see it with wings there, &gt;&gt; you know that is the old and the new testament. But today it is the Bible, &gt;&gt; the seven, the New Testament &gt;&gt; and the seven seals, the seventh, &gt;&gt; the New Testament, &gt;&gt; and the seven seals, &gt;&gt; two books. one book. Yes. Two brother is one says it's one but two. Now in those days it was the old and the new testament the day of John but in our day is the new testament and the seven seals. &gt;&gt; So they will cause me to So the New Testament &gt;&gt; seven seals my wings. &gt;&gt; So one day I'm just going to fly out of this New Testament and the seven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we need some dynamics to carry us out. I saw seven angels swept down and pick me up. &gt;&gt; Now you go and look for it. through theophan you know like the the magis how they were picked up from their place to follow now that doesn't mean so much that they were looking amen they knew where they were going because they were in orbit When that star left, they still continued. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They still continued &gt;&gt; until they went into the temple. And because they were in the temple, they lost the sight of the star. Then they went out and the star was back again. Amen. to show them the way. The star only showed them which way. It doesn't mean they were going like this. They saw it. He showed them the way. Brother Brenham came as the star of the show as the way and God took him away, &gt;&gt; but we are still on the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are still on the right track because &gt;&gt; it was programmed in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we can say to you didn't mean this. Amen. So what happened? &gt;&gt; God did this &gt;&gt; five minutes the streak seventh man. God through the seventh man &gt;&gt; the gap &gt;&gt; and they still waiting for all the people come in. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the prophet says one man first he will take the position others will come. Now what God did is we won't read now after he left the sanctuary. The prophet says so he left the sanctuary all this time while he was working on that streak as the as the mediator. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when the seals were open when he took the book, he left the sanctuary. &gt;&gt; Now one brother says, "You mean the people are are not saved?" No. The prophet I I I don't mean that says &gt;&gt; he took the book now to claim what he redeemed. Now the people that are coming in and we are baptizing claimed that's why they come and say what was this message all this time amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; They are being claimed. God redeemed them before the foundation now. They are still coming. The prophet says their name took the book, a certificate for claiming. Amen. Now &gt;&gt; he has come only with the book to claim no more to redeem redeemed. Now let's go home. Let's go to our homes and go home knowing that the Lord has redeemed. Now he has come to claim. When the seals were opened, some were not even born, but they were redeemed in 1963. Some were not born. We are here. We are here. Is that right? They were already in the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So today some of them they went that way. Some they were drunkards. Amen. Amen. But then a brother will just walk to them and say and they come because they hear their names claiming time to claim. All right. Amen. Now we are associates. Here is here is here. Allow me to close with this. Now, now we can read on and on, &gt;&gt; but this we can manage. Page 83, &gt;&gt; 83. &gt;&gt; We'll read at home. &gt;&gt; We just keep it. &gt;&gt; Now, the for fated title, page 86. Yeah. page 86. &gt;&gt; The for title deed is now in the hands of the original owner after the fall. Now I don't believe that if I've got it today say the book is in the hands of that means I don't have it. But now after I have received it, no longer in the hands of the it is in my hands. So I can't repeat and say hands of we say if you don't know what ad adoption is needs to be adopted then you'll keep on saying adoption comes amen if you tell somebody to wait for a bus &gt;&gt; and he doesn't know what a bus looks like. He'll be waiting there with his luggage the whole day. Bus is going to and fro saying the message say I must wait for the bus. the people Jesus is coming and the prophet says he came here they didn't know the only thing you are waiting now is for him to come in his corporal voice we'll meet him in the rapture so we are not waiting for the coming of the Lord actually we are not we were not through with this message the the what and the what? The appearing and the coming. We still need to to look at that subject something. So he says he he's been appearing to us again. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he came. &gt;&gt; But let's leave it there for a while. &gt;&gt; Let's leave it there. Amen. Now, page 74. You read it at home again. &gt;&gt; Page 74. John was to introduce him. So, he was supposed to see him. The prophet says just like John there's one in this end time. So he says here comes the angel from heaven another one on earth. So they made. Now you know when there is an eclipse people are advised to put on the &gt;&gt; because they will get blinded. Now if God and men meet like this in line people So the people don't see what what's going on. When the the seal was opened, the servants planted the people and in heaven stop their hs. Everything stopped there because now the almighty was now taking another position. Now when the lamp left the place coming down with the book. Eventually, he had to take the messenger away. &gt;&gt; And the messenger said, "Let him increase and let me decrease." Amen. &gt;&gt; He left the sanctuary away the messenger &gt;&gt; and he says &gt;&gt; now only the father. &gt;&gt; Who can say amen to that? Amen. &gt;&gt; As long as the street was was open. And the man was not yet restored. What happened? Mediator. Amen. Amen. Now today he left that place and after he left the place he removed the messenger. That means &gt;&gt; no mediator. Amen. &gt;&gt; Messenger being removed. &gt;&gt; That is now the father and the subject. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The father reappears after the messenger. &gt;&gt; The mediator is removed. Then is back to the father and his son. I am his son. Now you are Let's stand up. &gt;&gt; Uh we will take the second part next time. &gt;&gt; The gods, the inheritance of the gods. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just close our eyes. going to ask again our pastor here to bless the pastors and so forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shalom.
