Description:
Title: The End of the Seventh Seal Vol 3.
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 
19-01-2025 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

Revelation 8:1 | Genesis 1: 26 - 27

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the end of the seventh Seal.

The prophet is talking about the end of the seventh seal not about the revealing of it.

The church came into view once. But the Bride came in twice. The person who comes to church a year or three years and later vanishes is because he couldn’t come into the second.

There is just what is called the message of the hour where everyone can claim to be part, but people there not knowing about the reviewing the second time.

The bride was reviewed the second time; it shows that it is not new members. Something that God was not pleased with, he will never return it. God loves the bride so much and trust her so much that he reviews her the second time. Because she is still the same one who please him back there.

The bride is not confused about the seventh seal. God started to create with little things, but the greater part of his mind is that he was coming to his image. and the bible says we shall see him as he is. It doesn't say we shall see his church, but we shall see him.

The person who shall see him as he is, is the person who saw him. God will always stop when he sees himself in you. We were looking for him, and he let us to somebody in his image. The first bible was zodiac and the second was the pyramid and the third is the one in a book form.

The seventh seals close the new testament. When God closes the new testament he himself will be talking to you. If you honour God, God will speak through you. Even things you didn't hear God's hearing will work through you. If you don't know it but God knows it. If you are his child, he will answer in you. the things you don't know he will tell you. 

When he closes the new testament is not for us to stop reading or believing it. It means that he...

waiting hallelujah hallelujah God bless you D just come a God bless you amen amen uh good good morning Saints thank you for the opportunity once again while we are still waiting for the pastor just stand in this Gap here okay the pastor always says that the testimonies they edify amen amen they edify in this sense that maybe somebody might be taking the issue of uh repentance and worshiping God for granted like I I've said that when I was not a worshipper I was definitely sure that I'm [Music] right that now whoever want to worship God it's up to him and whoever doesn't want to worship God it's also up to him so it's not the same it isn't like that God created heaven and earth and everybody obliged must worship God and and if you don't worship God you definitely going to hell and in head there's no turning back your uncle won't be there your father won't be there your loved ones won't be there it will be you and the Bible says you will be there forever and ever now forever and ever it could be billions and billions of years okay fine last time uh [Music] I I stopped when the pastor arrived and even today please make me aware I don't want to take okay I said last time God sent a man I was still a young man to come and testify to me it was a strange man because during that time there were these fightings against blacks and white here in South Africa you couldn't get a white man that will drive all the way right into the center of mamod all by himself so now when I was in the bottomless pit uh begging and crying and doing all then I was told that I was given a chance and the chance that I was given was that now a I'm sorry oh yeah maybe it's Aquas want to what you call got a message I'm just saying to so I was given uh no this man I mean I said no because uh I didn't know these things and I was ignorant on that and I was not given a chance this seems to be unfair I was not aware that there's God I was not even aware that there's a devil actually I was not aware what type of life should I live because when you grow out when you grow out you just take anything the people are doing you follow friends you follow families you follow neighbors you follow whoever right then it was said okay F but you send somebody and many times and you rejected so the only place for you is this one and when it says is this one and then when that voice speak everything stands still even the torment stand still you could wish you could keep on talking but when he says now this is the only place for you then you had to go back to that so then you fall again you get into that torment of which you cannot describe it now some of the things the Bible says they are definitely true when the pastor always stands here and says may to those that will miss the Rapture it's not a joke when it says the fire is coming it's not an ordinary fire that you [Music] seen uh when your soul is tormented it's not like when your body is tormented it's two different torments remember when your soul is in [Music] torment like that rich man who was in torment who said to Abraham send Lazarus just to get a tip water just to quench my tongue the true thing okay fine it went on and then I kept on begging and then communicating with that voice until uh I I until I I just woke up I find uh there was a white sheet covered C in me the one that they use after you you're dead they cover you with a certain material called k or something so I was once covered with that so it was ready to be taken to Mo in the fridge I I wouldn't be standing here today so now I was a young man I was not married then never read the Bible in my life and then so was offered the Bible I mean I told the my coworker who was a message believer Solana like I said he gave me the St of a perfect man I went through each then he gave me the other one what's that one remind me demonology then I went through it then I saw that yes there's some parts which I was in that I see in this demonology then there thereafter he invited me to the service service the service was somewhere in a classroom I think in lady I went there uh there were very few then the pastors was preaching so now it was the first time in my life that I could hear a man speaking like that we we grew up being argument and myself I didn't want to speak P or or whatever it speaking Zulu only I thought that the only people in South Africa zul because my mother was a Zulu so when I arrived here in prioria I find people speaking a funny language then I was in M high school and then they ill treated me so I started hating uh PES now on that day when the pastor was preaching was preaching in b but there was such love that I saw there that pulled me I couldn't understand what he was saying but they could grasp what he was saying that's how now I was taken to be baptized here River so I was baptized there in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen but then I was the only one that was dressed in a funny way when I look at the other people they are not dressed like myself M knows about it how did I look that thing I think M was the only young lady in that church but what I want to say is that now the pastor pulled me towards himself and then I would ask questions then he will answer me me so he took me wherever he goes went around until I knew that nationality means nothing so I Started Loving everybody but I said the day I came to the service all my attack was a stolen one there was not even a single one that I bought so we live that life uh and I had a car that car was bought only to go to sh beans and go and drink so that at night they must not molest me on my way back then it was converted to uh the work of God amen amen so uh I was not married by then then the ad the pastor advised me to get married and there were no sisters in our assembly it was sister alone very few and because my relatives refused that I should marry in a a Christian way they said I must first go to the Mountain School I refused then they said we are not going to get you that woman you want and the Pastor said come so he's the one that took me to to get me this wife that's why that's why the two of us will never depart from the pastor they they can go if they want [Applause] to we know where we come from can go I will stick to [Music] amen because not that I love a man but I've seen the word amen during my youth time there was this argument about the Thunders some says Thunders are the virtues so we were uh nicknamed that we uh don't we don't believe in Thunders like right now we are nicknamed that we are preaching uh Under World now the pastor would explain everything about the Thunders that they carrier they carry the voice what is important it's not the Thunder themselves The Voice what was uttered now that I'm making this testimony so that the young ones should be encouraged that I was not married by then when I was young my uncle took me to in D5 and then that that said to me you will never get married you're going to suffer the rest of your life you will never have a child then in respect but I said not me then my uncle chased me out of that now I'm looking for that I'm married I've got a wife I've got five children amen I'm happy in the word yeah so Believers it is true there is a bottomless pit but now when you die I don't know there there there are lot of levels in Hell there's where the devil is that's where his angels are that's where the demons are that's where the lost souls are there's lot of punishment there if there was one who was once a Wich will bear me out that there's lot of yeah and even the pain that is there it's not a physical pain no it's a pain that you cannot describe we don't worship God because we are afraid of that pain we worship God because that is our nature now if there is one that says there is no God you must ask me I grew out here in I was we together I was well known here in m but God touched me and then there was no turning back friends came you see when when when when you are when God calls you there be lot of Temptation some will come with whiskies with cigarettes with beautiful girls trying to entice me but I just said it's over I've seen the Lord and I'm taking that step I follow that step I will follow it until Rapture comes if it's a time that I should leave before Rapture so be it but the where I am now this man that used to stand behind the pull pit our pastor they can name it the way they want to I know him better amen when the Bible says he will see you through he has seen me through amen I'm not a man worshiper I worship the word I always say Pastor if you can preach any other thing then what you are preaching now I'll take my jacket but I wouldn't know where to go because I I you are the one that showed me the truth through his mercy so now if there are church goers here be serious if there are people that just comes to the come to the service because you are forced by your parents they are doing a good thing don't ever ever lose that Vision yeah amen that that that is the long and short of my testimony that was in 19777 in October I was 30 years of age like I said now so what I am saying to you it's a season thing I'm an old man I only speak just things that are not seasoned I have been trained trained in the word I've been tested in the way so I am seasoned that's why you call

space of half an hour amen okay then let's go to where it says uh let us make men in our okay amen Genesis 1 verse 26 amen and God said let us make men in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth am so God created men in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them God bless you H I'm going to keep tight amen amen all right you may take your seats I was watching from home there do you know since ever I sh I've never missed even one service even the during the time when we you thought that I was in bed I've never missed I had this with me where the Prophet have you seen things have been manifested uh we have recorded some of them and said the prophet has spoken it is appearing even on TV showing that the prophet has spoken he really cried bitterly for uh California California all right amen amen now I was while coming I was I had this with me the end of the seventh seal while some people are still struggling to tell whether the seventh SE is what is revealed or not [Music] but the bride of Christ has received the end of it amen we are not praying for the seventh seal to be Reve amen amen because we are at the prophet says speaks of the end not the revealing of it the end of it now we will look at this the thing is I read you notice uh the church only came into view once now she doesn't know of the other part but the bride came twice right amen this viewing here that the church came [Music] once this is Page 39 here in my book what is this book Masterpiece Masterpiece amen all right amen now you notice the church only came inter View each Nation each [Music] Nation each na but the Bride come in [Music] twice amen that's why you see there is just the message of the hour M of which everybody can claim in the message of the hour but they don't know about the second time when of the Bride amen now that's why even today there are people that are still Ling behind calling themselves the bride of Christ but they are let behind in the now here it says that's why it says the church only came into view once now this is not the bright this is the church like somebody who who will come here maybe for a a month or for three years then after that he vanishes off he came once he couldn't come into the second now it says the church only came into view once the church but the Bride come in twice am you see because with the Bri is what it was and what she is what she was and what she is still the same lady and coming twice now let me say here all others never appeared no more let me read it but the bride returns back in the last days you can say the return of the Bride amen amen now return the ministry W be the same amen there was her first coming in the last days the bride returns meaning that it's not a new members is the return of the same bride God don't have new members new members no he has the brain now for the second time for God said I will restore the Masterpiece brought up that's the reason she was in reviewed the second amen praise God you know something uh which God was not pleased with he will never return praise God she was reviewed the first time then she was reviewed the second time God loves her so much and trust her so much that she brings her for the second time because he still the same one that God [Applause] you know sometimes in our homes when maybe there's some visitors there there are some there some of the children you want want to display before the because of their behavior you know all those one you just see one suddenly com in grabbing the entire bread and going out now it's hard for the parents to introduce okay now yeah but the bride because uh she has pleased God so much that's why God will always display her like a a good husband with a good wife amen will always review and show her to the big she's a well-mannered wife she won't disappoint amen yeah God bless you we are go we are looking under the seals revealed now we are just looking for few minutes even the the seven SE uh the bride is not confused with the seventh se you know why God even the book that we have read the other day it says God worked it was in his mind if you notice it come by like by Evolution like he was learning all the time make something greater greater but he was above all of it amen now but let me pass to this part that we have read last time now in creation actually he was coming to something let's say maybe God started by creating a tiger and next time it is it being chased by the people and all he was coming to something all the time that's say we had some kind of denominations but that was not the bride because when the Bride Comes she will be like him amen amen amen you don't have to ask question about the bread of Christ no then it says he began to bring upon the Earth life fish fall but the greater part of his mind he was coming to something an image he started with some things maybe would see a bed and you say oh is it like God no he was coming to his image all these denominational years coming to his [Applause] image until the Bible says we shall see him as he is God knowing that we cannot say Amen to all the pictures that are coming we cannot say it's him but that day he say he shall as he passes by display we shall see him as he amen all these other figures shall pass this way that and we shall say no it's not him because we the bride shall see him as he it never said we shall see a church we shall see him but as keep this word as he the person who shall see him as he is somebody who has seen [Music] him amen now if you bring some pictures to they he shall say no this is not the one this is not the one this is not the one because he will see him amen all right amen we we have read this after he has done all this display fishes the bride keeping on saying not this way and then something in his own image amen that's where God stopped God will only stop when he sees himself in you then he will stop before you because he is like looking at a mirror God sees himself amen what does God see when he meets you amen amen because he made the like a mirror that's why it says then this is power of transformation page 10 we read it several times last then something in his own image just like you you'll go around uh joining this church joining that church but what keeps you working on it is because you haven't yet met the one you [Music] know amen amen everywhere you go they are singing I love Jesus but you enter in and no because you are not you don't attend church for music you want to see are we together start off this morning uh what did you think you were picking to go where preparing yourself let's go to church to do what amen so a true Christian even when he wakes up in the morning he is just thinking of seeing that's a true amen all right amen before I close okay then like the other day we read this when he was doing his rounds then it says that something in his own image what you what would you do or what will you do maybe you start in the morning you are trying to look for your own image amen amen you will come back tired in the evening having having not met meet your image then God made sure that he will come with sevenes seven coming to his image it took God a lot the whole thing was just uh in his mind was to come to his image that's why when he opened the Serv [Applause] sto because he knew that my image should be at the seven because back there he said let us make in our amen on which day on which day oh the church is quiet right anyhow let's go with those who are coming and then something in his own image amen God knew that there would never be somebody in His image because he knew that Something In His Image will would be something that he himself because no one could create His Image the only image appeared on the amen amen amen he was not going around asking are you my image smile let me no no no no don't smile meet [Applause] him something in his Now you listen in his [Music] own now only meaning that it is his own image there's no other other image like this one he was not looking for somebody who resembles him he was looking for [Applause] himself something okay amen then he stopped I am tell us about Revelation 8 what it says and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour amen uh when he had opened the seventh SE did he see somebody there am what was that okay then he stopped there because it was up to his Perfection What God calls perfect is when he meets his own [Music] image God can never say to you you are perfect he sees himself that's what you called Perfection not because you have fasted for seven days no no no no the [Music] [Applause] IM and man you find a man who is going around you know sometimes we even look up I can't look around for Jesus but you know since the Bible tells us that he will appear in the sometimes we look up been trying to find him to see him I can't look around in because I know he's coming in in the CLS I'll meet you when don't count yes I am living in the year the Year 2025 20252 now the the the the children of God as somebody says started with this 2025 of this the children of God you are pulled you know sometimes you'll see a child of God looking up like this because he knows that he will [Music] appear amen he won't look around no he's watching it's Unique and then when he find something in his image why all the churches all the denominations why we couldn't join up with those things it is because we were looking for something and we couldn't stop at a certain denomination we only stop when we see [Applause] him amen amen there are people uh we are told the history of some other people but hey this brother he's been fellowshipping many years he's been to Lu and went to this and went to this I ended he ended up they say when he got there he said my children now I have arrived come let us go to church that's when you see even the young boys wearing this bades that's when their father says my children now I have found a place he there's so many churches I was telling a brother I think in Malawi that I don't believe in a Thing Called message churches there's only one church and I said you know why I don't believe in the message churches you want me to reveal this to you amen it is because you get to this message Church they don't believe that were opened they only they've got brother's photo but not the message preached by brother because uh you don't receive a message by reading am you are predestinated amen hey it's not by reading there are people who can't read but they can see amen all right amen some people receive the message by certain taste they come here looking for something they don't find that thing they go there but God in his rounds it says then after creation and all this things then something his not somebody else message image it won't go right I also believe the message see something else now now in his and nothing could come in his own unless it is his own amen and that's why he stopped because it was up to his Perfection amen all right amen you know before I read and stop somebody could think that you go with like around with a photo Prophet then if he says yes God bless you we are together are you angry with me no we are not we were not looking for brother BR we were looking for him but he let us to some body in His image amen amen amen it's not that they say that man is a preacher you must find somebody in His [Applause] image then you can stop them am all right now that's why today it says we we are still coming to the White Stone the Seven Seals closes the New Testament he that is in you I'm trying to say so to make sure that you should know uh the book the book the author the New Testament sealed up the seventh seal yeah the seventh seals closes the new amen maybe somebody's with me here because it is from this to that is the same thing as he said let us make men in our own image amen now the message that's why the message is not down because it keep keeps you coming from this to this to this to this let us make he said let us make in our image now the the the Seven Seals closes not the six but the seven closes the New Testament now we are going to read these things until somebody would say I now is too [Music] much that's why brother I'm not reading this today but when you hit seven he says where are you going now amen because this also when he opened the E what happened because he is still going to continue but when he hit eight why are you agreeing with me when I say eight you can say h Pastor when he hit seven you me saying just go on it says the message of the seven SE in their closing that's the message of the entire the Seven Seals closes the New Testament that's why we are coming to the pyramid have you ever heard preachers or people talking about the pyramid about why all right because the first Bible was zodiac in zodiac we'll come with that and the second Bible in in the pyramid amen what is Pyramid wait until we theam where you find Enoch the first man then the third Bible in a book form now that's why this nowadays uh we are much on the pyramid although people don't know what is pyramid now I was looking at it yesterday that let us take the uh teaching on pyramids what is Pyramid the first man Enoch the man who was responsible for that of the but let's stop will come with the pyramid because if you will notice uh what the people are they they can't [Music] see they are looking for something because some things now are in the pyramid pyramid now if you don't know what pyramid is wait until we bring you the pyramid the first Bible was zodia in the Stars we'll read it from The Book of Job jobob the Bible job knew was even uh those what you call them now conell those who came for the birth of Christ the ma the sign they picked up of the the born Messiah was from zodiac amen M amen now that was first first zodiac was a Bible they would pick up the side let's come and pick them allence now you'll see that what the people don't see today the seven SE and all these other things they they can't see them why because where where are they theam in the pyramid now if you don't know what is a pyram wait until we show you what now they can't see that that is in the now the bride of Christ if the word is in zodiac they read the word in zodiac if the word is in the pyramid amen amen like where we are now we will we will come with the pyramid and show that what is a [Music] pyramid and what is in the pyramid because brother follow here speaking of things in the pyam and he himself the seventh SE that's why people cannot catch up with this things because when they are in the pyramid they they can't see them they don't know anything about they don't even know what is Pyramid brother thank God [Applause] I was talking to a brother that he's here about the Battle of and I said to him you can preach that thing the people don't know what you talking the Battle of because it started back in heaven and came down to the end and ever since it's been raging until to the end and I said such things you can teach about them walking on the roof of the house for inside now you should understand that uh while we are closing there was this woman I'll bring we will bring those things by God's grace where brother bam said she has had from you will see that the message is not from America it's not now if you hear you hear from I heard it this morning she has heard from amen meaning your hearing faculty it's not this yes no you don't hear the word of God with this that's why somebody can come here and be baptized and be with us here for after that she or shees I can't even hear what they saying to hear sound you can only hear sound but not the way amen you'll see of the things which were revealed to the people you know brother bam brother spoke of maybe you'll remind me this woman brother B was speaking about his experience of squirrels and that woman said nothing else but a truth brother nothing else brother the truth and brother says she was on the back said she didn't say it from here have you receive the message she didn't say it from the back side of the house or from here God spoke you know if you are his [Music] child he will even speak in you he will answer for you look brother is speaking and she on the back and he said nothing but she didn't say it from all right amen yeah wonderful yeah this one I'll come back with this one and but because now we are closing are you are we together in this one the seventh the Seven Seals close the New Testament Testament what does that mean does that mean the New Testament is closed amen yeah okay meaning if the New Testament God closes the new that means it will be himself speaking to you amen amen but you'll read in the scripture like that sister brother was speaking but she said nothing but the and he said she didn't say me she didn't say it for God spoke meaning that God answered brother and said is the that's the truth but through the system if you honor God God will he speak through you even the things you couldn't hear the hearing of God will take place [Music] in you don't know it but God knows it you don't hear it but God then he will do it through you amen if you are his child he will answer even the things you you can't you don't know he will tell you but he will use you amen amen so hey we are still coming but [Music] coming h because we are still coming we haven't touched here things but God will give us Grace but now I'll tell you I will read this but somebody even after this still he will be leing behind have you not heard what I no What God Says the seven SE closes the New Testament let me stop here have you heard amen it doesn't mean he closes it for us not to continue reading or believing no that doesn't mean if he closes that means is in you am there Seven Seals the New Testament sealed it it is sealed in you now we know that by prophetic by scientific by the all that amen now we are going to read similar things to this and then we you know sometimes I would say but this pyramid thing is difficult but if we don't bring it we will [Music] be will we be doing God's service no because it should not be like in a school God just says say it some will shook their heads say Amen now the last thing in closing we come in the Lord willing will come and continue and then another thing that's why I repeated itday he stops only when he comes to his own IM because it is up to his Perfection if it says he made men in His image you so God is Not Like Us no when they they say everyone worships God but God is not saying that he talks only of those that worship Him in truth worshipers and in spirit worship God In Truth God separates this things he knows of the true worshipers and Fiers wees when you say everybody worships God I know of true [Applause] worship amen amen one is in touch with God H let me read this L and we will'll come until we enter into the pyramid it will show you that why the people don't see the seven SE the [Music] amen amen I think yesterday I was looking at those things all right amen Jesus came Peter knew him are the Christ son of the Living God and the Judas didn't didn't know him that's why he made a a bit of a saleing the Lord Jesus amen not having a clue the Lord Jesus he just sold him sold him out but you know Jesus said he said yes he said one of you amen but the words Jesus Christ said Jud about Judas he said it is better was not even born that is terrible brother do you know what is Hell let alone before we talk about hell tribulation period we were watching the demons the Fallen Angels you see the river euph D down now they see some caves and the Fallen Angels crying in [Music] there in the second you have the Fallen Angels they came in tormented the Jews now not monsters and things

it is like this you have those Fallen Angels now brother Brenham says there's so many things in this world but they cannot be seen because they are still suppressed by who the presence of the bright now I repeated to the brothers it is like this here you find the bread of Christ and those terrible terrific Spirits they are down their bright is here now they are Sur PR they want to come and do their mischievous things but because of the presence of the Bride they are [Music] supressed now when the bride goes [Music] may he says don't go that way when the bride goes they come up they are now suppressed because bride is here when the bride goes here comes those from the river all that terrible time is there somebody who can hear there's something very strange we listen to what I'm saying
