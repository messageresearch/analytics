And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.

voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the souls thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and I worked much because no man was found a way to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me with Lord Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seventh Souls thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and on the fall of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamp as it had been

asked for this this morning let me read you something here quickly some of the things along the way we will see them City Board I saw seven angels in a form of a pyramid that swept down you know there was the Pyramid of Enoch and the seventh angel messenger Enoch was the seventh men from Adam [Music] brother Brenda was the seventh messenger from Paul um have you seen that all right amen now this seventh Angel messenger um he told us about the Mysteries under the seventh seal is we went through that even last time you know the Mysteries beneath the Mysteries beneath the seventh seal is powerless convinced uh it's not just a topic beneath the seventh seal when powerless companies the seventh seal itself is not just a topic no problems [Music] now I asked for this party this morning with the brothers just like yesterday we went back to uh of that day and after that day now Foods and I've realized that it is still something very deep for Amen to some people who says of that day um [Music] North North foreign foreign [Music] [Music] all right now here is one of them here so now yellow pyramids River because the church itself as the prophet has prophesied that the church is made in the form of a pyramid and again he says the New Jerusalem is in the form of a pyramid the the new city is he saw the the church the bride is built like the New Jerusalem so um and it's been coming up the stages Church the stages then calling it he's calling it the seven steps to God it ends up in the king's chamber the queen against yeah now in my head I have a pyramid a of bricks or stones a brother came there yeah and said hey the prophet says the pyramid is not kept what's it okay and I said the prophet says the seven Thunders kept the pyramid ity oh Autumn Prophet Hallelujah yes meaning that the revelation of the seventh seal kept the pyramid the pyramid you must take up the pyramids in it its forms finally started listening you'll find the Pyramid of Enoch the translation foreign [Music] [Music] which is seven angels from eternity all right amen so you see those things all right amen now yeah he says I saw seven angels in a form of a pyramid I think he lost let this come be sang and see Moses that swept down and pick me up later and I was brought East to open the Seven Seals for God is seven yes discoveries all right amen oh is there anyone who can believe this or is this just a writing foreign [Music] pertaining to the mysteries of God amen I saw seven angels I have never heard somebody uh talking about this I mean as we are going to read here quickly to follow what was said forehead last time we said escalated when the prophet was standing there what's the place again Sabino Canyon Enterprise we went there with the brothers and sisters and when we were on top there yeah and then I looked at the around the place there and our brother there from California pointed to us that he was standing here the prophet um foreign [Applause] um I don't know whether he noticed that I was watching every move move he made then when he pointed a spot yeah yeah he said the prophet stood here when he received when he received that sword yes all right amen and that's why okay I I collected some things there you can come to a place God bless you sir amen by day I will bring it back because I've got mine amen I was alone how yes okay amen we used to sing this song yeah foreign [Music] he saw the Stars foreign had the same problem as they tell me so now now Fort Williams okay that's how lion if he is Advance up to this and the other one licking behind him but even the one that is lacking behind him shooting nothing lose hope is driving a small car one a big foreign I saw seven angels in the form of a pyramid that's brother Brenham speaking I think alone let's let it swapped It Down Speed and pick me up and I was brought East now later now we can go back to the Garden of Eden soon the Garden of Eden was placed Eastward so intimidated meaning there was West speaks of east and west coming together foreign [Music] foreign the angels took him then they lost them and he was taken both to east and west but finally he said UTI East and West has met the Angels Came and this year it says these angels swept down and picked me up and brought me East they think he lost the data they said he ended up being where foreign [Music] his headquarters the headquarters of Adam is so this man who came the seventh yes that's why it confused that he received a sword peoples foreign to the law of restoration God has to restore the sword again as human beings foreign not once that's why God has chosen the cross because the cross puts him in the middle [Music] and when he was in the body was in the grave um the prophet says now um the resurrection when he was in the grave yes his resurrection he was there to pull both sides in foreign is for both sides to be late to bring both sides together now he says his resurrection was through the other end of the sling yeah to connect to the other part meaning to bring God and Men together again Foods if you can receive such a revelation um you will never worry again about the things of the world three days in the the body in the grave yeah the thing was he was supposed to pull both that's why he went down foreign [Music] [Applause] right let's go to this now I've got this here to open the seals for God one can say couldn't God open the sins himself well he said shall open the seals but the thing was how did he do it let's say a Revelation chapter 4 will connect with these things he says I was in the spirit the voice said to him come up ready [Applause] come up from the church ages [Music] come up higher from the church ages [Music] then I will show you things to come foreign but you should come to a place not the church ages if you can look at the church ages if you can look at the church ages right now what used to be Church ages you are looking at what you used to be that's why you see such a confusion because you are looking at what used to be the church ages all right you won't find the bride of Christ there because Revelation 21 says foreign [Music] [Music] you can't see it from a denomination I'll tell you something I was saying to the brothers coming this way we used to have what they called Pentecostals but Pentecostals water happened Acosta but it is no longer than the Pentecost yeah the Pentecost was the anointing if Pentecostal [Music] yeah is that Tech Pentecostals but it is no longer there because you'll find that these ones are Pentecostals they are going that way these ones Pentecostal is going that way and so forth is not Pentecostal record Ed on the day of Pentecost they were in one Accord and foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] behold I will send you a light and a prophet amen amen but today how many do you have different ideas the center the center point of the whole thing all pointing to Pentecost is no longer that Pentecost amen amen we should also be watchful so that we don't remain pointing to the same prophets [Music] but with difference [Applause] aspects but pointing to the same the performance in the word then you see that is not the same way it's not the same thing for the father all right amen now first thing let me read quickly here now here's the throne the first thing he saw the door opened he says the door opened

thingy I uh let us say like the seals a Supernatural Ministry you can receive them by reading them because you have read foreign this thing I have received them from God you don't receive the letter first you are receiving the revelation of what's written in the book you don't receive it by reading yet you must read the book that you are learned by the Revelation that is given to you [Applause] no Revelation is not in a letter form somebody what is in the letter form what is in the letter form the case to you that the thing that is in you almost in the different people in a letter form is this it is it is it is reading what what's in you foreign [Music] he is reading of what's in himself because it is it is there in the Supernatural form and yeah it is in the letter form but it should be in you in the or in the some people don't even worry about this book [Music] because if it is not inside in you you won't read it every food you can only read what is written about you what is in you John oh John the Baptist and he knew himself in the Bible you know what [Music] things according to the Revelation that is in him he had written in the book why is I'm saying something here amen yeah I'm saying something if John John coming to Jordan yeah it will die coding towards the written of him do you see he knew himself he knew that what I Am The Voice meaningly people of one La loyal people could come and say Hussein you are making yourself God with John because he is a working scripture talking scripture immensen from God can talk about brother bring them the way they want foreign foreign [Music] so they are late to say that foreign [Applause] I'm reading about something that is in me already you were made of the message that you are believing if I must are you an African um I can't see it let me check quickly foreign Africa that's why I don't try to change my skin [Music] because no no I have believed that I am an African name of Africa thanking God that I'm an African singing in Africa I'm reading the last things without this book now foreign we are lost again [Music] that's what the Bible says the old creation see it in the Bible look what happened when when the lamb took the book yes when he took yes it was so very important to find somebody with it to take the book [Applause] amen amen and today if I want a Shepherd woman I would look for a Shepherd who is in this book amen because he will be feeding me from the title Deeds [Applause] we want somebody who will preach from the title Deeds then we know that what is a Ministry not from the book but from the heart all right amen we are looking for a ministers foreign ministers who who are a book who are this book [Applause] they are this book see yeah you understand that's how God made it [Music] he made you what you are in this book and you are preaching the way that made you live in the lock away to be who you are you are believing right now [Applause] it is registered in in the book they leave policy but in your heart it is given by revelation you are believing what God says about you otherwise you'll say he is not talking to me [Music] I don't know whether I'm preaching or what that's why Adam without this book he could not meet the requirements [Music] and coach your heart of redemption yeah yeah of he could not meet the requirement of redemption I quote yes it's Redemption means all legal possession [Music] through all that was lost by Adam and if that to do to a born again Christian what ought that to do you need to upon again Christianity it's legal possession today abstract deed amen [Applause] titled Deeds of eternal life you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost again titled it [Music] means that you possessed everything that Adam and Eve lost whatever [Applause] then it says what of it brother the possession of the deed after he has lost this book then it says it says that he could not meet the requirements Redemption without the seventh seal upon the world you we don't have the requirement yeah Redemption Lucia after he found he has lost it he has sinned and he separated himself from God and was on the side of the chasm he could not redeem it is he just couldn't do it because he needed Redemption himself after he has lost the book he himself without the seventh seal now you need Redemption amen amen there are people who Never Bound for preaching without Redemption preaching without the book [Music] they themselves need Redemption the law of God requires a Kingsman Redeemer um [Music] what I like Kingsman is in trouble now he says Jesus to us is a king's man [Applause] that's why when he died his blood redeems as the King's Men He died for the King's Men [Music] he died for the King's Men [Applause] because it is Of The Bloodline that's why Redemption to us comes through the seed of abrahamas and outside of that it's not Redemption it is their seed that is redeemed the seed is planted that is the law of redemption the very same seat back again now when we we were insane it needed a king's man foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] we were Redeemed by plants [Music] he wouldn't have died but because of the king's another King's Men who has lost the book amen amen amen the King's Men sick Lord had to die for the King's Men that's why today [Music] ETA City the law of God required one thing a king's men Redeemer [Applause] [Music] a Kingsman is a member of the family now it took another member of the family to shed his blood to save him [Applause] if a king's man is you know is
