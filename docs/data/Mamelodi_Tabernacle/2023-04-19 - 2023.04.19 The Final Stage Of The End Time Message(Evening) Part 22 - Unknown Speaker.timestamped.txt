[0:02] but now a woman
[0:05] the seventh seal of redemption
[0:10] that the Lord the lamb took within
[0:13] himself
[0:19] yeah
[0:21] it is cold but
[0:23] yeah
[0:26] the Lord
[0:28] the Bible says
[0:31] um
[0:32] I would put like this amen all right
[0:37] we are through here
[0:41] we're going to read that it says it
[0:44] brings Christ into you amen
[0:48] you know Jesus yes you can you know
[0:51] Jesus
[0:53] everybody could
[0:56] accept Jesus
[1:00] but not Christ
[1:04] even the Jews they were satisfied
[1:09] at the name Jesus being Jesus amen to
[1:15] they never persecuted anybody for
[1:18] calling Jesus Jesus
[1:21] for calling him
[1:29] are you aware of that amen
[1:34] today
[1:35] for calling him
[1:38] the seventh seal lead to another spring
[1:41] because he should let me do it like this
[1:47] here is
[1:54] the uh
[1:58] the the book of redemption that the lamp
[2:01] took within himself
[2:07] within himself
[2:11] didn't Jesus say
[2:13] the father is in me
[2:20] amen when asked show us your father
[2:26] he says
[2:27] the father is in me
[2:30] um
[2:32] amen now if their father is in him
[2:36] where is the throne amen
[2:42] all right amen maybe I've got the book
[2:46] for you here
[2:47] I can quickly refer to it ending that is
[2:52] if not we'll see it later
[2:58] he says
[3:00] the prophet of God
[3:03] amen amen because he was sent through
[3:06] him God revealed these things
[3:10] no problem I'll read it to you amen
[3:17] the prophet says
[3:20] you know some of them maybe have got the
[3:23] book since we started
[3:25] things the first Throne was in heaven
[3:31] it's second in Jesus
[3:39] okay
[3:40] now the first throne in heaven
[3:44] and then he condescended was aware the
[3:47] second throne in Jesus
[3:50] Jesus said the father is in me
[3:55] so the second Throne was in him
[3:59] so the book
[4:01] was on the one said on the throne
[4:07] the one that sat on the throne
[4:10] is this one in Jesus
[4:14] amen
[4:15] amen all right this is what this
[4:19] ministry has come to reveal
[4:24] so that's why it says the lamb took the
[4:28] book within himself
[4:33] amen amen and
[4:37] and today she speaks of
[4:40] foreign
[4:42] [Music]
[5:00] if he doesn't say anything from the
[5:02] throne
[5:06] don't accept it is not from his throne
[5:13] then he continues to say uh
[5:17] now with the lamp with the book in his
[5:20] hand then what is we are ready to ask
[5:24] his grace and mercy upon us
[5:28] to open
[5:31] foreign
[6:01] look
[6:03] let me repeat to you again
[6:06] John the Baptist foreign
[6:17] introduced him to the Jews
[6:22] then at the end time
[6:24] his brother is Elijah
[6:27] the seventh messenger um
[6:30] standing in the camp
[6:32] um
[6:34] he's still in the game between Time and
[6:36] Eternity
[6:40] all right amen now if you introduce
[6:43] eternity
[6:49] I want to introduce eternity to you
[6:54] what am I going to introduce our Scion
[7:00] all right amen
[7:03] now
[7:04] here it is
[7:06] let's look at it
[7:11] John introduced Jesus
[7:14] so yes Behold the Lamb of God
[7:19] the sin of the world
[7:23] now
[7:30] foreign
[7:42] [Applause]
[7:52] [Music]
[8:01] he is now here the lamp is here
[8:06] [Applause]
[8:07] because
[8:09] introduced the one who came into him
[8:16] [Applause]
[8:18] you see that is the difference
[8:22] and
[8:24] now that's why Elon if it is the one who
[8:28] is in him
[8:30] the only way for you to see him
[8:35] brother
[8:44] comes into you amen
[8:49] amen
[8:51] that's the only way to see it
[8:56] otherwise
[8:57] you will speak about the one who came to
[9:00] brother
[9:03] and you know nothing about it
[9:08] amen
[9:10] all right amen that's why at the end of
[9:14] it
[9:15] says the weight is now in the bride
[9:24] because as a messenger
[9:27] he has come to introduce the word
[9:34] now the bride must receive the word
[9:37] when the bride received
[9:40] then the messenger says now I must
[9:44] decrease
[9:45] and he must increase
[9:49] man because
[9:51] if the seed
[9:54] given to a woman
[9:56] now she will conceive and she will bring
[10:00] forth
[10:03] [Music]
[10:05] so the children of God
[10:08] like how Jesus was born
[10:15] Joseph had nothing to do with it
[10:20] angel that brought the seed
[10:25] yeah to marry women because the law of
[10:29] reproduction
[10:32] will never take place if there is no
[10:36] woman
[10:36] ourselves
[10:40] amen amen amen
[10:43] it will only
[10:45] will can only be implemented if there is
[10:48] a female
[10:52] that's why God said it is no good that
[10:56] men should be alone
[11:00] amen because he will just remain alone
[11:04] as long as there's no female
[11:09] amen
[11:11] so every seed must come through the
[11:13] field
[11:16] it must come through the field
[11:20] all right
[11:23] so now Adam alone would
[11:25] not bring forth
[11:30] the Lord Jesus alone
[11:32] could not bring forth
[11:35] he must have a bride
[11:41] of men
[11:45] was a go between why why not why
[11:50] negotiating times sent by God
[11:56] uh what kind of a woman it should be
[12:01] because the prophet says
[12:04] he looked for a character
[12:08] and this character should be the same as
[12:11] Christ
[12:15] I don't I don't see Christ woman
[12:20] tolerating a woman who is denying him
[12:27] he says I'm the seventh seal I'm the
[12:31] revelation of the seven series
[12:33] and the wife says no
[12:36] foreign
[12:42] [Music]
[13:04] we are ready to ask for mercy
[13:06] amen amen we are ready to ask for mercy
[13:11] upon us to open the seven seal book to
[13:16] us
[13:18] and let us
[13:24] pass this book
[13:26] when it is opened now you look up past
[13:31] the kitten of time
[13:34] [Applause]
[13:35] prophet
[13:53] [Music]
[14:05] that was beyond
[14:09] the human being
[14:13] amen amen and now the prophet
[14:16] when when this young man okay
[14:21] I saw the enemy coming
[14:24] he said
[14:27] we are in trouble here we are being
[14:30] surrounded
[14:40] who is with us
[14:46] [Applause]
[14:47] because we are more than them
[14:52] [Applause]
[14:54] so this man amen you couldn't understand
[14:57] because he is human Elijah
[15:02] nobody and the name was coming on horses
[15:05] and so forth
[15:07] but the prophet says
[15:10] they that be with us
[15:13] they that are with us
[15:20] amen
[15:21] Hallelujah because now with the prophet
[15:26] there was a beyond the kitten of time
[15:30] [Music]
[15:33] there was a congregation
[15:36] that was beyond the curtain of time
[15:39] and the young man could not see them
[15:44] and the prophet said
[15:47] open his eyes
[15:51] amen
[15:53] he never called for prayer line
[15:56] because they said pool don't need a
[15:59] prayer life
[16:01] it is something that God has promised is
[16:04] going to do he feels I don't attempt so
[16:07] we answer amen
[16:10] is something that God has promised he
[16:13] learned
[16:15] when he arrived at the house of Abraham
[16:19] he never said pray for a child
[16:22] he said I will return according to the
[16:26] time of life and Sarah shall have
[16:31] a son
[16:33] he never said pray
[16:35] foreign
[17:17] amen look
[17:21] donga God promised the Holy Ghost on the
[17:24] day of Pentecost
[17:29] and we don't see Peter calling for a
[17:31] prayer line for the people to receive
[17:33] the Holy Ghost
[17:39] he said go to the upper room
[17:43] and wait amen
[17:47] amen
[17:49] it never said and pray and fast at the
[17:53] time
[17:57] if they do that it's no longer a promise
[18:03] if your father says
[18:07] I'm going to buy you a bicycle it's a
[18:11] promise
[18:14] amen and if you trust you you believe
[18:16] your father
[18:18] you start talking around
[18:22] telling friends my father my dad is
[18:25] gonna buy me
[18:28] amen it's a promise
[18:32] but if you see you we see you starting
[18:35] to pray oh Father you give me a bicycle
[18:39] it's no longer I promise
[18:45] all right
[18:46] [Music]
[18:48] I don't know if there's a farmer here
[18:51] I don't know if there is a family
[18:55] the law is that you bury the seed
[19:07] you will cover it
[19:09] would you leave it we see
[19:11] amen and
[19:14] there is the the law of reproduction
[19:19] the law of growth
[19:24] your work is just to put it down in the
[19:28] ground oh
[19:29] we I am
[19:32] and water it
[19:34] said that's all amen so we don't see a
[19:38] farmer every morning going their way he
[19:40] has put the seed praying oh Lord
[19:48] amen amen
[19:51] oh let it germinate oh my god oh Lord
[19:55] God let it bring forth
[20:00] amen no there is the law
[20:04] in that seed
[20:08] you know the law is in the seed
[20:12] not in the sower
[20:14] I've only
[20:16] no no no no no no no amen the law is in
[20:20] you
[20:21] the law of life
[20:24] in you and when light comes upon it
[20:28] the witch comes
[20:32] it germinates
[20:35] it Springs up to life because it has
[20:39] that law
[20:41] that when the seven seal shall be
[20:43] preached it picks up that seed the Lord
[20:47] that is in that scene
[20:50] and that law in that City
[20:53] comes forth
[20:56] it is revealed
[21:00] because it is the Lord that was put into
[21:03] it
[21:05] but if it is
[21:12] then you've got to preach day and night
[21:17] amen amen and it's if you say it is not
[21:20] revealed
[21:22] because it is not revealed amen
[21:32] foreign
[21:38] yeah I'm telling you the truth
[21:40] some people they believe they see the
[21:44] truth
[21:49] amen if you meet a person
[21:52] who has never seen God
[21:56] and he's been hearing from the people
[21:58] that there is a God
[22:01] now he cannot
[22:03] something that he has never seen
[22:08] who is God
[22:10] then somebody comes home to us
[22:14] to hold a Revival
[22:19] is to for to deny God
[22:25] to say the seven is not revealed you are
[22:28] denying God
[22:31] pick out
[22:33] and there he comes and see
[22:36] there is no God
[22:39] you'll hear somebody jumping say yes
[22:41] amen foreign

[23:53] he just look he was just looking at a
[23:56] man
[23:57] whom he believed to be God's prophets
[24:01] but that day
[24:04] he saw beyond the curtain of time
[24:11] when he's

[25:11] buddy
[25:12] Elisha
[25:15] was this type of the bride of Christ
[25:24] the prophet um
[25:27] he desired and then when to have the
[25:31] same thing that was in that prophet
[25:35] because of God has sent that Prophet
[25:40] to inject in this man amen
[25:49] the real believer is the one who has
[25:53] received what was in Elijah
[25:57] that's not the real believer
[26:00] the real believer today is the one who
[26:04] has received what was in Brotherhood

[26:45] put you back
[26:50] because you don't have the same thing
[26:56] Lord
[26:58] followed Abraham

[27:11] foreign
[27:32] now if you follow

[27:41] longer cope
[27:42] wasn't
[27:44] amen amen amen they follow Jesus
[27:48] until at a certain place he said except
[27:52] you eat the Flesh of the son of man
[27:56] then they went back
[27:59] amen now the Bible didn't say they went
[28:02] away it says they went back 85
[28:11] they went back means
[28:13] they went back way
[28:19] a denomination

[30:29] me what you have received right now
[30:32] so that is a I'm pressing on the upwards
[30:38] [Applause]
[30:44] the Bible says let us run the race that
[30:47] is set before us
[30:49] running a race
[30:51] you run until you hit the finish line
[30:59] and
[31:01] you don't win how
[31:19] there is no winner
[31:23] all they are still fresh
[31:26] amen amen but as the track holds up now
[31:32] some starts to remain behind
[31:37] summer shooting ahead
[31:40] it is like that we'll see we will look
[31:43] at that
[31:45] amen amen if you go to the denomination
[31:49] they read it to you Jesus saves

[32:33] then I I continue
[32:47] Amanda
[32:48] all right
[32:50] amen myself if you have come to Jesus

[33:14] amen to through the stages
[33:17] [Music]
[33:19] amen not a stationary gospel I
[33:24] just run the race
[33:27] that is set before us
[33:30] amen amen amen
[33:34] and run for a price
[33:39] um
[33:40] there is a prize
[33:43] okay
[33:49] uh
[33:52] so this is the part that I wanted to put
[33:56] across this evening
[34:01] amen amen then we'll take it through the
[34:04] through the three stages
[34:08] but we thank God for this one because
[34:12] while I'm picking this
[34:15] size
[34:18] we are gonna continue with this one here
[34:23] where it says where is the book
[34:27] the book here
[34:29] Feast of the trumpets
[34:34] yes Feast of the trumpets here page 15.
[34:38] this is what we are we are trying to
[34:41] look at it
[34:43] says
[34:46] Abraham and and Sarah
[34:50] we're looking for a coming son but baby
[34:56] now this coming soon
[35:00] made by God
[35:03] and uh for 25 years
[35:09] they had to look for it
[35:12] song but they were at the end of the
[35:15] journey
[35:18] when you come to the end now of the
[35:21] journey go figure
[35:24] God had appeared in many forms
[35:28] through the church as he did through the
[35:31] church ages
[35:34] the lights and so forth
[35:37] he spoke to Abraham
[35:39] by Voices
[35:41] but just before the coming son all right
[35:46] and
[35:50] immedi he changed the body of Abraham
[35:53] and Sarah immediately after this so they
[35:57] could receive the son watching Thompson
[36:03] notice the last sign that they've got
[36:06] they've they that they got before the
[36:10] sun arrived was Jehovah walking to them
[36:13] in the form of a man
[36:16] um
[36:24] in the form of a man everything
[36:28] amen meaning that
[36:33] if we were to read
[36:36] I feel that I I should
[36:44] this is what we are going to continue
[36:47] with you listen to this
[36:51] working up in the form of
[36:54] amen
[36:57] that was the last
[36:59] time
[37:00] that was what that was all amen I I will
[37:05] put it this way
[37:06] we'll read them the rest the Lord
[37:09] willing
[37:12] there is
[37:14] let me read you this
[37:18] when God created things
[37:21] finally he came to the final stage of
[37:25] creation
[37:31] but but I read where brother Brennan
[37:33] says
[37:35] this is the uh what do you call
[37:39] this book
[37:40] masterpiece
[37:44] yeah yeah I know
[37:48] you've got to remind the people time and
[37:50] again
[37:54] finally
[37:55] when Jesus was working on a pattern
[38:02] finally they came up forth upon the
[38:05] earth a Perfection
[38:11] and that was a man
[38:18] amen
[38:21] amen I promise you I'm closing listen
[38:24] yeah
[38:26] when he was working working on a pattern
[38:31] creation
[38:34] finally everybody
[38:38] finally
[38:40] there was they came forth upon the Earth
[38:44] perfection
[38:50] and that was a man
[38:55] then he could see
[38:57] Robin
[38:59] in that man that it looked like him
[39:04] I'm not yeah
[39:07] yeah you see amen
[39:09] now finally
[39:12] catch that for tomorrow if God gives us
[39:15] tomorrow finally
[39:21] God could see in that man
[39:27] his only resemblance
[39:30] um
[39:33] so God sort of became
[39:36] men became the mirror of God
[39:42] amen
[39:44] so when God wanted to see himself
