The last time when I ended I end up saying my son my elder son introduced the message. He is the one who has introduced the message to me. blinded but I was blinded and I caused him a lot of problem because I know better than him because I always thought I knew better than him but unfortunately today I'm hearing the [Music] message. Amen. Amen. [Music] Then there was a pastor which I used to refer to him as my father in the lord. I then said to to he must go to see that pastor so that he could understand if am I hearing correctly what is saying when he was back. I then called that pastor. He told me that has demons. I said there was something happening in my life emptiness in me. I felt a vacuum in me. Even when they were preaching where they where they where they were preaching where I was but I could not close the vacuum that I had. But I could not see that this vacuum was being brought by. I could not detect that is the one to close that gap because as it was [Music] happening he told me that my pastor told me that your father will come. But at that time I didn't want to know. I told that I I told myself that I know which is something that is happening even today out there. People think that they know and they do not know. Amen. Amen. I then I then traveled. I went to other prophets, the ones that I know. I I I could feel that I've got a vacuum. I wanted to understand why can can't I get rest. I went Zimbabwe twice trying to find out what is happening to me because I am going to church but my traveling did not help me with anything. The other day the other day and while he was still young, we went to the other prophet at Bush Bag. When we when we get there, I could not find that emptiness. I I could not find anything that could satisfy my emptiness. So when all these things are happening, God is watching as he was watching. I believe now is enough. Now I'm standing up because this man is just misusing lot of time. So what then happened after that? the youngest one. He got sick terribly for three weeks pain having pain and this pain. It was a pain that was on his teeth and his faith had swollen and he had passed. by then I knew when I pray over the people they would heal. But when I was praying over my child and it was as though I was just playing and when all these things are [Music] happening and then I had to do something that I had never had done before. So taking him out to look for prayers is not in the picture at that [Music] time. When I get to those people, they would pray over him. There's nothing wrong. They will say, but there's nothing wrong about this boy. I said, but you can see that he's sick. Then I failed. Are we together? I remember we went deep. I remember we went to other prophet. It was in the night. I was not going for such things because I was still a pastor because God was looking for me and then the boy got sick and I did not know what to do. And then when we get to the prophet, he said, "There is nothing wrong with this boy's pain." And then I would say, "But the prophet says, "Yes, there is a pain, but I can't see anything." Antibiotics, we would give him the antibiotics. We will give him panados when this when when after he has taken antibiotics and they would numb the pain only at that time and would be able to take a breather. But when this sub then the pain starts again for three weeks. in good terms because the devil was blinded me because I could not understand him as the devil was blinding [Music] me. He says seals have been revealed there's a book of the seven but I don't know what he's talking about. are we together and then we would fight. There was a time there's a time where he took me he took me to a restaurant somewhere in he said he want us to just have a conversation but we ended up not even finishing the food and we were now now fighting I couldn't take what he was telling me but now he g said to me, "This boy, if this boy pass on from this earth and you and your son are fighting in this [Music] manner, you must know that that will be a wound that will never recover because the way was, it was as though he's no longer there. I said to her, "What do you want me to [Music] do?" He said to me, "Call his brother." And then said, she said, "Yes." I said, "You call her. You call him." She then took the phone. I don't know whether Yes, there she is. Yeah, you can show him on the screen there. So I said to to her, you call him. He she called him. It was on Saturday was sleeping in her bedroom, crying, pain, in pain. And now I was just watching him. I didn't know what to do. In fact, just to show the condition just to show you how he was around 10 or so in the morning arrived around 10 in the morning. When he arrives, he asked D, "What's happening?" I said, "Here's your little young brother. is sick. We were we were planning to take him to the hospital said when did he when did he start to get sick is almost 3 weeks along. He said why were you not telling me all this time now I'm in I'm in trouble as why was I not telling him are we together because of the because of the pride I had at that time. I said, "Do not ask me further questions. Here's your younger brother sick." So he said to me, "I would ask if you would allow me that I pray over or for because I knew that there were a lot of people who prayed over him and they failed. Here's another one is going to pray. He's also going to fail because the only thing we have to do is to take him to the hospital to show the power of the seven amanda. The revelation of the seven and the power of the third pool was seen or manifested. What is that? But I do not know just put laid his hand on's chest. After he has placed his hand on his chest, he started praying the revelation of the seven se and he called the revelation of the seven seiz. He called the power of the third pool. How when I as he was still laying his head and then finally went into a trance, there was a [Music] demon that was talking through him. And when he was talking, he speaks about the matters, my matters of where I was from. Now I'm watching now. Now there everything which were happening to us and they were they were done by the witches but we did not see. But at that day all was exposed. That car just died. I do not know what killed it. But I found out on that day who was the culprit. But I'm so confused. What is going on? [Music] at that time had his on on him by then because they were sensitive. But at the end that demon out that demon out [Music] powerfully that demon out. After he has driven that demon out that time That pain was gone. Amen. Now he's now he has now gotten my attention because I went all over. I failed. I went to Zimbabwe. I went to places. [Music] What's happening? He said to me, "Daddy, all [Music] along, I was trying to tell you, he has to intervene." So this is not me, but it's God who goes with he doing these things. Let me go back a bit because we had these differences with and with together with his wife. One time they had a child and the child passed on from this earth and I had to be at the funeral as a [Music] That was the time I met with But when the first time I saw him, I saw some somebody like an angel or something like that. I don't know. I saw someone who looked like an angel. Something that I cannot explain. I was always fighting. I I I just felt this humbleness in me as though in the meantime I was fighting with the day. Why did you preach on that day? He spoke about Lazarus where after he has passed on that message so confused. Although I was confused, but I still remember that message from that day. Amen. Amen. Pastor when he tells me that is the God of pastor who has done all this work I said to him let me ask what should I do now because as it is now there's something that is happening [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. So what you give me? He then said to me, you are a pastor. Let me get hold of the pastor or the elders of the church because I now no longer have but is is the elers opportunity they will be able to talk to you let them come now that day we arrange at the same day that day he called I respect respect that man of [Music] God. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's the one who was able to change my life through the codes. I remember that day we stayed until 1 1 in the morning. It was just a word after word. I was just accepting this time. I'm just receiving. I'm not talking I'm not talking much. Amen. Amen. I then ask because he was talking about the baptism. Because we baptizing in the name of the father, son, and the holy ghost. That's how I baptize. Amen. Amen. I I then asked when am I being baptized? At that time there was the wedding of pastor's grandchild and when we at that wedding on Friday but on on the same Friday was here and then we [Music] came we came here at the tabernacle to be baptized. My whole family was baptized. [Music] from that [Music] day I was never ever I was never able to go back. Now the problem now was with the church I'm [Music] holding that after I have found these things excitement now I have this excitement and that emptiness I could feel that I'm now filled I must help these believers [Music] when I was I was not like to preach about the message at the time. Okay. Yeah. So that I do I should not preach the message at that church because those believers they did not know anything about the message. So that it caused the believers to say to me they I'm preaching something that they don't understand. But I believe I believe that it was God's will because after that they told me since now I'm preaching another gospel. They don't know they no longer need me as their pastor. Now I have to compare. Now I've got the [Music] message. I remembered Paul's word where Paul says all that was a prize for [Music] me. I left it back because of the greatness of knowing the Lord. [Applause] after all that has happened. And the the believers took me to the police station. They said, "We we no longer need this person at our church." I said to them, "There was no need to take me to the police station. He was just supposed to tell me because what I have so I had everything at at our church. I had everything instrument and everything instruments and everything. We had we had done a lot of work but and then it came to me that I should call in together. When I called him, I said to him, "Pastor, at my church, I'm no longer wanted. I am where I am now. I want to know where to go." is what go so I took my family says I am lord there's nothing even a single thing it can be instruments of whatever that I took it with me I just left everything [Applause] That's why I'm here today. God bless you. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I sing [Music] for Jesus. For Jesus [Music] and that it's a [Music] reason. I sing and I shout. I sing and I shine for Jesus.

Because I'm not ready to reveal this man. It will end up being grammar issue. Amen. Let us read a scripture. H I promise you know promising the children of God you really must do the right thing. I was this morning having this part. My brother, where is that scripture? Where is that? Did you get the the scriptures? Yeah, it's two scriptures. Genesis [Music] 15:5 right now I can. Amen. Brother, let's bow our heads. Our heavenly father. Amen. [Music] The Holy Ghost. Amen. The creator. Yes. Wonderful Jesus. Amen. This morning we are here by your grace. Hallelujah. To come again. Yes. To worship thee. And uh I was looking at your coming and uh I was watching. I was listening and I have seen it all and I have realized that soon and very soon Jesus will pick us up. Yes. That's why I remain vigilant. I make sure when I go to sleep, I pray to this mighty God who whom before the foundation of the world, we were with him. And he decided [Music] to choose us as his offspring and brought us down here into the body of flesh. But at this point in time, he has decided to call us back to our real bodies. Amen. Lord God, that's why. Yes, sir. Every night I call upon thee to thank you for your mercy. Even now we are here with your children. Lord, I know you have already healed some that are afflicted and you are still before the end of this service, you would have healed some. And Lord God, here is your word. I was looking at how John one morning sent from God to recognize the Lord Jesus Christ. He stood there that morning looking around knowing that somebody is coming. He was waiting for him. As brother Brennan said, some knew that he he is coming, but they were waiting for him to come into flesh. Even now today, Lord God, we are waiting also to take off this flesh as you will call us up into beyond the sky. Amen. One of these days. One of these days, Father, I look unto thee every night and the morning. Time is no more. We are so blessed to know that the Lord Jesus is coming soon and very soon. He will summon us to come. Amen. to meet him in the sky. What a day that will be when we shall take a flight to go back where we came from. Now this morning we have come this way to worship you. So bless us Lord with what you've got for us. Amen. For this morning, heal the sick. Lord, if there's somebody here who is not in the right position with God, my prayer is that time is no more. Those who are predestinated, they know it. They feel it. They see it. They are feeling the coming of the Lord. The rapture is here. If Lord, there's no more time left. What remains is the rapture. We know we have seen it. As I pray in Jesus Christ's name for the reading of your word. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. [Applause] Um yeah. Hey, this is something I want. I have received it just now. I have received it right now. Um yeah, but it it is my secret this one and I'll show to read to some brothers what it all about. Okay, let's read Hebrews. Let me look at the clock there. Uh, our time 12. Now it's 20 12 and it should be up to It should be up to our regular time. Oh, up to 100. after 1:00. God bless you. Our regular time 1:00. Okay. Hebrews chapter 11 from verse 10 to 13. Hebrews 11 10-15. For he looked for a city which have foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who have delivered. Therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the scent which is by the seashore innumerable. This all died in faith. Okay. Amen. I don't know where did you get that scripture from Genesis 15 verse 5. Genesis 15 verse 5. Yeah. But say amen to that one as well because it is the word of God. Amen. He looked for a city. A city. A city. Amen. As we are looking for a city. Amen. Amen. Genesis 15:5. And he brought him forth abroad and said, "Look now toward what heaven and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them." And he said unto him, "So shall thy seed be." Amen. Amen. And uh brother, where is the other scripture? Where is the brother? Where is Genesis 18? Amen. Chapter check if you can count the 15. Mhm. Genesis. Yes. Genesis 15. Help the brother to get the scripture I want to Amen. read Genesis. Yes. Abraham spoke to God about children. And what did God say? This is Genesis 15:5. Okay. And he brought him forth abroad and said, "Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou able to number them." And he said unto him, "So shall thy seed be." And he believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him for righteousness. All right. You may take your seat. Uh I was uh live streaming live and listening to the songs. Yeah, I was together with you. Now I'm going to take by God's grace short time here to introduce uh the things that we are going to dwell on starting Amen. I will say the Lord willing starting next week. [Music] Yeah. Amen. All right. Amen. Now it starts with zodiac. We'll we'll come to that actually. What is zodiac? You know we are going somewhere. Amen. Celestial [Music] constellations the zodiac. Now, the children of Israel, I mean, the seed of Abraham, uh, if you want to know about the seed of Abraham, you must go to zodiac. Amen. Your children shall be like the stars of heaven. Keep that in your soul. We are coming with that. Now it is zodiac zodiac signs of the 12 tribes. as now what a reporter this brother here he always sends me some messages as he frequent he goes to Israel time and again now usually he he he is placed between Israel But when he speaks about the Gentiles, that's when he he will speak to brother Mi. But it started back there when the very same brother spoke to my brother, the father of brother Muzi, very important things. He was telling him that you are there's a man your pastor. There's a man, the very same man. He told the father to brother Muzi Mi about the signs and they're saying to him there is something behind you or you are after something. Amen. Amen. Now the very same man, he is still talking even today uh it is me and brother Muzi. We know the thing. Yeah. So we don't want to Yeah. We don't want to preach about it or to talk a lot about it because it it may become a grammar. Okay. God bless you. Yeah. So now that is the position God has given [Music] you to take from that. And as last time you brought something about the pyramid lights, pyramid lights, there's one uh I won't call the name he said uh of the pastor of this church. He said to to that uh pastor. He said to brother Muzi before we can preach something he was talking about brother M's pastor and brother Muzi understand that man and then we have given the secret to some [Music] individuals individuals because we fear that it may damage some. Amen. Okay, now let's look at this quickly and uh God bless you, brother. M that that thing came from God. And then we know now there's some what they call constellations. Then they say the zodiac and their biblical connections. Now with me you are not going to worry because you know my English is my my English. Amen. But I thank God that I can at least go this far. Abraham, Abraham, a central figure in the Bible, is closely associated with stars. That's why God said, "Look up and see if you can count the stars." That is what you call zodiac. Zodiac. Now we'll come we'll bring the material the full material on zodiac constellations because this is now the end of time and you know I was talking with the brothers recently that as it was the Lord. The Bible says at as it was so shall it be. Amen. Now, then when I watch around, I see what happened back there. Fire, water. Amen. fire was in the time of water. Uhhuh. Amen. That's why Abraham said to [Music] Noah Lord when they separated Lord separated from Abraham and Abraham asked Lord to to choose he didn't fear that Lord will choose his place. Amen. He knew that Lord will never choose his place Abraham and the one he chose before before is destroyed. He chose that place before. Yeah. The Bible says, "So, we read it many times." Amen. Amen. What is your choice today? Now, there were two places there. One for Abraham, the one for Lord. Lord. Amen. Now, Abraham knew that Lord could not choose his place. Amen. Yes, sir. Recently, as I was talking about the zodiac, we were listening with my brother here. I fear to name him because somebody can attack him. [Music] somebody. Yeah. What I'm trying to say is uh I'm looking at some things here. Uh I preached about zodiac pyramid. Now we are going we are going now to the pyramid of angels. But we are we will try to show that when we talk about pyramid all things afterwards he's showing them to us being inside the pyramid something here let me read something here now you may not know What is a pyramid? I'm not talking about the pyramid that you see in I'm talking about the pyramid my prophet spoke about and he even saw me inside that also inside that pyramid. That is the pyramid I'm talking about. All right, let me read something here. Uh, celestial [Music] constellations. Zodiac and their biblical connections. Abraham Abraham central figure in the Bible is closely associated with stars in most of in one of the most sign little significant significant [Music] Abraham Abraham promises made to him by The Lord willing and he if he tries we will arrive at the book of Job. Job used to use constant I mean zodiac as even brotherham told me that uh Job back there he used Zodiac as his Bible. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now when the Lord Jesus was born They came magis. Amen. From the first Bible because the first Bible was zodiac. Amen. That is the first Bible. And he says, "And the zodiac put them into the pyramid." Amen. All right. Amen. We'll come and read them so that it won't be confusing. And I'm just reading on what we going to be talking about. You will follow if you came from him. Amen. Then what is left now? What we are going to look at next time is the pyramid of angels. I quote the prophet. No problem. What we are going to look at after this is the pyramid of angels. And last time we were trying to show some things in the pyramids of which it was just a smaller part of the whole thing because we must arrive where we are in the pyramid. While you are still wondering which pyramid I'm not talking about the pyramid of a stone. I'm going to talk about the pyramid which brother Brenham talked about but it started where it says the the first pyramid by Enoch the stones there were found there ready for to build a pyramid. Amen. Amen. But then it came through down to our time where now do you know last time we spoke about the pyramid and we're trying to show that even the people cannot see the seven seals because I said according to the prophet they are in this pyramid. You see? Amen. Amen. Yeah. Amen. Brother Brenham says the six we see it but the seventh he said it is in the three fold manner and people don't see the seventh but The bride will see it and the bride can see it. I will I will read these things from brother Brennan. How the seventh also was found at the end to be in the pyramid within the pyram. You know the message of the bride is not just a repent. No, we have passed that zone of repentance to this. The rapture is coming very very soon if you can count and see the signs. Okay. Amen. Today I won't belong. That's why God said to Abraham for his children. He said look that means look to the zodiac. Amen. We coming with that. I always want to read what I have received from the prophet. Yeah. So that if you don't understand that would mean you did not understand the prophet not me. Amen. Abraham and the stars meaning Abraham and zodiac. Amen. Right. Amen. Then we also have as we are going to see it I was reading about this one even this morning the zodiac zodiac the things that are within the zodiac. Amen. Amen. And now I can't read this is from my friend the Amen. Amen. And I'm I'll have to read it first. Um whether it will allow me to read it here. The Bible and the constellations. What is zodiac? You went to school. You know what the zodiac is? And the constellations. Amen. Amen. exploring the connection between scripture and the stars knowledge. Amen. Amen. Amen. That time of repent repent. It has passed. This is the rapture now. Amen. Amen. Repent talking about repent because those that are in they are already in. Amen. Amen. Uh the time for coming in has passed. I'll tell you that you are struggling. We are struggling sometimes but the youth they don't live right it does not mean that when the rapture comes you must keep quiet but you'll understand that let me get something here if it is closer to where I am It reads like this. If if this is the right thing I want to Amen. Yeah. Because age the one who inside is inside. The one who is outside is outside. Amen. Amen. Already. It has it has happened already. is the climax. To a sinner is a climax to a believer is a climax. That's all. Amen. Amen. I just want to before I close to read something. Are we together? The time to say come in, get in is over. The one who's inside is inside. The one who is outside is outside. It's either you are in or out. There's no more remedy to put you in. Amen. Amen. It is finished. That which is inside is inside. That which is outside is outside. Should we approach the one that is outside and say brother time is coming? No, it's not time is coming. It is time is here. If you are outside, you will remain outside. If you are inside, you will remain inside. But my prophet told to me that those that are inside now, they are in the pyramid. Okay. Amen. But there's still one question. What is a pyramid? The prophet has spoken of. We are coming to that. We will hear things by his grace. the seventh angel messenger. Amen. Amen. Yeah, it's over. In the book souls in prisons in prison, he even said the door is closed. If you are outside, you are outside. If you are inside, are you listening? Those that are outside, they will remain outside. or those that are inside already they are inside. Amen. Amen. The one that is inside cannot bring somebody else inside because will come you'll realize that it is in the pyramid. Either you are in or you are out. Okay, let me read something. I'm closing here. Okay. You know, h we used I used to also to go to denominations. I used to worship there every day. They will say, "Brethren, we need testimony." Then I will I would listen. Brethren, I I was drinking till the the day set. Now I realize that the people who used to say these things are drinking. Amen. It's not a matter of quit drinking. It's the matter is you are predestinated. Amen. Amen. So the gospel that we are preaching now is not to say come in. If you are a child predestinated, you are in already. I I will bring the prophet. You You listen to the man of God. Mhm. Amen. When he said the door is closed, yes. Amen. Even the one who says, "I have repented." He's talking while standing outside. But you follow, you'll hear the prophet about this time. Even today, there are some that are in some are out. Now there's go there is a gospel for the inside. Amen. Insiders have got their own gospel. the insiders. Brother Brennan speaks about them, the people that are in Amen. Amen. From God. All right. Amen. We'll come to the pyramid. You'll know what it what it is. Last time we were trying to say some things. Amen. I wonder if somebody has seen Let me read a little and then we close. Okay. Amen. Um God's first Bible was in Zodiac. That's why the sign of his birth was in zodiac. They picked up the stars. Then the prophet says, "So they follow the stars of his birth. It was a sign from the first Bible. Job will tell us about it." Amen. Amen. So his his birth was announced from the first Bible. Amen. That woman said, "I know Messiah coming." Oh my God. These are the people who were chosen. Amen. Amen. I know who was that. Now listen. She says, "I know that Messiah cometh. How did she know? And when he is come, he will tell us all things that was the Samaritan woman. Not like this women today were she knew about the coming of the Messiah. And the magis also were waiting for his coming for his birth. Then they saw his birth in zodiac. His birth in zodiac. the stars. They were led by Zodiac to where he was born. Meaning that they were led from the first Bible which is Zodiac. That's why you as the children of Abraham. Amen. Amen. You were led from Zodiac the first Bible. You can't start from the second Bible from the first Bible. That's why the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. The witnesses was the witness was the zodiac. Amen. Okay. Amen. Now instead of going to the nursing home, instead of the major going to the game nursing home, they looked up to Zodiac, the first Bible. Amen. Amen. Because if you miss the first Bible, miss the second. Mhm. So they looked up and they said there his birth is coming. They started to follow Zodiac wherever it went because they they knew that that is his birth. That is the sign of his birth. Amen. Amen. Should we turn to the other way, we will never find him. That's why brother Brennan preach. We have seen his star in the east. We have seen the zodiac sign of his birth. Now we have come to worship. Now, amen. One would say, "How can you worship a baby?" A child. They knew that the one that is coming is not a baby, but he is put in the body of a baby. Amen. Amen. When they look, they followed him not as a baby because they said we have seen his they they didn't say we have seen the stars, we have seen his where Hallelujah. Yeah. But which side? In the east. Yeah. And have come in the east mean because there is east and west. That's why brother Brenam says we will come with that. He says I had to go west from now you'll see when we come to east and west because it says east and west met that's why with us now here uh we are not a church I I will let brother Brennham tell you about that and you'll see where he says h you will find your your place your place in the pyramid. Amen. Just wait until we come and show what is the pyramid. Because even last week we were trying to read something about it and he was talking about the pyramid and the flying interpretation. That is not the stuff of a church. It it can be accepted by those stars. The children of Abraham will still come to the stars and see the stars and the children of Abraham in the stars. We we'll look at the constellation as Job will show is we will look at is is that Job? Yes. Yes. You see how Job his Bible was the first one because he could see zodiac the stars and called them by names. The names. We will bring that also. Today is just to introduce this because it says the first Bible was in zodiac. And he says also and zodiac put them into the pyramid. Now you will realize that when he speaks about says he he he speaks about those who can see those who says the seventh is not revealed. Amen. Amen. Brother says the six still we see it but the seven is not to the public. He doesn't say that means it is there but not for the public. Now the public you realize that these are the people who are not in the pyramid because you are going to see that. The seventh seal is in the pyramid and he says you you shall see even your day in the pyramid. Now we are going to show what is a pyramid. Yeah. Amen. because the Lord is coming to take the pyramids. Then you'll you'll see even Job his Bible was in the was the first the zodiac that was his Bible the all those things but we are coming to that I'm introducing so that I can but we'll follow them by his grace Let me read this you this is not a just a church stuff. No, it is it will only be understood by the his sons and [Music] daughters because he says uh it's the climax age. Mhm. Amen. Okay. Amen. Can I read so two things here? Then inside that pyramid there was a white stone on the inside. Now you are looking for the stone. He says inside of the pyramid the stone that's why the people can't see it or know about it. They do not know about the seventh seal because where it is inside the pyramid pyramid. Yes. Now the first thing we should come and know what is a pyramid. What is that one back there in Egypt? But the pyramid now because it started with Enoch the seventh man and now this is the seventh church age. Amen. Amen. Now the seventh church age should it should be h the sons and daughters of God. uh who who were born here as humans. The bodies were born here but they were not born here. It is your body which was born here. Amen. Amen. It was the body of God which was Jesus. That body was born here. Amen. Amen. forunner. You must always listen to the forerunner. The forerunner came early in the morning. He was sent to recognize him. Amen. Amen. As h the prophet of God was sent also to make him known. Amen. Now Uh the Samaritan woman says, "I know." How did he know? She know Messiah cometh. And when he has come, he will tell us how many things. Meaning he has told us all. That's why I don't need a Bible school. He didn't introduce to us a school. He introduced himself to us. You can't go to school for to learn about God. No, he comes to you inside of you. That's why this woman says, "I know." How did she know a predestinated seed? She knew that the Messiah is coming. Not only that, but when he has come, he will tell us not about the the book of Matthew, but all have you ever heard the all things of God? A person can a man can say to you. I want to tell you all things he will never because all things are with God. Only God can tell you all things. Amen. Praise God. All right. Amen. And but how did this woman know? because she was from the from zodiac children of Abraham from zodiac when the Messiah cometh. She didn't say at school that we were taught that when Messiah comes. No, it is in her. Sure, she doesn't need any school because it is put in her. If it is not inside now, you need a school. Amen. and school don't have it all concerning the word of God. Now, no school can teach you about God. God himself comes into you and into. Amen. Hallelujah. And you know him. This woman says, I know how because it was put in her and she is from him. Now if God has chosen you, he is in you. Then you know, I know the rapture is coming. Amen. She was not a woman preacher. She was a predestinated seed. A predestinated seed. Even today, he's not a person. You will always follow him. Try to do good things. Don't do that. Don't do that. But a child of God inside of him is the super intelligence which is of God. Amen. John comes to Jordan already. God has put it in him. Jesus used to walk there. No one knew him. But John came there. And when the Lord Jesus arrived, he said, "Behold, that was a forerunner." Now, being a forerunner, he knew. Listen, this woman says, "I she doesn't say I I was taught." No, I know personally. I know that the Messiah is coming and I know that when he has come he will tell us all things. Listen, he says, "I know." She didn't say, "We I passed this lesson at a certain certain." It's a personal thing. You as a Christian, it should be a personal thing. You know who is God. You know his law. Because that you will never know it if it is outside outside. I can f more in closing. Let me finish here. In closing, you yourself know. Do you know that in the Bible? Amen. You yourself know. Amen. All right. Amen. So if you know you don't need a teacher. Let me close here. I I we still got things that we are going to uh there are things here. Amen. But some we will come and look at them. Uh let me just look at this. H the pyramid of Enoch. Enoch. Then it comes the pyramid. Hey, you see brother Listen here. The pyramid of angels. Pyramid. Who can know about this? Have you ever pyramid of angels? The angels took me in the pyramid of themselves. I'm going to give you these quotations. This is the prophet speaking. Amen. Amen. Amen. Because he says inside of the pyramid it's he says it is not to the public they can't know about the seven that's why they say it is not revealed because they are without then he says the pyram let me let me inside of the pyramid. It is not to the public how God separates these things. Amen. for the bride. You'll see that you also he says you are in the pyramid. But I'm going I don't want to say it myself. I'm going to read it inside of the pyramid. That mean it is inside of the pyramid. That's why he says it is not the seventh seal is not to the public because it is inside of the pyramid. Pyramid. Amen. All right. The people know about the pyramid in Egypt. Now we come we'll show you the one in Egypt. And even the the bride is made like a pyramid. Yeah. You bring your book because we are going to quote them. The the the bride I I don't quote. Now the bride is made like a pyramid. Amen. That's that that means that you can't receive the seventh seal just from nowhere. It's being building up from zodiac. You receive it because it is in you. Amen. You don't receive it because a preacher is preaching about it. They were taught that the Messiah is coming. But that day they saw it. Amen. Today to us we're going to look at the pyramid. They also were looking at Zodiac. Then they said there he is born. Yeah, he is born. They didn't say the stars are born, but they saw the sign in Zodiac that the Messiah is born. They started to walk. They follow the zodiac. Hallelujah asking where is he that is born king of the Jews. The people didn't know some would say others would say if you can go this way. I remember when we were traveling with my brothers down there in the north. Now we are we we we come across a lady. We ask her about the direction to direct us to where we were supposed to go. Then she started by saying, "Oh, okay. You say you want to to arrive at such and such. Yes, ma'am. Let me see. You know why? She herself didn't know, but she was trying to help. Now we should do this and [Music] speaking alone. You say you want to get to and we said, "Okay, sister, don't worry." Yeah. And but you know she wanted to show us the way. Yeah. Then even if we say sister you say you are going to then we see that this sister she really wants to show us the way. Mhm. Until we said don't worry sister. She said we drove off. Amen. Okay. Because if you don't know the way I don't know it, you just she was struggling to plant it. She wanted us to find a way. She herself didn't know. Yeah, there are preachers like that they preach about the thing and they themselves are not sure of now here comes John. He didn't [Music] say Messiah No. Did you say Jesus? Are you Jesus? Are you Are you Jesus? Behold the lamb of God. How did he notice him? He was a for because the one who has sent him He has given him that. He knew who he has to introduce. He had to introduce. That's why he didn't say to Jesus. I don't want to make me mistake. Are you Jesus? Because anybody can say yes, I'm Jesus. And then you find yourself introducing a drunken. Now if now if he sends he has put the thing already in him. Amen. And then that's why he was looking around say with those eagle eyes. Amen. Amen. And then waiting for the Messiah. He he was not to introduce the one who looked like the Messiah. Messiah. Now I said I I I I'm just coming to introduce. Amen. Amen. That you will see what is a pyramid. What is in the pyramid? All right. Amen. It started with Enoch back there and they are all come like as a pyramid. And then the seven churches also are in the form of I will come to read it where he says the the bride is like a pyramid. I'll come and not not the church the bride is like a pyramid. The city is like a pyramid. So the whole thing is like a pyramid. Okay. The church itself. It fits in the pyramid. It is like a pyramid. Pyramid. But while you are still searching, let us find first what is a pyramid. You find the pyramid of the angels. That's why it is coming. Yeah, it is in seals 576. 576, paragraph 405. Paragraph 405. The angels took me in that pyramid of themselves. Who can interpret [Music] that? Maybe that's why we are we are quiet. Do you believe that brother is a prophet? Amen. Not only the prophet because others they others that appears to the television. The angels. This is the seventh angel. The angels. took me in that pyramid of themselves. Meaning there is a pyramid of angels that will bring them through Yeah. statues. Yeah. Stages. God bless you. God bless you. Amen. Yeah. Then more area on the inside of that pyramid. There was a white stone on the inside. Now we will bring you to this place where it says there's a stone in you and where it says Jesus is that stone. But if he is a stone, then he has put a stone in you. I'm going to read it to you. I'll give you the code. Then I said, "Oh, yeah." That's why I've got a stone in me. Then he said to Peter, "Upon this rock." Because Peter means a small upon this rock. I will build. He He didn't say Peter I want you to build. I You know you are a child of God because he has built that in you. I'll tell you something. H you know today. Yeah. But you you are going to hear things not from me, from the prophet. Amen. I'm also here by his grace. I want to read you the last thing. But otherwise, did you hear this little part that we have introduced? Amen. The angels. If now This stone is not in you. And it says the angels we talking about the the message, the true message ends up in the pyramid. But you should know what is a pyramid. Enoch. Enoch back there. That was of uh stone. That's right. Amen. But the pyramid we are talking about today in this time, we are not talking about the pyram of a stone. But it started there as the pyramid of stone. But today He says the bride is built like a pyramid but it started as a stone that I I I said when we were told that uh the Americans went to the moon. Amen. Amen. What happened is that when the astronauts arrive back with what they thought to be their evidence to show that they they've been to the moon. What was it? A sto. That's why I say one day when I was in Malawi, we were at Lake Malawi Malawi. I was with a brother. Then there's some boulders there close to the lake. So as we were passing, I said to the brother, "Brother, you see this rock, this boulder, it was here when Jesus was here." Amen. Amen. It carries the the the testimony testimony of ages. That's why we say rock of it seems little to million last year. Not the one that started you'll find nothing from that one but the rock of I will show you. I will bring it where it says there's a stone in you now because since he is a rock there's a rock Peter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you my father. Okay. Amen. Now to build a church he spoke about the material first upon this rock and you will hear where the prophet says there is a rock in you for for now h there's something let me not touch it but I and say you will hear this uh where he speaks about the end time. You know what what he has said about men about the end time. Let me I don't want to start reading it. Yes, he spoke of the end time, the children of God in the end time. Now you will hear him as we will read it here. that he is no longer a mediator. [Music] Wait until he speaks for himself. It says he is the Lord Jesus Christ is no longer then I said all right that's why I wondered at these things the people come to church let me not read it please it's just a tip that we are coming you'll wonder today the people come to church young people they come to do they are young their things whether you preach or you don't preach whether you pray for him then I heard it even this morning what is happening I I I've got it I was reading this morning then it will show you of the people they come to church yeah And there's so much power here, but it's for the predestinated. If a person is not right here, we've we have the people that are still smoking. They are drinking there. They come here. You can preach until you turn blue. you want to help them. Predestination is the answer. It's not something that today I'm going to tell them. This youth running around here in the church, I'm going to take them out. I'm going to tell them nothing. Unless they are predestinated. Amen. This cat that comes to my house. First there was a black one. I don't know if it still exist. Then there's a a white one. tree. They are coming in colors. So we have all all all kinds now cats a cat. People are scared of them. People are scared of cats. Even when he's happy, he gets disturbed. They say, "No, this say it belongs to the witches." What is this kid doing here? Then there is power. Power. He's afraid of a cat. Amen. Now, Now there is this one comes to my house. There are two. There is this white one. I always see it. Oh, initially I thought it was a ball. It can position itself. When you look, you just see a round ball. Let me Yeah. Now I realize that the same I still find it in the same place the following day. Now I told this one here is a case it stays there and position itself like a ball. At first, I thought I was going to call someone a paper or I thought it was a folded like this, a round paper like that. Amen. Amen. Then I realized when it stretched itself this is a things like that. Now what I'm saying is tomorrow when I check it's still in that position because people when they see a certain old man had a special whip for the for the can has a cat. Now he get confused. What's What about this cat? This cat don't want a cat here in the house. Amen. Now I just looked at it. I said, "Okay, it will go." No problem. I can't read all this. Amen. Amen. Let me not prophet says speaks something. Why the people but come here and they are continue and being in the church. Now we are not in a church. We are in Christ. The people in the church, they carry on doing their things. Amen. Yes, they do that. If you go to the churches there, I would see it myself. uncle. Let me respect. He would go to whom you call Pentecost. Then now when he lives, my mother and go in there with my mom. He's the brother to my mother. My mother would be so angry because he would smoke a big Z like this. And when he gets money and then he will drink. Amen. Now when my mama says we are going to service and at that time the Pentecost most of you they were singing that time. He loves singing. When they go out he Amen. He rolls the that zone. Yeah. Amen. That's all. Amen. And then usually he puts it on top of the fridge. Now you start hearing. He really loves it. Says, "Amen." Yeah. We'll see you still. My mother. It made him angry because the z was here on top of the bridge. Now when they come back not talking nicely to one another. My mother being angry about this thing on top and angry about when they get there dances more than anyone there. Now, now when they get home, the first thing you place the Z on top of the fridge, I say I said, "How did it go, uncle?" He says, "Ah, no. Trying to tell you." He says, "You know, the way we were blessed You should have gone there yourself. He's doing that busy with the zone. Now we have people like that here in the service they also but they have their own zone and their things. But now the thing is I will not call you are condemned go to hell predestination predestination that is he will not take a he has been called he will not drink and then no one will force him to do those things. No, no, no, no. It should come from God. Predestination not so nice. I even you were predestinated. The real one is that you were predestinated. Let us stand up please. Come out. God bless you.
