[1:12:03] Gracious Lord
[1:12:05] and the great I am,
[1:12:08] thou who was, thou
[1:12:14] eternally.
[1:12:17] Father, we like to thank you once again
[1:12:20] this morning
[1:12:22] for the mercy that you have done into
[1:12:24] our lives and the love that you've
[1:12:28] bestowed upon us.
[1:12:31] We are here Lord Almighty
[1:12:34] this morning
[1:12:36] having uh the prayer requests that come
[1:12:38] from believers.
[1:12:42] Father some of them
[1:12:45] has gone to see their loved ones
[1:12:48] wherever they come from.
[1:12:50] They are traveling Lord Almighty coming
[1:12:53] back
[1:12:55] to Pritoria.
[1:12:57] They are praying Lord Almighty for
[1:12:59] troubling mercy
[1:13:02] as they will be driving home Lord
[1:13:04] Almighty that your angels be with them.
[1:13:08] Some Lord Almighty are requesting
[1:13:13] for an employment.
[1:13:18] We know Lord Almighty that you have a
[1:13:22] job for them
[1:13:24] and gracious Lord that you will give it
[1:13:27] back to them.
[1:13:30] And of course some Lord Almighty have
[1:13:32] got physical,
[1:13:35] spiritual
[1:13:38] and have the soul problem.
[1:13:43] We know that there are demons that
[1:13:45] torments the bodies
[1:13:47] and there are demons that torments the
[1:13:49] spirits and also there are demons that
[1:13:53] torments the souls.
[1:13:56] But father, there was a time
[1:13:59] when somebody
[1:14:02] sent his men to go
[1:14:05] and find out from Bel Zebab, [music] the
[1:14:08] king of the demons.
[1:14:11] That did not please you, Lord. That is
[1:14:14] why the prophet turned them back and
[1:14:16] said, "Is there no bomb in Gilead?"
[1:14:21] and fight and and today Lord Almighty
[1:14:25] we won't go to any other demons.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Neither will we listen to any other
[1:14:31] demon.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; We will always father refer to you. We
[1:14:37] know that you are a jealous God.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; You are the only one Lord that needs to
[1:14:41] be woripped.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Father we commit them unto thee Lord in
[1:14:46] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:14:49] Knowing Lord that when we hear
[1:14:54] we'll end up seeing and also end up
[1:14:57] understanding.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; So have mercy upon them Lord Almighty
[1:15:03] and give them according to their hearts
[1:15:06] that we pray calling upon the name of
[1:15:10] our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.

[1:20:40] but let me give you a chance just to
[1:20:42] come and say something to the church.
[1:20:46] Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:52] Well, God bless you all.
[1:20:54] It's been a wonderful time to be here.
[1:20:59] This is my third my third time here.
[1:21:02] I I'm very thankful. I'm always treated
[1:21:04] so royally every day.
[1:21:07] Thank you for that.
[1:21:09] I woke up this morning. I was thinking
[1:21:11] about uh God will double his word
[1:21:16] uh in uh the book of Genesis. I believe
[1:21:19] it's Genesis chapter 41.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; When Joseph interpreted Pharaoh's dream,
[1:21:29] he said that both of those things, the
[1:21:33] cattle and the wheat,
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; were both the same thing.
[1:21:40] The dream was being said with different
[1:21:43] examples, but it was the same dream.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; And he said that the reason for that is
[1:21:50] because God was confirming his word by
[1:21:54] doubling it. So to me that is basically
[1:21:57] like saying yay and amen.
[1:22:02] Amen. And uh as I said the other day and
[1:22:05] I'll
[1:22:06] format it again this morning because
[1:22:09] because life is like a vapor
[1:22:13] and we know not what will be on the
[1:22:15] tomorrow.
[1:22:18] I will say if I have an invitation
[1:22:22] and if the Lord is willing
[1:22:25] to turn back again to see you.
[1:22:28] God bless you. Thank you very [applause]
[1:22:30] much. Hallelujah.
[1:22:36] Hallelujah.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; One more time, can we give him a round
[1:22:41] of applause?
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; So, we are going to a very crucial time.
[1:22:51] The time of the word of the Lord.
[1:22:54] Are we all ready for the word?
[1:22:57] As we stand up on our feet
[1:23:00] to welcome our deacon, brother
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; for the word of God. Amen.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:13] But in the days
[1:23:15] of the voice
[1:23:18] of the
[1:23:22] shadow
[1:23:25] [music]
[1:23:29] begin
[1:23:32] to sound
[1:23:35] that [music and singing]
[1:23:41] God [music]
[1:23:43] should be finished

[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; We are just going to go straight into
[1:26:04] the word.
[1:26:08] There's a song.
[1:26:10] The day of redemption is
[1:26:17] if we can just sing a stanza before we
[1:26:20] read the word.

[1:26:27] you.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Nations are breaking.

[1:26:50] told
[1:26:53] [music]
[1:26:55] [singing]
[1:26:57] with horset
[1:26:59] [music]
[1:27:01] [singing]
[1:27:03] will unfold.

[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; As we ask our elder Elder Reed to say a
[1:28:16] word of prayer,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; then after we will read the scriptures.
[1:28:25] God bless you.
[1:28:31] Thank you, dear Lord, as we come before
[1:28:33] you, dear God, that you'll speak to our
[1:28:36] hearts, dear Lord, and anoint [music]
[1:28:39] brother Matheisa here as he speaks. We
[1:28:42] commit the service into your hands in
[1:28:44] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Let us turn to Revelation 3 verse 5.
[1:29:00] and Revelation 13 verse 8.
[1:29:05] Revelation 13:8,
[1:29:11] Revelation 3:5.
[1:29:15] He that overcomemeth, the same shall be
[1:29:18] clothed in white remnant,
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; and I will not blot out his name out of
[1:29:23] the book of life, but I will confess his
[1:29:26] name before my father and before his
[1:29:28] angels.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Revelation 13.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Chapter 13,
[1:29:36] verse 8.
[1:29:41] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:29:43] worship him whose names are not written
[1:29:46] in the book of life of the lamb slain
[1:29:49] from the foundation of the world. And
[1:29:52] the last scripture will be Revelation 5
[1:29:56] verse 1
[1:29:58] and verse 7. Revelation 5 verse 1 and 7.
[1:30:05] And I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:30:07] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:30:10] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:30:13] seals. Verse seven. And he came and took
[1:30:17] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:30:19] that sat upon the throne.
[1:30:22] God bless you.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; You may take your seat.
[1:30:35] I'm going to title this message
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; the book of redemption
[1:30:47] and the subtitle or text
[1:30:56] the book of life
[1:30:59] and the Lamb's Book of Life.
[1:31:10] I'm going to take my time
[1:31:15] just to give the introduction.
[1:31:20] We
[1:31:22] have the book of redemption.
[1:31:27] When we read Revelation chapter 5,
[1:31:32] it talks about a book.
[1:31:37] But then when we read other scriptures,
[1:31:42] it talks about two books.
[1:31:47] Now I'm going to read from the spoken
[1:31:50] word communion.
[1:31:53] communion.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Um, my message was inspired from
[1:31:59] one of the messages that the pastor
[1:32:01] preached
[1:32:07] being identified
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; with Christ.
[1:32:13] And in those slides that the pastor
[1:32:16] shared with us,
[1:32:19] the pastor touched on the lamb's book of
[1:32:22] life
[1:32:26] and the book of life.
[1:32:28] Now the prophet says here,
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; the two books
[1:32:35] being one,
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; the book of life.
[1:32:41] So the prophet says
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; the Baptist
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; believe there's two separate books
[1:32:52] and in one way
[1:32:54] it is two separate books
[1:32:59] another way
[1:33:01] it is not two separate books.
[1:33:07] So the two books
[1:33:11] the prophet says
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; being one.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; So the first book is the book of life.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Then there is the lamb's book of life.
[1:33:29] Now the prophet says is one book.
[1:33:34] So that's
[1:33:38] what I want to share with you today.
[1:33:44] It says these two books are very
[1:33:46] mysterious.
[1:33:50] Says there you are two books.
[1:33:54] One of them is the lamb's book of life
[1:33:58] and the other one is the book of life.
[1:34:04] And he says the first book of life
[1:34:07] was when you were born.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; That was your natural birth.
[1:34:15] So not everybody
[1:34:18] is recorded in the book of life.
[1:34:26] But the prophet says and the Bible says
[1:34:30] your name was written in the book of
[1:34:34] life before the foundation.
[1:34:38] And it says again your name was written
[1:34:42] in the lamb's book of life
[1:34:45] before the foundation.
[1:34:48] But it comes back again and say
[1:34:51] the first book of life
[1:34:54] was when you were born.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; That was your natural birth.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:06] And
[1:35:09] the prophet says on the invisible union
[1:35:12] of the bride of Christ
[1:35:19] says in the book of life.
[1:35:23] one says,
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; you can put your name on
[1:35:32] and again
[1:35:35] your name can be taken out of the book
[1:35:38] of life.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:49] When you read
[1:35:51] another book, the prophet says
[1:35:56] works is faith expressed
[1:36:00] says the two books of life
[1:36:04] is the same book
[1:36:06] meaning the book of life and the lamb's
[1:36:08] book of life
[1:36:11] is one book but one of them
[1:36:16] is your natural
[1:36:17] birth.
[1:36:20] The other one is your spiritual birth.
[1:36:25] One leads out to the other one.
[1:36:31] Meaning you are transferred
[1:36:36] from one book
[1:36:39] to the other book.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; There is your two books.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; One of them is the lamb's book of life.
[1:36:57] Your name
[1:37:00] on there
[1:37:03] is predestinated.
[1:37:07] It can go.
[1:37:11] Yes,
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; it was for ordained to be in there.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; But the regular book of life,
[1:37:26] your name
[1:37:28] can be taken off.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; If you don't repent,
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; it's taken off.
[1:37:42] Now the prophet also says
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; you are transferred
[1:37:52] from the book of life
[1:37:55] to the lamb's book of life
[1:38:00] and we will look at it before we close
[1:38:04] where the prophet talks about
[1:38:07] mediatorial work prophet
[1:38:12] and redemption
[1:38:17] your name
[1:38:20] when God is well pleased.
[1:38:26] Remember we talked about the placing of
[1:38:28] the son.
[1:38:31] Now the Holy Ghost
[1:38:35] is your tutor.
[1:38:39] Now the truth
[1:38:43] brings the word
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; to the almighty God,
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; the father
[1:38:50] and and report [snorts] you
[1:38:57] and if the father is pleased with the
[1:38:59] report
[1:39:03] then you are adopted.
[1:39:07] You see
[1:39:09] The Holy Ghost
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; is a teacher.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; is a tutor.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost put you positionally.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says
[1:39:30] it brings the word
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; to the father.
[1:39:35] Amen.
[1:39:38] And and if the father is pleased with
[1:39:40] the report,
[1:39:44] then you are transferred
[1:39:47] from the book of life
[1:39:50] into the lamb's book of life.
[1:39:55] Let me read this.
[1:39:59] The prophet says,
[1:40:02] "You separated from your first union.
[1:40:08] by spiritual death.
[1:40:11] That means
[1:40:14] your first union
[1:40:17] is when you were born,
[1:40:19] your natural birth
[1:40:22] brings you into the book of life.
[1:40:26] That is your first union.
[1:40:29] Then by spiritual death,
[1:40:33] you know Paul said it is not me that
[1:40:36] deliver.
[1:40:38] You see that is what we call spiritual.
[1:40:43] Meaning now
[1:40:45] you are born.
[1:40:47] You are remarried again
[1:40:51] to the new spiritual union.
[1:40:55] Not of your natural life.
[1:40:59] but of eternal life.
[1:41:02] That gem that was in you at the
[1:41:05] beginning
[1:41:08] found you.
[1:41:11] So that's why now the old book is gone
[1:41:16] which is your old union.
[1:41:20] Now you are transferred
[1:41:23] into the new book
[1:41:26] not the book of life.
[1:41:29] But the lamb's book
[1:41:34] what the lamb redeemed
[1:41:37] you see the lamp
[1:41:40] during the mediatorial work
[1:41:45] was standing
[1:41:47] in for you
[1:41:50] to be transferred.
[1:41:54] Then once all are transferred
[1:41:59] The prophet says, "Now the lamb redeem
[1:42:05] what?
[1:42:07] Those that are in the lamb's book of
[1:42:09] life.
[1:42:15] Let me read it again. Your name is now
[1:42:18] in the new book.
[1:42:22] Not the book of life,
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; but the lamb's book of life.
[1:42:29] That is what the lamb came to redeem.
[1:42:34] You see, redemption
[1:42:36] is not for those that are in the book of
[1:42:38] life.
[1:42:40] It's for those that are in the lamb's
[1:42:42] life.
[1:42:44] That's what he came to.
[1:42:50] Your new life
[1:42:52] is in the lamb's book of life.
[1:42:56] Your marriage certificate.
[1:43:00] You know, pastor
[1:43:02] talk the Lord about the marriage
[1:43:05] certificate.
[1:43:07] And I must confess
[1:43:09] I didn't know what he was talking about.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; It was just cremework to say the
[1:43:17] revelation of the seven se
[1:43:20] is the marriage certificate.
[1:43:23] Amen.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; I don't know how many times he said
[1:43:27] that,
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; but now
[1:43:31] when we see it,
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; you know, I really appreciate
[1:43:39] the believers,
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; they take the clips of the pastor
[1:43:47] and they post them.
[1:43:49] And when you listen to them,
[1:43:52] you get blessed
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; because
[1:43:58] sometimes we sit in the service
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; and we shout,
[1:44:04] "Amen, hallelujah, amen, hallelujah.
[1:44:07] But some of the things they just pass
[1:44:10] through our head.
[1:44:13] But when you sit and listen to the
[1:44:16] teachings
[1:44:18] of pastor,
[1:44:21] it is a blessing.
[1:44:24] Amen. [applause]
[1:44:25] So this church was truly blessed.
[1:44:31] Now your new life
[1:44:34] is in the lamb's book
[1:44:37] of life. your marriage certificate.
[1:44:43] Now, we know the book of life
[1:44:46] and we know the lamb's book of life.
[1:44:49] Now, the book of life,
[1:44:53] they come in the second resurrection.
[1:44:56] So, it's not safe there.
[1:45:01] So, if you remain in the book of life,
[1:45:05] you are coming up in the second
[1:45:07] resurrection.
[1:45:10] But those that are in the lamb's book,
[1:45:14] they come in the first result,
[1:45:16] those are the people that are going in
[1:45:19] the rapture.
[1:45:21] Those that are in the lamb's book,
[1:45:26] but those that are in the book of life,
[1:45:30] the prophet says
[1:45:33] you can be blotted out.
[1:45:38] Let let's just look at it.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; It says first of all
[1:45:44] let us review our cases.
[1:45:49] Now this is in the church age book ages
[1:45:54] says we know most assuredly
[1:45:58] that the purpose of God stands in
[1:46:00] election.
[1:46:03] It was purposed in himself.
[1:46:08] It was God's purpose
[1:46:11] to bring forth a people like unto
[1:46:13] himself,
[1:46:17] a word bride.
[1:46:20] You see, this was chosen before the
[1:46:22] foundation.
[1:46:25] She was fornown
[1:46:28] and beloved
[1:46:30] before
[1:46:32] she was ever brought forth
[1:46:35] during the ages. [snorts]
[1:46:39] She was redeemed by his blood
[1:46:43] and can never come into condemnation.
[1:46:48] She can never be in the judgment
[1:46:52] because sin cannot be imputed unto her.
[1:46:59] Amen. You see, those are those in the
[1:47:02] section of the lamb's book of life.
[1:47:07] They were chosen before the foundation
[1:47:09] of
[1:47:12] secondly
[1:47:14] there's another class.
[1:47:17] Their names are also in the book of life
[1:47:22] and they will come up
[1:47:25] in the second resurrection.
[1:47:29] So it is not safe to be in the book of
[1:47:31] life
[1:47:34] because you come up in the second
[1:47:35] resurrection.
[1:47:38] Such are the foolish visions
[1:47:43] and the righteous
[1:47:46] as are spoken of in Matthew 25.
[1:47:51] You see, when you read the book of
[1:47:52] Matthew 25,
[1:47:54] talks about the 10 visions,
[1:47:56] those that have oil
[1:48:00] and there are those that do not have oil
[1:48:02] in their lives.
[1:48:05] And the Bible says they both slept.
[1:48:12] I believe
[1:48:15] they both
[1:48:16] went under the old
[1:48:20] and we look at it.
[1:48:23] Now
[1:48:25] this class
[1:48:28] you have those that had oil,
[1:48:30] [clears throat]
[1:48:31] you have those that do not have oil.
[1:48:35] Hallelujah.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:48:38] when
[1:48:40] a shout came
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; to say the bridegroom cometh,
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; those that had oil went to the marriage
[1:48:50] supper.
[1:48:53] But those foolish visions,
[1:48:56] they went to buy oil.
[1:49:00] Coming back,
[1:49:01] the Lord said, "I don't know you.
[1:49:04] But they are from the book of life.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "I don't know."
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible says,
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 20, Revelation,
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; they come up.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; They come up in the second resurrection.
[1:49:21] They receive their eternal life
[1:49:24] in the judgment.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; That is the second class.
[1:49:32] Now before we leave this,
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; there is a portion that I want to talk
[1:49:39] about.
[1:49:42] There are those that are under the
[1:49:44] altar.
[1:49:49] Crying, how long, how long, oh Lord?
[1:49:54] Now that is not the bride.
[1:49:57] Those are the Jews.
[1:50:00] They cry after the rapture.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; When the bride
[1:50:06] leaves
[1:50:08] the sixth dimension
[1:50:12] going for the marriage supper,
[1:50:15] these Jews,
[1:50:18] they start crying.
[1:50:20] How long? How long?
[1:50:23] Now they are not crying. They start
[1:50:25] crying. When the bride leaves the sixth
[1:50:29] dimension dimension
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; that is in the rapture when the bride is
[1:50:33] going for the marriage supper.
[1:50:36] Now the prophet says
[1:50:38] they start crying
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; to say how long how long oh Lord.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Now the Bible says
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; the Lord said wait until your fellow
[1:50:51] brethrens
[1:50:55] has been mired
[1:50:58] as you are. Now these Jews are those
[1:51:03] that
[1:51:05] died for the testimony which they held
[1:51:13] and they were standing for the word of
[1:51:15] God.
[1:51:17] They did not die
[1:51:20] for the testimony of Jesus.
[1:51:22] They rejected the Messiah.
[1:51:27] So they know nothing about themselves
[1:51:30] but because they were blinded
[1:51:33] for our sake
[1:51:36] God give them eternal life.
[1:51:39] Hitler
[1:51:42] man killed them.
[1:51:46] They went under the old
[1:51:49] of the Matias.
[1:51:53] Now
[1:51:56] they come up
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; in the second resurrection.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; So they are not going to see the
[1:52:04] millennia.
[1:52:07] That's what the prophet says
[1:52:10] is the 144,000
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; 144,000
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; that is mati
[1:52:16] for the testimony of Jesus.
[1:52:19] The Lord left the marriage supper
[1:52:24] to
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; introduce himself
[1:52:26] to the 144,000 144,000.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; That's why
[1:52:32] my pastor said they are going to be
[1:52:36] serving the bride in the millennium
[1:52:41] as the uns.
[1:52:44] You know if you were taught under pastor
[1:52:46] Israel
[1:52:50] you come from a high university
[1:52:55] [applause and cheering]
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; truly if you were under the ministry of
[1:53:02] pastor Israel
[1:53:06] you are blessed.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:09] You see the 144,000
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; 144,000
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; they are in the millennium
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; but this ones that were killed by Hitler
[1:53:18] and Stalin
[1:53:21] they cry how long how long
[1:53:25] and the prophet says they come in the
[1:53:27] second.
[1:53:29] So for 1,000 years
[1:53:33] they are waiting
[1:53:35] under the oil
[1:53:37] waiting for the second resurrection.
[1:53:42] Now let's go to the third class
[1:53:45] because the first class is the bride in
[1:53:49] the lamb's book of life. The second
[1:53:51] class
[1:53:53] are those that are in the book of life.
[1:53:57] The prophet give an example about the
[1:53:59] foolish vision.
[1:54:02] They come up in the second resurrection.
[1:54:05] We are in the book of life.
[1:54:09] Now the prophet says
[1:54:13] there are those
[1:54:16] now this is another class
[1:54:19] the third class.
[1:54:21] This are the borderline Christians.
[1:54:28] And he give an example about those
[1:54:30] Israelite coming out of Egypt.
[1:54:35] This
[1:54:37] failed
[1:54:39] to obey God,
[1:54:42] but they are in the book of life,
[1:54:46] but they failed to obey
[1:54:50] and being void of the spirit.
[1:54:54] Though even the signs and wonders were
[1:54:56] amongst them
[1:55:00] will have their names removed
[1:55:05] from the book of life.
[1:55:08] Can the brother show us that diagram?
[1:55:15] You see
[1:55:17] my brother
[1:55:19] I don't know how to use this. Oh,
[1:55:24] just bear with me.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; You see, this is the book of life.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says those that overcome,
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; they are transferred into the lamb's
[1:55:37] book of life.
[1:55:40] That's why during the seven church age
[1:55:43] saying he that overcome
[1:55:46] he that overcome
[1:55:49] even those that received the white stone
[1:55:52] are the overcomers.
[1:55:55] So in the book of life, no white stone.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; The overcomers,
[1:56:04] the one that received the white stone
[1:56:07] are the one that are transferred in the
[1:56:09] lamb's book of life.
[1:56:13] Now we have those
[1:56:17] unfortunately my arrow moved out here.
[1:56:22] You remember Judas,
[1:56:25] the one that betrayed the Lord Jesus
[1:56:27] Christ.
[1:56:29] The prophet says he was in the book of
[1:56:30] life,
[1:56:33] but he was blotted out.
[1:56:37] And the prophet says it was better if he
[1:56:40] was not even born.
[1:56:44] You see, the natural birth
[1:56:47] brought him into the book of life.
[1:56:50] But he was blotted off.
[1:56:53] So the prophet says that is the third
[1:56:56] class
[1:56:59] the natural birth
[1:57:02] brings them into the book of life
[1:57:06] but because they failed to repent
[1:57:09] they are blotted out. In another spoken
[1:57:13] word he says these are the people that
[1:57:16] grieved the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:19] They were blotted out.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; We'll come back to them.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; There's the fourth class.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; This natural birth
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; didn't even bring them into the
[1:57:38] book of life.
[1:57:40] The prophet says they were recorded
[1:57:43] somewhere.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Let's read Revelation 17:8.
[1:57:52] You know when the pastor read this
[1:57:54] scripture
[1:57:56] I thought you know sometimes you read
[1:57:58] the scripture you don't see anything
[1:58:02] then the pastor come and read the
[1:58:03] scripture
[1:58:05] and you think he just wrote that
[1:58:06] scripture
[1:58:09] but the scripture has been there
[1:58:12] revelation 17 my brother verse eight
[1:58:15] [clears throat]
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; the beast that thou sawest was and is
[1:58:21] the beast that thou seest was and is not
[1:58:24] and shall ascend out of the bottomless
[1:58:27] pit and go into petition and they that
[1:58:30] dwell on the earth shall wonder whose
[1:58:33] names
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; uh stop there.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; You see when he start by saying the
[1:58:39] beast and thou h so was and is not you
[1:58:43] know say hey now these things are
[1:58:45] getting difficult.
[1:58:51] But as you continue
[1:58:54] it says
[1:58:56] whose names
[1:58:58] were not written
[1:59:00] in the book of life.
[1:59:03] So meaning they were born
[1:59:06] but they were not recorded in the book
[1:59:08] of life.
[1:59:11] And the prophet says that is the fourth
[1:59:14] class.
[1:59:16] And he give an example. He says Pharaoh
[1:59:20] Pharaoh was never in the book of life.
[1:59:24] He was born
[1:59:29] recorded somewhere.
[1:59:31] And the prophet says these ones that
[1:59:34] were not even in the book of life
[1:59:39] straight to the lake of fire.
[1:59:43] You see with Judas
[1:59:45] he says it was better he was not
[1:59:49] he was blotted out he's going to the
[1:59:52] lake of fire
[1:59:54] this ones
[1:59:57] like Pharaoh
[2:00:01] the prophet says
[2:00:05] they were never even in the book of life
[2:00:09] straight to the lake
[2:00:12] and Balam
[2:00:15] was on the third class.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; He was blotted out
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; from the book of life.
[2:00:26] Now it says
[2:00:28] those whose names are not written in the
[2:00:31] book of life of the lambs slain from the
[2:00:33] foundation of the world
[2:00:39] they will come in the second
[2:00:40] resurrection
[2:00:42] if they were in the book of life
[2:00:45] but those that were brought out
[2:00:48] or those that were not even in the book
[2:00:50] of life
[2:00:52] straight to the lake of
[2:00:55] Amen. Amen.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; I believe now we understand
[2:01:00] the book of life and the lamb's book of
[2:01:03] life.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Now let's read something here in the
[2:01:09] lamb's book of life.
[2:01:12] Spoken word lamb's book of life.
[2:01:18] Uh page 18.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Page 18.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 135.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 135.
[2:01:25] He says,
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; let's start from paragraph 134.
[2:01:29] Paragraph 134.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; And he deceived all
[2:01:35] except those whose names were written in
[2:01:37] the lamb's book of life.
[2:01:42] He deceived all
[2:01:44] the whole earth, the religious cult.
[2:01:50] He de he deceived all
[2:01:54] with his great propaganda.
[2:02:02] We are all one big church
[2:02:06] and we out to all unite together
[2:02:11] and have the things of the world.
[2:02:15] And the prophet says
[2:02:17] thousands
[2:02:19] of mothers,
[2:02:21] millions of them
[2:02:24] will say, "That's the thing we want.
[2:02:29] Watch where it comes from."
[2:02:32] Sister, watch where the background of it
[2:02:35] is.
[2:02:38] And he deceived all
[2:02:42] whose names were written in the lamb's
[2:02:44] book.
[2:02:47] He deceived all
[2:02:50] whose names are not written in the
[2:02:54] lamb's book of life.
[2:02:57] Amen. Amen.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet says.
[2:03:02] Those that are not in the book of life,
[2:03:05] in the lamb's book of life,
[2:03:08] they can be deceived.
[2:03:12] But those that are in the book of life,
[2:03:14] in the lamb's book of life,
[2:03:17] they cannot be deceived.
[2:03:22] Now, let's go back,
[2:03:28] my brother. Read Ephesians chapter 1
[2:03:32] verse4.
[2:03:46] Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4.
[2:03:49] according as he hath chosen us in him
[2:03:52] before the foundation of the world that
[2:03:55] we should be holy and without blame
[2:03:57] before him in love.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; You see the prophet says
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; he wrote our names
[2:04:06] in the lamb's book of life
[2:04:09] before the foundation.
[2:04:11] Amen.
[2:04:14] Now you see the names were written
[2:04:19] in the lamb's book of life.
[2:04:22] Now that's why he says he chose us in
[2:04:26] him.
[2:04:30] You see now he was before the foundation
[2:04:35] he said
[2:04:37] he he he wrote the names.
[2:04:41] Now the prophet says,
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; uh,
[2:04:47] I just want to to to to to read this
[2:05:06] Let me just go back to the book of seals
[2:05:15] uh 103
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; uh book of seals page 103.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; he chose us
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; in him.
[2:05:31] Hallelujah.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; That's when he was writing
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; our names in the lamb's book of life.
[2:05:41] Now when the time of redemption came,
[2:05:46] he took the book within himself
[2:05:51] because he chose us in him.
[2:05:54] You see the book of redemption.
[2:05:57] He chose us in him.
[2:06:00] Then when the redemption come
[2:06:03] he took the book in him that was the
[2:06:07] last book of faith
[2:06:11] now
[2:06:12] the portion that I wanted to read
[2:06:17] it says that's the way we were we are
[2:06:20] here
[2:06:22] we come from a higher being
[2:06:26] before the foundation
[2:06:29] In the beginning we were in the image of
[2:06:31] God.
[2:06:33] You see the prophet says when God said
[2:06:37] let us make man in our own
[2:06:41] he was writing our names before the
[2:06:44] foundation.
[2:06:46] And he says
[2:06:48] the veil and the darkness
[2:06:52] keeps us
[2:06:55] from knowing it.
[2:06:58] And somewhere the prophet says
[2:07:02] you were there in the attributes
[2:07:05] but you don't remember
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; because you are just a part of his life.
[2:07:15] So when he was writing our names
[2:07:20] the prophet says
[2:07:22] and that's the portion I want to read.
[2:07:27] He says here
[2:07:32] in the beginning
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; that's
[2:07:36] okay let me start here now that's where
[2:07:39] we were in the beginning
[2:07:43] you do not understand it now
[2:07:47] but you was back there in the beginning
[2:07:51] when God made man in his image
[2:07:55] he made him a theophile
[2:08:00] You see
[2:08:02] when he chose us in him
[2:08:05] he made us.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; So when we are looking at the lamb's
[2:08:12] book of life
[2:08:15] when he came to redeem
[2:08:18] he was redeeming the people that he
[2:08:19] chose in you.
[2:08:25] That's true.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Let's
[2:08:31] uh look at this.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; The prophet says,
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; you know, the prophet went beyond the
[2:08:40] curtain of time.
[2:08:45] Then he says,
[2:08:49] "Now with the lamp, with the book in his
[2:08:53] hands,
[2:08:55] That is page 103
[2:08:58] uh the bridge between seven church ages.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 252.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 252.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; He says
[2:09:05] we are ready
[2:09:07] to ask his grace and mercy upon us to
[2:09:11] open the seven seal book to us
[2:09:16] and let us look past the curtain of
[2:09:18] time.
[2:09:21] Amen.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Notice when he took the book
[2:09:30] the title did
[2:09:35] and he broke the seals of the mystery
[2:09:39] to bring to reveal them
[2:09:42] to bring them to his
[2:09:46] see all of his redeemed subjects.
[2:09:56] So it says
[2:10:00] redemption
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; is only for his subject
[2:10:06] that are written in the lamb's book of
[2:10:10] life.
[2:10:12] Hallelujah.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; So redemption is not for all.
[2:10:17] When you talk about the book of
[2:10:18] redemption,
[2:10:20] He's redeeming
[2:10:22] those that he wrote in the lamb's book
[2:10:26] of Christ before the foundation.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; He says,
[2:10:35] "But now he comes
[2:10:40] from here
[2:10:42] at this last seed.
[2:10:44] He is no more a mediator.
[2:10:49] You see, he was a mediator
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; when
[2:10:55] he stood
[2:10:58] to bring the people back into the lens
[2:11:00] book of
[2:11:03] those that overcome
[2:11:06] when he is done with that meritorial
[2:11:08] work
[2:11:10] he is king.
[2:11:14] You see the last message that the pastor
[2:11:16] preached pastor David
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; he brought this
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; that after the meritorial work
[2:11:25] when he now comes to collect his subject
[2:11:30] he comes as a king
[2:11:33] to collect the queen.
[2:11:42] He is king now. And what does he do if
[2:11:46] he is a king? He has to have subjects.
[2:11:51] And his subject
[2:11:53] is them that he has redeemed.
[2:11:57] So those that he redeemed from the
[2:12:00] lamb's book of life.
[2:12:03] He is a king to them
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; and they cannot come before him until he
[2:12:11] takes the right of redemption.
[2:12:17] He come to get his subject.
[2:12:21] Now to get his subject
[2:12:24] he revealed his secrets
[2:12:28] and the subject
[2:12:31] saw it.
[2:12:34] You see that's why
[2:12:37] we have two classes of people
[2:12:41] those that don't get the revelation
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; and those that get the revelation
[2:12:48] you see Peter
[2:12:50] the Lord Jesus said blessed are thou
[2:12:55] for it is my father that revealed this
[2:12:59] to me
[2:13:01] because he is in the lamb's book of life
[2:13:05] the father reveal his secret
[2:13:09] and he says upon this revelation
[2:13:12] of who Jesus Christ
[2:13:15] I will build my church and that rock
[2:13:19] is the revelation of who he is
[2:13:24] that's why he says those that overcome
[2:13:28] I will give them the white stone
[2:13:32] So the white stone, it's not for all
[2:13:36] those that overcome.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Can you read that scripture, my brother?
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; You found it.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Revelation 2 verse 17.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; He that has an ear, let him hear what
[2:13:58] the spirit saith unto the churches. To
[2:14:01] him that overcomemeth will I give to it
[2:14:04] of the hidden manner and will give him a
[2:14:07] white stone.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; You see?
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Him that overcometh.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; So that means the one that is
[2:14:15] transferred
[2:14:16] to the book of life
[2:14:18] of life that's the one that received the
[2:14:20] white stone.
[2:14:25] But the one that remains in the book of
[2:14:27] life
[2:14:29] no white stone.
[2:14:31] That one the prophet says
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; that one do not understand the secret
[2:14:40] of God.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; He says he revealed his secret
[2:14:47] and they saw it.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; So only the people from the lamb's book
[2:14:52] of life
[2:14:55] see this secret.
[2:14:57] Amen.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Now when when he stood up,
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; there's this part that the pastor read
[2:15:08] to us and it was a beautiful part.
[2:15:14] You see, he says, listen what a jubilee
[2:15:18] going on.
[2:15:20] When they seen that lamp
[2:15:24] and take that book of redemption,
[2:15:27] their souls
[2:15:29] screamed out.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; There's a portion I think I I missed.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Let me just go back to my notes.
[2:15:47] It says page 99 here.
[2:15:53] God bless you.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Let me just move on. The time is not on
[2:16:06] my side.
[2:16:13] You see when
[2:16:23] when
[2:16:25] John
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; let's go to Revelation chapter 5 in
[2:16:28] closing
[2:16:36] verse four my brother
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; Revelation 5:4
[2:16:41] and I wept much because no man was found
[2:16:44] worthy to open and to read the book
[2:16:47] neither to look there on.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; It was so painful for John.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; He cried
[2:16:54] because he says there was no man
[2:16:57] worthy
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; found worthy
[2:17:02] open to read to look there.
[2:17:08] That's why the prophet says those that
[2:17:11] are in the lamb's book of life
[2:17:14] when the book is opened
[2:17:17] they saw it.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Now Jo wept
[2:17:24] when the book was closed
[2:17:27] and it said there was no man to open the
[2:17:29] book.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. But then as we move
[2:17:34] on,
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; verse seven, my brother,
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; verse seven, and he came and took the
[2:17:40] book out of the right hand of him that
[2:17:42] sat upon the throne.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says,
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; he is the one that wrote our names
[2:17:51] in the lamb's book of
[2:17:54] so he knew what was in the lamb's book
[2:17:56] of.
[2:17:58] So that's why he came forth.
[2:18:02] There was no other person that knew what
[2:18:06] was written in the lamp.
[2:18:09] The lamp knew.
[2:18:12] That's why it say he took the book
[2:18:13] within his
[2:18:17] then
[2:18:19] John
[2:18:21] the prophet says saw his name wrote
[2:18:25] there and he looked there in
[2:18:31] the prophet said he must have saw his
[2:18:33] name wrote there
[2:18:38] when the sins are broke
[2:18:40] you must see your name written.
[2:18:46] Then he says here
[2:18:50] talk about the jubilee
[2:18:52] talk about the time when the lamb walked
[2:18:56] forth. You see the book is even sealed
[2:18:59] in heaven.
[2:19:01] Now the mysteries are is my name there.
[2:19:07] You see when you go home ask yourself is
[2:19:11] my name in the book of life or in the
[2:19:14] lamb's book.
[2:19:16] So the mysteries are my name
[2:19:20] in the lamb's book.
[2:19:24] But if it is it was put on the book
[2:19:29] before the foundation.
[2:19:32] Amen.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Let me close with this.
[2:19:43] You see the prophet says
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; John has been standing there
[2:19:50] our brother crying
[2:19:54] everything
[2:19:56] in heaven
[2:19:58] everything in the earth everything in
[2:20:02] the sea had me holler Before
[2:20:07] he saw
[2:20:10] his name in the
[2:20:12] he was crying.
[2:20:15] But when the seals were broke,
[2:20:19] John must have looked in
[2:20:24] and seen
[2:20:26] past the curtain of Christ
[2:20:29] and said, "There is John."
[2:20:33] You see the prophet
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; his body was lying there
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; with a bald head.
[2:20:44] But when he went past the curtain of
[2:20:48] no bald head,
[2:20:52] [applause]
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; he even said,
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; "I will encourage you
[2:20:58] to keep your hair."
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the prophet
[2:21:07] went beyond the curtain of time
[2:21:11] because the prophet says
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; he was worried
[2:21:19] when you read the the book I'm just
[2:21:21] going to close with this.
[2:21:24] He says I was afraid to die
[2:21:28] because I didn't know what I will
[2:21:31] become. I know I was not lost
[2:21:35] but I knew
[2:21:37] I I didn't know whether I will become a
[2:21:40] spirit or a ghost and I will meet
[2:21:44] brother Negize
[2:21:46] him as a as a cloud man
[2:21:50] but he says when he went beyond the c of
[2:21:55] it helped him a lot
[2:21:58] now he was no longer afraid to die
[2:22:01] because beyond the
[2:22:03] he realized he is. Amen.
[2:22:08] Now
[2:22:11] the the mystery is my name. There
[2:22:16] he says talk about the hepit.
[2:22:20] You see we we must talk about the
[2:22:22] height.
[2:22:24] The height.
[2:22:26] When we were sitting here and the pastor
[2:22:29] was
[2:22:30] you see unveiling to us that we are in
[2:22:35] the lamb's book
[2:22:37] that WAS A HAPPY TIME everything in
[2:22:39] heaven.
[2:22:41] He must have re really cried out
[2:22:46] everything in heaven
[2:22:48] everything in the earth beneath the
[2:22:50] earth. every creation
[2:22:55] me say amen.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Blessings
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; and glory and wisdom and power and might
[2:23:06] belongs to him. Why will John say that
[2:23:10] the prophet says he must have seen
[2:23:13] another?
[2:23:16] You see when when the secret were
[2:23:19] revealed,
[2:23:20] you see because the prophet says,
[2:23:22] "Grieve not the Holy Spirit
[2:23:26] whereby you are sealed
[2:23:28] until the day of."
[2:23:31] You see, the day of redemption is when
[2:23:34] the secret
[2:23:36] is revealed and you will see the
[2:23:41] prophet says, "The day of redemption is
[2:23:44] when the book was open. And when the
[2:23:46] book was opened, John who did not grieve
[2:23:49] the Holy Spirit saw beyond the
[2:23:59] seal
[2:24:01] signifies
[2:24:03] a complete way.
[2:24:05] So you are sealed
[2:24:07] until the day of death.
[2:24:10] So while you are in the book of life,
[2:24:12] you are sealed. But if you grieve the
[2:24:14] Holy Spirit,
[2:24:17] you are blotted out. So you are sealed
[2:24:20] until the day of redemption. So when the
[2:24:24] the book of redemption is open
[2:24:28] just like John,
[2:24:30] you see beyond the
[2:24:33] you see your name
[2:24:35] of
[2:24:37] you know you are redeemed
[2:24:39] bless you.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Let us just say again my brother
[2:24:49] [applause] the day of redemption
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; then we will askinde to come forth.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; Be [singing]

[2:46:34] have surrendered their souls unto thee,
[2:46:36] Lord. Quite a number of people surrender
[2:46:39] their souls unto the devil. But you Lord
[2:46:43] Almighty so merciful that these [music]
[2:46:47] be able to surrender their souls unto
[2:46:49] thee to show that they have surrendered
[2:46:52] their souls, they are baptized in the
[2:46:55] name of our Lord Jesus Christ for the
[2:46:58] remission of their sins. Thank you
[2:47:00] father. We pray Lord as the brothers are
[2:47:03] going to baptize them [music] and they
[2:47:05] are also going to be baptized Lord there
[2:47:07] should be a meaningful thing Lord in
[2:47:09] their lives in Jesus Christ my Lord I
[2:47:12] pray. Amen and amen.

[2:47:22] Acts [music] chapter 2 from verse 36-39.
[2:47:27] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[2:47:29] know assuredly that God hath made that
[2:47:32] same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both
[2:47:35] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[2:47:38] this, they were pricked in their heart,
[2:47:40] and said unto Peter, and to the rest of
[2:47:42] the apostles, "Men and brethren, what
[2:47:45] shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them,
[2:47:48] "Repent and be baptized every one of you
[2:47:51] in the name of Jesus for the remission
[2:47:53] of sins, and ye shall receive the gift
[2:47:56] of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is
[2:47:58] unto you and to your children, and to
[2:48:01] all that are a far off, even as many as
[2:48:04] the Lord our God shall call.
[2:48:10] [music]
[2:48:20] I
[2:48:25] love [music]
[2:48:26] you.
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; I love [singing] you.
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; when
[2:48:43] you love
[2:48:46] [music]
[2:48:52] [music and singing]
[2:48:59] Christ.
[2:49:03] [applause]
[2:49:08] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:49:12] &gt;&gt; flowing
[2:49:15] [music and singing] flow.
[2:49:17] &gt;&gt; There's joy.
[2:49:18] &gt;&gt; Where [music]
[2:49:23] is joy?
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; There [music]
[2:49:28] is
[2:49:32] [music]
[2:49:34] the [singing]
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:49:46] [music]
[2:49:47] [singing]
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; We'll request our preacher that the
[2:49:52] Mercedes just to come and pray for them
[2:49:54] or just to pray for her. Amen.
[2:50:02] As we [music] close our eyes,
[2:50:07] gracious eternal heavenly father,
[2:50:11] the almighty God,
[2:50:15] we can never cease to thank you Lord.
[2:50:19] You are mighty in words. You are mighty
[2:50:21] in deeds.
[2:50:23] Our
[2:50:25] sister took a step
[2:50:29] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:50:31] Jesus Christ.
[2:50:35] We pray for her Lord God Almighty
[2:50:40] that you give her the new heart and the
[2:50:42] new spirit
[2:50:45] so that she can overcome
[2:50:49] the devil
[2:50:52] in all his tricks.
[2:50:56] Let our sister believe the word
[2:51:01] not the propaganda of the devil.
[2:51:07] We pray for her Lord God Almighty that
[2:51:09] you give her strength,
[2:51:12] courage and wisdom.
[2:51:16] When the Israelite left Egypt,
[2:51:20] it was not an easy journey.
[2:51:24] But the presence of the prophet Moses
[2:51:29] &gt;&gt; provided for them everything that they
[2:51:32] needed.
[2:51:36] We are under the ministry
[2:51:40] of the prophet William Brenham.
[2:51:44] Not only that,
[2:51:47] but we are also under the ministry
[2:51:50] that the Lord God Almighty gave to
[2:51:53] Pastor Israel.
[2:51:56] That should be enough
[2:51:59] for our sister to cross over into the
[2:52:02] promised land.
[2:52:04] We pray for her, Lord God Almighty.
[2:52:08] We pray for our elders. We pray for the
[2:52:10] church.
[2:52:12] We pray for our brothers that performed
[2:52:14] the baptism.
[2:52:17] It's not an easy thing
[2:52:20] to be a Baptist.
[2:52:23] But we are so glad Lord God Almighty
[2:52:27] that without tiring
[2:52:30] our brothers are always performing these
[2:52:32] duties.
[2:52:34] Give them strength. Give them courage.
[2:52:38] Most importantly Lord reveal the word
[2:52:40] unto us. Our elder will be departing
[2:52:44] going to the USA.
[2:52:46] Father, we just want to remember him in
[2:52:49] prayer.
[2:52:51] &gt;&gt; Bless him Lord. Give him strength,
[2:52:53] courage, and wisdom.
[2:52:55] We are still in great expectation
[2:52:58] that you will provide grace for him to
[2:53:01] return.
[2:53:03] We commit everything unto your hand. In
[2:53:06] the mighty name of our Lord and Savior
[2:53:08] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen.
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:53:19] Thank you so much, Bazalan.
[2:53:22] I just want to respect
[2:53:25] the sister who has been baptized because
[2:53:28] we thought we don't have a baptism,
[2:53:31] but God said no, she cannot be left
[2:53:33] behind.
[2:53:35] So, we just want to thank the Lord that
[2:53:38] God has done something to her. Amen.
[2:53:41] We are going to ask our brother just for
[2:53:43] two.
[2:53:45] We are going just to ask one song from
[2:53:47] our brother and then the church will be
[2:53:49] dismissed. Amen. God bless you all.
[2:53:53] Amen.
