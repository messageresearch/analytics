[10:04] god possessor of Heaven and Earth and
[10:07] blessed be the most high God which hath
[10:10] delivered thine enemies into thy hand

[10:53] evening uh we have come for the
[10:57] communion communion is
[11:02] a communion is a special
[11:08] service amen amen that's why it was not
[11:11] Ser to the
[11:15] public but to The
[11:19] Chosen even
[11:21] today commun is not taken by the
[11:26] public but it is taken by the
[11:30] it is
[11:32] revealed to The
[11:35] Chosen
[11:37] okay the pure in
[11:41] heart the body of
[11:44] Christ all right it is the body of
[11:49] Christ that can take the body of
[11:54] Christ is those Of The Bloodline of
[11:57] Christ
[12:00] who can take
[12:02] communion amen amen so that's why he
[12:06] calls us the
[12:08] body all right and I read
[12:14] here we have the prophet brother
[12:19] Bram amen so he tells us of this
[12:25] communion it's not really a preaching
[12:30] someone but I will read some few things
[12:32] and we take
[12:35] communion amen so we read the
[12:39] Bible that king
[12:44] of know in the
[12:46] Bible you will realize that not
[12:50] everybody has
[12:53] seen But
[12:56] Abraham and the seed of
[13:01] amen amen in the last
[13:04] days not everybody can
[13:07] see you know brother Bram
[13:10] says you need to
[13:14] meet and in the book again in that
[13:17] Hebrew
[13:19] Book he has asked a
[13:22] question saying have you ever met
[13:25] MC since the battle is over
[13:31] amen amen now uh now you ask you can ask
[13:35] yourself which
[13:38] battle he is talking
[13:40] about but
[13:43] thenc king
[13:45] of now you know every King has got some
[13:51] subjects and the people who serve under
[13:54] that
[13:56] King are called the subjects of the
[14:00] king amen amen and now I read some few
[14:05] things
[14:07] here from our
[14:11] Prophet um he
[14:15] says now before we go to take to the
[14:22] communion
[14:24] table the blood and the body of the Lord
[14:30] mixed with
[14:33] faith does the blood and the body mixed
[14:37] with
[14:41] faith the
[14:43] body okay
[14:46] I he that eats my
[14:50] flesh and drinks my
[14:53] blood has eternal
[14:57] life
[15:00] actually what he's saying
[15:02] is if you have eternal
[15:05] life you will eat his
[15:08] flesh and drink his
[15:11] blood if you have eternal
[15:16] life
[15:18] okay and now I read
[15:22] here it is MC who came to
[15:27] Abraham now brother
[15:29] says what what
[15:32] happened was
[15:35] that gave Abraham of
[15:40] himself because if God loves you he will
[15:44] give you of
[15:47] himself that is pure
[15:52] love did you hear it if God loves
[15:56] you he will give you
[16:02] he want you to become
[16:04] him all
[16:06] right but
[16:08] actually if we look into the
[16:14] Bible like the seventh
[16:19] seal the seal that is not for
[16:23] everybody no it's not to the public
[16:29] as he
[16:30] says then you'll
[16:32] wonder if it is not for
[16:36] public it's for
[16:39] whom because there's somebody who's not
[16:41] the
[16:43] public now if he
[16:45] says the seventh
[16:47] seal is not open to the
[16:53] public you know because you can't preach
[16:57] it he did he didn't preach
[16:59] it he revealed
[17:02] it you know so that is one of the
[17:08] things you should take note
[17:10] of that like he speaks about the third
[17:15] pool is the things that he didn't
[17:19] preach but he
[17:21] revealed now that's why when they open
[17:25] the seven
[17:26] seal when he opened the
[17:30] silent in
[17:33] heaven not not
[17:36] on and
[17:38] because he didn't preach
[17:42] it he opened
[17:45] it as we have said last Sunday I think
[17:48] you have heard that
[17:52] suay that things like the third
[17:55] pool he says it's not to the
[18:02] Now find the word what it
[18:05] means it's not for
[18:09] everybody so that's why some say it is
[18:13] not
[18:14] revealed it is not for
[18:17] [Music]
[18:19] everybody now the public don't know
[18:21] about
[18:22] it but there must be some people to whom
[18:26] he has revealed it
[18:29] not preached
[18:31] it opened unto
[18:34] them their
[18:36] secret because if it is a
[18:39] secret then it can be open to
[18:43] everybody special
[18:45] for this people
[18:50] ordained amen
[18:53] [Music]
[18:55] amen we have seen even in the Bible
[19:02] that in Genesis Genesis he
[19:07] says number one it was
[19:11] God
[19:13] Theos then the
[19:17] men all right amen
[19:21] so if he
[19:24] says some of the things in the
[19:27] Bible
[19:28] are not revealed to the
[19:35] public we are going to see here
[19:39] that this
[19:43] threefold and which is you are part of
[19:46] the
[19:49] threefold now if you are part of the
[19:51] threefold you are not the
[19:56] public the public
[19:58] is the person who are not part of the
[20:02] threefold mystery of
[20:07] God now do you know that you are part of
[20:10] the
[20:14] threefold that's why in the
[20:16] Bible as I was listening to brother Bram
[20:22] saying it was
[20:26] godos the man
[20:28] that is one
[20:31] thing amen amen now if I am not part of
[20:38] that then that would put me aside
[20:47] as now when he
[20:51] reveals it comes as brother bam says
[20:55] life comes in three
[21:01] if he reveals it comes in
[21:07] three that's why he spoke of Father Son
[21:10] and Holy
[21:12] Ghost but yet speaking of
[21:15] one which is God
[21:18] himself amen amen
[21:21] now we have seen enough of the
[21:26] public he says it's so many
[21:29] times not revealed to the
[21:35] public even
[21:40] tonight if you they have a Services
[21:44] service
[21:46] service you find so many
[21:50] people when it is music
[21:53] singing and just
[21:57] preaching just a
[21:59] message you find many
[22:02] people but when it
[22:05] comes where it is God
[22:09] himself taking the
[22:12] pit I am not
[22:14] God we
[22:16] but all together as we are gathered
[22:20] here we are one
[22:24] thing now we who are of
[22:29] him because he says he has given
[22:35] Abraham of
[22:39] himself if God has given
[22:42] us of
[22:46] himself that's why the prophet
[22:49] says then the Bible
[22:52] says when he made man he made him in his
[22:56] own
[23:00] image surely the people should look at
[23:04] the church and see the image of
[23:09] God the real Church of
[23:13] God image of
[23:15] God it's not just a
[23:18] church it should
[23:20] reflect God
[23:22] himself and if you see
[23:25] God he is a reflect
[23:31] reflection which one is
[23:34] reflect there is a
[23:37] reflector and the
[23:41] reflection between man and God which one
[23:45] is the
[23:47] reflector can somebody answer
[23:51] that
[23:56] reflector reflector what is the work of
[24:00] a
[24:03] [Music]
[24:05] reflector you have it on your
[24:08] car
[24:10] reflectors what is the work of the
[24:14] reflector because there's a
[24:22] reflector which part is the
[24:26] reflector
[24:29] I don't hear Brother that thing of
[24:32] your no volume there
[24:36] okay all
[24:39] right now brother speaks of
[24:43] that now I I'm still waiting for a
[24:48] answer the
[24:50] drivers what is a
[24:56] reflector
[24:58] put it put it on for me
[25:03] brother reflector and there's a
[25:08] reflector a
[25:12] reflection here is a piece of
[25:16] paper God bless you now brother speaks
[25:20] of
[25:22] that
[25:23] now he
[25:25] says he himself
[25:29] became part I mean he made us part of
[25:37] himself you know the world
[25:45] talking this brother is serving there
[25:47] this brother is serving there this
[25:48] brother is serving there but in
[25:52] Christ we worship in
[25:56] Christ
[25:58] no not not
[26:02] in or the old home no we worship
[26:07] where the true
[26:10] worshippers shall
[26:12] worship the
[26:15] father okay now he speaks of the
[26:19] true
[26:23] worshippers
[26:24] because they can reflect back
[26:30] to their
[26:32] creator who said let us make
[26:36] men in
[26:39] our
[26:42] image all right
[26:44] amen God didn't make a man somebody
[26:50] else but he made man in his
[26:56] own
[26:59] image that is the only image I
[27:05] know
[27:07] because even churches are like
[27:14] images like the pope can
[27:17] say Roman Catholic is my
[27:26] image a truth
[27:29] worshiper will worship God in
[27:33] truth and
[27:36] spirit in spirit and in
[27:40] truth but truth is the word of
[27:43] God that is
[27:48] revealed you know there's a word of God
[27:51] and they reveal the word of
[27:54] God there is a message the revealed
[27:59] message there is the bride and the
[28:02] revealed
[28:06] bride if it is not
[28:10] revealed it just remain as the
[28:15] word but if it is not
[28:18] revealed it is not talking about
[28:22] God it's it is called
[28:26] religion
[28:28] now religion and
[28:30] Christianity is two different
[28:34] things some people ask are you
[28:39] religious amen amen and say yeah I'm
[28:45] religious I go I I go to church every
[28:48] Sunday now all right let's finish here
[28:52] this is what the Lord has given
[28:55] us just to read here
[28:59] [Applause]
[29:00] uh this
[29:03] night this
[29:06] commun I'd like to explain says the
[29:12] prophet I'm sure the brother is
[29:15] still trying to find for
[29:18] me refle
[29:21] reflector or reflection
[29:25] and ref

[29:48] when there's a light amen yes to show
[29:51] there's a car that is on the other side
[29:54] all right amen okay that's that's why
[29:57] when go when God made you he made you
[30:02] what a reflector actually which one
[30:06] between God and man is a
[30:18] reflector I'm I'm waiting for the
[30:21] answer the brother is still praying
[30:25] there between
[30:27] reflector and
[30:31] reflection speaks about
[30:35] it all right
[30:38] am I wanted to hear from the church
[30:42] itself children of
[30:46] God
[30:48] reflector reflector it says men
[30:52] here you agree
[30:56] brother
[30:57] you
[30:58] agree say reflector
[31:03] reflector
[31:05] then an
[31:09] object
[31:12] okay the brother has
[31:15] answered let's carry let's leave it here
[31:17] and carry
[31:19] on all
[31:21] right uh what's on your car you call it
[31:25] what reflector
[31:31] reflector is it a
[31:34] reflector
[31:36] reflector what is the work of a
[31:39] reflector
[31:45] reflector is to give a
[31:49] sign that I'm going this way I'm going
[31:53] this way then it's a reflector
[31:59] you
[32:01] agree all
[32:04] right now I quot here they said the
[32:08] prophet and
[32:10] it's I think is this a few moments that
[32:15] the Lord has given
[32:17] us
[32:19] communion is to
[32:22] talk and it talks
[32:26] back
[32:28] that's why brother Bram
[32:31] says
[32:33] [Music]
[32:34] when
[32:37] MC met
[32:39] Abraham he gave
[32:42] him
[32:44] himself he gave him of
[32:48] himself is that right now listen to
[32:53] brother
[32:55] communion is to talk
[32:58] that's to
[33:00] commune and and it talks
[33:05] back something that you talk
[33:09] to and uh because communion is only
[33:13] taken by the bride of
[33:16] Christ the people whom he talks
[33:21] to and they talk back to
[33:25] him communion is not
[33:28] everywhere is
[33:30] between God and the people he will talk
[33:34] to and in they will talk back
[33:38] to so it's not taken by
[33:42] everybody is for those who can talk back
[33:45] to
[33:49] God if we can't talk back to
[33:53] God then we can't take
[33:55] communion
[33:59] and that's why we are
[34:02] here it's a sign that we have come we
[34:06] have heard
[34:08] him now we come to
[34:12] respond back to
[34:15] God that it is our
[34:19] agreement between us and God the real
[34:24] agreement you have
[34:27] is should it should be between you and
[34:35] God uh all
[34:39] right sometimes I I was I used to be an
[34:43] Assembly of God
[34:47] member we have had so many
[34:51] meetings like today there more
[34:55] meetings
[34:57] of men talking to another
[35:00] man than a
[35:02] meeting of men talking to
[35:08] God people would love to
[35:12] hear some people talking about
[35:16] God singing
[35:20] God for to hear God
[35:23] himself that's one they they cannot
[35:30] they they can
[35:33] tolerate to
[35:35] talk about
[35:37] God but they can't
[35:41] tolerate if God talks to
[35:46] them is that right now the difference
[35:50] here like brother says communion is to
[35:55] talk
[35:58] and and and it talks
[36:04] back if you talk and it doesn't talk
[36:12] backun that's why we here because we
[36:15] have he
[36:18] him and we
[36:21] also have talked
[36:24] back we have answered you
[36:27] we have
[36:29] [Applause]
[36:31] him those men are who followed the
[36:35] Samaritan
[36:37] woman they said to the Samaritan
[36:41] woman after they have met the Lord Jesus
[36:45] Christ
[36:47] woman thank you for your
[36:51] testimony but now we have heard
[36:55] him
[37:01] ourself that's
[37:03] communion we
[37:05] our we have him
[37:11] our have
[37:13] you have you heard
[37:16] him or you hear about
[37:18] him hear the people talking about you
[37:22] and have you heard him
[37:25] yourself
[37:28] because if you say that man says God is
[37:32] this and
[37:34] this you are not saying
[37:37] it you are carrying
[37:40] something of some from
[37:45] somebody I hear that they
[37:49] say a
[37:52] prophet amen amen but there's a there's
[37:56] some who says brother Bram is a prophet
[38:00] sent by
[38:03] God and somebody says I hear that is a
[38:09] prophet okay that's the difference there
[38:12] are some who used to come to
[38:16] worship I know of some with
[38:20] us who came to
[38:23] worship and today are here on
[38:29] YouTube and they're saying brother
[38:30] Brenham is a cult brother Bram is this
[38:33] and
[38:36] so but they worshiped with
[38:40] us even paid
[38:42] ties but they didn't
[38:48] meet and today the very same
[38:52] people who came to
[38:54] church and worship with
[38:57] us
[39:00] saying is a false
[39:04] prophet what is that they have never met
[39:09] God they have about
[39:15] you my brother do you know that
[39:21] scripture the Samaritan
[39:25] woman
[39:27] testified to this people you know the
[39:31] scripture yes read the
[39:35] scripture and then we are fin we are
[39:41] through John chapter 4
[39:44] yes uh from verse
[39:50] 29 come see a man which told me
[39:54] all things that ever I did that is the
[39:59] Samaritan
[40:00] woman see a man did what told me all
[40:06] things who told me she recognized the
[40:10] Lord because he told
[40:14] her all
[40:17] things I've been longing for such a
[40:23] message
[40:25] where
[40:27] the Lord will tell me all
[40:30] things I've been longing for such a
[40:35] fellowship you know people go to church
[40:38] they come back with
[40:43] half a small
[40:46] portion maybe
[40:48] among of all the that was
[40:52] pre what they have
[40:55] was
[40:57] Jesus was born in
[41:01] Bethlehem but now in the
[41:04] Bible this woman
[41:07] says come and
[41:09] see
[41:12] a he didn't say an angel a
[41:15] man you know you should find that man
[41:20] who can tell you all
[41:23] things a true Witness
[41:28] all right amen
[41:30] there preachers ordained every
[41:35] day
[41:37] okay but can we
[41:39] find
[41:41] one the one who can tell us all
[41:45] [Music]
[41:48] things I
[41:50] remember a brother
[41:53] complaining he went and met H he's a
[41:59] Elder and ask him a
[42:02] question scriptural
[42:06] question and he said to and the the
[42:09] pastor that Pastor said to this
[42:22] brother the brother is
[42:25] asking this man because he is a
[42:33] pastor he he
[42:38] called read the
[42:41] Bible now how can a
[42:44] shepher tell the
[42:47] Sheep go
[42:49] and because the shepherd don't
[42:53] know so he says today
[42:57] ship read the
[43:01] Bible but the Sheep expected to hear
[43:05] everything from the
[43:09] shepherd all right now let's we
[43:12] finishing with
[43:15] this
[43:18] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[43:23] man and drink his blood
[43:27] there is no
[43:30] life in
[43:33] you is the same
[43:35] scripture that one in
[43:38] Genesis showing
[43:40] that who is
[43:43] thisis in the New Testament here comes
[43:47] the same
[43:48] meis but now in the form as brother bam
[43:53] says MC became Jesus
[43:59] okay then
[44:02] finally when the
[44:07] prophet he preached to
[44:09] us and
[44:14] saided who became
[44:18] Jesus he came now as a
[44:24] prophet okay amen have you seen
[44:28] that then
[44:30] brother
[44:32] said I have I I am glad I met
[44:40] that then he says
[44:45] that Abraham met
[44:48] him when he was on the
[44:51] earth working and he says that milis
[44:56] became
[44:58] Jesus but at the end of time he speaks
[45:02] of
[45:04] MEC and
[45:07] saying he came as a
[45:12] prophet all right now
[45:15] because there's a body the word of God
[45:20] and his body of
[45:23] Flesh now the people who are PR
[45:28] are not
[45:30] confused because by by The
[45:35] Mask because he changes his
[45:40] mask now if you know him you don't know
[45:44] him by the mask that you looking
[45:49] at because he's an
[45:53] Insider so you that's why
[45:56] says you are an
[45:59] Insider
[46:01] Insider would know
[46:03] God not the
[46:07] frame because God is in a
[46:10] body now if you know
[46:12] him he says you are an
[46:19] Insider you take it
[46:22] online you take it online
[46:26] because if he is in the body he will be
[46:30] received in the
[46:32] body now there's something in your
[46:36] body this body that I'm looking
[46:39] at but there's something in in that
[46:42] body that can see something in that
[46:48] body that's why the Samaritan
[46:53] woman says she was waiting for that word
[46:59] to be made
[47:02] flesh so she was walking
[47:04] around saying I know Messiah coming and
[47:09] when he is come he will tell us all
[47:12] things now this woman she was not
[47:16] waiting just for the
[47:18] gospel she was waiting for the man who
[47:22] tell her all
[47:24] things person who wants to hear all
[47:28] things is believing he has
[47:32] believed to all
[47:35] things which is
[47:38] God he expected to hear all
[47:43] things okay now as we are going to take
[47:49] communion that's why we are
[47:51] saying it
[47:53] says let me read this
[47:57] communion to talk to
[48:01] talk and it talks
[48:05] back if you talk it doesn't talk back
[48:08] it's
[48:12] not then he says something that you talk
[48:18] to the very
[48:20] communion means to talk
[48:24] to
[48:28] that's why you say you have come for
[48:32] communion
[48:35] right if then it is not by
[48:40] Revelation that's why some they take it
[48:43] they take the cool
[48:47] drink because it is not by
[48:53] revelation we met some in Vendor
[48:58] somewhere we met
[49:00] some and they just
[49:04] Ser this cold drink they buy from the
[49:10] shop I don't know what it is
[49:14] called
[49:16] uh grape juice grape juice grap juice
[49:21] amen then we were there with some
[49:24] brothers they talked about saving the
[49:30] communion that was just grape juice
[49:33] grape
[49:34] juice now I don't believe great juice
[49:38] can uh
[49:44] reflect the blood of
[49:48] Christ but the Bible says that
[49:52] was in in our language all right let me
[49:56] leave it in our
[49:58] language but in
[50:01] Jerusalem it was
[50:07] made was that
[50:22] brother all right
[50:28] Prophet a reflector of
[50:31] God God bless
[50:34] you it says the
[50:36] prophet a
[50:39] reflector of
[50:41] God all right now we have it we'll use
[50:45] it
[50:48] again the last thing
[50:51] here let's take this last thing
[50:54] here
[50:56] in this book
[50:58] communion communion is to
[51:02] talk and it
[51:04] talks
[51:06] back meaning if he doesn't talk back
[51:12] notun something that you talk
[51:16] to like if we talk to
[51:19] God then God should talk back to
[51:24] us
[51:26] all right now the very word
[51:31] commune means to
[51:36] talk or be
[51:41] associated with
[51:43] something that toen back to
[51:49] you all
[51:52] right I I will finish here
[51:57] can you talk to somebody who doesn't
[51:59] talk back to
[52:03] you
[52:07] no can you worship a
[52:10] God who doesn't answer you who doesn't
[52:14] talk back to
[52:17] you okay in many cases don't answer the
[52:23] people because of their
[52:28] sin it is so in the
[52:31] Bible but we we should really become
[52:37] Christians in this manner a real
[52:41] Christian can talk to God God can talk
[52:45] back
[52:48] to not just keep
[52:50] talking there is no
[52:53] response real Christian
[52:56] somebody who talks to God and God talks
[52:59] back to
[53:00] [Music]
[53:02] him all
[53:05] right like brother
[53:07] Bram he could talk to
[53:10] God and God
[53:14] in back to
[53:16] him then he
[53:19] brings to ask the
[53:22] [Music]
[53:23] people they the the
[53:27] revelation of God not the
[53:31] preaching now don't mix Revelation with
[53:35] preaching preaching
[53:38] worldwide
[53:40] preaching one says this is revealed one
[53:42] says now what we need is the
[53:47] Revelation that's why the Bible says
[53:50] when he opened the seven
[53:54] SE not when he preached
[53:57] it because the seals are
[54:02] revealed are not
[54:05] preached if you expect somebody to
[54:08] preach the
[54:09] seals know that the seals are revealed
[54:13] when he
[54:15] opened the seventh seal not when he
[54:18] preached the seven and people are
[54:21] expecting him to preach the
[54:24] seventh
[54:26] but it's a
[54:28] revelation not a
[54:30] preaching it's not even a
[54:33] teaching if something is revealed to
[54:38] you it is revealed to you and you have
[54:43] received it by
[54:46] Revelation not by
[54:51] explanation that's why people are expl
[54:54] are the they are looking for
[54:58] explanation and then somebody says oh
[55:01] yeah I see it like
[55:05] this but in God it's not I see it like
[55:10] this no it's what is
[55:14] [Music]
[55:15] revealed what is revealed to you is
[55:19] unlike what is
[55:24] taught okay that's why the Bible says
[55:28] when he
[55:30] opened not when he
[55:32] preached it must be
[55:36] open right that's why he open that to
[55:43] Abraham when he gave
[55:45] him of
[55:49] himself called it
[55:53] communion because
[55:55] Abraham was able to talk to to
[56:02] MCC to
[56:05] AB now I'll tell you this
[56:08] now it is like this I was listening to
[56:12] brother
[56:14] Bram
[56:18] saying
[56:20] today can you can you hear MC today
[56:26] can you
[56:32] receive all
[56:34] right that's why he
[56:37] says who is this
[56:43] MEC and he
[56:45] says I am
[56:50] glad he could
[56:53] it
[56:57] sorry something in
[57:03] me brother says something in
[57:13] [Music]
[57:14] him and the people are still looking for
[57:21] MEC but when he brings it he says you
[57:26] too must
[57:30] meet he was
[57:33] God he
[57:35] became
[57:37] Jesus and he
[57:39] came as a
[57:42] prophet that is what we
[57:45] read okay amen now the
[57:48] Insiders as
[57:50] brother he says I'm glad that something
[57:55] in
[57:56] me now he doesn't say I he say something
[58:01] in
[58:06] me all
[58:09] right you to if something in you
[58:14] met you can say
[58:16] it something in
[58:22] you because there's a way
[58:25] and the revealed
[58:27] word now most of the people hear the
[58:32] word we never had the revealed
[58:37] word that's the
[58:40] difference is it revealed or is it just
[58:44] the
[58:46] way because everybody can say
[58:50] God but you ask
[58:52] them who is God
[58:55] then you'll see the
[58:59] difference God bless
[59:01] you
[59:04] as the deons let me read this and the
[59:07] deons will prepare
[59:12] here
[59:14] talk to
[59:18] God
[59:21] right I remember last Sunday
[59:27] when I was supposed
[59:29] to get ready for the
[59:34] service I had a problem with my
[59:41] leg but since now there was this in my
[59:49] mind now not the
[59:51] head no your your your mind
[59:56] inside
[59:59] that the children of God are waiting for
[1:00:02] they are waiting there they are in the
[1:00:08] Tabernacle now I must go to the
[1:00:14] Tabernacle I told the children of
[1:00:18] God then
[1:00:20] I I look for
[1:00:22] a I don't know what they call it
[1:00:25] that they give to the people who have
[1:00:28] have some problems with
[1:00:34] legs I look for one
[1:00:37] home
[1:00:39] amen all right and I tried it I said I
[1:00:44] do this be able to stand up and
[1:00:50] preach
[1:00:52] then I I I I
[1:00:55] thought but I haven't spoken to
[1:01:00] God about
[1:01:02] it I'm just doing
[1:01:05] things if if this leg is painful I won't
[1:01:09] go to service if this is I won't do
[1:01:14] that now I said now I've been talking
[1:01:19] alone then I decided to talk to
[1:01:23] God
[1:01:27] because it was like I am talking to
[1:01:31] myself and nothing was
[1:01:33] happening I'm talking to
[1:01:36] myself that this leg of mine I don't
[1:01:39] know whether to phone the elders at the
[1:01:43] church maybe do something I can't come
[1:01:45] to church but I decided I I something
[1:01:49] came to me that you are talking
[1:01:53] alone
[1:01:56] have you approached
[1:01:59] God because this thing is
[1:02:07] concerning I took off
[1:02:10] that I put on a
[1:02:13] normal I went to the service and I was
[1:02:21] fine you know sometimes it happens to
[1:02:26] you you put God
[1:02:28] aside and struggle to say now what am I
[1:02:31] going to
[1:02:32] do what should they do when things are
[1:02:37] [Applause]
[1:02:39] this but if you can turn
[1:02:42] around talk to
[1:02:45] him something will
[1:02:48] happen
[1:02:50] amen I was talking to a brother right
[1:02:53] now
[1:02:55] that even this
[1:02:59] morning when did we arrive here
[1:03:02] today yesterday
[1:03:05] yesterday
[1:03:07] oh
[1:03:09] yesterday brother I'm telling you the
[1:03:11] truth before
[1:03:16] God it has become a
[1:03:20] habit when I'm about to go to the
[1:03:23] service something
[1:03:27] happens but after I realized that it has
[1:03:31] become a
[1:03:34] habit I started to check with the word
[1:03:38] of
[1:03:39] God and I
[1:03:43] commun mes
[1:03:46] said God this people are not
[1:03:51] mine when God told him to go
[1:03:55] so he said no these people are not
[1:03:59] me so
[1:04:02] if you are not with
[1:04:07] us we won't
[1:04:10] go mes said
[1:04:13] Lord

[1:04:27] you say brother I can't hear you unless
[1:04:30] your presence go unless your
[1:04:34] presence go with
[1:04:38] us Moses was refusing to go without
[1:04:44] God he said we won't read now he said

[1:04:52] people now unless your
[1:04:55] presence with
[1:04:58] us let us remain
[1:05:03] here if we we were we could learn
[1:05:07] that if your
[1:05:09] presence not go with us mes said then
[1:05:14] let us remain
[1:05:18] here Moses meant that he can't tolerate
[1:05:21] such a
[1:05:23] situation
[1:05:25] to lead the
[1:05:26] people without God's
[1:05:31] presence okay let us all learn

[1:06:05] flight with the other
[1:06:10] flights but if we are in a
[1:06:13] flight and we are going like as we are
[1:06:16] coming

[1:10:48] scripture Matthews chapter
[1:10:52] 26 from verse
[1:10:56] 26 and as they were eating Jesus Took
[1:10:59] bread and blessed it and break it and
[1:11:03] gave it to the disciples and said take
[1:11:06] it this is my body and he took the cup
[1:11:10] and gave thanks and gave it to them
[1:11:12] saying drink ye all of it for this is my
[1:11:17] blood of the new testament which is
[1:11:19] shared for many for the remission of
[1:11:22] sins but as say unto you I will not
[1:11:25] drink henceforth of this fruit of the
[1:11:27] vine until that day when I drink it new
[1:11:31] with you in my father's
[1:11:33] Kingdom amen
[1:11:36] amen we started by
[1:11:39] taking
[1:11:42] bread let us
[1:11:45] pray our heavenly father we come to
[1:11:50] thee knowing that Lord Lord you are our
[1:11:56] savior your own blood was
[1:11:59] shed so father is to
[1:12:03] bring your own
[1:12:05] bloodline we believe that we are the
[1:12:08] blood
[1:12:10] bloodline of the most holy
[1:12:12] God that's why you have made yourself
[1:12:16] known to
[1:12:17] us even when you sent the
[1:12:21] prophet father to come come to open the
[1:12:25] seals to the
[1:12:28] bloodline everything that you did you
[1:12:31] did through the
[1:12:33] bloodline in the Pyramid
[1:12:36] of seven
[1:12:39] churches you came through the seven
[1:12:42] churches up to the end and we are glad
[1:12:47] Lord we see that we are at the
[1:12:51] end this is the last
[1:12:54] group as brother bam
[1:12:56] says the L people to
[1:13:00] be taken
[1:13:03] up in the twinkling of an
[1:13:06] eye and we believe father as we are
[1:13:09] standing here one
[1:13:11] day there will come a
[1:13:14] day when we shall be taken
[1:13:18] up we are expecting that we don't only
[1:13:21] read about these things but they are
[1:13:25] already in us and we are expecting that
[1:13:29] one
[1:13:30] day the world will never see us again we
[1:13:34] are so glad the signs are there every
[1:13:39] sign that was predicted by the Lord
[1:13:42] Jesus
[1:13:43] Christ can be seen by those who have
[1:13:46] heard
