========================================
[Music] we went on wake up [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] please [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh we greet you again in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ this evening um it's very very cold amen amen but it's also very very hot foreign [Music] so great I see that is seen as done the one that's without them okay we thank the Lord for another opportunity and I'm good I'm just going to present something for to uh lay a carpet for tomorrow and this is sir I'm conscious of the conditions we have elderly people among us and this is now I just want to put some encouraging them also that we want prolong the service but let all the according to his will and if there will be a tomorrow then what we are going to read for some few minutes that will uh prepare us for tomorrow if there will be a tomorrow in the Lord foreign and after the prophet has preached we cannot start something else because when he left he said what dude he said here is the secret I'm going to read it tomorrow the weight is in the bride it is amen because a messenger is somebody who is sent with a message to deliver it and after uh Elias delivered the message to Rebecca is so they started together with Rebecca following Elias Isaac when they arrived for Isaac was foreign you know and marriage started in the garden and yeah when God separated the woman from the men it was in the garden um and we see the Lord doing the same thing with Rebecca and Isaac because Isaac was in the field yes when when Rebecca saw Isaac Isaac was meditating in the field and when Elias are picked up Rebecca it was in the evening so with types the whole thing amen so now that's why now Rebecca was led to Isaac and Isaac eliasa could not leave Rebecca until Rebecca saw Isaac yes a man so brother Brennan our Alias away he came with the bride until he said whatever when he said senses this is the time at the time and said Christ The Mystery of God revealed and when the bride saw that not the church when the bride saw that um God took him because the message was now in the bridge so a messenger brings the message to the bride he won't live until they miss that message is in the bright now let's turn to a description again we are just online yes to send the name until tomorrow uh after we will be going after these golden nuggets we want to worship The God Who is in US amen amen and the peoples of this uh special conference here under trying conditions is to put credit to is to um is in US amen you will never find God around them ourselves God was found in his in the temple and he says is the place where God has a place God has has chosen he fell from porn to place his throne amen amen and tomorrow if tomorrow the Lord willing [Music] I want we we will look at the third Throne mystery says where God is we don't want to worship or a God who is in somebody else and he is not in us we don't want to worship the god of somebody else we want to worship God that is in US let us pray for the reading of the way Heavenly Father we are so thankful under this trying conditions amen but yet father you allowed it to be the way it is amen knowing that your people will still yet come and sit here yeah and listen to the word that you have promised them in these last days amen father just keep them warm father and we believe that what you are what is in store for us right now was prepared for us for this time amen and we believe it will put something in our hearts that will put this coldness out of our physical yeah I pray father that God will help us and I heal the people as we are here for and the brother Branham says the word of God Is A Healer amen and I've seen many people getting healed just by receiving the word from the pulpit rather than coming on a prayer line yes I pray father that you'll bless our people Bless The Messengers that are here the people we have put responsibility amen upon that they will preach the word in this area and elsewhere and abroad yes and we believe further that the devil is against this Revelation yes of God of the seventh seal amen but we believe father that is been like that even in the beginning from the beginning amen and I pray father that will bless us and heal us as we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen let's just open Ephesians chapter 1 verse foreign that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might maybe start from verse 9 if if possible having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had peoples in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on Earth even in him from there foreign you may be seated God bless you we will just put uh to the same message a text yes our text will be the last sign all right as it says he will put now together you know this morning we've seen God and men were one day and God and men one here the whole thing because in the Garden of Eden what the enemy did was to separate men from a union with God is so that men would be conscious of the existence of God but without any Union as I'm listening to the Servants of God here is that they are talking of a God who should be in you foreign uh in the book the inner Veil he says he does he is not waiting for another uh Revival if I could I could code it very well but he says it is Sunday to Sunday meaning God is in him Sunday to Sunday amen amen so you don't wait for him on Sunday first day to the first day okay amen now I will look at it we are still having the same preaching we are still on the same line I [Music] I want to read one part here at the dispensation of time he will bring together what's in heaven and on Earth together amen so men would no longer look up to heaven for something because all that was hidden in heaven will be together with that's on Earth amen so as it was God and we were all in him at the end he shall again put together because we were together amen [Music] so God just processed us as attributes and to shine forth as they reflectors to give light the who can reflect the reflection which is God that's what he has a a brought us here for you a God didn't bring us to Earth to suffer he brought us to to the Earth to shine forth as the Stars you know I I always repeat the same thing that when God after I created things he wanted somebody to appreciate um God wanted to express himself he he wanted to spread himself so that day he he is there all and in in all as the Bible says he wanted to be in a flower in a bed he wanted every living thing to express him saw each one of us should they have him in his heart that's why now the expression is when one says it is revealed the other one says amen so it's just an expression of who he is because you know today to us he is this one he is the one who this is uh you know I'm gonna call things you know and we are amen I wish you we could speak about that even in time that is Page 41 years he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals amen amen so which which one are you talking of today you're talking about Jesus yes which one now we're talking about Christ today yes because of Christ was in the body called Jesus which is the temple of God Jesus amen amen you know um I was somewhere abroad the question was like this The Book of Mark 13. while holding on this let me just quote it here because I'm talking to the Seed of Abraham amen amen so God said of Abraham shall I hide anything from Abraham amen God cannot hide this secret to you I don't want a god whom who will make me to doubt some other things it is a revealed or not amen I won't worship such a God I worship a God who comes and reveals himself amen amen amen not the one who will put some questions and answers in me why also begging me boss so then I will keep on waiting for somebody to deceive me The Book of Mark Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of that day and that our North new men no not the Angels who are in heaven neither the son but the father now the question was he is the question is the Bible says the Bible even the son don't know [Music] let me I want to thank God amen who revealed these things to us even the son don't know you know if it it cuts up in a mind of a canal man keep on saying yeah even the son don't know without any answer uh just like God that Brenham says God opened the seventh and said nothing now should it drop in the canal mind in a way he will even rejoice it that no nobody knows let me read it to you brother Branham says God said nothing amen so it ends up there God said okay amen then I asked him yes God said nothing himself but he said something amen amen he God spoke through brother so that if you are trying to listen up there God says You must you must come down to the man amen amen and then you'll hear something because God now has spoken through this one amen so if you need the spokesman of God if there's a king and then sometimes you go there you want to talk to the king or you want to hear from the King okay they'll tell you that you see the spokesman of the king is [Applause] the spokesman of the king he will take from the King amen amen so you can't say the king said nothing um [Applause] you'll be arrested amen because the King has spoken through his spokesman now to say the King has said nothing is under to undermine the king amen all right amen meaning that don't try to listen from thinking you'll get it from update you should receive it from this one yeah [Applause] because that one has posted it to this one so he has posted it from himself to Adam what did God say go to Adam [Applause] all right amen amen this is your seventh seal uh amen okay now here I am I need something here um we we write efficiency uh okay I think I was looking for this one elsewhere here before we go back to this let's read this one he is the one who opened those cells now remember he opened the seals and he said nothing he just he just opened after opening did you hear him saying something and then no but you've got this book here containing what he has said amen foreign amen but when when it was in his and it was not in the form of a book like this that was the Revelation he kept the right hand means the Majesty is well after he has given it to the Man they need materialized into a book form like this okay amen and he is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ amen not not a sermon but the whole world is Christ it's very a difference to from hearing from God the word of God or a sermon preached by Amen to they preach Christ amen not not just as someone Paul says I preach Christ amen and it says it and Christ is the seals that was opened oh amen who is he today um that were opened now can he be success we are not preaching Christ you are preaching amen but because he is not the six years he is the Seven Seals that were revealed amen oh my God that's why we can't be confused amen was to reveal Christ where is our our gay all right amen why the prophet speaks of Christ the mystery Christ he doesn't say Jesus the mystery but Christ who Christ because we we're going back yes God he was like a rainbow then he condescended into theophany is or you say it's the beginning of he says it is the beginning of the creation he says when you look at the theophany in the form of a man [Applause] it was not yet flesh it was the word in the form of amenities when Moses saw him so this history and it looked like a man amen when you die when you die it is this body that dies and the Bible says we shall change from mortality to immortality benef [Music] the body that can't eat um can't touch it it is in a body form water which was the beginning of the creation amen this was the format we we we we we we were shown how a book The spoken note was made in Congo now it comes a format a format before it comes out in a book amen everything comes through a certain format even with our tips some of them would not play through a certain system because of a different format yeah just like we as we are you are made differently you can play the seven seal is not revealed to a certain machine [Music] amen amen but you can't play that through a certain format a certain machine I think if I come with it is not revealed candies yeah you won't accept me I'll show you because it's another type of performance it was not made for this machine yes and we end up again it is like this uh yeah I come to men again awkward and the makeup will be but now listen my medicine it says it Here We call we shall say it's heaven when God dwells and here is now we must know that uh the Earth is not the world amen okay let me look at it yeah uh both which are in heaven and which are on earth now it doesn't say in the world because the world is a systematic and the Earth is the Earth amen amen I'm standing here on the Earth this political systems but now it is the earth now when God brought down Adam the spirit um he brought that Spirit into the Earth Down to Earth because Adam was Adam part of the earth you read the future room it tells you that Jesus was part of the earth oh yes oh man I I I can find it for you yeah Jesus was part of the earth and you also are you are part of the Earth that is your your body now it says it uh the seventh seal if you understand brings him brings him which all right let's go back to this the party You Came the reason you be we be we were born Sinners he says because we have bypassed this place God brought us down to the Earth to be tested and amen amen but now at the end of time he brings Christ who Christ to the Earth amen Jesus Oh yes okay amen the god the man the body of God Jesus is the body of God oh yes the god whom you seek Lord take on him shall come to his Temple now that Temple was Jesus God was in Jesus to reconcile the world unto him amen amen soil that means the seventh seal if you understand brings Christ is a mystery is the Revelation that brings Christ who cries to him now that Earth is you hello he can't bring it to this Earth because it should be the Earth just like he brought Adam to the edge was just the Earth dropped into it then it started to talk and walk amen amen when the seven civils dropped he started to walk like God to talk like that because now he has and now they are one here would probably means hey it speaks for itself amen that's the third pool you can say to this mountain movement amen you can say this we went somewhere with the um a young sister a devil worshiper and she had the hair um best certificate amen first couldn't find it a home affairs and a prophecy came as Prophet when I was told that this young sister yeah birth certificate is somewhere somewhere when you die amen amen and she knows so when I approach it and spoke to him God is that we agitated and I and said deity you when I'm told that your birth certificate is held down at the damn thing he bring up I will explain that one day because of your uh uh what's name your Satanism activities [Music] when she was born old her grandmother connected her to amen [Music] and he came back with the souls we'll talk about that those that were in locked there she went there he came back and Revelation 1 tells us yes when John saw him at the Isle of Patmos he said to John I was dating in my life and have the keys went to take the kids he had to die first order to go down amen the Lord will give us time to talk about it because one key he gave to Peter yes and said I give you the Keys of the Kingdom but there was another kiss did this that way in the hands of luciferous because Lucifer was the right-hand man of God so he was down there with the keys and the Lord Jesus knew that he has to go down amen amen he put on it was God himself he has just put on them the body of men in order to die and when he died and he said father receive my spirit um and the soul went down amen amen and he went down to take the keys is without the keys foreign [Applause] the certificate was found yes amen amen the very same computers that could not produce that certificate when they went back to the computers amen amen because we went today and and some things happened so we'll talk about it let's look at this amen he is the the the the seals that were opened um it even makes no sense to say it is not revealed today he is the seals that were revealed amen okay amen now let's look at it here right now let me run quickly let me just talk let me talk amen page five oh one page five four one of the seals 501 uh five I will just quickly read to you this is um who am I amen where is it 501 541 we must remember that this seventh seal Health in understand is the end of time of all things amen foreign I'm not getting any answer from that so it's just it is not revealed I literally no when is it gonna be released our children if the seventh is not revealed um are not revealed then amen amen no let's look at it the seventh seal is the end of all things the things written in the seal books build up reveals what was there is so before the foundation of the world it reveals what was amen okay amen it's it's it's it's it's very and it is the end first panel it is the end it is the end of struggling world uh this is the end of struggling nature is the end of everything it is the end of the uh it means uh oh my you can read on and on on everything runs out in at this time in this time at the end of this seventh seventh so end of church age the end of the seventh seal um so it's the end of all these things because you know what happened then if we go to page I think page 93 um it speaks of this now but now and verbal the seventh seal of redemption that the Lord the lamb took within himself yeah amen it is cold but yeah the Lord the Bible says um I would put like this amen all right we are through here we're going to read that it says it brings Christ into you amen you know Jesus yes you can you know Jesus everybody could accept Jesus but not Christ even the Jews they were satisfied at the name Jesus being Jesus amen to they never persecuted anybody for calling Jesus Jesus for calling him Christ what a woman are you aware of that amen today for calling him the seventh seal between understand because he should let me do it like this here is the uh the the book of redemption that the lamp took within himself within himself didn't Jesus say the father is in me amen when asked show us your father he says the father is in me um amen now if their father is in him where is the truth amen all right amen maybe I've got the book for you here I can quickly refer to it ending that is if not we'll see it later he says the prophet of God amen amen because he was sent through him God revealed these things no problem I'll read it to you I amen the prophet says you know some of them maybe have got the book since we started things the first Throne was in heaven yes it's second in Jesus the third in the man is okay now the first throne in heaven and he condescended was aware the second throne in Jesus and Jesus said the father is in me so the second Throne was in him so the book was on the one said on the throne the one that sat on the throne is this one in Jesus amen amen all right this is what this ministry has come to reveal so that's why it says took the book within himself amen amen and and today she speaks of foreign [Music] if he doesn't say anything from the throne don't accept it is not from his throne then he continues to say now with the lamp with the book in his hand then what he says we are ready to ask his grace and mercy upon us to open foreign look let me repeat to you again John the Baptist foreign introduced him to the Jews then at the end time his brother is Elijah the seventh messenger um standing in the camp um he's in the game between Time and Eternity all right amen now if you introduce eternity what do you see [Music]
