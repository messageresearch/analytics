[1:37:00] Amen. So
[1:37:03] uh I want to give you that program of
[1:37:07] today. The sermon will be so short.
[1:37:12] Yeah. Amen. So let's just sing that
[1:37:16] song.
[1:37:19] They're saying you are just
[1:37:21] easy or he leads them along the way can
[1:37:24] be settled. Amen. Amen.

[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:36] Amen.
[1:39:39] As we bow our
[1:39:41] heads and
[1:39:45] ask pray for the reading of the word.
[1:39:51] Amen. Amen.
[1:40:14] Garden of
[1:40:29] Eden. We make a
[1:40:33] vow.
[1:40:38] Here's your before
[1:40:41] us. May your angel that always talk to
[1:40:45] us, we believe you already released that
[1:40:51] angel through our brother.
[1:41:23] Because we know the very same angel that
[1:41:27] always come
[1:41:29] here as the pastor has appointed one of
[1:41:33] our
[1:41:35] elders. I still
[1:41:45] remember when the pastor sent one of our
[1:41:49] elit. He send that angel with
[1:41:56] the
[1:42:05] am we pray in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:42:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:42:13] As we open our
[1:42:15] Bible, the book of Revelation chapter
[1:42:19] 21, we will read from verse one
[1:42:23] until 3. Revelation 21 from verse 1 to
[1:42:29] three. And I saw a new heaven and a new
[1:42:32] earth, for the first heaven and the
[1:42:35] first earth were passed away, and there
[1:42:38] was no more sea. And I, John, saw the
[1:42:41] holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down
[1:42:44] from God out of heaven, prepared as a
[1:42:47] bride adorned for her husband. And I
[1:42:50] heard a great voice out of heaven,
[1:42:52] saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God
[1:42:55] is with men, and he will dwell with
[1:42:57] them, and they shall be his people, and
[1:43:01] God himself shall be with them, and be
[1:43:03] their God." Amen. Amen. You may be
[1:43:06] seated.
[1:43:12] Um my title this
[1:43:16] morning will be from verse
[1:43:21] three where it says the tabernacle of
[1:43:25] God is with
[1:43:26] men but we started from verse
[1:43:30] one for a good
[1:43:33] understanding. Amen. Amen. Before we
[1:43:36] start, I just received a call this
[1:43:40] morning good
[1:43:42] news
[1:43:44] from our elder that
[1:43:49] side was just telling me that they are
[1:43:53] baptizing people that area.
[1:43:57] I was very much
[1:43:58] happy
[1:44:00] because I I normally say it when you get
[1:44:04] to the area. You can baptize many people
[1:44:08] but not
[1:44:09] all we will
[1:44:11] remain. I normally say those that will
[1:44:15] remain become the base of the
[1:44:18] area upon that
[1:44:20] base others will come. So others are
[1:44:23] coming.
[1:44:25] is
[1:44:26] growing. God bless
[1:44:28] them. Amen. Amen. I remember when when
[1:44:33] we start the word of God in
[1:44:40] in said to me, the thing in
[1:44:44] Lord is the one that brought us here. So
[1:44:49] we we want it here.
[1:44:52] Amen. Amen. After we have a church
[1:44:56] there, somebody whipped me a
[1:44:59] lot like what are you trying to do? This
[1:45:04] thing is not going to work here. Then I
[1:45:06] said it's going to work. It's working
[1:45:10] because God said
[1:45:11] so. You cannot stop
[1:45:13] God. Try to fight God. You will be
[1:45:17] committing
[1:45:19] suicide. Just follow God.
[1:45:22] Amen. Amen. Where he leads me, I
[1:45:25] will not worry about the challenges of
[1:45:30] life. Brother Brenham said are there to
[1:45:35] strengthen you. When the when the
[1:45:38] wind is shaking the
[1:45:42] tree, the roots are going
[1:45:45] deeper and it becomes more
[1:45:47] strong. When the challenges of life
[1:45:52] comes your way unto the
[1:45:55] Lord because you are getting
[1:46:00] stronger. Amen. Amen. So let's get back
[1:46:04] to our
[1:46:06] title. Tabernacle of God is with
[1:46:11] me and my subtitle will be the cycle of
[1:46:15] eternity.
[1:46:18] Last few weeks I was visiting the sister
[1:46:21] churches
[1:46:25] in sharing about the word of God and
[1:46:28] then today we are here we will
[1:46:31] continue because the people that know
[1:46:35] says the history repeat itself.
[1:46:40] Amen. Amen. If there are people in the
[1:46:43] Bible that they lived a certain kind of
[1:46:47] life are here today to live like unto
[1:46:51] them. Amen. Amen. So you can do yourself
[1:46:54] a
[1:46:57] favor. Choose the character in the
[1:47:02] Bible. Amen. Amen. Brother Brenham
[1:47:05] says we live at the backside of the
[1:47:09] Bible.
[1:47:11] When the seventh seal
[1:47:13] open, when it known unto the
[1:47:15] people, the Bible becomes a new
[1:47:19] book. We can write a Bible about you.
[1:47:24] You can we can write a Bible about
[1:47:27] you because the Bible was written based
[1:47:31] on the life of the
[1:47:34] saints. If you are a saint today, you
[1:47:38] perfectly fit in the
[1:47:40] Bible. But because it's already
[1:47:43] written, you are writing a new Bible.
[1:47:47] And the Bible says we are written
[1:47:51] epistle. Amen. Amen. Well, when it says
[1:47:55] here, I saw a new
[1:47:58] heaven and a new earth. This earth, this
[1:48:03] heaven has no more. Amen. Amen. So
[1:48:08] meaning if we are on the other
[1:48:10] side, we are something and God is
[1:48:16] something because there are moment or
[1:48:19] there were moment where God was not
[1:48:22] God. He became God when he started to
[1:48:27] create. So we need to follow him as our
[1:48:32] father. We will know him
[1:48:35] better day by day. As here the Bible
[1:48:38] says in the old testament he was
[1:48:42] Jehovah.
[1:48:43] Amen looking at the nation of
[1:48:46] Israel. Brother says today he's looking
[1:48:51] at
[1:48:51] us as the bride of
[1:48:54] Jesus. So nothing has changed. is
[1:48:58] still he is still the same
[1:49:02] yesterday. I'm changing
[1:49:04] God. If someone changed is that person
[1:49:08] changing, God has never
[1:49:12] changed. Amen. Amen. That is why this
[1:49:16] cycle was always
[1:49:19] there. So I just wanted to show you the
[1:49:23] tabernacle of God is God himself.
[1:49:26] If it's God himself now that God is with
[1:49:33] me, there are moments where God is with
[1:49:38] me. And where is not with me but being
[1:49:42] something else but because we are his
[1:49:45] children we know him better seem better.
[1:49:51] Amen. Amen. And it
[1:49:54] says I,
[1:49:56] John, saw the holy city, the new
[1:50:00] Jerusalem coming
[1:50:02] down from God out of heaven prepare as a
[1:50:09] bride
[1:50:10] husband. He saw the new
[1:50:14] city. Amen. Amen. in that new city.
[1:50:20] God is with me.
[1:50:24] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:27] Okay. What about the other, you know,
[1:50:30] moments?
[1:50:33] Well, I'm reading brother here
[1:50:37] say God is spoken with Hebrews chapter
[1:50:40] 4. Hebrews chapter 4 paragraph 203 and
[1:50:44] 204. Amen.
[1:50:47] H and if you haven't received it, how do
[1:50:50] you if you haven't received
[1:50:52] it? How do you you can believe miracles?
[1:50:58] That takes
[1:50:59] God in you to
[1:51:02] believe God in
[1:51:05] you, not with
[1:51:08] you. The scripture we read is the
[1:51:11] tabernacle of God or God himself with
[1:51:16] me. But brother I'm saying here
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:21] in a moment where God is in
[1:51:25] you where God is with
[1:51:29] you. You act like God. You know like
[1:51:33] God. You think like God. The Bible says
[1:51:38] you are amateur
[1:51:39] god little gods. Jesus said so for you
[1:51:44] are part of
[1:51:46] God. The only time where God is in
[1:51:51] mean our time during the bride. God is
[1:51:57] in
[1:51:58] me. Brother was always saved. He
[1:52:03] preached the word of God for many years.
[1:52:06] When he preached the word for many
[1:52:08] years, God was always talking to him. He
[1:52:11] was always sending an angel to him. The
[1:52:15] day he said so day I was convinced and I
[1:52:20] was happy. It was when God speak within
[1:52:25] me.
[1:52:26] [Music]
[1:52:28] Amen. Amen. Like Moses, he said, "God,
[1:52:32] you have been talking to me, but I want
[1:52:35] to see you." Brother said, "I was
[1:52:39] talking about
[1:52:40] you. Put many souls to
[1:52:44] Christ. He want to see you." When he
[1:52:47] went to see him, Paul started to talk to
[1:52:51] brother
[1:52:52] Brennan. Then he said that day I become
[1:52:56] a changed person I became something
[1:52:59] else. I started to realize that I am
[1:53:02] heavenly
[1:53:05] bound. Amen. Amen. So
[1:53:08] now for sure now you you know
[1:53:12] me
[1:53:14] practical in life we've got
[1:53:18] pragmatist
[1:53:21] theorist we've got
[1:53:23] imagin but I'm too practical than
[1:53:26] anything
[1:53:27] else I don't want to talk about the
[1:53:30] Bible not making it practical to our
[1:53:33] time we want to see ourselves
[1:53:37] in
[1:53:38] heaven. Amen. Amen. We want to see
[1:53:42] ourselves as who we
[1:53:44] are economy of
[1:53:47] God. Amen. Amen. I want to talk about
[1:53:50] our Lord Jesus
[1:53:53] Christ. You
[1:53:55] know, few
[1:53:58] characters that are too
[1:54:01] practical to put yourself in
[1:54:03] there. Amen. Amen. Meaning brother
[1:54:07] Brennham says if this Bible has been
[1:54:11] written completed and we are here our
[1:54:15] names we don't find brother in the
[1:54:18] Bible like literally written but at the
[1:54:22] back side of the Bible the Bible after
[1:54:24] the seven sins were becomes a new Bible
[1:54:28] now our names are
[1:54:32] there the Bible says Jesus Jesus Christ
[1:54:37] when he died on the cross. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:40] His
[1:54:41] soul went to hell in a
[1:54:45] prison. He preached to the Lord's
[1:54:50] soul. His spirit went back to
[1:54:53] God. His flesh was in the
[1:54:58] grave beyond death. We see those things
[1:55:03] happening. when he preached to the one
[1:55:06] that are in prison, it was not for the
[1:55:12] salvation. Now, brother says that was
[1:55:15] the
[1:55:16] faithful when you preach the message for
[1:55:20] people not to
[1:55:22] repent. Amen. That was our Lord Jesus
[1:55:26] Christ. Now, here comes Paul.
[1:55:29] Paul said I Paul has been 14 years old
[1:55:34] not telling
[1:55:35] you I was
[1:55:38] there in the third
[1:55:40] heaven when he was in the third
[1:55:43] heaven he was there and another part of
[1:55:47] him the natural part of him was here on
[1:55:51] earth but he was on the other side it
[1:55:54] shows you there when you leave there is
[1:55:58] a repres presentation for
[1:56:01] you. That is why as children of God, we
[1:56:05] don't live
[1:56:06] hapazardly. We live with a
[1:56:09] purpose. And he started to teach the
[1:56:12] people of his
[1:56:13] time about what is
[1:56:16] hell, what is heaven, where are you
[1:56:19] going when you depart? And he realized
[1:56:23] Paul
[1:56:25] again if he wishes
[1:56:28] He could have preached to his own
[1:56:31] house and let the people believe the
[1:56:33] word of
[1:56:34] God and go to heaven. But God told him
[1:56:39] there I you know I save those that I
[1:56:42] want to
[1:56:44] save. Then Paul started to realize it's
[1:56:48] not about me. When I preach hard you can
[1:56:52] preach hard it's not going to hell. He
[1:56:56] started to realize that the people saved
[1:57:00] by
[1:57:02] predestination what God has done for
[1:57:05] them who they were
[1:57:08] there save
[1:57:10] you is what saved
[1:57:13] you. Amen. Amen. You are getting saved
[1:57:17] today because you were
[1:57:19] saved. If you were not saved then you
[1:57:22] will never be saved today. We can pray
[1:57:25] for you and do everything and
[1:57:30] fast. If you were not saved, you will
[1:57:33] never be
[1:57:35] saved. So Paul was teaching that.
[1:57:39] Amen. Amen. Now comes brother Brenham
[1:57:41] and brother Brenham said, "I preach like
[1:57:45] Paul." He said it. He said it. If he
[1:57:50] preaches like Paul, Paul was the first
[1:57:53] messenger. He was the prophet. Brother,
[1:57:58] the last messenger, he was the prophet.
[1:58:01] So the first prophet and the last
[1:58:03] prophet, the first messenger and the
[1:58:06] last
[1:58:07] messenger the same
[1:58:12] message. Amen. Amen. Here brother
[1:58:15] Brenham come living an ordinary life
[1:58:18] like every one of us had challenges in
[1:58:22] life had challenges with the text man
[1:58:25] had challenges with his own family had
[1:58:28] challenges with the colleagues had
[1:58:31] challenges in the
[1:58:33] church who are you not having challenges
[1:58:38] you must have challenges in the church
[1:58:40] in your own family with your own
[1:58:42] colleagues
[1:58:43] Anywhere in life, go and read the life
[1:58:48] story of brother
[1:58:50] Bren, we are not exempted from
[1:58:54] it. God gave him an opportunity like he
[1:58:57] did to
[1:58:59] Paul. Amen. Amen. Brother Brham, God
[1:59:02] gave him an opportunity to go to the
[1:59:05] fifth
[1:59:07] dimension and he saw people there and he
[1:59:11] come back and tell us. I saw people
[1:59:14] there. They are crying and going down
[1:59:19] and down and down. And he even say the
[1:59:23] people that I
[1:59:24] saw down there, I saw them here walking.
[1:59:31] You you have a representation
[1:59:33] somewhere either your
[1:59:36] representation is in the fifth dimension
[1:59:39] or the sixth
[1:59:40] dimension. You do not just leave. You
[1:59:44] live with a purpose. You know yourself.
[1:59:48] I'm putting it practical to you. That is
[1:59:51] true. It was said by Paul. It was said
[1:59:55] by Paul. It was said by brother.
[1:59:59] Amen. Amen. If I have to follow, I will
[2:00:02] follow that kind of a
[2:00:06] character character that knows the fifth
[2:00:10] dimension and the sixth dimension. I met
[2:00:14] people Yeah. The people
[2:00:17] say other people they preach about fifth
[2:00:21] dimension, sixth dimension, we don't
[2:00:24] preach there. We are focusing on Christ.
[2:00:29] You are a
[2:00:31] liar. You can't. You can't talk about
[2:00:34] Jesus and leave the devil
[2:00:37] behind. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:40] No. Is Christ is the devil. If you don't
[2:00:44] go to Christ, you will go to the devil.
[2:00:47] If you deny Christ, you accept the
[2:00:50] devil. That's a way of life. We have
[2:00:54] representation from the fifth dimension
[2:00:56] and the sixth dimension.
[2:01:00] Amen. Amen. I was talking to the elders
[2:01:05] yesterday after the funeral
[2:01:07] day. You know when you are a child of
[2:01:11] God, don't just live a careless
[2:01:14] life. Look at where you are, where you
[2:01:18] are going because things are happening.
[2:01:21] Just us as children of
[2:01:23] God, we we know
[2:01:27] better. I said when brother Brenham go
[2:01:32] and read prophet visit South Africa
[2:01:37] when you read that spoken way. Amen.
[2:01:40] Amen. You see brotherham came here went
[2:01:43] to
[2:01:48] pritori preaching the word of God.
[2:01:51] Many people were baptized, were healed,
[2:01:56] the dead were raised. But when you trace
[2:01:58] them back, it's like they're
[2:02:01] untraceable. I even said in Deb, there
[2:02:04] were more Indians. That was 1950
[2:02:08] something. But wait until the spoken
[2:02:11] word fell in the heart of our
[2:02:17] pastor. I have to be practical.
[2:02:21] deny
[2:02:22] that you but I said it.
[2:02:27] Amen. Amen. When the spoken word fell in
[2:02:31] the heart of our
[2:02:33] pastor changed. South Africa has
[2:02:36] changed. Africa has changed. The world
[2:02:40] has changed because God put it in a
[2:02:44] right
[2:02:47] word. You won't believe it because it's
[2:02:50] not in the Bible. But what I'm preaching
[2:02:53] about today is the backside of the
[2:02:57] Bible. Here we are today. You know,
[2:03:01] brother Brennham says,
[2:03:03] "Eaha and Eli when they walk together,
[2:03:08] Elishah
[2:03:09] benefited twice from Elijah." I said to
[2:03:14] you this morning, what God has put in
[2:03:17] our pastor is the
[2:03:19] beneficiary for us. What brother has we
[2:03:24] had it double?
[2:03:28] Yes, it's true. Amen. Amen. Can I tell
[2:03:31] you something? The message that we
[2:03:34] preached in this
[2:03:36] tabernacle is more than what has
[2:03:39] preached.
[2:03:43] Amen. Do you know this church raised the
[2:03:46] dead? Do you know this church heal the
[2:03:49] sick? If you don't know, it's not for me
[2:03:53] to let you
[2:03:54] know. Have your own experience in
[2:03:58] Christ. We write the new Bible. Here we
[2:04:02] are this morning at the backside of the
[2:04:04] Bible.
[2:04:07] Brother himself said, "Lift
[2:04:10] yourself out. Lift
[2:04:13] yourself in
[2:04:16] history. Be a present
[2:04:21] person. It's not us. Is God doing it in
[2:04:27] us today? The tabernacle of God is in
[2:04:32] men, not with men.
[2:04:36] Hallelujah. If you don't know the pastor
[2:04:40] preach the message about the
[2:04:42] underworld maybe it's no longer you
[2:04:44] know. Amen. But he preach about it. I
[2:04:48] want to tell you this. There were men
[2:04:50] and women that said they saw him as
[2:04:54] young men taking them from the
[2:04:59] underworld to
[2:05:01] life. I don't have it in the Bible but
[2:05:04] we are writing a new Bible.
[2:05:06] If you are writing a new Bible,
[2:05:08] something that you cannot read but is
[2:05:12] there a young
[2:05:16] pastor redeeming them. Can you read it
[2:05:19] in the Bible? No, you
[2:05:21] can't say back side of the
[2:05:25] Bible. You believe it or not, a man has
[2:05:29] been made to believe or not.
[2:05:38] So I said if I'm not doing it the right
[2:05:41] way, he will come and flatten it nicely.
[2:05:43] Amen.
[2:05:44] I know people in this church this
[2:05:47] morning that saw our pastor, as young as
[2:05:51] he is, not as this flesh as he is now,
[2:05:55] but a
[2:05:57] young welcoming the people in heaven. I
[2:06:02] don't read it in the Bible
[2:06:05] here saying they saw him ushering them.
[2:06:11] Welcome brothers.
[2:06:13] Welcome for this is your
[2:06:17] home. I want to show you one thing this
[2:06:20] morning. Don't look at a person on this
[2:06:24] flesh
[2:06:26] lost. But we have the
[2:06:29] representation in heaven. That is the
[2:06:32] one that is communicating with us. That
[2:06:36] is the one that is the part of God. This
[2:06:39] one is the part of this flesh, this
[2:06:43] earth. It was born here. It will end
[2:06:46] here. But we have something that was not
[2:06:49] born of a man and a
[2:06:53] woman is the one that welcome us.
[2:06:58] Amen.
[2:07:02] Brothers and sisters, I'm a practical
[2:07:05] man. If if you tell me something, make
[2:07:09] sure you you make me
[2:07:11] understand. But if you know when we at
[2:07:14] school, we've got theorist
[2:07:19] people. Hey, I remember one
[2:07:27] day while they were still teaching us at
[2:07:29] they were teaching me 1 2 3 1 2 3 4
[2:07:33] until
[2:07:36] 19 then I understand then
[2:07:48] 21 I said that means
[2:07:53] 20 and then we enter that is 21. That is
[2:07:56] 20 and one.
[2:07:58] Where are you coming from? That is not
[2:08:00] 21. I said 21. That is
[2:08:02] 201. But to me it was 20 plus.
[2:08:12] Maybe that's why I'm too
[2:08:14] practical because the teacher tried to
[2:08:17] con today I just accept
[2:08:21] because
[2:08:24] 2012 I had a tough
[2:08:27] time x * x is x where am I'm going to
[2:08:32] apply this in
[2:08:34] life square root of
[2:08:37] x that was for
[2:08:40] but I I pass my math and science in
[2:08:44] school. Some you do not understand, you
[2:08:47] just say because they teach you, you
[2:08:50] understand them, you go them with
[2:08:53] life.
[2:08:55] Amen. You need to know the time you are
[2:08:58] living in. The time you are living in is
[2:09:02] the tabernacle of
[2:09:04] God
[2:09:06] in not with
[2:09:08] men, but in the new city.
[2:09:12] is the tabernacle of
[2:09:14] God made. Why? Because in the new city,
[2:09:19] the lamp is the light. We saw him as the
[2:09:23] lamp there. As the light there, we are
[2:09:26] here as the bride is with us. Amen.
[2:09:31] Amen. That is why we see the new
[2:09:35] heaven, the new earth because the first
[2:09:38] one is gone. Amen. On the other side,
[2:09:43] it's him and us. Here, him in us.
[2:09:52] When you walk is him walking. Amen.
[2:09:56] Amen. As I was saying yesterday with the
[2:09:59] brothers, we
[2:10:01] are we can talk the family.
[2:10:04] Always when I look at the pastor, I
[2:10:08] likened him to
[2:10:10] David in the Bible. But I said until I
[2:10:17] read the story of John in Patmos
[2:10:20] vision, my mind
[2:10:22] changed. You know the way I see because
[2:10:26] John Bar was the
[2:10:31] last who lived
[2:10:33] long all of them and as old as he
[2:10:38] was stand behind the pool and teach the
[2:10:42] church where whenever he wish so go and
[2:10:47] read the life of
[2:10:49] John the re the the revelator
[2:10:54] What revelation? Amen. And look at the
[2:10:57] life of your pastor. You will come and
[2:10:59] tell me something.
[2:11:02] I like to follow, observe and you know.
[2:11:06] Yeah. Amen. Go. I challenge you.
[2:11:09] Go and read that. Amen. Amen. You know
[2:11:13] the the word of God is not in our
[2:11:17] mind. It's in our heart.
[2:11:20] Jesus Christ go to Jerusalem looking at
[2:11:25] Jerusalem prophesy about him.
[2:11:29] Automatically the young man the young
[2:11:32] woman put the
[2:11:34] leaves on the ropes for him to
[2:11:40] pass saying the king of glory who
[2:11:43] touched them there. No one else but God
[2:11:48] that was in them.
[2:11:51] them. Do
[2:11:55] it today. God that is in you will tell
[2:12:00] you do it.
[2:12:05] Amen. Amen. Amen. You need to know the
[2:12:07] time we're living
[2:12:11] in. You know Moses, the story of Moses.
[2:12:15] And let's maybe let this the scripture
[2:12:17] because we are in the church. Amen.
[2:12:20] Exodus
[2:12:21] chapter
[2:12:23] um No, no, no. Let's leave that one.
[2:12:27] I'll show you this one.
[2:12:30] Exodus chapter 13.
[2:12:39] Yeah. Verse
[2:12:40] 21. Verse 21.
[2:12:44] And the Lord went before them by day in
[2:12:47] a pillar of cloud to lead them the way
[2:12:51] and by night in a pillar of fire to give
[2:12:54] them light to go by day and night. Amen.
[2:12:58] Amen. Read this one as well. Uh Exodia
[2:13:01] chapter 17. Exodus 17. Verse 11 to 13.
[2:13:07] Verse 11-13.
[2:13:10] And it came to pass when Moses held up
[2:13:13] his hand that Israel prevailed. And when
[2:13:17] he let down his hands, Amalcch
[2:13:19] prevailed. But Moses' hands were heavy.
[2:13:22] And they took a stone and put it under
[2:13:24] him. And he sat there on. And Aaron and
[2:13:28] her stayed up his hands. and one of the
[2:13:33] and one on the one side and the other on
[2:13:36] the other side. And his hands were
[2:13:38] steady until the going down of the sun.
[2:13:41] And Joshua discon
[2:13:45] disconed Amalecch and his people with
[2:13:48] the edge of the sword. Amen.
[2:13:52] Why I read those two two
[2:13:54] scriptures? I want to show you
[2:13:56] that there in
[2:13:59] 13:21 the Bible says God he went before
[2:14:07] them of
[2:14:09] cloud at night a pillar
[2:14:13] of that is the only
[2:14:17] way and only
[2:14:19] way how God communicated with
[2:14:24] God shows that is with
[2:14:28] them. He was above them. The cloud is up
[2:14:33] there. It was God. Amen. Amen. So the
[2:14:37] children of Israel when they see the
[2:14:39] cloud, they start to to have
[2:14:43] joy. He's with us. He's above us. When
[2:14:47] they see that pillar of fire during the
[2:14:50] the the night, the cloud by day is a
[2:14:54] confirmation that God is there for them.
[2:14:58] The very same pillar of fire, the very
[2:15:01] same cloud is the one that
[2:15:04] killed
[2:15:06] Egyptian but
[2:15:08] saved the
[2:15:10] Israelites. The word of God I preached
[2:15:13] this morning is the very same way that
[2:15:17] can save you. That is the very same way
[2:15:20] that can kill someone.
[2:15:26] The word of God, it kills
[2:15:29] and it can also save.
[2:15:32] Amen. Amen. That is the word of God. It
[2:15:35] bring
[2:15:37] separation. The word of God bring
[2:15:41] separation. The gold and the
[2:15:44] sheep they they separate from the same
[2:15:52] crop. It it has started in heaven. It's
[2:15:55] now in earth. The war of the angel in
[2:15:59] the war of the people because in heaven
[2:16:02] we are angels. Here we are flesh but we
[2:16:07] are the same person.
[2:16:11] Amen. Amen. It came to pass
[2:16:15] when Moses held up his hand.
[2:16:19] Israel prevail when he let them down the
[2:16:24] Amalcch prevail. Now what is the plan
[2:16:28] now? Let's make sure Moses hands are
[2:16:32] always up so that we can prevail because
[2:16:35] when they come down they get defeat. we
[2:16:39] get defeated.
[2:16:41] They came up with that plan.
[2:16:44] Amen. Amen. They put the stone and put
[2:16:48] them up. When they up there, Joshua
[2:16:52] defeated the Amalcch.
[2:16:55] [Music]
[2:16:57] Amen. Amen.
[2:16:58] One can say they could have prayed. They
[2:17:02] could have done them and but God said
[2:17:06] just lift up
[2:17:09] Moses. When you lift them up, you shall
[2:17:13] prevail. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:17:16] Same thing even today. As long as
[2:17:20] there's a breath of life in our pastor's
[2:17:23] lungs, we shall lift his hands up. So we
[2:17:28] prevail with Moses with John the
[2:17:31] Revelator and is us today. Same pattern
[2:17:36] because God is unchanging
[2:17:41] God in our time is God in us. That thing
[2:17:48] will happen
[2:17:50] automatically. Amen. Amen. When you
[2:17:52] drive an automatic car, you don't have
[2:17:55] to worry. It just change itself with a
[2:17:58] step heel change itself. You just
[2:18:05] enjoying. Amen. Amen. If it's
[2:18:14] manual, we have problems
[2:18:19] here. I'm not saying you shouldn't buy
[2:18:22] manual cars. But the intake is not the
[2:18:26] same. Start hating me from
[2:18:31] today. He's talking
[2:18:36] about but just the other day.
[2:18:40] I think I'm talking to the mature
[2:18:42] church.
[2:18:51] Amen. Amen. So
[2:18:54] God in that
[2:18:56] time he was revolving around the
[2:18:59] leadership.
[2:19:02] that he put in
[2:19:04] Moses the
[2:19:07] daughter will come. But if they can
[2:19:11] defeat
[2:19:12] Moses, they have defeated
[2:19:15] God. Can
[2:19:18] they never happen? That is why Joshua
[2:19:23] killed the
[2:19:24] Amalachites because he respected the
[2:19:28] leadership of Moses by just lifting his
[2:19:31] hand
[2:19:32] up. When I was reading the life story of
[2:19:36] John of
[2:19:37] Revelation, he
[2:19:41] was
[2:19:43] eyes. They boil him with oil 24 hours
[2:19:48] and then they released him and he went
[2:19:51] to Ephes and he became the sear in the
[2:19:54] church of Ephes. He was old at the age
[2:19:58] of 93 but he could he could speak to the
[2:20:02] church for 10 minutes. When they leave
[2:20:06] they are blessed but other preachers
[2:20:09] come and preach for 4 hours. When
[2:20:13] Congress leave, everybody's angry.
[2:20:20] Yeah. I'm sorry for that.
[2:20:31] 3:1
[2:20:40] 16 verse
[2:20:43] 16. Yes.
[2:20:46] Know ye not that ye are the temple of
[2:20:49] God and that the spirit of God dwelleth
[2:20:52] in you? Amen. It's a question unto you
[2:20:57] that don't you know that you are the
[2:21:01] temple of
[2:21:02] God dwelling place of God. Whatever you
[2:21:05] are doing, whatever you go
[2:21:11] through I I don't know how to express
[2:21:14] this one.
[2:21:18] You know in
[2:21:19] life we have challenges.
[2:21:23] We have anxiety,
[2:21:26] depression, this and that. We cry, we do
[2:21:30] this, we can try there, but it's us as
[2:21:34] people. If we come to a
[2:21:37] realization that the creator
[2:21:41] of is in us, you will relax and let he
[2:21:48] do
[2:21:48] everything in
[2:21:53] you. Talk about it here. He says is God
[2:21:58] working in you God talking in you.
[2:22:04] Hallelujah.
[2:22:06] Amen. Amen. That's what brother is
[2:22:08] saying because we worry a lot about
[2:22:13] these things of the world and they have
[2:22:15] hold us until we cannot see that the
[2:22:19] creator of heaven and earth in us. This
[2:22:23] day we are living in God is in us. God
[2:22:27] is with us will be in the new
[2:22:31] sea. Where will be his bride?
[2:22:34] Amen. Amen. I I gave the example last
[2:22:37] day and say your your nature if your
[2:22:41] nature is the nature of God, you will
[2:22:44] have the nature of God and it will
[2:22:46] remain like
[2:22:49] that. So I was telling them the story
[2:22:52] about the baboon and the
[2:22:55] snake. They had
[2:22:57] agreement that baboon should help the
[2:23:02] snake. You understand? So the snake was
[2:23:05] helping
[2:23:06] baboon to cross the tar road because it
[2:23:10] was too
[2:23:11] hot. Then the baboon said no man. It
[2:23:15] can't be use snake. You like biting
[2:23:19] people in animals. He said those are the
[2:23:23] anti-vilian snakes.
[2:23:31] But the modern snake, there are two
[2:23:35] democrats. I am a
[2:23:37] democrat. I love people. I love baboon.
[2:23:41] I love other animals. And then the
[2:23:43] baboon says,
[2:23:48] hallelujah. Then the baboon carried a
[2:23:51] snake. They crossed the road. They went
[2:23:54] for for for
[2:23:56] hunting then they come back. When they
[2:23:59] come
[2:24:02] back now is the time and the time is
[2:24:05] now. And he bite the baboon. Baboon was
[2:24:12] like what do you think? Snake is his
[2:24:15] name. My nature is to bite and I'm
[2:24:19] biting you. You can do whatever.
[2:24:25] Yes, other people can hide their
[2:24:27] character for far too
[2:24:32] long. They
[2:24:35] fight because our nature never started
[2:24:41] here. I just forgot this this this
[2:24:44] president from Africa somewhere. I I
[2:24:46] just forgot his name. But he's an old
[2:24:48] man. He just love laughing.
[2:24:52] We can laugh and tell the people good
[2:24:55] things when when they want to get those
[2:24:58] things. He will laugh and say, "What do
[2:25:01] you think?" Politic is
[2:25:03] politic. You cannot be an honest
[2:25:05] politician.
[2:25:08] He's a he's an old man. I just I forgot
[2:25:10] his name, but others may know
[2:25:12] him. He tells you the nature of a
[2:25:17] politician.
[2:25:19] Amen. A nature of a baboon and the
[2:25:22] nature of the snake are not the same.
[2:25:26] The snake was made to
[2:25:28] bite
[2:25:30] the Amen. Amen. Then from that time knew
[2:25:34] that I did not trust the
[2:25:37] snakes.
[2:25:38] Amen. Any
[2:25:41] people in life we can go
[2:25:45] together somewhere somehow one will
[2:25:50] say I didn't know you are like
[2:25:55] this yeah the Bible says in Revelation
[2:26:01] 12 when there was a
[2:26:03] war we didn't know that
[2:26:07] Lucifer Lucifer
[2:26:09] I show my color. Let's read from the
[2:26:12] spoken word. Amen.
[2:26:14] Adoption. Amen. Amen. Part four. It
[2:26:18] says, "And now paragraph 76." This may
[2:26:22] just choke you to
[2:26:24] death, but did you know
[2:26:27] that
[2:26:29] men that are sons of
[2:26:31] God are
[2:26:34] amateur? How many ever noted?
[2:26:39] How many knows that Jesus said
[2:26:41] so? Bible Jesus said, "Did not your
[2:26:47] law say itself that you are God?" And if
[2:26:52] you call them God, which God said in
[2:26:55] Genesis chapter 2, that they were
[2:26:58] gods. They they had full
[2:27:01] domain over the dominion of the world.
[2:27:05] He gave him dominion.
[2:27:08] over all
[2:27:09] things. Amen. Amen. God gave a man the
[2:27:15] dominion of all
[2:27:17] things. God wanted a man to be
[2:27:22] God because he wanted to indwell
[2:27:26] himself in a man. The years passed by.
[2:27:31] The Old Testament passed by. The New
[2:27:34] Testament passed by. We see that
[2:27:37] happening today. God in a
[2:27:42] man. Amen. Amen. There was never a time
[2:27:46] like
[2:27:47] ours. During the time of Jesus Christ,
[2:27:50] it was God with
[2:27:53] them. God in Jesus Christ ate with them,
[2:27:58] sail with
[2:28:01] them, do everything with them. Amen.
[2:28:05] Amen. Jesus Christ, he came here to
[2:28:09] taste death so that we may not be fear
[2:28:12] of death.
[2:28:16] He became the wavy
[2:28:19] sea. Amen. That is why today we don't
[2:28:23] fear
[2:28:24] death. No, don't fear death. You fear
[2:28:28] death. It catches you. Why should you
[2:28:31] fear when you die? I always say it's my
[2:28:36] motto of
[2:28:37] life. There is nothing and nothing that
[2:28:41] can happen to me without God not knowing
[2:28:44] about it.
[2:28:53] Maybe some of the things I should ask a
[2:28:56] permission from the pastor to to say
[2:28:59] them because in a mixed
[2:29:03] multitude maybe it's not
[2:29:06] well but go and read the life story of
[2:29:11] brother check what kind of
[2:29:15] challenges he had in
[2:29:18] life and you the challenges of
[2:29:22] life. Tell me the
[2:29:27] difference. Amen. Amen. There's no
[2:29:30] difference and go and check how
[2:29:37] overcame. Brother was scared of text
[2:29:41] man. If you even dream about
[2:29:49] them just to give you one but there are
[2:29:52] too many
[2:29:53] but in the sixth
[2:29:56] dimension you will go through
[2:29:58] those six dimensions dimension. Amen.
[2:30:02] Amen. Let me know. Amen. And he lost his
[2:30:07] god
[2:30:08] sheep. He lost his son sheep.
[2:30:12] He lost his
[2:30:14] domain and Satan took it over and he
[2:30:19] started to control the
[2:30:21] will. Amen. But brother, we are waiting
[2:30:26] for the
[2:30:28] manifestation of the sons of God who
[2:30:31] will come back and take it over again.
[2:30:35] Hallelujah. Amen. Waiting for the
[2:30:38] fullness of
[2:30:39] time. When the pyramid gets
[2:30:43] up to the top, when the four sons of God
[2:30:48] will come
[2:30:49] manifested, when the power of God will
[2:30:52] walk out. Hallelujah. Amen. And we take
[2:30:56] every
[2:30:59] power away from him. Yes, sir. It
[2:31:04] belongs to him.
[2:31:07] Amen. Amen. I want to ask you a
[2:31:09] question.
[2:31:10] Are you still looking for that time
[2:31:12] brother is talking
[2:31:14] about? If you are still looking for that
[2:31:16] time Calvary is still far from it. But I
[2:31:20] want to tell you this morning that time
[2:31:24] is this time. The manifestation
[2:31:28] of is today. We have power over Satan
[2:31:34] because the one who created heaven and
[2:31:36] earth is not with us above us in
[2:31:43] us. He is the one that defeat the devil.
[2:31:48] He was the one who defeated the devil.
[2:31:51] If he defeated the devil and is in me, I
[2:31:55] will defeat the devil.
[2:31:58] And it's not me defeating the devil.
[2:32:01] It's him defeating the devil through me.

[2:33:07] adolescent

[2:33:18] like them. But God said to him, "Don't
[2:33:22] smoke. Don't drink. Don't defile your
[2:33:25] body.
[2:33:27] Then he said yes God. But when God leave

[2:33:41] thing

[2:36:16] problem I'm saying this because many
[2:36:19] people run away and they find a solution
[2:36:24] as the divorce.

[2:36:29] sisters. Some of the things you must not

[2:37:14] Paragraph 43. Paragraph 43. Brother
[2:37:17] Brenham
[2:37:19] safe immediately after that meaning
[2:37:22] after he met the angel
[2:37:25] comes because my 45 minutes is gone. The
[2:37:28] angels of the
[2:37:30] Lord appeared and told me about the
[2:37:34] seven or the seventh
[2:37:37] seal that I was returned back here to
[2:37:41] Jefferson and preach the seventh seal.
[2:37:46] Amen. Amen. When you read the Bible, I
[2:37:51] even found this question in the YouTube
[2:37:53] people
[2:37:55] discussing who brother Brandham think he
[2:37:59] is because the Bible says the lamb that
[2:38:03] was with him was the only one to open
[2:38:07] the seals for. But on a Sunday morning,
[2:38:12] brother stood
[2:38:14] there and said to the church, I am here
[2:38:18] this morning to open the
[2:38:21] seals of
[2:38:25] God. God left heaven, came here on
[2:38:30] earth, incarnate himself in Bren and
[2:38:34] opened the sea. a time we are living in
[2:38:38] the tabernacle of
[2:38:42] God. If you think I'm preaching, I'm not
[2:38:46] preaching. Is God preaching using my
[2:38:50] [Applause]
[2:38:52] body? The glory shall go to
[2:38:55] God. Amen. Amen.
[2:38:58] There were the angels of the
[2:39:00] Lord met us and the Bible becomes a new
[2:39:05] Bible.
[2:39:08] This Bible becomes a new Bible.
[2:39:11] We can close it. When the squeeze comes
[2:39:15] if they take the Bible, don't worry.
[2:39:18] This Bible is in you. You write a new
[2:39:23] Bible. God bless you all. Amen.
[2:39:29] Let's stand to our feet and praise
[2:39:35] God. Amen. Amen.
