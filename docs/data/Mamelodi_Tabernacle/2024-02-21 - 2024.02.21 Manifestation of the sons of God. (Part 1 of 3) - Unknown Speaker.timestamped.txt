[8:03] yes
[8:05] sir and chapter
[8:09] 4 when they assembled
[8:13] together I was with
[8:17] them when the building
[8:23] shook after the prayer
[8:27] meeting the building where they were
[8:31] set I was identified with
[8:37] them amen I preach with Paul on M
[8:45] Hill I was with John on the AIS of
[8:51] petm and I've seen the second
[8:58] coming
[8:59] I was with Luther in the
[9:05] Reformation I was with
[9:10] wesleyy and he
[9:14] continues and here I am
[9:19] tonight
[9:24] 1964 in
[9:25] Philadelphia Philadelphia p
[9:32] identifi with the same
[9:40] group and with the same kind of an
[9:48] experience I must
[9:51] be to be a
[9:54] Christian I must stay
[9:58] identified
[10:02] where the word of God is being
[10:09] manifested Jesus means you are not he is
[10:13] not just identified
[10:18] anywhere at a
[10:22] certain where the way of God is made
[10:28] man
[10:32] am and so was I with brother when he
[10:45] preached we were
[10:50] identified you know why me and the
[10:53] pastor are pastors this
[10:58] morning
[10:59] it is because when brother preach we
[11:07] were we were identified
[11:11] there and now here in the year
[11:16] 2010 with the same group and the same
[11:21] experience are we now being
[11:26] identified am it's still the same thing
[11:30] am the same
[11:32] experience the
[11:35] same the same
[11:47] group so
[11:50] see then I look for what is what does
[11:56] the weight mean manifest
[12:09] um now before I go
[12:12] to this let's check
[12:18] here you know in the book um the spoken
[12:23] is the original
[12:26] seat amen p p
[12:34] 29 the prophet
[12:37] says here is the
[12:40] word yes the word that God
[12:48] spoke the way that God spoke to multiply
[12:51] and replenish
[12:57] the it couldn't find a
[13:01] place oh my
[13:04] God
[13:06] finally this way it caught in the womb
[13:09] of a
[13:13] vision
[13:15] am as we are going to identify
[13:20] ourselves but only where the
[13:27] made am because you have the
[13:32] word and the manifestation of the
[13:38] word now this
[13:41] morning I've got to find the right
[13:47] place you find the right place in the
[13:54] message because there is some places in
[13:57] the message
[14:01] but I must stay identified in the right
[14:07] place amen the right place is where God
[14:13] comes uh for
[14:16] to
[14:23] himself brother says in another book
[14:27] here
[14:30] he says when God takes his
[14:37] position because God also has a
[14:41] position amen amen and we worship him in
[14:46] his
[14:50] position sometimes he is the
[14:53] father sometimes he the
[14:56] son sometimes he's a
[15:00] so him in
[15:06] his John
[15:09] 14 the Lord Jesus
[15:12] said believe in the
[15:17] father believe also in
[15:23] me amen
[15:25] am believe in the father
[15:30] and the father was now in the
[15:34] son believe also in
[15:44] me because before a worshiper can
[15:50] worship he must first find the object of
[15:57] worship
[15:59] you can't worship without
[16:02] F or finding the
[16:12] object okay now let me read when God
[16:16] ever takes his
[16:20] position in the human
[16:23] heart a position in the human
[16:27] heart
[16:30] all the reasonings fade
[16:39] away that
[16:43] means God has to find a
[16:50] position amen amen
[16:54] and I must find a position
[17:01] in the
[17:03] message there is some
[17:07] position and some
[17:12] places now it
[17:15] depends in which
[17:19] position in
[17:21] which or a
[17:24] place do you
[17:27] worship
[17:29] am now brother
[17:32] says I must stay
[17:37] identified where the word of God is
[17:52] made but where the word is
[17:57] made
[18:01] now I ask
[18:03] brother about this
[18:08] manifestation now Christ is the Myer of
[18:11] God
[18:13] revealed now you realize here I
[18:18] say
[18:22] finally the word that God
[18:26] spoke to multiply and replenish the
[18:32] Earth it couldn't find a
[18:37] place now we are going to look at
[18:45] thees God manifest himself in a certain
[18:54] place and there's a scripture again here
[19:00] think in the book of
[19:04] Hebrews you know God's
[19:10] places Hebrews chapter
[19:16] 4
[19:19] verse
[19:23] 4 it
[19:25] say for he spoke in a certain
[19:32] of theeven
[19:36] day a certain
[19:39] place of the seventh
[19:45] day amen that
[19:50] means there was a
[19:55] place not speaking in all the places
[20:07] you know we there's so many message
[20:10] Believers this
[20:14] morning but there is some certain
[20:21] plac brother
[20:25] says God plac AB
[20:32] mes and some
[20:37] other in a certain
[20:42] place say he set them on a
[20:48] b where they could see east west
[20:57] south yes Lord and believe we believe
[21:00] that as children of
[21:04] God we
[21:06] should find the
[21:11] place where we can
[21:22] see so
[21:25] that we we can see all
[21:32] things God said to
[21:35] Abraham I shall not hide from
[21:40] Abraham the things that I
[21:43] do
[21:46] am he set him on a
[21:50] place where he could not bypass
[21:55] him Abraham knew everything
[21:58] that
[22:04] do and shows
[22:07] me that the word of
[22:09] God will be
[22:12] manifested in the
[22:19] bride carried the
[22:23] SE the
[22:25] message to the Bri
[22:32] Gabriel Carri the
[22:41] seed and the
[22:45] seated
[22:52] iny the seed is manifested in the
[22:56] bride
[23:00] amen so the
[23:03] Bride As the
[23:07] FI
[23:08] amen I will read
[23:12] here now it
[23:18] says I'm back to
[23:22] Hebrews
[23:25] chapter for he spoke in a certain
[23:30] Place only those in that certain place
[23:34] he him
[23:43] speak a certain place of the seventh
[23:48] day in this
[23:51] way
[23:53] amen God did
[23:55] rest the seventh day from from all
[24:06] his and in this place
[24:11] again you know it's in
[24:18] a and
[24:21] verse
[24:24] again he limited a certain day
[24:30] saying in
[24:33] David hu
[24:39] together saying in a place in
[24:46] David that means God spoke in
[24:53] David hallu now I will
[24:56] stop the prophet
[25:00] say the word that God
[25:07] spoke couldn't find a
[25:18] place
[25:21] finally this
[25:23] way it C into the wom of a vision
[25:33] that means from the
[25:37] garden the word was traveling
[25:44] coming to it place as
[25:49] a
[25:51] until found a
[25:56] place
[26:01] Mary all
[26:03] right God just spoke
[26:07] it and before it could
[26:13] germinate the
[26:18] serent
[26:20] and he caused a
[26:26] hybrid
[26:28] and that
[26:29] word kept on
[26:35] traveling to
[26:38] place
[26:43] woman because brother tells
[26:47] you that
[26:50] the the the the
[26:54] groom the bridegroom tree
[27:01] without the Bright
[27:07] Tree canot bring
[27:13] FR it must find the
[27:22] female now
[27:25] now I will turn to this
[27:31] now me
[27:36] here what is where is the place of
[27:47] manifestation and he says that is where
[27:50] he is he stays
[27:56] identified
[28:00] not where there's
[28:05] questions when they were
[28:08] waiting when they were
[28:11] waiting in the upper
[28:14] room they were not asking
[28:18] questions God said to
[28:21] them
[28:25] wait so waiting
[28:29] never ask any
[28:32] questions
[28:34] and
[28:37] suddenly there was a
[28:42] sound where they were
[28:46] waiting
[28:49] now a promised
[28:54] child
[28:56] wait wait for the promise promise to
[29:02] him Amen in the right
[29:08] place now brother
[29:11] says let's look at
[29:14] the
[29:19] manifestation God and the man was
[29:26] one
[29:28] he says this this is God's great
[29:32] mystery that is Page
[29:37] 64 God and man was
[29:43] one
[29:47] there and God and man is
[29:55] one amen amen
[29:58] so because God don't change his
[30:05] pattern if he was one
[30:09] there then at the end time God and man
[30:13] is
[30:17] one because is the
[30:25] restoration God and
[30:29] isn't it
[30:33] wonderful they were
[30:38] one I will say to you brother and God
[30:42] were
[30:51] one you and God
[30:56] are
[31:00] am
[31:02] God deals first with one
[31:18] man bring
[31:24] fors so he deals first with
[31:30] one
[31:36] with if you can say to
[31:40] me brother
[31:46] is I
[31:52] will
[31:54] amen first brother
[31:58] he deal with
[32:05] one says is now
[32:16] in the same God
[32:21] was is now in
[32:26] you
[32:29] he deals first with one
[32:34] man he was in one
[32:39] Jesus then he was in the
[32:50] apostles he was in one
[32:54] Elijah then he was in Elijah
[33:05] one
[33:08] brother
[33:13] many amen amen
[33:17] and now it
[33:20] says God and Men I love
[33:25] this because God is a man we read the
[33:28] other
[33:32] day and what it
[33:36] is being filled with the spirit him
[33:40] having his
[33:47] prein that was God's
[33:53] achievement that's
[33:55] purpose
[33:59] he might be in
[34:01] Christ and Christ in
[34:06] US it doesn't remain with him only in
[34:12] Christ but it is now Christ in
[34:18] us as he
[34:20] said at that
[34:22] day you shall know that I am in
[34:25] you
[34:31] okay God was coming
[34:35] down to his
[34:41] place he just don't
[34:45] change God
[34:49] in that is his
[34:55] manifestation so the
[34:59] world the whole
[35:02] creation was waiting for
[35:08] that what was W
[35:11] for for God to come to his
[35:18] place the Book of
[35:21] Revelation it
[35:23] says God is with his people
[35:37] that's
[35:40] why this
[35:44] morning there is this confusion among
[35:47] the
[35:52] people
[35:54] some believe that the Lord has come
[36:01] some believe that he is
[36:07] coming
[36:12] coming amen
[36:17] am there
[36:19] was this man brother bam speaks
[36:22] about uh
[36:25] Albert Einstein
[36:45] Albert Einstein Al
[36:49] Einstein
[36:52] he he was asked the
[36:55] question
[36:58] by some other
[37:04] scientist because Einstein
[37:08] had uh some
[37:14] telescope and his telescope was
[37:22] Advanced compared with the other
[37:25] telescopes
[37:30] now they all probed the
[37:40] universe ining the
[37:45] universe each and every one would come
[37:49] with a
[37:54] conclusion each and every one of the
[38:01] would come with a
[38:08] conclusion but you know with the
[38:14] universe the more they discover
[38:19] something the more they see some
[38:25] other
[38:28] so it is just not
[38:34] ending so that's why
[38:39] Einstein made a
[38:42] better
[38:47] telescope he invested
[38:49] one he invested a better
[38:55] telescope now they came to him and asked
[39:02] him they said what is the
[39:08] answer
[39:10] because they discover some other
[39:15] stars only to discover that there is
[39:19] some other
[39:24] stars so there was no
[39:29] conclusion now the answer of
[39:34] alstein he said to
[39:37] them we shall never
[39:55] never
[40:01] h
