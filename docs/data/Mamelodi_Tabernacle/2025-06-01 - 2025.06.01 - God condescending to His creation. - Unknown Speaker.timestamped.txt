[0:00] and
[0:02] pray. Gracious
[0:05] Lord, indeed thou art precious
[0:09] Lord. You are the our only hope, Lord
[0:15] Almighty. We are together
[0:20] again. Father, with our heads
[0:23] bowed this morning, we present our souls
[0:26] unto thee.
[0:29] You being the one that has processed us,
[0:32] Lord, from your
[0:36] mind, having that knowledge and
[0:38] understanding,
[0:40] Lord, through the power and the spirit
[0:43] that you gave
[0:45] us. We are worshiping thee, Lord, from
[0:48] the depth of our
[0:51] hearts. And we know the reason why we
[0:54] are here
[0:56] Lord. The reason for our gathering here
[0:59] Lord Almighty is to bring glory unto
[1:02] thee and to hear thee answering us Lord
[1:07] Almighty as per promise father that you
[1:11] will never leave us alone.
[1:13] It's a promise that comes from being
[1:15] gracious Lord that you will always be
[1:18] with us. And at this moment,
[1:22] Father, we bring that glory unto
[1:25] thee. And with the bubbling of our
[1:28] hearts, we call upon your presence,
[1:31] Lord. Calling upon the powerful name of
[1:34] our Lord Jesus Christ, as per promise,
[1:38] that father, when that name is
[1:42] mentioned, everything's in heaven
[1:44] itself, Lord, even here on earth, Lord
[1:48] Almighty, even all the dark forces,
[1:51] Father, when they hear that name, they
[1:54] bow down, Father.
[1:56] We are here gracious heavenly father
[1:59] giving thanks unto thee Lord for being
[2:02] with us all these times. We came all the
[2:06] way Lord from our different places from
[2:09] different directions
[2:11] to come Lord Almighty and serve you Lord
[2:14] right from the depths of our heart as
[2:18] you are looking at us right at this
[2:20] moment you know each and everyone's
[2:23] heart gracious Lord and you know each
[2:26] and everyone's need Lord Almighty may
[2:29] you Lord Almighty impound yourself Lord
[2:33] and come Lord Almighty and give us
[2:35] accordingly. Gracious Lord, Father, we
[2:38] always say have mercy upon us. Forgive
[2:42] us Lord Almighty for the wrong steps
[2:45] that we have taken. We always like to
[2:48] please you Lord and do the right thing
[2:50] father. May you look at our hearts Lord
[2:53] and look at our imagination Lord and our
[2:57] reasoning gracious heavenly father.
[2:59] There should be that positive Lord to
[3:02] make you happy father. We are so
[3:04] thankful to serve a God that really
[3:08] cares for us, Father. Thank you, Father.
[3:12] As we are about to receive your word,
[3:15] gracious Lord, we bow our heads and say
[3:19] hallelujah unto thee, Lord. Thank you,
[3:22] Father, for taking us up those far Lord.
[3:26] And thank you gracious heavenly father
[3:28] for shedding that power. The word that
[3:31] has got power and the living word lord
[3:34] almighty. Here are your children
[3:36] gathered here. Gloria heavenly father.
[3:39] We like to say there's a pullpit here
[3:42] Lord Almighty which is your altar and
[3:45] that's where you descend. We we we pray
[3:48] Lord Almighty that you bind our hearts
[3:51] Lord and bind everything Lord Almighty
[3:54] and put it upon that altar gracious
[3:57] heavenly father and if there's any vile
[4:01] anybody that has got a vial in his or
[4:04] her heart Lord comfort her Lord Almighty
[4:07] with the word that will be coming this
[4:09] morning Lord Almighty may he hear it
[4:12] directly from your throne Lord Almighty
[4:15] it should be from your throne in heaven
[4:18] to your throne in our hearts. Father,
[4:21] thank you, Father. As we are worshiping
[4:23] thee, as we are anticipating, gracious
[4:26] Lord, to hear from thee, may you, Lord
[4:29] Almighty, come and and be with us. Not
[4:33] forgetting that we we have power to say
[4:36] to the evil one, he is rather too late
[4:41] because the sins have been revealed unto
[4:45] ours. There's no way in which we can
[4:48] turn back. Neither is there a way for
[4:51] him to enter in. Everything has been
[4:54] closed in. Lord Almighty, everything is
[4:57] at the back of the book. Gracious Lord,
[5:00] thank you father for giving us these
[5:02] understandings and these knowledges.
[5:04] Lord Almighty, we commit everybody in
[5:07] here unto your hand. Father, let not
[5:11] even a single one, Lord, have a bad
[5:14] thought because that will be a base for
[5:17] the evil spirit. So we close it up. This
[5:21] evil spirit, it has got no power over
[5:24] your children. Lord Almighty, thank you,
[5:27] Father. Everybody that will be coming
[5:30] here rendering an item, Father, let it
[5:33] be an item that will shine deep down in
[5:36] his or her heart, Lord, and even be
[5:39] reflected to your the believers, Lord,
[5:42] and the speaker that will be standing
[5:44] behind the pullpit, Lord. Let it come
[5:47] deep down, Lord Almighty, from eternity
[5:50] to the eternity in your in our souls,
[5:53] Lord. Thank you, Father. And we know
[5:56] that you will answer us. We will never
[5:59] ask a bread then you gave us a brick
[6:02] Lord Almighty. Whenever we ask for a
[6:05] fish Lord Almighty, you will never give
[6:07] us a snake. Thank you father for we pray
[6:10] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[6:13] Amen and amen.
[7:09] Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus
[7:12] Christ.
[7:15] Amen. Like to thank God for the
[7:19] privilege of coming into his house.
[7:22] Amen.
[7:25] When I saw my name last week that I'll
[7:30] be
[7:32] singing, it's always a task for
[7:35] me that
[7:38] I I go and search and go deep and try to
[7:42] find
[7:45] something. It is motivated by the fact
[7:48] that we have to bring something
[7:51] something that is always
[7:54] relevant and something that will
[7:58] edify. So I I personally don't take it
[8:01] lightly. I sometimes I search in my
[8:05] spirit and find that there's
[8:08] nothing
[8:10] but
[8:12] around
[8:13] Thursday somewhere
[8:15] there I was meditating on this scripture
[8:18] in
[8:19] numbers chapter
[8:22] 16 we all know the scripture
[8:26] where deathan and
[8:29] gora and all those that were with him
[8:33] with
[8:35] them trying to
[8:38] challenge the
[8:41] priesthood. But what struck me was
[8:44] that they they said something about
[8:48] Moses being
[8:51] holy. So when listening
[8:53] to he always likes
[8:56] to define things, put things into
[8:59] perspective so that you have an
[9:00] understanding. So I
[9:02] questioned, what is this
[9:05] holiness that this Bible is referring
[9:07] to? Is it
[9:08] just living a clean life
[9:12] or does it go deeper?
[9:18] Then quickly I was turning the pages of
[9:20] the Bible. I went to
[9:23] Ephesians chapter one where it says God
[9:26] has chosen us in him.
[9:31] before the foundation of the world that
[9:34] we should be holy. Hallelujah.
[9:38] So I said, what is this holiness?
[9:42] And the only answer that I could find
[9:44] was that that whom God has chosen,
[9:48] he declares him to be holy.
[9:52] Whether people like it or they don't
[9:55] like it, he has declared
[9:58] them to be
[10:01] holy. So was happy to say it has got
[10:05] nothing. Moses had a pending case in
[10:07] Egypt. He
[10:09] ran. But when when God and when he met
[10:12] God out of the burning
[10:14] bush, from that point on, God declares
[10:18] him, you are holy.
[10:21] So I got the answer from there to say
[10:23] holiness. Yes, we live right. We we try
[10:26] as Baba has said in his prayer that we
[10:29] try and do our best. But this holiness
[10:32] is something
[10:34] that God has to bring down to us
[10:38] so that we should live a holy life.
[10:42] And I said, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you.
[10:45] because I don't have to strive on my
[10:47] own. But you give
[10:49] me you give me something. Hallelujah.
[10:56] He gives us
[10:58] something. We look at ourselves. We look
[11:00] at our mistakes and say, "But Lord, am I
[11:03] worthy?" And he says, "Yes,
[11:06] you are holy because I have chosen."
[11:12] So coming to to the
[11:15] service, a song
[11:17] came and it says,
[11:31] Give me
[11:34] [Music]
[11:38] give
[11:39] me give
[11:42] [Music]
[11:51] Angel give
[11:54] [Music]
[12:06] me Hallelujah.
[12:10] [Music]
[12:19] Oh, give
[12:21] me no
[12:26] tand. Give
[12:30] [Music]
[12:33] me give me.

[13:07] Great is your
[13:11] mercy towards me.

[13:16] [Music]
[13:17] kindness towards me.

[38:53] You know, a church which doesn't have a
[38:56] pastor, it doesn't go
[38:59] right. But when you've got a pastor,
[39:03] everything.
[39:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[39:08] Hallelujah. Today we've got our deacon,
[39:15] brother. Brother for the word of God.
[39:20] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[39:22] So as we are
[39:24] singing our special song, can we all
[39:28] stand up so that we can
[39:31] welcome the men of
[39:33] God for the word of
[39:39] [Music]
[39:47] God where
[39:53] shall
[39:55] be
[39:58] to
[40:01] let
[40:04] him of
[40:06] God should be
[40:09] finished as
[40:11] he has
[40:14] declared to
[40:17] be the prophet.
[40:19] [Music]
[40:22] Behold, I sent
[40:25] you
[40:28] Elijah and
[40:30] prophet
[40:33] [Music]
[40:39] before
[40:41] day and
[40:43] he shall
[40:46] tell the
[40:49] Hearts of the
[40:51] fathers to the
[40:54] children and the
[40:57] hearts of the
[41:00] children to their fathers.
[41:05] Yes, I
[41:08] come.
[41:10] Yes,
[41:14] I
[41:16] [Music]
[41:18] might
[41:22] [Music]
[41:30] with Holy Ghost.
[41:35] Holy
[41:37] Ghost receptwhere.
[41:42] [Music]
[41:49] [Music]
[42:01] [Music]
[42:08] [Applause]
[42:15] God bless you
[42:18] as I greet you all in the precious name
[42:20] of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[42:26] Christ. Amen.
[42:30] Today I have been requested to stand in
[42:32] the gap
[42:39] and I believe you have
[42:43] prayed and I also believe that the Lord
[42:46] will bless
[42:50] us and the pastor also says
[42:57] he will see us very soon.
[43:03] So we come to the pulpit
[43:07] with his blessings.
[43:11] As my elder last week
[43:16] indicated, we are only standing in the
[43:20] gap because the pullpit belongs to the
[43:27] pastor and we were looking at the
[43:30] scripture together with my
[43:33] brother and we
[43:38] confessed for these scriptures. us.
[43:42] The only person that can interpret them
[43:46] is our pastor.
[43:51] So may the Lord richly bless him.
[43:56] And I must also
[43:59] confess that the little thought that I
[44:04] have, I got
[44:08] inspired from a message that the pastor
[44:10] preached.
[44:13] There was a message that the pastor
[44:16] preached titled the condescended
[44:24] god. So this little
[44:28] thought we received it from that message
[44:32] that the
[44:35] pastor. So let us open our scriptures.
[44:39] Now I want us to open Revelation 3 verse
[44:49] 20 and also Ephesians
[44:57] 1:4. Let me ask our
[45:01] elder just to say a word of prayer.
[45:07] May the Lord richly bless you.
[45:12] Amen. Let's bow our heads in
[45:17] prayer. Gracious
[45:21] Lord, we have prayed. We have
[45:25] heard the testimonies. We have
[45:29] heard the hymns and songs.
[45:33] Amen. And now is a time Lord Almighty
[45:38] that we should know that those were just
[45:41] the introduction.
[45:43] They were just laying a foundation for
[45:45] your word.
[45:47] Now that your
[45:48] word is about to be announced here. Yes
[45:53] Lord. We have our brother here brother
[45:55] Mete
[45:57] of which we all know him as our
[46:00] deacon. Amen. And father we commit him
[46:03] unto thee that he is a man. He cannot
[46:07] preach to us. But you are the only one
[46:10] that can preach to us. But gracious
[46:13] heavenly father, you use a man and you
[46:17] use a voice of a man.
[46:19] Father, we surrender Lord Almighty to
[46:22] the one that you have elected today.
[46:25] Amen. To speak to us Lord Almighty. not
[46:29] really to him but to the voice that will
[46:31] be coming after that Lord. We pray that
[46:34] you anoint our brother Lord. Amen. And
[46:37] inspire him Lord. Amen. And give him
[46:40] faith Lord on what you have given him
[46:42] Lord. And open up our hearts gracious
[46:46] heavenly father that what what comes
[46:49] from his mouth should be what come from
[46:52] your heart father so that it should
[46:55] benefit us all. Gracious Lord, thank you
[46:58] father for we pray in the precious name
[47:00] of our Lord Jesus Christ as we are about
[47:03] to read the word Lord those scriptures
[47:06] that we're about to read. Amen. Expand
[47:09] them Lord Almighty. Amen. Let them bring
[47:12] faith in our hearts let them bring an
[47:15] understanding in our hearts so that at
[47:18] the end of this sermon father we should
[47:21] say thank you father you really loved us
[47:23] Lord. Amen. that we pray in the precious
[47:26] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[47:29] amen. Amen.
[47:32] Let us start with Ephesians chapter 1
[47:41] verse4. According as he hath chosen us
[47:44] in him before the foundation of the
[47:46] world, that we should be holy and
[47:49] without blame before him in love.
[47:53] And let us also
[47:55] read the second epistle of
[47:59] Peter chapter 1 verse 1-4.
[48:06] Second Peter chapter 1 from verse
[48:12] 1-4. Simon Peter, a servant and apostle
[48:16] of Jesus Christ to them that have
[48:18] obtained like precious faith with with
[48:22] us through the righteousness of God and
[48:25] our savior Jesus Christ. Grace and peace
[48:28] be multiplied unto you through the
[48:31] knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ our
[48:34] Lord. according as his divine power hath
[48:37] given unto us all things that pertain
[48:40] unto life and good
[48:42] godliness, through the knowledge of him
[48:45] that hath called us to glory and virtue,
[48:49] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[48:53] great and precious promises, that by
[48:55] this ye might be partakers of the divine
[48:59] nature, having escaped the corruption
[49:02] that is in the world through lust.
[49:05] And Revelation 3 20. Revelation
[49:11] 3:20. Behold, I stand at the door and
[49:15] knock. If any man hear my voice and open
[49:18] the door, I will come in to him and will
[49:22] s with him and he with me. Amen. You may
[49:26] be seated.
[49:30] [Music]
[49:36] We want to title this
[49:42] message God condescending to his
[49:50] creation. And our text
[49:57] Enor.
[50:02] Yes. Amen.
[50:06] Means
[50:08] uh God changing his mask.
[50:16] So I was looking at the word
[50:19] condescending.
[50:24] So it says the
[50:27] conesion of God
[50:31] refers to God's act of
[50:35] voluntarily lowering
[50:43] himself to engage with
[50:50] humanity. often out of love or
[50:53] compassion.
[50:59] And we are aware of a scripture in the
[51:02] book of
[51:06] Thessalonians that
[51:08] says, "The Lord himself shall
[51:14] descend with a shout."
[51:18] Now descent
[51:19] [Music]
[51:21] also has similarities to
[51:28] condescending because
[51:31] descending means moving
[51:34] down or going from a higher
[51:39] place to a lower
[51:43] position. So that's why our title says
[51:49] God condescending
[51:54] to his creation.
[51:58] So I took it from the spoken word
[52:01] stature of a perfect man.
[52:04] Stature of a perfect man.
[52:07] Paragraph 65 says paragraph 65. What is
[52:12] it?
[52:15] God condescending to his
[52:20] creation. God wants to be
[52:24] woripped. The word God means object of
[52:31] worship. And is God trying to condition
[52:34] his
[52:38] people so he can get from them what he
[52:41] created them for?
[52:47] He never made you
[52:51] to be something
[52:53] else beside a son and daughter of
[53:00] God. If you have missed
[53:03] that of being a son and daughter of
[53:08] God, you have missed the mark.
[53:15] And paragraph 63 also says paragraph 63
[53:20] remember God reveals
[53:24] himself in three ways.
[53:28] First
[53:30] time he revealed himself in a pillar of
[53:35] fire and that was called the fatherhood.
[53:42] Then that same God
[53:45] made manifested in Jesus
[53:49] Christ. So at first he revealed
[53:54] himself through the
[53:58] fatherhood. It was God above us.
[54:04] Then secondly,
[54:06] he manifested himself
[54:09] in Christ Jesus.
[54:12] He built a
[54:17] body came to the
[54:20] earth and through the death of that
[54:25] body he sanctified the church
[54:31] so that he can dwell in the church.
[54:43] Firstly, it was the
[54:46] fatherhood, God above
[54:50] us.
[54:52] Secondly, it was God with
[54:55] us. He came and
[54:58] manifested as the Lord Jesus
[55:03] Christ. And the Bible called him
[55:06] Emmanuel, God with us.
[55:12] But fatly
[55:15] it was God
[55:17] in us.
[55:20] So he
[55:24] condescended from the
[55:28] fatherhood. He was coming
[55:31] down. Then it was God with us.
[55:36] We had fellowship with
[55:38] him and he was
[55:42] crucified so that he can come back
[55:47] again to be God in
[55:51] us. So he was changing
[55:56] forms as he was
[55:59] coming. Uh let me read a quotation here.
[56:05] H which also blessed me
[56:11] where the prophet says
[56:15] in the book Christ is the mystery of God
[56:21] revealed paragraph 476 amen it says he
[56:26] just don't
[56:29] change is God in Amen.
[56:33] [Music]
[56:34] Let me start
[56:35] here. Says the whole thing
[56:39] is God. Amen.
[56:43] The pastor read this many times for
[56:46] us. Say this is God's great mystery of
[56:50] love
[56:53] express that God and man became one.
[57:00] So is God in
[57:03] man. Amen.
[57:06] And that's the final destination.
[57:12] That's his
[57:17] manifestation. And he says,
[57:21] I want you not to fail to get this.
[57:26] God accept nothing
[57:30] else but Christ in you.
[57:36] The hope of glory.
[57:39] The only thing that God
[57:43] recognizes is Christ in
[57:46] you, the hope of
[57:49] glory. So when God is
[57:54] condescending to his
[57:57] creation, the final
[58:00] destination is God in a man.
[58:06] Amen.
[58:08] Amen. Let us look at it
[58:17] here. I want to read
[58:20] uh who is this
[58:22] Melkisedc? Who is this Melkisedc?
[58:28] You know when you are sitting at the
[58:29] corner and looking at
[58:35] this you find them very
[58:39] easy. The problem is when you come to
[58:41] the
[58:48] Hallelujah. Amen.
[58:51] Amen. Now we find out that this
[58:57] person no beginning of days or ending of
[59:02] days or ending of
[59:05] life. It was
[59:08] God end.
[59:12] Now the word
[59:15] enmop comes from the Greek
[59:18] word and it means changing himself.
[59:24] That means
[59:27] God changing his
[59:32] mask. And when God change his
[59:36] mask, he expect
[59:39] us to recognize him.
[59:43] Hallelujah.
[59:45] If you fail to recognize him,
[59:49] the prophet
[59:50] says you miss the
[59:54] mark. So when you recognize
[59:57] him, when he change his
[1:00:00] mark, God is
[1:00:03] pleased when when you recognize
[1:00:07] him. So he will always change his mouth.
[1:00:12] and come to us. You know there's a
[1:00:15] scripture in the book of Job.
[1:00:19] It says
[1:00:20] God visit
[1:00:22] us every morning.
[1:00:27] [Applause]
[1:00:29] So the question you must ask
[1:00:33] yourself, what did
[1:00:36] God say to me this
[1:00:39] morning? So every day when you wake
[1:00:43] up
[1:00:45] remember God visit
[1:00:48] us. So we have to recognize
[1:00:52] him and when you recognize
[1:00:55] him, God is well pleased.
[1:01:01] Amen.
[1:01:03] And it says when you recognize him
[1:01:08] you must say the right
[1:01:11] thing and and when you say the right
[1:01:15] thing it will please the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:21] So he comes to us
[1:01:27] every
[1:01:31] morning. So it says the same God
[1:01:36] was made
[1:01:37] flesh and dwelt among
[1:01:40] us. You see God changed his
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:47] form and came to us.
[1:01:51] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:54] So that he could be seen.
[1:02:03] And
[1:02:05] God
[1:02:07] masked in the pillar of
[1:02:10] fire and that was the fatherhood.
[1:02:15] God
[1:02:18] must as a man called
[1:02:23] Jesus.
[1:02:29] Amen. So it was God above
[1:02:33] us, God with us.
[1:02:37] Now he conddes descended
[1:02:44] and now is God in
[1:02:48] us. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:57] He came to
[1:02:58] Abraham
[1:03:01] Abraham and Abraham
[1:03:05] recognized. He came to Abraham as a
[1:03:09] man. I love the way our pastor
[1:03:12] dramatized it.
[1:03:15] Or it was three men,
[1:03:22] dusty shoes,
[1:03:26] they walked
[1:03:28] and they ate and they were
[1:03:33] hungry. But when Abraham saw them,
[1:03:38] [Music]
[1:03:39] surely they passed other people on the
[1:03:41] road.
[1:03:46] I'm sure one of them was
[1:03:48] saying maybe one of them was saying hey
[1:03:51] this man
[1:03:52] really but when Abraham saw
[1:03:56] them he recognized him
[1:04:02] and he said my
[1:04:04] Lord not my
[1:04:06] Lord but he recognized him.
[1:04:14] And he was so pleased
[1:04:17] that Abraham recognized
[1:04:21] him and they had a fellowship.
[1:04:25] The other
[1:04:27] two they
[1:04:30] left they went to
[1:04:32] Sodom but he stayed with Abraham.
[1:04:40] the other day came to Abraham
[1:04:46] ascal
[1:04:48] others saw a
[1:04:50] man I'm sure some may have said
[1:04:55] this man is
[1:04:58] rich sawing him in camels you
[1:05:02] know but Abraham
[1:05:05] recognized him.
[1:05:10] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:05:13] So when he change his form,
[1:05:19] we as the
[1:05:22] attributes must recognize him.
[1:05:28] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:31] Let's move forward.
[1:05:35] Unless we have a diagram here.
[1:05:40] I want us to look at it.
[1:05:43] If the brothers can display the
[1:05:45] diagram of the church ages. Amen.
[1:05:51] So he changed himself from a pillar of
[1:05:56] fire to become a man. Amen. Amen. Then
[1:06:01] he changed himself back in the spirit
[1:06:03] again
[1:06:06] that he might dwell in men.
[1:06:11] So when it was God with
[1:06:13] us, he referred to
[1:06:17] himself as the son of man.
[1:06:24] the son of man because he was a prophet.
[1:06:31] Now the prophet says,
[1:06:35] Jesus never referred to
[1:06:38] himself as son of
[1:06:41] God. He referred to himself as son of
[1:06:46] man because the scripture cannot be
[1:06:49] broken.
[1:06:53] when he was here on the
[1:06:56] earth as the son of man.
[1:07:00] The prophet says it was
[1:07:03] God
[1:07:06] acting in a
[1:07:10] man. It was God acting in a
[1:07:14] man. He just changed from the pillar of
[1:07:19] fire and then had to come in
[1:07:24] a body of a man.
[1:07:29] Hallelujah. Amen. So he never referred
[1:07:32] to himself as the son of God,
[1:07:35] but he referred to
[1:07:37] himself as son of man.
[1:07:41] [Music]
[1:07:42] Now they had to recognize him.
[1:07:46] as the son of man.
[1:07:50] Now the prophet says, "Look at that
[1:07:54] sophinician
[1:07:57] woman who ran to
[1:07:59] him and said, thou son of
[1:08:03] David, have mercy on me."
[1:08:07] He never as much raised his
[1:08:13] head because this
[1:08:15] woman was a
[1:08:17] gentile and he had no claims on
[1:08:23] him as son of
[1:08:26] David. So when this woman
[1:08:29] said son of David
[1:08:32] have mercy on me that means this woman
[1:08:37] did not recognize him.
[1:08:41] So the prophet said the Lord Jesus did
[1:08:45] not did not even raise his
[1:08:48] hand because he was not recognized.
[1:08:54] So he was not
[1:08:57] pleased that this gentile recognize
[1:09:02] him. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:09:07] But look
[1:09:11] at blind Batimus.
[1:09:16] He was a Jew.
[1:09:21] So the gentile woman
[1:09:24] had no claims on him as son of David.
[1:09:31] But blind
[1:09:34] Batimas had a claim on
[1:09:37] him as son of David.
[1:09:42] But the gentile woman had to recognize
[1:09:46] him as son of
[1:09:52] man. Now the prophet talks about sister.
[1:09:59] You have to know these
[1:10:01] words and these
[1:10:04] things. That's what the prophet
[1:10:06] says. You have to know these words.
[1:10:12] Look at her
[1:10:14] right that time when the third pool you
[1:10:20] remember of
[1:10:23] all of
[1:10:26] everything that woman said the right
[1:10:30] thing. So this woman recognized
[1:10:36] him when the third pool was revealed.
[1:10:42] You've got to say the right
[1:10:45] word, the right thing to
[1:10:49] God. So,
[1:10:52] sister said the right
[1:10:54] thing because he recognized
[1:10:58] him as the son of
[1:11:01] man. Amen. Amen. While we are still on
[1:11:05] our diagram,
[1:11:08] I also want to read few things here
[1:11:15] uh from the unveiling of God. The
[1:11:18] unveiling of
[1:11:24] God. There was this little woman
[1:11:29] also in all of her
[1:11:32] sin. The Samaritan woman,
[1:11:36] she recognized him.
[1:11:41] We know the Messiah is coming
[1:11:45] which is called the Christ.
[1:11:49] She
[1:11:50] recognized because she was a
[1:11:53] predestinated s.
[1:11:59] That's why it's very
[1:12:01] important to know who he
[1:12:06] is in your time.
[1:12:14] Now let's let's look at some of the
[1:12:17] Greek.
[1:12:21] The Greeks wanted to see
[1:12:24] him. And when Jesus was
[1:12:27] veiled, it was to do the work of
[1:12:32] redemption at the
[1:12:35] cross. So God could not die as a spirit.
[1:12:41] He had to put on a
[1:12:45] mask and come as a
[1:12:48] man and and die at the
[1:12:52] cross. Now the Greeks wanted to see
[1:12:57] him but they could not see him.
[1:13:01] They have seen the
[1:13:03] form of a
[1:13:05] man,
[1:13:07] but they did not recognize him.
[1:13:16] Here they could not see him.
[1:13:22] The Greeks wanted to see God.
[1:13:27] And there he
[1:13:29] was veiled in a
[1:13:34] man and they could not see him. But they
[1:13:38] saw the
[1:13:42] man. They could not understand
[1:13:46] how why that they could not recognize
[1:13:51] him. There stood a
[1:13:53] man. They come to see God.
[1:13:57] and they see a man.
[1:14:03] Keep in your
[1:14:05] mind, God was veiled in a
[1:14:13] manual. So they come to see
[1:14:17] God and they were convinced
[1:14:21] and they have heard about
[1:14:24] Jesus. So they come to see
[1:14:28] God but they were
[1:14:30] disappointed. They saw a
[1:14:35] man. The prophet says paragraph 101
[1:14:39] unveiling of
[1:14:41] God. Now be real
[1:14:44] careful. He is the
[1:14:47] same
[1:14:50] yesterday and forever.
[1:14:58] God gave us a shepherd.
[1:15:01] God gave us a pastor.
[1:15:06] The word of God
[1:15:08] comes to
[1:15:10] the exact because the prophet says they
[1:15:15] will see us
[1:15:19] through. Now God predestinated our
[1:15:22] pastor
[1:15:25] to be our
[1:15:27] shepherd. Amen. And God hides and veil
[1:15:31] himself in a
[1:15:35] man now because it's the same yesterday,
[1:15:41] today. The question is when you look,
[1:15:46] what do you see?
[1:15:51] Amen. Amen. God veiled in the form of a
[1:15:56] man, hid himself from their
[1:16:01] view. They could only see a
[1:16:06] man, but those
[1:16:10] predestinated saw
[1:16:14] God. One saw a
[1:16:16] man, the other one saw God.
[1:16:21] And the prophet says
[1:16:24] both they were
[1:16:27] right. One saw a
[1:16:31] man so
[1:16:35] God. So the prophet
[1:16:37] says those that are
[1:16:41] predestinated when they looked at that
[1:16:44] man they saw God.
[1:16:47] [Applause]
[1:16:48] But those that are not
[1:16:52] predestined when they look at the
[1:16:56] man can
[1:16:58] really preach.
[1:17:00] I can really put it nicely. You preach
[1:17:03] nice.
[1:17:06] But they don't see God.
[1:17:10] So the Greeks heard about
[1:17:13] Jesus that he healed the
[1:17:17] sick, made the blind
[1:17:21] see. They saw all the
[1:17:24] miracles. So they were convinced that no
[1:17:28] man can do these
[1:17:30] things except
[1:17:33] God. He raised the
[1:17:36] dead. They said, "We want to see God.
[1:17:40] But they could not see
[1:17:41] him. And the prophet says both of them
[1:17:44] were
[1:17:47] right. One saw a man, one saw
[1:17:52] God. Hallelujah. Amen. I will pass
[1:17:56] here. Now the prophet
[1:18:01] says after his burial and
[1:18:08] resurrection he came back
[1:18:12] as the son of
[1:18:16] God. Yes.
[1:18:19] after his burial and
[1:18:23] resurrection and the prophet says it was
[1:18:27] God acting
[1:18:30] through men.
[1:18:33] So during the seven church
[1:18:36] ages it was the son of
[1:18:41] God acting
[1:18:46] through Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:51] Then it says
[1:18:54] again, he return
[1:18:57] as son of man.
[1:19:02] So in the last
[1:19:05] days he is
[1:19:07] revealed as son of
[1:19:10] man. Amen. And remember when is revealed
[1:19:15] as son of man,
[1:19:18] it is God
[1:19:20] acting in a man.
[1:19:24] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:28] I also want to pass this area.
[1:19:37] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:40] I want to approach the closing.
[1:19:47] Let us look at John the
[1:19:52] Baptist. Now John the Baptist
[1:19:56] the prophet says he will never had known
[1:20:00] Jesus
[1:20:03] if it hadn't been for the Holy Ghost
[1:20:06] pointing him out.
[1:20:12] That's Christ is the mystery of God
[1:20:15] revealed
[1:20:17] faithfully 46. So for John to recognize
[1:20:22] him, the Holy Ghost had to point him
[1:20:26] out.
[1:20:29] You know, the prophet
[1:20:31] says the the Samaritan
[1:20:35] woman for him for her to recognize
[1:20:40] Jesus, it was because she was
[1:20:45] predestined. But the prophet says there
[1:20:48] was something in
[1:20:51] her to
[1:20:53] believe. Hallelujah. So something in her
[1:20:59] When that thing was activated,
[1:21:05] she recognized.
[1:21:09] So that means you must have something in
[1:21:13] you to recognize him.
[1:21:18] So John the Baptist
[1:21:21] that great prophet that came
[1:21:25] forth said there's one standing among
[1:21:27] you right
[1:21:30] now ordinary
[1:21:32] man standing here
[1:21:35] somewhere that's the lamb of
[1:21:40] God and John
[1:21:42] says I bear
[1:21:44] record I saw the spirit of
[1:21:47] God, the Holy Ghost descending from
[1:21:51] heaven like
[1:21:53] a went upon
[1:21:56] him. What was it? It was the Holy
[1:22:00] Ghost pointing him
[1:22:04] out. So that means without the Holy
[1:22:07] Ghost, John could not
[1:22:11] recognize. So the Holy Ghost pointed him
[1:22:15] out.
[1:22:17] Amen. Amen. Amen. My brother, let's go
[1:22:20] to the second diagram.
[1:22:27] I'm preparing to close.
[1:22:36] Uh we read again in the book of uh who
[1:22:40] is this
[1:22:41] MelkiseDC? Who is this
[1:22:44] Melisedc? Now it says
[1:22:48] I believe
[1:22:50] is paragraph
[1:22:52] 68 paragraph 68.
[1:22:58] You
[1:23:00] became from the
[1:23:04] attribute to the flesh.
[1:23:07] The prophet says
[1:23:10] just like Adam,
[1:23:12] we bypassed our theoph.
[1:23:17] So we read the scripture that
[1:23:20] says he chose us in
[1:23:23] him before the
[1:23:26] foundation. So the prophet
[1:23:28] says we became
[1:23:32] from the attribute
[1:23:36] to the
[1:23:37] flesh to be
[1:23:39] tempted. And he
[1:23:42] says you will never be the
[1:23:47] weight
[1:23:49] unless you was a thought at the
[1:23:51] beginning.
[1:23:55] So we became from
[1:23:57] attribute to
[1:24:00] flesh
[1:24:01] and from
[1:24:04] flesh we go to the
[1:24:07] way. You know, I enjoyed
[1:24:10] that lovely voice of our
[1:24:16] pastor when he was reading a quotation.
[1:24:23] He said, "Here is the secret.
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:27] The word is in the bride."
[1:24:33] Hallelujah. Amen. Now we became from the
[1:24:36] attribute
[1:24:38] to the
[1:24:39] flesh going to the
[1:24:42] way. So the prophet says you will never
[1:24:47] be the way
[1:24:50] unless you was a thought at the
[1:24:54] beginning. You know the pastor read a
[1:24:57] scripture for us
[1:25:00] uh in the book of Ecclesiastes.
[1:25:03] If we can just read that scripture
[1:25:06] chapter 3, just read it my brother from
[1:25:10] verse
[1:25:11] 14. I know that whatsoever God doeth, it
[1:25:15] shall be forever. Nothing can be put to
[1:25:18] it, nor anything taken from it, and God
[1:25:22] doeth it that men should fear before
[1:25:25] him. That which have been is now, and
[1:25:29] that which is to be hath already been,
[1:25:33] and God requireth that which is past.
[1:25:36] You see, we we became from the attribute
[1:25:41] to the
[1:25:44] flesh. And to the fle from the flesh to
[1:25:47] the way.
[1:25:49] Now to go to the
[1:25:51] word it
[1:25:54] says it must be from the
[1:25:57] attribute because God
[1:26:01] requires that which has
[1:26:05] been. So the prophet says you will never
[1:26:08] be the
[1:26:10] way unless you was a thought at the
[1:26:14] beginning. So the only way that you can
[1:26:17] become the
[1:26:18] way is only if you were part of
[1:26:22] him is only if you were part of his
[1:26:28] thoughts. That is if you were an
[1:26:32] attribute in him then you can
[1:26:36] become. Now the prophet says and I want
[1:26:40] to read this uh it's paragraph 71.
[1:26:45] Paragraph 71. Uh, who is this Melkisedc?
[1:26:48] Who is this Melkisedc? It says, look,
[1:26:51] when this body,
[1:26:55] this is flesh. Now when this
[1:26:58] body when you are in the flesh when you
[1:27:02] receive the spirit of
[1:27:05] God the immortal life inside of
[1:27:11] you see because you became from
[1:27:14] attribute
[1:27:16] flesh there's an inside
[1:27:19] life there's not a
[1:27:21] life now it says when the Holy Spirit
[1:27:27] comes, it throws this body in subjection
[1:27:31] to
[1:27:33] God because there was an immortal life
[1:27:37] in you
[1:27:40] laying
[1:27:41] dormant. But when you receive the Holy
[1:27:45] Ghost, that immortal life is
[1:27:49] activated now. It throws this
[1:27:53] body in subjection to God because you
[1:27:57] were part of his attributes.
[1:28:01] You know in the spoken word rapture
[1:28:05] page 28 paragraph 144 page 28 paragraph
[1:28:09] 144 it says you say I got the
[1:28:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost that don't
[1:28:18] mean you are
[1:28:20] saved you see it says the rain falls on
[1:28:24] the just and unjust.
[1:28:28] So one can receive the baptism of
[1:28:32] the but nothing is
[1:28:35] activated because there is no immortal
[1:28:39] life laying
[1:28:42] down but another one became from the
[1:28:47] attribute to flesh and there's an
[1:28:50] immortal
[1:28:51] life when the holy ghost
[1:28:54] come it activate that immortal life
[1:28:59] And it says
[1:29:02] it throws this
[1:29:04] body in
[1:29:09] subjection. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:29:12] Amen. Amen. Let's just read the last
[1:29:16] thing here.
[1:29:20] Amen. Amen. We are still on this
[1:29:23] diagram.
[1:29:27] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:29] I want
[1:29:32] to read uh this
[1:29:36] part that we bypassed
[1:29:40] and we shall close.
[1:29:46] It says page 20
[1:29:50] Hebrews Hebrews.
[1:29:56] Here is what happened.
[1:30:00] And the prophet says, I just get on
[1:30:04] this.
[1:30:06] This just get me right where I love it.
[1:30:10] The logos
[1:30:12] and this great fountain.
[1:30:15] This great fountain of
[1:30:18] spirit which had no beginning or no
[1:30:22] end, this great spirit
[1:30:26] began to form in the
[1:30:29] creation and the
[1:30:32] logos that went
[1:30:35] out from
[1:30:38] it that went out from it
[1:30:42] was it was the only visible
[1:30:46] form the spirit
[1:30:48] had and it was a
[1:30:51] theophony. So the Lord Jesus
[1:30:54] Christ did not bypass
[1:30:58] this. He came as the
[1:31:01] word but with us we bypassed that
[1:31:07] visible form.
[1:31:11] So from we became from the
[1:31:15] attribute to flesh.
[1:31:17] But the Lord Jesus Christ I remember the
[1:31:20] pastor showed us in a diagrammatic
[1:31:24] form to say he
[1:31:28] became and did not bypass the
[1:31:32] theophanop but with us we
[1:31:37] became but we bypassed the theophan.
[1:31:42] so that we can be tempted.
[1:31:46] So the theophony
[1:31:48] it is the visible
[1:31:51] form of the spirit.
[1:31:56] It is the only visible
[1:31:58] form of the
[1:32:04] spirit which is a body.
[1:32:08] The body was like a man.
[1:32:11] And even
[1:32:13] Moses saw the back part of a
[1:32:18] man. And the prophet says it was the
[1:32:21] theophony of
[1:32:24] God. And the prophet says is the same
[1:32:28] type of
[1:32:29] body that we
[1:32:32] receive when we
[1:32:35] die. Amen.
[1:32:38] So the prophet says
[1:32:42] potentially let me read this because I
[1:32:46] remember read
[1:32:48] it. He was preaching about the attribute
[1:32:51] of
[1:32:52] God and the pastor also read
[1:32:57] it. Paragraph 65. Paragraph 65. When
[1:33:02] Abraham met him,
[1:33:04] he was Melisedc.
[1:33:07] And it says he unfolds
[1:33:11] here what all the
[1:33:14] attributes will do in the
[1:33:19] final. You see in the final
[1:33:21] end the pastor always
[1:33:24] says have you
[1:33:28] met since you
[1:33:30] believe because it
[1:33:33] unfolds what all the
[1:33:36] attributes will do in the final
[1:33:40] age. If you did not become from the
[1:33:45] attributes then you cannot meet
[1:33:48] me because all the
[1:33:51] attributes in the final end they must
[1:33:58] meet and when Abra Abraham met
[1:34:01] him he was a
[1:34:04] man he was meed.
[1:34:09] So now all the
[1:34:12] attributes that became from him in the
[1:34:15] final end they must met
[1:34:20] him. Every son of
[1:34:23] Abraham, every son of the
[1:34:25] faith absolutely do the same
[1:34:29] thing that Abraham
[1:34:31] did. May the Lord richly bless you.
[1:34:42] as we stand on our
[1:34:44] feet and just to worship the
[1:34:49] Lord as I hand over
[1:34:53] to may the Lord richly bless
[1:34:56] you. My brother, whatever song is in
[1:34:59] your heart,
[1:35:06] [Music]
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:22] alone. For without
[1:35:25] you, for
[1:35:28] without you
[1:35:32] I can
[1:35:36] I can never
[1:35:39] I can
[1:35:42] never

[1:36:19] Lord, for
[1:36:22] without you,

[1:36:31] I can
[1:36:32] never I can

[1:36:51] can we walk with you Jesus?
[1:36:58] Oh,
[1:36:59] [Music]
[1:37:12] without you Lord.
[1:37:16] Without you,
[1:37:19] [Applause]
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:24] I can
[1:37:27] I
[1:37:30] can sing one more time.
[1:37:37] Oh, please let me walk with you.
[1:37:43] Please let me walk with you Jesus.
[1:37:51] [Music]
[1:38:04] Oh, without you Lord.
[1:38:09] [Music]
[1:38:12] [Applause]
[1:38:14] [Music]
[1:38:21] I can.
[1:38:24] [Music]
[1:38:36] Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you so
[1:38:41] much. God has used you.
[1:38:49] We really like to thank the pastor such
[1:38:52] a potential
[1:38:56] and you have done it. God bless you so
[1:38:59] much. Amen. We just want to thank the
[1:39:02] Lord.
[1:39:05] I will ask our
[1:39:09] elder just to come and
[1:39:12] pray after such a wonderful
[1:39:15] word. And I believe all of us we are
[1:39:18] blessed.
[1:39:21] [Applause]
[1:39:27] While he's still coming,
[1:39:29] he touched me.
[1:39:31] He touched me. Oh yes, Lord.
[1:39:39] He touched me.
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:45] They
[1:39:48] know
[1:39:51] that my
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:40:04] soul
[1:40:07] and I
[1:40:09] [Music]
[1:40:11] know he touched me.
[1:40:17] and me.
[1:40:21] My Jesus touched me.
[1:40:25] He touched
[1:40:28] me.
[1:40:31] Oh, he touched me.
[1:40:38] And
[1:40:41] all there's
[1:40:43] joy that floods my soul.
[1:40:47] [Music]
[1:40:49] Something wonderful happened.
[1:40:53] Something wonderful happened.
[1:40:58] And
[1:41:01] I
[1:41:02] [Music]
[1:41:04] know he trusts me.
[1:41:09] [Music]
[1:41:17] [Applause]
[1:41:20] Can we bow our
[1:41:22] heads? Dear heavenly father, thou
[1:41:25] creator of heaven and the
[1:41:29] earth, once again this
[1:41:32] afternoon, we want to thank you. We
[1:41:35] appreciate
[1:41:36] you for your
[1:41:39] presence in our daily life. You walk
[1:41:43] through us. You speak through
[1:41:46] us since you spoke your word in the
[1:41:50] beginning. When you said, "Let us create
[1:41:52] men in our own
[1:41:54] image." Every day, Lord, in our lives,
[1:41:58] while on this earth, you keep on
[1:42:01] changing us, Lord, to your very image.
[1:42:05] Father, we thank you this afternoon for
[1:42:08] the word that was delivered in this
[1:42:10] place. Since from the morning, Father,
[1:42:13] when we came here singing the songs,
[1:42:17] your children sang their hearts
[1:42:21] out. Father, you came mightily and spoke
[1:42:24] to us as it was in the beginning. Lord,
[1:42:29] in this last days, you gave us a
[1:42:31] prophet. Lord, who preached the message
[1:42:34] the unveiled God,
[1:42:37] the unveiling of God, Lord, the God who
[1:42:40] has emoted himself, who was every time
[1:42:44] changing his
[1:42:47] mark and to know which God we serve,
[1:42:51] the God who is a light,
[1:42:54] with a supernatural light,
[1:42:57] When there was nothing on this world,
[1:42:59] Father, you spoke your word and your
[1:43:03] word was the logos.
[1:43:05] Hallelujah. And your word was the spirit
[1:43:08] and there was a man that you created.
[1:43:12] That man you partnershipped him, Lord.
[1:43:14] You placed him in the garden of Eden. It
[1:43:17] was Adam himself, Lord.
[1:43:21] And you used to come and visit him.
[1:43:24] Your voice walked in the garden of Eden.
[1:43:29] Father, we are glad
[1:43:30] today you said men of
[1:43:33] old, the Job, the prophets were looking
[1:43:37] Lord for this day when the sons and sons
[1:43:42] and daughters of God are manifesting
[1:43:45] you, Lord. We thank you for the word. We
[1:43:49] thank you for the songs and we believe
[1:43:52] that word has find a dwelling place in
[1:43:54] our
[1:43:55] hearts because you saw in
[1:43:58] us that it was like you Lord in these
[1:44:02] last days. Father, we thank you for our
[1:44:05] pastor, for the prophet that you sent,
[1:44:08] for elders, preachers, Lord, who can
[1:44:12] stand and minister your word. And that
[1:44:16] word is busy every day healing us in our
[1:44:19] souls,
[1:44:21] restoring us, Lord.
[1:44:24] Finally, Lord, we thank you. We run
[1:44:27] short of words to express how we feel.
[1:44:32] We can go on and on. Father, bless the
[1:44:35] church. Bless every sister and a
[1:44:37] brother. Bless our precious deacon mas
[1:44:42] for delivering this message. And bless
[1:44:44] our pastor, for seeing in him that this

[1:44:57] globe, Father. all the elders Lord where

[1:45:03] eyewitnesses
[1:45:04] of this great message the word of God in
[1:45:08] Africa I remember very well when we went
[1:45:11] in Cameroon how they receive us father
[1:45:15] with a pastor being invested there
[1:45:18] father things were happening father
[1:45:21] until today you are looking at Africa
[1:45:25] Africa has been saved of grief. Africa
[1:45:28] has been restored because the message
[1:45:30] has reached us and we know who we were,
[1:45:34] where we come from, where we are going
[1:45:36] to. Bless your word that has come forth
[1:45:40] and bless each and everyone as we are

[1:46:15] but when when the deacon was preaching
[1:46:21] here you know I said to
[1:46:24] myself and I'm asking my brother just to

[1:46:28] you to sing this song and then the last
[1:46:35] one I am in this message by

[1:46:46] such if it was not
[1:46:49] the message of the hour.
