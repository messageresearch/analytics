[1:54:15] said thou Simon son
[1:54:19] of from now your name be
[1:54:23] changed you'll be

[1:54:28] immediately he didn't even ask him would
[1:54:32] you like you me to change
[1:54:37] your you call him Peter
[1:54:40] today Peter the Lord changed his
[1:54:45] name Simon to
[1:54:47] Peter is Peter in
[1:54:49] English who changed his name
[1:54:53] am he said here amen thou shall be
[1:54:59] called hallelujah
[1:55:01] amen what if uh uh he was an
[1:55:08] unbeliever that would have been a
[1:55:11] struggle you know this name it was given
[1:55:13] to me by my uncle
[1:55:17] and let me apply to the government if
[1:55:20] they can change the name
[1:55:26] immediately Peter caught up to the
[1:55:29] Revelation this is a
[1:55:31] messiah what he calls me that I will
[1:55:37] be amen amen so he was exposing look
[1:55:41] here Jesus never tried to expose
[1:55:46] anything about this Messiah being him
[1:55:49] being a messiah to people who didn't
[1:55:51] believe him
[1:55:57] amen that's why
[1:56:00] when when Philip was
[1:56:03] calling Philip knowing that is a
[1:56:07] Believer he told him one
[1:56:09] thing wait my brother just come and
[1:56:13] see as soon as he came he didn't need
[1:56:17] Phil to tell him again about
[1:56:19] that because him was a believer
[1:56:22] he CAU up with the
[1:56:24] Revelation this is the
[1:56:26] Messiah amen amen and he declared
[1:56:33] himself he said
[1:56:36] Rabbi thou are the king of
[1:56:39] [Music]
[1:56:41] Israel after just being the
[1:56:45] message he didn't have those uh things
[1:56:48] which we people are talking about
[1:56:52] you you'll be wondering are we in the
[1:56:55] message or in a political
[1:57:02] party we are supposed to be
[1:57:05] Believers a Believer shall be known by
[1:57:08] the signs and
[1:57:14] wonders not not about the way he looks
[1:57:18] like which gives advantage to somebody
[1:57:20] who looks like me
[1:57:23] look are nothing my brother you
[1:57:25] know it's a word amen say Amen everybody
[1:57:31] amen amen God does not go into
[1:57:38] looks God goes for the
[1:57:42] inside you can see
[1:57:46] outside God is looking the
[1:57:48] inside the believer inside
[1:57:52] you can condemn the
[1:57:53] outside but the
[1:57:55] inside is what God is looking
[1:57:59] at in the inside is a part of
[1:58:05] him hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[1:58:08] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[1:58:11] hallelujah
[1:58:14] amen how do you know that inside of
[1:58:19] you there is
[1:58:25] God amen amen amen amen let me start
[1:58:30] again how do you know that inside of
[1:58:33] you there is God what was inside you
[1:58:39] theen there was theop hallelujah amen
[1:58:44] hallelujah amen what
[1:58:46] is the word body
[1:58:50] body amen the word body
[1:58:55] subject amen amen amen regardless of
[1:58:58] whatever anybody tells
[1:59:01] you my sister my brother if you are
[1:59:06] subject to the
[1:59:08] word you are going to
[1:59:16] heaven regardless whatever everyone
[1:59:18] tells
[1:59:19] you but you are not subject to the way
[1:59:24] there's a danger
[1:59:26] there because what we
[1:59:30] lost what Adam lost was
[1:59:34] the the Adam of genesis:
[1:59:40] 126 the one which the one who came from
[1:59:44] Heaven the one which was Adam that
[1:59:49] time was from the soil
[1:59:52] [Music]
[1:59:53] amen amen so you know soils each soil
[1:59:57] behaves the way it
[2:00:00] is amen because those of you who are
[2:00:04] agriculturist here you
[2:00:06] know before you plant anything in the
[2:00:09] soil you have to test it so South
[2:00:12] African
[2:00:16] soil even in South Africa here there are
[2:00:18] so many soils different
[2:00:22] they behave
[2:00:24] differently according to according to
[2:00:27] the which you took it
[2:00:29] from so the which God
[2:00:32] said you are going to return to the
[2:00:36] soil is a the of Genesis
[2:00:41] 2 but the one of
[2:00:45] genesis6 return back to
[2:00:49] God now what is
[2:00:52] the theop now
[2:00:55] the it's a body is what type of body
[2:00:59] subject it's a word body
[2:01:03] subject to the word amen so if our body
[2:01:08] was going to come from
[2:01:10] Heaven what will come from
[2:01:13] Heaven the word the F that's why when
[2:01:18] the Seven Seals came
[2:01:22] call
[2:01:23] them they
[2:01:25] titled because now the word
[2:01:29] in
[2:01:31] in is being restored back to
[2:01:36] man amen the F in
[2:01:39] F is the word of God in
[2:01:43] F being restored
[2:01:48] back amen amen and the Bible says
[2:01:52] behold the Tabernacle of God is with
