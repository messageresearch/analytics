[13:03] [Music]
[13:32] [Music]
[13:35] Greetings saints in the name of our Lord
[13:37] and Savior Jesus Christ.
[13:42] I was listening to the songs as they
[13:46] follow.
[13:47] Brother Muzi starting with
[13:50] the new Jerusalem
[13:53] 12 gates, three on each side and there
[13:56] follows
[14:02] with a song about heaven.
[14:05] So as we
[14:08] are longing for that city, there are
[14:10] battles that we are fighting.
[14:15] Ours
[14:21] is to trust Guluru
[14:24] has done the job for us.
[14:29] He has won the war for us. Of course,
[14:35] there'll be services of battles that
[14:37] we'll fight
[14:40] but
[14:44] September because he gave a promise that
[14:49] I will not leave you comfortless
[14:54] but I will send you the comfort and he
[14:57] will be with you until the end of time.
[15:02] So as we fight, as we forge on,
[15:08] the promise is there.
[15:14] Individually we have we are fighting
[15:16] battles.
[15:19] We as we are gathered here in this place
[15:23] [Music]
[15:25] in this tabernacle individually
[15:32] But you know God is faithful.
[15:38] God is faithful
[15:41] and
[15:42] he is
[15:46] through him. It is through him
[15:51] because of what he has done.
[15:56] So the song says, "I'm rejoicing
[16:01] night and day
[16:03] as I walk this narrow way.
[16:08] For the hand of God, they know my life I
[16:15] see."
[16:17] [Music]
[16:19] And the reason
[16:22] for me please yes the secret
[16:27] all is this
[16:30] that the comfort
[16:33] abides

[45:15] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And
[45:17] those that are healed are sick this
[45:20] morning.

[45:46] Our conscience are clear. Our hearts are
[45:49] full of joy because you cannot enter
[45:52] this church and go home the same.
[45:54] Amen.
[45:55] There should be a change and
[45:57] transformation in your life. We love you
[46:00] once more, Lord God, as we put
[46:03] everything unto your capable hand in the
[46:05] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[46:07] Christ. Amen. Amen.
[46:10] Amen.
[46:12] [Applause]
[46:13] Let's open our Bible,
[46:17] the book of Revelation 8
[46:22] only verse 13.
[46:26] Amen.
[46:27] Revelation 8:3.
[46:30] And I beheld and heard an angel flying
[46:33] through the midst of heaven, saying with
[46:36] a loud voice, who who to the inhabitants
[46:40] of the earth by raisin of the other
[46:44] voices of the trumpet of the three
[46:47] angels which are yet to sound.
[46:50] Amen. You may be seated.
[46:56] uh won't take much of your time,
[46:59] but we are at church
[47:02] to speak about our Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:06] Amen.
[47:07] Amen.
[47:07] When you come to church,
[47:10] you listen to the word uttered first,
[47:15] then the entire message
[47:18] until to the end. then you can have the
[47:22] understanding.
[47:24] Without that, you won't understand.
[47:28] Amen.
[47:28] Amen.
[47:29] So take this scripture that we just read
[47:34] and connect with the other verses,
[47:38] take the the code that has been read
[47:42] and connect with other quotes,
[47:46] then you understand.
[47:48] Amen.
[47:49] Amen.
[47:51] Chapter 9
[47:54] verse 12.
[47:56] Verse 12.
[47:57] Amen.
[47:58] Revelation chapter 9:12.
[48:01] One who is passed and behold there come
[48:05] two who more hereafter.
[48:07] Amen.
[48:08] Amen.
[48:10] Chapter 11.
[48:11] Revelation 11
[48:13] verse 14.
[48:14] Verse 14.
[48:17] The second W is passed and behold the
[48:20] third W cometh quickly.
[48:23] Amen.
[48:23] Amen.
[48:25] Chapter 16.
[48:27] Revelation chapter 16.
[48:29] Verse 16.
[48:31] Verse 16.
[48:37] And he gathered them together into a
[48:40] place called in the Hebrew tongue
[48:42] Armageddon.
[48:43] Amen.
[48:44] Amen. That's what we're going to talk
[48:46] about this morning.
[48:48] Continuing from the previous message we
[48:50] spoke about
[48:54] about the simultaneous appearance of our
[48:56] Lord Jesus Christ.
[49:00] We were focusing on Gog and Magog
[49:05] looking at what is happening today.
[49:08] Now today we will speak about the war of
[49:12] Armageddon.
[49:15] is the continuity.
[49:17] Amen.
[49:18] Amen. So that's our message today
[49:22] because uh brother Brennham
[49:26] will was teaching us you know the pastor
[49:30] is always teaching us
[49:33] that always speak about this
[49:37] the you know the sequence of events
[49:42] showing you that we were there
[49:46] now we are here the next will be there
[49:50] until we go on eternity.
[49:53] So I love to do some researches of what
[49:57] is happening.
[50:00] I mean in my time
[50:03] uh I love to do some researches
[50:07] what is happening in the world
[50:10] and check what the Bible says
[50:13] and check what the brother said
[50:16] and then you will definitely know in the
[50:19] time you are living in.
[50:22] Amen. Amen. The war of Armageddon
[50:26] is something
[50:28] that will happen
[50:31] is something that other people speak
[50:34] about it
[50:36] but others do not have the understanding
[50:39] but we have we thank God because we know
[50:42] better.
[50:44] When the seals were open
[50:47] we started to see clearly.
[50:51] Amen. Amen. So now when we were talking
[50:56] about G and
[50:59] it's it's a war not the world war
[51:04] no
[51:05] but it's war
[51:07] when Russia
[51:09] will be fighting there in Israel it's
[51:13] only that is and brother Brenham says
[51:19] watch the king of the north
[51:21] watch Russia
[51:23] It start and ends there but another war
[51:28] will come war of Armageddon.
[51:32] That's what we'll talk about today.
[51:34] Let's read what brother Brennham says
[51:37] from the fourth seal. He says now the
[51:42] battle started in heaven.
[51:46] Do you understand?
[51:47] Amen. it it will be finished
[51:50] on earth
[51:52] in the form of
[51:58] meaning the angelic war
[52:02] become the natural war.
[52:08] Amen. Amen.
[52:10] Now let's watch and see it unfold.
[52:15] And maybe
[52:17] we can unfold it if the Lord help us
[52:22] right now to do this now. So watch it
[52:27] unfold.
[52:29] Amen. Amen. That was brother
[52:32] in 1963.
[52:34] Now today is 2025.
[52:37] We see it happening.
[52:39] right in our heart.
[52:42] Amen.
[52:42] Amen.
[52:44] Raising Jar's daughter's
[52:49] daughter,
[52:49] brother Brennham says,
[52:51] "Did you hear the new cast tonight?
[52:56] Did you read your newspaper?
[52:59] The whole world
[53:01] is in a tumor
[53:04] on the Swiss canal
[53:06] canal. There's a third world war coming
[53:09] up,
[53:12] an atomic war.
[53:15] And while she's brewing,
[53:19] what can happen? It lays in who shoot
[53:23] the first atomic bomb.
[53:29] Do you understand?
[53:32] Something is happening.
[53:34] Many places
[53:37] are hottest
[53:39] it ever been in that time.
[53:44] Why? Their atomic bomb
[53:48] has already got
[53:50] this world moving
[53:54] from its orbit
[53:57] into the sun.
[53:59] It's like God said it will be Amen.
[54:05] Amen.
[54:06] Amen.
[54:09] Brother Brenham says,
[54:11] "Did you hear the new cast tonight?
[54:16] Did you read the newspaper?
[54:20] If you don't listen to the news, if you
[54:24] don't read the newspaper,
[54:26] you won't know."
[54:30] Amen.
[54:31] Amen.
[54:31] But if you read
[54:34] and compare with the coach
[54:36] and with the Bible, you will definitely
[54:39] know
[54:41] because what we are talking about this
[54:42] morning
[54:44] are the things that are happening in our
[54:47] eyes. So we know because when we read
[54:51] our newspaper, we check what the Bible
[54:53] says, then we started, we start to know.
[55:01] Uh then what come
[55:04] now? Luke
[55:06] when I think of this, my heart jumps.
[55:11] Now he said, "Hold the four winds
[55:16] until
[55:18] in other words
[55:20] we seal the servant of God of our God
[55:26] in their forehead.
[55:30] The seventh
[55:33] the seventh
[55:34] the Jews." John 10 and say
[55:39] I seen 140,000 sealed away
[55:43] 140,000.
[55:45] Now the wind all started in
[55:50] they would have covered the earth
[55:53] until the battle of Armageddon
[55:56] would have took place
[55:59] in the first world war.
[56:03] Brother says
[56:05] but
[56:07] amen.
[56:08] Amen.
[56:08] Do you read the Bible?
[56:10] It speaks about three ws
[56:13] the first one has happened. The two
[56:18] remaining.
[56:19] Amen. Amen. God could have finished the
[56:22] world
[56:24] in the first world war
[56:28] but he couldn't because two wars
[56:33] must come. So the the first world war
[56:38] came and other countries
[56:42] raised the flag saying to the world we
[56:46] have won. So there were winners
[56:50] in the first world war but millions of
[56:53] people
[56:55] were dead.
[56:56] Amen.
[56:57] Amen.
[56:58] I think it was between
[57:02] 1914
[57:05] to 1918.
[57:08] And then comes the second world war
[57:11] that started in 1939
[57:14] and finished in 1945.
[57:17] Certain countries
[57:19] raised the flag
[57:22] and said we have won.
[57:25] Amen. Amen. meaning we dominated the
[57:28] entire world.
[57:30] Now the Bible speaks about
[57:33] the third wam
[57:36] speaks about the third world war. Then
[57:40] he said on the third world war.
[57:43] Amen. Amen. Is the quote I read
[57:48] but I will read it again
[57:51] for your understanding.
[57:53] The whole world is in a tumor
[57:59] on the Swiss canal.
[58:01] There's a third world war.
[58:04] That third world war is an atomic war.
[58:11] The atomic war
[58:14] to be honest with you this morning,
[58:17] there's no winner.
[58:19] It's an atomic war.
[58:22] It finished the entire world.
[58:27] If the first and the second
[58:30] they were winners, but the third there's
[58:34] no winner
[58:36] because
[58:38] the the the atomic bomb
[58:42] ballistics missile
[58:46] it has been built
[58:49] for their own destruction.
[58:55] Israel.
[58:56] Israel
[58:57] fought Iran.
[59:00] Let me just give you small background.
[59:04] Iran
[59:06] is the old patient.
[59:10] Now what happened or the relationship
[59:15] between Iran
[59:17] and Israel
[59:18] in the olden days?
[59:22] God allowed Nebuchadnezzar
[59:25] to strike Israel
[59:28] and take them
[59:29] for captivity
[59:32] again. Amen.
[59:33] Then they stayed there. You remember the
[59:36] story of Daniel
[59:40] and they were in captive
[59:44] and God allowed it.
[59:47] while Nebasar was there.
[59:50] Amen. Amen.
[59:51] The Iranians
[59:53] of today being the patients, the me and
[59:57] the patient, they invaded Babylon.
[1:00:01] When they invade Babylon, they captured
[1:00:05] people from Babylon. And the Israelites
[1:00:09] were there as well. And they stayed in
[1:00:12] Persia being the Iran of today.
[1:00:17] I'm taking you somewhere. Just go with
[1:00:19] me.
[1:00:20] Amen.
[1:00:21] When the Israelites
[1:00:23] are in Iran,
[1:00:25] they studied Iran,
[1:00:29] if there is a nation that is wise today,
[1:00:33] even in the olden days is Israel. But
[1:00:36] God said today, when you go to captive,
[1:00:41] don't show them that you are able to do
[1:00:45] this and that. Just tell them you are
[1:00:48] the shepherd of the sheep.
[1:00:51] But when you look at the test today,
[1:00:54] the most intelligent
[1:00:57] scientist
[1:00:59] in the entire world are Jewish people.
[1:01:04] The most richest people in the world are
[1:01:08] are Jewish people.
[1:01:11] So when they are in Iran, they study
[1:01:14] Iran. and they hold strategic positions.
[1:01:22] The king of Babylon relied on Daniel
[1:01:27] right there. Now when they get to I mean
[1:01:31] Persia being Iran of today they still on
[1:01:35] that position that God has given them in
[1:01:39] the government.
[1:01:41] I was checking how they killed
[1:01:45] the scientist in Iran
[1:01:47] and the commanders in Iran in one night.
[1:01:52] That thing you look at your naked eye.
[1:01:57] It's impossible. But the Israelites
[1:02:00] did it
[1:02:03] because they studied a nation and they
[1:02:07] strike. And when they strike
[1:02:10] You will feel it.
[1:02:13] Many of you do not know. I was studying
[1:02:17] the Jewish community.
[1:02:20] I want to tell you that nation
[1:02:23] has built the world.
[1:02:26] This world, you like it or not is owned
[1:02:30] by that small nation.
[1:02:34] You in South Africa, you call the white
[1:02:37] people the buas, the farmers. Did you
[1:02:42] know that those people are Jewish?
[1:02:49] You didn't know
[1:02:52] Jewish
[1:02:54] built South Africa.
[1:02:57] Speak was built by the Jewish. Those
[1:03:00] farmers,
[1:03:02] the fun
[1:03:04] The rubbert, the ghostain,
[1:03:07] the borders
[1:03:09] are Jewish name.
[1:03:11] Go and check them.
[1:03:14] Those farms.
[1:03:17] You just saw Mr. Speaking Africans,
[1:03:22] go and praise him
[1:03:24] is a Jew.
[1:03:27] Amen. Amen.
[1:03:28] So if South Africa can try to strike
[1:03:31] them,
[1:03:34] they won't in government is them.
[1:03:38] You know, Tony Leon
[1:03:40] is a Jew. TA party
[1:03:44] was formed by the Jew.
[1:03:48] Amen.
[1:03:49] Try them.
[1:03:50] You will see.
[1:03:59] the president of Ukraine.
[1:04:01] It's a Jew.
[1:04:04] You go to America.
[1:04:06] Joe,
[1:04:08] he's a Jew.
[1:04:12] You go to London stock exchange.
[1:04:15] Stock exchange. London
[1:04:17] owned by the Jews.
[1:04:19] You go to America.
[1:04:21] The stock exchange. Stock in New York
[1:04:25] owned by the Jewish.
[1:04:27] You come to South Africa
[1:04:30] stock exchange
[1:04:31] owned by the Jews. You go to Germany.
[1:04:35] The reason why Hitler started the war
[1:04:40] and killed those people is because of
[1:04:42] the Jewish. He said to the Germans,
[1:04:46] "These people are taking over our
[1:04:48] country. We need to eliminate them. You
[1:04:52] can kill their body,
[1:04:54] their spirit, but their souls are the
[1:04:57] Jewish undo them. So the world is owned
[1:05:03] by the Jewish.
[1:05:04] You like it or not, you go to Africa,
[1:05:07] you go to Europe, go to America, go to
[1:05:10] Britain, is there. Amen.
[1:05:14] Amen.
[1:05:15] But it's just a small country.
[1:05:18] That is why the Gog and Magog will be
[1:05:22] fighting there.
[1:05:24] That is why the Armageddon will start
[1:05:28] there.
[1:05:30] Amen.
[1:05:31] Amen.
[1:05:31] Now let's go again.
[1:05:34] So those uh people are the people of
[1:05:38] God, the nation of God.
[1:05:41] You like it or not, God has chosen
[1:05:45] like us.
[1:05:47] God chose us.
[1:05:50] He's not going to judge the world
[1:05:53] through Roman Catholic Church or Baptist
[1:05:58] or faith mission but by his way and we
[1:06:02] are his way.
[1:06:04] So he's going to judge the world
[1:06:07] with us.
[1:06:10] You you like it or not.
[1:06:12] Amen.
[1:06:13] Amen.
[1:06:14] I think it was in 1992.
[1:06:17] I was with my uncle.
[1:06:20] I didn't I couldn't differentiate
[1:06:22] between
[1:06:26] the American the
[1:06:28] but when I was with uncle we're coming
[1:06:31] from
[1:06:33] using the taxi then in park station then
[1:06:38] my uncle was like he said
[1:06:46] he said
[1:06:47] let me get two brand
[1:06:51] Then we walk around to an inspect.
[1:06:54] Then we enter the shop saying
[1:07:00] bring him what? You know them those
[1:07:04] pulas.
[1:07:06] Then he get in. He found a friend.
[1:07:10] Then he said to white men,
[1:07:14] I need this friend.
[1:07:16] Then he he said yes.
[1:07:19] you saw the price you can pay.
[1:07:23] Then my uncle said, "Yes, I see it, but
[1:07:27] I want to negotiate a little bit."
[1:07:30] And that Jewish man, but I didn't know I
[1:07:32] was a Jewish, but he said to my uncle,
[1:07:35] if you don't pay that price,
[1:07:38] try next door.
[1:07:41] I was listening said,
[1:07:45] "What's happening now?
[1:07:50] Because when coming to money
[1:07:53] they know it and they don't compromise.
[1:07:56] If a Jew person said I need a,000
[1:08:01] you have 999 rand.
[1:08:11] They don't compromise.
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:14] That is the nation that God has put.
[1:08:18] That's what God put us in
[1:08:21] the bride. Do not compromise
[1:08:25] when coming to the word of God.
[1:08:28] Do not compromise.
[1:08:31] But go to the Indian shop,
[1:08:35] you will you will negotiate
[1:08:38] and negotiate and negotiate. You will
[1:08:41] end up getting it for free.
[1:08:47] not with a Jew.
[1:08:51] Amen.
[1:08:52] Amen.
[1:08:52] So now the war that we are heading to
[1:08:57] the third world war
[1:09:02] is atomic.
[1:09:04] the atomic bombs or the atomic missile.
[1:09:09] They just set them from the office
[1:09:14] and you know look at the Google map
[1:09:18] and they can say
[1:09:21] strike mood the entire Lord
[1:09:25] within 5 minutes and no one
[1:09:29] can survive.
[1:09:32] That's how they do it. If you are not
[1:09:34] sure about this, look at your cell
[1:09:37] phone. Your own cell phone is here in
[1:09:40] South Africa. When you cross the border
[1:09:44] of
[1:09:46] it's cut off.
[1:09:48] Did you ever ask yourself why
[1:09:51] there's no fence? There's nothing. But
[1:09:54] it says you are in another country. Cut
[1:09:57] off.
[1:09:59] Those people they they know what they're
[1:10:01] doing.
[1:10:03] Amen.
[1:10:04] Amen.
[1:10:04] The atomic bomb,
[1:10:07] they just like that. They set them for a
[1:10:11] certain destination
[1:10:13] and they will do their job
[1:10:16] and that's all.
[1:10:18] The neighboring city
[1:10:21] will be unharmed.
[1:10:24] But if the target is m
[1:10:28] going to hit the target.
[1:10:31] So I was checking
[1:10:33] while I'm doing some researches about
[1:10:35] this.
[1:10:37] So I've heard the Bible
[1:10:41] is truthful.
[1:10:43] Brother Brenham is truthful because of
[1:10:47] the following.
[1:10:49] They say when I was checking
[1:10:52] Russia has got many missiles
[1:10:56] than any other country.
[1:11:00] They have nuclear bombs
[1:11:03] than any other country.
[1:11:06] They even give numbers but I don't think
[1:11:10] they are precise.
[1:11:12] They give you they give you what you
[1:11:15] want to give you because in the military
[1:11:17] language
[1:11:21] Don't expose yourself to the fullest.
[1:11:25] They say Russia
[1:11:27] has got 5,880
[1:11:30] nuclear bombs.
[1:11:31] 5,880
[1:11:33] nuclear bombs.
[1:11:34] They are there underground.
[1:11:36] Amen.
[1:11:37] Followed by USA, USA, China, China,
[1:11:40] France, UK. They they come on like that.
[1:11:44] Did you ever ask yourself what are those
[1:11:47] things for?
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:52] Amen.
[1:11:53] Amen.
[1:11:53] Those things are the ones
[1:11:57] that will suffocate
[1:11:59] the entire world.
[1:12:04] Amen.
[1:12:04] Amen.
[1:12:05] They are there waiting for the time. And
[1:12:09] I repeat, they won't go
[1:12:13] as long as the bride is still here.
[1:12:18] You see the power that you have, you
[1:12:22] stop. I mean, you know, have you ever
[1:12:24] seen Putin
[1:12:26] when he walks the people normally say
[1:12:30] they will say
[1:12:33] that? They will look at him, his
[1:12:36] bodyguard
[1:12:37] holding the bag. No one knows what is
[1:12:40] inside there.
[1:12:43] But when Donald Trump talk
[1:12:47] smile and say start,
[1:12:50] you will never finish but actually be
[1:12:54] holding his back
[1:12:56] with that kind of a walk.
[1:13:00] The world we are living in
[1:13:03] is on another level is coming to an end.
[1:13:08] Signs and wonders are telling us.
[1:13:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:13:14] Because when the European country
[1:13:19] want to say something about Russia,
[1:13:22] Putin will just say with a smile. No,
[1:13:26] you can start and make sure
[1:13:30] you will finish it.
[1:13:35] Amen.
[1:13:35] Amen.
[1:13:36] Something is about to happen.
[1:13:39] Amen.
[1:13:40] Amen.
[1:13:40] So the the first world war, the second
[1:13:44] world war passed and there were
[1:13:47] casuality.
[1:13:49] One of the rules in the army when you go
[1:13:54] to war, you don't kill children or
[1:13:58] elderly people or women. You just kill
[1:14:01] men.
[1:14:10] But if it's a serious war,
[1:14:14] you kill a child, you kill a woman, you
[1:14:18] kill elderly people and justify it.
[1:14:27] Some other rules
[1:14:29] are there for the sake
[1:14:32] of rule
[1:14:34] when things are happening.
[1:14:37] put them aside
[1:14:39] because other country they use women
[1:14:44] they use kids to fight.
[1:14:50] Let's see what brother Brennham says
[1:14:57] well
[1:14:58] uh
[1:15:03] the question and answers
[1:15:07] Someone was asking question to brother
[1:15:09] Bren
[1:15:11] wanting to know what is happening.
[1:15:13] He said the church age
[1:15:16] ending and has black out.
[1:15:20] The bride is called.
[1:15:22] We have already entered into tribulation
[1:15:25] period is a question.
[1:15:29] Brother says no no no.
[1:15:33] I wish I could have just more time on
[1:15:36] that.
[1:15:39] The bride. Amen.
[1:15:40] The bride when she's taken from the
[1:15:44] church,
[1:15:46] then the church age
[1:15:49] will cease.
[1:15:52] Laia
[1:15:54] goes into chaos.
[1:15:56] The bride goes into glory.
[1:16:00] The tribulation
[1:16:02] set in
[1:16:04] in upon the sleeping vision
[1:16:09] three and a half years
[1:16:12] while Israel
[1:16:15] is getting its prophecy
[1:16:18] when the tribulation set in
[1:16:22] upon Israel and then
[1:16:26] comes the battle
[1:16:28] of Armageddon.
[1:16:30] which destroy
[1:16:33] everything.
[1:16:36] Within three and a half years,
[1:16:40] things will happen.
[1:16:42] Gog and Mog is at the beginning of the
[1:16:46] three and a half years.
[1:16:49] Armageddon is at the end of three and a
[1:16:52] half years because now we are going to
[1:16:56] another level. When we have raptured
[1:17:00] from rapture
[1:17:02] we go after going we go and we are gone.
[1:17:08] We are going somewhere is the message of
[1:17:10] another day. Today I want to talk about
[1:17:14] this war.
[1:17:16] Amen.
[1:17:17] Amen. Victory Day is a a quote
[1:17:21] victory. We talk about
[1:17:24] we have several wars.
[1:17:27] The wars and the rumors of war
[1:17:31] and the V days
[1:17:34] and V days and it will finally went up
[1:17:40] into the great battle of Armageddo.
[1:17:46] That will be the last of it.
[1:17:49] When she come to the battle of Emo
[1:17:53] that settled the whole thing
[1:17:56] just before the millennium
[1:18:00] or after the battle of Armageddon
[1:18:04] is the millennium.
[1:18:06] Armageddon
[1:18:08] is to clean off the earth.
[1:18:12] She purified herself
[1:18:15] with this atomic blowing
[1:18:19] and the volcanic ash.
[1:18:23] And the thing sings this soaked blood of
[1:18:25] men
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:29] and upon the earth and sin and crime.
[1:18:36] He sinks beneath the earth
[1:18:39] and the volcanic breaks out again
[1:18:43] and renew
[1:18:46] and cleans the earth for the great
[1:18:49] millennium.
[1:18:52] Amen. Amen. So millennium when it comes
[1:18:57] it must find earth clean
[1:19:00] and the only thing that can clean the
[1:19:03] earth
[1:19:05] is the war of Armageddon.
[1:19:08] What is the war of Armageddon
[1:19:11] when the world is at war? The entire
[1:19:15] world.
[1:19:17] Well, previously
[1:19:20] I was preaching here about the stage
[1:19:24] of Nepadness.
[1:19:26] Right at the bottom there is iron and
[1:19:29] clay.
[1:19:31] Iron and clay is America and Russia.
[1:19:35] That means there at the end the last war
[1:19:38] that we have shall be America and
[1:19:43] Russia. Now, brother Brenham says the
[1:19:46] eastern country
[1:19:51] is we will get people or other nation to
[1:19:56] back them up. The western country will
[1:20:01] have another nation
[1:20:03] back them this time. There's no neutral
[1:20:07] country.
[1:20:10] Amen. Amen. Maybe uh President Ramaposa
[1:20:13] is streaming
[1:20:15] because last time I said
[1:20:18] South Africa is neutral
[1:20:20] but last week I was reading he says I'm
[1:20:24] pro Iran.
[1:20:27] Yeah.
[1:20:28] Amen.
[1:20:29] Because you don't need to be neutral.
[1:20:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:20:35] Other countries
[1:20:37] will rally behind America.
[1:20:40] other countries will rally behind Russia
[1:20:45] and brother says in his vision I saw
[1:20:49] communism
[1:20:51] Russia
[1:20:52] swallowing everything
[1:20:56] that is why it has more missile and
[1:21:00] atomic and nuclear bomb than any other
[1:21:02] nation.
[1:21:06] Amen. Amen.
[1:21:07] It is the world we are living in.
[1:21:10] So the third world war
[1:21:12] is no neutral country.
[1:21:15] Those that follow the communism
[1:21:18] will rally behind Russia.
[1:21:21] Those that follow
[1:21:24] America will will rally behind Russia.
[1:21:27] And there's war. America is not going to
[1:21:30] win that war. Russia is not going to win
[1:21:33] that.
[1:21:35] NATO country is not going to win that
[1:21:37] war.
[1:21:39] But it will be the end of everything.
[1:21:45] A question again
[1:21:47] to brother.
[1:21:49] Just listen as we go.
[1:21:52] Would you please explain
[1:21:54] how Satan is bound thousand years
[1:22:00] but loosed again
[1:22:02] for the battle of Revelation 208.
[1:22:07] 28 brotherham respond and say that is
[1:22:12] not battle of Armageddon.
[1:22:14] The battle of Armageddon
[1:22:17] takes place on this side
[1:22:21] on this world.
[1:22:24] And when the tribulation period
[1:22:28] is ended, meaning right at the end of
[1:22:34] three and a half years of tribulation
[1:22:38] of rapture
[1:22:41] of Revelation 11,
[1:22:43] then Armageddon
[1:22:46] will come.
[1:22:49] At least you know
[1:22:51] where we are right now when they are
[1:22:55] still talking. They are just preparing
[1:22:59] to fight Israel
[1:23:02] there in the mountain of Megiddon. That
[1:23:06] is not Armageddon.
[1:23:08] That is not the final war. But the final
[1:23:11] war is when the entire world is
[1:23:15] involved.
[1:23:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:23:20] Amen.
[1:23:23] The 70th week of Daniel,
[1:23:26] 70th week of Daniel,
[1:23:27] listen to brother Brennham, brother.
[1:23:30] He said, "And oh, watch this." Two
[1:23:33] prophets
[1:23:35] when they raise up here
[1:23:38] in the middle of the week,
[1:23:41] they cut off like that
[1:23:44] and then start the battle of Armageddon.
[1:23:47] Then God begin to speak himself.
[1:23:51] Then he stand and begin to fight.
[1:23:54] And that prophet are striking the earth.
[1:23:58] They are preaching the name of Jesus
[1:24:00] Christ. They are baptized in the same
[1:24:03] way. They are doing the same thing that
[1:24:07] the first Pentecostal fathers
[1:24:11] did and many
[1:24:14] following them. You know the 70th week
[1:24:17] of Daniel,
[1:24:20] Christ was cut off was supposed to
[1:24:24] preach
[1:24:26] seven years but he preached three and a
[1:24:29] half years so that the gentile can come
[1:24:33] in. When the gentile dispensation
[1:24:37] of that remaining three and a half years
[1:24:41] will come in to make seven years and the
[1:24:45] bride will be gone within that time of
[1:24:49] the cut off all these wars should happen
[1:24:54] and one of them is the war of
[1:24:56] Armageddon. If you see the war of
[1:24:59] Armageddon, you must know that is Christ
[1:25:03] coming again to his nation Israel.
[1:25:07] Israel,
[1:25:10] do you see it?
[1:25:12] Yes.
[1:25:13] Amen.
[1:25:15] The Bible says
[1:25:18] the whole earth
[1:25:20] it is of God
[1:25:23] and all everything in it. And God made
[1:25:27] sure that
[1:25:29] every continent
[1:25:33] should participate
[1:25:35] in this world,
[1:25:37] in the Bible, in his ministry.
[1:25:41] That is why you will see Christ Jesus
[1:25:46] when he was born, he will come to Egypt
[1:25:49] and go back.
[1:25:51] The Jews will be scattered in the entire
[1:25:53] world.
[1:25:55] That is the plan of God.
[1:25:56] Amen.
[1:25:57] Amen.
[1:25:58] Amen.
[1:25:58] Now listen to this.
[1:26:00] Israel
[1:26:02] where it's situated now
[1:26:04] we call it Middle East
[1:26:09] right there in the Middle East. That's
[1:26:12] where things start.
[1:26:14] Amen. Amen. And up there we have Russia
[1:26:19] and China.
[1:26:20] The communist countries. They have a
[1:26:23] part that they are going to play right
[1:26:27] here in the word of God to execute
[1:26:31] what God has done.
[1:26:36] Amen.
[1:26:36] Amen.
[1:26:38] We have America,
[1:26:40] we have Europe,
[1:26:42] we have Africa.
[1:26:44] What is happening? I will show you.
[1:26:48] Amen.
[1:26:50] If you write a novel
[1:26:53] or a play.
[1:26:56] That thing is in your mind. You put it
[1:27:00] in a
[1:27:02] book form.
[1:27:04] Then you want the people to play what
[1:27:09] was in your mind.
[1:27:12] Amen. I'll give you an example.
[1:27:15] those that look at the
[1:27:26] service. Amen.
[1:27:31] So now they will tell you that
[1:27:35] they've seen this today but they want to
[1:27:37] see what will happen tomorrow and what
[1:27:40] will happen tomorrow. You not knowing,
[1:27:43] you find yourself looking at death, not
[1:27:47] knowing what will happen next. But the
[1:27:50] writer has closed the book, he knows
[1:27:54] already what will happen after this and
[1:27:58] after this. Amen. Amen. If they can
[1:28:01] point a gun at someone,
[1:28:04] then you don't know whether he's been
[1:28:06] shot or not. You will love to look at
[1:28:09] the story tomorrow.
[1:28:12] so that you can see the end of what is
[1:28:16] happening. Then that's how the devil did
[1:28:19] that to pull you to look at that and
[1:28:23] forget about the word of God because the
[1:28:26] other people they don't sleep at night
[1:28:29] when they get to work the following day.
[1:28:32] But
[1:28:35] we don't know where that guy.
[1:28:36] I want to look at that today. They just
[1:28:38] put you on suspense.
[1:28:41] and unsuspend and until Amen. Amen. But
[1:28:45] the writer knows what will happen.
[1:28:50] God has right this play.
[1:28:55] He knows what will happen next. What
[1:29:00] will happen?
[1:29:03] But the players
[1:29:05] don't know. Oh, we thank God this
[1:29:07] morning. When God planned,
[1:29:11] we were part of the plan.
[1:29:14] That is why we know every move. We know
[1:29:18] how this world. We know how this world
[1:29:22] will come to an end. We know how this
[1:29:25] plague will come to an end because we
[1:29:29] were with him. We can tell them what has
[1:29:33] happened before the foundation of the
[1:29:36] world. what has happened in the garden
[1:29:39] of Eden and the world do not know but
[1:29:43] brother Brham stood behind the pool and
[1:29:47] tell them there was a serpent there and
[1:29:51] the scientists of the world they don't
[1:29:53] know
[1:29:56] amen now God put Russia there
[1:30:01] put UK there put Europe there
[1:30:04] put America there put Africa there and
[1:30:07] he look at the entire globe and look at
[1:30:11] the plague
[1:30:13] he wrote because God is a good planner.
[1:30:18] Listen to this. He started everything
[1:30:22] there in the Middle East.
[1:30:24] He started this church ages with Paul
[1:30:28] the apostle. He started preaching there
[1:30:32] and the other apostle.
[1:30:34] Then that thing in the Middle East come
[1:30:37] to an end. Is it the end of the word of
[1:30:39] God?
[1:30:41] No. He left Middle East
[1:30:45] and went to Germany.
[1:30:48] Do you know that? Amen.
[1:30:49] When he get to Germany, he found Martin
[1:30:52] Lu. The word of God fell in the heart of
[1:30:57] Martin Luther in Europe.
[1:31:00] Germany when he speak the entire world
[1:31:04] She listen.
[1:31:08] When Martin Luther's time come to an
[1:31:11] end, was it the end of God?
[1:31:14] No. God said, "Europe, it's okay. Let me
[1:31:19] go and continue with my play." He went
[1:31:22] to England, United Kingdom,
[1:31:26] right in the heart of John Wesley. Then
[1:31:29] when Wesley speak, the entire world
[1:31:34] We listen. It was God in moving from
[1:31:38] Middle East
[1:31:40] to Germany, from Germany to England.
[1:31:44] From England, he flyed to America.
[1:31:49] When he get to America, he found the man
[1:31:53] by the name of brother Brenham and he
[1:31:55] became his prophet. Then when brother
[1:31:58] Brenham talk, the entire world must
[1:32:02] listen.
[1:32:03] He is the prophet of God. And he said to
[1:32:06] the world, I preach like Paul. Paul is
[1:32:09] the prophet of the first church age. He
[1:32:13] is the prophet of the last church age.
[1:32:18] And brother Brham says is the end of
[1:32:20] everything because the seventh seal was
[1:32:24] open. When brother Brham come to an end,
[1:32:29] is God looking at the plague? when he's
[1:32:32] looking at this play continentally.
[1:32:41] Then brother Brenham come to an end. He
[1:32:44] said now when the Laudian church age
[1:32:48] when the entire church ages
[1:32:51] come to an end the message must go back
[1:32:56] to Israel where things started they will
[1:32:59] end there. Then God said yes. But
[1:33:02] there's one continent that I learn is
[1:33:05] Africa.
[1:33:08] Amen.
[1:33:08] Amen.
[1:33:09] Amen.
[1:33:09] God cannot complete this journey of the
[1:33:14] continent without Africa.
[1:33:20] the continent that the inhabitants
[1:33:24] belittle themselves not knowing how
[1:33:27] powerful they are.
[1:33:32] Africa is the only continent
[1:33:36] in the world that sustain the entire
[1:33:40] world.
[1:33:42] I'm saying the only content
[1:33:46] some of many of the minerals you cannot
[1:33:50] find in Russia but Russia is the largest
[1:33:54] continent you can find them in America
[1:33:58] but America is the super power country
[1:34:01] you can't find them in Europe Africa is
[1:34:05] the only country that has everything
[1:34:09] then brother Benham come to Africa
[1:34:12] Because God was in he and when he come
[1:34:14] to Africa, he come to South Africa and
[1:34:18] that means South Africa. Because brother
[1:34:20] Brenham was here preaching to the people
[1:34:24] South Africa tell the world.
[1:34:27] Amen.
[1:34:28] Speak to the world.
[1:34:31] Amen. Amen. When this message come to
[1:34:34] South Africa, it find our pastor. I will
[1:34:38] never stop saying that.
[1:34:40] I will never stop saying that. If one
[1:34:44] criticize me for saying that I'm here
[1:34:46] challenge me because the ministry of the
[1:34:50] seven seal it came to our pastor no
[1:34:54] other man can say them. The reason why
[1:34:58] brother came to Africa
[1:35:00] knew that when this message is here in
[1:35:04] the right heart will go to the entire
[1:35:07] world.
[1:35:09] I want to tell you this morning this is
[1:35:12] the revival of Africa after this. The
[1:35:16] message is not going to any other
[1:35:19] country
[1:35:21] back to the Middle East.
[1:35:24] [Applause]
[1:35:26] Right there in the Middle East where
[1:35:28] things started ended.
[1:35:32] I remember brother Brenham the other day
[1:35:35] he was preaching and here comes a prayer
[1:35:38] line.
[1:35:39] When the parent come look at the child
[1:35:43] was a black child was an African child.
[1:35:46] Brother prayed and said Lord
[1:35:49] this child is innocent.
[1:35:52] When I look at him I remember his great
[1:35:57] great great great grandfather
[1:36:00] who carried the cross of our Lord Jesus
[1:36:04] Christ.
[1:36:05] Lord God, you are obliged.
[1:36:09] healed this child because of his great
[1:36:12] great great father who carried the cross
[1:36:14] of
[1:36:19] brother Brennham came to Africa and
[1:36:22] South Africa let me tell you the thing
[1:36:25] you didn't know here in Ptoria as they
[1:36:29] were driving him
[1:36:31] one of the white farmers or bulk of that
[1:36:35] time
[1:36:38] almost hit a person, a black person with
[1:36:41] a gun. Brother Brenham said, "Stop,
[1:36:44] stop, stop. It's a human being." And
[1:36:47] that man said, "No, it's not a human
[1:36:49] being." Brother Brenham said to him, "Do
[1:36:52] you know whom you are talking to?"
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:36:59] Amen.
[1:37:01] He said always
[1:37:04] brother Benham he came here and the the
[1:37:07] the the the previous regime
[1:37:11] rejected he when they rejected him he
[1:37:16] went back but he was always saying
[1:37:19] Africa.
[1:37:22] Amen.
[1:37:23] Amen. He knew very well because he said
[1:37:26] to that white man, these people
[1:37:30] souls and the day they catch it,
[1:37:34] they will go with it. Let me tell you
[1:37:37] this morning, he was talking to us. He
[1:37:41] was referring to us. We caught what
[1:37:45] America do not have.
[1:37:52] I don't know the surname of that man was
[1:37:56] or what
[1:37:58] he was interpreting
[1:38:01] in Africans
[1:38:03] when brother Brenham was preaching in
[1:38:05] English and brother Brenham doesn't know
[1:38:08] African but the Holy Ghost said to
[1:38:10] brother Brenam tell this man he's not
[1:38:13] interpreting
[1:38:15] [Applause]
[1:38:18] brotherham turn around to his
[1:38:21] interpreter. He said, "I interpret what
[1:38:23] I'm saying. Do not interpret what I'm
[1:38:25] saying. Because this man has realized
[1:38:29] that I can't stand for this. It was not
[1:38:32] for him. It was for us. When brother
[1:38:36] Brham come to Africa, he came for us
[1:38:39] brother.
[1:38:41] [Applause]
[1:38:46] world
[1:38:47] for them to survive.
[1:38:49] They better listen to Africa,
[1:38:54] not just Africa,
[1:38:56] South Africa,
[1:38:58] not just South Africa. Mommy, Lord,
[1:39:01] Lord,
[1:39:04] because God has put that in our heart.
[1:39:09] When everything come to an end from this
[1:39:12] church, it goes back to Israel.
[1:39:20] You can go and tell them after service
[1:39:22] is not a problem
[1:39:25] brothers out there preaching this word
[1:39:28] of God they got it from here
[1:39:31] [Applause]
[1:39:35] more than 80% of the pastors
[1:39:38] 80% if they are not ordained from here
[1:39:42] but they got the message from
[1:39:45] Challenge me. I will give you the
[1:39:47] answers.
[1:39:53] This was a play
[1:39:56] that God wrote.
[1:39:59] He said Russia
[1:40:01] everything will be finished by you just
[1:40:04] stay there. Brother says Russia
[1:40:08] is the tool in the hand of God. Then he
[1:40:12] said, "Israel, you are my nation. I
[1:40:15] start here. I will end everything here.
[1:40:18] But let me just go to Germany. Go to
[1:40:22] Britain.
[1:40:23] Go to America. Come to Africa. Then I
[1:40:26] will go back to
[1:40:32] Amen.
[1:40:32] Amen.
[1:40:34] I was listening to um
[1:40:39] who's that lumumba professor
[1:40:43] I was listening to him then he said
[1:40:46] Africa
[1:40:47] Africa
[1:40:48] are the international beggars
[1:40:53] he said wake up you have everything
[1:40:56] if naturally
[1:40:58] they fail let's not fail spiritually
[1:41:07] Now what I have
[1:41:09] no one can challenge me coming from
[1:41:13] America coming from Europe coming from
[1:41:16] Russia what God has put in my heart I
[1:41:21] will stand for it
[1:41:23] [Applause]
[1:41:25] that is why I don't fight for diamond
[1:41:29] for gold,
[1:41:31] titanium,
[1:41:32] titanium
[1:41:33] or platinum platinum.
[1:41:35] No, no. Is the natural resources
[1:41:39] that God has made me a supernatural
[1:41:44] being so I will have a supernatural
[1:41:49] ingredients for the resources.
[1:41:55] Don't be scared.
[1:41:57] No.
[1:41:59] You are so special.
[1:42:01] The world is on hold
[1:42:05] because of you. God has put this
[1:42:07] ministry
[1:42:09] in us. The moment we baptize the last
[1:42:14] sheep,
[1:42:16] message go back to Israel.
[1:42:20] We will be raptured.
[1:42:22] And it's true because brother Brandham
[1:42:25] says we are no longer In the church age,
[1:42:30] we are in the bright age. We are sealed.
[1:42:35] We are untouchable.
[1:42:37] The one that used to report us
[1:42:40] before God, he can't. We are sealed.
[1:42:45] [Applause]
[1:42:49] [Music]
[1:42:52] Don't be scared.
[1:42:55] Don't
[1:42:57] Amen.
[1:42:58] Amen.
[1:43:02] This is a time for Africa.
[1:43:06] Wake up.
[1:43:07] You have what America does not have.
[1:43:14] I've heard I've seen in Brenham
[1:43:19] they don't preach.
[1:43:24] Here we preach because
[1:43:29] that's what brother said
[1:43:31] the Joshua
[1:43:33] will lead you through. That's why we
[1:43:36] have Joshua to lead us through.
[1:43:42] We preach the present
[1:43:46] and the future.
[1:43:54] Notice
[1:43:56] they they they are right now uniting.
[1:44:01] You see brother is that true?
[1:44:06] Yes. They are coming to the battle of
[1:44:09] Emagedo.
[1:44:11] Exactly what they will do.
[1:44:16] They are uniting for that right now.
[1:44:20] That's why we got United Nation
[1:44:25] and everything we have. the world I mean
[1:44:30] the western world
[1:44:32] uniting
[1:44:34] against the eastern world the communism
[1:44:39] and so forth it's all uniting together
[1:44:44] the churches are uniting
[1:44:48] everything seems to be uniting
[1:44:50] uniting themselves together we see that
[1:44:55] if the world is uniting
[1:44:59] the west and the east. What about the
[1:45:02] bride?
[1:45:03] God is uniting the bride.
[1:45:07] She is coming together
[1:45:10] from the east and the west and the north
[1:45:13] and the south. There is uniting tie
[1:45:17] and that's on right now.
[1:45:20] What is she uniting for? For the
[1:45:24] rapture.
[1:45:28] God getting her ready.
[1:45:31] Yes sir. Amen.
[1:45:32] Uniting. What is she uniting with? With
[1:45:36] the word. For all heavens and earth will
[1:45:40] pass away. But my word shall never pass
[1:45:44] away because we are the way. In the
[1:45:48] beginning there was a way. The word was
[1:45:52] with God. The word was God. The word
[1:45:56] made flesh. We are the flesh today.
[1:46:00] We are the word today because the way
[1:46:04] bring forth the way. God bring forth am
[1:46:08] God who you are today.
[1:46:12] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:13] She's uniting herself with that says the
[1:46:16] Lord. Regardless
[1:46:19] what any denomination,
[1:46:22] anybody else,
[1:46:24] she is uniting herself.
[1:46:27] She's getting ready.
[1:46:29] Why? She is a bride.
[1:46:34] If the world is uniting,
[1:46:38] we are uniting.
[1:46:42] Our uniting is on a spiritual level. is
[1:46:46] not on the natural level. On the natural
[1:46:48] level is chaos.
[1:46:52] Someone can love you today and hate you
[1:46:56] tomorrow. That's on the natural level.
[1:46:59] But on the spiritual level, first love
[1:47:04] from eternity today.
[1:47:09] Can I just be honest with you this
[1:47:10] morning?
[1:47:12] Amen.
[1:47:13] Amen. Life is about war.
[1:47:18] Revelation 12 said there was a war in
[1:47:21] heaven.
[1:47:23] If there was a war in heaven, who are we
[1:47:25] here on earth?
[1:47:31] And brother says, the war that was in
[1:47:34] heaven will be finished here
[1:47:38] and everything will come to an end. And
[1:47:41] the war of Armageddon
[1:47:43] And do not be scared to be hated
[1:47:47] by people.
[1:47:50] Do not be scared
[1:47:53] if they love you. What are they going to
[1:47:55] give? I have this angle of mind. He has
[1:47:59] money. He buy beer for our ny cousin and
[1:48:06] even if he talk rubbish.
[1:48:08] [Music]
[1:48:13] Amen.
[1:48:19] He has a bottle of Jack Daniels in the
[1:48:21] boot.
[1:48:27] He's going to give them.
[1:48:28] They love him. But now the man is
[1:48:31] finished.
[1:48:35] He has headache all day long.
[1:48:37] Where are those people? They didn't love
[1:48:39] him. They wanted what he had.
[1:48:45] The love of God is unconditional.
[1:48:50] If there was a war in heaven, there will
[1:48:53] be war here on earth. For our Lord Jesus
[1:48:56] Christ said, I did not come with peace.
[1:49:02] I come with war.
[1:49:05] The in-laws
[1:49:06] in
[1:49:07] will fight.
[1:49:09] Husband and wife will fight.
[1:49:12] Siblings will fight. Colleagues will
[1:49:15] fight. Church members will poison one
[1:49:18] another
[1:49:20] for the positions.
[1:49:25] Thank you because you are quiet.
[1:49:27] [Music]
[1:49:30] But you are fighting because here on
[1:49:33] earth is the place of fight.
[1:49:37] You disagree with me, I
[1:49:41] disagree with you, you fight because we
[1:49:45] are at war. The world is at war.
[1:49:55] Don't live a compromised life.
[1:50:00] God has made us special.
[1:50:04] God has made us unique.
[1:50:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:09] But life is about fighting.
[1:50:14] And the English saying we disagree to
[1:50:17] agree and agree to disagree.
[1:50:21] But God is building his pride.
[1:50:25] He's building his bride. One of the days
[1:50:29] we are gone. Let's read. Amen.
[1:50:33] Now here they are joining themselves
[1:50:35] together.
[1:50:38] When I read here he say they are joining
[1:50:41] themselves together.
[1:50:43] Even us we are joining ourselves
[1:50:46] together.
[1:50:48] coming to that showdown
[1:50:50] in Armageddon and riding on a mixed
[1:50:53] colored horse
[1:50:55] [Music]
[1:50:57] with one horse
[1:50:59] of white, one horse of red, one horse of
[1:51:04] black. The different political power,
[1:51:10] spiritual power
[1:51:12] controlled by the demon power
[1:51:15] which is antichrist.
[1:51:18] Mixing that all together,
[1:51:20] he got pale.
[1:51:23] Sickly looking thing he's riding on.
[1:51:27] That's right. Now notice. Look what he's
[1:51:31] riding on.
[1:51:33] This pale looking
[1:51:36] colored walls mixed with black.
[1:51:40] red, white, coming into battle,
[1:51:44] gathering his subject
[1:51:47] from every nation under heaven.
[1:51:50] The world we are living in
[1:51:53] is is something that God want, the devil
[1:51:59] want.
[1:52:02] Now at the end one will show if he's on
[1:52:06] this side or the other side. You know
[1:52:10] why there when there was a war in heaven
[1:52:13] one showed if he's that side this side
[1:52:18] this morning we will show ourselves
[1:52:21] whether we were on the side of Michael
[1:52:25] or on the side Lucifer
[1:52:29] something that you cannot hide.
[1:52:33] Amen.
[1:52:34] You know Pharaoh, he went several time
[1:52:37] to Moses.
[1:52:39] Moses pray for me.
[1:52:42] I don't want all these plagues.
[1:52:46] Moses even if you can pray and feel for
[1:52:49] him because they grew up together didn't
[1:52:52] help him. God said, "I God." You see,
[1:52:57] you hear that? I God hardened
[1:53:01] the heart of Pharaoh. Who are you? Is
[1:53:04] your prayer going to work?
[1:53:07] No. Your prayer is not going to work
[1:53:10] because God did that.
[1:53:13] I God
[1:53:15] hardened the heart of Hitler.
[1:53:19] Are you going to let Hitler to repent?
[1:53:24] I God hardened the heart of
[1:53:29] Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:53:30] Are you going to make him repent? The
[1:53:33] Iranian caught Israel from Babylon. Then
[1:53:38] Babylon
[1:53:39] was shattered.
[1:53:41] Then Iran took over. The Israelites were
[1:53:45] inside there.
[1:53:47] Amen.
[1:53:47] Amen. One of the kings
[1:53:50] used the utensils from the you know the
[1:53:53] church of God the temple of God then God
[1:53:57] strike him. Even if even if you pray for
[1:54:01] that individual
[1:54:03] you will not save
[1:54:06] what what am I trying to tell you? If
[1:54:10] you pray for someone to get healed to be
[1:54:15] out of his problem, it was God directing
[1:54:20] you to do things.
[1:54:24] If God didn't want them, it will never
[1:54:27] happen. That is why you don't go around
[1:54:31] telling the people how proud you are.
[1:54:35] You can pray for the sick.
[1:54:38] You can't. It's God. using you.
[1:54:43] God used
[1:54:46] to punish Israel. God used Russia to
[1:54:50] punish Israel
[1:54:53] is at the right time
[1:54:56] raise
[1:54:57] and say you cannot touch my nation and I
[1:55:02] leave you alone. You cannot touch the
[1:55:05] anointed one and I will leave you alone.
[1:55:09] What am I trying to tell you
[1:55:11] brothers and sisters?
[1:55:14] This mind or the thought of God was in
[1:55:18] him and he completed it. After completed
[1:55:22] it, he opened and roll it all. When he
[1:55:27] is rolling them on, there's nothing that
[1:55:31] can be edited.
[1:55:36] It was a complete job. Today we are part
[1:55:41] of God.
[1:55:45] He thought about us. We are here because
[1:55:49] we are the thought of God
[1:55:52] express.
[1:55:54] We are his attribute.
[1:55:57] He chose us to be the last
[1:56:01] to finish this course.
[1:56:04] Amen.
[1:56:04] Amen.
[1:56:05] That is why Our continent
[1:56:08] is so blessed.
[1:56:12] We know what the world doesn't know. We
[1:56:16] have what the world doesn't have because
[1:56:21] God chose us to be like them.
[1:56:24] Even if they mock you that you think
[1:56:27] like you're short hair,
[1:56:30] they don't know.
[1:56:38] I'm not scared.
[1:56:41] Amen.
[1:56:42] Amen.
[1:56:42] Because I know myself.
[1:56:47] One of the white guy said to me,
[1:56:52] "You you it seems like you are rich.
[1:56:56] There are more than that way.
[1:56:59] But in my bank
[1:57:01] is overdraft.
[1:57:06] My father,
[1:57:08] God is rich. Everything belongs to him.
[1:57:14] Then he started to look at me and
[1:57:16] started to hate me. And I said to him of
[1:57:20] what I have. I just took from the
[1:57:22] millions I have.
[1:57:25] Why are you working? I work because I
[1:57:28] need to work. Just pushing time. Soon
[1:57:32] I'll be going to glory.
[1:57:35] [Applause]
[1:57:37] Brothers and sisters, you are rich.
[1:57:41] God who rich in mercy is your father.
[1:57:46] One of the days, God said to his
[1:57:48] disciple, if these people are looking
[1:57:51] for test, go to the river, the first
[1:57:55] fish you catch, open it is money, give
[1:57:59] it to them. He's rich, but he doesn't go
[1:58:03] all over the place. He create money.
[1:58:06] Brother Brenham saw the well of oil. And
[1:58:10] if he could identify that and tell it to
[1:58:14] the people was supposed to be the wealth
[1:58:16] for his entire life and his generation.
[1:58:20] But brother Brennham said or God said to
[1:58:23] him if you get that activate it
[1:58:28] you will mess up in the word of God.
[1:58:34] There are certain things that God does
[1:58:37] not expose
[1:58:39] to us
[1:58:42] to save us. we can be exposed.
[1:58:48] We won't be here this morning
[1:58:53] because another
[1:58:55] German lady while I was working with her
[1:58:59] then she found me praying for food.
[1:59:03] Then when I say amen, she said to me,
[1:59:06] why are you praying for food? You know,
[1:59:08] to thank God. Thank God for what?
[1:59:13] But he gave me food. He gave me work. He
[1:59:16] said, "No, you work for that food. Just
[1:59:19] open and eat."
[1:59:26] Brother Brenham
[1:59:28] thought he knows better. But one day God
[1:59:33] showed him that you are my prophet, but
[1:59:36] you know nothing.
[1:59:40] He wanted to go home while the snow was
[1:59:43] coming.
[1:59:44] He was in the wood.
[1:59:46] So he run and run. When he was running
[1:59:50] and breathing heavily, thinking approach
[1:59:53] home, he was where he was.
[1:59:58] He tried again and he was where he was.
[2:00:01] Then God said to him, "I am the one
[2:00:05] who's given direction in your life. You
[2:00:08] better listen to me." Brother Brennan
[2:00:12] thought he knows how to fish. But one of
[2:00:17] one of the days he couldn't catch. He
[2:00:20] was surprised. And God comes to him. He
[2:00:23] said, "I teach you how to catch. I
[2:00:27] direct the fish to your line."
[2:00:31] Amen. Amen.
[2:00:32] Then God said to him, "Throw the L." He
[2:00:37] catch the small. He catch the medium. He
[2:00:40] said to him, "Throw deeper." When he
[2:00:43] throw deeper, go direct big fish. He
[2:00:47] catch the big fish. After catching the
[2:00:49] big fish, he said that is the third
[2:00:52] pool. What is the third pool? Is the
[2:00:56] seventh seal. The seven seal is when God
[2:01:01] leave the ivory of heaven
[2:01:04] come down to kept the seven church
[2:01:08] and the dead field. We are just here
[2:01:13] playing this game
[2:01:16] of of being here in Africa in South
[2:01:20] Africa in Lord when he's completed it
[2:01:25] goes back to Israel where things have
[2:01:28] started and that is the end of the
[2:01:30] world.
[2:01:32] The war of Armageddon
[2:01:35] is when Russia said to America,
[2:01:41] holy God,
[2:01:41] it is enough.
[2:01:42] Amen.
[2:01:43] Amen.
[2:01:44] Now is the time and the time. It's now
[2:01:49] Brennham says here, it depends who threw
[2:01:53] the first one.
[2:01:57] Amen. Amen. When this one through that
[2:02:01] one through,
[2:02:02] remember Israel,
[2:02:05] Germany, Germany,
[2:02:06] UK, UK,
[2:02:07] France, America, Russia, you name them,
[2:02:11] they all have this atomic nuclear.
[2:02:23] Yes. Let me show them. Then they show
[2:02:26] each other. When they show each other,
[2:02:29] it was the end of everything.
[2:02:32] No one is going to survive. There's no
[2:02:35] survivor.
[2:02:36] In the war of Armageddon, the third
[2:02:39] world war, there's no survivor. All the
[2:02:42] missiles. They will be shooting all over
[2:02:45] the world. There will be chaos. People
[2:02:47] will be dying. The the very responsible
[2:02:51] people that made the shooting will die.
[2:02:57] You remember the soldiers
[2:03:00] that put Shhatrach
[2:03:04] in the furnace?
[2:03:06] They died.
[2:03:10] But Shadrach, Michigan.
[2:03:13] They didn't die. God preserved them.
[2:03:17] Amen. Amen. When the world bring this
[2:03:21] fire, everyone having all those things
[2:03:25] will die. But the bride will be
[2:03:28] somewhere
[2:03:30] in a safe chamber.
[2:03:33] From there, that's when you will go.
[2:03:37] Amen. Amen.
[2:03:39] The message for another day, we will
[2:03:42] look at the millennium.
[2:03:46] What is millennia?
[2:03:48] There is another Gog and Moro
[2:03:52] that is coming and the white throne
[2:03:54] judgment
[2:03:56] the new city the eternal one that's
[2:04:00] where we are going that's what those are
[2:04:02] the things
[2:04:04] that are within time
[2:04:07] then after death it's beyond time when
[2:04:10] it's beyond time eternity that's where
[2:04:14] we are going make sure
[2:04:17] I want I don't want to say make sure
[2:04:20] because even if you can make sure you
[2:04:22] might never make it. I'm saying let God
[2:04:27] do his will. If you are in the rapture
[2:04:30] we go. If you are not in the rapture
[2:04:33] even if amen. Amen.
[2:04:36] Let me just say it.
[2:04:40] Don't say this after service.
[2:04:44] This message was powerful.
[2:04:46] I'm going to be serious now.
[2:04:49] Don't try that. You'll be hurting
[2:04:52] yourself.
[2:04:54] A complete job was done.
[2:04:57] You are serious or not serious. It
[2:05:01] doesn't matter. What matters
[2:05:04] that's who you were.
[2:05:08] Don't try to say
[2:05:10] don't even test me.
[2:05:13] I should pray for you. My prayer is not
[2:05:14] going to help you to for you to be in
[2:05:17] the rapture. No, this is a play that God
[2:05:22] wrote. Put it into action
[2:05:26] part of it. You took the side of Michael
[2:05:30] even today. You will take the side of
[2:05:33] there's nothing that can stop you. You
[2:05:35] don't need a prayer here. You don't need
[2:05:37] to fast there.
[2:05:39] Just play this play
[2:05:43] put you in. God bless you.
[2:05:48] Amen.
[2:05:49] Amen.
[2:05:51] Amen.
[2:05:52] Amen.
[2:05:53] Let's sing unto the Lord.
[2:05:56] Amen.
[2:05:57] Amen.
[2:05:58] I hope we are getting somewhere.
[2:06:01] Little by little, day by day, we are
[2:06:05] getting there. Just relax in the word of
[2:06:07] God.
[2:06:10] Let God
[2:06:12] incarnated himself in you.
[2:06:16] Amen. Amen. Do his job. He He He carried
[2:06:20] us. Now we carried He
[2:06:25] is the greatest achievement that God
[2:06:26] wanted
[2:06:28] achievement

[2:12:08] in a land that you will never

[2:12:14] Blessed Lord heavenly father,
[2:12:17] thank you again this afternoon
[2:12:20] for speaking to your children.
[2:12:24] Lord
[2:12:25] because you've given us promises.
[2:12:29] You've given us your word and this word
[2:12:33] is full of divine promises.
[2:12:36] You've promised us a land.
[2:12:39] We feel so blessed, my God, that even
[2:12:43] when there's this chaos going around us,
[2:12:47] we have a promise.
[2:12:53] Every time
[2:12:56] I see elderly people,
[2:12:59] every time I see their hair turning gray
[2:13:05] and their face getting wrinkled,
[2:13:09] it gives me so much joy
[2:13:12] because your weight,
[2:13:15] your power is about to be manifested.
[2:13:20] It gives me so much joy
[2:13:23] just to know that one of these days
[2:13:26] they will be young again.
[2:13:29] [Applause]
[2:13:32] It makes me love them. It makes my heart
[2:13:37] rejoice
[2:13:39] because it is closer.
[2:13:43] It's nearer for your word to be
[2:13:46] manifested again.
[2:13:48] Thank you Lord for your word. Thank you
[2:13:51] for speaking unto us again
[2:13:55] this day. Oh God,
[2:14:09] we have a promise. You promise us the
[2:14:13] rapture.
[2:14:15] One of these days
[2:14:17] we will be going home.
[2:14:20] Lord, we can feel
[2:14:23] we can feel that the move is on
[2:14:27] the dimensions. We can feel oh God that
[2:14:31] we are bumping against the dimensions
[2:14:35] are bumping against each other.
[2:14:38] One of these days
[2:14:42] we will move out of this place.
[2:14:53] Predestination.
[2:14:59] Before the beginning when you said let
[2:15:02] us,
[2:15:04] you were talking about us.
[2:15:07] We thank you for that predestination.
[2:15:10] The brother says, "Don't come. There's
[2:15:13] nothing I can do for you. It is in the
[2:15:16] plan of God. It is just in this play.
[2:15:21] But Lord,
[2:15:24] I am in that play. You thought of me and
[2:15:29] you made me to be a part of that play. I
[2:15:34] don't know why. I just want to give all
[2:15:36] honor and glory unto you.
[2:15:46] May you be with them, oh God. May you
[2:15:49] strengthen them, heavenly father. May
[2:15:52] you bless them, oh God.
[2:15:57] They must just look forward to that
[2:16:00] morning, oh God, when they will go out
[2:16:03] of this body.
[2:16:12] [Music]
[2:16:29] We are what we are because of him.
[2:16:34] We are what we are
[2:16:38] because he came and he stood behind this
[2:16:41] pulpit.

[2:23:29] Let let me ask
[2:23:32] just to come and pray for us and then
[2:23:35] after that we'll continue
[2:23:38] uh with our brother reading the word of
[2:23:40] God then we'll proceed with the baptism.
[2:23:43] Amen.
[2:23:45] Can we bow our heads? Dear heavenly
[2:23:48] father once again we raise our hearts,
[2:23:51] our souls, our spirits unto thee.
[2:23:54] Thanking you Lord for the word. Here we
[2:23:56] are standing before the trophies of this
[2:23:59] great ministry of the opening
[2:24:03] of your original spoken word. The whole
[2:24:07] Bible Lord has entered in their hearts
[2:24:10] being God himself restoring them back.
[2:24:12] Father they've heard your word. You have
[2:24:16] said Lord if a person hear your word
[2:24:20] repent and be baptized in your name. He
[2:24:25] has passed from dead to life
[2:24:28] today. It's a symbol of their burial
[2:24:31] Lord of the old man
[2:24:34] walking in the newness of the word of
[2:24:36] God
[2:24:37] to be born by God himself
[2:24:40] with his incorruptible word
[2:24:43] incorruptable seed.
[2:24:45] Father, they've heard your word since
[2:24:47] from the beginning.
[2:24:49] You said you chose them and wrote their
[2:24:51] names. They've heard you, Lord. You gave
[2:24:54] them the the revelation that they need,
[2:24:57] Father. So as they are entering in, we
[2:25:01] are saying to Satan, they are no longer
[2:25:03] your property.
[2:25:04] They are God's property.
[2:25:06] You touch them, you touch God.
[2:25:09] So we thank you, Father, for the giant
[2:25:12] church step that they've taken to repent
[2:25:14] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:25:16] Jesus Christ. And Lord, you said you
[2:25:19] shall enter into them. We ask all these
[2:25:22] blessings as the brothers are taking
[2:25:24] them inside as it was one day Jesus went
[2:25:27] to John to be baptized and the dove came
[2:25:31] down. Your spirit Lord came to Jesus
[2:25:35] because he knew that he was going to be
[2:25:37] a sacrifice. One day you died and buried
[2:25:40] and rose again. Father as they entering
[2:25:43] in we know that they will rise again and
[2:25:46] walk in your newness. Father,
[2:25:48] we commit everything in the mighty name
[2:25:51] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[2:25:53] Amen.
[2:25:55] [Applause]
[2:26:01] We read the book of Acts chapter 2 from
[2:26:04] verse 36-39.
[2:26:07] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[2:26:09] know assuredly that God hath made that
[2:26:12] same Jesus whom he have crucified both
[2:26:15] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[2:26:18] this, they were priced in their heart
[2:26:20] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[2:26:22] the apostles, "Men and brethren, what
[2:26:25] shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them,
[2:26:28] "Repent, and be baptized, every one of
[2:26:30] you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[2:26:33] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[2:26:35] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[2:26:38] the promise is unto you and to your
[2:26:40] children, and to all that are a far off,
[2:26:43] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[2:26:46] call.
