[49:45] Then after
[49:47] that Then I will ask you to
[49:54] stand marriage.
[49:58] Originally it was for
[50:04] parents. It belonged to
[50:10] parents just like in the
[50:14] beginning. called the
[50:17] father who was the father of Adam.
[50:22] He
[50:23] said, "My son, now it's not good for my
[50:27] son to be alone."
[50:29] [Music]
[50:32] It was not Adam who said, "I need
[50:37] somebody." that it was his
[50:40] father
[50:42] God who said it was not good for my
[50:45] [Music]
[50:47] son to be alone.
[50:51] Then God the father
[50:54] the father of
[50:57] Abraham he led Adam to a deep
[51:04] sleep. Then when slept
[51:08] He took one rib of Adam
[51:13] and made for
[51:15] Adam
[51:20] helpmate from Adam's
[51:24] sleep. After he had made
[51:29] her, he didn't breathe the breath of
[51:32] life into her.
[51:37] But after he had formed
[51:41] Adam in that
[51:44] formation, he bre the breath of
[51:48] life. Then Adam became a living soul.
[51:53] But after he had created this
[51:57] one, we don't hear the Bible saying he
[52:00] bre the breath of life into
[52:05] her
[52:07] because he took that part of
[52:13] Adam, a spiritual part of
[52:16] Adam and place it into this
[52:22] Then he took this
[52:23] one and brought her to
[52:28] Adam. And Adam said,
[52:31] "This is the bone of my
[52:34] bone and the flesh of my
[52:37] flesh." It was the father of
[52:41] Adam who looked for Adam's wife.
[52:48] Even
[52:49] Abraham because Abraham had the spirit
[52:52] of God,
[52:55] he knew that for her son to have a
[53:02] wife, he had to go and look for the
[53:08] wife for his
[53:11] son. Then he looked around around his
[53:15] servants
[53:18] And he called for the the trust with his
[53:26] servant. And he called that
[53:30] one. He was the one who was over all the
[53:36] servants. And he said to this
[53:38] one, he said, "Go and look for my son.
[53:44] go and look for the wife of my
[53:47] son. I trusted this
[53:50] one but this one will go and bring the
[53:54] right wife of my
[53:58] son. What I am saying I say originally
[54:02] marriage belong to the parent.
[54:08] You know when we buy
[54:11] cars, we buy them as they
[54:15] are perhap from Nissan or Toyota or
[54:21] whatever. But when you have brought
[54:24] it, you can try to modify
[54:28] it. When you modify it, it will be look
[54:32] better than the first one.
[54:36] But if you take it to the
[54:39] garage together with this one which
[54:43] which is not
[54:45] motivated, the the motif one will be
[54:48] lesser in
[54:53] price than the one who is not
[54:56] [Music]
[54:58] motif. The mar the marriages we have
[55:02] nowadays they are the modified
[55:06] [Music]
[55:07] marriages. They are not the original
[55:11] ones. That's why if it if it was the
[55:17] because now is
[55:19] the the young man who looks for the
[55:22] wife.
[55:26] No more the father who looks for
[55:31] the it was modified
[55:34] now. But when it was still in its
[55:37] original
[55:40] form, it was the father.
[55:44] The Bible here where I've
[55:47] read he said let us be glad and
[55:55] rejoice and give honor to
[55:59] him for the marriage of the lamb is
[56:03] come and his wife had make herself
[56:09] ready. Why this wife has made herself
[56:12] ready?
[56:15] Before the wife can make herself
[56:20] ready, he had to make herself ready with
[56:23] the voice of the
[56:27] husband. That's why in our
[56:30] age, the prophet said the word of God
[56:33] now is in the
[56:38] bride knows how to do with the
[56:42] weight. The bride knows how to act
[56:45] according to the
[56:48] weight. The bride can prepare herself
[56:51] according to the
[56:52] [Music]
[56:54] weight because the bride now is
[56:59] married because the Bible says h those
[57:02] who are invited to the merit supper of
[57:06] the lamb
[57:08] [Music]
[57:14] They are
[57:16] blessed. They say the merry
[57:20] supper. Merry
[57:23] [Music]
[57:24] supper. Supper is at night.
[57:29] Supper will be after the
[57:34] marriage because the bride is now
[57:37] already
[57:40] married. He has to go to the merry
[57:45] supper where they are going to sit
[57:47] around the table and join
[57:51] themselves. Before they they can get
[57:55] there, they must have received the word
[57:59] of the husband
[58:03] here. When they have received the word
[58:05] of the
[58:08] husband, they had to be married by that
[58:11] husband.
[58:14] The father
[58:16] God is the one who looked for his son's
[58:24] wife. That's why his son was
[58:29] born. In fact, it was he
[58:33] himself. He came in a form of a
[58:38] son. So that this
[58:40] son must have a wife.
[58:44] For the son to have a
[58:46] wife, his his father had to come in
[58:51] flesh to look for the son's
[58:56] wife. That's why when Abraham was
[58:58] looking for his son's
[59:01] wife, he said, "The angel of the Lord
[59:04] will lead
[59:06] you." Because this is now a modified
[59:09] marriage.
[59:14] for a few
[59:16] minutes. I'm going to talk like a
[59:18] marriage
[59:23] counselor because the marriage marriage
[59:26] counselors and social
[59:29] workers came because of this motif
[59:35] marriages. Because
[59:37] originally we don't need a social work.
[59:41] We don't need a marriage counselor.
[59:45] But they've come because of this motif
[59:47] [Music]
[59:49] marriages. That's why I say now I'm not
[59:51] going to talk like a
[59:56] pastor. I'm going to talk like a
[59:58] marriage counselor. Marriage not
[1:00:00] marriage counselor but marriage officer.
[1:00:06] I want to be a
[1:00:08] marriage counselor for a short time.
[1:00:15] Marriage is a timeless
[1:00:18] [Music]
[1:00:21] institution. It is a beautiful journey
[1:00:24] of two
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:28] lives woven together by the thread of
[1:00:31] the word of God.
[1:00:38] is a
[1:00:39] journey filled with moments that are
[1:00:43] sometimes
[1:00:47] [Music]
[1:00:49] difficult and sometimes
[1:00:52] easy is a
[1:00:54] journey where love is a compass.
[1:01:03] Let me
[1:01:04] repeat. Is a
[1:01:07] J where love is a
[1:01:14] compass and understanding is the
[1:01:19] map and trust is the guiding star.
[1:01:22] [Music]
[1:01:25] You must not forget I said I'm not
[1:01:27] talking like a pastor now.
[1:01:31] I'm talking like a marriage
[1:01:36] counselor. It is a it is a commitment
[1:01:40] between two
[1:01:44] people who promise to stand by each
[1:01:49] [Music]
[1:01:51] other through this live
[1:01:55] journey. I am not talking to the two
[1:01:58] now. I'm talking to the young men who
[1:02:00] have already
[1:02:04] married. I'm talking to them
[1:02:08] now. It's a journey.
[1:02:10] I said is a
[1:02:12] journey filled with
[1:02:15] moments that are sometimes difficult.
[1:02:21] When you get to that
[1:02:23] journey, you must know that I'm going to
[1:02:26] face some
[1:02:28] moments that will be sometimes
[1:02:32] difficult and sometimes
[1:02:35] easy. There will be happiness in the
[1:02:40] journey. There will be sadness in the
[1:02:44] journey. But is a journey.
[1:02:49] But you must
[1:02:51] know that love must be the
[1:02:56] compass and understanding must be the
[1:03:02] map and then trust must be the guiding
[1:03:10] star. There must be trust between the
[1:03:14] two. Are you listening to the marriage
[1:03:17] counselor?
[1:03:21] It is a commitment between the two
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:26] people who promise to stand by each
[1:03:32] other. These two they have been
[1:03:36] standing by each
[1:03:40] other. They were they stand by each
[1:03:43] other for a long time.
[1:03:47] They are going to renew their
[1:03:52] vows and they will continue to stand by
[1:03:55] each
[1:03:58] other. Yes, they've seen some up and
[1:04:03] downs in their journey of
[1:04:06] marriage. They've already seen
[1:04:09] those. But they must go
[1:04:13] on. They must keep on going
[1:04:20] on. It is not for
[1:04:27] cowards. Marriage is not for
[1:04:31] cowards. Cowards must not
[1:04:38] marry. It is a celebration of
[1:04:40] partnership.
[1:04:43] [Music]
[1:04:45] and
[1:04:50] companionship and love
[1:04:54] story that should not
[1:04:57] [Music]
[1:04:59] end. It is the partnership and
[1:05:02] companionship.
[1:05:03] [Music]
[1:05:06] If that partnership and
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:11] companionship, if it is not woven
[1:05:14] together by the word of
[1:05:18] God, it will never it will truly never
[1:05:22] it will truly
[1:05:25] end. It must be woven
[1:05:30] together by the word of God.
[1:05:34] It is it is a cornerstone
[1:05:39] that strengthened and increases
[1:05:47] families. It
[1:05:50] strengthens and it increases
[1:05:55] families. Those who were not families
[1:05:59] before, they are going to be families
[1:06:01] now.
[1:06:05] But it also
[1:06:09] can break
[1:06:15] families. It
[1:06:17] increases and creates the sense of
[1:06:20] belonging.
[1:06:21] [Music]
[1:06:27] offers a warm
[1:06:30] embrace for
[1:06:37] individuals to share their
[1:06:42] lives. There are certain signs that
[1:06:46] indicates that your marriage is in
[1:06:48] trouble.
[1:06:50] [Music]
[1:06:57] One sign, the first
[1:07:00] sign is communication
[1:07:06] breakdown. When communication breakdown
[1:07:10] [Music]
[1:07:12] starts, it shows that this marriage is
[1:07:15] going into trouble.
[1:07:21] Next
[1:07:23] point is the lack of intimacy.
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:31] When the leg of intimacy
[1:07:37] comes,
[1:07:39] this this this this
[1:07:46] newborn is going to
[1:07:50] die. The third is infidelity.
[1:07:53] Infidelity. Invitality.
[1:08:02] When that
[1:08:04] comes know that you are leading into the
[1:08:08] a
[1:08:12] dish, constant
[1:08:17] fighting and so on and
[1:08:22] so addressing these challenges
[1:08:25] [Music]
[1:08:27] It requires the
[1:08:30] following but not limited to
[1:08:34] this. It requires
[1:08:40] patience, requests above
[1:08:46] challenges. When you when you are
[1:08:49] solving the above challenges I've
[1:08:54] said, it needs
[1:08:58] patience from both sides.
[1:09:03] It needs
[1:09:06] understanding both
[1:09:09] sides. It needs
[1:09:13] compromise. Both
[1:09:16] sides. You may stand up the you.
[1:09:30] The marriage officer is handing over to
[1:09:32] the pastor.
[1:09:38] Now the pastor is taking
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:49] over. You also can stand up.
[1:09:57] I'm going to ask you this question.
[1:10:00] [Music]
[1:10:02] started this one.
[1:10:08] You must tell me your
[1:10:13] name and you must tell me your
[1:10:16] relationship with the one you are
[1:10:18] standing next to.
[1:10:26] [Music]
[1:10:34] My name is
[1:10:35] Finid and this is my sister.
[1:10:41] [Applause]
[1:10:43] Are you I'm still asking are you
[1:10:45] satisfied?
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:50] The the unity of the two is all
[1:10:59] right from where they started to be
[1:11:05] together. And you are sure that they
[1:11:07] will go on the way they were.
[1:11:20] from
[1:11:29] he says I believe I and since they were
[1:11:34] together and we met everything has been
[1:11:36] well. Thank you Mercy.
[1:11:44] Can you tell me your name
[1:11:47] and relationship with the one standing
[1:11:58] next? I
[1:12:04] am the one standing next to me is my
[1:12:07] father.
[1:12:11] You are you are bringing your father to
[1:12:14] be united with this one.
[1:12:22] Yes.
[1:12:23] Are you satisfied?
[1:12:29] I am very
[1:12:35] happy men. You are fortunate.
[1:12:40] Because in these cases daughters they
[1:12:44] are not.
[1:12:52] Maybe you may take your seat.
[1:12:57] You can take your seat then go to sit
[1:12:59] wherever you want to go to
[1:13:03] sit so that I can remain with the
[1:13:12] um I'm not going to uh read
[1:13:16] the this vows the way they are here.
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:27] I will require and will challenge you
[1:13:31] [Music]
[1:13:35] both as you
[1:13:37] surely answer at the day of
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:44] judgment. When the secrets of all hearts
[1:13:47] shall be disclosed,
[1:13:54] that if either of you know any
[1:14:03] impediment, why should you not be
[1:14:05] lawfully joined? Why should you not be
[1:14:09] lawfully be
[1:14:12] rejoined and continue together?
[1:14:25] In this holy
[1:14:30] matrimony, do you now confess it? If
[1:14:35] there is any impedment, you must now
[1:14:38] confess it.
[1:14:44] For be it assured unto you,
[1:14:49] that any person that are joined
[1:14:51] otherwise than God's word does
[1:15:00] allow marriage is not
[1:15:05] lawful. That's why you have decided
[1:15:11] you that you should bring your marriage
[1:15:14] to God.
[1:15:18] Because marriage belongs to
[1:15:21] God. It does not belong to the
[1:15:23] magistrate.
[1:15:26] It does not belong to our wish doctors.
[1:15:32] But it belongs to
[1:15:35] God. You are
[1:15:37] blessed for doing that.
[1:15:41] as earth.
[1:15:43] But believing that you have truly
[1:15:45] considered this solemn obligation,
[1:15:52] you are about to
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:15:56] assume that you have prepared to
[1:16:01] enter upon the same
[1:16:05] reverently,
[1:16:07] wisely, and in the fear of God.
[1:16:12] I shall propose to you the marriage
[1:16:18] covenant. We declare the same as you
[1:16:20] join your right hand.
[1:16:23] Come close
[1:16:28] together. Come
[1:16:35] together right together.
[1:16:51] Next, I will start with you. By the way,
[1:16:54] what is your
[1:16:59] name? Johnala.
[1:17:04] Start with you, John.
[1:17:07] John, will you continue to take this
[1:17:10] woman
[1:17:14] to be your lawful
[1:17:19] [Music]
[1:17:22] weather? And will you continue to live
[1:17:26] together in this holy state of
[1:17:32] [Music]
[1:17:33] matrimony? You promise
[1:17:38] to continue to love
[1:17:41] her, to honor
[1:17:44] her, and to cherish
[1:17:47] her in sickness,
[1:17:51] in
[1:17:52] health, in
[1:17:54] riches or poverty.
[1:17:57] Will do you promise
[1:18:01] that you will forsake all
[1:18:05] others and leave thee only unto
[1:18:11] her. As long as you both
[1:18:16] live. If it is
[1:18:19] so, say I win.
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:24] I win.
[1:18:27] Yes, I will.
[1:18:29] [Applause]
[1:18:34] You have prove that you are not a
[1:18:36] coward.
[1:18:42] Will you sister? What is the name of
[1:18:46] sister?
[1:18:48] Patience. Patience. Sister patience.
[1:18:53] Sister patience.
[1:18:56] Sister patience, will you continue to
[1:18:59] take this man to be your lawful wed
[1:19:07] [Music]
[1:19:11] husband? And will you continue to live
[1:19:14] together with him in this holy
[1:19:17] matrimony?
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:25] Do you promise to continue to love her,
[1:19:30] to love and honor him?
[1:19:37] You promise to cherish him
[1:19:42] in
[1:19:44] sickness and
[1:19:46] health,
[1:19:48] riches and poverty.
[1:19:52] Do you
[1:19:55] promise to continue and forsake all
[1:19:59] others and leave unto thee?
[1:20:09] only unto
[1:20:11] him. As long as you both
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:16] live, if it is
[1:20:19] so, say, I
[1:20:27] will. I will do it.
[1:20:34] I like what you have done
[1:20:38] because you have decided to bring your
[1:20:41] marriage to
[1:20:48] God. Uh if there is
[1:20:52] some covenant sign
[1:20:58] tokens, will you bring them? Sir,
[1:21:03] [Music]
[1:21:16] thank you. God bless you.
[1:21:22] [Music]
[1:21:29] Stay anything inside. Nothing.
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:42] Take this thing outside
[1:21:47] here. Put them on my Bible. All of them.
[1:21:52] [Music]
[1:22:02] Take them out. Put them in.
[1:22:07] [Music]
[1:22:29] Let's pray.
[1:22:33] My dear heavenly father, these are the
[1:22:37] tokens. Some people I used to take this
[1:22:40] thing and place them in their different
[1:22:43] fingers.
[1:22:45] But I believe these ones are placed in
[1:22:48] your
[1:22:50] weight. You are looking at
[1:22:53] them. Bless this token before they can
[1:22:57] place them in their fingers. I pray
[1:23:01] heavenly father in the name of Jesus
[1:23:04] Christ. Amen.
[1:23:06] You take the one for your
[1:23:11] wife and place it in her
[1:23:19] finger. And when you are placing them in
[1:23:22] in her
[1:23:26] finger, reassure her of your love.
[1:23:36] Reassure her
[1:23:41] that you still love her.
[1:23:45] After that long
[1:23:47] time, you are still for
[1:23:54] her. You can do it.
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:05] Hey,
[1:24:09] [Music]
[1:24:15] wa Sheep.
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:37] My love, the flower of my heart.
[1:24:40] [Music]
[1:24:44] I thank God by this
[1:24:49] day that I'm here in front of God.
[1:24:52] Exactly.
[1:25:03] If this marriage God is not there then
[1:25:06] all is in vain. Exactly.
[1:25:10] [Music]
[1:25:17] I met you before we were believers.
[1:25:25] But it was in vain because God was not
[1:25:28] there yet.
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:35] But God has helped us all the way that
[1:25:37] we might come this morning in front of
[1:25:44] God. I'm inserting this ring.
[1:25:53] I'm saying let's continue. I still love
[1:25:56] you
[1:26:01] as you also respect
[1:26:07] me. We have been together for so long.
[1:26:12] We are from
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:17] far. You have never surprised me.
[1:26:25] There might be mistake that I have done
[1:26:27] against
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:31] you. You have been patient with me and
[1:26:33] forgiven
[1:26:43] me. I believe from your family. I never
[1:26:46] went there to report you for something.
[1:26:55] even on my side. Even if if ever there
[1:26:58] are mistakes that you have
[1:27:03] done, he never went to my family to ask
[1:27:07] for help.
[1:27:14] In all our mistakes, it was for us to
[1:27:17] sit and communicate together and forgive
[1:27:20] each
[1:27:22] other. I'm thankful for your long
[1:27:26] patience
[1:27:29] patient and your
[1:27:32] respect. I love you.
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:28:02] It's the second pool. It's a second
[1:28:05] pool.
[1:28:11] I'm saying may our love continue.
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:16] I
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:25] believe as our pastor has just asked us
[1:28:28] that are we going to be patient with
[1:28:30] each other in everything that will
[1:28:35] happen is what I believe because I've
[1:28:38] already seen it in you. Amen.
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:28:52] The third.
[1:28:55] This is the
[1:29:05] third. I believe that God has blessed
[1:29:08] us.
[1:29:12] We have walked this journey for a long
[1:29:14] time.
[1:29:16] We have been from one church to another.
[1:29:20] [Music]
[1:29:22] But by the grace of God, he has shown us
[1:29:25] the
[1:29:26] place where he is.
[1:29:32] So I'm saying let's go on. God bless.
[1:29:37] It's not easy.
[1:29:42] But God has helped us to be where we are
[1:29:44] now. Amen.
[1:29:46] Because God is a place.
[1:29:50] Let's hold on.
[1:29:55] In one of the days,
[1:30:00] the word says in one of the days there
[1:30:02] was a king
[1:30:05] who called Aarez.
[1:30:10] [Music]
[1:30:14] Oh, he wanted to have a wife, King
[1:30:21] Aarus. The dms themselves were called
[1:30:24] from all the countries that was under
[1:30:30] him. They came together in the house of
[1:30:33] the king.
[1:30:37] The word says they were given
[1:30:44] ointments and they were supposed to make
[1:30:47] up themselves for six
[1:30:53] months. The next six months they were
[1:30:55] given
[1:30:59] perfumes so that they can be acceptable
[1:31:02] before the king.
[1:31:08] But there was a dark cell
[1:31:17] called the Bible says the one who looks
[1:31:22] after the maidens who was trusted by the
[1:31:24] king liked her.
[1:31:31] It says he took him and gave her a
[1:31:33] special
[1:31:36] room and gave her the
[1:31:39] required things to
[1:31:45] use. When the time for the dumpsters to
[1:31:49] contest before the king,
[1:31:54] they were coming and going, coming and
[1:31:57] going.
[1:31:59] There was no one that was accepted by
[1:32:02] the
[1:32:05] king because what the king required was
[1:32:09] not in them.
[1:32:15] [Music]
[1:32:23] The word says she was given all that was
[1:32:32] required because a guy knew the
[1:32:35] character that the king
[1:32:41] wanted when she move out to go and meet
[1:32:45] the king.
[1:32:51] Okay. Everyone was given what she
[1:32:54] required to meet the
[1:32:58] king. But when Esther went to meet the
[1:33:04] king, she required nothing save what she
[1:33:08] was given only by her God.
[1:33:13] Today we have our guy.
[1:33:18] Who
[1:33:25] is who has been given what the king
[1:33:31] requires. We are under the third pool
[1:33:34] ministry.
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:40] We are under the seven seal
[1:33:47] ministry. Those things has been given to
[1:33:50] our
[1:33:54] own. It is the only way for us to meet
[1:33:58] our Christ.
[1:34:00] [Music]
[1:34:07] There's nothing else that Christ will
[1:34:09] require from us except what we are being
[1:34:12] given by our
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:22] pastor.
[1:34:26] He's the one that we must hold on until
[1:34:29] we reach our destination.
[1:34:32] Thank
[1:34:34] you. God bless you.
[1:34:39] Sister, now is your
[1:34:41] time. It's your time to crown your
[1:34:44] husband.

[1:35:54] It was troubling me.
[1:35:58] It was troubling me a lot.
[1:36:02] But
[1:36:04] God said, "I will give you the husband
[1:36:07] who will be yours.
[1:36:11] You are mine, my brother." Hallelujah.
[1:36:21] God has given me.

[1:37:08] Maka that he preaches.
[1:37:20] Even now I'm so lively. I feel like I'm
[1:37:23] far away.
[1:37:29] I'm closer with God.

[1:37:39] I loved you.
