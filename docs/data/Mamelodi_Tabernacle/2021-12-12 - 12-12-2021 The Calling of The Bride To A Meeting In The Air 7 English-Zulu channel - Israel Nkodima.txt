welcome you better than yesterday father god you are a good god indeed the prayer requests have been brought to your attention we know even your father in the olden days there was a sick child too whereby people thought that parents had sinned that's why you were punishing the child but you said no no it's the same thing this morning we still throw the same strength we have given unto them then you are a good god again this morning once your children realize that they should all bring their prayer requests unto you their new heavenly father before the foundation of the world that all has been given unto them so we access and we manifest this morning lord with this prayer so that we may bless and you may heal them father god there are those that will be traveling to and fro all over

do but you know better may you protect your children wherever they are may you visit our houses lord you are the same yesterday today and forever you never disappointed us lord we still believe in you because heavenly father the bible teaches us that we have done everything before the foundation of the world if the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and our sins were forgiven before before the foundation of the weather even the healing as well heavenly father we were healed before the foundation of this weather this morning is nothing but just the manifestation because 2000 years back was the manifestation at the cross father god we want to thank you for everything we know what has put before you this morning come the next sunday is the testimony father god i know there's a list from the sister churches all over the nine provinces they are streaming this morning they didn't have an opportunity to phone our brother for their prayer request but our brothers are going to and fro during the week praying for the people may you hear them lord in the name of our lord jesus christ we know better this morning that when we present everything before thee it is already been granted we just wait for the right time we just relax and cruise upon your weight so that you give us always what is true unto us father god visit our heart visit us this morning an angel of the church will be standing behind the pulpit this morning [Music] when you incarnate yourself in him may you incarnate yourself amongst us so that when he's speaking is the deep calling to the team now

baptized we try to accommodate them by all means but you need to communicate with us in advance amen may the lord richly bless you if you are not on the list it becomes a challenge because we only
