[35:42] us gracious heavenly father there is no
[35:45] other God who can do
[35:47] it you are the only God gracious
[35:50] Lord who have chosen
[35:53] yourself to be father in within us as
[35:57] your bride right as your thir Throne
[36:00] Lord you don't work father anywhere but

[36:09] when you talk to us you talk to us
[36:10] through your throne hallu when you want

[36:32] what you want to say unto us as your
[36:34] bride we like to thank you Father we are
[36:37] living in the critical times I remember
[36:41] Lord the Bible says one day during the
[36:44] time gracious heavenly father when
[36:47] people were thinking so many wrong
[36:49] things and father you decided that I
[36:52] will destroy people Lord and you did
[36:56] that father through what
[36:58] because people Lord were looking at
[37:01] their thinking capacity was wrong they
[37:04] never thought about you Lord but father
[37:08] today you have said father it's not
[37:10] going to be water anymore but father you
[37:13] will use the fire but we like to thank

[37:45] spoke to
[37:46] Abraham and the Lord was just following
[37:49] Abraham but God never spoke to him that
[37:52] is why Lord did Father wrong things when

[1:05:26] may the Lord richly bless
[1:05:28] them amen amen I just want to remind
[1:05:33] everyone about our
[1:05:40] conference I believe we have all paid
[1:05:43] our conference
[1:05:47] fee hallelujah hallelujah we have paid
[1:05:51] deposit for the accommodation
[1:05:57] and
[1:06:00] Catering this
[1:06:02] year we are not going to
[1:06:07] allow people coming during the
[1:06:09] conference with
[1:06:13] money to
[1:06:16] enlist for
[1:06:18] catering we tried it last year it didn't
[1:06:21] work for
[1:06:23] us so we advise everybody to pay the
[1:06:27] deposit for
[1:06:31] catering we also
[1:06:34] realized that inside the premises of the
[1:06:40] conference there is no place where they
[1:06:43] sell
[1:06:45] food so in case you want to buy
[1:06:49] food you have to go outside the premises
[1:06:52] of the conference
[1:06:57] and that is also
[1:07:00] risky because you may be targeted by
[1:07:07] criminals we had a number of incident
[1:07:11] incidences last
[1:07:13] year so we advise
[1:07:17] Believers to avoid saying during the
[1:07:23] break to avoid during the break to go
[1:07:26] and say they going to buy
[1:07:31] food some they want to walk to the
[1:07:36] garage and they being
[1:07:39] targeted so we advise everyone to enlist
[1:07:44] for
[1:07:47] catering hallelujah
[1:07:49] hallelujah at the moment I'm sure we are
[1:07:52] all preparing to finalize our payment
[1:07:58] God bless
[1:07:59] you just to remind the
[1:08:03] Believers about parking
[1:08:06] parking H we have requested about two
[1:08:11] elderly
[1:08:14] men
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:16] to watch over the car
[1:08:22] outsite so
[1:08:25] avoid the criminals targeting our
[1:08:32] cars so the little that we give for
[1:08:39] parking we give those elderly men
[1:08:44] outside just to say Thank
[1:08:47] you so we humbly ask
[1:08:51] you to pay for the parking
[1:08:57] H we prefer that you bring the cash to
[1:09:05] pay to pay for the
[1:09:08] parking some say they deposited into the
[1:09:13] bank but the
[1:09:15] preference is for you to come and pay
[1:09:19] for the
[1:09:21] parking every Sunday

[1:09:28] bless

[1:23:44] him I didn't think I will preach to
[1:23:50] him I refused when he was asking me to
[1:23:54] preach
[1:23:58] perhaps it was that L him to be
[1:24:05] sick so that they can come and
[1:24:09] preach because I
[1:24:14] would um as we have said
[1:24:21] last about the second coming of the
[1:24:28] lord The
[1:24:31] Rapture and then we have spoken about
[1:24:35] it that we have got the first we have
[1:24:39] got three
[1:24:42] comings we have uh the first coming was
[1:24:46] for him to come and redeem us
[1:24:54] and the second coming is for him to come
[1:24:57] and take us
[1:25:01] home which is
[1:25:04] Rapture and the thirth coming is when he
[1:25:07] when he will be coming with
[1:25:11] us which is Revelation chapter
[1:25:16] 19 coming with us into
[1:25:20] [Music]
[1:25:22] Millennium you see people mix this
[1:25:29] comings because they don't understand
[1:25:31] the
[1:25:34] Rapture they believe that the Rapture is
[1:25:38] when we go people go to
[1:25:46] judgment and we also had the three
[1:25:51] raptures we had three raptures in the
[1:25:53] Old Testament
[1:25:58] the first one was that of
[1:26:01] Enoch and the second was that of
[1:26:05] Elijah and the third was of Jesus
[1:26:10] Christ it was three raptures in the Old
[1:26:16] Testament then we have got we will have
[1:26:19] three raptures in the new test
[1:26:25] then we have got already
[1:26:28] two we have got already
[1:26:32] one the one of those old
[1:26:37] Saints who
[1:26:40] resurrected when Jesus
[1:26:43] resurrected and the Bible says they were
[1:26:46] they have been seen by
[1:26:49] people and they were raptured with him
[1:26:54] he rul with him when he was rising
[1:26:58] up and when he rise up to
[1:27:03] heaven and they rose up with
[1:27:07] him it was the first
[1:27:10] [Music]
[1:27:12] first in the New
[1:27:15] Testament and the second one will be the
[1:27:18] Rapture for
[1:27:22] us that will the second in the New
[1:27:27] Testament and the third one will be
[1:27:29] Revelation chapter
[1:27:35] 11 of those two
[1:27:39] witnesses that one will be the third
[1:27:41] [Music]
[1:27:44] Rapture now we are talking about the our
[1:27:49] Rapture which is called the second
[1:27:52] coming of the Lord
[1:27:56] and we have said to understand the
[1:27:58] second
[1:28:02] coming you must first understand his
[1:28:05] first
[1:28:10] coming and we have said prophets
[1:28:12] prophesied about his first his first
[1:28:19] coming until the last prophet Malachi
[1:28:25] prophesied about that first
[1:28:30] coming prophesying about the God sending
[1:28:33] his
[1:28:36] Messenger to prepare the way before
[1:28:40] him and prophesying about him coming to
[1:28:44] his
[1:28:47] Temple we have said you see it was it
[1:28:50] was very difficult for people to believe
[1:28:57] to understand what type of a temple was
[1:29:02] it because God has already commanded
[1:29:08] Moses to build a
[1:29:11] temple because he wanted to dwell with
[1:29:15] them it was the Commandment of
[1:29:19] God for Moses to build the temple
[1:29:24] and Moses built the
[1:29:26] temple when the prophet Malachi
[1:29:31] says when he says God is coming to his
[1:29:35] Temple they believe that the only
[1:29:40] Temple that God would come
[1:29:43] to it was that Temple which was built by
[1:29:48] Moses because it was the Commandment of
[1:29:52] God
[1:29:54] they were there in the temple Waiting
[1:29:57] for God to come
[1:30:01] in but God was coming into a different
[1:30:08] temp Bible
[1:30:10] says that coming was was a
[1:30:17] press it wasn't just a
[1:30:21] coming because while they were waiting
[1:30:23] and singing in the
[1:30:28] temple Vision made the
[1:30:32] angel we have talked about
[1:30:34] that then there there was the the
[1:30:37] meeting of the Angel and the
[1:30:42] vision and there was
[1:30:45] pregnancy and there was
[1:30:48] B there was
[1:30:52] growth then
[1:30:55] until we get to methew chapter
[1:30:59] 3 methew chapter
[1:31:02] 3 it was John
[1:31:05] there and John was his
[1:31:10] forun when he was
[1:31:13] there baptizing people the temple
[1:31:17] came which was
[1:31:20] Jesus when the temple came there
[1:31:24] then John was looking at the
[1:31:27] temple and he
[1:31:29] refused he said I'm not with to baptize
[1:31:36] you you must baptize
[1:31:41] me that was the
[1:31:44] meeting let me just read for you
[1:31:47] some he
[1:31:50] says that was the reason when Jesus
[1:31:53] walked in the
[1:31:57] water John looked
[1:32:00] over and he seen that dve coming
[1:32:04] down he said Behold the Lamb of
[1:32:08] God there he
[1:32:10] is he is come he is the one that will
[1:32:13] take away the sin of the
[1:32:17] world Jesus walked right straight into
[1:32:21] the water
[1:32:24] to
[1:32:25] him them two eyes of John made the two
[1:32:29] eyes of
[1:32:32] Jesus they were second cousins by flesh
[1:32:36] they were second
[1:32:39] [Music]
[1:32:41] cousins Mary and Elizabeth were first
[1:32:47] cousin their eyes met one
[1:32:50] another there was God than his prophet
[1:32:56] amen standing
[1:32:59] there and his
[1:33:01] Prophet who can believe
[1:33:05] that a man come into the
[1:33:08] water they say
[1:33:11] it's there was a man in the
[1:33:14] water Bing people they say he was the
[1:33:18] prophet
[1:33:21] of John said
[1:33:24] I have need to be baptized of
[1:33:27] [Music]
[1:33:28] thee why Come Thou to
[1:33:31] me Jesus said suffer it to be to be so
[1:33:36] now but
[1:33:38] remember thus it behoved us to fulfill
[1:33:42] all
[1:33:45] righteousness why did John do it because
[1:33:49] he was the
[1:33:52] sacrifice John was a
[1:33:55] prophet he knew that the sacrifices
[1:33:58] going to be
[1:34:02] swashed before it is
[1:34:06] [Music]
[1:34:07] presented he suffered
[1:34:10] him and he baptized
[1:34:13] him when he had when he
[1:34:16] had the heaven
[1:34:20] open oh my that D come down upon
[1:34:26] him a voice said this is my beloved
[1:34:31] Son in whom I am pleased to dwell
[1:34:36] in go the God
[1:34:40] himself saying this is my beloved
[1:34:44] Son in whom I am pleased to dwell
[1:34:49] in God and man becoming one
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:34:57] God coming into his
[1:35:00] Temple through seven Church
[1:35:04] ages he was there preparing his
[1:35:10] Temple his second coming must be a
[1:35:14] process
[1:35:19] also because here it was the Fulfillment
[1:35:23] of Mal chter
[1:35:27] 3 it was God who was spoken by
[1:35:33] Malachi who who promised in
[1:35:37] Malachi that he will come to his
[1:35:40] temper now he was coming to his
[1:35:43] temp it was his first
[1:35:47] coming you see it was a
[1:35:51] process even now
[1:35:54] it his second
[1:35:57] coming it must be a
[1:36:03] processen it mustn't it must just be
[1:36:06] like
[1:36:08] that a
[1:36:11] proes but people
[1:36:13] won't agree or see
[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:19] it but it must be a process
[1:36:26] he says now you see the
[1:36:31] seals when he was in historial work back
[1:36:38] there
[1:36:40] redeeming but someday he comes forth to
[1:36:44] get this
[1:36:48] book we know through seven
[1:36:52] church he was
[1:36:56] imediator we
[1:36:58] know when he was immediated
[1:37:01] there in each Church
[1:37:04] age there was
[1:37:08] m m and
[1:37:11] women who were part of this
[1:37:17] artion because in each
[1:37:20] age God send a messenger
[1:37:25] because to believe
[1:37:28] him to be his
[1:37:31] child is when you could
[1:37:35] recognize in your
[1:37:38] age the one God has
[1:37:41] sent then you become his child
[1:37:45] there this is the Simplicity of the word
[1:37:49] of God
[1:37:53] because people would go to the
[1:37:57] mountain even in Jesus
[1:37:59] time they asked him what can we do to do
[1:38:04] your
[1:38:06] work he said to do my
[1:38:08] work is when you believe the one he has
[1:38:13] sent but they couldn't
[1:38:16] understand they want to believe
[1:38:20] Jehovah that is how people are doing
[1:38:24] even now people they want to believe
[1:38:27] Jesus they want to be the children of
[1:38:31] Jesus they want to be one with
[1:38:34] Jesus but they don't know what God
[1:38:38] say in each
[1:38:40] age God has one who he has
[1:38:45] sent and he want people to
[1:38:51] recognize if the people have recognize
[1:38:54] the one he has
[1:38:56] sent those who have
[1:38:59] recognized they what we call Total
[1:39:04] [Applause]
[1:39:06] settlement those who have
[1:39:09] recognized the one who has
[1:39:14] sent even in Esther's
[1:39:18] time those Visions failed
[1:39:24] because after they've been
[1:39:27] taught that they are going to meet the
[1:39:31] king and they must get into that
[1:39:34] house to get something to put
[1:39:38] on they thought they will use their own
[1:39:42] minds
[1:39:44] there there was a man
[1:39:47] there called her guy who was the the
[1:39:51] king seven
[1:39:54] who knows the
[1:39:56] king if you want to please the king you
[1:40:00] must take all what this man told
[1:40:04] you in
[1:40:07] age there was a messenger there those
[1:40:11] who believe that
[1:40:13] messenger those who have
[1:40:16] recognized that messenger and believe
[1:40:20] the message of that messenger
[1:40:24] they were part of this
[1:40:26] group they were part of the group of the
[1:40:32] Rapture
[1:40:34] Hallelujah let me say my brother they
[1:40:37] part of
[1:40:40] us
[1:40:43] amen they believe their message their
[1:40:47] message was enough for
[1:40:51] them that was the
[1:40:55] evidence that they have got the spirit
[1:40:57] of
[1:40:59] God Joshua and
[1:41:02] Kaleb they had a they had another
[1:41:07] spirit so they could believe the one
[1:41:12] God but there was go and that and
[1:41:16] there respectable
[1:41:19] man but they couldn't see the one God
[1:41:22] they sent
[1:41:25] they know this man is
[1:41:28] Moses because they like that
[1:41:38] spirit let
[1:41:41] me when he was in his medori work back
[1:41:47] there during seven
[1:41:49] Church redeeming
[1:41:54] someday he comes forth to get this
[1:41:58] book that he has
[1:42:02] red all that is in this
[1:42:05] book will be
[1:42:10] him for that is the that is the
[1:42:14] believer the words in the
[1:42:18] book and the word is him
[1:42:23] all that is in
[1:42:26] that he come forth for this
[1:42:29] book for
[1:42:32] Redemption whose names are written on
[1:42:35] that
[1:42:37] book the condition of the
[1:42:39] world when he was SL

[1:43:23] wake up we shall read them when we go
[1:43:26] off then at the
[1:43:29] end this
[1:43:31] L took that book because All Through the
[1:43:36] Ages he was doing that
[1:43:40] Redemption but when the ages has come to
[1:43:43] an
[1:43:45] end then we see

[1:51:04] prophet in
[1:51:07] second in first
[1:51:10] Thessalonians Paul was
[1:51:13] prophesying what was happening in our

[1:51:21] then now we are at the
[1:51:24] end of that
[1:51:27] process are you together with us because
[1:51:31] now he said the Lord
[1:51:35] himself shall ascend from
[1:51:40] heaven with a
[1:51:44] shout
[1:51:46] voice
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:49] and he is doing all these three

[1:52:15] message those who died
[1:52:18] before they are waiting for us
[1:52:25] he says here the messenger bringing the
[1:52:30] message because the shout is a
[1:52:34] message you can't have a message without
[1:52:37] the
[1:52:39] messenger the shout is a
[1:52:43] message the shout is a
[1:52:45] message then there is a
[1:52:49] messenger and if there is a messenger
[1:52:52] a messeng of someone is caring a
[1:52:56] message and if he's caring a message
[1:52:58] he's caring a message to
[1:53:01] somebody and this message is not the
[1:53:05] his is taking the message from
[1:53:09] someone and bring it to
[1:53:13] someone amen he is
[1:53:16] important this messenger is
[1:53:19] important when he is carrying the
[1:53:22] message
[1:53:23] when he has dropped the
[1:53:26] message he is no more
[1:53:29] important what is important
[1:53:33] now the message he has
[1:53:36] brought and all the attention
[1:53:41] now is in the messenger not the
[1:53:44] messenger because he has brought the
[1:53:47] message just
[1:53:51] like was a
[1:53:53] he was bringing
[1:53:55] re he brought Rea to
[1:53:58] Isaac when he brought re to Isaac his
[1:54:02] work was
[1:54:04] over now all things now were now looking
[1:54:10] at
[1:54:12] Rebeca because he was the one who was
[1:54:16] brought now all eyes now are in the
[1:54:21] bride
[1:54:26] because the prophet said
[1:54:29] here let me read it for
[1:54:33] you he
[1:54:35] says one night I was seeking the
[1:54:39] lot the Holy Spirit told
[1:54:42] me to pick up my
[1:54:46] pen and right as
[1:54:49] I I grabs my pent
[1:54:53] right the spirit his Spirit gave me a
[1:54:58] message for the church I wanted to bring
[1:55:02] it to you it has to do with the we and
[1:55:06] the
[1:55:08] Bri but I want to read something in the
[1:55:10] middle of the
[1:55:13] message you must he said go told
[1:55:18] him take your p and write this message
[1:55:23] is to the
[1:55:25] bride he said now here is the secret of
[1:55:30] this who was saying
[1:55:33] this it was the spirit of
[1:55:36] God telling the prophet he say here is
[1:55:40] the here is the secret of this the
[1:55:42] weight is in the
[1:55:45] bread as it was in
[1:55:48] Mary the bride has the mind of Christ
[1:55:53] for she knows what he wants to be done
[1:55:57] with the
[1:55:59] way she performs the command of the
[1:56:04] word in his
[1:56:06] name for she has thus say the
[1:56:11] Lord then the weight is quickened by the
[1:56:16] spirit and it comes to
[1:56:19] pass like a seed that is planted and
[1:56:24] water it comes to full
[1:56:27] harest saving his
[1:56:32] purpose this is what the prophet
[1:56:36] said he said now the word is in the
[1:56:44] bre this is what is happening
[1:56:49] now the
[1:56:51] shout is is a
[1:56:53] message calling the bride
[1:56:57] together for the
[1:56:59] Rapture because the Rapture is only for
[1:57:02] the
[1:57:06] bride the message is for
[1:57:10] the it's not for
[1:57:13] everybody as the Rapture is not for
[1:57:18] every the Rapture is for the bride
[1:57:22] now the Rapture is
[1:57:25] only this Rapture that we are talking
[1:57:29] about is only for the
[1:57:32] bride remember the Bible said and the
[1:57:36] rest of the Dead lived not for Thousand

[1:58:01] Rapture the Bible says there will
[1:58:05] be it will be only for the
[1:58:08] elected the elected
[1:58:12] lady the bride in the day that the Bri

[1:58:46] place gather
[1:58:49] together in the place and that
[1:58:53] is called the bright

[2:08:03] shout when he descending he the
[2:08:08] sh together the giggles together so that
[2:08:12] they can
[2:08:13] feed and be
[2:08:20] ready all right amen it says
[2:08:24] here let me read something
[2:08:26] here the same way he deal with
[2:08:31] Abraham he is dealing with Abraham
[2:08:38] City the last time Abraham
[2:08:42] saw it was a man it was God stand in a
[2:08:46] form of a
[2:08:48] man then after that Abraham's body
[2:08:53] changed Abram's body
[2:08:57] changed
[2:08:59] how let me just read something
[2:09:03] here The change was
[2:09:07] Jewel it was it was from it was within
[2:09:10] and
[2:09:12] upside are you together with because sah
[2:09:17] was
[2:09:18] buried he couldn't hold the seat
[2:09:23] in her womb her womb was not fit for
[2:09:27] receiving
[2:09:30] seed God had to change her from
[2:09:35] inside so that he can be a different
[2:09:41] from so that when can receive a
[2:09:45] SE after God has changed the hair from
[2:09:49] inside
[2:09:53] then he also change ha from
[2:09:56] outside that is that is how our change
[2:10:00] will
[2:10:03] be it will be from inside and
[2:10:09] outside what must change you from
[2:10:15] inside let me pass this one let me run
[2:10:18] to this one first
[2:10:21] this one I want to read it
[2:10:24] here it
[2:10:27] says the word you are
[2:10:32] receiving it is it must do something in
[2:10:36] you he said we cannot receive the
[2:10:39] promised son that is promised us
[2:10:45] today in this that you are living in
[2:10:49] [Music]
[2:10:51] bodies are the
[2:10:54] same it is this
[2:10:58] outside see tast feel
[2:11:01] smell
[2:11:03] here it's just is subject to
[2:11:07] die and will die but the inside part of
[2:11:12] you down in there inside that is the
[2:11:17] person that cannot
[2:11:19] die that that
[2:11:21] person that is where the New Life Starts
[2:11:24] [Music]
[2:11:25] from the
[2:11:28] new builds another
[2:11:31] person in the image of the person you
[2:11:37] are you must be changed from
[2:11:42] within you must be born again from
[2:11:48] within if you are changed from within
[2:11:53] then you will be changed
[2:11:56] outside I must be a new
[2:12:02] inside so that they can be changed
[2:12:05] outside and be a young
[2:12:08] man okay if I'm a young man
[2:12:11] outside but inside I'm still
[2:12:16] sinful that want help me I must be
[2:12:20] changed in
[2:12:23] when I am changed the inside then I can
[2:12:27] change the outside here that's why he
[2:12:32] says he says the
[2:12:34] word let me read it here again he says
[2:12:39] so potentially it is in
[2:12:42] here what it is we promised before the
[2:12:46] foundation of the
[2:12:49] world around there
[2:12:52] the only this only reflect the
[2:12:56] negative that will reflect the
[2:13:00] positive the weight and the same thing
[2:13:04] is the translation of the Bride will be
[2:13:07] the same
[2:13:09] thing the way that is in
[2:13:12] you the body will materialize around
[2:13:17] that and the same thing did by S
[2:13:23] [Music]
[2:13:25] she was changed
[2:13:27] from then then from within then it goes
[2:13:32] outside you are the word the word of God
[2:13:37] is the way that transforms you from
[2:13:42] within God send this
[2:13:45] way through the
[2:13:48] prophet so that it can you can receive
[2:13:50] it
[2:13:52] when you receive the weight
[2:13:55] inside that weight will transform you
[2:14:00] from the
[2:14:02] inside that is the
[2:14:05] cus that is the b word of the Son of
[2:14:09] God it is the way that is forming us
[2:14:13] that is the way that is the word upon
[2:14:15] the

[2:21:47] read something
[2:21:48] here for the last here let me pass other
[2:21:53] books there and read this
[2:21:57] one let me say it is the last
[2:22:01] one it says
[2:22:03] here I wonder if this
[2:22:07] ministry climbs out the same
[2:22:11] way in the last days as it
[2:22:14] was as as the father sent me so I send
[2:22:19] you
[2:22:21] The Works that they do shall you do also
[2:22:25] but what I want to read for you here I
[2:22:27] wonder if this
[2:22:29] ministry climbs out the same
[2:22:33] way because Jesus last
[2:22:38] minister is when he's preaching to
[2:22:43] the he says I I don't know if this
[2:22:47] ministry is not driving the same way
[2:22:53] if this ministry is not preaching to the
[2:22:56] those who are
[2:22:59] lost this why people are against this
[2:23:04] are against this
[2:23:05] ministry because it is the third
[2:23:10] pool because the third pool is the
[2:23:13] ministry of Jesus Christ of this
[2:23:18] time when he is
[2:23:21] all right let me let me go
[2:23:24] on he says here they all right now is
[2:23:29] there any
[2:23:30] question first pool he healed the
[2:23:35] sick that's right the Cong says amen his
[2:23:38] second Ministry he was prophesying his
[2:23:42] thir
[2:23:43] Ministry was preaching to the Eternal
[2:23:48] laws Ministry
[2:23:51] all
[2:23:53] Ministries the same
[2:23:55] way not
[2:23:57] preached that is exactly right he went
[2:24:00] into the ark when he went into the ark
[2:24:03] there were seven days that nothing
[2:24:07] happened he was in the AR seven days
[2:24:11] nothing
[2:24:13] happened his
[2:24:15] testimony preached to the
[2:24:21] amen we shall come back God bless
[2:24:28] you
[2:24:33] amen let's lose our
[2:24:36] eyes as we
[2:24:39] pray our heavly father thank
[2:24:43] you we are living in a terrible
[2:24:49] time but a good time for the bride
[2:24:53] amen
[2:24:56] because they can see their time is
[2:25:01] over they can
[2:25:03] feel that they no more belong
[2:25:07] here they belong to another
[2:25:11] place they are living here with other
[2:25:15] people just like when Mary was living
[2:25:18] with
[2:25:19] them not knowing what was inside
[2:25:23] Mary that's like Sarah when he go to
[2:25:26] with
[2:25:27] Abraham to that country where the king
[2:25:30] wanted to marry
[2:25:32] Sarah not knowing what happened to her
[2:25:36] that this what people are not knowing
[2:25:37] what is
[2:25:39] happening this is another Ministry amen
[2:25:42] people go on
[2:25:44] preaching thinking they're getting
[2:25:46] people
[2:25:47] saved but it is over amen am help us
[2:25:52] Lord because this time this food is only
[2:25:57] for the
[2:25:58] bride is not for The
