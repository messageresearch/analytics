I've traveled where God wanted me to go. I need to go. And while I was standing there, &gt;&gt; I asked God, God, &gt;&gt; I can't tell you what to do or not to do, &gt;&gt; but just don't take him in front of me. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "Don't take him in front of me." Then I called Edar. I tried calling pastor and then it was on a Sunday that day. &gt;&gt; So he's saying you are singing he's saying you think &gt;&gt; and then on Monday the cardiologist cameology &gt;&gt; she said the the heart is now failing. &gt;&gt; We need to boost And the kidney doctor also said, "No, it's getting very bad now." &gt;&gt; And they called us, um, they called me and Qua, &gt;&gt; the specialist there, specialist, &gt;&gt; he said to us, "You need to go home now, prepare for the worst because your father won't make it.

Sorry, &gt;&gt; we will wait on Dr. Jesus report [Applause] and then I'll just fast forward because of time and then the time came for him to go to theater because they wanted to see I think it's an angel they wanted to find out what is happening with the heart. The cardiologist came back to say &gt;&gt; both arteries are blocked &gt;&gt; and they've been blocked for a very long time. &gt;&gt; I don't even know how this person was leaving. We don't have a choice choice &gt;&gt; but we just have to insert I can't remember what do they call it's a permanent heart booster. And the the the specialist for the kidneys also told us no the kidneys are failing. We'll use a permanent booster also. &gt;&gt; And they said we need to sign a concern for the following day. And then on the 22nd of July, &gt;&gt; 22 July, &gt;&gt; we were sitting with Then we saw the nurses, &gt;&gt; all the nurses in the world, rushing to his word. We didn't know what was happening, &gt;&gt; but it was a a very scary moment. Then I started singing. &gt;&gt; We started singing that. Then from there suddenly we heard the nurses laughing. Then one of the nurses called us &gt;&gt; and she said, "Oh, your dad was gone. machines were off. We tried resuscitating him. It didn't work &gt;&gt; and we were just we were just thinking how we were going to even form you as a family. Suddenly your dad started talking. &gt;&gt; And then when we heard that I said, "Yeah, God wouldn't allow um him to be resuscitated. &gt;&gt; He's a giver of life." So, &gt;&gt; yes. And then &gt;&gt; when um during that same week, &gt;&gt; he was supposed to go for the for the boosters. Then the doctors came to say suddenly his organs are working. [Applause] is pumping on its own now. &gt;&gt; They started removing the machines. Sorry. &gt;&gt; They started removing all the connections. Then he started breathing on himself and the heart started beating. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the heart started beating on it. And the doctor said, "We don't know what's happening here. Then he's somehow back to normal &gt;&gt; and we're going to discharge him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he started walking. &gt;&gt; Ah, praise God. And um what amazed the the doctors and the nurses, &gt;&gt; they said um this patient, &gt;&gt; he always talks about rapture and even um once his books and while he was in ICU connected to the machines, &gt;&gt; he will always ask for for his books. And he said he was preparing for the rapture message and uh because of time I will just say we saw the hand of God. Yes, he's working. Hallelujah. All right. Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, see [Music] [Applause] I am [Music] [Music] Oh my god. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh let us pray. &gt;&gt; Indeed.

And Lord, sons of a king are kings themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why in this end time, Father, we are seeing such miracles happening. &gt;&gt; Even doctors can't understand. Even ourselves can't understand. &gt;&gt; But we know it is you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Nothing but the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for the healing of our pastor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for the testimonies.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Um I'm not in a hurry at all. &gt;&gt; Uh you know sometimes &gt;&gt; uh the same people who can listen to uh this politician talk for 20 minute 20 hours. I cannot listen to the message of God for 15 minutes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will start from very far. But uh the message today is the the restoration of the bride tree. I'll start from a strange book for such a message but it's the best where to start from. First Corinthians 1 verse one 1 verse one first Corinthians chapter 1 verse one. &gt;&gt; Yes. Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and sooththes our brother. Two &gt;&gt; unto the church of God which is at Corinth to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord both theirs and ours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can be seated. You can just put the scriptures there my brother. So we have been caught in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So if I call you to my house, the one who is calling is the one who has got purpose. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I say come to my house, &gt;&gt; I the one who is calling and no remove that one first. We'll get to that one. The one who is calling &gt;&gt; is the one who has got purpose. The book of Corinthians says we have been called to be saints who wanted us to be saints. The one who God brother sister I cannot be make you a saint neither can I desentify you. Because you have been called not by me. Somebody has called you. &gt;&gt; That's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So Paul said we have been called sanctified in Christ. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Sanctified in Christ. called. He told us, "Come, come, come." He was calling us, "Whoever wants to be a saint, come and we have responded. Who is making me to be a saint? Is it I myself or the one who is calling? Is your neighbor going to make you a saint? He He can't even share you money. How can he say he can't even help you with school fees? How can you be sharing this? This one is only by God. The one who has called us into this. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; take it as a very great calling. Amen. Amen. because our caller is a true to his word. Now you should know uh what we're trying to talk about today. There's a your part and there's a part which God has to do. Do your part. Let God do his part. Don't try to do the part of God. &gt;&gt; The word has been given to us from the book of Genesis all the way to the book of Revelation. And you find out my brother, my sister, the first book, which should have been the first book in the Bible is found in John 1:1. That's where the first book is. In the beginning was the word. That's the first chapter of the Bible. But God is a stammer. God is a stamaler. like Moses, Moses. God is a stammer. &gt;&gt; He doesn't speak like that. You know, Moses was speaking Hebrew, &gt;&gt; but it took Alon to translate Hebrew into Hebrew because that's the way God speaks. And then you find another another scripture which been which have been in the first book it's somewhere very far in the middle in the book of Isaiah that how how you have fallen you Lucifer that book should have been at the beginning and you even find in the book of revelation there was war in heaven because in the garden of Eden when Adam came the Bible is very good doesn't talk about the others it talks about the arrival of Adam how the devil arrived there doesn't tell you the Bible just talks about the trees elephants, the gods, and then it says there were two trees, the tree of life and the tree of knowledge. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; A Bible is a clean book. Doesn't talk about dirt things. But actually if I can I can I can tell you the truth. Knowledge &gt;&gt; is not about one + one. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says Adam knew his wife. The tree was a tree of what? The tree. But Adam knew his wife. So this tree was a tree of that knowledge not the knowledge which you come we take from university of pritori was a tree of that knowledge &gt;&gt; that is why the whole world you go to America you go to anywhere You can't sell a car until there's a a sexual looking like woman around you. You can't even buy buy a bar of soap without the knowledge being there. &gt;&gt; It was a tree of what? Knowledge. Unfortunately, you interpreted wrongly. Some of you thought it was a a tree of A= B² + C². Then they have they would have told you it was a tree of A²= B². Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe a lot of you understand me. Is anybody doing mric here? Those of you who understanding me, raise up your hand at a square. They understand me correctly. So this tree was not for a square= b². This was a tree that other knowledge because before they visited that tree they didn't have this other knowledge. That's why when they visited from this tree this the knowledge came whenever went there she went to get knowledge whenever &gt;&gt; was with this tree &gt;&gt; she got what &gt;&gt; knowledge &gt;&gt; that's where Cain came from because she visited the tree of &gt;&gt; knowledge. When Adam knew his wife, &gt;&gt; there came amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The tree of what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go and check in the dictionary. &gt;&gt; Not in the check the archaic dictionaries. It it will tell you that it was a tree of knowledge. What does knowledge mean? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when the fruits came, we talking about the restoration of the bright tree. These things have been like that from the beginning, running parallel to one another. So the Abel &gt;&gt; son of uh son of uh Adam &gt;&gt; when it came to him worshiping &gt;&gt; he had a revelation Cain &gt;&gt; didn't have a revelation you see there now the next thing all the time if you see There are two brothers striving one another. Don't worry about it. Always the wrong striving against the good. All the time. Be that good brother. Don't try to be an angry brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't help you. It doesn't help me. It doesn't help everybody. &gt;&gt; When uh we come to Ishmael and Isaac, you see that when it comes to this level Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something as well. &gt;&gt; Um, if you want to look at the trend of things before Adam came, Who was the first one to arrive on earth? &gt;&gt; According to the book of Isaiah, the devil already arrived in the house opera of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Who was the first one to arrive? Ishma. Ishma. &gt;&gt; In the house of Adam. Who was the first one to arrive? We take that &gt;&gt; the whole Bible. &gt;&gt; I find that always the devil is always a step ahead of us. Amen. Amen. So the bride tree which has come to us as according to the book of uh Genesis, the bride tree was a fruit tree with its own fruits. We come to the book of uh uh Acts when the bride tree Acts 2:38 &gt;&gt; When the bride tree came as a full grown tree. Amen. Amen. Now if you have a if you had a tree it has fruits sometimes you tend to wonder where did the tree disease in the tree come from you find some of the diseases are already inside the seat. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the law of God has always been like that. So if you come to the book of revelation, if you come to the revelation 6, my brother, &gt;&gt; revelation 6, revelation 6 uh verse verse one, we are talking about the destruation of the branch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6 verse one. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I saw when the lamp opened one of the seals, and I heard as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beast saying, "Come and see." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Full stop. &gt;&gt; The seal was opened &gt;&gt; and a thunder was held. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When a seal is open, comes &gt;&gt; as the message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So after that, &gt;&gt; what happened? &gt;&gt; Verse two. &gt;&gt; Verse two. &gt;&gt; And I saw and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, The message &gt;&gt; which is contained in the seal &gt;&gt; which you have heard. &gt;&gt; Remember John heard you are you also have heard the message. After you have heard the message, that's when you can see the other part. It was after Abel had heard the message from his father. [Music] That's when he knew pumpkins and leaves and what and cannot be offered for sacrifice. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now the book the way the Bible is written you find that the white horse rider and uh he's a white horse rider but if the seven se is not open to you you'll be lost because the white horse rider you have to go back to the book of the seven church ages to know who is a white horse rider which you'll find out that is none other than people holding the deeds of the neglectants those were the people which were the first uh horse riders Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you have to go back to the book of Joel. &gt;&gt; That's where you know that the necroans are a just write it down. You're going to find it out like that. Amen. What does the palmer do? &gt;&gt; It eats the fruits. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. Just leave it there so that people can can can be reading it with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if you go to Joel &gt;&gt; is no longer a white horse &gt;&gt; is a pawm. So the palm was there to get out the fruits. So God sent the beast power to meet these people. It was in the preaching. It was in the preaching. Hallelujah. Amen. So this palm started eating the fruits in the church of Ephesians in the church of all the way to pilg on 325 A 325 A you find it &gt;&gt; in the third book but yet it is still in the first seal but that a crown is given who was given a crown. Remember in the Ephesians it was about deeds but when it came to it was a doctrine. What type of doctrine was it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring it there. Let's see this. What type of doctrine was it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give me the uh the uh uh revelation chapter 2. Give me the pamos church h it's around verse 15. I believe &gt;&gt; from verse 12. I wait let me just cross check. &gt;&gt; Yes. Go down a little bit. I I just want to come to where the the doctrine is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come down where there's a doctrine of Balac. Amen. There we go. You see &gt;&gt; that's actually the first seal &gt;&gt; the doctrine of Balam who taught. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was the doctrine of Balam &gt;&gt; was changing money for prayer. What happened at Council? The church was sold the way Balam sold the Balam sold the church. Go and read. &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham says &gt;&gt; Constantine &gt;&gt; Constantine &gt;&gt; gave the marble uh marble pits houses and money. Which prophet in the Bible was selling his gift? Who? So who is Balac was Constantine? Constantine. Constantine Constantine &gt;&gt; knew from the beginning but that the brothers who had gone to Nessia Council were not the correct believers because go and read Josephus. He said, "Josephus, the brothers which went to this council even falsified the documents to make their deacons to make their deacons look as if they were pastors. Constantine knew they were looking for money. Constantine knew the real church is not here. aim was to divide and rule. Every church of God is supposed to guard against dividing and ruling. So what happened? We see that the the church was there. Constantine says, "Ah, you know, you know you people the problem which you have you don't have a leader. So choose one of you to become a leader and to be the pope. &gt;&gt; So that's why the Bible says a crown was was given. Have you seen the where the crown given &gt;&gt; where a crown was given? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where the church was sold. &gt;&gt; That's why it's a doctrine of &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We are finished with the doctrine of Balam. Doctrine of Balam when he comes is looking for money. And the one who gives the money is &gt;&gt; in the seals. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So where the sea was talking about a sword being given &gt;&gt; that's revelation 6 3 and 4 3 and 4. &gt;&gt; Let's look at that that one in the seals. and my brother. &gt;&gt; Revelation 6:3. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, "Come and see." And there went out another horse that was read, and power was given unto him that set there on to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. And there was given unto him a great sword. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So where was the sword given? You go back, where is it in the church ages where this happened? You go to the church of theater. Amen. Amen. That's where you find that the uh the the angel is talking to John about the woman Jezebel taking control. Jezebel &gt;&gt; her main duty is always killing. Even if he wants a vineyard one day was very sad, &gt;&gt; I want that field for that brother. just says just wait and so and so can I can you accuse that brother of doing this [Music] and they kill him I come to the husband go and take the field because that person is gone hallelujah amen you find that in the second seal God brought the uh spirit of an ox to fight Jezebel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe let's read. We shouldn't be in a rush. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 2 or three. I have the scriptures here. Unfortunately, my eyes are not helping me at all at at all. This Go to Revelation chapter 2. My brother chapter just find where the church church &gt;&gt; uh chapter 2 or chapter 3 &gt;&gt; chapter 2 verse 18. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And unto the church of unto the angel of the church in Thotira, write these things said the son of God who have his eyes like unto a flame of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his feet are like fine brass. Yes, &gt;&gt; I know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first. Notwithstanding, I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, &gt;&gt; which calleth herself a prophetist. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jezebel. &gt;&gt; Jezebel. the Catholic religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was supposed to have Rita today. Is Risa here? She hasn't arrived. She hasn't arrived. Okay. Risa. Yeah. God bless you. You need to come in front here. Come and sit here. You should be singing. Come. Amen. She's here. This is my daughter. &gt;&gt; Oh, she uh something good is happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. She's she's a daughter of my friend. Every time when I come here in South Africa, &gt;&gt; I stay at my friend's house and that's the daughter. &gt;&gt; And uh uh strangely she said, "I want to go to your church." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming, Luther. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I've known her since she was she's a friend my friend daughter. &gt;&gt; She wanted to be here &gt;&gt; because um sister do and believe were together at the wedding there. So the way she saw them says no I want to go to a church. God bless you mama. Amen. So today she was very fine in Ellensburg in Johansburg there. She gave problems. I want to come to church. I want to come to church. I want to come until we had to Uber her all the way to here. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. So Jezebel is the Catholic church. When was Jezebel the ruler of the world? &gt;&gt; It was during the church of the disposition of Theater. What happened in that time when Jezebel was ruling? &gt;&gt; Because she was Jezebel. What? What is the speed of Jezebel? is what killing that's why the great sword was given and if you come into the message of the hour you hear that the August St. Augustine of in 354 AD 354 you can just search that one my brother you'll find it said &gt;&gt; it is even good to kill those people who disagreed with the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church. &gt;&gt; What was that? That was a sword being given. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the first one of the worms of Joel was a palmer. &gt;&gt; What does a palmer do? &gt;&gt; It eats the fruits. &gt;&gt; What are the fruits? &gt;&gt; Joy, love, &gt;&gt; peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it eats the fruit. &gt;&gt; When it come to the second realm, which is the locust. What does it eat? It eats the leaves. What does the leaves stand for? Fellowship. So when Jezebel came with a sword killing people, fellowship was stopped. That's when people went into the catacombs. That's when people dispersed. What was the worm of that time? Locus dysfellowshipping people. Hallelujah. Amen. So when it is coming to that point, God sends the beasts to fight this. These were people who could just let Jezebel do everything what he want. God shall never have a time which he doesn't have a worshipper. [Music] Amen. Every time because of whatever can happen there will always be a true worship. Amen. Amen. If you can look at in the book of Moses, Janice and Jambre, &gt;&gt; they came to impersonate Moses. Who was there first? Janice and Jambre. &gt;&gt; I don't know my brother when that competition came. Moses throws a stick. It is a snake. &gt;&gt; And throw their sticks, their snakes. You know this witchcraft thing they learn from family to family to family generations. So the snake h the snake of Moses ate all those roots. Those people when they were going home they had a lot to explain because their children were asking where's our where's our stick. The wives were asking papa where's our stickes it has gone. &gt;&gt; Do you think they will like Moses for that? They lost a lot that day. Those those sticks were doing a lot for them. I hope no one maybe one of them was able to walk without the stick. That day I start struggle to get home because the stick was gone. &gt;&gt; Because God will always send a spirit to counteract everything you meet at work. Let one of your workmates start doing things against you and see what God will do to that [Music] because that's the way God does. God will always send the spirit for the specific this season. Amen. Amen. So when it came to the when it came to the spirit of u deception where the uh the devil started selling salvation sorry when the devil starts selling salvation that that was under the third seal send a spit of a man to counter like that they just shall live by faith. The devil lost again. He's always a loser. When it came to the last age, the devil mixed. God sent an eagle to go very high. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know an ego &gt;&gt; is born different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um every one of those animals which are before they all they lie on those are all breastfeeding animals. And if there are doctors here, they'll tell you there's there's disease in the breast milk. You get diseases &gt;&gt; because you're breastfeeding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. disease of the mother gets into you because of breastfeeding. All those animals before that they got cord attached to the mother. The doctors will tell you so many diseases come from the mother to the baby through the doctors. So they they say so. &gt;&gt; Yes. The doctor says &gt;&gt; the thing which makes you grow has got diseases as well coming. &gt;&gt; But when we are born an ego, &gt;&gt; you are born independently independent. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Sometimes you can be born as a B. But uh being bled as a bell doesn't make you an eagle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know these other birds are very dirty birds. The mother goes to eat food somewhere. It eats eats. When it comes to the next day, &gt;&gt; starts vomiting into your mouth. That's the way the other teach their children. They make them eat vomit. But an eagle, the mother goes to kill an animal. brings it to the child. The child eats on its own. The mother begs, eats. The young one begs and eats. They eat from the same animal at the same time. Fresh meat. not vomited meat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So as an eagle, &gt;&gt; you are so boundless, you are an animal of cleanliness. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when it comes to us, &gt;&gt; we are not just a normal build. And we are eager. There are so many people here who wants to vomit this to this one, vomit this to vomit this. Don't do that. Get yourself fresh. Fresh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are an eagle &gt;&gt; and you can fly. &gt;&gt; Sky is not a limit for you. It can be raining here in Pritoria. You just go above the rain. Yeah, I just go be fly above. &gt;&gt; You are an eagle. &gt;&gt; You are supposed to fry above your poor bread. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can see that the book of revelation you cannot read it until you read the book of uh you cannot look the you cannot read the seven seals because the seals are in the seven church ages. The seven church ages are in the book of Joel. The seals are in the book of Daniel. So if you have to read all this, can you eat through vomit? No, you have you have to pick it yourself together. Then you will see what Isaiah was speaking was the seven seals. What was there in the book of Genesis was in the seal. And some people start hating you for talking about seals too much. [Music] Which which Bible doesn't have seals? Because &gt;&gt; even if I can lead you, &gt;&gt; okay, let me just talk about the birth of Jesus is in the se because if you go to Revelation 12, it what does it say? Go there, my brother. Revelation 12:2. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And there appeared another wonder in heaven. And behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon his heads. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are believers. Who is that one? &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Who? Who has got seven heads, 10 horns, seven crowns? Who is that one? [Music] &gt;&gt; That's none other than Rome. When Jesus was being born, when Jesus was being born, that is the time which the Roman Empire was ruled by the most brilliant Caesar. A lot of people make a mistake. They think Julius Caesar was the greatest. Julius was not the greatest. &gt;&gt; The greatest was his nephew [Music] Augustus. &gt;&gt; Augustus that by the time Jesus was being born, the dragon &gt;&gt; had his head ready, which was Augustus Caesar. Augustus Caesar. If you can go to the book of Daniel, you will find that it says this power has got power to change deaths. Which of the emperors emperor &gt;&gt; who was able to change deaths up to now? &gt;&gt; Days. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The same days like Monday, Tuesday. Who Who was that? Who was that one? other than &gt;&gt; Augustus. &gt;&gt; Austo. &gt;&gt; That is why him being Augustus, &gt;&gt; he gave the month of August 31 days. &gt;&gt; Amen. His uncle is Julius &gt;&gt; and his mother's Julia. &gt;&gt; July 31 days. &gt;&gt; July 31. him was an Octavian October 31 days. &gt;&gt; He is the one who made use the modern calendar. How was he prepared to kill Jesus? At birth, at birth, Jesus wouldn't have survived. The very same time Jesus was supposed to be born, Augustus declares, everyone has to go back to their home village. [Music] and Mary &gt;&gt; and Joseph started going when the woman was already in tra they arrived. The woman was in tra. They asked for a for a place for the puppet to be born. All the doors were closed. Amen. Amen. And if they are okay the doctors which are here are going to tell you something before the mother the baby is born they start giving you shots for tetanus injection they do that here I don't know whether they do it but it should be done even here because it's one of the injections which the mother has to get before the baby is born to protect the baby from tetanus Where does Satan has come from? From &gt;&gt; of animals. The d of animals. &gt;&gt; Jesus went into the cowan. He was born in there at the home of tetanus by a mother who has never been delivered before. and he survived. Amen. &gt;&gt; They'll tell you if you are pricricked by a dirt and nail. &gt;&gt; Yes. They they they have to give you uh they have to give you a ton short because it's dirty. Jesus was given the most dirty cross which they put on the which they put on the neck of an animal that was full of tetanus. They loved him in there. The devil was very very to kill Jesus at birth but he survived. What is your fear now? &gt;&gt; Can anybody kill you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; your life is the seven seals themselves. Your life is the seven seals themselves. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey my brother. &gt;&gt; Hey, we are seeing God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The seven seals &gt;&gt; are open to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wanted sister to give you the testimony. &gt;&gt; I arrived at the hospital there seeing how many machines were connected to the pastor. Yesterday &gt;&gt; we were dancing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They didn't show you the the picture which we were dancing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I couldn't try. I I couldn't do most other than to cry because &gt;&gt; God is doing miracles. Each and every one of us has got access to these things because the bride tree has been restored. Amen. All the seals have been given back to you. &gt;&gt; The seals are no longer in the Bible. &gt;&gt; You are the seals. Amen. My brother, &gt;&gt; find me where brother says he is those seals. &gt;&gt; Where is Christ today? Where is he? Here. Where are the seals? &gt;&gt; Here are the seals. You are the seals, my brother. Let everybody else be whatever they want to be. &gt;&gt; You are the seals. What the web ate, it has been restored. What the locust ate, &gt;&gt; it has been restored. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything about us, &gt;&gt; the realm, &gt;&gt; the caterpillar, &gt;&gt; it has been restored. &gt;&gt; Is a God of restoration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh you know the the in every country because they always copy what God does in every country there's a state house I don't I don't know where the state house is in South Africa. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For those of you who are lawyers, big lawyers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you should ask, where did where was the president when he was signing this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if he was at his uh lodge or at his farm and he signed a document for you if I was clever enough, I'll tell them that document is useless &gt;&gt; because any document which is very useful. If the if the president is going to send me to death, he has to be on his chair at the state house because that's the only that's the only chair he can use to sign anything which is useful. Those of you who sees Donald Trump, you find every time he's in the off office signing the whatever he signs is nothing, &gt;&gt; he cannot be at his lodge and signing his document. When he wants to do anything, &gt;&gt; yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the opening of the seals &gt;&gt; revealing? Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the opening of the seals? &gt;&gt; What is the opening of the seals? Revealing Christ. Who is revealing Christ at the University of Pritoria? a long dress because everybody else &gt;&gt; he'll be moving around with a tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you are the Christ of Christ. So now when I am the ambassador &gt;&gt; of this another country to this country when I want to speak to the president the president has to be at state house chair at the state house. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When there's a a pardon to be given &gt;&gt; the present has to be where &gt;&gt; at the state house on the so if you can go to the book of kings &gt;&gt; you'll find that the the chair of Solomon &gt;&gt; had how many steps? six steps. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard about that before? [Music] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. If you if you don't understand, just write it down. You're going to read yourself. You are an eagle. I don't need to vomit into your anal. You're going to going to pick yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. I have the scriptures here but uh if I just follow each and every scripture &gt;&gt; can you give me the book of Kings Kings 1 verse we should be I have it somewhere the throne &gt;&gt; 18 yes uh Kings 1 Kings 10:19 &gt;&gt; oh 109 &gt;&gt; you find that the throne The throne had six steps. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many steps were there? &gt;&gt; No. No. Remember remember remember you are the seals. &gt;&gt; How many steps were there? &gt;&gt; Oh yes yes my brother. How many steps are there? &gt;&gt; Seven. But for the seventh one, for you to see it, &gt;&gt; the chair is a step. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, how many steps were there? There were seven. But when it come to the seven, it's always contest. It looks different. The seventh one was looking different. The others were just common. But the seven was different. So there were seven steps because the chair was there. So if the king was going to give any decisions, it has to be on the &gt;&gt; seventh step, not on the sixth step. No, sixth step is for the little people to sit on. First step is for the littlest. If you have to make any decision what we we have to climb how many steps seven once you are in that seven seal then you can say woman who is the owner of the child I am okay bring a sword here let me cut and the people say where This wisdom coming from the chair. You have gone above. &gt;&gt; You cannot make irrational decisions in the seventh seal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is why my brother, my sister, the Bible says I saw one sitting on the throne. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if the ambassador from Malawi had to go and give Mr. Lamapos a letter from Malawi It doesn't it doesn't meet hotel and if if it happens here I I don't know how you do it here when the ambassador from another country comes to state house they have to be first a guard of honor of yeah the ambassador has to inspect a guard of honor &gt;&gt; before he gives the letters to the president because he's as good as the president of that country which he's coming from. So when you come to the book of Esther, even if Esther was a king or as a queen in a modest upper layer to approach the throne, the king had to extend the scepter. What is the scepter for? That's where the power is. Now &gt;&gt; Esther &gt;&gt; Esther &gt;&gt; touched &gt;&gt; a what? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Esther what? &gt;&gt; Esther. &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's let's read. It's in the book of Esther. Esther. It's in the book of Esther. Anybody can hear Esther. &gt;&gt; Esther 5, my brother, verse one. And it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel. &gt;&gt; What is the loyal apparel? The word. She stood in the inner court of the king over against the king's house and he sat on the the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house. Two, it was so when the king saw the queen dressed &gt;&gt; in the yolo upper. He obtained favor in his sight. &gt;&gt; And the king held out to Esther, &gt;&gt; the god and scepter that was in his hand. So Esther come near and touched &gt;&gt; the top uh the the top of the sea. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The power of the king was now with Esther because the power is in the scepter. So the power &gt;&gt; is now with the bride. [Music] &gt;&gt; Climb up those seven seals, my brother. What? Don't Don't mind about the palmer worm, the coner worm, the caterpillar. We have walked through all that. This is time now to be power having power on the throne. And when touch that s &gt;&gt; that's the only time he said king do you know I got enemies so and so and so so the king says what bring them here for judgment. It's only when you can climb all those seven stairs to judge that scepter that you will have power. But you have to go through the caterpillar, the locus, the worm, the worm. Because each and every one of us is an army of God. You are a oneman army. &gt;&gt; My brother, you always underestimate yourself. You have the power. &gt;&gt; Now, how will the judgment of the earth come? When the bride &gt;&gt; comes over to be on the throne. The books were open because one sat on the on the throne. But there's somebody missing on the throne to bring judgment. That's why the the Bible says you &gt;&gt; you are going to judge the world. Because in the book of Esther, who brought judgment on Hammon? You see that? &gt;&gt; You see the the one book. &gt;&gt; Whoever Esther said should be should be raised was raised. You know was given a big seat. Who is that? &gt;&gt; Esther. But it was after she had put on a model up. had gone through all the balorm stage, conqueror stage, all the seven stage upon you. And actually this book is very nice. [Music] Do you know when Hmon was hanged after the feast? When will the judgment come to earth? after the millennium. &gt;&gt; Millennium. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It is the feast which will be telling God those troubled us so much come back very angry. Bring all of them here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the seals are open. But those seals it is you yourself. &gt;&gt; So if the seals are open to you, start listening to other people. Tell God to speak to you yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If someone tells you if my brother if someone will tell you that I I am bad don't argue with him you go to God and ask him to him he was telling me that brother head is bad &gt;&gt; is he bad if God doesn't tell you that &gt;&gt; forget about it. [Music] &gt;&gt; God does not heed his secrets &gt;&gt; to his prophets. &gt;&gt; The king cannot hide his secrets to the queen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the message of the hour has come, &gt;&gt; we are supposed to feast all of us on the message. You yourself, &gt;&gt; whatever I've spoken about here, &gt;&gt; you yourself go and start picking it in the message of because you are an eagle. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't just take what somebody has already eaten. You are an eagle. And my brother, my sister, this ego bel. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. We go up, &gt;&gt; we go higher. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the pastor will be coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are going higher. &gt;&gt; We're not going down. &gt;&gt; No. No. Uh my brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; uh I should tell you one thing. &gt;&gt; You are a very special person. &gt;&gt; Each and everyone of you. [Music] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if we were to see Jesus today, we will have to come to you. You are an Esther. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; you are an Esther. &gt;&gt; You have touched the scepter. &gt;&gt; The power which is in heaven &gt;&gt; is now upon you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the saints &gt;&gt; When the sins Go marching in. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Even the angels will keep quiet. &gt;&gt; Angels are messengers. &gt;&gt; But this one is the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when everything is all done, all the songs have been sung, when we come to this throne, that's when we judge the world. God bless you. Amen. Amen. I I had a very nice song which I want to sing but now I forgotten because there been just too much here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will wait for the singers to be around. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's say sing be of good courage.
