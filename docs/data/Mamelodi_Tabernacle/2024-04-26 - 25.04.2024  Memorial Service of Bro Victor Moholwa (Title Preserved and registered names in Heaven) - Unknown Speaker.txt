Description:
Memorial Service of Bro Victor Moholwa
Title: The preserved and registered names in heaven.
Preached by Elder Peter Skosana at Soshanguve on 25 April 2024

The elder read the following scriptures:

1 Corinthians 15: 45-51 | Luke 10: 20 | Ephesians 1: 17 | Matthew 25:10 &34 | Jude 1: 4 | John 17: 1 | John 8: 37 | Matthew 22: 41-46 |

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the names which are preserved and registered in heaven.

What we call death here on earth is just a departure of that person. The departure is that the soul took its direction, the spirit took its direction and the body. This flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven.

When Jesus came on earth it was not to show off himself, but it was to reveal the word. The word must be incarnated in the human being, and it will give that person life.

You must have the knowledge of Him and there must be a spirit that should give you that knowledge. When a person departs, we should not worry. You should know where you come from and where you are going. We are waiting for the rapture, and you know that you must have the rapturing faith.

The registered names were chosen in him before the foundation of the world, and you cannot change that. You cannot make yourself holy, it is Him that predestinated you.

You have to overcome and not by yourself, but you were predestinated to overcome. 

If your name is registered and preserved in heaven you cannot miss the direction. My sheep hear my voice, and they follow me.

Your kingdom was prepared for you before the foundation of the world.

When a person feels a physical pain we give them medication, but a spiritual pain needs a spiritual remedy. We go straight to the spirit and feed their soul with the word. 

When the word finds a place in the people it germinates and becomes Christ in you. There is a physical son of God and there's a supernatural son of God, which is the Logos. There is the natural son of God but the revelation of the word ...

departed and then we just come together and then read the word and remind each other and then we read the word that is relevant with what has happened so as to console the the the family and the church at large and those who were used to him okay let me start by saying yes was our friend was a Believer as for myself I know him while he was still very young I used to pick him up section F take him to the service every SU until he got married and have children too but as brother says he has been very courageous in fighting this is the first man that led the team uh to fight against these evil spirits he will take them to the rivers to cut off the connections those that have got connections to the Demonic world now he'll go to the place where they were initiated cut off that connection and there was quite a number of them amen and there's quite a number of people that were were helped you know all brothers and sisters from so we're going to read the word uh and here and say some few uh uh words concerning the scriptures that we have read I would like us to read from the book of First Corinthians chapter 15 uh we'll start from verse 45 First Corinthians chapter 15 15 starting from verse 45 45 and then up to 511 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how be that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven as it is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit in corruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed okay let's just bow our head we have our just to pray for the reading of the [Applause] word as we bow our head gracious Eternal Heavenly Father the almighty God Lord the great even tonight we are gathered for the memorial of our brother and our Elder that Mo and we believe that the word that has been read is ready for a purpose to confort the family to confort all the Beloved for the Bible is the only book that has ever been written that can tell us about where we come from amen Lord where we are going where we are going to spend it eternity our Elder is standing in front of us anointed of the Holy Ghost to speak to us Lord God Almighty it is our prayer that you anoint each and everyone that is in here for the Holy Ghost to flow and for all of us to hear the word we know the evil one always triy to take chances there was a time when the prophet of God was preaching an unbeliever was sent to challenge the preacher with the intention to hypnotize him to make him back like a dog but the man of God CAU that spirit and even so where that Spirit was hanging amen and he announced it to the church the man was paralyzed and carried out that is a warning to those that H spells while a man of God stand on the pull pit amen for this place is an anointed place is a holy Place Satan we command you to live right now you stand no chance as we commit this service unto the hand of the Lord the Almighty God for we believe that the way that will proceed here shall not return unto us void but it will accomplish that which is will please God father God we commit everything unto thee in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen or you may be seated yeah we have read the word especially where the Bible says the first Adam was it speak speak about the first Adam and the second Adam but before I go there I would like to compare what I've been reading what what we have read with Luke chapter 10 Luke 10 we can start reading from verse 20 or can we can read only verse 20 and compare these two Luke chap 10 we read verse 20 not not withstanding in the this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven yeah now what happened here our Lord Jesus Christ gave his disciples power to go and fight the evil spirits they did fight the evil spirit the the disciples did fight the evil spirit and defeated them and they came back to him very happy so now he said to them uh not withstanding in this Rejoice Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in [Applause] heaven so my title will be uh uh the preserved and uh registered names in [Applause] heaven because here what he says it says your name are written in heaven now if the names are written in heaven then they are preserved in heaven and then they are registered in heaven so now death is not is nothing compared to that because once your name is [Applause] reserved and is registered nobody can do any work okay what we call death here on on this planet [Applause] Earth is just the departure of an individual is that we uh we had that ignorance we had that ignorance that when somebody has passed on we think that that somebody is dead but actually it's not dead it's just a departure the soul took its own Direction the spirit took its own Direction and the body took its own Direction we know very well that all of us are going to soal die but actually it's just a departure and the Bible says this Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God now the prophet says you know one day Pastor Mak said said why when we meet we've got when we have funerals why don't we preach like we preach every Sunday he says now if there is a funeral of the Catholics they do their Catholic thing if there's a funeral of the zc they will spray you with water you came to their F but we message Believers we sort of uh take up okay fine so now I will preach the way I preach every Sunday now I will read a certain portion where the Prophet says only those that are written in the Lamb's Book of Life by being redeemed right because the Bible says except a man be born again he will not enter into a kingdom now he says only those who are in the Lamb's Book of Life by being redeemed when when Jesus Christ uh came here on Earth he was not coming to show off himself he was here to reveal the [Applause] we now the revelation of the we was that people must receive that we and when they receive that weight they receive life because the Bible says who he who finds me find life now now what is happening is that now the word must be incarnated into a human being and then that word itself then gives that person life in in John 17 yeah remember here he says don't be happy because the demons runs away from you but what is important is that you must Rejoice because your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life After the resurrection he went up and then when he went up and then he sent the spirit down and then the spirit down he redeemed Us by that blood and the spirit remember one day he said he took a bread and gave his disciples at each This Is My Flesh and and then took wine and gave them and say itat this is my blood drink this is my blood so they ate his flesh and drank his blood but he never explained that now his flesh or bread it means the we the spirit means the blood I mean the the wine means the blood are we together so now he cleans his church by his blood now when he cleans his blood by his I mean his church by his blood the word that is preached it becomes too difficult for a human [Applause] mind it must go to a human heart and then there should be a spirit that come and interpret that word like in the book of First Corinthians I mean first uh I mean Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesians chapter 1 if you read verse 17 verse 17 yes verse 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him see this he must give unto you the spirit of wisdom [Applause] and Revelation in the knowledge of him there's a spirit that will give you [Music] wisdom and the Revelation in the knowledge of him in other words you must have a knowledge of him but not through your mind there's a spirit that must give you that revelation together now let's go back now we are talking about the preserved and registered names in heaven if somebody depart we don't have to worry that the only worry that can come that we're used to him it it become difficult to accept his departure but as far as you know you need to know where you come from and where you are and where you are going you don't just leave you always look back where you come from and then see where you are then if you call compare from where you come from to where you are you will see that there's Grace God was merciful to you because where you come from you didn't know him and where you are now you know him and then that gives you now the forecast you know exactly where you are going you are you are waiting for the Rapture and while you waiting for the Rapture you know that now you need to have a rapturing faith right and you know how to have that rapturing Faith now when you look at back where you come from and and when you are here now I'm very happy because you have the Revelation and there are people who doesn't see what you see who haven't heard what we are hearing every Sunday are we together so now that is why he says now only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life by being redeemed right then in Revelation 20 I'll just quote these Scriptures it says and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of [Applause] Fire now that that tells you about the future now you know where you are and the Bible tells you that whosoever was not found written in that book then will be cast into the lake of fire then you know that now if you are not if you read Ephesians 1 verse 4 you know that the pastor always read that he says according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now now the preserved and registered names in heaven have been chosen in him before the foundation of the world you you won't change that it's it's it's a predestination it's according as he has chosen Us in in himself before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him now that thing you cannot make yourself holy it's him who has predestinated you now he has oberved and registered your name in heaven now now every Sunday the pastor reads this scripture in Revelation 2 R you know that verse 17 that he who overcomes now in other words you need to overcome then he said I will give him a h hidden man not just an ordinary man a hidden man now because you are preserved that Mana is preserved only for you and then you have to overcome not by yourself you are predestinated as an overcome right and then verse five he said having predestinated us unto the adoption of of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now let us understand that he says he do things he God do things according to his good [Applause] pleasure now he do things according his good pleasure and then what are those things he predestinated us now and he has chosen Us in himself now that that is why now we worship God we worship God because he himself has called us you know that scripture said he he he that he knew then he called them then he that has called them he predestinated them to a preserved life to a preserved and registered names in heaven [Applause] the pastor taught us about the citizens of Heaven now the citizens of heaven will start the citizenship here on [Applause] Earth are we together Abraham started his citizenship here on Earth and the bride his citizensh her citizenship here on Earth you remember about Revelation chapter 5 he says he took the book that is the book of redemption now that book of redemption our names are written in that book then if our names are written in what happened after he was through with the seven Church ages then he came down with the book and then he's calling people by the names that are written on that book are we together he has finished his job now he's he's having a book now he's calling people according to their preserved preserved and registered names which are in heaven so now if your name is preserved and registered in heaven there's no way that you'll miss it you you won't miss a Direction amen he said my sheep hear my voice and when they hear my voice what will they do they will follow me they will follow me so you follow him because you hear his voice right let me give you another example there's a time where our Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew chapter 25 he spoke about the wise and the foolish virgin you know about that but I'm going to read only two verses there in verse 10 25 he says it says and while they went to buy [Applause] the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the [Applause] marriage and the doors were shut was shut you know about the 10 foolish virgin five were wise five were finish they they were waiting for uh the the bridegroom then he says when the bridegroom comes those that don't have oil went to byy while they were out the bridegroom came that they were ready they went in with him in the marriage and the door is shut then shall the king say unto them in verse 34 on the right now is the Judgment Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world you see I said my my my my title is the preserved and registered names in heaven now he will say Come Ye blessed of my father now he says now inherit the Kingdom that was prepared for you when before from the foundation of the world now your kingdom was prepared for you before the foundation of the world and there's no way that you will miss the the citizenship of the are we together am and in verse 41 more verse 41 and and he shall say unto them on the left hand depart from me you cast into the Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels while we are worshiping we are a that there are those that will take a different direction uh if you can read with me in in Jude in the book of of Jude read I'll read only uh verse four now you see youve got two types there are those that their uh names are not preserved in heaven and you say you hear what he says he says depart from me ye cast he say they cast they are cast into Everlasting fire and the the other ones he said they are blessed of the father they inherit the Kingdom that was prepared for for from the foundation of the world right now if you go to Jude in verse 4 verse it says for there are certain men crept in Una a who were before old ordained to this condemnation you hear what it says it says they are ordained for this condemnation now you can you you might ask me a question and saying okay what what has that to do with the funeral and what has it got to do with a memorial service now I said when we started here that a memorial service has to do is to do to do with the Departed one now what we are reading here is what he used to hear now we are reading this in his memory because we used to Fellowship about these things he used to sit down and these things were were preached he knew that the is a bride and there is a church he knew that there is a a predestinated seat there is a cast people he knew that there are those who are ordained for condemnation there are those who are predestinated for a life if you go to verse six it says and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he had reserved in Everlasting chains under Darkness unto the judge M of the great [Music] day are we still together what I'm trying to show you is that now you won't miss it if your name is preserved and if your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life so when you depart we will have a natural pain natural pain but the Comfort it should be the spiritual one I always say when somebody has lost the one that h he he or she she [Music] loved the only way of comforting that individual is to go to the Bible and and and check the promises of God but the natural part you can't you can't you can't uh what do we say if somebody feels the pain it's not the natural pain like somebody who is [Music] injured if somebody feels a natural pain you'll give him tablets or injection or you bandage but now the spiritual pain need a spiritual bondage and the spiritual bondage it's a supernatural you go right to where his soul is and feed that soul with the truth look you got a soul a body and Body Soul and Spirit once once the soul gets the truth and then that's the the the the greatest bondage ever because that's where you are that's that's who you are are are we together yeah because the prophet says the bride is himself revealed see so we're talking about those that uh uh took the wrong direction and those that took the right direction and then he says the rest was left for tribulation period whipping and wailing and nashing of and then he says that's the church not the bride let me tell you what's the difference between the church and the bride our Lord Jesus Christ came the were first phes they were SES and they were they were scribes now the S thees did not believe in the resurrection no they were they did not believe in the resurrection they say when you are dead we are dead you see and then that does those Paul called them uh fools the scripture that we just read in in in in in in First Corinthian Paul says when you when you plant a seed that seed must die so that it could give life so says now you fools you don't have an understanding okay fine what he's trying to say is that now there should be a seed in you the seed which is the weed in you and that seed uh must spare of its [Music] own let me read it so that you could understand it uh let's read John 17 I mean John 17 yes John chapter 17 the difference uh uh between the the bride and the church uh brother okay chapter 17 verse1 it these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee right now glorify he says now father the hour has come to glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee now our Lord Jesus Christ was here on Earth so that the words that he speak should find a place you remember in John 8 verse 37 he says you say you he says John 8:37 you don't have to read it uh he says you want to kill me but you say you are the Seed of Abraham of okay says you want to kill me and yet you say you are defeated it is because my weight could not find a place in your heart see now he he he was bringing the word to the people and once that word get a place in the heart of the people then that we germinate and then when it germinate it becomes Christ now the difference now between the church and the bride the church enjoy the weed are we together but that we cannot germinate and bring the I mean and germinate and be their owner because when the word germinate it makes Christ in you and when the word makes Christ in you then you become Christ you see amen now when when he says glorify me he was saying the words that I preached let it be manifested into the people so that when you speak about me he speaks about the word remember there is the physical son of God which was Jesus and there is a supernatural Son of God which is logos logos is the Son of God Jesus is the son of God you this this is Harvest he's a physical Son of God but the Revelation that is in him is also the Son of God are we together amen now Jesus wanted that now look look if as he continues verse two says as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him so his weight when it reaches you then it the word comes from eternity in the beginning was the word the word was the word was with God the Word was God now when it comes to you it brings eternity it brings the Eternal beam it and it forms the Eternal being now it makes you the Eternal being not this flesh no it bring it goes to your heart and then when it gets into your heart that word itself like when when the prophet says the word is now in the bright it means then then that word which is in the bride makes that person an amateure God are we together amen now if it makes you an amateur God then it gives you a revelation and then when it gives you a revelation he says now H you'll know what to do with that re now our Lord Jesus Christ wanted that people should know the word that is why if you go to uh to the day he was speaking to Peter he said to Peter uh before I me he started by saying to all who do people say that the son of is you see he want just them to to to to to to have a revelation of who he was not not really Jesus but the word itself are we together that's why he when he said thou are the Christ Christ and logos and the spirit it's one and the same thing Christ is logos logos is the pillar of fire logos is still the word so when he says Thou Art Christ then he was saying this was logos this was Pillar of Fire and then it was a revelation to Peter and then if if it was a revelation to Peter uh then he finished that's why he says now glorify me my last scripture my last scripture is here in the Book of Matthew uh Matthew chapter 22 from verse 41 he says while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of David I'm sure you are aware that he says what think ye of Christ he doesn't say what think ye of Jesus says what think he of Christ now he was asking the Pharisees and then he said whose son was he is he and then they said he the son of David then he said unto them how then that David in spirit call him Lord saying the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy foot St if David then call him Lord how is he his son verse 46 and no man was able to answer him now this question is the very same question that he asked his disciples is the very same question so now the consolation to the moers is that your your the things that we preach here your father engaged them and when you engage them then that gives you a supernatural encouragement that there is a citizen of New Jerusalem if there's a citizen of New Jerusalem according to the predestination we will meet there and the Bible also says uh the all those that slept they will they will rise and then we will see them and then our bodies will change now this ministry that you are having the ministry of the revelation of the seventh seal which is the power of the third pool gives you uh it inspires you as his as his children that's where you get the the rapturing Fai the Bible the Bible speaks about uh in Romans chapter 8 verse 19 it speaks about the manifestations of the sons of God now the revelation of the seven SE shows the manifestations of the sons of God and then that is the consolation we we don't have to worry home is sweet home we are going home all of us if if he teres of which we know right now the time and the signs are telling everything is telling and the word also is telling there's nothing Beyond this there's nothing Beyond this ministry we cannot say we're waiting another Revelation there's no other Revelation the Revelation is that of the seventh seity beyond that is a Rapture God bless you God bless you uh thank you uh I will call upon our Elder T to come and take over God bless you thank you for ah thanks
