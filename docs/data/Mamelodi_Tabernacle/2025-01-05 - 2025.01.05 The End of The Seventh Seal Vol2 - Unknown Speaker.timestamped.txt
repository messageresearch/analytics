[1:23:59] soul is not the
[1:24:03] same you see this body I can take a
[1:24:11] soul and so it's very
[1:24:16] painful but the torment of the Soul you
[1:24:18] cannot describe
[1:24:22] it the only
[1:24:25] description is that you go and and taste
[1:24:29] it you go and taste
[1:24:34] it that is
[1:24:36] why I will never leave the
[1:24:42] weight
[1:24:44] because I know what the bottomless pit
[1:24:52] is and I know
[1:24:56] what the torment
[1:25:01] is this
[1:25:03] people who are playing
[1:25:06] about playing around it's because they
[1:25:10] don't
[1:25:14] know
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:17] okay you must make my
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:21] way so I was crying for falling
[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:25:27] crying
[1:25:30] tormented never hits the
[1:25:34] ground so the torment
[1:25:37] is you are about to wake
[1:25:41] up but you can't wake up we are about to
[1:25:45] hit the
[1:25:46] ground but you can't hit the
[1:25:48] ground there's an
[1:25:51] unexplainable pain
[1:25:56] so I was saying but what have I
[1:26:02] done and then the voice said do you know
[1:26:05] where you
[1:26:07] are he said no I don't know where and
[1:26:10] when that voice
[1:26:13] speaks the tment
[1:26:17] stops so the voice said that is the
[1:26:20] bottom of spe
[1:26:24] that is the punishment you are getting
[1:26:26] you're still going to be
[1:26:33] judged I said but I haven't done
[1:26:36] anything he said no you
[1:26:39] rejected the word of the
[1:26:42] [Music]
[1:26:44] Lord said I never rejected the word of
[1:26:47] the
[1:26:48] Lord nobody has ever come to me about
[1:26:52] the and scene

[1:49:36] you
[1:49:41] sir you know they say that you cannot be
[1:49:43] two places at the same
[1:49:47] time but I don't know if I can agree
[1:49:50] with that entirely
[1:49:53] because my heart and soul is in
[1:49:58] Africa but I have to take but I have to
[1:50:01] take my body and I have to go back to
[1:50:03] the United
[1:50:04] States because that's where I live
[1:50:07] that's where I work and that's where my
[1:50:11] uh obligations in life

[1:50:18] heart and soul is with you
[1:50:21] here we are a long ways apart in
[1:50:24] distance but we are not a long ways
[1:50:26] apart in heart
[1:50:29] amen I think I thank the Lord that he
[1:50:32] has made a way for our paths to
[1:50:35] cross and uh I know I know that it's God
[1:50:39] that has done this and I will always be
[1:50:42] grateful for
[1:50:45] that so I just appreciate the time I
[1:50:48] have been able to
[1:50:51] spend I I so grateful that I could be in
[1:50:55] the conference with you all as
[1:50:59] well there's just one brief thing I was
[1:51:02] going to
[1:51:03] share because it stood out to me let me
[1:51:06] see if I can get my
[1:51:20] folder when I was in the meeting for the
[1:51:25] conference the last morning I was
[1:51:29] sitting in the dining
[1:51:31] area at
[1:51:34] the and as I was sitting there I was
[1:51:37] thinking you know I really love my
[1:51:40] brothers and sisters here in this
[1:51:42] country they're dear to my
[1:51:45] heart and I thought you know I said I
[1:51:48] put them
[1:51:50] here and I and I put myself down
[1:51:55] here I said but when I get around
[1:51:59] them they put me here and themselves
[1:52:03] down
[1:52:05] here so as I was thinking about
[1:52:08] this there was a certain scripture that
[1:52:11] came to my mind and I wanted to share
[1:52:14] that that scripture is in Philippians
[1:52:17] chapter
[1:52:19] 2 and it's verse three verse
[1:52:23] so I'm going to read
[1:52:25] that let nothing be done through Strife
[1:52:30] or vain
[1:52:32] Glory but in liness of
[1:52:36] Mind Let each esteem other better than
[1:52:45] themselves I think if everybody had that
[1:52:48] kind of an attitude we wouldn't have
[1:52:51] near the kind of problems
[1:52:52] I know you understand what it means to
[1:52:58] close amen amen to keep it closed in
[1:53:08] you as the time when allow
[1:53:14] me now while
[1:53:18] standing after this we are just going to
[1:53:21] read to say a
[1:53:26] prayer and dismiss the
[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:32] church that we we were supposed to
[1:53:36] preach we still going to
[1:53:40] preach but I just want to read this
[1:53:44] part I
[1:53:46] think there at the
[1:53:49] conference we have read the same thing
[1:53:53] the
[1:53:55] revelation of what that
[1:54:01] was
[1:54:02] amen I can't say sit because I just read
[1:54:06] for to
[1:54:10] pray the
[1:54:12] revelation of what that
[1:54:18] was I wonder if you understood that
[1:54:28] [Music]
[1:54:30] there nothing new with
[1:54:34] us what we
[1:54:36] have is the
[1:54:39] revelation of what that
[1:54:45] wasen and it is here
[1:54:49] today because it was not a revelation
[1:54:55] there now because
[1:54:57] today we are here in our
[1:55:02] bodies now it's a
[1:55:04] revelation to
[1:55:06] us of what that
[1:55:12] was I just read to
[1:55:15] you everything that we are
[1:55:20] receiving everything that we hear
[1:55:24] here is the
[1:55:27] revelation of what that
[1:55:33] was because I was I'm not I'm not

[2:04:12] something there but we are coming to
[2:04:16] read it says I
[2:04:20] wondered about
[2:04:23] the when I look at the
[2:04:26] seals there's something
[2:04:30] here what God did about the
[2:04:35] world he
[2:04:36] worked I I think last time I read the
[2:04:40] same
[2:04:42] thing it was in his
[2:04:46] mind if you
[2:04:48] notice it come like
[2:04:53] Revolution like he
[2:04:57] was learning all the
[2:05:00] time making something
[2:05:03] greater
[2:05:05] greater he was above it
[2:05:11] all and just let it
[2:05:16] evolute up to
[2:05:20] that you see
[2:05:24] and everything he began to bring upon
[2:05:28] the
[2:05:31] Earth from B
[2:05:34] life you still remember
[2:05:37] the and fish
[2:05:39] and so
[2:05:42] forth and uh
[2:05:45] beds
[2:05:47] animals and then
[2:05:50] something in his own
[2:05:53] image forgive me
[2:05:55] for wiping and wiping
[2:05:59] like uh a man and
[2:06:03] stopped
[2:06:07] there
[2:06:09] why because it was up to his
[2:06:17] Perfection you remember he said let us
[2:06:21] make
[2:06:22] men in
[2:06:27] our now
[2:06:29] today if he
[2:06:31] comes doing his
[2:06:35] rounds and he
[2:06:38] arve at a
[2:06:40] man who is like
[2:06:43] him
[2:06:46] stop amen that's
[2:06:49] why Revelation tell s
[2:07:06] say you can find it Revelation
[2:07:10] 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the
[2:07:13] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[2:07:16] sound the mystery of God shall be
[2:07:18] finished as he ha declared to his
[2:07:21] servants the prophets right amen now the
[2:07:24] last
[2:07:26] one did I say Revelation
[2:07:29] yes okay now find this scripture for
[2:07:34] me I know the
[2:07:37] scripture where it
[2:07:41] says
[2:07:43] but I I want that part
[2:07:48] brother when he open he stopped
[2:07:52] okay then there's a scripture again
[2:07:55] Revelation 81 where he
[2:07:58] [Music]
[2:07:59] stopped and when he had opened the
[2:08:02] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[2:08:04] about the space of half an
[2:08:11] hour all right yes
[2:08:22] okay amen now before we we we we we
[2:08:28] closed
[2:08:30] uh after this did did God stop somewhere
[2:08:35] else yes in
[2:08:37] Genesis yeah in Genesis he stopped I am
[2:08:42] after when he made man after he made men
[2:08:46] yes but not just a man is is
[2:08:52] men in
[2:08:55] his meaning God stopped at his
[2:09:02] image
[2:09:05] amen there
[2:09:07] somewhere elsewhere he
[2:09:10] stopped the scripture the scripture
[2:09:14] didn't
[2:09:16] continue the scripture he didn't
[2:09:19] continue
[2:09:22] you find those places in the
[2:09:26] Bible
[2:09:28] amen the
[2:09:30] seventh he
[2:09:32] stopped why he
[2:09:36] stopped
[2:09:39] course
[2:09:41] image Something In His
[2:09:46] Image brother Bram puts it to
[2:09:50] me then
[2:09:53] he stopped
[2:09:57] am
[2:09:58] amen here's the
[2:10:02] scripture say sister here's the
[2:10:06] scripture where
[2:10:11] again he never said anything further and
[2:10:16] where he opened the SC and he found a
[2:10:18] place closed it
[2:10:21] when he he found a place yes and then he
[2:10:24] says this day the scripture is fulfilled
[2:10:27] before and closed and stopped all right
[2:10:31] amen now every time he comes to
[2:10:35] seven now there's another
[2:10:38] scripture he came to
[2:10:41] seven and he didn't go
[2:10:46] further say it sister don't fear
[2:10:54] Genesis Genesis
[2:10:56] 2:2
[2:11:00] okay and on the seventh day God ended
[2:11:03] his work which he had made and he rested
[2:11:06] on the work which he had made and he
[2:11:09] rested on the seventh day from all his
[2:11:11] work which he had
[2:11:13] made what happened
[2:11:17] after where uh where the Bible says
[2:11:22] let us make men in our
[2:11:28] image and after
[2:11:32] that Genesis 1 ver 26 then yes and God
[2:11:38] said let us make men in our image after
[2:11:41] our likeness and let them have dominion
[2:11:43] over the fish of the sea and over the
[2:11:46] foul of the air and over the cattle and
[2:11:48] over all the Earth and over every
[2:11:51] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[2:11:53] Earth so God created men in his own
[2:11:56] image in the image of God created he him
[2:12:00] male and female created he them okay
[2:12:03] we'll come and look for for
[2:12:06] some
[2:12:09] because in his
[2:12:13] rounds the
[2:12:15] Bible when he arrived at the seven
[2:12:23] stops because he made
[2:12:26] man in his own
[2:12:29] image every time when he AR at
[2:12:36] his amen that's why the people don't see
[2:12:41] the revelation of the seven where do you
[2:12:45] read
[2:12:48] that Revelation 8 ver1
[2:12:52] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[2:12:55] there was silence in heaven about the
[2:12:58] space of half an
[2:13:00] hour meaning he
[2:13:03] stopped for
[2:13:06] [Music]
[2:13:07] about why because every time he arrives
[2:13:12] at his
[2:13:14] Ownage he
[2:13:18] stops now the last thing I I will I will
[2:13:23] close these
[2:13:25] books
[2:13:27] amen man is
[2:13:30] his
[2:13:33] and
[2:13:36] stopped why why he doesn't go
[2:13:43] further because he has
[2:13:46] made men in his
[2:13:53] amen that's why
[2:13:57] today we are preaching the
[2:14:00] message let me read you the
[2:14:05] last
[2:14:07] um the church only came into view
[2:14:15] once each Nation the
[2:14:18] church but the bread
[2:14:22] in
[2:14:24] twice see what it
[2:14:28] was not knowing it but look at it with
[2:14:33] my message this
[2:14:35] morning the seed
[2:14:38] fell in the
[2:14:41] ground
[2:14:44] at that was original seat
[2:14:51] and she come through the process of
[2:14:54] these
[2:15:00] denominations uh which only com in
[2:15:05] existence
[2:15:07] [Music]
[2:15:11] once well we are starting another
[2:15:15] something that we are going to
[2:15:18] continue amen amen you see if you look
[2:15:22] around you look
[2:15:25] around nothing is

[2:15:54] on but the bride
[2:15:58] returns back
[2:15:59] again in the last
[2:16:02] days so that's why we are not new
[2:16:07] people we have come
[2:16:10] again in the last
[2:16:14] days because the Lord said I
[2:16:18] will restore
[2:16:22] H I'm going to read something to the
[2:16:25] people who would
