whatever you do in words in do them in the name of the Lord Jesus but there is a problem people don't know how to do things in his name to do something in the name of somebody is either you are his son because if you are his son you are doing in his name or you are his wife and if you are his wife you do it in his name in other words whatever I'm going to do here I'm going to do them in his name because I am his son and I am I'm his bride I can't do anything if it is not in his name [Music] I'm I'm happy to have uh Pastor George here he's my friend one day I said I'm not going to preach I'm

[Music] how and you for see [Music] [Applause] [Music] your be your [Music] [Music] [Music] oh can you hear Pastor M to [Music] pray bow our heads and pray gracious Heavenly Father we dream it as a great privilege once again this morning morning that you have given us a gift of life life is yours it's an investment one day you are going to ask us to give an account on what we did with that life which you given to us that's why every day we want to align up with your word so that our lives should be acceptable before thee these young people here are coming before thee to align up with the word so the day which they will give an account they should give an correct account of what a wedding should be be with us father be with the ministering uh Pastor here let let the Holy Ghost just take control let the same make who visited Abraham in the tent there be here today to visit these young people as I'm committing the whole service here into thine holy hands in Jesus Christ name I pray magnifying and glorifying your holy name amen and amen before you sit down let me ask my brother to read the scripture here umth chapter 19 19 he must just read read verse six only in English wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God has joined together let no man put a son I you allowing you to sit down who can I ask that allowing this lady to be married by this young you must tell me your name and your [Music] relationship God bless you [Music] I tell me your name and your [Music] [Applause] relationship when you take your seats when you take your it means you are out you are out in the in the Tomb we don't want to hear you mingling with their things my mother said my father said now see down now the one who is remaining is the pastor amen the apparent now is the pastor if they got a problem they must go to the pastor not to the apparent the apparent have said they must see them now they are left with me here I'm the pastor the B uh my brother and my sister I'm going to join you in this holy matrimony the Bible says here whatever God has Str together no man should put them as no magistrate no pastor should put them as no man you see when God puts things together here on Earth just like now you are here God is going to join you together when he joins you together today it means he he had joined you together that before the foundation of the world because he says here he that made them in the beginning he made them male and female while you are in a spirit real God Made You male and female and When God Made You male and female you were in His image [Music] and the image of God is male and female if if there is no male the image is not complete if there is no female the female is not complete that's why Jesus Christ after God has restored Adam he had to restore Eve and he rest Eve during seven Church he was restoring his wife until at the end now we at the end of the seven Church age because every messenger comes at the end of the age in other words our messenger here has come at the End of the Age We Are No More in L we are above l physically I can say I I am in but spiritually I am out of God has done his work he has restored that's why when we 10 we see him coming with the book open why because he's bringing the the marriage certificate because the marriage has been done here that he spre the now I can say here we are married we are the people who qualifies to join people together because it's not me training people it's God who's training them because he says if they accept you they accept me if they reject you they reject me if you reject the one who who sent you reject him I am the one who sent I am the pastor here [Music] [Music] what God has TR together God said telling job where were you job when the sons of God were shouting when I was laying the foundation you were there shouting you were there shouting in a sister and brother Sons and Daughters of God they shouting if you are the child of God now it means you were the child of God then if you not the child of God then you will never be the child of God [Music] here but there is a problem a sister can you see a brother he thinks a Son of God but only to find it is not the of God is From Below because always where the children of God meet Satan comes there also then when you see somebody singing cores you think he the child of God but he from Below thinking is a child of God when he propose you you accept his proposition but you accept the proposition from someone from below and that marriage will never be successful but the marriage from God because if you are from God you have got the nature of God because you are a son if you are a son of God the nature of your father God is the weight if you are if you are the Son of God it means you are part of the weight you are the weight you are the weight manifested in flesh now here but you must you must be sure Satan is going to test your un he's going to test you be sure of that Satan is going to test your un God is at your side you always conquer him if you follow the right channel you always conquer him if you don't follow the right chel he will he will destroy your your [Music] marriage brother um say name what your name here oh my brother I thought you are married you still singing oh thank you um sister God bless you um you are you are at the brid now you are going to cross I'm going to let you cross over this [Music] bridge are you listen but the bridge I'm going to let you cross you must know you must never come [Music] back if you try to come back through this is going to be destroyed and is going to destroy your life to stay safe don't try to go back through this I'm going to let you cross you are no more going to be a single [Music] man because I take you from a single man to the married man you must know that you must say bye-bye what advice can they give you because they are not married why they what did they know about marriage now I'm going to cross I'm going to let you cross you must never go back there I'm going to take you through that [Music] from the Bible says the one who created them he created M and and called their Nam the day they were created the day you created God called you the day you were created but by birth you were born at [Music] food but don't belong [Music] there by birth you are but you don't belong there you are a son of God when we call you m it's just it's just it's just to associate you with [Music] this but you are not [Music] M there is no there there there's no P there there's no Dev there don't have such we have got children of God finish [Music] and now this bridge when you cross it there was a man who was making a Bells [Music] um he make one B he was doing many Bells when he made another one then somebody bought it when he start ringing it it is the correct sound but when it goes on the sound started to change he take it back he said well there is a crack they try to patch the crack they try to patch it or some days it will ring give the correct sound but when it goes on will develop they try to P it the Craig will develop they try to P but what they should have done taken the bell and throw it into the pot so that it can melt they dear beloved we have GED here in the face of this company in the presence of God join together in holy this man this woman which
