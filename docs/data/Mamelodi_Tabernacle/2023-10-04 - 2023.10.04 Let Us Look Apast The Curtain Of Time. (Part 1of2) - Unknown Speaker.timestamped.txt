[5:28] reading of the word
[5:33] and uh we'll take
[5:37] from the
[5:41] prophet
[5:42] amen you know as we said the prophet is
[5:46] a
[5:50] messenger he brings the message to the
[5:56] people amen amen now
[6:00] not only to for us to
[6:11] [Music]
[6:15] Pro okay
[6:18] now the
[6:20] seventh
[6:22] SE the Bible
[6:25] says
[6:28] silent amen amen and that's what brother
[6:35] says it confused the
[6:42] enemy because Satan is lost
[6:50] them Satan will always operate after God
[6:55] have done
[6:58] something
[7:02] Satan is just an
[7:05] [Music]
[7:08] impersonator unless God say something
[7:11] Satan has got nothing to
[7:16] say he will
[7:19] wait until God says don't eat from this
[7:26] tree then Satan hear that thing
[7:31] then he comes and
[7:33] say and gives you
[7:36] an inter to you what
[7:44] God but if God can put a tree there and
[7:48] keep quiet Satan has got nothing to
[7:57] say that's why
[8:01] seal is
[8:04] quiet now Satan has got nothing to
[8:09] say
[8:10] amen and
[8:14] now look into this for a few
[8:19] minutes and firstly firstly when the L
[8:25] took the
[8:27] [Music]
[8:28] book
[8:30] he came down with the
[8:34] book amen am and he he never said
[8:39] anything he came
[8:42] down with the
[8:44] book but to the seventh
[8:50] messenger you know even if you read back
[8:53] in the Book of
[8:57] Genesis uh you you you look
[9:04] at was it the seven
[9:07] [Music]
[9:13] man and God
[9:16] says walked with
[9:20] God because he is the seventh men
[9:27] from and he erected the
[9:32] pyramid he build the
[9:37] pyamid
[9:39] and even the scientist of
[9:43] today cannot interpret the
[9:48] pyramid the seven steps inside to the
[9:51] king's
[9:53] chamber the seven
[9:57] steps inside the pyramid
[10:01] going to the king's
[10:03] [Music]
[10:06] chamber ited the bride the
[10:12] church because the bride the church is
[10:15] seven
[10:18] steps to
[10:20] God now it is
[10:24] en Enoch made that structure that is
[10:29] brother says that is the sign
[10:33] left pyramid pyramid is the sign of
[10:39] En the
[10:43] seven and was only interpreted by the
[10:46] seventh angel
[10:48] [Music]
[10:52] messenger it is brother who now
[10:55] interpreted the
[10:58] pyramid
[10:59] because he is the seventh angel
[11:02] [Music]
[11:06] messenger and was the seven
[11:13] man so you must find
[11:18] your now we have two books
[11:23] here H in one
[11:26] book and now we are going to for few
[11:29] minutes looking at the back side of the
[11:37] book The s
[11:39] seal
[11:41] SE is the
[11:44] [Applause]
[11:47] side nothing is
[11:50] [Music]
[11:53] written it is the back
[11:56] side so the back side
[12:01] there was no writing on the back
[12:05] side that
[12:07] the that is revelation 8
[12:14] verse1 nothing
[12:16] written no
[12:18] sign you hear
[12:20] nothing when the SE was
[12:25] open but it says silent in
[12:39] inen amen so that's why they
[12:43] stopped because God was doing something
[12:47] that was very strange to
[12:52] [Music]
[12:55] them now the book belong to Adam you all
[12:58] know
[12:59] [Music]
[13:02] so
[13:04] it and God took it
[13:07] [Music]
[13:10] back amen so all this
[13:14] time it was on God's
[13:20] Throne waiting for
[13:24] Redemption
[13:27] of to bring back
[13:31] again to his
[13:35] position amen so all this
[13:39] time the the book was upon God's
[13:46] throne and the Lord Jesus
[13:49] Christ
[13:53] second he came
[13:55] now brother says he is the second
[14:00] husband of the
[14:03] [Music]
[14:06] second ever amen amen am and now he
[14:12] stood there as a
[14:15] [Music]
[14:16] mediator amen now there is something
[14:19] very strange
[14:21] [Music]
[14:22] here he speak as a
[14:27] mediator uh throughout the seven Church
[14:35] ages uh Seven
[14:39] Ages
[14:42] yes yeah this is a French
[14:46] [Music]
[14:48] pyamid uh7
[14:52] ages or you say Church
[14:57] ages
[14:59] Seven
[15:01] Ages or we say seven Church
[15:05] ages now the Bible says in the book of
[15:10] Hebrew
[15:11] Jesus is the mediator of the new
[15:16] [Music]
[15:18] T which the seven
[15:22] changes
[15:24] fall fall under the the the the the New
[15:29] [Music]
[15:33] Testament it is the system of God in
[15:42] the the
[15:45] old God had had a
[15:49] system in the
[15:52] old that was your
[15:55] saath saath was the seventh day
[16:01] so the children of
[16:03] Israel were given six
[16:06] days to do their work and on the seven
[16:11] day was
[16:15] theath now the
[16:17] sabath was the day God would come and
[16:20] introduce
[16:27] himself but they couldn't see
[16:31] him on the seventh
[16:34] [Music]
[16:36] day that's why still
[16:40] blind now we have one 2 3
[16:50] 4 now seven days amen seven
[16:55] days he is the mediator
[17:01] he died he
[17:03] died now before he
[17:06] died he was not
[17:10] aiat he was the son
[17:15] of let me repeat
[17:18] again before he died and rose
[17:22] again he was not a
[17:26] mediator he was the son of
[17:31] [Music]
[17:32] men not the Son of
[17:35] God Son
[17:38] of he
[17:41] died
[17:43] again he became the Son of
[17:47] [Music]
[17:48] God is the Holy
[17:52] Ghost and he became a
[17:56] mediator mediator
[17:59] of Ephesians tell
[18:02] you that when he rose
[18:05] again he ascended up to the highest
[18:10] heaven and took his position at the
[18:13] right
[18:16] hand of the
[18:20] majesty and if you look at the right
[18:24] hand if you look at the right
[18:27] hand
[18:28] [Music]
[18:31] from as the Bible I mean in the
[18:35] bible he took the
[18:38] book from the right
[18:41] side amen then he had the book in his
[18:46] right
[18:48] hand and he came down with the
[18:51] [Music]
[18:53] book the right
[18:56] hand and he gave the book to the right
[18:59] hand of
[19:01] [Music]
[19:04] brother for
[19:10] [Music]
[19:15] brother said that is the sword of the
[19:22] king later later
[19:25] on was revealed to him
[19:29] that it's a
[19:33] book that the
[19:36] [Music]
[19:42] book
[19:44] Jesus took it out within
[19:47] [Music]
[19:49] himself the ration of Jesus
[19:53] Christ so he brought that Revelation
[19:57] down
[20:03] and it became a book
[20:06] [Music]
[20:09] in now this
[20:11] book was never written age was never
[20:17] written it was not in a book
[20:21] form because when John tried to
[20:26] write he said don't write
[20:33] [Music]
[20:44] in where he
[20:46] says of the
[20:49] day of his
[20:52] coming no one will
[20:55] know only the father
[21:01] because that is
[21:05] after the Lord lamb left
[21:12] theu so the lamb stood there after his
[21:20] resurrection and but at the opening of
[21:26] the he left that
[21:34] [Music]
[21:35] place no long
[21:39] [Music]
[21:41] [Applause]
[21:42] medior he
[21:46] wasi the seven
[21:49] church at the end of the
[21:53] churches he took
[21:55] the he came down
[21:59] and that's why the Bible
[22:00] says no one
[22:03] knows but only the
[22:06] father not even the
[22:09] son because the sunship is been taken
[22:12] away
[22:14] [Music]
[22:16] the is taken
[22:19] away so it is the
[22:21] father and the
[22:24] subject that's why the Lord Jesus says
[22:28] the true
[22:30] worshipers shall worship the
[22:35] father
[22:38] TR now I will say to
[22:41] you many people even in sou
[22:46] Africa they claim to worship
[22:50] God because God is an object of
[22:55] worship but if it says worship the
[23:01] father not everybody can worship the
[23:06] father takes the je of the
[23:11] [Music]
[23:13] father
[23:14] right all right now that's why
[23:18] everywhere even this
[23:20] morning people are preaching
[23:24] everywhere whether it's doing the church
[23:27] or what the church
[23:28] but they
[23:30] [Music]
[23:45] to because a a
[23:48] son is part of his
[23:53] father that's when we come to the blood
[23:56] l
[23:58] [Music]
[24:04] [Music]
[24:07] you worship
[24:09] God not like
[24:11] others but you worship God as your
[24:16] [Music]
[24:17] father
[24:20] says you can see the word make
[24:25] manifest says that you have seen
[24:33] [Music]
[24:38] have seen
[24:40] [Music]
[24:42] father the
[24:45] Bible it shows
[24:47] that his
[24:49] children have seen
[24:53] him amen but there is some worshipers
[24:58] [Music]
[24:59] but there is his
[25:02] children amen a child is part of his
[25:11] father anybody can
[25:16] worship let's read one scripture
[25:19] here you know that scripture I'll go
[25:22] back
[25:26] to
[25:30] verse let's find John chapter
[25:34] 6 verse
[25:38] 44
[25:45] [Music]
[25:56] 49
[26:18] [Music]
[26:26] 49
[26:32] [Music]
[26:41] all
[26:44] right did you see I think the the pastor
[26:48] would like love us to carry our Bibles
[26:51] every
[26:56] time amen and then some not to take in
[27:03] [Music]
[27:06] notes we can even
[27:11] at because your Bible is your
[27:17] sword so a Believer must keep his
[27:22] sword like a
[27:24] soldier that is the Bible
[27:29] if I come to church I must pick my
[27:35] Bible this is my
[27:37] soul amen all
[27:41] right now he says no can come to
[27:46] me except
[27:51] father it doesn't say
[27:55] God the Father
[28:00] who has sent
[28:01] me
[28:05] him and I will raise him up at the last
[28:10] day so no man can come to
[28:15] me
[28:18] father
[28:20] lordus came from the
[28:23] father so says and
[28:28] God came from the same
[28:31] [Music]
[28:35] place Jesus says no man can come to
[28:42] me
[28:43] except he's coming from the same
[28:50] place if if if he is from the
[28:55] Father which means he is from the spirit
[29:02] [Music]
[29:05] real those who will come to
[29:08] him will also be coming from the spirit
[29:14] real amen then he
[29:18] says it is written
[29:21] verse it is written in the prophets and
[29:24] they shall all be taught of God
[29:27] [Music]
[29:30] every that and leared of the father come
[29:36] unto
[29:38] [Music]
[29:41] me he means that you can only come to
[29:47] him from the
[29:53] father that means you can come to him
[29:58] only if you were there
[30:03] with that's the only way you can come to
[30:08] him amen because your starting
[30:13] point determines your
[30:18] End Amen if you start in God you end up
[30:22] in
[30:24] God if you start in heaven you end up in
[30:32] heaven if you start in the church you
[30:35] end up in a
[30:38] church if you start in you end up in
[30:45] sin we started in in
[30:50] God that's why we are stronger than
[30:56] sin because in our
[31:01] pilgrimage are in a cycle of
[31:06] Eternity Satan canot stop
[31:10] [Music]
[31:11] us amen because we
[31:16] [Music]
[31:19] started now he
[31:21] say listen
[31:23] closely
[31:26] 46 not that any man has seen the
[31:31] father except he who is of
[31:34] [Music]
[31:40] God now the
[31:44] ising
[31:46] [Music]
[31:49] to people cannot see this
[31:56] message some people cannot see the
[32:00] message because they were not
[32:05] there amen because you can only see from
[32:12] there even the Book of
[32:16] John what the Bible says he who is of
[32:25] god amen amen amen now if I have seen
[32:30] the
[32:31] father I am not now trying to see him
[32:35] because I have
[32:38] [Music]
[32:45] seen I have seen
[32:51] father I'm not trying to see him
[32:55] now know
[32:59] [Music]
[33:08] book of
[33:10] joh First
[33:14] John that which was from the
[33:20] beginning of
[33:25] John
[33:28] that which was from the
[33:33] beginning I think is after
[33:40] Peter that which was from the
[33:46] beginning which we
[33:52] have are you
[33:54] [Music]
[33:55] listening that which was from the
[34:00] beginning now this is not the beginning
[34:02] of the Heaven and
[34:06] Earth but he referring to the beginning
[34:09] of the unfolding of
[34:12] [Music]
[34:15] God the unfolding of
[34:21] God in the beginning was the
[34:25] word the word
[34:27] was with
[34:30] God was
[34:33] God so God was coming down in three
[34:40] stages he became into the form of the
[34:43] [Music]
[34:45] word now he calls it the
[34:51] beginning now we have the beginning of
[34:55] Genesis which is the material
[35:01] beginning
[35:03] cre but in this of
[35:08] John beginning was the
[35:11] word this beginning was before the
[35:14] beginning of
[35:15] [Music]
[35:17] Genesis because he made the Heaven and
[35:20] the by his
[35:24] word which means the word was
[35:28] before
[35:31] beginning because he created by the
[35:36] word
[35:45] beginning
[35:50] later so it
[35:52] says that which was from the
[35:55] beginning we have
[35:58] he amen amen so you hear it because you
[36:03] have heard
[36:05] [Music]
[36:08] it the message we hear is the message we
[36:11] have
[36:15] heard the message we
[36:18] see the message we have
[36:22] seen amen because if you haven't seen it
[36:27] you can be toed
[36:29] [Music]
[36:31] about because you don't know you don't
[36:33] see
[36:35] it you know if you are looking for
[36:37] something that you don't
[36:40] see then somebody comes and
[36:47] [Music]
[36:49] say then he comes there the thing is not
[36:54] there no no no no no it is there
[36:57] [Music]
[36:59] once you see
[37:02] it then you will recite
[37:05] there because now you have seen
[37:11] it now the message is something that you
[37:14] must
[37:16] [Music]
[37:19] see hallelujah amen amen okay now now we
[37:25] let's pass this one
[37:27] but it
[37:29] says which we have
[37:32] seen with our
[37:34] [Music]
[37:39] eyes which we have looked
[37:43] upon and our hands have hand the
[37:46] [Music]
[37:48] of that's it so it's something that
[37:51] happened back
[37:53] [Music]
[37:55] there
[37:57] you know to
[38:00] restore you take something back to where
[38:03] it
[38:06] was to
[38:08] redeem is to take something back to
[38:10] where it
[38:13] was it's not it is not new
[38:16] there because it was
[38:19] there then it
[38:22] fell then now you redeem it back to that
[38:25] place again
[38:29] that's it now now now let's read
[38:33] here God bless
[38:36] you in in another book
[38:41] here the future
[38:44] home of the bright and the
[38:48] bright the future
[38:52] home
[38:54] ofde andde
[38:59] it
[39:00] says seven
[39:04] days deals with the old
[39:09] creation the world
[39:12] time and this is your seven
[39:16] days why it's called
[39:20] ages because
[39:25] ages
[39:27] that is seven seven
[39:30] days that is seven
[39:32] [Music]
[39:34] CH and he
[39:37] says and he says 8 Days on the
[39:42] day deals with the new
[39:48] creation which it deals with
[39:52] [Music]
[39:53] eternity so you have two things here
[39:58] as
[40:02] we which
[40:11] is with
[40:14] time now it's time and
[40:19] ET because in the book of
[40:24] Ephesians he said he will bring
[40:29] [Music]
[40:31] together that which is in
[40:37] [Music]
[40:39] heaven
[40:44] BR
[40:47] books two
[40:49] books
[40:53] one only one
