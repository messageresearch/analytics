[1:28:11] I'm here to officiate
[1:28:14] that not to
[1:28:19] preach. But while standing on our feet,
[1:28:23] my brother here will read for me.
[1:28:28] Matthew chapter
[1:28:31] 19 verse 3 to 8. Verse three.
[1:28:38] And then we are going to read again
[1:28:41] proverbs 19
[1:28:45] verse14 19 verse 14 14
[1:28:54] Matthews chapter 19 from verse 3
[1:28:58] to8 the Pharisees also came unto him
[1:29:02] tempting him and saying unto him is it
[1:29:05] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[1:29:07] for recourse. And he answered and said
[1:29:10] unto them, Have ye not read that he
[1:29:14] which made them at the beginning made
[1:29:17] them male and female, and said, For this
[1:29:20] cause shall a man live father and
[1:29:22] mother, and shall live to his wife, and
[1:29:26] they twin shall be one flesh. Wherefore
[1:29:29] they are no more twain, but one flesh.
[1:29:32] What therefore God hath joined together,
[1:29:35] let no man put a sand.
[1:29:38] They say unto him, why did Moses then
[1:29:40] command to give a writing of divor
[1:29:43] divorcement and to put her away? He said
[1:29:47] unto them, Moses, because of the
[1:29:49] hardness of your hearts, suffered you to
[1:29:52] put away your wives, but from the
[1:29:54] beginning it was not so. Amen.
[1:29:58] Uh let us pray.
[1:30:01] My dear heavenly father,
[1:30:05] this is another chance once more.
[1:30:09] A privilege. Yes sir. You have
[1:30:12] privileged me
[1:30:14] with to stand in front of these two
[1:30:18] here. Amen. With their parents. Yes sir.
[1:30:23] I would like you to come and just give
[1:30:25] us something. Hallelujah. Before we can
[1:30:28] join them together.
[1:30:31] I'm
[1:30:32] asking from
[1:30:34] you in the name of our Lord and Savior
[1:30:37] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You may take
[1:30:40] your
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:49] seats. Pastor,
[1:30:52] I'm going to talk about something like
[1:30:54] this.
[1:30:58] The original
[1:31:02] marriage, the real
[1:31:06] marriage is the invisible becoming
[1:31:09] visible.
[1:31:14] This is what I'm going to talk
[1:31:17] about. The real
[1:31:21] marriage
[1:31:22] is when the
[1:31:28] visible become
[1:31:33] visible.
[1:31:35] Amen. When the
[1:31:38] Pharisees came to Jesus,
[1:31:42] talking about the visible
[1:31:46] marriage. Jesus answered them about the
[1:31:49] visible
[1:31:53] visible. He
[1:31:56] said, he who made them in the
[1:32:01] beginning. He said their
[1:32:04] union their their
[1:32:06] union is not when you see them be
[1:32:13] married. Their union is from the
[1:32:19] beginning. He said
[1:32:23] he made them in the
[1:32:26] beginning. He made them male and female.
[1:32:32] That is what Jesus told
[1:32:35] them. But we had to go
[1:32:41] back because he said,
[1:32:44] but in the
[1:32:45] beginning it wasn't
[1:32:49] so then we must go to the beginning and
[1:32:54] see how it
[1:32:56] was. And when we go to the
[1:32:59] beginning, we find the same statement he
[1:33:01] said
[1:33:04] before in verse four. Verse four,
[1:33:07] because the Bible in Genesis 1 verse
[1:33:12] 26-28 26 28 said God said, "Let us make
[1:33:16] men in our own
[1:33:20] image." That's right. And the Bible said
[1:33:23] he made he him.
[1:33:28] in his own
[1:33:30] image and in his own
[1:33:33] likeness. He made him male and
[1:33:38] female and blessed
[1:33:42] them. But we we have to follow the way
[1:33:46] he blessed
[1:33:49] them. Then we we go to Genesis chapter
[1:33:53] 5.
[1:33:55] Read it my brother. We followed the way
[1:33:58] he blessed
[1:34:02] us. Read Genesis 5:2. Let's hear it.
[1:34:05] Genesis 5:2.
[1:34:08] Male and female created he them and
[1:34:11] blessed them and called their name Adam
[1:34:13] in the day when they were created. Amen.
[1:34:17] After he had created
[1:34:20] them male and
[1:34:22] female in his likeness,
[1:34:26] He blessed them.
[1:34:28] Then he
[1:34:30] said, "You are Adam."
[1:34:34] The Bible says he called them
[1:34:40] Adam. When after he had created
[1:34:45] them, that is the first union.
[1:34:51] A man in the likeness of God.
[1:34:56] Then we go to Genesis chapter 2
[1:35:01] then I think is verse
[1:35:04] um verse 21 and
[1:35:08] 25 21 because Genesis 1 26 and
[1:35:16] 286 28 it was the invisible
[1:35:21] marriage. It was the the invisible
[1:35:29] union just like our prophet has preached
[1:35:32] the
[1:35:34] message the invisible union of the bride
[1:35:37] and
[1:35:41] bride. That is what has happened to
[1:35:45] us. We we had a invisible union with
[1:35:50] Christ.
[1:35:53] But in the merry supper
[1:35:55] there it will be a visible
[1:35:58] union. Are you together now? Amen. The
[1:36:03] prophet preached
[1:36:05] that it has already
[1:36:08] happened the invisible
[1:36:12] union between the bride and the
[1:36:16] bright. But we are waiting for the
[1:36:18] visible one.
[1:36:21] In Genesis chapter
[1:36:24] 1, it was an invisible you
[1:36:28] know. And in Genesis 2 25-
[1:36:32] 26 25 26
[1:36:36] 21-2 it was the visible
[1:36:41] union. Those who were together
[1:36:44] before they were brought again to be
[1:36:47] together.
[1:36:54] And that is that is the real
[1:36:57] marriage. The real marriage is the in is
[1:37:00] the invisible becoming
[1:37:05] [Applause]
[1:37:08] visible. But the the the m which is not
[1:37:14] real is when the invisible is not
[1:37:17] becoming visible.
[1:37:21] Because we have got the two seeds
[1:37:26] here. The seeds from Satan's
[1:37:30] which was swn by
[1:37:33] Satan the seed which was which was sown
[1:37:36] by
[1:37:37] God. If the the one from the seed of
[1:37:42] Satan, if
[1:37:44] someone from the seed of
[1:37:46] Satan wanted to marry
[1:37:49] one from the seed of
[1:37:52] God, that one, it is not the invisible
[1:37:56] union become invisible.
[1:38:01] That one will have to
[1:38:04] stop or it will have to be a
[1:38:09] tolerated marriage.
[1:38:18] Because that is what you call
[1:38:23] magbas. This does not belong here.
[1:38:27] But you try to
[1:38:29] preach. When you try to put it there,
[1:38:32] sometimes it will just hold for a
[1:38:35] while when you still driving the wheel
[1:38:38] will get out
[1:38:40] [Applause]
[1:38:44] because it is mas.
[1:38:57] Amen.
[1:38:58] after he had created
[1:39:01] them in his own
[1:39:05] image. Amen. If a man is
[1:39:09] alone is not the complete image of
[1:39:13] God. Amen. If a woman is alone is not a
[1:39:17] complete image of
[1:39:19] God. The complete image of
[1:39:22] God is male and
[1:39:25] female. Amen. The correct marriage
[1:39:29] here is a good
[1:39:31] type because God was foreseeing
[1:39:34] something
[1:39:36] coming. The bride and the
[1:39:41] bridegroom when he was making this
[1:39:44] marriage. He was foreseeing something
[1:39:47] there. And if you see this one, if you
[1:39:51] see this one, you already see something
[1:39:55] coming there.
[1:39:57] The real marriage
[1:39:58] here, the real
[1:40:00] marriage because Jesus said,
[1:40:04] Paul said, "A woman must be
[1:40:09] submissive under his
[1:40:12] husband just like Christ and his
[1:40:14] church."
[1:40:17] In other words, the real
[1:40:20] marriage in his
[1:40:23] church, the marriage Jesus is talking
[1:40:26] about
[1:40:27] here, it it wasn't so in the
[1:40:30] beginning because he who made them in
[1:40:32] the beginning, he made the male and
[1:40:39] female after he had created
[1:40:43] them. Then in Genesis chapter 2,
[1:40:47] We
[1:40:48] see God
[1:40:50] saying
[1:40:52] taking the
[1:40:54] soil making a
[1:40:57] formation then taking that create
[1:41:01] created and put it into a
[1:41:06] formation. Are you together? He took
[1:41:10] that creation
[1:41:13] and put it into the formation.
[1:41:17] When the creation in is in the
[1:41:22] formation and God said it is not good.
[1:41:27] Even man is
[1:41:29] alone because it it was not like this in
[1:41:32] the
[1:41:38] for the Bible says it seems Adam was
[1:41:43] alone because part of
[1:41:46] him was still a
[1:41:51] theophant. So God said now I must bring
[1:41:55] these two
[1:41:57] to be
[1:41:58] visible.
[1:42:01] Amen. He cause a man to a deep
[1:42:04] sleep out of his
[1:42:07] body God
[1:42:09] created for that
[1:42:13] man a
[1:42:15] wife. But you
[1:42:17] must, this one is a secret.
[1:42:21] You mustn't talk it loudly.
[1:42:25] God
[1:42:26] took the the
[1:42:31] plan of this
[1:42:35] woman from
[1:42:38] Satan.
[1:42:40] Okay. When he created this female,
[1:42:46] the plan plan was from Satan. Hey, it's
[1:42:49] a
[1:42:52] secret because he was the only beautiful
[1:43:02] creature among all the
[1:43:06] creation. All right, let's leave it
[1:43:09] there, pastor. Let's just put it down
[1:43:11] there. But let's go on with what we
[1:43:14] have. He took from the reap
[1:43:20] and created for this
[1:43:24] man a
[1:43:26] woman. Amen. The Bible says
[1:43:30] here, riches and
[1:43:34] everything, you can get them from your
[1:43:39] parents. But a prudent
[1:43:44] woman, you will get it from God.
[1:43:49] Amen. That's why the Bible says before
[1:43:53] you
[1:43:54] marry you must approach marries
[1:44:00] prayerfully. Why does it say
[1:44:03] prayerfully? Because a prudent
[1:44:07] woman you can get it from God only.
[1:44:13] So you must
[1:44:16] ask so that you can be
[1:44:19] given because he
[1:44:21] said ask it shall be
[1:44:25] given.
[1:44:26] Amen. But
[1:44:30] because they are rushing,
[1:44:37] they cannot wait to to be given.
[1:44:46] They
[1:44:47] rush and when they rush it make Satan
[1:44:53] happy. That is that is what Satan
[1:44:56] want for the young men to
[1:45:00] rush so that he can use their
[1:45:03] eyes. So that Satan can use their
[1:45:09] eyes to
[1:45:11] choose so that they can choose according
[1:45:13] to
[1:45:19] him. Right? After he had made a
[1:45:26] wife from this
[1:45:29] one, he
[1:45:31] then took the feminine
[1:45:36] spirit from
[1:45:38] Adam and put it into
[1:45:43] this. That's why he
[1:45:46] said, "Let me go on reading."
[1:45:50] He said in verse five, verse
[1:45:53] five, "For this
[1:45:56] cause shall a man leave father and
[1:46:01] mother and shall live to his
[1:46:05] wife, and they
[1:46:07] twin shall be one flesh."
[1:46:12] Amen.
[1:46:16] Why?
[1:46:18] Why should why should he leave his
[1:46:21] mother and
[1:46:25] father? Because he was born
[1:46:30] there but it was not his
[1:46:34] original and this woman was born
[1:46:39] there because of birth. They were born
[1:46:42] from different parents.
[1:46:47] But
[1:46:48] original they came from one
[1:46:53] source. When they
[1:46:55] recognize that we are original, we are
[1:47:00] together. They leave their
[1:47:03] parents. They came
[1:47:07] together because now they have
[1:47:10] recognized that we were
[1:47:13] together. Oh,
[1:47:16] because a a sister and a brother
[1:47:21] originally if they are children of
[1:47:25] God to together they together they came
[1:47:30] from the mind of
[1:47:32] God
[1:47:34] together. Amen. Then they were born
[1:47:37] here from different
[1:47:40] parents but together they came from one
[1:47:45] place. Amen.
[1:47:47] I and my
[1:47:49] brother we came from the same
[1:47:53] place. Amen. That's why we have seen the
[1:47:58] message.
[1:48:02] We we have had people well long ago
[1:48:06] But not long because I'm not I'm not I'm
[1:48:08] not old.
[1:48:12] Who is oldest?
[1:48:19] And then
[1:48:21] um we used to sing a
[1:48:25] song when we were outside of the
[1:48:29] message.
[1:48:32] [Music]
[1:48:33] Oh
[1:48:34] God, we don't know how God can make us
[1:48:37] one.
[1:48:40] But
[1:48:42] God brought a something to make us one
[1:48:49] which is the
[1:48:51] message because you come from your place
[1:48:54] there and you come you've come from a a
[1:48:59] Pentecost
[1:49:01] church assemblies assemblies of God in
[1:49:04] South Africa assemblies of God South
[1:49:06] Africa and you come from Lutheran church
[1:49:08] in America
[1:49:10] and Methodist church. You come from
[1:49:13] different places and God has brought the
[1:49:16] oneness
[1:49:17] here and the oneness is the
[1:49:21] message. When you come to the message,
[1:49:24] you become
[1:49:27] one. That is what makes you
[1:49:30] one. Then a a young man is
[1:49:34] born at family.
[1:49:39] and a sister
[1:49:43] family. Then they go brought them to the
[1:49:48] message because it it was their
[1:49:52] place and they find each
[1:49:55] other in the message.
[1:49:58] Amen. Because it is their
[1:50:01] place where they come from. Amen. But I
[1:50:06] mean those who have received the
[1:50:10] message. He who hears my
[1:50:13] word and believeth on whom he sent
[1:50:17] me has everlasting
[1:50:21] life. But the prophet
[1:50:24] says a drunkard can hear
[1:50:28] it and a pro can hear
[1:50:31] it and say I believe you.
[1:50:35] But when we say he who he
[1:50:40] has, we mean he who it is revealed to
[1:50:47] him. That is you see. Hi. Are you
[1:50:52] listening
[1:50:54] [Applause]
[1:50:56] people? The word of God is a
[1:51:00] seat. Amen. Some people just read here
[1:51:02] and stop
[1:51:05] here. You must move with the
[1:51:09] word. If you can stop
[1:51:13] here, you will bring people to a wrong
[1:51:21] station. So when he said he
[1:51:25] who then we go further, he says he that
[1:51:29] have an ear.
[1:51:31] Let him hear. You hear because you've
[1:51:35] got
[1:51:37] the is not everyone who
[1:51:40] hears who
[1:51:43] accept. Amen. Some will say I have heard
[1:51:47] but they have had nothing.
[1:51:50] They will tell you the prophet
[1:51:55] says but they have got
[1:52:01] nothing. They
[1:52:03] stop at some certain
[1:52:08] quotes. They stop there. They said the
[1:52:11] prophet said this but they don't know
[1:52:14] what what he had said
[1:52:16] there. Amen.
[1:52:20] The Bible doesn't say
[1:52:23] go the Holy Ghost take the
[1:52:28] message and give it to a
[1:52:33] sheep. The Holy Ghost brings the
[1:52:37] message directly to the
[1:52:41] shepherd because it is the Holy Ghost
[1:52:45] which has made that
[1:52:48] shepherd can't it can't make a
[1:52:51] shepherd and leave the shepherd there
[1:52:54] and give the message to a
[1:53:00] sheep the Holy
[1:53:04] You must not forget we have got fake
[1:53:07] pastors
[1:53:09] here.
[1:53:16] Fake
[1:53:17] those. The Holy Ghost will never take
[1:53:20] the message to
[1:53:21] them. You better take it to a ship.
[1:53:29] [Music]
[1:53:34] Amen. He says here
[1:53:37] for this cause
[1:53:40] shall a man
[1:53:42] live father
[1:53:48] mother it they is where they were born.
[1:53:54] Amen. Because this
[1:53:56] flesh is brought here by
[1:54:00] sin. We were
[1:54:03] born in sin,
[1:54:07] shaped in
[1:54:09] iniquity, coming to the world, speaking
[1:54:15] life. A person who is not born
[1:54:19] again, his nature is to speak life.
[1:54:26] When he speaks
[1:54:29] lie, no conscience,
[1:54:34] he will tell you a lie. When you say,
[1:54:37] "But my brother, you said like this." He
[1:54:40] said, "No,
[1:54:48] me." Amen. Because of
[1:54:51] that no one is born a without sin
[1:54:59] we we were born with sin all of
[1:55:03] us but God
[1:55:08] brought something which will take us
[1:55:10] from that
[1:55:14] position because from the
[1:55:17] beginning before the
[1:55:19] Beginning he had a
[1:55:22] thought that he wanted to be a
[1:55:26] savior. That is why we were born
[1:55:31] sinners so that he can come and save
[1:55:35] us. Amen. He have not come to save
[1:55:38] sinners.
[1:55:46] Sinners
[1:55:48] will never be saved.
[1:55:53] They are born sinners.
[1:55:56] Hell is created for Satan and his
[1:56:06] angels.
[1:56:09] Those who are defeated there in
[1:56:13] heaven who Satan has deceived
[1:56:17] in they are here in
[1:56:21] flesh. Those who have defeated Satan
[1:56:25] there are also here
[1:56:29] in now we are fighting
[1:56:32] here. Our fight doesn't start
[1:56:35] here. Amen.
[1:56:38] And it will never
[1:56:40] end. It will end at the Armageddon.
[1:56:49] I was in
[1:56:50] Christ. You were in
[1:56:53] Christ. Let me read here. He never came
[1:56:57] to save the devil's
[1:57:01] children. They never will know it.
[1:57:09] Because we are born in
[1:57:10] sin. Let me read. Go on. And they are so
[1:57:15] sh in their ways of their intellectual
[1:57:20] learning that you can't compare with
[1:57:24] them at all.
[1:57:29] They can put scriptures in a
[1:57:32] way as you can say this
[1:57:39] brother. He said you cannot compare with
[1:57:42] them compare but they don't have a
[1:57:45] revelation. That one they will never
[1:57:49] have. Even if they can go to the
[1:57:52] mountain and fast, they will come
[1:57:55] without the
[1:57:58] [Applause]
[1:57:58] [Music]
[1:58:02] rest. You can't compare with them at
[1:58:06] all. You can't out talk
[1:58:10] them, but by faith you see it.
[1:58:15] [Music]
[1:58:17] Amen. He knew you are going to born at
[1:58:20] that family
[1:58:24] system. He knew that. He said but I will
[1:58:28] come and save that
[1:58:31] sister. He knew brother
[1:58:36] that. And he said I will come and save
[1:58:39] that
[1:58:40] brother so that he can meet that
[1:58:43] sister. They will they will meet each
[1:58:46] other.
[1:58:47] in the message.
[1:58:53] Amen. That's why he
[1:58:54] said under no
[1:58:58] circumstances should a
[1:59:01] believer marry an
[1:59:05] unbeliever because they don't come from
[1:59:08] the
[1:59:11] same. Amen. Amen. But the problem is
[1:59:16] in here
[1:59:18] we have those those who seem to be
[1:59:23] Christians but they are not
[1:59:28] Christian then they come to me as a
[1:59:31] pastor Mar as
[1:59:33] pastor I married them
[1:59:37] but I don't know where they come
[1:59:42] But they've said they believe the
[1:59:45] message and I believe
[1:59:53] that their
[1:59:55] lives will prove.
[2:00:00] [Applause]
[2:00:01] Amen. For this
[2:00:03] cause,
[2:00:05] man shall leave his
[2:00:08] father and mother and
[2:00:12] cleave to his
[2:00:15] wife. Because if they come from one
[2:00:18] source, when they come together, they
[2:00:22] cleave.
[2:00:24] That's why he says here what God has put
[2:00:29] together no one should put a
[2:00:35] son if he had created them male and
[2:00:39] female who will
[2:00:42] separate no one. But if if they were not
[2:00:46] united
[2:00:48] there they will never be
[2:00:51] united. Amen.
[2:00:54] They don't have the same
[2:00:58] blood because if if they were united
[2:01:02] there blood of Jesus
[2:01:05] Christ was shed for them connect them
[2:01:10] together again.
[2:01:16] He said that
[2:01:22] wherefore what therefore
[2:01:26] God had joined
[2:01:28] together let no
[2:01:31] man put us
[2:01:34] under when Adam and
[2:01:38] Eve when Adam was woken up by
[2:01:43] God when he
[2:01:45] look No one said there who is this
[2:01:48] man who this man when he woke up he said
[2:01:53] this is the bone of my
[2:01:55] bone the flesh of my
[2:01:59] flesh that is a young
[2:02:02] man when he see the
[2:02:05] sister for the first time he said this
[2:02:08] one will be my
[2:02:11] wife without
[2:02:14] reason the prophet says
[2:02:16] that one will be your
[2:02:18] wife. But if you say, "I will marry this
[2:02:22] one because he's more beautiful than
[2:02:28] me." You see, if if this
[2:02:31] one does not agree, then I will I will
[2:02:35] try Salamita.
[2:02:39] [Applause]
[2:02:45] This is not the original marriage. Amen.
[2:02:48] the original marriage you see the one
[2:02:50] you come from the same place
[2:02:55] with In other words if she can
[2:03:00] refuse you will never have another
[2:03:05] option is the only
[2:03:09] one but if you have got another
[2:03:13] option you better not marry
[2:03:17] until you have got
[2:03:23] one. This is the the one
[2:03:28] and the sister sister when the when she
[2:03:31] looks at the brother
[2:03:34] she look
[2:03:35] down this this brother there is
[2:03:38] something which connect me
[2:03:42] to she's the same the only one
[2:03:48] She can receive,
[2:03:51] she doesn't laugh,
[2:03:53] if I can say I love you. If she can say
[2:03:58] I love you, she's telling you a
[2:04:02] lie, where where does she get that
[2:04:06] love? That one is from the devil's
[2:04:11] children. Hallelujah.
[2:04:14] We received the love from Christ.
[2:04:18] He loved me first.
[2:04:21] Before I can love him,
[2:04:24] I didn't say I love you. He loved me
[2:04:27] first and died for
[2:04:32] me. While I was still a sinner,
[2:04:39] he loved me.
[2:04:42] I accepted this
[2:04:46] love. When a sister accept the love,
[2:04:51] he she will make
[2:04:53] sure that love must
[2:05:01] stay. He she will try to polish
[2:05:07] it because this love descended to
[2:05:12] her.
[2:05:13] Why? Why this brother just marries
[2:05:17] me among
[2:05:22] sisters. I'm talking about the true
[2:05:26] sister. But the wrong one, you know, if
[2:05:30] that one doesn't last with me, I will
[2:05:32] take
[2:05:38] brothers because I love I love more than
[2:05:42] this
[2:05:46] one. You see this this
[2:05:50] this devil's
[2:05:52] children, they say they have got a
[2:05:54] laugh.
[2:05:56] Where did they get that love? From
[2:05:59] Satan.

[2:11:15] grandfather. Rebecca was in his in her
[2:11:18] great great
[2:11:25] the

[2:11:31] And Isaac was in his great
[2:11:38] great and that great their great
[2:11:42] great was terror.
[2:11:46] They were together
[2:11:47] there but they were
[2:11:50] born from different
[2:11:53] lineage. This one went through this
[2:11:56] lineage. This one came through this
[2:11:59] lineage
[2:12:02] until find
[2:12:05] Rebecca. It was the invisible marriage
[2:12:10] there in the lo of
[2:12:13] terror. But

[2:13:50] of God.
[2:13:52] Amen. Can you stand up on your feet?

[2:14:04] If you are
[2:14:06] here, if you are not born
[2:14:09] again, you better marry the one who is
[2:14:12] not born
[2:14:16] again because you are going to the same

[2:14:25] not people who are not born
[2:14:27] again, they don't know who they
[2:14:32] are. A woman doesn't know who she
[2:14:37] is. A man doesn't know who he
[2:14:43] is. So they must marry one
[2:14:46] another. But here in the
