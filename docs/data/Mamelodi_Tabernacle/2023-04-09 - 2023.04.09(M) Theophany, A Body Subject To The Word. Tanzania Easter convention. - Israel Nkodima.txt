Description:
Title: Theophany, A Body Subject To The Word

This message was preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima in Tanzania at Ubungo End Time Message Church. 
Date: 09-04-2023 M

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about A Theophany, which is a body subject to the word. A theophany has a far better hearing and a far better eyesight.

The Pastor read Genesis 14: 18 - 20

18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

He indicated that every preacher is preaching from a theophany. We do not listen with our ears but with our inward man. Because the word is not natural but it is supernatural. If the word is not from a theophany is just a word but It should be from theophany to a theophany.

He further showed that it was Abraham and his seed who received the promises. And the seed of Abraham paid Tithes in Abraham and met Melchisedec in Abraham. 

Whether we’re young or whether we’re old, what difference does it make? The main thing, are you ready to meet Him? Do you love Him? Can you serve Him? Have you sold out to the things of the world? Have you met Melchisedec since the battle was over?
57-0915E - Hebrews, Chapter Seven #1

105 Notice, after the battle was over, Melchisedec served His victorious child communion; think of that, part of Himself! Now we want to see here. In type here is, in view, the communion. After the battle, He gave of Himself, because the communion is part of Christ. And after the struggle is over, after you’ve done got yourself whipped out, 

    65-0221E - Who Is This Melchisedec?
  
Melchisedec was called God, and he became Jesus. When he is in the seed of Abraham he is called Melchisedec.

of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which have delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tights of all amen oh okay sir thank you foreign God bless you okay meanwhile I will say the prophet says the age of this now audition Church he would take the mask off the whole thing yeah and God bless you sir he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see what a glorious thing because we are not for just I will I will call it a a short message although we don't there is no short message and we are looking at this ethio funny no it says this body is subject to the word [Applause] now we have been talking about faith in God but we are talking about still funny he says it's a body subject to the way as you all know you have read it where it says you have heard from your three or five years because brother Ibrahim says has a better hearing I mean so we've been talking about faith now we want to look at the fuel funnies of which he says it is subject to the word [Music] amen especially in this age as he has disclosed here this age of the logician church he would take the mask of for the whole thing and we could see the whole thing amen amen then we'll continue as Abraham Ibrahim when he was looking for a city [Music] and you know I'm talking to the Seed of Abraham about my training now Galatians says the seat of Abraham is Christ Amen brother Brenham says he says we are Christ meaning in Christ we are all called Christ accordingly according to the prophet and I believe him because that's the word that's why if it says Christ The Mystery of God revealed [Music] it's talking about the whole family of God [Music] which is the whole because he says he Reveals His church because his church is part of the threefold revelation when he is revealed his church is revealed when he died we died when he resurrected we resurrected with him when he is revealed we are revealed amen I saw that is his word according he says and that's eternal if you have eternal life amen now let's look at the theophany a body is subject to the way amen amen he speaks of how Abraham I'm praying I've never heard of any other person who met melchized [Music] but it's Abraham then the prophet says as it was how he met melchized again now another thing Melchizedek came to Abraham as a man [Music] [Applause] okay and then he says the same thing will happen at the end of time then if milk is a dick and met Abraham as a man Melchizedek will make the city will meet the Seed of Abraham as a man [Music] [Applause] that's why we will read and see it in the books here the prophet speaking to to us so we and we were who has preached to us it was even this morning having a day to come our preacher moving do you know who is our preacher because every preacher is preaching from the theater [Music] if the weight is not from the three or five then it is just a word but it should be from theophany [Music] amen we don't listen with ears we are listening with our inward men because the word is not natural it is money if it is natural it will be received by the nature this is what we are looking at amen amen and if it is eternal it is it will be received by eternity okay now I I we will just look at this perhaps you don't know [Music] did you know that there is another person in you [Music] did you know that he asked me that question he asked you that question he said did you know it that there is another person in you all right now I will read this when he met Melchizedek I've never heard of any other person meeting [Music] have you do you know of any other person okay do you only know Abraham yes sir and the seed the only people the only person who met milk he said is Abraham [Music] and his seat [Applause] even those who were not born at that time the Bible says they met milk he said in Abraham [Applause] they even paid the time in Abraham [Applause] that's why they continue paying their time oh because they started paying ties before they were born [Music] amen that's what I'm saying I don't know of any other person who has met Abel kisado I I only know Abraham because the seeds foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yeah all right galatian says it says Galatians chapter 3. I don't know if some people really read the scriptures one Galatians chapter 3 says now to Abraham and his seat where the promise is made foreign [Applause] [Music] Abraham and his foreign you see the difference all right when he met Abraham we met Abra we met melchized foreign [Music] [Music] that is the Hebrew Book the first time some years back I met brother rediff pastorative he offered me this book now since ever I have the books I it's from this book Hebrew Hebrews and page 308 then where he says are you ready to meet him that's the prophet do you love him can you save him have you sold out to their things of the world have you met Melchizedek this is the battle was over all right now let's start here king of Salem amen that means Jerusalem that's why when Abraham was looking for a city [Music] and he met this King now brother Brennan says he met the king at the literal sport where the city will come amen amen and as we see in the last Church age there's a migration ah rupturing as we were looking at the Elijah when after he has seen The Chariot he started rupturing towards the chariot he knew that as we know the rapture is already around here sometimes we look upwards because the Rapture is just here with us all right we are all ready did you know that that the true Sons and Daughters of God what foreign [Music] I mean before he was taken he walked with God for Elijah was taken he walked with God and he was lecturing Beyond Jordan it will happen so he started off with Elisha having a rupture in faith I believe we have we have Rapture in faith today working with him amen we are not thinking of going back because I feel funny you will never think of such things okay what is in US is another person and that's why we are on a Runway oh man no matter what the world says okay now I'm going to read this pattern this book is a great book who is this who is this who are you not who has that milk [Music] he is no longer that foreign [Applause] now what is the answer because he's the person of the seven sins [Applause] when the seals were opened but then who is this now if I say to you who is who is this who is now I don't think you'll be looking around up and down because I have said this yeah it is understandable if I can say who is that then you look around you you'll be looking for that but if I say this this now where are you looking because this it should be this [Applause] have you said Amen to that brother amen we are talking about this [Music] okay because as it was so shall it be if he met me we should meet me [Applause] [Music] as the seed one thing when brother Brenham says came to Abraham as a man right so it is a man he ate with Abraham talk to Abraham and he says he was in the house [Applause] okay uh if then we believe that he appeared to Abraham in the form of a man we believe that even at the end of time as it was he will appear again as a man [Applause] I I think it's not climbing up a mountain says you'll hear him he will give you an account of it he says in this very same book who is this is a great book s [Music] he says who is this he says how how many have you've heard me reading it yeah [Music] he came as a prophet [Applause] yeah now only milky said only the Seed of Abraham can see that [Applause] if I Abraham comes and say who is or the prophet the brother says who is this Melchizedek only the Seed of Abraham okay we'll be able to answer can I repeat that it's a question who is this who else can answer that unless if it's not the Seed of Abraham [Music] all right awesome let me read he says are you ready to meet him then he asked have you met Melchizedek since the battle is over because Abraham met him after the battle now brother Brandon tells me that seven Church ages these are battles every Church is so if you that's why out of every Church age you have one they call the Overcomers [Applause] you'll find out of every Church [Music] that's what they called they're overcome he who overcome I shall give this in the next age amen amen and Overcomers are set aside a brother was asking he was saying I don't know whether the battle of Armageddon is coming or has passed the battle of Armageddon was fought in heaven tells you that first thing in heaven [Music] [Applause] have you seen that he says the first thing in heaven was abandoned and he says and Satan and his angels were cast out yes and later he says and the Angels were subject to become human [Music] [Applause] then he says now it came down and well then it was in the Mind of Men but he says it will end up and the it will end up in the battle of Armageddon in heaven it says there was war in heaven but brother Brennan says it will end up in the battle called it came and he said from Heaven Satan cast out by Michael and the battle started here on Earth it became human and the battle started in the mind of man but he says it will end up are in the battle called the Battle of armor all right what we are seeing now the gorgeous he said watch Russia [Music] amen amen we see the river you Francis drying up and now they say it is dry and they are seeing things there because what did Revelation 12 says is it 16 12. Revelation 16 verse 12. and the sixth Angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water there off was dried up that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared foreign [Music] we are so blessed that God has sent us a prophet [Music] so we know okay the better there now we've seen people mixing these things they cannot make it out what is the battle of Armageddon now I read my Cod book that those Who has fought they are going to fight the best they'll get engaged God is not expecting some new people no the same people like if Karma you were defeated in heaven you'll continue [Applause] if you have one in heaven you will you'll continue to win now the battle of Armageddon that's why people don't understand because it would it will not be fought by new people foreign [Music] [Applause] did we read it what did it say s and the sixth Angel thought out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared amen amen it it is dry Brothers amen for the kings of the East to come down you know we were reading when putting was saying he are pointing at Jerusalem saying I wanted that Temple foreign because in these battles he is also Paving away to go to Jerusalem and the Bible says he will follow upon the mountains of brother Branham speaks of God yes upon the mountains of Jerusalem foreign yeah yeah meaning this it comes with some meanings the princess and his land no some people what uh they're looking at the Ukraine that's it that's God get married no it's only a sign it is it begins that way it will happen immediately after the Rapture [Applause] now if you want to take it take it from the prophet immediately after the Rapture brother do you know when is the Battle of which other people [Music] the other battle of Armageddon you know when it will come [Music] say it after the tribulation says that's after the tribulation then it will come [Applause] today all right the battle is because the Lord Jesus is coming to take over now that's why there's a bedroom Satan was trying to take over and Michael cast him down as you see today the Lord is coming to take over what I do we will see that it is in the spoken word let's read this song Abraham Ibrahim I will start there when Lord down in Sodom okay two of them went down there and Lord saw two of them coming and he said my laws but do you know Abraham I saw a tree but he said my Lord but the Lord said my Lord Abraham said my Lord out of those three he recognized one and this one remained with Abraham [Music] and the two went on but the Lord remained with Abraham that's why I never said Lords he didn't recognize the other two but he recognized this one you know today there's so many messages [Music] all right to be the message he says Lord was not a prophet that's right or neither was a messenger so he didn't have any revelation of him revelation of him that's why today we need a prophet ah whom God can speak to you that's why we no only love one prophet okay because we are part we are part of that profession Lord could call them Lords a dozen of them says but no matter how many Abrahams saw it was still one Lord [Applause] yes yes amen notice after the battle was over Melchizedek saved his Victorious child communion think of that part of himself [Applause] right part of himself Bread and Wine and we see it in John 6. the Lord says except you drink the blood of the son of man and it's the body you have no life he was talking to the people who could who could maybe try to prove to him breathing and jumping and say why you say we don't we don't have life you have no life and they could say Can't You See Me but to him that is not life because he is any other movement foreign [Applause] he used here in in John 14. let me find out I tried it somewhere but it didn't work for me um [Music] okay let us start he says victory and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also [Music] and where I go you know you know and the way you know did you see did you hear him he's not asking them questions because he is talking to a three of our new year I go you know and the way you know and Thomas said no no Lord we know not without going and how can we know the way amen amen it was Thomas the natural one Jesus said unto him I am the way now you what she doesn't say I have foreign [Applause] [Music] you you should have known my father it takes you again to a three-fold also and from henceforth you know him number two and have seen him now he was not talking to a natural Thomas because the national Thomas would not know amen [Music] that's why the seventh seal is not to a natural brother no there's somebody in you he was talking to somebody behind the natural Thomas naturally he would not know but then he says you know you know and Thomas says we don't know what do we now he's not talking to this Thomas he's facing [Music] you [Applause] let's read this or you don't know brother if he had known me you should have known my father also now are you listening to the language from henceforth you know him it seems as if he is forcing on them they say we don't know he says you know [Music] from Hillsborough you know him and have seen him [Applause] he's talking to somebody here you know that book it says the back the back say it brother the back side of the book you met down now he's talking to the backside of Thomas so because the Thomas that is standing before him he's scratching his head but he's talking to the back side [Applause] okay verse eight Phillip was listening also he he came in also all right show us the father [Applause] hey it was a big meeting here the Lord addressing the people but took him to the back side [Applause] of the same people before then why foreign [Applause] [Applause] Lord me also many people I've got a question for you here show us the father and it sufficient us amen amen we want to prove yeah we want he was listening all the time amen amen then Jesus said unto him [Music] have I been so long time with you has thou not known me he that has seen me has seen the father [Applause] and the house says show us the father hey it was a battle here he was talking to the back side Believers now Believers now not that I am in the father and the father in me but he didn't continue to say an eye in you [Music] he was still supposed to go to Golgotha the ways that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me foreign [Applause] because he told them you have seen him but the Holy Ghost had not come here let's see it so they could they couldn't recognize that's why when it is revealed it says foreign [Music] so it was still running to accomplish the threefold Revelation because they couldn't know him because it was still a twofold amen that's why he said to the Jews I and my father he never said he never continued I I and my father R1 amen so it's supposed to be that's why I say his father Son and Holy Ghost amen but with the Jews the Gentiles were not yet amen then when the Gentiles [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] on floor if he speaks it will run through the three fours okay that's what he saw [Music] here again I remember one day John 4 tells us of this who was this woman the summer written yeah she met the Lord Jesus Christ she came for water verse 7 here give me to drink to the woman for his disciples were gone away and to the city to buy yeah [Music] when the Jews went into the city [Music] [Applause] God knew how to separate them for these disciples who had gone away somewhere of Summer here unto him how is it that being a Jew asked drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with their Samaritans and Jesus answered Satan to her if thou knoweth the gift of God and who it is that said today give me to drink ask of him and he would have given the Living Water [Music] the summer Returns the Samaritan speaks of the well wow and the water from that well and the Lord answered if you knew he would have asked from me she has a will and the Lord was himself a well now she didn't know about this well she knew about the Natural History well then listen verse 11. the woman said unto him he said thou has nothing to draw with and and the well is deep from whence then once then has thou that Living Water chapter [Music] she was preaching to the Lord Jesus which gave us the well and drank therefore himself and his children and his cattle yeah [Music] she introduced me the well and Jesus introduced his will whosoever drinketh of this water shall fast again that is [Music] now let me introduce mine but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water [Music] bringing up into everlasting life [Applause] amen amen she was supposed to drink from this well okay amen I'll say this the woman said unto him sir give me this water she has listening and now she realized she realized that there is another well better than this well you must always know that day there is better something that what you have amen get it from him then Jesus said all right now go call your husband we've been talking bring your husband just to expose her yeah [Music] you know the story now let's take this Abraham notice after the battle was over there Melchizedek served his Victoria's child Eureka think of that what was this communion part of himself [Music] did you know that yeah the communion is saved was part of himself now we want to see here here is in view the communion after the battle he gave off himself I don't know if we we are together here he gave Abraham of himself part of himself because the communion part of Christ [Music] and after the struggle is over that is after the struggle is over we'll finish with this seeing that Christianity is a better life [Applause] that's why the people come and fall away come in followers [Music] they say hey that brother was a wonderful brother foreign [Music] [Music] those who fought in heaven maybe you don't know if you have failed in heaven you will continue to face [Applause] because you have won we will continue to win brother Brandon speaks about it [Music] if you have failed will continue to face [Music] if you have failed in this change and you go for another church you are still going to fail [Applause] if you could not make it here and they change to another change amen you are still continuing [Music] to continue to Faith if you have failed you're going to fail all right that's why now this is how he gave him part of him I'm sure I'm sure somebody's listening foreign [Music] to give you something special is part of himself he can't give you something less because you'll be a Target Satan if he is an overcomer and he has to give you part of himself [Music] [Applause] so that because I live he says because I live [Music] okay somebody talk to me he says because I live here also live [Music] Because He Lives I Can Face tomorrow because he lives in me I Can Face Tomorrow [Music] this is a great thing he says because I live you too shall live he has given you part of himself he wants you to be who he is if he dies he dies with you if he resurrection and he said before because I live you too shall live I don't live because I've done this and done that [Music] I have fasted I I live because he lives amen okay this is what he says here amen and then he continued and after the struggle is over yeah you've got to to go through that struggle first Young sister comes [Music] get baptized then she will decide to go out [Music] tempted to test his sin out then later she comes back and say I want God to forgive me did you know that she won't be the same again is your form yeah amen amen because once a man or a woman has seen God one guy once God has made a covenant with the person [Music] because God forgot to be your God doesn't walk he has to establish a governance with you that's why he said I shall establish my Covenant with them then they shall be my people we were talking about that how God established a covenant with the children of Israel [Music] Cinema I remembered my Covenant because the Covenant finds God even after they have sinned they were saved by the Covenants amen amen he led them to go into captivity because of their sins foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] right now you know the meeting on man Transfiguration with Moses and Elijah and Christ they were talking about it and you'll see them later in Jerusalem so after God has remembered his Covenant now he held a meeting with Moses Japanese [Applause] talking about his ministry in Jerusalem then we'll see them in Jerusalem amen amen when Moses Musa see but the spirit of Elijah of the Gentiles [Music] of of the Gentiles [Music] will carry on even into the Jewish Church that spirit and it will pick up a Jew no there will be Moses Elijah there to introduce Christ to the Jews well here when he remembered his Covenant he will go for them that's why it has started now even Putin was pointing at Jerusalem saying I wonder he said I want that amen putting once the Tabernacles but the Bible says they will die in the mountains of Jerusalem that's the battle of Armageddon I mean that that that's Russia will invade Jerusalem but he says King of the North Carolina not Ukraine no it's something that political or something but the river has dried up for the king the king of the East to come down [Music] let us thank God that we won't be we will not be around amen [Applause] he won't allow his wife to go through these terrible time tribulation period is a terrible time it's a world without God Revelation 12 10. what did it says okay I I be closing now and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night right Revelation chapter 12 . he says there was war in heaven for more chapter 12. just call me is understand able rule Revelation chapter I'm talking about this one now it says read it chapter 12 verse 10. and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our thoughts down now is cast out of heaven now he says down now don't just end the time because it says it will say to those in heaven Rejoice that's today yeah continue what he says and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the weight of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death therefore Rejoice see heavens and he that dwell in them amen amen he says that that that's those after the Rapture rejoice foreign and now tribulation period is three and a half years each one yes he's three and a half now tribulation period which is three and a half years at that time it says rejoice [Music] [Applause] for the Devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he has but a short time yeah amen the Inhibitors of the earth and the sea yeah we won't talk about that [Music] you know we've been what are having things from the sea even pharaoh operated from the river yes and God said to Moses wake up early in the morning and go to the river before pharaoh then people before he start his things [Music] and God said go to the river before Pharaoh enters the water then [Music] We have dealt with such things [Music] you read it in the Bible you find God talking against the water gods come to close with Melchizedek here because he says are you ready to meet him now we are through here that the communion is part of himself not just a glass of wine no part of himself so that's why you you are you continue to pay your tithes because you started in Abraham paying your ties to melkisa [Applause] then along the way sometimes you say sometimes I'm up sometimes

this age mm-hmm yeah I was told that in a great place like America a child can leave home being a boy then arriving back from school he's again I'm not saying she's a girl but he is a girl mm-hmm things happening like that until they called America more than Sodom and Gomorrah means policemen were struggling with somebody there who had a t-shirt and at the back you read Jesus loves you and
