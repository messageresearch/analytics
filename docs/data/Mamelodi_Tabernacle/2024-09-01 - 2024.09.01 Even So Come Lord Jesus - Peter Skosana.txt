Description:
Title: Even So Come Lord Jesus
Text: The Translation of The Bride
Preached by Elder Peter Skosana at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 01 September 2024

Mark 15: 34 | Luke 22: 42-43 | Revelation 1:18 | Mark 14:34 | Revelation 3:20 | John 6:35,51,63 | 1 Samuel 18:1

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the translation of the bride and that even so lord Jesus come.

There are prophecies that has to do with the time we are living in, and we are chosen as the bride to manifest them. When Jesus was hanging on the cross, Christ was not there.

When Jesus was about to be crucified there were birth pains and the angel came and strengthen him. The rapture is about to take place and there should be birth pains.

The condition the world is in; no one can save the world. That is why we have to go. The mystery of God is when man and God are linked together. The new world has to be born, and there will be birth pains.

The true word of God must be manifested. God must become us and we must be Him. Within you there is a child without a human father. We have to recognise this child because he is the revelation of the word. He is the only one who can say come Lord Jesus.

The only thing that can help the world is the coming of the Lord. If you are the seed of Abraham, then you need to have a rapturing faith. 

You do not need an understanding but you need a revelation. There is no book written on how to receive a revelation, only at the right time you will receive it. God brought it in a way that the devil cannot get it. And you will also fail to explain it, because it comes in a channels of its own.

Our inheritance is Christ. You must know who you are and know who is with you. The revelation of the word is when you communicate with God soul to soul.

The elder read the following spoken words: 65-0124 Birth Pains Par 88 - 97
65-0221 Who Is This Melchisedek Par 54,65,160
63-0318 The First Seal Par 361-363

you okay Let's uh read from the book of uh Mark 15 I'd like us to read verse 34 Mark 15:34 and at the 9th hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Elo Elo l which is being interpreted my God my God why H has Thou forsaken me I would like us to go also to the Book of Luke read verse 42 and 43 L chapter 22 LCA 22 verse 42 and uh 43 Verse [Music] 42-43 saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from Heaven strengthening him uh the last scripture would be Revelation 1 verse 18 [Music] 18 I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death let let us bow our heads and pray gracious Lord yes we are together again am with our heads bowed Lord Almighty and our hearts lifted up unto thee looking back lord in our lives we could see your mercy and your Grace Hall how you took us Lord Al Mighty back there gracious Lord and let us crawl over until we reach Lord Almighty the highest part of our life we are here Lord Almighty because you were merciful to us you even predestinated us Lord and you commune with us Lord in a very special way hallu lot of things are hidden from from the wise and prudent but father you have revealed it unto us we are so grateful Lord Almighty because we're living at the end time lord of prophets and even Apostles wanted to see this time Lord to be Witnesses of the prophecies Lord amen but father we so you are so gracious to us that we are the last one Lord that are seeing things Lord thank you Father as we we're about to continue Lord with your fellowship amen we like to engage you Lord in what you are doing Amen Let everybody's heart Lord Almighty be together Amen Let the few verses that you have read Lord be expounded by you amen and it should find place in our hearts Lord we are so grateful Lord Almighty because you've given us power and you said you'll build your church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so we prevent the Gates of Hell from prevailing against this church in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ knowing Lord Almighty that our prayers will always reach you gracious Lord and father reaching you Lord being so merciful and you taking control of every situation amen we are here to hear from thee Lord may you visit each and every one of us Lord in a special way Lord father thank you in the name of my Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated God bless [Music] you the title will be even so come Lord Jesus now why we have chosen this title because it has to do with the time that we are living in uh it link family and closely and strongly yeah and with full awareness that we like each and everyone to be aware of what is going on and also be aware of the power that is in him are we together so that that lifs us up from being church goers and then we become the manifestors there are prophecies that has to do with the time that you are living in then we have been chosen as the bride to manifest those there are mysterious things that are revealed to us as the bride so now ours is to manifest those things that's why we are the bride and that is why God decided to reveal the we that's why the prophet say the word is now in the now uh I have read here a scripture Mark 1534 154 when our Lord Jesus Christ uh uh was uh on the cross hanging on the cross let me see let me say when Jesus hanging on the cross Christ was not there because if I say our Lord Jesus Christ I will be saying even Christ was crucified so it was Jesus the body so the Bible says at the nth hour Jesus you see cried with a loud voice saying which is being interpreted my God my God why has Thou forsaken me it means then Christ was no more there if you go to Mark 14 verse 34 my brother and read that for us and said unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death Terry ye here and watch you hear what he say he said his soul was exceedingly sorrowful that was before he was arrested now what what what I want to bring forth uh is that now the father was dwelling in our Lord Jesus Christ [Music] that very same father and then it was uh at the end time during that time was about to be crucified and then when he was about to be crucified there were birth pains he was supposed to have right amen now the prophet speaks about those best pains we have read about the birth pains when he was about to be crucified that there was an angel that appeared from Heaven to strengthen him now remember the Rapture is about to take place when the rapure is about to take place there should be bir pains see amen because I'll tell you why so I just want you to to be aware of the title because the text will be the translation the bride says even so come Lord Jesus we want to show the the the sorrow that is in the world and the threats that are in the world and that nobody can ever ever to save the world that is why we have to go because the the the level in which the world is in it seems to be a an improvement and it's technology is very high everything is but the world is about to explode you hear what I'm saying I say the world don't say the [Music] Earth is about to explode but then there's a part that was sorrowful to Jesus that we have read about but when you go to Revelation chap 1 verse 18 he says I am he that live right amen and was dead and behold I am alive for forever more that very same person who was saying Aloo so he says behold I am alive forever more and I even have the keys of hell and death when he was on the cross nobody could interpret him he was the only one that understand what is going on even even before he told his disciples that my heart is so sorrowful unto death because tonight I had to be arrested and then when he was saying that the disciples could not interpret that the only people that can interpret the world now it's you and me because we are chosen we see what is going on right the mystery of God is when men combine with God amen right amen they linked together now linking together of the bride and the groom brings about the Rapture because is the word giving birth to the word so now that is why I'm saying we should be strongly [Music] convinced why we are saying even so come Lord Jesus you know our our Lord Jesus Christ used to say my father dwelt in me speaking about the father that dwelt in him okay Amen Let us then continue uh I'm going to read Revelation 3 verse 20 remember the title is even so come Lord Jesus right now if if there's an overcomer then it should be somebody that has fought a battle you cannot be overcome if you haven't fought amen together amen now can you read uh that verse my brother Revelation chapter 3: 20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into to him and will s with him and he with me sub with him and he with him now when he says sub speaking about sa right amen now uh I didn't give the the technical team this code but they will just follow it I'm sorry about that amen there is a code in this bookan church h that one that hasn't got paragraphs now it says here now there is a great deal of confusion over the this verse that behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I me I will come into him and St with him now the prophet says there is a great deal confusion deal of confusion over this verse because so many people he says workers use it in personal evangelism as though Jesus was in their hearts door of every sinner knocking as though Jesus were at the doors of every sinner [Music] knocking knocking for admission it will be then he says it will then be said that if the sinner open the door the Lord will come in but he continues but this verse is not talking in talking to individual Sinners he says this whole message has a sumission as as does every message in every Church age right amen now he said this is the condition of the Lan church is as it and near towards the end of it is the condition of it it's not a personal message to one person it's the spirit telling us where Jesus is Christ has left the church you see amen Christ has left thean church that truth is that Jesus has been steadily pushed aside until the last age he's pushed outside the CH that that's what he says but now I want us uh that that is the message to the Church of the last age they've pushed Jesus out that is why is no more in the church because the Pentecostals uh have refused him are we together now let's continue now uh let's start by uh maybe checking what is happening in the world and then from there on we'll come to ourselves as a bride does this book birth pains pains let's start from paragraph 88 the prophet says here well if the world has if the world has to give way to the B of A New [Music] World are you aware there is a birth of the new world Amen in other words this world it's at the end [Applause] so that there there's a p pain a new world is about to and if a new world has to be born the prophet says you look at the the sequence of the pain the sequence of the bad pains he says even the doctor when the woman is going to give birth he he checks the sequence of the pain the the painful or the harder is the pain the near is the best now it says now the world is about to give birth of a new world let's just examine some of the bad [Music] pains we are having on Earth then you will see about what day and and and and just about how far she is along in her labor paragraph 89 says the first the first world war show great birth pains it shows one of the first that was the first one first B PS p Pains of going into labor because of that time for her we had brought forth the bombs machine guns poison gas that was during the first World War 194 1914 now those were the pains during that time maybe many of you cannot remember you said I was just a little boy of about 8 years old but I remember them speaking of this m and then he says how just looks like it just get started it's a pain but it's a small pain it's just a bomb machine guns poison gas chlorine gasas during that time it was a terrible thing that was the pains [Applause] paragraph 90 and we find out now we've had a second world war I'm not telling you about history compare it with the scriptures and then we know that the time that we are living in it has to do with the third pool it has to do with the revelation of the seven se but is to compare you the bride uh with what is happening in the world that you are living in together but you need to know those pains started from the first world war maybe we will continue here maybe let's have that screen I mean that uh slide that shows the the the different Idols yeah that one you you see it's about seven Church ages churches uh each and every Church age had an image chur an image uh which which which which is is an idol and they had also a temple in laia they had an image of Diana they had a temple where they worship Diana and differently you see all those images those were the idols that were woried in different cities but now God was showing that each and every age has God an idol a temple now let's go to ours the seventh [Music] one yeah how do you pronounce that I always say Z but I understand they said yeah Z or whatever it is you know that is the Devil Himself so which means during the devil will be worshiped right now you know very well that the law is not against you worshiping the dev and then is not even against you building a temple but if you could look what is happening in laia not with the bride inia the bride is not in the way we dress we we don't dress like you know we are living together but some in we have crossed over now now some are attracted by laisha they're dragging their feet some have already crossed last time I read you a code where the Prophet says it's for special people together now now you see now the the last Church age the king is the devil can I have that other slide just just to give you an example of of of of where we are remember now laia is the Devil Himself we waiting for the bride to go they are waiting for the bride to go so that they could do their things right the prophet here explain about the first three Church ages the first the second and the third that it was an antichrist as it continues it became the false prophet then as it continues it became a VI now in the it's a beast we are living in the time of the Beast but that piece will overl after the Rapture you will see the color of the beast but he has already here now when I'm talking about the Beast I'm not talking about the something that you can fear it I'm talking about the system it's it's it's beastly it's Canning are we together amen if you go to the Book of Revelation you will see in the first revelation 13 you'll see there is a beast that comes out of the water you go to verse 11 there's another Beast that but I'm not I'm not talking about that what I want to show you is that now the Bible when it says let he that is filthy be filthy still it is because we are at the end you know when Jesus Christ said the one that will dip the bread with me here it was at the end if you don't have the spirit of resistance there will be another spirit that will take your hand and you'll [Applause] deep even if you can say [Music] you see it will be now your soul be driving you are we together so now because that is the time of Separation right amen So You Don't Have To Cross I mean you don't have to remain behind you need to cross over right amen I was I was showing you the first world war and even the birth Pains of that the bir pains with that now poisonous things poison gases chlorines bombs that is why we say even so come Lord Jesus what you are seeing you won hide from now the second world war and her pains was much greater that one was bomb the first one poisons and but now it it says here the second world war and her pains was much greater more terrific all the time bir Pains of the earth she almost had to give way during the time of the atomic bomb because it will destroy a whole it was much greater than the Pains of the first world now uh paragraph 91 amen now she knows that her time of Deliverance is at hand the world knows that the time of Deliverance is at hand she must uh give birth to another world that's the reason she's so nervous we were living with people that are very nervous they are not settled they even take drugs do you know now that some of the drugs like dag has been legalized you can smoke until you are satisfied now your nerves because their nerves are are not in a stable condition he says they are so nervous they will take drugs to try and come their nerv they take they attacked by demons and then they they are given right to negotiate with the demons even at schools you cannot lay hand Upon a Child no lay hand in in terms of praying who is attacked by by an evil spirit they would say no it's an abuse that spirit is from their ancestors AB their ancestors to you is a demon you want to chase it to them it's a never system right amen it's towards the time of Deliverance remember Jesus when it was the time when now he had to deliver because the pleasure was very much was attacked left and right are we together until he said why did you leave me God will never leave you that is why there an angel from heaven that is why there is an angel from heaven are we together when when when brother Bram went to he met an angel and he would say this Angel is a human being he very nice he says I know him now speaking about Angel says I know him he's just a human being now you are waiting for a angel that will come flying that angel is the word of God that is in you but that word of God needs to be applied by a man like yourself the Bible said he became a man and then when he became a man and then that's why I said now the word will produce a weight in the end time the we give it birth to the we amen now the true word of God must be made flesh the true word of God God must become us and we must be him now within us we have a child without a human father within you there is a child without a human father you have to recognize that that child because it's the revelation of the word of that is the one that will say even so but your mind your way of living look at the world and it it will attract you but there's one within you that will see with another ey right now she knows that her time of Deliverance is at hand that's why she's so nervous FL because that there is an oxygen bomb it's no more just a bomb it's an oxygen bomb or I mean hydrogen H it's a there's misiles not machine gun I machine gun no there missiles and then there's Rockets rocket there's drones drone they don't run around with a with a gun they send a drone and control it if they want to destroy you they just a drone just an ordinary drone go through your window and explode so people are never there hydrogen bomb there missiles to destroy the world one nation is scared of the other one no matter how little it there's bomb all over you know about it they got those missiles they claim just one of them said they can direct them by the stars and drop them anywhere in the world so now in paragraph 93 he says people's science has broke into God's Great laboratory until they going to destroy themselves they want to create a human being or they want to create an animal now they are getting into God's Great laboratory they try cloning and doing all the the laboratory of God God just spoke the word and things came into existence amen now the world know knows that you must give way she knows that she must give way she cannot stand it in paragraph 95 he says so the world knows that her birth pains is so great she's going to give away there's going to be a new B at hand you see amen now if there's going to be a new BET at hand it's because the world must amen she's actually she's totally Wroten if you read paragraph 96 politics her systems the prophet says there's no sound bone in [Music] her the world system is Wroten to the call politics religious politics that's how it is there's only one thing that can help her that's the coming of the Lord so are you together so it's only the coming of the Lord that can help now how is it going to help us is that now we have to link family and the only way to link family is to have a ministry right amen the ministry of the time that we living and that Ministry is the revelation of the seven SE and the revelation of the seven seed it's Christ himself you are the Seed of Abraham being the Seed of Abraham in faith so then if you a Seed of Abraham in faith then you need to have a rapturing faith in you that's that's what we call a mystery it's a it's it's God and man combined they become one thing so now let's go to the book of of of of John chapter 6 Johan 6 let's go to verse 35 verse 35 but before before before we go to that one I I would like us to yeah but let's go to that one John 6:35 and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst amen then uh can you read 51 51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world now if that one you don't have to read I'll quote it if you you read you you read John 663 John 663 it says it is the spirit that quickeneth right the flesh profited nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are love says now the words that I speak unto you they are Spirit remember there was a time where he gave them bread and say they must eat then he said that is his flesh and gave them wine said they must drink that is his Spirit after that one day he said if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood then you are not worthy right amen and then he did not explain that you just leave that until some interpreted it wrongly okay it's not the first time that I'm telling you this the word of God when you read it the Bible says in Ephesians 1 17 it says that now God will give you a spirit and that spirit will be able to interpret what you've been reading about what what is important is that now you don't need an understanding you need a revelation now a revelation you get it from God are we together amen now when you read or when you sit down and listen to any preacher speaking there could be some other things that will go above your head that is why God gave us a spirit now that Spirit communicate with the spirit and even that verse whenever I preach I quote it in in in in in in in uh uh Romans 8:16 speaking about your spirit and his Spirit linking together right amen and then when it link together and then it it comes to a point like if you read who is this MC in paragraph 54 it says then the the attribute was first God he was God himself but but you miss that one and then you miss the godhead once you miss the godhead you are excommunicating yourself from that one because when when he was is going to say I and my father one then is you want to say again in that day you shall know then you'll have a problem to know because he says in that day you shall know that I am in the father now when he was in the father he was the only one that understand that he's in the father him and the father that is why whatever was doing he could not explain them he cannot explain how he walk upon the sea he cannot explain how he multiplied the bread because it was not yet time it's not science where you could say I've taken this and mix that one then Peter saw him walking upon the sea He said Come Peter and Peter walked upon the but because it was not yet time he started sinking then there was a time where he CED the sea now he cannot sit down and say if you want to come the se you must do 1 2 3 then when you receive a revelation there's no book that is written how to receive a revelation at its right time you will receive it that is why the Bible says that is your new name be known by you only now you have now a Supernatural understanding it won't be a normal one and the hidden part of it you cannot explain it to somebody else Paul went to heaven and came back and save for 14 years because he could not explain it to somebody are we together brother Bram brother went beyond the C of time and in coming back when he tried to explain you you will hear you will see it in portion you could not understand because you have to be there and you you have to have the quality of going there now the revelation of the word in you it should be you that knows it God reveals it but to you why because he gave it to Adam and the devil wanted to take it so God took it back to himself when took it back to himself he brought it in a way that the devil cannot C because it must go directly to you and you must fail to explain to somebody because it has got its own channel whoever wants it must get to that channel and that channel is the seventh scene you reject because that seven SE is Christ himself the mystery it's of Christ now if you want to know it you must be Christ right and Christ must be you I that's why I always say Abraham abah became Elohim Elohim became himself brother Bram saw a notable one he became that notable that not when they say it flew into him it's not physically no he became that angel that angel became himself now how are you going to explain that if I'm going to say I became God and God became myself you going to take me to definitely because you still see God as another being you don't see him potentially that he is a man and is in you now the problem is God goes to man and the man uh Retreats because he says God is so great that is why here now Philip said show us the father when he said show us the father uh brother Bram explained that I I'll get you that that good because if you could uh read about Elijah and Elish as as they were going Elisha was gunning or he was enticed or was attracted by what was in Elijah that is why he says uh it speaks about the the S I speaking about the soul because he would say as the Lord leaveth and my soul or your soul you see he's speaking about this there's something that was attracting now he kept on following until that very same thing flew into him he became that thing when he came back he was he was now the very same thing that he was following am now how if you look at the church ages there is no period that is like this one and there will never be a period after that that will be like this one there is nobody there is no other bride that will come next time the bright is this one are you two together amen now now he is is speaking here about that we we we we are the attributes now if we are the attributes let me read you something that you you you you you already know attributes the final end when Abraham met him he was m he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the Final End every son of Abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing right amen the church has got its last sign it says and the church has got its last sign before the whole world is going to be destroyed this Gentile Kingdom be destroyed by fire and Roth of God that's what he says but what I want to read to you is is how he processed himself of of which you know that that now there is a way in which he processed himself just looking for that book right now there is a way in which he process himself mind you we said now Christ has left the church and when Christ has left the church so the church can never be right and until uh Rapture now we got a promised son ourself I want to read you about that there's something that has been promised here it's it's your son which is your Revelation let's read the book of 1 Samuel 18:1 verse one 1 Samuel 18 verse one and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul that the spirit the soul of Jonathan was snit with the soul of David and Jonathan loved him as his own soul amen yeah here here the Bible speaks about the two Souls the soul of David and the soul of Jonathan they they came together and became one thing now if these Souls came together I'm just giving you an example your soul and the soul of God have to come together and become one thing when we say you are a potential God we're referring to your soul is of god remember when God formed the Men Out of the Dust of the earth he gave that man Life by by by by by uh uh uh through the spirit are we together then after that God took his own soul and gave it to Adam the soul of Adam and the soul of became one thing that is why now God I mean Adam Adam was operating from that level he he can call things into existence can shift Rivers into different direction but the Bible says the evening time God will visit his son Abraham was God Adam was God yeah I mean sorry God was God and and and Adam was we had two of them the other one is the Father the other one is the son but God took everything and gave it to his son are together amen and then Abraham could do that it's exactly what is happening with us God took everything and gave it to us in Romans 8 in verse 19 verse the Bible says speaks about the creatures that are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God waiting for the manifestation waiting for us to receive our inheritance and what is our inheritance our inheritance is Christ and if our inheritance is of our inheritance is Christ that's what the creature is waiting [Music] for because the present world is an operation to them right yeah he says this spoken the first [Music] C paragraph 361 I'm I'm closing now notice at the end time at the end of the church ages now he and his children are called the Antichrist because anything that's against Christ Antichrist and anything is against the word is against Christ because Christ is called the we now paragraph 36 says when Satan is cast out which is which is the accuser you want to put that down that's what he says the devil which is up there now accuser of our Brethren when the church is taken up and Satan is cast out and when the church goes up Satan comes down and Satan incarnate himself in the Antichrist which is called Beast you hear what is going on now there is a birth paint we have to change our bodies and here on Earth the angels of the devil are already already here you heard about the river and at the same time the investigating angel of God are already here together now the angels that bound on the river euphrat already started are we together now the best pains that you see in the world are not done by human beings B by the angels of the dev the Prophet The Prophet says in the second world war it was those spirits that were in the river euph were released tempor not all of them if you could see the bombs that are flying if you could see the killings that are going on see that these things are demonic it's demonic demon now it's the birth pains and now if there is the the angel of the devil absolutely they should be the angel of [Applause] God no you you you you you must be aware that always there is an angel that is with you don't imagine it it is there because that that angel it has to take care of you and the Bible says the angel of the Lord is [Music] encamping are we together that is why now we say even so come you see what mood is doing who knows who is when when when when when when when uh God want to destroy a place he send he's in control of all the waters during the time of Noah was look at what is going on with water say he is around you that is the destructive Angel no you must be aware that if the world is like this God won't be sitting on a rocking chair if God is not under the rocking chair something that shakes you you can relax you must know who you are and you must know who is with you don't worry about the other things let life go on as normal must know who you are are we together now you must know that whoever touches you he touches the wrong person [Applause] and you must know that you communicate with your God you speak with your God just like you are the Seed of Abraham Abraham abrah spoke with God mouth to mouth are you together if your father Abraham did that then in our time it's not mouth to mouth revelation of the word is when you communicate with God Spirit to Spirit soul to soul are you together the old test is the shadow of the new test when David and Jonathan their souls were were combined Jonathan Jonathan became David became Jonathan and Jonathan took out his cloth take his sword and give it to David so that he could take the one that belongs to David he said now you are me I am that is exactly what's going on you are God he is God he has given you that sword which is the word of God you have given your heart that's where your strength is that's how it is now we are at the vge of the time God speaks most to with when when when you speak you know that my father hears me don't expect a physical response you must know your word is heavy when you say to the devil get out of here know you so you are a potential God are we together so may our Lord help [Applause] us am
