Revelation chapter 4 is from verse 1 to 5. every single color we understand I don't know whether um I believe the system that is English do we need also Swati says how do you read it every Sunday yeah right God bless you yes after this I looked and before a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a champion talking with me which said come up hither and I will show you things which must be here after and immediately I was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that said was to look upon like a Jasper and a sudden stone and there was a rainbow found above the throne inside like Andrew and emerald and out about the throne were Four and Twenty seats and upon the Seas and saw Four and Twenty Elder City and out of the throne proceeded Lightnings and thunderous and voices and there were seven lengths of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God okay and Revelation chapter 5 now oh sorry sorry um [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to do their own and I worked much because no man was called waiting to open and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders said unto me with no Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven cells thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne amen sambulon chapter 5 verse 1 to 7. foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] amen you may be seated God bless you and we are going to pick up some spiritual points yeah [Music] in preparation for what God will uh give to us tomorrow if there will be any tomorrow foreign firstly let me read you know the Book of John chapter 4 verse 1. [Music] yeah that is a sales page 19. um in this series now you'll check in your book from which page do you find this part here let me go back there I don't really move where is the book now to its original owner is now we find out where is the book now material to its original owner now this message was not preached today amen amen but was preached back there since then we've gone past the seventh Church age we have passed she went to Lily all right so now we are here now now chapter four such was a scene uh and John in the spirit standing here in heaven he has been lifted up now from the church ages and John was privileged amen when at the Isle of Patmos after springing the facts as a Patmos he was lifted up now you know sometimes brother Brennan would say the angel picked me up um now people think that John was lifted up Flying high in the skies no the John that was lifted up is the theophany of joy uh hallelujah amen now I read oh I think today you will listen to this scripture John in the spirit standing here in heaven he has just been lifted up from the church ages now this is not coming from the church ages because he has just been lifted now you can hear this from the church ages or from any being siding in the church through the church ages Andy John saw the church ages foreign [Music] so that's why he was lifted up from the [Music] um then it says again he said now come higher yeah I'm going to show you things that will come on not from the ages not from the ages um shall we repeat this one I don't know whether it's a reputation or what Revelation chapter 21. verse 9. verse 9. and they came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven virus full of the seven last names and talk with me say come hither I will show Thee the bright the lamps one okay and remain Oh I thought you were standing hmm come here boyana okay amen and I will show you ending only if you can come um if you don't come you won't see it but you should come here then I will show you emperor you know how that's how the message unfolding it is in some dimensions [Music] in some spheres can hear one here and failed to hear the next chapter now so that's why God has to lift up John um if he is not lifted up he will not be able to hear what follows even today if we are not lifted up um we will remain in the same place we will remain in the same place if we are not lifted up um Jesus Christ after his death Resurrection he was lifted up higher to the highest level wow and started to speak to his bride from there that's why this afternoon we need to be lifted up if it doesn't happen to us yet um we can't remain even at school you know you can't remain in a grade A forever not if you are lifted up the subjects also change opportunity [Music] of now listen then I wonder since you came so away that since you were baptized you were prayed for what are you can you come with a testimony foreign [Music] what he does with his we have a we have a trial we are he lifted them up [Music] listen then come up higher I'm going to show you what you can see unless you are lifted up amen now I I continue then he saw the one set upon a throne and it's not just a scripture [Music] come up here and I will show you the the bride [Music] amen amen and then what happened what happened I will show you the bride and after that what happened Carry Me Away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God amen only from that place is all right amen so you see that's why I for few minutes will look at it then the Lord willing we will get into it because no but myself I always tell myself I can't remain in one place something that is not moving on amen it will start fulfill for a short time discussion and realization you can enjoy or think that you have started if you don't move to the next that thing starts to rotating and next time all things you have left behind assembly They Come and catch up with you there the children of Israel when they arrive in the Red Sea um and they started to um murmur and they practiced against Moses so God said to Moses Moses Moses tell the children of Israel go forward did you read that scripture he never said tell them to fast to pray there's a Time need to fast and pray we need to move amen some people they remain fasting praying fasting residing in one place amen I believe I was with Barbies course she had some bottles from her prophet now I said to her nothing is good sister you are suffering that's right but we are going to church you receive some bottles of oil but the condition Remains the Same tell you the reason why amen amen and I'll tell you what to do yeah you know the children of Israel they were in Egypt praying there couldn't help them they were supposed to move amen amen and any Moses God said to Moses tell them to do what um to go forward amen amen because they are in their own territory they are in the wrong place persons are waiting they are praying in the wrong place but friends worshiping in their own place abundance when they're wrong and there's no spiritual results [Music] to go forward because they had three stages of the journey out of Egypt [Music] there was three stages of their Ministry we have three stages of our ministry the first pool um if it is going nowhere and the church is inside the church politics so tell them Moses to go forward better than a puppy amen and before them there was the sea Red Sea and there was still the wilderness amen amen okay No Moses with the Lord of God um foreign he led them what a hole now you must always remember the song is as they started on the dry ground s after the sea opened up amen amen because Jordan saw them but in the sea Godfather could not recognize pharaoh so they cross over to the other side because amen amen the sea recognizes them because they were under the leadership of the creator of the sea wow you must go in the place where he don't just walk [Applause] don't just walk in don't just walk listen to the seventh angel messenger before you start working [Applause] Hallelujah they see recognized them foreign [Music] in respect of the crossing seed of God [Music] The Crossing seed of God the seed s and then what happened the water a man is subsided Pharaoh also thought that if they can walk on the dry land [Music] um we also can walk on there what not Islam um that's how the devil is who compel the mountains beware when you say we are saved look behind foreign when they were just about to arrive at the other side the sea looked behind and saw Pharaoh yeah and could not recognize pharaoh just closed [Applause] amen amen now when they were on the other side yes but the Bible said unbelief foreign believer [Music] they thought they were safe see you hey we have made it we are on the other side of the sea Italian enemy now worked from there inside the enemy worked inwardly in the wilderness that's how it is happening foreign like brother Brennan says Satan don't understand the third [Applause] pools always let alone sing it he doesn't understand it amen amen it is a Satan free ministry [Applause] [Applause] right yeah man meetings without the sugar added sugar-free yeah now we need a Satan free ministry so [Applause] enough [Music] always you must say Satan free ministry foreign the sweetened one we cook will cause what in yeah sugar disease [Applause] [Music] you can enjoy it yeah but after that you won't enjoy diabetes and Satan is just like that so now second Saturday like you know I've been talking about things called Instagram Instagram you know the people hang their children there fore and the people the support they want to be seen of men bags you have them everywhere sometimes you look at in Instagram [Music] is that the third pool no it's Instagram foreign they want to be seen of men of course brother Brennan says a God don't look at you he looks at Christ [Applause] now that's why the people they want they don't want to be seen in that set pool of God people don't want to be seen of God no that's why they go for Radha for Instagram dress to kill and do what and all that is foreign speaks something there oh prophet he says when God look at the man inside of that man he has created [Music] that man inside looked like him [Applause] so he he says I mean God don't look at you he looks at Christ so if the sin of God um that's when he sees you in Christ because he said let us make men in our image so when he looks at the man he's looking at his own [Applause] um [Music] you understand if you want God to look at you um that's when you want God to look at himself foreign now we are going to read a bit and close we would have done the part that that will lead us to the rest is okay amen now let's follow this we understand that from the church [Music] we will read this part in the next few hours meaning tomorrow if there will be a tomorrow we will look at these things do you still remember that part Liang let's start with this one Revelation chapter 12. some roses verse one now chapter 4 we will read of what is happening there you see the cabinet of God disappearing and all that sisters then chapter five verse Islam because the prophet of God says the first Throne was in heaven amen [Music] you know it reminds me of Philip so um while he was stoned Stevens Stephen my Prophet says he felt no stone because no Heaven opened lovely he looked through the channel [Applause] he felt not even a stone now when this channel is open to us of how it opened to the stewards we feel no problems [Music] you see I don't have any enemy [Music] you know when when heaven and hope to you um start looking into heaven Jesus when he was betrayed he was not looking at the betrayers no because that was the plan of redemption uh what human what as mentioned that's right amen forfeited the book what now it moved to God one one thing because that book we are coming to that book it is called the title deed of redemption [Music] [Applause] that's why John saw the one who sat on the throne after he saw the cabinet and so forth we still we will still read that but Revelation 5. then he saw the one outside on the throne with the book in his right hand what is okay amen so on the right hand side foreign was in the hands of Adam yes if you go back you find that there is Eden um now God was the god of air Eden um and Adam the god of the earth don't doubt it because I'm going to read it out of the spoken word Adam was made a god [Applause] that's why we were attacked Sasha said when we said we are a major gods NASCAR City where is this from foreign because God been the god of the universe and the Eden was his headquarters he gave him that part which is the Garden of Eden Adam then he gave him the title the Dig is you are going to find it here in your books when he received the book yes uh Satan was the Hindi related man of God yes according to the word here in the spoken word then foreign which is on Earth it is called the battle of Armageddon see his church foreign [Music] [Applause] after years dusted of the Dust is foreign because Adam was the god of the of the Earth God made him the god of the Earth that's why he gave him the title deed the manual book [Music] s okay yes no that's why it says what does abstract mean foreign that was in the hands of Adam what does the beginning amen amen and that's how Adam was when he forfeited they forfeited the title did they went back to the original owner now it was in the hands of the original owner here almighty God because it came from here to us God been the god of the universe he honored his son with a title deity amen amen now he says it went back to the ones Adam let's go to other forfeited it went back almighty God because my name or and your name is in that book [Applause] and God wouldn't let Satan oh see what's in the book eternity God wouldn't let Satan see the content means [Applause] but when the devil for when you forfeited it [Music] that's why he is called the prince [Applause] again called the God of this world Satan is called the God of this world is that's why the Bible says we we are not of this world [Applause] the world is a system [Music] they are not of this world praying for us he said [Applause] because there is Psalms 90 says God formed the world and the Earth you have the world foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] after God took back the title because Satan was coming for that thank you but God took it back again because he was weak now why is so weak and gives God we didn't let foreign [Music] [Applause] amen amen amen before you can say this is my house you need right now you can't claim it unless you are in possession of the Titan Deeds did you see how God rushed to take the book and then Satan started to introduce their world this is the system is System of politics [Music] denominationalism and all those things if he won't mind if we build churches it Satan don't do mine as long as we do that in the world [Music] because after um [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] is getting happy yeah let's enjoy the god of God separated us from this let me read you something here quickly then I close so far but we are coming back to the right hand then you realize the people of God are the right-handed people because the Mysteries came down from the right hand side the Lord after his death is resurrection he said on the right hand of the Majesty now that's right that's why we the right-handed remain on the right hand side because the book on the right hand side who came from the right hand side yes okay baby I don't know where's that time for me it doesn't exist God bless
