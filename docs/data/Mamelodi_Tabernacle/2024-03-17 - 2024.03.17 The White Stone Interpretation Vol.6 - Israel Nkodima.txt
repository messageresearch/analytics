Description:
Title: The White Stone Interpretation vol.6
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 23 March 2024.

Text :The pyramid of the white rock

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Revelation 2:17
Revelation 19:11-14
Revelation 12:12
I John 3:2
Revelation 3:20

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the White stone interpretation.

You have heard from your theophany, you are not going to hear. Before God put you in the body there was a theophany, which is the body subject to the word of God. Without Him we can do nothing. When God speak about a man, He doesn't count the years.

The stone in you which is called a theophany, it does not have years. What you know is what is put in you and not what is in the book. 

The theophany is the only one that can keep the word of God, because it is the word. 

Abraham when looking for a city he was not just looking but started walking to the city. Elijah knowing the chariot was coming he started walking towards the chariot. Enoch seeing that the rapture is coming he started walking. The sign that Enoch was going was the pyramid. The sign that the children of God are going is the ministry of the pyramid.

When you please God you will be taken away by God and not by death. Because the Bible says when you believe you shall not see death. 

A child of God is like a pyramid, and he has a white stone inside him/her which is a theophany. A church is not a society, to bury you. You go to church for to worship. 

God’s word is eternal and can only dwell in eternity. An eternal being cannot live in something that is not eternal. The word of God cannot survive in me if I do not have an eternal theophany. God does not force himself in the people, He comes to His place. That is why it says your body is the temple of God. He has prepared a place in you. When He comes to you, it is to the place that He has prepared for himself.

dream we will follow these things because the message now has gone beyond uh the church ages do you do you know thaten okay I was reading something here uh it says you have heard from [Music] your and another one says uh your body you all know what is the amen amen because you have a body that is subject to the word of God this other [Music] body and all that it's [Music] just amen amen but if we don't have the we lack we are behind because you we don't have a body like if we don't have you can't you can't take the word of God that's why it says you have heard not you are going to hear and you have heard from your it's something your hearing there's different kinds of Senses there's hearing of this ears now with your brain and all that now that cannot receive the word of God why before God could put you into a body what we call there was what is called the theop theop amen amen amen the body it is called a body subject to the word of God all right amen now let's read this just for H looking at the interpretation of the white Stone last night we were talking with the brothers as we were going through some things amen amen and uh we realized that we're asking looking for the answer from God because today we do need a supernatural answer amen the whole world is so confused with all its education systems we are building big universities and so but it seems that we are going amen amen we need somebody but that somebody is the one who was there before before your existence because without him we don't exist that's why he said besides me you cannot do anything amen you know if we were to believe God we would know that without him myself I I know I know that without him I'm nothing that's why he said You shall live because I live I am the life amen amen can you buy Life somewhere the Lord Jesus says because I live you shall live because he he is life he is our life amen amen all right now let's look at this I was asking a question again uh who's going to fight the ble of with the brothers yesterday because it says uh if I will come to that if time it says you have heard from your the that's why you see this white stone well there's so many pyramids in the world but there one that is called the Pyramid of the white stone amen amen and they realized that um in that pyramid of the white sto can I read to you this amen you know a stone you know I was looking at that those men from outer space so for H we were told that those Americans with their Apollo they they came with nothing actually but because a stone has got they tell you that this stone is so so so so many years old you ask how do you know they say because of the layers found in that amen amen amen like with with you when God speaks of a man he doesn't count your years if a child is born today they start counting here the parents predictions are made we want him to be we want him to be this and that and others they know better than that we want we want him to be a doctor if the lordes others they just say we just want him to be a doctor amen amen amen you know there's only one true uh prediction the one that was made by Jesus Christ amen our predictions uh I I I told you even before that even if you buy a car you need insurance insurance insurance them CER trer GPS what for because you know that this thing is at it is at its end when a child is born you know the first thing is predictions we want this child to be this but what they want uh leave behind is the burial Society meaning that this child according to them the child is born to die okay amen all right amen now let's look at this uh you yourself you cannot give yourself life amen is that right amen that's why we were talking a person buys a car when he finish say no no no no this car cannot go out without people must must strengthen it people but still cars and now we must find a person to really amen but they drive the car brand new car they go to a person without a car Amen in his of his level just busy cleaning his Bon they we want you to keep this for us can a person without a car keep your car safe answer me he's also looking for a car now you come with he can keep it safe but he doesn't have one he's also looking for one one man we had visited him they stole close to 42 goats now he tells us that I saw one man I went to him to say please keep this goat safe for me I said now this man was he having goats yeah I asked him I asked him that question he said no no he says now they he says no no that man is actually keeping them for you amen he keep goats for you when he himself has no goats that's the way he will keep them for you then you were saying no they are lost I was with the now we are surprised this man has no [Music] sing has no goat but this one is bringing his goats he says keep these goats safe for me you take without a car you say keep this car yes he's going to keep it for you right now let's look at this the white stone let me read to you first this type of a thing and there still a a long journey to take with this those men we are told that H they visited the moon and uh since they couldn't bring something here we told that they came back with a stone and they called that stone theck amen amen because a stone has got some layers now they count then they tell you that this stone is so so so all right amen but with you there's a stone in you amen called the that one has got no years it's a a theop but this body has got years amen amen amen I don't know as a human being with boast I you you remember leand do you remember that talk a brother was going taking some rounds you know thinking about future I want to do this and then he arrived at the cemeter and he was disappointed he was friend of mine yeah only he is late and he came to my house he told me that do the people in m know that this life is not forever then he says you know I was so disappointed while I was making some H predictions going that way actually he was driving a car when he Lo looked at the Graves he said Is this where I'm coming amen amen now all those predictions he made and they was thinking of they vanished being discouraged by the graves and then with some he was born in 19 so and passed away now this brother of mine got so much disc said but what am I living for because I'm going to end up here but now a Christian do not end up there if you are a Christian you don't end up there even if you are not a Christian you don't end up there either you're going to judgment or you are going back home where you came from amen amen so now uh and that gave me something to think about the brother is discouraged and he was discouraged because he saw the grave and he thought he was thinking of all the things he was trying to achieve after after all that after all the efforts am I coming there a quiet place amen amen all right amen now I said my my my my friend that's why the Bible says if you believe in God you have eternal life amen amen amen if you believe in God not not ancors God the creator of Heaven and Earth where were at that time in the beginning was the way amen and the word was now you follow it he came as a in the form of a man when they killed him on the third day he was back on duty because they killed the but not not God you can't kill the Lord Jesus Christ you can kill the body but in 3 days he was back with his followers he that was dead is now alive that's what he came for to give you eternal life amen amen because he says if you believe in him you shall never see death amen okay now did you hear that scripture if you believe in him you shall never see death death means separation now if you are a child of God you only will separate with this body but not with God Amen okay amen you know that day we tried to look into this this things ancestors when Jesus rose from the dead what happened the Bible says all other the graves were open when Jesus rose from the de the grace opened amen at that time amen so the Dead Rose from death amen amen amen and because he is is the resurrection amen you know that's why we told you that uh Jesus when he arrives at the funeral of Lazarus what did he say Mar said Lord if you have been here Lazarus would not be dead amen Jesus said Lazarus Lazarus Lazarus he's not judge he will he will wake up amen he's asleep you know when he introduced death of the disciples he said Lazarus amen but but know Lord but then they said Lord if he's asleep then he will wake up you know amen because he was the resurrection now how can the resurrection attend a funeral so he went show show me why you have laid now that was the resurrection walking and talking coming to his friends all right am now when he arrived there and he passed Mara trying to you know my mother used to take me to some places when maybe somebody has passed on then I used to dodge her because we would arrive at the place and uh they put us in a special room with all old Mas on the mades amen amen then there's one special one there then my mother you know he knew about this now what are you telling us now there is this special one he says oh M justed onday complaining about headache amen amen now when I when I get a chance I would just and run to the car so it will just continue like that until my mother one day he said to my elder brother you and your [Music] brother referring to me my mother said to my elder brother afraid of death even when you're not touched all right now let's pass this feral let's come here the white stone now this astronauts asona um they thought that the only thing we can uh show to the people from the unknown Moon because they have never been there now afterwards I know there were stories that they didn't really reach the mo this is just a type let's have something to introduce and they came with a stone now I read here that you will be given a name a white stone and what what continue in the stone a name written a stone written a name written in the stone continue which no man knoweth said saing he that receiveth it right amen I know I know that name which no men know but you [Music] yourself amen is that right amen we'll come to that but now I was looking at this part also here a special name which know it but you you know that in you there is something amen am you can compromise on many things but not on this special thing you know that's why when talking about hearing you have heard from your amen one would ask that woman i' I've heard you say I know I know what the Messiah is coming how did she know amen because the others didn't know all right amen some they they could say to her H yeah I have read the Bible it says Messiah is coming but now she says I know you see it's a different thing from some somebody who says the Bible says Messiah is coming this one is very personal I know how do you know amen amen so so as we are here each and every one of us here know something beautiful amen amen you know that that's like a white [Music] Stone now we here don't worry we are still going to run this in series yeah because anyhow we have passed the seven Church ages we are beyond that if you go beyond that because seven Church ages speak of time now if you go beyond time uh now what you know is something that was put in you not in the book you remain with something special amen you know that that woman was not going around opening the Bible the Bible says Mah is coming no she became an announcer this coming messah I you know it must come to where you can [Music] say when it is now in you amen all right amen now and then yeah I was reading this P we still going to amen carry on Amen because this morning we were asking we're talking about this thing that Revelation Chapter 2 19 oh Chapter 19 Verse 11 vers 11 it says and I saw heaven open it's something special and when ask people what do you see say I just see clouds but this one says Heaven open and behold a white horse because we are told that white is the original color white horse and he that set upon him was called faithful true in righteousness he does Judge any this man was looking at that he saw that his eyes were as flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself we will we are going to follow these things to your name known only to you known only by you amen amen and then he said and he was cluth with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God amen amen now the word of God this is I've got a Bible here and we say this is the word of God but there is the word of God Amen not in letter form is that right amen this is in letter form you can read it and then afterwards you get offended by it but there is the word of God amen now that one you cannot because pass it that's why they say theop is a body a body subject to the word of God there's no faculty in you that can keep the word of God but it is only your theop amen now if you don't have the you can hear the word been preached but you can't keep it because it is only the keep the way because the itself is the way okay now listen here says his eyes were a flame of and on his head were many crowns he had a name written that no man knew but he himself all right amen and he was cloth with vure de in Blood and his name is called the word of God amen amen yeah we are looking at the Bible with some letters and we say it is the word of God but here we are looking at the word of God his name called the name the word of God Amen all right amen now you can keep the word of God only can keep the word of God Amen because in your body there some lust and all those things the word can live in that condition if it is the word of God all these others die all right am no last amen wherever you are going you are singing you know they were telling me last night [Music] that say you forward this Rapture thing we know yes not the way you are are like it's too it's too rush why no he has a problem with the Rapture it's not ready at all you know I'll tell you there are people living here that are willing to go because this world is not their home they are pilgrims and soers amen am longing [Music] fors we'll take it from the book of Hebrews like Abraham looking for a city then he was not just looking for it he started off to the city Elijah after he has seen a chariot coming he started walking Enoch seeing the Rapture coming he started working and the Bible says walked with God and he was not for God took him because he pleased God Amen in pleasing God you'll end up being taken away by God himself not by death for if you believe the Bible says you shall never see how many believe that scripture you shall never see all right amen because in you there's a white stone we are just thinking of home [Music] going now Abraham Abraham he met MC he was introduced to the king of the city to come we are coming there we are laying that a foundation because the bride is like a city I was reading where the prophet of God says we are still coming the bride is like a pyramid that is the bride we are coming to the pyramid amen amen and Enoch en he believ God and then the sign that he was going was the structure the pyramid the people that are going now amen their names are in the Lamb's Book that's why your ministry now is the pyramid pyramid amen because it's a sign of those that are living you shall take that form first because it says the a child of God is like a pyramid in in this child of God there is a white stone which we call amen so it says now as I'm closing it says and verse 13 and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clo in fining white and clean brother are you able to show us those who were in heaven and they will come with him also it says and the armies which were [Music] in do you know that there is an Army in heaven followed him upon white the original color white hes clothing fin white and clean now there's a white stone in them if you are a child of God you are there's something in you Hallelujah the word you know the Samaritan woman didn't say hey I'm from the church and they told me that Messiah is coming that was from the White St she said I know Messiah is coming she didn't say I he the pastor preaching no that was in hand because the word of God you can't just walk by saying I he the preacher saying I must pay my tit I must do this I must it is something that is already in amen amen we'll come to a similar things of something that is already in you you know the people like this one saying you talking too much about the Rapture uh he could say to this woman every time every time someone meets you you say I know also go to church but who is not a church this one this woman has a so that's why she says that mesiah she was not talking about the quotation I heard a preacher saying but now she says I that's when you have a stone you know yourself you yourself know that Messiah is coming now it says and the armies which were in heaven followed him now let me say who know can you tell of these armies which were in heaven and followed him upon [Music] white amen amen and because we know that white is the original amen CL in [Music] L white and clean all right amen okay before we close for we will come back for the White story you you see you see job I mean Enoch Enoch yeah the Bible says he walked with God and if you know we want to know what type of a person is that one you look at the people he [Music] he Associated yes the people associes with the I have heard this even from the prophet not once saying you don't have to look for some something in order to know the type what type of man is [Music] this just see the people he associat and you'll know that he is this type of a [Music] person and the armies which in heaven for amen it said we will follow him we will follow Jesus everywhere he goes it's something like this if you have that stone in you you want say to the Lord Jesus are [Music] we that's why speaks of Enoch after he arrived now uh he took a journey with the Lord himself he was already Amen on the Run Runway amen you know there's some people today already on the Run they don't know of any future because already they have arrived so they are working the brother uh I think he will continue to sing the last mile of the way the way amen I was listening when you sing it w be long told there then I said to myself are real [Music] people like our brother was talking to a certain sister when they when they away to work in the train now he was trying to H he was trying to H testify to the syst and said no we also know about God I also go to church you know church as a society amen it's life is not a society but it is life amen I go to church it will bury [Music] me you don't go to church so that you can be buried you go there to worship we are more amen amen and now while the brother was testifying to she said no we all know that the Lord Jesus is coming but you are too much I said to the brother with two different natures this one is just a church if you want to test he tells you that when I was spe you are too much meaning that just talk about it just say Jesus is coming don't be too too much on it finally to come back to I'm this so that you can come back and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clo in fine linen white and death clean these people were once here on Earth and they were taken up in the Rapture and at that day they will arrive back to fight what you call these are armies to fight the battle of here it shows when they shall come back toight brother where you know the brother knows where they areen just read it out there and I I'm closing but let's they not willing and if he carries will come back to talk about the white Stone are in heaven Revelation 12:2 therefore Rejoice ye heavens and he that dwell in them who to the Inhibitors of the earth and of the sea all right amen the it is referring to the people dwelling with in heaven and the people Inhibitors of the Earth the sea now they dwell in heaven where are they from now when we read there now this very same army they died and they are in that position you know I can repeat for last minute that when the Lord died and the Bible says he rose again on the but when he resurrected the graves were open that is his power of the resurrection and the did came out you know you were told that when he left ascended up that cloud was The Souls of those that resurrected amen amen now these are called armies which were in heaven they were here on Earth and they were taken up you know it says when he rose again they rose again amen amen amen that's what the Bible says when we shall come we shall be like him you know right now you don't see our true colors but when he shall appear we shall be like him that's our True Colors hey what does that mean meaning that when he shall appear it says we shall see him as he is meaning that you know him because if you know him then you shall see him as he is [Applause] that would mean that even now you know him you can't worship a God you don't know all right am they followed you now you see that scripture says they were where of heaven but they were men like us they were on but after they were raptured the Bible says they were in heaven am that's it amen and then they they were nowy an army now I'm closing here we were to this morning about this that which armies are going to get engaged in the battle ofon you know some look this way some look that way we are going to follow it why the only body in you that can catch this these things you know we you can repeat it time and again but it will never find a place because there's no place for it in that particular person the Lord Jesus said to thees he said my way has no place meaning that you are a place either in you because if he says my word has got no place in you that's finish because if there's a place for his word his word is eternal and can only dwell in eternity amen amen amen and in eternal being cannot live in something that is not it can survive the word of God cannot survive in me I don't have an eternal f for because it is eternal it can only dwell in so that's why your body people of God God can come in you because in you there's a place for you amen there's a throne in you now when he comes to you God Don't force himself into he comes to his place he has prepared that place for himself now when he comes to you he comes to take his place that's why I stand at the door and knock now listen he says and if any man hear my voice I shall come am you you can open we are coming back I will check that that he should come in [Music] fully if you are you you believe God like people say also believe the word of God because he is the word of [Music] God now if you believe him you believe him because you have believed him already yes he has prepared a place in you before when he comes to you OCC he just comes to a place that he has already when he died for you he he didn't die for you thinking that maybe you'll become a righteous person uhuh now he died for you because he had prepared that place for you now he died at the cross so that you can take his form amen so that he can in you lastly I'm down here you remember that story that man for to build a bridge oh that scientist that yes you know I repeat this thing because it's a true story some came before and they couldn't take the job because uh it is at the at the sea water now they said the job is for one who can build a bridge across that stretch now all the other Architects they failed then Here Comes This one and he also he knew about the others the others came and failed then he knew the secret amen amen he started he said I will take the job and then you know if you come to a place where some other people have failed you get discouraged they we also failed there we were looking for work there mean how can you build a bridge it sent all over down [Music] there now it says I won't read Now read next but he says the man said I know and in his heart he had White Stone because he knew that there must be a rock down there because you can build on Sand before he even started he was encouraged by the fact that he knew that there's a rock there we are trying like this we believe because we know there is heaven we know that the world will come to the end we know that we will be raptured amen amen and so he knew that the word there's a rock am and he started to go down with his machines until he arrived at the rock some others they could couldn't reach that place if you are a Christian you need Amen to go Beyond you go beyond the place where the people have failed a Christian is a person he can meet he can meet you after you have failed you are coming this way then he's going that way amen amen amen Christian it's fine I know there must be amen amen the master can't say to me build a bridge unless there's a rock down there that's why the people some meet some coming from with others going for and to the same place right because this one knows that there must be a rock down there now he until he arrives at the that the Sun and he knew that many died here many have failed here then he started knowing that there must be a rock Beyond this how many times you come to a place when other people tells you I also tried and failed but somebody comes but another one just right where you face he starts right there amen he goes beyond that line and that a lot of people fed he knew there must be a so he started from there and until he arrived at the amen amen then he started to work there singing Rock of Ages let for me let me myself in let the
