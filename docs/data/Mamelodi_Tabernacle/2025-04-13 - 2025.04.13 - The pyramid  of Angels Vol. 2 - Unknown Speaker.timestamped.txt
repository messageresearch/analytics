[1:39:16] Hallelujah.
[1:39:18] Uh now brother Branam in the message uh
[1:39:22] the world is falling apart. Paragraph
[1:39:24] 220 says what are we looking for
[1:39:29] friends? Hallelujah.
[1:39:32] Every one of us, we are here present.
[1:39:34] But what are we really looking for?
[1:39:38] Hallelujah. What are
[1:39:42] we? This is a very special
[1:39:44] question. Amen. Maybe some of us we are
[1:39:48] just here. We are saying ah we are just
[1:39:50] going to church. But what are we looking
[1:39:54] for? Amen.
[1:39:56] The real church is
[1:39:59] looking not for a
[1:40:02] denomination.
[1:40:04] Hallelujah. Not looking for a
[1:40:07] president.
[1:40:09] Amen. Not looking for a genius to come
[1:40:13] up.
[1:40:15] Hallelujah. But they are looking for a
[1:40:18] kingdom
[1:40:20] and a king to come. What is the kingdom?
[1:40:27] Listen to that. He says it's on earth
[1:40:31] right now.
[1:40:33] It's a
[1:40:35] spirit
[1:40:37] mystical body of Christ.
[1:40:41] Hallelujah. That's what we are looking
[1:40:44] for. When the pastors were coming here,
[1:40:48] they were not coming here to show us
[1:40:49] whether they can preach or whatever. But
[1:40:53] the main purpose is so that we can come
[1:40:56] to this
[1:40:57] point.
[1:40:59] Hallelujah. But at the same time, as
[1:41:01] much as we are celebrating that, as much
[1:41:04] as we are looking forward to that, h I
[1:41:07] don't want to spend much time. H I heard
[1:41:10] my friends singing that song. I hear the
[1:41:14] sound of
[1:41:15] freedom. H I will invite them once
[1:41:18] again. Amen.
[1:41:21] as we also get ready to celebrate
[1:41:25] together with our pastor. It's his 50th
[1:41:28] birthday today.
[1:41:33] Amen. Not yesterday, not tomorrow, not
[1:41:37] last week, but today.
[1:41:40] Today, on the 13th of
[1:41:43] April,
[1:41:46] 2025. Amen. He's celebrating his 50th
[1:41:50] birthday. So, let's sing that song,
[1:41:52] friends, if you could come. I hear the
[1:41:55] sound of freedom. I really enjoyed it.
[1:41:58] And I'm sure he will also really enjoy
[1:42:00] it. As we all stand up and sing together
[1:42:05] this song as we also welcome

[1:42:11] David. Amen.

[1:57:19] imperfection shown to me by the devil.

[2:01:39] Now you may be
[2:01:40] seated and please keep
[2:01:44] quiet because I am 50 years
[2:01:49] old. Omar I am 50 years
[2:01:52] [Laughter]
[2:01:57] old. I must tell them I am 50 years old.
[2:02:02] I am no longer that young man you knew.
[2:02:07] Now I am 50 years old and I'm here to
[2:02:11] thank the Lord for
[2:02:13] that. I am here together with
[2:02:17] you that I have been around my life for
[2:02:22] such a long
[2:02:24] time. People that have been with me.
[2:02:29] people that have
[2:02:31] uh understood uh my
[2:02:35] weaknesses and uh look at me through the
[2:02:39] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[2:02:42] people that have prayed for me, the
[2:02:45] people that have wished me all the
[2:02:48] good which has allowed me to be the
[2:02:52] person that I am
[2:02:55] today. 50 is a great number.
[2:02:59] The great the first
[2:03:02] uh man to
[2:03:04] speak on a 50-year
[2:03:07] jubilee was William Brham in
[2:03:11] 1956 when he counted the years of the
[2:03:15] revival. Say now that is 50
[2:03:18] years after that some decisions must be
[2:03:25] made. And I know the best place take
[2:03:28] decisions. It's in the presence of the
[2:03:31] Lord because he's the one that begs our
[2:03:36] life. It is with so much love that I
[2:03:39] stand before you this
[2:03:42] morning as I don't believe I'm really
[2:03:45] I'm growing old. I believe I'm growing
[2:03:50] wiser.
[2:03:53] I believe now I know
[2:03:57] better. I know better how to bear with
[2:04:00] people, how to understand
[2:04:03] people, how to carry the burden of
[2:04:07] others.
[2:04:09] I thank the Lord for your presence. I
[2:04:12] can't name
[2:04:13] everyone, but you know that each and
[2:04:17] everyone has a place in my heart.
[2:04:22] I will start by thanking the pastors
[2:04:25] that have come to be with us
[2:04:30] today together with their
[2:04:34] wives. I just want you to give them a
[2:04:36] round of
[2:04:37] applause for this
[2:04:43] moment. the honor they have given unto
[2:04:46] us to be
[2:04:50] here before
[2:04:55] everything. My greatest gratitude goes
[2:04:58] to the Lord Jesus
[2:05:00] Christ, my Lord and my
[2:05:04] Savior, the person for whom I
[2:05:08] have lived my old life.
[2:05:13] I have been
[2:05:16] privileged in my earthly life to live
[2:05:20] only for
[2:05:22] him. I thank
[2:05:24] God that he never allowed me to know a
[2:05:29] worldly
[2:05:31] life that he called me in my very young
[2:05:36] age. I never took a break from him.
[2:05:41] I never make a step outside then come
[2:05:47] back. I vow to live for
[2:05:50] him to honor
[2:05:53] him and to declare his goodness in the
[2:05:57] land of the living.
[2:06:01] I always tell young
[2:06:04] people that I am a testimony that a
[2:06:08] young man can be a Christian
[2:06:12] without any
[2:06:14] excuse. I thank God for that for his
[2:06:18] care and protection over my life. I can
[2:06:22] say now like the
[2:06:25] David which I am here to
[2:06:29] represent that I was young and now I am
[2:06:33] old. I have never seen a righteous
[2:06:36] forsaken.
[2:06:39] Yes indeed. I will
[2:06:42] also in this day
[2:06:45] remember my mother who gave birth unto
[2:06:50] me and my
[2:06:52] father with so much
[2:06:55] gratitude. I would love
[2:06:58] to also make this day to be a great
[2:07:02] tribute to what they have done in
[2:07:06] raising
[2:07:07] me and becoming the man that I am
[2:07:11] today. If I am a blessing to people,
[2:07:15] it's because God used some vessels to
[2:07:19] bring me on this
[2:07:21] earth. I salute them where they are.
[2:07:26] Though it's not easy for me to be far
[2:07:29] away from them, but I am so much
[2:07:32] thankful unto them. May God bless them
[2:07:36] richly. I had when I was walking in
[2:07:40] here, a brother told me that uh my mom
[2:07:44] sent sent a clip. I don't know if it's
[2:07:48] true, but or she just wanted me to feel
[2:07:52] good. Uh is it true where oh you are
[2:07:57] there is it true?
[2:07:59] Okay so I will just be very short
[2:08:04] um uh in saying some few words because
[2:08:09] today I wanted
[2:08:12] uh I have uh my father around pastor
[2:08:18] Kodima.
[2:08:21] So I told him, "Yeah, I was born 50
[2:08:25] years
[2:08:26] back." It was on Sunday on the 13th of
[2:08:31] April, 7 days after the birth of the
[2:08:35] prophet.
[2:08:40] [Applause]
[2:08:43] [Music]
[2:08:45] And
[2:08:46] uh I met pastor Kodima for the first
[2:08:50] time 7 years after my calling to the
[2:08:55] ministry. Uh he represent a lot unto me.
[2:08:59] Told him I want him to come and dedicate
[2:09:02] me today cuz I am born
[2:09:07] today. I I'm so thankful that Omar is
[2:09:11] there as well. God bless you mama. So
[2:09:15] much uh uh thankful unto the company
[2:09:20] that you have made around my life. Like
[2:09:23] uh Jesus was
[2:09:25] saying you know for you who have left
[2:09:27] your mothers your fathers I will give
[2:09:30] you mothers give you
[2:09:33] fathers. Amen. In this world, not in the
[2:09:37] coming world, in this
[2:09:40] world, I will give you in this world.
[2:09:42] Then in the coming world, eternal
[2:09:46] life. Uh but before I invite him, just
[2:09:50] wanted to give a short testimony cuz
[2:09:53] many
[2:09:54] time when somebody's dead, then there is
[2:09:59] someone who come and start
[2:10:01] reading about what the dead person was.
[2:10:05] He's already gone. All that you are
[2:10:08] reading is
[2:10:12] useless. Sometime is good to speak when
[2:10:16] the man is still alive. That's why the
[2:10:19] prophet say give to a man a rose when he
[2:10:22] still
[2:10:25] alive. It will benefit him more.
[2:10:29] So just a quick short story of
[2:10:33] myself as a
[2:10:36] testimony.
[2:10:38] Uh I was born on the 13th of April. Like
[2:10:42] I say it was on a
[2:10:44] Sunday that is 50 years back. And that's
[2:10:47] why I think I live all my life in church
[2:10:50] cuz I was born on Sunday.
[2:10:53] So if somebody sees me out of church, he
[2:10:56] must take me to a
[2:10:59] psychiatrist because my mental was made
[2:11:02] to be a church.
[2:11:07] So my father
[2:11:10] uh testified to my
[2:11:13] wife when we were still
[2:11:17] uh get when we were still young
[2:11:20] uh getting
[2:11:22] married. She told my wife Yeah. She told
[2:11:26] he told
[2:11:28] you he did not tell me you know how
[2:11:32] fathers
[2:11:34] are. So he told my wife that uh it was
[2:11:40] when this man was born that we decided
[2:11:44] to find the way to the
[2:11:47] Lord. Because when I was
[2:11:51] born, my mother got very
[2:11:54] sick and uh I was born in uh in in
[2:11:59] Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of
[2:12:02] Congo at that time,
[2:12:05] Zer. And the city was having an upmarket
[2:12:10] uh upper market suburb of
[2:12:14] European. And uh at that time my father
[2:12:17] was a
[2:12:19] very right h a highranked man.
[2:12:25] So I was
[2:12:26] born in the best
[2:12:29] environment
[2:12:31] where in a hospital where the president
[2:12:34] goes and where all the great people of
[2:12:38] the society they go. I think that's why
[2:12:41] pastor Kanik is here. He knows that
[2:12:46] place. So that we call the clinic GMA.
[2:12:51] Yeah. Um I was born there and uh my
[2:12:57] mother got sick and they tried to take
[2:12:59] her to all the best hospital and she was
[2:13:01] not
[2:13:02] recovering. So they decided, my father
[2:13:05] said they decided to go to a a lady, a
[2:13:07] mama there kind of healer by the invit
[2:13:12] by the advice of
[2:13:14] friends and that old lady gave them
[2:13:17] something that I was supposed to take so
[2:13:20] that my mother get same
[2:13:23] school. So I'm not a nobody.
[2:13:32] So uh because my father wanted me to be
[2:13:35] very close to the things that are
[2:13:39] religious and uh for the high school uh
[2:13:42] they took me to a Protestant school
[2:13:46] where
[2:13:47] uh we call it the Shaumba. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:13:51] Yeah. It was the best school of the
[2:13:54] country still until today.
[2:13:57] uh my principal was the minister of uh
[2:14:01] social affairs something like that and
[2:14:04] um I grew up in that environment uh with
[2:14:08] uh people of very high rank. My father
[2:14:12] really counted on me to be a great
[2:14:15] scientist and a great man in the
[2:14:19] society. But uh later on God came in and
[2:14:23] changed my direction.
[2:14:26] I think I had a picture here when I was
[2:14:28] 15 years old. Brothers, you always
[2:14:31] disturb my
[2:14:32] day. I told you if you mess with today,
[2:14:36] I remove your name from the book of
[2:14:39] [Laughter]
[2:14:43] life. Uh
[2:14:46] so then I think uh around 15 years old I
[2:14:52] I think at 14 years old I took the
[2:14:55] decision to be
[2:14:57] baptized and uh without the pressure of
[2:15:01] anybody without the request of anybody
[2:15:03] at the baptism queue uh people did not
[2:15:07] wanted to chase me out. So that's me at
[2:15:10] home. I'm 15 years
[2:15:14] old. Somebody told me, "Hey, you were
[2:15:17] you you used to love watch." I say,
[2:15:19] "Hey, I used to love good
[2:15:21] things." So that watch I was wake I was
[2:15:25] wearing. My father bought it for me. It
[2:15:28] was a very expensive watch at that time.
[2:15:30] Um I want to remember the brand
[2:15:34] um uh eh uh uh because uh he told me if
[2:15:39] you can pass
[2:15:41] 80% to go into uh uh uh uh the second
[2:15:45] section of high school because we had
[2:15:47] two sections of high school that I think
[2:15:50] I'm going I'm grade nine
[2:15:51] there. So then I had about 90%.
[2:15:57] Then uh so I was saying I I was really
[2:16:02] very intelligent. Now I don't know where
[2:16:04] it's gone.
[2:16:07] So I was really the best of my peers and
[2:16:12] uh I was I really made my family proud
[2:16:15] at that time because I was really very
[2:16:19] good and uh after that I think the that
[2:16:23] the there's another one for from
[2:16:26] university
[2:16:27] uh uh brother. Yeah.
[2:16:30] So this Oh where is me? Oh, the
[2:16:37] second.
[2:16:39] So, this is
[2:16:41] uh this is
[2:16:44] UPC. Yeah, UPC. Yeah. Then uh I
[2:16:49] went then I went um I had to be my
[2:16:54] father wanted me to be a medical doctor.
[2:16:58] So the day we went at the university at
[2:17:01] uh first year of uh so in our year I
[2:17:05] think you remember our first year at the
[2:17:08] university and uh first year of uh
[2:17:12] doctors they removed from the faculty
[2:17:14] and we went in the the big hole. Yeah.
[2:17:18] So when I enter in that big hole I was
[2:17:20] not comfortable because I was used to
[2:17:23] small classes. So then I I was not happy
[2:17:28] and they requested if I can take a
[2:17:30] transfer. I say no I want a small room.
[2:17:33] Then they say if you want a small room
[2:17:35] you have two options either you go for
[2:17:38] poly techniques or you go to science
[2:17:40] here uh a pure science. So I had to go
[2:17:45] to pure science
[2:17:47] uh because I did not want to be an
[2:17:49] engineer like my father. So then uh in
[2:17:54] science there I had a great experience
[2:17:58] with
[2:17:59] God. Uh that's when I received the
[2:18:02] baptism of the Holy
[2:18:03] Ghost. So when I finished there, I got
[2:18:08] my first employment as a product uh
[2:18:13] developer uh there. Yeah, this was my
[2:18:17] first job.
[2:18:18] I was 23 years old
[2:18:24] there. Oh, it's also
[2:18:26] there. So, this is
[2:18:31] 1998 as usual.
[2:18:35] So I started at a junior level and in
[2:18:38] few months I was taken at a management
[2:18:44] level and uh after that uh I made my
[2:18:48] branch to be the best of the whole
[2:18:51] continent and I was taken into
[2:18:55] uh kind of a political environment where
[2:18:59] I have worked in the government for some
[2:19:02] few days for few years sorry to and I
[2:19:06] was too young and the environment was
[2:19:08] not very good for me. So what happened?
[2:19:12] I think
[2:19:13] uh e I was saying that after my science
[2:19:18] uh when I got there and I realized that
[2:19:21] business was the way to go and I went to
[2:19:24] do some management statistic statistics
[2:19:27] uh uh uh uh
[2:19:29] college and uh I carried on with uh my
[2:19:33] education
[2:19:35] uh I think the numbers I can't count
[2:19:39] now maybe the Lord God has helped me in
[2:19:43] the journey at least uh to have in my
[2:19:48] background about
[2:19:51] uh almost three degrees now in which two
[2:19:56] masters
[2:19:57] accounted in engineering management and
[2:20:00] MBA and uh now finishing the data
[2:20:05] science and the Lord willing I'm
[2:20:08] preparing my PhD
[2:20:15] as I am already accepted.
[2:20:19] So that is briefly what I have been in
[2:20:22] my life but uh my life had a lot of
[2:20:26] things when I brothers you are late I
[2:20:29] won't go back there
[2:20:32] uh you can see I was wearing size 30
[2:20:36] now I never believe I will be big one
[2:20:41] day yeah you know this place I saw you
[2:20:45] there
[2:20:47] also so uh this was I think uh
[2:20:52] 997 97 Asia this
[2:20:56] very and that you remember you know the
[2:20:59] pastor of that church um where the
[2:21:04] revival no not ano
[2:21:07] uh kang
[2:21:09] yes before the ano came from this church
[2:21:13] yeah
[2:21:14] so we see we have been with the lord
[2:21:17] very very
[2:21:19] far. So, um I wanted to say I was trying
[2:21:23] to say
[2:21:24] something. I believe when I turned 25
[2:21:27] years old,
[2:21:29] uh I had an experienced with the Lord.
[2:21:32] Is that this is this is my first uh
[2:21:36] Yeah, this this is at my house, my first
[2:21:40] place. This is uh where I was living my
[2:21:45] first day. I'm not yet married. That's
[2:21:47] why I'm in the kitchen.
[2:21:50] So, but that when my wife saw me.
[2:21:55] So, I think she said herself, I must
[2:21:59] replace him in that
[2:22:03] kitchen. So, um I think that was maybe
[2:22:07] the same year I met her.
[2:22:12] Um am I am I
[2:22:15] somewhere? Uh yeah, you see we were
[2:22:18] still young serving the Lord and we have
[2:22:21] never quitted. We are still there until
[2:22:24] now. It's good to serve the Lord. You
[2:22:27] see, we are in the tent and so forth and
[2:22:30] we are there until
[2:22:33] today. Uh the Lord was so faithful and
[2:22:37] merciful unto us that uh we have seen
[2:22:42] great things. I think when I turned 25,
[2:22:45] as I was saying, that's when I got my
[2:22:49] uh a great experience with the Lord that
[2:22:52] led me to be here today. Yeah, I think
[2:22:56] that is my 25th
[2:22:58] birthday. I I was really a good
[2:23:01] man. I used to be handsome.
[2:23:09] Ah, and now I've lost so many
[2:23:15] lights. So, yeah, that was the day on my
[2:23:19] 25th birthday.
[2:23:22] Uh, yeah. You
[2:23:26] see,
[2:23:28] so you just come today, you don't know
[2:23:32] where we come from with my wife.
[2:23:37] So yeah that I think when uh we just
[2:23:40] started maybe we are not I think we were
[2:23:43] not yet married there. I think we got
[2:23:45] married a year after that. Uh that's
[2:23:49] when I'm still praying in English.
[2:23:52] [Laughter]
[2:24:00] Pastor Moses say there is a power to
[2:24:02] pray in English because the witches
[2:24:06] didn't go to
[2:24:11] school. They won't hear the English
[2:24:14] [Laughter]
[2:24:18] prayer.
[2:24:19] Okay. So this uh year of my life was uh
[2:24:23] very indicative of my future. That's
[2:24:27] when I got an experience to be connected
[2:24:30] to the ministry in the way I am now.
[2:24:33] That's when I got a different vision of
[2:24:36] the gospel. That's when I also got
[2:24:39] detached from my home and my family.
[2:24:43] uh not because I had a problem with um
[2:24:47] being away but because I realized that
[2:24:51] the vision that God gave unto me still
[2:24:54] needed to find a place where I will get
[2:24:59] people who can be able to understand it.
[2:25:02] uh because uh in the religious system I
[2:25:06] was really cast out because uh people
[2:25:10] thought that what I'm saying I'm
[2:25:12] creating them. You know I'm born in
[2:25:14] April. I'm very
[2:25:17] vocal. When I see something when he say
[2:25:20] no I say no. You cannot just turn me
[2:25:23] around. I can die for what I believe.
[2:25:27] Isn't it pastor
[2:25:29] Ron? So when I believe in something, no
[2:25:33] one can move me out of it. And that's
[2:25:36] how I lived. Support was taken away from
[2:25:39] me. I lost many things and but I kept on
[2:25:43] moving on. The Lord helped me a lot. I
[2:25:47] think uh and he has give me the
[2:25:50] opportunity to start meeting these
[2:25:52] friends of mine like the pastor Ron and
[2:25:56] so forth. First time we met in Cape
[2:25:58] Town. Uh then we went uh we met we were
[2:26:02] in Kinshasa the pastor Dioka's meeting
[2:26:05] in
[2:26:06] 2007. Then uh pastor Ron told me uh you
[2:26:11] I must take you to our
[2:26:13] elder. So we drove one night to see
[2:26:16] pastor. I think it was
[2:26:20] 2007 eight. Okay. And that was my first
[2:26:24] time to see uh to see pastor Kodima. And
[2:26:28] I felt such a connection. I felt like as
[2:26:33] I have been running away to find that
[2:26:36] connection when I met him the way he was
[2:26:39] just talking said but this is the man I
[2:26:43] was looking for. I needed somebody who
[2:26:46] can rise because you know like the
[2:26:50] pastor was saying here an eagle will
[2:26:53] catch a snake just fly high then the
[2:26:57] snake is paralyzed with the
[2:26:59] altitude. So you need somebody who can
[2:27:02] fly at that altitude
[2:27:05] then now you are able to now
[2:27:08] communicate and we really went along
[2:27:10] very well. The men of God here have has
[2:27:13] really been great support unto us. Uh
[2:27:17] the Lord fulfilled his vision for our
[2:27:20] lives to start the ministry here. I
[2:27:22] think uh there were the first person I
[2:27:25] was speaking to, pastor Rooney, Pastor
[2:27:27] Allan. Uh then uh we were starting to
[2:27:31] pitch tenties around here going door
[2:27:34] todo to call one person to believe in
[2:27:37] the Lord Jesus Christ. Then one was
[2:27:39] coming and we baptized until where we
[2:27:42] are today. I thank God for so many
[2:27:45] things
[2:27:47] uh that he has helped me in this life of
[2:27:51] mine that I have never caused a trouble
[2:27:54] to
[2:27:55] anybody. That one I can thank God for
[2:27:59] that. you know to be a minister at 50
[2:28:02] years
[2:28:03] old and you have never splitted a
[2:28:06] church. H you must really be proud of
[2:28:11] that. But in my record I have never
[2:28:15] splitted a church and I will never and I
[2:28:19] have never went into a church start
[2:28:21] digging for members because I don't
[2:28:24] believe in that. I always believe is if
[2:28:28] a man splits a church, God will never
[2:28:31] enter in that church. You have to repent
[2:28:35] first. And for me, repenting it mean go
[2:28:38] take those people back. And if you have
[2:28:41] a calling, go on the street and preach
[2:28:45] to one person, to two people, three
[2:28:47] people until you have an established
[2:28:50] ministry. Then we believe in your
[2:28:53] calling. But those callings of easiness
[2:28:56] of today where somebody just he was a
[2:28:59] deacon then he recruit members tomorrow
[2:29:02] he's a pastor. I unfortunately I don't
[2:29:05] believe in that. You know I'm born in
[2:29:08] April. You can't change
[2:29:11] me. Amen. Amen.
[2:29:16] H I think this picture is when I was
[2:29:19] still I was working in the housing
[2:29:21] department. I think this was uh as I was
[2:29:25] working as a technical advisor in social
[2:29:28] development of uh infrastructure the
[2:29:32] connection between infrastructure and
[2:29:35] social development.
[2:29:38] uh I think it was
[2:29:39] water uh world day of water something
[2:29:43] like that and uh that day I was just
[2:29:46] with the deputy
[2:29:48] president and uh but today I am a
[2:29:51] minister of the gospel it's bigger than
[2:29:54] being in the
[2:29:57] world thank you so much for being here
[2:30:02] uh brothers you're still carrying on
[2:30:04] with your
[2:30:05] photos you can
[2:30:08] Stop. It's fine. We have already seen
[2:30:11] these photos. Actually, it's myself. I
[2:30:13] was
[2:30:14] there. I just wanted to give a brief
[2:30:17] history because some people don't. They
[2:30:19] just see me behind the pulpit. There's a
[2:30:22] brother who was asking me, "Pastor,
[2:30:24] where did you come from? Did you drop
[2:30:26] from the sky or what?"
[2:30:29] Because we don't we only see you alone.
[2:30:32] We don't know if you grew up somewhere.
[2:30:35] We don't know if you have parents. Are
[2:30:37] you making me or what? Say no brother, I
[2:30:41] have a past. It's just that God has
[2:30:44] given me a new life. Amen. So, uh just
[2:30:49] before I call for pastor Kodima to come,
[2:30:53] I am closing with these words to say I
[2:30:59] am so thankful to the Lord. I am so
[2:31:02] thankful to you and I am so thankful to
[2:31:06] everyone who tried something one day to
[2:31:11] make my life easy somewhere. Life has
[2:31:14] not been so easy for me. I have suffered
[2:31:18] so much
[2:31:19] rejections, so much exclusion just
[2:31:23] because of my view. I thank God that I
[2:31:27] have
[2:31:28] never been out of him,
[2:31:31] never lived in the world, never defiled
[2:31:36] myself. I remained a Christian and I
[2:31:39] remained his servant to be a blessing
[2:31:42] for somebody. And I know that that day
[2:31:46] when you did that, you said that good
[2:31:49] words to help me move on. When you
[2:31:52] prayed for me that day, the Lord granted
[2:31:55] your prayer. That's why I am standing
[2:31:57] here
[2:31:59] today. You can give a round of applause
[2:32:01] for
[2:32:04] yourself. So maybe brothers uh since the
[2:32:09] mother uh my mom requested that the
[2:32:14] short clip if it's long you will cut it.
[2:32:17] You know these mas when they start
[2:32:19] talking sometime they don't finish just
[2:32:23] one minute for it. Are you
[2:32:27] ready? Ah brother I'm giving one minute.
[2:32:30] You still asking for one minute.
[2:32:37] Are you ready for it,
[2:32:39] brothers? One minute.
[2:32:45] Okay. God bless you, Pastor Moses. When
[2:32:49] I knew you, you were a young
[2:32:51] [Laughter]
[2:32:53] [Music]
[2:32:55] man. I don't think Abibu was born at
[2:32:59] that
[2:33:00] time. So, but now we are growing. We are
[2:33:05] getting somewhere. Amen. The Lord has
[2:33:08] been so good. I thank the church here,
[2:33:11] the final voice
[2:33:15] uh for standing with
[2:33:18] me. You know, I don't take no
[2:33:22] sense. I'm a very difficult person to
[2:33:26] live with. When I say no, it's a no.
[2:33:30] Oh, I hear my father's voice
[2:33:38] [Music]
[2:33:48] there. Yeah. So, I was still giving my
[2:33:53] uh technology is always the devil love
[2:33:56] technology to disturb the spirit.
[2:34:03] Look, now they are putting him upside
[2:34:06] down. Yeah, but he's upside down. It's
[2:34:09] not fair.
[2:34:11] Oh, you're looking for
[2:34:20] problems. Please brothers, pray for my
[2:34:23] brothers. There you see these young
[2:34:25] men. Some of them are not married.
[2:34:29] Maybe that's their
[2:34:34] problem. It's
[2:34:39] jubiline. They must be free. Pastor
[2:34:42] Moses was saying it's not time to preach
[2:34:45] repentance. It's time to preach
[2:34:47] [Laughter]
[2:34:49] Jubilee.
[2:34:52] Amen. Are you going to win, brothers?
[2:35:02] So I think we we have to call the
[2:35:10] pastor. So uh as they are preparing I
[2:35:14] just want to get my friends here. Each
[2:35:17] one of them can come and just say a word
[2:35:19] of blessing for me. Then when they are
[2:35:23] done, we get the pastor for the sermon.
[2:35:26] Uh let's pastor Moses, can you please
[2:35:29] come and say something? Just a word of
[2:35:32] blessing for me. That's why you are
[2:35:34] here. You know, you are four. They're
[2:35:37] like four living
[2:35:41] creatures. Amen. Are we all happy to be
[2:35:44] here? May God bless you richly for
[2:35:47] coming.
[2:35:49] I greet you in the wonderful name of
[2:35:51] Jesus Christ. H I thank God for pastor
[2:35:55] David. We came from far. The Bible says
[2:35:59] h that friends must show himself
[2:36:03] friendly. So I'm not going to say what I
[2:36:06] wanted to say because h corruption might
[2:36:09] set in. I see time has been prolonged
[2:36:13] but I cannot sit down without saying
[2:36:16] something. Amen. We came from far.
[2:36:18] Pastor David H has got many friends,
[2:36:22] many ministers friends that if they can
[2:36:25] come here h they can fill up the whole
[2:36:28] wall. So but h by God's grace we are
[2:36:32] four of us. Why? Because many are called
[2:36:36] but few are chosen. So h I thank God
[2:36:41] that you have chosen me from among many
[2:36:45] pastor friends.
[2:36:46] Amen. So and h you know I was just to
[2:36:51] see the character of pastor David you
[2:36:54] know that they are star they are bold.
[2:36:58] Pastor David is a bold man you know
[2:37:01] ambitious and they are also pioneers. So
[2:37:04] even if all of you you leave him he can
[2:37:08] start again because he's a pioneer from
[2:37:11] inside. So he's a fighter. Amen. And
[2:37:15] he's also a naturalb born leader,
[2:37:19] tenacious and is not scared. He's also
[2:37:23] not scared to take risks. You see, so
[2:37:26] that those are the is also caring and
[2:37:30] loving. I think the wife and the
[2:37:33] children can agree with me. Hallelujah.
[2:37:36] So I just before I go, I want to read a
[2:37:39] scripture. you know he was talking about
[2:37:42] uh he says the theme of these meetings
[2:37:44] it's h go free so I was just thinking
[2:37:50] when I was preaching on Friday about the
[2:37:53] emancipation
[2:37:54] uh proclamation so you know when I was
[2:37:57] studying that I realized pastor David
[2:38:00] that Abraham Lincoln in 1863
[2:38:05] he it was January 1 1863 Number three,
[2:38:10] he signed the Emancipation Proclamation
[2:38:15] to set free all those who were bound,
[2:38:18] who were bound and everything. And then
[2:38:21] as if it was a a coincidence, 100 years
[2:38:26] later in
[2:38:29] 1963, the mighty angel came down. It was
[2:38:33] another, can you imagine, pastor?
[2:38:37] 1863 the bill was signed for to
[2:38:40] emancipate the slaves and 100 years
[2:38:43] later uh the mighty angel comes in
[2:38:47] 1963 that's the real
[2:38:50] emancipation the real freedom is when
[2:38:53] the seals were opened and he came down
[2:38:58] with a what rainbow over his head and
[2:39:01] you know what a rainbow means it means a
[2:39:04] covenant
[2:39:06] So when God we saw the rainbow, it was a
[2:39:09] covenant that God was not going to
[2:39:12] destroy the world with water. So today
[2:39:16] 1963, we see another rainbow, another
[2:39:20] covenant. You know, God saw by himself
[2:39:24] because he could not saw by any greater
[2:39:26] but he saw by himself. So there is a
[2:39:30] covenant, an
[2:39:32] author. Amen. He saw by an oath that you
[2:39:38] and me we are going to be free. So an
[2:39:41] order it's a higher level of a vow. An
[2:39:45] author is different from an ordinary
[2:39:48] vow. An oath is more binding. So he saw
[2:39:52] by an oath that we are going to make it
[2:39:55] that we are going to be free that we are
[2:39:57] going to be emancipated. May God grant
[2:40:00] unto you as desires.
[2:40:03] Shalom. God bless you. Thank you so
[2:40:06] much,
[2:40:07] pastor. Indeed. Uh you are
[2:40:12] chosen. It was good to have pastor Moses
[2:40:15] here for this weekend. Amen. How many
[2:40:17] love our pastor, a friend, wonderful man
[2:40:21] of God. Yes, Pastor Rooney. Uh please
[2:40:26] come. God bless you, my friend. Good to
[2:40:29] have you in this weekend. I so much
[2:40:32] appreciate your presence. Thank you. I
[2:40:35] thought I was pushing pastor William to
[2:40:38] come and then you call my name.
[2:40:42] Greetings dear ones in the name of Jesus
[2:40:44] Christ. Also greet Mama Goda in the name
[2:40:48] of Jesus and the church and my old
[2:40:50] friends all of you. You are greeted in
[2:40:53] Jesus Christ's name. H there's not much
[2:40:56] to say. I'm also waiting you know for
[2:41:00] the word of God to be preached.
[2:41:03] and my cup or my umbrella has been
[2:41:06] turned upside down
[2:41:09] uh to get more water to drink. So,
[2:41:16] uh I was actually requested to send
[2:41:20] greetings and love from the
[2:44:25] has been built by God through the gift
[2:44:29] our pastor and his life also has been
[2:44:33] designed by God.
[2:44:36] You know whatever ambition he had or
[2:44:40] whatever plans he had in life, God
[2:44:43] altered that. And today we
[2:44:46] see the pastor David that we have never
[2:44:50] started with but was started with God. I
[2:44:54] got oh there are small things that made
[2:44:58] him to be this great and those are small
[2:45:01] things that should not be despised or
[2:45:03] forgotten. May God bless him and his
[2:45:06] family and his church. Shalom.
[2:45:12] [Applause]
[2:45:21] Dr.
[2:45:24] Interplanet. This This one is a
[2:45:27] worldwide
[2:45:29] missionary. There's no
[2:45:32] in churches in two different continents.

[2:45:50] [Music]
[2:45:53] I'm so happy to be with you this
[2:45:57] morning about Pastor
[2:46:01] David like a
[2:46:05] [Music]
[2:46:07] man. Is there
[2:46:12] anyone
[2:46:14] speak? If there's anyone who speak
[2:46:18] Is there anyone who speaks English?
[2:46:20] Okay, everybody
[2:46:22] speak
[2:46:28] English in heaven. There won't be only
[2:46:31] English speaking
[2:46:33] people. Everyone will be there in
[2:46:36] heaven. I would like to talk to you,
[2:46:39] Pastor David.
[2:46:42] God has granted
[2:46:43] me to meet
[2:46:47] people. I'm born a pastor
[2:46:50] [Music]
[2:46:51] son and pastor David too is a pastor
[2:46:55] son. We have different
[2:46:59] nature. Pastor David is someone who
[2:47:02] lo his own way to do things or see
[2:47:07] things. I've been born in a family of
[2:47:10] pastors.
[2:47:12] Pastor is my
[2:47:14] uncle. And so to build the
[2:47:19] tabernacle, we we bought
[2:47:23] everything. We both traveled all
[2:47:30] over. We were not interested in buying
[2:47:32] this and that.
[2:47:34] And one day I was coming from
[2:47:38] India from
[2:47:41] Australia. I could see that the trip was
[2:47:44] too
[2:47:45] long. So I said I will make a
[2:47:49] stop. So we came to pastor
[2:47:53] David and pastor
[2:47:58] David. We went to a
[2:48:01] [Music]
[2:48:02] mall where we trying to shop
[2:48:05] for
[2:48:13] shoes. So, Pastor David was watching
[2:48:17] screen, checking for
[2:48:20] mics, looking for
[2:48:22] [Music]
[2:48:24] things exactly like
[2:48:30] pastor tracks or prices.
[2:48:34] Uh, I really loved what he was
[2:48:37] [Music]
[2:48:40] doing because he was really deep in the
[2:48:43] things of the
[2:48:44] Lord. I really loved what he was
[2:48:48] doing. Now you pay attention to
[2:48:52] uh my my
[2:48:55] wish take pastor David to the pharmacy
[2:48:58] of
[2:48:59] God in the pharmacy of God.
[2:49:05] They are drunk.
[2:49:10] Drunk. Yes. Drunk people. Drunk people.
[2:49:14] Yes. They are drunk people. Drunk
[2:49:16] people. Uh Jesus was a drunk people.
[2:49:19] Drunk man. Yeah. Don't afraid. Drunk.
[2:49:22] Drunker. The drunker. The big
[2:49:26] drunker. Big drunker. Jesus was a
[2:49:29] drunker.
[2:49:32] I would like to take pastor David
[2:49:34] there. This world is led
[2:49:38] by two powers. The first power is God.
[2:49:42] The second power is
[2:49:43] Satan. Those both
[2:49:47] powers and Satan works with
[2:49:50] fear and God works with
[2:49:54] love. Fear will
[2:49:57] produce unbelief. Satan fear is the
[2:50:01] devil. Satan
[2:50:03] Satan will make you
[2:50:07] sick. If you are feared to not
[2:50:10] move, I will ask
[2:50:13] him because I would like to take him to
[2:50:16] the
[2:50:17] pharmacy so that he can take the
[2:50:20] medicine because when we operate our
[2:50:23] sick people,
[2:50:25] we put some medicine or two
[2:50:30] We use opium or
[2:50:33] like that's
[2:50:36] ania. When I do operation,
[2:50:40] [Music]
[2:50:41] I make sure to use the
[2:50:44] right the the best
[2:50:47] anesthesist and God anesthesist is the
[2:50:50] anesthesist.
[2:50:54] So to take
[2:50:56] F he had to put F.
[2:51:03] is that in
[2:51:05] the medicines and one of them
[2:51:09] is message uh let off the
[2:51:14] pressure in
[2:51:17] 56 paragraph
[2:51:21] 52 talking about
[2:51:24] anesthesis I would like to talk about
[2:51:27] opium the prophet says
[2:51:33] Have you already seen someone under the
[2:51:39] world the whole world belongs to
[2:51:41] you? He's talking
[2:51:46] about he's talking about it in the
[2:51:50] message.
[2:51:52] Why much
[2:51:59] You see
[2:52:00] 40 prophet
[2:52:03] says people think we are
[2:52:06] fool the
[2:52:09] [Music]
[2:52:11] devil it does have a
[2:52:19] [Music]
[2:52:22] substance
[2:52:24] so at 230
[2:52:29] God is true
[2:52:31] opiums and
[2:52:34] opium. It was
[2:52:37] delivered coming
[2:52:41] from after
[2:52:43] the
[2:52:45] flowers
[2:52:46] that when you tell
[2:52:49] it, it will quiet the
[2:52:53] fire. Even if they will tell you that
[2:52:55] you will die tomorrow, you won't
[2:52:59] be imagine a
[2:53:02] drunken. He does
[2:53:04] not he's in a
[2:53:09] state allow him even
[2:53:11] to it does not
[2:53:18] danger full of opium. Is that
[2:53:21] your
[2:53:35] man? How can you
[2:53:44] liberate the boss? Put a sentence to a
[2:53:48] sentence.
[2:53:51] so that he may
[2:53:56] not fear will take you

[2:54:22] Amen. Just a round of applause for the
[2:54:24] pastor. We thank him for leaving all his
[2:54:28] uh
[2:54:29] occupation. He was was very busy when I
[2:54:33] spoke to him. But he say one is with a
[2:54:38] very very huge
[2:54:41] church which I I just look from look at
[2:54:46] from
[2:54:49] far. So let's just hear what are we I'm
[2:54:54] going to interpret for my father.
[2:54:58] Amen. Okay. Yeah, brother. You can play
[2:55:02] the video so that if he says something
[2:55:05] wrong, I don't interpret.

[2:55:18] I wish you happy birthday.
[2:57:14] Hallelujah. Let your let you be prosper.
[2:57:18] Let your home prosper and everything you
[2:57:22] are doing prosper in the name of the
[2:57:25] Lord Jesus Christ.

[2:57:29] [Applause]
[2:57:33] Papa is
[2:58:28] Yeah, this are my parent, my father, and
[2:58:30] my mom. Uh my father, as I say, is a is
[2:58:35] a is a pastor. Uh for all the years, I
[2:58:39] grew up in a pastor's home. And he's not
[2:58:42] only a pastor, he's also a professor at
[2:58:44] the university. He teaches uh uh what um
[2:58:50] he's a road engineer as well. I think he
[2:58:52] has been uh uh in charge of uh the road
[2:58:56] and bridge department of the country for
[2:58:59] almost 30 years. So he has uh really uh
[2:59:04] raised us in the fear of the Lord in a
[2:59:07] way that sometimes people they think I'm
[2:59:09] a Christian but it's just the education
[2:59:11] I
[2:59:12] had. I was born to be a good man. I
[2:59:16] never smoked in my life. I never drank
[2:59:18] alcohol. I never defied myself with
[2:59:21] women. I have stayed a Christian until
[2:59:24] today. And I thank God for that. It's
[2:59:27] because of these parents that the Lord
[2:59:29] has given to me and now God has been so
[2:59:33] faithful in the ministry has given to me
[2:59:36] other parents that hold the fire of the
[2:59:40] gospel. So I thank God for pastor
[2:59:43] Kodima. Thank God for him being here and
[2:59:45] for all of you coming with him. I will
[2:59:49] give pastor Alan the honor to uh
[2:59:52] introduce Pastor Kima to the prophets.
[2:59:55] Amen.
[2:59:58] [Music]
[3:00:05] Now the service is for you to give to
[3:00:07] the pastor. It's up to
[3:00:16] you. Am I allowed to say even one
[3:00:21] thing? I know the pastor is tired. Then
[3:00:24] I say something
[3:00:26] for my friend Pastor David. One minute I
[3:00:30] will not go beyond that one. You
[3:00:34] know I'm a man of time. Amen. I would
[3:00:39] like just to say some few words to
[3:00:42] acknowledge
[3:00:43] uh this
[3:00:46] day that they call the
[3:00:49] golden. Amen.
[3:00:52] [Music]
[3:00:54] So years of life is not a small
[3:00:59] thing. May God bless you richly for the
[3:01:02] sacrifice for the commitment for
[3:01:05] everything you have done for the kingdom
[3:01:07] of God.
[3:01:09] Sometimes in tears and
[3:01:12] temptation in Christ all those things
[3:01:15] that you done have contributed to save a
[3:01:19] soul to heal somebody to restore
[3:01:22] somebody for this life you have like you
[3:01:25] said yourself part of most of it was
[3:01:28] consecrated to the Lord and today we are
[3:01:31] celebrating 50 years it is a milestone
[3:01:35] rejoice be happy let fear go away from
[3:01:38] You go as a David, as a bold man, no
[3:01:42] matter the golad that will stand before
[3:01:44] you, the Lord will give you strength to
[3:01:47] bring them all
[3:01:50] down. Like the prophet said, it is God
[3:01:53] that qualify the sometime we can feel
[3:01:56] that he's not the right man. But when
[3:01:58] God put you someplace, oh God, you are
[3:02:01] the right man. And I believe for these

[3:16:44] of.
[3:16:49] I also said to America,
[3:16:54] I have a pyramid.
[3:16:58] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So we are just
[3:17:03] going to read for so 15
[3:17:09] minutes then I will promise my pastor to
[3:17:13] come and finish up the Lord willing and
[3:17:19] then did you see the scripture we were
[3:17:23] looking at? Yes. Yes.
[3:17:27] We we will read Hebrews chapter 11.
[3:17:30] verse 10 and 11.
[3:17:35] Okay. For he looked for a city which
[3:17:38] have foundations, whose builder and
[3:17:40] maker is God. Through faith also Sarah
[3:17:44] herself received strength to conceive
[3:17:46] seed, and was delivered of a child when
[3:17:49] she was past age because she judged him
[3:17:52] faithful who hath promised. Hallelujah.
[3:17:55] Amen. Amen.

[3:18:02] You may be seated. God bless you.
[3:18:08] And happy birthday, pastor. Happy
[3:18:12] birthday. Amen. Amen.
[3:18:16] We will be together the
[3:18:19] Lord and we will never miss one another.
[3:18:26] Um, as I'm I said,
[3:18:31] we also have a pyramid.
[3:18:36] I don't
[3:18:38] know
[3:18:40] if you know about the pyramid.
[3:18:45] Brother Brenham,
[3:18:47] brother tells me time and again about
[3:18:52] the pyramid.
[3:18:55] build in the shape
[3:18:57] of the church.
[3:19:03] He he says the bread of
[3:19:05] Christ is made like a
[3:19:10] pyramid and I have noticed that many
[3:19:14] people do not know what it
[3:19:17] is but uh reading the books
[3:19:22] here of my
[3:19:24] prophet it tells me much about the
[3:19:29] pyramid and even he says is you will see
[3:19:33] your play your
[3:19:36] place in the
[3:19:39] pyramid. Amen. Amen. And I've realized
[3:19:42] that many
[3:19:44] people do not know
[3:19:46] their pyramid.
[3:19:50] Amen. Amen. So I've been going through
[3:19:54] that
[3:19:57] because brother Brennham even says about
[3:20:00] you
[3:20:02] that you'll find your
[3:20:05] place in the
[3:20:08] pyramid. Amen. Now, the pyramid
[3:20:11] was started back
[3:20:15] there. They tell us
[3:20:18] that Enoch Enoch, he didn't go around
[3:20:22] looking for the stones.
[3:20:26] The stones were already
[3:20:28] there. Amen. Amen. Amen. And now
[3:20:33] although today I'm not dwelling on
[3:20:36] that, I have just this part
[3:20:43] here because he tells me
[3:20:46] here the Lord he is no more.
[3:20:54] Amen. Amen.
[3:20:57] I'd rather read about two or three.
[3:21:02] He is no longer a mediator.
[3:21:06] His word says so.
[3:21:08] He is a king.
[3:21:12] Amen. Amen. Now let's read here a bit
[3:21:18] uh page
[3:21:20] 103. 103
[3:21:23] my friend. Here is the
[3:21:27] book 103. 103.
[3:21:33] He is no more a mediator.
[3:21:38] That's why I realized
[3:21:43] that the people that are called
[3:21:49] Christians, most of them, I'm not
[3:21:52] talking about the
[3:21:54] the church of
[3:21:58] Christ they are residing
[3:22:03] outside that's why brother Brennham says
[3:22:08] you will see your
[3:22:12] place in the pyramid
[3:22:15] pyramid but then we should ask I'll come
[3:22:20] with the pastor we will follow what
[3:22:27] We are even told that the
[3:22:29] stones that were used for
[3:22:33] building were found right
[3:22:38] there. Then
[3:22:40] Enoch the seventh
[3:22:44] man. That's why we are in the seventh
[3:22:46] age.
[3:22:50] Uh I don't have this book
[3:22:53] now. Uh blasphemous names.
[3:22:58] I don't know how
[3:23:01] I will still use it.
[3:23:05] Blasphemous names. Blasphemous names. It
[3:23:08] speaks of the ages.
[3:23:12] Now,
[3:23:15] Enoch, the seventh
[3:23:19] man, he was the one
[3:23:23] responsible for that
[3:23:26] stature. Amen. Amen.
[3:23:30] Oh, it seems like
[3:23:33] [Music]
[3:23:35] somebody I I'm watching my wristwatch.
[3:23:40] It is just laying a foundation here.
[3:23:47] This is the end of time.
[3:23:50] [Music]
[3:23:52] Amen. Amen. Amen. Now I must read find
[3:23:58] this part here.
[3:24:03] Brother, I think before I start,
[3:24:08] you know where where I am, where I am
[3:24:12] going. Each one of those
[3:24:16] ages had that rock
[3:24:21] confession because pyramid was built
[3:24:27] up in
[3:24:29] ages. Amen. And that's why brother
[3:24:32] Brenham says the church is like a
[3:24:36] pyramid. The bride is like a pyramid.
[3:24:40] Now it says each one of this, this is
[3:24:44] page 18. Page 18, paragraph 13.
[3:24:47] Paragraph 13. Each one of these
[3:24:51] ages had that rock
[3:24:55] confession. Amen. Rock confession.
[3:25:00] This age
[3:25:02] came with a rock
[3:25:05] confession. The next age came with a
[3:25:08] rock
[3:25:09] confession because it speaks of the
[3:25:11] white
[3:25:13] rock inside the pyramid pyramid.
[3:25:16] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[3:25:19] Now it
[3:25:20] says the white rock
[3:25:23] the
[3:25:24] foundation as brother Brennham says the
[3:25:28] foundation
[3:25:30] the in the book
[3:25:33] rapture rapture you find it in the
[3:25:37] foundation that is a
[3:25:40] rock
[3:25:42] white and then he
[3:25:44] says the cap
[3:25:49] Is that
[3:25:50] rock white rock?
[3:25:53] Amen. Amen. And now the church is built
[3:25:58] exactly like the bride. I will
[3:26:01] say because you
[3:26:04] have a church. You have the church and
[3:26:07] the
[3:26:10] bride. Now there's a part here. Let me
[3:26:15] read this a bit.
[3:26:19] That is page 103. Page 103.
[3:26:23] Paragraph 355. Paragraph 6 255. 255.
[3:26:29] Amen.
[3:26:30] He is no more a
[3:26:33] mediator. That is very important.
[3:26:38] Thank you Lord. He is no more a
[3:26:41] mediator.
[3:26:43] So as you see the people coming to
[3:26:46] church next time they are no
[3:26:49] more coming to church because there is
[3:26:54] no
[3:26:58] mediator brother says here he is no
[3:27:03] more a mediator. So that's why the
[3:27:07] people even today they don't know where
[3:27:10] they are going.
[3:27:12] They don't know whether they are coming
[3:27:15] or they come to church. Next time they
[3:27:18] are no
[3:27:19] longer they are somewhere else because
[3:27:22] the he is no longer a
[3:27:25] medium and then he says he is a
[3:27:31] king. Amen. Amen. Now the king a
[3:27:37] subject. Now you are the subject.
[3:27:43] Amen. Amen. Amen. Now I I read
[3:27:47] he is no more a mediator.
[3:27:50] Get it for me please if you can. Amen.
[3:27:55] That is 103 paragraph 25. Read it for me
[3:27:59] there. Same. But now he comes from here
[3:28:02] at this last last scene. He no more a
[3:28:06] mediator. He is king now. Amen. And what
[3:28:10] does he do if he's a king? He has to
[3:28:13] have subjects. And his subject is them
[3:28:16] that he has redeemed. And they cannot
[3:28:19] come before him until he takes his right
[3:28:22] rights of redemption.
[3:28:26] Shalom subject. Shalom is subject.
[3:28:29] Hallelujah.
[3:28:30] A subject is not a church
[3:28:34] goer. A
[3:28:37] subject. Did you do you know what is a
[3:28:40] sub subject?
[3:28:43] If you are a
[3:28:46] subject even tomorrow, even in eternity,
[3:28:52] you still be there. You are a
[3:28:55] subject. You are not a church
[3:28:58] god. Amen. Now today this is as we as
[3:29:04] I'm standing
[3:29:06] he is a king.
[3:29:11] Amen. I'm a follower of a king.
[3:29:16] All right. Amen.
[3:29:19] Now did you finish? Yes.
[3:29:23] Okay. Maybe let's pick up the second one
[3:29:26] before we continue.
[3:29:31] paragraph. You are responsible for this
[3:29:34] writing here. Page
[3:29:36] 122. This one.
[3:29:42] Okay,
[3:29:46] brother. What? What? What is What is
[3:29:49] this one?
[3:29:51] Yes. What is this? The 393. 393.
[3:29:56] Paragraph 393. The seven seals. The
[3:29:59] seven seal. Okay. Amen. Read it for us,
[3:30:01] my brother. It's saying page 574.
[3:30:06] It's saying we find that the the sixth
[3:30:09] seal has been open to us. We see it and
[3:30:13] we know that this seventh seal cannot be
[3:30:16] broke to the public until that hour
[3:30:18] arrive.
[3:30:22] So there is a public
[3:30:25] end as
[3:30:30] Amen. Now it is not open to the
[3:30:36] public. Churches are full of public.
[3:30:41] Amen. Amen. But now there's a bride of
[3:30:46] Christ. Amen. He is no
[3:30:49] more a
[3:30:51] mediator. Brother repeats
[3:30:54] this so that you should know
[3:30:57] Whether you are under kingship of the
[3:31:00] Lord Jesus
[3:31:02] Christ or you
[3:31:06] are public can come in
[3:31:14] out but now we are talking not
[3:31:20] about he is no more a
[3:31:24] mediator meaning you should know
[3:31:27] that if he is not a mediator
[3:31:32] to then
[3:31:35] what? Amen. Amen. They call him a
[3:31:40] lion and that is a
[3:31:43] king. Amen. Amen.
[3:31:47] Now he comes to be
[3:31:52] king. Uh, get it for me my brother.
[3:31:56] 107 paragraph uh
[3:32:00] 285. Paragraph
[3:32:03] 285. Right. Says, "Now he comes forth,
[3:32:08] step out from eternity back yonder off
[3:32:11] of the throne of the father where he
[3:32:14] said as an intercessor. Now he comes to
[3:32:18] be king to rule all nation with a rod of
[3:32:21] eye.
[3:32:23] That's it. Now, Abraham Abraham
[3:32:29] looking for a city.
[3:32:31] He knew that the city must have a
[3:32:36] king. He had to meet the king
[3:32:41] first. The reason you see people coming
[3:32:45] in the
[3:32:49] king. All right. Amen. Now
[3:32:55] they call him
[3:32:58] a lion,
[3:33:01] a king.
[3:33:04] From being a mediator,
[3:33:07] they call him king.
[3:33:12] What? And what else?
[3:33:15] Lion. Okay. Amen. Amen. A mediator.
[3:33:22] on his way
[3:33:25] to meet his
[3:33:28] subjects. Amen. Amen. When Abraham
[3:33:33] realized that I am a
[3:33:37] citizen of a
[3:33:39] city now must that
[3:33:42] city must have a
[3:33:45] king. And before I can settle in the
[3:33:48] sea, I must meet the
[3:33:52] king. As we are here all
[3:33:55] together, we are on our
[3:33:58] way to our home. Our home is a city. Our
[3:34:03] home is a
[3:34:05] city. Now, brother Brennan says, "Our
[3:34:08] home is also built like a city, not like
[3:34:13] like the pyramid.
[3:34:16] The bride
[3:34:18] also is built like a
[3:34:22] pyramid. That's my prophet.
[3:34:25] Amen. Amen. Now, let me read something
[3:34:29] quickly
[3:34:32] here. This is not my book. Oh, God bless
[3:34:35] you. Amen. Yeah, God bless you,
[3:34:40] sir. Uh, let's look at this.
[3:34:46] The sixth seal has been
[3:34:51] opened. We see it and we know that the
[3:34:56] seventh seal cannot be
[3:34:59] broken to the public.
[3:35:05] You know you
[3:35:06] have the
[3:35:09] public as we have the ch the church we
[3:35:13] have the bride.
[3:35:15] Amen. Amen. All right. Amen. Then it
[3:35:21] says and uh we know that this seventh
[3:35:25] seal can not be
[3:35:28] brought to the public.
[3:35:32] Exactly. Why the
[3:35:35] public? It is
[3:35:37] because we you will realize that some
[3:35:41] are in the
[3:35:43] pyramid. Amen. But we'll come down so
[3:35:46] that you can hear. Brother Bren, I'm
[3:35:48] saying
[3:35:51] this. We know
[3:35:53] that this seventh
[3:35:56] seal cannot be
[3:35:58] broke to the
[3:36:01] public. Exactly. M Amen. It's for the
[3:36:06] bride,
[3:36:08] for the
[3:36:09] citizens until that hour.
[3:36:13] Right. Amen. Now we used to to be called
[3:36:19] public but it
[3:36:22] separated when now hear that this seven
[3:36:28] seal that was not revealed to the
[3:36:31] public.
[3:36:34] was revealed to the
[3:36:36] bride. But I read something
[3:36:39] here.
[3:36:41] Uh the prophet
[3:36:45] says I will skip to one thing until next
[3:36:49] time we come
[3:36:52] to one part. Amen.
[3:36:56] and the seven seals.
[3:36:59] You
[3:37:00] have
[3:37:04] seven seals.
[3:37:08] But then here is something here.
[3:37:15] Seven seals.
[3:37:18] Seven seals. Seven flying angels.
[3:37:22] Angels.
[3:37:27] interpret and the
[3:37:32] seven you start with seven
[3:37:36] churches until you end
[3:37:38] up you look into the
[3:37:43] pyramid of the seventh man.
[3:37:50] That's why the church ages also
[3:37:54] comes with the seven messenger. Seven
[3:38:00] messenger. Brother Brenham says the
[3:38:04] church is shaped like a
[3:38:09] pyramid. So the whole thing is
[3:38:12] pyramid. The shape of
[3:38:15] pyramid. Then he tells you of a white
[3:38:19] stone in the
[3:38:22] pyramid. For again he told me
[3:38:27] that you I will know my place in the
[3:38:34] pyramid. Hallelujah. Amen. Okay. Amen.
[3:38:37] Now you have the pyramid of stone.
[3:38:42] You have the pyramid of angels.
[3:38:46] Amen. And you know about the the the
[3:38:48] birds that came
[3:38:50] flying seven
[3:38:54] fromity,
[3:38:57] you know, they came from the west.
[3:39:01] Amen.
[3:39:03] And getis
[3:39:09] chapter 3, chapter 6. Genesis.
[3:39:14] Yes.
[3:39:17] Genesis 2.
[3:39:20] Yes, sir. Genesis chapter 2 verse
[3:39:23] 8. And the Lord God planted a garden
[3:39:26] eastward in Eden. And there he put the
[3:39:30] man whom he had formed.
[3:39:34] In Egypt. In Eden. Where do you get east
[3:39:39] and west? And the Lord God planted a
[3:39:42] garden eastward in Eden. Then brother
[3:39:46] here
[3:39:48] says, "And then I went
[3:39:53] west
[3:39:55] to
[3:39:56] connect with the
[3:39:58] angel and came
[3:40:01] back to reveal it to the bride.
[3:40:08] The garden was
[3:40:11] eastward. That's why he tells you that
[3:40:15] east and
[3:40:16] west
[3:40:19] met east is
[3:40:22] angels as he said they
[3:40:25] came and picked him up.
[3:40:30] All right. Amen. My
[3:40:33] friend is Is that yours?
[3:40:38] Oh, God bless you, sir.
[3:40:42] East and west.
[3:40:45] He says, "I went
[3:40:48] west." Amen. To connect connect
[3:40:54] with that means from
[3:40:57] east he went
[3:41:00] west. Hallelujah. To meet with the
[3:41:04] angels. Amen. and came back
[3:41:09] east to preach to
[3:41:12] us from east.
[3:41:16] All right. Amen. Amen. We'll still find
[3:41:19] it. We'll still find it. Amen.
[3:41:24] And even when he met the
[3:41:27] angels, he met a notable one.
[3:41:33] [Applause]
[3:41:34] Then he comes and say the angel with the
[3:41:37] seventh.
[3:41:42] All right. Amen. This is not just a
[3:41:46] human
[3:41:49] gospel. There's angels
[3:41:52] here. Okay. In the
[3:41:56] pyramid. The whole thing ends up in the
[3:41:59] pyramid. Brother says,
[3:42:02] You will see or find your your
[3:42:07] place in the
[3:42:10] pyramidal things ends up
[3:42:14] there. But we'll come with the pyramid.
[3:42:18] What is the pyramid?
[3:42:21] Now before I I I close here,
[3:42:27] uh pyramid
[3:42:30] speaks straight to the end.
[3:42:37] Oh yeah, I forget about my book here.
[3:42:42] uh each one of those
[3:42:46] ages had that rock
[3:42:50] confession means every
[3:42:53] age can
[3:42:55] confess that white
[3:42:58] rock the the saints at each
[3:43:04] age the saints
[3:43:08] sleep waiting and waiting
[3:43:15] eating on on till till all
[3:43:21] ages. Now this
[3:43:24] stone brother Brandham will tell
[3:43:26] you Peter
[3:43:32] means little
[3:43:35] stone. Then he said to Peter, "Thou art
[3:43:40] a small stone or a little stone, and
[3:43:44] upon this little
[3:43:46] stone, I will build my
[3:43:50] church and the gates of Hes shall
[3:43:56] never." Amen. Amen. Amen.
[3:44:00] We we are not worshiping
[3:44:05] in a sandy church.
[3:44:09] No, but the rock of
[3:44:14] ages. I was in
[3:44:17] Malawi. We were walking alongside the
[3:44:21] lake. I was with two
[3:44:24] brothers. Now there were some
[3:44:26] boulders
[3:44:28] outside. I said to the brothers,
[3:44:31] "Brothers, do you see these boulders?"
[3:44:34] They said, "Yes."
[3:44:36] I
[3:44:36] said did you know that there was one
[3:44:40] time when the Lord Jesus
[3:44:42] was these boulders were
[3:44:46] also that's why we sing rock
[3:44:50] of left for
[3:44:54] me
[3:44:56] eternally. Amen. Amen.
[3:44:59] Now I
[3:45:03] read this each one of these
[3:45:08] ages had that
[3:45:10] rock started there in the
[3:45:13] pyramid. You know about the white rock
[3:45:16] in the
[3:45:17] pyramid. Amen. Amen. So each of these
[3:45:23] ages had that rock
[3:45:26] confession meaning they come and confess
[3:45:30] that they confess that
[3:45:33] rock the next age they come they confess
[3:45:38] the rock.
[3:45:40] So if there's no raw
[3:45:42] confession in that age that is not
[3:45:47] his because there's no
[3:45:50] confession they come and
[3:45:52] confess
[3:45:54] him. Amen. Another age they come and
[3:45:59] confess him.
[3:46:02] Oh my the saints
[3:46:06] are sleeping waiting and
[3:46:11] waiting are

[3:46:26] every the
[3:46:28] saints predestinated by God They come to
[3:46:32] confess
[3:46:36] that is
[3:46:38] Jesus. The next age they come Jesus. The
[3:46:42] next age they come Jesus confess the
[3:46:47] rock. Not only by saying Jesus but by
[3:46:52] receiving the
[3:46:55] revelation. Hallelujah. you without
[3:46:58] revelation you can't worship
[3:47:04] him you can pray
[3:47:06] churches but you can't worship the true
[3:47:10] ones they come to the rock and confess
[3:47:13] the
[3:47:15] rock when they live they live here comes
[3:47:19] the
[3:47:20] following to to
[3:47:23] confess the rock and leave. Here comes
[3:47:27] the third. First the rock, they leave
[3:47:32] until to the
[3:47:35] end. Amen. Let's go there. Amen. God
[3:47:39] bless you, sir.
[3:47:42] Amen. Amen. You can worship for thousand
[3:47:47] years. If you don't reach
[3:47:50] that rock, you haven't started.

[3:48:03] This age it pulls this
[3:48:06] age. They are from one big
[3:48:12] rock coming
[3:48:15] together. Amen. Now that's why I said to
[3:48:19] this young man in
[3:48:21] Malawi, this rock
[3:48:24] was all was here.
[3:48:29] Every
[3:48:31] age we come to worship the rock. That is
[3:48:35] what the L the Lord has typed to
[3:48:39] do. In closing, it says
[3:48:44] uh each one of these
[3:48:47] ages had that
[3:48:50] rock confession.
[3:48:53] It doesn't say it has a
[3:48:55] rock. No. If there's no
[3:48:58] confession, then it's just a
[3:49:01] rock. But this
[3:49:03] one,
[3:49:04] Amen. rock
[3:49:08] confession, the saints are sleeping,
[3:49:12] waiting, waiting.

[3:49:49] Christ. Our God is a great God. He's a
[3:49:53] mighty God. Amen. All coming from

[3:50:01] know. Should we go, brother? If we can
[3:50:04] go, coming back, you'll still find
[3:50:09] this. A real

[3:54:44] Amen.
[3:54:48] You know Peter means little rock.
[3:54:53] That's why the Lord
[3:54:54] Jesus he
[3:54:56] said thou art
[3:54:59] Peter meaning thou art a
[3:55:04] little and upon this
[3:55:07] little I will build my
[3:55:11] church. Now it's from that
[3:55:13] rock to the rock to the
[3:55:17] rock. Amen. Okay. Amen. So now it says
[3:55:26] h this Peter the stone.
[3:55:32] Do you remember how he
[3:55:34] confessed the Lord Jesus Christ?
[3:55:39] Even when he was
[3:55:42] persecuted, he said, "I shall not die
[3:55:45] like my."
[3:55:50] All right. Amen. That was a a real
[3:55:54] rock. You know, if you are a child of
[3:55:56] God, you are a rock, a small rock.
[3:56:02] Okay. Amen. Now it says here,
[3:56:07] brother, did I finish that that book?
[3:56:10] Okay, what I don't do
[3:56:14] uh I want to read perhaps the last
[3:56:20] thing it it it
[3:56:23] says now it skips to a pyramid.
[3:56:29] The
[3:56:30] pyramid we are told that
[3:56:33] The stones used to build a
[3:56:37] pyramid they they were found
[3:56:40] there. God had prepared the stones
[3:56:45] already. There was no chop chop
[3:56:49] chop. Amen. Amen. And now Enoch the
[3:56:53] seventh man found the stones
[3:56:56] there. the stones of rock of
[3:57:00] ages of ages to build that pyramid.
[3:57:07] And we're still coming with the
[3:57:12] pyramid. I want to read this. Maybe it
[3:57:16] will be the last
[3:57:18] one on the
[3:57:20] inside of that pyramid.
[3:57:24] Because the prophet of God says,
[3:57:28] Even your place, you shall find your
[3:57:31] place in the
[3:57:36] pyramid, not in the church. You can go
[3:57:39] to church and so that's something
[3:57:43] else. But if you are
[3:57:45] predestinated, you'll be found in the
[3:57:49] pyramid. You see the
[3:57:52] difference there. There's no falling
[3:57:54] away there. H once in there.
[3:57:59] Amen. Amen. You are like Abraham.
[3:58:03] You know
[3:58:04] Abraham since he was
[3:58:08] born until he started he recognized that
[3:58:12] there's a
[3:58:14] king and his ministry is to go to that
[3:58:20] king. He's go to the city. He knew that
[3:58:24] there was a city
[3:58:26] somewhere and he started
[3:58:29] to lead the
[3:58:32] saints to the city.
[3:58:36] Amen. Okay. Amen. We will come to that.
[3:58:39] But here it says
[3:58:43] uh
[3:58:45] I
[3:58:49] brother
[3:58:51] okay let me come to this now amen we'll
[3:58:55] come back to that
[3:58:58] now apart from the pyramid
[3:59:02] we have here brotherham
[3:59:06] introduced to me and you
[3:59:09] The flying,
[3:59:11] the flying
[3:59:16] interpretation that that is the book of
[3:59:19] seals.
[3:59:21] Amen. Because it says,
[3:59:25] I want you to
[3:59:29] notice what taken
[3:59:32] place. And if you listen to the tape,
[3:59:39] of what time
[3:59:43] is. You will notice that the
[3:59:47] angel Oh, now it's taking us to the
[3:59:52] angels, but it's also in the we see
[3:59:57] this
[3:59:59] angel also in the pyramid form.
[4:00:06] So, All things that are
[4:00:11] predestinated are found to be in the
[4:00:17] pyramid. I'm not talking about the the
[4:00:20] pyramid of
[4:00:21] stone. There is the pyramid flying
[4:00:25] angels
[4:00:28] angels. It all comes the church is also
[4:00:31] in the pyramid
[4:00:33] form. The angels came in the pyramid
[4:00:35] form.
[4:00:37] All is in the form of
[4:00:41] pyramid. But let's read this last one.
[4:00:45] And the
[4:00:47] angel also in the form of a pyramid. He
[4:00:50] started there as the pyramid of
[4:00:54] stones and they came at a steep the
[4:00:57] pyramid of
[4:00:59] angels until we come to the end. Now we
[4:01:03] see the angel was very notable.
[4:01:07] The rest of
[4:01:09] them just
[4:01:12] was
[4:01:14] seemed
[4:01:16] ordinary. This
[4:01:18] angel was a
[4:01:21] noted you know they have you have
[4:01:25] angels but there's a noted
[4:01:29] angel. You know of
[4:01:31] Christians or believers but then and the
[4:01:36] noted
[4:01:40] believers there's noted
[4:01:44] believers. You don't you don't have to
[4:01:46] ask somebody because they are
[4:01:51] noted a noted child of
[4:01:55] God. You don't have to study about
[4:01:58] you. It says is noted.
[4:02:04] Amen. All right. Amen. Amen. I finished
[4:02:07] this paragraph.
[4:02:13] We we are still talking about the
[4:02:14] pyramid.
[4:02:16] You will understand the next time you
[4:02:18] see the whole thing
[4:02:20] about the the pyramid pyramid. All
[4:02:24] right? Because it ends up like that.
[4:02:28] And brother says, "You will find your
[4:02:32] place."
[4:02:35] In the pyramid. Amen. Have you found
[4:02:40] your
[4:02:41] place? Hallelujah. In the pyramid.
[4:02:45] Pyramid. The children of God also the
[4:02:50] the bread is built in the shape of the
[4:02:54] pyramid. pyramid. Amen. The city is in
[4:02:59] the shape of
[4:03:01] the pyramid.
[4:03:03] So the whole thing
[4:03:06] fitly. You go to the place that was made
[4:03:11] for
[4:03:12] you
[4:03:14] special. You are here. You have a place
[4:03:17] already.
[4:03:20] The pool is coming from that
[4:03:24] place. Your
[4:03:27] position is pulling.
[4:03:31] All right. Amen. You are not go around
[4:03:34] looking for a
[4:03:37] place. It is already
[4:03:42] there. The angel was very notable.
[4:03:48] My mind
[4:03:51] is notable.
[4:03:54] Hallelujah. Amen. You can't go to to
[4:03:57] meet something you don't know.
[4:04:00] You going to a notable
[4:04:04] position a position place. Amen. You
[4:04:07] know where you are
[4:04:10] going. Hallelujah. That's
[4:04:13] why they won't tell me that tomorrow
[4:04:16] saying she has left the church.
[4:04:21] Then I will say yes she was in the
[4:04:24] church or he was in the
[4:04:27] church. There is no notable place
[4:04:32] for brother. Let me finish this p. Amen.
[4:04:38] You know it is impossible.
[4:04:42] for a child of God to fall off.
[4:04:47] It is
[4:04:49] because there's a notable
[4:04:53] one you are standing here. There's one
[4:04:56] in the
[4:04:59] pyramid the
[4:05:03] notable. Okay. Amen. The angel was very
[4:05:08] notable. The rest of them
[4:05:11] were
[4:05:15] ordinary. Amen. Amen. And uh in the
[4:05:21] constellation in the form of a
[4:05:26] pyramid I just read up to here in the
[4:05:30] form of a pyramid.
[4:05:32] The rock was not
[4:05:38] written. Hey brother,
[4:05:41] welcome. Amen. And the angels
[4:05:48] uh sorry some took me into that
[4:05:52] pyramid by themselves.
[4:05:56] That is brother Brenham.
[4:06:00] Now meaning that if he is taken in the
[4:06:04] pyramid that that would mean that the
[4:06:08] church is in the
[4:06:11] pyramid no longer a
[4:06:15] church the notable ones.
[4:06:20] You know if I come every
[4:06:22] time coming to the
[4:06:25] tabernacle I come to meet the new
[4:06:27] tables.
[4:06:33] Amen. Amen. You don't have to ask him.
[4:06:36] Are you still working
[4:06:38] right? He's a notable
[4:06:41] one. Amen. Some you have to
[4:06:45] ask. Are you still right? Are you all
[4:06:48] right?
[4:06:55] This pyramid
[4:06:57] came through the
[4:07:00] chambers chambers. I called brother
[4:07:05] here and and then he says
[4:07:09] but the headstone was still not
[4:07:14] there but the the place was there for
[4:07:17] the
[4:07:20] headstone he's coming
[4:07:23] the lastly here the angel was to my
[4:07:29] left would really be that
[4:07:33] last seventh
[4:07:36] angel. The seventh angel
[4:07:40] messenger
[4:07:42] noted the
[4:07:44] seventh
[4:07:46] angel. You know if you are in the
[4:07:50] message that's one part of you is
[4:07:53] supernatural.
[4:07:54] [Applause]
[4:07:58] That's why brother
[4:07:59] Brenham speaks about the seven
[4:08:02] se that was
[4:08:06] there before the
[4:08:09] foundation. We don't have a new seventh
[4:08:14] seal. No, it is the seventh
[4:08:18] seal. And he says the seventh seal was
[4:08:23] opened
[4:08:24] there before the foundation
[4:08:27] of Amen. Because you go
[4:08:31] back you
[4:08:33] find who who who who were we
[4:08:39] then? Yeah.
[4:08:42] Brothers we were there. The seals the
[4:08:46] prophet says were he were
[4:08:50] opened. He says the seventh seal that
[4:08:53] was
[4:08:54] opened before the foundation of the
[4:08:57] world. Now if you are not there then you
[4:09:01] are
[4:09:05] notable then you'll argue and say the
[4:09:09] seventh is not
[4:09:10] open because you were not
[4:09:13] there. But the
[4:09:16] notables, Amen. Amen. They were
[4:09:19] there. You know, brother Brenham
[4:09:22] says h everything that was
[4:09:29] created say it is temporal. Is
[4:09:33] temporal. That's why my
[4:09:36] body is
[4:09:38] temporal. But there's another man
[4:09:40] inside.
[4:09:41] [Applause]
[4:09:44] The notable one.
[4:09:47] He will he was born not to die.
[4:09:53] This one was
[4:09:54] born. But the
[4:09:57] insider is is
[4:09:59] notable
[4:10:02] and you go to the garden of Eden, he was
[4:10:06] [Applause]
[4:10:07] there. That's why you are not there. You
[4:10:11] will make arguments some when somebody
[4:10:13] speaks to you
[4:10:15] about but if you are
[4:10:18] there just only a
[4:10:26] will says
[4:10:29] uh the seventh
[4:10:32] angel if we were if you would
[4:10:36] count left to
[4:10:40] right him coming towards the
[4:10:44] east because we have to come to to to to
[4:10:49] this east and
[4:10:52] west. He says in east and
[4:10:56] west
[4:10:59] met it is along the way here
[4:11:03] that that is seventh
[4:11:08] and
[4:11:09] uh sorry somewhere they were
[4:11:13] crossed. Oh oh oh what is it? He was on
[4:11:17] my
[4:11:17] left. Who was there? Who was there? The
[4:11:21] seventh entry.
[4:11:23] the notable
[4:11:27] looking to
[4:11:28] him towards the
[4:11:31] west
[4:11:35] because actually
[4:11:38] angels their
[4:11:40] please where was their
[4:11:44] place that was their place that's
[4:11:48] why brother Brennham says I had to
[4:11:55] to connect with the angels
[4:11:58] message and come
[4:12:01] back and preach to you to the church
[4:12:05] this message.
[4:12:06] So to preach
[4:12:08] there uh to start the church to start
[4:12:12] the service there he had to go west
[4:12:17] and came back with the angels
[4:12:22] message and the ministry started there.
[4:12:26] That's why even
[4:12:28] today if when the seals were
[4:12:32] open he went
[4:12:35] west always is to bring east and west
[4:12:40] together. Amen. Amen. Amen brother that
[4:12:44] is not a
[4:12:46] church that is
[4:12:49] the the
[4:12:51] notable ones. Amen coming towards the
[4:12:55] east.

[4:13:11] yourself did you know your your notable
[4:13:14] one.
[4:13:18] Amen. You'll see when you come to
[4:13:22] that uh east and west.

[4:14:15] is this seventh

[4:26:38] God bless you dear pastor for coming

[4:26:47] know. Yes. The body maybe you had to
[4:26:53] force yourself to be here. Amen.
[4:26:56] But it because I was reading in the
[4:26:59] Bible
[4:27:01] that it is uh
[4:27:03] Abraham who blessed Isaac.
[4:27:07] The Bible say when Abraham was stricken
[4:27:10] by age
[4:27:12] then he called his
[4:27:13] children to bless
[4:27:15] them. And Isaac blessed Jacob.
[4:27:20] He was stricken by age, but his hands
[4:27:24] has an anointing.
[4:27:27] He called his children. Amen. And he
[4:27:31] requested a meal as an offering.
[4:27:35] Yes. Knowing that God honors offerings
[4:27:39] for prayer.
[4:27:40] Amen. In my hands, I also have this
[4:27:44] offering. Amen. And I know it is not
[4:27:48] because you need what is in this
[4:27:50] offering. Yes, sir. But it's because God
[4:27:54] needs an offering to give a blessing.
[4:27:57] Amen. Amen.
[4:27:59] And the Bible say even Jacob stricken by
[4:28:03] age. Yes sir. He called his children
[4:28:06] to bless them. Amen. The same
[4:28:10] as Abraham blessed Isaac. Isaac blessed
[4:28:14] Jacob and Jacob blessed the
[4:28:18] patriarch like he invited
[4:28:21] Manasseh and Ephraim. He say you are the
[4:28:25] children who were born in another land.
[4:28:29] But uh because I was not there I take
[4:28:33] you for myself as my children as you. We
[4:28:38] believe also that the Lord has connected
[4:28:41] us. Yes sir. through the same angelic
[4:28:44] connection that will make one family for
[4:28:48] his kingdom. Amen. And I believe your
[4:28:52] prayers together with the servants of
[4:28:55] God that are here, Amen. will help me to
[4:28:59] have more victory to fight battle with
[4:29:02] strength and to have more courageous
[4:29:06] so that the same fight you went through
[4:29:09] and overcame the same strength may come
[4:29:13] upon me to overcome also in that
[4:29:16] battlefield.
[4:29:25] Amen. Great is thy

[4:31:51] my brother.

[4:59:05] uh remaining for the
[4:59:08] lifetime after that it's the
[4:59:11] battle as a a doctor
[4:59:18] physician I would like to help you
[4:59:20] saying this you you don't have to forget
[4:59:24] this it will help you the rest of your
[4:59:29] life sometimes you'll see people with
[4:59:32] wrinkles
[4:59:34] It's because they lack
[4:59:36] joy. The prophet said talking about it.
[4:59:40] It's a
[4:59:42] treat. When you come to church, you must
[4:59:44] be happy,
[4:59:46] joyful because after here going
[4:59:49] home, you be getting bad news from the
[4:59:55] family, getting bad
[4:59:57] news. And God has prepared a time when
[5:00:01] we come gather here to listen to the
[5:00:04] word. God changes our
[5:00:08] thoughts. He renew us. The renewal is
[5:00:11] here in the church.
[5:00:14] That's the pastor called
[5:00:17] him after
[5:00:20] seeing I heard that he
[5:00:22] was seeing him
[5:00:26] preaching at this age at this
[5:00:29] age. I can say that it was God who was
[5:00:36] here always going to thank the God for
[5:00:39] him.
[5:00:41] The secret of life it's around three
[5:00:45] things. That's what I'm going to tell
[5:00:47] you.
[5:00:49] Now in the pharmacy being a doctor I
[5:00:52] will tell
[5:01:03] you. Okay. I will I will communicate.
[5:01:11] You want to try?
[5:01:17] Okay. Pharmacy behind outside there.
[5:01:23] It's like a business
[5:01:26] here. I am a
[5:01:29] doctor. These are
[5:01:32] businesses. Do you know where there is a
[5:01:35] serpent on that
[5:01:37] cross? Which means when you take the
[5:01:39] medicine, you accept the
[5:01:42] death. There's a way that you can skip
[5:01:46] keep skip keep it.
[5:01:49] You must keep
[5:01:50] yourself today if you don't have
[5:01:53] money. You must know that you will
[5:01:56] die and you must be really conscious
[5:01:58] about
[5:02:00] it. The only thing that must keep you
[5:02:03] alive today is the word of
[5:02:06] God.
[5:02:10] information can help
[5:02:12] you. I said it because I have a great
[5:02:15] heart.
[5:02:18] Every morning when you wake up,
[5:02:22] [Music]
[5:02:24] never miss in your house.

[5:02:43] part. Never be in.
[5:02:48] You will never die of a stroke,
[5:02:52] never
[5:02:59] never flexible, tender. Yeah. Because
[5:03:02] that's what makes your veins to be
[5:03:06] flexible. Because you are always angry,
[5:03:11] nervous. You always have a frown
[5:03:15] face and that is making your nerves to
[5:03:20] be
[5:03:24] stiff. No,
[5:03:27] no, no, no, no, no. Hard. It's making
[5:03:30] your nerves to be hard. You
[5:03:35] nervousness of one day
[5:03:39] just nervousness of one
[5:03:42] day it makes minus two years of
[5:03:46] life that's why even when you get
[5:03:50] angry you must have some
[5:03:56] limit that's why when as Jesus actually
[5:03:59] gave us a treatment
[5:04:02] How many time must I forgive my brother
[5:04:04] who sinned against me? Say 77 * 7.
[5:04:12] Yeah. It mean you are not taking out of
[5:04:14] you those
[5:04:17] substance. Now those substance that you
[5:04:20] have released into your
[5:04:25] blood, you must be able after your anger
[5:04:28] to uh recover and and and all those
[5:04:32] substance go back to where they
[5:04:35] were. If your body does not recover
[5:04:38] those substances that you
[5:04:42] that's the cause of cancers.
[5:04:46] No, no, just come now. Pray, pray,

[5:05:24] lemon. It's
[5:05:30] disconnect us from the Wi-Fi.

[5:05:38] magnetism, in the car, in the house, in

[5:05:44] phone. Yeah. That the magnetism of those
[5:05:47] vibration destroy our kidneys. It
[5:05:50] destroy our
[5:05:51] hearts. It destroy our lungs.
[5:05:56] When you wake up in the morning, you
[5:05:58] reach the first
[5:06:01] thing
[5:06:03] remove and put your your feet on the
[5:06:08] ground.
[5:06:11] Discharge electric. What? Whatever.
[5:06:16] That's what kills
[5:06:18] you. Electric because our body is
[5:06:21] electrified.
[5:06:25] Do that every
[5:06:30] day. Two teasp two teaspoon of
[5:06:36] lemon extra.
[5:06:39] two teaspoon of olive oil, extra
[5:06:47] virgin, and a a teaspoon of uh uh apple
[5:06:52] cider
[5:06:56] vinegar. Mix it together every
[5:07:00] morning before you eat your
[5:07:02] bacon, before you drink
[5:07:05] your before you take anything.
[5:07:09] Drink it every day.
[5:07:14] It's going to like release your
[5:07:19] body, your your the circulatory
[5:07:23] system, all the kings on the earth.
[5:07:27] That's what they do in the morning.
[5:07:30] That's what you don't
[5:07:34] know. Take it every
[5:07:37] morning and you will live longer. Amen.
[5:07:42] Now I closing with
[5:07:46] a what they are giving you is to just
[5:07:49] remove fear in
[5:07:51] you. It's a very small story short story
[5:07:55] little story.
[5:07:57] There was a cat and a
[5:08:01] mouse because in this world that we live
[5:08:03] we are always uh
[5:08:09] fearful what is happening in America
[5:08:12] there there's this trouble
[5:08:15] of and everyone is under
[5:08:20] pressure now they are going back to
[5:08:23] track people in the things that they did
[5:08:25] in their
[5:08:28] they they take away from you permit
[5:08:32] and now the the fear is it's it's very
[5:08:37] violent and God gave us his
[5:08:41] word and his word it's an opium for
[5:08:46] us if you are not careful with what God
[5:08:49] has given
[5:08:51] here life will be very
[5:08:54] difficult you will be always
[5:08:57] crying. God did not create us
[5:09:01] to
[5:09:03] dominance. He created us to dominate
[5:09:06] every
[5:09:13] situ. And one day the mouse was scared
[5:09:16] of the
[5:09:18] cat. And every day the cat was making
[5:09:22] the mouse uh to fear.
[5:09:25] One
[5:09:26] day the cat was
[5:09:30] outside. The mouse stepped on the table
[5:09:33] and ate the
[5:09:36] food. And as the chief was drunk, the
[5:09:39] wine uh uh
[5:09:43] the wine spilled in the
[5:09:49] food and the mouse ate a bit of a food
[5:09:54] with wine
[5:09:56] inside and the the mouse was
[5:10:00] drunk. Because when you drink the wine,
[5:10:04] the wine stimulate you.
[5:10:08] the wine makes the same h effect effect
[5:10:11] like opium.
[5:10:14] E the
[5:10:16] opium make your senses
[5:10:19] do it remove
[5:10:24] remove and now the the mouse took the
[5:10:29] wine and he was so drunk
[5:10:33] excited he went to find the
[5:10:37] cat and he's looking where is the
[5:10:41] cat even the head when he saw that
[5:10:46] red every time
[5:10:48] I he runs
[5:10:52] away
[5:10:53] I ah the mouse come I'm waiting
[5:10:57] for if
[5:11:01] wine the mouse not to be to fear the
[5:11:07] church but the wine that we have taken
[5:11:10] now it's a new wine
[5:11:13] The wine of the
[5:11:15] world make us to
[5:11:19] fight. The people are punching one
[5:11:22] another because they
[5:11:24] drink. But when you take the new
[5:11:27] one, it's the wine that makes you to hug
[5:11:30] your brother.
[5:11:33] That's why we must always drink this
[5:11:35] word of
[5:11:37] God because the word of God has a
[5:11:40] strength to forgive our
[5:11:43] enemies. That was my short
[5:11:46] advice to share with you as a medical
[5:11:50] doctor and that will help you in life.
[5:11:55] I can come to
[5:11:58] you next year. If I arrange conventions,
[5:12:02] I don't know if you going to come. Amen.
[5:12:06] Amen.
[5:12:08] If we don't meet
[5:12:09] here, we have an
[5:12:13] appointment. We bless the great
[5:12:15] inspiration of great man of God, pastor
[5:12:18] Kodima, a respectable elder.

[5:12:25] Congo. We love you so
[5:12:29] much. We know that you are a very good
[5:12:32] person.
[5:12:34] May God extend the duration of your
[5:12:39] life. Don't forget to give him that
[5:12:41] vinegar and holy oil.
[5:12:46] You will be flexible.
[5:12:50] Because the oil makes you
[5:12:53] flexible. It remove even the pain.
[5:12:57] It remove
[5:12:59] inflammation. It even reduce the
[5:13:02] process. It gives
