after the service and i will move just two for a handshake with my elders here foreign i believe we all have seen the signs that the rapture is just here around the corner all the signs are there have been a availed so we know that the lord will we will very soon be home i don't know i could say ah man i mean what do you think this morning well the sign is there the and we are following we are seeing these things and openly they are there the prophet has spoken [Music] is says it will happen immediately after the rapture it has already started he said it to me all the signs let us start by reading from luke chapter 9 [Music] our brother will read when he should believe luke chapter 9 verse 27 to 31 but i tell you of the truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he took peter and john and james and went up into a mountain to pray and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his remnant was white as clistering and behold this talked with him two men which were moses and elias who appeared in glory and speak of his disease which he should accomplish at jerusalem [Music] okay now we are going to read some things concerning these scriptures and you know brother branham says they were heavenly witnesses and the earthly witness is there now let us look at this earthly witnesses have heavenly witnesses and elijah moses and christ together theophanies how he will finish his work in jerusalem witnesses earthly witnesses where peter was there and john and james and he entered into one of the ships which was simon's and prayed him that he would trust out a little from the land and he sat down and tore the people out of the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launched out into the deep and it led and let down your nets for a drought and simon answering said unto him master we have toiled all night all the night and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net and when he had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break and they becomed unto their partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the sheeps so that they began to sink when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of the fishes which they had taken and so was also james and john the sons of zebedee which were partners with simon amen god bless you now it is very important to have these witnesses because after that we also took them up now firstly he met them at the sea lunch lunch lunch out into the dip amen now we can repeat that he is spoken after he spoken to them launched into the deep bailey all right then after that he took them up to the highest mountain they are trying to discredit the prophet else because we have already received the message it's already in us so we'll look at it how then the 144 pardons we'll start here first he was speaking to them yeah what what verse is that one let's give a safe in you first verse 31 yes who appeared in glory and speak of his disease which he should accomplish at jerusalem yes he had a work to accomplish at jerusalem the people whom he is going to accomplish that work with jerusalem amen now i said yesterday who will introduce christ because they rejected christ it is here in the scriptures they were blinded by foreign the blindness come comes he is veiled in a man as he always was veiled unto them was in his human temple god was a human form so now the prophet put it this way here in the greeks when he saw jesus christ so some saw a man [Applause] now since now we have gone we have not in the church ages now [Music] stands and in the book of revelation we will quickly find that lord i miss my my all right here here we are okay brother you can hand over that one okay but meanwhile he will bring us the rapture now 103 103 here in the book of the revelation for the rapture we a the lamb took within himself i will start here but now in this seven full book of seals the lamb took within himself now if we read in the bible it says he took the book from the one that said on the right hand side people have been guessing about it that he took the book from an old man or from his father sitting right inside and jesus christ to us i mean when the book is open now we can look up past the kittens now we find out that enoch was the seventh from new orleans all of the rest of them of the of the six men before him died all of the six churches before us is who as we we have went through we went through that yesterday i mean i i think we spoke of this rapture the bible says he walked with god prophet the amen now uh i mean the rest of them died is there's only separations and so s and i said to him well i only know of one bride of christ i don't know of pieces of the bride carlos [Applause] spoken word is the original seed spoken word is already before he left the word is now in the bride now the bride is the word you can't tear the weight into as i'm preaching [Music] that's when i am preaching you know amen god said let us make men in our life so if man is in the image of god into the word of my prophet prophet you are an amateur god amen i that is your that's why the people worship tomorrow they are not there to go but the gods will worship god [Music] [Music] but you can be worshipped hand of him that set upon the throne so the first throne was in heaven amen amen to claim his redemption as you know god was the god of the universe god is the god of the universe who is elijah the prophet of all nations they're proud a prophet to all nations he is a prophet to us he is a prophet too thank you but the spirit that god used amen then from elijah that is bright but however because it it it was elijah called the spirit of elijah that is the spirit of elijah welcome amen [Music] all right now i'm going to open here the spirit of elijah for he said the spirit of elijah or all of this gentile god on into the jewish church 438 one of the or of the gentiles 205 maybe if you can stand up you will yeah all right elijah will or the spirit of elijah then coming in to the people there for they are sent to their own people revelations or of tommy osborne over that time right okay now we let's continue with this one it says now that elijah will be a reality but the spirit of elijah the gentiles country the spirit of elijah maya aliyah time the spirit of elijah now elias are you following me jesus christ to them is [Music] okay let's have that and run the course here paragraph two two four paragraph two four then when the church is taken up that spirit that preached jesus to the gentiles to the jews that spirit now has moved to the jews is is three and a half years of satan and the holy spirit took from the gentiles and the rapture comes for the church to be taken out i just wanted us to understand that one what blinded them kings of fighting the tabernacle their bodies that blinded them and they said you are a man also can teleport blinded by the same thing and that's why once you say at least he didn't say i am if i can find a man drink a queen who is trying to be like god or something then i will know that i found a real man amen he is struggling to be like god in our images now a man will emote in the image of god shall that's why now he must be like us he must be a pharisee did you understand it i mean why he was found guilty [Music] people don't [Music] [Music] you to speak like those who were made in the likeness of god by the lord striving to be like him if i find somebody to be like god know that your inheritance is sonship is to be a son god begins gods now listen now now after that he says yes we are going to the mountain for a few minutes let us look a past what are you feeding after he took the book then that is page where is that page page 90 page 90 no no no page 90 that's when where we are talking about uh john being lifted from the church ages but i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm going back to this one when i'm at the brook is of hand of a son of the original thing and then they saw it was not supposed to be seen by satan son of god in human race and so forth what was happening in heaven there was jubilee three blocks written there um according to the things written there was in the 11th book of life amen and they saw they were looking at the book they've come together get back is he speaks of that the mystery of the seventh seer brings him back [Music] from the foundation of the world you see you've got to read between the lines [Music] then you have the seventh angel messenger interpreted that pyramid pyramid because uh it is the seventh manchester that's why our now the uh [Music] they he saw and the prophet said coming from there great tribulation you know at first was asked about them and that was two groups and the gentiles four thousand is the gentiles for four thousand that was the [Music] satan also has a reason why he left heaven now i've seen them i have studied this new church of they went from us because they were don't try to say this because uh did maybe somebody say bad things to them i was trying to put this and we climbed this mountain and they closed the service but it says now forgive me for repeating here but that's just [Music] i don't have the book here the lamb that has been slain from the foundation of the world because he qualifies [Music] after adam forfeited and he came and sprinkled brat amen i mean he says he speaks of the the gab over there the book he was kicked out of the garden again that's why the prophet came and said in the game have you asked yourself question which gap will not be butchered the the gap that was opened by adam says um to open the seals for god now this gap hello standing in the game what is that mountain sabino kenyon what happened yesterday no there's mountains and this when the prophet the seventh one the prophet and dropped into his hand that is [Music] [Applause] [Music] after partaking eating from the tree of knowledge [Applause] should be [Music] [Music] rejoice but i'm reading to you i'm reading to you then oh my what happened the shout out when brother bring them announce that the hallelujah the anointing the power the glory the manifestation hallelujah when it was announced and the old old john butler it's now i read now talk about jubilee time john must have he looked in and seen a past the kitten of time there is john john [Music] when the book did we see questions and answers on genesis page 48. and preaches jesus christ to them and the holy spirit took from the gentiles rapture comes from the church to be taken up uh i i i was trying to read this to you also that when the jews were blinded for that day how long was it the lord jesus came and the brother says prophesied right i mean now it's time for the gentiles the time of the gentiles it says now the gentile church revelation chapter seventh day chapter where he is going back to the jews i mean uh since pardon me seals do you have it since chapter pardon me i don't have all the books with me here but it's talking about him returning back i don't have my boobs elijah or the spirit of elijah [Music] the angel of the covenant where that is page 7 17 indian sins peter movie called the angel of the covenant the lord has also been blinded leonard when the jews were blinded when he is going back to the jews eyes of the gentiles blinded that's right yeah that is the unveiling of god page 34 here god [Music] that's exactly what to see he said israel goes about when the world is veiled in the human form [Music] fighting police during the tribulation period let's finish up let's let's look at it here now i repeat i'm going back to you the seventh angel came king to stand with him in the game you see brother the seventh don't do that as the television and the people are trying to say behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and their heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smile the earth with a case if that prophet is not sent to arkansas he will there on the on that mountain where we went and uh i picked up some things there luanna try and then we went to the river where the first person was baptized ohio river ohio then they pointed out out to us that the first man was baptized around this area yeah that i i don't know that's my manner of doing things it's like already keeping as memorial now to close this now don't try it now was kind expected with the jews come please amen somebody was beaten for preaching jesus to the jews we don't know that man they are losing their balance concerning the message and while this is happening now that is an old [Music] him certainly they did they can't need to leave they are not dead and they had never died they are mortals so they are just in a glorified state waiting for that time come back and preach exactly three and a half years under the anointing under the anointing of the baptism of the holy ghost taken from the gentiles and and the bible said they are they were killed in the great street baptizing them in the name of the lord jesus christ they were you know they come back from the mountain but after that it was a mountain meeting they spoke about it so you know it comes through a certain diseases and all that and all that is the new world whatever you do but whenever [Music] that scripture therefore rejoice ye heavens and he that dwell in them that's right you rejoice ye heavens and tells you these are the raptured he was talking to the raptured therefore rejoice ye heavens and he that dwell in them who to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea right the earth and then see le fassi the word and the sea you know even the beast shall come out of there see elizabeth [Music] i was blasted left and right for talking about the underworld left and right he spoke of heaven what did john say chapter 5 yes and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them had i saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and earth what about the sea there in the sea read it they and under the earth and such as are in the sea who are they in the sea all right the lord jesus when he died his souls went down here is another [Music] who knows without keys as a night ki at that time it is just like this sea thing enos satan was in hell burn the judgment the fire will start right now satan is there the bible says jesus when he died so we went down to uh to hell away and then he started the journey back he he came back with abraham lord abraham and abraham who are they jacobs you know talk upon a neighbor don't worry amen but then the prophet said that the way of the tribulation but the bride of christ will be somewhere else what i will literally that's that's that he says rejoice you know i asked brother who are they in heaven he said the and then who to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knows that he has but a short time amen i mean now you see of these three places in heaven rejoice but go to the inhabitants and john also speaks of those three realms right you mean the the beast itself listen to the person out of the sea situation i mean [Music] do you know that it's better by you today we won't talk about that but it has even come to the influence the churches today is a pasta to be a prophet today you just go to nigeria maybe for a month for it depends [Music] and that's why foreign you've got to go for a ritual i just blow you down you know what then i have seen one swinging a coach like this [Applause] we have the the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he have part a short time right right [Music] the sea is also going to bend with fire we have been visiting places no of these things we had to visit the dams people operating from the mountains demons are everywhere and now they are occupied in churches amen we saw now so that the church [Music] so we have paid the deposit deposit sleep but i won't tell you the business how did you pay for this yes no because we are sick using math well brother did you see jesus going around with matt in the bottles for teddy run or what else he says no i know at one time he was uh trying to he was showing something he kind of waiting come to jesus it's our jesus nobody did you know after [Music] okay now in the uh during the tribulation period only the 144 000. 144 000. not after we went through that they will preach to the jews during the tribulation they will preach to them in the name of jesus jesus this is the thing they are rejecting even now and they will preach to the jews you know how revelation 11 says they will then they will be killed i will send my two witnesses and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three-score days clothed insect cloth these are the two olive trees and the two cantaloupe sticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed this have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to tend them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritualists called sodom and egypt where also our lord was crucified how it ended up there verse 9 they were taken and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer their bodies their dead bodies to be put in graves and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make mary and shall send gift one to another because these two prophets tormented them and dwelt on the earth and after three days and a half the spirit of life from god entered into them and they stood up upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them amen you see that's how it will end up before they are enemies now lastly after this now we see the gospel now been preached we this is coming to the millennium millennium 144 thousands of four thousand which our jehovah witnesses claim to be jehovah witnesses and so forth now here the last part of it is paragraph 38 to 39 217 if it is there paragraph 38 these three classes of people eddie you that's when they say you will seal your salvation with your own blood because beast will introduce they are preparing machinery to chop off the heads [Music] the bible says jesus shall come now i was told that it is even written in a book and they have already prepared a hallelujah now satan has promised and there is this girl also she operates from [Music] cape point okay amen now after this firstly do you have the six-fold page 77 where it says here he comes with the bride i don't know if you don't have it i will code it 77 paragraph 133 after the tribulation period where now the moses and elijah moshe preached to them the the same ministry that we have received and yet they shall be killed yes paragraph 133 sixfold purpose now after this the bride appears after the 70 weeks the bride appears in revelation the 19th chapter she arrives with her bridegroom the mighty king oh my i don't know whether we are going to get it all or not let's just read part of this anyhow here's where the bride will come after this after the millennium sets in then christ come back with the pride right now c-o-d mostly 217-17 paragraph 38-39 all right what happened after all one now one thousand years millennium and millennials the restoration yes now listen to what will happen to the 144 000. and then actually the hundred and forty four thousand jews they are the remnant of the jewish church and the jehovah witness dog shine which puts them as the bride i don't see how you could do that because it's not the bride i guess you will notice over they had not defiled themselves with women that god had taken out of the elected of the jews and 1 217 paragraph 38 to 39 we are closing brethren don't join yes that is that the one and the 221 did we read that one paragraph 72 273 they are eunuchs 72 after this now here comes the bride [Music] they are just a hundred and forty four thousand give up a hundred and forty four thousand a little sport i mean one hundred and forty four hundred four thousand have become the eunuchs amen amen that is it behold i will send you elijah he will amen i mean are you through are you through is the escort to the bright the temple eunuchs over here to the 14th [Applause] just [Applause] they're 144 144 000 wherever they're bright amen [Applause] and we see in the new jerusalem [Music] and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold of the dragon and that all serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be lost a little season and i saw thrones and they set upon them and judgment was given unto them and so and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years yes but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were fit were finished this is the first resurrection okay one hundred and forty four thousand one hundred and twenty four thousand they were sealed amen with us god's seal [Music] to take you further now but we just want to thank god so far we have seen moses and elijah we have seen how they preach the very same gospel that we preach orally they brought the people back to jesus he saw both the one hundred and forty four thousand hundred and forty four thousand and the gentile sleeping vigin that will be the last scripture to read after this i beheld in law a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands and cried with a loud voice saying salvation of our god which seateth upon the throne and unto the lamb and all the angels stood round about the throne and above the el and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshiped god saying amen blessings and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power okay my brother let's let's keep to this pattern
