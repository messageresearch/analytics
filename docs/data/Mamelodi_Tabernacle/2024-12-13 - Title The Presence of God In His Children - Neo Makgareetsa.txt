Description:
Title: The presence of God in His Children 
Text: The power of your presence amongst the People  
Preached by Elder Neo Makgareetsa on 08 December 2024 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

Act 5:14-29

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the presence of God in his Children. 

When God has visited you, you will no longer be an ordinary person. We need to know where God is, the God whom we worship is in Us. We need to believe in one another. 
Peter was a man sent from God, and he was not aware of the things happening around him, but the people around him told him that he was not the same. The shadow of Peter had the power to heal the sick. 
God is God of the present times, you need to check what the Lord is doing today, we need to recognize the message of our time and believe in it. 
The grace of God upon the people is the 11th commandment. 

You cannot satisfy all the people, if you try to do that you will fail. When you preach, you must preach what the Lord has put into your heart, others will believe it and others will not believe it. 
When you recognize the gift and believe in it you will be healed. 
God visit us differently and we all have different experience with God. There are some people who are just born to deny things. 

The Word of God is beyond the nature. 

You need to have your own personal experience with God. There are things that you see and know which are working for you, you must stick to that and not try to impress other people. 

Every person is born with a Gift from God, you need to use that gift appropriately. There will be people who will try to influence you but if you know what you believe in you will stay in the line. 

The presence of God in you is the presence of God in the people. Stand in what is your purpose and be not afraid of what the people will say.
Every deceases is a demon, no demon can stand in front of God. 
You must fear the prayer of a woman; when they pray, they pray wholeheartedly. God find it obligated to answer t...

present Lord we know Lord God that you never disappointed us at any time you are always with us you are always within us that's why we live what we know and what we had this morning and found this place be a better place for us to be may you condescend Lord God as we are going to read the portion of this scripture bless the we bless the listeners bless myself and our precious brother interpreter my special prayer once more this morning Lord God is about the families we know Lord God the devil doesn't want to see the families of the children of God progressing and dining them themselves upon the word of God but we know and we believe that you are the restorer may you restore Heavenly Father may you visit all the men and women in the word of God so that they can just be borned again as families we know heavenly father if something is in our heart and we say it from this Pulpit it will be happen exactly as it says because it's the platform that you use to speak to us bless each and every individual heavenly father I once more pray for our our kids at school there's a lot of peer pressure where our kids day in day out are going astray living the word of God know knowing the direction or what to do may you Lord God put them together and realize the faith that have from their parents I remember once upon a time you were talking through Paul to Timothy that the faith you have from your grandmother Louise and your mother Unice I see it in you and you should continue with it that should also Lord go to go to our children because out there is dog eating dog the message is the only absolute for our kids bless them Heavenly Father open their spiritual eye may they focus on what us as the parents has believed because it's the only thing that has stay make us to stay in the word and is the only thing that will take us to Eternity Heavenly Father we love you so much you never disappointed us Lord that is why we will appreciate each and every moment that we have given unto our life Heavenly Father all the prayer requests all the Thanksgiving you know they come from you Heavenly Father you have done to the children of God and everything should be done according to your word according to the way you have prepared them before the foundation of the world for We Believe Heavenly Father nothing new in this life history repeat itself those that believe you in the previous time we shall believe you today and going forward we will always Ponder ourself upon this way we love you so much we appreciate you so much as we put Lord God everything unto your capable hand in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen let's read from the book of Acts chapter 5 [Music] verse 14- 16 amen and Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them there came also a multitude out of the Cities round about unto Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were infected with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone amen you may take your seat half of the quotes that I'm going to read here is praying amen amen my message this morning will be about the presence of God in his children I saw brother here I preached this message in L we were together that time so it's double portion for him this morning but my subtitle will be the power of your presence amongst the people people a CH a child of God is not just somebody who is ordinary but you are special you are present the people feel it because you were in the presence of God it's God first who bring his presence amongst us after that we see ourselves having the presence of God until when the people see us they see us differently amen amen Peter was ordinary but at the later stage he was no longer ordinary it was something else when God has visited you you are no longer ordinary you are Beyond ordinary you are no longer not just a human being you become a super human being until the people say there is one amongst us who is not like unto us that's a children of God Amen am H we we read here you know Peter when he was just a fisherman he was just like others but the day the Holy Ghost descended upon him the day he was transformed Jesus gave him a commission that the day you are transformed you shall strengthen your brothers so the strength that Peter had was to Cascade it to the others so when the people get strength they must get it from Peter because Lord God said the day you was transformed strengthen your brothers we need to know where God is let's not lie to one another let's tell the truth amongst one another God to whom you worship is in amongst us other people they just want to worship God who is in heaven but the very same God they Worship in heaven is here in us but if is in a man it becomes a stumbling block to other people you you read the whole chapter here you will see how it goes so Peter was just a man sent from God and he started preaching the word of God and he was not even aware of some of the things happening around him but the people made him aware that Peter you are no longer the same the person you used to be you are not that person anymore you are something else amen when you read here it says the Believers were more Ed and they came in multitude both men and women and they brought forth the seed into the street and lay them on the bed and coaches that at least the shadow of Peter might not overshadow SM overshadow some of them Peter was not aware said power he was not aware at all but the people made him aware that Peter if you can stand here and let the people pass by your Shadow they will be healed Peter was just standing there they said yes because the children of God has got in them Peter stood there the people passed and they were healed and the Bible says even the evil spirit went out of them from the shadow of Peter and that was the thing that happened first time since the world [Music] began I want to show you something we believe this because we read it but we fail to see our present time take your shad and let the people pass no one will not be no one will be healed it's not the time of the Shad is something else God is God of the present time we need to lift him out of History if Peter sh heal the people rebuke the demons try today it will never work but you need to check what God is doing today amen if Jesus used the cl to heal the people try today it's not going to work you need to know the message of your time you you must recognize the message of your time what God is doing at your time you read the scripture from 17 going down let's just read it then the high priest rose up and all that were with him which the sect of the SES amen and were filled with indignation you can read it verse 17 amen they were angry Peter what are you doing what is your Shad of doing what are youying to do amen amen and lay their hands on the Apostle and put them in the common prison amen when they laid hands on them they were beaten them not just L amen but the angel of the Lord by Night opened the prison door and brought them forth and say go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of life when you stand with this gospel in times of Sorrow this gospel will stand for you and when they had that they entered into the temple early in the morning and Tau but the high priest came and they were with him and called the council together and all the Senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them bought but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told saying the prison truly found we shut with off safety and the keeper standing without before the doors but when we had open we found no man within now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priest had these things they doubted of them where unto this will grow then came one and told them saying behold the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people you cannot stop the word of God Our God has never failed when God goes forward he goes forward no one can stop him they tried to stop them but the angel of God being God himself he came to their rescue and let them go on teaching the people about the word of God then verse 299 Peter said to them and the others Apostle answered and said we ought to obey God rather than [Music] me amen then it ends like that but the people of that time because they never had this kind of an experience they couldn't see how God operates but the others that God knew and make them to believe they believed the message of that time you need to know the message of your time then the shadow of Peter became a solution to the people the people were too many he couldn't pray to them one by one a man of God just stand when they pass they get healed and the demons are gone forever amen amen you know a law is always a problem thou shall not thou shall not that is why brother BR came and preached about the 11th commandment amen the sovereignity of God when Grace take over because the Lord has failed the grace of God upon the people is the 11th commandment we are on the 11th commandment where the law of God I mean the grace of God is upon us so the priests the Senate the children of Israel they stick to the law and in the law they never saw a Shad healing the people it was a hindrance to them they decided to beat them put them in prison God take them out they continue preaching the word of God if the people stop you continue preach the word of God you cannot satisfice all the people amen if you try you will fail this thing started in heaven a person who created heaven and Earth all the people have seen how powerful he was but others just deny him who are you today for you to let everybody to believe your message can be it has never be it will never be amen even today when I preach others they don't believe but others believe is natural that is why when you preach don't please the people give what God has put in your heart give to the church those that believe will believe those that do not believe it's none of my business [Music] amen amen that's how things are we see it in our families we see it in our work premises we see it in the churches we saw it in heaven others did not believe but others believe this morning others will believe others will never believe I'm telling you an honest truth sometimes we need to tell these things and not sugar goat things and not deceive one another others will believe others will never believe Amen brother in the message do you believe he he was praying when he prayed he said and now we pray that you will bless this handkerchief and we taught that in the Bible they took a handkerchief off of the body of Paul they leted them on the seek evil spirit went out amen we know we are not St Paul but we know that thou art still Christ so we pray that you honor this prayer of this church group of the people believing tonight and we send this hanger Chief to the sick and the needy in the name of your child Jesus Christ and God bless you he was praying brother and he knew what Paul did and now this time he know what God will be doing amen one day God said to brother if you can let the people believe in you amen believe in brother BR but the people will come and will say we don't believe in brother B we want to believe in God but when they go to God God said to them believe in brother Bren God whom you worship is here believe amongst ourselves for God is here amen that's that's a human being when you go this way he will try to be contrary going that way for you for him to prove that you are just nothing amen but we know God has never failed let's continue then they took the handkerchiefs and the apron from Paul and got healed that's how they got salvation on that day amen but try the handkerchief today they will never work it's not the time of Paul it's another dispensation you need to know what God has in store for you amen let's continue and we do not believe that it was Paul that did this it was your spirit Lord answering the faith of the people and today there's the same need same cry you're the same God May the results come for we commit them to thee amen for that purpose thou did this hand of this audience what you did to the audience you know the heart of everyone may they receive just what they ask for granted Lord he us now it was brother Bram praying and the the very same prayer should roll down to us today and have the same experience amen Amen brother Brenham brother was praying for another sister again and he said almighty God I pray and I realized that the Brazen serpent didn't pray for anyone the the water that was troubled didn't pray for anyone the woman who touched the H of Jesus wasn't praying for the ones that laid in the shadow of Peter wasn't pray for the ones who had the anchor Chief taken off from were not prayed for but God they got well because they believed and recognized your gift amen amen again I'm read this quote I'm going to show you something here brother Brenham he he saw a sister in a prayer life the picture had a the sister had a picture and he said I see you got one of the pictures that's very fine I just want to speak to you for a moment and let's talk on the picture just a moment amen then he give a testimony brother B he said and after that little Pillar of Fire that you see there sometimes ago there was a miracle perform a lady put it in a picture many of them put it in a frame go to the 10 cent store go to the 10 cent store and they put it in a little frame and put it something behind any anybody asked about it and she had it sitting on her her desk at the hospital sister was sick at the hospital and she was looking not at me of course but at the pillar of fire there and she's claim this is a testimony the doctor give her up to die she claimed that the pillar of fire came out of the pit and hung over head and two days later she was dismissed from the hospital and went home well I I I just want to share this with the children of God that my experience with God it's not your experience with God your experience with God is not the experience with that person with God God visit us differently this sister took saw a picture of brother BR that had a p of fire she saw it and realize that she can benefit from that but other people it's just a useless picture to them and the picture took the sister took the picture put it on the desk and believed de there in that picture there's a pillar of fire and one of the days when the doctor examine her they said to him you are just waiting to die but sister look at the picture and they saw the pillar of fire leaving the picture coming to her and she got healed but try it today it will not happened because it's not your experience it was the experience of the sister those that thing is not working for them it's nothing Moses put the Brazen serpent he said children of Israel for you to leave look there those that looked they lived those that didn't they did amen am there are people that are just SP to deny no matter you tell the truth they will just deny because they were born to deny until the Bible says there are those that were born to be damed it's a saying but imagine you were born to die to damed there was another young man brother said to don't let this young man get married because if he can get married he bring H in the fam what did Brother Bram see was a prophet that is why some other marriages today are not working we need to check that they were supposed to get married or not it's not easy amen amen I when I was at work they normally say hey if you want to go home you don't look bad I say oh you don't know Africans when other men working far from their homes they enjoy them when they have time to go home they go sad they drive 60 on the road in 120 km hour because when they get home they just rebuke the wife the kids R to the to the rooms the is here the lion is in the house hey brothers we need to change when you get to your house be a lamb but at work you can be a lion re all of them when you get home all the kids and the wives they must get together in one table share meal together together because it live the B I'm not saying because of just saying I'm telling you the truth we are closing on Wednesday for December holidays the men are scratching their head are you going home they didn't want to be at their homes in the beginning you don't know what why they get married if you don't enjoy in your house tell us the truth where are you enjoying amen now this sister saw something that even the doctors couldn't see in the hospital the doctor said we are just giving you few days to die then the sister said if I can just look at that Pillar of Fire andove from the picture stay in my head I will be healed the word of God is beyond the doctor report we see here when Peter was talking brother even say Peter couldn't sign his SI nature he didn't have education but the people the Senators the high priest the people in the government couldn't see what Peter see they didn't know what he knows because what Peter head was beyond nature if you have something that is beyond nature you will have an absolute in your life the doctors will fail the high priest will fail the Jews and the Pharisees will fail they couldn't see what you see there are things that you see there are things that you know but there other people they not see and they don't know stick to what you see what you know is what God has called you for don't try to please me don't try to please any [Applause] man I'm going to read what you think I know what you thinking and other people thought about this and they died listen to brother unconditional Covenant that God made his people amen after this he said she just looked at that and believed we know to look at that any other way any other way will be like idolatry I'm going to repeat this maybe you will understand it we know to look at that any other way like be Idol if I can believe that this water in the class can heal me I'm not saying I'm going to worship the water in the because me amen Amen brother Bram will talk about a special testimony what God is doing at that moment amen you get it then he said and may each time you look at them you remember tonight at the platform that the same Pillar of Fire on that picture you standing right in the present now and that is right you in his presentence the presence of God became the present of men your present among the people is the present of God Among the people I'm reading another testimony here brother Bram says in Memphis one day Memphis is a place in America MH Yes you heard me tell it I guess I just thought of it I was coming singing that little song the airplane had stopped a storm came up right before night and I was coming from over Dallas Texas it stopped at Memphis storm brought it down and they put up in the big hotel they put me up in the big hotel told me next morning they'll call me 7:00 and I was going to mail some male real early about 5:00 it's not male male like I I didn't sleep too much and on the road down there the holy spirit said turn and go back the other you know the story when I was reading the story I said God you are a good God nothing is impossible before one day this woman never had kids he prayed God that he should give me a kid then he gave him he gave him a baby boy and a baby boy grew up like other boys but somewhere along the way as I was talking about the children at school had the peer pressure and then she he goes astray amen now the woman prayed and say Lord God I don't want my child to be like this I hope mothers I hope mothers you pray for your kids amen amen then when he was she was praying he said Lord God I remember in the Bible there was a shite woman that might woman never had children and there was a man the man of God called Elijah and today I'm standing here like a sh might woman I need Elijah to and rescue me in the situation I am was a colored woman a colored woman in America or a Col in America negro black people a black woman amen grounded the airplane when she was praying God came down and found it oblate to answer the prayer of this woman when Elijah was flying there he caused the storm God caused the storm for the plane to come down when he comes down he said to brother Bren just go around brother B was going around he get to the shop a shop of guns he looked when he was looking God said to him go this

hey you cannot fool God you will forever appreciate God he's doing one for us don't don't be afraid don't be scared to stand for your purpose the people rather hate you because you were born for a purpose that God has called you the people may talk out there but stick to what God has put you know you can please the people after pleasing the people they can disappoint you those that had money they know you can call him bzel make them money let them win do this and this when you are broke you will know how human being don't be a man pleas speak for what has God and brother Bram brother bam when he there in the house he was looking at the boy when he was looking at the boy then he said to momy talk to him then the woman said no I can't talk to him he doesn't hear me he doesn't even know me he doesn't even know you he's not even looking at us he's in another world then brother said to the woman the woman started to pray amen amen the woman pray in front of brother after the prayer says that's a genuine prayer let me pray let me pray as the man of God because for me to come here for God to ground that airplane it was for a prayer for me to offer a prayer so let me pray the man of God prayed then he prayed then after the prayer he asked the woman what was wrong with the with the son then she he started to to to explain the kind of disease that the son had he said he has venial disease okay that turned into cytic you know what is venial disease amen is HIV and AIDS yes the boy started to run around with and she contact he contacted there then he was worse until he lost his mind then brother Bram said well every disease you can call it name CTIC CTIC you you you you can even be proud of this terminology but it's a demon every disease is a demon every disease a demon When you pray casting out demons no demon can stand before God amen amen and then the flight the brother was under you know a kind of a stress desperation no the flight is about to go I'm late already with 2 hours 3 hours and there at the airport they were calling him William maram the flight is going but God said wait until the work is complete you know God can change the [Music] [Applause] circumstances the people say if there is one thing you need to fear you must fear a prayer of a woman amen amen when the women pray they pray wholehearted as men we think we can explore but when a woman pray you go in the Old Testament and look at the women when they pray it's not men who pray to have kids no no no it's women they pray and after their prayer angel of God will come fear a prayer of a woman [Applause] come the first thing is the food yes I'm going whe you but a prayer of a woman her husband was out work but this woman feel like I must have a baby son she even told God there's a woman in the Bible woman that thing if is true that history repeat itself Let It Be unto me today I'm a shite woman today I need here today make brother Bram to visit that and brother BR pray for that after the prayer the woman say thank God you visited my house you visited my house things will be okay in the house amen amen now the boy was fine that boy show the doctors as well and the doctor said you are just but waiting for death but that is a doctor but wait until a man of God visited your house a little while about a year that I was going through Phoenix Pho I come on a train you know how sandwiches are on train they so high and little pity things so we pulled into Memphis and I jumped off and get a SE of hambers for to last me till I got about to Phoenix and Soo we be that day and that night and I get them there off about 15 cent a piece and I was get me a CLE full hamburgers I went and I went to get them run down like that and I heard somebody or another hello there person I looked right a little red kept standing over there I said hello there how are you brother I keep on keep on going if you don't know they just you and he also and he said wait a minute I said do you know me and he said no I don't I don't believe I do brother he said you remember one time said you come down to my house and said my mama was standing out there at the gate waiting down over there or something brother bam said you not that boy he said I am hallelujah amen we see our testimony that boy was super healthy brother could not even recognize him then he said the doctor done all his well and said not only that but I'm saved now amen amen when you ask the salvation of your children wholeheartedly like this woman God answer amen amen now the boy was happy the mother was happy the father was happy and father even the father when he AR things can happen he don't see what this woman has see he don't see what this son is see amen amen then there was now joy in the house the present of brother BR in that house was the present of God your are present wherever you are is the present of God because God present has come down to you when you go you carry the present of God you become the present of God I think it was in 1994 or4 I attended the service there in bitley Pastor was preaching then when he was preaching gave the testimony he said one day he heard about brother Bram then he was staying here in juc then they drove down to kimbery they were friends when they get there they packed their car when they packed their car they saw the tent where brother bam was preaching then they came out of the car and approach he was saying an old man when he goes found himself going on suspense when he approached he found himself on suspense when he get there he was already in tears then he was saying to us that present you couldn't stand for it amen amen where brother Bram was was the present of God then that time he led his life to Christ until his departure he stood for the cause he believed in amen so that's how the word of God goes we need to stick to what we believe in don't be men Pleasers amen amen you see H the comrades they went to Exile together you understand they come back they get the government guess what some are in jail some are investigated some some assassinated that's comradeship of the world but with the word of God you stand for what you believed in our p is in the house he's streaming but you know his influence as we here is beyond your thinking the Pres of the men of God is the present of God no matter what the world say stick to that I know there are pictures of the pastor of the light others have others do not have those that have if it's working for them so be it if that picture is not working for you it's none of my business because the shadow of Peter has worked for the people but the others were dying there because they denied the power that was in Peter a handerchief of Paul work for others the of brother of fire work for others that didn't they died there but sister survived the prayer of the sister brought down the plane down here don't convince me to believe what you believe I need to have my personal experience with God don't recruit me because I know what I believe amen it's something is waiting for me it's not working for you don't try amen to make me to believe what you believe I you know every person has Bor with a gift from God that gift you have from God use it appropriately there will be people that will try to divert you but if you are careful if you know your position you will to the line you stay for what we believe in amen amen I'm reading the last quote here God's provided way brother Bram says he said now we can preach the way explain the way but you have to receive the way if you do not receive the way it's not helping me in any because the word has been preached the word is been explained but you as an individual you must receive it so that it can be in your heart when you receive it it's the Revelation something slipped out of the Unseen World come rolling down through a mystical Channel somewhere into your soul say now I see your eyes brighten your lips that hang straighten up and a smile every muscle in your body seem to Rejoice something is going to happen you don't need to be in a prayer life then you got it there brother Bram here is telling us he is not saying the church he's saying to an individual something from from from Unseen World will come roll right in your heart when it's in your heart it's you and God you and God no that person can try amen to move you out of there amen am in the Old Testament the children of Israel they were taught when they leave the hand of Moses they shall receive Victory amen amen if they can say they I will and leave their hands down they got defeated the best thing they must leave those hands leave the hands of the men of God you shall receive Victory if you let them go down you got defeated you know the focus on that wall was at the hand of Moses in your closet you can go and PR harder God will never hear that prayer because you need to lift the hands of Moses that's what he one that was the standard of the day amen amen you you remember the other time when the Israelites were at War when they were at War they were carrying a coffin going to bury it and the Bible says when the enemies come they throw that person into the you know grave where the Prophet slept he came to life when he wake up he was surprised what is happening here the people are running away he just woke up from the dead he resurrected that's how far the word of God go amen amen you need to believe the word of the time if there's a experience that God gives you in your time stick to eat you might bring the handkerchief they might not work for you you might think you are Shadow work it cannot work for others but if you have something that has God has put in our time stick to that I know pictures are many and we differ there are those preachers that will just read the Bible and everybody will say Amen are those preachers that will quote the prophet everybody will say Amen there are those preachers will go deeper in the word of God the deeper people will say Amen others will be sleeping in the CH in the church that's where you see characters the the the thing another thing most of the people hate about the message when you did not come to church we phone you and you got angry and then if you not there and then it annoys many this ones have started and when somebody is tired you will try this and that you can even put him on the chair and then he will sleep right there because you have dragged him along here we need to come to a place no one is drinking us When Sunday Come brother Bram says we can't stay at all you wait for them gazes to get open wait for the door to get open because this is the right place to be that's why we worship Him amen amen but those that do not you know I I love God and God has never made a mistake with with our naked eye we may look at things differently and think things could have happened this way but God has start them [Music] differ as D was saying something you know some of the things you may feel pity but you know God knows all there's a reason behind it we don't know God knows and God has never disappointed but God want them in this way who are we to blame God as I was saying somebody threatened me the other day that you will kill me said well if I died today doesn't matter are you going to live 100 years the point is if I die today sooner or later you will be buried what you benefited I'm not scared of death and when I say this I know my wife doesn't like it because every time when I drive I say two things when I come back home alive let's praise God when I come back home with a coffin so be itat we live to die as long as raptes we shall see him through death don't be scared of death don't be scared of criticism stay for the cause that God has put you in there's a reason behind that Moses was born to take the children of Israel out of Jordan Beyond Jordan is Joshua even if he would love to be there physically but God said you end here the day you were born the day you will die only God who knows about them we don't know what is telling us is this we must just always be ready that's all God bless you let's stand to our feet and our quot amen amen amen [Music] [Music] [Music] be [Music] re [Music] God [Music] [Applause] [Music] every [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen [Music] [Applause] amen if you can just
