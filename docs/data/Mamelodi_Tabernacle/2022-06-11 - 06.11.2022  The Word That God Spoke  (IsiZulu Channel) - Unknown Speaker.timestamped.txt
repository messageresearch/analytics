[1:39:11] which one lipi that goeth
[1:39:15] a lipoma
[1:39:17] out of my mouth

[1:39:42] social my way be that because
[1:39:50] out of my mouth
[1:39:54] it shall not return unto me again
[1:40:19] I'm in I remember one day
[1:40:26] Queenstown and I
[1:40:30] my brother there
[1:40:32] were residing there
[1:40:37] that evening
[1:40:42] I thought Lord
[1:40:48] foreign
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:41:01] is then I said all right
[1:41:07] so shall my weight be that goeth forth
[1:41:11] out of my mouth
[1:41:14] then I said Lord there's a request here
[1:41:17] and
[1:41:21] I was thinking that how am I going to
[1:41:24] what am I going to preach about it
[1:41:28] now finally
[1:41:31] these people are your beings your sons
[1:41:51] that he said to the Lord
[1:41:54] these people are yours
[1:41:57] if you pray your presence do not remain
[1:42:01] with us
[1:42:03] we shall not
[1:42:06] foreign
[1:42:36] if God has noticed promise to speak
[1:42:39] don't move
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:44] amen
[1:43:00] so now
[1:43:02] I had a special message
[1:43:06] last time they asked me to come
[1:43:11] to continue
[1:43:16] uh what was it
[1:43:19] remember the message
[1:43:21] going in
[1:43:28] no no no
[1:43:29] you are still here I'm talking about us
[1:43:38] the last message we preached there
[1:43:42] um
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:51] okay clingy
[1:43:54] no all right
[1:43:57] so I had to change to this now
[1:44:05] talk about it
[1:44:09] you know he came as air some mediator
[1:44:17] I I I won't say you'll be surprised to
[1:44:21] know that we are going to read where he
[1:44:23] is no longer a mediator
[1:44:31] um
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:34] when we hit that place again
[1:44:45] speak about this word yeah
[1:44:49] God has spoken
[1:44:52] now I want to read from
[1:44:55] the spoken word is the original seat is
[1:45:04] page
[1:45:06] 29. a paper
[1:45:09] I don't know because sometimes
[1:45:32] here is the word lying here
[1:45:39] now what happened
[1:45:41] here is the weight now is the word that
[1:45:44] God spoke
[1:45:46] to multiply and replenish the Earth
[1:45:51] it couldn't find a place now
[1:45:58] amen and now what
[1:46:01] God spoke
[1:46:04] was moving please
[1:46:12] I wonder why we are preaching here
[1:46:17] is the word finding a place now
[1:46:21] because the world has a place
[1:46:31] [Music]
[1:46:33] amen and beauty
[1:46:36] you
[1:46:37] should be the place of the way
[1:46:42] will read in the Bible that David was a
[1:46:46] place of the words
[1:46:49] [Music]
[1:46:50] and God is
[1:46:53] of the day
[1:47:00] is
[1:47:03] a place
[1:47:08] amen when it is
[1:47:15] all right
[1:47:17] now finally
[1:47:23] says when I speak about
[1:47:26] God's Prophet I want you to know which
[1:47:29] one
[1:47:31] um
[1:47:36] this word it caught into
[1:47:40] lilies
[1:47:44] meaning this word was traveling
[1:47:49] from back there
[1:47:53] and when it couldn't find a place
[1:47:57] the first woman
[1:48:11] because a place it must find a place
[1:48:22] amen because God
[1:48:25] it's not speaking out he is not not
[1:48:28] speaking alone amen
[1:48:33] no teasing and
[1:48:36] that is
[1:48:43] God can come into you bodily
[1:48:49] he comes in the word form amen
[1:48:55] I'm
[1:48:56] that's why Inga Court wants to talk to
[1:49:00] us in this age
