[24:32] Jesus Christ.
[24:34] Uh this is a joyful day.
[24:38] uh we shall come and rejoice.
[24:43] Uh there is a scripture in the Bible
[24:45] that says
[24:48] let us all rejoice
[24:51] for the marriage of the lamb has come.
[24:55] So whenever there is a marriage
[24:59] it's time for rejoicing.
[25:02] So can we show that we are rejoicing?
[25:07] Okay.
[25:09] Amen.
[25:11] Uh
[25:13] I think uh the the people of the day are
[25:18] not yet here because I don't see someone
[25:22] here looking like them.
[25:28] You want to see more handsome and
[25:32] beautiful
[25:34] &gt;&gt; to start coming in.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. I I'm given a great
[25:38] responsibility.
[25:40] [Laughter]
[25:44] So I will start by welcoming the
[25:46] ministers here and the elders
[25:51] that have come to to give me the
[25:55] opportunity to stand here and be the
[25:59] marriage uh officer this morning.
[26:03] [Music]
[26:05] May God bless you all men of God. And
[26:10] can we just give a hand of appreciation
[26:13] [Music]
[26:13] [Applause]
[26:15] Amen.
[26:17] It could have been one of them doing it,
[26:21] &gt;&gt; but they have handed over to me.
[26:25] But may God bless them richly.
[26:29] And now before we start everything,
[26:32] before we start anything,
[26:35] uh we would like to make a way for the
[26:39] people of the day to be inside here.
[26:45] Because we have made all these
[26:47] movements,
[26:50] all these arrangements,
[26:53] all these travelings
[26:55] just for them
[26:58] as the Bible says
[27:01] that marriage
[27:03] should be honored
[27:06] by all men. And that's why we are here
[27:09] this morning.
[27:11] Uh they have gone through a long
[27:13] journey.
[27:14] [Music]
[27:15] Yes.
[27:17] Prayers,
[27:19] consecration,
[27:21] decisions.
[27:23] And here is the day.
[27:26] They have honored us.
[27:29] They have honored the parents.
[27:32] They have honored the community.
[27:35] They have honored the church.
[27:38] They have shown a great example.
[27:42] So it is now time for us
[27:45] to show how much we appreciate them,
[27:49] how much we honor them.
[27:52] So if maybe you are not happy,
[27:55] I want you to help us
[27:59] by going outside.
[28:03] Amen.
[28:06] I'm serious.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Here inside
[28:10] We only want happy people.
[28:15] If you have a problem,
[28:17] you can go outside.
[28:20] If you are mourning,
[28:22] you can go outside.

[28:54] to take videos and photos
[28:57] but I see there is some arrangements
[29:01] for people who are more professional.
[29:04] [Music]
[29:05] So please do not obstruct them.

[29:30] want to see faces. I just want to see
[29:33] teeth of people.

[48:06] &gt;&gt; If you don't want to learn, if you don't
[48:08] want to learn, you are jealous.
[48:13] Amen.
[48:14] [Applause]
[48:16] You know the first person to be kicked
[48:19] out of heaven,
[48:24] it was because of jealousy.
[48:26] [Music]
[48:28] So if we find you jealous here,
[48:33] we kick you out.
[48:35] Amen.
[48:37] Praise the Lord.
[48:39] Amen. Okay, just before we start.
[48:43] Uh
[48:45] for us, everything begins with the word
[48:51] because in the beginning was the word
[48:55] and the word was with God
[48:58] and the word was God.
[49:01] So we we will begin with the word.
[49:06] The word of God is the foundation.
[49:10] and the capstone
[49:13] of every marriage.
[49:16] Any marriage which is not done according
[49:20] to the word of God
[49:26] is not a marriage.
[49:28] So we will start with scripture.
[49:32] We are still standing.
[49:35] Uh if I can have time somewhere here
[49:40] uh something that can help me to check
[49:43] time
[49:45] so that I don't take your yours
[49:51] just use my own time.
[49:55] I don't want to take your time.
[50:00] In weddings people come and say the food
[50:02] was cold.
[50:06] Ah, that pastor took long.
[50:10] I don't want to be blamed after the
[50:13] wedding.
[50:16] In fact, the time you'll be blaming me,
[50:18] I'll be in the aeroplane.
[50:23] No, that's when it's not working. It's
[50:25] okay. Thank you. Thank you. God bless
[50:27] you.
[50:29] The first book we can read is the book
[50:32] of Genesis.
[50:36] Genesis chapter 2
[50:41] uh when the first wedding happened.
[50:48] Amen. That was the first one.
[50:53] Amen. And we have the today one
[50:59] is showing us what will be the last one.
[51:06] So Noah and Hana,
[51:09] you are right in the middle
[51:13] between the first wedding
[51:16] and the last wedding
[51:19] and you are showing us the image
[51:24] so that we see and understand
[51:27] what was done in the Bible.
[51:31] and we have the revelation
[51:35] of what will happen.
[51:38] Amen. Genesis chapter 2
[51:44] uh verse,
[51:47] let us just take a short one. Let's take
[51:49] it from verse 23.
[51:56] And Adam said,
[51:58] "This is now bone of my bones
[52:02] and flesh of my flesh.
[52:06] She shall be called woman."
[52:10] And she was taken out of a man.
[52:16] [Music]
[52:26] Therefore
[52:27] shall a man leave his father and his
[52:30] mother, and shall cleave unto his wife,
[52:34] and they shall be one flesh.
[52:39] [Music]
[52:49] Amen.
[52:51] Let's take also uh Matthew 19.
[52:56] [Music]
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So you will if you are a Bible
[53:02] student you will notice that there is
[53:06] the marriage topic are not is not spoken
[53:09] a lot in the Bible.
[53:16] You'll find it in the beginning of the
[53:18] Bible.
[53:20] Then you have to travel to the middle of
[53:23] the Bible
[53:26] that is Jesus
[53:28] in Matthew 19.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; And then Paul will come back to the same
[53:34] words of Jesus.
[53:38] Then you will only find it again in the
[53:40] book of Revelation
[53:43] chapter 19 again. Chapter 19.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Okay. Matthew 19.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Matthew 19.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Uh let me take just from verse four.
[53:55] And he answered and said unto them,
[53:59] "Have you not read that he which made
[54:04] them at the beginning made them male and
[54:08] female?"
[54:11] and said, "For this cause shall a man
[54:16] leave father and mother and shall cleave
[54:20] to his wife,
[54:22] and they twin
[54:24] shall be one flesh.
[54:28] Wherefore
[54:29] they are no more twin, but one flesh.
[54:33] What therefore God hath joined together,
[54:37] let no man put a sand Fore
[54:41] [Music]
[54:59] speech.
[55:09] [Music]
[55:11] Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe I can ask pastor
[55:17] you can pray for us.
[55:19] [Music]
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[55:27] Father God,
[55:29] we have gathered this morning
[55:32] to witness the wedding of Noah and Hana.
[55:37] We want to rejoice with them, Lord, and
[55:40] Jo with the family.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; We thank you for your word that what is
[55:45] happening this morning is something that
[55:48] you instituted right from the beginning.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we are witnessing.
[55:54] Lord, be with us. with the minister
[55:58] &gt;&gt; as he unveils the word for us.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; We want to rejoice together, Lord.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; That your word will stand forever.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; What was in the beginning
[56:12] &gt;&gt; is now and will be forever.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Lead us Lord in Christ Jesus name.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you pastor.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] Uh I want to ask you to sit
[56:29] the the crowd can sit first
[56:32] so that you see the couple
[56:36] before they sit down.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[56:43] I think now can we have them seated?
[56:48] We say some few words.
[57:04] Amen.
[57:06] This is how a great day looks like.
[57:11] Even the dress is different.
[57:15] You need help to carry it around.
[57:20] The look is different.
[57:23] just because the day is different.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. Shalom saints.
[57:34] Uh before we proceed into uh giving the
[57:38] blessing to this couple
[57:43] uh to live together as husband and wife.
[57:48] That's why we are here.
[57:51] for the same God who has blessed us
[57:56] in this journey
[57:58] to bless them as well
[58:01] so that they can be strong
[58:04] in the journey they about to start now.
[58:08] That's the same God who has blessed
[58:10] their parents
[58:13] to make it in the way
[58:16] because without God
[58:19] we can do nothing.
[58:22] I I I just want to say some few words
[58:26] and I know sometime the maybe it can be
[58:29] an approach that can be different
[58:32] [Music]
[58:34] but if you don't agree with me
[58:37] just bear with me and pray for me
[58:41] because today it's me who's here.
[58:46] Amen.
[58:48] So by the grace of God
[58:51] I want just to share some few things
[58:54] from the word of God.
[58:57] You we have read two scriptures.
[59:01] Uh why we are reading the Bible?
[59:05] Because marriage
[59:08] is a divine institution.
[59:22] Marriage is not a government
[59:24] institution.
[59:26] [Music]
[59:29] Marriage is not a cultural institution.
[59:35] But marriage is a divine institution.
[59:42] Amen. And the apostle Paul,
[59:47] &gt;&gt; if you look at the Bible,
[59:50] &gt;&gt; I think only mainly three men,
[59:54] three men have touch
[59:58] the the topic of marriage.
[1:00:04] The first one was Moses.
[1:00:06] [Music]
[1:00:07] Then it was Jesus.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Then it is Paul.
[1:00:13] only them.
[1:00:16] And there is a particularity with the
[1:00:18] three men
[1:00:21] that they made a visible encounter
[1:00:27] with the supernatural.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Moses met the pillar of fire.
[1:00:37] Then he was commissioned
[1:00:39] and he had the authority.
[1:00:42] to establish the rules.
[1:00:45] That's why he could speak about this
[1:00:48] great institution.
[1:00:52] [Music]
[1:00:55] Then Jesus himself
[1:00:58] God made flesh
[1:01:02] could speak about it.
[1:01:05] Then it is Paul.
[1:01:08] And Paul also
[1:01:11] like Moses
[1:01:13] met the pillar of fire.
[1:01:16] Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Beside them no one can just come and
[1:01:20] touch it.
[1:01:23] You need a special divine commission
[1:01:28] for you to touch this matter
[1:01:32] because it's the first official
[1:01:34] institution made by God
[1:01:41] like I love to say
[1:01:43] the highest covenant
[1:01:47] between men that can be established
[1:01:52] is marriage. marriage because it has got
[1:01:55] impact
[1:01:58] in your life spiritually,
[1:02:01] naturally, physically,
[1:02:05] financially.
[1:02:06] Amen. In everything,
[1:02:10] it declare as well even your destiny.
[1:02:16] Your your marriage can affect your
[1:02:18] destiny.
[1:02:23] important.
[1:02:26] Amen. It is a divine institution.
[1:02:32] And when I speak about that,
[1:02:35] I always remember there is uh the story
[1:02:39] that many of us have read
[1:02:44] about Mr. Ford.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Mr. Ford.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Ford, the one who makes the cars.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Mr. Ford
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; moving on the road
[1:02:59] with his overall
[1:03:02] and he find a young man there
[1:03:06] with a lot of uh oil in his hands
[1:03:11] going under the car, above the car, on
[1:03:14] top of the car,
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:18] trying all his best to fix.
[1:03:22] And you know when you get into a garage,
[1:03:27] the man you see dirty,
[1:03:30] you think is the one who knows the job.
[1:03:35] But most of the time,
[1:03:38] the dirtiest man
[1:03:40] is the learner.
[1:03:46] Because the one who knows the job, he
[1:03:47] know where to touch.
[1:03:50] He does not use a motor oil as a lotion.
[1:03:57] Okay, I'm just trying to make you laugh.
[1:04:01] So, Mr. Ford approached the young man,
[1:04:05] asked him, "Man, what are you doing?"
[1:04:08] I said, "No, this car is giving me
[1:04:09] problem.
[1:04:11] I bought it. Now I have to fix it every
[1:04:14] time. I've been trying here on the side
[1:04:17] of the road.
[1:04:20] But no one nothing is happening.
[1:04:23] And then Mr. Ford was wearing a suit
[1:04:28] like me.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; And he look at him and he say come from
[1:04:35] under the car.
[1:04:37] Then the man look at him. He look at his
[1:04:40] suit. Say what do you know about me?
[1:04:45] Say young man touch here.
[1:04:49] Then touch again here. Then touch there.
[1:04:53] Then go in there. Then start the car.
[1:04:57] Then when he start
[1:04:59] it was on.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Then he asked him, "Who are you?" Say,
[1:05:07] "I am Mr. Ford.
[1:05:09] I am the engineer,
[1:05:12] the conceiver,
[1:05:14] the conceiver
[1:05:17] of this engine.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; So I know how it works.
[1:05:21] Can we give God a hand of appreciation?
[1:05:26] Sometimes
[1:05:27] when something is not working,
[1:05:30] take it back
[1:05:33] to the one who conceived it
[1:05:36] because he know why he made it.
[1:05:40] and how he made it. That's why we have
[1:05:43] this couple here.
[1:05:45] We want the conceiver of marriage
[1:05:49] to address them.
[1:05:52] Amen. That's why my little topic this
[1:05:56] morning
[1:05:58] will be for this cause.
[1:06:04] for this cause.
[1:06:07] If you read the book of Ephesians,
[1:06:11] when Paul touched this matter,
[1:06:15] Ephesians chapter
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; 5
[1:06:18] verse 31,
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; he repeat the same words of Jesus
[1:06:24] and say, "For this cause
[1:06:28] shall a man leave his father
[1:06:32] and mother and shall be joined
[1:06:36] unto his wife, and they too shall be one
[1:06:41] flesh.
[1:06:43] This is a great mystery,
[1:06:46] but I speak concerning Christ and the
[1:06:50] church.
[1:06:53] Amen. Are we together? Now Paul the
[1:06:57] apostle
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; he says when he want to introduce
[1:07:02] marriage
[1:07:04] he say for this cause
[1:07:08] so marriage
[1:07:10] is done
[1:07:12] for a cause
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:07:18] that cause
[1:07:20] God who notice it he made an assessment.
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:28] Are we together? Because in the
[1:07:31] beginning
[1:07:32] when you look at the book of Genesis
[1:07:36] and you will see that's the reason why
[1:07:39] many time
[1:07:42] marriages are collapsing.
[1:07:44] They are failing.
[1:07:48] Somebody asked me a question.
[1:07:50] Pastor, can you just tell us? Why do we
[1:07:54] have so many cases
[1:07:58] of divorces
[1:08:00] and there is there are marriages as well
[1:08:05] that are just seen from the outside
[1:08:09] when we look at the people outside
[1:08:12] they are married but in their hearts
[1:08:16] in their hearts they have been divorced
[1:08:19] for a long time
[1:08:21] they are just visible Mary
[1:08:25] but in reality
[1:08:27] they are no more and the brother the
[1:08:30] people were asking me what is the reason
[1:08:35] when you go to a doctor
[1:08:38] there must be an examination
[1:08:40] and assess the matter and find the cause
[1:08:46] if you don't find the cause that made
[1:08:50] God to establish marriage marriage then
[1:08:53] you will never be able to have a blessed
[1:08:57] and successful marriage.
[1:09:01] The only the reason of of divorces and
[1:09:05] so forth.
[1:09:08] It is just because of a wrong marriage.
[1:09:12] People got married for the wrong reasons
[1:09:16] and a wrong reason cannot sustain you
[1:09:18] for a long time.
[1:09:23] Amen. Do you want us to talk now?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; So today I believe after officiating
[1:09:30] this marriage
[1:09:33] we will reofficiate many marriage
[1:09:37] because you can restart
[1:09:40] with the right cause the right reason
[1:09:44] and you will make your life a blessed
[1:09:45] life.
[1:09:47] How many believe God here?
[1:09:50] Let us solve the matter in very few
[1:09:53] minutes.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Now listen
[1:09:57] when God established marriage
[1:10:01] in the book of the beginning
[1:10:04] Genesis
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; which mean the beginning
[1:10:08] God made and it was the man was alone.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; And God came down he was visiting that
[1:10:17] man all the time.
[1:10:20] He He was there. He was alone. And God
[1:10:25] realized
[1:10:27] he said to himself
[1:10:29] that it's not good
[1:10:32] for the men to be alone
[1:10:34] because he knew himself
[1:10:37] that it was not good for him to be
[1:10:40] alone.
[1:10:43] Are we together? He realized if it is
[1:10:47] not good for me
[1:10:50] to be alone then this man is suffering
[1:10:55] and God had to make a plan. It's not
[1:10:58] like these brothers today. Brother, I'm
[1:11:01] not getting married. I'm fine.
[1:11:04] I know how to cook. I
[1:11:08] I can do this. I'm fine. Brother, you
[1:11:11] are not fine.
[1:11:13] Because when when God says
[1:11:16] it is not good, it is not good.
[1:11:20] You can't make it good.
[1:11:23] So, God already say it's not good.
[1:11:27] [Applause]
[1:11:28] It's already charged. Brother, the
[1:11:30] matter is settled.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; It's not good, brother. You must repent
[1:11:36] and believe God.
[1:11:38] That is not good.
[1:11:41] No, brother. I'm helping my family. I'm
[1:11:44] okay. You know, my my family has worked
[1:11:47] a lot for me. I must also and now
[1:11:50] brother is not good.
[1:11:57] Even for God himself
[1:12:00] it was not good
[1:12:02] himself
[1:12:04] before
[1:12:06] he takes care of his family.
[1:12:10] The Jews he come get married first
[1:12:16] before he goes to his family
[1:12:20] say I must first get married.
[1:12:22] Are we together? Now when God come
[1:12:27] and establish the matter
[1:12:31] and say for this cause,
[1:12:34] I want us to speak for a few minute
[1:12:36] about that cause.
[1:12:41] Now that cause is was not you there.
[1:12:45] The man that was there was Adam.
[1:12:49] So remove yourself in your environment
[1:12:54] and travel back
[1:12:57] and be in the environment of Adam
[1:13:01] then we will understand together.
[1:13:04] Now let me say I will shock some people.
[1:13:10] When Adam
[1:13:13] was in need
[1:13:16] to have a wife,
[1:13:18] he did not know himself.
[1:13:21] But God knew and he say it's not good.
[1:13:26] Okay. Adam was not eating cooked food
[1:13:30] [Music]
[1:13:31] at that time. He was given the fruits
[1:13:37] to eat.
[1:13:38] So what Adam needed
[1:13:42] was not someone who will cook.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Hey people are not saying amen. Can we
[1:13:51] say amen?
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; It's the Bible.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; You move around with the Bible. Now when
[1:14:02] we say it, you don't want to say amen.
[1:14:07] Adam was not cooking.
[1:14:11] He did not he he was not eating the
[1:14:14] cooked food. He was eating the fruit.
[1:14:17] So the need of marriage
[1:14:21] was not because he need somebody to
[1:14:23] cook.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Oh brother, I'm tired of cooking. I need
[1:14:30] a wife.
[1:14:33] That's the problem because when that
[1:14:36] wife will come
[1:14:39] if she cannot cook like your mama
[1:14:42] then you start saying ah I made a
[1:14:44] mistake.
[1:14:45] You see you got married for the wrong
[1:14:48] reason
[1:14:50] because the one who established marriage
[1:14:53] he did not make it to resolve that
[1:14:55] problem.
[1:15:01] Who told you the best cooks in the world
[1:15:03] are women?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; No, they are men who can cook more than
[1:15:08] women.
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; I used to tease my wife. I used to tease
[1:15:20] my wife and when people say, "Hey, your
[1:15:23] food is nice."
[1:15:27] and tell her why you don't tell them I'm
[1:15:29] the one who taught you
[1:15:34] sometime you can be the one
[1:15:38] okay can we move on
[1:15:41] am I talking right it's not me it's not
[1:15:44] me I'm talking about the word because
[1:15:48] you need to resolve these things to
[1:15:50] solve them so that things work well
[1:15:55] now at that time
[1:15:57] Can I move on?
[1:15:59] Adam
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; did not have a wardrop.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible even say he was naked.
[1:16:12] Am I talking right?
[1:16:15] [Laughter]
[1:16:18] So he was not ironing.
[1:16:22] So he was not washing.
[1:16:26] He had nothing,
[1:16:29] just one suit
[1:16:32] forever.
[1:16:34] He was busy moving around.
[1:16:37] So he he did not need somebody to do
[1:16:40] washing.
[1:16:43] But God says
[1:16:45] is not good.
[1:16:48] So the reason of God bringing a wife to
[1:16:50] Adam
[1:16:52] is not because Adam needed washing.
[1:16:57] It's not because Adam was tired of
[1:16:59] washing.
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:02] But it was for a different reason.
[1:17:07] I can list them.
[1:17:09] We will stay here the whole day and we
[1:17:12] will realize that 80% of people got
[1:17:16] married for the wrong reason.
[1:17:19] [Music]
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Let me take another main reason.
[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:17:27] At that time
[1:17:29] when Adam
[1:17:31] had to needed a wife.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together?
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Adam got a commission
[1:17:40] from God
[1:17:43] that he should multiply
[1:17:47] but it was not through sex.
[1:17:54] So Adam
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; was not
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; uh meant
[1:18:00] to multiply
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; by sex.
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:08] So when God
[1:18:11] saw the need of having a wife for Adam,
[1:18:15] it was not even for sex
[1:18:20] because there was no sex involved at
[1:18:22] that time.
[1:18:26] reproduction
[1:18:28] was to come by the word.
[1:18:32] So marriage
[1:18:34] was not to satisfy
[1:18:37] a sexual appetite.
[1:18:43] Hey, I see you. You are you are getting
[1:18:45] heavy. But don't worry, don't worry.
[1:18:49] You will come back.
[1:18:54] That's the reason why
[1:18:56] when people get married for with those
[1:18:58] reason
[1:19:00] they end up on the side of the road
[1:19:05] because they realize that
[1:19:08] afterward
[1:19:10] that they cannot be satisfied
[1:19:13] with all those reasons why they came
[1:19:15] there
[1:19:18] because the marriage
[1:19:21] had Another supernatural
[1:19:24] reason given by God.
[1:19:29] Adam needed a helpmate.
[1:19:37] He needed somebody to help him
[1:19:42] because God had given to him a mission.
[1:19:48] He had a vision to fulfill.
[1:19:51] He had a task.
[1:19:54] He had a place to get to.
[1:19:57] God realized that he cannot get there
[1:20:03] unless I give him somebody
[1:20:06] who will be him.
[1:20:09] Who will be able to carry that burden
[1:20:13] for him?
[1:20:15] Because somebody
[1:20:17] who must help you
[1:20:19] has to be stronger than you.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Because if you are strong
[1:20:28] enough, you don't need help.
[1:20:31] How can I seek help from someone who's
[1:20:34] weak?
[1:20:36] How I need somebody strong?
[1:20:40] If I want to carry this,
[1:20:43] if I want to carry this pullpit,
[1:20:46] I will check someone with muscles,
[1:20:50] I will not catch someone who is small.
[1:20:52] No,
[1:20:55] I rather do it myself because if I get
[1:20:58] someone who's weak, he will make the job
[1:21:02] more difficult.
[1:21:04] I need a man who a person who strong
[1:21:08] and God saw
[1:21:11] God saw that the man is weak without a
[1:21:15] woman.
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:19] Man is vulnerable without a woman.
[1:21:24] It is better I kill the man
[1:21:27] so that a woman come out
[1:21:31] because she is the secret.
[1:21:34] of the creation.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; My my
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; the secret of the creation
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; was the woman.
[1:21:46] She was there
[1:21:48] but she was not visible. And when she
[1:21:51] comes out,
[1:21:53] the story of redemption changes.
[1:21:58] That's what the church is.
[1:22:01] That's why Paul says
[1:22:04] this mystery is great. I speak
[1:22:08] concerning Christ in the church.
[1:22:11] Without you, Christ has got no hands.
[1:22:16] Without you, Christ has got no legs.
[1:22:20] Without you, Christ has got no mouth.
[1:22:24] You are the ground force.
[1:22:29] Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; When there is a battle,
[1:22:34] he needs you to pull the sword
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; and fight the battle with him.
[1:22:41] That's the mystery of marriage.
[1:22:44] [Music]
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That a wife
[1:22:49] come because that I'm coming there
[1:22:52] because actually marriage
[1:22:55] revolves about the woman.
[1:22:58] If we don't understand that will not
[1:23:01] make prosperous men.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So God needed somebody
[1:23:13] who can help this man
[1:23:16] get to his destiny.
[1:23:19] Hallelujah.
[1:23:21] God needed somebody
[1:23:24] who can work around
[1:23:27] Amen. Who can become the perfection?
[1:23:32] Because that man is not perfect
[1:23:36] without the woman. God is not perfect
[1:23:41] without you.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why that day when Adam woke
[1:23:51] up and he saw that woman
[1:23:55] my my my like today.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; When Noah sees Anna
[1:24:03] my my my
[1:24:06] hallelujah.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; It was a different amen.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; This is now Adam speaking.
[1:24:17] Not God speaking. This is now Adam
[1:24:20] speaking. Say God
[1:24:23] this time.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It mean there were other times
[1:24:30] that God brought things to Adam.
[1:24:33] But Adam was just saying okay this good
[1:24:36] you lion and this is you and what I know
[1:24:40] this is a good car. This is a good
[1:24:42] house.
[1:24:44] But this time, God.
[1:24:46] Amen. You have brought something
[1:24:48] different.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know you have brought to me
[1:24:54] things,
[1:24:56] but this time it's something different.
[1:25:02] This time it's born of my bones,
[1:25:07] flesh of my flesh.
[1:25:10] Because God did the first surgery.
[1:25:15] That's why he's the great physician.
[1:25:18] Put an estasis
[1:25:21] in Adam,
[1:25:23] slept, cut there, took out the rib or
[1:25:29] whatever.
[1:25:31] Though we have sometime different
[1:25:33] approaches.
[1:25:35] Amen. But he just took out
[1:25:39] something out of Adam
[1:25:42] and made another person.
[1:25:44] Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Adam had to lift his hands.
[1:25:49] Put his hands up so that they open
[1:25:53] just by the heart to take that lovely
[1:25:57] being.
[1:26:00] And God had to take Jesus
[1:26:04] at the cross and lift his hands so that
[1:26:08] he can open so that they can take out
[1:26:12] you.
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:26:20] Amen. And as you were standing there,
[1:26:23] she was standing there. Adam say yo yo
[1:26:27] yo yo this is bones of my bones
[1:26:32] flesh of my flesh.
[1:26:36] There is something that I want to say
[1:26:38] there.
[1:26:39] Adam
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; was not admiring
[1:26:45] the beauty
[1:26:48] of Eve
[1:26:50] but she he was admiring
[1:26:53] the nature.
[1:26:58] cuz her nature
[1:27:01] was his nature.
[1:27:07] And I want to say something.
[1:27:11] The flesh, he say there will be one
[1:27:14] flesh.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:27:20] uh let us not be cannal.
[1:27:26] I think Hana is not the flesh carnally
[1:27:28] of Noah.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; She is the flesh of
[1:27:33] [Laughter]
[1:27:37] [Music]
[1:27:39] Yeah. the the the physical body
[1:27:43] is made of her parents.
[1:27:46] But there is something
[1:27:48] of her
[1:27:50] that has been in
[1:27:57] That's why
[1:27:58] you find her.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; It's because
[1:28:03] she was
[1:28:05] containing
[1:28:07] something
[1:28:09] that you were missing.
[1:28:11] You felt that you were looking for what
[1:28:14] you were missing
[1:28:17] and you find it in her.
[1:28:20] Oh, it mean tomorrow
[1:28:23] there's no way you realize it's not the
[1:28:25] one
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; because the flesh
[1:28:35] is of a short time.
[1:28:38] You look so nice today.
[1:28:41] I want to tell you that when we got
[1:28:44] married, we also looked nice.
[1:28:48] No,
[1:28:50] don't think we were like this.
[1:28:56] Time flies, man. It just look like
[1:29:00] yesterday. But as time goes,
[1:29:03] we start getting tired.
[1:29:06] The hair start missing some of the
[1:29:08] place.
[1:29:10] It start turning gray. The shape is
[1:29:13] changing.
[1:29:14] Brother, I was I was also wearing
[1:29:18] trousers size 3230.
[1:29:24] I was there, brother.
[1:29:26] Don't worry. It will change.
[1:29:30] Time will come.
[1:29:32] Amen.
[1:29:35] Oh my. Are we together?
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; The flesh is of a short time.
[1:29:43] the your wifeh
[1:29:45] she will just change after a few days ah
[1:29:48] don't worry I will see you next year
[1:29:52] it's like Elohim told to Abraham
[1:29:55] I will come this year
[1:30:00] then she will start walking differently
[1:30:03] because because
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:08] when you look at her the shape will
[1:30:10] change
[1:30:12] But you are not getting married to the
[1:30:14] shapes.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; You are not getting married to
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together?
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; But you are bringing together a
[1:30:23] substance
[1:30:26] that will build your destiny together.
[1:30:31] So today
[1:30:34] uh to
[1:30:36] Hana you you you are the vision
[1:30:42] You are the version that your family has
[1:30:45] has made.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Your parents worked, your pastor worked
[1:30:53] and the church worked. Then it you
[1:30:56] became what you are. So
[1:31:03] you are the image of that background.
[1:31:07] You are the vision that background has
[1:31:09] produced.
[1:31:13] But where you are going,
[1:31:15] you will become the version that this
[1:31:19] woman will produce.
[1:31:22] And let me tell you,
[1:31:25] you will become the better version of
[1:31:27] yourself.
[1:31:28] [Music]
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; The same as to Hana what she is today.
[1:31:36] The image of what the parent has done.
[1:31:39] They have worked. They have put
[1:31:42] something. The pastor has worked. The
[1:31:44] parent have worked. And you have become
[1:31:47] what you are.
[1:31:49] Now the father takes her by the hands
[1:31:52] and give her to you.
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:56] It is for her to become the best version
[1:32:00] of herself.
[1:32:05] Are we saying amen to that? Amen. That's
[1:32:08] what marriage has established.
[1:32:12] Like I was saying yesterday there to the
[1:32:14] brother that love
[1:32:17] is not to admire.
[1:32:20] That's not love but love. It's a divine
[1:32:24] nature
[1:32:27] that comes out of you
[1:32:30] that makes you able.
[1:32:33] die for the sake of the other
[1:32:37] because John says there is no other way
[1:32:41] of loving
[1:32:44] than to lay your life
[1:32:48] my my
[1:32:50] am I talking good sense here
[1:32:53] there's no other way of loving than
[1:32:56] taking your life down for the others to
[1:33:00] live so to Love mean
[1:33:04] you don't expect anything
[1:33:08] from the other. You are just loving.
[1:33:14] Hallelujah.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet will say
[1:33:18] when love.
[1:33:20] Hallelujah. When love projects,
[1:33:25] amen, it project then sometime you start
[1:33:30] getting tired.
[1:33:33] Then suffering grace take over.
[1:33:38] It mean you no longer see the mistakes.
[1:33:42] That's how God loves us.
[1:33:45] He does not worry of what we have done,
[1:33:49] of what we will do. He just love us.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; No, this wife I used to love him. I used
[1:34:00] to love her. But the things she has
[1:34:03] done,
[1:34:05] it has taken all the love away from me.
[1:34:10] Ah this man I used to love him but the
[1:34:14] thing he has done has taken all the love
[1:34:17] away from you.
[1:34:19] mean you never loved to begin with
[1:34:23] because love is eternal.
[1:34:28] Oh my. Hallelujah. Can we say amen?
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Can we give God a hand of appreciation?
[1:34:38] Hallelujah.
[1:34:40] Now, as I'm closing
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; just for the sake of time,
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not closing because I'm done.
[1:34:52] Just for the sake of time
[1:34:57] take of eternity.
[1:35:00] The two end
[1:35:02] to bring eternity together
[1:35:05] [Music]
[1:35:06] to make the full cycle.
[1:35:11] Amen.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; As God coming together with the men
[1:35:18] That's why in this evening time,
[1:35:22] God has sent a prophet
[1:35:27] [Applause]
[1:35:29] and
[1:35:31] he closed his ministry
[1:35:35] with a rainbow sign
[1:35:39] under the topic
[1:35:42] of marriage
[1:35:44] and divorce.
[1:35:47] Because he said because marriage
[1:35:52] is a covenant.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; That respect covenants
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; because there are marriages according to
[1:36:03] covenants.
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:08] Marriage was done according to the the
[1:36:11] first covenant between God and man.
[1:36:17] according to the middle covenant between
[1:36:19] God and man,
[1:36:22] which is the covenant of sin.
[1:36:25] And now we have crossed over
[1:36:29] to another covenant
[1:36:32] where marriage
[1:36:34] is no longer a marriage in sin
[1:36:40] [Music]
[1:36:42] but it's a marriage that explain
[1:36:48] the purpose of God
[1:36:53] as Jesus said.
[1:36:55] Have you not heard
[1:36:58] that the one who made them
[1:37:02] in the beginning, he made them one?
[1:37:06] One block,
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; one unit,
[1:37:11] but male and female.
[1:37:14] Amen.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; For what reason?
[1:37:18] so that
[1:37:20] they can return back
[1:37:23] into that city.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; I believe God
[1:37:30] has given a destiny to Noah. God has
[1:37:34] given a destiny to Hannah
[1:37:37] and God knew that they have to come
[1:37:40] together for them to reach that place.
[1:37:45] Today we are going to join them together
[1:37:50] to make this effect
[1:37:54] transfer that blessing to them
[1:37:58] so that they can walk together
[1:38:02] to that city.
[1:38:05] Amen.
[1:38:07] Number one,
[1:38:09] marriage is eternal
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; because it's based on upon love.
[1:38:16] Because love is eternal.
[1:38:20] Amen.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; The cause of marriage
[1:38:24] that was mentioned by God,
[1:38:28] it is
[1:38:30] for a help
[1:38:32] in order to fulfill the mission.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; That's why he say the man is the head.
[1:38:45] the wife is the body.
[1:38:48] So if the w the man is the head, it's
[1:38:52] because the man has a vision.
[1:38:55] He has a mission.
[1:38:57] So if you don't have a vision, you don't
[1:39:01] have a mission. You stop being the head.
[1:39:10] Amen.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. A man must have a vision.
[1:39:16] A man must have a mission.
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:20] You know that as we always say there is
[1:39:23] no bad troops
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:27] but there are bad generals.
[1:39:33] There was you know one of these
[1:39:36] people were talking and he say I I think
[1:39:41] speaking about one of the generals the
[1:39:43] name will come and he say it's better
[1:39:47] I have I have an army of an army of dogs
[1:39:54] led by a lion
[1:39:57] then having an army of lion
[1:40:00] of lions led by a dog.
[1:40:05] That army will never win
[1:40:09] even if they are lions.
[1:40:12] But the leader is a dog
[1:40:17] because the army is waiting for the
[1:40:19] leader to jump,
[1:40:23] but the leader just put his tail back.
[1:40:28] But but the dogs when they see the lion
[1:40:32] leader
[1:40:35] jumping they also play the jump
[1:40:39] they believe that they are also lions.
[1:40:44] Amen.
[1:40:46] Amen.
[1:40:47] Amen. Great leaders
[1:40:51] make great teams.
[1:40:54] Amen. Isn't it? So if you are a great
[1:40:58] husband,
[1:40:59] you will make a great home. You will
[1:41:02] make a great wife.
[1:41:05] Be a man with a vision. Be a man with a
[1:41:09] mission.
[1:41:12] Be the head of your home.
[1:41:15] Have confidence
[1:41:17] that you are the one who will lead this
[1:41:20] home to a good show.
[1:41:23] And God will bless you.
[1:41:26] Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Am I saying the truth? Praise the Lord.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the role of the man. The
[1:41:38] woman being the body.
[1:41:41] If you see a head
[1:41:45] moving around
[1:41:47] without a body, you'll run away.
[1:41:54] You'll say it's a monster.
[1:41:56] It's a ghost.
[1:41:59] It can only make sense when the body is
[1:42:02] there.
[1:42:05] Hallelujah. Because the body
[1:42:08] make the proud of the head.
[1:42:11] The body is able to take what the head
[1:42:15] has
[1:42:18] and manifest it.
[1:42:22] Like the church is able to take what
[1:42:26] Jesus has and manifest it.
[1:42:31] Jesus said, "The works that I do,
[1:42:35] you shall do them and even greater
[1:42:38] works."
[1:42:40] So a man must not be intimidated
[1:42:45] when his wife is achieving greater
[1:42:49] things.
[1:42:51] Actually that how it must be because
[1:42:54] Jesus said greater works
[1:42:58] shall you do.
[1:43:01] [Applause]
[1:43:03] Amen. You must be proud to see your wife
[1:43:09] achieving greater things.
[1:43:13] You need to empower her. You need to
[1:43:16] push her, to move her to fulfill that
[1:43:20] because she is the manifestation
[1:43:23] of the vision in you.
[1:43:26] Hallelujah.
[1:43:28] Amen. Hallelujah. That is submission.
[1:43:33] Submission is not to kneel down. I'm not
[1:43:36] against that. That if you that what it's
[1:43:40] done, it's okay.
[1:43:42] That's not what the word meant.
[1:43:46] When he says submit
[1:43:49] does not mean you kneel down.
[1:43:51] Does not mean if the husband say you
[1:43:53] don't go to church, you don't go to
[1:43:54] church.
[1:43:58] Does not mean if the husband hit you and
[1:44:00] say don't tell the pastor.
[1:44:04] If you tell the pastor,
[1:44:06] you'll marry the pastor.
[1:44:11] And the sister is suffering there. Say,
[1:44:13] "My husband said,
[1:44:16] "Come out. Come out. Come out. You must
[1:44:19] be set free."
[1:44:22] Amen. Are we together? But submission,
[1:44:26] it's a it's a compound word.
[1:44:30] [Music]
[1:44:31] Sub
[1:44:36] okay
[1:44:39] mission
[1:44:43] whatever it is brother they will
[1:44:46] understand
[1:44:52] so it's a submission
[1:44:57] so it mean I am not fulfilling my own
[1:45:00] mission
[1:45:03] I am fulfilling the mission of somebody
[1:45:06] above me.
[1:45:09] [Applause]
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:13] Amen.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I always say to
[1:45:16] sisters, if your husband is a doctor,
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; if your husband is a doctor, you you
[1:45:22] stay there in the kitchen cooking the
[1:45:25] whole time. It's your problem because
[1:45:28] they're in the hospital.
[1:45:30] He needs somebody who has done a
[1:45:34] hospital management.
[1:45:40] Me I will advise you
[1:45:43] to register
[1:45:45] for hospital management courses
[1:45:50] because that woman who is the hospital
[1:45:54] manager
[1:45:57] will become his friend all the time.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; But you you say I'm helping my husband
[1:46:06] with the food but he can go to the
[1:46:08] restaurant but you you are helping with
[1:46:10] the food. The help that he need
[1:46:15] is somebody to pick that thing
[1:46:19] and carry it at a better level.
[1:46:23] That was just in bracket. God bless you.
[1:46:28] Amen.
[1:46:29] [Applause]
[1:46:31] Hallelujah. We'll speak some other
[1:46:34] things some other time.
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:37] Now, we don't want the food to be cold.
[1:46:42] We know they can't wait
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; to be married.
[1:46:47] How many loves the word of God?
[1:46:50] How many appreciate God?
[1:46:53] Let's give God a hand of appreciation.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:03:53] A brother asked me,
[2:03:56] "Pastor, what if somebody lifts his hand
[2:03:58] and say something?"
[2:04:02] I say, "I will tell him,

[2:34:42] come to them, be in between them and the
[2:34:45] world and keep them for you, oh God.
[2:34:48] When we will come and visit them, we
[2:34:50] will see them prospering. We shall
[2:34:53] glorify your name. Oh God, they have
[2:34:56] come this way. Their parents came
[2:34:58] together and bring them to this life.
[2:35:01] Now it is their turn, Lord, to bring
[2:35:03] forth another generation. Make it
[2:35:06] possible unto them. Let them take this
[2:35:09] word, this message, and transfer it to
[2:35:12] their children. Another generation to
[2:35:15] come will look up to them. I bless them
[2:35:18] as your servant in the name of the Lord
[2:35:21] Jesus Christ. I declare them blessed. I
[2:35:24] declare them prospering. I declare them
[2:35:27] satisfied. I declare them joyful in the
[2:35:31] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I rebuke
[2:35:34] every evil plan of the enemy against
[2:35:37] their life and cast that far away from
[2:35:40] them in Jesus name I have prayed.
[2:35:43] believing and trusting in you with your
[2:35:46] love that you will never let them down.
[2:35:48] It is in that mighty and powerful and
[2:35:51] gracious and wonderful name of Jesus
[2:35:54] Christ, our Lord and our Savior, that I
[2:35:56] pray. Amen.
