[42:47] coming
[42:51] right amen okay you may be seated
[42:56] now I reach
[43:01] [Music]
[43:03] let me start again so that I can make it
[43:07] a property the first thing in heaven was
[43:09] a battle
[43:12] as you you have heard from the Bible
[43:16] and Lucifer was kicked out
[43:21] you know that the Angel
[43:24] Michael yeah
[43:27] and come to the Earth
[43:29] then he polluted
[43:38] just like
[43:41] amen
[43:45] then he is being polluting ever since
[43:53] and now from the battle in heaven
[43:57] is coming to the battle on Earth
[44:04] and it is so it is to be finished
[44:11] more
[44:17] at the end time
[44:24] as you seen already that this is the end
[44:26] time
[44:28] [Music]
[44:32] Flats everywhere
[44:35] terrible things
[44:39] because the Lord predicted it
[44:43] shall be like the days
[44:50] that's what is happening right now
[44:54] um
[44:55] and uh he says
[44:58] it will be finished
[45:01] on Earth
[45:03] at the end time
[45:05] at the end time
[45:07] in a battle called Armageddon
[45:10] [Music]
[45:13] now anyone knows that the battle started
[45:17] in heaven
[45:19] [Music]
[45:21] right I mean I will leave it there for
[45:24] now
[45:27] okay
[45:29] we we have this sign here and
[45:36] brother another sign says
[45:40] [Music]
[45:44] and it is dry well it will be
[45:49] it's not running dry I hope it is dry
[45:55] amen amen
[45:57] and then it says
[46:00] it's for the way of the kings of the is
[46:05] [Music]
[46:10] where there was water
[46:13] now it's away
[46:18] how many knows that it has happened
[46:21] [Music]
[46:25] right
[46:27] the river is dry
[46:32] now I read here
[46:37] it says
[46:43] anyway one knows that the battle started
[46:47] in heaven
[46:48] and
[46:50] holy and so they kicked him out and
[46:55] Michael kicked him out
[47:07] and he dropped right down to Eden
[47:13] and then here started the battle here
[47:17] [Music]
[47:20] that's why we are different
[47:26] there's God and the Fallen City
[47:31] because since he is falling
[47:34] he wants to take everybody with him
[47:42] and the people don't understand
[47:48] he can use anybody
[47:51] who is not predestinated
[47:56] because a person that is predestinated
[48:01] amen amen
[48:04] cannot serve Satan
[48:10] but those who are not predestinated
[48:20] the Bible says for you are chosen
[48:26] before the foundation
[48:33] hey before the foundation
[48:40] before he started working on a
[48:43] foundation
[48:45] we make sure that
[48:48] he has made his choice
[48:56] people
[48:58] who will live together with him
[49:06] all right
[49:07] now that's why
[49:10] we are
[49:12] in this blanket
[49:15] flesh yeah
[49:18] and the Bible speaks of the works of
[49:21] Flesh
[49:22] [Music]
[49:27] young people
[49:30] they have lost the direction
[49:34] because of sin in this last days
[49:43] and
[49:44] the church also
[49:48] is being invaded
[49:52] by some spirits
[49:55] now he started in heaven
[50:01] and it is continued
[50:07] until
[50:10] now this is the battle called
[50:13] in the Bible
[50:17] I know we went through this
[50:20] but I'm finishing up something here okay
[50:27] let's continue for a while

[51:51] part of the earth to kill with sword and
[51:54] with hunger and with death and with the
[51:57] beasts of the Earth
[52:00] right that's the pill horse
[52:06] he knows nothing else but just to kill
[52:09] him
[52:16] because he doesn't know where he's going
[52:23] a person who doesn't believe in the Lord
[52:27] he doesn't know where he comes from
[52:33] and where he's going
[52:37] all right now
[52:40] I read now that that is of the pale
[52:44] horse

[1:02:50] but they are called hell
[1:02:59] and those who followed the Lord

[1:03:23] white and clean
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:26] I tell you some of this
[1:03:30] those people
[1:03:32] are still here
[1:03:34] [Music]
[1:03:36] they are here
[1:03:40] and out of his mouth
[1:03:47] that with each
[1:03:49] he should Smite the Nations
[1:03:53] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[1:03:57] iron
[1:03:59] and he said that's the one one place
[1:04:04] of the fearlessness and Wrath of
[1:04:08] almighty God
[1:04:13] [Laughter]
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:18] did you hear it
[1:04:23] now
[1:04:25] we as Christians
[1:04:29] fear him
[1:04:31] for his greatness
[1:04:36] his power
[1:04:39] why especially he came to the earth
[1:04:43] when we were lost
[1:04:48] forfeited the book
[1:04:51] and then he saw which is titled it
[1:04:59] was given to Adam
[1:05:03] because
[1:05:15] now God shared with his son
[1:05:21] gave him a part
[1:05:24] in again
[1:05:27] and planted some trees
[1:05:31] amen amen he did enough for Adam
[1:05:37] okay
[1:05:38] and then after that
[1:05:44] after he was kicked out
[1:05:46] of heaven
[1:05:51] he came
[1:05:53] he saw Adam
[1:05:57] he was full with Envy
[1:06:03] because Adam Adam he thought that Adam
[1:06:07] has taken my place
[1:06:14] he went straight there
[1:06:16] quality
[1:06:20] and said Adam what did God say
[1:06:28] who who spoke
[1:06:32] is that if
[1:06:35] yeah
[1:06:36] what did God say no yeah
[1:06:41] he said
[1:06:43] you know
[1:06:44] she knew the scripture
[1:06:47] he said we can eat here and but not here
[1:06:55] um
[1:06:56] even today yeah
[1:06:58] the people they know that God said don't
[1:07:01] thou shall not steal
[1:07:06] Thou shalt not commit adulterers
[1:07:11] amen but when a man is hardened
[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:19] of course you can only stand against God
[1:07:24] if you are not chosen
[1:07:29] but if you are chosen of God
[1:07:33] that's why he came for you
[1:07:38] to wash you off that sin of Adam
[1:07:46] like saying it was not your fault
[1:07:52] is the first man
[1:07:54] [Music]
[1:07:57] then he took upon himself
[1:08:00] foreign
[1:08:33] that's why you look at the people
[1:08:38] uh
[1:08:41] you know the Bible says love one another
[1:08:46] but you find
[1:08:48] person
[1:08:51] loving only
[1:08:53] his flesh brothers and sisters
[1:08:58] but not another person
[1:09:02] do you call that Christianity no
[1:09:08] a Christian love loves everybody
[1:09:16] that's a Christian
[1:09:24] we still love you
[1:09:28] because that is the love of God
[1:09:33] okay
[1:09:35] now I I will finish it
[1:09:38] now the armies which were in heaven
[1:09:42] followed him upon white roses because
[1:09:46] he's riding white white horse
[1:09:52] foreign
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:18] and Lord of lords
[1:10:26] that still that the king melted
[1:10:32] [Applause]
[1:10:34] when he built Abraham
[1:10:37] he was called melchized
[1:10:42] okay
[1:10:45] I read you yeah
[1:10:48] and I saw
[1:10:52] an angel standing in the sun
[1:10:57] he cried with a loud voice
[1:11:01] [Music]
[1:11:03] saying to all the vowels that fly in the
[1:11:07] midst of Heaven
[1:11:12] and gather and gather yourself together
[1:11:19] yourself together
[1:11:21] and to the supper of the great God
[1:11:28] that you may eat the Flesh of Kings
[1:11:33] the Flesh of captains
[1:11:38] that's the word of God saying this
[1:11:43] and
[1:11:44] it continues
[1:11:47] then he says and I saw the Beast
[1:11:53] all right
[1:11:56] now
[1:11:58] in order to rep it down
[1:12:02] I'm looking at this
[1:12:09] as it says it started
[1:12:13] in heaven
[1:12:15] all right I'm looking at this one here
[1:12:22] yep the weight of God says
[1:12:26] throw their mouth of his prophet
[1:12:31] Satan was cast out of Heaven into the
[1:12:36] Earth
[1:12:38] that's Revelation chapter 12 verse 7 to
[1:12:41] 9. 12 7 tonight
[1:12:44] yeah
[1:12:47] if you serve Satan we are saving a
[1:12:51] fallen angel
[1:12:53] um
[1:13:00] you will also remain in a fallen state
[1:13:08] it depends on
[1:13:10] whom do you send
[1:13:15] if you substituted he will use you
[1:13:23] like
[1:13:27] you know Satan
[1:13:30] in the Bible the time of job
[1:13:34] when the sons of God would come to God
[1:13:38] the Bible says Satan also
[1:13:42] came with them
[1:13:54] until God said
[1:13:57] now what about
[1:14:02] you then
[1:14:04] says I've I've been going down up and
[1:14:07] down
[1:14:10] all right
[1:14:13] when we come to the service what he
[1:14:16] comes
[1:14:21] there is a woman
[1:14:27] um
[1:14:40] we used to talk when I was I will take
[1:14:44] things foreign
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:54] our pasta says
[1:14:59] one day
[1:15:02] he had a dream
[1:15:04] chairman and again and sing Satan right
[1:15:09] in the church
[1:15:12] hey
[1:15:14] yeah
[1:15:15] until then and so forth yeah
[1:15:26] the pastor says
[1:15:29] until one day he approached him
[1:15:33] and he said what about you
[1:15:39] what puts you here
[1:15:46] life come true
[1:15:49] [Music]
[1:15:55] they're also inside
[1:15:57] Linda
[1:16:02] okay okay
[1:16:06] I also have my time to say piano
[1:16:13] thank God he says it's like that
[1:16:16] yes yes it is just like that
[1:16:21] when the sons of God come together
[1:16:24] he also comes what
[1:16:29] with his place
[1:16:33] for Destruction
[1:16:37] he's a man on the Run
[1:16:40] he has failed in life
[1:16:43] now he wants to take everybody with him
[1:16:48] but the people don't know they follow
[1:16:51] him they worship him they don't know
[1:16:55] that that man knows his demise
[1:17:01] he doesn't want to go
[1:17:04] alone
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:18] they say that's how he thinks he can
[1:17:22] disappoint God
[1:17:26] that's why you see the people today
[1:17:30] many people
[1:17:32] they have sold their souls
[1:17:38] the souls are inside in sales
[1:17:43] [Music]
[1:17:44] selling it to Satan
[1:17:48] the people who do not know God
[1:17:50] only a person who doesn't know God
[1:17:55] can sell his soul
[1:18:02] and the ones you sell your soul
[1:18:05] that's the end of you hello
[1:18:11] what a terrible thing
[1:18:16] you know I have noticed that the people
[1:18:19] don't know what is hell
[1:18:25] they could know
[1:18:28] what the hell is like
[1:18:32] but now the Bible says Satan has blinded
[1:18:37] them
[1:18:39] as long as he's alive
[1:18:42] he doesn't care about God
[1:18:49] but yet
[1:18:50] we come and go
[1:18:55] I mean you know
[1:18:59] there's a cemetery there
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:03] is a scrap yard today
[1:19:09] indicating to you that Elijah nothing is
[1:19:13] forever
[1:19:18] both the driver and his car yeah
[1:19:28] there's no car that has eternal life
[1:19:33] it's only men
[1:19:37] because God
[1:19:39] 's Mercy
[1:19:42] brought you out
[1:19:45] amen
[1:19:47] by his blood
[1:19:50] did you know that the kids man
[1:19:54] maybe let's understand it today
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:19:58] he speaks of the king's menopause
[1:20:05] right amen and
[1:20:08] you know I think we were in Tanzania
[1:20:15] where's that brother
[1:20:19] all right
[1:20:25] do you know that Christ is a family man
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:36] why
[1:20:38] he came to shed his blood
[1:20:42] because that was Redemption for his
[1:20:45] family
[1:20:51] [Applause]
[1:20:52] like sometimes the people
[1:20:55] if somebody is sick
[1:20:58] and he will go and offer maybe an organ
[1:21:05] if they say one of the organs
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:13] because
[1:21:15] she is King to that one
[1:21:19] [Applause]
[1:21:20] now God the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:24] that's why God by his wisdom
[1:21:28] and love
[1:21:31] he
[1:21:36] also took the same
[1:21:40] the body of Flesh so for him to wash us
[1:21:44] off
[1:21:46] that is in the flesh amen

[1:26:37] saying to all the fowls that fly in the
[1:26:41] midst of Heaven
[1:26:45] Come and gather

[1:27:25] scripture
[1:27:30] false of
[1:27:33] heaven will be someone to come
[1:27:38] they're fowls
[1:27:44] for a feast foreign
[1:28:06] talking about the uh

[1:28:15] he was
[1:28:17] cast out of heaven
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:23] but Revelation 12 if you you come down
[1:28:26] again
[1:28:28] the very same Satan who has cursed out
[1:28:33] now after all it said
[1:28:37] Satan is cast down
[1:28:40] mufas
[1:28:44] Out of Heaven
[1:28:46] he was casted down to the Earth

[1:29:14] he also has
[1:29:21] the pilots
[1:29:28] [Music]
[1:29:32] all right
[1:29:36] I won
[1:29:38] I went to Austin Texas
[1:29:48] when we were passing a brother said to
[1:29:52] him
[1:29:55] you know here
[1:29:57] there was a mama
[1:30:03] foreign
[1:30:34] then he says now the people started
[1:30:37] together around here
[1:30:39] [Music]
[1:30:41] she took
[1:30:43] that much
[1:30:48] and some other articles
[1:30:52] and just
[1:30:54] push them undone
[1:30:57] amen and they went away
[1:31:05] Isaiah
[1:31:07] one time saw Satan
[1:31:11] sprawling on the ground
[1:31:15] it and he said
[1:31:29] God because
[1:31:31] if a person hears the word of God
[1:31:36] and he rejects
[1:31:40] that means he thinks he know better than
[1:31:42] God
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:52] he was flooded by such thoughts
[1:31:56] and God
[1:32:03] since that time
[1:32:08] if God starts a church
[1:32:10] he also wants to start a church
[1:32:16] amen
[1:32:19] some of them are from the water
[1:32:25] a church from the water
[1:32:27] foreign
[1:32:44] the Bible says
[1:32:47] the fire that is coming
[1:32:49] you know I fit brother Branham
[1:32:52] expressing this
[1:32:57] that fire that is coming is going to
[1:33:01] bend even the water
[1:33:05] [Applause]
[1:33:07] that's the fire of God
[1:33:11] is going to burn water
[1:33:14] that's why Revelation chapter 21 says
[1:33:19] there was no more see
[1:33:24] [Applause]
[1:33:27] oh yeah
[1:33:31] no more hiding place
[1:33:40] revelation
[1:33:43] saying today
[1:33:48] Inhibitors
[1:33:51] of the Earth
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:02] because Revelation chapter 13.
[1:34:04] tells us that
[1:34:06] [Music]
[1:34:07] he says I saw a beast
[1:34:11] coming out of the city
[1:34:17] so there is
[1:34:20] some in the sea
[1:34:29] have you ever initiated
[1:34:32] [Music]
[1:34:37] who can stand up and say yes
[1:34:42] whoa
[1:34:46] [Applause]
[1:34:51] sorry
[1:34:55] but now you are safety again I'm telling
[1:34:57] you
[1:35:05] hey
[1:35:08] we are no longer a sinner outside
[1:35:12] because the Lord Jesus the blood of
[1:35:17] Jesus Christ
[1:35:25] there's a terrible day that is coming
[1:35:28] very soon
[1:35:31] look at the science now
[1:35:33] the floods all over the world
[1:35:38] sometimes if you wake up in the morning
[1:35:42] and you see the news
[1:35:44] what things that are happening
[1:35:47] then you say Lord I'm so glad
[1:35:51] you have blessed us so much
[1:35:55] amen amen that we haven't yet
[1:35:58] experienced such floods
[1:36:03] why God why it is happening like that
[1:36:10] Abraham said
[1:36:11] what if you find maybe two three
[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:19] I could find them
[1:36:21] then I would not
[1:36:24] destroyed
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:33] can just buy
[1:36:35] it he will not destroy
[1:36:41] because of his children
[1:36:45] is that right
[1:36:48] yes
[1:36:49] it is like that in the Bible
[1:36:54] God can say
[1:36:59] because of one person
[1:37:03] because the soul of men
[1:37:07] [Music]
[1:37:09] is so precious
[1:37:13] before God
[1:37:19] if you could know that when God comes to
[1:37:22] visit
[1:37:23] or when he created you amen amen
[1:37:29] when he created
[1:37:31] he said
[1:37:37] let us make men
[1:37:42] Serena
[1:37:44] image
[1:37:46] so that's why man was made in the image
[1:37:48] of God
[1:37:52] but men decided
[1:37:55] to teach God
[1:37:57] and serve another God
[1:38:14] it's a series
