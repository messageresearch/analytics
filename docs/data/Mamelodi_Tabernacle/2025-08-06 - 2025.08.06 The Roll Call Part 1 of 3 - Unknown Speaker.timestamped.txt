[4:31] Verse
[4:33] 21.
[4:49] And he came to Nazareth where he had
[4:51] been brought up. And as his custom was,
[4:56] he went into the synagogue
[4:58] on the Sabbath day, and stood up to
[5:01] read. And there was delivered unto him
[5:03] the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when
[5:06] he had opened the book, he found the
[5:09] place where it was written, "The spirit
[5:12] of the Lord is upon me, because he hath
[5:15] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[5:17] poor. He hath sent me to heal the
[5:21] brokenhearted,
[5:22] to preach deliverance to the captives,
[5:25] and recovering of sight to the blind, to
[5:28] set a liberty them that are bruised, to
[5:32] preach the acceptable year of the Lord."
[5:35] And he closed the book, and he gave it
[5:38] again to the minister, and sat down. And
[5:42] the eyes of all them that were in the
[5:44] synagogue were fastened on him. And he
[5:48] began to say unto them, "This day is
[5:51] this scripture fulfilled in your in your
[5:54] ears." You may be seated blessire
[6:02] [Music]
[6:20] to hear from his mouth.
[6:26] The one who said, "Let there be."
[6:30] He's the one who said, "Let there be."
[6:34] Amen. Amen.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; And it was so.
[6:38] So tonight,
[6:42] [Music]
[6:44] he can say a word.
[6:47] His word is creative.
[6:51] Amen. Amen. So now for
[6:56] subject
[7:00] the subject
[7:04] we want just to bring this thought
[7:08] the role.
[7:11] [Music]
[7:14] Amen.
[7:16] You know in the olden days
[7:20] they used to have a scroll.
[7:27] Amen. So this is what he stood to read
[7:29] that day.
[7:36] Now that's why they call it the call.
[7:42] Amen. Amen. So how God spread the
[7:47] universe
[7:52] and everybody out there
[7:58] just how he did with human beings
[8:00] through the ages.
[8:06] And
[8:08] in each age
[8:11] there's a prophecy. Amen.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; On the day of Pentecost,
[8:22] how Peter stood up and said,
[8:26] "This people are not drunk with wine.
[8:31] It's a prophecy
[8:35] now being fulfilled
[8:39] prophesied.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So it was a fulfillment of a
[8:46] prophecy.
[8:50] So that's how God deals with human
[8:52] beings.
[9:00] When the Messiah was born,
[9:03] it was a fulfillment of prophecy.
[9:08] When we were born,
[9:11] it was the fulfillment of
[9:17] our meeting here tonight.
[9:25] as we should look at ourselves as a
[9:28] prophetic class
[9:34] and
[9:36] since Monday
[9:41] we've been going through
[9:44] uh the beginning
[9:48] the Lord Jesus Christ
[9:51] he compels us to go back to the
[9:53] beginning.
[9:56] Amen. That's why we read the scripture.
[10:01] He said to the disciples,
[10:04] it was not so.
[10:09] So the picture is back there.
[10:13] In the beginning was the way
[10:18] and the word was made flesh
[10:21] and dwelt among us.
[10:24] Now let's look at the the role call
[10:29] &gt;&gt; how God said
[10:32] let us
[10:34] men in our image
[10:39] &gt;&gt; he didn't say plural
[10:42] he said
[10:45] &gt;&gt; amen
[10:49] he said Amen.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; Let us
[10:57] plural.
[10:59] Amen.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; And people are asking themselves,
[11:04] &gt;&gt; who are these people?
[11:08] Hallelujah.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; But down the line,
[11:16] we see the outlets of God.
[11:22] people spoke to
[11:28] a meeting.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; And now this letter was in another
[11:35] dimension.
[11:40] And then after that
[11:42] &gt;&gt; we see him
[11:44] &gt;&gt; coming down
[11:46] &gt;&gt; and to make men
[11:50] out of the dust.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; But remember man is a spirit
[12:00] and God made a tabernacle for each and
[12:04] every life.
[12:10] and he had put in that tabernacle.
[12:15] Amen.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says
[12:21] after he molded that statue
[12:27] then he breathe into it
[12:30] breath of life. Amen.
[12:33] statue started to
[12:36] vibrate
[12:39] and
[12:42] he became a living soul.
[12:46] Amen.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; So God brought one man.
[12:54] This is a special planet the earth.
[13:00] As God is a spirit.
[13:03] But God wanted to fellowship.
[13:07] So he had attributes in himself.
[13:12] So he couldn't fellowship with the
[13:14] attributes.
[13:18] So he was supposed
[13:21] to bring them into indiv.
[13:32] So I will take that scripture again
[13:37] and now uh because after I said let us
[13:44] uh you look for the people he was
[13:45] talking with
[13:49] you
[13:56] these things were proposed
[14:03] [Music]
[14:08] So let us this was in himself.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Just as all things were the Bible says
[14:20] &gt;&gt; all things
[14:23] were
[14:25] let me put it this way. All things
[14:30] &gt;&gt; consist.
[14:34] [Music]
[14:36] So uh here while while reading here let
[14:41] me read Ephesians chapter one
[14:46] Ephesians chapter one
[14:48] &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter one
[14:50] &gt;&gt; chapter one
[14:51] &gt;&gt; says
[14:53] verse 9
[14:55] verse 9
[14:58] &gt;&gt; he made known unto us the mystery of his
[15:01] will according to his good pleasure
[15:03] &gt;&gt; which he has proposed post where
[15:08] &gt;&gt; in himself.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; And that in the dispensation of the
[15:16] fullness of the times he might gather
[15:18] together in one all things in Christ.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Both which are in heaven and which are
[15:25] upon earth even in him.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; So these things were proposed in him.
[15:35] Now I read again first John epis first
[15:38] epistle of John chapter one
[15:42] &gt;&gt; verse one that which was from the
[15:45] beginning
[15:46] [Music]
[15:49] that's something that started in year
[15:51] 2007
[15:53] year 2007 from the beginning.
[15:59] Now God is eternal.
[16:02] Hallelujah. He has no starting point.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; We sing he he was there all the time.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; He is eternal. Hallelujah.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; And then he indicated that
[16:22] &gt;&gt; when
[16:26] the Bible says he had no mother, no
[16:29] father,
[16:44] beginning of days
[16:46] end.
[16:51] Amen.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; That is the priest of your
[16:57] [Music]
[16:59] hallelujah.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; When this shall dissolve,
[17:06] we have another
[17:13] hands.
[17:16] Amen.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; The high priest of those people
[17:27] are
[17:28] &gt;&gt; these people.
[17:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I'll show you that
[17:36] &gt;&gt; you are not a new person.
[17:40] [Music]
[17:41] We read Ephesians
[17:44] 1 vers4
[17:48] &gt;&gt; as he has chosen us.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:53] [Music]
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Because he is the container
[18:01] of all life.
[18:04] All the prophets were in him.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; All the people were in him.
[18:11] Amen.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; So,
[18:14] and uh today we are his outlet.
[18:20] Hallelujah.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Amen.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; That's why now we can reflect back
[18:27] to the beginning
[18:30] as his offspring.
[18:33] Amen.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now it says
[18:39] &gt;&gt; that is epistle of John.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; What did he say?
[18:48] That which you
[18:53] have heard
[18:55] because tonight you hear because you
[18:56] have heard
[19:00] &gt;&gt; but you see because you have seen.
[19:04] Amen. Amen.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; And uh with our eyes
[19:09] &gt;&gt; which we have looked upon
[19:11] our hands have handled the word of God.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Now after that
[19:20] the way he had spread the universe
[19:25] even scientists believe in that big
[19:28] blast.
[19:33] One big blast.
[19:37] And
[19:39] from that one big mess,
[19:45] &gt;&gt; that of energy.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; You know the sun
[19:55] &gt;&gt; contains energy.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And science also believe that
[20:04] there was a a a great blast.
[20:09] That's how the universe started.
[20:12] That's how it was spread out
[20:16] from one source.
[20:19] Amen. Amen.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; So that each and every boy, heavenly boy
[20:26] should contain that
[20:32] contain it.
[20:34] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen from the sun.
[20:39] Now you see life,
[20:42] you see life,
[20:46] they must have light. Amen.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; And uh now let's go to the word to the
[20:57] scripture.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; And he came to Nazareth where he had
[21:00] been brought up.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Now this is the same man the beginning.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[21:14] &gt;&gt; he's the beginning.
[21:19] I won't read now, but say
[21:23] it is the beginning.
[21:26] In the beginning was the word
[21:30] verse 14.
[21:32] The word was made flesh and dwelt among.
[21:38] So the word was in the beginning was the
[21:41] word
[21:44] and now that in the beginning flesh.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; The very same person
[21:53] was
[21:58] &gt;&gt; God unfolded himself
[22:01] to a form a human form.
[22:06] Amen. Hallelujah. You know how Abraham
[22:10] he saw Elohim
[22:14] was the selfexisting one.
[22:17] Now he came to Abraham
[22:20] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says
[22:23] he ate bread.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; And Abraham called him my Lord.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; There were two other ministers with him.
[22:39] Abraham recognized this one.
[22:44] Amen.
[22:46] [Applause]
[22:48] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says
[22:50] after they took their lunch,
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Abraham let them let them out
[22:59] &gt;&gt; and the two
[23:02] went down to
[23:05] the Bible says, "But God remained
[23:12] with
[23:15] Amen.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; And he started
[23:19] to talk with Abraham
[23:22] about the promise
[23:23] &gt;&gt; promise
[23:25] and
[23:29] now he came
[23:32] &gt;&gt; and he went into the synagogue.
[23:36] you know, the Sabbath day
[23:40] &gt;&gt; the Jews
[23:43] would wait for him on the Sabbath day.
[23:49] Even today you go to Jerusalem,
[23:53] the Jews,
[23:55] every time
[23:57] some of them, every time they go to the
[24:00] table,
[24:02] they sit around the table, they will put
[24:05] one glass aside
[24:08] and say, "This one is for El
[24:13] because they are expecting Elijah to
[24:15] come.
[24:18] and expecting the messiah to come.
[24:23] That's why the Bible says
[24:26] the two witnesses
[24:29] they shall go down to
[24:38] dead. Yes.
[24:41] The Lord Jesus said
[24:43] to Peter, John and James,
[24:46] let us go up
[24:50] the mountain.
[24:52] on the seventh day of this of this
[24:56] saying
[24:59] we won't read it today
[25:01] but he went with them up
[25:06] when they reach the top
[25:10] [Music]
[25:17] &gt;&gt; so don't go to their grave
[25:26] [Music]
[25:32] Hallelujah. But your spirit returns to
[25:37] and your spirit waits there
[25:41] until that day
[25:43] when all
[25:46] the sleeping saints shall come forth
[25:52] and the spirit shall be released.
[25:55] Picked up the theophony.
[26:01] Amen. Now not an old boy
[26:06] shall be
[26:08] [Music]
[26:11] was a young man
[26:14] in the first
[26:17] he was a young man in the first covenant
[26:21] naked no shame
[26:25] theible says they were naked
[26:28] no shame that was in the first covenant
[26:34] They were covered
[26:36] &gt;&gt; by the word of God.
[26:39] But after she tasted from the tree
[26:43] fruit
[26:46] started.
[26:49] Okay. Now he came and stood up to read
[26:54] and there was delivered unto him the
[26:56] book of prophet Isaiah.
[27:00] And when he had opened the book,
[27:05] because the book contained
[27:09] the names of the people,
[27:12] &gt;&gt; inheritance
[27:14] and so forth,
[27:16] &gt;&gt; the book
[27:19] amen. That's why the Bible says the
[27:22] books were open,
[27:26] the book of life.
[27:29] We'll come to that. Let's look at this.
[27:33] There and there was delivered unto him.
[27:38] Now we are talking about the beginning.
[27:42] We are talking about
[27:45] this man is the beginning.
[27:49] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; And there he stood among them
[27:55] who know him
[27:57] and and there was delivered unto him the
[28:00] book of the prophet Isaiah.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; And when he had opened the book,
[28:09] he found the place
[28:12] where it was written.
[28:15] Amen.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:17] Now we are going to talk about the wrong
[28:23] where you are called
[28:27] &gt;&gt; and you hear your name being called
[28:34] and you find your place in the
[28:36] scriptures.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; So when he had opened the book
[28:47] He found the place
[28:52] &gt;&gt; as we opened the Bible and found the
[28:54] place
[28:57] that's why we are believers. Amen.
[29:01] We have found
[29:05] each and everyone has a place
[29:08] in the
[29:11] Amen.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; You open you find yourself.
[29:18] [Music]
[29:20] He was talking to me.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; As you know, God always specified
[29:29] like he said, "Behold,
[29:32] I will send unto you."
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Then it comes another one says,
[29:43] &gt;&gt; "I don't believe
[29:45] and so forth.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; I will send unto you.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; So somebody will believe it.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:25] They could not be the
[30:31] recogniz
[30:41] you watch this this thing here.
[30:45] God bless you.
[30:47] Paul says something.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Don't read because I'm still there.
[30:53] But I just want Colosians 1 verse 25
[30:57] says
[30:59] &gt;&gt; I just read 21
[31:01] &gt;&gt; 21
[31:02] &gt;&gt; of which I am made a minister according
[31:04] to the dispensation of God which is
[31:06] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[31:10] of God.
[31:15] [Music]
[31:18] Amen. Amen. given unto me for you
[31:24] to fulfill the word of God.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; To fulfill.
[31:37] Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; What what what this fulfillment means to
[31:41] God.
[31:44] When God looks at you,
[31:48] [Music]
[31:49] he sees his own image.
[31:53] [Music]
[31:56] &gt;&gt; When his will is fulfilled,
[32:00] the image of God.
[32:07] Let us make men in our image.
[32:11] An image.
[32:13] Let me uh go back to this again.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; If you look in the mirror,
[32:22] &gt;&gt; you see yourself.
[32:24] Because if you can see a lion
[32:32] but if it's a lion it will smile because
[32:36] seeing itself
[32:42] now a mirror
[32:44] in the mirror
[32:46] you see yourself
[32:49] and if like the people you know
[32:53] if you and look through the uh keyhole.
[33:00] Maybe in the morning you find somebody
[33:03] looking in the mirror
[33:06] this way, walking that way
[33:09] because
[33:11] he wants to see him or herself.
[33:16] When God said, "Let us make men in our
[33:19] image."
[33:22] Now your image,
[33:24] you look in the mirror,
[33:27] you see yourself.
[33:29] If you see the image smiling,
[33:33] you are smiling.
[33:35] [Music]
[33:37] If you see an image dancing,
[33:45] so God wanted it to be like that.
[33:49] That's why he said you shall do.
[33:54] He said
[33:55] &gt;&gt; you can say to this mountain.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Move and it will move
[34:04] &gt;&gt; and that will be God doing it through.
[34:12] [Music]
[34:16] It was God and his son Adam.
[34:21] Then the Bible tells me that God after
[34:25] creating things
[34:27] he brought them before Adam
[34:30] [Music]
[34:36] says whatever Adam named
[34:47] So that was his image.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Now if you see yourself
[34:54] telling, if you see that man in the
[34:56] mirror
[34:59] walking
[35:00] under a drunken stuper,
[35:09] &gt;&gt; if you see him telling lies,
[35:12] you are telling lies.
[35:15] If you see him smoking,
[35:18] you can't
[35:21] no
[35:26] &gt;&gt; I understand there was somebody
[35:29] two ladies
[35:32] and they had stolen from a shop.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; You know how they do it
[35:39] women.
[35:42] Oh, the camera was there.
[35:45] They didn't know. So then they left the
[35:48] shop.
[35:51] Then the security followed them
[35:56] &gt;&gt; back into the shop.
[35:59] Arrested, you have stolen what?
[36:04] So they went to court
[36:06] &gt;&gt; and they denied
[36:10] &gt;&gt; once said on that particular day I was
[36:13] sick.
[36:16] You know how the people can
[36:18] tell.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:31] The other one says I was in that day.
[36:36] Then they said okay. Okay.
[36:40] One lady had this camera the film
[36:46] said all right let's see.
[36:49] Amen. Amen.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; So they run the film.
[36:54] The next day these two ladies were
[36:55] looking at it
[36:58] and the one said
[37:06] after playing it
[37:09] lawyer was puzzled
[37:12] again
[37:13] after they said that's
[37:20] your image.
[37:23] That's why now God
[37:26] after his plan was man in Eden.
[37:33] He started another plan
[37:36] because he couldn't stand it
[37:41] because man in his
[37:45] mirror
[37:48] &gt;&gt; in his image.
[37:50] Amen. Amen.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; So he started a a a plan of restoration
[38:00] to bring that man back again.
[38:03] so that the fellowship can start again.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; That's why this evening
[38:12] a sinner out there
[38:15] can see God,
[38:16] &gt;&gt; they see you.
[38:19] Hallelujah.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Now, you don't go out and preach to the
[38:24] people unless you reflect God.
[38:28] [Music]
[38:38] Amen.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; That's why God said let us make him in
[38:44] our image
[38:48] and when the Lord Jesus was on earth he
[38:50] said
[38:53] so shine
[38:56] and he said you are the light of the
[38:58] world. Imagine
[39:00] [Music]
[39:02] how should the light conduct itself.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Didn't the Lord said you are the light?
[39:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he is the light of the
[39:13] world
[39:15] and he said you are the light of the
[39:17] world.
[39:20] Now you can read between lines.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Let us make many in our image.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Then he comes again.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; I am the light of the world.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; You are the light of the world.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; So that means
[39:41] &gt;&gt; you are a reflector
[39:44] [Music]
[39:45] of the main light.
[39:48] So people through you
[39:51] can look and see God
[39:55] and they can see the good works of the
[39:57] father.
[40:00] But you are the window to that.
[40:05] Amen. Oh, let's go back
[40:08] or let's proceed.
[40:12] And he found the place where it was
[40:16] written.
[40:18] [Music]
[40:19] Are you with us?
[40:21] [Music]
[40:23] &gt;&gt; He found He found
[40:26] &gt;&gt; the place
[40:28] where it was written, "The spirit of the
[40:30] Lord is upon me."
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says
[40:38] &gt;&gt; after this
[40:41] he closed the book.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that part
[40:48] to them
[40:50] was closed
[40:54] &gt;&gt; and to him it was fulfilled.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; So he opened and read about himself.
[41:06] The spirit of the Lord is upon me.
[41:10] Amen. Hallelujah. Then after that the
[41:13] Bible says
[41:15] &gt;&gt; and the eyes of all of them were in who
[41:18] were in the synagogue were fastened on
[41:21] him.
[41:26] Why
[41:28] is this man trying to tell us that he is
[41:31] the fulfillment of this?
[41:36] Amen.
[41:40] Then the
[41:42] he began to say unto them,
[41:44] "This day, this day is the scripture
[41:48] fulfilled in your
[41:56] he never said in your heart."
[41:58] [Music]
[42:01] Amen. And you know
[42:09] &gt;&gt; because to a Christian
[42:11] fulfillment is in the heart.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; But to them he said
[42:19] your ears.
[42:22] Amen.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; You can go just as far as hearing me.
[42:32] He said to them,
[42:35] "You can go that far."
[42:40] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we find he the Bible
[42:43] says
[42:44] &gt;&gt; he found the place.
[42:48] If you read John again,
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going to say
[42:55] &gt;&gt; uh maybe
[42:58] by the time we wrap up,
[43:02] &gt;&gt; maybe each and every one of us
[43:06] show us this place.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; I show you John had a record
[43:19] and every believer
[43:22] now has a place.
[43:27] Amen.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Now, John chapter one,
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Johannapter one,
[43:35] &gt;&gt; I read this part.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Verse 24.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Now, Philip was of the city of Andrew
[43:47] and Peter.
[43:52] So
[43:55] unto him,
[43:58] take it onto
[44:01] him.
[44:04] We have found him.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; We have found him.
[44:10] [Music]
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:16] Amen. Uh
[44:19] there's a time when you hear
[44:25] &gt;&gt; about him and there's a time
[44:29] when we should find
[44:36] him.
[44:44] Yes sir. So God is not a rumor.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; He is life.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; He's a person.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; That's why people come short.
[45:07] They believe
[45:09] come short.
[45:13] Amen. We end up with miracles and
[45:16] wonders.
[45:21] But finding him
[45:26] because in the beginning
[45:31] in the beginning was the way
[45:35] [Music]
[45:49] Heat. Heat.
[45:51] [Music]
