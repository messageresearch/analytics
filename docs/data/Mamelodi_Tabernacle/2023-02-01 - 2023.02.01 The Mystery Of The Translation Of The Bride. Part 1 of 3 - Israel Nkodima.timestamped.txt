[1:30] that came
[1:31] from Pastor David for this sermon
[1:42] I'm also a listener
[1:46] [Music]
[1:50] so you know sometimes if somebody God
[1:53] put something in a brother
[1:58] and then he says let's talk about this
[2:03] you also become a student to that
[2:08] amen amen and it helps you not to see it
[2:14] more in a deeper way because
[2:20] it is actually the time when you look
[2:26] and what do you see when you look and
[2:36] you know
[2:37] brother Brennan says
[2:40] okay you can be looking seeing things
[2:44] but there's a time when you really look
[2:48] um
[2:52] you realize
[2:55] that this thing is
[2:59] this is what has happened to me
[3:06] the word of God is not just like reading
[3:11] but it's deeper than just radius
[3:17] foreign
[3:36] we spoke about it last time
[3:39] I want to say something that we are
[3:42] going to look at right now
[3:47] because here if we we read because last
[3:51] time we spoke
[3:53] about we read this party
[3:56] and I just to remind you you listen to
[3:59] it
[4:00] is
[4:04] now here uh I read the book of
[4:08] Revelation
[4:10] but I'm going to read uh from
[4:15] the chapters 22 go chapter 22
[4:19] and
[4:23] look at it from verse
[4:27] 6.6 and he said unto me these words are
[4:30] faithful and true and the Lord God of
[4:33] the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show
[4:36] unto his servants things which must
[4:39] shortly be done behold I come quickly
[4:42] blessed is he that keepeth the words of
[4:46] the prophecy of this book amen amen amen
[4:50] so
[4:51] now let us pray for the reading of the
[4:54] word
[4:56] most holy God we
[4:59] just come again this morning to say
[5:01] Thank You Lord amen ah it's so wonderful
[5:06] to be where we are supposed to be this
[5:09] morning amen that's in the presence of
[5:11] the Lord Jesus Christ and father so it
[5:15] let to have your servants Among Us amen
[5:18] and your children
[5:20] those of the stock of Abraham father
[5:23] they call come the
[5:26] long way
[5:27] because we were in Abraham when he saw
[5:33] Melchizedek he also met melchized and we
[5:37] believe this morning Father we are here
[5:40] as the Seed of Abraham that the God
[5:44] would hide nothing from them as we
[5:47] believe father you are here ready to
[5:49] preach to us amen and the word that came
[5:52] to Abraham and came through our Father
[5:55] Abraham
[5:57] to this end time when our the prophet of
[6:01] the hour she cried out and said who is
[6:04] this melchized amen and we believe
[6:07] father we are back in those days
[6:10] with Abraham the man visited by God Amen
[6:15] and brother Branham says the third pool
[6:17] was in the house of Abraham amen and we
[6:20] believe this is the house of Abrahams
[6:23] that we have found ourselves now in the
[6:26] house of Abraham at the end time and the
[6:30] prophet stood in the house of Abraham
[6:32] and said as it was so it is today as
[6:37] Melchizedek appeared to Abraham
[6:40] will appear to us amen so as Elohim was
[6:44] in the house of Abraham Ibrahim is in
[6:47] the house of Abraham with us at the end
[6:49] of time a great visitation of God
[6:52] hallelujah coming to his people and say
[6:55] I am the one who died
[6:58] and much more alive and have the keys of
[7:01] Hades and of death they shall no more be
[7:05] death or Hades because he died to give
[7:10] us life and father we are more than
[7:13] death can be and we thank you as you as
[7:17] we ask you to bless the word this
[7:19] morning in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[7:22] God bless you as we take our seats
[7:27] amen amen and we will go back to our
[7:31] scripture Hebrews
[7:36] um
[7:38] uh going to the subject
[7:43] the mystery
[7:45] of the translation of the pride of
[7:48] Christ
[7:52] amen amen it really suits this time
[7:58] and the Believers
[8:00] Liberty he has set aside throughout the
[8:04] ages
[8:07] until this time
[8:09] amen amen let's turn to the book of
[8:13] Hebrews
[8:14] will start reading
[8:18] from the book of Hebrews
[8:22] two scriptures
[8:25] chapter 18 Hebrews
[8:29] Genesis 18. Genesis let's start with
[8:32] Genesis amen amen God bless you amen
[8:36] Hebrews is matching my mind
[8:40] let's start with Genesis
[8:42] chapter 18 verse 9 to 14. from verse 9
[8:47] to 14. amen amen
[8:51] chapter 18 Genesis chapter 18 verse 9 to
[8:54] 14. verse 9 of verse 14.
[8:58] come here
[9:04] and they said unto him where
[9:09] is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in
[9:14] the tent
[9:15] and he said I will settle in our
[9:17] certainty return unto thee according to
[9:21] the time of life
[9:22] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[9:26] and Sarah hated
[9:28] in the tent door which was behind him
[9:32] now Abraham and Sarah were old and
[9:35] well-stricken in age and it seems to be
[9:38] with Sarah after the manner of women
[9:42] therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[9:45] saying after I'm works out shall I have
[9:49] pleasure my Lord being also old and the
[9:54] Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did
[9:57] Sarah laugh saying shall I of a surely
[10:01] be a child which I am owed is anything
[10:05] to hurt for the Lord and the time
[10:08] appointed I will return unto thee
[10:11] according to the time of life and Sarah
[10:14] shall have a son amen amen okay God
[10:19] bless you tell also to uh chapter 21
[10:23] verse 1 to 2.
[10:26] chapter 21 verse one to two and the
[10:29] Lord's visited Sarah as he had said and
[10:32] the Lord did unto Sarah as he has spoken
[10:36] for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a
[10:40] son in his own age at a set time of
[10:44] which God has spoken to him amen you may
[10:49] be seated God bless you okay
[10:54] don't you have mics for these brothers
[10:56] here calendar Mike foreign
[11:21] we are here brothers and sisters so glad
[11:24] to meet in this place only
[11:29] and we believe that God is gonna bless
[11:33] us
[11:38] mainly that I am part of you
[11:44] this ministers here are my equals
[11:50] foreign
[11:57] but we are just one believing the same
[12:00] thing
[12:03] and we believe God who spoke to us
[12:05] through the seventh messenger
[12:10] as we you know we don't have a problem
[12:13] solve the eighth messenger here
[12:18] we only have seven Messengers
[12:24] and should someone speak about the
[12:26] eighth messenger it is his own sermon
[12:29] not ours is
[12:41] a special mood
[12:46] you know
[12:48] I was so my heart was so delighted when
[12:52] I read about God's visitation
[13:00] a place where God would come and visit
[13:07] a man chosen especially by God
[13:13] amen amen to serve God
[13:17] in his house
[13:22] Abraham Abraham chosen of God
[13:26] amen amen and when God left his place
[13:35] for to visit the Earth
[13:40] was
[13:46] before God can leave his place
[13:51] to pay a visit to the Earth
[13:55] he must have amen much
[14:02] the sea a seed
[14:06] a man who would hear him
[14:10] a man would accept him
[14:14] I'm a man who saw him
[14:18] changing from being a hell of light into
[14:21] human body
[14:27] how blessed is such a man
[14:33] [Music]
[14:35] three Halos of life
[14:39] and he recognized
[14:43] when they entered the body
[14:48] I bought he saw it he saw Elohim one
[14:53] Elohim before he stepped into a human
[14:57] body
[15:01] so we need such a Ministry
[15:07] we see each other Ministry that will
[15:09] show us God
[15:12] coming down
[15:14] into a human into a human body
[15:22] when he stepped friend one time is in
[15:27] the air the last human body is
[15:32] [Applause]
[15:36] behold Bona God is with us
[15:41] because we saw him come and removed
[15:45] amen amen he came into human body
[15:52] all right this is what we are looking at
[15:56] firstly then let us start here to
[15:59] Memphis
[16:05] and
[16:07] he came down to Abraham
[16:12] and they were old how about your face
[16:16] at that time
[16:19] because God wants to do things
[16:24] after
[16:26] the end of time
[16:28] [Music]
[16:29] amen amen amen and when he reached the
[16:34] house of Abraham
[16:37] they were older faith
[16:41] foreign
[17:59] foreign
[18:05] [Music]
[18:06] [Applause]
[18:24] [Applause]
[18:50] maybe you want us to go back again
[18:54] let me touch book of
[18:57] this book I love very much amen John
[19:00] chapter six
[19:03] verse 44. no man can come to me
[19:09] [Music]
[19:10] and yet he was talking to the people
[19:13] who thought that they came to him
[19:16] because they were standing before him
[19:19] [Applause]
[19:21] tomorrow men can come to me
[19:26] I'm in I mean because one part is
[19:29] natural
[19:30] and the other part is Supernatural
[19:34] amen come to him is to come to the
[19:38] supernatural yes
[19:47] but could not come to him
[19:52] uh
[19:57] she came
[20:01] from from here innermost
[20:06] [Applause]
[20:08] she came to the innermost
[20:13] amen said
[20:15] come and see
[20:18] a man who told me all things
[20:21] first place
[20:23] amen
[20:26] so people come coming expecting to see a
[20:30] man
[20:33] when they arrived this
[20:41] verse 25 more verse the woman said unto
[20:46] uh pardon me pardon me 29 I I I I want
[20:50] to say okay
[20:52] come see a man she said to the people
[20:56] who told me all these things that ever I
[21:00] did
[21:03] now when they come they have come to see
[21:07] this man
[21:09] outstanding before amen
[21:12] then he continues
[21:15] is not this the Christ uh
[21:20] now that is something deeper now yeah
[21:26] because our man for saying Jesus is
[21:28] Christ you would be stoned
[21:33] because it was more than a man
[21:39] amen firstly
[21:43] he addressed them
[21:45] um
[21:53] so they expected to see a man
[21:57] and to know Lord what's all about the
[22:00] man she wants us to see foreign
[22:20] uh
[22:22] not everybody
[22:25] could say yes he is the Christ
[22:31] because
[22:39] [Music]
[22:45] so that's why the end time message
[22:52] Christ and said are Christ The Mystery
[22:57] of God revealed
[23:00] [Music]
[23:02] it's modern
[23:09] Christ The Mystery of God
[23:14] revealed he can't say Jesus the mystery
[23:17] of God reveals
[23:19] because the people know Jesus
[23:22] even where he was born
[23:26] they can talk about him and preach
[23:50] you can introduce every anybody to Jesus
[23:58] Christ
[24:00] you need to introduce Christ to
[24:03] Ethiopians
[24:05] [Applause]
[24:09] that's why he said
[24:12] after Peter said Thou Art the Christ son
[24:14] of the Living God
[24:19] you hear it
[24:23] son of the Living God
[24:27] amen
[24:28] why
[24:30] why didn't he say thou art Jesus
[24:35] oh I don't have that part here
[24:38] but I can quote it to you
[24:42] it is in my books here now
[24:47] Christ Christ talking about Christ
[24:51] Peter says
[24:59] because brother Ibraham says the son
[25:02] that was with the father who has cry
[25:05] what was the logos
[25:07] [Applause]
[25:09] oh my God so Christ was the son yes
[25:15] yeah there's this party that can lead us
[25:18] to Abram and
[25:20] Abraham
[25:22] I read this party
[25:26] he speaks here page 15 of cod page 15
[25:30] field God gave himself birth to
[25:34] this son which was before there was even
[25:37] an atom is
[25:44] amen
[25:58] and this one was before there was any
[26:01] atoms
[26:04] then yeah
[26:07] he was not human even it was God himself
[26:13] and who took this form called
[26:19] we call it
[26:21] logos
[26:23] logos
[26:25] logos is the theophany
[26:31] Moses saw him motion Moon as he passed
[26:35] by Raffi he saw that part of God
[26:40] and who is melchized that tells you it
[26:44] was that feel funny who is this
[26:48] of God coming this way
[26:54] because he was revealed in our time
[26:59] in his complete station
[27:04] the prophet even saw him and called out
[27:07] and said Jesus
[27:10] [Applause]
[27:12] when Moses saw him he saw only the big
[27:16] part
[27:19] now Moses can see him today
[27:23] he can see the front part
[27:28] when they appeared in theophany foreign
[27:51] stepped into flesh
[27:54] but not melchized
[27:57] it's still the same God
[28:00] at the time when he visited Abraham
[28:05] in order we bring about the promise he
[28:09] has made
[28:12] he he became a man
[29:09] it is another part of God
[29:13] and he appeared a uh before Abraham
[29:21] Abraham was looking for a city
[29:25] now uh before Billy he could enter the
[29:29] city and all of us
[29:31] he met the king first
[29:36] of the city
[29:39] you will you will never go to the New
[29:42] Jerusalem
[29:43] unless you have met the king first
[29:47] because it's a city that has a king
[29:53] I mean I'll read to you again
[30:06] before we can enter
[30:16] in search of the city
[30:19] he thought that it was already here on
[30:22] Earth
[30:24] the prophet of God says
[30:33] [Applause]
[30:37] and the seed was with him
[30:40] we were in him
[30:44] amen amen so we experienced
[30:49] amen amen that's why you find in
[30:51] Revelation
[30:53] Hebrews chapter 11.
[30:57] you see the Seed of Abraham
[31:00] also in migrations
[31:09] personal name came to the literal Sports
[31:18] Jesus said You shall be my Witnesses
[31:23] starting from Jerusalem Jerusalem
[31:28] that's why the Bible says
[31:37] until he said something
[31:41] and after he has spent the time with
[31:44] them
[31:45] the Bible say they said now let us go
[31:49] back
[31:59] talking about the
[32:01] things that has happened
[32:05] and Jesus said to them all foolish to
[32:08] understand
[32:09] Jerusalem
[32:57] amen but let's start here
[33:00] now you see here this visitation
[33:04] [Music]
[33:06] the mood of the visitation of melchized
[33:14] this one oh he hasn't seen this one
[33:21] or stepping into a human form
[33:25] he just saw melchized
[33:33] this one but with Elohim
[33:38] he saw him coming and stepped into human
[33:42] forms
[33:46] [Music]
[33:48] we have both things here at the end time
[33:52] we have him
[33:54] when he stepped into human foreign
[34:04] all right amen because as it was
[34:09] today is not answer to how so shall it
[34:14] becomes is as it was so it is
[34:21] happening now has happened among us
[34:26] all right
[34:56] that's why he was here with us again
[35:01] he ate
[35:04] Dusty Lake sometimes from hunting you
[35:07] know
[35:10] amen he was here with us
[35:19] [Music]
[35:21] now let's carry on
[35:24] now we are going to look at it how were
[35:28] they
[35:33] as we have said yesterday uh
[35:39] for God to run through his seed
[35:43] he has to prepare a channel
[35:49] amen amen and Isaac as the Bible says
[35:53] see the seed shall be called in Isaac
[35:58] God already made a way
[36:02] from Heaven coming down to Abraham
[36:06] Through the Ages
[36:11] the end of Ages
[36:16] the seven Church ages he introduced
[36:21] himself
[36:22] um
[36:33] that's why the Seven Seals shall not be
[36:37] understood by just a mere man
[36:41] because it is beyond time
[36:44] now if you go beyond time
[37:36] [Applause]
[37:49] it is now your your foreign
[38:19] [Applause]
[38:48] [Applause]
[38:50] foreign
[39:05] [Applause]
[39:24] [Music]
[39:27] foreign
[39:31] [Music]
[40:00] this is not just a church member
[40:04] it's a promised
[40:10] I believe you are not just a church
[40:12] member
[40:14] I promised
[40:19] so you look for a promised sound
[40:24] and church is looking for a promised son
[40:31] referring to the coming of the Lord
[40:33] Jesus Christ
[40:38] because right now
[40:40] we are not waiting for the coming of the
[40:43] Lord
[40:45] coming for the Lord in the Rapture I
[40:49] would say
[40:51] because
[40:54] brought him down to the Earth
[40:59] the people are confused
[41:02] because they are going around looking
[41:04] around the Earth
[41:07] but he spoke to the Earth
[42:15] shall come to his Temple
[42:19] foreign
[42:27] [Applause]
[42:48] [Applause]
[43:08] [Applause]
[43:19] amen okay amen
[43:24] okay
[43:26] and he is known only where he is
[43:31] [Applause]
[43:33] did you hear it God is only known
[43:38] in a place where he is
[43:44] all right amen now let's read
[43:50] and
[43:52] they were looking the church is looking
[43:54] for a promised son
[43:58] not any Jesus
[44:01] but they promised one after all
[44:04] coming to the promised Sons
[44:10] the people born of God
[44:15] the promised son the bride is looking
[44:18] for the promised son foreign
[44:34] [Applause]
[44:41] [Applause]
[44:54] amen when he was born
[44:57] the three Majors
[44:59] they picked up a sign
[45:03] I mean
[45:06] could only read about it
[45:09] the Pharisees the prisoners
[45:25] while the others
[45:32] amen
[45:34] so it's two different categories
[45:39] of those that are reading about it
[45:43] and those
[45:45] who have received aside
[45:49] and some were in the field
[45:53] [Music]
[45:56] a choir of angels singing this
[46:01] there was this woman
[46:07] she also received a sign
[46:10] they came to his birthday
[46:23] the birth of Jesus Christ
[46:26] announced to them by God himself
[46:32] did not know about it
[46:36] like the end time Seven Seals
[46:40] by God himself
[46:44] so it won't rule everybody to come there
[46:47] [Applause]
[46:50] you have received it from God
[46:56] and they come back to where he is
[47:01] [Applause]
[47:23] some gifts
[47:33] um foreign
[48:03] party
[48:30] [Applause]
[48:47] and he was not born there yeah
[48:51] speaker
[49:01] [Music]
[49:09] cannot come into a denomination
[49:14] so they went out to reconnected again
[49:24] now they followed again until it came
[49:29] where he was born
[49:33] [Applause]
[49:36] the sign didn't go about ice cream for
[49:39] directions
[49:42] asking whether it is revealed or not
[49:45] revealed
[50:07] we know that a cloud appeared
[50:12] uh
[50:22] uh let me read it do you listen to him
[50:26] you understand
[50:29] some people are still waiting to hear
[50:32] from Brother Brennan Brothers
[50:36] but he has laid the whole thing
