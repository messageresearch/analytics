[26:55] father god is we are praying
[26:57] we know this scattering does not make
[27:00] the heaven the devil happy
[27:03] but we cast him out in the name of our
[27:04] lord jesus christ
[27:07] he doesn't have any opportunity any
[27:09] single one to come here and just help
[27:11] you away
[27:13] father god let him be outside we'll
[27:15] fight him when we are out there when we
[27:17] are here we are waiting from above
[27:20] bless you away heavenly father we know
[27:23] you better
[27:25] you know us very well
[27:27] father god this morning
[27:29] may you instill the words of wisdom
[27:32] within our innermost
[27:34] so that when the man of god is behind
[27:36] the pulpit preaching
[27:38] we may be able to raise up his hand like
[27:40] the moses of the old
[27:42] for when he preached it is our victory

[28:09] those who came this morning really
[28:11] afflicted

[28:37] the parent carrier
[28:38] father god we know you better
[28:41] and we appreciate you so much once upon
[28:44] a time brother brandon was preaching

[29:17] forefather did
[29:19] there is no other better place we can go
[29:23] we are at the right place
[29:25] where your message
[29:26] preaching from our lord jesus christ
[29:28] coming down to our pastor
[29:30] and the minister unto us is still our
[29:33] source
[29:35] we love you so much this morning

[29:40] the song brother branham says he's doing
[29:43] a very good and a very big job indeed

[29:49] if the song does not go away the rhythm
[29:51] of what the person is going to pray
[29:53] today will not be able to hear him
[29:56] so father god we pray for this beginning
