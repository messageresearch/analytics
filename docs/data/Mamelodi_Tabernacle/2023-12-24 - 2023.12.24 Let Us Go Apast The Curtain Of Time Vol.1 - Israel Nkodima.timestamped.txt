[1:30:46] scripture yet
[1:30:50] misunderstood
[1:30:53] it is revealed it is not
[1:30:57] revealed amen amen now brother Bram
[1:31:01] says
[1:31:03] page
[1:31:05] 534
[1:31:09] 54 all the way back from
[1:31:15] Genesis the
[1:31:20] seventh it's spoken
[1:31:24] of from the
[1:31:27] beginning in
[1:31:29] Genesis
[1:31:33] amen did you
[1:31:35] [Music]
[1:31:36] hear there was something this
[1:31:40] morning I I I don't know whether he by
[1:31:43] past
[1:31:45] us
[1:31:47] but brother Bram
[1:31:49] said in that book Hebrew
[1:31:53] something in
[1:31:56] me met
[1:32:00] that
[1:32:02] amen while the people are going to and
[1:32:09] through who is this
[1:32:13] me then the prophet
[1:32:16] says something in
[1:32:20] me because this
[1:32:23] MC has got no father no
[1:32:26] mother now something
[1:32:29] in something without mother without
[1:32:32] [Music]
[1:32:37] father amen all right amen because
[1:32:41] there's something in
[1:32:43] us without
[1:32:46] father
[1:32:49] without something that was not created
[1:32:56] okay but
[1:33:02] was
[1:33:04] then all the way
[1:33:07] back from Genesis this seventh
[1:33:14] seal from
[1:33:18] where amen amen
[1:33:22] now if you go back
[1:33:24] there the prophet
[1:33:27] says we were
[1:33:30] attributes in the
[1:33:32] mind of
[1:33:36] God that's why even
[1:33:41] today there's something in
[1:33:46] us okay amen
[1:33:48] now as you remember last time
[1:33:53] this seventh seal
[1:33:55] here the Bible
[1:33:59] says it was something that was
[1:34:03] preached now it says when he
[1:34:10] opened amen amen amen
[1:34:14] so the
[1:34:19] opening uh let me read this part
[1:34:24] here where it
[1:34:27] says the six
[1:34:30] C has been open to
[1:34:37] us we
[1:34:40] know and when it was
[1:34:44] opened we
[1:34:46] realized it was Moses and
[1:34:50] elij
[1:34:52] amen but we should read it we should
[1:34:58] read
[1:35:00] Moses when the six was
[1:35:04] open not
[1:35:07] preached amen so the seventh
[1:35:11] SE never said when it was preached it
[1:35:15] says when it
[1:35:20] was
[1:35:22] amen but the six was
[1:35:26] Moses and
[1:35:28] Elijah amen do you know
[1:35:32] that part in the
[1:35:35] book amen okay
[1:35:38] amen we looked at it many a
[1:35:44] time even
[1:35:46] now for the tribulation
[1:35:50] period which is coming very very
[1:35:56] soon we look at M
[1:36:02] Transfiguration and we see Moses and
[1:36:06] Elijah
[1:36:08] and my Prophet tells
[1:36:11] me they were in their
[1:36:17] theop because the Lord Jesus Took John
[1:36:27] and John
[1:36:30] John Peter and James
[1:36:34] amen as we have said
[1:36:37] before he met them at the
[1:36:41] sea was it still the same
[1:36:44] people John James James
[1:36:50] and
[1:36:52] then he said follow
[1:36:54] me amen
[1:36:59] amen abusa Edgar remembers
[1:37:04] that they cast their
[1:37:08] Nets and they couldn't catch
[1:37:12] anything and he said to
[1:37:15] them
[1:37:17] cast
[1:37:20] deeper
[1:37:22] amen
[1:37:23] amen and the Nets were
[1:37:29] full until the Nets were turn
[1:37:35] AP go deeper Peter joh
[1:37:39] James and the next thing the Bible says
[1:37:43] he took them up to
[1:37:46] [Music]
[1:37:48] the from down
[1:37:54] deeper go
[1:37:56] deeper go
[1:38:00] higher the Bible says he took them to
[1:38:04] the
[1:38:05] highest
[1:38:09] mountain so
[1:38:12] whatever he as them to
[1:38:17] do was either deeper or
[1:38:20] higher
[1:38:25] amen these three
[1:38:28] Witnesses they came with

[1:50:53] people
[1:50:56] everywhere everywhere you
[1:51:01] went
[1:51:03] saying the
[1:51:06] six is not
[1:51:12] red now before we pick up on this
[1:51:16] thing let me read to you something here
[1:51:22] now it says the
[1:51:27] seventh now here in the
[1:51:32] Masterpiece page
[1:51:34] 10 I have read this many
[1:51:39] times and as God began to work upon the
[1:51:42] creeping
[1:51:45] things the little
[1:51:48] animals
[1:51:51] upon uh the
[1:51:54] Earth then he began to bring it from
[1:51:58] that into something
[1:52:01] else
[1:52:03] higher finally he brought it into the
[1:52:08] larger
[1:52:10] animals such as the
[1:52:12] lion beer then he brought
[1:52:17] it amen amen then he says that was
[1:52:22] complete
[1:52:24] creation God working on a
[1:52:30] pattern but
[1:52:34] finally
[1:52:37] finally came forth upon the
[1:52:41] earth a
[1:52:44] Perfection
[1:52:47] finally and that was a man
[1:52:50] [Music]
[1:52:56] that's why in The Book of
[1:52:58] adoption he
[1:53:00] [Music]
[1:53:01] says
[1:53:03] men what is
[1:53:07] men what will happen to
[1:53:13] men in the
[1:53:15] book Blasphemous
[1:53:17] names he says the sons of God will be
[1:53:26] [Applause]
[1:53:27] God and in that of
[1:53:30] adoption he
[1:53:35] says say
[1:53:38] it he says about you sons of
[1:53:43] God you are a
[1:53:47] God and there was an out
[1:53:50] cry brother says
[1:53:54] God I said
[1:54:02] when God begets
[1:54:06] [Applause]
[1:54:08] God and to put it right God is worship
[1:54:13] by
[1:54:16] [Applause]
[1:54:18] God
[1:54:20] that's why he said let us make men in
[1:54:25] our
[1:54:27] image let
[1:54:29] them
[1:54:35] and
[1:54:37] but in the book Blasphemous names
[1:54:41] Blasphemous nam I
[1:54:43] think page 10
[1:54:46] 11 he says the sons of God
[1:54:51] will
[1:54:52] be
[1:54:54] God you you are a God who is not
[1:55:03] worship you as a Son of
[1:55:06] God the prophet
[1:55:09] said you will be God but not a God that
[1:55:16] [Applause]
[1:55:18] can God is worshiped by the
[1:55:25] Gods in His
[1:55:30] image all right
[1:55:32] amen
[1:55:35] then then the but the gods who worship
[1:55:39] God cannot be
[1:55:44] worshiped brother bam brother shed some
[1:55:48] tears he when he realized that the
[1:55:52] people were saying he is
[1:55:57] [Applause]
[1:55:58] God the tears ran
[1:56:02] down I am not
[1:56:06] God okay
[1:56:09] amen now it
[1:56:13] says then
[1:56:16] God finally they came upon the
[1:56:20] as
[1:56:22] Perfection and that was a
[1:56:28] man then he could see in that
[1:56:33] man in
[1:56:35] that as brother bam says something in
[1:56:40] me met
[1:56:45] that something
[1:56:48] where amen Met
[1:56:52] m because
[1:56:54] meis without father and
[1:56:57] mother only be
[1:57:01] made by something that has no father no
[1:57:06] mother that was the
[1:57:09] soul when brother Bram says something in
[1:57:16] me that
[1:57:22] now
[1:57:23] God now
[1:57:26] Perfection that was a
[1:57:31] man because men in the image of
[1:57:36] God it's a perfect
[1:57:39] thing and
[1:57:41] then God could see in that
[1:57:46] man it looked like him
[1:57:50] [Applause]
[1:57:54] he was not looking at the
[1:57:56] frame he was looking at ins
[1:58:01] Insight that's why we have read this
[1:58:05] morning he says God don't look at
[1:58:10] you he looks at
[1:58:14] Christ so you should be in
[1:58:17] Christ in order to be God
[1:58:21] am
[1:58:24] am right amen so in
[1:58:28] Christ the image of the Living
[1:58:33] God all the
[1:58:35] attributes were in his
[1:58:38] mind before they
[1:58:41] became because he
[1:58:43] says
[1:58:46] as an
[1:58:48] attribute
[1:58:50] you came
[1:58:52] down he
[1:58:57] says we
[1:58:59] [Music]
[1:59:02] bypassed for to be tested here
[1:59:07] on God caused us to to
[1:59:14] bypass to come to the Earth to be tested
[1:59:23] you
[1:59:24] know you that's why you'll see here
[1:59:27] there some tested
[1:59:33] sounds we were
[1:59:36] in
[1:59:40] the
[1:59:42] then we realized
[1:59:45] that there were
[1:59:47] some side
[1:59:50] of the
[1:59:52] oven here stands the oven there's some
[1:59:57] PS on this
[1:59:59] side and on the other
[2:00:03] side
[2:00:05] then prices
[2:00:08] differ ports on this
[2:00:11] side are
[2:00:14] cheaper and on that other site are
[2:00:18] expensive
[2:00:20] then we were
[2:00:22] told that you see this port on this
[2:00:26] side they have failed the
[2:00:30] [Music]
[2:00:32] test but those on the other side they
[2:00:35] have passed through the
[2:00:39] [Music]
[2:00:40] fire because it says everybody who comes
[2:00:44] to
[2:00:46] him is tested
[2:00:50] [Applause]
[2:00:53] now then is all right the P
[2:00:58] of they were
[2:01:02] tested they are with
[2:01:05] cracks and S things like that they have
[2:01:10] failed the
[2:01:14] test that's why someon this site of the
[2:01:18] seventh
[2:01:21] one is on the other
[2:01:24] side things that are
[2:01:27] tested are not in the same
[2:01:31] place with the things that pass the
[2:01:39] test all right amen
[2:01:43] then he could see in that
[2:01:47] man it looked
[2:01:49] like
[2:01:52] him he opened all the
[2:01:55] sales but when he arrived at
[2:02:01] [Applause]
[2:02:05] the
[2:02:08] because that was
[2:02:11] something the
[2:02:14] brothers gave this in two
[2:02:17] books in two
[2:02:22] books where's the other one of
[2:02:26] transformation the
[2:02:29] power do I have it
[2:02:33] here

[2:23:44] man
[2:23:46] Redeemer he says this word that
[2:23:52] Gabriel brought to
[2:23:55] me because he
[2:23:58] says the the word that God
[2:24:02] spoke has never found a
[2:24:05] place until that word found a place in
[2:24:13] Mary the blood that somebody will refuse
[2:24:19] yet it will find a place in some
[2:24:25] good if God
[2:24:28] speaks that word cannot just drop to the
[2:24:32] Ground God will never
[2:24:35] speak a word if there is no place for
[2:24:39] that
[2:24:42] word before his speak there is a brother
[2:24:49] the place for that way there's a sister
[2:24:53] here place for
