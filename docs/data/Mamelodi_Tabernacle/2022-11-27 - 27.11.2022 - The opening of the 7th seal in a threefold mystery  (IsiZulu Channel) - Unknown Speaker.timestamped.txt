[1:23:37] secret party

[1:23:52] see secret past

[1:24:03] the beginning of the end
[1:24:07] foreign
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:39] in this book
[1:24:43] 211
[1:24:46] now look
[1:24:48] in what is
[1:24:51] anything that had a beginning has an
[1:24:54] image
[1:25:00] because God anything that had a
[1:25:03] beginning
[1:25:10] but God was not created
[1:25:13] he was always
[1:25:15] God why he says amen
[1:25:20] have you may take your system
[1:25:25] and
[1:25:28] I don't think you will dispute this um
[1:25:34] your soul was not created
[1:25:37] um
[1:25:48] so that your soul was processed
[1:25:53] um
[1:26:00] your soul was an attribute
[1:26:03] um
[1:26:08] which
[1:26:10] was not a creation
[1:26:13] but he created a body for that Soul
[1:26:18] um
[1:26:27] he became a living
[1:26:31] um
[1:26:43] all right now let's look at this
[1:26:50] they're not willing because standing now
[1:26:53] Manchester anything
[1:26:56] that has a beginning
[1:26:59] yes and in even spiritual amen
[1:27:04] okay
[1:27:06] now that's that's that's why in La cork
[1:27:09] we have shunned the things of the world
[1:27:13] [Music]
[1:27:15] because they begin somewhere
[1:27:18] end up somewhere it is
[1:27:24] the river Euphrates began somewhere um
[1:27:33] okay amen
[1:27:37] if our gospel has a beginning
[1:27:41] um
[1:27:48] all right now we we will read this
[1:27:55] the secret path is

[1:28:46] because no more constellations
[1:28:56] only in there
[1:28:58] in the constellations

[1:30:27] this part we went through it last time
[1:30:38] the only way you'll get the threefold
[1:30:42] revenation
[1:30:49] you only know him when you are in him
[1:30:53] and he is in you
[1:30:55] um
[1:30:59] that's right and
[1:31:02] this is the threefold Revelation is
[1:31:07] we were trying to put it last week

[1:31:29] we look at the other scriptures
[1:31:40] amen amen it's not a contradiction

[1:32:00] the Sun
[1:32:08] but after the church ages

[1:32:17] you see now the difference
[1:32:22] the world don't know
[1:32:25] is the Son of God
[1:32:31] to us now today
[1:32:36] when he came he came as this to as the
[1:32:41] son of men
[1:32:47] his people
[1:33:00] for him
[1:33:02] okay the body dies
[1:33:12] because they couldn't kill us
[1:33:17] just as good as they can kill yourself
[1:33:23] because your body is not yourself

[1:34:24] if you say I know him um
[1:34:27] like Paul says I know him and him
[1:34:31] crucified
[1:34:34] there's only one way to know him
[1:34:40] and the only way today
[1:34:47] you'll get the threefold revelations
[1:34:57] I'm trying to
[1:34:59] pick up something here
[1:35:10] original
[1:35:12] or a three-fold
[1:35:15] mystery or region how it looked like

[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:31] who has
[1:40:33] some roots
[1:40:37] you can trace it back
[1:40:42] we have tried to read those things
[1:40:48] about what it was
[1:40:53] you can see what it is
[1:41:00] because we have seen it from what it was
[1:41:09] foreign
[1:41:17] [Music]
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:38] the first man in the lower creations of
[1:41:42] God
[1:41:43] foreign
[1:42:14] then out of God came the logos
[1:42:20] which was the son of God
[1:42:23] then out are you listening out of this
[1:42:26] out of this
[1:42:30] nowhere else
[1:42:38] because like threefold Revelations
[1:42:42] of a man
[1:42:45] to normal
[1:42:57] you know that's why the Bible says Lord
[1:43:01] Jesus
[1:43:05] when
[1:43:07] the people would come and
[1:43:10] know would not know him
[1:43:14] no one can come to me
[1:43:19] my father who has sent to me
[1:43:27] amen amen amen no one can come
[1:43:39] you can't come to him
[1:43:44] foreign
[1:44:38] anas
[1:44:50] and where I am
[1:44:53] because you don't belong to the
[1:44:56] threefolds
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:21] foreign foreign
[1:45:52] I'm going to John chapter 6 8 is it yeah
[1:46:02] eight
[1:46:04] you know I I'm
[1:46:07] that is it John chapter six
[1:46:14] Forty Four
[1:46:16] yeah yeah yeah you're right brother
[1:46:18] you're right
[1:46:20] now it says verse 44 80.
[1:46:27] we can rather go further
[1:46:33] okay
[1:46:36] you know you know you know you're not
[1:46:38] the scripture
[1:46:40] amen amen
[1:46:42] it should be John
[1:46:45] where he says
[1:46:48] I am the bread
[1:46:54] from from Heaven okay
[1:46:58] I want to pick it up where he started
[1:47:06] verse 35
[1:47:07] foreign
[1:47:21] yes okay
[1:47:25] you know some of the letters here
[1:47:28] because of the yes
[1:47:32] and scratching and scratching
[1:47:41] spiritually palatable
[1:47:43] and start preaching
[1:47:52] that is first
[1:47:56] hey hey
[1:47:58] 44 you are right 44. hey verse 44. no
[1:48:02] man can come to me
[1:48:06] except the father who has sent me
[1:48:10] um
[1:48:12] you know their father I am meaning I am
[1:48:17] part of the three
[1:48:19] foods
[1:48:21] you are also part of the threefolds now
[1:48:26] you want you you want to know me
[1:48:31] unless the father
[1:48:35] who is the the headships
[1:48:44] foreign
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:49:22] because we were in this
[1:49:26] three-fold Robert
[1:49:35] after him came forth out of
[1:49:42] the logos
[1:50:20] of the food
[1:50:26] the father
[1:50:28] because
[1:50:43] that's why Jesus comes and it says
[1:50:54] Jesus said to the disciples
[1:51:06] because if you are part of the
[1:51:09] threefolds
[1:51:14] [Applause]
[1:51:19] don't know a stranger easy Focus he says
[1:51:23] my sheep know my voice
[1:51:27] a stranger
[1:51:29] the Sheep is simple
[1:51:32] cannot be angry
[1:51:38] what am I going to say because
[1:51:43] there was only one voice
[1:51:51] because he said they know my voice
[1:51:57] because falling within there
[1:52:02] threefold
[1:52:09] because they are a part
[1:52:13] you know this body of mine is
[1:52:27] hey I'm so tired tomorrow I'm going I'm
[1:52:30] not going to the service
[1:52:36] the message is sent forth to the entire
[1:52:39] body
[1:52:41] um
[1:52:49] it's from their
[1:52:53] centering the whole body
[1:53:01] now all the organs in the body is
[1:53:11] so tired in the morning
[1:53:14] because of the message
[1:53:46] and the weight was that we are not going
[1:53:48] to use ability
[1:54:02] hey I I wonder you know this morning I
[1:54:05] wonder yes

[1:54:17] word of God
[1:54:19] um
[1:54:36] let me check this old Bible of my again

[2:46:21] next time

[2:46:30] possessed with the spirit
[2:46:34] a part of this Angelic being spirits
[2:46:38] which rotated off of God yeah
[2:46:46] rotated off of God
[2:46:50] that never fell

[2:46:55] and resisted the devil's life amen
[2:47:07] oh my goodness
[2:47:09] if you are a liar um

[2:47:40] were subject to become humans
[2:47:46] foreign
[2:47:58] those Angelic beings
[2:48:03] which rotated off of God
[2:48:06] yeah
[2:48:17] [Music]
[2:48:23] then it will end up in heaven is
[2:48:29] if you have resisted the devil in heaven
[2:48:34] then that the resistance
[2:48:38] if you are taking that resistance with
[2:48:41] you back to heaven
[2:48:46] the battle in heaven
[2:48:49] was you'll come back to occupy
[2:48:55] those who have won the battle in here
[2:48:58] are now fighting their way back to
[2:49:01] Heaven

[2:49:31] and more than two-thirds of the Angels
[2:49:35] were kicked out
[2:49:39] please
[2:49:58] that I don't believe in this Jesus
[2:50:04] not rotated
[2:50:15] them because you won't be there during
[2:50:17] the tribulation
[2:50:22] they will be wearing suits like this

[2:51:17] [Applause]
[2:51:19] teaching preach and preaching
[2:51:27] what's wrong he was defeated in heaven

[2:51:43] they've won the battle in heaven
[2:51:46] even right now
[2:51:49] amen amen amen today they will win
[2:51:56] amen even tomorrow
[2:52:01] um
[2:52:03] it doesn't start here with a long prayer
[2:52:12] those Spirits

[2:53:07] it
[2:53:10] even the sun don't know
[2:53:14] we have read it lasts
[2:53:16] there is no Eternal signship
[2:53:23] it is God himself
[2:53:29] who came as a substitute
[2:53:33] [Music]
[2:53:35] for us a melaton after Adam forfeited
[2:53:40] the books
[2:53:42] that's why you see him with the book
[2:53:45] Revelation chapter five

[2:55:05] they Minister unto us yes those corns
[2:55:10] because the Lord Jesus Took not
[2:55:14] their form of angels
