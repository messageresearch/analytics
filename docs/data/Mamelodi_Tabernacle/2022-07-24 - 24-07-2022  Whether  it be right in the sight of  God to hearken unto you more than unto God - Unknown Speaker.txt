jesus christ in jesus christ's name well you may be seated god bless you let us take this short birthday okay oh i'm reminded that we have opened the scripture in heaven yes sir john chapter 8 verse 22 to 23 then said the jews will he kill himself because he saith whether i go he cannot come and he said unto them do you have acts chapter 4 acts chapter 4 5 to 19. i think can you run that marathon or else and it came to pass on the morrow that they are rulers and elders and scribes and anas and high priests and caiphus and john and alexander and as many as way of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem right are you listening who will gather together [Music] where we have started and it came to pass on the morrow that there are rulers and elders and scribes and anas and the high priest and caiphus and john and alexandra and as many elsewhere of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem okay and when they had said i'll stop you somewhere just not actually stop you but carry on and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have he done this then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders meaning they ask whom peter peter because he has just prayed and somebody was healed and then by what power or by what name have we done this and peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the imported men by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom he crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was set at not of your builders which is become the head of the corner neither is their salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant me they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the cancer they confessed among themselves saying what shall we do this mean for the that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is manifested to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it but that is spread no further among the people let us strictly threatened them that they speak henceforth to no men in this name and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to haken unto you more than unto god judge ye let's say it in the right way whether it is right against his show whether it is right whether it is whether it be right in the sight of god to haken unto you more than unto god judge ye to waken unto you modern unto god you know the scripture yes he said you are from beneath i am from above going through that there is another scripture i'm trying to say there is another scripture 15 verse 9 to 10. mark chapter 15 verse 9 to 10 but palette answered them saying we leave that i release unto you the king of the jews for he knew that the chief priest had delivered him for envy those were elders the priests those who brought jesus for to be crucified he oh [Music] but is you watch all this i will read you something here john from the look jesus [Music] the word of is foreign hey yes foreign in their house an engineer okay remain abandoned okay amen now manju we've got the ministers [Music] ends [Music] [Music] [Music] in order to kill the testimony this is what the people are trying to do even in these churches it depends uh against jesus hey zenzo 13 verse 24 paul speaking and when john had first preached before his coming the coming of the lord the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel and as john fulfilled his course he said who think ye that i am i am not here but be behold there cometh one after me the shoes of the shoes of whose feet i am not worthy to lose men and brethren children of the stock of abraham and whosoever among you feareth god do you to you is the weight of the salvation center amen for they that dwell in jerusalem is referring to the to the priest and they are rulers because they knew him not they knew not whom it is the voices of the prophets the voices they knew not the voices of the prophet prophet amen amen i i i hope you are with me here it is you know the rulers our party the preachers evangelists [Music] he is the religious city of the world like today we are saying that city the message sent to us it's like jerusalem all the children inside now ok but i must let you know guy a man a man a man if you think you will kill children here for money you will never get that man [Applause] from the man let's you know satan is going to bend but still he is so naughty and then god that dwell at jerusalem and they are rulers because they knew him not know yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him they will israel and they and though they found no cause of death in him yet desired the pilot that he should be slain [Music] and when they have fulfilled all that was written of him they took him down from the tree and they laid him in a sepulchre what is my brother will read it to me is that where it says that is ephesians is it chapter four conversely from verse 8. wherefore he said when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto me now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might feel all things um m for christ also have once suffered for sin the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirit in prison right put to death read again to death put to death being put to death in the flesh in the flesh when they came he said to them what google our problem is this party uh
