scriptures here this is all fundamental when we only that maybe i will listen to you because that's not the way i sing it finally we are here we've got some wonderful that song i always even read it at home to me they are preaching to me give me bias some so god bless you now we are going to open our scriptures that will be revelation 22 22. we are going to connect to that scripture the spirit and the bride saying come on amen even if perhaps the world is not saying come but the spirit and the bride is the great i am the one who was there before even there was any sound the one who was there before there was satan the one who was there before there was light because he is the light we want to thank you this morning that we are here again to worship you satan is a defeated foe and even today he is defeated he was defeated he will be defeated and the father the day will come when your children will be marching back home coming through the perigees inside the city there we will dwell with him and the light will be coming from the top of the pyramid father we are so thankful we are here to worship you we know you are coming very soon we pray for the word we are about to partake of that you bless it and bless it in our hearts and keep it in our hearts as we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen ah god bless you god bless you yeah we need to worship god with joy yes let us read that scripture verse 12 and behold i come quickly and my wife is foreign i will start reading from the books i have here [Music] the lord is coming you've made the preachers yes the churches amen but finally the spirit and the bride say come voting i'm also saying come numbing it was amen are you saying the same thing [Music] that is the bride as i am saying now i'm not talking about the message churches the bride of christ the bride of christ [Music] time christ they are [Music] i'm going to read this part to you here [Music] this seventh seal the seventh seal is spoken of from the very beginning in genesis who can again i think i've got them together here it is in this book i think the unveiling of god i should be having one year the unveiling and what in unveiling of page 42 it says page 42 18. um yes it says the seventh seals the seventh seal open up the revelation of islam what that was what is all revealed in there amen amen because the bride should be preaching to what is do you understand that you really can bring the full perfect message we don't have what that was where is that party this is the feast of the trumpets the fist of the trumpet and the seven seals had the mysterious hid [Music] the bride is made of that was i don't know let me repeat it the bride of christ and that is this is what makes the bride of christ [Music] now you listen to the message preached by the bride is different from any other message because it is that words all right okay now i will leave it there the seven seals mystery power is combined of what it was it all was has to bring it's supposed to open in the last day at the end of time because that was before time now if it was before time then it will come to the end after the end of time [Music] like the seventh church age was i i have tried to demand it a time because it says in the book the the rapture is there are things that you hear me repeating time and again just for the sake of repeating it is because it isn't yet found you know jesus said to the the pharisees which is what you didn't find them in those [Music] it finds a place that place was there all the time for israel all right now we keep on repeating things that they couldn't find a place in the people but if there is no place you can repeat it still it won't help what a negative because it has no place you know in the bible you you read everything place contradicts the place of god [Music] because [Music] has got no place in you right maybe we are waiting for light or i don't know somebody stealing the i'll use somebody else's torch okay that's why bible you don't know when the lights will switch off ah amen so fountain when one light switches off [Music] then we have another light then he said okay amen all right now we are i'm through that i think you have had it what is that in these books now i'm going to the book one of the wonderful books see zoya what is this smelly kiss who is this multi-sedec that is another one who is this milky seduc you know [Music] as he came as a son of man i will go back again jesus the prophet said um something in me met that male kiss yesterday i don't know if i should ask one person to come and say what does that mean he doesn't say i meant that sometimes when [Music] [Music] this one is coming to the one who is in abraham you can see with us [Music] now that's why he says something in me that means something in me you should imagine that something in that prophet when he approached i will read it when he approached a when he approached abraham about what um i'll start from because this is for the seed uh but then where is the royal seed of abraham ap of course now not just the seed but there is [Music] but as of one and two seed which is cast right nothing here to thy seed which christ god bless you amen all right so the seed remains christ in christ that's why if you receive christ follow christ you when if you receive christ in the book uh seven church ages it says in what the seven church ages it speaks of the seed meaning the reason you are born again it is because you are a seed [Music] that's why you are born next time you get seed from the very same seed you have planted it and then you plant again so blinded by even [Music] maybe somebody will be able to catch up who's ready oh because you have taken your jacket off i don't see you all right brother 10 to 12. and i heard um [Music] [Music] okay can you worship a god who has a short time whom i'm called if that goddess all is amen if our god actually our god is eternity [Applause] meaning that his children have eternal life now we are going to look into this because there's even a question here but then where is the royal seed of abraham [Music] we of course see abraham i'll tell you how my mind operates we hear of this of this some people saying bad things about some people some people suffer churches caesar [Music] now i don't know of the pieces of the bride okay now it says then where is the royal seat of abraham pointed out that he said as it was in the days of sodom [Music] and when he is manifested in human flesh that means he is in the form of men to shoot you but that is god [Music] how can you as he comes as a man amen and told what sarah was thinking back in a heart then i will take this part here [Music] this male kisadek became jesus now when he when he came as jesus the people who could see him [Music] the ways of eternal life are with you [Music] he has seen melchizedek but the time he saw him he was [Music] when he is introduced as the one without mother with some soul father no beginning of days without father without then he was one time introduced as jesus the savior there was this one yeah still the same man amen we see him at another time that is the same one for something you know a being without father without mother without beginning of days without ending of days [Music] can change itself into many things again right now i read here melchizedek he became jesus christ jesus christ he became jesus christ of christ now i'm looking at something when i read this part here when abraham met him he was melchizedek [Music] we will say what when abraham met him he met him like this here comes a man [Music] it's a man but to abraham but to another person he is a man but to abraham god [Music] their earthly bodies now when they meet they don't look like men meeting another man [Music] that is something else now if the lord jesus or a god [Applause] [Music] uncle if jesus comes and is a man then they say but you are a man when i will move but and acting like god god is is [Music] god god is in heaven you understand what i mean yes this is our waiting thing they were waiting for the messiah rebuilding the messiah messiah came the messiah with him from america because to them he is he's a yeah it's it is a man acting like a god indoor dungeon all these times so they are still waiting for the messiah was no messiah you meet messiah uh from your soul messiah from not just something like this did you know that he was local there was a clever boy at school pneumonia um so jesus comes jesus jesus after the resurrection of lazarus i even got more angry [Music] it there's a record he has just set up another record that a man was dead [Music] and he has resurrected that manga you are the amateur god [Music] and we people are trying to preach the message that has been preached that was preached by the prophets you say this book adoption we are a mature i don't know whether you understand what i'm talking about the prophet says in prophet your inheritance is your sonship everything right who is preaching that quotation did you understand it negotiated right they hated jesus without any cause even if somebody comes and say he says he will destroy the temple in three days or one day just because it is jesus just because but because it is jesus it depends who is saying it who is hatred in the world just like they did with jesus now let's look at this and close when abraham yeah many people have you ever met god somebody else could meet him [Music] [Applause] she says but if it was somebody else [Music] you met jesus he talked to him to hear him if it was somebody else no one should call another one to to say to another one which [Music] the first thing which is gonna and which is gonna do um [Music] foreign you know during our school days but to us it was not the problem was thinking i'm not talking up against the government um let's say the government [Music] [Music] but we are not talking about that then god doesn't care that a good child is a good child [Music] so now you are a good child when abraham met [Music] [Music] was somebody explain that something in abraham because that men age you know if i can if should i say to you this man has got no father no matter no beginning of days you don't expect the person to to take a coffee [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] he has no father again amen but yet what amen now i read when abraham met him yeah [Music] all right he unfolds here what all the attributes will do [Music] he [Music] believers are not attributes he unfolds here abraham abraham unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end uh you will absolutely do the same thing you're going to [Music] attributes the mind of god we will do that because we'll do in the final end meaning at the end you know here it says the spirit and the bread and we read it last time they will say the same thing buy your show now what abraham did here now abraham is passed on to all the attributes [Music] [Music] [Music] as well as you are an attribute [Music] i think i've gone but at the final end god every son of abraham young we see the attribute sons of his spirit is even now because when we live we shall leave this body in another form fiong this body is subject to the word [Music] [Music] yes but while you are here on earth go to salaam shabbat with you funny can be seen men cannot see your family is that right now it's your fault something [Music] why the bible says who man is really he that is born of god because inside of this person is a seed that cannot sin because he is born of god god can give birth to a sinner if you say i'm a child of god what is sin you are looking at some fruits here where is the taylor hatred in zwondo love of mine name them envy jealousy name i went [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] divine no one is trying to stop you from doing something i know it is your nature not to do that [Applause] [Music] amen now it is impossible for me to go back to sin again because nature saying but the bible says by their fruits [Applause] [Music] it only says [Music] is but it takes something divine i mean to control something that is divine [Music] until you end up you can try to we are seeing it looking at somebody who's doing sinister things every time [Music] um [Music] [Music] to hit that dog [Music] as soon as it sees that man it foreign um it would be better if this man could stop drinking [Music] foreign [Music] waiting for the anus to change off the body [Music] right i'm waiting [Music] [Music] the prophet even comes with something prophetic okay now here it says the the end of it is that attributes is [Music] i'm not even saying all the born again i'm talking about his own mind [Music] you think like he thinks because you are an says amen maybe you can't say come because they promised you increase this coming month all right amen that's why they say this world is not my home i go back to london i'm just a passing through me live now how can you love the things of the world while you are passing it now finally let me read you some things yes i i said i was in another country and i was being talking to everybody i said where is the pastor and so little fully see he says no no [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] where is this thing coming from until the spirit and the bride say come on because they know they are talking they are referring to somebody come on um because they are ready to occupy their new homes bangladesh this great fountain of spirits which had no beginning you see the spirit and the bride i don't have my cod here it tells me that jesus was the logos then it carries on to say and out of the logos came forth you came out of the logos now you are from god [Music] you are going back to where you came from [Music] amen you didn't come from satan so you can't go back to satan you know there was what he calls the fountain of life of life with seven colors this great fountain out from it was the son of god it was the only visible form that the spirit had a theophany [Music] out of that fountain of life [Music] [Music] the bible says he has known us not when you were born before the foundation of the world caesar uh don't make you knew [Music] i read logos that went out of from it was the son of god but you see do you know this almighty god that we serve he gave birth to himself and he came as jesus was after giving birth to himself [Music] and they said i am from my father now you can search all eternity to find his father you won't find an old man being his father he will change himself [Music] and when they arrested him it

father in the beginning was the logos you know logos is theophany you know in the sixth dimension they don't drink and it was the theophany of god that went out of that that went out the human form that didn't have eye like you see is we don't take the word of god the same thing another one comes halfway is deeper than just what oh m [Music] and they are no longer sinners by god's grace if they

beginning in the beginning [Music] [Applause] [Music] i will uh it's a dwelling place of god you know it says when god was the way it was in moses when the weight was in moses moses was god okay while you are wondering god said to moses because pharaoh was a god now god wouldn't challenge pharaoh with just a mere man challenge to be a god against a god [Music] let's make things better so that we can close essentially if god sends a prophet is god himself [Music] of the trumpets of the trumpet when abraham and sarah were looking for the coming son as he spoke to abraham he changed the body of abraham and sarah immediately after this so they could receive the sun they were older [Music] being i will come and sarah shall have a son at the appointed time so that's it now i'm trying to close with this year it says notice the last sign that they got before the sun was generally [Applause] m you see like the people today they would not tolerate god talking in the form of a man they will
