Um my brother will read the scripture Mark 10 from verse 13- 16. And they brought young children to him that he should touch them. And his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not. For of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein." and he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; The Bible said they brought their children to him. I believe it was women. Um that's why I want women to bring their children but I want men to accompany them because I don't know where was the husband of those women but what I know is that women recognize the gift in amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They brought their children to that gift. They know if if he can just touch their children, something will happen. I believe you believe the same thing. I am I am your brother. &gt;&gt; You have just chosen me to be your pastor, &gt;&gt; but I'm your brother. Um I believe I am a shepherd &gt;&gt; because the green shepherd is in me. The one who they brought the children to is in me. I believe he's going to use my hands to touch your your child. I believe when I touch your child, what you have believed, it will happen to the child. more. &gt;&gt; What is the name? &gt;&gt; Is a girl or a boy? Is a boy. God bless. My dear heavenly father as they have done there when they brought their children unto you. Here are the family. They have brought their child unto me believing that they are bringing this child unto you, heavenly father. Living in a terrible age where there are different spirits which are taking our children over. When they bring this child unto you, they believe that you will keep this child. from all those spirits. &gt;&gt; He will help them to grew the child. &gt;&gt; I give them their wish. I give them their desire &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Receive your desire my sister. Receive your desire my brother. A desire how bro my brother. How are you brother?

Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lambs and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of them were wise and five were foolish. They that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. While the bridegroom terret, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, behold, a bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him. Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil, for our lambs are gone out. But the wise answered, saying, Not so, lest there be not enough for us and you. But go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut. Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he answered and said, Verily, I say unto you, I know you not. Watch therefore, for ye know neither the door nor the hour. Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh. &gt;&gt; Thank you. We can read also uh revelation chapter 21 verse uh 20 3- 27. 21 23 27 and the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine in it. For the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp is the light thereof. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it. And the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it. And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day. For there shall be no night there. And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it. and they shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever workketh abomination or maketh a lie, but they which are written in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us close our eyes. &gt;&gt; Mighty heavenly father, &gt;&gt; I've read the scriptures here. &gt;&gt; I've got heading But I am humbly asking you father to be with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I can present your message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unto your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let let me not present my wish &gt;&gt; but let me present your message father. Use my voice, Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and my interpreter's voice, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; to carry your message, &gt;&gt; to the hearts of your children &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may take your seats. [Music] Um, elders knows me. So &gt;&gt; I'm not wrong but I don't know these days I become I seem to be wrong man. I don't know. I want but I want to go back to my system to be short and if the message seems to be wrong. Let me just cut it then I will come back to it if possible. If these elders allow me the heading of the message is uh the 10 visions &gt;&gt; and their destination. Um, I'm going to do what we call a a scriptural uh teaching something like that. &gt;&gt; Scripture scriptural lecture. &gt;&gt; Oh, I've got my students here. They've got books. Then I'm going to give them a lecture. lecture. &gt;&gt; I've got my professor &gt;&gt; Mr. I've got my lecture lecture &gt;&gt; H O D. &gt;&gt; Oh, H O D &gt;&gt; is Professor Scosa. Um I am lecturing lecture before my HO but the professor said to me he's listening whether the lecture is according to the the law of the university or is out. &gt;&gt; The professor will tell my professor &gt;&gt; tell that lecture tell that lecturer that is getting out of our laws of the university. Are you together with me there? you this thing you know them. &gt;&gt; We're just repeating what you you know there is nothing new here. &gt;&gt; A woman in the Bible represent the church. The woman in the Bible when the Bible talks about the woman in many incidences It it talks about the church &gt;&gt; because the Bible says &gt;&gt; Jesus is the head &gt;&gt; of the church. &gt;&gt; His body is the head of his body which is the church. Amen. We have got in the Bible. We have got a war prostitution. &gt;&gt; In the Bible is the church. Re chapter 17 talks about the great war which have children and her children are held. And those hellos is the church. &gt;&gt; They are like their mother. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have got the the bride &gt;&gt; which is also spoken of in the Bible and it's the church. And uh let me just read something perhaps God willing because this great war &gt;&gt; didn't go to the to wait for the bridegroom. This great door is self centered. But her children, they went there with the bride to wait for the &gt;&gt; the bridegroom. But let me just read something. In this book uh they will flush it if possible spoken it &gt;&gt; 63 63 &gt;&gt; page 63 or &gt;&gt; page 63 &gt;&gt; paragraph 31 &gt;&gt; paragraph 31 &gt;&gt; it says here &gt;&gt; now look there is there is called a war in the Bible. &gt;&gt; I want my sisters to forgive me. &gt;&gt; That is what the Bible said. That was the Bible said. &gt;&gt; Today I'm speaking just plain calls her the war the mother of her which is the same thing. Now if you notice there is a war spoke of in the Bible that is a church spoke of in the Bible that is a church the bride spoke of in the Bible that is the church there are three in the Bible then theible Bible says in page 65 paragraph 40 he says now watch then three churches there is a prostitute she didn't come for nothing she is self centered in herself there was the unwise vision which is the Protestant church and there was the bride. There is three stages of the church in the last days. We are going to bring them right straight out from the from Genesis. bringing them out here and and and place them in revelation in the rapture. The Lord willing. &gt;&gt; In other words, we want to see this visions here with us and we want to see them. in judgment or in during rapture or &gt;&gt; in judgment and want to see them in the new Jerusalem, their positions here. Where are they here? these visions &gt;&gt; because the Bible here in Matthew talks about 10 visions, the wise and the foolish. And the Bible calls them both visions. And if they are vigils, It means they are holy. &gt;&gt; It means it is a holy church. And because the Bible says here, &gt;&gt; the their only difference is that it was some have oil. Some don't have oil, but together they are visions. And if the Bible talks about foolish visions being pure, clean, &gt;&gt; then you must check yourself. Where do I belong? It it it seems as if I'm not even a vision. I don't belong I don't belong to this side this side because they are all visions that is what that is what the Bible says it's not what I'm saying that is what the Bible says he says there are visions let me read here in the 10 visions He said, he says here, paragraph 156, page 455, &gt;&gt; he says, &gt;&gt; both of them were revisions. He says here, let's take these two right here. This is a vision. This is a vision. This one a foolish vision. This was a wise vision. But both of them are visions. Now if you will take the name vision and run it down, it means holy, clean, sanctified. The word sanctified come from the word sainted which mean clean like a Hebrew word that is Greek word sanctify means cleanify the green word it makes it holymen Amen. &gt;&gt; Vision &gt;&gt; and ours in our in in our word in order in English it is same. Now we take three words and each word has the same meaning. Now spoke of different the clean holy sanctified all three. [Music] &gt;&gt; These are clean. It means This is a clean church. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; It means it was not a filthy church, but it was a clean church. &gt;&gt; These 10 visions, let me read page 383 just to emphasize The vision. Look, 10 of them. They went out where visions. There were 10 went to meet the Lord. Now the word divisions means sanctified. Does anybody know that holy pure sanctified there were 10 of them that went out to meet the Lord. Now remember they had been falling asleep in all in one watch, two watch, three watch until the seventh watch. We shall come back to Are you together with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; These visions, &gt;&gt; they were all vig some have oil and some didn't have it and I shall come to that. &gt;&gt; The wise visions are the chosen who has chosen them. All these visions they are the chosen there are those who are chosen. According to Matthew the book of Matthew 22:42 it says many are called and few are chosen. And those few which are chosen they are called the bride. They are called the wise vision. They are called they are chosen from those who are called. Are you together with me? In other those who remain because some are chosen from others and some remain. So those who remain they are called the remnant. And those remnants are called the foolish. I said who chose them? The owner. Amen. &gt;&gt; God himself. Amen. Has chosen. He said you cannot you cannot say why did he choose me or not? Why did he not choose me? The remnant is a piece that is cut left of the same good or the same clothes. That is that is what we call the remnant. Are you together with me? But let me just read something for you here about the remnant. What the what the prophet says about the remnant because the remnant is those who remain when they chosen were chosen some remain. All right. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; But now let me just read what the prophet says in this book &gt;&gt; 54 &gt;&gt; 54 &gt;&gt; I'm going to read paragraph 268. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 268. &gt;&gt; It says here what is a remnant? piece that is cut left the same kind of goods. Is that right? you go to cut you a dress out of a caligo good then you spread out the big piece of calig in other words you went to the shop you find the clothes there but you choose that among those you take that which you have chosen, which you have laughed, then you spread it upon the table out of it. Why did you choose the cal you want to make a dress out of the table? Then you put the the the goods on the table. Then out then you you take the pattern. &gt;&gt; You put it on the on the on the whole good. &gt;&gt; Then you take out the pattern. Take out the Caesar to to to take the pattern out. Just like many are called the whole the whole are called but out of the you are going to take the pattern which is the chosen. Amen. The the truth cannot say put the pattern here. I I I want to be part of the pattern. The owner has got that discretion to put the pattern here and take the scissor and cut according to the pattern. The Caesar is directed by the pattern where he had to come back. Oh, my students are hearing me. Amen. They're hearing the lecture. &gt;&gt; The Caesar &gt;&gt; is going according to pattern. &gt;&gt; The pattern is already there. When the when the when the this woman go to the shop &gt;&gt; to look for the the goods, he had the pattern. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; When he took the goose there, &gt;&gt; was already there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Before Before there was a star, before there is a speck of dust, you were there in God's mind. You were in you were the mind of God. He had you. He He He said, "I'm going to call this one." Amen. &gt;&gt; No one advised him. No preacher. Amen. &gt;&gt; He himself before the foundation of &gt;&gt; you were there in God's spine. [Music] the pattern was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read what the prophet says. It is your business where you lay the pattern is God's business is God's business where he lays the pattern. &gt;&gt; He cuts it right out. Is that right? And now this the rest of the Caligo here is just as good as the Calico. It's just as good as the as in the as in the party. Are you together with me? In other words, they left the remnant is just as perfect as the that one. But it is God's election. God elects his church. God predestinate his church. God forained that for ordained his church. He takes that church. out and the remnant is left to go through the tribulation period. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Why it is left to go through the I will tell you &gt;&gt; my students. Are you listening? All right. If you are together with me, let me go on. &gt;&gt; We have said the foolish visions are the remnant and the wise visions is the pattern taken by the owner to make her. Amen. Then after that after she has through the dress this dress is beautiful. Then she put the dress there. She went back to look at the remnant. What can I do with this remnant? Because I love them. [Music] Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Let me look for another book here. If I can find it and read it. What the prophet says about these things. &gt;&gt; The book here. Yeah, I found the book because the prophet says we preach salvation as if salvation is for all. But we know it is not for but we preach it. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we know it is not for we preach healing. We preach healing as if healing is for all. God will heal you. We say so. But we know that is not for all. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you together? &gt;&gt; Students, &gt;&gt; students. &gt;&gt; All right. Let me read something here. &gt;&gt; My my is listening. [Music] &gt;&gt; We want to read something here. The book is proving his way. I'm going to reach paragraph 88. Page 17. Paragraph 88. &gt;&gt; Amen. Page 17. Paragraph 88. &gt;&gt; Now, it is the same thing today. We are at the end time. &gt;&gt; Those people ought to have Noah. Now, you notice Noah was a type of the Jews &gt;&gt; that will be carried over. through the tribulation &gt;&gt; was a type of the real message. The real message &gt;&gt; of the translation of the church. &gt;&gt; Enoch. Yes. for Enoch was taken up and then the flood came. The first the first prophet Enoch &gt;&gt; was taken out of the ways so Noah could go on with with with his God could go on with Noah. In other words, Enoch was taken so that God can come and deal with Noah. I have said after the pattern was done the owner of the pattern come back to the remnant what to do with the remnant. Now the church will be taken away so that God can deal again with the Jews, the remnant of the Jews 144,000 144,000. &gt;&gt; We have been through it in the scripture. I will come back to this. I will tell you about that. Then I must read something here again. in the book future home &gt;&gt; if I can find it. All right. Thank you, my brother. Amen. I've got someone here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, when you lecture, you must have somebody &gt;&gt; who will say, "Here is another one. Um, uh, future home paragraph 121. home 121 &gt;&gt; uh to 122 &gt;&gt; I think it's page uh 17 was a type of the remnant that that is carried over not the translated Enoch was one man went in the rapture before the flood came showing that the church does not go into the church does not go in the tribulation. When we talk about the church, we talk about the bride does not go into or anything around it was translated. One man or that church may remember that church may be a number but the bride is going to be a very small. Amen. &gt;&gt; Many are called, &gt;&gt; few are chosen. The church may be many. The foolish visions may be many. But the bride will be shocked. They will, it says here, &gt;&gt; but the bride is going to be a very small group that will make up the bride. Now the church may be a great number. But the bride you see compare eight with one. Okay. Because one type the bride the remnant. You see now you can compare one with eight. It means the bride will be few. You see? Amen. Eight times eight times less will be the bride than the church. Amen. Amen. If the righteous scarcely be saved, where will the sinner and the ungodly appear? those who know better to do it and go ahead and do it anyhow. Those who follow the rules of denominations instead of the ways, where will they appear? He had to call the Christians taking the name of Christ but following the law of the denomination. &gt;&gt; Amen. Taking the pattern &gt;&gt; is the type of the rapture. &gt;&gt; When you take the pattern and leave the remnant type of the because the rapture is for the bride only. Even when Christ come to redeem, &gt;&gt; he was he was only he was coming only to redeem his the bride, not others. When he was praying, he was praying for the bride, not others. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says here &gt;&gt; now the rapture is only this rapture that we are talking about is only for the Amen. Remember the Bible said and the rest of the dead live not for thousand years. There is great rapture. If there is no rapture, friends, where are we at? What are we going to do? What age are we living in? What promise do we have? There is going to be rapture. The Bible says there will be. [Music] It will be only for the elected. the elected lady, the bride, the wise vision. Amen. &gt;&gt; In this day that is pulled out of the church. Amen. The Caesar going that is the message in each age. There is a Caesar which was the message for that particular age. The prophet says these seven messengers are making God known to the people. &gt;&gt; Those who have an ear Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; God is responsible for his &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; members from every denomination up the bride, the bride tree in the tape. The bride is in the tape and that is the one that the bride is that is rather that is the bride &gt;&gt; is the one that is going to be in the rapture. That that alone that alone &gt;&gt; nothing but that is going to be in the rapture but the bride the elected one fornown by God from the beginning the father spiritual gene I was in my father. I was in my grand was passed from a generation to a generation to generation until to my father because my birth was predestinated. Your birth was predestinated. You would have died while you are in the in your grandfather. Your grandfather should have been killed. But he was not killed. Amen. Because he was fighting in a battle. But he was the only one who escaped. Why? Why? Why was he why did he escape? It was because of you. You were there in his jeans. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the marriage of your father to your mother. God looked at the woman. He had your picture. He said if I to bring this picture I must bring this man this woman they will bring my picture where is predestinated [Music] is not just a miracle. &gt;&gt; There is nothing wrong with God. You can say what you want to say. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that. &gt;&gt; You see we are not forcing people. We are bringing a mirror that this is the bride. You look in the mirror, you see yourself or you don't find yourself. &gt;&gt; It's not the problem of me bringing the mirror. I'm just bringing the mirror because we are bringing the bride. [Music] Let me say this. &gt;&gt; The bride and these visions, this started back there from the first church age. But these ones we are talking about in Matthews, they are the bride of the seventh watch. They are the visions of the seventh watch. The seven church age. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The seventh watch is the seven church age. Church age. &gt;&gt; Are you together? the ones we are reading about who went to meet the bridegroom because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, a voice and a trumpet. Where is the voice? Where will the voice come from? It will come from us. [Music] If you are waiting for something to come from heaven, you are lost my sister or my brother. You miss where the voice is. While Cornelius was praying, God said Cornelius stand up. There is an answer here. Go to Job, you'll find in the house of Simon, you'll find Simon. Your answer is there. If you can go to the mountain now and pray and God answers you is not God. If if he cannot say to you, go to pastor at mayor's park, you'll get the answer. If he doesn't say that is not God, but if he's the one, he will say to you, "My son, I love you. &gt;&gt; Go to party." That's why he said to Cornelius, "Go to Job in Simon Peter's house. There is my voice there." While Peter was still speaking, while while he was still teaching them to brothers and sisters and then while we are they were they were they were busy speaking in tongues in language. They they received the Holy Spirit. Not when not even when he was he laid hands on them because he was the answer. [Music] God was there in the house of Cornelius &gt;&gt; in flesh. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are you together with us? &gt;&gt; From the first each age, it has its visions. The wise visions are those who have an ear in that age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; The wise visions are those who had an ear in that age. Those who didn't have any earl. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let me read something here. &gt;&gt; It says here, &gt;&gt; don't worry if you don't have it there. It is most evident from these scriptures that no man of himself can hear God. That ability has to be given of God. Even if the scripture says, "He that have an ear, &gt;&gt; let him hear it was directed to a specific class of not to all &gt;&gt; because that group that can hear the ability to hear. &gt;&gt; Putting these verses together, &gt;&gt; we see that there is only one group and that that very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age [Applause] is one special group. that receives the revelation for each age. That group is of God because the group that cannot hear is not of God. The group that can hear what the spirit is saying and receives the revelation is that group that distract you in the book of Corinthians. Let me go on here. They are the ones that are born of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to every age we hear the same truth. &gt;&gt; He that had an ear, let him hear what the spirit say to the churches. But only spiritfilled man can hear the revelation for that age. No one else. can hear. No sir. &gt;&gt; The difference of this vision is that some of oil which is the Holy Spirit which is in our age in our ages which is the which is the rapturing faith in our age. all the ages it was the Holy Spirit. But in our age, it is the rapture in faith. In our age, but from the first year, it was the Holy Ghost. But let me tell you, okay, those who were filled with the Holy Ghost had the word and receive it and lived it, lived by it. Those who did not have the spirit had it only as a cannal man put a wrong interpretation and went into sin and in every age every age is is the age of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; for the true believer. Those who had the spirit, the teacher had the word and the spirit in them took the word and taught it reveal it to them. And they were they were the group that had the messenger and his message took it and leave it. Amen. There were people who have got the spirit. That's what the Bible says. Joshua and they had another they were going with people. They could identify where God is. So they followed Moses. They saved Moses. They saved Moses. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they've seen God. They were not saving Moses per se, but they were saving God in Moses. Amen. Because they had another spirit. Even now, if you have got another spirit, you will save correctly. Amen. But if you don't have a spirit, you will paramulate. Those who have got the spirit, those have an ear, they could hear the message from the messenger and receive it and the spirit in them feel it to them. They were born with something in them just like an igllet. It was born being an eagle. It was the It has the eagle nature in it. It didn't acquire the nature of an eagle, but it was born with a nature. It was an eagle by birth. If you are the child of God, you are born with something in you. [Applause] It will not come someday. &gt;&gt; There was a little Brennham there which is a nature &gt;&gt; which which can receive the word. Amen. He says &gt;&gt; if you fish, if you throw a net into the when you take it out, &gt;&gt; it comes with many things, &gt;&gt; frogs, catps, water snakes. You must know a frog was a frog to begin with. before they can throw the net. The frog was a frog. The net cannot change the frog. But the owner of the net was looking for the fish. When he throw things on the on the shoulder, he was looking for the fish. The frog will go back into the water. This is what the prophet says. &gt;&gt; It's not me. &gt;&gt; It is what what I want to say. I'm talking about the wise vision. It was she was born wise. He was a vision. among the visions but wise. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No way she could tend to be foolish. No way foolish could tend to be wise. &gt;&gt; The pattern has declared. Amen. This one is foolish. This one is that is what God said. &gt;&gt; I said every age is the age of the Holy Spirit. For a true believer, &gt;&gt; the group that have the the spirit, they have the ear is those who hear the messenger. Hear the message through the messenger and receive the message of the message and live it because it is their life. They cannot do otherwise because this is their life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you are you with me then? I said if my message is still going on, I will cut it. Um these are the visions. These ones which we have read about are the visions of the seventh watch. But I said in each age in each watch there was vision they died there. The wise died there with oil. &gt;&gt; The foolish died there without oil. Amen. They are part of these ones of the seventh watch. And the wise visions from the first watch are are part of these ones of the seventh watch because both of them they have got they they place where they have to wait. Because when they died there, they had the place where they had to wait. Some because some they were waiting for the second resurrection which are the foolish and some which are the wise vision or waiting for the first vis. Are you together? Then they wait somewhere. This foolish they must wait for at the fifth dimension for purification. They must be purified. Are you together? Because we have got the remnant of the Jews. Read it my brother. Just read Revelation chapter 12 I think. So my brother verse uh the last verse &gt;&gt; which is uh verse 17 verse &gt;&gt; verse 17 &gt;&gt; 17. And the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; All right, let me check my book here. &gt;&gt; He's talking about the let me read the read it again the brother. And the dragon was wrath with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They kept the commandment of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. the commandment of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. You see this here there are two groups. The other group kept the law of God keep the commandments of another group. Another group kept testimony of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; These are the remnant of the Jews. who are keeping the commandment of God. These are the remnant of the Gentiles who are came the testimony of Jesus Christ. Are you together with me? You see these two the the the beast here is fighting with them. It is during tribulation. We find them here. Revelation chapter 15. My brother, read it there. &gt;&gt; Uh verse 1 to three. &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to 3. And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them is is filled up with wrath of God. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the hubs of God. You see in the Old Testament this sea of place it was called the lover. It was called the lover. It was there in the Old Testament in the gentile time. Before the sacrifice can be given, it must be brought to this level to be washed. It was a time of the baptism before you can be because the Bible says Paul says bring your bodies as a living sacrifice acceptable unto God. Before you can bring your body, you must go through baptism because it was timed there before they can be taken to the to be sacrificed, they must go through the lamb because when when Moses was building the temple, God said according the pattern &gt;&gt; which I show you on the The prophet said, "What Moses saw there is what John saw in chapter 4." John and because John saw it in heaven. Moses saw it also in heaven. God said, "Make it here on earth." But when they when he when he see the It was empty out of it. There was no more water but there was fire coming. It means if you to go there you were you will be tribulated. Amen. &gt;&gt; There were people who were found standing there. It was the foolish vision because after realizing that there are some people who have been who have been teaching baptism here that we must be baptized. They tried to go there to to be baptized in the name of the Lord. They found the beast waiting for them there because the beast was looking for the people who were been who were baptizing like this. People were people were following this and those people were raptured. And these foolish visions, they were late. When they tried to go there, they were tribulated. They found that it is the time of tribulation because they found the fire. Then when I have read said h the beast was wroth with the remnant of the woman. They say those who kept the commandment testimony of Jesus. I said there were two here. I said the foolish visions and the 144,000 are the remnant of the Jews 144 and then the foolish visions are the remnant of the Gentiles they were together there. Let me just some quotes and I'm going to truth and I'm going to come back if God willing. But let me read this quote. The prophet is saying something is the seven seag page 501 or page 501. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 227. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 227. &gt;&gt; I read it here. Um 57 says here now if God is going to patch that vision that was good woman but she just failed to get the oil in her lamp. He she was a good woman. was a vision but she didn't have oil for for that she must go through &gt;&gt; to be patched that's why I said through the ages they must also be patched like the seventh group because this seventh group it ped by tribulation. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, &gt;&gt; he says if God is going to p that woman who was a good woman but just to get oil in her lamp going to p her through persecution in there. He puts them tribes right in there for the same thing and p them during the time of tribulation because it is perching. It's just the judgment.

Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom he have crucified, both Lord and Christ.

Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
