[12:08] because if you you can't see the
[12:11] supernatural things with natural eyes
[12:19] all right
[12:21] now that's why today
[12:28] even when we were coming this way
[12:31] [Music]
[12:32] I was saying that they need
[12:36] uh
[12:38] we have we are not
[12:42] The Message Church

[13:15] um
[13:16] give birth to another bride
[13:24] once the bread eternally debride
[13:29] um
[13:32] that's why today we are the one here
[13:38] and
[13:41] God has forgiven our sins any
[13:49] so that we can do what
[13:53] so that we forgive
[14:00] certainness we don't have
[14:04] we are together again from Heaven
[14:09] God bless you God bless you
[14:12] this is
[14:25] expect to see the same brother

[14:35] foreign
[15:09] we are happy to be with you here amen
[15:17] and to be welcomed by the hand of the
[15:20] spiritual hand no that's why we are
[15:24] going to look into the scriptures
[15:29] and
[15:30] let's look at the the requirement
[15:39] s you know the prophet of God say so
[15:43] um
[15:45] yeah there's things coming up today
[15:51] saying things
[15:55] about the brother Brennan
[15:58] the name of non-profit Williams
[16:02] the things that came around
[16:09] saying things about the Lord Jesus
[16:12] Christ
[16:17] amen and now let's take this subject
[16:21] here other
[16:25] person I was looking here in the book
[16:30] where it says
[16:33] Adam
[16:35] could not meet
[16:38] the requirement
[16:40] of
[16:41] Redemption
[16:43] [Music]
[16:46] um
[16:51] because Redemption
[16:55] it's taking something or going back
[16:59] to where you
[17:04] you were where you will come from
[17:14] it's a great subjects
[17:18] it is the return of the seeds
[17:25] as we're going to read out of here some
[17:28] scriptures
[17:33] and we have realized
[17:36] that
[17:39] we are in the end
[17:45] we are at the ending
[17:50] the end actually started there in
[17:53] Genesis
[17:55] foreign
[18:04] this day is called
[18:07] the beginning
[18:10] the end of the beginning
[18:12] [Music]
[18:23] let's look at it again
[18:27] now the Bible says in the beginning was
[18:31] the word the Bible is we
[18:36] I'm told that today we don't have our
[18:40] uh projectile
[18:44] they say we don't have our projector
[18:50] okay
[18:53] Baba
[18:58] yo but we don't have it
[19:01] foreign
[19:16] talk
[19:17] um
[19:20] there are things
[19:22] I was supposed to project
[19:24] okay
[19:28] now let's start by saying
[19:35] I will start again
[19:37] in the beginning was
[19:41] the word
[19:44] I'll use my finger instead of a
[19:47] projector
[19:49] project in the beginning
[19:53] now you've got to go
[19:55] backwards
[20:04] now and the word
[20:06] foreign
[20:15] you say you are going backwards
[20:23] the word wasn't
[20:27] living
[20:29] so you are going backwards
[20:32] um
[20:35] now that's why Genesis
[20:39] was the beginning why is it
[20:44] all of the end
[20:49] today is the
[20:51] is there

[44:27] so now
[44:29] we are here now now
[44:32] chapter four such was a scene
[44:36] uh
[44:38] and John in the spirit standing here in
[44:41] heaven
[44:45] he has been lifted up now from the
[44:49] church ages
[44:57] and John was privileged amen
[45:04] when at the Isle of Patmos after
[45:07] springing the facts as a Patmos
[45:10] he was lifted up
[45:15] now you know sometimes brother Brennan
[45:17] would say the angel picked me up
[45:23] um
[45:25] now people think that John was lifted up
[45:28] Flying high in the skies no
[45:36] the John that was lifted up is the
[45:39] theophany
[45:40] of joy uh
[45:47] hallelujah amen now I read
[45:52] oh
[45:54] I think today you will listen to this
[45:56] scripture
[46:01] John in the spirit standing here in
[46:04] heaven
[46:08] he has just been lifted up from the
[46:11] church ages
[46:18] now this is not coming from the church
[46:20] ages because he has just been lifted
[46:29] now you can hear this from the church
[46:31] ages
[46:35] or from any being
[46:38] siding in the church through the church
[46:41] ages
[46:46] Andy John saw the church ages foreign
[47:32] [Music]
[47:33] so that's why he was lifted up from the
[47:37] [Music]
[47:38] um
[47:43] then it says again
[47:47] he said now come higher
[47:49] yeah I'm going to show you things
[47:53] that will come on
[47:58] not from the ages
[48:02] not from the ages
[48:09] um shall we repeat this one I don't know
[48:12] whether it's a reputation or what
[48:13] Revelation chapter 21.
[48:19] verse 9.
[48:25] verse 9. and they came unto me one of
[48:29] the Seven Angels which had the seven
[48:32] virus full of the seven last names and
[48:35] talk with me say come hither I will show
[48:39] Thee the bright the lamps one okay

[49:11] then I will show you emperor
[49:17] you know how that's how the message
[49:21] unfolding
[49:28] it is in some dimensions
[49:32] [Music]
[49:35] in some spheres
[49:40] can hear one here
[49:43] and failed to hear the next chapter
[49:50] now so that's why
[49:54] God has to lift up John
[49:58] um
[50:00] if he is not lifted up
[50:03] he will not be able to hear what follows
[50:09] even today

[50:42] level wow
[50:49] and started to speak to his bride from

[54:35] will look at it
[54:39] then the Lord willing
[54:41] we will get into it
[54:46] because no but myself
[54:50] I always tell myself I can't remain in
[54:53] one place
[55:00] something that is not moving on
[55:06] amen it will start
[55:12] fulfill for a short time discussion and
[55:16] realization you can enjoy or think that
[55:19] you have started
[55:22] if you don't move to the next
[55:27] that thing starts to rotating
[55:33] and next time
[55:35] all things you have left behind
[55:39] assembly They Come and catch up with you
[55:42] there
[55:44] the children of Israel
[55:47] when they arrive in the Red Sea um
[55:51] and they started to
[55:54] um murmur and they practiced against
[55:56] Moses
[55:59] so God said to Moses
[56:03] Moses Moses tell the children of Israel
[56:07] go forward
[56:11] did you read that scripture
[56:13] he never said tell them to fast to pray
[56:20] there's a Time need to fast and pray we
[56:24] need to move

[56:32] praying fasting
[56:37] residing in one place

[57:59] Moses
[58:01] tell them
[58:03] to do what
[58:04] um to go forward
[58:10] amen amen because
[58:13] they are in their own territory
[58:17] they are in the wrong place
[58:19] persons are waiting
[58:20] they are
[58:22] praying in the wrong place but friends
[58:26] worshiping in their own place
[58:29] abundance when they're wrong and there's
[58:31] no spiritual results
[58:44] [Music]
[58:46] to go forward
[58:50] because they had three stages of the
[58:53] journey

[1:14:07] the first Throne was in heaven amen
[1:14:17] [Music]
