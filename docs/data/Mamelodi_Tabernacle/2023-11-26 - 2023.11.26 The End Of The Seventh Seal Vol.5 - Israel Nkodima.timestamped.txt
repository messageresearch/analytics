[26:20] the space of half an
[26:23] hour you may be
[26:26] seated
[26:28] [Music]
[26:36] uh there's a uh
[26:42] another message here
[26:45] from
[26:46] Brother
[26:53] gabrielson it raed this
[26:56] way

[27:01] dream J brother Bram told the people to
[27:05] look in that mountain on the White
[27:15] Rock but many
[27:20] left I believe you are listening and
[27:24] understand
[27:26] that they were
[27:28] many people
[27:31] there but he said to
[27:36] them as if she wanted to
[27:45] select
[27:47] uh when he
[27:49] said
[27:52] look in that
[27:56] mountain on the White
[28:00] Rock but many
[28:04] [Music]
[28:06] left amen
[28:09] amen that's
[28:11] why we have the seventh
[28:17] [Music]
[28:21] seal uh but many
[28:26] left and
[28:28] people are
[28:31] leaving because there's a white
[28:38] stone some
[28:41] remain
[28:42] [Music]
[28:45] look now here is the brother's a
[28:49] quotation from Brother
[28:55] ke now he says
[28:59] as brother I want call the name
[29:03] spoke
[29:05] brother this is brother gabri
[29:09] saying as brother
[29:13] spoke how they saw their
[29:15] own reflection in
[29:24] there now in
[29:26] Revelation
[29:28] 2 verse
[29:30] 177 the P Church age it
[29:36] speaks of being given a white
[29:42] stone with a new
[29:47] name
[29:51] written now if you know
[29:56] somebody Maybe maybe the name is Israel
[30:00] or Abraham or so
[30:06] forth now
[30:08] if he is given a
[30:14] stone with a new
[30:19] name
[30:22] written which only he that receives
[30:26] knows
[30:33] only he that receives that
[30:39] name you know in the Book of
[30:43] Revelation where it speaks
[30:46] of that
[30:50] name of which only
[30:54] the
[30:56] Lord know that
[31:02] name
[31:04] now meaning he is called by a
[31:09] name that is known only to
[31:15] himself
[31:17] and for me to call that
[31:22] name I must first receive a
[31:26] revelation

[56:29] it let's let's
[56:34] continue let me it says no ear has
[56:44] hurt if you have
[56:47] heard amen you then it means you have
[56:50] heard from your
[56:52] theop now that's why more
[56:56] now that's where here we're not talking
[56:58] about
[56:59] ears amen amen the gospel
[57:05] re it's not when a person talks to
[57:09] you I can't
[57:11] hear sorou

[57:19] heart
[57:20] amen
[57:23] amen you can speak
[57:26] louder What My
[57:30] Title is
[57:33] this now you find the person that is
[57:35] here is not listening to you or he's not
[57:38] hearing
[57:42] you what is
[57:46] that he s
[57:50] here the ears are even clean but you can
[57:55] you
[58:02] amen he can
[58:04] hear
[58:07] now now we are going to talk about
[58:09] things that cannot
[58:11] be by the ears
[58:18] amen there's a language of
[58:20] God that cannot be heard by ears amen
[58:27] even that
[58:28] title cannot be listened to by the
[58:32] [Music]
[58:33] ears
[58:35] because you have
[58:37] heard from
[58:42] your amen okay
[58:46] amen uh let me read
[58:53] something I'm watching my time I'm going
[58:55] to close but we are just preparing for
[58:58] to go
[59:03] somewhere before you can go
[59:09] higher you
[59:13] go
[59:17] am say the very Lord that went
[59:21] down he is the same one that ascended up
[59:24] above all to
[59:28] cover
[59:30] cover did you hear
[59:35] that we will read it
[59:39] also very same one that went so
[59:44] high is the same one who went deep deep
[59:48] down all right
[59:53] amen
[1:00:04] right we've before we close now you are
[1:00:07] going to
[1:00:08] realize when Jesus spoke one
[1:00:13] day I am from
[1:00:17] above and you are
[1:00:23] from amen but why the people dispute
[1:00:29] that underworld under
[1:00:32] under what is this is it not there in
[1:00:35] the Bible is it not there in the spoken
[1:00:39] word
[1:00:41] no such a big cry what is
[1:00:45] it haven't you read that they is the
[1:00:52] underworld there's another
[1:00:56] under of the people that says they
[1:00:58] working
[1:01:00] underworld and you find there police
[1:01:02] looking for
[1:01:04] them that one the people believe it they
[1:01:08] say yes it's
[1:01:10] there but if you come with this one of
[1:01:12] the
[1:01:15] Bible now you're causing a big
[1:01:22] fight if I can read it
[1:01:26] again it will still be the same now
[1:01:30] listen before
[1:01:32] we the thing that people can that's why
[1:01:35] it says you from
[1:01:41] your a person that has not heard
[1:01:44] from you can repeat one thing he will
[1:01:47] never believe it
[1:01:52] amen and
[1:01:55] in most
[1:01:57] cases to reject a
[1:02:00] thing it is
[1:02:04] because if you are not if you are part
[1:02:07] of
[1:02:10] Christ how can you reject him
[1:02:15] no if you are part of
[1:02:19] him if you are part of the word of
[1:02:23] God cannot reject that
[1:02:27] because you are made by that weight
[1:02:41] amen I'm still looking for I asked for
[1:02:48] it
[1:02:51] amen it
[1:02:53] says
[1:02:55] he that is
[1:02:58] filthy let him be filthy
[1:03:03] still
[1:03:06] amen
[1:03:08] amen Revelation chter 22:1 amen he that
[1:03:13] is unjust let him be unjust still and he
[1:03:17] which is filthy let him be filthy Ste
[1:03:21] and he that is righteous let him be
[1:03:23] righteous still
[1:03:25] and he that is Holy let him be holy
[1:03:27] still
[1:03:28] amen we'll come and read to
[1:03:32] you
[1:03:35] H what the prophet has said about
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:44] this he that is
[1:03:47] filthy let him be filthy
[1:03:51] still he was referring to a Ty
[1:03:56] a certain time when he that is
[1:04:00] filthy will continue to
[1:04:07] be
[1:04:12] meaning it is taking things from the
[1:04:20] roots that's why it says if you see a
[1:04:23] tree
[1:04:27] you see a big
[1:04:34] tree you don't actually see the what is
[1:04:38] the actual
[1:04:40] tree is hidden
[1:04:44] under
[1:04:47] as life when you see a person living a
[1:04:50] righteous life you don't see you don't
[1:04:55] how how can this manage to live such a
[1:05:00] life while we're not Str but you can't
[1:05:03] live that kind of
[1:05:08] life now let me tell you
[1:05:14] something let me say to
[1:05:17] you the Bible
[1:05:19] says one who hates his brother is like k
[1:05:32] meaning
[1:05:34] that
[1:05:37] once let me say you you hate your I'm
[1:05:41] just giving a
[1:05:45] CH or you even have a list of those that
[1:05:48] you
[1:05:51] hate and you
[1:05:53] have
[1:05:54] this one I hate because and this one is
[1:05:57] because amen
[1:06:00] amen and then you take the Bible and go
[1:06:02] to the the
[1:06:04] very it says one who is like amen any
[1:06:10] and you have
[1:06:12] it you're working with
[1:06:17] it do you believe they ask you now what
[1:06:20] do you me what's written in this
[1:06:23] book yes why
[1:06:26] not but to tell the
[1:06:30] truth I believe some of
[1:06:34] the not
[1:06:40] everything like when it says if you hate
[1:06:43] your
[1:06:48] brother yes there's one that I
[1:06:53] hate
[1:06:55] because when we hate we actually hate
[1:06:58] the behavior of a
[1:07:01] person that's what we
[1:07:04] hate there I don't want to lie to
[1:07:09] you
[1:07:11] amen even
[1:07:14] God there's things that God cannot
[1:07:17] tolerate at
[1:07:18] [Music]
[1:07:21] all that's why he bends them he's going
[1:07:24] to bend them with fire
[1:07:27] amen amen
[1:07:32] amen that's what they call
[1:07:39] hatreds did you hear
[1:07:43] that why why can't
[1:07:45] it move from you leave
[1:07:50] you it's
[1:07:52] because it has got roots in
[1:07:55] [Music]
[1:07:56] you anything that cannot move from you
[1:08:02] rooted it has Got
[1:08:07] Roots now the one who preaches he
[1:08:11] preaches you can even see the tree
[1:08:13] shifting like
[1:08:14] this the thing is this thing has
[1:08:20] rots
[1:08:22] amen that's right
[1:08:28] if you take or take a tree
[1:08:32] out and they say it's m who planted
[1:08:40] that brother
[1:08:43] it's
[1:08:45] okay
[1:08:47] so those who
[1:08:49] knows they say you must uproot it from
[1:08:53] the The
[1:08:56] Roots if you cut it you've not done
[1:09:06] anything does not preach you the head am
[1:09:10] you have heard from
[1:09:13] [Applause]
[1:09:17] your this is the things we are going to
[1:09:19] talk
[1:09:21] about while we are still alive I've got
[1:09:24] them line
[1:09:26] up we still are going to the White
[1:09:32] Stone because this white
[1:09:35] stone one the the prophet spoke of it
[1:09:38] one
[1:09:43] time what that's why I called
[1:09:46] it
[1:09:48] flying
[1:09:52] interpretation you'll see it we come
[1:09:57] there brother
[1:09:59] gabrion also spoke of that
