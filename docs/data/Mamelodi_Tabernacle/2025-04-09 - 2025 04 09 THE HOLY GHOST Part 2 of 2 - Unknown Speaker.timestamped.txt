[0:03] [Music]
[0:29] for you to see what is in the
[0:33] first you should be standing on the
[0:36] mountain on the
[0:42] seventh you've got to see it when you
[0:45] are upon the
[0:48] mountain you can
[0:51] start from beneath the
[0:54] mountain coming
[0:57] up amen amen because you don't start
[1:01] there you start
[1:03] here when you are
[1:07] here let me show you
[1:09] something in the
[1:12] Bible just read Revelation chapter
[1:16] [Music]
[1:20] 21y
[1:26] apyp one of the seven angels
[1:30] which had the seven VES full of the
[1:33] seven last plages and talk with me
[1:37] saying come hither I'll show Thee the
[1:41] bride the Lamb's
[1:56] wife and carry on
[2:00] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[2:03] a great and high mountain and show me
[2:07] that great City the holy Jerusalem
[2:11] descending Out of Heaven from
[2:24] God amen
[2:26] amen he said come up here
[2:33] yeah because you must be
[2:39] somewhere the prophet speaks of the
[2:42] three
[2:45] Maj they have seen his in the
[2:50] east from the position where they were
[2:55] standing then he continues to say you
[2:59] should be in the the
[3:03] right the Bible
[3:08] says
[3:10] Abraham woke up in the
[3:14] morning and went to the place where he
[3:17] stood before the
[3:23] Lord when he were when he approached the
[3:28] place he saw
[3:31] Sodom
[3:35] burning for him to see Sodom
[3:39] B he had to return to that
[3:42] place where he stood before the
[3:46] Lord because from that
[3:48] place he could see down to
[3:53] Sodom and he knew that
[3:57] morning to see it he has to go
[4:03] abroad you've got to
[4:07] move you some things you can't see in
[4:09] the denominations you can't see
[4:12] them to move
[4:17] higher you've got to find the right
[4:22] spot amen amen when you can view and
[4:26] review
[4:29] amen you've got to be in the right
[4:34] place now elishah
[4:38] knew he started just as a
[4:45] follower passing through some
[4:49] ages Church
[4:52] ages it was a
[4:56] journey he would come to Ephesus Church
[5:01] he had not yet
[5:04] come he followed all the
[5:08] churches until to
[5:11] Jordan which
[5:16] means amen amen then he
[5:21] followed until he crossed
[5:27] over now it was two types of
[5:32] Believers the ones on this side of
[5:36] Jordan and the one the other side of
[5:43] Jordan for he followed that
[5:47] Spirit he needed to be
[5:51] baptized with the
[5:53] spirit where a formal church member
[5:56] would just say amen God send us Elijah
[5:59] the prophet
[6:02] and that's far he can
[6:04] go Elijah has sent us Elijah the prophet
[6:08] God has sent us Elijah the
[6:10] prophet but not
[6:14] Elijah elishah was not a stationary
[6:18] [Music]
[6:22] believer every time
[6:26] moving to perfection
[6:30] he knew that something must happen to
[6:34] him and that thing is with
[6:38] Elijah that's why he cried out where is
[6:42] the god of
[6:44] Elijah and we need a people today who
[6:48] will cry out and say where is the god of
[6:54] brother not the people not the people
[6:57] only know how to code
[7:02] amen but the people who want to grasp
[7:10] life and brother says
[7:14] El wanted to be like
[7:18] Elijah because Elijah has set a
[7:24] standard now he knew that for me to say
[7:28] I'm in the
[7:32] message I must reach that
[7:35] standard you know God will always put up
[7:38] a
[7:40] standard that's why Mal 3 Mal
[7:45] 4
[7:46] 10 not that God has
[7:52] said everything below
[7:57] that is below the standard
[8:03] the seven
[8:08] SE all
[8:10] right
[8:12] Elijah
[8:15] followed and
[8:18] followed and
[8:22] followed amen amen and he couldn't
[8:26] change churches
[8:30] because he he has seen it in
[8:35] Elijah he couldn't join up with any
[8:37] other
[8:38] [Music]
[8:40] Organization no there was a
[8:43] pool coming from
[8:47] Elijah so he just
[8:49] followed until on the other
[8:55] side and once on the other
[8:58] side was the only Soul
[9:03] member that was the size of the
[9:07] church on the other
[9:10] side you see the size of the church on
[9:12] the other side of the seven Church
[9:19] ages it is in the
[9:24] minority the church on the other side
[9:28] [Music]
[9:32] one time Jesus had a big
[9:37] crowd and he blessed
[9:40] bread and fed
[9:45] thousands a big Crow crowd
[9:49] there believing that he's the prophet of
[9:54] God the Bible says they even wanted to
[9:58] make him a king
[10:03] a king that could multiply bread and
[10:12] fish amen amen they
[10:15] thought if we can make this man our
[10:21] King there won't be
[10:23] any hunger
[10:29] it will be
[10:32] a like a Communist
[10:37] Party amen
[10:39] amen every
[10:42] morning we just go with a boy with a
[10:45] fish and say Lord this is what do we
[10:50] have
[10:52] then multipli MP amen amen even the
[10:57] fishermen will stop bothering the doing
[10:59] fishing
[11:06] because then after that he moved
[11:10] on to the other
[11:13] side he took a ship to the other
[11:18] side the Bible
[11:21] says that big
[11:24] crowd they were back the next morning
[11:31] no one was
[11:35] late amen amen came with their
[11:40] families that God has sent us a
[11:45] prophet amen amen you can say bye-bye to
[11:48] hunger
[11:51] okay when they
[11:53] AR at the very same spot
[11:59] yesterday's
[12:02] spot amen you know the word of God keeps
[12:06] on moving
[12:11] on all right yesterday's spot they came
[12:16] there the Bible
[12:18] says he was not
[12:21] there so they look for for
[12:25] him even they didn't mind to pay for CR
[12:29] to the other
[12:33] side actually they they wanted to bring
[12:37] him
[12:41] back they would didn't allow him to be a
[12:43] prophet in another place they
[12:50] wanted when they arrive from the other
[12:54] side they realized
[12:57] that he has changed the
[13:03] message amen
[13:05] amen he has changed the
[13:10] message amen amen and said to
[13:14] them
[13:17] except you drink you eat the Flesh of
[13:21] the son of
[13:24] man and drink his
[13:26] blood you have no life in you
[13:32] they walked
[13:36] away they walked
[13:39] away from
[13:41] him and the Bible
[13:43] says they never never again followed
[13:48] [Music]
[13:51] him
[13:53] because it went now
[13:55] into another pH or or a the next
[14:02] stage now the people don't want the next
[14:08] stage they want to remain in yesterday
[14:14] stage
[14:15] amen all right now it says
[14:19] here look at
[14:22] it uh the bride of
[14:26] Christ uh by the holy
[14:29] ghost baptized into the
[14:33] body
[14:35] now first let's look this is this body
[14:38] before we just close
[14:43] here why is the body of
[14:49] Christ I sometimes he the people talking
[14:53] about the founders the founders
[14:59] but the founders that I
[15:02] know they are in the
[15:06] Bible it's when
[15:09] Philip said to
[15:12] Nathaniel we have found
[15:17] him he didn't said we have started a
[15:22] church he
[15:24] says we have found
[15:31] not we have found his
[15:34] books we have found his
[15:38] quotations no it was beyond
[15:43] that because
[15:45] Moses did write of
[15:48] him prophets prophesied of him now he
[15:53] was no
[15:54] longer a scripture or prophecy
[16:01] and they said we have found
[16:06] him amen amen it's not a scripture now
[16:11] it's not a
[16:12] prophecy it's a
[16:17] fulfillment they spoke about him but now
[16:21] he is
[16:26] here let me read to you something here
[16:33] uh the bride of
[16:36] Christ the church only came into view
[16:44] once you know at
[16:48] Pentecost it came once the church but
[16:52] the bride came in
[16:56] twice okay you know as we are in the
[17:00] second
[17:02] round not the first the first that's at
[17:10] Pentecost okay now here we
[17:14] go but the the Bride come in
[17:22] twice uh the seed fell in the ground at
[17:26] nasia Rome
[17:30] that was the original
[17:34] seed and she's come through the process
[17:37] of this
[17:41] denominations which only comes in
[17:44] existence
[17:47] once but the bride returns back again in
[17:50] the last
[17:54] days for the Lord said I will restore
[18:01] the Masterpiece is brought
[18:07] up that's the
[18:09] reason she was
[18:13] reviewed the second
[18:15] time she was reviewed the first
[18:18] time then she was reviewed the second
[18:24] time and she's perfectly the second time
[18:27] like she was the first
[18:34] time before the
[18:39] n and all others never appeared no
[18:46] more they come
[18:48] once and they are
[18:52] gone they went out never to come back
[18:55] again
[18:59] to come back doesn't mean to come back
[19:01] to
[19:03] church we are talking of the
[19:08] supernatural you know there was war in
[19:11] heaven and the Bible
[19:14] says like it says there was a
[19:18] woman Revelation
[19:20] 12 let me cut it short a
[19:24] bit it says the Dragon
[19:29] that stood before the
[19:34] woman she drew a third part of he of the
[19:38] stars of
[19:42] Heaven down and cast them down to
[19:46] earth now uh verse seven there was war
[19:51] in
[19:52] heaven Satan and his angels fought and
[19:55] Michael and his angels
[19:58] so Satan Was
[20:02] Defeated did you know
[20:05] that although some people worship
[20:09] Him He Was
[20:13] Defeated he is now only armed with
[20:20] lies he is equipped with
[20:26] lies he has lost the key
[20:31] he has lost the
[20:34] power amen
[20:36] amen now somebody says he has
[20:41] power yes to his
[20:46] Believers to us he has no
[20:53] power he's a fallen angel
[20:58] Isaiah saw him
[21:04] limping when he hit the
[21:09] ground and even to
[21:12] today he is on a
[21:19] wheelchair from that day from that
[21:23] day he was confirmed to confined to a
[21:27] wheelchair
[21:29] [Music]
[21:33] but there's some people who go and
[21:35] worship
[21:35] [Music]
[21:41] him okay now the Bible says they were
[21:45] cast out
[21:47] Down cast down and their place was no
[21:52] longer found in
[21:57] heaven now if a man is cornered in a
[22:01] corner and there's no more place for
[22:05] him he will start tricks and lies and
[22:10] you
[22:14] know if you worship
[22:16] Satan you worship a street
[22:23] kid he has no home no place
[22:32] when God separated water from
[22:36] water you know
[22:39] Satan he went with the flats that went
[22:42] to one
[22:47] side and establish himself under the
[22:55] sea I know you don't believe it
[22:59] in the end time it
[23:00] says the Beast shall come out of
[23:04] [Music]
[23:07] there I'll read to you the things that
[23:10] are in the
[23:15] sea okay amen that's why Revelation
[23:19] chapter
[23:20] 21 speaks of new Heaven and Earth
[23:23] without the sea
[23:31] amen because the sea became The Hiding
[23:35] [Music]
[23:38] Place amen amen so God is going to get
[23:42] rid of the
[23:47] SE in the
[23:49] new Heaven and
[23:51] Earth God bless you let me finish
[23:55] this all others
[23:59] now we are talking about the Holy Spirit
[24:01] bride of
[24:05] Christ a building fly joined
[24:11] together that is the
[24:13] spirit of
[24:15] God Ephesian Church the spirit of God up
[24:20] the spirit of
[24:22] God uhhuh now because it's a spirit of
[24:26] God you can join it
[24:30] you are baptized into
[24:34] it because the material is
[24:37] Spirit now you are baptized into it by
[24:41] the
[24:44] spirit amen
[24:46] amen all
[24:48] right all others never appeared no
[24:53] more they went out never to come back
[24:56] again
[24:58] but the bride came
[25:00] back because she is Alpha and
[25:06] Omega amen you see his
[25:10] body he is Alpha and
[25:13] Omega his body is Alpha and
[25:17] Omega he cannot marry any any other
[25:23] thing amen amen if he is the
[25:27] word B says the bride should be the
[25:32] word he can't marry a cre or
[25:36] Dogma he has to
[25:38] marry his own
[25:43] wife and his own
[25:45] wife should come from
[25:51] him Adam did not go
[25:56] around the PS and churches looking for a
[26:02] woman already she was in
[26:08] him now the Lord
[26:10] Jesus doesn't run short of the
[26:16] church no because it was in
[26:21] [Music]
[26:23] him all right so now he only came to
[26:28] reveal
[26:32] her because when he is
[26:36] revealed the whole body is
[26:42] revealed he came to
[26:46] reveal the woman in
[26:51] him the
[26:54] wife amen amen not just a woman just
[26:58] but the
[27:01] wife the Queen the
[27:05] queen
[27:07] okay I've seen some people calling
[27:09] themselves Queen queens of the
[27:16] underworld queens of the queens of the
[27:22] ocean with some
[27:24] plastic crowns
[27:30] I'm sorry you are going to lose that
[27:37] Crown there's only one Queen to the
[27:43] crown that is M
[27:49] Jesus any que is BAS let's
[27:53] [Music]
[27:55] read here it says
[27:59] for she is Alpha and
[28:03] Omega God the great
[28:06] sculptor has made him a a
[28:11] masterpiece amen amen now we are
[28:16] thankful for that
[28:18] but let us get the right thing the last
[28:21] thing
[28:26] here as the church is the spirit of
[28:30] God so the body should be the spirit of
[28:35] God amen amen can I read it to
[28:39] you all right I will find it
[28:44] here in the word brother bam
[28:48] says uh the church is the is the
[28:55] individuals yeah the Bible says so
[28:58] it is the
[29:01] individuals baptized with the Holy
[29:04] Ghost they make the
[29:08] bride H forgive me while I'm trying to
[29:10] read
[29:13] here okay
[29:16] now as in the
[29:19] individuals these VES and
[29:22] things you know seven
[29:25] VES as Peter has
[29:28] put it to
[29:29] you you have seven
[29:32] virtues because he
[29:35] says the man who lth this
[29:40] seven cannot see a far
[29:45] off amen amen so you you need seven
[29:51] Vil that builds
[29:56] you because because God said be ye
[30:00] therefore
[30:03] perfect the Lord
[30:06] Jesus be
[30:09] therefore as your father in Heaven
[30:15] is
[30:18] okay that's the
[30:20] standard if God is
[30:23] perfect he says be ye therefore
[30:31] perfect now for God to come into
[30:36] us it will only be through the
[30:40] spirit as he said to them the spirit
[30:44] dwells with
[30:46] you it was not in them he dwelt with
[30:50] them and he said then it shall be in you
[30:58] I don't know maybe right now you are
[31:00] dwelling with the
[31:03] spirit but it should
[31:08] be in
[31:10] you
[31:11] amen for I will read you something
[31:16] here while
[31:18] I'm I'm watching my RO
[31:23] watching when God made
[31:26] things he was working on a
[31:30] pattern because what he wanted to
[31:33] achieve was a man in his own
[31:38] image he couldn't have a man here on
[31:42] Earth who is
[31:45] [Music]
[31:47] lesser that's why today you are here to
[31:50] hear the word of
[31:52] God do you see God there
[32:03] uhhuh so he made
[32:07] man to be his bookes
[32:13] man he made man as a vessel to
[32:21] indwell now if you are
[32:24] predestinated you will look for the men
[32:33] God said let us make men in our
[32:37] image and the people working here on
[32:42] Earth they cannot
[32:45] stop I can't
[32:47] worship until I find that
[32:54] man not from the bible school but from
[32:57] God
[33:02] amen amen and the thing that will put me
[33:05] together with my own
[33:09] kind is the Holy
[33:13] Ghost be ye therefore
[33:16] holy you are baptized into the
[33:22] body lastly there's something here
[33:28] when God was working on a
[33:31] pattern upon the earth a
[33:35] Perfection this is your
[33:39] Masterpiece and that was a
[33:43] man finally there came forth upon the
[33:46] earth a
[33:50] Perfection when God was
[33:54] creating that was a
[33:56] man then he could see in that
[34:00] man that it looked like
[34:06] him in another book he
[34:09] says when he approached that
[34:12] man he
[34:16] stopped because coming
[34:19] down he looked at the tree he looked at
[34:23] the
[34:25] animals he went on
[34:28] he could create the
[34:30] tree and carry on but when he after he
[34:34] created the
[34:36] man then he stopped
[34:41] there because when he looked at that
[34:44] man it looked like
[34:52] him if you can walk on the
[34:55] street and Sunday come against somebody
[34:58] who looks like
[35:05] you that's why we couldn't stop
[35:10] anywhere until the seals were
[35:15] open is then we said this is indeed
[35:20] him he is the seals that were revealed
[35:28] he saw in that
[35:31] man that it looked like
[35:34] him when he looked upon
[35:38] him he was a reflection of what his
[35:41] creator
[35:45] was God had now been able to achieve the
[35:50] thing that he wanted he
[35:56] wanted amen In His
[36:03] Image this is your your your your your
[36:06] your last thing
[36:08] here when he
[36:10] says amen amen
[36:14] H in the
[36:17] individual this
[36:19] VES which is seven
[36:22] VES when the Capstone
[36:25] comes the Holy Spirit
[36:28] cements it
[36:33] together meaning that if you have some
[36:38] vges you need the Holy
[36:40] Ghost to cement it
[36:46] together it's so
[36:49] vital there's the baptism of the Holy
[36:53] Spirit the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[36:57] amen amen it is attracted by the VES
[37:01] that are in
[37:06] you amen when Peter found those men with
[37:11] vges natural
[37:14] vges as
[37:17] the
[37:18] um Prophet puts
[37:21] it then he laid hands upon
[37:26] them because Peter has seen that the
[37:31] ground was ready for the Holy
[37:36] Ghost he didn't pray just for
[37:39] anybody but he prayed for
[37:42] those in whom he could see
[37:45] that the ground was ready for the Holy
[37:52] Ghost that's why he couldn't go to
[37:54] hospital and pray lay hands of the
[37:56] people and
[37:59] going on the street saying come come
[38:01] receive the Holy
[38:03] Ghost even the Lord
[38:06] Jesus he couldn't just pour out the Holy
[38:10] Ghost but he he said go and
[38:14] wait to that
[38:17] group the people he has made
[38:21] activated in order for to be prepared
[38:24] for the Holy Ghost
[38:27] because the plant the the seed is
[38:29] planted
