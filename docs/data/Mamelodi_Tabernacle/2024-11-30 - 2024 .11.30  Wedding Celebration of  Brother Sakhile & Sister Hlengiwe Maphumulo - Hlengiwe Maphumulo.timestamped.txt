[50:53] ceremony I'm also greeting every
[50:56] everybody
[50:59] here if there are pastors agree
[51:03] them but let me just say protocol
[51:10] observed um so that no one should say he
[51:15] didn't greet
[51:19] me so I said protocol
[51:25] Ober we are happy to be in
[51:29] this
[51:33] ceremony and we
[51:36] believe God is
[51:40] here I believe is the one who is going
[51:43] to run this
[51:48] ceremony it's not me
[51:52] him if ever I run it according to how he
[51:56] run it
[52:01] before
[52:03] if according to my
[52:07] prophet in ceremonies like these
[52:11] ones my Prophet used not to
[52:18] preach he just came and officiate and
[52:25] live that is what I always
[52:29] do and I'm going to do it even
[52:34] today because my Prophet used to do like
[52:40] that but before I did
[52:45] that I believe my brother
[52:49] here will read me the the
[52:53] Bible as you stand all
[53:00] num
[53:04] chter 21 numbers
[53:09] 21 21 you read from verse 5 to
[53:16] [Music]
[53:19] 10
[53:21] 21 verse 5 and the people speak against
[53:25] God and against Moses wherefore have he
[53:29] brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
[53:33] wilderness for there is no bread neither
[53:36] is there any water and our souls Lo this
[53:41] light and the
[53:44] Lord
[53:47] people
[53:49] [Music]
[53:54] people therefore the people came to
[53:56] Moses and said we have sinned for we
[54:00] have spoken against the Lord and against
[54:02] thee pray unto the Lord that he take
[54:05] away the serpents from us and Moses
[54:08] prayed for the
[54:10] people and the Lord said unto Moses make
[54:13] thee a fairy Serpent and set it upon a
[54:16] pole and it shall come to pass that
[54:19] everyone that is bitten when he look
[54:21] upon it shall live and Moses made a
[54:24] serpent of brass and put it upon a pole
[54:27] and it came to pass that if a serpent
[54:29] had beaten any man when he beheld The
[54:32] Serpent of brass he lived and the
[54:35] children of Israel set forward and
[54:37] pached in
[54:39] [Music]
[54:46] O
[54:50] amen yes
[54:54] Lord hallelujah
[55:05] amen
[55:09] amen yes
[55:15] Lord pray in the precious name of our
[55:19] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen we may
[55:22] take our seats
[55:37] um the incident which happened
[55:43] here I want to compare it with the
[55:46] incident it happened in the
[55:53] beginning because here the Bible say
[55:56] people
[55:57] spoke better about God than
[56:04] [Music]
[56:06] Moses because if you speak better about
[56:09] Moses you speak better about
[56:16] God Moses was the messenger of God for
[56:19] that particular dispensation
[56:25] [Music]
[56:28] by doing that they made God
[56:34] angry and God punished
[56:37] them by S by sending
[56:42] serpent so that those serpent can bite
[56:46] them you see those people of Israel had
[56:54] doctors doctors who could
[56:59] heal different
[57:02] diseases they moved through the
[57:05] Wilderness for several
[57:07] years they moved through the Wilderness
[57:09] for several
[57:13] years I believe they met several snakes
[57:20] there I believe those snakes bite
[57:24] them I believe those doctors killed
[57:27] those
[57:29] [Music]
[57:32] bites when it comes to this
[57:35] one doctors fail to kill
[57:40] that because when they tried to kill
[57:43] this
[57:44] one the snake bite
[57:47] them then they die while they're trying
[57:50] to help
[57:52] somebody there was no one who could help
[57:55] somebody
[57:57] they were all
[58:00] vulnerable in the beginning
[58:03] there when man
[58:06] fell everything
[58:09] fell this what the Bible
[58:11] says nature is
[58:15] groaning because why nature is
[58:19] Gro is groaning because it has fallen
[58:22] from somewhere
[58:26] they have fallen from their original
[58:31] position also marriage
[58:34] fell from the beginning
[58:37] there then we train social
[58:42] workers to try to melt the
[58:46] marriage but when they are
[58:50] trying they also have the problem of
[58:54] marriage then we trade
[58:56] marriage
[58:59] officers we
[59:01] trained marriage
[59:06] officers them also have a marriage
[59:11] problem there is no one who could cure
[59:14] this problem of
[59:16] [Applause]
[59:18] marriage just like
[59:20] there just like in
[59:22] Egypt just like in the wilderness
[59:26] the the the solution for that
[59:32] bite it was the Brazen
[59:37] snake which was placed upon the the
[59:44] pole by
[59:46] Moses and Jesus said as Moses plac the
[59:50] bra serent on a pole
[59:57] the sound of man will be placed like
[1:00:02] that it was for the same
[1:00:06] purpose because that snake
[1:00:09] there it was for the remission of their
[1:00:14] SS and for their
[1:00:16] healing and this one
[1:00:19] also it is for the same
[1:00:22] purpose it's for the remission of our
[1:00:25] sins
[1:00:27] and for healing
[1:00:29] us there is only one solution
[1:00:34] now for
[1:00:36] everything we have
[1:00:39] failed we have tried we have got 10 laws
[1:00:43] of
[1:00:44] marriage 10 laws of
[1:00:49] marriage but those laws have
[1:00:52] failed but there is only one solution
[1:00:58] that is
[1:01:00] Christ amen he's the only one because
[1:01:04] the Bible say in the beginning was the
[1:01:07] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:01:11] Word was God and the way was made flesh
[1:01:15] and those who have received
[1:01:19] it they've G they've been given
[1:01:22] power to become the children of God
[1:01:27] only receiving
[1:01:30] Christ you have a solution for
[1:01:36] marriage that's why the prophet didn't
[1:01:40] preach because when we when we bring
[1:01:44] people to be
[1:01:46] married we believe that they have had
[1:01:49] the
[1:01:50] message because the
[1:01:52] message is Christ amen
[1:01:58] and if you receive
[1:02:02] because if if you you you you identify
[1:02:07] the messenger of your
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:12] age the
[1:02:14] messenger of your age and you recognize
[1:02:18] the message of your
[1:02:22] age and receive it and live by it
[1:02:28] that is the evidence that you have the
[1:02:30] Holy
[1:02:35] Spirit then we believe these
[1:02:39] two they have received the message of
[1:02:42] the
[1:02:44] hour because the message of the hour is
[1:02:48] only is the only solution of
[1:02:54] marriage there is no other
[1:02:57] solution there are
[1:02:59] people who don't receive who say they've
[1:03:02] received the
[1:03:04] message but they have not received
[1:03:06] it because if you have received
[1:03:10] it you will be let me say something like
[1:03:13] this when you fall at the beginning
[1:03:17] there you become you you receive the
[1:03:20] nature of an
[1:03:23] animal any person who is not born
[1:03:27] again he has got the nature of an
[1:03:31] animal that's why they kill one
[1:03:35] another because that nature is the
[1:03:37] nature of
[1:03:39] anyone but to get another
[1:03:43] nature is to be born
[1:03:46] again there is no
[1:03:48] birth birth comes by the
[1:03:51] seat and you must receive the seat to be
[1:03:54] born again
[1:03:57] and the seed is the word of
[1:03:59] God and the word of God moves through
[1:04:02] the
[1:04:05] body that's why the way the
[1:04:09] seat moved through
[1:04:12] philli moved through
[1:04:14] Philip and the UN of
[1:04:19] ethopia then the UN of Ethiopia in order
[1:04:22] to be born
[1:04:24] again he received the
[1:04:28] seat that's why the seat in this
[1:04:32] hour came through our
[1:04:35] prophet and from the prophet it went
[1:04:39] through pastors
[1:04:40] there because there is no any other
[1:04:44] channel that the word of God can
[1:04:48] travel without this
[1:04:51] channel this is the only Channel
[1:04:55] believe I am the part of the
[1:04:59] body which is carrying the
[1:05:01] seat if someone receive the
[1:05:04] SE the birth will be there sorry birth
[1:05:08] will be
[1:05:12] there because birth comes through the
[1:05:16] seat that's why we don't preach this
[1:05:20] ceremonies because we believe these
[1:05:23] ones theyve received the
[1:05:29] because we have baptized them we baptize
[1:05:32] somebody who says I
[1:05:34] believe we can't just baptize
[1:05:37] you tell us you believe the
[1:05:40] message when you believe the message we
[1:05:43] bapti then we believe that you are at
[1:05:46] the place where we
[1:05:48] are you have changed the nature of
[1:05:53] animal you have you have attained
[1:05:55] another the
[1:05:56] nature the nature of God because if you
[1:06:00] got the nature of God you are one with
[1:06:04] God and you and this
[1:06:07] sister if you if if you got the nature
[1:06:10] of God if the sister nature of God then
[1:06:14] you are one there is no need of
[1:06:17] Separation there nothing can separate
[1:06:21] you because you have got one nature that
[1:06:25] is the nature
[1:06:28] of but the problem
[1:06:31] is a
[1:06:34] sister when he see the message he found
[1:06:37] the brother in the message and the
[1:06:40] brother proposed the
[1:06:42] sister because the brother seems to be
[1:06:45] in the
[1:06:48] message only to find that that brother
[1:06:51] is not
[1:06:53] the then he a sheep and a
[1:06:58] lion and you cannot try to advise the
[1:07:01] sheep and the
[1:07:05] lion when you try to advise the
[1:07:09] lion the LI will say
[1:07:12] Amen but he waiting to De the
[1:07:19] Sheep only after some few months you
[1:07:23] hear that they have divorc
[1:07:26] that someone was a
[1:07:29] lion another one was a
[1:07:32] sheep those two Natures cannot
[1:07:37] match or the brother proposing a
[1:07:41] sister thinking that the sister is the
[1:07:44] the child of
[1:07:46] God but the sister is not the child of
[1:07:50] God he was he was just there looking for
[1:07:53] marriage
[1:07:58] after being married
[1:07:59] now her nature
[1:08:04] comes let me stop here stand up you
