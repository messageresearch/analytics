[Music] Amen. Uh actually you are equipped now. H I'm not going to belong here. Nothing can harm her. He's a protector as well. He He protects the bride. Amen. Amen. So will the bride. And he and he will show and she receives it. She never doubts it. She never doubts the word. Nothing can harm her because to harm him is to harm him. The two are the two are one. Nothing can harm me. Not even death. Amen. Not even death. Amen. Amen. That is the wife of life. He makes her a life companion. Amen. Amen. Always come and say viva my wife. Viva my wife. Long life. Long live my wife. Amen. Amen. by putting more pouring himself into her. Glory to God. So the prophet says he poured himself. Amen. Amen. To keep the wife like himself so that they may speak the same language. They may believe the same God. Amen. They may fellowship together. so that they may be harmony. He says he poured himself using the word in Greek kinos kinos pouring out. He poured himself emptied himself into his wife. Amen. Amen. Not a church but the bride. Amen. Isn't he wonderful? What a wonderful husband. Amen. And so will the bride. Nothing can harm me. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. the water of life. Amen. Amen. Amen. Just like a a mama taking care of her flower every morning, the the first thing when she wakes up, she goes to the garden to greet the flowers. How are you? How was the night? Because I understand we as we said this last time, I said something like I I bought some flowers and uh now this the the sales lady there, I said to her, you know, I love this type of a flower, but I had one But uh it's not healthy. Amen. And uh he said to me, "Okay, brother, come here." So I moved closer to her and she says, "Now I want to I want to lecture you on something. [Music] Th this flower, if you buy this flower and you take it to your place, when you reach your place, don't just dig a hole and push it in. You must talk to the flower. First thing you must welcome the flower and say well flower still in a pot now you have arrived this is going to be your new home now. Amen. Amen. My children now this and who and when now you live in this place. There's a dog around here, but don't worry, it will be a friend as well. And and she says, "If then h when the time you you bought the flower, the flower was facing east, make sure that when you reach home, you put it the same way." Amen. Exactly how God placed us. Amen. Amen. The way we were in heaven in the east because he placed the the first man. Amen. Amen. He placed us also here eastward. Now I'm talking about spiritual because east that's where the whole thing began. The Lord shall come from the east. So he has put us spiritually eastward. Because that's how we were positioned in heaven. So if you you you buy the flower from that place facing east. Now you say a flower has no face. It is it has you look at it you can see that it's facing this way. If you don't know what I mean show me your flower. I'll show you. Amen. Amen. Amen. And then he she says, "Then if you dig you dig a hole, you walk around with it. It should be a a a partnership there. It should be there." So you come to a place and I said would you be comfortable here? Amen. Amen. If you say in yourself yes that means that that is the flowers. Yes. Amen. Amen. I'll show you here that God don't just put you anywhere. It's in agreement. For he says, "How can the two walk together?" So before God can put you here, he has to sign an agreement with you. Amen. Amen. So then you put that flower there. Then she says then you'll see the flower. She will enjoy the place and accept the environment. I said I have learned a great lesson today because now me being a pastor. I now apply it spiritually and now I have seen something. Amen. Amen. And I said you are true. You are it's true because God spoke to this flower. [Music] Amen. Amen. And he spoke it into existence. And the prophet of God says then he put some potentials in this flower. And he said to the flower, when you are buried in the ground, you must come forth. Amen. Amen. So springtime comes. We see now a resurrection coming. Amen. Amen. And that's why the power of resurrection is in us already. The Bible say that the spirit of whom that raised Jesus Christ if that spirit is in us the body. Amen. So he has put the potentials in you so that to know how to maneuver and the prophet says and you know what to [Music] do. Amen. Amen. You can't be trapped somewhere. You know what to do. When there's problem coming, you have potential. Amen. You exactly know what to do when the people are breaking [Music] away to do. Amen. Because as child of God, masters all circumstances. Amen. You will never find him cornered somewhere. Always living and always on foot on his feet. Amen. Amen. So his wife is not wanting. She receives all things from him. Amen. Then in closing, the Lord willing, uh here is the secret. Now the weight is in the bride. Here is the the secret is the word is in the bride. That is the the secret. If it's not in the bride, it's not a secret. But it it's a secret when it is in the secret when it was in him. Amen. Amen. And the secret that was in him as the husband, he transferred his mind to the because your wife should know what you your dislikes and the things you like. Otherwise, it will contradict she knows that my husband don't like this. My husband don't eat this. Amen. Amen. My husband don't want this to be done like this. My husband don't My husband likes this. Now the bride of Christ knows very well my husband don't like don't establish denominations that is the wife now my husband don't ordain women pre women women pastors my husband. Amen. Amen. That does the wife. The knowledge of the husband passed on the wife. Now she speaks the same language. My husband won't bless a denomination. So she knows about the husband. That's how there's a harmony because she knows how to to serve her husband. Amen. Now in other words, while the husband knows her wife, the wife knows the husband. Now they can exchange things pleasing one another. I'm talking about Christ and the body. Amen. Amen. A church in harmony with Christ and exchange with Christ. She will never contradict him. He is the head of the body. Amen. Amen. Look what this uh uh uh um uh uh political 50 50/50 has done now50. Look what happened in their homes. Some are breaking and so forth. That is a political 50/50. breaks the harmony. Amen. Uh because now you are reading they say 300 rand for spanking a child breaking the harmony between the parent and the child. You know what is spanking? So now your child now just for doing this mother has beaten me speaking now I don't know what what are they going to do now because when a child is delivered from the mother spanking done on whether they are going to sue the midwife or what? Are they going to sue the midwife that baby? Yeah, these are politics. need a strong con constituency. Hallelujah. They they need a strong constituent. They want to be voted in. If now there's a All right, let me stop there for later. Let me read here. Here is the secret. The word is in the Amen. Not with the bride in the bride because there is some some somewhere where the word is with the people. [Music] The Bible says they were Pharisees and scribes and so forth and the power of God was there to heal them. The power But the power couldn't heal them. Why? Because they didn't believe. But the power was there. Amen. The power is here to heal you. You don't even need to be prayed for. No. The power is here to heal you. But only if you recognize it. I've seen people getting healed in the tabernacle and elsewhere where we went. Amen. Amen. Without this system of laying of hands, I've seen them getting healed. [Music] said, "While the weather was [Music] coming, I felt power in my body and gone was my disease." I I can produce some people to give you a testimony. Amen. Amen. Here is the secret because the word is a healer. You receive the weight, you are healed. Only if you receive the word. That soldier said, "You need not to come to my house. Speak the word." Amen. Just speak the word. And the Lord said, "Even in Israel, I've never seen speak the word." And Peter, he found them there. The whole night trying to catch fish and they caught nothing. And he said to them, they said, "Lord, we tried to draw the whole night." And he said, "Cast your net deep." And Peter said, "We have tried the whole night, but by your word, we will do it according to your word." So they cast their nets and they draw many fish. Even the the nets break. Amen. They broke because that was they've done it in his word. [Music] If you want to go some places in God. Amen. Amen. And your pocket will your purse will never go dry as long as you do it. As long as it's for him, Amen. you you keep that in your heart. Give Elijah said, "Amen." Amen. And she had the last two But the prophet came and said, "Give it to me first." Give it to God first. Amen. Amen. And all these other things shall be added unto you. Give it to God first. Here is the secret. The word is in the bride. And the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word. Now listen carefully. The word here is the secret. You know Mary had the secret. And there were critics around that secret. [Applause] You see now, did you hear of any wedding? But look at her. God just kept there's a man. He came to my house with another pastor. is a pastor. So um we were speaking on terms of ordaining women and that and that. So he was so furious because he has done it already. He's known in the cycles. He has pastor Selena there. [Music] there. So now he was in in trouble trying to sell that to me. So I said, "Uh uh pastor, give me a scripture I can a scripture that I can use when ordaining a sister for our pastorship." Then he said, "You see in the old Jewish culture." So I said, "No, no, no, pastor. I am a common believer. I'm not used to those Jewish culture. I'm just a common believer. Show me in the Bible. then I will do it and [Music]
