[1:10:58] amen we may just take our
[1:11:05] seats God bless each and every one of
[1:11:11] you um I'm just going to talk with
[1:11:18] you going to talk about hearing his
[1:11:21] voice today
[1:11:30] the word of God the Bible says is a
[1:11:38] seat the seat we
[1:11:42] know has got
[1:11:47] stages start with being a
[1:11:51] seat and we know if you have got a seat
[1:11:54] in your
[1:11:59] you have got everything in
[1:12:03] there in that City there are
[1:12:08] Roots
[1:12:13] St
[1:12:23] branches flower
[1:12:28] fruits
[1:12:30] seeds but you can't see
[1:12:33] them but they are
[1:12:36] there even if you can break the
[1:12:40] seat you can see those
[1:12:44] things but if you want to see
[1:12:47] them just put the
[1:12:50] seed prepared soil
[1:12:55] then those things will just
[1:12:58] come it will never need your
[1:13:03] prayer but if you place them in the
[1:13:10] good in the good
[1:13:14] condition those things will just
[1:13:16] come
[1:13:19] hallu they
[1:13:20] it has got those stages
[1:13:25] must thing the
[1:13:31] Le and if you destroy
[1:13:36] the you destroy the
[1:13:40] seat then it will move from
[1:13:43] there to a
[1:13:47] stock then it will move from there to
[1:13:51] the sh
[1:13:55] and from the
[1:13:57] shock it will go back to the
[1:14:02] SE then you must know those
[1:14:06] stages and if the word of God is a
[1:14:10] seat it must also have
[1:14:15] stages and you and I we must know what
[1:14:20] stage is the word of God now
[1:14:29] because there were two
[1:14:32] kings it was Ahab and
[1:14:36] Jehosaphat Jehosaphat visited
[1:14:41] Ahab when they were there I believe they
[1:14:45] were
[1:14:46] talking they were talking about their
[1:14:49] God they talking about their
[1:14:53] Journey how they moved from from Egypt
[1:14:55] to where they
[1:14:58] are helped
[1:15:00] them and they start to talk
[1:15:07] about said let's just
[1:15:12] take because it is
[1:15:15] ours is part of the promise of
[1:15:19] God he was
[1:15:22] right but the timing of that
[1:15:26] it was
[1:15:29] that there was a man of God
[1:15:33] there which was
[1:15:35] jehos he said well we can take
[1:15:38] it but let's hear what God is saying
[1:15:41] about it
[1:15:45] today he was
[1:15:49] aware that the word of God has
[1:15:52] [Music]
[1:15:53] stages we must know where the word of
[1:15:56] God
[1:15:59] is
[1:16:01] today we must just be
[1:16:06] worshipers but you must
[1:16:09] know where the word of
[1:16:13] is but when in
[1:16:17] joh Jesus says
[1:16:20] here my
[1:16:22] sheep hear my voice
[1:16:26] and they follow
[1:16:28] me in the Old
[1:16:32] Testament because when Jesus was
[1:16:36] preaching always when he gives
[1:16:40] Parables when he was
[1:16:43] giving he was talking to the
[1:16:46] Jews he was talking to the people who
[1:16:49] knew those
[1:16:55] because when
[1:16:57] he the kingdom of God is like a
[1:17:01] king has made a A Feast for his
[1:17:08] son then he sent people to go and invite
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:15] people
[1:17:17] Messengers to go and invite
[1:17:20] people to
[1:17:22] come we read this day
[1:17:25] we read the word
[1:17:27] there but those who are from those
[1:17:33] people they know how marriages were
[1:17:36] arranging those
[1:17:40] days they know that the
[1:17:43] owner is the one who must take out
[1:17:50] invitation he must take he must know the
[1:17:52] number of people is inv
[1:17:58] then that's why they didn't wonder when
[1:18:02] Jesus
[1:18:04] said there was someone there who hasn't
[1:18:07] got an waiting
[1:18:11] G that person was taken
[1:18:14] out they didn't say why did they take
[1:18:17] this one
[1:18:19] out because he was C in in the road
[1:18:22] there
[1:18:25] because he was called
[1:18:30] unaware they knew that at the door
[1:18:34] there there was waiting
[1:18:38] G you get through the door you will get
[1:18:42] them but when he was talking with these
[1:18:45] people with the
[1:18:47] sheep and he say my
[1:18:50] sh no he he was talking about them
[1:18:56] they
[1:18:57] know how the owner of the ship
[1:19:04] does they knew that the owner of the
[1:19:08] ship had to go
[1:19:11] out to look for a good
[1:19:17] person who would come and look after his
[1:19:20] sheep
[1:19:25] those ship must grow under his to the
[1:19:33] ship they must be they must know his
[1:19:39] voice they must grow learing under his
[1:19:43] [Music]
[1:19:45] words when they were branding the
[1:19:49] ship they were bring the the Shepherd in
[1:19:53] the hand
[1:20:00] which is on the
[1:20:03] ship it was in the shepherd's
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:08] hand when he look at
[1:20:11] his you see the number which is on the
[1:20:16] [Music]
[1:20:17] ship that's why he says even if the
[1:20:21] mother of a
[1:20:23] child can
[1:20:25] forget
[1:20:27] baby I will never forget
[1:20:31] you because you are in my
[1:20:35] hand he is he is also
[1:20:39] mared with the
[1:20:42] Sheep he was part of the
[1:20:45] ship that's why he says it was
[1:20:50] impossible that the Sheep could not hear
[1:20:55] the voice of the
[1:20:57] shepherd because it has grown under his
[1:21:04] true Jesus
[1:21:06] said those who have
[1:21:09] had those who have
[1:21:12] leared from the father they will come to
[1:21:16] me because they have grown
[1:21:22] under his father that is how the Sheep
[1:21:26] were done in those
[1:21:30] days is saying here my
[1:21:34] sh he my
[1:21:37] voice it is no it is under no cumstances
[1:21:43] where the Sheep where his sheep would
[1:21:45] not
[1:21:48] share his
[1:21:52] voice if if it is of his
[1:21:59] ship it will hear his
[1:22:02] voice the prophet
[1:22:04] says if it was his voice
[1:22:08] [Music]
[1:22:10] then it is it will be his voice even
[1:22:18] now let me just read
[1:22:22] something amen
[1:22:24] I want to read for you
[1:22:27] here he says in this
[1:22:30] book what has he
[1:22:33] done he he has placed with them a true
[1:22:44] teacher
[1:22:47] Prophet St with the
[1:22:50] word the Bible my sheep hear my
[1:22:56] voice said
[1:22:58] Jesus if that was his voice
[1:23:03] then it is his voice
[1:23:06] now anything contrary to that

[1:23:18] foot and they won't follow
[1:23:23] iten if it is his words
[1:23:26] then it is his words
[1:23:33] today
[1:23:34] if the ship followed the voice
[1:23:39] then the Sheep will follow the voice
[1:23:47] today the prophet
[1:23:51] says his voice
[1:23:55] is his
[1:23:56] [Music]
[1:24:00] weight and in this book did
[1:24:05] not he says his
[1:24:08] voice
[1:24:10] is
[1:24:12] is is God's word in a letter
[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:18] form am
[1:24:21] am he says the Bible is the voice of
[1:24:32] in other words the word of
[1:24:34] God the
[1:24:36] Bible is the voice of
[1:24:40] God in a
[1:24:44] for the she of
[1:24:47] God it will
[1:24:50] follow the word of God which is the
[1:24:53] Bible
[1:24:57] amen the prophet
[1:24:59] says
[1:25:01] I with those who follow
[1:25:04] me the Bible is our
[1:25:10] ultimate in other words they cannot go
[1:25:16] over they cannot go
[1:25:19] under the B is theultimate
[1:25:26] only the
[1:25:28] ship can
[1:25:31] hear and
[1:25:34] understand not
[1:25:38] [Music]
[1:25:39] all let me read something
[1:25:43] here for
[1:25:46] you and for
[1:25:50] me the word of God
[1:25:53] says in this
[1:25:56] book I sincerely believe that the spirit
[1:26:00] of God has been speaking to
[1:26:07] us not only teaching us the
[1:26:12] truth of the
[1:26:14] age but he has been Faithfully dealing
[1:26:18] with
[1:26:24] they may turn to
[1:26:28] him because that is the
[1:26:31] reason that is the reason for all
[1:26:36] preaching and
[1:26:38] teaching for it is in the
[1:26:41] preaching and teaching of the word of
[1:26:46] God that the sheep hear the voice of
[1:26:51] God and follow him
[1:26:54] amen can I
[1:26:57] repeat for it is in the
[1:27:01] preaching and teaching the
[1:27:05] way that the
[1:27:09] Sheep here the voice of
[1:27:15] God
[1:27:17] Amen for the ship to
[1:27:20] hear there must be teaching and
[1:27:22] preaching
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:27] of the word of
[1:27:29] God for the sheep to
[1:27:34] follow it's not for the ship to
[1:27:38] follow it's not for miracles and what
[1:27:44] what it's not for all night prayer and
[1:27:52] fasting those are not for sheep
[1:27:57] for the for the
[1:27:58] ship to
[1:28:00] follow there must be teaching and
[1:28:05] preaching not only teaching and
[1:28:09] preaching but teaching and preaching of
[1:28:11] the way
[1:28:15] of that is when the Sheep will open the
[1:28:22] Earth amen
[1:28:25] because that is where the voice of God
[1:28:30] comes he says here it is in the
[1:28:35] preaching and teaching of the
[1:28:38] way that the sheep hear the
[1:28:41] voice of the voice of God and
[1:28:48] follow are you together with
[1:28:50] us we are building something
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:03] when the genine fored Son of
[1:29:11] God here is the word of
[1:29:16] God but let me start to read from here
[1:29:21] first so has God in every
[1:29:28] age ordained his church for that
[1:29:33] age a message for
[1:29:37] thate I said when I started the word of
[1:29:42] God is a
[1:29:43] SE and a SE
[1:29:47] stages that is why the prophet says here
[1:29:51] so God in every age
[1:29:56] ordained his church for that
[1:29:59] [Music]
[1:30:01] age when God
[1:30:04] sent
[1:30:08] Paul there was ordained pastors under
[1:30:15] him they were ordained
[1:30:18] [Music]
[1:30:20] members under those pastors
[1:30:25] there were
[1:30:29] sheep there were shepherds
[1:30:32] there there were sheep there because
[1:30:36] Paul addressed the
[1:30:40] Shepherds when he was giving them a
[1:30:42] farewell
[1:30:45] speech in each
[1:30:48] age
[1:30:49] [Music]
[1:30:50] ordained that there must be
[1:30:54] a
[1:30:55] messenger it is ordained
[1:30:59] there and there must be
[1:31:03] Shepherds it is ordained
[1:31:06] there there must be
[1:31:08] sh it is ordained
[1:31:11] there knew that Satan will be
[1:31:15] there but he
[1:31:18] Ed that there must be
[1:31:22] Shi and those sh will
[1:31:25] hear because in every
[1:31:28] age we hear this
[1:31:31] way this
[1:31:34] phrase saying he that
[1:31:38] ear let him
[1:31:40] hear because in every age the holy
[1:31:44] spirit is
[1:31:46] speaking the holy spirit is
[1:31:49] teaching and if the holy spirit is
[1:31:52] teaching
[1:31:54] teaching through the
[1:31:58] shepherd through the Shepherd in this A
[1:32:01] in that
[1:32:02] age when when the the holy spirit is
[1:32:07] teaching when the Holy Spirit is
[1:32:10] speaking it
[1:32:12] means it is it is the voice of
[1:32:16] God for that particular
[1:32:21] age and the voice can't be there
[1:32:25] there is there is there is neither no
[1:32:28] one who has got an
[1:32:34] ear is
[1:32:36] heing here because you are born to
[1:32:41] here in each
[1:32:44] age is addressing a
[1:32:51] particular addressing all
[1:32:53] [Music]
[1:32:59] even even if this ways goes all to
[1:33:03] all but but it is not all who will
[1:33:07] receive
[1:33:10] it only a particular class of
[1:33:15] people and those particular class of
[1:33:18] people is those who have got an ability
[1:33:24] to hear the word of because when it says
[1:33:27] he that had an
[1:33:29] ear it means he that had an
[1:33:34] ability and he that had an
[1:33:37] ability that ability is not from
[1:33:40] him he is given that
[1:33:44] ability he is born with that
[1:33:47] ability because the prophet said you are
[1:33:51] born with a stone
[1:33:53] [Applause]
[1:34:00] Amen Let
[1:34:03] me but when that hour
[1:34:07] comes the holy spirit of
[1:34:10] God which was at the
[1:34:14] beginning spoke
[1:34:18] out message
[1:34:23] that Spirit hands that
[1:34:30] egg and when he hears that
[1:34:34] message then is not church denomination
[1:34:38] going to hold
[1:34:43] it it will rise to the
[1:34:48] heights you see he is typing this with
[1:34:50] anlet
[1:34:54] say in HH there is a voice
[1:34:59] coming the voice of the
[1:35:03] mother and the
[1:35:07] there will it will be the ones that will
[1:35:09] hear that
[1:35:12] voice and not any other thing
[1:35:15] there but the
[1:35:19] [Music]
[1:35:21] the in every there is
[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:28] someone my sister and my
[1:35:30] brother let me say to you this is a
[1:35:34] Godly fear knowing that I may never live
[1:35:37] to see an Easter
[1:35:43] gate but there is one thing
[1:35:48] sure when a genine for ordained Son of
[1:35:52] God
[1:35:57] by the word of
[1:35:58] God he that voice of
[1:36:01] God he will
[1:36:03] rise and go to meet
[1:36:07] it it is the
[1:36:11] potential that is going to meet the real
[1:36:14] living
[1:36:17] way in other words he has got the
[1:36:22] potential that is going to one day he
[1:36:26] going to the real living
[1:36:28] way when he
[1:36:30] comes this one because he has got the
[1:36:34] potential he will go and meet that
[1:36:41] one it is that is going to meet the real
[1:36:45] living
[1:36:49] weight the bride will meet the groom
[1:36:54] she is part of this
[1:36:59] body
[1:37:01] amen a genuine forain son or daughter of
[1:37:09] God by the word of
[1:37:11] God when he hear that
[1:37:14] voice for his
[1:37:20] age it must be for his age
[1:37:25] not for the past
[1:37:27] age but for his
[1:37:32] age
[1:37:34] because he or she will know
[1:37:40] it for the preaching and
[1:37:45] teaching is is for the
[1:37:50] Sheep to hear the voice of God
[1:37:54] because it is by preaching and
[1:37:59] teaching who must
[1:38:02] preach
[1:38:09] mustach that is what the that is what
[1:38:12] the let's he what the let let the
[1:38:14] prophet tell us
[1:38:24] he says now God could have chose to
[1:38:27] preach the gospel by the
[1:38:33] son or the
[1:38:36] moon or by the
[1:38:38] stars or by the
[1:38:40] winds or by
[1:38:42] nature but he choose
[1:38:45] M to P the
[1:38:49] gospel and that is where the voice of
[1:38:53] God will
[1:38:57] come if it was the voice of God
[1:39:01] then it is the words of
[1:39:06] God because he chose
[1:39:10] made after he said my sheep hear my
[1:39:15] voice he said if they receive you they
[1:39:20] receive me if they hear you they
[1:39:25] me as the father sent

[1:39:42] sent when his father
[1:39:44] sent he
[1:39:46] came and dwell
[1:39:49] inside it means if he sent me
[1:39:53] must come and
[1:39:59] inside he choose
[1:40:02] me to preach the
[1:40:04] gospel that is where the voice of what

[2:18:18] sons Moses had three
[2:18:21] [Music]
[2:18:27] are you
[2:18:28] together Jesus had three
[2:18:35] signs
[2:18:37] three when God gave
[2:18:41] Moses he gave him three
[2:18:44] signs and he said if they don't listen
[2:18:49] to The First
[2:18:51] [Music]

[2:19:19] the doesn't have
[2:19:22] just

[2:19:30] first was
[2:19:33] healing and the second was
[2:19:36] discernment they were dealing with
[2:19:41] men but when it come to the
[2:19:44] F with
[2:19:46] Jesus they said he went to preach
[2:19:51] but not dealing with
[2:19:54] men that's why the third one in
[2:19:59] Egypt doesn't have a
[2:20:05] voice the B doesn't say if they don't
[2:20:08] hear the
[2:20:10] second the voice of the

[2:21:15] the
[2:21:17] immedi you better hold it by the neck
[2:21:21] but not by the T but God
[2:21:25] saides hold it by the
[2:21:28] T you see it needs Faith
[2:21:32] there it needs Faith to the one who's
[2:21:35] talking to

[2:21:42] you take the snake by the T
[2:21:47] [Applause]

[2:22:46] scent and throw it up
[2:22:50] and he tend him to
[2:22:53] F

[2:25:18] unto the spirits in praon
[2:25:23] and then second Peter start from
[2:25:27] 18 18 for Christ also hath once suffered

[2:25:35] might bring unto us to God being put to
[2:25:39] death in the flesh but quickened by the
[2:25:42] Spirit by which also he went and
[2:25:45] preached unto the spirits in prison you

[2:26:57] believe during Noah's
[2:26:59] time who are those
[2:27:03] Souls so let me just because I'm
[2:27:06] skipping some of the
[2:27:07] things so these
[2:27:10] Spirits these
[2:27:12] angels that
[2:27:14] preached was in
[2:27:17] prison
[2:27:18] Angels if you notice it here is a little
[2:27:24] a which means
[2:27:27] men Angels Messengers here on the
[2:27:33] earth they
[2:27:35] sinned and the only way that they could
[2:27:40] sin would be
[2:27:43] [Music]
[2:27:44] disbelief and they they had their own
[2:27:47] religion
[2:27:50] and they did not believe the message of
[2:27:55] Noah there were preachers
[2:27:58] there these were
[2:28:01] preachers they were
[2:28:03] Messengers during time they were
[2:28:06] preaching there against what Noah is
[2:28:10] preaching they disbel Noah's
[2:28:14] message then they were in
[2:28:18] prison you see the thir tool of Noah's
[2:28:24] message it is when he was preaching to
[2:28:29] them he was preaching in the in the
[2:28:35] ark that is the
[2:28:37] third he was preaching to the souls that
[2:28:40] will never
[2:28:43] repent that is
[2:28:48] of and lot that
[2:28:52] is the third
[2:28:55] man are you together because the first
[2:28:58] one the first
[2:29:00] pool is lot and the second pool is two
[2:29:07] MERS and the third one is the one was
[2:29:10] with
[2:29:12] Abraham is the
[2:29:15] thir in
[2:29:18] s because he the last want to go
[2:29:22] there when he went
[2:29:24] there after
[2:29:30] that he preached to the souls that will
[2:29:33] never
[2:29:37] repent
[2:29:41] pool now he says if the the third
[2:29:47] pool of Jesus Christ was to preach to
[2:29:51] the soul that will never
[2:29:55] repent what about
[2:30:00] now the
[2:30:02] fa because if you can read it there it
[2:30:07] will say the third pool was was when he
[2:30:10] received the
[2:30:13] S because those and it will say again
[2:30:17] the thir are those angels
[2:30:21] it will say again the thir is the
[2:30:24] revelation of the
[2:30:27] seals that is what he would say where
[2:30:30] did where did he get the
[2:30:32] seals in the Pyramid of those
[2:30:35] angels because now he has
[2:30:40] left he has left another
[2:30:43] part he has taken
[2:30:46] another now the preaching is has changed
[2:30:51] is no more helping
[2:30:59] people are you together with
[2:31:02] me that's why
[2:31:04] now the
[2:31:06] message is is preaching to the
[2:31:12] lost that is the thir
[2:31:15] po amen if Jesus preached to their lost
[2:31:21] he is the same
[2:31:24] Jesus who is revealed in our
[2:31:28] day that it must do the
[2:31:34] same
[2:31:37] amen together with
[2:31:39] me beautiful he is preaching to the
[2:31:45] spirits that's why now
[2:31:50] when the pastor
[2:31:51] here tend to preach this
[2:31:55] message some people
[2:31:59] away because now it has when when Moses
[2:32:05] throw the stick
[2:32:06] down people could understand when he put
[2:32:11] his there people could
[2:32:14] understand but when he started the third
[2:32:18] one people could
[2:32:21] understand when no was preaching there
[2:32:26] the ark people were there they had
[2:32:30] chance but when he was in the
[2:32:33] ark they had no chance
[2:32:37] now amen now this
[2:32:41] ministry we
[2:32:46] have has passed
[2:32:50] H it's only it is judgment to
[2:32:57] others but it could it is it is for the
[2:33:02] bride because it said the thir pool will
[2:33:06] catch
[2:33:08] it catch what big
[2:33:13] fish not these small
[2:33:17] pools they catch small fish
[2:33:21] because people like
[2:33:25] Miracles it catches
[2:33:27] people but when you get to
[2:33:30] the it catch
[2:33:33] only the big
[2:33:37] [Applause]
[2:33:42] fish I said them skiing many
[2:33:45] things this is for the bride
[2:33:51] they
[2:33:52] said those
[2:33:54] angels came with the salt this Sal came
[2:33:57] with the
[2:34:00] angel they give it to the
[2:34:04] prophet and he said God help
[2:34:07] me take this
[2:34:09] thought and go
[2:34:12] through the tree of
[2:34:16] life it was the
[2:34:18] revelation of the word of
[2:34:21] God it was a Ministry
[2:34:24] higher but for the
[2:34:26] bride but for the others it is Judgment
[2:34:31] it has passed they will never hear
[2:34:34] it even if they try it will never help
[2:34:38] them because it's for the people who are
[2:34:44] outside it is not for them the is not
[2:34:47] for them
