Description:
This message was preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 12 February 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle in South Africa

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the word that God spoke and the manifestation of it. The Pastor read Exodus 20: 20  “And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. He shows that God spoke to Moses from heaven. We need to hear the word from heaven and not from the puilpit. We can only hear the word from heaven if we are the place of the word, and if we are the place of the word it will prosper in us.”

He further reads Isaiah 55: 11  “So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.”

Our preaching is for the prosperity of the word. The three wise men from the east were a place of the sign of his birth. And Mary brought the word down. Like sister Hattie brought the third pull down.
The word that God spoke will never miss a target.

He also refer to the Spoken Word book of 64-0816 -  Proving His Word “And the Son of man is revealing Himself in the same power that He was, (not down through the church age, through justification, sanctification, all these things here) but the Son of man. Who is the Son of man? The Word!

it it couldn't find a place to land on the way that God pasta God the Creator he spoke but that way could not find a place finally this word caught into the womb of a vision yeah meaning this word couldn't find a place amen amen it was coming from God but then according to the word yes before God you can or can utter or could speak anyway he must have first a field a place that's why the prophet speaks of the word that was spoken what happens if God speaks say Let There be lights and there was light wow now we call it the spoken word we call it the spoken words now every spoken word must have a manifestation right but spoken because he says come to Moses I want the people to know that I talked with you I talked with you Moses amen okay I mean now there's so many pulpits today

please um right now listen to this one yeah look away look away to Jesus to Jesus now I've got two books here yeah Moses he says let these people know foreign I know people are going from this people to that part right but the weight is not from the pulpit the word should come from God everybody can read their spoken right and stand up and say I am recite the things foreign where there was no [Music] um my book let me find you then it says here sister sister are nothing but the truth some who were there were thinking about it we have never seen squirrels around here but sister sister said brother nothing but the truth now John did you hear what the prophet said if I can find this book what he has said to him I am much said okay let me cook it foreign did not say it from here if if it's not from here then he says God spoke out of him Peter Pedro the Lord Jesus said what do men say I the son of man amen they say some say married and they turned to the classes because there's always a class among the people there's a prophetic classroom now we turn to the prophetic classes if the people say I'm this is okay I the son of man and Peter said Thou Art the Christ oh Christ he didn't say thou art Jesus because Jesus he was called Jesus but Peter said I'm in that's why you look at the predestinated seats is the mystery of God it can't say Jesus Christ [Applause] foreign way now that is three four okay you are part of that freeform that's why when the seventh is revealed it is it is like a lightning they're all three foods what is three foreign let's go back to you the beginning is God logos logos amen that is amen and Jesus reminded them you shall know I know I know that I'm part of the three four yeah the seventh sillies [Music] that I am in the father you are holding the third position [Applause] so the whole thing is open in the it is thank you so part of the three four it is open in me as part of the threefolds all right yeah yeah you know I was reading even something and it didn't puzzle me but let me read it to you the same thing you're not about you you know this message is not just a letter yeah this is something here and and the son of man that is proving his words and the son of man is revealing himself in the same power that he was not down through the churches through justification but the son of man then he says who is the son of man you know we are so blessed three sure even to know who who you can preach we are the son of name right amen who is the son of man the word right while I see you have a dizzy a bit let me look into this let's say who is the son of man it comes in stages he was the son of man when he was here called the son of man Prophet prophet but proving his words the son of man who is the son of man now now you are going to say oh Lord to go back and say it's Jesus teaches the prophet the son of man here now you know that the book says the message of the Seven Seals in their closing that's the message of the entire Bible the seven series I mean [Applause] now what will happen to you if the New Testament is because the servants is beyond all this testimonies let us let us read this you know I can read the books prophecies but Philip but failing to bring about the manifestation the prophet said amen amen it is like applying the word if you believe you are healed that's why somebody who believes can just touch you and but this touch has to find something in you a Chinese so if this that faith in you like that woman she came from Beyond foreign is that so no she didn't only say that she started me with the atoma towards the hand and Thomas you could see him pushing the people because there was a pool she has already said it look it's pulling yeah you look at Moses with a stick at swearing partner he conquered Egypt amen he never thought of a big army to attack ages and he made him God for God to make you God that's when he has that trusting [Applause] when God believes in you he makes you a god amen amen and the Bible says he came from behind foreign all right amen as I went to preach that sister sorry I went to preach to pray for that City when I started take it home it was already done the only thing was to touch him but it is already done I don't know whether you understand [Applause] right now this is puzzling the son of man they wait the son of man who is the son of man who's going to believe it amen okay now he comes whether you Christa he changes from being jealous amen amen next time he is Jesus the Christ taking forms amen but the principal fella is the way taking some forms and then let's say it says the son of man is the way let me see if if I can find this foreign the son of man now when she believed what the prophet same propheter said to her I said she said we are nothing so but the truth now you see different people yes he says or and she was she said this not from here because from here you will if you are from here you will see I have never seen a squirrel well somebody's listening remote it says she was out no not she she say it she was off amen of the things [Music] amen now she has hid the word not from here all the things now when brother Brenham spoke he spoke to her not from here the way it was not from here that's why she said nothing but the truth somebody could have said um what truth have you ever seen a squirrel when you say it's the truth is the truth he's left all right and then he said she did not say it from here then here is another thing the next thing what did he say she didn't say it from from here God spoke from a heart amen because from here you can't believe this is from where it is coming from now from where it is coming from is coming from the Creator now coming from the creation you see the difference all things are possible because if they even if there's no Square in here it says a creation amen now creation is from God that's why the faith what sister Hadi said said Sister Sister was from not from was not from here foreign foreign what did he call it we are the Third pool I mean so meaning that the third pool where is it today in the bride for the first pool for the first time the first pool upon a human being was a little humble woman sister Cocoa Beach for the llama first time at all the first time it was manifested it was not just a preaching your teaching now with this one it was a manifestation you know we are reading things from the spoken words but sometimes we are not seeing them of those things but everything that was spoken you must be manifested amen amen God must be manifested in you the seventh seal must be manifested amen now this is manifested for the first time [Music] in a human being meaning that that this it's like this everyone knows um I believe I'm preaching everyone knows as certain as the face was identified so was the second identifier and if you think really close here is him that has wisdom is properly identity we know where it is [Applause] [Music] all right I mean that's why here it is manifested in Sisterhood because it is [Music] now if you are part of The Three Families that pool is here the seventh seal is revealed only to death okay otherwise it is um oh I don't know where is my my okay amen before we close the third pool this way if oh yeah now surely end it speaks for itself okay [Applause] sister Sisterhood here's the third pool speaking for itself [Applause] then he comes there and say this will be a thing that will start the rapture [Music] yes then he says about the thing that is coming it has started now foreign foreign now we beseech your brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by way nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that men of sin be revealed the son of petition amen who opposeth an exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worship so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself is it not happening

yeah like yeah you listen here not Son of God Son of fella Muramoto what's this book almighty God unless the Mighty God unveiled before us and in Genesis 18. 18. God was a man standing there eating and talking with Abraham and told what Sarah was doing in the tent behind and Jesus said to us in the days I mean they're coming over there the son of man amen look it doesn't say the son of God I think you know the difference the deity failed again in human flesh remember Jesus didn't say when the Son of God is being revealed in Luke 17 more Luke 17 when the son of man is being revealed amen what is the son of man now when it is now the son of man back in in the church again amen huh all right again revealed in human beings because the son of man is when it is manifested before it was manifested it was Jesus even the prophet came amen but he is no longer here now what is remaining is the Revelation amen now we are told the son of man we can't say there was a son of man here now he's gone speech it was one Adam everyone son of man they're plural amen because the son of man means not the Son of God I'm not saying all right let's reach it the son of man again in human beings tool I'm in yeah yeah when the before the Rapture comes really hard we have to see this is because it should be the Revelation in human beings you know we are getting together now one is Florida huh amen one in Australia one in Congo Congo we are now getting together we are coming together for the meeting in there amen amen now listen get a challenge that's why my

talking about Brandon again he was talking about the body of Christ amen you are not predestinated if you are residing there America did you know that now what about you yeah well in education they will tell you that for to obtain a better education you go to Australia Australia [Music] all right now the son of man you are the moromotive back in the church now I'm telling the church revealed in human beings you refer to the prophet as the son of man but now it is not longer brother the son of man in the entire place amen amen not a Son of God the son fella of men again happy I will in his church again and now the glory of God is behind your skin amen and because the glory of God was behind the skin it is now behind your skin not only referring to one man as the son of man change we chase the son of man that is the way the weight was in the Sun the weight is now in the Sun [Applause] you see the difference the son of man Muramoto now that's why the third pool it's not a teaching
