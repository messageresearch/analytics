[33:27] I also heard it is this you'll realize
[33:30] when we come with it next
[33:32] time that it is not something to
[33:36] preach but the the Bible says when he
[33:41] opened not when he
[33:44] preached amen amen
[33:47] because
[33:50] um when he
[33:53] opened when he
[33:55] opened
[33:58] and I what happened when he
[34:04] opened let's read
[34:07] brother and uh before we read we have
[34:12] our Elder
[34:15] here our
[34:19] Elder to just say a word of
[34:23] prayer to our most holy God
[34:32] we are here this morning
[34:34] amen let us
[34:37] pray gracious
[34:40] Lord before we read the
[34:44] scripture we Commit This Moment unto
[34:47] that's
[34:48] right a moment
[34:51] father where your presence is now in we
[34:56] used to say amen Israelites were in the
[34:59] Old
[35:00] Testament you were far in the clouds
[35:03] Lord Almighty they will see a pillar of
[35:07] fire and they will see a cloud amen and
[35:11] you came into the temple in
[35:14] Jerusalem they could not go into the
[35:16] holy of
[35:18] holies but father when the seals were
[35:22] opened father you came into the into our
[35:25] hearts yes and come Lord Almighty and S
[35:29] with
[35:29] us now Lord Almighty you are the one
[35:32] that is doing everything in the olden
[35:35] days it used to be the angel of the
[35:39] Lord uh encountering and doing
[35:43] everything but that angel now Lord
[35:46] Almighty is a an amature God gracious
[35:51] Lord even this very morning Lord we pray
[35:55] as the pastor stands here yes let anoint
[35:58] him Lord Almighty Inspire Him Father
[36:01] with that very same anointing brother
[36:04] Bram head when the
[36:07] Angels came and picked him up there's an
[36:11] angel that flew into him father then
[36:15] that angel commune with him and that
[36:19] very same Angel is the one that will
[36:21] commune with your servants today and it
[36:23] will commune with us the bride take
[36:27] control father of the
[36:29] situation that is the very thing that
[36:31] the devil doesn't want the devil doesn't
[36:34] want to see the bride
[36:37] seeing what he is because that makes him
[36:40] an
[36:41] amateure so then that devil will bind
[36:44] him with a mighty name Lord because it's
[36:47] a Divine name he has no power that is
[36:51] why he comes in different forms but
[36:54] rather he's too late because C the seals
[36:59] and the thir pool has been revealed Lord
[37:03] father thank you we pray in the name of
[37:06] our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen
[37:12] amen all right you may be seated God
[37:16] bless
[37:20] you can read oh sir God bless you sir
[37:24] amen Revelation chapter 8
[37:27] verse
[37:28] one and when he had opened the seventh
[37:31] seal there was silence in heaven about
[37:34] the space of half an
[37:41] hour you may be
[37:49] seated I just wanted that part when he
[37:55] op
[38:00] you don't find in the
[38:03] Bible where the seventh seal was
[38:09] preached but we find only
[38:12] where he
[38:16] opened amen amen I think it's
[38:21] something you are looking
[38:25] at
[38:28] you remember how he said to
[38:33] John come
[38:36] up and I will show
[38:38] you things to
[38:42] come
[38:45] meaning John could not see those
[38:51] things he could only see them
[38:55] after was summoned
[38:59] up then brother B puts it puts it in
[39:03] this
[39:05] way that he
[39:08] says from
[39:10] there he was
[39:13] lifted from the church ages chur amen
[39:18] meaning he left this
[39:22] church at the end of the church AG
[39:25] Church
[39:27] in that
[39:29] Vision John was someone to come
[39:34] up in order to
[39:38] see beyond the church
[39:42] ages supposed to come
[39:47] up it is like that in the
[39:50] Bible for you to see
[39:55] further
[39:59] God has to put you in a
[40:03] position so that you can see
[40:09] now our
[40:12] vision it's not just to look at one
[40:15] thing like this no our
[40:19] because it is in a cycle of
[40:25] Eternity like when brother one day
[40:32] said us
[40:35] go the
[40:38] of amen amen
[40:42] and that's why we are going to see that
[40:47] today it is
[40:51] beyond our preaching
[40:55] season when brother bam met the seventh
[41:01] angel so it changed to something
[41:08] else now you must
[41:10] remember we are talking about the seven
[41:13] Church
[41:14] ages
[41:16] Church seven Church
[41:20] ages amen amen
[41:24] but you don't have the rest
[41:29] of this is we are only in the
[41:35] seventh where is the other
[41:37] part in the sixth
[41:42] Dimension they Beyond in the sixth
[41:46] Dimension but every
[41:48] time we hear
[41:51] preaching the seven Church ages Church
[41:55] yes part of it is is not
[42:00] visible is that right amen and
[42:05] now because is the time
[42:09] now for the
[42:13] bride which it is the
[42:16] part that is invisible to some
[42:24] people another thing let me
[42:27] say
[42:29] um the bride is not
[42:35] churches brother
[42:38] says
[42:42] the has been taken out of the churches
[42:46] amen that's why in your
[42:53] Bible Overcomers there is those who are
[42:56] are
[42:57] called each and
[42:59] every Church age Church
[43:03] age H it it had
[43:07] two twis twins
[43:13] twins then you can hear as you you you
[43:16] you go down
[43:19] reading it
[43:21] says uh in every Church age it has what
[43:28] it's called
[43:33] Overcomers each Church
[43:36] age I think we went through
[43:41] that out of each Church age you have
[43:44] their
[43:46] Overcomers
[43:48] amen chosen
[43:51] out of each Church
[43:55] age
[43:56] have you seen
[43:59] that and
[44:01] now the
[44:03] bride is not
[44:06] several different
[44:11] churches is the
[44:15] [Music]
[44:17] bright right
[44:19] amen if you were to bring churches
[44:25] together you get the
[44:31] differences are you going to call that
[44:33] the
[44:34] bread
[44:37] no you can have a
[44:49] bright differences yes
[44:52] amen you can't have this type of the
[44:55] Bride
[44:58] and this type of the that type of the no
[45:02] you have the
[45:06] briad is the bread of
[45:10] Christ that's why Christ made sure that
[45:15] at the end of time he introduced his
[45:22] wife he he's not a polygamous
[45:27] not
[45:28] wives but he has to introduce the
[45:32] wife so you are going to
[45:35] see when we go back to
[45:39] this the
[45:41] seventh
[45:45] seal it brings the white
[45:49] stone
[45:53] interpretation
[45:54] because uh the real real
[45:59] message came from
[46:01] within the
[46:05] constellation the
[46:07] seven
[46:11] se you know when it
[46:16] started then the prophet of
[46:19] God at first he went
[46:24] West
[46:35] now in the
[46:37] Bible it it
[46:40] says uh the Garden of
[46:42] Eden you know there was
[46:46] Eden the headquarters of
[46:50] God the garden of
[46:53] Ed the headquarters of son
[46:58] [Music]
[47:01] you amen ask brother
[47:05] will now
[47:08] Eden
[47:16] was that's why he
[47:23] says the angel took me
[47:26] to the West
[47:30] yes the garden the garden man was placed
[47:38] Eastward and you watch him like last we
[47:42] read something
[47:44] here I can just read that part for
[47:49] now then we'll come back to
[47:54] finish at this part
[47:58] all right
[47:59] amen because we still have one thing in
[48:02] our spiritual
[48:07] mind we have the three and a half
[48:13] years of the Lord Jesus Christ and the 3
[48:18] and a half
[48:19] years of Lucifer
[48:23] Lucifer I read it
[48:26] you amen is the prophet saying that 3
[48:30] and a half years and 3 and a half years
[48:34] where we are
[48:35] now
[48:38] H we are have done past the three and
[48:41] half
[48:45] years that was of the
[48:49] prophecy of
[48:52] Christ he says the prophet
[49:00] brother and a
[49:04] half amen am I
[49:07] right yes is that right Jesus Christ
[49:12] Jesus
[49:14] Christ
[49:16] prophesied for how
[49:22] long now and he says
[49:27] now there is 3 and a half years of
[49:35] Satan
[49:37] named
[49:42] called right
[49:45] amen
[49:46] now the
[49:48] bride is now looking
[49:52] with
[49:54] uh
[49:56] another
[50:01] I
[50:03] because the world now is
[50:09] entering the 3 and a half years of
[50:16] Lucifer what a terrible
[50:21] thing have you ever seen the world
[50:24] without the Lord
[50:27] [Music]
[50:30] Jesus you still can
[50:35] smile go to shop and do
[50:39] things because the Rapture has not yet
[50:47] taken but it will take the Rapture will
[50:53] go very very
[50:56] very I don't know which
[51:00] day but it's
[51:04] going according to the
[51:07] signs that we have
[51:10] seen
[51:13] uh what do they call
[51:16] this events
[51:21] now how do they
[51:24] interpret
[51:27] the events that
[51:32] are like what we
[51:34] see water
[51:38] earthquake rains and so
[51:41] [Applause]
[51:42] forth and they call
[51:45] it disasters natural disasters yeah but
[51:49] they call
[51:52] it okay leave there
[51:56] the Bible according to the
[52:00] Bible they as the Lord Jesus a
[52:05] question about this
[52:08] time and he said oh hey
[52:11] Brethren as it
[52:13] was in the
[52:16] days
[52:18] of what
[52:24] wasat
[52:26] then if you take the
[52:29] book Seven Church ages seven Church ages
[52:32] it tells you about thean church
[52:36] age church
[52:39] that the Lan
[52:42] church that
[52:44] was
[52:47] theia was a place of
[52:50] floods
[52:54] earthquakes
[53:00] get your
[53:02] book read and then it will tell you
[53:08] that this church
[53:14] age okay now H I'm going to finish just
[53:20] now now we see
[53:24] that the world
[53:27] now has gone that
[53:31] far as the prophet
[53:36] says
[53:38] this
[53:39] laition
[53:43] condition is just like that of the time
[53:47] of
[53:50] Noah but you know I was blessed
[53:54] that
[53:56] God spoke to
[54:01] Abraham the
[54:04] seed you read will come to
[54:07] that that the Bible says we are the Seed
[54:11] of
[54:15] Abraham you know
[54:17] seed in every
[54:24] field where city is
[54:27] planted there will be also the
[54:34] weeds all right
[54:37] amen then in that Garden some are not
[54:41] some of the uh seats there are not
[54:49] predestinated but
[54:51] among
[54:53] all that's coming up
[54:56] [Music]
[54:58] when there is a seat that is
[55:06] predestinated a
[55:08] brother ask a
[55:12] question why brother is quiet while the
[55:15] people are talking B about
[55:21] you I said why the Lord Jesus
[55:28] quiet who's this one who stood before
[55:31] him accusing
[55:35] him are you the king of the
[55:39] Jews the Bible says the
[55:42] [Applause]
[55:45] Jesus that's the nature of the
[55:52] seed amen amen
[55:55] he
[56:01] didn't he knows that this they don't
[56:06] hear
[56:07] him they will never hear him it's
[56:10] another seat
[56:13] amen so the Bible say he
[56:18] quiet I think I another Soldier smacked
[56:23] him
[56:26] how can you be quiet can't you hear what
[56:28] you being asked the Lord Jesus knew
[56:31] that to answer this person is just as if

[56:49] Jesus amen amen and he knew that the
[56:54] accusation
[56:55] was coming from
[56:59] Satan the people who came before him
[57:03] chos him just
[57:06] vels used by
[57:10] [Applause]
[57:13] Satan so that's why he
[57:17] kept because you answer them you don't
[57:20] answer
[57:23] them
[57:28] he let he let it flow like
[57:33] that amen amen now I said you remember I

[1:05:02] now did you notice
[1:05:05] that since
[1:05:07] ever H we've been talking about the

[1:05:20] [Music]
[1:05:23] seven amen okay amen and uh I don't have
[1:05:28] the book but we are coming with
[1:05:31] that where the Prophet says pyramid
[1:05:37] pyramid Enoch Enoch the seventh
[1:05:41] man
[1:05:43] from
[1:05:46] Adam he came with this

[1:06:23] themselves
[1:06:29] and the white stone was
[1:06:33] within the
[1:06:36] pyramid so the ministry at the
[1:06:40] end was not the church
[1:06:43] ages church but was the
[1:06:47] constellation and the prophet was
[1:06:51] put within that constellation
[1:06:56] then he says when the Angels
[1:06:59] Came they put them him into the Pyramid
[1:07:04] of

[1:08:36] preach he
[1:08:42] open now to open is not to
[1:08:45] [Applause]
[1:08:47] preach now if the people are waiting for
[1:08:50] the preaching from the pul pit
[1:08:55] and they said yeah yeah now I've got
[1:08:58] it no it's not coming that way it is
[1:09:03] open
[1:09:09] revealed if God says I will open unto

[1:09:18] that he doesn't say I will
[1:09:22] preach amen
[1:09:24] amen I can prove to you
[1:09:28] that the world is full of
[1:09:32] preachers even the new ones are coming
[1:09:38] up but
[1:09:42] those are
[1:09:48] imitators
[1:09:51] preaching over
[1:09:55] but what what is coming up
[1:10:02] now talks
[1:10:04] about
[1:10:05] impersonation yeah
[1:10:09] impersonation he says
[1:10:11] it I take the
[1:10:15] notes then afterwards I
[1:10:19] say last night God spoke to me
[1:10:22] Hallelujah
[1:10:24] hallelujah amen amen but the thing was
[1:10:27] preached by the
[1:10:31] brother now instead of
[1:10:33] saying I was blessed when
[1:10:36] brother
[1:10:39] preached that this
[1:10:41] Angel would know God spoke to
[1:10:49] me like if I come here I don't come here

[1:12:17] yours amen he knew that he has no
[1:12:21] message for the people
[1:12:24] these are the people of God I think
[1:12:26] every preacher should learn
[1:12:28] that that you are preaching to the
[1:12:32] children of God and it is God who knows
[1:12:36] what to say to
[1:12:42] his that's why

[1:13:09] blessed when brother

[1:13:44] pyramid because that's where the thing
[1:13:48] is can I read you
[1:13:51] something um where oh let
[1:13:56] me find it quickly
[1:13:58] amen uh because this
[1:14:03] message we have read last
[1:14:06] time
[1:14:08] that it's not from
[1:14:15] 19 it's way
[1:14:18] back the seven
[1:14:22] seal where when did it
[1:14:25] start let me find you this
[1:14:29] place where did he start
[1:14:34] brother way
[1:14:37] back where's my page here this seven SE
[1:14:43] all the way
[1:14:45] back from
[1:14:50] genisis or Genesis what do you say
[1:14:55] Genesis you agree with the
[1:15:00] bread doubt
[1:15:04] some all the way
[1:15:07] back this
[1:15:10] seven
[1:15:12] seal is spoken
[1:15:15] of that is Page 483 of
[1:15:20] s spoken of from the very
[1:15:27] beginning in
[1:15:30] Genesis the
[1:15:32] seven amen you see where it is coming
[1:15:36] from amen spoken of
[1:15:44] from that's why if you can see
[1:15:50] this the message here at the end
[1:15:57] is not H by any
[1:16:01] person
[1:16:03] because
[1:16:04] already it was spoken
[1:16:08] of
[1:16:11] back now this is the time of the
[1:16:15] attributes because it is the
[1:16:19] attributes uh who can she
[1:16:24] something that God
[1:16:27] spoke there attribute was in his
[1:16:32] mind and today there are
[1:16:37] people but the message coming to the
[1:16:41] attributes was not started was not
[1:16:44] spoken
[1:16:45] of from
[1:16:48] 19 before the foundation of the
[1:16:52] world believe the prophet of God he says
[1:16:57] you were in his
[1:16:59] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:17:03] when he started to open the MTH there
[1:17:05] were some amens from
[1:17:09] the and those attributes are me
[1:17:16] now amen that's why praise God they can
[1:17:20] hear the
[1:17:22] gospel
[1:17:24] that was never preached any
[1:17:27] age but they have heard
[1:17:31] him when they were
[1:17:34] attributes now brother bam says these
[1:17:39] attributes at the end time they will do
[1:17:42] exactly
[1:17:47] like you know the Bible
[1:17:50] says of the Seed of Abraham
[1:17:55] did you read
[1:17:56] in
[1:18:00] Galatians it
[1:18:06] says we have
[1:18:08] Isaac but it says you are the Seed of
[1:18:12] Abraham but have you
[1:18:14] realized you read where it
[1:18:19] said
[1:18:20] Jesus is this Christ is the Seed of
[1:18:25] Abraham amen
[1:18:28] [Music]
[1:18:31] amen who has seen
[1:18:34] that Brothers there Elder how are
[1:18:38] you Seed of
[1:18:41] Abraham it
[1:18:43] sayses Christ
[1:18:45] also it says you are the Seed of
[1:18:48] Abraham Christ is the Seed of Abraham
[1:18:53] amen what does that
[1:18:57] mean do you have it brother in your
[1:19:00] book yes I think Galatians 3 amen verse
[1:19:06] 16 now to Abraham and his seat where the
[1:19:09] promise is made yes he Seth not and to
[1:19:13] seeds as of many amen but as of one and
[1:19:17] to thy seat which is Christ
[1:19:20] right to thy seat
[1:19:24] which
[1:19:28] is that's why
[1:19:32] brother you are born
[1:19:36] again
[1:19:38] because you are a
[1:19:44] seed then I read
[1:19:47] C where it
[1:19:50] says God gave bir
[1:20:00] to it's how he puts
[1:20:04] it God gave
[1:20:08] bir to
[1:20:11] hisself then he become become as
[1:20:17] Jesus amen
[1:20:20] because we don't have the mother of
[1:20:27] God
[1:20:30] Amen even
[1:20:36] Jesus he was the
[1:20:39] seed that came to
[1:20:43] Mary now the word of God says when
[1:20:49] Gabriel came to
[1:20:51] Mary actually he was bringing the
[1:20:55] seed the seed is the word that he
[1:21:01] spoke and when Mary
[1:21:04] believed and said be it unto me could
[1:21:08] into
[1:21:13] your
[1:21:16] then the seat started to
[1:21:19] materialize the
[1:21:21] word
[1:21:23] in
[1:21:25] Mary the real real
[1:21:30] message you know there's something in
[1:21:32] this
[1:21:33] book can I check it amen all right I
[1:21:38] check it while I'm looking at the time
[1:21:43] there um let me take you back to
[1:21:50] this and the blood
[1:21:54] test blood test shows whether you go are
[1:22:00] of God or
[1:22:06] not I will remember to bring that book
[1:22:10] with
[1:22:11] me in the book of
[1:22:15] seals it speaks of the word being the
[1:22:21] blood
[1:22:29] and when he came
[1:22:32] to
[1:22:35] Mary to bring the
[1:22:39] way now the prophet puts it this
[1:22:45] way the way of the
[1:22:48] Bride says that
[1:22:50] word in Mary
[1:22:55] materialized and became
[1:23:01] blood so if you it says you are saved of
[1:23:04] the
[1:23:06] blood the word that you have
[1:23:10] received is the
[1:23:13] blood but we are talking about the real
[1:23:16] way
[1:23:21] just
[1:23:24] amen
[1:23:26] amen the
[1:23:28] word spoken from a
[1:23:34] seed becomes a seed
[1:23:38] [Applause]
[1:23:40] am amen
[1:23:42] amen if that word you have received is
[1:23:46] not a
[1:23:51] SE where are you
[1:23:54] going no life because life comes from
[1:23:59] the
[1:24:00] Sea by the
[1:24:04] SE to be born
[1:24:07] again it's when you are
[1:24:11] Ace to begin
[1:24:13] with he understand this
[1:24:17] word born
[1:24:19] again is not referring to everybody
[1:24:24] is to
[1:24:27] AED that should come back
[1:24:35] again if you are arguing I'll read it
[1:24:39] for you okay now listen the blood
[1:24:44] test
[1:24:45] shows whether you are of God or
[1:24:51] not
[1:24:56] now this blood
[1:24:58] test is not the done through an
[1:25:03] injection
[1:25:05] no it is the
[1:25:08] word now Christ also being the
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:15] seed now this
[1:25:18] seed when it was
[1:25:21] born
[1:25:23] it became a a
[1:25:26] man human
[1:25:30] form right amen then he speaks to
[1:25:35] you the
[1:25:37] word amen don't you don't
[1:25:42] try to hear the word from
[1:25:48] me amen no amen pray and say Lord
[1:25:52] I'm going to the service speak to
[1:25:57] [Applause]
[1:26:00] me and God will speak to
[1:26:05] you through his
[1:26:08] servant and another
[1:26:12] mystery if it is God speaking to a
[1:26:14] predestinated
[1:26:18] seity that
[1:26:20] person receives
[1:26:22] it as the word of
[1:26:26] God that's why he cannot
[1:26:30] impersonate because he has
[1:26:33] received the
[1:26:36] word of
[1:26:38] God which is the
[1:26:42] blood amen we are going to go to get
[1:26:47] into the
[1:26:50] test we'll bring this flying
[1:26:54] interpretation and these other
[1:26:57] things the con in the
[1:27:01] conation when the prophet
[1:27:04] said remain here look
[1:27:11] inside
[1:27:13] inside amen amen and the and it says
[1:27:19] while they were looking inside
[1:27:23] he started to walk
[1:27:26] away now it tells me that the others
[1:27:31] started to
[1:27:36] leave
[1:27:38] because
[1:27:40] Revelation
[1:27:42] 7 when it
[1:27:45] open do you see
[1:27:48] anything it
[1:27:51] was
[1:27:55] silence but you must say silence in
[1:28:00] heaven silence you say silence or silent
[1:28:03] I don't silence amen amen in
[1:28:08] heaven and not
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:16] on I hear people say it was
[1:28:19] silent say it was silent in heaven amen
[1:28:24] because here on there was a
[1:28:27] messenger
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:30] amen who came when it was silent in
[1:28:35] heaven something here
[1:28:39] was
[1:28:42] amen and
[1:28:44] then
[1:28:46] because it was not meant to be you can't
[1:28:50] go to heaven to preach
[1:28:56] now I'm closing with
[1:28:58] this blood
[1:29:02] test shows whether you're of God you
[1:29:07] know I was looking at
[1:29:11] something I'll come with that something
[1:29:14] because the Bible says when he shall
[1:29:19] appear we shall be
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:27] okay
[1:29:29] amen you know the reason is you have
[1:29:33] some people
[1:29:35] here but we we'll come with those
[1:29:42] things
[1:29:44] if maybe I happen
[1:29:48] to see
[1:29:50] myself
[1:29:54] and a young
[1:30:01] person
[1:30:03] inst instram or W you never know but
[1:30:08] things like
[1:30:11] that now if you find me
[1:30:15] there pH me immediately because the
[1:30:18] Bible says when he shall
[1:30:20] appear
[1:30:24] amen amen
[1:30:27] what I we all want to be like
[1:30:32] him I want to see myself in
[1:30:40] him after I was
[1:30:43] born never said to me you get
[1:30:47] yourself or let the people see you I
[1:30:51] don't want to
[1:30:53] I want to be SE of
[1:30:56] God that's
[1:31:01] all now after you see me being a person
[1:31:04] what will
[1:31:05] happen what is that for I'll come and
[1:31:08] read you those
[1:31:10] things the people shall be the lovers
[1:31:15] lovers
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:20] of state of seeing
[1:31:24] Jesus if state of a
[1:31:28] desire to see Jesus you have the desire
[1:31:33] to see
[1:31:38] yourself thank you for yes
[1:31:45] say all right amen every
[1:31:50] time you know
[1:31:53] even when
[1:31:55] maybe it's night time I'm
[1:32:00] sleeping I just say to
[1:32:04] God I want to see
[1:32:07] you the people who were in his
[1:32:11] mind amen they are working now they want
[1:32:16] to touch
[1:32:17] him they want to meet him they want to
[1:32:21] see
[1:32:30] a cre
[1:32:31] creation the real creation wants to see
[1:32:35] the
[1:32:38] Creator a creation that wants to see
[1:32:45] itself is not in the form of
[1:32:49] God because if you are in the form of
[1:32:52] God and you were
[1:32:54] created that's why the people who who
[1:32:58] knows very well that they came from
[1:33:02] him even now they are looking for
[1:33:06] him
[1:33:09] amen they want to reflect
[1:33:13] him they want him to reflect
[1:33:16] them because they came
[1:33:20] from
[1:33:24] you take
[1:33:26] chickens or anything that is
[1:33:32] Born the mother G gives
[1:33:37] birth amen after that even in humans
[1:33:42] when a child is born the first
[1:33:46] thing he he he can smell
[1:33:50] milk from
[1:33:53] Mama but it is not by a smell that is
[1:33:57] the
[1:33:58] nature that I came out
[1:34:03] of he goes back to
[1:34:08] Mama that's why the prophet say respect
[1:34:13] your
[1:34:15] mama because she was the first person to
[1:34:19] see
[1:34:20] you
[1:34:22] when you will
[1:34:26] come and now as soon as the
[1:34:30] child this baby is
[1:34:39] born he is born with the
[1:34:42] revelation of this
[1:34:46] kind when he start to sck one is not to
[1:34:52] to do what what you
[1:34:55] say
[1:34:58] okay she will never turn to
[1:35:02] anybody but to
[1:35:07] M
[1:35:10] because it came out
[1:35:16] of did you see
[1:35:19] that now that's
[1:35:24] why
[1:35:25] men can
[1:35:29] live a man can leave
[1:35:34] children and go on drinking
[1:35:42] spring thinking not
[1:35:45] about his
[1:35:47] children but watch the heart of a mama
[1:35:55] I grew
[1:35:56] up
[1:35:59] under my
[1:36:03] mother because you
[1:36:09] came from your mother that's
[1:36:14] why your father can leave
[1:36:17] you but your
[1:36:19] mama will always is coming say where
[1:36:22] where is my
[1:36:26] child you see relationship of child and
[1:36:31] mother is greater than relationship of
[1:36:35] child
[1:36:41] and agree or
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:46] disagree I
[1:36:49] grew under
[1:36:52] my
[1:36:53] mother not father my father left me when
[1:36:57] when I was still
[1:37:00] young and the
[1:37:02] mother was
[1:37:06] struggling finding PE jobs
[1:37:11] so
[1:37:14] selling things and
[1:37:16] so and here I
[1:37:20] am
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:26] amen amen because when I was born he
[1:37:31] died she
[1:37:35] died then those who
[1:37:39] know she told everybody about
[1:37:43] it says how she
[1:37:47] died but she was told
[1:37:50] that
[1:37:52] Mary go back look after your
[1:37:57] children that's a
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:01] mother then when she woke
[1:38:06] up and I was
[1:38:10] born
[1:38:12] then I realized that they given me the
[1:38:20] name
[1:38:26] is that
[1:38:28] so
[1:38:39] yeah and me or the lightning that that
[1:38:44] is
[1:38:48] Mama then um here today thanking God
[1:38:53] together with
[1:38:55] you
[1:38:59] am and I'll be so glad the day we
[1:39:05] meet the now now now the gospel now is

[1:41:08] reputation so the others

[1:41:15] job and they said we'll take the job to

[1:41:26] that they arrive at the
[1:41:31] send and they came back from
[1:41:33] there and said it
[1:41:37] descend so we can't build a
