[1:52:39] i'm going to read this part to you here
[1:52:46] [Music]
[1:52:57] this seventh seal
[1:53:00] the seventh seal is spoken of
[1:53:06] from the very beginning
[1:53:09] in genesis who can
[1:53:24] again
[1:53:27] i think i've got them together here
[1:53:32] it is in this book
[1:53:38] i think
[1:53:39] the unveiling of god
[1:53:42] i should be having one year the
[1:53:44] unveiling and what in unveiling of page
[1:53:47] 42 it says
[1:53:49] page 42 18. um
[1:53:53] yes it says
[1:53:55] the seventh seals
[1:53:57] the seventh seal
[1:53:59] open up the revelation
[1:54:02] of islam what that was
[1:54:31] what is all revealed in there
[1:54:48] amen amen because the bride should be
[1:54:51] preaching
[1:54:57] to what is
[1:55:01] do you understand that
[1:55:04] you really can bring
[1:55:06] the
[1:55:08] full
[1:55:09] perfect message
[1:55:13] we don't have
[1:55:15] what that was
[1:55:32] where is that party
[1:55:34] this is the feast of the trumpets
[1:55:37] the fist of the trumpet and the seven
[1:55:39] seals had the mysterious hid
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:55] the bride is made of that was
[1:56:13] i don't know let me repeat it
[1:56:16] the bride of christ
[1:56:22] and that is
[1:56:24] this is what makes the bride of christ
[1:56:27] [Music]
[1:56:29] now you listen to
[1:56:31] the message preached by the bride
[1:56:37] is different
[1:56:39] from any other message
[1:56:42] because it is that words
[1:56:52] all right
[1:56:53] okay now i will leave it there
[1:56:56] the seven seals mystery
[1:57:00] power is combined
[1:57:03] of
[1:57:04] what it was
[1:57:06] it all was
[1:57:22] has to bring
[1:57:35] it's supposed to open in the last
[1:57:38] day
[1:57:44] at the end of
[1:57:46] time
[1:57:49] because
[1:57:50] that was
[1:57:53] before time
[1:57:58] now if it was before time
[1:58:01] then it will
[1:58:03] come to the end
[1:58:06] after the end of time
[1:58:07] [Music]
[1:58:09] like the seventh
[1:58:11] church age
[1:58:14] was i i have tried to demand it a time
[1:58:27] because
[1:58:29] it says in the book the the rapture
[1:58:46] is
[1:58:53] there are things that you hear me
[1:58:55] repeating time and again
[1:58:59] just for the sake of repeating
[1:59:02] it is because it isn't yet found
[1:59:07] you know jesus said to the the
[1:59:11] pharisees which is what you didn't find
[1:59:14] them in those
[1:59:32] [Music]
[1:59:42] it finds a place
[1:59:44] that place was there all the time
[1:59:50] for israel all right
[1:59:52] now we keep on repeating things
[1:59:55] that they couldn't find a place in the
[1:59:58] people
[2:00:00] but if there is no place
[2:00:04] you can repeat it
[2:00:06] still it won't help
[2:00:08] what a negative because it has no place
[2:00:12] you know in the bible
[2:00:15] you
[2:00:16] you read everything
[2:00:19] place contradicts the place of god
[2:00:23] [Music]
[2:00:24] because
[2:00:30] [Music]
[2:00:36] has got no place in you
[2:00:40] right maybe we are waiting for light or
[2:00:43] i don't know
[2:00:45] somebody stealing the
[2:00:47] i'll use somebody else's torch
[2:00:51] okay that's why bible
[2:00:57] you don't know when the lights will
[2:01:00] switch off
[2:01:03] ah amen
[2:01:05] so
[2:01:06] fountain
[2:01:09] when one light switches off
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:14] then we have another light then he said
[2:01:18] okay amen all right now
[2:01:22] we are
[2:01:23] i'm through that
[2:01:25] i think you have had it
[2:01:28] what is that
[2:01:33] in these books
[2:01:35] now i'm going to
[2:01:37] the book
[2:01:38] one of the
[2:01:41] wonderful
[2:01:42] books
[2:01:43] see zoya
[2:01:45] what is this smelly kiss
[2:01:48] who is this multi-sedec
[2:01:53] that is another
[2:01:54] one
[2:01:59] who is this milky seduc
[2:02:02] you know
[2:02:18] [Music]
[2:02:24] as he came as a son of man
[2:02:30] i will go back again jesus the prophet
[2:02:34] said
[2:02:35] um
[2:02:36] something in me
[2:02:39] met that male kiss
[2:02:44] yesterday i don't know if i should ask
[2:02:47] one person to come and say
[2:02:49] what does that mean
[2:02:55] he doesn't say i meant that
[2:02:58] sometimes
[2:03:12] when
[2:03:15] [Music]
[2:03:21] [Music]
[2:03:37] this one is coming to the one who is in
[2:03:40] abraham you can see with us
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:47] now that's why he says
[2:03:49] something in me
[2:03:55] that means something in me
[2:03:58] you should imagine that something in
[2:04:00] that prophet
[2:04:05] when he approached i will read it when
[2:04:08] he approached
[2:04:09] a
[2:04:10] when he approached abraham
[2:04:13] about what um
[2:04:15] i'll start from
[2:04:17] because this is for the seed
[2:04:22] uh but then
[2:04:25] where is the royal seed of abraham
[2:04:28] ap
[2:04:30] of course now not just the seed
[2:04:33] but there is
[2:04:58] [Music]
[2:05:05] but as of one and two seed which is cast
[2:05:09] right
[2:05:13] nothing
[2:05:14] here
[2:05:16] to thy seed
[2:05:18] which
[2:05:31] christ
[2:05:32] god bless you
[2:05:33] amen all right
[2:05:36] so the seed
[2:05:37] remains
[2:05:38] christ in christ
[2:05:41] that's why if you receive christ
[2:05:45] follow christ
[2:05:47] you when if you receive
[2:05:50] christ
[2:05:53] in the book
[2:05:55] uh
[2:05:56] seven church ages it says in what the
[2:05:59] seven church
[2:06:00] ages it speaks of the seed
[2:06:06] meaning
[2:06:08] the reason you are born again
[2:06:13] it is because
[2:06:14] you are a seed
[2:06:16] [Music]
[2:06:19] that's why you are born
[2:06:28] next time you get seed
[2:06:32] from the very same seed you have planted
[2:06:35] it
[2:06:38] and then you plant again
[2:07:08] so blinded
[2:07:10] by even
[2:07:24] [Music]

[2:11:04] that he said
[2:11:06] as it was in the days of sodom
[2:11:15] [Music]
[2:11:23] and when he is manifested in human flesh
[2:11:26] that means he is in the form of
[2:11:30] men
[2:11:32] to shoot you but that is god
[2:11:35] [Music]
[2:11:36] how can you
[2:11:40] as he comes as a man

[2:12:49] [Music]
[2:12:52] he has seen melchizedek
[2:12:57] but
[2:12:58] the time he saw him
[2:13:00] he was
[2:13:02] [Music]
[2:13:09] when he
[2:13:10] is introduced
[2:13:13] as the one without mother with some soul
[2:13:16] father
[2:13:19] no beginning of days
[2:13:26] without father
[2:13:28] without
[2:13:31] then he was one time introduced as jesus
[2:13:35] the savior
[2:13:36] there was this one yeah
[2:13:38] still the same man
[2:13:42] amen we see him
[2:13:46] at
[2:13:47] another time
[2:13:53] that is the same one for something
[2:13:56] you know
[2:13:58] a being without father without mother
[2:14:00] without beginning of days without ending
[2:14:03] of days

[2:16:12] man
[2:16:29] [Music]
[2:16:44] that is something else now
[2:16:48] if
[2:16:50] the lord jesus

[3:07:45] [Music]
[3:07:50] now

[3:08:23] see
[3:08:25] listen to that can i read
[3:08:28] all right
[3:08:30] let's start here
[3:08:33] the son that was with the father in the
[3:08:36] beginning was the logos
[3:08:42] you know logos is
[3:08:45] theophany
[3:08:54] you know in the sixth dimension
[3:08:59] they don't drink
[3:09:12] and it was the theophany of god that
[3:09:15] went out of
[3:09:16] that
[3:09:17] that went out
[3:09:21] the human form that didn't have eye like
[3:09:24] you see
[3:09:42] is
[3:09:46] we don't take the word of god
[3:09:49] the same
[3:09:50] thing
[3:09:55] another one comes halfway
[3:10:05] is deeper than just
[3:10:10] what
[3:10:22] oh
[3:10:52] m
[3:11:15] [Music]
[3:11:17] and they are no longer
[3:11:20] sinners
[3:11:22] by god's
[3:11:23] grace
[3:11:28] if they look at sin
[3:11:31] amen amen they
[3:11:34] they will go back
[3:11:37] they look at god
[3:11:41] if you put sin and god before them
[3:11:44] they will
[3:11:45] sin
[3:11:47] by your memory and choose god
[3:11:59] amen
[3:12:00] shall i finish here
[3:12:02] abraham
[3:12:17] [Music]
[3:12:24] [Music]
[3:12:30] is
[3:12:59] [Music]
[3:13:21] we find out that our bodies are made of
[3:13:23] 16 elements
[3:13:26] of the
[3:13:48] now
[3:13:48] let me take this one here
[3:13:53] you listen to this one
[3:13:56] i think it's 4.99
[3:14:02] god was this great
[3:14:04] fountain of seven colors
[3:14:12] and you know uh you go to genesis
[3:14:15] chapter seven back there and the nine we
[3:14:18] are looking it speaks of their rendering
[3:14:21] seven and nine okay
[3:14:27] [Music]
[3:14:33] that's why when the people see rainbow
[3:14:35] they say our
[3:14:38] [Music]
[3:14:51] you know in the bible
[3:14:52] [Music]
[3:14:55] but all this is now coming together
[3:15:00] you know right in the message as we are
[3:15:02] closing
[3:15:04] all you
[3:15:15] has arrived
[3:15:17] [Music]
[3:15:31] [Music]
[3:15:45] immortality
[3:16:00] then it says god coming from this
[3:16:02] fountain
[3:16:09] made the logos which we call the
[3:16:10] theophany
[3:16:13] it is in the form of a man but yet it is
[3:16:17] not flesh
[3:16:26] if you if if you take the theophany when
[3:16:29] you are looking at that
[3:16:33] [Music]
[3:16:35] that is a man
[3:16:37] that's where we were in the beginning
[3:16:42] in the beginning
[3:16:51] [Music]
[3:17:10] [Applause]
[3:17:18] [Music]
[3:17:24] i will
[3:17:38] uh it's a dwelling place of god
[3:17:43] you know it says
[3:17:45] when
[3:17:46] god was
[3:17:47] the way it was in moses
[3:17:50] when the weight was in moses
[3:17:53] moses was god
[3:17:57] okay while you are wondering
[3:18:00] god said to moses
[3:18:06] because pharaoh was a god
[3:18:09] now god wouldn't challenge pharaoh
[3:18:11] with just a mere man
[3:18:14] challenge
[3:18:15] to be a god
[3:18:18] against a god
[3:18:29] [Music]
[3:18:47] let's make things better so that we can
[3:18:49] close
[3:18:50] essentially
[3:18:54] if god sends a prophet
[3:18:58] is god
[3:18:59] himself
[3:19:03] [Music]
[3:19:16] of the trumpets
[3:19:20] of the trumpet
[3:19:21] when
[3:19:22] abraham and sarah were looking for
[3:19:26] the coming son
[3:19:55] as he spoke to abraham
[3:20:10] he changed the body of abraham and sarah
[3:20:15] immediately
[3:20:17] after this
[3:20:19] so they could receive the sun
[3:20:23] they were older
[3:20:50] [Music]
[3:21:08] being i will come
[3:21:11] and sarah shall have a son
[3:21:15] at the appointed time
[3:21:21] so that's it
[3:21:23] now i'm trying to close with this year

[3:21:27] notice the last sign that they
[3:21:30] got
[3:21:33] before the sun
[3:21:36] was generally
[3:21:43] [Applause]
[3:21:50] m you see like the people today
[3:21:55] they would not
[3:21:57] tolerate god talking in the form of a
[3:21:59] man
[3:22:04] they will
[3:22:19] [Music]
[3:22:30] they will hate you
