finished as he has de to and prop be oh I will sent you El the prophet before the great and and he shall there heart to the children their heart of their children to their father I come I might [Music] Holy Ghost G Holy [Music] [Applause] Ghost Holy G G [Applause] [Music] can you just take your seats for a while I thank you Mr master of [Music] ceremony I'm also greeting every everybody here if there are pastors agree them but let me just say protocol observed um so that no one should say he didn't greet me so I said protocol Ober we are happy to be in this ceremony and we believe God is here I believe is the one who is going to run this ceremony it's not me him if ever I run it according to how he run it before if according to my prophet in ceremonies like these ones my Prophet used not to preach he just came and officiate and live that is what I always do and I'm going to do it even today because my Prophet used to do like that but before I did that I believe my brother here will read me the the Bible as you stand all num chter 21 numbers 21 21 you read from verse 5 to [Music] 10 21 verse 5 and the people speak against God and against Moses wherefore have he brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our souls Lo this light and the Lord people [Music] people therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he take away the serpents from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fairy Serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he look upon it shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had beaten any man when he beheld The Serpent of brass he lived and the children of Israel set forward and pached in [Music] O amen yes Lord hallelujah amen amen yes Lord pray in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen we may take our seats um the incident which happened here I want to compare it with the incident it happened in the beginning because here the Bible say people spoke better about God than [Music] Moses because if you speak better about Moses you speak better about God Moses was the messenger of God for that particular dispensation [Music] by doing that they made God angry and God punished them by S by sending serpent so that those serpent can bite them you see those people of Israel had doctors doctors who could heal different diseases they moved through the Wilderness for several years they moved through the Wilderness for several years I believe they met several snakes there I believe those snakes bite them I believe those doctors killed those [Music] bites when it comes to this one doctors fail to kill that because when they tried to kill this one the snake bite them then they die while they're trying to help somebody there was no one who could help somebody they were all vulnerable in the beginning there when man fell everything fell this what the Bible says nature is groaning because why nature is Gro is groaning because it has fallen from somewhere they have fallen from their original position also marriage fell from the beginning there then we train social workers to try to melt the marriage but when they are trying they also have the problem of marriage then we trade marriage officers we trained marriage officers them also have a marriage problem there is no one who could cure this problem of [Applause] marriage just like there just like in Egypt just like in the wilderness the the the solution for that bite it was the Brazen snake which was placed upon the the pole by Moses and Jesus said as Moses plac the bra serent on a pole the sound of man will be placed like that it was for the same purpose because that snake there it was for the remission of their SS and for their healing and this one also it is for the same purpose it's for the remission of our sins and for healing us there is only one solution now for everything we have failed we have tried we have got 10 laws of marriage 10 laws of marriage but those laws have failed but there is only one solution that is Christ amen he's the only one because the Bible say in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the way was made flesh and those who have received it they've G they've been given power to become the children of God only receiving Christ you have a solution for marriage that's why the prophet didn't preach because when we when we bring people to be married we believe that they have had the message because the message is Christ amen and if you receive because if if you you you you identify the messenger of your [Music] age the messenger of your age and you recognize the message of your age and receive it and live by it that is the evidence that you have the Holy Spirit then we believe these two they have received the message of the hour because the message of the hour is only is the only solution of marriage there is no other solution there are people who don't receive who say they've received the message but they have not received it because if you have received it you will be let me say something like this when you fall at the beginning there you become you you receive the nature of an animal any person who is not born again he has got the nature of an animal that's why they kill one another because that nature is the nature of anyone but to get another nature is to be born again there is no birth birth comes by the seat and you must receive the seat to be born again and the seed is the word of God and the word of God moves through the body that's why the way the seat moved through philli moved through Philip and the UN of ethopia then the UN of Ethiopia in order to be born again he received the seat that's why the seat in this hour came through our prophet and from the prophet it went through pastors there because there is no any other channel that the word of God can travel without this channel this is the only Channel believe I am the part of the body which is carrying the seat if someone receive the SE the birth will be there sorry birth will be there because birth comes through the seat that's why we don't preach this ceremonies because we believe these ones theyve received the because we have baptized them we baptize somebody who says I believe we can't just baptize you tell us you believe the message when you believe the message we bapti then we believe that you are at the place where we are you have changed the nature of animal you have you have attained another the nature the nature of God because if you got the nature of God you are one with God and you and this sister if you if if you got the nature of God if the sister nature of God then you are one there is no need of Separation there nothing can separate you because you have got one nature that is the nature of but the problem is a sister when he see the message he found the brother in the message and the brother proposed the sister because the brother seems to be in the message only to find that that brother is not the then he a sheep and a lion and you cannot try to advise the sheep and the lion when you try to advise the lion the LI will say Amen but he waiting to De the Sheep only after some few months you hear that they have divorc that someone was a lion another one was a sheep those two Natures cannot match or the brother proposing a sister thinking that the sister is the the child of God but the sister is not the child of God he was he was just there looking for marriage after being married now her nature comes let me stop here stand up you [Applause] two let me pray our dear heavenly father I am approaching a delegate sensitive period where you said no man has power to join you are the only one who join them at the beginning and this is just a manifestation of what happened there if they've been joined by you I'm here to repeat what you have done help us Lord when I am approaching this be with me be with them amen I pray in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen when they come in front I don't know whether they come here they come in front um I'm starting with the um um going to ask who should I ask to pend over this lady to the brother then you tell me your name and you tell me your relationship with the lady amen amen [Music] [Applause] God bless you
