[1:16:44] hour is coming in the which all that are
[1:16:47] in the graves shall hear his voice okay
[1:16:51] let's let's bow our head
[1:16:56] heavenly father Yes father with our
[1:17:00] heads bow
[1:17:02] Lord we deem this our
[1:17:06] responsibility that whenever we approach
[1:17:09] this moment yes Lord we invite
[1:17:12] you because without thee Lord we won't
[1:17:15] make
[1:17:17] it because this Pulpit is yours yes and
[1:17:21] when you descend you descend upon this
[1:17:23] pulpit
[1:17:26] and father you have made also a Pulpit
[1:17:28] in the heart of men yes which you claim
[1:17:32] it is yours father when you created us
[1:17:37] you made your own pulpit in our
[1:17:39] hearts so father we open our hearts and
[1:17:43] invite you yes to come and take your
[1:17:45] place Lord amen and speak to us
[1:17:49] father we are so grateful father to have
[1:17:52] a
[1:17:53] moment where
[1:17:55] whereby we'll just keep quiet and hear
[1:17:58] thee speaking to
[1:18:00] us and we feel so blessed father Amen to
[1:18:04] have a Ministry yes Lord of the
[1:18:07] revelation of the seven seed yes Lord
[1:18:09] amen that empowers us with the power of
[1:18:13] the third
[1:18:14] pool may you take control father of each
[1:18:17] and every situation yes may you bless us
[1:18:21] Lord may you engage us that we pray
[1:18:24] calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:18:27] Christ
[1:18:29] amen you may be
[1:18:36] seated okay my title
[1:18:41] here it will be the changing from
[1:18:44] natural to
[1:18:52] Supernatural why are we saying that
[1:18:57] changing from
[1:19:00] natural to
[1:19:05] Supernatural because according to the
[1:19:08] process of
[1:19:12] events like I once say we
[1:19:17] at so
[1:19:19] now as the Seed of Abraham
[1:19:24] we need uh to know exactly what is
[1:19:29] suitable for us at this
[1:19:37] hour and then as long as
[1:19:41] we uh engage ourself with uh the
[1:19:47] relevant sermon and relevant Ministry
[1:19:56] then we are
[1:20:00] empowered are we
[1:20:02] together the power you know where is
[1:20:05] your
[1:20:07] power is when you do the right thing at
[1:20:11] the right
[1:20:15] time now if you are a
[1:20:18] father and you are aware that your son
[1:20:22] recognize that you are the father
[1:20:27] [Music]
[1:20:30] now it gives
[1:20:34] you power as the
[1:20:38] father to empower your
[1:20:44] son now when
[1:20:47] we as the Bride of our Lord Jesus
[1:20:52] Christ recognized
[1:20:56] the
[1:20:59] relevancy of the
[1:21:01] word at this
[1:21:03] time then God will support
[1:21:07] that because we are aware of his
[1:21:15] promises but but if we just preach up
[1:21:21] hazard it will be the word of God
[1:21:25] but
[1:21:29] irrelevant I mean if I can
[1:21:32] maybe start telling
[1:21:36] you say is the message say my message
[1:21:41] today is crossing the Red
[1:21:44] Sea then I told I I read the scripture
[1:21:48] and I tell you how did Moses cross the
[1:21:51] Red Sea
[1:21:55] and close the
[1:21:57] service then but you still need what God
[1:22:00] is doing today to
[1:22:07] you yes I told you about
[1:22:10] Moses but you still have a question
[1:22:14] mark about the things that you
[1:22:19] want
[1:22:22] now where are we right now
[1:22:26] okay our ministry uh I mean the Bible
[1:22:32] itself has got some
[1:22:35] promises are we together those promises
[1:22:39] came in the form of
[1:22:43] Dreams some of
[1:22:46] visions and some of
[1:22:49] prophecies the prophecy I mean the the
[1:22:52] promises of the time that you living
[1:22:58] you are now Beyond time isn't
[1:23:02] it you have crossed
[1:23:04] over you are
[1:23:07] Beyond now when you are
[1:23:10] beyond what is expected from
[1:23:15] God and what are you
[1:23:20] expecting are we together amen right
[1:23:23] let's touch a little spe of the
[1:23:27] prophecies or the
[1:23:30] dreams we we had a a major
[1:23:36] Dream by Brother
[1:23:40] Jun you know about
[1:23:43] that of the
[1:23:47] mountain brother was
[1:23:50] teaching then he took a crowbar
[1:23:54] and cut off
[1:23:57] the and when they look
[1:24:00] inside it was a white
[1:24:02] stone then he said okay I'm going
[1:24:06] westwards keep on looking
[1:24:09] at that is why the
[1:24:12] pastor does not shift from the White
[1:24:18] St because it's a
[1:24:21] promise and it was a dream that is in
[1:24:24] with
[1:24:28] us and the prophet saw seven ma
[1:24:37] visions that has to do with
[1:24:40] us now these seven major
[1:24:45] Visions
[1:24:46] they the first one was mus you know
[1:24:49] about
[1:24:51] it the the second one was
[1:24:54] hit so those things he saw them
[1:25:00] before then you know the third one was
[1:25:05] ISS
[1:25:07] FIS naism
[1:25:10] communism then communism will swallow
[1:25:13] them
[1:25:15] all now communism has swallowed them
[1:25:20] all and then he
[1:25:22] said watch right
[1:25:25] Russia King of the
[1:25:28] North it's a prophecy that come from the
[1:25:32] prophet and we are seeing what Russia is
[1:25:37] doing are we together and then he also
[1:25:41] spoke about
[1:25:44] science and then he went on speaking
[1:25:47] about the immorality of the
[1:25:50] world all those
[1:25:54] now we are left with
[1:25:56] two the one
[1:25:59] is H the the woman
[1:26:07] president there's a power in
[1:26:10] America that comes due to a popular vote
[1:26:14] by
[1:26:17] women which we might say it's in
[1:26:22] process the last
[1:26:24] one will
[1:26:27] be
[1:26:29] America being in De with
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:34] Russia Russia will destroy
[1:26:38] America it was seen by
[1:26:41] the Russia has got
[1:26:46] a which can destroy the whole
[1:26:50] world it's it's only you
[1:26:55] the bride that is blocking that
[1:26:58] thing because it can happen while you
[1:27:01] are
[1:27:06] SLE the Bible says it says there will be
[1:27:10] wars and rumors
[1:27:13] of aren't we seeing
[1:27:17] that that is in line
[1:27:20] now with uh the visions that the
[1:27:26] so okay amen
[1:27:29] now in
[1:27:32] order that we should
[1:27:37] go this natural
[1:27:40] body has to change to a
[1:27:48] supernatural but before it
[1:27:51] changes there should be a squeeze
[1:27:56] so which means
[1:27:58] then what we are waiting
[1:28:01] for is the
[1:28:04] squeeze mind you we're talking about the
[1:28:09] changing from the
[1:28:11] natural to a
[1:28:14] supernatural you have to
[1:28:19] change from the
[1:28:21] natural to a superal
[1:28:26] amen now let me start by reading a code
[1:28:32] here I didn't give the technical team
[1:28:35] that quote but it's on this book Abraham
[1:28:39] and his
[1:28:41] seat Abraham and his seat after
[1:28:46] him it's a paragraph 79 amen now it says
[1:28:52] here now we're talking about Chang
[1:28:56] when Abraham Abraham's body was
[1:29:01] changed Sarah's body was
[1:29:05] changed when Abraham's body was
[1:29:11] changed and s's body also was
[1:29:16] changed like it never had been changed
[1:29:19] before
[1:29:24] in a way that they could receive the
[1:29:27] promised
[1:29:33] son after being
[1:29:37] justified
[1:29:39] Sanctified filled with the Holy
[1:29:42] Spirit Changed by
[1:29:49] election the manifested
[1:29:52] god of Glory
[1:29:55] in the midst of
[1:29:59] him right amen and then the body was
[1:30:04] changed in order to receive the promised
[1:30:12] son right
[1:30:14] amen the next thing happened to Abraham
[1:30:17] was a changed
[1:30:20] body parag paragraph 18
[1:30:24] he had to have
[1:30:26] it never had a
[1:30:32] son and the next thing that happens to
[1:30:35] the
[1:30:37] church is the
[1:30:41] rapture right amen now in
[1:30:45] order that there should be a
[1:30:50] Rapture uh the Rapture has to do with
[1:30:53] the changing of your
[1:30:59] body so actually what we are waiting for
[1:31:05] now it's it's the
[1:31:08] squeeze you know when
[1:31:12] Israel was in
[1:31:14] Egypt the only way that he could go out
[1:31:17] of
[1:31:21] Egypt she has to be be
[1:31:26] squeezed otherwise they wouldn't go
[1:31:30] out that is why some of them on the
[1:31:34] way they kept on looking
[1:31:38] backwards thinking about the big ports
[1:31:40] of
[1:31:43] far right so those people would have
[1:31:47] never going
[1:31:50] out right that's why there was a squeeze
[1:31:56] they started killing their
[1:31:58] sons they start enslaving
[1:32:02] them then they started calling upon
[1:32:06] their they started remembering their
[1:32:11] promise because Abraham said you'll be
[1:32:14] in
[1:32:16] bondage but I'll come and pick you up
[1:32:19] take you
[1:32:20] out now they started reading those
[1:32:23] scriptures
[1:32:25] when when are you coming
[1:32:28] Lord amen right amen because of the

[1:33:46] there is something that has been
[1:33:48] manifested temporarily
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:33:57] so that very same
[1:33:59] thing it will be manifested in the
[1:34:02] fullness of
[1:34:08] it right amen
[1:34:10] that there's something that God has to
[1:34:13] do to
[1:34:17] you so that when that time
[1:34:22] comes you must must be
[1:34:24] able to
[1:34:27] go amen now
[1:34:30] going being
[1:34:33] raptured it's not an imaginary
[1:34:38] thing it's the Fulfillment of the
[1:34:43] wi it's it's the
[1:34:45] promise that it should
[1:34:49] happen amen right uh First Corinthians I
[1:34:53] I I love this
[1:34:56] scripture chapter 15 ver 45 15 ver
[1:35:02] 45 so now changing from natural to
[1:35:09] Supernatural it's a
[1:35:11] promise God has promised you you must be
[1:35:17] aware right
[1:35:20] amen can you read it my brother amen and
[1:35:23] so it is written the first man Adam was
[1:35:26] made a living Soul the last Adam was
[1:35:29] made a quickening spirit amen yeah you
[1:35:32] see now we're talking here about the the
[1:35:35] living
[1:35:38] soul and the quickening
[1:35:42] spirit amen now let me while I'm still
[1:35:47] on the what you call the squeeze that
[1:35:50] came down
[1:35:54] there's another code here it's still
[1:35:56] look away to
[1:35:57] Jesus Look Away to Jesus amen now in
[1:36:01] paragraph We were reading paragraph
[1:36:04] 39 listen what paragraph 38
[1:36:09] says now so now I'm going to say
[1:36:12] something to
[1:36:15] you that hav that I haven't said all
[1:36:21] along and that is the thing that we have
[1:36:24] looked forward to for so
[1:36:31] long for at least more than for at least
[1:36:35] many
[1:36:37] years four or five
[1:36:40] years or maybe
[1:36:43] long now he says here the third
[1:36:48] pool has now been Vindicated
[1:36:54] it means it's
[1:36:56] Justified remember why I'm reading
[1:36:59] this I'm supporting paragraph
[1:37:03] 399 where it says there's something that
[1:37:07] you have seen temporar being
[1:37:14] manifested that is the third
[1:37:16] point it's
[1:37:18] temporarily being manifested
[1:37:25] but now when it comes in
[1:37:28] full that's why he says now the third
[1:37:30] pool has been
[1:37:35] Vindicated which means it mean it has
[1:37:37] been
[1:37:40] Justified it has been proved to be
[1:37:46] correct amen right amen I'm sure you all
[1:37:50] know what it is
[1:37:56] because it has to
[1:37:59] do with the manifestations of the sons
[1:38:02] of
[1:38:05] God now how can the sons of God be
[1:38:11] manifested it should be the word of
[1:38:14] God that's why the prophet said the word
[1:38:18] is now in the
[1:38:20] bride when when it says the word is in
[1:38:23] the bride
[1:38:25] that is
[1:38:26] pool right amen is the
[1:38:31] revelation of the seventh
[1:38:34] SE then it gives you
[1:38:36] power that power is the third
[1:38:39] pool now it says that
[1:38:42] power has now been
[1:38:46] Vindicated I'm sure you know about
[1:38:50] it when when when when our Lord Jesus
[1:38:54] Christ manifested the third
[1:38:58] pool he went to
[1:39:00] hell and took the
[1:39:03] keys from the
[1:39:05] devil so the third pool is taking the
[1:39:09] keys from
[1:39:12] the what did our Lord Jesus Christ said
[1:39:14] to
[1:39:17] Peter he said upon this
[1:39:20] road I will build my church
[1:39:24] the Gates of
[1:39:27] Hell shall not Prevail
[1:39:30] against which means
[1:39:33] the in
[1:39:35] hell with the level of the of the Devil
[1:39:39] Himself the level of his
[1:39:42] angels level of of of of
[1:39:46] demons the level of the
[1:39:49] souls so he says those things
[1:39:53] when they come
[1:39:55] out it is called the
[1:39:59] gates they come through the
[1:40:02] gates now those
[1:40:05] keys that Peter
[1:40:07] had with the
[1:40:10] bride so the those Gates of
[1:40:15] Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:40:20] you there's quite a number of them
[1:40:25] they come in different
[1:40:28] forms we because we are
[1:40:32] blacks we know about the people that go
[1:40:35] to the rivers and things like
[1:40:38] that are some other
[1:40:41] nations that theyve got those
[1:40:43] gates in different
[1:40:48] ways so the third
[1:40:50] pool is capable
[1:40:54] to close down
[1:40:57] those that is why he says I'm sure you
[1:41:01] all know what it
[1:41:05] is among
[1:41:07] you there were those that
[1:41:10] were
[1:41:13] s they can tell
[1:41:16] you among you there are those that were
[1:41:20] devil worshippers
[1:41:23] here they worshiping God free
[1:41:28] now see the ministry has
[1:41:31] managed to go and fet them out
[1:41:37] of and clean them up and they sitting
[1:41:41] here they say hallelujah hallelujah are
[1:41:45] we together that is what we call the
[1:41:48] third
[1:41:50] P now that's why he says
[1:41:53] that is just a temporal
[1:41:57] one right but when it comes into his
[1:42:03] fullness say the that pool has now been
[1:42:11] Vindicated then vers paragraph 39 says
[1:42:14] 39
[1:42:16] now
[1:42:18] remember there'll never be an
[1:42:21] impersonation of that
[1:42:27] because it can't
[1:42:29] be see it cannot
[1:42:32] be
[1:42:36] right it cannot be
[1:42:42] impersonated it just happened so it
[1:42:44] could identify its presence among you
[1:42:49] [Music]
[1:42:53] it's it its
[1:42:56] presence see but it will not be used in
[1:43:00] a great will until the councel begins to
[1:43:04] tighten
[1:43:11] up there is what we
[1:43:15] call the World Council of
[1:43:20] churches they're busy tightening
[1:43:24] changing the
[1:43:26] Bible putting on some new
[1:43:29] laws now the prophet
[1:43:32] says it will not be used in great power
[1:43:35] the
[1:43:39] third until the acumenical
[1:43:45] C start to Tien
[1:43:48] up but when that time comes
[1:43:53] when the
[1:43:54] squeeze comes
[1:43:56] down then you will
[1:44:00] see what you've been seen
[1:44:06] temporarily you'll see what has been
[1:44:08] seen temporarily be
[1:44:13] manifested in fullness of his
[1:44:20] power that will be you now
[1:44:24] but
[1:44:25] in the
[1:44:32] Supernatural so the
[1:44:34] ministry is changing
[1:44:39] you from uh
[1:44:42] natural to
[1:44:45] Supernatural okay let's go to
[1:44:48] that uh Genesis chapter 2
[1:44:55] we read verse seven verse
[1:44:59] S Genesis 2 2 ver7 and the Lord God
[1:45:05] formed men of the Dust of the ground and
[1:45:09] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[1:45:11] life and Man became a living Soul right
[1:45:16] now and the Lord God formed not created
[1:45:24] right amen amen man of the
[1:45:28] dust and breath unto his
[1:45:32] nostril the breath of
[1:45:35] life after I breathed the Breath of
[1:45:41] Life Man became a living
[1:45:44] Soul remember we read about the first
[1:45:50] Adam who was made a living Stone
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:56] and the second
[1:45:57] item a quickening
[1:46:02] spirit now I'm reading question and
[1:46:05] answers and answers to to clarify what
[1:46:09] we have
[1:46:11] read paragraph
[1:46:15] 33 right now we
[1:46:19] are on roote
[1:46:23] the ministry
[1:46:26] now is the ministry of the
[1:46:30] angels to the
[1:46:36] angels now it's it's no more a Ministry
[1:46:41] of say don't do that don't do
[1:46:49] that it's
[1:46:51] now he that is
[1:46:56] filthy let him
[1:46:59] continue there's nothing that you can
[1:47:03] do you know when when Jesus said one of
[1:47:09] you who will deep with
[1:47:12] me there's nothing that Judas could
[1:47:17] do the only thing that he could
[1:47:20] do is to de
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:25] he's the son of
[1:47:28] pedition and the one that is
[1:47:32] filthy he is
[1:47:36] predestinated for
[1:47:39] condemnation you can't change
[1:47:43] him after such
[1:47:46] powerful messages that the
[1:47:50] pastor now if he hasn't changed
[1:47:55] then then what are you going to
[1:47:57] do and let let you who is
[1:48:02] Holy
[1:48:08] continue how we
[1:48:10] get so then it
[1:48:14] says uh paragraph 330 question and
[1:48:20] answers M here it says the one that was
[1:48:22] or you've got it says but as soon as it
[1:48:26] is born in this
[1:48:31] world and breathe its first
[1:48:36] breath it becomes a living
[1:48:40] Soul there's a Celestial
[1:48:43] body or a spiritual
[1:48:47] body just to take hold of it
[1:48:53] as soon as this natural body is
[1:48:59] dropped there is a Heavenly Tabernacle
[1:49:02] waiting for
[1:49:04] [Music]
[1:49:06] it I jump then I go to it says now and
[1:49:10] as soon as the spiritual
[1:49:17] body sorry as soon as the natural body
[1:49:22] is dissolved
[1:49:28] a spiritual body is
[1:49:32] waiting let's go back
[1:49:37] again because as soon as the Earthly
[1:49:40] body is Born Into the
[1:49:47] world a Celestial
[1:49:50] body or spiritual body
[1:49:53] to take hold of
[1:49:56] it as soon as this natural body is
[1:50:02] dropped there is Heavenly
[1:50:07] Tabernacle right amen now the other way
[1:50:10] around
[1:50:12] now as
[1:50:14] soon as soon as the natural body is
[1:50:20] dissolved a spiritual body is waiting
[1:50:23] you
[1:50:26] on now all those
[1:50:28] things it's one from the supernatural
[1:50:31] the one from
[1:50:33] natural and the other one is from
[1:50:37] superal I explain what I've just read
[1:50:39] amen now in this book it come it
[1:50:43] becometh us to F to fulfill
[1:50:49] righteousness I'm reading paragraph for
[1:50:54] 14 did you ever notice that a little
[1:50:58] baby when it's born it's its little
[1:51:01] muscles twiching and
[1:51:11] checking but when it comes to the
[1:51:15] Earth it receives a
[1:51:18] spirit then it becomes a living soul
[1:51:25] as soon as the soul goes back from that
[1:51:28] little
[1:51:36] body there is another one waiting for
[1:51:40] it because
[1:51:43] first God makes the
[1:51:46] Soul and Spirit it just goes to the body
[1:51:53] and when we leave
[1:51:54] here we only change Dwelling
[1:51:58] Places and go to one and go to another
[1:52:04] one
[1:52:06] right he he went on and read Genesis
[1:52:09] chapter
[1:52:12] 2 said there was no man to te the ground
[1:52:15] you
[1:52:17] know that's why he made that uh at ly
[1:52:26] Body Spirit right I meanly
[1:52:31] image but then and he put the spirit of
[1:52:34] man in the animal
[1:52:44] man he became a living
[1:52:48] Soul now
[1:52:50] because uh he didn't a
[1:52:55] soul now I'm jumping I'm not reading
[1:53:00] everything paragraph 17 says but there
[1:53:03] the differ between the animal and the
[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:09] man he made a soul for a
[1:53:14] man that is a living Soul because the
[1:53:18] spirit of God was in the man
[1:53:22] the spirit of spirit of God was in the
[1:53:26] man then God made a living soul for that
[1:53:33] man are we
[1:53:37] together and as a child you grow
[1:53:41] into being a living
[1:53:47] [Music]
[1:53:50] soul and at the age of of
[1:53:55] choice you share the
[1:53:57] gospel in some
[1:54:00] way and something down inside
[1:54:05] you tells you to receive
[1:54:10] it right
[1:54:13] amen and you say well I'm too
[1:54:18] young I'll wait a little longer
[1:54:22] now there's where you make your first
[1:54:28] mistake because there's something within
[1:54:32] you that tells you and you are
[1:54:36] saying I'm still
[1:54:41] young are for the the old people and old
[1:54:44] women that's that's where you you make
[1:54:48] your first mistake right there
[1:54:54] for you grieve the person inside
[1:54:58] you there's a person
[1:55:02] inside in your soul that's where God
[1:55:07] dwells and he speaks to
[1:55:09] you through that
[1:55:12] soul and then if now that Soul
[1:55:16] says receive the weight and you say you
[1:55:20] still young
[1:55:22] we are grieving that person inside of
[1:55:25] you God's not going to judge
[1:55:29] you no but this man up
[1:55:34] here your
[1:55:38] intellect and he's going to judge you by
[1:55:41] your
[1:55:45] soul right amen because you failed to
[1:55:49] control your spirit
[1:55:57] now it see the Bible says in
[1:55:59] Proverbs
[1:56:03] 2528 we can read
[1:56:07] it you've got a
[1:56:09] spirit you've got your
[1:56:12] soul but you need to control your
[1:56:17] spirit you have the power to control
[1:56:20] your spirit
[1:56:24] because it's
[1:56:25] yours what does it say he that had no
[1:56:30] rule over his own
[1:56:34] spirit it's like a city that is broken
[1:56:39] down and without
[1:56:43] wall when the still Small
[1:56:48] Voice speaks to you listen to to
[1:56:54] that what makes you a
[1:56:56] Believer is that you've got the
[1:57:01] conscience and then that
[1:57:04] conscience tells you that you are
[1:57:08] denying the right of your
[1:57:17] soul listen to what uh the prophet says
[1:57:21] here
[1:57:23] he says
[1:57:25] here I'm reading this book 10
[1:57:30] versions it's paragraph
[1:57:32] 34 he says oh
[1:57:36] no not that constant burden for the lost
[1:57:41] [Music]
[1:57:45] soul don't never let anything rise up
[1:57:50] and put bitterness in your soul
[1:57:56] [Music]
[1:58:00] hear what he
[1:58:01] says don't never let anything rise up
[1:58:05] and put bitterness in your
[1:58:15] soul no matter how bad anyone ever
[1:58:18] treats you
[1:58:23] or
[1:58:24] anything don't
[1:58:29] never don't be guilty of letting that
[1:58:33] thing anchor in your
[1:58:40] soul it will grieve the holy spirit away
[1:58:44] from
[1:58:48] you see it will grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:58:53] yeah
[1:58:54] amen paragraph 85 says amen always keep
[1:58:58] all the roots of bitterness out of
[1:59:08] you no matter what anyone does to
[1:59:15] you just have
[1:59:18] God in there
[1:59:22] that will keep all evil away from
[1:59:30] you so that is why
[1:59:33] now you have to even in in the Book of
[1:59:38] Proverbs chapter 16 verse
[1:59:41] 322 it still says
[1:59:44] that he that that rued his spirits is
[1:59:49] better than he that take it as
[1:59:56] City he that is slow to anger is better
[2:00:00] than the mighty and he that ruleth his
[2:00:03] Spirit than he that taketh a city amen
[2:00:06] he that ruleth his
[2:00:10] Spirit your spirit is
[2:00:12] yours you rule
[2:00:15] it now what why am I reading these
[2:00:20] things I'm sure you I'm showing you that
[2:00:23] now there there
[2:00:25] is uh a a a
[2:00:29] supernal Instinct in
[2:00:37] you right amen of which you can ignore
[2:00:44] it and when you ignore
[2:00:47] it we are grieving the Holy Spirit
[2:00:52] that's the
[2:00:53] thing that is is taking you to the
[2:00:56] quickening of your
[2:01:01] body right amen the prophet
[2:01:05] says Christ
[2:01:08] uh the word I mean Christ is the Living
[2:01:12] Word in
[2:01:15] you when you talk about Christ when he
[2:01:19] says the word is now in the bride
[2:01:24] potentially Christ is in
[2:01:27] you it's not only the
[2:01:30] we The Living
[2:01:33] Way the word is the
[2:01:36] seed the seed is got life in
[2:01:39] it now a
[2:01:42] seed that is not
[2:01:44] planted cannot
[2:01:47] germinate a seed that is
[2:01:50] planted then it need
[2:01:53] germinate it it becomes a living
[2:01:57] weight in
[2:02:00] you that's why the Bible
[2:02:03] says uh it is the
[2:02:06] spirit that Quicken it you see am the
[2:02:10] flesh profited
[2:02:13] nothing it's the
[2:02:15] words that have been

[2:09:53] you know one
[2:09:54] day our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:09:58] said what would you
[2:10:00] see if you see the son of
[2:10:03] man Ascend to where he was
[2:10:08] before we went to go
[2:10:10] there we went to
[2:10:12] ascend to where we were
[2:10:17] before
[2:10:19] together that is why
[2:10:22] what we need is a Ministry it's a sermon
[2:10:27] that will tell
[2:10:28] us about the changing our
[2:10:32] bodies about the quickening of our
[2:10:38] bodies we have done what is
[2:10:40] good everything that is
[2:10:43] good but we know what we
[2:10:48] want right amen we know what we want
[2:10:54] he says the words that I speak to
[2:10:58] you they are
[2:11:01] spirit and they are
[2:11:04] life right
[2:11:06] amen right we are on that
[2:11:09] life let's go again uh yes I'm checking
[2:11:15] time uh let's go to First Corinthians my
[2:11:18] brother just read from verse 46 to 48
[2:11:24] chapter
[2:11:25] 15 First
[2:11:28] Corinthians from verse
[2:11:31] 46 how be that was not
[2:11:34] first how be that was not first which is
[2:11:37] spiritual but that which is natural and
[2:11:41] afterward that which is spiritual the
[2:11:44] first man is of the F earthy the second
[2:11:47] man is the Lord From Heaven s is the e
[2:11:51] such are they also that are earthy and
[2:11:54] as is the Heavenly such are they also
[2:11:57] that are
[2:11:58] Heavenly you
[2:12:00] see that that is what the word
[2:12:04] says it says
[2:12:06] that how be it that was not first which
[2:12:11] is
[2:12:15] spiritual but that but uh that which is
[2:12:19] natural
[2:12:22] like we read uh Genesis
[2:12:28] 2:7 the body was
[2:12:31] made and then the spiritual came
[2:12:36] out you you were born out of your
[2:12:40] parents and then the supernatural
[2:12:44] came that's why you are here that's why
[2:12:48] some other people don't understand why
[2:12:50] you are here
[2:12:53] that's why some other people don't
[2:12:55] understand why do you carry your Bible
[2:12:57] and go to the
[2:13:02] service when they come over here and sit
[2:13:05] and
[2:13:06] listen they can't grasp a
[2:13:09] thing now they wonder what is wrong with
[2:13:15] me you know
[2:13:17] what the Bible said
[2:13:22] I think it's in the book of Acts 13:48
[2:13:25] you don't have to read
[2:13:26] it it speaks about those that were
[2:13:30] ordained for eternal
[2:13:35] life says those that he
[2:13:39] knew he called
[2:13:42] them my sheep hear my
[2:13:46] voice we hear a voice that's why we
[2:13:49] follow
[2:13:52] because it's we're part of
[2:13:54] him when we receive the we we receive
[2:13:58] the part of
[2:13:59] him when it germinate within
[2:14:02] us then we become that way then he's our
[2:14:08] father that's why Jesus Christ said my
[2:14:10] father is in
[2:14:13] me that's why he says I and my father
[2:14:18] one how can you explain that
[2:14:22] not two
[2:14:23] people
[2:14:25] one and that is why the Bible
[2:14:28] says that
[2:14:30] day
[2:14:32] shall that I am in the
[2:14:35] father you in
[2:14:37] me in you that makes you potential
[2:14:44] go it makes you
[2:14:48] one now you can't explain that
[2:14:52] it comes through a
[2:14:55] revelation and if you go to the book of
[2:14:58] Jude verse six says there are those that
[2:15:03] are
[2:15:05] ordained for
[2:15:09] condemnation like
[2:15:12] Judas speak about the
[2:15:15] angels that kept not their first estate
[2:15:23] there are
[2:15:24] people that is difficult for
[2:15:27] them to keep their first
[2:15:32] estate how wonderful it is to worship
[2:15:35] [Music]
[2:15:37] God there's always joy in your heart
[2:15:40] there's always happiness in your heart
[2:15:42] there always protection in your
[2:15:46] heart you speak he answers you speak he
[2:15:49] answers
[2:15:52] without any
[2:15:54] pain but there are some
[2:15:57] people that will get into
[2:16:00] problems and waste lot of
[2:16:04] money and trying to find
[2:16:08] [Music]
[2:16:10] life right that's why
[2:16:13] there it says how be
[2:16:17] it the one that was spiritual
[2:16:23] came the
[2:16:24] second let's read the the 47 the first
[2:16:29] man is the earth an
[2:16:33] earthy the second man is the Lord From
[2:16:37] [Music]
[2:16:39] Heaven he comes through the
[2:16:44] we so now I'm reading here is this is a
[2:16:49] long one the cruel of
[2:16:53] sin and the penalty that it caused Amen
[2:16:59] to read Sin from our lives amen now he
[2:17:03] says he made him out of the Dust of the
[2:17:10] earth not his own
[2:17:13] image he started by saying let us make
[2:17:15] man in our
[2:17:18] agage after our likeness
[2:17:22] that was a
[2:17:24] man that was his
[2:17:27] son that was
[2:17:29] logos that is
[2:17:31] Christ that is why he said Christ
[2:17:35] said your father
[2:17:38] abam saw my day and was
[2:17:44] happy because before he
[2:17:47] was I was
[2:17:50] [Applause]
[2:17:51] now that's where his communication is
[2:17:54] and that's where the bride's
[2:17:56] communication
[2:17:59] is now you are in a
[2:18:02] position where when when Christ says
[2:18:06] before he was I was I
[2:18:11] am now you are in that
[2:18:14] stage you are speaking
[2:18:16] now from your position
[2:18:20] said what would you
[2:18:23] say when you see the son of man
[2:18:27] Ascend to where he was
[2:18:30] before now we're speaking about
[2:18:34] things about a
[2:18:37] place where we were
[2:18:40] before we are talking from that
[2:18:44] position while we are in this
[2:18:47] area that's that is why
[2:18:51] he would say tell no
[2:18:53] one because it's only for the
[2:18:58] Angels only for The
[2:19:01] Supernaturals only for the
[2:19:05] theop you have to be in that
[2:19:10] Dimension while you are in this
[2:19:14] Dimension are we together you speak some
[2:19:19] things that are in another
[2:19:22] dimension while you are in this
[2:19:24] Dimension but you speaking to the
[2:19:28] people that are not in this
[2:19:31] Dimension so the ministry today it's in
[2:19:35] another
[2:19:36] dimension we
[2:19:38] communicate from
[2:19:41] above so that is a pul that's the one
[2:19:44] that will
[2:19:46] P that will bring about now the
[2:19:49] quickening of
[2:19:50] [Music]
[2:19:53] are we
[2:19:54] together may the Lord bless
[2:19:58] [Applause]
[2:20:19] you oh
