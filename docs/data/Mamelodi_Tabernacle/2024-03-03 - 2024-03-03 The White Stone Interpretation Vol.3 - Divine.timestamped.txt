[1:12:06] okay it means
[1:12:08] that this
[1:12:10] name amen has always been there
[1:12:15] because
[1:12:18] because all right
[1:12:21] amen uh
[1:12:24] I don't
[1:12:30] know Rapture they saying that
[1:12:35] Rapture they actually saying it is
[1:12:39] happening this
[1:12:43] year now I haven't mentioned anyone
[1:12:46] talking about this met amen
[1:12:50] amen you know the reason why yeah let's
[1:12:55] because as it
[1:12:57] says in the
[1:13:02] stone okay amen
[1:13:06] now
[1:13:09] Rapture Le is like a a rock a
[1:13:16] stone no the
[1:13:20] people that you can talk to about the
[1:13:22] rapt
[1:13:25] it is the people that are in the Rapture
[1:13:28] amen all right amen
[1:13:34] so we thank
[1:13:37] [Music]
[1:13:41] God we are
[1:13:45] going helping
[1:13:49] us amen that when you come then you will
[1:13:53] be here
[1:13:57] because it's not because we will be
[1:14:01] fast we sleep early in the
[1:14:05] morning and wake up still early amen
[1:14:09] amen
[1:14:11] so this Stone we are going back to the
[1:14:15] stone as our precious brother gabri
[1:14:21] requested so we are
[1:14:24] together we are
[1:14:32] together now I just want to quote a few
[1:14:35] things just to keep time
[1:14:38] and the white stone
[1:14:46] interpretation then so many things to
[1:14:49] come with this Stone there's many things
[1:14:55] that's why my brother was
[1:15:00] concerned let's look at the
[1:15:04] stone
[1:15:09] because because if your name is in the
[1:15:12] Rock and
[1:15:17] then and you read it in the Bible you
[1:15:20] must be
[1:15:22] concerned
[1:15:29] they were singing and they were saying
[1:15:30] and mine is there my name is there my
[1:15:34] name is there so we realize
[1:15:40] that the only
[1:15:45] message you can actually
[1:15:50] believe
[1:15:52] theity
[1:15:53] message there's there's a certain
[1:15:55] message that majority don't believe
[1:15:58] it amen amen
[1:16:03] like instam when I talk about Instagram
[1:16:06] don't believe
[1:16:07] it
[1:16:09] why but
[1:16:15] those those whose names are not found in
[1:16:21] there something when we Cote something
[1:16:26] if your
[1:16:29] life your
[1:16:36] belief but the
[1:16:38] person who is not in that thing he's the
[1:16:42] only one that will believe
[1:16:45] it is that right
[1:16:47] amen now that's
[1:16:51] why when the Bible says let him that is
[1:16:58] filthy do you know the scure it is read
[1:17:01] that
[1:17:04] scripture
[1:17:06] because because this is the time we are
[1:17:08] living
[1:17:10] in I heard the prophet when he was
[1:17:12] quoting
[1:17:15] it the one who is what he is let him
[1:17:19] continue that way
[1:17:22] amen it means that it's a point of no
[1:17:28] return you can't change
[1:17:31] him you can't change
[1:17:37] him Revelation 2 verse
[1:17:42] 11 he that is unjust let him be unjust
[1:17:45] still and he which is filthy let him be
[1:17:49] filthy still and he that is righteous
[1:17:52] let him be righteous still and he that
[1:17:54] is Holy let him be holy still
[1:17:58] amen did you hear the
[1:18:03] prophet when he talks about this this
[1:18:09] scripture
[1:18:11] Sor yes yes all
[1:18:14] right sorry okay
[1:18:20] sir 11 11 11
[1:18:41] says did you hear
[1:18:46] it it says actually in everyone's
[1:18:50] heart he says I I'm continue the
[1:19:09] way right
[1:19:21] amen
[1:19:26] have you heard the prophet talking about
[1:19:28] that's when the door is
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:34] closed it means
[1:19:37] that there is no
[1:19:40] more it's closed

[1:19:50] here together with our brother

[1:29:04] filthy that's only when the door is
[1:29:08] closed
[1:29:11] amen
[1:29:14] and the Mystery of it
[1:29:17] is he that is
[1:29:20] filthy

[1:29:28] himself and he that
[1:29:32] is or he that is righteous amen
[1:29:36] amen

[1:30:17] Believer but
[1:30:20] yet is a
[1:30:23] Believer who is on the
[1:30:27] outside not

[1:30:42] him he doesn't change at
[1:30:48] all when the
[1:30:50] door is cled
[1:30:53] that's why the message comes to that
[1:30:57] person he that is
[1:31:00] filthy anyhow let him
[1:31:03] continue because the door is
[1:31:07] closed it's
[1:31:10] over whether tomorrow he can

[1:32:04] prison I come to a place where the
[1:32:08] prophet of God said the door is
[1:32:15] closed now if if that door is
[1:32:20] closed means that the
[1:32:24] people that
[1:32:26] are

[1:32:40] but not understanding
[1:32:42] that and knowing that the door is
[1:32:50] already all right amen that means it's
[1:32:55] over he that is
[1:32:58] this let him
[1:33:02] continue all right
[1:33:05] amen that's
[1:33:08] why we have reached a point of no
[1:33:16] return
[1:33:19] amen we have arrived
[1:33:23] like me as a
[1:33:25] preacher I Won't Go

[1:34:31] SS in
[1:34:35] prison if you continue doing
[1:34:39] something you are a
[1:34:44] prisoner now that's why the prophet
[1:34:48] say
[1:34:50] Inon
[1:34:52] who will never never any time
[1:34:58] repent the work of the word of God don't
[1:35:01] work for
[1:35:05] them amen amen they are lovers of
[1:35:11] themselves all right
[1:35:13] amen now that's why the Rapture is
[1:35:17] coming but those who are going in the
[1:35:20] rupture
[1:35:24] um you can even see
[1:35:27] them you can recognize
[1:35:31] them how but you can recognize
[1:35:36] them the people that are
[1:35:41] going if you are
[1:35:44] going it's easy to recognize somebody
[1:35:47] who is
[1:35:50] going
[1:35:52] [Music]
[1:35:54] but let me read here and we close
[1:35:58] because it says just do what you are
[1:36:01] doing and carry
[1:36:05] on now the white
[1:36:07] sto H here in this
[1:36:10] book is this the
[1:36:15] time I quote to you
[1:36:18] this where brother Junior's
[1:36:23] dream he said to brother BR struck the
[1:36:27] top of the
[1:36:32] mountain uh ripped it
[1:36:38] around and lifted the cap of it
[1:36:44] off it was in the shape of a
[1:36:50] pyramid uh I will read to you there's so
[1:36:53] many
[1:36:55] pyramids you go to Egypt there's
[1:36:59] pyramids it is going
[1:37:01] to tell us
[1:37:05] about the Pyramid of the White
[1:37:13] Rock amen amen now he's speaking to
[1:37:19] brother you Str top of that
[1:37:24] mountain that's according to his
[1:37:28] dream and RI it
[1:37:33] around and lifted the cap
[1:37:39] of it was in the shape of a
[1:37:44] pyramid amen now that was month and
[1:37:49] month and month before before the
[1:37:51] pyramid message was
[1:37:58] preached and he said beneath
[1:38:03] that was a white
[1:38:08] Stone
[1:38:10] Granite Granite amen amen the Sun or the
[1:38:14] light has never shined on it
[1:38:20] before
[1:38:24] that's
[1:38:25] why there's a time all
[1:38:29] along the Seven Seals the seventh seal
[1:38:33] was not
[1:38:37] revealed amen okay amen but today did
[1:38:42] you know that to the bride of
[1:38:45] Christ it is
[1:38:50] revealed amen amen but to others it is
[1:38:54] still not
[1:38:59] revealed you'll know the reason because
[1:39:03] you have the
[1:39:05] church and the
[1:39:08] bride the church is something
[1:39:11] else the bride is
[1:39:17] something that's why you wonder
[1:39:20] sometimes you find the people in a
[1:39:24] church with with such
[1:39:27] hatred and you wonder how can you
[1:39:30] Worship in such a
[1:39:34] condition can a person who hates his
[1:39:39] brother what did the Bible says
[1:39:42] about he who hates his
[1:39:50] brother
[1:39:55] maybe you don't
[1:39:57] know don't know what is
[1:40:00] hatred amen
[1:40:03] amen you just hear talking about it but
[1:40:07] you don't
[1:40:09] know you know like
[1:40:14] Satan he doesn't know what love is amen
[1:40:18] he's a fallen being
[1:40:22] now a fallen
[1:40:25] being doesn't know when you talk about
[1:40:29] what are you referring
[1:40:33] to the
[1:40:35] nature in him what love is doesn't know
[1:40:39] what is
[1:40:41] love okay amen now let's look at this
[1:40:45] the white
[1:40:49] stone amen amen given
[1:40:54] to over an
[1:40:57] overcomer amen all right

[1:54:52] we used to sing
[1:54:55] [Music]
[1:54:59] chorus it speaks of the
[1:55:01] rock I will remember it I will sing it
[1:55:05] for
[1:55:12] you rock coming from the
[1:55:15] mountain who's that
[1:55:18] k
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:35] The
[1:55:36] Rock from the
[1:55:39] mountain he saw it rolling
[1:55:43] down MH amen okay amen now here it
[1:55:48] says
[1:55:50] and on the
[1:55:54] inside was White
[1:55:58] Rock not just a
[1:56:01] rock
[1:56:07] white you see in your heart as member of
[1:56:12] the
[1:56:15] Bride what is the color there
[1:56:22] amen the original
[1:56:24] color not mixed with the things of the
[1:56:29] world just pure
[1:56:34] white it's a
[1:56:36] place where God
[1:56:42] dwells all right amen a true true a True
[1:56:47] Believer this morning
[1:56:51] is somebody who can open his
[1:56:56] [Music]
[1:56:57] heart for God's Dwelling
[1:57:06] Place all right amen what is in your
[1:57:12] heart every morning whatever we are
[1:57:17] doing you open your heart
[1:57:20] either for Satan to come and do his
[1:57:24] things or you open your
[1:57:27] heart for God to
[1:57:29] come it depends what's in your
[1:57:36] heart but you have open your heart for
[1:57:45] somebody now there's two different
[1:57:48] natures
[1:57:50] one is of God one is of the enemy
[1:57:56] Satan which nature do you
[1:58:03] enjoy what is in your
[1:58:05] heart what are you thinking
[1:58:10] about all right
[1:58:13] amen not a church go but a jeer of your
[1:58:18] way
[1:58:20] amen
[1:58:21] amen not the church member but a doer of
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:30] your not just a singer but AER you see
[1:58:36] is the doer of the
[1:58:39] way now the doer of the
[1:58:42] way
[1:58:44] is somebody with nature of
[1:58:48] God
[1:58:51] because the word is
[1:58:54] God God is a doer of his own
[1:59:00] way now if in
[1:59:04] you God he is a doer of his own
[1:59:12] way amen amen if there's another
[1:59:17] nature in you it will
[1:59:21] defy the nature of
[1:59:23] God so in you what nature is in
[1:59:28] you which
[1:59:31] nature is it of the white
[1:59:34] stone I will read it to you
[1:59:37] here this white stone was
[1:59:43] introduced amen
[1:59:48] but no
[1:59:52] man can
[1:59:54] himself put
[1:59:58] nature in
[2:00:01] himself so it is only God who can
[2:00:07] change how does God change
[2:00:12] somebody that's when he gives him a
[2:00:17] white stone amen
[2:00:23] amen and this
[2:00:26] person he knows
[2:00:28] [Music]
[2:00:29] himself who he
[2:00:34] is amen I can tell you
[2:00:38] that uh if I I were to
[2:00:42] ask this young
[2:00:44] people because most of
[2:00:46] them are the worshippers of the cell
[2:00:52] phone cell
[2:00:54] phone in their
[2:00:59] souls day and
[2:01:01] night they are
[2:01:04] worshippers of the cell
[2:01:06] phone you can talk the way you
[2:01:09] like
[2:01:13] change because it is only
[2:01:16] God who has changed our nature
[2:01:20] amen a divine
[2:01:24] nature as Peter says he has given us
[2:01:29] divine
[2:01:31] nature now you must thank
[2:01:33] God for that divine nature
[2:01:38] in amen amen because you don't receive
[2:01:43] it through a
[2:01:44] prayer it is God by
[2:01:48] predestination
[2:01:51] God has predestinated
[2:01:54] you to come and live in
[2:01:59] you nature in
[2:02:01] you is not your own
[2:02:03] nature divine nature is God's
[2:02:08] nature in
[2:02:10] you
[2:02:12] amen amen amen so that's why let me read
[2:02:18] this
[2:02:20] and on the
[2:02:24] inside of
[2:02:26] it was White
[2:02:30] Rock This is
[2:02:34] SS I mean standing in the Gap standing
[2:02:37] in the Gap M
[2:02:40] amen one of the things that
[2:02:45] really people cannot understand
[2:02:50] standing in
[2:02:54] there you know you ask which
[2:03:00] G
[2:03:03] because when man fuled his
[2:03:10] position
[2:03:13] God God will
[2:03:16] never change his plan
[2:03:21] if it should be a man in
[2:03:29] the if it is a man who should keep the
[2:03:36] book If this
[2:03:40] man
[2:03:44] fori God has to restore it again
[2:03:50] otherwise it would mean
[2:03:53] that God has
[2:03:58] failed all right
[2:04:00] amen
[2:04:02] uh that's why the bright is the
[2:04:07] original
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:12] Church the original church is called the
[2:04:15] bride of
[2:04:17] Christ
[2:04:21] and because it is
[2:04:24] original if every
[2:04:27] time like it is God who came who comes
[2:04:31] to this
[2:04:34] bride to fulfill his
[2:04:38] word you must remember that I cannot
[2:04:42] fulfill the word of
[2:04:45] God through
[2:04:47] predestination comes and fulfill his
[2:04:52] way in you because he has
[2:05:00] predestinated you know
[2:05:02] he's responsible for
[2:05:05] that when
[2:05:08] Adam left his
[2:05:11] place because
[2:05:13] originally it was given from
[2:05:17] God God has
[2:05:22] close but how it should be
[2:05:26] men
[2:05:28] again he brings men
[2:05:31] back to the
[2:05:35] Gap if not that would mean God has
[2:05:39] failed if there is no
[2:05:42] restoration that would mean God has
[2:05:46] fa that's why there's a law of
[2:05:51] to
[2:05:52] restore amen amen after Satan has caused
[2:05:57] a
[2:05:59] damage the Lord God came back to
[2:06:06] redeem to
[2:06:07] redeem take it back
[2:06:12] again because if it is not taken
[2:06:15] back that means God has lost
[2:06:22] amen amen so we were in him for the
[2:06:27] foundation of the

[2:32:59] nature amen what I mean
[2:33:02] is what I am receiving
[2:33:06] here I can live without
[2:33:10] it amen that's why you can't
[2:33:14] survive in any other
[2:33:17] church because you don't need a
[2:33:21] church
[2:33:25] him
[2:33:28] amen so that's
[2:33:30] why your nature puts
[2:33:35] you you
[2:33:39] belong the nature in you will always put
[2:33:43] you where you
[2:33:45] belong
[2:33:47] the nature of God will put you in
[2:33:52] God it is of the world will put you in
[2:33:56] the things of the
[2:33:57] world and they will pass
[2:34:01] away the things of the world they come
[2:34:05] but they will pass away but the person
[2:34:09] without divine
[2:34:10] nature amen amen he is also
[2:34:14] saying if
[2:34:17] the things that I'm doing will pass away
[2:34:21] I rather pass
[2:34:23] away I'll pass away with them there's
[2:34:26] people who can live without the word of
[2:34:32] God and there are some people who cannot
[2:34:36] live
[2:34:38] without doing what they
[2:34:41] are amen but their life is so
[2:34:47] [Music]

[2:35:01] for
[2:35:01] the
[2:35:03] St a sister asked me one
[2:35:08] time she said to

[2:35:13] me
[2:35:15] uh
[2:35:16] what is that cycle of
[2:35:23] darkness and I
[2:35:26] said which

[2:36:08] Judas it is
[2:36:14] better
[2:36:16] let me hear again
[2:36:23] Jesus it was better if such a man was
[2:36:26] not
[2:36:30] born that's
[2:36:33] terrible
[2:36:35] if the Lord Jesus says that
[2:36:39] himself it was
[2:36:44] better that that's
[2:36:47] meaning that is that
[2:36:50] means his judgment is
[2:36:56] terrible it is better if the man
[2:37:04] was for the Lord to say
[2:37:07] that now I said to the
[2:37:10] sister do you know about the the

[2:38:44] of
[2:38:46] then I spoke to a brother about
[2:38:51] it is then I realized
[2:38:54] that she operated
[2:38:58] there but after she told me about
[2:39:02] that I saw that a
[2:39:04] [Music]
[2:39:06] cycle down there only to realize that
[2:39:10] she's operating
[2:39:12] there and I remember she took us with
[2:39:17] some
[2:39:18] brothers to the same
[2:39:20] place when we were asking her about
[2:39:25] some amen amen and uh she asked one
[2:39:31] day many a
[2:39:33] time is is God going to judge
[2:39:39] me like I
[2:39:43] W elaborate
[2:39:46] but she said is God going to judge
[2:39:50] you he mentioned
[2:39:53] somebody like
[2:39:55] that and then we said if you don't
[2:40:01] repent yes he's going to judge
[2:40:04] you but if you can
[2:40:08] repent then God is
[2:40:14] merciful then
[2:40:16] we went to the same
[2:40:19] place where I've seen that
[2:40:23] Cy because she told me about the
[2:40:26] cycle a huge one now when I went there I
[2:40:31] saw a cycle and I was told that she
[2:40:36] operates
[2:40:39] here and there one she came
[2:40:44] here
[2:40:46] when I talked
[2:40:49] about what is it what was
[2:40:54] it was it yeah think so
[2:40:58] yes just after that somebody arrived
[2:41:04] here with a
[2:41:09] container only to
[2:41:13] realize you know brother we realize
[2:41:16] that she
[2:41:17] wanted to come to the
[2:41:23] pool because when we were talking
[2:41:27] here she was
[2:41:33] at then while we were talking she
[2:41:37] started
[2:41:38] coming because their
[2:41:42] plans
[2:41:43] were stopped
[2:41:47] God that
[2:41:50] day when we were told that there's Judas
[2:41:55] here he has come to
[2:41:59] kill amen amen then when she
[2:42:03] arrived she was from that
[2:42:08] place coming
[2:42:11] here she wanted
[2:42:14] water
[2:42:16] that's why I said to the
[2:42:18] brothers clean the
[2:42:22] pool because something
[2:42:27] happened and they cleans the
[2:42:30] pool and we told the people you cannot
