[42:25] scripture but I'm going to
[42:30] United I'm going to read The Book of
[42:33] Proverbs Chapter
[42:38] 19 Verse 14 verse
[42:44] 14 Proverbs Chapter 19
[42:48] ver14 house and riches are the
[42:51] inheritance of fathers and a Prudent
[42:54] Wife is from the Lord
[43:11] let us close our eyes as we
[43:14] pray our heavenly
[43:18] father standing I here with my brother
[43:23] yes in front of this company
[43:29] we are coming to
[43:32] thee approaching this holy
[43:37] ceremony we are besing thee humbly to
[43:40] come and be with
[43:41] us as we run this
[43:44] ceremony help us
[43:46] Lord because we don't have anything to
[43:49] do we don't have power the power is from
[43:53] you we are asking all this in the
[43:55] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[43:57] Jesus Christ
[43:59] amen we may take our
[44:07] seats as as I've
[44:11] said I'm not going to be too
[44:16] long I'm going to T
[44:21] to but the Bible where I have
[44:25] read he said
[44:29] house and
[44:31] riches are the inheritance of the
[44:39] fathers in other words
[44:42] father can give you a
[44:47] house it is what he
[44:50] [Music]
[44:52] can and he can he can give you riches
[44:55] [Music]
[44:57] but
[45:04] they she must be from the he must be a
[45:07] gift from the
[45:13] Lord God is still giving people
[45:20] wives just from just like in the
[45:25] beginning it was not a ad's
[45:29] Choice it was God's
[45:33] choice is God who put Adam to a deep
[45:41] sleep and from he took
[45:46] a he produced the wife from
[45:53] ad not
[45:58] but God
[46:00] himself he said the man shall leave his
[46:08] parents and cling to his
[46:13] wife it was
[46:17] God Abraham knew this
[46:20] thing you knew that a wife must come
[46:24] from God
[46:28] when he wanted the wife for his
[46:35] son he had to choose from his
[46:42] household The Trusted
[46:45] [Music]
[46:49] Serv not any other
[46:53] seven but the trusted one
[46:58] because this
[46:59] issue it is the issue of
[47:02] God it's not man's
[47:04] issue he said I must choose the
[47:10] trusted and he made that seven to
[47:16] say he
[47:18] said even though I'm s
[47:22] you but the angel of
[47:25] God is the one will take direct will
[47:28] lead
[47:30] you you are not going to walk alone
[47:34] there because this
[47:37] issue is the issue of
[47:40] God it's not me to
[47:43] see but it's God who must
[47:48] choose that's why the Bible here says
[47:50] you can give your children whatever you
[47:52] want to give them
[47:59] but a Prudent
[48:02] Wife must be a gift from
[48:07] God
[48:11] Amen
[48:13] read Proverbs
[48:16] 18:22
[48:19] 18:22 who so findeth a wife findeth a
[48:22] good thing and obtaineth favor of the
[48:25] Lord
[48:39] it's not easy to find a
[48:44] woman to
[48:46] find you must be
[48:50] [Music]
[48:52] given is it not it is not from you
[48:58] you cannot say i' I've managed to choose
[49:00] the right
[49:02] [Music]
[49:05] woman but it must be from
[49:12] God brother Bram
[49:15] says the best thing God can give to a
[49:23] man besid salvation
[49:28] is a good
[49:32] woman in other way a
[49:36] woman it must be from
[49:40] God you must get him from
[49:46] God even if the prophet
[49:51] says the choice is yours
[49:56] man has the right to
[50:00] choose a woman has the right to
[50:06] accept they got the right to say no or
[50:12] yes
[50:13] but it must be from
[50:20] God
[50:22] Amen you must get hair from God
[50:28] not from a
[50:31] magistrate not from your
[50:34] parents but from
[50:37] god a woman is just part of a
[50:43] man and when a man takes to himself a
[50:50] wife if she is correctly
[50:58] a God given
[51:01] wife are you together with it must be
[51:09] God not
[51:12] parents not
[51:21] friend if if she is correctly his wife
[51:29] a
[51:31] wife she will be just to him as part of
[51:40] him if you are given her by
[51:46] God because from the
[51:51] beginning Eve was part of Adam
[51:56] God gives you a
[51:59] wife he will give you part of
[52:04] you she will never give you another
[52:07] man's
[52:10] P she will give you he will give you
[52:13] your
[52:16] part because he knows which part is am
[52:26] amen are you together with
[52:31] us it must be god-given
[52:37] she
[52:39] says
[52:41] notice now the woman got her
[52:46] place she is a jewel
[52:57] he he said that Solomon
[53:01] said that a man that is found a
[53:06] wife has found a good
[53:10] thing he said a good woman is a jewel in
[53:15] his
[53:23] crown that is an honor
[53:28] but an unrighteous
[53:31] one is water in his
[53:38] blood is the one who you are you were
[53:42] given by your
[53:45] parent is one who you have chosen
[53:49] yourself is one who you is chosen by
[53:53] your friend
[53:57] it will be it will be water
[54:05] blood but the one who is given to you by
[54:12] God it will be a
[54:17] crown read for me my brother
[54:20] there Proverbs chapter 12
[54:28] let's read from verse one verse
[54:32] one who so loveth instruction loveth
[54:35] knowledge but he that hateth reprove is
[54:40] brutish one
[54:56] the one who loves
[55:01] instruction love
[55:04] knowledge because they say when you
[55:06] approach
[55:09] marriage you must have been
[55:16] adved but if you have refused those
[55:23] adves you have refused the knowledge
[55:28] it depends where did you get
[55:31] [Music]
[55:34] ADV because you can't get advices from
[55:41] everybody you have got a
[55:44] parent is your

[55:51] this this big thing
[55:56] you must
[55:59] V from your
[56:02] parent get
[56:05] advice then you will take a good
[56:11] direction but if you just go through
[56:14] your
[56:16] friends if you use your
[56:20] eyes
[56:22] sometimes your eyes will be used by a
[56:25] sep
[56:32] just like people in

[56:43] by because what the serpent has
[56:48] used what found through
[56:53] the is UN raous woman
[56:57] your marriage Will Never
[57:01] Last it didn't last
[57:04] there and it never last
[57:09] here because it it started in a wrong
[57:16] fooding verse two verse two a good man
[57:20] obtaineth favor of the Lord but a man of
[57:23] wicked devices will he condemn
[57:33] if a
[57:35] sister found this type of a
[57:41] man in
[57:45] trouble her marriage will be held here
[57:47] on
[57:53] Earth verse three three
[57:56] a man shall not be established by
[57:59] wickedness but the road of the righteous
[58:01] shall not be
[58:09] moved we cannot call you
[58:14] Rous if the rightous one is not in
[58:21] you and if the Rous one is in you
[58:27] the sep will never get
[58:32] chance but if the rious one is not in
[58:36] you then the serpent will always
[58:43] take verse four verse four a virtuous
[58:46] woman is a crown to her husband but she
[58:49] that maketh ashamed is as rotness in his
[58:53] bones m
