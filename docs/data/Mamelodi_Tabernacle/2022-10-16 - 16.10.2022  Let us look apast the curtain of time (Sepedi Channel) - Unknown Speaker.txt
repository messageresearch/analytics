TRANSCRIPT
========================================
suitable [Music] [Music] oh things are possible [Music] that is her name is Sunday morning Sunday I want to greet my pastors the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen the pastor asked me to wait a bit in the car and so but they I wanted to come and acclamatize when you start singing in here the Saints are singing I get that slammatized so may the Lord bless you all right amen I have for years I've been telling the people that Malawi is my second home [Music] amen and every time I see a abusa and then we've been together for many many years and really I'm glad to be here with them I know one day we will meet and never to a part God bless you one day I was in Mozambique foreign [Music] you just see the sayings and I I love that place the jungles of Africa God bless you at home usually I always ask for a tag with a time for me to wrap up um or so I don't know [Music] [Laughter] okay okay but should should there be something a pasta will always say brother yeah but I want to say I'm glad to be here tough for me really to prepare scenaries but when I found the pastor I realized that no I must go and deal with the pastor there you know he spoke to me like an eagle and I was really much touched I said to the elders there let me go to attend the wedding with the pastor there are other things we will see and God will have his way I don't know oh yes okay now uh we I'm just going to open a scripture by God's grace and and I believe that God will bless us richly as he has been blessing you yeah we are all equal to God Amen and so uh let us borrow his but let me ask my pastor here A word of prayer before the opening of the as we bow our heads up [Music] Department videos foreign [Music] [Music] is amen amen ities foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign God bless you open from The Book of Revelation chapter 4 verse 1. this one to two to two verse 1 D2 are you ready brother God bless you God bless you ready chapter one chapter relation chapter 4 verse 1 to 2.2 after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I had was escrow of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show these things which must be here after and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne is God bless you you may be seated it because I'm just looking at this you know subject today since This is the End of Time and we see all the signs uh brother Brennan told us a lot of time about the king about King of the North profession [Music] now what is happening is what the prophet has spoken of and it has started in this way but it is coming after the Rapture this is [Music] so after the Rapture they will see the fullness of it a battle called and there's another one called the battle of Armageddon which will be fought also after tribulation period that one will be fought by the sayings did you know that we as the children of God are an army okay you know we are the army of God this Army chosen out of the seven Church ages yeah I think the bad brother has pulled that towards is it south or north or east I don't know if we have can everybody see this yes now we we remember here our pyramid is installed it's big but pyramid we remember here we have six Church ages five four three two one amen amen six six but all of this Church ages asleep amen amen although we mentioned them but they are not with us they are in the sixth Dimensions they are asleep now I'm going to take it from the prophet here our subject he says when he says let us look a past the curtain of time now we should know that our ministry started not in 19 so and so but before the foundation of the world because this saving chair changes it is time we it is time seven days it's called time ages you have done past the ages we have passed all these days and we're talking with the children of God about what do we call the seventh Church age pertaining to as our time says you will see your time in the pyramid where you are somewhere in this age now all this all of them are asleep and you have select God has selected out of every age what we call the Overcomers do you have an eraser is here or what do you call it can you put for me here the over this sixth ages we have these are all Overcomers down here the Bible says selected out of each age out of this age has overcome us out of this age there's Overcomers like maybe I can read part of it yeah my brother who can be able to do it is can you or the brother read out this this okay Revelation chapter 3 verse if you can speak a bit aloud Revelation chapter 3 verse 12 if you guess 21 a bit allowed chapter 3 verse 21 Revelation chapter 3 verse 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my room even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his room right he that Overcomers which age 12. him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city in my God which is the New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name is so there you have he that overcometh he that overcometh he that overcome seven years out of each age there is some Overcomers each age produced twins those who overcame were selected and set aside but now in our age we are the living ones as the Bible says foreign foreign [Music] foreign now from the book yeah let me start where do I get this what it is about subjects it says page 103 in this one he says but now in this Sevenfold book of seals of redemption that the Lord took within himself now we are much careful every time when we come to this party because the Bible says the lamb took the book from the one who sat on the throne no Prophet speaking here the Lord took took within the book within himself now it is very much a understood because Jesus says of his father Jesus when they ask him where is your father my father is where you know meaning that the one who had the book on the throne was in him I think it's just too clear and open foreign because he says the first Throne was in heaven the second was in Jesus that's where the third Throne is still one Throne of God Elisha understood that the throne was in Elijah Elijah can't you have a fellowship with us here we are also Brothers he said no as a man but we followed the throne my brother it is in the book here foreign okay okay now here we are we are now I read this part here yes our subject is coming from a minute the book of seals of redemption that the lamp took within himself was the only one who who could do that could do it and he took it from the right hand of him that set upon the throne now to clean Redemptive in the Rapture you can do that brother yes foreign we need to to find the book and because our names are in these books a future home without the cover page it says to claim for me and you could play he redeemed us from really uh back to everything that Adam Lost Boys you know God they can't lose a battle everything that he we have lost he he has redeemed us back to that series my brother that book is without the cover yes thank you all right I mean forgive me I'm sorry I left this in the back okay now here we are now with the lamp with the book in his hands the book was in the hands it is called the book of redemption and and we are ready to assist grace and mercy upon us to open the seventh seal book to us to open the book in Order then he says and let us look at past the curtain of time before we were put in the body there was no starting point now you were created your body your spirit was processed your spirit was not created but your body was created so as he says God in the book who is this melchized [Music] God dwells with his attributes with these attributes alone it is his mind that is saying Amen to God why the mind is saying amen because the mind is the mind of God and it was there in God if God says something that mind it says amen because the mind was in him that's why some people cannot say Amen to this message because the message is the mind of God manifested because their mind that is manifested can say Amen you know the first Epistle of John chapter one chapter one that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life right foreign [Music] [Music] foreign that is our title foreign [Music] the book or the title Deeds of the Mysteries to bring them to his amen [Music] all right we know let's put this a bit here now I'm going back to our scripture the voice said to him here that's in your Bible Revelation chapter 4 verse I will show you things to come now sobano I think this page 92 in this series books in this Vision Vision in another Vision it is in page 92. shall I read it brother I have read it standing up here in heaven being lifted up now from the church ages when he cried out it was from the church Ages come up here from the church ages he has been lifted up Joy yeah come up here is a place from here I will show you which you cannot see unless you come up yes the things I want to show you cannot be seen from where you are you need to come up here I don't mean here in salima he was standing somewhere over here all right then from here I will show you things to come on I think Revelation chapter is it chapter 9. I mean 21 verse 9. and they came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife foreign and then he showed him what yeah verse 10 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God um he showed me a great City but he said the bride is made like the city the city Resurrection people they will reside on the outside the of the city they won't be in the cities and the Bible says they shall come in out in out but they will never recite them all right God bless you uh the bride now I'm looking at this all right I'll carry on come up here I will show you the bride and he led him to air high mountains to show him the bride I repeat the results the bride is built like the city that's why he says the pyramid now who is coming to a sharp points and that's why we are in the minority did you know that you're in the minority now we are not about talking about the the message churches we are talking about the pride amen amen from where I come from we have messages the bread is not in pieces the bright is the word of God I mean you can chop it into pieces we have here seven pieces of the Bride foreign [Music] God unfolding until he he was a man among men foreign Genesis all right so so we are looking at this let me read I I haven't finished and John in the spirit the revelation of the Seven Seals page 90. the revelation of the civilizations he's just being lifted up now from the church ages and you see he saw Church ages and then he was taken up um because he said I will show you the bride the Lamb's wife now for few moments God typed this with Abraham the Bible says we are the Seed of Abraham and the Seed of Abraham is Christ have you ever read that Galatians Colossians chapter 3 verse 16 now to Abraham and his seat where the promise made he said not to the to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ right now amen amen Abraham we have the bride some are yes the bride of Christ [Music] the bride amen amen God who has got not many wives uh what do you call it distribution was there before even Moses allowed them remember when the Lord Jesus arrived he said he who made them made them husband and wives did they say wives because of the hardness of their hearts Moses allowed them to take wives because you you always see a long queue of men coming to complain at the office of Moses [Music] next Moses would say next amen amen again until maybe they are fifty hundred and so 100. if they are 50 the man has got 50 problems you you take 50 wives That's why God gave you only one even his wife all right now yeah I can't talk about the other things in other doctrines yeah we are a family talking of the things that God has allotted we are the father family because a brother came to me from another country and said where brother godima is it wrong to take the second wife I said brother I will take the second one the day the Lord has taken the second one as long as he has the bride then I have the bride is but I said I don't interfere in some other people's uh doctrines I know I preached somewhere I thought I was preaching against sinus running around with women and then I realized afterwards no longer wanted in that area because of that I know it very well yes I don't want to see me again but I was not talking against any person you know sometimes you know a brother was preaching or complaining amen he's preaching about me but actually you you aimed at the Devil yeah so they don't want to see me and yeah as long as I am sin of God I was reading to the children of God a scripture where for uh foreign foreign you know that is the token yeah of the Covenant the token of the Covenants and chapter 9 of Genesis I will put a bow in the sky and I will look upon the ball yes then I will forgive my people so God did not look at them if I'm found to be in Christ that's where God can see if you are in Christ God can see you we are in Christ Jesus Christ called from before the foundation of the world foreign because we we are the Seed of Abraham according to the word of God all right the throne the Throne of God he brought forth a sign and in this pyramid more pyramid is seven steps Yahoo foreign from Adam is your seventh man from Adam now if you look at these numbers like you take the pyramid itself the man who raised that structure is Enoch structures amen he was responsible for the structure the pyramid s and in the pyramidity you have some shaft pointing out to zodiac oh now it is now when they studied that they saw that whoever was responsible for the pyramid he received his measurements from Zodiacs that's why scientists today cannot build a pyramid because the measurements were received from Zodiac Zodiac Zodiac each of the shaft if they look through that shaft is pointing out to a certain stars because the stars are preachers working now the pyramids this is seven steps another very important thing is and even scientists today they cannot interpret the pyramids now when the seventh man from Paul Adam was the seventh from Adam messenger from Paul brother now are we together I don't know what happened okay while you are going back let me put it to you was the seventh man from Adam s responsible for the structure but the interpretation of the uh pyramid came with pyramid because that one is the seventh from adamant okay okay God bless you now we are in the seventh Church age this seventh church I will read to you you know I have read that before you you will always read with me these things oh I am returning to the book of rapture uh you know brother did you know that the seventh Church age is the only church age left the other Church ages that are appearing and we are talking about them and they're missing Messengers are in the sixth dimensions I think the brother is still going to think about it because so he will find us from Adam yes he says Noah but you know the prophet is talking about Adam yeah but which was type of the church ages six men before him died there's no doubt in the seventh Church we are waiting for them we just paid them a visit Dimensions you know we like the messenger who went before we are the writers followed the men who went in before even Moses met God before then he went to the children of Israel I have met God now he has the news from God [Music] I mean I'm talking about this one now who else who went in first what do you mean the bride as I was with Moses amen as I was with Moses so shall I be with you foreign to the Eagle's Nest inside amen to tell them that the seals are open amen amen he goes in first because as a pasta that's why we are told in the olden days a Shepherd did not come from did what did not work behind the ship pardon pardon let me not uh the shepherdisha you'll remind me today how they do it the shepherd is behind it in the olden days the shepherd did not push the Sheep Musa that's why Jesus says [Music] God bless you yes now we are on track now I am the way now the way you don't follow you and he says I am the shepherd a good one too it's something else that's why today you know a Shepherd would know if he had 50 ships you will count 50. is that how it works they followed the Shepherds because it is the shepherd Chicago and see whether it is free to lead the ship in or Not by the time he arrives I mean if he goes behind hey you must help me if I'm I'm going astray if they go foreign is I'm losing this is the last time Enoch was raptured I was showing that it is the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture foreign [Music] because they are there paid them a visit he was told when you want to see the other side says and he says there was no yesterday then we were all he finds himself also being young and that place but they are waiting for us that he said I want to see Jesus one day he will come and he will come and together with him we will come down you know I think it is visible we we are the seventh Church age let us go our past Decatur of times is also foreign ers seals are open he says let us go our past that's where the whole thing separated I am saying you are here in the if you are here in the seventh Church age and their sales are opened up let us go our past what does that means amen pardon me I'm sorry you are a twin being where now or you are foreign you get what I mean that's why evenly you've got the seven churchages when he was on his way uh to to the new city he started off for the new city while he was here is in you [Music] um started to walk towards he was already uh what what we call it rupturing faith means that you have already started [Music] he started towards the Chariot he was in the rapturing wrong to the Rapture in faith he has picked up already on the supernatural while he was here while we are working we have already picked up on the supernatural amen amen you remember the other day in Swaziland or Swaziland I picked up that part where brother Branham says referring to Revelation chapter 21. behold the Tabernacle of God is with men then he comes to look I want rich or foreign Mommy the Tabernacle of God is with men meaning because he says I will I shall wipe off their tears I shall he shall walk with us talk with us why power of our tears now since the people have known God to be a spirit um they have known good to be a spirit the children of Israel when he woman yeah they wanted to worship him when he is a Spirit the people still like that but Heaven is coming down actually we we are not now going up the app is coming down and people are refusing my brother to see them take residence and the Bible says he shall wipe away our tears if you want to work or hand in hand with him you'll be working hand in hand with him a residents maybe if I can just read it and leave it there [Music] Heaven has come down that is Page 55. future homes day honor God comes down to resident upon the Earth Revelation chapter 21. you will be here with us that you will see Jesus with your own eyes [Music] look into his face face to face he will be like like a residence he will be a resident with us the day I'm waiting foreign [Music] we love amen amen I'm so happy but let me stop with this join me brother as we ask our pastor to come forward or our brother will help us to clear the table when they shoot up to shower okay I believe I will meet you again before
