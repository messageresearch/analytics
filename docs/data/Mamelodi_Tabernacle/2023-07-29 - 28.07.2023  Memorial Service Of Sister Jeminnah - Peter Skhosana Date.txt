TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and and make a man are we together anymore so Abraham Abraham was looking for a seat but when he was looking for receipts I'm saying there is something within him that was looking for a city and then when he arrived in the promised land and then the angel of the Lord came to him even Elohim himself right there was a time where he gave him a promise to a young man but now when he left home he was looking for a city a child no he was looking for a city gave him a child Isaac you know about it and then but still within himself he was looking for a city that is why most people they have this question is told to sacrifice his son he took his son and walked for almost three days what happened what would have happened if there was no Lambda would he really killed him and sacrifice him definitely because what he was doing our Sinners deal it was within himself there was something that was driving him [Music] that will give him a satisfaction the promise was go to the promised land and then what was he going to do to the promises to receive a promise now what was that promise it's a city yes it was not only the Sun but but it was the city then that's the only thing that could satisfy Abraham that is why when he met the the the prince of that scene he was satisfied are waiting for the changing of ours while we were waiting for the changing of our boys nobody will tell you whether you have seen that thing happening to you [Applause] you're the only one that knows whatever that you have Rich perfection uh [Music] the Lord himself comes through a predestination so now if it comes through a privilege let me put it this way we know all of us that we have we are hearing three uh we have got we've got body soul and Spirits now the Book of Job Booker job I think it's a in chapter 32 82 verse 8 if not 8 32 yes it says that there is a spirit in a man that's it and then that's the inspiration of God uses that Spirit and the Bible says I believe sorry let me let me read these scriptures so what what is happening here each and every preacher knows very well the difference so we all know that our sister he has just Departed and if you use the word department or he is asleep and then when he's asleep it definitely will woke up soon you see I mean so one that was the one that is dead is the one that will never meet God again God has turned his back against him and then because he was not in the plan of course so the one that is asleep like like uh that's our sister loved certain songs uh actually when the pastors preach about the Rapture the process of going she was also in that process of course together I mean and of course we know that when things like this happen we know that we we've got two kingdoms the kingdom of darkness and the kingdom of light and we've got different worlds the Bible says there's a new world that is coming [Music] and then the new heaven that is we have different bodies we are in this body here on Earth but when we departure recipe we go into another body we go and wait and then when the time comes for the resurrection and then when I say we're going wait we wait for the coming of the Lord because when the Lord comes there will be a resurrection so our sister will come back and then take a minute her soul peace a spirit will come and combine with his spirit and took the body then it will be herself then from there on then you she will change that point when that body changes look we have this terrestrial body and when we depart we put you on another boy which is Celestial is which you are going to wait with that but in the resurrection then comes the changing of the body and when that body changes then we put on now the glorified he's not going to appear as you saw him when she departed come home we know that she will be a young one [Music] you won't know me because I will be 21 years old [Applause] are we together anymore so now that is not a fake it's true that is why the Bible says within us there is a treasure are we together I mean you receive the word of God by faith because the Bible says Divine promises our promises they are Divine promises when the word of God proceeds it touches the Divine look look we are Ordinary People right but now in order that okay God is divine and his word is divine and all that we should be like God we need to change nature because the Bible says we need to have a divine nature we say God is in heaven and we are here God is divine we are natural now being natural in order to be like God we need to change to be like him now what is going to change us the very same word that you hear is going to form a being within you want to support yourself it will be a supernatural that's why now when you are waiting for the coming of them actually what is waiting for the coming of God is the being that is within you there's something within you that craves for the changes are we together now if there's something within you here that has germinated like actually the Bible says without faith God is not happy about you you receive the word by faith and when you receive the word by faith and then you start now that way it becomes it starts germinating then you receive the virtue because in this field Paul says yes there is waiting for a son and then now in order to receive that son the body must change are we together we are expecting a son are we together there should be somebody within us we are called the bright we are the bride carrying out in our Lord Jesus Christ Our Lord is a groom now we have to give pets [Applause] we have to give birth century are we together now the word must germinate to a Perfection when now he comes to fetch his bride he's not going to fetch this uh he's going to fetch the supernatural that is Supernatural that is in you the one that will bring about the changing of your questions foreign [Applause] right but I want us to go to First Corinthians chapter 15. now I'm talking now about the changing of the food you should know your inheritance you should know what God has promised you don't just worship because people are worshiping exactly what you want yeah it says a lot of people they don't know what they want they don't know what are they expecting are we together so you should know what you are expecting there's been a lot of things that are are passing by do you remember Elijah was in a cave so while he was in the cave there was a things that were passing by but that never shook Elijah because he knew what he was waiting Corinthians chapter 15. yeah always we read that scripture when okay let's start from verse 22. 2 verse 22 said for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all he made alive foreign let's go on to I'll come back to this one let's jump over to verse 45 45. verse 45 said and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul s last Adam was made a quickening spirit and if you go to John 6 63 John 6 63 it says it is the spirit that quickeneth opener right the Lost Adam was made a quickening spirit now when it says it's a quickening spirit it means you receive something that is quickening your life she will move from Faith from all those virtues until you get a quickening power to cross over together now a quickening power has to do with the changing of the body that is in process it's like like always when the pastor preaches about the plane that is on on the running word it's something that is in process so the thing that is born within you one day is the very same thing that is going to change [Applause] now that's what we call Resurrection Resurrection does not happen with it it does not happen automatically when the Resurrection comes you won't feel surprised no it's a thing that is in you are together I mean now right now we have different Ministries different dispensations let me explain it it was a time when the children of Israel bondage and God sent Moses to go and take them out of bondage and Moses took them out they crossed the Red Sea and then they they was in a process now until they reach the river children now when they reach the River Jordan the dispensation changed Moses just to walk and left Joshua Joshua now Joshua make them to cross over Joshua now is the next dispensation his dispensation is was to take them out let them cross the river's children and let them drink water and move on and then when Joshua come in the ministry changed now in order that they should cross over the ministry must change will do some things that will surprise everybody like Moses he surprised everybody with the stick actually Israel Israel as the pillar of fire but Moses came with a stick how would you get that that is the ministry that he was given by God that is the dispensation of the stick all together I mean and that's you let them cross the Red Sea so now without that sick useless are we together and then when he crossed when he left them Joshua took over it was another Ministry so now what was happening remember before they could cross the River Jordan the River Jordan was in flood they took them right to the floods he did not use the sticks said no actually he made an altar right in the order and they cross over and then when he's in that side he met the first thing that he made was an angel do you know what Joshua did said who are you I'm the captain of this house Joshua understood the language he didn't say where do you come from what is your name I just understood that now this is now what I want you to say it was Joshua that was giving instructions was the one that is a a manifesting he was not seen by a naked eye there was many first things [Applause] when it changes the ministry it will surprise the whole world because that should be the minister that is the minister Ministry that must give you a rapturing faith ful are we together now while we are still on that Ministry some will be departing by the same ministers now our Lord Jesus Christ one day was with his disciples and then they they had the Lord but before they had the loads up he said to them this evening you are all going to be disappointed yeah because what happened his ministry was to show the world that he's a Son of God together now to show the world that is the Son of God as long as that Ministry was not recognized he wouldn't stop if if you read John 10. he says I and my father and then he said to them and I think in verse 35 all the things that I've done why do stone what do you Stone me for I've done a lot of things for making miracles doing good things because you are a man you make yourself if you were if you were living during that time you will see sense in what the Pharisees were saying [Music] she spoke sense we don't want science we want revelation so now but what happened is in Matthew 16. he said he asked what would you his disciples that when people see me foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign right I'll tell you but from that day he started preaching about going to Jerusalem you see he was on that way he was on rapturing but his ministry has a surprise even his own disciples get deep behind me he called him the angel of the devil because Peter was saying that the ministry is that could multiply bread who can touch that man so he repeated again this evening I wish you are going to be disappointed [Music] and then Peter said yes they are going to be disappeared but not me [Applause] now you read the Bible all the disciples turn against Jesus because of the changing of his ministry changing of his sermon you are going Peter said not me Peter remember you remember even say you open up before the conquers you know the first time you'll be you'll deny me three times now it's the change now the Bible is say the Bible says he's the same yesterday today what he did then he will do it right what what happened there was a time where he said to them okay because you said I must not go to uh Jerusalem and be crucified let's go and pray that that thing should not happen foreign God cannot change his is what you call his promise you remember he divided his disciples are going to push into two portions and the third one I was I was saying to some other children I was teaching them said now how many disciples did Jesus have um he took he took three of them you pray here and you the other age I'm going to pray now I said to these children remember what was the uh what you call the the what were they praying for because he says I am going to be persecuted now when they pray and say oh Lord save our master foreign so I said but hear him saying [Applause] because it's something that must happen so when things are going to the end there is always a pleasure the changing of the Ministries and then from now on they could not even understand they have won a Peter said thou at the Christ the son of the Living God and he was given the key of the kingdom of heaven with that Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven without the the anointing that comes from God it'll make a mess up so I'm sure you all can hear I'm not talking about a dead person I'm talking about the ministry that gave her job together I mean now look at that thing okay fine now you heard the Bible says uh let me re-read it again I read the first Corinthians chapter 15. I read only verse 22. and I don't have watching before okay for in Adam all died even saw in Christ shall all be made alive so now how are they made alive there should be a spirit that quickened them [Applause] how to get remote so now a quickening spirit must have Faith ready must have a dispensation you cannot preach the right thing with the wrong dispensation will be diverted I've given you an example about the disciples your prayers should be in line is what God is doing at that time [Applause] are we together now what was God doing during our Lord Jesus Christ remember the Bible says without controversy great is the mystery of godliness he was speaking about God In the Flesh now in our time what are we waiting we are even on Sunday pasta that's the word has been delivered the word has been revealed now what what else is the manifestation of government that word must be manifested now in order that the word must be manifested it should be child Angels so that the weight must be manifested look if you are fighting the devil and you find that that devil is so weak we won't be sure about your victory you must have a very strong devil and [Applause] [Music] [Applause] lay they choose themselves The Whole World Imagine The Old World you have only 12 people that support you together now that you show how powerful is your ministry now if okay you call God standing at the right point he's bound to hear you you know why I say he's bound to hear you because God will be seeing his son now who is the Son of God the word is the son yes he said he said let us make man in our way after our likeness in the beginning was the weight the weight was with God now when you start processing himself he became the wait yeah and then now he wants you to be the wait too then that way must manifest himself that is our Lord Jesus Christ there was a time when he was Jesus when he was Jesus I have Energies then one day Heaven opened and then when the heaven opened and then Christ the Son of God descended in Jesus now if you go to uh Acts chapter 2 verse 36 says that very same Jesus has made him Lord and Christine that man made him the Lord and Christ because the word of God descended in him now when the word of God descended in Jesus the word of God is preached in you and when you receive that word of God informed his son it becomes the word itself [Applause] you read it in uh the The Book of John chapter 10. are we together so now what we are talking about here we're talking about going home see if one goes home we become happy because we see the manifestation of the promise god promise that we will go some will go before us but where they are now maybe I will read one scripture and close because it's nine o'clock we said we'll finish at night now there's one scripture that I want us to read so I said where they are now uh they they are very happy now the thing is the supernatural it's not something that you can explain it should be revealed to an individuals if you can go to heaven now and come back and say and tell us copies [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] the scriptures repeat itself our Lord Jesus Christ they knew him they knew him as the son of Mary and Joseph now when he says he's the son of God that's why I said no to a normal person he was saying something that a far-fetched thing but it foreign [Music] somebody said to me you guys who are preaching about the underwear in which Dimensions the prophet taught us there's a fifth Dimensions now where is this underworld [Applause] the prophet the prophet and the Bible the Bible speaks about dimensions but the prophet comes in to speak about the levels of the dimensions he said In Heaven There are levels [Applause] that is why the seven steps to the king's Chambers my place will be in Hallelujah foreign [Music] the king of darkness is has a level where now the Angels not kept not their first estate there are levels when the souls that are in prison that is why the Bible speaks about which season speak about it it's in the Bible it's in a level the man you know tomorrow can be made not that the mind is Disturbed now don't ask me how um but what happened is his memories his reasoning is gone imagination is gone even if it could be your brother he wouldn't recognize you that's it and then where is the soul of that individual because in The Fifth Dimension is the souls that of the people that are dead right but this person is alive okay at times it's it's difficult to speak about these things it's closing I was surprised foreign [Music] then she went home and then I
