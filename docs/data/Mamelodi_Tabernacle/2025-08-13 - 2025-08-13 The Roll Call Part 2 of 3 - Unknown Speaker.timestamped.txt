[0:38] But finding him
[0:44] in the beginning
[0:49] in the beginning was
[1:05] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; Have you ever seen the Lord Jesus in the
[1:09] city?
[1:17] &gt;&gt; As we have even said,
[1:20] &gt;&gt; we have never seen him attending any
[1:22] funeral.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't know the brothers of
[1:55] Lazarus?
[1:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, they

[2:02] &gt;&gt; I am Amen.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; I have
[2:21] he didn't say I
[2:24] am.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. the way. He is the way.
[2:37] We must fight
[2:42] the beginning. He is the beginning.
[2:50] The Bible says all
[2:56] the
[2:58] is all.
[3:02] All in all,
[3:12] &gt;&gt; now
[3:15] I'm reading.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; Here comes
[3:20] Philip.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; The first thing after he met the
[3:23] Messiah,
[3:26] he went after his brother.
[3:30] So they used to sit around the table
[3:35] coming.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; Now reading about it,
[3:43] waiting for for it to be made
[3:47] to dwell among them.
[3:51] Hallelujah. So they they used to go to
[3:53] the synagogue
[3:55] and they would hear ministers preaching
[3:57] there.
[4:00] is coming. And there was another woman
[4:03] down there.
[4:07] She also had the same thing.
[4:24] Amen. Amen. You know, you have the
[4:25] logos. You have the logos.
[4:29] Now is the entire word of God
[4:36] only how he he brought it down into
[4:38] time.
[4:43] He brought that word
[4:46] into time.
[4:48] So your body is time.
[4:52] You are born.
[4:55] &gt;&gt; We celebrate
[4:57] &gt;&gt; and you go to school.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; We celebrate
[5:03] &gt;&gt; while doing all these things.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; There's a place down there.
[5:10] What do you call it?
[5:13] They are busy creating a coffin for you.
[5:21] Amen.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; Sometimes, you know, I'm a pastor.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We want to make one for the
[5:33] pastors and one for the kings.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; Let me not frighten you.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; No, I I mean
[5:46] &gt;&gt; while we are celebrating
[5:50] When things are in process,
[5:53] somebody there
[5:55] is also working on a coffin.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; You get what I mean?
[6:02] &gt;&gt; Because he knows that
[6:04] that body is trop
[6:16] your soul. But so we are
[6:20] &gt;&gt; amen.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; No.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; I'm keeping my eye on the
[6:28] clock.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; Let's see.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; And Nathaniel said unto him,
[6:36] &gt;&gt; now
[6:38] Philip says,
[6:39] &gt;&gt; "We have found him
[6:42] &gt;&gt; of whom
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Moses in the law and the prophets did
[6:46] write.
[6:56] Hallelujah.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; So that's why after he read about him
[7:14] after the book
[7:17] because it was no more.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. like the Holy Ghost.
[7:30] Bible says finally
[7:33] &gt;&gt; when he
[7:36] &gt;&gt; you know sometimes you have uh the
[7:40] sensation
[7:45] without him
[7:50] it's come to be him
[7:54] will guide you
[7:59] &gt;&gt; guide
[8:08] to us now.
[8:10] Amen.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; He
[8:16] move.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And are you listening?
[8:31] We have found
[8:33] him.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; This man was positive
[8:38] of whom Moses in the law
[8:41] &gt;&gt; the prophets did right.
[8:51] And Nathaniel said unto him, can any
[8:53] good thing come out of Nazareth? says
[8:56] unto him, "Come and see."
[9:03] Now, he didn't say, "Come and read, come
[9:07] and hear," but come and see.
[9:16] Amen.
[9:18] Amen. Because they have passed these
[9:21] other stages.
[9:25] Amen.
[9:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; They have passed the hearing stage.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; I have heard but now I see.
[9:38] Amen. Hallelujah.
[9:41] Amen.
[9:44] As I said
[9:47] where I was employed
[9:50] here somebody came
[9:55] to advertise
[9:57] &gt;&gt; this catalog.
[10:00] So he opened up the catalog.
[10:03] Then you are saying
[10:05] to the my employers
[10:09] this is this electrical things
[10:13] &gt;&gt; and my employer together with the
[10:16] co-workers
[10:20] catalog
[10:22] this one is nice
[10:25] this one. So after that then they said
[10:29] to him
[10:30] &gt;&gt; now let us see.
[10:34] Amen.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Let us see.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; So to advertise something,
[10:44] &gt;&gt; it's something else. It's a theory.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; You're talking about something that is
[10:49] not there.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; So after that they said, "Let us see."
[10:58] and
[11:00] he didn't have the stuff with him.
[11:05] So that old uh e man,
[11:11] he took that catalog
[11:14] your book
[11:17] &gt;&gt; since you don't have the goods.
[11:21] Amen. Amen.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; You know if you advertise something
[11:26] You must have it.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Does this uh uh I will use a word that
[11:39] will not maybe
[11:42] do any damage
[11:44] like a thick set brother.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[11:51] So,
[11:55] they came to my
[11:58] advertising.
[12:01] So, they opened their catalog
[12:05] and said,
[12:07] &gt;&gt; as I've said, I've told you before,
[12:11] you know, myself, I was heavy.
[12:15] And so, they said to me, they targeted
[12:17] me because I was
[12:22] So they came with this stuff
[12:26] to help you to stay down.
[12:32] So they were talking to us said you see
[12:36] this one in a week's time
[12:40] you feel that you have
[12:43] all this time I was looking at them
[12:56] going one
[12:59] see this Once
[13:01] &gt;&gt; once in the morning
[13:04] within 3 weeks
[13:07] you will lose so so
[13:13] yeah but I was looking at the
[13:19] preaching the gospel
[13:23] you
[13:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus said Jesus made you holy
[13:36] Amen. Amen. If
[13:38] &gt;&gt; then he is he makes people holy
[13:42] &gt;&gt; and you are advertising that
[13:45] with you.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:58] arrives here,
[14:00] &gt;&gt; come and see.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; He said to to Nathaniel,
[14:07] &gt;&gt; come and see.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; Now, there was something in Philip.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; Now, these people I'm talking about
[14:16] where that part of us,
[14:22] the ass of God.
[14:26] So as I said the other day,
[14:30] you know how Peter
[14:34] &gt;&gt; he came
[14:36] and they looked at that man who was a
[14:38] I think or something like that.
[14:43] Now we used to just sit
[14:46] by the gate there
[14:49] through some coins and so
[14:55] whatever.
[14:58] But when
[15:01] and
[15:04] they came.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Now Peter said,
[15:08] "Silver and gold have me now.
[15:15] You can
[15:20] actually
[15:34] here comes
[15:38] Peter and John
[15:43] Last year we have something in
[15:48] &gt;&gt; he said look unto us
[15:57] the same
[16:04] that position to say to the people
[16:08] &gt;&gt; we don't have any church
[16:15] knowledge
[16:16] and look unto
[16:24] let us
[16:37] Amen.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Peter,
[16:42] &gt;&gt; John,
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Johan,
[16:43] &gt;&gt; they were ask.
[17:01] So now
[17:03] &gt;&gt; here now here is part of the other
[17:06] members here
[17:10] &gt;&gt; the founders
[17:14] &gt;&gt; not just preachers
[17:18] &gt;&gt; but founders
[17:21] we have found
[17:26] we have read about
[17:29] we have how they
[17:36] &gt;&gt; right
[17:38] &gt;&gt; and Nathaniel
[17:40] &gt;&gt; Nathaniel
[17:41] &gt;&gt; and verse 41
[17:44] 41
[17:45] &gt;&gt; this is wonderful
[17:49] 41
[17:50] &gt;&gt; and
[17:51] no no verse 48
[17:54] number 48
[17:58] &gt;&gt; rather 47
[18:00] Now after that
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus saw Nathaniel coming unto him.
[18:13] &gt;&gt; Now that's more than reading.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:24] Jesus
[18:27] &gt;&gt; coming where?
[18:30] &gt;&gt; To him.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[18:37] we like to go to church but not to him.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Where we can enjoy ourselves.
[18:48] Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory.
[18:50] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[18:54] Now the Bible says
[18:56] &gt;&gt; and
[18:59] said
[19:00] and the Lord when he saw Nathaniel
[19:04] he said of him is wonderful God says
[19:08] something
[19:18] now this was a personal
[19:25] Not just somebody
[19:27] help us. But now that was a personal
[19:30] thing.
[19:36] Then the Lord said
[19:45] no.
[19:48] I think
[19:50] something
[19:57] you know the people can praise you
[20:00] and say you are this
[20:03] and tomorrow they change.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[20:07] We thought this exact
[20:16] but
[20:17] God say
[20:25] &gt;&gt; verse 41
[20:26] &gt;&gt; 41
[20:28] &gt;&gt; oh verse 40 one of the two who had who
[20:30] heard John speak and followed him was
[20:34] Peter's brother
[20:37] John
[20:41] find his own brother Simon
[20:45] said unto We have
[20:55] &gt;&gt; we have found him.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; It's a personal thing.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Which is being interpreted the Christ
[21:10] &gt;&gt; brought him to Jesus. You must bring the
[21:13] people to
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Bring them to him.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; He knows A to Z with R to Z.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; He's the alpha and omega.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Alpha and Omega. Because he said to
[21:43] &gt;&gt; before
[21:46] you
[21:52] &gt;&gt; he saw him before.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; He brought him to to church.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; I think you are not with me now.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; And he brought him to
[22:10] to Jesus.
[22:13] And when Jesus beheld him,
[22:18] &gt;&gt; he saidimon
[22:24] thou shall be called
[22:27] by interpretation stone.
[22:32] Amen.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; That's why he said,
[22:36] "Amen." Amen.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; I shall build my church
[22:41] &gt;&gt; upon the stone but was not upon
[22:46] the revelation
[22:50] of him.
[22:57] So this were the founders.
[23:03] Amen. Amen.
[23:05] Now today I'm going to be very very
[23:08] short
[23:11] in preparation for something.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; Now
[23:16] some are familiar with this
[23:19] &gt;&gt; but I'm going back to John 4.
[23:23] Amen. Amen. Now what I'm trying to talk
[23:26] about
[23:29] which maybe
[23:32] will take us hours
[23:36] uh to redeem time
[23:42] call.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; These people
[23:47] recognize
[23:49] that this man
[23:52] is the one Moses wrote about.
[24:03] Amen.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; All this time they have heard about you.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; They have read about you
[24:11] but they were subjects
[24:15] waiting
[24:17] waiting for what for that way
[24:22] flesh. Amen.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; So
[24:29] &gt;&gt; when they were put on flesh,
[24:35] &gt;&gt; those who were with him in the
[24:36] beginning.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; So here they come.
[24:45] Amen.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Because they believe that
[24:52] &gt;&gt; he is in this tabernacle.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; Peter said,
[25:17] of eternal life
[25:20] in you.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; How did Peter know that?
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Those beings,
[25:32] &gt;&gt; they were with him.
[25:35] Hallelujah.
[25:37] Did you read the scripture that says
[25:41] we were chosen in him
[25:45] for the foundation of
[25:51] amen?
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Now who came first?
[25:57] &gt;&gt; You or the world?
[26:02] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says
[26:14] you or sin.
[26:17] Amen.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:38] Hallelujah.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; There were someies.
[26:51] Amen. Amen. Hey,
[26:53] &gt;&gt; you know they used to walk like this in
[26:54] their robes.
[26:58] He found them in the synagogue.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; And they gave him the scroll.
[27:08] You know how they criticized him?
[27:11] So he opened the scroll.
[27:14] So there were someies
[27:16] this and that.
[27:18] Amen. Amen. But
[27:23] when he was on the scene.
[27:27] Amen.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; When he was on the scene,
[27:31] &gt;&gt; let me while while we are here, look at
[27:33] this.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; The one who came
[27:39] and he was in the synagogue.
[27:43] The Bible says
[27:45] &gt;&gt; now we read again
[27:49] &gt;&gt; Luke 3 verse 1-2
[27:56] Luke 31
[27:58] Hallelujah
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:03] Now in the 15th year of the reign of
[28:05] Tibarius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being
[28:09] the governor of Judea and Herod being
[28:12] the tetra the tetrarch of Galilee and
[28:15] his brother Philip tetra of it Italia
[28:19] and of the region of Traonitis and
[28:24] Lisania the tetra of Abileneas
[28:28] and Caiaphas being the high priests. The
[28:31] word of God came unto John the son of
[28:35] Zakarias in the wilderness.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; In those days
[28:44] when this one was that and that one was
[28:46] this and that
[28:50] one was the high priest.
[28:52] The word of God.
[28:57] I passed all of them.
[29:09] Amen.
[29:20] They look down to him.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; I understand
[29:32] chicken and what what else?
[29:41] fighting with a stick chasing
[29:51] sometimes with a blue eyeen.
[30:05] Hallelujah.
[30:07] with just like sheep
[30:11] skin.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Never had a suit like me
[30:22] or what else?
[30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; And he was there looking around.
[30:33] You were supposed to uh pinpoint him.
[30:40] He was a foreigner
[30:44] between the Old Testament and the New
[30:45] Testament.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; He was there like an eagle
[30:52] to recognize him
[30:55] standing there looking this way, looking
[30:58] that way.
[31:00] And the next thing he said
[31:03] he saw Jesus coming
[31:16] the
[31:22] job. Now you see
[31:25] &gt;&gt; the word of God.
[31:28] That's why in our sophisticated age,
[31:33] scientific age.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Where we have
[31:40] the cream.
[31:45] Amen.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; In our day,
[31:51] when we have philosophers and great men,
[32:00] Hallelujah.
[32:04] Hallelujah.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says
[32:22] &gt;&gt; John
[32:23] &gt;&gt; s Jesus coming.
[32:28] The word came to Jordan.
[32:32] John saw him coming
[32:35] materialized.
[32:39] Jesus coming to John
[32:44] because the word don't just come to you
[32:47] through a tree or something
[32:52] before the can reach you must
[32:53] materialize.
[32:59] Amen.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; I will take you back again.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Who came to
[33:11] know?
[33:14] You don't know who came to
[33:19] God bless you.
[33:28] Amen.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; One day he was on his way
[33:36] to
[33:38] Damascus
[33:40] to arrest
[33:46] on his way.
[33:48] God made a road block. Amen.
[33:53] Yes,
[33:54] &gt;&gt; because
[33:56] &gt;&gt; that you know that is the mystery of
[33:58] predestination
[34:05] sitination.
[34:22] M.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; So he was coming
[34:26] &gt;&gt; talking about we must get rid of this
[34:29] Christian.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Then God stopped him.
[34:36] A light strike across.
[34:41] He stopped there.
[34:44] Then from there what did God say
[34:48] to him?
[34:51] Go to
[34:55] &gt;&gt; he will tell you
[35:00] &gt;&gt; because
[35:03] out of the contract
[35:12] God has people here
[35:19] you pray to
[35:29] Amen.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; That's the economy of God.
[35:34] So
[35:37] Paul,
[35:38] &gt;&gt; he was blind.
[35:43] I've done this part.
[35:45] Another part there
[35:48] will do the rest.
[35:58] Amen. So he was going to Anas's
[36:03] then told him what to do and what
[36:09] amen.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; What did heaven do about it?
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Philip was somewhere else.
[36:29] away.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; It's emergency
[36:40] go down.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody
[36:45] on a chariot.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; So, Philip just appeared there.
[36:55] Hello sir.
[36:58] Yes sir.
[37:00] I'm struggling here.
[37:03] I'm reading about somebody here.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Who is this man?
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; You know these people they never just
[37:15] read the Bible.
[37:18] While reading there was something in
[37:20] them.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Who is this man?
[37:24] Hallelujah.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Then Philip
[37:36] &gt;&gt; interpreted to him
[37:40] that this word
[37:42] was made flesh. He dwelt among us.
[37:47] And the man was baptized right away.
[37:51] He had just vanished. The answer to that
[37:54] man was
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Now in closing,
[38:01] &gt;&gt; let's
[38:03] we won't finish but we'll close.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[38:10] Now we are still there. In the beginning
[38:12] was the word
[38:16] and we see now the attributes
[38:19] became words
[38:21] &gt;&gt; and they became persons.
[38:26] And this people when that word is made
[38:29] flesh
[38:34] and they
[38:38] was a man.
[38:44] Amen.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; That's why recognize him.
[38:56] Amen. Amen.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Because you can't see him from your
[38:59] mind.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; There was now a correspondence between
[39:08] him and Peter.
[39:13] They look beyond the human flesh
[39:17] see that this is him.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Now I read maybe you say
[39:28] you read this even before
[39:32] hold your peace and listen to the word
[39:33] of God. Even if you are sick
[39:37] you know divine healing.
[39:41] If you come in here and you are sick,
[39:44] just accept the will of God.
[40:06] by Jesus Christ.
[40:11] Amen. Amen.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; So you take the word of God
[40:16] and all other things
[40:21] will will take their places.
