[19:13] report

[19:29] to talk about the person that took care
[19:32] of
[19:33] me and everyone she
[19:36] loved she loved
[19:39] everyone she was a
[19:42] light she lived life to the
[19:46] fullest so on her final
[19:50] day as her
[19:55] sister I like not to talk about how she
[19:58] lived
[20:00] I would like us to remember more how she
[20:03] lived she brought light to everyone's
[20:12] life
[20:15] so on this day I
[20:19] ask let us not focus on how she left
[20:24] us let's focus on how she affected all
[20:28] of us
[20:29] how she touched Our
[20:31] Lives how she made us love how she
[20:34] inspired
[20:38] us let that be how we
[20:41] speak of her and
[20:46] not and not how she
[20:49] lived that is nothing compared to the
[20:52] type of life she lived she lived a full
[20:55] life
[21:02] and she cared and she
[21:10] loved to a lot of
[21:13] people
[21:16] so instead of a death
[21:19] report I'd like you all to take a
[21:23] moment right now and for the
[21:27] rest of your life
[21:29] whenever you remember her remember how
[21:31] she
[21:36] lived remember how she lived

[33:14] item uh that is number
[33:17] eight message from
[33:19] Sister Sister Sarah
[33:23] Sani she's she's here she will just come
[33:26] to the for
[33:33] I'm just going to speak from my heart I
[33:36] didn't write anything I'm going to speak
[33:39] from my heart
[33:40] because I happen to
[33:45] be the person that found my
[33:50] sister I don't know how I got there but
[33:53] I did
[33:58] I don't know how I got there but I
[34:02] did and I
[34:04] saw I saw my sister L
[34:08] there
[34:14] ripped the condition she was in nobody
[34:18] deserves to see their own
[34:20] sister like
[34:25] that my sister was killed like an animal
[34:28] even an animal does not deserve to be
[34:31] killed like
[34:33] that so I have a message for szel Gan
[34:38] you killed my sister I had a
[34:41] conversation with you
[34:43] szel I didn't take
[34:46] it I I didn't know what you meant that
[34:50] day but I
[34:56] thought you talked about river
[35:01] Euphrates szel talked to me about D
[35:13] Euphrates he talked to me about Riv
[35:18] Euphrates
[35:20] and somehow I thought him and I were
[35:23] sort of like in the same page
[35:30] message wise because my pastor preaches
[35:33] about
[35:37] r that day he
[35:41] said the last Angel of
[35:45] Death has left river
[35:49] Euphrates and that is why it's drying up
[35:52] because it's out here in the world and
[35:56] it's mission is to
[36:07] kill and
[36:09] destroy I didn't know that you were that
[36:12] angel of
[36:16] death only if I knew that you were
[36:19] talking about
[36:22] yourself the way you said
[36:25] it now I'm adding one W adding one plus
[36:30] one and I'm like he said
[36:33] it he said the angel of death is out the
[36:37] last angel of death is
[36:40] out and he's going to kill and
[36:44] D I didn't know it was you I had no idea
[36:49] you were talking about
[36:51] yourself I didn't know that you were the
[36:53] one that was going to take my sister's
[36:55] life
[36:59] especially this
[37:01] way why did you do
[37:07] this I'm sorry but I'm going to say it
[37:09] out
[37:12] loud I'm just going to say my heart
[37:15] out it's either you tried to take my
[37:18] sister's heart out or you took
[37:23] it the condition that she's
[37:26] in the way you ripped her
[37:29] apart where are you taking my sister's
[37:36] heart you
[37:37] meant to do this you were willing to do
[37:40] this you you you knew you were going to
[37:42] do this because you knew about the angel
[37:45] of
[37:48] death but
[37:50] anyway my main
[37:55] message is
[37:57] I'm not angry with
[38:00] anyone I've learned from my
[38:04] pastor that forgiveness is the
[38:09] key you
[38:11] forgive and move on and move forward and
[38:15] keep
[38:16] working the message that I have
[38:20] for you and everybody else that is
[38:23] involved in this mission
[38:30] you killed her
[38:32] body but you can never have her
[38:36] soul that is one thing for sure I assure
[38:39] you with all my heart my soul and
[38:40] everything in me every inch in me from
[38:43] the crown of my head to the soul of my
[38:44] feet you don't and you will never access
[38:50] my sister's
[38:54] soul my sister's soul is in Christ
[39:00] so all the work that you've
[39:03] done is all in
[39:05] vain it's all in vain and that is what
[39:09] it
[39:09] is and I stand by that because I believe
[39:14] that if God is for me nobody and
[39:17] anything can ever be against
[39:19] me and I always prayed for my sister and
[39:23] that is the word that I used every time
[39:25] when I mentioned her names
[39:28] God if you are for us nobody and
[39:31] anything can never be against us and I
[39:34] stand on that I still believe in that
[39:37] and I still trust in that and I never
[39:39] move from that position that position of
[39:42] God's word I'm standing on that until
[39:47] eternity I know who I am in Christ that
[39:51] is why I'm standing here I'm not trying
[39:53] to make myself look like I'm
[39:56] strengthened or strong
[39:58] it is the god in
[40:00] me it is the god in me that is why I'm
[40:03] facing this situation the way I'm facing
[40:06] it and that is why I am
[40:09] saying all your
[40:12] work is in vain you do not have my
[40:16] sister soul my sister is resting
[40:19] peacefully even in this coffin if you
[40:21] look at her it's like she's sleeping
[40:25] that is how peaceful she is
[40:28] the god in her the God that I
[40:31] serve has entered in her and the God
[40:33] that I serve was protecting her the I
[40:37] said purified her and bled her
[40:41] physically
[40:43] spiritually
[40:45] supernaturally and because of those
[40:47] prayers she remains cleansed and
[40:51] purifies Sanctified by my prayers I
[40:55] believe so much in the word of God
[40:58] the ministry that I
[41:00] Ser that God answers prayers he listens
[41:04] and he
[41:05] answers he allowed this to happen for a
[41:09] reason but the main thing is my sister
[41:14] soul is in Christ no devil in
[41:17] hell no devil in
[41:20] hell has my sister my sister is in
[41:24] Christ my sister's soul is in heaven
[41:27] that peace that I have in
[41:30] me there's no doubt at all in my
[41:33] heart that there's might be
[41:37] otherwise whether you have the heart or
[41:39] you
[41:41] don't it doesn't matter what matters
[41:45] is what matters
[41:47] is my sister soul

[1:38:21] instruction
[1:38:24] you need to ask

[1:38:41] purpose little did we know on such a day
[1:38:46] we'll be here in the Lani
[1:38:49] family to pay our last respect to our
[1:38:53] beloved
[1:38:57] daughter I know I knew her
[1:39:01] as because my first I gave birth to my
[1:39:05] first born in
[1:39:06] 1990 her name is
[1:39:09] mash and then two years later she gave
[1:39:12] birth she named her mashudu I was very

[1:39:23] you stole my name I want my name
[1:39:26] back so that was on a very light
[1:39:31] note little did I

[1:39:42] today it's very
[1:39:45] pathetic very
[1:39:47] pathetic and it will be a Miss of us not
[1:39:52] to talk about G based violence and
[1:39:55] femicide will be failing
[1:39:59] Mash if you don't talk about
[1:40:02] that those hands which I
[1:40:08] said I'm meant to
[1:40:12] nurture I'm meant to provide for your
[1:40:17] families not to kill
[1:40:20] us not to hit us
[1:40:24] not to
[1:40:25] abusers that's why I say it will be a
[1:40:28] Miss of me if I don't denounce gender
[1:40:31] based violence and
[1:40:36] femicide I don't know what's wrong with
[1:40:39] certain
[1:40:42] individuals I don't know what's wrong
[1:40:45] with certain men what's going on not all
[1:40:49] men that's why I say
[1:40:52] certain they are very good
[1:40:55] men very good very
[1:40:58] caring who know that those hands are
[1:41:02] meant for nurturing those hands are
[1:41:04] meant for providing for one's family
[1:41:07] those hands are meant for caressing a
[1:41:10] woman not hitting a woman or raising a
[1:41:14] hand against a
[1:41:16] woman it might be sensitive but we must
[1:41:19] say
[1:41:20] it if we don't say it now when and how
[1:41:24] are we going to say
[1:41:26] it I'm an officer of the
[1:41:28] Court by
[1:41:30] profession I won't dwell into the merits
[1:41:33] of the
[1:41:34] case s know very
[1:41:41] well which I won't get
[1:41:43] into but head's going to roll I'm
[1:41:46] telling you
[1:41:51] [Applause]
[1:41:56] L he going to
[1:42:01] roll you
[1:42:14] know uh
[1:42:18] sometimes when when when
[1:42:38] as
[1:42:49] parents a very
[1:42:51] very promising
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:43:05] not getting into the merits of the
[1:43:08] case and we are aware that some
[1:43:11] individuals are
[1:43:13] suspects so says our constitution
[1:43:16] section
[1:43:19] 35 little do we know
[1:43:28] we need to say these
[1:43:34] things we need to say such
[1:43:40] things I was very angry on Thursday when
[1:43:43] I came here I asked
[1:43:47] Sarah mashu opened a case of
[1:43:51] assault who who pressurized mashu mashu
[1:43:56] to drop that case I asked them as an
[1:43:59] officer of the
[1:44:01] Court who prized Mas to drop that case
[1:44:05] because my take and my instinct tells
[1:44:10] me if that case was not dropped was not
[1:44:16] cancelled maybe she would be
[1:44:21] alive then she answered I said I thought
[1:44:26] it was mashu's mom because the media was
[1:44:30] it was just saying
[1:44:33] family B women you must
[1:44:47] never has to sometimes has to come to an
[1:44:51] end because
[1:44:57] it might sound sensitive but we need to
[1:45:16] tell I'll respect a
[1:45:20] man I'll respect a person a
[1:45:28] woman and we must stop as a community we
[1:45:32] must stop as a
[1:45:36] nation what is
[1:45:38] that we must stop that
[1:45:43] stigmatization we must stop
[1:45:45] it
[1:45:47] because the heat that particular person
[1:45:50] is feeling you are not feeling it
[1:45:53] so let's stop
[1:45:58] it it's as
[1:46:01] women it's as women who are saying such
[1:46:04] things we must stop that we must stop
[1:46:07] such
[1:46:12] things and we must support each
[1:46:18] other this thing
[1:46:20] of PhD what you are saying
[1:46:25] what what bring her down syndrome and
[1:46:27] what what must come to an
[1:46:30] end otherwise we
[1:46:34] lose stars like this
[1:46:39] one now we have given her a title we are
[1:46:42] now saying diseased
[1:46:46] M it can't be
[1:46:49] right we can't lose such
[1:46:56] brilliant people and keep
[1:46:59] quiet as
[1:47:11] if
[1:47:14] yes we need to talk and the family must
[1:47:19] heal and I'm really disappointed if the
[1:47:22] gas you are here you disappointed
[1:47:25] me because traditionally and culturally
[1:47:28] you are from Royal Family you were
[1:47:31] supposed to have come
[1:47:42] here that's
[1:47:45] how supposed to be in terms of our
[1:47:48] culture and
[1:47:51] tradition it's
[1:47:59] what because you are supposed to send a
[1:48:02] person to come and apologize for what
[1:48:06] has happened without getting to the
[1:48:08] merage of the
[1:48:11] case I'm really
[1:48:16] disappointed more especially that on the
[1:48:19] other hand I told you
[1:48:23] who those are my relatives the royal
[1:48:26] family not not the royal family where
[1:48:29] the gas come from my aunt got married
[1:48:33] into that royal
[1:48:35] family that's why I called
[1:48:43] them
[1:48:46] questions because some of the things we
[1:48:50] need to work them traditionally and
[1:48:52] culturally
[1:48:54] he for the sake of that
[1:48:58] little
[1:49:01] child because somewh
[1:49:05] somehow as two
[1:49:08] families it's so
[1:49:11] disappointing it's so
[1:49:14] disappointing you
[1:49:16] know there are a lot of people whom
[1:49:20] I called communicated with on on
[1:49:24] Thursday very very senior people to
[1:49:28] ensure this case like any other case

[1:49:35] drain especially
[1:49:38] in where you buy everything even a
[1:49:40] person's life is I'm
[1:50:04] because
[1:50:05] in a person's life is worth nothing
[1:50:09] there are many unresolved cases of
[1:50:13] murder a
[1:50:15] lot so this one fortunately even the
[1:50:19] case number I know by heart
[1:50:23] I called very senior people about three
[1:50:27] and at the same time they responded very
[1:50:31] positively so so M wherever you are

[1:56:00] button and he going to
[1:56:03] roll because you you you you you you
[1:56:06] undermined her so much during her
[1:56:11] existence in La we we we we we say while
[1:56:14] in essay while she was still alive and
[1:56:17] even you disrespected her even in death
[1:56:22] uh
[1:56:25] that will never happen
[1:56:54] I was just I'm very much disappointed
[1:56:57] got some media houses especially
[1:57:00] local because we want that we wanted
[1:57:04] them to be
[1:57:05] here even during the week so that we
[1:57:09] denounce this monster gender based
[1:57:12] violence they were just ding why
[1:57:16] because the media houses mostly are run
[1:57:20] by certain men who don't understand this
[1:57:28] monster please grow
[1:57:34] up we cannot afford even if it was just
[1:57:39] an ordinary rural
[1:57:42] woman that was going to be too much for
[1:57:45] us what more an asset like m
[1:57:52] asset like and and the
[1:57:55] field involved very rare for young woman
[1:58:01] of her caliber you know nowadays
[1:58:04] everybody want to do something very
[1:58:06] complicated yeah not very much
[1:58:08] interested M inspired by her grandma who
[1:58:12] was
[1:58:15] a I get so she specialized in the
[1:58:19] traditional
[1:58:20] medicine so
[1:58:22] so you know that's why a very unique and
[1:58:27] rare
[1:58:29] qualification so you then you want us
[1:58:33] just to keep quiet having lost such a
[1:58:36] rare
[1:58:38] spaces it's just unfortunate most of us
[1:58:42] here we are based here in
[1:58:45] liopo if I was in on the 22nd 23rd
[1:58:52] Tuesday next week Tuesday
[1:58:55] when the so-call suspects will
[1:58:58] be we are respecting the Constitution

[1:59:05] bail we're going to pick it very
[1:59:09] heavily please do
[1:59:12] that yes you have to go and say no

[1:59:21] message
[1:59:22] to the magistrate the presiding officer
[1:59:25] as women of this world we are saying no
[1:59:29] bail should be granted to the so-called
[1:59:33] suspect because you'll never know if
[1:59:36] that so-called suspect is granted ba
[1:59:40] what's going to
[1:59:41] happen
[1:59:45] oh and another thing which is boggling
[1:59:47] my
[1:59:49] mind those people who were in the house
[1:59:54] let me not get into the Merit of the
[2:00:07] case

[2:00:14] telling me the suspect was not alone
[2:00:22] the suspect was not alone exposed
[2:00:26] everyone expose everyone and we
[2:00:30] pray if my memory St serves me
[2:00:36] well which is a premeditated

[2:12:41] stranger in the
[2:12:44] house know the late father of the house
[2:12:46] as
[2:12:48] well here to bury the daughter again
[2:12:53] the remaining sister and you know the
[2:12:57] grandchildren and all of
[2:13:00] them we Fellowship together and our
[2:13:04] pastor
[2:13:06] Israel supposed to be here this morning
[2:13:09] but he had a trust in
[2:13:11] us so we may come and comfort the family
[2:13:14] with the word of
[2:13:17] God listening to all the speeches
[2:13:21] all spot
[2:13:23] on really appreciate
[2:13:26] that what I've seen and what I've
[2:13:30] realized they knew our daughter very
[2:13:34] well you know from you know this level
[2:13:37] called a
[2:13:40] canel what she achieved in
[2:13:43] life I know them as well because I'm
[2:13:45] part of this
[2:13:47] family but my being this morning is
[2:13:50] different
[2:13:51] my being here this morning is
[2:13:54] different because I'm not going to dwell
[2:13:58] much of what you have said
[2:14:00] already everybody has heard but I'm here
[2:14:05] this morning to represent heaven to talk
[2:14:09] about something that is beyond our
[2:14:14] excellent as a human being we run a
[2:14:18] raise to a certain level and we stop
[2:14:22] there but we need the one that will take
[2:14:26] us where we
[2:14:27] stopped and go further so that's why I'm
[2:14:31] here this morning not talk
[2:14:34] about the flesh when I talk about her
[2:14:38] flesh it really cut deeper in my
[2:14:42] heart because I I know
[2:14:46] here so now the best thing we can do
[2:14:50] this morning
[2:14:51] is to talk about something beyond the
[2:14:57] flesh amen amen so the previous night I
[2:15:02] read few scriptures from the New
[2:15:04] Testament talking about the life beyond
[2:15:10] death because we are all passing but
[2:15:14] this morning I want to talk about the
[2:15:17] traveling of a soul
[2:15:21] in different
[2:15:23] dimension not just Mo because MOA is a
[2:15:28] spirit a human being is a triun
[2:15:33] being you have a flesh you have a spirit
[2:15:37] you have a soul today I'll talk about
[2:15:40] the soul not the spirit are we together
[2:15:45] because a soul the real
[2:15:49] you the real head
[2:15:52] the soul the real hair smiling
[2:15:56] somewhere the flesh that we see today we
[2:16:00] call it the
[2:16:02] remaining of who she
[2:16:05] was to bury it but I will focus on her
[2:16:11] soul that's who she
[2:16:14] was amen amen so we we read the
[2:16:17] scripture here deliberately I want to
[2:16:20] show you
[2:16:21] something in the Old
[2:16:23] Testament this scripture it speaks about
[2:16:28] a woman of
[2:16:30] endo who had the familiar
[2:16:34] Spirit who raised had the power to raise
[2:16:37] the
[2:16:38] dead when such happen in our
[2:16:43] tradition we will go maybe somewhere
[2:16:47] there in the
[2:16:48] village inquire what happened to our
[2:16:53] doctor what what motivate
[2:16:56] this that's how we do things in our pett
[2:17:02] culture it has never started with us we
[2:17:06] just read it from the Bible and it tells
[2:17:08] us that it has happened long time ago
[2:17:12] and right in Israel right with
[2:17:16] soul amen amen you know if he doesn't
[2:17:19] see well he went to
[2:17:22] inquire want to know what will happen
[2:17:26] about his
[2:17:28] future everybody want to know what will
[2:17:32] happen about him or her
[2:17:36] tomorrow and going forward everyone of
[2:17:39] us here you want to know that's why you
[2:17:43] have the people you consult
[2:17:47] with amen amen it's for only that reason
[2:17:51] you want to know what is
[2:17:52] happening in your life what is what will
[2:17:56] happen in our future or has happened
[2:18:00] previously it so
[2:18:03] natural we see Saul doing
[2:18:07] it and then went to this woman and he
[2:18:11] was
[2:18:12] disguising because he knew that in
[2:18:16] Israel there is God and according to the
[2:18:19] law of God
[2:18:21] you are not supposed to do that and
[2:18:23] that's why he
[2:18:25] disguised because he know I will get the
[2:18:28] answer from there and he got the
[2:18:32] answer amen amen and then this woman
[2:18:36] brought him
[2:18:38] Samuel and this woman had a familiar
[2:18:41] Spirit but he had the power to raise the
[2:18:44] prophet of
[2:18:46] God and here comes samel as he was and
[2:18:51] Saul saw him and they
[2:18:53] communicated and Saul tell told him
[2:18:57] there I mean Samuel told Saul your days
[2:19:01] are
[2:19:02] numbered your kingdom is gone it has
[2:19:05] been given to David you fast you pray
[2:19:09] harder You Raise Me from the death you
[2:19:12] pray God is not going to change that
[2:19:15] thing it will stay on like that because
[2:19:19] God has done it already is a complete
[2:19:22] job the complete job job of
[2:19:26] God can never be Ted at any
[2:19:29] time it stays like that and forever like
[2:19:34] that can you see that so we see it
[2:19:38] happening
[2:19:40] communication between Saul Samuel and
[2:19:43] the woman of Endor and Saul get what he
[2:19:48] wanted and it was the end of the story
[2:19:52] can you see that so he has the power to
[2:19:56] raise the dead it was the time God
[2:20:00] allowed those
[2:20:02] things so let's go to another
[2:20:05] scripture we will get there amen amen
[2:20:09] First
[2:20:10] Kings chapter 22 we'll read verse
[2:20:15] 19
[2:20:19] 23
[2:20:49] for for
[2:21:35] amen
[2:21:37] amen if you will understand
[2:21:40] me give me an undivided
[2:21:44] attention I want to show you something
[2:21:47] and the last script I'm going to read
[2:21:50] you will have the answer for
[2:21:52] everything and what is happening
[2:21:55] today amen amen if you can read this
[2:21:59] scripture and understand it it's in
[2:22:02] heaven
[2:22:04] here amen amen in the Throne of God
[2:22:08] there was a
[2:22:09] communication because the communication
[2:22:12] up there end up here
[2:22:16] on amen amen now God was
[2:22:21] asking you know the children of God the
[2:22:25] angel while he was sitting on his
[2:22:28] throne that hey
[2:22:32] manab is making trouble down
[2:22:35] there on Earth I need to deal with him
[2:22:40] but how can I deal with
[2:22:42] him let's discuss this thing and they
[2:22:46] discussed and one was saying that one
[2:22:49] was saying this and so forth and so
[2:22:51] forth but the other one said I will put
[2:22:56] the lying
[2:22:58] spirit in the mouth of the prophets of
[2:23:02] Ahab you know we trust the prophet so
[2:23:05] much until we cannot see when they lie
[2:23:07] to
[2:23:09] us and
[2:23:11] then the lying Spirit condescended upon
[2:23:16] them when he in them they said to
[2:23:19] prophesy and when they prophesied they
[2:23:22] were prophesying
[2:23:24] lies but they were Prophet we need to
[2:23:27] know the true and the false
[2:23:31] prophet and they they they they put
[2:23:34] their
[2:23:35] ly in their mouth and they prophesy
[2:23:40] against Ahab they say to Ahab you are
[2:23:44] going to win the battle but one Prophet
[2:23:48] by the name of Mah said you going to to
[2:23:50] th
[2:23:51] day this one was
[2:23:56] unfamiliar to Israel this one were
[2:24:00] famous to Israel but that day Heaven Is
[2:24:06] Spoken the lying
[2:24:09] Spirit Came Upon them and the prophesy
[2:24:14] lie and one will will ask a question why
[2:24:18] the lying
[2:24:19] spirit from Heaven because we regard
[2:24:23] Heaven as the most harmonious place
[2:24:27] ever but there comes life from
[2:24:31] Heaven upon the prophet you must know
[2:24:35] that there is a permissive will of
[2:24:38] God perfect will of
[2:24:41] God amen amen then the life Spirit get
[2:24:44] to
[2:24:45] them and they prophesied lies and Ahab
[2:24:49] went to war
[2:24:51] and he was killed they prophesied Li
[2:24:55] amen that's why the man of God requested
[2:24:58] all of
[2:24:59] them killed because the prophesy lie I'm
[2:25:03] trying to show you go with God in
[2:25:08] dispensation know what God is doing at
[2:25:12] what time you will find comfort in your
[2:25:15] life there are situations in life we
[2:25:19] cannot change
[2:25:21] we may try this and try that but that
[2:25:24] situation will never change if God
[2:25:27] allowed it to be like
[2:25:30] this amen amen my
[2:25:34] father di of
[2:25:42] accident
[2:25:44] [Music]
[2:25:45] says when okay my father was going to to
[2:25:50] Amen
[2:25:51] in amen amen so there was the
[2:25:56] K that's when I've learned something
[2:26:00] that time I was still at school and my
[2:26:03] father had two
[2:26:05] cars van and a normal private car but
[2:26:09] that weekend he decided to leave those
[2:26:12] car
[2:26:13] in come home with a TXI and go back with
[2:26:16] a TXI he was killed on the way then we
[2:26:20] were
[2:26:24] like what was the reason for him to
[2:26:26] leave take
[2:26:28] a now he's dead amen
[2:26:34] amen often say death is calling amen
[2:26:38] death calls yes calls you yes death
[2:26:40] calls you when you are not thinking
[2:26:42] about anything something happened that
[2:26:46] could
[2:26:47] lead to your departure
[2:26:50] as as human beings with our intelligence
[2:26:54] we thought you could have taken this
[2:26:57] way amen amen but God allowed them for
[2:27:02] what reason God knows amen I'm the first
[2:27:07] born in the house people came to the
[2:27:09] house to comfort us my mom and my
[2:27:14] sibling and the others came there is
[2:27:18] somebody who perform
[2:27:21] will assist you so that you can know who
[2:27:25] killed your dead what you need to do

[2:27:35] tell me about something whom I must
[2:27:38] consult you are just bringing hatred in
[2:27:41] the house because if I can know that
[2:27:43] person I'm going to pay Revenge I'm
[2:27:46] going to hate him so I better not know
[2:27:51] because God knows why he took my
[2:27:56] away the other
[2:27:59] fights

[2:29:47] sister to survive but knew why he needed
[2:29:51] to depart we shall know the purpose

[2:30:03] scripture in

[2:30:41] again in heaven the place for the Angels
[2:30:44] but listen
[2:30:56] amen
[2:30:59] amen you know when you read the Bible in
[2:31:02] the Book of
[2:31:03] Genesis the Bible says sometimes during
[2:31:07] the evening hours God will condescend it
[2:31:11] in the Garden of Eden and speak to aam
[2:31:16] aam are you still okay are the Lions
[2:31:19] okay
[2:31:20] are the bed okay are the mountain good
[2:31:23] are the river still flowing how is
[2:31:26] things here because I made you God to
[2:31:30] control over everything then Adam said
[2:31:33] all is
[2:31:35] fine amen it was God
[2:31:39] communicating with his people and there
[2:31:42] were moment where his people communicate
[2:31:46] to him and give him some presentation
[2:31:51] amen when they were busy
[2:31:54] presenting devil come as
[2:31:58] [Music]
[2:32:02] well said
[2:32:04] people are well not well
[2:32:08] because you have protected them then God
[2:32:11] allowed the
[2:32:13] devil Satan himself to test them then he
[2:32:17] said job my servant
[2:32:20] there he's a good man you
[2:32:24] see I want to tell you this you see we
[2:32:28] are living in this world but there's
[2:32:31] always there's a
[2:32:33] meeting about us in heaven and can I
[2:32:37] take it further is the heaven that
[2:32:40] decide for us let me repeat it it's
[2:32:44] Heaven that decide for us we can't
[2:32:48] deceive
[2:32:50] we are in a nor man's land when you are
[2:32:53] in this world you are getting influence
[2:32:57] either from God or from the devil you
[2:33:00] are just nobody you are just a mechanic
[2:33:04] you need the
[2:33:08] dynamic are we
[2:33:10] together you are just a living
[2:33:12] cop you need something that will
[2:33:16] incarnate you for you to walk you to
[2:33:20] speak for you to read for you to eat you
[2:33:24] need something that will come to
[2:33:27] you amen
[2:33:30] hallelujah that is the world we are
[2:33:31] living in don't think you know better
[2:33:35] you don't know Heaven has decided about
[2:33:38] you we don't know maybe next week
[2:33:42] There's a funeral for one of us here do
[2:33:46] you know that you don't know that secret
[2:33:49] with God our sister here God knew that
[2:33:54] she will depart God knew will be there
[2:33:57] today but there's a reason behind it we
[2:34:00] might not see it because always our
[2:34:04] naked
[2:34:05] eye deceive us let's go
[2:34:09] beyond the flesh a little bit you will
[2:34:12] realize something so the devil was
[2:34:15] giving report and when the devil bring
[2:34:18] report he was bringing in the negative
[2:34:20] report before God and God knew about it
[2:34:25] that this man is always bringing a bad
[2:34:29] report to me but God was looking at him
[2:34:33] he was listening at him he was giving
[2:34:35] him an opportunity he knows there will
[2:34:39] be a time whereby he will never have
[2:34:43] access that's where I want to take you
[2:34:46] to now what I'm teaching you here is
[2:34:49] when the devil have access to you to
[2:34:54] your everything and God knows about
[2:34:59] them amen amen and then the sons of God
[2:35:05] present to God we see the devil
[2:35:08] presenting to God and the presentation
[2:35:10] of the devil is
[2:35:12] like this people in fact they are not
[2:35:16] good and he was right they were not good
[2:35:20] they need the protection of God for you
[2:35:22] to beat the
[2:35:24] devil you must have God in you if you do
[2:35:27] not have a God in you you will never
[2:35:30] deceive that
[2:35:31] angel the angel called
[2:35:34] Lucifer he so
[2:35:37] cunning he fought many battles he won
[2:35:41] many battles but when mik come he gave
[2:35:45] way because Mel was the ACT angel of God
[2:35:51] Michael was the only angel that can
[2:35:55] defeat the Devil and Michael was God in
[2:36:00] a form of an
[2:36:01] Angel when God descended in us we become
[2:36:06] God in the form of a man for you to
[2:36:10] defeat the Devil God must be in you you
[2:36:15] must be a God incarnate
[2:36:19] apart from that you will just become
[2:36:22] somebody who's living in this
[2:36:25] world without the mission and the vision
[2:36:28] and the objective of
[2:36:31] life amen amen so we
[2:36:36] see the
[2:36:38] souls
[2:36:39] traveling in different
[2:36:43] dimensions and that soul is the real
[2:36:47] person the life
[2:36:50] Beyond this
[2:36:53] canel is the real life is the genuine
[2:36:56] life is the life eternal because the
[2:37:00] soul is the real you and the soul is the
[2:37:04] one that was
[2:37:09] processed you know
[2:37:11] processing you were part of the
[2:37:15] Soul was part of God processed
[2:37:20] to our flesh so in our inner
[2:37:24] most is the part of God that part of God
[2:37:29] will respond to
[2:37:32] God amen amen Jesus
[2:37:35] Christ lived here on this
[2:37:38] world for 33 years he was in a youthful
[2:37:43] age when he was living there for 33
[2:37:48] years came a
[2:37:50] moment where he should die for us at the
[2:37:54] cross he was crucified on the cross when
[2:37:57] he was crucified on the cross that's
[2:38:00] when we realize in fact the real life is
[2:38:05] the life beyond the
[2:38:08] grave amen amen other people they want
[2:38:12] to drink beer with a
[2:38:16] coat he turned water into wine
[2:38:22] and they stuck
[2:38:24] there amen amen other people they rely
[2:38:28] on
[2:38:30] healing they stuck
[2:38:32] there amen amen so with those kind of
[2:38:36] things he performed here on Earth they
[2:38:40] stuck there I'm here this morning to
[2:38:44] tell you
[2:38:46] all don't Stu there go
[2:38:50] beyond the canel when you go beyond the
[2:38:53] canel you start to see the real you when
[2:38:57] you start to real you even in thisal
[2:39:04] body control all the of the world you
[2:39:08] look up
[2:39:09] there if one
[2:39:11] day you go here in the street of
[2:39:17] M you see a person like you
[2:39:21] not your brother your
[2:39:26] sister the twins will now in somewhere
[2:39:29] they will
[2:39:32] differ they would even say you look
[2:39:34] alike but this one's is that means it's
[2:39:37] a
[2:39:38] difference I'm I'm I'm I'm saying the
[2:39:42] person who's really like
[2:39:45] you you as you
[2:39:47] are what are you going to

[2:39:59] and you realize it's you you will leave
[2:40:03] all and follow that person because it's
[2:40:07] you amen amen so we started to realize
[2:40:11] the real life is their life beyond
[2:40:16] death because when Jesus died
[2:40:20] a lot has
[2:40:22] happened if you think Jesus has done
[2:40:26] Miracle when he was on
[2:40:29] Earth go and read the Bible again he has
[2:40:32] done
[2:40:33] many beyond the grave the Bible says I
[2:40:38] read this scripture previous night I'm
[2:40:40] not going to read it
[2:40:41] today when he was going to the
[2:40:45] Cross when they crucify him they look at
[2:40:49] body in the grave now that
[2:40:55] being
[2:40:57] ISR amen amen when he was in the grave
[2:41:02] because us as people in the
[2:41:05] flesh we can see only with the naked eye
[2:41:10] then we see his flesh there but beyond
[2:41:13] the flesh day there was a spirit there
[2:41:17] was a soul and the Bible says his Spirit
[2:41:21] went back to God his soul is the one
[2:41:25] that changed
[2:41:27] Dimensions going there and going there
[2:41:30] and the Bible says his soul went
[2:41:34] [Music]
[2:41:35] beneath amen amen why his soul went
[2:41:39] beneath to tell the people that you
[2:41:42] dispel the gospel during the time of
[2:41:46] Noah during the time of Lord
[2:41:49] you were rejecting me and let me tell
[2:41:53] you a
[2:41:55] soul
[2:42:00] being his
[2:42:02] flesh is in the grave his soul is
[2:42:06] preaching down there and the devil and
[2:42:10] the demon recognize him that here is
[2:42:15] Jesus in a spiritual body have you ever
[2:42:19] fight
[2:42:21] someone in the street
[2:42:24] there beat you to
[2:42:26] BP amen
[2:42:32] amen when you get
[2:42:35] home you try to open the
[2:42:37] door block the door with his
[2:42:40] food said here I
[2:42:47] am amen amen that's what happens to the
[2:42:50] Devil Revelation 12 says there was a war
[2:42:54] in heaven war in heaven Lucifer and his
[2:42:58] Angel M and his Angel F and the people
[2:43:03] there took their
[2:43:05] stand on the side of Lucifer or on the
[2:43:09] side
[2:43:11] of they took the stand there and at the
[2:43:15] stand you
[2:43:16] took is the stand that is sustaining you
[2:43:21] today so God Jesus Michael fought and
[2:43:27] defeated
[2:43:28] him and he fell down here when Jesus
[2:43:33] come here he went to the below then
[2:43:36] Jesus after his death he followed him
[2:43:40] below and the devil started to
[2:43:47] complain now time for
[2:43:51] Jesus said no it's not a time I still
[2:43:54] have to put you here in prison what I
[2:43:57] need here is the key of hell and
[2:44:03] haters I want to take them when he took
[2:44:07] them I go up when he get here he take
[2:44:12] the
[2:44:13] saints that believed the word of God and
[2:44:16] he went up with them
[2:44:19] amen amen that's where I wanted to show
[2:44:22] you in the Old
[2:44:24] Testament the devil had access even to
[2:44:29] the prophet even to the prophet the
[2:44:32] demons had access to communicate with
[2:44:36] God even in heaven and put the lying
[2:44:39] spirit in the prophets but when Jesus
[2:44:44] came he came between two
[2:44:47] books between two books
[2:44:50] between the Old Testament and the New
[2:44:52] Testament now the
[2:44:55] dispensation
[2:44:57] changed if your father is it's your
[2:45:00] father you will know him even if he can
[2:45:05] disguise now the people started holding
[2:45:10] on the Old Testament L they know God has
[2:45:14] moved in the New
[2:45:17] Testament Jesus to change the whole
[2:45:20] dispensation when Jesus come change the
[2:45:25] dimension he take those one of the devil
[2:45:28] leave them in the Fifth
[2:45:31] Dimension and the children of God in the
[2:45:34] sixth
[2:45:35] Dimension above now two World
[2:45:40] apart amen amen the one that are under
[2:45:44] the altar according to the Book of
[2:45:47] Revelation and one that are below
[2:45:51] according to the Book of
[2:45:53] Revelation got good news to you this
[2:45:56] morning I've got good news to you
[2:46:01] this the Bible says the
[2:46:05] one that the one that used to accuse
[2:46:11] you amen he's no longer doing it he's no
[2:46:15] longer have access there is no lying
[2:46:18] spirit there's no woman of endo that can
[2:46:21] raise
[2:46:22] samel let's read that scripture it's in
[2:46:25] Revelation chapter
[2:46:27] 10 it's my last
[2:46:35] scripture we read verse 10
[2:47:03] [Music]
[2:47:14] on the same
[2:47:17] script chapter 12 vers
[2:47:24] [Music]
[2:47:47] 10 amen amen I like it this is a
[2:47:52] consolation when the devil in the Old
[2:47:55] Testament as we read he used to go
[2:47:58] before God with many accusations you say
[2:48:02] brother is a good man but God this is
[2:48:06] what has done you say it's so and so he
[2:48:09] a sister but he has done so and she has
[2:48:12] done so and so his work was to look for
[2:48:16] the fault of the children of God so that
[2:48:19] he can put them before God but this
[2:48:21] moment this time this last Church age he
[2:48:26] doesn't do it anymore he has no access
[2:48:29] to Heaven anymore Heaven is for the
[2:48:31] children of God only that is why the
[2:48:33] Bible here says the one that used to
[2:48:36] accuse you day and night he been chased
[2:48:40] out he doesn't have access anymore when
[2:48:43] he want to say something the blood of
[2:48:46] Jesus Christ stand be between you and
[2:48:49] God you are no longer a sinner you are
[2:48:54] sinless you are spotless you are without
[2:48:58] drink before God because our Lord Jesus
[2:49:02] Christ di for us at the cross when he
[2:49:05] died for us on the cross he was cleaning
[2:49:10] everything amen so that this man devil
[2:49:15] must not accuse you against
[2:49:21] amen amen so he was doing that as the
[2:49:24] Bible says they
[2:49:26] in they out he was you know taking
[2:49:31] notes of your life and reported to God
[2:49:36] but God said to him don't
[2:49:40] accuse this little one because their
[2:49:43] face behold the face of the father we
[2:49:48] are with consolation today so in life
[2:49:52] there are certain things we can do there
[2:49:56] are certain things we cannot do let's
[2:49:59] wait for God to give us
[2:50:04] Direction amen amen I was talking about
[2:50:07] Judas the previous
[2:50:10] night amen amen Judas when you read his
[2:50:15] history he was a good man we see as a
[2:50:19] Badman
[2:50:20] today because we can read about him but
[2:50:24] those that of his time regarded him as a
[2:50:28] good man being as good as he are from
[2:50:31] the beginning he was a devil
[2:50:36] incarnate amen
[2:50:39] amen we today we live in another world
[2:50:44] social medias and so
[2:50:47] forth you see
[2:50:49] people
[2:50:55] espcially giving people monies in the
[2:51:00] malls others are happy say oh how good
[2:51:03] you I was
[2:51:07] starving and so forth and so forth and
[2:51:10] then when you look at those people for
[2:51:13] helping someone to have food on the
[2:51:15] table it shows how kind you are but let
[2:51:19] me tell you you will find the very same
[2:51:22] person is not good before
[2:51:26] God amen amen because somewhere
[2:51:30] somehow he made
[2:51:33] ritual with another person to enrich
[2:51:36] himself and have a lot of money and the
[2:51:40] condition was you shall give people
[2:51:44] money and another condition is you will
[2:51:48] must not even sleep with your
[2:51:50] wife and another condition is you will
[2:51:53] leave this snake in a special room
[2:51:57] there those things are happening don't
[2:52:00] just receive money and say this a good
[2:52:03] man that spirit of
[2:52:08] discernment Judas was
[2:52:10] there as good as he was but he was Dev
[2:52:15] incarnate one of the days Jesus were
[2:52:18] sitting on a
[2:52:19] table he said one will deceive me
[2:52:23] amongst
[2:52:24] you he never thought of
[2:52:26] Judas they thought of
[2:52:34] Peter
[2:52:36] yeah yes he's he's impulsive amen amen
[2:52:40] so they were thinking the only person
[2:52:42] that can do this is
[2:52:44] Peter but Peter had the keys of heaven
[2:52:49] then while they were looking to one
[2:52:51] another Jesus looked at Judas he said
[2:52:55] Judas do what is in your
[2:52:58] heart he knows the heart of
[2:53:01] Judas is the evil heart is the is the
[2:53:05] heart of the
[2:53:06] deceiver then Judas was like what is
[2:53:10] happening I won't do it you are my Lord
[2:53:14] you're looking after me but the spirit
[2:53:17] in Judas
[2:53:19] said do
[2:53:21] it when he took a
[2:53:24] bread and put in the ditch of
[2:53:28] Jesus he
[2:53:31] himself he didn't want to do it but
[2:53:34] something pull his hand and put it there
[2:53:38] to make the scripture to be fulfilled
[2:53:41] I'm I'm trying to tell you that you like
[2:53:43] it or not you might think you know the
[2:53:47] things of the world it's not you it's
[2:53:51] something in you that you cannot
[2:53:56] control I'm going to repeat this and
[2:53:59] take it home
[2:54:01] with wherever you are
[2:54:03] working whatever you are doing there is
[2:54:07] something that influence you to do
[2:54:11] whatever you want to do if you want to
[2:54:15] love you do not love somebody with love
[2:54:19] incarnate himself in you and you impact
[2:54:23] that
[2:54:24] love amen the reason why God put us here
[2:54:29] on Earth is to imp what is in us in our
[2:54:35] innermost because in US is soul and soul
[2:54:41] is part of God soul is an amate God it's
[2:54:46] our theop
[2:54:48] the one that behold the face of the
[2:54:52] father amen as a child of God you live
[2:54:56] like that so many times when you look at
[2:54:59] the people that are rich you wish you
[2:55:02] can be like
[2:55:03] them but you don't know what makes them
[2:55:06] be
[2:55:12] rich hence I'm saying if God gives you
[2:55:17] wealth you'll be wealthy respecting God
[2:55:21] but those that fight for it if they were
[2:55:25] not given by God they end end up killing
[2:55:28] people to make themselves
[2:55:33] rich is the life we are living today and
[2:55:39] there's nothing you can do because the
[2:55:42] people influenced by the devil the
[2:55:45] people influenced by the devil and the
[2:55:48] people influenced by God when those
[2:55:51] people meet they don't
[2:55:55] agree the reason why we are fighting in
[2:55:59] this world we are living in there's no
[2:56:03] peace there will never be peace and even
[2:56:06] the Bible says I did not bring peace I
[2:56:10] brought
[2:56:15] commotion the Mother-in-law will fight
[2:56:18] with
[2:56:20] brothers and sisters yes like that and
[2:56:22] the others will you know we normally
[2:56:24] preach
[2:56:25] it say it in our
[2:56:30] house why being siblings
[2:56:35] fight is us talking on a
[2:56:41] level you always try to
[2:56:44] reconcile you always try to bring things
[2:56:47] together
[2:56:48] but when you go beyond the
[2:56:51] flesh the siblings the
[2:56:55] siblings fight because in their
[2:56:59] innermost is different
[2:57:04] people are we together and then when we
[2:57:09] meet as children of God we meet because
[2:57:14] of what we
[2:57:16] have in US amen amen if myself and we go
[2:57:23] together that means we are in agreement
[2:57:25] because we believe in one thing the day
[2:57:29] one of us lost the touch of what we
[2:57:33] believe we
[2:57:36] fight Revelation 12 says from verse
[2:57:40] 7 there was a war in heaven and that war
[2:57:44] in heaven this Lucifer realized that he
[2:57:48] can do much than God you know all the
[2:57:53] assassinations caused by the very close
[2:57:56] people go and
[2:57:59] read yeah you cannot be be killed by The
[2:58:03] Stranger when you are closed with
[2:58:06] someone he study you in order to
[2:58:10] overthrown you you look at the president
[2:58:13] and the deputy president the deputy
[2:58:15] president want to be the president for
[2:58:18] him to be the president the president
[2:58:20] must go on pension if he doesn't go on
[2:58:23] pension he must eliminate
[2:58:27] him that why we have many
[2:58:30] churches because we do not want to be
[2:58:33] followers you all want to be pastor and
[2:58:37] if I don't get opportunity I do my
[2:58:41] own or if this pastor is so old he
[2:58:45] doesn't want to die how can I kill him
[2:58:54] I
[2:58:55] say they that wait upon the
[2:58:58] Lord just wait for God to work things
[2:59:03] for you David was up in the mountain
[2:59:06] there being forsaken by his own Nation
[2:59:10] being anointed by God himself but God
[2:59:15] dealt with the situation
[2:59:18] Saul was
[2:59:20] killed absum was killed David became the
[2:59:24] king he never fought them he did not
[2:59:27] kill them he just keep on praying for
[2:59:30] them he keep on saying ABS my son why
[2:59:34] you die before me I was supposed to be
[2:59:37] the one that you supposed to be the one
[2:59:41] that will bury me but now I'm buing you
[2:59:45] so the anointed man of God
[2:59:48] I love David so much he relied on God he
[2:59:53] let God do the work for him he didn't
[2:59:56] want to take things to the
[2:59:57] extreme and God fought all the fights of
[3:00:02] David they that wait upon the Lord amen
[3:00:06] amen and God made his
[3:00:10] kingom stronger and strong until all the
[3:00:14] kings we had in Israel until all the
[3:00:17] kings we
[3:00:19] there was never this one like David
[3:00:25] until the Bible says God loved David so
[3:00:29] much and David was the man after the
[3:00:33] heart of
[3:00:35] God may God richly
[3:00:37] bless amen amen let's sing a
[3:00:41] song and
[3:00:43] proceed to the
