Shalom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; The brothers will display their prayer request. &gt;&gt; I see my elder here. Dr. Mashabi as we ask him to come forth just to say a word of prayer [music] for all the request. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; tidings and offerings. If you have a request in your heart, just raise your hand and the Lord will bless you. As we say, touching Jesus all that really matters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Touching [music] Jesus is all [singing] that matters. And your [music] life and your life [singing] will never be [music] the same. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; There is only [music] there is only [singing] one [music] way to touch. &gt;&gt; Just believe. [singing] &gt;&gt; Just [music] believe when [singing] you call [music] on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Dear heavenly father, this morning we like to thank you for the opportunity father to come and gather in this fashion to gather in your house this morning [music] knowing father that you are the one who hold our destiny. That is what our prophet says. He says it gives us grace consolation to know that our destination is not in our hands but our destination is in your hands. That is why father we know that our life you have ordained it. Everything father that is happening in our life whether it's big challenges [music] whether it be tri victories you have ordained it so you have predestinated it that way. That is why this morning your children see it fit to come into their house this morning because they know that they don't have control over their life. You are the one who have control. That is why they say if they are sick they can come here. They will get healing. If they have a need, they can come here. You are their Jehovah Gyra. Because Father, you've never failed them. Each and every time they've gone [music] through trials, tribulation, you always manage to get them through. Even this morning, Father, you're just going to go and do the same. Cuz your word teaches us that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. You change not. Your word changes not. Even your promises change not. That is why this morning, Father, we say, Father, bless them, Father. those who are sick like sister Juma has brought his brother who's sick father he says here his hand is swollen but he knows that you are the great physician there's no physician greater than you you are not more than a physician father you have created man that's why you know each and every cell each and every molecule in the in his body that is why if there's something out of place you are the one who can put it in place if there's a disease in the place disease doesn't know you father it doesn't it only surren surreners to your power. That is why father we say father you give us a power of transformation from being sick to being healed. That is why this morning they've come father saying father you have healed them. That is why the word says by your stripes you are healed. Not that you are going to be healed. We were healed. It's in the past. That is why father the only thing we can come this morning father is to come and accept that healing. If we accept it and received it and believe it, you will grant it unto us father. That is why even this morning father we have our brother who wants a revelation of our word. What a great thing to be have a revelation of your word. It's so father please come and reveal yourself to him because your word is you. If he doesn't see you far he will never get your word because father you say father you will never leave us alone but you leave us with your word with your holy spirit to come and guide us. Even this morning father he wants guidance. That is what he needs. Exactly. Guidance of the Holy Spirit. So that when he goes through this life, he knows that whatever going he's going through, you are there with him. &gt;&gt; You are the one leading him. You are the one guiding him. That's what he needs. And that is what each and every one of us in here needs. Father, we come and pray and give this commit this service unto you. Commit the elders unto you. Commit the [music] the saints unto you. Even the word that we're going to receive it. Father, make us a vessel that's going to receive it. Father, prepare a ground in us, a fertile ground that when your word comes from you, Father, we will be able to receive it. We pray and believing in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

You can, you can, you can [music] my spirit my [music] soul. You can't kill my body. [music and singing] my soul. [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; God bless the children of God this morning. &gt;&gt; It's a great blessing to be here and and it's a privilege and honor as you know that I I think I have adjusted to African time now. taking a long trip hours difference takes a little of adjustment. But I believe that I've adjusted. I've had to adjust. I've had to adjust also to the fact that you drive on the left side of the road and you get into a car on the left side, not the right side. So, I've adjusted to that. I uh yesterday I decided to walk over to a little shopping plaza to buy a couple of things. And so, to get there, you have to walk upstairs, walk up steps and across and back down again. So what I did was I went over and I kind of held the the rail on the right side and I started walking down and somebody comes right up to my face. You've got to think left-handed. Get you know I went over to the other side and walked down. I knew I was on the right side there. Amen. &gt;&gt; But uh anyway, that's that's a minor adjustment I guess. Um, I was listening last week to brother Neo preaching his message. &gt;&gt; The plan of God is beyond the plan of man. Now that had some personal significance to me, especially I just want to tell you that my own experience and and what happened to me in So, as I was listening to service, see, I I used to stream in the middle of the night. I found out that when you get up in the middle of the night, you get a little bit older, it's hard to stay awake. I would be streaming. I would be streaming and trying to stay awake. And then next thing I was so so I realized, you know, if I really want to get the essence of what's being preached here, I need to be able to stream the service and be able to get every bit of it at the, you know, at the time it's being brought as best I can. So I do stream some of those things after the fact. But but his his particular message was significant to me because as I thought about it, there was a certain scripture that came to my mind. &gt;&gt; And uh those things don't happen very often for me, but when they do, I really pay attention to them. And [music] um I wanted to just share that with you briefly uh if I could here. Um and you'll understand why it was significant to me. [music] The scripture was taken from James chapter 4 &gt;&gt; and I'm going to read these scriptures here uh verses 13- 15. Verse 13 says, "Go to now, you that say, [music] today or tomorrow, we will go into such a city, and we will continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain." That's the plan of man. That's the plan of man. Okay. Verse 14. &gt;&gt; Whereas you know not what shall be on the tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appearth for a little time and then vanishes. And this is this next scripture is the one that stood out to me. You'll understand for that the fact that your life is just like a vapor for that say if the Lord will live and do this or that. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the will of God prevails the circumstances are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The will of God prevails. Um, the will of man, the will of man on my trip to take a flight from from Fort Walton where I live, &gt;&gt; leave in the afternoon at 400 p.m., which would be 1600 hours your time, and arrive here [music] the next day at 700 p.m. That would have been real convenient because I would have slept through the night on the plane, been somewhat rested, and then adjusted a little bit more than I had to do. But that's not the way it turned out. Because what happened was that first plane that was supposed to take me to Atlanta, &gt;&gt; that plane had a mechanical problem. They were not able to repair it without having a certain part that was going to have to be brought in. So what happened was I ended up leaving just after midnight, &gt;&gt; getting into Atlanta about 1:30 in the morning. Then they gave us they put us up in a motel or a hotel rather &gt;&gt; and uh the next day my plans had been totally completely changed. The next day I ended up going to Amsterdam and that that was an eight hour flight over and we got in Amsterdam at six o'clock in the morning and then I turned around and caught the next plane here at about 10, &gt;&gt; which put me in to the airport at Johannesburg at 10:00 p.m. at night. So, I got here, but I didn't get here glory to the plan of man. Uh, but I'm grateful to be here just before I went on this trip. Some of you who I have met and spoken with personally, you know that my occupation, my occupation is that I'm a plumber. So, I work in people's homes. And over the past week, people have said u I've told people I'm going on vacation. I'll be gone for a little while. So they say, "Oh, where are you going?" &gt;&gt; And uh I said, "I'm going to South Africa." Oh, you know, people, oh, South Africa, you know, safaris and all those. And so I told them I said I said I was invited to South Africa. &gt;&gt; I was invited to come and join &gt;&gt; about 3 months ago in October. I took a flight and went up to the state of North Carolina because I have a family that lives there. And uh I spent a week there. And as I was getting ready to leave, I had my bags packed. I was getting ready to go to the airport and my phone rings and I I thought, "Who is this calling me?" And I looked and it was a video calls &gt;&gt; from brother Tibogo. [music] Oh, he says, "Oh, brother Gabrielson." And he takes his phone and goes around and here's brother Encadma sitting in his chair sitting at his seat with some other brothers sitting next to him, Brother Edgar and Brother Neil sitting there. And he says, "Oh," he says, "Uh, I wanted to invite you to come to the convention this year." And I said, "Oh," I said, "I didn't I didn't think I was going to get an invitation." I said, "I know that with him being in and out of the hospital, all the things that are going on here, they have enough to keep themselves occupied without me coming over there and being somebody else they have to look after." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, but he said, "Oh, no." He said, "I can't imagine you not being invited to come." &gt;&gt; I was very honored with that. I got my plane ticket immediately. &gt;&gt; Weeks, a couple of weeks later, brother Encadma went to be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I was a little shocked at that, but I and saddened as well. &gt;&gt; But they kept my plans intact for me [music] to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm very thankful for that. Uh I think very highly of you here. I just want you to know that. &gt;&gt; Amen. this this [music] this assembly. Praise God for for the fact that uh children of God here. I love you all very much and I'm thankful to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we clap hands for the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. I also have lost and found a very nice smartphone. [music] They left it outside at the water pool today. As we stand on our feet [music] to welcome Pastor Maka. Amen. Amen. Oh, [music] thanks. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, we have greetings here. &gt;&gt; You may be seated for a while. &gt;&gt; Can Can you read the greetings for us, my brother? &gt;&gt; We have got greetings from the saints.

Thank you my my brother, &gt;&gt; my elder. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Um, I'm going to introduce things here. &gt;&gt; But before I start, &gt;&gt; I want to warn young sisters and young brothers. Um, they must not be drunk when they get into marriage. There must be sober because if you make a promise according to the prophet, you have already married. Just like the Bible says to Joseph, Bible says Mary was the wife of Joseph but they were not married. They have just proposed each other. So because in future when there is a divorce in court the pastor who married those couples will be called to court. Are you listening my brother? They say we'll be called to court.

We are going back to our last Sunday scripture um Matthew 16 13- 20 &gt;&gt; verse 13 to 20 &gt;&gt; and Colossians 1 verse 18 only Matthews chapter 16 from verse 13 to 20 When Jesus came into the coast of Cicia, Philillip, he asked his disciples, saying, "Whom do men say that I, the son of man, am?" And they said, "Some say that thou are John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremiah's or one of the prophets." He said unto them, "But whom say ye that I am?" And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God?" And Jesus answered and said unto them unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. [music] And whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Then charge he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. Colossians chapter 1 verse 18. &gt;&gt; Colossians chapter 1 verse 18. Verse 18. And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you give Mike pray for this bow our heads? Dear heavenly father, thou creator of all heavens here this morning father, we have read from your holy spir scriptures a word that you spoke in the beginning. Father we pray as we have gathered to together today under this great ministry of revealing yourself among us through your word. Here's our pastor standing before us. Father, we pray for that the spirit, that road, the word may be able to take this word [music] and direct it to each and every heart of us so that you may manifest yourself in us. We have heard, we have read, Lord, that you said you'll build your church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. That church is built upon the revelation of who you are in these last days. &gt;&gt; Father, we commit ourself. We want ask you Lord to come and have preminence preminence. [music] Come and manifest yourself. Come and express yourself. We are expecting your vindication Lord &gt;&gt; that all of us when we live in this place we can say surely God has spoken with us. &gt;&gt; We ask all these blessings in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may take your seats. I've heard that my comrade GMA is here. I also extend my greetings to him. Um I believe the technical team will um show the uh the power of transformation there. Wow. Our topic today is God building his church is is part two. I said I will I'm going to come back. Where is it? He said the same thing. It is about having a church here in the last days. He is going to have a bride. He's able of these stones to children to Abraham. If we don't follow him, he will get somebody else that will follow him. He is going to a happy eat because he has already spoken. Whatever he says, it has to be that way. It cannot change. It must come forth the way because he said it. He's the one who is going to build his church. He is the one who has built his church. He said &gt;&gt; his church is his body. &gt;&gt; And he said he is the head &gt;&gt; of his body, the church. &gt;&gt; He is the cornerstone and he is also the headstone. In other words, this church is a church of stones because if he is a cornerstone, the other stone must be the other building material must be stones. We can just show me something there. And God's provided place of worship. It says there and upon this comes stone stone upon in each age. In other words, because he is building this church through seven church age. In other words, he's building this church. You see that's why it says upon this come stone in each age that the word that is coming up just exactly as Jesus did in his age which is the capstone it all. In him laid every age. If you can understand that, you understand everything. He is building himself. He is building his body himself. If if you look at the church, &gt;&gt; it is himself been revealed step by step until it comes to the last church age. When he is building his church, he use he he used he built it through seven churches. using seven stars which are called seven messengers. And those seven messengers, they are called seven eyes. My brother, can you read Revelation chapter 5? Then uh my technical team there will uh flesh another quote there &gt;&gt; which we're going to read chapter 5 then we read verse um verse Five and verse six. &gt;&gt; Verse six. &gt;&gt; Verse six only. &gt;&gt; And I beheld and law in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts. And in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. He says this lamp has got seven horns. Seven horns. On each horn there is an eye. And it says those eyes are seven spirits of God sent to all the world. You see an eye. &gt;&gt; The prophet says if you if they reflect the the bridge, &gt;&gt; the prophet says there, an eye, there is it. There are seven eyes. Eyes means seen. See means prophets. This lamp had seven horns. Each horn had an eye. Seven eyes. What is it? Christ, &gt;&gt; his bride, seven church ages. Out of there was seven prophets that went forth. Seven SE eyes. So the last one must also be a seer. In other words, when he was building this church, because he was building himself, the Bible says that he he used seven eyes which are seven messengers which are seven spirits which are called seven messengers. When when we read chapter 4 We shall come back. &gt;&gt; Chapter 4:5. &gt;&gt; Revelation 4:5. And out of the throne proceedth lightning and thunderings and voices, and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. &gt;&gt; In heaven, there are seven spirits. When you pass the zodiac, then you find stars. The same spirits in heaven. When you pass the zodiac, there are seven stars. When you come down here on earth, the same seven spirits, there are seven star. There are seven messengers. That's why they are called the spirit of God. It's not it is not seven spirits. It is one spirit of God. When it is used seven times in seven men then we call it seven spirits. But it is one spirit of God which started to work in the first generation. through the first messenger and to the second church, through the second messenger. That is the same spirit of God. And those those messengers they were building his church. Those in each age, God predestinated a messenger there. And under each messenger from the first church age, there is a messenger. The seven the second church age there is a messenger. But in each church age and each messenger there are pastors there. If you can uh flash the seven church ages 256 church ages paragraph 256 page 256 paragraph 76. Paragraph 76 until just just to help you that under each messenger there are pastors they are ordained to be under each messenger because they have got the same spirit with the messenger. They will take from the messenger bring to the sheep. They will not bring their own thing because they are connected with the messenger there because the messenger is connected with God because perhaps they don't have it there. He was the rock confession in each church age. Who was the raw confession? I said God is building his church. He is building his body. He is the head of his body. He He is He was there in the first church age. He was revealing himself through seven church ages step by step. He was the rock confession. in each age. In each age, he is he was the rock and he has to be confessed in that in that age. He he had that age has to receive the revelation who that rock is. Amen. And if and that H can't miss that because that H has got a messenger which is connected to the rock because he is part of that rock then he is bringing that's why the prophet says the messengers are making Christ known to the church in that age a messenger is making Christ in other words is revealing Christ to that age those who are from his they will recognize him &gt;&gt; because he those messengers are only sent to to to introduce him because he is the rock confession. Peter confessed that rock thou art Christ. He was conf he was confessing about that rock. And in each age is the same rock. They must be confessed. Then you when those who confess that rock that the Bible says they are blessed. [cheering and applause] If they can't confess that rock then they are not part of it. Let me just try to read this because in this book of mine here perhaps I will find it. It says here &gt;&gt; that is history. &gt;&gt; Now God kept rising up. Are you together with me? from the first church age, God himself rising up because you are a little stone. You are part of that big stone. That's why there was a song by pastor. We used to see we said this seven thunder message is moving just like a magnet is is is moving there and it's moving there is moving that like just like a magnet because it is just attracting it attracting it. Then this rock is magnetized and then you by predestination Because you have got a small stone which is placed in you and that stone is magnetized to daddy is a magnet. You are magnetized to your pastor and your pastor is magnetized to the messenger. Amen. Then that is a magnet building that stone at that age. He say what he says. God keep raising up not only the messenger to each age but he he raised up some wonderful helpers for those messengers. In other words in each age hell. All right. They will say where does this man get this thing from? But let me read blasphemous name. I think they have there. If they don't know &gt;&gt; blasphemous names they should have &gt;&gt; um blasphemia's name is page um um it's paragraph 119. &gt;&gt; Blasphemia's names paragraph one they have. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that has been each h has had the rock confession on up to this rock confession of theian churches. It has been a rock confession going on. until this is then it says here in paragraph 30 130 &gt;&gt; paragraph 130 &gt;&gt; it says book &gt;&gt; each one of these age had that rock confession if if you understand this if you understand these things you will understand a white rock Inside the pyramid pyramid each age there is a rock confession in that age. Then it says here it can be each one of these ages have that raw confession and the saints are sleeping with that raw confession in them waiting waiting waiting until this age. In this age, there is a a a a gathering of the rocks. Those who died with the rock confession in this age now from west and east. They are gathering in this headstone. Are you are you are you with me there? &gt;&gt; It says here seven. All right. It says um seven ages is his booty and he is his church. And it says his church Christ is the mystery of God revealed paragraph 252 revealed &gt;&gt; is himself revealed. In other words, in the age you are living now, if you want to know his church, because his church is himself revealed. He has been revealing. He has been revealing himself from the first church age until now. That is the completion. It says there his church is himself revealed. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you see it? And expressed by the the way he said He is God. &gt;&gt; That is the church that he is building. &gt;&gt; Isaiah says you must remember the stone you are healed from. &gt;&gt; You are healed from a stone. And when you are healed there, you left a space there and you go back to a space. [applause] That's why they say remember. You remember where you come from. You feed. He is the hidden man. I'm talking about the Christ who is building his church, who is building his his body, who is building himself in each age. He is the hidden man. That's why I said he is the rock of fashion. He is he is the revelation in that age. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the hidden man. &gt;&gt; The prophet said &gt;&gt; after the mana was hidden in the hol of holies they were accessed by the high priests to ones. But he said after God now in every church age the mana is is brought back to the church. He said just like when Jesus was feeding the multitude. He took the bread and break it and gave it to the disciples. And the disciples in gave it to the those who are sitting down. He said in each age, Christ himself &gt;&gt; takes the mana and gave it to the messenger and the messenger takes the mana and gave it to us because they are hidden. Only the messenger is able to go and take the hidden man. for that generation for that age and that generation that man are are enough for that age that age cannot say I would have I would have lived in Paul's age the manner for Paul's age was enough the manner for Paul's age. They have got the the the the rapturing power in them. Those who have received that man in age in age in Paul's age they slept with the rapture in faith because in each age there is a portion you can't say I would have lived because your age has a portion for you he is a hidden Because in this age now God said to the prophet store the food because there is coming fine. This is the time of femite hear what the people are saying. See the what the people are trying to preach because it's femite. They don't know what to say but they want to say something. That's what the Bible says. You will see beautifully young men and girls going this way and that way looking for food but not food but food which is the word of God. Yeah. what the people are saying outside because this is the time of famine. You see beautiful pictures trying to bring something but they have nothing to give [applause and cheering] because this is the time of hidden man. In each age they were taking taking part. &gt;&gt; But in our age we have we have taken the whole because nothing should be left. We take even the container. He is all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The sketch there. &gt;&gt; You see those are seven church age. You see on top there is a capstone and is a pyramid between the seven church ages below there because from the first church age which is Ephesus to the last church age which is which is the We are no more living in Amen. The prophet says we are living in the bride age because the message has taken us and place us in another. You can you can look at the seat &gt;&gt; when it cruise start from the blade and the stock and now the shark. The time will come when the shock will open so that the the seat can be in direct contact. with the sun. &gt;&gt; Now it's no more the age of the shark has thrived. Now it's time for the whole life. The leaves, the the roots, the leaves, the stocks are now back into that seat. You cannot see them, but they are there. Everything they are there in the sea. That is the age you are living in. We are living in the city age. And there the the prophet says in this book he said between because from the first church age to the church age is the dispensation of the son of God. And he said between the dispensation of the son of God because the son of David it will be in the millennium. He said between there in other words between there is where there is that headstone that is between there and where there is that headstone where the son of man is revealed in other ways the headstone is the revelation of the son of man. Amen. Because that is where he is revealed between the son of God. Not during the son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; When somebody says you are in love is just laugh at him &gt;&gt; because there in other words he means the son of man is not revealed because the son of man is revealed above of the son of god. between the son of God and the son of David. &gt;&gt; The son of man is revealed. Where is where is your because the son of man now is revealed above. That is what the prophet says that the son of man is a full seat. &gt;&gt; That is the the dispensation we are living in. He says we are feeding with the body weight of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is the hidden man. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; There are seven supernatural angels. who came and picked the seven our our messenger &gt;&gt; into their own pyramid. Bring it back. They bring that our seven angel messenger into that pyramid. That one which is called love is the pyramid of the seven supernatural and which ke it kept the this this physical but inside of this one there is a sto that one is a is the pyramid of the supernatural angels keeping this one because those seven supernatural angels wrote the book. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I do. We have seven supernatural angels and we have seven physical angels which we know Paul and these are seven physical angels but we have got seven supernatural which are the supernatural bodies of the seven physical angels. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they came &gt;&gt; and kept this the &gt;&gt; pyramid. [cheering and applause] Take it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Take it. &gt;&gt; Let me say something. Let me something. All right. &gt;&gt; In this book shalom. &gt;&gt; In the book shalom. &gt;&gt; Just exit like he showed us the seven church ages. Are you listening? Just just exit like he showed us the seven church ages. What it would come? How they would come? Seven church ages. And just exactly what he showed us, what would come when he said that light up there in a revelation to it to show the world. When he sent the seven angels to reveal the seven messengers, these supernatural angels, they came to reveal the seven that had been down through there and show the loose ends. each angel coming each day and revealing the loose ends that Luther left. In other words, this the supernatural Buddha of Luther came and reveal what Luda left. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All those seven supernatural angels &gt;&gt; together they represent Christ. &gt;&gt; All of them together &gt;&gt; they represented Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me read this book here all of them. &gt;&gt; Not one because some will say the notable one is Christ which they were wrong. If that one is Christ the other I say we are living in the time of hunger. They're just picking whatever they could find in front of them. I left here &gt;&gt; by vision &gt;&gt; to go to Tusan to see what the Lord wanted me to do. There he met me there at he met me up there. He went to Tusa. The Lord met him up there as he told you. He as as he told you here that he would do it in the form of seven angels. Who made him? The Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; In what form? The &gt;&gt; form of angels. Amen. &gt;&gt; They are the they are they were the ones &gt;&gt; who kept the pyramid in that in that pyramid of seven supernatural end. I am represented there. You are represented. When when finished according to Junior Jackson, he opened the the the last part there and inside there was a white stone. What is that? He's scratched himself. Hallelujah. Because we say in each age is a hidden man. &gt;&gt; No one would know who he is. If something is hidden is hidden by the owner and is the owner who can reveal it to you. That's the reason He said, "I went west and coming back, I came back with the interpretation of the white stone which is Christ." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord meet me there in the form of seven angels and said, &gt;&gt; return back in the form of seven angels and said to me, return back and said, and the seven seals was to be open." That is just exactly what happened. You see sometime brother said I feel checked. &gt;&gt; I'm not checked by anybody. I check by myself. I feel I feel my time is over. But let me just read some quotes in this book of it is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; I don't want to take a long time but let me read it. I don't know whether they will reflect it there or not. Is the It is the rising of the sun. It is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; It says here &gt;&gt; there is it. &gt;&gt; Look what we have seen in this day. &gt;&gt; The quickening power has come to us to open the seven seats.
