oh all right God bless you thank you [Music] very much [Music] [Music] each other they shut down the same amen you may be seated sisters the spoken word is the original seat here is the book it is so shall my weight be is which one lipi that goeth a lipoma out of my mouth not any other way I know my lip is there can be the words there can be some preachings he says social my way be that because out of my mouth it shall not return unto me again I'm in I remember one day Queenstown and I my brother there were residing there that evening I thought Lord foreign [Music] is then I said all right so shall my weight be that goeth forth out of my mouth then I said Lord there's a request here and I was thinking that how am I going to what am I going to preach about it now finally these people are your beings your sons that he said to the Lord these people are yours if you pray your presence do not remain with us we shall not foreign if God has noticed promise to speak don't move [Music] amen so now I had a special message last time they asked me to come to continue uh what was it remember the message going in no no no you are still here I'm talking about us the last message we preached there um [Music] okay clingy no all right so I had to change to this now talk about it you know he came as air some mediator I I I won't say you'll be surprised to know that we are going to read where he is no longer a mediator um [Music] when we hit that place again speak about this word yeah God has spoken now I want to read from the spoken word is the original seat is page 29. a paper I don't know because sometimes here is the word lying here now what happened here is the weight now is the word that God spoke to multiply and replenish the Earth it couldn't find a place now amen and now what God spoke was moving please I wonder why we are preaching here is the word finding a place now because the world has a place [Music] amen and beauty you should be the place of the way will read in the Bible that David was a place of the words [Music] and God is of the day is a place amen when it is all right now finally says when I speak about God's Prophet I want you to know which one um this word it caught into lilies meaning this word was traveling from back there and when it couldn't find a place the first woman because a place it must find a place amen because God it's not speaking out he is not not speaking alone amen no teasing and that is God can come into you bodily he comes in the word form amen I'm that's why Inga Court wants to talk to us in this age [Music] and he will dwell he will come into that place my sheep know my voice is you will know that men speaking is his voice that's why if you think it says it's a after he was rejected [Music] then he went for individuals [Music] yeah that's after the auditions he was rejected if the people foreign [Music] If any man share my voice is now there's so many voices even in here you should know the voice of God If any man um and he opens the doors okay [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] with if whatever language is [Music] true in the womb of a vision comes came forth they came of Life the sin that let us that the canal [Music] produce itself they are amen [Applause] now from here there is another pictures concerning this is I was reading here you look at this women last we were looking at Sarah how

people that are operating Beyond time you even listen to their Ministry [Music] speaks of times now I will pick up another one look at the things foreign to the leaders we were in him we are in him then we've been in him we are still varied to the religionists of the world [Music] foreign we are still failed to them outside us because you have outside us and outside there is also a worshiper also an Insider I mean inside us they think we are crazy then let me continue we are invited into him foreign and people here we even say naughty will ask him almost Hebrews chapter 4 [Music] verse how far it can take us let us therefore fear last a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it For unto us was the Gospel priest as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that had it for we which yet have believed do enter into rest as he has said as I have sown in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world Amen The Works were finished yeah from there foundation of the world Soca a Allen was right amen that's what we are
