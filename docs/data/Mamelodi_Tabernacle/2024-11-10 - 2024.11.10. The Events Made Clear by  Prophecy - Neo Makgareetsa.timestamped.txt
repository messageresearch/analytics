[1:16:22] dreams where withth his Spirit was was
[1:16:25] troubled and his sleep break from him
[1:16:28] then the king commanded to call The

[1:16:37] the childin for to show the king his
[1:16:41] dreams so they came and stood before the

[1:16:50] troubled to know the dream then spake
[1:16:54] the children to the king in Sak oh King

[1:17:12] me the dream with the interpretation
[1:17:14] thereof he shall be cut in pieces and

[1:19:14] time uh while waiting for the
[1:19:19] rapture we will come to the church and D
[1:19:22] together
[1:19:25] so my title this
[1:19:27] morning will be about the events made
[1:19:30] clear by
[1:19:34] prophecy because we realize that we live
[1:19:39] in a prophetic
[1:19:43] world so the prophecies were always
[1:19:47] there their Visions were always there
[1:19:51] their dreams were always there as just
[1:19:55] read
[1:19:56] here where the Bible says nebz had a
[1:20:01] dream and he forgot that
[1:20:04] dream so he made it clear to the
[1:20:08] people that I had a dream that was
[1:20:11] troubling me but I forgot
[1:20:15] it so when he called these
[1:20:18] people the
[1:20:22] magician the astrologers
[1:20:25] as
[1:20:28] Sans he explained to them thoroughly
[1:20:33] that I had a dream but I
[1:20:35] for helped me out because uh you have
[1:20:39] been enjoying the benefit of being next
[1:20:41] to the
[1:20:43] king doing nothing now you must
[1:20:47] work have you ever come to that
[1:20:51] situation at work you employer
[1:20:56] saying I've been paying you for many
[1:21:00] years but now you must
[1:21:05] work now same thing here he told them
[1:21:10] they must work
[1:21:11] now now when they come to him they said
[1:21:15] to
[1:21:16] him well we have heard you but give us
[1:21:20] the dream we will give you the
[1:21:22] interpretation
[1:21:25] the look at
[1:21:29] them taking me for
[1:21:32] gred I repeat it many times I forgot the
[1:21:37] dream you must tell me the
[1:21:39] dream I
[1:21:41] forgot and after telling me the
[1:21:45] dream you tell me the
[1:21:50] interpretation it was difficult
[1:21:57] they usually say even their knes
[1:21:59] couldn't cut anything they didn't have
[1:22:07] [Music]
[1:22:09] direction must work over
[1:22:11] time they must go and call their gods
[1:22:16] and get everything
[1:22:18] together to make a presentation before
[1:22:22] the
[1:22:23] king and then they went back to the King
[1:22:27] again they said
[1:22:29] King give us the
[1:22:31] dream we we will give you the
[1:22:34] interpretation read the whole chapter as
[1:22:36] it goes down was a communication between
[1:22:39] them and the
[1:22:41] K and the King said now I'm no longer
[1:22:45] going to talk with
[1:22:46] you I must just write a letter the king
[1:22:50] wrote a
[1:22:51] letter and said call all those
[1:22:55] people the wise men in Babylon the
[1:23:00] magician the
[1:23:11] [Music]
[1:23:16] astrologer men and the children the king
[1:23:19] said call all of them and kill each and
[1:23:23] everyone
[1:23:26] that was the instruction from
[1:23:29] King he said so now they knew they're
[1:23:33] going to die and then they were
[1:23:37] directionless but they knew that there's
[1:23:39] a
[1:23:41] God in
[1:23:43] Israel they came together and said guys
[1:23:47] here we are going to die we don't want
[1:23:49] to die let's just swallow our pride
[1:23:54] there's a man who can help us preserve
[1:23:58] our
[1:23:59] life and then they went to that man by
[1:24:03] the name of Daniel Daniel saw them
[1:24:05] coming and they communicate with him
[1:24:09] amen you know I always say we can all be
[1:24:12] the children of God but our characters
[1:24:15] are not the
[1:24:16] same but we are the child of God we work
[1:24:20] for the kingdom Daniel was a kind man
[1:24:24] when when they throw him into the lion's
[1:24:28] there he was he was just
[1:24:31] singing must Jesus be the
[1:24:34] cross he was there and then God preserve
[1:24:39] his life now when these people from
[1:24:43] Babylon come
[1:24:45] to and then he sat down with them then
[1:24:49] they were explaining their
[1:24:51] story being kind and soft kind of a
[1:24:53] character
[1:24:55] he looked at them he listened to them
[1:24:59] and he responded to
[1:25:02] them the king is
[1:25:05] cruel when I'm looking at you I just see
[1:25:09] copses and he's going to know that
[1:25:13] wasel in a soft
[1:25:17] way help us we know that our
[1:25:24] our tricks
[1:25:29] help
[1:25:31] all help us here you Daniel you are the
[1:25:34] only solution of our
[1:25:37] life Daniel was just a smiley
[1:25:41] brother then he said
[1:25:45] brother as I am you can see I'm just
[1:25:47] like you but I'll try
[1:25:51] man let me ask my God
[1:25:55] because your
[1:25:57] God has
[1:26:01] failed and then Daniel went to see the
[1:26:05] king he said King as you have
[1:26:10] consulted with the
[1:26:12] sorer the magician the
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:17] astrologers let me as well consult then
[1:26:22] I will come back to you
[1:26:25] in life we live in a life of
[1:26:29] consultation don't lie to me that's how
[1:26:33] we live you cannot go
[1:26:36] forth without
[1:26:38] consulting but it depends to whom you
[1:26:43] concern you cannot be a
[1:26:45] loner you will be lying to us there's
[1:26:49] somewhere somehow where you will need
[1:26:53] help like it or not so Daniel said to
[1:26:56] him when you
[1:26:58] consult to those let me
[1:27:02] consult to this then I'll come back to
[1:27:05] you the king said go and come
[1:27:11] back those wise people of
[1:27:19] Babylon they were really thinking should
[1:27:21] but you know how was built
[1:27:24] you cannot run away there were Chariot
[1:27:27] on the you know on the
[1:27:29] walls there were security all over the
[1:27:32] place and the King told them that no one
[1:27:37] goes out no one comes in just make sure
[1:27:42] everything is in place these people have
[1:27:46] been long paying them they must work
[1:27:49] today
[1:27:54] just you know because we read we have
[1:27:57] that mentality of reading we were not
[1:28:00] there it becomes an easy thing it was
[1:28:03] not
[1:28:05] in imagine this morning the soldiers
[1:28:08] surround this
[1:28:11] Tabernacle but today you are not going
[1:28:14] out until we get 1 2 3 otherwise we kill
[1:28:19] all of you
[1:28:24] that's when you'll know who are the real
[1:28:27] Christians
[1:28:29] because because one will go to the
[1:28:32] soldiers say actually me I wasn't
[1:28:35] actually fellowshipping
[1:28:38] here even my wife for me to marry
[1:28:41] her she's the one who told me about the
[1:28:44] message but I'm just saying just excuse
[1:28:50] me when when the squeeze come
[1:28:54] will know the color of the
[1:29:00] people let the youth they will say is
[1:29:04] the
[1:29:12] parents
[1:29:15] while actually we not believe in this is
[1:29:19] an exit exit
[1:29:22] strategy when you face
[1:29:25] death you become real
[1:29:31] you
[1:29:32] now Daniel was a smiley
[1:29:36] brother then he said to
[1:29:38] Nebuchadnezzar I come back to you he
[1:29:41] said to the witches and the magician
[1:29:45] I'll come back to you but
[1:29:48] up and then he go he said Lord God here
[1:29:53] is the situ
[1:29:54] sitation for us to be known to Babylon
[1:30:00] is when you can come down and show these
[1:30:05] people that there's a God in
[1:30:10] Israel that was Daniel and then God said
[1:30:15] as you said as as you
[1:30:19] said as my son is my obligation
[1:30:24] to come down and
[1:30:27] answer hallelujah amen you know it was
[1:30:31] not an easy
[1:30:33] moment God answered
[1:30:36] Daniel after answering Daniel took him
[1:30:40] back to the king and the King get the
[1:30:45] answer amen amen let's
[1:30:47] read the very same chapter
[1:30:50] 2 we will read from verse 31 chapter 2
[1:30:53] from vers
[1:30:54] until 35 35 we'll go
[1:31:01] on thou oh King sawest and behold a
[1:31:05] great image this great great image whose
[1:31:08] brightness was excellent stood before
[1:31:11] thee and that and the form thereof was
[1:31:15] terrible this image's head was of fine
[1:31:18] gold his breast and his arms of silver
[1:31:21] his belly and his thighs of brass
[1:31:24] his legs of iron his feet part of iron
[1:31:27] and part of clay thou sawest till that a
[1:31:31] stone was cut out without hands which
[1:31:35] smed the image upon his feet that were
[1:31:38] of iron and clay and break them to
[1:31:41] Pieces then was the iron the clay the
[1:31:44] brass the silver and the gold broken to
[1:31:47] pieces together and became like the C
[1:31:51] the cuff of the summer threshing flaws
[1:31:55] and the the wind carried them away that
[1:31:59] no place was found for them and the
[1:32:02] stone that SM the image became a great
[1:32:04] mountain and filled the whole earth amen
[1:32:07] amen amen that was the
[1:32:10] dream and it ends there and then Daniel
[1:32:14] gave it to the
[1:32:16] king the sarus The Magicians the Chans
[1:32:22] and all of them they were listening as
[1:32:27] Daniel you know give the king the
[1:32:31] dream so in fact the
[1:32:34] king saw from his
[1:32:37] kingdom being the king of
[1:32:40] babyon until to the end of the
[1:32:44] world when he was looking at this you
[1:32:47] know
[1:32:49] dream it troubled him and he did not
[1:32:52] understand
[1:32:55] amen amen when he was talking to these
[1:33:01] people it was there was a moment where
[1:33:03] they were answering the
[1:33:05] king saying to
[1:33:07] him no one in this world who can give
[1:33:12] you the answer of your dream and what
[1:33:16] you dreamed about they were saying that
[1:33:18] to
[1:33:19] him the only person that can give you
[1:33:23] the answer
[1:33:24] is God who does not
[1:33:27] live in this
[1:33:30] world amen amen so last last week last
[1:33:35] Sunday I was
[1:33:37] in I was

[1:34:57] situation but to my
[1:35:01] surprise when they say I must talk when

[1:35:59] something in you that is so
[1:36:02] special Even in our family we do not
[1:36:06] have how come it was
[1:36:10] noisy
[1:36:11] confusion lot of things that were not
[1:36:13] going right but when we talk everything
[1:36:17] come to
[1:36:19] a then I said to him I don't know
[1:36:23] amen amen now it reminded me when I was
[1:36:28] saying the presence of God became the
[1:36:31] present of
[1:36:33] me I want to tell the church this
[1:36:36] morning your present is the present of
[1:36:40] God wherever you go whatever you are
[1:36:44] doing is God doing
[1:36:50] it that is why the witches
[1:36:54] the sorcerers the child they could know
[1:36:57] where is the
[1:36:59] solution of their life they realized
[1:37:02] that the Pres of God is with Daniel they
[1:37:07] went to Daniel and Daniel rescued them
[1:37:11] wherever you are going the whole
[1:37:13] interage of
[1:37:15] Heaven all the
[1:37:17] Angels they with
[1:37:20] you don't doubt don't doubt
[1:37:24] yourself God is piing you
[1:37:27] up yes we are human beings full of
[1:37:32] mistakes but the whole Heaven is piing
[1:37:36] you up and the people will tell
[1:37:42] you the witches here the the wise people
[1:37:46] here the S here they told Daniel we know
[1:37:52] you have the solution
[1:37:54] of this problem they even said to
[1:37:57] Daniel imagine Daniel we are dead our
[1:38:02] wives our kids our relative the king
[1:38:07] said he will kill them how are you going
[1:38:10] to feel Daniel are you still going to go
[1:38:13] to heaven not helping us seeing us been
[1:38:17] killed a smiley
[1:38:19] Daniel just say I will see what I can do
[1:38:23] but my God will answer and we see God
[1:38:28] answering Daniel and he gave him the
[1:38:31] dream and he said King the dream that
[1:38:35] bothered you is this then NE said
[1:38:41] yes and now see this is what I dream
[1:38:45] this has troubled me I do not understand
[1:38:49] then he went back to the
[1:38:51] sorcerers the Charan
[1:38:54] the the the witches I say here is the
[1:38:57] dream give me the
[1:38:59] explanation they couldn't
[1:39:04] explain the answer of what is happening
[1:39:10] before now and
[1:39:12] later go it's
[1:39:16] go if you have God you have the answer
[1:39:20] for every solution
[1:39:24] then the King was looking at them you
[1:39:27] said to me you want the dream you'll
[1:39:30] give me the explanation or the
[1:39:32] interpretation now Daniel has given me
[1:39:35] the dream interpret it for
[1:39:38] me they couldn't understand because it
[1:39:41] was a prophetic
[1:39:45] dream you know in life we are not the
[1:39:48] same we are not in the same
[1:39:51] level even us as human being our
[1:39:55] intelligences are not the same even the
[1:39:58] cars are not the
[1:40:01] same as I was saying the other day this
[1:40:04] friend of mine was driving Uno fire no
[1:40:08] no was
[1:40:13] Master then he said to me
[1:40:27] then I
[1:40:28] smile yes because they were driving 80
[1:40:32] km when you drive 140 you do like this
[1:40:36] why you
[1:40:37] could of
[1:40:39] ml if he can say now let me go you are
[1:40:45] the will come
[1:40:50] out because the power and your power are
[1:40:55] not the
[1:40:56] same even in the church we are not the
[1:40:59] same you like it or not we are children
[1:41:02] of God we are not the same we cannot be
[1:41:06] the same you go to heaven the angels are
[1:41:11] not the same they will never be the
[1:41:14] same when there is war Gabriel can try
[1:41:19] he will not win until M com
[1:41:23] they are not
[1:41:25] equal don't think we are equal there are
[1:41:28] certain problems you yourself and your
[1:41:32] friends and your relatives they cannot
[1:41:35] solve they cannot solve until you go to
[1:41:39] your pastor and say Pastor I tried this
[1:41:43] I tried that but this one need
[1:41:50] you the pastor is not going even to pray
[1:41:54] he will just say thank you for letting
[1:41:56] me go home your problem is
[1:42:02] solv hey even if you can
[1:42:06] fast 40 days and 40 nights that problem
[1:42:10] will not leave you until you see
[1:42:15] your now the king said to them here is
[1:42:19] the dream I like Daniel he was just
[1:42:22] there holding
[1:42:24] arms looking looking down you know he
[1:42:27] was a shy
[1:42:29] person looking down
[1:42:32] with yeah what can I say
[1:42:37] yeah which
[1:42:39] is now he turn to speak L
[1:42:45] yeah yeah so at the end Daniel said no
[1:42:51] King because they failed
[1:42:54] God give me the
[1:42:55] interpretation here is the
[1:42:57] interpretation we can read verse 37
[1:43:02] verse 37 to 44 to 44
[1:43:08] amen thou oh King are a king of kings
[1:43:12] for the god of Heaven hath given thee a
[1:43:14] kingdom power and strength and glory and
[1:43:18] where soever the children of men dwell
[1:43:22] the Beast of the field and the fs of the
[1:43:24] heaven hath he given into thine hand and
[1:43:28] hath made the ruler over them all thou
[1:43:32] art this head of
[1:43:34] gold and after there shall arise another
[1:43:37] kingdom inferior to thee and another
[1:43:40] third Kingdom of brass which shall bear
[1:43:43] rule over all the earth and the fourth
[1:43:47] Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as
[1:43:50] much as iron breth in peace
[1:43:53] and subdueth all things and as iron that
[1:43:57] breth all this shall it break in pieces
[1:44:01] and
[1:44:02] Bruce and whereas thou seest the feet
[1:44:06] and Toes part of Potter's clay and part
[1:44:10] of iron the kingdom shall be divided but
[1:44:13] there shall be in it of the strength of
[1:44:16] the iron for as much as thou soest the
[1:44:18] iron mixed with Merit L and as the toes
[1:44:23] of the feet were part of the iron and
[1:44:25] part of clay so the kingdom shall be
[1:44:27] partly strong and partly broken and
[1:44:30] where as thou soers iron mixed with
[1:44:33] mirl they shall mingle themselves with
[1:44:36] the seed of me but they shall not c one
[1:44:40] to another even as iron is not mixed
[1:44:43] with CLE and in the days of these Kings
[1:44:46] shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom
[1:44:50] which shall never be destroyed and the
[1:44:52] kingdom shall not be left to another
[1:44:54] people but it shall break in pieces and
[1:44:57] consume all these kingdoms and it shall
[1:45:00] stand forever can you read 45 45 for as
[1:45:04] much as thou sawest the stone was cut
[1:45:07] out of the mountain without hands and
[1:45:10] that it break in pieces the iron the
[1:45:13] brass the clay the silver and the gold
[1:45:16] the great God ha made known to the king
[1:45:19] what shall come to pass Hereafter and
[1:45:21] the dream is set
[1:45:23] and the interpretation thereof
[1:45:32] sure he was troubled by
[1:45:35] this he saw the
[1:45:38] beginning and the end of the world but
[1:45:43] it was not meant for
[1:45:45] him know but he needs a man of God to
[1:45:50] explain to him
[1:45:53] you know Jesus was teaching in
[1:45:55] Parables and leave the people to go but
[1:45:59] to the disciples he will give them
[1:46:04] interpretation amen amen
[1:46:07] soar when he died he died knowing that
[1:46:13] his kingdom is above all the kingdom the
[1:46:17] one will follow the other one and the
[1:46:21] other one and the last one but the last
[1:46:24] one will be the kingdom that will stay
[1:46:28] forever and
[1:46:30] ever he saw the city to
[1:46:33] come amen amen then

[1:47:04] heads yes and then they were happy
[1:47:08] because he he was just a king in
[1:47:12] Babylon he he thanked
[1:47:15] God by erecting the
[1:47:18] stage of
[1:47:21] Daniel then Daniel said no this is not

[1:56:40] David he was not going to be like
[1:56:44] Daniel he was going to say

[1:57:28] right because God will give you the
[1:57:33] guidance amen
[1:57:36] amen question and answers on the
[1:57:39] seals
[1:57:41] Nebuchadnezzar made that stage of a
[1:57:44] man
[1:57:46] okay uh I want it where it says okay yes
[1:57:50] here let me continue with it spirit that
[1:57:52] man
[1:57:54] had he had a revelation or he made an
[1:57:57] image but his
[1:58:01] Revelation was Daniel a religious man
[1:58:05] being
[1:58:06] woried because he named him
[1:58:13] Bel which was the name of his
[1:58:18] God that was Nebuchadnezzar
[1:58:22] after he realized that the
[1:58:25] intelligence of the intelligence of
[1:58:29] Babylon has failed but through the
[1:58:34] intelligency of God that was in Daniel
[1:58:39] Daniel should be above
[1:58:41] all you know this thing of honoring the
[1:58:44] people with
[1:58:46] statues started long time ago so he
[1:58:50] honored Daniel but making a stage after
[1:58:54] making a stage that stage was Daniel
[1:58:58] then he said to the people the only God
[1:59:02] that we can worship is God of
[1:59:07] Daniel amen amen now watch the the
[1:59:11] Gentile
[1:59:13] kingdom was issued in the days of babyon
[1:59:17] by King
[1:59:18] Nebuchadnezzar a gentile King
[1:59:22] the
[1:59:23] church and the
[1:59:26] state together by taking a holy
[1:59:32] image of a holy man and forcing
[1:59:37] worship to
[1:59:38] eat Gentile
[1:59:42] Kingdom ends in the
[1:59:44] feet on the handwriting on the
[1:59:48] wall by a political
[1:59:50] power that United Church and the state
[1:59:55] together to force the kissing
[1:59:58] image
[2:00:00] same image of a holy
[2:00:04] man amen amen then he he realized that
[2:00:10] this
[2:00:10] government is ruled by the
[2:00:15] intelligency the
[2:00:17] Chans the
[2:00:18] sorcerers the
[2:00:20] magics
[2:00:22] whiches those people they rule in
[2:00:27] Babylon and he realized that for him to
[2:00:31] continue
[2:00:33] with he will not make it he needed
[2:00:38] Daniel who God condescended upon
[2:00:41] him he put a a picture in the middle a
[2:00:46] statue in the
[2:00:47] middle for this people and Daniel's
[2:00:51] people
[2:00:53] come in common and worship the state of
[2:00:57] Daniel he bring the church and he bring
[2:01:01] the politics he bring the
[2:01:04] state
[2:01:06] together then the church become
[2:01:11] compromised if the
[2:01:13] church goes with the
[2:01:16] state it's a compromised Church
[2:01:25] amen amen now the kingdoms
[2:01:29] come it was
[2:01:31] Babylon at the end of
[2:01:34] Babylon here comes the m and the
[2:01:40] pous and then gree and then Rome when
[2:01:45] you look at the picture you will see
[2:01:48] that at the end is
[2:01:52] iron at the end and day on the
[2:01:57] TW is
[2:01:59] iron mixed with
[2:02:01] clay that Kingdom tells you that is
[2:02:07] compromised it doesn't have that power
[2:02:11] anymore but when you remove the
[2:02:14] clay the Ste is there the iron there
[2:02:19] let's go to go to the Book of Revelation
[2:02:23] will not read I'm just going to tell
[2:02:26] what the prophet
[2:02:27] say in Revelation
[2:02:30] 13:14 we
[2:02:32] learn that does the
[2:02:35] Beast spread his
[2:02:39] influence through the
[2:02:41] image amen amen the image which was
[2:02:45] built for
[2:02:46] him those images are not innocent
[2:02:53] they influence our
[2:02:56] lives the image that was
[2:02:59] made is a worldwide ecumenical
[2:03:04] council where all the organized churches
[2:03:07] will get
[2:03:08] together with the Roman Catholic they
[2:03:11] are doing it even
[2:03:13] now it is quite simple
[2:03:16] thing this
[2:03:18] Union will come in order to stop the
[2:03:23] power of
[2:03:24] Communism but since
[2:03:27] communism it's like
[2:03:29] Nebuchadnezzar has been raised up to
[2:03:32] bend the Flesh of the
[2:03:35] hot Rome will be overcome and
[2:03:42] destroyed amen amen during the time of
[2:03:46] Rome I I will start there going there
[2:03:50] during the time of Rome
[2:03:53] Rome had this thing called
[2:03:57] paganism the
[2:03:59] paganism is when they have you know
[2:04:01] those
[2:04:04] dictators their
[2:04:06] mandate was to kill you you know a
[2:04:11] dictator is someone who will kill when
[2:04:16] you do not agree with
[2:04:20] him when you do not agree with him he
[2:04:23] will kill you either physically or your
[2:04:28] reputation Romans EMP
[2:04:31] pars they were
[2:04:33] dictators and they were
[2:04:35] mandated to kill now they kill until
[2:04:40] they bese
[2:04:42] Jerusalem surrounded their
[2:04:45] walls when they surrounded their world
[2:04:48] during the time of Titus he killed all
[2:04:52] of them until even they say the way the
[2:04:56] blood was
[2:04:57] flowing was like a river
[2:05:01] flowing amen and then the whole world
[2:05:05] started to be scared of Rome that Rome
[2:05:10] can
[2:05:11] kill amen amen you know they used to
[2:05:15] call they call this man Nero Nero when
[2:05:19] they talk about him they say he was a
[2:05:22] cruel
[2:05:24] man amen amen now we've got the people
[2:05:28] called
[2:05:31] Strat here comes the one by the name of
[2:05:36] Constantine constant time realize that
[2:05:41] this thing of killing is not going to
[2:05:44] work we need to do something he came
[2:05:47] with a
[2:05:48] strategy he come with a strategy
[2:05:52] he was in the
[2:05:53] government when he was there conversing
[2:05:57] for the
[2:05:59] elections he went to the Christian to
[2:06:02] pray for him so that he can win the
[2:06:06] election when he won the election he
[2:06:10] will be able to protect them now the
[2:06:14] Christian you know prayed for him he won
[2:06:19] the election after winning the election
[2:06:23] when he's in church he compromised the
[2:06:26] government he compromised the
[2:06:30] Christian for he brought them
[2:06:33] together amen amen when you read the
[2:06:36] book of the church
[2:06:38] ages brother Bram says so constant time
[2:06:42] invited the nominal
[2:06:45] Christian the First Christian Church of
[2:06:49] Rome to help
[2:06:52] C the Christian behind him as they were
[2:06:55] very large
[2:06:57] body when he
[2:07:00] there he
[2:07:02] elected leaders among them that when you
[2:07:07] go to your churches you need to read
[2:07:10] this not from the Bible they took an
[2:07:13] abstract from the
[2:07:17] Bible make an hybrid out of it and give
[2:07:21] to the church and a church becomes a
[2:07:24] compromised
[2:07:29] Church the Church of God all along was
[2:07:34] baptizing in the name of the Lord
[2:07:37] Jesus but when Constantine come he said
[2:07:41] to them you must baptize in the name of
[2:07:46] the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[2:07:49] they are compromised
[2:07:51] because brother BR the other day he was
[2:07:55] praying for someone I think it's India
[2:07:59] over the table then he said in the name
[2:08:03] of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[2:08:07] the table stay there in the name of the
[2:08:10] Le of Sheron in the name of Jehovah all
[2:08:14] the names the table was still on suspend
[2:08:18] but when he said in the name of the Lord
[2:08:22] Jesus Christ the table fell out and
[2:08:26] broke
[2:08:27] into it tells you that the name Lord
[2:08:31] Jesus Christ
[2:08:36] power when you pray if you can say in
[2:08:41] the name of Jesus it's not enough if you
[2:08:45] can say in the name of the Lord is not
[2:08:49] enough if you can say say in the name of
[2:08:53] Jesus Christ it's not enough you must
[2:08:56] say in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:09:02] Christ the Bible says when you do things
[2:09:06] in your hands amen and even everything
[2:09:11] in your entire life do it in the name of
[2:09:14] the Lord Jesus
[2:09:15] Christ you will see the power of God now
[2:09:19] Constantine Conan compromise the
[2:09:22] Christian of the day and then that was
[2:09:25] the beginning of the CL that was mixed
[2:09:30] with from
[2:09:32] paganism
[2:09:34] papism amen amen you know
[2:09:38] papalism is when the government and the
[2:09:40] church
[2:09:42] became and they started there and then
[2:09:45] the Christian started to live the
[2:09:48] compromised life
[2:09:52] amen that is
[2:09:55] politic amen
[2:09:59] amen Julius will call

[2:14:33] the thing Daniel explained to him we
[2:14:37] have our Prophet
[2:14:39] brother brother Bram who lived in this
[2:14:43] age when God raised him he showed him
[2:14:48] the vision vision it's something that
[2:14:51] you
[2:14:52] see when everything is
[2:14:55] clear God just come down and show
[2:15:00] you amen amen now there were seven major
[2:15:04] Vision that
[2:15:06] the I'm not going to read all of them
[2:15:09] I'm just trying to pick this one I want
[2:15:12] to show you this brother said my my
[2:15:17] first
[2:15:18] Vision this was in June Sunday morning
[2:15:22] June
[2:15:24] 19
[2:15:27] 333 God open the door for brother
[2:15:31] BR and he saw Visions he said my first
[2:15:35] Vision was that
[2:15:38] M would
[2:15:42] invade
[2:15:44] would invade ethopia you see this thing
[2:15:48] hasn't happened but it's like going to
[2:15:52] happen all right and that Nation will
[2:15:56] fall at his
[2:15:59] steps that Vision surely did cause some
[2:16:08] reperations and some were very
[2:16:10] angry when I say it and will not believe
[2:16:16] it the the vision that happened in
[2:16:21] 1933 where things were
[2:16:24] smooth brother said I
[2:16:28] see from Italy invading Africa invading
[2:16:34] ethopia the people in the world said no
[2:16:38] this is a wrong Prophet this false
[2:16:41] prophet that is not true they started to
[2:16:45] hate him but God show him
[2:16:49] that but it happened that
[2:16:52] way he just woke
[2:16:55] in with his modern
[2:16:57] arms took over the native didn't have a
[2:17:03] chance but the vision also said mol
[2:17:09] would come to a horrible end with his
[2:17:13] own
[2:17:14] people turning on him that came to pass
[2:17:19] just exactly as it was
[2:17:21] [Music]
[2:17:22] they're
[2:17:23] historians if you read history or follow
[2:17:27] it we see this Vision exactly happened
[2:17:32] in
[2:17:33] 1935 brother BR saw it in
[2:17:37] 1933 in
[2:17:40] 1935
[2:17:43] invaded after killing the people there
[2:17:46] he think he is enjoying his glory
[2:17:51] condescended upon his own people and he
[2:17:55] said to them this man killed my people
[2:17:59] in Africa deal with
[2:18:03] him they killed him his own people after
[2:18:07] killing him they took his wife and his
[2:18:10] keys to
[2:18:15] jail you see brother Brenham the true
[2:18:18] prophet of God he saw it
[2:18:21] and tell to the people and the people
[2:18:24] started to hate him brothers sisters the
[2:18:28] world may hate
[2:18:30] you stay to the
[2:18:35] course if they hated brother BR they
[2:18:38] should hate you today don't be a man
[2:18:42] pleaser stand for what you belied
[2:18:45] in said to them I can't do nothing I'm
[2:18:50] just a ver
[2:18:51] if God show me something and said I must
[2:18:53] talk to the people so be
[2:19:01] it in
[2:19:03] 1933 the very same
[2:19:06] year so
[2:19:09] Hitler rise up as a dictator in
[2:19:14] Germany and take the nation into
[2:19:18] war and the people couldn't believe it
[2:19:22] then Hitler came
[2:19:24] to amen the whole of
[2:19:27] Germany then I read the story of
[2:19:30] Hitler then I realized that Hitler did
[2:19:35] not win the
[2:19:36] elections because the people loved him
[2:19:39] but the present prime
[2:19:41] minister and his death
[2:19:44] bed he asked his people his deputies
[2:19:49] that Germany should go somewhere I need
[2:19:53] someone who can take it
[2:19:55] somewhere where I want it be
[2:20:01] there then this one said yes I am I will
[2:20:05] take it then this prime minister said to
[2:20:08] him you have a heart of a
[2:20:12] chicken you won't make it Germany is
[2:20:15] powerful Germany is strong Germany
[2:20:18] conquer the world I someone then
[2:20:22] everybody was like then he said to them
[2:20:25] I will speak against my own
[2:20:27] way like did I speak against my own
[2:20:32] way Moses even if he was against
[2:20:36] Egypt Moses is the man then this man
[2:20:40] said to them the whole of Germany I see
[2:20:45] Hitler the opposition he will take
[2:20:48] Germany where Germany to
[2:20:52] be that's how he came into
[2:20:55] Power he killed 6 million Jews killed a
[2:20:58] lot of people in the Holocaust and you
[2:21:01] go and read that history that's what he
[2:21:03] did then how he
[2:21:06] died was a
[2:21:09] mystery brother Bram said it when Hitler
[2:21:13] died it will be a mystery the people
[2:21:17] will not
[2:21:18] know hey when you read the history one
[2:21:22] will say this one will say this one will
[2:21:24] say he shot himself one he said he drink
[2:21:27] a poison when he said shoot his wife
[2:21:30] shoot his himself when he said the
[2:21:33] Russians came there were a lot of things
[2:21:35] around him but brother Bram says the
[2:21:38] death of Hitler will be a mystery and it
[2:21:42] happened
[2:21:46] exactly amen amen he said the third one
[2:21:51] it was
[2:21:52] political I see three
[2:21:55] isms the fism the Nazism and the
[2:21:59] communism trying to get
[2:22:02] together I was reading the history as
[2:22:05] well you know
[2:22:07] Italy Germany and Russia they were
[2:22:11] trying to come together but they could
[2:22:14] not agree because at the end the prophet
[2:22:18] says they will never agree
[2:22:21] but
[2:22:22] communism will swallow them
[2:22:25] all you know the word of God must be
[2:22:29] fulfilled all those
[2:22:31] things they happened exactly in that
[2:22:34] way amen amen then he continues say the
[2:22:38] fourth one I saw a car without a
[2:22:42] steering wheel shaped like an egg in a
[2:22:46] free way the people even playing cards
[2:22:50] come
[2:22:51] on this is
[2:22:54] unbelievable in
[2:22:57] 19333 you see
[2:22:59] this you believe it today because you
[2:23:02] are in
[2:23:04] 2024 but even
[2:23:06] 1968 even in
[2:23:08] 1968 you wouldn't have believed it
[2:23:11] because when you sleep or maybe you
[2:23:13] close your eyes try to imagine a car
[2:23:17] without a driver it's impossible
[2:23:20] how many are there
[2:23:24] today that was a prophet that said in
[2:23:28] 1933 but is happening
[2:23:30] today even the cars we are driving today
[2:23:34] they speak to
[2:23:37] us when you are
[2:23:40] drunk says I'm not going
[2:23:44] anywhere you are so
[2:23:48] drunk then
[2:23:50] and then it will just park itself there
[2:23:55] it's your car if you are
[2:23:57] drunk
[2:24:04] want rest a coffee you are tired they
[2:24:09] talk to us that is how technology
[2:24:15] advanced amen amen the fifth
[2:24:19] one he said I see the moral of the
[2:24:24] women yeah this one let me know go
[2:24:31] deeper because it's like a life
[2:24:37] normal I was talking to
[2:24:43] someone way you are lying it becomes
[2:24:47] normal it becomes just normal
[2:24:51] language to you is just lies if you
[2:24:54] can't
[2:25:02] lie same tune
[2:25:06] today with
[2:25:09] women I don't know what if I can say
[2:25:11] this
[2:25:14] but they The Prostitute of the old days
[2:25:28] better than the Christians
[2:25:30] today you want communicate me for that I
[2:25:33] won't take it fair amen amen
[2:25:37] amen the sixth one
[2:25:43] amen they arose up in
[2:25:47] America the most beautiful
[2:25:51] the most beautiful but a cruel
[2:25:56] woman she held
[2:25:59] people in her complete
[2:26:02] power I believe that this was the rise
[2:26:05] of the Roman Catholic
[2:26:08] Church though I
[2:26:11] knew it could
[2:26:13] possibly be a vision of some woman
[2:26:17] rising in great power in
[2:26:21] due to a popular
[2:26:25] V by a
[2:26:27] woman amen amen so if a woman is
[2:26:33] conversing for
[2:26:36] presiden The Other Women will vote for
[2:26:38] him and then it happens with Kamala
[2:26:42] Harris when he became the Vice President
[2:26:46] of America and then the highest position
[2:26:51] after president is the vice president
[2:26:55] now the that woman in that
[2:26:58] position power I want to tell you this
[2:27:02] that the woman has power Obed was old
[2:27:07] and even forget some species but Kamal
[2:27:11] will be the one that was in
[2:27:16] church amen amen and then brother Bram
[2:27:19] says even the word of God says when the
[2:27:22] woman started to have a
[2:27:25] control that
[2:27:27] nation is
[2:27:31] doomed amen amen now that woman was in
[2:27:35] charge of
[2:27:37] America be in charge of
[2:27:39] America in charge of the world because
[2:27:43] America America is the super power
[2:27:47] Nation amen amen if America
[2:27:50] speaks the
[2:27:54] rest only
[2:28:01] receive but don't come close to me
[2:28:04] because I will deal with
[2:28:06] you and the American will
[2:28:09] say you
[2:28:14] but have you seen a
[2:28:16] coward I'll slap you
[2:28:23] but hold me other I
[2:28:27] you he knows that if he can
[2:28:31] go
[2:28:32] him but just to show him that I'm Not
[2:28:38] Afraid knowing that if he can go be
[2:28:43] disappointed so Russia will say to
[2:28:48] USA you can talk but don't come here you
[2:28:52] come here you will
[2:28:54] regret amen so those are the visions
[2:28:58] that brother they happened exactly if
[2:29:02] Cala as a woman was in charge the end of
[2:29:07] the
[2:29:08] world the end of
[2:29:10] everything amen am so it shows you that
[2:29:14] in a matter of time Rapture will take
[2:29:16] place the last Vision was when
[2:29:20] I had the most terrible
[2:29:23] explosion as I Look to as I look I saw
[2:29:28] nothing but the de the crat and the
[2:29:32] smoke all over the land of
[2:29:35] America amen that's what
[2:29:38] brother those seven Vision I want to say
[2:29:41] another Vision here was a b
[2:29:44] controversial as I
[2:29:47] was reading about it

[2:30:26] prophet because Billy died last year
