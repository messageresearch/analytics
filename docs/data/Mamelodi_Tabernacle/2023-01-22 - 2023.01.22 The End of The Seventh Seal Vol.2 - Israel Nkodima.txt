Title: The End of The Seventh Seal Vol.2
Text: The End of The Beginning

This message was preached by pastor Israel Nkodima on 22 January 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle  in South Africa

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the end of the seventh seal according to Revelation 5: 1 - 7.  “And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.
5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.”
6 And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it has been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth
7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne 

He further read the Spoken word titled “The Breach Between The Seven Church Ages And The Seven Seals” 
The Breach Between The Seven Church Ages And The Seven Seals 251 But now in this sevenfold Book of Seals, of redemption, that the Lamb took, within Himself, was the only One Who could do it. And He took It from the right hand of Him that sat upon the Throne, now, to claim His redemptive, to claim His rights. To claim, for me and you, what He redeemed us from, to, see, back to everything that Adam lost in the garden of Eden. He has redeemed us back to that.
252 Now with the Lamb, with the Book in His hands, we are ready to ask His grace and mercy upon us, to open the Seven-Seal Book to us, and let us look ...

that that day is coming when the bridegroom the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride will come together in a marriage in that great day we know Lord and you have already sent us the book father that we should follow the rules as the bride of Christ knowing that the husband is coming and he has already sent the books uh so we are so glad that even this morning we know who we are where we come from where we are going we know why we are here we know the message that is coming forth it will be coming from the bridegroom and we are so glad to accept from the bridegroom what he wants his bride to to be like thank you Lord because you are shaping the bride with your word for the wedding to come preparations have been made by the bridegroom himself amen so that that day when it comes for a

the reading of this way you are the one father who can explain the word to us amen as we pray in Jesus Christ name amen amen you may be seated God bless you and yeah I think we are all happy and spiritual mood you know I was I'm looking for what I had this morning off for speaking about the what do you you call that now this morning but I don't have it here but I will read from the book here I I want to start by reading to you this party um now there it is she scientifically let me start why it says talking about the life magazine packed a deducted cloud in the sky every live magazine is very uh it was packed not by any magazine but life is magazine that was that light in the sky is and a brother came here spoke about it but it seemed it didn't go well with some all right you know if somebody comes and say something maybe wait for an elder or the pastors to uh bring that thing okay the brother brought something about the cloud in the sky confused some people yeah all right but it didn't confuse me I'm confused even today I understand the brother and I know that thing will happen okay now the Life Magazine paint that part of that is uh closed in the sky girl a life magazines or look which one which was it look or Life Life Magazine look over our life all right now there it is scientifically prove that is the truth he is talking concern in that cloud so therefore we don't worry about whether it's truth or both scientifically and spiritually and what was said uh come to pass so the message of the Seven Seals in their closing that that's the message of the entire Bible the Seven Seals closes the New Testament amen no when the Seven Seals remember are revealed out it closes it's only a new testament okay and they sealed it up high sorry that's true now we know that that is by prophetic utterance even by a scientific End by the word okay amen is there somebody who has said what I have read here okay is there somebody who can keep what I have ready okay and there was the angels that sent back okay you're touching the Angels you know I was looking at this where he says the angels and they were coming eastwards because Where was the where was the Garden of Eden situated that's where God has put the men um now that's why when he saw these angels with the mystery they came Eastward because he should he should bring that message from the headquarters that's why even God before he could open the book he had to take his position on his or in his throne now talking from the throne the message is specially for the subjects you know yesterday as we were singing and dancing you could see some people living in from the neighborhood some drinking this each and everyone taking his own way all right amen now even today little hole for before the Lord can speak to his people he must oppositioned himself on his throne because his subjects but they will take nothing unless it is from the throne but now you hear many people talking around the world like this message everywhere you hear people singing but tomorrow you ask we are the message Believers I'm not saying anything against it but you listen to what I'm trying to say but the bride of Christ will never take any message from anywhere unless it is from the throne now it is if it is from a throne then it will be received by I the one that's on the throne I will say this scary yo the prophet of God says God has forwarded a throne into you if you are a predestinated seat then there's a throne in you because that that's how God's operated from Throne to Thrones and he has said also I was just reading that the throne or a throne can only be seen from the inside I mean and they saw that that's now let's go to this room now okay I was just looking at these things making ability and it won't take me a long time like yesterday so I've got several books here because now it's different versions and I'm still going to ask my brothers to sit together and put them in one version is but then for to save time I've heard them here but I marked them I will read them but we'll put them together don't worry um the mystery of redemption is sealed until this book could could all right the mystery from the back side I'm going to bring you that the mysteries from the back side this book could not be broken until the last Angel's message so we are looking at the the last message the last Angel's message then first we have Adam the book was in the hands of Adam the hand of Adam the scroll was there we knew it was there you know that's how it looked like in those days the Old Testament that's why they called it the role called the Lord Jesus when he opened that scroll the Bible says then he found a place and that place that's where it spoke of him and that's why if we roll up the Scrolls even today each and every one of us comes to a place that speaks of him because if you don't find it in the Scrolls amen amen each scripture you've you find the names of the people or your name now I'm trying to say okay if they pull up the scroll ever put two large Scrolls the Lord Jesus did in the temple the Bible says then he found a place amen amen you know brother ATC was it Mark 5 or somewhere there that scripture I think when he arrived there amen they gave him a scroll to reach then he stood up when he opened the scroll how will I scroll he found a place amen amen yeah if you can't find it I think in my Bible is it Mark 5 look look not much God bless you sir say it aloud amen look at chapter four Luke chapter 4 you are not Mark Luke 4 17. amen yes that's it Luke chapter 4 verse 17. and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiahs and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set the at Liberty them that are bruised okay amen you know now the prophet tells you in those days it was a scroll evenly scroll amen and later compacted put together we call it the Bible now as he rolled and rolled the scroll yeah found a place meaning a person who is reading uh this now called the Bible he is looking for his place that scroll was handed over to him and then it was his opportunity now too roll up the scroll but but the mystery of it it says he found a place amen amen you know that's why every time I I I I open the books like I've got you you will notice that what I have found here in the books every time a preacher would come to preach he'll come to preach after he has found I'm a because every sermon is a place founded so as for to put the people in their in the right place nothing can put you in your right position without if it is not the word amen John Johan when he unfolded the scroll he found himself there we credit your farm amen the The Voice God bless you the voice of the one crying in the wilderness okay now he didn't say John it says the voice of the one crying in the wilderness okay but John has founded that Johanna to be himself that's how we read the Bible we find our place and when I look I said this is me I'm walking now uh brother Brandon knew that he knew that he is the missing the seventh angel messenger and I can't dispute it because I have also found my place now my place and his place then he becomes a prophet to me amen amen because I have also found my place you know if there's a star and these little other stars they find their places around that stuff when it is called a cluster all right now as we are here we are at last time that's why we can't differ we can hate one another foreign and then look now what happens when does that star appeared unto them not not unto any other person even if they could say to somebody do you see that stuff that someone would say um amen amen don't think that that star was visible to everybody all right I mean just like the Revelation is only for if you've got the Revelation it's for you that's what God has done to you okay I think I'm introducing let me look at this now now you listen tillage the Seven Seals closes the new testamentally all right amen and now I come to this this scripture I wonder I do oh yeah Revelation chapter five chapter five you know you wonder why the Lord came to the Earth it is because the first son forfeited the book will uh and the Lord had to come now could replace Adam he had to come himself now you you'll see here in the books that this message is not just a thing of reading cry for whatever and running maybe with a code it is amen amen it's a supernatural nerve Okay so yeah cowboy I'll tell you something I can say to you and got away okay if you have hatred but I can't take that hatred away because you should be the word now if you are not that word I can't take it away from you I can just preach it but it will still remain there because it is not there's no place for the way the Lord Jesus told the disciples who rejected him foreign now let's read and see if his weight has a place in you there's so many preachings so many teachings to change but the word of God is its own place I'm a we are not here just because of our preaching it's a call amen a call is the way that is part of you that has been revealed to him let me read it let me read it the scripture again brother you have read it look at chapter four look for amen they offered him foreign then when he found then it says then he found a place amen in the mode meaning that God offered us this book it's a book of our places each and every one of us should find his or her place in this book amen amen and when it is read now the Lord Jesus open it and it pinpointed him exactly treat who he is that was himself in that book yeah when he opened there he is I think you understand I read okay the mystery of redemption we are going to Revelation chapter 5. he said on the throne and had a book book written within and on the back side like I'm sealed amen amen so now usually but it was in the right hand side you remember the first time when I uttered these words some people thought thought it to be political politically but I was talking about the right hand of God and that's why to my brethren in Swaziland I always say to them amen amen to somebody they just keep quiet in South Africa because they think I'm talking politics but I'm talking about the Bible a typical swazi is talking about the swazi thing are you talking about the right-handed people and I'm talking about I'm not talking about you're right I'm talking about you I mean that's why you know everything was coming down until it reached the right hand people after he died he sat on the right hand of the Majesty amen when we look at him we say he of the right hand ah man amen now it's not as well to amen amen amen all right again um there is this baby um I was listening to um yesterday saying something and then I wondered yeah how did this thing reveal itself to him all right I won't say what the words that he has uttered okay let me read let us start now and God I'm studying here and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice I need to open the book and to lose the seals right amen now remember we are open let's read the verse again first yes again so we can get it together and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne cabinets then he says God who is that absolutely the original holder of the book or a book of life he holds it we say God does when Adam forfeited it it went back to his original owner yeah belongs to him but you know he gave it to Adam when he forfeited and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne took written within and on the back side with Seven Seals on the back side now if we are going to talk about the back side we are going to read the things here [Music] now let us go backwards because you can't find it when unless you go backwards I have tried to read some things here where it is the unveiling of God well one feeling of God it speaks of um I don't have it here but it says the the seals they speak of what what that was on when they opened Rahul they speak of I don't know you still remember I have read it not once that the opening of the seals they speak of what that was is that right amen now so we are going backwards if you know last only I don't have one uh what you call if you pay power so so if the word says in the beginning was the word now you know you know God has got no beginning in the beginning now you've got to take it back the word was God are you are you are we together in the beginning there was the way the word was I'm moving backwards [Applause] [Music] the way it was with God thank you then I'm still going back is if you properly want to read to read it you you you find yourself going back let me repeat to you in the beginning God has got no beginning and I've got that book still here what is the book called it's minus minor age I will read it again anything that had a beginning has an end this is Page 211. now he's running that's why God has got no beginning otherwise would be heading for the end of things anything that had a beginning because anything that had a beginning is a creation okay amen that's why my body yes and end because it's a creation I mean it's aging what too far no matter you can draw your future and what you want to do in the future what what will make you me to say to you even they want to say it's a future Refuge but the word of God says eternal life I mean man speaks of few his or her future God speaks of the eternal life that's the difference like I believe as they always saying I don't know what tomorrow will bring but I know the one who holds tomorrow foreign because God speaks of eternity okay amen God will never promise you something for tomorrow no oh he is eternity when they were in Egypt and he promised them the Promised Land he was promising them a place where he would speak with them for the further [Music] something that will take them further amen all right amen you see that's why that's why that's why I can't be a witch because it is drawing me back to hell but Christianity is taking me through eternity in these days that we are living in and all that was predestinated to happen in this day happened have you seen them okay well I was looking chemical Village at a it was I won't say where but the police were threatening somebody with arrests for wearing a t-shirt I think at the back it says it said follow Jesus or Jesus loves you something come from Jesus something about Villages and uniformed highly trained policemen but the police they were men two of them they wanted to arrest that man because yes Jesus loves you in a great country because it is she was praying because she was staying standing closer to a place where they performed this abortions going on now this woman she's praying in their hearts pertaining to this abortion that building there is no I'm just praying in my heart no because I'm standing before this place where they perform abortion abortions now where I'm praying Within Myself come with us the police station have you ever seen such as right I mean they were trained to do that now the Lord said these things will come you will be arrested for praying why you are praying okay I read oh yeah and anything that had a beginning are you listening yes if you start building you know that it is the end is also a company the end goes with everything of this world I mean if okay a child is born today that body has an end are you afraid all right if a child is born I'm I'm saying okay that body merely words I'm a you know even in buying a clothing or you say clothes or what you can buy one because it has an end you must there must be a replacement now even our bodies we shall put on immortality is that right okay um yeah you know this thing is I'm reading anything that at the beginning amen amen have you got that amen I'm saying anything that had a beginning I mean because it has a beginning now since God has got no beginning that's why he is and he is eternal but he is with him subjects now subjects of Eternity meaning they have no starting point amen amen and they have no because if it has no beginning it is all right I mean now look some some people can read the Bible and even say Pastor pray for me I feel I've realized that I've got no love then you pray he or she can even wipe tears from my face so you go Lord give him love but while saying God give him love the Bible says amen okay amen now how does God give somebody love now he makes you laugh amen a given thing it can get old and so far amen but now God instead of giving you that love let us make you he made you you can thank him for that okay like yes I may worshiper I do not say I worshiping no I worship in christophy this Tabernacle shall not stand forever you understand foreign here's your eternal life all right if it says he gave us eternal life that means we are Eternal because he is eternal you know brother Brendan says men and God say it came from the same place amen and he says they are one that's one today we are still coming to that result about mediation we touch it but you'll still want wonder and eat when it says prayer he is no longer a mediator mediation in back there in the old testamental was through the foreign with me good sorry but I'm coming we will read it okay let me let us finish this one God was not created he was always God there's no place he was created and the only way that we can ever have eternal life is to be part of that creation which is a creation that was not created all right I don't know if the only way that we can only turn our lives are feeling you say if if you stop smoking oh there's many non-smokers some people since they were born they have never smoked no you can't tell me it's eternal life the Bible never said stop smoking and you'll go to heaven you should be part of eternal life [Music] and then it says the only way say you can ever have eternal life is to be part is that right now I mean that's the only way till I know to be party means because he is eternal he says because because I live he says because I live you shall literally usually yeah I mean do because I'm a son let's go back because I live you shall live Little P I mean and it says when he died he died with him when he resurrected we resurrected with him so he make sure that we are part of him in everything we are talking about the resurrected Jesus Christ all right amen I think I'm preaching the gospel no now let's read these things and close the the mystery of redemption is sealed that mystery was there in that scroll he knew it was there we knew that it was Redemption we believe it was Redemption now I saw a strong angel proclaiming with that is in the Bible there who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof hello and no one was found to be worthy and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne God who is that absolutely
