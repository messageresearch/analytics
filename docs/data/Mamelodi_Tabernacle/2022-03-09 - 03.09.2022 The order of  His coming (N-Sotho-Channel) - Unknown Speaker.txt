morning and look at the the gentle part of it amen [Music] my foreign invited keeping the fire burning there now people are saying a lot of things about this message is [Music] the seventh angel of the lord is a follower sometimes can say i've got the reason the reason i left the message he left us god bless where i'm looking for mount transfiguration transfiguration we are looking at the other office coming how he did you see my copy on the lighthouse because it's lighthouse house scriptures give but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god and it came to pass about an eight days after these things he took peter and john and james and went up into a mountain to pray and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his remnant was white as clester and behold there talked with him two men which were moses and elias who appeared in glory and speak of his disease which he should accomplish at jerusalem foreign [Music] heavenly father amen in jesus christ to me amen you may be seated okay let me read you this party he was transformed what did he do pass himself into transformation over into his coming days just a few hours before this because in the old testament everything little every word was established by three witnesses taking them up on the mountain notice what comes first right them moses and elijah before jesus witness of the last church age coming in power to manifest him amenity i mean [Music] jesus christ moses jesus christ and then firstly we have read this to show out the order of his coming elijah we have things here before the rapture there are things to follow [Music] those is original siege spoken word first of god says the bride has the word this morning immediately [Music] russia is coming you know about that book of mine because we believe we are we know we are beyond the churches jesus um uh as we are the bride of christ [Music] part is is going to get engaged this when you are talking about the battle of armageddon is was cast you are part of if they're not [Applause] what someone will be like or what but i know there is the last teaching [Applause] then we that are waiting for is coming [Music] because and they will see them even when the marriage shall take place the millennium now we find here that enoch was the seventh from nowhere her position and we take on until we come to this which was the type of the church ages [Music] before enoch died [Music] that that was uh first what comes first is the rapture in faith now the rapture in faith is not the day of the rapture of [Applause] is [Applause] we are in the seven churches we are talking about the seven churches you that's we that are still alive without them but they are dead they are in the sixth dimension page [Music] if god loves you but enoch raptured all the rest of them was a type of all of the rest of them dying dying oh no no okay i have not considered myself to be dying yes i'm waiting for the rapture to i can show you the reason i left the message because a christian don't do such things [Applause] so we don't wonder as they start going so now but the one is is waiting for to listen to the pastor and send out the weight they see you you don't need to wait for the reasons because the reason is that she wanted to wear like that she wanted to do that [Music] is is [Music] [Applause] amen they don't have to die first in order to be raptured they will be raptured without death yes i will quote it to you if i don't have it here do you have it brother revelation chapter four first one after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up heather and i will show the things which must be here aft home [Music] 155 all right are you there okay brother i'm trying to one 155 155 oh oh oh all right god bless you god bless you now that's

the church ages but lifted [Music] come up here and they so there's no other faculty to catch that message the bride will be called out of the called out of bhagavati [Music] and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things said the ammon the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither called nor hot i hold thou went cold or hot so then because thou art look warm and neither cold nor hot i will spill thee out of my mouth because thou saith i am rich and increase in goods and have need of nothing and knows not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i can't sell thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire okay my brother that is the condition of the church now let's leave in church behold i stand at the door and knock right now he has left now the church is lukewarm amen [Music] we are the manuals [Music] that's why you are involved in money rituals they are in their churches rituals [Music] and he knows what the people want a young girl told me that in heaven [Music] those who wanted to be rich foreign [Music] [Applause] money shall pass away amen amen shall pass away christ i
