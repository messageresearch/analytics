The Pastor read the following scriptures: 
Revelation 3:20-22,  2 Thessalonians‬ ‭2‬:‭1‬-‭7 ‭and 1st John 3:2

The secret of the Sixth Seal is the Prophet.

and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will serve with him and he with me to him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne even is as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches amen amen amen um [Music] amen uh I'm trying to read I used something before we take our city in this book yeah uh the spoken word is the original seat the spoken word is the original page one one two one one two one twelve amen uh paragraph 420 a paragraph 420 and uh I'll take this part here here is the secretary uliano she has then it is dramatized so the Holy Spirit Waters it is [Music] they don't only do they they do only his will I didn't fail Ure no one can persuade them differently [Music] or they keep still meaning even the ministry they have what the Lord says you may take your seats all right we will continue there with that paper the third through yeah this is the third Throne Ministry okay actually how about you it's not preaching to the people who knows last we were looking at something here I will not be preaching to the people because we are looking at the the seals are being opened and everything is in his place amen I'm going to start with this foreign I've been reading it for you know for ages I just wonder if it has found a place in somebody else um now the prophet uh puts this to us and about I'm still just putting things together and they wait Linda in the bread yeah now you realize it seems like we've been bringing things in pieces touch there and leave amen amen while we were last time we were looking at the evidence so the first one I think you have noticed you have seen these things we were looking at Abraham when he looked from the place he saw Sodom burning ah bonuses and then we came to build a brand name at the the seventh sign he also saw a similar things and then as I said last time I was also trying to get into a tribulation tribulation tribulation but I couldn't because we are waiting for a takeoff here I teaching trying to teach well you you'll see where we are and uh so we can't get into some other things it's the time of the tribulation we are just waiting but it's like that so but that's why I read this is will be looking at that yes said through the ministry is there now not preaching to the people no yeah it's over but it is just in their heart you know my fella mobile amen of those that are to be raptured usually I will read some I've got something here okay I'm going to remind you of something because according to this church ages Christ is outside if you read everyone that is standing in because the prophet says what happened he is not in he is not in the church he's outside okay but knocking at individuals we are individuals and you don't know who's who here but we are individuals there's some people that are living they will be taken up in the river [Applause] party did you know that they know but it's already potentially it is I wonder if you you've known it yeah [Applause] that's why we you will realize we are not free last week is somebody yeah and even some I don't know who's this young man who brought their cell phones gave them to brother to barbella yeah amen amen and then she's not the only person with their cell phones there's some people here with cell phones and they've got things right they are not ready for the Rapture anything I'm talking about the bride of Christ the bride of Christ the people who are ready a mysterious part of it is is that potential the Rapture is in them I'm sorry I'm talking to the people who uh who are ready to be taken up already in them okay amen now we will reach you things and I won't prolonged things and now another thing maybe you'll wonder at this seems that we are taking things in pieces like I had another page last characters and that we it speaks of also the seventh yeah this one yes speaks of the men of sin all right hey he says hey I love I I love the the man of God does this mean of sins that is second Thessalonians chapter four I think chapter 2 chapter 2 it speaks of this man of sinbi who will be revealed in his time at the breaking of that scene okay amen and I want to foreign opened to us now if I ask you what is open to us you see but I will reach and now you know what withholded that he might be revealed in his time because that time is already arrived for the men of sin to be revealed but it says in his Monaco in his time at the breaking of that so you know the breaking of that scene I read out of the book here let me read you something yeah where where we are more brilliant okay amen um like last week it's not a a thing of calling the people and say I said Surrender Your cell phone surrendered it's already in their heart amen he who's keeping his he's keeping it in his house you will listen to something the first word was that uh and so in his time let me look in his time at the breaking of that Layla now that we have six seal here and uh you know why brother Larry memes here say yes the silence Christ Jesus magnetic pool and the full operations that means you are caught up yeah not not prayer life then it says the opening of the servants yeah of which the people are still saying it is but it says to the public because if we were to go back yeah now the threefold mystery yes if you are part of that if it it is opened if we were to rewind rewind to the Third that's it Mysteries what is what is threefold nah threefold spirit okay Jesus let that amen yeah I mean at that day you shall know that I'm in the father that I am foreign you see it's so easy to miss these things water three food he says or at that day and then he says that's this day but you see you have lost it already that day this day you shall know I am nothing [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] so the opening of the series it's one thing okay I I I I believe you understand I'm looking at this you see uh what a statement let us read that scripture yeah second Thessalonians chapter 2 from verse 1 to 7. now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him uh Gathering Together and to him amen okay God bless you that he be not soon shaken in mind or be traveled neither by Spirit nor by way nor by letter is from us as that day of the of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first amen all right um have you do you understand me they're falling amen amen falling away in so much you won't even try to preach to the people falling away you know after they're falling away of Lucifer these agents call him father but the Asian tried to meet your dad okay amen did you see God coming to him trying to preach to him this Falling Away it's not like somebody as we were born in sins be that's why God knew that you are redeemable amen foreign many kissing okay I mean we attracted that um you know the Lord Jesus said to their Pharisees no no please it comes but it's fine it finds no yes hello let's look at this because you know the soul is the place of the word when the word comes hello Angelica it doesn't come to your head a little motor on your heart because you'll dilute it it comes to your heart I'm not below now in the heart of men there is what we call the soul once the weight of God comes to a man it comes later not to the heart of flesh but through their soul all right we'll look at that but I'm still looking at this this man of sin foreign because the breaking of that scene we have the breaking of the sixth seals tell me Butch what do you see when the six seal is open Hello fate okay amen the the prophets the prophet and then they opened the sixes now if you don't see the 60s you can't see the 17. because for the Seven Seas you go to to the book of the Rapture yeah no no and give me
