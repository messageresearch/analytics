[0:09] [Music]
[0:15] [Music]
[0:23] [Music]
[0:30] Amen. And you know if you have a son and
[0:34] you are a father
[0:36] and your son resembles you.
[0:41] Amen. And when he walks there
[0:45] you look at him because the people say
[0:49] hey you know he's just like his father.
[0:52] Amen. You you'll keep your eye on that
[0:56] boy.
[1:00] Am I like this?
[1:03] Amen. Amen. So now if he's doing fine,
[1:08] he's doing
[1:10] it will please you to know that
[1:14] he is my image.
[1:19] Amen. Now you can say if you see me you
[1:23] see
[1:27] you see him you see me.
[1:31] Amen.
[1:33] And if you can have something that
[1:36] resembles you
[1:39] [Music]
[1:40] in all quarters.
[1:43] Amen. Won't it make you happy?
[1:50] That's right. So God wanted something
[1:52] that could look like him.
[1:59] So he said let us make men in our image.
[2:04] Now the Bible tells me
[2:07] now this man
[2:10] and uh as you know Adam
[2:14] he had all the the the features of God.
[2:20] I can I can tell you something. Maybe
[2:21] you'll believe it.
[2:24] Adam was a young man. Amen.
[2:29] Amen. And after the fall,
[2:33] God himself,
[2:35] no one could replace Adam.
[2:40] He was a product from God.
[2:44] He was not born.
[2:47] Amen. So, and after the fall,
[2:52] uh God looked looked for his image.
[2:57] You know how he cried out, "Adam, where
[2:59] are you?"
[3:01] Because the image shifted
[3:07] after they sin,
[3:10] they started to run.
[3:14] It's still happening even today.
[3:17] People are running away from God
[3:21] because they are not right in their
[3:22] life. anger. Amen. They are still
[3:27] running away.
[3:30] Then God started again.
[3:34] Now when the Lord Jesus came,
[3:39] he I will say again, he died a young man
[3:45] because the Bible says he's the second
[3:48] Adam.
[3:51] Now, if Adam was a young man,
[3:54] that's why we couldn't have an old
[3:57] Jesus.
[4:01] Amen. Or maybe somebody's listening.
[4:05] Adam was a young man.
[4:08] The second Adam was a young man.
[4:14] Only after they had sinned,
[4:19] then they started to age
[4:24] in the second covenant.
[4:27] So now the Lord Jesus Christ
[4:31] was cut off
[4:34] when he was
[4:37] 30
[4:38] years. A young man.
[4:41] Amen. Amen. He couldn't age
[4:45] because it would not detail
[4:48] with the system
[4:52] in the first covenant.
[4:54] So he was supposed to be cut off
[4:58] a young man,
[5:00] the second Adam.
[5:03] Amen. Amen. So now
[5:07] Adam left his position.
[5:13] and God could not again fellowship
[5:20] Adam cut off the lifeline.
[5:26] Amen. You know today we have a a natural
[5:30] system
[5:31] introduced.
[5:33] We have cell phones.
[5:37] With cell phone,
[5:40] it matters not where you are.
[5:45] As long as you are within the range of
[5:47] the um
[5:50] uh system,
[5:54] they say you are connected.
[5:58] I mean there you you walk around, you'll
[6:00] see what do you call them? transmitters
[6:06] upon the mountains
[6:08] upon the mountains.
[6:12] That's that's the prophets. Amen.
[6:17] You know, God had put some prophets
[6:21] and Moses always used to go up to the
[6:25] mountain
[6:28] as a transmitter.
[6:31] The people wanted to uh speak to God.
[6:36] Moses was the transmitter there
[6:40] so that uh the people could be able to
[6:44] connect.
[6:47] Even today we have a transmitter,
[6:52] the seventh angel messenger. Amen.
[6:56] Our transmitter.
[6:59] Amen. And so God does things like that,
[7:04] natural things, type spiritual things.
[7:10] Moses, he stood up there like a
[7:13] transmitter
[7:15] in that position
[7:18] and there sometimes when the people
[7:23] cut off the line.
[7:27] Amen. Amen. And like
[7:32] maybe I can say again
[7:35] almost all of you
[7:38] all have some cell phones
[7:42] but you have you have air time.
[7:48] Amen.
[7:50] every time
[7:53] because as a pastor you know people
[7:56] phone me tell me
[8:00] but almost every time
[8:03] somebody phones
[8:05] hello hello pastor can you you speak
[8:08] quick quickly
[8:11] amen
[8:13] he only puts three rand time
[8:17] now he wants you to speak quickly
[8:25] You see, so now
[8:28] I mean sales phone was not meant for
[8:31] this.
[8:34] So almost all all of you here
[8:38] you in position of uh cell phones but
[8:42] not air time.
[8:45] If we can cast some votes here only
[8:48] few with air time.
[8:51] Amen. Now you you find many people in
[8:54] the churches this morning
[8:58] but without spirit time.
[9:03] Amen.
[9:05] They won't connect.
[9:10] They always tell God,
[9:13] "Please call me."
[9:18] Amen.
[9:22] Right now, let's turn to this.
[9:25] Amen. My my my h my uh what's the name?
[9:30] Granddaughter.
[9:33] Always she picks up my cell and say,
[9:41] Call me. Many call me. Please call me.
[9:44] Please call me. Please call me. Please
[9:46] call me. Amen. Amen. And I'll always say
[9:52] no. Let's wait until they call me.
[9:57] Amen. This what happened in the garden
[10:00] of Ed.
[10:03] Adam was now running away
[10:06] and he sent God please call me please
[10:10] call me. So Adam
[10:13] he had no
[10:16] no air time.
[10:19] You get what I what I mean now let's
[10:22] look at this
[10:24] position
[10:26] is very very important.
[10:30] H Christianity is a position.
[10:35] You change from something to something
[10:42] and you know if you can offer somebody
[10:47] let's say I learned somebody
[10:51] and you say I I want you to
[10:54] uh manage this place.
[10:58] I've got an office for you
[11:02] computer and all things
[11:05] and the person is not learned
[11:09] you know you'll put a fright in him.
[11:14] Amen. Amen. So now he must qualify
[11:19] for for that position.
[11:23] Then you'll find somebody coming with a
[11:25] diploma
[11:28] looking for a a job. He qualifies.
[11:33] You just put him in an office
[11:36] with the computer and all those things.
[11:39] He straight away he'll start to connect
[11:42] and
[11:45] that is he's qualified for that.
[11:49] Amen. Now he will fit in
[11:53] in that position
[11:55] because he was trained for that
[11:57] position.
[12:00] Amen. Now that's why now
[12:04] in our day
[12:07] where the problem is
[12:09] is that God
[12:12] uh has put forward
[12:17] to us
[12:19] like you read in the papers
[12:22] they tell you jobs jobs.
[12:26] Yeah. They want a driver with five years
[12:29] experience.
[12:32] Yeah, they want a manager. Yeah, they
[12:34] want a personel. All those things.
[12:38] Amen. But there's somebody who can't
[12:40] even read those things.
[12:44] Maybe he can read Job because Job is
[12:47] common, you know.
[12:51] Then after seeing Job, he will try maybe
[12:54] to look at this.
[12:57] He doesn't understand what a person a
[12:59] person
[13:02] you know you find things like that.
[13:05] And now you come to the spiritual
[13:08] things.
[13:10] You'll see these things.
[13:13] I'll read it for you.
[13:16] So there's some uh advertisements
[13:22] but you need to qualify.
[13:27] Amen. Now if I I don't qualify.
[13:32] I have not done a computer.
[13:35] I won't bother myself.
[13:38] If there's line up of computer jobs
[13:40] there,
[13:43] I just look at them and say,
[13:48] "I'll turn to something else because I
[13:50] don't qualify here."
[13:54] Amen. You put to a man,
[13:58] then he
[14:00] Jesus saves.
[14:04] This one speaks of Jesus.
[14:08] you you know things like that because he
[14:11] doesn't qualify you
[14:16] things like that now that's why now
[14:20] position
[14:22] is very important in
[14:26] as I say everything is strong in its
[14:30] position
[14:34] uh I was reading even the other
[14:38] They're talking about the bears
[14:41] and they talking about the Milky Way up
[14:45] there,
[14:47] you know,
[14:49] of stars and stars and stars.
[14:55] And uh now they say
[14:58] these birds for migration
[15:03] they use the Milky Way.
[15:08] That's the position. Their position.
[15:11] You can try to do that. You'll fail.
[15:17] That's their position.
[15:19] God's given position.
[15:23] How they do it?
[15:26] I understand they also have a prophet.
[15:32] When they start to fly to migrate
[15:36] The the prophet goes up
[15:40] with his
[15:42] um uh uh compass.
[15:47] Then he will look this side, look that
[15:48] way, look that way.
[15:51] Then he will start to fly.
[15:55] Amen. And uh the rest the subject.
[16:01] So they some of them from Europe to
[16:04] South Africa
[16:09] certain season
[16:11] they come here but they say they use the
[16:15] universe
[16:18] to to find their location
[16:22] to locate the place.
[16:25] Have you ever seen a lost bed?
[16:29] No.
[16:31] All right. Now we'll read. I I have a
[16:35] dog at home.
[16:38] If you can open your gate by mistake,
[16:42] [Music]
[16:43] it will dash out,
[16:46] gone,
[16:48] the whole day.
[16:50] I know of I had two of them.
[16:54] They vanish sometimes before I
[16:56] experienced this.
[17:00] and I thought they were gone
[17:04] late in the afternoon.
[17:06] Yeah, they are coming tired.
[17:11] Amen. Amen. Now, one man who experienced
[17:17] these things. He said to me, you know
[17:20] what, brother?
[17:22] Uh these things you can as long as you
[17:26] drive your car to and fro to and fro
[17:33] you will leave something for them.
[17:37] What is that? Once you you take your
[17:40] dog,
[17:42] he says you can you can go far with this
[17:46] dog
[17:48] in your car and leave it there.
[17:51] and drive back.
[17:54] That dog will find its way back.
[18:00] How?
[18:03] It can smell.
[18:08] That's right. Like for it to know you
[18:10] and accept you in
[18:13] it will start by
[18:15] it will smell and smell and smell. Next
[18:18] time you come,
[18:21] that's right. It will accept you. It
[18:25] knows you.
[18:28] Okay. It can use eyes, nose, and all
[18:32] those things.
[18:34] Now I can try to do that. I will feel.
[18:39] [Music]
[18:40] But I take it far.
[18:43] It will take that sand.
[18:46] I leave it there. I go home
[18:49] then it will come follow the sand.
[18:54] It's a unique position.
[18:57] Now you find a child of God.
[19:01] You can leave him where
[19:04] the prophet says you can dig six feet
[19:08] down
[19:11] and put his body there. He will still
[19:14] come and pick up that body,
[19:18] very unique.
[19:22] On the day of the resurrection,
[19:25] the spirit is released.
[19:28] The spirit picks the soul
[19:31] and he will pick up that body
[19:35] again. That's why the Bible says the the
[19:38] the graves were open.
[19:41] Only bones in there. There were bones in
[19:44] there. Amen. But those spirits,
[19:48] they picked up the soul. They came back
[19:51] again.
[19:52] And they revived the whole body.
[19:58] Amen. It's unique how God
[20:04] and now if somebody
[20:07] was in heaven
[20:09] with God,
[20:12] you can leave him
[20:14] in a bar
[20:16] or somewhere else.
[20:19] There will be a time
[20:22] when he will start moving back again.
[20:27] he will start to leave those things.
[20:31] Amen.
[20:33] And I said to a brother,
[20:36] he h after he had um together with some
[20:42] of the brethren,
[20:44] he broke away from the church.
[20:48] So I said to him, when we met at the
[20:51] funeral,
[20:54] I said, "Where are those children?
[20:58] you deceived
[21:00] says uh no you know pastor
[21:04] you know I think one one day we'll meet
[21:06] and so I said oh no now let me tell you
[21:09] something
[21:10] you know an eagle
[21:13] said yeah I said you can steal the the
[21:17] the young ones
[21:20] and take you far away take them far away
[21:24] amen now Remember while they are there
[21:29] they are growing.
[21:32] Amen. Amen. The Bible says when when
[21:34] Moses come to age
[21:38] he forsook Egypt.
[21:42] He started to pick up the Jewish scent.
[21:48] Amen. He started to pick up the Hebrew
[21:51] scent
[21:54] and he started to move.
[21:58] Amen. Amen. So he could have been a rich
[22:01] man in Egypt,
[22:05] richest.
[22:08] Amen. He had everything there.
[22:12] A son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[22:16] But when that time arrived,
[22:20] he looked around.
[22:22] Amen. Amen. And he had another sense.
[22:28] And the Bible says he saw the invisible
[22:31] one.
[22:34] He saw the promised land.
[22:37] He saw the children of Israel
[22:40] as the people of the promise.
[22:44] Amen. He saw Egypt as a dying nation.
[22:49] So he started to move around
[22:52] and he started to go.
[22:56] He picked up a Jewish scent.
[23:01] Then he said, "I'm not an Egyptian."
[23:05] Amen. I belong to another race.
[23:11] I'm a child of the promised people.
[23:15] So he started to take off
[23:18] the Egyptian attire
[23:22] seeing the invisible one
[23:25] and he started to move.
[23:28] A Christian is a person on the move.
[23:34] Amen.
[23:36] No time for drugs and all those things.
[23:39] He's a person on the move.
[23:44] Amen. Amen.
[23:47] Isn't he wonderful?
[23:50] So that that that was Moses
[23:55] and it cost him some things
[23:59] cost him some things.
[24:03] That was his position.
[24:06] So I said to this brother, one day
[24:11] these eagles,
[24:12] these eaglers,
[24:15] they will grow
[24:17] and the instinct in them
[24:21] will start to look for the original
[24:23] places.
[24:26] They will start to look for their
[24:28] parents
[24:30] and you will never see them again.
[24:35] They will leave you.
[24:38] And uh after some months,
[24:42] it happened.
[24:44] Amen. The people he drew away,
[24:48] they started to move back.
[24:52] It's just like that.
[24:55] from heaven.
[24:58] The people here on earth
[25:00] after the fall of our parents there.
[25:04] The people here
[25:07] they started to move back again
[25:11] as so generous and pilgrims and so
[25:13] forth. Abraham started there looking for
[25:16] a city.
[25:20] Amen. Amen. And on his pilgrimage
[25:25] he met Mechisedc
[25:28] the king of that city to come
[25:31] the king of Berland.
[25:35] So he met him. Now that's why the
[25:37] prophet says if your ministry
[25:41] don't come to a supernatural point
[25:46] with that ministry.
[25:49] The ministry must bring to a
[25:51] supernatural
[25:56] right now. Let's look at this. Now, the
[25:59] Bible says, "A true worshipper
[26:03] shall worship the father."
[26:06] I want to read this scripture.
[26:09] H this is thing started somewhere in
[26:12] Switzerland.
[26:14] When I looked at this thing,
[26:17] he said,
[26:20] The woman said, "Our fathers worship in
[26:23] this mountain."
[26:26] And you say that in Jerusalem is the
[26:28] place where men ought to worship.
[26:33] Jesus said unto her, "Woman,
[26:38] believe me, the hour cometh,
[26:41] when ye shall neither in this mountain,
[26:44] nor yet at Jerusalem worship the the
[26:46] Father,
[26:50] Now notice this thing. Worship the
[26:52] father.
[26:57] Amen. Amen. Ye worship you not not what
[27:00] we know what we worship for salvation is
[27:03] of the Jews.
[27:09] Amen. But the hour cometh.
[27:15] As long as salvation is of the Jews only
[27:22] can worship God don't hear him
[27:27] because in those days salvation was of
[27:31] the
[27:34] Amen. Amen. Now under in our day
[27:41] all right
[27:43] salvation
[27:45] is for a certain class
[27:51] God is is responsible for that.
[27:56] Amen. Why people can cannot believe the
[28:00] same thing.
[28:06] Jesus came. He made miracles.
[28:09] He made this and that enough to convince
[28:13] a a human being.
[28:16] But some were not converted.
[28:20] They just refused him and called him
[28:22] names.
[28:24] But others
[28:26] worshiped him.
[28:30] Amen. What is this? Salvation was for
[28:34] this and not for this.
[28:41] All right. Amen. So you put all things I
[28:45] if I can throw you into the water,
[28:49] you won't survive there.
[28:53] If I put you into the water
[28:56] and I take a fish out of the water,
[28:59] the fish won't I'll survive. Yeah.
[29:03] you won't survive.
[29:07] The water is for the fish.
[29:12] Amen. Amen. Amen. So that's where it is
[29:16] converted. Amen.
[29:20] Its position is in the water.
[29:24] Now it's not for you. It's for the fish.
[29:30] Amen. Amen. Once you talk about water,
[29:33] the fish would be jumping. Hallelujah.
[29:38] Hallelujah.
[29:42] Now salvation
[29:44] was for a special type of people for
[29:47] other. But the Lord said now we are
[29:50] going to introduce salvation
[29:54] to the Samaritans as well
[29:58] to the other nations.
[30:00] But right now it's only for the Jews.
[30:05] So a Samaritan would come
[30:08] and there will be an excuse. Oh, sorry.
[30:10] It's just for the Jews.
[30:16] Amen.
[30:18] And then but the hour cometh
[30:21] and now is
[30:24] when the true worshippers.
[30:28] Now there's worshippers and true
[30:29] worshippers.
[30:32] [Applause]
[30:34] True worshippers
[30:36] shall worship the father.
[30:42] Now that time is now
[30:46] is coming.
[30:48] Now let's go back again
[30:51] because the Jews
[30:53] in those days they worshiped the father.
[30:58] Now he say and the the time is now
[31:02] but the time is
[31:04] coming.
[31:07] All right. Amen.
[31:09] The time that time is now
[31:13] because Peter and Philip and
[31:16] Philip was there at that time before uh
[31:22] he died on rose again. They worshiped
[31:25] the father there.
[31:28] That's what they knew.
[31:31] Now the lord says the time is now
[31:35] and the time is coming.
[31:41] That is our time here.
[31:44] Time is coming.
[31:49] Amen.
[31:50] Now he said
[31:53] you you worship and but the hour cometh
[31:58] and now is
[32:01] two.
[32:02] One is coming,
[32:05] one is now.
[32:08] When the true worshippers
[32:11] shall worship the father
[32:14] in spirit
[32:17] and in truth.
[32:19] For the father seeketh such to worship
[32:21] him.
[32:24] So he puts the pattern. He puts the
[32:26] standard.
[32:28] Those who will worship me.
[32:32] They will worship me in spirit.
[32:35] And that is his own spirit.
[32:39] That means he will give them that
[32:41] spirit.
[32:47] Amen. Amen. For the father
[32:50] seeketh such
[32:53] to worship him.
[32:58] That means if the others worship
[33:01] the father won't even listen
[33:05] because the the true worshippers
[33:09] worship in
[33:12] spirit because God is a
[33:16] spirit.
[33:18] God is a spirit and they that worship
[33:23] must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[33:31] And the woman said, "I know that Messiah
[33:35] cometh."
[33:37] She had started to to to sense
[33:43] and to send something.
[33:46] I know that Messiah cometh
[33:49] who is called the the Christ. When he is
[33:52] come, he will tell us all things.
[33:57] And now I I perceive now.
[34:00] Amen. Amen. Okay. Now
[34:04] the thing is now let's read this and
[34:07] close.
[34:12] Page 22.
[34:16] I'll I'll try this book here page 22
[34:20] that is um this book here.
[34:27] Uh Christ
[34:31] is revealed in his
[34:36] No, no, no. Mighty God.
[34:43] Uh, I hope I've got the thing here
[34:47] because it is in some pages.
[34:51] Uh, page I want to read page 22.2.
[34:55] Uh, just hold on with me. Hold on for
[34:58] me.
[35:00] I'll read you that thing. Now, while
[35:02] while I'm looking for this, if you not,
[35:05] I will just quote to you. The prophet
[35:08] says here,
[35:10] Oh, yeah. Yeah. The Bible says, "Seek
[35:12] and you shall find."
[35:15] Page 22, I'll read you this part.
[35:20] Now, uh he said
[35:24] uh uh uh you know uh that book Luke uh
[35:28] 17:30.
[35:31] So shall it be when the son of man
[35:36] now not the son of God.
[35:41] The son of God is some is is another
[35:45] position
[35:47] and the son of God
[35:50] is another position
[35:53] of the same person.
[35:56] Amen. Now let's see now. Now the
[35:59] position
[36:00] of a true worshipper.
[36:04] He he or she's in a position
[36:08] to identify
[36:12] Amen. You know if you don't know a
[36:15] computer
[36:18] and you look at a person
[36:20] operating a computer there, you are just
[36:23] looking. You don't know what he's doing.
[36:28] Amen.
[36:32] So he knows what he's doing.
[36:35] But you I don't know a thing. just be
[36:39] looking at him.
[36:42] You get what I mean? So, but he he is in
[36:46] that position.
[36:50] Now, let's close with this. Listen to
[36:51] this.
[36:55] The true worshippers shall worship the
[36:57] father.
[36:59] Now, there's a time when they worshiped
[37:02] the father.
[37:08] That's why now if you turn to Peter
[37:10] here,
[37:13] Peter says,
[37:15] the Lord says, who do men say that I,
[37:18] the son of man am?
[37:21] Now listen carefully,
[37:23] who do men say,
[37:26] I the son of man,
[37:29] not the son of God. people. I the son of
[37:33] man.
[37:35] Son of man means prophet.
[37:39] Who do men say I the son of man am?
[37:43] And they said you are that. You are
[37:45] that. You are that. And and he said who
[37:48] do you?
[37:50] Now that was to the prophetic class.
[37:55] Who do you say
[37:58] that I the son of man
[38:02] am? Amen. Now I want you to note he
[38:04] never said son of god
[38:07] son of man.
[38:10] He meant who do you say I the prophet
[38:17] that was son of man. The prophets were
[38:20] called son of man.
[38:23] son of man.
[38:25] And Peter said, thou art the Christ,
[38:30] son of the living God.
[38:32] And he said, Peter, flesh and blood has
[38:35] not revealed this,
[38:38] but my
[38:41] father.
[38:43] Now, let's put it right now.
[38:46] Peter says,
[38:49] "The Jews never knew about this.
[38:52] The son of man was the Christ.
[38:56] Now Peter says, "Thou art the Christ,
[39:01] son of the living God." And he said,
[39:03] "Peter,
[39:05] it's a revelation.
[39:07] [Applause]
[39:09] The father you worship
[39:12] has now given you a revelation
[39:15] [Applause]
[39:16] for the next dispensation.
[39:23] Amen. For a Jew
[39:27] to know that he is the Christ
[39:30] in those days was a revelation.
[39:36] Amen. Amen. So that's why he says Peter
[39:40] this is a very important thing
[39:43] the father has revealed this to you that
[39:47] I the prophet
[39:49] am the Christ
[39:54] you see the difference now
[39:57] amen and as he said to that woman the
[40:00] time will come that they will worship
[40:02] the father
[40:04] and now now is Now
[40:07] the Jews do worship like this, but there
[40:11] will be another time.
[40:14] And he was referring to the end time
[40:19] when the son of man
[40:21] will be revealed again.
[40:25] Amen.
[40:27] Now I'm reading here
[40:30] because he must be reveal. It's not by
[40:33] reading.
[40:35] It's not by reading, it's by revelation.
[40:41] So he was revealed to them.
[40:44] Then he said to them, "Tell no man
[40:48] that I, the son of man, am the Christ."
[40:53] Because it was a new thing
[40:57] to the Jews that this man is the Christ.
[41:04] That's why uh the Samaritan woman
[41:07] he said come and see
[41:12] come and see a man
[41:16] because he was a man.
[41:20] Come and see a man.
[41:24] Listen what he says now. How she picked
[41:26] up this
[41:29] they don't know.
[41:32] Amen. Amen. Come and see. Firstly, come
[41:35] and see a man.
[41:39] Come and see a man
[41:42] who told me all things
[41:44] that ever I did.
[41:47] Is not this the Christ.
[41:52] They were looking. She was looking for a
[41:54] man,
[41:56] a man that is the Christ.
[42:01] What made things different
[42:04] was that this one was the Christ.
