[Music] me me [Music] ga bariki I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ thanking the Lord for this opportunity today and I believe he has blessed us to bless us and she said wait it's a wedding day [Music] so our looking I'm looking at the time I just agree I greet my pastors here and everybody today and I believe I'm just going straight to read in the Bible from the Bible for officiating God has blessed Pastor season and the family today and we're here to Rejoice together with them our pastor and their family and also glad to see our pastor seated here we believe that God is gonna bless us eventually now I'm going to read from the book of Genesis because it is ready for the wedding amen amen okay shall we bow our heads our heavenly father we come today as we have come today thank you for this wonderful service [Music] this morning this afternoon we have blessed Pastor seizure and the family and we have come as witnesses to witness the blessings thanking you for this wedding that you're gonna bless the two today your children and they will remain blessed for it was instituted by you know the First Time In the Garden of Eden when you bro you you you brought the men and the woman together and bless them so we are here Lord for the blessings again upon the couple that will be standing here thank you Lord as I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen okay I'm going to tend to the Bible Genesis chapter 24 you may be seated amen and Abraham was old and worst weekend in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things say [Music] unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all the all that he had put us pray thee thy hand under thy five and I will make this way by the Lord that God of heaven and god of the earth that Thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among them among whom I dwell but Thou shalt go unto my country and to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac seven said unto himesha the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must I need bring thy son again into the land from whence thou cameth and Abraham said unto him beware that thou shall not bring not my son Tita again [Music] I'll give you I'm trying to be short [Music] now it was the elders in the House of Abraham to find a wife for Isaac the eldest then God also in the last days the seventh angel messenger the elders in the house of God this this angel this messenger which is the eldest in the house of the Lord for his bride as we read here now we believe that I believe that it was the bloodline marriage and he said to the evidence as I continue here he said and I will make this way by the Lord the god of Heaven the god of the Earth that thou shalt not take a wife and to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but thou shall go unto my country uh because he was of the royal Thou shalt go unto my country and to my Kindred and take a wife and to my son so the wife wants to come through the life through the bloodline amen and now the same what God has done for the Bride of his son the bride should come through the bloodline that's why brother Branham says when Gabriel came to Mary [Music] am and said blessed are those the prophet of God says one marriage when the angel spoke to Maryam and when Mary accepted the word and said be it unto me according to the time [Music] according to the time of life so he says when Mary believes that word and believe the word that Gabriel spoke unto him that word became blood in the room of marriage because it it has to come through the bloodline just like the bride of Christ meaning that the rate that we have received it's actually the blood because when he spoke to Mary that very same way became in the womb of Mary then a son was born unto us amen amen meaning that the message that we believe and we have received has become blood in us now that blood that Mary that blood became it tends to be the way now just we see this messenger of God when he arrived there well that's where the women in the evening time would come for to collect water [Music] so the angel arrived in the evening for the bride and when she he arrived there his duties and expecting to see this young woman and it was in the evening time the evening time when women are she was not at her best because coming from work even in time this is the time when they will start the women start to be busy so that was the time that the angel arrived when Rebecca was not at her best I mean she took off whatever she had during the day I she remained with a character I'm talking about because the womb the angel was looking for a character not just a woman and that's why even our brother here when uh he was blessed and he was thinking of getting married he came to the right place the end time message to find a character he picked up a character foreign we have come to see a character that has picked up a character okay sorry he said to the messenger go and take Amanda he didn't say go and look for a for a wife but the wife was already there because he never said a girlfriend but go and find a wife because the wife was already and she was already there for the angel to come amongst the women now in the message it is like a sister in the message it's like a a woman [Music] where women come on to collect the word of God amen amen because you must first find the right place before you can take a wife you should first find the place that the wife for his son is somewhere in the evening time she was in the evening time only to find her too because she was already chosen Isaac's wife only the messenger was supposed to go and pick and the person to bring her to their husbands amen amen okay now we will see that later but I as we read in the Bible how the messenger went arriving at the world for a character and after finding this character he came with the character to her brothers he was just the home of this woman he spoke to the brothers and said to them he narrated to them how he met and after that he said to them now if you will deal currently and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that I may turn to the right hand or to the left what happened is he narrated to them first and said behold when he arrived at the world he narrated to these brothers how he has found this their sister man because this woman also she saw Isaac in the evening time she was also picked up in the evening time to meet Isaac in the evening times now he said to the brothers now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master the thing proceedeth from the Lord marriage is from the Lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or Goods is okay so yet I need to read something here for the past yes foreign what did you say here is what I said all right I'm trying to shorten our time here all right now salsa I'm going back to the scriptures they said unto him it came to pass I'm I'm sorry because I'm I'm in a hurry the time is against me all right I'll start again here and now the messenger taking to the brothers if you will deal currently and truly with my master tell me and if not now tell me that I may tend to the right hand or to the left hand they said the thing procedures from the Lord [Music] what the God has said concerning this marriage and it came to pass that when Abraham VII hit their ways Worship the Lord amen bowing himself to the Earth and the Seven brought forth jewels of silver and the jewels of gold and Remnant and gave them to Rebecca also and to her brother to her mother precious things and they did it and drink and tear it all night they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master now [Music] uh okay now now I will end up here and they said before this they brought jewels of silver and Joseph this is what we are going to do just to cut the time short Ness Okay so I I will call in trying to cut short the time here I will call the pasta my pastor where's my pastor foreign a customer uh sorry I'm actually somebody was supposed to run this password but God will bless our efforts now we have a brother Cornelius Cornelius sorry shija [Music] are gay so we will summon them on
