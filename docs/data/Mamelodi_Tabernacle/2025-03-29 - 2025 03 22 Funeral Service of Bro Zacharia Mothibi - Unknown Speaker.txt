he was [Music] gifted where some of us we couldn't in school he will always outshine us yeah he then went to high school and then we separated I went to work I went to that's when I need work I said come come to and then we stay together staying together to him look I've seen lady and then I want to marry this dum and he said to will you handle it I said no I'll try when I looked at him I'm not sure what he was actually not sure about on what I was saying and then I got married and I stay my wife and I'm still staying with her and then he then got married [Music] after and came to that's where he then worked [Music] and then we had also the problem Zak loved Church very much will say come to church I will say to him I'll come and then and then we went to see him while he was not well at and then passed away went and buried and then I was with him then he [Music] brother when we then separated I left my jacket in his car he left with my jacket to his house [Music] I called him and told him that I left my jacket in your car I will come back with [Music] it then he never managed to come back in24 then started not feeling well I called him but he then informed me that I'm actually sick I said what is troubling you he said look the doctor said I had an I have an issue with my liver be well now look because the flesh it was really strain amen amen God bless you Ma greetings to you in the name of Jesus Christ uh thank for the opportunity to come and just talk a short about my friend yesterday you have heard or you were informed that was once arrested I think he was arrested because he was at the wrong place with the wrong people I don't think he was part of that amen amen then uh and he moved to another school where he met me and then we start friendship there amen amen so indeed he was a man a good man I know [Music] brother both sides before and after being a message believer amen amen he he played an essential role H for what I am today and I think he is very much happy that he he talked to somebody that today is something in what he was preaching in by his life amen amen so we were boys when we met at gr 10 at today's language then it was standard 10 yes if I put it correctly not standard 10 stand standard eight form three let me put this way form three yes yeah we were together doing form three yes the other speak was genius in in books but we competing with him sometimes I will surpass you yeah he he he was aware that I'm doing very well he could do in biology but he cannot outside me in my mother time maybe he can do well in history but I will do well in geography we can do well in uh agriculture agure yeah we learn agriculture I was thinking that you know when you were still young and you at the school they will try to teach you everything life skill you know so that when you are grown up you are able to choose but uh that's how we were amen amen now we we grw together and then until today now I didn't know the suffering of my brother in as the the other speakers said because he was close to me he could share everything I even advise him to go other doctors when he came from this doctor he said to me you know this doctor of yours I don't like you because he told me things that I don't want to listen to hear I said you know my friend you need to do exactly what he has told you to do amen amen but then we were giving advice each other yes and you know if I'm not well you will come and pick me up if he's not well I'll come and pick him up I will also drive him wherever I wants to drive him he wants to drive yes we have family friends amen amen now the good things brother MV is the good thing about him I I won't say was because he's not dead He's Alive he is listening us attentively as we speak right now because what I'm saying I'm a witness to it I know when a person comes out of this body where he goes to he's still alive he sees and he yes I'm not just saying because I I believe the the scriptures I am a beli of the scriptures and I live for them amen amen now what I'm saying is truth and it remain truth like that amen amen now he he is he was just like that amen amen we the brother has intimidated me because I I yeah let me leave that way H that's how he is brother and that's how we we we lived now the Bible says amen amen chapter 12 chapter 12 he says we need to seek the face of God while we're still young and then that's what brother mtiv did because the Bible say says again in verse two that when you need to seek him when there are no where the stars and the moon and the sun are still shining because the time of darkness comes so brother did that and he also bring it to me so that when I in 19 86 we I I took this decision to to do exactly what he was doing then he showed me the light and then I followed that light I remember I was another church I said you know what your church is exactly the same as mine then he said no just come in and listen and then after some time and then I realized that yeah there's a difference here because this was calling what is in me I'm a person that once I see something I won't lose it he was very humble but those who know me my character but we managed to blend God bless you thank you amen God bless you sir uh to all speakers I I am fairly allocating 5 minutes for every speaker uh I've got a clever watch on my hand I just uh give you exactly that then I will stand up next to you if you go overboard amen uh 5 minutes is actually more than enough 3 minutes is is good for you to say what you need to say but uh because um you know it's a

50-54 amen Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up The Ghost and behold the veil of the temple was ran in Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now when the Centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of God Amen you may be seated yeah I can see now I'm complaining to my time it's 9:00 9 I will be done will be going to the Grave amen amen we read the scripture and then my message this morning is why death of our brother came before Rapture amen I've got the key words the the the graves open and the Saints were seen by many amen amen after our Lord Jesus Christ cried with a loud voice when he cried with a loud voice it was just not a normal voice it was a special voice and since the world began there was never a cry like that there was never a voice like that a voice when he uttered when he yielded up the goat when he died on the cross many things have happened that has never happened before as we read here the veil since was done many years ago when the veil hear the cry and the voice of our Lord Jesus Christ rented into amen many people s and they priest and they were passing the veil the high priest to the most holy and the holy place and the outer court but the veil was intact but when Jesus Christ Ed that voice that Veil rent into it was not an Ordinary Day from top to bottom the Earth shook amen the Rocks rent that was the voice of Jesus Christ when he yielded up the amen it didn't end there the graves were open hallelujah amen when the graves were open make bodies of the Saints which slept arose because of the voice of Jesus Christ there was a reason for them and when we die they take us to the same graveyard as any other people but when the Resurrection come it's only for the special people it's only for the Saints only the Saints rose up the remained in the grave and the Bible says those saints that rose up walked in Jerusalem and many have seen them if one day you started to see your loved one who departed come and have a lunch with you come and have a dinner with you come and walk with you and the only thing that he can tells you is the things of beyond the he he will tell you what is happening you you will have comfort from him because he will tell you that yes we wake up we have heard the voice we have had the Cry of our Lord Jesus Christ of our creator and they Rose they started to walk around amen since the world began this has never happened it was only in the time of Jesus and that was the first fruit and that will never stop there that should happen again before the reptor takes place before we go up the graves must open the dead should rise and we should spend time with them reason why took you know it's for what it's for him he he is the sign of the Rapture he is the sign of the Rapture when Rapture is about to happen we will see him he will come to his house he will greet his wife he will greet his kids he will greet the church he will tell them within 40 days you know those that go before us we mustn't cry but we must know that it is the our the sign of the Rapture is when The Departed s come to life again greet us tell us what is happening beyond the K of time and then after 40 days go when I've heard our our Elder has departed and I must stand to to say a word of comfort come to me the reason why he go is for us to come and see him before we amen amen when those Saints Rose and spend time with the families with the children of God they were telling them within 40 days we go prepare yourself hallelujah amen and then after 40 days or in 40 days when Jesus rise he died on the cross for three days he rose up he spent time with them after spending time with them when he rise he took only those Saints the Bible says they were looking at Jesus when he was going then the disciples were amazed what is happening here what is the confusion all about then the Comfort angel came close by and say Brothers the way you see him going is the way you will see com let's read that scripture it's in act chapter one you will have an understanding as I always say I always fight with my wife about this I I I beat goodbye every day I'm ready to die any because death was placed by God to go before Rapture and come back and Rapture so we must die amen amen we read Acts chapter 1 verse 2 and 3 chapter 1 verse 23 yes until the day in which he was taken up after that he threw is it the one chapter verse 9 Acts chapter 1 verse 9 CH verse 2 and 3 Acts chapter 1 Acts chapter 1 yes 2 and 3 yes until the day in which he was taken up yes after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the Apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his Passion by many aables proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God amen amen after he rose they were on the way to OS and he was with them started to talk with and they they could see for 40 days and the other saints were in the city for 40 days amen amen now 9 and 10 yes 9 to 11 to 11 yes and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly towards him Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by him in white apparel which also said ye men of Galilee why stand he gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as he have seen him go into heaven amen amen you know a Bible is a book of [Music] Prophecy now here the Bible says the two men they were not just two men they were two angels angels of comfort bringing Comfort to the disciples because they are confused that the way you see him going up he will come like that man amen amen meaning the world will never come to an end until this scripture is fulfilled I want to tell you this day this scripture is fulfilled we do not have a time anymore because they saw him going up while they were confused the angel came and conforted and say Brothers you don't have to worry the way he goes is the way he will come now we must wait for the day in 1963 brother BR said to the entire world that he came in the cloud everyone saw him up there it was our Lord Jesus Christ in 19633 amen amen after that the Bible here says Jesus Christ when he was up he came to them when they were 12 at the upper room like the pillars of fire is the same Jesus in the Pentecost amen and he started operating from there that was the beginning of the church age when the church ages started there's a cloud and a pillar of fire that's when the church ages start when the church ages to an end we need to see the pillar of fire and we need to see the cloud again when we started to see this two sign the pillar of fire and the cloud at the last Church age the time is no more amen amen in 1963 we saw the cloud the same Jesus who was at the beginning of the church the pillar of Fire came in the head of brother Bram showing I have started with the peer of fire I have started with the cloud I will finish with the pillar of fire I will finish with the cloud now when he was operating from there coming to an end in 1963 when we do not see the cloud anymore did it just disappear no when that cloud goes up during the first church AG start at the Pentecost that cloud became the pure fire in the heart of the s that cloud of brother BR that we saw in 1963 it became the pillar of fire in the heart of the Saints when you want the Lord Jesus Christ today go to the Saints go to the children of God you will see all the characteristics of God I said it previously be a son and a daughter of God until the people think you are the creator of and think you are God because they will look at you and check all the characteristics of God they are in you amen amen let's read from the question and answer what brother Bram says he said he was crucified died Rose the third day was on Earth 40 days men after he risen ascended up into heaven told them to wait until they seen the kingdom of God come upon them at this time the father will Resto the kingdom in a spiritual form to them they went up to the city of Jerusalem waited there for 10 days and night and all of a sudden the baptism of the Holy Spirit the kingdom of God come with power upon them is that right brother Bram trying to tell us for 40 days when Jesus was on Earth after he reison the Saints has resurrected they waited another 10 days because Pentecost juilee 50 number on the 50th day came again upon them his Jubilee time and they receive him as the pillar of fire brother here says every one of us every one of us children of God we have the guardian angel there's an angel that is always looking after you when you want to do wrong that angel stopped you when brother Bram was a young man wanted to do many wrongs but the guardian angel that God has prepared for him stopped him until he was perfect before God the guardian angel is only for the children of God because the guardian angel is the one that behold the face of those are your representation in amen amen let's continue there's no such a thing as tiring meeting you have been an ER doesn't means pray t means to wait after the Ascension after Jesus Christ the crucifixion the cleansing of the sanctuary and after the day of the atonement the Resurrection the day of atonement when he was killed then it's 40 days until the Ascension and then Pentecost the word Pentecost means 5050 days offering of the at amen amen in the Old Testament there were sacrifices That Couldn't cleans your sin and your iniquities and your transgression but it was a covering through the blood until the real blood of the Lamb come as an atonement between you and God that is why when he died on the cross he was between the Heaven and the Earth for him to be the gateway to heaven when you believe the Lord Jesus Christ you believed his blood has cleansed you you are on the way to heaven amen amen and then on the 50th the same Jesus who ascended descended again to his church the day of Pentecost then that's when he started to build his brother when we speak about the Bride of Jesus Christ we start from the day of Pentecost the day of the first CH day of Ephesus until to the L that is the Bride of Jesus Christ before that beyond that is not the bride is the people that will serve the bride in the new city the city Jerusalem bread of Jesus Christ started at Pentecost until today so the same thing that God did in the first chur he do them on the last Church how he started how he end and he end things at the higher not amen Amen brother Brenham as the seventh angel when he come on the sea Bible says Paul was a prophet brother bam says Paul was a prophet but brother BR was not just a prophet was more than a prophet he was the one who fixed all that were messed along the way he was the one who had the right to tell you that you are the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ you are s you are spotless you are without wrink you must just stay in life amen Amen brother Bram says one day when he he he was talking to a certain Minister amen am maybe this can help you as well we have an angel we have comfort angel Angels yesterday was talking about the death Angels amen amen he said some time ago a minister told me said brother there's no such a thing of seeing Angels Angels don't lead the church the Holy Ghost leads the church if you don't know the scriptures be confused because listen to the statement the the Holy Ghost lead the church there's no such thing as Angels but listen to brother when he answered me he said I said that's right but we still have Angelic being as Minister Spirit sent from the present of God God sent angel and was sending angel he's still sending angels even today God still sent angels He said well our church don't believe in that then brother Bram says I don't know what your church believes I know what the Bible teaches said well brother Angels might have been back in Daniel's time there but not since the holy ghost is come no Angels said to him you believe that Philip had the Holy Ghost he said certainly he said but the Bible say Philip Having the Holy Ghost one of the days they were in a meeting when they were in a meeting the Bible says the angel of the Lord came to him having the holy GH you still need an angel to give you the guidance and the angel said to him Philip go this way because I have a man who's reading the Bible and does not have understand I want you to go and explain to him that was the angel him to feel the Holy Ghost amen amen he said to him again do you know Paul Paul was a great s 14 days and night and night no moon all hopes they ever been saved was God and he went in the gallery to pray and he come out wherefore be of a good courage for the angel of God whose servant I am stood by me last night saying Fe not Paul the angel of God Having the Holy Ghost is not ending there having the Holy Ghost you need the angel that is why men of God says the pastor is the angel to the church Having the Holy Ghost you need the pastor as the angel to give you the guidance you know other people want to be loners I'm Having the Holy Ghost I controlled by the Holy Ghost go back and read your Bible again Having the Holy Ghost you need an answer let me tell you family you need an angel not just an Guardian Angel but the angel of you know when when we preach here comfor in the family everybody here you have that niess in your hand you have that confidence in your hand but the moment everybody's gone the moment alone as a family that's when it hits home that's when you realize there we need our debt more than yesterday when you are in that miserable situation is when the angel of comfort must come and say my son my wife my daughter my Saints don't worry the time shall come where the date shall rise the grave shall be open you shall see spend time with them and we together amen amen that's why we need one another even if you can acquire all the things that the world needs of this world brother sister there's something in you that does not need what the world have there is something that needs the world of God there is something that needs just an advice or a word from a brother or from a sister I don't know I've experienced this I don't know about you there are moments when you are down really you don't know what to do but you think let me just phone someone but after phoning that person even if you can crack some joke but that small talk once you dropped the cone you feel like oh yeah am I again does that need money no it needed a call it needed a speech from someone qu that amen that's why the Bible says without money without price because the word of God is queened by the word of God amen amen your heart need the word of God amen amen the man of God continue he said luk just before the coming of the righteous one the great son of God God sent an angel you know God have seen that Peter John James and them they are confused since the world began they were never seen the Dead Rising Jesus going up with a FL that's why God sent an angel two of them to them and said don't worry he's gone he he will come back the way you have seen him and the only time that he came back the way they saw him is US experiencing them he continu and say and that angel come to a home that was a respected home if you want Angel to visit your home be like home him and Sarah was living ight before the Lord keeping all the statutes of the Commandment of the Lord living in perfect obedience to the word in in the light that they had and zakaras his office was to wave incense B incense at the altar while people were pray and while he was waving this standing on the right hand of the altar stood Gabriel great archangels now the angels can come but when you hear of Gabriel coming be ready something major on the road Gabriel announced first coming of Jesus and Gabriel announced the second coming of Jesus the word of God said to brother when he was baptizing the 17th person said to him as John the Baptist was the Forerunner of the first coming of the Lord you are send to be the second runner of the second coming of the Lord that means in our time during the time of brother BR the Lord must come with the cloud the Lord must come with the pillar of fire like it happen before them amen amen thank God today we are the beneficiaries of that thing now notice Gabriel came to zaras remember zakaras had the Holy Ghost but they having the Holy Ghost he needed an answer he was old his wife had always prayed for children what a different today it is it's a shame the way our nation is the people is poting the nation no sir I I don't believe it isn't communism that is going to hurt us it's our own rottenness right amongst us is what hurting us let me jump to 42 here was Zakaria standing I want you to notice he said now after the days of the ministration here you go home to your wife she's going to conceive and bear a son and you'll call his name John and look at the colors men now that just goes to show about how colors people can get there were plenty of example can be H Sarah and then of being 100 years olded a child and this things can't be my wife is too old but he said to to to to to Zakaria I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God my words will be fulfilled in their season but you will be dump till the day the baby's born because he didn't believe what God was telling him the reason why God take our brothers and our sisters before the Rapture is for them to rise God could have just taken us our way long time AG but God has prepared us so that when we leave at the right time we shall rise and be with our family be with our friends be with our church members after 40 days we will Rapture to cry is there when somebody departs you can cry there's nothing wrong here but don't miss the mark because the main thing is right at the backside of God God knows about it the day you see him the joy you will have is unmeasurable amen amen have you ever imagined or let's not imagine because the word of God it's Faith amen amen one of the day when you try to to make a breakfast and you left one said please prepare for me as well you will be shocked to the death for but because God prepared you you start to realize oh you are here that means soon we are about to go let's have lunch let's have breakfast will have lunch and dinner tell me what is going on beyond the amen amen then he will start explaining to that is the only comfort that you will have because the only way to be where they are is for us to follow them amen amen so in those those old days there were Paradise God took them out of the Paradise and put them on the sixth dimension under the altar where they are happy forever where they see no Sinners anymore in the paradise they could see Sinners and in the paradise the Sinners could see them in the sixth Dimension it's a Way Beyond the K of time and next to the sixth Dimension is the seventh Dimension and God took the fifth dimension underneath the world so two World apart one the Bible says that one who used to report you before God does not have chance any our God is a good god Our God work with dispensation there was a time where God allowed the devil to report you to have you seen brother have you seen sister God allowed there but today is not allowed devil and the Sinners do not have access to the sixth Dimension or the seventh Dimension anymore that Dimension is right the fifth one and the fifth one is the underworld that is The Fifth Dimension no one from The Fifth Dimension can go to to the sixth Dimension but the people in the sixth Dimension can go to The Fifth Dimension you know after God has done all these things he allowed the children of God you know after living this Amen to go anywhere anytime you can see them with a naked eye but when was say I don't remember yes he he's looking at us do you know that that is true he's looking at us he's in another body we don't see him he is seeing him and he is thinking this message that after receiving this message has taken me to the better place he is in a better place where he is he said Lord God make it quick huh let those people come quick yet because where we are we enjoy ourselves it happen exactly to brother BR let's follow this message this message is a reality God took brother BR the sixth Dimension when he was there then he said Lord God I'm not going back there I'm not going back to that c no no no no no then God said to him I brought you here to taste this when you go back you can be able to tell them what you have seen what you have heard so that when they believe they see what you please unto them now brother Bram when he comes back he came back with the Assurance he said to the church I saw you there you know we were just walking in the world here while walking the world here but brother Bram come and said to us I have seen when when we work we work for that Bo has seen there brother BR God took him again to The Fifth Dimension to the under to the hell that is not burning when he get there he saw the people one day when he was walking he saw the people he has seen there and he said to the church saw these people down there this ministry that we are following is beyond our thinking is the ministry that can show us what is happening in hell what is happening in heaven this morning let me be honest with you already all of us we know where we are going we know who we are we know our stand with Christ if you are the citizen of the underworld I cannot take you to heaven if you are the citizen of Heaven I cannot take you below there's a complete job son but I have Assurance this morning that our Elder M TV young again I want to tell you this if there is heaven to go if there is heaven to go is in heaven we are just going to take the body to the Grave where it belong but the soul has reached the Destin the day disintegrate hallelujah amen when Jesus Christ died on the cross the Bible says the flesh was in the grave everybody sees on the grave Mary was crying Peter went back to fish and the others lie they don't want to associate themselves with because they see the Flesh in the grave they lost hope but there was alive beyond the grave when you go beyond the grave when you go to the spiritual reality the Bible says his spirit amen went back to God his soul go to the uttermost when it get there brothers and sisters I normally say this I will when you have hit the point of no return no one can help you amen he soul a soul is a being amen it's a body structure but a spirit is a breath of life but a flesh is this body because the soul of Jesus Christ went down when it get down there it preaches to the lost soul not for their repent they have heit the point of no return even if they hear the word of God they will never repent for here the Bible says the Centurion when he see the the the veil when he see the earthquake when he see the sun and the Stars responding when he see the people rising from the grave the Centurion The Sinner Centurion he turned back and said indeed he was the son of God indeed he was the son of God has never helped him has never taken to Heaven he remained a sin so the word of God is not going to change us the word of God is just going to make better us if you are a sinner you are a better sinner if you are a Christian you become better Christian that's what the word of God came here amen amen there's no longer time for repentance we have HIIT the point of we have taken our way the word of God is like a magnet it down amongst if you are all the same material you catch on it if it's not the same material you repel and Fa if I have a Ste an iron magnet the aluminium will never catch if I need the steel only the steel will amen am if the word of God is the magnet and coming down those magnet has the pieces on Earth they will click to the magnet if you are a child of God to begin with when the word of God is being preached you just catch up one day Paul was preaching the whole when he was prison the whole life a young man fell and Di amen amen since you have heard about that it was it ended there he died Paul prayed for him he rise that did not make him a Christian if he was a sinner he will go back to the school of keming and tell them that hey that church is so dangerous you die to raise you that is not going to make him a Christian and he will never go to that church again because that church is not for him if the word of God is not for you we can pray we can fast we can try
