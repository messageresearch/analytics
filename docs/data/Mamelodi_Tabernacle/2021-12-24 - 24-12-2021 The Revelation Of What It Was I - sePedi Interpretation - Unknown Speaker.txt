TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] then [Music] am i there you are not now coming down the the eden was placed eastward there's a reason eastward he went [Music] [Music] that's when god came to drive them out of the garden they went oh so is it for everybody then there worship god just at the gate it was in the heart of men wanting to go back amen now so that's why okay [Music] due to illusion they came to the altar but they raised the denomination and then knowing that it is blood that did it in the garden now it will take blood to return away that is the revelation it has because [Music] [Music] which we have had that which we have heard from the beginning now if you have heard it from the beginning [Music] this john he positioned himself as one of them who heard him speak anger [Music] you will the thing that we believe is the thing that we have believed is [Music] no okay that we have which we have seen with our eyes what that's why you can't but in here there was something very very special prostitute in jail what is and speaking from inside of her heart [Music] now once a person says i know don't try to argue with him because she says [Music] you can argue with the person who doesn't know but not the one with the one who knows now watch i knew uh maybe somebody would say you are a prostitute um [Music] a prostitute knowing that the messiah [Music] they didn't know the prostitute said i perceive that [Music] because you told me all the things that i have done [Music] messiah amen amen and so now uh [Music] let's come down to this now this is the gate they came out he drove them out then they started to worship there at the gate well thomas they came here to worship god at the gates we know how god now um i read here [Music] and they showed us the place where the prophet stood before you know we have spoken it even before that restoration is when god would restore if there was a sword there at the gate then god is asked to restore that sword back to the gate you know how there was a gap today yeah we were trying to show here very like after adam forfeited the the book i tried to talk about it somewhere but it didn't work [Music] at the gate after camera after adam forfeited the [Music] [Music] standing in [Music] because the angels [Music] can you take have this so to show something in closing here that's the pyramid keeper media right there it is oh yeah let me turn around yeah that's the pyramid keep it immediate foreign [Music] the ministry will be ready foreign like we said last time yeah why why the people don't see the seventh season it is because now the people haven't seen that angel with the seventh seal all right if you are if you are winding big which [Music] the it is in the spoken way people spoke in the day you know when these things are preached by the sons of god uh really no one will understand them peter peter [Music] my not this eyewitness is so fast amen coming down having seen moses whatever these three guys they'll tell you that you have seen moses amen now the message is now getting more deeper to confuse the people for the people who were there [Music] he never said i got so confused so it was not for their first time to meet uh you wonder because you don't you are not aware that you met them before my god in that cycle of eternity [Music] said where shall we go amen amen but because they were together so where shall we go for the words words before what i would remind you of what really believes he has met him before feeling to him is the sound of the words of eternal life [Music] still hear you because these are the ways of eternal life it's not just a ceremony you [Music] oh expect to see us we have eternal life if the people threatened me with death it doesn't bother me because say wasn't saying god told bunny i shall not die i'll be so thankful because within a second i would be somewhere else do you fear death now because death is just a passage for us is he [Music] and that's when stevens thought that it's my time to to to go we are like our recipe and the body mainly yours for you anchor for where now you are that soul well so real heaven opens up [Music] you know i hope as we said god loved it he knocked so much and the bible says god just took him in the form of jesus job pleased god so much until god decided just to take him once and god he will get so happy with us because if i look back there was no grave there [Music] yeah okay some somebody will ask as some people think like that [Music] dynamics if you put a thing like this on a day and somebody can is to make it easier for the they put me in the pyramid of themselves those [Music] and that's what confuses became of angels in [Music] because it is until the devil is pushed down the bottomless pit he won't fix tell us himself but they come to church and even foreign foreign foreign [Music] moses do you believe that then they came up with a list of seven of them who came to the church hey one day the lord willing the people you'd expect to be christians god has given us the eyes to see them do you want to feed them even to talk to them even to talk to them during the middle of the night let me stop right there jesus hey h [Music] the devil cannot win against us because before they can kill bewitch him [Music] but [Music] [Music] huh that's why every time we hear that this and this [Music] let moses because he has given him the but in the midst forward now if god says go forward [Music] moses [Music] [Music] was not predestinated to cross the sea only god [Music] moses you see today these wizards you see today you see today we shall never see them again look after the war yes go forward because the destination is not here earlier the [Music] the destination because of the circumstances and you lose the faith that's when you will sing [Music] foreign amen since we now we we we will take it because we have come to the uh constellation of the engines really my m today there was a storm that you know started down there when i mentioned that the prophet says you are a foreign removed [Music] what is witchcraft he said let them overcome our faith amen now we thank the lord for just this party more [Music] perfection [Music] [Music] [Music] seriously with our eyes sorry yes if you are a child of god you don't see through somebody else's eyes that's why you see today the people who haven't seen god but come back with you even for the what god has said that they are by my stripes you were healed instead of their is business my mama and her daughter came to to me and the deacon we were there at the 250 each now it is impossible because the elect is the word of god now that's what i told you last time i asked this moment [Music] the prophet has prayed for the word for me to drink foreign [Music] she didn't know i said um if you wanted water and you want a prayer before you drink that water you can pray for that water yourself [Music] [Music] [Music] talking about the of his [Music] let us now if god these you shall know that i am [Music] okay [Music] that's when you all right take this book let me leave this place a child of god with you if you are a child of god you are not trying to be only what you see reach that's why i repented for you why you just found yourself knowing the one in me i seen foreign may god bless you amen amen [Music]
