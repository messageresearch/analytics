[1:26:34] fashion you always come in the midst and
[1:26:37] speak to us amen just like you've been
[1:26:41] doing with Israel yes there was a time
[1:26:45] where they gathered
[1:26:48] together and Lord Almighty the Bible
[1:26:51] said you look through a cloud
[1:26:54] when you are looking at
[1:26:57] Israel but with us Lord you are looking
[1:27:00] deep down into our
[1:27:03] hearts the word Lord that you have

[1:27:19] Jesus Christ amen
[1:27:22] amen you may be
[1:27:31] seated
[1:27:33] okay I I have a title
[1:27:37] here I I always like
[1:27:40] to explain my my
[1:27:46] title the title is the
[1:27:50] migration of the processed attributes
[1:28:00] you know the prophet says we we if I had
[1:28:03] to explain the
[1:28:06] title the the the prophet says we are
[1:28:12] processed from
[1:28:15] God and then when we are processed from
[1:28:19] God he also continues that we we are
[1:28:22] attributes
[1:28:25] amen we are
[1:28:28] attributes so then
[1:28:31] now those
[1:28:33] attributes okay let me put it like
[1:28:36] this our great great great
[1:28:43] grandfather
[1:28:46] Adam for the title you know
[1:28:53] about and then God took
[1:28:57] it now the ministry of the third
[1:29:03] pool is of The
[1:29:08] Inheritance it's when that title
[1:29:12] deed has been given over to
[1:29:17] us but order that we should receive that
[1:29:22] title it was a
[1:29:25] processed now because we attributes from
[1:29:30] him we were born in a different
[1:29:35] way
[1:29:37] Adam
[1:29:39] was the Bible says he formed Men Out of
[1:29:43] the Dust of the
[1:29:46] Earth but we were born from our
[1:29:51] parents now after I formed men out of
[1:29:54] the Dust
[1:29:56] of he breathed the breath of
[1:30:00] life and Men became a living
[1:30:03] soul but with
[1:30:06] us we born by our
[1:30:10] parents we had our bodies had the genes
[1:30:13] of our
[1:30:16] parents and the prophet
[1:30:19] says the first
[1:30:22] person that taught you the first
[1:30:27] step it's your
[1:30:29] mother was the one that was teaching you
[1:30:32] how to
[1:30:35] walk and then where you grow a little
[1:30:38] bit
[1:30:40] older your father took
[1:30:44] over so he taught you Administration
[1:30:48] now T you about
[1:30:51] life and thereafter
[1:30:55] your teacher took
[1:30:59] over teaching you about the
[1:31:04] intelligence and
[1:31:06] thereafter God took
[1:31:09] over bringing the divine
[1:31:14] nature are we together amen
[1:31:18] now when
[1:31:20] God brings the divine nature unto you
[1:31:26] it was a
[1:31:29] process until
[1:31:31] right where now you are a fully grown in
[1:31:35] the
[1:31:36] [Music]
[1:31:39] Lord before he can give you the title
[1:31:44] D now now that he has given you the
[1:31:50] title what are you doing with that title
[1:31:53] de
[1:31:55] mind you we are not starting from where
[1:31:59] when you were
[1:32:03] born we are in a point where you have
[1:32:06] already crossed
[1:32:10] over you you've crossed
[1:32:13] over like like the children of Israel
[1:32:16] when they cross the River
[1:32:19] Jordan after crossing the river Jordan
[1:32:24] Moses I mean
[1:32:28] Joshua met the cap of the
[1:32:34] host in other words
[1:32:37] now
[1:32:38] Joshua gave them their
[1:32:43] inheritance when he gave them their
[1:32:46] inheritance what happened
[1:32:49] there now the prophet
[1:32:52] says the the Holy Ghost will raise
[1:32:57] Joshua who will give us our
[1:33:02] inheritance now that they have given us
[1:33:04] our
[1:33:07] inheritance what
[1:33:09] next that's where we are
[1:33:12] now
[1:33:14] because we are the processed
[1:33:19] attributes now at this point
[1:33:24] at this
[1:33:25] hour at this
[1:33:27] moment what are we supposed to
[1:33:31] do right now my my my title then has to
[1:33:35] do with that migration
[1:33:39] now now the
[1:33:42] migration is the
[1:33:46] movement from one part of something to
[1:33:52] another in Zoology
[1:34:05] there's seasonal
[1:34:09] movement animals move according to a
[1:34:15] season from one region to
[1:34:19] another
[1:34:21] pulled by by the changing of
[1:34:25] the the
[1:34:29] season right
[1:34:32] now we have read
[1:34:35] here the
[1:34:37] scriptures he said according as he has
[1:34:40] chosen Us in him before the
[1:34:46] foundation so which means then
[1:34:49] God has chosen Us in him
[1:34:54] that's why the proess the prophet said
[1:34:56] we were
[1:34:58] process who has chosen Us in him before
[1:35:02] the foundation of the
[1:35:04] world that we should be
[1:35:08] holy and Without
[1:35:11] Blame before him in
[1:35:15] love
[1:35:16] now when we when we when we say we are
[1:35:20] the attributes
[1:35:23] we are not looking at this
[1:35:26] body
[1:35:28] no we are looking at the word of
[1:35:34] God that is
[1:35:37] Holy and it's Without
[1:35:40] Blame and before
[1:35:42] him now in our
[1:35:46] case our
[1:35:50] inheritance is the revealed word
[1:35:55] or is the fullness of the
[1:35:59] way are we together now what is the
[1:36:04] revealed weight and what is the fullness
[1:36:06] of
[1:36:08] [Music]
[1:36:09] the we know that in the beginning was
[1:36:12] the
[1:36:13] word the word was with God the word is
[1:36:19] God and if the word is God
[1:36:23] when
[1:36:25] God uh brings the word unto
[1:36:29] us and we receive
[1:36:31] it and he revealed
[1:36:34] it and then after the
[1:36:39] revelation of that way we speak about
[1:36:42] the fullness of
[1:36:44] the it's now a full
[1:36:49] we but now it was a process
[1:36:53] to the fullness of
[1:36:56] the are we together now but God when he
[1:37:00] look at us he look at us through the
[1:37:04] way he only see
[1:37:08] fullness he only see
[1:37:12] Perfection are we together that is why
[1:37:15] he says now he chose
[1:37:18] us and after he knew
[1:37:21] us and he called
[1:37:25] right amen he called us because he knew
[1:37:30] us but that thing was done before the
[1:37:33] foundation
[1:37:35] of
[1:37:38] [Music]
[1:37:40] okay so now it's a seasonal
[1:37:46] movement uh now in our
[1:37:50] case it's a dispens ational
[1:37:56] Movement we we move according to the
[1:37:59] just read verse 9 up to 11 uh from verse
[1:38:03] 9 it's saying yeah same same same
[1:38:05] chapter chapter one Ephesians chapter 1
[1:38:08] verse
[1:38:09] 9 having made known unto
[1:38:12] us the mystery of his will according to
[1:38:16] his good pleasure which he has proposed
[1:38:18] in himself okay fine it says having made
[1:38:20] known unto us the mystery of his
[1:38:28] will there is a will within
[1:38:31] him but but it's a mysterious
[1:38:36] will it's a mystery that is why whenever
[1:38:40] we speak about the seventh
[1:38:43] seed we say it is revealed in a secret
[1:38:50] Myst see because God whatever he do he
[1:38:56] do it in a mysterious
[1:39:00] way the
[1:39:01] bride is the mystery
[1:39:05] itself so as you
[1:39:08] are you are a
[1:39:10] mystery the word of God is a
[1:39:14] mystery right now when it says having
[1:39:18] made known unto
[1:39:20] us the mystery of his
[1:39:26] will now he had a
[1:39:29] will but when he brings it forth to
[1:39:34] us it comes in a mysterious
[1:39:38] way it's always hidden in that
[1:39:43] mystery remember last time I read you a
[1:39:48] code where the Prophet was trying to
[1:39:51] explain now you canot explain a
[1:39:54] mystery until he said I feel
[1:39:59] watched they are checking on
[1:40:02] me now the
[1:40:05] prophet what I want to us to notice
[1:40:09] here okay let me finish up
[1:40:11] this Mr of his will according to his
[1:40:15] good
[1:40:18] pleasure which he has
[1:40:22] purposed in
[1:40:24] himself now if he had a
[1:40:27] purpose that is within
[1:40:30] himself he will give
[1:40:33] it to those that have got the same
[1:40:38] purpose he had a
[1:40:41] purpose now his
[1:40:43] purpose can never be
[1:40:46] understood by an ordinary
[1:40:50] person no that is his purpose
[1:40:54] the person that would like to understand
[1:40:57] his
[1:41:00] purpose that person must be
[1:41:03] God he must be exactly like
[1:41:06] him because God understands
[1:41:10] himself now in order that he should
[1:41:13] understand
[1:41:14] himself he should give
[1:41:16] you the understanding of who he
[1:41:20] is now if he gives you that
[1:41:25] understanding he has to make you a God
[1:41:29] first you must be a God
[1:41:32] first a god with small
[1:41:36] G so that you could
[1:41:40] understand are we together amen so
[1:41:45] now that is the purose now in verse 10
[1:41:48] it says that in the dispensation of the
[1:41:51] fullness of time
[1:41:54] he might gather
[1:41:56] together in one all things in
[1:42:07] Christ yeah in the
[1:42:11] dispensation of the fullness of
[1:42:15] time now what I want you to notice
[1:42:19] here is that now the prophet brother
[1:42:22] Brenham
[1:42:26] was a chosen
[1:42:30] Prophet but God didn't choose him to
[1:42:34] make a mark time left right left
[1:42:38] right standing one
[1:42:41] place no God wouldn't like
[1:42:44] that so he want
[1:42:48] him to
[1:42:51] move right that's what I want to show
[1:42:54] you there was a time where the Prophet
[1:42:57] stood made a a mark time left right left
[1:43:01] right standing one
[1:43:05] place until God sent an
[1:43:10] angel to tell him to
[1:43:13] move now the
[1:43:16] church stood stood one at one
[1:43:20] place making a left right left right
[1:43:23] left right until God told the bride to
[1:43:28] cross
[1:43:31] over they shouldn't make a a mark
[1:43:34] time left standing at one place amen
[1:43:37] they must
[1:43:39] move now
[1:43:41] you as the bride of
[1:43:43] Christ you should be in a
[1:43:50] migration you don't stand one place
[1:43:54] you
[1:43:55] move we were in different
[1:44:01] denomination then we
[1:44:02] moved then we had the
[1:44:06] call then we listen to that and then we
[1:44:11] move
[1:44:12] on but our stopping
[1:44:16] place should be the New
[1:44:20] Jerusalem
[1:44:21] right now
[1:44:23] uh the migration is according to the
[1:44:29] dispensation when the children of
[1:44:33] Israel moved out of of
[1:44:37] Egypt on their
[1:44:39] way it was the dispensation that
[1:44:45] changed the
[1:44:47] ministry in each and every
[1:44:50] dispensation the ministry changed
[1:44:55] right Moses took them out with a
[1:44:59] different
[1:45:00] Ministry they crossed the Red
[1:45:03] Sea in the
[1:45:06] desert they had a different
[1:45:09] Ministry it's another
[1:45:11] dispensation until they cross over and
[1:45:14] when they cross over it's another
[1:45:17] dispensation what you need to notice is
[1:45:21] this that after they cross the River
[1:45:25] Jordan they
[1:45:28] met the cap of the
[1:45:33] host now just look at
[1:45:36] there after meeting the the the cap of
[1:45:39] the
[1:45:41] host what was the reaction to
[1:45:45] Israel what was Israel
[1:45:48] doing now that there's a captain of the
[1:45:55] remember the promise
[1:45:56] says they go to the
[1:45:59] land of milk and honey remember Caleb
[1:46:04] and
[1:46:05] Joshua brought
[1:46:07] fruits but after crossing
[1:46:09] over did they get milk and
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:14] honey so after crossing over there was
[1:46:18] no milk and
[1:46:20] honey Caleb himself
[1:46:23] he met
[1:46:26] Giants he's the one that says we will
[1:46:29] eat
[1:46:30] them now it was given to
[1:46:33] him because he said he will eat him
[1:46:37] there are the giants eat
[1:46:40] them see Caleb was given
[1:46:45] Mount hor I mean
[1:46:50] hebon that was the generation
[1:46:54] of
[1:46:56] go very huge
[1:47:00] guys then he was supposed
[1:47:03] to
[1:47:05] fight and
[1:47:07] possess now after crossing
[1:47:10] over you've got your
[1:47:13] inheritance you've given they've given
[1:47:16] Caleb there your
[1:47:18] inheritance and it actually is himself
[1:47:23] said to to to to to to uh to his
[1:47:27] friend joshuaa you remember
[1:47:31] Moses promise me that place give me that
[1:47:35] give
[1:47:36] me the very same place that he say
[1:47:41] dangerous give
[1:47:44] me
[1:47:46] yeah so now when we have our
[1:47:51] inheritance amen we need to bring
[1:47:55] forth what to do after we received our
[1:48:02] inheritance what do we do with that
[1:48:06] inheritance what did Joshua do after he
[1:48:10] met the captain of
[1:48:15] the what did Brother
[1:48:18] do after meeting the notable one
[1:48:24] right amen okay fine let's read another
[1:48:28] scripture here in the Book of
[1:48:31] Matthew and then we will go to some
[1:48:36] quotes remember what we we we're talking
[1:48:39] about the the
[1:48:44] migration since we
[1:48:46] are the attributes of
[1:48:50] God and we are the
[1:48:54] process we don't have any stop
[1:48:58] station there's no stop station where
[1:49:01] we'll be standing there and say
[1:49:08] now Matthew Chapter 13 let's read uh
[1:49:13] verse 10 brother
[1:49:16] Harvest Matthew 13:1 mhm and the
[1:49:21] disciples came and and said unto
[1:49:24] him why speakest thou unto them in
[1:49:27] Parables remember at all
[1:49:31] times the
[1:49:34] ministry is directed to certain
[1:49:40] people those people of that
[1:49:45] Ministry whenever there's a a
[1:49:50] Ministry there are people the the the
[1:49:53] ministry is directed to those
[1:49:56] people the
[1:49:59] others will have
[1:50:02] questions but they will never get an
[1:50:07] answer when when when when we were
[1:50:10] fellowshipping
[1:50:11] yesterday I was saying when when
[1:50:15] Christ met
[1:50:17] Peter he never
[1:50:20] explained he just said follow me
[1:50:25] he was with his
[1:50:28] father so Peter and his brother follow
[1:50:32] Christ left his
[1:50:35] father right amen they never said who
[1:50:39] are you why should we follow
[1:50:42] you and he also never
[1:50:46] explained because they knew each
[1:50:49] other before the foundation of the world
[1:50:53] so they were speaking their own
[1:50:56] language which was not known to Peter's
[1:51:02] father uh you remember Elijah
[1:51:06] also he just touched
[1:51:09] Elisha just touched him never explain
[1:51:12] never sit down and and read codes and
[1:51:15] and
[1:51:17] scriptures he just spoke the Heavenly
[1:51:20] language of a
[1:51:24] and then what did Elish do said wait for
[1:51:28] me he slaughtered his
[1:51:30] cows and said bye-bye to his father he
[1:51:34] recognized that was the physical
[1:51:38] father now he has met a
[1:51:42] supernatural he said byebye and then
[1:51:45] from that day he was
[1:51:48] with
[1:51:50] El are we together amen now here the
[1:51:55] disciples came and said unto
[1:51:58] him why do you speak in
[1:52:01] Parables when you speak to
[1:52:04] them and
[1:52:06] Matthew 13:
[1:52:09] 11 he answered and said unto
[1:52:12] them because it is
[1:52:15] given it is given unto you to know the
[1:52:21] Mysteries
[1:52:24] of the Kingdom of Heaven the Kingdom of
[1:52:28] Heaven is a
[1:52:31] MST it's for a specific
[1:52:36] type and it comes in a mysterious
[1:52:41] way to the other people it's something
[1:52:45] that they cannot
[1:52:46] understand just as the seventh seal
[1:52:51] itself the SE is a
[1:52:55] mystery then it came to the mysterious
[1:52:59] people they understand it because it's
[1:53:01] God
[1:53:03] himself now they
[1:53:07] migrated to a position where they became
[1:53:12] God
[1:53:14] because in the Book of
[1:53:18] John 10:35
[1:53:23] when the word of God comes to
[1:53:25] you it makes you a
[1:53:29] God right amen it's when it when it's
[1:53:33] when
[1:53:34] your your
[1:53:37] jeans changes to that of a natur
[1:53:43] supernatural because you've got the
[1:53:45] human
[1:53:47] genes now you go now to the supernatural
[1:53:53] like like like like Peter
[1:53:56] said that now God let's read it amen uh
[1:54:02] first Peter second
[1:54:05] Peter chapter 1 ver3 just read it my
[1:54:09] prayer chapter 1 verse 3 and 4 just just
[1:54:12] listen to that according as his divine
[1:54:16] power have given unto us all things that
[1:54:19] pertain unto life and godliness so now
[1:54:22] he's speaking that now there is a div
[1:54:25] divine
[1:54:28] power that has given unto
[1:54:30] us all
[1:54:33] things that pertain unto
[1:54:36] life there's a divine
[1:54:41] power that gives
[1:54:44] us all things that pertain unto life and
[1:54:50] godl that has got life
[1:54:54] godliness then he needs to give you a
[1:54:58] divine
[1:55:00] power to have an
[1:55:03] understanding he must give you a spirit
[1:55:05] of knowledge and
[1:55:08] understanding right let's go back to
[1:55:10] Matthew we're not through with that he
[1:55:12] answered and said unto them because it
[1:55:14] is given unto you to know the mysteries
[1:55:17] of the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:55:24] but to them it is not
[1:55:26] given there are those that are
[1:55:29] given there are those that are not
[1:55:32] given so when the two
[1:55:35] meet they don't
[1:55:38] understand because the others are given
[1:55:41] the others are not given you know when
[1:55:44] our Lord Jesus
[1:55:47] Christ went to raise uh tabita
[1:55:54] he called Peter James and
[1:55:58] John and get into the
[1:56:01] house he didn't take the other
[1:56:03] disciples did he take the other
[1:56:06] people he took the
[1:56:09] people brother Bram says he says he took
[1:56:13] faith hope and
[1:56:16] charity he didn't want somebody that is
[1:56:19] not in that PN
[1:56:25] that is not in that
[1:56:27] understanding he took the
[1:56:30] people that when he
[1:56:32] says tell no
[1:56:35] one they don't say why
[1:56:38] shouldn't because they have the
[1:56:41] understanding
[1:56:43] why even if you can tell them who will
[1:56:47] believe you I always say to you you can
[1:56:51] go to heaven now
[1:56:53] meet God sit with God and communicate
[1:56:58] with him and come back and come to us
[1:57:03] and said
[1:57:04] yesterday was
[1:57:07] with nicely together and then he said I
[1:57:11] must greet you we will take you to the
[1:57:16] scope you see no nobody will believe you
[1:57:22] now the ministry of the uh the
[1:57:26] revelation of the
[1:57:29] seven got nothing to do with our
[1:57:35] [Applause]
[1:57:36] understanding it's just people from
[1:57:39] eternity they receive what is
[1:57:42] [Applause]
[1:57:44] theirs it's not for the
[1:57:48] public it's for the
[1:57:50] one that comes from there
[1:57:54] so he
[1:57:56] look Abraham Abraham I me God said
[1:58:01] Abraham go to the place in which I will
[1:58:03] show
[1:58:05] you he showed him the
[1:58:07] place this is Palestine your
[1:58:11] land and then
[1:58:13] Joseph took the children of Israel
[1:58:17] out to
[1:58:20] Egypt and when they go back to the to to
[1:58:24] to to to
[1:58:26] Palestine they go there as the jeans of
[1:58:31] Abraham it's not that they are it's the
[1:58:34] first time that they saw the
[1:58:36] place they
[1:58:38] there their
[1:58:41] forefather knows about it and they come
[1:58:44] from
[1:58:45] him that is why in
[1:58:48] them there is an edge
[1:58:52] there's a
[1:58:54] pool that from their
[1:58:57] forefathers that is their place you won
[1:59:01] change
[1:59:02] them and each and everyone knows
[1:59:07] exactly there was a
[1:59:09] time where
[1:59:13] Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the
[1:59:17] temple and took them away into slavery
[1:59:23] when they came back they didn't
[1:59:26] fumble they know where the foundation
[1:59:31] is and they did not doubt themselves if
[1:59:35] you are
[1:59:35] in one of the House of Benjamin you know
[1:59:39] that I'm
[1:59:42] Benjamin this is
[1:59:45] Ruben they know themselves now we know
[1:59:48] ourselves
[1:59:50] [Applause]
[1:59:52] the the the
[1:59:53] ministry of the third
[1:59:56] pool it does not remind you it restores
[2:00:03] you it takes you back where you
[2:00:06] belong will you will feel that
[2:00:14] now this is my place this is my
[2:00:20] Ministry together amen
[2:00:22] that's how it is then then then that's
[2:00:26] why he says now it is given unto them to
[2:00:31] know the the mysteries of the Kingdom of
[2:00:34] Heaven to the
[2:00:37] others you can howl and howl and shout
[2:00:41] and Shout you will never convince
[2:00:45] them
[2:00:47] for verse 12 says for whosoever had
[2:00:53] to him shall be
[2:00:58] given and he shall have more
[2:01:02] abundance but whosoever had
[2:01:06] not from him shall be
[2:01:11] taken even that he
[2:01:15] had so that
[2:01:18] means because it's yours
[2:01:22] it will be added
[2:01:25] abundantly the one who had a little
[2:01:29] bit not knowing that it's his be taken
[2:01:32] away it's not
[2:01:34] his that is why the pastor always will
[2:01:38] say if a person has got the book
[2:01:42] entitled The revelation of the
[2:01:46] seven and he says the the seven seal is
[2:01:49] not revealed
[2:01:52] let let him bring that book
[2:01:55] back because it does not belong to him
[2:01:59] I'm sure he mentioned that many
[2:02:01] time it's not his book even if you can
[2:02:05] read it until he ache you
[2:02:10] will are we together
[2:02:13] amen therefore verse
[2:02:17] 13 speak I to them in Parables because
[2:02:24] they seeing
[2:02:28] not and hearing they hear
[2:02:32] not neither do they
[2:02:36] understand they will never reach the
[2:02:42] destination right because whatever they
[2:02:46] think they are
[2:02:48] seeing they really don't
[2:02:50] see whatever ever they think they are
[2:02:53] hearing they don't hear neither do they
[2:02:59] understand you cannot make him to
[2:03:04] understand it should be revealed
[2:03:08] unto verse 14
[2:03:12] says in them is fulfill the prophecy of
[2:03:17] Isaiah when he says by hearing shall
[2:03:26] hear and shall not understand you hear
[2:03:30] you don't understand and seeing you
[2:03:33] shall
[2:03:35] see and shall not
[2:03:39] perceive in other words they will not
[2:03:41] become
[2:03:43] aware right amen if you read also you
[2:03:47] don't have to read the Ephesians 1:9
[2:03:50] Ephesians 1:9 it's speaks
[2:03:52] about uh the good pleasure that was in
[2:03:57] God he he had a
[2:04:01] purpose and that
[2:04:04] purpose gave him a
[2:04:07] pleasure there was pleasure in that okay
[2:04:11] fine let me just uh read you a a quote
[2:04:14] where now the prophet I mean God rebuked
[2:04:19] the prophet
[2:04:23] for not moving
[2:04:26] on yeah now he says I'm I'm reading this
[2:04:31] quote
[2:04:33] here it's in this book
[2:04:37] experiences that was preached in
[2:04:42] 19477 now I'm very careful about this
[2:04:45] books that were
[2:04:48] preached uh years before
[2:04:52] how can I put
[2:04:57] it last time I preach to
[2:05:01] you I quoted a
[2:05:04] quote where now the prophet
[2:05:07] says speaking about
[2:05:10] faith and
[2:05:12] doubt so that book says it's in the
[2:05:18] spirit after service a sister call
[2:05:22] said no
[2:05:23] brother faith and doubt is in the
[2:05:28] soul in the spirit I said thank you my
[2:05:33] sister I will stand at the pull pit and
[2:05:38] rectify
[2:05:40] it you see it's good that now uh we are
[2:05:44] preaching to the
[2:05:48] people yeah if you try to mix
[2:05:54] things it's not like this yeah thank you
[2:05:57] my sister I'm sure she hears me now I'm
[2:06:00] rectifying it right now what what I'm
[2:06:05] reading
[2:06:06] here is uh this book it was preached
[2:06:11] 1947
[2:06:13] 1947
[2:06:15] uh the prophet says in this book uh it's
[2:06:19] uh experiences
[2:06:22] experiences don't forget I'm trying to
[2:06:25] show you that the
[2:06:28] prophets stood instead of going
[2:06:32] forward and then God was not happy about
[2:06:35] it because he was supposed to go
[2:06:39] forward because he was called for
[2:06:44] aose not to and and you are also called
[2:06:49] for a purose not time left right you
[2:06:53] have you have to
[2:06:55] move yeah then the prophet
[2:06:58] said you need to be a trained
[2:07:03] soldier now paragraph 10
[2:07:08] [Music]
[2:07:10] says I love to
[2:07:14] listen and I like to
[2:07:16] help that is the
[2:07:19] prophet and then everyone that to to
[2:07:23] help everyone that I
[2:07:27] can in doing
[2:07:29] so I let my nature get away from
[2:07:35] God says now if I
[2:07:38] listen and try to
[2:07:41] help I let my nature get away from God I
[2:07:44] explain
[2:07:46] that see my will of think is not always
[2:07:50] God's will of think
[2:07:56] right I'll explain that when we
[2:07:58] come then he
[2:08:01] continues yeah it's still in in in in
[2:08:05] paragraph
[2:08:06] 10 said if I don't get some kind of
[2:08:12] strength from somewhere
[2:08:15] else by this time next
[2:08:18] year there'll be somebody else
[2:08:22] doing this besides
[2:08:26] me right says I see my human strength
[2:08:33] living it's because that something in my
[2:08:36] heart reaches out for the
[2:08:41] people now a prophet is born a
[2:08:47] prophet he is born for a purpose
[2:08:52] now the prophets the Bible says he will
[2:08:56] turn the heart of the
[2:08:59] children to their
[2:09:01] fathers after
[2:09:06] he then he must
[2:09:09] restore and after
[2:09:11] restoration what look God had a purpose
[2:09:14] about
[2:09:17] him but now he came to a point where he
[2:09:19] stood still
[2:09:21] and
[2:09:22] trying to help
[2:09:25] people and feeling for the people and by
[2:09:29] doing that he was standing still I'll
[2:09:31] show you he was not moving he was
[2:09:36] concentrating on the people and
[2:09:40] forget that he is a prophet he must take
[2:09:43] the church let it move ree right
[2:09:49] amen he that's why I said I see my human
[2:09:52] strength
[2:09:54] living because he was using his own
[2:09:57] human
[2:09:59] strength because that's something in my
[2:10:02] heart reaches
[2:10:07] out uh then he continu
[2:10:12] says uh I'll show you the what I don't
[2:10:15] want to read that one
[2:10:18] amen okay he says now what I did I just
[2:10:22] bring them
[2:10:25] on because I know the strength of the
[2:10:27] power of
[2:10:30] God and how that God let me get with
[2:10:36] that uh you know what he
[2:10:40] did he said to the
[2:10:43] people in
[2:10:46] short you don't have to
[2:10:49] repent you don't have to
[2:10:53] come as you
[2:10:54] are will heal
[2:10:56] you and people came the power of God was
[2:11:00] in the
[2:11:02] prophet he prayed for them and they were
[2:11:05] healed but now he said I made a
[2:11:09] something that even Jesus Christ didn't
[2:11:14] do I'll will read you that what you call
[2:11:17] amen he say I said just bring them on
[2:11:22] because I knew the strength of the power
[2:11:24] of
[2:11:26] God and how that God let me get by with
[2:11:31] that know I do not
[2:11:34] know says I I don't know why did God let
[2:11:37] me go on with
[2:11:41] that to say to the people you don't have
[2:11:44] to have
[2:11:46] Fai come as
[2:11:48] you so now people they mobilize brother
[2:11:53] knows
[2:11:54] that we we go
[2:11:59] somewhere and then we we call
[2:12:02] people we give them food we give them
[2:12:07] clothing give them
[2:12:09] Bibles
[2:12:11] pens
[2:12:14] scri so now they don't come for the word
[2:12:17] of God some some of
[2:12:19] them they say no
[2:12:21] there's a church that gives
[2:12:25] fre I I us to car Joseph where Joseph
[2:12:29] Joseph used to care more than 50
[2:12:33] BBL once you give him that
[2:12:38] Bible so now brother brother Bram was
[2:12:43] saying to people you don't have to have
[2:12:46] faith you just come come God will heal
[2:12:49] you
[2:12:51] and then that was wrong to
[2:12:54] God and
[2:12:56] then he says now God how did God let me
[2:13:01] uh do
[2:13:04] that because I said they must
[2:13:08] come even if they don't
[2:13:11] believe but the power of God was in
[2:13:16] him are we together amen
[2:13:19] now he say says he will always be
[2:13:23] visited by the angel of the Lord that
[2:13:25] will be paragraph 11 just to save time
[2:13:28] I'm not going to read there it says now
[2:13:31] at vanala Illinois was the time of the
[2:13:34] visitation of an
[2:13:38] Angel and the next
[2:13:40] time the angel never visited
[2:13:43] him for six
[2:13:48] months now
[2:13:52] he was preaching one
[2:13:54] day preaching about
[2:13:57] balam you know that bam the prophet of
[2:14:01] the
[2:14:03] Moes who who who prayed to
[2:14:06] God that he should go and C
[2:14:09] Israel so he was preaching about himing
[2:14:13] about him and then one day he was on the
[2:14:17] room the angel of the Lord appeared
[2:14:22] and look at
[2:14:24] him and then he fell
[2:14:28] down when he fell down he screamed and
[2:14:31] fell
[2:14:32] down and people came
[2:14:36] rushing that angel just look at
[2:14:39] him the angel that used to visit
[2:14:42] him and talk to him
[2:14:45] nicely that day he came and and then he
[2:14:48] fell down
[2:14:51] right amen then he went on and the other
[2:14:55] day
[2:14:56] preaching about
[2:14:59] balam then God
[2:15:01] said you wearing the shoes of
[2:15:06] Palam when you
[2:15:08] accusing did exactly
[2:15:12] what now that that was I've got it here
[2:15:15] you go and read the book experiences
[2:15:21] then he said now in in paragraph
[2:15:25] 13 he went down there and the angel of
[2:15:28] the Lord uh met
[2:15:32] him on the way what a mistake that I
[2:15:36] made I made an
[2:15:40] assession an assession is a forceful
[2:15:48] statement assession to the people
[2:15:52] of a power of God that even the son of
[2:15:54] God never made any statement like
[2:16:03] that so when Jesus Christ was here on
[2:16:07] Earth your faith heal you your faith
[2:16:11] heal you he didn't say come without
[2:16:15] faith so he said I made a mistake I did
[2:16:19] that even
[2:16:21] the Son of God has never done that I I
[2:16:26] made a
[2:16:28] challenging let them bring
[2:16:31] people and they came and they were
[2:16:34] healed why did God let me
[2:16:41] do so the angel of the
[2:16:44] Lord was away for the whole six
[2:16:47] months when came back
[2:16:51] it was
[2:16:53] angry and then brother God revealed that
[2:16:57] now you are called to move
[2:17:02] on because if you take the BAM and
[2:17:06] Moses the basics were the
[2:17:10] same they worship the same God they
[2:17:13] speak to the same God and God answered
[2:17:17] them see if you take the ch
[2:17:23] they worship the same God they speak to
[2:17:26] God they cast the me the demons in the
[2:17:30] name of our Lord Jesus
[2:17:31] Christ the basics are the
[2:17:34] same but now what makes
[2:17:37] you
[2:17:39] differs as the bride how do you differ
[2:17:43] from the
[2:17:44] church you use the name of Jesus they
[2:17:47] use the name of Jesus they cast The
[2:17:50] Demon out
[2:17:51] will move away P they do that so your
[2:17:55] Basics are the
[2:17:57] same the same God answer
[2:18:01] them but the
[2:18:03] difference between
[2:18:05] Moses and balam Moses had the pillar of
[2:18:10] fire the
[2:18:13] difference between
[2:18:15] you
[2:18:16] and church is that you've got the pillar
[2:18:20] over
[2:18:22] the killer of fire in
[2:18:25] you is the revealed
[2:18:28] way they've got the
[2:18:30] word you've got the word but yours is
[2:18:36] rallu and then you manifest
[2:18:40] it our Lord Jesus Christ when he was
[2:18:44] here on Earth was to manifest
[2:18:48] the he didn't say I am Jesus
[2:18:51] no he just did
[2:18:54] manifest until they could
[2:18:57] say
[2:18:59] surely this is the Son of God he
[2:19:03] manifest that way now the bride is
[2:19:07] manifesting that
[2:19:09] way Basics can be the same amen if
[2:19:12] there's miracles to
[2:19:14] perform always Jesus did
[2:19:18] that uh the
[2:19:21] Prophet
[2:19:23] went to
[2:19:26] uh is quoting this this this book here
[2:19:30] this PS
[2:19:31] here the Psalm of Life P of life he said
[2:19:35] now uh the Psalm of Life in this in this
[2:19:40] Psalm the psalm was written by Long
[2:19:43] Fellow those that knows it was written
[2:19:46] by a poet
[2:19:51] he speaking about footprints on the
[2:19:54] sense of
[2:19:57] time some of you have got some of you
[2:20:00] have got that
[2:20:02] book uh Long Fellow was
[2:20:05] described was very much impressed he
[2:20:09] said that he
[2:20:12] liked it speaks
[2:20:14] about pleasure and sorrow
[2:20:21] he
[2:20:21] says
[2:20:23] pleasure or
[2:20:26] sorrow is not the goal of
[2:20:30] life in other words when God calls
[2:20:33] you he didn't call you to be
[2:20:38] sorrowful Nei did he call you for a
[2:20:41] pleasure it's not the goal of
[2:20:45] Life the purpose of life is to carry out
[2:20:50] all all duties and
[2:20:52] responsibilities for the progress of
[2:20:55] good
[2:21:00] will for the progress of good and for
[2:21:05] all you don't have to stop here and say
[2:21:09] I am
[2:21:10] sorrowful I'm not going anywhere because
[2:21:13] I am sorrowful you don't have to stop
[2:21:15] yet say ah I've good pleasure I don't
[2:21:19] move forward got what I
[2:21:21] wanted that is
[2:21:24] not the goal of
[2:21:27] life now brother speaks about
[2:21:30] himself I stopped
[2:21:33] somewhere where which was not my
[2:21:36] go right amen so now when when when when
[2:21:40] when when when he read the the the the
[2:21:43] PSAL of
[2:21:46] life then he he he came to recognize
[2:21:49] that
[2:21:51] he says now uh the the mark that the
[2:21:56] individual leaves
[2:22:01] behind each and every one of
[2:22:05] us what the footprints on the S of
[2:22:11] time speaking about your
[2:22:14] life those
[2:22:16] foodprints that you leave
[2:22:19] behind when the other
[2:22:21] people comes
[2:22:24] you they should
[2:22:27] see good things that you have
[2:22:32] done they should be able to go on your
[2:22:37] footsteps on the SS of
[2:22:41] time are we together amen so now that's
[2:22:44] what that's what he was saying though we
[2:22:47] are
[2:22:48] mortal we can live foodpre
[2:22:52] for succeeding
[2:22:56] generation here we are right now we

[2:23:09] Believer he reads what Paul did he's
[2:23:12] working on the footprints
[2:23:15] of together is working on the footprints
[2:23:18] of Moses
[2:23:21] now we
[2:23:23] ourselves we need to leave a
[2:23:28] footprint are we together amen we need
[2:23:31] we need to leave a
[2:23:33] footprint okay right now whenever we are
[2:23:36] here
[2:23:37] on most of the
[2:23:39] preachers that belong to this
[2:23:41] assembly they will call their Pastor the

[2:24:39] spies and they discovered that there
[2:24:41] were some
