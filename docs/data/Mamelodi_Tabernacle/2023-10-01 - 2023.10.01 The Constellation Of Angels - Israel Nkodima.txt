Description:
Title: The Constellation of Angels.
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 01 October 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.
The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Ephesians 1:9-10, Revelation 22:20

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the Constellation of Angels.

Our Ministry has a sign and that sign is the pyramid. The first Pyramid is of Enoch then, the second Pyramid is of Angels.

You come to God through a commission. The first commission of the prophet Brahman was to pray for the sick. When God wants to speak to a person he takes him and put him in a constellation. 

If God made you in his image you will follow and Worship Him. You come to Jesus when you see yourself in Him.  God created you in his image as he wants you to talk like him and be perfect like Him.  A True Christian wants to be like his Creator. If you are called by God you are called to eternity.

The sermons that are preached by the Son’s of God , Satan doesn’t know those sermons and he can’t Preach them also.  When you believe it means your name was in the book.  You can’t force any person to believe God. 

The battle started beyond time and it will end beyond time.

Under the new Commission of Angels, He had to go west to connect with these Angels’ Message, to come back here to reveal It to the church. 

The Pastor quotes the following spoken words:

63-0324E - The Seventh Seal par 78, 231, 260, 404-407.
62-1230E - Is This The Sign Of The End, Sir? Par 205 - 207
65-1031M - "Power Of Transformation par 57

the fullness of time comes they will supernaturally benefit amen amen hey we've been in this world for a long time amen that's why you see the book ends up with come Lord Jesus uh I was talking with my brethren but not to call names the first time I received this song from Brother ba even saw Lord Jesus come Jesus [Music] and now I put it in myell for ring right now I was talking to some of our brothers some they did put them in and then took them out quickly they took it out quick and then and others Jesus so it's a problem while he among the people then they just hear even so Jesus come I'm told that in a certain country they Bend [Music] this amen amen while they are not waiting for him they think that we are encouraging him to come okay amen now mine is there whether is in the midst of people or even so [Music] Jesus people who are in Christ that is their song you know even in the Book of Revelation H that is Revelation chapter 22 here verse 20 he which testified these things said surely I come quickly yeah now amen amen even so Jes the grace of our God our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all it was at the closing of the book amen okay yes so that's why my what you callone tells everybody of what I'm waiting for amen okay so let's look at this we are going to look at the constellation okay amen constellation of the angels and yes constellation of the Angels I'm going to read from this book is this the time is this the time say is this the time you know when God sends a prophet because the true prophet of God is the main star you know in the book of uh okay let me turn to this in the Stars you have the main stars then around each there's a cluster of stars that's why God has seven main stars in Book of Genesis they were just called stars then when the Holy Ghost came they were called Apostles amen amen so now each of this star has a clust of the people Anointed with the same Spirit in order to serve God through that stuff without that you'll miss the point you can truly worship unless you find the place of worship am all right now H I'm going to read to you about the constellation I said to brother gab gab and then we have brother memes as you have seen they are in the constellation because when the word of God comes it comes into the constellation all right amen is uh it reflects Sons and Daughters of God now here there's a pyramid of men and there's a pyramid of angels now if you look in the Bible you find that the the first pyramid of Enoch Enoch was responsible for that pyramid why you know pyramid has seven steps why because Enoch is the seventh man amen from Adam and being the seventh that's why now we have seven pyramid he was responsible for that structure the seventh man responsible for the seven the the pyramid with seven steps to the king do you still remember getting into the king's CH and I read also that the bride of Christ is made like a pyramid is God's sign amen if you can notice all the way we've been having this sign our ministry has a sign it's a pyramid pyramid now so I I I will just read this part to show the first pyramid of Enoch the seventh man from Adam and the second pyramid is of the seventh angel messenger amen it runs to the end because it's a perfect St that's why you notice if the ministry is under H the guidance of God you see that sign you you will see that sign pyramid that's why we are having it all right amen now I read this part uh there was this pyramid of Enoch then after that there's a pyramid of angels amen and you know that will come to where do you still remember the the white white stone interpretation Stone interpretation amen if there's something maybe the brother is busy with something [Music] he can just on a piece of paper tell me that there's something okay H you know we were praying you were there when something on the roof was like people running away when we prayed there then I realized that we afterwards we were told that it's the people who actually were there but when we prayed today they ran [Music] away okay all right let's look at this for a few minutes uh this pyramid of angels I'm going to read part and we looking at the as we are looking at the commission amen amen uh you come to God through a commission now there was the first commission when brother Bram was told to pray for the sick that was the first Commission now we have this now commission here which we will look at in this dispensation amen amen you know when he prayed for sister that was under a commission but that was the first one now the second one comes like this I read from uh the spoken as I was with Moses was with Moses 26 26 amen amen this is the things that keep us almost the whole uh I I told you the busiest thing now is the cell phone and it takes a huge value from the spirits of men because the state of the word I have cell phones to help me uh doing the work of the Lord but I don't worship them and if you want to see you can come to me I will give you my cell phones and you go through them but with others like we will come to light light light you know some people today before we read here God bless you sir [Music] um oh no the Lord be praised amen let me start reading here so as to uh keep time where is my all for 26 h brother I had it tonight now that book oh amen how did I misplace it here oh here we are let me read to you quickly H this is says is this the time says is this the time okay yeah no all F now it's Satan trying this but it's all fine his things has come to amen not amen I will read to you next time about the last last three and a half years and which is of and the Bible says he knows that his time short let me tell you something so that you can relax somebody was calling me and calling me so I wondered why she's calling me only to realize that Satan has set up a trap now the brother here is my witness how God revealed that okay don't fear Satan fear God now I read this is about the constellation maybe some of you will be found to be in the constellation I that starting don't worry I start here speaks the prophet I was looking W [Music] what way off into eternity the only way somebody can look into eternity it's only if he has eternal life then he can look into eternity you know if you look into eternity all the things of the world they faint [Music] out because after all you know this is not our home our home is far away Beyond time I was looking at something here uh where is our home far away Beyond time you you can't get there by Uber the only thing that can take you there is in the is back there I'm looking for something here before we preach for a few minutes there's things here to look at you know as a child of God even your mind has changed you are no longer thinking like you did before and I tell you the truth before God while walking around I to me I think of for seeing things for the last time you know there's some people today that are seeing things for the last time did you know that they are so generous pilgrims on their way the real gospel today is the one that even changed your [Music] see we are looking at things and see them different you know even your eyes [Applause] are converted that's why when you look you don't look like a an ordinary man because expect or you expecting to see amen amen you are looking but the the the the world and the things of the world they sort of cast a shadow but inside of you you want to see something because you are not of this world amen amen you are looking for something you are longing for something which is not of this world because the Bible says you are not of the world Amen you forgive me for looking for something here uh it's a piece of an envelope Perhaps it is in my back I don't know okay if somebody has access to my back it is an envelope with a writing on it right let me read now uh the prophet speaks I was looking Westward Way of into eternity you know your your your inner sight is it's not like b b binocular binoc is binoculars up to they can only see up to a point but inside of you you have a pair and your inside can see far away now you can't go to heaven if you haven't seen heaven why you follow the lord is because you've seen something no man can quit doing things of the world unless he has seen something a wi does not see heaven when he or she wakes up the only thing he thinks of is witchcraft she can just see that far waiting for the Judgment but a child of God can see far let us read the brother here was looking into [Music] eternity into eternity he says I saw a constellation of something coming it looked like a um all right there he was counting and then it says and he saw not more than seven but they were in a shape of pyramid these are angels like Messengers this Messengers coming when I did the power of almighty God lifted me up to meet them eight days have passed and I can't forget it yet I never had anything to bother me like that my family can tell you the men of God talking I could see Angels those shaped back Wings traveling faster than sound they come from eternity in h split like the twinkling of an eye not enough to uh bet your eye just twinkling they were there I didn't have have time to count I didn't have time to [Music] uh to time know more than to look mighty ones great powerful angels SN White Wings and uh they were coming at a whistling sound and which uh it continues then I was caught up into this pyramid as I say there was pyramid of Enoch the seventh angel messenger also introduced a pyramid all right now here it says H Mighty angels and when I did when he did I was caught into this pyramid of constellation and uh I was numed and I thought I'm at the end of the road I must not tell the people this I don't want them to know about it but the heavenly father has let me know that my time is finished you know the people that are blessed when their time is over we know [Music] it okay like we know our time is over we are waiting for the Rapture okay now I read here uh and these angels have come for me he thought he he he is dying then it came to me while I was in the constellation you know if God want wants to talk to somebody he puts him in a constellation amen amen so that it remain God and you amen then I'll read from here I I I could hear Joseph my son calling then I turn again I thought Lord what does this vision mean I want and then it came to me not a voice just come to me saying that is the angels of the Lord uh coming the angels of the Lord to coming to give you your my new Commission and when I thought I raised my hands and said Lord Jesus will you what will you have me what will you have me do and vision left me now he says the first commission was to pray for the sick that was the first one okay now we'll continue that is the commission given to the seventh angel [Music] messenger amen all right amen now let's take this part here uh of which we will it will help us to understand in the book here SE book I read this part okay uh the brothers a brother said brother he was somewhere they said Don't Preach deep things the people don't understand and he said they said we've got new people here now in Christ we don't have new people if you are called by God you are called to Eternity amen now let me take this part while he was looking again and while you are looking it says the Angels Came From the West sweeping forward with great terrific speed then he says they picked me up that was coming back East with the mystery of this seven series just like it said in junior Jackson's dream that the Lord let me interpret for him now on the inside of that pyramid there was a white stone that wasn't written on you know that white stone uh when they were asked to look inside they looked but there was no writing on there and it tells you that they started to live one by one some of them but some remain now these others they left because there was nothing written there then we look at some who remained looking at the because for them to remain they must have seen something that kept them there you know i' I said this time and again that I was with my brother-in-law then we were here here in town when we were looking at the DS they were H just jumping along the wall but they were looking like inside amen amen while walking around they sort of were seeing something then we decided to go near with my brother only to realize that uh is this D the wall there's water inside so these does were seeing themselves because it kept us uh guessing why these DS are looking into like seeing something down there when we arrive we realize that they were looking at themselves they could see themselves in the water as you know God made man in his own you come to Jesus when you see yourself in himen you know I will read this things time and again until then amen amen I'm going back to this again let me read it again maybe you'll remember okay this is power of transformation of transformation I repeat that's the way God did about the world he work it was in his mind he it was in his mind amen amen if you notice it come like by Evolution but it was not Evolution amen I found some boys shall I repeat it amen they were having the Readers Digest dig now I was called by my father-in saying come and help here he was standing with these four boys then when I got closer he said listen to this boys they were telling my father-in-law about Evolution that man was an ape he started being an ape then he evoluted to a man in suit and I said hey brothers do you believe God they said yes I said the Bible said God made men in his own image now you you say man was an A and what happened so they said no it is just a syllabus all right now the best thing go and buy Bibles it says uh as he was creating to bring things fish and everything amen amen then something in his own image because Christianity is something uh taking you to your own image to your image if if God make Made You In His Image then you will go after him if then because you are in His image he said let us make men in our image now here it says now God made something in his own image amen you know the people are struggling today you find them uh in this H uh screens screening they are looking for an image they want to appear they want to be seen you know with me to be seen by God is [Applause] enough not by men you know when God made Adam he made him in his image so that every time when he looks at ad amen am he saw himself our God is wonderful let us make men in our image and look at them men today instead of His Image which is Christ but he wants to see himself you get what I mean amen that's why if you look at the fourth dimension Dimension it is [Music] full because the people want to be seen they want at least to do something that's why you go to your screens you see someone also appearing just watching but a true Christian wants to be like his creator [Applause] and that one come through the cell phone MH there's a a picture my real picture the one who created Me In His Image amen so I'm not looking for any other image all right amen now the finally God made something in his image amen you see brother God wanted you to Amen to be like him to see like him talk like him to live like him so he made you in His [Applause] image men have rejected the image to worship himself the Bible says people of the last days shall be lovers of themselves they love themselves more than they would love God where are you going I will repeat to you something uh when a child is born I will repeat that then there are some predictions made we want this child to be this we want this child to be this okay hardly to hear somebody saying I want this child to be a Christian all right amen now that is when a child is born but I will repeat to you that at the same time there is an old woman and old man you hear him saying my child it's it's very close where I'm going m M you can see that there is somewhere now it says then something God made something such a mighty godage made an image he made you in his own image this is the thing that brought us to him we are His Image amen okay amen uh I don't want you to see me on what do you call social media social media social media no I don't want you to see me there uh preaching the gospel is something else the streaming but apart from that I don't want you to see me there I don't even want to see myself there because I have an imageen and that image is Christ if you bear His Image you will even think like him amen because you are in His image that's why what I want to see h H like that story show me the cross and I'll find my way home and God made something in his own image our God is real God and stopped there because I read this thing time and again trying to win some Souls that have been taken over by their own images on the on the screens and so [Music] forth they own images amen amen okay amen because he stopped there because it was up to his Perfection amen all right amen so yeah have God also wanted that when he looks at you Perfection to see Perfection amen beautiful he is the only one that is perfect now that's why he wanted you as the word says He therefore perfect as your father in Heaven am did you know that God wants you to be perfect you can't perfect yourself with anything he he is the one that is perfect if today you give your life to him he will perfect you [Applause] amen then it say it was up to his Perfection of what he wanted remember after creation of all these things he said fine now let us let us make men in our image finally after he created things and he needed his own image so that it can be God in heaven and His Image all right amen that one you don't need to buy Cosmetics or anything to perfect yourself the blood of Jesus and this blood is the way today it say so all right amen now while we are looking at this angels for what are they for new commission the new Commission we are looking at this commission commission is then when I I read something here it says uh he saw the Angels coming from the West now remember in the in Eden there's Eden and the Garden of Eden so Eden being the headquarters of God the Garden of Eden the headquarters of his son I read it like that all right amen now but this Eden was put is what because the Bible says the man he has created was put Easten now what about West because every time he speaks of east west east west all right amen now after this H the Angels Came according to Jackson's dream and brother Jackson really brother Jackson the prophet interpreted to him uh on this pyramid now on the on the inside of that pyramid there was a white stone that wasn't written on that that's the reason I had to go [Applause] west to connect with this Angel's [Music] message okay amen since there's the Angels Came the message was now like Angelic like since the the seals were open especially the seventh you know the seven [Music] closes all we will find it for you the angel the seven Clos uh if you really follow the lord in spirit and in truth I will show you something here we we we were reading it even last time H I want to relax so what I looked for I have found okay there's part here I want to read page 556 556 this seventh seal is the end the the is the end of time of all things as long as when it remains closed then the devil hallu yes if it is not open then the devil continues amen that's right that's why seven SE must be open if not Satan continues to rule until it amen amen it says the seventh seal is theend of time of all things that's it amen hold it just there now there's one part here H Satan will try to impersonate but there's one thing he cannot impersonate there'll be no mimics to this because he don't know it Satan he cannot impersonate the message that we preach because he doesn't know God was supposed to make us different we can't do a thing that Satan can also do we a Ministry amen special Ministry known only to the sons and daughters [Applause] okay amen s will try to impersonate like if I say God he also can say but he ends up right there if I say Jesus is Lord he Al and Oma Satan can also say Jesus but he can't say he is Lord he will put another type of God there Satan wants the people to worship but not to worship God that's why you have the the the world is littered with some types of gods because Satan wants the people to worship but not to worship God all right amen is then if you talk about the ministry of God it says it started Beyond Time the ministry of God started Beyond Time and the minister of Satan came after you see now I read to you this Satan will try to impersonate everything that the church will do as it says in the last days many false prophets shall come and so for amen they shall perform Miracles wonders in so much if it were possible they would deceive even the very elect but it is [Applause] impossible that's why if God has called you then you have the mind of Christ the Bible says so the mind of Christ if Christ cannot be deceived you cannot be deceived if Christ is Holy you live a holy life amen now let me read this party this is one thing he cannot impersonate there will be mimics to this but no no way for him to know the third pool amen amen but let me come back there I'm going to read something in closing here where is this ministry from now sometimes you we must check you you must yourself check if you are in the ministry of God you must check where is this ministry from they will tell you this church started in 190303 right now I don't believe but let let's check of God it started we started where it started but there is no starting point amen amen amen you know to have eternal life it means you had no starting point that's why you have eternal life because eternal life has got no roots it's God himself that is eternal life now let me read you something I want to close here uh page 534 534 you listen to something here The Book of seals what did I say 5 53 yeah all the way from Genesis the seventh SE is spoken of from the very beginning there amen amen the seventh is not a new thing you see where it started the the very beginning in Genesis the seventh seal it didn't come recently only it was revealed then let me pick up the second one uh it's 532 532 I hope so amen it says then we close those who have received the seven SE it is spoken of from the very beginning back there amen the seventh amen where where where where what did they say 532 532 yes yes 532 and then also uh that's right it says even you know why why the people don't see the Battle of you can teach it and teach and say just can't see it let me show you the reason it says the battle that started way back you know where do you see where it's coming from it's for the people who were there yonder Satan and his angels were kicked out then they came to the earth and the Battle Set again it started there it is still raging in the mind you started in heaven came down and uh and it became human battle in the mind you know you are fighting in the mind even now as I'm preaching you are saying things in the mind another part meaning the ministry started Beyond Time amen Beyond amen amen and uh I will read the last two things here before we actually will come back to preach but I say h it it will be finished Beyond Time it started Beyond time it will be finished Beyond Time amen amen that's what it is that's why uh we preach Christ and we are not debating and we preach not against any man what God puts in US calling for the predestin amen amen amen you know you can't force somebody to believe God if he believes it is because he was his name was written in the book of the LI otherwise you'll testify to him until you turn blue because if he has not heard them he will not hear now listen to this the ministry that started Beyond even the battle started be time all right amen now lastly I'll close with this then we'll come back for something uh here we are the man of God here the prophet of God speaks of the Angels today I have decided to to choose the Angy he says the the that's the reason I had to go west to connect with this Angel's message come back here to reveal it to the church amen now under thisiss commission his [Applause] angels amen now he went to connect with the Angel's message and came back to reveal it to the church amen and you that the message you are receiving is from amen because it's under the commission of the Ang amen it keeps you in a constellation amen you know and then it says H he connected with the angels M come to reveal to the church then he said the next things that will happen will be at the church all right amen now listen he connected with the yeah that angel then he continue and one angel was very notable to me and the rest of them just was seemed ordinary but this Angel was a noted angel now let's finish with this H it says now to bring them under the new commission he brought the message to the church after he connected an angel amen you see the difference under the new commission amen he connected and came back to church with the message from the angel all right all right all right now the lastly something here The notable Angel and the Angels took me let me study the angel was very notable to me the the rest of them was seemed ordinary but the angel was a noted one Ang he was to my left in the constellation in the form of pyramid you know the message must bring you to this then it says remember it was in the pyramid where the mysterious White Rock was not written on and the angels took me into that pyramid of themselves let me go back a bit that stone the white stone when they were looking inside why did some left the place if I I can say to you here look down into this pyramid and you see a white stone nothing written on you amen amen you won't remain standing but if you look at that story but you see something where somebody cannot see anything he will remain standing the people who have seen the message and the core of the message they are not toast about no they know they believed is that right Peter Pedro why did you you go with other he said where can I go amen amen because the way of eternal life he didn't say the gospel the words of eternal life not just the way it should be the way of this is the ministry I believe in when I come to the service I come for the words of eternal life right amen it says the angel no he was to my left the right amen let me finish and the angels took me into that pyramid of themselves that's the constellation the mystery of God known only to them that's why they say come in it is in the pyramid in the constellation you know now recently we understood that brother gabrielson brother gabrielson every time maybe we would ask brother to go somewhere he will realize that brother gabri has seen that then I said it is because he is in the constellation [Applause] that's why the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do no Abraham was an Insider God would not do anything without Abraham knowing God will not do anything without us knowing amen amen even this of the money rituals and so forth we see them we see them God don't hide it from us what happened this morning we have seen it what happened this morning is that right amen he said shall I hide from Abraham the thing I do no he is the god of Abraham yeah listen and now there was Messengers come to interpret the pyramid or that message of the secret seven SE which within the pyramid the angel was to my left really be the last or the seventh angel if we count them because he was on my left me looking at him towards the West coming towards the east and would be on the left side that would be the last angel notable all right and how he flew right to me amen amen now some believe that he came and knocked the prophet and and and knocked him down amen amen now that is the seventh seal how he flew right to me that is the seventh SE amen it's still a notable thing right amen we tell you something amen we
