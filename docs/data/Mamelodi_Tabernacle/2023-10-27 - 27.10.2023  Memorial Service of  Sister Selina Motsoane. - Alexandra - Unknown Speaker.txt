quickened yes amen continue ver 37 and that which thou swest thou sest not that body that shall be but bear grain it may change of wheat or of some other grain but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body All Flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of Flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of Beats amen there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the Sun and another glory of the Moon and another glory

Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit amen amen how be that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are Earth and as it is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly God bless you sir you may be seated amen amen uh now in another place he says we are waiting for the Redemption of the body there is a Redemption of the spirit and there is also Redemption of our body amen every seat God has clothed it with a body amen every seat amen now let me read this part for you first she's a sister today amen amen maybe am I without respect where she is today she is a sister amen and she will be young forever amen amen and I want to read something here that she believed church now look anything that had a [Music] beginning has an end amen all right am that's there's a gar SCP and there's a scrap amen amen amen now a man young man came to me one time very much disappointed he says to me brother says brother I was going down the road here in M now on this side of M it was a and then I was thinking do the people in M have they seen this place because we have ning home there all right but whatever home will produce a children coming because when one is born another one is old amen he was also born amen amen then this friend of mine uh I had so thoughts flooded my do M people know about this place now I said to him brother my brother there is some that I can say every time a child is born we have some predictions we want this child to be this to be that at the same time there is an old man here amen amen and uh this old man he can't go back he has run his race he can't talk like or even the ones that talk they don't talk like doctor we wish this old man can be a doctor no no there's no predictions like that [Music] amen amen you are no longer a baby all right Amen Let me give you that if you buy a new car there is a scrap amen amen if a child is born there is like here on Earth you are born in order to cross over let me read here now it says H anything that had a beginning has an end am there's no beginning without end that's why God has no beginning because he's Alpha and Omega all right amen and now when he cre the Bible says he created man in his own image do you know that that's when he say let us make men in some our image yes amen so God wanted us to be some [Music] God Amen I didn't [Music] say God wanted us to be like him to think like him this is what he planted into the Eternal Souls since God is eternal amen when he makes a man he made man to live eternally that is the god m I'm afraid to say sister because you I have no respect my correct word is Sister amen me also one day I'll pass away please after that that continue to call me brother because there's no old age there am the service there is youth service we be young forever amen amen only youth service is allowed there no grapes no hospital those things came because of sin amen amen when God has destroyed sin those things are no longer found but let me read this because anything that had a beginning has an end because anything that had a beginning is a creation but God was not created he was God all right amen now when he created he made you part of his creation let us make men in our image amen all right amen so God when he made Adam he made him in his image even now we were made in the image of God we were supposed to see one another as a minor God because God begets if really we follow the word of God we were supposed to be little gods amen not the gods that I worship no God himself is worshiped by the amen he made men in His image for that man to worship God who is in His image amen God wanted you every time you look at him you'll be looking at your own image amen God wanted it to be like that he want that when you look at that you can see yourself because God made Adam so that amen so that he himself God can see himself in Adam Amen Let us make man when he say in our image in our likeness God wanted to see himself amen amen he wanted to reflect he wanted he when he looks at Adam he wanted to see himself amen even now even though Satan has a you can see today the whole world is full of floods is full of War fire and all that and and unplanned death because of sin Jesus Christ said asked him about the signs of the end he says it will be just like the time of Noah is it not like that is it not like the time of Noah it is amen amen when you whole world is full of water taking away cars I was talking to a sister we are still blessed things that are happening in some places we haven't yet experienced them here if it happened but in a small scale look what is happening around the world and it was not so but the Lord said as it was in the days of s so shall in the end times and yes it is like so it means now it is going home time amen amen let me read I said anything that had a [Music] beginning is a [Music] creation do you know that your body and mind have been created but the spirit inside your body it has not been created the spirit was processed from God how what did God do to he was a St just standing there what did do he breath the Breath of Life his and Adam living had not done so even day Adam will remain a statue being Washed by the people amen amen but God will not make a St he made a man in his own image and now when we have tripped and the devil has has has made us to do wrong what did God do he came and put on the flesh that is like ours to come for our Redemption is to bring back to the original that's why Mama redeemed now because when he was created she was created a young [Applause] [Music] woman in heaven amen amen that's why that's why even Jesus [Applause] Christ 33 years he could not go beyond 33 years amen because amen we have an old God yes amen amen now he lived really up to3 33 years amen that's why we shall be [Applause] young amen that's why don't worship an old [Applause] God sure that that the age ends up to 33 Beyond 33 we are already taking pills amen amen now we want to go back where there's no hospital amen there's no police station St we want to go back a Christian is somebody who is going [Applause] [Music] back now your body was created but not your soul your spirit the Bible says God Spirit into the if he had not done Adam will remain a St but if breath and then Adam started speaking and he started talking all right amen now now this body is temporal that's why when you come out of this body you enter into another B now let's listen like [Music] this did you hear that anything that has a beginning has an end are you a Christian I can show you in the Bible if you are a Christian you have no beginning that's why Jesus Christ when he comes to redeem it is because he made without the beginning [Music] amen the Bible says in the Garden of Eden what God created it was just the body amen amen amen after creating Adam now now he brought in life into Adam all right amen now let me read this now okay now anything that had a beginning is a creation that's why the body was created but Bible the spirit was created but the Bible doesn't say the spirit was created he breath into the the Breath of Life That's from himself he made you part of himself when he he breath into you his own Spirit not wind all right amen and now when we F because of the Enemy being the devil that's when now the one who created our bodies took a form a body like ours and came here on Earth amen amen he says the knew him not now which the Bible says which ones knew him the world knew him not but [Music] fa we are we are thankful mothers the world he came to the world the world him not it doesn't end up there still he came to the world and the world knew him not because the world is something that started amen amen that's why the world could not recognize he has no beginning now anything that has a beginning doesn't know him brother now read that scripture again that scripture where he says almost every day read it all the time when he prayed I am not of the world am amen amen Jesus Christ when he prayed I am not now the world is not the so made the world and the we the world [Music] system he came to the world but the world knew him not and received him not it doesn't say the Earth the [Music] Isn 17 yes from verse 14 I have given them Thy word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world has hated hated them because they are not of the world okay amen I pray not that thou should take them out of the world but that thou should as keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am not of the world Amen God bless you amen all right amen now just to [Music] this we continueing all the days until until then until go on [Music] see then with Jo [Music] all the day my eyes behold the city the day God calls me home amen amen every day when you go to sleep you don't know if tomorrow you will still be there all right am that's whys seek Him seek the Lord and find him amen amen God doesn't just say he says seek Him seek the Lord and find him something I was reading something here uh if where it says okay the world before I go back to the world the and the the world is system syst world called the world but the Earth is this amen amen I think we are understand I I quote something here if then it says uh because anything that had a beginning is a creation but God was not created he was always God the time because the real man was a the that's the real man that's why right now we don't see that body but she's much alive and happy that's why com one another why because the Mama today she's the happiest person even if we were to call her back she wouldn't agree with us because where she is she is heavy amen amen she's Beyond Time because a Christian started back there Beyond Time the Bible says H we were in him before the foundation of the world Epi Ephesians yes Ephesians just listen to that Ephesians chapter 4 verse 30 yes and grief not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption amen yes continue let all bitterness and r bre and anger and drama and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake have forgiven you God bless you amen can a Christian hate please answer me no because Bible the B says he who hates his brother is like who killed his brother all right amen now you as a Christian you don't want to be like killed his brother and the Bible says he who hates is like he doesn't even uh want the conditions wants me to put conditions to say the reason I hate this brother already before I explain anything God says you are like maybe I I'm going to say I hate this brother because uh he did did this this to me also God won't listen to that he will say once you say I I hate this brother says you are [Applause] like explanation no explanation required owes will understand say no the brother owes me money and I finish here all right H you've seen here let me read this we'll continue one day the body me H what we used to to call Mama and so forth the one that we used because the Bible says we are waiting for the Redemption of our body now she has been redeemed she's now in a young body that puts us in a better place we shall young shall be young now I want to quote this when Abraham met MEC he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the Final End [Applause] every son of Abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same [Music] thing now let me quote to you with whom I am referring to whom then it says now we we see attribute sons of his Spirit have not yet entered in the word form body but a what is in you is a theop this body is subject to the [Music] we I've been how long have I been

that great day coming he says the dead in Christ shall rise now to rise what does it mean amen he's bringing them back into the bodies am that's right amen that's why he says they are not scared of the graves and the death why are they not scared of death because death is taking me home [Music] amen any vehicle there is no vehicle that can take you home amen that's why Jr he came to die for us every person who has been created the knows that Jesus Christ came to die for our [Music] Sinners so that he can give us life the life of the life amen now we are on a journey we are on a journey on in this earth amen amen rich or poor okay a body subject a before iose there's a body is called theop this body is subject believeing God others do not believe God the difference it is what is inside the person if you have eternal life when the Bible says the one who believes has eternal life it means he does not have a beginning to die for us for to redeem us no end amen amen then can I read you
