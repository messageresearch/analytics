[1:38:40] the sign is there
[1:38:42] the
[1:38:56] and
[1:38:58] we are following we are seeing these
[1:39:00] things
[1:39:03] and
[1:39:04] openly they are there
[1:39:08] the prophet has spoken
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:23] is
[1:39:38] says it will happen
[1:39:40] immediately after the rapture
[1:39:47] it has already started he said it to me
[1:39:51] all the signs
[1:40:03] let us
[1:40:05] start by reading from luke chapter 9
[1:40:19] [Music]
[1:40:21] our brother will read when he should
[1:40:23] believe
[1:40:26] luke chapter 9 verse 27 to 31
[1:40:30] but i tell you of the truth
[1:40:33] there be some standing here which shall
[1:40:35] not taste of death
[1:40:37] till they see the kingdom of god
[1:40:40] and it came to pass about an eight days
[1:40:43] after these sayings he took peter and
[1:40:46] john and james and went up into a
[1:40:49] mountain to pray
[1:40:50] and as he prayed the fashion of his
[1:40:53] countenance was altered
[1:40:55] and his remnant was white as clistering
[1:40:58] and behold this talked with him two men
[1:41:02] which were moses and elias
[1:41:04] who appeared in glory and speak of his
[1:41:07] disease
[1:41:08] which he should accomplish at jerusalem
[1:41:25] [Music]
[1:41:58] okay
[1:42:00] now we are going to read some
[1:42:03] things concerning these scriptures
[1:42:09] and
[1:42:10] you know brother branham says they were
[1:42:15] heavenly witnesses
[1:42:17] and the earthly witness is there
[1:42:23] now let us look at this earthly
[1:42:26] witnesses
[1:42:29] have heavenly witnesses
[1:42:32] and
[1:42:34] elijah moses
[1:42:36] and christ together
[1:42:39] theophanies
[1:42:54] how he will finish his work in jerusalem
[1:43:01] witnesses earthly witnesses
[1:43:11] where
[1:43:12] peter was there
[1:43:14] and
[1:43:17] john and james
[1:43:28] and he entered into one of the ships
[1:43:31] which was simon's
[1:43:32] and prayed him that he would trust
[1:43:35] out a little from the land and he sat
[1:43:38] down and tore the people out of the ship
[1:43:41] now when he had left speaking he said
[1:43:44] unto simon launched out into the deep
[1:43:47] and it led
[1:43:48] and let down your nets
[1:43:50] for a drought and simon answering said
[1:43:53] unto him
[1:43:54] master we have toiled all night all the
[1:43:57] night and have taken nothing
[1:44:00] nevertheless at thy word i will let down
[1:44:02] the net
[1:44:04] and when he had
[1:44:05] this done they enclosed a great
[1:44:08] multitude of fishes and their net break
[1:44:12] and they becomed unto their partners
[1:44:15] which were in the other ship that they
[1:44:17] should come and help them and they came
[1:44:20] and filled both the sheeps so that they
[1:44:23] began to sink
[1:44:24] when simon peter saw it he fell down at
[1:44:27] jesus knees saying
[1:44:29] depart from me for i am a sinful man o
[1:44:32] lord
[1:44:33] for he was astonished and all that
[1:44:37] were with him at the drought of the
[1:44:40] fishes which they had taken
[1:44:43] and so was also james and john the sons
[1:44:46] of zebedee which were partners with
[1:44:49] simon
[1:44:50] amen
[1:44:52] god bless you
[1:44:54] now it is very important to have these
[1:44:57] witnesses
[1:45:00] because after that
[1:45:02] we also took them up
[1:45:07] now firstly he met them at the sea
[1:45:13] lunch
[1:45:14] lunch lunch out into the
[1:45:18] dip
[1:45:21] amen
[1:45:22] now we can repeat that
[1:45:26] he is spoken
[1:45:28] after he spoken to them
[1:45:31] launched into the deep bailey
[1:45:34] all right then after that
[1:45:37] he took them up to the highest mountain
[1:46:38] they are trying to discredit the prophet
[1:46:45] else
[1:46:51] because we have already received the
[1:46:53] message
[1:46:57] it's already in us
[1:47:00] so
[1:47:01] we'll look at it
[1:47:04] how then
[1:47:05] the 144
[1:47:09] pardons we'll start here first
[1:47:12] he was speaking to them
[1:47:18] yeah
[1:47:19] what what verse is that one let's give a
[1:47:22] safe in you
[1:47:25] first
[1:47:29] verse 31
[1:47:30] yes who appeared in glory and speak of
[1:47:34] his disease which he should accomplish
[1:47:37] at jerusalem
[1:47:38] yes
[1:47:40] he had a work to accomplish
[1:47:43] at jerusalem
[1:47:47] the people whom he is going to
[1:47:49] accomplish that work
[1:47:51] with
[1:47:52] jerusalem
[1:47:57] amen now i said yesterday
[1:48:32] who will introduce christ
[1:48:35] because they rejected christ
[1:48:39] it is here in the scriptures
[1:48:41] they were blinded
[1:48:43] by foreign
[1:49:39] the blindness come comes
[1:49:53] he is veiled in a man
[1:49:57] as he always was veiled
[1:50:02] unto them
[1:50:04] was in his human temple
[1:50:08] god was
[1:51:05] a human form
[1:51:10] so now
[1:51:11] the prophet put it this way here
[1:51:15] in the greeks
[1:51:44] when he saw jesus christ
[1:52:12] so some saw a man
[1:52:48] [Applause]

[1:53:07] ages now

[1:54:21] and in the book of revelation we will
[1:54:23] quickly find that

[1:55:51] he took the book from the one that said
[1:55:54] on the right hand side
[1:56:00] people have been guessing about it that
[1:56:02] he took the book from an old man or from
[1:56:05] his father sitting
[1:56:07] right inside
[1:56:54] and
[1:57:06] jesus christ

[2:21:24] that spirit that preached jesus to the
[2:21:26] gentiles
[2:21:30] to the jews
[2:21:34] that spirit now has moved
[2:21:37] to the jews
[2:22:06] is
[2:22:20] is three and a half years of satan
[2:22:36] and the holy spirit took from the
[2:22:38] gentiles and the rapture comes for the
[2:22:41] church to be taken out i just wanted us

[2:23:27] that blinded them and they said you are
[2:23:29] a man
[2:23:44] also can teleport blinded
[2:23:48] by the same thing

[3:29:29] during the
[3:29:32] tribulation they will preach to them in
[3:29:35] the name of jesus
[3:29:38] jesus this is the thing they are
[3:29:39] rejecting even now
[3:29:59] and they will preach to the jews
[3:30:03] you know how
[3:30:05] revelation 11 says they will then they
[3:30:08] will be killed
[3:30:12] i will send my two witnesses
[3:30:20] and i will give power unto my two
[3:30:23] witnesses and they shall prophesy a
[3:30:25] thousand two hundred and three-score
[3:30:28] days
[3:30:29] clothed insect cloth
[3:30:31] these are the two olive trees and the
[3:30:34] two cantaloupe sticks standing before
[3:30:36] the god of the earth
[3:30:38] and if any man will hurt them fire
[3:30:40] proceedeth out of their mouth
[3:30:42] and devoureth their enemies and if any
[3:30:46] man will hurt them he must in this
[3:30:48] manner be killed
[3:30:50] this have power to shut heaven that it
[3:30:53] rain not in the days of their prophecy
[3:30:56] and have power over waters to tend them
[3:30:58] to blood
[3:30:59] and to smite the earth with all plagues
[3:31:02] as often as they will
[3:31:06] and when they shall have finished their
[3:31:08] testimony the beast that ascendeth out
[3:31:11] of the bottomless pit shall make war
[3:31:13] against them and shall overcome them and
[3:31:16] kill them
[3:31:17] and their dead bodies shall lie in the
[3:31:19] street of the great city which
[3:31:22] spiritualists called sodom and egypt
[3:31:24] where also our lord was crucified
[3:31:30] how it ended up there
[3:31:32] verse 9 they were taken
[3:31:36] and
[3:31:37] they of the people and kindreds and
[3:31:40] tongues and nations shall see their dead
[3:31:42] bodies three days and a half
[3:31:45] and shall not suffer their bodies their
[3:31:47] dead bodies to be put in graves
[3:31:50] and they that dwell upon the earth shall
[3:31:52] rejoice over them and make mary and
[3:31:55] shall send gift one to another because
[3:31:58] these two prophets tormented them
[3:32:00] and dwelt on the earth
[3:32:03] and after three days and a half
[3:32:06] the spirit of life from god entered into
[3:32:09] them
[3:32:10] and they stood up
[3:32:12] upon their feet
