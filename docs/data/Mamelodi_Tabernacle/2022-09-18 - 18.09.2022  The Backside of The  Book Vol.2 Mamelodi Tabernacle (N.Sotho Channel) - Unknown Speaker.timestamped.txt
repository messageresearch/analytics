[2:40:23] the prophet of God
[2:40:30] where it says let us look at past the
[2:40:34] curtain of time
[2:40:36] now amen
[2:40:40] oh man I mean

[2:40:45] to a person who who is with you in that
[2:40:50] journey to
[2:40:53] [Music]
[2:40:57] every time

[2:44:38] able to understand what we're talking
[2:44:40] about
[2:44:45] because
[2:44:57] as the book of seals says let us look a
[2:45:01] past the curtain of time
[2:45:07] oh let me say to him
[2:45:12] oh
[2:45:14] okay
[2:45:16] when you were born
[2:45:21] there were some promises and predictions
[2:45:23] made

[2:45:30] one would say
[2:45:31] I live I like I want this child to
[2:45:34] become this and this and this is
[2:45:40] and another one would say predictions
[2:45:46] foreign
[2:46:14] and the funeral that you see passing
[2:46:16] down there
[2:46:20] it came through the very same thing
[2:46:25] there were some predictions made for him
[2:46:28] or foreign
[2:46:48] amen amen while we are going down making
[2:46:52] some predictions

[2:49:32] passing on
[2:49:37] uh that's who I am
[2:49:42] and that's who you are if you believe
[2:49:50] now here is something again here
[2:49:55] the Lord willing
[2:49:58] now as the ministry after the seven
[2:50:02] Church ages
[2:50:05] the prophet then he said
[2:50:14] he said really let us look up past the
[2:50:17] curtain of time
[2:50:22] because
[2:50:23] you know I mean now this body is located
[2:50:31] I mean but there is somebody inside of
[2:50:34] this body
[2:50:38] amen amen who has eternal life
[2:50:43] that's right even Jesus
[2:50:46] his body was a captain of times
[2:50:52] that's why when he died
[2:50:58] but his soul went down
[2:51:01] [Applause]
[2:51:01] [Music]
[2:51:07] [Applause]
[2:51:09] came back again

[2:51:19] but I am now alive forever
[2:51:33] literally who
[2:51:35] amen amen
[2:51:37] and then the Soul is running
[2:51:40] and he led us through that morion
[2:51:45] and the Bible says
[2:51:48] he's the one who went
[2:51:50] down to the outermost
[2:51:55] came back to go to
[2:52:01] when God goes down he really
[2:52:04] really fast and
[2:52:08] then he goes out
[2:52:14] the whole universe
[2:52:21] some looked at him and said
[2:52:25] he's got the whole world
[2:52:32] amen okay amen so let me finish yeah
[2:52:40] now this
[2:52:42] Bible the word of God says
[2:52:47] so you have
[2:52:50] governors

[2:55:58] Elia

[2:57:13] oil what water and you buy your healing
[2:57:27] you know the healing today is
[2:57:36] not in Jesus time
[2:57:40] I mean not in Christ's time
[2:57:44] like we are in Christ's time
[2:57:49] that's why I can't sell you healing
[2:57:54] I am in Christ that I try time
[2:57:59] the opening of the seals
[2:58:03] uh the opening of the sealsuto
[2:58:08] [Music]
[2:58:10] amen
[2:58:15] the time of Christ

[2:58:23] of Christ
[2:58:31] he's not alone
[2:58:41] and the Bible says his pride has made
[2:58:46] herself ready
[2:58:49] because she knows that the husband is
[2:58:52] coming
[2:58:55] um
[2:59:10] have you heard of
[2:59:12] your coming
[2:59:19] there's no Wars rumors of wars and this
[2:59:22] is
[2:59:26] foreign

[2:59:52] [Applause]
[3:00:00] [Music]
[3:00:01] are you ready
[3:00:05] okay amen now let me read you these few
[3:00:08] things
[3:00:09] I am looking at my uh wrist watches
[3:00:14] I'm looking at my wristwatch
[3:00:17] yes I mean and the time here
[3:00:22] all right
[3:00:24] let me read to you this
[3:00:28] now really this is
[3:00:31] foreign
[3:00:35] [Applause]
[3:00:40] This Is the End
[3:00:42] of the beginning
[3:00:44] okay you have forgotten
[3:00:47] okay
[3:00:53] not the beginning of the end is
[3:00:57] you know the Lord spoke of the beginning
[3:01:20] how he brought the news to us
[3:01:26] that let us look up past the curtain of
[3:01:29] time
[3:01:31] it's now the big
[3:01:37] I will failure
[3:01:40] okay
[3:01:41] now how can you look to the
[3:01:45] uh look a past or level of faith
[3:01:50] a
[3:01:54] the curtain of time
[3:02:00] because before there was time
[3:02:05] an attribute
[3:02:15] yes I mean an attribute in God
[3:02:20] before there was time
[3:02:27] all right I mean now usually
[3:02:39] now you must look at the beginnings
[3:02:44] there's one beginning that says in the
[3:02:47] beginning was the word
[3:02:51] and there's a beginning that says
[3:02:55] in the beginning God created
[3:03:02] but some people are missing here are
[3:03:04] they still there
[3:03:06] I mean
[3:03:16] now you have two beginnings
[3:03:22] the way
[3:03:25] that beginning was the beginning of the
[3:03:28] unfolding
[3:03:33] the way it was with God the weight was
[3:03:35] God
[3:03:38] you know God is a spirit the Bible
[3:03:41] songs
[3:03:49] it says no one has seen God at any time
[3:03:56] all right amen but God
[3:03:59] started to unfold
[3:04:03] that's right since in the beginning was
[3:04:05] the word
[3:04:13] was made flesh you know that is
[3:04:19] who came the same way
[3:04:24] foreign
[3:04:37] [Music]
[3:04:57] foreign and they were attributes
[3:05:03] amen they started to unfold but um
[3:05:09] now you're you're you're
[3:05:11] the best by your mother is not your
[3:05:14] beginning
[3:05:17] it's not your beginning
[3:05:25] no I mean
[3:05:27] is the beginning of your body
[3:05:34] powerful not yourself
[3:05:37] I mean
[3:05:39] it was the body first then
[3:05:44] the breath
[3:05:49] when the child is born is just like that
[3:05:52] everyone available
[3:05:56] amen amen now then starts the unfolding
[3:06:04] you will grow hola
[3:06:10] because your body
[3:06:14] will age
[3:06:20] it was for it was born
[3:06:25] now if you are born of God in Paris
[3:06:28] that body is not this body
[3:06:33] [Music]
[3:06:35] foreign
[3:06:50] and the Bible says we will hear a man
[3:06:53] born of a woman has but few days
[3:07:00] few days
[3:07:04] that's why when you are born
[3:07:10] they already
[3:07:12] started to do some registrations
[3:07:18] they are thinking of your death
[3:07:25] now they must join there
[3:07:29] a policy of what
[3:07:31] burial what what is
[3:07:40] um
[3:07:41] I mean they know that
[3:07:45] you are born this body is Born to Die
[3:07:51] so already
[3:07:54] they prepare for your death and
[3:07:59] the time of your birth
[3:08:05] already they prepare prepare for your
[3:08:09] number
[3:08:14] that's why we celebrate death
[3:08:26] but we don't celebrate death days
[3:08:35] you
[3:08:37] you know you know let's avoids
[3:08:48] but the death day
[3:08:51] we don't celebrate
[3:08:55] okay I mean although we know that it is
[3:08:58] coming later
[3:09:01] I mean did you know that it is coming
[3:09:04] later
[3:09:07] all right
[3:09:11] it's not in our power
[3:09:17] there's this brother
[3:09:20] he came to me he said to me
[3:09:24] um
[3:09:27] you know every time
[3:09:30] I
[3:09:31] I'm going down that road
[3:09:37] foreign
[3:10:19] to go and worship
[3:10:30] his name because he's also late
[3:10:42] and I said why especially
[3:10:48] foreign
[3:11:36] foreign
[3:12:06] they will fall asleep but wait overlay
[3:12:09] okay I mean then
[3:12:21] amen amen it's things like that
[3:12:26] why because
[3:12:31] you've got to what we call mind unless
[3:12:39] that is for this body okay
[3:12:42] but inside of you there is what we call
[3:12:46] soon
[3:12:51] that is another body
[3:12:56] now listening with your soul
[3:13:01] the word of God
[3:13:06] but with your mind
[3:13:14] that's different
