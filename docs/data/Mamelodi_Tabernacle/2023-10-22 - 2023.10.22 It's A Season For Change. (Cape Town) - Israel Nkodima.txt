Description:
Title: It's a Season for Change 
Text : Go Around Seven Times.

Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima on 2023-October 22 at Cape Town.
The Pastor read the following scriptures:
I Kings 18: 41 – 46.  2 Kings 2:2  Eph 4: 30
Before God takes you he will let you know. That is why we know that were going in the rapture. Elijah knew that he was going and he started walking towards Jordan. God made you in his image, that is why the spirit in you wants to be like him. If you don't have a spirit to be like him you won't go far. The Image of our spirit is God himself.
Elisha knew that the throne of God was in Elijah. God lives in a body and the people who are predestinated can see God in a body. 
When you are born of God you have the nature of God. When you are born of God you cannot sin. The Soul of man is the throne of God. We are the followers of God in a man. 
The time of the Jews is close but the rapture must first happen. The people who are going in the rapture know it and they are already walking towards it. The rapture is potentially in the Bride and she is already changing. 
The Pastor Read the following quotations:
65-1204 The Rapture Par 105 - 106
63-0324E The Seventh Seal Par 231

and they all believe that Africans when singing they sing they or they serve god with their Inner Man and the outer man you'll never find them singing standing like that it looks like this music is even in their fingers and in their legs that's why every time they sing like that and if you are not really spiritual you can rebuke them but if you are spiritual brother mentioned King David one time says if you do not like noise don't go to heaven oh even when uh what I am saying is that I was told that Africans when they worship God they worship God with [Music] all their fingers and their I

shall we stand up for the reading of the word and our title we were looking at the title with the brother it says go again seven times go round about seven times that's again he said go again round about the walls seven times okay amen now do you have the scripture with you there you can read that in English it's First Kings chapter 18 from verse 41- 46 and Elijah said unto Ahab get the up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain so Ahab went up to eat and to drink and Elijah went up to the top of cayl and he cast himself down upon the Earth and put his face between his knees and said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there there ariseth a little Cloud out of the sea see like a man's hand and he said go up say unto Ahab prepare thy Chariot and get the down that the rain stop thee not and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and Ahab rode and went to jezrael and the Hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he GED up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of jezriel Amen I think it will be a good thing to read also in the chapter all right from verse 41 first kter 18 verse 41 for [Music] for bless you as you take your seats amen amen Okay go again go again seven times okay now we are looking at this subject here but H I will have also a text saying it's a season for change is a season for change all right H you know there's some brothers uh they blessed us there's there they blessed us with that song a season it's a season for change amen amen I think all of us here will agree that it's a season for Change and the reason he said go seven times then they H went seven times round about the also Jero but on the seventh he said go again seven times now that's why we have seven Church ages and we have seven okay let's let's talk this morning we have seven Church ages Seven Seals yes amen that me meaning that there is a second time for the bright as we will read out of this book here the first was the H seventh seven Church [Music] ages with a an the angel of the Lord or the minister for the seven Church ages but again we have another pyramid pyramid there's two pyramids us about the first pyramid and a minister the seventh angel messenger then again he speaks about another pyramid which is the Pyramid of angels amen amen down after this pyramid there is another pyramid pyramid and then now the first pyramid pyramid has ended there there this book here uh the it is called The Rapture uh I believe that the last thing we are looking for here is the rupture the bread of Christ is just waiting for rupture but how we come there's a way that God has made for us to arrive at the rupture that's why we also need to go again seven times we were reading last time about the pyramid the pyramid that this pyramid was the sign of Enoch now let's read say something about this Enoch here Enoch was the seventh man from Adam then we find this pyramid also brother also is the seventh messenger from Paul it ends up uh that way starts that way up that way so the bride has been shaped out out already of the first pyramid and now we see God introduced now another pyramid which is the Pyramid of angels and now as we are looking here page 20 of the book of The Rapture says now we find here that Enoch was the seventh from Noah from Adam which was a type of the church ages now all now all of the rest of the six men before him died amen you know here we talking about seven Church ages but we remain here as the seventh because all the others are in the six Dimension they died and so they waiting for us and but we taking it from here now Enoch was translated Enoch was raptured that is Page 20 of the book of book The rupture he was ruptured the seventh showing that is the seventh Church age that takes the rupture amen amen no I I believe that myself I know that I'm in the seventh I believe that you know yourself that you are in the or are you in another age no the seventh Church age all right amen now out of the churches and all religious movements that we have in this world God shaped out his bride Seven Ages the sign of Enoch now anything outside of that is not the bride of Christ the bright is shaped in sevenes called out of that age and out of that age together they make the bride amen amen and now I read this part here uh it types with Enoch the seventh showing that it's the seventh the church age that takes the rupture amen amen because others are asleep but the seven okay amen there's no doubt we are in the seventh Church age we all know now is the seventh is the seventh now you'll understand understand that no other person or person outside of this can be can be raptured the people that will be ruptured they are here the seventh Church age that's all outside of that you don't have another Rapture a Rapture a special Rapture for the other people okay and now that we are in the seventh Church there are things that will identify us to show that we are in the seventh the people that are in the seventh Church age if you look at them how they worship God it's not like any other people you know the children of God even when Jesus was on the earth there was difference between those who follow Jesus and other forms of worship amen amen because the seventh Church age find people that are so unique they are not like the other people a church with the anointing Anointed with the word because our time brother Bram says we are living in the time not of the Holy Ghost but of the son of men okay amen revelation of the son of man now I quote here this is H the rupture page 21 now is the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture all of the other six died but Enoch was translated because he was not found God took him amen amen as we shall not be found one day the people of this seventh Church age but Enoch raptured was a type of all the rest of them was a type now uh bear with me now now uh the rupturing without death in imp personating I hear somebody saying that the rupturing without the Bible says he W with God and he was not there are some people here know if you one of them in this age who will walk with God and shall not be found amen amen you know if God the Bible says because God was pleased with Enoch he pleased God if you can please God then God will be so glad that he will just take you away he walked with God and he was not for God took him God was soad that he took him amen amen and then we read now the rapturing calls it the rapture ing without death now rupturing we find in the Bible was Elijah and let us repeat that again you know when the time arrived I want to tell you that the people that are going in the rupture they know themselves and they know they are going in the rupture that's why now I read this part you will see this people the Rapture is already potentially brother says the Rapture already is in you is that right you don't go in the Rapture you go like Enoch he walked with God meaning potentially was already in him then he started to walk you know if you go to Elijah you realize that you'll realize that Elijah knew that he's going amen he was waiting for that Chariot to come and take you because God before he can take you he will let you know we have already received it that we are going in the rupture those that are going in the rupture have already received the message they know themselves that's why they have shun the things of the woman because they know they are going Elijah knew that he was going and he started to walk towards Jordan with that young man who was that young man Elish so followed him he knew that and because asked ask what would you want me to do for you before I'm taken and they said your spirit what I need is your spirit now if he receiv the spirit that is in Elijah he must come with a Ministry pertaining to that the same Ministry amen amen you know there was a brother in De and you know about this story he was uh with some pastors there I was told by some pastors when I arrived there they said there were there was a young man visiting here from ptor and this young man said you know brother he's trying to be brother he's trying to yeah you see and uh now I said uh that makes me happy if I can find somebody who is trying be like brother then I know that I have found Elish amen he wanted to be like Elijah amen amen so I said then I'm I'm blessed this young man looking at me he see somebody who wants to be like brother then exactly he has found the right person all of us here we are here can somebody say I don't want to be like brother all of us amen amen but I am not brother BR he's God's prophet I'm AER like El okay amen if you don't have that spirit in you to be like God then I know you won't go far in the gospel of Christ because I told the pastors God himself said let us make men in image he made you in his own is that right so now as he made you in His image was the spirit in you wants to be like him because he You In His Image all right and you are every day is that spirit in me to be like him the Lord Jesus Christ say me okay amen if your spirit if you have a spirit and you don't that spirit is not going after the image it image because the image of our spirit is God himself all right amen now that's why this book it says the sons of God will be Gods which book is that come brother I can hear you Blasphemous names Blas names Blas name says do you know that the sons of God will be Gods but we have another book adoption adoption says our inheritance is our sunship that is our inheritance the prophet of God says that the sons the sons of God will be God and amen it went around in a ccle saying says he is God amen amen and I said you see now brother Bram says the sons of God will be gods and every message believer believes this messenger what he says the sons of God will be because they were made to be God and God himself now not brother so and so himself said let us make me in our image God wants you to be like him as a son amen amen amen you know every D it's happy when he is told that your son is like you and every son is happy when he is told you are like your father amen amen how many are like God here because God said let us make men in our image so surely if you are Supernatural you are looking for that image amen amen you know a supernatural believer is somebody who wants to be like his creator that's a supernatural believer if he sends out the Holy Spirit the spirit to us his own spirit because he wants to us to be like him can that sink until somebody say Amen to that now I said to the pastors it is so wonderful if somebody can come to you and say you want I see you want to be like God I think you'll be so happy that somebody has recognized the spirit that is in you that you want to be like God so it takes you back to the Book of Genesis us make man and it says again be therefore holy as your father in Heaven is Holy if all the worshipers had that Spirit wanting just to be like God would have a big I mean not a big church butal church amen amen now we've been to we've been we were members of Lutheran Church you know their testimony always is one they say were you in Lutheran church but do you know the the testimony when you are there don't you know the testimony they say I'm just like a leaf amen amen they are always prophesying that they are a leaf they are nothing and they even say even Jesus said don't say don't call me holy yeah is their testimony okay but let's talk about those who are who were made in His image because it comes with a a a nature if you are made in the image of God then the spirit in you is to be like him you know God knows how to do things he knew about his church the bride but how he prepared you that's why he says he said let us make men our God will never come to talk to you unless he knows that he made you in His image because if you are in the image of God you can hear God when he speaks because your nature is that the divine nature like Peter says he has given us divine nature [Applause] you know no man can beat his [Music] nature that's why sometimes people come worship and worship dance and the next they go off because no man can beat his nature is that right but if you are called of God and he gives you nature and that that nature is the nature of God himself so God once he has called you he gives you his nature and a man with the nature of God cannot fall right amen now there are people that are with who have divine nature did you know that if God is Holy then he makes his church holy he is worshiped by the people of his nature is that right let me read and finish Enoch once translated because he pleased God that's why I'm saying it's a season for change the brothers s even when if I can arrive home before the rupture from here I'm still going to ask the brothers to sing me the song It's a season for change that's why you will see here that it's a season for change I know that when the Rapture comes it will start with the ruptur in faith the rapturing faith you'll be walking like Enoch the Bible says he walked with [Music] God and he was not found now let me quote the rapturing fa without death will be called out of the seventh Church age which we are now bearing record of that age and he says let's dig deep amen amen okay amen now we find in the Bible there was this man elah brother can you find us Kings there you know just in the in the Bible as brother says scripture is a revelation in the Bible uh do you find it when you know I want that part Elijah said to Elish remain here but I want us to read it remain here the Lord has sent me to Beth can you read that part second Kings chapter 2 from verse two and Elijah said unto Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to bethl and Elisha said said unto him as the Lord leaveth and as thy soul leaveth I will not leave thee so they went down to bethl okay now there was something in the follower of Elijah and you can see that in the followers of the end time Prophet they have that type of spirit in them he said t here let's read this part here it says and Elijah said unto Elisha tell here I pray the for the Lord has sent me to Beth and El said as the Lord live and as thy Soul lives I will not leave thee now El elishah or elishah he knew exactly that the Throne of God was in Elijah he couldn't go to worship anywhere because he has found the place of worship you know people today are jumping from there to there come to with eternal life do you know that if there is a spirit in you saying I must leave this church you haven't yet come to the place of worship you'll be jumping from here to there and from here to there because I read now he says now this is Elisha Elisha said unto him as the Lord [Music] live and as thy Soul because the soul is the Throne of God as the prophet taught us now he he even saw that God was on the throne in elij now that kept him following Elijah as I'm saying the people today calling brother Bram by names but it means it doesn't mean anything to us because we know where the Throne of God is this young man knew that God lives but he lives is in his throne and the throne is in Elijah so that's why he kept on following and they called him a man follower some of the people like they do today that you follow a manuh but you know that Beyond this body there is God because God lives in a body and those who are predestinated they can see God even when he is in the body that's why the Samaritan woman could recognize Jesus as she said I know that the Messiah come the first thing he knew then brother Bram says in the book future home he says now that woman she was waiting for that word to be made flesh she knew that the Messiah was coming but she was waiting for it to be made flesh and when it was made flesh then she said to the people come see is this not the Christ when she was when he he was made flesh that's right amen now that's why we we are not followers of men we are followers of God in a man Amen brother is my Prophet amen amen that's why I can't get lost uhhuh amen I don't go where the people are going I just follow the prophet of God in the ministry if you want to to enter in enter now all right you just follow the way of God preached by the prophet then you will follow like Elijah here we are and it says now Elish as the Lord lives and as thy soul I will not leave thee he's saying this to Elijah I will not leave thee as long as the Lord lives is in his throne in you I shall not leave [Applause] the then amen amen because uh a real believer follows God until he he or she can see God her soul the real man is not this flesh is the soul that's the Inner Man the Inner Man worship the inner God when a prophet comes is a man but a man predestinated can see God all right now let's look at this as the Lord live and your soul he said I shall not let me read it carefully H and he said I will not leave thee so they went down to Beth amen amen they he used to to go down but now because God has come down to him God in Elijah now and the Bible says they I wonder if you also have come to and I can say for Enoch walked with God so they walked together until Enoch was no more se he says God took him are you waiting for to be taken now if you are waiting for that so you will walk with they say working with Jesus there's a song H here we are again now this is It's a season for change elishah also just like any other young men and so forth but the day it was revealed to him it was to him a season for a change he started to walk we see that was who was this man I read here now they walk together until the Bible says they Cross Jordan Jordan Speaks of death you die to yourself in order for God to live in you when you are dead like as you see me I don't have in my mind a type of a thought that one day I will join a church because I'm already [Applause] in and since I know that I canot join God you you don't go or join God God gave birth to you your parents you didn't come from somewhere from a different life or different walk and to join a man and a woman and said you are my parents you were born by them that's why the Bible says he that is born of God cannot [Applause] sin why because the reason why he can't sin because he is born of God now if you are born of God you have the nature of your father and the Bible says you can't sin you ask the Bible the reason why this one can s because is born of God that is the answer I see the people today appearing on YouTube and because some people want to be seen by men you see everybody wants to do something and appear on YouTube and what say brother Instagram Instagram oh there's so many in the in the Instagram instram Instagram Instagram all right now his Dimensions this things is dimensions and you know about the fourth dimension now I last time I asked the brothers to bring a sister to me after service then I haven't uh I think it's last Sunday because of some circumstances I couldn't meet her a young sister all right brother what's the name of the sister that thing of your is really really maybe no better read what's the name of the sister the sister you were supposed to see after church the one who was supposed to come after church BR I don't know can you hear him yes is this the sister that we supposed to see after the church I was supposed to see her last Sunday you brought the sister because the sister she was doing something in the yes it's Yas her name is y yes what was her role in there was something she was doing something in the T okay she she had a a YouTube Channel where she was uploading some Vlogs and all that and can you hear the brother okay you know I I I've seen these things you find somebody uh coming in the in this TV we call them by names there's YouTube and what what what yes Tik Tok we watch that because we have the brother Brams also photos just got to help the people to hear the message but I see the people today uh you see next time somebody appearing also saying he's teaching the people to read the spoken word but the real Spirit behind that he or she wants to appear hey there are many today some are showing the people how to apply Vaseline they're just thinking of to do something so that she or he can appear on the T have you seen it yes and you are getting numbers of them some trying to show the people uh how to cook chicken amen just everybody wants to appear okay but the real son or daughter of God to appear in Christ myself they know even my grandchildren or tell them that you never never put me in those things well preaching is something else is preaching people don't like it but for a man to appear there will say he's teaching the people how to apply Vel but the main thing is not that the main thing he wants or she wants to [Music] appear all right but the Bible says when he shall appear shall be like him a real son and daughter of God wants to see himself or himself in Christ all right now and that number is growing in the okay amen have you ever seen me there you can what you have seen is when preaching the gospel but apart from that I'm not part of it I don't want to reflect that because Christ is our reflection all right amen okay Brothers before we close now the Lord willing this season for change it says last we were reading from the book which I don't have here with me now how brother bran saw the angels in the form of a pyramid pyramid because the pyramid that we have now it's not that pyramid pyramid of stones or where you find the seven Messengers the first pyramid types and speaks of even the the the the seven Angel Messengers but the second pyramid it says it speaks of the Angels brother saw the Angels the pyramid pyramid the Angels Came From eternity and these angels they came from eternity all right this first he says are men from the the Earthly men pyamid with this messenger seven but this one that came then he said that is the Pyramid of angels from eternity all right and what about this pyramid of angels I will tell you something here let us read something from here that is the seventh series I was just this morning looking at it just before I close uh I'm looking at this because seventh seal is the end of time of all things says the prophet did you know that the world is struggling the seal and brother Bram said it's not to the public they understand it because the seventh seal is the one that opens the seals the seals were opened by the seven seal amen am now let's come to this the seventh seal I'm trying to find something in this book and uh as I will open page 553 53 okay let me look at this 553 553 it says here it now we must remember that this seventh is the end of time of all things that is Page 553 book of that's right the things written in the seven seal book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption because brother says the day of redemption is the day the book was opened do you know where it is it is in the here in the book The Day of redemption is the day oh I hope I would read you something here listen so the Bible as the Bible says grieve not the the Holy Ghost G not the Holy Spirit how it reads how it brother G not holy spirit of God which you are sealed Ephesians chapter 4 can you hear the brother right Ephesians 4: 30 and grief not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption right sealed unto good it's not uh you know when we were still in their denominations there sometimes somebody would say to you you see that brother hey that brother was full of the Holy Ghost said and then you know along the way things happen and okay but the Lord said this Spirit shall be in you not until there's a problem no I met I was visiting it was my in-laws there were two sisters from certain denomination visiting there no it's a sister from the denomination visiting there now she was trying to explain why she was no longer going to church and was saying you know I used to follow even my pastor wherever he went I love God so much I was told one day that that very same Pastor has done this and this amen amen like you see how we have painted in the television by the people saying we are this we are that we are that and now for the people who don't love God it comes as like as a blessing like they say if can do this we What About Us okay you don't become a Christian because somebody's a Christian you you become a Christian because you are predestinated okay now I'm trying to read to you this part brother Bram speaking about the of redemption you know to redeem the prophet told you what the word means he says hold that that is in page 78 maybe if you don't find it in your book this in another it says hold that you know uh that what do you call this thing now the hold that he says hold that the word Redemption until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed read it for us brother in the Bible God bless you there Redemption Ephesians 4:3 and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are Saed unto the day of redemption no look here until the day now I quote brother until that day the book of redemption has been revealed the day of redemption says is the day the book is revealed and redeem the Redeemer comes claim his possession that is the day of redemption when the book is revealed you know the Bible says this book there was Revelation chapter 5 the one that on the throne with a book in his right hand side and the lamp came and took the book from the one that set the from the right hand side you see we come with that for brother tells us that of the angel on the right hand side even job will come with that speaks of that and that's why now we find that the the people of God are residing on the right side because when the book was given it came from the right hand side down to the angel on the right side it's so wonderful only if we can see it the hand the book was in the right hand that's why it says he after he has done the work Redemption he he set on the right hand side now I always tell the children of God that the angel which we shall come with that angel was on the right hand side so the people of God were looking at the right hand side because the book was on the right hand side and when it was given given it was given to the angel in the pyramid but on the right hand side we'll come to see that all right now to end this it says now that that is what is that title go again the seven times sorry go again seven times the title the seven times no no what is the title season of change a season amen amen it's a season for change so next time I'll ask the brothers to sing this why why I should change it is because even the pyramid has changed hallu it is now it is called now pyramid of angels so I must go around again seven times again that's why they said go round about the the city seven times and on the seventh day each day you they went round about once but he said on the but on the seventh day you go round about go it says go again seven times change to a seven times now I see here that brother Bram was changed from this pyramid pyramid and that is called the Pyramid of angels is that right okay this is just part of it the Lord willing if the Rapture don't come tonight will come with another part of this book and look at there is something here I was looking at right uh sh we let me read this one we must remember that the seventh seal is the end of time of all things amen amen that's right the things written in the seven sealed book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption what is what the Redemption stands for okay brother taugh us about this to redeem the Redeemer came to redeem that's why and there's another thing in the Bible when it speaks about the king's man how do you explain the king man what is that what's a king's man family man right family man that's a king man now brother B we you know we went through that brother taught me here of this King man when I realized that the King's Men speaks of a member of the family then I said that that wased me was the blood of the king then he spoke about the kingsman Redeemer meaning that the Lord Jesus Christ is my family [Applause] man is it is it hard to say the Lord Jesus is my family I'm not saying family in I'm talking about this kind of family he made us in his own image and that's why says when the angel Gabriel when that angel come to Mary he says the angel came with the word but the word that he gave to Mary and Mary believed that word it became blood in Mary's I made sure and read it I read it again what are you saying kman the message that Mary brought to that Gabriel brought to Mary when Mary believed that word the word became blood I said all right that means if we believe the word of God really like Mary becomes blood and it became blood in Mary so meaning that as we are Washed by the blood of the king man the word that we have received he says and that word when it is in us it is the blood of Jesus Christ because the book of ex says we are saved by the blood of God all right so you you are the bloodline people the bloodline people when it says I don't have that book here uh as I am closing I had something this morning that spoke to me that brother says everything that was created has an end you know the book brother I don't have it with me here okay everything that was created what happened to that has an [Music] in your body was created but not your soul the soul was not created okay what happened is the body the soul was processed because the the soul is part of God that's why brother says the word says the soul is the throne in a man because when God performs God is he comes to the soul for his Dwelling Place he dwells in in your soul not in your head because in your head it becomes a theology dwells in your soul then they say you are like God all right amen now I always look at these things and that's why the Prophet says everything that was created has an and then even this morning I was looking at it brother don't worry we will still read it I come with it the prophet of God says everything that was created I can prove to you yesterday has an I can prove to you that the Bible says in the beginning God created the Earth Heaven and the Earth then afterwards it says Heaven and Earth pass [Applause] away are you there God created heaven and earth and the same God said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away all right that's why if you want to be rich and go to and fr to make a lot of money already the word has said that will pass away I don't want to inherit a thing that will pass away that God told me that it will pass [Music] away I can come back to you again and say you have a new car there in the Gage and the same car you will find it in a scrapyard but if you go to the garage it is new then they even through a party at home that our son has bought a new car of 1 million so so 1 million but there script a scard there and a car of the same quality you see in theage I think if you come driving one million car and you see one in the scard I think it breaks your heart meaning that this car is coming when a child is born another one is [Applause] buried amen amen when we are celebrating the birth of a child it's a good thing yet one another one is buried it's not a celebration all right they come and go why we are sticking to the word of God is because we know that all things shall pass away you can own the whole the money collect the money it is like these people who sold their soaps and for a change to do money rituals selling their souls the world that we are living in is very funny we have people who are walking around withouts just for money that's why the Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil amen there's no liar like a person who has the Love of Money the Bible says the root of all it killed Judas and Lord Jesus said it would be better if he were not born Judas did you do you know that meaning that what will happen to him is going to happen to him so terrible it's better if Judas was not B because what he's going to go through for betraying the son of man it's a terrible thing did you see tribulation is coming will the Lord willing will see those things tribulation is coming have you seen the signs today it's just the end [Music] Finish and the bride is just waiting for the rupture the Saints in Israel you see the Saints [Applause] everywhere because the time for the Lord to go back to is to the so close and it won't happen it will only happen after the the rupture so the rupture must take place so that the Lord can go back to the Jews now the time of the Jews out already I mean the time of the Gentiles is over so the Rapture is coming the signs are there talking about it everywhere the rupture even the unbelievers because it's coming up even in the television showing the Rapture what is happening in Israel now all the signs are pointing to the rupture amen amen but the people who know better about that the of Christ because the prophet says it is already working in it is already in you and that is called the rupturing R rapturing faith meaning that already in you you are walking towards what you see amen I wondered when the Bible said Enoch walked with God and he was not and today I know what it means to walk with God amen elishah walked with Elijah he followed Elijah because the Rapture was already in Elijah he was going to be taken up in a chariot and Elijah knew it people that are going in the rupture they know it and they are working towards it they know already that they are going interrupt they don't look back now Enoch knew that when he was working with God he had the rapturing faith then he knew he was going Elijah knew that the Chariot is coming he knew that he was going and there are people here they know that they are going amen amen because brother Bram says the rupture potentially is in you the Rapture don't just come by surprise no when it is coming it will potentially be given to the bride and the bride will be prepared for a change because he the briad is changing already you know the people they have started to quit doing wrong things what what makes them to do that is that Faith rupturing Faith they know that they are [Applause] going I don't know somebody who knows that he's going he start to change while working living with the people is already changing amen he's looking up knowing that one of these days she will meet the Lord in the end I I want to stop yeah but only to continue with SE for change but one thing I'm thankful [Music] of is when brother said potentially it is in you and I believe it because I know what he meant all right amen they'll go to and fro changing positions but the bride of Christ potential is in the bride she's not confused she won't go to and through changing places and because once in Christ always in Christ I feel like this shall We Stand Up amen amen I think you'll allow us to continue next time the same message it is a season for change as we are going to get into the Pyramid of angels brother Bram says a itself is made like a pyramid did you hear him but maybe you haven't yet noticed that we still come to the white stone that was within the pyramid was the White St found that was in the pyramid amen amen so greater is he that is in you the one that is in the world Amen that's that's why we meet him in the [Music] clouds and I'm going to ask our pastor my pastor here just to close the service for [Music] us God bless you Pastor what does the song [Music] [Applause] [Music] Say [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] see [Applause] see [Music] [Applause] see [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] see amen maybe somebody here can raise his hand p is about to pray and say like that man on the cross remember [Music] me amen as we pray father Lord [Music] [Music] God us Lord there'll be tears of joy and laughter because there's no heartache on the other side so why people who are heartaches on the
