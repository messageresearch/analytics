[53:28] the prous name of our Lord and Savior
[53:31] Jesus
[53:36] Christ this is
[53:41] marriage this is the day of
[53:47] gladness we are happy to be invited in
[53:49] this marriage
[53:57] didn't invite
[54:01] me but unfortunately I'm the
[54:09] P then the past asked me to come
[54:20] in you know me I'm not a long speaker
[54:28] I'm just going to be I'm just going to
[54:32] officiate but before I
[54:36] officiate going to read two
[54:40] scriptures the first scripture is
[54:43] Matthew Chapter
[54:49] 19 Verse 1
[54:52] to8 verse 1
[55:13] okay should I
[55:16] read Matthew Chapter 19 Verse 1
[55:21] to8 and it came to pass that when Jesus
[55:24] had finished these Saints
[55:27] he departed from Galilee and came into
[55:30] the coast of Judea Beyond Jordan and
[55:33] great multitudes followed him and he
[55:36] healed them there the Pharisees also
[55:39] came unto him tempting him and saying
[55:41] unto him is it lawful for a man to put
[55:44] away his wife for every cause and he
[55:47] answered and said unto them have ye not
[55:50] read that he which made them at the
[55:53] beginning made them male and female
[55:56] and said for this cause shall a man
[55:59] leave father and mother and shall CLE to
[56:02] his wife and they Tain shall be one
[56:05] flesh wherefore there are no more Twain
[56:08] but one flesh what therefore God have
[56:10] joined together let no man put a they
[56:14] said unto him why did Moses then command
[56:17] to give a writing of divorcement and to
[56:20] put her
[56:21] away he said unto them Moses because of
[56:25] the hardness of your hearts suffered you
[56:28] to put away your wives but from the
[56:30] beginning it was not so amen amen
[56:35] Ephesians 5
[56:37] verse 30 verse 22-
[56:50] 3323 wives submit yourselves unto your
[56:54] own husbands as unto the the Lord for
[56:57] the husband is the head of the wife even
[57:00] as Christ is the head of the church and
[57:03] he is the savior of the body therefore
[57:07] as the church is subject unto Christ so
[57:10] let their wives be to their own husband
[57:13] in
[57:14] everything husbands love your wives even
[57:18] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[57:21] himself
[57:24] for that he might sent ify and cleanse
[57:27] it with the washing of Water by the word
[57:31] that he might present it to himself at
[57:34] glorious church not having sport or
[57:37] Wrangle or any such thing but that it
[57:40] should be holy and without
[57:44] blemish so ought men to love their wives
[57:47] as their own bodies he that loveth his
[57:50] wife loveth himself for no man ever had
[57:54] hated his own flesh
[57:56] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[58:00] the Lord the church for we are members
[58:03] of his body of his flesh and of his
[58:06] bones for this cause shall a man leave
[58:09] his father and mother and shall be
[58:11] joined unto his wife and they too shall
[58:15] be one flesh this is a great mystery but
[58:19] I speak concerning Christ and the church
[58:22] nevertheless let everyone of you in
[58:24] particular so love his his wife even as
[58:27] himself and the wife see that she
[58:30] reverence her
[58:49] husband don't have
[58:51] anything to them and we know you are the
[58:55] only one can come here and present
[58:57] something to them we submit ourself unto
[59:02] thy hand so that you can use me and my
[59:05] brother we pray and ask in the precious
[59:08] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[59:10] amen amen you may take your
[59:13] seat I want also to appreciate pastors
[59:17] who are
[59:20] here I'm
[59:23] really happy for their support
[59:29] I'm just going to be talk about
[59:31] something
[59:34] here um the marriage
[59:41] manual you see each and every
[59:48] manufacturer when he manufacture his
[59:55] product also produces a
[1:00:01] manual he
[1:00:03] can't let his product
[1:00:11] out before he can also have a
[1:00:17] manual when you buy that
[1:00:22] product you buy it with his manual
[1:00:29] if you buy a
[1:00:30] car you buy the car with the
[1:00:36] manual for
[1:00:38] you for your car to
[1:00:44] last you must always check the
[1:00:50] manual when you see the light on the
[1:00:54] dashboard you check the
[1:00:57] manual the manual will tell you what is
[1:01:01] that light what is the
[1:01:07] message but if you just go
[1:01:11] on even if there is a light on the
[1:01:15] dashboard you likely damage your
[1:01:20] car if you don't want to damage
[1:01:23] your look at the man
[1:01:27] and when the
[1:01:30] manufacturer produces his
[1:01:34] prod he also teaches
[1:01:38] people those who will service
[1:01:48] his there must
[1:01:51] be
[1:01:53] man men
[1:01:57] who will be taught how to
[1:02:02] service you will never take Nan to
[1:02:07] Toyota because there are men and Toyota
[1:02:11] there who were taught to
[1:02:16] toyot God is the
[1:02:21] manufacturer and is the manufacturer of
[1:02:25] marriage
[1:02:29] my Prophet said in the book invisible
[1:02:32] you
[1:02:34] know he said
[1:02:37] marriage is the old institution in the
[1:02:44] world I'm quoting from the
[1:02:48] manual because when he brought his
[1:02:53] product
[1:02:56] because marriage is
[1:03:00] his he brought also the
[1:03:04] manual and he trained
[1:03:08] me I am one of
[1:03:10] them who are train to service this
[1:03:18] product I'm one of
[1:03:23] them when you have a
[1:03:26] problem of your
[1:03:28] car take it to the service to the
[1:03:34] service because at the there are
[1:03:39] men who are
[1:03:42] trained
[1:03:45] to
[1:03:47] God now I'm going to quote his
[1:03:52] manual he said marriage
[1:03:56] is the old institution in the
[1:04:03] world
[1:04:04] marriage was performed first was
[1:04:08] performed
[1:04:10] first and instituted in the Garden of
[1:04:16] Eden I can't say anything I must call
[1:04:20] the
[1:04:21] manual because I'm
[1:04:24] trained to to
[1:04:26] check the
[1:04:28] manual if I I come with a problem in
[1:04:32] this
[1:04:35] institution in this
[1:04:37] product I check the
[1:04:39] manual that is what the manual
[1:04:44] say let's go back to
[1:04:47] Genesis because here where we
[1:04:50] Afra the Bible
[1:04:52] says this is the manual
[1:04:56] this manual
[1:04:58] says people were trying to ATT
[1:05:05] Jesus those were the
[1:05:07] Pharisees trying to tell Jesus about
[1:05:10] this
[1:05:14] product which is
[1:05:16] marriage Jesus refer them to the
[1:05:21] manual he said have you not
[1:05:26] manual that he who made them in the
[1:05:30] beginning made them man and male and
[1:05:35] female he was quoting the
[1:05:39] man I must quote where he
[1:05:43] quot where he
[1:05:45] quoted is Genesis chter
[1:05:48] 1 Genesis 1:
[1:05:51] 2626 he says
[1:05:55] God in the beginning God created man in
[1:05:59] his own
[1:06:02] [Music]
[1:06:04] image and
[1:06:08] likeness he he created male and
[1:06:13] female and called them Adam in the day
[1:06:17] they were
[1:06:21] created male and F
[1:06:25] to call
[1:06:30] them that is the
[1:06:32] man and in Genesis chapter
[1:06:36] 2
[1:06:37] says let me go another
[1:06:42] manual see what the prophet is
[1:06:46] saying what was
[1:06:51] if and
[1:06:53] Adam were the same
[1:06:56] they were called the
[1:06:59] Adam and they were
[1:07:02] Spirit when he formed
[1:07:05] man the first
[1:07:07] time he made him in his own
[1:07:11] image and God is a
[1:07:15] spirit in the image of
[1:07:19] God created
[1:07:22] him male and female
[1:07:27] created he
[1:07:30] them and them still there was no men to
[1:07:34] te the
[1:07:38] soil then God formed
[1:07:42] Men Out of the Dust of the
[1:07:46] earth and put and put this Jew
[1:07:53] Spirit into him
[1:07:56] and that was the first
[1:08:01] Adam in other words according to the
[1:08:06] manual a man
[1:08:09] alone
[1:08:11] man alone is not the image of
[1:08:16] God it's not a complete image of
[1:08:20] God because the
[1:08:23] manual in the beginning
[1:08:26] he created them male and
[1:08:31] female then when he when a man is
[1:08:35] alone is not the
[1:08:39] complete there must be
[1:08:43] someone the
[1:08:45] female that's why Paul when
[1:08:48] come he said marriage is
[1:08:53] Honorable and it must must be kept it
[1:08:57] must be
[1:09:00] honored B must not be
[1:09:06] defiled marriage is
[1:09:11] Honorable he formed
[1:09:15] man in the from the dust of the
[1:09:19] ground he put his Creation in into his
[1:09:23] formation
[1:09:28] and Adam was
[1:09:33] lonely because one part of him was still
[1:09:40] invisible and God said it is not
[1:09:45] good when a man is
[1:09:48] alone because he's not
[1:09:50] complete then I must made him a helm
[1:09:56] in other words this
[1:09:59] manufacturer he
[1:10:01] said this is not
[1:10:03] complete I must bring another
[1:10:06] P so that this thing must be
[1:10:10] compl then he he he he he put men to a
[1:10:14] deep
[1:10:17] sleep and out of and he took one of his
[1:10:22] R and made for him a woman
[1:10:27] and he made him to wake
[1:10:29] up when he wake up it was revealed to
[1:10:32] this
[1:10:34] man that this is part of
[1:10:37] him he was not
[1:10:39] told that this is part of
[1:10:42] you but it was revealed to
[1:10:46] him man and his
[1:10:50] wife and what were one
[1:10:55] when man and his
[1:10:58] wife and God were
[1:11:02] one why were they
[1:11:05] one because they both have the
[1:11:09] nature the nature of
[1:11:12] God that nature of God made them to be
[1:11:15] one with
[1:11:18] God because they were in his
[1:11:22] mind they came from the mind of the
[1:11:28] manufacturer before the manufacturer can
[1:11:30] manufacture the
[1:11:33] product he had to have the product in
[1:11:36] his
[1:11:38] mind and he must brought that product
[1:11:41] into the
[1:11:44] invisible he must bring it to the
[1:11:49] manifestation then God brought his
[1:11:52] thought down here
[1:11:55] it was male and
[1:11:58] female they have got the the nature of
[1:12:01] God
[1:12:03] in that nature make them to be one with
[1:12:10] God then when when Jesus was moving here
[1:12:13] on
[1:12:14] Earth his wife was in
[1:12:17] him and God put him to a deep
[1:12:21] sleep on Calvary Day
[1:12:25] that he could take his his wife out of
[1:12:29] him and he took him out and during seven
[1:12:33] Church
[1:12:34] ages God was building his
[1:12:38] wife he was bringing his wife to
[1:12:43] visibility and at the end of the seven
[1:12:48] churchurch because the Bible says man is
[1:12:51] the head of the
[1:12:53] woman then end of the seven Church
[1:12:58] age where the head came
[1:13:02] down that's why Jesus brought the head
[1:13:05] of the
[1:13:08] body at the end of the seven Church
[1:13:11] age there was a man
[1:13:15] there who brought this
[1:13:19] headship because in R chapter
[1:13:22] 10 we see a the the great
[1:13:26] angel coming down with the open
[1:13:31] door where did this get this
[1:13:35] book he took it from 5
[1:13:38] there because there was someone sitting
[1:13:41] on the
[1:13:44] throne
[1:13:46] because after the
[1:13:49] manufacturer after the
[1:13:53] manufactur manufactur the his product of
[1:13:57] marri it fell
[1:14:02] down because it was
[1:14:05] his he took
[1:14:08] it so that he can make create a
[1:14:14] fresh when it has been
[1:14:17] broken we come to this scripture
[1:14:20] here where we see Moses
[1:14:25] to service this
[1:14:29] prod but it was not according to them
[1:14:37] manufacturer that's why when the
[1:14:38] manufacturer
[1:14:41] came he referred these
[1:14:45] people to the
[1:14:48] manual after the
[1:14:51] fall this product marriage
[1:14:55] become a
[1:15:02] monster
[1:15:04] before you can get to this
[1:15:09] product you must go back to be one with
[1:15:13] the
[1:15:17] manufacturer because we have
[1:15:20] fallen when this product fell
[1:15:27] back he said I must have
[1:15:30] this I must restore
[1:15:36] it when he restored
[1:15:39] it when he was studing to restore
[1:15:42] it but let me say
[1:15:44] this before a young
[1:15:48] man and a young
[1:15:50] woman before they can be married
[1:15:55] because this product has
[1:15:58] fallen now it it is a
[1:16:03] monster because men and women
[1:16:07] Fallen then before one can
[1:16:11] marry they must be
[1:16:15] connected they must be connected to
[1:16:17] their
[1:16:19] manufactur before before they can think
[1:16:22] about
[1:16:25] they must go back be
[1:16:28] connected and connected with their
[1:16:32] manufactur otherwise if they try to
[1:16:36] marry when they are not
[1:16:38] connected because after after the fall
[1:16:41] of a
[1:16:42] man men become
[1:16:47] animal then an animal cannot
[1:16:52] marry if you marry in that
[1:16:57] position you see we have got our
[1:17:00] children who are born out of
[1:17:03] us they found us
[1:17:07] praying they joined us in
[1:17:11] prayer they seem as if they also have
[1:17:15] have received what you have
[1:17:18] received but in fact they've received
[1:17:21] nothing there because by birth
[1:17:25] you are born a
[1:17:27] sinner and you are shaped in
[1:17:30] iniquity and coming to the wor speaking
[1:17:32] Al
[1:17:33] Li it doesn't matter whether you are the
[1:17:36] daughter or the the daughter or the son
[1:17:42] of or the son or the daughter
[1:17:46] of but you are born a
[1:17:50] sinner sh
[1:17:52] iniquity coming to the W speak
[1:17:56] you come to the well being an
[1:18:00] animal and having a a nature of an
[1:18:04] animal even you are more you are better
[1:18:07] than an
[1:18:10] animal animal even is better than
[1:18:15] you an animal does not fight with his f
[1:18:26] the animal is
[1:18:28] better than this Fallen
[1:18:34] generation unless
[1:18:36] you unless you go
[1:18:39] back and be connected with the
[1:18:44] Creator you must not
[1:18:47] marry if you
[1:18:49] marry if you are not
[1:18:52] connected with your creator
[1:18:54] [Applause]
[1:18:56] that marriage will be hell on
[1:19:04] Earth no one will ever be able to sa his
[1:19:16] SE a
[1:19:18] girl must come back to the manufacturer
[1:19:26] and be
[1:19:30] connected the master
[1:19:33] here he said to
[1:19:35] them because of the hardness of your
[1:19:41] heart Moses allowed you to
[1:19:45] divorce he gave you divorce
[1:19:52] letters because this product of
[1:19:57] has
[1:19:59] fallen when the government
[1:20:01] came it said no I will build a house
[1:20:06] here this will be married
[1:20:10] house a married
[1:20:14] house they trained men
[1:20:17] there to stand to sit in that
[1:20:21] house when people get there they found
[1:20:25] men and women
[1:20:27] there called marriage
[1:20:32] officers trying to
[1:20:34] marry because the
[1:20:37] product has turned into a
[1:20:40] monster and they can't they can't do
[1:20:44] otherwise they said there is another
[1:20:47] house
[1:20:48] there after you have mared
[1:20:52] Mar you go in that one
[1:20:56] to
[1:20:59] divorce because the one who is marrying
[1:21:02] you
[1:21:03] here he has already
[1:21:08] dived he is Maring
[1:21:11] you being being already a divorced
[1:21:17] man they try they try to educate
[1:21:21] people to make them marriage counselors
[1:21:26] and they are the the worst
[1:21:29] people because they have married twice
[1:21:31] or
[1:21:33] thce but they are marriage
[1:21:36] C marriage belongs to
[1:21:40] God Amen he is the only manufacturer of
[1:21:46] marriage and he made me to be the
[1:21:48] marriage
[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:53] officer I not
[1:21:59] [Applause]
[1:22:04] and I won't be
[1:22:15] one when you get in that
[1:22:19] house when when people come to
[1:22:22] marriage they meet some getting
[1:22:28] out some are trying some are trying to
[1:22:30] get
[1:22:36] in what is the problem Jesus said is
[1:22:40] because of the hardness
[1:22:44] of they have not
[1:22:47] connected there is no Oneness in
[1:22:51] marriage without God
[1:22:55] amen the Oneness in marriage must be
[1:22:58] brought by God
[1:23:02] there because if you are back to
[1:23:05] God you are the child you are man of
[1:23:13] oath and your yes is
[1:23:18] yes and your no is
[1:23:21] no because you have received the way of
[1:23:27] oath you are oath
[1:23:32] yourself I'm going to let this to take
[1:23:35] an
[1:23:39] oath in fact when you let the two to
[1:23:42] take an
[1:23:45] oath you are just saying them to stay
[1:23:49] where they are
[1:23:52] already because there are people people
[1:23:54] of
[1:23:56] O if if they are connected with
[1:24:05] theallu after the
[1:24:08] marriage God tried
[1:24:12] to restore the
[1:24:16] family his
[1:24:19] family he took the
[1:24:23] marriage held

[1:24:57] Mystery then it was there was an
[1:25:01] answer that the L the
[1:25:04] lion has
[1:25:07] conquered but when John
[1:25:10] look he saw the
[1:25:14] lamb taking the
[1:25:17] book and when John was looking looking
[1:25:20] after
[1:25:22] d he saw the lamp opening the
[1:25:27] book and coming down with the
[1:25:31] book and when John was
[1:25:33] looking because it was
[1:25:37] said it it took the book from the one
[1:25:41] sitting on the
[1:25:45] throne and he went to his own
[1:25:50] Throne because he want to R R the secret
[1:25:55] of the
[1:25:59] book inside his own
[1:26:03] Throne he must sit inside his own
[1:26:09] thr when he was inside his own
[1:26:13] Throne he will reveal the Mysteries
[1:26:15] inside
[1:26:17] [Applause]
[1:26:18] that when he come down in
[1:26:21] the there was a man there
[1:26:25] because that man is the one who brought
[1:26:28] the
[1:26:31] headstone to the church because he Jesus
[1:26:35] said I'm going to build my
[1:26:38] church I'm going to build my
[1:26:44] wife at the end of the seven Church
[1:26:49] ages this
[1:26:51] man received the book
[1:26:54] when he received that
[1:26:56] book he received in a form of a
[1:27:02] s that that was
[1:27:05] saying we have reached the
[1:27:08] gate then we now the the man and the
[1:27:12] woman were
[1:27:16] restored those who have
[1:27:18] fallen they are being restored
[1:27:21] now they can go back
[1:27:24] hand to
[1:27:25] hand back to the
[1:27:30] garden with with the book with the S now
[1:27:36] the S is taking us
[1:27:42] back all right let's let's come
[1:27:45] here before you can think about
[1:27:49] marriage I said you must be connected
[1:27:54] connected with your
[1:27:56] maker he said here because of the
[1:27:59] hardness of your
[1:28:02] heart but eel
[1:28:04] said before God can come back into his
[1:28:10] place in the human
[1:28:12] heart he must take that one
[1:28:18] of and give
[1:28:20] man the heart of Flesh
[1:28:24] and in that heart of
[1:28:26] Flesh because in that
[1:28:29] man who has got a stone
[1:28:33] heart there is the spirit of nature
[1:28:40] there then God said I must take this
[1:28:46] Stone take this old
[1:28:50] nature and give you another spirit
[1:28:55] then after I give you another
[1:28:58] spirit I will put my
[1:29:01] spirit because you have
[1:29:03] fallen you are fallen in
[1:29:06] TS even your heart is a stone
[1:29:10] heart cannot come nearer to that kind of
[1:29:16] heart kind of heart cannot listen to the
[1:29:19] word of
[1:29:20] God God must take that heart first
[1:29:25] and give you a soft
[1:29:27] heart the heart which can at least be
[1:29:30] able to
[1:29:32] [Music]
[1:29:33] listen after
[1:29:36] listening then God will put a new
[1:29:40] hard he put a new spirit there then
[1:29:44] after putting a new spirit he will put
[1:29:47] his
[1:29:51] spirit amen when when when this product
[1:29:54] has become like
[1:29:57] that then it is now connected
[1:30:01] back with God that's why Jesus said he
[1:30:06] who made them in the
[1:30:08] beginning made them male
[1:30:12] and and he said no
[1:30:15] one should separate
[1:30:18] the the one God has put
[1:30:22] together no one should put
[1:30:28] those put
[1:30:31] together if you
[1:30:33] marry under this
[1:30:36] condition the condition of being brought
[1:30:41] back if the man is brought back and is
[1:30:45] connected with his
[1:30:47] makeup the woman is brought
[1:30:50] back the
[1:30:52] maker then the man
[1:30:55] God can wake up the
[1:30:56] man and when the man wake up when he
[1:31:00] look he will see
[1:31:03] one like
[1:31:05] him he will say this is the bone of my
[1:31:10] bone because God will open his
[1:31:15] eyes so that he could see the
[1:31:18] one who was with him in the
[1:31:22] begin because of
[1:31:24] sin this
[1:31:27] man was born at his
[1:31:31] house and his
[1:31:33] family because of sin this woman is born
[1:31:39] G but when when they receive the
[1:31:44] way because before they can receive the
[1:31:47] way there must be a man like
[1:31:53] [Applause]
[1:31:57] who will teach
[1:31:59] them how to
[1:32:02] serve
[1:32:06] because how to
[1:32:09] serve the
[1:32:13] power because he served he he served the
[1:32:18] power the power which
[1:32:21] carried to her master
[1:32:28] you should have
[1:32:31] served the
[1:32:34] power and that power will take you to
[1:32:38] your
[1:32:42] master let us say
[1:32:45] this
[1:32:47] marriage is from
[1:32:50] God a man in this
[1:32:56] situation is a
[1:33:00] driver of this
[1:33:03] prodct he must always check
[1:33:10] the when he see something
[1:33:13] that he must go to the service
[1:33:18] man so that they can check the
[1:33:22] manual what is
[1:33:25] If he if he can go on like
[1:33:30] that with the
[1:33:32] light it
[1:33:35] means this gu is not
[1:33:41] J because if this car is
[1:33:44] yours will never go
[1:33:47] on you will never go
[1:33:50] on with
[1:33:54] if there is a problem in the
[1:33:57] marriage there is something you don't
[1:34:01] understand go to the marriage
[1:34:05] officer so that you can so that you can
[1:34:08] check the
[1:34:11] manual because the here we have
[1:34:15] read the Bible say wives submit yourself
[1:34:21] unto your own husband
[1:34:27] wives you see the wife who is connected
[1:34:30] with this
[1:34:34] makup this thing is his foot is her
[1:34:38] [Music]
[1:34:42] foot now a
[1:34:45] woman is not meant to have Anon
[1:34:49] disposition
[1:34:54] she is according to the Holy
[1:34:57] Spirit to be submissive to the
[1:35:04] m this woman I'm talking about here is
[1:35:08] the one who is connected
[1:35:13] back he supposed to be submissive to the
[1:35:18] m that is commanded of
[1:35:23] woman who is truly a
[1:35:27] female all
[1:35:30] female will be of that
[1:35:34] disposition but
[1:35:38] not no real male makes a female a
[1:35:46] d I'm good in the
[1:35:50] man but she will want to be under
[1:35:56] Authority if she is connected
[1:35:59] back she will want to
[1:36:02] be to be under
[1:36:05] author if she is brought
[1:36:09] back that is the
[1:36:13] manual
[1:36:15] for but she will want to be under
[1:36:21] Authority not the rule over
[1:36:32] the the one who is
[1:36:35] connected she will this the Bible says
[1:36:40] women submit
[1:36:44] yourself
[1:36:48] the if this manual is this manual is
[1:36:52] direct to the those who are
[1:36:57] connected but those are not
[1:36:59] connected this manual is
[1:37:02] not they want equality with
[1:37:09] me because they
[1:37:12] Fallen
[1:37:15] Fallen they don't know who they
[1:37:17] are they are
[1:37:20] male fale
[1:37:25] they don't know their
[1:37:27] position a fallen somebody doesn't know
[1:37:34] his a fallen man doesn't know whether he
[1:37:39] is a
[1:37:42] man or a
[1:37:44] woman she's always afraid
[1:37:56] she will want to be under
[1:38:00] Authority not to rule over the
[1:38:03] M for he is the head for he is the head
[1:38:07] of the
[1:38:09] house if she breaks that
[1:38:13] image that God made for
[1:38:16] her she is perverted
[1:38:28] any male that let the
[1:38:32] woman to take
[1:38:35] authority has also broken that
[1:38:40] image he is
[1:38:46] perverted when you come to the
