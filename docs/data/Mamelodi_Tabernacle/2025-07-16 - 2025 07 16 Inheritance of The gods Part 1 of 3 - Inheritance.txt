TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] God bless you. H if we may turn to our Bibles again starting from the book of Genesis chapter 1 verse 26- 27. Let's just offer a prayer. We are here again together in this place this morning knowing no one but you. We commit all the souls that are under this roof unto your hands knowing that you are here to bless us. For the word says where two or three are gathered together, you are in the midst. &gt;&gt; So we believe that we can feel your presence &gt;&gt; that you are with us this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We looked around this morning for a place where we can go for to worship. And we have realized that this is the place as we open the book in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Let's turn to Genesis 1 verse 26- 27. We just want to look at this um a subject inheritance of of the gods &gt;&gt; and we'll take a text a super race all from all by the end time messenger. Amen. &gt;&gt; A man who contained all the mysteries, the seventh angel messenger. &gt;&gt; And now we are the seventh church age. But then now we are beyond the church ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Standing just before the king's chamber and the prophet says, "You come to the chimps king's chamber, one standing there to introduce you to the king." Amen. Amen. Now I believe that we we have reached the place Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the Lord today is no longer the way to us. &gt;&gt; We have now reached the place and God has reached his place that is the third place the soul of man. So the prophet says that's that's where he is today. Not in heaven but in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; H So um now if we can realize who we are, we will leave this place with a rapturing blessing. If we can realize who we are, whether it is intori. [Music] Amen. I think we should thank the Lord and give him honor for what we are, who we are. Just like brother Brenham, how we would run around a tree in the bush just by thinking about God and what he made him to be. And one time he was looking at an eagle and eagle landed there. Amen. And it was just taking steps. Brother was looking at that and he says he heard something also another animal calling out somewhere. And he started to cry like a baby because of the presence of the Lord. Seeing an eagle made him to cry. Amen. Oh, Matthew I mean Genesis 1 verse 26- 27. Genesis 1 verse 26- 27. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, if you could use the mic, please. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the kettle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image. In the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. and first John 3 verse 1 2 3 Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the children of God. Therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. God bless you. U now in the Bible we realize that God made man in his own image and uh let me turn to this book again. Blasphemous names or rather Another book, &gt;&gt; the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; God made men in his &gt;&gt; image. Then I'll take you back to the book again. &gt;&gt; As God began to work upon creeping things, page 10 of this masterpiece and uh little animals on earth. Then he began to bring it from the from that into something else higher. And man was already there in the spirit form. &gt;&gt; So God created things for his sons, the garden of Eden headquarters. Then finally he brought it into the larger animals such as lions, tiger and he brought it into the life of monkeys and so forth. Not an evolution as we think. That was complete creation. God working on a pattern. &gt;&gt; But finally there came from forth upon the earth a perfection &gt;&gt; and that was a man. &gt;&gt; So that means God's perfection is amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is perfected in a man. Father, Son, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost is God in a man. That is the a three-fold revelation of God. Finally, there came forth upon the earth what God calls perfection. And that was a man. So you must always remember that perfection is a man. God is perfected in three, father, son, and holy ghost. That holy ghost speaks of God in three. So that's why it's perfected in three. That's why the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; we have realized that the seventh seal is a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is completed in a man. The Bible also says we are complete in him. And God is complete in a man. That's why he says at that day you shall know that I am in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh even the third pool souls in prison tells me that pool was that man who came to Abraham. The third pool is a man. Seven is a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you can follow God and you don't come to where it is a man or to where he is a man, then you must know that You were deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in the garden of Eden, &gt;&gt; uh the only visible form there was Adam. For God is a spirit. We could not see God. We could see Adam. Amen. That image of God &gt;&gt; for now uh finally there came upon the earth a perfection. Now this perfection was a man. Then God could see in that man that looked like. Now let's repeat it again. As we have said, man is God's mirror. [Music] &gt;&gt; When he looked at that man, he saw himself being God. Being God, he created a God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet is going to address us. &gt;&gt; He's just going to tell us who we are. &gt;&gt; God created or made another God. So, Adam was another God under God. Then that's why now he was engaged in this contract. The prophet says &gt;&gt; Adam was the other. The other part of the contract for God created things. And the Bible tells us he brought them to Adam to see what he would call them because Adam was the other side of the continent. So God being the God of the universe and much God. Amen. And now the the network was between God and his son. We repeat these things for a while. When he look at that looks so much like him. So now when he looked upon him upon this man, he was a reflection of what his creator was. So that's why we are blessed. &gt;&gt; He said blessed &gt;&gt; is your eye to see these things and your ears to hear these things. How that God the Almighty made you in his own image. You small God under God. &gt;&gt; That means you can only deal with another God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In looking for a partner, he had to find somebody with the qualities of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was looking for a perfect partner. That partner was supposed to qualify to God. That's why even today people God can deal with. Is that so? Pastor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only people God can engage in a contract with is another God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why he made sure that this man in his own image so that man can be what he is. All right. It looked like him. That's why the prophet says when the bride at the end time &gt;&gt; will still come to that. &gt;&gt; He says the bride &gt;&gt; will be so much like him. You will find one in this place, one in Mosul Bay, one in you realize that it's the same. [Music] Amen. He said they will be so much like him. They will be even in his own image. He will come to to connect to the other to the gods his sons. Now Luke chapter 3 tells you that Adam the son not a son &gt;&gt; the son of God Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when he lost the title, God had to intervene to make a a plan of redemption in order to close that gap because he missed his partner so dearly. He had to die, his partner back again in life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was God's &gt;&gt; struggling. God was struggling to bring back this minor God in line. [Music] The cross means that &gt;&gt; the resurrection means that &gt;&gt; why he came for that. &gt;&gt; The prophet says he can only redeem the redeemable. Amen. Amen. because that is his own part, his own image. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because through this partner, &gt;&gt; he could do things. That's why the seventh messenger is that restoration. And you know, traveling back again &gt;&gt; after Adam fell, &gt;&gt; God drove them out of the garden through the east gate. Now you know Adam was pleased eastward. And the Bible says the Lord is coming from the So Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what was this garden of Eden? &gt;&gt; You know what was the garden of Eden? Uh let's check here &gt;&gt; at this garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; The prophet says &gt;&gt; I will start it from here. Now the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. That is in the book of Genesis because the prophet says why the spirit was upon the waters and the earth was void form covered in water. So the prophet says the seeds were already there. That's why now the spirit in the form of a rainbow the waters because there were seeds. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you see the rain a rainbow token, &gt;&gt; you know that beneath that the seeds, &gt;&gt; if you see a church with a rainbow, that below that there's God's token of the covenant [Music] showing that God's people. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh it says &gt;&gt; the power of transformation page eight. The world was in darkness, in chaos. What a horrible shape it must have been in. But way into the darkness yonder, without light or anything. And the churning of the water and that wandering star twisted around. in the orbits out there somewhere. &gt;&gt; It must have been a terrific mass of something else like it couldn't find its way. And that's what we become when we became wandering stars, away from God, without hope, without God. Amen. In darkness, and God took that great chaos of darkness, put it into a garden of Eden. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like he took that prostitute &gt;&gt; and transform her into Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Transform the Garden of Eden by God's word. Let there be light. mass of creation out there come over around the sun and began to revolve around the sun and became a garden of Eden because it obeyed the word of God. The garden of Eden was there as a believer. It obeyed the word of God. We have just seen the tabernacle behind the pastor's house. A place had obeyed the word of God. And now it it can accommodate the people who obeyed the word of God. That means if you obey the word of God, God will place you in a place, the same place that obeyed the word of God, the holy ground. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Moses obeyed God, God made the ground holy. Amen. Then he took that chaos. Isn't he wonderful? He can take a drunkard, a prostitute, a weak person, transform him or her into a wonderful being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, do you believe that? It became a garden of Eden because it obeyed &gt;&gt; the word of God. &gt;&gt; It done the perfect will of God for it was transformed. and everything or everything that was transformed by God obeyed the word of God. Whether it's a garden, whether it's a plant, whether it's marine life, everything transformed, obeyed the word of God, whether it's a tabernacle. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A house transformed in the in a tabernacle. &gt;&gt; For that house of the pastor obeyed the way and the obedience shall come and worship in them. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it done the perfect will of God for it was transformed from chaos into a garden of Eden by the word of God. now. That's what we are here for. That's my me my message as being all along the word of God. So, we must hold to that regardless of what other things take place. Always stay with that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Always check out your motives, &gt;&gt; objectives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay always with Joshua said to them, "Stay in the middle of the road, &gt;&gt; with the ark. [Music] &gt;&gt; Don't look to the right. Don't look the word. The word will see you through. [Music] &gt;&gt; Always check out your motives and if it's according to the word of God, amen. &gt;&gt; Then he says, &gt;&gt; now we are going to get to this Amen. &gt;&gt; Now this garden. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now you still can hear us. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we find out that after he had he had it kind it was all put by the word of God. the creator. We find that this all headed up in a headquarters. When God created grass, trees, and so forth, it was for man. &gt;&gt; God wanted to make a place for his son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he started by creating things &gt;&gt; to make that garden of Eden a place for his son. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it all we'll find out that this all headed in a headquarters called the garden of Eden. And God put his son his son bright over it all &gt;&gt; because he said subdue it rule over it. Now this great creation he had a reason for it. He made everything everything so pretty. He made the flowers in the life and the base and there was no death, no sin, no sorrow, no sickness. And then all this great thing headed up into the big headquarters which was the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; And there he put his son in this headquarters. [Music] Brother Brenam says &gt;&gt; Eden was God's headquarters. &gt;&gt; The Garden of Eden, &gt;&gt; the Garden of Eden, his son's headquarters. So they both owned head headquarters. God had his headquarters, his son, his headquarters. [Music] &gt;&gt; Can one say amen to God? Amen. Amen. So the system was from the headquarters today. Amen. not not to something under power. &gt;&gt; That's when we can see our equality with God. Then he would create a thing. Then he will take it to Adam to see what Adam would call and whatever Adam said, "Amen in God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God entrusted &gt;&gt; the kingship. Amen. He made him a God. So whatever Adam said, amen with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he brought the seventh angel messenger. and trusted him with all the mysteries. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then &gt;&gt; he brought the seven church ages &gt;&gt; and the messengers to the seventh angel messenger. And the seventh angel messenger, God just put it before him to see what he would do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he took a board and said, "This is the first church age." Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; And Paul is the first messenger. And God said, "Amen with fire." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The same thing. &gt;&gt; God answered &gt;&gt; with fire &gt;&gt; and confirmed what brother Brennan grew. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. like he did with Elijah. &gt;&gt; He confirmed &gt;&gt; the sacrifice with fire and I believe that God still going to confirm. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know I have said h just previous week of God. How Moses he cast down his rod and the others also leave their ros and Moses was just waiting for a confirmation that to see whose rod is whose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you move around now today. &gt;&gt; You can see the floor is full of rods now. &gt;&gt; And we are waiting for the confirmation. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; You're through a lot. God's rod. The rod of Moses was called God's rod. The Bible called it God's rod. So he cast down God's rod. And you know there was Baptist rod this everybody came with his rod. cast it down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Moses knew that &gt;&gt; come on the scene to confirm. &gt;&gt; Suddenly the rod of Moses &gt;&gt; started to stand up like this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he followed all the roads. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as I say, he didn't bulge. annalated them. [Music] Amen. Let them cast their rods and he's going to shallow them all. [Music]
