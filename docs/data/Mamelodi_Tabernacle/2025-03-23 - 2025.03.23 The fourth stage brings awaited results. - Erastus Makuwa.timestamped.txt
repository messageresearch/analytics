[1:28:44] six how many should they be
[1:28:47] that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6
[1:28:54] six from Cape
[1:28:56] Town oh
[1:28:59] six okay they're all
[1:29:01] here brother B say
[1:29:05] here
[1:29:07] yeah brother B another one another one
[1:29:10] last one I for another
[1:29:16] [Music]
[1:29:22] one brother Bram
[1:29:28] that is that is the first is the placing
[1:29:32] some deacons into the
[1:29:38] church and our little church here is
[1:29:44] Sovereign it doesn't have any
[1:29:47] denomination or anything to send his
[1:29:49] Deacons
[1:29:51] [Applause]
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:55] it elects its own
[1:29:58] deacons it elects its
[1:30:02] Pastor it elects his
[1:30:06] trustees it
[1:30:08] elects everything that comes in and out
[1:30:12] of the
[1:30:18] church no one no one person has the say
[1:30:21] so over anything
[1:30:30] is the
[1:30:32] church and the church are those who
[1:30:38] come and support the the
[1:30:41] church with their
[1:30:45] presence with their
[1:30:48] tithes and
[1:30:51] offerings are always the ones that has
[1:30:54] the legal say
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:00] so in placing of
[1:31:05] such in other words our
[1:31:08] church is the one that
[1:31:12] elects no one is
[1:31:15] electing but we've got a process of
[1:31:19] electing the present
[1:31:22] B the one that will
[1:31:26] elect it will select some
[1:31:30] men which they think they are suitable
[1:31:35] men and after they've selected those
[1:31:39] men they must bring them to the
[1:31:43] pastor and the pastor must look at the
[1:31:47] men and the pastor after looking at them
[1:31:50] man he will screen them
[1:31:54] according to the word of God and ACC the
[1:31:58] spoken way when the pastor is
[1:32:03] satisfied that they are
[1:32:07] qualified then the pastor and the
[1:32:10] church they will take those men into the
[1:32:15] church for the church to vote for
[1:32:20] them for individually
[1:32:25] when they are voted for
[1:32:28] them if they are
[1:32:30] deacons they must be tested
[1:32:35] first they must be given two weeks or
[1:32:38] one
[1:32:41] week the church looking at
[1:32:44] them and we are look and and the both
[1:32:47] looking
[1:32:48] them and they also must satisfy
[1:32:51] themselves
[1:32:53] they are Fe
[1:32:58] people I believe Elders they have done
[1:33:01] the
[1:33:04] same all the process has been
[1:33:07] done when the processes have been
[1:33:11] done then they they are brought to the
[1:33:14] Elder the
[1:33:18] pastor but Prophet
[1:33:21] says put your very best men you can on
[1:33:25] your board you
[1:33:31] see you must just put any man
[1:33:34] there you must put the very best
[1:33:39] man I believe the Cape Town
[1:33:43] Bo and the the the PE
[1:33:46] Bo they've placed the best men they had
[1:33:54] have placed the best
[1:33:57] men head
[1:34:00] because like that brother don't never
[1:34:03] get nothing else in there don't never
[1:34:07] get nothing else in
[1:34:10] there don't don't
[1:34:13] get get nothing that's in
[1:34:18] there put it the best you
[1:34:20] [Music]
[1:34:22] can and test that man
[1:34:26] firstest and a Deon got more
[1:34:29] responsibility than the pastor
[1:34:36] has are you listening
[1:34:39] Brothers they've got more
[1:34:43] responsibility when the church start to
[1:34:46] get
[1:34:49] confused we look at the deons where
[1:34:52] where were the Deacons
[1:34:56] they've got more
[1:34:59] responsibility to keep order in the
[1:35:03] church when people get out of
[1:35:06] order we look at
[1:35:10] the they said the certain man came into
[1:35:12] the church and shoot the
[1:35:16] pastor and the the prophet said where
[1:35:19] were the
[1:35:21] deons because they should have seen him
[1:35:24] when he get inside the
[1:35:26] da what kind of a man was he get inside
[1:35:30] there so that they they should have gone
[1:35:34] after
[1:35:36] him and hold the man before he shoot the
[1:35:42] pastor they shed their
[1:35:48] responsibility he has to be blameless
[1:35:57] [Music]
[1:36:05] a should be in perfect harmony with the
[1:36:09] doctrine of their
[1:36:16] church words they must know the doctrine
[1:36:18] of the church perfectly
[1:36:25] I believe you know the doctrine of your
[1:36:29] church and they must be imperfect
[1:36:34] Harmony that's why when you see a deacon
[1:36:36] getting getting out of
[1:36:41] Step first you must took him
[1:36:46] out
[1:36:48] because if you you leave that man
[1:36:52] there get out of
[1:36:55] Step you are going to destroy the
[1:36:59] church he must be in perfect
[1:37:04] harmony with the doctrine of the
[1:37:08] church he must support you must be the
[1:37:10] first man to support the
[1:37:15] pastor he must be the first to to
[1:37:18] prevent the pastor
[1:37:26] he mustn't be the first man to talk
[1:37:27] about the
[1:37:33] pastor that one must be taken
[1:37:39] off they must be in perfect harmony with
[1:37:42] the doctrine of their
[1:37:45] Church they should stay perfectly the
[1:37:48] interpretation of the scriptures of
[1:37:50] their Church
[1:37:55] because if they
[1:37:56] don't they are fighting against the very
[1:38:03] thing they are they are hating
[1:38:10] themselves
[1:38:11] deacons trusties treasurers must be in
[1:38:16] Perfect
[1:38:19] Harmony among
[1:38:22] themselves amen
[1:38:26] among together with the
[1:38:29] pastor they mustn't do
[1:38:32] anything if the pastor don't know
[1:38:40] [Applause]
[1:38:46] it um I've read the
[1:38:51] order and the prophet say
[1:38:56] now let this first be try
[1:39:01] it and see if they desire the
[1:39:06] office within a few
[1:39:09] weeks God
[1:39:11] willing I will return back to lay hands
[1:39:15] upon this group of
[1:39:17] men to make them the official the
[1:39:21] official
[1:39:25] the official deacons of this church and
[1:39:27] trust and
[1:39:34] treasur we've got I've left a book
[1:39:38] somewhere but doesn't
[1:39:41] matter an
[1:39:43] elder is an
[1:39:45] elder because of his
[1:39:50] age in the church
[1:39:54] and his
[1:39:58] St and his
[1:40:03] reliability in the
[1:40:07] church then we see that one is
[1:40:11] an whether ordained or not
[1:40:14] ordained not not elected or not
[1:40:18] elect but because of his chronological
[1:40:21] age
[1:40:24] in the
[1:40:25] church it qualifies
[1:40:28] him to be an elder in the
[1:40:31] church but reliability must be
[1:40:38] there when he when when cases
[1:40:42] arise he has got an
[1:40:45] experience he come far with this
[1:40:49] church he knows things which happen
[1:40:52] there and how those things were
[1:40:55] solved and when things are brought to
[1:40:59] him because he will help the deacons and
[1:41:02] the
[1:41:05] trustees he must be a reliable
[1:41:09] [Music]
[1:41:11] man the man who doesn't take
[1:41:20] sight let me read something here
[1:41:25] tonight we have little change in the
[1:41:27] [Music]
[1:41:29] service but today I say
[1:41:33] today this morning we have change in
[1:41:37] the we have F brother
[1:41:42] here they come to ask
[1:41:46] from say from Nazar
[1:41:51] church I would say from
[1:41:54] Elizabeth in cap town I think that is
[1:41:58] right he called the name he said
[1:42:01] brother wishing tonight to be ordained
[1:42:04] by
[1:42:08] us by laying hands

[1:42:16] anyone yet we are
[1:42:20] recognized we could have papers we could
[1:42:24] we could but we believe that a a true
[1:42:29] ordained
[1:42:36] minister his papers is in
[1:42:41] heaven see he has the right to preach
[1:42:45] the
[1:42:47] Bible as long as God identifies his life
[1:42:51] with the Bible
[1:42:55] we believe that that is his
[1:43:01] credential you find something different
[1:43:05] in out of the Bible if you
[1:43:09] do it will be out of the
[1:43:11] Bible that is exactly the way they did
[1:43:14] in the Bible
[1:43:17] time was laying hands upon them
[1:43:23] in
[1:43:25] ordination they laid hands upon the
[1:43:29] deons and put them in the church and
[1:43:34] everything was by laying of
[1:43:37] hands not signing up a bunch of
[1:43:41] papers joining a
[1:43:46] certain something like that they laid
[1:43:49] hands

[1:43:56] Spirit and let him go amen amen God lead
[1:44:01] him the way he wants

[1:44:17] people we we are not making them
[1:44:21] deons they they really chosen by the
[1:44:24] church we give them the right of

[2:08:49] prophets one of
[2:08:52] Martin
[2:08:53] Luther he began to shine a little
[2:08:59] light
[2:09:00] but there was little light just very
[2:09:04] small
[2:09:05] [Music]
[2:09:08] strength of
[2:09:10] justification Along come
[2:09:13] Wesley stronger
[2:09:17] sanctification in other words it was a
[2:09:19] stronger light
[2:09:23] and after
[2:09:25] wle come the stronger than
[2:09:28] him
[2:09:30] Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy
[2:09:33] Ghost in another great
[2:09:38] prophecy but in the last
[2:09:41] days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with
[2:09:46] the very
[2:09:49] weight the weight of the the
[2:09:52] Lord come to the
[2:09:54] prophet in the evening
[2:09:57] life is to come
[2:10:00] forth to restore
[2:10:04] all and bring
[2:10:06] back what turn the hearts of the
[2:10:12] children to the faith of
[2:10:16] God the fourth
[2:10:19] light as we have said the fourth
[2:10:24] stage will bring the requested the
[2:10:28] awaited
[2:10:31] results this Malachi chapter
[2:10:34] 4 brought the fourth
[2:10:38] light not man
[2:10:41] per but the son of
[2:10:44] man revealed
[2:10:47] himself he
[2:10:49] himself the son of man
[2:10:51] revealed
[2:10:53] himself in a
[2:10:55] man called
[2:10:58] William the son of man revealed himself
[2:11:02] there then the son of man was bringing
[2:11:06] the awaited
[2:11:09] results because the son of man is
[2:11:14] Christ and the son of man is the one who
[2:11:18] brought what we needed
[2:11:23] he he brought back
[2:11:26] life all these
[2:11:28] ways it was little little
[2:11:31] little until it comes to the
[2:11:35] for this man brought the last
[2:11:40] thing because the seventh
[2:11:43] seal and the third
[2:11:46] pool they are they are this they are
[2:11:49] they are in unity
[2:11:52] because the seven
[2:11:54] SE is is in fact the thing that brings
[2:11:58] the hearts of the
[2:12:03] children back to the faith of their
[2:12:06] fathers without the revelation of the
[2:12:09] seven
[2:12:11] SE there is no bringing back of
[2:12:15] us the heart are brought
[2:12:19] back by the revelation of the seven
[2:12:23] se but if there is no revelation of the
[2:12:26] seven
[2:12:28] SE then we have got no revelation of the
[2:12:31] son of
[2:12:32] man then we don't have
[2:12:36] MC because
[2:12:38] M revealed
[2:12:40] himself through the
[2:12:45] man in in those
[2:12:49] days it was a man there
[2:12:52] who Abraham gave him food to
[2:12:57] eat but it was a man who just
[2:13:02] took
[2:13:04] soil and made a
[2:13:06] body and go inside it but in our days by
[2:13:12] Grace is a man who was
[2:13:16] [Applause]
[2:13:18] born by men and woman
[2:13:27] uh this this fourth stage
[2:13:30] here but let me just go back a
[2:13:35] little when we go back to the second
[2:13:40] Kings we find that Elijah moved for
[2:13:43] three for four
[2:13:47] steps he moved from Gil
[2:13:52] to
[2:13:54] from to from to then after Jord is where
[2:14:01] he get the the awaited
[2:14:05] results when when they were there
[2:14:08] together with
[2:14:10] Elijah at B said Elijah said to
[2:14:17] Elijah stay here
[2:14:21] when they are at
[2:14:23] gil stay here I am going to
[2:14:28] bet God called me
[2:14:32] there and in
[2:14:34] betel which was the house of
[2:14:38] God Elijah
[2:14:40] said to
[2:14:43] Elish just stay here and elishah
[2:14:46] couldn't think that
[2:14:49] way because he know there was more for
[2:14:56] him so he said as the Lord
[2:15:00] leaveth and you are so leaveth I will
[2:15:04] not leave
[2:15:06] you it was an inwhite
[2:15:10] following not outside one he was like
[2:15:15] Peter when Peter said to
[2:15:17] Jesus to whom shall we go
[2:15:21] because the word of eternal
[2:15:24] life is in
[2:15:26] you that is what Peter
[2:15:28] said also
[2:15:31] Elijah said
[2:15:33] here I will never leave
[2:15:36] you because there was an inside
[2:15:40] connection which cannot be broken by
[2:15:44] anything he wanted something inside this
[2:15:48] man which some people have not seen
[2:15:53] he was the only one who has seen
[2:15:55] that there at B he found a bunch of
[2:16:00] Scholars
[2:16:01] there they were all well trained
[2:16:06] preachers they said to
[2:16:09] elishah do you know that your master is
[2:16:12] going to be taken away from
[2:16:16] you the a man that has ever tasted God
[2:16:24] you cannot quench his
[2:16:27] test a man-made
[2:16:31] citizen because he has tated
[2:16:35] something he tated something from
[2:16:38] El he said as you as the Lord
[2:16:43] leave and you are so leave it I will
[2:16:47] never leave
[2:16:49] you we know God
[2:16:52] lived in your
[2:16:54] soul and you also live you live in your
[2:16:59] soul then if God is in your
[2:17:02] soul if God lives in your soul you are
[2:17:06] in your soul then you and God the
[2:17:09] one if your soul is from
[2:17:13] there and God is from there then when
[2:17:17] you see God you will recognize him
[2:17:21] but if your soul is not from
[2:17:24] there if God is presented to
[2:17:27] you and if you are from there if God is
[2:17:31] presented to you in whatever
[2:17:34] form you will recognize him but if you
[2:17:38] are not from there you will recognize
[2:17:41] God in some
[2:17:44] form the form which they have told you
[2:17:46] that God is
[2:17:49] there you will try to to believe
[2:17:53] that but some things will stop you from
[2:17:56] believing
[2:17:58] that because your connection is not from
[2:18:03] there but if it is from
[2:18:05] there when you see God in any
[2:18:13] form go go send us a
[2:18:18] prophet he he has called us
[2:18:23] to come
[2:18:25] out when the prophet was
[2:18:28] preaching I wasn't
[2:18:32] there but
[2:18:34] I I've heard the
[2:18:36] prophet through this
[2:18:40] man when he was preaching I wasn't
[2:18:43] there but now I'm preaching the
[2:18:46] prophet because someone
[2:18:50] [Music]
[2:18:52] [Applause]
[2:18:54] because when
[2:18:56] Moses had to leave the children of
[2:19:00] God children of
[2:19:02] isra through
[2:19:05] death he placed
[2:19:11] J but there was the request of the
[2:19:14] people they said to
[2:19:16] Joshua Joshua Joshua whatever you said
[2:19:20] to to
[2:19:22] us whatever you say we must
[2:19:26] do we will do
[2:19:29] it but on
[2:19:32] condition if the God was in
[2:19:36] Moses if you can see him in
[2:19:40] you then whatever you
[2:19:43] say then we will follow
[2:19:47] it if the prophet said the weight is
[2:19:52] this is a secret the weight is in the
[2:19:56] bright then he's
[2:20:02] G but you see under
[2:20:06] predestination God has pred that each
[2:20:12] age there must be a messenger
[2:20:16] there and under each messenger
[2:20:20] there must be pastors
[2:20:23] there but for
[2:20:29] ordained
[2:20:31] pastors who were there in the mind of
[2:20:34] God when God was amen putting the ages
[2:20:40] [Music]
[2:20:41] together when he was putting the age and
[2:20:44] the
[2:20:44] [Music]
[2:20:46] messenger he was putting also the pastor
[2:20:52] that will continue the
[2:20:54] ministry the way the prophet the way the
[2:20:56] messenger has
[2:20:59] preached they will
[2:21:01] continue that's why we are
[2:21:06] [Applause]
[2:21:08] here I'm preaching what I'm preaching
[2:21:11] what brother has
[2:21:14] said because
[2:21:17] someone who has the connection
[2:21:22] connection with the
[2:21:23] prophet preached it to
[2:21:27] me it
[2:21:29] was the current
[2:21:33] moving move from the Power
[2:21:36] Station moving from the electrical
[2:21:40] powers until to that station
[2:21:44] there all all things which connect from
[2:21:48] that they have got the same
[2:21:52] [Applause]
[2:21:56] Elijah El saw something like that just
[2:22:00] like
[2:22:02] me he said if the Lord
[2:22:06] leaveth and you are
[2:22:10] soul then if the soul of the pastor
[2:22:14] leave it means God is living
[2:22:18] [Applause]
[2:22:21] if that soul is
[2:22:25] dead the world is not
[2:22:31] living those who are
[2:22:33] following they following
[2:22:37] amen not
[2:22:40] God because it must be
[2:22:46] predestination a predestinated pastor
[2:22:50] predestinated
[2:22:53] sheep they will see the predestinate
[2:22:57] pastor and see the predestinate
[2:23:02] messenger because it's a
[2:23:04] chain you cannot cut
[2:23:10] it it must be from there it must be from
[2:23:14] there coming down until here
[2:23:20] [Applause]
[2:23:24] then you are taken back your heart is
[2:23:31] brought
[2:23:33] back you see we were
[2:23:36] preaching we were
[2:23:40] reading you I've read the book of
[2:23:45] seals I have read it several times and
[2:23:50] until it becomes in
[2:23:54] TAS but one day when the
[2:23:59] p with the revelation of
[2:24:03] it then I left it when I look at it I
[2:24:08] just see what they
[2:24:12] want because someone
[2:24:14] revealed to
[2:24:18] me the seven SE
[2:24:22] when the seven SE is revealed to
[2:24:25] you it reveals
[2:24:28] [Music]
[2:24:34] everything let me that's why what this
[2:24:37] Elijah has
[2:24:40] seen there are people who are hating
[2:24:47] pastors Pastor is nothing
[2:24:54] if they are not from there you
[2:24:57] see you are predestinated under this
[2:25:05] pastor who is not
[2:25:08] predestinated
[2:25:11] will those who are
[2:25:13] predestinated they will
[2:25:16] remain because I read somewhere
[2:25:20] the the the resurrection be like a
[2:25:26] wave you say will be the the
[2:25:29] messenger and the pastors under the
[2:25:32] messenger and the ships under this
[2:25:35] pastor just a
[2:25:39] w and if you say pastors are
[2:25:42] nothing you don't have a pastor when the
[2:25:46] Resurrection comes when the P when The
[2:25:48] Messengers come
[2:25:50] and pastors come with their ship them
[2:25:54] where are you going to
[2:25:56] [Applause]
[2:26:00] appear there is no sheep will be hanging
[2:26:05] there say no I'm under the
[2:26:10] messenger that is not predestination of
[2:26:13] God that is not the purpose of
[2:26:16] God the purpose of God was the messenger
[2:26:21] the pastors and the
[2:26:23] [Applause]
[2:26:30] Sheep but it is it is by
[2:26:36] Grace if you can have an
[2:26:39] eye just like this
[2:26:42] man to
[2:26:44] recognize where God
[2:26:49] is people were
[2:26:51] there he say he found a bunch of
[2:26:54] Scholars they were
[2:26:56] all well trained
[2:26:59] preachers they said to
[2:27:02] Elijah they they trying to tell Elijah
[2:27:05] the
[2:27:07] secret they say do you know your master
[2:27:11] is going to be taken away
[2:27:15] from Elijah said because a man who ever
[2:27:19] tasted God
[2:27:22] cannot be his test his his his
[2:27:27] Fest will never be quenched by
[2:27:33] anything it will not be quenched by a
[2:27:35] manmade
[2:27:40] citizens he he didn't have time for that
[2:27:43] kind of
[2:27:45] stuff he had done tasted heaven
[2:27:50] in his
[2:27:52] soul listen to what he said yes I know

[2:36:04] part of this
[2:36:08] man he wanted
[2:36:12] it he
[2:36:15] followed must be a good follower
[2:36:21] at Jordan there Elijah took his
[2:36:25] rope smth the water of Jordan and Jordan
[2:36:29] open up they cross on a
[2:36:32] dry when they got on the other
[2:36:35] side not when he was at

[2:37:57] them when the Chariot of fire went
[2:38:01] up the of
[2:38:04] Elijah came
[2:38:06] down that's why when the prophet
[2:38:10] goes he said this is the
[2:38:13] secret the word that is the final
[2:38:18] stage has given us the final awaited
[2:38:23] result he said
