[1:28:57] he or she is not a
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:02] stranger to the word of
[1:29:05] God as the Bible
[1:29:09] says you were
[1:29:12] chosen
[1:29:14] where in
[1:29:17] him I wonder if somebody has considered
[1:29:23] this
[1:29:25] for you were
[1:29:26] chosen
[1:29:28] in
[1:29:30] him
[1:29:32] amen as another scripture
[1:29:37] says what does that scripture say uh
[1:29:41] Ephesians chapter
[1:29:44] 4
[1:29:46] verse 30 amen Ephesians
[1:29:53] 4:3 as he
[1:29:58] hasi
[1:30:00] says and grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:30:03] God whereby ye are sealed unto the day
[1:30:06] of
[1:30:08] redemption now the day of
[1:30:14] redemption do you
[1:30:16] still uh remember that the day of
[1:30:20] redemption is the day the book was open
[1:30:27] amen amen the day of
[1:30:30] redemption now there are some
[1:30:34] people here and
[1:30:37] elsewhere
[1:30:40] who who are redeemed
[1:30:44] already for their names are written in
[1:30:48] the Lamb's Book
[1:30:52] of now
[1:30:54] according to Revelation
[1:30:58] 5 the Bible
[1:31:01] says uh there was this
[1:31:05] one

[1:31:14] throne and uh with a book in
[1:31:21] his amen amen
[1:31:25] and when I read this part
[1:31:29] maybe maybe one day you will hear
[1:31:33] it it says the
[1:31:37] lamb took the
[1:31:40] book within
[1:31:45] himself that's why in each and every
[1:31:51] predestinated son or daughter
[1:31:58] there is a white
[1:32:04] stone that's
[1:32:07] why there was the samarit
[1:32:12] woman and before even the Lord appeared
[1:32:17] in this
[1:32:21] body she was going around saying
[1:32:25] I
[1:32:32] knowah
[1:32:33] and he will tell us all
[1:32:40] things

[1:42:02] God God said to Moses one
[1:42:08] day tell this
[1:42:11] people that I have spoken to you from
[1:42:18] heavenu you remember that
[1:42:21] scripture I have spoken
[1:42:24] with you
[1:42:28] from if we can worship God in such a
[1:42:36] place where a
[1:42:39] speaker can say God has spoken to
[1:42:44] me from
[1:42:47] Heaven amen amen
[1:42:50] amen as about that woman
[1:42:54] do you remember
[1:42:56] that it
[1:42:58] says when that woman
[1:43:03] said what you have
[1:43:05] said is the
[1:43:09] truth and the prophet of God
[1:43:12] said God
[1:43:15] spoke
[1:43:19] continue amen yeah God spoken
[1:43:25] her her
[1:43:28] heart what she
[1:43:30] said the Samaritan women say I know
[1:43:34] Messiah
[1:43:36] coming when he has come he will tell
[1:43:41] us I Want To Worship in such a
[1:43:47] place instead of here here a bit of the
[1:43:53] of
[1:43:54] God tomorrow I go to that
[1:43:57] church pick up
[1:44:00] some no we want to
[1:44:04] worship where he
[1:44:07] is that's why the woman said I know and
[1:44:13] now keep this
[1:44:15] word
[1:44:17] I yes you should
[1:44:21] know amen
[1:44:23] I come here because there's something I
[1:44:29] know and that thing that
[1:44:32] knowledge keep keeps me
[1:44:36] coming because I
[1:44:39] know amen and that woman
[1:44:42] said I know mesiah is
[1:44:46] coming and when he has come he will tell
[1:44:51] us all things
[1:44:53] she knew already that what she has heard
[1:44:58] is not all all things but she's waiting
[1:45:02] for somebody will come to tell her all
[1:45:06] things and I want to
[1:45:09] worship where God can tell
[1:45:12] me all
[1:45:14] things
[1:45:16] [Music]

[1:45:25] church when are you going to preach the
[1:45:29] seven
[1:45:31] seies and he said I don't know
[1:45:35] them now I couldn't Worship in such a
[1:45:43] place because every
[1:45:46] time the word is
[1:45:48] preached then I would know it is not all
[1:45:51] things
[1:45:54] a Christian is made of all
[1:45:59] things which is the word of
[1:46:02] God
[1:46:03] Amen that's why a Christian don't hit
[1:46:08] this pole and that PO and so
[1:46:12] for since Jesus came
[1:46:18] into she is
[1:46:21] settled
[1:46:31] amen that's why
[1:46:34] I'm let me
[1:46:36] read I saw heaven
[1:46:41] open some
[1:46:43] people worshiped in this
[1:46:47] way where sometimes you can see
[1:46:51] heaven
[1:46:54] John
[1:46:56] also the words came to John
[1:47:01] said come up
[1:47:04] here and I will is that Revelation
[1:47:09] chapter
[1:47:10] 4 come up
[1:47:13] here and I will show you
[1:47:17] things to
[1:47:19] come brother somebody don't know that
[1:47:22] scripture
[1:47:24] just read that scripture Revelation
[1:47:28] 4:1 after this I looked and behold a
[1:47:31] door was opened in heaven and the first
[1:47:34] voice which I heard was as it were of a
[1:47:37] trumpet talking with me which said come
[1:47:40] up hither and I will show thee things
[1:47:43] which must be Hereafter
[1:47:45] amen
[1:47:48] uh was it a man who spoke those
[1:47:51] words
[1:47:58] the man who
[1:48:01] says the man who has
[1:48:05] received the word from
[1:48:08] Heaven who is that
[1:48:11] man or is a man like me and
[1:48:17] you then I'm glad
[1:48:20] that if John
[1:48:25] received not like a telephone
[1:48:28] call but a voice he
[1:48:34] clearly that said come
[1:48:38] up
[1:48:40] yeah did he Book for a
[1:48:46] flight okay amen it was a
[1:48:51] direct come here
[1:48:53] and I will show
[1:48:56] you now
[1:48:58] when I approach the
[1:49:01] prophet he says it was from the church
[1:49:07] ages Church ages speak of
[1:49:12] time but after church
[1:49:14] ages that's why we speak of
[1:49:19] Angels the pyramid has changed
[1:49:23] from being a
[1:49:25] pyramid H but into a pyramid of
[1:49:31] angels we were sharing about
[1:49:35] it again amen all right amen that that
[1:49:38] is he hey
[1:49:42] hey the
[1:49:44] message is not
[1:49:46] just Jesus is alive Jesus can heal Noh
[1:49:50] this is the gospel here come up
[1:49:56] here and I
[1:50:00] will amen am that is God speaking to a
[1:50:04] man like
[1:50:09] you because this man
[1:50:13] was a
[1:50:16] member in the
[1:50:19] church he was coming through
[1:50:23] the seven Church ages
[1:50:26] churches like me and
[1:50:30] you if you don't
[1:50:34] change to come up
[1:50:38] higher you end up with the
[1:50:41] mind of being a
[1:50:44] Christian but it works indeed in your
[1:50:48] mind you are not a
[1:50:51] Christian
[1:50:54] CHR that
[1:50:56] man was in fellowship with
[1:51:00] God until God lifted him
[1:51:05] up powerful amen if you are in line with
[1:51:10] God God will bring you
[1:51:16] always to some
[1:51:20] high amen amen amen remain in
[1:51:24] him remain in his
[1:51:28] way amen amen and you'll see
[1:51:35] him
[1:51:36] uh I know a real
[1:51:41] Christian is somebody who wants to see
[1:51:46] God Amen you see we are talking about
[1:51:49] the Rapture
[1:51:51] now the Lord is
[1:51:54] coming
[1:51:56] signs are
[1:51:58] there I have seen them I'm satisfied
[1:52:02] that the Rapture is
[1:52:08] here amen amen so a real real Christian
[1:52:15] today his
[1:52:17] mind is only about the
[1:52:20] coming of the Lord
[1:52:24] amen
[1:52:27] because that's theing
[1:52:35] in you know the song
[1:52:40] [Music]
[1:52:51] says he's beyond all the
[1:53:01] dimensions
[1:53:09] uh like you can't find God through a
[1:53:13] cell
[1:53:18] phone and you are quiet maybe you know
[1:53:21] something about can
[1:53:25] you God never said he will communicate
[1:53:28] with you through a cell
[1:53:31] phone but he said through the Holy
[1:53:38] Ghost and by
[1:53:44] Revelation you know what is
[1:53:49] revelation the people that
[1:53:51] are
[1:53:53] on the way
[1:53:55] home they have received that
[1:54:00] Revelation it's not just a
[1:54:06] scripture no there's something in the
[1:54:08] heart of a
[1:54:12] man that has put
[1:54:14] him that
[1:54:17] reality that Jesus is
[1:54:21] coming amen amen that's why the
[1:54:24] Samaritan
[1:54:25] woman she didn't just quote
[1:54:29] scriptures the pastor says but she said
[1:54:34] I
[1:54:36] know mesiah is coming it's not just what
[1:54:40] the preaching is all
[1:54:44] about but me
[1:54:47] personally I know that mesiah is coming
[1:54:52] and I even know that when he has come he
[1:54:56] will tell us
[1:55:01] all amen I
[1:55:03] know we know that the Rapture is
[1:55:07] coming amen amen amen and you know if
[1:55:13] you know something about something from
[1:55:19] God you don't argue with those who don't
[1:55:22] know
[1:55:24] amen because that woman it was revealed
[1:55:28] to
[1:55:30] her Messiah is
[1:55:34] coming amen amen and she didn't
[1:55:38] dispute she only said I
[1:55:43] know you know I love
[1:55:45] this me
[1:55:47] personally I
[1:55:51] know
[1:55:52] now if he knows who else can tell her
[1:55:57] the
[1:55:59] difference she
[1:56:02] knows if you know that the Rapture is
[1:56:06] coming who can tell
[1:56:13] you like a brother said to our
[1:56:19] brother yes the Bible says he's coming
[1:56:23] but hey it's just that you too too
[1:56:29] forward yes we also believe he's
[1:56:32] coming the way you are you are too much
[1:56:35] because she was not
[1:56:40] prepared if you are still doing your
[1:56:43] things you are not
[1:56:46] prepared because you don't have the
[1:56:49] revelation of the
[1:56:51] rapture
[1:56:52] only the people with the revelation of
[1:56:54] the
[1:56:57] rupture prepared
[1:57:01] themselves amen because
[1:57:04] already they are in
[1:57:08] there Supernatural
[1:57:13] area you know it is like this every time
[1:57:18] you expect to to be
[1:57:21] taken
[1:57:25] amen he didn't give us the year or the
[1:57:30] week
[1:57:32] or but he gave us the
[1:57:38] Revelation amen so
[1:57:41] much
[1:57:45] that when I woke up when I wake up in
[1:57:49] the
[1:57:50] morning I wake wake up
[1:57:56] expecting to be taken
[1:58:01] away a
[1:58:04] person at the
[1:58:08] airport he has prepared
[1:58:11] everything bought the
[1:58:13] ticket went
[1:58:17] through checking
[1:58:21] points
[1:58:22] then the last thing he's just
[1:58:31] waiting he makes sure or she makes sure
[1:58:35] that
[1:58:36] everything has been
[1:58:38] done is just to
[1:58:44] wait you'll see him
[1:58:47] checking every time there
[1:58:50] watch just like us
[1:58:53] [Applause]
[1:58:55] we have our not rest watch
[1:59:01] but he said when you see this and this
[1:59:04] and this and
[1:59:06] this know that the time
[1:59:13] is but you'll wonder some people don't
[1:59:17] see
[1:59:18] that because they are not
[1:59:23] on the waiting
[1:59:25] list they are not
[1:59:30] going
[1:59:33] amen if they were
[1:59:36] allowed they could say Lord please don't
[1:59:40] come
[1:59:43] now we are still
[1:59:47] busy I still want to throw a party for
[1:59:50] my
[1:59:51] children
[1:59:56] but the people from
[2:00:00] heaven right now there's something
[2:00:04] bubbling
[2:00:07] in that's why the Bible says Enoch
[2:00:12] walked with
[2:00:17] God Amen he walked with
[2:00:20] God pleased God so
[2:00:25] much until God took him
[2:00:30] away the Bible says he pleased
[2:00:37] God can you please
[2:00:41] God he walked with
[2:00:43] God God let us read
[2:00:48] this the first
[2:00:50] scripture that's why I read that
[2:00:54] also uh 19 I saw heaven
[2:00:58] open Chapter 19 Verse 11
[2:01:02] Revelation and I saw heaven
[2:01:05] open and
[2:01:08] behold
[2:01:10] white I understand white is the original
[2:01:17] color and he that set upon him was
[2:01:21] called faith
[2:01:24] for
[2:01:26] True in
[2:01:29] righteous does
[2:01:32] judge and make war amen that's when the
[2:01:36] Battle of aedon is
[2:01:42] coming
[2:01:45] and I have read to you that part where
[2:01:48] where it
[2:01:49] says the battle of
[2:01:55] was
[2:01:56] fought started
[2:01:59] [Music]
[2:02:01] when amen and in from
[2:02:06] Heaven Lucifer
[2:02:09] Lucifer
[2:02:11] the worshippers of Lucifer they call him
[2:02:18] father that's right
[2:02:20] amen
[2:02:22] is brother Victor

[2:02:34] about a sister I won't call
[2:02:39] names that they have been wait looking
[2:02:43] for that
[2:02:44] sister they were looking for that
[2:02:48] sister she's a family member
[2:02:54] then I think it was for
[2:02:58] three
[2:03:00] weeks then I I prayed with
[2:03:05] them then one
[2:03:08] day uh I'm not

[2:03:53] but he or she
[2:03:55] has a royal
[2:04:02] hearing

[2:04:12] through they are
[2:04:15] disputed people don't believe
[2:04:20] them
[2:04:22] but do do you really believe that what
[2:04:24] is saying is
[2:04:26] there one was telling me

[2:05:06] the Lim or
[2:05:09] what there was a
[2:05:12] sister uh we were Seated on the back

[2:05:28] place
[2:05:29] now he spoke to one of our
[2:05:33] sisters I don't know how it
[2:05:36] started but I I could only hear when he
[2:05:41] said do you believe that there's a
[2:05:44] Garden of
[2:05:46] Eden the sister says
[2:05:49] yes then he said
[2:05:52] can you explain that can you show
[2:05:55] me the sister said it is in the
[2:06:00] Bible but he said can you prove
[2:06:07] it and I said to the sister sister this

[2:18:52] continue who to the Inhibitors of the
[2:18:55] earth Inhibitors of the

[2:19:05] rupture they are called the Dwellers
[2:19:12] of they operate in
[2:19:16] Dimensions not in
[2:19:19] glory all right now we'll come to

[2:20:14] time for him has
[2:20:17] come only the people don't know
[2:20:25] now this is during
[2:20:36] the
[2:20:39] tribulation When the Saints have been

[2:20:44] up now it says who unto
[2:20:48] you rejoice you
[2:20:52] dwellers those who dwell in
[2:20:55] heaven after the

[2:21:44] SE who are the Dwellers of the
[2:21:49] sea
[2:21:57] notw of the

[2:22:47] Pharaoh and the other kings and the
[2:22:51] Queens amen the Dwellers of the

[2:23:03] morning to the water before Pharaoh
[2:23:08] arrived
[2:23:09] there because Pharaoh operated from the

[2:24:54] written that no man
[2:24:57] knew but he
