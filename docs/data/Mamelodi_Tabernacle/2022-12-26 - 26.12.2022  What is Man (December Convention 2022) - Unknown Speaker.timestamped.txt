[2:10:01] six seven in my book paragraph one okay
[2:10:05] five six seven one okay
[2:10:09] let's have it brother I think is it from
[2:10:14] the same is it from the same Bible we
[2:10:18] requested
[2:10:19] yes okay amen Hebrews chapter two
[2:10:24] verse six to nine
[2:10:26] part one in a certain place Justified
[2:10:29] saying what is meant that thou art
[2:10:33] mindful of him or the son of man that
[2:10:36] thou visitors him
[2:10:38] Thou made as him a little lower than the
[2:10:41] Angels thou countest him with glory and
[2:10:44] on and did set him over the works of thy
[2:10:48] hands thou has put all things in
[2:10:51] subjection under his feet for in that he
[2:10:54] put all in subjection under him he left
[2:10:58] nothing that is not put under him but
[2:11:01] now we see not yet all things put under
[2:11:03] him but we see Jesus who was made a
[2:11:07] little lower than the angels for the
[2:11:10] suffering of death crowned with Glory
[2:11:13] and Honor that he by the grace of God
[2:11:16] shall taste death for every man
[2:11:18] amen
[2:11:21] [Music]
[2:11:27] what is
[2:11:33] that you consider so much
[2:11:38] we're talking with their brothers this
[2:11:40] morning
[2:11:41] this morning yeah because it says but we
[2:11:45] see Jesus Jesus
[2:11:50] Jesus Jason is God came to him who took
[2:11:55] the form of men amen
[2:11:59] for men is so important
[2:12:04] that's why he says
[2:12:10] either you see this the man or you see
[2:12:13] Jesus
[2:12:17] I mean I mean and
[2:12:20] now I read I'm going to read
[2:12:25] the
[2:12:27] our series book book
[2:12:32] we have page five six seven
[2:12:36] five six seven and uh before we start I
[2:12:42] hope
[2:12:43] I I have that book with me

[2:12:52] Pokemon
[2:12:55] uh is that five six seven seven five six
[2:13:00] seven
[2:13:01] okay bear with me and uh
[2:13:07] will come there
[2:13:11] I have
[2:13:12] yeah five six seven letter gonna five
[2:13:15] six seven what's this great
[2:13:19] secrets that lays beneath this seal
[2:13:25] Cecilia
[2:13:27] that's why
[2:13:30] Heaven remained quiet too
[2:13:35] with we looked at it even yesterday
[2:13:40] how the Angels come over
[2:13:45] stop
[2:13:47] when it was revealed
[2:13:52] so great that the Angels stop says
[2:13:59] why they stopped I think we have seen it
[2:14:03] yesterday
[2:14:07] where we're dealing with the seventh
[2:14:11] seal we are really available
[2:14:14] and
[2:14:16] the third pool
[2:14:18] three I mean the seventh seal and
[2:14:21] they're three-fold Revelations
[2:14:27] the threefold Revelation
[2:14:31] let me read it
[2:14:33] Christ
[2:14:37] amen
[2:14:54] yeah she page
[2:14:58] 60. we are going back to that
[2:15:01] Jesus said yes
[2:15:06] then he says that's this day amen
[2:15:14] okay amen
[2:15:16] that's this
[2:15:20] no yes amen
[2:15:22] at that day does she live but she says
[2:15:25] that's this day
[2:15:29] he said so
[2:15:31] um
[2:15:35] that is that's this day amen
[2:15:42] when this Revelation is made known
[2:15:50] it does being a revelation but not made
[2:15:52] known
[2:15:54] but when it is made known
[2:15:58] Jesus spoke of it
[2:16:00] at that day
[2:16:03] another thing he says you shall
[2:16:08] know amen
[2:16:12] I
[2:16:13] I have checked through
[2:16:16] to see whether I know
[2:16:22] because if it is
[2:16:25] this day
[2:16:28] then there's something I know
[2:16:33] amen and there is something you know
[2:16:38] amen but it's coming
[2:16:41] through this threefold manifestation
[2:16:52] you shall know at that day that I am in
[2:16:57] foreign
[2:17:29] amen
[2:17:42] God being part
[2:17:44] men be being part of that threefold
[2:17:51] that's why
[2:17:53] we realize here that when the seal is
[2:17:57] revealed
[2:17:59] amen amen only
[2:18:03] the threefold okay fell out all
[2:18:06] threefolded
[2:18:07] it is
[2:18:10] this revelation
[2:18:13] comes
[2:18:15] through the three-fold amen
[2:18:20] now
[2:18:22] what what is this threefold not
[2:18:25] threefold we'll see what is this
[2:18:28] three-fold one or threefold amen amen
[2:18:31] that's how God operates on
[2:18:53] coming from
[2:18:56] all the way before Genesis
[2:18:58] [Music]
[2:19:04] Cod
[2:19:09] the first God is a spirit
[2:19:14] then it says the logos logos then it
[2:19:17] says out of the logos
[2:19:24] so that is the threefold
[2:19:26] the father 30 and then uh what follows
[2:19:34] amen
[2:19:47] foreign
[2:20:09] [Music]
[2:20:20] and that makes but it is in a three-fold
[2:20:28] now when the seals were opened up
[2:20:34] uh even the sixth year
[2:20:37] when it was opened let me just read
[2:20:41] something quickly
[2:20:43] okay I mean God bless you God bless you
[2:20:47] all right amen
[2:20:54] the mystery of these seven series
[2:21:01] firstly I will start here
[2:21:03] he omitted the revelation of the seventh
[2:21:07] seal will at least
[2:21:10] amen when the seventh seal when he
[2:21:14] opened it
[2:21:16] he also omitted it
[2:21:19] reality again
[2:21:21] so we see that it's in a complete
[2:21:25] mystery therefore
[2:21:29] the hour is not yet for this mystery to
[2:21:33] be
[2:21:34] known
[2:21:39] all right amen it was
[2:21:42] he omitted it holy treat because the
[2:21:46] hour now
[2:21:48] was not yet for the mystery to be known
[2:21:55] therefore we are this far
[2:22:01] and the rest of it will be known
[2:22:06] now are you listening carefully
[2:22:10] will be known it will see right around
[2:22:13] about the time that Jesus
[2:22:17] appears on the air okay
[2:22:24] amen
[2:22:26] again for the his bride
[2:22:30] or what whatever
[2:22:34] uh take its place at that time
[2:22:39] amen amen
[2:22:42] uh you know we we once spoke about this
[2:22:47] where the Prophet says it is not
[2:22:51] revealed
[2:22:53] to the public
[2:22:57] but he said
[2:23:01] let us
[2:23:03] he said as far as we can go
[2:23:08] right there and now I trust that each
[2:23:11] and every one of you
[2:23:16] and do that which is right
[2:23:22] uh
[2:23:25] all with all your life your your life
[2:23:29] and save him
[2:23:32] and God will take care of
[2:23:36] the rest amen
[2:23:40] amen
[2:23:42] amen amen
[2:23:44] you know we
[2:23:47] I didn't need to pray for the revelation
[2:23:51] of the Southern seals
[2:23:54] because he has already told me that it
[2:23:58] is it will be
[2:24:12] it was revealed amen
[2:24:18] but to the rest
[2:24:28] not revealed now
[2:24:33] you know something can be revealed to
[2:24:36] somebody
[2:24:39] amen amen and
[2:24:42] but
[2:24:43] to be known to the others
[2:24:47] to be made known to the others foreign
[2:24:55] [Music]
[2:25:33] for you
[2:25:35] it will be you made it it will be not
[2:25:40] revealed but made known
[2:25:43] it was revealed to this man Prophet
[2:25:47] leave it alone
[2:25:50] and he also said I must stop here
[2:25:54] because it was not yet revealed to the
[2:25:58] public
[2:26:01] but yet it was revealed but it will be
[2:26:05] made known
[2:26:08] to be made known is to know what was
[2:26:12] revealed
[2:26:16] amen amen now others were not waiting
[2:26:19] for the for it to be revealed
[2:26:23] because it was already revealed
[2:26:28] the public
[2:26:30] has not made known to the public
[2:26:35] firstly
[2:26:49] today
[2:26:55] and he kept quiet
[2:26:58] knowing that God will do the rest
[2:27:04] amen amen so we are looking at this
[2:27:11] even The Sixth Seal really
[2:27:14] here now we find that the sixth sale
[2:27:18] has been opened Liberty
[2:27:22] to us
[2:27:24] we see it and we know that that's about
[2:27:28] what this is
[2:27:30] this seventh seal cannot be broke to the
[2:27:35] public
[2:27:37] is amen
[2:27:47] okay I mean
[2:27:49] that is that great
[2:27:52] seal okay
[2:27:55] and
[2:27:58] you know
[2:27:59] what how how was it revealed
[2:28:06] I I I I'm looking at this
[2:28:09] we we want Moses and Elijah here
[2:28:17] 's vision
[2:28:20] do I have the book here
[2:28:25] yes amen in this part mode vision

[2:28:51] foreign
[2:28:58] [Music]
[2:29:18] they were found by the Sea yeah
[2:29:23] all right amen now he took them
[2:29:29] you know the first thing when he met
[2:29:31] them fishing
[2:29:34] he said to them cast
[2:29:38] deeper
[2:29:43] and we realized that after that
[2:29:46] he also took them up to their highest
[2:29:49] mountain
[2:29:55] they could go deeper
[2:29:57] and they could go higher
[2:30:01] these three Witnesses
[2:30:06] amen amen
[2:30:10] the mission to go deeper
[2:30:12] was given to these three
[2:30:36] foreign Audi
[2:30:40] so surely they he equipped them
[2:30:45] now here it says
[2:30:50] notice before Jesus now now there
[2:30:54] appeared
[2:30:55] unto him Moses and Elijah
[2:31:02] these are the message just to
[2:31:05] the Jews today
[2:31:11] because we have three
[2:31:13] fold here
[2:31:16] then he says
[2:31:19] when it was open also
[2:31:23] it's under
[2:31:25] this threefold look how fast
[2:31:28] now we read here
[2:31:31] uh Moses it was Moses Elijah and Jesus
[2:31:40] on top of
[2:31:43] they were talking about
[2:31:47] Jerusalem
[2:31:50] what was the topic brother it is
[2:31:55] Luke chapter 9 verse 28 more Luca nine
[2:31:59] verse 28 and it came to pass about an
[2:32:02] eight days after this saint he took
[2:32:06] Peter and John and James and went up
[2:32:09] into a mountain to pray and as he played
[2:32:12] the fashion of his countenance was
[2:32:14] altered and his Remnant was white and
[2:32:17] glistering and behold they talked with
[2:32:19] him two men which were Moses and
[2:32:22] Alliance who appeared in glory and spake
[2:32:25] of his disease which he should
[2:32:27] accomplish at Jerusalem amen amen
[2:32:30] the three were already talking about
[2:32:33] their mission to Jerusalem
[2:32:38] and you know in Jerusalem
[2:32:41] there came Moses
[2:32:49] and the the the spirit of Elijah
[2:32:55] from the Gentiles
[2:32:58] the Gentiles
[2:33:03] who was now in a dream
[2:33:06] he says it was a joke even with that
[2:33:10] Elijah only the spirit
[2:33:13] from off the gentleness
[2:33:20] that is the same Spirit
[2:33:31] then it was in John the Baptist
[2:33:35] it is going now to this man he says it
[2:33:40] will be a joke
[2:33:45] for to introduce Jesus the Messiah
[2:33:49] through the Jews
[2:33:54] now that's why when they were standing
[2:33:56] here on the mountains
[2:33:58] they were discussing that yeah
[2:34:02] have men
[2:34:04] what they were it was all topic about
[2:34:08] Jerusalem
[2:34:11] because they will appear there
[2:34:14] well before the tribulation periods
[2:34:18] God will visit his
[2:34:21] people
[2:34:22] the Jews and you know how we went
[2:34:26] through it yeah they will go through the
[2:34:30] 144 000.
[2:34:32] we'll go through the tribulation period
[2:34:37] amen amen but then they've got their
[2:34:41] place after that

[3:01:20] in the book
[3:01:25] you know that the sons of God will be
[3:01:30] Gods
[3:01:33] amen have you read that amen

[3:02:40] sons of God will you be manifested
[3:02:46] and they will take from Satan but
[3:02:49] culture
[3:02:57] he made you a son
[3:03:01] but Satan when he murdered the plan of
[3:03:04] God
[3:03:05] God could not be defeated
[3:03:09] amen there's a law of restoration
[3:03:16] that's why there was a gap left there
[3:03:20] and when he was coming Adam
[3:03:25] I don't God
[3:03:30] not meaning that God did not see him
[3:03:34] but I don't see you in your position
[3:03:40] I don't see you in your post
[3:03:44] because
[3:03:46] that's like a mirror to God um
[3:04:01] I mean I mean now for all these ages and
[3:04:05] so forth
[3:04:07] the struggle Katana is to bring Adam
[3:04:11] back you wish each other
[3:04:14] or eternity will run again
[3:04:18] [Music]
[3:04:19] when Adam is

[3:04:25] when Adam is
[3:04:42] amen amen what was it foreign
[3:05:13] Haiti
[3:05:31] when he spoke of the squirrels
[3:05:34] a place where there's no squirrels
[3:05:37] and talking about
[3:05:41] sister
[3:06:02] [Music]
[3:06:17] foreign
[3:06:24] blood
[3:06:33] [Music]
[3:06:38] amen amen amen among all those days
[3:07:03] um
[3:07:07] did you hear that
[3:07:11] sister
[3:07:14] she didn't say that from me
[3:07:22] amen
[3:07:27] very meaningless
[3:07:30] Peter Petro who do men say that I the
[3:07:34] son of man
[3:07:35] [Music]
[3:07:38] yeah
[3:07:41] and the same applied to Peter limo Petro
[3:07:47] Pedro you didn't see it from here
[3:07:52] I mean I mean my father
[3:07:57] you are blessed because
[3:08:00] my father daddy chose you oh Haiti
[3:08:05] and my father Tate spoke through you
[3:08:09] know the answer came from God
[3:08:16] amen amen that's right the message
[3:08:25] came from the father
[3:08:27] um
[3:08:34] is that right now which one before we
[3:08:37] close here listening
[3:08:41] how God revealed himself here
[3:08:45] [Music]
[3:08:47] he Reveals His church
[3:08:51] have you never have you ever heard of
[3:08:54] the revealed Church
[3:08:59] that's why when it is revealed it is
[3:09:01] called the bride now
[3:09:05] I mean not just a change I think like a
[3:09:08] friend that one you can't start
[3:09:12] as the people can come together and say
[3:09:14] okay let's start our movement yeah
[3:09:19] we will be our pastor
[3:09:22] no this one is the revealed
[3:09:26] [Music]
[3:09:27] his body it's his body
[3:09:30] he was revealed
[3:09:33] amen amen the members are part of the
[3:09:37] threefolds
[3:09:42] in this body amen
[3:09:54] have we started a church no
[3:09:58] no one has the blood to stop yourself
[3:10:04] some people sometimes they end up in the
[3:10:06] court of law
[3:10:08] saying I started
[3:10:13] amen amen
[3:10:16] you if you say you start the church do
[3:10:20] you have that blood now
[3:10:24] because it takes the blood of God to
[3:10:28] start a church
[3:10:43] it is a change but it's human change
[3:10:47] the next time they break again
[3:10:51] out of that human change
[3:10:58] that's why it's the place is littered
[3:11:01] with churches
[3:11:05] hail
[3:11:46] among virgins
[3:11:52] then the prophet of God tells me I love
[3:11:56] this Prophet
[3:11:58] you know it was the word
[3:12:00] that came to Mary
[3:12:03] and Mary said I am just a
[3:12:11] before this was born this one was born
[3:12:16] Joseph Joseph was set aside
[3:12:24] it should not be the blood of Jesus
[3:12:29] it should be the blood of God
[3:12:33] now Joseph was set aside
[3:12:37] the wake of the Lord was done
[3:12:45] let me repeat to you who didn't
[3:12:48] foreign
[3:12:55] then the prophet of God says You must
[3:12:59] listen to the prophet
[3:13:01] always I mean I mean that's why the
[3:13:04] people who do not listen to the prophets
[3:13:07] they start what they call message
[3:13:11] churches
[3:13:13] I don't know of any messages
[3:13:21] then you visit these messages
[3:13:26] that might differ
[3:13:29] a woman I met at me
[3:13:33] the place of my brother-in-laws
[3:13:40] this one is
[3:13:43] and she says
[3:13:47] I also used to accompany my pasta
[3:13:51] everywhere
[3:13:54] and the next thing there was a rumor
[3:13:57] about him
[3:14:02] foreign
[3:14:06] I said okay okay
[3:14:09] the problem
[3:14:10] here is
[3:14:13] you say you followed the pastor
[3:14:16] now the Bible says we believe the Lord
[3:14:20] said Murano really come unto me
[3:14:26] that is the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:14:29] you remember he said talking to this
[3:14:33] woman
[3:14:36] I will build my church
[3:14:41] and it takes his blood what's your body
[3:14:45] around do that
[3:14:46] and the gates over here
[3:14:52] shall never Prevail because
[3:14:59] I said do you know of this one
[3:15:02] you know of the pastor
[3:15:06] amen amen and you drop off the light
[3:15:09] but there is this one of
[3:15:13] of the master the Lord
[3:15:19] I will build my church
[3:15:23] and the gates of Hades
[3:15:27] never because
[3:15:34] where is that church
[3:15:38] it's called The Bride today
[3:15:45] [Music]
[3:15:47] gbr It Is by
[3:15:50] I think it's x-20 yeah
[3:15:53] but of the blood of God Amen
[3:16:00] the ministry
[3:16:03] if you have received this ministry this
[3:16:06] word of God
[3:16:07] it is the blood of God
[3:16:10] Amen when it
[3:16:13] as the prophet says when he receives she
[3:16:17] received that weight by Gabriel
[3:16:22] then that word
[3:16:26] by Gabriel he realized in her womb
[3:16:34] I mean a son was born amen
[3:16:40] godimu gave birth to him his own son
[3:16:47] it was God
[3:16:49] is
[3:16:54] amen but now I I'm finishing here now
[3:17:00] everything is going back now
[3:17:04] amen amen
[3:17:06] as everything is going back while I'm
[3:17:09] around God under the law of restoration
[3:17:12] uh
[3:17:15] he showed to me when
[3:17:20] he brought
[3:17:21] brother Branham
[3:17:25] then I could see that one hour
[3:17:28] with brother Brennan Brothers
[3:17:43] did you know why the sword was given to
[3:17:46] brother Brandon Brothers
[3:17:53] because
[3:17:59] restoration
[3:18:04] if it was in the end
[3:18:07] like Adam
[3:18:11] he forfeited the book
[3:18:13] that's why
[3:18:15] after the battle camera the Lord Jesus
[3:18:20] has won the battle offended and became
[3:18:24] wealthy yeah
[3:18:30] it was not in the library
[3:18:33] it was not just a book a very simple fan
[3:18:36] to be opened by any person oh
[3:18:42] there was a battle
[3:18:44] in the Lord fought
[3:18:48] when he was crucified he was not in
[3:18:52] danger
[3:18:58] amen
[3:19:01] amen amen because the Lord Jesus Christi
[3:19:08] he didn't fear what men
[3:19:10] could do
[3:19:13] it's it's himself who has planned that
[3:19:17] crucifixion
[3:19:23] [Music]
[3:19:26] he has chosen the way of the Cross
[3:19:31] himself
[3:19:40] he came to the cross that was his Plan
[3:19:44] of Redemption
[3:19:48] is that right now which one amen amen he
[3:19:52] was the master
[3:19:57] that's why he said father forgive them
[3:19:59] they don't know what they do
[3:20:02] I have planned it to be this way
[3:20:07] amen amen
[3:20:12] for to save my people tomorrow
[3:20:18] you know that song
[3:20:22] amen amen when they came to get some
[3:20:26] money
[3:20:31] where is
[3:20:38] Timothy he could have called
[3:20:43] Ten Thousand Angels amen amen amen
[3:20:49] but she died alone
[3:20:54] amen amen he said don't you know I can
[3:20:58] call Angels here
[3:21:02] but because the scripture must be
[3:21:05] fulfilled
[3:21:07] take me
[3:21:11] so as for to fulfill the scriptures
[3:21:16] [Music]
[3:21:17] he didn't need a lawyer or a lawyer
[3:21:21] it was his own act eventually
[3:21:27] to be here this
[3:21:29] afternoon
[3:21:39] amen amen amen his weed in you
[3:21:43] is The Blood come back amen amen the
[3:21:49] blood that became the way that became

[3:22:04] and became weird yeah

[3:33:38] four three four is somebody there
[3:33:40] [Music]
[3:33:43] okay and that's why it's not made known
[3:33:47] to everybody
[3:33:55] you belong to the three foreign
[3:34:20] amen amen amen hey
[3:34:25] now I will lose you with a happy heart
[3:34:28] heavily
[3:34:32] is it
[3:34:33] the next where's the next one yeah
[3:34:38] the next page
[3:34:46] Christ is the mystery of God no Christ
[3:34:49] The Mystery of God revealed revealed
[3:34:54] yeah the threefold mystery of God
[3:34:58] so you are part
[3:35:01] of that oh mystery
[3:35:05] amen Christ is the mystery of God
[3:35:08] foreign
[3:36:02] uh
[3:36:03] it is here that is Page
[3:36:06] page 21 page
[3:36:09] 31.21. amen
[3:36:14] is that my time brother
[3:36:17] is this my time
[3:36:19] my today's day okay okay no problem
[3:36:23] where is he paragraph one three nine
[3:36:27] yeah no page 21 plus page 21 21 oh yeah
[3:36:31] yeah why why I'm remaining here also it
[3:36:36] says
[3:36:37] now in revealing the uh in revealing the
[3:36:43] mystery of God
[3:36:45] he was God's threefold peoples
[3:36:50] for the church
[3:36:54] right I mean you must keep the threefold
[3:36:57] because when the Revelation is revealed
[3:36:59] it will only reflect
[3:37:02] therefore
[3:37:04] okay amen now
[3:37:08] because Calvin remember that
[3:37:12] you ask a person why you say it was not
[3:37:16] revealed where the Prophet says
[3:37:27] let me remind you of something here
[3:37:31] it was not revealed
[3:37:35] you see but it was opened it was but not
[3:37:39] revealed to the public
[3:37:44] it was revealed to the messenger
[3:37:48] not to the public
[3:37:50] because he said
[3:37:53] just remain worshiping God
[3:37:56] do all that is right
[3:38:00] and God
[3:38:01] would you just carry on right on
[3:38:03] and God him will take care of their rest
[3:38:08] yeah
[3:38:12] that's why people were confused when it
[3:38:14] said
[3:38:15] even the angels
[3:38:22] because now when the sun comes in
[3:38:26] when the substitute leaves they
[3:38:29] substitute people then it is time for
[3:38:32] the sun to come in
[3:38:34] because the sun the sun was no Jesus the
[3:38:40] sun was Adam
[3:38:43] Luke chapter 3 tells you
[3:38:45] which was the Sun God was the god of the
[3:38:49] of the universe but Adam was the god of
[3:38:54] God the earthing of the earth
[3:38:59] oh my it is in your spoken word I mean
[3:39:03] all right I mean he was
[3:39:05] God it says he was irrebelling God Amen
[3:39:10] the headquarters of Adam was the Garden
[3:39:13] of him
[3:39:15] headquarters of God
[3:39:19] now it was hidden the headquarters of
[3:39:22] God and
[3:39:24] foreign
[3:39:35] God
[3:39:43] he said that's as far as we go
[3:39:49] I trust that each and every one of you
[3:39:53] will serve God and do which is that
[3:39:57] which is right and love him all your
[3:40:01] life life
[3:40:06] and God will take care of the arrests
[3:40:13] amen but
[3:40:15] you should follow it he omitted
[3:40:20] the the revelation of the seventh seals
[3:40:26] and yeah when the seventh seal when you
[3:40:29] open it he also omitted each other
[3:40:33] see so we see that it is in a complete
[3:40:38] mystery
[3:40:41] the hour is not yet for this mystery to
[3:40:47] be known
[3:40:55] and the rest of it
[3:40:58] will be no because if I repeat
[3:41:03] right around about the time
[3:41:08] what is happening now
[3:41:12] amen amen
[3:41:14] I'm closing by saying
[3:41:20] I have now received what God has
[3:41:22] promised here
[3:41:26] amen I won't talk about your own
[3:41:29] spiritual experience
[3:41:32] I have seen it
[3:41:34] I have received
[3:41:38] said to be the rest of it
[3:41:43] now I've seen it the rest of it and he
[3:41:49] says
[3:41:52] the rest of it will be known
[3:41:57] right around about the time that Jesus
[3:42:01] appears
[3:42:05] for his bride
[3:42:08] before he can take his pride
[3:42:12] of mysteries
[3:42:16] he has to bring their branches
[3:42:20] what to pay now because the price is
[3:42:23] part of his threefold Mysteries
[3:42:32] is the mystery of God in a three-fold
[3:42:39] I'm not struggling to be ruptured
[3:42:42] I'm just part of the threefolds
