Description:
Title: The White Stone Interpretation Vol.7
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 29 March 2024.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Revelation 2:17
Revelation 19:11-14
Revelation 21:9

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the White stone interpretation.
If you go back to the Church ages, you are going to be continuing with repetition. If you are still residing in the time of the churches, you are not in line with the revelation of God, according to the word of God, the Seventh Seal was revealed and you cannot impersonate it.

If the Lord Jesus Christ don’t appear on Instagram, his Child will never appear on Instagram. As a children of God we don’t want to see ourselves, we want to see Him.  
Show us the cross, show us the seals that is our way of going back home. If you are from God, God will show you the way back home.
This ministry of the Seventh Seal it is God speaking to his children, who have no hatred, they have seen something better. 
The people he has spoken to and answered, they are the ones who can see the things that are happening today. 
The message that we preach was not heard from here, it was put aside for certain time for certain people. 
The only people who receive the message not just teaching but life, the message are the people who heard him. The Seventh Seal message is the message for the people who have heard from their Theophany. The Prophet says you have heard from your Theophany, he didn’t say you h...

don't you know of the that is in the Bible okay amen we'll come and show you in the Bible okay amen well as we bow our heads where our Elder we say prayer let us pray gracious Lord once again father it is through your mercy that we could bow our heads with Holiness in our heart Holiness of the full weight that has been revealed and Lord Almighty in the time that we are living in we just sang a song that said I'll be ready yes Lord being Overcomers we we are already ready Lord knowing that you came to the Jews Lord Almighty to manifest the word and Lord Almighty you are you are in us now the Gentiles to manifest that word now the manifested word Lord is within us Lord and as we are about to read that word there's our pastor Lord behind the P pit gracious Heavenly Father we know that you have anointed him and we know Lord Almighty that you have Sanctified him to bring that word we are always happy Lord Almighty to know that you descended from eternity having that book Lord Almighty that Pillar of Fire Lord and gave it to the prophet and father the prophet giving to a man behind the pull pit father we believe that because even Paul gracious heavenly father said we should believe them and love them Lord Almighty even our Prophet said we should pray for them Lord father we pray for our pastor Lord Almighty believing that Lord is a vessel that is going to teach the W today Lord May our hearts Lord Almighty be open because you once said to the Pharisees they hate you they want to kill you because there is no place in their heart Lord for your word Lord Believers coming from different places Lord open their hearts Lord Almighty that this word must find a place in their heart father thank you Father as we are about to read it and as the pastor is about to preach about it Lord Almighty may we have that Revelation Lord Almighty thank you Father binding all the evil spirits the devil and his angels Lord Almighty because Lord Almighty we have power the revealed word has given us power to cast him out we are here as Believers without any devil we don't need any demon here Lord Almighty but we know that that has already been taking place Lord your word has been taking place Lord thank you Father take control Lord of everything here in the precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ amen Lord amen amen May SE we are thankful amen I was we have to read was that yeah we

mention her name even now I won't B but she said she's experiencing something every time she see fire then he said now since now the Rapture is coming and and I'm looking at you and I see this thing time and [Music] again fire fire fire then I contined to tell her that it's not fire like this one we have even the prophet says sometimes we will b a billion years or what but it wouldn't be an eternal thing because only only the Christians have got eternal life amen amen amen now my Prophet say yes there is hell he says it can take millions of years somebody burning but it is not Eternal it Millions orli years amen amen since ever Judas went down the bottomless he's still rolling now this Sister Sister of yesterday is it yesterday or day before yesterday I don't know she said one time but what is that cycle of darkness and I said where she says I've seen it and then I said did you ask the elders there or whosoever responsible you that what is it we are not allowed to ask any [Music] question if they don't tell you about it don't try to ask now I I I said to her you know do you know about the bottomless pit terrible okay amen a pit of darkness and the people today they just don't care they don't know what is Hell only if they knew they would run to the Lord Jesus Christ only if you can know what is you will run to the Lord Jesus Christ all right am we'll come to that H waiting for of over all places just count them mention them Jerusalem Jerusalem Bethlehem bethleem amen amen hey it's going to be a big that meeting in that meeting Paul will be phip will beer will be [Music] there amen [Applause] oh we [Applause] is so amen [Music] amen over to D Amen to Revelation Chapter 2 amen verse 17 he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit sayith unto the churches Amen to him that overcometh will I give to it of the Hidden man and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written amen which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen is that one scripture or two two okay revelation 19: 11-13 and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself amen and he was clothed with a vest dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God Amen you may be seated God bless you uh that piece of I had a a piece of paper here from the brother a piece of paper that was no okay I think it is okay I will find it the piece of paper uh with the quotations that I ask for now I don't see no it's bigger than that one God bless you all right all right now we are we are here again this morning we are thankful to God the when we live we will find ourselves in Le there's a pastor there amen amen so they have arranged for us okay anyhow it's not time for the to report about this things now we all know about them we we'll be going there all right amen um last we ask a question about the Battle of amagon I wonder this who are asking talking about under under don't they know what is the underworld they don't know okay do they know about the coming of the battle of no all right amen but today I will read for few few minutes here about the just to finish up some part of [Music] this amen amen and that one it is very impossible to impersonate because impersonation is everywhere now the reason being that uh John Wason to come up and the prophet told us that was after the seven Church ages I mean he he has seen the seven chur amen because you can only be suon up after you have seen because seven churches speak of time amen amen now he was someon to come up after he has seen the time he seen that time of the church ages because uh if you uh we are going back you are going back to the church ages you are only going to continue with a [Music] reputation but as the prophet said the seventh seal is the end of the time of all things amen amen amen and there's some people that are still waiting for the revelation of the seventh season but we'll come with that show that seven seal was revealed but if you are still residing in churches time of the churches amen amen you are not in line with the revelation of God because according to the word of God the seven seal which we will come will read some things and to show that the seven seal is was revealed amen let's wait for that we are we are talking about it every day but only you cannot impersonate amen that's why the prophet said John the message came to John and said come up and I will show you to to come now if you are told that you hear that word I will show you things to come meaning the past will remain the past meaning there there's another he says I'll show you that things that say it all right here Amen brother you remember even 20 Page I mean chapter 21 21 amen uh let me make sure that I'm trying to C the right thing amen it say where it says come up that was joh and I will show you the bride Revelation 21 yes verse 9 and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God Amen okay amen I will show you the bride it is himself who introduced the bride and even here I am glad to worship because I heard him introducing the bride who is the bride of Christ I'm not talking about the message Church talking about the amen amen so the bride has the weight as my Prophet says she is Alpha and Omega now Alpha and Omega that is the wife of Christ yeah all right amen did you read that amen no and he says also the bride comes twice amen all right amen and uh that's why now we are not in a miss Mage church because the so churches some even they hate one another that can't be the the bride of Christ is like Christ amen amen and she doesn't impersonate she she's receiving from the husband that's why he said be therefore am amen if God is Holy then he will be worshiped by a holy person amen if you are a child of God it says then you are like him if God doesn't tell lies his child cannot tell us amen if God can s son his child cannot s if the Lord Jesus Christ don't appear on more social mediaall more social media tell me that thing what is that brother if God don't appear on Instagram his child will never we as the children of God we don't want to see ourselves we want to see amen you know uh you remember that story told by a sister some years back said there was a young man who got lost he couldn't find his way back home now people were trying to help this young man to find her way back but we that's when I was at the Assemblies of God church when this mama told the story then it was a testimony she was giving then she said and uh this [Music] boy uh the police were trying to help him find his way back but when the news of this Lost Boy appear on the papers then they say another somebody offered to help then he went to I think it was police what what years back when she arrived as a woman when she arrived there she said I know this all right and they said okay tell us he this I saw him somewhere where he resides there's a sign of a cross there somewhere there and this boy started to say show me the cross he said show me the cross that cross then once I see that cross then I would have arrived amen amen amen that's how he happened to return that's why we are going back home show us the cross show us the seals that is our way back amen so we come we arrive at the sign after a sign all right amen and one thing if you you are from God then God will show you the way back home this ministry of the seven amen amen it is on the I can't say on the board okay but it is God to his children speaking to his children amen amen yes sir his children no hatred they have sh because they have seen something [Music] better you can only leave something after you have seen something better than okay amen uh I wake up early in the morning morning we are watching the signs amen amen some people don't care about what the Lord has said they ask him about the sign of his coming and he he said as it was in the time of as it was in the time of no so shall it be right amen and then the people he has spoken to they can see those signs but only those he has answered that it shall be like this now those people today they say or they are saying in their preachings and so forth this is what the Lord Jesus has spoken spoken about these things that they will happen in the end of time but others they don't care about that because he not talking to them the only people message who receives the message not just a teaching but life the message now do you know that these are the people that H him amen this seven seal message is the message of the people who haveen let me say to you again the Samaritan woman who told her that when when the Messiah comes he will tell us all things who told her that and brother say that woman and others they didn't say it from here okay before we close the message that we preach we didn't hear it from [Applause] here amen amen it is the message that God prepared for those who love him then said in the last days amen amen it's a message that was put aside am for a certain time for a certain people amen that's why I was reading even yesterday when the prophet said you have heard from you sit down and check that you have heard from your because your real body it's not this one not real body we will come to that to look at this bodies the prophet taugh me that and you he T you about it you have another body amen this this sister um yesterday she said she want me to she want to come she wants to come so that I can pray for her and she's talking about the people that are against but she says but you you have two bodies I said that means god is busy with this she said you've got two bodies and that's why I want to come to you to help me out all right am now if you have two bodies what does that mean because your theop is not preaching a church stuff and you're hearing is not that of a human being I'll bring it the prophet spoke about that about your hearing we can read the same thing and only that one and that one will [Music] understand if a person don't understand it means you have spoken to you have spoken to that person something let me put it right as the prophet says you have heard from your okay amen he didn't say you hear because you are educated education is not a of the world that's why the people people today who boast of their education they are misleading the people if they come to church uh this money what money ritual money ritual but the preaching oh oh Prosperity Prosperity Prosperity Prosperity Prosperity is preached by educated people all right amen uh the seventh seal if they say you have received the seventh seal that mean you have finished the course that's right amen now we don't receive the word through Reading no you receive from God then you read about [Applause] it why Peter said H after some of the people they left Jesus the Jesus and they said I who can hear his preaching so they went but Peter said where shall we go now when we live the service right now some people are taking different directions where are you going brother Bram says if you once you hit seven then what where are you going all right am because if you hit seven that's def Finishing Line okay amen like today we are just waiting for the Rapture I don't know about you but with me I I'm just waiting for the rupture I don't see any other thing I don't see the world some that this world will offer me something amen amen you know if you can see in the evening towards the evening I used to sit and watch the bab no one can keep time like the we have WR watches and so forth but still we can't keep TI but that bed has no rest watch but it can keep tight amen amen did you see that amen every day I used to watch them this time will pass at a certain certain time you'll see them together amen amen now they are not churches no they have heard him speak now they follow him every day you see them going this way tomorrow again they come this way they go back again like that amen it is almost like like us all right amen we are here but we don't belong here is that right amen that's why we go to the service just to go we are not church goers a church goer is a person who comes to church and go back with hey the church was so nice amen amen that's that far but a predestinated seed one Simon speak to H him the things he has experienced in his [Music] theop theop not this B is not this big head that's why he says you have heard from [Music] it's nothing it's something amen amen hearing there's different kinds of you'll see when we will we shall come to read where the Prophet says H if you go beyond the dimensions dims you hear the brother singing that song changing yeah changing Dimensions amen yes amen mhm amen changing Dimensions Dimension because you will only stuck somewhere if you go with somebody who loves beer or Marana and you arrive the people drinking it's easy to lose him amen amen I'm coming [Music] back but a child of God let me tell you something amen didn't the Bible say uh we I'm still coming to the White Stone the B says he who hates his brother let me repeat he who hates his brother he who hates his sister [Music] sister what's the answer he is like he he's talking about a person like if he says K the first man to kill was now if it says he who hates his brother he doesn't say he hates because [Music] of no he says he is like the original killer is that right amen okay amen now let us continue for few minutes that's why I was reading even recently the day of redemption okay amen and the people are preaching it the day of redemption of redemption amen amen but which day is this we don't do you have a calendar that tells you that the day of redemption is on such and such a day amen amen and where the people will start running to and through uh trying to make things right you will never that's why the Lord Jesus knowing that we couldn't redeem ourselves he came himself without sin to shed his blood and he knew that the only gospel will come through blood because the blood of Jesus that's why he's a Kingsman and it says we were Redeemed by whom all [Music] right I said Dad people were wondering why now it seems like Pastor is making Jesus our friend now because it says brother because they say what a friend I have am in Jesus people can hate you the whole world but as long as you have Jesus amen amen it won't bother you if you have Jesus as your friend then you own all you have all because in Jesus we have found all that's why they say Give Me Jesus and that's enough for me I need I don't need Jesus end he is everything he's everything he's everything to me he he everything to me he my father my sister my father and my mother he everything to me amen [Applause] amen naturally I can't show you somebody and say this is my blood brother do you know my family I mean in this way have you seen my father my mother or you've just seen her but where is where is [Music] she do you know she's not with me if I say my [Music] I have my mother passed on is that right amen now but I have something Eternal that cannot pass away and God made it he made it this way if talking about the Kingman Redeemer this Gospel of the seals it makes you one with God the whole world can leave you amen but the king man cannot leave you that's why he came shed his blood and he it is impossible for God to leave [Applause] you amen amen amen because you are Of The Bloodline the person of the blood line is not forced to do anything that's why the the prophet of God says your pro your theop you have heard before you have heard it doesn't say you are going to hear no that means what is preached to you you have already had amen amen am that's why if the way comes to you is just amen that's and you you you are not struggling to do the will of God no because your is the will of God amen amen you know I we read the books especially uh those who know me they know even I I sometimes I don't sleep or I sleep early in the morning even even today early in the morning all right why because a real Christian reads his [Music] Bible he read spoken spoken spoken when you come preach by Revelation he but can you hear what he says because he says you have heard that's why you hear amen you remember that part we have read he speaks about the fourth dimension you know radios all amen amen of which the children of today they are not going anywhere unless by predestination because of these things that are happening you won't even find a child because the moment they start to hear they hear these things of the world Amen amen amen amen now that's why the true Christianity is something you have heard amen amen that's why he says you have heard from your now if somebody comes with something different you don't hear him or her because you have heard from your now I will tell you that I'll keep this one I have heard from my theop because theop is light and the that's God in plural amen that's why he says this body the is subject to the word of God Amen all right amen there's something in you pulling you every time you want to read the Bible the spoken way inside there is something pulling you something is pulling you amen waiting for the Rapture is not like waiting at the bus stop you have Peter why you are still remaining While others have left Lord where shall we go you know your chrisan should arrive at that place without this word where shall I go because that is his or her place she has from the the Samaritan woman do you know that when Messiah come he will tell us she has H from [Music] her Peter also said Lord where shall we go because it is in theop if it is in your theop you are just like Peter there's no other place for you even if you can go all of you but the person who has hit from the will remain Lord where shall we go for the words of eternal life with you amen the king's man that's why I I have this here hold that word Redemption until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed meaning that the day of redemption until that's what the prophet said that day of remp redemption let me start Redemption until the day that book of redemption is revealed amen amen who has the wa Redemption because I'm cling he's he's reading this grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until he that's why when you come you can't get lost because when the boy was lost but when when he met that Mama that Mama mentioned the cross amen amen let me say while closing here Christ is your King's [Music] man is your King's man you remember brother [Music] when Princess Diana died yes I said that uh there was [Music] news amen amen big news because she wasen a queen no there was another a newspaper that came out with certain news there's somebody who were uh recording from that house of the the Royal house then he said now they said those who received the news from this men who who went to the Royal house it was on the newspaper d h what do you say about it inside what about inside the report from the right it says it was written like that a report from the inside today we need a report from the Insiders the family man he was born there he of the blood life now that's why we need to hear we have a redeemer who is not just a redeemer but he is an Insider he is one of us that's why we couldn't be saved by any other blood should be the blood of the king that makes us one with him amen all right that's why when they come they say where shall I go amen Peter there's so many places you can go to Dubai but he had nowhere to go because the blood of the Kings man makes makes him also to be K with him all right amen now that's why we can't go anywhere why I want to hear from the king's [Music] [Applause] man the family men amen amen there's so many even today churches are full up to pakist Pak things like that but where shall I go you that you don't belong to a [Music] church but you are King to the king man amen amen he's not coming to choose we were chosen before before you appeared before you you were born he has chosen you already how by his [Applause] blood amen hey he has chosen You by his blood so that have you seen siblings amen amen siblings of the same bloodline together have you seen when they live together this one will defend this one even if he is wrong [Music] he something like this your brother oh somebody and do somebody meet your brother slap your brother the first thing you what are you doing to my younger brother you're already in judg but you haven't heard why is he slepping [Music] amen amen I don't want to hear anything now the blood line of Christ is not like that that's why now I'm glad I am [Music] redeemed amen if you are not redeemed you just become a church member and when they redeemed started to bring things that brought them up according to the bloodline you say now you see they [Music] started amen amen we were talking brother and together with the brothers it is like that I've seen one of God when I was still at Assemblies of God now a child does something wrong and when they trying to discipline him even the parents know that brother this brother has wronged their son now the real is the love of God Amen among yourself love among each other this sister loves this one and hat this amen love God is love we together it's it's surprising hey I used to go with some brothers we were a group and you singing amen amen so there was one who was close to me every now you always brother I'm I'm happy that going to talk we are

stand to our amen hey the gates will open so that I may enter in he purchased my salvation all right amen now G have seen that gates are being opened the seven seal another gate all the revelations that God has blessed us with we we go through the game amen am people can talk but when God speaks to you it's something else amen [Applause] amen they were saying he's still the same Jesus he Remains the Same that's why I will always stay with him because he's always the same man can do this today tomorrow he's taking another route child of God will never never take another road once he is pred because he is predestinated amen amen you know brother coming to church I just wear because I'm coming to church I can go naked but I don't work for the people no I wear because I must put on
