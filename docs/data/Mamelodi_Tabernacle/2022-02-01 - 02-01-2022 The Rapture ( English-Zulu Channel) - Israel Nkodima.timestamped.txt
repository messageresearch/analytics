[47:19] yes and the father we know and we
[47:21] believe
[47:23] that the father surely will address us
[47:25] also this morning
[47:28] because the father we thank you for the
[47:30] light
[47:31] that lord you have given to the pride
[47:35] because the seven messenger lord is
[47:37] saying that lord yes there was a full
[47:40] light from the first age church
[47:44] but in that light lord
[47:46] it went lord
[47:48] going down
[47:50] it was lost because father of the teeth
[47:52] of the nicolaitans
[47:55] and the father it went down also to the
[47:57] second father age
[48:00] to the third age to the fourth age but
[48:02] on the fifth age it started to go
[48:04] up and when it went up further on the
[48:08] sixth edge it went even more up
[48:11] it went up further also in the laudician
[48:15] church
[48:16] but further all of a sudden lord
[48:19] it went down again amen
[48:22] at the moment where we are father there
[48:24] is darkness lord in the church
[48:27] but the father there is a light in your
[48:29] pride
[48:30] [Music]
[48:32] he said father this darkness lord
[48:36] it was also prophesied by the eclipse
[48:40] which is the seventh stage of eclipse
[48:43] that went totally dark in darkness
[48:45] further
[48:47] in this age
[48:48] he said their pope
[48:51] who is paul vi which the number six is
[48:54] the number of a man
[48:56] he went visited
[48:57] jerusalem for at all
[49:00] and the father it was the first time for
[49:02] the pope to visit
[49:04] and that has caused the darkness father
[49:07] in the church
[49:08] but the father we have to thank the lord
[49:11] that even if it is so lord
[49:14] thank you for the light that we have
[49:15] beyond the tunnel
[49:17] thank you father for the
[49:19] angel of the church lord that what you
[49:21] sure
[49:23] who is standing father behind the pulpit
[49:26] who is bringing that light father
[49:29] it can be dark to the church but father
[49:31] there is a light in the planet
[49:34] and the father will have to thank you
[49:35] for the word
[49:37] that the father is coming because the
[49:39] bible says
[49:40] jesus managed to overcome satan through
[49:43] the word
[49:44] yes because father he was so obedient to
[49:47] the word of his father
[49:50] even further at this time lord
[49:52] for the pride to manage to overcome the
[49:54] devil
[49:56] we need to have a word we need to be
[49:57] taught that with the world
[49:59] so that we can overcome the tougher
[50:02] the only thing that can overcome further
[50:05] development is to have a word
[50:07] and to be obedient into a weight amen
[50:10] now father we've got the servant we've
[50:12] got the man of god with us
[50:14] he's bringing that word father he's
[50:16] bringing that sword lord

[50:37] we know that lord is always protected we
[50:40] know that the father
[50:41] the devil father doesn't like him
[50:44] and we don't like you either you devil
[50:47] because in the name of the lord jesus
[50:49] the seven messenger
[50:50] he's saying father when we are facing
[50:52] you devil there is no need for fasting
[50:55] and prayer
[50:57] but is to rebuke you in the name of
[50:58] jesus
[51:00] is to tell you where to get off

[51:42] brother
[51:44] let us visit enoch again
[51:50] we'll take it from there
[51:53] because what happened there is happening
[51:56] here
[52:00] we started with
[52:02] abraham
[52:05] for with abraham it said
[52:08] as it was
[52:12] in the days of abraham
[52:14] so shall it be in our day
[52:19] what did it mean
[52:22] in the days of abraham
[52:25] god came to abraham as a man
[52:30] called
[52:35] amen
[52:37] now it says
[52:39] at the end of time
[52:42] it will repeat again
[52:46] but
[52:47] to the seed
[52:49] of abraham
[52:51] and the seed of abraham
[52:55] after
[52:56] you are through with that
[52:58] i will read it
[53:01] amen
[53:03] genesis chapter 5 verse 24
[53:08] and enoch walked with god and he was not
[53:12] for god took him
[53:20] you remember the second one
[53:22] amen
[53:24] jude
[53:25] verse 14
[53:29] and it and enoch also the seventh from
[53:32] adam prophesied of his sayings
[53:35] behold the lord cometh with ten
[53:38] thousands of his saints
[53:40] to execute judgment upon all and to
[53:44] convince all that are ungodly among them
[53:48] of all their ungodly deeds which they
[53:50] have ungodly committed
[53:53] and of all their heart speeches
[53:55] which and god listeners have spoken
[53:58] against him
[53:59] these are mammars complainers
[54:02] walking after their own lust and their
[54:05] mouths speak of great swelling with
[54:07] having men's persons in admiration
[54:11] because of advantage
[54:14] you may be seated god bless you
[54:19] galatians
[54:22] chapter 3 verse 16 says
[54:26] now to abraham and his
[54:29] seed where the promises made
[54:37] did you hear it
[54:39] to abram and his
[54:42] seed
[54:46] i read where the men of god said like
[54:50] this that is the church ages
[54:54] he said
[54:56] we were seed in order to be born again
[55:04] [Music]
[55:07] if you know the law
[55:10] only you take the seed
[55:14] you plant it
[55:16] it will come forth
[55:18] amen and
[55:21] it will
[55:22] reproduce
[55:24] of its kind
[55:29] and then
[55:30] next time
[55:32] you'll take the seed from the seed
[55:35] [Music]
[55:37] and plant it
[55:39] it will continue to bring of its kind
[55:45] never really change for something else
[55:47] along the way
[55:51] and it will remain a seed a seed a seed
[55:55] a seed
[55:57] throughout the ages
[56:01] i mean
[56:02] because
[56:03] it has got life in it
[56:07] now that's why it says to
[56:10] abraham and his
[56:12] seed
[56:15] where
[56:16] the promise is made
[56:21] you know that's why
[56:23] today you can look around and say
[56:26] abraham has a seat
[56:28] [Applause]
[56:30] is the seed of abraham today
[56:34] amen
[56:35] because of his seed

[56:42] so he said he should meet melchizedek
[56:47] if he is the seed of abraham
[56:51] amen
[56:53] not a churchgoer
[56:56] now the abraham and his seed were the
[56:59] promises made
[57:02] [Music]
[57:05] he said not and to
[57:08] to cease
[57:09] as of
[57:10] many but as one
[57:14] and to thy seed which is
[57:18] say it which is
[57:20] amen
[57:23] the seed is christ
[57:27] christ is the anointing
[57:31] that's why it says jesus the anointed
[57:37] jesus the christ
[57:40] all right

[57:48] the seventh man from
[57:51] adam that's how it is registered
