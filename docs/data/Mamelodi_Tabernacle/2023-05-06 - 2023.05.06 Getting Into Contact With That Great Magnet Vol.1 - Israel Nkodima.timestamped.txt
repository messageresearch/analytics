[7:22] amen
[7:23] and we will open the scriptures
[7:29] um
[7:30] we I think let's
[7:34] go back to that scripture again
[7:39] Genesis chapter 4 again this is chapter
[7:42] 4 verse 18 I believe is 20.
[7:50] Genesis chapter 14.
[7:52] from Verse 18 to 20. yes sir
[7:55] fourteen
[7:57] and Melchizedek king of Salem brought
[8:00] forth Bread and Wine
[8:02] and he was the priest of the most high
[8:04] God
[8:05] and he blessed him and said Blessed Be
[8:08] Abram of the most high god possessor of
[8:11] Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most
[8:14] high God which hath delivered thine
[8:16] enemies in into thine hand and he gave
[8:19] him tithes of all
[8:25] verse 8.
[8:29] and this is Chapter 14 verse 18.
[8:34] um
[8:39] [Music]
[8:48] [Music]
[8:59] God bless you may be seated
[9:03] all right
[9:07] okay here we
[9:10] we are for
[9:12] some
[9:14] few but the spiritual meaning
[9:21] we've been going through this
[9:25] book about the Melchizedek yes attack
[9:31] under
[9:34] I think
[9:36] you are acquainted with it here
[9:40] amen amen
[9:42] and
[9:44] that king of Salem
[9:48] so we're going to read
[9:51] some show because
[9:54] we've been going through this
[9:56] Melchizedek because
[10:00] um
[10:01] he has no beginning and The New Ending
[10:03] is
[10:10] but you know last time we read where it
[10:13] says when
[10:15] she met Abraham he was Melchizedek
[10:18] yesterday
[10:23] I think I'm I'll be
[10:26] preaching to the seed of
[10:29] Abraham
[10:33] and the Seed of Abraham is Christ
[10:37] now Christ has got no beginning
[10:40] Christiano
[10:43] amen amen and then he
[10:47] has no beginning
[10:54] and
[10:55] it's a blessing to preach to the people
[10:59] who have no beginning
[11:04] and then because the people with a
[11:07] beginning they come and end up somewhere
[11:15] brother there's a book I think is
[11:18] smiling
[11:20] if it is
[11:26] okay
[11:28] now but I want to take this part okay
[11:34] uh
[11:35] Brenda Brendan asked a question
[11:40] then he said where is the sign
[11:44] of the real Seed of Abraham
[11:49] um
[11:51] [Music]
[12:02] yeah
[12:03] since this is the end time
[12:09] they've been preaching about it talking
[12:11] about it but now this is the end time
[12:13] really
[12:18] the signs are there because
[12:26] Christ
[12:27] who had three and a half years of his
[12:31] prophecy I mean
[12:35] and he said now the last three and a
[12:38] half
[12:39] uh yes is now of Lucifer
[12:46] now uh
[12:49] the world the Earth the world
[12:54] is about to start the three and a half
[12:57] years
[12:59] which is the Tribulation period
[13:05] foreign
[13:22] you know I can start at the message
[13:24] church and you stand the message church
[13:26] and you start the Mission Church
[13:32] sometime you find that I've got a
[13:34] certain Doctrine going that way of them
[13:37] what they say Church
[13:44] also going the other way
[13:47] now let's remain as the bride
[13:52] um
[13:54] because the bride is not in pieces
[13:57] the bride has only one God one Faith one
[14:02] baptism everything is one um
[14:09] and the bright is the word of God
[14:14] is
[14:24] again the word is the bride of Christ
[14:29] now this part that I'm looking at here
[14:34] it says it
[14:37] page
[14:41] [Music]
[14:45] one one
[14:48] paragraph 130 paragraph 130. so we're
[14:52] still going to talk about it but I just
[14:55] quote Yeah
[15:00] I want you to know to whom I'll be
[15:04] talking to no yes
[15:07] and the blood test shows whether you are
[15:11] gods or not
[15:14] um
[15:18] we are God's children and you have
[15:21] eternal life
[15:24] but the soldiers you perform that Soul
[15:29] shall be
[15:30] separated okay
[15:35] now here's the thing here now
[15:40] you know the Bible says in the beginning
[15:42] God created
[15:45] now it says
[15:48] anything
[15:50] that had a beginning has an end
[16:01] and because anything that had a
[16:04] beginning is a creation
[16:10] right that's why once you talk about it
[16:14] he has no beginning
[16:19] of God God was not created
[16:23] he was always
[16:28] [Music]
[16:31] I'm looking at this
[16:36] the prophet
[16:38] asked a question here um
[16:41] that is
[16:43] who is this
[16:47] and that is
[16:49] page
[16:51] 29 paper 29 paragraph 1 60. here
[16:56] paragraph 160.
[16:58] but
[17:00] but then where is that Royal Seed of
[17:04] Abraham
[17:14] I thought you'd say yeah yeah it is
[17:20] because it's a question
[17:22] where is where Daniel where is that
[17:27] Royal Seed of Abraham
[17:29] [Music]
[17:31] amen God bless you sir
[17:34] where is the assignment
[17:37] because they have a sign
[17:42] you know we look for or science of
[17:46] things science of the time and Sciences
[17:51] everything comes with a sign it is
[17:56] if something comes
[17:59] we will always look for a size
[18:03] yeah what if you ask for a question
[18:07] and today with the Seed of Abraham
[18:11] no need to ask who are these people
[18:14] you must look for a sign
[18:20] [Music]
[18:31] God came down and was manifested in
[18:35] human flesh
[18:38] that's a great sign
[18:41] and told what Sarah was thinking on in
[18:46] the back
[19:06] now the last sign before the gentle
[19:10] world was destroyed by fire
[19:14] um
[19:19] the world
[19:21] will be destroyed
[19:39] it's not one thing I don't really we
[19:42] have the God created
[19:45] God the Bible says God formed the earth
[19:49] and the world
[19:55] the Earth is the missile I'm standing on
[19:59] here
[20:02] but the world is the system
[20:06] that's why it says he came to the world
[20:09] to the system
[20:12] and the system
[20:16] uh would not believe him
[20:20] rejected him yamana
[20:23] now you see even the system today
[20:28] everywhere Christians are are being
[20:31] chased around now
[20:35] we've been watching that
[20:37] it's towards
[20:39] this is the closing
[20:43] the end of the history of this world
[20:52] now this is the closing
[20:56] the Royal Seed of Abraham
[20:59] is just waiting
[21:03] for that moment
[21:06] uh we have I have something here
[21:12] this book
[21:15] the rapture
[21:17] is there if if not no problem
[21:21] now we read
[21:24] it's a question
[21:26] the prophet asked
[21:31] on
[21:34] okay
[21:36] I will read this part here
[21:40] I'm there because
[21:44] we are not preaching to
[21:46] the world
[21:49] listen now
[21:52] we find
[21:53] that Enoch was the seventh
[21:57] from no one yeah
[22:05] which was a type of the church ages
[22:11] all the rest of the six men before him
[22:14] died
[22:32] did you hear that
[22:35] you because the others you know we're
[22:39] talking about the seven changes
[22:42] but the Brethren from the other ages

[24:03] believe and how even take for this is a
[24:08] Elijah
[24:11] and then he knew he had a revelation
[24:14] that a chariot was coming
[24:18] [Music]
[24:19] not wonderful
[24:21] if you have a a revelation judge the
[24:25] Rapture is about to take place
[24:47] [Applause]
[24:51] when he started
[24:59] he was getting into it
[25:03] he was getting into the Rapture
[25:06] he was getting into the Chariots
[25:10] but he started with rapturing
[25:14] strength
[26:24] [Applause]
[26:30] I mean uh it will happen with you these
[26:35] days

[29:15] not deficient Church age
[29:23] will be called out
[29:27] foreign
[29:33] [Music]
[29:58] now I'm preaching to the last
[30:04] foreign foreign
[30:09] [Applause]
[30:42] last time we were looking
[30:45] but you know brother Brandon says in
[30:48] this who is this
[30:53] the question is who is
[30:59] this Lona
[31:01] not that I lower
[31:03] [Applause]
[31:05] yeah this one
[31:08] yes
[31:11] foreign
[31:25] because I'm looking at this
[31:31] when
[31:33] [Music]
[31:36] when he appeared
[31:39] let me just try to find my picture
[31:44] when he met
[31:46] Abraham
[31:49] he was Melchizedek
[31:53] I want to repeat something a bit
[31:57] you know last time I think you were
[31:59] watching
[32:01] we're talking about what was the title
[32:07] the migration
[32:09] of the citizens of
[32:12] [Music]
[32:13] yeah
[32:18] and but he says when Abraham met him
[32:25] he was
[32:31] so I don't know and the other thing is
[32:34] people understood what the prophet is
[32:38] saying and doesn't matter when Abraham
[32:41] met him
[32:42] he was melchized
[32:46] it was it was God
[32:50] but when Abraham the difference is
[32:54] because Abraham is a citizen me now when
[32:59] he meets Abraham meets him as melchized
[33:04] he said that is
[33:08] a citizen
[33:11] you know you have now the king of Salem
[33:15] amen amen
[33:26] [Music]
[33:32] he said something
[33:40] he is now
[33:46] now we look at it
[33:49] you know how we
[33:52] we looked at it last time I think you've
[33:54] seen it is
[33:57] speaks about this to the first hem
[34:02] um
[34:16] you know he Fester
[34:18] appeared
[34:20] meant this festival
[34:24] and we see again how he met the second
[34:28] Hammer symbolism
[34:32] but
[34:37] he says when Abraham met him
[34:46] all this time is God God
[34:50] but when Abraham met him
[34:53] [Applause]
[34:57] now because Abraham is
[35:02] a citizen um
[35:15] when he met him the first time
[35:19] which is
[35:21] Genesis Chapter 14 verse 18 Genesis
[35:24] Chapter 14 verse 18.
[35:26] he was
[35:28] from heaven
[35:34] from Heaven is really increased off
[35:37] there
[35:38] a priest from heaven
[35:43] I can
[35:46] it is somewhere in the book of Hebrews
[35:48] yeah
[35:51] um
[35:52] I've got an old old book here
[35:57] right login
[36:00] the the
[36:02] I'm trying I'm going to reach this
[36:06] old book of mine
[36:09] you know the first time I met brother
[36:16] and he gave me this book and others as
[36:21] well
[36:23] I didn't know I thought we were we would
[36:27] go together
[36:30] but he decided to go before me but yet
[36:35] all right here where we are now go slap
[36:38] again
[36:39] a king
[36:41] in this book
[36:44] now the
[36:47] the the
[36:49] quotation here is
[36:53] different from
[36:55] the one in your book I mean there what
[36:58] is difference about that what's the
[36:59] difference
[37:07] is the difference
[37:09] this one is the the older
[37:16] as I was told that is
[37:25] amen
[37:26] okay
[37:28] a king comes down from salaam
[37:32] and met Abraham coming from the
[37:35] slaughter of the Kings
[37:38] and this King didn't have no father no
[37:41] mother
[37:45] [Music]
[37:47] had no beginning of days and
[37:53] then now who did Abraham meet
[37:57] now think he he didn't have no father he
[38:02] didn't have no mother he never had the
[38:06] time again
[38:09] amen amen and so that same king of Salam
[38:15] Allah
[38:16] has to be living today
[38:22] amen
[38:38] [Applause]
[38:45] [Music]
[38:52] come in that's why you know
[38:54] he says where is the sign
[38:58] of the royal Seed of Abraham
[39:03] now he says do you see it was
[39:07] ethiopianism
[39:09] that was the son of God
[39:15] hey you know there's things in the Bible
[39:18] here yes
[39:20] you know
[39:22] we have some symbolism
[39:28] which was the logos
[39:45] out of
[39:47] out of God
[39:50] came forth the logos
[39:53] now the Sun that was with the father
[39:56] was the logos
[39:58] [Music]
[40:02] I think page 15.
[40:05] it says
[40:10] it says
[40:15] gave
[40:16] Beth wazala
[40:20] to now
[40:24] this one says
[40:27] he gave birth was Allah
[40:34] to to his
[40:36] do you have that boo brother
[40:40] let me put it right
[40:45] he gave himself
[40:48] death to a son
[40:50] [Applause]
[40:55] yes yeah yeah he says
[40:59] he he gave himself
[41:03] to a son
[41:06] [Applause]
[41:10] you know when he met
[41:14] how he met Abraham
[41:18] foreign
[41:30] uh females Frozen
[41:35] because when Jesus was born
[41:39] Joseph didn't need a female
[41:46] Joseph was put aside
[41:51] and
[41:52] the prophet of God says
[41:56] Gabriel Gabriel came to Mary was a Maria
[42:00] with the seed
[42:04] amen amen
[42:07] then he spoke to Mary Maria
[42:13] he says watching when he spoke to Mary
[42:19] what happened once again only
[42:23] did you know yes the word that he spoke
[42:26] to Mary Elizabeth
[42:41] instead of
[42:44] Joseph
[42:46] came the word
[42:51] and they wait in Merry materialized
[42:58] when it materialized
[43:00] then a son was born
[43:03] [Applause]
[43:06] I'm telling you the true citizen the Cod
[43:10] it is
[43:29] you'll see at the end of when brother
[43:34] bring in the message no at the end of it
[43:39] did you hear him talking about the angel
[43:42] the Angels
[43:46] that's what the people don't know about
[43:49] it because he said he sent the angel
[43:51] with the servants here
[43:57] he says that angel came to
[44:01] himself
[44:03] came to him
[44:06] he says he flew

[48:03] one day can you mean and he spoke peace
[48:07] to me
[48:11] and he gave me eternal life
[48:16] okay

[48:33] met him
[48:36] it said something here
[48:41] let me try it
[48:45] at three
[48:47] 70 here
[48:50] we have read it I I think last week
[48:53] evening
[48:54] okay before we finish
[48:59] Melchizedek was the king of Salem um
[49:04] the first time he saw him coming from
[49:08] heaven
[49:21] that was a second
[49:23] that was another time saw him coming
[49:27] with two men
[49:32] um
[50:08] um
[50:09] you know yeah you see it is very
[50:12] difficult day yeah
[50:14] I mean all right we know that
[50:17] Jesus yes was not the child of Mary
[50:22] of Joseph
[50:25] but if he is talking to the people now
[50:29] he says you know Jesus
[50:34] that's when he's talking to the people
[50:38] yummy
[50:58] Joseph was not his father
[51:02] yet he was called to his father
[51:05] okay even Mary was not a her man his
[51:09] mother
[51:10] um but yet he was called his mom
[51:16] okay all right you know he says
[51:20] but he was made after the order of
[51:24] Melchizedek
[51:26] he had no beginning
[52:06] so he was the one that stood today
[52:11] the thing is
[52:13] if you will remember how Abraham
[52:17] recognized him
[52:21] he says
[52:23] this is how he recognized it is
[52:42] not because he had a sensation
[52:45] God made him
[52:48] a promise gave him a promise
[52:52] and when he come into contact
[52:56] you know if God has promised you
[52:59] something
[53:00] there's a time when you come into
[53:03] contact
[53:04] with what God has promised you now
[53:11] you know when she came into contact
[53:15] she said I perceived
[53:19] you are a prophet um
[53:24] this woman
[53:26] when she met Jesus that's when the two
[53:30] texts
[53:47] she was waiting for that for that word
[53:51] elderly because she kept on saying I
[53:55] know the Messiah
[53:58] he will tell us all things
[54:01] but yet he was a prostitute
[54:05] with a promise yeah
[54:11] was not yet made
[54:13] um
[54:22] [Applause]
[54:23] every moment in a closer he would find
[54:27] some a moment to say something yes
[54:35] next time you see him there
[54:38] [Music]
[54:41] and then next time he meets you he says
[54:46] [Music]
[55:01] um
[55:06] because inside of his way of
[55:12] Abram was an anchor holding that promise
[55:28] tell me
[55:30] when he he come into contact
[55:33] [Applause]
[55:34] with that great magnet
[55:38] he knew that we are asking that promise
[55:42] was in flesh
[55:47] he knew that he
[55:50] he's a man now
[55:54] he made a promise and when the promise
[55:58] took flesh
[56:01] was recognized by Abraham
[56:06] he says what that's when
[56:09] okay instead of you okay you know he's
[56:13] talking about this magnet
[56:18] you know I'm making it they must must
[56:20] put it if it makes a contact with a
[56:23] metal
[56:24] um
[56:27] there's a force
[56:29] but that force is invisible
[56:32] it can pull a matter
[56:35] with that invisible force
[56:39] and that one when he met up
[56:41] [Music]
[56:44] could pull that promise
[56:49] God has put that magnet in you
[56:53] when he comes you should recognize
[56:56] [Music]
[56:58] Sunday
[57:10] [Applause]
[57:21] foreign
[57:28] [Music]
[57:38] [Applause]
[57:43] [Music]
[57:52] when she caught up with
[57:54] the magnet
[57:57] what are you saying today
[58:00] [Applause]
[58:07] now you have a magnetism
[58:10] there is no one is going to say see God
[58:15] as the Bible says
[58:18] to come through a covenant
[58:28] very wonderful
[58:31] look at Moses come into the sea yes
[58:38] and there was something in him
[58:42] is there a man who can risk and try to
[58:46] cross the city
[58:49] no it was that magnet
[58:53] in Moses Moses knew something that um
[59:04] he was not Taking Chances
[59:09] [Music]
[59:12] because he was under a cabinet
[59:37] because that man had a magnet in him
[59:43] yeah the people with a magnet here
[59:49] they know where they are they don't want
[59:52] to believe and what not to believe
[1:00:01] although people are going to and forth
[1:00:06] they can never be deceived
[1:00:12] foreign
[1:00:14] [Applause]
[1:00:32] [Applause]
[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:43] [Applause]
[1:00:52] [Applause]
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:00] and that magnet will just pick you up
[1:01:03] numbers
[1:01:04] when the magnet in you
[1:01:12] you know that's why Enoch already he was
[1:01:17] magnetized
[1:01:19] when he was magnetized he started to
[1:01:23] walk and the Bible says the Bible can
[1:01:27] walk with God
[1:01:30] so the bride of Christ will walk with
[1:01:34] God
[1:01:38] they will be gone
[1:01:41] she will be gone
[1:01:43] um
[1:01:47] amen
[1:01:54] how did he meet Brothers
[1:02:11] Johnny
[1:02:16] if I'm asking this question
[1:02:21] I that's why I first
[1:02:24] answered he first answered yeah
[1:02:30] how
[1:02:31] Abraham met him
[1:02:37] being
[1:02:38] magnetized
[1:02:41] and say what this is him
[1:02:48] foreign
[1:03:19] now he tend to
[1:03:21] utility
[1:03:51] foreign
[1:04:21] foreign
[1:04:40] because Christ is the anointing who
[1:04:42] created
[1:04:43] it's not that I mean a human name
[1:04:47] that's why brother Brennan says
[1:04:55] that is the family name
[1:04:58] amen amen as well as the anointing
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:13] if something which is revealed some say
[1:05:16] it is not revealed some say this
[1:05:18] something
[1:05:21] who do you say that I am
[1:05:27] all right
[1:05:29] there was a pause
[1:05:34] a pose
[1:05:36] so they stopped Bama
[1:05:39] and Peter said Thou Art the Christ
[1:05:44] son of the Living God
[1:05:50] amen amen
[1:05:52] Thou Art
[1:05:54] where now please do he didn't say Jesus
[1:05:59] Christ
[1:06:01] now the Lord said go City Peter Petrus
[1:06:06] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:06:09] you
[1:06:12] it is my Father
[1:06:15] in heaven
[1:06:20] did you know that scripture
[1:06:22] and God said to
[1:06:25] Moses Moses tell the children of Israel

[1:06:36] heaven
[1:06:39] you remember the scripture
[1:06:43] you remember the scriptures

[1:06:49] all right
[1:06:53] he said what is
[1:06:56] tell the children of Israel
[1:07:00] I spoke to you
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:06] sorry
[1:07:10] you know
[1:07:12] reading food can be dangerous without
[1:07:18] a magnet
[1:07:27] reading without revelation
[1:07:33] you will interpret it without title
[1:07:36] inside
[1:07:37] the way it suits your mind learn their
[1:07:40] lives away that is when you are ready
[1:07:43] without food
[1:07:48] when
[1:07:51] we read
