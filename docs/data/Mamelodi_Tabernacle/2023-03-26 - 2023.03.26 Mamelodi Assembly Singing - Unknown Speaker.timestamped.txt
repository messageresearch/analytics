[1:04:37] to deal with the
[1:04:39] the second portion of the announcement
[1:04:43] that we had last week
[1:04:49] I think the pastor thought that there
[1:04:52] was not much emphasis on
[1:04:55] the destination
[1:05:02] we have gone into details regarding the
[1:05:07] plot area
[1:05:12] there is an offer that came in that is
[1:05:15] being considered for the purchase of the
[1:05:18] length
[1:05:22] [Applause]
[1:05:24] Okay we're going to give you some
[1:05:27] details of how
[1:05:30] the Beulah Land looks like
[1:05:33] a a division
[1:05:38] I'm waiting for the technicians to bring
[1:05:41] up the
[1:05:43] foreign
[1:06:46] that's the video
[1:06:49] I will give emphasis whilst it's done
[1:06:53] showing
[1:06:57] God bless you
[1:07:18] okay
[1:07:20] uh
[1:07:21] can you ring around the building
[1:07:25] technicians that building
[1:07:31] around
[1:07:34] Your Castle on years
[1:07:36] right take it a little back to the
[1:07:39] entrance
[1:08:00] okay that's fine yeah that's okay
[1:08:03] now on the left hand side
[1:08:07] my left hand says which which will be
[1:08:10] your right hand side take it down a
[1:08:11] little bit
[1:08:16] no the other side
[1:08:18] yes yes further to the corner yes there
[1:08:22] is a baptismal facility there
[1:08:25] is
[1:08:27] outside not inside the church
[1:08:31] you go up the stairs
[1:08:35] it's outside
[1:08:37] now the parking facility here takes plus
[1:08:42] 400 cars
[1:08:49] right around that building there are
[1:08:52] parking facilities
[1:08:57] there is a security
[1:09:00] small security house
[1:09:03] security so as you go inside the
[1:09:06] premises there is a security house
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:17] now take it a little bit back to where
[1:09:20] you had showed the entrance into the
[1:09:23] church
[1:09:25] okay that's the church you go through
[1:09:28] that entrance
[1:09:31] you can throw curtains to demarcate or
[1:09:36] partitions if there is a smaller
[1:09:41] setting like not month end or
[1:09:44] conventions
[1:09:50] the walls are sound proof
[1:09:57] you can cook here there is a large
[1:10:00] kitchen industry
[1:10:08] and it's it's what we call
[1:10:12] pluck
[1:10:14] and play guess
[1:10:18] so once you go in there the whole
[1:10:20] convention is done

[1:11:29] happening
[1:11:33] I don't want to talk about how this
[1:11:35] change came to be
