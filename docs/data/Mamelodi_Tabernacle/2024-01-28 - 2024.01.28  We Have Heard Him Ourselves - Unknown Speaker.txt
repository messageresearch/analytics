Description:
Title: We Have Heard HimOurselves
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 28 January 2024

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

John 4: 39 - 42
John 4 :29

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience that we should hear the word from Him ourselves and not from any other person.

The Samaritan woman all the years she was waiting for the word to be made flesh. When the word was made flesh she started to tell people to come and see a man who told her all things.

The real gospel is the one that brings you to the vessel. The Samaritan woman knew that the only person who can tell her all things is Christ.

You can be testified to, but you still need to hear Him yourself. After hearing a testimony from a brother or sister you have not yet arrived, as you still need to hear from Him.

Brother Branham has introduced the Pastor to Him. The pastor is just a messenger, but you need to pass that. When the word touches the inner man, it made the Samaritans to be able to differentiate that now it is not the woman speaking. When a brother testifies to a person he is just a door. But the real testimony is when God testifies to you through a brother. 

When God has predestinated you He will surely visit you. He will finish the work that He has started. He called you to be his dwelling place.
When you are predestinated and you believe you will arrive. If you are a true worshipper you are already in eternity. The eternal beings are now coming together because the time of the rapture has come.

The person who is walking with God is not controlled by the natural things. If somebody is still lacking behind, loving the things of the world he is not on the run way.  When the rapture will happen you won't miss the way to Him, because you will change first, and put on the supernatural gear.

If the seventh seal is revealed to you, you will know it yourself. The seventh seal is the great mystery of God, and it does not come to you through preaching, but...

[Applause] came [Music] okay amen so we are going now to sorry I'm looking for you there amen here is my the scripture for today the scripture is John chapter 4 vers 39 I think we'll start there yes okay Brethren and many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that I ever did okay continue my brother so when the Samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he will t with them and he abod there two days and many more believed because of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of The World God bless you as you take your seats we have had him our our we not hearing from another person so we'll continue we want to thank God it started with the Samaritan woman it started with a Samaritan woman that woman so blessed she was going around testifying that I knowah coming how did she know that Messiah is coming just like we have known what Satan's up to this morning and even the people that are involved that Samaritan woman also was blessed and you are also blessed because we also have known what about to take place this morning all right amen now it was after the testimony of this woman when he said come see a man there were men in those days Many Men Kings Great Men but this woman introduced this one said come and see amen [Music] amen this man before he came in this form he was The Great I Am starting in the form of a rainbow and into a theop form that's why the singer say What a Mighty God but this man could change and take a form of a man like [Music] me now this woman was one of the Blessed who were predestinated before the foundation of the world now the prophet of God says she was waiting oh all this years or those years for the vision for that word to be made flesh am she knew that he will come in the body form now she started to walk around saying I know hey this is wonderful amen I know mesiah com okay amen and then one day Messiah arrived talk to her and her eyes were open now she started come see a man which man Mama which told me all [Music] things just as he has told us we know said all things things by their names amen amen starting from the and so forth now let's follow it which told me all things you know if somebody can say to me I have seen a man who told me all things I will still be in doubt because I know he is a man he can he cannot carry all things amen amen amen then H let's carry on now now some people picked that up that this mama is toing come see amen now because the real real gospel is the one that brings you to the vessel itself amen and which told me things that ever I did then she knew and said is this am I on the right path here is this not the he told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ she knew that the only person who is capable of telling me all things is [Music] Christ that's right no other person knew but Christ he will tell you all things that's why I worship him this morning then the Bible says here verse 39 and many of the Samaritans of that City pardon me okay yes brother all right amen let's finish here then we'll take care of the rest is inde a wonderful scripture amen one of this women in the Bible and many verse 39 verse 39 and many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him for the saying of the woman meaning they believed on Jesus for their saying of the woman which testified he told me all that I ever did so when the Samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would with them and ab there two days okay amen then I continue and and and they said unto the woman now woman now we believe not because of your saying meaning not because of your testimony for we have had him ourselves you know it should come to everybody because uh uh oh sorry you know that's how many churches were started uh after hearing somebody else tesy amen and yet have you not heard amen I can testify to you but you still need to hear yourself and to hear himself [Music] amen and that kind of a thing created many churches of the people bearing a testimony of somebody else had not yet arve then they end up there having brother or sister and it that is not salvation I said now listen amen so 40 40 40 yeah I'm back to 40 so when the Samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tell with them two days verse 41 verse 41 and many more believed because of his own word somebody has because of his own [Music] his after hearing a testimony by a brother or a sister you haven't yet arrived you you must arrive where you yourself in person you see him you hear that's right amen this is what we need even this morning to hear then listen to this and many more believed because of his own word then they turned and said to the woman now we believe that's right amen amen she could have asked a question all this time you haven't believe they believe is her testimony and she could have started the church right there am and continue as it doesn't stop there you've got come to where he is amen let's continue now this I love this 41 and many more believed because of his own word I believe you are here because you have had [Applause] his we are just like Messengers but you must come and go past the messenger amen you know even brother he introduced me to [Music] him now I wonder if how many here as you know I told you about the story of a young man we met I was with a brother from Sand now we were trying to enter uh into a of somebody else but we were greeted by writing there what did it say no customers Beyond this point yes no customers allowed Beyond this point restriction restriction now you find this we had this in the churches restrictions the restrictions amen and the people would end up halfway now let me read we are going to read some things quickly here and now it says firstly and many more believed because of his word own word own meaning you have come here to hear the word of God but you should hear his [Music] own because everybody can talk about Jesus that's not salvation you should hear own word is that right amen and said listen I repeat and and they said unto the woman now we believe amen she could argue say all this time I have testified you you don't believe because when that word touch the it become different from the utterances of that woman amen when that word touch the inner man now they could differentiate that this now is not that woman we have arrived if you hear Brother testifying to you just Dash the door and you don't go back and say heard the word of God to you haven't yet heard him amen amen you've seen many people they will come to church because of testimony of somebody when somebody that somebody leaves the church they join up with that he becomes like the Demi God Amen let me read amen now the Bible says uh I will finish this one and said unto the woman now we believe all this time they were just listening until they could hear him themselves is then they said now I wonder if somebody today will say now I believe brother saw testif to me that that's the thing that in the long run it causes things because the people come to church sit in the church each and every one of them has his own man or I was testified to by Brother the real testimony it's when God speaks to you through this [Applause] brother that's the real one where's the king oh he's not here today yes okay amen all right let me carry on um now we believe not because of your saying for we have H him ourselves I wonder if somebody can say now I believe not of your testimony but I have heard him myself amen and they continue to say and you know that I have heard him my we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of the world a quick and short connection these people were predestinated before the foundation of the world predestinated and at at the appointed time if God has predestinated you surely he will visit you must finish his job he has called you amen so he must finish his job and and you become his Dwelling Place he has called you for a Dwelling Place he wants to live in you amen that's why he said let us make men our image [Applause] [Music] that's why the secret of the seventh SE when the seven seal was open the seven that's right because when he arrived at 7 as brother says seven is always a mystery if you pass seven you must enter into something Supernatural in the book uh the future home future home says if you hit maybe I've got if you hit seven what are you going to do where are you going if you can worship and you don't hit seven you will worship and worship and worship without arriving and the people some people have failed to arrive because this thing goes like in the cycle if you are predestinated and you believe you will arrive because it is in a cycle of Eternity feeling you get today you see churches are full with the people that are halfway now we we want to look for a few minutes amen amen myself I search myself am to to make sure that I [Music] haveed that's why they say now we believe not because of your testimony we ourselves isn't it wonderful now I I will read you some because our existence is beyond our [Music] bodies our existence is beyond our bodies oh somebody borrowed me F this is what are you going to do now you have run out of your complete Serv if we have run like that we have done past the seventh Church age amen amen from the seventh Church age it's still calling then the Seven Seals All right now I quote page 27 fure home future home amen what are you you going to do now at school a teacher asked me when I was doing standard six and said young where are you going now amen amen I was so hurt not by the question of the teacher but I I knew that the standard of things in my family could not put me further than standard all right amen but at least if a man with a you call it Bach what what what is that Bach b what what does that mean uh it's a the qualification all right the level of qualification okay because there was a brother uh we were at a wedding then he said to us hey I was at the wedding last I attended a wedding and yet we were at the wedding said there was a man there talking about those things of Bachelors and amen then I said to the man God bless you how was it how was the wedding he said yeah you know that man well educated I said how was [Music] theing amen amen you know me also I'm glad when children and they they H they can carry on that's a wonderful we wish every child could go to school in state of roaming about amen amen now you have run out of your complete Serv oh the brother didn't know that I've got this book also yeah brother we are equal here here is mine okay we are together mine here says this page then I start from here if you've got eternal life that page 31 there is only one form of ET of eternal life yes that's God and you are an expressed attribute not just an attribute expressed attribute if you are not if you are not you are not going to be there no man can come to me said the Lord except my father draw him amen amen you can carry on with this then you are in eternity where you was all the time meaning that if you are a true worshiper here you are already in [Music] eternity amen God bless you Eternal brothers and sister the first time I saw brother gabri uh it was the first time to see him in the in the body of the physical body and I said to him God bless you my eternal you know this message can take you as far as you can recognize is ET you know you know we have been squeezed now what I mean I'm not talking about the squeezing but I'm saying we are coming together the Eternal beings are now starting to come together because the time of the Rapture has come am in so much that I think I just slept for one hour and why because you know if you you are Eternal as the prophet says man is eternal as his maker you know if you are etal it's not even easy to sleep what I mean especially when the Rapture is so close there's something in you keeping you away because you are going the Bible says and Enoch the seventh man from Adam walked with God the people that are walking with God today they can't even sleep why you know that CH there is a big wheel turning in my heart there is a big turning in my heart how can you sleep if there's a will turning in your heart ET you can't even sleep because a person who works with God is not controlled by natural things let me tell you something I can be together with some other people chatting and but I end up Longing To Be amen amen because when I am alone I can talk with him that's when I'm alone and I feel the the touch of the you can hear rupture in you body the bed before it can take off there is that thing inside of that bed in the body in preparation for taking off how many have that today there's something in you in preparation for the rupture it's continuing just like that and that's why that's why we say I am never alone I hear people saying I'm so bored not the children of [Applause] God where is he when you are feeling B because his children can talk to him because there's somebody to talk to they not checking we they are not checking how much they have done they own Pilgrim let me do something if somebody today is still Ling behind living the things of the world he not on the uh you should have seen Enoch how he changed when he started to walk with God Walking with God can you walk with God Amen all right but he walked with God pleased God so much until God say I can't leave this one behind he accompanied God you two can work with God look brother sister the world right now the signs of the sign of Lord has passed now is the sign of no it's also rushing to the end what's left according to the scriptures what do you expect after these Flats all right amen uh somebody think he still has future although that is in his or her mind you know a person who has future in this world can even pray to God to ask for many days extension all right amen but while there is someone who every day he he thinks of the arrival of God but there's some who has just received increase let me finish children of God okay I think so far you have heard what we were talking about to this point you have heard what we wanted to say this part here it says when you hit seven where are you going the Lord said no no man can come to me except my father draw him I have seen that that no man can come unless the father him I read which passes away all these old things these things uh don't so so it speaks of Eternity the Holy Ghost is eternal then you are in eternity where you was brother I'm going to close you are in eternity where you was all the time but you've just recognized it now but all this time in eternity all right amen now I read this part let me go back brother B says in one 27 uh you might say to me you know I've got something here I will I will come with it it is this Jewish priest talking about brother let us let us not touch it now I will bring it because uh Moses and Elijah are supposed now to appear but after the Rapture is Transfiguration now things that are happening like this one is a Jewish priest talking about brother will show what is happening right amen you have some Jews that are predestinated we'll come to that let me read this hey Moses and Elijah will reappear on M Transfiguration and those who are predestinated will recognize [Applause] them you know when the Rapture shall take place you can miss the way to him because you will change first and you'll get into this Supernatural GE isn't not wonderful that's why because you don't know the time a person if we don't know the time we prepare ourselves and we remain [Music] ready to remain being ready it doesn't mean you must just stop your cigarette a bit because when you DB it but still longing for it you are still smoking brother what are you going to do you run out of your complete servant you remember we read this even the other day now where are you going we'll come to seven again that's why uh when it comes to seven others go in it is not revealed it is This Not That M amen did you know that if it is revealed to you you know amen did you know that if it is revealed to you you know because he said let us make men in our image amen now this seventh seal it's a great mystery of God hallu you don't receive it by uh teaching it anoints you it's part of [Music] you they call it the seven amen now let's read you know it's not something where you can just they say the Lord Jesus is coming spend the whole week not drinking really put fear in me that Rapture can come it doesn't mean Rapture can take you because the rest of the week you are not drinking or he's taking you because you are talking about you become part of the thing amen that's why I it's not [Music] like surprised that is it me no you walk Hallelujah that's why he say before the Rapture he was on the he started to walk amen Elijah elah after he has seen The Chariot coming he started to walk knowing where he was going amen there's some people who have started to walk they are not of this world yes amen amen amen and the devil and with all his agents will do nothing he has some agents they
