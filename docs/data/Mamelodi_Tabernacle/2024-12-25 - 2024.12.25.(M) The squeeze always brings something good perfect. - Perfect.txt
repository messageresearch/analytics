I greet each and everybody inside this worldall in the precious name of our savior [Music] Jesus Christ you may just take your seats just for while let me start by greeting my M my mentor I am a son of cast still under still under he asked me to open this service for him this morning it's just going I'm just going to be very very very short um I'm going to give a briefing [Music] I'm going to give a brief for to the the is going to f the [Music] of going to because they going to they going to the camp for and years yeah I'm just preaching because thisy been recruited since from the first church age they had theirs and trainers there not wrong because they're going to hear the [Music] voice then they will rise up and join us so that you can go to together to [Music] the just to rest before we go to [Applause] people are making noise outside you have got many prophets outside now some of them are making people fall like FES being doomed some of them are trying to desend but there is a a quietness somewhere just like during his first coming when people are making noise outside telling people that is coming attracting many CRS but they Vision Con in that silence and this is the same silent which is now here we are just attending a marriage um pregnancy because we are already pregnant in that silence let's read the book of Romans chapter [Music] 8s 17 and 18 ver 17 18 Romans chapter 8 verse 17 and 18 and if children then as as of God and join us with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us let's just close our eyes as we ask our pastor Pastor Sal to pray for this let's pray our heavenly father we are so privilege to come into your presence with this Bible opened we are approaching your holy presence exactly asking for Gra grace and mercy to get into that silence to know the mystery that we have sealed exactly since the beginning of the world and all the churches are looking exactly but they cannot find but by your grace you predestinated us to find the secret and today oh Lord we are gathering together around this precious word the book of The Seven Seals to get into that silence and to prepare ourself because we know that you are coming to take us Lord we ask you to bless the preer our servants our precious Pastor amen so that he might be anointed by the word and anointed by the Holy Spirit to bring out this word for us and to bless our souls take the control of everything oh Lord because we ask it in Jesus Christ name amen amen bless you may take your seats I said I'm going to be very short because I'm opening this services and I said I'm going to give you a ding um so that we can be ready so that we can know ourselves is going to be squee bring something good [Music] because according to our Prophet the seed has become the seed again and if the seat has become the seed [Music] again it does not need any rain anymore it must stay in the presence of the [Music] son waiting for the so that it can be separated from the [Music] sh while the El W it take his place this where we are now thenum is also this which which we are expecting which are expecting to come but let me just perhaps go on with what I'm saying here we will come to that not later um the we [Music] squeeze is to press something from different side just like when you want the juice from the orange you have to squee the orang so that you can get that juice or is to force something to go through or to go into [Music] passing through difficult time that squee let me read something here he the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is liken to a p her righteousness is his attributes his own glorious identity is found in him her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to the ending she is the work of a lord is the work of a lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is s up and manifested the Eternal [Music] wisdom and of God how can one phom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we accept it by faith for God has spoken it but not only is the Candlestick of gold a beaten [Music] handen according to her blueprint which Spirit given outside of a Lord and Master Jesus Christ was ever p a people so beaten and P the of Jesus he is filling up the suffering that Christ has left goods are spoiled her life is in Jey she is accounted as a sheep for she is killed all the day she suffered much but in in in it allate not retaliate not neither does she cause others to suffer Wy of the Gospel is the lovely bread of [Music] Christ gold isable whereas brass will break with the beating this gold of God will bear her [Music] suffering Not Bow not broken not destroy but formed as a thing of beauty a joy forever my trials and tting praise God that is what peace amen that is what peace is Jesus was also squee to be perfect by the by the things he suffered I said Peace always bring something perfect he learned obedience you see he himself he [Music] suffered he learned obedience by the that he suffered he made perfect he actually made perfect by the things that he suffered he was a son yet he yet he Lear [Music] obedience May the things which he suffered being made perfect he became the author of Eternal [Music] salvation unto all them unto all them that obey him in a plain language the very character of Jesus Christ was perfected by suffering to PA he has left his church a measure of [Music] suffering by their faith in suffering for him would come to a place of perfection so I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot with him you have to suffer to [Music] rain the reason for this is that [Music] character simply is never made without [Applause] suffering character is not character is a victory it's not a [Music] gift a man without character cannot dream canot because power apart from cour is Satan with character is fit to Ru you cannot have character unless you have gone through suffering after you have suffered then you have character before a Christian can be a Christian before before a Christian can be a perfect [Music] Christian he must be squee so he himself must be SED let me read something for you here there was too much of you in you had to squee it [Music] out and while that King was coming off [Music] it is hot but after a while the sky will clear back then you will see the purose of God then you will cry I know my redeemer Liv this little child and things are just it's just for a moment and they will fade and pass away but they are only done for your good let us remember that God would get Glory out of it beautiful is kissing is kissing you out of you [Music] Because unless you are squeed out of you you never become a CH always say the way I think way I see it then you must it must be God who through you it must be God who sees through you amen beautiful it is written in one of the scriptures in the Bible that trials are brought upon us and are more precious to us than it is God giving us those trials and after we become his property and our confession and our baptis promise to walk in life for him every trial that comes upon us is to perfect us for hisory is to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than before [Music] Tri you must Beed when you are then you become what you ought to be you are born here in s and coming to the world speak life you have to be transformed and this p is one of [Music] transformation that is the way you are transformed after the squeeze the Christian becomes perfect a kiss becomes settled a kiss becomes established a Christian becomes strengthened no more unstable let me repeat after this spee the Christian becomes perfect he becomes established in the faith he become strengthened in the faith he becom settled in the fa no more unstable because if he has not gone through these things after a while you will find him being [Music] anist amen before the children of Israel could get out of bondage in Egypt they were persecuted were Afflicted they were given a number of bricks to produce but when the message of them of freeing them out of bondage when that message arrives the afflictions to be more now far say You must tell them you must tell them to give you the same number of bricks but you must not give them wood to B because usually they give them they had to produce that number but they were given now they say they must produce that same [Music] number and they must go and look for wood and their Affliction came more those who were working in the working in the office they had to get out of off they must go and work the bricks those afflictions they were squee squeeing them out of [Music] Egypt they afflictions they wereing Egypt out of them that they can no more those pces they are squeeing you out of the way [Applause] that you must not love the world anymore they suffered until God said now I'm going to send them another plague which will be greater than this one they will never tolerate that and after that PL they were allowed to get down this is what happens to them sometimes when God squee you he you because he trust you when he let me read something here before I go to that he says it seems like the Christian Life is if the fellow is not absolutely centered on Christ the Christian life seems like also many disappointment [Music] but those disappointments are God's Divine will happening for [Music] us and it don't seem like it would be that but it is God's way of doing things he let us H the ring so to see what we will do when mes he started to cry said why are you [Music] crying speak and go forward that is what it must happen to you and me if we trust the way the the the way of God when things happen to us we must go back Godless disappointment happen to show [Music] Victory P something now remember God count when God has counted you worthy when you have a test now don't fail this don't fail this when you have a trial or test it shows the grace of God has found you I saides sometimes he will let you go through some certain trial because he is trusting that's why he let job to go through that trial because he said to Satan have you seen my s how he me he does not love you he has he is wealthy if you can take that he will show you that he don't love you when you have trial or test it CH the grace of God has found you found favor with God God believes that you will stand that test he knew that will stand that test it was able even his wife he said God has given has taken let let go the name of the Lord be praised that is always what the child of God [Music] will bring you closer to God than before the spe it will bring closer and closer and before this peace why does let TR come he puts be in the mouth of of them he put and Mak them to obey him those TRS bring us into closer fellowship with God we ask God for comfort and peace what give us the best he could give us trials andul trials and [Music] tribulation that is the best that God can give us than Comfort our comfort is just be the river not [Applause] [Music] brings you closer to before it depends what is inside you when God want to separate brings the squee when when the squeeze come if you are not his then you will move away but if you are be the more you come closer and closer to you it brings what kind of SE is in [Music] but God knows he the following wased before they could something good because have is to go is to be forced to go [Music] through or to go into then for the Hebrew children they could see the power of God over the fire they were supposed to go through a certain squee they were squee they said to the king when the king says sh are you doing it Del not willing to bow down to my image don't you see the fire they said to him our God they were depending on the ability of the and they when before they could see the of stand by the we even if the spee goes harder even if they could see the fire beinging even if they could feel the heat of this the fire far far [Music] away but they stood with the we We Shall Not Bow to other gods before seeing the power of God over the fire before seeing the invisible [Music] visible they were squee [Music] first the Fourth Man in the fire the heat of Fire from this four from this three not not from everybody El they took [Music] that when that fire was not so hot it was it was it was full Inside the Fire but those who were caring them when they tried to throw them the fire B the heat was there but for this three it was taken was not taken from every it was taken only from those all those who were there the hardness of the heat but those three because they were with the fourth man they couldn't see the fourth man they couldn't see him they didn't tolerate that trials and you must remember it was at the beginning of the gentle [Music] dispensation the gentle dispens started with the worship of an image forcing people to worship the image of of a holy man you must remember that image was the image of Daniel after Daniel has interpreted the dream of the king the king believed that his who was was in it was his God [Music] even though he said this is the of he believe that his was the one who was in Dani why he changed the name of [Applause] [Music] Daniel then he made the image of Dan [Music] then he forc all the people to worship that image the gentle dispensation will end the same way there will come a time where you will be fored to worship an [Music] image it will seem to be a nice thing when they start to talk about it but it will end being the world councel of churches we know you know it is already prophesied that it will happen and we know it will happen it is it is been built let me just read for a while furthermore the will not be will not only be kept but as this Mo becomes the image erected to the Beast as this move becomes the the image the Beast the Saints will be gone in the Rapture but let me [Music] there they say I will also keep thee from the hour of Temptation we shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth this ver is not a declaration that the true church will go into andul it will keep them I will keep thee from the hour of Temptation why why am I reading this I want to show you that the gentle dispensation it will end the same way they will come that the time that people will be forced to worship the image this temptation is exactly like the Temptation in Eden it will be a very inviting proposition [Music] held up in direct opposition to God's commanded [Music] way from the standpoint of reasoning it will be so very right so enlightening lifegiving to full the world only the very elect will not be F the Temptation will come as the eom move that has started on what seem such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ prayer that we all might be one become so strong politically that that best pressure upon the [Music] government to cause all to join with her either directly or indirectly that is what it says it says it will be a proposition which is inv will say Jesus said if we are his if we are his we must love one another why can't we different denomination why can't we be one because he said we must love one another they are try to build an image of a holy man because this scripture was said by Jesus they will try to build the same thing come Danel before seeing the angel the Lord the pillar of Fire standing between him and the Lions the Lions he went through trials Temptations and TRS he knew that his God is able to deliver him from [Music] that but he couldn't see this he had to go first through temptation [Music] trials and TRS so that you could see this things sometimes to see the power of on you you have to go through some trial you know about that lady who was Prayed by Brother br he had was suffering froma thenay for said you are she went she started testifying saying I am he I am here people were laughing at even her husband could you eat could [Applause] but I am person that she was going through some testing she was going through a squee before she could see the manifestation of the prayer they say even members people who are praying lose this they came to her we believe but don't say like that because you are bringing the to he went on saying praise God I you see she had to go through some testing before she see one day she didn't expect that but she one day I'll be able to know squeeze brings you to Perfection it brings you to something good David before becoming a King David before becoming a king he wased and the Holy Ghost was on him but he had to he had to go through some Tri before he can take his seat you have to go through that before you can be what you are say God let disappointment happen to show Victory let me finish by reading this he desired to love a of his [Music] own a of sons SS like himself there before him lies all men as one lamb of [Music] Cl out of that same L he will now make vessels un honor and un dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those who those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their work he reprs with all suffering and gentleness and he Chas he chastens with nail [Music] SC sometimes this P must take the vessel must take the vessel heing on and work on and break in order that he may reild it exactly as he desires [Music] it bring so that he can he may reild it exctly as he desire it but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is no there is not there cannot be bless you [Applause] amen amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen it is his choosing hallelujah hallelujah to choose men to Walk In His Image hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen when you young sisters are walking up dressed up it is his choosing to make you walk in His image amen amen there will be a squeeze but a squeeze is not a tribulation squeeze better amen amen a squeeze is to make you shy amen amen amen amen I see a lot of time when a woman wants to make a drink better they put it in a brender blend squeeze it out hallelujah hallelujah so God is squeezing us to bring the best out of us amen amen Daniel he had to go into the D because when he was outside he wouldn't know that can shut the mouth of the lion it's only when he went into the den that's when he knew that God can do this amen amuah they didn't know that God the fire until they
