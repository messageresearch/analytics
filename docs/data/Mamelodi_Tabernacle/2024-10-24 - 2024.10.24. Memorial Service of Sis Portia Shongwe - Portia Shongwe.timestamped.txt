[38:00] 30 Jesus answered and said unto them ye
[38:04] do not not knowing the scriptures nor
[38:08] the power of God for in the resurrection
[38:11] they neither marry nor are given in
[38:14] marriage but are as the angels of God in

[38:38] family just to read the word Lord and we
[38:42] invite you Lord to
[38:44] come and be part of our gathering here
[38:48] Lord so that we should engage each
[38:52] other and be one mind and one
[38:56] spirit we just read one
[39:00] verse wish we believe Lord Lord Almighty
[39:04] you'll expand it that it will reach the
[39:07] hearts of those that are
[39:11] saddened and then by the end of the

[39:27] you be the one Lord Almighty that will

[39:34] Almighty they might feel
[39:36] it may you bless this scripture that we
[39:39] have read may you Lord
[39:43] Almighty let it feel let it find a place
[39:47] Lord in our
[39:48] hearts father we pray in the name of our
[39:51] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[39:54] amen you may be seated God BL
[40:01] what time is it my
[40:03] brother if there's anybody that has got
[40:06] time can you just borrow me the was
[40:08] sheets it's during the week we we don't
[40:11] have to take much time people are going
[40:15] to work
[40:19] tomorrow I just just want
[40:22] to I won't be long maybe I'll just take
[40:25] something like 30 minutes
[40:33] there's two watches
[40:35] there they make sure it's I think it's
[40:38] 10 to9 10 to9 maybe I might end up at
[40:43] 209
[40:46] just may the Lord bless
[40:52] you so we've just read one
[40:56] scripture says now uh
[41:00] God
[41:02] uh I would like us to drag it up to
[41:06] verse
[41:08] 32 start from verse 29 up to verse
[41:11] 32 verse 29 Jesus answered and said unto
[41:15] them ye do not knowing the scriptures
[41:19] nor the power of God for in the
[41:22] resurrection they neither marry nor are
[41:25] given in marriage but are as the angels
[41:28] of God in heaven but as touching the
[41:31] resurrection of the Dead have ye not
[41:34] read that which was spoken unto you by
[41:38] God saying I am the god of Abraham and
[41:41] the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob
[41:44] God is not the god of the dead but of
[41:46] the living amen okay fine
[41:51] amen uh I think we are not so much
[41:54] concerned about the death
[42:01] we are concerned about the
[42:04] resurrection amen so now our
[42:09] ministry should uh reflect that one of
[42:13] our Lord Jesus
[42:17] Christ so death is not much in our
[42:25] hearts it hasn't got space in our
[42:30] heart we are
[42:33] concerned our concern is on the
[42:39] resurrection not the
[42:42] death now the ministry of our Lord Jesus
[42:48] Christ was much on the
[42:55] resurrection and all his
[42:59] speech his
[43:02] sermons it it they will always end up
[43:06] with with with with
[43:11] conquering
[43:14] so I remember whenever he
[43:20] changes from one dispensation to
[43:25] another his
[43:28] always speaking about him
[43:32] going uh to be
[43:37] killed but stop
[43:41] there he say now okay I
[43:45] will the
[43:48] Pharisees the
[43:50] elders they will come and arrest
[43:55] me and they will beit me up they do
[43:58] whatever they
[43:59] want they will kill
[44:02] me but I will resurrect on
[44:09] the there's a time where he said now
[44:13] destroy this
[44:16] Temple I will raise it up in three
[44:20] days exactly so now his
[44:24] speech is always full of
[44:29] resurrection and he he always displayed
[44:35] Resurrection whenever there's
[44:38] death if he happen to go where the death
[44:42] is he will display
[44:46] Resurrection you remember about Abra I
[44:50] mean
[44:52] Lazarus they told him that Lazarus is
[44:55] dead but when when he arrived
[44:58] there he displayed
[45:01] resurrection that that was part of his
[45:05] ministry remember
[45:08] about he also
[45:12] displayed and now when he speaks about
[45:16] himself he spoke about his
[45:20] resurrection Hallelujah now
[45:23] here in verse 31 verse 31 2 he says uh I
[45:31] am the god of Abraham and know he start
[45:33] by saying but as touching the
[45:36] Resurrection on verse 31 but as touching
[45:39] the resurrection of the Dead have you
[45:41] not read that which was spoken unto you
[45:44] by God
[45:50] himself
[45:53] saying I am the god of Abraham
[45:57] and the god of Isaac and the god of
[46:02] Jacob then he continues and
[46:05] says God is not the god of the
[46:09] day right he is not the good of the I
[46:14] mean not the of the
[46:19] day
[46:20] but of the
[46:23] living because his ministry
[46:28] if he touches
[46:30] death he must touch
[46:34] Resurrection he won't just say death and
[46:37] then it end UPS there he must always
[46:40] have an
[46:44] answer we
[46:46] together so
[46:49] now that's why I
[46:52] said that has got no space in our heart
[46:57] am I understand now according to the
[47:02] Bible when God created
[47:06] man he created a space in a
[47:10] man which was his
[47:13] place it's like when you are building a
[47:17] house you cannot build a
[47:20] house and and you don't identify your
[47:23] position in that house
[47:27] build that house it might have a kitchen
[47:31] might have a dining
[47:32] room but you will say when I want to
[47:35] relax this is my
[47:38] place so when you build it you know
[47:41] where is your
[47:44] relaxation when God created
[47:47] man if he wanted to
[47:49] relax he knew very well that he will
[47:53] relax his his soul in heart of a
[47:58] man so now in a heart of a man is the
[48:03] relaxation
[48:04] place of God that's where the soul
[48:09] is now in the soul of
[48:13] man there's no
[48:16] death now I've got a scripture
[48:19] here okay let let me let me first show
[48:23] you the dispensation
[48:27] on Matthew
[48:32] 16 you saw a
[48:35] Ministry that does not
[48:38] change according to the
[48:42] dispensation then he that Ministry
[48:45] becomes
[48:47] dominant does not
[48:49] move so the ministry of our Lord Jesus
[48:54] Christ it was moving
[48:57] the ministry of
[48:59] Moses taking the children of
[49:02] Israel it was on
[49:06] Transit it was changing whenever it
[49:10] is when he crosses the Red Sea the
[49:13] ministry changes when he
[49:16] crosses the river Jordan the ministry
[49:20] changes our
[49:22] ministry the ministry of our Lord Jesus
[49:24] Christ was exactly like that there was a
[49:29] time when he displays the
[49:32] power when he raises the
[49:35] days when he he he he he he woke upon
[49:39] the
[49:40] sea he was displaying the
[49:43] power right but there came a time but
[49:47] but that
[49:49] Ministry he wanted
[49:51] people to know who he was
[49:57] Ministry would not been a finished
[50:00] Ministry without people
[50:03] knowing who he was
[50:07] especially the one that he was he has
[50:10] selected he pointed them one by
[50:13] one follow me follow me follow me like
[50:18] he has pointed
[50:20] us call us by his
[50:23] way follow me follow me follow me the
[50:28] reason is that now he wanted us to know
[50:33] him to know who he
[50:38] is unless if we don't know who he is
[50:42] that Ministry is not
[50:44] finished there was a time when they said
[50:48] to him tell us exactly who are you are
[50:53] you the Messiah or not
[50:57] he said to them I have
[51:00] displayed my life the things that I was
[51:04] doing tells you who am
[51:08] I right then he went on to his
[51:12] disciples but these people when they see
[51:15] me who do they say I
[51:20] am see they said no we are
[51:24] Jeremiah you know what they said
[51:27] then he knew that now my Ministry is not
[51:31] finished then he said what about
[51:34] you because you sleep with me you eat me
[51:39] you do
[51:40] everything what about you who do you say
[51:43] that I the son of
[51:46] man Peter said thou are the Christ the
[51:51] son of the Living God he gave him the
[51:54] keys it's that's SW my Ministry
[51:58] is I want them to
[52:00] know who am I so he said now there are
[52:03] the
[52:04] keys and then thereafter he changes the
[52:08] ministry that's what I want to I want to
[52:11] read
[52:12] now now in verse uh chapter 16 chapter
[52:16] 16 verse 21 verse 21
[52:21] remember when we were before we
[52:25] repented we were very much afraid of
[52:31] death and our
[52:34] parents uh displayed the fear of
[52:41] death I
[52:46] am I could still hear the squeaking of
[52:49] the voice of my
[52:53] aunt when there's death
[52:56] so it was something that was
[52:58] traumatizing
[53:01] me when I I know in the olden
[53:05] days you know that if maybe there is a a
[53:10] funeral passing by
[53:13] C you have to kneel
[53:16] down and put your head yeah on the
[53:21] head
[53:23] scared now what the Bible says
[53:27] says Jesus Christ you will read that
[53:31] one you will read it in in in in Hebrews
[53:34] chapter to start from verse 14 amen
[53:38] Hebrews 2:4 he says he became a
[53:43] man he took the form of he didn't take
[53:46] the form of an
[53:48] Angel no he became a human
[53:52] being and shed his
[53:55] blood to relieve those that were afraid
[53:58] of
[54:00] death those that were
[54:03] Bound by death now how did Death bound
[54:07] us we thought that that was the end of
[54:11] everything when somebody passed on we
[54:19] say that is not what God
[54:22] says okay let me come back to this now
[54:26] in verse 21 ver
[54:28] 21 okay
[54:31] firstly after that is after Peter
[54:36] said thou are the Christ the son of the
[54:38] Living
[54:39] God then the Bible says verse 20 ver
[54:44] then charge he his
[54:48] disciples that they should tell no
[54:52] man that he was Jesus the Christ
[54:57] now I said to you his
[55:00] ministry was not
[55:02] finished if they don't know who he
[55:05] was now after
[55:08] knowing actually it's not knowing after
[55:11] the
[55:13] revelation after it was revealed unto
[55:16] them then he said now tell no
[55:20] man now why does it say tell no
[55:23] man after the revelation
[55:27] it's because he said to Peter Flesh and
[55:32] Blood did not reveal that unto
[55:35] you so now if flesh and blood has not
[55:38] revealed
[55:39] that and then the other people also it
[55:43] should not be Flesh and
[55:45] Blood even if you can say this is the
[55:49] Messiah but if it's not revealed unto
[55:52] them they will still be doubtful
[55:56] let let them have a
[56:00] revelation now what is now once you have
[56:03] the
[56:04] Revelation then all fears
[56:10] vanish are we together because you could
[56:13] see
[56:16] beyond now if you see this side of
[56:20] life then you'll have
[56:23] fear
[56:25] look God
[56:28] I would say it doesn't worry so much
[56:30] about your
[56:36] flesh no he's worried about his word
[56:39] that is in that
[56:44] flesh when he send
[56:47] you like he sent John the
[56:51] Baptist when his ministry was
[56:54] finished God was finished with
[56:57] body they cut off his
[57:00] head a strong
[57:02] man how we together an anointed
[57:07] man but did they cut off his
[57:11] head right amen and we give it to a dam
[57:15] cell they display they display the most
[57:21] powerful
[57:23] Prophet point a messiah
[57:27] who who would
[57:30] say uh to
[57:32] Kings and
[57:35] princess and
[57:36] stand and proclaim the power of
[57:40] God but when the ministry is
[57:45] finished God takes his
[57:47] word so the power in you is the word of
[57:52] God that is in you
[57:56] are we
[57:57] together that is why
[57:59] Jesus
[58:03] said was the end of the
[58:06] ministry the angel was there to console
[58:10] him your
[58:12] Prophet when he died he was
[58:17] shuted the most powerful
[58:20] Prophet who could stand in the
[58:24] Gap and restore
[58:27] everything are we together
[58:29] amen m i
[58:31] mean
[58:34] Adam caused a
[58:37] crack in the
[58:40] will of
[58:42] Eternity there was a crack the only man
[58:46] that stood in that Gap and P up
[58:50] that is the prophet but but look how he
[58:54] died
[58:56] when his ministry is
[58:58] finished shut at there to show that
[59:03] there's nothing in
[59:05] this there's another life that you need
[59:09] to
[59:10] respect there is a life that comes from
[59:16] God
[59:17] now I wanted to read you this scripture
[59:20] I I read here he charged the angels I
[59:24] mean he charged his disciples
[59:27] that they should tell no
[59:28] man that he was
[59:30] Jesus the
[59:32] Christ right amen but he came so that
[59:37] people should know that he was
[59:40] Jesus the Christ and when the the
[59:43] disciples says yes you are Jesus
[59:47] Christ tell no
[59:51] man now that was the end
[59:56] of his
[59:57] ministry but then read verse
[1:00:00] 21 says from that time
[1:00:05] [Music]
[1:00:07] fourth began Jesus to show unto his
[1:00:14] disciples how that he must go unto
[1:00:19] Jerusalem and suffer many
[1:00:22] things of the elders and chief priests
[1:00:27] and and be
[1:00:29] killed you see it doesn't end
[1:00:32] there end be
[1:00:36] killed but then he continues now and be
[1:00:40] raised
[1:00:42] again the third
[1:00:44] day you see now he changes the ministry
[1:00:49] now that he's going to be
[1:00:52] killed but he's going to resurrect
[1:00:57] the the third
[1:00:59] day now uh in the olden
[1:01:03] days uh we
[1:01:06] had lot of churches
[1:01:09] also but the notorious
[1:01:13] ones of the
[1:01:15] Pharisees the
[1:01:18] the and the
[1:01:21] scribes
[1:01:23] now they will always
[1:01:26] challenge
[1:01:28] him about what he
[1:01:31] is they were
[1:01:33] Leed they knew the
[1:01:36] scriptures some of them were were
[1:01:40] professors they they will challenge him
[1:01:43] about his
[1:01:45] personality about his
[1:01:48] ministry yeah now the the the there was
[1:01:52] the s
[1:01:53] s how do you pronounce it s
[1:02:00] SES they did not believe in the
[1:02:05] resurrection they could defend
[1:02:08] that you remember they said to
[1:02:12] him you know that the law of
[1:02:16] Moses says that if a man get
[1:02:20] married and die his brother
[1:02:24] must the
[1:02:27] wife must take over the
[1:02:31] wife then he said yes it's like that
[1:02:35] said now there was a
[1:02:37] woman who lost a
[1:02:41] husband then the younger brother married
[1:02:45] her on and on and on and he also
[1:02:49] died the third one
[1:02:52] died to the seven
[1:02:56] now in
[1:02:57] heaven whose wife
[1:03:04] is that is why he
[1:03:07] said you don't know the
[1:03:11] scriptures because in heaven there's no
[1:03:17] marriage we we we are
[1:03:21] angels see now the Bible says
[1:03:26] oh oh in the Book of
[1:03:29] John our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:33] said I think it's in verse 63 John 6 62
[1:03:39] or 63 yeah go John
[1:03:43] 663
[1:03:45] yeah so now our
[1:03:48] ministry like that of our Lord Jesus
[1:03:52] Christ has got nothing to do with death
[1:03:58] because we have
[1:04:01] passed we are on that other side of
[1:04:05] that each and every one of
[1:04:08] us it can happen that you should
[1:04:12] go there are
[1:04:14] those that will be
[1:04:18] around until Rapture
[1:04:21] came until comes a time when our body is
[1:04:24] changed
[1:04:26] but uh the
[1:04:28] ministry in the Bible is based on the
[1:04:34] resurrection but now even if you
[1:04:38] die and death you know that is the
[1:04:43] separation as long as you have separated
[1:04:46] from this
[1:04:49] flesh and then there will be a time when
[1:04:52] it comes to
[1:04:54] Resurrection that you you will go back
[1:04:56] to your
[1:04:57] body and then when you go back to your
[1:05:00] body it's only then that there's a
[1:05:04] change are we together now what will
[1:05:08] make the
[1:05:10] change what will make the change let's
[1:05:13] read it verse
[1:05:14] 6 now let's read verse 63 it's already
[1:05:19] oh I've got five minutes 5
[1:05:23] minutes it is the spirit that Quicken
[1:05:27] it
[1:05:28] right remember that now now the second
[1:05:34] Adam the Bible says the first
[1:05:39] Adam was a living
[1:05:42] soul and the second
[1:05:45] Adam was a quickening
[1:05:49] spirit now quickening
[1:05:52] Spirit now is the one that will change
[1:05:54] your body
[1:05:57] it is the spirit that Quicken
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:01] it the flesh profited
[1:06:07] nothing are we
[1:06:09] aware that our
[1:06:11] flesh profited
[1:06:14] nothing right right but it continues
[1:06:19] says uh the the flesh profited
[1:06:24] nothing the words that I speak unto
[1:06:28] you you see what is
[1:06:31] important the
[1:06:33] words that I speak unto you now the
[1:06:37] words that are written in this Bible and
[1:06:41] he says and they are
[1:06:44] alive they are
[1:06:46] spirit and they are alive the words that
[1:06:49] he
[1:06:51] spoke did not end up him speaking
[1:06:55] those words are the very same one that
[1:06:57] are in this
[1:07:00] Bible those words are the very same one
[1:07:03] that we are
[1:07:04] reading he says they are
[1:07:08] spirits and and they are
[1:07:13] life so what is
[1:07:16] life life is the
[1:07:18] word if if you go to to the Book of
[1:07:22] John chapter 8
[1:07:27] verse
[1:07:30] 37 have you ever read that
[1:07:33] one John chapter
[1:07:35] 8 now verse
[1:07:38] 37 then he says I know that you Abraham
[1:07:44] seed but he seek to kill
[1:07:47] me because my word had no place in you
[1:07:57] the
[1:07:58] resurrection has got to
[1:08:02] do with those
[1:08:04] words that they should find a place in
[1:08:09] you and when those words find a place in
[1:08:13] you the Bible
[1:08:16] says the the word of God is the
[1:08:21] seed right now if the word of God is the
[1:08:24] seed
[1:08:26] definitely that seat must
[1:08:29] germinate and that seat must
[1:08:33] germinate that word is the word of God
[1:08:37] now if it
[1:08:39] germinates it should form
[1:08:42] God because it's the word of
[1:08:45] God so the word give birth to the word
[1:08:52] now the word cannot die
[1:08:56] I are we together the word cannot
[1:09:00] die if in your
[1:09:03] heart which is in your
[1:09:06] soul then there's a word of
[1:09:09] God that word will
[1:09:12] germinate and form the
[1:09:15] weight this body is just a
[1:09:20] field where the seed is
[1:09:24] planted because he says there was a
[1:09:27] s that went on to S A
[1:09:31] SE some
[1:09:33] seed fell into the
[1:09:35] road then it was eaten by birs the other
[1:09:40] field
[1:09:42] seed on the
[1:09:44] stones which there was no moisture there
[1:09:48] the other
[1:09:50] seed uh at the wrong place where they
[1:09:53] were squashed
[1:09:56] germinated but they were
[1:09:59] squashed but now the good I mean the the
[1:10:02] right
[1:10:03] seed is the one that fell on the good
[1:10:08] ground and the good
[1:10:10] ground is our
[1:10:12] hearts are we together and our hearts
[1:10:16] goes hand in hand with
[1:10:20] predestination God cannot create you
[1:10:25] just for
[1:10:27] fun there is a
[1:10:29] reason why you are here and there is a
[1:10:33] reason why he's going to destroy this
[1:10:38] world and now the reason for you to be
[1:10:42] here is for him to plant his seat
[1:10:46] to and when he has planted his seat to
[1:10:49] you actually you are here to display him
[1:10:57] because he says he that
[1:11:01] overcome he displays his
[1:11:04] seat in you so that you could
[1:11:08] overcome the evil
[1:11:11] spirit are we together then he gives a
[1:11:15] promise that if you
[1:11:17] overcome I will give you this now to you
[1:11:22] who are in this time that you are living
[1:11:24] in
[1:11:26] he says if you
[1:11:27] overcome I will come and sit with
[1:11:31] you in my father's
[1:11:35] Throne as I as I have also
[1:11:38] over and I'm sitting at my
[1:11:41] father's are we together now now as
[1:11:46] Overcomers we have overcome the
[1:11:49] world we have overcome the system of the
[1:11:53] world now as overcome us death can never
[1:11:58] touch
[1:12:00] us our God is not the god of
[1:12:04] death no our God is God of
[1:12:10] life and the Bible
[1:12:12] says he that find
[1:12:16] me has find life now that we have found
[1:12:20] him we are
[1:12:22] alive and we will never never die
[1:12:27] are we together the flesh will die but
[1:12:32] we will never die because we are not
[1:12:37] that
