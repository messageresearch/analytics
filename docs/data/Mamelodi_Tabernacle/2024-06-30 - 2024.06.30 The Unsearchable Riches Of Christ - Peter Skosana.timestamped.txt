[1:24:46] all amen
[1:24:50] amen okay
[1:24:54] my
[1:24:56] title is based in uh I think there's a
[1:24:59] verse
[1:25:01] here verse verse eight brother verse
[1:25:05] eight unto me who am less than the least
[1:25:09] of All Saints in this Grace GI is this
[1:25:13] Grace given that I shall preach among
[1:25:16] the Gentiles the unable Riches of Christ
[1:25:20] yeah that's the title The
[1:25:22] unsearchable Riches
[1:25:24] of Christ that's the title that I want
[1:25:28] us to Fellowship
[1:25:38] about
[1:25:40] uh these things I mean they they've got
[1:25:43] to do with the time that we we are
[1:25:46] living
[1:25:48] [Music]
[1:25:50] in uh we are living at the end
[1:25:56] time now when we say end
[1:26:01] time we uh referring to the end of the
[1:26:05] Gentile
[1:26:08] [Music]
[1:26:12] dispensation right and then while we we
[1:26:16] are talking about the end of the Gentile
[1:26:19] dispensation
[1:26:24] then there are
[1:26:28] some different
[1:26:32] dispensations let's take our Prophet
[1:26:36] brother
[1:26:39] Brenham just you were singing a song
[1:26:44] here it says behold I send you Elijah
[1:26:48] the
[1:26:51] prophet before the great and Dreadful
[1:26:53] day of of the
[1:26:57] Lord and He will change the heart of uh
[1:27:01] the fathers to their
[1:27:06] children and their children to their
[1:27:10] fathers now that that's what we called
[1:27:13] different
[1:27:17] dispensation so our uh Prophet brother
[1:27:21] Brenham
[1:27:24] change the hearts of the children to
[1:27:29] their
[1:27:34] fathers it's it's it's a
[1:27:37] [Music]
[1:27:38] dispensation yeah it's a it's a
[1:27:42] commission that he should change the
[1:27:46] ministry his
[1:27:47] ministry was to change the
[1:27:51] heart of the children
[1:27:55] to their fathers and then what else
[1:28:02] thereafter
[1:28:04] now he he was given a new
[1:28:09] Commission of which now that new
[1:28:14] commission is the one now that causes a
[1:28:22] separation because now once you stick to
[1:28:26] changing their heart of the children to
[1:28:30] their
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:36] fathers and stop
[1:28:38] there and then you've missed the
[1:28:44] Target because there's another
[1:28:47] one which is not
[1:28:52] written remember it's not in the
[1:28:57] book it's a new
[1:29:00] commission but not that new
[1:29:05] commission uh is what we call the third
[1:29:08] pool it's what we call the seventh
[1:29:12] SE they they just run
[1:29:16] concurrently they go on
[1:29:20] simultaneously it is the seventh
[1:29:22] seal which is the
[1:29:25] pool and then we've got the
[1:29:27] manifestations of the sons of
[1:29:31] God we've got the revelation of the son
[1:29:33] of
[1:29:36] man now these are different
[1:29:40] dispensations but they run
[1:29:44] simultaneously then if you miss
[1:29:48] them you miss the
[1:29:51] Target because after after I have turned
[1:29:55] the heart of the
[1:29:59] children to the
[1:30:01] fathers then then comes a new
[1:30:07] commission no the new
[1:30:09] commission is the thir
[1:30:11] pool and now that thir
[1:30:16] pool uh it's not for the
[1:30:20] public now if if it's not for the public
[1:30:25] which means it's
[1:30:27] hidden now how do we come to it how do
[1:30:30] we come to the
[1:30:33] understanding that's why now Paul speaks
[1:30:37] about the unable
[1:30:45] riches now I was checking this with
[1:30:50] unsearchable or let me start with
[1:30:52] mystery
[1:30:54] you go to the
[1:30:56] dictionary it says mystery it's
[1:30:58] something that is
[1:31:03] difficult or
[1:31:06] impossible to understand or to
[1:31:10] explain now it's a mystery it's for
[1:31:15] you right am then I check the word
[1:31:20] unchange I
[1:31:22] mean un
[1:31:30] then it means
[1:31:34] hidden something that cannot be
[1:31:36] understood by by
[1:31:42] searching you cannot search it until you
[1:31:45] find
[1:31:48] it now Paul
[1:31:50] says he
[1:31:52] preach the
[1:31:54] searchable
[1:32:00] riches something that is
[1:32:03] hidden is supposed to preach
[1:32:06] it now if you could check
[1:32:09] Paul he laid the foundation of chur of
[1:32:14] the
[1:32:15] church that was not
[1:32:19] all and
[1:32:21] thereafter he went into different
[1:32:26] mention see he said I know a man in thir
[1:32:31] heaven now now that's another
[1:32:36] Ministry after he laid the
[1:32:39] foundation took every he took the
[1:32:42] church and laid
[1:32:45] found
[1:32:47] position that everybody find his
[1:32:50] position in the
[1:32:52] church then from
[1:32:55] and if you can you can check
[1:32:58] Paul what he preaches to the
[1:33:01] Galatians and the Corinthians is not
[1:33:04] what he preaches to the
[1:33:08] Ephesians so that's why now we read the
[1:33:10] book of
[1:33:12] Ephesians where he speaks about the
[1:33:14] unable
[1:33:17] riches but then
[1:33:20] then we have a Ministry
[1:33:24] of the time that you are living
[1:33:26] in we cannot go
[1:33:28] back after the opening of the
[1:33:33] seven and go to the
[1:33:36] things we've got these hidden
[1:33:40] things that are for
[1:33:43] us which if you approach them with your
[1:33:46] human
[1:33:49] mind it it becomes a difficult thing
[1:33:53] that's why during the time of
[1:33:56] Paul they said now his
[1:34:00] messages are
[1:34:04] difficult why what makes it
[1:34:08] [Music]
[1:34:10] difficult because it doesn't need your
[1:34:14] mind it needs a revelation from
[1:34:17] God now once you try try to scratch your
[1:34:22] head
[1:34:27] and bringing a human
[1:34:31] understanding it will crush
[1:34:34] you because it it has got it its
[1:34:41] Channel it moves in that
[1:34:44] channel and then there's a throne of God
[1:34:47] in
[1:34:49] you now when God want to communicate
[1:34:52] with you
[1:34:55] goes to his
[1:34:56] throne and what what what he want to
[1:34:59] give
[1:35:00] you it must go according to that
[1:35:04] [Applause]
[1:35:06] chel it had nothing to do with your own
[1:35:09] [Applause]
[1:35:13] mind are we are we
[1:35:15] together now you've got your
[1:35:20] inheritance now our inheritance
[1:35:24] are in another
[1:35:27] dimension and in order to reach that
[1:35:33] inheritance we not we need to go through
[1:35:35] that
[1:35:38] Dimension are we together and then once
[1:35:41] we miss that
[1:35:44] Dimension it becomes a
[1:35:49] difficulty are we together
[1:35:54] uh let me give you an
[1:35:57] example there was a
[1:36:00] time when
[1:36:05] Prophet was
[1:36:08] with right amen they were looking at the
[1:36:12] same thing together both of
[1:36:16] them but they were seeing different
[1:36:22] things a
[1:36:25] Elisha saw the Chariots of
[1:36:29] Fire saw
[1:36:31] [Applause]
[1:36:35] angels saw Chariots of
[1:36:40] enemies are we together they're looking
[1:36:43] at one
[1:36:45] thing one see it From Another
[1:36:48] [Applause]
[1:36:50] Dimension the other one see it from
[1:36:52] another dimension
[1:36:55] are we
[1:36:57] together so now
[1:37:00] until Elisha
[1:37:02] said Lord open his
[1:37:07] eyes but his eyes were
[1:37:14] open he had his eyes open both of them
[1:37:19] they were their eyes were
[1:37:22] open but said Lord open his
[1:37:26] [Applause]
[1:37:27] eyes now we can all be sitting
[1:37:31] here hearing from the same
[1:37:35] preacher but hearing different
[1:37:38] [Applause]
[1:37:40] things because our
[1:37:43] inheritance are in a certain
[1:37:47] Dimension and when the
[1:37:50] preacher goes behind the ppit
[1:37:54] he preaches from a certain
[1:37:58] Dimension and then if you you are in
[1:38:01] that
[1:38:04] Dimension if you are not in that
[1:38:06] Dimension it preaches something that you
[1:38:09] are not
[1:38:11] in but if you are in that
[1:38:16] Dimension and then you will go
[1:38:20] together now here comes a question
[1:38:24] how does it
[1:38:26] come that
[1:38:28] now you'll be sitting here seeing things
[1:38:32] from different
[1:38:36] dimensions the ministry of the seven
[1:38:41] SE uh it has to do with our
[1:38:47] inheritance and with our
[1:38:51] theop it's an angel Angelic
[1:38:57] Ministry an Angelic
[1:39:00] Ministry we are crossing
[1:39:07] Dimensions look this the Bible
[1:39:11] says the angel of the
[1:39:14] Lord is encamping
[1:39:20] us now that that angel that is in
[1:39:23] camping
[1:39:25] us it's nothing else but the revealed
[1:39:32] word when he says when he say when the
[1:39:35] prophet
[1:39:36] says the word is now in the
[1:39:42] bright he start by saying here is the
[1:39:47] mystery you see it's a mystery the word
[1:39:51] is now in the bright
[1:39:55] now what is the
[1:39:58] we in the beginning was the
[1:40:01] we the word was with
[1:40:04] God the Word was
[1:40:07] God in other ways now God is in his
[1:40:12] throne that is why he says he who
[1:40:18] overcometh talking to
[1:40:20] us in thean church
[1:40:24] he that
[1:40:25] overcome see I will grant him to sit
[1:40:29] with me in my
[1:40:33] Throne now he is in his
[1:40:36] throne where in our
[1:40:39] hearts in which way in the form of the
[1:40:43] revealed
[1:40:46] way so when he says Lord
[1:40:50] open his eyes
[1:40:53] the prophet
[1:40:54] says God opened his
[1:41:01] seeing because his eyes were
[1:41:05] open see and then thereafter he was able
[1:41:09] to
[1:41:11] see the things that are in another
[1:41:15] dimension now the prophet
[1:41:17] says right
[1:41:19] now there are people among
[1:41:24] us that you cannot see they in another
[1:41:30] D at times it does
[1:41:33] happen that one screams
[1:41:36] here right and some Elders take him to
[1:41:40] pray for
[1:41:42] him and then when they pray for him they
[1:41:45] would say I've seen 1 2 3
[1:41:48] 4 how come we didn't see it
[1:41:54] okay last week or two weeks back I don't
[1:41:58] know somebody said you was calling me at
[1:42:02] home he was calling me at
[1:42:05] home he said no we had a
[1:42:08] stranger somebody that visited
[1:42:12] us he was sitting in front of
[1:42:16] me and that man stood
[1:42:20] up and came and pressed me on my
[1:42:26] shoulders so I said now where were the
[1:42:29] other
[1:42:30] people he said the other people were
[1:42:32] saying amen the preacher was
[1:42:35] preaching this man was pressing
[1:42:38] me and I know he's a visitor I don't
[1:42:41] know
[1:42:43] him now
[1:42:46] if I it wasn't
[1:42:48] myself I would say no you're
[1:42:51] mad out of your
[1:42:55] mind no she is
[1:42:58] right some people do that through other
[1:43:04] dimensions okay I'm I'm not on that
[1:43:07] now my my my my
[1:43:10] my sermon
[1:43:13] here it has to
[1:43:16] do with what people call
[1:43:22] difficult because of their approach to
[1:43:28] the they want to
[1:43:32] understand instead of having a
[1:43:37] revelation
[1:43:39] understanding has to do with a
[1:43:42] university
[1:43:45] book which you must read and
[1:43:48] understand and go and write your
[1:43:51] exams but the word of
[1:43:54] God goes hand in
[1:43:56] hand with a
[1:43:58] revelation and the
[1:44:01] Revelation has to do with the
[1:44:07] predestination right amen now
[1:44:11] predestination it's not your
[1:44:15] choice it's a
[1:44:17] process when God processed
[1:44:21] himself he process what was in his
[1:44:25] mind now the Bible says the very same
[1:44:29] Paul said we were in
[1:44:33] him before the foundation of the
[1:44:38] world now if we were in
[1:44:43] him how does Paul know that we were in
[1:44:47] him because he hasn't even met Jesus
[1:44:51] Christ physically
[1:44:55] he says we were in him before the
[1:44:58] foundation of
[1:45:00] the you see it came through Revelation I
[1:45:04] will show you
[1:45:07] amen uh there was a
[1:45:11] day in Luke uh uh 4 verse
[1:45:16] 21 I would like my brother to read
[1:45:21] it now these issues of crossing
[1:45:25] different
[1:45:29] dimensions it's not something that you
[1:45:31] could scratch your head and try to say
[1:45:33] how does you jump from one dimension to
[1:45:42] another now just verse 21 only verse 21
[1:45:47] Luke 4:
[1:45:49] 21 and he began to say unto them this
[1:45:53] this day is this scripture fulfilled in
[1:45:55] your ears now here what happened is
[1:46:01] this Jesus was given a
[1:46:05] book he read a
[1:46:08] book and after reading a
[1:46:11] book that was uh he read where it it
[1:46:16] speaks about
[1:46:19] him actually he was expressing himself
[1:46:25] look our Lord Jesus
[1:46:27] Christ never said I
[1:46:32] am that son of
[1:46:37] Mary and Joseph of which you don't
[1:46:40] understand how how am I called the Son
[1:46:44] of
[1:46:48] God he never tried to explain those
[1:46:51] things
[1:46:55] because he knew that that was for a
[1:46:57] certain
[1:47:01] CL when when he called Peter he never
[1:47:05] tried to explain to
[1:47:08] Peter just called him and say
[1:47:12] come right amen now when he was reading
[1:47:17] about
[1:47:19] himself now people were trying to
[1:47:23] understand
[1:47:25] him they were LED
[1:47:27] people they know their
[1:47:31] scriptures so they they tried they tried
[1:47:34] to analyze
[1:47:36] him what's wrong with this young
[1:47:40] man so now he
[1:47:44] said this
[1:47:46] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:47:51] years
[1:47:54] you hear and you see it's a fulfillment
[1:47:58] of the scripture what what I've just
[1:48:01] read speaks about me but he never said
[1:48:05] like I'm
[1:48:06] doing just read it and unfold
[1:48:09] it the
[1:48:11] hearing the
[1:48:15] understanding the
[1:48:18] assumptions comes from
[1:48:21] them it was pulling of its
[1:48:25] own it's it's like the third
[1:48:28] pull it pulls of its
[1:48:32] own it has nothing to do with
[1:48:36] understanding no you were in his
[1:48:40] mind you were processed from his
[1:48:44] mind now if you are office it's you says
[1:48:47] my
[1:48:48] ship
[1:48:50] know my voice
[1:48:53] when he
[1:48:53] speaks there's something that pulls
[1:48:58] you are you
[1:49:01] together the other example that I can
[1:49:03] give
[1:49:04] you there were two of his
[1:49:08] disciples they were going to
[1:49:11] ous and they were talking about
[1:49:16] him now those were his
[1:49:19] disciples they slept with him
[1:49:23] they act with him they saw him raising
[1:49:28] T and lazaros they saw him walking upon
[1:49:32] the
[1:49:33] sea are we together they saw him
[1:49:37] multiplying the bread and
[1:49:40] [Music]
[1:49:42] fish but they were talking about
[1:49:45] him and he came and stood with them and
[1:49:48] said what are you talking about
[1:49:52] and then why did they say oh it is
[1:49:57] you so they saw a
[1:50:03] stranger now the only
[1:50:05] way that he can tell them who he
[1:50:12] was then they will change from the
[1:50:15] dimension that they are
[1:50:18] [Music]
[1:50:19] in he started quoting scriptures
[1:50:22] [Music]
[1:50:24] from
[1:50:25] Moses go and read it it says it was
[1:50:28] pulling
[1:50:29] them it says our hearts SP as I
[1:50:34] was see he was calling he was he was
[1:50:38] pulling of of of of I mean he was
[1:50:41] talking to to to
[1:50:43] those that are of
[1:50:46] him it's only the word that can attract
[1:50:49] them
[1:50:53] so he was he was pulling them by the
[1:50:59] way and then
[1:51:01] until they arrive at a m a
[1:51:05] mouse now to say to them I you satisfied
[1:51:09] that I
[1:51:13] him he took
[1:51:15] [Applause]
[1:51:18] bread when he took
[1:51:21] bread then they saw
[1:51:24] him now I'm talking about changing
[1:51:30] dimensions and then did he
[1:51:33] vanish it was not a
[1:51:36] [Music]
[1:51:38] ghost spoke right am so what happened to
[1:51:43] to these
[1:51:47] disciples then it was revealed unto them
[1:51:52] that he said we should meet in
[1:51:57] gilee then that thing pulled him to
[1:52:01] Gile he never said to them go to
[1:52:04] G
[1:52:06] no he just fokes about he just spoke
[1:52:09] about
[1:52:11] himself they had a
[1:52:14] revelation of what was his last
[1:52:19] way right amen so he appeared unto
[1:52:24] them in another
[1:52:27] form and revealed
[1:52:30] himself through the we
[1:52:33] remember our Lord Jesus Christ was here
[1:52:37] to
[1:52:40] manifest the
[1:52:42] we when the word says a virgin shall
[1:52:48] conceive he didn't say
[1:52:51] yes the Bible says the Virgin shall
[1:52:53] conceive and bear a
[1:52:57] son he didn't say I am that
[1:53:00] son no he
[1:53:04] manifested until they could see
[1:53:07] them you could see him by his
[1:53:15] manifestation because he start by uh
[1:53:19] first pool second pool or the third pool
[1:53:24] what I want to say
[1:53:26] that Peter
[1:53:29] said he went he said now our Lord Jesus
[1:53:33] Christ his
[1:53:35] soul went to hell and go and
[1:53:39] preach to the souls that repented
[1:53:44] not in the days of Noah it's written
[1:53:48] that's written by
[1:53:51] Peter where where was
[1:53:54] Peter when the soul of our Lord Jesus
[1:53:58] Christ went to
[1:54:01] hell Peter was fishing
[1:54:05] there after our Lord Jesus Christ was
[1:54:10] crucified Peter said oh he's gone he's
[1:54:13] gone I'm going for
[1:54:15] fishing for fishing but now he's the one
[1:54:18] that says his soul was in hell
[1:54:23] how did he know that because he was
[1:54:28] fishing now I'm trying to show
[1:54:33] you that it has nothing to
[1:54:36] do with your your your your human
[1:54:41] mind God
[1:54:43] came and revealed that
[1:54:46] to and Peter
[1:54:49] wrote It's like Moses he wrote the Book
[1:54:52] of
[1:54:53] Genesis says in the
[1:54:56] beginning God
[1:54:58] created heaven and before
[1:55:02] everything where was
[1:55:05] [Applause]
[1:55:06] Moses how did he know he never went to
[1:55:10] any school to
[1:55:11] go and whoever can write
[1:55:16] that must must get it from somebody
[1:55:20] else if they say somebody's a
[1:55:23] scholar he has read big
[1:55:26] books it's an information from somebody
[1:55:32] else he will get that
[1:55:34] information and create his own
[1:55:38] information see but yeah are unable
[1:55:46] riches it's when God
[1:55:49] himself visits you and expose
[1:55:56] himself are we
[1:55:58] together how did Peter
[1:56:01] know that Jesus went to
[1:56:07] preach to the souls in
[1:56:10] Hell how how did you know
[1:56:13] that okay let's let's continue now the
[1:56:16] the unsearchable riches it's it's
[1:56:19] something that is not written
[1:56:26] it's it's out of the
[1:56:28] book says the book was
[1:56:32] written
[1:56:33] within and
[1:56:37] without now what was
[1:56:42] without that is what we called the third
[1:56:46] pool that's what we call the the the the
[1:56:50] the seventh SE
[1:56:53] the Bible speaks right
[1:56:56] now right in your
[1:56:59] eyes and in your
[1:57:02] ears if you go to book of Romans chapter
[1:57:05] 8 verse 19 don't read it you know it it
[1:57:10] speaks about the it says the
[1:57:14] nature is
[1:57:16] grumbling the nature Waiting For
[1:57:21] What
[1:57:23] manifestations of the sons of God what
[1:57:26] is the manifestations of the sons of
[1:57:30] God it's when
[1:57:33] God manifest
[1:57:36] himself in his
[1:57:39] bright how does God manifest himself in
[1:57:43] his
[1:57:45] PR because God will be in a human
[1:57:51] being and doing his
[1:57:53] job in a human
[1:57:56] being what is that how does he manifest
[1:58:01] himself okay we talk about and then we
[1:58:05] we we talk about the revelation of the
[1:58:10] son of
[1:58:14] man now he
[1:58:17] came to the
[1:58:19] Jews as a son of men
[1:58:25] God in a man he came to the
[1:58:30] Gentiles as the Son of God the Holy
[1:58:33] Ghost is
[1:58:36] it right and then
[1:58:39] after he
[1:58:42] has done the job of the Holy
[1:58:46] Ghost then he
[1:58:48] came as a son of man still to the
[1:58:53] Gentiles that is why now the time that
[1:58:55] you are living
[1:58:56] in he he is the son of man he is the
[1:59:01] revealed
[1:59:03] way what is he
[1:59:07] doing can we see what is he
[1:59:09] doing as as as the son of man yes we
[1:59:13] we're talking about the seventh
[1:59:15] seal we're talking about the third
[1:59:19] pool but now they should be you know our
[1:59:22] Lord Jesus
[1:59:25] Christ was uh manifesting the
[1:59:30] weight and then when he was manifesting
[1:59:32] the
[1:59:33] we they said to
[1:59:36] him H you should have a
[1:59:44] witness that's somebody that can
[1:59:47] say yes this is the son of God
[1:59:52] and then prove
[1:59:55] it I I prove then he said no I bear a
[2:00:00] record of
[2:00:03] myself you hear what he
[2:00:05] says I bear record of
[2:00:09] myself because now who was talking then
[2:00:12] or who was speaking by
[2:00:14] then it was Christ and who is
[2:00:19] Christ Christ was not created
[2:00:23] and Christ was not
[2:00:25] born Christ is the Son of God Christ is
[2:00:29] the
[2:00:29] logos Christ is the
[2:00:33] word so the word bear record of
[2:00:38] [Applause]
[2:00:41] himself that is the Son of God the
[2:00:44] pillar of fire the W Christ himself I
[2:00:48] bear record of myself who else can
[2:00:54] because I'm the first and the
[2:00:56] last I'm Alpha and I'm
[2:01:01] Omega who can says he knows me better I
[2:01:05] bear record of
[2:01:07] myself now when you talk about the third
[2:01:10] pool is when you bear record of
[2:01:15] yourself there's nobody that knows
[2:01:19] you because you processed from
[2:01:22] [Applause]
[2:01:24] go you'll bear record of
[2:01:28] yourself because worldly
[2:01:31] people cannot understand
[2:01:35] you because they they approach you with
[2:01:40] Earthly
[2:01:42] understanding
[2:01:44] meanwhile you have a divine
[2:01:49] nature are we together
[2:01:52] now having a divine
[2:01:55] nature having we are having a
[2:01:58] supernatural
[2:02:00] understanding that's what we call
[2:02:03] now another
[2:02:08] body now Paul speaks about body
[2:02:13] terrestrial and body
[2:02:17] [Music]
[2:02:19] Celestial 1 Corinthians chapter 15
[2:02:22] that's I don't read it you know it yeah
[2:02:25] you know it body
[2:02:29] Terr and
[2:02:33] body where did he get
[2:02:37] that how does we know that we've got a
[2:02:40] physical body
[2:02:42] here and after we die we get another
[2:02:47] body and then in heaven we've got a
[2:02:50] glorified
[2:02:53] you see it's the
[2:02:56] process it comes from
[2:02:58] eternity okay I'll read you what the
[2:03:01] Bible I mean the prophet
[2:03:03] says
[2:03:05] okay he says
[2:03:08] here speaking with brother brother
[2:03:10] Brenham says here in this book what is a
[2:03:16] vision he said you see the first
[2:03:20] pool it's when you use to put your hands
[2:03:23] on the people and tell them what's their
[2:03:28] trouble I'm reading paragraph
[2:03:32] 98 then the second pool was when we know
[2:03:36] the secrets of their
[2:03:38] heart like I told
[2:03:41] you right then he goes
[2:03:45] on God now brother Bram is speaking to
[2:03:48] God
[2:03:49] now says God now if somebody says he
[2:03:53] speaking to
[2:03:56] God so if I'm speaking to Brother P here
[2:04:01] he's here I'm
[2:04:03] here now if somebody says God spoke to
[2:04:08] me you must know that that
[2:04:11] person is a great person before
[2:04:16] God now now this
[2:04:20] Prophet you will see that
[2:04:23] now him and God were
[2:04:26] friends God will speak to
[2:04:29] him what he
[2:04:32] says uh the second pull was when you
[2:04:35] know the secrets of the
[2:04:38] heart like I told
[2:04:40] you and said instead of keeping instead
[2:04:44] of you keeping that to
[2:04:47] yourself it's called now speaking to
[2:04:50] brother br say instead of you keeping
[2:04:55] these things to
[2:04:57] yourself you try to explain all about
[2:05:03] it that's God telling
[2:05:07] brother and tell
[2:05:10] people now he's saying to the prophet
[2:05:14] you shouldn't have told
[2:05:15] people and this man is supposed to
[2:05:19] preach and tell people so that people
[2:05:22] could believe that and then from down
[2:05:25] they must believe
[2:05:27] God now why does God say you shouldn't
[2:05:30] have told
[2:05:33] [Applause]
[2:05:36] them and when you
[2:05:40] did you didn't know nothing about it
[2:05:46] yourself that's called now rebuking
[2:05:49] brother
[2:05:52] amen and how could you explain
[2:05:56] it because you got it from me you don't
[2:05:59] know anything about
[2:06:01] it now how would you explain my
[2:06:05] thing and yet is a
[2:06:09] prophet behold I sent you Elijah the
[2:06:13] prophet right he must turn our
[2:06:17] hearts and you've cost a big bunch of
[2:06:20] caral impers
[2:06:24] [Music]
[2:06:26] to rise up and you see what you've
[2:06:29] done no that is God saying to his
[2:06:34] Prophet look now you made a
[2:06:38] mess
[2:06:41] right and then he said Lord I'm
[2:06:46] sorry where did they meet when they were
[2:06:49] they were communicating about this
[2:06:53] was he sitting somewhere and then they
[2:06:55] had this
[2:06:57] [Music]
[2:06:57] [Applause]
[2:07:00] communication right amen and he said I'm
[2:07:04] sorry I don't know what to
[2:07:07] do then it goes
[2:07:11] on in this book says is this the
[2:07:14] time the time I think it's paragraph
[2:07:17] 392
[2:07:20] 392 then he said says you remember the
[2:07:22] third
[2:07:23] pool you remember what
[2:07:26] happened I tried to explain
[2:07:30] it he said don't do
[2:07:34] that things are
[2:07:36] happening you get
[2:07:39] excited say okay let me tell the
[2:07:43] church then he says don't do
[2:07:46] that why why did he he showed him this
[2:07:51] things
[2:07:53] I will I'll show you says don't do
[2:07:56] that and then with a second P
[2:08:00] says don't
[2:08:02] try and I pulled
[2:08:05] anyhow you all
[2:08:08] remember then he
[2:08:11] continues and then he said now there's a
[2:08:14] third pool coming but don't try to
[2:08:16] explain
[2:08:22] now you can get confused
[2:08:25] with now he's giving me
[2:08:28] that said I must not explaining and
[2:08:31] people are going to ask me
[2:08:35] questions then I then you see now I
[2:08:39] approach this
[2:08:43] tonight I don't know but I feel Duty
[2:08:48] bound to my church to say
[2:08:53] something you draw your own
[2:08:58] conclusion right amen now with this be
[2:09:02] the
[2:09:05] mystery that will open
[2:09:08] up that will bring
[2:09:11] Christ bring a power to the
[2:09:14] church so now is this the sign that's
[2:09:17] what that's what that's where I was
[2:09:19] reading
[2:09:21] now let's go back now to
[2:09:25] Paul we read the first
[2:09:28] verse we explain what are the
[2:09:35] riches the riches is the
[2:09:39] inheritance your
[2:09:41] inheritance is when you are
[2:09:46] reinstated to your place where you come
[2:09:48] from
[2:09:51] have you ever read
[2:09:54] uh The Book of John chapter 6 that one
[2:09:58] you can
[2:10:00] read chapter 6 verse 62 John 6 verse
[2:10:07] 62
[2:10:08] now your your your
[2:10:12] inheritance is in another
[2:10:17] dimension and then your your riches are
[2:10:20] the inheritance you got it my brother
[2:10:23] Sir John
[2:10:26] 6:62 what and if he shall see the son of
[2:10:30] man as sent up where he was before where
[2:10:33] he was
[2:10:35] before that's that's what Christ said
[2:10:38] said
[2:10:40] what and
[2:10:42] if he shall see the son of man as
[2:10:47] send went
[2:10:49] up where he was
[2:10:51] before where was he
[2:10:56] before where was the son of man
[2:11:00] before because the son of
[2:11:03] man was
[2:11:05] Christ then what does Christ come
[2:11:09] from now if you could say Christ is the
[2:11:12] second
[2:11:15] person he will be leaving his father in
[2:11:19] Heaven the very same Christ that
[2:11:24] descended is the very same one that will
[2:11:28] go back where you
[2:11:30] was now with a human
[2:11:34] mind thing Heaven is a certain
[2:11:39] place where where go when God left that
[2:11:43] place it remains empty or with body
[2:11:48] guards until he comes back
[2:11:51] now
[2:11:53] God is
[2:11:57] omnipresent we are here now we are here
[2:11:59] now God is in
[2:12:02] Elizabeth God is with the
[2:12:05] p God
[2:12:07] is with with brother Reed where he
[2:12:12] is with all the
[2:12:15] brothers so his omn
[2:12:17] presentent now he says what and if
[2:12:22] you see the son of
[2:12:24] man
[2:12:26] Ascend and go back where you
[2:12:28] are now your
[2:12:31] inheritance is when you go
[2:12:33] back where you come
[2:12:37] from we together and then where you come
[2:12:42] from
[2:12:43] and where you are right now with the I
[2:12:48] was asking you where did Moses get this
[2:12:52] where did Peter get this where did Paul
[2:12:56] get this they get it from their place
[2:13:00] they ascended
[2:13:03] supernaturally and and find and find
[2:13:06] their
[2:13:08] inheritance and then they were in a
[2:13:11] place where they will know
[2:13:14] everything are we together where God
[2:13:17] reveals everything
[2:13:21] it
[2:13:22] was when Moses says in the beginning
[2:13:26] then he had to go to the
[2:13:29] beginning and see the beginning where he
[2:13:32] was with God when he was
[2:13:36] creating when he says in the beginning
[2:13:39] God created heaven and
[2:13:41] earth then he was
[2:13:43] there and in the Book of John when the
[2:13:47] Bible says in the beginning was the way
[2:13:51] then he himself have to be the way in
[2:13:55] order to write about the
[2:13:58] way and then he he has to be in that
[2:14:03] beginning and bring forth that
[2:14:07] thing now Paul says here you hear what
[2:14:11] is saying okay fine let's go to verse
[2:14:13] two then Ephesians chapter
[2:14:17] 3 we are talking about the unable
[2:14:23] the
[2:14:24] hidden that cannot be
[2:14:27] understood by
[2:14:30] searching you cannot understand because
[2:14:32] you
[2:14:35] searched it is beyond your
[2:14:40] understanding if you have verse two it
[2:14:42] says if you have heard of the
[2:14:45] dispensation of Grace
[2:14:51] dispensation of the grace of
[2:14:55] God which is given
[2:14:59] me to you
[2:15:02] what so in other words God gave him the
[2:15:08] dispensation of
[2:15:11] Grace he says now I have received this
[2:15:17] dispensation because of
[2:15:19] you that's why
[2:15:22] it's you it's another English
[2:15:25] here King James
[2:15:27] Vision it says giv me to you
[2:15:33] what which means now uh giving me
[2:15:37] because of
[2:15:38] [Music]
[2:15:40] you now God didn't give
[2:15:44] you he gave me because of you
[2:15:50] [Applause]
[2:15:52] right amen then the second the third
[2:15:55] verse how
[2:15:57] that by
[2:15:59] Revelation he made known unto
[2:16:03] [Music]
[2:16:05] me he made
[2:16:07] known unto me by
[2:16:11] Revelation the mystery what is a
[2:16:14] mystery something that is
[2:16:18] difficult or impossible
[2:16:21] to understand or to explain now he says
[2:16:26] he gave me my
[2:16:30] Revelation amen verse verse three how
[2:16:34] that by Revelation he made known unto
[2:16:39] me the
[2:16:41] mystery and if you have your your Bibles
[2:16:43] there it is I could see it it has a
[2:16:46] close amen what do you call
[2:16:49] that brackets then from the one let's
[2:16:52] read between the says as I
[2:16:59] WR in few
[2:17:01] words and it goes to to to verse four
[2:17:04] the the bracket is still still
[2:17:07] s whereby when you read you may
[2:17:12] understand my
[2:17:15] knowledge in the mystery of Christ
[2:17:20] I am given the
[2:17:23] Revelation and with my
[2:17:26] Revelation I write unto
[2:17:29] you so that you could
[2:17:31] understand my
[2:17:33] knowledge in the mystery of
[2:17:37] Christ now God gave it to Paul and Paul
[2:17:43] gave it to the
[2:17:44] church that is
[2:17:46] why in the conduct order doctr
[2:17:54] uh we will have the
[2:17:58] sequence of
[2:18:02] positions whereby God does not take a
[2:18:05] shortcut and
[2:18:07] come he'll give it to the prophet for a
[2:18:11] purpose and the Prophet The Prophet will
[2:18:14] give it to the
[2:18:16] pastor and the pastor will give it to
[2:18:19] you but now when I say give it to
[2:18:22] you I'm talking about the
[2:18:25] revelation God will reveal it to the
[2:18:30] prophet let's go to the seven seal it
[2:18:33] says the revelation of the seven
[2:18:38] seal the revelation of
[2:18:40] the now the
[2:18:42] seventh
[2:18:44] seal is revealed to the
[2:18:49] prophet right amen
[2:18:51] and the prophet revealed the seventh
[2:18:58] SE and the
[2:19:00] pastor took the seven
[2:19:03] SE and
[2:19:08] clarified until it is revealed to
[2:19:13] us what does it do
[2:19:16] he he he just
[2:19:19] teaches and when it
[2:19:21] teaches there is a spirit that brings an
[2:19:26] understanding in
[2:19:28] you because this thing is a
[2:19:31] revelation it goes with that
[2:19:35] sequence it's revealed to brother
[2:19:37] BR it's revealed to the pastor it's
[2:19:41] revealed to the
[2:19:42] church are we together now
[2:19:46] individually you catch it by revelation
[2:19:50] now where is your where is your
[2:19:53] inheritance your the inheritance when it
[2:19:56] is revealed unto
[2:19:58] you because it takes you back to your
[2:20:03] position it ascends you to your position
[2:20:07] where you
[2:20:09] are that's where your Revelation
[2:20:13] is you hear what he
[2:20:15] says verse
[2:20:17] four when you read

[2:20:25] knowledge Paul says when you read you
[2:20:29] understand his
[2:20:31] knowledge in the mystery of
[2:20:36] Christ it's a mystery then Paul says
[2:20:40] when you read what I'm telling
[2:20:43] you what I've written to you then you
[2:20:49] understand right
[2:20:51] amen
[2:20:53] amen there was a
[2:20:56] part oh there is a part in the SCP in
[2:21:00] the book of
[2:21:02] Acts let's read
[2:21:05] it the book of Acts chapter 13 acts 13
[2:21:09] verse 47 verse
[2:21:11] 47 what I'm trying to bring forth
[2:21:16] Believers is that there's nothing
[2:21:21] uh
[2:21:23] heart and there's nothing that you
[2:21:25] cannot
[2:21:28] understand unless you you you do away
[2:21:31] with your understanding with with your
[2:21:34] mental
[2:21:39] understanding look I'm coming to that
[2:21:42] one what are we waiting
[2:21:46] here we are waiting for the changing of
[2:21:49] our body
[2:21:52] what what is the
[2:21:54] rapture the Rapture is when our body
[2:21:59] changes right now what is going to
[2:22:03] change your
[2:22:06] body and how is your body going to
[2:22:10] [Music]
[2:22:12] change right what does the Bible says it
[2:22:16] speaks about the the second Adam
[2:22:21] it says it's a quickening
[2:22:24] spirit says the second Adam is a
[2:22:27] quickening
[2:22:31] spirit that
[2:22:33] weight that is in
[2:22:36] you it
[2:22:40] germinates it
[2:22:42] forms another supernatural
[2:22:47] being the word of God is in your heart
[2:22:52] when is your
[2:22:53] heart it formed a supernatural
[2:22:58] being that supernatural being is called
[2:23:02] a
[2:23:03] theop it's your
[2:23:06] body it's your
[2:23:09] Supernatural and the prophet says that
[2:23:12] body is subject to the
[2:23:17] way it forms a man
[2:23:22] right it's a supernatural
[2:23:27] being right am
[2:23:30] now the quickening
[2:23:33] spirit it's when that body takes
[2:23:38] over it's like you were
[2:23:41] born you were born somewhere by your
[2:23:45] mother and
[2:23:48] father when you receive the word of
[2:23:52] God you you you get another
[2:23:55] nature which is
[2:23:58] divine now Paul speaks about the two
[2:24:02] Natures in a
[2:24:05] man
[2:24:07] fighting when you want to do this the
[2:24:10] other nature says do this until you
[2:24:14] surrender to the divine
[2:24:17] nature how does the divine nature come
[2:24:19] into you
[2:24:22] Romans chapter
[2:24:24] 16 16 it says your
[2:24:29] spirit and the spirit of
[2:24:32] God come to a
[2:24:34] point where they
[2:24:37] agree now what is the agreement of the
[2:24:40] two
[2:24:43] Spirits uh it does not say now the
[2:24:46] spirit of God surrender to your spirit
[2:24:50] [Music]
[2:24:52] it
[2:24:54] changes your
[2:24:56] spirit and then once it changes your
[2:25:00] spirit and then you start feeding from
[2:25:05] [Music]
[2:25:06] God and when you start feeding
[2:25:09] from we say you grow
[2:25:14] spiritually then it forms another
[2:25:18] body that is why he
[2:25:21] said take he says take this this bre
[2:25:27] it's my flesh that's why he said I am
[2:25:31] the
[2:25:33] bridge that comes from
[2:25:35] Heaven says eat this it's my body flesh
[2:25:41] is the weight you eat the word of God
[2:25:46] are we together that's why we are here
[2:25:49] because there's something that
[2:25:52] us there's something that when we come
[2:25:54] to the
[2:25:56] service we eat the
[2:25:59] way but
[2:26:00] now it's not a matter of feeding
[2:26:04] you but the
[2:26:08] interpretation of what has been
[2:26:10] said it comes
[2:26:13] from the spirit itself I don't want to
[2:26:16] read that scripture I read it in I'll
[2:26:18] quote it first it's it's it's it's
[2:26:21] Ephesians 1:1 17 it says God will give
[2:26:26] you a
[2:26:28] spirit right am and then that
[2:26:33] spirit will bring will give you
[2:26:37] knowledge and
[2:26:41] understanding in other words you cannot
[2:26:45] understand the word of God all by
[2:26:49] yourself
[2:26:52] there's a certain spirit that have to
[2:26:55] interpret what you have
[2:26:58] read like now people they say this thing
[2:27:03] is too
[2:27:05] difficult but there is a
[2:27:07] spirit that needs to explain to you
[2:27:12] what and then by explaining to you then
[2:27:16] that is the
[2:27:18] growth of what we call the inner
[2:27:22] until you reach the St of a perfect
[2:27:26] [Applause]
[2:27:28] man and then when you reach the St of a
[2:27:30] perfect man then you see your
[2:27:36] inheritance you know
[2:27:38] Caleb was
[2:27:40] shown as a place say Moses said that is
[2:27:45] your
[2:27:46] place in the Promised Land
[2:27:50] he kept that within
[2:27:52] himself he never left that
[2:27:55] thing when he crossed over knew where
[2:27:59] his place
[2:28:01] are when you cross over when you cross
[2:28:05] over you should know where you
[2:28:08] place when they said the word is now in
[2:28:11] the
[2:28:13] bright place
[2:28:14] you that is placing you let you know
[2:28:18] where your place is
[2:28:21] you are not going to scratch your
[2:28:23] head you already have the
[2:28:28] Revelation the seventh seed is the one
[2:28:31] that pleases
[2:28:32] you the power of the
[2:28:34] third is the one that makes you to
[2:28:41] overcome are we
[2:28:43] together all right let's continue uh I
[2:28:46] ask scripture or sorry
[2:28:51] before you could read that let's connect
[2:28:54] it Paul says as I write a four I'm
[2:28:58] reading I'm going back to verse
[2:29:01] three as I wrote a four in few
[2:29:05] words whereby when you
[2:29:08] read you may you may understand my
[2:29:12] knowledge in the Myster of
[2:29:15] Christ right amen Now read now that uh
[2:29:20] scripture in the book of Acts
[2:29:25] 13:47 for so have the Lord commanded us
[2:29:29] saying I have set thee to be a light of
[2:29:32] the Gentiles that thou should us be for
[2:29:35] salvation unto the end of the
[2:29:38] Earth yeah now you you should go and
[2:29:42] read the whole Acts chapter chapter 13
[2:29:45] the old it's when now
[2:29:48] Paul was changing his
[2:29:53] ministry
[2:29:55] so the Min like like brother
[2:29:58] Brenham when the ministry
[2:30:01] changes becomes the ministry of an
[2:30:04] Angel remember he went
[2:30:07] westwards he met the seventh
[2:30:09] angel he met the notable
[2:30:12] one then after he met
[2:30:15] the the ministry changed it was a new
[2:30:19] Commission
[2:30:21] now it's the
[2:30:22] ministry of the
[2:30:25] angel now that
[2:30:27] angel
[2:30:29] communicate with your
[2:30:32] angel are we together because after he
[2:30:36] met that
[2:30:39] angel
[2:30:41] then there was no uh spoon
[2:30:45] [Music]
[2:30:47] feeding he was not spoon feeding
[2:30:52] he
[2:30:53] came look he
[2:30:57] preached from the first
[2:31:00] seal up to the Sixth
[2:31:03] Seal when it comes to the seven
[2:31:10] SE when it comes to the
[2:31:17] seven are we together
[2:31:20] now
[2:31:22] Paul was a a
[2:31:25] [Music]
[2:31:26] Jew okay let me leave that one our Lord
[2:31:30] Jesus
[2:31:31] Christ went to the first
[2:31:35] pool second
[2:31:37] pool the third pool and after the
[2:31:42] revelation after he
[2:31:45] said after Peter said thou are the
[2:31:49] Christ
[2:31:51] the son of the Living
[2:31:53] God then he said tell no
[2:32:00] one
[2:32:02] why you know he took them to M
[2:32:07] Transfiguration and they saw him being
[2:32:11] transfigured and then he said tell no
[2:32:15] one there was a blind
[2:32:18] man he took him out of the
[2:32:21] city and prayed for him and he received
[2:32:25] his side then he said
[2:32:28] tell why is
[2:32:32] tell instead of running to the seat and
[2:32:35] say I can see
[2:32:37] now says tell
[2:32:41] no he was because these are Supernatural
[2:32:47] thing if you if you right now if one of
[2:32:51] you can go to heaven and and meet God
[2:32:57] and SP speak with God and come back and
[2:33:01] say I I visited
[2:33:03] God we're going to take him
[2:33:09] to like like I was reading here that
[2:33:12] brother was communic with
[2:33:15] God God was rebuking me don't do this
[2:33:18] don't do this what did the Pentecostal
[2:33:21] say now he's sick
[2:33:25] this actually after his
[2:33:28] death God killed
[2:33:30] him he was
[2:33:34] angry now our Lord Jesus
[2:33:37] Christ uh he did all those good
[2:33:41] things now when he says
[2:33:45] I and my father are one
[2:33:50] the problem started
[2:33:52] there now what is that it is because now
[2:33:57] changing
[2:34:01] Dimensions it it must God
[2:34:05] himself it must be
[2:34:08] God that reveals himself to
[2:34:13] them that's why he says tell no
[2:34:16] one he said Peter flesh and blood did
[2:34:21] not reveal that
[2:34:23] you now wait let the other people
[2:34:27] also get the
[2:34:30] Revelation now when they
[2:34:33] saw him on trans
[2:34:37] transfig they themselves were
[2:34:41] convinced that this man he not an
[2:34:44] ordinary man now wait until
[2:34:49] it is revealed to those
[2:34:51] people at the right time they themselves
[2:34:56] would say it like the Samaritan
[2:34:59] woman
[2:35:01] saw and then after I saw him the other
[2:35:04] people came and see and see him for
[2:35:10] themselves and then what did they say
[2:35:12] that's yes we've heard what but now we
[2:35:15] are seeing it for
[2:35:18] ourselves now each and
[2:35:21] everyone it must be
[2:35:24] [Applause]
[2:35:27] revealed it's
[2:35:29] not a a teaching or a
[2:35:33] preaching it has to be
[2:35:37] revealed brother Bram
[2:35:39] says I lay
[2:35:41] out I lay out I
[2:35:45] preach and preach and saw you
[2:35:50] must take what I've
[2:35:54] preached go and
[2:35:56] pray go and go and
[2:35:59] pray and then God will reveal it when
[2:36:03] when when you read the the seventh se
[2:36:06] you can read from the first up to the
[2:36:11] sixth when you reach the
[2:36:14] seven you will feel that
[2:36:16] now then you will say
[2:36:20] this is my
[2:36:22] Revelation then you will sit back and
[2:36:24] say yeah now I want to see his
[2:36:28] R then you'll end up saying it's
[2:36:33] mine it ends up there it say it's my
[2:36:37] Revelation are together that is why now
[2:36:41] some other people say it's not revealed
[2:36:45] and then what is it
[2:36:49] because he says it's my
[2:36:51] Revelation and then when okay let's
[2:36:57] continue right we were reading uh about
[2:37:02] Paul uh crossing
[2:37:05] over to the
[2:37:09] uh
[2:37:11] Gentiles we spoke about our Lord Jesus
[2:37:15] Christ after uh Peter
[2:37:20] had a
[2:37:24] revelation he became the
[2:37:29] target you
[2:37:32] see
[2:37:33] until he said to our
[2:37:37] Lord because he said after that the
[2:37:41] ministry changed after Peter said thou
[2:37:44] are the Christ the son of the Living God
[2:37:47] the ministry changed
[2:37:50] amen and then when the ministry
[2:37:54] Chang it becomes something
[2:37:59] unable something that you cannot
[2:38:03] understand he
[2:38:07] says I'm going to be
[2:38:10] arrested I'll be uh
[2:38:14] crucified and I will rise on the third
[2:38:17] page now they start that's crashing
[2:38:20] their crashing their now Peter
[2:38:24] said you
[2:38:27] arrested Over My Dead
[2:38:29] Bo and then he called him
[2:38:32] aside and said that will never
[2:38:35] happen now I said Peter after the
[2:38:39] Revelation he became the
[2:38:43] target then what did God say I mean what
[2:38:46] did Christ say he said get the behind me
[2:38:50] you
[2:38:51] Satan devil now you were saying that
[2:38:57] to because he saw the devil in
[2:39:02] Peter he was casting out the
[2:39:05] devil you remember he said to Peter
[2:39:09] Peter the devil want to sift
[2:39:14] you like the bride the devil want to
[2:39:18] sift the bride
[2:39:21] but what did he say to
[2:39:23] Peter I have prayed for
[2:39:27] you you
[2:39:28] see now a predestinated
[2:39:34] person you cannot change his
[2:39:38] journey if the prophet
[2:39:41] says the word is in the
[2:39:44] bright there's no way in which you can
[2:39:46] divert
[2:39:50] look you can say what you want
[2:39:54] to
[2:39:56] no there was a
[2:39:58] time where where Christ
[2:40:02] said uh if you don't eat my
[2:40:05] flesh and drink my blood are not
[2:40:09] worthy the others turn their
[2:40:12] back and Peter
[2:40:15] remain then he said no what about you
[2:40:18] people
[2:40:21] then Peter said where shall we
[2:40:25] go
[2:40:28] why
[2:40:33] because etal life are with you now if
[2:40:37] you read John don't read it I'm quote it
[2:40:40] John 663 joh 663 it
[2:40:44] says flesh profited nothing
[2:40:49] the
[2:40:50] spirit that
[2:40:53] profited now it's the words that I
[2:40:57] speak they are life and they
[2:41:01] Spirit the words that he
[2:41:04] speaks they are a life oh it is the
[2:41:09] spirit that Quicken
[2:41:12] it the flesh profited
[2:41:15] nothing the words that I speak un to you
[2:41:20] they are spirit and they are
[2:41:23] [Applause]
[2:41:26] life those are the words that builds
[2:41:30] life unto
[2:41:31] you those are the words that bring life
[2:41:35] unto
[2:41:36] you so what I want to show you that
[2:41:40] towards the end there's lot of
[2:41:44] commission because the I mean the lot of
[2:41:47] commotion
[2:41:50] because there comes a
[2:41:52] new commission which is not
[2:41:56] [Music]
[2:41:58] written so you going to search it with a
[2:42:01] scripture you won't find it it's to
[2:42:06] you because God gave it to
[2:42:11] Adam and the devil nearly took
[2:42:14] it that is why there was silence in
[2:42:17] heaven
[2:42:19] it must be something that will go
[2:42:21] directly to
[2:42:23] you because I gave you the first pool
[2:42:27] the second po the devil took
[2:42:30] it and diverted
[2:42:34] it that is
[2:42:37] why that is why there's so lot of
[2:42:41] healing
[2:42:45] sessions are we together let's continue
[2:42:50] amen amen now we were in verse
[2:42:55] four let's go to verse
[2:42:59] 5 he says let's let's connect it
[2:43:03] first whereby when you read you may
[2:43:06] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[2:43:08] of
[2:43:13] Christ which in other Ages was not made
[2:43:17] known Unto the Sons of
[2:43:24] men as it now
[2:43:29] revealed into His Holy
[2:43:34] Apostles and Prophets by the
[2:43:39] spirit
[2:43:41] revealed
[2:43:43] unto the Holy
[2:43:46] Apostles Prophets
[2:43:49] by the spirit verse eight verse unto
[2:43:54] me who am less than the
[2:43:57] least of All
[2:44:00] Saints this Grace given I mean the I
[2:44:03] mean is this Grace
[2:44:06] given that I should
[2:44:09] preach among the
[2:44:11] Gentiles they un searchable
[2:44:17] riches when min
[2:44:20] changed become the unable
[2:44:23] riches then he continues and says and to
[2:44:26] make all
[2:44:30] men
[2:44:31] see what is the Fellowship of the
[2:44:37] mystery by the way we said what was the
[2:44:41] mystery something that is difficult or
[2:44:45] impossible to understand to explain but
[2:44:51] Paul
[2:44:54] says ver what you call uh uh verse n and
[2:45:00] to make all men
[2:45:03] see what is the
[2:45:06] Fellowship of the mystery fellowshipping
[2:45:09] in the
[2:45:11] mystery that is the
[2:45:14] seven it's it's it's a hidden
[2:45:20] that the bride
[2:45:23] fellow the bride
[2:45:26] Fellowship on the
[2:45:31] hidden on something that people say is
[2:45:35] difficult or impossible to understand or
[2:45:40] to explain we don't have to understand
[2:45:43] it it needs to be
[2:45:47] revealed so the
[2:45:51] Fellowship on those things he says which
[2:45:54] from the beginning of the
[2:45:58] world it had been hid in
[2:46:01] God something that was hidden in God
[2:46:06] himself that's what you fellowshipping
[2:46:10] about it was only God that knows
[2:46:15] that and when he went to fellowship with
[2:46:17] you he makes you a
[2:46:22] god are we together so that now we
[2:46:25] should could
[2:46:28] fellowship with the fellow
[2:46:32] God it's in the same
[2:46:34] [Music]
[2:46:37] stream have you heard what it says it
[2:46:41] says and to make men
[2:46:45] see what is the Fellowship of the
[2:46:47] mystery
[2:46:50] which from the beginning of the
[2:46:53] world been hid in
[2:46:56] God who created All
[2:47:01] Things by who by Jesus Christ God

[2:47:36] you so that when I close I must not miss
[2:47:42] it the the prophet speaks

[2:49:28] ordained to come to the Earth to Bear
[2:49:34] record and they work through mortal
[2:49:41] beings just as they did to
[2:49:45] Daniel back through the ages
[2:49:50] and I believe it with all my
[2:49:53] heart that Angelic
[2:49:56] beings Ministers of
[2:50:00] God then paragraph 13
[2:50:03] says and so
[2:50:07] therefore and so therefore
[2:50:10] friends as your
[2:50:12] brother that all I
[2:50:14] [Music]
[2:50:16] am but God's gift
[2:50:19] is the spirit of
[2:50:21] God that came down in the form of an
[2:50:27] Angel God's
[2:50:29] gift came down in the form
[2:50:35] of now he didn't have
[2:50:39] wings he looked like a
[2:50:42] man I heard him when he
[2:50:45] walk just as that walk on the floor
[2:50:51] walk right
[2:50:53] over just as normal as any
[2:50:56] man and talk just like any
[2:50:59] man he comes time after time through the
[2:51:05] room and different places when I'm
[2:51:08] fasting and
[2:51:11] praying right amen let's
[2:51:14] continue reading Revelation 1 ver one
[2:51:19] verse
[2:51:23] one Revelation 1 verse
[2:51:28] one the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[2:51:31] God gave unto him to show unto his
[2:51:34] servants things which must shortly come
[2:51:37] to pass yes and he sent and signified it
[2:51:41] by his Angel unto his servant
[2:51:44] John now it says Jesus Christ
[2:51:49] the revelation of Jesus
[2:51:53] Christ remember we say Christ was
[2:51:55] processed from
[2:52:01] God it's
[2:52:03] God it's God himself when he takes
[2:52:06] another
[2:52:08] platform and is
[2:52:10] Christ so the revelation of
[2:52:14] Christ which God gave unto him
[2:52:19] to show unto his
[2:52:21] servants things which must shortly come
[2:52:24] to
[2:52:28] pass now he
[2:52:30] send an
[2:52:34] angel he sent an angel to
[2:52:38] signify to
[2:52:42] John amen now John in order to be aware
[2:52:50] that that this comes from
[2:52:52] God there must be an
[2:52:55] angel that is
[2:52:57] send that's why the Bible says
[2:53:01] here he
[2:53:03] sends right amen and
[2:53:07] signify by his
[2:53:10] Angel unto his
[2:53:14] s right verse two verse two who bear
[2:53:19] record of the word of
[2:53:24] God now they said to our Lord Jesus
[2:53:29] Christ you bear record of
[2:53:34] yourself now in
[2:53:36] Israel whenever you come with your
[2:53:40] story they want to
[2:53:42] hear they want to see an
[2:53:44] angel bearing a record
[2:53:50] there should be a
[2:53:51] sign that you come
[2:53:56] from when when our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:53:59] says I come from God and I go back to
[2:54:04] God they say now bear a
[2:54:09] record you see now when
[2:54:15] God uh in the Book of Revelation
[2:54:20] John saw these
[2:54:23] things the Book of
[2:54:26] Revelation and then there was an
[2:54:29] angel that came and bear
[2:54:36] record it's like when uh you you speak
[2:54:41] about the seven seal or the thir pool
[2:54:48] an
[2:54:49] angel that bear
[2:54:52] record when you speak about third
[2:54:55] pool angel must bear
[2:54:59] record let me give you an
[2:55:01] [Music]
[2:55:03] example
[2:55:05] uh the manifestations of the sons of
[2:55:09] God what do they
[2:55:14] manifest they manifest the things
[2:55:19] that that were taken out of a man man
[2:55:22] was a king here on
[2:55:27] Earth are we together then men I mean
[2:55:31] men should be retained or
[2:55:34] restored back to his
[2:55:37] position and manifest what he used to
[2:55:42] manifest in the Garden of
[2:55:45] Eden uh Adam Adam
[2:55:48] was manifesting
[2:55:51] things was calling things
[2:55:56] into now it's brother says the third
[2:56:00] pool is to the lost
[2:56:03] [Music]
[2:56:05] soul that is why our Lord Jesus
[2:56:10] Christ had the first
[2:56:12] one making
[2:56:14] Miracles the second one rebuking the
[2:56:17] Pharisees and
[2:56:21] Jesus the third one he went to
[2:56:25] hell to preach to the
[2:56:28] souls and the third PO is to do the same
[2:56:33] [Music]
[2:56:34] thing now how do we preach to the souls
[2:56:38] that repented
[2:56:41] not now listen carefully how do we the
[2:56:46] bride preach to the Souls that
[2:56:51] repent that is why there's this issue of
[2:56:54] the
[2:56:57] underworld what what is in the in the
[2:57:00] Underworld the souls that repented
[2:57:05] not look he said I will build my
[2:57:09] church The Gates of
[2:57:12] Hell shall not Prevail
[2:57:14] against which means there's a gate from
[2:57:18] hell they Prevail I mean they
[2:57:22] ascend to the
[2:57:25] Earth together through those
[2:57:29] Gates what are those
[2:57:31] Gates those Gates they come through the
[2:57:36] rituals that they
[2:57:39] [Music]
[2:57:41] do when they make rituals they open up
[2:57:44] the gate they call the souls
[2:57:48] that never rep
[2:57:51] repented and they are in contact with
[2:57:54] those
[2:57:56] Souls now it's only the fat pool that
[2:58:00] can close
[2:58:04] that are we
[2:58:07] together you go out right now to any
[2:58:12] River you will find them making
[2:58:17] rituals rituals they make rituals what
[2:58:20] is the ritual the ritual will
[2:58:24] communicate with the
[2:58:26] Unseen with a
[2:58:29] spirit that is in
[2:58:31] hell and come in a certain
[2:58:34] form are are we together and communicate
[2:58:38] and
[2:58:39] come are we together and from there on
[2:58:43] they mobilize to fight people
[2:58:48] they come to the people and incarnate
[2:58:51] themselves into people are we together
[2:58:55] they come from hand and then you the
[2:58:58] bride you are the only
[2:59:00] one that could close
[2:59:05] that and and and what does the prophet
[2:59:09] say the prophet says there are those
[2:59:13] people that God hears when they pray
[2:59:18] what God hears
[2:59:21] them when they pray God hears
[2:59:25] them what makes them what makes God to
[2:59:28] hear
[2:59:31] them because they are in line with the
[2:59:35] word of
[2:59:35] [Applause]
[2:59:38] God are we
[2:59:41] together they are
[2:59:44] relevant with the word of
[2:59:46] God look
[2:59:48] if God
[2:59:49] says go
[2:59:53] south and you go
[2:59:55] north then God cannot follow
[2:59:59] you he follows the one that goes to
[3:00:03] the because he is relevant
[3:00:07] with he do what God says he should do at
[3:00:11] the right
[3:00:13] time are we together now God hears you
[3:00:19] because you are relevant with his
[3:00:22] words you do what he says you should
[3:00:27] do
[3:00:29] look our Lord Jesus Christ said to his
[3:00:33] disciples let's go and
[3:00:36] meet in Galilee they didn't go to galile
[3:00:40] he was not happy about he could not
[3:00:43] expose
[3:00:44] himself because he said they must go to
[3:00:46] G
[3:00:48] From Galilee is's going to give them a
[3:00:51] commission are we together but he will
[3:00:54] he he will prove
[3:00:56] himself there will be uh they were
[3:01:01] hiding he just came in and said peace be
[3:01:03] with you without any door
[3:01:06] opening you see and he say Thomas look
[3:01:10] look here come come because you don't
[3:01:13] believe he was proving
[3:01:15] himself but thaty want to do that that
[3:01:18] side and then from there he gave them a
[3:01:22] commission go and
[3:01:26] wait and the Holy Spirit will come and
[3:01:30] therea he start by saying in John 6 he
[3:01:34] says there's lot of things that I can
[3:01:38] tell you you will never understand he
[3:01:40] was with them but when he comes he will
[3:01:45] tell you all things
[3:01:49] now if you don't go and wait you won't
[3:01:53] know all
[3:01:54] things and if you don't
[3:01:58] follow the ministry of the time that you
[3:02:02] are living
[3:02:05] in after
[3:02:09] together so now there's a
[3:02:12] Ministry that is
[3:02:15] powerful but it's hidden from the wise
[3:02:19] and
[3:02:20] prudent and is revealed unto you the
[3:02:23] [Applause]
[3:02:25] babies all right I'm closing let me

[3:05:56] faithful and true and the Lord God of
[3:05:59] the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show
[3:06:02] unto his servants the things which must
[3:06:04] shortly be done verse seven behold I

[3:06:24] of the Angel which showed me these
[3:06:28] things

[3:06:42] prophets and of them which keep the
[3:06:45] sayings of this book God
[3:06:49] Amen now in
[3:06:52] closing uh we started by
[3:06:56] reading
[3:06:57] about uh the Angelic
[3:07:00] [Music]
[3:07:01] beings and and the process in
[3:07:06] which they they they
[3:07:09] descend the Bible
[3:07:12] says unto the
[3:07:16] angel of the church Church of
[3:07:19] Ephesus to the angel to the angel until
[3:07:24] it comes to the aition and says unto the
[3:07:27] angel of the Church of laisha so you see
[3:07:30] brother was an
[3:07:33] angel and then and then then when
[3:07:37] brother Brenham was an
[3:07:39] angel there was a time
[3:07:41] now that he went
[3:07:44] Westward and met an angel
[3:07:48] which is the notable
[3:07:51] one then that changed the
[3:07:53] ministry and then when that changed the
[3:07:56] ministry was the one now that came and
[3:08:00] explained
[3:08:02] everything in the Book of
[3:08:06] Revelation there is no
[3:08:08] Prophet that could explain the Book
[3:08:13] of from Revelation chapter one
[3:08:17] up to re the last chapter
[3:08:20] 22 he was bearing
[3:08:24] record of of all
[3:08:26] things that is the man that was
[3:08:29] explaining to
[3:08:31] John and John wanted to
[3:08:34] write said no don't
[3:08:37] write but in the days of the voice of
[3:08:42] the seventh
[3:08:44] angel when he shall begin to write the
[3:08:48] mystery the
[3:08:50] mystery so that
[3:08:52] angel is your
[3:08:54] angel is your
[3:08:56] brother that's why he start by
[3:09:00] explaining the different
[3:09:03] Angels but you will never say that angel
[3:09:06] was me but you go and read between the
[3:09:09] line who explained to join all these
