[51:04] and while we are driving somebody will
[51:06] come
[51:07] and just drive that car while we are
[51:09] sleeping
[51:11] for so many kilometers without knowing

[51:17] that the car is still on the way
[51:19] that is the court of the seven sea
[51:22] that is the record of the deadpool
[51:26] those who are traveling further
[51:29] who are using the planes who are using
[51:31] the cars
[51:33] as long as further they are deprived we
[51:36] know that they are safe with you
[51:38] because no one father can touch your
[51:40] pride
[51:42] we've got those who are sick father the
[51:45] brethren who are sick
[51:47] today lord you know them

[56:26] next week's sunday
[56:30] this coming sunday
[56:32] am i right this coming sunday
[56:35] the elder says
[56:37] it is correct
[56:39] so this coming sunday
[56:41] we are streaming from
[56:48] amen
[56:50] so the tabernacle will be closed
[56:54] we are streaming from
[56:56] lufonte
[56:59] i believe
[57:00] you'll notice some changes outside
[57:03] we have some water tanks
[57:06] can we clap hands for them
[57:12] if everything goes well we won't have
[57:15] water problems
[57:19] amen
[57:21] you know it is so good to fellowship at
[57:23] the place
[57:25] where we have the cons
[57:27] we have the pastor and we have the
[57:29] elders
[57:30] they look after us isn't it
[57:34] [Applause]
[57:42] you know
[57:43] we have this controversial picture
[57:50] it was taken i believe in
[57:54] in congo
[57:57] after the pastor preached
[57:59] while he was seated
[58:02] a sister took that picture
[58:04] and
[58:05] it appears
[58:07] there was some supernatural light around
[58:09] the picture
[58:11] you have that picture isn't it
[58:14] now
[58:15] the pasta
[58:17] has brought it to our attention that
[58:20] we have the correct picture and we have
[58:22] the wrong picture
[58:27] so
[58:27] [Music]
[58:30] there is a wrong one that we distributed
[58:34] some years ago i believe
[58:36] that there is a correct one
[58:40] so the pastor has corrected us
[58:43] and
[58:44] the elders have that correct picture
[58:46] they also have it on their profile
[58:48] pictures even the library is printing
[58:51] that correct picture
[58:53] so if you have the wrong one
[58:57] you have to destroy it
[59:00] and use the correct one
[59:03] god bless you
[59:05] you can check it on the elder's profiles
[59:08] there is a correct one i know that some
[59:10] of you will love that picture
[59:12] god bless you
[59:13] amen
[59:18] may the lord richly bless you
[59:20] amen
[59:21] as we stand on our feet
[59:24] to welcome our precious pastor to the
[59:26] pulpit
[59:30] and
[59:31] sistan godima brought a very wonderful
[59:34] testimony
[59:36] to thank the lord
[59:38] she celebrated her birthday during the
[59:40] course of the week
[59:43] and she just want to thank the lord
[59:46] for all the blessings that she received
[59:49] throughout the years
[59:52] and also want to thank the pastor
[59:55] for him for his prayers
[1:00:03] [Applause]
[1:00:12] i heard his father's day today
[1:00:16] so
[1:00:17] all the fathers
[1:00:19] must also thank the lord
[1:00:22] can we clap hands
[1:00:24] [Music]
[1:00:25] [Applause]

[1:02:48] tape away

[1:47:06] while we are struggling to say to the
[1:47:08] people repent do this do right don't do
[1:47:10] that don't do that there are some people

[1:47:19] [Music]
[1:48:16] worshipers

[1:48:46] there's someone who is beyond that who
[1:48:49] knows
[1:48:52] all right
[1:48:55] then it says
[1:48:58] he began to bring upon the earth
[1:49:08] something in his own image

[1:49:33] there is one still worshipping who know
[1:49:37] jesus are called
[1:49:38] church ages
[1:49:45] he can't be in the same league with the
[1:49:48] one who is beyond that
[1:49:53] lawyer
[1:50:35] don't do that
[1:51:03] even today
[1:51:31] a worshiper um
[1:51:40] there's a time when god was with the
[1:51:42] people
[1:51:43] who
[1:51:44] doesn't when he was not with the people
[1:51:46] who is
[1:51:54] even the children of israel when
[1:51:56] sometimes they would
[1:51:58] think
[1:51:59] that god is with them
[1:52:27] um
[1:52:56] i've done this i've
[1:53:10] when
[1:53:11] he arrives at something he's in his own
[1:53:14] lap
[1:53:19] that thing
[1:53:20] anything that is in the image of god a
[1:53:23] young kingdom

[1:55:00] of the lord was there at the gates
