And they brought young children to him that he should touch them. and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein." And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. We don't baptize children because we have not found it in the Bible. If somebody can come and show us here is the verse in the Bible but tell children then we shall do that. But because we don't have such scriptures, we have got this one that children must be dedicated &gt;&gt; dedicated. Then here is the child in front of me and the mother and the father.

So &gt;&gt; chapter 6 from verse 1 to3 I believe &gt;&gt; and then uh we are going to read also the book of Luke. Let's start by chapter 6 vers from verse 1 to three. Come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us. He hath smitten and he will bind us up. After two days will he res revive us. In the third day he will rise us up and we shall live in his sight. Then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the earth. &gt;&gt; Let's read the book of Luke chapter 21. Um we're going to read verse um five and six &gt;&gt; and we're going to read also 9 to2 Luke chapter 21 from verse 5 and 6. And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said, "As for these things which he behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, &gt;&gt; that shall not be thrown down." Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse N. &gt;&gt; But when you shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified, &gt;&gt; for these things must first come to pass, &gt;&gt; but the end is not by and by. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Then said he unto them, nation shall rise against nation, &gt;&gt; and kingdoms against kingdoms. &gt;&gt; to to &gt;&gt; verse 11. And great earthquakes shall be in diverse places, &gt;&gt; and fairmines and pestilence, &gt;&gt; and fearful sides, and great signs shall there be from heaven. &gt;&gt; But before all this, they shall lay their hands on you, &gt;&gt; and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues &gt;&gt; and into prison, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake. Close our eyes. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; standing here in front of your children, &gt;&gt; not worthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you are the worthy one. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm asking as we have read the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Use my voice and my brother's voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let us deliver your message &gt;&gt; to your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We pray and asking in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may take your seats. I'm going to just have this as a topic. &gt;&gt; Where are we? &gt;&gt; The bride and the subtopic. It pays to take warnings. &gt;&gt; Take warnings. Um we are living at the end time. In other words, we are living beyond beyond time because we know seven church ages is time. Then John was privileged to see those seven churches and all things which happened there. John saw those things. Are you hearing? &gt;&gt; I say John saw them. &gt;&gt; Why don't you wonder? Because John's eyes was not there. &gt;&gt; They've taken out his eyes. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says he saw what happened in different ages. He he wrote those things. He was told by the angel until he finished all those seven churches at the end there chapter 4 he says after these things the door was opened He said, "I heard the voice from that door in heaven. &gt;&gt; The voice which I have heard." In other words, if you have not heard, you'll never hear. That's what the Bible says. Those who hear my words and believe on him who sent me, &gt;&gt; they have got eternal life. How? Why do they hear is because they have got eternal life. They hear because they have got eternal life. are feeling. &gt;&gt; They hear because they have had John says &gt;&gt; those who have been taught &gt;&gt; and heard from their father come to me. &gt;&gt; In other words, they were there now they are here. &gt;&gt; John said the the voice which I have heard never I hear in heaven but he said after these things what is these things that is seven church ages I I will come back my pastor and I we are looking &gt;&gt; of things which are happening because time is normal. The Bible says people in Noah's time they were eating building taking care of nothing &gt;&gt; and this is what is happening in our day. People they don't take care of what is happening. I used to go to my pastor and he used to give me some things. which are taking place in our days. Noah Noah while he was building the ark. He was not ignorant. He was always looking at Enoch. The Bible says when he saw that Eno was no more he he went into the ark. He knows that something is going to happen. Why Eno is not here. Then we must always look at things. I will come back to that. But let me read something here in this book. They say it is the oncoming storm. &gt;&gt; He's talking about someone who was careless, [Music] who didn't take warnings. The man of God says here, I was reading, I forget just now, I believe it was in the newspaper of a storm a few years ago that was on his way across Florida. All the regions around was warned I just left there about five weeks ago [Music] and there was a neighbor man who kept in contact with the radio all the time [Music] because of these storms. He was a very renowned Christian. He heard that the great typhoon was coming. pisting down trees. Everyone was want to get to the safety. He thought of his neighbor who had a chicken farm and some light buildings with their chickens in them. And there and so forth where all that they had life was tight upon. in what their life was tied upon those chickens for their living. And he rushed quickly, frantically up to that gate and stopped his car and jumped out and said to this fellow, "Take all the chickens, put them in your storm shelter, and you rush over to my house because there is coming a typhoon or a storm that is going to twist everything down. And the man stood and looked at him and laughed at him and said, "Nonsense. I have heard them predict such things before and it never did happen." And the Christian neighbor was so excited. But what if it does happen? We hear remarks like that along the line. I've heard of this thing going going on that is going to happen. But it is going I tell you it is going to happen one of these days. But this man I have no time for such foolishness. I raise chickens. I have no time for such things. The neighbor said in the name of God, he said, "Leave those chickens alone. John, come quickly. You and your family. If you don't want to believe, let your family come. you don't want to come. He said if you don't want to come, just let your family come. Amen. While the storm swept through the country, it caught the chicken's house and they were found his body and they never found his body and his wife frantically fighting because the water swept and because she got her children and got them on top of the building holding on top of the chimney. There came the snake because the snake also was looking for shelter. It found them there on top and start biting them and killing the children and killing that wife. You must not forget the boot of that man was not found. Why? Because he he didn't listen to them. &gt;&gt; It pays to take warnings. In the days of Jesus &gt;&gt; where we have read, &gt;&gt; they were talking with Jesus, telling him how the temple was so beautiful. He said to them, "As for these things which you behold, the days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another shall not be thrown." He was prophesying about the destruction of the temple. and the city. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, &gt;&gt; "Those who have listened to his warning, they were not caught in that place." Because when that time comes, they were already gone. Let me read something here for you. It it pays it pays &gt;&gt; to take. &gt;&gt; Now this Christians that had the warning of Christ was a type of the thing we are talking about this morning. This Christian that had the warning, they got out of Jerusalem &gt;&gt; because he said when you see the armies encamp around you, you must get out because the time of it destruction, it has come. He said now here now wash the church. He said this Christ that had that warning, they got out of Jerusalem for they knew it was fixing to happen. Now watch the church members of the people who went to church just join the church. Why? There is armies coming there. for coming. Now let us go into the house of the Lord and pray but they are too late. You know he's talking about the prison of those days. when they see those armies. Jesus said when you see the armies you must but when they see the armies they say let's go and pray but they are too late. It didn't do a bit of good. They was watching the warning. Those disciples they were they was watching the warning what Jesus said and they escaped. In other words, it it helps to take owning. Jesus also prophesied about the signs that will precede the end time and and his second coming. He warned his disciple about the various natural disasters and the catastrophe events that will occur before the end time. In this verse where we have read 9 to 10, he spoke about wars and rumors of war and nation rising against nation, kingdom against kingdom. And in verse 11, he specifically mentioned earthquakes and fermines. Amen. We are living in those days. We have we hear rumors of wars. We hear about wars and we hear about disasters, natural disasters and we hear earthquakes, famines, pestilence, fearful signs, signs from heaven. Those are additional signs, the signs of the end time. The prophet says, &gt;&gt; there is a picture. I want you to push the picture here. I don't have a pointer here. But if you see the first three and a half years, Jesus was prophesying there &gt;&gt; when he said &gt;&gt; the stone shall not be left upon one's. &gt;&gt; He was prophecying about the destruction of the city and the temple &gt;&gt; and those things happen. and also our prophet here. He said, he had something about those things. Jesus was telling his disciples. Jesus was telling his disciples that they must take her. They must take care because they will hear rumors of. Our messenger here, he told us about those things also is telling us that these things will happen. Think of that. But the day that we are living in just before the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, there will be signs in the skies and in the earth. That is our prophet. Great sight, &gt;&gt; flying saucers, flying saucers, &gt;&gt; missiles, perplex of time, distress between nations, fearful size upon the earth and we are living in that day. In other words, this the day we are living in these things are happening. And we are seeing those things. He is warning us. &gt;&gt; They they serve as a vigilance and they are say they're giving us they are saying to us we must be faithful they are warning signs. In verse 28 there, &gt;&gt; verse 28, &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "When these things began to pass, then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption is thread." Brother Brenham also prophesied about many things and some of them happen. Many of them some of them are still the process of we mustn't just read. We must look at those things which ones have happened which ones have not happened. We must check our time. What is that video? &gt;&gt; I want you to put a video there. [Music] &gt;&gt; Do you see that video there? &gt;&gt; I don't know whether you see the video correctly. &gt;&gt; Do you see that woman there? What color of a jacket is he wearing? &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; He's wearing a purple dress. Our &gt;&gt; prophet prophesied about that. He said &gt;&gt; I won't have time in this meeting to tell you in 1933 this is a woman's nation is the number 13. He's talking about America. &gt;&gt; It appears in the 13th chapter of Revelation. 13 stars. 13 stripes. Everything is 13. Everything is a woman. Remember, thus saith the Lord. There will be a woman. [Music] Remember, thus saith the Lord. There will be a woman rule before the end time. Are you listening? She will either be a president or a vice president. The woman we were looking at there, what was he? What was she vice president? &gt;&gt; She she will either be a president or a vice president or it will be a Catholic church as a woman. But we have sin. What is that? It was a woman, not a Catholic church, &gt;&gt; but a woman. &gt;&gt; Let me read something here. Do you see that our prophet prophesied? It was just exactly what he said. He said, "Thus said the Lord. When those things happen, &gt;&gt; what does the Bible says? &gt;&gt; Lift up your heads. &gt;&gt; But there is some people who don't care. Let me read here. &gt;&gt; This book is Daniel 7 weeks. Daniel 7 weeks &gt;&gt; paragraph 207. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 207. &gt;&gt; Now I predicted and sat. I saw a great woman stand up, beautiful looking, dressed in a real highly royal like people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Show the video. What is the prophet saying here? &gt;&gt; What is he wearing there? &gt;&gt; I don't say this woman is a sin. I don't say that. You say that is the the fulfillment of the prophets &gt;&gt; which was prophesied &gt;&gt; back there in 1933. It has just happened. What does it mean? Where are you? She was a great ruler in United States United States. It might be a Catholic church a woman but I don't know it to be the Catholic church. I can't say only thing I seen only thing I seen you see. Amen. He said he has seen I seen the woman that was allow &gt;&gt; in the end time. &gt;&gt; He said after that I see America in depress. after this. I see America in deep and he said he said to us what Russia then when when something is is said about Russia that's why yesterday I was asking the elder there who is that president who talking there he said no now they made him a minister I wanted to hear what He was saying because when something is spoken about America, &gt;&gt; I and my pastor, &gt;&gt; we take we take look at those things. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I have seen him, he would have given me more things which are happening here. Amen. We have talked about mysteries. Yes. But now we want to see what is happening. And if we see what is happening, we we lift up our heads because we know our redemption has has has come near. He said &gt;&gt; in 1954, &gt;&gt; he prophesied about a a pope who will come out of America. Is that in that time the church will be close together and it will be with it will be cemented with love in that base. When the pope is coming out of America, it was a prophecy. The enemy now say fulfill. &gt;&gt; Now we are looking at the church which will be cemented with love. And this man is going to be the man who will be behind that image. He will be the main driver. We know that the mechanics are already there of that image is there. The mechanics already complete. What is waiting is the driver which is the mechanics. What is going to do is going to cost a squeeze. [Applause] In other words, when we look these things, we see now this is the truth. Because it was a prophecy. Many things has happened prophesied and happened. He says, "Lift up your heads because your redemption is &gt;&gt; Let me read something here perhaps. It's easy &gt;&gt; now with patience. [Music] &gt;&gt; We have to wait for this &gt;&gt; for the for the prophecies that is promised. Every one of them must be fulfilled when in this age. All right. Which age are we living in? No. No. No. Not a church. &gt;&gt; All right. Let me go on. For it forells us, the author has before done this. We are living in something like a calendar. &gt;&gt; You look at the calendar to find out what day of you are living in. And you look at God's Bible to see what age We are living to see the age we're living in. You must look at the Bible. The Bible will tell you in which age are you living because you will see the signs. We have seen many flying saucers. We have seen many of them &gt;&gt; sometimes like all right let me find it he says we are not living in the method age the baptist age we are living in the bride age the age we are living We are living in the bride. All the prophecies must happen in this age which are pertaining to us must must happen in this age. &gt;&gt; The calling must finish here. Bring him back to God through the channel that he has promised to bring it back in. He promised to do it. He said those who call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. That is the Bible. Those who call upon the name of the Lord, they shall be saved. It's not a might truth. But he said, &gt;&gt; how can they call upon it if they don't know that name? How can he how can they call upon the name if they don't know it? And how can they know it? If there is no preacher. In other words, to know the name of the Lord, there must be a preacher. And he said, "How can he preach if he's not sent?" Jesus said, "As the father has sent, so I sent him. And if he sent them, he came himself." Because when his father sent him, His father came himself inside him and he said it's not me who is doing this thing is my father who is in me and if he sends us he must come and be in us. Amen. You must not forget &gt;&gt; he will never send a woman. &gt;&gt; He will never [Music] thus say the Bible. &gt;&gt; Let me go on here. We are where are we brothers and sisters? &gt;&gt; Prophecies &gt;&gt; are fulfilled. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let me check something. Israel. &gt;&gt; Israel is our calendar. If you want to know &gt;&gt; what time are you living in, &gt;&gt; you have got a calendar and that calendar is now my church here knows that all through the years I always told you If you want to know what day of the week it is, look at the calendar. But if you want to know the time, watch those Jews. That is the only time peace God loted not certain times for the Gentiles. There was no sitting space of time. But Israel &gt;&gt; has time because God has given them seven days from week number one until the seventh. is the consumation. &gt;&gt; If you want to know where are we living in, look at Israel. I have told you about the eastern gate [Music] that it is about to open. I said the prophet Ezekiel said it shall be shut and it was shut and it is still shut. But now it is shivery some cracks in Israel. There are some topics in Israel nowadays. They are about they are about those people of Israel. They are about to build a third temple. You know what is the third temple? The first one &gt;&gt; was called Solomon's temple. &gt;&gt; That is the first temple. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; And it was destroyed by the forces of Babylon led by Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? Amen. The first temple was destroyed by the forces of baby led by Nebuchadnezzar. That is the first temple and restored by men like you know about that where we have read Jesus was pro Jesus was prophesied &gt;&gt; about his destruction this this second temple &gt;&gt; because the first one was destroyed by forces of Babylon. When Jesus was speaking here with the disciples, the disciples, the temple, the disciples was admiring it was the second temple. Are you together with me there? And Jesus said, &gt;&gt; this one, it is going to be destroyed. And when I'm talking now here, it is destroyed. &gt;&gt; It is destroyed by the forces, Roman forces led by Titus AD70 AD70. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? As I'm speaking now, in the place of that temple, there is the temple of Muhammad. &gt;&gt; It is built on that foundation. &gt;&gt; No. I said there is some saying &gt;&gt; that now in Israel. They want to build a third because Daniel prophesied that it will be rebuilt. It will be destroyed and it will be rebuilt. That is what Daniel said. Then now they are talking about to rebuild it. And even our prophet said &gt;&gt; it will be rebuilt. &gt;&gt; We know that &gt;&gt; that it will be rebuilt. &gt;&gt; Then um they are making ready for the rebuilding of the third temple. &gt;&gt; Not long they were making a of the the sacrifice the sacrifice which which make the water of separation. It is the sacrifice which they sacrifice the red hiver. They've got those red hives, three of them, but they they they tried to sacrifice one to make that water because they can't start doing that temple as they as they are. be sprinkled with the water of sacrifice. When they tried to make that sacrifice, they found that this hybr disqualified me. They said we shall stand again. Why are these people doing these things? &gt;&gt; I know &gt;&gt; that these things of rebuilding this the temple. Put my picture there. I know these things of building the third temple which will happen there at the last three and a half years. I know we know that the building of the third temple it will be built during the third the last three and a half years. But what are these people doing? because they they already have the plan. They've already have them the articles which are which are used in the temple. They have only have those things but we know it is going to be done in the last three and a half years when the bride is not here. When this when these people are are shivering going this way and this way, it means your time is over these things. If they start they now they have a problem of that monster there which is upon the foundation. They've they they've made a a a a group of people that must discuss that this thing. &gt;&gt; We must build our temple. They say is going to come into this temple. The temple must be ready. The Messiah is ready to come. He must just come. He mustn't come. He will never come if our temple is not. &gt;&gt; But we know. Read the verse again. Isaiah chapter 6. chapter 6 verse one. Come and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn and he will heal us. He hath smitten and he will bind us up. &gt;&gt; After two days will he revive us. In the third day, he will rise us up &gt;&gt; and we shall live in his sight. Then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord, his going forth is prepared as the morning, and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former reign unto the earth. This is the prophecy prophet. &gt;&gt; This prophecies is the prophecy of our side. You see, when you go to burials, funerals, you find pastors trying to comfort people at those funerals. Reading this scripture, saying this, you are torn apart. God will bind you. They don't know what this scripture say. The scripture is talking about Israel. &gt;&gt; God was saying to the children of Israel, &gt;&gt; he said, um, I had turned and he will heal you. &gt;&gt; He hasen us. and he will bind us. He said, "Now after two days he will receive us and in the third day he will raise us up. He has already heal bind them and healed them and he has already they were scattered. He has gathered them again. In other words, he has binded them now. He has healed them now. But now we are living in death. Because when they say the second day because one day with God is 1,000. In other words, after 2,000 he will raise them up. And on the third day he will make them he give them life. What is life is will give them the holy spirit. Now they are there they are healed bound. They have to be now they say at the on the on the second day we are living in the second day. We expect them &gt;&gt; to be raised. To be re to raise to be revived to be raised is to be revived. They must be they must have a revival. But to have a revival there must come two prophets. Read it my brother. They just read it. I just read Revelation chapter 11, I believe. So, &gt;&gt; verse three. Revelation 11:3. And I will give power unto my two witnesses &gt;&gt; and they shall prophesy 1,23 score days in sec. &gt;&gt; This he said I will give power unto my tweet witnesses is Moses and Elijah. He said they will prophesy &gt;&gt; 2000 200360 that is 360 three and a half years are you together with me in other words when the bread goes these two witness will come because they will start the last three and a half years. It start by them. When the bride goes up, they come down. They start to preach. They the one who will raise them, they will raise these children of Israel because he said on the third day, on the second day, I will raise them. Then these two, they will revive them. The message of these two will revive them. Then after they are revived, they will receive the Holy Spirit because he said on the third day, I will give them life. Now we are living in the day where they can be raised because we are living after after this the second day. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are we are going to the third day &gt;&gt; where he will give them life. &gt;&gt; The message of these two will give them life. &gt;&gt; For for us to get the message, &gt;&gt; Israel was blinded. For them to get the message, you must be blinded. The Gentiles must be blinded. When they are blinded, then the message will go back. And they are already blinded. I was saying to the children of God to hear the word it depends on the capacity &gt;&gt; because 2 liter container. It takes only two liter water. If you can try to pour three liter, it will overflow to to hear the word. It depends on the capacity. That's why Lutherans during the time of Luther they could they could only carry capacity of the just shall live by faith. But when you try to put scientific overflows in our time now, there are some people who their capacity can only carry. God has sent us a prophet. They can carry from there. It overflows. When you tell them about the revelation 10 verse one, when you tell them about that one, you say, "Hey, you will confuse people." Do you mean the Holy Ghost is not more? What do you mean? Because it overflows [Music] their capacity. is food. &gt;&gt; They could they cannot receive any more. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Let us close our eyes. [Applause] Mighty heavenly father, &gt;&gt; thank you for this message. &gt;&gt; We have seen, we have fret. &gt;&gt; Amen. When messages were given, sometimes Satan will try to make you to say something which is not the right thing. But we pray heavenly father &gt;&gt; that if some things which are like that &gt;&gt; which have ever came out of my mouth, Let them not get into your children's hearts. &gt;&gt; Let only those things which are from you &gt;&gt; get into your children's hearts. &gt;&gt; We're living in the last days. &gt;&gt; This is the final. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The marriage is about to &gt;&gt; the the last call of the re is about to rain. &gt;&gt; Lord, these messages are those which will make the bride ready. &gt;&gt; He says a brick upon a brick &gt;&gt; building us to the place &gt;&gt; where we can know who we are &gt;&gt; because you said the time the bride knows who they are &gt;&gt; the rapt shall take place &gt;&gt; help us Lord as we are here &gt;&gt; as we go step by step &gt;&gt; help us to move with you &gt;&gt; we pray if there is anyone No one here has come here not knowing &gt;&gt; you know each and everyone's hearts &gt;&gt; and we know what we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly father when we move from this house going to our different places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be with us I pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom he hath crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. Wait, [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Luna Jesus.
