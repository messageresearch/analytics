[25:56] 22 he says let me say this right
[26:02] here that every trumpet
[26:11] [Music]
[26:14] blow because the seven seal there was
[26:23] silence no one knew that was the minute
[26:27] or hour that Christ would
[26:36] come the Bible
[26:39] says no one will
[26:45] know the
[26:48] [Applause]
[26:53] father
[26:55] now no one knew who Jesus
[27:03] was then he asked and said who do you
[27:06] say I the son of
[27:15] am and he said
[27:22] th and the Lord Jesus said that's a
[27:26] revelation
[27:27] [Music]
[27:38] Peter flesh and blood not revealed to
[27:53] you so in the last
[27:56] days no man will it to you but the
[28:04] Father the Bible says even the
[28:10] know the Bible says even the son don't
[28:14] know
[28:17] [Music]
[28:21] comus Christ has left the sanctuary
[28:30] and then we come in as the
[28:34] [Music]
[28:39] sons the son
[28:43] was when Adam
[28:47] fell God came and took the place of Adam
[28:51] in the form of the
[28:59] [Applause]
[29:04] not
[29:08] himself he came in as a
[29:12] [Music]
[29:16] substitute because that place is the
[29:19] place of
[29:24] men God
[29:26] came and took the
[29:29] place as
[29:34] aute the form
[29:39] ofus
[29:43] when God had put
[29:48] some with a
[29:51] sword to the way of the Tree of Life
[29:59] no man could go
[30:02] back until the place is
[30:13] redeemed it
[30:17] was until God redeemed brother
[30:32] then
[30:34] [Music]
[30:37] he now
[30:39] as a redeemed
[30:49] Adam had the
[30:54] brook when he fed the book God took it
[31:03] and drove him out of
[31:09] the out of the East
[31:16] Gate
[31:18] says now we have seven
[31:22] angels lead back to the
[31:30] because we are going
[31:35] back so the seven
[31:38] angels are leading back to the again
[31:58] after
[32:01] red God gave that
[32:21] to guarding the way of the Tree of Life
[32:29] it
[32:32] waset
[32:38] soet no one could come
[32:42] there without first being
[32:47] redeemed and the to go
[32:52] back
[32:54] Hallelujah so the seven seal opened the
[32:57] gate
[33:15] that was in the
[33:26] of when he received
[33:29] it it was like sword in
[33:39] the
[33:41] later when when it
[34:00] so
[34:18] theam that is the
[34:25] seven which is the
[34:28] Mar certificate of
[34:39] the without this seven s book you are
[34:42] not married
[35:00] amen you have a
[35:03] certificate you have a
[35:21] certificate uh the Bible
[35:26] says the Lord
[35:29] Jesus stood up and took the
[35:34] book Because when he
[35:38] died he went back and became a
[35:48] mediator until we are
[35:55] all to take our
[36:03] positions we had no right to to open the
[36:09] book as we were in a fallen
[36:15] State now God had to redeem us
[36:27] because our Nam were
[36:33] in
[36:51] the to receive
[36:58] and
[36:59] until we
[37:14] qualify the marriage
[37:19] officer supp us with the
[37:40] ISS that's why they will
[37:46] say the seven seal is revealed
[37:57] then they
[38:14] take
[38:16] because this is the revelation of the
[38:20] seven s
[38:30] so it's not the grou for the people with
[38:48] sixs a church with six seals must
[38:51] produce their six seal book this one is
[38:55] seven
[39:18] now Revelation chter
[39:22] 5 the Bible says he he took the book
[39:29] now now you know brother
[39:32] says the lamb took the
[39:43] book
[39:45] right the people in the
[39:50] denomination they believe that there was
[39:53] a throne and a man on the throne
[39:57] is
