there was only before there was any disease you existed so even this morning we are here to worship thee because we know you your thoughts started because [Music] and we shall meet you in the end because we were with you you may be seated and now you know when we were in malawi we are seeing the same surprise about the where mostly we were on the right hand side of course because the bible says here we back a little up and that is revelation chapter 5. this is what the bible says um oh read my brother you can go faster than i am is he's earning his own to what you have seen and have known uloco when there is a war they call the veterans [Music] [Music] you know as peter says peter we were with him in the holy mountain and our eyewitnesses as i narrated this again [Music] but there were some what do you call this newspaper people uh from the place the figure in the wind and the writing came like this that this is now the news and i took note of that news then i sat down now forgetting all about the other newspapers and so forth now i wanted to hear the news from there is from the inside there could have been some newspapers but when somewhere saying this no money nobody has to put you into a constitution and the weight will be held only by those you have rejected life me then i can't rest until i know we have again [Music] because he says he went that way reflected in your soul i'm [Music] europe christ in you i'm repeating but you is not actually [Music] i'm not saying this to everybody maggity when just like began everybody and you will receive it now the message comes to your in you now you can just say christ everybody can say christ okay but only [Music] because god himself is an object of god [Music] because you [Music] a man i was thinking

to look up like this every time maybe somebody can do something and lower it a bit i know that we are looking at the people back there but we still can lower this thing talking to somebody about it is it possible people who will be raptured oh but i will start here but today the rapture is a revelation to her take note of that i've had a look there it's not just a scripture because without revelation that's why paul says you are written a pistols name read of all means did you hear him meaning that m because he thought of uh coming down to us he has to come in the same station as is all right amen i was saying to my brother this message is the revelation of the word says we you god has made you imagine because it's those supernatural things now let's look at this i guess rapture is a revelation that the revelation the true bride of christ [Music] makes a wonderful you yourself as the scripture says you yourself know that we are the lord and it says now christ's life in you have you ever experienced [Music] what is god said to me stop yeah it's don't go this way amen but if you can do something against me you are not his son i will see you in the terminal is in that way he snatched him sweet from the devil even about the the some written woman is [Music] [Music] [Applause] uh [Applause] now here wait yes [Music] yes you can bring the historical part of that letter still
