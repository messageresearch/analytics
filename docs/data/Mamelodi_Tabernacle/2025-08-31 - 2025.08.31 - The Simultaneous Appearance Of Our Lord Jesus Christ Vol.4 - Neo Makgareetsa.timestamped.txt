[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:12] Be well.

[1:06:18] [Music]
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Welcome.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Holy
[1:06:30] Ghost
[1:06:36] with power.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Come
[1:06:39] with power.
[1:06:42] his
[1:06:45] power.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost,
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost, we welcome
[1:06:58] thee.
[1:07:01] I
[1:07:05] I greet you all this morning
[1:07:09] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:07:11] Christ.
[1:07:14] I believe God is still good to our life.
[1:07:19] He is the same yesterday, today and
[1:07:21] forever.
[1:07:24] As long as there's a breath in our
[1:07:26] lungs,
[1:07:30] We will keep on worshiping him
[1:07:34] even this morning.
[1:07:37] We will share the will of God
[1:07:40] to keep the wheel turning.
[1:07:45] Amen. Amen. I have the greetings from
[1:07:48] our pastor again this morning.
[1:07:52] [Music]
[1:07:54] He said, "I must tell you that
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:07:58] he's okay.
[1:08:00] He's just in a recovering mode.
[1:08:05] He will see. He will see you sooner.
[1:08:09] Just keep on praying for him.
[1:08:14] He He's praying for you as well."
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I saw him praying for the people
[1:08:25] while he was at the hospital.
[1:08:28] Then I realized
[1:08:31] the only thing that the pastor knows
[1:08:35] is nothing but the word of God.
[1:08:40] I have testimonies as well.
[1:08:44] what sister do was saying the previous
[1:08:46] week.
[1:08:50] I'm the eyewitness.
[1:08:53] I've seen everything
[1:08:56] and how God does things.
[1:09:02] Um when brother Brenam was at the
[1:09:05] hospital,
[1:09:08] it happened that
[1:09:10] he departed.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He departed with our feet.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; And then brother Perry Green,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; brother Perry Green
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; has to call Billy Paul
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; telling him that
[1:09:28] your father is dead.
[1:09:31] Then Bill was just looking at brother
[1:09:34] Perry.
[1:09:37] Then brother Perry realized that
[1:09:40] there's a problem with Bill.
[1:09:43] I have to do something about
[1:09:46] he gave him
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; a hot clap.
[1:09:54] You know why?
[1:09:56] If he didn't do that,
[1:09:59] Billy Paul was going to be dramatized
[1:10:03] his entire life.
[1:10:06] There are certain things in life
[1:10:10] when they happen
[1:10:12] you don't feel the pain
[1:10:16] but maybe after 10 or 15 years
[1:10:22] comes
[1:10:24] that hot
[1:10:27] was to make Bill Paul
[1:10:29] to face the reality
[1:10:33] to to get shock talk of a little bit
[1:10:38] that moment so that tomorrow he will be
[1:10:42] fine.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; So I I've seen that when we were at the
[1:10:51] with the pastor at the hospital,
[1:10:55] the doctors,
[1:10:57] the nurses
[1:11:00] said they don't understand what kind of
[1:11:02] a being he is.
[1:11:06] When he come out of the theater,
[1:11:09] [Music]
[1:11:11] he was as normal as he was going into
[1:11:14] the
[1:11:17] I saw Indian doctors.
[1:11:21] You you see those with some red wools
[1:11:24] here
[1:11:27] asking the prayers from the pastor
[1:11:31] while he is in the hospital.
[1:11:36] Then I said
[1:11:39] it's something else.
[1:11:42] Amen. Amen. So we they they see
[1:11:45] something that they haven't seen before.
[1:11:50] I'm telling you
[1:11:53] when we were there
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; just to give you briefly
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; but sister do said it all.
[1:12:04] Oh, maybe sit down for a few seconds.
[1:12:08] Uh when I was entering where the pastor
[1:12:10] was sitting,
[1:12:15] he called me.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Then he said to me, "Hey, Bruce,
[1:12:21] is the program ready?"
[1:12:25] I said, "Yeah, pastor, everything is
[1:12:27] fine."
[1:12:29] Pastor Mua preached Sundays
[1:12:33] preaching
[1:12:35] and the program is fine.
[1:12:38] Then he he laughed at me. He said, "Hey,
[1:12:41] you don't understand,
[1:12:43] bro. Jesus is here to take me back home.
[1:12:49] I mean funeral program."
[1:12:52] Then I was shaking.
[1:12:56] I said, "No, pastor. that one we can't
[1:13:00] do because you are here.
[1:13:04] He said yes, but I'm here beating you
[1:13:08] goodbye.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus is here to take me home.
[1:13:16] I feel like this one is above me now.
[1:13:20] I don't know how
[1:13:23] coming in
[1:13:25] stand on the other side of the beach.
[1:13:28] I was on this side in the middle and
[1:13:32] then
[1:13:36] they beyond me.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; I said now the pastor is talking things.
[1:13:41] Then listen to the pastor again. When he
[1:13:44] was saying I'm going
[1:13:48] then said to him when you come here you
[1:13:52] were alive. When you leave this
[1:13:54] hospital,
[1:13:56] you will be alive.
[1:13:58] I'm not going to allow
[1:14:02] that we should take you out of the
[1:14:04] hospital with a coffin.
[1:14:09] She said it boldly.
[1:14:12] Then I was just there folding my arms.
[1:14:15] That was the 22nd of July. 22 July. Then
[1:14:21] the the hours passed by
[1:14:25] while we were sitting.
[1:14:28] We just saw the nurses throwing their
[1:14:31] scene and their bags and everything.
[1:14:36] We sang youced.
[1:14:42] That time
[1:14:44] the pastor was gone to glory.
[1:14:50] And then later
[1:14:52] there was laughter in the room
[1:14:56] and they called the family. They say you
[1:14:59] are dead
[1:15:01] was gone. The machine was off.
[1:15:05] But after he came back things were like
[1:15:07] just normal.
[1:15:10] Then those that are in the medical
[1:15:13] department or the medical field rather
[1:15:19] They say if someone was like that he
[1:15:24] won't be like the same
[1:15:27] for the whole week. Maybe will recover
[1:15:30] later
[1:15:33] but after that things were normal
[1:15:37] in the machines.
[1:15:39] Things comes to normal again and then we
[1:15:42] even talk like nothing happened.
[1:15:48] Amen.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; So it just came to my mind
[1:15:55] that God is doing something here
[1:15:59] because we sometimes preach
[1:16:03] and when we preach but when the reality
[1:16:06] come
[1:16:08] is like we didn't preach because when we
[1:16:11] face the reality
[1:16:13] we start to shake.
[1:16:16] Something came to me and say when we
[1:16:19] preach about Joshua, Joshua,
[1:16:22] Joshua is one man whom was sent by God
[1:16:26] or Moses
[1:16:29] to the promised land
[1:16:31] and come back with the fruits
[1:16:35] of the land. Then I say, but we also
[1:16:38] preach
[1:16:40] pastors are Joshua.
[1:16:43] Means our pastor is Joshua.
[1:16:46] Meaning somewhere somehow he has to go
[1:16:50] to the promised land and come back with
[1:16:54] the fruit of the lamb.
[1:16:57] So pastor went to glory land and come
[1:17:01] back with the fruit
[1:17:04] of the lamb.
[1:17:07] So
[1:17:09] time passed by we were sitting
[1:17:13] I visited him 11:00 in the morning in a
[1:17:19] private place where he was.
[1:17:22] Then he said to me, "Ruth, I I see
[1:17:25] things and I've seen things. God has
[1:17:29] shown me a lot of things. I even saw
[1:17:34] I tremble again.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Then he look at me. You say, "Why does
[1:17:41] it look like you're afraid?"
[1:17:48] You can't say, "Yes, I'm afraid." You
[1:17:49] just say, "Don't worry. I saw you there
[1:17:54] with your family." Amen.
[1:17:58] I said, "Oh,
[1:18:01] ah, this day I will never forget.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Why are we coming to the service every
[1:18:06] day?
[1:18:08] When the reality comes,
[1:18:11] we we tremble.
[1:18:13] We are here
[1:18:15] to see ourselves
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; in the rapture
[1:18:19] because the rapture is the first journey
[1:18:23] that take us to the new Jerusalem.
[1:18:27] So if the pastor said he saw us there is
[1:18:31] the done deal.
[1:18:36] So when I walk,
[1:18:41] who is in the rapture? This one is in
[1:18:44] the rapture
[1:18:46] and you were there
[1:18:49] because the pastor said, I saw rapture
[1:18:53] the children of God going up. But
[1:18:56] luckily, he said to me, I was there.
[1:19:01] So I I no longer worry about the things
[1:19:05] of the world. Everything that is
[1:19:08] happening to me, God knows about it.
[1:19:16] Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Anything
[1:19:18] that is happening to you, God knows
[1:19:22] about you.
[1:19:24] You don't have a a right
[1:19:27] to worry this morning. Don't worry.
[1:19:31] God never made a mistake.
[1:19:35] Everything is pre-planned.
[1:19:40] You must just walk on the path that God
[1:19:44] has prepared for you.
[1:19:47] And that's all.
[1:19:49] Amen. Amen. When things are not going
[1:19:52] your way,
[1:19:54] God knows why.
[1:19:57] Wait upon him at the right time. You
[1:20:01] will know why. There are certain things
[1:20:04] you do not understand but God
[1:20:06] understand.
[1:20:09] So you just relax upon the word of God.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; So we are not worshiping in vain.
[1:20:21] No no no no.
[1:20:24] You worship because you are a worshipper
[1:20:29] to begin with.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; This morning I want to continue with
[1:20:37] that message
[1:20:39] of millennium
[1:20:41] and preach half of it
[1:20:44] and the remaining half we will finish it
[1:20:49] today. But because it was a women's
[1:20:52] month,
[1:20:54] I God gave me the message about the
[1:20:57] encouraging our sisters.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; So I had part two of that message
[1:21:06] of women of valor,
[1:21:10] but God did not allow me to preach it
[1:21:13] today.
[1:21:15] is the last day of the month
[1:21:18] because men can hate you.
[1:21:22] men.
[1:21:27] You know in life when you preach that
[1:21:30] kind of a message
[1:21:32] and a brother tried to do something in
[1:21:34] the house.
[1:21:38] [Music]
[1:21:42] Put the message of the woman of Bala
[1:21:51] while you are still trying to wash the
[1:21:53] car.
[1:21:55] Sister say the word of God comes first.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; What she mean that sit and listen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; It's life.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Let's enjoy life.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Same thing.
[1:22:09] If you can preach and be hard on women,
[1:22:14] brother will will go to the sister and
[1:22:17] brother will go to the sister.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; You must say amen. Amen.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Because it's on the other side. When
[1:22:25] it's on the it's it's life. Let's just
[1:22:28] enjoy life. This is the word of God.
[1:22:31] It's for men. It's for women. It's for
[1:22:35] youth. and it goes all part so that we
[1:22:39] can grow in the word of God. Don't be
[1:22:42] angry. Just say God you know better. And
[1:22:47] if the message is talking about you
[1:22:50] rectifying you,
[1:22:54] thank you God.
[1:22:58] Because one man who did not thank God
[1:23:02] for the message that came to him was
[1:23:06] Kane
[1:23:08] was Kane. I hope we don't have Kane this
[1:23:12] morning, but we have people from the
[1:23:15] lineage of Abel and said,
[1:23:19] you know, until today, let's enjoy the
[1:23:23] word of God. And I normally those that
[1:23:26] normally talk to me,
[1:23:29] I normally said to them, if you have
[1:23:32] problems, just be like myself.
[1:23:39] Even if you can make me angry, I just
[1:23:41] rejoice.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; If you can hate me, I will love you
[1:23:44] more.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; I don't worry.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Or is anyone of you who said I hate him
[1:23:52] because of one
[1:23:59] there's no one.
[1:24:01] That is why as children of God,
[1:24:04] let's impart love.
[1:24:08] Because the Bible says, "Love until you
[1:24:12] love your own enemy."
[1:24:16] Jesus looked at the young rich man
[1:24:19] and loved him.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Though he rejected the message,
[1:24:24] he just loved him. Those that hate you,
[1:24:28] just love them
[1:24:30] because you are love
[1:24:34] and God is love.
[1:24:38] Let's stand to our feet. I love this
[1:24:41] hymn.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Then we enjoy the word of God.
[1:24:51] Amen.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] [Music]
[1:25:04] Oh
[1:25:05] god, I see
[1:25:12] a beyond.
[1:25:21] [Music]
[1:25:25] [Applause]
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:44] God.
[1:25:46] [Applause]
[1:25:59] Oh
[1:26:28] He's all
[1:26:32] [Music]
[1:26:43] in the morning.
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:27:04] You want to see
[1:27:08] [Music]
[1:27:11] what I want.
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:23] Let's bow our heads and pray.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Gracious and eternal father,
[1:27:29] we are thankful this morning for
[1:27:32] breaking the eyes. We know Lord God for
[1:27:36] us to leave our house to come to the
[1:27:38] temple is not an easy way. But heavenly
[1:27:43] father here we are this morning
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; with the great anticipation
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; because we want to hear from above.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; We know Lord God this morning when we
[1:27:53] come there are those that are weary and
[1:27:57] afflated Lord God.
[1:28:00] May you help us Lord as this word is
[1:28:02] coming forth
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; so that the way we came to the church
[1:28:07] should not be the same as we are going
[1:28:09] home
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; because you'll be talking to us in a
[1:28:13] special way
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; and one thing I know about Lord God you
[1:28:17] never disappointed us
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; everything that is happening in our life
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; you know them but as human being we may
[1:28:26] think otherwise but you know better
[1:28:30] We are going to read the portion of the
[1:28:32] scripture from that scripture Lord and
[1:28:35] the quote from the prophet and our lives
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; should always look up to thee because
[1:28:41] you are the only absolute in our lives.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; I'm just a vessel this morning Lord God
[1:28:47] with our precious brother harst. Lord
[1:28:49] God
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; do as you do all the time
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; as we talk heavenly father.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the heaven speak through us to
[1:29:00] your children.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; For we only need a comfort from you.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we love you so much.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Because you first love us.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Talk to us this morning, Lord God.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; As we believe in thy word and believe
[1:29:18] everything
[1:29:19] uh good and well unto your capable hands
[1:29:22] in the mighty name of our Lord and
[1:29:24] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Let's open it in the book of uh Isaiah
[1:29:33] chapter 65
[1:29:40] verse 21
[1:29:43] only.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; It reads as follows. Isaiah 65:21.
[1:29:49] And they shall build houses and inhabit
[1:29:51] them, and they shall plant vineyards and
[1:29:54] eat the fruit of them.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; And let's go to Revelation 20,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; verse 1-3.
[1:30:09] Revelation 21-3.
[1:30:13] And I saw an angel come down from heaven
[1:30:16] having the key of the bottomless pit and
[1:30:18] a great chain in his hand. And he laid
[1:30:22] hold on the dragon that old serpent
[1:30:24] which is the devil and Satan and bound
[1:30:27] him a thousand years.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; And cast him into the bottomless pit and
[1:30:33] shut him up and set a seal upon him that
[1:30:36] he should deceive the nations no more
[1:30:39] till the thousand years should be
[1:30:40] fulfilled. Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; And after that he must be loosed a
[1:30:44] little season.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; We we we continue about this thousand
[1:30:56] years,
[1:30:58] a millennium
[1:31:00] because it's time and we are still on
[1:31:03] time.
[1:31:05] Amen. Amen. So, we were talking about us
[1:31:10] in the previous message
[1:31:12] about the millennium
[1:31:14] when we get there and live there. But I
[1:31:18] never said anything
[1:31:20] about the Jewish
[1:31:23] unbelievers and the foolish vision. So,
[1:31:27] I want us to take that part so that it
[1:31:30] can be concluded.
[1:31:33] Amen. Amen. Well, brother Brennham says
[1:31:38] on the message called scriptural sign of
[1:31:40] the time,
[1:31:43] I will read,
[1:31:45] God gave Solomon a gift
[1:31:47] and all the whole church.
[1:31:50] Everybody believed it.
[1:31:52] That was a millennium for the Jews.
[1:31:56] That was the Old Testament millennium
[1:32:01] in the days of Solomon.
[1:32:04] A foreshadow of the millennium to come.
[1:32:08] The golden age of the Jews.
[1:32:13] Notice nobody started war with them.
[1:32:18] They feared them because they know their
[1:32:21] God was real.
[1:32:24] Because they had him in their presence
[1:32:28] and the people was all one heart and one
[1:32:30] accord.
[1:32:34] Why the fame went everywhere
[1:32:39] everywhere and you hear
[1:32:42] what a great thing
[1:32:44] God of Israel
[1:32:47] a living God. I I always say or is the
[1:32:51] Bible and brother Benam is teaching us
[1:32:55] that a journey of Israelites
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; naturally is our age
[1:33:03] and the age we are living in or the life
[1:33:06] we are living
[1:33:08] for the bride
[1:33:10] supernaturally
[1:33:12] are the same.
[1:33:15] their natural journey
[1:33:18] is like unto our spiritual journey.
[1:33:21] If they had their millennium,
[1:33:24] we will have our millennium.
[1:33:27] Millennium was 40 years. Millennium.
[1:33:31] Our millennium is thousand years.
[1:33:35] God has honored us so much.
[1:33:39] He gave us a thousand years
[1:33:42] in the millennia.
[1:33:44] As Adam was in the Garden of Eden,
[1:33:47] he was supposed to live there
[1:33:50] for a thousand years, but he couldn't
[1:33:52] complete it. But we shall complete it
[1:33:57] because God is honoring us. If that was
[1:34:01] the golden age of the Jewish,
[1:34:04] it will be our golden age in the
[1:34:06] beginning.
[1:34:10] We think of this
[1:34:13] Solomon in that great millennium of the
[1:34:15] Jewish
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; that when no nation dare to touch them
[1:34:22] and that great gift of God was in the
[1:34:24] prophet
[1:34:27] till he made known
[1:34:29] to the queen
[1:34:32] of all of her secrets of her heart.
[1:34:36] Nothing was withheld
[1:34:39] the great age
[1:34:42] showing and typing that there was a
[1:34:45] great age coming.
[1:34:49] The great age that is coming. They were
[1:34:52] brother Ben is referring to us.
[1:34:56] Amen. Amen. Now that was what happened
[1:35:01] during the time of the Jewish with their
[1:35:04] millennium.
[1:35:06] Now our message
[1:35:09] start with this quote
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; from the exposition of the seven church
[1:35:13] ages.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Listen to this.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; It is the second resurrection
[1:35:21] where the five foolish visions
[1:35:25] come out.
[1:35:26] noticed that they were vigils.
[1:35:30] They did not have Holy Spirit.
[1:35:34] So they miss being in the bride.
[1:35:40] While the five wise
[1:35:43] who had oil
[1:35:46] became part of that bride.
[1:35:50] But these people being separated,
[1:35:54] God loving people
[1:35:57] and
[1:35:59] I want to say let's let's repeat it.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; But these people being separated,
[1:36:06] God loving people.
[1:36:09] No, no. In fact, it's
[1:36:13] Yes. Amen. And trying to abide in the
[1:36:17] way.
[1:36:19] Indeed,
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; according to what they knew of it,
[1:36:26] and being a help in the work of the Lord
[1:36:30] will come up at the end of time,
[1:36:35] but they will miss millennia,
[1:36:40] which you can begin to see
[1:36:44] by this truth is much more important.
[1:36:49] and wonderful
[1:36:51] than we have ever thought or believe.
[1:36:56] Our Lord Jesus Christ was giving an
[1:37:00] example
[1:37:01] about the 10 visions.
[1:37:04] The five that had oil in their lamp
[1:37:09] and the other five did not had oil in
[1:37:13] their lamp. They did not have the Holy
[1:37:18] Spirit. So the five
[1:37:21] saw the groom,
[1:37:24] but the other five couldn't see the
[1:37:26] groom. That's what brother Abraham is
[1:37:29] talking about this morning. You were the
[1:37:32] five visions
[1:37:34] that saw the groom, the one that had the
[1:37:38] Holy Spirit, the oil in their lamp. But
[1:37:42] there are people out there, very people,
[1:37:46] God loving people.
[1:37:49] You you see they are trying to abide the
[1:37:53] word of God, but they will never be in
[1:37:58] the millennium. And you will be in the
[1:38:02] millennium.
[1:38:04] You will be in the millennium
[1:38:07] because you know the word of God better
[1:38:11] than them. But it is because he loved
[1:38:15] you before the foundation.
[1:38:18] He chose you before the foundation of
[1:38:21] the world. If God
[1:38:24] did chose you, you don't have a right to
[1:38:28] boast. You don't have a right to
[1:38:31] belittle others. Just humble yourself
[1:38:35] and remain a child of God.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; There are people out there
[1:38:47] that dress
[1:38:49] more perfect than our sisters,
[1:38:53] but they will never be in the millennia.
[1:38:57] Those that will be in the millennia is
[1:39:00] the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:39:03] whom he chose
[1:39:05] unconditionally.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; The unconditional love of God
[1:39:13] abide in us.
[1:39:16] He just loved us.
[1:39:18] Amen. Amen. It's like when choosing a
[1:39:20] wife,
[1:39:22] you just look at her and your heart
[1:39:25] tells you this is the one. When you
[1:39:29] choose her, you chose her forever.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; No comment.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Be honest with me this morning.
[1:39:49] Many people want exit
[1:39:54] in their marriages.
[1:39:57] When when we say when I say be honest
[1:39:59] with me,
[1:40:01] I want to ask you this question.
[1:40:04] How would we be
[1:40:07] if Christ our groom one of the day said
[1:40:13] to us, I need an exit
[1:40:17] in this marriage.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; So who are we taking after?
[1:40:30] Amen.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Because when you love someone
[1:40:36] unconditionally,
[1:40:38] he can she can shout at you.
[1:40:42] You just look at him, I love you so
[1:40:44] much.
[1:40:49] Be honest with me.
[1:40:52] You sometimes lie.
[1:40:57] You are quiet because you think you are
[1:40:59] not lying.
[1:41:01] You sometimes lie. You sometimes take
[1:41:04] the offering,
[1:41:06] sometimes do things contrary to the word
[1:41:08] of God.
[1:41:10] But Jesus just look at you and say, "I
[1:41:13] love you."
[1:41:15] [Applause]
[1:41:17] Why? You have faith or or you are you
[1:41:21] are real you.
[1:41:23] Behold
[1:41:25] the face of the father.
[1:41:28] He looks at you from what is in front of
[1:41:33] him
[1:41:35] irrespective of your condition.
[1:41:38] He will never propose and exit
[1:41:44] method in the marriage that he has with
[1:41:48] you.
[1:41:49] [Applause]
[1:41:51] The Bible says
[1:41:52] The one that used to report
[1:41:56] used report you to him,
[1:42:00] he does not have that chance again.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; The devil
[1:42:09] does not have access to the sixth
[1:42:10] dimension nor seven dimension anymore.
[1:42:16] He will come from the fifth dimension
[1:42:19] to this world and go to the fifth
[1:42:21] dimension to this world. But a child of
[1:42:25] God can go to the fifth dimension to the
[1:42:30] sixth dimension to all the dimension
[1:42:33] because God has give us the access
[1:42:37] to hell
[1:42:39] death
[1:42:41] heaven
[1:42:43] as a child of God but the devil doesn't
[1:42:46] have an access
[1:42:48] that is why our pastor can go
[1:42:52] die and come back and say we'll go
[1:42:55] together
[1:42:57] because I have seen what is happening in
[1:43:02] glory land.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; So if you miss rapture,
[1:43:13] if you miss rapture, you will not be in
[1:43:16] the millennia.
[1:43:19] The rapture. It's a carrier to the
[1:43:23] millennium. Once you are in the
[1:43:25] millennium, it's not a rest place. You
[1:43:29] are in the journey to the new city that
[1:43:32] is eternal.
[1:43:36] If you can miss rapture,
[1:43:39] you'll never be in the millennium.
[1:43:42] That is why the foolish vision
[1:43:47] will miss rapture.
[1:43:50] That is why they will not be part of the
[1:43:54] bride in the new millennium.
[1:44:00] Amen. Amen.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; But this vision
[1:44:04] one of the days
[1:44:06] God will really bear for them.
[1:44:11] Amen. Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; But it's not the message for today.
[1:44:14] When we go after white throne judgment,
[1:44:18] you will see. But today is about
[1:44:22] millennia.
[1:44:24] Now they ask brother a question
[1:44:27] when the millennium start.
[1:44:30] How will the unbeliever
[1:44:32] be taken off of the earth?
[1:44:37] The unbelievers
[1:44:39] will go down in the tribulation period
[1:44:44] with the sleeping vision.
[1:44:47] They will go through the tribulation.
[1:44:51] Those sleeping visions with the
[1:44:54] unbelievers will go through the
[1:44:57] tribulation.
[1:44:58] and all those
[1:45:01] unbelievers
[1:45:03] and sleeping vision and the remnant of
[1:45:07] Israel
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; that's to be taken out.
[1:45:13] So meaning when we raptured
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; will be with Israel
[1:45:23] revealing himself that when they crucify
[1:45:27] him they were crucifying
[1:45:30] their savior but it was done purposely
[1:45:35] so that Jesus can come in for his bride.
[1:45:41] When that is happening,
[1:45:43] spontaneously
[1:45:45] the Gentiles will be in tribulation.
[1:45:49] That same time, the bride will be
[1:45:53] raptured. Now, when we have raptured for
[1:45:58] the three and a half years going into
[1:46:00] the millennium,
[1:46:03] when we are in the millennium,
[1:46:05] we will be with him.
[1:46:09] But now we are not with him.
[1:46:13] Him in us.
[1:46:16] He is in us.
[1:46:19] But in the millennium, he will be with
[1:46:22] us.
[1:46:24] We will see him. He will see us. Then
[1:46:28] God in us now is God with us
[1:46:33] in the millennium
[1:46:35] telling us all the secret.
[1:46:40] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; That you know what we are in a journey
[1:46:44] for thousand years. I honor you for
[1:46:48] abiding
[1:46:50] my way.
[1:46:52] We will be
[1:46:55] with him for thousand years. But the
[1:46:58] unbelievers
[1:47:00] and the sleeping vision will not be in
[1:47:04] the millennium. Where will the Jew be?
[1:47:08] 144 years
[1:47:10] will be in the millennium
[1:47:14] with us. But not the bride. There will
[1:47:19] not be the bride. It will be the king
[1:47:24] and the queen and the servants.
[1:47:29] That's what will will be happening
[1:47:32] in the millennium. You see the Jewish
[1:47:35] now they have all what the world needs
[1:47:41] naturally. We do not have we are poor.
[1:47:46] We don't have those money. We don't have
[1:47:49] those gold and diamonds
[1:47:51] because God never called us for such.
[1:47:56] But come rapture, come millennium, those
[1:48:02] that we are saving today, they will be
[1:48:06] the one to save us.
[1:48:11] Amen. Amen. So from that time after
[1:48:14] rapture we will be the real queen
[1:48:20] of the king
[1:48:22] that that is the plan of God
[1:48:26] about us. So nothing
[1:48:29] will be left undone.
[1:48:32] Unbelievers
[1:48:33] having their position.
[1:48:36] Foolish visions
[1:48:38] having their position.
[1:48:41] Jewish having their position and us as
[1:48:45] well having our position.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Let's continue.
[1:48:58] Notice
[1:49:01] the millennium reign,
[1:49:05] the thousand years is not the new earth.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; The millennium reign
[1:49:12] is a different reign.
[1:49:14] That's what we go into.
[1:49:17] the millennium,
[1:49:19] but that is not the new earth
[1:49:27] or the new heaven.
[1:49:29] No, no,
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; that's just the rest place.
[1:49:34] See, the rest period,
[1:49:38] not all the new heaven and the new earth
[1:49:40] for you. See,
[1:49:43] in the millennium,
[1:49:45] we have things that will not go into
[1:49:49] that in the new heaven and the new
[1:49:53] earth. It's a time,
[1:49:57] old seventh day
[1:50:00] out at Eden.
[1:50:02] The seventh day after he made the world,
[1:50:06] the seventh day, he rested in Eden.
[1:50:10] and the millennium.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; So the millennium is just a rest day
[1:50:20] while we are in the jail.
[1:50:23] Don't be in hard.
[1:50:26] Amen.
[1:50:28] We are not expecting the rapture
[1:50:32] because we have many deps.
[1:50:39] We just need to pay our debt
[1:50:42] while we are going.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Don't be angry.
[1:50:48] When is this thing rapture coming?
[1:50:52] They shouldn't tire you. We should just
[1:50:55] pay it while waiting for the Lord
[1:50:57] because the Lord comes at the time that
[1:51:01] he will come.
[1:51:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; See, the world has now almost 6,000
[1:51:11] years.
[1:51:15] Every 2,000 years
[1:51:17] is a destruction.
[1:51:19] The first 2,000,
[1:51:21] the flood came
[1:51:24] and he baptized this world with water.
[1:51:27] The next 2,000 years,
[1:51:30] Jesus come to sanctify it and claim it,
[1:51:36] drop his blood upon it,
[1:51:39] call it his.
[1:51:42] Amen. All right. From where
[1:51:46] they spared him, that's where we came
[1:51:49] from. That's where we were born. Thank
[1:51:54] God because the Bible says the lamb was
[1:51:59] slain before the foundation.
[1:52:04] Meaning everything
[1:52:06] was done. This is just the moment
[1:52:10] of manifestation
[1:52:13] and that's it. That's why I'll keep on
[1:52:16] saying relax in the will of God is has
[1:52:21] done everything.
[1:52:23] He has done everything.
[1:52:26] Don't even try to say I want to try. I
[1:52:30] want to live right now.
[1:52:34] God has done it. If you are not a child
[1:52:36] of God, you will try and even go to
[1:52:39] hell.
[1:52:45] You know a prodigal son
[1:52:49] who just left the father's house.
[1:52:53] and go to the foreign land. But one of
[1:52:55] the days he remembered that I have a
[1:52:59] father. I need to go back to my father.
[1:53:03] I cannot continue eating with him. When
[1:53:06] the father sees him from far away, he
[1:53:10] said my son who was dead is alive. He
[1:53:15] embraced him.
[1:53:19] Amen.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. slaughter a cow and you know it
[1:53:23] was a feast day
[1:53:25] gave him a new robe.
[1:53:28] They say his elder brother was not happy
[1:53:30] about it.
[1:53:35] If a a a sinner,
[1:53:38] come to God.
[1:53:40] Heaven rejoice
[1:53:42] but others got angry. Check your spirit
[1:53:49] because that man said no. He took his
[1:53:53] portion
[1:53:55] and take it away
[1:53:57] and eat everything. I was remaining with
[1:54:00] you father. I'm responsible son.
[1:54:05] He is responsible. He is responsible.
[1:54:07] But the father said he is my son. You
[1:54:11] are my son. Everything in the house
[1:54:14] belongs to you.
[1:54:17] Everything in the father belongs to you.
[1:54:25] Everything in the house
[1:54:27] belongs to the
[1:54:31] wife
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; and the kids.
[1:54:35] I've seen disaster.
[1:54:38] I've seen disasters.
[1:54:40] When men died,
[1:54:43] you go to the wheel and check what's
[1:54:45] happening.
[1:54:49] You see in the wheel,
[1:54:52] a man put his mother
[1:54:57] and his siblings,
[1:54:59] the wife and the kids are not there.
[1:55:04] Come on.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, I've seen it.
[1:55:22] Why did you get married to begin with?
[1:55:27] And I'm asking a question again.
[1:55:30] How do you feel if one day you check the
[1:55:35] will of our Lord Jesus Christ? You are
[1:55:38] not there
[1:55:42] in the will of our Lord Jesus Christ. We
[1:55:46] see the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:51] So if you do such
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; who are you taking after
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; We let's just I always say but for sure
[1:56:04] by now you see I am a man who loves
[1:56:07] families
[1:56:10] I want to see peace in the families
[1:56:13] and the families living nice
[1:56:17] our kids nice.
[1:56:19] I'm not saying there will be no shouting
[1:56:22] in the house. We shouting and after
[1:56:25] shouting we laugh at the devil because
[1:56:29] the work of the devil, brother Benham
[1:56:32] says, is to torment the family.
[1:56:36] The devil doesn't like families
[1:56:39] fight in the families so happy. But I
[1:56:43] want to tell you, let's shame the devil.
[1:56:47] [Applause]
[1:56:53] I'll come again now as king with his
[1:56:57] queen and the second 2,000 years
[1:57:02] does he do? He comes and give his period
[1:57:07] and then
[1:57:09] bends her off
[1:57:13] and claim it for his own.
[1:57:16] put his own back on it.
[1:57:21] I I'm I'm always following
[1:57:24] this war on Russia and Ukraine
[1:57:29] America and
[1:57:32] you will realize that is true when
[1:57:35] brother Brennham says
[1:57:39] of the devil.
[1:57:41] I I was listening to Trump
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; saying to Zalinski,
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; "Yes, we sold weapon to you,
[1:57:51] but those weapons that
[1:57:55] don't throw them inside Russia,
[1:58:00] why did I buy to begin with?"
[1:58:05] Ukraine
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; spent billions
[1:58:09] to buy weapons.
[1:58:11] missiles and everything from America.
[1:58:15] But America said, "Don't use them. You
[1:58:19] will use them the day we tell you to
[1:58:24] sil
[1:58:26] this doesn't make sense.
[1:58:29] I throw." He throw one missile
[1:58:32] in Russia and blow their substation.
[1:58:36] [Music]
[1:58:37] Russia responded
[1:58:40] with more than 600 drone
[1:58:44] 1,000 people
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; in Ukraine
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; in one day.
[1:58:50] Then Trump came and say I told you
[1:58:56] that's politic.
[1:59:01] That is why
[1:59:04] when Russia speak
[1:59:07] is not threatening they do what they
[1:59:10] believe. I was listening
[1:59:14] to the minister of forign affairs of
[1:59:17] Russia.
[1:59:20] They call him Sergey Lavro something
[1:59:23] like that.
[1:59:26] He was interviewed by NBC journalist.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "You Russian,
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; you want to own the entire world.
[1:59:40] want to take all the territories.
[1:59:45] Then he responded to the journalist and
[1:59:47] said,
[1:59:49] "I wish you know, but you know nothing
[1:59:54] because
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Russia
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; used to be USSR,
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; USSR,
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Union Soviet Socialist Republic,
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; but we move from there.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; We are Russia.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Even Alaska
[2:00:10] you are boasting about
[2:00:13] was Russia.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Even Ukraine you are talking about was
[2:00:18] Russia
[2:00:20] and Russia
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; is the largest continent in the world.
[2:00:26] We just want to live in peace
[2:00:29] but if you touch us we will respond
[2:00:32] harshly.
[2:00:35] He said I was listening to him. He said
[2:00:38] the only thing
[2:00:40] that we need. We don't want to fight UK
[2:00:44] but the only thing we need because it's
[2:00:47] one of our land they must not
[2:00:52] our enemies if they accept our enemies
[2:00:56] we will deal with them harshly.
[2:01:01] Did you know that when Putin
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; was talking with Trump
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; in Alaska about peace, they were busy
[2:01:11] bombing Ukraine,
[2:01:14] but they were talking peace.
[2:01:16] Then the Bible said it's true. When they
[2:01:18] say peace, peace, destruction will come.
[2:01:24] Amen.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Brenham said during
[2:01:27] his time was
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; and they met couldn't agree. Do you know
[2:01:36] today Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; they met couldn't agree. America will
[2:01:44] never agree with Russia because the
[2:01:49] Bible says
[2:01:51] right at the end it's iron
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; and clay
[2:01:56] iron and clay is Russia and America they
[2:02:01] will never agree. That is why at the end
[2:02:05] third world war
[2:02:08] when the NATO tried to speak
[2:02:11] Putin is just say try you can talk but
[2:02:16] you try
[2:02:18] throw one missile
[2:02:22] I finished the whole world
[2:02:26] now that is true I'm saying that because
[2:02:29] here
[2:02:30] brother Brenham says last here and he
[2:02:34] burns her off
[2:02:37] this world. How he's going to burn it
[2:02:39] off. Those missiles from Russia.
[2:02:44] I was reading again
[2:02:47] this kind of missile
[2:02:51] they make.
[2:02:53] They say
[2:02:55] that missile does not need to hit the
[2:02:59] building.
[2:03:01] It just go up.
[2:03:03] When it comes down at a certain level,
[2:03:08] explode and on that explode
[2:03:12] is thousand and thousand more hotter
[2:03:15] than the sun.
[2:03:19] the people in that city,
[2:03:21] they just die.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; That's how they're going to finish this
[2:03:27] world.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; And it's going to happen.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; So, America
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; knows Russia is capable of that, but it
[2:03:37] need to be wiped off
[2:03:41] because the Bible says so. Let's
[2:03:44] continue. And notice
[2:03:47] not the perfect world. It's millennium.
[2:03:52] It's a type
[2:03:54] of the seventh day.
[2:03:56] There comes the white throne judgment.
[2:03:59] We still have judgment.
[2:04:02] It's still in time in the millennium.
[2:04:05] It's a day a thousand years. It's a time
[2:04:09] element.
[2:04:11] No, don't get that mixed up with the
[2:04:15] because it's not the new earth eternal
[2:04:20] but the millennium the day.
[2:04:25] Amen.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Notice seven days only has to do with
[2:04:32] the old creation.
[2:04:36] World time.
[2:04:37] Seven days is the millennium
[2:04:41] the rest day
[2:04:44] as God labored six days
[2:04:47] rested the seventh
[2:04:50] church labor six days
[2:04:52] and rest the seventh but you still in
[2:04:56] the time element I ain't speaking of the
[2:04:59] eternal
[2:05:01] but you see there's no such a thing as
[2:05:04] eight days.
[2:05:07] You go back
[2:05:10] to the first day again. See the first
[2:05:13] day. So the first day is a millennium.
[2:05:19] I mean the seventh day is the millennium
[2:05:23] where we rest. But the eighth day is the
[2:05:27] new earth. It's the new heaven.
[2:05:32] Amen.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; So if you can see yourself
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; in rapture,
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; then you will be in the millennium.
[2:05:45] After the millennium when the sin come
[2:05:48] again because we are still in time, you
[2:05:52] will be on the side of our Lord Jesus
[2:05:56] Christ. After death, you will go in the
[2:05:59] white throat judgment. You are not going
[2:06:02] to be just but you will be the judge.
[2:06:06] Then after that we go to the new
[2:06:09] Jerusalem and it's eternal.
[2:06:14] We are going there but now we in a
[2:06:18] millennia.
[2:06:20] The Sabbath speaks of the old law
[2:06:23] which was to pass away. The keeping of
[2:06:26] Sabbath which passed away or I have said
[2:06:31] or changed to another.
[2:06:33] Amen. It just changed from old law
[2:06:37] keeping a certain day
[2:06:41] of the week. That is the Sabbath, the
[2:06:44] day of rest. So if you rest for one day,
[2:06:48] the people trying to keep them following
[2:06:51] the Jewish, you know, tradition.
[2:06:55] But God has done our Sabbath as the
[2:06:59] millennium for a thousand years.
[2:07:04] He He loved us so much.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. For a thousand years,
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; we will be with him. But for 40 years,
[2:07:14] he was with the Jewish.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in the millennium
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; as we read Isaiah 65
[2:07:25] the Bible says we will build house
[2:07:29] and inhabit them.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. For a thousand years. Where did
[2:07:36] you ever find such things? Is because
[2:07:39] God is honoring us.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Let me read this again.
[2:07:45] Question and answers.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:48] God made the world in 6,000 years.
[2:07:54] 7,000
[2:07:58] he rested.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "Amen
[2:08:03] will never leave that time.
[2:08:08] The day you eat thereof,
[2:08:11] you shall die." That is why Adam
[2:08:15] couldn't me.
[2:08:20] lived 969 years.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; He never lived 2,000 years. But the man
[2:08:28] that's going to live through the
[2:08:29] millennium
[2:08:31] 1,000 years to show that the penalty
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; has been paid.
[2:08:39] Man lives forever.
[2:08:42] The day is finished. The time is
[2:08:45] finished. They are in eternity.
[2:08:48] All the things that happens in the new
[2:08:51] test in the Old Testament
[2:08:54] were leading to our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:08:58] The one that the Bible is talking about.
[2:09:01] He redeemed us. He made us who we are
[2:09:05] today. That is why he was supposed to
[2:09:08] die on the cross by his blood. All our
[2:09:12] sins are forgiven.
[2:09:17] Amen. Amen.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; If the Old Testament people
[2:09:22] failed, God himself came down and taste
[2:09:27] death out of death. Here we are this
[2:09:30] morning.
[2:09:32] [Applause]
[2:09:34] Amen.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; God
[2:09:38] loved David so much
[2:09:41] when he talks about the kings in Israel.
[2:09:45] the kings in Israel all of them. But he
[2:09:49] speak about David in a special way.
[2:09:53] Listen to this.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Solomon was the son of David.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Then God honored David
[2:10:04] bring millennium in Israel during the
[2:10:08] time of the son of David being Solomon
[2:10:12] naturally.
[2:10:14] Amen. Amen. And God again is honoring
[2:10:18] David in another millennium that will be
[2:10:23] ruled by the son of David being our Lord
[2:10:27] Jesus Christ.
[2:10:31] Amen. Amen. The millennium
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; for the Jewish was for the son of David.
[2:10:37] The millennium for the bride was for the
[2:10:40] son of David.
[2:10:42] So Jesus Christ is the spiritual son of
[2:10:45] David.
[2:10:46] Solomon, the physical son of David.
[2:10:51] God loved David so much.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; Now it's a question. If time seizes
[2:11:06] when the seals were open, if time sees
[2:11:11] when the seals were open, then the
[2:11:14] millennium is also finished. Is it not?
[2:11:18] It's a question
[2:11:20] answer and say no.
[2:11:24] Time didn't seize when the sins were
[2:11:27] open.
[2:11:29] Misunderstood it.
[2:11:32] Okay. What happened? The mysteries
[2:11:37] was revealed. Not time ceased.
[2:11:42] Just look.
[2:11:44] You know, brother was teaching us here
[2:11:48] that the sins was revealing something
[2:11:52] but was not stopping time. The time will
[2:11:55] go because now we are still on time.
[2:12:00] Rapture is time. Millennium is time. Gog
[2:12:05] and Magog is time. White throne
[2:12:09] judgment.
[2:12:11] Eternity is not time. So the seals came
[2:12:16] to reveal dead.
[2:12:18] But the time is going.
[2:12:20] Time never ceased
[2:12:23] until the post millennialist.
[2:12:28] Amen. Amen. After the millennium, that's
[2:12:31] when time
[2:12:33] will see but now still in time.
[2:12:38] Now the millennium is not the new
[2:12:41] heavens and the new earth
[2:12:44] will still be seen
[2:12:47] after the millennium.
[2:12:50] There will still be sin after the
[2:12:52] millennium.
[2:12:54] You know why you die sinner. You wake up
[2:12:59] sinner. You die a child of God. You wake
[2:13:04] up a child of God.
[2:13:07] You will see when we get to go and make
[2:13:11] the millennium.
[2:13:15] That time during the millennium
[2:13:21] by the chain of circumstance
[2:13:24] there was no one
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; to deceive.
[2:13:31] Then God will allow them to rise. When
[2:13:35] they rise they will try to fight you to
[2:13:40] fight Mik. that war of revelation 12
[2:13:46] amen comes again Lucifer his angel
[2:13:52] his angel they will fight again that's
[2:13:55] when he will wipe off all of them
[2:14:03] is time as
[2:14:05] amen so
[2:14:08] when you arrive
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; you will be rising like the way you are.
[2:14:14] You die a sinner, you wake up a sinner.
[2:14:17] You die a child of God, you will rise a
[2:14:19] child.
[2:14:24] I if you fight someone,
[2:14:27] he defeated you. Next time when you meet
[2:14:30] him and realizing that you won't win him
[2:14:34] again, he will surrender.
[2:14:37] But the devil and his angel when they
[2:14:40] rise again they forgot that is God who
[2:14:45] raised them. They will say you fought us
[2:14:48] last time. You defeated us but not this
[2:14:52] time.
[2:14:55] That's a blind man
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; and that will be the end of them.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:04] But Enoch,
[2:15:06] the translated one, was a type of the
[2:15:09] bride
[2:15:11] that went up, not the one that was
[2:15:14] carried over.
[2:15:16] So sin
[2:15:18] will still be on the other side of the
[2:15:21] millennium
[2:15:24] because sin is unbelief.
[2:15:27] The people even after death, they will
[2:15:31] disbelieve the word of God.
[2:15:33] because they were made to disbelieve.
[2:15:38] But not during the millennium.
[2:15:41] During the millennium is peace.
[2:15:46] During the time of Solomon
[2:15:49] was peace. During the time of the
[2:15:52] millennium will be peace. But still
[2:15:57] will be dealt with
[2:16:00] on the other side of the millennium and
[2:16:03] then time will fade.
[2:16:12] So you see we are in a journey.
[2:16:16] When you are a child of God, you for
[2:16:19] sure you know
[2:16:21] that you are a child of God to begin
[2:16:23] with
[2:16:24] a child of God today. You will be the
[2:16:27] child of God tomorrow and we are going
[2:16:29] to the new city you will be a child of
[2:16:32] God.
[2:16:34] That is why in the rapture
[2:16:38] when you get into the rapture or when
[2:16:41] you rapture being a child of God you are
[2:16:44] not you are quite sure that from here
[2:16:48] until eternity I will remain like this.
[2:16:58] Lord Jesus Christ is not like us because
[2:17:02] one day
[2:17:04] I attended a wedding
[2:17:07] young brother and a sister we agree on
[2:17:10] the marriage
[2:17:12] in the courtship they promising one
[2:17:14] another
[2:17:16] this and that and so forth. But the
[2:17:19] Friday evening
[2:17:21] when we get to the wedding
[2:17:24] they divorce each other already.
[2:17:27] But they said because we invited people,
[2:17:31] let them just come and eat, the pastor
[2:17:34] was there officiating
[2:17:37] false vow
[2:17:39] because they knew each other.
[2:17:42] Kiss the bride,
[2:17:47] Saturday evening.
[2:17:50] The other one goes there, the other goes
[2:17:51] there. I attended that wedding.
[2:17:56] learning how to live.
[2:17:58] [Music]
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Then I I I spoke with a brother.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; He's my friend. I said, "Bru, how did
[2:18:17] you manage to get this right?"
[2:18:20] [Music]
[2:18:21] He said, "I didn't have a choice.
[2:18:24] We disagree
[2:18:26] until we just say come eat and go home.
[2:18:31] And even this wife I'm I'm getting
[2:18:34] married to
[2:18:36] is taken this way
[2:18:38] taking this way. I'm not lying to you.
[2:18:42] It happened even today. They are not
[2:18:46] together
[2:18:47] since that day of the wedding. But
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; who are they taking after?
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; When Christ married us, irrespective
[2:19:00] of the condition that comes our way, he
[2:19:05] will never leave us.
[2:19:12] We have many reasons to leave our wives
[2:19:16] and not many reason to stay with them.
[2:19:23] If God can be angry and say, "I don't
[2:19:26] want you anymore. Can I be honest with
[2:19:29] you?"
[2:19:30] None of you here
[2:19:33] will survive. None of you. As long as
[2:19:38] you are still wearing this flesh, you
[2:19:40] will never survive. What makes us
[2:19:43] survive?
[2:19:45] The inner man. The man that is perfect
[2:19:49] is the one that God is looking at. But
[2:19:53] this one
[2:19:56] after
[2:19:59] service will go out here. Some will be
[2:20:01] griefed.
[2:20:04] But after hearing this message
[2:20:10] [Music]
[2:20:15] is the flesh.
[2:20:20] Amen.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; So now we we continue.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Does the millennium
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; have to do with the 1,000 years?
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; Could it not be a generation?
[2:20:36] Amen. Brother respond.
[2:20:41] A generation
[2:20:43] allotted in the Bible.
[2:20:47] 40 years.
[2:20:49] That's natural.
[2:20:52] The generation and that 40 years
[2:20:56] was the age
[2:20:59] allotted to Israel.
[2:21:02] But the Bible says
[2:21:05] and they lived and reigned with Christ,
[2:21:09] thousand years. It will be 1,000 years
[2:21:14] upon the earth. The millennium
[2:21:18] will be in this earth. Are we together?
[2:21:22] For we will build houses
[2:21:25] and inhabit them because 1,000 years
[2:21:30] upon the earth is only counted a time
[2:21:35] for a parallel parable like God as one
[2:21:39] day.
[2:21:41] 1,00 years upon on the earth is only one
[2:21:45] day with God as God concounting time.
[2:21:50] How many understand that? I believe
[2:21:53] children of God understand.
[2:21:55] So does the Sabbath day when the church
[2:21:58] will no more labor
[2:22:02] against sin?
[2:22:05] There's a time coming
[2:22:07] where will you will not labor
[2:22:10] against seed. But now we are laboring
[2:22:15] against sin. Come millennia, we will not
[2:22:19] labor against
[2:22:22] all of us. We believe one God,
[2:22:27] one accord.
[2:22:33] The church
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; might be as full as it is in this world,
[2:22:40] but it does not guarantee
[2:22:43] that will be all in the middle.
[2:22:46] For the Bible says, not all Israel
[2:22:51] wise, not all message believers.
[2:22:57] That is why God in our time is dealing
[2:23:00] with us individually.
[2:23:03] I don't care what you do. I just believe
[2:23:06] in God myself alone. If you have another
[2:23:10] idea is up to you.
[2:23:15] Not all the people that are in the
[2:23:18] message believe the message. Maybe you
[2:23:21] must not believe the message. Amen.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; Maybe you must not believe the message.
[2:23:26] must be the message.
[2:23:29] [Applause]
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; And Satan is binded for a little season,
[2:23:40] a thousand years
[2:23:44] because his subject
[2:23:47] is all in hell.
[2:23:49] The church
[2:23:51] that's on earth is redeemed
[2:23:55] and right in the the presence of Christ.
[2:23:59] So he has nothing he can work on.
[2:24:03] So it's not a chain
[2:24:06] as I said a lock chain
[2:24:09] it's a chain
[2:24:11] of circumstances
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; just waiting
[2:24:16] for the resurrection of the subject then
[2:24:20] they separated
[2:24:22] as sheep
[2:24:24] from the goat.
[2:24:26] You see we are in a journey. There will
[2:24:29] be a time where people will see will be
[2:24:33] separated
[2:24:35] a sheep from the goat.
[2:24:42] That is why in the message
[2:24:46] it's an individual thing.
[2:24:51] The people can make you hate other
[2:24:54] people. If you don't know your stand,
[2:24:58] you will hate.
[2:25:02] Now I repeat, I love until I love my
[2:25:06] enemies.
[2:25:08] If you hate me this morning, know that I
[2:25:10] love you.
[2:25:18] Then come David.
[2:25:20] He was going to reflect
[2:25:23] the the great millennium
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; in David. He was going to show what king
[2:25:30] was
[2:25:31] and God saw by David. Amen. Amen. He
[2:25:36] will rise up his son
[2:25:39] seat on the throne. And David was such a
[2:25:44] gallant man till he was a man after
[2:25:48] God's
[2:25:51] And David was doing good. He smoked
[2:25:56] all the Philistine
[2:25:59] tore down their altars
[2:26:02] to stay with the way. And finally the
[2:26:06] pretty woman upset him.
[2:26:10] He and he
[2:26:12] and he broke the commandment,
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; lost the weight.
[2:26:18] committed adultery.
[2:26:21] See a man after his own heart.
[2:26:27] Still David failed him.
[2:26:31] After David fail him, God look at David
[2:26:36] is a man after his own heart.
[2:26:40] God is not like us. If someone can fail
[2:26:45] you,
[2:26:51] It's because you are a human being. You
[2:26:54] are not like God. If someone has failed
[2:26:56] you, God look at what
[2:27:00] before he
[2:27:02] devil does not have access to the
[2:27:05] children of God anymore.
[2:27:11] Moses failed him. All the rest of them
[2:27:14] failed him. But all their lives
[2:27:18] were just reflection
[2:27:20] of the one that was to come.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; All those new old testament people they
[2:27:27] were failing him because they were human
[2:27:30] beings. But when Christ Jesus come, he
[2:27:33] was perfect. He wanted a perfect thing
[2:27:37] and we are the perfect bride of God.
[2:27:41] That's why when he come he said bride
[2:27:45] you are sinless. You are spotless. That
[2:27:49] is why when brother come he look at you
[2:27:54] and say I see you there.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; If brother Brennan says I see you there
[2:28:05] is a complete thing.
[2:28:08] What is happening? What is going on?
[2:28:11] Show us there.
[2:28:13] [Music]
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; A soldier in the battle will fight. If
[2:28:20] they shoot your foot, you fall down. You
[2:28:24] rise limp. Shoot the devil. Shoot the
[2:28:27] enemy.
[2:28:29] You don't fall and sleep.
[2:28:36] This thing of the message.
[2:28:39] The next thing
[2:28:45] But a soldier will keep on soldiering on
[2:28:49] a soldier will die having the sword in
[2:28:53] his hand.
[2:28:56] Brothers and sisters, never give up.
[2:29:02] [Applause]
[2:29:04] Keep on soldiering on.
[2:29:06] There's a crown for you.
[2:29:11] Let me read from Satan's Eden. Satan's
[2:29:15] Eden.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Remember here not long ago I was
[2:29:19] teaching you on the seven trumpets,
[2:29:24] the feast of the trumpet. Amen.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; And so forth. And I say there's a 8th
[2:29:30] day festival
[2:29:34] festival. Eighth day, first
[2:29:39] the seventh day will be the last that
[2:29:43] will be the millennium.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. The seventh day is the millennium.
[2:29:49] When you go to the eighth one, it's
[2:29:52] eternity. But there's eighth day
[2:29:55] festival.
[2:29:58] It was the eighth
[2:30:00] and there's only seven days.
[2:30:03] We'll make it the first day again.
[2:30:06] Come right back
[2:30:09] to the first day. Then after the
[2:30:12] millennium is over and there will be
[2:30:14] established Eden again.
[2:30:21] The millennium
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; is in Eden. God's great kingdom
[2:30:27] will be taken
[2:30:29] because Jesus because Jesus fought it
[2:30:33] out with Satan
[2:30:37] in the garden of heaven
[2:30:39] and won it back
[2:30:42] the
[2:30:43] which he's going to prepare
[2:30:46] in heaven to return again up in heaven.
[2:30:52] He said, "Let not your heart be
[2:30:56] troubled."
[2:30:59] If Eden,
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; that's where a man failed
[2:31:04] in Kaman. That's where a man conquer
[2:31:09] because our Lord Jesus Christ was
[2:31:11] hanging on the cross. that thinking is
[2:31:15] the end of him and this is the
[2:31:18] beginning.
[2:31:19] [Applause]
[2:31:19] [Music]
[2:31:21] That's where we were born. When he was
[2:31:24] crucified in Gethru by so doing he was
[2:31:29] taking us back
[2:31:32] where we failed. He was taking us back
[2:31:36] in the garden of Eden to show that our
[2:31:40] battle is his battle.
[2:31:43] We we we we can't help ourselves. We
[2:31:47] can't defeat the devil. The only time we
[2:31:50] can defeat him is to accept what
[2:31:54] happened in man.
[2:31:58] Try yourself.
[2:32:00] You failed.
[2:32:02] Don't Don't try to fight physical war.
[2:32:08] Don't try to say this person has done
[2:32:12] this this
[2:32:15] and try physically.
[2:32:18] You will fail. But if you try it, we
[2:32:22] know that you are a serpent seat.
[2:32:26] They fight physically.
[2:32:33] The only seat that fight physically
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; is the serpent seat.
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; And we know that the history is closing
[2:32:49] out.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; The world history will be soon over.
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; Then we're going to step into a new day.
[2:33:02] Great millennium.
[2:33:03] That's as one believer
[2:33:06] in a millennium, a millennium reign with
[2:33:10] Christ,
[2:33:11] thousand years upon the earth. That is
[2:33:15] the physical return of the Lord Jesus
[2:33:21] to take a physical people
[2:33:25] glorified
[2:33:27] by his cleansing blood. Amen.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; That's where you know him. That's where
[2:33:34] you see him.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But in the millennium in the
[2:33:40] physical return
[2:33:42] of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; you are is no longer in him.
[2:33:48] He's no longer in us. He's with us. We
[2:33:53] see him. Then we talk, we respond. He
[2:33:57] talk to us, we respond. where in the
[2:34:01] millennia
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; his physical being
[2:34:06] was raised up to the throne of God where
[2:34:10] the spirit was on the throne.
[2:34:14] Now Christ is on the throne.
[2:34:18] Jesus a little while and the world see
[2:34:22] me no more
[2:34:25] yet you shall see
[2:34:27] for I'll be with you to the end of the
[2:34:31] world
[2:34:33] in you
[2:34:36] the throne of of God of Christ is
[2:34:40] erected in your heart in your heart is
[2:34:46] the throne of God and He sat him on
[2:34:49] God's throne. But in the millennia,
[2:34:54] Amen. He set his own throne.
[2:34:58] No longer in your heart, his own throne
[2:35:02] separate. You will be there. He saw that
[2:35:06] he will raise up a man. His son, David's
[2:35:10] son, sat on his throne.
[2:35:14] I'm one man who just accept
[2:35:18] things the way they are, things the way
[2:35:21] they go.
[2:35:24] All
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; don't try to fold your arms.
[2:35:32] No.
[2:35:35] Amen.
[2:35:41] Amen.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; A child of God, if he's in a position
[2:35:46] that he doesn't like, he will show God,
[2:35:50] you know better.
[2:35:52] You know it all. We are soldiering all.
[2:35:56] Let me just be honest with you. This
[2:35:59] the devil, Satan himself does not like
[2:36:03] this church.
[2:36:05] This church,
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; the devil hate it.
[2:36:09] You know why? When we say the throne of
[2:36:13] God, we are referring to you.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; Now, how can he hate love you? He must
[2:36:22] hate you. He He want to see us,
[2:36:25] fighting, going this way and that way.
[2:36:30] But the mature child of God will say
[2:36:33] come what may.
[2:36:37] We will never leave the word of God. The
[2:36:41] day I die, God knows. The day I'm in the
[2:36:45] rapture, God knows. God knows everything
[2:36:49] about us. Now tell me, why are you
[2:36:52] worrying this morning? Why do you have a
[2:36:54] long face this morning? What's the
[2:36:56] problem with you?
[2:36:59] Come on.
[2:37:04] Let me just stop here.
[2:37:07] God bless you.
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; Let's sing unto the Lord.
[2:37:24] [Music]
[2:37:38] [Music]
[2:37:44] [Applause]
[2:37:52] [Music]
[2:37:56] could not do.

[2:40:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you.

[2:43:07] Father God, that
[2:43:09] you increase our faith.

[2:43:15] things were going astray, you said to
[2:43:17] Peter, "Do you love me?
[2:43:21] If you do, strengthen your brothers."
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; Help us, Father God.
[2:43:28] This flesh
[2:43:30] is after its own Lord, Father God, the
[2:43:35] man inside us.

[2:43:42] says, "Don't look at me. Look at me

[2:44:21] God, because
[2:44:23] this flesh is cursed.
[2:44:26] What you are interested is is yourself
[2:44:30] through the blood.
[2:44:34] We want to pray once again. We thank you
[2:44:38] for having raised a man. Amen. In the
[2:44:42] name of Israel,
[2:44:46] our pastor years back when he toiled and
[2:44:51] God, you put in him the thirst of

[2:45:00] Thank you Jehovah. Father, we come to
[2:45:03] you once again. We believe in you. Bless
[2:45:06] the message that the brother has
[2:45:08] preached. Bless him. to strengthen him.

[2:45:25] you. Thank you, Jehovah.
