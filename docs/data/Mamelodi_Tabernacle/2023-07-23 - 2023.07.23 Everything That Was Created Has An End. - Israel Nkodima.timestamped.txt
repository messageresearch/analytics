[24:52] let him that is a first come and
[24:55] whosoever will let him take the Waters
[24:58] of Life free
[25:01] [Music]
[25:06] [Music]
[25:08] amen
[25:36] ah it's good to be here
[25:39] by God's
[25:41] Grace
[25:44] oh
[25:47] I'm going to read from the book here
[25:55] it's mine Church age
[26:00] page 2 11 2 11.
[26:04] and
[26:07] let's just start with
[26:10] 130
[26:16] yeah let's read the whole paragraphs
[26:23] but I will
[26:26] uh
[26:28] read up to this party yeah
[26:33] and
[26:36] where it says anything
[26:41] that head
[26:43] beginning yes
[26:50] okay I mean
[26:52] now usually
[26:54] you will read for me amen rather from
[26:58] paragraph 180. draw more paragraph 130
[27:02] is it 180 yes let us read the whole
[27:05] paragraph Here Comes
[27:09] amen and the blood test
[27:13] shows whether you are gods or not see
[27:18] your God's children and you have eternal
[27:21] life but the soul that sinneth that Soul
[27:25] shall be separated is that right then it
[27:28] will be no more now look anything that
[27:32] had a beginning has an end
[27:35] because anything that had a beginning is
[27:38] a creation but God was not created he
[27:42] was always God and there's no place he
[27:45] was created and the only way that we can
[27:48] ever have eternal life is to be part of
[27:51] that creation Glory or if we could see
[27:55] it see what the Holy Ghost does for you
[27:58] is is the Holy Ghost the Creator himself
[28:02] God the father in the form of a spirit
[28:05] called the Holy Ghost because it was
[28:08] upon the body called Jesus his son that
[28:12] he created Jesus the body that's the
[28:14] reason it had to die God dwelt in this
[28:18] human flesh and the blood cell was broke
[28:21] and the life and the blood cell come
[28:23] back amen
[28:25] amen amen
[28:28] so I'm going to reach some few things
[28:32] actually the brothers asked me to remove
[28:35] this lose part here amen
[28:40] okay yeah but tomorrow will be uh fixing
[28:45] it
[28:46] the dentist or dentisting okay you saw
[28:50] you are glad to be here
[28:56] firstly
[28:58] I'm going to dwell on this
[29:01] everything that was created
[29:12] talking about creation
[29:15] how are you their daughter
[29:22] you come and see me
[29:26] in the office there okay
[29:32] should I remove it
[29:36] all right it will it will get off by
[29:39] itself
[29:41] everything
[29:46] is
[29:52] and yet you read God created heaven and
[29:55] earth
[29:57] then the same scripture tells you that
[30:00] is
[30:05] Heaven and Earth
[30:07] shall pass away
[30:10] I mean and yet God created
[30:16] but they shall pass away
[30:19] what will remain
[30:21] that was not created
[30:29] I believe we'll be seriously
[30:33] and see who we are and where we are
[30:47] blessed are they who read these books
[30:52] you are blessed
[30:55] you don't just become a follower of the
[30:58] message
[30:59] but you become the message
[31:09] I want to read this party
[31:13] it says
[31:15] we
[31:47] [Music]
[32:01] and outside
[32:04] amen amen uh they they think we we are
[32:09] crazy
[32:11] that's right but we who are in here
[32:16] in Christ so he's talking from the
[32:19] inside
[32:22] baptized into him
[32:30] that are in here
[32:33] in Christ
[32:35] preaching from them
[32:39] because if you are outside
[32:41] you will preach the things of outside
[32:44] but if you are inside you'll bring the
[32:48] word from the initiality
[32:51] and that's the difference
[32:54] that's why friends
[32:56] you see I don't hate anybody
[33:01] even if my brother don't understand
[33:05] like myself
[33:07] I won't say anything against that
[33:12] it is
[33:14] predestinated
[33:16] I thank God for what he made me trust me
[33:21] if somebody is not like me
[33:25] I won't criticize
[33:28] amen amen because me also I thank God
[33:33] for what he has made me
[33:37] that's all ah man
[33:43] the unveiling of God
[33:46] okay I mean
[33:49] um it says we are still veiled to them
[33:53] outside us
[33:56] because we have insiders
[34:02] they like an Outsiders
[34:07] is an impersonator
[34:09] [Music]
[34:12] there's so much impersonation today
[34:18] of The Outsiders
[34:21] who will listen to the Insiders
[34:26] and take the word a challenge preached
[34:30] by the Insiders
[34:35] they haven't received that word
[34:39] is yes
[34:43] [Music]
[34:51] all right
[34:54] you understand that now let me read here
[35:01] we are still veiled
[35:06] [Music]
[35:08] and
[35:11] let me pass yes
[35:14] [Applause]
[35:16] it says
[35:20] who
[35:22] so now we are invited into him remember
[35:30] to be partakers
[35:33] of all that he is
[35:40] we are invited into him remember
[35:43] which is hit to unbelievers what
[35:51] what amen now I want you to take note of
[35:54] this is
[35:59] to be partakers
[36:03] of all that
[36:06] he is
[36:09] because Paul says I preach him
[36:16] and him crucified
[36:18] that's why we we are here to preach him
[36:24] amen
[36:26] now listen to this
[36:31] we are invited
[36:38] to be no you we don't invite you to to
[36:42] church
[36:44] the way that we preach
[36:47] it's an invitation to be invited into
[36:53] um
[36:54] [Applause]
[36:56] I'm in
[36:58] to be
[37:00] particles
[37:03] of all that she is
[37:05] [Applause]
[37:08] not of all that he says
[37:12] of all that he is
[37:19] because
[37:26] we preach him
[37:30] call him and him crucified
[37:36] so I read yeah
[37:40] they know the glory
[37:42] they read of it
[37:46] is
[37:50] the glory of God
[37:52] I mean don't be surprised
[37:58] the why God is going to judge the people
[38:03] it is because after they have seen that
[38:06] is
[38:14] knowing exactly that this is the word of
[38:17] God
[38:20] hearing
[38:24] so now
[38:27] I'll turn to this one
[38:32] so now we are invited into him usually
[38:36] remember yeah
[38:39] it is no more all right all right all
[38:42] right amen that we're talking about the
[38:45] glory of God
[38:48] to them is just a word
[38:55] you know like to you if it is just the
[38:58] way
[39:00] and you even talk about it
[39:02] you preach but it's just the way
[39:08] you see the difference here
[39:10] the prophet is talking here
[39:14] now and
[39:16] things like that just a worthy to them
[39:21] but to us it's a manifestation
[39:27] now you've got to see between the weight
[39:30] and the manifestation
[39:36] foreign
[39:43] [Music]
[40:02] and then
[40:04] age
[40:11] that was the way
[40:14] so if you say we are going to preach
[40:18] this way we will continue to say yes
[40:30] age
[40:42] is that right now
[41:00] see what I mean
[41:03] that's why Paul says I'll teach him
[41:11] then it continues now we see him
[41:17] amen
[41:37] [Applause]
[41:40] all right amen that's what we are
[41:43] looking at
[41:48] [Music]
[41:56] but what about you
[41:58] yeah are you the manifestation

[1:11:13] I mean because
[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:19] all that God created
[1:11:21] your body my body
[1:11:27] did you know that my body has
[1:11:33] right I mean
[1:11:35] I will read you something here
[1:11:38] now listen it says anything that
[1:11:42] is
[1:11:48] because anything that had a beginning
[1:11:53] is a creation
[1:11:57] amen
[1:11:59] but God was not created at all now the
[1:12:05] prophet of God says
[1:12:08] you were in him
[1:12:11] in his mind
[1:12:14] now his mind is not a creation
[1:12:19] it's him yeah amen
[1:12:23] so
[1:12:25] he was he was a us
[1:12:29] we were like him in him
[1:12:37] now that's why today when the wait comes
[1:12:41] to this one is just the way
[1:12:44] but to us it becomes amazing station
[1:12:49] [Applause]
[1:12:54] I'm talking about two you look at the
[1:12:57] two Beginnings
[1:12:59] in the beginning was the way the way it
[1:13:04] was with God
[1:13:09] you see I mean then it comes again
[1:13:13] in the beginning God created
[1:13:18] the Earth the Heaven and the earth
[1:13:21] now that is creation
[1:13:27] it is
[1:14:00] my spirit and your spirit
[1:14:02] was not created
[1:14:06] I mean
[1:14:07] but was process is no process because
[1:14:12] you do you have that book Hebrews
[1:14:17] spoken word Hebrews
[1:14:19] I mean foreign
[1:14:58] but that's not good
[1:15:01] if you read without any manifestation
[1:15:09] manifestation means
[1:15:12] if I read
[1:15:15] the word
[1:15:18] that word is manifested
[1:15:28] boss
[1:15:30] then usually the prophet says it isn't
[1:15:35] just a written way
[1:15:38] to us
[1:15:41] it's a reality
[1:15:46] you know some people read some books
[1:15:49] he can even show you
[1:15:53] hey this man can reach you yeah
[1:15:58] underlining everything
