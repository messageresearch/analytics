Let's open the our Bibles. uh the book of um we start by Luke 17 verse 26-3 &gt;&gt; verse 26-30 &gt;&gt; verse 26-30 &gt;&gt; then we're going to read the book of John chap 1 &gt;&gt; verse 1-2 and verse 14 verse 1 to 3 and verse 14 &gt;&gt; verse one verse 14. &gt;&gt; Let's start with Luke 17:26 and Luke chapter 17 26. And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. &gt;&gt; Likewise also, as it was in the days of Lord, they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded. But the same day that Lord went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read John 1 verse one to three and verse 14. 1 2 3 and 14. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 14. And the word was made flesh and dwell among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's close our eyes as we pray. Dear heavenly father, standing in front of your children in your place humbly coming into you into thy presence with my brother here. We are asking that you use our voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. to convey your message to your children. We are asking this in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may take your seats. I said going to have this topic. You know it. You are used to it. is the revelation of the son of man. Um that is a topic we are going to share with you but I would like the them to flash my sketch on the screen there. Looking at the sketch there. As the Bible has said, &gt;&gt; in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. If you are reading the scripture, it seems as if it is the word am God. Because they say it was the word and the word was with God and then they said the word was God. Then when we are looking there, the prophet says and we can read it like this. He said you can say in the beginning was the logos because the word is the logos and the logos &gt;&gt; is the theophony theophony. Then we can say in the beginning was theophony. Then if we want to know what is that theophony that theophony is formed, &gt;&gt; it is not formed out of but it is formed by Amen. &gt;&gt; the seven colors. of a fountain &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't say it is formed out. If you can say it is formed out mean as if it has come out. The whole all all those seven colors it it it came together when they came together they formed that locos that word that are you together with me in the beginning when we read Genesis they Hey, let's read my brother. Genesis chapter one. Genesis chapter 1 &gt;&gt; verse 1 to 2 only. &gt;&gt; Verse one to two. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, &gt;&gt; that spirit which was hoovering above the waters, it was the spirit of seven colors. That's why they call it a fountain. of of God &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; When you talk about the fountain, &gt;&gt; it's just like when you say you are going to the fountain of water is where the water is coming out of a rock of somewhere. You don't know where does that water come from. they just come. That's why we say it's a fountain because it doesn't have a beginning and ending. He's a fountain of God. It's a fountain of spirit. That's why the Bible says God is seven spirit. It doesn't mean that God has seven spirit. It means when God is using his spirit, he's used his spirit seven times. He's his spirit here and here and here until it seven then we say is seven spirit but it's one spirit. when it is used seven times that's why you call it the fountain of seven when they came together when those seven colors came together and they formed what we call the word which is a theophony which is the body &gt;&gt; of God wanted to come to a place where he can be seen. Somewhere where we can have an idea, where we can have an idea who what God is. Let me just read something here. He says here, &gt;&gt; it was the the god that went out. Amen. &gt;&gt; The the human form &gt;&gt; that that didn't have eyes like you see a better eye. But that all this rainbow condescended into a theophony. Moses saw it when it passed through the rock. He saw the back part. He saw the back part. It looked like a man. Abraham saw him when he stepped down into flesh. But before Abraham saw him, when he stepped down into flesh, Abraham he met him and he was calling himself has no father and mothered has no beginning and ending. It was that it was that form of God. It was God. That is what Abraham meant. He met God. Then one day when he was there at at this place he saw three men coming. He first of all he saw three balls of fire came down. Out of that came three men out. That is God. God just made just took dust there and make a booty. And he said, "Gabriel, get inside." They said, "Mega, get inside that one." And he get into another one. It was God himself in flesh. [Applause] Abraham Abraham met God in flesh. If men were passing there, they would say, "We have seen Abraham there with another man talking not knowing that they have seen God there. It was God in flesh. When Abraham as mec was God in a but when God was there in the house of Abraham he was God in flesh after he after after after he had finished his talking with Abraham then he finished he went back to the Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says here &gt;&gt; in the days when the son of man will be revealed, it will be like in the days of Sodom. In other words, it will be the same. But let let me go on back to what I'm saying there. Let let's flesh our when we read John &gt;&gt; it says that weight &gt;&gt; which is the theophony &gt;&gt; which is the logos &gt;&gt; which is Christ &gt;&gt; which is the angel of the covenant &gt;&gt; because in Malachia &gt;&gt; chapter 3 chapter three &gt;&gt; it says the Lord you are looking for will suddenly come to his temple. He says that Lord is the angel of the covenant. &gt;&gt; That is that theophony. Then when he come the Bible says here that word that theophony that logos became flesh. Amen. In other words, it it came into a flesh. It was the fulfillment of Malachi chapter 3. That's your funny that that that the Lord they were looking for will soon come to his temple. The Lord they were looking for came into his temple and he was called Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was God in flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why people didn't understand him. He said if you don't believe that I am him then you die in your sins. It was God in flesh. He said lady your many sins are forgiven. The Pharisees said he can forgive sins being a man. He say they don't understand. Even some of your disciples they didn't understand him. He say show us your father. He said Phillip if you know me you know my father. If you have seen me, you've seen my father. That's why people when he says when you come to you cannot come to my father except by me. They think he is here. The father is there and the son is here. Then when you come to the father, you must go to the son and the son must take you and to the father. But he said the lord you are looking for is in me. In other words because the god is in him. You cannot go to god beside going to him. When you go to God, you go to him. [Applause] That's why they didn't believe that. They couldn't comprehend it. But we know this man is the son of Mary and Jesus. We know how he was born. Why he's God man? the the the thing that that that I don't like about this man, &gt;&gt; he says he's God &gt;&gt; when he's a man. &gt;&gt; They said what is this? What should they do? &gt;&gt; It doesn't work. Okay, it's &gt;&gt; all right. When when we look here, &gt;&gt; he said he was the son of man. &gt;&gt; The weight in flesh is the son of man. &gt;&gt; Did you believe that? He said, "In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word of the word was God." &gt;&gt; I want you to believe. I I want you, you believers. But if you will just not look to me, but believe I believe that what the man said is the scripture. I don't know as we are as far as far up in the time he says we are but if it is then is got to happen. If his way are God's way then his ways will not fail. But God is God's word. Because he is the word. He says here, I believe that a man said in this scripture, if it is then if his ways are God's ways, they will never fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, God is the word. &gt;&gt; When we say he is the son of man, &gt;&gt; the son of man here, &gt;&gt; it was the word made flesh because he said, "Who do people say I, the son of man, am? Peter said, "Thou art Christ, the son of the living God." &gt;&gt; Peter was given another eye which which could look beyond the flesh because the word was in flesh. Then Peter could see inside the flesh that there is God there. Then he said that thou art Christ. He said Peter it's not because of your eyes. It is another eye and this is not yours. You were given that one to see. Who am I? Is not your eyes. Your eyes cannot see that. It is another eye which we call the revelation could see through the flesh. See inside there. But this is not only a man but is the word made flesh. In other words, &gt;&gt; all those all those seven spirits, all those seven colors have come together and formed that theophony. Then it was God in flesh. Let me see if I can see something here &gt;&gt; in this book Hebrews. Let me read something here. I read in the middle there. When I read it above there, he says he become from spirit. He became from spirit the great fountain of rainbow who had no beginning or no end. Then when I read down there the next he said next followed after that was another color to the seven perfect colors which is the seven spirits of God that went from that great fountain, &gt;&gt; that great diamond At the end there in that paragraph he says that whole big rainbow had become in a theophony and made in the image of man. That is what he's saying here. But let me read another one here. He says here it is the same type of a body that we receive when we die here. If this tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting. That was it. That was the theophony which was the son of God. That son, that logos became flesh because we were put in flesh and theophony the logos became flesh here among us. It was it was nothing else but the dwelling place &gt;&gt; for the entire fountain. Amen. Dwelt in him where in a man called Jesus. In that man dwell the whole fountain of seven colors dwell in that man. He was the son of man. Hallelujah. When you see that it was the full fountain coming together and they were in that man called the son of man. The prophet says it was the full seat. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said it was in the morning here. There it was in the afternoon. He says when those seven colors unfolded themselves, they formed seven church ages. Because here &gt;&gt; at Pentecost, &gt;&gt; the prophet says it was that same pillar of fire which divided itself into all those people who were there. If one of them receive part of it, when they are together, they form that great pillar of fire. But when here during seven church ages when it comes in the gentile times that seven that great that great body that which was formed by those seven colors those seven colors unfolded themselves don't forget they came together when they came together they formed that Theophony. But when they unfolded themselves again now, they formed seven church ages. Each church ages was parting up. Amen. And during that time, it was when he was building his own church. He said, "I will build my church. No one will build it for me." He used seven spirits in seven men in in seven men. We are called seven messengers. That's why the prophet says they were making God known to people each age. If you want to know God, you must see him. You must be introduced to him by those seven messengers. Without those seven messengers, there is no knowledge of God because they were the ones who were introducing God. They were the ones who were made making God known. They were little lights. In that age, your message was the full Holy Spirit. If you have received the message, you had the Holy Spirit. You were you were complete. Amen. You lack nothing. If you have received the message of the messenger particular age you were complete because when that's why now we living in another dispensation each dispensation God has loaded a weight for that particular dispensation because there are predestinated people who those words are loed to when that word come they receive it because it is loaded to them. It is sent to them and they will never miss it. is impossible to for them to miss it because it is for them. When God was wrote in these seven churches when God was each age has got a messenger and under that messenger there were shepherds there under those shepherds there were congregations there. They were already loed there. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I believe if you are a pastor from God you wereed when the when brotherham was slaughtered you you are also there. Amen to come under that message and if you believe the message from your pastor it means you areed under that pastor. [Applause] Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; There is no sheep &gt;&gt; without the shepherd. &gt;&gt; A sheep without a shepherd is a lost sheep. Living the Lord [Applause] is a goat with a sheep skin. [Applause] God has predestinated these things. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is each age until you get to Martin Luther &gt;&gt; because during that age that seat died there and he started to rise in the fourth church age. And in the in in the fifth church is added to germinate. Then we say &gt;&gt; that message there. &gt;&gt; It was the the just live by faith. It was a complete mess for that age. But God was building his church. But for that age it was a complete message. Those who those who lived by faith they were complete. They will be they will together with us when we are raptured. They will be part of the rapture also. That's why they waiting for us. That is we are living in the fullness of time. We are living people in the olden days wished to live in this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says they saw them coming. They saw these things coming and they long. But you are living in this age. and you play with this message. [Music] &gt;&gt; All right, let's just go. They go on. Each age has got that particular weight for that age. But during that seven church age, the prophet says it was a dispensation of the son of God. &gt;&gt; Because here it was a dispensation of the son of man. Amen. Then during the seven church age, it was a dispens of the son of God. It is where Zachariah says there will come a day where it will never be night or a day. It was during seven church ages. It was the Holy Ghost building his church. The Holy Ghost here. It was like a rain because there were there were seeds here which needs rain. They so that they can grow to maturity. But at the end there at the end there we we go back to a seat again. When when we have arrived &gt;&gt; to the seat again, &gt;&gt; we no more need the rain. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's another dispensation because what we were looking for, we have arrived. The s has arrived to what he sowed. The seed he has sown, it has it has come back again. If it is a seed again, it means it is the son of man again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because here he was a complete seed. We were all in him. All the ages were in him. All the messengers were in him. You were in him. He wanted to manifest you. Beautiful. Amen. Love it. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says he became flesh. &gt;&gt; Because we were flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We bypassed our theophanes because of sin. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We came to be flesh. &gt;&gt; He wanted to take us back to our theophies again, he must be in flesh so that he can come to us to lift us. Amen. To go back to where we were, you were there in the beginning. That's why the prophet says if you are not there, you will never be there. Amen. You will be there if you were there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then in the evening time, let me say this, he was the Holy Spirit during seven church age at the end of the seven church age. Bible says, the prophet says the messenger of each age comes at the end of the age to call people out of this age. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the seventh angel messenger came at the end. &gt;&gt; Then that's why the Bible says now he came when he came &gt;&gt; to Abraham He came in a form of &gt;&gt; of men being a man eating &gt;&gt; with them man. And he said at the end when the son of man is revealed it will be like that. In other words, &gt;&gt; it will be a man in flesh eating. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there must be Abraham and Sarah because this message of this man Elohim was meant to go to Sarah. It must do something. in &gt;&gt; when when it comes to there. &gt;&gt; That's why in the evening time there shall be light. The prophet says, "When those at the end there, those seven colors will come together again." And when they come together again, they will form what that again. When these seven colors come together again, they form that theophony and we call it the headstone because it is formed is Christ again. &gt;&gt; The head stone. The prophet says, "I am not the son of man. I am a son of man. The son of man revealed himself through a man. That's why the Bible says just like in Abra no Abraham's days a man came there it amen. A man must come in this dispensation and eat. But if it's a man eating, it must be God in that man. The Bible says so. It will be like that when the son of man is revealed again. We must look for a man. But it must be God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, if we don't see that, &gt;&gt; he says here in this book, the seed of discrepancy, let me read page 92. Now, tonight, but let me before I read this one, but let me read this one before I read this one. Because when those seven colors come together, they form that theophony. Again, &gt;&gt; are you together with me? &gt;&gt; It says here, &gt;&gt; in the beginning, &gt;&gt; this is CO 339. &gt;&gt; We'll go back to our Hebrew teaching just a a few men was this great big fountain of seven colors. How many knows that? And how many knows that God has seven spirits? Absolutely. seven spirits and there were seven eyes in the lamb and so forth all that coming together now. Amen. All those seven colors are coming together now. Now tonight in the days when we got this great discrepancy of discrepancy &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ promise in Luke &gt;&gt; in the book of the trumpets. He says h Jesus was reading the same scripture Genesis chapter 18 when he says when the son of man is revealed it like in the days of Sodom he was reading the same scripture he was saying it there will come a man but being God in flesh [Music] Now tonight in the days when we got this great discrepancy, [Music] Jesus Christ promised in Luke that in the days in the days before the coming of the Lord be like it was in the days of Saul. When the son of man would reveal himself like the son of man revealed himself to Abraham down there Elohim Elohim he will reveal himself again as in the evening time like like there Elohim that is what the prophecy God made flesh among people embedded there with Abraham and showed him and told him what Sarah was thinking in the tent. And he had never seen and called her name Sarah, &gt;&gt; not Sarai. Sarai. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In in in this here more &gt;&gt; what is that thing here? &gt;&gt; We see the same thing. &gt;&gt; God coming together. That's why we say &gt;&gt; here down there God revealed himself in man. &gt;&gt; The word was made flesh. &gt;&gt; There the word came flesh. &gt;&gt; But it's not the flesh like this one here. This one was born of man and woman. But God, it it pleased God to choose this man, the son of Ella and Richard Brenham. pleased God to choose this man that he is going to dwell in him. The full path, the full the fullness of God dwell in him because God himself revealed himself. All right. Amen. The prophet says, "What pl what blinded Israel back then? It was amen. Amen. And what is blending gentiles here is amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The same thing blended Israel there. The same thing is blended the Gentiles. [Applause] That's why after seven church we say no more rain is another dispensation when people say you'll forget you'll forgive me when they say come and receive the Holy Spirit we want to know what do they mean when they say come and receive the Holy Spirit Because the prophecies this time here there is is is another time the anointing there is the pillar of. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not receiving gifts. We are receiving the the giver of the gifts. [Applause] What is happening here is not happen here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because here they were receiving gifts but we are not receiving gifts. We are receiving the gift of the gifts. The prophet says the anointing there is the anointing of the pillar of fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is what is happening. That's why he says when he took the book, &gt;&gt; he left his editorial seat. He is no more a mediator. If you believe he has taken the book, then you believe that is nor. If you you you don't believe that he still your mediator because if if he stood up there, he took the book and we believe that he has taken the book and he opened the seats and he has given them to the seven angel messenger to reveal them and he has revealed them to us and he said this is the secret &gt;&gt; just like Elohim Abraham &gt;&gt; I'm coming &gt;&gt; have a son this one says this is the secret the weight is in the bread &gt;&gt; is a secret the living That's why when we are here we are eating. &gt;&gt; That is what the prophet says. &gt;&gt; What what do we eating? We are feeding on the ba body weight of the son of man. He is the hidden man. He is the carcass that the eagles are feeding on. Only the eagles but not crawls and vultures. But only the eagles are feeding. Why are they feeding here? They are feeding here because they are about to fly because this cacas will give them power to fly. [Music] [Applause] [Music] May you together with me &gt;&gt; when we here &gt;&gt; when he sinned &gt;&gt; in in the garden of he was driven out through the eastern gate. They put cherabs to guard the way the tree of life. Cherabs were there with a sword. &gt;&gt; 1963 1963 the prophet &gt;&gt; received a sword in his hand when it is revealed to him. They say it is the way in your hand. In the place of the cherubims, there was a man there. It will never be any other man beside the son of man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who must get into that gap? to close that gap because it was the place of man. It is taken by the cherubim waiting for man to come back to take his position. That's why now we are marching towards the tree of life. Amen. Because now the sword is leading us not back through. If you come here and you miss you go back then you'll wonder what happened in history. What's happening? &gt;&gt; You mean there is no more mediator? I know the power of God, the Holy Spirit moving &gt;&gt; because you have fallen back. &gt;&gt; Now your eyes are blinded. &gt;&gt; You can no more see. Even if they can preach and prove by spoken word, you will never see &gt;&gt; when when they arrived here. &gt;&gt; We have now we have arrived at the gate, &gt;&gt; the eastern gate. That's why we shall come back and talk about what is happening in Israel there because after Elohim has spoken to Abraham and Sarah. He vanished. That is what happened to us. And what is happening after that? What happened? their bodies changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; But what changed their bodies? It was the word which was spoken and received. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when God speaks the word, if it is the purpose of God, nothing will stop it. If God says this is the cigarette, the word is in the bread. Nothing will stop that. The word is in the bread. If it is not in you, it means you are not part of it. And that weight that's why we fit we feed on the body weight. He said they said store the food. This is the commission to the prophet and he told that man will rise all these spoken words man will rise pick up the nugget out of those spoken words to feed because out of the spoken way there are hidden mana there you must pick them up and feed God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother, will you stand up and pray and thank this message? and lose this service. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Bless you. &gt;&gt; Can we bow our heads? and open up our hearts &gt;&gt; after with great word &gt;&gt; that came from eternity &gt;&gt; the spoken word &gt;&gt; which is the original seed Lord &gt;&gt; once again &gt;&gt; we have reached the capstone &gt;&gt; we have reached &gt;&gt; that white stone &gt;&gt; the ministry of the son of man &gt;&gt; when God said let us make man in our own image. &gt;&gt; Man lost his godship &gt;&gt; in the Garden of Eden &gt;&gt; and cherabins were put there with a flaming sword. &gt;&gt; The seventh man in this last days &gt;&gt; on Sabino Canyon. &gt;&gt; It was the footprints &gt;&gt; on the sense of time. &gt;&gt; God once again &gt;&gt; heaven and earth have come together.

Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
