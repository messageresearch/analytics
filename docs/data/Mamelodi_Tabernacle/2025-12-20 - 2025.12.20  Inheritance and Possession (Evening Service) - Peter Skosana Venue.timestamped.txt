[55:45] with

[55:51] This morning I tried to keep time.
[55:55] Was I punctual?
[55:58] Oh,
[56:00] okay.
[56:03] I would like us to open the book of
[56:05] Joshua.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Uh,
[56:10] chapter 14.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Joshua chapter 14.
[56:17] I would like us to read verse 6.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Verse 6.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; And then jump over
[56:24] to verse 9.
[56:27] vers 9
[56:28] &gt;&gt; and jump over to
[56:31] verse 12
[56:33] &gt;&gt; vers 12
[56:34] &gt;&gt; up to 14
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Joshua chapter 14
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Joshua 14
[56:40] &gt;&gt; we'll read verse 6
[56:45] &gt;&gt; then jump over to verse 9
[56:48] &gt;&gt; then goes to 12 up to up to 14
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Joshua 14:
[56:58] Then the children of Judah came unto
[57:01] Joshua and Gilgal and Caleb the son of
[57:04] Jean the Kennesite said unto him, Thou
[57:09] knowest the thing that the Lord said
[57:11] unto Moses the man of God concerning me
[57:14] and thee in Gadesh Baner. Verse N. And
[57:19] Moses sw on that day, saying, Surely the
[57:23] land whereon thy feet had trotted shall
[57:26] be thine inheritance, and thy childrens
[57:29] forever, because thou has wholly
[57:32] followed the Lord my God.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Verse 12. Now therefore, give me this
[57:38] mountain,
[57:40] wherefore the Lord, whereof the Lord
[57:42] spake in that day. For thou heardest in
[57:47] that day how the Anakings were there,
[57:51] and that the cities were great and
[57:53] fenced. If so be the Lord will be with
[57:57] me, then I shall be able to drive them
[58:00] out as the Lord said. And Joshua blessed
[58:03] him and gave unto Caleb the son of
[58:06] Jeffon Hebron for an inheritance.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebron therefore became the
[58:12] inheritance of Caleb the son of Jeffon
[58:16] the Kennazite unto this day because that
[58:19] he wholly followed the Lord God of
[58:21] Israel.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Okay, let us just bow our heads.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; I will request our pastor pastor
[58:34] to just bless the reading of the word.
[58:38] Amen.
[58:40] Let us pray.
[58:43] Our dear mighty heavenly father,
[58:46] once again,
[58:49] we have gathered into thy presence.
[58:53] When we come into thy presence,
[58:56] we just not come.
[58:59] We are expecting
[59:02] our Lord to come and speak to us.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Now, there is our brother here. We know
[59:09] him
[59:11] is elder pet
[59:14] &gt;&gt; but he has read the scripture here.
[59:19] We are here humbly
[59:22] beseeching thee to come.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; And take over.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Take over this body.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Use his voice
[59:33] &gt;&gt; and use the interpreter's voice.
[59:36] Father, deliver
[59:39] your tidings
[59:41] unto us
[59:43] so that when we leave here,
[59:46] we must be like the people who were
[59:49] going to immerse,
[59:52] we say, why did our hearts
[59:56] not burn within us
[59:58] when he was with us speaking?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Lest our hearts
[1:00:04] b
[1:00:06] when you speak with us this afternoon.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; I pray in the precious name of our Lord,
[1:00:13] Savior, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you. You may be uh seated. God
[1:00:22] bless you.
[1:00:26] Yeah.
[1:00:28] Okay. We This will be just part two of
[1:00:31] what we're talking about.
[1:00:36] Uh this morning we we spoke about the
[1:00:41] inheritance
[1:00:45] and the possession
[1:00:49] and and the text is still the same
[1:00:54] that you beware of the delaying process.
[1:01:00] Okay. Amen.
[1:01:02] So
[1:01:05] I said this morning
[1:01:10] there is a relevant ministry
[1:01:16] and then if we have a relevant ministry
[1:01:22] any other ministry
[1:01:27] will be a good ministry.
[1:01:31] But uh it won't benefit the cause
[1:01:38] because what is important
[1:01:41] we need to check our course that we are
[1:01:44] on course
[1:01:49] and then there shouldn't be anything
[1:01:51] that will derail the cause.
[1:01:58] But now what is happening is
[1:02:03] uh
[1:02:05] during the
[1:02:07] time of the Old Testament.
[1:02:11] If you compare that with the time we're
[1:02:14] living in now,
[1:02:18] we we started by reading Revelation
[1:02:22] chapter 5. We read from verse one up to
[1:02:24] 4.
[1:02:27] from verse one and then speaking the the
[1:02:32] the the verses that we spoke.
[1:02:36] It was about the book
[1:02:39] that is written without an an insight
[1:02:43] within and without.
[1:02:46] And then there was nobody that could
[1:02:49] come and take this book.
[1:02:54] And read it and explain everything.
[1:02:58] I know that you all know about that.
[1:03:02] You've got an answer to that.
[1:03:06] But what I I'll try to bring in is this
[1:03:12] that as it is now
[1:03:16] the the seals have been revealed.
[1:03:20] Open open and revealed.
[1:03:24] Amen.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Now if they are open and revealed,
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; we know that
[1:03:32] and we have the revelation of that.
[1:03:36] But then what is the relevant ministry
[1:03:39] now at this time?
[1:03:44] The relevant ministry at this time is a
[1:03:48] ministry that would bring about the
[1:03:51] change of the body
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; because we already have our inheritance.
[1:04:05] We got our inheritance
[1:04:08] and then we have reached the promised
[1:04:10] land.
[1:04:12] That's a
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; uh we read this morning
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; that now uh
[1:04:20] uh when they were in the promised land
[1:04:22] or or what what is our inheritance
[1:04:29] then we've learned that our inheritance
[1:04:34] is that now our forefathers
[1:04:38] deviated from believing the word of God.
[1:04:45] They were supposed to stick to believing
[1:04:47] the word of God.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; And then what they did,
[1:04:55] they lowered their gloves.
[1:05:04] You know in the boxing
[1:05:07] boxing
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; they say your gloves must always be up
[1:05:09] here.
[1:05:14] once you can lower
[1:05:16] that second
[1:05:19] you'll be down
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; because you are in a ring you're
[1:05:24] fighting
[1:05:26] remember now
[1:05:29] we're living at the end time
[1:05:31] and being on the end time
[1:05:35] the enemy
[1:05:37] is aware
[1:05:39] that he's got No chance.
[1:05:45] Everything is
[1:05:50] being finished.
[1:05:52] You you you keep the standard.
[1:05:57] You don't you don't lower the standard.
[1:06:01] You continue with the standard. Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; And then our pastor,
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; everybody
[1:06:13] can be a witness
[1:06:18] that he have done a very good job.
[1:06:22] Amen.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; He has taken us in.
[1:06:27] He has finished up everything.
[1:06:31] If we fail,
[1:06:33] it will be ourselves.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; He has done everything.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:06:43] let's compare him
[1:06:46] with with with Joshua.
[1:06:50] Now Joshua,
[1:06:52] they came to him
[1:06:54] firstly. They said now
[1:06:58] uh provided what was in Moses was in
[1:07:00] you.
[1:07:05] He proved to them
[1:07:09] that what was in Moses
[1:07:12] was in him. Then we've just read a
[1:07:15] scripture here
[1:07:17] where Joshua said,
[1:07:20] "Give me that mountain."
[1:07:24] So he said, "Now Moses promised me that.
[1:07:28] Now stick to your promise.
[1:07:31] I was 40 years then.
[1:07:35] Now I'm 80.
[1:07:37] I'm stronger than that time."
[1:07:42] Right? Amen. And then Joshua gave him.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; But remember that
[1:07:51] He pointed a a a place
[1:07:56] that has got enemy.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; But what did God say unto them?
[1:08:03] I read the scripture in the morning.
[1:08:07] He said now you must go and defeat them.
[1:08:13] That that is the word of God. That is
[1:08:16] the promise. He said I will be with you.
[1:08:19] You fight them.
[1:08:22] You defeat them. It's yours. I give you
[1:08:25] that. Please.
[1:08:28] Now Joshua
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; and Caleb, stick to that.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Now I pointed something in the morning
[1:08:39] about uh our
[1:08:43] uh about uh
[1:08:46] Adam.
[1:08:49] I will I will read something here.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Uh it says here
[1:08:55] in this uh book an exposition of the
[1:09:00] seven church ages.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; That's an epician church age.
[1:09:05] He says here
[1:09:08] the first son Adam was the spoken seed
[1:09:12] word of God.
[1:09:18] He was given a bride to to reproduce
[1:09:21] himself.
[1:09:26] That is why
[1:09:28] the bride was given to him
[1:09:33] to reproduce himself
[1:09:37] to produce another son of God.
[1:09:42] But he fell. hour. Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; She fell by
[1:09:49] hybridization.
[1:09:56] She caused him to die.
[1:10:00] Are we together?
[1:10:03] Adam
[1:10:04] was the spoken seed word of God. Amen.
[1:10:11] He was given a a a bride
[1:10:17] to reproduce himself.
[1:10:20] Right now it says the second son
[1:10:24] Jesus
[1:10:26] also a spoken seed word of God
[1:10:36] and then was given
[1:10:41] uh also I mean sorry say sorry let me
[1:10:43] read it was given a bride like Adam
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; but before he could marry her
[1:10:54] she also had fallen
[1:10:59] Adam
[1:11:02] did not backslide
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; second Adam
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; did not backslide
[1:11:10] We're talking about she here
[1:11:16] then.
[1:11:19] But before you could marry her,
[1:11:22] she also had fallen.
[1:11:26] She, like Adam's wife,
[1:11:30] was put to test
[1:11:33] whether she would believe the word of
[1:11:36] God
[1:11:39] and leave
[1:11:40] or doubt the word of
[1:11:44] and die. She doubted.
[1:11:48] She left the word,
[1:11:50] she died.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:55] Now that's where now you come in
[1:12:00] because I was speaking about she
[1:12:06] some of you sisters started doubting
[1:12:09] yourself out.
[1:12:16] Then he said from a little group of the
[1:12:20] true seed of the word
[1:12:28] God will present Christ with a beloved
[1:12:32] bride.
[1:12:38] She is a virgin of his word.
[1:12:44] What makes her the virgin of the word?
[1:12:48] Because she never doubted the word.
[1:12:53] that makes her the virgin of the word.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; So the first two
[1:13:03] doubted the word
[1:13:06] and died.
[1:13:08] Remember that now Adam was a spoken seed
[1:13:12] word of God.
[1:13:18] Being a spoken seed word
[1:13:22] She can't backslide.
[1:13:26] Right.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; The one that backslided
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; was the back a byproduct.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said in order that God
[1:13:38] should be a redeemer,
[1:13:42] he did that purpose.
[1:13:46] Are we together? knowing that he he
[1:13:50] can't be a redeemer
[1:13:52] without anything to redeem.
[1:13:56] And then he can't backslide
[1:14:00] because what he produces the seed word
[1:14:07] from a little group of the true and seed
[1:14:11] word of God.
[1:14:18] God will present Christ with a beloved
[1:14:20] bride.
[1:14:28] She is a virgin of his word.
[1:14:35] What is the meaning of the virgin of his
[1:14:37] word?
[1:14:42] It means she's going she's going to take
[1:14:44] the word as is. Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Remember now when it says the bride,
[1:14:54] it's referring to us male male and
[1:14:56] female.
[1:14:59] See the bride
[1:15:01] taking the word.
[1:15:04] Why? When it says seat word
[1:15:09] It means that the seed
[1:15:12] when you plant it,
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; it will produce a seed.
[1:15:18] But before it produc a seed,
[1:15:21] it will go a process
[1:15:25] where it becomes stock and etc etc.
[1:15:30] But at the end it becomes the seed. So
[1:15:34] he planted the seed.
[1:15:37] to produce the sweet.
[1:15:40] That is why now that is the virgin.
[1:15:45] It's not mixed up.
[1:15:47] It's a virgin of his will.
[1:15:50] Now when you take the word of God
[1:15:53] as per promise
[1:15:56] that is what we call the virgin of the
[1:15:58] word
[1:16:01] because you plant it as it is.
[1:16:05] It has got life in it.
[1:16:07] Now Jesus Christ says
[1:16:11] the words that I speak
[1:16:15] they are spirit
[1:16:17] and they are life. Now the word has got
[1:16:20] life within it.
[1:16:23] When you hear the word of God
[1:16:26] that word find a place in your heart.
[1:16:31] And when it finds a place of blood,
[1:16:34] it produces itself.
[1:16:37] That is why Abraham
[1:16:40] makes the word.
[1:16:43] But by that but during that time the
[1:16:46] word was in a being
[1:16:50] and that being was Melkisedc.
[1:16:53] Then
[1:16:54] they started communicating
[1:16:58] speaking about the word. That's why the
[1:17:01] Bible says
[1:17:03] he
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; gave Abraham
[1:17:07] bread and wine.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Bread types the word.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Word
[1:17:17] wine.
[1:17:19] It types the spirit
[1:17:21] that is himself. That's why he gave of
[1:17:25] himself.
[1:17:28] He he gave Abraham of himself.
[1:17:33] Now after taking that
[1:17:36] Abraham
[1:17:37] became himself because he gave of
[1:17:39] himself
[1:17:43] the word is a spirit and it's life. When
[1:17:48] it finds a place, it becomes the way
[1:17:52] and where it landed,
[1:17:55] it produces the way.
[1:17:58] Are
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; we together? Now our inheritance
[1:18:03] is that now
[1:18:06] our forefathers
[1:18:09] deviated from the faith of the way.
[1:18:15] Now why am I saying that we must be
[1:18:18] careful
[1:18:20] that we should not have a delaying
[1:18:22] process?
[1:18:25] Because anything
[1:18:27] that is not of the word
[1:18:30] it will delay you
[1:18:33] because God
[1:18:35] cannot react.
[1:18:38] The only thing that attracts God
[1:18:43] is his own way. God is attracted by his
[1:18:46] own way
[1:18:48] and is attracted by a believer that
[1:18:51] believe his way.
[1:18:55] It's like when he gives a promise
[1:18:58] that promise is divine.
[1:19:00] Now he stick to that divine promise.
[1:19:05] The Bible says that promise is divine.
[1:19:10] It's precious
[1:19:12] and it's great. the great precious
[1:19:16] divine
[1:19:20] says now he gives you promises you you
[1:19:22] must go and read it
[1:19:25] in the book of Peter
[1:19:28] second Peter chapter 1 vers4
[1:19:31] he says he gave you that divine
[1:19:34] promise and then that promise will
[1:19:36] produce itself
[1:19:41] are we together
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; so Now, now it continues. Now, Christ
[1:19:47] will give you a beloved bride name. She
[1:19:50] is the virgin of his word.
[1:19:54] She is a virgin because she she knows no
[1:19:58] manmade creed or dogmas
[1:20:05] by and through the members of the bride
[1:20:09] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[1:20:12] of God.
[1:20:19] All that was promised by God,
[1:20:22] it will be fulfilled through you.
[1:20:25] All the promise.
[1:20:27] Now you must know then that what has
[1:20:31] been promised
[1:20:33] it will be fulfilled through you.
[1:20:37] Not through your own power.
[1:20:40] No, it's through the seed that has been
[1:20:43] planted in you.
[1:20:46] The Bible says first John chapter 3
[1:20:51] verse 9 says a child of God does not sin
[1:20:56] because the seed of God
[1:20:59] remains in him.
[1:21:02] Now that seed will produce of itself
[1:21:07] because that seed itself
[1:21:10] it's life. It's not you producing them.
[1:21:14] It's the seed that is in you.
[1:21:17] Are we together? Amen. So she is a
[1:21:20] virgin because she knows no man-made
[1:21:24] creed or dogmas
[1:21:31] by and through the members of the bride
[1:21:34] will be fulfilled will fulfill all the
[1:21:38] promise of promises of God
[1:21:46] to be made manifest in the virgin.
[1:21:53] The word promise
[1:21:56] came to the virgin Mary.
[1:22:01] But the word of promise
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; was he himself
[1:22:08] to be made manifest.
[1:22:11] Amen. The word of promise is that he
[1:22:14] must come and be manifested. It was a
[1:22:18] promise. Behold, a virgin shall conceive
[1:22:22] and bear a son.
[1:22:25] Remember now,
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; and his name shall be called
[1:22:29] wonderful
[1:22:31] counselor, the mighty God, the
[1:22:34] everlasting father, the prince of peace.
[1:22:38] Now after
[1:22:41] that promise
[1:22:43] arrived
[1:22:45] and John says
[1:22:47] this there's the lamb of God.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; It's like when the prophet said
[1:22:54] the way is now in the bride.
[1:22:59] Now the bride of God, thus said the
[1:23:02] Lord, he knows what to do with that,
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; And
[1:23:11] when she knows what to do with that,
[1:23:15] it becomes a mystery.
[1:23:18] It's mysterious to an individual.
[1:23:23] Look, the Bible says,
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; "I will give you a hidden mana
[1:23:31] hidden
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; and then I'll give you a white stone.
[1:23:39] We spoke about the story this morning
[1:23:43] that now your name which is your new
[1:23:47] name will be rich in there.
[1:23:52] You are the only one.
[1:23:54] That is why it's a mystery.
[1:23:57] It's a secret mystery.
[1:24:02] It's a secret mystery because
[1:24:06] the prophet says
[1:24:08] the devil must not know.
[1:24:13] That is why even heaven
[1:24:16] was quiet.
[1:24:20] That is why even himself
[1:24:22] is not supposed to utter it.
[1:24:26] It's a secret mystery.
[1:24:30] yourself, you will be given
[1:24:33] because you eat from the hidden manner.
[1:24:37] When when you eat you, that is why I
[1:24:40] said before we started that it should be
[1:24:43] a a ministry
[1:24:47] that is relevant
[1:24:49] right to the time that we are living in
[1:24:53] now. You are the only one
[1:24:57] that is feasting
[1:24:59] on that carcass.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; You are the only one.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; You are the one that is is is
[1:25:07] taking in.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Okay. Father.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; The word promise
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; or the word of promise
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; came to the Virgin Mary,
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; but that was of a promise.
[1:25:28] That but that was of promise was that
[1:25:33] was that which was of promise was he
[1:25:40] to be made manifest.
[1:25:44] Like in John 1:18,
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; no man had seen God
[1:25:50] at any time.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; The only the only begotten son
[1:25:59] which is in the bosom of the father.
[1:26:02] He had declared it. He had affirm it.
[1:26:08] He had announced it
[1:26:10] publicly
[1:26:13] and officially.
[1:26:15] That's why he said he had declared him.
[1:26:19] The father had declared him.
[1:26:24] But then what I want you to notice
[1:26:28] that the Bible Bible says,
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; "Behold, a virgin shall conceive
[1:26:34] and bear a son and his name shall be
[1:26:37] called wonderful
[1:26:41] right when he came his name was Jesus."
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Was not wonderful. Wonderful.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; So it seems to be a contradiction.
[1:26:52] counselor.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; He was not a counselor,
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; but they could not see him when he's
[1:27:00] counseling through the word,
[1:27:04] when he's going to the synagogue
[1:27:07] and correcting everything.
[1:27:09] He went to the synagogue. He took the
[1:27:12] book and said, "Today, that scripture is
[1:27:16] fulfilled in your eyes. in your eyes.
[1:27:20] They expect they're expecting a certain
[1:27:22] type of counselor.
[1:27:28] Then you take that and bring it to our
[1:27:31] time. Then it says he's a counselor
[1:27:35] and then he's a mighty God.
[1:27:39] They didn't see him
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; when he was expressing himself,
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; when he was manifesting the mighty God.
[1:27:50] When he said
[1:27:52] when he walked upon the sea,
[1:27:55] when he multiply brave,
[1:27:57] when he raised the dead,
[1:28:00] when he calmed the storm, they could not
[1:28:03] see that is a mighty God.
[1:28:07] Even the very same one,
[1:28:10] the one that pointed him
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; and said,
[1:28:15] "There's the lamb of God.
[1:28:20] When now the lamb of God was
[1:28:22] manifesting,
[1:28:25] they came to him. Said that lamb you
[1:28:29] were talking about.
[1:28:31] He started his own church.
[1:28:34] Then he said, "No, okay, go and find
[1:28:36] out."
[1:28:39] Go and ask him. He's the one that
[1:28:41] appointed him. He didn't say to them as
[1:28:44] he started definitely. I told you that I
[1:28:48] must decrease. He must increase.
[1:28:52] No.
[1:28:54] He said you go and find go and
[1:28:56] investigate and find out who who is he.
[1:29:01] And when they arrived,
[1:29:04] he didn't say hallelujah.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; You came at the right man. I am the
[1:29:08] Messiah.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; He was the one that knows that was a
[1:29:13] Messiah.
[1:29:16] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; He will perform
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; what the Messiah Messiah was supposed to
[1:29:23] perform
[1:29:25] individually.
[1:29:28] You will see
[1:29:30] yourself.
[1:29:32] Because when he was performing the signs
[1:29:35] of Messiah,
[1:29:38] he asked them, "Who do you say that I
[1:29:40] the son of man am?"
[1:29:44] And then Peter said, "Thou art the
[1:29:46] Christ." And then from that day took the
[1:29:50] keys,
[1:29:51] I am through.
[1:29:54] I am finished now with my second pool.
[1:29:59] He did the first pool, walked upon the
[1:30:02] sea, and do all those. The second pool,
[1:30:06] he was with the Pharisees. He was with
[1:30:08] the Pharisees.
[1:30:10] He rebuked the Pharisees. And after
[1:30:13] Peter recognized him,
[1:30:15] remember that we're talking about the
[1:30:18] third pool. Now he was crossing over to
[1:30:20] the third pool.
[1:30:23] After Peter recognized him, he became an
[1:30:28] enemy.
[1:30:31] Then the delaying tactics came.
[1:30:35] The very same Peter,
[1:30:38] the very same Peter was given the keys
[1:30:43] of the kingdom of God. When he said,
[1:30:46] "Now, I'm going now to the third pool."
[1:30:49] Now,
[1:30:51] when he went to the third pool,
[1:30:54] Peter said,
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; you know, his third pool was that I'm
[1:30:58] I'm going to Jerusalem.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be arrested.
[1:31:05] I'm going to die.
[1:31:07] I'm going to resurrect.
[1:31:10] Now Peter and all the disciples
[1:31:14] remained
[1:31:16] delayed
[1:31:19] by the process
[1:31:21] because they said to him, Peter said to
[1:31:23] him,
[1:31:25] he called him aside and said, "Rabbi,
[1:31:30] you are backsliding.
[1:31:34] Nobody will touch you. Look at here.
[1:31:38] born.
[1:31:40] Nobody will touch you.
[1:31:43] And then what did he say?
[1:31:45] He saw behind him,
[1:31:48] not Peter. No, he saw a a demon.
[1:31:53] He said, "You there
[1:31:55] get the behind him."
[1:31:58] Right. Amen.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Before he was arrested,
[1:32:05] he said, "Tonight,
[1:32:09] This is what going to happen with me.
[1:32:12] We are all going to be disappointed.
[1:32:17] What did Peter say?
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; The one with the keys.
[1:32:22] He said, "Yes, these are going to be not
[1:32:26] me.
[1:32:27] Not me."
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Is when he says,
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; "Uh,
[1:32:34] before the coke could grow,
[1:32:38] once the first time you would have
[1:32:40] denied me three times.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Now he was getting into a third pool
[1:32:50] after
[1:32:52] he gave them communion.
[1:32:55] The Bible said they said,
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; they had a hymn
[1:33:01] of entering now into the third pool,
[1:33:06] they sang
[1:33:08] after he said
[1:33:11] after the devil
[1:33:14] has entered into.
[1:33:17] So he start singing. Now
[1:33:20] then he said okay let's go and pray
[1:33:23] you guys you are saying
[1:33:26] there's nothing that will happen to me
[1:33:28] what does the pro promise say the
[1:33:31] promise says I will be crucified
[1:33:34] and I will resurrect the third day and I
[1:33:36] will meet you at Galilee
[1:33:40] let's go and pray
[1:33:42] you pray that I must not be crucified
[1:33:46] I will pray that let this thing pass on
[1:33:53] you sit here start praying you three
[1:33:58] come with me he hoped and said no in
[1:34:02] case of money stop and pray
[1:34:06] you can't pray against the word of God
[1:34:10] you rather sleep
[1:34:13] they do and slept
[1:34:15] what would they
[1:34:17] so he knows what is going to happen.
[1:34:21] They are against that. They started
[1:34:23] sleeping. I'm sure
[1:34:26] Peter said
[1:34:28] now
[1:34:31] and slept.
[1:34:34] Are we together now? Where was it? It
[1:34:38] was now on the third pool.
[1:34:41] The third pool was uh they've crossed
[1:34:44] over now.
[1:34:46] Where are we now?
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; We are on the third point. We have
[1:34:50] crossed over.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; We have received our inheritance.
[1:34:56] And when we when Joshua
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; gave Caleb,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; his place, what happened?
[1:35:05] What did he do with that place?
[1:35:09] Are we together now? We have
[1:35:13] the thirdful ministry.
[1:35:17] The third ministry is the revelation of
[1:35:19] the seven seal.
[1:35:23] The seven seal have been revealed to us.
[1:35:27] Are we having the rapturing faith
[1:35:34] or we are saying to Christ
[1:35:37] over our dead body will never be
[1:35:39] crucified?
[1:35:42] You know, Peter ended up influencing the
[1:35:45] other disciples
[1:35:49] against Jesus Christ that he is not
[1:35:52] going there. They all said no, you won't
[1:35:56] go there.
[1:35:59] Are we together now?
[1:36:02] uh I am saying here
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; uh what is the benefit
[1:36:10] of the importance of the revelation of
[1:36:12] the seven se
[1:36:20] benefit
[1:36:22] of the revelation of the seven
[1:36:26] is that now we we will have the
[1:36:30] rapturing faith Amen.
[1:36:34] Right. Amen.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; A rapturing faith
[1:36:37] that will bring about the changes.
[1:36:42] There are promises
[1:36:45] that this and this and this and this
[1:36:47] will happen.
[1:36:48] There were promises
[1:36:51] that this and this and this will happen.
[1:36:54] And the Messiah
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; will say
[1:37:00] tell no one.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; And what did the prophet say about the
[1:37:05] revelation of the seven se?
[1:37:08] He said it's not for the public.
[1:37:12] Keep it to yourself.
[1:37:14] I don't say keep it to yourself. What
[1:37:18] what is the value of keeping it to
[1:37:20] yourself?
[1:37:21] But if you have
[1:37:25] the revelation of the seven se
[1:37:28] and I have and the other one have we
[1:37:32] will know that we
[1:37:35] will be able to fellowship about that.
[1:37:41] We are at this era
[1:37:46] where now every scripture is manifested.
[1:37:55] Right, let's continue.
[1:37:58] God was made manifest.
[1:38:02] He himself
[1:38:05] acted at the same time
[1:38:08] and fulfilled his own way of promise
[1:38:14] in the virgin. That's what he did. He
[1:38:17] acted himself.
[1:38:20] He manifested himself.
[1:38:24] He fulfilled his own way
[1:38:27] of promise in a virgin. God has done
[1:38:32] that with us.
[1:38:35] He acted himself.
[1:38:37] He manifested himself.
[1:38:40] Now the the the the the the the uh uh
[1:38:43] the rapturing faith
[1:38:47] is when God has manifested himself
[1:38:53] in yourself.
[1:38:55] It was an angel that had brought a
[1:38:57] message.
[1:39:00] It was an angel
[1:39:03] that met Joshua.
[1:39:05] It was an angel that met E A Abraham.
[1:39:11] It was an angel that met Brother
[1:39:14] Brennan.
[1:39:16] It's an angel that met the bride. The
[1:39:20] bride met the angel.
[1:39:23] When he said, "No, have you met me?"
[1:39:28] He's speaking about that angel.
[1:39:31] And who is that angel?
[1:39:34] Brother Brennan.
[1:39:36] So
[1:39:37] the angel and he said this angel is
[1:39:41] noted.
[1:39:44] It's a notable one.
[1:39:47] Right? Amen.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; And then he says now the notable one
[1:39:51] was the one that came to him.
[1:39:55] Are we together? Of all the seven angels
[1:40:01] that were flying,
[1:40:03] going eastward,
[1:40:05] there was a notable Lord
[1:40:09] together that flew to him.
[1:40:13] He knew that angel.
[1:40:17] And then what happened?
[1:40:19] That was his ministry.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; The the new commission,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; the new commission
[1:40:27] is the ministry of an angel.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; The new commission to Joshua
[1:40:35] was an angel that he met.
[1:40:38] The new commission to Abraham
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; was the angel that he has made.
[1:40:45] The new commission to you
[1:40:48] is the angel in the form of the revealed
[1:40:51] word
[1:40:53] that came to you.
[1:40:56] The prophet met an angel.
[1:41:00] When he met this angel, he went
[1:41:02] eastwards. He went westwards and met
[1:41:05] that angel.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Look,
[1:41:12] the pyramid of
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Junior Jackson
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; had a white stone
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; was deep down there.
[1:41:20] And when brother Brennham Brennham
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; was going westward,
[1:41:26] he was going to get the interpretation
[1:41:29] of that
[1:41:33] of that wis. Then he went westward.
[1:41:37] And then when he went westward, he met
[1:41:40] the angel
[1:41:41] of that interpretation
[1:41:44] of that west. Remember that was a
[1:41:48] cornerstone.
[1:41:51] That was a cornerstone
[1:41:54] and it became a capstone
[1:41:58] to cap what
[1:42:01] the pyramid which are the seven church
[1:42:03] ages.
[1:42:06] And then in capping them
[1:42:08] he met an angel.
[1:42:12] Now we
[1:42:14] have met
[1:42:16] exactly
[1:42:18] that angel.
[1:42:20] Are we together?
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; That angel, I mean when brother Brennham
[1:42:24] came back,
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; he gave that h a book or interpretation
[1:42:30] or the sword
[1:42:34] or the revelation
[1:42:36] to the Joshua,
[1:42:38] our pastors,
[1:42:40] it is that angel.
[1:42:42] The Bible says or brother says a pastor
[1:42:47] behind the pullpit
[1:42:49] is an angel.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Now when we meet
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; the pastor behind the pullpit, we are
[1:43:00] not meeting an individual. We are
[1:43:02] meeting the word.
[1:43:06] That angel is that word. When when it's
[1:43:09] revealed unto you, it becomes your
[1:43:12] theopanop.
[1:43:13] that very so he met the constellation
[1:43:18] of the seven angels. Now each and every
[1:43:21] one of us belongs to that constellation.
[1:43:26] You belong to that constellation
[1:43:29] through brother Brennham because you are
[1:43:32] the product
[1:43:34] of the ministry of brother Brennham. So
[1:43:37] you are part of that constellation.
[1:43:40] Your pastor
[1:43:41] is the product
[1:43:45] of that constellation.
[1:43:47] He is in that constellation.
[1:43:50] And now he himself
[1:43:52] was the one that gave you that what you
[1:43:55] call it that that revelation, the word
[1:44:00] that he preached was revealed unto you.
[1:44:03] And when it is revealed unto you,
[1:44:07] you are the one
[1:44:09] that add
[1:44:13] from the carcass,
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; the hidden manner
[1:44:19] at that it's it's hidden.
[1:44:22] It's a secret. It's a mystery. It goes
[1:44:26] in that channel. It doesn't move in that
[1:44:29] channel.
[1:44:31] Are we together? Because in the garden
[1:44:33] of Eden, it went out of the channel.
[1:44:37] When it went out of the it caused all
[1:44:40] the damage that were causing
[1:44:43] now it's in that channel. It's for that
[1:44:46] little group.
[1:44:47] That's what he said. I heard the pastor
[1:44:50] one day said,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; he said, "You know what?
[1:44:54] There are people
[1:44:57] that uh
[1:44:59] are are receiving the word."
[1:45:03] He said he said the word that we preach
[1:45:07] there are a a few people
[1:45:12] that he said he said we are not
[1:45:14] preaching to the church.
[1:45:18] No. Amen.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; We preach to the heart.
[1:45:22] You you heard him saying that. He says
[1:45:25] preaching to the heart.
[1:45:27] That's where the throne of God is.
[1:45:30] And in the time that we are living in
[1:45:33] like we have read here that now they
[1:45:37] have rejected the second Adam.
[1:45:41] Then when he rejected the second Adam
[1:45:45] then what did he do?
[1:45:48] Then he went to
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; the individuals
[1:45:53] because the church age
[1:45:55] has closed down.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; So he's standing outside.
[1:46:02] He's knocking. The one that will open,
[1:46:05] he will come and die.
[1:46:10] Amen. It was an angel
[1:46:13] that brought the message
[1:46:16] to Mary.
[1:46:19] But the angel's message
[1:46:23] was the word of God.
[1:46:26] Amen.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; When Mary brought it,
[1:46:29] I mean the angel bring it,
[1:46:32] it was there.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now to scope
[1:46:42] or to have the scope of all events
[1:46:49] and to identify
[1:46:52] your dispensation.
[1:46:56] You you'll be able to spot your mark
[1:47:01] in your dispensation.
[1:47:04] You must be able to spot your mark
[1:47:09] in this dispensation.
[1:47:11] You must know exactly where you are.
[1:47:16] Put your mark in this dispensation.
[1:47:19] Where am I? Then you will be able to
[1:47:22] balance
[1:47:25] between the past
[1:47:29] and
[1:47:31] the present
[1:47:34] and the future. Then you'll be balanced
[1:47:37] yourself.
[1:47:40] You you identify first your your your
[1:47:44] dispensation.
[1:47:47] Once you identify your dispensation,
[1:47:50] But in which dispensation are you?
[1:47:54] Then you'll be able to balance actually
[1:47:57] where am I
[1:47:59] between the last days
[1:48:01] or between the future
[1:48:04] and the past then you balance through
[1:48:08] your dispensation.
[1:48:10] Otherwise without that
[1:48:12] you won't be able.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says.
[1:48:19] the God
[1:48:20] of this evil age
[1:48:24] as we have read in the scriptures.
[1:48:28] Uh this message
[1:48:32] points out the evils of this evil day.
[1:48:35] Amen.
[1:48:40] This message, this message
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; points out
[1:48:46] the evils
[1:48:49] of this evil age. We are in the civil
[1:48:52] age.
[1:48:54] The only message that can point out
[1:48:58] the evils of this time
[1:49:02] is this message. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; And is fitting to prophecy for this evil
[1:49:10] age.
[1:49:13] It points out the evils
[1:49:17] and it can even feed the prophecies.
[1:49:23] You are the only one
[1:49:25] that will notice
[1:49:28] the promises that are for this day.
[1:49:32] You are the only one
[1:49:34] that can interpret
[1:49:36] what is exactly happening in Russia.
[1:49:39] in Russia,
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; in America,
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; in the Vatican,
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; in in in in Israel,
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; you know, you are the only one that you
[1:49:49] are the only one that understands that
[1:49:55] the world doesn't know what's going on.
[1:49:58] The whole South Africa doesn't know
[1:50:00] that.
[1:50:01] Now, the prophet says the evils of this
[1:50:04] age
[1:50:06] and it's fitting
[1:50:09] to prophesy
[1:50:13] for this evil age. Anything that is
[1:50:15] happening, we are the only one
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; that
[1:50:20] could
[1:50:22] interpret this.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; He says, I'm reading God of this evil
[1:50:29] age.
[1:50:31] I'm reading paragraph 29. Amen. Right.
[1:50:34] Oh, no. Now I'm reading 31.
[1:50:38] It's a very strong thing to think that
[1:50:42] uh that in evil age like this that God
[1:50:48] then will be calling his bride
[1:50:59] at this evil age.
[1:51:02] It's unbelievable
[1:51:04] that God could call his bride.
[1:51:10] People think that God will call his
[1:51:13] bride
[1:51:14] when things are very soft, when things
[1:51:17] are going smooth, when things are are
[1:51:20] okay.
[1:51:21] God called his bride.
[1:51:25] this very evil age
[1:51:28] when when the Messiah came. It was at
[1:51:31] the evil age.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; That is why when he was born,
[1:51:37] he was born in a manger. It was very
[1:51:40] evil. They were killing, they were doing
[1:51:42] all these things.
[1:51:44] So when there was evil in the land
[1:51:49] that's when God now
[1:51:51] when people are delaying
[1:51:55] with concentrating on the evils what is
[1:51:57] going on
[1:51:59] when people now are saying hey manga or
[1:52:02] whatever it is or Russia is doing this
[1:52:05] this this this what you call God is
[1:52:07] calling his bride
[1:52:10] he is talking swiftly to the bride
[1:52:16] Because
[1:52:18] everybody
[1:52:19] says, "Where are we going now?" The
[1:52:21] whole world is what you call. Trump is
[1:52:24] is on us.
[1:52:27] Russia is on what you call them and
[1:52:29] everything. The churches are going mad.
[1:52:32] Everything is going out now.
[1:52:35] But swiftly,
[1:52:37] there is a small voice.
[1:52:40] A small voice to the bride that the
[1:52:43] brideal are the only one
[1:52:47] look
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; the doubt
[1:52:51] descended.
[1:52:53] Scientists took it.
[1:52:55] They could not they could not interpret
[1:52:57] it until the prophet took it and turn it
[1:53:02] upside down and show them the face.
[1:53:06] You see?
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; They've got it right.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; It is there
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; in Washington DC. But they can't
[1:53:14] interpret it. You the smallest in the
[1:53:18] group.
[1:53:19] You can interpret that cloud.
[1:53:23] You are the only one that can identify
[1:53:26] yourself
[1:53:29] in the scriptures.
[1:53:31] You can point yourself.
[1:53:33] Here am I there? I am the bride
[1:53:37] according to the word and according to
[1:53:40] this that is happening. You can
[1:53:42] interpret any movement.
[1:53:47] You are the one that can interpret what
[1:53:49] the devil is doing right now.
[1:53:54] Now, amen. He says, "Now listen,
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; for Satan
[1:54:03] has not spoke of as a god of any other
[1:54:08] age than this
[1:54:16] is worshiped by millions
[1:54:19] and billions of people and they don't
[1:54:23] know it.
[1:54:26] Do you know that
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; they worship him unaware?
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; But you
[1:54:35] are the attribute,
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:42] The Lord's, you see the ministry. I
[1:54:44] mean, he says now you are the
[1:54:45] attributes.
[1:54:47] You don't remember it
[1:54:51] because you are just part of his life.
[1:54:54] You are part of God
[1:54:57] when you become a son or daughter
[1:55:01] of God just as you are part
[1:55:06] of your father.
[1:55:09] Then the attribute was the first one.
[1:55:16] That was the thought of God.
[1:55:19] The attribute itself all in one without
[1:55:23] being expressed
[1:55:25] without being expressed.
[1:55:28] Then when he expressed secondly, he
[1:55:31] become the weight.
[1:55:33] You are an attribute,
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. He became the word and then the
[1:55:42] word
[1:55:44] was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:55:49] So the bride is himself revealed.
[1:55:56] The word
[1:55:58] is in the bride. So the bride is himself
[1:56:02] revealed.
[1:56:05] The lamb broke the seals.
[1:56:08] and revealed them to his bride.
[1:56:12] And remember while they went to buy
[1:56:16] oil,
[1:56:18] you remember the scripture does not say
[1:56:22] they got it.
[1:56:27] They went to buy.
[1:56:30] Did they get it?
[1:56:34] Say the Bible doesn't say that.
[1:56:38] Now I'm about to finish. It says
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; the bride went in.
[1:56:48] There's a whole difference between the
[1:56:50] church and the bride.
[1:56:57] Went in in the wedding supper.
[1:57:02] That is why now after we have received
[1:57:07] our uh uh
[1:57:11] the what you call our inheritance
[1:57:16] and then we had it in our position.
[1:57:23] What are we doing?
[1:57:26] So now that's what I'm trying to tell
[1:57:28] you that because we have our our
[1:57:32] possession
[1:57:36] now we are encouraged
[1:57:40] we are encouraged
[1:57:42] by notifying
[1:57:44] our promises
[1:57:48] we we we are relaxing there's a pressure
[1:57:53] that whatever is going on
[1:57:55] we identifying our promises.
[1:57:59] We relax on our promises.
[1:58:02] We we check that while we are relaxing.
[1:58:06] What is our promises?
[1:58:10] How should we react to the promise?
[1:58:13] The devil will try by all means
[1:58:16] to prove to you that there isn't a right
[1:58:20] church.
[1:58:22] This one is doing that. This one is
[1:58:23] doing that. But we are looking at the
[1:58:26] promise.
[1:58:27] The promise says, "I will build my
[1:58:30] church.
[1:58:32] The gates of hell
[1:58:34] shall not prevail against you."
[1:58:37] When the pastor was preaching the last
[1:58:40] time, he said when our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:46] was saying,
[1:58:48] "I will build my church. The gates of
[1:58:51] hell shall not prevail against you. He
[1:58:55] was looking right at the gates of hell.
[1:58:59] He was looking at at Cesaria Philippi.
[1:59:05] Go and check what is Cesaria Philippi.
[1:59:09] It was a city that was built for the God
[1:59:15] that was where now the gate of hell was.
[1:59:20] He was looking at
[1:59:22] the gates of hell shall not prevail.
[1:59:25] He was standing there looking at the
[1:59:27] gates of hell.
[1:59:30] Are we together? Now those things are
[1:59:32] not in the Bible. The Bible says
[1:59:36] our Lord Jesus Christ was from the coast
[1:59:41] of Cesaria.
[1:59:43] Cesaria.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; But what made the pastor mention that?
[1:59:46] Because he said he said he was looking
[1:59:50] at that then I grasped it. I went and go
[1:59:54] and check and when I checked I found
[1:59:57] that yes that city was
[1:59:59] it was city for the demons.
[2:00:03] Are we together in the morning we spoke
[2:00:07] about the two and tribes
[2:00:10] that didn't want to cross over
[2:00:14] that didn't want to cross over.
[2:00:16] The prophet says those people that
[2:00:19] didn't want to cross
[2:00:21] when Jesus Christ find a man
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; in chains
[2:00:28] full of demons
[2:00:31] was it?
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; He says that place
[2:00:36] was those guys
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; they refused to cross over
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Reuben.
[2:00:44] Who's that word?
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Get and the half of manas.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; They didn't cross over. They went. He
[2:00:50] said Moses said, "You don't want to go
[2:00:53] and fight. Your brothers must fight."
[2:00:57] And then they said, "Okay, fine. We'll
[2:00:58] go. We will leave our children." And
[2:01:02] those people. Brother Brham said, they
[2:01:06] never repented. Because they refused to
[2:01:09] cross.
[2:01:11] And Jesus came there and healed only
[2:01:14] that man.
[2:01:17] And the prophet says they chase Jesus
[2:01:19] away.
[2:01:21] Remember where he said now the demons
[2:01:23] must go to they they ask that the demons
[2:01:26] must go to the to the pigs
[2:01:30] in that place. It was the only person
[2:01:33] that was here.
[2:01:36] That's what the prophet said.
[2:01:39] So now it's a time to relax. But you
[2:01:43] cannot relax
[2:01:45] without your sword.
[2:01:50] The road, the way to the tree of life,
[2:01:57] the prophet spoke about
[2:02:00] standing in a gap.
[2:02:03] The prophet
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; was praying. Just find out there's a
[2:02:07] sword in his heart.
[2:02:09] The prophet was praying
[2:02:12] on a stone. You find a white eagle right
[2:02:17] within his heart.
[2:02:21] He was on a rock praying. There's a
[2:02:24] white rock directly with his heart. I
[2:02:27] mean the white eagle.
[2:02:32] Are we together? And then he was
[2:02:33] praying. There was a sword in his hand.
[2:02:38] Now those are the things that are not
[2:02:41] written in the Bible.
[2:02:43] It's only can be interpreted
[2:02:47] by you.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; There's quite a lot of scriptures.
[2:02:52] There's quite a lot of promises that are
[2:02:55] pertaining to you
[2:02:59] and the devil doesn't want you to go
[2:03:03] through them.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; So now
[2:03:07] You've got a position. The possession
[2:03:11] when you got your possession,
[2:03:13] this is what you you have to do
[2:03:16] with your position. You have possessed
[2:03:19] it. Now that you've possessed it, you
[2:03:22] look at all this one at this one. Look
[2:03:27] uh
[2:03:29] Caleb
[2:03:30] when he went to take that place,
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; it was not a clean place.
[2:03:36] It had giants
[2:03:40] giants. One we a person with five
[2:03:43] fingers
[2:03:47] actually six six this side six that
[2:03:52] like
[2:03:54] see
[2:03:56] you have to carry his sword. He had a
[2:03:58] young man that will carry his sword when
[2:03:59] he's going to war.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; But but but uh Caleb,
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; he said, "Give me that place.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; I will defeat them
[2:04:12] and I will take it." That's it. Amen.
[2:04:15] Then he was given that place.
[2:04:19] I always say, "Don't think you'll go to
[2:04:22] heaven on a rocking chair.
[2:04:27] Look at your promises.
[2:04:29] Have faith in a small thing.
[2:04:33] Then it will go bigger and bigger and
[2:04:35] bigger and bigger and bigger. Are we
[2:04:38] together? Amen.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; That's how it is. May the Lord bless you
[2:04:42] all. God bless you. Amen.
[2:04:51] May God bless you, my brother. God bless
[2:04:53] you. Amen.
