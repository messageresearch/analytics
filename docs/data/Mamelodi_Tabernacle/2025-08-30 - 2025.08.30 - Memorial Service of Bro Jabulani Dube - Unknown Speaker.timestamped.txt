[25:47] waiting for the interpreter this
[25:49] evening.
[25:52] Oh yeah.
[25:56] Before we read the word of God, we are
[25:59] going to pray.

[26:45] Amen. Amen.
[26:49] I appreciate the moment brother gave me.
[26:55] So what they are saying about I'm also a
[26:58] witness to that
[27:01] most of the time
[27:07] will be the first one to arrive at
[27:08] church. So
[27:12] he has his own parking which brother Dub
[27:15] always is taking care of.
[27:20] If he can find somebody parking on that
[27:22] spot, he's not
[27:24] he's not feeling well about that.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; What I learned about him, he was so
[27:31] humbled,
[27:35] you wouldn't say he's an elderly like
[27:37] that
[27:39] and he had respect
[27:44] to the saints.
[27:47] If there can be somebody
[27:51] maybe he's carrying his jacket.
[27:54] So he'll take him aside.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; And then he will say there's this
[28:00] certain brother.
[28:02] He gave me something.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; There's this kind of a sister. He gave
[28:07] me something.
[28:12] and then he will say I'm just asking
[28:14] that you offer a prayer over
[28:19] and then one day
[28:23] he said at home
[28:26] there's a certain spirit hovering there
[28:30] I don't know what it is
[28:34] I'm requesting
[28:38] I took
[28:39] as he has said
[28:42] and we went to his place
[28:47] and we were welcomed with a good spirit
[28:51] and we prayed. The following Sunday
[28:56] he said I'm free all those spirits are
[29:00] gone
[29:02] there is peace at home.
[29:07] I'm thankful saints
[29:09] and he was a soldier.
[29:13] Uh it's not long that he came to the
[29:15] message
[29:17] &gt;&gt; but it it seemed like he's been there
[29:20] for 30 years.
[29:26] He's not dead but he's asleep. God bless
[29:28] you my brother. Amen.
[29:30] [Applause]
[29:32] foreign.
[29:47] Amen.
[30:05] There's a man sent from God.
[30:13] You send a man amongst us.
[30:16] You give us a
[30:32] because of the weight
[30:35] to that man.
[30:47] [Music]
[30:53] Let your
[31:02] man speak it like that man.
[31:11] Amen. Amen.
[31:13] Amen.
[31:16] [Applause]
[31:21] &gt;&gt; We are thankful
[31:23] bless you.
[31:25] I bring the greetings as well from our
[31:27] pastor
[31:32] who was the pastor to our brother.
[31:38] Yes. Just few hours before I came I was
[31:40] with him.
[31:43] He wished to be here.
[31:46] He say let's just go and comfort the
[31:49] family
[31:51] because we know our brother is in a
[31:53] better place.
[31:56] Amen. Amen.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; So I just want to tell you
[32:02] that we our brother.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Everyone at church
[32:08] knows him very well because he treated
[32:11] every one of us
[32:14] so special
[32:16] like we are kings.
[32:19] He he can treat you the in a good way.
[32:24] thinking is just you. Thinking is just
[32:27] you.
[32:33] Every one of us
[32:36] shall
[32:38] when I arrive with my car. He will show
[32:42] it from far and then he will stand on
[32:44] the on the at the road.
[32:54] from he thought because I'm from
[32:59] he was a good man
[33:02] phoned me today
[33:05] called me today
[33:05] &gt;&gt; he so do you know how brother received a
[33:09] message
[33:12] so he was asking me
[33:15] I said I don't know
[33:17] he said while he's doing some make
[33:24] approach him
[33:26] and said, "Brother, you are at the right
[33:29] place.
[33:31] God has brought you here so that you can
[33:34] pave your way back to heaven.
[33:38] I want to tell you this. Before our
[33:40] brother came to church
[33:43] to look after our cars,
[33:46] we had many challenges.
[33:50] The local people,
[33:54] they were stealing the wheel caps of our
[33:56] car,
[33:59] the valve for the wheel,
[34:01] the spare wheels.
[34:04] And then until the church hired him
[34:10] from that day
[34:12] until today, we never received any
[34:15] complaint.
[34:17] So, uh, Amen.
[34:20] I I I personally made a joke out of that
[34:26] for sure.
[34:29] Maybe they see that he looks like
[34:34] thinking that if he can catch you
[34:37] when they by the time they report
[34:40] ah, you'll just be dust.
[34:47] It's me holding me by the hand.
[34:52] Amen.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. But he was a nice
[34:58] brother indeed.
[35:00] [Music]
[35:01] Ever smiling. I want to tell you this
[35:04] evening, not joking.
[35:07] He is in heaven.
[35:10] He made the right decision.
[35:13] He's young again.
[35:15] If you want to go to heaven,
[35:18] just visit that church of ours.
[35:21] And I believe in this evening. Our
[35:24] present here has made a changes in the
[35:27] area.
[35:29] We know ourself. We know where we come
[35:32] from. We know where we are. We know
[35:35] where we are going. And I'm not lying
[35:37] about that. True indeed. Amen.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; That's why when we met him, we felt like
[35:44] I was going all over the place,
[35:47] churches and whatever.
[35:50] But since I met these people,
[35:53] I'm a changed person.
[35:56] May his soul rest well under the altar.
[36:02] That's where God put him.
[36:05] Amen. Amen. So tonight,
[36:08] I'm not going to take much of your time.
[36:12] We were here yesterday.
[36:14] We had a wonderful service with the
[36:16] family and the neighbors.
[36:19] Continue again this evening
[36:22] and then we will finish tomorrow as we
[36:25] lay his remainings.
[36:29] May God richly bless you by honoring the
[36:32] word of God. Let's stand to our feet and
[36:36] sing a worshiing song.
[36:38] Amen.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:49] God
[36:56] see
[37:00] See God.
[37:03] [Music]
[37:13] Oh my way.
[37:15] [Music]
[37:24] [Applause]
[37:25] [Music]
[37:43] Amen. As we open our Bible
[37:48] in the book of Philippians chapter 2
[37:52] from verse 1 to 8.
[37:56] Amen.
[38:01] Philippians chapter 2 from verse 1 to8.
[38:04] If there be therefore any consolation in
[38:06] Christ, if any comfort of love, if any
[38:10] fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels
[38:13] and mercies,
[38:16] fulfill ye my joy, that ye be
[38:18] likeminded, having the same love, being
[38:22] of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing
[38:25] be done through strive of vain glory,
[38:29] but in loneliness of mind, let each
[38:32] esteem other better than themselves.
[38:36] Look not every man on his own things,
[38:39] but every man also on the things of
[38:41] others.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Let this man be in you, which was also
[38:46] in Christ Jesus.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Who being in the form of God, thought it
[38:51] not robbery to be equal with God.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. but made himself of no reputation,
[38:57] and took upon him the form of a servant,
[39:01] and ma was made in the likeness of men.
[39:04] And being found in fashion as a man, he
[39:07] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[39:11] death, even the death of the cross.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; So, I want to talk to you this evening
[39:21] about
[39:24] the unveiling of God.
[39:27] So yesterday we were talking about
[39:31] an amateur God.
[39:34] Amateur God, an unveiling of God,
[39:38] one and the same thing. We just continue
[39:43] from where we stopped yesterday.
[39:46] Amen. Amen. So the scripture here says
[39:51] everything that you do
[39:53] it should be in love
[39:57] in joy and and we must be in one accord,
[40:03] one mind. And let that mind that was in
[40:08] Christ
[40:10] be in you who being in the form of God
[40:14] not robbery
[40:18] to be equal with.
[40:21] Amen. Amen.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; So yesterday we gave the example of
[40:25] Moses.
[40:27] The Bible says
[40:30] Moses
[40:31] &gt;&gt; was God before Pharaoh and Aaron will be
[40:36] the prophet.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; So it was the pattern
[40:42] &gt;&gt; or the protocol
[40:44] that God used
[40:47] to reach us. So in life
[40:51] follow the protocol of life
[40:55] because our God He's a god of order.
[41:00] He do things orderly.
[41:02] So we need to follow things orderly
[41:05] to be able to please him.
[41:08] Now God in the beginning was God was not
[41:14] God. He became God after a certain level
[41:19] when he come down. when he come down his
[41:23] last journey
[41:26] on earth was when he get inside a man
[41:31] and when he's inside a man that man
[41:35] becomes God and then it was the end of
[41:38] God
[41:40] in this world and from that time when
[41:43] that man take a step it was God walking
[41:49] amen that is
[41:52] Jabu was an amate God.
[41:55] God has unveiled himself
[41:57] in him.
[42:00] Maybe other people have not had an
[42:02] opportunity of talking about him. But
[42:06] since he received the message,
[42:09] he was a transformed person.
[42:12] He was a person, a new person, not that
[42:16] old person.
[42:18] Amen. Amen. And it was not when he was
[42:20] talking
[42:22] but you saw his life.
[42:26] I read here the man of God says the
[42:29] weight had to come from Moses first.
[42:37] You see one man the word of God must
[42:41] first come from him.
[42:44] Moses had the way.
[42:47] They were written by God.
[42:51] Nobody could interpret them.
[42:55] But Moses had to interpret them.
[43:01] That's the reason he veiled his faith.
[43:07] Amen. Amen. So God had to come down and
[43:13] incarnate himself
[43:15] in Moses. When the people need the
[43:19] interpretation
[43:20] of the word of God, they must get it
[43:23] from
[43:25] amen.
[43:27] But there were those that said we want
[43:31] to get the interpretation
[43:34] from God and when God come, they run
[43:37] away. because you cannot face him.
[43:41] That's why you cannot see God with a
[43:45] naked eye. He has to hide himself
[43:49] in a human being. And that human being,
[43:53] God says, he is God. He made us God.
[44:00] Here it is. We could pick it,
[44:05] pick it up
[44:07] and everything else, but it's got to be
[44:10] revealed.
[44:12] In order to reveal,
[44:14] Moses has to come to the people. Amen.
[44:19] Amen. Amen. So many a time we miss God
[44:23] because when we look at a human being
[44:26] and despise him not knowing God veiled
[44:31] himself
[44:33] that person and Moses was that person
[44:37] when God was ve
[44:43] I continue
[44:45] hid behind the veil
[44:50] Moses veiled his face.
[44:54] Moses was the living word veiled. Then
[45:01] the people saw the pillar of fire.
[45:04] Now say now we are satisfied.
[45:07] But let Moses speak
[45:10] because he speaks of God.
[45:13] Don't let God speak
[45:16] lest we die. Moses walked
[45:20] right in that pillar of fire.
[45:24] When Moses was walking, it was God
[45:27] working. When you listen to Moses, you
[45:31] were listening to God. Don't say, I want
[45:35] to bypass Moses and listen to God. If
[45:39] God can face you when you are not with
[45:42] him, you will not stand him.
[45:46] Amen.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; The anointing
[45:51] &gt;&gt; is a person.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; The anointing is
[45:58] the word Christ means the anointed one.
[46:02] The anointed one. That is the word
[46:05] Christ. Then Moses
[46:08] was Christ in his days.
[46:12] He was the anointed one.
[46:15] Jeremiah Jeremiah
[46:16] &gt;&gt; was Christ in his days with a portion of
[46:20] the word for that day.
[46:23] You are the anointed one
[46:26] of this day. That means in this day you
[46:30] are Christ
[46:32] this day you are God.
[46:37] Amen. But when Jesus came,
[46:42] he came as a redeemer anointed
[46:45] [Music]
[46:46] one
[46:48] one and that was both Moses
[46:52] and all that was in Moses
[46:55] and all the word and all the godheadly
[47:00] was in him.
[47:03] That's the reason the whole temple
[47:07] veil rent
[47:12] and the mercy seat
[47:15] come in a perfect view.
[47:18] He was the anointed one. From that time
[47:23] we have access.
[47:26] Amen. To the mercy seat.
[47:29] We have us access
[47:32] to the most holy place.
[47:36] That is why the Bible here says
[47:40] the mind that was in Christ
[47:44] be in us and who being in the form of
[47:48] God
[47:50] saw it not robbery
[47:53] to be equal with him.
[47:55] As I was saying yesterday, our pastor
[47:58] normally use this word
[48:01] not creation,
[48:02] not formation, but we were processed.
[48:08] Something that you process is something
[48:11] that comes from you.
[48:14] You don't make it. You don't create it,
[48:17] but you take it from you. That is why we
[48:22] talk about the man of God who was sent
[48:27] from
[48:30] from within God. Then he come to us to
[48:34] preach the gospel
[48:36] unto us.
[48:39] Notice now the veil in human flesh
[48:45] the promised way to this age
[48:49] also be veiled.
[48:52] We are the veil that has the word in us.
[48:59] Notice the sin loving church members
[49:06] are and sinners.
[49:09] cannot see it
[49:11] because of the human veil.
[49:18] The wise and the prudent
[49:20] cannot see it. Do you understand? The
[49:24] only people that can see it is those
[49:28] that has the same spirit.
[49:31] As the Bible says, we must do things as
[49:35] we are in one accord.
[49:39] When I speak and you are listening is
[49:42] the deep
[49:44] calling to the deep.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; That's the reason they couldn't see him.
[49:56] Why he's a man?
[50:00] They will ask themselves many question.
[50:02] Where did he come from? What fellowship
[50:05] card does he have?
[50:08] What church does he belong to? What
[50:10] group he belong to?
[50:13] What school did he have? Where did he
[50:16] get his education?
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Well, this man was born.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; According to the tradition
[50:24] according to the legend of him around
[50:26] here. Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; This man was born out of holy wetlock.
[50:35] Amen. Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; But they couldn't see
[50:39] that is God. Those that can see him is
[50:44] those that have the same spirit
[50:47] that is in him because we say Lord Jesus
[50:52] Christ. If it's Lord Jesus Christ and
[50:56] you are the anointed one, that means you
[50:59] are Christ.
[51:00] When you are Christ and the Christ
[51:03] speak, you will say amen because he
[51:06] speaks to you.
[51:09] Amen.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; The only people that can hear and
[51:15] understand the word of God are the one
[51:19] that comes from God.
[51:22] It can't help it. We we are just
[51:25] preaching this evening.
[51:27] But others cannot grab because this
[51:31] weight is not made for them. Those that
[51:35] grab it is made for them and that is
[51:38] life.
[51:41] So notice the veil, the human flesh,
[51:46] you see God in a flesh
[51:50] and you conclude and get convinced that
[51:54] that sister that is walking there
[51:57] is God.
[52:02] Amen. Amen.
[52:05] Now the sin loving people could not see
[52:07] that
[52:09] those traditional religious people
[52:13] they couldn't see that because he was a
[52:15] man
[52:17] the human flesh
[52:20] God
[52:22] when I said
[52:24] is the one that created heaven and earth
[52:28] I'm referring to that
[52:31] God came down and he indwell himself
[52:36] in a human flesh.
[52:40] When you walk
[52:42] when you walk is God walking. When you
[52:46] speak is God speaking. Everything that
[52:50] you do is God doing it in you. You just
[52:55] use your
[52:58] Amen. Amen. We we have seen that with
[53:00] our brother
[53:03] Amen. Amen. H
[53:04] &gt;&gt; he was a kind man indeed.
[53:07] Ever smiling loving all the people. You
[53:10] will think he love you alone. He love I
[53:13] don't know all the people in mood.
[53:16] He knows all of them
[53:18] and he treated them supposedly.
[53:22] Only a person who has the spirit of God
[53:27] can do that.
[53:29] Amen.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; The others will get tired.
[53:35] But if you see someone doing the work he
[53:38] loved the most, he does not get tired.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; But you see what he did
[53:48] so that he could bypass all of them
[53:50] smart
[53:53] wise people. He just re reveal himself
[53:58] like he promised Moses.
[54:01] I'll speak to them through a prophet and
[54:06] he was son of man and a prophet
[54:09] &gt;&gt; and some of them recognize it
[54:12] about 100%
[54:15] of the 100% in the world.
[54:18] They believe it. The rest of them
[54:20] didn't.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; He was just the same.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:28] When God is in a flesh,
[54:32] only few
[54:35] will recognize him.
[54:37] Those that recognize him is those that
[54:41] were with him
[54:43] before the foundation of God.
[54:46] As I normally say, the journey that we
[54:49] are in
[54:51] is not the new journey. We were in
[54:54] heaven.
[54:55] Come here on earth.
[54:57] live a good life at the right time will
[55:01] go back to heaven because those that
[55:04] come from God will go back to God.
[55:09] You know when Jesus was talking about
[55:11] Judas,
[55:13] he said he he he wish
[55:18] he was never born
[55:22] because he was born for damnation.
[55:26] There are certain people that are born
[55:30] to go to hell. Even if you can preach
[55:33] the word of God to them, they will never
[55:36] understand.
[55:38] But we are proud of us today when we
[55:42] talk in the funeral
[55:44] of our brother.
[55:47] Amen. Amen. whom we saw in this world
[55:51] until we say if there is a heaven to go
[55:56] that's where he is.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; A man of God here says, "A type
[56:06] way back when David was leaving the
[56:09] temple,
[56:11] a rejected king
[56:14] went down through the street
[56:17] and a little old up fellow
[56:21] growing along
[56:23] never did like him. He called him old
[56:26] hypogre or something.
[56:28] He spit right on his face.
[56:32] And that God pulled a sword said,
[56:35] "I let that dog head stay on him
[56:39] &gt;&gt; and spit on my king."
[56:42] And then David said, "Let him alone."
[56:46] God told him that.
[56:49] And David probably didn't know what he
[56:50] said.
[56:52] Went up on the mountain, looking back
[56:55] crying.
[56:57] Unlike David because the Bible says, is
[57:01] a man after the heart of God. He was a
[57:05] king in Israel and he was a prophet and
[57:09] in the city of the millennium to come,
[57:12] God is honoring David
[57:16] because David
[57:18] was the man that pleases God. So when he
[57:22] was rejected by the people there, they
[57:25] were spitting on him. They were
[57:27] belittling him. But he was a king. If
[57:31] you are a king, no one can take your
[57:34] kingship.
[57:36] The people will try and do whatever they
[57:40] want. But David was remain like that.
[57:43] Even if he was running up to the
[57:45] mountain, he was running there knowing
[57:48] that he's a king, the rejected king.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the man of God says, "But
[57:57] after 800 years,
[58:00] from there,
[58:02] from there,
[58:04] the son of David was climbing the same
[58:07] mountain that David climbed,
[58:11] looking out, weeping over Jerusalem,
[58:15] a rejected king, and they spit in his
[58:18] face.
[58:20] Don't you see is the same thing?
[58:23] See that word coming down following on
[58:27] today.
[58:29] Always rejected
[58:32] by the majority
[58:34] and believe in the minority.
[58:39] Amen. Amen. David climbed up the
[58:42] mountain with few people because with
[58:46] few people those few people when they
[58:50] look at David they look at Eve as the
[58:53] king. They looked at him as God. That's
[58:58] why always with God is the minority.
[59:04] Those few people are the one that always
[59:08] look up to the right.
[59:11] Many a time the majority
[59:15] is the majority.
[59:18] Some of them they don't understand what
[59:21] they are following but they are just
[59:23] good followers.
[59:24] But with God they give us the
[59:27] understanding.
[59:29] That is why when God is in a flesh we
[59:33] can be able to tell and even say we have
[59:37] seen many people in the message many
[59:40] people in Christianity but this one is a
[59:45] peculiar one.
[59:47] No wonder the Bible says in Israel they
[59:52] had the spirit of God but while having
[59:55] the spirit of God but Joshua and Caleb
[59:59] had another spirit.
[1:00:02] They were above all and the the minority
[1:00:08] were the one that saw what is happening
[1:00:12] Joshua and Caleb.
[1:00:14] The rest receive the wrong report
[1:00:18] from others.
[1:00:21] Amen. And they follow to their
[1:00:24] damnation.
[1:00:26] That is why it was only John who could
[1:00:30] identify the Lord Jesus Christ because
[1:00:34] he saw God whom he worshiped
[1:00:38] condescended upon Jesus. Then he said
[1:00:42] this is the lamb of God.
[1:00:45] Amen.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; But others they still stick to him.
[1:00:51] Even if he point them to Jesus,
[1:00:57] you know they say in life
[1:01:00] a transformation
[1:01:03] or the changes maybe in the companies
[1:01:06] or wherever in life
[1:01:08] are not easily acceptable.
[1:01:12] If the company
[1:01:14] can say we are retrenching,
[1:01:17] we we we are retrenching.
[1:01:20] We
[1:01:22] we need this number
[1:01:25] for certain reason.
[1:01:27] Yeah. You'll see many prayer requests in
[1:01:29] the church
[1:01:32] so that it cannot affect me.
[1:01:35] But a child of God will relax.
[1:01:39] You will say, "Lord God, if you still
[1:01:42] want me to work for this company, I will
[1:01:46] remain. If you want me to get out, it
[1:01:51] will happen." But Lord God, you know
[1:01:54] better. If you just relax as a child,
[1:02:00] have you realized that some of the
[1:02:02] things cannot be changed
[1:02:05] even if you can pray for them and fast
[1:02:09] for them as hard as you can. If God say
[1:02:13] I take you tonight
[1:02:16] and you know about that, you can pray
[1:02:20] until you bleed. But tonight you will
[1:02:22] go.
[1:02:26] God has never made a mistake. He's
[1:02:29] always in time. He knows our
[1:02:33] destination.
[1:02:36] If he knows your destiny, why are you
[1:02:39] worried?
[1:02:41] Just say, Lord God, I don't know why I
[1:02:44] was born. I don't know why I'm here.
[1:02:47] You are the driver of this thing. The
[1:02:50] day I was born and the day I will die,
[1:02:54] you God know it. And my destination
[1:02:59] whether is hell, whether is heaven, I
[1:03:02] cannot go anywhere
[1:03:05] unless the area you have prepared for
[1:03:07] me.
[1:03:09] You know that is God who prepared hell
[1:03:14] is God who prepared heaven.
[1:03:17] God knows who's going to heaven and
[1:03:20] who's going to hell. The people that are
[1:03:23] going to hell, even if
[1:03:28] there will be that are going to hell
[1:03:31] because it's where they belong,
[1:03:36] I want to tell you
[1:03:38] as a as a Christian,
[1:03:40] relax,
[1:03:43] maybe I should repeat it again. Relax.
[1:03:47] Because if you don't relax when we go
[1:03:49] out, you go to the nearest store
[1:03:53] and grand and get grandpa
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; because you're just stressing yourself.
[1:03:59] You are just thinking too much.
[1:04:03] Relax.
[1:04:06] Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; God knows
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; everything
[1:04:16] about us.
[1:04:20] Oh, try and fast and pray harder and go
[1:04:25] to the all night prayer.
[1:04:28] Try it.
[1:04:30] It's not going to help you. A complete
[1:04:33] job was done.
[1:04:34] A complete job was done by God himself.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you see is the same thing? See
[1:04:46] that word coming on down following on
[1:04:50] down today
[1:04:52] always rejected by the majority
[1:04:56] and believe by the minority.
[1:04:59] Remember the son of God was not
[1:05:02] revealed.
[1:05:04] to Sodom two messengers was
[1:05:08] and that's right but God himself reveal
[1:05:12] himself in a human flesh
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; was revealed to Abraham Abraham
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; and watch what
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; he done
[1:05:26] reveal himself again today
[1:05:30] God is revealing himself again today. So
[1:05:34] today the children of God must just
[1:05:37] believe. Abraham for God to visit him.
[1:05:42] He did not fast and pray and pray and
[1:05:46] all those things. He was just sitting
[1:05:50] and God said shalom shalom.
[1:05:56] Then he felt like who
[1:05:59] am I to be visited
[1:06:02] by my God? The one who created the
[1:06:05] heaven and earth. He was walking on the
[1:06:08] on the desert. But he visited my home.
[1:06:13] But the two messengers
[1:06:15] go to and
[1:06:17] for condemnation
[1:06:20] to destroy it. So if on the other side
[1:06:24] God is is destroying
[1:06:27] on the other side God is blessing. Be
[1:06:30] the blessed one. Be the one that God
[1:06:34] will visit when he's destroying the
[1:06:37] world.
[1:06:38] Be like Abraham while you are relaxing
[1:06:41] in the word of God. He he visit you and
[1:06:45] he will say shalom. God today he's
[1:06:48] eating food. He's walking. is waking is
[1:06:53] greeting the people because the end of
[1:06:56] God
[1:06:58] was in a man in our flesh and the man of
[1:07:02] God says our age is so special
[1:07:06] because God shed himself
[1:07:10] us. The children of God incarnate God.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read second Corinthians
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; chapter 4 verse 1-3
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 4 from verse 1 to3
[1:07:42] Therefore seeing we have this mystery as
[1:07:45] we have received mercy we faint not but
[1:07:49] have renounced ounc the hidden things of
[1:07:52] dishonesty,
[1:07:54] not walking in craftness, nor handing
[1:07:57] handling the word of God deceitfully,
[1:08:00] but by manifestation of the truth,
[1:08:03] commending ourselves to every man's
[1:08:05] conscience in the sight of God. But if
[1:08:08] our gospel be he, it is hid to them that
[1:08:11] are lost.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; In whom the God of this world,
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; it's fine. Verse three.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if our gospel be he,
[1:08:20] it is heat to them that are lost.
[1:08:25] And those that are lost are not getting
[1:08:28] lost like now.
[1:08:30] They were lost to begin with. And today
[1:08:35] they will be lost. And after death, they
[1:08:39] will be lost because their destination
[1:08:43] is in prison
[1:08:45] in hell. Amen. That's how it is.
[1:08:50] The stand you took is the stand that
[1:08:53] sustain you today and is the stand that
[1:08:56] will make you reach your destination.
[1:08:59] The Bible says Enoch was a man who
[1:09:04] walked with
[1:09:06] and at the right time he was no more.
[1:09:11] He just walk with God. I want to tell
[1:09:14] you this. Don't even try to say I will
[1:09:17] try harder and read the word of God and
[1:09:20] do this and this. Don't even try.
[1:09:24] Say God do that in me. That's it. He's
[1:09:28] going to take God
[1:09:31] come to you inside you and from that
[1:09:35] time because he's God he will do the
[1:09:38] right thing.
[1:09:39] [Applause]
[1:09:41] I know this young man he had a problem
[1:09:45] with cigarette.
[1:09:48] I stayed with him there in
[1:09:53] I prayed for him to leave cigarette
[1:09:57] tomorrow will come
[1:10:01] pray again.
[1:10:03] I just smoked
[1:10:07] help.
[1:10:13] I just smoked again.
[1:10:16] Then I started to realize
[1:10:18] If someone is of this
[1:10:23] but the day God visit him no one will
[1:10:29] pray for him but God will let him leave
[1:10:33] the cigarette
[1:10:36] and the day he left the cigarette he
[1:10:38] will never want to smoke it again.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; That's how God works. when he visited a
[1:10:48] person that person will never be the
[1:10:51] same as again.
[1:10:54] But sometimes
[1:10:56] because we are human being we are
[1:10:59] parents. We don't want our kids to live
[1:11:02] the wrong way. We will call the elders
[1:11:06] call the pastors. We will pray and take
[1:11:09] for counseling and so forth and so
[1:11:12] forth. But they are not changing. But
[1:11:16] wait until God change their life.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Let God do the thing
[1:11:27] and is the done deal and is God who call
[1:11:32] the people to his word. If you can come
[1:11:36] to the word of God not being called by
[1:11:39] God that's a problem. when I was still
[1:11:43] at school and received the message at
[1:11:46] high school. Then I have that joy and I
[1:11:51] will share it to my brothers, to my
[1:11:53] friends, to my family and others
[1:11:56] followed me. And one of my friends
[1:11:59] follow and follow, follow and follow.
[1:12:02] And then one day he said to me, "My
[1:12:05] friend, sit down and talk." Then I sit
[1:12:08] down, then we talk. He said, "You know
[1:12:11] what? This thing of the word of God or
[1:12:14] this church of God is a is a very good
[1:12:17] church and is taking people to heaven
[1:12:21] and I've seen it and I'm the witness."
[1:12:24] But you know what? It's not for me. So
[1:12:27] my friend, bye-bye.
[1:12:32] Even today, he never get to my church
[1:12:37] since he left that day.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Then I said to him,
[1:12:41] My friend, thanks for being honest.
[1:12:46] Because there are other people you will
[1:12:49] push and push but you are not helping
[1:12:52] yourself. You are not helping them
[1:12:55] because you are pushing but the day God
[1:12:59] comes no longer pushing
[1:13:03] things goes automatically.
[1:13:06] All the people should know their
[1:13:09] standing,
[1:13:11] the word of God because God now has cons
[1:13:15] condescended in the flesh
[1:13:19] of a human being until we can declare
[1:13:23] that this one is going to heaven.
[1:13:26] The word of God brings separation to the
[1:13:29] people
[1:13:31] who are not God incarnate. You are devil
[1:13:34] incarnate.
[1:13:38] There's no neutral place.
[1:13:41] Why are we preaching the gospel? We are
[1:13:44] preaching the gospel as God is using us
[1:13:49] like the mother eagle. So that when I
[1:13:52] preach like this,
[1:13:54] one amongst you,
[1:13:58] I was longing for this kind of a gospel.
[1:14:02] Come to the tabernacle, we baptize you.
[1:14:06] Then we are sure that you follow
[1:14:12] he's in heaven.
[1:14:15] Gone are those days
[1:14:18] whereby we are probing.
[1:14:22] We are not sure but he was good.
[1:14:28] know today we know
[1:14:34] is God who knows.
[1:14:36] Now the Bible is saying who's God?
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; We are God. We are God. We are not the
[1:14:42] creator of heaven and earth. We are him.
[1:14:46] He is us. Because Jesus says he's in us.
[1:14:52] I'm in him. We are in him who is in us.
[1:14:57] We are Christ. We are the anointed one.
[1:15:01] Nothing can shift you from the position
[1:15:05] that God has put you. If you can know
[1:15:08] that, you no longer worry what the
[1:15:11] people say about you. What is the
[1:15:14] condition of life? Just relax upon the
[1:15:17] word of God. Just sing for the Lord.
[1:15:20] Just live for the Lord because you know
[1:15:23] the things of this world that you can
[1:15:25] see with the naked eye, they are all
[1:15:28] temporal, they will all come to an end.
[1:15:31] Now we are looking above our flesh.
[1:15:36] God bless you. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:41] Let's stand to our feet as we sing.
[1:15:46] You can come. Amen. Amen.
