[1:36:33] and went his way but when the blade was
[1:36:36] sprung up and brought forth fruit then
[1:36:40] appeared the test
[1:36:42] also so the Servants of the
[1:36:45] householder came and said unto him sir
[1:36:48] did not thou saw good seed in thy field
[1:36:52] from whence then have it
[1:36:55] t he said unto them an enemy ha done
[1:36:58] this the servant said unto him while
[1:37:02] thou then that we go and gather them up
[1:37:06] but he said Nay last while we gather up
[1:37:10] the test ye root up also the weed with
[1:37:14] them let both grow together until the
[1:37:17] Harvest and in the time of harvest I
[1:37:19] will say to the Reapers Gather ye

[1:37:26] bundles to bur them but gather the wheat

[1:37:47] yourself father God the good thing which
[1:37:50] you have done to us today is giving us a
[1:37:52] gift of life
[1:37:54] now we have come gathered here looking
[1:37:56] for that eternal life be with us Lord
[1:38:00] let our F Finance come closer to us now
[1:38:03] as we'll be listening from the preach to
[1:38:06] us through EOP let the EOP Listen to As
[1:38:09] We committing ourselves into th holy
[1:38:11] hands in Jesus Christ name we pray
[1:38:17] amen my will be this one
[1:38:24] in anding the
[1:38:27] [Music]
[1:38:33] seat you see when you take
[1:38:36] journey in those
[1:38:40] days you were supposed to know the signs
[1:38:44] on the
[1:38:49] road you're supposed to know which sign
[1:38:51] you going to pass before you reach your
[1:38:58] destination then when you have passed
[1:39:00] the first or the
[1:39:03] second then you know that I'm still I'm
[1:39:06] still going to pass the fourth the fifth
[1:39:09] and
[1:39:15] seven that is how we are in this
[1:39:21] journey if you don't know where you are
[1:39:26] you are in
[1:39:28] trouble
[1:39:31] because the
[1:39:36] hares is
[1:39:40] now and the
[1:39:43] harvesting is at the end of
[1:39:50] time and the the G
[1:39:55] because the harvesting is done by the
[1:40:01] kumb and then the
[1:40:05] G is the ging into the
[1:40:12] elevator and the elevator is
[1:40:18] the when God is G
[1:40:24] is using his
[1:40:27] words and the prophet
[1:40:30] says he is
[1:40:33] gathering
[1:40:35] his
[1:40:41] Bri them at a
[1:40:46] place in that
[1:40:50] place when I read
[1:40:54] in this
[1:40:55] book The Prophet
[1:40:58] says he says
[1:41:03] um I'm reading this paragraph in the
[1:41:13] M what time is it that you are living
[1:41:19] in I said go is together
[1:41:24] and he's Gathering
[1:41:26] his his
[1:41:30] bride because his bride is called his
[1:41:34] seat and he's called his
[1:41:38] elect the chosen
[1:41:40] ones that his
[1:41:44] sheep then he's gaing
[1:41:46] them and when he's Gathering
[1:41:49] them Gathering them at a place
[1:41:54] because each and every
[1:41:57] messenger comes at the end of the
[1:42:01] age and calling the people to come out
[1:42:03] of that
[1:42:06] age it means we are also means it means
[1:42:12] our
[1:42:13] messenger has come at the end of this
[1:42:18] age it means you are no more living in
[1:42:20] that age
[1:42:23] because he has called us he has called
[1:42:26] us
[1:42:28] out if we CL that we living in the
[1:42:35] P
[1:42:41] AG means
[1:42:44] confusion you are not
[1:42:48] or that's why the messenger
[1:42:51] came to call us
[1:42:54] out if he has us
[1:42:57] out where are we
[1:43:01] now now the prophet says a time what a
[1:43:07] time is it that we are living
[1:43:11] in he says something like a
[1:43:15] calendar you look at the
[1:43:18] calendar to find out what day of the
[1:43:21] year you are living in
[1:43:27] and you look at God's
[1:43:30] Bible you see what age we are living
[1:43:35] in we are not living in the middle of
[1:43:37] this
[1:43:39] age Baptist age we are living in the
[1:43:44] bright
[1:43:46] age in other words the age Beyond Time
[1:43:53] because seven Church ages is
[1:43:56] time because you count from 1 to
[1:43:59] s that is time then beyond time is the
[1:44:04] bright
[1:44:08] H in
[1:44:10] that you f something
[1:44:15] there then we are living in the bright
[1:44:20] age ping
[1:44:23] bring him
[1:44:24] back to to
[1:44:26] God through a
[1:44:29] channel that is promise to bring it back
[1:44:35] in God is bringing them
[1:44:39] back and when he's bringing
[1:44:41] them is using a
[1:44:45] channel because the channel is already
[1:44:48] there you don't need to look for another
[1:44:53] the prophet
[1:44:54] said to the one who was taking the step
[1:44:57] to the other
[1:45:00] side he said to that that prev of the
[1:45:05] Bride he said to the ones who were
[1:45:08] taking the step
[1:45:11] outside he said to them go back to the
[1:45:15] line because the
[1:45:18] line how was start to move inside the
[1:45:21] line
[1:45:23] not to start another
[1:45:25] L that's why he is bringing them
[1:45:28] back through a
[1:45:32] CH that he has promised to bring it back
[1:45:38] in you cannot be brought
[1:45:41] back in a channel which you don't know
[1:45:47] what we are not brought
[1:45:50] back because you must know
[1:45:54] Channel which
[1:45:56] channel which you are going to be
[1:45:59] brought back
[1:46:01] in he said that channel is
[1:46:05] promised he promised to do
[1:46:09] it he said we are not living in a
[1:46:12] Pentecostal
[1:46:13] age if you look in that in that pyramid
[1:46:17] there then we see the top
[1:46:21] there and above that
[1:46:26] cross there is the bright
[1:46:31] AG is beyond
[1:46:36] time because Beyond
[1:46:39] time is the ministry of the white
[1:46:44] stone because it was the ministry of the
[1:46:50] theop to get the
[1:46:55] Revelation the the the interpretation of
[1:46:57] that W
[1:47:00] Stone to go to the
[1:47:02] west to to
[1:47:05] connect to with the
[1:47:07] the because he got that
[1:47:12] interpretation inside the
[1:47:15] pyramid the Pyramid of the
[1:47:18] angel and those Angel were Celestial
[1:47:22] angel
[1:47:25] then when we reach
[1:47:27] there that is the the dispense another
[1:47:32] dispensation and that dispensation is
[1:47:34] the dispensation of the revelation of
[1:47:37] the son of
[1:47:40] [Applause]
[1:47:43] man that bright
[1:47:46] age is the dispensation of the
[1:47:49] revelation of the son of man
[1:47:54] and if it is the revelation of the if it
[1:47:57] is the dispensation of the revelation of
[1:48:00] the son of
[1:48:02] man it means it's the re it's the
[1:48:05] dispensation of
[1:48:10] M you
[1:48:14] meet in the bright
[1:48:16] age because through seven Church
[1:48:20] ages he came in three son name
[1:48:25] he came as a son of
[1:48:28] man and Son of God he will come son of
[1:48:33] David he will come son of David in the
[1:48:38] millenum in Palestine there when he was
[1:48:41] born there called
[1:48:44] Jesus he was the son of
[1:48:46] man because he said to his
[1:48:50] disciples who do men say I the son of
[1:48:55] men he call himself the son of
[1:49:00] men through seven
[1:49:03] church after his death and
[1:49:06] Resurrection he took another form then
[1:49:09] he came as a Son of
[1:49:12] God through seven Church
[1:49:15] ages he was a Son of
[1:49:18] God no more son
[1:49:20] of but Son of God
[1:49:23] the end
[1:49:25] now come again as a son of
[1:49:30] men where I am now he is the son of
[1:49:34] men he is the son of
[1:49:38] men
[1:49:44] is this what the
[1:49:47] pastor you make form of a prophet
[1:49:55] because the son of man is revealed
[1:49:59] himself through the
[1:50:04] prophet now this age
[1:50:07] here is the age of the revelation of the
[1:50:11] son of
[1:50:13] man is the age of the is the age of the
[1:50:18] eating of the Hidden man
[1:50:23] that is the
[1:50:25] age of the eating
[1:50:29] of the
[1:50:34] food because the prophet
[1:50:36] said you must fit on the
[1:50:44] we now now we are feeding on the bo
[1:50:49] we and if are not feeding on the bo
[1:50:54] M you are not part of the
[1:50:57] Bri because the bright
[1:51:01] now must
[1:51:02] fit on the body
[1:51:05] weight why should he Feit on the body
[1:51:09] weight so that he can be
[1:51:12] ready to
[1:51:14] fly where the carass
[1:51:18] is
[1:51:19] together because the IG must e the
[1:51:24] they must eat the fresh
[1:51:27] meat not the meat which de
[1:51:31] yesterday the me of
[1:51:35] today am the difference between the and
[1:51:39] the
[1:51:42] vulture and the
[1:51:45] vulture is because the Eagles the V are

[1:53:19] together in a place
[1:53:24] we are living
[1:53:26] here to the bright
[1:53:28] age the calling
[1:53:31] out of the church and getting it
[1:53:36] together for the Rapture that is the age
[1:53:40] that you are living
[1:53:41] in now to my honest
[1:53:45] opinion that is exactly the
[1:53:51] truth you see when he was revealing
[1:53:54] himself through seven
[1:53:56] churches he was the son of God and the
[1:54:00] Son of God was the Holy
[1:54:02] Spirit building his
[1:54:05] church when he finished building his
[1:54:08] church then he changed another
[1:54:12] dispensation he was here building his
[1:54:16] church the form of the Holy
[1:54:19] Ghost the rain
[1:54:22] so that the seed must can can germinate
[1:54:26] and
[1:54:29] grow and the end there is no more the
[1:54:32] Holy
[1:54:34] Ghost no more the Son of
[1:54:37] God Chang there but now when you talk
[1:54:41] about the Holy Ghost
[1:54:43] there but you must
[1:54:45] know
[1:54:46] what what is the Holy Ghost
[1:54:53] you must not talk like the you must not
[1:54:56] talk like
[1:54:59] people who who who they don't know where
[1:55:03] the holy ghost is
[1:55:06] now our anointing now it's a different
[1:55:11] anointing it's not like the anointing
[1:55:13] during seven Church
[1:55:22] the anointing is
[1:55:26] different because the anointing of the
[1:55:28] son of
[1:55:30] man it is the pillar of fire
[1:55:33] [Applause]
[1:55:40] anointing during
[1:55:42] 7ch when they were asking you whether
[1:55:45] you are a
[1:55:47] Christian they would say have you
[1:55:49] received the Holy
[1:55:50] Ghost since you
[1:55:53] but it's not the case
[1:55:56] now now when we meet you say have you

[2:26:08] friends I'm a man I can make
[2:26:12] mistake but God being
[2:26:15] God cannot make a
[2:26:18] mistake all the way
[2:26:22] all the
[2:26:23] wordss that has been
[2:26:26] written must be
[2:26:28] fulfilled Jesus said so so we got things
[2:26:33] here in the scripture that must be
[2:26:37] fulfilled and that is one of the
[2:26:40] things this boycot to come you know this
[2:26:44] boy is one of the
[2:26:48] things which is written the
[2:26:51] scripture that must
[2:26:55] come are you with me here let me read
[2:26:59] something here
[2:27:02] first I want to read something
[2:27:06] here it says
[2:27:08] here it is in this
[2:27:11] age that the churches are going to come
[2:27:18] together the L
[2:27:22] and as they are even now controlling the
[2:27:25] world
[2:27:29] politics they will soon control the
[2:27:31] finances of the
[2:27:38] world um and then you will you if you
[2:27:43] don't belong to the world organization
[2:27:48] [Music]
[2:27:51] you will never be able to buy
[2:27:53] or you will lose
[2:27:57] all those who stay true to
[2:28:00] God and keep their garments clean from
[2:28:04] the defilement of the world
[2:28:10] system of church orders of church
[2:28:14] orders will be physically Direct
[2:28:23] there will be presented to them a great
[2:28:29] temptation to give
[2:28:31] in Preachers will give
[2:28:35] in with the
[2:28:38] excuse that they will serve
[2:28:42] God within the framework of the
[2:28:45] Antichrist be system
[2:28:50] they will give
[2:28:52] in will
[2:28:55] [Music]
[2:28:59] give it is already
[2:29:04] formed what it is
[2:29:08] waiting the
[2:29:09] mechanics
[2:29:13] Dynamics when the Dynamics has
[2:29:16] come then it will start his work
[2:29:22] he
[2:29:24] says I read it in the
[2:29:27] middle when it becom so strong
[2:29:33] politically that she best pressure upon
[2:29:35] them the the
[2:29:39] government all to join
[2:29:44] with either directly or through
[2:29:46] adherence to principle
[2:29:52] ined in the
[2:29:54] law so no people will be recognized as
[2:29:58] an actual
[2:30:04] church let me read somewhere above
[2:30:07] there yet from the standpoint of human
[2:30:12] reasoning it will be so very
[2:30:16] right and enlightening
[2:30:20] and giving
[2:30:23] light only the elect will not be
[2:30:30] fooled amen I want read something
[2:30:34] here you can you can be with
[2:30:38] me as this pressure
[2:30:42] increases it
[2:30:44] will it will be hard to
[2:30:48] resist for to resist
[2:30:50] for to
[2:30:51] resist is to lose
[2:30:55] privileges so many will be tempted to
[2:31:01] go for they will feel it
[2:31:06] better to serve God
[2:31:12] publicly in the framework of this
[2:31:17] organization not that not to say God at
[2:31:24] all people will be
[2:31:28] fooled I've got some some hand
[2:31:31] out which I can read them for
[2:31:36] you in South
[2:31:38] Africa they had
[2:31:43] organization the chair person of that
[2:31:45] was a
[2:31:48] woman they said there there are many
[2:31:51] churches they must be
[2:31:55] regulated there are preachers in those
[2:31:58] churches they are they don't have
[2:32:01] qualification but they they are
[2:32:04] preaching they are burying people they
[2:32:07] are marrying people but they are not
[2:32:13] qualified we must go out and look for
[2:32:15] those people
[2:32:21] all right let's pass
[2:32:24] there during that
[2:32:27] time the resurrection will take
[2:32:31] place because the prophet says when the
[2:32:35] when I hear the sound of
[2:32:38] kumbai the
[2:32:40] elevator is
[2:32:43] there when the kumb is doing his

[2:32:57] of
[2:32:59] squee because it is called the squee
[2:33:02] time the resurrection will take
[2:33:06] place someone will be going to the
[2:33:08] pastor's
[2:33:10] house he will
[2:33:13] be you see people will will not
[2:33:18] worry you see if the result will take
[2:33:21] place just
[2:33:24] now people will
[2:33:31] know but if it is during
[2:33:34] that when people are being
[2:33:37] killed when they are when they say they
[2:33:40] are message
[2:33:42] Believers when they don't see you they
[2:33:45] will think you being killed
[2:33:47] [Music]
[2:33:48] [Applause]
[2:33:53] the resurrection will take place during
[2:33:55] that
[2:33:57] time because we meet one
[2:34:00] another before we meet
