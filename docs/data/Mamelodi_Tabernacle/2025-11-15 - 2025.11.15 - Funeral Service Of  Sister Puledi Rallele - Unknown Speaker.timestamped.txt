[1:01:38] leaves behind one sister, eight
[1:01:41] children, 20 grandchildren and 10 greatg
[1:01:46] grandandchildren.
[1:01:47] She went glory on the 3rd of November
[1:01:51] 2025 at Baraguanath Hospital.
[1:02:02] God bless you. You may take your seats.
[1:02:07] Amen. Um, we've come to the most
[1:02:10] important part of the service, the word
[1:02:12] of God.
[1:02:14] Everybody must just stand on their feet
[1:02:17] just uh in respect of the word of God.
[1:02:20] And then we're going to sing a song just
[1:02:23] to welcome the minister of the word.
[1:02:25] Amen.
[1:02:30] Jehovah

[1:05:20] [music]
[1:05:33] brother. The one standing in front of
[1:05:35] you is brother.
[1:05:41] Amen. [laughter]
[1:05:45] So
[1:05:49] it is only the family that is speaking
[1:05:51] today.
[1:05:53] Amen.
[1:05:55] I didn't know that
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; and to comfort ourselves.
[1:06:06] and to know the truth.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; For
[1:06:11] it says, "The truth shall set us free."
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the scripture in the
[1:06:19] book of Job.
[1:06:24] Job chapter 38 verse 17.
[1:06:31] My brother will read the scripture for
[1:06:33] us.
[1:06:37] My elder.
[1:06:47] Amen.
[1:06:52] You can read the scripture.
[1:07:08] Have the gates of death been opened unto
[1:07:11] thee? Or has thou seen the doors of the
[1:07:14] shadow of death?
[1:07:17] As we close our eyes,
[1:07:23] Amen.
[1:07:37] I told you I didn't talk
[1:07:45] with the aim, Lord Almighty,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; and the purpose, gracious Lord,
[1:07:52] the aim and purpose was that the being
[1:07:56] should ser you.
[1:07:59] So we are gathered here as a family,
[1:08:02] as neighbors,
[1:08:04] [music] as friends and even colleagues.
[1:08:09] We are so grateful Lord Almighty to
[1:08:12] serve a wonderful God.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Father, here's my brother here
[1:08:20] and brother Tama standing before this
[1:08:22] congregation.
[1:08:24] to bring the voice of comfort. [music]
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; I commit them unto thee, Lord Almighty.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; And I also commit the family unto thee
[1:08:35] that the word uttered today
[1:08:39] should find a place in their hearts
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; and should be able to comfort them. Lord
[1:08:46] Almighty.
[1:08:49] Thank you, Father. May you anoint my
[1:08:52] brother here.
[1:08:54] May you anoint the ways that have been
[1:08:56] read. May you anoint also his voice,
[1:09:00] Lord. And may may you anoint also our
[1:09:03] ears and even our hearts. Gracious Lord.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, [music] Father. We believe by
[1:09:09] all means
[1:09:11] that you will be the one that comforts
[1:09:13] us. In the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:09:16] Christ, we pray. [music] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:21] God bless you.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:09:29] Uh before we go into our topic,
[1:09:36] I have few scriptures that I want to
[1:09:38] read for the family.
[1:09:45] We will all benefit.
[1:09:52] We have cameras here
[1:09:56] and we are streaming the funeral
[1:09:59] internationally.
[1:10:04] We have people streaming from Malawi.
[1:10:09] We have people streaming from
[1:10:11] Switzerland.
[1:10:15] We have people streaming from the USA.
[1:10:20] It is the reason why we are using two
[1:10:22] languages.
[1:10:26] And beside that,
[1:10:31] I'm from Ptoria Modi.
[1:10:37] Although my parents
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; come from
[1:10:43] neighbor area
[1:10:47] but we have been spoiled
[1:10:52] by staying for quite a long time in
[1:10:54] pritoria.
[1:10:58] So our language
[1:11:01] is not pure.
[1:11:04] If I try to speak,
[1:11:11] I will also be adding some few
[1:11:14] tutorial languages. [snorts]
[1:11:24] Hallelujah.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:27] So our title here
[1:11:31] is the gates of death.
[1:11:35] I want to put it as a question.
[1:11:39] Have the gates of death
[1:11:44] been opened unto thee?
[1:11:48] That means each and every individual
[1:11:50] sitting here,
[1:11:53] there will come a time
[1:11:56] where the gates of death will open
[1:12:02] unto thee.
[1:12:04] And when that gate open,
[1:12:08] you're going to tell us stories.
[1:12:11] Either you will give us a testimony
[1:12:15] or you will be crying
[1:12:17] or you will see strange things.
[1:12:22] But we have people
[1:12:24] that had a privilege
[1:12:28] that these gates were opened for them.
[1:12:34] The gates were open.
[1:12:39] But they came back to tell us
[1:12:42] what they saw.
[1:12:46] One of them
[1:12:49] the gate opened when he was 14 years
[1:12:52] old.
[1:12:56] And at the age of 55,
[1:13:01] he saw the people
[1:13:03] that he saw in hell.
[1:13:06] So when the gates of death opened unto
[1:13:09] him,
[1:13:11] he had the privilege
[1:13:13] at the age of 14
[1:13:16] to go down to hell
[1:13:19] and he saw certain people there.
[1:13:24] And at the age of 54
[1:13:28] when he was sitting at the mall,
[1:13:31] he saw the same people that he saw in
[1:13:34] her.
[1:13:37] up through the escalator.
[1:13:40] Meaning these people as the Bible says
[1:13:44] these are the one that were condemned
[1:13:49] to condemnation
[1:13:54] but we'll come back to that one. There
[1:13:56] are few scriptures I just want to read
[1:13:58] to the family
[1:14:03] and I want to start with Genesis 25.
[1:14:11] The Bible has wonderful scriptures.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; We also call it the love story.
[1:14:22] The Bible has all the answers.
[1:14:26] Amen.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Genesis 25:8.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Abraham gave up the ghost and died
[1:14:38] in a good old age. Abraham,
[1:14:45] an old man,
[1:14:47] and full of years,
[1:14:50] and was gathered to his people.
[1:14:56] You know the Bible says
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; he died in a good old age.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; So some people when they die,
[1:15:11] the Bible says they they die in a good
[1:15:14] old age.
[1:15:17] like our mother here, she died in a good
[1:15:20] old
[1:15:24] scripture,
[1:15:26] you know, when you read read the book of
[1:15:29] Luke,
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; he talks about the beggar,
[1:15:36] he says when the beggar died,
[1:15:39] he was carried by angels
[1:15:43] to paradise.
[1:15:45] But now when we read this book here,
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 46,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 46,
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; verse four,
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; verse four,
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; it says something interesting about the
[1:15:57] old people.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; It says, "And even to your old age,
[1:16:05] I am he
[1:16:09] and even to
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Will I carry you?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Can you read it in?
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah 46.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 46:E4.
[1:16:55] I have made
[1:16:58] and I will bear.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Even I will carry.
[1:17:10] and will deliver you.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; You know there's a scripture that says
[1:17:20] respect your mother and your father so
[1:17:22] that you can live long.
[1:17:24] So when you see a person living long
[1:17:29] then you remember that the scripture
[1:17:31] says
[1:17:33] respect your father,
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; respect your mother so that you can live
[1:17:38] long.
[1:17:40] And if you live in Christ
[1:17:45] in your old age,
[1:17:47] when you die, it is him
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; that will come and carry you
[1:17:55] and deliver you. You see
[1:18:00] in the Old Testament
[1:18:04] when God is pleased with your life
[1:18:09] [clears throat] when you die,
[1:18:12] the angels
[1:18:14] carried you.
[1:18:16] But if you are if God is pleased with
[1:18:19] you
[1:18:22] and you die in your old age
[1:18:26] while you please God,
[1:18:28] He come personally
[1:18:30] to carry you and deliver you. He doesn't
[1:18:35] send angels.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, aren't we glad
[1:18:42] that our mother died in Christ
[1:18:47] and God himself
[1:18:50] had to come to carry him and deliver
[1:18:56] not the angels but God himself.
[1:19:00] Amen. Now, let's go to something else.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; I want us to go to the
[1:19:07] book of Psalms 90.
[1:19:10] verse 12
[1:19:13] verse 12. Before I go into my topic,
[1:19:19] I just want to share with you
[1:19:23] few scriptures.
[1:19:26] My brother, if you can read Bisalum
[1:19:30] 90 verse12,
[1:19:48] The Bible says
[1:19:51] the first wisdom
[1:19:54] is to fear God.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Now it say teach us
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; to number our days
[1:20:03] that we may apply our hearts
[1:20:09] unto wisdom.
[1:20:12] So the only way that we can apply our
[1:20:15] hearts
[1:20:18] Only if we fear God,
[1:20:21] then God will teach us
[1:20:25] to number our days.
[1:20:28] Amen. Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; So we have to number our days.
[1:20:35] But only God can teach us to number our
[1:20:40] days.
[1:20:42] Amen. Let's read another scripture here.
[1:20:46] Ecclesians
[1:20:48] Ecclesians chapter 9:12
[1:20:52] 9:12
[1:20:55] if my brother can find it
[1:21:03] says in my book here
[1:21:08] for man also knoweth not his time.
[1:21:15] So you don't know
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; the time that God will call you home.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; So you cannot postpone the day of your
[1:21:27] salvation
[1:21:31] because
[1:21:32] you don't know your time.
[1:21:37] For man also knoweth not his time.
[1:21:43] The only thing we can ask him
[1:21:47] to teach us
[1:21:49] to number our days. [snorts]
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; But we don't know when we will be
[1:21:56] called.
[1:21:59] Amen.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; So that's why
[1:22:04] we have to repent
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; and live for Christ.
[1:22:13] Let's go to the book of Job. Again,
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; I want us to
[1:22:20] just lay a foundation here.
[1:22:26] Now chapter 7 verse one it says
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Job 7 verse one
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; is there not an appointed time
[1:22:38] to men upon the earth.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Is there not an appointed time to men
[1:22:53] upon the earth?
[1:22:58] So that means each and every one of us
[1:23:02] has an appointment.
[1:23:05] And it says are not his days
[1:23:10] also like the days of a hiring.
[1:23:16] You see when when you get a job,
[1:23:20] you are hired
[1:23:23] and they give you a job description
[1:23:26] and they give you an appointed time.
[1:23:33] So when God brought us here to the
[1:23:35] earth,
[1:23:37] he actually hired us
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; and gave us an appointed time
[1:23:46] and we were hired
[1:23:51] to be the written apostles.
[1:23:58] So when God brought you here,
[1:24:01] he gave you a job description
[1:24:07] and he gave you an appointed time.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; So your job description
[1:24:15] is to serve him.
[1:24:17] Hallelujah.
[1:24:19] If you do other things, that is not why
[1:24:22] you are here on the earth.
[1:24:24] He brought you here,
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; appointed you here for a specific time.
[1:24:32] Amen.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; So, we are saving his time.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go back to our topic.
[1:24:45] Job
[1:24:48] uh 38.
[1:24:51] Job 38 verse 7.
[1:24:54] Verse 17. Yes. Thank you.
[1:24:58] Can you read it again, my brother?
[1:25:09] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:12] Have the gates of death been opened unto
[1:25:16] thee?
[1:25:21] I have a servant of God here.
[1:25:25] And he says
[1:25:28] he was privileged
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; to saw both places.
[1:25:35] You see the the book of Ephesians says
[1:25:42] when a man die
[1:25:45] the spirit goes back to God.
[1:25:49] who gave you.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Now, a person is a a threefold being.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; You are a body,
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; a spirit,
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; and a soul.
[1:26:06] Now, when you die,
[1:26:09] the body goes back to the dust,
[1:26:14] the spirit, goes back to God.
[1:26:18] If you served him well where
[1:26:22] the soul
[1:26:24] goes under the altar
[1:26:28] if you saved him well. If God was
[1:26:31] pleased with your life.
[1:26:34] Now we talk about the souls under the
[1:26:37] altar.
[1:26:40] Now the altar is in the presence of the
[1:26:42] almighty God.
[1:26:45] It is in the sixth dimension.
[1:26:49] But if
[1:26:51] you did not serve him, well,
[1:26:54] you go to a prison house.
[1:26:58] Now that prison house is also called
[1:27:01] hell.
[1:27:04] So when a when the gates of death opens,
[1:27:11] you either see you will see your
[1:27:14] destination.
[1:27:18] When that gate open,
[1:27:21] it's either you will see the sixth
[1:27:24] dimension
[1:27:26] or you will see the prison house
[1:27:30] which is hell.
[1:27:33] Amen.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:27:37] we will touch the issue of the
[1:27:40] resurrection.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Now a man of God says here
[1:27:46] The prophet says,
[1:27:49] "I was privileged
[1:27:52] to see both places
[1:27:56] when that gate opened."
[1:28:00] And he says, "I've been in both places."
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; He was in hell.
[1:28:09] He saw it
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; and he was translated
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; into the sixth dimension
[1:28:17] and he saw it. Now when he went to hell,
[1:28:23] he was traumatized.
[1:28:26] He says, "I was privileged.
[1:28:29] I've been in both places
[1:28:33] and I seen the redeemed in the sixth
[1:28:35] dimension.
[1:28:38] I have seen the lost
[1:28:42] in hell where they were
[1:28:46] and I stand here as your brother today
[1:28:52] warn you to flee
[1:28:55] from the downward path.
[1:29:00] So he is saying don't never go that way.
[1:29:09] Don't never go down to hell.
[1:29:15] When you read the book of Luke,
[1:29:19] when the rich man died,
[1:29:22] he went to hell and he was tormented
[1:29:27] to an extent that he said
[1:29:32] Lazarus
[1:29:34] Lazarus
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; just to deep.
[1:29:38] He just wanted a taste of wood
[1:29:41] because in hell
[1:29:45] is torment after torment.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; So he says don't ever go that route.
[1:29:54] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Far be it from any person
[1:30:02] to enter the region of the Lord.
[1:30:07] If you were standing with hot wires,
[1:30:15] bought through you,
[1:30:18] tormented in every way,
[1:30:22] it will not even be like the torment
[1:30:25] down.
[1:30:30] He he says if you are standing
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; with hot wires
[1:30:37] wired through your body
[1:30:40] and tormented
[1:30:44] that is nothing
[1:30:47] compared to
[1:30:53] that's why he says don't
[1:30:58] is very horrible.
[1:31:01] Don't never go towards that region.
[1:31:08] You can't even take a picture of her
[1:31:13] being that bad.
[1:31:16] And whatever you do,
[1:31:19] don't never go to the rich
[1:31:24] of the Lord.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; And he says,
[1:31:30] When he was 14 years old,
[1:31:33] he was privileged
[1:31:37] to go
[1:31:39] to that region of the lost
[1:31:42] and he saw people there.
[1:31:45] 54 years after
[1:31:49] he saw those people here on the earth,
[1:31:53] same people that he saw in heaven.
[1:31:56] Meaning these people they are here on
[1:31:59] the earth. They are born here on the
[1:32:01] earth but they are represented in hell.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; So this these people the book of Jude
[1:32:14] says
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; they will never
[1:32:19] repent.
[1:32:21] They are born to condemnation
[1:32:25] just like Judas.
[1:32:27] You see Judas was a
[1:32:30] disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; but he was born
[1:32:36] a son of pedition.
[1:32:40] So while he was with the Lord Jesus
[1:32:42] Christ,
[1:32:44] the Lord Jesus was saying this one it
[1:32:47] was better if he was not there.
[1:32:51] because his representation
[1:32:54] was in her.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; So when you have a privilege
[1:33:03] to receive the salvation
[1:33:06] that is the way to go
[1:33:09] and it says the day of salvation is
[1:33:11] today.
[1:33:14] The day of salvation is now.
[1:33:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:33:19] Now the same prophet says
[1:33:25] I was privileged
[1:33:27] to see both sides.
[1:33:30] First he saw he saw the region of the
[1:33:33] lost
[1:33:35] and he says don't ever go that way.
[1:33:40] Then he says
[1:33:44] the other day I was laying on my bed.
[1:33:48] Then the voice asked,
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; "Will you like to see just beyond the
[1:33:53] curtain of time?"
[1:33:58] So when he was 14 years old,
[1:34:02] he was privileged to see downward.
[1:34:08] But later in his years
[1:34:11] he was privileged
[1:34:13] and he was taken beyond the K.
[1:34:18] You see Job asked a question
[1:34:20] if a man died?
[1:34:23] Where will he be?
[1:34:26] What happens? Is he going to be a myth?
[1:34:30] Is he going somewhere?
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Job didn't have an
[1:34:35] answer.
[1:34:37] And the prophet come and says I was
[1:34:40] privileged. A voice asked would you like
[1:34:43] to see just beyond the cinema.
[1:34:46] So he was translated
[1:34:49] to the sixth dimension
[1:34:52] just to go over the altar.
[1:34:58] What happened? I cannot say whether I
[1:35:01] was in the body or out of the body or
[1:35:05] whether it was a translation.
[1:35:08] I do not know.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; But
[1:35:12] when I was translated beyond the curtain
[1:35:14] of time,
[1:35:18] there were great numbers of people
[1:35:22] and they came running to grief.
[1:35:26] You see, when he went down to hell,
[1:35:31] nobody came to greet him
[1:35:35] because everybody was in command.
[1:35:40] Your family cannot welcome you. They in
[1:35:45] down there, your friend down there in
[1:35:49] so there's no way that they can come and
[1:35:51] greet you. They are just screaming and
[1:35:54] shouting.
[1:35:55] And there's no God there.
[1:35:58] But when you are went beyond the c of
[1:36:01] time,
[1:36:05] he was welcomed.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; You see, that's why when you read the
[1:36:11] book of Genesis,
[1:36:14] it says Abraham,
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Abraham,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Abraham,
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Abraham
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; was gathered with his people.
[1:36:25] That means the place that Abraham went,
[1:36:29] he was welcome.
[1:36:32] That means it was a peaceful place.
[1:36:35] But down there, there's no welcoming.
[1:36:41] He just torment.
[1:36:43] But beyond the curtain of time,
[1:36:46] he says, "A great number of people,
[1:36:51] they came running to greet me
[1:36:54] and saying, our precious brother
[1:36:59] and they were young
[1:37:02] and he says they were in their
[1:37:03] brilliance of their youth."
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; And I noticed
[1:37:10] that I too have come here.
[1:37:14] You see down there
[1:37:17] you can never know whether they young or
[1:37:19] old
[1:37:23] they are crying down there
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; but up there
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; they are young.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; And when you arrive there
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; you are welcomed.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:38] Now let's read because we are talking
[1:37:40] about the gates of death.
[1:37:45] You know those people that had a
[1:37:46] privilege
[1:37:48] to be close to the people
[1:37:51] that are dying, they will tell you
[1:37:53] stories.
[1:37:55] Now let's look at Dr. Bosworth.
[1:37:58] Dr. Bosworth. When I heard that he was
[1:38:01] going to meet the Lord,
[1:38:05] I went to see him and I said, "Brother
[1:38:08] Bossworth,
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; are you going to get well?"
[1:38:14] And he said, "I'm just going home."
[1:38:18] When was your happiest time in life,
[1:38:20] brother?
[1:38:24] See, Dr. Bosworth was a very old man.
[1:38:30] So the prophet asked him, "When was your
[1:38:33] happiest time in life?"
[1:38:37] His happiest time was when the gates of
[1:38:42] death opened.
[1:38:44] And he said, "Right now,
[1:38:48] you see, he said that the prophet said,
[1:38:51] "Brother Bos,
[1:38:53] do you know that you are dying?"
[1:38:55] Brother,
[1:38:57] he said I can't die.
[1:39:00] You see a Christian do not die.
[1:39:03] Hallelujah.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; He says I died many years ago.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; I'm watching for him
[1:39:14] to open that door
[1:39:17] at any time and come and get me. Amen.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; He's not waiting for angels.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; He was waiting for him
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; to carry him and deliver him to the
[1:39:32] sixth dimension.
[1:39:34] So his happiest time, he was just
[1:39:36] waiting and watching for him open the
[1:39:41] door.
[1:39:43] Hallelujah. to come and get him to be
[1:39:47] gathered by his people before he died or
[1:39:52] before he went to glory about an hour
[1:39:55] before
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; he started.
[1:40:00] Let me read this. He had been kind of
[1:40:03] asleep for a few hours
[1:40:07] and his wife, his sons,
[1:40:10] standing around.
[1:40:12] An old man woke up.
[1:40:16] When that gate opened, he woke up,
[1:40:21] looked around,
[1:40:23] raised up, and ran across the floor, and
[1:40:27] shook hands
[1:40:29] with his mother, who had been gone for
[1:40:32] many years,
[1:40:34] with his father, for over an hour.
[1:40:40] He shook hands
[1:40:42] with people.
[1:40:44] Oh, this is brother John.
[1:40:46] He came to Christ in my meeting.
[1:40:50] Oh, this is brother so and so thanks
[1:40:54] with his converts
[1:40:57] that has passed
[1:41:01] on for many years.
[1:41:03] I know of an old woman.
[1:41:07] Um
[1:41:09] this woman [clears throat]
[1:41:13] always
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; when they are sitting and
[1:41:19] he will just be pointing at the people
[1:41:21] that he himself can see
[1:41:26] but the other people cannot see. And he
[1:41:29] will be saying
[1:41:32] You so and so
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; don't come here.
[1:41:37] So and so don't come here.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Calling dead people
[1:41:44] and
[1:41:46] people can see that she's scared.
[1:41:49] She has no peace. The only thing that
[1:41:52] she needs is to repent before it's too
[1:41:56] late. Amen.
[1:41:58] Let's read another one here.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln when he was dying
[1:42:10] he was short. He was the president of
[1:42:11] the United States
[1:42:15] and he was a Christian.
[1:42:18] on his
[1:42:20] time of death.
[1:42:23] When he was dying in his bed,
[1:42:27] he said, "Turn my face
[1:42:30] towards the setting of the sun.
[1:42:34] The sun was going down
[1:42:38] and Abraham Lincoln was breathing
[1:42:42] and the blood gougling in his lungs.
[1:42:46] He had trusted God all his life.
[1:42:50] He said, "Hold up my hand."
[1:42:53] And he held his hand.
[1:42:55] So I started praying. Our father who art
[1:42:59] in heaven, hallowed be thy name as he
[1:43:02] bowed his head
[1:43:05] and gave us the ghost. Yeah.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; So when when the gate of death opened,
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; the first thing that came was the Lord's
[1:43:15] prayer.
[1:43:18] Now Dr. Moodi
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; at his death,
[1:43:24] he said,
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; "This is my coronation day."
[1:43:32] Paul,
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; the one that wrote the song Only
[1:43:35] Believe,
[1:43:37] all things.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; When he was on his deathbed,
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; he looked and raised his head
[1:43:52] and he looked at the people in the
[1:43:56] he shook his head and said, "Who is
[1:43:59] dying?"
[1:44:01] You know the people have this tendency
[1:44:04] when a person is about to pass away.
[1:44:07] You know, even the way they walk,
[1:44:09] you know, the way they they respect the
[1:44:12] dead,
[1:44:14] they respect, you know, they go like
[1:44:15] this.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; They referencing themselves.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Even the people that hated the one,
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; they go like that.
[1:44:23] So they were doing that to Paul.
[1:44:27] Then he asked them a question.
[1:44:30] Who is dying here? Is it me or is it?
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; They said
[1:44:38] then he said race cuz they said let us
[1:44:41] close the gate.
[1:44:44] He said no no no no no
[1:44:47] the best thing you can do
[1:44:50] is for you to sing me the resurrection.
[1:44:58] Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Then few minutes, 5 minutes before he
[1:45:02] died,
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; he said to them, "Think of it.
[1:45:08] In the next 5 minutes,
[1:45:11] I will be standing in the presence of
[1:45:13] the Lord Jesus."
[1:45:18] While they were trying to close the
[1:45:19] gates,
[1:45:22] then he said, "Think of it.
[1:45:25] In the next few minutes,
[1:45:27] I'll be standing in his presence.
[1:45:31] You know the prophet Paul
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; when he was ready to die,
[1:45:39] you know, they were fixing to chop off
[1:45:42] his head.
[1:45:47] So he was ready to die
[1:45:51] and he started saying, "Oh grave,
[1:45:56] where is thy victory?
[1:45:59] Death, where is thy state?"
[1:46:03] In other words,
[1:46:05] death, you are coming.
[1:46:07] You are trying to scare me, but you can
[1:46:10] scare me.
[1:46:12] The grave said,
[1:46:14] "I can hold you."
[1:46:18] The grave telling Paul,
[1:46:21] "I can hold you." And Paul looked at it,
[1:46:25] "You can't do it.
[1:46:28] For here in Jerusalem,
[1:46:30] there's an empty tomb.
[1:46:33] You fail to hold the Lord Jesus. How can
[1:46:37] you hold him? I've got the power to
[1:46:40] raise this boy.
[1:46:43] You can't hold me
[1:46:46] death. Where is your sting
[1:46:50] in this hour?
[1:46:52] When he's about to die, he was even
[1:46:54] undermining death.
[1:46:58] Where is your stay?
[1:47:00] Where is your victory?
[1:47:02] You are saying, "Oh, death."
[1:47:05] You know, you are the last enemy to be
[1:47:06] destroyed.
[1:47:08] You can't even hold me. You are nothing.
[1:47:13] in his hour of death.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm not afraid to die
[1:47:20] grave. Show me your victory."
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Because he heard
[1:47:26] the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at the testimony
[1:47:34] of those
[1:47:36] that did not have Christ in their heart.
[1:47:41] There was an infidel by the name of
[1:47:43] Bobinger
[1:47:45] Soul.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; He used to boost around and say there's
[1:47:51] no God.
[1:47:53] He was popular around the television.
[1:47:57] But when that gate of death opened,
[1:48:01] he was in the hospital room.
[1:48:04] He screamed, "Oh God,
[1:48:08] have mercy on my soul."
[1:48:13] Hallelujah. There was another infidel,
[1:48:18] he also boosted and cast,
[1:48:22] saying, "There's no God."
[1:48:24] In his hour of death,
[1:48:27] when the gates of death opened,
[1:48:30] he screamed and cried
[1:48:32] and says, "Yo, I see devils.
[1:48:36] I see chains
[1:48:39] wrapped around him."
[1:48:42] He said, "They coming after me
[1:48:47] until he even said to his children,
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; don't go the way of your father.
[1:48:55] Go the way of your mind
[1:48:58] because he has accepted Christ.
[1:49:01] He was baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:49:03] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:49:07] Even the great queens of England
[1:49:12] when when they were stepping out into
[1:49:14] death,
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; they were screaming.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. M
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; until one said,
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; "If I can have five more minutes
[1:49:29] just to repent,
[1:49:31] but it was too late."
[1:49:34] Oneist who didn't believe in God,
[1:49:40] when that hour came,
[1:49:43] he started screaming,
[1:49:45] "I see two walls.
[1:49:49] And when I scream, it just echo from
[1:49:51] wall to wall.
[1:49:56] Because he kept postponing salvation.
[1:50:02] It's been the fear of men
[1:50:07] all throughout the ages.
[1:50:11] Death. Amen. Even the great scientist,
[1:50:16] even the doctors,
[1:50:18] they can't solve that problem.
[1:50:22] Death,
[1:50:23] they are all scared.
[1:50:26] Let me read the last scripture here.
[1:50:29] Then we will be living.
[1:50:33] Revelation chapter 20
[1:50:37] verse 6.
[1:50:42] Blessed and holy is he that has pardoned
[1:50:44] the first resurrection.
[1:50:47] On such the second death have no power.
[1:50:58] You see this we call it the first death
[1:51:02] is separation from your loved ones.
[1:51:06] But death means separation from your
[1:51:08] loved ones.
[1:51:11] And if you die and you go into the sixth
[1:51:13] dimension,
[1:51:15] then you will come up in the first
[1:51:17] resurrection.
[1:51:20] So our mama,
[1:51:23] the second death has no power.
[1:51:27] So if you fear the first death,
[1:51:31] how much more about the second death?
[1:51:33] Because with the first death, you can
[1:51:36] come up in the first resurrection.
[1:51:38] If you are a Christian,
[1:51:41] you see if you love someone, you want
[1:51:43] them to come up in the first result,
[1:51:46] when you love someone, it's not to buy
[1:51:48] them a present.
[1:51:52] Somebody said, "Oh, this brother love
[1:51:54] his daughter,
[1:51:57] love his son, even bought him a car."
[1:52:01] That's very good.
[1:52:03] Actually, as parents, we must provide.
[1:52:08] But love is to convert
[1:52:12] to Christianity because that one will
[1:52:15] come in the first resurrection and the
[1:52:18] second death will not have power.
[1:52:21] Now let's go to verse
[1:52:24] 14. Verse 14
[1:52:27] uh
[1:52:30] let's start from verse 12 verse 11.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I saw a great white throne,
[1:52:36] and him that sat on it from,
[1:52:40] okay, uh, let's go to verse 12. And I
[1:52:43] saw the dead, small and great, stand
[1:52:47] before God.
[1:52:53] See these ones,
[1:52:55] they came in the second resurrection.
[1:53:00] You see the one that come in the first
[1:53:01] resurrection,
[1:53:03] they are the one that are judging these
[1:53:05] ones
[1:53:08] that are coming before the throne.
[1:53:12] And when they refer to them,
[1:53:15] they say they are the dead.
[1:53:19] That means they don't have hope.
[1:53:22] whether he's a president
[1:53:25] or whether he was a a pope.
[1:53:29] That's why the Bible says great and
[1:53:31] small
[1:53:33] before God and the books were open and
[1:53:36] another book was opened the book of life
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; and the dead.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; You see the people that goes to the
[1:53:44] white throne judgment.
[1:53:47] The Bible don't even call them people.
[1:53:51] It calls them the dead.
[1:53:54] Imagine
[1:53:55] the Bible referring to a person
[1:53:58] coming before the white throne judgment.
[1:54:02] How are you the dead?
[1:54:06] You see they are referred to as the
[1:54:08] dead.
[1:54:10] So don't come to the white throne
[1:54:12] judgment
[1:54:14] because when you come to the white
[1:54:15] throne judgment your neighbor
[1:54:19] will be referring to you. You think here
[1:54:22] on earth he was respecting you as an
[1:54:25] honorable
[1:54:27] member of parliament honorable so
[1:54:32] when it comes to the judgment
[1:54:35] he will call you the dead
[1:54:39] that honorable thing gone
[1:54:42] that title of a doctor
[1:54:48] gone you refer to as the deadual
[1:54:52] Hallelujah.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; And the dead were judged out of those
[1:54:55] things which were
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; and the sea.
[1:55:01] Amen.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; And the sea
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; gave up the dead
[1:55:06] which were in it and death itself and
[1:55:11] hell
[1:55:13] delivered up the dead.
[1:55:16] You see when you die without Christ,
[1:55:20] you go to hell. In the room judgment,
[1:55:24] remember hell is a prison house.
[1:55:27] It brings you, it brings you to the w
[1:55:31] judgment.
[1:55:33] Even hell come with respect.
[1:55:36] He says, Lord Almighty
[1:55:39] here the day.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:46] Even death itself, even the sea, it
[1:55:51] brings their death
[1:55:53] here the day.
[1:55:56] They are called the dead, not people.
[1:56:00] You see, here on earth, we respect
[1:56:01] everyone.
[1:56:03] We call you brother, sister. You know,
[1:56:07] we call you with wonderful names. We
[1:56:09] respect you. But when it comes to the
[1:56:11] white throne judgment,
[1:56:14] if you come before God at the white
[1:56:16] throne judgment, no respect. There's no
[1:56:19] brother dead,
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; just the dead.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Let's read the last verse here
[1:56:29] and death and hell
[1:56:34] were cast into the lake of fire.
[1:56:38] This is the second death.
[1:56:42] He said that prison house that we call
[1:56:45] hell
[1:56:48] after the white throne judgment,
[1:56:51] it is thrown into the lake of fire.
[1:56:56] So it's no longer hell. It goes into the
[1:56:58] lake of fire.
[1:57:01] It goes into the lake of fire.
[1:57:05] And whosoever was not found written in
[1:57:07] the book of life
[1:57:10] broadcast of
[1:57:13] Hallelujah. Let me stop here.
[1:57:17] He say in the resurrection
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; the Bible says
[1:57:24] the spirit will be released from God.
[1:57:29] You see when you died as a Christian the
[1:57:33] spirit goes back to God.
[1:57:36] The body goes to the grave.
[1:57:39] And the soul goes under the sixth
[1:57:42] dimension.
[1:57:43] Now in the resurrection,
[1:57:46] the spirit is released from God.
[1:57:51] You see
[1:57:53] the great teacher says
[1:57:59] when you die and the Bible says so the
[1:58:03] spirit goes back to God.
[1:58:06] You see when the prophet went beyond the
[1:58:08] curtain of
[1:58:11] he said I want to see Jesus
[1:58:14] and they said he's a little bit high
[1:58:17] meaning he's in the seventh dimension
[1:58:21] and he says when you die the spirit goes
[1:58:24] back to God meaning your spirit goes to
[1:58:28] the seventh dimension. So in the
[1:58:30] resurrection he says God will release
[1:58:32] that spirit
[1:58:35] from the seventh dimension. Then it goes
[1:58:37] to the sixth dimension
[1:58:39] to pick up the soul.
[1:58:42] Then it comes here to the earth to pick
[1:58:45] up the substance.
[1:58:47] We should live in.
[1:58:50] That means we are not going to throw
[1:58:52] away the board.
[1:58:55] We are going to lay down because the
[1:58:58] owner of this boat is a young person.
[1:59:02] He's a young woman in the sixth
[1:59:04] dimension. He's going to come back and
[1:59:07] he's going to collect the substance that
[1:59:10] he
[1:59:14] will be in a glorified.
[1:59:18] You see this body is called the
[1:59:20] terrestrial body.
[1:59:22] In the resurrection, the spirit picks up
[1:59:25] the soul.
[1:59:27] Then the soul comes and pick up the
[1:59:29] substance.
[1:59:31] Now it will resurrect as a glorified
[1:59:34] body.
[1:59:37] And it says during the first
[1:59:38] resurrection,
[1:59:40] they will appear unto men.
[1:59:44] They will appear unto men. The people
[1:59:47] that know our mother, they will see her,
[1:59:51] but she will be a young woman.
[1:59:54] So family, if you have a photo of our
[1:59:57] mother
[1:59:59] at the age of 20,
[2:00:02] put it safe because in the resurrection,
[2:00:05] she will come in a glorified
[2:00:08] glorified body as a young woman at the
[2:00:12] age of 20.
[2:00:15] And she will appear unto men
[2:00:18] for 40 days
[2:00:21] before we are also changed.
[2:00:24] and we are going to be with the Lord
[2:00:26] forever.
[2:00:28] And in in the white throne judgment,
[2:00:31] she will be calling others
[2:00:34] that didn't believe the word of God.
[2:00:40] How are you today?
[2:00:42] God bless you. Let us all repent.
[2:00:46] May the Lord richly bless you as we
[2:00:48] stand on our feet.
[2:00:51] I did go beyond my time.
[2:00:54] Please forgive me.
[2:00:56] Let us ask our elder here
[2:01:01] just to come forth and say a word of
[2:01:04] prayer.
[2:01:06] God bless you.
