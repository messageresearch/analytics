[1:26:10] yeah but I can see don't worry yeah yeah
[1:26:13] I want to read this party because
[1:26:20] uh let me read first it says
[1:26:25] no
[1:26:27] with the lamb
[1:26:29] with the book in his hands around
[1:26:34] you know this book
[1:26:37] where was it strong
[1:26:43] oh you don't know oh let's see
[1:26:46] brother where was this book now
[1:26:51] I can't hear you it was with God then
[1:26:55] gave given to Adam
[1:26:58] it was in the hand of Adam
[1:27:02] yes amen why I believe it because now
[1:27:08] I tell you the reason
[1:27:10] why I
[1:27:12] why I know and one what why you know
[1:27:17] you remember when John started to write
[1:27:20] and
[1:27:22] he said don't write someone
[1:27:28] because it was not time for for it
[1:27:34] all right
[1:27:35] I don't know if you
[1:27:38] you will say Amen
[1:27:42] when I say Gregory this book yeah
[1:27:48] it's now in our hands amen
[1:27:54] amen why it was given to Adam because
[1:27:59] it was given to Adam as our marriage
[1:28:03] certificate
[1:28:07] now all the family Mysteries were in
[1:28:11] that book gallery now
[1:28:18] but today
[1:28:19] I don't know if anyone can believe it
[1:28:23] that it is
[1:28:29] amen yeah
[1:28:33] all right
[1:28:34] why I believe that it is this book
[1:28:37] because my name is in this book
[1:28:43] the whole creation
[1:28:47] they were looking probably Village you
[1:28:50] see when it was opened what happened
[1:28:56] right amen
[1:28:59] when it was opened
[1:29:01] the whole Heaven roared Lord
[1:29:06] when they saw the lemon
[1:29:10] coming with the book
[1:29:12] because there was no man Worthy
[1:29:18] Adam has for sale for Has Fallen adamawa
[1:29:23] is so now surely the length of the tribe
[1:29:26] of Judah
[1:29:29] he has won the battle
[1:29:33] amen and was Worthy
[1:29:36] to open the book
[1:29:41] so the whole creation
[1:29:45] they were looking at that book
[1:29:48] but there was no one worthy
[1:29:53] to look into it
[1:29:58] until a Lamborghini
[1:30:02] when John introduced this lamp
[1:30:07] the Lamb of God
[1:30:10] take it away the sin of the world
[1:30:15] he is the wealthy one okay amen
[1:30:21] then what happened when he came with the
[1:30:25] book
[1:30:26] you watch what happened in heaven
[1:30:32] Road
[1:30:35] and John said
[1:30:38] Every Creature heard me already
[1:30:43] foreign
[1:30:50] and even John knew that Johanna my name
[1:30:55] is in that book
[1:30:57] I'm a
[1:31:01] now I read here now
[1:31:05] in this Sevenfold book of seals of
[1:31:08] redemption that the lamb took within
[1:31:12] himself
[1:31:18] took the book foreign
[1:31:50] so the book was in him
[1:31:53] he is the only one who cannot know who
[1:31:56] could do it
[1:31:58] he took it from the right hand of him
[1:32:03] that set upon the throne
[1:32:07] the throne was within him
[1:32:11] as the prophet says
[1:32:22] I'll tell you something the only way God
[1:32:26] can operate
[1:32:29] is from
[1:32:32] the throne
[1:32:34] amen amen now
[1:32:37] you can be a preacher
[1:32:40] unless you are a throne
[1:32:44] amen because
[1:32:47] a preacher Murray is just God's Pulpit
[1:32:51] if
[1:32:53] amen that's a real preacher okay
[1:32:58] now before the king can address the
[1:33:01] subjects
[1:33:14] before he can address
[1:33:21] he spoke to us from history
[1:33:25] now the first rule
[1:33:28] in heaven the second through
[1:33:32] Jesus
[1:33:39] said the prophet of God
[1:33:44] amen amen now usually you never believe
[1:33:48] anything unless it is from the throne
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:53] because he says if
[1:33:58] If Ever I he said if I speak
[1:34:05] that word shall never return to me
[1:34:08] foreign
[1:34:41] then it says and and let us look and
[1:34:45] pass the curtain of time
[1:34:48] because if he opens that book we can
[1:34:53] look our past
[1:34:58] and you see what was there
[1:35:02] and what is here
[1:35:04] because this book was there before
[1:35:09] their Foundation their Foundation okay
[1:35:14] now it carries
[1:35:17] now we can
[1:35:19] what what if he opens the book
[1:35:23] and let us look at past the curtain of
[1:35:26] time
[1:35:27] because if the book is not open
[1:35:30] we still can see but we are on this side
[1:35:34] but when he opens the book we can see a
[1:35:39] paste
[1:35:43] just and
[1:35:45] and
[1:35:56] to bring
[1:35:59] to all his redeemed
[1:36:01] subjects
[1:36:06] to reveal them
[1:36:08] now when we hit
[1:36:11] this in the seals we are going to go
[1:36:16] back
[1:36:18] there and see them songs
[1:36:25] now
[1:36:57] the Bible says Hebrews chapter 9.
[1:37:02] he is the mediator
[1:37:04] of the New Testament
[1:37:09] okay amen now what I'm trying to bring
[1:37:14] this one
[1:37:16] now and his subject
[1:37:20] is them that he has redeemed
[1:37:25] and they cannot come before him until he
[1:37:29] takes the rights of redemption
[1:37:37] he walks
[1:37:39] from
[1:37:42] a mediator
[1:37:45] where death put put us in the Gravely
[1:37:51] he has come forth
[1:37:54] okay amen no
[1:37:58] he he walks forth
[1:38:00] from
[1:38:02] that means from being a mediator
[1:38:06] now I've got so many on this mediation
[1:38:12] Elijah he is no longer a mediator
[1:38:16] after the opening camera of the seventh
[1:38:20] seals and then as he said in that day
[1:38:23] you shall know
[1:38:25] I am in you
[1:38:27] in us
[1:38:33] but when that's why Hebrews chapter 9
[1:38:36] says
[1:38:38] the mediator of the New Testament
[1:38:42] amen but now this is the Seven Seals
[1:38:47] but you know after he opened the seventh
[1:38:51] seal yeah
[1:38:57] when he come the first time
[1:39:01] to them he was not a mediator because he
[1:39:06] was with them
[1:39:07] when he died
[1:39:10] then he became immediate but when he was
[1:39:15] with them
[1:39:17] he was with them
[1:39:20] but when he died
[1:39:22] the Bible says then Hebrews 9 but every
[1:39:26] night he was the mediator of the New
[1:39:29] Testament
[1:39:32] all right amen but here now it says now
[1:39:36] he walks from that far
[1:39:39] meaning he
[1:39:43] he no longer
[1:39:44] a mediator
[1:39:46] he always walk from the the mode then he
[1:39:51] is now in US
[1:39:54] AME
[1:39:56] the seven seal brought him in
[1:40:00] now as he comes in
[1:40:02] no longer immediately
[1:40:05] standing for us again he is with us
[1:40:10] when he is in US is not a mediated
[1:40:16] this is what I see here
[1:40:20] he he yeah he but
[1:40:24] now he come from here at this last seal
[1:40:28] yeah
[1:40:30] he is
[1:40:34] whoa page 83
[1:40:38] one Series
[1:40:40] right amen and there's another many
[1:40:43] books
[1:40:44] saying the same thing is no longer
[1:40:48] mediator we made it because
[1:40:56] okay
[1:40:57] before the opening of the seventh seals
[1:41:02] when he died
[1:41:04] he became our mediator
[1:41:09] but after that
[1:41:12] no longer
[1:41:15] is needed women when he is in you
[1:41:21] when he was with them
[1:41:27] but when he died
[1:41:34] he died for their sins
[1:41:44] I will go to the desire
[1:41:48] Angel's desire to see these things
[1:41:52] that's why when it was open in heaven
[1:41:58] because and they only desired things
[1:42:07] let me read this one here
[1:42:10] firstly
[1:42:12] now we find that whatever is six seals
[1:42:15] has been revealed to us
[1:42:19] we we see it real world and
[1:42:26] let us take it from here
[1:42:29] what is the six seal also
[1:42:33] let me find it opened
[1:42:52] is Moses and Elijah
[1:42:56] they opened the sixth seals
[1:43:02] amen okay amen that the prophet speak
[1:43:06] for himself amen
[1:43:11] 20
[1:43:25] two is a I mean page 20 I can start here
[1:43:30] I saw seven angels in a form of a
[1:43:35] pyramid
[1:43:36] pyramid that swept down and picked me up
[1:43:41] and I was brought East
[1:43:44] to open the seals
[1:43:46] for God
[1:43:48] right while we are waiting there
[1:43:52] I want to say let me read this part
[1:43:58] I was
[1:44:01] foreign
[1:44:30] Moses and Elijah I'm trying to find them
[1:44:34] here I've got three books here let's
[1:44:38] start with them how they say the six was
[1:44:41] opened
[1:44:43] we will see how the seventh was open
[1:44:46] we know how it was opened
[1:44:49] when he stood there
[1:44:55] is standing here to open to us
[1:45:02] and what happened now we are watching
[1:45:06] him
[1:45:10] then he stood up there
[1:45:16] but then suddenly he just said everybody
[1:45:21] quiet now
[1:45:23] that that's how that seal was open
[1:45:26] quiet now
[1:45:28] he said he is here
[1:45:32] he is here to do what right
[1:45:38] and then when he stood like that
[1:45:42] you will start to say all quiet and he
[1:45:46] will start to say then
[1:45:52] we see the special opening up
[1:45:55] it is
[1:46:04] look at it eliminate let me repeat this
[1:46:10] John Johann was a foreign
[1:46:16] unlike the seventh angel messenger
[1:46:21] John could Point him out
[1:46:24] but as a man standing there
[1:46:29] but brother brilliant April Brothers
[1:46:31] stood and say we are now he is here
[1:46:36] um
[1:46:38] he never said behold
[1:46:43] now if he says he is
[1:46:52] then he will start to say
[1:46:56] the opening of the festival
[1:47:01] because it says
[1:47:04] I saw seven angels
[1:47:11] and I was brought East
[1:47:26] the headquarters
[1:47:32] is what in the garden
[1:47:38] he says
[1:47:40] I was brought East
[1:47:43] because when he was in the garden he was
[1:47:48] the god of the Earth
[1:47:50] all of us because he was Eastward
[1:47:53] in the garden that's why before the
[1:47:57] seals were opened man who was brought
[1:48:00] East
[1:48:01] because that way he had the authorities
[1:48:08] in his headquarters which was called The
[1:48:13] Garden of Egypt God was in his
[1:48:16] headquarters
[1:48:35] he could say anything
[1:48:41] amen amen amen there he is
[1:48:48] have you seen what happened
[1:48:50] you look at them
[1:48:53] I learned a lesson with the animals
[1:48:58] I saw one I was with a brother
[1:49:04] he was teaching me to hunt you want to
[1:49:07] talk to hunting with some dogs
[1:49:14] amen so we arrived at the place there
[1:49:18] was an animal
[1:49:20] age now I I want that same but what why
[1:49:25] this animal is not running instead
[1:49:29] it is looking at us
[1:49:32] then I couldn't understand
[1:49:34] I said
[1:49:37] maybe it wants to fight or what
[1:49:40] because it's a small animal like this
[1:49:43] now
[1:49:45] as we were getting closer
[1:49:48] then it came straight towards us yeah
[1:49:52] then I was wondering what's wrong here
[1:49:56] it made it
[1:49:59] past us
[1:50:01] why because carbon
[1:50:04] its house was on the back side of us
[1:50:11] it couldn't run
[1:50:13] directions
[1:50:37] yeah the book was sealed
[1:50:41] was written and on the back side
[1:50:47] now brother Brennan speaks about it
[1:50:50] the backside Ministry
[1:50:54] you go back to the original
[1:50:57] go back from Big to be before the
[1:51:00] fountain foundation of the world
[1:51:03] it is on the back side
[1:51:08] the message is coming from there
[1:51:15] amen amen
[1:51:18] that which was
[1:51:20] from the back side which we have seen
[1:51:25] with which we have stats
[1:51:30] What's the Word of Life silence
[1:51:35] so the ministry that we have the
[1:51:39] backside Ministry
[1:52:04] don't believe any word if it is it was
[1:52:08] not made flesh
[1:52:11] the real word the real pasta real pasta
[1:52:16] the way that is made flesh
[1:52:20] because he doesn't preach himself
[1:52:35] you are also a backside subject
[1:52:40] you are only here that is from The
[1:52:43] Breakfast
[1:52:46] that's why we need pastas
[1:52:51] because they will tell us about it
[1:52:56] which was made flesh
[1:52:59] all right if it is
[1:53:03] a modern Ministry
[1:53:05] we don't need a modern Ministry
[1:53:11] the back side of the book amen
[1:53:19] but now it says terrified
[1:53:24] the silk book
[1:53:27] okay
[1:53:28] this grace mercy upon us to open the
[1:53:32] seventh seals
[1:53:37] to us
[1:53:39] and let us look at level 11 our past or
[1:53:44] fatal you know if that book is opened
[1:53:48] now you can look up past
[1:53:52] that's why he says it was all silence
[1:53:58] and I passed the curtain of time
[1:54:03] seven changes

[2:01:36] Christ means Christian
[2:01:39] anointing culture
[2:01:42] where is Christ is the mystery of my
[2:01:46] brother now Christ the mystery like I

[2:01:52] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[2:01:59] be careful then it never said Jesus

[2:02:34] it was
[2:02:36] and we're friends
[2:02:39] to say Jesus is the Christ foreign

[2:09:22] he could not put something else
[2:09:25] in the place of Adam
[2:09:28] Yet to Come himself

[2:09:35] the Earth
[2:09:39] he could not be replaced to see another
[2:09:43] man
[2:09:45] had to come himself

[2:42:52] this man was going to arrest the
[2:42:54] Christians
[2:42:58] very soon he was called
[2:43:02] let us repeat when he was on his way to
[2:43:06] arrest the Christians what happened God

[2:44:16] uh it is not complete
[2:44:20] reached Adam if it's about to find a
[2:44:24] name the Bible says Adam gives a name to
[2:44:30] that products
[2:44:36] the first amen came from God amen

[2:47:03] foreign
[2:47:42] now
[2:48:11] foreign
[2:48:21] [Music]
[2:48:58] he's coming where if you see what do we
[2:49:01] have the only thing is
[2:49:12] was not genuine

[2:49:17] tell them that which I can't run from
[2:49:21] God Amen
[2:49:25] I mean I mean no that's why
[2:49:30] around

[2:50:07] of faith
[2:50:11] the Lord will give to men

[2:51:34] brother Brendan says
[2:51:47] then he wants you to be one with him
[2:51:52] let me read something here
[2:51:56] [Music]
[2:51:58] foreign
[2:52:20] [Music]
[2:52:29] um
[2:52:30] and what happened
[2:52:32] did not this happened amen
[2:52:37] right
[2:52:40] amen
[2:52:42] whether I say is a vision or what but it
[2:52:45] happened
[2:52:47] I mean
[2:52:51] and they said
[2:52:54] the Bible says
[2:53:01] then we said yes that's how he opened
[2:53:04] amen
[2:53:08] the Bible said people literally
[2:53:10] God said
[2:53:12] I shall come and deliver you looking out
[2:53:17] of the bondage amen
[2:53:26] the thing is how he did that
[2:53:31] local
[2:53:44] while they I we were anticipating
[2:53:48] here come one of their brothers
[2:54:02] then
[2:54:03] the Bible says biblier he preached to
[2:54:07] them
[2:54:08] that was the ministry of Deliverance
[2:54:12] they rejected him they rejected because
[2:54:16] he is a man they're looking at them
[2:54:21] and even
[2:54:22] when they look at himself we've been
[2:54:25] here for many years now this man with
[2:54:28] this dick
[2:54:31] because God when he approached Pharaoh
[2:54:35] you know
[2:54:37] the time he used
[2:54:39] to let my people
[2:54:44] I mean why because
[2:54:48] God said to
[2:54:51] to Moses
[2:54:53] Moses
[2:54:54] I have made you God Amen
[2:55:00] amen God himself
[2:55:09] was a God to Egyptians
[2:55:14] so God challenged him with a god
[2:55:20] if it is God
[2:55:23] the challenge should be performed by
[2:55:26] challenge
[2:55:30] so this God of the Israel from the
[2:55:34] Israelites
[2:55:36] the unveiling of God
[2:55:39] when God was in Moses
[2:55:42] Moses was God
[2:55:45] Amen that's why he said my people
[2:55:52] so even Pharaoh wondered because he said
[2:55:55] let my people
[2:56:00] go Mississippi
[2:56:03] amen amen
[2:56:06] until he stopped him from operating from
[2:56:09] the water America committee
[2:56:14] that was this God
[2:56:17] he closed the Gap there
[2:56:21] foreign
[2:56:52] they didn't know that Moses is God
[2:56:57] because it says when they went to us in
[2:57:01] Moses amen
[2:57:07] is that right now that's why he let them
[2:57:11] out
[2:57:17] and God call it
[2:57:20] calls it the road of God
[2:57:26] a simple rod from a tree but because it
[2:57:30] was in the hand of Moses
[2:57:41] MP3 it's okay
[2:57:47] Egypt okay
[2:57:53] cipila
[2:57:55] then they started off
[2:57:58] but Asia he followed them
[2:58:02] you know after you have
[2:58:05] given your life to God
[2:58:10] don't relax and say Oscar foreign
[2:58:41] and what happened
[2:58:43] and God said Moses Moshe tell the
[2:58:47] children of Israel to go forward
[2:58:53] amen amen so Moses told them until they
[2:58:59] crossed
[2:59:01] all right amen remember but when they
[2:59:05] crossed
[2:59:08] the opportunity
[2:59:12] he also Leonard walked on the
[2:59:16] dry land is that if they can cross
[2:59:23] so they were also
[2:59:26] but what happened right God was watching
[2:59:33] amen amen so they were coming close
[2:59:44] they even saw their eyes looking at them
[2:59:50] because that pillow of light
[2:59:53] came between pharaohs
[2:59:59] you know if you are a child of God
[3:00:02] there is a line between you and Satan
[3:00:10] and Satan cannot touch you
[3:00:15] amen so now we came between
[3:00:19] um
[3:00:24] because they see what the rich the Red
[3:00:29] Sea in what level did not recognize the
[3:00:31] Egyptians
[3:00:35] but with the children of Israelites
[3:00:40] it is said that the sea saw that amen
[3:00:43] the Siri the sea recognize Israel
[3:00:50] did not recognize Pharaoh April whatever
[3:00:54] amen
[3:00:57] at a certain line
[3:00:59] amen amen
[3:01:02] God just unscrew
[3:01:04] the wills of the Chariots You Must Fall
[3:01:07] us
[3:01:16] amen and the children of Israel Israel
[3:01:21] appeared on the other side
[3:01:24] okay amen
[3:01:26] that's how
[3:01:29] but the other thing is when you see that
[3:01:33] when there was pharaohs
[3:01:36] there was the Red Sea how many times you
[3:01:39] find yourself in that situation
[3:01:44] then God said
[3:01:47] go forward
[3:01:49] amen don't discuss about him
[3:01:53] I have delivered to you
[3:01:59] amen
[3:02:00] amen if God has saved you should walk on
[3:02:05] foreign
[3:02:27] a sister came to us I think I was with
[3:02:31] my
