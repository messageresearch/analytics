back tithings back into today and the free offerings that comes deep down from our hearts i would like to thank you for that lord and we are here once again this morning with prayer requests heavenly father knowing further that the promise says by his strives we are healed and gracious heavenly father you said that without faith you cannot please god and we pray lord almighty that may you give us faith god to accept the healings of our bodies that everybody rather that has put on a request concerning any sickness what the prophet has taught us is that all sickness comes from the devil because when you created man he was a perfect man at the end at the end time he said be therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect so with that perfection lord almighty we come to the revealed word we come lord almighty to the revelation of the seventh seed which is the power of gracious heavenly father of the deadpool of which lord you said there's not even a single disease that will stand before it because the word now is in the bride and father we are so blessed to know that we know what to do with that word because we have just said the lord so the lord gave us a promise and we will receive the promise and father will be healed when we receive that promise may you heal them lord almighty so that they should come back lord and bring in thanksgiving gracious lord thank you father as usual we bind all the negative attitude of the devil to bind all the demons that are flittering around gracious lord that causes sickness in a human being so this is the time lord almighty when the power is given to the sons of god the revelations of the sons of god to perform and manifest that power so standing here lord almighty as your servant said the devil is null and void in this building here and all those that have requested the healing of their souls their spirits their bodies father may they receive it in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you some
