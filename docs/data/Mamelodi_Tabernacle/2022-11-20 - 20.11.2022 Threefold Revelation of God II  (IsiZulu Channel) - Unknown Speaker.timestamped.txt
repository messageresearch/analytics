[1:00:44] his name is
[1:00:48] so as he was playing
[1:00:53] and collided with him
[1:00:57] so then he was rushed to the hospital
[1:01:00] now before I can continue
[1:01:03] I'd like to quickly say
[1:01:07] encourage the Believers
[1:01:10] to be
[1:01:14] a man
[1:01:20] my years of being in the message
[1:01:24] I have never
[1:01:26] imagined myself giving such a testimony
[1:01:34] because it actually took me to the Bible
[1:01:44] yeah
[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:52] what happened was he spent seven days at
[1:01:56] the hospital
[1:02:01] he was first admitted to akasia hospital
[1:02:10] realized the his critical condition that
[1:02:13] they sent him to Garden Court in in
[1:02:16] Joins
[1:02:22] seven days
[1:02:32] a
[1:02:44] [Music]
[1:02:51] my wife gave me
[1:02:55] um
[1:03:00] the doctor had just given the families
[1:03:13] to me it was
[1:03:15] I've never seen anyone being raised from
[1:03:18] the dead
[1:03:21] I must admit myself my faith was very
[1:03:25] small
[1:03:30] but I said anyway I'll just talked to
[1:03:32] the pastors
[1:03:39] however this one is very hard
[1:03:44] I told him
[1:03:46] the requests
[1:03:55] [Music]
[1:03:58] I believe that God is with us
[1:04:13] as long as he's in my
[1:04:15] photo is sent to my phone yes
[1:04:22] so I spoke to him
[1:04:25] because I was giving him a report
[1:04:28] so I kept on saying yes
[1:04:39] as long as the pictures
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:51] it moved his hands
[1:04:59] a man
[1:05:02] so the family thought maybe it's just
[1:05:05] reflexes
[1:05:11] on Tuesday
[1:05:13] on the day
[1:05:15] the machine that on that day when the
[1:05:18] machine was supposed to be switched
[1:05:23] then he blinked his eyes
[1:05:29] so
[1:05:34] my little faith just you know went up so
[1:05:40] [Music]
[1:05:41] um then the doctor
[1:05:43] quickly returned and said no I've
[1:05:46] actually ran another test
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:00] [Applause]
