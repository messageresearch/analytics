Description:
Title: Meeting Melchisedec in The Last Days
Preached by Pastor Erastus Makuwa on 20 October 2024 at Mamelodi Tabernacle South Africa

Genesis 14: 14-20 | I Thessalonians 4: 13-18

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about meeting Melchisedec in the last days.

When Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament in a theophany in the person Melchisedec. 

Abraham met Melchizedek when coming from the battle of the kings. Abraham gave Melchizedek tithes of all; in turn Melchizedek gave him bread and wine which was part of Himself.

When he was manifested, he gave the disciples bread and wine. He had no father, but he was the father. If he is the same yesterday, today and forever, it means he is here, and we must find him and see him.

Melchisedec was flesh before Pentecost and He was the morning light.

Pentecost was an altar. what was happening in the Old Testament was fulfilled in the New Testament. In the old it was an image and in the new it was a body of that image.

You cannot meet somebody which you don't know. God chose Abraham to make a nation for himself out of him.

When we fight we fight with scriptures. 

Both the Israelites and Samaritans where waiting for the manifestation of the son of man, Melchisedec. He did not manifest himself to the gentiles because they were not waiting for him.

The bride is now anointed with the logos anointing. We do not need the gifts, but we have the giver of gifts. When you meet Melchizedek you meet the pillar of fire, you meet the anointing.

and when Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto den and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smart them and persuade them unto hobah which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chadum and of the kings that were with him and the at the valley of shave which is the King's D and mlisc king of of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said bless be Abraham of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which ha deliver thine enemies into thine hand and he gave him tithes of all um let's read again the book of Thessalonians chapter first Thessalonians chapter 4 and we read um verse 13 to8 13 to 18 first 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 from verse 13 1 to 18 amen but I will not have you to be ignorant and Brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall de send from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to me the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with this words can brother pray for this amen amen amen amen [Music] amen amen [Music] amen amen amen amen you may take your God bless you I forgotten what told me he said he forgot to introduce [Music] El I am wither God bless and then I forgotten to greet my pastor he's listening my P greeting you we are in the service we are stud amen amen our our topic is me in the last days um I thought but the pastor is listening he will correct it if there is something he wanted to put um you cannot meet somebody you don't know um you must know the person before you can meet him then let me read something here um in this book uh Christ is revealed in his own way he says here when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament as where we have read he said when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament in a theop in the person of MEC not the priesthood but the person the man see for this this man had yet not been born but he was in aop so he had no father and no mother he was God himself he was manifested in the form of a man called the king of Sal which is king of Peace king of righteousness he was when he start he said when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament but where we have read he said he said met Abraham when Abraham was from the Battle of the king but the prophet says he says it was Jesus are you together he was in [Music] a in the form of Amen Abraham gave him ties of his spils and then gave Abraham bread and wi which as we have told he gave him part of himself he gave him Bread and Wine when he was here manifested he gave the disciples and he promised them this is the last one I'm going to eat with you this Bread and Wine in my father's but let's go on here he had neither father nor mother beginning of days or ending of life it was Jesus in a theop in the form of a man could you go to that all right amen Jesus was manifested in the old test in the form of milk in the person mil [Music] the his first being we know it and we have we have preached about it it was the great spirit and that great spirit condescended when it condescended that that is that is the one meet Abraham when that great spirit when when it it formed the theop Theos the of Angel of the Covenant that is what it form what Abraham met that he says here his first being was a spirit God super you cannot meet somebody you don't know I'm trying to introduce him so that you can meet you because you can meet somebody you don't know you will meet a WR person meet the devil and thinking that he is the one he came to Mar I said to Martin worship me I am Jesus he was wearing a thr Mar because he knew scriptures because we fight with scriptures if you don't know scriptures that's why I'm introducing scriptures to you so that you can know how to fight then Martin said leave me Satan we are the ones who going to Crown Jesus why are you already crowned he knew the scripture but if he didn't knew the scripture worshiped sat his first was that gra and he began to form towards flesh we know and in the weight called the weight and the body are you together with now I will get and he says here then then is the state he was when he met Abraham it was called MC it was in the form of aop now we get to that and prove it in a few minutes the Lord willing he was the word are you together with us Abraham meet him we know what happened there and then he gave Abraham part of himself from there we never had anything any more about until he became Jesus are you together with us then he was made actually human flesh when he when he became Jesus and he dwelt Among Us in the person of Jesus the of Christ himself then that is the reason that he called Mary he didn't call Mary his mother he called him woman because was not [Music] this are you together let me read something for you he was there in the beginning we notice now we see why that Mary wasn't his mother that is the reason he called her [Music] woman not mother he had no father he was he was the father the Everlasting father the three in one he had no mother certainly not he had no father he was the father that is the father's name he came [Music] in he said they came in my father's name you receive me not sure he was the same yesterday today and [Music] forever if he was the same yesterday today and for we must look for him and we must see him if he's the same yesterday today and forever means amen let's go on here MC became flesh here I don't know if they can they can put it on my screen my sketch there so that we canc was flesh right was called himself the son of he wasc are you together it was the Morning Light it was the full sea in Palestine there are you with then on the day of Pentecost he he came and distributed himself among them then when he himself among them let me read here now the Loos that was in him in who Jesus which was the spirit of God the anointing through sanctification sanctifying Grace of the blood brought many sons to God which is Anointed with the same L on the day of Pentecost it came down the pillar of fire and broke apart like that tongues of fire set upon each one of them not they are tongues not their Tong but tongues of fire set upon each one of them elected and selected group identify by this Pillar of Fire showing that God had separated himself into man do you get it the logos separating himself into man God not in one person he is in his church Universal is reason Jesus said the work that I do shall you also shall you also more now I know King James says greater in the book of in the book of King James it says greater but the right translation is more then this shall you do God was B and confirmed in one man Jesus Christ but now he is bed and confined in the [Music] whole of the Living God that's why they say this why he say small we can go back to the script on the day of Pentecost the Pentecost was an altar because what happened in the Old Testament it was fulfilled in the New Testament it was manifested it came into being there it was an image but now here it is the the the the of that image that alar in the Old Testament it was a second altar there was there was fire on that Altar and that fire on that altar in the Old Testament in the temple day that fire was B there by God himself and the high priest in order to bend the seven L he was taking the fire from the second altar our second altar is Pentecost this Pentecost p and he will take the fire the high priest and then the first L when the first stand B he will take the fire from that one and bend the second one he don't go back but he start from here and bend this one and take this one and B this and Paul took the fire from this altar his church age are you together with me then he came in three son's name he was the son of man and he was the son of God he was the son of man here but he had to make himself known because we have got three races of [Music] people listen we come from Three Sons of Noah the whole world is populated by these three then we come to this now all those three sons of no their their Generations is called the [Music] Gentiles all this three they are called Gentiles are you together with then God choose from the the generation of Sam choose one day which is abah he wanted to form his own generation the generation of worshipers those who will worship him three they were worshiping Idols but God took one in the form of Abraham and from Abraham God formed his and that nation was called the nation of Israel because they were the sons of Jacob Jacob was called Israel and they were called the the children of Israel because their father was Israel and they became the generation of God the generation which knows who God was and God was their God that's why he called the god of Israel and he wanted to be called like that I am the god of Israel has chosen this group others were Gentiles then there is another group which was between Israelites and the Gentiles that group came out there which was part of Gentiles and part of Israel they were called Samaritans they also claim that God is their God they were also waiting for messiah we have heard from this woman the woman of Samaria he said I perceive that thou are the prophet he was saying to Jesus that you are the prophet you are waiting for he was saying to Jesus that thou are the son of man it means the Israelites and the Samaritans were waiting for the manifestation they were waiting for the Fulfillment of the son of man amen then he revealed himself to them he manifested himself to them but he didn't manifest himself to the Gentiles because the Gentiles were not looking for him but now during the seven Church ages he came there as a Son of God when he was building his church here from the Gentiles because there is the prophet says there was a church there was a tree which is roots is Jewish he was talking about this church here which was been built from the genti but the r the was Jewish when he was building this church he was the son of God he was the water because the Son of God is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the rain watering because it was watering the seed here and because we need water when the seat is still growing when the seat has reached its maturity we don't need any water anymore amen when we have reached that place there at the end of the seven we don't need more we don't need water anymore are you together with me but the problem is when people reach that stage there they need to be transferred to be transferred into this they must be transferred that's why the prophet said I went West after seven I had to went w so that they can be transferred he came here as a natural man explaining these things here but at the end of this he changed to to the supernatural he said I don't know this let me go to the W he said because of this I had to Wi because those he he said I met seven angels there in a supernatural [Music] form in a pyramid form they took me inside of the pyramid where the Mysteries amen he was transferred there then when you fail to be transferred here then you come back here because here is pism because when you have passed year then you are a full seat but when you are a seat you no more need even the gers there even the farmers when they when they have sewn wheat when the time of harvesting they start to stop rain they're fighting with rain they don't want to see anything because the seat has reached maturity where are you now have you fall are you falling back to P amen because if you are not transferred you see nothing if you you become AAL message [Applause] believer you don't know where you are you don't know who you are you are a worshiper of Pentecostalism this age is the last of the seven Church ages he's talking about the which is thean church is the Pentecostal churchur is is the church age which is not warm C it is Aus the church those people that are blind that's why the message came to call me out of this confusion so that I can see where I am so that I can look back oh I shame myor Brothers they are not thought they are not warm you don't know where they are they don't know whether they are women they are men they don't know they don't even know how to wear what is remain just to go naked because they don't they are blind a person who can go out naked is a blind person a person who could see cannot get out of the house naked what began in the first Ephesian church and will come to full fruit and harvest in the or the the two Vines will yeld their final [Music] fruits the true spirits will terminate their manifestation in each of their final destinations the sewing the watering the growing is all over the sewing the watering is all over summer has ended now we are harvesting where are you you don't know where you are you think you are a Pentecostal message the rain is [Music] over the seed has come to majority we don't need any rain anymore the rain has done his work is another church age is the age the dispensation Beyond Time amen and if is beyond time let me just read something here first um the prophet is saying here he's talking about something here believe you are seeing the last thing that will happen to the church you are seeing it do you see the last thing the prophet said I believe you are seeing the last thing that will happen to the church before the rapture that is exactly I believe it the rain is over here where is my picture there the prophet says those who have obtained the message they must they must stay in the Sun to ripen so that the sun can bend their greenness remain in the [Music] Sun so that the son can do his work this is the end time the evening light we are living in the the evening life then the third there this one is the second the first is the son of man the second is the son of then the dispensation of the Holy Spirit what dispensation are we living in when we get to the end there those seven colors must come together the prophet says they are coming together now when they've come together they form the logos the pillar of fire now the anointing now you know the anointing of Jordan Jesus was anointed with the L the the church now the bride now is Anointed with the logos not part we don't need the the gifts we need the giver of the gift we have got the giver if you need gifts go back here we are above they the prophet say and became one because there was a man in the water and God came down said this is my Bel I'm pleased to D he D in then God and Men became one then our Prophet told us God and man now here is one in other words he was telling us the same anointing that was there in Jordan is the same anointing amen when you meet m meet the pillar of fire you meet the theop anointing am the prophet says something inside of me and me I will read for you amen but let me just go on here we said the thir there is the son of David this son of David will be manifested in Millennium Jesus will be the son of David in Millennium that is where will be the son of let me read in this book The Mighty God andil he say here now I think that we find out the CH found out he changing himself what he did if you notice he came in the name of Three Sons he came in the name of the son in the Son of God the son of David came as son of man now son of man means a prophet he had to come that way to fulfill 1815 Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up among you Prophet he never called himself the son of he referred to himself the son of man because he had to come according to the scripture he had to make those two pieces together the Old Testament propy and the and his own character to be exactly the same so he came the son of comeing that form then we find after his dead Resurrection he came on the day of Pentecost Son of God in the spirit in the form of the Holy Ghost what was he doing he was changing himself making himself known to his people in a different form like Holy Spirit which is God he came to deal through church ages Son of God the Holy Spirit but in the Millennium he comes a son of David to set on the throne of King he was to take the Throne of David is on the father's through now then he said he that overcometh he shall set with me on my Throne as I have overcome as I have overcome set on my father's throne in the millenum be the son of D what is it the same God all the time changing his amen but between where is that thing there all right but between between the Son of God and the son of the son of man must reveal himself again amen between the Son
