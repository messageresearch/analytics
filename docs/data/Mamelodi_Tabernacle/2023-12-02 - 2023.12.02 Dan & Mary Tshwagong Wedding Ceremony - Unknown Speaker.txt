me and if not tell me that I may turn to the right hand or to the left then leben and Bethell answered and said the thing proceedeth from the Lord we cannot speak unto the bad or good behold Rebecca is before thee take her and go and let her be thy Master's son's wife as the Lord have spoken and if it came to pass that when Abraham's servant heard their words he worshiped the Lord bowing himself to the earth and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and Remnant and gave them to Rebecca and he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and carried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master and her brother and her mother said let the dumel abide with us a few days at the least 10 amen amen yeah turn to the second scripture uh Matthews Chapter 19 from verse 3-6 the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall live to his wife and they twin shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more twine but one flesh what therefore God has joined together let no men put a God bless you as you take your seat amen amen we are so glad to be here for the wedding of my beloved brother he's been serving for many many years okay amen outside of this years he's been serving for eternity amen amen God bless you now this is the wedding here it started in the house of Abraham this [Music] one amen amen uh the Royal House of Abraham he started right there okay now firstly if we read in this uh book Abraham was old and well strien in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things now you should know that we are the Seed of Abraham the Bible says Christ also is the Seed of Abraham now uh it started there from the seed family right amen what do you expect if a wedding started from the house of Abraham now it says and Abraham Abraham said unto his Elder servant of his house the eldest which we have brother bam as the eldest the seventh one the eldest in the house if you look at the pyramid the house we see the eldest being brother BR okay amen now it was because for God to get his bride he needed the elest in the house to bring the bright now and said Abraham said said unto his eldest servant of his house the house of Abraham yeah and if you look for the third pool you'll find it in the in this house I have found it in this house amen amen uh that ruled over all that he had he put I pray thy hand under my thigh and I will make you s by the Lord the god of Heaven the the god of the earth that thou shall not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but thou sh go unto my country amen amen thou shall not take a wife not meaning that H the messenger here was supposed to take to take is that it's something that is already been prepared for to be taken amen amen what brother B says God matched them them as we know what the Bible says that the woman was created for the man the wife the woman was created for the man especially when she was created already she was created for somebody amen that's why Abraham said go and take he never said go and propose because she is already there planed already because Abraham Abraham uh I mean Isaac is from the Royal seed from the Royal house so be careful if you go to take a wife for Isaac you must make sure this messenger the eldest in the house all right take her she's there already prepared you don't have to worry about many things go and take and the messenger did that when they arrive in the evening time that was in the evening time and stood there by the well now even in time that's when women come to for to collect to draw water that this evening I'll say again and at that time they are not at their best you know after work they take off uh atti the daily attire and they are at home now now you can see they not their best now they are they are on aprons and that's where Al went at that time when they were not at their best if you want to put it that way amen amen and he arrived there in the evening time the messenger and stood there pray to God that I'm here Lord so bless me with this woman okay then she served when he asked for water she started to serve the messenger she started to Ser in the message sent from God Amen amen when go when the man was going down there already there was something happening that woman of all the people who were there she picked up the right messenger and when he said give me water she said for the C as well she started to say and it pleased the messenger so much that it was happening that she was prepared even before amen amen then she he went back to the brothers of Rea right amen not to his friends to the brothers now when when he arrived there the Bible says was in the evening okay and you will realize that when he saw she saw Isaac it was what time in the evening amen amen she was found in the evening and she saw Isaac in the evening when they were coming on C now she said who is that and the messenger said it is my my my my master master [Music] okay amen and that's when she got off the C she didn't know Isaac physically but she knew him through the spoken we amen spoken we no can match things like God amen amen now immediately and the Bible says it was in the from the evening there the [Music] evening then she got off they came in as I said the other time the bride of Christ I think now she's not on a com back when the messenger said say is this the time and they said Christ the mystery of God revealed and the bride of Christ today amen she's no longer only come because the messenger has pointed out says is this the time all right amen and you know some people are still remaining on Camel that's when you haven't seen him but if you have seen him coming you are no longer on the B amen okay amen and is and Rebecca they didn't have cell phones they didn't know each other fa they only received the message because Christ has already prepared and it is is sort of type of a message that will bring them together there the message only reach Rebecca about somebody she has never seen facially she only know the part of that man supposed to be her husband through the spoken Worden he was told about Isaac if one would have said do you know this I that ISAC the theop of this man Isaac had to Feit the theop of this so before they meet in flesh oh she must meet with him first amen before we meet the Lord we must meet with him first through that's why the word says H everything that was created has an has an in that's my Prophet not on and I said oh everything that was created has an end because the Bible says Genesis do you say Genesis or Genesis or Genesis who it says Amen in the beginning God created heaven and earth that is creation then afterwards he said Heaven and Earth shall pass away because they were yes it could confuse somebody a scientist he he just created them now he after that he says they will pass away but you that is in the beginning now there's so many Beginnings another beginning is in the Book of John in the beginning God in the beginning was the way but in the beginning of Genesis is creation and the prophet says everything that was created Shall Pass amen is not what did he say everything that was created has an end has an end but John says in the beginning was the word not creation and the Word was with God and the was God you know you are traveling backward there it was with God [Music] and then from there you'll be getting into the mind of God as the prophet says we you were a and even now the real man I'm talking to it he says what which body is subject to the word did you hear that in your book who is this MC he says the word body subject to the word not this one okay amen now it's ready I'm I will finish right now here it is because you know these are the Royal people you must be careful in dealing with the Royal people amen amen because there we not ANC it is from the mind of God they wedding is from the mind of God it's not ancestral that's right amen you hear it's all just singing I mean they singing here it's not an okay amen let me finish now we thank God that when Rebecca was now uh the the messenger took Rebecca to her brothers now listen what after he he has narrated all Brothers I met your sister the way and this and this has happened he sa even before I said anything amen amen he said also that's how predestinated God amen amen because PR she is predestinated he says give me some water but she says not only but amen do you see that she's [Music] saving chosen out of all the women there at the well okay now to R it what did the brothers say after she narrated the whole thing to them then you listen what they said the brothers then lean and Bethel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the Lord we can but is that where he he said something before they said that ver 49 and now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me amen and if not tell me that I may turn to the right hand or to the left hand then lean and Bethel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the Lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good behold Rebecca is before thee take her and go and let her be thy Master's son's wife as the Lord has spoken what is important here the thing proceeded from the Lord the brothers amen amen they said to the Prophet this thing proceeded from the Lord there's nothing we can say the Lord has done it already how wonderful is it the thing proceeded from the Lord they should know you should know where the thing came from Once you know if the people If Only They knew about this message that this message proceeded from the Lord [Music] [Applause] amen not from a bible school from the Lord we are dealing with things that came from God himself amen or I I if not we are on a mer go if it is not from the Lord if the gospel I preach pre if it is not from we are okay amen that's why brother and God answered him you know amen okay here's the brothers also the thing proceeded from the Lord and then behold Rebecca is before thee okay let's start the them proceeded from the Lord then the the thing proceeded from the Lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good that means there's nothing we can say amen if it is from the Lord there's nothing we can say doesn't means this man Rebecca should be because it is from he yeah it is from the Lord now we as her brothers there's nothing we can say if it was planned by God what can we say take care because it is from the Lord we we can't interfere they don't say this child of us you wanted to be taken by someone who's educated as the people who do today I want my child to be married to a doctor amen now the brother they knew that it is God who has chosen hasband for so let us stand [Applause] back if it is from the Lord let us stand back let God proceed beautiful and then Jo behold old Rebecca is before thee take her and go and let her be thy Master's son's wife as the Lord has spoken as the Lord has spoken the spoken weight is the original seat amen amen now Jo I finish as the Lord take as the Lord has spoken what wedding what marriage the Lord has spoken maybe somebody would ask Brothers are you sure to give away your sister do you know the status of this man no what we know is the Lord has spoken that's just what we know amen we don't know the status we don't know anything about this man we know the spoken that the Lord has [Applause] spoken then that's it that is a genuine marriage after the Lord has spoken you know like today if you put a marriage officer here you must also put Divorce Court they are going together like this but it was not so amen amen it was not so it was straight from the Lord to their wedding day Abraham and Sarah are still together ISAC and his wife are still together because the thing proceed from the law not from is that so let us stand Al and give God leave it in the hands of God let it be it was with God it was planned in the mind of the almighty God it was planned already I can prove to you that it was PL that's why these brothers they said the thing proceeded from not from the meeting let God have his if us as people we could give God and leave God to have his way this world will be a better place why things mix it is because we refusing we are trying to do it ourselves nothing can be perfect perfect that is done by men I can prove to you that you can see a big Highway going this way next month now you see them busy digging the very same but we going to have pipe has to cross this highway [Music] amen that's why God can never give you a plan for divorce even when you pray you say my God it's not my wish it's just the circumstances I'm for you can't preach to God just like who is this woman when the Lord arrive that was Mary and when the Lord arrived Mara started to preach saying Lord if you were here will be fine but if you can ask then the Lord said I am the [Applause] resurrection I'm not Aon on Resurrection I am the resurrection so resurrection and death then don't share the same Throne when the Resurrection comes death has to give way he arrived at the death of that girl it yeah and somebody is it him or Peter people were blocking the way weeping there and he said give give way the resurrection has come amen so the Lord said to Mar I am the resurrection you know you know you know you know about Resurrection from the scriptures but I am it's now the resurrection made flesh and you are talking to the Resurrection now Don't Preach to me I am the resurrection you see that amen because sometimes we try to preach to God you know you know the story The Resurrection as we said recently at the burial of our sister uh let me just that Jesus came as the resurrection to the death of Lazarus are you listening the Resurrection came to the death of Lazarus so Resurrection could not attend the [Applause] feral have you ever seen Resurrection attending a funeral then that's why he ended by saying where have you put he says now that one is yours yeah Resurrection I'm the resurrection where have you put the body the M amen so you know what happen they remaining with the body the cops laar Lazarus yeah Lazarus is coming with Christ Lazarus Lazaro was coming with Christ to his own bones and body and they were there some rolling and crying and so forth then when he arrived there he brought Lazarus to body I won't say take it or leave it but the Lord brought Lazarus because Lazarus the spirit the in in Christ so Lazarus Spirit In Christ and the body is with the then the Lord brought to the amen just to bless them a bit God bless you now finally H that's how they got Rebecca ISAC now Abraham Abraham did not ask for the Isaac did not ask for the photo of Rebecca Rebecca did not ask and said I I hear you you say that man so can I see his photo she didn't ask for a photo she knew that if it is from God then it is [Music] fitting you don't need a photo you you need that word the thing proceed from that's the best photo of photos then if it from the lord it's a perfect but if it is from men then it can be ancestral amen now finally let's wrap with this H that's why now Matthew 19 Matthew 19 they asking a question read it again they ask him a question and that the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall leave to his wife all right amen he didn't say well okay if if if this woman ISO much well maybe he can leave him and like that no uhuh he says did you n did didn't you read he who made them at the beginning made them and female amen amen meaning used to say we should go back amen check from where it came from if it is not from God well it will end up but if it is from God it will save the people because it is God's marriage amen your marriage should be God marriage and he will take care of that marriage it is his if it is a church it should be from it should come from God then he will take care of that church because it is [Applause] his if it is mine I'll plan for it maybe by call many preachers andal every month it will never work if not from [Applause] God it will be a human effort but if it is from God they said if this is from God we there's nothing Brothers I mean there's nothing good yes there's nothing we can say good or B we don't we don't inter it is from the okay amen now can we end up here that's why he said the answer it if if it were a man would say well if he's tring maybe you are struggling if it is from the Lord a situation of that nature can never touch it it is from the Lord if the church I worship him we worship Him from the Lord no Strife no hatred if it is from the Lord because he is the call he is the life of that church the [Music] life amen of that [Music] church that's why people have some meetings of it doesn't come together but if it is from the Lord it doesn't need a mechanic mean right amen that's why we don't go forood St people coming pushing a c and then you are asking for a lift while they are pushing while they busy pushing you are also asking this is my brother we can help you if you can help us push that's why the Church of you see it being pushed it's it's self driving it's automatic it's Auto it's automatic the marriage of is not being pushed it's automatic from God to God Amen [Music] Brethren Jesus Christ let's finish this answer he says why Moses brother Matthews 19:7 they said unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so in the beginning was now if it was not so from the world it w the pur from there in the beginning was the way so we go back to the begin just finish and we finish there wherefore there are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God ha joined together let no man put aand right amen now when God join things it's not when you get married God hased [Music] them and he said the woman was created for the man mhm amen hey the woman was created special God look at the man and said I must created a wife that [Music] man then if it is she is created special for you come and the program because she was created now if you create a wife for the men look at the men then you know how to create what kind of you'll be creating looking at that man said all right this man loves the food now I'll create for a cook I see this man he loves to sleep all the time you see this man you know that's when he start to create for this man looking at their charactertics yes sir how this man behaves and otherwise it won't work amen meeting after still it won't work it is likeing they start by even greeting they greet each other so that they can beat one [Music] another you see now some people they marry they already going to fight M [Music] amen I get surpris when we we struggle to greet one another to love one another when even boxers can even greet each other even after f one with still have one another [Music] even us let's have one another with blue eyes and other [Applause] things and then verse seven they said unto him why did Moses then sorry what that Matthew 19 verse verse 7 then to8 verse six verse verse six wherefore they are no more TW but one flesh what therefore God ha joined together let no man put a son right amen that's it is therefore what [Music] God let no man put us and we know that no man can put that aside because God has put it together all right amen that's it God bless brother Dan and Sister Mary and Sister
