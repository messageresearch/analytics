we have some water tanks can we clap hands for them if everything goes well we won't have water problems amen you know it is so good to fellowship at the place where we have the cons we have the pastor and we have the elders they look after us isn't it [Applause] you know we have this controversial picture it was taken i believe in in congo after the pastor preached while he was seated a sister took that picture and it appears there was some supernatural light around the picture you have that picture isn't it now the pasta has brought it to our attention that we have the correct picture and we have the wrong picture so [Music] there is a wrong one that we distributed some years ago i believe that there is a correct one so the pastor has corrected us and the elders have that correct picture they also have it on their profile pictures even the library is printing that correct picture so if you have the wrong one you have to destroy it and use the correct one god bless you you can check it on the elder's profiles there is a correct one i know that some of you will love that picture god bless you amen may the lord richly bless you amen as we stand on our feet to welcome our precious pastor to the pulpit and sistan godima brought a very wonderful testimony to thank the lord she celebrated her birthday during the course of the week and she just want to thank the lord for all the blessings that she received throughout the years and also want to thank the pastor for him for his prayers [Applause] i heard his father's day today so all the fathers must also thank the

see already [Music] oh [Music] the elders want to welcome all our visitors [Applause] let us welcome our pressure holy cuckoo [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] to the father [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen [Music] um [Music] [Applause] [Music] we want to uh [Music] also because the way it comes in are some dispensations is really humbling gives a cut and i wonder if the brothers have that [Music] chat here the church ages oh okay we'll wait for them so melinda um it's just something autism i would love to show to you guys before we proceed okay but since they are not around i think they are struggling with something back there wrong let us open the scriptures i guess i want us to go back to chapter two of genesis then we'll be saying goodbye to that part two in order to enter into another this is obese [Music] but i'm going to ask the brothers also because i thought about 4240 no this is not the pyramid only for the message yes i always say i am not the only preacher here and young amen god will give them also a share of to share with us we have just quickly decided to instead to switch from guava to is [Music] and chapter two like genesis that asparagus planted a garden actually in god oh yes oh yes you know i was trying to say yes foreign and the seventh church age going beyond that where are you going we are good all right amen just keep that not in your mind but in your heart we are happy let me repeat again we are always supposed to have a gap here good fun and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil let us bow our heads we are starting the service together with you condor the world is not aware of that people of the world are not aware of that we need a campaign they were blinded is [Music] um is they is they don't believe to talk to us very special to us [Music] amen thank you as we open the world yes the future let me read to you last night we were with the brothers again absolutely 4240 now here here at the garden manjala enzyme we hear this this is you have the cherubim oh nama kerobi and you have honor you're right but let me read you about the two young men against [Music] and to find favor with god when they did so come and build an altar eyeball and alter okay everyone then notice in the beginning when the two boys both came king and abel cappella [Music] god [Music] fundamental as the other one is the same thing today coming to the altar both at the you remember the prophet also went eastward [Music] what makes the difference then they both build an altar that would be a church amen to continue now there the bible speaks of the gate today now and this is the gate right here you are swinging like what the prophet says there were some cherubim amen of the tree of life [Music] now if we are in christ we must be christ we are in that way secular you are [Music] of life and then jesus christ is the way oh jesus christ amen if you are not in him you are stationary [Music] we need to to come to the seventh church after you arrived at the seven church ages the seventh church age do you have an answer to that uh um [Music] so okay amen let me come down to this again boys at the east side of the garden you know i always try to preach from the east side we are in the facing prophet the seventh who is condesa to god qualified to get the book was a didn't hand it over to the angels his plan was for a man to keep the men [Music] but it will take somebody predestinated to see each other to another one is just a statement amen let me repeat this again again that's the way god did about the world he worked was [Music] i know these days yes we were being attacked by the devil sister of saturn using his agents and so forth if there's a person here who who doesn't know god the only way to hear the word of god that's when you are the child of god that's the only way otherwise you you you can't hear anything we are in this sanctuary see if you travel back there um the preaching about the coming of the lord was being preached into [Music] for the future [Music] and the people of the next generation the people of the next generation are working father's day today once you are a young man i said this time and again foreign for you who can't the pogies that is the world we are living in a man allow me to repeat again again the food you go to buy a car then well you're telling him is million uh [Music] okay can somebody tell me where where are you amen when a child is born yes there's the goggle there oh when he was young where she was going to hey [Music] [Music] where are you going we are in christ jesus christ all right let me run this quickly again that's the way god did and he he began to bring upon the earth from botany this is not the first time you've heard me reading this oh [Applause] starting with some other i wonder if he has reached you yeah i wonder do you hear what um he followed the pattern of his self who landed because he said let us make men in ours now he started to walk towards that way all right amen while we are struggling to say to the people repent do this do right don't do that don't do that there are some people sisters and god has fashioned out [Music] worshipers but we will see that there's someone who is beyond that who knows all right then it says he began to bring upon the earth something in his own image [Music] there is one still worshipping who know jesus are called church ages he can't be in the same league with the one who is beyond that lawyer don't do that even today a worshiper um there's a time when god was with the people who doesn't when he was not with the people who is even the children of israel when sometimes they would think that god is with them um i've done this i've when he arrives at something he's in his own lap that thing anything that is in the image of god a young kingdom finally [Applause] then that's right i shall build my church is let me take this now again when out cain went out from the presence of the lord at the gate at the garden he was at the gate why is there somewhere and the presence of the lord was there at the gates is so the presence of the lord must have been at the altar and the altar was the gate all right it's god's dwelling place [Applause] [Music] and then they fight them they fought there at the gates um as we are going now the gateway the tree of life amen let me read you something here again church god's church is not isn't it is called not to some station evangelical the church [Applause] this week i'm i'm saying to you come to jesus next week next time i'll be doing that to a newcomer oh we are here some of us have rejected him so you can preach to them we still won't produce any food they have rejected [Music] you can all right you know if i were to ask you about the battle of armageddon [Music] to fight in congo like um united nations i think even now he's trying to do something contact he is mischievous actions doesn't bother him because jesus [Music] with he will never stop [Applause] he is busy hallelujah you know what yes i remember a brother i used to work with you uh we are taught about this seafood god wanted to demonstrate [Applause] he said why didn't god stop him talking about god [Music] god wanted to display to demonstrate um god himself i [Applause] [Applause] we've been struggling here in this church tell us but we can't complain come to our asses as colors but we've been struggling god was satan he's attacking this jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] said stand still almost our team spending and see the salvation of the warnings don't even bother to fight [Applause] we i was dead but now i'm alive gingko fill a watermelon appeal and have the keys footing the petition here's the key satan is without keys i went down to take the keys from him don't worry about satan who has no keys we've got the keys amen amen all right no i'm i'm through with this the answer to the garden of eden and similar eating and then so abel they come here to worship who's allowed the boys come to this gate to worship boys i think we we can see that it's just but king gates here the church ages gates leading to the gate small you have never seen such hatred as we see it today [Music] you see the presence of the lord was but when you have gone past this [Music] i will read you something here i'm not preaching i'm talking about that's why we say re-entry city
