[8:46] I just want to
[8:54] bring a subject a very strong
[9:01] strange subjects
[9:09] amen
[9:17] so I'm going to talk about my Revelation
[9:21] yes amen
[9:28] then while I'm saying my Revelation you
[9:31] also uh
[9:36] after the same way my Revelations
[9:41] [Music]
[9:45] because my Revelation is
[9:52] what God has done for me and to me is
[9:56] what is done to you and for you
[10:06] [Music]
[10:19] he is now at the time
[10:23] of the individuals
[10:26] [Music]
[10:36] now in a group of people John
[10:41] like a church communities and the
[10:45] prophet says we come as individuals
[10:51] [Music]
[10:55] has a place
[10:58] and is a place
[11:03] amen and now we will read how the
[11:07] prophets
[11:10] the message addressing the individuals
[11:19] now
[11:21] I said many times in South Africa
[11:28] you see a group of people singing
[11:34] you'll find that some are not talented
[11:37] they have not seen us
[11:42] but because they sing in a group
[11:47] they all they also shine as good singers
[11:54] amen
[11:57] and uh
[12:00] camera
[12:05] yes we recognize them
[12:09] and put them on a picture
[12:12] they will also appear since
[12:17] but if you can take them one by one
[12:20] message
[12:30] then you realize
[12:35] now you take them individually
[12:40] but if you put them into here
[12:42] they shine together
[12:48] but you call them one by one
[12:51] then you realize
[12:59] so God has done the same thing
[13:02] in the end times
[13:14] [Music]
[13:18] which is individuals it says individual
[13:21] The Prostitute and made the bride of
[13:24] Christ born
[13:30] [Music]
[13:46] it says
[13:49] and unto the angel of the loud on the
[13:52] church on the logician
[13:57] these things
[14:08] because what it is the last Church age
[14:15] amen amen
[14:19] amen means
[14:21] [Music]
[14:24] and he continued and he continued said
[14:28] the amen the faithful and the truth
[14:35] the beginning of the creation of God
[14:39] Amen
[14:44] now we must look at the beginning of the
[14:47] creation of God
[14:52] you always must
[14:55] be a mass cities
[15:05] Christ
[15:07] is being made alone
[15:11] to the church
[15:15] not but no if if he says Christ still
[15:19] decreased uh that means somebody you
[15:24] know SOS may have said before he doesn't
[15:27] say Jesus
[15:29] carefully he doesn't say Jesus
[15:33] he says Christ he decreases we will read
[15:37] it as we carry on it
[15:40] Christ
[15:42] is made no she can't connect
[15:46] Christ in the church Christian is just
[15:50] being made known amen
[15:55] now if we were to
[16:00] ask the sisters and
[16:07] we just
[16:09] take the brothers out
[16:12] and then we ask everything
[16:15] foreign
[16:24] I don't want I don't believe that one
[16:27] sister would pick up somebody else's
[16:29] husband
[16:33] that would mean she doesn't know her
[16:36] husband
[16:38] I believe that each and everyone
[16:41] will say mine is this one
[16:45] million
[16:48] so that's why if I read here
[16:55] okay
[17:12] [Music]
[17:17] now because the the the pride of Christ
[17:20] has
[17:21] is crowned or
[17:25] is kept by Christ foreign
[17:43] [Music]
[18:24] amen now always
[18:27] they put one the first one yeah
[18:34] they make sure they they put somebody
[18:37] faster is
[18:46] the one that will hit the finish line
[18:51] [Music]
[18:53] so he must be very fast
[19:08] and he had to hand it over to another in
[19:12] the second chance
[19:22] but it's always stronger at the end
[19:40] [Music]
[19:55] I don't know
[20:55] the song of
