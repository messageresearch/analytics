certain place somewhere this and that yeah amen you know that yourself don't need to repeat it to you let it be right later then they say I tend to the scriptures for the Heavenly bulletin again when I hear of all these things going around this world only the word of God is my comfort level this three and I had a great voice Out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men yes it is referring to what's going to happen [Music] okay I mean then and he will dwell with them you haven't heard this and they shall be his people it's let me repeat this because we haven't heard it and he will dwell with them uh you know dwelling with him whatever [Music] looking into his face vulnerabilities [Music] touching him one more quiet being been taken by foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay I mean after reading all the things around the world I come to these scriptures then I find comfort amen okay now as yesterday we we said something in this manner that we will look at the back side of the book amen and I'm reading here I'm gonna run quickly they're not willingly we were looking at a book here with my brother Paige 41. I'm thinking of God yeah I'm feeling of God page 41. 41. the unveiling of God okay and the Seven Seals open up the revelation of what that was [Music] on all right I mean so you know as I'm saying people are checking every morning [Music] how their land is performing against Pula or what else say it I mean pound dollar and and all that um [Music] I used to jump into a brother's car hey for some purposes every time I jump into his car is the same thing is amazing [Music] then I realized that the brother one is so occupied with money amen amen every time the news in his car is all about money okay I mean now let's go let's go on now for a few minutes they're not willing actually and knowing that there's all this shall pass away and so much convinced [Music] all these things shall pass our feet that's why you can work and live instead of reading about how the rent is this how they pull like this I come to the scriptures because all that child pass away now if you are looking at me right now we are looking at a figure only passed on a um that will be the news about this body is [Music] if you um if uh that kind of news don't come to you you don't receive that kind of news [Music] foreign amen amen going we are going Jose now let's look at this now I was reading firstly in the book of the prophet of God where it says let us look at past the curtain of time now amen oh man I mean but by saying this you should be talking to a person who who is with you in that journey to [Music] every time we are looking a past regular liability I mean everything we hear about around the world we know that it is okay amen now really uh there was part that I have had somebody was talking um he said always in this way some words in this way man has lost um yes I mean he has lost that because the time that we are living in actually the end of the beginning I'm at home not the beginning of the end it's now the end of the foreign [Music] what it was we used to be like where are we from who are we where are we going that is the real River [Music] the revelation of what I was on amen okay now if you can catch up with the revelation of what you was yeah you won't leave that place okay amen I was a looking at something again here um I think I can find it you know it's two things I would love to pass on to you know like if I have said even before and before that there are things that we preacher and no one will hear them able to understand what we're talking about because as the book of seals says let us look a past the curtain of time oh let me say to him oh okay when you were born there were some promises and predictions made [Music] one would say I live I like I want this child to become this and this and this is and another one would say predictions foreign and the funeral that you see passing down there it came through the very same thing there were some predictions made for him or foreign amen amen while we are going down making some predictions we go down past a funeral procession a reference and also a graveyard that is I hope I'm not disturbing somebody who is preparing for future [Music] that's my peace foreign [Music] all right now answer me foreign I'm looking forward to having a big house take my children to Scotland foreign be very uh if you love this world you don't have the love of God with you [Music] we are this world is not our home we are passing on uh that's who I am and that's who you are if you believe now here is something again here the Lord willing now as the ministry after the seven Church ages the prophet then he said he said really let us look up past the curtain of time because you know I mean now this body is located I mean but there is somebody inside of this body amen amen who has eternal life that's right even Jesus his body was a captain of times that's why when he died but his soul went down [Applause] [Music] [Applause] came back again I was dead but I am now alive forever literally who amen amen and then the Soul is running and he led us through that morion and the Bible says he's the one who went down to the outermost came back to go to when God goes down he really really fast and then he goes out the whole universe some looked at him and said he's got the whole world amen okay amen so let me finish yeah now this Bible the word of God says so you have governors I think it's putting you offline foreign for the first you know they are talking about the Third World War Allah they are talking about now this nowadays the third world now they are saying Barry 90 of the population of America is gonna die Barry ninety percent of America is their prediction about their coming destruction of America okay but even if you can go to America now [Music] you are you will find the people going on with their business all right amen now usually me and you too we were told he has been predicted to us that one day we will pass on but sometimes we are looking at the things of the of this world than the things of the world to come on the new One lyrics One where your body will also be yours one now he has told us here what is going to happen all right amen now I I I I will read this part because we have a messenger the seventh angel messenger and the Bible said behold I will send to Elijah the prophet Elia and he shall tend the hearts of their children back to the hearts of their fathers amen I mean actually this Prophet oh it's not like they're more than Prophet with the water and wool and me what else is [Music] no it's not that Prophet because oil shall pass away [Music] did you know that his fire will even bend water amen amen so there was one time this woman she came with all this stuff oil what water and you buy your healing you know the healing today is not in Jesus time I mean not in Christ's time like we are in Christ's time that's why I can't sell you healing I am in Christ that I try time the opening of the seals uh the opening of the sealsuto [Music] amen the time of Christ amen that's why you are called the bride of Christ he's not alone and the Bible says his pride has made herself ready because she knows that the husband is coming um have you heard of your coming there's no Wars rumors of wars and this is foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] are you ready okay amen now let me read you these few things I am looking at my uh wrist watches I'm looking at my wristwatch yes I mean and the time here all right let me read to you this now really this is foreign [Applause] This Is the End of the beginning okay you have forgotten okay not the beginning of the end is you know the Lord spoke of the beginning how he brought the news to us that let us look up past the curtain of time it's now the big I will failure okay now how can you look to the uh look a past or level of faith a the curtain of time because before there was time an attribute yes I mean an attribute in God before there was time all right I mean now usually now you must look at the beginnings there's one beginning that says in the beginning was the word and there's a beginning that says in the beginning God created but some people are missing here are they still there I mean now you have two beginnings the way that beginning was the beginning of the unfolding the way it was with God the weight was God you know God is a spirit the Bible songs it says no one has seen God at any time all right amen but God started to unfold that's right since in the beginning was the word was made flesh you know that is who came the same way foreign [Music] foreign and they were attributes amen they started to unfold but um now you're you're you're the best by your mother is not your beginning it's not your beginning no I mean is the beginning of your body powerful not yourself I mean it was the body first then the breath when the child is born is just like that everyone available amen amen now then starts the unfolding you will grow hola because your body will age it was for it was born now if you are born of God in Paris that body is not this body [Music] foreign and the Bible says we will hear a man born of a woman has but few days few days that's why when you are born they already started to do some registrations they are thinking of your death now they must join there a policy of what burial what what is um I mean they know that you are born this body is Born to Die so already they prepare for your death and the time of your birth already they prepare prepare for your number that's why we celebrate death but we don't celebrate death days you you know you know let's avoids but the death day we don't celebrate okay I mean although we know that it is coming later I mean did you know that it is coming later all right it's not in our power there's this brother he came to me he said to me um you know every time I I'm going down that road foreign to go and worship his name because he's also late and I said why especially foreign foreign they will fall asleep but wait overlay okay I mean then amen amen it's things like that why because you've got to what we call mind unless that is for this body okay but inside of you there is what we call soon that is another body now listening with your soul the word of God but with your mind that's different I'm finishing now I think we are together I want to read this party which I love so much let me repeat it again so that is this time we'll catch up with what you can search I mean and this is the future who of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Heavenly bride yes the future Revelation

and the new Earth to the old Heaven and the old Earth passed away it is in the Bible heaven has come to resident with men now I repeat it I shall no longer say My Father which is in heaven because all is now coming here amen read again that Revelation 21 verse 9. they came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and rapidly where and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem sending out of Heaven
