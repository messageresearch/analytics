[1:49] nule his own nuclear
[1:51] [Music]

[1:57] something against Iran Russia stands up
[2:00] and he takes note of
[2:07] that and the leader of
[2:11] Iran he calls
[2:14] America the great a big Satan or great
[2:20] Satan and Israel as little
[2:26] Satan that is
[2:28] Iran the leader of of
[2:31] Iran and he
[2:34] said um if ever Iran is
[2:41] attacked we will hit back very
[2:46] hard that is
[2:49] Iran amen amen so you know America looks
[2:53] at this other places like Iran Iraq you

[3:15] doy also threatens
[3:18] [Music]
[3:20] America now
[3:22] Iran this leader said
[3:27] again Israel
[3:30] must
[3:32] be removed of the
[3:38] map
[3:40] amen now the language is the
[3:43] language now he is just a
[3:49] spokesman but the speaker is
[3:57] russan they call it
[4:00] had the great bear bear The Great Bear
[4:05] that now this
[4:09] goog of
[4:11] Ezekiel after the
[4:13] Rapture is referring to the King of the
[4:18] North which is Russia coming up against
[4:25] Israel after the rupture
[4:30] there's some terrible things that are
[4:32] happening during that period 3 and a
[4:34] half
[4:38] years the prophet even
[4:40] says there's some things that are being
[4:43] oppressed because the the Holy Ghost is
[4:46] still
[4:52] here very terrible
[4:56] things and he
[4:58] says but after the
[5:01] Rapture they will
[5:05] surface
[5:07] amen there are even terrible
[5:14] beasts don't don't try to say I'm
[5:16] superstitious they are there are
[5:19] terrible beast and
[5:23] things in the rivers in the
[5:26] mountains but because the children of
[5:28] God are still here
[5:32] [Applause]
[5:34] am they are
[5:38] suppressed amen
[5:41] amen but when the bright
[5:49] leaves the Bible That's why
[5:53] says who unto
[5:57] you the inhabit of the
[6:01] earth and of the
[6:04] sea because Satan is cast
[6:13] down and because he knows this time is
[6:16] very very
[6:19] short but it says Rejoice you in
[6:23] [Applause]
[6:26] heaven now the prophet says that is the
[6:30] raptured Saints today he was talking to
[6:33] the raptured
[6:36] Saints says Rejoice you in
[6:41] heaven because when these things shall
[6:43] take
[6:45] place the bright shall be somewhere
[6:47] [Applause]
[6:50] else all right
[6:54] amen amen so the bride can sing
[6:57] Hallelujah and so forth
[6:59] [Music]
[7:02] amenu for he shall not allow his wife to
[7:06] go through this
[7:11] things amen you just hear of the
[7:16] beast but the tribulation
[7:19] period that is then the time of the
[7:26] Beast amen amen not the mark on
[7:33] youran Amen not the
[7:38] Beast all right amen the Incarnation of
[7:46] Satan and they will just kill and kill
[7:49] and
[7:51] kill to establish a
[7:56] kingdom 3 and a half years
[7:59] that's when the the
[8:02] devil will be trying to establish a
[8:05] kingdom
[8:08] here
[8:10] so all the opposition shall be trembled
[8:17] upon amen that's why the sleeping
[8:22] Vision those who shall miss who will
[8:26] miss the rapture
[8:30] and the the prophet say they will be
[8:32] good
[8:34] people but they will miss the
[8:37] Rapture they were not in the bright
[8:41] material they will be patched through
[8:45] the tribulation
[8:48] period That's when John
[8:51] says who are
[8:54] they amen and they will be given white
[8:57] ropes
[9:00] they will be called out of the
[9:05] tribulation but through they will be
[9:08] patched they'll go through some terrible
[9:13] times but because the prophet
[9:17] says because they treated the children
[9:20] of
[9:22] God
[9:26] well they respect it
[9:31] what God has done in his
[9:34] people they shall be
[9:39] rewarded and that's when it
[9:42] says he shall make them to stand uh like
[9:47] goats on the left hand side and the
[9:50] Sheep on the right hand
[9:55] side and on the right hand side shall
[9:59] say to them for you have seen
[10:02] [Music]
[10:04] me they are they are rewarded because of
[10:07] the good
[10:12] works amen amen and
[10:18] uh and their good
[10:20] behavior so but they will not be the
[10:25] bride even in Jerusalem
[10:31] without amen but they shall come in and
[10:34] out in and
[10:37] out
[10:39] amen because the bride is in the
[10:44] city amen but this good
[10:48] people God shall reward
[10:52] them and at the white Throne
[10:55] judgment he shall say to them
[11:03] um all right let me say the the way the

[16:48] things I'll start
[16:51] here we are on a countown to
[16:55] [Music]
[16:57] crisis the coming nuclear
[17:05] Showdown if I could have things my
[17:09] way I would show you all of you what is
[17:15] nuclear
[17:20] power there's a bomb that destroyed
[17:23] hirosima
[17:25] nasaki that's nothing
[17:32] it goes they say it goes 70 times into
[17:37] one
[17:44] nuclear as the prophet says they are
[17:47] there hanging in the hangers
[17:51] there and yet men go around boasting
[17:59] and they are just
[18:01] there with the names of the
[18:09] [Music]
[18:11] targets if this one was made specially
[18:13] to destroy pror then they
[18:20] wror only one nulear
[18:26] miss can hit
[18:30] Pia and render
[18:36] it into and leave it as
[18:43] smoke going up to
[18:47] heaven
[18:51] one
[18:53] one need needs only one bomb
[19:00] that is what they call nuclear
[19:03] bomb once it drops
[19:07] somewhere it leaves that place upside
[19:11] [Music]
[19:14] down but from that
[19:19] bomb uh a
[19:25] radiation and maybe in the speed of
[19:29] I'll check what
[19:31] this they registered the speed of that
[19:36] radiation reled by the impact of the
[19:42] bomb it is released by the
[19:48] impact that
[19:51] radiation those who are far from
[19:56] pitor they will be destroyed by the
[20:03] radiation amen amen so that is what they
[20:07] call nuclear
[20:12] bomb all right amen now I will read this
[20:16] we close we'll see next
[20:19] time this is a Jewish
[20:21] record this Jewish
[20:24] record we are on account down to crisis
[20:29] the coming nuclear show Down The
[20:32] Showdown with Iran is a
[20:41] certainty the war of Ezekiel 38 to39
[20:45] could begin before this book gets
[20:53] published so although they are not in
[20:56] the bride to know that it's after the
[20:58] Rapture
[21:00] but they know of the certainty of
[21:08] it Israel and America must confront
[21:11] Iran's nuclear
[21:17] ability and their willingness to destroy
[21:19] Israel with nuclear
[21:24] weapons for Israel to wait is to risk
[21:28] committing National
[21:32] [Music]
[21:35] Suicide if they can wait leaving Iran to
[21:39] develop that
[21:42] [Music]
[21:46] bomb it will be a
[21:51] risk amen amen the leaders of the
[21:55] Islamic revolutionary government of Iran
[21:59] are passionate in their hatred for
[22:02] Israel and
[22:11] America no prophetic scripture is more
[22:14] crystal clear than ezekiel's Vivid and
[22:18] specific description of the coming
[22:21] massive war in the middle
[22:25] [Music]
[22:31] in the Middle
[22:32] East E that will sweep the world
[22:43] toward not this hammers when what
[22:48] what they're coming show
[22:55] down amen amen they they know about it
[23:00] the Jews is the Jews here they know of
[23:04] Ezekiel
[23:07] propy and they know that Iran is part of
[23:12] that
[23:13] [Music]
[23:15] prophecy now they
[23:18] say ezekiel's
[23:20] War as described in chapter 38 and 39
[23:24] will consist of Arab collan of Nations
[23:32] [Music]
[23:35] it will consist of
[23:38] Arab coll of
[23:44] Nations led by
[23:48] Russia for the purpose of Exterminating
[23:52] the Jews of Israel and controlling the
[23:56] city of Jerusalem
[24:05] the Russian pay off will be the ability
[24:08] to control the oil Rich paan
[24:21] Gulf this is what the Jews have
[24:26] discovered
[24:30] now now just before we close let me read
[24:32] you something again
[24:34] here H this will be from the same
[24:40] book as I joted some things down
[24:45] here and I will
[24:48] turn back to something uh
[24:55] yeah um
[24:58] I
[25:05] read was it how
[25:08] uh you spell it amen but I will start
[25:12] here I asked the former prime minister
[25:16] where Iran was in
[25:19] its uh development of nuclear weapons
[25:36] admitted that during his
[25:39] administration Israel intelligence had
[25:42] informed the United
[25:53] States Israeli in
[25:56] intelligence informed the United States
[25:59] intelligence community that Iran was
[26:02] working on a medium and long range
[26:05] nuclear
[26:13] [Music]
[26:15] missile that would be capable of hitting
[26:19] London New York and
[26:24] Jerusalem
[26:25] Yem now Mr
[26:29] now continued with a shocking
[26:36] Revelation that the United State
[26:38] intelligence Community was very
[26:40] skeptical of the Israeli
[26:49] intelligence because they know that no
[26:51] one can make a nuclear bomb without the
[26:56] knowledge from either America or Russia
[26:59] or
[27:04] so later Israel intelligence gave
[27:07] photographic proof to the United States
[27:10] intelligence
[27:18] community that Russian scientist who
[27:22] made nuclear weapons for Russia during
[27:25] the Cold War were now
[27:36] employed and we're helping
[27:41] Iran achieve its dream of developing
[27:45] nuclear
[27:49] weapons amen amen so now from
[27:55] there um now
[27:59] confession by father of Pakistan's
[28:01] atomatic
[28:04] [Music]
[28:08] bomb
[28:13] Pakistan that's what Israel considers
[28:16] them to be friends
[28:18] now a scientist Pakistan there's a
[28:21] scientist in Pakistan
[28:29] they in good terms whilst America trusts
[28:32] Pakistan considering them to be their
[28:34] friends this man is an
[28:37] Arab now here is his
[28:41] confession I have sold nule to Libya
[28:45] Iran and North
[28:52] Korea Korea
[28:58] those are the people that America is
[29:00] fighting you know of North Korea and
[29:02] North
[29:05] Korea how when the Iraq War
[29:09] started America was also concerned of
[29:13] the North
[29:15] Korean Korea but North Korea also
[29:19] threatened like Iran North
[29:22] Korea he said should somebody attack us
[29:28] we will chase
[29:30] him catch him and punish him and punish
[29:35] him they were referring to to Bush To
[29:40] America that is North Korea Kore now the
[29:44] knowledge they got from H this father of
[29:49] Pakistan's atomic
[29:57] bomb the article written by Ahmed Rashid
[30:01] confirmed that the father of Pakistan's
[30:03] atomic bomb has confessed to selling
[30:06] nuclear weapons
[30:25] cigarettes so this secret like us as
[30:28] children of God it's not like this if
[30:31] you take the
[30:33] cigarettes and sell
[30:37] them the prophet says it's it's
[30:39] impersonating and it means
[30:47] death what I mean is you come
[30:51] here oh the third pool is this thing
[30:55] and the seventh seal is this
[31:03] and then you start say You Don't Preach
[31:05] well here I'm
[31:07] leing you've got the secrets
[31:10] now you are going to
[31:13] sell now the prophet says you are going
[31:15] to
[31:20] die like you know
[31:24] Pharaoh how they
[31:26] came behind
[31:29] they came
[31:30] behind and when Moses smoke the
[31:35] water and the water
[31:38] parted so Pharaoh's commanders could
[31:42] also read the same thing and all right
[31:44] so how you walk down on the ground uh
[31:48] dry
[31:49] ground the sea
[31:58] it's possible to walk on the dry
[32:01] ground in the mid of the
[32:07] sea so he said to the
[32:11] [Music]
[32:14] Army now
[32:15] listen for a while they walk like Israel
[32:19] on the dry
[32:26] ground Israel was
[32:31] ahead you know with the Thunders the
[32:34] seals the seven pools was
[32:40] ahead you know shoo him from this to
[32:43] that and shooting from that to
[32:46] that Pharaoh's Army enjoyed for a while
[32:51] the dry ground working also
[32:59] amen then the children of
[33:02] Israel they reach the other
[33:08] side and what Egypt thought was
[33:12] also their
[33:14] Ministry swallowed them
[33:22] up it's going to happen like that
[33:27] people they
[33:29] follow the people of
[33:32] God they walk on the dry
[33:37] ground you know between the problems of
[33:39] this world and all those new forms of
[33:42] worship and all those
[33:46] things they
[33:48] also threaten the
[33:52] same but they won't go
[33:55] far the floods are going to
[33:58] swallow them
[34:04] up let me read the last article we'll
[34:07] see next
[34:09] time the admission that
[34:13] Abdul I don't know
[34:17] whether Abdul let's say
[34:21] Abdul Abdul freely sold nuclear
[34:25] technology to Iran Libya and North
[34:33] Korea then I will skip to
[34:37] this officials said that Mr Khan first
[34:41] began to transfer designs drawings and
[34:44] components for
[34:54] guest to Iran
[34:57] between that is for to to to to to uh
[35:01] for them to be able to make a nuclear
[35:05] bomb uh in
[35:07] [Music]
[35:09] 19899 and uh
[35:12] 1991 1991 there is clear evidence that
[35:16] Iran has been seeking to develop nuclear
[35:18] weapons for 20
[35:25] years so Iran can Jews now the Jerusalem
[35:30] Post Bernard headline of AUST
[35:39] 523 bluntly
[35:41] stated bluntly
[35:44] stated Iran can produce nuclear bomb by
[35:47] year
