[8:47] foreign
[9:17] [Music]
[9:35] [Music]
[9:54] foreign
[10:10] [Music]
[10:25] is a dangerous message
[10:28] you are gay
[10:30] driving now
[10:32] we thank God
[10:38] that in all the things that he has done
[10:40] for us okay
[10:42] um
[10:50] and so
[10:52] um
[10:53] he's a a brother back
[10:58] [Music]
[11:05] since ever
[11:07] he worked for what was it here okay
[11:14] amen
[11:16] and he was still a young man and married
[11:19] amen and so we thank God today
[11:25] God is now being served by The Offspring
[11:29] amen Okay so
[11:31] uh we
[11:33] we I sometimes
[11:37] we think that this is the last message
[11:42] uh
[11:44] from God
[11:48] then we wonder again next time there is
[11:51] another service
[11:56] now the prophet says he spoke of The
[12:00] Last Ship
[12:03] foreign
[12:16] [Music]
[12:34] so
[12:35] um
[12:37] this is keeping our time
[12:41] or it's our
[12:44] timepiece
[12:47] if the church only knew its position
[12:55] amen amen
[12:58] now sometimes we go out
[13:02] or to evangelize
[13:06] and but
[13:08] you draw yet we should know our position
[13:14] amen we we should know who we are
[13:19] where we are where are we going where we
[13:24] came from
[13:26] amen so if they change
[13:30] only knew its position
[13:35] and the Rapture will go
[13:40] I mean so uh
[13:43] what's keeping the Rapture and not to go
[13:46] yeah
[13:51] something
[13:52] in the bride of Christ
[13:55] okay
[13:58] let me read to you what I'm going to
[14:01] speak of
[14:03] the Prophet says
[14:06] now all right let me start by reading
[14:10] this part
[14:11] we are we are just going briefly to talk
[14:15] about something here
[14:19] um
[14:19] I'm glad I believe a brother wise
[14:23] introduced this morning
[14:30] the brother who came and said that I
[14:32] want to serve my God now
[14:37] and I've been away
[14:41] because you know if you are a child of
[14:43] God
[14:47] you can go very far
[14:49] but God will still
[14:52] restore you
[14:54] amen amen
[14:57] so that's why we as the children of God
[15:02] are we judge no man
[15:06] the judge is God
[15:10] if somebody comes
[15:13] I'm sick we don't ask him questions
[15:18] where do you worship
[15:21] there's a mother I don't know if
[15:25] I I don't think she's here
[15:29] she came yesterday I was your brothers
[15:35] and she was the last person to
[15:39] uh
[15:50] our difficult news about it
[15:53] so I said
[15:57] I said you are a pentagon and he said
[16:01] yes and
[16:03] yes and she she prayed
[16:05] for her condition
[16:08] so I pray for him
[16:13] amen amen because in praying for the
[16:16] sick
[16:17] you don't pray for somebody who is with
[16:21] you in the faith
[16:26] only pray for that particular person
[16:30] because he's with you
[16:35] pray for everybody
[16:38] amen amen and a prayer of faith
[16:43] but I'm glad I don't know if this mama
[16:46] that Mama is here
[16:48] but when she left
[16:51] then she she she she turned this way and
[16:56] that way
[17:00] amen so he said God bless you
[17:05] amen amen
[17:07] so there is power in the world
[17:12] says
[17:14] the word of God is your healer
[17:20] amen amen then
[17:24] there was another sister yesterday and
[18:25] I said because we have prayed for so
[18:28] many people
[18:30] with some kind of disease
[18:33] and people don't know
[18:38] the conditions that people were found to
[18:42] be Liam
[18:44] and they are today
[18:48] and there's no witness to that
[18:52] so this day we need to have a witness
[18:56] every time
[19:03] amen amen I saw uh God bless you this is
[19:08] what I'm trying to talk about
[19:11] God dwells in a stature of Amen
[19:17] now let me read it to you
[19:19] because you know before you can worship
[19:23] God
[19:25] you should know who he is
[19:28] and the way he is
[19:32] because see if you don't know where God
[19:34] is
[19:36] you can just bow on your knees anywhere
[19:42] and that's why the Lord Jesus said to
[19:45] the Samaritan
[19:47] you worship but you don't know why
[19:52] because salvation is of the Jews
[19:57] so that means they worship in vain
[20:01] but he said but now the time has come
[20:06] the true worshipers shall worship God
[20:15] worship God in spirit
[20:20] amen amen
[20:22] it says here I am
[20:25] it's a quotation from the stature of a
[20:28] perfect man from the station of the
[20:31] amen now
[20:33] perfect men
[20:38] says as we were taught that Perfection
[20:42] is in three years
[20:48] three is the number of Perfections
[20:53] then in my Hebrew Book I don't have it
[20:56] yet
[20:57] he says
[20:59] life is in the third
[21:04] amen amen then he goes to a book of
[21:08] Genesis chapter one
[21:10] he says chapter
[21:13] I mean that is verse three well he will
[21:17] move verse three uh he speaks of how God
[21:20] coming down separating water from water
[21:25] Darkness
[21:29] finally he reached the dry ground
[21:34] and he said let the Earth bring forth
[21:37] literally and so surely he calls also
[21:43] verse 11.
[21:45] yeah that is verse 11. okay verse 11
[21:47] years it says let every tree or plant
[21:51] bring forth of its kind simulation
[21:56] amen amen so uh that that's life
[22:02] coming down
[22:05] but let me read this thing because he
[22:08] says
[22:10] [Music]
[22:10] um
[22:13] how he puts it this he puts it this way
[22:16] that the seed was in the Earth
[22:22] but it was not yet cold
[22:27] but it was already there
[22:30] you see amen and it is in your book I
[22:34] don't have it but
[22:36] I will cook it
[22:39] if you read Genesis
[22:43] he speaks of this year
[22:46] and chapter one
[22:50] I'll have you
[22:54] okay just hold on
[22:57] chapter 1 chapter 1 now verse
[23:03] 11 verse 11.
[23:06] he it says and God said let the Earth
[23:08] bring forth vegetations they have
[23:11] wielding seed and fruit tree yielding
[23:15] fruit after its kind whose seed is in
[23:19] itself upon the Earth and it was song
[23:38] so now the prophet says because the
[23:42] seeds
[23:43] where are were already there was already
[23:48] there
[23:50] it was only waiting
[23:53] the time of its calling
[23:58] amen amen so and but the title I want to
[24:03] give yeah
[24:07] please you write the thing that I'm
[24:09] gonna read
[24:12] okay I
[24:14] will read two things here
[24:17] one says
[24:19] God dwells in the nature in the stature
[24:23] of a man
[24:30] and I have one part also to read to you
[24:35] all right I think it's somewhere here
[24:40] uh
[24:43] all right I've got it here with me yeah
[24:47] here you are God dwells in the stature
[24:51] of amen
[24:55] then this one says that is cod page 30.
[25:00] now if if we can find
[25:05] out what God is
[25:09] we can find what kind of man he has made
[25:37] because the Bible say yes
[25:41] and
[25:47] verse 8 verse 8 and being found in
[25:52] fashion as a man ah a question I
[25:59] know if
[26:05] verse 7 he says but I made himself of no
[26:10] reputation took upon him the form of a
[26:13] servant and was made in the likeness of
[26:16] men amen
[26:26] and being found in fashion as a man
[26:30] verse 8 says
[26:42] I don't know okay all right amen
[26:53] and we just trying to leave amen
[27:01] when he starts in the morning he says I
[27:04] lay the carpet he first starts with the
[27:06] porridge
[27:10] breakfast then when he gets to work okay
[27:17] he was found to be in fashioned with us
[27:24] any mood of a man
[27:27] amen amen then more
[27:31] okay
[27:33] I love come down
[27:36] he was a man
[27:43] um
[27:46] God is a man
[27:50] then why repeat see God
[27:55] so therefore surely it proves it
[27:59] when God came down to dwell Among Us
[28:04] she was a man
[28:10] God dwells in the stature of
[28:16] that means
[28:20] when he came down
[28:23] and when he reached us
[28:27] he was a man
[28:30] [Applause]
[28:32] that's why even in the end time
[28:34] we have the seventh angel messages
[28:40] when the seals reached us
[28:44] it was a man
[28:47] amen amen
[28:50] amen when God reached Philip Hamilton
[28:54] then he was a man
[29:00] so now that's why
[29:02] you will realize that
[29:05] many people could not
[29:07] accept or believe him
[29:13] because they had a certain mentality
[29:18] about God
[29:20] [Applause]
[29:21] so when he reached them
[29:24] he was a man okay Amen in this way
[29:31] um
[29:32] and they don't love him
[29:37] when he becomes
[29:42] [Music]
[29:44] they just want him to be a god
[29:49] a god they can worship without even
[29:52] knowing where he is
[29:56] but when he embodied himself
[30:00] then this is
[30:05] amen amen
[30:07] [Music]
[30:11] maybe I guess let me spoil it
[30:14] I was told that even yesterday they
[30:19] didn't want me to come there too
[30:21] the dedicational services
[30:30] they can't stop me
[30:34] okay
[30:37] so
[30:38] let me read you another thing here
[30:42] um
[30:43] yeah I'm I'm on a ghostly but but not a
[30:49] strike
[30:51] not striking amen
[30:54] the people the Jesus was masked to these
[31:00] Greeks
[31:06] so when they come to him he was masks
[31:14] and and they couldn't understand
[31:19] why that they couldn't see him
[31:23] because they came thinking that God
[31:27] would be this or that
[31:30] but only when they arrived
[31:33] there's two demands
[31:35] [Music]
[31:37] this is the unveiling of God
[31:40] page 17. page 17. they come to see God
[31:45] they've seen amen
[31:50] foreign what do they come for see God
[31:54] whatever so disappointed
[31:58] I'm coming see God
[32:12] we imagine
[32:19] and when you got there you find a man
[32:22] amen amen
[32:25] foreign
[32:55] foreign
[33:11] [Applause]
[33:24] they were around him
[33:28] after making that statement
[33:33] and they said listen to him now amen
[33:36] amen I'm the bread from heaven
[33:41] then
[33:43] let me read it for you
[33:47] we are not in a hurry amen
[33:51] is there anyone who's going to uh
[33:56] Victoria
[34:05] so much
[34:09] he just come to church
[34:11] and say uh brothers and sisters
[34:16] our national team is playing today yeah
[34:20] you need our support
[34:22] and our prayers
[34:27] you see amen
[34:36] well there is
[34:41] so he will just read for the sake of
[34:44] reading and say Jesus loved the world
[34:48] we also love the football lines
[34:53] then 15 minutes 15 minutes let us pray
[34:56] the people can get chance to see
[35:01] amen amen then when the Sun goes down
[35:04] the people are sick because
[35:12] after his prayers
[35:14] okay so God bless you now here we are
[35:19] I will read this part that is John
[35:23] chapter six and
[35:30] for I came down from heaven not to do my
[35:34] own will but the will of him that sent
[35:36] me
[35:37] and
[35:46] uh
[35:49] Kia movies
[35:51] verse 41. I'm going to verse 14. the
[35:55] Jews then remembered him because he said
[35:58] I am the bread that came down from
[36:02] heaven
[36:12] he was Healing The Sick
[36:15] they were following him but he
[36:19] declaration now when the Declaration
[36:22] came the Bible says
[36:38] I am from Heaven
[36:44] because he said I am the bread that came
[36:48] down from heaven
[37:01] how is it then that he said I came down
[37:04] from heaven
[37:07] amen amen and Jesus therefore answered
[37:11] and said unto them
[37:14] not among yourself the son who taught us
[37:18] no man can come to me
[37:22] amen amen uh he showed them the distance
[37:28] they've been there around him
[37:31] how she couldn't come to him
[37:37] it is just like if you are in this place
[37:41] physically
[37:44] physically amen amen and yet if you
[37:48] at the end of it all
[37:51] you have failed to come to God
[37:54] you were just here in the vicinity
[37:59] amen amen but you never
[38:01] um
[38:12] now inside of you
[38:15] there is uh it's a body okay
[38:21] the spirit
[38:26] amen amen now you are inside of you
[38:30] there is a way
[38:34] from your mind
[38:37] down to your soul
[38:40] that's how you can travel yeah
[38:46] and now to reach God
[38:49] you've got to travel as the prophet says
[38:55] it comes down the mind
[38:57] when the word of God comes to you
[39:01] and your mind catches
[39:04] but it has to go down to the soul yeah
[39:10] amen amen when it is in the mind it is
[39:14] theology theology
[39:17] you can't go further
[39:20] that's where theology is coming from the
[39:23] most theology that's where denomination
[39:25] is coming the denomination found the
[39:28] word of God stops in the minds
[39:32] then you'll start to think
[39:37] this one I don't understand this one I
[39:39] won't tell you I'll take this one that
[39:42] is in the mind but once it drops
[39:48] [Music]
[39:51] I can read it quickly once it drops in
[39:55] then it's something different
[39:59] okay amen if I don't have it yeah
[40:05] to you
[40:07] amen so now you see these things as we
[40:11] are carrying on reading
[40:12] the prophet speaks of this
[40:18] okay let me maybe it's around here I'll
[40:22] I'll catch it quickly I mean
[40:25] he speaks of these things
[40:27] how is coming down your mind
[40:32] amen
[40:37] okay I will read it
[40:40] let me find the the position
[40:44] or the the page which I don't remember
[40:48] in which page okay
[40:53] are we together
[40:56] all right amen it's a marked page I will
[40:59] find it I think
[41:01] your faith here in this in this book
[41:04] your faith
[41:06] um
[41:08] I won't surrender I'll find it
[41:12] yeah he says
[41:14] and
[41:17] I could preach the word
[41:20] you could accept it
[41:23] and say that's all right
[41:26] I believe that yeah
[41:29] well if that's all the further it ever
[41:33] goes then you'll never get very far with
[41:36] God
[41:38] foreign
[41:49] but if
[41:51] is the feather it can go hello
[41:56] he says you won't go far with God
[42:01] why because it's not just to say I
[42:05] believe it
[42:07] for the way to to be made manifested
[42:14] amen amen by just saying I believe
[42:17] you won't go far with God
[42:22] amen amen
[42:26] like what I said last night
[42:29] if you say I say to you you believe what
[42:33] you meant that there is communion
[42:40] but if you don't partake oh you don't go
[42:43] far with God
[42:45] why because that way it must be
[42:48] manifested
[42:52] we know that is the word of God
[42:54] manifestation
[43:00] is
[43:02] being fulfilled
[43:04] it's manifested
[43:07] amen amen so it's not just to say I
[43:10] believe
[43:11] but is to leave it
[43:17] come that way
[43:20] amen amen
[43:23] then you are with God
[43:25] because God said let there be
[43:29] and there was light
[43:33] so if he say something
[43:36] and you do it so you are you are
[43:39] together with God
[43:43] but if you just believe it yes
[43:50] amen amen so here we are
[43:55] uh it says Siri
[43:58] then you'll never get very far with God
[44:02] it's intellectual Faith
[44:06] that's the reason people doesn't get
[44:08] healed
[44:12] is because they only have an
[44:14] intellectual view of it
[44:20] amen amen
[44:23] God Jesus heals but if it should be made
[44:28] it's energy either it should be

[46:47] drop down so I have to help so I just
[46:50] left them like
[46:53] by the time we finish

[48:49] like a usual I said to her or I just
[48:52] hold my hand I said you are all right
[48:58] it is because
[49:01] I saw the sister that day she believed
[49:04] in me
[49:08] now you listen she didn't believe me as
[49:12] God
[49:21] amen
[49:24] you causing God why God decide to
[49:27] brother Brennan made people to believe
[49:35] amen amen

[49:50] to locate yeah
[49:55] to believe God where he is
[50:01] to believe him from where he is
[50:08] amen amen
[50:10] it will be a better thing

[52:09] and overrun Moses
[52:12] thinking that they will come and stand
[52:15] before God
[52:16] yeah we have come ourselves now because
[52:19] Moses is always coming alone here
[52:26] we are here ourselves they couldn't
[52:29] reach him
[52:31] the only way they could
[52:35] reaches in Moses

[53:22] then you'll be able to see what kind of
[53:25] man yes
[53:31] okay amen oh let me finish my statement
[53:37] um
[53:38] the reason people can't get healed
[53:44] is because they only have an
[53:47] intellectual
[53:53] what their mind conceives
[53:58] but the mind will reason change
[54:03] it cannot be uh
[54:08] um
[54:09] okay let me go where it you'll
[54:13] understand
[54:15] all right like somebody is prayed
[54:18] foreign
[54:19] Arabella and theory
[54:22] and you say Jesus Christ has healed you
[54:27] know he listens from my mind
[54:31] that hey that pain is still there
[54:34] amen amen so now he will keep that pain
[54:40] in his mind
[54:42] and as long as he's keeping the pain in
[54:45] his mind not happening the pain will
[54:48] remain in his toes
[54:52] [Applause]
[54:54] until he let go and believe what the
[54:57] word has said
[54:59] in July
[55:01] because if there is the word says you
[55:04] are healed
[55:05] it is like Let There be lights
[55:11] I mean amen and so surely now he says
[55:15] now listen this where I was coming
[55:20] and when once that faith comes down into
[55:24] the compartment
[55:34] would you just see
[55:37] amen amen
[55:39] so once it is in the compartment
[55:45] there is the reason people
[55:48] doesn't get where they should be no okay
[55:55] this morning foreign
[56:03] [Applause]
[56:06] [Music]
[56:28] like when someone has a dog on a leash
[56:37] the dog would would like to attack
[56:42] maybe another dog but because it is
[56:55] holding tight on the other side
[56:59] so but it will run but he will pull it
[57:05] Satan does the same thing
[57:08] he can put you only
[57:13] you come and say Jesus Jesus
[57:19] so you can't just reach the place
[57:23] now you remain with a wish
[57:30] but you don't reach it if you're happy
[57:34] amen amen
[57:40] sing the song closer together now it's
[57:44] not just to be close
[57:46] house nor is to reach the place
[57:50] the Bible says
[57:52] he God says he who finds me who finds
[57:57] life
[58:01] and it says seek the Lord and find him
[58:08] instead the people are finding churches
[58:11] [Music]
[58:13] seek the Lord
[58:19] okay amen
[58:22] uh yeah the last thing it says
[58:28] but when once that faith comes down into
[58:31] that compartment is
[58:34] [Music]
[58:36] that means the faith must come in there
[58:41] it's compartment which is
[58:47] not in their mind they seem more popular
[58:54] there will never be a question
[58:58] because their their faith can blossom
[59:03] if you can hold the seed
[59:06] close to the ground be a house it won't
[59:10] geminate
[59:12] you must bury it
[59:15] in the ground amen now if you you you
