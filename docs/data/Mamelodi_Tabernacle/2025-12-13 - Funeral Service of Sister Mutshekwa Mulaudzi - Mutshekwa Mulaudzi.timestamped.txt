[27:50] We are really blessed.
[27:55] We cannot do a lot of work being alone.
[28:03] We can say we really appreciate your
[28:05] support.
[28:07] The family of
[28:17] We
[28:18] &gt;&gt; we we say thank you.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; You are doing the right thing because
[28:31] the Bible says to go to the uh family
[28:34] which is grief is better than to go to
[28:37] the family which is rejoicing.
[28:48] They are doing a right thing by saying
[28:51] comfort the person which you know him
[28:54] better.
[28:57] We we are saying to the family
[29:09] what you have done uh to help one
[29:12] another. That is what you supposed to do
[29:15] as a family while you are still living.
[29:21] We can we are saying to all of you
[29:27] &gt;&gt; this uh old lady which we are gathered
[29:31] to be here because of her.
[29:38] We are the eyewitness that she have been
[29:40] sick for long time.
[29:51] As a family, they didn't fold up their
[29:54] arms. They have done whatever they can
[29:57] in order to save the life of her mother.
[30:08] Our
[30:12] mother she have passed on while she was
[30:14] there in the hospital at Messina's
[30:16] hospital. But we have done everything we
[30:19] can so that she can leave.
[30:29] You as a witness just believe that it is
[30:33] through our mother she have passed on.
[30:42] We don't want to hear a myth when you
[30:45] said we have seen uh our mother uh doing
[30:49] some woodwork or something uh on the
[30:53] bushes.
[30:59] You are a eyewitness that we have buried
[31:02] our mother.
[31:04] We can say to the children
[31:09] &gt;&gt; a departure of our mother.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; The family is still around.
[31:20] Make sure that we give them the news.
[31:25] Let's not just take rational decisions
[31:28] alone.
[31:33] Tomorrow those decisions will hurt us if
[31:36] we don't contact the family.
[31:39] The tiba family,
[31:43] &gt;&gt; the family still around you.
[31:46] The the the the
[31:49] grandchildren they are still here.
[31:53] Come and visit
[31:56] as you used to do when you used to visit
[31:59] your
[32:01] All these families
[32:04] go to the
[32:07] &gt;&gt; and give a support.
[32:20] We know that the departure of our mother
[32:23] doesn't separate us as a family. It must
[32:25] unite us.
[32:31] When we are saying the elders from the
[32:33] church,
[32:40] we don't want to disturb them. When we
[32:42] leave here, we are going to the
[32:44] graveyard.
[33:02] This is a royal family. Uh normally the
[33:06] way we bury our people sometimes it
[33:08] might surprise you the way we do our
[33:11] traditional or our norms.
[33:19] If you feel free, just go there. But if
[33:23] you are not free, don't just go there.
[33:40] We have as family accepted that it is
[33:43] through our mother. She have left. She
[33:46] have left or she have passed on.
[33:53] I have a song that I want to sing. Can
[33:56] you support me?
[33:58] I normally sing this song.
[34:06] Oh [singing]

[35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:56] I'm here representing Thomas which is my
[35:59] older brother.
[36:04] Today he is not here.
[36:07] He he had some commitment.
[36:14] He called me and said I must take the
[36:17] his part.
[36:21] I accepted that uh command from my
[36:24] brother.
[36:32] We are really deeply saddened by the
[36:36] departure of our elder mother.
[36:49] To me, she she was not like a granny.
[36:52] She was like my mother because I know a
[36:55] lot about the mother.
[36:57] Uh
[37:04] from my youth up until today, I've
[37:08] learned from the old mother.
[37:17] I really thank God because he left me
[37:20] while I know how to do things for my
[37:23] own.
[37:29] I saw my grandmother for quite a long
[37:33] long time while she was sick.
[37:40] Even on her last days I was here, I'm
[37:43] I'm the one who took her to the hospital
[37:47] last of last week Friday.
[37:51] I remember last of last week on Friday
[37:53] while I was talking to her through a
[37:55] phone,
[37:59] first thing she asked that did you come
[38:01] back?
[38:07] uh she asked me a question and then I
[38:10] said to her I didn't come back and then
[38:12] she said when are you going to come back
[38:18] and then I answered that I will wait for
[38:21] the closure at work so that I can come
[38:23] back home
[38:29] she asked that can you fetch for me a a
[38:32] pig and a goat
[38:38] Um, I really want to eat the meat of
[38:42] that uh while I'm seated with you at
[38:44] hospital.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Things turn around after I hear about
[38:56] the call about my uncle uh the departure
[39:00] of our mother.
[39:05] We accepted that it is the God's love.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; As for my for me, I really feel that it
[39:22] was a blessing from God to really heal
[39:26] is a truly healing of our mother.
[39:50] As a grandchildren, we will be united.
[39:53] We will always put our differences
[39:55] aside. As a people, we need to fetch
[39:58] forward uh together as a grandchildren.
[40:03] I really thank you. Amen.

[43:21] Morning
[43:38] everybody.
[43:42] While I'm here,
[43:47] &gt;&gt; I'm deeply saddened about the elder
[43:51] Especially
[43:59] myself, Chipia and Chilo Ni
[44:04] and Tambuzani
[44:08] because our mother,
[44:13] she is the one that raise us up66
[44:20] &gt;&gt; when we came to this land in 1976.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; She took all of us and bring us all of
[44:29] us here.
[44:34] We we we came here and then we grew up
[44:38] with her at
[44:45] she taught us a lot of things like
[44:47] plowing
[44:55] She also taught us about going to fetch
[44:58] the wood.
[45:04] She taught us a lot of things also
[45:07] including the love of people.
[45:13] I remember uh
[45:19] &gt;&gt; okay I remembered while I was uh being
[45:23] married
[45:26] she was very upset
[45:30] she asked me a question where are you
[45:32] going my my daughter
[45:36] &gt;&gt; and then I told I told her that I'm
[45:38] going to to be married
[45:42] She said, "You cannot go there."
[45:47] &gt;&gt; I said, "Mother, can you allow me to go
[45:50] for to be married?"
[45:53] &gt;&gt; She said, "Listen to me.
[45:57] If somebody uh have hurt you,
[46:03] don't ever come back.
[46:07] Just tell me what hurt you so that I can
[46:11] give you some advice.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; You don't go there alone.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; I went there with Damboo.
[46:23] When we arrived there, there was they
[46:25] were really comforting us.
[46:32] All these children when they returned
[46:34] back home, I really bitterly cried.
[46:41] I remember the words of the of our
[46:44] mother that she didn't want us to go
[46:46] there.
[46:55] One thing which my mother have told me
[46:57] is that if a man comes back at night,
[47:05] You need to make sure that there's a
[47:07] warm water and then there's a food for
[47:09] your husband.
[47:13] After that, you go and sleep peacefully.
[47:20] If your husband looking for for the
[47:24] porridge, you must tell her that tell
[47:26] him that I have already cooked. It's
[47:29] just that he's now called
[47:35] &gt;&gt; that your husband cannot come to my
[47:38] house and tell me that you didn't cook
[47:39] for him.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Uh my children's mother,
[47:48] &gt;&gt; our mother have departed.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Let's agree.
[47:56] I can spend a lot of time.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; We didn't know by the name her by the
[48:04] name of Mua.

[48:15] the name English.
[48:21] She really likes those names English or
[48:24] ma my mother. She really feel like

[1:26:19] We have but a very short time
[1:26:25] but I want to thank you all
[1:26:29] for being present
[1:26:33] in the service of our mother.
[1:26:41] May the Lord richly bless you all.
[1:26:46] May the Lord bless the royal family.
[1:26:52] May the Lord bless the family and the
[1:26:54] neighbors
[1:26:58] and all the elders and the people from

[1:27:07] even those that are coming from a far

[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; I'm not a pastor.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; He is not a pastor.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; I'm just an elder in the church.
[1:27:23] A pastor means a shepherd.
[1:27:30] So just bear with me as I will be
[1:27:32] reading the scriptures.
[1:27:37] For those that are able to stand
[1:27:42] in respect of the weight, I will ask you
[1:27:44] to stand
[1:27:47] as we read the book of First
[1:27:48] Thessalonians
[1:27:52] starting from verse 13 to verse 18.
[1:28:02] I will ask
[1:28:05] just to say a word of prayer
[1:28:12] as we close our eyes.
[1:28:15] [clears throat]
[1:28:15] Amen. Amen. We can pray.
[1:28:31] to pay a last respect to our mother.
[1:28:46] [clears throat]
[1:28:47] for
[1:28:55] [clears throat]
[1:29:03] Foreign
[1:29:13] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.
[1:29:38] Amen. Amen. Amen. Verse 13 says,
[1:29:44] "But I will not have you to be ignorant,
[1:29:48] brethren,
[1:29:50] concerning them which are asleep that
[1:29:52] you sorrow not, even as others who have
[1:29:55] no hope.
[1:29:58] For if we believe that Jesus died and
[1:30:00] rose again, even so them also which
[1:30:03] sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
[1:30:08] For this we say unto you by the word of
[1:30:10] the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:30:13] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:30:16] not prevent them which are asleep.
[1:30:18] For the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:30:21] heaven with a shout with the voice of an
[1:30:24] archangel and with the trump of God. And
[1:30:27] the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:30:30] Then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:30:32] be caught up together with them in the
[1:30:34] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. and
[1:30:38] so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:30:40] Wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:30:43] words.
[1:30:50] Yes.
[1:31:14] Fore!
[1:31:33] Foreign! Foreign!
[1:31:38] Fore!
[1:31:47] [cough]
[1:31:59] Foreign! Foreign!
[1:32:18] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; So I'm here just to comfort the family.
[1:32:27] [clears throat] You know, every time I
[1:32:28] read the word of God,
[1:32:32] I find a love story.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; You know, I always wondered why they
[1:32:40] called the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:32:42] bridegroom.
[1:32:52] The reason I call it the love story
[1:32:58] A man
[1:33:01] when he proposes a woman,
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; he gives promises.
[1:33:09] Say, I promise you that I will build you
[1:33:12] the best house.
[1:33:17] In another wedding, I remember
[1:33:21] the man promised the the wife a seatless
[1:33:29] So there's a lot of promises when a man
[1:33:31] proposes a woman.
[1:33:38] I'll make you the best woman on earth.
[1:33:40] [clears throat]
[1:33:45] I'll give you my name.
[1:33:49] You know all the promises.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; I had another one even promising the
[1:33:57] woman,
[1:34:00] I'll buy you a train.
[1:34:04] You see, a proposal goes with a lot of
[1:34:07] things inside.
[1:34:13] The Lord Jesus Christ when he came to
[1:34:15] the earth
[1:34:18] He brought a message
[1:34:21] to propose us.
[1:34:24] You see the Bible says,
[1:34:27] "The Lord himself shall descend from
[1:34:29] heaven with a shout."
[1:34:34] So he descended all the way from heaven.
[1:34:39] And the Bible says with a shout.
[1:34:43] See that shout was a proposal.
[1:34:48] it was a message going forth.
[1:34:52] So when he was giving out the message,
[1:34:56] there were so many promises.
[1:35:00] And one of the promises,
[1:35:02] he says, if you believe my saying,
[1:35:08] verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; you shall not see death.
[1:35:15] what the proposal
[1:35:17] everybody was scared of death.
[1:35:21] But when he descended coming down,
[1:35:25] uh my brother, if you can just read, uh
[1:35:29] uh
[1:35:31] I just want to show you this love story.
[1:35:36] You know, uh John chapter 8 and verse
[1:35:39] 51.
[1:35:42] And and here when he was coming down
[1:35:46] giving a message out
[1:35:48] one of the promises
[1:35:51] that he brought
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; in the proposal you shall not see death.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Can you read it my brother?
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; John 8:51 verily verily I say unto you
[1:36:03] if a man keep my saying he shall not see
[1:36:06] death.
[1:36:07] You see where we read
[1:36:11] it says
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; I will not have you to be ignorant.
[1:36:20] You know in in the language that we use
[1:36:22] here on the earth
[1:36:25] when somebody depart
[1:36:29] the language that people understand
[1:36:35] it says the person is dead.
[1:36:41] But when the Lord Jesus Christ came,
[1:36:44] he says that is an error.
[1:36:49] When you read Matthew chap 22 verse 292,
[1:36:57] he said that is an error.
[1:37:01] That's why he says I don't want you to
[1:37:02] be ignorant.
[1:37:08] When Lazarus was sick,
[1:37:12] He said, "Our friend Lazarus
[1:37:17] sleepeth."
[1:37:19] That's right.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; You know, the disciples didn't even
[1:37:21] understand.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Oh Lord,
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; he if he sleepeth,
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; he does well,
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; he will wake up."
[1:37:37] So he had to talk to them in a language
[1:37:40] that they understand.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, "Lazarus is
[1:37:48] dead."
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; The language they understand.
[1:37:54] So our mother
[1:37:57] believed the proposal
[1:38:01] that came when the Lord descended coming
[1:38:03] to the earth.
[1:38:07] when he gave our mother a proposal
[1:38:12] to say verily verily I say unto you
[1:38:16] if you believe my saying
[1:38:19] you shall not see death our mother said
[1:38:23] amen
[1:38:24] accepting that proposal
[1:38:27] you see death
[1:38:30] if we have to define it
[1:38:34] the Bible Death
[1:38:37] is total separation from God.
[1:38:41] So our mother is not separated from God.
[1:38:46] He said there are people that die
[1:38:49] that are separated from God.
[1:38:52] But the one that believe he's saying
[1:38:57] will not see death. meaning he is not
[1:39:01] totally separated.
[1:39:04] You see a person is a triune being.
[1:39:09] You are a body
[1:39:12] which is this terrestrial being.
[1:39:18] When Job looked at it,
[1:39:21] he said, "Hey, this one is full of
[1:39:22] troubles."
[1:39:25] And it's of few days
[1:39:28] when the prophet Job looked at this body
[1:39:33] said, "Ah, this one is full of
[1:39:36] troubles."
[1:39:38] So you can't even brag about this body.
[1:39:41] I heard one of the scientist
[1:39:45] saying this body is not even worth more
[1:39:47] than 10 cent.
[1:39:59] Then inside of this body
[1:40:02] is a spirit.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; You see when the Lord made a person
[1:40:10] he said
[1:40:12] when you read Genesis chapter
[1:40:16] 2 verse 7
[1:40:20] it says and God formed man out of the
[1:40:22] dust of the earth.
[1:40:27] So this man is of the dust of the earth.
[1:40:31] That's why we
[1:40:34] take him back to the grave.
[1:40:39] But then he says he breath into his
[1:40:41] nostrils,
[1:40:44] the breath of life
[1:40:48] and a man became a living soul.
[1:40:51] So you are a triune being.
[1:40:54] You are a body,
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; you are the spirit
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; and you are a soul.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Now when you depart,
[1:41:08] the Bible says,
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; the spirit
[1:41:13] goes back to God.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; The body
[1:41:20] goes to the grave.
[1:41:23] But the soul
[1:41:25] when it departs,
[1:41:28] it depends what you believed.
[1:41:31] If you believed in the word of God,
[1:41:34] it goes under the altar.
[1:41:37] It is in the presence of the almighty
[1:41:40] God.
[1:41:42] But if you didn't believe his saying,
[1:41:47] your soul goes to the prison house.
[1:41:52] And the language that we use
[1:41:55] is it goes to hell
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; and it will be tormented there in
[1:42:00] flames.
[1:42:03] But you see the Lord Jesus Christ said
[1:42:08] we
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; because if you believe he's saying
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; you shall not see death.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; And he said I am
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; my brother I want you to read that
[1:42:22] scripture.
[1:42:24] Matthew 22 verse start with 29
[1:42:31] and go to verse 32.
[1:42:35] Matthews 22 29.
[1:42:38] Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do
[1:42:41] a not knowing the scriptures nor the
[1:42:45] power of God.
[1:42:47] Verse 32,
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; 30
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; 34.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Yes. 30 31 and 32. But as
[1:42:54] touching the resurrection of the dead,
[1:42:57] have ye not read that which was spoken
[1:43:00] unto you by God, saying, I am the God of
[1:43:03] Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God
[1:43:06] of Jacob. God is not the God of the
[1:43:09] dead, but of the living.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; You see, let's go back to John chapter
[1:43:14] 8.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Because he says, God is not God of the
[1:43:19] dead.
[1:43:24] death is total separation from God.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; So when they look at Abraham,
[1:43:33] Isaac,
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; and Jacob, they are not dead.
[1:43:38] Hallelujah.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; That's why he says God is not God of the
[1:43:41] dead
[1:43:46] because they are in the presence of the
[1:43:49] almighty God.
[1:43:52] But those that are not in the presence
[1:43:54] of the almighty God,
[1:43:57] they are dead.
[1:43:59] So we must never
[1:44:04] go and see what they were saying. H
[1:44:09] starting from verse 51.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; I will read it my brother and you will
[1:44:14] interpret it. Chapter 8.
[1:44:19] Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man
[1:44:21] keep my saying, he shall never see
[1:44:23] death.
[1:44:28] They challenged him.
[1:44:31] They challenged the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:44:37] They said, "Now we know you have a
[1:44:39] devil."
[1:44:43] You see, when he was telling proposing
[1:44:48] and saying you shall not see death.
[1:44:53] They said this man has a devil.
[1:44:57] See they were not accepting the
[1:44:58] proposal.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; They said Abraham is dead.
[1:45:05] But before that
[1:45:07] he said unto the same people,
[1:45:10] God is not the God of the dead.
[1:45:14] He is the God of the living.
[1:45:17] You see, he said, "I am
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; the God." Read that verse 32 again, my
[1:45:24] brother.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Verse 32,
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; "I am the God of Abraham and the God of
[1:45:27] Isaac."
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Just stop there. Is a present tense.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say I was.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; I am
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; because they passed away.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; It says I am.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Read it, my brother. I am the God of
[1:45:45] Abraham
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; and the God of Isaac
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; and the God of Jacob.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; God is not God of the dead but of the
[1:45:54] living.
[1:45:57] They challenge him. Now they say now we
[1:46:00] know you have a devil.
[1:46:03] Abraham is dead.
[1:46:06] The prophets are dead.
[1:46:09] How can you say
[1:46:11] if a man keep my saying
[1:46:16] he shall never taste of death?
[1:46:20] They looked at him. He was a very young
[1:46:23] man.
[1:46:25] No 33 years old.
[1:46:32] When they looked at him, he said, "Art
[1:46:35] thou greater than our father Abraham?
[1:46:41] And they reminded him
[1:46:43] which is dead.
[1:46:48] And the prophets
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; are dead.
[1:46:54] What makest thou?
[1:47:01] You know, I'm sure they were even saying
[1:47:03] undermining him.
[1:47:13] You know somewhere they even say you are
[1:47:15] not even 50 years old
[1:47:19] and you say you have seen our father
[1:47:21] Abraham
[1:47:27] and he was giving them a proposal.
[1:47:32] Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; So even when let's go to the book of
[1:47:37] Genesis.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; You see when when
[1:47:43] the wife of Jacob passed away
[1:47:48] I love uh chapter 35 verse 185
[1:47:53] 18
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; and it came to pass
[1:47:56] as her soul was in departing.
[1:48:02] You see
[1:48:04] now because they understand people won't
[1:48:06] understand the soul is in departing
[1:48:11] then in they say for she died
[1:48:16] just to make people understand
[1:48:21] but the Bible doesn't say h if you
[1:48:24] believe the gospel of Jesus Christ you
[1:48:25] die
[1:48:32] depart
[1:48:34] you know you go to it's like a promotion
[1:48:37] you go to the presence of the almighty
[1:48:39] God
[1:48:42] you see here on the earth we are absent
[1:48:47] from the almighty god
[1:48:50] so he comes and propose you
[1:48:54] so that when you depart
[1:48:56] you come into his presence
[1:48:59] amen let's go back to the book of
[1:49:01] Thessalonians.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; You see that shout
[1:49:07] was the message going forth
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; in Matthew 25.
[1:49:18] They talk about the wise and the foolish
[1:49:20] visions.
[1:49:24] You see the message when it goes forth,
[1:49:28] it goes to the wise.
[1:49:31] And it goes to the foolish.
[1:49:34] You see when when you sleep
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; because it says the wise and the
[1:49:39] foolish,
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; they slept.
[1:49:44] Now when the bridegroom came,
[1:49:49] they woke up. That was the resurrection.
[1:49:53] Now when when the wise
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; woke up
[1:49:59] because they had the spirit that raised
[1:50:02] Jesus Christ from the dead,
[1:50:06] they went with the bridegroom.
[1:50:10] But these others, they didn't go with
[1:50:13] the bridegroom.
[1:50:22] You see, you need to have the spirit
[1:50:26] that raised Jesus Christ from the dead
[1:50:29] in you
[1:50:33] before you depart
[1:50:36] because it is the same spirit that will
[1:50:38] raise you up.
[1:50:42] Now, let's go back to the book of
[1:50:45] Thessalonians.
[1:50:48] You see when he was proposing now
[1:50:51] the first promise that he gave he said
[1:50:54] you shall never see death
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; that was the first promise. Now the
[1:50:59] second promise was the voice.
[1:51:04] Now that voice is the resurrection.
[1:51:09] You see the Bible says blessed are those
[1:51:11] that come in the first resurrection.
[1:51:17] says, "After you have departed,
[1:51:20] you are not dead,
[1:51:22] and I will raise you up."
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to John chapter 5.
[1:51:33] Don't worry, I won't be long.
[1:51:36] I'm just telling you about the proposal
[1:51:38] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:51:41] The first thing he said, you shall not
[1:51:43] see death.
[1:51:46] John chapter 5.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Let's read uh verse 25. Let's start with
[1:51:54] verse 24, my brother.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Verily, verily I say unto you, he that
[1:51:58] heareth my word and believe on him that
[1:52:01] sent me hath everlasting life. You see,
[1:52:20] Can you finish it, my brother?
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; And shall not come into condemnation,
[1:52:24] but is passed from death unto life.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; What a promise.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; You see the proposal,
[1:52:35] this proposal thing didn't start uh
[1:52:38] here.
[1:52:41] for a man to propose a woman.
[1:52:44] It's not a thing that started here. The
[1:52:46] Lord himself when he came here, when he
[1:52:50] met us, he started with a proposal.
[1:52:55] If you hear my word,
[1:52:58] you have everlasting life.
[1:53:00] What do you say?
[1:53:02] If you hear my word, you have
[1:53:05] everlasting life. If you believe
[1:53:09] You shall not come into condemnation,
[1:53:14] but you have passed from death
[1:53:16] unto life.
[1:53:18] Even the scientists cannot promise you
[1:53:20] this.
[1:53:22] You see the scientist
[1:53:26] this
[1:53:29] when when they talk about shooting the R
[1:53:31] going up there.
[1:53:38] They talkative
[1:53:41] but you ask them about death
[1:53:43] the countenance fall
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; because they are troubled about death.
[1:53:50] You go to a medical doctor,
[1:53:53] you say, "You see, I for you to get
[1:53:55] healing, I must give you this injection.
[1:54:00] You ask ask them about death."
[1:54:03] The countenance fall.
[1:54:06] You see, they can't promise you
[1:54:08] anything.
[1:54:10] One man promised us life.
[1:54:14] Verse 25, my brother.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; 25.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour
[1:54:19] is coming, and now is, when the dead
[1:54:22] shall hear the voice of the Son of God,
[1:54:25] and they that hear shall live.
[1:54:39] You see that was the second promise.
[1:54:42] You see, he says in his proposal,
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; you'll come in the first resurrection,
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; if you hear my voice,
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; then he says, if you don't believe me,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; come
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; let's go. I will show you where to go.
[1:54:58] Where's Lazarus?
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Where have you buried him?
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Come. Let me show you
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; my second promise.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Lazarus. Lazarus, come forth.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; And Lazarus came forth.
[1:55:11] demonstrating the promise
[1:55:13] to say even if you depart
[1:55:18] I will bring you up
[1:55:20] you will be blessed because you will
[1:55:22] come in the second in the first
[1:55:24] resurrection
[1:55:27] then he didn't stop there with the
[1:55:28] promise
[1:55:30] he went again
[1:55:32] and said and the trumpet of God shall
[1:55:35] sound
[1:55:38] this is the most beautiful heart. You
[1:55:40] see, if you propose a woman and the
[1:55:44] woman accept
[1:55:46] your proposal,
[1:55:49] you go home, you tell your parents,
[1:55:52] I'm ready to get married.
[1:55:56] You promise them a white wedding.
[1:56:00] That's what the Lord did. He said if you
[1:56:02] accept my proposal
[1:56:05] you know after the resurrection
[1:56:08] you'll meet we will meet again I'll take
[1:56:11] you to the palace
[1:56:15] for the marriage supper
[1:56:21] he he gave us a lot of promises
[1:56:25] because we have a short time
[1:56:28] I'm just bringing these three promises
[1:56:31] If you hear his word,
[1:56:34] you have everlasting life. You will not
[1:56:37] come into condemnation.
[1:56:40] If you depart, he will resurrect you
[1:56:44] and and he has already prepared a
[1:56:46] marriage supper.
[1:56:50] You see, not here
[1:56:53] in the palace.
[1:56:55] You see, I've had people reading John 14
[1:56:58] verse 1 and 2.
[1:57:02] When he was leaving, he said, "For those
[1:57:05] that have heard my word,
[1:57:08] don't worry that I'm leaving.
[1:57:11] I'm going to prepare a place for you.
[1:57:14] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:57:17] myself and take you into the palace
[1:57:21] where you have merit supper.
[1:57:26] and and and he he even went further
[1:57:29] and says, "I'm going to bring the Enoch
[1:57:34] to look after.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring the Jews,
[1:57:39] the 144,0004,000
[1:57:42] to take care of you."
[1:57:46] Hallelujah. you know, and he said after
[1:57:49] the marriage supper,
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; we are going for a honeymoon.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; We're going to celebrate for 1,000 years
[1:57:59] in the millennia
[1:58:02] before I can take you to the new
[1:58:04] Jerusalem.
[1:58:08] So, you see, this is a man that has
[1:58:10] promises,
[1:58:12] you shall not see death. What your
[1:58:15] proposal
[1:58:16] You shall not see condemnation.
[1:58:19] I'm going to take you to the marriage
[1:58:20] supper.
[1:58:22] When you die, I'm going to resurrect
[1:58:24] you.
[1:58:25] Don't be ignorant of him.
[1:58:28] Don't
[1:58:30] he has all the promises.
[1:58:33] And he said after the marriage supper,
[1:58:37] I'm taking you for a honeymoon.
[1:58:41] How long does your husband take you for
[1:58:42] a honeymoon?
[1:58:48] I still owe my wife a honeymoon
[1:58:51] [laughter]
[1:58:51] because I could not even afford it.
[1:58:55] And even if I can afford it, it won't
[1:58:58] even be more than seven days.
[1:59:01] You see, but this one honeymoon,000
[1:59:06] years
[1:59:08] after [screaming] the honeymoon,
[1:59:10] he says, "Now you are going to judge the
[1:59:13] dead.
[1:59:15] You see the people that come in the
[1:59:17] second resurrection,
[1:59:19] the Bible calls them the dead. It says
[1:59:21] you are going to judge them.
[1:59:24] Then after that, I'm taking you into
[1:59:27] into our house,
[1:59:30] the new city,
[1:59:32] Jerusalem.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; The new Jerusalem.

[1:59:46] Uh we were given up until 8:00.
[1:59:50] So with this few words,
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you,
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; accept the proposal
[1:59:58] from the Lord Jesus Christ. Like our
[2:00:01] mother here, she is blessed. She will
[2:00:05] come in the first resurrection.
[2:00:07] She's going to go into the palace
[2:00:10] for a merry supper. She's going to go
[2:00:12] into the millennium.
[2:00:14] She's going to judge some of the people.
[2:00:18] She will go into the new city.
[2:00:21] So if you want to meet our mother, if
[2:00:24] you really and truly loved her,
[2:00:27] accept the proposal. [laughter]
[2:00:30] And if you hear his word,

[2:00:36] that you must be baptized in the name of
[2:00:38] the Lord Jesus Christ.

[2:00:44] proposal of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:00:50] then we baptize you in the name of the
[2:00:52] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:00:54] You don't need money.

[2:01:03] Jesus Christ. God bless you.
