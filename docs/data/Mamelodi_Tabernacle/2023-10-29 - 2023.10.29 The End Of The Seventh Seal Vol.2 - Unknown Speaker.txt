Description:
Title: The End of The Seventh Seal Vol 2.
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima on 2023-October 29 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

Genesis 18: 17- 23  I John 1: 1-2  Ephesians 1:4

The Bride has one heart, and that is why we remain one in him. When we look in this age we see that the Lord has come down and we draw near.

God is not weak and if you believe in Him you will never be weak. The people who have eternal life are concentrating on  things that are eternal. Your life speak much louder than your mouth.

True worshipers shall worship in spirit and truth. You should not worship in Mamelodi but in Christ. You can't worship God with an old soul, it must be changed. We are serving God with a new soul. The Bride of christ has only one language. 

All the seals ended up in the seventh. If you don't have the seventh you don't have the seals. The Bride of  christ is not new in the message. What saves you today is not something that is coming but what was has been there back then. The seventh seal was spoken off from back in genesis. 

The pastor codes the following spoken words:
57-0818 Time Tested Memorials of God  Par 104 - 105
61-1015M Question and Answers Par 159 - 160
64-0802 The Future Home Par 205
63-0324E The Seventh Seal Par 304 & 78

amen amen they are waiting for but the time has arrived and we shall meet them shall we just stand up for the reading of the word and we have I'm going to be so short and there's a reason why you oh where is my friend okay fine where are we we are looking at the the end of the seventh [Music] seal and if he [Music] come and look for we have this white stone and you know we sometimes ago spoke about this subject the flying interpretation interpretation interpretation right amen actually even now we are engaged under that the flying interpretation that's right amen we will follow that and I will look at the white stone as well but let's take this today God bless you uh did we read the scripture No all right I'm looking for the scripture here but it doesn't appear let alone let us read this part I don't see any Scripture here do you see any Scripture okay let's go to the Book of Genesis Chapter 18 chapter 18 since any Scripture since we not we cannot find the scripture yet yeah chapter 18 chapter 18 and let us thank God Cape Town we went to to by his grace and we arrived back amen amen children of God were giving us some great testimonies when they visited us uh a day before our departure from that place now they were busy giving us testimonies if your soul is right with God then you've got a testimony if you are looking for a job and your soul is right with God you will find that [Applause] joob amen amen because God cannot lie so that's why he says find God and all things are possible now before our uh departure because I don't see any Scripture here I will read this scripture chapter 18 and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation amen and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him amen for listen for I know him H I believe how glad was Abraham listening to to God Amen saying I know Abraham that he will command his children amen amen as we are the Seed of Abraham after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord yes amen and I remember the first time reading that part that says behold I will send to Elijah the prophet and he shall turn their hearts the heart of the children back to their fathers there that's why this morning you are the heart not Hearts he said the heart so the bride has one heart that's why we remain one in him because we are a heart for I know him what a wonderful thing to be known of God that he will Command right [Music] amen it was a time like our time that's why he continued to say and for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him that is Abraham and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which H he has spoken of him God has spoken something of you and because God is the keeper of his own way he's not like men if God says something he's going to keep that way then he said and the Lord said because the Cry of Sodom and Gora is great and because their sin is very Grievous I will go down when you see God coming himself yes I will I will go down and see he stood up to come down like in this age of [Music] ours the Lord stood up to come down because he says where to see whether they have done all together according to the cry the sin of men the sinful life of men whom he created to worship Him caused him to come down to see whether they have done Al together according to the Cry of it which come unto me uh what is what what is God receiving this morning from us [Music] here and if not I will know then they maintain their phases from things and went towards Sodom but Abraham stood before before the Lord and He draw near amen amen you know if we look at this age and uh we see the Lord God that he has come down we should draw near but it say and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do you may be seated God bless you so that's why this morning God could not hide from us that's why we will see the flying amen amen you know I I was looking for this book this morning H because in the pyramid there was a white stone and we'll still come to that after touching this this morning but there is time tested memorials time tested memorials before we we carry on or we take off you you know what is in that in this book and you know I'm I'm talking I'm going to talk to you about the thing you are familiar with there was this man do you say his architect yes amen amen and uh an American from all over the world Bridge Builders when the people were afraid of a job to build a a bridge across the sea and uh then this man came because all those who came before him they could just go down up to the S and they all went back to say we can't build a bridge because down there it [Music] sent and then then came another man who knew that and set of his reputation he said say I'm not afraid to take the job and I realize that I have a worldwide reputation I don't know how you regard yourself you know as church goers we used to say just also he testifies he doesn't say that he talks of what we are amen now if you talk to somebody and say also we says me too is just weak weak people now we come to a place where we can manifest because we can't talk about the power of God and turn again around and speak about the weakness of God is not weak and if you believe him you'll never be weak amen I remember when I was told about two M where one neighbor was walking around it was in the morning and then she was busy looking around now she sees the [Music] neighbor like this CH the Sun amen amen he says how are you says hi we are fine it's just the devil is oppressing us as a Christian now this one as a Christian said I am also all right but God the blood of Jesus Christ has freed me has taken me out of the grip of the devil that's whyu I sing hallelujah amen amen you can start singing amen h i don't spend the time that I I have is for the word of God all right even last night yeah all this time that is the time I don't have time for cell phone I'm just wait for a call when calling somebody that's all the time is for the word of because cell phone pass away the people people with eternal life are concentrating on things that are [Music] Eternal your life speaks louder than your mouth amen amen so now here now you've heard what God Said shall I hide from Abraham the thing that do I do so what a wonderful God who shall never hide from you the things that he do that's why I know we know to worship him and I know the place of worship all right amen now now this man I I won't take time on this it says oh blessed be the Lord that that's the reason that there is a heaven to go to that's the reason we can have a reputation as a Christian we know that material is in this building that's right so let's take this man and finish amen now that man he said I will take this job I wonder you two this morning if the word is preached whether you will take say I will take this job as a Christian because some have failed now God today is looking for the people who will never fail like the other people because the one who has failed still profess to be the bread of Christ but what about this hatred so if you profess to be a Christian but you hate your brother the Bible says you are like a cane in the message if you hate your brother and you say I'm in the message you are a can in the message but the message is not in you all right Amen in the message instead of you being in the message let the [Music] message let the message be in you amen today you can swap amen amen you take the message and the message to be in you then nature so that the nature amen can come up that's why I I can read you this part here I was looking at it and for the Bible says the true worshiper shall worship God in it didn't say in m in spirit don't Worship in M Worship in spirit and Truth uh I was reading here about the soul soul as you say my soul say yes the prophet says here you are soul body and spirit but it takes uh the three to make you if then there is Father Son and Holy Ghost but it speaks of one person now if you are Spirit soul and body it makes you one but the key here is the soul you know the prophet say soul body and spirit he says actually the soul that's where you live amen now I'll show you this ministry of the end time that God came down he has seen the conditional in this world and he has come down all right as he said shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do okay I read here uh I just want to finish this part when we talk about changing uh it says here it speaks of the nature the soul is the nature of your [Music] spirit you know you can't beat your nature if the soul is not in you you'll continue you can talk about God Christianity but yet you still need to be changed now I read it is your soul that been changed amen the old soul died and the new Soul which is the new nature was born into [Music] you you can't worship god with the your old soul it should be your soul then it says your brain is is not your intelligence page 676 c o 6 usually say this child has a brain even when he takes as long as he can show Flames they say this child has brain wise child a wise child is a child who fears God education don't make you wise the wisdom of God what is the wisdom of yes it's says it is the first wisdom your brain is not your intelligence it's the spirit that's in you is your intelligence your brain is a bunch of matter cells and so forth amen amen but God do not look at your brain but he looks inside of your heart where there is soul now I'm trying to take to say this this is the last thing yeah it is your soul that's being changed you know if the soul is not Chang you remain with your old nature amen amen the old soul died I have now realized that when old soul there is an old soul died and the new Soul which is the new nature Was Born Into You you now know about the new soul you can worship god with yes now let's read this now and close and we'll come back for the white stone and these other things there a wonderful book here the future [Music] home home of the Blessed I'll start from here I'm think last time I believe we looked at it last time where it says I repeat somebody might say to me brother brother what are you going to do now yeah that is the question also for you you've run out of your complete [Music] s where are you going to now okay Church age you speak about the seven Church age you've run out of that and where where are you going from there okay then it say you have run out of your servants where are you going now you are a dispens list where am I going be yeah I just yeah now then it says here we become wait a bit now you are a dispensationalist and he says I am because it says where are you going now like I I can ask you that question where are you going now we are you know without this message we become so miserable if it were not message because of this message in my soul in your soul I would be frustrated even now after this service where do I go Mar you know we are so generous is on a journey when we come I'm just going to body but my soul is going somewhere [Applause] else got this body in this body I will L up in m but that is not my destination NOK I'm there waiting I'm waiting for that day when I shall leave this body and get into the new body but let me say to you we are saving God with the new Soul that's why you see the this message we don't have messages that's why I'm not talking about the message Church no because I'm told of Message Church Nows a message they are dimensions of the message now if you say message churches if I can put those churches together will there be an agreement amongst them one will say the seven SE is not revealed another one will say another one will say and they are called message churches now we don't meet message churches we need the bride of Christ because the bride of Christ has got only one language amen amen okay now here he says now I could because I'm coming to this for a few moments of where are you going now now the end of the seventh seene then that's why we have arrived at the Pyramid of angels not that old pyramid now let's read that and leave it there all right are we together now if you are going to put something beond the seventh day how are you going to get it where where are you going [Music] now if your faith goes beyond the seven so there's no turning back once you go beyond seven amen all right after the seventh day is the which is the first day amen that means the church has come to the end we are talking about church ages but we are only in one Church age the seventh others we are talking about the people that are in another dimension now those that are here together with those who went before when talking about the seven Church ages seven you should know that we are here in the church where is the seven Church ages we are talking about part of it is beyond time that is part of it yeah we are one Church age the seventh we don't have the first church age but we are talking about the seven Church ages but part of it is in the sixth Dimension now we that are living here are waiting for the day of the Rapture to meet the other part of the seven churches which was taken away is in the six Dimension all right then I read this here now it says where are you going now at the end of the seventh Angels message P 562 that is of the s all the mysteries of God would be known let's try and read it all the mysteries of God all including the [Music] seventh you know all the Mysteries are kept by the seven uh if I I I read this part here page 562 5 I must look at the was clock there amen 56 are 56 right 562 amen it's here amen um you know you you notice now is paragraph 3 4 you notice now for the End of Time message this seal after all he has revealed all the six but he don't say nothing about the seven and the end time seal the end [Music] time because the seven the church ages ends up in the seventh Church age all the seals they end up in the seventh now if you don't have the seven you don't have seals because all the seals end up in the seven all the church ages up in one CH do when he opened I I said not when he preached no amen I'll tell you why the seventh seal which let me read it listen to this now notice for the end time message this seal is referring to the seven he has revealed all six but he don't say nothing about the Serv the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total [Music] secret it is a secret to [Music] whom according to the Bible it says uh at the end of the seventh Angel's [Music] message who is the end time message the seventh all the mysteries of God would be known at the end of the seventh Angels message now we at the time the opening of The Seven SE that is the end time because the seventh let's read here the end of the seventh seal I have something here which says uh let me read to you something here mm uh page 534 534 uh it speaks of five did I say 534 yes it tells me that from back from Genesis there this seventh seal is spoken of now if uh sometimes they sayy you are still KN in the message the bride of Christ is not new in the message you get what I mean amen because this seal this seven this seven seal spoken of from the beginning in this seventh now if the Bible says you were there before the foundation of the then you should know the seven because the seven is the end that's why H it is spoken of from amen amen and the Seven seal spoken of from the beginning now that which was from the beginning which we have head that which was now if the seventh seal was there that which was from beginning yeah was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes amen which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the weight of life amen amen the things that we hear today is the things we have heard that's the difference between just a believer and somebody as he says that which we have head that's [Music] p and which we have sin amen amen right amen amen continue what about what which we have heard and have seen what are you going to do with that which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested all right all right all right all right meaning we are preaching to you showing you that eternal life because what saves you today it's not a thing that is coming is that and the Bible says we have seen it have you seen eternal life all right that which was that's why if you are predis you are not struggling with cigarette or a young man running with girls he was not there those who were there amen you know the seventh SE is for those who were there because all the way back fromis or Genesis Genesis is that so amen okay whatever you say Amen the seveny is spoken of from now there are those who are trying to catch up with it but there are those who came with it if you have eternal [Music] life you have received it back there because Revelation is something that r [Music] that which we [Music] have what is revealed to me is that which I have heard and I have seen and have handled amen the seventh seal cannot be preached by somebody who has noted the seven SE because it speaks for itself that's why it now from the the very beginning in Genesis the sth SE now if you have begun today you are late because the seven from now if if it is from there those who are there are not looking for the seven se you see because that seven SE is from there now go back to the bookis Genesis all right let's go there amen I don't think you'll be satisfied to receive a message from the person that was not there I think as the prophet has said here if you are predestinated you need a predestinated pastor otherwise it won that's why uh you know we are here I can't worship any I I can't go to any other place I was not born is that right if even now you hear some people saying you know I want to go to the United States United States just to change places all right but I don't think I will have a better life if I go to United States states because I'm not going to United States United States I am going to heaven that's the difference that is the place as we are so generous United States United States I we have our brothers there even now I I have prayed did I pray for past brother yes great gabri brother gabri his body is in America but his soul is here with us and brother Larry me Larry yes am we are together and we are going to be together right amen these are the people I can go go along with because we have come from the same place I remember brother gabrielson gab when he was as about his uh existence coming here he spoke of wanting to touch somebody's hand imagine you take some thousands kilometers just to greet some meaning that before we are taken up we have already started to greet one another you know if you can say to me go to great brother [Music] mes I can take a flight just to drop there and greet him and said I'm glad that we are together and jump back into the place that would be a great thing to me just to greet all right what is that we are starting to meet we have started to meet in order to meet am okay amen now I'm look I'm closing now listen to this from Genesis the 7th now your soul was there even before there was Genesis amen I don't know if you'll believe with me if you are predestinated you were there before there was [Music] Genesis you didn't start in Genesis no you were in him as the Bible says for we were amen hearing Ephesians amen oh the brother news don't wor amen Ephesians EP Ephesians chapter 1 verse four according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world right amen uh ACC could as he has chosen Us in America in M no in him where are you from you you are from him there was no place where he could go and choose you but the only place amen amen he looked into himself we we were in him that great soul that great being a mighty God tells you that he has chosen [Applause] you in him amen you know this can cause you to run up and down chosen by the almighty God what did you see in me because he wanted you to be like [Applause] him you know this word can keep you forever chosen you in him read it again according as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world Listen [Music] before the foundation you are already chosen [Music] when when he h created the Earth you were watching from him that's why the things of the world cannot take you away from him because you existed before there were things of the [Applause] world all right Chen where Lord in him before the foundation of the world meaning you have seen the world before you were born born you have seen the word now your Supernatural nature knows about the things of the world and that's why you'll shine them because you were before [Applause] them and then you hear them people saying the sin is controlling him if you were chosen in him that was before there was any sin now who came who was the first to come was it sin or you so that's why you can be controlled by sin because you were chosen before there were sin you have power over s because you were before s you have tasted eternity so how can you live in sin because you have tasted eternity when God said let there be you were watching from him you were before that you can be ruled or overcome but something that came after you exist a wish was not there because if she was there she cannot become a witch because he says that we have heard Hall from wichcraft came after which where is your soul but the soul of the Sons and Daughters of God came from [Applause] him before there was any [Music] sin that's why it says he that is born of God cannot sin why because he has the nature of his father the Bible says he that is is born of God you know I read in the book where the Prophet says God gave C God gave be to himself when he be he came as Jesus he after he gave birth then he comes as Jesus and say before the world was before Abraham was I am he says now because the Seed of Abraham that's why he says shall I hide from Abraham knowing that he will amen amen so all these beings were in him and today they are they are you can say this man is the message believer what is the message everything anything can be a message even denying God is a message even denying the is a message no you can be in any kind of a message but your nature cannot deny you as I said the last time he who hates his brother the Bible doesn't say if he hates this brother because of this and that no hatred is hat from the devil from Satan if you hate your sister your brother even now as I am speaking you've got the reason why but the Bible doesn't speak of reasons it speaks of hatred he doesn't want any reason he says love those amen amen now God will not force you he says I am saying love them that hate you no he is speaking to those who were in him but those that were in him he can say love because they came from him he gave them a nature Peter says he gave us Divine divine nature is not something is not something that you go around reading I tell you I know of many money lovers I know them money lovers they doesn't they don't want to part with whether he has a lot of money lovers and she or he can rob you when you say where do you worship Fellowship my brother and you say but why don't you pay that brother now the problem came he is not fellowshipping in Christ he is fellowshipping don't Fellowship Fellowship in Christ in closing there were two sisters I met them in waking at the DRL they said to me brother do you know brother and I knew already why they ask me that question because we knew the brother this week is a Christian next week is something so they met him when now he was something else amen actually he is not a Christian but he can act Christianity like the people those they only love those that love them exchange gifts exchanging gifts and things but only fa to those that love them you know a Christian I have learned even something the Bible says do not lie in different way lying comes in in different ways a a person comes to you say my dad I have nothing don't you have five friends he say ah nothing you're lying you rather say I have it but I'm just going to use it for something else but if you say I don't have this how you mean not even telling lies tell him the truth I just but if I have it I give him I won't lose anything blessed is the hand that give blessed amen I was with the brother in his here at moral somewh and here comes a man coming and said at home I left my wife and kids I can't find job so and so I left the wife and children and then having nothing not even bread now we looked at him together with the brother we realize that it's not not a he's actually saying the truth so now because we were in the shop will pick up some things pick up a few things now he says how do how do know I I don't want to know what I know when we looked at we saw that this man is telling the truth amen he just said I was saying he was saying if you could just buy me something that I can go give the children so and now if we could have said we don't have money now we were supposed to confess to say you remember we said lies to that woman when are you going to start confessing such going around telling people just as because you love money when they go he actually make sure that he doesn't carry money with he wants to be true when he meets people he goes out so that when he says I don't have he has is at home but he says now here with me I don't [Music] have he's keeping it at home to avoid the very situation the Love of Money the root of all land it is the one that causes money rituals even babies are no because this money lovers they make uh an agreement with them that a child like this if you can bring them now a person goes and kills for challeng for money the people who do not know God that's it amen they've already closed right I stop right here then let us come back I don't know why God wanted me to Cross this way I've got a message here the end of the seventh [Music] SE I haven't touched it and it kept us the almost the whole night go because we could not sleep without completing here it is I haven't touched it the brother can see it amen amen now you don't know the ways of God but we come with the end of the seven SE we are going to read it not to saying to those that are waiting for it to be revealed the end of it but we are only going to look at the end of it it even [Music] ends all things that's when will pick up this flying interpretation our the interpretation interpretation that the bride has received you'll see what it means flying when we talk of the flying I took it from my Prophet here when he received that fly it's not from it's not from Amica it's flying interpretation fly interpretation wait until we come we know we went through it but we've got it here and we'll even visit we'll see who is this new t one among the Angels but there's one the notable then there's again here the angel with the seventh seal with amen it is here but God
