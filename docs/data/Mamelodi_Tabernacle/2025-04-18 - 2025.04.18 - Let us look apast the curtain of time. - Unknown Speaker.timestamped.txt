[45:13] Lord,
[45:15] and even gave us a pastor that teaches
[45:18] us, Lord
[45:21] Almighty. And Lord Almighty, you even
[45:24] gave love within ourself
[45:28] to recognize each other as brothers and
[45:31] sisters, Lord.

[46:01] restoration lord and to be redeemed by
[46:04] thee.
[46:06] And you also gave us Lord Almighty a
[46:09] name, a mighty name,
[46:13] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[46:18] And you assured us that with that name
[46:20] not demon can stand before us.
[46:26] And father as we are closing our eyes

[1:40:55] Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[1:41:04] [Applause]
[1:41:15] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:41:32] I have a testimony.
[1:41:37] I'm working as a teacher
[1:41:39] at I think four years
[1:41:52] back. The pastor was in Switzerland. I
[1:41:54] came with my with my certificates to ask
[1:41:56] for a promotion at work.
[1:42:02] But when they were shortlisting, I was
[1:42:04] not
[1:42:10] [Music]
[1:42:14] shortlisted. But I continued applying
[1:42:16] because in my heart I knew that the
[1:42:18] pastors prayed for the situation.
[1:42:24] Last year October the post were
[1:42:26] advertised.
[1:42:29] I then
[1:42:35] apply. I heard that they were called
[1:42:38] early January to be
[1:42:41] interviewed. But I was not
[1:42:44] called. It wasn't easy for me.
[1:42:51] under a
[1:42:54] leadership. If you have ever worked
[1:42:56] under a leadership that hates
[1:43:01] you, I've seen that beginning of January
[1:43:05] this year.
[1:43:09] It's like a person who would not want to
[1:43:12] know anything or to say anything about
[1:43:14] you. As a
[1:43:16] result, early
[1:43:19] retirement, as a result, one of them end
[1:43:22] up taking an early
[1:43:31] retirement. H the situation was so bad
[1:43:33] to an extent that he said that if I knew
[1:43:37] how to be with you, I would do that.
[1:43:40] One other
[1:43:42] time all over the
[1:43:45] body and I
[1:43:49] called there was this time where I had
[1:43:51] rash all over my body after he had said
[1:43:54] those words and then I called the pastor
[1:43:55] asking for a prayer.
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:44:04] treat at the hospital. They could not
[1:44:06] know what to do anymore because they
[1:44:08] tried everything but nothing was
[1:44:10] working.
[1:44:13] That week on Wednesday, it happened that
[1:44:15] in the very same week on
[1:44:17] Wednesday, 10 to 5,
[1:44:20] it was around 10 to 5 in the evening, I
[1:44:23] got a call
[1:44:26] [Music]
[1:44:29] for interview. I got a call from
[1:44:31] Department of Education saying that I
[1:44:33] should arrive at for an
[1:44:40] interview. We pray we pray together with
[1:44:43] my family over
[1:44:48] this. But he came to
[1:44:54] me and I then thought to myself, we
[1:44:57] pray, the pastor has prayed about this.
[1:44:58] Now is the time that I must be
[1:45:00] shortlisted.
[1:45:04] I called sister
[1:45:07] Dodto. He she then connected me to Qua
[1:45:10] to Aquilla because Quila was with the
[1:45:12] pastor.
[1:45:20] for interview. I then called Quila to
[1:45:22] connect me to the pastor. I then asked
[1:45:24] the pastor that tomorrow I am called for
[1:45:26] an
[1:45:32] interview. The pastor responded and said
[1:45:34] to me, "What time are you going to be
[1:45:36] there? 9:00 a.m." I said, they said to
[1:45:39] me, "I must be there at 9:00 in the
[1:45:41] morning."
[1:45:47] The pastor said to me, "Call me tomorrow
[1:45:48] at 9:00. I will go in there with you."
[1:45:52] [Applause]
[1:45:54] [Music]
[1:46:01] And then I got to 9:00 and then I
[1:46:04] called. He then told me that the pastor
[1:46:06] just went
[1:46:09] out or he rested. He's
[1:46:12] [Music]
[1:46:15] resting in my heart. I then thought,
[1:46:17] okay, the pastor said he will go in with
[1:46:21] me. We were about 24. I went and there
[1:46:24] was a very long queue and we were about
[1:46:37] 24. Okay. And when I got there, there
[1:46:39] was a
[1:46:42] queue. I then called again.
[1:46:48] He said to me, "The pastor is not yet
[1:46:51] awake. He's still
[1:46:55] resting.
[1:46:59] meeting.
[1:47:02] Luckily, Luckily, there was a the board
[1:47:04] that was supposed to interview, they had
[1:47:06] a meeting and then they delayed to call
[1:47:08] us
[1:47:13] and then we were seated according to our
[1:47:15] our sequence and I was number eight. I
[1:47:19] was on number
[1:47:24] eight. I then check again with Qua and
[1:47:27] Qua said the same thing that the pastor
[1:47:28] is still
[1:47:33] resting and then when I was getting
[1:47:35] closer and then I switch off the phone
[1:47:37] thinking that he's going to disturb
[1:47:40] me and then when there was three people
[1:47:43] in front of me I then switch on the
[1:47:47] phone then I found
[1:47:52] call
[1:48:00] WhatsApp and then before then he said to
[1:48:04] me send a voice note and your your photo
[1:48:06] I will send them to the pastor and then
[1:48:08] in my heart I thought that's what not
[1:48:10] the pastor
[1:48:11] said then I did not
[1:48:16] send I found I called and he answered
[1:48:22] He said, "The pastor is awake now
[1:48:24] waiting for
[1:48:29] you." And then I moved to the side and
[1:48:32] the queue was moving. There was three
[1:48:33] people in front of
[1:48:38] me. Then I said to the pastor, "Pastor,
[1:48:41] there's three people. I'm just speaking
[1:48:42] Lord because I was closed now."
[1:48:49] And then the me send me your photo in
[1:48:51] send your photo so I could pray.
[1:48:55] And then the pastor prayed.
[1:48:59] He then said to me, "Go in. I will go
[1:49:01] with
[1:49:01] [Music]
[1:49:01] [Applause]
[1:49:06] you." I went in, I came back feeling
[1:49:09] great.
[1:49:13] I went in for an
[1:49:16] interview. I was so confident because I
[1:49:19] was working with the
[1:49:25] pastor. All the questions that they've
[1:49:28] asked me, it was not me
[1:49:31] answering, but it was the pastor
[1:49:33] responding to those
[1:49:37] questions. I left 10 to 5 on the very
[1:49:42] same day 10 to
[1:49:46] 5 tomorrow and then the call came
[1:49:49] through and then say we need you
[1:49:50] tomorrow at
[1:49:52] [Applause]
[1:49:54] 8:00 when I get to then we went

[1:50:13] everyone was saying that after you left
[1:50:15] yesterday, they thought you are going to
[1:50:17] get this position the way you were so
[1:50:19] confident.
[1:50:22] Yes. Now I am

[2:57:14] you. If it it is so with you, you'll say
[2:57:17] amen.
[2:57:20] to claim for
[2:57:26] me that what he redeemed
[2:57:30] as
[2:57:33] from two.
[2:57:37] That means
[2:57:39] he has redeemed you
[2:57:44] from two. Exactly.
[2:57:48] Amen. Okay. Now to claim his redemptive
[2:57:55] to claim his rights.
[2:57:58] Uhhuh. Amen. Then
[2:58:01] now the lamp with the book in his hand.
[2:58:09] Uh ready
[2:58:11] to Okay. Now with the
[2:58:17] book this thing
[2:58:19] is folded like this. Now with the book
[2:58:26] uh in his
[2:58:30] hands, we are
[2:58:32] ready to ask grace
[2:58:36] mercy to open the
[2:58:39] seven
[2:58:42] book. Let us
[2:58:46] look and let us
[2:58:48] look past the curtain
[2:58:56] of as I
[2:58:58] say. I was listening to a young
[2:59:01] man last
[2:59:05] night when
[2:59:08] he he was sort of disturbed.
[2:59:14] We were sort of disturbed
[2:59:18] like
[2:59:21] this like you are a son of God.
[2:59:27] And if should somebody
[2:59:31] say
[2:59:33] brother harvest
[2:59:36] is a child of God.
[2:59:40] Somebody is
[2:59:44] disturbed just
[2:59:47] like the brother in
[2:59:49] Australia disturbed some
[2:59:54] people. Amen. He
[3:00:01] disturbed
[3:00:02] brother dist.
[3:00:08] We are coming to our
[3:00:12] title. The Jews were
[3:00:16] disturbed and said, "You are a
[3:00:23] man." Those were Jews. They were
[3:00:28] stepped. He's a man, but he thinks he's
[3:00:33] God. Now, let me tell you something.
[3:00:37] If you say to a man, you are a man, but
[3:00:42] you make yourself
[3:00:43] God, that means he has seen God in
[3:00:50] you. Amen. But because he doesn't
[3:00:53] believe God, he he he is
[3:00:58] disturbed. If God appears in
[3:01:02] you or if somebody gives a testimony,
[3:01:06] about the God who is in
[3:01:09] you. Then
[3:01:12] they said to the Lord
[3:01:14] Jesus, "You are a man,
[3:01:18] but you make yourself God."
[3:01:22] Amen. Amen.
[3:01:25] Apostles and
[3:01:28] them they were
[3:01:30] killed. Why? Because they
[3:01:34] said they were disturbed by the fact
[3:01:38] that they
[3:01:40] said they make this man God and yet he's
[3:01:45] a
[3:01:46] man. Are they not saying the same
[3:01:50] [Music]
[3:01:52] thing? Amen. Otherwise I'm leading you
[3:01:55] to something.
[3:01:59] They said you are a
[3:02:00] man
[3:02:02] but you just make yourself a god.
[3:02:07] They even
[3:02:09] killed those who would say he is
[3:02:12] Messiah. He is God. They were killed for
[3:02:19] that. He is a
[3:02:22] man. All right. Amen. Brother, you are a
[3:02:25] man, but you are a child of God.
[3:02:29] Amen. The Lord
[3:02:31] Jesus came as a
[3:02:36] man. What disturbed them was that the
[3:02:41] form was of a
[3:02:44] man. Now the people who cannot see
[3:02:49] spiritual
[3:02:50] things, they cannot see spiritual
[3:02:53] people.
[3:02:56] Amen.
[3:02:57] Did you hear this? Amen.
[3:03:00] They if they can't see what is in a man,
[3:03:06] they
[3:03:07] start to say, "Who you think you are?
[3:03:11] You are a
[3:03:13] man. as I was listening to this young
[3:03:17] man.
[3:03:25] Okay, for last
[3:03:28] minutes for we we are coming
[3:03:33] to to arrive at the end of the whole
[3:03:36] thing.
[3:03:39] Now he says, "Let us
[3:03:41] look at the kitten of
[3:03:45] time." Amen. Amen.
[3:03:49] If you look at a
[3:03:51] man with the eyes of a man,
[3:03:56] you will say, "You are a man, but you
[3:04:02] make yourself go." That's what how they
[3:04:06] said to Jesus.
[3:04:10] Amen. God is not worshiped
[3:04:14] by such people.
[3:04:17] I'll tell you as we will read
[3:04:22] the Lord
[3:04:24] Jesus
[3:04:26] actually his real real
[3:04:31] form which the people cannot
[3:04:34] see is inside.
[3:04:39] Did you hear the letter the book we
[3:04:45] read? This is not from from the
[3:04:50] bookshop. Mhm. Amen. God when he looks
[3:04:53] at
[3:04:54] you. He looks at the
[3:04:58] form which is the your
[3:05:03] form
[3:05:05] form. Tell me about your real form.
[3:05:09] Christ.
[3:05:12] Christ. Amen. Yes.
[3:05:20] Amen.
[3:05:22] Inside you are like
[3:05:25] him. Otherwise, you won't believe
[3:05:29] him. If your
[3:05:31] inside is not him, you won't believe
[3:05:35] him.
[3:05:38] That's why the people do not believe us.
[3:05:43] Because they are not like us
[3:05:49] inside. Amen.
[3:05:55] They know that God is
[3:05:59] holy. Now that's why if you hear them
[3:06:03] saying
[3:06:05] to the Lord Jesus Christ you are a
[3:06:09] man but because the
[3:06:12] form is of a man now they are looking at
[3:06:16] the form but they don't look
[3:06:22] at you can't see God by
[3:06:30] That's
[3:06:31] why I'm closing it.
[3:06:36] Let us look
[3:06:38] up the curtain
[3:06:43] of because if you look at Jesus, you are
[3:06:46] looking at a man.
[3:06:50] But if you are looking
[3:06:52] at the Christ, Amen.
[3:06:57] What does the word Christ mean?
[3:06:59] Anointed.
[3:07:01] Anointed one.
[3:07:03] Now there's two things about
[3:07:05] men. You can look at a man the form of a
[3:07:09] man. You are a
[3:07:11] man but you make yourself
[3:07:15] God. But if you you can look
[3:07:19] inside because
[3:07:22] uh God make things like
[3:07:26] this. You as a
[3:07:28] Christian, you don't look like a a mere
[3:07:31] man.
[3:07:35] You don't see
[3:07:39] like God has sent a
[3:07:42] prophet
[3:07:44] and one
[3:07:47] says they are worshiping a
[3:07:50] man. It was the same thing in the time
[3:07:55] of because the others were inside us.
[3:08:01] [Music]
[3:08:03] You know, I had a book here. I don't
[3:08:04] know whether it's still around
[3:08:07] here. If no, if it is not here anyhow,
[3:08:12] I'm just lying a
[3:08:14] carpet. We still coming to
[3:08:18] talk. Brother, get this out for me,
[3:08:25] please. Okay, let me see.
[3:08:32] Uh
[3:08:35] yes. Uh
[3:08:38] saints,
[3:08:42] I I I I'm closing
[3:08:51] uh his ve.
[3:08:55] This is the unveiling of God.
[3:08:59] When he is veiled,
[3:09:02] the people say to him, "You are a
[3:09:05] man." But you are trying to make
[3:09:08] yourself
[3:09:10] God because he is
[3:09:14] veiled to them. But to us he is. We can
[3:09:20] see
[3:09:21] inside he unveiled to us.
[3:09:27] Amen. God is like that. He's veiled to
[3:09:32] somebody and unveiled to
[3:09:37] somebody. But if he is unveiled to
[3:09:41] you, he is God. He is Christ. He is
[3:09:46] Messiah. He is unveiled to you. But to
[3:09:50] the other one, they said, "You are a
[3:09:54] man.
[3:09:58] They ended up crucifying
[3:10:01] him thinking that they were dealing with
[3:10:04] a
[3:10:06] man. On the third
[3:10:09] day, the man they thought they
[3:10:13] destroyed was working with the
[3:10:19] disciple. Amen. Amen.
[3:10:22] The very same one
[3:10:23] they now how do you know that somebody's
[3:10:27] not a Christian?
[3:10:31] That's when he will say to you,
[3:10:34] you are a
[3:10:37] man. You can realize this man can't see
[3:10:41] anything. Okay. Amen. But that one says
[3:10:46] thou art the Christ.
[3:10:49] And this one says, "You are a
[3:10:53] man. Are you are you here?"
[3:10:59] To this one,
[3:11:01] he is Christ. To this one, he's just a
[3:11:08] man. Do you see the difference?
[3:11:11] We are still coming to read things
[3:11:14] here. Now I look here.
[3:11:20] He he could change himself
[3:11:24] and to
[3:11:26] his to his he would appear
[3:11:34] but they could they could see
[3:11:38] inside of him.
[3:11:43] Let me close in this
[3:11:46] way. As I'm telling you
[3:11:50] that I saw a man, a young man, he looks
[3:11:56] so
[3:11:57] angry because I have said
[3:12:02] something and to him he thought I'm
[3:12:06] trying to make myself
[3:12:10] go. Mhm.
[3:12:13] All right. Amen.
[3:12:16] If you are a child of God,
[3:12:22] let talk about a lamp.
[3:12:27] Lamp is a child
[3:12:29] of a
[3:12:32] sheep. That's right.
[3:12:36] So now and the nature
[3:12:40] if you don't like
[3:12:43] uh
[3:12:49] sheep. Amen.
[3:12:52] [Applause]
[3:12:54] The people who don't love God, they
[3:12:57] don't love
[3:12:59] you. Amen. Why? Because your
[3:13:04] nature is
[3:13:08] divine. Amen. Now it's two different
[3:13:14] nature. This one with another
[3:13:19] nature will hate
[3:13:22] you because his nature is not the same
[3:13:26] as you.
[3:13:30] [Music]
[3:13:32] Amen.
[3:13:35] That's
[3:13:37] why if your nature is that of
[3:13:40] God, the person who hates you is the one
[3:13:43] with the nature of
[3:13:48] Satan. They hated the Lord Jesus. Their
[3:13:51] nature of the devil.
[3:13:56] Amen.
[3:13:59] So they would say things about him.
[3:14:05] He's a man but but he just make himself
[3:14:09] God because they are outside.
[3:14:14] Now those that that are
[3:14:17] in they know Jesus
[3:14:20] Christ from the inside.
[3:14:27] All right. Amen.
[3:14:30] A lion
[3:14:33] cannot worship
[3:14:37] with a lamb.
[3:14:44] This one is a lion.
[3:14:47] You get what I mean? Amen. Now brothers,
[3:14:52] let me say this.
[3:14:55] He said, "But we are coming to something
[3:14:59] wonderful,
[3:15:00] something that will make you so happy
[3:15:04] as a
[3:15:06] child of
[3:15:09] God. If you hate your brother just
[3:15:13] because he's a
[3:15:14] Christian, you are
[3:15:18] robbed." Amen.
[3:15:26] uh from way back
[3:15:32] there were those who wanted to
[3:15:35] uh throw their brother into a a dish.
[3:15:42] Was it a well or what? What was it in a
[3:15:48] ditch?
[3:15:49] Why they hated you? Yeah, they hated
[3:15:55] him now because the nature in
[3:16:01] their was of the God they
[3:16:09] hated. Amen.
[3:16:12] In
[3:16:13] closing, I'm just
[3:16:19] [Music]
[3:16:22] because they hated him. He
[3:16:27] say he says even you, they will hate
[3:16:30] you.
[3:16:36] Now somebody can bow down and say
[3:16:41] God,
[3:16:42] I pray for for this brother. I don't
[3:16:46] love you, don't like him.
[3:16:50] You think God is like you?
[3:16:55] No. But the people can say, "Lord God, I
[3:17:00] I don't like this brother.
[3:17:03] Yeah, I pray that you deal with him."
[3:17:09] thinking that God is like
[3:17:13] him.
[3:17:15] Okay. Some other prayers say you must
[3:17:19] look at them.
[3:17:22] They are
[3:17:25] dangerous. Yeah. They are not godly.
[3:17:29] [Music]
[3:17:34] Lord God,
[3:17:37] when I just look at him
[3:17:39] I'm just
[3:17:40] bored. You think God will be listening
[3:17:42] at such a
[3:17:54] prayer. God has got no jokes.
[3:17:58] [Music]
[3:18:01] Now I'm I I'm preparing this. Hello.
[3:18:07] Uh now you
[3:18:10] must I always read for the people who
[3:18:14] hates God's prophet.
[3:18:18] [Music]
[3:18:21] When brother Brennham speaks about a
[3:18:23] prophet,
[3:18:27] he
[3:18:28] says a prophet.
[3:18:32] So, so it
[3:18:34] was God. A prophet was
[3:18:39] God in a
[3:18:43] man. Now watch your
[3:18:46] nature. A Christian
[3:18:49] is God formed in a man.
[3:18:57] Now you hate a Christian
[3:19:00] because you you hate God.
[3:19:05] [Music]
[3:19:10] Then a brother says to you,
[3:19:15] you know, me and you, we were
[3:19:18] together before the foundation of the
[3:19:22] world and it it hurts
[3:19:26] somebody because that somebody is
[3:19:31] God. Now if you are you appear before
[3:19:36] him and your nature
[3:19:39] inside is of
[3:19:42] God, every person who hates God hates
[3:19:48] you because the
[3:19:51] nature of
[3:19:57] God. Did you
[3:19:59] see? So a prophet
[3:20:03] It was God
[3:20:06] formed in a man called a prophet.
[3:20:12] Amen. Right. Amen. Now your
[3:20:16] nature if it is not of God surely you'll
[3:20:20] hate
[3:20:22] this
[3:20:24] because the nature
[3:20:29] you have the nature of God. Amen.
[3:20:33] So you won't hate your brother.
[3:20:37] You can manage to
[3:20:41] hate if the nature in
[3:20:44] you is not of God.
[3:20:52] Okay. Amen.
[3:20:54] I was talking with a
[3:20:56] brother
[3:20:59] about somebody
[3:21:03] You
[3:21:04] know, you know, some people they can
[3:21:06] just say I I don't I don't
[3:21:12] mean something that doesn't even exist.
[3:21:15] But he can
[3:21:19] say, you are a
[3:21:22] witch. And if you can say to a person
[3:21:24] that you're a witch,
[3:21:28] even though he's a witch,
[3:21:31] [Music]
[3:21:36] He just said I'm a witch.
[3:21:42] But if you can call them a
[3:21:45] sight, but are you not really a
[3:21:50] witch? It's people who made me to be a
[3:21:52] witch.
[3:21:54] I don't like this thing,
[3:21:57] but people made me to be
[3:22:04] Then you end up by saying, "Yeah, you
[3:22:06] are a witch."
[3:22:09] I'm telling you, it's the people who
[3:22:10] made me to be.
[3:22:15] The other day we were listening about
[3:22:20] witches. They said one comes to the
[3:22:23] pool.
[3:22:26] Today I'm not talking about that. I'm
[3:22:28] just
[3:22:30] passing. You see our pool where we
[3:22:33] baptize the others are really taking
[3:22:39] [Music]
[3:22:41] chances. They counted another one who
[3:22:43] has a shop
[3:22:47] and they also counted another
[3:22:53] one. those who wants
[3:22:56] to do
[3:22:57] whatever but like a child of God those
[3:23:01] things they don't bother me
[3:23:06] and I can't even go and try and question
[3:23:08] that
[3:23:12] person those that are in God
[3:23:16] they are not afraid of Satan
[3:23:19] Amen
[3:23:26] Where's that child?
[3:23:40] Yeah.
[3:23:44] Well, closing.
[3:23:49] The
[3:23:53] brother we talked. Who told you to go to
[3:23:56] the river there?
[3:24:07] Dad was praying for the
[3:24:14] sister, the pastor of this
[3:24:19] girl. What? What did he do to the
[3:24:23] church?
[3:24:25] The pastor of this girl
[3:24:29] He took some
[3:24:36] spirits. Now where are the
[3:24:40] spirits? The spirits return back to that
[3:24:44] [Applause]
[3:24:51] pastor. Children of God as I'm closing.
[3:24:56] Always hear people complaining or
[3:24:59] crying. He's the one who bewitching me.
[3:25:01] This one. Are you a Christian?
[3:25:05] Yes, I'm a Christian.
[3:25:10] He's bewitching
[3:25:12] you. I can't even
[3:25:17] sleep. And then
[3:25:23] Witchcraft is
[3:25:26] there. Even now,
[3:25:31] we can tell you even in the
[3:25:36] church,
[3:25:38] even goes to the pool and some
[3:25:47] things. Have you heard us here in church
[3:25:50] saying we're going to take the witches
[3:25:52] to prison or open cases for them?
[3:25:56] Never. Why?
[3:26:00] We are Christians. We are Christians.
[3:26:06] They are there. Amen.
[3:26:10] All right. Amen.
[3:26:18] from back there when it seemed my leg
[3:26:20] was troubling me.
[3:26:24] They were telling me even mentioning by
[3:26:26] names is that one and that one. Did I go
[3:26:30] there to bother them?
[3:26:42] Now I want you to listen, saints.
[3:26:46] As I'm closing,
[3:26:53] we don't go around telling people that
[3:26:55] they are witches.
[3:26:56] It is God saying they are witches. Amen.
[3:27:02] You know, Amen. But after after hearing
[3:27:06] that, we don't go to
[3:27:12] them. Amen. The Lord
[3:27:17] said, "We will even handle the harmful
[3:27:21] things.
[3:27:24] They won't harm
[3:27:29] us. Just watch
[3:27:33] me." I was in
[3:27:36] [Music]
[3:27:38] another mother. She was talking to
[3:27:42] another sister.
[3:27:44] saying,
[3:27:48] "Hey, I saw some witches in the church."
[3:27:51] Amen. Amen.
[3:27:57] And there's also God.
[3:28:02] Who's going to defeat the other?
[3:28:07] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[3:28:12] I didn't
[3:28:14] say can be if somebody's trying. No. No.
[3:28:21] I said
[3:28:23] yes they are there. Listen. I said yes
[3:28:27] they are there.
[3:28:29] Witches they go to churches.
[3:28:33] Amen.
[3:28:36] Even where Jesus was going. They would

[3:29:28] witchcraft.
[3:29:31] He's also trying his things. You don't

[3:30:08] away. I shall give you power. He
[3:30:11] said, "Amen. You shall overcome them."
[3:30:19] They must be
[3:30:21] there to
[3:30:27] prove. Amen.
[3:30:31] Even the other day they were telling us
[3:30:32] about them. Amen.
[3:30:36] Saying

[3:30:42] Amen. But should we leave the church and
[3:30:45] run

[3:31:05] practice their own things.
[3:31:10] Those that

[3:31:18] them from way back. That's
[3:31:23] why the other one
[3:31:27] was preaching underach.
[3:31:39] When they say we preach
[3:31:40] underworld, that's
[3:31:42] when we are talking about Satan.
[3:31:46] Now the witches, they say quiet.
[3:31:52] All right. Amen.
[3:31:59] He said we shouldn't be afraid of them.

[3:32:42] leg. There is others who were trying
[3:32:45] to take off my leg,
[3:32:50] but I won't report them.
[3:32:56] Jesus didn't tell me those that which
[3:32:58] bewitch you must. He said you'll
[3:33:00] overcome
[3:33:02] them. All right.
[3:33:06] Don't report the witch, but you must
[3:33:09] pray for
[3:33:12] them. There's no way you won't find a
[3:33:15] witch.
[3:33:18] Even them, they are practicing their own
[3:33:20] things.

[3:57:12] and said unto Peter, and to the rest of
[3:57:14] the apostles, "Men and brethren, what
[3:57:17] shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them,
[3:57:20] "Repent and be baptized, every one of
[3:57:22] you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[3:57:24] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[3:57:26] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
