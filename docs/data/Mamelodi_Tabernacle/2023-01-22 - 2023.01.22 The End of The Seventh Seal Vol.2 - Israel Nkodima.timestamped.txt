[15:23] sealed with seven Souls and I saw a
[15:27] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[15:29] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[15:33] to lose the souls thereof and no man in
[15:35] Heaven Nor in F neither under the Earth
[15:39] was able to open the book neither to

[15:45] man was found worthy to open and to read
[15:48] the book neither to look there on and
[15:51] one of the elders said unto me whip node
[15:54] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[15:56] the root of David have prevailed to open
[16:00] the book and to lose the souls thereof
[16:04] and I beheld and low in the midst of the
[16:07] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[16:10] midst of the elders stood a lamp as it
[16:13] had been slain having seven horns and
[16:16] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[16:19] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[16:22] he came and took the book out of the

[19:13] yeah
[19:15] I think we are all happy and
[19:21] spiritual mood
[19:25] you know I was I'm looking for
[19:30] what I had this morning off for
[19:33] speaking
[19:35] about the
[19:38] what do you you call that now
[19:41] this morning
[19:45] but I don't have it here
[19:47] but I will read from the book here
[19:50] I I want to start by
[19:54] reading to you this party
[19:59] um
[20:02] now
[20:05] there it is she
[20:09] scientifically
[20:14] let me start why it says
[20:18] talking about the life
[20:22] magazine
[20:24] packed a deducted cloud in the sky every
[20:27] live magazine is very
[20:30] uh it was packed not by any magazine but
[20:35] life is magazine
[20:41] that was that light in the sky is
[20:47] and a brother came here spoke about it
[20:52] but it seemed it didn't go well with
[20:55] some
[20:59] all right
[21:01] you know if somebody comes and say
[21:04] something
[21:06] maybe wait for an elder or the pastors
[21:11] to uh bring that thing okay
[21:21] the brother brought something about the
[21:25] cloud in the sky
[21:29] confused some people yeah
[21:33] all right
[21:35] but it didn't confuse me
[21:38] I'm confused even today I understand the
[21:41] brother
[21:43] and I know that thing
[21:45] will happen
[21:48] okay now the Life Magazine paint that
[21:52] part of that is uh
[21:56] closed in the sky girl a life magazines
[22:02] or look which one which was it look or
[22:07] Life Life Magazine
[22:10] look over our life all right
[22:13] now
[22:15] there it is scientifically
[22:19] prove that is the truth
[22:24] he is talking concern in that cloud
[22:29] so therefore we don't worry about
[22:32] whether it's truth or both
[22:35] scientifically and spiritually
[22:41] and what was said uh
[22:45] come to pass
[22:48] so the message of the Seven Seals in
[22:51] their closing that that's the message of
[22:56] the entire Bible
[23:03] the Seven Seals closes the New Testament
[23:15] amen no when the Seven Seals remember
[23:21] are revealed out it closes it's only a
[23:25] new testament
[23:28] okay and they sealed it up high sorry
[23:34] that's true now we know that
[23:37] that is by prophetic utterance
[23:42] even by a scientific End by the word
[23:50] okay amen
[23:52] is there somebody who has said what I
[23:55] have read here
[23:58] okay is there somebody who can keep what
[24:02] I have ready okay
[24:10] and there was the angels that sent back
[24:14] okay
[24:15] you're touching the Angels
[24:18] you know I was looking at this where he
[24:21] says
[24:22] the angels
[24:27] and they were coming
[24:29] eastwards
[24:32] because
[24:34] Where was the
[24:36] where was the Garden of Eden situated
[24:44] that's where
[24:46] God has put the men
[24:50] um
[24:51] now that's why when he saw these angels
[24:56] with the mystery
[24:58] they came Eastward
[25:04] because
[25:06] he should
[25:09] he should bring that message from the
[25:11] headquarters
[25:16] that's why even God before
[25:20] he could open the book
[25:23] he had to take his position on his or in
[25:28] his throne
[25:32] now talking from the throne
[25:35] the message is specially for the
[25:38] subjects
[25:42] you know yesterday as we were singing
[25:46] and dancing
[25:49] you could see some people living in from
[25:53] the neighborhood some drinking this
[26:00] each and everyone taking his own way
[26:05] all right amen now even today little
[26:08] hole for before the Lord can speak to
[26:11] his people
[26:13] he must
[26:16] oppositioned himself
[26:19] on his throne because
[26:24] his subjects but they will take nothing
[26:28] unless it is from the throne but
[26:34] now you hear many people talking around
[26:38] the world
[26:40] like this message everywhere you hear
[26:44] people singing but tomorrow
[26:47] you ask we are the message Believers
[26:51] I'm not saying anything against it
[26:56] but you listen to what I'm trying to say
[27:00] but the bride of Christ
[27:02] will never take any message from
[27:06] anywhere unless it is from the throne
[27:14] now it is if it is from a throne
[27:19] then it will be received by
[27:24] I the one that's on the throne
[27:29] I will say this scary yo
[27:33] the prophet of God says
[27:38] God has forwarded a throne into you
[27:45] if you are a predestinated seat
[27:49] then there's a throne in you
[27:53] because that that's how God's operated
[27:58] from Throne to Thrones
[28:02] and he has said also I was just reading
[28:06] that the throne or a throne can only be
[28:11] seen from the inside
[28:15] I mean
[28:17] and they saw that that's now let's go to
[28:21] this room now
[28:23] okay I was just looking at these things
[28:27] making ability and it won't take me a
[28:30] long time
[28:34] like yesterday
[28:37] so I've got several books here
[28:41] because now it's different versions
[28:47] and I'm still going to ask my brothers
[28:50] to sit together and put them in one
[28:53] version is
[28:58] but then for to save time
[29:01] I've heard them here but I marked them I
[29:04] will read them but we'll put them
[29:06] together don't worry
[29:10] um
[29:12] the mystery
[29:14] of redemption is sealed until this book
[29:19] could
[29:20] could
[29:22] all right
[29:24] the mystery from the
[29:26] back side I'm going to bring you that
[29:30] the mysteries from the back side
[29:37] this book could not be broken until the
[29:41] last Angel's message
[29:48] so we are looking at the the last
[29:50] message
[29:53] the last Angel's message
[29:59] then first we have Adam
[30:04] the book was in the hands of Adam
[30:07] the hand of Adam
[30:11] the scroll was there
[30:13] we knew it was there
[30:16] you know
[30:19] that's how it looked like in those days
[30:21] the Old Testament
[30:25] that's why they called it the role
[30:28] called
[30:35] the Lord Jesus when he opened that
[30:38] scroll
[30:40] the Bible says then he found
[30:44] a place
[30:51] and that place that's where it spoke of
[30:54] him
[30:58] and that's why
[31:01] if we roll up the
[31:05] Scrolls even today each and every one of
[31:09] us
[31:10] comes to a place that speaks of him
[31:18] because if you don't find it in the
[31:21] Scrolls
[31:26] amen amen each scripture
[31:32] you've you find the names of the people
[31:36] or your name now I'm trying to say okay
[31:40] if they pull up the scroll ever put two
[31:44] large Scrolls the Lord Jesus did in the
[31:47] temple
[31:49] the Bible says then he found a place
[31:56] amen amen you know brother ATC was it
[32:01] Mark 5 or somewhere there that scripture
[32:06] I think when he arrived there
[32:09] amen they gave him a scroll to reach
[32:15] then he stood up
[32:19] when he opened the scroll how will I
[32:22] scroll he found a place
[32:26] amen
[32:27] amen
[32:29] yeah if you can't find it I think in my
[32:33] Bible
[32:35] is it Mark
[32:39] 5
[32:41] look look not much God bless you sir
[32:49] say it aloud
[32:53] amen look at chapter four Luke chapter 4
[32:56] you are not Mark Luke 4 17. amen yes
[33:01] that's it Luke chapter 4 verse 17.
[33:05] and there was delivered unto him the
[33:08] book of the prophet isaiahs and when he
[33:12] had opened the book he found the place
[33:14] where it was written the spirit of the
[33:17] Lord is upon me because he has anointed
[33:20] me to preach the gospel to the poor
[33:24] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[33:28] to preach Deliverance to the captives
[33:31] and recovering of sight to the blind to
[33:35] set the at Liberty them that are bruised
[33:41] okay amen
[33:43] you know
[33:44] now the prophet tells you in those days
[33:48] it was a scroll evenly scroll amen
[33:54] and later
[33:56] compacted put together
[34:00] we call it the Bible
[34:04] now as he rolled and rolled the scroll
[34:08] yeah
[34:10] found a place meaning
[34:22] a person who is reading uh this now
[34:27] called the Bible he is looking for his
[34:30] place
[34:40] that scroll was handed over to him
[34:44] and then it was his opportunity now too
[34:50] roll up the scroll
[34:54] but but the mystery of it it says
[34:57] he found
[35:00] a place
[35:02] amen amen you know that's why every time
[35:06] I I I I open the books
[35:10] like I've got you you will notice that
[35:14] what I have found here in the books
[35:18] every time a preacher would come to
[35:21] preach
[35:24] he'll come to preach after he has found
[35:31] I'm a
[35:33] because
[35:34] every sermon is a place founded
[35:39] so as for to put the people in their in
[35:43] the right place
[35:47] nothing can put you in your right
[35:50] position
[35:51] without if it is not the word amen
[36:02] John Johan when he
[36:06] unfolded
[36:10] the scroll he found himself there we
[36:13] credit your farm amen
[36:18] the
[36:21] The Voice
[36:22] God bless you the voice of the one
[36:25] crying in the wilderness
[36:28] okay now he didn't say John
[36:33] it says the voice of the one crying in
[36:37] the wilderness okay
[36:40] but
[36:41] John has founded that Johanna
[36:45] to be himself
[36:50] that's how we read the Bible
[36:54] we find
[36:56] our place
[36:59] and when I look I said this is me
[37:03] I'm walking now
[37:05] uh brother Brandon knew that
[37:09] he knew that he is the missing the
[37:13] seventh angel messenger
[37:18] and I can't dispute it
[37:22] because I have also found my place
[37:29] now my place and his place
[37:32] then he becomes a prophet to me
[37:37] amen amen because I have also found my
[37:41] place
[37:42] you know if there's a star
[37:45] and these little other stars they find
[37:49] their places around that stuff
[37:53] when it is called a cluster
[37:58] all right now as we are here we are at
[38:01] last time
[38:04] that's why we can't differ
[38:07] we can hate one another foreign
[38:41] and then look now what happens
[38:46] when does that star appeared unto them
[38:51] not not unto any other person
[38:58] even if they could say to somebody
[39:01] do you see that stuff
[39:06] that someone would say um
[39:12] amen amen don't think that that star was
[39:17] visible to everybody
[39:25] all right I mean just like the
[39:28] Revelation
[39:29] is only for
[39:32] if you've got the Revelation
[39:34] it's for you
[39:37] that's what God has done to you okay
[39:41] I think I'm introducing let me look at
[39:45] this now
[39:48] now
[39:51] you listen tillage the Seven Seals
[39:56] closes the new
[39:58] testamentally
[40:02] all right amen
[40:04] and
[40:05] now I come to this this scripture
[40:11] I wonder I do oh yeah
[40:14] Revelation chapter five chapter five
[40:19] you know you wonder why the Lord came to
[40:22] the Earth
[40:24] it is because the first son
[40:30] forfeited the book will uh
[40:35] and the Lord had to come now
[40:42] could replace Adam
[40:46] he had to come himself
[40:51] now you you'll see here in the books
[40:55] that this message is not just
[40:59] a thing of reading cry for whatever
[41:02] and running maybe with a code
[41:06] it is amen
[41:11] amen it's a supernatural nerve Okay so
[41:17] yeah
[41:19] cowboy
[41:22] I'll tell you something
[41:26] I can say to you and got away
[41:29] okay
[41:30] if you have hatred
[41:33] but I can't take that hatred away
[41:39] because
[41:41] you should be the word
[41:45] now if you are not that word
[41:48] I can't take it away from you
[41:52] I can just preach it but it will still
[41:56] remain there because it is not there's
[41:59] no place for the way
[42:02] the Lord Jesus told the disciples
[42:06] who rejected him
[42:08] foreign
[42:22] now let's read and see if his weight has
[42:27] a place in you
[42:33] there's so many preachings
[42:35] so many teachings to change but the word
[42:39] of God is its own place
[42:44] I'm a
[42:46] we are not here just because of our
[42:48] preaching
[42:50] it's a call
[42:54] amen a call is the way that is part of
[42:59] you
[43:01] that has been revealed to him
[43:05] let me read it let me read it
[43:09] the scripture again brother you have
[43:13] read it look at chapter four look for
[43:16] amen they offered him
[43:19] foreign
[43:23] then when he
[43:25] found then it says then he found a place
[43:30] amen
[43:33] in the mode meaning that
[43:36] God offered us this book
[43:40] it's a book of our places
[43:44] each and every one of us should find his
[43:48] or her place
[43:50] in this book
[43:53] amen amen and when it is read
[43:58] now the Lord Jesus open it
[44:02] and it pinpointed him
[44:08] exactly treat who he is
[44:11] that was himself in that book yeah
[44:18] when he opened there he is
[44:25] I think you understand
[44:29] I read okay
[44:33] the mystery of redemption
[44:37] we are going to Revelation chapter 5.
[44:45] he said on the throne
[44:47] and had a book book written within and
[44:52] on the back side like I'm sealed
[44:56] amen amen so now usually but it was in
[45:01] the right hand side
[45:05] you remember the first time
[45:09] when I
[45:11] uttered these words
[45:19] some people thought thought it to be
[45:22] political politically
[45:25] but I was talking about the right hand
[45:28] of God
[45:32] and
[45:33] that's why to my brethren in Swaziland
[45:38] I always say to them
[45:44] amen amen to somebody
[45:48] they just keep quiet
[45:51] in South Africa because they think I'm
[45:55] talking politics
[45:57] but I'm talking about the Bible
[46:03] a typical swazi
[46:06] is talking about the swazi thing
[46:11] are you talking about
[46:13] the right-handed people
[46:16] and I'm talking about
[46:18] I'm not talking about
[46:21] you're right I'm talking about you
[46:29] I mean that's why you know everything
[46:32] was coming down
[46:37] until it reached the right hand people
[46:43] after he died
[46:47] he sat on the right hand of the Majesty
[46:53] amen
[46:57] when we look at him we say he of the
[46:59] right hand ah man amen now it's not as
[47:02] well to amen
[47:12] amen
[47:15] amen all right
[47:17] again
[47:20] um
[47:32] there is this baby
[47:43] um
[47:49] I was listening to
[47:51] um
[47:53] yesterday
[47:57] saying something
[47:59] and then I wondered
[48:03] yeah how did
[48:06] this thing
[48:09] reveal itself to him
[48:15] all right I won't say what the words
[48:18] that he has uttered okay
[48:24] let me read
[48:26] let us start now and
[48:33] God I'm studying here and I saw a strong
[48:38] angel proclaiming with a loud voice
[48:46] I need to open the book
[48:49] and to lose the seals
[48:55] right amen
[48:58] now remember we are open let's read the
[49:01] verse again first yes again so we can
[49:05] get it together
[49:07] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[49:11] sat on the throne
[49:13] cabinets
[49:17] then he says God who is that
[49:22] absolutely the original holder
[49:30] of the book or a book of life
[49:34] he holds it we say God does
[49:38] when Adam forfeited it
[49:42] it went back to his original owner yeah
[49:48] belongs to him but you know he gave it
[49:51] to Adam when he forfeited
[49:58] and
[50:02] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[50:06] on the throne
[50:08] took written within and on the back side
[50:15] with Seven Seals
[50:18] on the back side
[50:22] now if we are going to talk about the
[50:25] back side
[50:27] we are going to read the things here
[50:31] [Music]
[50:40] now let us go
[50:42] backwards
[50:45] because you can't find it when unless
[50:49] you go backwards
[50:53] I have tried to read some things here
[50:57] where it is the unveiling of God well
[51:00] one feeling of God it speaks of
[51:05] um I don't have it here
[51:08] but it says the the seals
[51:12] they speak of what what that was on
[51:20] when they opened Rahul they speak of I
[51:24] don't know you still remember
[51:26] I have read it not once
[51:29] that the opening of the seals they speak
[51:33] of what that was
[51:38] is that right amen now
[51:42] so we are going backwards
[51:46] if
[51:48] you know last only I don't have one uh
[51:53] what you call if
[51:55] you pay power so so
[52:00] if the word says in the beginning
[52:05] was the word now you know you know God
[52:09] has got no beginning
[52:11] in the beginning
[52:16] now you've got to take it back
[52:21] the word was
[52:26] God
[52:29] are you are you are we together in the
[52:32] beginning there was the way
[52:35] the word was
[52:39] I'm moving backwards
[52:41] [Applause]
[52:41] [Music]
[52:43] the way it was
[52:45] with God
[52:48] thank you
[52:48] then I'm still going back is
[52:59] if you properly
[53:02] want to read to read it
[53:07] you you you find yourself going back
[53:13] let me repeat to you in the beginning
[53:16] God has got no beginning
[53:22] and
[53:24] I've got that book still here
[53:30] what is the book called
[53:33] it's minus minor age
[53:40] I will read it again
[53:43] anything that had a beginning has an end
[53:48] this is Page 211.
[53:52] now he's running
[53:55] that's why God has got no beginning
[54:00] otherwise
[54:01] would be heading for
[54:04] the end of things
[54:09] anything that had a beginning
[54:14] because anything that had a beginning
[54:18] is a creation okay
[54:21] amen that's why my body yes and end
[54:25] because it's a creation
[54:29] I mean it's aging what too far
[54:34] no matter you can draw your future and
[54:38] what you want to do in the future
[54:46] what what will make you me to say to you
[54:51] even they want to say it's a future
[54:54] Refuge
[54:57] but the word of God says
[55:01] eternal life
[55:05] I mean man speaks of few his or her
[55:09] future
[55:11] God speaks of the eternal life
[55:15] that's the difference
[55:18] like I believe
[55:23] as they always saying
[55:28] I don't know what tomorrow will bring
[55:32] but I know the one who holds tomorrow
[55:37] foreign
[55:59] because God speaks of
[56:01] eternity
[56:04] okay amen God will never promise you
[56:07] something for tomorrow
[56:13] no oh
[56:15] he is
[56:18] eternity
[56:21] when they were in Egypt
[56:25] and he promised them the Promised Land
[56:31] he was promising them a place
[56:36] where he would speak with them for the
[56:39] further
[57:17] [Music]
[57:30] something that will take them further
[57:36] amen all right amen you see that's why
[57:41] that's why
[57:44] that's why I can't be a witch
[57:48] because it is drawing me back to hell
[57:54] but Christianity
[57:56] is taking me through
[58:01] eternity
[58:04] in these days that we are living in
[58:26] and all that was predestinated to happen
[58:30] in this day happened
[58:37] have you seen them okay
[58:42] well I was looking chemical Village at a
[58:48] it was I won't say where but
[58:51] the police were
[58:54] threatening somebody with arrests
[59:00] for wearing a t-shirt
[59:03] I think at the back it says
[59:07] it said follow Jesus or Jesus loves you
[59:11] something come from Jesus
[59:15] something about Villages and uniformed
[59:20] highly trained policemen but the police
[59:25] they were men two of them
[59:28] they wanted to arrest that man
[59:33] because yes
[59:36] Jesus loves you
[59:42] in a great country
[59:48] because it is
[1:00:01] she was praying
[1:00:05] because she was staying standing closer
[1:00:09] to a place where they performed this
[1:00:16] abortions
[1:00:27] going on now this woman she's praying in
[1:00:31] their hearts
[1:00:34] pertaining to this abortion that
[1:00:36] building there is
[1:00:48] no I'm just praying in my heart
[1:00:56] no because I'm standing before this
[1:00:59] place
[1:01:02] where they perform
[1:01:04] abortion abortions now where I'm praying
[1:01:09] Within Myself
[1:01:11] come with us the police station
[1:01:15] have you ever seen such as
[1:01:19] right I mean they were trained to do
[1:01:22] that
[1:01:23] now the Lord said these things will come
[1:01:27] you will be arrested for praying
[1:01:34] why you are praying
[1:01:38] okay
[1:01:40] I read
[1:01:43] oh yeah and
[1:01:46] anything that had a beginning are you
[1:01:49] listening yes
[1:01:58] if you start building
[1:02:00] you know that it is
[1:02:11] the end is also a company
[1:02:14] the end goes with
[1:02:17] everything of this world
[1:02:22] I mean if okay a child is born today
[1:02:29] that body has
[1:02:34] an end
[1:02:36] are you afraid
[1:02:39] all right
[1:02:40] if a child is born
[1:02:44] I'm I'm saying okay that body merely
[1:02:48] words
[1:03:19] I'm a
[1:03:22] you know even in buying a clothing or
[1:03:26] you say clothes or what
[1:03:29] you can buy one because
[1:03:32] it has an end
[1:03:35] you must there must be a replacement
[1:03:39] now even our bodies
[1:03:46] we shall put on immortality
[1:03:50] is that right okay
[1:03:55] um
[1:03:55] yeah you know this thing is I'm reading
[1:03:58] anything that at the beginning
[1:04:03] amen amen
[1:04:06] have you got that amen
[1:04:11] I'm saying
[1:04:14] anything
[1:04:15] that had a beginning
[1:04:22] I mean because it has a beginning
[1:04:26] now since God has got no beginning
[1:04:29] that's why he is and he is eternal
[1:04:35] but he is
[1:04:38] with him
[1:04:40] subjects
[1:04:44] now subjects of
[1:04:47] Eternity
[1:04:49] meaning they have no starting point
[1:04:56] amen amen
[1:05:01] and they have no because if it has no
[1:05:03] beginning it is
[1:05:08] all right I mean now
[1:05:12] look some some people can read the Bible
[1:05:16] and
[1:05:18] even say Pastor pray for me
[1:05:21] I feel I've realized that I've got no
[1:05:24] love
[1:05:28] then you pray
[1:05:30] he or she can even wipe tears from my
[1:05:34] face
[1:05:35] so you go Lord give him love
[1:05:39] but while saying God give him love
[1:05:42] the Bible says
[1:05:49] amen okay amen now how does God give
[1:05:54] somebody love now
[1:05:57] he makes you laugh amen
[1:06:04] a given thing it can get old and so far
[1:06:09] amen but now God instead of giving you
[1:06:13] that love
[1:06:14] let us make you he made you
[1:06:22] you can thank him for that okay
[1:06:29] like yes I may worshiper
[1:06:34] I do not say I worshiping
[1:06:37] no I worship in christophy
[1:06:46] this Tabernacle shall not stand forever
[1:06:51] you understand foreign
[1:07:32] here's your eternal life
[1:07:37] all right
[1:07:40] if it says he gave us eternal life
[1:07:45] that means we are Eternal because he is
[1:07:50] eternal
[1:07:54] you know brother Brendan says men and
[1:07:58] God
[1:08:01] say it came from the same place
[1:08:06] amen
[1:08:15] and he says
[1:08:16] they are one
[1:08:19] that's one today we are still coming to
[1:08:22] that result about mediation
[1:08:29] we touch it but you'll still want wonder
[1:08:33] and eat
[1:08:35] when it says prayer he is no longer a
[1:08:40] mediator
[1:08:43] mediation in back there in the old
[1:08:46] testamental was through the foreign
[1:09:23] with me
[1:09:25] good
[1:09:26] sorry
[1:09:29] but I'm coming we will read it okay
[1:09:34] let me let us finish this one
[1:09:43] God was not created
[1:09:46] he was always God there's no place he
[1:09:50] was created and the only way that we can
[1:09:54] ever have eternal life
[1:09:57] is to be part of that
[1:10:01] creation which is
[1:10:06] a creation that was not created
[1:10:13] all right
[1:10:15] I don't know if the only way that we can
[1:10:18] only turn our lives
[1:10:20] are feeling you say if if you stop
[1:10:24] smoking oh
[1:10:27] there's many non-smokers
[1:10:31] some people since they were born they
[1:10:34] have never smoked
[1:10:37] no you can't tell me it's eternal life
[1:10:42] the Bible never said stop smoking and
[1:10:44] you'll go to heaven
[1:10:48] you should be part of eternal life
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:10:57] and then it says
[1:11:00] the only way say you can ever have
[1:11:06] eternal life
[1:11:08] is to be part
[1:11:14] is that right now
[1:11:16] I mean that's the only way till I know
[1:11:19] to be party means
[1:11:22] because he is eternal
[1:11:25] he says because because
[1:11:29] I live
[1:11:31] he says because I live you shall
[1:11:35] literally usually
[1:11:38] yeah I mean
[1:11:40] do because I'm a son
[1:11:44] let's go back because I live
[1:11:48] you shall live Little P I mean and it
[1:11:53] says when he died he died with him
[1:11:58] when he resurrected we resurrected with
[1:12:02] him
[1:12:03] so he make sure that we are part of him
[1:12:07] in everything
[1:12:12] we are talking about the resurrected
[1:12:14] Jesus Christ
[1:12:22] all right amen
[1:12:25] I think I'm preaching the gospel
[1:12:30] no now let's read these things and close
[1:12:36] the the mystery of redemption is sealed
[1:12:46] that mystery was there
[1:12:49] in that scroll
[1:12:51] he knew it was there
[1:12:54] we knew that it was Redemption
[1:13:00] we believe it was Redemption
[1:13:04] now I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:13:07] with that is in the Bible there
[1:13:10] who is worthy
[1:13:13] to open the book
[1:13:17] and to lose the seals thereof hello
[1:13:25] and no one was found to be worthy
[1:13:32] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:13:35] sat on the throne
[1:13:40] God who is that absolutely
