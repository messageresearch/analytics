[1:27:20] everywhere B
[1:27:22] when the Bible is
[1:27:28] open
[1:27:30] David fought a great fight amen
[1:27:35] amen but when it comes to the
[1:27:38] end all the
[1:27:41] scriptures are connected to one
[1:27:49] scripture the scripture that closes
[1:27:53] so the
[1:27:58] seven the one that closes
[1:28:03] everything all right amen now I read
[1:28:10] here we reading and they were
[1:28:16] saying till today
[1:28:20] people we are
[1:28:23] every you go everywhere they will
[1:28:25] tell the seven seal is not
[1:28:29] open
[1:28:31] okay
[1:28:33] and but to
[1:28:38] those to others it is open and to others
[1:28:43] it is not
[1:28:46] open
[1:28:49] meaning there is those that it has been
[1:28:51] open
[1:28:53] and others it has not open to
[1:28:56] them all right
[1:29:00] amen now to them that to whom it is
[1:29:04] open they talk about it
[1:29:08] because to them it is open Amen to those
[1:29:13] that it is not open they don't talk
[1:29:15] about it because to them it's not
[1:29:20] open all right amen
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:24] and now when it is
[1:29:28] open the
[1:29:30] seventh
[1:29:33] last when that one is
[1:29:37] open then it means your eyes are open
[1:29:42] amen not this
[1:29:48] eyes let me
[1:29:50] reach
[1:29:53] You
[1:29:54] Know M hearing
[1:29:59] about talking about a
[1:30:05] man when it goes to the
[1:30:07] end we
[1:30:10] realize it talks Of An
[1:30:13] Angel and
[1:30:17] but there's still
[1:30:20] people who are still behind
[1:30:25] when it's where it talks of amen
[1:30:29] amen but when you talk to a person a
[1:30:32] human being with a with about a person
[1:30:35] about a human amen
[1:30:38] amen it's
[1:30:40] easy
[1:30:44] amen human if you hope if you talk to a
[1:30:47] human being about an angel about an
[1:30:50] angel it becomes so difficult
[1:30:56] if I say the seventh angel
[1:31:02] messenger
[1:31:04] then still I'm talking about
[1:31:10] aen then people can accept
[1:31:14] that but if
[1:31:18] then if I talk about the Lord Jesus
[1:31:21] Christ
[1:31:22] who came and became a
[1:31:26] man he took that
[1:31:30] form to be like
[1:31:33] you and have pains feeling pains like
[1:31:39] you then the
[1:31:41] people could
[1:31:43] understand yeah he a
[1:31:46] man but before
[1:31:49] that he was a
[1:31:54] Spirit then they
[1:31:57] couldn't see him or know
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:02] him then if you can't know
[1:32:06] him as a
[1:32:09] spirit you can't even know
[1:32:12] him as a
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:18] man those who knew Jesus
[1:32:24] men like
[1:32:26] Peter the Samaritan
[1:32:30] woman they have known
[1:32:34] him so you have known him in order to
[1:32:39] know
[1:32:42] him that's the
[1:32:45] difference some people are still
[1:32:50] struggling to believe
[1:32:53] him let alone to know
[1:32:57] him because you can't believe somebody
[1:33:00] you don't

[1:33:30] are what do you say to aen wizards
[1:33:37] Wizards amen amen now they don't know
[1:33:44] God because they have never seen
[1:33:50] God
[1:33:52] amen I was
[1:33:54] reading
[1:33:56] when I'm told in from that
[1:34:01] paper that so many people have sold
[1:34:05] their
[1:34:09] souls because they want
[1:34:12] money they want to be
[1:34:17] rich now they have never known
[1:34:23] or God let alone to understand
[1:34:31] God they don't
[1:34:34] believe that the end is
[1:34:40] coming you know a devil
[1:34:44] worshiper do not
[1:34:46] believe that there there will be an end
[1:34:53] to all in
[1:34:55] whatever he is involved
[1:34:58] in he believes that that is
[1:35:06] life
[1:35:08] but uh a child of
[1:35:12] God is a different
[1:35:17] being he
[1:35:19] knows that
[1:35:22] his
[1:35:23] time is
[1:35:26] short he is here just for a
[1:35:34] season you were
[1:35:39] born uh to
[1:35:42] reflect to show
[1:35:44] up who God
[1:35:49] is amen
[1:35:52] if you are a child of
[1:35:55] God you are
[1:36:00] born to show to the
[1:36:02] world who God
[1:36:06] is
[1:36:08] amen and his
[1:36:12] life all right
[1:36:16] amen every time you wake up in the
[1:36:20] morning
[1:36:21] the first thing you pray to
[1:36:26] God that's that's your
[1:36:30] life amen amen
[1:36:33] and I know that God will take care of
[1:36:39] me in
[1:36:45] everything uh this
[1:36:49] morning H I was
[1:36:51] one of my legs was this and
[1:36:55] that but I believed in
[1:36:59] God and said I'm going to the service
[1:37:04] because I'm a Child of
[1:37:07] God so that's why I'm
[1:37:10] here H you know if you are a child of
[1:37:14] God you know
[1:37:20] Goden and you
[1:37:23] know what God can
[1:37:28] do amen
[1:37:31] amen it's so wonderful to know what God
[1:37:36] can
[1:37:38] amen if you are a child of
[1:37:41] God a child
[1:37:44] means born of
[1:37:47] God he that is
[1:37:49] born of God
[1:37:52] does not
[1:37:55] [Music]
[1:37:57] say it doesn't
[1:38:00] say he who has
[1:38:03] repented he who has given himself to
[1:38:07] God
[1:38:08] says he that is
[1:38:15] born it is not a
[1:38:17] baby that decides his birth
[1:38:26] no
[1:38:27] so I have not
[1:38:30] decided to be
[1:38:34] born but it is
[1:38:38] God Amen that's
[1:38:41] right he gives birth to
[1:38:45] you it's not of your
[1:38:49] choice amen you can't choose to be
[1:38:56] born but
[1:39:00] God even I read where it
[1:39:05] says the
[1:39:08] Lord
[1:39:10] God gave birth to
[1:39:19] to in the books
[1:39:25] amen
[1:39:27] now if you are born of
[1:39:32] God and yet I'm looking at you you are a
[1:39:39] human but if you are born of
[1:39:44] God the body is
[1:39:48] [Music]
[1:39:49] human that's all
[1:39:52] just like
[1:39:55] everybody but the men
[1:39:59] inside is not
[1:40:05] human because the man
[1:40:11] inside was an
[1:40:15] attribute an
[1:40:17] attribute in
[1:40:19] God amen now every person who can
[1:40:26] sometimes
[1:40:28] think in this
[1:40:30] way that I am an
[1:40:38] attribute an
[1:40:40] attribute is not
[1:40:43] something trying to do
[1:40:47] good trying to be
[1:40:49] right no that's not an attribute an
[1:40:53] attribute is that
[1:40:56] a spiritual
[1:41:01] being
[1:41:03] born is in the form of
[1:41:08] God yet he is a
[1:41:11] man but inside of that
[1:41:14] man another
[1:41:17] man
[1:41:19] amen that's the
[1:41:24] difference uh that's why a child of
[1:41:29] God is not controlled by his
[1:41:35] senses
[1:41:36] no he is
[1:41:39] controlled by
[1:41:41] God
[1:41:43] am all right
[1:41:46] amen
[1:41:49] and you've heard me
[1:41:53] saying the
[1:41:55] people it's not the first time for the
[1:41:58] our neighbors
[1:42:01] here to say offer parking to your
[1:42:06] people but they don't even greet
[1:42:13] us it's not the first
[1:42:17] time but I tell you continue
[1:42:29] to how can they for to to greet them
[1:42:33] it's getting
[1:42:38] worse if they don't want us
[1:42:41] to they must just tell
[1:42:46] us amen
[1:42:48] amen should the person hear
[1:42:57] that who complained that the the people
[1:43:01] in this church they don't he end up
[1:43:04] saying I told you this is how these
[1:43:07] people
[1:43:10] are I'm trying to show you
[1:43:13] something all right but if a child of
[1:43:19] God that
[1:43:21] he feels bad that amen
[1:43:25] amen and he's the first one to go and
[1:43:28] say ah Mama I'm
[1:43:31] sorry for not greeting you maybe I did
[1:43:35] not see you or know you see the
[1:43:38] difference now this one is a child of
[1:43:41] God but another
[1:43:44] one and they canot for us to greet
[1:43:48] them now you see is that that Mama
[1:43:52] dealing with a mere human
[1:43:57] being not a child of
[1:44:00] God of course I've seen
[1:44:06] them who want to greet the
[1:44:09] people okay that is not our
[1:44:16] title now I
[1:44:19] read um
[1:44:23] it
[1:44:26] says let me start
[1:44:31] in that
[1:44:33] troes it's from
[1:44:39] God it fits
[1:44:42] exactly in the promises of
[1:44:46] God you know if you are a child of God
[1:44:50] you
[1:44:52] F in the promises of
[1:44:57] God from the
[1:45:01] End
[1:45:03] Amen of the
[1:45:09] message
[1:45:11] meaning you
[1:45:14] want get
[1:45:17] off because if once you are a child
[1:45:21] of if you are an
[1:45:23] African you are an
[1:45:26] African until the last
[1:45:31] day in the process you can try to die
[1:45:43] yourself always say sa
[1:45:48] sa whether you became White
[1:45:52] or you grow your hair until it hangs
[1:45:55] down
[1:46:03] Flor because to another
[1:46:11] African there's no
[1:46:14] way if you
[1:46:17] change die
[1:46:19] yourself do what
[1:46:24] else put highest
[1:46:35] heal but if you are a child of
[1:46:38] God you thank God for
[1:46:43] being
[1:46:45] amen that's
[1:46:47] right
[1:46:49] I'm I so thank God that I'm in
[1:46:56] Africa amen amen all right
[1:47:00] now let us look at
[1:47:07] this there is this part let me read for
[1:47:09] you and then we'll
[1:47:16] understand when all this are
[1:47:19] open
[1:47:22] an angel there is an angel
[1:47:25] of the Prophet the seventh angel
[1:47:31] messenger met an
[1:47:37] angel but he says the and the angel was
[1:47:41] very notable to
[1:47:48] me the rest of them
[1:47:51] just was seemed
[1:47:56] ordinary but this
[1:47:59] Angel was a notable
[1:48:06] Angel what does that mean you know
[1:48:14] in when the Bible says the
[1:48:19] in
[1:48:21] the inner man in
[1:48:25] you the notable
[1:48:33] one and you
[1:48:36] know you know that there is somebody in
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:43] you that's why your
[1:48:49] nature there are some
[1:48:52] people with a very different
[1:49:02] nature you listen to the people
[1:49:05] talking
[1:49:07] hear every time he
[1:49:13] says I don't want anyone to talk
[1:49:16] anything with
[1:49:17] me then you you start being careful to
[1:49:20] you can't go far with this
[1:49:23] one
[1:49:24] meaning when he's talking to
[1:49:28] somebody he has drawn the line
[1:49:33] already when that somebody says
[1:49:37] something you see these are the things I
[1:49:39] don't
[1:49:41] want be careful when you talk to
[1:49:46] [Music]
[1:49:48] me who are you you are you

[1:50:07] divine amen amen
[1:50:13] amen people not
[1:50:19] because to you somehow
[1:50:24] amen that's
[1:50:26] why I've heard many
[1:50:29] times a brother

[1:50:34] brother has a
[1:50:36] demon now when
[1:50:39] that a
[1:50:41] brother told
[1:50:45] me did I
[1:50:48] cry no I just say I know he's my
[1:50:52] brother amen then after that I met him
[1:50:56] at a
[1:50:58] wedding the very same brother

[1:51:27] Direction so he was trying to go that
[1:51:31] way I said my

[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:43] lion it's like this you know we as a
[1:51:46] children of
[1:51:48] God people should approach you as a
[1:51:53] lamb that's why the Lord Jesus called
[1:51:56] the
[1:51:58] lamb the L of
[1:52:02] God
[1:52:05] Amen you've never heard him
[1:52:08] say I don't want anyone to to talk the
[1:52:12] way he
[1:52:15] likes all right amen you know I'm
[1:52:18] talking I know this kind of
[1:52:25] people be careful of what you say to
[1:52:28] me until you are afraid of
[1:52:38] communicating you know when you see a
[1:52:42] lion you can't
[1:52:44] say I will
[1:52:48] approach yeah
