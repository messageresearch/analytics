[46:40] gracious heavenly father
[46:44] we like to thank you again this morning
[46:48] for being so kind to us lord almighty
[46:52] and preserve our souls
[46:55] keep it and preserve it
[46:58] and also preserve our spirits
[47:01] and straightening our minds lord
[47:05] to the perfect mind of our lord jesus
[47:07] christ
[47:10] we have gathered here once again lord
[47:12] thank you
[47:14] for the jobs and
[47:16] employments that you have given us
[47:19] to thank you father who are bringing
[47:21] back tithings back into today
[47:24] and the free offerings that comes deep
[47:26] down from our hearts
[47:29] i would like to thank you for that lord
[47:32] and we are here once again this morning
[47:36] with prayer requests heavenly father
[47:40] knowing further that the promise says
[47:45] by his strives
[47:47] we are healed
[47:50] and gracious heavenly father
[47:53] you said
[47:54] that
[47:56] without faith you cannot please god
[48:00] and we pray lord almighty that
[48:03] may you give us faith god to accept the
[48:05] healings of our bodies
[48:08] that everybody rather that
[48:12] has put on a request concerning
[48:15] any sickness
[48:18] what the prophet has taught us is that
[48:21] all sickness
[48:23] comes from the devil
[48:25] because when you created man
[48:28] he was a perfect man
[48:30] at the end at the end time he said be
[48:33] therefore perfect
[48:35] as your father in heaven is perfect
[48:38] so with that perfection lord almighty
[48:42] we come to the revealed word
[48:45] we come lord almighty
[48:47] to the revelation of the seventh seed
[48:50] which is the power of gracious heavenly
[48:52] father of the deadpool
[48:55] of which lord you said there's not even
[48:57] a single disease
[48:59] that will stand before it
[49:02] because the word now
[49:05] is in the bride
[49:08] and father we are so blessed to know
[49:10] that
[49:11] we know what to do with that word
[49:14] because we have just said the lord
[49:17] so the lord gave us a promise
[49:20] and we will receive the promise
[49:23] and father will be healed
[49:25] when we receive that promise
[49:28] may you heal them lord almighty so that
[49:30] they should come back lord and bring in
[49:33] thanksgiving gracious lord
[49:36] thank you father
[49:38] as usual we bind all
[49:41] the negative attitude of the devil
[49:44] to bind all the demons
[49:48] that are flittering around gracious lord
[49:52] that causes sickness in a human being
[49:55] so this is the time lord almighty
[49:59] when the power is given to the sons of
[50:02] god
[50:03] the revelations of the sons of god
[50:06] to perform and manifest that power
[50:10] so standing here lord almighty as your
[50:12] servant
[50:14] said the devil
[50:16] is null and void in this
[50:18] building here
[50:20] and all those that have requested
[50:23] the healing of their souls their spirits
[50:26] their bodies
[50:27] father may they receive it in the name
[50:29] of our lord jesus christ we pray
[50:32] amen
[50:39] god bless you
[50:43] some thanksgiving here
[50:50] who gave birth
[50:52] to a healthy baby
