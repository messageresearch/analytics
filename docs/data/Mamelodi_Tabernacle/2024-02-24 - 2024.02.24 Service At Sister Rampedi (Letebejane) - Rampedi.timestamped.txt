[44:53] home a very good friend Pastor when my
[44:58] the old lady was still alive she was a
[45:00] good friend to Pastor
[45:03] M if she would remember to go to the
[45:06] church
[45:08] in she would request for just one
[45:14] song amen
[45:20] amen I am being requested to speak
[45:24] about h
[45:27] it's a bit
[45:32] difficult to talk about in the flesh it
[45:35] will take me a long
[45:40] time I will start while she was
[45:46] still so it will be a very
[45:48] lengthy something to
[45:53] do but I will talk about that I have
[45:56] known from Heaven There are two things
[45:59] that
[46:03] characterize she is very
[46:07] persistent and
[46:11] persever those are the two things that
[46:17] characterize you know the prophet
[46:24] says the person who has God's promise in
[46:28] his heart is always
[46:33] perseverant and
[46:43] persistent Samson he saidon was
[46:46] persistent and
[46:50] persever as long as he can feel the
[46:54] locks
[46:56] of the
[46:59] hair then he was persever and
[47:06] persistent now with us we are persistent
[47:11] and
[47:14] persevering as long as we can feel the
[47:16] thir
[47:19] pool so that's what
[47:24] characterizes
[47:26] always the third when she will always
[47:29] feel the third pool is
[47:35] persistent everything that she
[47:38] [Music]
[47:39] does she will always look into the
[47:42] promise of
[47:44] God when she has got a problem with her
[47:49] kids she would always look at what the
[47:52] promise is saying I don't know how many
[47:54] times we came to this house
[47:59] all
[48:02] the if she would just see that if you
[48:05] just see some
[48:09] that she would
[48:12] call
[48:14] Pastor I need your
[48:18] help the first
[48:22] contct when she's happy whenever she's
[48:26] not

[48:38] she is always persistent and
[48:44] [Music]

[48:50] cons hours and you say the pastor will

[1:17:07] seated
[1:17:10] okay I have read the
[1:17:14] scripture in
[1:17:17] [Music]
[1:17:18] comparison with what H sister
[1:17:23] has
[1:17:27] done here the Bible speaks about a
[1:17:34] woman this
[1:17:37] woman had a
[1:17:40] man the man was
[1:17:43] old and this woman had no
[1:17:49] child and
[1:17:51] then this secret
[1:17:54] here was between Elisha and this
[1:18:02] woman why was Elisha frequenting the
[1:18:06] house of this
[1:18:11] woman and
[1:18:14] why did the woman say to the
[1:18:18] husband let us build
[1:18:21] something put bed
[1:18:24] there and a
[1:18:26] chair and a
[1:18:29] candle there was something burning in
[1:18:32] this
[1:18:34] woman now there was a p in
[1:18:40] Elisha but now
[1:18:42] Elish cannot just go
[1:18:45] there and expose what was in his
[1:18:50] heart it must come from the the woman
[1:18:55] itself and then this
[1:18:57] woman
[1:18:59] recognized that this is the man of
[1:19:04] God now let's leave that together and
[1:19:08] come to our sister Elizabeth
[1:19:12] here there's a py within
[1:19:16] her why is she consistently want a
[1:19:20] service in her house why
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:26] so
[1:19:27] she kept on pushing for more than 3
[1:19:34] years I mean she's every Sunday the
[1:19:38] service she hears the seron every
[1:19:41] Sunday why should we come
[1:19:45] here because she she she's at the
[1:19:50] service now it is it is
[1:19:54] because she
[1:19:57] wanted God to visit her
[1:20:03] home and then if she want God to visit
[1:20:06] her
[1:20:08] home now the question
[1:20:11] is are you
[1:20:15] God now that's what I want to to show
[1:20:20] you that you are God
[1:20:24] now your visitation
[1:20:28] here it's like
[1:20:32] Elijah when he visited that
[1:20:36] woman it was
[1:20:38] God visiting that
[1:20:40] woman you just saw a human
[1:20:44] being visiting that woman it was God
[1:20:48] visiting that
[1:20:50] woman now what was in that
[1:20:54] woman God saw it through
[1:20:59] Elish the
[1:21:01] man will wake up and go and
[1:21:06] plow he knew that is old
[1:21:09] enough he didn't have a son or or a
[1:21:13] child now he just
[1:21:17] satisfied it's how God want me to
[1:21:21] be but
[1:21:23] woman knew that if I could touch
[1:21:27] God God will do a
[1:21:30] miracle there will be Miracle with
[1:21:34] God she didn't just gave
[1:21:38] up
[1:21:40] no now if we
[1:21:44] continue verse
[1:21:48] 11 and it fell on a day that he came th
[1:21:52] and turned into the chamber and lay
[1:21:55] there now he came now he he will always
[1:21:59] go to that
[1:22:02] chamber so there was a day now he went
[1:22:05] into that chamber and laid
[1:22:09] there and he said to gazi his
[1:22:14] servant and he said call this
[1:22:19] shite and when he had called
[1:22:21] her she stood before
[1:22:24] him verse 13 says and he said unto
[1:22:28] him say now unto
[1:22:32] her behold thou has been careful for us
[1:22:38] with all this
[1:22:45] Care Now Elisha was not speaking
[1:22:49] directly to this
[1:22:51] woman
[1:22:53] no he was speaking
[1:22:57] toaz will speak to that
[1:23:01] man you
[1:23:05] see spoke to
[1:23:08] him then he spoke to me it was a thing
[1:23:12] like
[1:23:13] that now he didn't go directly to that
[1:23:16] woman and speak to that
[1:23:19] woman everything that he did
[1:23:23] he spoke
[1:23:28] to just like
[1:23:32] moseson so God will always speak to
[1:23:37] Moses and Moses will speak to
[1:23:41] Aon just like even in the
[1:23:45] church God will speak to the
[1:23:48] pastor the pastor will speak to the
[1:23:51] church you must remember that the church
[1:23:55] is the
[1:23:58] woman are we together okay let's
[1:24:04] continue we read verse
[1:24:07] 12 verse 13 says and he said unto him
[1:24:11] say now unto
[1:24:13] her behold thou has been careful for
[1:24:19] us with all this care
[1:24:23] what is to be done for
[1:24:27] thee would would has thou been spoken
[1:24:30] for for the
[1:24:34] king or to be to the captain of the
[1:24:38] host and she
[1:24:41] answered I dwell among mine I dwell
[1:24:45] among mine own
[1:24:48] people and he said what then is to be
[1:24:52] done for
[1:24:55] her and
[1:24:59] answered ver she had no
[1:25:02] child and her husband is
[1:25:06] old you see
[1:25:09] now there is the
[1:25:13] secret the secret is she had no
[1:25:17] child and she want a child but her
[1:25:21] husband is old
[1:25:25] are we together
[1:25:27] now that is why she
[1:25:33] invited the man of
[1:25:35] God so that the man of God could take
[1:25:40] care of her
[1:25:43] request all right that's what I want to
[1:25:46] speak
[1:25:47] about but I want to show
[1:25:51] you that the Bible say you are
[1:25:55] [Music]
[1:25:57] Gods your presence
[1:26:00] here brings God in this
[1:26:04] place and then the
[1:26:10] sister after your
[1:26:14] departure she will never be the
[1:26:18] same the thing that she was cing
[1:26:23] for she will
[1:26:26] receive if if it was the
[1:26:30] demon that was ping
[1:26:32] her that demon will never come
[1:26:36] back if there's something that she
[1:26:40] wanted she will receive it because God
[1:26:46] has entered a
[1:26:50] chamber are we together
[1:26:52] now the children of God according to the
[1:26:56] word of
[1:26:57] God they are
[1:27:00] Gods H they are gods in this
[1:27:05] manner they are they are the word
[1:27:08] potential God let me just find a
[1:27:12] word a place for you in the Book of John
[1:27:16] chapter
[1:27:21] 10
[1:27:22] Book of John chapter
[1:27:25] 10
[1:27:27] uh verse
[1:27:30] [Music]
[1:27:33] 30 you remember about our Lord Jesus
[1:27:40] Christ whereever he
[1:27:44] went then there is always a
[1:27:51] changes
[1:27:53] if he visited the
[1:27:55] house there'll be a change in that
[1:27:59] house remember he visited a certain
[1:28:02] house there was a
[1:28:05] prostitute and that prostitute took a
[1:28:08] very expensive
[1:28:12] oil and then and and smar his
[1:28:18] feet took her
[1:28:21] hair people were saying
[1:28:25] ah
[1:28:27] prostitute and that
[1:28:29] girl was no more the
[1:28:33] same remember he met the Samaritan women
[1:28:39] woman then she was never the
[1:28:43] same he
[1:28:47] met Mary
[1:28:50] and the one who who who lost a
[1:28:54] brother Lazarus sisters Martha and
[1:28:59] Mary after he left that
[1:29:02] house it was never the
[1:29:05] same where whereever whatever he
[1:29:09] touches was never the
[1:29:13] same now that
[1:29:16] thing now has been transferred to the
[1:29:20] church I will show you
[1:29:23] okay now John chapter
[1:29:28] 10
[1:29:32] [Music]
[1:29:36] uh you see what he says he he says I and
[1:29:40] my father are
[1:29:43] one now in other words he says he he
[1:29:48] said he is
[1:29:50] God and then then the
[1:30:02] 31 then the Jews took up stones to again
[1:30:06] I mean stones again to Stone him just
[1:30:11] because he says I and my father are
[1:30:20] one remember
[1:30:23] the
[1:30:24] ministry if it doesn't come to a
[1:30:28] point where a a a man becomes
[1:30:37] God then it's not a finished
[1:30:41] Ministry it's not a complete
[1:30:47] Ministry you know almost every
[1:30:50] Sunday the service there the pastor
[1:30:54] tells
[1:30:55] us that
[1:30:57] God created all
[1:31:00] things the last thing that he created is
[1:31:05] man then when he created
[1:31:08] man says that is the
[1:31:12] completion yeah now the
[1:31:16] Min of the seven
[1:31:20] SE
[1:31:22] it's
[1:31:23] when man is C I'll show
[1:31:27] you right verse 32 then Jesus answered
[1:31:31] them okay 31 they took up Stone 32 Jesus
[1:31:35] answered them many good works have I
[1:31:38] showed you from my father for which of
[1:31:42] these Works do you Stone me the Jews
[1:31:45] answered him saying for a good work we
[1:31:47] Stone thee not but for the blasphemy and
[1:31:51] because that thou being a man make
[1:31:54] thyself God and Jesus answered them is
[1:31:59] it not written in your law I said ye are
[1:32:03] Gods can you read it in our
[1:32:06] language up to
[1:32:20] verse
[1:32:50] for
[1:32:52] yeah now in verse 35 it says
[1:32:56] if or in 348 Jesus answer
[1:33:00] them and it is not written in your law
[1:33:04] and said ye are
[1:33:09] Gods what makes them
[1:33:13] God is the word because in verse
[1:33:17] 35 says if you call them gods
[1:33:22] unto whom the word of God
[1:33:27] came and the scripture cannot be
[1:33:31] broken now the word of God comes into
[1:33:36] you and then what when it comes to
[1:33:39] you it generates
[1:33:45] itself destroys the old
[1:33:49] man when it destroys the old old
[1:33:53] man and then the the seed of
[1:33:58] God like what the Bible says says now
[1:34:02] the word of God is the
[1:34:05] seed and then that seed germinate within
[1:34:10] you and then when that seed germinate in
[1:34:14] you it builds another
[1:34:18] man that that that that that man is is
[1:34:22] of the divine
[1:34:25] nature and what that man is is is
[1:34:29] reaches the
[1:34:33] completion then when he is divine reach
[1:34:36] the completion of
[1:34:39] divine then God
[1:34:43] anoints or adopts
[1:34:46] him and when he adopts him that that man
[1:34:50] become God
[1:34:53] let me show
[1:34:54] you Jesus was born a
[1:34:58] man and then when he was born a
[1:35:01] man and then he was baptized by
[1:35:05] John when he was baptized by John the
[1:35:08] day was baptized by
[1:35:11] John Heaven
[1:35:13] opened the spirit descended in
[1:35:17] him and God adopt him and say this is my
[1:35:22] beloved now as we are
[1:35:26] Christians we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:35:30] God now Sons and Daughters of
[1:35:33] God in which way there is
[1:35:37] a the supernatural Son of
[1:35:42] God and there's a natural Son of
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:47] God Christ is a son of God
[1:35:53] but a spiritual
[1:35:56] one Jesus is a Son of God but the
[1:36:01] natural one it's a
[1:36:04] body Jesus is a
[1:36:06] body where Christ comes and
[1:36:09] dwell when Christ comes and dwell in
[1:36:13] Jesus that makes him
[1:36:16] God now that very same Christ when he
[1:36:20] comes and dwell in you
[1:36:22] that makes you
[1:36:25] God together when the prophet
[1:36:28] says the word is now in the
[1:36:32] bride it means
[1:36:34] you are now the
[1:36:37] word in the beginning was the word the
[1:36:41] word was with God the word is
[1:36:45] God now if the word is God if the word
[1:36:49] is in is in the bride
[1:36:52] now this is the
[1:36:53] pride now this Pride God
[1:36:57] himself God himself is in the
[1:37:04] house together so you are God's visiting
[1:37:10] sister
[1:37:13] look let me read you something okay
[1:37:16] before I read that let
[1:37:18] me uh God
[1:37:22] visited
[1:37:25] Abraham God
[1:37:28] eloh but he was not in the spirit
[1:37:34] form it was a human being Abraham
[1:37:37] slaughtered the
[1:37:39] cow then God
[1:37:42] ate butter and bread he
[1:37:45] at but it was God visiting
[1:37:49] Abraham a human being being
[1:37:52] yourself visiting this house it brings
[1:37:56] changes in this
[1:37:58] house God visited
[1:38:01] Abraham after visiting
[1:38:03] Abraham then Abraham was never the
[1:38:08] same s was never the
[1:38:11] same
[1:38:13] situation around the house of Abraham
[1:38:16] was never the
[1:38:18] same Abraham could see things that he he
[1:38:21] didn't know
[1:38:23] about abah could see sod burning now you
[1:38:27] as the bride able to
[1:38:31] see able to see wrong things are
[1:38:36] happening are you together so now uh the
[1:38:41] other thing that I can I can quote I
[1:38:43] don't want to be
[1:38:45] long now you know when the Bible
[1:38:49] says without controversy you know that
[1:38:53] scripture first Timothy 3:16 it says
[1:38:57] without
[1:38:59] controversy great is the mystery of
[1:39:04] godliness it speaks about the mystery of
[1:39:10] godl it says it's a great
[1:39:14] one
[1:39:17] nowadays we were attending a funeral uh
[1:39:21] was with the
[1:39:22] elders I think it was
[1:39:27] Thursday we we we we saw it was myself
[1:39:32] and brother Manas who were looking the
[1:39:35] program then it
[1:39:38] says uh there are those who are in
[1:39:41] defense
[1:39:43] of what does it say brother it says
[1:39:46] defense
[1:39:49] of they say that defense defending the
[1:39:52] the
[1:39:58] ministry because the ministry has been
[1:40:02] diverted brother Bram didn't do this and
[1:40:05] this and
[1:40:10] this no I said in my
[1:40:14] heart how can you defend
[1:40:19] God look this is what
[1:40:22] happened there was a time when brother
[1:40:25] Bram was from a
[1:40:31] Pentecostal and then when he was in
[1:40:36] Pentecostal there was of course these
[1:40:38] media dresses you
[1:40:42] know you know them and then as time goes
[1:40:47] on then he preached the seven churches
[1:40:54] after the seven Church
[1:40:56] ages then he he went
[1:40:58] westwards met the
[1:41:01] Angels he came
[1:41:04] back you read this
[1:41:07] book my new
[1:41:09] ministry came with a new
[1:41:13] ministry that is the ministry of
[1:41:17] Angels the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:41:22] is the ministry of
[1:41:25] angels can you correct
[1:41:30] Angels correct
[1:41:33] angels
[1:41:36] look when when they were in the upper
[1:41:41] room they were at one
[1:41:44] Accord one
[1:41:47] Spirit the Holy Ghost will correct them
[1:41:50] if they are wrong
[1:41:53] wrong the ho Ghost came unto
[1:41:56] them because they one
[1:41:58] Spirit one
[1:42:00] Accord you can't correct that thing you
[1:42:02] can you cannot correct the Holy
[1:42:06] Ghost now immediately you want to
[1:42:10] correct the seventh seal seventh
[1:42:14] seal the seventh seal is God
[1:42:19] himself are trying to correct
[1:42:22] [Music]
[1:42:24] God are we
[1:42:26] together the seventh SE is third
[1:42:32] pool and then when the third pool when
[1:42:36] when when when when when Elohim visited
[1:42:42] Abraham it was de pool in Abraham's
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:48] house it it was God in Abraham
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:53] house when Abraham
[1:42:58] metc it was God meeing
[1:43:02] Abraham Abraham gave I
[1:43:08] mean gave of
[1:43:14] himself took
[1:43:17] MC and gave it
[1:43:19] to Abraham
[1:43:21] and Abraham took
[1:43:24] Abraham gave it
[1:43:27] to and they became one
[1:43:31] thing we together so now that's that's
[1:43:35] what the the thir pool is that's what
[1:43:38] the revelation of the seventh
[1:43:40] [Music]
[1:43:43] seed so when he okay now let's go to
[1:43:47] this
[1:43:49] one uh
[1:43:51] there was a woman called
[1:43:55] sister what what what sister R did it
[1:44:00] reminds me of that
[1:44:05] woman the like like I was mentioning the
[1:44:12] prophet
[1:44:15] [Music]
[1:44:17] Elisha there was something in the
[1:44:19] prophet Elisha
[1:44:22] which was in the shite
[1:44:26] woman and there was something in
[1:44:30] brother that was in
[1:44:33] [Music]
[1:44:35] Sister together there was something that
[1:44:38] was pulling brother
[1:44:41] Bram towards
[1:44:44] sister there was something that was
[1:44:48] pulling sister r
[1:44:52] towards the
[1:44:53] pastor because he will always P the
[1:45:00] pastor when are you coming to have a
[1:45:05] service what kind of
[1:45:10] service when are you coming for
[1:45:13] service should you come to the service
[1:45:16] you are at the service every Sunday
[1:45:19] why should we leave something in
[1:45:27] in now that's that's that's how it was
[1:45:30] with
[1:45:32] sister and then what happened he
[1:45:37] said
[1:45:38] says I
[1:45:41] looked I looked to
[1:45:45] sister and then he says the the first
[1:45:48] time it was ever performed on human
[1:45:50] being he's speaking about the third
[1:45:56] pool the third pool is when you speak
[1:45:59] things into
[1:46:04] existence are we together when you speak
[1:46:07] things into
[1:46:10] existence you know
[1:46:13] God
[1:46:15] created and God formed is two different
[1:46:20] things
[1:46:21] he created man in His
[1:46:24] image and then he formed Man Out of the
[1:46:27] Dust of the
[1:46:29] earth now when he
[1:46:31] created he spoke things into
[1:46:35] existence Let There Be Heaven and
[1:46:37] Earth there was Heaven and
[1:46:40] Earth now that's death pool you speak
[1:46:44] things into
[1:46:46] existence so now brother
[1:46:49] brother spoke squirels into
[1:46:55] existence that that is that that that is
[1:46:57] the third
[1:46:58] po so he says the it's the first
[1:47:03] time it was ever performed in on a human
[1:47:09] being he's speaking when when when it
[1:47:12] was on
[1:47:15] sister
[1:47:17] so then he said
[1:47:20] ask what you
[1:47:23] will God is going to give it to
[1:47:28] you so he said to this
[1:47:31] woman ask
[1:47:34] anything God is going to give it to
[1:47:38] you ask what you
[1:47:43] will then the woman said what do you
[1:47:48] mean then he said
[1:47:51] I'm saying ask anything your heart
[1:47:58] desires and it shall be produced right
[1:48:03] here now you see
[1:48:06] now why does brother Bram says it will
[1:48:09] be produced right here how does he
[1:48:13] know you you cannot go to a
[1:48:16] person ask anything
[1:48:19] now do now what if God doesn't do
[1:48:24] it unless if God has incarnated
[1:48:32] you it will be God speaking in you you
[1:48:36] yourself you
[1:48:38] never say to a person speak
[1:48:43] now we together that is why even
[1:48:48] Elisha said to that woman
[1:48:51] speak
[1:48:52] now what do you
[1:48:54] want
[1:48:56] until said she want a
[1:49:00] son ask anything your heart
[1:49:06] desires it shall be produced right
[1:49:10] here you will know that the Lord God Of
[1:49:13] Heaven answered and his scriptures are
[1:49:19] true
[1:49:23] now that was the first that that was the
[1:49:27] first he says my my first time with a
[1:49:30] new
[1:49:34] gift so the the third pool was a a new
[1:49:41] gift because God gave him that that new
[1:49:45] gift now my first time with the new
[1:49:49] gift first
[1:49:52] anointing I could hardly hear
[1:49:55] her she looked
[1:49:58] around we had been talking
[1:50:02] about right and then Ed looked around
[1:50:07] around and she said brother Bill my
[1:50:09] greatest desire is for the Salvation of
[1:50:12] my two
[1:50:19] boys
[1:50:21] God
[1:50:22] knew what he was going to
[1:50:28] ask God cannot ask you a
[1:50:34] question uh not knowing what you are
[1:50:37] going to
[1:50:39] say
[1:50:42] yeah so he continues and say ask
[1:50:44] anything you want to because God has
[1:50:47] given to me to give it to
[1:50:54] you whatever you
[1:50:58] want so now that that's how how it is
[1:51:02] [Music]
[1:51:04] now the word of
[1:51:06] God must come to the
[1:51:10] point where it create God in
[1:51:16] you and and when it creates God in you
[1:51:19] let's read
[1:51:21] John 6 when when it creates God in
[1:51:27] you then that that makes you an amature
[1:51:35] God
[1:51:38] now John chapter
[1:51:43] 6 from uh let's read from
[1:51:47] verse 62
[1:51:57] uh up
[1:52:00] to
[1:52:03] 64 it
[1:52:07] says what if you shall see the son of
[1:52:10] man Ascend up where he was
[1:52:15] before it is the spirit that Quicken it
[1:52:20] the flesh profited nothing the words
[1:52:23] that I speak unto you they are spirit
[1:52:26] and they are life can
[1:52:29] we
[1:52:48] 63
[1:52:57] yeah the verse 63 it it is the spirit
[1:53:02] that
[1:53:07] quickeneth the flesh profited
[1:53:12] nothing now the words that I speak unto
[1:53:16] you they are Spirit
[1:53:20] yeah right and they are
[1:53:24] alive do you understand the
[1:53:28] words they are
[1:53:31] Spirit now what is a spirit is a spirit
[1:53:35] that
[1:53:37] Quicken
[1:53:39] then what is to
[1:53:42] Quicken Quicken is to give life like for
[1:53:45] instance now we we are waiting for the
[1:53:48] rapture
[1:53:51] uh the Bible speaks
[1:53:53] about uh the the first Adam and the
[1:53:58] second
[1:54:01] Adam it says the first Adam was a living
[1:54:06] soul and the second Adam was a
[1:54:09] quickening
[1:54:12] spirit now a quickening
[1:54:16] spirit it's it's a spirit that will
[1:54:20] change your
[1:54:23] body you got a
[1:54:25] word and that
[1:54:27] word when it comes into
[1:54:31] you because it is life because the words
[1:54:35] are life like for instance I'll come
[1:54:37] I'll come back to that if you go to the
[1:54:39] book of
[1:54:41] Ephesians I'll come back to that one
[1:54:44] Ephesians chapter
[1:54:47] 1 uh verse 1
[1:54:51] in explaining that this this is what
[1:54:54] happens the Bible
[1:54:58] says uh the children of God does not
[1:55:04] sin because the seed remains in
[1:55:08] them and we know that the seat is the
[1:55:11] word of
[1:55:13] God we together now if the
[1:55:18] we is is the seed of
[1:55:21] God now the Bible says the word is
[1:55:27] life now when Jesus
[1:55:30] Christ said if you don't eat my
[1:55:35] flesh and drink my
[1:55:37] blood it was a
[1:55:40] confusion but what it really
[1:55:43] meant was that to eat the
[1:55:47] flesh the flesh types the
[1:55:52] we and then the blood types the the
[1:55:57] spirit now the
[1:55:59] word is quickened by by by by the
[1:56:05] spirit
[1:56:07] because what is what he said in in John
[1:56:11] chapter 16
[1:56:14] ver2 he said now I will send you a
[1:56:18] comforter
[1:56:20] then he will take from me and and and
[1:56:23] and and give to
[1:56:26] you you you yourself cannot explain
[1:56:30] it you yourself cannot understand
[1:56:34] it but I'll give you a
[1:56:37] spirit that will like I've opened up
[1:56:41] here Ephesians chapter
[1:56:44] 1 verse 17
[1:56:47] says that the god of our Lord Jesus
[1:56:50] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[1:56:54] you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation
[1:56:59] in the knowledge of him see
[1:57:18] amen
[1:57:33] yeah so what I'm trying to do
[1:57:37] here I'm trying to tell
[1:57:40] you that now you
[1:57:44] are a minor
[1:57:48] God now
[1:57:50] what makes you a minor
[1:57:52] God the revealed word in
[1:57:56] you makes you a minor
[1:57:59] God and then now I'm trying to say to
[1:58:03] Sister
[1:58:05] Elizabeth that you had a
[1:58:09] visitation from the minor
[1:58:12] God and then you had a
[1:58:15] visitation from the
[1:58:18] theop now the
[1:58:21] theop are Angelic
[1:58:25] bodies you are visited by
[1:58:29] Angels Abraham was visited by
[1:58:33] Angels so now you have visited you
[1:58:36] cannot you won't see them by your naked
[1:58:39] eye but is the life
[1:58:42] within
[1:58:44] them look we are waiting for the
[1:58:46] changing of our body isn't it
[1:58:50] how is our body going to
[1:58:53] change the word of God okay let me put
[1:58:57] it this way how
[1:59:00] did
[1:59:02] Mary gave birth to
[1:59:05] Jesus he received the word and when he
[1:59:09] received the we and then he believed the
[1:59:12] we and after believing the word and that
[1:59:16] word became blood in
[1:59:18] the then when it was a blood in the womb
[1:59:22] and then it created a
[1:59:25] being and then that being was a physical
[1:59:30] being which was Jesus the blood of God
[1:59:36] you have heard the word of
[1:59:39] God and when you believe the word of
[1:59:42] God and then what does it do within you
[1:59:47] it create a supernatural
[1:59:50] body when God
[1:59:54] descend descend to that
[1:59:57] Supernatural which is your
[2:00:00] theop that is your Supernatural
[2:00:03] body whever it
[2:00:07] goes
[2:00:09] light the devil cannot defeat that way
[2:00:12] that that
[2:00:14] body it's a body of
[2:00:17] light demons cannot that
[2:00:20] Bo because when they try to approach you
[2:00:24] they see the light that is in
[2:00:28] that are we together am so then those
[2:00:33] angels that have visited
[2:00:35] you it's just to be with
[2:00:38] you for some
[2:00:40] time to to boost the light that is in
[2:00:44] [Music]
[2:00:46] you so that you should stop
[2:00:49] rumbling you must know that there's
[2:00:52] light you you are the
[2:00:54] light you are the light you must sleep
[2:00:57] sleep I mean sleep well don't worry
[2:01:00] about any
[2:01:01] [Music]
[2:01:02] demon when there's a noise
[2:01:05] outside don't even
[2:01:08] worry the Bible says the angel of the
[2:01:12] Lord is encamping around
[2:01:16] you look when you pray
[2:01:19] you don't pray
[2:01:22] guessing you pray knowing that
[2:01:26] God you know that God knows you and you
