[23:36] our most gracious heavenly father
[23:41] this is the hour this is the time
[23:46] where father we have assembled lord in
[23:49] your tabernacle
[23:52] where father we know the bible says
[23:54] where two or three are gathered
[23:57] we know that you are also amongst us
[24:00] lord
[24:02] we like to thank you father
[24:05] for waking us up in the morning
[24:09] we are coming further from
[24:11] the sleep
[24:13] where the devil is active at night
[24:17] but the father we have come because we
[24:19] are the overcomers
[24:22] we have to thank the lord because
[24:26] the bible says jesus said i have
[24:28] overcome the world
[24:31] so our duty is just to manifest
[24:34] the power of the lord father that we
[24:37] have given unto us
[24:40] we don't have to worry lord
[24:43] because while the father is coming from
[24:45] the devil
[24:47] the bible says in the book of john 14 he
[24:49] says we must not worry but we must
[24:51] believe
[24:53] we must believe father
[24:56] in the son and believe in god because
[24:58] lord we know that we have overcome
[25:01] everything
[25:03] father this is your church this is your
[25:05] pride
[25:06] we have come to worship
[25:10] the prophet says father
[25:12] the tabernacle is a place of worship
[25:16] it's not the place of gossip
[25:19] it's not a place father of having
[25:21] meetings which are unnecessary
[25:24] but this is the place of worship
[25:28] we have come further
[25:31] to adore thee we have come lord to say
[25:34] up our father there is no one like you
[25:36] lord
[25:38] we glorify your holy name this morning
[25:41] father we give you the honor
[25:43] for lord you await it to be praised and
[25:45] you are worthy to be worshipped
[25:49] father we know that in the time where we
[25:51] are we are living in the times
[25:54] where the bible says father
[25:56] the seventh seed it means
[25:59] everything father is getting to an end
[26:03] father we can even
[26:05] hear when the pastor is preaching
[26:08] that now father is preaching towards the
[26:10] end
[26:12] and the lord we know that father
[26:15] when we are going towards the end for
[26:18] the rapture which is coming
[26:21] we know that father there are two seeds
[26:23] lord
[26:24] which which are fighting lord
[26:27] but jesus said just leave everything to
[26:30] grow together
[26:32] it will be seen during the harvest time
[26:36] father we pray this morning lord
[26:39] for those fathers who are depending
[26:41] father in this prayer
[26:43] that the father helped them up this
[26:45] morning
[26:46] we pray for this service father we pray
[26:49] for everything that is going to happen
[26:51] we pray father for our pastor we pray
[26:54] lord
[26:55] that you just manifest yourself lord
[26:59] the bible says father the pastor has
[27:01] mentioned that
[27:02] that lord joshua one day when he was
[27:05] looking preparing for the war
[27:08] he saw father a man who was standing
[27:12] the bible says he went to that man and
[27:14] asked whether you are of us or we are
[27:16] against us
[27:18] but the men said i have come
[27:21] my father
[27:23] as the host
[27:25] or as the captain of the host of the
[27:27] lord
[27:28] even this morning lord we know that it
[27:31] is an invisible god
[27:35] there is father michael is with us lord
[27:39] whatever the satan has planned for this
[27:41] service
[27:43] we know that father he is defeated
[27:46] because we've got an invisible man

[34:46] mayana who has a kidney the sister did a
[34:50] security course
[34:52] but the owner of the school did not
[34:55] submit the grades
[34:57] so as as a result
[35:00] she is not able to get the certificate
[35:04] so she is asking for a prayer so that
[35:08] the owner can answer the phone and
[35:10] submit the grades
[35:13] inaudible
[35:30] who is hospitalized
[35:33] and has a liver problem
[35:37] you know sister machade also asking for

[35:44] the sister has a continuous headache
[35:48] and at the same time the sister is
[35:49] working 45 hours
[35:52] per week
[35:54] on a contract and they want to
[35:58] degrade the hours to 25 hours
[36:02] so
[36:06] it says shalom saints my prayer request
[36:09] begins with gratitude
[36:11] as i ask
[36:13] of you of your lord to bless us with
[36:17] forgiving hearts
[36:18] and that the desires of my to no off
[36:21] i trust and have faith that you will
[36:24] fulfill
[36:26] i pray for god i pray for good health
[36:28] for my mom
[36:30] who is diagnosed with dementia
[36:33] lord i trust you will heal it
[36:36] i pray for my addictions to fade away
[36:39] and heal
[36:40] my mind from what that depression
[36:44] i pray for the job application that i
[36:46] have sent through
[36:50] father we know that thou art
[36:52] divine
[36:54] and your power is also divine
[36:58] and our prayers are always find comfort
[37:01] lord almighty
[37:03] in your ears
[37:06] so whenever we power our heads down
[37:10] and pray unto thee
[37:17] so we're going to have a registration
[37:20] list
[37:21] so if you want to accompany the pastor
[37:23] to that outrage
[37:25] you register your name
[37:28] so that we can prepare for the number of
[37:31] people that will be requested
[37:34] hallelujah
[37:36] the place is not far is here in cape
[37:37] town park
[37:39] at pastor david
[37:42] it's herbal
[37:45] so
[37:46] cajo pere
[37:50] i believe
[37:51] we all have the holy ghost
[37:56] you don't just drive to pastor david
[37:59] without informing us
[38:01] you know there is that tendency to say
[38:04] i'll make a plan when i arrive there
[38:07] you know last time the pastor was going
[38:09] to preach there
[38:12] the service was supposed to start at ten
[38:14] six o'clock the people were already
[38:16] flocked today
[38:18] so that is not correct
[38:20] because there are believers there
[38:23] that has invited the pastor
[38:26] we only have a privilege to accompany
[38:29] the past
[38:30] so for the love of our pastor
[38:33] we are registered we don't just drive to
[38:35] captain park
[38:37] hallelujah
[38:42] so we don't just drive to cape town park
[38:44] we register
[39:12] and priority
[39:15] for us
[39:16] is in detail
[39:18] hallelujah
[39:20] only the elders that are accompanying
[39:22] the pastor and the camera crew
[39:25] will be inside the tabernacle
[39:29] hallelujah
[39:32] praise the lord
[39:34] [Applause]
[39:40] it's happening
[39:43] i don't have to say more
[39:45] aleduya
[39:47] amen
[39:49] and
[39:50] we were supposed to have an outrage to
[39:52] swaziland on the same day
[39:54] the date has changed
[39:57] i believe is 21 and
[40:00] 22
[40:01] of may
[40:03] so swaziland will be on the 21st
[40:06] and the 22nd of may
