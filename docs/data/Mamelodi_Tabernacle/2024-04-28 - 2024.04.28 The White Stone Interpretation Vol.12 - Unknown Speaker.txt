Description:
Title: The White Stone Interpretation Vol 12
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 28  April 2024.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

Revelation 2: 17 |  Revelation 19: 11-13 | Ephesians 4: 30

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the Interpretaion of the white stone.

The bride is shaped like a pyramid.l, the seven church ages are in the form of a pyramid, and the new jerusalem is also in the form of a pyramid.

We come to church with a reputation that what God has started he will finish. Everything that was created has an end. 
The soul that is in you was not created. The day of redemption is the day the book was opened. When you see the mystery of that book then you see where you come from. When the book is revealed you then know who you are. The most miserrable person is the one who doesnt know who he is and where he comes from.

Satan can put a price on you but he himself can not pay it because you were bought by the blood of God. What is against the church is not a demon but is satan himself. You are sealed together with the book until the day the book is opened. No one, no satan can do you any harm. When you are redeemed even satan can do nothing with you. 

If you fear wizzards, witches and satan then you do not know God. If you know God you fear nothing. Satan is a being without the revelation of God. The greatest mystery is to know him. The greatest mistry is seald in the seventh seal.  When the mysteries are revealed you are also revealed. Those who came from the same place they will meet at the same place. The same place is the seventh seal.

I walk with the people who were revealed.The mystery is known to the people who were sealed with the book. When the book is opened it reveals the people who's name are in the book. When you know Christ you will know me. When the book is revealed we see one another.

If you are not with me today, how will you go with me in the rapture. If we are going together...

I think I must tell you things now let's pass here before I close H that book brother Ephesians Ephesians yes Ephesians 4:13 and grief not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption amen he now you are sealed until meaning that nothing will touch you until that's God speaking [Applause] if you are sealed of God who can be against you you are SE until the day of redemption the day of redemption now while you are sealed the prophet comes and say the day of that Redemption is the day the book of ss was red somebody has heard [Music] it you are sealed and again will come with that again you are seal with the book sealed with the book until the day the book is open so while you are seal with the book no power no Satan can do anything against you as long as the book is closed you are SE with the book now the day of redemption he says is the day that book is open and now when you are redeemed now Satan can do nothing against [Applause] you he you are ser until the day of redemption yeah that means nothing will happen to you you are SE nothing will happen to you until the day of redemption now the day of redemption and then I'll will come with that even this coming week the Lord willing if there will be next week next week amen amen amen where it says the day of redemption is the day the book was open meaning uh even before you were born you

here knowing Wizard and whiches we know but we don't fear them because we are SS hallelujah amen Sons and Daughters of God if you you fear Satan if you fear wi you you don't know God but if you are a son if you are a daughter of God you fear nothing amen they will come from the con River amen am instead God will give us it's not only the Mysteries as we say the Mysteries are open this book open all the secrets it shows you even those who are looking for your downfall you know them the book carries all that it shows you everything you know Judas Judas came leading uh the soldiers the mockers all those amen and what he did he kissed the [Music] Lord maybe something maybe somebody thinking that praise the Lord another one is converted today kissing the Lord but it was the kiss of death of death amen is like amen amen when is this thing dying the Bible says those that believe in him shall not see those who believe in him shall never see all right Satan sat is somebody it's a being without revelation of God Fallen now if you see this money rituals the people want money some kill even their children for tell me brother where are you going with money maybe today somebody can answer me where are you going with money where are you going with M you know I don't need money to enter Heaven but some people looks like their salvation is based on that for them to enter they need money a lot of many lovers the Bible says the root of all EV the love of money is the root now the root is the life of a tree a tree for a tree to live and even to resurrect again next summer what you call it it's because it has a me uhhuh amen now joh the root in your heart is [Music] [Applause] Christ let's go back to that scripture I'm closing Ephesians chapter 4 again yes amen and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption amen is that the Ephesians 430 read it again and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption now that's why brother says which we will read remind me next if I don't read that part where he says he speaks of the mystery beneath this seventh SE amen he says when that seventh seal is revealed it shows a great mystery now some people think that for a mystery you've got to read too much and read no no no no no no no the greatest mystery of them all is to know him now we even after here Serv I'll talk with you about it in the office there's only one miss the seventh seal it holds the whole plan of Eternity the plan of God if it is revealed to you then you know that the whole plan of God is been revealed to you he said shall I hide from Abraham the thing knowing that because he couldn't hide from Abraham because Abraham was P part of the Myst so he won't hide it from you because you are part of the mystery so when the Mysteries are revealed you are also being revealed Hallelujah [Applause] am brother when the mystery is revealed you are also when the Mysteries revealed you know why I'm with Pastor Mak because I walk with the people who were revealed who God has revealed because a person who is not revealed can say Amen to you and the next day he says to you and you will ask yourself whatever I done because this man we were together I baptize him I introduce to him the message but tomorrow he's against the thing is you didn't come from the same place you and that person those who came from the same place they will meet in the same place now the seven seal is the same place what does what the book says yes sir yes sir and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed to the day of Redemption all right remind me when we come into the office there because uh I'll have to bring the book with me the day of redemption Redemption amen amen and then the day the book is open the mystery is known to the people who are sealed with that book until now when the when the book is revealed it reveals the people who whose names are in that book but with these people when they are revealed they know nothing else because they are all in Christ if you know Christ you'll know me if I know Christ then I know you because all those who are in Christ when the book is open it reveals the whole thing and we know one another amen you remember the first time I heard about brother gab brother I call them my eternal Brothers I didn't see any color no I
