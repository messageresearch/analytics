[0:03] [Music]
[0:10] Amen.
[0:16] [Music]
[0:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; One day he was on his way
[0:43] to
[0:46] Damascus
[0:48] &gt;&gt; to arrest
[0:54] the only way God made a roadblock
[1:02] &gt;&gt; because
[1:04] that you know that is the mystery of
[1:06] predestination.
[1:07] [Music]
[1:13] &gt;&gt; A one time enemy
[1:18] god.
[1:20] He was his son
[1:25] of predestination.
[1:31] So he was coming
[1:34] &gt;&gt; talking about we must get rid of this
[1:37] Christian.
[1:40] Amen. Amen. Then God stopped him
[1:44] a light strike across.
[1:48] He stopped there.
[1:52] Then from there what did God say
[1:56] to him?
[1:59] Go to
[2:03] &gt;&gt; he will tell you
[2:08] &gt;&gt; because
[2:10] out of the contract.
[2:13] [Music]
[2:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; God had his people here.
[2:27] pray to him.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; That's the economy of God.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; Paul, he was blind.
[2:49] [Music]
[2:50] I've done this part.
[2:53] Another part there
[2:55] will do the rest.
[3:00] [Music]
[3:06] Amen. So he was going to
[3:08] &gt;&gt; blind
[3:12] him what to do and what
[3:17] amen.
[3:25] [Music]
[3:29] &gt;&gt; What did he do about it?
[3:34] &gt;&gt; Philip was somewhere.
[3:37] away.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; It's emergency.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Go down.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; Somebody
[3:53] on a chariot.
[3:56] So, Philip just
[3:59] appeared there.
[4:02] Hello sir.
[4:06] Yes sir.
[4:08] I'm struggling here.
[4:11] I'm reading about somebody here.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Who is this man?
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:19] &gt;&gt; You know these people. They never just
[4:22] read the Bible.
[4:26] While reading there was something in
[4:28] them.
[4:30] Who is this man?
[4:32] [Music]
[4:37] Amen.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; Who is he?
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Then Philip
[4:44] &gt;&gt; interpreted to him
[4:48] that this word was made flesh. He dwelt
[4:52] among us.
[4:55] And the man was baptized right away.
[4:59] He had just vanished. So the answer to
[5:02] that man was
[5:06] &gt;&gt; now in closing.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; We won't finish but we'll close.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; All right.
[5:18] Now we are still there. In the beginning
[5:20] was the word
[5:24] and we see now the attributes
[5:27] became words
[5:29] &gt;&gt; and they became persons.
[5:34] And this people when that word is made
[5:37] flesh
[5:39] [Music]
[5:42] and among that
[5:46] was a man.
[5:50] [Music]
[5:52] Amen.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; He was a man.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; That's why
[5:59] you
[6:05] because you can't see him from your
[6:07] mind.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; There was now a correspondence between
[6:15] him and Peter.
[6:20] They look beyond the human flesh
[6:25] and see that this is him.
[6:30] Now I read maybe you say
[6:35] you read this even before
[6:39] hold your peace and listen to the word
[6:41] of God. Even if you are sick,
[6:45] you know divine healing.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; Divine healing.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; If you come in here and you are sick,
[6:52] &gt;&gt; just accept the word of God.
[6:57] Amen.
[7:00] [Music]
[7:14] by his stripes we were.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; So you take the word of God
[7:24] and all other things
[7:29] will take their places.
[7:32] [Music]
[7:34] But one time
[7:37] &gt;&gt; there was this woman
[7:41] Some people believe that he became a
[7:43] pastor
[7:48] but not the
[7:50] [Music]
[7:55] part
[7:59] &gt;&gt; the Lord said
[8:01] &gt;&gt; okay I'll start here
[8:05] &gt;&gt; woman believe me
[8:09] The hour cometh.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; The hour cometh
[8:14] neither in this mountain yet worship
[8:17] their father.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; You worship you know not what
[8:26] the Bible said in those days
[8:30] was for the Jews.
[8:35] Our cometh
[8:38] And now is when the true worshippers
[8:44] that means there some false worship
[8:48] &gt;&gt; shall worship the father
[8:51] in
[8:53] spirit
[8:56] and in truth. For the father seeketh
[8:59] such to worship him.
[9:04] So God is a spirit.
[9:07] And they that worship him worship him.
[9:12] [Music]
[9:14] &gt;&gt; And now you must recognize this
[9:19] in spirit.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; And
[9:25] if you come
[9:27] in,
[9:30] &gt;&gt; then we say number one.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; Number one.
[9:34] [Music]
[9:41] We must look at this
[9:46] superal
[9:51] stood there.
[9:53] There was fire wind.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; He was just in the cave there.
[10:01] and the
[10:06] steal
[10:11] out.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; There was this wind
[10:18] &gt;&gt; earthquake
[10:19] &gt;&gt; earthquakes
[10:23] until there was a small voice
[10:28] and he walked out.
[10:30] Amen.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; Elijah stood there.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; You know how they
[10:37] prayed in dance,
[10:40] &gt;&gt; cut themselves.
[10:44] Elijah was Elijah was waiting for the
[10:46] right time.
[10:49] manifestation.
[10:52] He was waiting for a manifestation
[10:55] just
[10:57] so
[11:00] [Music]
[11:04] &gt;&gt; that's why these people
[11:06] they used to go into the synagogue
[11:11] [Music]
[11:14] and what happened they remain there
[11:18] looking for a manifestation
[11:20] &gt;&gt; manifestation
[11:23] until they said
[11:25] &gt;&gt; we have
[11:27] &gt;&gt; found him.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; So Elijah,
[11:31] &gt;&gt; he was not just taken by any of those
[11:36] stood there waiting for them.
[11:39] After that he said they were tired and
[11:43] he said carry on maybe
[11:49] somewhereing or what
[11:52] But the Bible says at the evening time
[11:58] [Music]
[12:00] of the sacrifice
[12:03] of the times
[12:05] in the time of the sacrifice
[12:08] he stood up and said
[12:10] you have prayed. You've done all your
[12:12] things.
[12:13] Now this is time to come on the scene.
[12:20] He started the altar
[12:23] and the water
[12:26] set up
[12:28] because he said to them, "We make altars
[12:32] here and put no fire.
[12:38] No fire.
[12:41] Keep your boxes away."
[12:46] Why?
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Because
[12:50] It was supposed to be the fire of God.
[12:57] [Music]
[12:59] &gt;&gt; You know,
[13:01] you know that
[13:07] God refused
[13:15] what happened
[13:17] from God.
[13:19] refused to bear the sacrifice of
[13:26] because it was according to his works.
[13:30] So Elijah stood there
[13:33] and said don't put fire to the sacrifice
[13:38] and the Bible says the fire came.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he knew the time
[13:51] &gt;&gt; and he knew God.
[13:57] [Music]
[14:00] &gt;&gt; This woman God speaking to a woman.
[14:06] Don't look down to the doctors of God.
[14:14] You know I like this.
[14:16] This woman was a prostitute,
[14:20] &gt;&gt; you know, a prostitute
[14:23] &gt;&gt; would go out in her shorts
[14:34] so
[14:35] exposing her body.
[14:39] That's a prostitute
[14:42] &gt;&gt; standing there changing some, you know,
[14:44] positions. People
[14:48] would be passing by
[14:51] and calling some names.
[14:54] But one day
[14:56] the beginning came.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; The one who knew everything from the
[15:01] beginning
[15:04] [Music]
[15:08] was the beginning
[15:10] of God.
[15:12] This was the beginning of the unfolding
[15:14] of God.
[15:17] [Music]
[15:19] We're trying to show it. We are still
[15:21] coming back to that father, son, holy
[15:24] ghost.
[15:26] Three persons
[15:28] but three dispensations.
[15:30] [Music]
[15:34] That's why Jesus said I am
[15:42] &gt;&gt; this I am
[15:43] &gt;&gt; I am. was in the beginning the word.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Now here he met this woman.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; I wish you could meet him one day.
[15:57] I
[15:58] &gt;&gt; met this woman.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; She came there to the world,
[16:04] &gt;&gt; you know, with
[16:06] pencil heels and so forth.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. and
[16:14] mercy was standing there by the way
[16:20] of grace.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; You cannot exhaust this grace.
[16:29] Amen.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Even a thief on the cross.
[16:33] Lord remember
[16:36] [Music]
[16:38] this night.
[16:41] I'll be with you in paradise
[16:44] of grace.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; Even those who pierce still
[16:50] father
[16:51] them
[16:53] &gt;&gt; they don't know what they do
[16:56] full of grace.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; So they met
[17:03] then he said they
[17:06] can I read this last part.
[17:11] God bless you for that. The woman said
[17:14] unto him,
[17:16] &gt;&gt; I know that Messiah coming
[17:20] about it
[17:23] was taught in the church. So I know
[17:27] Messiah

[18:26] So she kept on doing prostitution
[18:31] waiting for the
[18:35] &gt;&gt; drunkers

[22:50] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus never said anything about
[22:52] prostitution.

[36:35] the woman
[36:37] [Music]
[36:40] they never meet her pastor
[36:42] they went to him

[36:50] &gt;&gt; when they were come

[37:42] &gt;&gt; You read this thing at home. My time is
[37:44] nowhere
[37:46] and many more believed on him because of
[37:48] his own.
[37:54] Because if you don't accept his own
[37:56] word,
[37:58] You go around setting the way that would
[38:01] suit your life.
[38:06] Amen. Amen. Amen. Like this Jesus is in
[38:10] the heart

[38:30] &gt;&gt; hearting.
[38:34] [Music]
[38:36] Amen. Amen. But Jesus
[38:40] is like a lion coming to you saying
[38:44] don't worry about this man
[38:48] in the heart
[39:02] to
[39:04] worry about this and what
[39:10] [Music]
[39:12] Can you believe that?
[39:16] [Music]
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Now after
[39:20] last
[39:21] &gt;&gt; and and many more believed on him
[39:25] because of his own way
[39:27] and said unto the woman,
[39:29] &gt;&gt; now we believe
[39:36] men.
[39:38] Hallelujah.

[39:44] on him also the saying of the word then
[39:47] they went further.
[39:51] Amen. Amen. And they said now they
[39:54] believe
[39:56] because of his own word
[40:00] of the women
[40:02] they have passed that
[40:06] &gt;&gt; right
[40:07] &gt;&gt; you know if you believe you hear this
[40:09] one
[40:11] &gt;&gt; and you you pass
[40:14] &gt;&gt; you you go to the next stage
[40:20] &gt;&gt; in the promised land promised Amen.
[40:23] Yes sir.

[40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; You go in stages
[40:27] &gt;&gt; until you come in the present
[40:31] and said now
[40:36] [Music]
[40:38] you can go back and say
[40:44] we have found him.
[40:48] It is not like I like that church.
[40:54] It has got so many young people
[40:57] and the people can see
[40:59] that's something else we are talking
[41:01] about.
[41:08] I perceive you the one
[41:13] thing. Now this is the last thing. And
[41:16] they said unto the woman,
[41:18] &gt;&gt; "Now we
[41:20] &gt;&gt; believe,
[41:20] &gt;&gt; we believe,
[41:23] &gt;&gt; not because of your sake,
[41:26] &gt;&gt; for we have heard him our
[41:30] [Music]
[41:33] Can you say amen to
[41:38] that verse 42?
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Not because of you now.
[41:45] that people would say,
[41:48] "Yeah, you know, she's the one that
[41:50] testified to me." You know,
[41:53] &gt;&gt; when she leave the church, they follow
[41:55] her and so forth.
[41:59] You must go beyond that.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; So,
[42:06] we have heard him ourselves
[42:10] and know that this is indeed the Christ.
[42:14] Savior of the world.
[42:18] This is half of it
[42:21] from the beginning
[42:23] just came on.
[42:26] Amen.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; So let's just stand up.
