we know it's during the week some from work and we need to rush home no we won't belong can somebody just borrow me watch while we are opening The Book of John chapter 10 verse1 17 we uh like to be with the family here and the neighbors too and the friends also we just want to be with you in reading some few scriptures uh for the word which comes from our creator for a a specific reason uh John chapter 10 verse 17 can you read it it reads as follows John 10:1 17 amen let's let's bow our head Mighty God Eternal Father you came down Lord Almighty and restored us to our Supernatural life and you made us Lord Almighty through your word that's why when we pray we say you are Mighty because you've given us power Lord to O overcome uh all Spirits because you are father of all Spirits amen and father you're the king of King and you've made us King your bride Lord Almighty as we have just read one verse here this evening before we depart Lord we just came over here to be with the family to have some few words amen which I believe Lord Almighty we invite you to come and share with us in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen okay Believers it's it's one of uh us that has departed I'm sure you are all aware that it's departing time now we are it's a type now you know that the the the natural type the the spiritual it's almost a month every every uh week we uh have a uh somebody to BU I'm sure you are with us okay I've got some problems here ohen oh all right sorry know the sisters were not stable possibly they were seeing a snake now now we have taken care of it you can relax now yeah brother Harvest has got it is in his pocket now I was wondering why what are they pointing down all right fine now relax the snake is dead all right what what I was saying is that the the the the natural types the spiritual now we are living at the end time we have the message of the hour which is the end time ministry which is we which has to do with the bride himself and then the opening of the weight itself now after the word has been opened and and revealed there's nothing be beyond that in other words now after the end of this Century or after the end of this dispensation is uh the dispensation of the Gentiles then actually we it's now at the end we are entering now uh another life and which is another dispensation of the ministry of angels we are entering into eternity right the time and the signs are telling that we are entering another dispensation now the dispensation that we are in it has to do with the son of man and then and the manifestations of the sons of God I hope you understand what I'm now here our Lord Jesus Christ says therefore uh does my father love me because I laid down my life I lay down my life that I might take it again uh what what does your Bible say okay but I wanted this way it says I lay down my life do you understand amen that I might take it again that's what I want to talk about that will be my title now Jesus Christ said I laid down my life so that I must come again and pick it up and then in the book of Timothy you don't have to read it because it's late we just going to be a in chapter 3 verse one the the Bible says this know also that in the last days dangerous and hazardous time shall come then in verse 5 it says it's speaking about the people that will be living during this time and then he says uh there will be having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof now the power is what we call the the the the revealed word now this brother brother signy brother syney was also part of us as the bride but what made him a bride uh it's not his flesh what made him a bride is that now he received the we and then after receiving the weed then he didn't stop there he continued and then received also the revealed weight so now that very same we that he he received proceeded to be a revealed word now that revealed word made him the bride of Christ and then being the bride of Christ then he was able to conquer dead natural death by that we and when the time come that he should depart it's not a matter of departing not knowing where you are going right now Before you depart there is the Gathering there's a Gathering Place for departure are we together amen now even spiritually uh there is a Gathering Place now We Gather in the revealed word of God before we depart if you depart and going uh to some other places you need to go maybe to the airport or to to the bus stop or to the taxi rank now you wait for your transport there are we together now even spiritually before the departure the departure that I'm talking about I'm talking about the the Rapture now all of us everybody every Christian is speaking about the coming of the Lord even songs they sing about the coming of the Lord now everybody knows that the Lord is coming but let me say that now you have to know that there should be a Gathering Place uh before you could uh start your journey right now the word of God is the Gathering Place it must be the one that gathers you and make you one thing are we together and then after you are one thing that very same word then it becomes the revealed word now the revealed to it is the word that gives you Faith which we called rapturing Fai now that rapturing faith is what we called a seventh seal or the revelation of the seventh seal where you receive the faith of changing your body of which you cannot understand by a human mind that that very same word that is within you it has got a seed and that seed has got life within it are we together now that that word which is the seed then must germinate in you now that that is the one that will bring about the rapturing faith in you because now it's no more your mind now it's your your Supernatural or your divine nature now you change your nature then it becomes that of divine now our brother here when we say he he was one of us as the bride even now he is still a bride are we together now the bride of Christ is the revealed weight and when that weight is revealed then it makes you part and parcel of God and when you are part and parcel of God then you have now uh the the faith of God it's God himself that speaks to you and revealed himself unto you when Paul said I Know a Man in that heaven now he saw that man and he know who that man is but he kept quiet for 14 years because even if he can tell you you'll be in another dimension then he'll be telling you things of another dimension now when somebody depart it it depart to another dimension of which we preach about that Dimension and when we preach with with that dimens okay let me say when you are when you are about to go you go to a Gathering Place a departing place then from that departing place then you receive the departing order you go to that place it could be an airport could be taxi rank it could be a bicycle rank but there is an order there is an order if if it's a flight you got your ticket it has got a ticket number and then in the time of departure and the time of arrival where you are going are we together now that types now the spiritual one before you could depart there is an order before you could be raptured there's what we call a rapturing f the order in which you are going to be raptured and then you you get your ticket number you get your code before you can be raptured now the code and the ticket number it's a rapturing faith that is in you you will be the one the Bible calls it your new name the Bible says it's a a hidden Mana it's it's a Mana but it's hidden look when Israel was about to leave Egypt they went somewhere they were not uh scattered anywhere they went to specific place where it's only the Hebrews that St and they went they waited and then they got an order from Moses through the angel of the Lord how is going to be the their departure they were given an order before we departure this is what you should do you slaughter a lamb you take the blood and smear smear it are we together now all those orders of how you eat that lamb and doing like that that was an order before the departure and the angel was introduced to them you cannot be raptured without the angel being introduced to you there should be an angel that is introduced to you are we together and then when you know that angel you will find that that angel is yourself are we together because this body is from our parents all together it's a temporary body but there is a supernatural or Divine body that comes from eternity that will came and engage this body then when it engag in this body there will be a time when this body because it comes from the dust it will go to the dust but the spirit says we who are alive there are those that will live there are those that will live before there are those that will will be alive until the other one resurrected are we together now we are living towards that era we're living at the last time there are those that go before us like brother sign he went before us but some of us maybe you are also one of them wait until the changing of your body even himself he will come and wear his body then after wearing his body then that body will change just like our Lord Jesus Christ the body was in the grave but after Resurrection there was no body in the grave so there won't be your body here your body will will be changed are we together now when the Lord says I lay down my life so that I could come and take it again which means then he had a power then where is the power if you read uh the book of First John I mean the Book of John chter 1:8 the Bible says it says no one knows their father it's only the son that is in his botom are we together that declares him now when when Jesus Christ was through with what God want him send him here for now you have to know that you are here for a purpose are we together if you don't know the purpose then we are in the wrong direction everybody that is here or on Earth he should know the purpose of being in this earth and after knowing that he should know whether he's doing the part that he was sent to do Christ was God himself then when God was processing himself he needed a body because God is a spirit now God being a spirit he had a body which was Jesus now Jesus knew knew that his father which was Christ in him want he knew what he should be doing and then he knew the purpose of him being born now you should know the purpose you were born by your parents but there's a greater purpose above what your parent want you to do that is why when he was preaching and Mary arrived and his brothers arrived and they would say to him there's your mother and there's your brother then he would say my mother and my brothers are this because now I am about my father's are are we together now he was aware and when he was finished with what he's doing he was aware that now I am through now when you are through with what God want you to do in you must be aware that now I I am through you know there was a day when Jesus uh because it's during the week just take some few minutes you don't have to open your Bible read it for you we we'll read it the two of us you write it down I say our Lord Jesus Christ when he was through with what he was sent to do in the book of St John chapter 17 in verse one he says these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come now can you tell God that the hour is come right now when God has revealed himself to you it will be himself speaking to himself when Jesus was here on Earth he was speaking about the father he said the son do nothing except me except he sees what the father want him to do are we together so now it it was the father doing in him it should be the father doing in you now he says father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify you now who is glorifying who he says glorify thy son so that thy son can glorify them so it's one and the same person it's just now in this dispensation he was for a specific purpose now even you yourself in this dispensation it is for a specific purpose even brother himself he had a purpose God has a purpose about him are we together when God had a purpose about him he knew that God had okay there was a time way turned blind the eye could not see but we are all aware that now the eye is not the real thing that sees the ey is just a camera but what the eyes see interpreted by the brain that's why we have blind people that that are even clever than us are we together we we brother Antony and then the service I'm sure we are more than a thousand but but anony could recognize the voice of each and everyone if he can speak to you and know who you are then even if you call him he will before you could say how are you he would say how are you you see now to saw that now there is a mind that interpret that but I'm not there now now our Lord says glorify th thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee you should come to the point look there was a time when Moses send uh Joshua and Caleb to spy the land right they went and spy the land but in spying the Land There was a promise from Moses that you Caleb there's your place Moses didn't go there Caleb went in there and recognize his his in inheritance and then he spoke to to to Joshua and said do you remember I was with you we went and SPID the land do you still remember my place are we together now you should know your place now your inheritance you are not here without a purpose God didn't bring you here without a purpose remember that your inheritance is eternal life that is why Jesus was not worried about going to Calvary he want calv even the disciples were trying to stop him then he would say get out of my way you Dev because he was on his way to to Calvary to lay his life down so that he could take it up again we together that is why after I took it up he said I was dead now I am alive I have the keys you see of death and hell do you hear what it means he's got all the keys now he says I laid my life down so that I could possess what is mind the Bible speaks about the the the the Overcomers that you cannot be called an overcomer without fighting and winning that battle that makes you an overcomer now we cannot worship a God that could not defeat the dev and we cannot say we are the children of God being persecuted by the devil we know where our power is are we together so now he continues and say I'm going to jump in verse four he says I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou Gest me to do you hear what he says I have finished the work that you that thou Gest me to do now each and everyone of us is given a work to do you should be there should come a time where you are so brave to even tell God that father I have finished the work you you you you you are not just a church goer you are a possessor are we together amen now you must know actually what you should possess don't measure Yourself by yourself that's what Paul says we have a measurement and then don't fight against an air don't don't make a Shadow Boxing you must know who your enemy is are we together amen right in verse five again it says and now oh Father glorify thy thou me with thine own selfy me oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self in in other words he says father become myself become myself so that I want to be God that's what the Bible says that in the last days it will be you remember John 14:20 you know it yeah so now there's a time in in John 10:30 10 he says I and my father are one in John uh 14:20 it says in that day you shall know that I am in the father you in me an i in you now he says an i in you then you should know that he is in you and then when he's in you then you claim that because you are in me then I am yourself that's what Jesus said he says glorify me with th own self right with th own self in other words you should become God okay they saying what does this old man want to say okay what I'm trying to say the man which used to be called syney you won't find in heaven you won't find in heaven and you won't find the muas in heaven the m is just a temporary name that like yourself the name that you are having is a temporary one the Bible says he that overcometh I will give him to eat from a hidden man and then I'll give him a white stone and in that stone his new name new name new name now it's not that somebody a new name you are restored back to where you come from are we together now the restoration has a scripturally happened we have been restored now that we have been restored we need to go now and go and have h a supper with our Lord we have to change this body and wear another body and go for the Lord supp after the restoration are we together and then from there on will be with him in different dispensation until eternally are we together no now what is called death it's a useless power the thing that is called death you know if you go to Hebrews chapter 2 verse 14 says ver he became a man so that he could fight death so that those that are bound by death those that are afraid of death should be relieved are we together amen death has got no power it's just a departure of a saint going home it has it can have a power it it can have power if you reject the word of God let me quote another verse Mark 8 uh verse 34 says and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also then he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me see now he whosoever will come after me let him deny himself that's what my brother did he denied himself and took his cross and and was baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and received a Ministry where he could depart not everybody could depart if you sit in your house and say uh you won go to to you will be saying you want to go to town until you stand up and go to the tax rank then you'll be on your way to town but but to say I am going to town but to say I want to go to heaven sitting on your rock rocking chair there is a venue there is a place the message of the hour of departure if you want to go you you go to that Tex R the message of the the Bible says behold I will send you Elijah theh before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord that's why the Bible says in our time he will change the heart of the what you call of the children to their fathers they once ask our Lord Jesus Christ watch should we do to keep the word of God you know what he said he said you should believe the one that is sent there's somebody who God will send look during the time of our Lord Jesus Christ everybody was saying messiah messiah messiah all the priest the Pharisees the sagues they say the Messiah until John come John was the one that would say behold now anybody that denied the ministry of John could not meet the Messiah because John saw him when the spirit descended in him even in our time wait in order that you should see the second coming of Christ you should listen to what the Bible says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he will turn your heart he will turn the heart of the Lans it's the end time he will turn the heart the people of this world together to that of our fathers to the ministry of Paul and then from there on then you will meet the angel show you Ministry of your hour are we together the ministry of your hour is that you should go he will show you the station where you have to stand and wait for your departure are we together with the Revelation with all the power with all the knowledge with all the understanding with all the faith are we together that's what brother sign did he waited at the right station having the right knowledge having the right understanding yeah I am at the right place yeah I'm going home even if he was sick he knew that this body this body cannot inherit the kingdom of God he knew about that because he was they called him mud Ms I mean knew that this body cannot inherit the Kingdom of Heaven you should know that your body will never inherit the so there's a body that will inherit the kingdom of so now we don't have to worry about the departure of brother we will be with him we will be with him within a blink of an eye the time and the signs are telling he denied himself and take up his cross that's why he said now that's why Jesus said I will lay down verse 35 said Mark 8:35 said for whosoever will save his life shall lose it whosoever shall save his life then he shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the peoples is the same shall save it so now if you want to save his life Proverbs chapter 8 verse 35 835 it says he that found me has find life now he has find him he has find life if you find the word of God then you find life verse 36 verse 36 for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul can I repeat that for who shall I mean what shall profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own life and 37 he said7 or what shall a man give in exchange of his soul there is nothing that you can do to exchange your soul your soul your soul is your life and your soul was not created your soul was processed from God now if it was processed from God what was created was just body then what shall a man give in exchange because the soul itself it's the soul itself you cannot exchange it are we together your body is just a place where your soul lives you can't exchange it the owner of that soul will the one is the one that will bring back the soul to himself when God created I mean formed a Man Out of the Dust that man had no soul and until God breathe a spirit and then after he breathe the spirit then God took his own soul and put it in that man and Man became a living Soul are we together amen and when man backlighted took back his soul to himself together and then now what what has happened he has brought that soul in the form of the word in the process he gave you Faith he gave you V he gave you knowledge he gave you Temperance patience godliness brother kindness and say this one is complete and then he took his soul again and give it back to you so now when you depart the soul goes how together am he's got a prepared place a prepared dimension where he keep your soul that's your real you now that's your real body now are we together that one does not age that one isn't got gray hair no no how we together I know it's during the week let me stop here may the Lord
