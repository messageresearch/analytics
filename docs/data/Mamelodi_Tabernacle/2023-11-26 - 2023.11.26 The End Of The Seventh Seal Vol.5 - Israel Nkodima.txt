Description:
Title: The End of The Seventh Seal Vol.5
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima on 2023-November 26 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Revelation 8:1,
Revelation 19:16, 12 and Revelation 22:11.

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about The End of The Seventh Seal.

There is a name that is only known by the Lord, the name only known to himself. To know that name you need to receive the revelation because that name is only revealed to you by revelation. 

We have heard from our Theophany. You hear because you have heard. A person who hasn’t heard from his Theophany will not hear anything. A true predestined seed of God, doesn’t hear the word here for the first time, a true Christian has heard.
A perfect man is a person who has eternal life. 

When you are a child of God, you have another body that is waiting for you, when you depart from this body which gets old. 

He who hate his brethren is like Cain. Anything that can’t be moved away from you it is rooted in that person. 
The gospel is not preached to your head, it is something that you have heard from your Theophany.  You should be able to hear from God not from the preacher.  The Language of God cannot be heard by ears. 
Having eternal life means you have accepted the message from eternal being. 
The Pastor quotes the following spoken words:
65-0221E - Who Is This Melchisedec? Par 88
63-0324E The Seventh Seal Par 78

Rock but many [Music] left amen amen that's why we have the seventh [Music] seal uh but many left and people are leaving because there's a white stone some remain [Music] look now here is the brother's a quotation from Brother ke now he says as brother I want call the name spoke brother this is brother gabri saying as brother spoke how they saw their own reflection in there now in Revelation 2 verse 177 the P Church age it speaks of being given a white stone with a new name written now if you know somebody Maybe maybe the name is Israel or Abraham or so forth now if he is given a stone with a new name written which only he that receives knows only he that receives that name you know in the Book of Revelation where it speaks of that name of which only the Lord know that name now meaning he is called by a name that is known only to himself and for me to call that name I must first receive a revelation because that name came by Revelation known only to [Music] him do you know where it is in the scripture where Revelation 11 11 re 11 11 I thought the whole community of heaven knows about that scripture he has a name Revelation chapter 19 sorry I to say 11 that is 19 19 you know let me H uh let this pass first there's some sisters here Brothers I was supposed to greet some is long time I met them now they will understand that at the end of the service I will still

verse 12 okay yes thank you sister his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns amen and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself amen amen amen all right that's that name God bless you now we I I I I'm not going to be because we are we still have got some many miles cover if but I I will start also by saying to you uh there's a part here A Part here that speaks of the Lord how those that are his it says here after like after you recognize the word of [Music] God that it was an eagle food that's brother then you left the other thing you have been formed into a living image of the Living God then he comes to uh this great part then he says you have heard from your say it if this if if yeah be with me you have been formed in the IM Living Image [Music] amen

brothers Gabriel they cting that place where it says you hear because you have so if you are a child of God you understand you hear because you have heard if you haven't heard then you don't hear then that is who is meis page 88 one all right amen now we are going to look into these things you will hear what you have heard only fa yes amen now should you say I don't hear I don't hear this what is this seventh SE amen it is because you Haven but the one he amen okay amen that's where the thing is the god that we worship I is not a God that we can say this time and that at this time we can continue to ask what is this seven SE amen amen Paul speaking he says we speak these things to and brother Bram says a perfect man is a man who has eternal life and I said yes my Prophet a perfect man is a person who has eternal life a person without the who has got no eternal life he can be perfect because what perfects him it let him that is Holy be holy still because uh I'm looking at this roof here it's white let it be white still I've never heard somebody say we should repaint it and change it color all right amen h i will preach for only for a few minutes but we are trying to set up the things that we are going to pick up along the way you'll have the people who have heard from their theop who will guide us saying you see this was amen there was a brother he said to a brother who is here and said you know I can take you to gol I'm I'm talking about the brother who is here he was told and uh I didn't dispute it because today they are searching for the exact place where go was now if you ask the people historians and so forth they will take you to different places they all will say yeah it was outside the city then they bring you to a certain place the other one also come they only knew that it was outside the C where the Lord was crucified but to point out the exact they right amen but that man said to my brother the brother is here is listening I can take you to go I don't know whether the brother understood the man not but I understood that man what he meant I can take you to amen amen then after that he started to speak of the ancient amen so mean he was talking about somebody he [Music] knows whom he has seen back there all right amen only I I I asked my brother tell this brother I would love to meet [Music] him but he wouldn't agree something to the brother we believe that when we see brother Peter brother Paul brother Philip phip we going to recognize them because we were together that's why I want to worship with the people I have seen before the only preacher that I can hear as a [Music] preacher amen not because of spoken isn't yesterday he read another spoken word no you know the Lord said uh to men who were around him living go here and preach the gospel to all the world how can they that means everywhere the gospel is preached they are part of that they are there amen amen if you are not sh when Paul was working but you can hear him preaching today hallelujah amen amen amen we can introduce To You Paul [Applause] today is that right that's why he says you have heard from your it's not a new thing to you amen a true predestinated seed of God he doesn't hear the weight here for the first time it is what he has amen okay you have heard from your if this Earthly body he dissolved yeah amen you know this body uh dissolved because this body is smoking things amen amen and the inside is the what you can say tell me you know every day men can men can travel many many kilometers per day and can hear many many many things from talking to somebody you can hear many many things today talking about the the gospel I I I I I I have listen to Peter his record but to believe Peter it is because I was there and you are there amen as brother says when Paul preached I was there that's why I believe because I believed amen what Paul preached amen amen I don't think God will use somebody to impersonate PA no it will be somebody who was there if you were there when Paul preached in that synagogue or in that Temple you have him there now today you are in this one you can still hear Paul you have heard now brother you have heard from your the that's the real hearing for even now I'm talking uh I'm struggling every time to remind the people of the title amen meaning when I pronounce the title this person was not there this person was not there so after you say what is the title because the title didn't come from the head okay amen what does that mean it depends where is or where are you amen are we before we close now we are going to listen to things that the ear has not hurt amen PA what does Paul says in that scripture brother Paul Paul Paul knew that the thing that that I preach is the thing that was H amen and preacher to the perfect that's Paul no ear has hurt do you have it is there one with it let's let's continue let me it says no ear has hurt if you have heard amen you then it means you have heard from your theop now that's why more now that's where here we're not talking about ears amen amen the gospel re it's not when a person talks to you I can't hear sorou please it's something that is inside the heart amen amen you can speak louder What My Title is this now you find the person that is here is not listening to you or he's not hearing you what is that he s here the ears are even clean but you can you amen he can hear now now we are going to talk about things that cannot be by the ears amen there's a language of God that cannot be heard by ears amen even that title cannot be listened to by the [Music] ears because you have heard from your amen okay amen uh let me read something I'm watching my time I'm going to close but we are just preparing for to go somewhere before you can go higher you go am say the very Lord that went down he is the same one that ascended up above all to cover cover did you hear that we will read it also very same one that went so high is the same one who went deep deep down all right amen right we've before we close now you are going to realize when Jesus spoke one day I am from above and you are from amen but why the people dispute that underworld under under what is this is it not there in the Bible is it not there in the spoken word no such a big cry what is it haven't you read that they is the underworld there's another under of the people that says they working underworld and you find there police looking for them that one the people believe it they say yes it's there but if you come with this one of the Bible now you're causing a big fight if I can read it again it will still be the same now listen before we the thing that people can that's why it says you from your a person that has not heard from you can repeat one thing he will never believe it amen and in most cases to reject a thing it is because if you are not if you are part of Christ how can you reject him no if you are part of him if you are part of the word of God cannot reject that because you are made by that weight amen I'm still looking for I asked for it amen it says he that is filthy let him be filthy still amen amen Revelation chter 22:1 amen he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy Ste and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still amen we'll come and read to you H what the prophet has said about [Music] this he that is filthy let him be filthy still he was referring to a Ty a certain time when he that is filthy will continue to be meaning it is taking things from the roots that's why it says if you see a tree you see a big tree you don't actually see the what is the actual tree is hidden under as life when you see a person living a righteous life you don't see you don't how how can this manage to live such a life while we're not Str but you can't live that kind of life now let me tell you something let me say to you the Bible says one who hates his brother is like k meaning that once let me say you you hate your I'm just giving a CH or you even have a list of those that you hate and you have this one I hate because and this one is because amen amen and then you take the Bible and go to the the very it says one who is like amen any and you have it you're working with it do you believe they ask you now what do you me what's written in this book yes why not but to tell the truth I believe some of the not everything like when it says if you hate your brother yes there's one that I hate because when we hate we actually hate the behavior of a person that's what we hate there I don't want to lie to you amen even God there's things that God cannot tolerate at [Music] all that's why he bends them he's going to bend them with fire amen amen amen that's what they call hatreds did you hear that why why can't it move from you leave you it's because it has got roots in [Music] you anything that cannot move from you rooted it has Got Roots now the one who preaches he preaches you can even see the tree shifting like this the thing is this thing has rots amen that's right if you take or take a tree out and they say it's m who planted that brother it's okay so those who knows they say you must uproot it from the The Roots if you cut it you've not done anything does not preach you the head am you have heard from [Applause] your this is the things we are going to talk about while we are still alive I've got them line up we still are going to the White Stone because this white stone one the the prophet spoke of it one time what that's why I called it flying interpretation you'll see it we come there brother gabrion also spoke of that stone you know in this book H I think I won't start now it because it will take me somewhere we wanted to say you here because you have [Music] time you listen to this as we we are closing from the from the seven6 I wonder if I've got the right book how many have heard this quotation the seventh seal what what about the seven SE spoken of from the very beginning in Genesis that we are going to hear things it's not a thing of today no spoken now the person who has heard that is called theop amen I'll read you again brother say we were in God's mind righten you know if I can put you in my mind you'll be able to say I've heard everything about him from from him amen okay amen don't worry I dropped something I'll be able after [Music] if I can take you and put you in my mind amen amen now you will hear everything amen will come to those things hey we've got things here amen you hear people say there's a bigal coming and then and then people go and they come back then it finishes amen Big Revival is coming amen now I realize for the real real one those who were in his [Music] mind amen is great you have heard now you say I from let me tell you you have not heard from then you have not a preacher loud speaker he is just [Music] amen [Music] amen but the person hear from God because if is a human being and you hear from we are lost we know we want preachers but Eternal [Music] preachers if I have eternal life it is because I have received this message from an eternal being eternal is that right amen okay amen a being I can you can't even Trace unless you were there that's why now you really can hear of this seventh season if you have not head from
