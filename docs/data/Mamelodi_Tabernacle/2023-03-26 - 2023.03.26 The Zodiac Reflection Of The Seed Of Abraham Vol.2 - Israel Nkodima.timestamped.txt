[34:53] they love the way he could express
[34:55] himself
[34:59] they still need you how he used to

[35:11] the world
[35:12] [Music]
[35:13] we will come again
[35:16] there's an episode we're going to do
[35:21] it's from these people
[35:25] breaking down people being sent to get
[35:29] things and find things and we have
[35:32] audios
[35:34] videos of these people who have been
[35:38] sent on commissions to
[35:42] authenticate this this man who has a
[35:47] message from Underworld Kingdom
[35:50] foreign
[35:54] what was the other part that I might
[35:58] have forgotten you that this ministry
[36:00] trying to remind himself of things
[36:07] and later on that particular
[36:11] there was a monkey
[36:14] [Music]
[36:15] it was don't run away please there was a
[36:19] monkey
[36:21] it was some funny strange
[36:25] key creature
[36:27] foreign
[36:28] [Music]
[36:47] man then was busy carrying this
[36:51] particular thing with him over uh
[36:55] with him over with one particular other
[37:00] lady
[37:01] [Music]
[37:07] the last part
[37:08] yes
[37:11] talks about something
[37:14] it's very much calculated
[37:19] that is what I am saying that he is very
[37:24] much calculated
[37:28] very much manipulated
[37:31] and then you can see that that is why
[37:36] even the people that are in the message
[37:39] of
[37:44] I I mean in the message of the hour
[37:49] they we we have learned their hard way
[37:55] I mean we have learned the hard way
[37:59] in order to understand
[38:04] but now chicken because
[38:07] chicken is
[38:11] chicken
[38:13] I think that is what what is he coming
[38:16] through yeah but now chicken because are
[38:21] coming to roost
[38:28] Young man think judgment is coming or
[38:31] whatever
[38:33] now you understand this is not the court
[38:36] of law
[38:39] no it's not from the court of law
[38:43] is from a self-styled group
[38:46] is
[38:50] right I mean
[38:53] uh
[38:55] where am I
[38:58] coming home to roost
[39:00] they mean now things are coming
[39:03] for this then
[39:07] we can we can make a separation between
[39:14] the message
[39:18] is preaching because even though
[39:23] the message church and what in God my
[39:26] spirit
[39:28] because even though whether we can
[39:32] disagree
[39:36] with what brother
[39:38] foreign
[39:42] [Music]
[40:08] and also this man
[40:15] is
[40:17] totally two different things
[40:26] are you saying amen amen
[40:30] oh

[40:34] from one brother Abraham preached
[40:36] [Music]

[40:47] or the last part
[40:53] where's this where is it where is this
[40:57] cake and coming from I must read the
[40:59] whole thing come
[41:01] the complete thing

[59:02] there will be a conflict
[59:05] because there's different Revelations
[59:11] the Lord Jesus is supposed to have one
[59:14] chance
[59:18] now it is
[59:20] it is until you
[59:22] know which one is
[59:27] now his important brother before you
[59:30] reach
[59:33] Genesis stating from verse 5 to 10 yes
[59:38] and not also which went with Abram had
[59:41] flocks and heads and Tents and the land
[59:44] was not able to Bear them that they
[59:47] might dwell together for their substance
[59:49] was great so that they could not dwell
[59:52] together and there was a Strife between
[59:55] the headmen of Abram's cattle and the
[59:58] headmen of Lord's cattle and the
[1:00:00] Canaanites and the parasites dwelled
[1:00:03] there dwelled then in the land and
[1:00:06] Abraham said unto Lord let there be no
[1:00:09] Strife I pray thee between me and they
[1:00:11] and between my head men and thy headmen
[1:00:15] for we be present amen is not the whole
[1:00:19] land before
[1:00:22] you can carry in a bit it's not the
[1:00:25] whole land before being separate thyself
[1:00:28] I pray thee from me right
[1:00:31] amen okay
[1:00:35] the land could not keep them together
[1:00:42] but their substance
[1:00:46] this one had his own substance
[1:00:53] amen and that caused the conflict
[1:00:58] until Abraham decided to
[1:01:27] are you listening
[1:01:30] Papa
[1:01:50] and one day the pastor can call for a
[1:01:53] meeting
