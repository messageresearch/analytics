because they are under a cabinet [Music] and the name will as you have prayed for me amen this afternoon I would suggest that the elders they will find me home and so that we can you know Fellowship a bit look into the program God bless you okay I want us to or visit the Covenant you know and that will be Genesis you know where the company is Genesis chapter 9 yes from verse 11 to 15. and I will establish my Covenant with you uh let's start Genesis chapter 7. verse one two three one two three genesis chapter seven one two three and the Lord said unto Noah Come Thou and all thy house into the ark for they have I seen Russia before me in this generation of everything Beast thou shall take to thee by servants the male and his female and of beasts that are not leaned by two the male and his female or false also of the air by servants the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the Earth Amen Let Me let me also look into this chapter seven all right this from verse 1. right three says two of every clean Beast thou shall take to thee by seventh right amen and then um where am I now two of everything that is true yes thou shall of every clean yes thou shall take to thee by seven the male and the face and of this that are not clean [Music] air the male and his 80 is it what is what it is saying yes or verse 3 or false also of the air by sevens leading that's it that is the Covenant it has to be by service the male and the female now listen to keep seed kill it the only way to keep it alive that will keep seed alive and that's how it is to keep seed s alive amen amen amen now after reading yeah let us Elder where you are just take a mic and I mean you say a prayer for the proceedings yes sir right dear heavenly father as we are following our hands your rate your weight has been read the word that you spoke in the beginning the original seat God we have read from the holy scriptures we are asking about thee in the last days as you put in the heart of our pasta to talk about this great subject of the rainbow Covenant a covenant that you make with your children here is the word the Bible that was written by different men Lord for anticipation but they were led by the Holy Spirit they were led by you you chose them and elected them and equipped them to write this Hollywood even today this morning we come to you that the spirit that road the Bible off Amen to being dismissed in our mist there is our pastor that you have used so many years going all around the world father Lord we saw you mightily performing your way a word that you spoke in the beginning was so creative amen when you said let there be light there was light every time lord when light comes in darkness depart yes Father this morning we commit ourselves our bodies our spirit our souls as Living Sacrifice as the pastor is going to teach us about what you have placed in his heart Lord we believe that this is direct from you Lord it can create something in us that we can know that we are the Covenant people yes you have left us a seed and you said if you did not leave a seed for us amen will be like Sodoma and Gomorrah but because you have left this seat your children Lord your bride that you chose and wrote their names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world let this word Lord go direct to our hearts bless him literally Lord and this place we have Commit everything under your control in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated God bless you all right um now yesterday the scripture keeping the seed alive amen amen then we will just read a a few things here they're not willing and [Music] now that's why we have seventure changes [Music] amen amen that's why we are alive [Music] you know yeah I think it's as I have said already three days back I was you know before three days before we went on a busborough I was reading something and I I put on the what's name I I wanted to hear to listen to a song a special song hey you know my my song Lord Jesus come foreign now I was I was I was having a view of you or less you are seated like this [Applause] and you know you you look to me like a Eternal business [Applause] we are really here not to support Brothers now before God can do anything with you he has to establish a covenant now worship God if it is he is just to us just a god it is the carbon the cabinet and that keeps yes it is you don't have the choice of yourself they don't train things so the children of Israel they could be in Egypt but they could not drain anything because they were under a coverage if they suffer they suffer still alive [Applause] so everything they've done God said about them I will establish a covenant binds God to take you over the red seats that that binds God and yeah that's why he will say he comes to you accordingly not because [Music] forever no not our efforts amen because he says alive amen yeah now I I I have one part here which we read something my books are old you know foreign let me check again yeah Hebrews 2 23 25. this Hebrews 3 25. Hebrews 3 25. we have read it uh is it three yes 325 it should be yeah man [Music] three I say I will repeat 3 25 325 I don't know whether you've got the right part years let me look at it properly amen or a let's try 3 3 11 3 11. okay no brother this is a very serious subject is I looked into it time and again to say I'm under a covenant by grace somebody's going to is Page Three some let me come to it and I I was looking at 325 it will it is supposed to be three page three something here let me remind you so that you will know the page the prophet says that's 325. 33 25 . in this old book of mines but you will know a new version of the book of Hebrews where it is in this one is 325 page 325 paragraph 211 and it's Christ we are repeating it's Christ that God looks at not you question is yeah and then it's Christ so if those no fault in him how can they be formed how can he find fault when you are dead and your life is hid in Christ [Music] cannot find the fold in himself and shall I repeat that [Music] amen it's not a human makeup maybe saying we have prayed we have fasted known no it doesn't come to terms with the Covenant our highest it's not what you have done it speaks of what he has done [Applause] amen amen that's why you see the devil wants to do this this we we just keep quiet and we will answer at the right time I don't [Music] know because the Bible says love your enemies that is the Bible now a man will say even if he does this and he has done this this to me no a person under a covenant who doesn't care whether you have done this the Bible says love even your enemies [Applause] because God is love amen amen if somebody does something against you because if you hate Patrol the Bible says you are like like okay if if you hate terrible things [Music] amen amen amen it keeps you offline you know you'll find somebody singing should somebody doesn't love up here even so yeah yeah [Applause] [Applause] the right foreign amen amen okay even now I remember there's so many people I met a brother said brother with Aaron it's just a type yeah he was talking with some other brothers okay then immediately after that [Music] there was a wedding daughters okay now I loved him more than ever amen amen because I said I I know he can't say that it is now he was coming from the opposite directions and then so I look at him he was trying to go that way I said hello brother I am calling for his attention [Music] [Music] amen how are you man yeah I said my brother now let's look at this keeping the seed who pretty shall pay life amen there must be God's system for keeping the city a life don't mean breathing life is in him he is our Christ Our Life no not breathing no that is not life that is for this body but in Christ our life amen amen now if Christ is your life that means okay uh let me attend to this book the I think is that's something that I was looking for I think that's what you watch that is 380 because this book okay no we'll come to to that I don't know whether it's referring to this one yeah it's Christ that God looks at it not you sing when which book is this okay it could be just read it from this one and it's Christ that looks at not you amen amen in this one is Page 325 another version yeah they correspond is the same thing you see the brother is in the uh and they're not asleep amen and it's Christ that God looks at it I mean we are coming to that it's Christ so if there is no fault in him how can they be full how can he find fault when you are dead [Music] Israel is that the thing and your life is hit in Christ through God sealed by the Holy Ghost they that are born of God does not commitment amen born of God for you cannot sing the Bible says that is born of God cannot God like father if you are born of an African Africa you can claim yourself the way you want but you are an African now that's why in in Christ you don't come and say I quit this I quit that ready you are born [Music] because a person can quit cigarettes what is cigarettes when you were born when you were born you are not smoking when you were born you were not drinking is that right amen now that is what happened if when we started drinking and smoking and the Covenant still you're not served and say yes my son my daughter you were not born to drink amen amen the new best yeah it changes your nature is not you saying you know I'm just keeping myself that's not Christianity you sleep amen daughters we love those who hate us we pray for our enemies amen have you ever heard me saying people are saying this retaliated foreign [Music] leave it in the hands of God like like our master they will Judah says against him amen amen he never panicked because this is what he came from and they are nature was against his Nation because his nature is divine amen amen with divine nature even his enemies it says love your enemies don't wish him bad things that is not Christianity I mean ah man you tell somebody love your enemies even if he does this and this is this no it's not to you it's to Christy it's against Christ that is in you against you in particular letter let us be Christians let us be Christians amen but we will be Christians amen because if it is by Covenant you become christ-like and finally Christ you are not keeping yourself it's not you all about the endurance is you are under a covenant amen he said I will fight for you if somebody has promised to fight for you and he says trying to fight for yourself he will keep away from you but if if you are under a covenant the children of Israel Israel in Egypt foreign [Music] foreign nothing that can find God to do anything [Music] you fall under the Covenant and then so it keeps you alive Covenant of seven you are kept alive what is kept alive [Music] because that seed will again be seen in the New Jerusalem you can kill it it will grow again that is seeds you need to become seeds then you will close right now under a cabinet and yeah thank God for my brother they always help me send me a quotation from the other side from the other side it's from here because they are with us here and let me read it yeah and it's Christ that God looks at Allah you you you understand what you what it says God looks at Christ he must see you increase children [Music] and the father come on say it I am and threefolds everywhere now yeah you see what it means right now I read I don't know what makes me to repeat again it's Christ that God looks at Christ it doesn't say Jesus Jesus is we have a book here book of Christ is the mystery of God Revenge [Music] that book Wherever I Go foreign [Applause] Christian Christ I'm when you just come he will tell us all things no jolly as the prophet says now this woman she was waiting for that word [Music] flesh when the weight was made flesh then she said to the people come and see when the people arrived he said come and see you know that's a that was a great Revolution she knew that this Christ when he comes it will be in the form of America now he says come and see amen everyone moved when they will come around is this not the crisis is going Beyond now foreign it and through God he says he finds I'm still there he find fault when how can he find foreign foreign [Music] [Music] all right but then what happens you come to the seventh Church age will reach okay how can he find food yeah when you are dead and your life is hit in Christ Christ is the anointing amen amen and do you know the the Genesis anointing where's my book again okay never mind I mean yeah in the book Cod you look at God logos logos out of logos logos came forth men men out of logos so now usually we we look at it right now here how where are you from foreign [Music] a person under a covenant knows when you are a Christian or you are a believer just a believer because the way to be a Christian is to be Christ alike Christ was not Christ because he stopped smoking I mean no foreign [Music] [Music] um how do you how can you live in the love of the things of the world not drinking you just become a good citizen now Christianity is to be christed oh you are not drinking it's just your habits but when now the Covenant when God remembers his Covenant comes to you and they went to Egypt because they displeased to God but yet felt the Covenant God kept the Covenant [Music] just like the Jews we can still Maybe [Music] to them foreign he says he will remember his children amen and he will take them out of the tribulation all right amen we were sinners oh yeah that's the difference amen [Music] all right we shall I finish now shall I finish okay now the seed is kept alive is under what under a covenant kept alive when they are in Egypt he says I remember we never said I remember their sins no my foreign [Music] I mean how can he find food when by the Holy Ghost sealed by the Holy Ghost they that are born of God you know born and they that upon of God does not commit sins for he cannot sin is [Music] how can he sin now when a perfect sacrifice is laying in his place God never looks at me [Music] he looks at Christ because we are in Christ amen the only way you can see the Seven Seas that's when you are part of the free phone [Music] otherwise it is not revealed I see you to you who are not in the [Music] in the day you shall know that I am okay and come on ends up with me I in you amen amen amen he's not asking me to uh get him in me um thank you understand the Covenant he doesn't ask anything from you he says I have done it already it's finished that's why on the cross he said amen amen yes I have shed my blood for them it's finished amen [Music] no more any other sacrifice can he sin when a perfect sacrifice is lying in his place let me end with this amen he says God looks not not at me you know it behooves me to be right in him [Music] so that when he looks he will look at Christ not me amen [Music] amen but if he looks at the sacrifice then he shall not judge me because they sacrifice has has covered me under a covenant so he can't look at me he looks at the secrets amen when they came with thoughts talking about him day and night then when they they arrived leave them take me amen I am their sacrifice [Applause] I have remembered my Covenant let them go and Peter was running and he said let them alone take me take the sacrifice foreign and now I'm let me read this party we we we we we look at it how how merciful is God amen that's why we serve him with our honest heart we don't fear him because he's terrible of his Holiness we bow before him we quit all things to serve in order all right amen amen let's look you know as I was reading then I sometimes when reading yeah even so come Lord Jesus Christ some people hate it they don't they are not expecting him if we had that power to pull him down we would have done that already happened but fella we are saying even so come and take yours okay we are learning to go Arena what are we here for you we have done his will amen amen and then what we came for we are trying to fulfill his his will amen amen like that Soldier we have done what we were sent to do because they will be shouting Dancing in Heaven he says if you don't love noise don't go to heaven me also I thought that heaven is a place where you enter with a candle like even when coaching somebody but there's no question don't take tables with you this is now I thought that some people think having to be like that and there's something that yeah they are doing their own things like maybe if you are a child of a pastor you just carry on drinking smoking that the day you'll grab the pasta go ahead and then when he arrived foreign [Music] foreign [Music] are you watching what is happening we are watching and we know because he told us about this thing we see the times amen and I don't know what to expect more than what we have seen already foreign [Music] [Music] and he is [Music] yeah we are going somewhere Beyond The Blues for me [Music] to be I see my savior's face [Music] [Music] amen amen foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] yes yes thank you amen okay I thank God we do not worship in vain we are worshiping him as Citizens for the Bible says we are the citizens and now there was there's a migration of the children of Abraham will come to that the migration of the children of Abraham and when he was looking for a city the prophet saying thank God for Malachi thank God for the seventh angel messenger Abraham Abraham arrived at a literal place where the city will come and he met melchized foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] they will arrive in the city 144 150 000 being the eunuchs all right let's finish here let's read this last part keeping the seed who are alive and now I will read this part by seven sevens but this others because they've got their own cleanse they've got their own systems that's why it's by two but those who fall under the Covenant should be by seven [Applause] to keep the seed our life because these ones are under a covenant so it can't be by two but by seven [Music] keep the seed alive now in closing let me stop this in closing because anyhow we are closing weather in closing or not including but we are closing a rainbow Covenant for God to be your God who has to establish a covenant with you [Music] if you are not under his Covenant he is to you but if you are under a covenant that's the difference amen a man who just worshiped and the men who worship is two different things that's why he says he that is born no no not he that quit smoking but he that is because the the God he gets God you remember that better fighting against the prophet of God when I read the part that the sons of God the spirit from the other side he was opposing [Applause] these people talking about the underworld amen coming from PE from everyone and I'm going to read it now if somebody wants to fight he should fight the prophet [Applause] not me no I'm just a child and God has sent me Elijah the prophet [Applause] if you hear me saying underworld that's after my prophet underwater now if you wanna fight you'll fight him I'm coming with that we we're going to look into it chapter 8 chapter 8 John more you are from beneath and I am from above foreign Mike brother I know that you are okay yeah I know that um so he says he did not he doesn't deny it uh I know that you are Abraham's seed and listen I know that yeah Abraham said but easy to kill me because my weight has no place in you [Music] the thing that that hate you have hatred in you it is because my way [Music] Come Away if the weight is not in you start you fight against the weight carry one brother I speak that which I have seen with my father and ye do that which he have seen with your father hey two fathers one is from his father and they are from their father okay they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus said unto them if you were Abraham's children you will do the works of Abram but now he's seek to kill me a man that have told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham he do the Deeds of your father then said they to him we be born we be not born of fornication we have one father even God Jesus said unto them if God were your father he will love me for I proceedeth forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me I'm still looking for you came verse 23 yeah and he said unto them ye are from beneath I am from above right if I want to use another word for beneath I will say you are from even if I don't say underworld I can say you are from under um no Jesus says that's why we are at loggerheads are from under I am from now those from beneath and from above they don't share ideas they don't meet because the word of God is not coming from under it is from Benin it is from above that's the difference a person from beneath he will confront the one coming from above that's why he said I'm from my father you are from your father so two different fathers that's why we don't agree because I am from my father and you are from your father if yeah if you could list if they could listen to this Jesus from heaven he is God make flesh and dwelt Among Us to make friends with his seeds let me quickly run this area right and you finish now um I'm I'm reading nine you know read where I'm going okay and and God spoke unto Noah and to his sons with him say you know you know if if you are under a covenant you are blessed if your children are also under but it is in all in God's plan the parents go this way foreign going that way [Music] now I've got as I'm saying we are going to stand for him then if if you are trying to say there is no underworld we are going to prove okay not what we know but what we have received from their seventh angel messenger [Music] and it is from the Bible even here it says to me it's enough I'm from and you are from [Music] I want to see next time when they will rejoice over the world beneath sounds better [Music] don't say understand so we don't care if you say we are from beneath but we don't want you to use the word all right oh Hallelujah and investment and I behold and end is it I I behold I establish my Covenant with you and with your seed after you yeah [Music] [Music] now if he says to me I established Covenant with you and you'll see it and a child comes and says one foreign [Music] yes a child of Abraham Abraham would go around saying we will see many people getting into a dispute we get a pasta right then Hayward um foreign you should know when it says seed the Seed of Abraham amen not a a lecturers and 10 and with a covenant I will establish my Covenant now my his company yeah
