Description:
This message was preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 19 February 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle in South Africa

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the Kinsman redeemer.  The Pastor read Revelation 5:1-7 “And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which the seven Spirits of God are sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.”
‭
During the sermon the Pastor indicated that we are kin to the Kinsman’s redeemer. 
He further informed the Church that our Redeemer is a family man, and His blood saves those who are his family. If you are redeemed it means you are kin to the Kinsman redeemer.

The Kinsman’s relatives are coming together.
The people that are in the constellation they have only one word, faith, they are one, it is a family.

how are you there where is this brother foreign okay all right I believe he's coming thank you brother amen the first time he came yeah you know there were some people who didn't understand others even they had a spirit for trying to stop him from speaking when I arrived from Tanzania then I was told and I knew why well you know I was I picked up these few pages about him about him and by him and after reading I forwarded it to brother Victor and so he took him it put him on a higher plane yeah yeah this part from the brother because I'm trying to for a few minutes I'm trying to talk about will come here today King's Men Redeemer yeah Kings what what does that mean kids or Kingsman era look amen right amen relative close relative a relative yeah I mean now Kingsman Redeemer um okay and I understand when he say John looked for a human Kingsman um okay um I'm in man you know take it easy yeah that's like a supernatural topic now did you know that John Luke for a human Kingsman [Music] house amen amen then I realized that yeah I was Redeemed by the blood of a king's men amen house is then I realized when I I receive these messages from the King's Men amen I see you you hear even this morning we are still receiving from the Kings May the king's is foreign let us first identify ourselves amen amen then I I realized the message is that we preach and have preached easy bringing together the keys foreign because it's from the king's main Redeemer Ultra moon now all the family members are connecting amen because it's one of the family members amen who died in order because I was I I remember last time it was the same brother a gay person yeah when I was struggling a bit to find my speaking about blood tests blood test and then because he was in the service he quickly sent me the message she remind me of the page you know because he is to me a king's name so now I I'm trying to read something here [Applause] that's why when we we really go deeper into the Family Matters the people are not going to understand us [Applause] because it's only the people of the bloodline who will grasp the things that we are going through talk about all right amen and now I I quickly adjusted to myself to to this oh we were Redeemed by a king's men go Amen to bring back the key Kings folk who wishes [Music] to redeem them amen yes sir and it hasn't yet find a place in you is amen amen foreign [Applause] why I'm asking about this brother one of what I've got from him says they call me brother life brother life is brother Pele kasady okay okay because of the life we have my soul is alive and then so I remember in 2012 when I came here for the first time and down the line here he says and I met my equal Israel really do you know that brother they call Israel yes when he was talking I was sitting right there in the corner I looked at him okay amen now among them people the audience that day we are more uh they didn't realize there was a a king's men who has come to visit the King's Men yes then he says I I met my equal I don't know if the spirit has started to stand against or whatever and I met my equals now Joel if I weigh you hey I would say he's talking with me about me amen amen instead of saying he's talking about uh brother we called Israel once you are talking to one member you are talking to all them because it is a via bloodline is all right amen now that's why we recognize one another whether you are a million of kilometers away from here but they will still we will still fit in touch [Music] when do we get in touch when a Kingsman Maybe a million kilometers away foreign all right amen and the best news of the day yeah is to hear from your King's Men that will be the best the best news today uh this to me is a king's men talking to me not to the other person is if you can find two people talking about and they are family members you end up saying let me excuse you a bit while you are talking because the the communications you don't belong to the family family that's why when the family people come together sometimes they will say can you please add us excuse us we just want to come together uh the other people are not part of it they won't even understand it you must know that there are things a family would come together and have a meeting and the other person will never understand how about you I mean I mean now that's why at this end time ministry has opened up a conversation between the family members that's why he says no one will know about it that's the King's Men really the King's Men Redeemer we're coming to talk to the family members he says no one will will know it all right amen and um foreign he was looking for a uh something for their car we went to I think is Pretoria North I went with him now we arrive at a place where uh there's a notice body there notice Baltimore and uh it says here no no trust no uh no entry oh no entry say it no entry Beyond this point you still remember it no entry Beyond this foreign [Music] why it says no entry foreign amen amen so if it is not revealed to that one the family man it is amen look that's why the Bible says [Music] the Seed of Abraham is okay question that's right amen so jolly if if you are you are looking at that it is talking about the seeds the Seed of Abraham is Christ trusted and Christ himself he chose not he took not the form of the Angels the Bible says amen yeah yeah because he's a family man Abraham not sending a letter but he came to Abraham and Abraham recognized family yeah all right amen so now I I realized when I read earlings about these brothers you know um I don't have a father here or sister but I'm a family man fella okay I have brothers and their sisters one is greeting this morning and so for this our our brothers amen [Applause] the bloodline but not human bloodlines now it makes us Brothers and that's why this brother he says I'll take one part um I hope I'm not killing somebody um when I came here they were not those pictures now today when I came hey and and I looked there I called him yeah he went I called him oh he went out the back after the service camera service and I told you what are you supposed to tell him okay amen I will put this I'm going to say something here this one brother my sister was with me was here yeah my brother and he says I'm just taking something there and then you know our reach yeah yeah this part I I didn't come to greet the church I came to greet the bride you hear that we are not talking about the church we are talking about the price is that right we have so many churches but we have the bride of Christ all right amen brother brilliam decided this or decided to come as an American but he's not an American we decided to become African Africa we have decided now let me read it here now maybe you are saying he's not reading the Bible okay no this family here if you read about what they uh have written uh or what they are talking about like that part we have read that the summer written women did not say it continue from here when she said that's nothing but the truth she didn't say it from here God spoke out of him yeah I'll tell you Peter Pedro he said who do men say that I the son of man they said some say you are Jeremiah and what did he say and then who do you say that Lena I the son of man now that was another class well you so if Elizabeth now there's classes something is Jeremiah some is saying the spiritual classes who do you say that I the son of man I am and Peter says foreign and Jesus said Peter Pedro Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this it can come from another man but my father so he didn't say it from here when he said now that's why now we are we are we want to hear the message that is not from here amen because if it is from here somebody will say something that he has heard somebody talking about amen but we we are expecting to hear not from here you know there are seven seas don't bring a message amen that's right now Peter says the Christ amen he was not reading out of a certain Paper Maybe amen and that's why Christ said blessed you didn't say it at one time she said come and see continue amen amen much then they came to see this woman things they didn't expect that another human being could tell another humans don't expect to hear all things from a man amen that's why we said God said tell the children of Israel to Moses I spoke with you from Heaven it's not from here it's from there foreign foreign amen okay ah man now this woman says foreign [Music] she was waiting for that way foreign so that when they met foreign live streaming live stream live streaming you know it reminds me of that cloud and was published by which newspaper newspaper everything Life Magazine live magazine you see how it is live streaming okay amen yeah you are saying many things now live streaming live streaming now usually it benefits those that are those that have life finally amen okay that's why he says life life it will benefit the one who has permanently life liberty what I'm saying is because of this life streaming able to connect the phone [Applause] from Alabama from Alabama from elsewhere through the life is okay amen because there are seven seals should be live streaming okay live streaming which reconnects and you come to the servant series doesn't say anything but yet fella it is saying something foreign now usually who would say yes you see he was trying to introduce he wanted to know if I bring these people together to him he wanted to see who would say is because she has realized foreign yeah foreign again because these things are in this way let me find that if I can find it amen after he has said that yeah he says it will be revealed foreign just about his appearance all right amen now we are going to pick that up yeah okay amen of the time yeah of his appearance what will happen at that time he says I was trying to get it from the books um I don't have it here with me again but but I do have it I mean part of it is he omitted the revelation of this seventh Seer yeah and when the seventh seal when all right let me bear with me when he opened it out also omitted it again so we see uh we see that that is a complete mystery therefore surely there are one now is not yet for this mystery Africa foreign when did he he say this um yes now I'm reading to you in this yes okay amen now he has said this yes that is a complete mystery recipe therefore the hour is not yet for this mystery to be known we uh all right the hour is not yet for this mystery therefore we are this Farm

brothers coming the bright is coming together coming together and then it will be new yeah around about the time we are we are not go and this is the time that Jesus he's not talking about we are appearing for everybody foreign so we're not surprised amen the people of this time they say no no he said it will be revealed amen no that's why now we can see the who's the bride [Applause] that's
