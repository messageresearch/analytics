[41:44] I want to take the seventh seal now the
[41:48] seven cheese edges
[41:50] so it's bridge on the 12 5 54.
[41:55] we shall live in the paragraph for 21st
[41:58] up to 24. just two or ah
[42:03] to attach your mind in what we are here
[42:06] for amen
[42:08] the prophet says he said now in this
[42:13] it's to my humble believer that we are
[42:17] living in the closing days of the world
[42:22] history
[42:24] I want to make that real clear
[42:27] you see it was a prophecy you want to
[42:29] make it clear
[42:31] that we are living in the closing of the
[42:37] history of
[42:38] living a Godly life according to the
[42:41] message that he will give you life
[42:44] today we are seeing Christianity it has
[42:48] so much challenges
[42:57] they are living
[42:59] like a there's no promise of the coming
[43:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:05] people are living the way it pleases
[43:08] them
[43:09] at the end they say that a believer of
[43:12] entire message
[43:14] at the end they are saying that they are
[43:17] Christians
[43:18] but what they are reflecting is
[43:20] something else
[43:23] Hallelujah
[43:25] oh the prophet Kevin said he said and
[43:28] every Kingdom
[43:38] my hope is built on nothing else
[43:42] than Jesus blood and the righteousness
[43:45] All Around My Soul give away
[43:48] he is All My Hope and staying on
[43:52] Christ's the solid rock as 10
[43:56] all other ground is seeking sin amen
[44:00] [Music]
[44:02] the only place
[44:05] the only safe place is in Christ
[44:09] Hallelujah the only safe places so all
[44:15] of us we need to be sure that we are in
[44:17] there
[44:20] oh Jesus let me read one quotation and
[44:24] our pastor will come Hallelujah
[44:28] in the preaching they called out that is
[44:31] even our title when there is trouble in
[44:35] the world
[44:35] when people are getting distracted God
[44:38] is peace calling is all
[44:40] Hallelujah
[44:41] God is calling his own Hallelujah
[44:46] so the prophet says it's preached on the
[44:49] 9th January
[44:52] 28th paragraph 10 but I will read and
[44:56] down there
[44:57] see it seems to me
[44:59] [Music]
[45:04] feeling this great pressure coming on
[45:10] should go to safety
[45:13] everything is complete nothing works
[45:16] life is so expensive
[45:19] this and that but we need to go to the
[45:23] safety Place amen
[45:27] when nothing was working in Egypt
[45:31] Israel had a safety please
[45:35] Hallelujah
[45:37] oh thanks God
[45:42] they don't do it
[45:44] did what did want to listen
[45:48] though the warning voice of God speaks
[45:52] it day after day
[45:54] night after night but men desires to
[45:59] live in sin
[46:03] people are getting used with the end
[46:05] timer message
[46:09] and that message is not a Pentecostal
[46:12] Church
[46:14] this is not a Pentecostal Church
[46:17] well
[46:18] [Music]
[46:19] and the message is something above
[46:23] everything that we can find in the world
[46:27] a message that is
[46:30] a message that is perfecting the bride
[46:33] of Christ
[46:35] a message that making us to be ready for
[46:39] the tea coming day
[46:41] amen
[46:44] the prophet said people will hear the
[46:45] warning but they won't
[46:48] [Music]
[46:50] when people they don't listen
[46:52] now we are going but the stubborn seed
[46:57] they start stubbornness until they face
[47:00] the first one that was kind
[47:03] when God told him hey sin is laying at
[47:06] your door
[47:07] do height and I will be with you
[47:11] God give him the advice to do
[47:14] [Music]
[47:16] but he never listened because he was not
[47:18] the seed of
[47:20] hallelujah oh thanks God
[47:30] [Music]
[47:34] that's why we need to be awake to know
[47:39] who we are say you know it's later
[47:44] than we think
[47:46] people think that they got plenty of
[47:49] time
[47:50] but the scripture declared it's later
[47:53] than we think
[47:55] Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah
[48:01] and the days of Lord
[48:04] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[48:08] of God
[48:11] amen
[48:12] that prophecy we have seen it fulfilled
[48:17] what was happening in the time of Noah
[48:20] what was happening in the time of Sodom
[48:22] and come we saw it happening
[48:24] [Music]
[48:26] but people
[48:28] they are still sleeping
[48:30] they think that we've got plenty times
[48:33] no there's no more time it's later then
[48:36] we think
[48:39] amen
[48:40] it's a calling to Awakening

[48:46] if you are not yet ready
[48:48] led to this time make you to be ready

[1:06:38] their attributes will do the same thing
[1:06:43] just like what Abraham did
[1:06:47] he met a man
[1:06:49] but Abraham knew that the man was
[1:06:52] Melchizedek
[1:06:55] because he could see beyond the curtain
[1:06:57] of time
[1:07:01] and now the prophet says it will happen
[1:07:04] again

[1:34:33] the lamb
[1:34:34] um

[1:34:55] there
[1:34:56] now
[1:35:03] the right who sat on the throne
[1:35:06] law obviously where was the throne

[1:35:31] uh the Lord Jesus when he was asked
[1:35:34] where is your father
[1:35:36] he would say the father is in me

[1:35:50] not the first person not the second
[1:35:52] person
[1:35:55] the father was in him
[1:35:59] he was in him
[1:36:02] so he took the book from within himself
[1:36:16] so he took the book
[1:36:19] within himself
[1:36:23] and he was the only one who could do
[1:36:26] that
[1:36:27] was in him
[1:36:32] and he took it from the right hand of

[1:46:39] Manchester
[1:46:43] the unveiling of God
[1:46:46] preach 11
[1:46:48] and paragraph 68. notice
[1:46:56] okay the first as the prophet yes
[1:47:03] his own crucified him
[1:47:06] he came as the son of man
[1:47:11] to write not the Son of God
[1:47:15] then after the Holy Spirit came number
[1:47:19] one amen
[1:47:21] of God
[1:47:26] he came as the son of man who is
[1:47:36] the holy spirit
[1:47:44] because God is a spirit
[1:47:50] because the seven churches
[1:47:54] were made by the spirit
[1:47:58] oh yeah it is in the book you're saying
[1:48:00] what the blasphemia's name Blasphemous
[1:48:03] names
[1:48:04] serve the holy ghosts
[1:48:09] that's why it says
[1:48:15] what the spirit says to the church
[1:48:20] but now we are no longer in the church
[1:48:22] age
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:33] is the age as I have read this year
[1:48:41] was that book again my brother the age
[1:48:44] this age that we are living in is
[1:48:55] okay then it says and the son of man
[1:49:00] himself in the same power that he was
[1:49:07] it through justification
[1:49:10] sanctification and all these things
[1:49:21] the Son of God the spirit so the church
[1:49:26] ages
[1:49:29] came through the Holy Spirit
[1:49:36] says
[1:49:40] beyond that is the son of man

[1:51:33] we've got this part also yet
[1:51:36] paragraph 73 paragraphs I read this part
[1:51:41] here
[1:51:42] and it says now eating uh
[1:51:48] and what does he do now
[1:51:53] returned as the son of man
[1:51:58] when he was crucified he was the son of
[1:52:02] foreign
[1:52:11] he became the son of
[1:52:14] God
[1:52:17] throughout the church ages
[1:52:22] but now
[1:52:24] after the seven churches
[1:52:27] [Music]
[1:52:29] we are after the church age
[1:52:38] [Applause]

[1:52:54] [Applause]
[1:53:02] to Rebecca one letter is but when
[1:53:06] Rebecca could see Isaacs Isaac
[1:53:21] was led
[1:53:23] Rebecca
[1:53:25] until Rebecca could see Isaac Rebecca
[1:53:30] Isaac amen amen
[1:53:34] so the prophet will lead the people
[1:53:38] until uh but when the time arrives
[1:53:45] in your book
[1:53:47] and what is the original seat then he
[1:53:51] says what now here is the secret
[1:53:56] is
[1:54:01] now here's he he brought the weight like
[1:54:05] eliasa to the bride who later is we now
[1:54:12] couldn't believe
[1:54:14] until
[1:54:31] she she could now see Isaac
[1:54:38] all right he took him right exactly at
[1:54:43] the right time
[1:54:46] when the seals open actually
[1:54:51] he said let us go and pass what is
[1:54:56] time
[1:54:59] the seals are open now
[1:55:02] you can go up past
[1:55:06] the weight is now in the price
[1:55:11] now if the word is in Rebecca um

[1:55:36] we are now with 10 as son of man
[1:55:41] the Seven Seas see seven seeds yes we
[1:55:45] tend to us
[1:55:51] and then from that son of David

[1:56:02] Son of God he he is revealed in the last
[1:56:07] days
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:15] not the son of
[1:56:17] a hand of God because the Son of God is
[1:56:22] the spirit
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:26] the son of God
[1:56:29] is the spirit
[1:56:31] and what is the son of man
[1:56:39] so the son of man the son of God
[1:56:47] this
