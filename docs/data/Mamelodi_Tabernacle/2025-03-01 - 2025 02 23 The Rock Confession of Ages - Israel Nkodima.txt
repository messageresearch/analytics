Description:
Title: The Rock Confession of Ages.
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 
23-02-2025 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Genesis 18: 9 - 11 | Genesis 2:8

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the confession of a rock in all ages.

It ceased to be with Sarah according to the manner of women, and at the end time it ceased to be with the bride after the manner of churches. No man can know or understand the seventh seal unless he is where the seventh seal is.

The people at the barrier line would say the seventh seal is not revealed, but the sons come and say it is revealed.

In the house of Abraham things were special. The third pull was in there. He also said shall I hide from Abraham the thing I do. If it is not revealed to you, find out from the house of Abraham.

To bring a complete ministry east and west must come together.

Every age must come with a rock confession
Before we start anything we must find a solid foundation.

The Pastor quoted the following spoken words:

63-0324E The Seventh Seal Par 404, 393
62-1104M Blasphemous Names Par 119
57-0818 Time Tested Memorials of God Par 106

usual use his voice Let's Hear You Lord through his voice speaking to us because you have said that the time will come when while you are still talking those who have come here with different diseases demons possessed when you talk those demons will run away you said this is the time and we believe it that this is the time talk Lord let Demons Run Away we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen uh shall we turn to uhis verse 11 verse 11 to 12 now uh uh uh uh or just read verse 11 for now Genesis 18:1 now Abraham and Sarah were old and well strien in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women amen amen and uh where where do we start verse 10 verse 10 and um let's say verse 9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife who has the husband here Abraham abrah yes our father in faith the children of Abraham and he said behold in the tent and and he said who's this now I will return unto thee according to the time of life and loah thy wife shall have a son so an announcement of his son was given by the Lord himself sah wife shall have a son and Sarah had it in the 10 door which was behind him behind now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in [Music] age and it seed to be with Sarah after the man of [Music] women you may be seated just the same as today uh to the bride of Christ the man of women now here it was the bread of Abraham now this one is the bride of Christ uh whom we will address a bit for some few minutes and uh in this uh last Earthly [Music] moments now in this time I read here in the book of who the book who is this meis sedc who is this meis now you realize he didn't say who was that now now to the bride is who is [Music] this all right amen then if if you were there we we look at the scripture a quotation that said and he came as a prophet MC came as a prophet then brother Bim said something in me met [Music] him okay amen something in the prophet met then he said have you met MC and me as a brother I said yes something in me met amen amen something in me now he didn't said I met mil something in me all right now if the husband If Abraham met then what about his wife all right amen now I I'm going to have some a very short time all right amen and we still come we are still coming with that white stone but what we are working on now is the white stone but in the pyramid so I was talking to a brother that we should first show what is a pyramid because the people know it as just a structure but they really don't know then time and again we quote pyramid pyramid the prophet was talking about the pyramid the pyramid but I will read you something here but today we are not on that I knew that we will I will have a short time so now but we are we have that on the what is what is a pyramid then but I will read one part of something here and Sarah now it ceased to be with Sarah after the man of women it ceased to be with the bride at the end time after the men of churches the manner of women of churches okay amen now I I'm looking in this book here I was reading something here uh page 570 5 5 Seven Seals you'll forgive me my books are all I read on the inside we'll still continue we want to come to the pyramid what is a pyramid because you will realize that at the end of it all H the prophet said something that closed the rest of the ministry and put it in one thing Hallelujah all right amen and then he says yeah he spoke of the dream of Junior jaon but the part that I'm referring to is this one on the inside of that pyramid now now if I say to you on the inside of this pyramid you'll remain asking what is the pyamid which pyamid you remain asking just like the people they walking around still wondering what is the seventh and then as we will continue even after this then you will see where the seventh seal is and no one can understand it or know about it unless he is where the seventh seal is amen amen amen amen I'm sure show you something here one part where it says uh page 574 seven yeah six seal has being open to us we see it do you see it what is the six [Music] right Moses and Elijah that is the six they opened that they opened the six we have read that and but we knew that we know that this seventh seal cannot be according to this language broke to the public at that time he said until that hour the six has been opened to us but the servant it's not to the public all right now let's look at this for a few minutes listen I I I I I read here uh The Sixth Seal has been opened to us we see it no problem who's that who are they Moses and Elijah we see it then he comes and uh now the seventh seal is not to be known to the public it didn't say it is not to be known full stop not two there you know the public amen I said one time I was with a brother fromand um we were somewhere in Petoria West he was looking for something for his car now we arve at the place uh there was there where there was a burial line and B there on the bo region uh no what was that no entry Beyond this part yeah no entry entry Beyond this barrier now while while we were taking note of that here comes a young man he just opened the gate went straight in so there was a man working on the garden there then we said why that one without looking around just comes and open and we've been standing here saying whether we should enter or not he said no this one that one is the son of the owner you know anyway we just kept quiet there son of the old now you come to B L and they will say the seven seal is not revealed but come son of the owner to announce it is revealed all right amen now listen here now that that the seven seal is not to be known listen to the now if you say it is not revealed you are because it's not revealed now if you are public you are part of that then you say to me it is but if you are a son you just come through amen amen praise God now there are things that H an ordinary man cannot see firstly let me return here and it ceased to be with Sarah after the man of churches after the manner of women how come that this special woman what makes her so special it is because it seized to be with her after that means they were maners of women but God dealt with this one in a special way she didn't need to come through the manner of women that's why she didn't Belong To The World Church it was something special in the house of Abraham God specializ in the house of Abraham things were special amen you know the thir pool was in the house of Abraham everything was special in the house of Abraham till today in the house of Abraham he said I shall shall I hide from abah if it is not revealed to you find out from the house of Abraham for the Lord said shall I hide Abraham would not say it is not reveal okay amen now we are going to run just for a few minutes now the seventh seal is not to be known to the public meaning that it is supposed to be known but not to the public now let's take it to the house of Abraham where the third pool resided in the house of Abraham not elsewhere am the of Abraham special one now today there's so many questions this is not revealed this here is something here uh it says let's see the interpretation here now that okay let's start the thir came you know of the angels that came from the West uh did you know that there was this Eastern West now Genesis chapter 2 tells you that God placed menen where the east of the Gard yeah am that's why he says no no let's read it where is it Genesis chapter 2 verse verse 8 yeah read there let let us see and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed Amen in that Garden East what not West that's why you hear the prophet speaking about East and West has met you you you remember h i will avoid reading some of this but we will come and continue but you remember the prophet said I went to connect with the angels message okay amen now because it says uh hey where is that scripture here what happened there we have east and west Adam where was Adam read it brother you know where is it Genesis chapter 2 amen yeah and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed where yeah so now then the prophet said I went West to connect with them Angel's message and he came back he came back East he went West and came back East with the Angel's message that East and [Applause] West okay amen that's where you find the the bride today [Music] East and West All Right amen now here I read this part there was brother Jackson's dream he's referring to you to this that the Lord let me interpret for him we will see this dream on the inside why the people don't know what is a pyramid which I've got it will come on the inside of the pyramid now everything that the the prophet would mention it should be known to the amen amen if the prophet speaks about the pyramid then the bright should know about [Applause] the Abraham is shall I hide let me read this and you'll understand that the Lord shall never hide anything unless it is not the bridge now on the inside of that pyramid [Music] on there was white stone you see where is your white where it was found the white stone on the inside of that pyramid nothing written on each that's the reason I had to go W to connect East and West men coming from the East to connect the Angels amen amen so that east and west where they came together now that's why where you find the thir pool seven SE that's where eastn West [Applause] met Junior Json on the inside of that pyramid yeah all right I'm closing listen now you say on the inside of that pyram you know what is a pyramid now if I say on the inside of the pyramid and then you say Amen Pastor what is a pyramid okay amen

there supposed to to bring a complete Ministry if you are born of God and uh you are counted with the Saints here in this eastn West Ministry amen amen you can't even sin because outside of that you won't find son okay yes I mean of God am that's the reason I had to go west to connect with this Angel's message you see now if the our ministry has stopped short of this place east and west amen amen if we come short of the meeting of east and west then we are still striving we are we are outside because inside that's where East and West meet amen is then you will see when we come to the pyramid

other grounds are sinking SS but this rock which is called Jesus Christ it's a great Revelation it's a great mystery and one day the prophet it has never reached the heart of a man to know what God has got in store for us and every day we come in this place father to hit at the spot of Eternity where father we hear our names the character of who you are throughout the seven Church ages coming in the opening of the seals we thank you Lord Jesus for giving us a Shepherd who always look after our souls father who every time he goes and feed us with the right food Lord a right stuff that has made us to be who we are today father as you have delivered this word may you seal it in our hearts father may we go out there and manifest what is in our hearts we cannot help it but just to say glory to God and say Amen so be it as we go out home Lord keep on meditating upon this word we can hear time and again many sisters and brothers are talking about that brother that sister there that brother

preached in this place now we have in that opening of the seventh seal father and they talk about the closing of the seven seal but it keeps on unfolding and it is that word rock with a rock confession every one of us we confess who we are where we come from and what you have done for us we have traveled throughout the seven Church ages and out of there father you have called all the more
