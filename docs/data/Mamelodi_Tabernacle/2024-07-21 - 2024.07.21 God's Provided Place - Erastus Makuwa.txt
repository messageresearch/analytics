Description:
Title: God's Provided Place
Text: The Secret Place
Preached by Pastor Erastus Makuwa at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 21 July 2024

Exodus 33: 18-23  | John 17: 5 | II Kings 6:15-16 | Isaiah 51:1

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about God's provided place and a secret place in the provided place.

A provided place is a rock. And within the provided place there is another place which is a secret place and that is a clift. But there you cannot come by yourself, God must bring you in there. We have three things that we can do ourselves, which are water baptism, taking communion and feet washing. To come to the place you can do it yourself. God said to Moses, come to the place by me. 

Abraham stood where he stood before the Lord and he saw Sodom burning. And he couldnt see it at any other place.

Once you have seen the message then you cannot see anything else. Even to worship you have to come to a certain place. You cannot just worship anywhere. If you are a true worshiper, you must look for a place of worship where God is.

Where God is, his family is there. Before you come to the service God sends his angels first. If you have a theophany, before you leave your home your theophany waits for you at your seat. There is a connection between you and the worship and where the word of God is you want to be there. If you find Him  you find his family. His family is where He is. 

Your life is a voice. And your life can call the people without you talking. When you come to the rock, you come to Christ. All that the father has given me will come and no man can come except my father draweth him. 

God Himself pulls you in the clift because you are part of that clift. You were hewned from the clift and you fit in that place. That is where you come from.

Moses saw the glory of God and that was the back part of a man. He was passing going to Jerusalem to be put in flesh. But at the end we hear the knock at the door. When someone knocks and you open you see the face....

the book of Exodus chapter 33 exod 33 we start from reading the verse 18 verse 18 to verse 23 verse 23 Exodus 33 ver 18 to 23 and he said I beseech thee show me thy glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will Proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy on whom I will show mercy and he said thou can not see my face for there shall no man see me and leave and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put thee in a cliff of of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen amen amen can you read also John chapter 17 verse 5 yes chapter 17 ver 5 John chapter John 17 ver5 and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world war let's close our eyes as we pray our dear heavenly father thank you for this privilege yes you privileged US today Amen to have a wonderful visitor The Visitor we longed for for a long time here I am today in

they yes sir when they go home they will be complaining about their hearts why our hearts did not burn within us while he was there speaking to us amen help us Lord amen we pray in the precious name of our Lord Savior Jesus Christ amen amen you may take your your seat H we are greeting our pastor Pastor today he's always with us he's with us even now he's with us in the service always he's with us even if we marriage with us and I really thank you for that um the scripture we have read here and I just want to take this small topic you always know I am not a l preacher uh uh topic says go provided place then it continues saying the secret place that is what I'm going to try to speak about it must be a place provided by God and there must be another place a secret place here where we have read uh Moses was asking God was requesting that he must show him his [Music] glory that is what Moses was asking from God to see the glory of God and we have read another scripture [Music] here that scripture says is Jesus talking yeah he said oh Father glorify thou me with with thy own self with the glory which I had with thee before the [Music] world he asking God to glorify him with his own self and his own self is the glory say that is the glory which we have to together before the world us glorify me father with that and it seems as if he something that Moses was looking for he wanted to see that that the glory I believe as we go on we shall also see that Glory but according to the scripture as we are reading but we shall come that um in verse 21 as we have read [Music] um God said answered Moses he said uh there is a place by me come and stand on that place amen but when we follow we found that that place it was a rock but the Bible says is a place by me and then he said to Moses when you are standing on that place now I'm going to do something I'm going to take you and put you inside the C of The [Music] Rock he said that is a secret place that's why I said I'm going to talk about a private provided place [Music] by God then according to the scripture that provided place was a rock then there is another place on the rock that is a CFT but there you don't go yourself God must take you and put you amen but what you must do because we have got three things that we can do ourselves is what baptism taking communion food watching those we can do ourselves that's why to come to the place you can do it yourself because God said to Moses come to the place by me the place provided by by me but when you are there then I will do something that's what the Bible says if you repent and you are baptized God will fill you he will forgive you your sins and he will fill you he will take over from there when you have done the [Music] F the first it must be you now sometimes to see to hear God you must come to a certain place just like Abraham he went to the place where he was with were standing before God then when he stood there to the same place he could see Sodom Ben he couldn't see Sodom Ben at place he had to go to the place where he stood before God when he stood there he saw S I say sometimes you must stand on a certain place to see and if you don't want to stand on that place you will never [Music] see but to see you must stand on that place let me read something here The Prophet says here he said how many ever seen that picture of a cow in the bush in the bush he said that you just have to look and look did you ever seen that or seen the picture of Christ in the bush or in the sky or clouds see that painter has got that so fixed up Sor that painter got that so fixed up until you have to look at it a certain way then when you once seen it you can't see nothing else but that it was a picture on a billboard on that billboard there was a bush and that on in that bush there was a picture of a cow there and people will pass there but not seeing that car but seeing the bush and see the billboard but to see that cow you must stand on a certain you must see you must look at a certain way you must stand on a certain place you can't just see it standing where you are standing you must come to a certain place and look a certain way but there must be someone who has already seen he must take you put you at that place and let you s stand like this and look now then you will see but if you just come I will see where is it they say in that billboard you'll see there and come back you say there's nothing there but to see you must go there and you must be led by somebody and stand on a provided place and you will see and the prophet says here once you have seen that once you have seen it you will see nothing else amen he says yeah everything else is G is God that is the way Christ is himself the gospel and the message is words in other words you say that is how that is the way Christ is that is where the message is that is where the gospel is and that is where the message of the hour is once you see the message of the hour there is nothing else you can see hallelujah amen are you listening once you have seen if you have seen that billboard if you have seen that car always when you look when you just say you see it amen but if you are not shown even if you can look like this you will see nothing once you have seen the message once you have seen it not saying I've seen but not seeing sorry yeah but once don't don't say I have seen when you have not actually seen anything there are people who will say I've seen the message they will say I inan the message but they are not there and they see nothing they're just they are just with us they're just accompanying us but once you have seen the message that's all everything is gone once you have seen the message you have seen the [Music] message when Noah and his group has seen the message nothing else mattered when when Moses saw it nothing else matter when job's group E nothing else matter when Jesus group so nothing else matters when the Apostle group saw it nothing else matters when Luther group so nothing else matter nothing else will matter nothing else will pull you away from it by for knowledge he pred these things to happen also to Worship You must have to come to a certain place the prophet also says like said like that to Worship You must come to a certain place you can't just worship anywhere if you want if you are a true worshiper you must look for a place of worship where God is and you you won't stop until you reach that place he says there is something about where you go what church you go to what teacher teaches you do you know that he got something to eat therefore we ought to seek out the very best that we can find so we are getting the best not because it is sociable so for but the real Bible teaching in other to you you are blessed people that is what the prophet is saying here because the prophet here is addressing you he says you so we are getting the best not because it is sociable or so forth but the real bible teach that is what we are getting here you can't get it anywhere it is something real you have to be sure about the place you go to worship because there is only one place where God can meet a worshiper at even wanted to go to that place where God always is there then he said if I can go to his house and knock at his door that is the wish of sh I think it is the wish it is your wish also he says here the thing I want to speak about this morning is that God has only one place that the worshiper can meet God only one place Through the Ages many has sought to has sought for that secret place of God through all ages that's why he said to Moses come to a place by me but now if you are there I will take to my secret you can't get there if you can just come my private my provided place then I will take you there he says through ages many has sought for that secret place of God through all ages even job wanted to know where he lived at if I could only go to his house and knock at his door job wanted to find gospel in place because God and his family is worshiped there the family of God in heaven and the family of God on Earth is named [Applause] Christ job wanted to find that place because where go is his family is [Applause] there he's always present where his family is the heaven heaven is always there where God is where his family is Heaven Is there that's what the prophet says before you come to this service before you come to this God sends his angels first there if you have got will come and wait for you it will wait for you at your seat and that's why if you are at home something is pulling you you want to come to church because something is waiting for you there there is a connection between you and with something there the word of God is part of you that's why where the word of God is you want to be there because you won't fit to any place because the word of God won't be there you will be where the word of God wanted to know where God lived at because if you find him you find his family and if you find this you find [Applause] him his family is where he is amen there is a place of worship and it is God's provided place of [Music] worship he could only meet you in that [Music] place but when we go back when we go back to where we were where we AF when we read verse 21 there the Lord said behold there is a place by me thou shall stand upon their is a is a provided place and we have said that is a roong and there was a secret place there and that secret place was the left of the Rock and the Bible says here you can't place yourself there he says when you have come to that place you'll see my glory because I will take you and put you in the C when I pass you see my in theft of the Rock in the secret place you don't get there yourself God had to pull you the Bible says so the prophet says so you can't go there yourself if you try people have tried but they failed some didn't try but they've managed to get there because it was God pulling them into [Music] that not themselves not their person people try to call people to come but because they are they are not called by God they won't come the prophet says you have got the voice you Al your Li is the voice and your voice your life can call people without you speaking leave the life first because some people by talking they drive people away Jesus said no man can come to me because the rock is Christ the Bible says the rock is Christ and if you come to the rock you come to Christ then you cannot come if you are not pulled he Jesus said himself no man can come to me except my father thrw him first all the father has given me will come to me no man can understand in who he is how it is except it is it is revealed to you by the re here is here we see plainly that God is revealed in Jesus Christ and only those who are for ordained to see it they will see it no man can come except my father throws him first and all the father has given me they will come they will recognize it and no other man can do it no other person no matter how good how good you are to be revealed to you then you see who Jesus Christ is it is revealed to you you will see who Jesus Christ is now here predestinate that plan in a plain [Music] view just as other seat the word of God is a seat and it must have a ground prepared before God in Sovereign Grace prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age if you have received him is not by accident it's not because you are you canot boast because it is he had prepared your heart before the foundation of the world so that you can receive in this age he for you you by his for [Music] knowledge you to come to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared [Music] you that is the reason you st you st out of these things in other words you go that way you go that way until you come to this place it was God leading you to to the place where he had ordained you to be when you go that way it was him saying come come come come come when you were praying there was saying come come by his longsuffering by his Mercy by his patience he was just waiting for you come my son come my [Applause] daughter they would they couldn't understand [Applause] you you were pulled something was pulling you to the place where you are now he says in Christ your heart pulls you because he had prepared it to be pulled in that c to be p in that it must be something pulling you you must have been part of that read Isaiah 51:1 there amen Isaiah 51 verse1 Isaiah 51 just read verse one there let's hear what you are saying there Heen to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek the Lord look unto The Rock when he are H and to the whole of the pit when he are G in other words you are you from The Rock if you are healed there space will remain for you then because you are healed you will come back when you come back you feed in that place because it is your place that was Moses place there God said come stand in this rock you have your place and I going put you in that place fed in that place because he was from beautiful amen if you are heed from the place the rock is Christ Christ is the we and you are the we you are part of the weight amen amen amen that is where you come from you are here because you come from somewhere the prophet says he says you being flesh and him being flesh then you can fellowship with one another because he was God's attributes of love God is love is that right Jesus Christ is God's attribute of Love attribute of love was displayed which was God himself all the attributes will come and hung and come to him all the father has given me will come to me he is an attribute we are attributes when that the first attribute when it is displayed the otherbut come [Applause] together all the father is given me will come to to me they had to be predestinated if it was you won't be there that's [Applause] all now we can Fellowship was through the riches of his way and in which you are part of you are part of the weight because he was the weight at the beginning you are the weight [Applause] now I am preaching tonight that is what the prophet is saying let's read let me read two one here A True predestinate Believer will stay with the way because they are part of the way he is the way you are part of the way if the way is displayed because You' been the part you will go to that [Music] [Applause] way you are you from the rock that's why you we know when Moses was building a temple at Jerusalem rocks were H at different places and come and J at Jerusalem when they were there then the builders start to build they just took the rock there and put it here when they took another one they found that it FS with this one then they take another one it with until they come one until they come to a certain Rock and that seems not very pecul they throw it away but this one cannot be usedful they go on building but when they come to the corner they look for the Stone to feed the corner there they look around the stones they are there they find no stone they go to the one they have thrown away they found that it FS the [Applause] place it was the rejected St amen am they just place a MTAR there they put the stone what is the m what is the m is love because the children of God are connected together by love that's why we don't have clicks that's why we don't have clicks groups groups the group of this one and that one and that we don't have SE in the message in the bride [Applause] group we are repellent we rep tell anything which is [Applause] not when it tries to come next to us want don't be attracted it repelled that is how they were coming together Christ is the rock now what did Moses see when he look when he was in that he saw the glory of God what what was that Glory he saw the back part of a man he was passing this you saw the back part where was he going he was going to Jerusalem what was he going to do there he was going to be put in [Applause] flesh then at our time what do you see that's why the prophet says in the book of seven Church ages he says Christ is moving between the [Applause] churches from church age to another church another church but the end there what do we hear we hear the what do we do he says he who open but when you when somebody ising when you open what do you see you see the face you don't see the back part you see the face what do we see at the age see the [Applause] face back out there at the beginning of Seven Seals when those seven angels come down in the pyramid form stood there and told me to return back here and speak on those Seven Seals he would be with me he showed me what they were those lost things I always thought it was seed outside the back of the book it would be something wrong in the book but it turned out that it was made known that he cannot do that the prophet thought to leave something written outside the book but he was told he cannot do that it is something that is written in the book is something that has been hi in the book forever ever shall take one weight from eat or add one weight to it so it is a mystery that is been in the book in these seven Church ages each one of them produce a mystery all about baptism Etc but then when that went up that big observatories from way down in California CL down in Mexico over to everywhere taking pictures it was a mysterious side but Brother s there sitting right back there and I brother je anding right there present when it went up they took the pictures still they don't know how about that here something some time ago everybody say look here this look like this and them Angels Wings how they are folded together one day I turn it to the right looking there it was Jesus Christ as perfect as of man's [Applause] head in some books he said go told him turn it like this when he turn it he saw that that is Christ what is it there is it after IT stand [Applause] like it was it was standing there with a wide Weck on looking down towards the Earth showing that he is the supreme authority Heavens declared it the Bible declares it the message declares it all the same supreme authority wi week on you see his black eye his black back many of you have seen there we got it back there just turn it to the right look at it he is just as perfect as it was what do you want to say we want to say Moses has seen the back part but we we the [Applause] and the that back part it was the glory of God are you together with because Moses asked to see the glory and God brought the glory to him when God was bringing the glory it was the back are you together the prophet said the glory of God is are you together the it is the glory of God let me read it here here is it now now here is what happened this just gets me right where I love it see the Locos that this great Fountain this great Fountain of spirit which had no beginning or no end this great spirit began to form in creation and the Lo that went out from it it was the son of God it was the only visible form that the spirit which means a body and the body was like a man Moses saw it what did Moses say the theop that is what the prophet say he says Moses saw it when it passed when it passed through the Rock and he looked at it it looked like the hand part of a [Music] man it was it that was the theop which was the son of God the Sun the logos become flesh because we were put in flesh Theos became flesh Among Us it was nothing else but the dwelling place of the entire [Music] fountain for Moses to see he had to get in a secret of God then he could see even you if you want to see the glory of God you must come to God's provided place if you come to God's provided Place himself put the but you have to come the god provided place amen that is where you see the glory of God not any other else if you go to some somewhere if you go somewhere you will see nothing come to the right place God will put you in the left was at the right right place read 2 Kings chapter 6 verse 15 Verse 6 verse 15 2 Kings chapter 6 verse 15 vers 15 and when the servant of the men of God was raisen early and gone forth behold and host Compass the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said un to him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them amen was at the right place he was where God is but he was not in the secret place but he was where God is he was at the provided place he was at the place where he could see then God the prophet as God take this man put him in a secret place so that he can see when he was there his eyes was open he could see he was there with the man of God he was at the right place he was where the Angels were he was where the Angels were guarding there they were guarded there but he couldn't see if you can if God can open your eyes if you can see you will worship at the right place the prophet says if God can open your eyes if you are here if God can open your eyes you will worship at this place you will never move if God can just open your eyes just like just like as he has opened would never move there he knew that we are protected even if God can open your eyes if you can see you will you will worship here the rest of your life [Applause] if was there but at the right place but not at the secret he was afraid at the right place but afraid you are afraid but the right place hallu oh my God you need don't worry God will take you and put you in the in his secret place then you will [Music] see there is something here let me try to compare scriptures and incidences with what I have read here read Isaiah chapter 35:8 Isaiah 35:3 Isaiah chapter 35:8 to 9 I want you to read there and and Highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of Holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those who wavering men thoughts fools shall not a therein no lion shall be there nor any rivers Beast shall go up there on it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there amen I'm talking about the provided Place provided by God and a secret place Isaiah is talking about something like that he says there is a highway there are people who are outside the highway but there are people who are in the highway but there is a way but those who are in the way in the way because that way is called a way of Hol and it says the unclean will never pass over they may pass through the highway but not in the Holiness he said that one is not for all in other words to P there must be transferred from a highway it be transferred into a way it's like the book of life and the Lamb's Book of Life because you are transed from the book of to the Book of Life the book of life you are transferred from the highway to the way because it says here it is not for all it is for those the way if though fools they will never get lost there as long as they they have been brought there if you can be transferred there fools you will never get lost there because it is your place when it goes on it makes me happy because it says it for it is for the redeemed those those are the redeemed are those who who who are H from the stone because if you are youth from there when you are brought back you are redeemed [Applause] amen it is for the redeemed the owner because to redeem it is to to bring back to the original in other words these people this is their place but when they say the are redeemed it means they come from somewhere they were here they went somewhere then they were they they they went God went there to pick them and bring them back to their original place where they could see where they could enjoy themselves where they could recognize themselves who they are because without being there never recognize [Applause] yourself it is for those they redeemed the Bible says so it is for those it's not for everybody if you are part it is for you amen let me read something here it says here but with theous it shall not be so they don't have to fear they've been redeemed by God they are they are in his bosom in other words this place here is the bosom of God they are the Overcomers and who is he that overcometh he that believeth that Jesus Christ that Jesus is Christ why will these Overcomers these Believers Escape go into the Realms of eternal life because Jesus Paid the price and Ransom us from sin he fill the gap of Separation we who were a far off are now made nigh by the blood and they will never come into condemnation that's why the Bible says here even if fools even if they are fools they will not they will never be lost he will lose none no one no one of the redeemed will be anywhere except where Jesus ISU they redeemed how does he bring them there he take the book of redemption open the book of when you open them their names are the prophet says here he says he he open the seals let me see if I can see it here how he calls them he says here the seals was broke why in the last Church age to reveal this [Music] truths the lamp broke the seals revealed them to his church in order to collect his subject for his kingdom to collect them he use seals without seals you cannot collect when you use you collect only the subject it is the voice voice of God that can be had by the redeemed in order to collect his subject for his kingdom PR Oh my he wants to bring this subject to him now he come to get this subject he revealed his Secrets they saw it [Applause] and time is no more time has run out it is finished for brother to see because he was reading a writing on the stone let me say this the writing on the it was God's provided [Music] place but the UN Stone it was the because see you have to be so that could to see that to know what is it he had to go and put Place into the he was placed in the pyramid it was the there so that he could see in the in the Pyramid of the Angels is where he could see outside there he couldn't see he could just read the writing on the this one is Paul this one is Martin this one is this one is that is what but when the stone is open it was wi there it moved from physical to Super he must go and be connected so he must go there to be connected he was transferred he didn't go there himself but he was transferred he was taken into that Pam he jump into that but he was taken pyamid in there there was a notable Angel he was connected with him then he came back he was another [Applause] let me see something here we have got something here coming to the end of our I say you must go to a sitting place the bride when the seals were open they were taking the briad and putting in a secret place when he was coming down he came down with a shout what is that shout it was the message going forth it was God's provided place the voice of the voice of God and the trumpet what is that voice what is that voice it is the voice of Resurrection what is that trumpet it was the The Calling To The [Applause] Feast the ministry of Noah we have said no preached until he got into a secret place when he was there no one could get there but he was preaching his last message the door until he got inside and the door was closed no one could get in no could get out even fools will never get out there because the door was closed was by God himself it was the last it was the message pre to the do this is the message now here we are in an aerplane the doors of an aane are close
