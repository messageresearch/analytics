[0:38] [Music]
[0:40] [Applause]
[0:43] [Music]
[0:47] thank you
[0:50] all right
[0:53] we are
[0:55] we want to thank God for this morning
[0:57] again
[1:01] and
[1:03] how we started yesterday with a terrible
[1:08] climate
[1:10] um
[1:13] and yet
[1:15] God wanted it to be that way although
[1:20] amen amen you know every child should be
[1:24] tested
[1:28] and so we yesterday we wanted it I mean
[1:33] we came here
[1:36] and then we could witness and see that
[1:40] the children of God here are a real
[1:43] qualities
[1:49] you reminded me of the places that we
[1:53] went to like in Mozambique City and
[1:58] sisters here are witnesses and in
[2:01] composite
[2:06] we went to a place where there's no Road
[2:11] and no Cafe no Bank no nothing amen
[2:22] amen but yet
[2:25] God is God's people who are they called
[2:29] amen
[2:33] and they do not have the taxi Texas mini
[2:37] buses like us
[2:40] is
[2:46] amen amen now
[2:49] um
[2:50] they have a bigger volume
[2:55] for to contain God let us water burning
[2:59] down
[3:02] amen amen when we preach there they
[3:06] always I I heard them shouting sure
[3:09] Pastor sure
[3:15] some without shoes
[3:20] uh but do I tell you
[3:24] that's where God turns better
[3:29] they don't have much of this world to
[3:32] contend with a banana okay
[3:39] we started by saying the final stage of
[3:42] the end time message is
[3:49] then we picked up later a text
[3:58] do you still remember what was it
[4:03] okay
[4:07] and we promised that we look at the
[4:13] that's it through mystery
[4:18] um
[4:21] it is still the same it's a massage
[4:25] it's still the final stage of the
[4:36] [Music]
[4:36] um
[4:37] but this morning
[4:40] we we just went for a few minutes to
[4:45] come from that stage to
[4:48] to where the bride is because
[4:58] the bride today is not a singular woman
[5:02] no namsa
[5:06] no she's married amen
[5:11] now a married woman has some rights
[5:14] Hallelujah
[5:18] and the Bible says if there's something
[5:22] she doesn't understand she will ask the
[5:25] husband amen
[5:31] but
[5:34] the husband also will always consider
[5:38] his wife
[5:46] everything that she know he knows of
[5:50] um
[5:54] so that the wife don't won't depend on
[5:57] any other man amen
[6:02] amen
[6:04] all right amen the bride has to depend
[6:08] on her husband
[6:11] um
[6:15] when God
[6:17] as he was doing his rounds he met
[6:20] Abraham about
[6:25] and coming down to Sodom he first met
[6:30] Abraham and said shall I hide from
[6:33] Abraham the thing that I do yes
[6:42] so God who didn't do anything without
[6:45] first discussing it with Abraham
[6:49] [Applause]
[6:55] the
[6:59] husband will never do anything
[7:04] without first making known to his wife
[7:08] okay
[7:10] so that the wife don't go won't go
[7:13] around asking some other men
[7:18] amen amen that's why we should take it
[7:23] from the husband
[7:26] now we'll start from here leading to
[7:30] that
[7:33] and now let's tend to
[7:37] uh I will start from
[7:41] John Chapter 14 verse 20 to 21.
[7:50] amen amen
[7:55] all right
[7:58] maybe before we read the word of God
[8:02] we
[8:04] going to
[8:05] ask for a prayer
[8:08] foreign
[8:16] Heavenly Father we are so glad
[8:20] to be in this place this piece of ground
[8:24] clear father
[8:26] dwells the people who were there before
[8:28] the foundation of the world Hallelujah
[8:31] and you let us you have led us this far
[8:35] amen just to come to a
[8:38] uh share with our brothers and sisters
[8:42] together the things that they we had
[8:46] shared together amen before there was
[8:49] the prophet says before there was even
[8:51] any Angel yes we were there in him yeah
[8:56] and father we are here to remind
[8:59] ourselves and share together
[9:02] the things that they were there before
[9:05] and there was any Angel yes and that's
[9:08] why today Father The Authority is given
[9:12] to men yes not even the angels cannot
[9:15] know about the secrets that are known
[9:18] made known to me yes
[9:21] Peter in the Bible says
[9:24] even the angels desire to see the things
[9:28] that we see today amen and father we are
[9:31] so blessed with that even in this humble
[9:34] place yes no father as we are here in
[9:38] this very humble Place amen which looks
[9:40] so primitive yes yet the almighty God
[9:44] and knows this place yes and has put his
[9:48] people here Amen to shine as the stars
[9:51] of Heaven Hallelujah and we hear further
[9:54] as they open their mouths yes that
[9:56] there's something deep in their hearts
[9:59] rooted and father we believe we are in
[10:02] the right place at the right time to
[10:05] appreciate to the seed yes as I pray in
[10:09] Jesus Christ's name amen
[10:11] uh

[10:20] my father and you in me and I in you
[10:26] he that had my commandment and keep at
[10:29] them yes he it is that love to me and he
[10:34] that loved me shall be loved of my
[10:37] father and I will love him and will
[10:40] manifest myself to him amen
[10:43] 20.
[11:05] this is
[11:08] amen amen you may be seated God bless
[11:11] you
[11:13] know
[11:15] so are we
[11:17] happy this morning
[11:20] amen amen
[11:24] you know I will read
[11:26] some things here starting with
[11:30] uh
[11:31] the individuals and so Funda is into our
[11:35] point
[11:36] we we want to
[11:40] uh
[11:42] locate
[11:45] the god of Elijah yes
[11:52] because we know very well that he was
[11:55] coming to his body yeah
[12:02] and we want to see him in the body SMS
[12:10] we also we want to see him in the
[12:13] individual hey
[12:18] each and every one of us
[12:22] must have him in his heart
[12:26] his way amen and this is what makes the
[12:30] bride of Christ
[12:33] is the individuals
[12:37] God has brought together
[12:42] sharing the same ex Supernatural
[12:45] experience
[12:49] amen amen so we are looking at those
[12:53] things
[12:57] we want to worship the god of brothers
[13:04] [Applause]
[13:06] and not only read the spoken word
[13:11] but to worship the god of Brothers
[13:18] speaks of Elisha
[13:22] that Elisha was he typed the pride of
[13:26] Christ
[13:30] and he ended up with the spirit of
[13:33] Elijah in him
[13:42] and when he was coming back with the
[13:44] spirit of Elijah from over Jordan
[13:51] he cried out and said where is the god
[13:54] of Elijah
[13:56] foreign
[14:48] to show that we have believed
[14:53] and when he was coming back
[14:57] the sons of God who stood afarof
[15:04] then when they looked
[15:09] they saw him coming yeah
[15:13] coming back with their power
[15:18] and the world today is been waiting for
[15:22] the manifestation of the sons of God
[15:28] not waiting for them to come with a
[15:31] history I
[15:34] or confusion
[15:36] not to come with the power
[15:40] amen amen because they were with Elijah
[15:46] then when the sons of God looked from
[15:49] afarof
[15:52] they saw that the spirit of Elijah was
[15:55] in Elijah
[15:59] because even the Disciples of the Lord
[16:03] Jesus Christ
[16:05] when they saw them
[16:08] doing the things that they were doing
[16:12] they said but it is because they were
[16:15] with Jesus
[16:18] [Applause]
[16:20] so you need to reflect
[16:23] if you were with Elijah you will reflect
[16:26] Elijah
[16:27] [Applause]
[16:29] if you were with Jesus Christ you will
[16:31] reflect Jesus
[16:35] the church today the bride should be a
[16:37] reflection
[16:41] so that the people can say uh
[16:46] they were with Elijah
[16:49] amen amen all right so this is what we
[16:54] need to see this is Born the
[16:56] manifestation of the sons of God
[17:01] okay
[17:03] now we'll start here
[17:06] the prophet speaks of the you know in
[17:10] you there's some Realms or Dimensions
[17:20] now he says a real believer and when the
[17:24] Holy Spirit that the real believer is
[17:27] Anointed with is
[17:52] this is Christ refuting in his own word
[17:59] the old scripture page seven amen

[19:45] the Shekinah Glory race from that messy
[19:48] seat one day and it settled on another
[19:50] Tabernacle foreign
[20:00] and the prophet says
[20:04] the father judges no man but he's
[20:07] committed all judgment to the son that's
[20:10] the Bible says so
[20:12] um
[20:16] God's judgment City
[20:21] and the Lord Jesus says you speak

[21:04] um
[21:12] if it is now in the body

[21:19] Ghost speaking now from the third
[21:25] it shall never be forgiven our souls
[21:30] amen
[21:31] go right amen then
[21:35] because he says

[21:43] the second Throne was in Christ
[21:47] the third Throne is in a man

[22:23] that will make the bride of Christ
[22:28] who is this bright
[22:32] the bride of Christ
[22:34] is coming from the seven Church ages
[22:42] brother Branham says God has been
[22:46] selecting some people from the
[22:48] churchages
[22:53] and every Church age produced twins yeah
[23:01] says the prophet
[23:03] the canal and the spiritual
[23:08] every church
[23:11] now it always ends up with the
[23:14] Overcomers
[23:17] now he says now God has been selecting
[23:23] overcome us from the every Church age
[23:26] ever
[23:33] makes the bride of Christ
[23:37] so the bread of Christ is made of
[23:40] Overcomers
[23:45] it's a church age
[23:51] produced twins yeah
[24:10] [Applause]
[24:18] all right now
[24:21] and then after the seven Church ages
[24:25] time is then we see the bride of Christ
[24:31] and the others they also constitute and
[24:35] make a church
[24:46] Jesus was kicked out of the church
[24:52] because if you deny him to be who he is
[24:56] you are kicking him out
[25:04] to say
[25:06] the seventh seal is not revealed you are
[25:09] kicking him out
[25:09] [Applause]
[25:15] you'll see it here in the waiting
[25:18] because he is the sins that were
[25:22] revealed
[25:23] [Applause]
[25:28] is he six six seals
[25:31] he is
[25:39] now there is a
[25:41] there is what we call the word of God
[25:45] and there is the revealed word of God
[25:48] [Music]
[25:53] there is something in this book
[25:58] the unveiling of God we can read that
[26:03] we should know between the weight and
[26:06] the revealed words
[26:16] it says
[26:19] to us
[26:22] I will study
[26:25] so now we are invited into him
[26:29] um
[26:31] to be partakers of all that he is
[26:38] maybe you didn't hear it
[26:40] to be partakers
[26:49] Hallelujah
[26:52] can somebody
[26:54] accept it
[26:57] amen
[26:58] because he says
[27:00] that day he shall know that I am in the
[27:04] father
[27:07] you and me
[27:09] and I in you
[27:12] amen now you've got to take note of the
[27:15] third
[27:17] the third is
[27:25] now let this one sink
[27:28] they said you start is I
[27:31] um
[27:36] [Applause]
[27:40] it should end
[27:41] it ends up
[27:43] there in US amen
[27:49] okay now those who followed who who
[27:54] followed Elijah
[27:59] for some kilometers
[28:03] and he was off their screen
[28:08] because he went to Jordan
[28:11] now there was this man Elijah
[28:15] who went there
[28:18] and cross Jordan with Elijah
[28:32] and when he crossed to the seals they
[28:35] crossed with him
[28:37] yeah
[28:39] but others remain in Louisiana
[28:44] so there's others who remain on this
[28:47] side of Jordan
[28:50] amen amen and those who remain on this
[28:54] side
[28:57] the message
[29:01] um
[29:02] the message on this side on the other
[29:06] open
[29:08] who was in the second pool
[29:13] not the third I understand
[29:16] so their message was the second full
[29:19] message
[29:20] um
[29:23] in the wilderness
[29:27] and they disputed Caleb and Joshua but
[29:30] USANA
[29:32] because
[29:33] they believed
[29:41] [Applause]
[29:43] listen to this
[29:45] brother Brennan says
[29:48] now the book of Ephesians I I was just
[29:51] saying
[29:54] is one of the greatest books of the New
[29:57] Testament
[30:00] it leads us onward yeah foreign
[30:10] [Applause]
[30:21] the greatest books
[30:23] of them all Ephesians
[30:28] draws together
[30:32] and positionally places the church
[30:35] Ephesians
[30:41] pleases the church
[30:46] because brother prelim says
[30:50] those men from the majors
[30:54] [Music]
[30:58] I'll quote to you what he says
[31:02] he says they were in a certain place
[31:08] in a certain position
[31:11] now they could see that stuff from a
[31:14] certain position
[31:18] they were placed in a certain position
[31:23] from that position
[31:25] they could see that stuff
[31:30] amen I've got it in the oh here here it
[31:34] is and here it is here
[31:39] now when they were coming
[31:42] the book of Ephesians
[31:45] places you in a certain position
[31:52] uh
[31:59] they were on cameras
[32:02] they were they were on camels
[32:07] they went two years down across the
[32:09] Tigress river
[32:14] and through the swims jungles
[32:20] going to the city
[32:23] has filled with joy
[32:26] they knew when those stars were hanging
[32:29] in there
[32:32] even the astronomers the astronomers say
[32:36] today if if they actually those stars
[32:40] come into one place again it would make
[32:43] one star and
[32:45] [Music]
[32:51] those those stars were actually angels
[32:56] in the form of a star
[32:58] yeah
[33:03] if those stars come into one place again
[33:07] it would make one star from when they
[33:10] are they are standing yeah
[33:21] that's why when I read in the Bible
[33:23] and it tells me of the Angel of the Lord
[33:30] an angel to testify to the seven Church
[33:33] ages
[33:37] now to us from where we are standing it
[33:41] brings one engine
[33:43] [Applause]
[33:46] the angel of the seven Church ages
[33:50] because he's the one who has shown us
[33:52] the seven churches
[33:54] [Applause]
[33:56] because you are standing between Time
[33:59] and Eternity
[34:02] now the prophet says
[34:08] but they had to be standing from that
[34:11] place to see it the woman amen
[34:19] some couldn't see it
[34:22] because of the position
[34:26] from a certain position you can't see it
[34:31] you need to be in a certain position
[34:37] you need to choose the right place to
[34:40] worship
[34:43] where you can see these things
[34:47] it can be seen from any other group I
[34:51] was gonna
[34:52] you've got to be in the right place
[34:57] for a focus
[35:01] [Applause]
[35:02] so it says they had to be standing from
[35:07] that place to see it
[35:12] then he continues the prophets
[35:15] it depends on where you are standing
[35:23] if you come and tell me
[35:25] that it is not revealed I asked you know
[35:36] I know it is because of the position you
[35:40] are the is
[35:44] that my position is very important
[35:50] you must you must be in the right
[35:53] position to see
[35:55] um
[35:59] that's why
[36:01] you know the Bible says
[36:03] I'll read it something quickly here
[36:10] here
[36:23] verse 9.
[36:25] and they came they came unto me one of
[36:29] the Seven Angels who had the seven bowls
[36:32] full of the seven last plagues and
[36:34] talked with me saying come here I will
[36:38] show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife
[36:58] now did you hear
[37:01] me come
[37:03] on
[37:04] yeah
[37:11] I I want meaning I want to show you
[37:14] something
[37:15] but you need to come here
[37:18] [Applause]
[37:20] in order to see it
[37:24] okay
[37:29] I will show Thee the bride
[37:31] is
[37:35] everybody says we are the bread of
[37:37] Christ we are the bread of Christ but
[37:39] you should be in a position
[37:41] [Applause]
[37:43] where you can really see the bride
[37:47] that's why this morning we want to see
[37:49] the bride
[37:51] which one is the bride because everybody
[37:53] is a bride welcome to
[37:56] makoti amen
[37:59] we don't have pieces of the bride of
[38:02] Christ
[38:05] is
[38:06] the blood of Christ is the people
[38:09] selected the Overcomers
[38:17] selected out of every Church age
[38:23] these are the people the prophet says
[38:25] are going to find the battle of
[38:27] Armageddon
[38:29] [Applause]
[38:31] [Music]
[38:32] [Applause]
[38:34] Army oh
[38:36] um
[38:39] the people who stood for the Lord
[38:44] amen
[38:46] come
[39:00] you need to come here
[39:04] that is one of the seven angels
[39:08] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[39:11] a great and high mountain
[39:16] easy
[39:22] the end of the seven Church ages
[39:26] is the top of the mountain
[39:30] man once you are when you are on top of
[39:33] the mountain
[39:35] you are in the middle spot who said that
[39:39] when impact
[39:41] you you can see down
[39:45] [Applause]
[39:48] you are on top of the mountain
[39:51] that's why God took Moses to the top
[39:56] to speak with him
[39:59] and the time Moses was coming back
[40:03] he covered his face
[40:06] because he has seen God
[40:09] from the
[40:11] top
[40:13] from Beyond the church ages
[40:18] on top of the mountains
[40:20] so so he summoned him to come there so
[40:24] watch him against the apple and he
[40:26] carried me away in the spirit to a great
[40:30] and high mountain and showed me that
[40:33] great City the holy Jerusalem yes
[40:41] um
[40:44] now we are starting with a position as
[40:47] Tata is
[40:50] from today
[40:51] I I should know the right the right
[40:55] place
[40:56] if I want to see these things
[41:00] [Applause]
[41:03] chapter 4 of the same book Revelation uh
[41:07] it's chapter four
[41:10] after this this one after this I looked
[41:13] and behold the door was opened in heaven
[41:16] [Music]
[41:28] thank God for ascending a prophet
[41:32] um
[41:35] we should salute God
[41:39] [Applause]
[41:42] after this after the seven churches
[41:46] I looked and behold a door was open in
[41:50] heaven
[41:52] because when you are on top of of the
[41:55] highest mountains
[41:58] then there's nothing
[42:00] as you look up according to a evening
[42:04] it's now the door
[42:09] amen you are in the middle
[42:13] the right spot to see down and up in
[42:16] town
[42:19] and the first voice that I heard was as
[42:22] it were over trumpet talking with me it
[42:25] is
[42:31] you know again come up here
[42:36] amen amen yeah you want to see something
[42:40] come up
[42:42] yeah
[42:45] you will have a better viewing of things
[42:51] and I will show these things which must
[42:54] be here after
[42:56] um
[42:59] only after you have
[43:03] um
[43:07] [Applause]
[43:21] where you don't leave the church
[43:25] the service with questions
[43:32] listen
[43:36] my man going to church
[43:43] you are always there's something in you
[43:45] babbling
[43:49] amen as you think of going to
[43:53] the service
[43:55] meeting with the Brethren there's
[43:59] something already bubbling in you
[44:02] when when you think how is gonna be
[44:07] amen say you start singing while
[44:13] preparing yourself on a Sunday morning
[44:17] come and go with me to my father's house
[44:22] you see you start singing amen
[44:25] but
[44:27] if you go to church
[44:35] [Applause]
[44:37] you know that brother doesn't know what
[44:39] he's talking about
[44:42] you are not going to worship I
[44:45] hope you are starting from a weak point
[44:48] [Applause]
[44:50] you are fainting already before you get
[44:53] to church
[44:55] because you don't expect to hear
[44:57] anything from God
[44:59] but a true worshiper is somebody who
[45:03] goes to the right place
[45:04] where where he knows that in the house
[45:08] of the Lord
[45:10] he will hear from God
[45:14] that's a true worshiper
[45:16] he goes to service with a song
[45:20] he's coming back with a song
[45:23] and he can go around sharing with the
[45:26] people the word of God
[45:30] amen amen amen amen then he can testify
[45:33] around
[45:35] uh even tomorrow he'll tell the people
[45:39] come and go with me to the house of the
[45:42] Lord
[45:43] because in the house of the Lord
[45:46] that's where
[45:47] we hear the oracles the voice of God and
[45:52] we come there not empty-handed
[46:03] from the Revival
[46:06] people coming from the Revival back from
[46:08] the Revival sitting on the sofas
[46:16] a
[46:19] hey yes
[46:24] amen that's not worshiping God
[46:29] can I pass this area
[46:31] [Applause]
[46:33] in the place of worship the Lord Jesus
[46:37] says the two worshipers
[46:40] shall worship
[46:47] he didn't even say God he says the
[46:50] father
[46:51] foreign because everybody claims to be
[46:55] worshiping God
[46:58] but the father means the
[47:02] jail
[47:04] the Jesus shall worship their father
[47:08] in truth and in spirit
[47:11] [Applause]
[47:13] because you go everywhere
[47:15] you can start now it's Sunday morning
[47:20] everywhere you go
[47:23] Jesus Jesus you 've got
[47:27] this but what are you doing
[47:32] that is
[47:37] that means there's false worshipers
[47:41] no the true worshipers shall worship
[47:45] their father
[47:47] in spirit and the truth
[47:51] for the father one such to worship Him
[47:58] he won't accept any kind of worship
[48:03] it depends on where you are
[48:08] made
[48:10] [Applause]
[48:12] I thought you would be my man
[48:14] I'm a man a man
[48:17] and it depends on where you are standing
[48:20] [Music]
[48:22] it depends on what you are looking at
[48:27] so they have seen it
[48:31] these three measures
[48:33] they followed it and they were right in
[48:37] line
[48:43] [Music]
[48:45] it was right in line with them
[48:49] it land it led to them
[48:53] you know so
[48:56] that's it
[48:58] will always take you here to the right
[49:02] place
[49:05] where the Messiah was born
[49:12] but when they reach Jerusalem
[49:14] they went into the temple
[49:18] in the temple
[49:21] they opened the Scrolls the ministers
[49:24] [Music]

[49:39] these ones the majors
[49:44] their Ministry was positive
[49:48] where is
[49:52] amen

[49:57] the reading of a scripture
[49:59] is bad
[50:03] because now it's where is he
[50:10] who is
[50:16] King of the Jews
[50:20] now when they asked the question in the
[50:22] temple

[50:28] unfolded the scroll
[50:33] Isaiah says
[50:35] Behold a son is born unto us
[50:41] so they spoke read about Bethlehem
[50:44] that the governor shall come out of thee
[50:50] amen amen and the three measures
[50:53] they continue to say but
[50:56] where is it
[51:00] because
[51:03] that scripture is being fulfilled
[51:09] but to them
[51:11] they are still in their reading
[51:14] dispensation amen
[51:20] brother Brennan says
[51:22] [Music]
[51:25] after 10 years brother Branham says
[51:29] no manifestations
[51:33] we as the members of The Pride
[51:37] foreign

[1:01:18] after the seven churches
[1:01:21] Behold a door was open in heaven
[1:01:25] and the first voice that I heard was as
[1:01:28] it were of a trumpet talking with me
[1:01:33] which said come up foreign
[1:01:46] [Applause]
[1:02:01] a man
[1:02:03] hereafter
[1:02:08] so
[1:02:09] the things that happened after brother
[1:02:11] Brennan said something is the distance
[1:02:20] and those things happened
[1:02:24] so you need to come
[1:02:27] okay amen now finally let's look at this
[1:02:33] um
[1:02:36] I'm looking at
[1:02:39] you know the seventh seal if you don't
[1:02:42] understand
[1:02:43] if we were to
[1:02:45] even some some someday we we talked
[1:02:49] about it
[1:02:53] and uh
[1:02:56] the people those
[1:03:01] amen
[1:03:03] and the one brother from Congo said to
[1:03:06] me
[1:03:11] no let me just say a brother
[1:03:14] um
[1:03:20] I found myself sleeping
[1:03:23] I said
[1:03:26] I said brother it was Mount
[1:03:28] Transfiguration
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:42] they look at Jim with one eye like this
[1:03:44] and
[1:03:48] [Applause]
[1:03:53] Sunny Lane
[1:04:01] so that was more Transfiguration
[1:04:05] foreign
[1:04:20] they were supposed to pray
[1:04:26] one day I was listening to a brother
[1:04:31] we were in Mozambique Mr
[1:04:34] we slept in a place they were in another
[1:04:37] room
[1:04:41] I know why brother my cities love you
[1:04:43] yeah
[1:04:45] so there's this night prayer you know
[1:04:51] sometimes it is just forced upon the
[1:04:54] people we must pray before you you go to
[1:04:57] bed

[1:05:27] 40 days
[1:05:30] we are not Jesus
[1:05:38] this Brothers
[1:05:40] I'm listening the brother was trying to
[1:05:43] pray
[1:05:47] he never reached the amen amen
[1:05:53] is
[1:06:03] because it's not a prayer
[1:06:07] it is
[1:06:09] under a law
[1:06:12] prayer is something it's a spirit
[1:06:15] oh
[1:06:19] man
[1:06:23] a brother
[1:06:26] I received a message from
[1:06:29] uh Church of Christ

[1:06:35] mountains
[1:06:37] everyone will one will kneel here
[1:06:40] another one there another one

[1:06:59] sorry he says no I I know the mountain
[1:07:03] they went to the island
[1:07:05] while we each and everyone is praying in
[1:07:08] his corner
[1:07:11] now it happened that one brother
[1:07:14] where he knelt to pray
[1:07:17] there was a bed a nesting on in that
[1:07:22] tree
[1:07:51] these others also hearing the noise of
[1:07:54] somebody running away
[1:07:56] foreign

[1:08:30] time
[1:08:32] they called for a fast on every Tuesday
[1:08:39] they called for that
[1:08:41] me I have never
[1:08:46] because I didn't know what for

[1:09:00] now during the day
[1:09:02] on Tuesday because I was open to them
[1:09:06] that they know I can't fast I don't know

[1:09:53] that today
[1:10:04] no I can't stay without food
[1:10:09] you're all right but every Tuesday night

[1:10:16] whose testimonies that day because of
[1:10:20] fasting during the day

[1:11:00] at the church where they used to worship
[1:11:04] they would all speak in tongues
[1:11:11] amen then he says now you couldn't yeah

[1:11:20] for to for those things
[1:11:25] now he said how did you do it brother
[1:11:27] hope

[1:12:01] tongues
[1:12:01] [Applause]
[1:12:04] and until I flopped
[1:12:07] and left the church because I couldn't
[1:12:11] do the way
[1:12:13] they do it I said the problem brother is
[1:12:18] that brother Brenham says because he was
