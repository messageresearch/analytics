[0:03] [Music]
[0:31] David said
[0:33] he was happy when he
[0:36] &gt;&gt; and said to him, "Let us go into the
[0:39] house of the Lord.
[0:40] [Music]
[0:41] And I'm also happy to be here
[0:46] with my pastor
[0:50] and all my friends
[0:53] who who is part of my home.
[0:56] And
[0:58] &gt;&gt; so I'm so thankful to God that
[1:03] in this last days
[1:06] he brought us together again. We are
[1:09] together again.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; And as we were together
[1:14] &gt;&gt; and before the foundation of the world
[1:17] &gt;&gt; and we are together again.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenam says
[1:23] this is the the last gathering.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; The gathering of the eagles.
[1:32] [Music]
[1:34] &gt;&gt; The deed.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then we are so happy.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; This morning
[1:41] [Music]
[1:43] &gt;&gt; there was no place I could go to this
[1:46] morning.
[1:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; But to this place
[1:51] &gt;&gt; where the eagles are gathered together.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's where we find our
[1:59] beings.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Pastor
[2:05] S. Amen.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:07] [Music]
[2:09] &gt;&gt; we I enjoyed the singing so much.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; That
[2:15] I just feel that we are
[2:18] &gt;&gt; in heaven places
[2:22] &gt;&gt; and
[2:25] it gives us joy.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; Now I'm here to
[2:30] support my pastor here.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you know we always believe
[2:35] that no one can speak better
[2:40] &gt;&gt; than God.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:46] And that's why we all believe that we
[2:50] are just all equals
[2:53] &gt;&gt; and uh in equals is that one is made a
[2:57] pastor to speak
[2:59] &gt;&gt; the other one is the hearer
[3:03] &gt;&gt; but we are just all equals
[3:07] &gt;&gt; you know I I understand that
[3:11] the teacher in the classroom
[3:14] And his job is to reveal what is in a
[3:17] student.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Something in a student.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; And the work of a teacher is to reveal
[3:29] that
[3:32] &gt;&gt; and
[3:34] I understand if you fail standard six
[3:36] maybe three times or what it is because
[3:40] you don't have standard
[3:41] &gt;&gt; six.
[3:42] Amen.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; So
[3:46] &gt;&gt; it's the same thing in God.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Says
[3:51] the people who are here in the spiritual
[3:55] realms
[3:56] &gt;&gt; were there before.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; And the overcomers here
[4:03] &gt;&gt; were they overcame there.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; When there was a war in heaven, they
[4:10] were on the side of God. Yes.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; And because they overcame
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Then they will overcome.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; They are not newcomers in this field.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; No.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; And so this what why we what we believe
[4:27] that because we were there brother says
[4:31] h we no one can see these things unless
[4:35] he was there.
[4:38] That means you won't see it from here
[4:42] &gt;&gt; from there.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; And uh so this is what we we have seen
[4:50] in the last days
[4:51] &gt;&gt; that you hear because you
[4:56] &gt;&gt; amen.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; You see because you have seen
[5:01] &gt;&gt; you see because you have seen.
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; All right.
[5:05] Okay, let's turn back to our
[5:09] you know I I don't know especially on
[5:12] the first day like Sunday I just want to
[5:15] relax
[5:17] &gt;&gt; you know brother says this is relaxation
[5:21] &gt;&gt; because you are a child of God
[5:23] &gt;&gt; there's nothing to fear
[5:26] &gt;&gt; you don't we don't go to heaven because
[5:28] we fear to go to hell
[5:31] &gt;&gt; we are citizens
[5:32] [Music]
[5:35] We are citizens of heaven.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; We don't come to church because we fear
[5:42] to go to hell or we fear condemnation.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; We are citizens.
[5:50] [Music]
[5:51] &gt;&gt; Uh I will turn to Daniel chapter 12
[5:54] again as we will just continue uh from
[5:57] when where we left yesterday.
[6:01] I think
[6:04] always
[6:07] feel like
[6:18] yeah
[6:20] and and at that time that is Daniel
[6:24] chapter 12.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. H so we are all here to rejoice
[6:29] again.
[6:31] &gt;&gt; Paul says rejoice in the Lord and I say
[6:35] rejoice.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; Now let's make this Sunday
[6:40] also another wonderful Sunday.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; The first day of the week.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; H which is the day of resurrection.
[6:52] And uh so um it is our day to observe.
[6:58] And at that time shall Michael stand up
[7:02] the great prince who standeth for the
[7:04] children of thy people. And there shall
[7:07] be a time of trouble such as never was
[7:10] since there was a nation even to that
[7:14] same time at at that time thy people
[7:18] shall be delivered everyone that shall
[7:22] be found written in the book.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; And I will turn to verse six. And one
[7:29] one said or verse five. Daniel and I,
[7:34] Daniel looked, and behold, there was
[7:36] stood two men,
[7:37] &gt;&gt; the other on this side of the bank
[7:41] of the river, and the other on the other
[7:44] side of the river.
[7:46] &gt;&gt; One said to the men clothed in linen,
[7:48] who was above the waters of the river,
[7:51] how long shall it be
[7:53] &gt;&gt; to the end of uh this wonders? And I had
[7:58] the man clothed in linen who was above
[8:01] the waters of the river when he held up
[8:04] his hand and his left hand
[8:07] &gt;&gt; uh unto heaven. And so by him who live
[8:11] forever
[8:13] uh what it shall be for a time and times
[8:16] and and have and uh which he shall have
[8:21] accomplished.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Uh the breaking up of the power of the
[8:25] holy people shall these things
[8:28] uh shall be finished.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Heavenly Father, it's
[8:35] another wonderful time. Wow.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; That day for us to come
[8:42] &gt;&gt; under this roof in the house of the Lord
[8:46] &gt;&gt; for to worship.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; And we know how we rejoice when we saw
[8:53] you.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; Claiming the framework.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; And we as the stars of heaven.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; Rejoice before the foundation of the
[9:02] world.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; How much shall we rejoice?
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; If we see these things now. Yes.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Coming to a manifestation.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; We praise you, Father, and exalt your
[9:13] name
[9:14] &gt;&gt; as we are here to hear from you again in
[9:17] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. God bless you.
[9:25] [Music]
[9:27] Now, um
[9:29] as we are
[9:32] here
[9:34] again this
[9:36] this morning.
[9:40] Okay. Um
[9:45] now we were looking at the pyramid.
[9:49] Amen.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; And uh
[9:54] whatever city is this thing on.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[10:00] And uh we were up to the transition
[10:04] period
[10:08] &gt;&gt; where we see a girl. Hey,
[10:12] &gt;&gt; and uh that's where if you read seals
[10:17] chapter
[10:19] uh page 74.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; All right.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; I will read this part here. Page 74.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:34] Just as John was giving his message the
[10:37] same time that Messiah came in the days,
[10:42] John knew he would see him
[10:45] &gt;&gt; because he was going to introduce him.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; And we realize that in the scriptures
[10:51] over in Malachi 4, there's to be a one
[10:55] like John
[10:56] &gt;&gt; and Elijah to him the word of God can
[11:00] come to. Amen.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; And he is to reveal by the Holy Spirit
[11:06] all the mysteries of God and restore the
[11:10] faith of the children back to the faith
[11:12] of the apostolic fathers.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Restore back all the mysteries that's
[11:18] been proved at through this
[11:21] denominational. Yes.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; Now that's what the word said.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; I'm just responsible for what it says.
[11:28] It's written. It's written.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; Now we see that this seven sealed book
[11:35] is the mystery of redemption.
[11:41] [Music]
[11:42] &gt;&gt; Now redemption
[11:44] as we all know
[11:47] is to take something back to its
[11:49] original place.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Redemption.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Now you are redeemed back to your
[11:56] original place.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh now we should know
[12:03] uh which place is our original place.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; You know brother Brennan says
[12:10] uh when God made you, he made you as
[12:13] your father.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Uh as he condescended from being a
[12:19] spirit
[12:20] &gt;&gt; in the rainbow form and condescended
[12:24] into a logos.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. which the prophet says it's logos.
[12:29] It's a
[12:32] Christ is the way.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; So the same is the logos the Christ is
[12:40] the way.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Now he says that's where we were.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Because we come down in a threefold
[12:52] system.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Glory. You know our God is systematic
[12:57] &gt;&gt; and he does things systematic
[13:01] &gt;&gt; and so now we we come down a a system
[13:05] the way he came.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; That's the way we came.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; We come
[13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; As the prophet says for God to come to
[13:15] you, he has to come in three steps.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. That's when he has reached.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; And h the spirit logos. Amen.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; So it's threefold.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; And so now because in the book Christ is
[13:40] the mystery of God revealed, he tells
[13:41] you that the bride is part of this
[13:45] three-fold mystery.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Uh you you you don't receive it by
[13:53] maybe
[13:55] uh raising up your hand
[13:57] &gt;&gt; but you rece you receive it as part of
[14:00] it.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; Because uh part of God was there before.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; We always read in the book that the
[14:12] Bible says in the beginning was the
[14:13] word. The word was with God and the word
[14:16] was God. And the Bible and verse six
[14:19] says and there was a man sent from God.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Amen.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Now if you you look at it carefully
[14:27] &gt;&gt; is that the word was God
[14:31] &gt;&gt; and there was a man sent from God.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Now it always we we always explain it's
[14:41] not as a man sent by God.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; No. No.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; But is a man sent from God.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; From God. Amen.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; Something that is sent from God be part
[14:51] of God.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; That's why he's not sent by God. He is
[14:58] sent from God.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; So that means he is part of God in so
[15:06] much that
[15:08] &gt;&gt; when he was on the he appeared on the
[15:10] scene
[15:12] &gt;&gt; men were sent
[15:14] &gt;&gt; to check whether he
[15:16] &gt;&gt; be the Christ of God
[15:18] &gt;&gt; and they said I am the voice
[15:21] &gt;&gt; of the one crying in the wilderness
[15:24] &gt;&gt; that is Isaiah 40 exactly
[15:26] &gt;&gt; which is his position in the scripture.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so each and every one of us
[15:34] today must find his position
[15:37] &gt;&gt; in the way.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; As the Lord Jesus also, they handed to
[15:43] him the scroll.
[15:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says when he opened it, he
[15:48] found a place
[15:51] &gt;&gt; where it is written, "The spirit of the
[15:53] Lord is upon me."
[15:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; Which is his part in the word.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:59] as now we believe the message and what
[16:02] we believe
[16:04] &gt;&gt; because it's our part in the message.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; So now um if if I am not part of him
[16:16] &gt;&gt; then
[16:18] the word calls me an outsider.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; H
[16:25] now it says I I will read this now
[16:29] &gt;&gt; as we see Revelation 10 verse 5
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Daniel 12:5
[16:37] &gt;&gt; they speak of an announcement
[16:41] &gt;&gt; and the angel said the time shall be no
[16:44] moreise
[16:46] &gt;&gt; and you can see the the very same same
[16:50] the two scriptures are identical. Yeah,
[16:54] &gt;&gt; because he's there at the river and you
[16:57] read there at the angel also because
[17:01] when he stepped one foot on the sea and
[17:03] the other on the land
[17:05] &gt;&gt; h the prophet tells me that the seventh
[17:09] angel messenger
[17:11] &gt;&gt; was here
[17:14] &gt;&gt; says he saw him when he stepped one foot
[17:18] on the
[17:21] Because one beast came out of the sea
[17:25] and the other out of the land.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; So now and he said I will make my means
[17:33] my enemies a foottool. So that means one
[17:37] beast out of the land one of the of the
[17:40] sea. That's why now he stepped one
[17:44] foot on the land and one foot on the
[17:47] sea. So now it shows that
[17:50] the seventh seal.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; The seven seal.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Put Satan not
[18:03] &gt;&gt; so why because the my prophet tells me
[18:07] that
[18:09] &gt;&gt; the Satan don't know about the seven.
[18:15] Why we do a silent
[18:23] &gt;&gt; so that you switch off the activity.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; For a time
[18:29] &gt;&gt; because something was happening.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:34] Now,
[18:36] now
[18:38] says
[18:40] this, this is not revealed to the
[18:42] public.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; No.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; He says now then he says I feel checked.
[18:48] Yes.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; You know, because he says h
[18:56] &gt;&gt; he says h it is okay. I'll say it was
[19:01] something from a throne to a
[19:04] &gt;&gt; sle.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Now when he took the move from the
[19:10] throne
[19:12] &gt;&gt; and then he walked to his throne.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:16] That's when he walked to brother
[19:23] &gt;&gt; his third
[19:25] [Music]
[19:33] [Music]
[19:34] &gt;&gt; brother.
[19:35] [Music]
[19:43] Hallelujah. So now we are here to hear
[19:47] the voice
[19:50] [Music]
[19:53] in the bride.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; So if you want to know anything, you
[19:57] must
[20:02] [Applause]
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; We don't only just preach the word, we
[20:09] are the word.
[20:12] [Music]
[20:13] Thank you, Lord.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; Now, here we are.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; Now, we see this. Now, John was supposed
[20:18] to see the one he was supposed to
[20:21] introduce.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Bren was supposed to see the one
[20:27] &gt;&gt; he was supposed to introduce.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; And now we see that this seven seal book
[20:34] is a mystery of redemption. It's a book
[20:37] of redemption from God. Yeah.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; All the mysteries at this time should be
[20:43] finished at the sounding of this of this
[20:47] messenger.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; There he is. The angel on earth
[20:52] &gt;&gt; and another angel mighty messenger came
[20:56] down. That is Revelation 10.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; This angel was an earthly angel
[21:01] messenger.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; But here comes one down from heaven.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[21:08] with a rainbow covenant.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; So, a rainbow covenant.

[28:33] some people are saying that they know
[28:35] the the seals because the first is a
[28:38] white horse.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Now they talking about the symbol.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Re the revelation. Revelation is the
[28:48] word in make flesh.

[29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[29:40] [Music]
[29:41] Christ in the Bible makes the Bible
[29:44] revelation
[29:47] &gt;&gt; because they say what makes heaven

[29:55] &gt;&gt; Christ in you makes him the center of
[29:58] life of the revelation. Yeah. Amen.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Now h
[30:03] &gt;&gt; if I'm saying Christ
[30:08] is just a way
[30:10] &gt;&gt; but now it makes him a revelation only
[30:14] when he is in you

[31:19] prophet says life is in the third.

[31:24] Amen.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; And you are the set throne of God.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; The only way you know him, that's when

[31:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[33:30] members in the church. Is it a pastor?

[33:38] but what I I said even this morning I
[33:42] said to my fellow brother here that
[33:45] what is greater is not the quantity
[33:49] &gt;&gt; it is what is in the heart
[33:56] &gt;&gt; this church of God here or this part of
