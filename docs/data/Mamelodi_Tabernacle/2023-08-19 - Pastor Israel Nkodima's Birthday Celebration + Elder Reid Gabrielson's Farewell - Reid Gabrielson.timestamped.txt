[39:05] amen
[39:07] pasta no no amen that's included to you

[39:15] so
[39:18] since this is a very up class which is
[39:22] like a university class I'm not to say a
[39:25] lot of things
[39:26] [Music]
[39:29] foreign
[39:36] and it says it reads
[39:39] and the energy of the roads began to
[39:41] feel saying
[39:43] allies and go towards the South and do
[39:46] the way of because
[39:47] down to Jerusalem into Gaza which is the
[39:51] desert
[39:52] I don't want to explain about the
[39:54] setting because I
[39:56] I'm here for almost five minutes so for
[39:59] me to say it it is in the Gaza in the
[40:01] desert it will take me a long time but
[40:03] I'll just say that it wasn't it is it
[40:05] and he allows and went and devote a man
[40:09] a utopian
[40:11] that means he was a Nubian
[40:13] that means he was from the continent
[40:15] which he could love most
[40:17] amen
[40:19] and a eunuch of great Authority
[40:23] he was of great Authority and Candace
[40:28] the queen of the Ethiopians who was in
[40:32] charge of all her treasure what come to
[40:34] Jerusalem to worship was returning and
[40:37] sitting in his chariot
[40:38] reading the book of Isaiah's the prophet
[40:41] then the speech said to Philip begonia
[40:44] and joined thyself to the child and Phil
[40:47] blame neither to him and hate him be to
[40:51] the prophet Isaiah and said understand
[40:53] about what it is
[40:56] I are you understanding the what you are
[40:59] reading
[41:00] he said how can I understand except a
[41:03] man
[41:04] in me
[41:06] and he doesn't feel that he should come
[41:08] up and sit with him
[41:11] Hallelujah
[41:16] he was spoken away all the time
[41:20] but he still needed a man
[41:22] to guide him through the spoken word
[41:26] amen actually this scripture is very
[41:29] good I can go through so many things
[41:30] which are the scriptures which uh
[41:33] uh Paul
[41:35] being
[41:37] very well visited in the law
[41:40] but still needing ananias
[41:44] yeah
[41:45] Paul went to aranesque to tell him what
[41:49] he has been leading through the law you
[41:51] know what um closed uh
[41:55] post teaching was
[41:58] okay I'll tell you something
[42:01] maybe I've never heard it
[42:03] this was Paul's teaching
[42:05] Paul's teaching was to take the scroll
[42:07] and take a needle pass through the
[42:10] scroll
[42:11] and try to structurally challenging each
[42:12] other
[42:13] which scriptures have been pierced by
[42:16] that needle
[42:18] which quotations by that name so they
[42:21] will be saying oh if that needle is
[42:23] there that means it is this it is that
[42:25] it is that it is that is that that he
[42:28] knew all that but when they came to this
[42:30] light
[42:33] somebody and then he has to tell you no
[42:36] it's not just about knowing
[42:39] where the scripture is description this
[42:42] is hallelujah so
[42:45] um wordpressing my pastor
[42:48] Hallelujah for me Pastor kodima has been
[42:52] such that we I knew these quotations
[42:55] but you press them where they are
[42:56] supposed to be I think they're the man
[42:58] to tell me this quotation supposed to be
[43:01] there I'm supposed to be there it's not
[43:03] just about knowing it's about putting
[43:05] them in their right places
[43:12] Ethiopian needed Hallelujah so
[43:16] um God bless you my pastor
[43:18] I've learned a lot amen as for me I'm
[43:22] not speaking for you I'm speaking for
[43:24] myself for the other pastors we have
[43:27] benefited from my lord for my own
[43:29] presence
[43:30] [Music]
[43:33] not only
[43:36] that for some of us even physical
[43:38] when
[43:40] I remember when I broke my leg
[43:46] something happened
[43:48] one day
[43:50] we're just like seven days before the
[43:53] meetings in Malawi and my my wife was
[43:56] almost dying
[43:59] um
[44:02] please tell the pastor that we are in
[44:04] trouble here and actually when the
[44:07] meetings were starting on Friday my wife
[44:09] was there saving the pastor praise the
[44:11] Lord
[44:13] so we thank God for the gifts
[44:17] which school has given us
[44:19] you know the importance of a man cannot
[44:22] be over
[44:24] emphasized when God wanted you to have a
[44:28] wife
[44:28] to give you a man which is a woman to be
[44:32] a wife when God wants you to be born he
[44:35] gave you a gift
[44:38] a man for you to be born
[44:42] when God wanted you to do educated what
[44:44] did he give him
[44:45] a man for you to be educated
[44:49] when you are sick when God wanted to
[44:51] hear you what did he do
[44:54] amen amen hallelujah
[44:57] [Music]
[44:58] so when you went to University when you
[45:01] wanted to get your degree what did God
[45:02] God give you
[45:11] your mother teaches you ABCD and then
[45:14] you just turn for your father to tell
[45:16] you ABCD now it is time for the teacher
[45:19] to tell you everything he didn't say
[45:21] it's time for the prophet to tell you
[45:23] ABCD anyway but it continues on until
[45:27] today that where we are we need somebody
[45:29] to guide us this is the way
[45:32] hallelujah what place are we praise the
[45:36] name of the Lord for giving us a man
[45:39] who has stood with us all these seasons
[45:43] [Music]
[45:45] I'll just tell my own story
[45:47] I met Western kodima when I was only 23
[45:50] years old he was very far because he was
[45:53] standing in front and I was at the back
[45:55] Hallelujah he never even knew I existed
[45:59] so
[46:01] years passed by
[46:04] um
[46:05] that was 1990 and in 1998.
[46:10] mostly it was mostly in the wrong way
[46:12] but about 2006 or seven that's when he
[46:17] came to blunder where now I had grown to
[46:19] a position of a deacon so the person
[46:23] says
[46:23] when the pastor comes you'll be the one
[46:25] driving him
[46:27] you remember Master yeah also I was the
[46:30] one driving him that time
[46:33] um I was very close but not too close to
[46:35] a point which I could see what to say on
[46:37] the other side yeah so I was driving
[46:40] past around uh we took just just like
[46:44] somebody to talk to his driver that was
[46:47] all but when it came to 2014
[46:50] uh when I was a minister now full time
[46:53] minister
[46:55] um
[46:55] then something happened
[47:00] something happened which
[47:03] my brother
[47:05] said it yesterday but I didn't tell him
[47:06] that it happened to me that same way
[47:10] something happened which which you said
[47:12] yesterday
[47:14] I said
[47:15] I have seen that Pastor odima has got
[47:19] suffer that's what he told me yesterday
[47:26] so that's why I studied following
[47:28] Hallelujah so
[47:32] from there onwards it has been a
[47:34] different issue because now
[47:36] [Music]
[47:37] um
[47:39] those who stay closed they see
[47:43] as much as those that see much more than
[47:47] those who are
[47:48] far off those of us have stood closer to
[47:52] pastor podima we have seen nothing but
[47:55] the hand of God hallelujah amen for all
[48:00] these years we've been moving together
[48:02] he's our device to us
[48:05] his uh challenges uh his challenges to
[48:08] us
[48:10] uh
[48:12] actually uh can I say one two one more
[48:16] thing
[48:19] I'll say but uh please just do not
[48:24] take over it overboard
[48:28] amen
[48:37] for me
[48:39] it has come to a point to it
[48:41] even if I want to do a business
[48:48] [Music]
[48:52] [Applause]
[48:55] am I not a pastor so what should I was
[48:58] that another pastor
[49:00] like pasta I want to do this business
[49:03] there was another what business which I
[49:05] wanted to do
[49:06] he told me you are a pastor do this
[49:09] business
[49:12] [Music]
[49:14] [Applause]
[49:17] I was a little bit disappointed when I
[49:19] was coming back
[49:23] but what's the use of consultation if
[49:25] you cannot follow the leadership
[49:30] master I want to do this I will not say
[49:33] it because I don't want you to get
[49:35] hallucinating I think
[49:40] he said he said no my brother
[49:43] you are a pastor you can't do a business
[49:47] with
[49:48] more than 50 percent of your time
[49:50] that means the other side of your work
[49:53] will suffer
[49:57] amen so uh these are the issues which we
[50:01] when we speak about leadership and
[50:03] guidance uh the pastor is not just there
[50:06] to marry you and bury you is also there
[50:09] to be
[50:10] actually there to tell you exactly but
[50:13] even what type of business you want to
[50:15] go into and we thank God for that amen
[50:19] so the other business is the one who
[50:22] told me to do how to do it
[50:24] [Music]

[1:16:17] every time we introduce him
[1:16:20] [Music]
[1:16:26] [Music]
[1:16:29] from that time
[1:16:31] when we we see the way the Lord has been
[1:16:35] using him
[1:16:40] to approach scriptures
[1:16:45] to handle the the the the the
[1:16:48] supernatural presence
[1:16:58] foreign foreign
[1:17:17] [Music]
[1:17:59] and we know we can't we we can't put

[1:18:43] foreign
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:43] just coming from the trip in KitchenAid
[1:19:56] to speak about these things
[1:19:59] please next time you must never forget
[1:20:01] to invite me
[1:20:12] so God bless you so I was just saying
[1:20:17] our last trip in yeah
[1:20:21] it was another special one
[1:20:25] like many others
[1:20:39] I I don't even know where to start
[1:20:42] but things went so well
[1:20:46] like God was putting everything in place
[1:20:52] a few days
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:08] because when they they welcome Us in
[1:21:12] that manner
[1:21:14] I think before I leave I told them
[1:21:17] brothers
[1:21:19] please when you come to us
[1:21:23] please don't expect we can do this
[1:21:37] so when I arrive I think Pastor Freddie
[1:21:41] and them were already there
[1:21:44] at the airport
[1:21:48] and it was very well
[1:21:52] so they charged me to preach all the
[1:21:55] same ones
[1:21:57] since I did not have pastor kodima with
[1:22:00] me
[1:22:04] it was very tiring
[1:22:06] I was praying until they arrived
[1:22:10] so I told the brothers
[1:22:16] my pastor arrived Africa you know that
[1:22:20] one is my father
[1:22:21] so I don't want him to work
[1:22:25] from the airplane to uh
[1:22:29] foreign
[1:22:31] [Music]
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:31] so they they definitely
[1:23:35] yes
[1:23:44] [Applause]
[1:23:48] [Music]
[1:23:52] they sent a car there but he said no you
[1:23:55] must you must then be in that car
[1:23:59] because we can't allow the car to go
[1:24:01] there
[1:24:08] I had to make it as a sign that God is
[1:24:11] giving us a place
[1:24:17] when you go to a place just
[1:25:00] thank you foreign
[1:25:06] [Music]
[1:25:39] um
[1:25:40] a gift operates by a true happiness
[1:25:48] so it means if you want the gift to
[1:25:50] operate
[1:25:53] you must make the person happy
[1:26:00] that's why the prophet says
[1:26:17] we'll make the gifts
[1:26:23] and I think many people getting Among Us
[1:26:26] don't pick that chance
[1:26:32] that a gift does not just do Miracles
[1:26:45] who makes the gifts
[1:27:00] because it's like the pastors
[1:27:21] for the introductions
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:30] and when I was waiting the
[1:27:33] thank you
[1:27:35] multiple videos the manifestation of the
[1:27:37] spirit
[1:27:41] ual
[1:27:45] prophesying
[1:27:47] and I knew that
[1:27:50] I don't want to take too much
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:56] we need really to appreciate
[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:04] the man God has given unto us
[1:28:08] yes
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:28] the blessings
[1:28:40] to Jesus
[1:28:49] and that makes the ministry of Jesus
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:23] if you start doubting and fighting
[1:29:32] foreign
[1:29:39] [Music]
[1:29:49] [Applause]
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:03] [Applause]
[1:30:08] I don't know
[1:30:12] foreign
[1:30:37] [Laughter]
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:31:03] okay yes
[1:31:05] I am representing
[1:31:09] the the premiers of the church the
[1:31:14] elders chicken board and the trustee
[1:31:17] board
[1:31:18] in that case that includes the church as
[1:31:21] the whole
[1:31:23] so I'm speaking on behalf of the church
[1:31:30] when problemacetic sent me a message
[1:31:34] this morning said you're going to speak
[1:31:37] on behalf of the elders
[1:31:40] now to speak about the pastor
[1:31:44] it's a very it's a challenge yeah
[1:31:50] I can't speak about the pasta on my
[1:31:53] personal capacity
[1:31:55] how I know him when did I know him
[1:31:59] how he groomed me
[1:32:02] now that will be a personal one but now
[1:32:05] if I have to speak on behalf of the
[1:32:07] church
[1:32:09] I just decided to
[1:32:12] the only person that knows the pastor is
[1:32:15] God
[1:32:15] or he himself must come and speak about
[1:32:18] him so
[1:32:22] then God sent me to brother Brandon and
[1:32:25] said no
[1:32:26] brother Brennan knows him let him go let
[1:32:29] him come and speak about him brother
[1:32:32] Brendan said no Paul knows him yeah so I
[1:32:36] decided no I'm not going to say a thing
[1:32:39] it's just chocolate brother Branham says
[1:32:42] and what Paul says
[1:32:45] that will be the church
[1:32:50] as Pastor David said
[1:32:54] some of us are very notorious
[1:32:58] for the longevity of our speeches
[1:33:02] but we are
[1:33:05] we are very long and I don't be
[1:33:07] surprised by these papers we just want
[1:33:09] to read what Paul says
[1:33:12] amen
[1:33:19] [Applause]
[1:33:25] start by saying
[1:33:28] the pasta is a special person
[1:33:32] now what can you say if they say someone
[1:33:35] is a special person and who are you
[1:33:40] to speak on behalf of me
[1:33:43] now he says
[1:33:45] he is the highest order of the church
[1:33:48] remember
[1:33:50] so my speeches are are always
[1:33:58] so as the policeman
[1:34:02] model is along the order side
[1:34:05] now it says a pastor is a special person
[1:34:09] uh
[1:34:12] is the highest order in the church yeah
[1:34:14] let's order in the church
[1:34:22] so
[1:34:24] but you see in the church there is a
[1:34:27] pastor the pasta is a special person he
[1:34:31] is built where he can put up with the
[1:34:34] forces of the people
[1:34:37] he's a parent there
[1:34:41] he's an ox of the team
[1:34:44] he's a man that can sit down when
[1:34:47] somebody got something against somebody
[1:34:50] yes and sit down with them too
[1:34:54] families
[1:34:55] and take neither side and reason it out
[1:34:59] and bring it right back into sweetness
[1:35:04] he knows how to take care of things
[1:35:08] now he's describing him not me yeah and
[1:35:12] now the Church of God is there now and
[1:35:15] now the Church of God is the highest of
[1:35:19] judgment remember
[1:35:21] and the pastor is the highest order in
[1:35:25] the church
[1:35:27] the Elder meaning the pastor is the
[1:35:31] highest thing in the apostolic church
[1:35:34] now those who knows what an Apostolic
[1:35:36] church is he says he the Elder is the
[1:35:40] highest thing in the apostolic church
[1:35:43] outside of the Holy Ghost I would say
[1:35:47] holy ghost then comes the past
[1:35:50] the Holy Spirit brings his message
[1:35:52] straight to the Elder
[1:35:55] the Elder give it to the people amen
[1:35:59] now
[1:36:00] Paul said now it's all not describing
[1:36:04] you
[1:36:06] he said not all things
[1:36:09] presently and in order remember we said
[1:36:12] is the highest order in the church
[1:36:16] First Corinthians chapter 1 14
[1:36:19] that's Paul
[1:36:21] first Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 12
[1:36:24] Paul says
[1:36:26] and we beseech you Brethren to know
[1:36:29] them which labor among you
[1:36:32] mean it means we must know him because
[1:36:35] he's neighboring among our house
[1:36:40] who is laboring among you and are over
[1:36:44] you in the Lord
[1:36:47] and admonish you amen right
[1:36:52] verse 13 says and to esteem them very
[1:36:56] highly in the love for their word
[1:37:01] and be at peace among yourselves yes
[1:37:06] it's Paul again in the book of Hebrews
[1:37:09] he says remember them which have they
[1:37:12] rule over you
[1:37:18] remember them which have the rule over
[1:37:20] you
[1:37:21] who have spoken unto the who has who has
[1:37:26] spoken unto you the word of God
[1:37:30] whose Faith follow considering the end
[1:37:33] of their conversation
[1:37:35] verse 17 says obey them
[1:37:39] not have the rule over you
[1:37:42] and submit yourselves
[1:37:45] for they watch for you
[1:37:49] for the word for you so yes now woman
[1:37:53] who am I that I can speak about somebody
[1:37:56] that watch for myself
[1:37:59] as they have
[1:38:01] a day that must give account amen and
[1:38:05] that they may do it with joy and not
[1:38:08] with grief
[1:38:10] for that is unprofitable for you that's
[1:38:13] what Pastor David will say
[1:38:16] then don't worry it's only three pages
[1:38:20] and through America
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:26] then says I'm doing that so that maybe
[1:38:30] some of us might remember who we are and
[1:38:34] who is our pastor the first thing that's
[1:38:37] foreign I wish to say is that the pastor
[1:38:40] is always in full charge of the
[1:38:42] Tabernacle right
[1:38:45] so he is in full charge to change or to
[1:38:49] do what so ever I think is best under
[1:38:52] the leadership of the Holy Ghost yeah
[1:38:55] now that's what he says
[1:39:03] be humble
[1:39:05] don't never get yourself puffed up
[1:39:07] Pastor David mentioned that pop up to
[1:39:11] place where you know more about Eastern
[1:39:13] Europe pasta or the church that you are
[1:39:16] worshiping in yes if you get to that
[1:39:19] place then I will advise each one of you
[1:39:24] to get another place to worship
[1:39:29] then he continues he says
[1:39:34] because I am asking the pastor never to
[1:39:38] permit anything outside of the Bible of
[1:39:41] the Bible order the way we have seen it
[1:39:44] here in the church and then we want
[1:39:46] these gifts that the Pastor David was
[1:39:50] talking about to be operated and in
[1:39:53] peace
[1:39:54] and the worshipers
[1:39:56] carried correctly according to the word
[1:39:58] you'll see a mighty wonderful Church in
[1:40:02] operation
[1:40:04] for our Lord Jesus Christ amen that's
[1:40:07] exactly that was happened that has
[1:40:09] happened in the Jamaican amen
[1:40:12] he also has the right over his dick on
[1:40:16] board so I'm speaking in from here
[1:40:21] you can change the tick on board the
[1:40:24] trustees or the pianists or any other
[1:40:27] office in the church that you decide to
[1:40:30] change feeling led by the Holy Spirit to
[1:40:32] do so
[1:40:36] amen
[1:40:37] it is
[1:40:40] abide in the doctrine of their Church
[1:40:45] it is lawful for them to add or to take
[1:40:49] away of the teachings because they are
[1:40:53] owned
[1:40:54] sorry yes that's right is it lawful for
[1:40:59] them to add or to take away of their
[1:41:02] teachings because of their own personal
[1:41:04] opinion or Revelation that is an answer
[1:41:09] translate should be perfectly in harmony
[1:41:13] with the doctrine of their Church they
[1:41:17] should stay perfectly with the
[1:41:19] interpretation of the scriptures of
[1:41:21] their church because if they don't they
[1:41:24] are fighting against their very thing
[1:41:27] they are hurting themselves
[1:41:29] that's the last picture
[1:41:40] I told you that my speech is on the
[1:41:43] order this idea and then when they
[1:41:45] remember the side maybe some have just
[1:41:48] lost their position
[1:41:50] so there's nothing that I can see about
[1:41:53] the pastor or just read what brother
[1:41:56] Branham says about the pastor and his
[1:41:58] authority
[1:42:01] he says you've got to have faith in him
[1:42:06] and confidence in
[1:42:09] faith and confidence in him
[1:42:14] that's the reason your pastor can't do
[1:42:17] nothing for you
[1:42:19] you've got to have faith in him and
[1:42:22] confidence in him as a man of God
[1:42:27] then he says You must be soldiers
[1:42:30] not fresh recruits
[1:42:33] your age soldiers now and been trained
[1:42:38] to fight that's what he has done he's
[1:42:40] trained us to fight amen and Satan will
[1:42:43] come among you because
[1:42:45] you uh cause you to dispute with one
[1:42:48] another if he can
[1:42:51] turn him down just immediately your
[1:42:54] brethren is the enemy yes and you're
[1:42:57] here to hold a standard in the evening
[1:42:59] light because when the world is darkened
[1:43:03] and the whole church kingdom is going
[1:43:04] into the Council of churches let me not
[1:43:07] go into that one you see that's the last
[1:43:10] one yeah
[1:43:13] and
[1:43:15] stay with your mother
[1:43:18] so he's the shepherd
[1:43:21] and you give him respect
[1:43:25] he will lead you
[1:43:29] because his ordained of God to do so
[1:43:34] [Music]
[1:43:36] he will take you the rest of the way
[1:43:40] through the sentences amen carried you
[1:43:43] safely
[1:43:44] is far with God he will take you the
[1:43:47] rest of the world if he has taken you
[1:43:50] this far then he will take you through
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:44:10] um
[1:44:10] yeah
[1:44:17] yeah that was my speech
[1:44:22] [Applause]
[1:44:27] Hallelujah see that's why
[1:44:32] God bless you amen
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:39] before we call the pasta
[1:44:43] to give Thanksgiving
[1:44:46] I'm told the pastor
[1:44:49] is also going to unveil another surprise
[1:44:52] for us
[1:44:54] [Music]
[1:44:57] and after the speech of the pastor I
[1:45:01] will unveil another
[1:45:02] event so today we have many surprises
[1:45:07] so before we can call the pastor to come
[1:45:10] through I'm going to call two musical
[1:45:13] items in preparation for the pasta to
[1:45:16] come the reason I'm gonna do that
[1:45:19] [Music]
[1:45:21] is because
[1:45:23] I'm told that there are people that
[1:45:25] brought presents so I'm gonna ask them
[1:45:29] to put them on that table over there
[1:45:36] after the pastor has spoken then we're
[1:45:39] going to have a presentation of the gift
[1:45:43] so I will ask sister maseti and sister
[1:45:46] kanisile
[1:45:47] to render an item before we call the
[1:45:50] pastor so if you left them present in
[1:45:53] the car just be kind to bring it there
[1:45:57] before the pasta
[1:45:59] can give a Thanksgiving message
[1:46:05] sister livo

[1:46:10] heart just be a lady

[2:04:13] so the family and the elders were
[2:04:16] reminding me
[2:04:18] that there is something special to make
[2:04:21] the person happy
[2:04:25] so I'm going to ask the pastor to come
[2:04:28] and stand here and
[2:04:31] oh they prefer the pastor to stand on my
[2:04:35] right
[2:04:36] and there is a special gift that the
[2:04:38] pastor is going to receive from our
[2:04:42] elderly
[2:04:45] and thereafter I would also just ask
[2:04:48] Pastor kuchingari is a special gift for
[2:04:51] you amen still have more gifts but they
[2:04:54] will have us
[2:04:56] so we just want to make money

[2:08:12] [Music]
[2:08:30] good morning
[2:08:32] [Music]
[2:08:34] unless I say God bless you brother first
[2:08:36] of all I was very thankful that I could
[2:08:39] be here for your birthday
[2:08:41] these gifts I could have just set them
[2:08:44] out but you wouldn't understand what
[2:08:46] they were about
[2:08:48] because part of what I brought I wanted
[2:08:51] to represent where I live so I had to
[2:08:54] bring certain things with me and put it
[2:08:57] together when I got here so I'll have to
[2:09:00] explain what it is okay uh and what
[2:09:03] whenever I talk to brother Matthew
[2:09:06] I think it was in May uh I told him that
[2:09:10] I wanted to come in August and he said
[2:09:12] well he said okay we'll look for you
[2:09:14] August the 3rd so I thought okay well
[2:09:16] I've already got a time to start with
[2:09:18] and then he said it would be nice if you
[2:09:21] could stay through Saturday the 12th
[2:09:23] because it's our pastor's birthday so I
[2:09:25] said fine I'll make my return right
[2:09:28] after that so
[2:09:30] um so what I did was I have some things
[2:09:33] here that I put together I'll mention to
[2:09:36] you that when I came to the airport
[2:09:40] uh I was greeted very nicely
[2:09:44] and a little sister by the name of
[2:09:47] little Tina is it Go Tina
[2:09:50] okay I'm sorry I get the name kind of
[2:09:53] yeah so anyway she gave me the little
[2:09:55] book of poems that she had
[2:09:58] and I have been reading through those
[2:10:00] since I've been here I have a little bit
[2:10:02] farther to go but when I left my home I
[2:10:07] got more of what I needed than just to
[2:10:10] make one
[2:10:11] so I actually made two and I have one of
[2:10:15] them in this bag here and whenever you
[2:10:17] get a chance you can give it to her I
[2:10:19] don't know if she's here or not but I
[2:10:21] wanted to see that she gets it and I'm
[2:10:23] going to kind of explain what it is uh
[2:10:26] as I present this to you I've got a
[2:10:29] couple things in this bag so I'm going
[2:10:30] to give you one thing that's totally
[2:10:32] unrelated to at first
[2:10:34] and then I have another item that I'll
[2:10:36] give it to you afterwards that's what's
[2:10:37] in this blue package here okay so um
[2:10:41] besides the card I got you which you can
[2:10:44] read when you get a chance
[2:10:47] this is this is probably this is
[2:10:49] probably something that I don't know if
[2:10:51] you'll have a lot of use for these uh we
[2:10:54] use them in the U.S all the time uh but
[2:10:57] but you can open it it's not really
[2:10:58] wrapped in gift paper but go ahead and
[2:11:01] if you want to just unwrap the paper off
[2:11:04] of it and you'll see whether I can
[2:11:05] unwrap it for you yeah
[2:11:09] chill open enough to show you what it is
[2:11:17] what those are is those are our coasters
[2:11:21] that you can set a glass on okay and I
[2:11:25] notice here in this country you don't
[2:11:27] use a lot of ice you don't use any eyes
[2:11:29] actually most of the time but we use ice
[2:11:32] generally for our drinks so if you have
[2:11:34] a drink with ice in it and you're
[2:11:35] setting on a glass table then you get
[2:11:37] water all over the table and everything
[2:11:38] and sometimes if we have a hot coffee or
[2:11:41] something we'll set it
[2:11:44] [Applause]
[2:11:47] [Music]
[2:11:48] and I thought about you because you're
[2:11:51] always talking about the lighthouse
[2:11:52] about the light and how there's two
[2:11:54] different lights
[2:11:57] that's not the main thing but that's one
[2:11:59] of the things
[2:12:02] foreign
[2:12:11] I'm going to try to keep it intact okay
[2:12:15] and I'm going to set it I'm going to set
[2:12:16] it right here and then I will go into it
[2:12:19] in more detail okay
[2:12:21] so what I did was let me see if I can
[2:12:25] get this here
[2:12:26] [Music]
[2:12:28] what I did was I thought what can I
[2:12:31] bring I'm sorry I thought what can what
[2:12:33] can I bring that will be represented of
[2:12:36] my area that I live in so
[2:12:39] I thought well we have we have some of
[2:12:42] the whitest beaches around where are
[2:12:44] there there are some places where you'll
[2:12:46] find white sand but not very many but
[2:12:48] the area in which I live has very white
[2:12:51] sand
[2:12:52] and so I got some white sand I got more
[2:12:55] than I needed I didn't know why I was
[2:12:56] bringing so much more than I needed but
[2:12:58] now I do because I made two
[2:13:00] I got some white sand and then I got
[2:13:03] some little shells that are kind of like
[2:13:05] little clam shells here those wash up on
[2:13:08] the shore so they're they're usually we
[2:13:10] don't dig for these little things here
[2:13:12] they just sort of wash it but those are
[2:13:13] little shells we would find on our shore
[2:13:15] and then the other thing I got is a sand
[2:13:18] dollar
[2:13:19] and I don't know if you've ever seen a
[2:13:21] sand dollar before can you hold this
[2:13:22] with you
[2:13:30] [Music]
[2:13:31] some people might be familiar with this
[2:13:34] it's called a sand dollar and they're
[2:13:37] located in different places uh different
[2:13:39] areas where they have emotions sometimes
[2:13:42] they'll have sand dollars you don't
[2:13:43] usually see these on the beach until
[2:13:45] they washed up on the beach okay they've
[2:13:47] either they're a living organism but if
[2:13:50] they die then they wash up they're on
[2:13:52] they're on the on the sand or whatever
[2:13:55] and then the sun bleaches them out and
[2:13:57] that's why they look quite like this
[2:13:59] okay well there's a little legend about
[2:14:02] this and that is that the sand dollar
[2:14:06] depicts the life and death of Jesus
[2:14:09] Christ in it
[2:14:10] because let me let me get this right
[2:14:14] here
[2:14:19] I will read it to you and then you can
[2:14:22] look at this and and see it maybe like
[2:14:24] hold on
[2:14:25] so in the sand dollar
[2:14:28] uh it's I'm going to read this it says
[2:14:30] the legend Grand is told about the life
[2:14:33] of Jesus throughout this odd shaped
[2:14:35] seashell
[2:14:36] if you view it from the top as seen
[2:14:39] above right here if you do it from the
[2:14:40] top the center plainly shows The Guiding
[2:14:45] star that led the wise men to Bethlehem
[2:14:47] and that's right in the very center so
[2:14:49] you have to sometimes you have to look
[2:14:50] pretty close to see it okay
[2:14:52] uh and also on the top is the Easter
[2:14:57] lily so the there's there's five little
[2:15:00] projections here that look just like an
[2:15:02] Easter Lily and an Easter lily
[2:15:06] I got I got a picture of one there's a
[2:15:09] little streak up through the middle of
[2:15:11] it and then there's like leaves on
[2:15:12] either side of it so it's got three
[2:15:14] three areas in it and this this little
[2:15:17] um
[2:15:18] this little uh sand dollar has that on
[2:15:21] it okay the other thing of the sand
[2:15:23] dollar is they say it depicts the
[2:15:26] crucifixion of Jesus Christ because you
[2:15:30] have two Nails where the nailed in his
[2:15:33] hands to the Cross down here you have
[2:15:35] two Nails where they nailed his feet to
[2:15:37] the cross and right in the middle is the
[2:15:40] spear that they appears to side with
[2:15:42] when he died and so that's why they say
[2:15:44] that's what those little holes represent
[2:15:46] on the back side of this it's also
[2:15:50] depicting a plant and it's called a
[2:15:53] poinsettia we see poinsettias in our
[2:15:56] country usually around Christmas time so
[2:15:58] it's generally a time when everybody
[2:16:00] acknowledges the birth of Jesus and so
[2:16:03] forth we know that he wasn't born in the
[2:16:05] winter if it was winter time or whatever
[2:16:07] but anyway that's what's on the back so
[2:16:10] all those things are on this little sand
[2:16:11] dollar
[2:16:12] now when I was getting ready to put
[2:16:15] these together because I was going to
[2:16:17] make two of them
[2:16:18] I had this right here in a package with
[2:16:23] one sandal
[2:16:25] and there was a little clear package and
[2:16:28] then I got another sand dollar that was
[2:16:30] the same size thinking I was going to
[2:16:32] put that one in your jar and then give
[2:16:34] you this in a package the one I decided
[2:16:36] to do two I took the sand dollar out of
[2:16:38] this put it in your jar and I put the
[2:16:40] other one in herger okay now
[2:16:44] uh one thing a video since I only had
[2:16:47] one of these I knew I was going to have
[2:16:49] to reproduce and make two because I
[2:16:51] wanted one for the other one
[2:16:52] so I thought okay I need to find a place
[2:16:55] where I can have this copied so I went
[2:16:57] to a place called PostNet which is where
[2:17:00] they do that sort of thing and I took
[2:17:02] this in now I want to ask you what color
[2:17:04] if you're looking at that can anybody
[2:17:06] tell me what color that looks like can
[2:17:08] you tell me what color would you say
[2:17:09] that is
[2:17:10] I mean is it a green I'm flying color
[2:17:13] yeah I'm color blind blue green can we
[2:17:16] get a good look at it okay magenta green
[2:17:18] but this but it seems to me it's almost
[2:17:20] like a blue green
[2:17:22] I would think because you're seeing the
[2:17:24] color on it it's a green but it's kind
[2:17:25] of like a blue green so I took it in and
[2:17:28] uh to have it copied and when they
[2:17:30] copied it
[2:17:32] it came out like this in the copy
[2:17:35] machine okay it came out like that that
[2:17:38] color of green now that's very
[2:17:40] significant here because that color
[2:17:43] would be more like an emerald color
[2:17:45] wouldn't you say more of a green that
[2:17:47] would look like kind of like an emerald
[2:17:48] the place where I live on along that
[2:17:51] Coast right in that area is called the
[2:17:53] Emerald Coast
[2:17:55] so that the camera of course is a green
[2:17:57] color and the reason that they call it
[2:18:00] the Emerald Coast is the water stair or
[2:18:02] the same color as that dream so when I
[2:18:05] had it reproduced it came out with this
[2:18:07] color green that represents the waters
[2:18:10] that these things would be in so I
[2:18:12] copied it off and I put one in each jar
[2:18:14] one layers and one so I just want you
[2:18:18] know it's not uh it's nothing flashy but
[2:18:21] it's something that just represents I
[2:18:24] wanted to bring that to you
[2:18:29] the other item I have here let me put
[2:18:32] this in the back
[2:18:34] here's a card here too but I'll just let
[2:18:36] you open the card later okay I'll just
[2:18:39] save the card there
[2:18:41] um this item here now
[2:18:44] let me say something about this
[2:18:47] this is something that this is something
[2:18:50] that I was given by another brother to
[2:18:53] bring here
[2:18:54] uh to show you okay and uh he was very
[2:18:59] generous so let me do that and he said
[2:19:01] now after I started on my trip he said I
[2:19:05] want you to have the power to give that
[2:19:08] as a gift if you wish to do it and he
[2:19:10] said you can say that's between you and
[2:19:12] me from you and me this brother's name
[2:19:15] is Bruce Haskins and I fellowship with
[2:19:18] him quite often he's a brother that I
[2:19:19] happen to love very much and uh so he
[2:19:23] gave me this to bring so I am giving
[2:19:25] this to you
[2:19:27] um I need something to cut the tape I
[2:19:30] put tape on the end so I'll help to open
[2:19:32] it
[2:19:35] just anything it doesn't have to be real
[2:19:38] sharp because I need to open it up and
[2:19:41] show it to you
[2:19:46] um let me know
[2:19:53] I thought this might be the only one of
[2:19:55] these in South Africa but I found out I
[2:19:58] was wrong
[2:20:02] let me see if I can get it out of here
[2:20:05] this is the original
[2:20:10] 1963
[2:20:12] copy of when the prophet makes it the
[2:20:15] cloud you don't remember the company
[2:20:17] well this brother and his brother had
[2:20:20] this magazine I never had even seen it I
[2:20:22] heard about it and I saw the cover at
[2:20:25] one time somewhere I had never even read
[2:20:27] the the article in it but I read it on
[2:20:30] this trip okay so uh it depicts the
[2:20:34] times there's a lot in there that's
[2:20:36] probably undesirable to look at but um
[2:20:40] but it does show the cloud and it shows
[2:20:42] on the other side of the page they
[2:20:45] called it a moon moon beam
[2:20:48] it's a rainbow I think it is you may
[2:20:51] know this I don't know if you've ever
[2:20:52] seen this or not but I found out that
[2:20:54] brother uh is it to ship to shampoo okay
[2:20:58] okay he had come to find out as I was
[2:21:01] talking to the jfm oh I guess I'm not
[2:21:03] bringing the only one apparently he went
[2:21:06] to a meeting somewhere or put to some
[2:21:08] place wherever you had meetings and a
[2:21:10] brother there he was looking at that and
[2:21:12] he admired that you know that that he
[2:21:14] had that copy and he said we even had
[2:21:16] taken so apparently he has this copy
[2:21:18] here I didn't know that I mean because
[2:21:20] because most people in the US don't have
[2:21:23] this coffee I didn't have it and this
[2:21:25] one brother had it so I just want you
[2:21:26] know we just wanted to give that to you
[2:21:28] oh my you know just as a coffee because
[2:21:30] the profit mentions this and it's just
[2:21:32] representative what he thought
[2:21:37] thank you
[2:21:41] I've been a real honor to be able to not
[2:21:45] only know you but to also be able to be
[2:21:48] part of this ministry and streaming it's
[2:21:51] been very very much a blessing to myself
[2:21:54] and also brother Brothers
[2:21:55] [Music]
[2:21:57] [Applause]
[2:22:02] [Music]
[2:22:12] [Music]
[2:22:12] um
[2:22:18] [Music]
[2:22:23] God bless you sense
[2:22:26] I didn't know that the gifts giving of
[2:22:28] this this elaborate otherwise I don't
[2:22:32] that much something much better than
[2:22:33] what I've done
[2:22:39] um
[2:22:40] okay well one day I don't know whether
[2:22:42] it's a year yeah it should be last year
[2:22:45] um I was passing through the
[2:22:53] much
[2:22:54] so I saw something there
[2:22:58] no I should buy that thing but I should
[2:23:00] go to apply for the pasta
[2:23:02] so on this trip I never prepared
[2:23:04] actually I was sending message on Monday
[2:23:06] but on Sunday or Monday over the weekend
[2:23:09] yeah I should come here uh I haven't I
[2:23:13] hadn't been home at all so I was
[2:23:16] required to come back to come here so
[2:23:18] that means that I didn't have time to
[2:23:20] prepare I wish they told me I have to
[2:23:22] beat the boss that I'll be here so maybe
[2:23:24] end up taking something from the Exotic
[2:23:27] lands to come with it
[2:23:29] but unfortunately I didn't know so when
[2:23:32] I was called that because I was
[2:23:33] empty-handed but when I came back I came
[2:23:36] here I said no
[2:23:37] one day I saw something which I said ah
[2:23:40] this one
[2:23:41] I want to get for my pastor so today I
[2:23:44] went and ran and uh to get it so that I
[2:23:48] can give it to my pastor but it is
[2:23:49] something which I thought long time ago
[2:23:51] that uh one day I'll buy this thing for
[2:23:53] my pasta Mommy
[2:24:00] [Applause]
[2:24:08] [Music]
[2:24:19] okay
[2:24:19] [Music]
[2:24:28] there's something which we do a lot with
[2:24:30] my master and that's a drinking tea
[2:24:35] we drink a lot of tea
[2:24:37] [Music]
[2:24:39] and coffee yeah so now um
[2:24:44] [Music]
[2:24:47] but they say this one can keep your tea
[2:24:50] warm for 24 hours
[2:24:56] [Applause]
[2:25:02] you can make your tea here and you can
[2:25:04] drink until the next day yes
[2:25:07] [Music]
[2:25:14] I wish I love them that are the thing I
[2:25:16] knew that their business would be this
[2:25:21] [Music]
[2:25:31] all right so
[2:25:34] yes I'm continuing
[2:25:38] we as the board
[2:25:42] and we're scheduled
[2:25:46] yes
[2:25:48] [Music]
[2:25:54] thank you
[2:25:55] love it I mean so um
[2:25:58] I was saying pastor that is the our team
[2:26:05] seeing a new schedule
[2:26:08] how the demand is
[2:26:15] we've realized that you would like to
[2:26:17] pack
[2:26:18] your things in order
[2:26:20] [Music]
[2:26:22] remain behind yes so we thought of
[2:26:25] getting something that you can if when
[2:26:29] you fly they can put it in the cabin so
[2:26:33] that your spoken whether those are to
[2:26:35] you if you think of something I thought
[2:26:37] you can just say myself to bring me that
[2:26:39] spoken word I want to check something
[2:26:42] so it's just a a truly travel deck type
[2:26:46] that you can use handy and it's also got
[2:26:51] what you call the thing that you pull
[2:26:53] out and you can also use that because
[2:26:56] you know when you travel long distances
[2:26:57] there's things like jet lag and all
[2:27:00] those things so if you feel cramps you
[2:27:02] can lean on it as you travel so this is
[2:27:05] the thing the story that we have
[2:27:09] come on
[2:27:17] baby
[2:27:23] [Applause]
[2:27:38] [Music]
[2:27:44] you
[2:27:46] [Music]
[2:27:51] you want two gifts it's a special one
[2:27:54] that is
[2:27:59] so I think that one if I'm right person
[2:28:02] is for the pastor
[2:28:04] so we I think there's going to be an
[2:28:08] exchange
[2:28:09] you know when you travel you find
[2:28:13] adapters that says from U.S to South
[2:28:16] Africa
[2:28:18] another one that says from South Africa
[2:28:19] to us so there's going to be an exchange
[2:28:22] from the pasta too
[2:28:32] that we gave you
[2:28:34] sent to your visiting
[2:28:39] [Applause]
[2:28:51] God bless you
[2:28:54] yeah
[2:28:57] we want to give you an opportunity to
[2:29:00] say a few words
[2:29:01] and after there will be more
[2:29:04] presentations of the gifts
