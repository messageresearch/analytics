[8:55] Generation
[8:55] [Music]
[8:58] generation
[9:03] [Music]
[9:15] okay and let's turn also to the Book of
[9:19] John chapter 14
[9:28] verse1 verse one
[9:47] [Music]
[9:51] ver okay uh is that
[9:54] the one yes it is the verse one The Book
[9:59] of John John 14
[10:05] verse1 okay if you can continue to verse
[10:09] two
[10:24] [Music]
[10:28] brother
[10:35] [Music]
[10:38] and and and lastly verse three and
[10:53] [Music]
[10:58] four
[11:01] three and four okay uh you may be seated
[11:05] God bless
[11:10] you H just for few minutes the Lord
[11:18] willing is just to look at
[11:21] our
[11:27] pleases as we read in the Book of
[11:34] Psalms uh uh I think we read that in
[11:40] [Music]
[11:42] English Lord thou has been our Dwelling
[11:49] Place in all
[11:52] generations our Dwelling Place in all
[11:57] generations
[12:02] now each and
[12:05] every person as as a
[12:09] human want must have a
[12:18] place and
[12:20] because we have seen even in the animal
[12:24] world
[12:26] that everything whether it's men or
[12:29] animal it is strong in its
[12:38] place amen
[12:40] amen so even we Christians each and
[12:46] every one of us is strong in his
[12:57] place
[13:00] that's why in worshiping we make sure
[13:02] that we find the right
[13:10] place because there are so many places
[13:15] tonight where people go for to
[13:21] worship but among all the
[13:26] places one has to find his
[13:32] [Music]
[13:35] place and as we will look in the
[13:42] Bible I used to go with a certain
[13:45] brother for hunting he's a
[13:51] hunter and I saw that the the animals
[13:55] are strong in their places
[14:06] then I to the Bible and I realize that
[14:10] man also is strong in his
[14:20] place we don't you don't just become a
[14:23] Christian but you become a placed
[14:27] Christian
[14:33] and I want to
[14:38] read in this book Fellowship by
[14:47] Redemption to John
[14:52] 14 now he
[14:55] says I have never believed that heaven
[14:58] was a place where there is a a bunch of
[15:07] buildings where there is a bunch of
[15:12] houses made with
[15:18] M now he's referring to where Jesus says
[15:24] I'm going to prepare you to prepare a
[15:26] place for you
[15:33] and brother b as you have read you know
[15:36] this uh part here he is showing us uh
[15:42] what kind of a place the Lord was
[15:54] talking and uh he's going to show that
[15:59] if you have a place in heaven then you
[16:03] have a place here in the body of
[16:13] Christ because the prophet says before
[16:16] God can show something on Earth he shows
[16:19] it in
[16:26] heaven because when he he God wanted to
[16:30] reflect to be
[16:37] reflected now when he made a man he made
[16:41] a man so that men can
[16:49] reflect as he says in the book count
[16:56] down count down
[17:01] he
[17:02] says when God created
[17:08] things uh he says that everything on on
[17:11] Earth reflects
[17:17] Heaven because you see that everything
[17:21] is struggling for
[17:25] [Music]
[17:26] life it's because that there is life
[17:29] that it's reflected
[17:38] from
[17:41] so says a tree is traving because there
[17:46] is a
[17:53] tree now in the Garden of Eden this tree
[17:57] was perfect
[18:03] now
[18:07] struggling because in the New Jerusalem
[18:10] there is a
[18:14] tree and the man also in the Garden of
[18:17] Eden was H there was no
[18:24] disease there was no
[18:27] sin that's why now he is struggling
[18:32] today because in the New
[18:36] Jerusalem he is perfect
[18:42] eternally now my Prophet
[18:47] says because there is life
[18:51] somewhere and I believe that when God
[18:54] made
[18:56] men he started
[18:58] reflecting the smaller
[19:04] things amen amen so he made the
[19:08] trees then he made
[19:12] men and the last thing that ever come
[19:14] from the earth in the form of creation
[19:18] was
[19:23] man nothing
[19:25] higher nothing higher
[19:28] ever come
[19:34] came because
[19:37] why he's referring to
[19:40] men it was a perfect reflection of the
[19:44] highest in
[19:51] heaven so man is the perfect
[19:57] reflection of the highest in
[20:03] heaven that's why you know the last the
[20:06] end time
[20:09] message speaks of God and
[20:14] [Applause]
[20:16] man and to bring the whole thing
[20:20] back it has to come back to God and
[20:26] Men that's why brother
[20:29] says the
[20:32] original the second
[20:36] Adam has come to take the
[20:43] second the first one
[20:47] failed now he he he speaks of the second
[20:51] Adam Jesus
[20:56] Christ and he says he Bright
[21:01] Now can never
[21:04] fail because he says the second second
[21:09] is the
[21:13] word now says the also
[21:17] of is
[21:22] the now this the husband and wife canot
[21:26] say and
[21:31] because with the
[21:33] [Music]
[21:36] first the prophet
[21:38] says the word God gave them never found
[21:42] a
[21:46] place that's
[21:47] why they
[21:50] fell he says that word found place in
[21:57] Mary
[22:01] and It produced a
[22:06] son and
[22:08] now reading
[22:10] here now he says man was the
[22:15] highest the perfect
[22:21] reflection of the highest in
[22:26] heaven which God is a
[22:36] man you
[22:38] see God
[22:41] said let us make men in our
[22:52] image okay now he
[22:55] says which God is is a
[23:02] man God which is a
[23:07] man all
[23:09] right
[23:11] and I will
[23:15] noty that we are reflecting the almighty
[23:19] [Applause]
[23:21] God amen amen so now I I I'm trying to
[23:26] follow something here
[23:32] now God is a
[23:35] man which is God's
[23:41] place we even we read even yesterday in
[23:45] our
[23:47] book that God made a place in a man for
[23:56] himself Andy because now we are in
[23:59] another
[24:02] tacle if I got I've got the book here I
[24:05] will stra read
[24:09] it you know we are trying to find
[24:16] ourselves we are trying to know
[24:21] ourselves
[24:23] am so that we can
[24:26] walk knowing who
[24:33] and I read
[24:35] here where he
[24:37] says the little compartment in the heart
[24:41] of
[24:44] men God made that in there for
[24:52] himself maybe let me just talk and and
[24:55] not
[24:56] preach
[24:59] the compartment in the heart of
[25:04] men which we call the
[25:09] soul God made that in there for
[25:16] himself that mean that is his
[25:21] place that's that is his control
[25:26] room
[25:29] and he says there to control
[25:35] you then the prophet says that is his
[25:43] place that is God's
[25:47] place now if you want to talk to
[25:52] somebody it's always better to go and
[25:55] meet him in his place
[26:04] amen if you want to make your point
[26:10] clear go
[26:12] to the person's
[26:16] Place amen so he
[26:19] says this
[26:22] compartment in the heart of
[26:25] men is God's
[26:31] place that's where he sends his messages
[26:38] from which is the control
[26:43] [Applause]
[26:46] room
[26:52] nowday you will only hear the word of
[26:56] God
[26:59] from the
[27:04] men it will prove itself in
[27:10] the I'm trying to say to
[27:14] you even the
[27:18] Jews they missed
[27:22] God because when God was a
[27:26] man they were looking up to
[27:32] heaven so they couldn't find
[27:35] him
[27:37] because you need to meet him in his
[27:45] place you need to come to temps and come
[27:49] to where he
[27:53] is so we have learned
[27:56] today
[27:58] to meet God in his
[28:02] place and that
[28:05] place is also my
[28:09] [Music]
[28:11] place because the secret
[28:15] is God and
[28:18] men in a
[28:21] [Music]
[28:22] place brother one
[28:26] time I don't know whether was with
[28:31] us now he he says to
[28:35] me with some other
[28:38] brothers he says you know
[28:42] brother I asked God I said to God I want
[28:46] to see
[28:50] you and then he
[28:52] says after
[28:55] that I saw you the pastor
[29:00] now
[29:02] he God said oh you want to see
[29:06] me and he says then he had a like a a
[29:12] dream a vision dream he doesn't
[29:20] understand then he saw he says I then I
[29:24] saw you the
[29:26] pastor
[29:27] [Music]
[29:29] so that was the answer
[29:34] from you want to see
[29:37] me then I see then I saw the
[29:43] pastor what does that
[29:45] mean God is saying to
[29:49] him look
[29:52] there okay I will read something here
[29:55] while reading here
[30:00] brother he
[30:02] says the Holy
[30:04] Spirit spoke to
[30:07] him and he said if you can get this
[30:11] people to believe
[30:12] [Music]
[30:21] you if you can get this people to
[30:24] believe
[30:26] you
[30:28] amen now this is what Jesus says
[30:32] here believe in
[30:36] God
[30:42] also now if they believe in
[30:46] God then God is
[30:50] a the Lord Jesus
[30:53] says believe in
[30:55] God believe so in the
[31:03] manifestation amen because if believe
[31:07] God God is a
[31:10] spirit then it will bring you down to
[31:13] the
[31:18] Manifest it is God
[31:26] now
[31:29] amen so believe in
[31:32] God believe also in me says the Lord
[31:35] Jesus
[31:36] [Music]
[31:38] Christ so you don't believe in two
[31:42] Gods you believe in
[31:45] God God is a
[31:47] spirit believe
[31:50] also in the second in the
[31:55] second you know you know he he comes in
[31:59] three
[32:02] stages believe in
[32:05] God and now when God is in a
[32:08] man believe in the second
[32:13] stage amen that
[32:16] means believe God where he
[32:23] is amen am and if he is in
[32:28] heaven you believe God in
[32:31] heaven if Jesus says God is in
[32:34] me believe God where he
[32:39] is amen that's how you find
[32:44] him and you become
[32:47] [Music]
[32:51] aced because you believe
[32:54] him where he is
[33:01] so
[33:02] now he
[33:06] says brother says to a person
[33:10] here do you believe me to go to be God's
[33:13] [Music]
[33:17] Prophet amen he says because God
[33:22] says if you can cause them to believe
[33:25] you
[33:30] that means believing
[33:34] God me God's
[33:39] Prophet because
[33:41] God speaks to you through me your
[33:49] Prophet I'm talking
[33:54] about so it is to find God where he
[34:02] is now Moses one
[34:06] time he said to
[34:08] God Show
[34:12] Me Your
[34:16] Glory Show Me Your
[34:19] Glory and what God
[34:23] did he said I will I will hide
[34:27] I'll make you to stand on a
[34:33] rock then you shall see me as I pass
[34:39] by amen now because he wants to see the
[34:43] glory of
[34:45] God brother as he says in the Bible he
[34:48] saw the heart of
[34:55] men because he wants to see the glory of
[35:00] God then he sees part of
[35:06] men so
[35:09] now now he say
[35:13] here coming down
[35:16] this the Samaritan woman if I've got the
[35:19] book
[35:22] here speaks of this women here from
[35:27] Samaritan and uh he
[35:30] says this
[35:33] woman let me read
[35:35] it this little
[35:39] woman her first life was up
[35:43] here her first life was
[35:47] here a
[35:50] prostitute amen amen so she was mixed
[35:55] up
[35:57] now when Jesus
[36:00] came the priest looked at
[36:05] him and they called him a
[36:07] [Music]
[36:09] devil but this little
[36:13] woman she had
[36:16] nothing she was dty and filthy a
[36:19] [Music]
[36:22] prostitute but not his way down in her
[36:28] she's got
[36:33] representation amen and then she was
[36:36] looking for this to be made
[36:44] flesh
[36:46] because that that thing must come to
[36:52] a
[36:55] fulfillment
[36:57] a
[36:59] manifestation so she was
[37:03] waiting looking for it to be made
[37:09] flesh because she says we know that
[37:13] Messiah
[37:15] comeing and when he come he will tell us
[37:18] all
[37:21] things he was wait she was waiting for
[37:24] that to be made flesh
[37:29] because it couldn't help
[37:32] her when it was just the
[37:37] word she had to wait until that word was
[37:41] made
[37:45] flesh and when the was
[37:49] made then she was closer closer to
[37:54] God and she speak with him in his
[38:02] place you know the
[38:04] people in the olden
[38:06] [Music]
[38:08] days used to be represented by the high
[38:11] priest in the
[38:18] ho the high priest supposed to walk and
[38:21] go into
[38:25] the
[38:27] and God spoke to
[38:32] him
[38:34] so God was in that
[38:37] place would come in that
[38:40] place and the high
[38:43] priest has to
[38:45] come
[38:52] with the names of the children of
[38:55] Israel
[38:58] before the
[39:01] Lord there in the holy of
[39:04] H and when
[39:06] [Music]
[39:07] Moses God said to
[39:10] Moses let them make me an
[39:15] [Applause]
[39:16] ark and put upon the ark the seat of
[39:22] mercy and facing one another
[39:30] and I will speak to
[39:32] you from off
[39:41] the amen so now
[39:45] Moses had to go
[39:48] there before the
[39:51] AR amen
[39:55] amen
[39:57] now in the heart
[39:59] [Music]
[40:03] of
