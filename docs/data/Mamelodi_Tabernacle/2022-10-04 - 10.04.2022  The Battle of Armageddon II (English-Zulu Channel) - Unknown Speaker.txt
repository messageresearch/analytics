the pulpit at half i repeat in the morning the pastor takes the pulpit at half past 10 in the morning yeah the song service starts around nine o'clock or even earlier but the pastor takes the pulpit have mustang now sometimes they may be delays with the lane sometimes because normally the first service they may be delays but half past 10 we believe the pastor will be able to take it in the afternoon the pastor will take the pulpit at 15 30 p.m the song service may start at but the pastor will take the pulpit at 3 p.m and anyway now the mamillary tabernacle this wall will be locked for that three days there is an arrangement for the believers in tembisa there is a hall that has been arranged in tembisa i may not pronounce the name correctly but i believe is same silent community

don't like to park at that crowd but that's the only place we have please don't park around the neighborhood it's a very serious complaint and it is very difficult for us when the neighbors come shouting at us angry at us as if we want to announce this we had an incident this morning that the young man was sweating at one of our brothers because somebody parked at the neighbor's place can we respect our in the right names one day the lord god will honor us and give us power and remember the neighbors respect our past so let us also respect our pastor yes the question that we have can we

stand out for the reading we shall thank for our scriptures the last week scriptures says yes sir revelation chapter 16 from verse 12 to 16. and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs came out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest they he walk naked and they see his and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon our heavenly father will come again this morning just for nothing else but to hear from our lord jesus christ you are so wonderful to our hearts we are longing to meet you to see you now in your corporate body and we know further time is has arrived age is closing and the father we have seen you your word come taking us this far and the lord i know that the signs are there especially gog and magog which the people don't understand they they just think it's just a war but they we know that it is leading to jerusalem and the father we are glad this morning as we see the signs now father opening up before our eyes and our hearts we're asking even this morning again to send down to our souls further what we intended to put in our souls this morning we thank you lord as we bow our heads in prayer father to honor thee your father this morning we know we are going to see you again this morning as i pray in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated brethren i you know i was just looking for what sometimes could disturb some of the things we have prepared here being subways in these interviews it's for a certain brother i [Music] now we are here we are going to take a part of it and you know a brother was saying to me unfortunately while we are inside here to take from god known for i will find a brother sitting there eating pie or my head or something my we are going to continue reading the word of the lord and then i was reading something everything here especially in mount melody we call it underwater intolerance if you bring was that from america now for the children cartoons and so forth now i want to let her have a papaya it is we say it is of the underworld in our city no is the underworld that that is coming this way underwater city in the world amen then i said yes because we have uh this morning [Music] [Music] they don't believe let me read you this party the sinner is influenced by the holy spirit and the wrong gives him and the wrong gives influence and the right to give influence from um with blackness and separation are dominated from the undown world of devils okay notice the wicked or the unbeliever is influenced from beneath on a caller there is so i'm going to leave it like this until we come to it amen the trinity of heaven and trinity years old jesus even said jesus the unbelievers confronted him the reason we cannot agree to say you are from nibuya i am from about me can you read it brother and he said unto them we are from beneath uh just that way where he started 19 then said they unto him where is thy father jesus answered he never know me nor my father if he had known me he should have known my father also this word spake jesus in the treasure as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come then said jesus again unto them i go my way and he shall seek me and shall die in your sins whether i go he cannot come then said the jews will he kill himself because he saith whether i go it cannot come and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world amen that that's it now let's take it from here i see chatter from the battle of armageddon he better offer market and it is misunderstood by the people he did the abandoning the reason why they don't understand this is hard to follow because it will happen after the tribulation period after the tribulation amen now we we just want to look at the the way it is unfolding you know if you were to tell somebody about something [Music] a woman if that person whom ah never be around after the what did i say after the tribulation at that time will he be able to understand what's in this season you will be the only person will understand is the one who will be around at that particular time now is the person who knows that after the tribulation period then this and this will god has told you about the battle of armageddon [Music] you know it is i think that god you have a headache go into oil and they have seen an oil that's what you will be able to understand amen so that's why you can preach about a thing for a thousand years [Music] as long as it is out of is beyond time but the woman is seen as cutting then and you are talking to a person after the church ages now i understand that imagining now that will mean that to those who can hear me amen those who can hear this word when it will happen are you gonna be there this subject is for you [Music] i will be there after the tribulation period and then i'm going to preach to you then finish the whole thing and where is it is this one for oh yeah because somewhere it's written or the first part now the first battle [Music] amen we have one here starting from the woman in the that is that is verse 12 126. [Music] can i point at that one there was one two six oh i don't know if i've got mine here it's off the wall now is on all right oh but for pointing i should point there okay now the first thing revelation chapter 12 verse 1 of revelation 12 verse 1 to 6 6. did you read that ok just read it please sing i phoned and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars and she being with child christ travailing in birth and pains to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throat and the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared of god that they should fit her there a thousand two hundred and three quarters amen amen that that that's it now [Music] here we are a great wonder in heaven this manga is because every everything is coming from we started there you know i was listening brother branham talking about the first bible it was in zodiac says that is the first bible [Music] and that's when they are referring [Music] god [Music] and furthermore he says let's leave it for now uh just wait until i find for you which one linda in total but i was just trying to say me together with the following verse 7 of the same chapter it says in heaven the woman being speaking about israel the woman is [Music] [Music] battle of armageddon now it comes after the tribulation [Music] [Music] about what's gonna take place because it is the one hundred and forty four hundred thousand hundred and forty four thousand amen [Music] we will be

that said upon him was called faithful and true all right now we are told that stephens situation stephen when they stoned him [Music] 7 but he being full of the holy ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god amen was looking through an open door [Music] to bless me again with my students no we are blessed here in this church we

glory because you are weaker you were to ask a question to say to us i would be the first one to [Music] that's what it says then i will read one party because the prophet even says notice clean spirit spirits gone from a man or sugar dry places that's exactly what the church has done [Music] my baptism those who believe in sanctification then jesus said the unclean spirit that went out turns back we are bored all right but then if that house isn't filled and occupied but yet it is amen amen a house isn't filled it isn't occupied leon licking and call then the devil empty then with seven other spirits [Music] you know it is so in the bible and it says and the last stage of this place is seven times worse than it was let it says it speaks of the overcomers the church itself ibanka
