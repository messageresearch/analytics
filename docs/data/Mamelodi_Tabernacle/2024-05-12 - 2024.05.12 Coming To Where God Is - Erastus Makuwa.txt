Description:
Title: Coming To Where God Is
Preached by Pastor Erastus Makuwa at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 12 May 2024

Deuteronomy 16: 1-2 | Matthews 3: 13-17 | Revelation 10: 1-4, Genesis 1:1, 26: Exodus 6:3

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the Place where God is.

Preaching convicts a sinner and bring him under condemnation, but teaching brings a person positionaly.

Jesus commanded his desciples to go and preach to all creatures and then teach them. it must start with preaching and when the people have come you teach them.

The message in Egypt was to say come out, and the message in the wilderness was saying let us go forward. When they are about to enter the message must now say let us enter. And when they have entered they must be given their positions.

You can not come where God is if you do not know where he is, and if you do not know what he is and who he is.

The rich young ruler went to the place where eternal life was but he failed to get eternal life because he did not know what eternal life is.  You cannot worship God if you do not know who He is.

When Moses was were the pillar of fire was, meaning he was in the presence of God. It was a revelation for the Israelites to know that God was behind the badger skins.

David had two sons. Solomon was his natural son and Jesus was his spiritual son. Solomon build a tabernacle in the promise land, and during the dedication of the tabernacle the pillar of fire came in the temple.

When the people where worshiping God in the temple praying and praising, a virgin concieved . And she was among them as they worship but she knew the God they worship is in her. Even today there is a virgin who is impregnated with Him. and she is the only one that has the secret that the God the people are worshipping is in her. Before the virgin conceived she met the angel, and even the virgin of today has met an angel.

In the beginning the spirit of God moved above the waters, and when you look above those waters you see...

privilege to be in the house of the Lord some wanted to be but they failed but you managed to come here it's not because of your wisdom is because of the grace of God let us thank that Grace while standing on our feet let's open the book of chapter 16 H as we read verse 1 to 2 verse 1 to [Music] 2 theonomy 16: 1-2 observe the month of abib and keep the Passover unto the Lord thy God for in the month month of abib the Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt By Night thou shall therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God of the flock of the head in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there let's read those Matthew chapter 3 verse 13 to 6 to 17 verse 13 vers 13 to 17 17 then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan and to John to be baptized of him but John forbid him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me and Jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh unto us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dve and lightning upon him and L a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased let's read the last one chapter the last one while standing chapter 10 reel 10 ver 1-4 [Music] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven cloth with a cloud and a rain bow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to ride and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not let's close our eyes as we pray what Heavenly Father thank you for this privilege you have privileged me with my brother here Amen to stand in the secet place yes in front of your children amen be with us as we are about to deliver your way to your children yes let it be from you through us to your children Amen in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen you may take your [Music] seat at the topic I'm going to speak about um before I go to that topic let me read a quote here in the book of Hebrews Hebrews chapter page 20 992 page 92 paragraph 28 paragraph 28 it says here there is something about where you go what church you go to and what teacher teaches you did you know it he's got something to eat therefore we ought to seek out the very best that we can find so we are getting the best we are getting the best we are getting the best was saying we are getting the [Applause] I believe perhaps you also you are getting the best not because it is sociable it is because it is not because it is sociable or so forth but the real Bible teaching in other words we are getting the real Bible [Music] teaching um my topic is going to be coming to where God is I'm going to try to teach I'm not the but uh that's why I read the quote here is because our pastor here is the best teacher and I am his student and we have got brother is also the best teacher I am their student then um teaching it it convicted The Sinner and brings the sinner under condemnation but he says teaching brings his a person positionally when Jesus was commanding his disciples he said go and preach the gospel to Every Creature but and baptized them and those who believe bapti them and when those who were baptized they will be saved and after that you must teach them in other words it must be preaching and teaching it it mustn't be teaching and preaching it must be preaching and teaching because you cannot preach if people have come they've ran away from their places now they are here they must be placed positionally then you cannot preach to the people who have come you must teach them so that they can find their position that's why the prophet said an evangelist must never be a pastor because he is an evangelist the prophet says is a rolling ball of Fire is destroy then if you can bring an evangelist in the formal church he will drive the people out of the church but when the people have come they are waiting for you to teach them to show them their position when people were taken out of Egypt there was a message of taking them out and when they are in the wilderness there was another message in the wilderness because the first one it was saying come out the one in the wilderness it must say let's go forward it mustn't say come out where now it must say let's go forward then when they are about to enter they must it must say let's enter and when they have entered now they must they must be given their places you can't say you can't say to them come outen let's go brother come to where God is you cannot come to where God is if you don't know where he is and you must know what he is you must know what he is and you must know who he is are you together with then you can not go to somebody if you know where he is but if you don't know what he is you'll go to that place find him but because you don't know what is he what is he then you will never know but you'll be at the right place but you fail to find him there was a certain Young Rich Man Who rushed wanted to have eternal life he went straight to eternal life but because he don't know what eternal life was he came there where the eternal life was he came to that place life for was but he failed to get it because he he he didn't know what eternal life is but he wanted eternal life you must know what he is and who he is and if you are brought by somebody that person also must know where he is so that he can before he can take you to him in the beginning I'm going to read something for you here to to know who God is and where he is because we must know that you cannot worship God if you don't know him let me before we go any further go back genesis6 I will pick it up on I will pick it up Wednesday when God made man before he made man he called himself L El the word means in Hebrew men men self existence all by himself nothing existed before him he was old existence there ever was self existent one Elohim means the all sufficient all powerful Almighty self existent one then God was Elohim before the beginning and he said but in Genesis 2 when he made men he said now I am Jehovah I read in the middle of the paragraph Jehovah means the one who exist with his before he had family he was Elohim then then he had a family when he had a family that was male and female Adam and Eve it was called family then he was called Jehovah because Jehovah means the one who exist with his family he wasn't he wasn't Jehovah there he was Elohim but when he had family then he was called Jehovah are you together with me then there in in Exodus 6:3 Exodus 6 when he appeared to Moses he said to Moses I am Jehovah and I was not known by this name before I am Jehovah why why he called he tells Moses he is Jehovah because now Israel was his family then he was the pillar of fire because he appeared to Moses as the pillar of that Pillar of Fire was God when Moses was where the pillar of fire was he was where God was are you together means the pillar of fire was Jehovah because he said I am Jehovah and this name I was not known by it before you read it in in Exodus 6:3 63 then he told Moses Moses now I don't want to be above you I don't want to be above you isra because he was above them leading them as the pillar of fire during the night but during the day there was the pillar of cloud then he said to Moses I want to dwell among you then make me a place where I can dwell then Moses buil a in using the plan he go on the mountain then he he made that Tabernacle after he had made the Tabernacle when he was dedicating the tabern that pillar of cloud came down into that it was Jehovah am them and if you want to know where God is you must go to the Tabernacle the children of Israel they were sure that their God was there my pastor told me that it was a it was a revelation to the israelit to know that their God was behind those B then one day after David has built his own house when he was in his beautiful house he looked at he said I can't live in a beautiful house and my God lived in that tent there I must build my God a beautiful house a beautiful house more than my house then he go toan was a prophet he said to I want to build a place for my God then said you had a good Revelation let give me time then when pray then God told Nan tell my son my son David that he is not the one who will build me a temple his son will build me a temple David had two sons he had two sons yet Solomon was his son Jesus was his son Jesus was his son Solomon was his natural son and Jesus was his spiritual son when he says your son he was talking about the two Solomon's natural son David's sonon bu the temple but what when God was saying that he was talking about this David spiritual that he will build him a temp but even though even though Solomon buil a temple let me say this my precious brothers and sisters he lived in the Tabernacle Our God a tabernacle was a place when they were moving God was in there and when when he moved out of the tle they were sure that they had to move here and when he settled they know we must here we are here in our Tabernacles we are in our T this our is because we are on a journey when Israel reached the promised land is where Solomon buil a temple in the promised land we have Promise Land then our houses there David Jesus promised us in the Book of John he said I'm going to build your house in my father's house there are many mansions and we know we know when he said in my father's house he me in his in his father's family he said there are many mansions when he talks about the Mansions there he was talking about our bodies they are there he said I'm going to prepare then I must so that so that when where I am you should be there this is our because we are on our journey then we have got temples there we have got houses there as Paul said when this edly Tabernacle dissolve we have houses built by God this one is here by birth is born by sin shaped in iniquity coming to the speak Li you cannot perfect this one a then after Solomon has built the tle in the promised land then the children of Israel they were sure that their was in that on the day of dedication that Pillar of Fire came in that in that Temple their God was there he was there accessed by the high Prest once year here Moses told them if they want to do a service if they want to do go service they must go to that that is where God will receive the services he said you must not do go service at any place you must go where is even now if you want to Worship You must go where God is God God is Not everywhere he is worship where he [Music] is but you must know he always has a place where if you want to worship Him you must go there even now he has got a place he said I don't dwell in the place built by by [Music] men but just place we must know the place isra knew that place that's why when he was in the temple even even if they were in the Exiles there when they want to worship and pray they would they would look towards Jerusalem they would look towards the temple Jerusalem when they when they looking towards there would listen to them you know how David you know how Daniel were worshiping he would he made a a window towards Jerusalem so that when he worship he must worship looking towards that window towards Jerusalem and he knew his God to receive his worship because he is there in the temple Jerusalem what about us when they were still worshiping God in the temple worshiping him praising him a vision conceived prophets after Prophet they were prophesying that there is God coming there is God coming there is God coming until a prophet the last one saying I'm going to send my messenger before my face you will prepare my my way because the Lord you are looking for will come to his Temple that was malter 3 he was talking about God coming into his Temple but they were worshiping at the temple thinking that he is there but this prophet he says is coming to the temple they thought perhaps they thought it will be recom but while they were worshiping the vision con when the vision conceived they were still worshiping praying in the temple but the vision con when he was with them in the temple when they were Jehovah Our God he was just laughing in his heart the god they worshiping is in me she was the only one who had that secret even now in our age there is a vision who is pregnated with [Applause] him and that vision is the only one he is climbing texes with people he went to shops with people he St with them he has got families he's the only one who knows the she is the only one before the vision could conceive she met the angel even this the vision I'm talking even this Vision I'm talking about today she met the angel [Applause] [Music] amen the angel said You shall be a child call his name Jesus because he shall save his people from their sin he he is a child but he has got his people [Music] that's why when they were worshiping then there she was looking at them the god that woring is in me one day because their child was born after being born he grew she was named Jesus she grew among them when she has grown when he has grown up one day he went he went to the River Jordan when he went to the River Jordan John was there baptizing people people coming to him then this one also came let me read for you here amen Jesus walked right straight out into the water to him who him John them two eyes of John made them two eyes of Jesus they were second cousins by flesh Mary and Elizabeth were their eyes met one another there was there was God and His Prophet amen standing there are you with me men two men standing inside the water but my Prophet here he said there was a prophet and his God one of those men there was a prophet one of those men there was his God was the god of another he said John said I have need to be baptized of Thee why Come Thou to me Jesus said suffer it to be now so but remember thus it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness why did John do it because he was the sacrifice the man who was before John he was the sacrifice John was a prophet he knew that the sacrifice has got to be washed before it can be presented oh yes and he suffered him he baptized him when he had when he had low the heavens open oh my and that d come down upon him a voice said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell King James it put it like this in whom I am pleased to dwell so it's just any way you want to turn it around in or or or I am pleased to dwell it depends in what way you want to put then our Prophet say the God himself this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in God and men becoming one that day it was God and men becoming one it was the manifestation or fulfillment of Mali chapter 3 on that day man and God becoming one God moving into another Temple can you FL something there if you can if you can flesh it there it is I don't have a point here but I've already passed there this thing you know it's just a it's just a revision of what you already know in Genesis one and one he says in the beginning let me read it for you you must not forget we are going to where God is because he's always there the problem is that people don't know where he is but they want to worship him in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters God is a spirit the Bible says the spirit of God was moving upon the face of the waters and he said there that spirit that was moving there it was and the prophet calls it a fountain of seven colors in other words when you were looking on that fa the face of that daughter you were seeing a rainbow a rainbow has seven color it was moving upon the wat and then John 1: it says that in the beginning there was the word the word was with God and the Word was God then God spirit came down when he came down he be in other words those seven colors came together when those seven colors came together it formed a logos the weight that's what the Bible says in the beginning there was the weight and the word let me read it the word was with God and the way was God are you together with me in the beginning was the weight the weight was with God the we logos theop was with the spirit it was the spirit there before it can be the weight in other words all when all those seven colors came together it form the word and the word it it is called a theop logos then it is also called Christ the pillar of Fire Son of God angel of the cant all those things is the weight is God when when he came in a form where he could be seen because when he was the pillar of fire you could see the pillar of but when was the spirit you couldn't see anything are you together with me he was coming to a form where he could be seen then he was aop you could see there you could read those as Pages there it will tell you exactly like that that those seven colors came together then from that theop in below there I've written Spirit there then I going this way I've written thoughts in other words God from Spirit he came to be a theophany and from the theophany he became flesh in John 14 1 ver4 joh 1: say the we was made flesh in other words the theop became flesh in other words all those scholar it was only in one man which was Jesus when you see Jesus moving there all those Scholars it was in him [Applause] are you together with me and with the prophet and with my pastor amen and then it says there when he was Spirit we were Spirits we were we were in him as thoughts we were in him as thoughts Adam was the thought of God expressed you are the thought of God Express but the the was the thought of God expressed but we by passed our theop because when he become a theist we were theist but we bypass those theop then we to become flesh so that we can be tested are you together with us we move from thoughts to flesh but Jesus moved from Spirit from thoughts to theop from theop flesh because we were flesh so that he can move us back to carry us back to again because we them I was just passing there are you together with me but where where where where was I going I was going to where um Jesus was the place of God go he was the temple of God if you have got the seat in your hand you you know what the seat is if you have got the seat in your hand because Jesus says himself I am a corn a corn of wheat the word of God is a seat the Bible says so then if you have got a se you have got everything but is is one but in it there are Roots there are stems there are leaves there are flowers there are fruits there are other seats inside this seat but even if you can break it down if you can break it to look inside if you want to find the The Roots there you can't find them but they are [Music] there amen but if you want to find those lives there you must put the seat in a in the in the in the good soil in the condition then now you will see the stem you will see the roots then you see the stem then you see leaves then you see flowers coming from the something you have placed in the soil but that thing must rot first the seat you have placed there it must Ro in order to bring something up all right are you with us here let me read something here for you in this book here I just want to go back a little read it for you so that you can hear is the prophet who says those now here is what happened this gets me right where I love it see the logos this great Fountain this great Fountain of spirit which had no Beginning No End this great spirit begin to form in the creation logos that went out from it was the son of God it was the only visible form that the spirit had it was a theop which means a body the body was like a [Music] man that was that that it it is the same type of a body that we receive when we die here if this early Tabernacle be dissolved we have for one already waiting that was it that was the theop that was the theop which was the Son of God the Sun the logos became flesh because we were put in flesh and in the theop the logos became flesh here Among Us it was nothing else but the dwelling place for that entire fountain dwelt in him there he is that was the one that is I just want to show you that it is the prophet who says the whole Fountain was in that man the whole Fountain came together and become the man then that man was a temple which was spoken by Malachi 3 was in him and people some could recognize that God was there but they didn't leave worshiping they went on praising they went on trying to worship but they were worshiping where God was not there even now people are still worshiping but they're worshiping where God is not there they think God is there they build their own denomination after building their own denin they give the denomination the name after giving the name they say our God is [Music] here how how is he got in there because you have bu your own thing and you have called Your Own Thing the name but they say our God is here he is here with us then they worship he sing they do whatever they want to do they pray for the sick some of the sick get healed but God is Not There the prophet says we preach salvation as salvation is for all but we know that salvation is not for all but we preach it we preach healing as if healing is for all but we know that healing is not for all some people recognized that God is in this man just like Philip Philip recognized that God was there and he went to call to bring where God is if you don't know where God is you cannot bring somebody because you don't know where he if you have fire you have make it or you have you find it t and you find somebody who is getting cold who who is shering with coldness you must just took the man by the hand or that woman pull him to the fire where the fire is but you must not show him the picture of fire if you show him the picture of fire he will even die say Amen am but take the man with a hand lead him to the fire when he approached fire you'll see him raising his hand towards the fire you see him like this because he's the one who's feeling the heat now you'll never tell him turn turn around turn around this way now this way because he is at the right place see what happened to Philip when he brought Nathaniel there said the one the prophets in the law talked about I have found him is Jesus of nazare when he brought nael to the fire before Philip could say yeah this is the man Jesus spoke if you bring people to where Jesus is you bring people to where God is speak yes sir before Philip can say something God spoke said this is the Beloved a true servant of God how do you know me he said before Philip I saw you studying the Bible there answered the Son of God he knew who this man is because he came to where fire is Philip say say You must say he if you bring someone who is predestinated to a predestinate Place something in him will tell her or him who is this man he will say something you will never teach him how to pray you must always pray brother you must always read the Bible he himself will read the the Bible he himself will pray he himself will need God more because if you have brought a person where God is then he will get whatever he wants amen but only to where God is also Samaritan womanize that that God is there then he brought she brought people there and when they were there they also saw this is God is here this is God they said to him now we see he don't go on because now we ourselves we see we ourselves we can hear that these are people who have come to the place when that's it because he is the full he was he was all all things were in him when he was building his church which was the seven Church Ages which was which the the r the which the foundation thereof was Jewish the body was Gentiles and the roof thereof was Christ himself when he was building his church he unfolded [Music] himself but me go back there on the day of P he unfold himself there came in as a of himself among them they were the places from one place to many places because when Saul was trying to persecute Christians when Saul was trying to persecute Christians Jesus himself said you are persecuting me because it was him in them if you persecute them you persecute him he was there even when Cornelius when he was looking for God he was worshiping loving God doing all things and God recognized that this man love me but he's in a wrong place he don't know where I am he said go to Peter because Peter is the place where I am you cannot find me anywhere go to Peter while Peter came there he was bringing good there while he was just speaking just you see the one who you took with your crucified they started to speak in Tong [Applause] [Music] oh came in them from Peter [Music] them he was in another Temple Peter was where God is if you want go to where Peter is even Paul said they glorified god in me he was that place where God is he said if they receive you they receive me if they reject you they reject me there are people who can come where he is but fail to see him 70 disciples I don't know whether we have got such people here who would come where he is but fail to see him 70 disciple came came where he is but failed to see him that's why they thought when they were leaving Jesus they thought they they were leaving the men they are going to worship God better some let's leave this man but when it comes to Peter Peter why don't you go he said Qui can I go and worship because worship is here worship is where God is worshiped In Heaven There where God was he said where were you job when I laid the foundation when the sons of God when the stars sing when the sons of God shouted with Jo Worship in heaven that's why now worship has come down [Applause] here let me show you when worship come to [Music] you he took the book open the book book hallu and take and took the book open it come down with the book in 10 he was coming with the book open where is he coming with the book where is he going with the let me read something here but the first thing that represented the dark Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he took the book glory to God open the book to off the seals send it down to the Earth to the seventh angel to the seventh angel to reveal it to his people let me tell you what happened here when he when the prophet says those words to the people who were in that book he said the congregation greatly Rejoice because he was telling the people they could understand they could see that the book is here there you are oh my am what happened the screams the shouts the Hallelujah the anointed the power the glory the manifestation when the book left heaven and was brought back it came with worship that's why the Bible says there was silence in why why now where is that where is that shout now is here on worship is where the book is open amen when when those seven colors unfold [Music] themselves it was God it was God building his church he started I said he started it there Foundation was jewi was gentil can you show it there it was that seat placed in the good soil then he started to unfold itself those seven colors started to come one by one the first color the second color the third the seventh color that was God in all those seven Church ages in all those colors you show the pyramid if you can if you can if it is not that don't worry but it was those yeah this is the pyramid you see it those was God unfolding himself it was the first color Second Color the third color all those seven colors of a rainbow they form that pyramid the pyramid is the seven colors of and at the end there those seven colors when they when when those seven colors come to an end it came together again then it form that headstone there when it comes together again it form that headstone but after the seven Church those seven colors came together in the beginning when they came together they form that theop now at the end time when they come together again they form that [Applause] if you don't see it we will say you are [Music] blind because it is where we are living now is where we see everything coming together let me see if I can see something here for you because he in our day he says um I see it doesn't matter it says God and man they were one there Goden man he says now God and man is one here they said when John was baptizing Jesus God and Men became one there they were one there when John was baptizing Jesus now in our day when those seven colors coming together again now Goen men became one [Music] because when he was building his church he built it with seven spirits in seven Messengers we he build this seven spirit in seven Messengers through seven Church ages and each each age it was the place where God was he was there in the first church God was there because those seven Messengers they were making God [Music] known let me read something here making God know without seven Messengers you wouldn't know God these seven Messengers are making God known to the people he that receiveth them receive him [Music] sent them John 13202 they speak and act upon his authority he stand behind them with the power of God because when they came together there was a man here in their last days that the book was given to him this man revealed to God God revealed himself through him because he says the son of [Music] man the seventh angel revealed the son of man he says like this a son of man the son of man he says MCC was revealed in the form of a prophet in other ways now all those seven what those seven colors in a theop form came into a man then he says men gold and men were one there God and Men is one here where God is is where the praise of worship is it was from God to the messenger you must know under every message they were pastors are you together with me under every messenger there were pastors there and under every Pastor they are Shi and that Pastor there becomes the place of worship amen the voice of God Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and the voice of God comes is the word of God and where the word of God is is where the voice of God is and the voice the voice is the word of God revealed for your age where the voice of God is Jesus says I am he says my sheep hear my voice and he says I am a good shepherd Jesus said so and if Jesus Is a Good Shepherd he said I will make Shepherd in for him to make Shepherds he must come down and choose a man and he must dwell in that man when he's in that man he that man is the voice of God the Prophet said forgive me if I make you
