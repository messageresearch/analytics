[53:44] together so all we all know that we
[53:48] are at the highest point
[53:52] [Music]
[53:54] now uh the there seventh
[53:58] seal is the highest
[54:02] point it's the
[54:04] [Music]
[54:05] Zen and when
[54:08] you stand at the
[54:11] Zen or when you stand at the highest
[54:16] point you could see all
[54:21] over you could see the past
[54:26] and you could see your
[54:29] present and you could see the
[54:34] future we are in the last
[54:38] days we can see those
[54:41] things and the only way of seeing
[54:45] it of course is to be right at the
[54:48] highest
[54:52] point so now in other words
[54:56] when we are at the highest
[54:59] point we are able to see
[55:04] eternity and then we will always
[55:09] know actually where we
[55:13] are I always like
[55:18] to uh explain my my my my
[55:24] title so that you should
[55:28] understand and because once you miss the
[55:33] title you could heare a very
[55:37] nice
[55:40] sermon but you missed the
[55:43] point because each and
[55:48] everyon has got a
[55:51] purose it may it must take you a step
[55:55] further
[55:58] it's not just a nice good
[56:02] sermon but it has to
[56:06] do with the
[56:09] process of your Christian
[56:14] life so now the word of
[56:19] God is Not
[56:23] stagnant it's it's moving
[56:26] he
[56:27] says when the
[56:30] word comes comes out of his
[56:34] mouth it will not return
[56:38] void you see so now even
[56:44] ourselves we we we need
[56:48] to
[56:50] uh go with the same
[56:53] process uh I think we are together
[56:57] together so now I've got a
[57:01] slide which I always carry it with
[57:06] me that says we we we come from
[57:11] heaven and we are going back to
[57:15] Heaven I would like the brothers to to
[57:18] uh just put it
[57:22] on because
[57:24] uh the Bible
[57:31] says the one that is from
[57:34] Heaven is returning back to
[57:37] heaven now this slide of mine some of
[57:40] you is not the first time that they see
[57:43] it now the
[57:47] Zenith or the highest
[57:50] point it's when you
[57:54] see from from eternity to
[58:00] Eternity as you can see this
[58:03] slide it's got a pyramid right in the
[58:10] center and then
[58:13] uh there is where it's written in red it
[58:17] says
[58:21] heaven and
[58:24] then then it's different
[58:28] dispensation and on and on and on as you
[58:31] can round
[58:33] it you see the pillar of
[58:37] fire you see the the Ring The Ring of
[58:43] Eternity it moves
[58:46] on until it reach the
[58:50] Gentiles as you follow it you could see
[58:53] it oh yeah
[58:56] until you see where now the pointer is
[59:00] the red where it says
[59:04] Gentiles that is our
[59:07] time and then you
[59:09] see what we are waiting for is for the
[59:11] repure is also in R you
[59:14] see but if you could go back my brother
[59:18] start from
[59:19] heaven and so we'll have there I don't
[59:22] have it with me okay let me look at this
[59:24] side
[59:26] from
[59:29] Eden and the the time of
[59:33] Noah then
[59:35] Abraham Isaac ISAC Jacob Jacob
[59:41] Joseph Moses all those are
[59:45] dispensation
[59:47] josua
[59:48] jurges the
[59:50] Kings until the Messiah
[59:53] comes for those that don't know
[59:57] while we are still
[59:58] there the
[1:00:00] Messiah came to the
[1:00:03] Jews not for
[1:00:07] us then he was rejected by the
[1:00:11] Jews then he came to the
[1:00:14] Gentiles now to the
[1:00:17] Jews the
[1:00:19] Messiah came as the son of man
[1:00:26] to kep the the the Jewish
[1:00:32] pyramid but he was
[1:00:36] rejected and then that's how we were
[1:00:38] crafted
[1:00:42] in we we got
[1:00:45] in as the
[1:00:48] Gentiles because Mah was rejected
[1:00:52] by are we
[1:00:54] together now
[1:00:57] we are at the point where we have to
[1:01:00] change our
[1:01:04] bodies that is what we call
[1:01:07] Rapture after that
[1:01:10] Rapture and then God goes back to the
[1:01:17] Jews then there will be that battle of
[1:01:22] go which is Ezekiel 38
[1:01:26] e in the time of
[1:01:29] tribulation of Moses and
[1:01:32] Elijah and then there will be the battle
[1:01:36] ofon then after the battle
[1:01:38] ofon then we've got
[1:01:41] Millennium there's a war of Co
[1:01:45] and of
[1:01:48] Revelation
[1:01:50] then there's white Throne
[1:01:53] judgment white judgment and then new
[1:01:57] Jerusalem now when you worship
[1:02:01] God you must know exactly where you
[1:02:05] are and and when you read your
[1:02:09] Bible you'll be able to place your
[1:02:12] verses
[1:02:15] accordingly when you read the
[1:02:18] verse that refers to the
[1:02:22] Jewish you will know that this is not
[1:02:25] mine
[1:02:26] but you'll read it for knowledge to
[1:02:30] knowledge but you should know where you
[1:02:33] are and what you are supposed to
[1:02:36] do because what you need
[1:02:39] now is a rapturing
[1:02:42] faith and the rapturing pH is what we
[1:02:46] call the seventh
[1:02:48] seene you see where I've written
[1:02:53] Rapture that has to do with your seventh
[1:02:58] seed that is why it's so
[1:03:02] important because the seventh SE it's
[1:03:05] it's Christ
[1:03:07] himself and Christ
[1:03:10] himself is the word
[1:03:12] himself and the word
[1:03:15] himself is God
[1:03:17] himself and God
[1:03:19] himself now is in
[1:03:24] you right amen that is says the poten
[1:03:27] you are a potential
[1:03:31] God now that comes through a
[1:03:35] revelation it's not something that you
[1:03:37] can teach a
[1:03:39] person you preach the
[1:03:42] word and then the person that
[1:03:45] listens and is
[1:03:48] predestinated then this thing is
[1:03:50] revealed unto
[1:03:52] you that's called your new name
[1:03:56] because the
[1:03:58] Revelation detects who you
[1:04:02] are it had to
[1:04:05] do with the
[1:04:08] predestination so now the seventh
[1:04:11] SE has got a
[1:04:13] power that power is called the third
[1:04:18] pool now the third pool is calling
[1:04:22] things into existence
[1:04:26] are we together amen
[1:04:30] now the prophet
[1:04:33] says the
[1:04:34] word is now in the
[1:04:37] bride and the
[1:04:39] bride knows what to do with
[1:04:43] it are we together he says you know what
[1:04:47] to do with
[1:04:49] it because you have thus said the
[1:04:53] Lord now you must know
[1:04:56] whether you have said or
[1:05:00] not and if you don't have you should ask
[1:05:04] yourself
[1:05:06] question why don't I have thus said the
[1:05:10] Lord because he says you
[1:05:13] know what to
[1:05:15] do with it because you have thus said
[1:05:20] the
[1:05:22] Lord are we
[1:05:24] together this is just to show
[1:05:26] you that now
[1:05:31] whenever uh God processed
[1:05:35] us it process us to different dimensions
[1:05:38] I mean different yeah
[1:05:42] dimensions are we together and
[1:05:47] dispensations so now you must not be
[1:05:51] ignorant of
[1:05:53] that must know you must must be able to
[1:05:56] place
[1:06:00] yourself are we together okay fine
[1:06:04] now the Bible
[1:06:07] says uh I would like us to read Romans
[1:06:10] chapter 1 verse
[1:06:12] 17 I'm still
[1:06:16] introducing my title so that you should
[1:06:19] know the
[1:06:22] Zen point
[1:06:26] which is the highest
[1:06:30] point
[1:06:33] Pinnacle verse uh 17 uh my brother
[1:06:36] Romans 1 verse 17 for therein is the
[1:06:41] rightousness of God revealed from Faith
[1:06:43] to Faith as it is written the just shall
[1:06:47] live by faith now here the Bible
[1:06:51] says the righteousness of God
[1:06:56] is revealed from
[1:07:00] Faith to Faith you see it's a process is
[1:07:06] going it's a faith upon
[1:07:09] Faith now
[1:07:11] Faith to Faith it takes you
[1:07:16] higher last
[1:07:18] time I told you about the different
[1:07:23] Fates
[1:07:25] that there
[1:07:27] are some
[1:07:29] people that they've got a fluctuating
[1:07:35] Faith now the prophet speaks about the
[1:07:38] perfect
[1:07:41] faith that is that does not
[1:07:48] fluctuate that is says now that's why
[1:07:50] the Bible
[1:07:52] says the
[1:07:54] just shall
[1:07:56] believe by
[1:07:58] faith and the Bible also
[1:08:01] says God is not
[1:08:04] happy with
[1:08:07] somebody that H hasn't got any
[1:08:12] faith why is
[1:08:15] it because you haven't seen
[1:08:18] God with your natural
[1:08:22] eyes you haven't seen heaven
[1:08:26] with your natural
[1:08:28] eyes are we together and the word of God
[1:08:32] you receive it by
[1:08:34] faith you don't receive it by
[1:08:37] understanding no you receive it by
[1:08:40] faith so now that Faith must move
[1:08:45] on it's a faith that move to the
[1:08:50] faith until you reach
[1:08:53] Perfection Paul says
[1:08:56] we preach these
[1:08:58] things to the perfect
[1:09:02] people now your
[1:09:04] Perfection is your
[1:09:08] Zen because when God descend descend to
[1:09:13] a perfect
[1:09:15] person that's why the Bible says be ye
[1:09:19] therefore
[1:09:21] perfect as your father in Heaven
[1:09:25] so the perfect
[1:09:27] father will descend to a perfect
[1:09:32] person and now when it Des sent to a
[1:09:35] perfect
[1:09:37] person then you are at the
[1:09:40] Zen you are a minor God you are now a
[1:09:45] potential
[1:09:47] God you know all the mysteries of
[1:09:51] God are we together amen now the the
[1:09:55] highest point
[1:09:57] then let's give an
[1:10:00] example by
[1:10:02] Matthew there's a there's a scripture in
[1:10:05] the in the Book of Matthew chapter
[1:10:09] 4 in verse
[1:10:14] 5 Matthew 4:
[1:10:18] 5
[1:10:20] uh just read it my brother verse five
[1:10:24] only then then the devil taketh him up
[1:10:27] into the holy city and Seth him on a
[1:10:30] pinnacle of the
[1:10:33] temple so now it's it's verse four and
[1:10:36] five verse four I mean chapter 4 vers 5
[1:10:40] vers 5 yes yeah it says now the
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:46] devil
[1:10:49] uh let me uh check it also here amen
[1:10:54] Matthew four sorry or there it is then
[1:10:58] the
[1:11:00] devil take him into the holy
[1:11:05] city but let's start from from from the
[1:11:08] first
[1:11:10] verse from verse one from verse one yeah
[1:11:13] then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into
[1:11:17] the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:11:19] devil and when he had fasted 40 days and
[1:11:22] 40 nights he was after what and hungered
[1:11:26] and when the tempter came to him he said
[1:11:31] if thou be the Son of God command that
[1:11:33] these Stones be made bread but he
[1:11:36] answered and said it is written men
[1:11:39] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:11:42] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:11:44] mouth of God all right fine now when
[1:11:48] Jesus was
[1:11:53] tempted the Bible
[1:11:57] says it's after he has
[1:12:02] fasted 40 days and 40
[1:12:07] nights and then that's when the tempter
[1:12:12] came and then it says
[1:12:15] now when the tempter came to
[1:12:20] him then he started tempting him
[1:12:26] after the
[1:12:28] fasting after the
[1:12:31] praying after regaining spiritual
[1:12:37] strength now the
[1:12:40] people that need to be
[1:12:44] tempted in the time that we are
[1:12:47] living remember that we are in the last
[1:12:51] days why why are we saying these are the
[1:12:54] last days
[1:12:57] that is the end of the Gentile
[1:13:02] time God is about to go to the
[1:13:08] Jews now we are the
[1:13:13] Gentiles now we are the
[1:13:17] bride and we are the
[1:13:22] threat you are the threat to the
[1:13:28] devil
[1:13:30] because there's nothing that the devil
[1:13:32] can do to
[1:13:37] you there's no
[1:13:40] way that he can engage
[1:13:45] you because you are the
[1:13:49] Perfection now being the
[1:13:54] perfection you determine his
[1:14:02] time when the nearer the Rapture
[1:14:09] comes the the the more the devil
[1:14:16] trembles because he GED himself by
[1:14:21] you you see amen once you reach the
[1:14:26] because you are the
[1:14:28] Perfection it means now he's nearer to
[1:14:31] the Lake of
[1:14:34] Fire when he look at
[1:14:37] you even if he knows that there's
[1:14:39] nothing that he can
[1:14:41] do and now here's our Lord Jesus
[1:14:45] Christ he knew
[1:14:47] exactly why he was
[1:14:51] there he knew he know he knew him
[1:14:56] from
[1:14:58] eternity right amen and then you know
[1:15:01] why he was
[1:15:03] here now the Temptation that he was
[1:15:08] doing he knows very well that he
[1:15:10] wouldn't
[1:15:12] succeed he was a threat to
[1:15:18] him because he came now you will see
[1:15:22] that now after that
[1:15:25] what
[1:15:27] happened I would like us to okay now it
[1:15:32] then the
[1:15:33] devil take him up into the holy
[1:15:38] city now what is the holy
[1:15:43] city the prophet says the holy city is
[1:15:46] New
[1:15:47] [Music]
[1:15:51] Jerusalem so now there was a new there
[1:15:54] was Jerusalem
[1:15:58] City and then which
[1:16:01] types the holy
[1:16:05] city and it is said that when
[1:16:10] Abraham was looking for a
[1:16:14] city he met
[1:16:17] MC the prince of that
[1:16:20] City are are we
[1:16:22] together now he took him
[1:16:27] there and seted him on a pinnacle of the
[1:16:32] temple the highest point of
[1:16:37] the because he
[1:16:41] wanted to to to to bring him
[1:16:47] down to take him out of his
[1:16:52] position so that he could would throw
[1:16:55] him
[1:16:56] down now remember this is a
[1:17:02] tempation is just tempting him so now
[1:17:06] you
[1:17:08] also brother Bram
[1:17:12] says
[1:17:14] uh before the The Squeeze
[1:17:18] come there will be a
[1:17:22] Temptation it says the bride will be
[1:17:26] tempted okay we'll we'll we'll we'll
[1:17:28] read that one but what what I'm showing
[1:17:31] you
[1:17:32] now is that
[1:17:34] now
[1:17:37] uh there is a highest
[1:17:42] point and the more you reach the highest
[1:17:46] point remember here the Bible
[1:17:51] say he after that
[1:17:56] I mean Jesus knew that now
[1:18:00] John was now
[1:18:03] arrested right now he must now start his
[1:18:10] ministry because John the
[1:18:12] Baptist was for running
[1:18:16] Jesus the
[1:18:18] Messiah
[1:18:20] now there was H uh the crossing over
[1:18:27] John
[1:18:29] Ministry was finished the ministry of
[1:18:35] Jesus if you could you could what you
[1:18:40] call let's go to verse uh
[1:18:44] uh
[1:18:46] 12 Matthew 4:12 oh start start from 11
[1:18:51] where he failed we we don't care about
[1:18:54] the other things but he failed verse
[1:18:58] 11 then the devil leave him and behold
[1:19:02] Angels Came and ministered unto him you
[1:19:04] see after he tried to tempt him tempt
[1:19:12] him he just says to
[1:19:16] him get
[1:19:19] thee you
[1:19:21] Satan for it is written thou shall
[1:19:25] Worship the
[1:19:26] Lord thy God and him only
[1:19:32] thou him only shall thou
[1:19:36] serve then the
[1:19:38] devil leave leave him right and
[1:19:43] behold Angels
[1:19:45] Came and ministered unto
[1:19:49] him right that is
[1:19:51] why if you check the Church
[1:19:57] ages there are always
[1:20:01] Overcomers from the first church
[1:20:05] age uh can I have that uh slide Brothers
[1:20:11] the church
[1:20:12] ages now you can
[1:20:16] never get a
[1:20:19] crown without fighting
[1:20:22] [Music]
[1:20:25] you can never be called an
[1:20:29] overcomer without winning a
[1:20:35] battle are we together so there's a
[1:20:38] slide of change ages yeah that's the one
[1:20:42] that if if you look at
[1:20:44] that that
[1:20:47] slide each and every CH
[1:20:52] age there's an overcomer
[1:20:56] right amen there's a group that I will
[1:21:00] quote here which are called the
[1:21:04] Overcomers now we are at the last stage
[1:21:08] age we are
[1:21:10] called the
[1:21:12] Overcomers but you can
[1:21:15] never be an
[1:21:17] overcomer if you have
[1:21:20] not fought and win a battle
[1:21:26] are we together amen so our
[1:21:30] God our Lord Jesus
[1:21:33] Christ was
[1:21:35] tempted and he
[1:21:38] overcame and then the
[1:21:40] Angels Came and ministered unto
[1:21:44] him then verse 12
[1:21:48] brother now when Jesus had heard that
[1:21:51] John was cast into prison he departed
[1:21:54] into gal 13 and leaving Nazareth he came
[1:21:58] and dwelt in capernum which is upon the
[1:22:01] Sea Coast in the borders of zabulon and
[1:22:05] Ne
[1:22:06] Nepal that it might be fulfilled which
[1:22:09] was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying
[1:22:13] the land of Zebulon and the land of
[1:22:16] nepalm by the way of the sea Beyond
[1:22:19] Jordan Galilee of the
[1:22:21] Gentiles the people which said in
[1:22:24] Darkness saw great light and to them
[1:22:27] which set in the regions and shadows of
[1:22:30] death light is sprung up now the
[1:22:34] important verse is verse 17 listen to
[1:22:36] that
[1:22:39] one it says from that time Jesus began
[1:22:43] to preach you see amen from that time
[1:22:47] Jesus
[1:22:49] waited
[1:22:51] until John dispensation was full
[1:22:58] now after it was
[1:23:00] fulfilled then he was in
[1:23:04] power there could not be two of them at
[1:23:07] the same
[1:23:10] time because John would always point at
[1:23:14] him and say there is the Lamb of God but
[1:23:18] now that didn't need an
[1:23:22] understanding it needed a revelation
[1:23:25] because when he says there is a lamb of
[1:23:29] God they saw
[1:23:31] Jesus the son of Joseph and Mary so they
[1:23:36] could not
[1:23:38] understand now after
[1:23:41] John Ministry has expired then
[1:23:46] Jesus began now to
[1:23:51] preach right amen
[1:23:54] now Verse
[1:23:59] 18 says and Jesus walking by the Sea of
[1:24:02] Galilee saw two Brethren Simon called
[1:24:06] Peter and Andrew his brother casting a
[1:24:10] net into the sea for they were
[1:24:13] fishes and he said unto them follow me
[1:24:17] and I will make you fishes of me and
[1:24:19] they straightway left their Nets and
[1:24:21] followed him now he didn't preach any
[1:24:25] seron
[1:24:26] to he just said follow
[1:24:29] [Music]
[1:24:30] me now where was the
[1:24:35] magnet I mean a man cannot just pass
[1:24:39] by and say follow me
[1:24:42] follow you
[1:24:44] see
[1:24:46] like
[1:24:48] Elijah he just touched
[1:24:51] Elisha he didn't say any word he just
[1:24:54] touched him and move
[1:24:57] on and
[1:24:59] Elisha said wait for me and what did he
[1:25:05] do he took his
[1:25:10] oxen and what did he do I think he made
[1:25:12] a bright
[1:25:15] Place yeah I said no these are useless
[1:25:18] May the bra
[1:25:21] people
[1:25:22] because he have seen the value of his
[1:25:29] life
[1:25:31] Peter and his brother here they did not
[1:25:34] question
[1:25:37] Jesus you see now if you are
[1:25:40] predestinated you just need a
[1:25:44] touch once you you see that touch and
[1:25:48] only he goes because the
[1:25:52] ministry it has got its own
[1:25:56] power and it has got its own
[1:25:59] people I will show you
[1:26:02] here you don't have to
[1:26:05] struggle
[1:26:06] no you preach the
[1:26:10] word that comes out of
[1:26:13] him and then it will not come for
[1:26:18] void it will
[1:26:20] bring what God had said
[1:26:24] so you you don't have to be
[1:26:28] scared who are
[1:26:31] you
[1:26:33] no right now what happened
[1:26:37] again verse 21 verse 21 and going on
[1:26:41] from then he saw another two Brethren
[1:26:44] James the son of zebede and John his
[1:26:48] brother in a sheep with zebede their
[1:26:51] father mening their Nets and he called
[1:26:53] them yeah and they immediately left the
[1:26:56] sheep and their father and followed him
[1:26:58] look at
[1:27:00] that and the
[1:27:02] father didn't say hi you boys where are
[1:27:05] you
[1:27:06] going no it it is a thing look your your
[1:27:11] your your your your your predestinated
[1:27:15] life it's from eternity to
[1:27:21] ET there there's nothing that's going to
[1:27:23] be an obstacle on your spiritual
[1:27:29] life there's nothing that is going you
[1:27:32] going to fear
[1:27:34] about that is why an
[1:27:37] angel when the angel comes to brother
[1:27:40] B he says fear not and when an angel
[1:27:44] comes to
[1:27:45] Daniel he says fear
[1:27:47] not you don't have to
[1:27:51] meditate no it's what you are
[1:27:55] you are
[1:27:58] predestinated now these boys their
[1:28:01] father didn't
[1:28:04] say they are
[1:28:09] disrespectful they just leave me with
[1:28:10] the job the father had an understanding
[1:28:15] that they met the
[1:28:18] master so there's a there's a
[1:28:21] pool now when we speak about the third
[1:28:23] pool
[1:28:25] we speaking about something that pulls
[1:28:28] you it it has a pool in
[1:28:32] itself you won't resist it and there
[1:28:35] will be no
[1:28:37] obstacle there's nothing that will stand
[1:28:39] between
[1:28:40] you you are from eternity we are going
[1:28:44] to Eternity it's a ring of
[1:28:49] Eternity that's how you
[1:28:51] are are we together amen
[1:28:57] now
[1:28:59] remember when our Lord Jesus
[1:29:02] Christ went to pray and
[1:29:07] fasted listen to what it
[1:29:10] says verse one verse one on on on the
[1:29:13] first Matthew chapter 4 Matthew 4 verse
[1:29:17] one read verse one then was Jesus led up
[1:29:21] of the spirit Into the Wilderness he was
[1:29:23] led
[1:29:26] that is the beginning of his
[1:29:28] ministry the spirit led
[1:29:32] him
[1:29:35] yeah and he was led to be
[1:29:40] tempted now whoever was tempting
[1:29:45] him was tempting the
[1:29:47] spirit and whoever is tempting
[1:29:51] you is tempting the spirit that is
[1:29:55] he's not tempting
[1:29:57] you as an individual he's tempting the
[1:30:02] owner the life that is in
[1:30:05] you if the life that is in you is an
[1:30:09] eternal
[1:30:10] life there's no way that you'll be
[1:30:18] tempted now
[1:30:20] until he was changing Sports
[1:30:24] now our Lord Jesus
[1:30:26] Christ was showing
[1:30:28] him that he is the master he can take
[1:30:32] him to any
[1:30:34] position and you as the
[1:30:37] bride the devil you can challenge him on
[1:30:42] any
[1:30:43] ground from any
[1:30:46] position
[1:30:48] because he that is in
[1:30:51] you is greater than the one that in
[1:30:55] the you can challenge him in any
[1:30:59] position look what the devil
[1:31:03] did he took
[1:31:06] him uh to the holy
[1:31:09] city to the
[1:31:11] Pinnacle still he
[1:31:14] failed verse 8 verse
[1:31:18] 8 again the devil taken him up in into
[1:31:23] an exceeding high mountain and showed
[1:31:26] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[1:31:28] the glory of them so he keeps on taking
[1:31:32] him to the
[1:31:33] higher not
[1:31:35] knowing that the
[1:31:38] Zen the highest point that's why he sees
[1:31:41] everything now because he was the
[1:31:44] creator of all those
[1:31:46] things
[1:31:48] now if the word is in
[1:31:51] you that you know what to do
[1:31:54] the word is to speak things into
[1:31:58] existence and when you speak things into
[1:32:01] existence nobody can tempt you about
[1:32:06] your
[1:32:07] things because
[1:32:10] you are the
[1:32:12] word you cannot temp the word because
[1:32:16] the word is the
[1:32:18] creator he created everything by his
[1:32:21] way in the beginning God created heaven
[1:32:24] and Earth by his way so now everything
[1:32:29] that is there was created by Him there's
[1:32:33] nothing that will tempt
[1:32:35] you because you were there when they
[1:32:38] were when it was
[1:32:41] cre are we together
[1:32:44] amen
[1:32:46] so we reading verse verse
[1:32:50] 8 we read verse we read verse 8
[1:32:54] okay come again verse eight verse eight
[1:32:58] yes let's
[1:33:00] go to chapter 5 go chapter 5
[1:33:05] Matthew uh verse one verse
[1:33:09] one and seeing the multitudes he went up
[1:33:13] into a mountain and when he was set his
[1:33:16] disciples came unto
[1:33:18] him and he opened his mouth and taught
[1:33:22] them okay fine now
[1:33:25] his
[1:33:26] ministry
[1:33:28] started where did his ministry
[1:33:32] start where was the
[1:33:35] venue says and seeing the
[1:33:39] multitudes he went up into the
[1:33:41] mountain why didn't you preach to them
[1:33:44] right
[1:33:46] there because now his his his his
[1:33:50] ministry is on upper level
[1:33:56] so he took them to the upper
[1:33:59] level he took them to the
[1:34:03] Zen seeing the
[1:34:05] multitudes he went up into a
[1:34:10] mountain when he was
[1:34:12] said then his disciples came unto
[1:34:16] him then he started teaching
[1:34:19] them now that's what I want to I want
[1:34:23] ask to
[1:34:26] Fellowship the the
[1:34:30] zeni which is the point of
[1:34:34] Interest now that you
[1:34:37] know who you are we are right at the
[1:34:41] Zen then we can go and go back to jeel
[1:34:48] now we have read
[1:34:51] jeel chapter 2 chapter 2 verse
[1:34:58] 28
[1:35:00] uh it says
[1:35:04] here and it shall come to
[1:35:08] pass after that I will pour out my
[1:35:11] spirit upon All
[1:35:16] Flesh your old men
[1:35:23] dream
[1:35:27] dreams your young
[1:35:31] man uh
[1:35:35] shall see
[1:35:39] Visions your
[1:35:42] daughters shall Pro
[1:35:46] prophesy remember don't
[1:35:49] forget that uh you
[1:35:55] are only be able to see the
[1:36:00] past and the
[1:36:03] future through the
[1:36:05] Zen when you are at the
[1:36:08] Zen you look at the
[1:36:11] past you look at the
[1:36:14] future you are
[1:36:16] here your presence is
[1:36:20] here you only able to see the past and
[1:36:25] the
[1:36:27] future through your
[1:36:29] presence it all depends where you
[1:36:34] stand now uh the revelation of the
[1:36:38] seventh
[1:36:40] SE is the Zenit
[1:36:43] point now you understand when I say this
[1:36:45] the seven SE is the Zenit
[1:36:49] point because you look at things as the
[1:36:52] minor God
[1:36:55] all right we had the
[1:36:59] past and we have the
[1:37:02] present and we will have our
[1:37:05] future all
[1:37:09] prophecies pointing to the
[1:37:13] future but what happened is that
[1:37:17] now the
[1:37:20] Prophecies of the
[1:37:22] past were pointing to
[1:37:27] us Isaiah
[1:37:30] isah that is a
[1:37:33] prophet Prophet says a virgin shall
[1:37:37] conceive and bear a
[1:37:40] son that is a
[1:37:43] prophet which was pointing to the Future
[1:37:46] during the time of
[1:37:50] Isaiah it was a prophecy
[1:37:53] pointing to the
[1:37:56] Future and then the Virgin
[1:38:02] conceived when the Virgin
[1:38:04] conceived and bear a
[1:38:07] son there was
[1:38:09] prophecies that were pointing to the
[1:38:13] Future which when the the Virgin
[1:38:16] conceived it was
[1:38:18] a a presence during that time
[1:38:24] are we together amen it's a
[1:38:27] fulfillment of the
[1:38:30] prophecy right then it's pointing
[1:38:33] forward and then when the Messiah
[1:38:36] comes then he
[1:38:38] says I will send
[1:38:41] you he says no these things that I'm
[1:38:43] telling
[1:38:45] you you won't be able to
[1:38:48] carry I will send you a
[1:38:51] comforter you see is pointing to a
[1:38:54] future I will send you a
[1:38:57] comfort you now present
[1:39:00] here wait for the
[1:39:05] comforter those who were standing it was
[1:39:07] during their their
[1:39:10] presence they could see the
[1:39:12] past they could see the present and they
[1:39:16] were waiting for the
[1:39:18] future are we together amen and then
[1:39:22] when
[1:39:23] the comforter
[1:39:26] comes it can be a finished
[1:39:30] work because there are
[1:39:34] prophecies there are
[1:39:36] dreams are we
[1:39:39] together and there are
[1:39:41] visions that are pointing to the
[1:39:45] Future now let let's let's let's go into
[1:39:49] that let's take for
[1:39:51] instance Genesis
[1:39:56] 13 uh let's
[1:39:59] read verse 14 my brother 14 15 16 up to
[1:40:04] 17 yes Genesis 13 verse 14 to
[1:40:09] 17 remember we have our
[1:40:14] past and uh we always say may the Lord
[1:40:18] bless our past spiritual fathers
[1:40:25] who
[1:40:27] vigorously PVE the
[1:40:32] way because now for us who are the last
[1:40:36] in the
[1:40:39] race remember we are the last in the
[1:40:49] race uh in the race there is what they
[1:40:52] call
[1:40:55] relay there's a
[1:40:58] one that begins
[1:41:03] race he start with a very very fast
[1:41:09] space and on and on and on and
[1:41:12] on but the last
[1:41:15] one is the one that have to win the the
[1:41:21] race and then you cannot put a
[1:41:24] person that you know that is
[1:41:29] slow to be the last
[1:41:32] Runner because during
[1:41:34] the the race itself how has the pon go
[1:41:39] from one person to
[1:41:41] another there are those that have got
[1:41:44] stamina but they are not
[1:41:47] fast there could be a
[1:41:49] way that they open up a
[1:41:52] gap but the last one must close all the
[1:41:58] gaps you see now you are the
[1:42:01] one that have to close all the
[1:42:05] gaps and run as fast as you
[1:42:11] can and you cannot be the last
[1:42:15] Runner if you don't have the right
[1:42:21] pace you are put here as the last Runner
[1:42:26] because you can make
[1:42:28] [Applause]
[1:42:29] it see and you should know that you can
[1:42:34] make it and you will make
[1:42:37] it are we together
[1:42:41] amen don't lose the
[1:42:45] P right amen now you were still reading
[1:42:48] my brother Genesis chter 13 yes from
[1:42:51] verse 14 m
[1:42:53] and the Lord said unto Abraham after
[1:42:56] that Lord was separated from him lift up
[1:42:59] now thine eyes and look from the place
[1:43:02] where thou art northward and Southward
[1:43:05] and Eastward and Westward for all the
[1:43:08] land which thou seest to thee will I
[1:43:10] give it and to thy seed forever and I
[1:43:14] will make thy seed as the dust of the
[1:43:16] earth so that if a man can number the
[1:43:19] dust of the earth then shall they thy
[1:43:21] seat also be numbered
[1:43:25] verse 17 arise walk through the land in
[1:43:28] the length of it and in the bread of it
[1:43:31] for I will give it unto you yeah now
[1:43:36] here is a
[1:43:40] prophecy
[1:43:42] God is promising
[1:43:45] Abraham in verse 14 he
[1:43:49] says he says look from the place where
[1:43:53] you
[1:43:56] are you look
[1:44:00] northwards as far as your eyes could
[1:44:05] go that's your
[1:44:07] place you look to the
[1:44:10] South as far as your eyes could
[1:44:14] see that is your place you look to the
[1:44:18] west and the East like
[1:44:23] is a
[1:44:25] promise right
[1:44:27] amen and then it says now verse 15 verse
[1:44:31] 15 for all the land which thou
[1:44:36] seest I will give
[1:44:39] it
[1:44:42] forever
[1:44:44] now when
[1:44:46] uh
[1:44:48] God or
[1:44:51] Moses took the children children of
[1:44:55] Israel to the promised
[1:44:59] land the way
[1:45:03] people there were people that can
[1:45:07] claim this is our
[1:45:10] place but now what what God
[1:45:14] do is that now
[1:45:16] uh
[1:45:19] after the dispensations of Noah
[1:45:26] look God wanted people that can worship
[1:45:29] Him in truth and in
[1:45:33] spirit when it
[1:45:35] destroyed the world during the time of
[1:45:38] Noah it it it was
[1:45:41] because people could not worship him as
[1:45:45] he
[1:45:47] wishes so he destroyed
[1:45:50] them because he created heaven and earth
[1:45:55] this is his
[1:45:56] place he want his people to dwell
[1:46:00] here then there comes the era of Noah's
[1:46:05] children H Shem and
[1:46:10] jaff and you name
[1:46:12] it and also during that
[1:46:15] time people started doing their
[1:46:19] thing until he called Abraham
[1:46:23] he said out of you I want people that
[1:46:26] will worship
[1:46:28] me
[1:46:30] anybody that does not worship me this is
[1:46:34] my
[1:46:35] place I get rid of
[1:46:38] him I'm giving you this place because
[1:46:41] it's
[1:46:43] mine are we together amen so he met
[1:46:48] Abraham and spoke to
[1:46:50] Abraham and he was with one
[1:46:55] is an is an
[1:47:00] angel is a judgment
[1:47:04] Angel when God want to
[1:47:07] destroy he
[1:47:10] send he controls all the
[1:47:16] water worwood worwood so is an
[1:47:20] investigating judgment angel
[1:47:26] you see so now he
[1:47:30] says go and
[1:47:32] Destroy because he's got
[1:47:37] mwood he's
[1:47:40] got who's that again Gabriel he's got
[1:47:44] Gabriel are we together so those there's
[1:47:47] lot of angels
[1:47:49] there but then what I'm trying to say to
[1:47:52] you
[1:47:53] is that now that was his
[1:47:56] place and he will place his people where
[1:47:59] he
[1:48:02] wants there were people
[1:48:05] there that is why
[1:48:08] Caleb couldn't see a
[1:48:12] defeat there were giants of
[1:48:16] course and
[1:48:19] Caleb pointed hebon
[1:48:23] Heron was occupied by
[1:48:27] Giants and big walls and then he said
[1:48:30] now I want that's
[1:48:34] mine he was not seeing the
[1:48:37] giant he was seeing his
[1:48:40] place that God has revealed unto
[1:48:44] him it's it's like
[1:48:47] yourself you don't see a threat
[1:48:50] here you see what God has promised
[1:48:56] you now what what he put in the heart of
[1:49:00] Abraham and his seed remember he says
[1:49:05] Abraham and his seed in verse
[1:49:10] 16 now to
[1:49:13] Abraham and his Seed where the promises
[1:49:18] made then it continues and says no it's
[1:49:21] Galatians sorry Ians 3:16 I'm
[1:49:26] reading Galatians
[1:49:34] 3:16 now he he separates now the seed
[1:49:40] from the
[1:49:43] seeds now to
[1:49:46] Abraham and his
[1:49:49] seed Not seeds seed
[1:49:54] where the promise I where the promise
[1:49:58] made and he continues and says he said
[1:50:04] not and to the
[1:50:07] seats I don't know whether you
[1:50:09] understand it now amen as
[1:50:12] many but as of
[1:50:15] one to thy
[1:50:18] seed which is Christ
[1:50:22] you see amen now there is a physical
[1:50:26] seat of
[1:50:29] Abraham there is a spiritual seed of
[1:50:33] ab now the spiritual Seed of
[1:50:36] Abraham is
[1:50:38] Christ now you are the Seed of
[1:50:42] Abraham what makes you the Seed of
[1:50:45] Abraham it's because you are
[1:50:50] Christ why do we say you are
[1:50:54] Christ it's because the word is now in
[1:50:59] you the word has made you
[1:51:02] Christ because uh the word the Bible
[1:51:06] says in the beginning was the
[1:51:08] word the word was with God the Word was
[1:51:14] God now the Word was
[1:51:17] God now where is that we
[1:51:20] now it's in you
[1:51:23] what is the difference between Christ
[1:51:25] and the
[1:51:28] we when God unfolds
[1:51:31] himself God was was a
[1:51:34] spirit or it was seven rainbow
[1:51:38] color and when they come
[1:51:41] together they formed a pillar of
[1:51:44] fire which is called
[1:51:46] logos that's the one Moses
[1:51:49] saw in the burning bush
[1:51:53] if you read Exodus chapter
[1:51:55] 3 don't go to it you'll read it at home
[1:51:59] is that verse
[1:52:01] two
[1:52:03] says God spoke from the pillar of
[1:52:08] fire verse four says the angel of the
[1:52:12] Lord spoke from the pillar
[1:52:15] of now God can take a
[1:52:18] form and become an angel so when God
[1:52:24] being the seven rainbow
[1:52:27] colors came together and then it became
[1:52:31] the
[1:52:33] logos now what is logos it's still
[1:52:38] God the prophet says logos is the Son of
[1:52:44] God are we together in order that you
[1:52:47] should see
[1:52:48] God see the pillar of
[1:52:50] fire now the pillar
[1:52:53] fire which is God
[1:52:55] himself still the we and
[1:53:00] Christ is the anointed one it's God in a
[1:53:05] form of a
[1:53:07] spirit when the word of God comes to
[1:53:10] you it's the spirit of God that comes to
[1:53:14] you the spirit of God
[1:53:18] forms it's a seed it's planted in your
[1:53:22] seed
[1:53:25] germinates and form
[1:53:28] Christ who is a
[1:53:31] spirit now it forms Christ who is a
[1:53:37] spirit that is why
[1:53:39] now it says you are the Seed of
[1:53:43] Abraham which is
[1:53:46] Christ you are that
[1:53:48] seed there is a natural seed
[1:53:52] which are the the sons of
[1:53:55] Jacob which is the Seed of
[1:53:58] Abraham seeds of
[1:54:01] Abraham are we
[1:54:04] together
[1:54:07] so
[1:54:09] God took
[1:54:11] Abraham and promised
[1:54:13] him that was a to to to the
[1:54:19] Israelites that was the past
[1:54:23] now the manifestation of the
[1:54:28] past uh it's like when there is a
[1:54:33] prophecy the prophet that
[1:54:37] prophesies he prophesies things
[1:54:40] according to the way he sees
[1:54:44] them but as time goes
[1:54:47] on things
[1:54:50] changes you know remember he said
[1:54:56] Israel will be scattered throughout the
[1:55:00] world but he will come back in the wings
[1:55:03] of an
[1:55:05] eagle it's because the the the
[1:55:08] prophet that saw that
[1:55:11] Vision he saw an
[1:55:13] aeroplane and there were no aeroplanes
[1:55:16] that there were donkeys to
[1:55:18] that so to him it was just an eagle
[1:55:23] are we together amen now the
[1:55:27] prophecies that were made during the
[1:55:29] time of
[1:55:31] Abraham some of
[1:55:33] them we could see them as we are
[1:55:36] preparing for the
[1:55:39] Rapture as things going to the end of
[1:55:42] our our our
[1:55:45] dispensation and those things are
[1:55:47] showing
[1:55:49] up that is why now
[1:55:52] uh let's go back
[1:55:54] again to Genesis Chapter
[1:55:59] 18 so we have read here now it says now
[1:56:05] God took him to a certain
[1:56:09] level took him to a certain
[1:56:12] level to a certain
[1:56:15] height that is the spiritual
[1:56:20] height and gave him a
[1:56:23] prophecy now it
[1:56:27] depends on
[1:56:29] where when did you receive the
[1:56:35] promise now the the
[1:56:39] promise will never uh
[1:56:44] lose its
[1:56:46] power and its
[1:56:48] level it will move along that level
[1:56:53] it it will never be a weak
[1:56:57] prophecy and it will never uh be in
[1:57:03] incarnated to a weak
[1:57:06] person if
[1:57:08] God prophesied about
[1:57:11] you the prophecy comes from
[1:57:14] God it won't go to a weak
[1:57:16] person that will disbelieve
[1:57:20] it because it from God it goes to a
[1:57:24] person that comes from God that
[1:57:27] descended from God it will keep its
[1:57:32] strength it will it will not lose its
[1:57:35] strength as time goes
[1:57:37] on as the time goes on it will gain its
[1:57:43] strength right amen now here it
[1:57:47] is let's go to uh Genesis 16
[1:57:52] Genesis I mean 18 verse 16 up to
[1:57:57] 18 Genesis 18 verse 16 to
[1:58:04] 18 and the men rose up from fence and
[1:58:07] looked toward Sodom and Abraham went
[1:58:10] with them to bring them on the way and
[1:58:13] the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham
[1:58:16] that thing which I do seeing that
[1:58:18] Abraham shall surely become a Great and
[1:58:21] Mighty nation and all the nations of the
[1:58:24] Earth shall be blessed in him you hear
[1:58:27] what it
[1:58:28] says all all the
[1:58:33] nations of the Earth shall be blessed in
[1:58:38] him all the nations
[1:58:41] of that comes from God
[1:58:44] now that is why he said I won't hide
[1:58:49] anything now if he didn't hide anything
[1:58:51] from
[1:58:53] Abraham what about his
[1:58:56] seed which is Christ
[1:58:59] himself never hide anything from
[1:59:03] you because the Bible says but in the
[1:59:07] days of the voice of the seventh
[1:59:12] angel all Mysteries should be finished
[1:59:16] all of
[1:59:18] them now you reject that uh seven
[1:59:24] Angel you reject your
[1:59:27] blessings you cannot reject the
[1:59:31] prophet and receive the
[1:59:35] blessings before you cannot read this
[1:59:39] scripture Revelation
[1:59:43] 10:7 and reject brother
[1:59:46] BR but the Bible says but in the days of
[1:59:51] The Voice
[1:59:53] of the seventh angel the seventh angel
[1:59:56] is brother
[1:59:57] Bren he the one that will reveal the
[2:00:01] Mysteries all the
[2:00:05] days but it says in the days his
[2:00:09] days yeah now his
[2:00:12] ministry is a blessing
[2:00:16] itself but now here's
[2:00:19] ministry as she goes on on the
[2:00:23] ministry the ministry gains
[2:00:27] strength and it gains
[2:00:31] velocity how you get it gains
[2:00:34] power because it it has got different
[2:00:41] pools it's got the
[2:00:44] first and then it shoots again and goes
[2:00:47] to the second and it shoots again it
[2:00:51] goes to the Third
[2:00:52] so it's gaining strength and strength
[2:00:54] and
[2:00:55] strength are we together as it
[2:00:59] reaches the third pool it Cruise now
[2:01:04] Cru are we together
[2:01:06] now it push
[2:01:09] on are we together now we are
[2:01:15] cruising we are cruising we could see
[2:01:18] all
[2:01:19] Dimensions we could see all dis
[2:01:23] we have all the
[2:01:26] power are we
[2:01:29] together that is
[2:01:30] us how you
[2:01:33] get right now the man
[2:01:37] rules when he says the men
[2:01:40] rul it means the two
[2:01:45] angels that were with
[2:01:47] him and and those were angel of judgment
[2:01:54] they rules
[2:01:55] now going to do their
[2:02:01] work and look towards
[2:02:06] Sodom you know
[2:02:08] when When God
[2:02:11] Says
[2:02:13] attack when takes

[2:02:29] Lord after he was
[2:02:32] tempted and overcame the Angels Came and

[2:03:01] you are an
[2:03:02] overcome your angel is always with you
[2:03:07] and your angel is your
[2:03:11] Revelation the power that is in
[2:03:14] you you must know that you have a
[2:03:18] power are together amen it should be new
[2:03:22] [Applause]
[2:03:23] right
[2:03:24] amen
[2:03:26] now when
[2:03:30] worwood look at
[2:03:34] Sodom God who was with
[2:03:37] Abraham
[2:03:39] knew that now things are going to
[2:03:42] happen then he said no I won't hide
[2:03:45] anything
[2:03:46] for I'm going to destroy that
[2:03:50] place and God
[2:03:52] will never hide anything from the seed
[2:03:55] of
[2:03:57] ab will never hide anything from
[2:04:00] you no because you in you want do things
[2:04:05] that you don't
[2:04:06] know that you scratch your head and say
[2:04:10] but why God didn't
[2:04:13] tell right amen seeing that abraam shall
[2:04:17] surely become a
[2:04:19] great shall become a great Great and
[2:04:22] Mighty
[2:04:26] Nation now if you go to verse
[2:04:29] 222 says and the men turned their faces
[2:04:33] from then and went towards
[2:04:37] Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the
[2:04:42] [Music]
[2:04:44] Lord now what happened now
[2:04:48] Abraham get up
[2:04:51] in the morning to a place where he stood
[2:04:54] before the
[2:04:57] Lord there was anointing there when he
[2:05:01] stand there he could see
[2:05:05] everything that's why he was
[2:05:07] able to
[2:05:10] see uh that now uh the
[2:05:15] smoke went
[2:05:17] up and then he knew that now
[2:05:21] that was the end of
[2:05:24] s now let's go
[2:05:30] toomy
[2:05:31] uh verse 34 I mean chapter 34
[2:05:35] Deuteronomy chapter
[2:05:37] 34 now I'm I'm just showing you these
[2:05:41] things that
[2:05:43] now the P the
[2:05:46] past the
[2:05:49] present the future you are the only one
[2:05:52] that knows it because you are the last
[2:05:57] Runner Paul was pointing to
[2:06:03] us the Bible
[2:06:05] says some of the
[2:06:08] prophets they wish that they could live
[2:06:10] during
[2:06:14] our because God has shown his
[2:06:19] bride everything
[2:06:22] because his
[2:06:23] bride is in his heart his bride is his
[2:06:30] soul right amen now in the book of
[2:06:36] Deuteronomy let's
[2:06:40] read from verse one up
[2:06:42] to
[2:06:44] 4 vers 1
[2:06:46] to4 and Moses went up from the pl of M
[2:06:51] MO
[2:06:52] unto the mountain of nebble to the top
[2:06:55] of Pisa that is over
[2:06:59] against Jericho and the Lord showed him
[2:07:02] all the land of G gilit unto Dan and all
[2:07:08] Nepali and the land of Ephraim and
[2:07:12] manasse and all the land of Judah unto
[2:07:15] the atos Sea and the South and the plain
[2:07:19] of the valley of Jericho the city of
[2:07:21] palm trees unto Z and the Lord said unto
[2:07:25] him this is the land which i s unto
[2:07:29] Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob saying
[2:07:32] I will give it unto thy seat I have
[2:07:35] caused thee to see it with thine eyes
[2:07:39] but thou shall not go over Fe you see
[2:07:42] now that was the
[2:07:45] Fulfillment of the
[2:07:49] prophecy he promised Abraham
[2:07:52] last time when I was preaching I
[2:07:56] said
[2:07:59] God
[2:08:00] cannot uh make you to uh preach to
[2:08:07] people about something you don't
[2:08:09] know and something that you are guessing
[2:08:13] about are we
[2:08:15] together now and the
[2:08:19] people that are going to cross over
[2:08:24] will be part of the
[2:08:27] ministry because he had
[2:08:31] Moses I mean Moses was shown the
[2:08:36] place and all the way from
[2:08:40] Egypt up
[2:08:42] toades
[2:08:44] Moses was standing before Israel and God
[2:08:51] God will say let me get rid of these
[2:08:54] people and then Moses will say no you
[2:08:56] start by
[2:08:58] me he stand before
[2:09:01] them you know what the Bible
[2:09:04] says let me read you the
[2:09:08] scripture it's a book of uh
[2:09:13] uh yeah it's a book of um
[2:09:17] sorry Hebrews
[2:09:24] uh the book of
[2:09:27] Hebrews uh it
[2:09:29] says
[2:09:33] chapter
[2:09:36] 13 I want you to to to to be with me in
[2:09:40] that
[2:09:42] one let's read verse
[2:09:46] 17 or let's start by verse 5 Hebrews
[2:09:50] chter 13 ver 5
[2:09:51] H let your conversation be without
[2:09:55] covetousness and be content with such
[2:09:58] things as he have for he ha said I will
[2:10:02] never leave thee nor forsake thee then
[2:10:05] jump to seven then verse 7 remember them
[2:10:10] which have the rule over you who have
[2:10:13] spoken unto you the word of God whose
[2:10:16] Faith whose Faith follow considering the
[2:10:20] end of their convers ation now he says
[2:10:23] remember
[2:10:25] them which have the rule over
[2:10:30] you and who has spoken unto
[2:10:34] you who has spoken unto
[2:10:38] you the word of
[2:10:41] God it says remember
[2:10:46] them whose
[2:10:49] faith f
[2:10:54] considering the end of their
[2:10:59] conversation go to verse 17 verse
[2:11:03] 17 obey them that have the rule over
[2:11:07] you so there's somebody that has got
[2:11:10] rule over
[2:11:15] you look okay
[2:11:18] continue obey them that have the rule
[2:11:21] over you and submit yourselves for they
[2:11:24] watch for your souls as they that must
[2:11:27] give account they they watch for your
[2:11:31] soul Moses Moses that is why now he
[2:11:36] considered the
[2:11:40] soul because you will stand between God
[2:11:43] and
[2:11:45] this now a
[2:11:48] pastor is a man that consider your
[2:11:54] soul he he was built like
[2:11:58] that it's not something that happened
[2:12:03] overnight God when he created
[2:12:07] him he knew what he was
[2:12:11] doing now start
[2:12:15] again 17 obey them obey them that have
[2:12:18] the rule over you and submit yourself
[2:12:22] for they watch for your souls as they
[2:12:24] that must give account that they may do
[2:12:27] it with joy they they must give
[2:12:32] account because God make him a
[2:12:36] leader and gave him a spirit and gave
[2:12:40] him a revelation and gave him faith and
[2:12:44] gave him
[2:12:45] virtue and gave him everything now when
[2:12:49] you are a soldier
[2:12:51] you are given
[2:12:52] everything to go and fight and you don't
[2:12:56] use those things then you are caught
[2:12:59] Marshall now when you are a
[2:13:03] pastor you are
[2:13:05] empowered with
[2:13:08] everything and if you don't use
[2:13:12] that then you must give
[2:13:17] account so now when they give account
[2:13:21] they must do it with with joy joy amen
[2:13:25] and not with grief for that is
[2:13:29] unprofitable for
[2:13:32] you if he gives an account about
[2:13:36] you if he he he is not happy about
[2:13:41] you is unprofitable to
[2:13:46] you because he must give must say when
[2:13:48] he look at kosana
[2:13:52] I that is my
[2:13:54] sheep I'm happy about
[2:13:57] him are you together but if he look
[2:14:01] at and
[2:14:05] say then he's doing that with
[2:14:08] G he's not sure about
[2:14:12] you are we together look brother
[2:14:17] Bram said he the pastor will see you
[2:14:23] through and that
[2:14:26] thing is an insult to lot of
[2:14:30] people they say no Jesus not the
[2:14:34] pastor Jesus not not
[2:14:38] fine where is
[2:14:42] Jesus Jesus come as a
[2:14:45] spirit and he comes as a spirit and the
[2:14:49] Bible says we've got fivefold
[2:14:53] ministri
[2:14:56] some
[2:14:58] prophets some pastors I mean
[2:15:03] Apostles some
[2:15:05] apost some you know teachers and
[2:15:09] evangelist no those are the spirits of
[2:15:12] Christ the spirit of Christ if if if you
[2:15:15] want to see
[2:15:17] Christ you see him in that Ministry
[2:15:24] right let's
[2:15:26] continue then I just deated a bit just
[2:15:30] to want to show you that when
[2:15:33] Moses was leading
[2:15:35] them he had a
[2:15:37] vision where he's taking them when your
[2:15:41] pastor is leading
[2:15:44] you he's got a vision of where he's
[2:15:49] taking are we together amen
[2:15:52] right so now you see Moses was shown the
[2:15:57] place and then when he slept he slept
[2:16:00] with joy he has
[2:16:04] arrived it was shown unto
[2:16:06] him say y your ministry ends up here he
[2:16:10] won't go in and he said Hallelujah and
[2:16:14] he went in glory he went in glory
[2:16:18] knowing that he has completed
[2:16:22] his
[2:16:24] dispensation right
[2:16:27] amen uh we had our spiritual
[2:16:32] fathers you know the crossing of the Red
[2:16:37] Sea was to those that were in
[2:16:43] ction all those that were
[2:16:46] inau they were the one that could cross
[2:16:48] the
[2:16:51] because they were
[2:16:53] examined by the
[2:16:55] angel who find them
[2:16:58] worthy because of the blood
[2:17:02] stain that followed the
[2:17:06] commission so they were worthy to cross
[2:17:11] over but if you were not
[2:17:14] worthy you won
[2:17:17] cross that is why Caleb cross
[2:17:24] right now let's go to our
[2:17:28] scripture uh the Bible
[2:17:32] says
[2:17:34] uh they shall dream
[2:17:38] dreams he says you shall
[2:17:42] prophesy that is your
[2:17:45] daughters and the old men shall dream
[2:17:48] dreams and the young men shall see
[2:17:50] vision
[2:17:53] now in this
[2:17:56] book uh I mean the fifth
[2:17:59] seal paragraph paragraph 91 am the the
[2:18:04] the fifth seal I want to
[2:18:07] read something
[2:18:09] about
[2:18:11] the the
[2:18:15] dreams now it says
[2:18:18] here I'll start where he says
[2:18:23] uh six straight
[2:18:28] dreams came exactly with a
[2:18:33] vision a dream interpreted last time I I
[2:18:37] spoke about
[2:18:39] them now he says
[2:18:44] now uh a dream interpreted is a vision
[2:18:52] if you
[2:18:55] dream and then your dream is
[2:18:59] interpreted then you have seen a
[2:19:04] vision because a person may not be born
[2:19:08] with a subconscious to
[2:19:14] stay be awake when he sees it then I'll
[2:19:18] explain that
[2:19:20] then God gots over his subconscious and
[2:19:24] speaks to
[2:19:27] him which he promise that in dreams in
[2:19:31] the last
[2:19:33] days he will visit them now let's go to

[2:20:03] line paragraph
[2:20:07] 32 32 just just to to to say something
[2:20:10] about the the the
[2:20:14] dreams the
[2:20:16] visions and the prophecies
[2:20:21] right paragraph 32 32 and and the Bible
[2:20:26] said in the last days the old man will
[2:20:30] dream
[2:20:32] dreams have you got it
[2:20:37] there the and the Bible said in the last
[2:20:41] days shall the old men I mean the that
[2:20:45] the old men will dream dreams again and
[2:20:48] the young men will see visions now
[2:20:51] perhaps maybe the man that doesn't dream
[2:20:55] a
[2:20:57] dream his subconscious be a way
[2:21:04] back now you've got
[2:21:08] conscious and no no
[2:21:11] conscience and I've got there's a time
[2:21:14] when you are
[2:21:16] cautious you are awake
[2:21:19] yes and then there's a time when you
[2:21:21] sleep and when you when you you you are
[2:21:25] awake you could see things because your
[2:21:29] mind is
[2:21:31] okay but when you are
[2:21:35] asleep all your body parts are
[2:21:40] relaxed and your mind is
[2:21:44] relaxed it's only your subconscious that
[2:21:47] is uh awake
[2:21:53] okay let me just try you what happen
[2:21:56] when you are where are you when you are
[2:21:59] asleep you all sleep yeah there's
[2:22:03] nobody can you tell me where you where
[2:22:06] are you when you
[2:22:08] asleep you're not dead you
[2:22:12] asleep it's because your mind want to
[2:22:17] rest and once your mind rest
[2:22:21] your body your body is
[2:22:23] resting but you it's your subconscious
[2:22:26] now that is
[2:22:29] working but remember your soul does not
[2:22:34] sleep your soul
[2:22:37] travels the real you is your
[2:22:41] soul are we together now when you are
[2:22:46] asleep you dream now what is a dream
[2:22:49] that's why the the the the the the the
[2:22:52] the Bible say I mean the prophet
[2:22:54] says when a dream is interpreted is a
[2:22:59] vision now he says
[2:23:02] now there's conscious there's
[2:23:07] subconscious they next they are next to
[2:23:09] each
[2:23:10] other there are
[2:23:12] people that are
[2:23:15] blessed that they don't
[2:23:18] sleep if they want to see a
[2:23:21] thing they could just see
[2:23:23] it they gifted to
[2:23:26] that there are some other people before
[2:23:29] they could see a thing they must sleep
[2:23:33] and they will dream and times when they
[2:23:36] wake up they know that they had they had
[2:23:39] a
[2:23:40] dream but they can't remember what
[2:23:43] that there are some people that can
[2:23:46] interpret that
[2:23:49] dream now that's where now the Devil
[2:23:52] comes
[2:23:53] in when you are
[2:23:56] asleep he comes now in your
[2:24:02] subconscious when he comes into your
[2:24:05] subconscious you think you are
[2:24:09] dreaming is the
[2:24:11] demon will appear as your
[2:24:15] grandmother or your grandfather or
[2:24:18] whoever it is tell you
[2:24:21] stories and when you wake
[2:24:24] up I've seen my
[2:24:26] grandmother he told me this in he even
[2:24:30] showed
[2:24:31] me a a red R or a white or a blue or
[2:24:38] whatever he said go and buy those
[2:24:40] things and you go and buy
[2:24:43] them are we together or you go to a s
[2:24:50] tell him about your
[2:24:52] dream then he will say no go and buy
[2:24:54] those
[2:24:55] things and then I will initiate
[2:24:58] you in other words I will make you to
[2:25:02] communicate with whoever it
[2:25:06] is but he came to a
[2:25:09] subconscious let me tell you you can be
[2:25:13] strong
[2:25:15] physically you can have dogs in your
[2:25:18] house
[2:25:22] proves and
[2:25:25] gun are we
[2:25:27] together but the spirit
[2:25:30] enters and go to a
[2:25:32] subconscious and beat you
[2:25:36] up that strong man will hear him
[2:25:39] shouting and
[2:25:45] say
[2:25:46] yeah so there's nothing that you can do
[2:25:49] I
[2:25:51] body is asleep and
[2:25:53] everything so now you you're traveling
[2:25:58] Soul it's not strong
[2:26:02] enough cannot protect you look if the
[2:26:06] word of God is in your
[2:26:09] soul and your soul is alive there's not
[2:26:14] demon that will torment you at
[2:26:17] night because your soul becomes the
[2:26:22] word but if your soul is not the word
[2:26:25] and the demon will come as one of the
[2:26:30] member the person who in hell and crying
[2:26:33] in
[2:26:35] the and then it will come in that way
[2:26:39] and then you will start worshiping
[2:26:41] that why you worshiping that worshiping
[2:26:44] a
[2:26:46] demon and you think is one of the me
[2:26:50] members of
[2:26:52] the you will see when somebody
[2:26:56] passes and then they will
[2:27:01] say
[2:27:06] inace they don't know that know they are
[2:27:09] worshiping the know that they are
[2:27:11] worshiping the once a
[2:27:15] person once the the
[2:27:17] spirit the soul
[2:27:20] and the body separates there's
[2:27:25] no either you are in
[2:27:28] Hell or you are in a six
[2:27:32] Dimension now what the prophet says
[2:27:36] here he
[2:27:38] says some are
[2:27:40] born with their conscious and
[2:27:43] subconscious
[2:27:46] together they could see things
[2:27:50] some will
[2:27:52] sleep like he says here now subconscious
[2:27:55] will be way
[2:27:58] back like over
[2:28:00] there
[2:28:02] the that person sleeps real
[2:28:07] sound a dreamer doesn't sleep
[2:28:12] soundly but now the one with
[2:28:14] subconscious way
[2:28:16] back he never get back to it
[2:28:20] he just sleeps
[2:28:24] through are we together
[2:28:29] am I've got this book
[2:28:32] also trying to do God a service
[2:28:36] without
[2:28:40] will then he says
[2:28:43] here he speaks about the for
[2:28:48] knowledge he says now his for knowledge
[2:28:51] has caused him to set in the church and
[2:28:54] in the
[2:28:59] people that's God's for
[2:29:02] knowledge has caused
[2:29:04] him God to set in the
[2:29:08] church and in the
[2:29:10] people certain things that he did not he
[2:29:14] did from the
[2:29:17] beginning when I say and he said in the
[2:29:22] church yeah and in the
[2:29:26] people certain
[2:29:28] things that he did from the
[2:29:32] beginning and then the
[2:29:35] gospel that being preached to the
[2:29:39] age is
[2:29:41] revealed just recent only is only
[2:29:45] revealed to that certain
[2:29:49] people like the seven
[2:29:52] seene is
[2:29:54] revealed to certain
[2:29:57] people the rest of them don't see
[2:30:02] it let me repeat
[2:30:05] that
[2:30:07] and his full
[2:30:10] knowledge caus him to set in the
[2:30:14] church and in the people certain things
[2:30:20] that he did from the
[2:30:23] beginning then the gospel that's
[2:30:26] preached to that
[2:30:29] age is only revealed to that certain
[2:30:37] people are we
[2:30:39] together preach only to that certain
[2:30:44] people the rest of them don't see
[2:30:48] it the seventh SE
[2:30:51] it's for certain
[2:30:52] people the third pool is for certain
[2:30:56] people the rest doesn't
[2:31:00] [Music]
[2:31:02] see that's why they
[2:31:05] say what is this all about what is this
[2:31:08] seven we've been hearing the word of God
[2:31:12] all all of a sudden they come with
[2:31:15] stories it's for certain people
[2:31:21] that's why he
[2:31:23] said Thank thee
[2:31:26] father th is he these
[2:31:29] things from the eyes of the
[2:31:35] wise has Heed These
[2:31:37] Things From The
[2:31:40] Wise let me read thou had Heed These
[2:31:45] Things From the eyes of the
[2:31:47] wise and prudent and reveal it to the
[2:31:52] baby such as you
[2:31:54] Le see that is
[2:31:59] predestination you know that John the
[2:32:03] Baptist was the only one that saw the
[2:32:07] Holy
[2:32:10] Ghost when the spirit descended to
[2:32:15] Jesus there were many
[2:32:17] people John was baptizing
[2:32:21] but he was the only one that
[2:32:25] saw that's certain people he was a
[2:32:28] certain
[2:32:30] person he could see those
[2:32:33] things brother Bram
[2:32:36] says oh yeah let me read it
[2:32:39] here it says I'm reading earnestly
[2:32:42] contending for the faith that was once
[2:32:47] delivered unto the Saints amen
[2:32:51] now he says
[2:32:52] here paragraph
[2:32:56] 22 but John saw the Holy Ghost like a
[2:33:00] dve coming down upon
[2:33:03] you a voice
[2:33:06] saying this is my beloved
[2:33:09] Son in
[2:33:10] whom I am
[2:33:14] pleased God was bearing a
[2:33:17] record there were many people
[2:33:21] but they could not see that it's only
[2:33:23] John
[2:33:25] that's there are many
[2:33:27] people they could not see the seven SE
[2:33:30] it's only the bride that
[2:33:32] can because it's for certain
[2:33:37] people he says again many people that
[2:33:41] see something like this Angel here on
[2:33:45] the
[2:33:48] picture say Ang here on the
[2:33:52] picture somebody
[2:33:57] says they are woring a white man we are
[2:34:01] looking at that
[2:34:04] angel that ring of
[2:34:07] Eternity that
[2:34:10] logos this man is an anointed man of
[2:34:15] God the angel of the Lord
[2:34:20] give
[2:34:22] record or bear
[2:34:25] record when
[2:34:28] God sends you he must bear a
[2:34:33] record so here he Bears a
[2:34:36] record then he says now it's only
[2:34:39] certain
[2:34:41] people that could see this
[2:34:44] Angel here on the
[2:34:47] picture it's been seen by millions of
[2:34:51] people some say
[2:34:56] oh oh no it's just given sometimes to
[2:34:59] certain
[2:35:01] people then he continues and says the
[2:35:04] wise
[2:35:06] men you believe they saw a
[2:35:11] star none of the
[2:35:17] observat they even kept time by the
[2:35:21] Stars nobody else saw
[2:35:25] nothing but it was the wise man it was
[2:35:29] just it was just given to
[2:35:32] them that is why it's just given to
[2:35:36] you you can sit with somebody the whole
[2:35:41] night if it's not given unto
[2:35:44] him he won't see
[2:35:47] it the pastor can preach
[2:35:50] until blood comes out of his
[2:35:54] ear a person that is not given today won
[2:35:59] see it because it's not for
[2:36:04] him when
[2:36:06] Paul was streaking
[2:36:09] down breaking down a light blinded
[2:36:14] him the same
[2:36:16] light the same Pillar of Fire
[2:36:20] that led the children of
[2:36:23] Israel so it's I jesus who stand before
[2:36:29] you but the men with
[2:36:33] him they had nothing they haven't seen
[2:36:39] anything right amen and they were right
[2:36:42] with
[2:36:43] him Soldiers with
[2:36:46] him cars from the temple
[2:36:50] they never had it it's just given to
[2:36:54] some people to see and hear
[2:36:58] things it's given to some
[2:37:01] people to hear things and see
[2:37:06] things not all
[2:37:09] prophets not all the
[2:37:12] apostles not all you not all are
[2:37:17] prophets
[2:37:20] not all are
[2:37:23] Apostles not all of this or
[2:37:27] that but it's
[2:37:30] given those things are born in Us by
[2:37:36] election what say those things are born
[2:37:40] in
[2:37:41] Us by election and if it's not born in
[2:37:45] You by
[2:37:47] election you won't go
[2:37:52] race somewhere
[2:37:54] somehow take a you take another
[2:37:58] Direction how
[2:38:03] geten those things are born in Us by
[2:38:09] election that's why the Bible says gifts
[2:38:12] and calling are
[2:38:19] see gibs and cing are not
[2:38:23] now now what the prophet says
[2:38:27] here uh I always emphasizes on the on
[2:38:31] the thir pool on the
[2:38:35] ministry when the ministry
[2:38:39] changes
[2:38:41] uh they tend to get
[2:38:45] confused like the ministry of brother br
[2:38:50] they could see
[2:38:52] him when the Bible
[2:38:54] says behold I'll send you Elijah the
[2:38:59] prophet no and then he will he will do
[2:39:05] what he will
[2:39:08] turn they could see him turning their
[2:39:12] hearts of the children to their
[2:39:16] fathers then it ends up there but
[2:39:21] when the new commission
[2:39:25] starts it becomes a
[2:39:28] problem look they followed John the
[2:39:32] Baptist oh let's leave John they
[2:39:36] followed
[2:39:38] Moses when now the new commission
[2:39:42] comes which is John the
[2:39:45] Baptist what did they do they cut off
[2:39:49] his
[2:39:52] because he's got a new
[2:39:54] Commission Now his
[2:39:57] disciples followed
[2:40:00] John right when the new commission
[2:40:04] comes that is of Christ they still
[2:40:08] followed
[2:40:10] John until his head was chopped
[2:40:13] off maybe some of them went back to
[2:40:18] fishing they
[2:40:20] disciples follow
[2:40:24] Jesus when now the new commission
[2:40:27] comes because his his his
[2:40:30] ministry was to share his
[2:40:34] brother are we together amen so they
[2:40:37] didn't want him to do that and then when
[2:40:41] now that
[2:40:42] happens they went on for
[2:40:46] fishing are we together amen so now when
[2:40:50] brother
[2:40:53] Bram
[2:40:55] Ministry ended
[2:40:57] up it ended up then comes the ministry
[2:41:01] of the
[2:41:03] Angel because he went
[2:41:06] westwards he met an
[2:41:08] angel and when he comes back it's
[2:41:11] another
[2:41:13] dispensation he got now the ministry of
[2:41:16] an
[2:41:17] angel now people
[2:41:19] are waiting for
[2:41:21] Christ to come and open up the
[2:41:24] book because the Bible says the lamb
[2:41:28] took the
[2:41:30] book right am when now man or the lamb
[2:41:35] himself or Christ himself in a man open
[2:41:39] up that thing then they said no they
[2:41:43] they don't see the changing of the
[2:41:47] ministry now the angel of the
[2:41:50] Lord the notable
[2:41:52] one look remember last time I told you
[2:41:56] that
[2:41:58] brother had a
[2:42:00] dream or a vision one of the
[2:42:04] two then he saw the angel that was
[2:42:07] always behind
[2:42:10] him and the the
[2:42:13] logos going
[2:42:15] to another building
[2:42:19] and the voice
[2:42:21] said I will meet you
[2:42:24] there then that was and then he says no
[2:42:27] that is the fful
[2:42:30] Min are we together now we are not in
[2:42:34] aition
[2:42:39] ch we crossed
[2:42:42] over okay in
[2:42:44] closing can I have uh that slide of the
[2:42:49] church age again the first one just just
[2:42:52] in
[2:42:54] closing are we together now as believe
[2:42:58] the other one the other one the first
[2:43:00] one amen the first
[2:43:03] one it's on the same slide but the first
[2:43:08] one are we
[2:43:10] together if if you don't have then let's
[2:43:12] have the
[2:43:14] last uh slide that we have of the church
[2:43:19] AG now we we should know that now the
[2:43:22] will of
[2:43:24] God is Not
[2:43:27] stagnant even in
[2:43:29] you it's not
[2:43:33] St okay I have this one
[2:43:38] here uh
[2:43:41] yeah the other one brother you you yes
[2:43:45] that's that's the one I
[2:43:46] want no
[2:43:49] what's wrong yeah that's the one I
[2:43:54] want look what the devil is
[2:43:57] doing the first three Church
[2:44:01] ages there was an
[2:44:04] antichrist and the fourth Church
[2:44:08] Age The Very
[2:44:11] Antichrist came a false
[2:44:15] prophet right amen and the fifth six
[2:44:19] Church
[2:44:21] age that
[2:44:23] Antichrist that false
[2:44:26] prophet became a
[2:44:31] VI now the seventh Church
[2:44:35] AG he's the
[2:44:39] Beast right amen the Bible
[2:44:43] says he's a terrible Beast
[2:44:52] Daniel had a dream and
[2:44:55] vision and saw it so we are
[2:45:00] concentrating so we we are over where
[2:45:03] it's written
[2:45:06] love we we cross
[2:45:09] over when we speak about the seven
[2:45:13] SE we speak in another level
[2:45:20] are we
[2:45:22] together so now we were
[2:45:27] saying uh you have
[2:45:31] a a
[2:45:33] soul you have a mind they have a
[2:45:37] conscious and
[2:45:39] subconscious and then they've got a mode
[2:45:42] when you
[2:45:44] soul is in a right mode
[2:45:51] and then it cannot be
[2:45:56] influen by the evil
[2:45:59] spirit because now you
[2:46:03] grew to an
[2:46:05] extend where you
[2:46:08] are are together now here we are
[2:46:13] now the Bible
[2:46:16] says when the devil
[2:46:19] comes in like a
[2:46:21] flood God raises up a
[2:46:25] stand when he comes like an
[2:46:28] antichrist God raises a
[2:46:31] standard when he changes to be false
[2:46:34] prophet God raises an
[2:46:37] anti now there's always
[2:46:39] Overcomers when it becomes a
[2:46:42] VI God raises a
[2:46:45] standard now that they are worshiping
[2:46:49] now remember all the seven Church
[2:46:53] ages are named after different
[2:46:58] cities and these
[2:47:01] cities were
[2:47:03] worshiping the devil they've got images
[2:47:07] that they
[2:47:08] have like the first one they had an
[2:47:10] image of
[2:47:12] Diana they were worshiping
[2:47:15] Diana on and on onia
[2:47:21] they were worshiping
[2:47:23] Ze are we together which is the son of
[2:47:26] the devil no is the Devil
[2:47:29] Himself now in the
[2:47:31] time that you are living
