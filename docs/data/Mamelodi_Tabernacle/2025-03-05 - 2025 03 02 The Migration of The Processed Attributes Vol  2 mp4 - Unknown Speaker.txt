you you uh support [Music] me amen amen God bless you shall we uh read now in the book of uh Joshua chapter 5 I would like us to be to read from uh verse 12 to 16 Joshua 5 verse 12- 16 12- 16 uh I think brother is ready now amen okay and the man assisted on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither have the children of Israel Mana anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him are thou for us of for our adversaries and he said nay but as Captain of the host of the Lord I am now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servant and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua lose thy shoe from off thy feet foot for the place whereon thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so okay let's B ahead brother will uh lead us in prayer we are approaching a very important moment in our [Music] lives for let everyone let every concentration be in the service as you address us oh God and we shall give you all the honor and all the glory in the precious and wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen you you may be seated God bless you okay [Music] okay as I've said we together again you remember last time I I had a title yeah I think we are continue with the same title it will be part two the title was the migration of the process as attributes I'm sure you still I'm sure you still remember that that we we are processed from [Music] God and when we are processed from God that makes us the the the the [Music] attributes now when you are uh the attribute of God there's no way that you can get lost and there is no way that you can miss the Rapture and there is no way that you could do what you don't understand because you are a minor God now now the migration as we explained last time that is the the movement from one part to another like we we we were in him then we become the attributes and you all know what happened in the garden of Ed and then after uh God uh redeemed us then we start our journey back home then we we migrated now you know uh the the the animals they they've got this seasonal migration like I've explained [Music] last they migrate through seasons and we also m we migrate according to the different dispensations and when we we we migrate according to the dispensation each and every dispensation uh it's got a region you migrate from one region of life to another and the reason is what the reason is for the changing of your body because there's another level or region where you will reach that does not necessarily need this for amen now we all have to know uh the the time that we are living in and what is expected of us it's not just a matter of going to the service but you are received and if you are Ace then you are an attribute and then you had to uh produce what you are okay let me take the example that the pastor always gives us he will always uh speak about uh the the the flight because we've read now that when when Joshua crossed the river Jordan he met an angel now after meeting that angel then that angel said I I am the captain of The Host these people that you are leading I am their K so when he is the then now after crossing over the captain took over but the Myer is it was Joshua Contin but actually it was not jhua it was a now brother Brenham brother preached about the seven Church ages the Bible says he was to turn their heart sure we've just sang what you call it song behold I will send you Elijah the great and Dreadful day of the Lord now he will do what not not not hearts a heart one heart now why is it not HS it is because when they were waiting for the holy ghost in the upper room the Bible says they were one mind one heart one spirit now now when you you you speak about the bride you speak about you we not speaking about the bride they are one heart one Spirit one mind that's that's what we are those are the attributes of God when they move when they migrate they migrate being one heart one one Spirit now when we migrate with different Hearts will take different direction and once we take different direction we become vulnerable because we are no more one so now the pastor will always speak about the flight remember now the ministry he is of the captain of the host remember when brother Bram brother preached about the seven churches after that he went what then when he came he came with a new commission new ministry the ministry was of the angel because he went Westward he met an angel right then when he came back the ministry was off that when Joshua crossed over he met an Angel and the ministry became off angel but we see Joshua righten and we see brother saying I am going eastwards to open the se you see amen and the Bible says John cried and then it was said to John Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed not brother the lion of the but then who opened the SS I'm going eastwards to open the SE the Bible says the lamb took the book you see amen now that's where now you see the cream of the Bride exactly what is happening there you you miss that one it's difficult to cross over it's difficult to recognize the ministry of that angel the angel that FW brother are we together and you will miss what brother said have you met you will miss that you will want somebody that you are going to meet physically and you won't find him right amen so now when when he speaks about the flight that is about to take off now he speaks about the the order inside and outside what what was happening outside and what was happening inside when the captain is on the cockpit and then you will only hear the rumbling and the running of engines outside once the C crew can close the door now which means the one that is on outside can't come in the ministry differs outside you hear the rumbling of the engine and the captain now take control he's the one now you'll always see him looking at the dashboard giving instructions to the C checking his departure and cruising time and his Landing time now the captain's Ministry is directed to the Overcomers and the will tell you relax welcome welcome our flight will go like this in in other words he says fear not I am the he will even tell you that we going to find a cross wind he wouldn't say he wouldn't say well we don't know will see whether will arrive because there thunderstorms cross wind we don't know no he will just relax we're going to meet cross but we'll just and those that know they speak very simply no we will do that even when the cross wind comes you will just fasten yourself well we were crossing through and you were cruising through so that that is his ministry the the ministry is fear he he he is the he is in control yeah beautiful now the concentration is now fear not those were taking their relatives to the airport have kissed them and Bing them goodbye they will know what is going on they will be driving home but the one that will be now right inside would have identified his seat number so he will be relaxing concentration on his journey now remember that PO and F is not allowed no there's a special men after you've crossed over there's no no the menu changes it's now another menu we had sisters I think I don't know whether they were going to Cape Town or well they had their crew said no no no BR so now when when when you cross over the ministry changes we we will read that I'm just giving you Direction where we going remember there's a special menu when Israel crossed over she started to eat the fruit of the [Music] land right remember that we we we we we have seven major Visions still remember them now our ministry is this way there was the first major Vision you know that one of molini and the second one was ADF Hitler you know that those were the visions that the prophet saw and the three ISS fism fism naism nism communism communism don't forget the prophet said communism communism uh is the one that will swallow you see and the prophet said Beware and watch the King of the North was referring to right and then from there one we heard the advance of science he saw those things in 19 amen he saw them in 19333 and then the fifth one was a moral problem right and then the sixth one was that beautiful but cruel woman right amen and the last one was the Terrible explosion and then he said he saw de de yeah and then uh the the creators smoke over America so we we have all the guidelines now this Ministry that now is the inside Ministry uh he says now the the last major vision is is the one that America will be in creatures right remember we take uh the Old Testament as a shadow and then we are on the new test we take what happened to the Jews and then how did they they they they they they refused their Messiah and then we come to our site we see how in our time the Lord was rejected now we the Beast is now ready the King of the North need to be provoked because the prophet says behold the King of the North now the King of the North will never Strike unless he's provoked because the bomb is ready the Buton is ready it needs somebody just to press the it needs just people to come and provoke the King of the North is ready need to be provoked those that listen to the news they know that there is provocation and the king of the not keep on saying I will just press a button and destroy you see amen so the major vision needs to be completed but I don't think that will be here yeah the Vatican is ready remember the prophet spoke about America Russia and the vaan those are the three spoke about America is a powerful Nation together Russia is the King of the North that is not history it's what is happening and what is happening about the Vatican they when when when when Russia Russia was fighting which countries what UK Ukraine Ukraine they ask the pope actually what are you saying about it he said I'm seeing two Devils fighting it depends which devil wins but from there on he went now now and open the holy doors those who follows these things the media says Pope Francis Francis open the the Five Holy doors to inaugurate the 2025 Jubilee now I won't say much about remember there are demons that were bound on the river e and the prophet said during the second World War some of them were released then you know what happened in the Holocaust those were those demons now the river euph it's dry when it's try the demons are coming out when when they are coming out somebody's opening doors there's a spirit that must descend when Jesus Christ was with his disciples he said you were I chosen 12 one of you is a devil and then on that day he descended to Judas it was difficult for Judas to shake it off when the spirit descend and the wrong Spirit descend on individual and find a place it's difficult to shake it off especi when you are predestinated for condemnation remember some are predestinated for eternal life some are predestinated for condemnation you see amen okay fine Amen Let Let us then continue now what is the [Music] food uh what is our food today now oh let me first finish with by saying it says now the Vatican is ready as per Vision you know what is that Vision so the king of the not is ready the provokers are ready the bride is ready now everybody has taken his seat number he came down with a book and that book has got names and everybody who calls himself or herself knows his name right amen because he was called by the name right amen now he says here in paragraph 171 in this book uh 70th week of Daniel works of Daniel now these two prophets what will they do mind you now our ministry it's right at the Z we have already crossed over we are waiting for the changing of the body now we cannot change the body without the ministry that will make us to change our that is why we can't go backward I'll read you the scripture of those that uh fail to cross but after after we are gone there are two prophets then the prophet said what will they do it's Moses and Elijah it says they will rise on the sin I believe they are already ready because their Min should be only 3 and a half years after Rapture after Rapture within that three and a half to WRA up their ministry right amen so they ready now I said America is ready vtic is ready ready Russia is ready Russia is ready the bride is ready those that were going to take over after we gone they ready Moses and Elijah they'll tell these Jews their mistake what is their mistake the Bible says they were blinded so that we could be crafted right amen and we were grafted in now we are called the the Gentiles and our time is over amen right amen then he must go back to the Jews those two prophets they will tell the Jews their mistake that you crucified him and out of that Jewish bunch there's to be 144,000 144,000 God will call only 144 14,000 then the prophet continues and say what is it the spirit of Elijah I'm sure you reading there it says the spirit of elij can you see that off it's no it's not o and F it's O and dou F what is the difference o and f o f when it says off it says the spirit of Elijah off the Gentile Church spirit moves off from the Gentile it leaves the Gentiles because the ministry is finished behold I send you Elijah the prophet and then Elijah the prophet has done his job now that Spirit now moves moves now off the Gentiles he will continue right into that Jewish Church go right on in and call Moses right call Moses and he Contin says and he will preach the same message Pentecost to those Jews they rejected the Messiah right amen it will be the same Pentecostal music I mean message that these Jews will preach right over them and they hate those Jews you see when you have the ministry the last Ministry you will be hated because the L Ministry is the one that corners the devil that is the end of him it exposes him right so now they they they supposed to hate them and kill them but they will resurrect they just done remember it's not you who believe the word of God is the word of God in you that believe the word of God is the word of God believing the word of God you are just a carrier that is why right now we are in this time the Bible says let him who is filthy continue there's nothing that you can do with him right at the end let him continue and let the one that is Holy continue with his holy you won't change you will not change him also yeah you you see amen now let's go back to the Scriptures it says now uh Joshua chapter 5 and verse 12 ver says now therefore is it right no I'm reading a wrong chapter yeah it says and the Mana seized on the moru after they've eaten the old corn of the land you see now there's a manner of the seven church and there's the manner of the seals they are not the same amen so you are born in the church ages you grow and grow and grow I was in then I was telling some sisters that uh when uh the the Holy Ghost landed on Jesus Christ because he's typing that the lamb right amen and then when it LS it starts now to uh build a church now there's so many people that will say my church my church so now the Holy Ghost is the one that builded the church but remember the Holy Ghost is in the man right and then you grow you know the the the the the the the the the virtues is that you have faith you have a virtue you have a knowledge you have a temp you have patience you have godliness you have brotherly kindness now these things the Bible says if you lack one of them it's impossible for God to adopt you it says you see vividly you can't go further on so you cannot cross over because when you have them then God says this is my beloved sister and is my beloved Son it's not something that you can create God gives you are we together now from there on then you eat now EA let's read it again and the Mana seized on the morrow after they had eaten of the old cor that land amen neither had the children of Israel I mean sorry neither had the children of Israel Mana anymore right amen but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan okay let's go to numbers Numbers chapter 32 and then let's read verse 2 to 10 I hope you understand but now we are in a stage where now we understand uh that now actually somebody must take over and let us cross over so when brother Brenham departed he gave the Bon to the pastors now it it can really surprise you he said I'm going eastwards to open the seals now after I open the se he said the seventh seal is within me but the Holy Ghost will give you pastors right amen and they are the one that will give you your inheritance are we together now and here we are saying now the ministry is of the cap I mean it's of the yes it's of an Angel it's a Ministry of an angel now it start from here behind the pit the the angel of the church that is behind the will be the one that will give you your inheritance amen before we read on let's go to Hebrews I want I want us to we'll come back to this one let's go to the book of chapter 13 because when God speaks about himself but he will point a man to manifest what he was speaking about listen to verse 17 1 obey them that have the rule over you wait a bit obey them that a rule over you people don't want to be ruled amen that is why even at work they they struggle because at work there is directing manager is looking after the company and they are managers and they are supervisors now each and everyone is responsible and he's a leader so now if you can't listen to your supervisor you won't listen to the directing man because he's expressing what the the direct manager is [Applause] saying look look some of the traffic cops when you look at him he's just a young boy seems to be [Applause] useless from but but he could stand and stop big truck and give instructions the driver dare disrespect him he can take the keys he can remove everything and call another truck to come and pull this because he's authorized that is why when brother Harvest read said wait a bit I I want this to sink because it says read it again my brother verse 17 oby them that have the rule over you who's got the rule over you and then what does it says again and submit yourselves yes for they watch over your souls look the angel of the church is watching over your soul he's the one that will give you your inheritance now when you're going to say no now I'm going to be given by Christ and then where is your Christ let him come and give you now Christ has given it to the angel the prophet the angel the prophet gave it to the angel behind theit Angel behind the pit gave it to the angels so you have to know when the prophet says have You Met m means you have you met your angel when he says have you met your angel not referring to a man is referring to the man that will give you the word as it is a man that won't sacrifice with regardless of what people say the because he's an angel and you when you have received it you won't compromise about comprom because you're are an angel you stick to it you know your destination and you know how far are you are we together no brother Harvest it continues you you see it he watches for your soul there somebody that is watching your [Music] soul a human being is watching right amen because it continues as they that must give account right your pastor must give account about you whether you like it or not if it's off the word and you miss it you miss the Rapture you're going for a judgment and in the Judgment you will say no no my pastor didn't teach me about this then they would say give account pastor because the Bible says as they must give account so that when they give account that they may do it with joy and not with with grief you see when you are doing a wrong thing it Grieves your pastor because he's the one that is looking after your soul he's the one that must give account now when he speak to you he speak to you with a grieving spirit because you are not doing the right thing that gries hisory but if you are right he will say no uh this brother will be with me in New Jerusalem you will always hear him saying there are people that are going to be with me in Jerusalem now he's saying that with joy but he will start saying now being grieved now there are people who are going around in social media doing this and that is grieving him they're doing this and now he's giving account under a ging Spirit right amen for that is unprofitable for you you don't benefit a if the one that is looking after your soul is grieved but if the one that is looking upy you are also going to be so that's what it is let's then go to uh uh numbers 32 you see if you've got a son or a daughter or children when they are not doing the right thing you get grieved because you are a parent you say is this child of mine he going straight to hell you see amen but what can I do there is the pastor that preaches every Sunday why can't he do [Music] that so but if he's doing right I we are proud of your son we are proud of your daughter she's in the W she's fting the w right let's read uh numbers uh chapter 32 32 brother when did you start with did you check the time not really no so 12 okay okay 32 32 verse uh two verse two the children of God and the children of Ruben came and spake unto Moses and to elazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation saying atoro and Debon and Jer and nimra and heshbon and El and sheam and nebor and beon even the country which the Lord smoke before the congregation of Israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle wherefore said they if we have found Grace in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession and bring us not over Jordan you see what they say the the the the the inheritance is not the other side of Jan is that s but they say to Moses bring us not over Jordan please please Moses let us not be raptured Moses let us not go to the seals let us me around the ages around thees please Moses right amen if you come with the ministry of the third pool they say please let us not go into please let us not go to the power of taking over everything of taking over everything the power of the third PS no we don't want to be pulled we want to remain there there that's what they are saying to Moses and that's what they are saying to brother BR please let us be on the other side we don't want to cross over the ministry of the changing of the body the seven not this with the church continue my brother and Moses said unto the children of God and to the children of Reuben shall your brethren go to war and shall ye sit here and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord ha given them you know there are people that discourages people where do you Fellowship I Fellowship in M who's your pastor ah that one underworld ah that one is underworld no see what are are they doing they discourage people from crossing over the under world world is nothing else is the power that will take hold of the devil and expose him the seventh seene lot of you who are here had a spiritual problem you went to you all the instructions and everything it never worked until you come to the right place just listen to the word you know what Jesus Christ he says the word that I preach is alive it's a spirit and it's alive you know listening to the word only without anybody praying to you that spirit it's alive because when when you are sick you are under an attack right there's a spirit from darkness that will attack your cellss you name them but when you hear the word of God you develop and when that spirit of Darkness see that light it's bound to run away because the the right Ministry is light the light Ministry is the right Spirit if if you are in the right place if you are right in the you know Noah took his children and whoever they went inside there was noise outside but they were not worried they were settled there were s once you get inside it's warm it's warm you know it's warm in the seventh season you relax I know some elderly men like myself we've been together they running around they can't get settled when you are old it's time to sett down it's time to settle down and your children will come to you and say your children will come to you Dad can we give you a seat you even choose put it here yeah Dad can we make you a tea you don't run around you're an old man you relax you relax you enjoy the fruit of the land yeah last time I Meed to get the car then I I gave it to the pastor to to uh to dedicate it he said to me old man we are enjoying the fruits of the land you see if we can all be adjusted on the right Ministry relax and will enjoy the fruit of right now there will be those that will say we can't cross over look at what Moses said listen to what mes verse six and Moses said unto the children of God and to the children of Ruben shall you Brethren go to war and shall he sit here mhm and it means then then when you cross over what are you going to do going to fight but what does the promise say you go to the land of milk and honey that's what it says but when you get in there you see Giants that is why you need a cap your inheritance is to fight and the devil will not seat on a rocking chair if you are not at the right place if you are not at the right place he will toss you around let's let's go to Genesis 7 I I I will close in 15 minutes Genesis 7 let's read only verse 15 and 16 verse 15 and 16 Genesis chapter 7 yeah and they went in unto Noah into the ark two and two of All Flesh wherein is the breath of life and they that went in went in male and female of All Flesh as God had commanded him and the Lord shut him in the Lord shut him in once he got into the AR the Lord shut him in there's no way of going out right amen we are now in another dimension hallu once the cave and crew shut the door the ministry now is the inside Ministry the Lord sh you're eating now the fruit of the L one day he said but do you know who am I Peter said yes you are Christ the son of the Living God and then he said Peter Flesh and Blood did not reveal that and then he also gave him a name he said Thou Art Peter now which means a little Stone you know that we are little stones the prophet says there is a stone in your heart that comes from the rock can can you read Deuteronomy 32 we about to close H read verse four verse four there's no way that now the what you call the attrib tribute of God can be confused and can lose direction isn't that thing relax and enjoy the word of God am Deuteronomy ver4 yeah he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment a god of Truth and without iniquity just and right is he just and right is he am right God of Truth and without inity he is that Ro go to verse 18 verse 18 of the rock that begat thee thou you see the rock that begot Thee [Music] the he

mindful always be mindful of your ministry and be mindful that you are in a process and some people they don't want challenges in life no the chish proves who you are see proves who you are because you you need to have all the virtues are we together now our process or our migration is to bring us to the reality and who are we it's not an understanding it's a revelation he said Peter flesh and
