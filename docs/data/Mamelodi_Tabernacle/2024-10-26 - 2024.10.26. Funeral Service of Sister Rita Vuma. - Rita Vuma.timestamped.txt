[41:35] amen
[41:43] from okay brother is running
[41:47] around here and there I don't
[41:52] know
[41:54] but he's the one that is on the program
[41:57] to
[41:58] speak uh to give a
[42:01] speech so
[42:04] now as the Elder in the
[42:09] church maybe I could
[42:11] sense what he was supposed to say and
[42:14] tell you he didn't tell me but because
[42:17] I've been long with
[42:19] him I can be able to translate what he
[42:23] he was going to
[42:25] say okay uh
[42:29] firstly I'm going to
[42:33] say we know each other years
[42:36] back we've been fellowshipping
[42:40] L before even got married
[42:44] before you were married I mean you were
[42:49] born we were with your
[42:52] father he was closer to
[42:55] [Music]
[42:57] late our Elder they were very
[43:01] close then we met if my my memory serves
[43:07] me
[43:12] well so brother a those who knows the
[43:17] people I'm talking
[43:19] about so
[43:26] [Music]
[43:27] so we Fellowship together here in
[43:31] sang there was a time La is H in
[43:35] different
[43:36] houses until we got a place of
[43:42] worship if I'm not mistaken it's D or D
[43:46] so we used to be
[43:48] together until such time that he went
[43:52] back
[43:54] home
[43:55] then while
[44:08] now as and most of the elderly people
[44:12] that were
[44:18] [Music]
[44:19] together some of them have passed
[44:23] on I I could say um I'm the one now that
[44:26] is
[44:28] meing uh
[44:31] so we were together
[44:37] and we we just as as
[44:41] Believers we we automatically become
[44:47] families once you repent and then you
[44:51] know the
[44:52] Believers they automatically become your
[44:55] spiritual family you'll be having your
[44:58] your your your physical family but
[45:02] mostly we meet and fellowship and talk
[45:06] about the kingdom of God and talk about
[45:09] the mysteries of God and talk about the
[45:12] Revelation that's how it is now now the
[45:16] family they became part of
[45:21] us so now as an elderly person
[45:28] whenever they have problems they will
[45:31] come to
[45:32] [Music]
[45:38] me we have this and this and this when
[45:41] he's got a problem or he wants some
[45:45] guidance he will always come and say bab
[45:48] kosana can you guide me through here and
[45:51] here and there so this is a quiet and
[45:55] very humble family
[45:58] we are praying that now God should
[46:02] extend his hand and bring them all to
[46:06] their
[46:07] fold so yes that's how it is this family
[46:13] we just pray bab V and the family and
[46:16] the church at LGE that uh our prayers
[46:20] will never meet a t miss a Target and

[1:20:13] seats we had a wonderful
[1:20:16] time last
[1:20:20] night with our Elder
[1:20:25] comforting our
[1:20:27] hearts comforting the
[1:20:30] family comforting
[1:20:33] friends and
[1:20:35] comforting all the people that were
[1:20:37] close to our
[1:20:41] sister
[1:20:44] he was indeed inspired by the Holy
[1:20:50] Spirit to read the scriptures unto us
[1:20:56] so I'm just trying to follow on his
[1:21:02] footsteps I want to put a title
[1:21:06] to the message this
[1:21:10] morning I want to speak on the secret of
[1:21:14] life after
[1:21:19] death the secret of life after death
[1:21:26] this secret was not
[1:21:30] known until the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:35] came and he said I have the
[1:21:38] power to lay my life
[1:21:43] down and to rise it
[1:21:48] again there was never a
[1:21:51] man that was able to lay his life
[1:21:56] down and raise it
[1:22:00] again all this
[1:22:04] years
[1:22:06] death was an
[1:22:11] enemy but after the resurrection of the
[1:22:15] Lord Jesus
[1:22:18] Christ death was no longer an enemy
[1:22:25] there was also an argument among the
[1:22:28] Pharisees and the
[1:22:33] Sadducees the
[1:22:35] sad did not believe in the
[1:22:39] resurrection cuz they were not aware of
[1:22:42] the secret of life after
[1:22:49] death and the Pharisees believed in the
[1:22:52] resurrection
[1:22:55] but they didn't believe the message of
[1:22:57] the Lord Jesus
[1:23:02] Christ so they were
[1:23:05] blinded both the
[1:23:07] Pharisees and the
[1:23:10] Sadducees and the
[1:23:13] scribes they were all
[1:23:17] blinded and they were under the bondage
[1:23:20] of death
[1:23:24] until the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:27] came and he revealed the secret of
[1:23:32] life after
[1:23:35] death I want to read the
[1:23:38] scripture John chapter 8 while we are
[1:23:40] still
[1:23:43] here there was an
[1:23:46] argument between the Lord Jesus
[1:23:50] Christ and the Pharisees
[1:23:55] verse 51 says verse 51 verily verily I
[1:23:59] say unto
[1:24:01] you if a
[1:24:03] man keep my
[1:24:05] seeing he shall never see
[1:24:09] death that was the Lord Jesus
[1:24:12] Christ
[1:24:14] speaking says if a
[1:24:17] man he's talking about a moral
[1:24:22] B if a man
[1:24:25] keep my
[1:24:29] say you shall never see
[1:24:35] death that was the first
[1:24:37] time they heard a man saying those
[1:24:41] words if a man keep my
[1:24:45] say he shall never see
[1:24:48] death then said the Jews unto
[1:24:52] him now we know
[1:24:57] that thou has a
[1:25:01] Dev they were
[1:25:04] blinded they didn't
[1:25:07] know and they
[1:25:09] say even quoting the
[1:25:13] scriptures to the Lord Jesus
[1:25:16] Christ Abraham is
[1:25:20] dead and the prophets
[1:25:24] and thou
[1:25:26] sayest if a man keep my
[1:25:30] saying he shall never taste of
[1:25:33] death cuz they were under the bondage of
[1:25:37] death our Elder yesterday
[1:25:42] said people feared
[1:25:45] death and they were under the
[1:25:49] bondage of
[1:25:51] death
[1:25:52] now here comes the Lord Jesus
[1:25:55] Christ say if you keep my
[1:25:59] sa you shall never see
[1:26:03] death now they looked at
[1:26:06] him and they
[1:26:08] said art thou greater than our Father
[1:26:15] Abraham and they
[1:26:17] repeat Abraham Abraham which is
[1:26:21] dead to them Abraham was dead
[1:26:26] to them the prophets were
[1:26:29] did then yet a man
[1:26:32] says if you keep my
[1:26:34] saying you shall never see
[1:26:38] death hallelujah amen
[1:26:42] amen I hope you don't fear
[1:26:46] death hallelujah amen amen
[1:26:52] amen it says here
[1:26:57] art thou greater than our Father
[1:27:01] Abraham which is dead and the prophets
[1:27:04] are
[1:27:06] dead who maketh thou
[1:27:13] thy asking the Lord Jesus
[1:27:17] Christ
[1:27:19] who makest thou
[1:27:22] thyself and say if you keep my
[1:27:25] saying you shall never see
[1:27:29] that hallelujah amen then he answers
[1:27:33] them and I'm going to read Luke chap 20:
[1:27:45] 38 he
[1:27:47] says telling them now about
[1:27:51] Abraham about Isaac
[1:27:54] and about
[1:27:58] Jacob says now that I'll start from
[1:28:01] verse 37 from verse
[1:28:06] 37 uh maybe I should start from verse 35
[1:28:10] amen but they we shall be accounted
[1:28:15] worthy to obtain that
[1:28:21] world you see the the Bible promise
[1:28:25] us about the future
[1:28:29] where when you read Revelation chapter
[1:28:33] 21 there is a
[1:28:35] promise that in the world to
[1:28:38] come there will be no more
[1:28:41] death hallelujah amen and he
[1:28:45] says and the resurrection from the
[1:28:49] dead for there are
[1:28:52] those that are
[1:28:55] counted
[1:28:57] worthy to obtain that
[1:29:00] world so that means the world that is to
[1:29:03] come is not for
[1:29:05] everyone but only those that are counted
[1:29:10] worthy we will look at it later who are
[1:29:14] these worthy
[1:29:16] ones that are
[1:29:20] accounted for the future world to come
[1:29:24] it is not
[1:29:25] everyone but there are those that are
[1:29:29] worthy for the
[1:29:32] future amen amen and the resurrection
[1:29:35] from the
[1:29:36] dead so there are those that are
[1:29:39] accounted
[1:29:41] worthy for the resurrection of the
[1:29:44] de it's not
[1:29:47] everyone you know uh when somebody pass
[1:29:51] away or when somebody depart
[1:29:55] there is a
[1:29:56] saying may his soul rest in
[1:30:05] peace
[1:30:09] rest it's easy to speak lies this
[1:30:20] thingsapp we will be posting that even
[1:30:23] on WhatsApp soul rest in
[1:30:26] peace we must be honest he didn't
[1:30:29] believe the word of God how can you rest
[1:30:32] in peace it's not worthy to be counted
[1:30:37] in the first
[1:30:39] resurrection unlike our sister
[1:30:41] here he is accounted
[1:30:45] worthy of the world to come he's
[1:30:49] accounted
[1:30:50] worthy of the first resurrection
[1:30:54] hallelujah amen so the Bible
[1:30:58] says there are those that are accounted
[1:31:02] with to obtain the world to come and the
[1:31:06] resurrection from the
[1:31:08] dead verse 36 verse
[1:31:11] 36 neither can they die
[1:31:15] anymore you know death is a
[1:31:20] separation from the loved ones
[1:31:24] you know the Lord Jesus Christ said to
[1:31:27] his
[1:31:29] disciples
[1:31:31] Lazarus is
[1:31:34] sleeping even the disciples were
[1:31:37] happy I love their
[1:31:41] respond they said
[1:31:44] Lord if
[1:31:46] Lazarus
[1:31:48] sleep he's doing
[1:31:50] well he will
[1:31:52] wake no
[1:31:55] problem so the Lord Jesus Christ noticed
[1:32:00] that they don't understand this
[1:32:03] language then he spoke plainly unto
[1:32:07] them Lazarus
[1:32:11] is so our our sister
[1:32:15] sleepeth you will do
[1:32:18] well he will
[1:32:20] awake hallelujah amen
[1:32:26] let me continue even
[1:32:28] Moses sh at the
[1:32:33] Bush when he call the Lord the god of
[1:32:37] Abraham the god of
[1:32:39] Isaac and the god of
[1:32:42] Jacob for he is not a god of the
[1:32:47] dead but of the
[1:32:49] living for all live unto him
[1:32:55] you see to the
[1:32:57] Pharisees they said Abraham is
[1:33:01] dead and the prophets are
[1:33:03] dead they did not understand the secret
[1:33:06] of life after
[1:33:08] death but to the Lord Jesus
[1:33:11] Christ the Bible says he is not God of
[1:33:15] the
[1:33:16] day because
[1:33:19] Abraham Isaac Jacob they are not de to
[1:33:23] you
[1:33:24] they
[1:33:25] live hallelujah amen they are not dead
[1:33:29] you see the are three
[1:33:34] stages we read the book of
[1:33:37] Corinthians it talks about the body
[1:33:41] terrestrial that is a mortal
[1:33:44] body then it talks about imortal
[1:33:52] body now that is a cal body that is the
[1:33:56] body that our Elder yesterday
[1:33:58] said when you depart from this Mortal
[1:34:04] body there's another body

[1:37:48] talk about how to prepare this Mortal
[1:37:52] body
[1:37:55] so that the
[1:37:57] incorruptable can swallow the

[1:39:01] Grave so we are taking the body of our
[1:39:06] sister to the
[1:39:08] Grave hallelujah amen now it says in the
[1:39:12] Resurrection the

[1:41:19] Christ will release your spirit
[1:41:24] and it will go into the sixth
[1:41:27] Dimension to pick up your

[1:41:53] you don't
[1:41:54] eat you are just
[1:41:57] waiting in a place of
[1:42:00] rest and there is no old age
[1:42:03] there so it says old age is is is a sign
[1:42:10] of of
[1:42:15] sin so old
[1:42:18] age is a
[1:42:20] sign that we were once out of the Garden
[1:42:24] of
[1:42:26] Eden because of
[1:42:28] sin but the prophet
[1:42:32] says when you
[1:42:35] enter the sixth
[1:42:38] Dimension you
[1:42:40] become at your
[1:42:43] youth you go back to your youth
[1:42:49] age you are not old there
[1:42:53] you know we read the scripture in the
[1:42:55] book of
[1:42:56] Corinthians it
[1:42:58] says and God gives them a
[1:43:03] body as it has pleased
[1:43:07] him you see if you please God while you
[1:43:11] are still alive when you

[1:43:16] body because you have pleased
[1:43:19] him and you become young again a
[1:43:23] Celestial

[1:43:30] spirit it will go into the sixth
[1:43:33] Dimension pick up your
[1:43:36] soul and it comes to the Earth to pick

[1:45:46] rest with an immortal body
[1:45:53] amen
[1:45:55] amen it's only
[1:45:59] those that were
[1:46:04] converted that
[1:46:06] received an
[1:46:10] abstract abstract which is their title
[1:46:13] de while they are still
[1:46:17] alive hallelujah amen so I want to talk
[1:46:20] about this Mortals
[1:46:27] Mortals I want to talk about those that
[1:46:29] are
[1:46:33] alive which the Bible
[1:46:37] says they are counted
[1:46:40] worthy for the first
[1:46:44] resurrection how can one be counted
[1:46:50] Worth to come in the first result
[1:46:55] while you are still
[1:46:57] alive you cannot be counted worthy after
[1:47:02] death but you must be counted
[1:47:06] with while you are still
[1:47:09] here while you are still
[1:47:13] alive hallelujah
[1:47:20] amen you know uh uh let's go back to
[1:47:25] Romans
[1:47:30] 8:1 but if the spirit of

[1:47:44] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:47:49] dead shall also Quicken your moral
[1:47:55] bodies by his
[1:47:58] spirit that dwelleth in
[1:48:01] you hallelujah amen now we must find
[1:48:08] out the
[1:48:10] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:48:14] the dead because that
[1:48:17] Spirit must dwell in
[1:48:20] you hallelujah amen
[1:48:27] and it says that
[1:48:30] spirit will
[1:48:32] Quicken your mortal
[1:48:36] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:48:41] you you
[1:48:44] see you receive the
[1:48:47] weight that is very good you believe the

[1:48:57] quickened and it is the
[1:48:59] spirit that raised Jesus from the
[1:49:03] dead that can Quicken your
[1:49:09] mortal so if you are not
[1:49:13] quickened then you are not a potential
[1:49:16] for the first
[1:49:20] resurrection amen amen
[1:49:23] it
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:25] says now the

[1:50:03] Quicken means to be made
[1:50:07] alive and it is only the
[1:50:11] spirit that can Quicken this
[1:50:14] body amen
[1:50:17] amen as we continue it says
[1:50:23] that when you receive that
[1:50:26] spirit is a
[1:50:28] confirmation of the
[1:50:32] Resurrection the spirit that raised
[1:50:35] Jesus from the

[1:53:15] glory which shall be revealed in us so
[1:53:18] there's a
[1:53:19] glory that must be revealed in
[1:53:25] That Glory must be revealed while you

[1:53:33] glory that is growing in
[1:53:36] you and that Glory must be
[1:53:40] revealed amen amen go on my brother for
[1:53:44] the earnest expectation of the creature

[1:53:56] earth he said Greater Works shall you
[1:54:00] do says the works that I do shall you do
[1:54:05] also and greater than this shall you
[1:54:09] do you know there was a time that he was
[1:54:11] sleeping in the
[1:54:15] boat and Satan was trying to take
[1:54:19] advantage with a storm
[1:54:23] threatening the
[1:54:25] disciples and they woke the Lord Jesus
[1:54:29] Master we are dying here wake
[1:54:34] up and the Lord stop and the Lord Jesus
[1:54:37] Christ stopped to the
[1:54:40] storm and he said where's your
[1:54:44] faith meaning I'm not the one that must
[1:54:49] stop the storm
[1:54:52] when I made you in the
[1:54:54] beginning I made you to have dominion
[1:54:58] over the

[1:55:33] where our Elder yesterday
[1:55:35] said this must come by
[1:55:39] Revelation and he quoted Matthew chapter
[1:55:44] 16 and it says this must also be
[1:55:49] revealed unto you hallelujah amen now
[1:55:54] let us read my brother it
[1:55:57] says for the earnest expectation of the
[1:56:00] Creator
[1:56:04] wait for the manifestations of the sons
[1:56:07] of
[1:56:08] God so there will come a time that the
[1:56:12] sons of
[1:56:14] God are
[1:56:16] manifested the
[1:56:18] glory is
[1:56:19] revealed in them when our Elder was
[1:56:24] praying he said there is an Uninvited
[1:56:30] Guest I'm sure you heard him there's an
[1:56:34] Uninvited
[1:56:36] Guest but his prayer was telling that
[1:56:40] Uninvited Guest that you have no power
[1:56:46] yet the sons of God are
[1:56:50] manifested they have that power
[1:56:53] to stop
[1:56:55] you hallelujah amen amen
[1:57:00] amen verse 20 my
[1:57:02] brother for the creature was made
[1:57:05] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[1:57:09] reason of him who has subjected the same
[1:57:12] in
[1:57:14] Hope because the creature itself also
[1:57:17] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:57:20] corruption into the glory Liberty of the
[1:57:23] children of
[1:57:24] God continue for we know that the whole
[1:57:28] creation grown and travaileth in pain
[1:57:31] together until now and not only they but
[1:57:35] ourselves also which have the first
[1:57:37] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[1:57:40] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[1:57:43] adoption to wait the Redemption of our
[1:57:47] body you see when you talk about the
[1:57:49] secret of life
[1:57:52] after
[1:57:55] death he talks about a
[1:57:58] journey from
[1:58:01] Mortal to Immortal to a glorified
[1:58:06] body but it says even though we are
[1:58:11] groaning with the first
[1:58:13] fruit of our
[1:58:17] spirit we are
[1:58:20] waiting for the
[1:58:23] adoption hallelujah
[1:58:26] amen and when you receive the
[1:58:30] adoption it means you receive the
[1:58:32] Redemption of
[1:58:35] your so when the sons of God are
[1:58:39] adopted while they are still
[1:58:42] here their bodies are
[1:58:45] redeemed they are
[1:58:49] just waiting
[1:58:52] to show
[1:58:54] it hallelujah
[1:58:57] amen you know it
[1:59:00] says
[1:59:04] potentially the quickening
[1:59:07] power of your
[1:59:11] Resurrection is already in you when you
[1:59:15] receive the Holy
[1:59:18] Spirit when that spirit is dwelling in
[1:59:20] you
[1:59:22] it means you are
[1:59:25] growing to the full
[1:59:29] Resurrection one day the
[1:59:33] incorruptable shall swallow the
[1:59:37] corruptable and
[1:59:39] the and Paul says we shall be
[1:59:43] changed in the twinkling of
[1:59:49] an that's if that spirit dwells in
[1:59:53] you when you die it will raise you from
[1:59:58] the
[2:00:01] dead
[2:00:04] elishah received a double
[2:00:07] potion of the
[2:00:10] spirit that was in
[2:00:13] Elijah when Elijah
[2:00:16] died at an old
[2:00:20] age they buried him
[2:00:23] and the the
[2:00:26] body
[2:00:29] deteriorated into
[2:00:33] bones for hundreds and hundreds of
[2:00:37] years then one day a dead body was
[2:00:42] dropped but the
[2:00:46] power the quickening
[2:00:48] power was still in Elijah
[2:00:53] even though Elijah was in
[2:00:56] Paradise but the body itself the bones
[2:01:01] that were in the grave they still had
[2:01:04] that quickening power a man that dropped
[2:01:07] dead down
[2:01:09] there
[2:01:11] resurrected because of the power that
[2:01:14] was in
[2:01:16] Elijah hallelujah amen even when elishah
[2:01:20] was dead that quicking
[2:01:23] power was still
[2:01:27] there hallelujah amen amen so that's why
[2:01:31] it
[2:01:32] says if the spirit that raised Jesus
[2:01:35] from the
[2:01:36] dead dwelleth in you it will also raise
[2:01:40] you from the
[2:01:42] dead you
[2:01:45] see H the Lord Jesus Christ didn't need
[2:01:50] another person
[2:01:52] to come and raise him
[2:01:55] up you don't need another person to come
[2:01:58] in the first
[2:02:00] resurrection that power must be in you
[2:02:04] when you hear the
[2:02:06] voice of
[2:02:08] Resurrection you stand up because the
[2:02:11] power is in
[2:02:12] you you don't need
[2:02:14] somebody to give you
[2:02:17] power you see when Lazarus was dead
[2:02:22] what Lazarus
[2:02:24] heard was to
[2:02:26] recognize the voice of the Lord Jesus
[2:02:32] Christ when the Lord went to the
[2:02:36] graveyard when he went to the
[2:02:39] Tom he said
[2:02:41] Lazarus come forth with a loud
[2:02:45] voice and the Lazarus that came
[2:02:50] forth was the one that
[2:02:53] recognized the voice of the Lord Jesus
[2:02:56] Christ that's why he says my sheep hear
[2:03:01] my
[2:03:02] voice when they are
[2:03:04] alive they hear his
[2:03:07] voice when they are dead they recognize
[2:03:11] his
[2:03:13] voice hallelujah amen you
[2:03:16] know when when when is preaching
[2:03:22] I can hear my
[2:03:24] pastor speaking in
[2:03:29] him and that means I recognize the voice
[2:03:34] of the Lord Jesus

[2:05:23] resurrection you come in a glorified
[2:05:29] Bo God will release your
[2:05:33] spirit and it will go into the sixth
[2:05:37] Dimension into that place of
[2:05:40] rest it will pick up your
[2:05:44] soul and it will come down to the
[2:05:47] Earth and pick up the
[2:05:50] substance that you lived

[2:05:55] body and you will now be in a glorified
[2:06:00] [Music]
[2:06:01] body now when you are in a glorified
[2:06:07] body the beauty
[2:06:10] part is you can
[2:06:12] eat but when we in a Celestial
[2:06:15] body you don't
[2:06:18] eat when we are in this body
[2:06:21] you get
[2:06:22] sick you need a car to
[2:06:26] travel to go to
[2:06:28] limo you need a bus to go and see your
[2:06:32] beloved
[2:06:33] ones you travel through days and
[2:06:38] days to go to
[2:06:40] mamb you have to cross a
[2:06:44] border in this
[2:06:46] body but in a glorified
[2:06:49] body you don't need those
[2:06:53] things hallelujah
[2:06:55] amen you don't need those
[2:06:58] things even the
[2:07:01] walls cannot stop
[2:07:03] you you know when they were in the upper
[2:07:08] room with the doors
[2:07:10] locked making sure that nobody will come
[2:07:15] in and they just heard the Lord saying
[2:07:18] peace
[2:07:22] he didn't have to
[2:07:25] knock he didn't to say hey open the
[2:07:28] door he just walked in and said Peace be
[2:07:33] unto
[2:07:34] you you know the glorified the
[2:07:37] body that's what we long
[2:07:40] for amen amen now I want us to go to the
[2:07:44] Book of Matthew chapter 16
[2:07:51] and
[2:07:52] I I want to close with that
[2:07:57] scripture may the Lord richly bless
[2:08:00] you my brother let us read from verse
[2:08:05] 13 Matthew 16 from verse
[2:08:08] 13 when Jesus came into the coast of
[2:08:11] cesaria Philip he asked his disciples
[2:08:15] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[2:08:18] man am let's stop right there
[2:08:23] whom do
[2:08:24] men say that I the son of
[2:08:29] men you see the
[2:08:34] gospel is not about what the people say
[2:08:37] about
[2:08:41] him but it's about what you say he
[2:08:46] is he must be revealed to you
[2:08:51] you know the Bible says
[2:08:54] John recognized him when he came to the
[2:08:58] River
[2:08:59] Jordan to be
[2:09:01] baptized but for John to recognize
[2:09:04] him he was revealed by the Holy
[2:09:08] Spirit and John says I saw the Spirit
[2:09:14] like a dove coming to him and John
[2:09:18] recognized him and said this is the one
[2:09:23] so now the
[2:09:25] Lord brings that question to the
[2:09:29] disciples who do men say I the son of
[2:09:34] man
[2:09:35] am verse
[2:09:37] 14 and they said some say that thou art
[2:09:41] John the Baptist some Elias and others
[2:09:44] Jeremiah or one of the prophets he sath
[2:09:48] unto them but whom say ye that I
[2:09:51] you see he want to be
[2:09:53] recognized he want to be
[2:09:56] revealed unto
[2:09:58] you because you cannot say the spirit
[2:10:02] that raised Jesus Christ from the
[2:10:04] dead dwelleth in me where as you have
[2:10:08] not even received the revelation of who
[2:10:11] he
[2:10:14] is you need to know who he
[2:10:18] is hallelujah amen if you don't know who
[2:10:21] who he is then you can't come up in the
[2:10:25] resurrection how will you recognize him
[2:10:28] how will you hear his
[2:10:30] voice Hallelujah so he wanted the
[2:10:35] disciples to say who he
[2:10:40] is read again my brother verse 15 he
[2:10:44] said unto them but whom say ye that I
[2:10:47] am continue
[2:10:51] and Simon Peter answered and said Thou
[2:10:54] Art Christ the son of the Living
[2:10:58] God only Simon
[2:11:02] Peter
[2:11:04] responded I'm sure they were looking at
[2:11:06] one
[2:11:08] another say hey what are we going to
[2:11:12] say because we have told him what the
[2:11:14] people
[2:11:15] say but now this is directed
[2:11:18] to individuals
[2:11:23] then
[2:11:24] Peter received the greatest
[2:11:27] Revelation that he is the Christ the son
[2:11:32] of the Living God you know Christ means
[2:11:35] the
[2:11:37] anointing verse 17 my brother verse 17
[2:11:41] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[2:11:44] blessed are thou Simon bonah for Flesh
[2:11:47] and Blood ha not revealed it unto thee
[2:11:50] but my father which is in heaven so this
[2:11:53] revelation of who he is is revealed by
[2:11:58] the father
[2:12:01] himself hallelujah amen it is revealed
[2:12:06] by the father
[2:12:08] himself you know there was a time that
[2:12:10] the disciples
[2:12:13] asked and they said show us thy
[2:12:16] father you have been talking about your
[2:12:19] father show us thy father
[2:12:22] and he said the father is in
[2:12:25] me hallelujah amen and the pastor says
[2:12:29] when you see the
[2:12:31] word being revealed you have seen the
[2:12:37] father hallelujah amen I normally
[2:12:42] H H say a a
[2:12:45] joke you know Samuel heard the voice of
[2:12:49] God
[2:12:52] and and and El said you must respond
[2:12:55] they say speak my
[2:12:58] lord your servant is
[2:13:01] listening so H we always had that kind
[2:13:06] of an
[2:13:08] expectation that we want to hear the
[2:13:10] voice of God speaking to
[2:13:13] us until when your parents call you from
[2:13:17] the
[2:13:19] kitchen say when they call you you just
[2:13:22] say speak my lord your servant is
[2:13:29] listening because it's not the voice
[2:13:31] coming from
[2:13:34] outside it comes from the inside and you
[2:13:37] will
[2:13:39] recognize amen
[2:13:42] amen now
[2:13:44] Peter received that
[2:13:47] Revelation and the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:13:50] said blessed are
[2:13:53] thou he see for receiving that
[2:13:56] Revelation you are
[2:13:58] blessed amen amen Verse
[2:14:02] 18 and I say also unto thee that thou
[2:14:06] art Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[2:14:09] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[2:14:11] shall not Prevail against
[2:14:14] it when you receive that
[2:14:18] Revelation it says the gates of hell
[2:14:23] will not Prevail against
[2:14:27] you you
[2:14:29] see that is the prevention we
[2:14:32] need
[2:14:36] protection the
[2:14:38] revelation of who he
[2:14:40] is when you receive that
[2:14:43] Revelation it says the gates of
[2:14:46] H will not Prevail against
[2:14:52] just to receive the
[2:14:53] revelation of who he
[2:14:57] is hallelujah
[2:15:00] amen the last verse
[2:15:04] 20 then charged he his disciples that
[2:15:08] they should tell no man that he was
[2:15:10] Jesus the Christ you see that
[2:15:14] Revelation it's not something that
[2:15:16] somebody can tell
[2:15:18] you that he is Jesus the Christ
[2:15:22] it is something that comes by
[2:15:25] Revelation amen amen now let me go to
[2:15:31] this you know H the Bible says You must
[2:15:34] be born
[2:15:38] again it says You must be born
[2:15:40] again and I want to read this to
[2:15:45] you you see a new
[2:15:48] body comes from this born
[2:15:53] again you see the body that must swallow
[2:15:57] this corruptable
[2:15:59] body it comes from this Born
[2:16:04] Again from this new
[2:16:08] birth hallelujah amen the new birth is
[2:16:12] the
[2:16:13] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[2:16:18] you as it happened to Peter
[2:16:22] so it says when you receive that
[2:16:24] Revelation you also receive a new
[2:16:29] body so a new body comes from this new
[2:16:35] birth without that new birth you don't
[2:16:39] have a new
[2:16:41] body because the Bible says the in
[2:16:45] corruptable will swallow the
[2:16:49] corruptable so is the new body that you
[2:16:53] receive from this new birth that will
[2:16:57] swallow the
[2:17:01] corruptable when you receive the new
[2:17:03] birth which is the revelation of Jesus
[2:17:07] Christ the new birth is
[2:17:11] Christ hallelujah amen the inside of
[2:17:16] you down in
[2:17:18] here inside
[2:17:21] that is a person that cannot
[2:17:24] die and that's the person that the New
[2:17:28] Life Starts
[2:17:33] from when the Bible says You must be
[2:17:35] born
[2:17:37] again it says You must be born of
[2:17:41] water and the
[2:17:43] spirit that's why the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:17:46] said you must be baptized in the name of
[2:17:51] the Lord Jesus
[2:17:54] Christ if you are baptized any other
[2:17:58] way you are far from the
[2:18:01] kingdom baptism must be in the name of
[2:18:05] the Lord Jesus
[2:18:07] Christ amen amen now when you receive
[2:18:11] the baptism in the name of the Lord
[2:18:13] Jesus
[2:18:14] Christ you know it
[2:18:17] says God will give you a new heart
[2:18:22] and a new
[2:18:24] spirit that means you'll have a new
[2:18:26] desire for the
[2:18:29] way you receive a new
[2:18:33] board when you receive the
[2:18:36] revelation of who Jesus Christ
[2:18:39] is then a body start to
[2:18:42] develop inside of
[2:18:44] you and he says that that is a new
[2:18:48] body a new life
[2:18:51] that starts from this new
[2:18:54] birth and it builds another
[2:18:59] person in the image of this person that
[2:19:03] you
[2:19:05] are so when you receive this new
[2:19:08] birth we see
[2:19:11] you but inside of you there's a new
[2:19:15] body that is
[2:19:17] growing and one day that body will
[2:19:22] swallow the
[2:19:24] corruptable let me read the last thing
[2:19:28] here H you see I'm
[2:19:31] closing I just want to read this to
[2:19:34] you about this
[2:19:36] mysterious new body that
[2:19:39] [Music]
[2:19:41] develops cuz that is the glory that will
[2:19:44] be revealed in
[2:19:47] you now it says Romans
[2:19:52] 8:1 the spirit that raised Jesus from
[2:19:57] the dead if that spirit dwelleth in you
[2:20:01] it will raise you from the
[2:20:03] dead so now the people that have this
[2:20:07] Spirit the Bible
[2:20:09] says they
[2:20:12] associate with the Unseen
[2:20:16] World and the supernatural
[2:20:20] you know was preaching in
[2:20:24] m and he
[2:20:27] quoted where the pastor says I have seen
[2:20:33] that New
[2:20:36] Jerusalem and
[2:20:39] says God will never allow you to preach
[2:20:45] about something that you didn't
[2:20:49] see hallelujah amen so when he talks
[2:20:54] about the New Jerusalem you have seen it
[2:20:58] when he preach about
[2:21:02] Millennial when he talks about the sixth
[2:21:07] Dimension hallelujah amen so when you
[2:21:10] receive the spirit that dwell that
[2:21:12] raised Jesus from the
[2:21:14] dead while you are here you start to
[2:21:19] associate with the
[2:21:22] Unseen you start to
[2:21:24] associate with the
[2:21:26] [Music]
[2:21:27] supernatural hallelujah amen no wonder
[2:21:31] people can't believe these
[2:21:34] things because you associate with
[2:21:37] Angelic
[2:21:38] beings with the
[2:21:41] supernatural it
[2:21:43] says when the Holy Spirit comes into the
[2:21:48] heart quickly you become a twofold
[2:21:54] being you become a two-fold
[2:21:58] being you are still subject to Earth in
[2:22:00] this
[2:22:03] body you are subject to
[2:22:06] death but in your
[2:22:08] soul you have passed from Death unto
[2:22:13] life hallelujah amen
[2:22:18] and the body is subject to
[2:22:23] death but at the same
[2:22:26] time one of
[2:22:29] you you are heaven and you live
[2:22:35] there while you are still
[2:22:38] here no
[2:22:40] wonder you
[2:22:42] cannot de associate
[2:22:46] us with the gospel of the Lord Jesus
[2:22:49] Christ
[2:22:51] amen amen in this body you are still
[2:22:54] subject to
[2:22:56] death remember death is just a
[2:23:00] separation from the loved
[2:23:03] ones the Bible speaks of the first
[2:23:07] death and the second death so the second
[2:23:11] death is when you die in your
[2:23:14] soul that means you are totally
[2:23:17] separated from God
[2:23:21] but when you
[2:23:24] depart from here you are just separated
[2:23:27] from your
[2:23:30] love hallelujah amen but then you must
[2:23:34] avoid the second
[2:23:37] death while you are still
[2:23:41] here the first death you still have a
[2:23:45] chance of
[2:23:47] Resurrection but you can avoid the
[2:23:50] second day
[2:23:52] amen
[2:23:54] amen and it says the people that have
[2:23:57] this
[2:23:59] Spirit the angels of
[2:24:02] God visit
[2:24:05] them hallelujah amen to
[2:24:09] reveal and to bring a message from
[2:24:12] God to the
[2:24:16] individual you see the spirit that
[2:24:19] raised Jesus from the
[2:24:22] is your birth
[2:24:24] right and that is the spirit that will
[2:24:26] bring you forth in the
[2:24:29] Resurrection May the Lord richly bless
[2:24:32] you
[2:24:34] amen as we stand on our
[2:24:37] feet I will invite our
[2:24:41] Deon to come
