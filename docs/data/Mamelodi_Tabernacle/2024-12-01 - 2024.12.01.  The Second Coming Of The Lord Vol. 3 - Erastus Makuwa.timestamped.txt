[1:18:31] is even
[1:18:34] now they don't

[1:18:43] know because he is he is
[1:18:51] dispensational in this dispensation is
[1:18:53] this one
[1:18:55] in this is this
[1:18:58] one this is this

[1:19:04] who we are expecting to

[1:19:14] read the scripture my
[1:19:17] brother Mark 10: 13
[1:19:22] to6 and they brought young children to
[1:19:24] him that he should touch them and his
[1:19:27] disciples rebuke those that brought them
[1:19:29] but when Jesus saw it he was much
[1:19:31] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[1:19:34] little children to come unto me and
[1:19:36] forbid them not for of such is the
[1:19:39] kingdom of God verily I say unto you
[1:19:42] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[1:19:45] of God as a little child he shall not
[1:19:47] enter therein and he took them up in his
[1:19:50] arms put his hands upon them and blessed
[1:19:53] them I believe if the mother is has
[1:19:56] brought their child to
[1:20:01] Christ not to
[1:20:04] past but to
[1:20:06] Christ and if she believe that she is

[1:44:36] message
[1:44:38] we must be used by

[1:46:02] things you must
[1:46:05] know he says in verse two for
[1:46:09] yourself know perfectly that the day of
[1:46:13] the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[1:46:21] night and verse three said for for when
[1:46:25] they shall say
[1:46:29] peace and
[1:46:31] safety then suddenly destruction cometh
[1:46:34] upon them as a as travail upon a woman
[1:46:38] with a child and they shall not
[1:46:49] Escape he says
[1:46:51] they amen
[1:46:53] not
[1:46:54] us because we
[1:46:58] know but they don't
[1:47:01] know he says verse four but de
[1:47:05] Brethren are not in

[1:48:29] see there are people there are there
[1:48:33] will be
[1:48:34] few who will be
[1:48:38] raptured very
[1:48:43] few and there will be
[1:48:47] some who will
[1:48:51] remain but but
[1:48:54] some are
[1:48:59] blinded by false
[1:49:03] [Music]
[1:49:07] teachers as as we have got true
[1:49:13] teachers we have got false
[1:49:16] teachers as we have got true
[1:49:20] pastors we have got false
[1:49:25] you see somebody he is has been
[1:49:30] blinded just like
[1:49:32] Israel Israel was
[1:49:35] blinded by God
[1:49:37] himself do you know
[1:49:39] that they are even
[1:49:42] now they're still waiting for
[1:49:46] theiah they still waiting for Malachi
[1:49:49] 3:1
[1:49:53] to be
[1:49:55] fulfilled in his thir
[1:49:58] coming they will think it is his first
[1:50:03] coming because they were
[1:50:06] blinded when they were saying crucify
[1:50:12] him they were
[1:50:14] blinded there are people in our
[1:50:17] days who are
[1:50:20] blinded what kind of teaching do you
[1:50:25] get because the teaching you are
[1:50:28] getting it can
[1:50:32] blind you see they were the
[1:50:36] Pharisees they were teaching them about
[1:50:39] the coming
[1:50:42] Messiah quoting
[1:50:45] scriptures that he is coming coming to
[1:50:49] his
[1:50:51] Temple but
[1:50:55] conceived because they were
[1:50:58] blinded they couldn't see that this is
[1:51:01] what the
[1:51:04] scriptures only a
[1:51:07] few who were PR
[1:51:09] Destin could
[1:51:11] see even now people will C Malachi
[1:51:15] chapter
[1:51:17] 4 we qu our
[1:51:20] Prophet but by being
[1:51:23] that they will blind
[1:51:29] [Music]
[1:51:32] others are you
[1:51:36] listening
[1:51:37] because if you don't know who you
[1:51:43] are the message you have to
[1:51:49] receive then you are
[1:51:53] in a
[1:51:55] terrible
[1:52:01] condition this message is not leave this
[1:52:04] that or the other this message is not
[1:52:08] leave this that
[1:52:14] or because you have already left
[1:52:18] them long ago
[1:52:23] now you are
[1:52:25] where you
[1:52:27] must
[1:52:31] know their
[1:52:37] signs what will
[1:52:41] happen he
[1:52:45] says ye are all the children of light
[1:52:50] verse five
[1:52:55] and the children of the
[1:52:57] day we are not of the
[1:53:01] night nor of
[1:53:03] darkness in other words we know what the
[1:53:05] Rapture
[1:53:08] is we know how it will
[1:53:13] happen some they just say they are
[1:53:16] waiting
[1:53:18] for in denominational denominations
[1:53:23] they said they're waiting for
[1:53:25] artion you know what the denomination
[1:53:30] is some believes that the denomination
[1:53:33] is Catholic church or Presbyterian
[1:53:42] or a denomination denomination is a
[1:53:46] group of
[1:53:47] people who are without the revelation
[1:53:55] that
[1:53:56] group whether they can say they believe
[1:53:59] the prophet
[1:54:01] or as long as they like the
[1:54:06] Revelation they operate outside the
[1:54:13] Revelation then they are a
[1:54:15] denomination denomination because the
[1:54:17] denomination is where you come together
[1:54:23] you try to collect to put yourself
[1:54:27] together and you use your own
[1:54:30] ideas a certain man was trying to tell
[1:54:33] me about
[1:54:35] something I said where do you get
[1:54:38] it he said according to me said no when
[1:54:42] is according to
[1:54:45] you but if you can say the Bible says or
[1:54:49] the prophet says then I will
[1:54:54] then I will try to read where you say
[1:54:58] you so that I can see whether I where
[1:55:01] I've come
[1:55:03] wrong but when you say according to
[1:55:06] me that is
[1:55:11] aomination
[1:55:15] amen this is not according to
[1:55:18] me is according to what the prophet said
[1:55:23] what the Bible
[1:55:26] says we are not the children of
[1:55:30] Darkness we are the children of
[1:55:33] light we are
[1:55:37] light that's why we shine where we
[1:55:44] are you we are light because we have
[1:55:47] received
[1:55:49] light you cannot try to be light if you
[1:55:52] have not received
[1:55:57] light even if you
[1:55:59] try you will never be
[1:56:02] light because you must receive that
[1:56:06] light then you will be
[1:56:10] light then you become the Child of
[1:56:17] Light let me read here he says here we
[1:56:22] have read it he said the Lord
[1:56:27] himself when he's
[1:56:30] descending he's descending with three
[1:56:35] things
[1:56:37] shout
[1:56:39] voice
[1:56:41] trumpet then what let me let's start
[1:56:44] with this
[1:56:46] shout this
[1:56:48] shout is a message calling the bride to
[1:56:56] together are you
[1:56:58] listening not calling people
[1:57:01] together but calling their
[1:57:05] bride together for the
[1:57:10] Rapture that is the
[1:57:13] shout and when when it is calling the
[1:57:17] people
[1:57:20] together because the Rapture is only for
[1:57:24] the
[1:57:27] bright it's not for other
[1:57:31] people you see I will tell
[1:57:35] you it
[1:57:37] says we have moved
[1:57:40] from Pentecostal
[1:57:44] age is where we have
[1:57:46] read he said now let me read in the
[1:57:49] middle first
[1:57:52] we are not living in the Methodist
[1:57:55] age the Baptist age we are living in the
[1:57:59] bright
[1:58:01] age in other words the age we are living
[1:58:05] in is the bright
[1:58:10] age that bright
[1:58:12] age it is a rupture
[1:58:18] aane and when you are in the bright age
[1:58:22] you are inside the
[1:58:25] AE you know the the
[1:58:28] shout is calling
[1:58:31] you is
[1:58:34] impossible to be a member of the
[1:58:39] Bride to be in the bright
[1:58:42] age but be left
[1:58:44] behind by The Rapture that is impossible
[1:58:53] if you are if you'll be left
[1:58:56] behind you are not in the
[1:59:00] bright you say you
[1:59:03] are but you are
[1:59:05] not because if you are
[1:59:09] there you'll never be left
[1:59:15] behind he says we are in the bright Age
[1:59:20] The Calling
[1:59:22] bring back to
[1:59:23] God through a
[1:59:26] channel that is promised to bring back
[1:59:31] in you other words the
[1:59:35] bright the bright is
[1:59:37] called by a certain
[1:59:43] Channel and that channel is known only
[1:59:46] by the
[1:59:48] bride just like that story of that EET
[1:59:54] it was that iglet
[1:59:58] only that could hear the voice of its
[2:00:04] mother that that is a special
[2:00:08] voice it was a special
[2:00:12] voice only only meant for
[2:00:16] thatl that when that voice
[2:00:20] echoed voice
[2:00:23] that e start to wonder what is
[2:00:26] happening but the chickens were
[2:00:29] there they didn't worry about the
[2:00:34] voice The Voice might have terrorized
[2:00:40] them this what is
[2:00:44] happening sometimes when you talk about
[2:00:46] the
[2:00:48] underworld ter something
[2:00:53] but according to the
[2:00:57] prophet he says this is the third
[2:01:02] pool because the third pool of
[2:01:05] Jesus it is when he preached to the
[2:01:08] soul that were in
[2:01:11] prison which cannot be saved
[2:01:15] anymore the third pool of
[2:01:18] Noah it was when Noah was inside
[2:01:24] and the AR was
[2:01:26] closed no one could caner
[2:01:31] in you see those men who were in prison
[2:01:37] there who Jesus went to testify
[2:01:41] to they say they were
[2:01:45] preachers during Noah's
[2:01:49] time they were trying to tell people
[2:01:53] that Noah is
[2:01:56] right but the way he's building the
[2:01:59] ark it's just out of
[2:02:04] mind they were
[2:02:07] preaching they they the prophet says
[2:02:09] they
[2:02:12] denied the Covenant
[2:02:16] vow the Covenant
[2:02:19] vow was the message of Noah
[2:02:24] to deny that it was denying what God
[2:02:32] Said bringing the
[2:02:36] bride in a
[2:02:39] channel the
[2:02:43] shout he
[2:02:45] said we are not living in Pentecostal
[2:02:48] age we are living in another age you are
[2:02:52] not living in a Methodist
[2:02:54] age we are living in another age we are
[2:02:57] living up here to the bright
[2:03:01] age the calling out of the
[2:03:06] church getting it
[2:03:09] together for the
[2:03:13] Rapture this
[2:03:15] message was calling certain group of
[2:03:19] people
[2:03:23] are you together but it was not this
[2:03:27] this one
[2:03:29] only because each
[2:03:32] age it has its own
[2:03:38] elect you see this Aeroplane of
[2:03:42] ours the Aeroplane
[2:03:46] Rapture it started in the Old Testament
[2:03:52] taking people people getting
[2:03:56] inside but when it comes to our
[2:04:00] us the Gentiles it started with the the
[2:04:04] first
[2:04:06] church it was the first
[2:04:08] station in other words in during our
[2:04:11] gentle
[2:04:14] dispensation it had seven
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:18] stations in each station station it was
[2:04:22] taking the
[2:04:24] members the elected ones pass of the
[2:04:29] Bride in that
[2:04:34] aane the Rapture started
[2:04:38] there going
[2:04:40] up in each age they were
[2:04:47] elect elect of
[2:04:49] God who were Tak into that
[2:04:54] a until it comes to our
[2:05:01] age this is the bright
[2:05:06] age that age that we are living in
[2:05:09] now to my honest
[2:05:14] opinion that is exactly the
[2:05:18] truth that is what the prophet says
[2:05:23] it is it is the the we the seat
[2:05:28] H we shall come back to that God
[2:05:32] willing then in this bright
[2:05:37] age there is the Bible
[2:05:41] says the
[2:05:46] will why because he says where there is
[2:05:50] a Cass
[2:05:54] the Eagles will
[2:05:55] [Music]
[2:05:57] gather then when we want to know what is
[2:06:00] the
[2:06:03] ccass the prophet says the ccass is the
[2:06:07] word of the
[2:06:12] season is the
[2:06:15] man it's the hidden
[2:06:17] man because Mana must be fresh
[2:06:23] it must not for last day or
[2:06:26] whatever it must be
[2:06:30] fresh where the carcass
[2:06:33] is the Eagles gather
[2:06:37] there we we are bound
[2:06:41] together because the Cass is
[2:06:45] there and then the prophet
[2:06:48] says then we are feeding
[2:06:53] feeding on the
[2:06:55] Cass we are invited to come and
[2:07:01] eat so that we can get
[2:07:05] power to
[2:07:08] fly he said we are feeding on the body
[2:07:15] word of the son of
[2:07:19] man which is our
[2:07:22] [Music]
[2:07:26] he says here if you haven't F
[2:07:31] fully on every
[2:07:33] word to give yourself strength to
[2:07:38] Fly Above All these
[2:07:43] denominations and things of the
[2:07:45] world will you at this
[2:07:49] time do it we
[2:07:56] pray identify the
[2:08:01] Cass you cannot identify the
[2:08:05] C if there is no
[2:08:11] teacher there must be a
[2:08:16] teacher who is bringing that Cass
[2:08:25] you can't just say I'm eating the
[2:08:30] Cass if you have not
[2:08:36] identified the true
[2:08:41] teacher who is giving you that
[2:08:44] [Music]
[2:08:46] Cass are you together with
[2:08:48] me I want to read something for you
[2:08:53] that you must hear that is the
[2:08:57] prophet he says
[2:08:59] now the coming is so imminent in the
[2:09:03] book
[2:09:08] Oneness the second coming of
[2:09:11] Jesus is gathering is elected
[2:09:16] together I believe they come from east
[2:09:20] west
[2:09:24] where the Cass
[2:09:27] is the Eagles will
[2:09:31] get oh my what is
[2:09:34] it is God his
[2:09:38] Oneness showing himself among
[2:09:43] them do you understand what he
[2:09:46] say he calling his elected together
[2:09:51] in Oneness with
[2:09:54] himself with the same kind of
[2:09:58] ministry he
[2:10:00] had you know I sh I you know I shaped in
[2:10:05] the church
[2:10:09] ages not long
[2:10:11] ago about the big
[2:10:16] tower that was
[2:10:19] built called the pyramid
[2:10:22] but the headstone was never put on
[2:10:28] it remember how the Lutheran
[2:10:32] came
[2:10:34] the in
[2:10:36] minority then down to the
[2:10:39] Pentecost now what what is he
[2:10:42] doing calling from
[2:10:45] that he he called out the elect
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:53] to make the
[2:10:55] lutherans he called out the
[2:10:58] elect out of the
[2:11:00] Lutheran to make the
[2:11:02] W he called out the elect out of
[2:11:06] that to make the
[2:11:10] Pentecostal now he is calling the elect
[2:11:13] from the
[2:11:17] Pentecostals to make the headstone
[2:11:22] to come into
[2:11:24] it when it comes to
[2:11:27] that the prophet
[2:11:29] said this one I don't know let me go to
[2:11:34] the
[2:11:36] west but remain looking
[2:11:41] inside he said they went
[2:11:44] West to get the the
[2:11:48] mystery of this one White
[2:11:52] Stone when he was coming back
[2:11:56] there he was
[2:11:58] bringing the
[2:12:00] headstone The Headstone
[2:12:03] [Music]
[2:12:07] Ministry are you to together
[2:12:10] the when when the
[2:12:13] message go out of West West
[2:12:18] W from the West Church
[2:12:23] those who remain
[2:12:25] there they're eating a rotten
[2:12:29] thing they are called the
[2:12:34] vultures because the weight has
[2:12:41] moved when the word moves
[2:12:44] there when you remain there you become a
[2:12:48] vulture
[2:12:53] what is it with God sent
[2:13:01] teacher they will stay right with the
[2:13:05] word to the real
[2:13:08] church not move one
[2:13:12] other no matter what an organization
[2:13:17] says they are not connected with it
[2:13:23] not make
[2:13:25] belief but genuine Prophet with the
[2:13:31] Lord he has placed with
[2:13:35] them true
[2:13:39] teacher through
[2:13:41] prophets who stay with the
[2:13:43] word who stay with the
[2:13:46] Bible my sheep hear my
[2:13:49] voice she said
[2:13:51] Jesus if that was his voice
[2:13:56] then hey are you together if it was his
[2:14:03] voice it must be his voice
[2:14:09] now we don't have a pastor a pastor is
[2:14:13] Jesus
[2:14:16] himself but if we see Jesus in a man
[2:14:21] we said that is a
[2:14:25] [Applause]
[2:14:29] pastor that's why he says he placed
[2:14:34] them with true
[2:14:39] teachers so that they can get the
[2:14:43] weight so that they can get this
[2:14:47] Cass so that they can be fat
[2:14:52] so that they can get
[2:14:56] power if that was his voice
[2:14:59] then is this voice now anything contr to
[2:15:04] that
[2:15:05] voice anything contrary to that
[2:15:09] voice is not sheep's
[2:15:13] foot and they won't follow
[2:15:19] it amen it is what he is feeding
[2:15:25] them so that they can receive
[2:15:29] power to
[2:15:32] fly now it is the seed
[2:15:39] age seed has become seed
[2:15:44] again what do we
[2:15:48] need because
[2:15:51] when you are sewing the
[2:15:54] seat you take care of it you water
[2:15:59] it when it has reached
[2:16:02] maturity you stop
[2:16:06] watering you don't need da
[2:16:10] anymore during seven
[2:16:13] church it was the this the Son of
[2:16:18] God the Holy Spirit
[2:16:24] watering it was water
[2:16:28] watering but at the end
[2:16:30] there we get to the seat
[2:16:35] again we don't need
[2:16:39] water there is another
[2:16:42] dispensation the
[2:16:44] anointing it's just like the anointing
[2:16:47] at Jordan
[2:16:51] we are anointed by
[2:16:54] [Music]
[2:16:56] himself we we have receive the owner of
[2:17:00] the gifts The Giver of the
[2:17:06] gifts we don't need any gift
[2:17:09] now because we have
[2:17:13] received the
[2:17:19] giver when you need
[2:17:23] orange you must plant orange
[2:17:28] tree then you'll
[2:17:31] have then now the
[2:17:34] anointing is that of start of the
[2:17:40] Loos
[2:17:43] amen he the prophet says
[2:17:46] now he says I am hearing something
[2:17:51] the coming of the
[2:17:56] cumbine the
[2:17:59] harves but I'm hearing it is
[2:18:04] coming is said the harves
[2:18:10] machine hey don't forget I'm talking
[2:18:13] about
[2:18:17] Rapture the harest machine
[2:18:23] is after
[2:18:24] harvesting then the elevator will take
[2:18:32] place to pick
[2:18:35] up let me just read
[2:18:40] something um in this book
[2:18:44] here I'm not going to be
[2:18:48] long as you know
[2:18:52] it
[2:18:53] says page 8 mod events
[2:19:00] 44 he says
[2:19:02] here the Shar held
[2:19:07] it but now the Shar pulls
[2:19:18] away it has remember 20 years has

[2:19:43] never make
[2:19:47] denomination but he's talking to the
[2:19:49] bright
[2:19:51] the Rapture the Rapture
[2:19:56] material they will they will never make
[2:20:01] denomination when a person moves from
[2:20:03] another Pastor to to form a
[2:20:10] p that's those we don't talk about those
[2:20:15] things you see you have to humble
[2:20:18] yourself
[2:20:23] if you don't humble
[2:20:25] yourself do you want somebody to Humble
[2:20:27] to himself to
[2:20:32] [Music]
[2:20:34] you whom are you going to
[2:20:39] teach you refuse to be

[2:20:53] what what do you
[2:20:55] need all right let's go
[2:20:57] on he
[2:21:01] says I say there's no time for
[2:21:06] denomination the wheat has taken
[2:21:12] shape but what the matter with the weat
[2:21:17] now it must lay in the presence of the
[2:21:22] sun to
[2:21:25] ripen before the combine picks it
[2:21:31] up now the event that was taking
[2:21:36] place
[2:21:38] is is absolutely showed in the
[2:21:43] Bible of every
[2:21:48] age he says now
[2:21:51] I'm hearing something
[2:21:54] here let me read what he's
[2:21:59] hearing he says I'm hearing something
[2:22:02] coming it's
[2:22:06] coming and when it is
[2:22:08] coming it means time is no
[2:22:13] more you see the
[2:22:16] combine combine is the World Council of
[2:22:19] churches
[2:22:21] [Music]
[2:22:25] he says so the prophet says
[2:22:28] so he says he's going to shave it
[2:22:35] away it's going to take it out from
[2:22:39] the he says but thank God the grain is
[2:22:43] going
[2:22:46] on then if that is true by the word of
[2:22:49] God
[2:22:52] to where we are
[2:22:53] living that is true by
[2:22:57] nature is
[2:22:59] indicated the corn of whe
[2:23:03] everywhere how much longer we
[2:23:07] got you know what I hear the coming of
[2:23:10] the
[2:23:13] kumb the world
[2:23:16] canel she will
[2:23:18] separate in other words this
[2:23:21] kumb will separate the
[2:23:23] Shar the the wheat from the
[2:23:29] Shar she will separate
[2:23:32] it what does she do shape her off the
[2:23:39] stock but she is she's got an elevator
[2:23:45] waiting for her she will go home
[2:23:50] after she is
[2:23:53] shaven then she the weed will be placed
[2:23:56] in the
[2:23:59] elevator and the elevator will take it
[2:24:03] home which is the
[2:24:07] rapture are you together
[2:24:09] with he says she will go
[2:24:13] home one of this
[2:24:16] money yes you
[2:24:18] understand say Amen
[2:24:21] amen that is what the prophet is
[2:24:25] saying he says he will shave
[2:24:31] it the wheat is
[2:24:35] here thank be to
[2:24:37] God the wheat is
[2:24:42] here but I'm hearing the the sound of a
[2:24:48] kumbai
[2:24:52] the harvesting
[2:24:55] machine what is that harvesting
[2:24:58] machine we have said this the world CC
[2:25:01] [Music]
[2:25:03] church here he says now remember there
[2:25:08] will be never an
[2:25:10] impersonation of
[2:25:13] that because it can't see it cannot
[2:25:19] be now it is
[2:25:22] inexistent he's talking about the
[2:25:25] thir and I and I am war of
[2:25:30] this right at this time
[2:25:33] now it's just
[2:25:36] happened so it could identify its
[2:25:39] presence among
[2:25:44] you see but it will not be used in a
[2:25:47] great way
[2:25:51] until this cancel begins to
[2:25:57] tighten when it
[2:25:59] does when
[2:26:02] does the pcal and so
[2:26:05] for in other words when they start to TI
[2:26:08] in he said but when that time
[2:26:13] comes when that squeeze comes
[2:26:16] down then you will
[2:26:18] see what you
[2:26:22] temporarily manifested in the fullness
[2:26:24] of
[2:26:27] his he say see four
[2:26:32] times in other words you
[2:26:35] see sometimes the
[2:26:38] squee brings something
[2:26:43] perfect bring something
[2:26:46] important if you want the the juice in
[2:26:49] the
[2:26:53] orange you have to squeeze it then when
[2:26:56] you squeeze it it will bring its
[2:27:02] juice during the
[2:27:05] squeeze then you will see what you have
[2:27:08] seen
[2:27:11] temporarily that is this
[2:27:13] squeeze it will be brought by the World
[2:27:17] Council of churches
[2:27:21] it is a
[2:27:23] tiing then when that time
[2:27:26] comes then that and the Press comes to a
[2:27:33] place where you are pressed
[2:27:37] out then watch what I am fixing to tell
[2:27:41] you in a few minutes wash the thir
[2:27:46] pool see it will be absolutely the total
[2:27:49] loss
[2:27:53] but it will be for the bride and the
[2:27:58] church that will be the
[2:28:03] tightening it will be the
[2:28:06] squeeze that squeeze it will be the
[2:28:09] harvesting
[2:28:12] Mach I'm not talking about that
[2:28:15] today I will talk
[2:28:17] about not soon
[2:28:31] not but
[2:28:33] we my my elders has talked about
[2:28:37] it the
[2:28:40] squeeze but let me say
[2:28:42] something he says it is already been
[2:28:48] formed this
[2:28:51] combine the harest
[2:28:54] Mach he say it has already been
[2:28:58] formed they are just waiting for the
[2:29:02] government what is
[2:29:04] remaining for them is to ask the
[2:29:09] government to ask the
[2:29:12] government to form a
[2:29:16] law which will force all
[2:29:21] to belong to
[2:29:24] it you see during Jesus
[2:29:27] time the the church
[2:29:30] people they hated
[2:29:32] him they wanted to do away with
[2:29:36] him but they didn't know how to
[2:29:40] do until they take
[2:29:42] him to the
[2:29:44] government so that the government can do
[2:29:48] away with him
[2:29:50] it will happen
[2:29:53] again the the the church
[2:29:57] people they are getting
[2:30:00] together they are they don't love
[2:30:03] us but they will make a
[2:30:12] [Applause]
[2:30:16] law but when those things happen
[2:30:20] it you must be
[2:30:24] happy because they are taking
[2:30:28] you to where you
[2:30:33] belong let me let me read my
[2:30:37] brother he says yeah he
[2:30:43] says this verse is not a declaration
[2:30:46] that the true church will go in will go
[2:30:49] in or through
[2:30:59] tribulation if it meant that it would
[2:31:01] have said
[2:31:05] that but it said I will keep thee from
[2:31:08] the hour of
[2:31:13] Temptation this temptation is exactly
[2:31:16] like the Temptation in Eden
[2:31:21] it will be a very inviting
[2:31:28] proposition held up in direct opposition
[2:31:34] to God's
[2:31:38] command but it will be
[2:31:43] inviting exactly
[2:31:46] amen and yet from the standpoint of
[2:31:49] human
[2:31:51] reasoning it will be so very
[2:31:55] right so
[2:31:59] enlightening and giving
[2:32:01] life as to full the
[2:32:06] well only the very
[2:32:09] elect will not be
[2:32:12] fooled the
[2:32:14] Temptation will come as
[2:32:16] follows the economical move
[2:32:22] that has started
[2:32:24] on what seems such a beautiful and
[2:32:28] blessed
[2:32:31] principle fulfilling Christ
[2:32:35] prayer that we all might be
[2:32:40] one become so strong
[2:32:44] politically that she best
[2:32:48] pressure upon the government
[2:32:51] to cause
[2:32:52] all to join with
[2:32:55] her either directly or in
[2:33:00] dire or through adherence to
[2:33:05] principles ined into the
[2:33:07] law so that no person will be
[2:33:13] recognized as an actual
[2:33:15] Church unless unless unless under Direct
[2:33:19] in direct domination of this
[2:33:27] C it is for
[2:33:30] me with this great
[2:33:33] power the church
[2:33:37] system will persecute the true the true
[2:33:43] bride this
[2:33:45] image will try to keep the bride from
[2:33:48] preaching
[2:33:49] [Music]
[2:33:52] and
[2:33:53] teaching
[2:33:54] Etc her ministers will be forbidden to
[2:33:58] give
[2:34:02] comfort and true to the
[2:34:04] people who need it but before the
[2:34:08] Antichrist in
[2:34:13] person Tak over this complete wealth
[2:34:16] system
[2:34:20] of of
[2:34:22] churches the true church will be taken
[2:34:26] away
[2:34:30] amen from this
