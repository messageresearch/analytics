[Music] Oh [Music] go [Music] never grow. Never grow. [Music] He never grow. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom. Um, just a little correction. I go by the name of &gt;&gt; the queen. Um, where do I even begin? &gt;&gt; Um, I first met SHZ in 2015 &gt;&gt; when I joined the visa SOS team. &gt;&gt; SOS. She was just another female colleague. Little did I know as the months go by we would be very close friends. I cannot really pinpoint when we became friends, &gt;&gt; but I must think it had to do with the character trait that she had. &gt;&gt; She had this character trait of asking the weirdest questions. Those questions that one in the world would say one in the world will says kind of witchcraft questions. &gt;&gt; Where do you come from? &gt;&gt; Where do you stay? &gt;&gt; What did you used to come here? &gt;&gt; Which route are you using? But no, it wasn't that. It's because she cared. &gt;&gt; And because of that beautiful smile, &gt;&gt; guess what I did? I answered all those questions. All of them. And every day she would check up on the previous questions answer. If I told her that's why I'm 5 minutes late &gt;&gt; today I'm 5 minutes late because the route I'm using had traffic. &gt;&gt; The next day she would asked did you use a different route? &gt;&gt; So you understand when I'm saying she asked because she cared. She was a character of note [Music] &gt;&gt; at times. I thought perhaps she just wants to show off, &gt;&gt; especially when it came to this other character trait because I would wake up 4:00 in the morning, get ready for work and make sure that I'm at work 7 by 7, which And then he'll be asking &gt;&gt; and then I'm saying you ask &gt;&gt; Sharon wake up at 6 &gt;&gt; and she'll come to work. &gt;&gt; She would look like she's the one who woke up and then she had this character of procrastinating. &gt;&gt; It's like she had all the time in the world. And I always thought, how do you do it? &gt;&gt; This one time this character and then I realized this character can't handle it is when I had to drive in the same car with her. &gt;&gt; She was the driver. You'll understand why she was the driver. Michael Schumacher has got nothing on her on our way cuz we were rushing somewhere as &gt;&gt; we stopped by chicken licking. H &gt;&gt; it's not a paid sponsor by the way. &gt;&gt; Uh we grabbed a few wings. Our tradition was that we add extra hot sauce [Music] that day. Remember she's driving. I couldn't even eat more than two. I felt them so hot. &gt;&gt; When we were at the robot, she asked cuz that's what she used to call me. &gt;&gt; That's how she called her. &gt;&gt; Why aren't you eating? &gt;&gt; I said, "These things are too hot." &gt;&gt; When we arrived where we were going, &gt;&gt; she said, "Let me have some of those wings." She ate the first one. &gt;&gt; She said, "No, give me some more hot sauce." &gt;&gt; Said, "These things are not hot." &gt;&gt; It's because you were not driving. Have you seen your self drive? &gt;&gt; But nonetheless, she always made sure we were okay. She always made sure we were okay. One thing I know we all going to take from her life, she was never too busy for to ask the questions. the questions that would make you feel or she cares about you. She says would be busy swamped with work in the office. But when you pass by her office, &gt;&gt; she won't allow you just to pass by. &gt;&gt; She would say my person &gt;&gt; baby. Yes, &gt;&gt; she had a name for everyone. &gt;&gt; She would make sure that you acknowledge because she wanted to check on you. She always had time to sneak in her tight hug and give us a kiss on the cheek and she would continue to encourage you no matter what we move. So if I had all the time, there would still be so many stories that I can unfold to tell you about this amazing about this amazing woman. But because of time, I will just stop here. But before we go, I would like to say these words. Blessing. &gt;&gt; Blessing. &gt;&gt; I'm still Auntie Mo. &gt;&gt; I'm still Auntie Mo. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Madam, I still got you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Auru God bless you. Bless the colleagues. Amen. And then we're going to speech number six. Tributes by colleagues that is Cades Oh my. Oh, [Music] we are la. [Music] I am. [Music] &gt;&gt; No, my no. [Music] [Music] Let me greet everyone. I'm requesting other colleagues they should come a [Music] from SOS. I'm from SOS. I'm standing in a position which is above myself. It was supposed to be late. &gt;&gt; She's saying she's running a bit late. Amen. We are coming to say to the family, we have lost all of us. We remember Sharon because of her works in the big office, &gt;&gt; the office that works with finances at school. Sharon made sure that when she's doing her work, she'll do it slowly but surely. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's Sharon. &gt;&gt; When she called me, she'll say, "My big sister." &gt;&gt; And then I'll say, "My younger sister." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must go well. We worked well with you. Up and downs even though we had up and downs. Life is just like this SOS who are family and we sent to the family. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he he fulfills his words and then the words of the speaker. He says there's a time to sow and then there's a time to reap. There's a time to be born &gt;&gt; and there's a time to depart and now this is the time that arrive with those words as a family. &gt;&gt; We say be comforted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, the colleagues God bless you. Then we proceed to item number seven, tribute. It's a rap Titus. I'll ask him as well to come and present his speech. Amen. We are [Music] so [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The one standing here is Moses. I'm the grandfather to the children. We been the family. We like to thank the program director and our pastors and the whole congregation in house. We thank you for after hearing the announcement. You left everything that is important and you came to support us. We as the family we like to thank you. Um, &gt;&gt; I'll speak about Sheron a bit. &gt;&gt; I will say we grew up together. We were very close. &gt;&gt; After hearing that, she departed because I know I was heard because I knew she didn't get sick. Because being the will of God, there's nothing much we can do. We should just accept God knows much above us. We are thankful grandchildren and blessed blessing &gt;&gt; is God who knew and I know for a fact because I saw how close you guys We are not going anywhere. We are here as a family and we will always be here. [Music] We are here with you as family. Let us accept that Sharon departed. &gt;&gt; Yes, I know it's difficult, &gt;&gt; but it is the will of God. [Music] Thankful the support, people who are coming from far near, the people who spoke before me, even those who will speak after we are thankful. &gt;&gt; It amazes me before me that I hear from the people who spoke before me, they spoke well about her &gt;&gt; especially because I didn't know that side of her. So we are thankful for you to letting us know how what kind of a person she was including by that to thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh, God bless you. God bless you, my brother. As I welcome sister Peta with a special song. Praise God. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hey [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Music] rewell. [Music] [Music] Oh hallelujah. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] I [Music] could see [Music] this sister. [Music] Oh god. [Music] Oh. Oh. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Applause] Says all [Music] [Music] [Applause] God bless you. God bless you. [Applause] Then we going to item number eight, tributes by children. I will ask them to come. be. [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; All right. [Music] &gt;&gt; All right. They requesting me to start with the tribute by siblings to come first. Amen. [Music] And the way he say [Music] the way he said He made it. He said the way he said he [Music] [Music] would like to greet everyone in the name of Jesus. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It is difficult to stand here. &gt;&gt; But we thank God because of the life of sister Sheron. &gt;&gt; She was really a loving person. When I came to family, &gt;&gt; like the other sisters, we were never treated like [Music] She was our sister. She was our big sister. She was our pillar. Everything that happens in the family. She's the one who led us. We always followed her instructions. So preparing for this funeral was a bit hectic. because she was not there but everything but we thank God. &gt;&gt; Yes. She celebrated all the milestones. Especially birthdays not only for herself but because she bought us gifts always even a message. in the morning she will be even when other people will forget she'll be there to send a message to say hey everybody in the family is a birthday of someone and we will always celebrate because she loved God she saved We thank God because she came to us all of us being children. &gt;&gt; She was the greatest. We thank the love that she showed to us, &gt;&gt; not only her family but everybody else. So we say &gt;&gt; uh I always think of a song that says when we depart when we surrender apart it gives us inward pain. Yes, we felt the pain, &gt;&gt; but something is comforting us because we will definitely meet again, everybody. &gt;&gt; With that, I'm thankful to everyone &gt;&gt; and God. &gt;&gt; May he keep us together, &gt;&gt; united in his love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. [Applause] Uh also let me greet the saints in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ and also extend my greetings to the dignitaries and our our leaders. I've seen uh several principal that my sister served under. And uh I want to appreciate their support. I've been telling them that you are my uncle and they are here they see. So without waste of time, &gt;&gt; I would also just read a scripture for my sister. Uh she was my twin. H &gt;&gt; many of you you don't know. H I was born in 1985. 1985 &gt;&gt; on the 28th of August 28th August &gt;&gt; and my sister was born in 1981 &gt;&gt; on the 28th of August 28th. &gt;&gt; So when she departed even myself something departed from me I will never be the same again I'm shattered. I was telling my brother Tapel that maybe it was supposed to be one of us. We are many boys and men are together. So she was the cushion between us. Yeah. When that friction starts, I have lost again that feminish part. We will never be the same again. But we are consoled as the pastor preached yesterday. We are consoled. So I'll just touch two things and then I'm out here. Uh my sister one day we applied a visa. The pastor was invited in America. &gt;&gt; So we went to the consul at Santin for interview. It was me, my mother and my sister. them they were successful. I was rejected to go to United Stateates. I failed the interview. Brother Mande was telling me that actually you failed before you go. Already they perused your profile. So she went, she had a privilege to go to the land that the prophet was born. So I'm proud of her because she sacrificed every cent as my brother said for this ministry h with those words family friends colleagues our our fellow church members. Thank you. Thank you for everything. I have a big family cannot die. She has sister Sheron cannot die. We see him in you because she's she was a saint. So a saint doesn't die but she sleeps. Let me read this scripture. The book of Isaiah chapter 57. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 57. I will read only verse one verse one and two. The righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart and the merciful man are taken away. None considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come. He shall enter into peace. They shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness. So she died very young. My sister, she was 44 years old. [Music] &gt;&gt; To my nephews and niece, I I'm here. H if if I had to choose again, Which family would I want to be born? And then who will be your parents? I'll still choose Albert and Esther and sister Sharon will I will still choose to be my sister. What a what a family that fear God above all. So may God console us. Thank you so much. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God bless the siblings and we proceed baselon. We calling the children now to come [Music] be away. Now [Music] in [Music] the [Music] Shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Today we celebrate my mother's life. &gt;&gt; Mama never wanted us to call her mama. We called her &gt;&gt; girl. &gt;&gt; I will cherish her guidance, support and unconditional love. Ashes was my rock. Ashes was my rock. Her love, wisdom, and compassion touched countless lives. &gt;&gt; I'm grateful for the memories and lessons we shared. You have run your race, mama. We will miss you. Truly made up in the sky. [Applause] Shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Mama was one of a kind. &gt;&gt; She was a bubbly person, selfless and full of life. She loved God wholeheartedly. And if ever you heard her laughter, you know how contagious it was. She had a way of giving even when she said she didn't have anything. &gt;&gt; When I turned 21, mama went all out. She celebrated me like a queen. [Music] If there's one title that she wore with confidence with confidence and pride, &gt;&gt; If there's one title she wore with confidence and pride, &gt;&gt; it was she didn't just carry the name, she lived it. &gt;&gt; She would always bring something for the little ones. Mama always wanted me and her to graduate in the same year. Mama and &gt;&gt; she was supposed to graduate on the 3rd of June. &gt;&gt; Although she won't walk across that stage in a cap and gown. [Music] I believe she received a far greater reward in heaven. one that no earthly ceremony could ever match. What I'll miss the most with mama is sharing the word of God with her and the late night talks that we always had. And lastly, to my siblings, I know this pain cuts deep. as we've lost our pillar, our cheerleader, and our biggest supporter. But I want to remind you of the same God that mama reminded us so many times. I I want I also want you guys to remember the path that she took. &gt;&gt; And I'm also saying, let's walk through the same path. until the day God remembers us. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah God bless the children. God richly bless them. Amen. And then we coming to the reading of the obituary whose labu will come as we all stand on our feet. Amen. Can you do media? Before I read the obituary, um I'm just going to like to um kill two birds with one stone. I just want to pray a short tribute by a set by John Doe. Death be not proud. Death be not proud. Though some have called thee mighty and dreadful, thou art not so. For those whom thou thinkst thou art to overthrow, die not, poor death, nor yet const, thou kill me, from rest and sleep, but which thy pictures be. Much pleasure then from thee much more must flow. And soonest our best men with thee do go. rest of their bones and souls delivery. Though art slave to fate, chance kings and desperate men and dosed with poison, war and sickness dwell, and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well, and better than thy stroke. Why swast though then? One short sleep past, we wake eternally and death shall be no more. Death though shall die.

People can speak nice ways but there is no way it can enter the hearts of a man except the word of God. God is the creator of man. is the one who knows how to comfort. And that is the reason we are here with the word of God knowing that perhaps God will comfort the family. While standing on our feet, I'm happy to have pastors here and the elders here. I am also greeting them. I'm happy to have them here. Then while standing on our feet, I'm not going to take a long time. Perhaps I'll give the time back to the chorus leader to give us some songs so that perhaps he may console us with those songs because I'm not the long man. I'm a short man. Then we read the book of uh the first Thessalonians. &gt;&gt; We read uh chapter 4. &gt;&gt; Chapter 4. &gt;&gt; We read from verse 13 to 16. &gt;&gt; 13- 13 to 18. &gt;&gt; Oh, 13. &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians 4 13-8. But I will not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with this. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. for Amen. Amen. foreign. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. We may take our seats. When we are taking our seats, my brother, we read the book of Genesis chapter 4, chapter 23. 23 &gt;&gt; uh verse 9. &gt;&gt; Verse 9. that he may give me the cave of Macapella which he hath which is in the end of his field. For as much money as it is worth, he shall give it to me for a possession of a bearing place amongst you. &gt;&gt; Um I I just want to talk about something here. Uh this is the topic I want to talk about is the identified burial place of the seed of the royal seed of Abraham living here on Earth. We know we are going to die. But what we don't know is when we are going to die, how we are going to die, where we are going to die. But death We know we are going to die. &gt;&gt; And we have said death has no reason &gt;&gt; and death you cannot stop it. You can stop disease but not death because death is not caused by disease. [Music] You can just die even if you are not sick. &gt;&gt; Therefore, you can stop death. &gt;&gt; You can stop disease but not death. [Music] You can't uh um cure death. &gt;&gt; You cannot diagnose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Death. &gt;&gt; If somebody can say I can stop death, tell that person you are a liar. No one &gt;&gt; who can stop death. Death is just the death. &gt;&gt; But I told you that is separation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Separation of men with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is what you call death. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when I leave this body, It's not death. &gt;&gt; But because we are used to say is death then we say he he has died but it's not death. [Music] &gt;&gt; You are born being dead. Because &gt;&gt; you cannot say you are living &gt;&gt; if you don't have God. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A man who can kill his wife with an X is not the normal man. He is dead. &gt;&gt; We are living with people &gt;&gt; and you cannot solve that. Government is making laws trying to solve the dead people. You cannot solve them because these people are dead. They are not in their normal. You cannot be normal without God. The burial, the identified the place of burial of the seed of Abraham. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Blessed are the dead who died in Christ. In other words, while we are still living here, we must identify our burial place. Because the Bible says, "Blessed are the dead who die in Christ." [Applause] They are already buried in Christ. Then they have identify their burial place. Hallelujah. But let me go back to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Abraham when his wife has died, &gt;&gt; he went to a place. &gt;&gt; He being a prophet, &gt;&gt; he identify the burial place of his wife. by revelation. &gt;&gt; He identify &gt;&gt; as a burial place. &gt;&gt; Then if you are a royal seed of Abraham, &gt;&gt; we can say who are the royal seed of Abraham? [Applause] They are the people who have got the faith of Abraham. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Those are the royal seed of Abraham. But Paul says, &gt;&gt; if you are in Christ, then you are the seed of Abraham. In our to qualify to be the seed of Abraham, you must be in Christ. Then if you are in Christ, &gt;&gt; then you are the seed of Abraham. And if you are the seed of Abraham, you must have you must identify your burial your burial place because Abraham by faith by revelation he identified his bearing place being [Applause] he bought that piece of land to be his land where he can bury his people. He started burying his wife there and he also was buried there and his son Isaac was buried there. Jacob was buried there and others were buried there. Even Joseph said when he was in Egypt, he said when I have died, You must not bury me here, but you must keep my bones. Then when you move, you must take my bones and you must go and bury me there because we have got a bur burial place there. Joseph's bones. Joseph's bones &gt;&gt; were the memorial of to this people that they are going to move from this place because Joseph said when you move here don't leave my bones [Applause] because living you are going to leave when they look at the bones these bones gave them faith it was encouragement to death that we are going to move here one of the good days. [Applause] Why Abraham choose this place as his burial place is because Abraham being a prophet he had identified that job was buried here. I him I must be buried where Jo was buried. Jo was buried there at Abraham has identified that place by revelation because he was a prophet. Why then Abraham wanted to be buried where Job was buried? It was because Abra job saw has seen the the resurrection. He has seen that I'm going to die. He said even if the the worms can eat this body, can you read it for me, my brother? I I I believe is 19. Let me see here. I believe it's Job 19 there verse 25. Let's just read it. Let's see. &gt;&gt; For I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroyed this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. Even if the skin worms can eat this boat of life, but yet with my own eyes, I will see God, he saw the resurrection. [Music] Then Abraham knew that this man has seen the resurrection. He wanted to be he want to be part of job. He want to be buried where Job was buried and they were buried there and exactly what what he had believed. Jesus was born and after his birth he grew and he preached and he died there. And when he when he died, he was buried. When he was buried, then he resurrected. &gt;&gt; When he resurrected, &gt;&gt; but let me say this. When he died, his body was placed in a grave. His spirit went to God. His soul went to hell. Why hell? &gt;&gt; To preach to the souls who were in hell who didn't believe during the message of Noah. And those people who were in hell there were messengers. They were preachers. They were pastors in those days. They were preaching when Noah was preaching, but they didn't believe the message of Noah. They were preaching something against what Noah was. They were preachers and Jesus went to preach to them to testify that I I am the one who has seen Noah. I was the one who was preaching then you refused me. [Applause] That that was the third pool of the ministry of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; The third pool of the ministry of Jesus is when he preach to the lost soul. If this ministry, if this ministry of the seventh angel messenger, if this seventh angel messenger, it must it must also be the same ministry of that of that of of Jesus. Is the same minister the pool. It must to be to the soul. And he preached that the souls that are imprisoned now because it was the same ministry. [Applause] [Music] Evil ministry if the ministry we have received is the same as the ministry of the seventh angel message they must preach the souls that if your ministry don't reach that state it has come short [Applause] [Music] if it is the ministry of chief it The third pool of that ministry, it must go to the soul that cannot repent. [Music] Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When when the Bible says &gt;&gt; he went there. &gt;&gt; When you read first Peter, I think so. chapter 3 verse 19. I'm I'm not going to read it. &gt;&gt; J Jesus went there &gt;&gt; to preach. After he had preached, &gt;&gt; he he resur he went to he he moved from hell and he went to paradise. &gt;&gt; Amen. You must know in those days &gt;&gt; paradise &gt;&gt; paradise &gt;&gt; it was a place &gt;&gt; where was divided by a a donga like [Music] the the people who are in hell &gt;&gt; and those who are in paradise. They could see one another. &gt;&gt; That's why the wish of endor could go there and pick up the soul of somewhere and bring it back because they were at the same because the wishes were controlling that place. but they couldn't control this one. But this one was next to this one because they they they are they were neighbors, they could talk to this one. [Applause] But when Jesus resurrected, &gt;&gt; when he when he moved from hell, &gt;&gt; he went to that place. &gt;&gt; Praise God. where Abraham &gt;&gt; and prophets &gt;&gt; and the saints the old saints where they were he went there. &gt;&gt; The Bible says when he reached that place each and everyone there identified him the way he had seen him. This man is the one I've seen in a bing bush. He said, &gt;&gt; Ezekiel said, &gt;&gt; this man was the wheel in the middle of the [Music] when they saw him. &gt;&gt; Is this not the fourth man? Each and everyone was identifying him by the way he saw him. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I am what you have seen." &gt;&gt; Come, let's go. &gt;&gt; Read Matthew 27. Matthew. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; 27:50. Let's see it. 2750 &gt;&gt; 27 start from verse 51 to 53 &gt;&gt; Matthew 27:51 and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose &gt;&gt; and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says &gt;&gt; those saints, &gt;&gt; the Bible says the graves were open. &gt;&gt; That is what they have seen. &gt;&gt; But the people were not in the graves. Amen. &gt;&gt; They were from paradise &gt;&gt; coming back with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When they come back with people saw griefs open because when you die here this body we we bury the body. &gt;&gt; When we bury It undergoes some restorations so that it must go back to the same body that Adam was putting on because when when we call when we talk about the resurrection, we don't talk about replacement. We we we talk about waking the same body which has fallen down. We we raise it again but in another form. It must have been transformed. It must have been undergone a system of transformation because this one is dead. It must be transformed. But the body which must be transformed it must be this one because when I raise it must be the same you are looking at it. It is not a replacement of &gt;&gt; they woke up. They get inside the city. They woke up all Job and others who were buried in Mabella because Mabella was a resurrection place. That's why Abraham wanted his wanted his people to be buried there. see that there will be a resurrection here and according to the book here. The resurrection happened there. [Applause] [Music] People were buried there. They were all resurrected and they went into the city. They move around the city for 40 days. People seen them and not seen them. They appear and disappear and disappear. [Applause] [Music] But people have seen them. &gt;&gt; They have been resurrected. When Jesus rise, when he ascend to heaven, the Bible said they ascended to heaven with him. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; If you were there, Yeah. Which side will you be in? All right. The Bible says &gt;&gt; they ascended to heaven. &gt;&gt; When they ascended up to heaven, they ascended up to heaven like a cloud. When the disciples look at them, that's what the Bible said. He has risen with a cloud. That cloud was those resurrected. The Bible says the way you are seeing him rising, he will come the same way. In other words, he'll come back with the saints again. He's rising with the saints. He will come back with the saints. The same way you are seeing him rising, he will come back. The same way because he rises the saints, he will come back with the saints. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; It's your Bible. &gt;&gt; I'm not speaking something which is not in the Bible. &gt;&gt; They resurrected, they with him. And the Bible says the same way you will see him rising he will come back the same way. And when we read in Luke he said he will come back in with clouds. Do you see it? where we have read &gt;&gt; the Bible says &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; is that for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again. Even so them also which slept in Jesus You know that they have identified their burial place. They are buried in Christ. &gt;&gt; That is what the Bible is saying here, my brother. Read something here. I'm I'm going to come back. Reap 14:3. Read it. Let's hear it. Revelation 14:3. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, write, blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth. Yeah. Saying, sayeth the spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them. &gt;&gt; Right. Say, Blessed are the dead who die in Christ for they are going to rest. You must identify the place where you want to be buried. Amen. Burial place. Why you are still living here? Identify your burial place. The Bible says here those who are buried in Christ they they are going they are going to rest. [Applause] [Music] He says, "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, them also who slept in Jesus will God bring with him. Who will he bring with him? those who are buried in him. If you baptize in his name, you you are buried with him. You die with him and you are buried with him. You are resurrected. Amen. Those who are buried in him, he will come with them. Amen. &gt;&gt; During what we call the first resurrection, &gt;&gt; Jesus will leave the seventh. Because when when they resurrected, when they rose again with him, he left them at the sixth dimension &gt;&gt; because paradise was destroyed. &gt;&gt; When paradise was destroyed, &gt;&gt; now it became two separate things. It was the fifth dimension which is hell. [Music] Hell &gt;&gt; is divided into three. &gt;&gt; That is hell. Those places are hell. &gt;&gt; The first place is where the souls of those who didn't believe They're unjust. &gt;&gt; They they go there when they die. &gt;&gt; The the second place is where demons are they operate from there. When they operate in space, they are they are operating from there. &gt;&gt; That is the head office. They move from there and operate in space and here on earth because the war is fought in space on earth and in water. Satan is also typing that. He's he's fighting in space. &gt;&gt; He's fighting on earth. He's fighting down there. in water. [Music] &gt;&gt; If you don't you don't believe it. I tell you, &gt;&gt; Satan is fighting in water. &gt;&gt; Is this dwelling place? Is this his office? [Applause] &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; When you move from the the second You go to the third. The third is where Satan himself dwell. &gt;&gt; All these places is hell. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Then we call the first one which is where the spirit of dust dwell. We call it the fifth dimension. But when you move from there, you go to where demons are. When you move from there, you go to where the Satan himself is. Thus the th man of God. When you go up, heaven is divided into three. There is the first heaven and the second heaven and the second. Satan Satan is copying. When God had three heavens, Satan said I will have three hell. When you move from here, &gt;&gt; you go to the first heaven. That is what we call the sixth dimension. Then you go to the seven, the second. &gt;&gt; Then you go to the the third &gt;&gt; where God dwell. Then we call it the seventh dimension. Jesus will move from the seven dimension and go to the sixth dimension during the first resurrection. Are you listening? I'm teaching you. [Applause] When things when one of us pass away, &gt;&gt; we teach one another. &gt;&gt; But if you happen to be where we teach one another, just listen and be taught. &gt;&gt; But the main aim is to teach one another. and encourage one another. When we are living here, we must know those who don't believe this message of ours, they are going there. And when because we believe this message, we are going there. We are separating here. This message is separating the word of God. brings a separation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Then when you will move from the the seven dimension and went to the sixth and pick the souls of the Russians of the saints who have passed away. When one of us pass away We believe that he's going there to the sixth dimension. He's going to rest &gt;&gt; waiting for those who go to the fifth dimension. &gt;&gt; It is a waiting trial. Please those who were once arrested. They know that &gt;&gt; after being arrested &gt;&gt; you go to jail but you are in jail and there you you are in trouble. You in pain WhatsApp. &gt;&gt; You get other thugs beating you up. You are waiting trial when you die. We are waiting trial for the fifth dimension. You're waiting for judgment. [Music] I'm I'm bringing judgment here. The Bible says I'm a judge. That is what the Bible says. I'm the church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At the second resurrection at the white throne judgment, God is just going to lay down the judgment. &gt;&gt; Because next because you've been you have already been judged. You go to hell. God &gt;&gt; because because as as you have been judged, &gt;&gt; you must go to hell for for &gt;&gt; forever for everlasting. It's not eternal. It's for everlasting. As you have been judged, you must just go to hell. As you have been judged, &gt;&gt; then you go to heaven. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; As you have been judged. &gt;&gt; Judgment is is presented here now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will take them. &gt;&gt; And bring and come with them. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when when he is between heaven and earth, &gt;&gt; Jesus will remain there. &gt;&gt; Christ will remain there. &gt;&gt; Then the saints who are in the sixth dimension, they will come down. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because we have got three bodies. This is the body we are wearing. &gt;&gt; The Bible say so. If this tabernacle be dissolved, we have another you must read the Bible. The Bible says if this earthly tabernacle a tabern is is a is a temporary shelter when the people children of Israel were moving from Egypt to Canaan they were living in tabernac they celebrated that feast in Canaan. And there remembering when they were still moving in are you together with me then because the Bible says if this means we are in a temporary shelter we are going that's why he says we have got a house. He doesn't know if we have got another tabernacle. He said you have got a house because now that one is not a tabernacle, it's a house. This one is a tabernacle. When it when the Bible speaks about tabernacles and house, it is it was speaking about bodies. is a house. The Paul say he says you we have got earthly earthly bodies and we have got heavenly bodies and he's calling this one a corrupt. This one is is mortal. But he's talking about another one which is incorruptible, which is immortal at this point. At this point, I'm trying to to to give you an appetite. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then this this this one &gt;&gt; in English they call it terrestrial terrestrial. &gt;&gt; And then when you move from this terrestrial if you go to another one is called the theophony which is the heavenly body. Then when you move from when when they come where we have right here when Jesus move from the seven coming to the in the sixth the the the saints which are there. They are in their theophanes theophanes. Then he will take them there in those theophanes. Then they will come here to pick up another body. They will take they will take another. This one is they were there in the theophanes. When they come here on earth, they going to take another body which is a glorified body. The body like that one of I can say to you That boot doesn't have another. &gt;&gt; Will you refuse or will you believe another connect with your mother? What is the in the in the glorified Buddhist? Oh, we don't we don't believe don't take it. Leave it. But I tell you, connect with your mother. But in the in that body, glorified body, what is the N used for? [Music] You have got the theophony. You have got the You have got the the theophony. &gt;&gt; Then you have got the glorified one. &gt;&gt; This this one &gt;&gt; we can touch. Work with it. But this one you cannot touch but you can see but you can hear but you cannot touch. This this theophony body. This what is the body that we loosed there? We loosed from Adam. There is the body created by God himself not born of a woman but created by God. God will create that body then will get into that body. Those who are still living here they will change this one. [Applause] All right. All right. All right. &gt;&gt; All right. Let me tell you &gt;&gt; living here. &gt;&gt; I told you the word of God. &gt;&gt; It is used as cells. Cell &gt;&gt; the cell &gt;&gt; because &gt;&gt; a cell &gt;&gt; upon a cell &gt;&gt; and it will make an organ &gt;&gt; from an organ it will make an organism then is the weight upon weight. Why are we still here preaching? Because we are building cells in you. It must be a cell upon a cell. Cell upon a cell until God is satisfied that the organism has been created in this age. Now those who have received this message, they've received their theophanes in them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 10. &gt;&gt; This angel coming down &gt;&gt; with a book is coming is bringing back the theophanes. What you have missed there? This seven angel messenger is bringing back into you. All right. All right. All right. Just listen here. When when he is coming with the saints which are which which are in their theophanes, they must find us here with our theophanis inside. We can we cannot change to another body. If we have if we don't have our theophony theophanes going to put on glorified body we don't we are not going to sh the theophanes theophanes are going to be put in a glorified body if you don't have a theophony then you don't have a glorified body that's why Because those have got their theophanes already. That's why God brought our theophanes in revelation chapter 10 which is the revelation of the seventh seal I man. [Music] [Applause] You cannot receive this the supernatural message &gt;&gt; because when our seven angel messenger went to west. &gt;&gt; He was going to connect [Music] &gt;&gt; with something. the same way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming back &gt;&gt; connected. &gt;&gt; That's why. He was coming with another commission and that commission will be only received &gt;&gt; or it will only be heard. Those who have their theophanes, &gt;&gt; they brought the theophanes &gt;&gt; so that you can be able They were they were preparing us for the message coming because beside that we wouldn't understand when they come in their theophony they must find those who have got theophony so they can change this bodies and take another [Music] That is the first reason I get are those who have identified &gt;&gt; their burial place which is in Christ. Amen. How do you become part of [Music] you? You become part of the family by marriage. [Applause] He brought the weight to propose you [Music] then because just You are predestinated. You you can hear this word. But this word is the word of my husband. That's why he calls those his sheep. He calls them his family members. Jesus himself, he said they are my brethren. Paul says he is the firstborn among his brethren that's why he is our brother. Then he has prepared them to be part. He proposed you this way. Then you accept the way and when you go to be baptized. It is a public testimony that I have received this man. Because if the man has proposed you that man says let us marry there is something wrong you because marriage is a public testimony when you propose one another you were together there no one was looking at you but we see when they tell us these two M and two that are going to marry on this such and such day. Then we come all and we're going to see the two in public [Applause] [Music] when you have had the weight then you must be baptized how in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin then you become that's why he said now I I I have to go to the Gentiles [Music] to take people for his name. I'm going to take them for the name. When you take When you take a woman, you take the woman to the name because he's take he's taking another name, [Applause] the name of Jesus Christ. He is Mrs. Jesus Christ in a supernatural she's already married but this is a supernatural one that's why the the marriage officer marriage officer when he was preaching he preached a certain book the invisible you know That is the invisible marriage. But we have got another visible one in the merry supper. But we go there because the invisible has already been done. [Music] Identify. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Identify you are buried while living here. You know, I'm I'm I'm I'm happy about these white people. When some if someone dies in the family, they come now, they take this, they actually want to find out what caused the death. Now, after finding the death, now they go back home. They going to vaccinate the remaining ones. Now I'm also vaccinating. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm the chorus leader. I said I'm going to allow you to just give us choruses so that you can console us with choruses &gt;&gt; whilst waiting for the hash. God bless you. Let's close our eyes &gt;&gt; to thank God for the message. Oh dear heavenly father, there is nothing we can present to your children &gt;&gt; beside what you have brought to us. &gt;&gt; You have given us something that is beyond human understanding. &gt;&gt; Is just in a supernatural form. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you have to you have said through your messenger when people have reached the sixth to go to the se the seventh into the king's chamber &gt;&gt; they need a challenger &gt;&gt; who will go and pick them &gt;&gt; because that step you cannot take it yourself. The last step you have brought when the pulpit when the pyramid was opened &gt;&gt; there was no one who could could get in into that could understand what it is into that. So the prophet said I must go to the west because someone must come and transfer us &gt;&gt; into that other pyramid. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord for your message &gt;&gt; and thank you for what you have done to us. &gt;&gt; This is by grace &gt;&gt; is not what man can do &gt;&gt; is what you have done to us. &gt;&gt; Bless each and every one of us here &gt;&gt; with the message preached. Amen. &gt;&gt; If there is anything which have gone out through the message we were preaching which is not from you, &gt;&gt; let it not get into the ears of your children &gt;&gt; because it's the aim of the devil &gt;&gt; to divert &gt;&gt; beautiful things which you want to bring to your children. &gt;&gt; Be with us with the family. be with each and every one of us here. &gt;&gt; I pray in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless. Hallelujah. Ah, God is good. Yeah. You see yesterday I say it's too supernatural. &gt;&gt; I'm ask which word I can use. Hallelujah. [Applause] Amen. Okay.
