[25:40] [Music]
[25:43] now I could yeah
[25:46] they wait
[25:48] in my book is Page 32s
[25:51] the spoken word is the original
[25:54] spoken what is the original seat
[25:59] now
[26:00] I know many results I see
[26:06] now I guess
[26:09] when you go out of this place they will
[26:11] not be remembering what the title is
[26:16] whether elderly or or young
[26:19] officials
[26:23] but they will not know what is the title
[26:29] the word
[26:32] they wait
[26:34] that was spoken the word that
[26:37] was spoken yeah
[26:39] but not from the pulpit a felon is
[26:43] we are going to look at the word
[26:47] that is not from the pulpiti
[26:51] because there's so many pulpits
[26:54] challenge
[26:57] and so many different types of
[27:02] mystery mystery no Mysteries and
[27:05] Ministries
[27:10] the Ministries
[27:12] now we have decided
[27:17] to hear from
[27:22] yes amen
[27:24] the spoken words
[27:32] and now this part says
[27:36] the weight now the weight that God spoke
[27:40] to multiply and replenish you know the
[27:43] code
[27:48] to replenish the Earth it it couldn't
[27:51] find a place to land on
[28:01] the way that God
[28:06] pasta
[28:08] God the Creator
[28:10] he spoke but that way
[28:14] could not find a place
[28:31] finally this word caught into the womb
[28:35] of a vision yeah
[28:42] meaning this word
[28:43] couldn't find a place
[28:50] amen amen it was coming from God
[28:56] but then
[28:59] according to the word yes
[29:01] before God you can
[29:05] or can utter or could speak anyway
[29:11] he must have first a field a place
[29:22] that's why the prophet speaks of the
[29:25] word that was spoken
[29:32] what happens if God speaks
[29:36] say Let There be lights
[29:39] and there was light wow
[29:43] now we call it the spoken word
[29:49] we call it
[29:51] the spoken words
[29:59] now every spoken word
[30:02] must have a manifestation
[30:08] right
[30:09] but spoken because he says come to Moses
[30:13] I want the people to know
[30:17] that I talked with you
[30:21] I talked with you Moses amen
[30:29] okay I mean
[30:31] now there's so many pulpits today
[30:34] finally
[30:37] I think we must go back to the original
[30:40] pulpits yesterday
[30:45] amen amen
[30:48] we see so many interpretations
[30:51] I think we should go back
[30:54] to the original one
[30:59] they're spoken
[31:03] okay I mean no he stays here this way
[31:07] Lynn Julie caught into the room of a
[31:09] video
[31:13] right then let's leave it here for a
[31:17] while
[31:21] no wonder
[31:23] there was there is another one part here
[31:29] where it says
[31:31] it is 152. 152.
[31:37] ages
[31:41] we did not become seed by the rebirth so
[31:49] we were sick
[31:52] and therefore
[31:54] were Reborn
[31:58] [Applause]
[32:04] you must watch things
[32:09] okay amen you won't go wrong
[32:14] okay
[32:16] we did not become sick
[32:24] I'm born again I'm born again
[32:35] because coward we don't become sick
[32:42] [Music]
[32:43] we were seed
[32:48] and therefore
[32:50] we are reborn
[32:54] [Applause]
[32:56] for only the elect can be reborn
[33:04] because
[33:11] so you plant the seeds
[33:14] then you see the rebirth
[33:19] amen amen
[33:22] so God created things
[33:26] already
[33:29] okay amen
[33:30] and
[33:33] we are preaching every day
[33:37] and the people come and hear the word of
[33:39] God
[33:41] but let me repeat to you
[33:45] not become seeds
[33:51] thank you
[33:52] [Applause]
[33:56] therefore surely
[34:01] we will see it
[34:10] to be reborn
[34:13] okay
[34:16] I've heard you
[34:18] right amen now
[34:21] this word
[34:24] that that's why it is called the spoken
[34:28] word
[34:30] couldn't find a place
[34:37] until
[34:38] finally my fellow this word caught
[34:45] into a prepared womb
[34:51] of a vision yeah hurry
[34:56] although they were young women in her
[34:59] time
[35:02] they could do that and do that
[35:07] because she was a special place
[35:13] for the word that was coming
[35:17] I am from God if God has prepared
[35:22] he will keep you
[35:25] [Applause]
[35:32] that is what we call predestination
[35:39] you know I was
[35:42] even reading something here
[35:46] this can surprise somebody
[35:50] about the Sun come over of the son the
[35:56] son of foreign
[36:31] she was the first one to arrive
[36:36] d
[36:40] and Sister Sister
[36:46] she looked like any other woman's sister
[36:51] but for the first time
[36:56] we have seen the third pool
[36:59] for the first time
[37:01] being manifested
[37:03] and that was Sister age
[37:07] [Music]
[37:10] okay
[37:14] there was a sister here
[37:17] or there is a system when
[37:20] [Music]
[37:22] I may be away from home
[37:26] because I can't carry the whole
[37:29] books of spoken word with me Linda
[37:36] but if then
[37:38] I will be in need of spoken words
[37:44] if that sister is around
[37:46] I would know that I'm going to get to
[37:49] that
[37:54] all right
[37:56] yeah I'm looking at this
[38:02] why why sisters

[38:10] massage
[38:12] that is the bride
[38:14] of Christ
[38:17] okay amen now let me read you something
[38:20] interesting

[38:47] going to live together
[38:52] eternally we are feeling
[38:54] okay
[38:56] and
[38:59] let me come to this one
[39:03] Mary was that word
[39:07] he was that place
[39:10] for the word that God spoke
[39:18] not from the
[39:20] the word she received
[39:22] he was not the weight from the pulpits
[39:29] today
[39:31] we come to church
[39:34] sometimes we just hear the word
[39:40] but nowadays
[39:42] we want to hear the word from God
[39:50] because
[39:52] things are the way they are because of
[39:55] the words from the pulpit
[40:05] as Moses
[40:08] told them
[40:10] God spoke
[40:12] she has spoken
[40:15] from
[40:17] [Music]
[40:18] Heaven amen it's not me Moses
[40:26] [Music]
[40:28] foreign
[40:57] Isaiah 50
[40:59] 5. amen verse 11 then more verse 11.
[41:03] okay 55 11.
[41:05] so shall my weight be that going forth
[41:08] out of my mouth it shall not return unto
[41:12] me void but it shall accomplish that
[41:14] which I please amen and it shall prosper
[41:17] in the thing where to ascend it amen hey
[41:21] it shall even prosperity
[41:28] is the word prospering in you now
[41:30] YouTube yeah
[41:37] or is the word suffering
[41:43] but the Lord says
[41:46] if it is sent to the right place
[41:52] what shall happen
[41:54] it shall prosperity
[41:58] have we ever seen the wait prospering in
[42:01] somebody
[42:07] amen amen that somebody is always full
[42:10] of love
[42:12] always singing
[42:17] I mean take your brain away
[42:21] amen amen the prosperity of the weight
[42:24] is
[42:41] be it during the what do you call
[42:44] lockdown
[42:48] s
[42:54] [Music]
[42:56] I want to see the prosperity
[43:07] if you are a place
[43:10] and the way it has found its place
[43:17] oh
[43:18] because it is not from them
[43:29] words from the pulpit can mislead and
[43:32] yeah
[43:37] can even kill this Prosperity
[43:42] that's why today
[43:47] our preaching
[43:48] is for the prosperity of the way
[43:55] a lot of money
[44:00] okay
[44:02] now usually do you allow me to reach
[44:10] I'm trying to visit this other woman
[44:12] here
[44:15] you call here
[44:18] sister h
[44:21] I don't know
[44:23] if we can find another 80
[44:28] Among Us

[44:36] among all the people there
[44:40] were men young men too
[44:49] okay
[45:00] [Music]

[1:11:23] now I've got two books here yeah
[1:11:27] Moses he says let these people know
[1:11:31] foreign
[1:11:41] I know
[1:11:43] people are going from this people to
[1:11:46] that part right
[1:11:50] but the weight is not from the pulpit
[1:11:54] the word should come from God
[1:12:04] everybody can read their spoken right
[1:12:08] and stand up and say I am
[1:12:12] recite the things
[1:12:15] foreign
[1:12:54] where there was no
[1:12:56] [Music]
[1:12:57] um
[1:13:00] my book let me find you
[1:13:04] then it says here sister sister
[1:13:08] are nothing but the truth
[1:13:16] some who were there
[1:13:19] were thinking about it
[1:13:24] we have never seen squirrels around here
[1:13:30] but sister sister said brother
[1:13:34] nothing but the truth
[1:13:38] now John did you hear what the prophet
[1:13:41] said
[1:13:43] if I can find this book
[1:13:47] what he has said
[1:13:50] to him I am much said okay let me cook
[1:13:55] it
[1:13:58] foreign
[1:14:32] did not say it from here
[1:14:38] if
[1:14:39] if it's not from here then he says God
[1:14:43] spoke
[1:14:45] out of him
[1:14:51] Peter Pedro the Lord Jesus said what do
[1:14:56] men say I the son of man amen
[1:15:01] they say some say married
[1:15:09] and they turned to the classes
[1:15:14] because there's always a class
[1:15:17] among the people there's a prophetic
[1:15:20] classroom
[1:15:25] now we turn to the prophetic classes
[1:15:32] if the people say I'm this is
[1:15:42] okay
[1:15:45] I the son of man
[1:15:47] and Peter said
[1:15:49] Thou Art the Christ oh Christ
[1:15:55] he didn't say thou art Jesus
[1:16:04] because Jesus
[1:16:11] he was called Jesus
[1:16:14] but Peter said
[1:16:19] I'm in
[1:16:20] that's why you look at the predestinated
[1:16:22] seats
[1:16:28] is the mystery of God
[1:16:33] it can't say Jesus Christ
[1:16:41] [Applause]
[1:16:47] foreign
[1:17:12] way now
[1:17:14] that is three four okay
[1:17:16] you are part of that freeform
[1:17:20] that's why when the seventh is revealed
[1:17:24] it is
[1:17:31] it is like a lightning
[1:17:37] they're all three foods
[1:17:40] what is three foreign
[1:18:16] let's go back to you
[1:18:18] the beginning
[1:18:21] is God
[1:18:23] logos logos amen
[1:18:32] that is amen
[1:18:36] and Jesus
[1:18:38] reminded them
[1:18:44] you shall know
[1:18:49] I know
[1:18:52] I know that I'm part of the three four
[1:18:55] yeah
[1:19:05] the seventh sillies
[1:19:10] [Music]
[1:19:13] that I am in the father
[1:19:25] you are holding the third position
[1:19:30] [Applause]
[1:19:31] so the whole thing is
[1:19:43] open in the it is
[1:19:53] thank you
[1:19:54] so part of the three four
[1:19:57] it is open in me as part of the
[1:20:01] threefolds
[1:20:05] all right
[1:20:07] yeah yeah
[1:20:09] you know I was reading even something
[1:20:12] and it didn't puzzle me
[1:20:16] but let me read it to you
[1:20:19] the same thing you're not about you you
[1:20:22] know this message is not just a letter
[1:20:29] yeah this is something here
[1:20:34] and
[1:20:36] and the son of man that is proving his
[1:20:40] words
[1:20:42] and the son of man is revealing himself
[1:20:47] in the same power
[1:20:51] that he was
[1:20:54] not down through the churches
[1:20:58] through justification
[1:21:03] but the son of man
[1:21:06] then he says who is the son of man
[1:21:13] you know we are so blessed three sure
[1:21:18] even to know who who you can preach we
[1:21:22] are the son of name
[1:21:29] right amen
[1:21:31] who is the son of man
[1:21:34] the word
[1:21:42] right while I see you have a dizzy a bit
[1:21:48] let me look into this let's say
[1:21:53] who is the son of man
[1:21:57] it comes in stages
[1:22:03] he was the son of man when he was here
[1:22:06] called the son of man
[1:22:10] Prophet prophet
[1:22:12] but proving his words
[1:22:21] the son of man
[1:22:24] who is the son of man now
[1:22:30] now you are going to say oh Lord
[1:22:33] to go back and say it's Jesus teaches
[1:22:37] the prophet the son of man
[1:22:39] here now
[1:22:43] you know that
[1:22:44] the book says
[1:22:49] the message of the Seven Seals
[1:22:54] in their closing
[1:22:58] that's the message of the entire Bible
[1:23:01] the seven series
[1:23:11] I mean
[1:23:12] [Applause]
[1:23:13] now what will happen to you if the New
[1:23:16] Testament is
[1:23:22] because the servants
[1:23:25] is beyond all this testimonies
[1:23:34] let
[1:23:35] us let us read this
[1:23:38] you know I can read the books prophecies
[1:23:45] but Philip
[1:23:48] but failing to bring about the
[1:23:51] manifestation
[1:23:53] the prophet said
[1:24:00] amen amen
[1:24:05] it is like applying the word
[1:24:12] if you believe
[1:24:15] you are healed
[1:24:20] that's why somebody who believes can
[1:24:25] just touch you
[1:24:28] and
[1:24:31] but this touch
[1:24:33] has to find something in you a Chinese
[1:24:42] so if this that faith in you
[1:24:46] like that woman
[1:24:49] she came from Beyond
[1:24:53] foreign
[1:25:32] is that so
[1:25:35] no she didn't only say that
[1:25:38] she started me with the atoma
[1:25:42] towards the hand and Thomas
[1:25:46] you could see him
[1:25:48] pushing the people because there was a
[1:25:52] pool
[1:25:53] she has already said it
[1:25:56] look it's pulling yeah
[1:26:07] you look at Moses
[1:26:09] with a stick at swearing partner he
[1:26:13] conquered Egypt
[1:26:15] amen
[1:26:17] he never thought of a big army to attack
[1:26:19] ages
[1:26:25] and
[1:26:30] he made him God
[1:26:34] for God to make you God
[1:26:38] that's when he has that trusting
[1:26:43] [Applause]
[1:26:45] when God believes in you he makes you a
[1:26:48] god
[1:26:55] amen amen and the Bible says he came
[1:27:00] from behind
[1:27:03] foreign
[1:27:16] all right amen
[1:27:19] as I went to preach that sister sorry I
[1:27:23] went to preach to pray for that City
[1:27:27] when I started take it home it was
[1:27:30] already done
[1:27:31] the only thing was to touch him
[1:27:39] but it is already done
[1:27:42] I don't know whether you understand
[1:27:45] [Applause]
[1:27:48] right now this is puzzling
[1:27:55] the son of man
[1:28:02] they wait
[1:28:07] the son of man who is the son of man
[1:28:13] who's going to believe it amen
[1:28:19] okay
[1:28:20] now he comes whether you Christa
[1:28:32] he changes
[1:28:34] from being jealous
[1:28:39] amen amen next time he is Jesus the
[1:28:42] Christ
[1:28:47] taking forms amen
[1:28:54] but the principal fella
[1:28:58] is the way
[1:29:02] taking some forms
[1:29:05] and then let's say it says
[1:29:08] the son of man
[1:29:10] is the way
[1:29:12] let
[1:29:14] me see if if I can find this foreign
[1:29:22] the son of man now
[1:29:29] when she believed
[1:29:33] what the prophet same propheter
[1:29:38] said to her I said
[1:29:43] she said we are nothing so but
[1:29:48] the truth
[1:29:50] now you see different people yes
[1:29:55] he says or
[1:29:57] and
[1:29:59] she was she said this
[1:30:03] not from here
[1:30:08] because from here
[1:30:11] you will if you are from here you will
[1:30:15] see I have never seen a squirrel
[1:30:23] well somebody's listening
[1:30:26] remote
[1:30:56] it says
[1:30:58] she was
[1:31:00] out
[1:31:02] no not she she
[1:31:04] say it
[1:31:06] she was off amen of the things
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:14] amen
[1:31:16] now she has hid the word
[1:31:19] not from here
[1:31:24] all the things
[1:31:28] now when brother Brenham spoke
[1:31:31] he spoke to her not from here
[1:31:37] the way it was not from here
[1:31:41] that's why she said nothing but the
[1:31:46] truth
[1:31:48] somebody could have said um
[1:31:51] what truth have you ever seen a squirrel
[1:31:56] when you say it's the truth is the truth
[1:32:04] he's left
[1:32:06] all right
[1:32:08] and then he said
[1:32:11] she did not say it
[1:32:14] from here
[1:32:17] then
[1:32:19] here is another thing the next thing
[1:32:22] what did he say
[1:32:28] she didn't say it
[1:32:30] from from here God spoke from a heart
[1:32:33] amen because from here you can't believe
[1:32:36] this is
[1:32:46] from where it is coming from

[1:32:56] now coming from the creation
[1:33:04] you see the difference all things are
[1:33:08] possible
