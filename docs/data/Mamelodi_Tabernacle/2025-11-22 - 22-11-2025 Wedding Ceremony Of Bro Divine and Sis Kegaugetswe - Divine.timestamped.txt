[7:46] Good morning ladies and gentlemen.
[7:52] Good morning everyone.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:01] Program director. Thank you for the
[8:04] opportunity
[8:05] given to me to welcome
[8:08] this esteemed and dignified guest.
[8:15] It's my pleasure, ladies and gentlemen,
[8:18] to stand before you today
[8:22] to welcome you to this very special
[8:25] event.
[8:28] Today we have gathered here
[8:32] in this beautiful hall
[8:36] to celebrate together
[8:39] this special day.
[8:43] On behalf of the Sakala family
[8:48] and the Mquille family,
[8:52] I hereby welcome you to the wedding
[8:55] celebration
[8:57] of their son and daughter.
[9:03] This is the wedding celebration of
[9:06] divine
[9:08] Sakala
[9:10] and
[9:12] Mole
[9:17] Divine Sakala is the first sponsson of
[9:22] dim sakala
[9:25] and mezeni
[9:27] sakala
[9:30] and
[9:34] is the secondborn daughter
[9:37] of Reel Mule.
[9:42] and meo.
[9:47] I'm not sure whether
[9:51] Amen.
[9:58] You know, it gives me pleasure, ladies
[10:01] and gentlemen,
[10:04] to remind this house that the scriptures
[10:08] declares that marriage
[10:11] is instituted by God.
[10:16] God ordained marriage.
[10:19] This is God's work.
[10:22] It is not a man's creation. It's not a
[10:25] man's work. It's God's work.
[10:29] The world may try to imitate
[10:34] God claiming that marriage belongs to
[10:37] the world. I will say no, it doesn't
[10:40] belong to this world. It is God's
[10:43] creation.
[10:45] That will remain a fallacy. Hence, there
[10:49] is no truth in that and it is
[10:52] misleading.
[10:55] Amen.
[10:59] I stand here without shame, ladies and
[11:03] gentlemen,
[11:05] appreciating the role the church played
[11:09] in preparing for this wedding
[11:11] celebration.
[11:14] Working hand in love with the two
[11:17] families,
[11:18] the Sakalas and the Mulles.
[11:22] This confirms
[11:24] that what I said is true.
[11:29] This confirms that the church recognizes
[11:34] the fact that marriage is God's
[11:37] institution.
[11:39] It's God's creation.
[11:42] I want to pause and salute
[11:46] the Mamelo Tabernacle Church.
[11:50] salute the priest of the Maloi
[11:53] Tabernacle Church
[11:56] and also salute the deacons and the
[12:00] church elders
[12:03] and I also salute the entire
[12:06] congregation of
[12:09] the Mamelo Tabernacle Church.
[12:15] Shalom saints.
[12:20] The Sakala and the Moule family highly
[12:23] appreciate the role you are playing in
[12:27] nation building.
[12:30] Ladies and gentlemen, feel heartily
[12:34] welcomed in this wedding celebration.

[12:44] work of God.

[40:50] Hallelujah.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Now we are coming to a very crucial
[40:55] time.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; The time of officiation.
[41:03] So amongst us.
[41:06] We've got the pastor that I want to
[41:08] introduce.
[41:12] the pastor who is the son to our pastor
[41:16] Israel.
[41:21] Whenever
[41:24] Amen.
[41:27] Whenever the pastor summons him
[41:31] to stand in the gap,
[41:34] he's always there.
[41:37] Hallelujah.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So today he's here
[41:42] and he's still going to stand in the gap
[41:45] even when our pastor is in glory.
[41:50] Hallelujah.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; I just want to welcome
[41:56] our precious pastor
[42:01] to come
[42:03] &gt;&gt; and take his pullpit
[42:05] &gt;&gt; as we sing our song.
[42:09] He will come. God bless you.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Let's stand on our feet. Amen. As we
[42:16] welcoming the word of God.
[42:18] But in the days
[42:21] of the voice
[42:23] of the seven
[42:29] when he
[42:34] begin
[42:37] to
[42:39] the
[42:45] God
[42:47] should Finished
[42:49] as he
[42:52] has declared
[42:54] to the seven
[43:05] Elijah
[43:08] prophets
[43:10] before
[43:12] the great
[43:15] and
[43:17] fulfill
[43:30] the children.
[43:32] The hearts
[43:34] of the children
[43:37] to the
[43:40] bless
[43:42] I go. Yes, I
[43:56] welcome
[44:05] Holy Ghost
[44:12] You will
[44:16] with power
[44:19] with power.
[44:38] Thank you.
[44:43] I greet you all in this hall in the
[44:46] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[44:48] Jesus Christ.
[44:55] Amen. As I was mandated by pastor
[45:04] that I must help in this type of
[45:09] situation.
[45:13] But after his passing away,
[45:20] &gt;&gt; the board of mood
[45:24] renewed that
[45:27] Monday
[45:33] they said, "Pastor Makua,
[45:40] You must go on helping us.
[45:45] I'm standing here today
[45:49] in a new mandate
[45:54] mandated by the board
[45:58] &gt;&gt; of Modi
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Assembly.
[46:06] um I wouldn't have just come
[46:11] saying that the pastor said
[46:15] but I had to listen to the board
[46:21] and when the board said
[46:24] now we still mandate
[46:29] then I'm standing here with a mandate
[46:34] I'm not get crashing.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; I was mandated.
[46:42] God bless
[46:48] this mandate.
[46:50] They said until they have a new pastor.
[46:58] In other words, you will see me here.
[47:03] That is a mandate.
[47:07] Whilst standing on our feet,
[47:10] let's open the book of Joshua.
[47:15] We see brother Brenam in cases like this
[47:18] one.
[47:21] He didn't used to preach.
[47:25] He was just officiating.
[47:28] But I don't know where did we get this
[47:30] preaching.
[47:35] But let me just do something also
[47:40] as
[47:45] we read the book of Joshua
[47:48] chapter 3.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Can you read it from verse 1 to 4?
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Verse one.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Joshua chapter 3 from verse 1 to 4. And
[48:00] Joshua rose early in the morning, and
[48:02] they removed from Shetim, and came to
[48:05] Jordan, he and all the children of
[48:07] Israel, and lodged there before they
[48:11] passed over. And it came to pass after 3
[48:14] days that the officers went through the
[48:17] host. And they commanded the people,
[48:19] saying, "When ye see the ark of the
[48:22] covenant of the Lord your God, and the
[48:25] priests of the Levites bearing it, then
[48:28] ye shall remove from your place, and go
[48:31] after it. Yet there shall be a space
[48:34] between you and it, about 2,000 cubits
[48:38] by measure. Come not near unto it that
[48:41] ye may know the way by which he must go
[48:45] for ye have not passed this way before.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Let's close our eyes.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Father,
[48:54] here I am.
[48:56] Here is the church.
[48:59] Here are the two people
[49:02] who are to be joined together. Here is
[49:06] the scripture. Fred,
[49:09] I am asking that you take these words
[49:11] here,
[49:13] place them in each and everyone's hearts
[49:16] here so that when they get out of this
[49:19] hall,
[49:21] they might have something to meditate
[49:23] on. I pray heavenly father in the name
[49:27] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. You may
[49:30] take your seats.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; As you know,
[49:37] &gt;&gt; today is the day of dive and
[49:49] they must enjoy this day.
[49:52] I mustn't take their time.
[49:56] I must just join them.
[49:59] Because marriage
[50:02] comes from God
[50:04] and it must be God to sanction it.
[50:10] And where is God?
[50:13] God said
[50:15] as my father has sent me
[50:19] so I send you
[50:22] as I'm standing here. I'm sent by him.
[50:26] Yeah,
[50:27] &gt;&gt; if I'm sent by him,
[50:30] it means he has seen me
[50:33] and if you stand in front of me,
[50:37] you are standing in front of him.
[50:41] And now here, I've got just a little
[50:44] topic.
[50:47] That topic is
[50:50] &gt;&gt; is the new road.
[50:55] The road I'm going to usher the two in,
[51:02] it will be the new road to them.
[51:07] They have never went through this road
[51:09] before.
[51:13] They're going to start
[51:16] to walk in this road.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; They don't know it.
[51:22] That's why Joshua here said,
[51:25] &gt;&gt; he said, "Come
[51:27] and follow the ark
[51:30] because we are we are to enter the new
[51:33] land."
[51:36] But you must follow the ark
[51:41] because you have not went through this
[51:43] before.
[51:46] And I think these two
[51:49] they have not went this before.
[51:52] It's the road of marriage.
[51:56] They have not went through.
[51:59] When God was creating the earth,
[52:03] he made mountains,
[52:07] &gt;&gt; hills
[52:09] and rivers
[52:11] and the valleys
[52:15] &gt;&gt; and the plains.
[52:18] He was showing
[52:20] that in the life we're going to walk
[52:22] through
[52:25] because life
[52:28] is a journey he was showing us.
[52:32] But in this journey of life
[52:36] it we will have mountains to climb.
[52:42] They will have valleys to go through.
[52:47] There will be plains to go through
[52:51] even in the in this route of marriage.
[52:56] There will be mountains to go through.
[53:00] There will be valleys to go through.
[53:04] There will be plain to go through.
[53:08] Don't don't expect
[53:11] that you'll go only through the plane.
[53:16] You will have to climb the mountain.
[53:20] You will have to go deep to the valley.
[53:25] When Israel was fighting with the the
[53:27] Assyrians,
[53:30] &gt;&gt; the Assyrians for Israel on the
[53:32] mountains.
[53:35] Israel defeated them
[53:38] and they thought, "The God of Israel
[53:43] &gt;&gt; is the God of the mountain.
[53:46] They said let's meet them on the valley
[53:50] so that we can defeat them because their
[53:53] god is the god of the mountain and they
[53:57] were defeated also
[53:59] in the valley. Well, I want to tell the
[54:02] two
[54:04] when they go through the mountain,
[54:07] when they go through the valley,
[54:09] they must know
[54:12] the word of the mountain.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; The word of the is still the word of the
[54:16] valley.
[54:19] The word of the plain is still the word
[54:22] of the mountain
[54:25] is the word of the valley.
[54:28] He is always there.
[54:30] But what they must do,
[54:33] they must not forget
[54:35] to follow the ark
[54:41] in marriage.
[54:46] Some will try.
[54:48] You must be careful
[54:51] who you allow to walk with you in this
[54:54] road
[54:58] to walk with you.
[55:01] with you both.
[55:06] You must be careful
[55:08] because some will help you to end soon.
[55:18] They will lead you to the
[55:21] to chaos.
[55:26] You must trust everybody.
[55:30] In this road of death, what you must do?
[55:35] Follow the ark.
[55:37] When there is problems,
[55:39] follow the ark. When there is happiness,
[55:43] follow the ark.
[55:48] There will be trials.
[55:51] There will be tribulations
[55:55] in this road. But you must know what you
[56:00] must know that God's hand
[56:04] is always leading you
[56:08] because you are following the ark.
[56:12] When you follow the ark, you must know
[56:14] the order of the ark
[56:19] because the ark has got its own order.
[56:24] That's why Joshua said, "You must not
[56:27] interfere
[56:30] with the order of the earth."
[56:33] Follow the order
[56:36] &gt;&gt; of the earth. There was a man who failed
[56:39] to follow the order of the earth.
[56:45] And he caused the death of two innoc of
[56:48] a one innocent person.
[56:54] because he didn't follow
[56:58] the order of the ark.
[57:00] He wanted to bring the ark
[57:03] that which is a good thing
[57:06] but he had to
[57:09] follow the order
[57:13] of the ark.
[57:15] This act Paul said follow me as I follow
[57:21] Christ.
[57:24] It means Paul was the ark of his time.
[57:30] If you are following Paul, you were
[57:33] following the ark
[57:35] because in the ark there there was God
[57:39] there. He said follow me because I am
[57:44] following Christ.
[57:46] What does he mean? He means when you
[57:49] follow him,
[57:51] you are following Christ.
[57:53] In other words, you cannot follow Christ
[57:57] following Paul.
[58:00] It was the order
[58:02] of the ar
[58:09] you couldn't stand and say I'm following
[58:12] God. I'm following Christ but not
[58:15] following Paul.
[58:18] You will be out
[58:21] out of the order of the ark.
[58:26] We are still having the ark.
[58:28] Hallelujah.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; And that act has got its order.
[58:37] You must follow the order.
[58:41] If you follow the order of the ark,
[58:45] I promise you your journey in the
[58:49] marriage,
[58:51] it will be a successful journey.
[58:54] But if you don't follow the order,
[58:58] you want to interfere with the ark.
[59:05] You want to help from the ark.
[59:08] You want to help from the ark,
[59:12] but you interfere
[59:15] with the ark. Follow the order.
[59:20] And when you follow the order of the
[59:22] ark,
[59:24] Then we get the good results.
[59:27] Not like David.
[59:30] David find bad results
[59:33] because he failed
[59:36] to to to follow the order of the earth
[59:42] in this book
[59:44] tell my disciple.
[59:47] He said people will say
[59:51] how am I going to do this?
[59:55] or do that.
[59:57] Go out will take care of the rest of it.
[1:00:06] Don't ponder
[1:00:09] what I'm going to do in this vein of
[1:00:13] marriage.
[1:00:15] God will take care of the rest
[1:00:19] if you follow the act.
[1:00:24] Don't lose focus
[1:00:28] of the ark.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Follow it
[1:00:35] in this journey.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; The in this road
[1:00:41] of marriage
[1:00:43] is not about perfection.
[1:00:47] Everything that is started by God
[1:00:52] Satan will fight it
[1:00:57] with with whatever he has
[1:01:01] because marriage is started by God.
[1:01:05] Satan will try to fight it
[1:01:09] and he is fighting it even now.
[1:01:14] You are witnesses here.
[1:01:16] Satan is fighting
[1:01:19] is fighting in the marriage
[1:01:22] because it is started by God.
[1:01:27] Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Mistakes will happen.
[1:01:31] Sometimes ways will hurt
[1:01:36] and it is part of being a human being.
[1:01:43] Real couples
[1:01:47] couples. Couples,
[1:01:52] we learn to apologize to one another
[1:01:58] because that heals faster.
[1:02:02] It heals.
[1:02:05] It heals faster
[1:02:08] than silence.
[1:02:11] Amen.
[1:02:15] If there is mistakes,
[1:02:18] it helps
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; to forgive one another to ask to ask for
[1:02:23] forgiveness
[1:02:26] to to apologize
[1:02:30] to one another
[1:02:33] because that heals
[1:02:37] faster
[1:02:40] than silence. Yes.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Real couples,
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; the couples
[1:02:51] in this route of marriage,
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; they will stay,
[1:02:59] talking together,
[1:03:01] forgiving one another,
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; learning about one another,
[1:03:06] learning about one another,
[1:03:11] You must learn about your wife
[1:03:15] and your wife must learn about you.
[1:03:18] He must know
[1:03:20] what he must know. The the wife, she
[1:03:23] must know
[1:03:25] what you want.
[1:03:27] What you don't want.
[1:03:30] You must also know what she wants. What
[1:03:34] she don't want.
[1:03:36] Amen. That is the way life goes on in
[1:03:40] this room.
[1:03:47] You must you must learn
[1:03:54] forgiving one another.
[1:03:58] You must learn.
[1:04:00] When you you you forgive one another,
[1:04:05] you will you will grow together.
[1:04:09] Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; But if if you you hold some grudges
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; or files,
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; you will never grow
[1:04:28] in this journey of marriage.
[1:04:31] We don't hold files.
[1:04:36] We talk together.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; We bring the files.
[1:04:40] We open them.
[1:04:43] See what is in the file
[1:04:47] and throw them in the dust pin.
[1:04:53] Real couples in this route of marriage.
[1:04:57] They must know that this road has ups
[1:04:59] and downs.
[1:05:04] Staying together.
[1:05:07] It will make them stronger.
[1:05:15] You must not shun from one another.
[1:05:22] If you shan from one another in the
[1:05:24] bedroom,
[1:05:28] you are causing a problem
[1:05:31] because God said
[1:05:34] you must not shine from one another
[1:05:38] in the bedroom
[1:05:41] and that will cause
[1:05:44] someone to get in
[1:05:52] Are you together with me?
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Because I'm I'm talking to you.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Some are just trying to
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Some are trying to to to take what is
[1:06:08] not theirs.
[1:06:11] It is yours
[1:06:14] because the road you have not walked in
[1:06:18] before.
[1:06:20] I have walked through this room.
[1:06:23] I'm telling you.
[1:06:25] I'm telling you what is happening
[1:06:29] in this room.
[1:06:32] I am not telling you a fiction.
[1:06:37] I'm telling you what is happening.
[1:06:41] in this room.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; The young man
[1:06:50] with an uncircumcised
[1:06:53] heart
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; must not marry.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Let me repeat.
[1:07:04] A young man with an uncircumcised
[1:07:09] heart,
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; he must not marry.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; You see in my tradition.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; If you are an ancircumcised person,
[1:07:27] you are not allowed to marry.
[1:07:32] than a person with his with an
[1:07:35] uncircumcised heart.
[1:07:38] That's why Jesus said when they were
[1:07:41] telling him about divorces,
[1:07:44] he said is because of your uncircumcised
[1:07:48] heart
[1:07:53] which causes
[1:07:59] because
[1:08:03] He
[1:08:05] he will never he he should be the head
[1:08:08] of the family.
[1:08:14] He should be the leader of the family.
[1:08:21] How can he be the head of the family
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; if he is headless?
[1:08:31] Because his head must be crushed.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; If then he if he is uncircumcised
[1:08:44] because Christ dwells in a circumcised
[1:08:46] heart.
[1:08:50] If the heart is not circumcised,
[1:08:53] it means Christ is not there.
[1:08:56] If Christ is not there,
[1:08:59] then you are hateless.
[1:09:02] How can you be the head
[1:09:06] when you are hateless?
[1:09:11] Amen.
[1:09:13] The proverb says,
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; who can find a virtuous woman
[1:09:24] for her price?
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; For her price is more is above rubies.
[1:09:37] Who can find such people?
[1:09:40] It means it is scarce
[1:09:46] woman.
[1:09:50] You cannot find
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; I believe my brother you have found a
[1:09:56] visual
[1:09:59] I it's my belief
[1:10:02] because he scares to be found.
[1:10:07] He says but prophet says
[1:10:11] Solomon says
[1:10:14] riches
[1:10:16] belongs to the father
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; but the prudent woman
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; is a gift from God.
[1:10:26] If you find a prudent woman,
[1:10:30] yeah, that is a wise woman. Prudent
[1:10:33] woman is a wise woman
[1:10:35] who can differentiate.
[1:10:39] He can see this is not good.
[1:10:43] It's not good for my husband.
[1:10:46] This is good for my husband. Is a
[1:10:48] prudent woman.
[1:10:51] The Bible says is a gift from God.
[1:10:56] Amen.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; He said if you find a woman,
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; you must know
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; that you are given by God.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet says
[1:11:11] the most important thing
[1:11:15] besides salvation
[1:11:18] is a good woman.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; If God can give you
[1:11:26] something better
[1:11:31] above besides salvation
[1:11:34] is a good
[1:11:37] in other words you can't just find a
[1:11:39] woman
[1:11:42] you can't just find a wife
[1:11:46] beside God giving you
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; you too
[1:11:55] You too,
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; you too
[1:11:59] stand out.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; But you must know,
[1:12:04] you must follow the art
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; in this journey.
[1:12:10] You must not lose focus.
[1:12:15] I said you must know who you allow.
[1:12:19] You must know. You must know who you
[1:12:20] allow
[1:12:24] to get with to walk with you in this
[1:12:27] chain
[1:12:29] because he may misdirect you.
[1:12:33] Leave this ark.
[1:12:37] Don't follow the order of the ark.
[1:12:44] Just go this way.
[1:12:47] Don't lose focus.
[1:12:49] If you don't lose focus,
[1:12:52] your journey
[1:12:54] will end smoothly.
[1:12:59] God
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; is taking control.
[1:13:06] We know
[1:13:09] our God
[1:13:11] is the one who initiated these things.
[1:13:18] He has taken a woman
[1:13:21] out of a man. He didn't took another
[1:13:24] dust,
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; but out of the man,
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; he took a woman.
[1:13:32] When marriage
[1:13:34] is a restoration,
[1:13:36] in other words, you go back to where you
[1:13:39] belong. Amen.
[1:13:46] is she is going back
[1:13:49] where she belonged
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; because in the beginning when God
[1:13:58] created man
[1:14:00] he created male and female
[1:14:05] that's why when Adam was a man there
[1:14:10] God said it was not Good.
[1:14:14] They must be two
[1:14:17] male and female.
[1:14:19] If a man is not married
[1:14:22] is not complete,
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; is incomplete.
[1:14:32] Those who have come with you,
[1:14:36] they must stand together with you.
[1:14:42] Oh,
[1:14:44] amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; I studied this way.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; You You come
[1:14:59] together.

[1:15:28] you.
[1:15:30] Let me study that side.

[1:15:36] When I ask
[1:15:39] you tell me your name
[1:15:43] and then the the relationship
[1:15:48] with the brother.
[1:15:52] Who will I ask
[1:15:55] to give this man
[1:16:00] to this woman?
[1:16:04] My name is Dim
[1:16:07] Sakala.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; I am the father of Zal Sakala.
[1:16:14] He is my first born
[1:16:17] and I'm very happy that today finally

[1:18:21] your seats.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; I want to remain with only the two.
[1:18:35] Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in
[1:18:37] the sight of God,
[1:18:41] the face of this company
[1:18:45] to join the two together.
[1:18:48] This man and this woman
[1:18:51] in a holy matrimony
[1:18:54] which is commanded by St. power
[1:18:58] to be honorable among all men.
[1:19:02] It is therefore
[1:19:05] not by any means
[1:19:08] to be entered into unadvisably
[1:19:14] rightly.
[1:19:18] But it must be entered advisory.
[1:19:26] in the fear of God
[1:19:30] in this holy state.
[1:19:34] These two persons present
[1:19:38] come to be joy.
[1:19:40] If there is any reason, if there is any
[1:19:43] person
[1:19:44] that can show a just cause
[1:19:48] why they should not be lawfully joined
[1:19:51] together
[1:19:54] in this holy matrimony,
[1:19:57] do you now speak
[1:19:59] or from hereafter
[1:20:03] forever hold your peace.
[1:20:11] There is none.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; I will require and I will charge you
[1:20:16] both
[1:20:19] as you will surely answer at the day of
[1:20:22] judgment.
[1:20:25] When the secrets of all hearts
[1:20:28] shall be disclosed,
[1:20:31] that that either of you
[1:20:35] No any impediment.
[1:20:39] Why you should not be lawfully joined
[1:20:41] together
[1:20:46] in this matrimony?
[1:20:48] Do you now confess it?
[1:20:52] will be it assured unto you
[1:20:56] that any couple that are joined
[1:20:58] otherwise
[1:21:02] than go
[1:21:06] their marriage is not lawful
[1:21:10] but surely believing that you have
[1:21:12] considered this solemn obligation
[1:21:18] that you are about to assume
[1:21:21] and that you have prepared to enter upon
[1:21:27] reverently
[1:21:29] gratefully
[1:21:32] in the fear of God. I shall propose to
[1:21:35] you
[1:21:37] the marriage covenant.
[1:21:40] You will declare the same
[1:21:42] when you join your right hands together.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; I'm studying with you divine.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; I I was talking to a young man. I was
[1:22:02] talking another man.
[1:22:05] I said to him,
[1:22:08] you have you have you have broken your
[1:22:11] marriage vow
[1:22:15] because you said you will take this
[1:22:18] woman
[1:22:21] as your only woman,
[1:22:26] not with another woman.
[1:22:30] But now you have taken another.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Now you have taken another one.
[1:22:36] You have broken that part. I said it
