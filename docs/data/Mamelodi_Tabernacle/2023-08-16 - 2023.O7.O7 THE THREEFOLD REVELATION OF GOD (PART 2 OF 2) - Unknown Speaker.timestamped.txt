[0:03] I've seen it happening in the church
[0:06] there sorry if you have a question
[0:10] then you'll come to the service
[0:16] you realize the pastor will answer that
[0:19] okay
[0:26] um
[0:27] I've seen it happening many a time I've
[0:31] seen it happening
[0:34] assistant brother would come to me
[0:40] Pastor I had a problem with this and
[0:43] this and this pastor episode
[0:46] now when you're preaching this morning
[0:50] I have received the answer
[0:56] then I said I say
[0:58] brother Brendan says
[1:03] the other part of the
[1:07] trans God contracts contract yeah
[1:18] that's that's why we have pastors here
[1:21] yeah
[1:23] part of the contract is
[1:29] then if he loses the contract
[1:35] the whole church will lose the contract
[1:38] [Music]
[1:40] because as a pastor
[1:44] Joseph
[1:46] you are a Shepherd contracted
[1:52] you are receiving from God yes
[2:03] you respect your pastor
[2:11] here
[2:14] I will encourage you to respect your
[2:17] pasta
[2:22] because he is the shepherd here
[2:29] foreign
[2:45] okay
[2:47] let us read why the people say the
[2:51] seventh is not revealed
[2:57] and ask when will it be revered because
[3:03] the days are coming are going
[3:07] um
[3:23] and uh
[3:24] is the rapture coming to find us still
[3:27] waiting for their servants to be
[3:29] revealed is
[3:42] look at it why
[3:48] [Applause]
[3:50] all right Hallelujah
[3:54] I asked a brother when is it going to be
[3:58] revealed
[4:03] because
[4:05] since I received the message
[4:08] Nini
[4:32] until today they are quiet about it
[4:41] now I read out here
[4:43] Tanga
[4:46] says
[4:48] now I want you to notice
[4:52] tonight
[4:54] in The Sixth Seal
[4:57] Kachina bilimbo there was a three
[5:01] peoples
[5:06] in the sixth sale Katina six
[5:12] so
[5:15] page five seven three
[5:19] foreign
[5:22] [Music]
[5:44] it is also a threefold mystery
[5:53] now if you say that the servant is not
[5:56] revealed that means you have reduced
[5:59] reduced it to a twofold
[6:02] is
[6:11] now you'll remain with two forms
[6:15] which the number of life is
[6:20] the number of life
[6:22] foreign
[6:31] that's when we are still looking for
[6:34] life
[6:56] amen and the Perfection
[7:02] two is not the number of perfection
[7:07] that's why it says
[7:09] it is revealed in a free food
[7:16] and we were looking at the threefolds
[7:21] that in the book of uh uh uh Genesis
[7:30] puts it as God
[7:34] and
[7:36] logos and the men and the men yeah
[7:48] Moto okay okay that's why he says you
[7:53] know when he came to the Jews
[7:58] he said to them I and my father are one
[8:05] he never mentioned the third
[8:10] at that time I and my father
[8:15] but when the gentle Church
[8:19] comes in because
[8:32] amen because three is the number of
[8:35] Perfections
[8:41] amen amen
[8:46] the Third
[8:50] without the third because
[8:56] the third is a complete now listen to
[8:58] this year
[9:02] do you notice
[9:05] do you
[9:06] noticeable yeah
[9:08] on the opening of the seventh seal
[9:12] natango is
[9:15] also in a three-fold mystery
[9:26] amen
[9:28] it can be in there too
[9:30] and it is not opened
[9:34] now he says
[9:37] on the opening of the seventh seal
[9:40] it's also in a three-fold
[9:50] now the threefold
[9:54] if I go back to Genesis
[9:58] it is a a threefold in this manner
[10:05] God
[10:07] the logos
[10:11] that's how he puts it
[10:16] but men got lost
[10:19] and when he came to Israel
[10:22] Israel he spoke of the twofold of it
[10:26] yeah
[10:27] because men being the partner of the
[10:30] contract was out
[10:36] but after the Pentecostal blessing
[10:39] because
[10:41] then they went back to Father Son and
[10:44] Holy Ghost
[10:49] they started to count three again
[10:54] but before that he said to the Jews
[10:59] I and my father
[11:05] Tata
[11:26] is
[11:29] now let me read something here
[11:38] let brother Brennan put it to us
[11:45] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[11:48] Crystal Christian
[11:50] I've got this book here
[11:57] looking let's start with the church
[12:00] let's start with the changes
[12:07] he Reveals His change
[12:14] because the church is a revealed the
[12:18] bride is the revealed Church where the
[12:21] Mercedes
[12:24] the money Sami is not just a church
[12:29] and raising it up by the same weight
[12:36] it is part of his threefold is
[12:45] do we believe that escape episode
[12:49] and
[13:07] logos logos
[13:09] then the man
[13:58] the bride is not made of the readers
[14:02] foreign
[14:25] sorry the battle that was fought you
[14:28] know we have the battle of Armageddon
[14:36] I mean
[14:39] Beyond time
[14:41] he says it was fought Beyond time
[14:45] and it will be finished Beyond Time
[14:53] that's right okay and with the seals
[14:56] also
[15:01] were there Beyond time
[15:05] they were revealed Beyond Time
[15:10] their time had not yet
[15:12] arrived
[15:15] because the third one was not yet there
[15:19] the third one yes
[15:28] God is completed he is perfect in three
[15:32] zombies
[15:35] but you are part of the third pool of
[15:39] the threefold
[15:44] now I will I will close by saying this
[15:52] uh remember
[15:53] [Music]
[15:55] he opened the seals
[15:58] and stopped at their seats
[16:03] and that's why they say it is not
[16:05] revealed
[16:08] when he was coming in his
[16:12] um uh creation
[16:18] somewhere and stopped uh
[16:22] and the man who resembled him
[16:30] after he created
[16:37] every time he gives a revelation
[16:50] [Music]
[17:09] let me read it again here
[17:21] let me just take this part
[17:24] at that day
[17:27] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[17:30] catching at Crystal
[17:33] which day
[17:36] when the Revelation is made known
[17:42] the Revelation the revelation of God is
[17:46] made known in a freefold
[17:52] as this as I have read then
[17:57] that is
[18:00] also in a three-fold
[18:05] if we are not part of the threefold
[18:11] would come with a different Ministry
[18:15] [Music]
[18:18] but we are part of the threefold
[18:21] foreign
[18:24] that's why we preach what he preaches
[18:31] amen
[18:34] he doesn't even wait for the pastor to
[18:36] read the first brother Brennan did not
[18:40] receive Revelation by reading foreign
[18:49] God has already put in him
[19:30] you too
[19:46] the thing that I do yes
[19:54] God wouldn't do a thing without Abraham
[19:57] knowing
[20:01] because
[20:04] the Bible says
[20:06] Jesus himself is the Seed of Abraham yes
[20:18] you look at the Lord and
[20:21] Abraham
[20:28] one was Lord one was
[20:35] the Bible says
[20:41] why it says because Lord has his and
[20:45] Abraham had his
[20:48] Lord has
[20:50] okay yes
[20:53] and all that
[21:03] each and every one of them had his own
[21:11] amen like in the church here
[21:16] if we I start to have my own Revelation
[21:23] and I'm a sheep
[21:27] that would mean the Pastor has a
[21:30] revelation to feed the sheep and the
[21:33] Sheep also has their own Revelation
[21:39] Revelation yeah
[21:46] [Applause]
[21:49] that was the problem with lots
[22:29] the rest will see amen
[22:37] the servants
[22:39] is revealed
[22:41] is
[22:47] ATO
[22:53] [Music]
[22:55] will continue me a new brother but
[22:57] listen to this
[23:01] Jesus said yes
[23:09] do we know now
[23:32] [Applause]
[23:34] but I believe that
[23:37] there's a day
[23:38] when we can testify that now we know
[23:44] amen
[23:53] [Applause]
[23:58] in the denomination
[24:03] and the minister will say
[24:07] then open the book amen
[24:13] foreign
[24:29] that is open the book and what
[24:33] is
[24:36] [Music]
[24:37] now
[24:40] uh okay and water okay
[24:46] but when I arrived here in the message
[25:00] foreign
[26:00] the books were opened
[26:06] and there was there's one called The
[26:09] Book of Life
[26:14] says are the books of sinners
[26:22] those were accustomed to the Lake of
[26:24] Fire
[26:25] but
[26:28] those in in the book of life
[26:33] will be judged according to their works
[26:39] but the bride is not in that in those
[26:42] books
[26:47] book of life
[26:52] in the Lamb's Book of Life
[26:55] going to judgment you are not going to
[26:59] stand before the judge foreign
[27:13] [Applause]
[27:26] [Music]
[27:30] it is here in the Bible
[27:32] [Music]
[27:35] we should know who we are
[27:38] [Applause]
[27:43] and we should know where we are going
[27:47] we should know where we are going this
[27:50] is
[27:54] we should know where we come from
[28:02] we should know who we are Nani
[28:08] so we are part of the threefold
[28:10] revelation of God
[28:18] we will see this other part tokomona
[28:22] eternity the Lord willing to more if
[28:25] there will be a tomorrow
[28:31] [Applause]
[28:32] [Music]
[28:37] before we close the book
[28:40] he says Jesus said
[28:43] yes
[28:54] then
[28:57] are you listening closely brother then
[29:00] he says
[29:02] this day
[29:06] at that time it was that day
[29:18] when this Revelation is made known
[29:26] you will know that
[29:28] I am in the uh I am in the father
[29:34] and the father in me
[29:37] and I in you
[29:43] revelation of God
[29:46] that's why even the seventh seal yeah
[29:55] it is only known to those that are part
[29:59] of the threefold
[30:01] ah is
[30:09] [Applause]
[30:22] because pretty
[30:25] it was
[30:26] God
[30:28] it was God it is
[30:36] then the man dropped off
[30:42] the falling away of the man caused the
[30:46] blood of God
[30:48] [Applause]
[30:51] to bring the men back again because
[31:01] [Applause]
[31:04] ready to go
[31:08] [Music]
