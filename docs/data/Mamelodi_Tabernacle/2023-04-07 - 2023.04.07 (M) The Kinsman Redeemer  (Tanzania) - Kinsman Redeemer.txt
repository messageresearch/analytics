Description:
Title: The Kinsman Redeemer. 
Text: Family Business 

This message was preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima in Tanzania at Ubungo End Time Message Church. 
Date: 07-04-2023 M
His opening scripture was Revelation 5: 1 - 7.

Revelation 5:1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. 2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? 3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. 4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. 5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. 6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. 7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.

The pastor showed the audience about the title deed that was given to Adam. That when Adam lost the book, it returned to the hands of the original owner because it contains the family secrets.

The book was kept by the original owner until when Adam was redeemed and the book will then be handed over.
When Adam lost the book he couldn't meet the requirements of Redemption. But the law required a Kinsman redeemer. But the grace of God met the Kinsman redeemer in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

The pastor took reference from: 63-0317E - The Breach Between The Seven Church Ages And The Seven Seals Paragraph 116-123
 
116 Now, oh, my! Now, the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original Owner, Almighty God. The title deed to the earth, and to Eternal Life, when...

what are we going to do now foreign [Music] [Music] uh-huh from the King's Men familiar then from the original owner of the book he took the book and you know what happened here in the book of uh Revelation the title did the scriptures let me find this manifest here chapter 4 of the book of revelation all right chop down four okay if you find that for us brother Revelation chapter 4 from verse 1 after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I had was s idler of a trumpet talking with me which said and I will show these things which must be here after and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was open in heaven and one sat on the throne okay come up here and I will show you now minutes all right son because you can see it from where you are Ibrahim look from the place amen amen so he was supposed to look from a certain place and you know the Bible says the two uh who were with Christ the two who came and the one that remained with Abraham the two went on downtown now the Bible says Abraham stood with the Lord for the Lord spoke to him about what is going he was going on for God said about Abraham shall I hide from Abraham the things so God will tell Abraham everything now the Bible says the next morning Abraham went and stood to where he stood with them amen now John in the spirit that does Scripture standing up here in heaven is just being lifted up now from the church ages and I will show you things amen amen that's where our ministry is not not in the church we are not a church age join in the spirit standing up here in heaven he has just been lifted up now from the church age saw the church ages and then he was taken out in the fourth chapter he said come up here either I'm going to show you things that will come yes you can't see them from there you must come out then I will show you did you know that the bride is now out of the church and he saw one sitting on a throne has changed and he saw one sitting upon the throne you know that's why we are are called the right hand side people no matter tonight the book of redemptions and it was coming down from their right hand corner who stood on the right hands so we see that in the book of seals he was even put within the pyramid pyramid of the Angels amen amen [Applause] he speaks of an angel with the seventh seal um he saw this angel with the seventh seals and at the end of each all now like and he called that's and that angel the seventh seal now then you'll understand why the people say the seven seed is not a review today because if it is not revealed we don't have the title amen amen amen because she is of the his relatives right I read here and and John in the spirit in the spirit you are standing he says in heaven he's just been lifted up now from the church [Music] we were lifted up foreign that's why I'm not addressing a church age all right because as every church has got a spirit all right you know I as I said after God has spoken then I said if you read spiritually the church he was not referring to Jefferson Village all right uh are you are you there if you took a pomodia there is yeah you see it no no amen amen um it took as human King's Men familiar because it was forfeited by a human son because now salsa the relative had to come to take the human form a relative in order to save my relative who was now in the human form I also took a body human forms when he died he died for a relative I feared we are king who died for the relatives amen amen that's what the Bible says died with him California amen amen that's the work of the King's Men yeah foreign [Music] [Applause] amen then that's why now when no one was with you to open the book okay from work it up amen amen no man could open them and no man could understand that book only eventually up to today the book is understood by this people of the bloodline you realize that yes when the book was opened was not open to the world amen amen if it is the book from the throne from the King's Men familiar that's why no one was founded foreign uh [Music] he wrestled and overcome by The Garden of God so money when blood dropped down out of his face he was overcoming [Music] amen get some money that's where he overcame amen baby he had already won the battle a requirements [Music] amen amen why kwanini because all this was the for the key

the last before we we we we we we close their wonderful the kingsman William components [Music] in the hands of The Originals if you are seeing and I read now in the seals it says [Music] 109 paragraph 301 I don't know which versions but that's where he says opened the book and send it down machine to the Earth it's a book of redemption from the king's Menace which is it is uh the Bible says he took the book from day one chance you know how God operates it's from a throne [Music] that's why brother Branham says their first Throne was in heaven the first Throne was in heaven the second was in Jesus [Applause] the real Ministry that comes with authority we we preach we are preaching from a throne ah man amen because that is Authority is from the Thrones we are preaching from our souls from the three of our knees from their Throne find a place amen so for you to believe and see the word of God that's when the waiters come to us amen for the word of God Amen not to the mind of me it will show you why that people saying the seventh seal is not Revenge it will show we will read there's a reason why the people don't see it because when they're still sweating when they were

sales uh who could do it then he says the seals of redemption um took from within himself hey you know it stops things to stand to extend steel Iman he took the book it up from within him was the only one who could do it and he took it from the right hand of him because he himself the book foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] you know there was a a lot of shouts waiting in heaven when the one who was found worthy you read in your Bible after the one was founded let's look at this they was in heaven a lord of Hallelujah Hallelujah Jubilee you believe when the
