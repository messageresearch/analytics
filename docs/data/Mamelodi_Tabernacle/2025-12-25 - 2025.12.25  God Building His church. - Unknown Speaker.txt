Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, brethren, I just want us to go through our dress code. I think we need to repeat this again. And we are praying for brethren to take this very seriously. God bless you. This is coming from our board and from our pastor as well. Our brother will just read through it read that announcement on dress code. The pastor and the church board have observed a concerning trend where some members appear to be drifting away from the standard of modest apparel as taught in scriptures. 1 Timothy 2:9. This behavior risks h bringing reproach upon the church and undermining our testimony. We kindly urge all members to uphold biblical modesty in dress and conduct. Should this matter persist, the pastor and the board may be compelled to address individuals who do not comply in order to maintain order and holiness within the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Can I give round of applause? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I think we are taking this in another level and God bless you as we are doing that. We've got the Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Thank you so much, Brethren. At this time, we've got our pastor, Pastor Maka in the house. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As he approached the pullpit, we've got the children dedication. So, we will request our sisterhanga and sister [music] to bring their children as we sing. Bring them in. Our pastor will come through. Then after dedication of the children, then we will sing our special song to welcome the Holy Ghost. Amen. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Just hold on Basel before we can continue. I also have something here. There are believers from Deon. I think they just come through the family of Zumu. Are they here? &gt;&gt; Zumo family from Deon. They've already stood up. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, they've already stood up. &gt;&gt; Yes. [music] &gt;&gt; Okay. We love you. God bless you. All right. We can continue and sing as we stand up on our feet. Amen. Amen. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring [music] them in from heaven for [singing] bring [music] them in. Bring them [music] in. [singing] Breathe in the heart of Jesus. [music and singing] Bring them. Bring them in. [music] Bring them from the field of sea. Bring [music] them in. Bring them. [music] Bring them in the Jesus. [music] Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in [music] from their feet on sea. Bring [music] them king. Bring [singing] them [music] to us. Greetings, brethren. We are happy to be with you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; May the the God of peace do you well &gt;&gt; ask my [applause] brother &gt;&gt; to read the Bible &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 10 from verse 13-16 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciple rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily, I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe those disciples were saying these are not our members. They're not worshiping with us. Why? Jesus said, "Allah little children, let them come." And then the Bible says he took them in. I believe this also have brought their children to him. Not to an ordinary man but to him. He it pleased him to use man as his agency. When we trace him, sorry, when we trace him, we find always he works behind the veil and that veil is a man. Hey, these sisters must believe today because it takes their faith that they have brought their children to him. God will honor their faith. I'm going to use my hands which are born of a woman born in sin and shame iniquity but by the grace of God I have found grace in his eyes. That's why I'm standing here in his place. That is the name of this one. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, there is a child, young girl in this age where Satan has rose so much more attacking the children even from young age. We are praying for this one, asking you to keep this one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the sake of the faith of their parents. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it a girl or a boy? &gt;&gt; A girl. &gt;&gt; Thank you. placing this child in my hand. &gt;&gt; I believe it's the wish of her parents that in future he may be in the choir singing for the Lord. &gt;&gt; God do what their parents are thinking good about this child. The name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, these are the two children brought by their parents. You know the hearts of their parents. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The wish of their parents about these two children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless the children. Give their parents the desire of their hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; I've got girls here. Let's pray. Father, into thy hand I'm dedicating this child this morning unto you. I put her into your care. Look after her.

Elderle came to me said he wanted to come and fellowship with the children of God. Then I I came from Luen and I came here to see him. Why is he not worshiping? Then he told me why then I have still having his reasons with me and still some of them I'm still investigating them but I've allowed him to come and worship but If perhaps I found it otherwise and I say go back and don't wonder don't you must not wonder say why because I said I'm still having his son has not come to me. But I believe he's in the house. He had to come to me. He must come to see me so that he mustn't just come into the service without see me first. But if he's in the service, he is welcome. Amite. [applause] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. And while we sing our song, &gt;&gt; then we will stand on our feet.

Our way our our way here &gt;&gt; is going to the heart not to the church. &gt;&gt; That's why some are say are talking about the fivefold ministry but they don't know what is fivefold. ministry. &gt;&gt; All right, we've got them here. They didn't prepare them for us only. We don't we also don't make use of them. That's why we will go the other way. Okay, let us go back to the church order.

That's why people call me church order. &gt;&gt; This pastor of yours, Pastor of Church order, &gt;&gt; I will I will never leave church order [applause] &gt;&gt; because if I can leave church order, &gt;&gt; I'm going to be biased. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not going to judge things the same way. If it is then I'll say so then if &gt;&gt; then I will say so. But if I always keep to church order as my pastor has said he announce it here in the church. It's not something which is in the corners. is it was spoken &gt;&gt; in the church. &gt;&gt; There are things which come from corners. I don't care about this. [applause] You may say them the way you want to say them. You will never touch me. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; another trip. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now remember &gt;&gt; when we after this &gt;&gt; I'll come with that church church order. &gt;&gt; It will help us to keep the order. How many would love to keep? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; While we are preaching here, we are preaching just to a small group. &gt;&gt; Thank you. You are repeating the same thing. &gt;&gt; Another one if you have it. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; My d would have failed me. I'm &gt;&gt; pa. Where is pastor? Oh, pastor. H these days I fear to call him my son. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; We may we met way back and I called him my son. I don't know why but later after that I understood why and now here today &gt;&gt; I am fed by myself. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Thank you technical team. &gt;&gt; So wonderful technical team those who say Those or those who say that pastor of yours, &gt;&gt; my pastor said I am your pastor. [applause] &gt;&gt; You clapped the hands when he was saying that. [applause] But now you want to turn back [applause] &gt;&gt; and you will not you will you will never drive me from this pull pit. [applause] No demon in hell will be able to push me. All right, you can play this one. &gt;&gt; Not destined for you for the announce not not a rumor. No, it must officially be announced &gt;&gt; from the pulpit. If it is not announced from the pulpit, then it's a a rumor, an unfounded rumor. So wait for the announcement announcement. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; What I'm doing is what my pastor said. Everything must be announced from the pulpit, not from the corners. Have you heard him? He said if you call me you are Lord. That is Jesus said but if you call your pastor if you call him your pastor you must listen to him. [applause] All right, let me read something here is from my pastor pastor. &gt;&gt; He said shalom shalom. &gt;&gt; I kindly can I kindly be recused from all formal meetings in I have no desire to be involved. I believe that pastor will deal with whatever matters arising. Who is saying this pastor? Those who say pastor pastor here he says pastor will deal with everything in now you will remain with your lie. I want those who are children of God, they must know the truth. &gt;&gt; I want you to bring a quote there. Tonight we are trying to take the word of God and use it. by the power of the Holy Spirit to blow all the indifferences and doubts away from us. All those little light flashy things that that that just doesn't have any foundation and doesn't have any weight in our life. We want to blow it away so that we can find the glorious vein. The vein is Christ. [applause] To find the glorious vein, we are going to use the wind to blow every little thing. That's why I'm using clips here. I'm blowing all the rubbish so that we can remain with the reality and I've commanded the the deacons to arrest anything this which is kept out of the church out of church order they is arrest [applause] because we are not playing here is a church. [applause] If they don't arrest then I will take them away from their position. I will take I will choose another deacon who will arrest bring the docket to me with the judgment then I will check it whether what you are saying is true if it is true because I want the evidence I don't want what you tell me he said this is a You must bring evidence. Then &gt;&gt; I shall ask him or her. &gt;&gt; I will I will say to I will ask them to just excuse themselves from from us. [applause] Because for the church to fail there was there was a there innocent people die because of Achen I don't want innocent people to die here because of many Yeah, [applause] they must arrest. &gt;&gt; I tell you, &gt;&gt; you'll see things. [cheering] [applause] Another one. &gt;&gt; I truly believe that every word of God, every promise that he made is just true and it is to anybody will accept it. And now there is some who try to accept it and cannot. Some try to accept it but they cannot. Why? I will tell you. There is others who can accept and some get it without half trying. That is that we have to preach the gospel that healing is for all. Yet we know it is not. It is to all if they can receive it. But we know that they all cannot receive it. But when we preach, we say healing is for all. But we know it's not for all. I just want to be as honest with you as I know how to be. We have to preach salvation the same way that salvation is for all but we know that all cannot receive him. All men cannot see these things. Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes that can see your understanding, for there is many that cannot understand." Stand up on your feet. [applause] Let's open the book of Matthew. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 16. &gt;&gt; Matthew 16 &gt;&gt; 13- 20. &gt;&gt; Uh 13- 18. &gt;&gt; 13- 20 &gt;&gt; or 13- 20. When Jesus came into the coast of Cesia Philip, he asked his disciples, saying, "Whom do men say I, the son of man, am?" And they said, "Some say that thou art John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremiah's or one of the prophets." He said unto them, "But whom say ye that I am?" And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God?" And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed are thou Simon Bjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt lose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Let's just close our eyes. &gt;&gt; My dear heavenly father, standing here &gt;&gt; through your mercy. I'm not prone to stand here, but by grace I'm not better than all the people who are sitting down there because you know their hearts &gt;&gt; and you know my hearts too. But I pray heavenly father. Use my voice &gt;&gt; and my brother's voice. Let us convey &gt;&gt; your message to your children. &gt;&gt; Not what I wish but your message. &gt;&gt; I pray heavenly father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may take your seat. I'm going to have a very small topic and that topic will be God building his church. I'm not going to preach but to teach. I'm not I'm going to try to do that because in fact preaching preaching is for sinners and sinners don't like preaching. But teaching is for believers, &gt;&gt; the bride, &gt;&gt; not for sinners. &gt;&gt; Let me read in this book of adoption, adoption, &gt;&gt; um, paragraph six, paragraph six. &gt;&gt; Bible teaching is usually a treacherous Amen. and lately you know kind of working out of the thin ice we call it but we just feel that maybe at this point at this time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what I thing, a complete understanding positionally for what we are in Christ and sometimes I think that preaching is wonderful thing but I believe sometimes brother that teaching goes beyond that. A kind of a kind of a special especially in the church. Now preaching usually catches the sinner bring him under condemnation by the weight. But teaching places man positionally what he is. And we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally. We know what we are. I'm saying preaching is for sinners. In other words, &gt;&gt; I can't come here &gt;&gt; and preach to you &gt;&gt; because you are the bride. How can I preach to the bride? Because the bride is called. The Bible says many are called but few are chosen. And the few chosen is the bride. Amen. And when he was revealing the seals, he was collecting his subject to together. And the bride is the seed of God. that now at this time God is collecting his seat because now the the the shark has moved away from the shark. The shark has moved away from the seat to allow the seat to be contact with the sun. But you see when we are looking at the development of the seed, it start by the blade there. When it moves there, it becomes a stock. But when it becomes a stop, the leaves remain there, but they are now dry. But they still there. But they are dry. Why been there? They are waiting for the harvest time. When they when the harvest has come, they will be bent after the seed is taken up. Then these other things will be bent. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the bride is the seat. &gt;&gt; God has already gathered his Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he revealed the seals, the Bible says God revealed the seals and they see them because they are ordained to see. But those who are not ordained that's why always you will say when you say he is no more my immediate they will say why what in other words you mean we are not safe and we don't wonder when we we don't wonder when people say that because If you [snorts] don't know marble hall and you were taught about marble hall you see sometime another man and can tell you otherwise about marble and you will believe because you don't know but the one who knows if somebody comes and try to talk about he will This one doesn't know. &gt;&gt; He has moved when the lamb stood up from his father's throne to take the book from the right hand of the wife who sees on the throne. He was no more a lamp. He was no more a mediator. He was now a lion. Where did he took the book from? Because they say he took the book from his father's throne. What was his father's throne? Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus was his father's throne. Where did he took the book from? He took the book from within himself. And the prophet said, he took that book and open it and release the seals to came down with the book and went to his own throne. If you don't know this &gt;&gt; because these are hidden man. Amen. God said to the prophet store the food. The famine is coming but man will arise. who will go and took those hidden money and give them to the church. &gt;&gt; All right. We are this. We are the bride. You must know who you are. You must know the time you are living in. &gt;&gt; If you don't know the time you are living in, you'll always ask what is the time now? Because you don't have something to show you the time. But if you know the time, if someone comes, you said now it's 8:00, you just look at him because you know now it's not 8:00. But those who don't know the time, &gt;&gt; they will go this way. They said, "No, it's 8." &gt;&gt; No, it's not 8. It's 10. 10. &gt;&gt; No, it's not 10. &gt;&gt; I say 10 &gt;&gt; because they don't know &gt;&gt; the time they are living and they don't know who they are. The elder said, &gt;&gt; "Our pastors have placed us &gt;&gt; in the land because we crossed over. &gt;&gt; And there were there there were people who when they were about to cross over, they said, "Hey, Joshua, hey, we we hear you. We love you. &gt;&gt; But there is a land this side of Jordan. &gt;&gt; Could you please can you allow us just to occupy? But don't worry when you go to fight that side. We will join you. But after the fight, we will come back. Ah, &gt;&gt; don't worry. &gt;&gt; You see when go Jesus was commanding his disciples, he said, "Go and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. I want to give you a trend, &gt;&gt; a trend, a sequence. &gt;&gt; He said after baptizing them, you must teach them. Amen. You preach. When they repent, you baptize them. After baptism, then don't preach. &gt;&gt; You teach. That is the sequence, &gt;&gt; the system, &gt;&gt; preach, &gt;&gt; baptize, &gt;&gt; and teach. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, &gt;&gt; I'm going to build my church. There are churches which which were built by men, not God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to diminish or undermine other churches. &gt;&gt; It is built &gt;&gt; or started by men. and he has got the right to say this is my church my father's church IPC IPC they are fighting now they said that's why I don't want fight here [applause] they are fighting Someone said, "You see when the pastor pass away because I came wrong, I've seen pastors passed away. When the pastor has passed away, someone will come." When I when I was last with the pastor, the pastor said to me, "Follow me." Then I followed the pastor. I walk in the footstep of the pastor. Reuben is is a witness. And he said it was meaning I'm going to follow him when he has passed. The other one said, "I was with a pastor at De and I I paid for him to go there. You don't know what he told me when it's not what the pastor told you. It's what God said. It's what church order said. That is what we follow. We are not following what the pastor has said. We don't make our pastor an ancestor. [applause] He said here I leave you with church order. Now we must follow the church order. When our pastor is passed, then we go back to church order. What does the church order say? Let me tell you, there are two groups in the church. And those two groups, they have got their leaders. They are taking the church to be a political party. Each and every leader He's conversing and his follower, they're conversing for their leader. That thing will not work here. [cheering] [applause] We will go back to church order. I always thank God that we have not chosen the pastor first. Would have made a mess. When we have when we are taking our time, &gt;&gt; when we are taking our time now, we can see the loose ends and we fix them so that when time comes to choose the path, then we will be one. Another one said after the death of another pastor he came the pastor said there must be the pastor after him I'm not some people will say here they will say you are talking a lie But what they saying they must know who they are saying is talking lie. That thing will follow them until your sin will catch you up. [cheering] You may no know you might be proud. I told him you are supporters. &gt;&gt; He he told him, &gt;&gt; she told him, you are pouring fire on that the head of that sister or the brother. Even David &gt;&gt; was afraid of Saul. &gt;&gt; Even even though Saul was big, &gt;&gt; he said this is the anointed of God. [applause] &gt;&gt; Respect the pulpit. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; "I'm going to build my church." God, &gt;&gt; not men. &gt;&gt; God, but God will will always use men &gt;&gt; to build then not men using God. But God, you see men to build his church. When you you will stand up there. When God was using me to build this church, God held me, &gt;&gt; not I &gt;&gt; because he said I am going to build it. &gt;&gt; Not somebody else. &gt;&gt; You cannot you cannot boast. But he got Jesus said, "I'm going to build my church." And Paul &gt;&gt; warned the pastors, "Read it, my brother. I think is Acts 20 verse 28." &gt;&gt; Verse 28. When Paul &gt;&gt; was warning the pastors about God's church, &gt;&gt; read it, my brother. &gt;&gt; Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost have made you overseers. &gt;&gt; Who made you overseers? The Holy Spirit take heat of the flock which the Holy Ghost has made you over to feed the church of God which he have purchased with his own blood. Who has purchased this church? God himself. Feed the church of God. Not your church. Feed the church of God which he has purchased with his own blood. [cheering] My pastor said I'm pleased. I'm now I am fit. I'm fed by my own son. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; because I believe where he is. He He He see what I'm doing. I think he's saying amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I knew my son would do that. He He will never let the church fight. [cheering] He has purchased &gt;&gt; his church with his own blood. &gt;&gt; He built it himself. No one wrote himself and no one will stop that church. We can't say these things will stop the church from the rapture. We'll be talking a lie. Nothing will stop that church. Nothing. Nothing because the one who has built it is responsible to look after that church. Don't intimidate people. You must do this. If you don't do this, then you will. It's not about what you are doing is about what God has done. What planned from the beginning. What is happening is just on the plan of God. And you cannot we can't change that plan. Even demons cannot change the plan of God. Let me tell you when Satan tries to to disturb the plan of God after he has worked and he he was sweating. When he look back trying to wipe his head, he found that he was doing the will of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot do nothing. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know uh yoga technical team I want you to put the book the power of transform the power of transformation. &gt;&gt; Yes that is that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It said there &gt;&gt; God is going to have a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me say today God has a church. Amen. The prophet was saying God is going to have a church. But today I say God has a church. He says there I don't care how many dark ages we go through and whatever more he is going to have a church without spot and drinking whether we whether we are part of it or not because he has already set in It was going to happen. &gt;&gt; It's going to be there. It is there. You see, &gt;&gt; you cannot tell the sheep sheep. &gt;&gt; You must manufacture wool because you are a sheep. To show that you are a sheep, manufacture wool. You are wasting your time. &gt;&gt; When the sheep is grass and drink water, the wool will come out and the farmer will take the wool. In other words, he's taking what belong the right of the sheep. And the sheep &gt;&gt; cannot complain. &gt;&gt; When you see a person complaining &gt;&gt; is not the sheep [applause] is a goat. You see, you cannot change a goat to be bishop. Whatever you do, it will go. When it looked at the the workers there sailing tomatoes, it will go there and pick one. When they throw it, it will jump with a tomato in his mouth. because &gt;&gt; it is the nature &gt;&gt; of a goat. &gt;&gt; But sometimes a sheep may go with the goats. Then because it is used to go with the goats, it may try to take the the ways of the goat. But when you take it back, you are not a goat. You are a sheep. When you take it to the right position, it will say it will say thank you. Now this is this is my position. When you take a goat You take vote this is your position. He will tell others they say this is my position. It's a lie. I think my position &gt;&gt; I am not preaching here to scorn people. &gt;&gt; No no no. Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; But I'm bringing mirror &gt;&gt; so that you can look inside and see if whether you are having the characteristics of a goat. Then you leave that because you are not a goat. Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you see things &gt;&gt; happen because of the seed inside. We can see it from back there. God tried to warn Cain. You see Abel if you can pray like Abel when he s he says those things pain was becoming more angry he said my brother is better than me. But if it is a child of God, he say sorry I will take this. &gt;&gt; Don't worry church. &gt;&gt; I'm here. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me speak in Afghans. the Bob dance. Those that has fats in their mouth, &gt;&gt; they will spew them out. But as such, &gt;&gt; the gates of hell will fight against it, but they will not prevail because it was really sad that they will never when people try to fight us, when people try to fight I don't wonder because it is prophesied and I know they will never prevail [cheering] because the church is ordained. Paul &gt;&gt; calls it &gt;&gt; the body &gt;&gt; of Christ. He says in the book of Colossians &gt;&gt; chapter 1 verse 18 I believe &gt;&gt; chapter 1 verse 18 &gt;&gt; he says he is the head of his body &gt;&gt; the church &gt;&gt; he is the church he is the head &gt;&gt; of his body the church &gt;&gt; in other words the church &gt;&gt; is his body. Amen. &gt;&gt; How can the body separate itself from the head? Because it is already set. The church will never be separated with the body. And the prophet &gt;&gt; calls the church the family of God. But when was when God was building his church, he built the church from the Gentiles because Joseph typed it when he married, that beautiful Egyptian a gentile. He was typing that &gt;&gt; that Christ is going to have his wife from the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; The prophet says there is a church which the roots thereof is Jewish but the body is gentile. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is the church &gt;&gt; which God has built. &gt;&gt; He says here &gt;&gt; when he talks about &gt;&gt; he says by is God's provided place of worship. I think whether they will &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much. by one spirit. We are all baptized into the body and that body is a female. The body which body Christ &gt;&gt; and that body is a family and the family of God that is the house of God and the house of God is the name of Jesus. Paul said, &gt;&gt; "We must take a wife of Christ from the Gentiles for his name." That's why he says that the house of God is the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and the name of the Lord Jesus is a mighty tower. If you want to run to the tower, where are you going? Where are you running to? To his church. Because that is where his name is. Amen. That's right. It's a mighty tower. The Russians run into it and they are safe. Can you go down below that &gt;&gt; if you don't know then I will read something here. All right. If they don't have it, let me read something here. &gt;&gt; But in a place where I choose to put my name. All right. Let me read something here. He says, I have choose to put my name at the door of my worship. For my family will be gathered in there. My house, my children, born of my genes. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. My genes are in them. I put my weight in them. I write them upon the tables of their heart. That is my family. The family of the book of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the family and he says here &gt;&gt; in this page 237, &gt;&gt; more 237. &gt;&gt; No, the family of God that is that is that. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said the family of God &gt;&gt; obey the order of the father of the family. When someone said that church, &gt;&gt; is he one of the family member? Because the family of God obeys the order of the father of the family. How can you call me Lord &gt;&gt; when you don't listen to my words? &gt;&gt; I've chosen pastors. I've chosen them to be my witness on earth. He said here, he said, "I'll give you pastors who will feed you with knowledge &gt;&gt; and understanding I will come back here. &gt;&gt; Let me stop here. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Sunday &gt;&gt; I will be with you. [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is uh my precious brother? &gt;&gt; Brother, take your platform. I give [music] [singing] all the Oh, I &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Go back.

Oh God, every time when it is preached from the heart of God, &gt;&gt; it becomes a mirror unto us &gt;&gt; and we look unto it and look at ourselves in it. where we see there is some spots. Oh God, we ask your word to please us. &gt;&gt; Lord, it is so true that this church was not built by any man. It is so true that we have got nothing to do with it. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Honestly, we found it here. It brings the word that the pastor spoke about very true &gt;&gt; that you said I will build my church. &gt;&gt; Whom are we Lord to try and correct it? &gt;&gt; Lord we say [music] thank you that you've given us pastors. It is never ours to correct. &gt;&gt; This is your church. Oh God. &gt;&gt; We are your body. &gt;&gt; We give ourselves as living sacrifice. Oh God.

We commit ourselves unto you. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we may do other things and unaware that they are wrong, &gt;&gt; but it's not our intention.

May it be Lord done according to thy will. We like to thank you father that we called the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Acts [applause] chapter 2 from verse 36-39. Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom he hath crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. I love [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; beauty. Exactly. Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We live [singing] there. [music] &gt;&gt; Shallore.
