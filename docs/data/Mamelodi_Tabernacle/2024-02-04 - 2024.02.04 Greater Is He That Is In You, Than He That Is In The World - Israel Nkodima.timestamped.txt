[1:27:37] it because the Lord has
[1:27:40] spoken and these things now have been
[1:27:45] manifested all right amen H there was
[1:27:51] where
[1:27:52] the prophet of God spoke of something
[1:27:56] here and
[1:28:00] uh
[1:28:01] although
[1:28:03] the our
[1:28:06] part of which we are going to run
[1:28:11] it
[1:28:14] Greater is
[1:28:17] he that is in us us
[1:28:26] which
[1:28:30] one all right
[1:28:34] amen let me look at something
[1:28:39] here you know I we read something some
[1:28:43] time
[1:28:45] back from the book ashamed of him page
[1:28:48] five paragraph
[1:28:51] one
[1:28:52] where the men of God
[1:28:54] said my Ministry isn't finished in
[1:29:02] Africa then I've got this part
[1:29:05] here that says a prophet visits South
[1:29:11] Africa
[1:29:14] afria then it says
[1:29:16] here where he said to the
[1:29:20] people got to go to Africa according to
[1:29:25] a
[1:29:29] vision all right am and you know of some
[1:29:33] other
[1:29:35] quotations where he spoke about
[1:29:41] Africa
[1:29:43] and not for
[1:29:46] politics he he
[1:29:49] said uh he spoke about the one who
[1:29:54] is did he say more spiritual or a vision
[1:29:59] what what did it say about the
[1:30:08] African all right you don't
[1:30:11] know
[1:30:13] okay all right amen um let's start
[1:30:19] here and uh because we have read the
[1:30:25] scripture on the
[1:30:28] agenda the
[1:30:30] following to
[1:30:33] happen is now the
[1:30:38] rupture so I believe you are
[1:30:43] listening what's on the
[1:30:45] agenda the the next thing to
[1:30:49] happen is the rapture
[1:30:55] amen when soon and very
[1:31:00] soon then we have go after
[1:31:06] that which forces are reging
[1:31:13] again and the prophet
[1:31:16] says now when the
[1:31:20] bride takes off
[1:31:23] the the battles will
[1:31:26] start and you GL that you are not part
[1:31:29] of
[1:31:33] those you know Abraham Abraham when
[1:31:37] maybe the newspapers would go
[1:31:42] around saying we see the sign of Fire or
[1:31:45] the sign of
[1:31:48] what amen amen that was not Abraham's
[1:31:56] news no because he was not part of
[1:32:03] it now the chaos that is
[1:32:08] coming you as a son or daughter of
[1:32:15] God it's not for you
[1:32:18] I what's left for you is
[1:32:25] rupture nothing
[1:32:28] else you won't
[1:32:32] B
[1:32:34] amen the water won't touch
[1:32:37] you because that was not the promise for

[1:37:36] soul if it is not in the
[1:37:39] soul then it can't remain in the
[1:37:45] mind because
[1:37:47] mind is
[1:37:50] worldly
[1:37:52] it can take something
[1:37:54] now tomorrow it has forgotten all
[1:38:00] about but if it is in the

[1:39:02] fulfilled
[1:39:04] amen it won't be
[1:39:07] repeated let there be
[1:39:10] light that's all then follows
[1:39:15] manifestation and there was
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:19] life amen he never repeat it
[1:39:22] again
[1:39:24] no if God says

[1:41:27] things are
[1:41:32] uncal they are coming from back

[1:43:25] called yes
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:44] amen
[1:43:45] Millennium but we will pass that
[1:43:49] way
[1:43:52] Millennium Here Comes
[1:43:56] again we went through
[1:43:59] that is there anyone here who can uh
[1:44:07] rewind back
[1:44:12] to the first one and the second one
[1:44:18] amen you see this thing
[1:44:22] the ministry is not
[1:44:26] just not
[1:44:28] Jesus yes he but after
[1:44:32] that he shows you
[1:44:40] things real Christianity when you talk
[1:44:42] about real Christianity we are not
[1:44:44] talking about a
[1:44:49] nonsmoker no we are talking about
[1:44:52] somebody with the
[1:44:55] knowledge of God in
[1:44:59] him and all the
[1:45:02] events he said shall I hide from
[1:45:07] Abraham the things that I
[1:45:11] do so if you are a Seed of
[1:45:14] Abraham then God goes hand in hand with
[1:45:19] you he will show you all
[1:45:23] this Abraham now I'm going
[1:45:30] to and he said before the fire there he
[1:45:36] said shall I
[1:45:38] hide from
[1:45:42] Abraham he
[1:45:44] couldn't because Abraham was part of
[1:45:49] you amen we went through this thing
[1:45:53] Battle of
[1:45:55] amagon Amen I fear to ask you question
[1:46:01] this we were with the brothers home they
[1:46:04] are
[1:46:07] here I the question was
[1:46:16] of who
[1:46:19] fighting amen
[1:46:22] I found
[1:46:27] that it's
[1:46:30] there you see amen now I realize
[1:46:34] that the word of
[1:46:42] God you can have slides with you but
[1:46:48] still you have no answer because the
[1:46:53] ministry does not reside in the slides
[1:46:57] but in the
[1:46:59] [Applause]
[1:47:01] heart the word of
[1:47:03] God doesn't on the
[1:47:07] slide in the heart the soul
[1:47:11] soul is the one that contains all this
[1:47:16] amen like you
[1:47:19] realize like now H Soul Ministry it's a
[1:47:24] soul
[1:47:25] Ministry
[1:47:29] because all the things that God
[1:47:33] spoke not really but
[1:47:37] living in your
[1:47:44] soul you cannot keep the word of God
[1:47:47] with your
[1:47:49] head theology it becomes theology but
[1:47:53] theology is not Revelation
[1:47:56] Theology and Revelation is not
[1:48:02] theology Revelation is
[1:48:11] something
[1:48:14] amen you know he
[1:48:17] says the seven colors of the rainbow
[1:48:25] they
[1:48:26] came The Next Step from
[1:48:29] there he speaks of
[1:48:31] the
[1:48:41] logos is the thing you receive the word
[1:48:45] with
[1:48:47] army the word does not reign in the head
[1:48:52] the word stays in the heart
[1:48:54] amen not the the physical heart refer to
[1:48:58] the soul it refers to the soul amen now
[1:49:03] how the soul soul how it is able to keep
[1:49:07] these
[1:49:08] things it is
[1:49:10] because uh to
[1:49:12] you there is no starting point of those
[1:49:17] things you were in his mind
[1:49:22] before the foundation of the
[1:49:24] world you see that scripture
[1:49:29] says grieve
[1:49:31] not the holy spirit of
[1:49:38] God that scripture my brother we were
[1:49:43] chosen
[1:49:46] before now the
[1:49:49] world that's why the Bible
[1:49:51] says Luke
[1:49:53] 17 we are not of
[1:49:58] this warant amen is that right that
[1:50:04] means
[1:50:09] knowledge
[1:50:14] knowled it is not or it not start with
[1:50:17] this world Amen is that
[1:50:26] right you've got what knowledge do you
[1:50:30] have there's some men that
[1:50:34] said when they were talking about
[1:50:39] education because when you got born you
[1:50:42] didn't have any education amen amen
[1:50:49] amen
[1:50:50] education is something that comes to
[1:50:52] your
[1:50:54] head but the word of God does not come
[1:50:58] to the Head ler to the soul it comes to
[1:51:01] the soul amen the soul soul is The
[1:51:06] Keeper of the word of
[1:51:10] God that's why who is this why in the
[1:51:14] book who is this
[1:51:16] madc where he says uh
[1:51:20] your
[1:51:24] soul is
[1:51:30] subject I'm trying to put
[1:51:34] it the real
[1:51:39] body that can keep the word of
[1:51:42] God is the
[1:51:46] soul the message
[1:51:48] believer
[1:51:50] it's not your
[1:51:53] head it's your
[1:51:56] soul how come that you find the
[1:52:01] people
[1:52:03] uh he comes
[1:52:10] here all
[1:52:13] things then he goes into
[1:52:18] things I hear them say
[1:52:20] going to
[1:52:21] things but who is going to
[1:52:25] things you see amen but the child of
[1:52:32] God God stays in the
[1:52:36] soul not this
[1:52:40] fleshly this one just PMS blood
[1:52:44] only when you die it stops
[1:52:48] amen
[1:52:50] there's no longer anything to do with
[1:52:53] blood there okay
[1:52:55] amen millenum Millennium
[1:52:59] another white Throne judgment white
[1:53:02] judgment New
[1:53:04] Jerusalem you can't keep these
[1:53:06] things you can't keep them in your
[1:53:14] head the the place of all these things
[1:53:20] the
[1:53:23] Rapture ble
[1:53:25] of Millennium millenum
[1:53:29] another white thr judgment New
[1:53:32] Jerusalem all these
[1:53:35] things they are not they are not
[1:53:40] without if you are a child of
[1:53:42] God they are
[1:53:45] registered your
[1:53:48] soul amen
[1:53:51] that's the thing all right before we
[1:53:54] Clos I was looking at
[1:53:58] this
[1:54:02] H there was this scripture where it
[1:54:09] says come up
[1:54:13] here come
[1:54:16] here Revelation chapter
[1:54:21] 21 there's two
[1:54:24] places you have Revelation chter
[1:54:28] 4 where where it says come up
[1:54:31] here and I will show you things to
[1:54:37] come you should know that if you are a
[1:54:40] child of God as he said about
[1:54:43] Abraham shall I hide from
[1:54:48] Abraham Abraham being the
[1:54:51] seed so
[1:54:54] God has to talk to
[1:54:59] Abraham if he's going to
[1:55:04] burn Sodom he tells
[1:55:09] Abraham everything he told Abraham
[1:55:16] everything
[1:55:17] now if that was it
[1:55:20] even
[1:55:21] today he's talking to the
[1:55:28] seed if you
[1:55:30] plant
[1:55:34] wheat the
[1:55:37] seed because the the power of the whole
[1:55:43] structure is coming
[1:55:48] from all right
[1:55:50] Amen in everything you
[1:55:53] do it's from the
[1:55:56] [Music]
[1:55:57] seed amen why they say Seed of
[1:56:04] Abraham it is a
[1:56:06] seed that will grow to
[1:56:13] see another seat will never
[1:56:18] see
[1:56:20] amen it hasn't got that law of
[1:56:25] growth
[1:56:27] amen it
[1:56:29] can't for it to
[1:56:33] see it is a
[1:56:37] seed now the Seed of
[1:56:41] Abraham could
[1:56:47] see MC was God
[1:56:52] was
[1:56:55] Jesus but for the
[1:56:59] citiz and the citizens
[1:57:05] of amen amen they
[1:57:12] know we are coming there we are going to
[1:57:15] if the Lord
[1:57:17] willing we we've got that
[1:57:21] building because the
[1:57:23] city is built like a
[1:57:28] pyramid and the bride of
[1:57:31] Christ shap like a
[1:57:35] pyramid amen all right amen now these
[1:57:39] things are not for a church
[1:57:43] go it's for the
[1:57:47] seed amen you
[1:57:51] change into something
[1:57:56] else no as the if the seed is
[1:58:01] wheat there's no way you can convince it
[1:58:04] of something
[1:58:07] else once
[1:58:10] planted it comes
[1:58:12] up to
[1:58:14] reproduce
[1:58:16] seed the same seed all right let's look
[1:58:20] at this now I was just reading this
[1:58:23] showing
[1:58:25] this events
[1:58:29] here now the last one it said Revelation
[1:58:33] chapter
[1:58:37] 21 uh can we read
[1:58:40] it perhaps Revelation 21 from verse
[1:58:45] 9 and there came unto me one of the
[1:58:48] seven angels which had seven vials full
[1:58:51] of the seven last plagues and talked
[1:58:54] with me saying come hither I will show
[1:58:57] Thee the bride the Lamb's wife amen
[1:59:01] amen that's why we've heard us talking
[1:59:04] about angels
[1:59:08] now because we were let up
[1:59:15] today about angels
[1:59:20] the
[1:59:20] reason the people they say the seven is
[1:59:24] not
[1:59:26] revealed they didn't even see the angel
[1:59:29] with the
[1:59:37] seven didn't we see
[1:59:42] it the angel
[1:59:45] with now that's why a m man
[1:59:50] cannot see
[1:59:51] it with the
[1:59:55] angel amen amen and the prophet of
[1:59:59] God was even
[2:00:02] put into the
[2:00:05] Pyramid of those
[2:00:10] angels then the
[2:00:13] ministry as you see the ministry
[2:00:17] now he had to
[2:00:21] [Music]
[2:00:23] go let me tell you st man was
[2:00:30] put in
[2:00:33] Eden but now you hear the prophet always
[2:00:37] says I went
[2:00:40] w then once if he says I went
[2:00:45] West expect an angel amen
[2:00:50] [Music]
[2:00:53] I went West to pick
[2:00:57] up
[2:01:00] because when I will read it to
[2:01:03] you when he was
[2:01:06] put into the conell
[2:01:12] constellation of the
[2:01:17] Angels uh
[2:01:20] I've been following
[2:01:23] [Music]
[2:01:24] and hearing people
[2:01:27] talking never have i at any
[2:01:31] time
[2:01:32] somebody talking about the revelation of
[2:01:35] the
[2:01:40] angels
[2:01:42] and to know where the seventh
[2:01:48] is
[2:01:49] it's when
[2:01:51] after you have
[2:01:53] seen the seventh
[2:01:57] angel not a man at this
[2:02:00] time amen the seventh
[2:02:03] angel here
[2:02:06] on met the
[2:02:12] seventh uh the
[2:02:15] rupture Rapture can take uh uh I don't
[2:02:20] know how much I
[2:02:25] weigh but these days I wait has left me
[2:02:29] a
[2:02:32] bit now I don't believe
[2:02:38] that
[2:02:41] your
[2:02:42] body of
[2:02:46] Flesh knows anything about the
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:02:55] it is
[2:02:57] like there there there's some people
[2:03:00] there's two things
[2:03:02] here your your
[2:03:06] body your natural
[2:03:09] man can talk about the
[2:03:14] rupture amen
[2:03:17] amen but if you look at that
[2:03:22] person you don't see any sign of rapture
[2:03:27] with such a
[2:03:31] person a
[2:03:34] person a
[2:03:36] soul that is going in the
[2:03:40] rupture is every time tuned
[2:03:47] up
[2:03:50] to the
[2:03:52] channel because these things come like
[2:03:57] channels there's a channel for the
[2:04:03] RT and once a
[2:04:07] person has been
[2:04:12] called and is the rapture
[2:04:17] material
[2:04:19] he knows the
[2:04:22] channel because
[2:04:25] already in that
[2:04:28] person you know sometimes you even feel
[2:04:33] like you you saying to
[2:04:37] yourself here is the
[2:04:42] rupture you are so much ready for the
[2:04:46] Rapture you can feel it
[2:04:49] [Applause]
[2:04:53] and every
[2:04:54] time there is something in
[2:04:57] you that it's not only soon and very
[2:05:02] soon but it's something
[2:05:05] in you know
[2:05:08] like H spiritually
[2:05:13] sing that something is about to happen
[2:05:17] something
[2:05:19] to
[2:05:22] take you see things like that that's why
[2:05:25] the Bible
[2:05:26] says of
[2:05:29] Enoch he didn't only read
[2:05:34] about no he
[2:05:38] started
[2:05:40] working because it was
[2:05:44] already in
[2:05:47] him why he started to
[2:05:51] walk and the Bible says he walked with
[2:05:57] God and he

[2:09:22] hands spoken hatred with spoken
[2:09:28] word God is
[2:09:34] love his love is not like human
[2:09:46] love imagine say he loves you because of

[2:10:52] meat no God loved the

[2:11:44] Al while you are in
[2:11:47] sin
