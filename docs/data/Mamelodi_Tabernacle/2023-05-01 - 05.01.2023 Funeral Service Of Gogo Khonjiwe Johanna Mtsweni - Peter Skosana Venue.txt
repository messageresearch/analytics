you're proud to say that I'm the best daughter in law and even where they are they are saying we are the proudest daughters in law because safigula isn't is Anthony is they were born again you know everything you know the best institution that you could ever have for all the families and the relationship is God because um but we make an error that we consider other things and not consider God who instituted us with friends every every relationship it's there in the word of God because she was a special woman in my life and in all of us being a jungle Bank um she was the same thing that she did to me she did to others she was unique and then you know she didn't even give us pressure she will Embrace us and she will love us even my father-in-law because you could see that you know Elizabeth you know when I was a young person I was praying with this this best friend of mine we're praying and so it was it was it was like dead Sasha telems in I remember when I came to Honeymoon back to Honeymoon 5 o'clock foreign foreign [Music] and because he gave me the permission I excelled in cooking so um so the best thing out of all because we are paying tribute to my mother-in-law I'm not crying I'm celebrating the life that I spent with her she loved me I loved her and I did everything that I could ever done to her you know it was not about money it is whatever I could have done to her I did hence we we build a good relationships foreign foreign [Applause] because I said it's my mother it's not my mother-in-law the law officially gave me to be my mother so the same way that I treat my mother is the same way that I must treat my mother-in-law so greetings her father that is lastly as I'm I'm closing and appreciating um is is appeal you know um it absorbs so if a man's anger Lily yeah if it's an acid I absorb if a mans are clean yeah absolutely absorb so he said life is like that um because there are so many things in this world but it depends on you what is because if uh but you won't see it okay the only thing that you will see it is when you start squeezing it when squish it is a release I learned to a absolute so that is why I said you know in here I absorb so many things from my mother-in-law hence when challenges are coming like this all I can squeeze are the good things and the good memories that then the relationship that I have with my mother-in-law I never regretted it you know I'm the last person and she died I think I was still in the hospital when the way they explained and I made him to talk and you could see the excitement that was happening it was um so I squeezing in my spirit I'm squeezing good things I'm Excuse me the teaching that my mother-in-law must listen together he was encouraging us and telling us because I mean I didn't have an experience of being a daughter-in-law it was the first time I get married it was the first time to be yeah but what shaped us to be like this only the weight trust in God and Trust in the weight it will shape you and make you the person to become but you know the greatest teacher and the greatest institution that can that can be is God in his way when you align him your marriage will never fail your in-laws will never fail you no matter how difficult it is whether you will give the best out of the past and you will reap the best out of the best because what you sow is what you reap God bless

saw in here is that she was a servant of the Living God you know as Christians our lives are cultured by the word and our lives ought to preach the gospel it's not about what we say but Our lives our actions everything about us ought to preach the Gospels and this is what I saw from OK Google and all the speakers who came here they've been speaking so wonderful about him about how she believed and trusted in the Living God now life for a child of God is about the word he is about doing the words so we are cultured by the word descriptions but I'm here today just to say to the family that celebrate her life because she lived her life she was cultured by the world and we could say that song is but I want to give you a scripture in the book of Psalm 147 verse number 3 the Bible says he

while my Elder is coming foreign [Music] rather do drugs by day and by now Jesus [Music] I would like to greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ is uh I would like to greet the pastors I'm sure you all heard Pastor magua when he was introducing me he said we'll call our Elder what is this is he did not say a pasta so yesterday I was saying please pray for me so that I don't um brag about myself because they are my pastors they are supposed preaching here so I don't know what they've seen in me um we've been together in the field for many years and I also like to greet our pasta from the Eastern Cape is called me obas to go back and faster we've been together this field [Music] and I would also like to create them family and everybody that has gathered here in the name of my Lord Jesus Christ my name is the surname is kosana and then I said yesterday [Music] um uh I'm one of the proud because I there's always a saying about us among the world which is we are believers in summer in winter time we forget that we are believers since I repented have been a Christian All Seasons okay let's just read the the word in the Book of Luke and what in galuka Saint Luke chapter 17. 17. once again to explain why are we using English because in our assembly we've got quite a number of branches and different people in different languages some understand only English so there is a live streaming so um so they are watching us so we like to accommodate everybody um let's read Luke 17 let's read from the 20th verse up to the 30th verse 10 verses 30. now it says and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation foreign [Music] um neither should they say law here or lower the or therefore behold the kingdom of God is within you 40. and you say it unto his disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and you shall not see it is and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them no follow them Nancy for as the lightning that lighted out of the one out of the one part of under Heaven shine it unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man says each they drank they married wives they were giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all was likewise also as it was in the days of Lord they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it [Music] but the same thing that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and Destroy them allotted events even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed let's power our heads up gracious Lord we are gathered here Lord Almighty in the funeral service of our sister of which we believe Lord Almighty is in the sixth dimension father we are gathered here as people that has got a revelation of the weight knowing that all the Mysteries that were hidden are now revealed Lord so for us it's just to bring the manifestation of what has been revealed and father as the word says let he that is filthy be filthy still and that he that is Holy be holy still amen bless this family or Lord and bless everybody that has gathered here may you be the one Lord Almighty that will preach to us father we pray in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated okay um the scripture that we have read um touches much about the son of man touches much about the kingdom of God and then it says here it is a kingdom of God cometh not with observation it is now actually why should we read the word of God in a funeral is or in most of the occasions it is very essential that men should know about God because he's the creator of Heaven and Earth and then you should have an understanding why have God created you now why are you here on this planet Earth how do you involve yourself in this world okay there are prophecies and then those prophecies propheto need to be manifested uh we should know what are those professors concerning us let us Prophet otherwise our life will be in vain if we don't know that um we should always remind ourselves about prophecies that concerns us prophecies that are directed to us we should know that we have Dimensions we should know in which dimension is she now and we should also know that we have different bodies the body that we wear like the one I'm wearing now if I depart it does not mean that's the end of myself that will be a consolation to the family otherwise uh it will be a Perpetual wounds because they've lost their loved ones but in order to be in a right position they should know actually where she is right now together thing that we need to remind ourselves is the dispensations otherwise to worship God it's a good thing but you should know the dispensation that you are in because there is a dispensation that has got power within itself you know there was a woman who said to our Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ son of David please have mercy on me so she misplaced him wow Jesus the son of David and yet he was the son of man bullets he was in the dispensation of the son of man this is [Music] so when you call him and when you misplace him um uh that sort of uh slowed down your prayer knock okay slow down your anointing with this is because he recognized that you don't know him we are born when I'm born are we together it's okay so we also have to remind each other about the world and the Earth that we are in this planet Earth and then what is happening in this earth there is uh things that are happening which we call them the worldly things are we together then the last thing is we should not forget about the promises there are promises uh that pertains to us yes not the promises that are not directed to us I eat and peace a promise that is not directed to you will not benefit you it's 10 billion is it should be a promise that is yours and when you know that you have a promise that's why you direct all the power because in that promise it's your life but if you leave just the other people live just like any person almost then you are taking a wrong direction when you leave um you must know why are you living because what should you do because [Applause] you don't know where is the word directed in yourself there is this physical part which is a temporary part of this body which is temporal always and we should know that uh there is a spirit that gives lives to this body are we together okay and there is a part in this body but when God speaks the word is directed to a certain part it is the Bible says he he is knocking now he was rejected by the uh by the world lawyers God was rejected by The World Isn't it and then he was also rejected by the so-called Christians until now he decided to concentrate on the individuals now he concentrates on the individuals according to the dispensation [Applause] there's a time when this cat when God came as a human being let me start from the from from Heaven Again the Bible says God is a spirit those that worship Him will worship Him in truth now if God is a spirit so he decided now why is we so that you could speak and you'll hear him um but you cannot see the weed is that is why God decided to form a body remember God um are we too good amen now if he hasn't got no relatives now when he speaks he said let us make man what he ascends and who is he speaking to listen plural let us make man are we together amen but he was all by himself which means he was speaking to uh with his mind he was speaking by uh by himself he was speaking to himself with the children of which his children that were in his mind let us make man in our image why okay now if God is a spirit then he is the one that created his own son amen the Bible says in the beginning God has got no beginning God has no beginning [Music] that was when he is processing himself you cannot worship God unless you know him um and we cannot worship God is but you must know his process so that you should know the God you are worshiping when he said let us make man um then when the Bible says in the beginning was the wait no he started the first person that he could easy [Applause] now there is a physical sign and there is a supernatural son Jesus Jesus was a physicalist but when he was baptized yesterday we read the scriptures which is the Spirit came down to Jesus that made Jesus the Lord [Music] let all the house of Israel Israeli let all the house of Israel know in Israeli young that this Jesus Christ has made him um Lord and Christ one man because it's not the second person is called himself the Bible says without discrepancies without control became flesh he came in because now that is the greatest challenge ever inside when our Lord Jesus Christ said my father um people were looking for a second person that is why he said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation [Music] it's very difficult to say [Applause] so now if it says the kingdom of God um uh in the time that you are living in escatism the word of God is wherever the king is there is a throne is when the king moves um the throne also moves when God descends came into Jesus the Throne of God was in Jesus that's why he said if you don't believe that I am him you will die in your sins because God was in Jesus and that made Jesus the body where God dwells are we together now in in in in in in in bringing the words of consolation is to bring the The Throne of God in the heart of men only the word of God that will reveal himself only the word of God that will console you is that is the body of the word um now the body that will resurrect um is the body that received the Revelation um you know there is a wage there is a revealed weight amen the word is just a general word [Music] but the Revelation I mean the word that is revealed is the manifestation of the prophets look if the prophecy says Uma is propheto city a virgin shall conceive it's a prophecy it's Prophet uh foreign I was preaching at the funeral yoga I think come on yes and then I had only 10 minutes they gave me only 10 minutes to preach 10 minutes so I preached when the minutes was about to expire oh my little 10 minutes I preached two hours [Applause] so they gave me something like five minutes I've preached two hours so now here I believe the family they are Christians they are not against the preachers they are families that are very ancestrality of God we are not here to criticize anything so that we can all be convinced yes just nicely in a nice and informal way are we together now I was saying yeah the the the the Bible says uh uh invest22 and he said unto his disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man you shall not see it that was our Lord Jesus Christ speaking to his disciples remember he came as a son of Manchester United son of man is God in a human being in a human being that is what do they think I the son of man is you know the Christ God was a spirit then when he processed himself he became the witch the word is the pillar of fire is not so God is the pillar of fire Moses saw a pillar of fire um the angel of the Lord spoke from the pillars that's verse foreign different uh dispensations God can be an angel it can be called himself when he came as a man um so he came to act to express himself to manifest himself he wanted people wife together amen now he said unto them I am with you here I am God do you know that he says do you know that I am God he's saying that to his disciples who do you say that I the son of man am what is Christ hold it flesh and blood it's a revelation is [Applause] the Bible says ability there are those that are ordained for eternal life he revealed himself to those he himself look there was war in heaven you know that it was God himself fighting if I think the chair up who started mobilizing in heaven God became Michael um when God is fighting he becomes because if it's God um and defeat you you are going to say uh it's good the Bible says if I believe the devil recruited God remains the one that are predestinated [Music] [Applause] and they came and followed him [Applause] lives in a human being lives the spirit of God it does not dwell on the earth a human being stays there were anointed by the demons the Bible says thousands and thousands of churches God is not the author of confusion God will show you the right place what is the promise the promise is the changing of the body is actually born is waiting for the Lord everybody is waiting for the coming of the Lord are we together but the Bible says watch and pray he was reading that this morning but while you are watching um where would you be um where would you be fellowshipping it says accept the days be shortened um we have read the scriptures it says as it was also in the days of the son of man aims now he came as a son of man where is he was executed then from the one he went back remember that what happened is this on the day of Resurrection there were some sisters that saw him and then they wanted to touch him he said No don't touch me and then on that very same day in the evening Thomas came and touched him and put their fingers and the Bible says his spirit went back to God because when he was baptized the spirit went came to to Jesus and when he was supposed to be crucified that Spirit left him that's why in The Garden of kids he was praying and then his sweat became blood now that's one of the things that people get confused and say there's your God praying [Music] and he says Our Father who is in heaven [Music] what is he worshiping if you say this is god um there was an angel that was comforting him his soul went to hell why is right I mean and then what did he do in Hell Wednesday because when Peter said Thou Art the Christ um the kingdom of God was taken by Peter and then there were other kids that were remaining things the book of Hebrews chapter 2 says there were people that were afraid of death for the slave of death so what he did went to hell wire is in the book of Peter and what Inigo chapter 3 I think it's verse 19 first Peter Martin so he took the keys there was Paradise and high days the people in The Paradise communicate with the people tonight those in Hades were in tormented those in Paradise they were relaxed [Music] waiting for them and the Bible says we who are alive we are waiting for them let me tell you then then he took the keys then he went to paradise and move them out of paradise not easy and took them under the altar I thought we should know about Dimensions we are living here on Earth it's the athlete Dimension it is which is full of atomic bombs full of science but when you die you go to another Dimensions let me finish my story now he took them out of Paradise The Paradise Paradise was a communication with with with with high days but now there's no more Paradise because she took them out of paradise they are under the altar Banger on the sixth dimensions and then when you die um not knowing god go to the fifth dimensions that's where the devil is so when you live here on Earth no when you we are still living here on Earth you got an inspiration that comes from heaven or inspiration as we live here on Earth we are different people some worship Him indirectly [Applause] are we together so now when you die um you take your your line that is what we call it Dimensions my mind you kumbola everything was hidden young that is why here he says he says to them you will wish and his officer to see this day in other words you wish to see God in flesh and God descended from eternity came here on Earth is now in a human being I'm not confusing you God um the form of the revealed way yes [Applause] his word tonight when the time comes oh my God his soul um are we together his spirit will be in quotes anyway whether you died or whether normal drip will be normal even if you were eaten by direct yourself are we together so you will resurrect and we will see them that's what the Bible says we also change together what is going to make our bodies change remember as as I said the word is with God in you it's a potential God somebody said to me now you say God is in a man but the Bible says God will come from foreign you want bread and I gave I give you 50 rounds 50 Rand to go and buy bread potentially you have bread nothing I should do that so you say you can start singing and say I have pressure now the revealed weight is potentially the presence of God in a human ear are all together I mean that is the promise I just says you will desire to see God in a man they were with God then he said to them you will desire to see the son of man but you will not because you'll be living in another time now in this time Musa he was mediating he was saying I have died for them are my children he was mediating from the beginning of the first stage do you know that now we are zutimanji in which church age are we living in ABIA in any case let's leave it like that so what immediated his blood was washing us get into any parts that has got blood no this is how he watched us uh the word easy there was a time when Mary I'll call this katila Maria Merchant angels to me please make me away there was a time when Mary met an Angel um and then the angel said to him uh you are going to conceive us and Mary said I don't know any man um the angel said in English for God like he did to to to to Sarah but let me leave that one so Mary said okay fine let it be according to your weight um now the angel of the Lord is now the blood of that son was the blood of God now in explaining that is has got life in itself you know yourself if we have the parts of our body um if you break them down they become tissues um and those tissues become cell if you break them down those cells become gem cells those gem cells which have got life in itself there's a spirit in the gem cells when you've got cancer um what happened is this that attacks the spirit of your gems and once it's destroyed that it goes to the to the cells [Music] until it destroys the whole part of the body is now the doctors they could detect but they don't know that is [Music] cancer they tried to burn a demon a demon you cast it out in the name of it are we together that's why they say when you've got cancer uh life in itself in so that's the one now when he says he has redeemed us he was a mediator he stood for us are we together amen and then after that then that is the end now that's why that's why now he became the Son of God says uh uh to to the Lord Jesus Christ son of David Allah says now when you you you you administer to him and when you speak to him you must address him accordingly [Music] now when in the time that you are living he is now the son of man [Music] when he was with the disciples he was the son of man then he said to them foreign [Music] you must know that now he is now in you through it's a promise now if you don't know the promise of the time um it says it will be exactly like it was in the days of nowhere go and check the days of Noah and check the time that you are living those spirits that were in in the time of nowhere exactly you know are we together I mean now in the Book of Revelation is speaking about our time in Columbus 21 it says verse 21 sorry oh sorry chapter two it's October 3 chapter 3 verse 21 it says in verse 21 80 to him that overcome it not for anybody Amen to him that overcomes what is to overcome is it right okay all right let us close with this subject the overcome to him that overcome it what is to overcome is to recognize God in the time that you are living is then you will know him that overcome will I grant to sit with me in my Throne is your heart that I am in the father it was during the time of Jesus [Music] Tina now it's the word that overcomes [Music] to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even also I even I also if sorry even as I also overcame and I am set down with my father in his throne is to know where God is in your heart no God who is God what is the revealed ways [Applause] is God bless Hallelujah Wisconsin thank you again good evening father this
