Description:
Title: The Third Throne
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 11 June 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

Rev 3: 20 - 22    Rev 22: 11

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the third throne which is the final throne. 

In the Laodicean Church Age the Lord Jesus was rejected and he is no longer in the church. He is now in his final throne in the heart of man. 

Lot looked at Sodom and Gomorrah and saw that it was well watered and a place he can make settlement in. He saw it as a place where he could invest. But Abraham when he stood where he stood before the Lord and looked he saw a smoke of the city going up.

61-0101 -  Revelation, Chapter Four #2  -Par 229
 An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages (9 - The Laodicean Church Age)   -   It was a city of earthquakes, such earthquakes as finally destroyed it. This age will end in God shaking the whole world that has gone off to make love with the old harlot. Not only will world systems crumble, but the very earth will be shaken and then renovated for the millennial reign of Christ.
