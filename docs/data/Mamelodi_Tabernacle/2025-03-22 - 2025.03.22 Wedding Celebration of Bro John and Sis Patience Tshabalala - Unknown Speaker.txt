Please revelation 19 verse 17 verse 7 vers9 [Music] Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamp is come and his wife has made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he and he saith unto me, write, blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb. And he saith unto me, this are the true sayings sayings of God. We are going to have some before we can attend our precious name of our Lord. Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] You may take your seat. [Music] I'm not going to preach. I'm going to officiate. But before I do that, I'm going to give some few remarks concerning the marriage. Then after that I'm going to talk like a marriage council. Then after that Then I will ask you to stand marriage. Originally it was for parents. It belonged to parents just like in the beginning. called the father who was the father of Adam. He said, "My son, now it's not good for my son to be alone." [Music] It was not Adam who said, "I need somebody." that it was his father God who said it was not good for my [Music] son to be alone. Then God the father the father of Abraham he led Adam to a deep sleep. Then when slept He took one rib of Adam and made for Adam helpmate from Adam's sleep. After he had made her, he didn't breathe the breath of life into her. But after he had formed Adam in that formation, he bre the breath of life. Then Adam became a living soul. But after he had created this one, we don't hear the Bible saying he bre the breath of life into her because he took that part of Adam, a spiritual part of Adam and place it into this Then he took this one and brought her to Adam. And Adam said, "This is the bone of my bone and the flesh of my flesh." It was the father of Adam who looked for Adam's wife. Even Abraham because Abraham had the spirit of God, he knew that for her son to have a wife, he had to go and look for the wife for his son. Then he looked around around his servants And he called for the the trust with his servant. And he called that one. He was the one who was over all the servants. And he said to this one, he said, "Go and look for my son. go and look for the wife of my son. I trusted this one but this one will go and bring the right wife of my son. What I am saying I say originally marriage belong to the parent. You know when we buy cars, we buy them as they are perhap from Nissan or Toyota or whatever. But when you have brought it, you can try to modify it. When you modify it, it will be look better than the first one. But if you take it to the garage together with this one which which is not motivated, the the motif one will be lesser in price than the one who is not [Music] motif. The mar the marriages we have nowadays they are the modified [Music] marriages. They are not the original ones. That's why if it if it was the because now is the the young man who looks for the wife. No more the father who looks for the it was modified now. But when it was still in its original form, it was the father. The Bible here where I've read he said let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife had make herself ready. Why this wife has made herself ready? Before the wife can make herself ready, he had to make herself ready with the voice of the husband. That's why in our age, the prophet said the word of God now is in the bride knows how to do with the weight. The bride knows how to act according to the weight. The bride can prepare herself according to the [Music] weight because the bride now is married because the Bible says h those who are invited to the merit supper of the lamb [Music] They are blessed. They say the merry supper. Merry [Music] supper. Supper is at night. Supper will be after the marriage because the bride is now already married. He has to go to the merry supper where they are going to sit around the table and join themselves. Before they they can get there, they must have received the word of the husband here. When they have received the word of the husband, they had to be married by that husband. The father God is the one who looked for his son's wife. That's why his son was born. In fact, it was he himself. He came in a form of a son. So that this son must have a wife. For the son to have a wife, his his father had to come in flesh to look for the son's wife. That's why when Abraham was looking for his son's wife, he said, "The angel of the Lord will lead you." Because this is now a modified marriage. for a few minutes. I'm going to talk like a marriage counselor because the marriage marriage counselors and social workers came because of this motif marriages. Because originally we don't need a social work. We don't need a marriage counselor. But they've come because of this motif [Music] marriages. That's why I say now I'm not going to talk like a pastor. I'm going to talk like a marriage counselor. Marriage not marriage counselor but marriage officer. I want to be a marriage counselor for a short time. Marriage is a timeless [Music] institution. It is a beautiful journey of two [Music] lives woven together by the thread of the word of God. is a journey filled with moments that are sometimes [Music] difficult and sometimes easy is a journey where love is a compass. Let me repeat. Is a J where love is a compass and understanding is the map and trust is the guiding star. [Music] You must not forget I said I'm not talking like a pastor now. I'm talking like a marriage counselor. It is a it is a commitment between two people who promise to stand by each [Music] other through this live journey. I am not talking to the two now. I'm talking to the young men who have already married. I'm talking to them now. It's a journey. I said is a journey filled with moments that are sometimes difficult. When you get to that journey, you must know that I'm going to face some moments that will be sometimes difficult and sometimes easy. There will be happiness in the journey. There will be sadness in the journey. But is a journey. But you must know that love must be the compass and understanding must be the map and then trust must be the guiding star. There must be trust between the two. Are you listening to the marriage counselor? It is a commitment between the two [Music] people who promise to stand by each other. These two they have been standing by each other. They were they stand by each other for a long time. They are going to renew their vows and they will continue to stand by each other. Yes, they've seen some up and downs in their journey of marriage. They've already seen those. But they must go on. They must keep on going on. It is not for cowards. Marriage is not for cowards. Cowards must not marry. It is a celebration of partnership. [Music] and companionship and love story that should not [Music] end. It is the partnership and companionship. [Music] If that partnership and [Music] companionship, if it is not woven together by the word of God, it will never it will truly never it will truly end. It must be woven together by the word of God. It is it is a cornerstone that strengthened and increases families. It strengthens and it increases families. Those who were not families before, they are going to be families now. But it also can break families. It increases and creates the sense of belonging. [Music] offers a warm embrace for individuals to share their lives. There are certain signs that indicates that your marriage is in trouble. [Music] One sign, the first sign is communication breakdown. When communication breakdown [Music] starts, it shows that this marriage is going into trouble. Next point is the lack of intimacy. [Music] When the leg of intimacy comes, this this this this newborn is going to die. The third is infidelity. Infidelity. Invitality. When that comes know that you are leading into the a dish, constant fighting and so on and so addressing these challenges [Music] It requires the following but not limited to this. It requires patience, requests above challenges. When you when you are solving the above challenges I've said, it needs patience from both sides. It needs understanding both sides. It needs compromise. Both sides. You may stand up the you. The marriage officer is handing over to the pastor. Now the pastor is taking [Music] over. You also can stand up. I'm going to ask you this question. [Music] started this one. You must tell me your name and you must tell me your relationship with the one you are standing next to. [Music] My name is Finid and this is my sister. [Applause] Are you I'm still asking are you satisfied? [Music] The the unity of the two is all right from where they started to be together. And you are sure that they will go on the way they were. from he says I believe I and since they were together and we met everything has been well. Thank you Mercy. Can you tell me your name and relationship with the one standing next? I am the one standing next to me is my father. You are you are bringing your father to be united with this one. Yes. Are you satisfied? I am very happy men. You are fortunate. Because in these cases daughters they are not. Maybe you may take your seat. You can take your seat then go to sit wherever you want to go to sit so that I can remain with the um I'm not going to uh read the this vows the way they are here. [Music] I will require and will challenge you [Music] both as you surely answer at the day of [Music] judgment. When the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of you know any impediment, why should you not be lawfully joined? Why should you not be lawfully be rejoined and continue together? In this holy matrimony, do you now confess it? If there is any impedment, you must now confess it. For be it assured unto you, that any person that are joined otherwise than God's word does allow marriage is not lawful. That's why you have decided you that you should bring your marriage to God. Because marriage belongs to God. It does not belong to the magistrate. It does not belong to our wish doctors. But it belongs to God. You are blessed for doing that. as earth. But believing that you have truly considered this solemn obligation, you are about to [Music] assume that you have prepared to enter upon the same reverently, wisely, and in the fear of God. I shall propose to you the marriage covenant. We declare the same as you join your right hand. Come close together. Come together right together. Next, I will start with you. By the way, what is your name? Johnala. Start with you, John. John, will you continue to take this woman to be your lawful [Music] weather? And will you continue to live together in this holy state of [Music] matrimony? You promise to continue to love her, to honor her, and to cherish her in sickness, in health, in riches or poverty. Will do you promise that you will forsake all others and leave thee only unto her. As long as you both live. If it is so, say I win. [Music] I win. Yes, I will. [Applause] You have prove that you are not a coward. Will you sister? What is the name of sister? Patience. Patience. Sister patience. Sister patience. Sister patience, will you continue to take this man to be your lawful wed [Music] husband? And will you continue to live together with him in this holy matrimony? [Music] Do you promise to continue to love her, to love and honor him? You promise to cherish him in sickness and health, riches and poverty. Do you promise to continue and forsake all others and leave unto thee? only unto him. As long as you both [Music] live, if it is so, say, I will. I will do it. I like what you have done because you have decided to bring your marriage to God. Uh if there is some covenant sign tokens, will you bring them? Sir, [Music] thank you. God bless you. [Music] Stay anything inside. Nothing. [Music] Take this thing outside here. Put them on my Bible. All of them. [Music] Take them out. Put them in. [Music] Let's pray. My dear heavenly father, these are the tokens. Some people I used to take this thing and place them in their different fingers. But I believe these ones are placed in your weight. You are looking at them. Bless this token before they can place them in their fingers. I pray heavenly father in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You take the one for your wife and place it in her finger. And when you are placing them in in her finger, reassure her of your love. Reassure her that you still love her. After that long time, you are still for her. You can do it. [Music] Hey, [Music] wa Sheep. [Music] [Music] My love, the flower of my heart. [Music] I thank God by this day that I'm here in front of God. Exactly. If this marriage God is not there then all is in vain. Exactly. [Music] I met you before we were believers. But it was in vain because God was not there yet. [Music] But God has helped us all the way that we might come this morning in front of God. I'm inserting this ring. I'm saying let's continue. I still love you as you also respect me. We have been together for so long. We are from [Music] far. You have never surprised me. There might be mistake that I have done against [Music] you. You have been patient with me and forgiven me. I believe from your family. I never went there to report you for something. even on my side. Even if if ever there are mistakes that you have done, he never went to my family to ask for help. In all our mistakes, it was for us to sit and communicate together and forgive each other. I'm thankful for your long patience patient and your respect. I love you. [Music] It's the second pool. It's a second pool. I'm saying may our love continue. [Music] I [Music] believe as our pastor has just asked us that are we going to be patient with each other in everything that will happen is what I believe because I've already seen it in you. Amen. [Music] [Applause] [Music] The third. This is the third. I believe that God has blessed us. We have walked this journey for a long time. We have been from one church to another. [Music] But by the grace of God, he has shown us the place where he is. So I'm saying let's go on. God bless. It's not easy. But God has helped us to be where we are now. Amen. Because God is a place. Let's hold on. In one of the days, the word says in one of the days there was a king who called Aarez. [Music] Oh, he wanted to have a wife, King Aarus. The dms themselves were called from all the countries that was under him. They came together in the house of the king. The word says they were given ointments and they were supposed to make up themselves for six months. The next six months they were given perfumes so that they can be acceptable before the king. But there was a dark cell called the Bible says the one who looks after the maidens who was trusted by the king liked her. It says he took him and gave her a special room and gave her the required things to use. When the time for the dumpsters to contest before the king, they were coming and going, coming and going. There was no one that was accepted by the king because what the king required was not in them. [Music] The word says she was given all that was required because a guy knew the character that the king wanted when she move out to go and meet the king. Okay. Everyone was given what she required to meet the king. But when Esther went to meet the king, she required nothing save what she was given only by her God. Today we have our guy. Who is who has been given what the king requires. We are under the third pool ministry. [Music] We are under the seven seal ministry. Those things has been given to our own. It is the only way for us to meet our Christ. [Music] There's nothing else that Christ will require from us except what we are being given by our [Music] pastor. He's the one that we must hold on until we reach our destination. Thank you. God bless you. Sister, now is your time. It's your time to crown your husband. [Music] [Music] with this ring. I thank God I don't know where to start. Oh, I'm I'm happy for eternity. I'm very happy. All mine is well now. I'm in God now. It was troubling me. It was troubling me a lot.

We have these rings and God turn you back and waiting for this day. I don't know what to say. The God of Pastor Israel that he preaches, the God that pastor Maka that he preaches. Even now I'm so lively. I feel like I'm far away. I'm closer with God. My brother, I loved you. [Applause] Heaven and earth before heaven and earth was there.

Thank you, my brother. Place your hand. Come [Music] here. Put your hands here. [Music] My heavenly father, these are the two you knew from the foundation of the world that one day will be in this hall to join these two.

Greetings saints in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Is indeed a wonderful day. They've requested me to close the service in a word of prayer. But then right immediately immediately after closing with a word of prayer, I have few announcements. So I'm going to request your undivided attention for the announcement. So let us just close our eyes and pray. Let us pray. Our gracious eternal heavenly father, we like to thank you for your mercy and grace that has been with us since from the planning of the event. Heavenly Father, you have been with the family and heavenly father, here it is the manifestation of the desires you have put in their hearts. Heavenly Father, we thank you for leading them and making this event a success until this point. And Lord Almighty, we believe it will continue under your grace until to the end. Father, we thank you for the word that has been delivered. We thank you for the work of the Lord that has been done to reunite the two for them to continue in one unity. Father under the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. We thank you father as we commit this service into your hands as we have come to the end of it for now Lord Almighty we say let everything Father continue to be under your guidance heavenly father and the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
