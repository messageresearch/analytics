word we ask for blessings upon the reading of the word in Jesus Christ name amen as we turn to our books you canone or we are going to read the book of Psalms 90 ver1 to2 90 Psalms 90 Psalm brother we are going to read psalms 90 [Music] [Music] Generation [Music] generation [Music] okay and let's turn also to the Book of John chapter 14 verse1 verse one [Music] ver okay uh is that the one yes it is the verse one The Book of John John 14 verse1 okay if you can continue to verse two [Music] brother [Music] and and and lastly verse three and [Music] four three and four okay uh you may be seated God bless you H just for few minutes the Lord willing is just to look at our pleases as we read in the Book of Psalms uh uh I think we read that in [Music] English Lord thou has been our Dwelling Place in all generations our Dwelling Place in all generations now each and every person as as a human want must have a place and because we have seen even in the animal world that everything whether it's men or animal it is strong in its place amen amen so even we Christians each and every one of us is strong in his place that's why in worshiping we make sure that we find the right place because there are so many places tonight where people go for to worship but among all the places one has to find his [Music] place and as we will look in the Bible I used to go with a certain brother for hunting he's a hunter and I saw that the the animals are strong in their places then I to the Bible and I realize that man also is strong in his place we don't you don't just become a Christian but you become a placed Christian and I want to read in this book Fellowship by Redemption to John 14 now he says I have never believed that heaven was a place where there is a a bunch of buildings where there is a bunch of houses made with M now he's referring to where Jesus says I'm going to prepare you to prepare a place for you and brother b as you have read you know this uh part here he is showing us uh what kind of a place the Lord was talking and uh he's going to show that if you have a place in heaven then you have a place here in the body of Christ because the prophet says before God can show something on Earth he shows it in heaven because when he he God wanted to reflect to be reflected now when he made a man he made a man so that men can reflect as he says in the book count down count down he says when God created things uh he says that everything on on Earth reflects Heaven because you see that everything is struggling for [Music] life it's because that there is life that it's reflected from so says a tree is traving because there is a tree now in the Garden of Eden this tree was perfect now struggling because in the New Jerusalem there is a tree and the man also in the Garden of Eden was H there was no disease there was no sin that's why now he is struggling today because in the New Jerusalem he is perfect eternally now my Prophet says because there is life somewhere and I believe that when God made men he started reflecting the smaller things amen amen so he made the trees then he made men and the last thing that ever come from the earth in the form of creation was man nothing higher nothing higher ever come came because why he's referring to men it was a perfect reflection of the highest in heaven so man is the perfect reflection of the highest in heaven that's why you know the last the end time message speaks of God and [Applause] man and to bring the whole thing back it has to come back to God and Men that's why brother says the original the second Adam has come to take the second the first one failed now he he he speaks of the second Adam Jesus Christ and he says he Bright Now can never fail because he says the second second is the word now says the also of is the now this the husband and wife canot say and because with the [Music] first the prophet says the word God gave them never found a place that's why they fell he says that word found place in Mary and It produced a son and now reading here now he says man was the highest the perfect reflection of the highest in heaven which God is a man you see God said let us make men in our image okay now he says which God is is a man God which is a man all right and I will noty that we are reflecting the almighty [Applause] God amen amen so now I I I'm trying to follow something here now God is a man which is God's place we even we read even yesterday in our book that God made a place in a man for himself Andy because now we are in another tacle if I got I've got the book here I will stra read it you know we are trying to find ourselves we are trying to know ourselves am so that we can walk knowing who and I read here where he says the little compartment in the heart of men God made that in there for himself maybe let me just talk and and not preach the compartment in the heart of men which we call the soul God made that in there for himself that mean that is his place that's that is his control room and he says there to control you then the prophet says that is his place that is God's place now if you want to talk to somebody it's always better to go and meet him in his place amen if you want to make your point clear go to the person's Place amen so he says this compartment in the heart of men is God's place that's where he sends his messages from which is the control [Applause] room nowday you will only hear the word of God from the men it will prove itself in the I'm trying to say to you even the Jews they missed God because when God was a man they were looking up to heaven so they couldn't find him because you need to meet him in his place you need to come to temps and come to where he is so we have learned today to meet God in his place and that place is also my [Music] place because the secret is God and men in a [Music] place brother one time I don't know whether was with us now he he says to me with some other brothers he says you know brother I asked God I said to God I want to see you and then he says after that I saw you the pastor now he God said oh you want to see me and he says then he had a like a a dream a vision dream he doesn't understand then he saw he says I then I saw you the pastor [Music] so that was the answer from you want to see me then I see then I saw the pastor what does that mean God is saying to him look there okay I will read something here while reading here brother he says the Holy Spirit spoke to him and he said if you can get this people to believe [Music] you if you can get this people to believe you amen now this is what Jesus says here believe in God also now if they believe in God then God is a the Lord Jesus says believe in God believe so in the manifestation amen because if believe God God is a spirit then it will bring you down to the Manifest it is God now amen so believe in God believe also in me says the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ so you don't believe in two Gods you believe in God God is a spirit believe also in the second in the second you know you know he he comes in three stages believe in God and now when God is in a man believe in the second stage amen that means believe God where he is amen am and if he is in heaven you believe God in heaven if Jesus says God is in me believe God where he is amen that's how you find him and you become [Music] aced because you believe him where he is so now he says brother says to a person here do you believe me to go to be God's [Music] Prophet amen he says because God says if you can cause them to believe you that means believing God me God's Prophet because God speaks to you through me your Prophet I'm talking about so it is to find God where he is now Moses one time he said to God Show Me Your Glory Show Me Your Glory and what God did he said I will I will hide I'll make you to stand on a rock then you shall see me as I pass by amen now because he wants to see the glory of God brother as he says in the Bible he saw the heart of men because he wants to see the glory of God then he sees part of men so now now he say here coming down this the Samaritan woman if I've got the book here speaks of this women here from Samaritan and uh he says this woman let me read it this little woman her first life was up here her first life was here a prostitute amen amen so she was mixed up now when Jesus came the priest looked at him and they called him a [Music] devil but this little woman she had nothing she was dty and filthy a [Music] prostitute but not his way down in her she's got representation amen and then she was looking for this to be made flesh because that that thing must come to a fulfillment a manifestation so she was waiting looking for it to be made flesh because she says we know that Messiah comeing and when he come he will tell us all things he was wait she was waiting for that to be made flesh because it couldn't help her when it was just the word she had to wait until that word was made flesh and when the was made then she was closer closer to God and she speak with him in his place you know the people in the olden [Music] days used to be represented by the high priest in the ho the high priest supposed to walk and go into the and God spoke to him so God was in that place would come in that place and the high priest has to come with the names of the children of Israel before the Lord there in the holy of H and when [Music] Moses God said to Moses let them make me an [Applause] ark and put upon the ark the seat of mercy and facing one another and I will speak to you from off the amen so now Moses had to go there before the AR amen amen now in the heart [Music] of
