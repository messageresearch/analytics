Description:
Title: The White stone Interpretation
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on the 18 February 2024.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Revelation 2:17

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the interpretation of the White Stone.
The people who have a new name are not like any other person, because they have a new name and have received a white stone. They are a reflection of God. 

The bride of Christ is above all the dimensions. Those who are going into rapture are already in a certain position, and not everyone will be going into the rapture. 

The dimension of God is the 7th dimension that is where God is operating in. The people who will be going into the rapture they are found in a pyramid. 
The seed of God today is not part of the worldly things. If you are predestinated you can’t be ancestral because you are coming from God. 

The Spirit of God cannot dwell in another person, God dwells in his place, which is the Soul. If God is not in your Soul you cannot do anything. Everything is known by its nature. 

When you have the White stone you are an interpretation. A Christian cannot hate, to hate is of the devil.
When God remembers the Covenant he sent Moses, when God remembers the Covenant he sent Elijah the prophet. 

In the 4th dimension, they do not hear the Lord, the rapture is not coming for those people. The people in the 4th dimension are programed. God is in the 7th Dimension. The person who is in Christ resembles Christ. To be taken away you need to please God. 

A Christian is a person who is born again and has received the message.  A Christian is someone who fears God, you can’t mix God with the world. 
The real revelation of the Word of God is when the prophecy is fulfilled. 

The Pastor quoted the following spoken words:
63-0324E - The Seventh Seal par 331, 394 and 404
62-1104M - Blasphemous Names Par 71

just sang a song that says this is the altar of judgment in the last days father after sending your message you gave us a pastor that is standing before us when you sent us a message through your Prophet through your seven Angel messenger many people in those days they didn't understand what was happening but because God you are your own interpreter you the one who comes every day and teach us

ask all this blessing in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen [Applause] amen all right amen let's read uh the scripture with brother Gabon here Revelation 2 verse1 17 17 he that he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to it of the Hidden man and will give him a white stone and in that stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen amen amen you may be seated God bless you uh myself I won't be long and so uh this is the word uh a quotation given to me by brother gabri is willing to come again he says if we can summon him any time uh he will Avail himself amen okay amen H given a he will be given a new amen all right amen say it brother and will give him a white stone and in that stone a new name written amen am okay amen given a white stone and in that name a new name I believe that the people who have now new names are not like everybody you see because they've got a new and they have received White [Music] amen and we believe that this white stone uh with a new name it is a reflection so these people they have already received if we we were to talk about dimensions and we will you'll realize that the bride of Christ now uh is above all [Music] Dimensions but we'll come to that if you were to look for the people that are going in the rupture I can we can look at the dimensions should you find one will come with that because not everybody is going in the rupture those that are going in the Rapture they are already amen amen in a certain place uh we have which one is God's Dimension Dimension oh the seven all right amen and if you are found to be reciting in some other dimensions will you be are you going to be taken up because you are not not in God's Dimension God operates in the you say the seven yes now let's look at it God operates in which dimension okay amen now that's why we are if you want to to know the people in the position the people are found in you look at the dimensions amen amen and the dimension the dimension uh where you find the the people who are going in the rupture will be taken from a certain Dimension because they are already [Music] reciting in a certain Dimension so that they are ready to be taken now I'm going to read this thing uh it says I quote do you remember the pyramid of White Rock a pyramid pyramid you know pyramid pyramid is something where uh God used this pyramids a set of a place let me look at one here the pyramid pyramid you know I've checked this way and that way the seventh man was responsible for this structure the pyramid amen that's why all the people that are going in the rupture you you find them I'll show you in which pyramid okay amen well there's some people that are talking about the rupture now it's not just something to talk about but it's something one finds himself having already entered in that Supernatural Zone oh H to be taken away in the twinkling of an eye because it says uh we have had Apollos and what else but none of them is faster than the Rapture in a twinkling of an eye and we look around and have seen all the events that the Lord has spoken of when he was asked about the end of the world and uh he spoke about the things that I'm seeing every day and that it shall be like in the days of Lord in the days of Noah all right amen but in in those days there was a a seed the seed of God and this seed of God was not part of those events the chosen ones now you you'll realize that the seed of God today is not part amen uh they don't dance for the worldly sounds and all that they are special people I'm trying to read something here and before we will come to the this Dimensions you know we have read something when the prophet said he spoke of the dimensions I don't know if you know what a dimension is now there are people uh residing in some Dimensions or a dimension already they are locked in there they don't even hear the word of God because they don't really uh operate or live they don't leave in the dimension of God the seventh seal all right am now let me read this uh Enoch Enoch and notice in the Zodiac it starts off with [Music] vision the last thing in the zodiac is Leo the Lion the first coming of Christ through the vision and the second coming and it says now that's Leo the Lion of the tribe of Judah amen all right amen now let's look at this I have took down some few things here the people who will receive a new [Music] name God won't call you by your Earthly old name why because that name isly and maybe you were named after your [Music] grandmother and that's why people are so much ancestral uh there this word predestination if you are predestinated you can be [Music] ancestral because you don't come from Goos and and you come from God you came from go so you can be ancestral if you are from [Applause] God uh you you look at the people today their nature you can look at a person and realize that this person has got something a certain Spirit and the spirit of God cannot dwell in another Spirit God predestinated you and uh in order to find he made himself a place amen a Dwelling Place in you amen that place is called the soul amen and even this morning if God is not in your soul you can do anything you can even defy him because he is not in his place he is not there there's only two nature either it's of God or Satan and uh the tree is known by its okay every tree is known by its fruit you don't need to fasten I with a tree you just wait for the nature of that tree amen amen when it's summer when it has a a nature a nature that cannot be changed you know you find the people with a nature you can change really you know when God comes the first thing to do for God to dwell in somebody's heart he must be changed first otherwise if a person if God don't find a place in a person that person will still remain worldly amen the nature one change because in him is the nature of the world but that person can go to church and come to church and also claim to be a child of God worship and all that but the nature amen am everything is known by its nature amen amen if somebody says message believe the message he said okay let's see the nature now you look at the nature because you can't worship God and Satan it is impossible so that's why the Rapture will it's only few people that are going in the rupture but let us read something here and close the service uh here we've been watching young people of today yeah only few are Christians very few young people of today all right amen now let's read this as I say I I I won't be long uh I've I've got something here The White Rock interpretation [Music] many a [Music] time people don't understand what is a title now I'm say the White Rock interpretation White Rock interpretation amen now everything today is interpreted I can ask you how do you interpret that thing how do you interpret no because men was made to be an interpretation either of the word of God or otherwise if you are a Christian you are an [Music] interpretation because good works are found in you until Paul said you are written epistle read of all [Music] Paul say so now if you are here and you are a Christian that means you are a written okay amen I was talking to another young man I said you know sometimes you can young men in families young women like as I'm here everybody knows I'm here and from here the person I meet I will say hey the Lord has blessed us today but you find some young people old as [Music] well sometimes you don't see them maybe for the whole day but the time you they arrive back from where they were you'll be listening to here they greeting you where I come from St say hey we're busy with the white stone but when they come in they shall say how are you hey have you cooked what what have you cooked now you will not tell you where he's coming from because where he's coming he not coming from God he is actually coming from things mhm amen do you call that Christianity no he's not a Christian H there was a song going like this I I met a preacher then we spoke but as soon as he turned away his back from me he scandalized to my name all right amen people hate us so much because some people scandalize our names okay but the Christian cannot hate that is not a Christian nature to hate is of the devil the Bible says he who hates his brother is like amen amen no no he said this this and this okay amen uh we we rejoice and enjoy the word of God for the word of God speaks of us and speak to us amen amen if somebody says is this is what is that's why you don't hear me throwing stones and amen even the Lord Jesus Christ they said they call him you've never heard him say [Music] same when they were judging they judged him he said father forgive them they don't know what they do amen he was feeling P that they don't know what they're doing now let's read this H you will receive a new name what did it say a new with a new name a rock okay Amen brother read it again I I want to look at something here he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit sayth unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to it of the Hidden Manner and I will give him a white stone and in that stone a new name written amen which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen he that has and yeah not this one because I was reading where the Prophet says he speaks of your theop he says those seven colors of the rainbow which was the Fountain of spirit condescended into a theop meaning if you can't receive or understand you can't receive uh you can't receive the seals seven things if you are not made of seven now the soul is made of seven which the seven rainbow colors that's God we'll read it God came from this Fountain of seven the rainbow the token of your Covenant the rainbow now not this rainbow you see but the rainbow of a spirit now you cannot receive seven unless there is seven in you now your soul is if it is from God it is seven that's why the message comes in seven seven Church ages s churches seven se you see to serve you your soul which is made of seven it is served by God it's 7 to7 coming short of that you can do anything there are people living here that can do anything they can come to church and worship and do that after that they go to the world and do anything amen amen because God has selected some Souls you are blessed with a soul am that Soul coming from the Fountain of Life seven colors of the rainbow you've seen it in the Bible uh it was the token of the Covenant when he said I I shall set up a B in the sky why instead of God looking at [Music] you he looks at the B then when when Israel was in Exile the Bible says God remember his Covenant was made of seven when he remembered the Covenant he sent Moses when he remembered the Covenant he sent Elijah the prophet knowing that he has the Covenant people they are not church goers they are called that's why they don't belong to the churches for God said to them behold I will send you Elijah the prophet he shall turn the hearts of the children to their fathers and brother Bram says to their pental fathers in the times of Paul Peter and in those in that time the church started there 12 Apostles but when he comes to the Gentiles it speaks of seven Church ages okay amen now I will send you Elijah he shall turn the hearts of the children back the prophet says back to their Pentecost amen amen because on the on Pentecost they conceed amen amen and now and gave [Music] birth when they gave birth here we have seven Church ages that's why Israel Moses and Elijah will appear there but uh he says it says it is Elijah this Elijah is coming is the same Elijah but he says he will come off off of the Gentile church but there for the Jews he will be Elijah from off because that is the Spirit uh There Was Elijah elah and then came elishah El and the spirit of elishah also the spirit of Elijah came to anointed elij and John the Baptist he came in the spirit of Elijah that's why uh he was responsible for introducing the Messiah and that spirit in the last days came also to forun which coming you don't know amen okay now the sister say the second coming mhm amen it must be the spirit of Elijah for the first coming of the Messiah and for the second coming is the spirit of Elijah amenu amen amen for elected people all right amen now let me show you something if Elijah did not speak there is where you know I I don't have it today here but brother Bram spoke of the dimension then it says he says of those Dimensions uh he mentioned something you know which dimension that that it shows people colors which dimension the fourth all right amen he says it choose it choose things it's radio all that is the fourth and God dwells in seven now the fourth dimension uh you find some Spirits residing in this fourth dimension they do not hear God at all they can't their Spirit are fourth dimension you can preach until you turn blue never change them they won't change now the Rapture is not coming to pick up the fourth dimension di that's not the Realms of the supernat it's for the people who love the world the things of the world and what the Bible says they will be lovers of themselves this that's why Paul says we preach these things to the perfect then the prophet of God tells you a perfect man or a woman who has eternal [Music] life it says he is perfect all right amen he is ruled by the spirit of God all right amen now I'll tell you something now this is the fourth dimension Dimension and uh we read that uh the fourth dimension you find the people where it says the people are programmed in the fourth dimension but the children of God are the which dimension the seven amen all right that's the differ only few people are goingup very few because I I will not go in the Rapture because I worship here in m I go in the Rapture because I worship in [Music] Christ all right amen is when we come together but theal recite in the fourth dimension and the Seven Dimension Spirits or souls are the people who are in in Christ amen a person who is in Christ resembles [Music] Christ amen amen in his works to please [Music] God Enoch the seventh man walked with God I'll tell you that should like the Lord Jesus if he can appear here you'll see things all right amen what is to walk with God if like as we usually say we are on the runway meaning like Enoch the Bible says was he was the seventh he walked with God and he was not it says why because he pleased God amen amen right amen he pleased God and then God took God was so pleased you know when God is pleased there will be RT amen he become so pleased until he will just take amen M amen so for to be taken away you've got to please God amen amen if you like if you Ser under the fourth dimension you'll only please the fourth dimension people but amen I see the people who used to recite and say they are children of God but you see them today yeah pleasing the world they want to be seen of the world all right amen you know Enoch en working with God I let me say to you if you have decided to walk with God do you think you can please God by a hairy no no or yeah let me I'm I'm talking now there are people here the Bible says they will receive a white stone a white stone that's why I have put here as my yes amen the white the white Rock interpretation uh BR where where is that uh what do you call this SL all right amen can you see that no yeah it's just a sketch there sketch because let me read it and we close the Lord willing the white stone if you are here you are a Christian you have sh the things of the world to follow Christ the Bible says you have a white oh yeah here we are amen now in the pyramid I quote say is this the time is this the time it speaks of this when the prophet went West you know in the Bible man the Garden of Eden was East now every time he meets an angel he will say I went [Music] West to meet an angel and those angels He says they were coming east and picked him up amen amen Eastward so for the message of the seals he went West to [Music] connect and back again that's why you find the people in the same what we call the message but are not the same some received him when he returned now when he return East he says I went to connect I went West to connect with the Angel's [Music] message okay amen the angels that the angel it is an angel he went to connect with this one Angels Angel [Music] message you know there's an angel that flew to him now he went Westward to connect with the angels and came back to reveal it came back East amen all right amen you know you have East you have West all all this amen east west sometimes we know the people like you say these are from East these are from and you realize that the people from amen amen are not in harmony with the people from influence right if you take Lucifer Lucifer I I'll tell you something does this sister I was with the brothers I think I mentioned this last she was sent to get a ky maybe she's here I want her to give that testimony she was sent to my house house looking for a key I don't know who was there with me okay the ERS here were there she look at the sofa and say oh that key was here and she continue to say uh she is sent for the key because I realized when when she started to search amen amen running her hand behind the S here thinking that the key has fallen into on the back [Music] side serious serious then because she says when I asked which key she said they want to open because there's some spirits logged in it was not the first time the first time she came I don't know if brother can recall yes so he can't recall he's out just oh he's out she came there the same person I was with brother we were at the wedding was it a wedding in a certain room prepared for their Elders for lunch she came in there and she was serious sat down and saidu I am here sent to ask for the key I said which key I said they want to unlock because they are spirits now there was a brother here who used to call him uh that brother from zound he used to walk around here sound gospel sound goel and he said to me the Bible speaks of an angel with a key and but then he Contin to say something which I cannot explain and not once and he repeated the same thing to another brother or brothers that angel with a key then the brothers went toland [Music] uh not yeah I mean no no no no okay because I will confuse you if I say cab amen and

prophecy as je has saidah that is the real word of God a prophecy being fulfilled the word of God the real word of God the real revelation of the word of God is when a prophecy is fulfilled P heart amen amen amen people read the Bible but when he was born the prophecy came Isaiah spoke a son is born unto us that was the prophecy now those who knew about the prophecy They Came To Worship some came with gifts appropriate gifts they followed the prophecy that the son is born on the day of Pentecost Peter said these people are not drunk with new wife a prophecy being fulfilled amen amen you know that's why it was not from the bible school it was from the prophet from God he said behold in the last days I will pour out of my spirit then when it was fulfilled Peter received it and said
