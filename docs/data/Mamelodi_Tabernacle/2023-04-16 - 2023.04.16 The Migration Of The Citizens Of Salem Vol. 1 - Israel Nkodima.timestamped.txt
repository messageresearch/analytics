[7:47] flying up when he's actually flying down
[7:49] if he goes by his senses and feelings he

[7:54] if he will ignore his feelings and focus
[7:58] only on the instrument panel he will
[8:01] learn safely to fly again

[8:20] urim and famine in this day the written
[8:23] bible and the message with an open book

[19:01] the children they were wondering
[19:08] all right
[19:11] um
[19:12] I don't know whether it is
[19:14] understandable yeah
[19:19] when the spirit of the Lord puts you
[19:22] there
[19:27] and then you are trying to pull back
[19:29] even there
[19:31] their cheers
[19:40] because it puts you somewhere
[19:44] and somebody who is not there with you
[19:48] he will never understand

[28:34] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[28:37] go out into a place which he should
[28:40] after receive for an inheritance obeyed
[28:44] and he went out not knowing whether he
[28:47] went
[28:48] by faith he saw John in the land of
[28:51] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[28:55] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[28:58] Heirs with him of the same promise
[29:01] for he looked for a city which had
[29:03] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[29:06] God
[29:07] through faith also Sarah her
[29:10] self-received strength to conceive sin
[29:12] and was delivered of a child when she
[29:15] was past age because she judged him
[29:18] faithful who had promised
[29:20] therefore
[29:22] therefore sprung there even of one and
[29:26] him as good as did so many as the stars
[29:31] of the sky in multitude and as the
[29:34] sandwich is by the seashore innumerable
[29:38] this all died in faith not having
[29:41] received the promises but having seen
[29:44] them are far off and were persuaded of
[29:49] them and embrace them and confess that
[29:52] they were strangers and pilgrims of the
[29:55] Earth
[29:55] for they that say such things did live
[29:59] plainly that they seek a country
[30:01] and truly if they had been mindful of
[30:05] that country from whence they came out
[30:08] they might have had opportunity to have
[30:11] returned but now they desire a better
[30:15] account that is a heaven wherefore God

[1:18:58] as a citizen
[1:19:05] when we arrived at the airport
[1:19:09] Airport

[1:20:04] yes
[1:20:06] differences

[1:20:17] and for the foreign
[1:20:21] [Music]
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:49] [Applause]
[1:20:51] when he was rejected by the juice
[1:21:00] and it is in the book here
[1:21:06] that's why as the price
[1:21:08] you are a citizen
[1:21:13] amen now when we arrived even this time
[1:21:19] you you can see
[1:21:24] for the citizens
[1:21:30] we've got to produce some documents
[1:21:34] we are not citizens
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:52] some others they come
[1:21:55] they are told that
[1:21:56] you have never paid tail to melchized
[1:22:04] you're not a citizen
[1:22:07] there's difference between a visitor and
[1:22:10] a citizen
[1:22:14] even treatment of this particular people
[1:22:19] is different
[1:22:24] the way God treated
[1:22:27] Abraham
[1:22:30] was not the same way it is a funny
[1:22:35] well when he treated somebody
[1:22:40] you watch when God treated David
[1:22:46] it was not the same way
[1:22:49] somebody could could do something
[1:22:54] and in some ways
[1:22:57] even David
[1:23:00] amen amen but that one will pay for it
[1:23:07] amen
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:16] you watch although God is Not Like Us
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:23:25] if you come to a family
[1:23:28] and there's some visitors
[1:23:32] and their children
[1:23:43] whether the
[1:23:46] the kind of family
[1:23:50] how they treat their visitors
[1:23:54] but while we are there you can see when
[1:23:57] homo were born no man why this one is
[1:24:00] treated like this and that one is
[1:24:13] also so that I can see
[1:24:16] um
[1:24:23] but in Christ
[1:24:25] is different if upon
[1:24:28] the Bible says
[1:24:37] hey you can't say that to some people
[1:24:39] because
[1:24:44] even when he owes me
[1:24:53] and the Bible yeah
[1:24:57] who has hurt when it says
[1:25:01] he who hates his brothers
[1:25:06] compared with
[1:25:12] who mad at his
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:21] but listen get a challenge
[1:25:25] we are listening amen
[1:25:28] but still

[1:25:52] and if it is not Divine now
[1:25:57] that same person
[1:25:59] can act like an animal
[1:26:07] so that's why
[1:26:08] foreign
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:43] I can talk
[1:26:44] speak talk about liars
[1:26:48] about
[1:26:54] it and even you can even say today the
[1:26:58] pastor really spoke about it
[1:27:00] it's just us people we are really a
[1:27:04] fghani is
[1:27:06] you are failing because you don't have
[1:27:09] it it's not in you

[1:53:23] you amen
[1:53:33] with Abraham Abraham you know God loves
[1:53:37] to have people like him
[1:53:41] God wants to make us into his own
[1:53:44] fashion
[1:53:48] that's right he wanted David
[1:53:52] people like Abraham
[1:53:56] God loved him so much
[1:54:06] I mean I mean no that means if you are a
[1:54:10] child of Abraham
