Dear God, as we are gathering tonight in this all, oh Lord, with our hearts broken and bleeding, realizing, oh Lord, there is someone who should have be here with us and he's not here. Oh Lord, this is a big vacuum that he has left. We cannot feel his presence physically, but we know that spiritually he's still here with us. Lord, even if he's not here physically, but we come here to celebrate his life, to remember that your servant was a soldier and he fought the battle and he winded. Yes, Lord. We know that he has finished his mission here on earth and is no more this side of eternity with us. But he is in that other side, oh Lord. And we know that he still lives because the Christian cannot die. His spirit and his legacy still live among us. Oh Lord, he was an example for us, oh Lord, of humility, of power, and he is still an example for us, oh Lord, because we are just following the footstep on the sand of time. I we know that. Oh Lord is now resting. We know that our Lord is no more suffering in his blood in his sh in his shame. We know our Lord is not in rest in peace. And we come here to remember what he has during his trip here on earth. And we come here to remember with our speeches, our tributes and everything. And songs that he was here among us and uh he left a good examples for all the ministers because even if he's not here physically but his ministry and the gifts that was in his body impacted so many lives not here only in South Africa but all over the world and in Africa. The ministry of that humble man, not simple a a man of God, but a man sent from God was impacted many of us. Oh Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you for pastor Israel Kodima. We thank you for his life. We thank you for his big ministry. We thank you for the gift that he has put in his life. We thank you for his humility, his love and how he was a simple among us. Oh Lord, he was a help for every one of us Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus, oh Lord, we pray that you may give us a spirit, the spirit of love, a spirit of unity. We need you now more than ever. Lord, we need you among us, oh Lord. Take over all of this this hole and control our spirits and everything that will be done here. We need the love that we seen in his life. We need the spirit of unity. Oh Lord, we need you in among us. We need the Holy Ghost to take over because it was not a man that was guiding us, but it was Elohim himself veiled in the human flesh to guide his church and to guide his bride. Jesus Christ, we commit everything unto your hands. We commit the program unto your hands. And the man, the pastor Madiva, who is the director of the program, we commit him also unto your hands. And the songs and everything begin with us, oh Lord, as Alpha and uh go to the end with us as omega because we ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

Oh, we'll be walking. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, when I come to [music] the river of [music] when the last All sorrows have blown all [music] the [singing] you waiting to [music] smell the way. I [singing and music] want to cross Jordan alone. [music and singing] I won't help to cross [music and singing] your hand alone. Jesus [music and singing] died all my sins to [music] when the darkness I see. He'll be waiting [singing and music] for me. I will help [music] to cross Jordan Lord. Often times [music and singing] I am weary and tr when it seems [music] that my friends have [singing] allowed. [music] sword [music] the ch [music] and make my heart. [singing] I want her to cross and I [music] will give [music] to Jordan alone. Jesus [music and singing] died all my sins through. [music] When the darkness I see, he'll be [music and singing] waiting for me. I won't have to close [music and singing] your head alone. I [singing] want I [music] want to cross your head alone. [music] Jesus [singing] died all my sins to atone. [music] In the darkness [music] I see, he'll be waiting [music and singing] for me.

[music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; It's not working. All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh the next item on the program, [music] it will be a speech by the family representative is brother [music] Masumba. But be as he comes to the four, I want us to ask all the pastors that are here, anyone that is a pastor, [singing] if you can all stand [music] to your feet, so that the whole congregation can welcome you with a round of applause. Let's have all the pastors standing on their feet. [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless your pastors. Pastor [music] had such a high regard for pastors as you take your seats. As brother Masa as he comes to the four. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; And then as he's coming, I'm going to request the speakers just to be conscious of time and we want the program to be orderly. I believe that we all know that Pastor Gurimo was a man that loved order. I remember there was a time We were at a certain place, I won't mention the name and we were having a convention and then we were booked into a guest house as pastors and then in the morning was moving from room to room not realizing that he was making an inspection in Then he came to my room. Luckily, I had made up my bed. &gt;&gt; And then he walked in &gt;&gt; and he says, "And those other men, they did not make they did not make their beds." &gt;&gt; It says, "Speak to them so that they make up their beds." It says, "Because if we don't make up our beds, this guest house will think that we are disorderly." then they will not believe our gospel if we are disorderly. So tonight I expect us to be orderly as we reflect on the life of this giant of faith. God bless you. And immediately after brother Masuma after he has made his speech we are going to requested the Switzerland believers just to join brother and we're going to sing the song that pastor loved. God bless you. Across the bridge, [singing] [music] there's no more sorrow. [music] Across the bridge, [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Uh this is a song that our pastor He really loved. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we as the masugas and the mabas, we were really blessed, to have a father, to have a grandfather, to have a pastor, to have a god in a man. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. to us. &gt;&gt; He was a he was a father. He was a pastor. &gt;&gt; We would at times when we would love to have a conversation with him about the family matters. He would accommodate us as much as things he also accommodate us. &gt;&gt; Really we were blessed. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now I was so blessed especially on my side because if we lay next to the pastor while I was a young boy being a man like this is because of his teachings. I've been with him several times while we still fellowshipping at the school at the school name &gt;&gt; and then we move also to in this ministry &gt;&gt; with him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. And there's about almost 45 years in this ministry working with him &gt;&gt; up until God remembers him and I'm going to continue walk &gt;&gt; where he taught me to walk. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then another thing when we start school, we we were the ones responsible for starting. We the mafiris. I think they know about it because we would sing together with singing. And then as as time goes on, we moved. and I was a chorus leader there at the same time at the same time. [music] So it shows us my pastor all the way even in the family they know it very well. funeral Sundays &gt;&gt; that when there's funerals over the weekends on Saturdays to come they know that because it's God first. So that's how he has taught us that God come first [music] and these other things they shall follow. So we as the family, we want to thank the Lord with such a precious gift within the family, &gt;&gt; the one that God gave us in the family. So we'll keep on going forward until we meet him. God bless. God bless you. sland believers as they come with brother and just sing. Amen. Amen. One, two. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; One, two, &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Sural.

[music] You know when we were in the hospital and the doctor came and told us uh we've done the best that we can do and he said you can speak to the pastor. He said you can speak to the pastor. H may not respond. Then I stood next to his bed and I said, "Pastor Israel, your sermons prepared us for this moment and we are not afraid." Then I saw him nodding and I realized that he knew what was happening. So I can tell you this gospel works. Pastor is a young man. Pastor is a young man where he is. He is in a new body. Amen. Amen. Let us invite [music] the speech by the chairperson of the mud board. It will be brother immediately after him. It will be worship team. They were supposed to sing we remain victorious.

The chairperson of the board of mood. I took over from when the old man says I served a long time under our pastor Israelima called now we nominated and elected then I became [music] the chairperson then he said This bait goes to you from now going forward, please mentor me. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I even said to him, even if I mess up, it's your mess. Wow. So we continue like that and we have seen God doing great things under the leadership of our pastor Israel. We are honoring him today. So saints we we we gather with set heart today but also with hope as the chairperson of this port of Maloney speak for all of us our pastor as well we have lost a great man indeed. He was not an ordinary He was a supernatural. I'm so touched this evening because what I see is what he told me since he started sick until he depart. I was always there. Not some days. Every day I was with the pastor every day. &gt;&gt; He was our shepherd. He loved us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He taught us God's word. He prayed with us and he helped us in good times and hard time. He was a great man indeed. This life shows us how to follow Christ. Yes, we cry. We miss him. He He was very much aware as well. He was very much as aware as well. But the Bible says, "Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted." Amen. Amen. Pastor will tell us that do not say sad. &gt;&gt; Christ has won over death. &gt;&gt; And our pastor now is in the sixth dimension where he was always telling us about and this this God hold each other. Move forward. Let us leave the faith of our pastor. &gt;&gt; Let us &gt;&gt; let us save. &gt;&gt; Yes. Let us leave the faith of our pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let me just tell you [music] few moments when I was with the pastor what he was saying. I I lost my job. But now I realize this was the will of God for losing the job. I went close to the pastor. Every day every night I was with him when he admitted at the hospital. I was there and brother Mashande was there and the family was there. when the pastor was admitted at the hospital [music] and a lot has happened. I'm just going to pick to save time. There was a time where the pastor departed [music] from this earth on the 22nd of July. I arrived in the morning and then after greeting me he said brother is the program ready I said yes pastor he said okay if the program is ready I'm happy and I started to explain pastor I'm preaching this weekend the other weekend is our elders kosana that other weekend is [music] pastor mua He said, "No, you don't understand me. I mean the program of the [music] funeral." Then I said, "No, pastor, you are not going to die because we will be in rapture together." He said, "Brother, I'm going you brothers continue. Jesus is here. take me back home. Then he said to me, I have finished preaching, so it's my time to go. That was around 9 half 9 between that time. 9. Then that day was not a nice day. But when the pastor said those words, he was happy. He was laughing out loud. I was just listening. I even said to Omar, "This one is bigger than me. Please talk to him. We [singing and music] not talk about death here. We need to talk about the rapture." But the pastor says he's going. Hey, the day goes 7:00 in the afternoon. 7:00, the pastor died. The nurses were crying were throwing out their bags. Then they closed the kitten. The only word I heard in an echo kind of off was when they were trying to resuscitate him. He was gone. After few minutes, he came back. Then he crack a [music] joke. What were you trying to do? And then that's how he came back and everybody started to laugh. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he saw he's coming. He's going. But that time was not the time. She said to me, "Bru, the reason why I [music] came back, there are some few things I need to do, but when I'm done, I go." Amen. That's the one incident I experienced. Then the pastor [music] came out of hospital. We went to a private place in Bronos plate next to the dam where we were looking after him uh you know making sure he's healthier than before. And the other morning when I arrived from my house to see him, I found him smiling he said, "Bru, I saw the children of God in the rapture and you were part of that." I was happy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now he came out there. We went to his house. The pastor is fine. When I was in the house, one incident happened. You know, when I grew up in the message, I received the message in 1989. In 1990, I met the pastor when he was given the communion in Appeland. There's a school there called Marit. Then I met him again in Mali in 1992. There's a room in the pastor's house, upper room. I was told that room no one should enter. Then I was convinced you must not enter. One day the pastor says bro, let's go in that room. I was so frightened because they [singing] say is a no-go room. When we enter there, We sit down. He said, "Don't be shaken. Just relax. Let's just talk." Then we talk very nice things. And I believe many people never entered in that room. I was there with the pastor. Then the other day he called me again. He said, "Brother, my beard are long. Help me to shave." We were together in the room. We were talking and it was nice. Let me not say only the nice things only. Let me tell you what I experienced. One of the days I messed up after messing up. I went to the pastor. We were in that room. When we were there, I said, "Pastor, I messed up. I was preaching and I said some of the things that maybe I was not supposed to say then I need to fix that behind the pullpit. Then the pastor said narrate the story. Narrate the story. I narrated the story. After that he said brother I was dreaming there was nothing wrong. You know what? Even myself when I preach not everybody will believe me. Brother, preach this gospel. Go forward. They will love you. They will not love you. Let's continue going forward closely. After preaching my last sermon in Modi, I was flying to Zambia. Then I went to see the pastor for the prayer of the traveling man. After the prayer, he hold my hand. He said, "Brother, I'm going to miss you." I said, "Pastor, I will go and meet you in the convention." Then he said, "Go and come back again. We must continue preaching this gospel." He was cooking me. I'm well cooked. I will continue with the legacy of the pastor, irrespective of the critics. God bless you. God bless. Amen. All right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; A round of applause for him. [music] As the mommy lady worship team comes, I [music] need the following people to prepare themselves so that we redeem time.

Let me greet you saints in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Greetings to all the pastors all of them. All my pastors &gt;&gt; pastor pastor &gt;&gt; pastor pum &gt;&gt; pastor pum &gt;&gt; pastoral &gt;&gt; pastor I don't see you are not on this side [music] we are thankful to be here pastor always when he stands there he will always say astronaut &gt;&gt; you look on this side says astronaut then you'll be expecting Amen. I asked myself, why am I chosen to speak here? &gt;&gt; They realized that the family realized that the pastor loved me. He [music] loved the entire church. I don't speak long. I am good when it comes to listening. I'll just talk and when did we meet with the pastor by my own experience &gt;&gt; ministry of the seven &gt;&gt; under this ministry of the seven sin the pastor I met the pastor in Kylie Cambridge he was invited by pastor Monagali and pastor Cambridge At that time I didn't really realize anything. I was only knowing the scripture. That's it. &gt;&gt; The pastor spoke about locos. &gt;&gt; He spoke about the theophony. It was a continuation. That thing did something within me. Those are the same experiences that has kept me to be with him until this far. &gt;&gt; 2013 or 2012. &gt;&gt; In 2013 or 2012, False College, &gt;&gt; he was invited by Pastor Khana in False College. &gt;&gt; He spoke about the revelation of the seven sea. What is the ministry of the seven se? &gt;&gt; There was a question that he asked. He asked, "What is the ministry of the seven se? That thing didn't give me rest in my life. It changed me to be with him here, right here. &gt;&gt; He gave us life. It didn't end there. He gave me order in my life. I don't want to talk about someone else. This thing was a thirst in my soul. That order came into the church. &gt;&gt; The pastor loved us so much in Cape Town. &gt;&gt; He continued and he spoke about meek. He will continue with the same series for the entire year until you realize who you are and where are you going? There's a preaching that I love from the pastor, have you met this? He doesn't stop there. He says, have you met him? It shows that you'll never leave here same as you are if you have met him. You'll never hate anyone once you met that is the last 2024 conference &gt;&gt; conference &gt;&gt; that's an experience that I have we are grateful so much for the pastor at the end stone &gt;&gt; he came with a white stone stone &gt;&gt; yeah the white stone tender around. &gt;&gt; The white stone is rolling. Where is it rolling? &gt;&gt; Inside &gt;&gt; because cloud &gt;&gt; because that cloud &gt;&gt; is in us in us. You wish everyone can milk that. Then the lastly the pastor finished by &gt;&gt; the great pyramid &gt;&gt; that is the seven se &gt;&gt; with the white stone our topic today &gt;&gt; that is the great pyram there's another one bless He did very well on time. &gt;&gt; I want you to beat him to eat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; H Let me greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The one standing before you is brother Neville Luana. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know that place [music] he would ask me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh when I was informed to [music] come and speak tonight, I thought of writing a speech speech. But I realized how many pages I'm going to write or how many books am I going to write? Because speaking about pastor You will not stop. Visiting him will not be enough. When when I come to his house, telling him that pastor, we are still graced. He would remind me to relax. I remember there's a message that he once preached in 1992 [music] 1992 &gt;&gt; the 28th of February &gt;&gt; 28th of February relax. &gt;&gt; The title says relax. If you listen to that message and listen to the latest message that he preached, you will see something. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm standing here relaxed. Being relaxed, &gt;&gt; it can be a bit painful. But what I know is that my pastor, our pastor, our grandfather, our father, our uncle, our everything. He's in a better place and that makes me to relax. Amen. Amen. So, from there's many places that I know pastor like to travel and when we travel those places we will just resemble because we knew what is in his heart to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus We knew when we go to the convention if you want to be scolded by the pastor. Don't say you did not come with the other saint because he did not have money. &gt;&gt; You will get a sham. &gt;&gt; You will be scolded. He is a person that will do things from the heart. And when it comes out, you will see the resemblance. So I will not stop and I will not finish. And as I've said from we are sending this message to the family, to the MOI church, to the whole of the world. I have a friend of mine from Uganda, Pastor Lawrence. Pastor Lawrence Mango. After he have seen the message, that our pastor is in glory. He sent me a voice note voice note &gt;&gt; and said, "My brother, I was waiting to listen to the last part of the white stone. But God saw it enough and he [music] took our elder and by so saying tell the children of God they must [music] forge forward. May God bless you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hey doing very well with time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; I greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I greet my pastor this side. I also greet the family and all the friends and the children of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1984. &gt;&gt; I knew Pastor Kurima since 1984. &gt;&gt; Pastor 1984. &gt;&gt; In 1984, Pastor Kurima commissioned Elders Kosana. Elder and others jungles of northwest &gt;&gt; to come to the jungles of northwest &gt;&gt; in the midst of the jungles of the hour. They brought the message of [music] I remember when he started preaching in the jungles of preaching [music] so slow. &gt;&gt; I was surprised. It was my first time to hear the pastor preach so slowing. &gt;&gt; But after that preacher that day but after After having listened to the message that he preached that day, after he left, we we remain focusing his message. &gt;&gt; After the whole church, &gt;&gt; the whole church was baptized. We went to river and we were all baptized. And then it was not only the message of the hour in northwest &gt;&gt; went to. So this is a coronation because we believe he fought a good fight. He kept the faith and he finished the course. Now we that are here now to the family and the church. I don't think that no anybody will fit in his shoes. It is too big. But what the pastor will want. It is somebody who wear his own shoes but will serve the Lord faithfully. So whoever that will be serving on his death just be faithful with the same kind of spirit loving the people and serving the Lord. We say farewell to the warario. May soul rest in peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I greet the the the bride of the lamb. I greet pastor's family. Greeting all the pastors. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because Jan spoken already. Amen. Amen. We thank the Lord because the message they reached us in through this and after this it was it [music] came to us through pastor the way that he would preach. Oh the sound of the trumpets Hallelujah. [snorts] Amen. God bless. A round of applause for the pastor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. I said the man that is going to speak [music] walked with the pastor for many many years and I think he worked it closely with him and would know him much better than many of us outside the family. Who did his kosana? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Uh, I would like to greet you all in the precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ. Uh, you will pardon me. Uh my voice I had flu since Monday I had a flu. So my voice is not okay. &gt;&gt; But I would like to thank uh the family for giving me a chance to say something about the pastor. And I also like to thank the pastors and the church at large. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is true. &gt;&gt; I met the pastor. I I I repented in 1977. 1977. Then I was baptized by the deacons. Then they handed me over to the pastor to mentor me. So myself I was a sharpshooter. Uh I will ask lot of questions. So I said pastor Where can I meet God? Where can I meet God? And the pastor said, "No, you've already met God." I said, "No, I want to see the man himself." Then he said, "Have you got spoken words?" I said, "Yes, I've got three of them." What? And they said, "What what are the titles?" I said, "The first spoken word that they gave me was the stature of a perfect man, the perfect man." &gt;&gt; And the other one was uh demonology and the third one was five identification of the true church of God. So I read them all. But when I was reading them, I was reading them like I read a novel of James Hardley Chase. You start it in the morning uh on your way to work. By the time you come back, you're through with that one. Then you throw it away. Then you said, "No, that's not the right way to read." The first thing that you need to do, you need to identify the dispensations and then followed the ministry itself. And then the ministry has got a doctrine and that doctrine has got a faith. That faith has got an anointing. So if you read like that, then you've got a center of departure. You don't just read a spoken word like you are reading a novel. So that's how he mentored me. So uh I repented in 1977 as I said and then I hear I'm I'm subject to correction. I think they started in the message around 1977 somewhere there72 but they were very few. So what happened is that now he decided to go with me wherever he goes. We we were not only to with some other elders. So we the first place that we went to was and then Switzerland then we went around even up to so we ended up in so now the pastor was not a dictator The pastor will never stand behind the pullpit &gt;&gt; and harass us. He never. Amen. And uh he watches you. If you become rough then he politely remove you from the And then he will stand behind the pull pit and said, "Have you ever have you ever hear me harassing you because you are the souls that comes from God?" Then he was very very respectful. He will never say to me, he always says to every man. You will never call him by the name. There's a suffix always. That's how he was. As brother Mikabi has said here, the pastor has taught us a lot of things. He had a number of sister churches and then he used to go and preach during the week because there are many and we couldn't find a deacon there. We couldn't find a deacon. So he'll dedicate the the the preachers to go around and preach. He was not selfish about the pullpit. [music] &gt;&gt; But he will never put a man behind the pullpit who will talk whatever you want to say. He will check [music] you and check the spirit that is in you. And then when he talks to you, he will never harass you, call you very politely and sit down with you. And he will take time to to to bring his point. At times he could say, "Go and speak to so and so." And then when you go and you would go, you speak a little bit rough. I'm going to send another one say go and speak to that tell him I didn't say he must go and harrise go and repent there that's how it is he loved us all small kids youth elderly people everybody body and he was soft and the man in which was talking he was like a terrestrial rain very soft but his words will find a target that's that's how I know him now in the physically &gt;&gt; you might uh uh we might think that is a weak person but he's very very strong. Now supernaturally there's some things that were happening of which we also could not interpret. And when we try to testify about them we appear as liars. There were hooligans that came to his house. They bind him with with h cable ties ties and then there came a fire that broke those cable ties. There was a time where they were trying to strangle him. These guys that was trying to strangle him, their hands and elbows jammed. Then they took him. They let him kneel on the sofa and close him and put a blanket But he was seeing them. Who's that? Who's that? Who's that? That is say some other testimonies might sound as an exaggeration. One day he was praying for a certain sister from uh Porschia. Porsche maybe Porsha's hair were [music] what do you what do you call it? The hair was reming down. So the pastor put the hand on top of Kizer is there as my witness the hair started growing and he himself would say I don't know I just put a hand and those hairs started growing so yeah there's quite a lot there's lot of testimony but the greatest part of it was that He was uh in closing, pastor, he he had an understanding of what he would say. He will never say something unless he understand what he's talking about. When we repented, there was a commotion. You know, in the message there's always a doctrinal commotion. Yes. These believe that these so a bishop here bishop he came along there were the thunder group there were certain young people. Yeah. So bishop said what are these standards? [music] Then the pastor said go and ask them. Then he went said what are these standards? They said no you're behind time. No you are behind [music] time. You don't know what thunders are. We want what was uttered by the thunders. So now he was very very careful in in in in in in uttering some other instances. Yes. Because of time I will stop here but you know in football we say there's a a a captain of captains. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now the pastor I always used to call him if there's a captain of captains uh to me. He was an elder of elders. He he used to call the ministry. He used to call the ministry The ministry he called it the sheep of Zion. Say this ministry is the ship of Zion. &gt;&gt; The captain of that ministry knows every root in the sea. He knows even the sizes of the waves. will never go and ram it on an iron bag. Ice bag will cruise. He will cruise. That is the ship of Zion. Nobody can stand before that ship. That's what he used to say. May the Lord bless you. Bless you. [music] Amen. All right, brother Timothy is in the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From Switzerland. &gt;&gt; Sweiland. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'm just going to swap things around here and then we let me do this because there's a pressure of time pastor from Zimbabwe. Pastor Godwin from Zimbabwe. You'll say some few words. God bless you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Just want to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Uh what brings me here &gt;&gt; is because I believe in this message. &gt;&gt; I know people that would come touch something fire then the next thing there's nothing. But brother from the first time I met him, it was in 1979 &gt;&gt; when we we went to a con a convention in Cape Town but passing through Mame Loi passing through uh whenever we came from Harari to South Africa would go to the mafiris. It is it was like our home. You always welcomed us and we really went on with the ministry the ministry of this message and we have been seeing them growing as quiet as so spoken as he is. he would have time to go to Switzerland, do something there, come back here. When he came to Malawi, he always came and slept by our house. When he was going there and when he was coming back, he was always just gent gentle. And uh what what really worries me now Like the Lord Jesus one time said, "Simon, Simon, &gt;&gt; do you love me more than all these? Feed my sheep and feed my lambs. If you love your pastor, look after the sheep. feed them the sheep and the lambs. They need to be looked after. We don't want to hear that this thing has disintegrated and and some funny man comes from West Africa with all kinds of nonsense. We have been trained by Malachi 4. We stand with the word. We believe the word. And God makes us see the word work in our lives. So I am very keen to see this church even going on further and further and higher and higher and deeper and deeper. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; also in the natural um brother is a relative of mine. We belong to the family of Monomapa. We are a very very high dynasty. But everything comes to an end sometime. So we want to make sure that this does not become a pepper fire. Just put a small fire there and then when you look outside there's nothing. This thing has been on for a long time. And the other hidden blessing that I have from that church is the scos they are such a big blessing to us and it's a pity that they had also become very good friends with one of our men that was a lead guitarist. He was from our church that could shake the world with his guitar because gifts are given to people by go by God. But uh he's he's been taken home. And then uh the day we buried him, I made a statement. &gt;&gt; I said in the scriptures in the days of David, uh David said who is there? That is a close relative. And they found there was a a son a lamb son called meet. And David says from now onwards you stay in the palace you live in the palace eat in the palace because of what your father did. So even that I said his daughter I said the vehicle that we wanted to buy for your father we are going to buy it for you and it will be yours &gt;&gt; for as long as you want it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words we leave some our children as well. Uh we don't want to be overtaken by things that come from West Africa &gt;&gt; and make people eat snakes and things that come from Malawi and call themselves bushies. Anyway, most people are afraid to attack these people. Never been afraid of any of them. confronted them and will confront them because I know that greater is he that is in me than he that is in those people. We will prevail. We have prevailed. So young men, you people that are still young, get deep in the word. Get deep in prayer and get to a point where you really know that you are part of it. Don't be afraid to take your position. We don't want this thing to just crumble to nothing. If the man that was running with the button stick, if he has run his course, it must land in someone's hand. It's up to you people to make sure that the man that will be taking that position is a man of integrity, &gt;&gt; a man who knows what he's doing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And a man who loves and believes the message. And it must be somebody who is not afraid to confront to confront the devil whatever form he comes in. He wouldn't want to have worked for nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a man from West Africa called Kaku trying to come to certain areas to try to deceive people. No, don't allow anything actually to just say if someone comes from West Africa with a desire to preach and so forth, we say please we have enough preachers here. and keep your West Africa and the juju thereof. And leave us here with our music and our way of doing things because many many nations are being destroyed by these things from West Africa. West Africa, &gt;&gt; they know what they are doing. &gt;&gt; Anyway, one of the times at least I I like brave people. One of the things that I like about Madiva is because he's bold. You all know you heard the story. They had a man had come to destroy the message in South Africa. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he almost did. &gt;&gt; But there came a time when it we we begin began to get information about what the man is doing. And I I saw Satan fall like lightning. So I have given you power to tread against serpents and all these things. Nothing shall by any means hurt you. He was shocked. That man was shocked and and we drove him out of this country. And when he got back to his country, they made him an archbishop &gt;&gt; in the Catholic church because it destroyed the message here. We don't allow anything in the pull pit unless we know who it is and where he's coming from. We don't want to be nice people. We want to do what is right. Amen. So we are moving on. I don't want to hear that this church has now scattered this one going there there. No. Jesus said, "If you love me, feed my sheep and feed my lambs." And we don't want to hear that this church is splitting up this one, this one. No, just work together. If you know of a good preacher somewhere that can give your sheep more than you can give on a certain subject. If you take like a man like George Martin, he just had it. So we loved him because he had depths. He had a way of doing things and he was always in the scriptures. And when you know people that are talented that are talented and that mean business, work with them. Give them the chance and uh let them give you the chance as well. And uh we are doing very very well. &gt;&gt; Uh I think by the end of the year we are going to have a big tent meeting in Mozambique. We are going to have tent campaigns to make sure that this southern region we are doing our part many of you ministers here I want you to understand me. We have an obligation. Brother Branham came to South Africa. The pillar of fire came to South Africa. The supernatural was demonstrated in South Africa and brother Brham so much wanted to come to Africa and every opportunity that we have to make sure that brother Brham's message that God gave him we have given you to the people. We have given it to the people. I know my brother Miba, he likes one of the things I always say. We don't want to be cheap Africans. Don't be a cheap African to go overseas because when the devil is blocking away everywhere, then it's time to get angry with the devil. Get angry with the devil. Brother Brham says this one time. They were at a certain place and there was a there was a nice looking young lady. But she had lost her mind. She was just saying all things that are can't make out what brother he wanted to just know who is this one. What's what's going on with this one? What's going on? Then someone says this is the daughter of that very famous man of God. Brother Brham said when they said that was the daughter of a man that I knew to be a man of God. He said he said something came upon me. He said something came upon me. And within a short time that devil was driven away. In other words, something must come upon you. When you see the work you have worked for all these years. Amen. &gt;&gt; All these years. When you see now something someone splitting, going this way, someone this way. The time you're going to confront someone say, "Brother, you don't want to build on someone's reputation. If you really believe in your ministry, go start somewhere. Not start taking sheep. Come over here. I'll make you a table. Ah, no. No. We don't want that. We want to make sure. Do all your best and let's keep on going. We just had a good we had a good time in Zambia. They built a wonderful church in Zambia and they are doing very well. They also went there to dedicate their church and they are moving on very strong. We don't want the region to suffer. When we say the region all wherever we are message we don't want to have things falling apart. The ministers be kind to one another. be nice to one another and then make sure the church goes on. Even if the church becomes a little bit too big, it's not a problem, you will still have enough time for that church. This church for all I know in South Africa is purely black church is this one church the black church this one if there are any others I know not where they are where they are but this one I've always known them coming the mafiris and all and my friends we come a long way and whenever we came here we always we always accommodated and we want you we want to accommodate you when you come as well when we come to singing we are not going to as long as we know you are going to be singing. We will be quiet because it's not our area. We don't know what to do with singing over here. &gt;&gt; That's just what you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh if God gives us grace, we will be building a convention center that can seat a lot of people. And then we can also have places for singers. The people here you are singers. Once in a while we can also make up something but uh it's not our gift. Amen. Even all this time know the drum just the drum and the singing with nothing else. People were getting in the spirit because they know that rhythm. So we want to assure you, brethren, don't let this church be destroyed. And if you can make sure that you work together, you work together &gt;&gt; to keep on going. May God bless you all. I've been accompanied. I came with my wife and my two daughters. They are here with us [music] and uh once in a while &gt;&gt; once in a while we would like to just come in see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

I would like to thank our pastors from far and near. Those who came. &gt;&gt; I would also like to thank the family of our pastor. And the main thing I would like to thank Omar &gt;&gt; to grant me the opportunity. I I think you can see that I'm still young. his first trip to Bo. &gt;&gt; He had nothing. &gt;&gt; He was not driving. 1976. &gt;&gt; We started in 1976. It was &gt;&gt; after he found the prophet's books from the true church of God. &gt;&gt; At that time we were fellowshiing at the truth church of God. By then, Raesa was on on leave. &gt;&gt; He then read the books because we were still young. 1920, &gt;&gt; not that young. We about 1920. And then brother and then brother Getty testified to us about the message &gt;&gt; we were together in the true church. But when the prophet's books arrived and those small tracks then he then said to us &gt;&gt; this thing this matter of this man referring to brotherham if it's like this man from Lord they they have it like is he then left us by saying I am going to be baptized and then the leave was over. He then came back to Modi at that time. There was there were no phones. We were using letters. He then wrote a letter to us. He then asked us as to what are we saying. &gt;&gt; We also said we also want to be baptized as a group. &gt;&gt; April 76 in April. He organized that in April of 1976 conference &gt;&gt; that it be a conference. That's where I was baptized. I was baptized by Elder Masuka. When we were baptized, pastor was going around out of the water, going back into the village. our conference. We would feit in a in a round in a small house. That was our conference from there. They went back. They came with their from there. Then the pastor, he starts a journey &gt;&gt; to come to Bo. At that time he did not have a car. &gt;&gt; He was using a train. &gt;&gt; It will leave Ptoria 8 in the in the night. &gt;&gt; It would arrive in &gt;&gt; Petersburg 5. &gt;&gt; It was 5 in the morning. &gt;&gt; 5 6 5 6 in the morning. And at that time he was supposed to stay at the station and then 7 around 7 he will leave from the station &gt;&gt; he would go to the bus ring the the bus to bo I'm I'm telling you about the trip of a man who had a burden in his heart so that he could further own the children of God. 11:00 the bus will leave around about 11:00 during the day. At that time, brother K wrote us letters telling us the pastor is coming. The best the bus will depart at 11 from Petersburg to where we stay and then it &gt;&gt; it doesn't come exactly to our place. It will go pass by our place. It will arrive around about 3. Having boarded the bus at 11, it will arrive a place called around about 3. From there to where we stay, &gt;&gt; there is no taxi, there's no car, &gt;&gt; we would walk. &gt;&gt; We would walk through the trees, a distance of 5 kilos. &gt;&gt; It could be about 5 kilometers walking. At that time you were the ones who were supposed to help the pastor with his bags so that he could walk because we were used to it. We should arrive while there still time. At that time we should have a service that old man of God he worked When he was coming to our place, we knew that we must go welcome him. The following day he would go on. He born he would born in a bus again and then from there he would then come to &gt;&gt; until there was a formation of a church or congregation. He then ordained a pastor. &gt;&gt; He then retired and come back to work. We then pastor then ordained and then and then the church grew from and then comes from. So mama is the one who requested me at least &gt;&gt; so that people know that when they speak about pastor today they know him. They see him driving a car. They should know that he comes from far. He walked using with his own feet. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that in this time there could be a pastor could take that kind of a chance. And many of us in this part on that group that we were baptized together, many of them as the message progressed, we started seeing some true colors because they start by saying They say you guys meaning like referring to me, &gt;&gt; you worship a man, &gt;&gt; you follow a man, &gt;&gt; but that which was in my heart and that what I was seeing, &gt;&gt; this man lived the message preach a message. He preached the message &gt;&gt; the one that he leaves &gt;&gt; but us especially &gt;&gt; especially myself because &gt;&gt; because I believe that among that group &gt;&gt; from 1976 &gt;&gt; from 1976 &gt;&gt; you can count as to how how many years 49 years &gt;&gt; it's about for 9 years &gt;&gt; next year April &gt;&gt; next year April 50 years &gt;&gt; it will be 50 years I'm I'm the only one who remained in that group when Elder Elder G was coming. So today we thank the Lord because I remember when we're now this time this side of saying to Elders I say elder I am growing old I'm going back home at that There was already some divisions because the pastor they no longer wanted him that side myself. I believed his ministry. I was saying this to elders kosana. I said, "What then are we going to do?" Because I'm going back home. Where are we going to fellowship? And said, "Don't worry. We will arrange especially myself. I thought that if would find a place, it won't be a problem for me to leave. God blessed us again and then branch back at home in Bo. Children of God, we are speaking about a man who sacrificed his life because 76. Yes. [music] &gt;&gt; Imagine the years that he preached, the years that went over 50 years. Subtract the 50 years from his years that he lived, you'll see that his entire life he lived in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Even today, As I'm speaking to you, I am following what the pastor taught me. &gt;&gt; Next year, April, February, next year, February, &gt;&gt; next next year in February, 70 years, &gt;&gt; I will be 70 years old. &gt;&gt; And then I want you to to from 1976 &gt;&gt; from 1976 when I will be doing You will see that my life I lived under the grace of God because of the man who showed me I am not a preacher. I'm a follower. That old man taught me that when people work in the field, &gt;&gt; when they would be working the field, [music] &gt;&gt; when someone comes, finding you working, he will then leave you, take at the home and I am thankful. life on the other side is better than the life this I am thankful standing here on [clears throat] behalf of friends uh You will forgive me. I'm not going to be long. I had a lot of things to talk to to speak about our brother. Our pastor [clears throat] &gt;&gt; when I I I I first know my pastor &gt;&gt; 1967. &gt;&gt; It was in 1967 Assemblies of God. &gt;&gt; That's when I arrived at Assemblies of God. As the pastor was talking about pastor Benu, pastor Ben was our pastor. &gt;&gt; We were together with &gt;&gt; we were all at assemblies of God. &gt;&gt; We thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sister, &gt;&gt; you did not think it would be like this when these things started. &gt;&gt; You did not believe just briefly. When I first met the pastor, he was with &gt;&gt; and two and then brother and brother. &gt;&gt; The late brother. &gt;&gt; The late brother. and the late as the pastor as pastor said &gt;&gt; about my family it was our center we would gather there but before I could receive the message he left me and went for another church that's where he got the books of the message &gt;&gt; because we were friend assemblies of God. &gt;&gt; Because we were friends and assemblies of God, &gt;&gt; we were living like families. &gt;&gt; I knew his family. He knew my family. After he after he received the message, he then remembered me. He came to me. He brought the books. He He even borrowed me a tape. At that time, we knew that we had the gospel. We knew that God says sins are forgiven. them. They would carry backs with the spoken word in it. Then I thought to myself, these men are suffering. &gt;&gt; But by the grace of God, but they told me about the prophet, I saw to him, my brother Luke. It's true. This man went through or he has played his role. But it's our it's time that we also run our our race. &gt;&gt; But it was true in short message. &gt;&gt; The day I received the message, God made that we there be commotion at church &gt;&gt; in the assemblies assemblies of God. Then I started to read the spoken word spoken word. I started to read God's chosen place of worship. Amen. It's the one that God opened my eyes with the main thing that I came here to say briefly unusual God who operate in unusual ways. He was very shy. He was shy. In these &gt;&gt; we would form a group and sing in the assemblies of God &gt;&gt; and then he knew how to play guitar. &gt;&gt; He was the one play guitar for us. &gt;&gt; But for him to play that guitar. They should put a chair for him so he could hide when playing the guitar. He wouldn't stand up. We will stand up and sing. The reason I say God works in mysterious ways, nobody will believe one day he will be a pastor. as a street preacher &gt;&gt; in trains wherever I am I will stand in the street but he wouldn't do that message &gt;&gt; but after he has received the message then I would ask who's preaching they would say until until I receive the message and go there because there's one thing we we we we live together. We working together. If you know, he was working at church square and church. &gt;&gt; I was working at Andre and church. &gt;&gt; We we would be together during lunch time. &gt;&gt; Even when we knock off, we would be together. It was someone that I know very well. I remember one day. I I remember one day I said to him, "Tell me, how are you going to get married?" Because because he was shy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God makes wonders when I was with him. &gt;&gt; He would take [music] me and place me a pastor because of how I was preaching at the streets. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that when you preach at the streets, &gt;&gt; you've got a gift of being a pastor. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. After I received the message, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My wife remained there. You know what they said? a special river. They said when we in the mer they said those people they've got a special river where they &gt;&gt; they worship brenam. Then she she realized she was surprised when we went to to baptize we use the same river at the fabric. Here's one last thing. &gt;&gt; The time we received the message, &gt;&gt; we would always go to brother's church for for conferences to conferences. Yes. During Easter, during festival seasons, one day he came to us and said, That's what that was when brother Mat was on the other side where there was people who believed the message he said let's go to and have our conference there &gt;&gt; the reason why if we bring these people here's church They would preach in English, interpret in Africans. When you bring old bed women, they will not hear anything. That's when we started the way to. That's how the work started. From there, it went further on through the man God used through pastor. I thank God because I don't know now is how many pastors us back because of how God used him. That's why I'm saying God operates in unusual ways just spoke something that is very crucial. During that time had no car. We would travel by railway buses. Everybody would board in that bus. People would drink in those buses. &gt;&gt; Yes. But he will tolerate going towards Petersburg when we sometimes would go to Switzerland. You remember in the passage, &gt;&gt; brother Gab was still reminding that you remember that we would passage five brothers. &gt;&gt; Four or five brothers. &gt;&gt; We thank May God bless her. By the time they were they used to stay in the flat before they before they could build their own house &gt;&gt; we would all in the flat she would sleep together with his children with pastor. Hallelujah. Amen. Who can a church traveling by bus sleeping on the floor? &gt;&gt; He worked. May God bless you. God bless you. Amen. I will call [music] Cape Town not now but I will give them an indication. Pastor Salm as you come my pastor. [music] God bless you. Much much have been said about pastor. I don't have many things to say about him. I just wanted to tell you a story and u how we met and uh how we fell in love each other. Yes. Because for me it's a a story love. &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't know that. I think I'm the first lover of Pastor Kima in this building. I love Pastor Kurima better than anyone here. So I I I I met him. I met him in 2009. 2009 &gt;&gt; I was invited in a conference at a tabernacle pastor Zakola. &gt;&gt; It was in 2009 2009 &gt;&gt; and I was in that conference and I saw an old man preaching [music] very mysterious things. seven seals. Oh, I say, "Who is that man?" Because at that time, I thought I was the only one preaching those things. Then I found someone, an old man, preaching very deep things, even better than me. I say, "Oh, this man, I must stick with him." So just after the service I I run to him and I I I got his contact and he was with brother Mete &gt;&gt; and few months after I invited him to DRC because I'm the first one who invited Pastor Kod and DRC. Yeah. So now you can understand why he called me his first son. &gt;&gt; Pastor Kodima is not my pastor. He's my father. &gt;&gt; Yes, he's my father. Amen. And uh I'm the first one and Pastor Freddy is the second one. And that's all. [laughter] &gt;&gt; No, everywhere. [laughter] Everywhere. Everywhere. So when we invited at that time we were just a small church and when they came [music] he didn't come himself. He came with sisters and We didn't have money. How can you accommodate all those? And and we arranged something for the sisters. And uh I asked them to be accommodated in hotel. And they say no. I said okay. So what's now? And the sister said, "We sleep here." I say, "Where?" In the living room. Hey. I say, "Who are those men? Where's those sisters? Where they are coming from?" And they were there the whole night singing in the living room, singing with my kids. And they brought sweet for my kids and for And I found them very special people. They were very special brothers and sisters. They were very special. And the pastor was very humble. He didn't ask me anything. So anything that I he wanted, he was sweet potatoes. And he asked my wife to to cook some sweet potatoes for him. He liked those sweet potatoes because you know the sweet potatoes in Kong are not like yours here. Yours here is not good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't have sweet potatoes. Come to come when you eat sweet potatoes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they want you to eat pondu. &gt;&gt; Pondu. You know pondu you don't know ponduh pondu pondu is cava leaves it's so sweeten just ask about brother so if anyone of you want to eat those things just come to cook so they brought sweet for me and for my kids and my wife cooked potatoes for them then We fell in love and that's how it started. And then I come to visit Melody and I found very nice people. Let me tell you, you are the most spiritual church in the world. Yeah. The the best people I ever met. in the message world are the members of Mamelo. So let me let me let me how do you say in English? Let let me give you flowers. &gt;&gt; Flowers. &gt;&gt; Oh yes flowers. And so you are the product of a very strong ministry. &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't know that you have a good character which is the result of a very strong and good ministry. And uh and uh today I feel so lonely and sad. Yeah. Very sad because my father is not here. And uh I I'm afraid please don't lose that character. Just keep it. Please &gt;&gt; keep it keep it. The the the the the preaching the sermon that Pastor Kima was preaching all of these years has made you what you are today. Best people ever. And uh today I just come here to say to express my love for pastor and my love for you all. I just love you. God bless you. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] I'm going to ask pastor Jim from Mozambi from Mozambi. And then we are going to ask the professor and then brother Morris from Morris &gt;&gt; and brother from I trust this man will go for two minutes. Amen. Amen. As they come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Please, brother Carlos, can you come over? &gt;&gt; No, Carlos. &gt;&gt; Brother Carlos, can you come to the stage? Sorry, I'll not speak in English. I will speak in Portuguese &gt;&gt; so that I can feel. You apologize me. &gt;&gt; I want to greet you in this evening because of this great ceremony which we have today. We were got in the corner. Today we are here to celebrate his life, the life of this great man. We got many things to say but we are not saying much. So we just resume it. I was given only two minutes. &gt;&gt; I will try just I will try to use this two minutes. I don't know if the message will get you. We came here to say that Satan is a liar. Because he thinks when he take out the messenger he think that the ministry will fall when the messenger is taken. Do we want to say in the the the raised voice this evening that Satan is a liar? &gt;&gt; This ministry is not a ministry to fall. I can't see the way to make this ministry fall. &gt;&gt; That ministry of M Lord will fall. I don't see the way. &gt;&gt; We want to exalt the brothers from here South Africa &gt;&gt; that you take the character of that man. You know when the Lord Jesus was crucified, some disciple thought that the work was over. They start to go the other ways until Peter who was most trusted. He returned to the fishing. Some brothers went to a mouse. Uh we don't want to hear this happening here. So celebrating the going to glory of the pastor. I feel myself that he was the man who you should listen what he has to say. &gt;&gt; I feel like that tabernacle. Yeah. I could take all day in my room close the day listening only. I felt very profound things that helped me. So I tried I I I start to to to find a way to get inside that that sea that beach. But today I'm satisfied. I'm very content because don't ask me how I did it. I'm happy because I in the middle of the brothers was a very humble man. &gt;&gt; It was a man who could get inside Mozambique. Mozambi is not like South Africa, &gt;&gt; but he went through the jungles of Mozambique. Speaking about, we are talking about a city, but he went inside the depths of Mozambique. We are talking about Mach where the brother come from. It's a Dick Street. We are talking about Vanuzi. We are talking about also &gt;&gt; talking about this places some people here couldn't done it but he got there sleeped there he ate there this humility many of us we can't do it that's why in this this time I give thanks to be here celebrating the the the his life in my heart I I felt that he is not dead. &gt;&gt; The prophet of the time said, &gt;&gt; he said that the the debt for a a a believer. It's only the transfer from one dimension to another. I believe that our pastor is not dead. He is somewhere &gt;&gt; one of these days we will be together with him. We want to encourage &gt;&gt; in the name of all our all Mozambicans. &gt;&gt; The sister who a sister who were left by pastor his wife to be to to to maintain in what your husband was doing. That day beyond the curtain of time, &gt;&gt; we will be with our pastor. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Professor as he comes &gt;&gt; while he's coming there is a MercedesBenz seatless white in colored &gt;&gt; registration is LN46 &gt;&gt; registration LN46 &gt;&gt; TRGP &gt;&gt; TRGP &gt;&gt; LN46 TRGP LN46 TRGP &gt;&gt; Just remove it. It's just standing in the way. God bless you. Greetings saints. &gt;&gt; I am standing here to speak on behalf of all Malawians who have been greatly touched by the ministry of our pastor. The best would have been pastoring to deliver this. But as we see, he has another due date. So I've come with a few Malawians. My wife, she can stand up and also my sister, my brother-in-law, they stay here in Ptoria. Amen. &gt;&gt; But uh my pastor pastor said please represent Malawi there &gt;&gt; because somehow he had some soft spot spot &gt;&gt; for Malawi Malawi. He started feasting Malawi in the early days. In those days, he would drive all by himself 2,000 kilometers to come and preach in Malaw. [applause] You talk of a life of service that someone who has lived a purpose for God. The prophet talks about flowers. They come out and then they give fragments and they go, the bees take out some food from them. Then they go, they have saved their life. Pastor has saved his life. Pastor Kima preached for a number of people in the early days. He ped he preached in Zumba for pastor. He preached for pastor. Both of these are already gone to glory. He continued to preach for pastor in area 18. Then he came and preached for my pastor pastor in 2011 2011 and we were honored that my family hosted him with brother and that's how we became closer. He invited us to be meetings. Then we just clicked. We were honored that he called me his friend. As he has called many people, it reminds me what the Bible says. If you receive a prophet in the name of prophet, you shall receive a prophet's reward. And someone asked the prophet William Brham. Someone asked the prophet William Brham. Someone asked asked. The Bible talks about a prophet's reward. What is this prophet's reward? Or righteous man's reward. Or righteous man's reward. Righteous man. The the answer was very simple. The prophet says the prophet's reward is to be his friend. So all of us are the friends because we received pastor and the prophet continued that one day it will do you good. When you a prophet when you are a friend to a prophet one day he'll pray for you. When you're friend to a prophet one day you'll be with him. And we believe we'll be with pastor because we received him as our pastor and therefore we have become his friend. So all of us are his friend. I wish in a special way to thank pastoring who in the later days has been a great connector between Modi and Malawi. to a point where when he was constructing his house, he dedicated one room that this is pastor's room. Such a love, such a great love. And uh it so happened that in in 2022 uh pastor pastoring's son was getting married and of course because of the wedding there were so many people from his village and he requested our house to host pastor for a few days. We were privileged to host him. Little did we know that that was his last time to come to Malawi. We always value and enjoy pastor. Each time we come to their house with mama, he would take us in a special way with my wife. We would ask him questions. He tell us testimonies. Testimonies out of his heart. A true and great friend. Our daughter got married and during their honeymoon they came to see him this year on 8th June 2025. June 25. But for me and my wife, our last encounter with pastor was on 3rd June 3rd August 2025. This is the time when a lot of members came to the wedding of pastoring's daughter. As we as we all dancing around He had his daughter Dodo was speaking to him via a video WhatsApp call WhatsApp. Then she called us to come and speak to him. When we saw the him on the WhatsApp calls, he brightened up in a very special way. He said &gt;&gt; this year, &gt;&gt; I'm coming to Malawi &gt;&gt; and I'll be at your house. Those words, we will never forget them. He will not come to Malawi physically but pastor is with us through the message that has impacted our lives. His message that he has preached to Malawians will live on. And that's the message that has taken us closer to Christ closer to the message of the hour. And with those words that he preached to us one day very shortly we shall be together with him. God bless you. God bless you. Hallelujah. One less than one week. Yes. The one in front of you as pastor mentioned from mine is just short to me. Pastor was my father to me both spiritually and physically. He was again my brother. He was again my friend. But the part that I love the most in him is that time when I called him a captain. Why am I saying that he's a captain? Because he he was able that he would defeat every battle and win. There was no battle that I reported to pastor and he did not overcome. Even if it comes in, even if it comes spiritually &gt;&gt; or on earth or from the water, but I would be more happy if it would come from underworld because that's where he would now defeat it. That's why I call is my captain. We a church. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what kind of a disease is all the difficult diseases. It could be cancer. It might be diabetes, HIV, it could be HIV. But if it reaches to my captain, the one that I'm speaking about now, we all bow down and leave. That is the reason I call him. &gt;&gt; He is my captain. He is also your captain. He introduced to us the dead pool and the revelation of the seven seal. He told us that when we combine these two, the devil stand no chance. Even today, the devil does not have power over the third pool and the church. If you combine the two, the devil flee. May the Lord bless us. I am certain because this is my second pastor. I I first lost. I know the pain of losing the pastor. Now it's happening again to me. I'm now losing. But here is what I'm saying to the church. God is God is and God is alive. If we would stay in the teachings of Pastor, we will see where we going. I would like to close with this dimension that pastor used to teach us about the sixth dimension where there's a prophet now where is and where others are. I'm imagine when they see him coming, they all stood on their feet. &gt;&gt; They said, "You fought a good fight." &gt;&gt; 50 years of the ministry. &gt;&gt; 50 years. &gt;&gt; Welcome to the sixth dimension. We are coming. You are the one that you are going to usher us. and and and introduce us. We will never lose sight of that. We are thankful with his few words and thank Amen. The patience that he has. Amen. I'm giving you recommendations. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless. &gt;&gt; Greetings to the beloved bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This is Joseph, the son [music] of Israel. Joseph is a flame born by the fire called Israel. &gt;&gt; Um my pastor has given me very few minutes. I won't be long. I'm standing here children of God on behalf of the saints in if I could be given 10 hours I won't finish the testimony of the impact of the ministry of the third pool and that third pool being a man. That man being Joseph's father. &gt;&gt; Pastor Salm. My beloved pastor. I want to remind you the sermon you preached in April 2011 in Kalinan. remembering our origin. You still remember that? My brother, you said to me, "Brother Joseph, &gt;&gt; Joseph, &gt;&gt; what you need to do, is to find God, wearing a suit and a tie and stand behind that God." God bless you, my brother. Amen. God bless as we stand to our feet and then we're not going to take time immediately after the pastor is done &gt;&gt; uh will brother Timothy Timothy &gt;&gt; will shake the hole. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; As pastor prefer it that way. Just give us a worshiing song as the pastor comes to the father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music and singing] Simmon.

But God has taught me how to cry. I just have to preach because that's the way the pastor taught me how to cry. The best way to ventilate is to preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Gracious Lord, we deem it as a great privilege once again that we are here. Thank you for the gift which you given to us &gt;&gt; in a form of pastor Kodima. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Now that he has pleased you to take him or out of us, Father God, want to celebrate his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not going to get tired here. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; As he would have not kept and tired had been it was me who had died. &gt;&gt; I know Pastor Kim would have been there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't have gotten tired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I as one of the people who have benefited from his ministry, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to do the same for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if the sun can rise up when we are here, I'll not get tired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I know a man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Who was behind that man? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, for what you've done for us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Giving us an example. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Such a good example. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we know &gt;&gt; that he has told us &gt;&gt; there is a better place behind the veil. &gt;&gt; And he has gone beyond beyond us as committing ourselves into holy hands. Father in Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um a lot of people have told about uh friendship with pastor. Uh I will not tell you much. Um pastor I first saw him in 1990. We talked over the years. I was his driver there. Here from 1990 we were meeting very often because Malawi was his home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh we only became friends uh after 24 years of interaction driving him around but because I was younger then I was going higher. As the African proverb says, if a child washes his hands well, he can eat with the elders. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So from being his driver and his caretaker and uh we became friends and u we saw each other more not le not less than three times a year. I'll be at his house. Amen. Amen. God bless you. This thing is not working, isn't it? &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it's not. &gt;&gt; It's not working. &gt;&gt; Okay, it's not working. It's good that it's not working. &gt;&gt; Uh because I would have I would have taken you till your morning because I had some videos. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, to me has been a very good leader. You know nowadays &gt;&gt; we got this type of generals a general sends his soldiers to battle and he goes to hide in a banker a supposed to go in front and to tell you I am in front. So, pastor has gone in front to say to me, don't fear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, don't fear. &gt;&gt; Our pastor's gone in front of us. We will go where he is because we are believing what he preached. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't fear our pastor's going to be in front of us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's start from reading from the book of u Psalms. &gt;&gt; Psalms 42. from there. Then we um read one &gt;&gt; verse one and you can sit down and I will continue. &gt;&gt; Don't worry even if you sleep I will still preach. Amen. Is there anybody to read for me? Okay. &gt;&gt; Psalms 42 verse one. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As the heart pentth after the water brooks, so pentth my soul after thee, oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So a heart panteth after water &gt;&gt; because for the heart Water is life. Even if your heart is injured once it drinks water, it rejuvenates and my soul panteth after thee, oh God, my brother, my sister, so many times have I come to be with a pastor when he was in the hospital. when he was at home. Not in a day did I hear him saying, "My brother, I am worried. I'm going to die." He never feared death because he saw punted after God. Why do we p after God? goes within us. There is a deep call going to the deep. Hallelujah. You know my brother, my sister, this life is good. The same life which you can be coughing, you can have HIV, you can have TP, people say it is good. What about that eternal life? How good is it? Why don't I p after it? That's right. If this life with all its problems is good, how good is that eternal life? How good is it? That's why my soul p after thee, oh God. Now, how do we talk about these things? How did we know that is there's eternal life? Because if you go to Psalms 42:2 says, "My soul is for God. How did you get that faith for God? Is because from the beginning you have tested that face. You cannot forel unless you've drunk Castell before. &gt;&gt; Sorry, you cannot test for Castel beer. I am testing for eternal life because I have tested it before. None of you have ever been to Malawi. Oh, there's Professor Gunda. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, Professor. Okay. God bless you, Professor Gund. I'll tell you people the only thing which you know is grapes and what and what and there are those natural fruits people who have been in a country which they know of they will thirst for things which their mother taught them this is food you cannot thirst for something which you have never have a desire before. When you just when you are thirsting for something, it's either it's missing from your body or you have tested it before the body cause for that specific element. element which went missing from our bodies. One day they found a boy who was eating raba. When they made they tested him they found that in his body the safer levels were low. So he was trying to repress that suffer in him. His body was calling for suffer. That's why my body now is crying for eternal life because in me I am longing for that eternal life because it has gone out of me through Adam. Now I myself I am thinking &gt;&gt; as a young man came to brother to to to Jesus Jesus I have observed all the rules I've been good but I am missing eternal life anybody who is missing eternal life will be looking for it. If I'm looking for it, that means eternal life is not ours because the Bible says, "Seek and shall be given." If you don't seek eternal life be given to you because this message is for those who are looking for it because when Andrew Andrew comes to Peter he doesn't want to he didn't explain to him there was no way to convince Peter, we have found him. That was enough because from the beginning they were looking for him. Jesus will never come to you. They were not looking for him. When Philip comes to Nathaniel, he tells him, "We have found him." &gt;&gt; And they asked, &gt;&gt; he asked, "Where is he from?" &gt;&gt; Where is he from? He's from Malawi. &gt;&gt; Malawi. &gt;&gt; The way how Malawi, how can he come from Malawi? We need preachers from America, not from Yes. It's like that in the Bible. They were speaking Arabic. They were speaking Greek. The the messengers, the other people said, "These are Malawians up there. How can they speak Greek?" Right? They were people of a low quality. When they come to their country, they were mad dubbers. But God visited those people. They were Galileans. When the Greeks come to to ask for Jesus, what did they ask for? &gt;&gt; Philip. Philip. and he was a Galian. These are Greeks, very educated people, very people deep in science. But who did they ask to find Jesus? They asked who? Philip. And he was from where? The Bible says he was from where? He was from Galilee. Let me take an example of South Africa. He was from a man from Pritoria is asking from I want to see Jesus. Ask the man from he show you Jesus. Jesus &gt;&gt; before in they don't talk about Lamborghinis and masalates and whatever they just talking about Jesus there they will see Jesus before you ask them where is Jesus they will tell you where he is Because &gt;&gt; Philip Philip &gt;&gt; and Andrew Andrew &gt;&gt; and Nathaniel &gt;&gt; when they were in their home country they talked nothing else apart from how is the Messiah going to be that's why you find all these people who were telling each other we have found him they were Galians Hey, when he woke up, &gt;&gt; where did he go? &gt;&gt; Tell them, &gt;&gt; "Where have I gone?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when we are here, &gt;&gt; we are supposed to miss something. My brother, I don't know what what what what who are you and where you come from, but if you are not missing God, you have missed everything. If you have missed God, you have missed everything. Let me be clear. If you have missed the prophet of Malachi 4, you have missed everything because we came here to wait for the coming of the prophet who was going to restore the hearts of the children back to the fathers. That's the reason why we are here. Hey my brother, we're not here to get rich. &gt;&gt; We were coming here &gt;&gt; to wait for his advent. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are coming. We are here to wait for his coming. Whatever comes after that is just something to keep us maybe fresh. But what we came home to come for this coming to await for his coming. Whether we are going to sleep, whether we are going to meet him, that doesn't matter. Because what we are doing here &gt;&gt; is waiting. &gt;&gt; We have come here to wait for him and sometimes we forget &gt;&gt; that we are waiting for him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you come to Psalms 42:7, what does he say? The deep go of the deep. The deep in me is calling for the deep. that something inside me, something inside me is calling for something somewhere. When an eagle calls, it will be eagles who are going to answer. Chickens will not answer. Ducks will not answer. If a heart calls, it's a kid who's going to answer. Everybody else is nonsense. &gt;&gt; Nonsense. &gt;&gt; That is why when the message of the hour came to call, some of us answered, some of people didn't know anything because the deep call to the deep. Who was calling? Why has he called us? Why have we been called? You are South African. &gt;&gt; You are Zian. &gt;&gt; You are. &gt;&gt; Why have you been called? Right? Why have you been called? Because we have to know why have we been called. So if you come to Romans 1:7, 1:7 Why have we been called? &gt;&gt; You are there my brother. Romans 1:57 to all that be in Rome. Beloved of God called to be saints. &gt;&gt; Called to be saints. What have we been called to be? The caller has called me &gt;&gt; to be a saint. Amen. Amen. He called me to be a saint. That's right. &gt;&gt; We have been called to be saints. &gt;&gt; He called us He justified us. He sanctified us and he gave us the gift of the Holy Ghost. None of that is the work of man. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know there can be an advocate in this country. The the South African army can say we need recruits. So they call all the people in South Africa and they very they are very very specific. We want people not not weak ones to become the army of South Africa. They don't just take everybody. They recruit people. H they gave them into the army. So you know sometimes uh people come into the army with their own clothes. No no no no. If you come to the army you have to wear the clothes of the army. You have to throw away your Gucci and the They give you a specific type of clothes you have to wear. Whether your father is rich or poor, they say here, there's no poor. There's no rich one for there's no nothing. Here we were only battle fatigues, combat gear. That's right. They don't have the physique. They train them. They give them good food so that they could have physique. If you start giving your army in combo today, the army will not fight. &gt;&gt; The army needs to be given food to make it strong to make their muscles grow. &gt;&gt; Brother says, Even if the word is true, &gt;&gt; the word is a sword. A sword &gt;&gt; is useless in a weak hand. Even if the word is so sharp, but the hand is weak, it will never cut. The hand is the sword is supposed to be held by a strong hand of faith. So that's why they take them down. Give me 50. They know even if I got good guns without muscles it was nothing. They don't have guns, they give to them. They don't have aircraft. They give it to them because the army has to fight in the air has to fight on land, has to fight in the seas, &gt;&gt; who gives them the one who called them. If your God who has called you is not giving you arament to win a battle against the miner because the battles which you are fighting your general &gt;&gt; is supposed to give you the equipment. If you're going to fight in the sea, your general should give you equipment to fight in the sea. Fight in the air. You are supposed to have equipment to fight in the air. If you're going to fight on land, you're supposed to have equipment to fight on land. Amen. Amen. We have called. &gt;&gt; We have been called. &gt;&gt; The caller is supposed to give us the equipment we need to fight this battle. &gt;&gt; We have been, we have been called. God cannot make a mistake in recruitment. &gt;&gt; God doesn't run a corrupt government like Malawi. Because if you run your recruitment by corruption, you're going to be in trouble. &gt;&gt; When you are recruiting somebody, make sure he's fit for the job. So he called us, he forneew us, he pred predestinated us. And 2 Corinthians 4:3 says, &gt;&gt; "But if our gospel, &gt;&gt; it is he, &gt;&gt; if is he, &gt;&gt; it is he to them that are lost, Our gospel is in the open. Even a fool cannot in it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Is everybody with me here? I can't hear amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's too slow. Too too long. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has called us. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me continue. &gt;&gt; He has done what? &gt;&gt; He has called us. &gt;&gt; I want to go further. &gt;&gt; Revelation 16. Revelation 1:6. &gt;&gt; He has called us religion. &gt;&gt; And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has called us. &gt;&gt; And he has even made us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey my brother, &gt;&gt; we are so favored. &gt;&gt; We have been called. We have been made. &gt;&gt; I'm leading a quote here. &gt;&gt; My brother here is my is a my witness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Problem says he has made us. &gt;&gt; Oh, there are certain truths we need to emphasize. This is one of them. He he has made us. &gt;&gt; Salvation is his doing. &gt;&gt; Salvation is of the Lord. All grace. He redeemed us for a purpose. &gt;&gt; He bought us for a purpose. We are kings. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; King Edar. &gt;&gt; Hey, please let's give you give each other please back here. What's my name? brothers. &gt;&gt; What's my name?

We are going to be kings upon earth with him. when he sits on his throne. But now we are spiritual kings. &gt;&gt; That's why you see I I walk like a king. You not see me at the bar because I'm a king. You you want a king to be at the bar. You know when kings we speak, we speak good. If I want to speak the the kings, let me speak the king's English. &gt;&gt; I want to I I do not want to be labor you to give me that bott of water.

Are you a king in the village? Can a king start a war in the village? &gt;&gt; Because you are a king. You are supposed to pissy people. Put the people's hearts down. &gt;&gt; We reign over a spiritual kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are kings. &gt;&gt; We have a spiritual kingdom. Of course, you cannot recognize me because we don't belong to the same kingdom. You know these people from Switzerland. If the king appeared here, the king of Swan appears here, you'd have heard Those [screaming] who from Malaw will never know what it is. It's only from they will know that the king is here. Who goes in front? The crier to tell everything what the king has done. All of us will be wondering what's happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we are of a different kingdom. They will never understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now. &gt;&gt; Right now. &gt;&gt; Right now. &gt;&gt; Right now, we reign with Christ having dominion over sin.

You find that he has made us kings. and made &gt;&gt; and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father. &gt;&gt; He has made us priests. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching here without going to a Bible school because I was favored to be given as a priest. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Unto him. offering spiritual praise of sanctified lips. Amen. Lips lips. &gt;&gt; You got so sharp lips. You you talk as if you're in parliament. Our lips are supposed to be sanctified. &gt;&gt; Our lips are supposed to talk the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our lips are not supposed to be benefiting us. &gt;&gt; They are sanctified. You know the problem with us now is that we got freedom and the west enemy of Christianity is human rights. Correct. &gt;&gt; You are taking human rights from the Freedom Charter of South Africa &gt;&gt; and bring it in the message &gt;&gt; and you just cut Sanctify the lips. Spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our pastor his life.

So who you and me who are busy trying to figure out how to make money out of this church. God bless you. The owner of the church has gone. &gt;&gt; The one who has this church has gone in you. &gt;&gt; You can live 50 years of the gospel without a Lamborghini. Hey my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That brother of mine &gt;&gt; lived a humble life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

He would travel from here to just to speak to one poor woman. He spent his life as a sweet offering unto me. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Interceding as a interced. Yeah. Yeah. Petitioning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Interceding is to pray for someone as if they were you. That's what the church of a living God supposed to do. Amen. Amen. Don't don't worry about going home. We are not going home today. [applause] Pastor Kodima is coming out of Mald Church at 11 at night because of you and you want to go home now. You can't even spend one night for him. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Pastor was coming late. Every every Sunday was coming late. &gt;&gt; Because of you. &gt;&gt; Today you want to go home today. Shame on you. The man was suffering for you. &gt;&gt; Always sleeping late, &gt;&gt; coming home late, interceding for you, &gt;&gt; petitioning for you. &gt;&gt; You can't just wait for him for just for one 24 hours. When did you last have an overnight, you people? Sorry. When did you have an overnight meeting? Overnight overnight prayer. &gt;&gt; Overnight meeting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The overnight is today.

Start from there. &gt;&gt; Interceding and petitioning priests and kings unto our God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. A peculiar people zeal us into unto good works. Hey. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you church. You are into good works. Hey. Amen. Elders of the north. God bless you. I saw the cow which came yesterday was a nice cow. And the good thing is you did that out of a good heart. You are zealous and good works. You see sisters cleaning. Let's continue on those because our pastor taught us how to be serious on good works. He was zealous into good works. Amen. We have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey my brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no better clust of people than you. God has a has a program. program, &gt;&gt; we must measure up to that program. &gt;&gt; The thing that I'm just saying, &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a program and we must measure up to that program. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if they recruit you as a soldier in the South African army, you are supposed to measure to a soldier of that level of calling. Brother, can you measure up to your calling now? elders, &gt;&gt; can you measure up to your calling? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what happens is this that good friends of mine who are airline pilots, they come from home, they go into an airplane, they start it, they fly. But if you go to the to the market, you find a guy there, everyone's going pirate, pirate, pilot, 7 out &gt;&gt; because he's smoking ga. &gt;&gt; He has never flown a plane. The &gt;&gt; only fl is in his mind. &gt;&gt; He has never even flown a plane. He doesn't even he doesn't even know enough physics to go into a brain. So when you are measured up, every son of God would be trained up to the measure of their calling. John the Baptist was trained to measure up his calling. Moses was trained to measure up to the God's program. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham was trained to measure up to the program which God was God is going to train you to measure up to the to the program which he has for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; We try to teach ministers knowledge. We want to teach them baptism of the Holy Ghost. We are a loyal priesthood, a holy nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are a holy nation. We are a new creation. God recreating himself because God wants to show himself in you. Amen. Wherever you are at. &gt;&gt; Hey my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey my brother. If you become super rich &gt;&gt; and you want to change a wife, you should know the program which God gave you and your measure. They're not they are different. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if God gives you something, he's supposed to immunize you. to make sure you are a soldier of that level. Amen. &gt;&gt; This church, &gt;&gt; brother was measured up to this church level of this church and he never failed. God when he calls you I I like those brothers uh you know a brother has received his pension &gt;&gt; and the revelation of the pension how to use the pension falls onto another brother say brother that patient of yours let's use it this way Tell him if God gave you me the patient, &gt;&gt; he should give me the leation to how to use the patient. Me, not to you. That's easy. Oh, don't worry. It's medical ter. It's fine. Okay. How do you have a revelation of a thing which doesn't belong to you? Every one of us, whatever we're going through, God gives us a revelation equal to what we are going through. this church, &gt;&gt; God has has has given you a a test here. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. We are now going to battle. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, God is very wonderful. He told you 32,000 people,000 Tell them. &gt;&gt; So they Gideon came up gentlemen, anybody who's got a new wife doesn't need to die in the battle, he can go back. Those that means those of us who have got old wives who need to die. Those those with new wives shouldn't die. So those with new wives went. He said he comes again. Gentlemen, if you have bought a new garden, please go back. People going back. That means those of us who have not good garden can die and when they were going they were saying brother you know I just bought that new garden in I don't know what how God works like God says no it's it's it's it's a uh there are too many Tell them to drink water. &gt;&gt; 32,000 people &gt;&gt; felt thirst at the same time and immediately there was a liver to drink from the 2,000 people feeling thirsty at the same time. The water is there. So he tells them &gt;&gt; go and drink. They went there. The majority of them were some were laughing. So he says those of you who kneel down go this way. So a lot of the big group went to that side. And a few people went to the lapping site. So the lapping site maybe the the kneing side was was shouting at the gro the rappers. You drink like a dog. &gt;&gt; They heard the announcement. says, "Those of you who knew go home, &gt;&gt; and only 300 remain." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he told them, &gt;&gt; what did he tell them? &gt;&gt; The sword of &gt;&gt; the sword of &gt;&gt; the sword of &gt;&gt; the sword of the Lord. The sword of Amen. Did he ask them a sword of Moses a sword of ar you know I want to be humble because if I can say myself my own name actually no maybe let's say the sort of He told him, "The sword of Gideon, the sword of the Lord." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your sword &gt;&gt; is a sword of &gt;&gt; the sword of is a sword of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the problem is on the moral. If you want to see go what God can do on the moral on the moral you are supposed to go and stand where the Lord stood tomorrow church tomorrow. If you want to see God here, if you want to see what God can do, on the moral. Go and stand where the Lord stood. &gt;&gt; Don't stand in your own position. Stand where the word stood. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm finishing right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the rising of the sun now. So it's another day we have done well. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So which way is your nature this morning? This morning. Just know this quotation knew that we're going to read it in the morning. &gt;&gt; Read it for them. It says this morning. So which way your nature is this morning? This morning &gt;&gt; are you a doubter? Because if you are a doubter, you would be a doubter there. I don't care how holy you are. How you live, how good you live, it wouldn't change one bit. You just change a dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother is here. &gt;&gt; One day I was called from Malawi. Now I said what? Then after thinking I said no I should go tied maybe to four or five machines. We sung it was in the ICU here. We s we sang. &gt;&gt; He was reading a songs. When machines attached to him, &gt;&gt; what is he doing now? &gt;&gt; He's singing. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; You just change dwelling places. &gt;&gt; Read for me, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Read for me. &gt;&gt; And if you can, okay, which way? If you wouldn't change one bit, you you you wouldn't change. Okay. It wouldn't change you one bit to die. Just your dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; It doesn't change you. &gt;&gt; Death doesn't change you. What changes your dwelling place? So, brother is as he is, a little bit younger. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He is the same. He is the same only that now he's around 25.

Father, we bow down our heads in reverence and in respect, thinking of Father, you before the foundation of the world, you chose a man. His parents named him Jacob. But before the foundation of the world, we had never named him Jacob. He used the name Jacob until a certain time until that name was changed and the ministry changed. Father, we are witnesses of the changing of that ministry. We bless your name, our God, the greatest expositor of the seventh seal. Father, we thank you so much. Ever since we heard this said news, Father, our hearts sank. But when your word is being preached, it elevates us to greater heights to deeper revelations [snorts] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We bless your name. It's been a long week.

Father Alicia followed Elijah until he received a double portion. Father, what a nice quotation. What is our measure? Father, you never made the mentally, Father. To fit Alicia, oh God, but you made it Alicia to fit in the mentally. &gt;&gt; That is our measure. We bless your name, our father. Bless all the organizers, Father. Everybody who has contributed physically, spiritually, some with their money, some with their time, Father, some they've missed their place of work just to be with the family. May you pour your blessings, oh God, we ask these things, receiving them by faith in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen.
