[21:12] everybody of what I'm waiting
[21:18] for amen okay so let's look at
[21:24] this we are going to look at the
[21:33] constellation okay
[21:36] amen constellation of
[21:39] the
[21:44] angels
[21:46] and yes constellation of the
[21:50] Angels I'm going to
[21:53] read from this book is this the time
[22:00] is this the
[22:01] time say is this the
[22:05] time you know when
[22:07] God sends a
[22:11] prophet
[22:13] because the true prophet of
[22:19] God is the main
[22:25] star you know in the book of
[22:30] uh okay let me turn to
[22:34] this in the
[22:36] Stars you have the main
[22:41] stars then around
[22:44] each there's a
[22:49] cluster of
[22:51] stars that's why God has seven main
[22:57] stars
[23:04] in Book of
[23:06] Genesis they were just called
[23:10] stars then when the Holy Ghost
[23:14] came they were called
[23:19] Apostles amen amen so
[23:22] now each of this
[23:26] star has a
[23:30] clust of the
[23:34] people Anointed with the same
[23:39] Spirit in order to serve God through
[23:42] that
[23:47] stuff without that you'll miss the
[23:54] point you can truly
[23:56] worship unless you find the place of
[24:03] worship am all right now H I'm going to
[24:09] read to
[24:11] you about the
[24:19] constellation I said to brother
[24:23] gab
[24:25] gab and then we have brother memes as
[24:29] you have
[24:32] seen they are in the
[24:38] constellation because when the word of
[24:40] God
[24:42] comes it comes into the
[24:48] constellation all right
[24:52] amen is
[24:55] uh it reflects
[25:01] Sons and Daughters of
[25:05] God now
[25:07] here there's a
[25:10] pyramid of
[25:13] men and there's a
[25:17] pyramid of
[25:21] angels now if you look in the
[25:24] Bible you find that the the first
[25:28] pyramid of
[25:32] Enoch Enoch was responsible for that
[25:40] pyramid
[25:42] why you know pyramid has
[25:45] seven
[25:50] steps why because
[25:54] Enoch is the seventh man
[25:59] amen from
[26:02] Adam and being the
[26:08] seventh that's why now we have
[26:12] seven
[26:15] pyramid he was responsible for that
[26:21] structure the seventh
[26:24] man responsible for the seven
[26:29] the the
[26:30] pyramid with seven steps to the
[26:37] king do you still remember getting into
[26:40] the king's
[26:45] CH and I read also that the bride of
[26:49] Christ is made like a
[26:56] pyramid is God's
[27:00] sign
[27:02] amen if you can
[27:06] notice all the way we've been having
[27:09] this
[27:14] sign our
[27:16] ministry has a sign it's a
[27:20] pyramid
[27:24] pyramid now so I I I will just read this
[27:30] part to
[27:32] show the first
[27:35] pyramid of
[27:36] Enoch the seventh man from
[27:42] Adam
[27:44] and the second
[27:47] pyramid is of the seventh angel
[27:53] messenger amen it runs to the end
[28:02] because it's a perfect
[28:09] St that's why you
[28:12] notice if the ministry is
[28:16] under H the guidance of
[28:22] God you see that sign you you will see
[28:26] that sign pyramid
[28:31] that's why we are having
[28:34] it all right amen now I read this
[28:40] part
[28:42] uh there was this
[28:44] pyramid of
[28:48] Enoch then after
[28:50] that there's a pyramid of
[28:56] angels
[28:58] amen and you know that will come to
[29:02] where do you still remember the the
[29:06] white white stone
[29:12] interpretation Stone interpretation
[29:19] amen if there's
[29:21] something maybe the brother is busy with
[29:26] something
[29:27] [Music]
[29:30] he can just on a piece of
[29:35] paper tell
[29:37] me that there's
[29:41] something
[29:44] okay
[29:45] H you know we were
[29:48] praying you were
[29:53] there when something on the
[29:56] roof
[29:58] was like people running
[30:02] away when we prayed
[30:06] there then I realized that we
[30:13] afterwards we were told
[30:16] that it's the people who actually were
[30:24] there but when we prayed today
[30:28] they ran
[30:29] [Music]
[30:31] away
[30:33] okay all right let's look at this for a
[30:36] few

[37:59] [Music]
[38:00] what way off into
[38:08] eternity the only way somebody can look
[38:11] into
[38:15] eternity it's only if he has eternal
[38:25] life then he can look into
[38:30] eternity you know if you look into
[38:35] eternity all the things of the

[40:36] last
[40:40] time did you know

[40:59] today is the one that even changed your
[41:03] [Music]
[41:09] see we are looking at things and see
[41:12] them
[41:19] different you
[41:21] know even your
[41:25] eyes

[53:16] [Music]
[53:19] messenger amen all right amen now let's
[53:23] take this part here
[53:27] uh of which we will it will help us to
[53:36] understand in the book here SE
[53:42] book I
[53:44] read this
[53:48] part okay uh the brothers a brother said
[53:54] brother he was somewhere they said Don't
[53:57] Preach deep things the people don't
[54:05] understand and he said they said we've
[54:08] got new people
[54:10] here now in Christ we don't have new
[54:16] people if you are called by
[54:19] God you are called to
[54:24] Eternity
[54:27] amen now let me take this
[54:32] part while he was looking
[54:37] again and while you are
[54:41] looking it
[54:44] says the Angels
[54:47] Came From the
[54:50] West sweeping forward with great
[54:53] terrific speed
[54:56] then he says they picked me
[54:59] up that was coming back
[55:04] East with the mystery of this seven
[55:11] series just like it said in junior
[55:15] Jackson's
[55:18] dream that the Lord let me interpret for
[55:24] him now on the inside of that
[55:28] pyramid there was a white
[55:33] stone that wasn't written
[55:37] on you know that white
[55:41] stone uh when they were asked to look
[55:50] inside they looked but there was no
[55:53] writing on there
[56:00] and it tells you that they started to
[56:03] live one by
[56:06] one some of
[56:08] them but some
[56:13] remain now these others they left
[56:16] because there was nothing written
[56:21] there then we look at some
[56:25] who remained looking at
[56:30] the because for them to
[56:35] remain they must have seen
[56:40] something that kept them
[56:43] there you know i' I said this time and
[56:47] again that I was with my
[56:52] brother-in-law then we were here here in
[56:56] town when we were looking at the
[57:00] DS they were H just jumping along the
[57:08] wall but they were looking like
[57:14] inside amen amen while walking
[57:19] around they sort of were seeing
[57:23] something
[57:26] then we decided to go near with my
[57:30] brother only to realize
[57:32] that uh is this
[57:38] D the
[57:41] wall there's water
[57:44] inside so these does were seeing
[57:50] themselves because it kept us uh
[57:57] guessing why these DS are looking
[58:01] into like seeing something down
[58:07] there when we arrive we realize that
[58:11] they were looking at
[58:15] themselves they could see themselves in
[58:18] the
[58:21] water as you know God made man in his
[58:29] own you come to
[58:31] Jesus when you see yourself in
[58:38] himen you know I will read this things
[58:41] time and
[58:44] again until
[58:47] then amen amen I'm going back to this
[58:52] again let me read it again
[58:56] maybe you'll
[58:59] remember okay this is power of
[59:04] transformation of transformation I
[59:10] repeat that's the way God did about the
[59:16] world he work it was in his
[59:20] mind he it was in his
[59:23] mind amen amen if you
[59:27] notice it come like by
[59:33] Evolution but it was not
[59:38] Evolution amen I found some
[59:44] boys shall I repeat it amen they were
[59:47] having the Readers
[59:50] Digest dig now I was called by my
[59:54] father-in
[59:56] saying come and help
[59:59] here he was standing with these four
[1:00:03] boys then when I got
[1:00:07] closer he said listen to this
[1:00:11] boys they were telling my father-in-law
[1:00:14] about
[1:00:17] Evolution that man was an ape he started
[1:00:21] being an
[1:00:23] ape
[1:00:27] then he
[1:00:32] evoluted to a man in
[1:00:38] suit and I said hey
[1:00:41] brothers do you believe
[1:00:43] God they said yes I said the Bible said
[1:00:49] God made men in his own
[1:00:53] image now you you say man was an
[1:00:58] A and what
[1:01:01] happened so they said no it is just
[1:01:07] a
[1:01:12] syllabus all right now the best thing go

[1:01:32] things fish and
[1:01:35] everything amen amen then something in

[1:01:53] image
[1:01:57] if if God make Made You In His
[1:02:01] Image then you will go after
[1:02:08] him if
[1:02:10] then because you are in His
[1:02:15] image he said let us make men in our
[1:02:23] image now here it says now
[1:02:29] God made something in his own
[1:02:36] image

[1:03:06] seen you know with me to be seen by God
[1:03:10] is
[1:03:13] [Applause]
[1:03:16] enough not by men you know when God made
[1:03:21] Adam he made him in his image
[1:03:25] so that every time when he looks at
[1:03:29] ad amen am he saw
[1:03:34] himself our God is
[1:03:37] wonderful let us make

[1:03:53] Christ
[1:03:57] but he wants to see
[1:04:05] himself you get what I mean amen that's
[1:04:08] why if you look at the fourth
[1:04:12] dimension Dimension it is
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:17] full because the people want to be
[1:04:21] seen they want at least to do something
[1:04:29] that's why you go to your
[1:04:34] screens you see someone also appearing
[1:04:38] just
[1:04:44] watching but a true
[1:04:47] Christian wants to be like his

[1:19:29] things that's it amen hold it just there
[1:19:34] now there's one part
[1:19:37] here
[1:19:41] H
[1:19:42] Satan will try to
[1:19:50] impersonate but there's one thing he
[1:19:53] cannot
[1:19:57] impersonate there'll be no mimics to
[1:20:01] this because he don't know
[1:20:09] it
[1:20:12] Satan he cannot
[1:20:15] impersonate the message that we
[1:20:21] preach because
[1:20:23] he doesn't
[1:20:28] know God was supposed to make us
[1:20:34] different we can't do a thing that Satan
[1:20:37] can also
[1:20:41] do we a
[1:20:45] Ministry amen special
[1:20:48] Ministry known only to the sons and
[1:20:51] daughters
[1:20:54] [Applause]
[1:20:57] okay amen s will try to
[1:21:05] impersonate like if I
[1:21:08] say God he also can
[1:21:13] say but he ends up right
[1:21:20] there if I say Jesus
[1:21:24] is
[1:21:25] Lord he Al and
[1:21:28] Oma Satan can also say
[1:21:33] Jesus but he can't say he is
[1:21:41] Lord he will put another type of God
[1:21:48] there Satan wants the people to
[1:21:51] worship
[1:21:53] but not to worship
[1:21:58] God that's why you have the the the
[1:22:03] world is littered with some types of
[1:22:12] gods because
[1:22:14] Satan wants the people to
[1:22:17] worship but not to worship
[1:22:21] God
[1:22:24] all right
[1:22:25] amen is
[1:22:28] then if you talk about the ministry of
[1:22:34] God it
[1:22:36] says it started Beyond
[1:22:42] Time the ministry of God started Beyond
[1:22:48] Time and the minister of Satan came
[1:22:56] after you see now I read to you
[1:23:01] this Satan will try to
[1:23:07] impersonate everything that the church
[1:23:09] will
[1:23:11] do as it says in the last
[1:23:15] days many false
[1:23:18] prophets shall come and so
[1:23:21] for amen they shall perform
[1:23:24] Miracles
[1:23:26] wonders in so much if it were
[1:23:29] possible they would deceive even the
[1:23:32] very
[1:23:36] elect but it is
[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:43] impossible that's
[1:23:45] why if God has called
[1:23:51] you then you have the mind of
[1:23:56] Christ the Bible says
[1:23:58] so the mind of
[1:24:01] Christ if Christ cannot be
[1:24:05] deceived you cannot be
[1:24:11] deceived if Christ is
[1:24:14] Holy you live a holy
[1:24:19] life amen now let me read this
[1:24:24] party this is one thing he cannot
[1:24:30] impersonate there will be mimics to
[1:24:34] this but no no way for him to
[1:24:41] know the third
[1:24:47] pool amen
[1:24:50] amen but
[1:24:54] let me come back
[1:24:56] there I'm going to read something in
[1:24:59] closing
[1:25:03] here where is this ministry
[1:25:07] from now sometimes you we must
[1:25:12] check you you must yourself
[1:25:15] check if you are in the ministry of
[1:25:20] God you must check
[1:25:23] where is this ministry
[1:25:31] from they will tell

[1:26:03] started but there is no starting
[1:26:09] point
[1:26:11] amen amen amen you know to have eternal
[1:26:16] life it means you had no starting
[1:26:21] point
[1:26:25] that's why you have eternal
[1:26:27] life because eternal life has got no
[1:26:35] roots it's God
[1:26:37] himself that is eternal
[1:26:40] life now let me read you something I
[1:26:43] want to close

[1:31:50] man what God puts in
[1:31:56] US calling for the
[1:32:01] predestin amen amen
[1:32:04] amen you know you can't force somebody
[1:32:07] to believe
[1:32:10] God if he believes it is because he
[1:32:16] was his name was
[1:32:19] written in the book of
[1:32:22] the
[1:32:26] LI
[1:32:30] otherwise you'll testify to him until

[1:36:02] was seemed
[1:36:07] ordinary but this
[1:36:09] Angel was a noted
[1:36:14] angel
[1:36:16] now let's finish with this H it says
[1:36:24] now to bring them under the new
[1:36:30] commission he brought the message to the
[1:36:34] church after he connected an
[1:36:39] angel amen you see the
[1:36:44] difference under the

[1:36:56] church with the
[1:36:59] message from the
[1:37:02] angel all right all right all

[1:37:50] one
[1:37:52] Ang he was to my
[1:37:56] left in the
[1:37:59] constellation in the form of
[1:38:04] pyramid you know the message must bring
[1:38:07] you to
[1:38:13] this then it
[1:38:17] says remember it was in the pyramid
[1:38:22] where the mysterious White Rock was not
[1:38:25] written
[1:38:30] on and the angels took me into that
[1:38:34] pyramid of
[1:38:40] themselves let me go back a
[1:38:44] bit that
[1:38:46] stone the white
[1:38:50] stone
[1:38:52] when they
[1:38:53] were looking

[1:39:42] anything he will remain
[1:39:48] standing the people who have seen the
[1:39:50] message
[1:39:52] and the core of the
[1:39:55] message they are not toast
[1:40:03] about
[1:40:06] no they know they
[1:40:11] believed is that
[1:40:14] right Peter
[1:40:17] Pedro why did you you go with other

[1:40:40] gospel the
[1:40:42] words of eternal
[1:40:46] life not just the
[1:40:48] way it should be the way of
[1:40:56] this is the ministry I believe

[1:42:11] recently we understood that brother
[1:42:15] gabrielson brother

[1:42:30] somewhere he will realize that brother
[1:42:36] gabri has seen
[1:42:42] that then I
[1:42:44] said it is because he is in the
[1:42:49] constellation
