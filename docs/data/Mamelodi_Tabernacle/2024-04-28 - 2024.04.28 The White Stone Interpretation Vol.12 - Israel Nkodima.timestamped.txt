[19:14] Father looking back father where we come

[19:22] understanding of where we
[19:25] are and also Lord the revelation of
[19:29] where we are
[19:30] going when we think Lord
[19:34] Almighty through the
[19:37] anointing of the place that you have
[19:39] prepared for
[19:41] us father it's beyond our thought
[19:45] Lord because when we look at that place
[19:49] Lord through the spiritual Eyes
[19:53] Lord there's anointing Lord Almighty in
[19:57] our lives
[20:00] that you really loved us
[20:02] Lord there's nothing good that you have
[20:05] given us either than Lord Almighty
[20:08] giving that inheritance hallah to things
[20:11] Lord Almighty that
[20:13] we are shareholders of that inheritance
[20:18] Lord heavenly father thank you
[20:22] Lord we remember and Lord Almighty and
[20:25] we have the
[20:27] Revelation that
[20:29] gracious
[20:31] Lord you had us in
[20:35] mind before the foundation of the world
[20:38] Hallelujah and now Lord
[20:42] Almighty you took the
[20:45] prophet and send him westwards Lord to
[20:49] connect with our inheritance
[20:52] Lord and when he came back Lord
[20:56] Almighty he had that inheritance
[20:59] Lord within
[21:00] him and father through anointing and
[21:05] Revelation he said that the uh The
[21:09] Inheritance
[21:10] now is with the pastors
[21:13] [Music]
[21:15] Lord that will give us our position
[21:18] which is the inheritance Lord
[21:21] Almighty like Joshua's Lord Almighty and
[21:25] your
[21:26] word teaches us that we need to pray for
[21:29] them for they look after our souls Lord
[21:34] Almighty and father we are praying now
[21:37] for them Lord
[21:39] Almighty that as we are in the ministry
[21:43] that is
[21:45] relevant to the time that we are living
[21:47] in
[21:48] Lord and the relevancy Lord Almighty is
[21:53] that
[21:55] is according to Roman 8:
[21:59] 19 where it speaks about the the
[22:02] manifestations of the sons of God that
[22:06] is happening during our
[22:08] time Father Here we are
[22:11] gathered as the
[22:13] church as the bride Lord
[22:17] Almighty with all the power that you had
[22:21] yes Father you've given you've given us
[22:23] that power and that power is the power
[22:27] of the third pool
[22:29] because it's the revelation of the
[22:31] seventh seal father we don't doubt
[22:34] us we know that Lord
[22:37] Almighty as we are praying right now
[22:40] with our heads

[23:01] fashion and fellowshipping with thee

[53:15] I'm I'm in the
[53:18] [Music]
[53:19] shoes of my
[53:23] pastor what I'm going to do here
[53:27] is is done by the
[53:31] pastor you must say past
[53:36] isting their
[53:46] baby I don't want to change what the
[53:48] Bible has said
[53:51] here can you read it myk
[53:57] 10 from verse 13 it
[54:01] says and they brought young children to
[54:04] him that he should touch them and his
[54:07] disciples rebuked those that brought
[54:09] them but when Jesus saw it he was much
[54:13] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[54:16] little children to come unto me and
[54:18] forbid them not for of such is the
[54:21] kingdom of God verily I say unto you
[54:24] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[54:27] of God as a little child he shall not
[54:30] enter therein and he took them up in his
[54:33] arms put his hands upon them and bless
[54:37] them amen I
[54:39] believe these
[54:43] women they've seen something in the man
[54:49] Jesus and they believed that
[54:52] thing they believed that thing
[54:56] you that if you can take our children to
[54:59] that
[55:02] man they will never just
[55:05] come they will come with
[55:09] something if that man can touch
[55:13] them something will happen to our
[55:17] children they didn't just take their
[55:19] children there it was not a
[55:22] tradition just like us here but that was
[55:26] not their
[55:28] tradition they were bringing their
[55:30] children
[55:32] there having faith in
[55:35] them that something is going to happen
[55:37] to the
[55:39] children I believe the same
[55:42] thing this two family this
[55:46] family has detected
[55:52] something that if they can just bring
[55:55] this child to
[55:58] and if the pastor can just touch the
[56:01] CH something will happen to the
[56:05] child they didn't bring their child here
[56:07] for
[56:10] tradition it's something that they
[56:14] believe give the child to the mother
[56:20] [Music]
[56:30] what is the name of
[56:35] the
[56:37] amen thank you very
[56:40] much I'm here in my
[56:44] hands believing that this the hand
[56:50] of are used today by
[56:54] Jesus is Christ
[56:57] who is holding this child

[57:06] Eyes my

[2:22:05] M you know I don't need money to enter
[2:22:13] Heaven but some people looks
[2:22:17] like their salvation
[2:22:20] is based on
[2:22:23] that for them to
[2:22:25] enter they need money a lot
[2:22:32] of many lovers the Bible says the
[2:22:38] root of all
[2:22:41] EV the love of
[2:22:45] money is the
[2:22:48] root now the root
[2:22:52] is the life of a
[2:22:58] tree a tree for a tree to
[2:23:03] live and even to resurrect again next
[2:23:08] summer what you call

[2:23:14] a
[2:23:16] me uhhuh amen now joh

[2:23:22] root in your
[2:23:25] heart is
[2:23:28] [Music]
[2:23:29] [Applause]
[2:23:31] Christ let's go back to that scripture
[2:23:33] I'm
[2:23:35] closing Ephesians chapter 4
[2:23:38] again yes amen and grieve not the holy
[2:23:42] spirit of
[2:23:43] God whereby ye are sealed unto the day
[2:23:46] of redemption amen
[2:23:53] is that the
[2:23:57] Ephesians
[2:24:00] 430 read it again and grieve not the
[2:24:04] holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed
[2:24:08] unto the day of
[2:24:09] redemption
[2:24:11] now that's why brother
[2:24:15] says which we will read remind me next
[2:24:21] if I don't read that
[2:24:23] part where he says he speaks of the
[2:24:28] mystery
[2:24:32] beneath this seventh
[2:24:37] SE
[2:24:39] amen he says when that seventh seal is
[2:24:46] revealed it shows a great mystery
[2:24:56] now some people think that for a
[2:25:01] mystery you've got to read too much and
[2:25:06] read no no
[2:25:08] no no no no
[2:25:10] no the greatest mystery of them
[2:25:15] all is to know him
[2:25:25] now we even after here
[2:25:29] Serv I'll talk with you about it in the
[2:25:34] office there's only one
[2:25:37] miss the seventh
[2:25:42] seal it
[2:25:46] holds the whole plan of Eternity
[2:25:51] the plan of
[2:25:53] God if it is revealed to
[2:25:56] you then you know that the whole plan of
[2:26:01] God is been revealed to
[2:26:05] you he said shall I hide from
[2:26:09] Abraham the thing knowing
[2:26:12] that because he couldn't hide from
[2:26:15] Abraham because Abraham was P part of
[2:26:20] the
[2:26:23] Myst so he won't hide it from
[2:26:26] you because you are
[2:26:29] part of the
[2:26:32] mystery so when the Mysteries are
[2:26:36] revealed you are also being revealed
[2:26:40] Hallelujah
[2:26:41] [Applause]
[2:26:44] am brother when the mystery is
[2:26:47] revealed you are also
[2:26:51] when the Mysteries
[2:26:53] revealed you know why I'm with Pastor
[2:26:57] Mak because I walk with the
[2:27:01] people who were
[2:27:06] revealed who God has
[2:27:10] revealed because a person who is not
[2:27:13] revealed can say Amen to
[2:27:16] you and the next day he says
[2:27:21] to
[2:27:24] you and you will ask yourself whatever I
[2:27:29] done because this man we were together I
[2:27:34] baptize him I introduce to him the
[2:27:37] message but tomorrow he's
[2:27:41] against the thing is you didn't come
[2:27:45] from the same
[2:27:47] place you and that person
[2:27:51] those who came from the same
[2:27:54] place they will meet in the same
[2:27:59] place now the seven
[2:28:02] seal is the same
[2:28:07] place what does what the book
[2:28:13] says yes sir yes sir and grieve not the
[2:28:17] holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed

[2:29:06] revealed it reveals the
[2:29:09] people
[2:29:11] who whose names are in that
[2:29:17] book but with these people when they are
[2:29:21] revealed they know nothing

[2:29:27] Christ if you know Christ you'll know
[2:29:32] me if I know Christ then I know you
[2:29:37] because all those who are in
[2:29:40] Christ when the book is open it reveals
