Description:
Title: The Second Coming of the Lord Vol 3

Text: The Rapture

Preached By Pastor Erastus Makuwa at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 01 December 2024.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

1 Thessalonians 4: 16-18 | 1 Thessalonians 5: 1-5 | Matthew 8: 11-12 | Matthew 27: 53 |

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the second coming of the Lord

The children of God must know who they are, where they are, where they come from and where they are going.

It is God who must make you to know these things and He will do it through the pastors.

There will be few that will be raptured, some will remain, and some have been blinded by falls teachers.

The message today is not about leaving this and that, because we have left all those long times back. The message today is to know the signs of what will happen. We know what rapture is and we know how it will happen.

A denomination is a group of people without a revelation.

We are not children of darkness, but we are children of light. We need to shine our light where we are. You cannot be light if you have not received light. You must receive light and then you become a child of light.

A shout is a message calling the bride together for the rapture. Because rapture is only for the bride. We are living in the bride age and that is the rapture aeroplane. It is impossible to be in the bride age and be left behind in the rapture.

The bride is called by a certain channel known only by the bride. Where the carcass is there the eagle will gather. The carcass is the word, and we are feasting on the body word of the son of man. There must be a pastor who is bringing that carcass to you.

The shout gathers those that are living and the voice calls those that are asleep to come out. The voice is the voice of resurrection. We meet one another first before we meet Him.

We gather in the word not in a certain place. And those who resurrect will resurrect and be together in the word.

my pastor here I welcome you and I'm happy to to see you [Music] here and I I believe God will bless you with what he's going to bless us let's read the book of Thessalonians chapter 4: 16 to um to 18 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the CLS to me the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with his amen read Thessalonians chapter 5 there 5 read from verse 1 to 5 but of the times and the seasons Brethren ye have no need that I write unto you for yourself know perfectly that the day of the Lord Soul cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as Trav upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness am am can we can you take your seats while you are taking your seats you can open the book of Matthews chapter 8 we read from verse 11 to 12 11 to 12 and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into alter Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of Teeth Let's lose our eyes our father thank you for this privilege which you have privileged me with bless me bless my brother next to me bless the church amen use my voice and the interpreters Voice open the ears of your children Amen to hear what you want to give to tell them this morning amen I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you um we together with my pastor we said one of us will go on and in the morning said you are the one to go then I'm happy you say if you are an obedient child when your father says you say and you you you you rise up fast and you go this what I'm doing I and [Music] Elder when the pastor say something we and we just stand up God bless you um we are going to uh go on with that topic the second coming his second coming the Rapture you see um it's important I'm not going to preach a nice message I'm not going to preach a rough message but what we as the children of God and we as Pastors in the message we must be used by him because the children of God must know who they are that is the main thing and they must know where they come from and they must know where they are and they must know where they are going where I have read Thessalonians chapter 5 it says but the times and the season he have no need that I Rite to you in other words you know them who must make you to know them he himself but he must make you to know them through pastor you must not be ignorant of those things you must know he says in verse two for yourself know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night and verse three said for for when they shall say peace and safety then suddenly destruction cometh upon them as a as travail upon a woman with a child and they shall not Escape he says they amen not us because we know but they don't know he says verse four but de Brethren are not in darkness you Breen you sisters you are not in they are in darkness but you are not in darkness this will never happen as a thief to you because you have knowledge that is what you are here for to give you knowledge because they don't know but you must know but de Brethren are not in [Music] darkness that they should overtake you as a thief do you understand it will fall on them as a thief but not you you see there are people there are there will be few who will be raptured very few and there will be some who will remain but but some are blinded by false [Music] teachers as as we have got true teachers we have got false teachers as we have got true pastors we have got false you see somebody he is has been blinded just like Israel Israel was blinded by God himself do you know that they are even now they're still waiting for theiah they still waiting for Malachi 3:1 to be fulfilled in his thir coming they will think it is his first coming because they were blinded when they were saying crucify him they were blinded there are people in our days who are blinded what kind of teaching do you get because the teaching you are getting it can blind you see they were the Pharisees they were teaching them about the coming Messiah quoting scriptures that he is coming coming to his Temple but conceived because they were blinded they couldn't see that this is what the scriptures only a few who were PR Destin could see even now people will C Malachi chapter 4 we qu our Prophet but by being that they will blind [Music] others are you listening because if you don't know who you are the message you have to receive then you are in a terrible condition this message is not leave this that or the other this message is not leave this that or because you have already left them long ago now you are where you must know their signs what will happen he says ye are all the children of light verse five and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness in other words we know what the Rapture is we know how it will happen some they just say they are waiting for in denominational denominations they said they're waiting for artion you know what the denomination is some believes that the denomination is Catholic church or Presbyterian or a denomination denomination is a group of people who are without the revelation that group whether they can say they believe the prophet or as long as they like the Revelation they operate outside the Revelation then they are a denomination denomination because the denomination is where you come together you try to collect to put yourself together and you use your own ideas a certain man was trying to tell me about something I said where do you get it he said according to me said no when is according to you but if you can say the Bible says or the prophet says then I will then I will try to read where you say you so that I can see whether I where I've come wrong but when you say according to me that is aomination amen this is not according to me is according to what the prophet said what the Bible says we are not the children of Darkness we are the children of light we are light that's why we shine where we are you we are light because we have received light you cannot try to be light if you have not received light even if you try you will never be light because you must receive that light then you will be light then you become the Child of Light let me read here he says here we have read it he said the Lord himself when he's descending he's descending with three things shout voice trumpet then what let me let's start with this shout this shout is a message calling the bride to together are you listening not calling people together but calling their bride together for the Rapture that is the shout and when when it is calling the people together because the Rapture is only for the bright it's not for other people you see I will tell you it says we have moved from Pentecostal age is where we have read he said now let me read in the middle first we are not living in the Methodist age the Baptist age we are living in the bright age in other words the age we are living in is the bright age that bright age it is a rupture aane and when you are in the bright age you are inside the AE you know the the shout is calling you is impossible to be a member of the Bride to be in the bright age but be left behind by The Rapture that is impossible if you are if you'll be left behind you are not in the bright you say you are but you are not because if you are there you'll never be left behind he says we are in the bright Age The Calling bring back to God through a channel that is promised to bring back in you other words the bright the bright is called by a certain Channel and that channel is known only by the bride just like that story of that EET it was that iglet only that could hear the voice of its mother that that is a special voice it was a special voice only only meant for thatl that when that voice echoed voice that e start to wonder what is happening but the chickens were there they didn't worry about the voice The Voice might have terrorized them this what is happening sometimes when you talk about the underworld ter something but according to the prophet he says this is the third pool because the third pool of Jesus it is when he preached to the soul that were in prison which cannot be saved anymore the third pool of Noah it was when Noah was inside and the AR was closed no one could caner in you see those men who were in prison there who Jesus went to testify to they say they were preachers during Noah's time they were trying to tell people that Noah is right but the way he's building the ark it's just out of mind they were preaching they they the prophet says they denied the Covenant vow the Covenant vow was the message of Noah to deny that it was denying what God Said bringing the bride in a channel the shout he said we are not living in Pentecostal age we are living in another age you are not living in a Methodist age we are living in another age we are living up here to the bright age the calling out of the church getting it together for the Rapture this message was calling certain group of people are you together but it was not this this one only because each age it has its own elect you see this Aeroplane of ours the Aeroplane Rapture it started in the Old Testament taking people people getting inside but when it comes to our us the Gentiles it started with the the first church it was the first station in other words in during our gentle dispensation it had seven [Music] stations in each station station it was taking the members the elected ones pass of the Bride in that aane the Rapture started there going up in each age they were elect elect of God who were Tak into that a until it comes to our age this is the bright age that age that we are living in now to my honest opinion that is exactly the truth that is what the prophet says it is it is the the we the seat H we shall come back to that God willing then in this bright age there is the Bible says the will why because he says where there is a Cass the Eagles will [Music] gather then when we want to know what is the ccass the prophet says the ccass is the word of the season is the man it's the hidden man because Mana must be fresh it must not for last day or whatever it must be fresh where the carcass is the Eagles gather there we we are bound together because the Cass is there and then the prophet says then we are feeding feeding on the Cass we are invited to come and eat so that we can get power to fly he said we are feeding on the body word of the son of man which is our [Music] he says here if you haven't F fully on every word to give yourself strength to Fly Above All these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it we pray identify the Cass you cannot identify the C if there is no teacher there must be a teacher who is bringing that Cass you can't just say I'm eating the Cass if you have not identified the true teacher who is giving you that [Music] Cass are you together with me I want to read something for you that you must hear that is the prophet he says now the coming is so imminent in the book Oneness the second coming of Jesus is gathering is elected together I believe they come from east west where the Cass is the Eagles will get oh my what is it is God his Oneness showing himself among them do you understand what he say he calling his elected together in Oneness with himself with the same kind of ministry he had you know I sh I you know I shaped in the church ages not long ago about the big tower that was built called the pyramid but the headstone was never put on it remember how the Lutheran came the in minority then down to the Pentecost now what what is he doing calling from that he he called out the elect [Music] to make the lutherans he called out the elect out of the Lutheran to make the W he called out the elect out of that to make the Pentecostal now he is calling the elect from the Pentecostals to make the headstone to come into it when it comes to that the prophet said this one I don't know let me go to the west but remain looking inside he said they went West to get the the mystery of this one White Stone when he was coming back there he was bringing the headstone The Headstone [Music] Ministry are you to together the when when the message go out of West West W from the West Church those who remain there they're eating a rotten thing they are called the vultures because the weight has moved when the word moves there when you remain there you become a vulture what is it with God sent teacher they will stay right with the word to the real church not move one other no matter what an organization says they are not connected with it not make belief but genuine Prophet with the Lord he has placed with them true teacher through prophets who stay with the word who stay with the Bible my sheep hear my voice she said Jesus if that was his voice then hey are you together if it was his voice it must be his voice now we don't have a pastor a pastor is Jesus himself but if we see Jesus in a man we said that is a [Applause] pastor that's why he says he placed them with true teachers so that they can get the weight so that they can get this Cass so that they can be fat so that they can get power if that was his voice then is this voice now anything contr to that voice anything contrary to that voice is not sheep's foot and they won't follow it amen it is what he is feeding them so that they can receive power to fly now it is the seed age seed has become seed again what do we need because when you are sewing the seat you take care of it you water it when it has reached maturity you stop watering you don't need da anymore during seven church it was the this the Son of God the Holy Spirit watering it was water watering but at the end there we get to the seat again we don't need water there is another dispensation the anointing it's just like the anointing at Jordan we are anointed by [Music] himself we we have receive the owner of the gifts The Giver of the gifts we don't need any gift now because we have received the giver when you need orange you must plant orange tree then you'll have then now the anointing is that of start of the Loos amen he the prophet says now he says I am hearing something the coming of the cumbine the harves but I'm hearing it is coming is said the harves machine hey don't forget I'm talking about Rapture the harest machine is after harvesting then the elevator will take place to pick up let me just read something um in this book here I'm not going to be long as you know it says page 8 mod events 44 he says here the Shar held it but now the Shar pulls away it has remember 20 years has passed no more denomination has come out of it and he don't we are at the end of denominations denomination it doesn't mean people will never make denomination but he's talking to the bright the Rapture the Rapture material they will they will never make denomination when a person moves from another Pastor to to form a p that's those we don't talk about those things you see you have to humble yourself if you don't humble yourself do you want somebody to Humble to himself to [Music] you whom are you going to teach you refuse to be taught then you want to teach something what what do you need all right let's go on he says I say there's no time for denomination the wheat has taken shape but what the matter with the weat now it must lay in the presence of the sun to ripen before the combine picks it up now the event that was taking place is is absolutely showed in the Bible of every age he says now I'm hearing something here let me read what he's hearing he says I'm hearing something coming it's coming and when it is coming it means time is no more you see the combine combine is the World Council of churches [Music] he says so the prophet says so he says he's going to shave it away it's going to take it out from the he says but thank God the grain is going on then if that is true by the word of God to where we are living that is true by nature is indicated the corn of whe everywhere how much longer we got you know what I hear the coming of the kumb the world canel she will separate in other words this kumb will separate the Shar the the wheat from the Shar she will separate it what does she do shape her off the stock but she is she's got an elevator waiting for her she will go home after she is shaven then she the weed will be placed in the elevator and the elevator will take it home which is the rapture are you together with he says she will go home one of this money yes you understand say Amen amen that is what the prophet is saying he says he will shave it the wheat is here thank be to God the wheat is here but I'm hearing the the sound of a kumbai the harvesting machine what is that harvesting machine we have said this the world CC [Music] church here he says now remember there will be never an impersonation of that because it can't see it cannot be now it is inexistent he's talking about the thir and I and I am war of this right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this cancel begins to tighten when it does when does the pcal and so for in other words when they start to TI in he said but when that time comes when that squeeze comes down then you will see what you temporarily manifested in the fullness of his he say see four times in other words you see sometimes the squee brings something perfect bring something important if you want the the juice in the orange you have to squeeze it then when you squeeze it it will bring its juice during the squeeze then you will see what you have seen temporarily that is this squeeze it will be brought by the World Council of churches it is a tiing then when that time comes then that and the Press comes to a place where you are pressed out then watch what I am fixing to tell you in a few minutes wash the thir pool see it will be absolutely the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church that will be the tightening it will be the squeeze that squeeze it will be the harvesting Mach I'm not talking about that today I will talk about not soon not but we my my elders has talked about it the squeeze but let me say something he says it is already been formed this combine the harest Mach he say it has already been formed they are just waiting for the government what is remaining for them is to ask the government to ask the government to form a law which will force all to belong to it you see during Jesus time the the church people they hated him they wanted to do away with him but they didn't know how to do until they take him to the government so that the government can do away with him it will happen again the the the church people they are getting together they are they don't love us but they will make a [Applause] law but when those things happen it you must be happy because they are taking you to where you belong let me let me read my brother he says yeah he says this verse is not a declaration that the true church will go in will go in or through tribulation if it meant that it would have said that but it said I will keep thee from the hour of Temptation this temptation is exactly like the Temptation in Eden it will be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's command but it will be inviting exactly amen and yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it will be so very right so enlightening and giving life as to full the well only the very elect will not be fooled the Temptation will come as follows the economical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ prayer that we all might be one become so strong politically that she best pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or in dire or through adherence to principles ined into the law so that no person will be recognized as an actual Church unless unless unless under Direct in direct domination of this C it is for me with this great power the church system will persecute the true the true bride this image will try to keep the bride from preaching [Music] and teaching Etc her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and true to the people who need it but before the Antichrist in person Tak over this complete wealth system of of churches the true church will be taken away amen from this world to be with the Lord God will catch away his bride from for the great merriage supper of the Lamb this will be the squeeze when you are squeezed out you be you will be squeezed [Applause] out don't worry about those things the National Force National Force put the church in the world Cil of churches but the power of God will put the bright in a place that is the [Music] elevator the shout gathers together those who are living the voice calls for those who are asleep to come out the shout gathers together who those who are living then the voice is the voice of Resurrection is doing something to those who are asleep is calling them
