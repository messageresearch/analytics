[1:00:15] Revelation is when we
[1:00:17] close amen amen Genesis 3:
[1:00:22] 24 so he drove out the men and he placed
[1:00:26] at the east of the G Garden of Eden
[1:00:29] cherubims and a flaming sord which
[1:00:32] turned every way to keep the way of the
[1:00:35] tree of
[1:00:36] life amen amen you may be
[1:00:43] seated I think I gave you the resolution
[1:00:46] for the
[1:00:49] day that when we read
[1:00:52] Genesis will be closing
[1:00:57] amen amen as H you know another old
[1:01:01] man was asking one of the
[1:01:06] preachers one of the mighty
[1:01:09] preachers he asked him a question and
[1:01:13] say
[1:01:15] when you how do we know that you are
[1:01:18] coming to the end of your
[1:01:23] seron and the preacher said
[1:01:27] when I'm sending behind the
[1:01:29] pulpit I will preach and go on and
[1:01:33] on when I start to feel my feet becoming
[1:01:39] hot I know I must
[1:01:43] stop hey the feet were not going
[1:01:47] hot they were forever
[1:01:51] cold and the old man
[1:01:53] was we need to have a prayer for his
[1:01:56] feet to
[1:01:58] become because the service is going on
[1:02:01] and
[1:02:02] on so this morning when I read the book
[1:02:06] of
[1:02:07] Revelation you know we about to
[1:02:11] close amen amen so that is the uh
[1:02:15] conclusion of our today
[1:02:17] message we want to thank God for
[1:02:20] everything we want to thank God for
[1:02:22] everything you are being this morning
[1:02:26] the was on the other side of limo
[1:02:30] in we thank God for everything God has
[1:02:34] did that
[1:02:36] side this morning we'll be listening to
[1:02:39] the word of God as
[1:02:41] well uh I just want to tell you again
[1:02:44] this
[1:02:45] morning pray for our brothers in
[1:02:50] L went that
[1:02:52] side the children of God from masu
[1:02:58] moru and
[1:03:00] mor they are now having services in the
[1:03:03] place
[1:03:05] called so I've heard that they came in
[1:03:09] numbers the people around the
[1:03:12] village so keep them in their

[1:03:19] that
[1:03:21] side amen amen so this morning I I want
[1:03:26] to share with you about this
[1:03:29] title accessing the right to the tree of
[1:03:37] life amen because for many years you're
[1:03:41] quite right amen for many years we were
[1:03:44] not
[1:03:45] allowed to go back
[1:03:48] there but we need to
[1:03:51] check how we can have that access
[1:03:57] because since
[1:03:59] then Adam and Eve were chased out of the
[1:04:03] Garden of
[1:04:05] Eden and we see the
[1:04:08] Sal the Flaming
[1:04:10] Sal closing the
[1:04:13] gate to the tree of
[1:04:16] life that's my
[1:04:19] introduction that's my
[1:04:21] resolution so I'm going to present this
[1:04:24] message
[1:04:26] in this morning as uh like a
[1:04:29] novel how they write a novel they will
[1:04:33] tell you about the
[1:04:36] exposition and then they will tell you
[1:04:38] about the ascending
[1:04:40] action they will tell you about the Apex
[1:04:43] being the
[1:04:45] climax and then you will go to the
[1:04:48] descending
[1:04:51] action until you get to the resolution
[1:04:55] so our you
[1:04:58] know Exposition scripture is the one we
[1:05:01] just
[1:05:03] read the Resolute one will be the Book
[1:05:06] of
[1:05:08] Revelation and then we close the service
[1:05:11] I'm going to be very much
[1:05:13] brief straight to the
[1:05:16] point let's just go
[1:05:18] together amen amen well I'm going to
[1:05:22] read a quote from Brother Bram
[1:05:26] he was praying he even said let's bow
[1:05:29] our head everywhere and
[1:05:31] pray this spoken way in this spoken word
[1:05:36] I was not
[1:05:38] disobedient to the heavenly vision then
[1:05:42] let me read brother Bram says father who
[1:05:46] brought again the Lord Jesus Christ to
[1:05:51] life though old world seems to be
[1:05:54] modernistic
[1:05:58] and they are
[1:05:59] going they're going
[1:06:02] lot they are going
[1:06:05] l h to
[1:06:08] knowledge in instead of just a simple
[1:06:11] faith in
[1:06:15] God we realize that in the gardien of
[1:06:18] Eden when they tasted the tree of
[1:06:23] knowledge they broke of relationship
[1:06:26] with the tree of
[1:06:31] life since
[1:06:32] then man has went after
[1:06:37] knowledge and Destroy
[1:06:40] himself every time he bites from the
[1:06:46] tree the gun
[1:06:52] Powers the gun oh the G gunpowder situn
[1:06:58] ohun Auto the auto and now an atomic
[1:07:04] bomb knowledge and the knowledge truly
[1:07:08] the Prophet Daniel
[1:07:11] said they will run to and
[1:07:13] through and the knowledge shall
[1:07:18] increase God put Adam and
[1:07:21] Eve in the Garden of Eden and in the
[1:07:24] Garden of Eden
[1:07:26] they have a control over
[1:07:28] everything now when they have a control
[1:07:30] over everything the devil came there as
[1:07:34] well and deceive Eve he deceive Eve and
[1:07:40] God said I will never keep you in this
[1:07:43] Garden anymore I have to take you out
[1:07:47] then he take them out of the garden
[1:07:50] of when they were out there when they
[1:07:53] look back realized that they cannot go
[1:07:57] back because there was a flaming Sal and
[1:08:01] that flaming Sal was preventing them to
[1:08:06] go back to the tree of life because they
[1:08:11] partt on the tree of
[1:08:16] knowledge amen amen now from that
[1:08:22] time A man was running
[1:08:26] because he he left the presence of
[1:08:31] God and from that time God said I need
[1:08:36] to
[1:08:38] restore this man back to the tree
[1:08:41] of where a man has a control over
[1:08:47] everything that is the beginning is the
[1:08:52] Resolute then you need we need to go up
[1:08:55] a little
[1:08:56] bit on the ascending
[1:08:59] action because we need to get somewhere
[1:09:03] When I Was preparing the message I was
[1:09:06] thinking when the
[1:09:08] disc thinking when the
[1:09:10] disc was preaching the previous week
[1:09:14] about the Zenit
[1:09:16] point when you leave from the ground you
[1:09:20] need to go to the
[1:09:22] Apex the Apex there is the Zen point is
[1:09:28] where the whole
[1:09:30] interest is
[1:09:33] in amen amen when when you write a book
[1:09:38] that is why they are editors they are
[1:09:44] moderators you know they even scrutinize
[1:09:47] your
[1:09:48] script are you on the right path or not
[1:09:53] and advise you
[1:09:55] to Omit some because they were not
[1:09:59] relevant because your
[1:10:02] story when you start it it need to go up
[1:10:07] it need to go up and when you are up
[1:10:10] there you start to understand what was
[1:10:14] the story all
[1:10:15] about and when you are up there you
[1:10:19] cannot forever going
[1:10:21] up you need to come down and when you
[1:10:24] come down
[1:10:26] the people start to understand what you
[1:10:28] are trying to say and when you come to
[1:10:31] the
[1:10:32] conclusion of your story you now
[1:10:36] understand that is why some of the
[1:10:39] stories for you to understand you must
[1:10:42] read them twice
[1:10:45] orce then you understand but you read it
[1:10:48] once you may not understand you are
[1:10:51] still surprised or maybe you're looking
[1:10:53] at the movie this person is he going to
[1:10:57] be killed is he going to be
[1:11:00] survived all those things they taking
[1:11:03] you somewhere you even cross your feet
[1:11:07] and wanting to know what will happen
[1:11:11] what is the next
[1:11:13] move that is why the devil is so
[1:11:18] cunning if he can hold you on the
[1:11:23] so so so you you will even not com to
[1:11:28] church oh so oh
[1:11:34] [Music]
[1:11:40] so Days of Our Lives Days of Our Lives
[1:11:45] when it comes to an end for that
[1:11:48] day you want to know what will happen
[1:11:51] tomorrow and they give you a question
[1:11:54] mark for you to go on when you look you
[1:11:59] have been after that story for 5
[1:12:01] years it will always keep you on a
[1:12:05] s even when the preacher
[1:12:10] preaches something you want to see
[1:12:14] that's how the novelist write
[1:12:17] their that's how the soers
[1:12:21] things you so I'm I'm presenting this
[1:12:25] word of God for you to be pulled in
[1:12:30] order tomorrow you want to hear more the
[1:12:34] other day you want to hear more the next
[1:12:37] day you are in heaven that's what
[1:12:40] happens to Enoch amen you know it
[1:12:43] happens to
[1:12:44] Enoch he he he lived the word of God a
[1:12:49] day out on the last day he was in heaven
[1:12:55] in
[1:12:56] death if the word of God does not pull
[1:12:59] you there's a problem with that way
[1:13:03] there's a problem in you but if the word
[1:13:06] of God is real it will pull you day in
[1:13:11] day out until you see your own
[1:13:18] purpose amen amen so here things started
[1:13:23] now God started his way
[1:13:26] of redemption of healer
[1:13:30] of Amen because what happened in the
[1:13:33] garden ofen we blame no one but accept
[1:13:38] the will of God remember God Is A Healer
[1:13:43] it's a redeemer it's a Savor for him to
[1:13:48] do this someone must fall upon his
[1:13:52] falling he must redeem him
[1:13:55] someone must be sick on your sick bed he
[1:13:59] must heal you because he's a Healer so
[1:14:03] there's nothing wrong or nothing you can
[1:14:06] blame in the Garden of Eden it was the
[1:14:09] will of
[1:14:12] God from that time A man was running
[1:14:17] from the presence of
[1:14:18] God and God going after you Adam where
[1:14:24] are you
[1:14:26] amen am Moses come here God was always
[1:14:30] after a human being you can not save
[1:14:34] yourself you are just a sheep you need
[1:14:38] the great
[1:14:39] Shepherd to go after
[1:14:42] you and bring you back to your original
[1:14:47] position because our
[1:14:49] position was in the Garden of
[1:14:53] Eden we need to go there
[1:14:56] we need to have access there but this
[1:14:59] morning I will show you
[1:15:01] how we we must get the access there but
[1:15:05] for us to get there let's take this
[1:15:08] journey let's go up a little bit we see
[1:15:11] the Flaming
[1:15:13] sword stopping them from going back I
[1:15:17] just chose one character in the Old
[1:15:22] Testament but there are too many because
[1:15:25] I need you to go with me right to the
[1:15:29] you know
[1:15:30] Apex right to the you
[1:15:34] know because that's where things are
[1:15:37] happen I chose
[1:15:39] David because I love him so
[1:15:43] much amen amen you know King
[1:15:48] David when before he became a king he
[1:15:52] just has a string and a stone
[1:15:56] but God put him in the Kingdom in Israel
[1:16:01] in the Royal house and he gave him a
[1:16:07] sword
[1:16:08] David was was killing left and
[1:16:13] right using that sword and no one in his
[1:16:18] entire life defe him
[1:16:25] no one until he was on his death
[1:16:31] bed when he look back he could simply
[1:16:36] say I have killed many I have stood for
[1:16:40] the word of God I really used the king's
[1:16:44] sword because the sword of David was the
[1:16:48] sword of the
[1:16:49] king until he laid down and give it to
[1:16:54] Solomon
[1:16:55] when he gave it to Solomon he said to
[1:16:58] Solomon this sword need to be
[1:17:04] used amen amen but in time of Solomon
[1:17:09] was another
[1:17:11] dispens not the
[1:17:14] dispensation of
[1:17:16] killing was was not the the time of
[1:17:20] killing but it was the
[1:17:23] time of enjoying
[1:17:25] whatav
[1:17:28] did amen it was the time of
[1:17:32] Millennium did you hear the story of
[1:17:35] Solomon when he was a king in Israel he
[1:17:39] never went out
[1:17:42] for he asked God to give him
[1:17:46] wisdom when he was reigning he was reing
[1:17:51] with
[1:17:52] wisdom it was peace in Israel
[1:17:56] the read know that the readers they know
[1:18:00] that there was
[1:18:02] never time of Peace in Israel except the
[1:18:06] time of
[1:18:09] Solomon amen David was killing was
[1:18:13] fighting left and right for Solomon to
[1:18:19] benefit benefit amen amen when he became
[1:18:24] a king
[1:18:25] God made it precise to
[1:18:28] him you are not your
[1:18:31] father or like unto your father he was a
[1:18:36] man who stood for his purpose but
[1:18:41] you I have another purpose for
[1:18:44] you to
[1:18:46] ra without killing until the entire
[1:18:50] world wanted to know what is happening
[1:18:54] there in
[1:18:56] during the time of Solomon all over the
[1:18:58] world they were going to
[1:19:01] Israel to know the
[1:19:04] wisdom that Solomon
[1:19:06] had amen then we we go a bit higher so
[1:19:12] you see Solomon was different to
[1:19:15] David amen but they were two greatest
[1:19:21] King amen amen as I normally say
[1:19:25] we can all be the children of
[1:19:27] God but we are not the same God has
[1:19:30] given us different kind of
[1:19:33] characters we cannot we can all be
[1:19:36] deacons but the approach of the
[1:19:40] matter not the same does not make one a
[1:19:44] sinner or not message the same like you
[1:19:48] but different King
[1:19:51] gift among ourselves
[1:19:54] amen amen so you see
[1:19:57] David hand over to
[1:19:59] Solomon and we are still going up when
[1:20:03] we get up
[1:20:04] there right at the
[1:20:07] top right there on the
[1:20:09] climate we see our Lord Jesus
[1:20:13] Christ amen amen you know our Lord Jesus
[1:20:17] Christ is one man who was not like
[1:20:22] others have you ever asked yourself
[1:20:26] Jesus Christ was a young
[1:20:28] man but look at the character of
[1:20:32] Abraham how he did things you find that
[1:20:36] thing in
[1:20:38] Jesus look at David the way he lived for
[1:20:42] many years but his character is Right In
[1:20:47] Jesus you look at Solomon all the wisdom
[1:20:52] all what he has
[1:20:55] Jesus so Jesus
[1:20:57] Christ is the main
[1:20:59] [Applause]
[1:21:01] character
[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:04] you you look at
[1:21:07] Enoch what he he lived
[1:21:10] for you find it in Jesus you look at
[1:21:14] Moses you look at Joshua all what they
[1:21:18] live there were all in one
[1:21:21] man Jesus
[1:21:25] what kind of a man
[1:21:27] you amen
[1:21:29] amen let me read here again the
[1:21:34] unveiling of
[1:21:35] God Amen paragraph
[1:21:39] 197 says a type way
[1:21:43] back when David was leaving the
[1:21:48] temple rejected
[1:21:51] King went down through the street
[1:21:55] and an
[1:21:57] old a little old crippled up fellow
[1:22:00] crawling
[1:22:03] along never did like
[1:22:06] he he called him old hypocrite or
[1:22:10] something spit right in his
[1:22:13] face and that c pulled the sword and
[1:22:18] say I let that dog's head stay on him
[1:22:24] speit on him on my
[1:22:30] king amen amen David said let him
[1:22:35] alone God told him that told David you
[1:22:40] know the nature of David was to kill you
[1:22:44] disagree with him your family will bury
[1:22:48] you that's David but God came and tell
[1:22:53] him this one
[1:22:55] don't kill let them to fool against
[1:23:01] you there's a reason that you cannot see
[1:23:04] now but you will know it
[1:23:07] later and David probably he didn't know
[1:23:11] what he
[1:23:12] said went up the
[1:23:15] mountain
[1:23:17] looking looking back and
[1:23:20] crying that was King David
[1:23:24] nature was different amen am but God
[1:23:28] said leave it like that let them make
[1:23:32] you
[1:23:33] food because there's a reason it was a
[1:23:37] time of Jesus Christ because 00
[1:23:43] years the son of David was
[1:23:47] climbing the same
[1:23:50] Mountain looking out weeping over
[1:23:54] Jerusalem
[1:23:55] rejected
[1:23:57] King and they speak in his
[1:24:01] face took his
[1:24:03] so cut somebody's ear Jesus took it
[1:24:10] back you know this bodyguard of
[1:24:13] David took his soul wanted to kill that
[1:24:17] person but David said to him don't do it
[1:24:22] that time of David we was we see it
[1:24:27] exactly at our Lord Jesus
[1:24:30] Christ 800 years later
[1:24:35] same you know a God the way he loved
[1:24:41] David honored him for something that
[1:24:45] will
[1:24:46] stand for a thousand
[1:24:50] years Adam was supposed to stay in Eden
[1:24:55] for a thousand
[1:24:58] years but he couldn't and then after
[1:25:02] they partt from the Tree of
[1:25:04] knowledge he took them out for a
[1:25:09] reason but in the time of
[1:25:12] Solomon the son of David God respected
[1:25:16] David and said to him you will not build
[1:25:20] a
[1:25:21] temple but your son will and Solomon
[1:25:26] became the type of Jesus Christ because
[1:25:30] during his time there was no war in
[1:25:33] Israel during the time of Jesus Christ
[1:25:36] when he will be ruling in the Millennium
[1:25:40] will be no
[1:25:43] war the Bible says even the devil will
[1:25:48] be bound with a chain of
[1:25:52] circumstance he will deceive no
[1:25:56] if he
[1:25:57] deceived the first
[1:26:00] if but the last one will never be
[1:26:04] [Applause]
[1:26:07] deceived amen amen now we are in the
[1:26:10] Apex up
[1:26:12] there when we are
[1:26:14] there looking at our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:17] as
[1:26:19] individual and look back from where we
[1:26:23] started from the exposition from the
[1:26:27] ascending action we see we start to
[1:26:30] realize that those lives that children
[1:26:34] of God live in those times it was the
[1:26:38] Shad of this real one
[1:26:42] man and Jesus Christ was God himself
[1:26:46] they were living for
[1:26:48] God until up there we start to realize
[1:26:53] oh the old
[1:26:55] when all were coming when they were
[1:26:57] going up and then we see what they live
[1:27:03] for that is why Jesus said to
[1:27:06] them
[1:27:08] Abraham so my days he was so
[1:27:14] happy oh Abraham lived for
[1:27:18] this David live for this man because all
[1:27:22] their characters
[1:27:25] when you combine them they just give you
[1:27:28] the life of Jesus Christ as an
[1:27:32] individual Jesus is the father of the
[1:27:36] nation Jesus he
[1:27:39] raptured Jesus didn't have the sword of
[1:27:42] the
[1:27:43] king but he is the king and the king and
[1:27:48] the sword is one Jesus is the Tree of
[1:27:52] Life
[1:27:55] [Applause]
[1:27:56] the tree they rejected in the Garden of
[1:28:01] Eden
[1:28:04] Jesus
[1:28:07] amen amen amen I read
[1:28:12] investment paragraph
[1:28:15] 250 the man of God says and that great
[1:28:19] tree that great tree of life when he
[1:28:23] come on Earth they chopped it
[1:28:27] down by a Roman
[1:28:32] spear on a Roman
[1:28:38] Tree
[1:28:41] cruel cast
[1:28:44] tree but in there he
[1:28:48] redeemed a Bright
[1:28:51] Tree the bright tree one just like
[1:28:59] him that Eve
[1:29:01] tree from the Garden of Eden the tree
[1:29:05] that had
[1:29:06] fallen if in the beginning and Adam
[1:29:10] walked out with
[1:29:12] him now come now now Adam comes
[1:29:17] with and the second
[1:29:20] Adam knowing what he has he had his eyes
[1:29:26] open to come to
[1:29:29] receive
[1:29:31] his amen amen the Bible talks about the
[1:29:36] first
[1:29:37] Adam and the second ad it talks about
[1:29:41] the first Eve and the second Eve the
[1:29:45] Adam that can
[1:29:47] fail the if that can fa but the second
[1:29:52] ad was the quick in spirit he cannot
[1:29:57] fall and the second Eve being the Bride
[1:30:00] of our Lord Jesus Christ that cannot
[1:30:07] fall amen amen so when you look at the
[1:30:11] entire life of Jesus
[1:30:13] Christ you will truly believe
[1:30:15] there Old
[1:30:17] Testament was the Shad of the New
[1:30:21] Testament and if our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:25] up there I don't know if maybe they can
[1:30:28] flesh what I've asked the team to you
[1:30:30] know so that we go together amen
[1:30:35] amen we start to
[1:30:37] realize that the Old
[1:30:39] Testament in action going
[1:30:42] up when he going up right on top is our
[1:30:47] lord Jesus CHR then they started to
[1:30:50] understand even us looking from far
[1:30:54] we start to realize something but it
[1:30:57] mustn't add there so what's next amen
[1:31:02] amen from up there we need to go down
[1:31:06] when we get down we need to have
[1:31:10] access of
[1:31:14] life when when we when you read here
[1:31:18] let's read uh the Bible here in the Book
[1:31:21] of Ezekiel
[1:31:24] yeah amen
[1:31:28] amen chapter 28 ver 28 verse
[1:31:33] 18 verse uh 13 13 oh
[1:31:41] 13 Ezekiel 28
[1:31:47] verse3 thou H has been in Eden the
[1:31:50] Garden of God every precious stone was
[1:31:53] thy covering
[1:31:54] the sadas topas and the diamond the
[1:31:58] barel the onx and the Jasper the safer
[1:32:02] the emerald and the cab cabac and gold
[1:32:07] the workmanship of thy tbrad and thy
[1:32:11] pipes was prepared in thee in the day
[1:32:14] that thou was created verse
[1:32:17] 14 Thou Art the anointed cherub that
[1:32:21] cover and I have said the soul
[1:32:24] thou was upon the holy mountain of God
[1:32:28] thou has walked up and down in the midst
[1:32:31] of the stones of fire amen
[1:32:34] amen you know there in the Garden of
[1:32:38] Eden Satan was there as
[1:32:41] well you hear what the Bible says th has
[1:32:44] been in the
[1:32:46] Eden the Garden of God amen amen he was
[1:32:50] there and when God is doing something
[1:32:55] he was
[1:32:56] looking but not looking with a good eye
[1:33:02] to comply he was looking in a way that
[1:33:07] can do like him the way he doing some
[1:33:11] something I can you know overshine
[1:33:16] him that was Adam I mean Satan and God
[1:33:21] was
[1:33:21] looking in his heart
[1:33:24] when he look in his heart he see all
[1:33:27] those
[1:33:31] evil as I was saying you you cannot be
[1:33:35] killed or sabotaged by an unknown
[1:33:39] person the person close to
[1:33:42] you can do whatever he want
[1:33:45] life it's always the cases you look even
[1:33:48] on the
[1:33:49] natural those that were
[1:33:52] assassinated were the people that were
[1:33:55] close to
[1:33:57] you and then they deal with you they
[1:34:00] know what you like they know where you
[1:34:02] are what time they know what you eat
[1:34:05] they know what you drink they know what
[1:34:08] you what time you go to church and they
[1:34:10] are looking at you and they want to make
[1:34:13] sure 100% the day they assassinate you
[1:34:17] just a
[1:34:20] minute so these things never started
[1:34:23] here they started back there when this
[1:34:26] Cher stud God and then he wanted to
[1:34:31] overshine even today is still happening
[1:34:34] because history repeat
[1:34:37] itself it's just a spirit going from age
[1:34:40] to ages from age to
[1:34:43] ages that is why with David his own
[1:34:48] son did the same thing
[1:34:54] it's it's
[1:34:56] natural and it's something that you
[1:34:58] cannot stop even if you can pray you
[1:35:02] won't stop that thing even if you fast
[1:35:05] you won't stop that thing there it's
[1:35:09] natural it should happen to show the
[1:35:12] power of
[1:35:13] God God has just allowed these things so
[1:35:16] that you can
[1:35:18] know that he is
[1:35:20] God amen amen so this man J was right on
[1:35:25] top them showing the whole world that he
[1:35:29] is God he is the creator of Heaven and
[1:35:32] Earth but he doesn't stop there he must
[1:35:36] go further the only way to go further to
[1:35:43] come amen amen now we go to the
[1:35:45] descending
[1:35:47] Ed when we go to the
[1:35:49] descending we we we
[1:35:51] meet a man
[1:35:54] by the name of Paul we we meet a man
[1:35:59] like amen Amen on my draft here I just
[1:36:04] said Paul and Timothy being the pastor
[1:36:08] of the
[1:36:09] church that time then these two men they
[1:36:13] were all together and when Paul was
[1:36:16] there he was always said to
[1:36:19] Timothy my spiritual
[1:36:22] son follow me do like me as I do like
[1:36:27] Christ if you have question just follow
[1:36:30] me one of the days you will get the
[1:36:33] answer of the questions you had when you
[1:36:37] did not understand
[1:36:40] me I wish the church this
[1:36:43] morning I wish the church this morning
[1:36:46] hear me out there are certain things you
[1:36:50] do not understand just follow one of the
[1:36:53] days you will
[1:36:58] understand life is about
[1:37:04] stages amen amen we've got teachers here
[1:37:07] the primary teachers a child can
[1:37:11] come to you and say the reason why I did
[1:37:14] not come to school
[1:37:17] yesterday our stomach
[1:37:19] ache or head ache he won't say
[1:37:23] depression
[1:37:24] you say anxiety no headache or stomach
[1:37:28] that's all then that's a primary child
[1:37:31] primary sickness
[1:37:33] amen if a primary child can say teacher
[1:37:37] I did not come to school because I had
[1:37:46] anxiety it's not the nature of their
[1:37:49] sickness then as a teacher you just say
[1:37:53] my child you you'll get well don't worry
[1:37:58] after
[1:38:00] school
[1:38:01] he say no
[1:38:04] no no you didn't the teacher
[1:38:08] knows that's how far you can
[1:38:13] go he knows very well that you are lying
[1:38:24] there saying I'm
[1:38:27] I'm to the
[1:38:30] teacher then the teacher will
[1:38:32] smile and knowing that one of the days
[1:38:36] when you are a
[1:38:37] teacher you will
[1:38:39] understand there are certain things you
[1:38:42] cannot carry but when you are grown up
[1:38:46] you can be able to carry but if you
[1:38:49] cannot carry don't ague with the word
[1:38:54] that are ahead of you that knows better
[1:38:58] just say Lord help me to continue the
[1:39:02] journey one of the days I will see
[1:39:05] better I will understand better then I
[1:39:09] will know you
[1:39:10] better then you are
[1:39:17] done don't try to trick people if you
[1:39:21] can lie to the pastor
[1:39:26] yeah it's always the
[1:39:30] case amen so when I chose Paul and Peter
[1:39:38] it's for a reason because I've realized
[1:39:41] something if you can read in Hebrews
[1:39:43] chap
[1:39:44] 4:12 you understand what I'm talking
[1:39:48] about
[1:39:55] Hebrews 4:12 amen for the word of God is
[1:40:00] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:40:03] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:40:06] dividing aand of Soul and Spirit and of
[1:40:10] the joints and Marrow and is a deser of
[1:40:13] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:40:16] amen amen you see here it's Paul who
[1:40:21] says this the word of God is so
[1:40:25] quick and
[1:40:27] Powerful you know and and sharper than
[1:40:31] any two-edged
[1:40:35] s is how far Paul can
[1:40:41] go that s he liken it unto the word of
[1:40:45] God because God has revealed it unto him
[1:40:52] and he said to the
[1:40:54] in the Hebrew the word of God is like
[1:40:57] this that's how far I can teach as we
[1:41:02] are
[1:41:03] descending to the
[1:41:06] resolution when you descend to the
[1:41:09] resolution you start to realize start to
[1:41:13] understand what happen on the
[1:41:17] descending what happened to the Apex
[1:41:21] What happened to the
[1:41:24] I mean to the going up what happened to
[1:41:27] the exposition for you to understand the
[1:41:30] book you must read it until to the end
[1:41:35] that's where you get answers for the
[1:41:39] questions you had on the previous entire
[1:41:45] book amen amen so the last Church age
[1:41:50] there the answers for all the
[1:41:54] request the seventh

[1:42:02] that are left
[1:42:05] behind the seventh men
[1:42:08] messenger has to explain who is the
[1:42:12] first to the
[1:42:17] SI they were just living their life a
[1:42:21] very good life before the God but the
[1:42:24] seventh one is the one that put
[1:42:27] everything in
[1:42:34] position that s was always
[1:42:39] going ages and
[1:42:41] ages ages and ages Paul just teach about
[1:42:45] it he haven't touched it it was just
[1:42:49] going on the people and believed at the
[1:42:54] time of the
[1:42:56] resolution we need to have
[1:42:58] answers you have
[1:43:01] answers in the
[1:43:03] Gap brother Bram says then
[1:43:09] in that

[1:44:48] was and I said I'm afraid of these
[1:44:51] things and just then a voice spoke and
[1:44:56] shook the
[1:44:57] Canon and said this is the sword of the

[1:45:51] in their hand of
[1:45:55] [Applause]

[1:46:00] realized this if this is the sword of
[1:46:03] the key is the very same
[1:46:07] sword is the very same soul that David
[1:46:11] had is the very same soul that blocked
[1:46:15] the way to the tree of

[1:49:30] what the bride will
[1:49:32] [Music]
[1:49:35] benefit amen amen when you look for the
[1:49:38] king
[1:49:39] sword now with the
[1:49:42] bride if you need the way to
[1:49:46] heaven the
[1:49:50] bride amen amen when I was with the
[1:49:55] pastor I was giving him the report from
[1:49:59] L then I said pastor I'm surprised
[1:50:03] something is happening this time we no
[1:50:07] longer evangelized like before and have
[1:50:10] t and everything I still see the
[1:50:12] children of
[1:50:14] God coming and got baptized without
[1:50:17] being testified for then I give him an
[1:50:21] example I said I was driving from work
[1:50:24] when I was driving from work I passed
[1:50:27] the area where one of the brothers
[1:50:30] stay they were waiting for me on the
[1:50:34] road then when I see them and they see
[1:50:37] me they stop my car then I pull over and
[1:50:41] greet them day it was nice then brother
[1:50:46] is
[1:50:46] brother he introduced me to this man and
[1:50:51] said
[1:51:01] for a
[1:51:05] moment so then I was happy then
[1:51:11] I there after I said no we'll come and
[1:51:16] continue because my brother is going to
[1:51:18] work I just knock off will come and EXP
[1:51:22] more about the word of
[1:51:27] God I don't want explanation I'm going
[1:51:30] home when I come back I want you to
[1:51:33] bapti me we never open the Bible then I
[1:51:37] said how did
[1:51:42] you he says
[1:51:47] saw that's how God is calling us today
[1:51:52] we don't the tent and
[1:51:54] evangelized brought from the Garden of
[1:51:57] Eden he was always after a human being
[1:52:01] he was always after us he found
[1:52:06] us there was never a time where we were
[1:52:10] looking for him but he was forever
[1:52:13] looking for us that is why today he said
[1:52:18] if you don't want to worship me I will
[1:52:20] raise the stone
[1:52:23] and they will worship me if you don't
[1:52:26] want to listen to me this
[1:52:29] donkey will top because a donkey saw the
[1:52:34] angel of God and stop that the man
[1:52:39] cannot
[1:52:42] see seeing an
[1:52:46] Angel and even
[1:52:53] to now what have I done a donkey to see
[1:52:57] what I
[1:52:59] seeing see looking at an angel with a
[1:53:03] flame in
[1:53:04] s you cross here I tear you into
[1:53:11] pieces
[1:53:12] amen that's how it happens
[1:53:15] today amen
[1:53:19] amen we him last year this
[1:53:24] the way he
[1:53:31] is the Bible talks always talks of and
[1:53:35] them when looking at you I see like you
[1:53:39] are one of those he a man of big
[1:53:41] structure he's a giant and then this man
[1:53:44] got baptized because of you know so next
[1:53:50] maybe this week or next week when he
[1:53:53] come back
[1:53:54] from you will see him will
[1:53:56] baptize because he said so that's how
[1:54:00] God do things in
[1:54:02] this we are no longer preaching we are
[1:54:05] living a life that th people to the word
[1:54:09] of
[1:54:11] God by so doing ah we have reached our
[1:54:16] destination we are in a
[1:54:18] situation of point point of no return I
[1:54:22] like it when our pastor was teaching us
[1:54:26] about the runway when you are in the
[1:54:28] flight is on the Run way it doesn't have
[1:54:32] reverse we are not going back what never
[1:54:36] but what we
[1:54:37] go this time if you don't want to leave
[1:54:41] the word of God God is doing it in other
[1:54:45] children of God this time we are living
[1:54:48] in you read the last chapter of the
[1:54:51] Bible says if you don't want to believe
[1:54:55] it's okay if you don't want to be holy
[1:54:58] it's okay the time of us showing colors
[1:55:04] but what I can tell you the resolution
[1:55:09] that with the sword of the king it was
[1:55:12] the only sword that can take us back to
[1:55:14] the Garden of
[1:55:17] Eden when you look at the whole thing
[1:55:20] that kind of the pyramid it gives gives
[1:55:22] you a
[1:55:24] cycle the cycle of

[1:56:26] about the word of God when we were
[1:56:28] sharing about the word of God we were
[1:56:31] all because we talking only the
[1:56:36] positive because there are other people

[1:57:13] good say something positive something
[1:57:17] comfortable say something

[1:57:23] such keep quiet that's what my Prophet
[1:57:26] is teaching me you know if we can start
[1:57:30] gossiping if we can
[1:57:32] start gossiping talk bad about
[1:57:37] ourselves this church will be
[1:57:41] empty but if we can start talking nice
[1:57:46] about one another encouraging one
