So if you don't find space in here, Please don't blame anybody. Please. Uh it's a big event. We expecting quite a lot of people. But the pastor's wish. He himself said he didn't want to depart from some glittering place somewhere. He wanted to depart from his point of duty here. Hallelujah.

Um so that's how he how he wished that he should depart. &gt;&gt; He should he should be escorted by people who loved him most when he was alive. [applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the graveyard is at gas fontain uh during the suffering of the pastor. uh we limited the number of people to visit him because we want you to have the memory of him as he is. Amen. But this time around we want you every one of you give your respects as much as you can. There's no limitation on the people can come. We want just our elders to just make sure that everybody who want to come, let them come. But his wish is for those people who loved him when he was alive. [applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can see how the pastor valued you so much. Amen. Amen. Um because we wanted to have arrangements to have it in a bigger place like Heartfeld Arena but it wasn't in his wish. He want to depart from a point of duty. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's what we are going to do uh for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh he's in a better place than we are. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. It couldn't be worse. I don't think you can remember any day worse than today in this &gt;&gt; because the one we loved most we have lost him. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, there was a day which Peter was killed. Just imagine what happened the at the church. There was a day which Paul was killed. Imagine what happened at the church. What type of prayers were said at the church? Amen. So we are going through the same cycle which the church before has gone through and they have never been found wanting. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So let us mourn our pastor until we shall remember that we mourned him very well. Hallelujah. Amen. It's a prerogative of everybody to make sure that we honor our pastor in such a way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The pastor &gt;&gt; stood at this pulpit for more than 50 years. [applause] Every day he was preaching he was preparing for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you see your child is preparing for matrix when the exam come you don't worry about whether they going to pass or not. No, what you worry about is that how much are they going to pass? Amen. So for our pastor just waiting how much portion of heaven is going to get. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why we are mourning in hope. &gt;&gt; Knowing that now free from pain. Amen. Amen. We are so grateful to our Lord Jesus Christ for giving us a pastor like pastor. [applause] We are grateful to the family for sharing us pastor. Amen. [applause] So many times, so many hours, pastor was taken away from his family to take care of us. So we thank you family for sharing with us. We should clap hands for the family. [applause] Thank you children for sharing your father with us, grandchildren, for sharing your grandfather with us. Amen. Amen. We are grateful for the church for sharing pastor with us. [applause] It it is because of you that pastor was able to reach us in Malawi inc Zimbabwe Zimbabwe &gt;&gt; in Tanzania in Benin USA. &gt;&gt; He was able to do that because you people here loved him so much. God bless you so much. [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, Pastor Kim was such a good friend. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We shall miss him so much. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are thankful to God that he gave us an eternal brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, for those of you who are here, &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something. Uh, pastor and us. We are together. But only that we are in different rooms. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; We are just in different rooms. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't worry much. &gt;&gt; It's one that he's in a different room. &gt;&gt; Yes. He's with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's just in a different room. Mary in a different room. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we can stand and read the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. You help me. Uh let's go to the first Thessalonians 4 13 up to the end. But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. &gt;&gt; For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with his words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can be seated. We have already. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So uh the words of today is to comfort one another saying my brothers, &gt;&gt; my sisters, &gt;&gt; we should be mourning &gt;&gt; but with hope. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With hope. Because for us, we don't die. To die is to be separated. If you are separated from God, even if you are walking, you are dead. But what our pastor is in is asleep. Because Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's go to our friend Lazarus, for he sleepeth." And the disciples without discerning. If he's sleeping, he will wake up better. Then he said to them, "No, it's not that type of sleep. Uh he's dead." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because uh when we talk about uh sleep it is in those four stages and the fourth one is death is asleep. So our pastor is sleeping. He's resting. We could after working so hard. So those of us who are awake like today in case the day is today we are going to go because my brother my sister we should be prepared to go remember Jesus Christ comes to those who are waiting for him. Remember when Nathaniel &gt;&gt; was at home when Philip came to tell him he told him we have found that one which one? The one which they had been discussing the whole of their lives. That's what they have found. They were in one s of the country. They were telling that saying that when Andrew Andrew &gt;&gt; goes to find his brother Peter, he tells him we have found him. &gt;&gt; They were waiting for him. They were discussing about him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um we have had just elections in Malawi there. We have been promised a lot of things. &gt;&gt; If you think South Africa will be better, &gt;&gt; forget about it. There's a better place, a much better place for us where our pastor has gone. That's a place to aim for is so dirty. Dead dirt in both spiritual physical. Amen. There's a land fair says they are houses of of crystal clearar gold there. There's a land went there. There's a land better than this because the problem with you South Africans you try to compare us you and Malawians. Do you know in a class where you can take all the D children put them together they will be number one day. Number one. So South Africa is number one among the Dallas. &gt;&gt; You say we are better off than Malawi. &gt;&gt; You are also poor. There's a land which is better and it's not South Africa. &gt;&gt; It's not the United States. United States. &gt;&gt; I can take you to places in United States United States &gt;&gt; which m here will look like a town. There are more people sleeping in the streets in the United States than they are in South Africa. Yet you want to go to the United States United States. There's a land which is fair. Our pastor is there this morning. [applause] &gt;&gt; You know the wars of this day when when people fight wars today the general goes to hide &gt;&gt; generally. You know this is new because all the olden times the general was supposed to be in the front to tell you to tell you don't fear &gt;&gt; my brother my sister pastor didn't fear death [applause] the people are here who saw him. I saw him. Never in a day did he fear to die. Not even a day. He'll just wake up one morning. He'll be singing as if he's already in heaven. I'm telling the truth. One day he will just wake up. He will just sing as if he has already crossed. We were in ICU, &gt;&gt; machines attached to everywhere. Mama were there. We started singing &gt;&gt; and he was reading the he was reading the song. [applause] So when a general is in battle, He goes up front to tell you, "Fear not, &gt;&gt; fear not." &gt;&gt; We shouldn't fear &gt;&gt; because he has gone before us. [cheering] [applause] Hallelujah. Amen. So we should be encouraged that our pastor has gone through the process of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He should be our example. All of us should say I would like to be like crossing over whilst you are singing the songs of glory. Ask the people who were with him on Monday when he just woke up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we are in this message, brother sister one by one we'll be crossing the portals. We shall not fear &gt;&gt; because Paul when he came to the end. &gt;&gt; He said death where is your sting? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because these things which we have been promised are true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I always give an example. when my children were younger. So you tell them Peter Peter &gt;&gt; your birthday today this year will be at such a park immediately after that he goes to start saying that tells all his friends you I'm inviting you I'm not inviting you I'm inviting you where my father is going to give me a birthday party. I am a man. I can faith. But God cannot fail on his promise. He has promised eternal life to us. That means there is eternal life. And my brother, my sister, maybe even before you came into the message, maybe even before you believed, you were yearning for eternal life, what made you to y for eternal life? Because if I can tell you today, uh, let me ask those who are Malawians, don't don't raise your hands. Uh, who has ever tasted here? &gt;&gt; Don't worry. I don't want the Malawians to answer. They know what I'm talking about. You see, &gt;&gt; you people cannot have a desire of because you don't know it. You have never tasted it. &gt;&gt; You don't even know it. The only people who can have a desire of faith are those who have ever tested it before. &gt;&gt; So the only people who desire eternal life are those who have ever tested it before. [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Because something inside you will be calling for that eternal life. I I know you are consuming a lot of hibiscus here in South Africa, South Africa at my home. That's relish. Yeah, we we we eat pap with it. It's a common herb. You don't even know how it tastes when it's a it's a vegetable. We even add a ground nut paste to it. It's very nice and you're drinking it as tea. Amen. I even plant it behind my house because I have tested it before. I know this one. If you do this, if you do this, it is good. Eternal life is the same. If you repent of your sins, if you live light, it tastes good. It tastes better. &gt;&gt; My brother My sister, &gt;&gt; one day, &gt;&gt; one day, &gt;&gt; this bars of bones will hold me no more. &gt;&gt; You know the word is very very unfair. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People underestimate you just for being black. What's What's you want us to be continue being underestimated for being black? It's very unfair. &gt;&gt; This is not a place to be. There's a better place. This is a place &gt;&gt; so unfair. &gt;&gt; Do you know that there are people who are poor without any of their problem? &gt;&gt; They were just born poor. They die poor without wronging anybody. Some people are born in a family of rich people. They still even more because it's unfair. This world is unfair. This is not a place to be. The place to be is where our pastor is there. They are just greeting our brother, our beloved brother, our precious brother, our precious. Amen. There's no path there. There's no fascism there. There's no sectarianism there. It's all things of the earth. There's a land &gt;&gt; that's fair. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in the book of Job, &gt;&gt; Job 19 verse 26, &gt;&gt; 19:26, &gt;&gt; what does it say? Chapter 19 &gt;&gt; verse 26. &gt;&gt; Verse 26. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that is the day which I would want to be much a black person because that day I will be very happy as a black person. because I want to SEE GOD IN MY SKIN. I want to see God in my flesh. That's the day which you know my brother that I'm not I'm not a common person. No no no no no. Malawian what can you do? Yes. But when I am there son of a king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 27 &gt;&gt; verse 27. &gt;&gt; Whom I shall see my for myself. Nobody will see it for it will not be the cabinet seeing him and then they tell me no the president is all right. I shall see the king myself. Mine eyes, the same one, this one of mine &gt;&gt; shall behold. &gt;&gt; Mine eyes shall behold. &gt;&gt; So whenever you are called to the presence house, don't worry. That's nothing for me. That's nothing. Me I will see God. Me I will see God. You can see anybody which you want. You can you can you can tell yourself oh me I see I see Donald Trump that's fine. See Trump me I will see God himself. Hey my brother, &gt;&gt; the pastor is there now. [applause] &gt;&gt; If I was not sure that the pastor is not there today, I wouldn't have come from Malawi. Amen. I'm too sure about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; In here, &gt;&gt; there are so many of you in here which shall see God. Amen. I cannot prevent you. You cannot prevent me. The only person who can prevent me from seeing God is me. Where's your enemy, my brother? &gt;&gt; Point him. &gt;&gt; It's me. &gt;&gt; Where's your enemy, my brother? Where's your enemy? Number one is this one. &gt;&gt; You don't have an enemy worse than the one. Don't try to start pointing others as enemies. Enemy number one. [applause] The others are number two, number three, number four, number five, number six. But the worst enemy which you have which will prevent you from going to heaven is yourself. What is the pastor doing this morning? &gt;&gt; We can go to the book of Samuel 28. 1 Samuel 28 Samuel 28 verse 14- 19. You should see what people of God do when they die. 1 Samuel 28:14. And he said unto her, "What form is he of?" And she said, "An old man cometh up, and he is covered with a mantle." And Saul perceived that it was Samuel. And he stood with his face to the ground, and bowed himself. And Samuel said to Saul, "Why hast thou dis disqued me? &gt;&gt; Disquited me. &gt;&gt; Disquited me to bring me up." And Saul answered, "I am so distressed. For the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me," and answerth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams. Therefore I have called thee that thou mightest make known unto me what I shall do. Then said Samuel, wherefore then doest thou asked me of seeing the Lord is departed from thee and is become thine enemy. And the Lord hath done to him as big by me. For the Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David. &gt;&gt; Yes. Go ahead. 18. Because thou obeyest not the voice of the Lord, nor executest his fierce wrath upon Amalcch. Therefore have the Lord done this thing unto thee this day. &gt;&gt; Again, another one. Moreover, the Lord will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of Philistines, and tomorrow shall thou and thy sons be with me. The Lord also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hands of the Philistines. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, he died a prophet, &gt;&gt; he comes up, &gt;&gt; he starts prophesying again. &gt;&gt; He's a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh I don't know how why we condemn each other so much. You can see here somewhere he's talking to so &gt;&gt; according to all of us &gt;&gt; was a backseed king but Samuel said to Saul you shall be with me this night. That's why David said these are God's anointed ones. So even Saul has got a portion in the in the in in the kingdom of God. Stop condemning one another &gt;&gt; because how can you testify to a drunkard to come to be a believer &gt;&gt; and you condemn me when I'm preaching the word here? I'm standing on the pit. You condemn me. Are you going to tell I drunk at a there's a good God. Let's go to heaven. Because &gt;&gt; as for me, &gt;&gt; since I was young, &gt;&gt; I have known nothing apart from being here and you still condemn mem. Did you see some condemning the man says you be on this side with me? Hallelujah. Appreciate one another's fight. Your fight is not my fight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know fights are different. A poor man fights with hunger. A rich man fights with constipation. He's fighting. There's no better place to be. Because one of the biggest problem we have in South Africa, too much food. It's a big problem in Malawi. We fight less food. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; All those are problems. There's no better place. When you are hungry, you are sick. When you are too much food, you are sick. Samuel &gt;&gt; told so &gt;&gt; tomorrow &gt;&gt; you'll be with me. &gt;&gt; So if you can go to now we don't have to read because I I believe my I'm already above time. So you can see that even if you if you go to mount transfiguration Peter John and James when they saw Moses and Elijah Nobody had to tell them that is Moses that they themselves told us they saw Elijah and Moses. They themselves Moses had been dead for about 2,000 years. Elijah had been dead for so many years. But these disciples, they immediately recognized that must be Moses. That must be Elijah. When you come come to Revelation 11:6, Revelation 11:6, when the Moses and Elijah are there with power to shut heaven, you know, the spirit of shutting heaven is of Elijah. The spirit of turning water into blood, you know that is the spirit of sming the earth with plas and at will. then you know that is Moses. So we don't need an interpretation because the prophet under the seven seas has opened our eyes of understanding and our eyes have seen the glory of the Lord. We have seen although it's it's a little bit blood we have seen. &gt;&gt; We have seen that the eternal life is about to come. So remember we live here in on earth in three dimensions which is light, matter and time. Our senses can contact them. But my brother, my sister, within this very room, there is another dimension moving. There are pictures moving inside here. There are phones moving inside here. Somebody's answering a phone behind there. The voice is passing through here. We can't see it. We can't hear it. Because we are not in that dimension. But if we can just lay eyes up to that dimension, we can see things. Our pastor is in a dimension higher. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's a fourth dimension which is a communication channel. And there's a fifth dimension which we're going to talk about later on. But where we are at is the at the sixth dimension. the souls under the altar where our pastor is now. My brother, my sister, brother says, &gt;&gt; when they are there, they are able to look at us back. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me get the quotation. I'll tell you they are able to look at us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me get the the quotation says &gt;&gt; I have it. I have it my brother. &gt;&gt; Sister's pictures come through. No, I did underline it. [crying] Matter time to me. I I'll get it. Don't worry. How did it disappear? Let me let me just read this one. Go to present stage of my ministry. &gt;&gt; Present stage of minist 0 9 08. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [crying] &gt;&gt; I'll find it. Don't worry. I'll &gt;&gt; just uh Yeah. Paragraph 26. &gt;&gt; Uh, paragraph 26. Present stage of my ministry. &gt;&gt; That one. Now in this vision, &gt;&gt; I believe I was caught to that sixth dimension. Looking back down here, could see back. Hallelujah. See &gt;&gt; that's the site isn't exactly with eyes that's e3 but sight is greater than so the sight they have there their contact is far beyond contact of our natural senses. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. How many are so happy that the pastor is looking at us? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. One day a man &gt;&gt; was um a blind man, a blind black man in a He was telling brother Bernham says have mercy have mercy there was segregation in Arkansas by that time. So he was standing on the other side of the Lord. Black people were supposed to be on the other side. So brother wanted to go and see that man. The brother the brother said don't do that. Don't do that. It will cause a riot. Abraham says, "If I don't go that side, I need to be on the water." So he went to that side. He he looked at this uh man. He said, &gt;&gt; the man said, "My mother was a saintly woman. She worshiped God. Last night she came to say, "Son, go to that street. Stand on his place like this. When you will stand there, there will be a man of God who pass through there and you receive your sight." &gt;&gt; His mama had been died for a long time. Some of our mothers are busy chasing us with the knives at night. Here is a good mama comes back to take care of her child. A sentient woman Hey, please sisters go go to heaven center. We need your help down here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember sister hope when when brother Brham &gt;&gt; wanted to shoot himself, she came and put her hand around. Honey, &gt;&gt; I am better off. Promise me that you're not going to do this. I will not leave until you promise that you'll be all right. &gt;&gt; Brother, go and check. It was a little hand of hope in the grave holding brother. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They are there. They're seeing what we are doing. So, Hope was seeing what he was doing. Mama was seeing his boy suffering. That's why she came back to help her boy. So many places where you find things happening like that. You can even see here somewhere came up to speak to Saul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother &gt;&gt; with a pastor, &gt;&gt; we just in different rooms. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [crying] &gt;&gt; We which are alive shall caught up &gt;&gt; because they are in a higher dimension. us will be caught up to meet them in the air. and my brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; brother Bernham says &gt;&gt; on the same on the same scripture verse 24 my brother go to the uh the same u book go to paragraph 20 24 &gt;&gt; paragraph 24 page &gt;&gt; yeah 24 go 24 yeah now is in the seventh dimension. Now you see the Christian when he dies he goes under the altar. A Christian like you like you my brother. A Christian like you go under the altar of God right in the presence of God under the altar. At rest. At rest. &gt;&gt; Time is no more there. You know time is measured by the way the earth rotates. How the earth rotates around the sun. Um, how the sun rotates around the galaxy. I don't know why we live so proud here on Earth. Do you know that the sun &gt;&gt; hasn't moved even 1% of the journey around the galaxy the whole the whole 80 years of your life. If we were going to put a sequ as big as this as the se of the sun around the galaxy. All the life which you have lived here on earth is just a dot because the sun takes about 250 million years to move around. 250 million years and you are here. I am minister of security. I am minister of this. Minister of this. &gt;&gt; It's like a fly in my car from here to Johansburg. It lives only for seven days. When a fry lives for seven days, but you can take it in your car from here to John Bay. and you'll be very happy. Why are we proud of this life? &gt;&gt; It's nothing. It's vanity. The only people who should be happy today are Christians because they got a better place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because somebody told me a clever man, &gt;&gt; my brother, where you start from &gt;&gt; is not a problem, &gt;&gt; it's where you end. &gt;&gt; It's where you end. You should take care where you end because where you end. That's where you're going to stay a little bit longer. Jesus. My brother, my sister, if there are people who are clever, they cannot be clever than a Christian living a life for God. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So our pastor was very clever. He knew a day like this will come and he was very very prepared. &gt;&gt; No, ask the people who are around him. He never sang as if he's saying ah you know sometimes we sing songs which are very not good if they are my troubles are so many you are praising your troubles. Hey, I don't know me. People just hate me for I don't know how I was. My friends have good friends. They don't like me. My friend, even today can come and pick me from here and push me to Malawi. I &gt;&gt; I'm not outside the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing I mind to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't mind about being in this circle, that circle, this circle, the Kiwanis, the golf club, the club, club. Useless [cheering] &gt;&gt; rat racing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. the club of big pastors, the club of small pastors, the club of this, the club of that. I don't care about that. I want to belong to the kingdom of &gt;&gt; I don't mind to be invited to your penthouse. My God, &gt;&gt; he hides me in his pavilion. &gt;&gt; My God hides me where? &gt;&gt; In my pavilion. &gt;&gt; In his &gt;&gt; in his pavilion. Go and read this in the book of Psalms. &gt;&gt; I I'm invited to God's pavilion. So which place is better than God's perfect &gt;&gt; my brother? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to keep just imagine even even a place. What? What's that? &gt;&gt; My headquarters. Where's your headquarters? &gt;&gt; Headquarters. You go there alive, &gt;&gt; you end up dead. I am going where there is life. I'm not going to go where there is my life is going to be lost. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Our pastor is in a better place today. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, uh these things &gt;&gt; we should talk about my brother. One day, one day, hey, I don't know. &gt;&gt; Um one day you see you are just there. Because God shall reward even a glass of water which you give to his people. What about you people who have lived the whole of your life. You have raised your families in this message. Even now even your grandchildren are growing up in this message. Oh what a good work for you. God bless you. God bless you. You know, most of the times we always want to focus on the negatives. We don't want to focus on the positives. My brother, my sister, you are a guarant soldier and uh you know there will be angels to pick you up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where's my Okay, let me see. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now &gt;&gt; I my prayer might ask to this church as I'm closing is my brother. My brother, the person who sitting next to you is a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Let's pray for one another. &gt;&gt; As we are mourning, &gt;&gt; let's mourn in prayer. How will the people know that we are his disciples? When we love one another. Can I hear? Can I hear? I don't want to say &gt;&gt; when we love one another. &gt;&gt; Then the people will say &gt;&gt; these are &gt;&gt; his disciples. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um I encourage my young men uh to buy good clothes and good cars. Those of you who are graduates and you are walking, pray until you get a car. That's not humility. That's a disgrace. pray God to give you because there's no way can be given to Pentecostals and not to give you but I don't like people to form clubs in the church. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Open the doors. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One of you when you have bonus one day, just take all of us to go and eat at the hotel. Why do you want to eat all the money yourself? Aren't you tired eating of eating all the money? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; We don't love one another. We people. &gt;&gt; The only time we eat is when one day invite us. Let's love one another. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; One day I'll be in a box gone without even eating your money. You don't love me. One day you would wish you have done me better, but I will not be able to respond. That's why the pastor said, "Let me be among the people who loved me when I was." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's love one another when we are alive. [applause] Some of you, &gt;&gt; the only day which you cry for me is when I'm dead. What will it do for me? You are supposed to cry for me now that I should be a better person than what I am right now. Cry for me now because the day will come even if you cry for me. It will not help me. This is a better day to cry for one another. Brother says, "Don't entertain a bad thought against one another." Because you know this bad thoughts about one another, let alone plotting against one another will give you cancer. Brother says that &gt;&gt; what we need to do my brother my sister &gt;&gt; if we want to be seen as his disciples it's not who has got a quotation which is bigger than mine. If your quotation can't keep us together is not a good one [applause] [cheering] is a quotation of contion because all the things which you should be talking about here with one another it's love. What type of love? The type of love which they do at the tavern in the tavern. There will be a group there, another group there. Those guys have got knives and guns. This branch here got even knives and guns. is that so they say you you know um I'll say something &gt;&gt; don't get worried I I'll say something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um Russia &gt;&gt; and America &gt;&gt; they discuss peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; America comes &gt;&gt; put that that behind you.

[applause] you know uh if you can go uh among the you know the country in transit guys they tell each other I like this guy because he's honest when we hit You see that type of love outside the word is not love. Love &gt;&gt; has to be inside the word. When you love one another, love each other inside. When you pray for someone &gt;&gt; and you don't have a feeling for them, that prayer is nothing. The only prayer &gt;&gt; which will prevail when you enter into their shoes. You be like them. That is how miracles happen because you are a high priest who is touched by our extremities. You have to be touched. You have to share the problem. Jesus shares our problems. Our pastor was sharing our problem. &gt;&gt; Hey church, the pastor is gone. &gt;&gt; The pastor is gone. &gt;&gt; He took care of us very &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; We thank God for a man who came gave his life for us, lived as our pastor, never took advantage of us.

People have taken the whole of their patients and given them to their pastors. Our pastor didn't do that. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey my brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; our pastor, &gt;&gt; live the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can stand up and clap our hands for the Lord.

It's our promise to our pastor that even if he has gone, me and these people will continue living a life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until we catch up with him in the &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Help us, father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has gone without fearing death. &gt;&gt; I was there with him. He never feared death even an inch. He went home singing the songs of Zion. &gt;&gt; We also as we are struggling on in this life, give us a the same psalms which you gave to our pastor. &gt;&gt; Because one day Herod was asking why are these people not afraid of death? &gt;&gt; Because they the people told them because they got Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord Jesus, we want the same God. We want the same [music] Holy Spirit to be among us. We have said things today which couldn't be said when the whole people are visiting us are here.

Brother Brham told us that if you love me, you love my children. &gt;&gt; Help us, father. But the same revelation should be upon us. Help us, father. We need you more than ever before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The I wouldn't want to be ashamed to meet my pastor one day. And with all knowing the pastor should know that I am the one who's denying food to his wife and his children.

Help us, Father, as we are continuing on morning our pastor. Let us love one another. &gt;&gt; Give us peace. The same peace which you talked about when you are on the Sea of Galilee.

We don't have baptisms today. So I just want to take this opportunity to welcome the believers from pastor Zakula if they can stand. They just arrived late but they are here. They came with an elder my brother. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Can we just say shalom to the church? [applause] &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; That title looks so so heavy for me. &gt;&gt; Uh I'm brother Daniel [music] &gt;&gt; from Amen Tabernacle Tabernacle. Uh we just thought of uh coming here today &gt;&gt; because I believe we you know the relationship that your church had this church has had with a tabernacle. When we speak about a tabernacle history &gt;&gt; here in South Africa, &gt;&gt; we cannot speak about it without mentioning pastor and [applause] the pastor Zak is not around. &gt;&gt; He's in Congo and he called me throughout the day. He was in disbelief. Uh papa said, "I don't know how you going to deal with this countless time. He's been wanting to come to see the elder." And uh the last time that he was supposed to come again, I think uh we were we we have been told that the pastor wasn't well and uh unfortunately he's not really it's not sitting well with him that he did not see him. He's been calling asking me how true this information is. &gt;&gt; And I said yes, it was true. when I got the confirmation. &gt;&gt; But nonetheless, he called me again and he is in deep shock. Very deep shock that he had to travel somewhere again. He even cancelceled it and he's trying to see if he can arrange things in order for him to be back here. But [music] uh we have lost an icon in the message. At times we don't realize how great somebody is up until I have been receiving countless number of calls about him. But nonetheless, we are with you at heart. We just came here so that we can comfort you as well and tell you we are together. His departure is not the end. He actually took the baton and has passed it on to us and let's make sure his [snorts] legacy lives on. I came with three brothers from the church, &gt;&gt; two brothers and a sister. I came with brother Trident. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Trident is he a minister &gt;&gt; right at the back there is a minister at the church. Then uh we have got brother Silas the youth leader in the church and there is also a sister assistant in the church. thought is best we just come and sabotage along with you. May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastor, we are honored that you are here. Can you also say shalom to the church? Shalom. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Shalom church. Shalom. The passing away of our pastor. &gt;&gt; Myself as well. After hearing about the passing of our pastor, &gt;&gt; I was deeply concerned because because I'm one of those who was brought up by the past. &gt;&gt; 1976. &gt;&gt; I since knew him in the years of 1976. I still remember another year. I think it's 1987. 1987. I visited him at his home. While he was still staying in Maban, I was with my firstborn daughter. Her name is Sister Priscilla. When I arrived at the home of the pastor, that's when Aquila was born. So the pastor gave the brother the name Akida because Priscilla has come. &gt;&gt; Do we still remember? &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's an old man that I'm saying he brought us up. &gt;&gt; I still remember back in the years When we had the conventions in Tefl, &gt;&gt; he was teaching us the word. He will take the entire convention preaching to us. So yesterday I had an emergency to rush to Captain Park. So when I finish everything there, I tell my I'm with my wife here. I tell my wife that I should go to mommy tomorrow. So that's why I'm here just to comfort the church [music] as the pastor has preached. Don't cry not having hope because this life it doesn't end here. There's still another life ahead of us that is better than this one. [music] That is why I'm saying family and the church be ye comforted. That is how God has planned it and in God there is no mistake. It is his plan and that is how he has planned things and the pastor &gt;&gt; I used to tell people that every person who came here on earth &gt;&gt; has a purpose. is unfortunately don't know your own purpose. But then we thank God that he knew his purpose and we believe that if God [music] decided to take him &gt;&gt; that means his purpose was accomplished. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. God bless you. Brother, &gt;&gt; if you can come forth [music] to read the message, then we will sing a song after and we are dismissed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Shalom saints. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the condolences to the family and the church at large. &gt;&gt; Amen. Dearly beloved of the Lord, it was with great sadness that I awoke the other morning to hear that my elder brother had been taken to glory. Although I am happy that he no longer has to suffer in this world, I am saddened by the fact that the baiton which he carried in this final push to the finish line has been dropped. I had made reservations to come to the convention to hear more of the subject of the whit stone interpretation since that was the very theme of these meetings. As you may recall, he said that he would speak of the white stone again. It is my prayer that God will rise up someone who will pick up the baiton again with the same inspiration. Carry this subject further. Elijah was not Elijah was not simply carried by the chariots to glory but threw down his mantle to be used for double glory. May there be someone who will be used for his for this final sprint. Your brother and elder Raid Gabrielson from Florida. I have shockingly learned of the passing of our beloved pastor. May his soul rest in peace beyond the kitten of time. He has fought a good fight of faith and finished the course. What a life to emulate. Godly used him to expound and make clear to the world what the seventh seal is. We are beneficiaries of that revelation. May the Lord help us to leave to leave it as we wait for the rapture. Condolences to the entire Maloi church in these hard times. All glory should go to the Lord Jesus Christ who does all things sovereignly in his own appointed time.
