[30:53] requested brother to
[30:56] interpret

[31:23] apology normally when we have a
[31:25] gathering like this we have a keyboard
[31:28] player to play the church music for
[31:32] us but as you can see we don't have it
[31:35] today the brother that was supposed to
[31:38] play for us was caught up at work so he

[1:04:18] places we haven't yet experienced them
[1:04:23] here
[1:04:24] if it happened but in a small
[1:04:29] scale look what is
[1:04:31] happening around the
[1:04:35] world and it was not
[1:04:37] so but the Lord said as it was in the
[1:04:43] days of s so

[1:04:50] times and yes it is like so it
[1:04:55] means now it is going home time amen

[1:05:11] anything that had a
[1:05:14] [Music]
[1:05:15] beginning is a
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:21] creation do you know that
[1:05:24] your body and
[1:05:28] mind have been
[1:05:33] created but the spirit inside your
[1:05:41] body it has not been created the spirit
[1:05:45] was processed from
[1:05:51] God how what did God do to he was a
[1:05:56] St just standing
[1:06:00] there what did do he breath the Breath
[1:06:04] of
[1:06:05] Life
[1:06:07] his and
[1:06:10] Adam
[1:06:17] living had not done
[1:06:22] so even day Adam will remain a
[1:06:27] statue being Washed by the people amen
[1:06:32] amen but God will not make a St he made
[1:06:35] a man in his
[1:06:38] own
[1:06:41] image
[1:06:49] and now when we have tripped and the
[1:06:52] devil has has has made us to do
[1:06:55] wrong what did God
[1:06:59] do he came and put on the flesh that is
[1:07:04] like ours to come for our
[1:07:11] Redemption is to bring
[1:07:15] back to the original that's why
[1:07:20] Mama redeemed
[1:07:22] now
[1:07:24] because when he was
[1:07:27] created she was
[1:07:29] created a young
[1:07:31] [Applause]
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:40] woman in heaven amen amen that's why
[1:07:45] that's why even Jesus
[1:07:47] [Applause]
[1:07:49] Christ 33 years he could not go beyond
[1:07:52] 33 years
[1:07:54] amen
[1:07:59] because amen we have an old God
[1:08:04] yes amen amen now he lived really up
[1:08:13] to3 33 years amen that's why we shall be
[1:08:19] [Applause]
[1:08:22] young amen that's why don't worship an
[1:08:24] old
[1:08:26] [Applause]
[1:08:28] God sure
[1:08:31] that that the age ends up to
[1:08:38] 33 Beyond 33 we are already taking pills
[1:08:43] amen amen now we want to go
[1:08:46] back where there's no
[1:08:51] hospital
[1:08:52] amen there's no police
[1:08:55] station
[1:08:56] St we want to go
[1:09:00] back a
[1:09:02] Christian is
[1:09:04] somebody who is going
[1:09:08] [Applause]
[1:09:08] [Music]
[1:09:11] back
[1:09:12] now your body was created but not your
[1:09:19] soul your spirit the Bible says
[1:09:31] God Spirit into the if he had not
[1:09:35] done Adam will remain a St but
[1:09:48] if breath and then Adam started speaking
[1:09:52] and he started talking
[1:09:55] all right amen now now this
[1:09:59] body is
[1:10:02] temporal that's
[1:10:05] why when you come out of this
[1:10:08] body you enter into another
[1:10:13] B now let's listen like
[1:10:16] [Music]
[1:10:18] this did you hear
[1:10:21] that anything that has a
[1:10:26] beginning has an
[1:10:32] end are you a
[1:10:39] Christian I can show you in the Bible if
[1:10:42] you are a
[1:10:46] Christian you have no
[1:10:49] beginning that's
[1:10:52] why Jesus Christ when he
[1:10:57] comes to
[1:10:59] redeem it is
[1:11:01] because he
[1:11:04] made without the beginning
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:08] amen the Bible
[1:11:11] says in the Garden of
[1:11:17] Eden what God
[1:11:20] created it was just the body amen
[1:11:24] amen
[1:11:26] amen after creating
[1:11:29] Adam
[1:11:31] now now he brought in
[1:11:34] life into
[1:11:37] Adam all right amen now let me read this
[1:11:41] now
[1:11:44] okay now
[1:11:48] anything that had a
[1:11:52] beginning is a
[1:11:55] creation that's why the body was
[1:11:59] created but Bible the spirit was created
[1:12:03] but the Bible doesn't say the spirit was
[1:12:05] created he breath into
[1:12:08] the the Breath of
[1:12:11] Life That's from
[1:12:14] himself he made you part of
[1:12:18] himself when he he breath into
[1:12:22] you
[1:12:24] his own
[1:12:26] Spirit not
[1:12:31] wind all right amen
[1:12:35] and now when we
[1:12:40] F because of the Enemy being the
[1:12:47] devil that's when now the one who
[1:12:49] created our
[1:12:52] bodies
[1:12:54] took a form a body like ours and came
[1:12:57] here on
[1:12:59] Earth amen
[1:13:02] amen he says
[1:13:06] the knew him
[1:13:12] not now which the Bible says which ones
[1:13:15] knew
[1:13:18] him the world knew him
[1:13:22] not but
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:31] fa we are we are thankful mothers the
[1:13:36] world he came to the
[1:13:38] world the
[1:13:40] world him
[1:13:44] not it doesn't end up
[1:13:51] there still he came to the
[1:13:54] world and the world knew him
[1:13:58] not because the world is something that
[1:14:05] started amen
[1:14:08] amen that's why the world could not
[1:14:17] recognize he has no
[1:14:20] beginning now
[1:14:22] anything
[1:14:24] that has a
[1:14:26] beginning doesn't know
[1:14:30] him
[1:14:38] brother now read that scripture
[1:14:52] again that
[1:14:54] scripture where he
[1:14:56] says almost every day read it all the
[1:15:00] time when he
[1:15:03] prayed I am not of the
[1:15:08] world am amen
[1:15:16] amen Jesus Christ when he prayed I am
[1:15:20] not now the world

[1:15:40] the
[1:15:42] we the
[1:15:43] world

[1:16:40] evil they are not of the world even as I
[1:16:43] am not of the world
[1:16:46] Amen God bless you amen all right amen
[1:16:51] now just to
[1:16:53] [Music]
[1:16:56] this we
[1:16:59] continueing all the days
[1:17:01] until until
[1:17:05] then
[1:17:09] until go on
[1:17:14] [Music]
[1:17:17] see
[1:17:19] then with
[1:17:22] Jo
[1:17:26] [Music]
[1:17:29] all the
[1:17:33] day my eyes
[1:17:36] behold the
[1:17:43] city the
[1:17:46] day God
[1:17:50] calls me home
[1:17:53] amen
[1:17:55] amen every day when you go to
[1:18:04] sleep you don't know if tomorrow you
[1:18:07] will still be there all right
[1:18:11] am that's
[1:18:16] whys
[1:18:18] seek Him seek the Lord and find him amen
[1:18:26] amen God doesn't just say he says seek
[1:18:32] Him seek the
[1:18:34] Lord and find
[1:18:46] him something I was reading something
[1:18:49] here
[1:18:51] uh if
[1:18:54] where it
[1:18:57] says okay the world before I go back to
[1:19:01] the world the and the the world is
[1:19:09] system syst world called the world but
[1:19:14] the
[1:19:15] Earth is
[1:19:17] this amen
[1:19:21] amen I think we are
[1:19:24] understand I I quote something
[1:19:27] here if
[1:19:32] then it
[1:19:36] says uh because anything that had a
[1:19:42] beginning is a
[1:19:46] creation but God was not
[1:19:50] created he was always
[1:19:55] God the time because the real
[1:20:00] man was a
[1:20:05] the that's the real
[1:20:09] man that's why right
[1:20:11] now we don't see that
[1:20:14] body but she's much
[1:20:17] alive and
[1:20:20] happy that's why com one
[1:20:25] another why
[1:20:28] because the Mama today she's the
[1:20:31] happiest
[1:20:34] person even if we were to call her
[1:20:39] back she wouldn't agree with us because
[1:20:43] where she
[1:20:45] is she is
[1:20:48] heavy amen amen she's Beyond Time
[1:20:55] because a Christian
[1:20:58] started back there Beyond
[1:21:01] Time the Bible
[1:21:03] says H we were in
[1:21:06] him before the foundation of the
[1:21:21] world
[1:21:26] Epi Ephesians yes Ephesians just listen
[1:21:30] to
[1:21:31] that Ephesians chapter 4 verse
[1:21:37] 30 yes and grief not the holy spirit of
[1:21:41] God whereby ye are sealed unto the day
[1:21:44] of redemption
[1:21:46] amen
[1:21:48] yes
[1:21:49] continue let all bitterness and r bre
[1:21:53] and anger and drama and evil speaking be
[1:21:56] put away from you with all malice and be
[1:22:00] ye kind one to another tenderhearted
[1:22:04] forgiving one another even as God for
[1:22:07] Christ's sake have forgiven you God
[1:22:09] bless you
[1:22:15] amen can a Christian
[1:22:21] hate
[1:22:25] please answer me
[1:22:31] no because Bible the B says he who hates
[1:22:36] his
[1:22:37] brother is
[1:22:41] like who
[1:22:44] killed his
[1:22:47] brother all right
[1:22:49] amen now you as a Christian
[1:22:54] you don't want to be
[1:23:00] like killed his
[1:23:04] brother and the Bible
[1:23:06] says he who
[1:23:09] hates is
[1:23:17] like he doesn't
[1:23:20] even uh want the
[1:23:25] conditions wants me to put
[1:23:30] conditions to say the reason I hate this
[1:23:35] brother already before I explain
[1:23:39] anything God says you are
[1:23:45] like maybe I I'm going to say I hate
[1:23:49] this
[1:23:51] brother because
