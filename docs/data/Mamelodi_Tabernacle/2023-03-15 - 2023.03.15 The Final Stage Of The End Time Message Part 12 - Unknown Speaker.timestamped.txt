[0:47] [Music]
[0:57] amen
[1:16] um
[1:19] we thank God for this privilege
[1:37] established a covenant with
[1:55] a company
[1:58] before
[2:36] [Applause]
[2:42] this morning
[2:46] and then
[2:48] conditions outside are the contrary
[2:52] to the
[2:54] human mind
[2:55] is
[3:01] but to us
[3:03] worship God under such circumstances
[3:08] produces equality
[3:12] um
[3:20] if you want to see a quality of things
[3:22] you should
[3:23] put them under pressure
[3:26] um
[3:32] when things are going smooth
[3:35] uh it will end up without seeing any
[3:38] quality is
[3:46] [Applause]
[3:47] um
[3:49] I was asking about the
[3:53] Believers from
[3:55] Hawking
[4:02] and uh
[4:05] the announcement was maybe too late
[4:09] um foreign
[4:16] that is a condition
[4:20] you know if sometimes somebody comes to
[4:23] announce the death of a family member
[4:33] we don't say you announce it late
[4:40] now
[4:54] that that's when you know sometimes you
[4:56] wonder
[4:57] why Jesus Took only three
[5:00] actually three brothers
[5:02] up in the mountains
[5:10] why didn't he take all the people
[5:14] to show them
[5:16] their
[5:18] Transfiguration experience
[5:24] it is because
[5:26] it is according to the quality
[5:33] amen
[5:39] and you'll understand today
[5:44] why the people on the seventh seal are
[5:48] in the minority
[5:53] it's according to the quality
[5:58] amen
[6:01] um
[6:02] our brother stood here to announce
[6:05] us
[6:07] um
[6:10] but the utterances he made concerning
[6:13] the message were so sufficient to save
[6:16] anybody else is
[6:25] already the quality of that announcement
[6:30] um
[6:34] could raise a dead man
[6:37] um
[6:41] amen
[6:42] now this is the end time brothers and
[6:44] sisters
[6:50] recently I was called to Gabon
[6:56] especially to talk about
[6:58] [Music]
[6:58] um
[6:59] our
[7:01] to talk about the Lost inheritance and
[7:05] how
[7:06] to restore it
[7:09] um
[7:16] amen
[7:17] and so we had to fly some
[7:22] uh many many kilometers we have one
[7:25] young celebration
[7:27] for the purpose of talking about our
[7:31] inheritance amen
[7:36] and while we were there with vladama
[7:39] City
[7:42] there was a brother sent from a Cameroon
[7:48] foreign
[7:55] foreign
[8:10] has invented us
[8:18] this one says
[8:22] he wants me to come there and preach
[8:24] about the seventh seal or 49 years
[8:32] amen so it is in demand yeah
[8:38] man not everywhere
[8:42] but from the people
[8:44] to whom the Lord has predestinated
[8:49] so they want nothing else
[8:58] because it's a pool the pool of the day
[9:04] okay
[9:05] amen now uh we are we are going to look
[9:10] at the
[9:11] in these things so I'm glad that we are
[9:14] here a quality today we can see now it's
[9:17] only a quality
[9:19] and that is
[9:25] those who worship God unconditionally
[9:34] once in his preaching he said something
[9:37] striking
[9:44] he said what
[9:47] um
[9:48] the Most Blessed people are those that
[9:52] are
[9:54] in his presence
[10:02] then he said God bless those outside
[10:06] there
[10:10] but the Most Blessed ones
[10:18] so meaning that
[10:22] the stages there is some stages of
[10:25] blessings
[10:32] he says God bless them
[10:37] the Most Blessed people
[10:41] and those not on the radio
[10:46] not on the cell phone but those that are
[10:49] in his presence
[10:53] man the Queen of Sheba
[10:57] the queen of Shiva
[11:00] realized this when she met Solomon while
[11:04] Solomon
[11:06] and said blessed are the people that are
[11:09] in your house
[11:15] amen amen amen so this morning I feel so
[11:18] much blessed and I'm sorry
[11:22] under this trying conditions
[11:29] the Lord has
[11:32] it up to this
[11:35] house
[11:38] so that it can be among Transfiguration
[11:41] experience a
[11:45] The Experience yeah
[11:49] let me say to you one time
[11:53] Jesus spoke something oh yes
[11:57] he said to his disciples accept a man
[12:01] drinks my blood the blood of the son of
[12:04] man or
[12:06] and it is flesh he has no life
[12:17] after this saying the Bible says many
[12:21] how many left you
[12:23] 70 of his disciples left him and then go
[12:27] back
[12:32] now did you notice that Jesus didn't
[12:35] follow them in trying to explain to them
[12:39] um no
[12:48] would take
[12:51] and because 70 plus 12 makes
[12:56] 82.
[12:59] yeah now Jesus didn't need 82 disciples
[13:11] now he wouldn't say well you others I
[13:14] don't need you you can go buddy he said
[13:17] something that was a contrary to the
[13:21] others uh
[13:23] foreign
[13:32] so that's how you will do it every time
[13:38] he will say he will say something that
[13:41] will draw some other people away from
[13:44] him and also into Ezra when the money
[13:48] amen amen amen
[13:50] in order to remain with equality
[13:57] all right
[13:58] amen now
[14:01] we were
[14:03] talking I was talking to some brothers
[14:09] about these bodies of ours
[14:14] how God has shaped them up
[14:18] emotionally uh
[14:22] naturally
[14:24] now as we are here
[14:26] itches
[14:34] because I don't want to put too much
[14:37] heat to my body
[14:41] because I
[14:43] I want to hear the word of God
[14:47] amen
[14:49] the money
[14:52] I don't see this morning this body with
[14:55] a too much food
[14:58] um
[15:01] because I want to hear the word of God
[15:06] amen amen so you can you can condition
[15:10] your yourself for something into
[15:17] small
[15:29] so it depends there it depends on that
[15:32] he is
[15:39] we we have so much to do back home there
[15:44] uh
[15:47] but when
[15:51] received a call from this side from our
[15:54] fellow man of God foreign
[16:03] we were trying to say this and this but
[16:06] eventually we said we we should go there
[16:10] and meet with our brothers and sisters
[16:20] you know because the third pool is so
[16:23] active and putting us everywhere around
[16:26] the globe
[16:29] um
[16:34] as you are going to see it happening
[16:38] right here
[16:42] you know God start by shaping things and
[16:45] put them in the right
[16:48] sphere yeah
[16:53] and then uh
[16:59] what I hear from here or I've been
[17:03] hearing
[17:06] [Music]
[17:07] it is leading to something
[17:10] like
[17:13] language
[17:14] see as we read we are going to read here
[17:20] and
[17:21] the message
[17:23] shines better when the people are in the
[17:26] right condition
[17:28] um
[17:35] if you came here for the world and
[17:40] you left everything and forgot about all
[17:44] other things then God is gonna speak to
[17:47] you
[17:52] part of data now

[17:57] night

[18:40] yeah foreign
[19:22] his with

[21:58] her heart now

[29:44] let us bow our heads after reading we
[29:46] must talking to our Heavenly Father it's

[29:52] precious time to come before thee
[29:55] together with your children
[29:58] we are so glad that this day was
[30:01] specially chosen the father God for us

[30:16] doubt do we know better but we are here
[30:19] to share amen with the people
[30:22] whom we have seen before yes when we
[30:26] were together in those Realms of
[30:28] Eternity amen when God looked down and
[30:32] the sons and the Stars yeah look down
[30:34] and down and started to
[30:36] dance around the Throne of God when they
[30:40] saw their framework
[30:42] that the what God was gonna do amen and
[30:45] we believe that this morning was is also
[30:49] in the books in the book of the Lamb
[30:52] that this morning will be gathered here
[30:53] yes together we the Saints yes not to
[30:58] talk about anybody but they just to
[31:02] enhance what the Lord has already put in
[31:05] our handsome by believing him that they
[31:09] will remain in the stages as
[31:12] set up
[31:14] in order to take his church through some
[31:17] stages
[31:18] for the church to reach the climax and
[31:22] we are so glad this morning Father that
[31:25] the seventh seal has produced the climax
[31:28] and the climate as well
[31:32] as father we believe that we are here
[31:35] for
[31:36] share these things that they con that
[31:40] the Lord has done to
[31:43] concerning this time that we are living
[31:45] in bless the sisters brothers and under
[31:49] these conditions father we believe that
[31:52] they will feel the warmth of the word
[31:54] father that will most powerful more
[31:58] powerful you know that the conditions
[32:00] the human conditions pray for the
[32:04] blessings of upon the word that we have
[32:07] read in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[32:09] you may be seated
[32:12] amen amen
[32:15] brother Brittany one time
[32:19] let's say firstly
[32:23] I I was listening to the men of God here
[32:27] uh
[32:28] uh when he
[32:30] spoke about the stages
[32:34] although it didn't mean stages but I
[32:36] heard that he
[32:38] believes and he has seen that God comes
[32:41] in stages
[32:49] and
[32:51] even if you're reading the Bible in the
[32:55] Old Testament
[32:59] realize that God let his people in
[33:03] stages
[33:08] and each stage produced
[33:12] a special message for that stage
[33:16] [Music]
[33:20] um
[33:23] and we realize like brother Brennan
[33:26] speaks of the junction of time
[33:34] [Applause]
[33:35] it is in the junction when some people
[33:39] are crossing over some others remaining
[33:43] behind yes
[33:53] the dispute came at the junction yes
[34:03] the people who came together believe in
[34:06] the same Prophet but when it comes at
[34:09] the junction they started to stand
[34:12] family
[34:35] we're baptized together
[34:39] but they were coming through the stages
[34:48] they stood up against Moses
[34:52] amen amen and so this is the things I
[34:57] think as the children of God should look
[34:59] at yes this is
[35:04] then later we will look at the how
[35:11] the people some peoples the people
[35:15] separated and the final stage
[35:18] [Music]
[35:25] separating whilst while talking about
[35:28] the same thing the same message so
[35:35] but some others talking about the
[35:38] earlier stages of the message
[35:48] stage of the message
[35:56] who spoke about the Wilderness I
[36:03] against those who
[36:04] knows about that third part of it which
[36:07] is Canaan
[36:09] um
[36:14] so it's always the same thing it started
[36:17] back then
[36:20] let's look at the final stage of the end
[36:24] time message
[36:29] I want to give you that some title and
[36:33] the funeral the final stage
[36:36] the final stage
[36:39] of the end time message
[36:57] now we we are the
[37:00] bride of Christ
[37:03] but in which stage
[37:08] because the the the bride has was taken
[37:13] through some stages
[37:16] foreign now we sometimes need to sit
[37:20] down and look at the stage is
[37:26] because you want if you
[37:29] you understand what you are talking uh
[37:32] about if you don't know the stage that
[37:36] you are living in all the time that you
[37:39] are living is
[37:43] amen
[37:46] amen amen
[37:48] I was just saying in Gabon been decided
[37:52] [Music]
[37:54] that if you don't if you are not in the
[37:57] southern seal stage
[38:02] you have not given started to preach the
[38:05] message the message
[38:10] okay let's look at things now
[38:14] the final stage
[38:18] should be
[38:21] you know in a cycle
[38:25] is
[38:29] this ministry
[38:31] it's like a cycle lufana
[38:37] now in a cycle
[38:40] there is a starting point
[38:44] you go
[38:46] in a cycle
[38:48] we are we are you come back to the same
[38:51] point
[38:55] this is how God did his ministry how he
[39:00] brought about his ministry
[39:04] it will it starts from somewhere which
[39:07] we look at is
[39:10] to come back to the same
[39:15] amen now I will start reading to you
[39:18] something here
[39:20] as you are the message
[39:25] later will show that
[39:29] the prophecies
[39:31] when they reached
[39:34] the message
[39:36] was not Evangelistic
[39:41] amen
[39:43] you know here I'm here to talk to the
[39:47] people that are inside
[39:50] amen
[39:54] I respect an evangelist
[39:58] who goes out and say come to Jesus
[40:03] name is Canton all that she's Katie
[40:07] young girl he's talking to an unbeliever
[40:11] but when now the now now we are now here
[40:16] I'm I'm talking to the Insiders
[40:20] amen amen I can't imagine
[40:24] [Music]
[40:28] because you are the Insiders
[40:34] now as the Insiders
[40:36] I'm going to talk about the things
[40:39] that are found within yes
[40:45] [Music]
[40:48] foreign
[41:00] now if there is somebody
[41:04] even if even if it is his or her first
[41:08] time to come here nobody will
[41:12] happen if his name or her name is in the
[41:16] Lamb's Book of Life
[41:20] I tell you he's gonna or she's gonna
[41:23] catch up with the proceedings
[41:34] we will touch
[41:37] the original
[41:39] state state this is
[41:53] amazing amen they don't come because you
[41:57] condemn their their attire
[42:14] a prostitute
[42:19] now
[42:21] you know
[42:22] you all know about prostitutes
[42:24] [Music]
[42:26] you can't see them standing there
[42:29] carrying Bibles or so forth a
[42:34] amen amen have they are always half
[42:37] naked
[42:38] because they are there yet to attracted
[42:48] but this woman amen
[42:53] she has she
[42:55] you'd never find a reading the Bible
[42:59] she had a predestination
[43:06] then the Bible says if I believe
[43:10] she said in herself
[43:13] a messiah is coming
[43:17] and when he has come
[43:20] he he will tell us all things
[43:24] that's what was in that woman
[43:36] standing there with some shots
[43:40] for transparency
[43:44] in the highest hills
[43:47] um
[43:50] there was something
[43:53] that the Messiah is coming
[43:56] um
[43:56] [Music]
[43:58] amen so no church
[44:05] because she was waiting for the Messiah
[44:11] now there's some people here
[44:14] you were waiting for the seventh sea
[44:17] well then I
[44:20] I mean so no church can keep you I will
[44:26] uh
[44:29] you are made higher than just a
[44:32] denomination or a church
[44:38] now we'll read it here since I found the
[44:41] app because the message is beyond
[44:43] religion is
[44:48] religion can be any kind of worship
[44:59] religion
[45:03] and Christ is there seals that were
[45:06] revealed today who cries to Himachal in
[45:12] is not a religion I would
[45:15] imagine it's Christianity
[45:18] amen Christianity
[45:21] a Christian
[45:23] um
[45:24] if you are called a Christian
[45:27] that means you are Christ's like
[45:33] you are not a religionist
[45:35] a religionist
[45:38] um
[45:38] a person who believes things about God
[45:43] is
[45:47] but a Christian
[45:50] is a christ-like being
[45:52] a new Crest amen amen amen
[45:57] so
[45:58] let's read this
[46:01] the prophet speaks here let's start here
[46:04] uh I think it's page 64. I've got here
[46:08] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[46:12] and Page 64. oh yes
[46:15] amen
[46:20] I carry this book everywhere if I don't
[46:23] have it then you should carry it because
[46:26] I'm gonna ask it for it
[46:33] Christ
[46:44] is the mystery
[46:47] now he doesn't say Jesus is the mystery
[46:53] you'll see now what is the seventh seal
[46:55] because
[46:59] foreign
[47:22] amen because it's the same thing
[47:27] or the seventh seeds it speaks of the
[47:31] same thing
[47:33] we will read it it is in the spoken way
[47:36] since I found I will listen take away
[47:38] now amen the conflict
[47:43] is
[47:44] around the fact that that God said
[47:48] nothing about the seventh seal is
[47:56] foreign
[48:00] [Music]
[48:13] all right
[48:15] now
[48:16] but let's start here
[48:19] this is God's great mystery of Love
[48:23] expressed
[48:28] that God and Men became one
[48:32] um
[48:36] amen amen
[48:39] now we can stand therefore therefore
[48:41] ages
[48:43] God and Men became
[48:46] one
[48:50] amen
[48:53] some people
[48:57] as I
[48:58] discovered that the enough
[49:02] once said uh
[49:05] maybe I can use this name godima one
[49:08] certain kodima thinks that he is god um
[49:17] and I said
[49:19] but
[49:21] and I said um
[49:25] God himself said
[49:28] let us make men in our image
[49:33] away
[49:34] [Applause]
[49:36] now if you say somebody is making
[49:38] himself god
[49:40] um
[49:43] it is because you've never heard God
[49:46] when he said let us make men in our
[49:49] image
[49:56] now if God said that
[49:59] that means
[50:01] if you want to see a genuine man
[50:08] then you want to see a man who that is
[50:11] in the image who is in the image of God
[50:17] [Music]
[50:17] [Applause]
[50:24] [Music]
[50:28] thank you
[50:31] [Music]
