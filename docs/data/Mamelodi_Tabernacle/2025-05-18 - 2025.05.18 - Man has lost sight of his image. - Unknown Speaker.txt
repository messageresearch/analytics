[Music] You may be seated. God bless you. As we read the scripture. Oh, as we read. Amen. Amen. Chapter 3 from verse 14 to 15. I know that whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever. Nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it. And God doeth it that men should fear before him. That which hath been is now, and that which is to be hath already been, and God requireth that which is passed. Amen. Amen. God require that which is passed. The past. Amen. Amen. Amen. Uh he hasn't loaded us with a job. He's done it first. And said rejoice. You may be seated. God bless you. What a wonderful God we serve. I just read this part. Uh the Lord willing we shall continue next time. Firstly, man has lost the sight of his image image because you know it so special just to look at him before he opens his mouth as a predestinated seat. You you would have heard already what he has said. How can you miss to honor such a God that even even before he speaks you say amen. Amen. Why? Because he made sure that you are part of him. Maybe you don't understand being a part before I he says hallelujah hallelujah or before I say hallelujah. I have heard hallelujah already. Uh you remember that scripture where uh it says God created the garden of Eden. Now continue and you will hear what what what he say. Amen. Genesis chapter 2:8. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had fought. Amen. Amen. Oh, seated already. Thank you. God bless you. Amen. The Lord The Lord planted the garden. Planted a garden. Amen. Is what? He didn't go around looking for a garden. No. A gardener. He he didn't go around looking for a gardener. Amen. Amen. So he hired himself. But we were in him. He didn't establish a college for us. But he made us in this way that everything he is about to say, we are together with him. Amen. Amen. There's a song that says, "Amen." You know it. Which says, "All right, God bless you." Amen. When you remember, I remember it. I'll come back to you the church of God. Amen. We are so glad that the Lord Jesus is coming. Amen. That's why. Amen. That's why it keep keeps us in [Music] tears that some sing and say how long how long those who know him they sing this songs I'll be ready when Jesus comes. just for a sentence to say the Lord Jesus is coming. Amen. Amen. To us is a full gospel just to say he is coming. Amen. That's why there's such a joy in heaven. You won't think of coming back here. Once you can go to heaven, you will never think of coming back here. [Applause] But there are some who are there in him. That's why they won't fail because they were in him. Not in his house in his. He was in him in his garden. Amen. Amen. In everything he is. How many love Jesus? All right. Amen. The world can go there and there. I will never because I have tasted of him that to be his child and not his neighbor. We are not his neighbors. We are his children. Amen. The royal family of God. Hey children of Abraham, you know the children of Abraham, they were always rejoicing because the Bible says he looked for a city, not for a location. In Christ, we don't look for a location. We look for our city. Amen. Amen. And now because God has created that city already, you know before he could lead you to that city. He the seat was already in you. So that's why you are not being pushed to the sea. God won't say to his child, "Repent or I kill you or you don't want enter." No, no, no, no. That's to a sinner. But to his things are in his children. [Music] That's why if you I were asked to choose a pastor, I would pass I I would choose the one who is in me and I am in you. That's right. You know, before you think God has already passed over, but let's say to the child of God before God can say something. You have heard him already because you are part of him. That's why it is not repeat repeated to you. I said repent. No with a child of God. It's not. I said repent. I'm standing here like searching myself. My innermost so that my innermost should not get off the way of the Lord. But I'm not looking for that because if you are predestinated of God the law of God is already in you, you should not repent. Do this, do that, then you are not a child of God. Because if you are predestinated that means before God could say it is in you. [Applause] Amen. Jesus Christ the same yesterday. You'll never find him angry. Angry. No. So now I will read this part and uh in love towards the brethren. Here's something else here. Uh did we read which scripture did you read? God requireth that which is passed. Amen. Yes. Amen. God. Hey, did you hear he require that that is which is past which is passed. He will never come to you with a new thing and struggle to say didn't you hear I said no no no no what he speaks is already new but only what he will do is is to bring it in the form of a word but it's already All right. Amen. Every time we come to the service, we come with an expectation. Okay. Amen. I said I want I don't even have to look to the wristwatch because I'm I'm already almost there. Now that's why they say man has lost the sight of his image. All right. Amen. Did you hear? Man has lost the sight of his image. My image is Christ. Your image is Christ. Amen. Amen. So it is impossible for you to lose his image because it is by predestination. It is not you are you are not a scholar in Christ. A scholar can fail this. Amen. Amen. But a son is the blood of his own father. That that's a son. The blood of his father. We are the blood of Christ. So you can't say to the blood of Christ, bring tithe to love your brother. No, that won't work with the child of God. He was born with that thing in mind. If you plant a seed, you don't say, "I plant you." And I tell you, I want you to bring that wheat, no, that's not the wheat. That's not wheat. Wheat is seed already. You just plant it. in order to do what? To grow. Amen. That's right. Amen. After planting, you don't see whe I don't I won't beg you come forth. No. Once you plant you plant, the law is all is is already working. Mhm. Amen. Hey, our God is wonderful. Once you hear the gospel, not the church gospel, the seed gospel. You didn't hear. I didn't hear the seed. The seed. What we God wants is seed to serve him. The Bible says this seed shall serve [Applause] you and you don't force the seed of God to serve you. No, it is the working of the seed of God that's in you that will do the job. But you know, you see sometimes I used to worship at certain denomination. Everything is forced upon you. Don't wear mini skirt. Hallelujah. Don't. No. That's not God seat. God's seat is the word. It's not what a preacher force you to do. No, it is God. You know, brother. Yes, sir. uh he planted seed seed he planted seed he didn't ask any farmer to because that farmer that farmer can even plant [Music] marijuana so it should be his own seat That's why God hates [Music] adultery. For God never said to somebody, "Plant me a seed." No, he is his own seat. A real child of God. is not forced to do any good thing. It is the seed the nature in him. Amen. Amen. You know there at the denominations you are taught to recite what do you call it? Prayer after a teacher. for God loved the world. Then you say after him, you don't have it. You say it after the teacher with God is not what he says. It's already in you. He doesn't come and plow. Then after afterwards he says there you see I work hard for you. No no no no. No the seed of God has God's life in it. Yeah. A a brother one time Uh he was talking about something in the church uh which is not good for a believer to wear. After some few days she was back on it. Amen. Amen. Then I said, "Brother, I was talking to a brother. I said, you know, the seed of God, uh, you don't force it. A person you have forced to do something is not a Christian. A Christian is not forced to do right. That is his life. Amen. Amen. You don't force wheat to become wheat. No, it is wheat whether you water it or not and then God will water you if it is a righteous seed. Now in closing as I have promised now here the Bible says h if a man keep my saying he shall never see death. Amen. Because you know if God says something to you, it is both seed, life, resurrection. You know his seed is like that. So he he will plant once seed life. Amen. Amen. If then it is needful for you to have resurrection resurrection, it is in that seat. Sit. Okay. Amen. Now before I close here, it is like I remember one day I was at the church and uh the man there was battling with the members in his church. If you don't bring tithes, then he threw the the tie from. Amen. Amen. He's tired because of anger. You think I just come here to play? Now I was with brother I said this is not God's word and it's not God's church God's church is not shamb if you plant in your You don't say I'm here I don't want to hear anything then we will say we take table and sit down. Yeah. And some saying Leave him to preach on say he's not preaching. He's not preaching. After you have planted in your garden, we don't hear while passing by. We hear you saying, "I have planted you and we will take you out of the garden." No sir. Yeah. Take and go arrested. Yeah. This is church. I started but this is not of God. It's a church. But it's not of God. It is your [Applause] the Lord Jesus doesn't push us in order to do right. We are a seed. Amen. That's why Bible says the seed of Abraham, he didn't buy it from the seed of Abraham shall produce seed Abraham. Mhm. Amen. If it is of Abraham, it will bring forth the nature [Music] of the same seat because that's how bring God does things. Mhm. You don't have to struggle a brother one day when I was with the Assemblies of God people there uh we were going we were going somewhere for a revival Then he said to me, "Hey brother, you know this young people is better if they can ask me to preach." Yeah. I said, "No, no, brother. The seed of God came from God. You don't make it a seed. Amen. You water. Amen. Amen. The the Lord has produced it. Your job is just to water. But a seed that came through that force. Amen. Amen. Be baptized in life. Um, I know I I was with such things until I said to God, "Lord, if then this is the way I should go to heaven, then I sorry." [Applause] Amen. Amen. Then when I The first spoken word I have received God of this evil age I remain home and said if then man is to be forced to become a child of God then I won't go that way and then afterwards when I started now to read the Bible wanting to see it. Then I found the truth. Since then I just relaxed. Amen. Amen. You know a seed once it can do something it in turn corrects itself because it has the nature of God. Amen. Amen. Now I was with my friend Johannes. Then they were going to attend this what they call youth services. If you can ask the people today maybe coming from what they call revival you hear them complaining. I'm talking about things that I have experienced. I was with a brother So uh we were going somewhere now. He said let us pass by my father's house because my younger brother he's attending a revival somewhere. Amen. Amen. So I said yes brother but because we are going somewhere it should not be a prolonged. All right. Amen. While I was waiting for the brother with a hot coffee outside there, the young man has just arrived a younger brother to the morning. Amen. Amen. While we were there, I heard from inside the house the father Their father was not a believer. Is this Lutheran you know they preach only after they have taken at last. So in the house the father was shouting to his son I will never give you money again for going to this church of yours then that one no daddy what must I do if I don't go to church it's the same thing you go to church you come back you are still cheeky you are still Now I don't see any difference. I'll keep my money. Yeah. And he was uh coming out of the house saying this and that and that. And the older elder brother says my father is angry. I said why? says, "Didn't you hear her shouting?" I said, "Yes, I did." Says, "My father, if you go to church, he believed that coming back from church, you are a better Christian." I said, "No." Uh, does this what you call Yeah, mar. Yes, that's right. Now this young man, you yourself told me that your younger brother smokes marijuana. Now what do you expect? All right. He says, "Brother, now what do you think we should do now?" I said, "No, he must believe God. Give his life to God. Otherwise, he'll keep on smoking. Even the the day he's coming back home from somewhere, he will bring he will smoke too much of this stuff in preparation to ask to answer his father. When he opens the father at night time, he says, "Yeah, I knew I knew. You see father now how can I love you if you treat me well he says trying to treat you well is just to I be treating marijuana well all Right. Let me come to the end of this until we we I have promised. Now in the Bible, we read about seeds, the seed of Abraham. Now if God don't trust Abraham, he will never say such words. Because the people will come tomorrow and say, "Didn't you say he's the city of God?" Well, let let us give him chance. Do you do you give seed chance? No, it is seed. Chance and all this are in this You don't have a seed. You don't have outside of this seat something outside to make it better. No seed. You don't paint seed. No, you don't become polite to the seed in order to make it better. The seed of God will spiritually resemble God. Uh-huh. Amen. So that's how it should be like. Now in closing here that's why I read some here says man has lost the sight of his image. Then I said, "Yeah, that's but it doesn't work for a sinner." Because sinner, a sinner is not the image of God. He was born a seed. If it is of God then you know some people they believe I say I will tell brief something here in Modi where I used to live. There was this old man, a very good old man. And now I every time talking to his children would say be like me. Can't you see that I'm pray for? Yeah. Pray for us. Then before they eat, they bring food before they eat. Yeah, we also want to be like you would say. All right, let's pray. Oh, heavenly father, not knowing that he's referring to his father. Amen. Amen. Okay. Now, yes, the not the end of it, but we will look at it next time. Man has lost the sight of his image. The image of God or the image of a child of God is is Christ is God. Is Christ. Now if it is the image it is born an image you don't nothing can make a seat him a seat. Hey, let me say this. Brothers and sisters, do you know that nothing can make somebody a Christian? No. You can buy somebody some suits and what what say my son, you know, if you can go to church in ah you'll see wonders. yesterday in his mind he is thinking of a that he has seen. Yeah. Amen. If you can say to your child, if you can do the right thing, I'll buy I'll buy you a suit. A suit. Yes, daddy. What do you want me to do, daddy? Not that he wants to do a good thing. No, he wants a suit and the father say, son, I'll get you one right now. The father will rush to town to buy him a suit. When he arrived back with the suit, then the boy will say, "Oh, daddy, daddy, I love you." He loves the suit. Not this. Amen. Even after wearing it, you say, "Daddy, how do I look like daddy?" Amen. Amen. And then daddy said, "Yeah, my boy, my my son." not knowing that the suit is for a girl. Girl, yeah, it's for a girlfriend. The first thing when he leaves straight to the girlfriend, I look like You know, amen. You know, you look like Roy Rogers. Rogers. Ah, thank you, love. All right. Amen. But this love is talking about the love of the suit. Okay. Amen. Now in closing like this, how many love God? Amen. I am loved by God. It is something you know even when I'm alone sometimes you think maybe I am mad or what just the joy of being a child of God. Because if you are a child of God by birth is different from if you call yourself a son. Amen. By not birth. Okay. You know many people that are in the church they it is not by birth because by birth it will say you are the seed of Abraham. Amen. Then that is by birth but not birth of the flesh. I was saying to a brother when coming here That brother I've seen somebody wearing a suit but he has stolen my money to buy that suit. All right. Can I read the last he bought? He stole money to buy that. Should I sit next to him and I I hear him when the minister preach. Amen. Not you. No. What have I done? bring my soup. Amen. Amen. Then I called the deacons and arrest him. Okay, brothers and sisters. It is so wonderful to be with you. You know that's why they say, but I won't dwell on this now. Man has lost the sight of his image. Man made you in his God made you. God made you in his image image. But if I can say to you, prove to me that he's a child of God, how are you going to do it? I must preach and see how you react. Amen. Amen. That's the only way I can prove. Yeah. Amen. Because everybody can say, "Yeah, I'm also a child of God, brother." Yeah. I said, "All right, let me preach." After preaching, said, "Did you hear the gospel?" Yeah. But you just stole my shoes. I [Music] was You'll hear some stories. Uh I don't want to read further more although there is still the the the thing we will continue with next time man has lost I I mean men has lost the sight of his image. God bless you. So God requires the that which is past the past that which is past because it will never change. It was planted by God. Right. Amen. So brethren, I won't take it further, but the Lord willing, we will come back one day to continue here and go to Genesis. God made man in his own image. It doesn't say God made man in the image of his father. No, but it says in the image of God in his own image possibly the nature will be of God. Now if the nature is of God like the Lord Jesus had apostles and did you see how he did it just coming there to the was it the river or the sea and said Peter follow me because the seed is already there. Did you hear him saying, "Hey, how are you, sir? Who are you, sir?" No, no, no, no, no. Peter, Peter, follow me. And Peter, take the natural fishing staff and follow Jesus. You know this other one where Jesus said before Philip called you Philip called I haveen you I've seen you Amen. meaning that when this man was born God was looking Now when the time arrive you don't hear Jesus saying Philip quit smoking man no you said Philip follow me then the Lord turned this way Philip just stood up and followed to the end of the journey if you plant seed You plant it. Then you say follow me. Next week you find that the thing has turned to something else. So that's not which be ready. Let's go higher. As we stand up, [Applause] [Music] tell me brother, are you ready? [Music] I'll be ready. I'll be ready when she brother. We are closing now. It is because myself I am ready and I know nothing. can turn me around. You know, you must have that uh what do you call it? Assurance. Assurance. Because the person you are singing you say I'll be listening to. Uh there was uh something at the home of my friend. Amen. Amen. But it was not a friend in Christ. It was a friend in in the bottle. Amen. So his father was a just a Lutheran like that, you know, and we were together one day and because I was also still young knowing not the right or wrong, I said, "Are you also a go like your father. So yeah, what do you mean? Even he bought me something last week for attending church with him. I said, bro, I didn't talk about attending church. I said, "All right, we'll talk one day." Uh, invite your family. to Christ. I didn't say to attend. Amen. No, I'm saying talking to your family men. You don't say, uh, don't you want to go to church with me? No. Tell him, "I want to go to heaven with you." Because going to church with you won't change me. But to go to Christ, that will change me. Amen. Amen. Are we up on our feet? Oh, yeah. Yes. Amen. I'll be ready. [Music] Oh, be ready when Jesus come. I'll be ready. I'll be ready. I'll be ready. I'll be ready. I'll be ready [Music] when singing. If you want a prayer and you just raise your hand, my hand and say, "Lord, I want to be like you." Amen. He won't refuse. He won't refuse. [Music] Would you mind coming forth for a prayer? I'm I'm rich. Amen. Okay, let us pray. Amen. Heavenly Father, gracious Lord, you are a merciful God. Yes, Lord. A loving God. You've you've been with us, Lord, all these years. There was a time where, Lord Almighty, we turn our backs from you. Amen. Not knowing where we are going, but you extended your merciful love and brought us back to the fold. Amen. Not only to the fold, Father, but Lord, bless us with the right ministry. Not only the right ministry, but the relevant one. Not of the past, but the present one, Lord. And here is it.
