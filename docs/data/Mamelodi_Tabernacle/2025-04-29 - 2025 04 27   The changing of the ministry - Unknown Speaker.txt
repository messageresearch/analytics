I'm sure together we will just fellowship and then God bless you all and and thank you all for your attention. May the Lord bless you straight away. We'll go to the word. I would like our brother to read the book of John chapter 3. Let us read from verse 22 to verse 272. Over to you my brother. Amen. After this, after this things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea, and there he tried with them and baptized. And John also was baptizing in Anum near Jerusalem, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized, for John was not yet cast into prison. Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. And they came unto John and said unto him, Ravi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou beest witness, behold the same baptizing, and all men came to him. John answered and said, A man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven. Amen. Let us bow our heads. Gracious Lord, Amen. We are together again. Yes, we are here in this tabernacle. That reminds us of your disciples. Lord, there was a day when they were in the upper room. They were one mind. Amen. One spirit and they were one accord and we are here Lord in this tabernacle with one accord. Amen. One mind and one spirit and because of that Lord that attract attracted you when you see your children being one spirit. Yes. And that spirit is yours. That is why father you came down and sat upon each and every one of them and they received you and you receive them back to yourself. And here we are Lord Almighty this morning. We invite you Lord that you come down and receive us. Amen. so that we should receive of yourself. No man can ever preach to your bride. We pray that you yourself Lord come and preach to your bride. Thank you father. We pray thanking you in the precious name of my lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Okay, you may be seated. God bless you. Uh my uh title this morning uh is uh the changing of the ministry. The changing of the ministry Now if I may ask a question, where is our ministry right now? When we say there is a changing of the ministry, just write the time and then changing from what to what. I just want us to fellowship about that because we we can't keep on coming to the service and being not in line with what is is is happening. We must uh have an understanding Because we are in a journey. We are uh uh on a pilgrim, right? Amen. Then we should know how far are we to reach our destination and how far are we from where we started if there ever is any start because as we move on there's a shift ing. There is a changing of the ministry from one level to another from one dimension to another. And as the levels are changing, there is something that is happening to our bodies. Amen. There's something that we receive. The Bible says our mortal bodies are deteriorating. As our mortal bodies deteriorate, there is a new man that is built within us. Amen. Luke born our Lord Jesus Christ, the body of our Lord Jesus Christ was put in a grave. But when Mary and the disciples went there, they find a napkin there. The clothing were there, but the body was buried there. And where was our Lord then? He was uh on the way to Emos speaking with his disciples and his disciples were not aware that he was wearing a body and he spoke to them. And the only way that they could have a knowledge who is this [Music] man was that he took the scriptures from Moses and as he was speaking there was something that was built within them. Because the Bible says there was something that was happening to them. Now, last time I read the scripture. I I I quoted the scripture in Isaiah. I think it's 28 that says 28 precept upon precept, line upon line, there a little, here a little. Now that thing when you are here in the service there's something that is building within you. You know you know Moses said to the children of Israel the angel of the Lord will always be with you. Please be careful. Do not disturb that. And the Bible says to you, the angel of the Lord is encamping. All right. Amen. So now where is our ministry right now? Okay. We have read here verse 22 says verse 22 after these things came Jesus and his disciples unto the land of Judea and there he tried with them and and baptized. No he terried with them and baptized. Right. Amen. 23 23 And John also was baptizing. [Music] Jesus was baptized. John was baptized. Now it's the changing of the ministry. It's another dispensation. Jesus is now taking forth. John is subsiding. The what makes them to change. It's a new dispensation. Their ministry is not the same. Are we together now? As we move on, we should be careful of our ministry because our ministry now has to do with a changing of the body, right? It says here now John also was baptizing why Jesus was baptizing. So now is the crossroad junction right? Amen. But the only people that understand what was going on, it was John and Jesus because they communicated. But on another level when John was baptizing Jesus, they communed the two of them. And when they were communing, those that were there could not understand their Lord because John was saying, "I can't baptize you." There's something that he saw. He saw a light. He saw a spirit. He saw a promise. coming down. Amen. So he was forunning somebody but he was waiting to see who is that man that I'm God says this is the man and the Bible says behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and his name shall be called Wonderful counselor, the mighty God. John knew that he will be the mighty God. How can he baptize the mighty God? That is why he was saying I can't baptize him. But what did Jesus say? Let's do it. Let us continue do it for the for the sake of the word. They they are now changing. They are exchanging the baiton. John is giving the baiton to the right person and the right person take this bait. So you must be able that you are carrying a baiton and what are you supposed to do with the bait you are having right? Amen. John was baptizing. Jesus was verse 23. And John also was baptizing in Enim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized. Verse 24. For John was not yet cast into prison. Now remember the communication had nothing to do with I. It was the weight. Our Lord was there to confirm the promise, the way it to show who he is. Because if he says I am so and so, somebody will judge him because of the history of the parents. Look, even with you, your the prophet says our great greatgrandparents were born in sins. Now we were also born in sin. All of us. That's it now. Amen. That's why we had to take a new route. There was a physical birth, a supernatural birth. There's a physical body and a supernatural. There is a physical dimension dimension, supernatural dimension. We have to know that. We have to know that now. In which dimension are we now? In which dispensation are we now? In which ministry are we now? In which faith are we now? Because the Bible says we move. We are in a journey. We move from faith to faith. Right? Amen. Now we should reach a faith that will change our remember first Corinthians chapter 15 chapter 15 verse 45 says verse 45 Adam was a living soul and the second Adam is a quickening of spirit the spirit that we have. It's a quickening one. Quickening is the changing of the body. There are things that will happen around us. When things which are spiritual things that are happening around you know that you have won a battle, Avenger [Music] even when the signs are showing [Music] negatively slow as a spiritual person when he tries to target me and the angel of the Lord is know who you are. verse 25. Then there arose a question. You see the the changing of the ministry that draws his [Music] own power of God. We have thees and and we had John and we had Jesus ministries. went to a certain place where they worship ancestors. So he looked around, he saw their such and then they went to see are causing commotion with your ministry. Okay, come and tell us about this ministry of yours because it's confusing. We are helping people here in a ministry that we confuse now that was moving now from one [Music] child who created So when the ministry [Music] changes Never confuse you. You are the citizens. You are the You are the seed. If you come to a point where you get confused and ask yourself, who am I? Why am I confused? In that moment where the prophet says the word is in [Music] [Music] meus hanging on the cross. They said there is come down. You raise the dead. You You have You multiply. You multiplies. in this book. 1959 what our Lord was on his knew what he was doing. He was not intimidated by the people that says come down in the next one was hanging with him. Never intimidate child. [Music] Now 26. And they came unto him that was beyond to whom bear [Music] witness the same baptis and all men come to him. Now yesterday people say all men are rushing to it because of the dispensation and it is because a prophecy is fulfilled. When I say the prophecy is fulfilled, I say is it proved for itself. I'm doing the right thing to be done because theians are following the prophecy and the manifest. You know what the prophet said? The [Music] you let me read you. this book on the seven page. It says [Music] the messenger will reveal the mysteries of and those who receive that prophet in his own will. Those that receive That prophet in his own will receive the benefies. And those who receive that prophet now to receive that prophet is not to say. Yes. To know a person is not to know the image. So the messenger will reveal the mystery of and those who receive that prophet in his own will the prophet in his own will. Then you will receive the benefit. That is the beneficent effect of that prophet's certain levels of ministry. that you will not be rich without complying. [Music] There is certain of the ministry that you will not receive. Can't reach that open comp now. The Bible says men come to him. There were three ministries. Now it says when Jesus wasapt Now what's attracted is the manifestation of it knows that it's certain time I'm going to do this. You don't go there by your intents right that's how is the faithful that's God said, "Let us make [Music] man after our says that somebody can manifest it in. He believed that the word must be disbelieved in the garden of men. Let it be like that. And the bride said, "Let it be." And the prophet says, "There is once you receive it, the level of faith goes up. change because there's a dimension that is a certain dimension. So now there's something that [Music] is never the same. The doors are closed. You couldn't come. Sorry. No, I I came by mistake. There's no way that you could do a wrong thing. The pastor was saying his brother with his [Music] friend to the house and then funeral you know I don't know what you call it where you identify the cops move on when they come their time come They open up my shoes. No, it's not you. So there won't be a mistake with you. your heaven. So now you see how powerful was his ministry. very that very same ministry is of Jesus. It's of Christ. That is what we call these ministry of the preacher. No, he said follow me. never and when you preach in parable in the afternoon evening then you relax and sleep on his starting and then we say why do you preach in parable us. Hallelujah. When we preach in the preach and preach and when he brings the ministry home and preach [Music] Jesus will visit me. Martha and Lazarus. And one of the sisters will sit on his feet and listen and grumble and then the other one will grumble. [Music] She was sitting [Music] there and when she was sitting there she was hearing words from the temple. Amen. [Music] [Music] There's a dimension called dimension called and there's a place Dimension Dimension Dimension. [Music] There was I was reading where it says a man come to him and then what did Jesus say John answered and said man can receive nothing except [Music] given nothing except it's given you a heavenly [Music] let's read uh the book of Romans Before we read that, let me give you another example. You [Music] know, there was a time Remember [Music] that's what you Meditate. Don'tate your challenges. As long as we are in this Amen. [Music] [Applause] Amen. The book of Daniel Daniel in the third year of the reign of Jehovah king of Judah came and besieed and the Lord gave king of Judah into his hand with part of the desert of the house of God into the land of chapter 9. In the first year of the son of Abus of the state of the which was made king over the realm of the ins of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he will accomplish 70 years in the desation of Jerusalem. [Music] When was supposed to be taken? So was that you would be taken There was nothing that could [Music] preach. The ministry was going to tell them that they going out the ministry of the seven seed. There's nothing else that is to tell you that your body's been quickened. There's nothing else that you could preach is the quickening. Right? Amen. And when Daniel was in Egypt and he was in Babylon, he was the prophet there and then he was reading the books going on reading the books. Now read verse two. Verse two. The first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by books the number of the years. Yes, he understood by books. He read the books of of of the prophet Jeremiah that tells that now we need to go out. We we we read and we still reading the books that says at the end time this is what going to happen. And we know that we are at the end time. Daniel was in Babylon, but he knew it's the end of slavery. We have to go home. It was a prophecy. He believed that prophet. He read the books and then from there on he understood. You see when he understood he went to pray. Now the prayer was relevant to what was happening there. There is no way that God could not answer you when you pray relevantly and there's no way that God cannot bless you when when you are embraced by the relevant ministry because you're doing what God says. do. And when you're doing what God says, God is bound to answer you. He's bound to answer your request. He's bound to answer your your your your prayer. That's why when Daniel went to the river with his friends to go and pray, he was certain that is right. You see? Amen. So he knew that I am right and he knew that he was talking to God. And you know what the the Bible says? It says, "Let your prayer be heard." When you pray, let your prayer reach the destination. You don't pray because you're supposed to pray. You pray because you want to speak to your father and you know that your prayer will reach this destination only your father will answer you will not you don't say maybe you know when you pray talking to your father right amen now the ministry of Daniel when he was at the river praying. He was with friends. Some of them there was the ones that that accompanied him, they were just accompanying them because when the angel came, they ran away. How can when when God comes you and you were praying all this time God answer us? Here we are Lord. And the Lord comes and then you run away. Right? And it was only Daniel that remained and hate. Remember when when when [Music] when uh Paul when he was still Saul, he was on his way, Jesus came. They all fell down. Some ran away. Jesus was coming. They ran away because it was not their ministry. The dispensation was of Paul. When Jesus came, go straight to Paul and say, "Paul, Paul, s why persecute me." So there was a communication between Saul and Jesus. So when the the the the the heavens open, the seven angels came down. Seven angels that came down. You know that your angel was there. Angel was there. Now you can't refuse your angel. We have this photo of those seven angels in our homes. Why are we displaying that? Because we are there. That is part that is part of us. Amen. And when I'm there, I'm supernatural. One day I was visited by a sister at home. When she came in, she said, "Take out that phone." And she started rolling. Prayer didn't just look at that phone. No, no, no, no, no. Because the fire, the logos is there. But it all depends whether you have it in yourself because you are part of it. There's a connection with you with those seven angels. Those seven angels is your theophony. And now when we preach is that theophony it's a communication. That is why it's not come to Jesus. That is why right now if somebody doesn't want to to the line you give him the word the word will grind him will work on him. There is life in the word. Jesus says the words that I speak. They are spirit and they are alive those words are spirit and they are alive and they will go for their own and and pull unto themselves. Are we together? Jeremiah's message was in uh was a a dispensation. So but when it reaches Babylon, it became another ministry and pulled them back to the promised land. That is why now Romans 11:17 says there, let's go to Romans 1:17. So I I think you you should know that now the changing of the ministry. Uh it lines up with a a a particular dispensation and and also the level of your faith. It changes your faith. Amen. You know there's a a wavering faith and then there is a faith that has reached the destination. That's that's why the prophet speaks about the sixth sense. I've got five senses. But there's another one which is the sixth one. When that one, it's always reach. It's to the point once you move away from it, you think. Jesus said to Peter, he was walking upon the sea. He said, "Came, come, come, come. Peter faithfully faithfully walk. But once the faith start wevering and on now keep the faith because the Bible says we move from let's read it. Let's read it here. I say chapter one. Yes. Let's read uh what from verse uh 16h. Amen. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. For it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth. Amen. To the Jew first and also to the Greek. Listen to verse 17. 17. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith. As it is written, the just shall live by faith. Amen. Now it says the righteous of God is revealed from faith to faith. You move on. It shoots from one faith on until you enter new Jerusalem. pushes you right let's read again I want to read these scriptures then I will comment uh let's go to the book of first Corinthians uh and and let's read also verse 17 if if I've got it right verse 17 first Corinthians verse seven chapter 9. Sorry. Chapter 9. Chapter 9. Verse 17. Verse 17. Let's read it to you, brother. For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward. But if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me. Now, it says here, uh, I want you to listen carefully. says is it chapter nine my brother? Amen. Verse six verse 17. Yes. For if I do this thing willingly I have a reward. That's what Paul says. And there's a hyphen there. It shows that it's not uh that sentence is not finished. It's still continuing. Amen. But if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me. Now Paul was chosen to a youth dispensation dispensation. Now when he is chosen to that dispensation whether it's his will or not he has been chosen for that dispensation. Look if if if I was chosen to be coana Even if I will admire and want to be I want I'm chosen to be. Now if you are chosen to be the bride of Christ, you won't change. The relevant things, the relevant promises will be yours. And there won't come a time where it dist. No. You will know them. You know what? Brother Brenham, brother Brennham went to the sixth dimension. He met people. They knew each other in a different dimension. They were not surprised. Look, we come from one point. We were in the mind of God. We were together in the mind of God. The Bible says he is the rock. You can't turn away from the rock from which you come together and together the Lord would come. What is going to happen in new Jerusalem? It what was happening before we come to this it speak about the the water the river of life and the water of life. It speaks about the tree that will bear fruit and that water of life coming right from the throne of God. And Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, "Give me water to drink." She said, "No, you are a Jew." And then he said, "If you knew who is this man, I will give you a water that when you drink it, you will never thirst." We are going to a place where now the life that comes from his throne, we will always give us life. those that will be out of New Jerusalem. They will come into that tree and take a fruit. It's not a physical is the life. When I want to have a discussion with God, I want to walk and go into his throne. He won't walk and come to where we are. We just meet when God in the garden of Eden was coming to to to to Adam. He didn't walk. Neither was Adam walking. Adam saw God. Are you aware that right now God is in you? You are and you are communicating with God on daily [Music] basis. You don't walk and go to him. Neither do you walk and go to him. You are one in the same thing. That is why Jesus said I and my father. Right. Amen. And when Philip said, "Show us the father said, "Philip, when you see me, you see the father." Finishing. Amen. When you see the bride, you see the father. Because the father is the word. In the beginning was the word was with God. The word is God. The word is now in you. The father is now in you. Now the enjoyment that we'll be having is the very enjoyment that we are having. The only difference is that we won't remember this. He said it won't be remembered. The past won't be remembered because it will joy. Unspeakable joy. Now, how can you claim to be the citizen of New Jerusalem? Jerusalem, why you don't have joy? Why you hate each other? Why you gossip about each other? Why you don't see the relevance of the way? It's your way. Look what is the church. The church is the Holy Ghost. The church is yours. You are the church. When God want to relax and and commune, he commune with you. There's nobody else. He just put a thirst in you. And then you think, "No, I must go to my room. I must go and pray down and say Lord start talking with your God. Talking with your God. Even at night, what can wake you up? You won't hear a hand shaking. It is yourself. Say rather let me pray. Rather, let me read. God shook you up. And when you read there, he will show you what to read. So you are with God 24/7 27. 24/7 you are with God 247. Right. Amen. Don't ever entertain negativity. Stay positive. That's why the prophet says you got to watch what man says and what God says. God gave you a promise. God gave you a good life. God gave you, you know, everything. He gave you joy. Is the devil that want to take your joy? God gave you whatever it is. [Music] Are we together? So now when we change from this dispensation there will be another ministry changing of the ministry. That's why now Isaiah 28 28 from verse 19 it says precept upon precept. Amen. You go to Philip chapter 4 verse 6 verse 6 he says let your request be known when you pray your God let your request right amen the prophet says in the book of seals in paragraph 233 paragraph 233 He says everything runs out in this time. Is the end of church ages the end of the seven, the ends of the trumpets, the end of the v in the end of into the [Music] minia. Amen. Uh let me have that. Uh uh I think I've got uh what you call brother brothers the the what I want to display here. That's the three and a half I'm in the 70th week of Daniel. I think I've got it there. The 70th week. I just want to say something about tongue is t is tighter. Yeah. Yeah. That's the one. Amen. That's the one. Now the left. The one on your left. No. No. The one on your on your right. You are facing that side. Me. Me. It's my left. Abraham. Abraham. Those are the Jews. Yeah. doing good thing to show it. Amen. They were waiting for the Messiah. Right on top. There's an X there. He came as the son of man. But God blinded the eyes of the Jews so that we could be crafted. Come to the Gentiles, my friend. And we're given the first, the second up to the second church age and then thereafter we cross over to the sea you see now. So now what is what what's next to come is the rapture. There we are. We go. Now we cannot go to the rapture with this body and we are in that ministry that prepares us to go. The ministry has to do with a change. Are we together? Amen. That is the seven. Now the pyramid has been kept. That is why now the pastor is always on that pyramid. He says you are the pyramid pyramid. So when he says you talking about your theophanes, somebody said unto me, you people say God is in you. Meanwhile, the Bible says he will descend. Now, how come that is in you? Because the Bible says he will descend. They miss one thing. The prophet says that God is God is potentially in you. in the form of the word because the Bible says in the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. The word was God in you. In the form of the word. But now one day God in the form of the image he will come down. The word that is here is his part. Are you together? He will come to to to come and fetch the word but it will be in the sky. Now that word is the one that pulled off the napkins and the word when they went to the grave. It was not there. Are we together? Amen. And that word will leave this planet earth and will leave the world and somebody else will come and take over. You see the prophet will always touch these three things. He will touch the white house. The white house the white house which is in America. And he will touch the Kremlin which is in Moscow Moscow. And he will touch the Vatican which is in Rome. You see the people that control this world is the white house is the Kremlin is the Vatican. Now the prophet says the Kremlin will destroy the White House White House and the Vatican and the government will be one. Because he says, "Watch Russia, king of the north." He says, "A king of the north." He will destroy the Vatican. Now, what what is that? It's one and the same thing. They prepare it together and destroy the unwanted then it would be a new covenant. Let's let's come to that what you call right now after the rapture. Then the ministry goes to the now from 1 to 7 he is here in the form of the Holy Spirit. and he is the son of God. But you go up to the red part where the seven seals then the ministry changes from the seven church ages to the seals. Then he becomes now son of the revealed word is the son of man that kept still there. is the son of man. The ministry of the son of man will rapture us. That son of man that was in the Jews. The other one on the left, my brother. That one? No, no, no. That one. Yeah, that one was rejected. After the rapture, you will come over here. Right. Right. Right on the right one. That's it. Amen. That's where now to the Jews because God blinded them. We could be crowned. Are we together now? And then after our rapture, there's the battle of go and right after that battle and actually after the rapture is the song that you sing, behold, I'll send you Elijah the [Music] prophet before the great and dreadful day of after the rapture. starts the great and dreadful death. Moses came and preached to the Jews. Moses and Elijah only 144,000. Amen. That will repent then that will be the rapture of the Jews because Moses and Elijah will be killed will lie on the street days and then a voice will call them from heaven captured. Then there comes the battle of Armageddon. Then after the battle of Armageddon, then it's back to the garden of Eden which is millennia. Are we together? Now we had such as Yes. Paul says, he says we've got great promises. The promises that we have. I like that scripture. Let me read it so that I should close. It's it's the book of second Peter chapter one chapter one verse four verse four whilst you are bringing the prophet speaks about the stars of heaven on revelation we'll do that next week I mean sometime when we've got time read it verse four whereby are given and unto us exceeding great and precious promises. Look what he says, great and precious great. Look, brother or sister, you have great and precious promises that by these you might be the pac of the divine nature. This is there are promises that will give you will take out the nature and give you the divine nature. May the Lord bless you. [Applause] Uh uh worship team. Amen. Do you know this song? Uh maybe you might not know it. There's a place called heaven and dimension called seven. [Laughter] Okay. Oh, no. Okay. Next time, I'll give it to you next time. There's a place called And there's another one that says, "I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going. Those two. Can you practice it? God bless you. Yeah, you can continue. I'm going home. Oh, I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. Amen. Amen. They wait here. Amen. Amen. Amen. Can we just say the day of redemption is here while we ask our elder to say a word of prayer. Amen. Amen. [Music] for Jesus. [Music] Your redemption is here. Your redemption is [Music] We feel the [Music] spirit of glorious. [Music] and the baby [Music] for the spirit and [Music] Oh God of [Music] glorious. [Music] Amen. Fore message. come up to that level that used to meet with you. You were you were already changed. for your angel was here once again in this pulpit. There is an angel in this pullpit. When the pastor said the elder so and so is going to preach is just as the same. When Elza go and look for Rebecca Elza the angel of Abraham. Abraham there was an angel. It was impossible. I 318 thousands and thousands. Gater is he that is in you than the one who is in the world. One child of God. All hell can come. It will never defeat him or her because all heaven is in that child of God. We know as the pastor said go and preach. He was directing that angel. He must go and use the disco today. Father God, we are blessed to have a God like you. You think about us. You look after us. You love us. No matter how the devil can hate us, but Father God, we are so happy because you love us. You are preparing us for the rapture now. Is our time to go home now because Our luggage are ready. We are ready to go. Anytime the rapture can come, the pastor has said this many times. We are going home. He has preached everything. No one can preach to this bride again unless your angel can come like today and preach to us. Only the special ministry because is the time to going home. Bless our elder. Bless our pastor that divine healing because always when he choose somebody to come this pullpit we become blessed to connect us with your angel once again. Thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. You may take your seat. Thank you. May the Lord richly bless you. Can you turn to your neighbor and just say God bless you. Amen. Amen. My brother, there's a song I believe you always sing it. Lord, whatever you do, don't do it without me. Is that your soul? Amen. Can we clap hands for the Lord? as we invite our brother just to sing that song. Then after our worship team, we'll sing another song and we will be dismissed. God bless you.
