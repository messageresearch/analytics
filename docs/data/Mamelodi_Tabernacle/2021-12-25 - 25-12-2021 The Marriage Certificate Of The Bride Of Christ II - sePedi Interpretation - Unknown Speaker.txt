the ancients of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like a pure wool his throne was like thousand thousand ministers unto him and ten thousand times times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were okay no not uh [Music] um [Music] okay all right amen now let's take it from revelation chapter 5. now let me ahead of the scripture [Music] you realize that in the where we are going to read shall be judged the lake of fire but those in whose names are found in the book of life will be judged [Music] those in the book of life before i read it as i said to a brother we thank god to be in the book of life no brother we are in them but we are going to charge [Music] is not going through the judgment five fifteen has done being judged and founded uh guiltless amen [Music] now here let's read here cod page 607 607 oh god bless you sir yeah i'm here with you just now uh [Music] in the last day those are the people where he separated the sheep from the goats what it says matthew 25 verse 31 to 34 earrings when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him nation then shall he sit upon the throne of his clothes and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as the shepherd divided his ship from the boat yes and then and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world amen and to those on the left four i was enhanced and he gave me meat i was thirsty and he gave me drink i was a stranger and he chose me to those on the left hand side verse 36 41 verse 41 then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me he cast into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels right amen let's talk business he is separated on the now he's not talking about the are not going to be

pass judgment upon the people who did not receive the holy spirit [Music] does not paul say that he does he does only of any of us to take a matter to the court paul said to us not to take our matters [Music] sit with christ and judge christ kings and priests and judge these people that were preached to rasulullah about the baptism of the holy spirit so the bride will judge the people she has preached so as a child of god you know you are going to judge not to be judged of christ [Music] the bride has gone through the judgment and she's not going to judge to be judged but she's going to stand as queen and [Music] you are going to be judged by the person who preached to you the very same bread of christ will that preach to you [Music] you are going to to be judged by the person amen
