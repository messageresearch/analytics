[11:21] we will be looking
[11:24] idea melchized
[11:27] priesthood
[11:30] all right and we've seen yesterday
[11:37] how when he met
[11:40] Abraham
[11:44] he was melchized
[11:50] he came from heaven
[11:53] and met Abraham
[11:56] and he came as a high priest
[12:02] now furthermore Hebrews chapter seven
[12:07] weeks of the priesthood
[12:10] [Applause]
[12:11] after the order of melchized
[12:17] and you know the also the Bible
[12:31] [Applause]
[12:46] heavenly father again we come to thee
[12:50] knowing that Lord God away
[12:53] we have come here with nothing in our
[12:56] hands
[12:57] but the father we hear knowing that we
[13:00] will leave this place filled with the
[13:03] power of God and
[13:05] the word that created us
[13:08] in the beginning father we are so glad
[13:11] we are so glad that we are not even
[13:14] a creation but we were there before
[13:18] there was any creation
[13:21] and father we know the part that was
[13:23] created and the part that was in Christ
[13:27] and was not created father we are so
[13:31] thankful that we open our hearts now for
[13:34] the word to come again and then we know
[13:38] the real real preacher is the Lord Jesus
[13:42] Christ
[13:43] and we are living in the days where the
[13:46] angel of the Lord they stood up and said
[13:49] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[13:53] and that's why we are here Lord God
[13:56] bless our brothers bless the sisters
[14:00] heal the sick Lord as it's your duty you
[14:04] promised us that you will heal us you
[14:08] will speak to us and this morning we are
[14:11] so thankful that we are not alone in
[14:13] this place but you are with us here
[14:16] father as I pray for the opening of the
[14:20] word this morning and inviting you
[14:23] father as our preacher this morning in
[14:27] Jesus Christ's name I believe we will
[14:29] leave this place a blessed people
[14:32] singing songs of Zion in Jesus Christ
[14:35] name amen amen
[14:38] Hebrews chapter 7 from verse 11 to 26
[14:43] if therefore Perfection whereby the
[14:46] levitical priesthood for under it the
[14:49] people received the law what further
[14:52] need was there that another priest
[14:54] should rise after the order of
[14:56] Melchizedek and not be called after the
[14:59] order of Aaron
[15:01] for the priesthood being changed there
[15:04] is made of necessity a change also of
[15:06] the law
[15:08] for he of whom these things are spoken
[15:11] pertaineth to another tribe of which no
[15:15] man gave attendance at the altar for it
[15:19] is evident that our Lord sprung out of
[15:21] Judah of which tribe Moses spake nothing
[15:25] concerning priesthood
[15:27] and it is yet far more evident for that
[15:31] after the similitude of Melchizedek
[15:33] there arrives at another priest who is
[15:36] made not after the law of a carnal
[15:39] commandment but after the power of an
[15:43] endless life
[15:44] for he testified thou are a priest
[15:47] Forever After the order of melchized
[15:52] for there is verily a disanaling of The
[15:55] Commandments going before for the
[15:58] weakness and unprofitableness thereof
[16:02] for the law made nothing perfect but the
[16:06] bringing in of a better hope did by the
[16:10] which we draw nigh unto God and in as
[16:14] much as not without an oath he was made
[16:17] priest for those priests were made
[16:20] without an oath but this with an oath by
[16:24] him that said unto him the Lord swear
[16:28] and will not repent and thou art a
[16:31] priest Forever After the order of
[16:33] Melchizedek by so much was Jesus made a
[16:37] shorty of a better Testament
[16:41] and they truly were many pleased because
[16:44] they were not suffered to continue by
[16:47] reason of death
[16:48] but this man because he continues ever
[16:52] have an unchangeable priesthood
[16:55] wherefore he is able also to save them
[16:59] to the uttermost that come unto God by
[17:02] him seeing he ever liveth to make
[17:05] intercession for them
[17:07] for such an high priest became us who is
[17:11] Holy harmless undefiled separate from
[17:15] Sinners and made higher than the heavens
[17:18] amen
[17:20] you may be seated God bless him together
[17:32] pardon me brother
[17:35] pardon me
[17:48] okay God bless you brothers and sisters
[17:52] and everybody
[17:55] [Music]
[17:56] amen I believe we all know who is
[18:03] amen amen who met Abraham
[18:10] the king of
[18:13] and
[18:18] he is our King
[18:21] we know and this morning
[18:25] we want to thank him for being with us
[18:28] here
[18:36] sorry we exchanging things and things
[18:39] okay
[18:42] it's fine it's fine
[18:44] all right
[18:47] now we want to look
[18:49] and
[18:52] because you know brother Branham says
[18:56] were open how much you enough
[19:00] and he says then he is a king
[19:07] you know he met Abraham
[19:10] and later he met Brothers
[19:17] and
[19:20] he as you know I started last week or
[19:25] their third week
[19:33] there was this him
[19:39] I mean Abraham
[19:41] Abraham then he again said that we have
[19:46] another hymn because
[19:50] amen and I was looking into those things
[19:57] now we've brought up
[20:00] you know we he has also met Melchizedek
[20:06] melchized
[20:09] [Music]
[20:10] but when he met a citizen
[20:14] then he was called Melchizedek whatever
[20:18] because
[20:21] the king of Salem
[20:25] but he is
[20:30] we no longer hear about milk
[20:34] because he became Jesus so
[20:40] [Music]
[20:41] [Applause]
[20:54] [Music]
[20:57] but when he meets Abraham
[21:10] is a citizen
[21:12] now the king needs a citizen
[21:18] all right now what about these last days
[21:24] as you see we said yesterday

[21:48] the bread of Christ
[21:51] addressed by Melchizedek
[21:53] um
[21:54] [Applause]
[21:58] you know that's where we are going again
[22:01] and next time we'll come
[22:18] there are those who will come out
[22:21] afterwards
[22:26] they come through the tribulation period
[22:29] but greater

[23:27] for such a high priest
[23:32] became a
[23:34] swaba City
[23:36] amen amen
[23:39] maybe we are not thankful I don't know
[23:43] but if the word tells me that
[23:47] such a high priest
[23:51] when he met Abraham I met Abraham as the
[23:56] high priest
[24:02] he is and
[24:06] [Applause]

[24:56] [Applause]
[25:16] but
[25:39] [Music]

[25:47] because that is her time
[25:51] and the prophet says
[25:54] she will have the trust and the Lord
[25:59] and he says even Death Shall never touch
[26:03] it
[26:06] because she's on the runway
[26:10] waiting for them to be taken up

[26:19] look into this and
[26:22] [Applause]
[26:29] you know
[26:31] this high priest became US city
[26:37] all right amen then I'm I mentioned it
[26:41] again
[26:43] that in Genesis weaknesses God said
[26:52] let
[27:07] foreign
[27:11] this priest
[27:14] this high priest
[27:16] I don't know if you are listening
[27:19] he became
[27:22] a city
[27:25] amen is that so
[27:28] [Applause]
[27:30] you know even the Bible says Paul said
[27:34] we are talking these things today
[27:37] perfectly
[27:43] foreign
[27:54] [Music]
[27:56] [Applause]
[28:06] says we are perfect that means we have
[28:10] eternal life
[28:12] because there's only one Perfection
[28:14] that's God
[28:18] all right amen now the Bible tells us
[28:21] that we were chosen
[28:25] him oh yeah let us now start from the
[28:29] inside
[28:31] before we were chosen
[28:33] in him where do you find that scripture
[28:38] before palmy the foundation of the world
[28:44] [Applause]
[28:50] for God to choose me
[28:53] but I worship this God who has chosen me
[28:59] in him
[29:02] all right amen Amen brother
[29:06] let's find it there while I'm reading
[29:09] something here
[29:11] is that efficiency
[29:13] Ephesians chapter 1 from verse 4 yeah
[29:16] just just take that scripture it says
[29:19] according as he has chosen Us in him
[29:22] before the foundation of the world
[29:25] [Applause]
[29:27] before this
[29:29] because before before the foundation of
[29:32] the world
[29:35] we were already
[29:43] that's why in London
[29:46] I I I I don't believe that
[29:50] Satan can overcome a person who has
[29:53] chosen before he existed
[29:57] um
[30:00] let me repeat
[30:02] again
[30:03] I don't believe that
[30:06] Satan who Satan can overcome
[30:10] a person who was chosen
[30:14] before he Satan existed
[30:18] [Applause]
[30:20] amen amen I believe that the winner is
[30:23] the one who has chosen
[30:27] before the foundation of the world
[30:31] [Applause]
[30:43] now and
[30:45] foreign
[30:52] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[30:55] of the world
[30:57] okay are you listen closely
[31:01] chosen up in
[31:05] yesterday
[31:07] it doesn't choose it it doesn't say
[31:10] chosen up by him it is
[31:21] and we became him
[31:26] all right amen because already
[31:29] you go back you'll find yourself in him
[31:35] before he created anything we were in
[31:39] him
[31:41] watching
[31:44] and that's why now you know
[31:47] when he was talking
[31:49] to those he has known
[31:53] that is first John
[31:56] what does what it says first John
[32:00] chapter one that which was from the
[32:03] beginning which we have had which we
[32:06] have seen with our eyes right
[32:08] now that which was from the beginning
[32:15] now God has got no beginning
[32:19] and we were trying to do to say this yes
[32:23] in the beginning was the word
[32:27] and God has no beginning
[32:31] that's why it continues to say and they
[32:36] read was with God
[32:39] amen amen
[32:43] was God
[32:46] who
[33:05] okay now like you are coming through the
[33:09] stages
[33:13] foreign
[33:21] man has lost
[33:23] a sight of his image
[33:28] there is that saying
[33:31] the sight of His Image
[33:35] because we were made
[33:39] in his
[33:40] he has chosen us
[33:46] according as he has chosen Us in him
[33:49] before the foundation of the world that
[33:52] we should be holy and Without Blame
[33:55] before him in love
[33:59] driving
[34:01] all day just before
[34:04] the foundation
[34:07] before he started any other thing
[34:14] I will say I you also say I I was
[34:18] already chosen dance
[34:21] before there was Satan before they was
[34:24] sin I was chosen
[34:28] before there was divisions I was chosen
[34:33] before they was falling away
[34:38] amen amen so it is impossible for you
[34:43] to fall off
[34:46] because you were chosen look at you
[34:50] before palmy before they were even
[34:53] divisions or a church politics or church
[34:57] divisions you were already
[35:04] and
[35:13] the Bible says teacher by building
[35:21] ties in
[35:25] Abraham
[35:29] so they paid tithesis
[35:36] okay amen
[35:39] um
[35:41] I

[35:52] this Hebrew Book
[35:55] what would a man
[35:58] uh take Tides foreign
[36:10] [Music]
[36:19] [Applause]
[36:23] in Abraham
[36:25] [Music]
[36:29] when he was in the ruins of Abraham
[36:36] four generations before he ever come to
[36:40] Earth
[36:43] he was paying tithesis
[36:46] I want us to go inside
[36:50] a person who is paying times
[36:53] it is because he paid the tires
[36:57] [Applause]
[37:10] [Applause]
[37:29] [Music]
[37:31] you that can't believe
[37:52] is true
[37:56] um it brings you to where brother
[37:59] Branham puts it this way when
[38:03] Abraham met
[38:06] Melchizedek
[38:10] he paid tithesis
[38:15] to Melchizedek
[38:17] um
[38:21] [Applause]
[38:41] [Applause]
[38:48] [Applause]
[38:54] [Music]
[38:57] [Applause]
[39:19] [Applause]
[39:21] foreign foreign
[39:28] [Applause]
[39:33] we are not just talking about gifts and
[39:36] so forth against people talking about
[39:39] his himself
[39:43] you know what we need today
[39:45] not much of gifts and so forth what we
[39:50] need is himself
[39:52] that's why he also what he needs with us
[39:56] that's why he said let us
[40:00] make men in our image
[40:06] all right
[40:09] in order for him to keep us
[40:14] he made us in himself
[40:19] because if God can keep himself
[40:25] if God is Holy We Are Holy

[44:15] make men in our
[44:21] way too
[44:22] all right I mean
[44:25] is there such a man in the image of God
[44:31] all right let us make men my friends now
[44:36] let's go let's get out of the World
[44:38] Systems
[44:41] you find living churches are fighting
[44:44] one another in all directions
[44:47] not in Christ
[44:50] [Applause]
[44:57] is not in the world
[45:00] now in Christ we don't have divisions
[45:04] you can division you can have divisions
[45:07] in the world
[45:09] we don't have divisions in Christ
[45:13] amen amen Christ is not divided
[45:17] the bread of Christ is not divided
[45:23] I met a sister here
[45:27] I was at my in-laws one time
[45:31] now she said to me coming from a certain
[45:36] denomination
[45:37] she said to me
[45:40] you too the so-called message Believers
[45:44] so
[45:46] you are separated amen
[45:51] I said let me I beg your pardon he said
[45:56] you too
[45:57] you are separated
[46:00] I know of one group
[46:03] they don't go hand in hand with another
[46:07] group there
[46:09] I said we are talking about churches but
[46:13] I'm talking to you about the bride of
[46:15] Christ
[46:18] the brother of Christ is not in tatters
[46:24] we have only one Christ
[46:29] um
[46:31] so I said that now she tells me that I
[46:37] used to go around with a certain Pastor
[46:40] I love the Lord and revivals
[46:44] but when this and this and this happened
[46:48] then I lost hope
[46:51] even since that time I've never set my
[46:55] food in a church
[46:57] I said okay you are telling me you used
[47:01] to work with us also go around with us
[47:03] also
[47:04] now I'm telling you about Christ
[47:09] that's the difference
[47:11] I mean have you ever walked with Christ
[47:14] now you must start to work with Christ
[47:17] now
[47:18] you'll find that
[47:22] that you have experience
[47:27] you must work with
[47:30] Christ freeze through talk with him walk
[47:35] with him and you'll see the difference
[47:39] ah man
[47:48] [Applause]
[48:00] [Applause]
[48:02] [Music]
[48:06] [Applause]
[48:09] [Music]
[48:11] um
[48:12] from let us make men in our image
[48:17] I'm trying to uh say look at something
[48:22] here
[48:24] this message is true
[48:30] let's start from here
[48:33] and then
[48:35] chapter
[48:38] 15 15.
[48:42] now I start here now
[48:45] my Prophet tells me that
[48:49] God
[48:52] gave himself
[48:57] to this song again
[49:03] okay
[49:04] no
[49:06] let us try to look
[49:08] so much longer inside
[49:13] now we we took because it says eating it
[49:17] was the father
[49:20] and out of their father came forth the
[49:23] logos
[49:25] out of the logos
[49:29] you know starting from the inside
[49:35] out of the father came forth the logos
[49:39] out of the logos came forth the men now
[49:44] now the logos men
[49:47] the
[49:49] one who was in the
[50:07] if you say
[50:18] [Applause]
[50:30] that's why the Bible says he that is
[50:33] born of God
[50:37] [Applause]
[50:45] he gave birth
[50:48] now that which is born of God cannot sin
[50:52] because it is like God
[50:56] if all of us were born of God
[50:59] we would have peace love long suffering
[51:03] Temperance
[51:04] because being born of God you take the
[51:07] nature of God
[51:11] a child that is born of God has taken
[51:15] the nature of God
[51:17] it's not right
[51:21] we're born of God we will be in harmony
[51:26] we would love one another they would
[51:29] know they would never come divisions
[51:33] we will be like God we will be like our
[51:38] father
[51:39] amen amen that's why Redemption has to
[51:44] it took blood
[51:47] the blood of God
[51:51] the blood of the family man
[51:55] you know that's why called the King's
[51:58] Men redeemers
[51:59] [Applause]
[52:03] what the word King stands foreign
[52:09] amen amen
[52:11] King's Men Redeemer
[52:14] um
[52:19] but a family man
[52:22] the family man
[52:25] all right
[52:27] before I continue
[52:29] if we were if we are born of God
[52:34] we would never fight one another
[52:39] we would never hate one another
[52:43] would never say bad things about one
[52:46] another status
[52:52] makes us to be like God
[52:56] we come with the nature of God
[53:01] okay let us make men
[53:05] in our God was so careful let us make
[53:09] men
[53:10] in our
[53:12] foreign
[53:15] [Applause]
[53:29] which was before there was even an atom
[53:33] atom
[53:35] he gave
[53:37] himself
[53:42] okay I mean hey I don't know how to put
[53:45] it against but I think you understand
[53:48] what I'm saying is
[53:53] okay
[53:54] became
[54:01] a city now the last thing I'm going to
[54:05] read is
[54:08] let us make men
[54:11] in our
[54:14] welcome foreign
[54:18] [Applause]
[54:28] [Music]
[54:47] to restore
[54:50] foreign
[55:13] [Applause]
[55:43] all right
[55:45] four
[55:47] this high priest
[55:51] became us
[55:55] I don't know I'll be leaving this place
[55:58] going home that say still saying this
[56:01] high priest City
[56:04] [Applause]
[56:06] he became me
[56:08] that's why my the the the the the nature
[56:14] the divine nature that we have it's nice
[56:19] to be like him
[56:22] that is the divine nature
[56:26] of course we know as a human being
[56:30] you cannot beat your nature
[56:35] but as a child of God to have a divine
[56:39] nature
[56:40] which is of god
[56:44] you don't love somebody because he has
[56:46] given you some money
[56:49] I love him because you are loved
[56:54] if you read in the Bible God didn't say
[56:59] I have a way he said I am the way
[57:06] he never said I have the truth
[57:09] I am there the truth
[57:15] now just like you don't just say I'm a
[57:20] Christian
[57:21] you should be
[57:24] crushed like
[57:25] to be a Christian Christian
[57:31] but now that's why you know the bride of
[57:35] Christ
[57:36] is his wife
[57:42] if even an ordinary man
[57:46] of course if he is a Christian Christian
[57:49] we would love to marry a Christian
[57:53] wife
[57:58] I mean if he is a Christian
[58:02] he would not go against his own divine
[58:06] nature
[58:08] because his divine nature to serve God
[58:12] all right
[58:13] [Music]
[58:15] who's out for a wife
[58:18] it will be a Divine wife amen
[58:22] [Music]
