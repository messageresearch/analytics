[2:14:09] six people the agents of the devil
[2:14:23] satan who we do not fear satan or some
[2:14:26] children
[2:14:30] because he has fallen from heaven
[2:14:36] after he started an opposition party

[2:15:08] in heaven
[2:15:10] [Music]
[2:15:15] to human mind

[2:15:20] it's been raging on like that usually
[2:15:25] end up in the form of the garden of eden
[2:15:33] yes
[2:15:34] now every time you see some conflicts
[2:15:39] [Music]
[2:15:43] don't you fear or don't you worry
[2:15:46] our way foreign
[2:16:07] [Music]
[2:16:16] yeah this morning i just want
[2:16:19] us to look at this because it's the time
[2:16:22] for
[2:16:24] our return

[2:17:17] where to i sent it
[2:17:19] all right
[2:17:21] this word shall return
[2:17:26] now i am looking at the returning word
[2:17:30] of god
[2:17:35] which word was he talking about
[2:17:38] in july
[2:17:41] the way that will return back to him
[2:17:44] again
[2:17:48] because this word was in him
[2:17:53] and he decided to speak
[2:18:20] you are
[2:18:21] god's word in a physical
[2:18:24] form
[2:18:29] the child of god is there is that word
[2:18:32] that was sent
[2:18:35] killing julia
[2:18:36] rometro
[2:18:47] to start talking working preaching and
[2:18:50] singing
[2:19:16] that is the word of god
[2:19:32] i giving the revelations to that word i
[2:19:36] in
[2:19:38] love
[2:19:39] the word when it comes to this
[2:19:42] original man in a man
[2:19:45] in a human
[2:19:47] body
[2:19:54] we call it
[2:19:56] a revelation
[2:20:15] live
[2:20:18] because it's not a way that can be
[2:20:20] uttered by human beings
[2:20:27] it is the word of god killing julia
[2:20:29] mudimu send it to the word of god
[2:20:36] when the word of god
[2:20:39] meets with the word he has sent le
[2:20:42] corpora
[2:20:56] but what
[2:21:09] oh
[2:21:16] okay amen
[2:21:18] so
[2:21:19] we
[2:21:20] we are going to
[2:21:22] take this
[2:21:23] form from here
[2:21:39] now i repeat can we say later eden
[2:21:44] was the headquarters of god eden
[2:21:48] headquarters
[2:21:49] the garden of eden
[2:21:52] gardenia
[2:22:01] okay
[2:22:02] it is here you you find it here in the
[2:22:05] book of genesis if i like
[2:22:10] [Music]
[2:22:20] yeah i've got an old bible here just
[2:22:22] read it my brother and what happened
[2:22:24] genesis chapter 2 and the lord god
[2:22:27] planted a garden eastward in eden okay
[2:22:31] verse 7
[2:22:33] and the lord god formed men of the dust
[2:22:35] of the ground and breathed into his
[2:22:38] nostrils the breath of life and man
[2:22:40] became a living soul amen
[2:22:43] because this man
[2:22:46] the bible says there was no man to till
[2:22:48] the ground
[2:22:52] [Music]
[2:23:03] so god took that adam
[2:23:07] to put
[2:23:08] and put him into
[2:23:11] a body made of the dust
[2:23:16] color
[2:23:19] so that for the man to be able
[2:23:22] to remote
[2:23:25] the ground
[2:23:28] he put him in a
[2:23:30] body of
[2:23:31] made of the ground
[2:23:37] adam was not this body
[2:23:39] adama
[2:23:41] adam was put into
[2:23:43] that body
[2:23:53] [Music]
[2:23:59] one me
[2:24:00] and verse eight
[2:24:03] and the god and god planted a garden
[2:24:07] well marina
[2:24:09] is the watching eden
[2:24:11] eden took out
[2:24:18] amen amen because eden
[2:24:22] is a country as i'm told here
[2:24:25] gauri
[2:24:41] i don't believe there's a garden that
[2:24:42] that can much match that garden
[2:24:51] don't worry we are going back
[2:25:08] if there is something that we have
[2:25:10] missed back there if you analysis
[2:25:20] don't worry
[2:25:22] we are still going
[2:25:46] we have bypassed our theophanies
[2:26:04] adam
[2:26:12] but
[2:26:14] we were born through the permissive will
[2:26:16] of god after sin has entered
[2:26:31] originally we were not born
[2:27:14] not like it was
[2:27:16] nothing
[2:27:18] you see that facing canceling your way
[2:27:20] look out
[2:27:21] [Music]
[2:27:24] again
[2:27:28] because
[2:27:44] let me go back there again i was trying
[2:27:46] to bring you to something
[2:27:51] when i was told that a child is being
[2:27:53] [Music]
[2:27:55] attacked
[2:28:24] then i asked one
[2:28:26] she's the queen
[2:28:31] yeah
[2:28:32] we have met them you know the queens
[2:28:38] queen of indian ocean
[2:28:52] i expected this queen to be at that
[2:28:56] service
[2:29:01] but when i realized she's not there
[2:29:03] regular moreover
[2:29:06] i asked her where are you
[2:29:09] i said
[2:29:10] not my weight but she said
[2:29:14] i am under arch
[2:29:21] i said with whom
[2:29:24] she said with my daughter
[2:29:28] and i knew
[2:29:29] that they were there godzilla
[2:29:32] to help those who were at the service at
[2:29:37] tuition
[2:29:40] the place
[2:29:41] kempton park
[2:29:42] park
[2:29:45] but then we we prayed to break the link
[2:29:52] [Music]
[2:30:00] [Music]
[2:30:03] amen amen
[2:30:05] and if you are talking about the son of
[2:30:07] god
[2:30:10] you are not just talking about a mere
[2:30:12] man
[2:30:14] an ordinary person munnar
[2:30:31] there's some people working in this
[2:30:32] world
[2:30:35] without any people
[2:30:38] but a son of god but a doctor of god
[2:30:41] is a person with a people
[2:30:44] unalienable
[2:31:11] and the lord god planted a garden east
[2:31:14] what in eden
[2:31:20] that's why the gate is called the east
[2:31:26] east gate
[2:31:42] i was reading many things about the
[2:31:46] man
[2:31:46] who has lost
[2:31:48] his
[2:31:50] sight
[2:32:33] because god made you
[2:32:36] cowardice
[2:32:48] you know what is healing after all
[2:32:51] usually
[2:32:54] amen amen can you answer me
[2:32:59] healing is to restore something
[2:33:18] the word lin
[2:33:22] for restoration
[2:33:26] that is in you
[2:33:28] didn't you know when
[2:33:33] all right let me put it this way
[2:33:39] my hand
[2:33:42] can't work
[2:33:45] it's like a dead
[2:34:01] oh it is working
[2:34:05] coming
[2:34:06] it happened several times not once he
[2:34:09] directly runs yesterday because what i
[2:34:12] believe is
[2:34:22] [Music]
[2:35:22] because you believe our domain
[2:35:38] that has the power killing troops
[2:35:41] not oil not water
[2:35:44] only
[2:35:45] me are you there
[2:35:47] hallelujah
[2:35:49] now i want you to understand something
[2:36:20] now i'm ready you like
[2:36:22] that that's how originally it was
[2:36:26] not like it is now
[2:36:29] wrong
[2:36:32] even people could
[2:36:36] could be healed by the shadow of peter
[2:36:43] actually they are healed by god
[2:36:47] for this i came but because somebody
[2:36:49] believed that this man peter is a
[2:36:52] servant of god
[2:37:10] and some of them took the towels off
[2:37:12] paul van gaal
[2:37:15] because preaching
[2:37:19] wipe himself like that
[2:37:22] there was a tower
[2:37:24] i shared it with you got healed but he
[2:37:27] don't know who made my phone
[2:37:29] i mean
[2:37:30] that healing is something of that nature
[2:37:38] now
[2:37:39] you look at this
[2:37:41] i'm going to talk for
[2:37:44] a few minutes the god will allow me to
[2:37:46] do semiconductors the people that are
[2:37:48] going back
[2:37:49] to abuela
[2:37:52] healing is also that thing usually
[2:37:55] eternally attending
[2:37:57] to your health
[2:37:59] well
[2:38:00] more
[2:38:02] healthy all these things
[2:38:04] check out the healing
[2:38:06] position
[2:38:07] [Music]
[2:38:10] we are talking about it going back
[2:38:54] because in the beginning
[2:38:56] [Music]
[2:39:03] [Applause]
[2:39:06] even to be taken in the rapture it takes
[2:39:08] the
[2:39:09] [Music]
[2:39:19] that will cause you in the twinkling of
[2:39:21] an eye to take off
[2:39:35] is
[2:39:46] [Music]
[2:39:49] some of these things last time
[2:39:54] i think i don't know
[2:39:57] but
[2:39:58] everything now usually come on
[2:40:02] restoration
[2:40:19] is
[2:40:45] almost in every country
[2:40:48] [Music]
[2:41:00] every human being is my brother
[2:41:02] is my sister
[2:41:07] amen
[2:41:08] so god hasn't given me that the spirit
[2:41:10] of xenophobia
[2:41:14] he has given
[2:41:24] when we
[2:41:26] reach
[2:41:28] when we reach the beyond
[2:41:32] there
[2:41:33] will there be any uh
[2:41:35] that phobia in
[2:41:37] the new jerusalem
[2:41:39] israel
[2:42:10] we are one because the blood is of
[2:42:14] christ
[2:42:20] it's not even human blood assembly
[2:42:22] amount
[2:42:24] the blood of christ
[2:42:29] to be
[2:42:30] another type of blood they they don't
[2:42:33] know the blood of christ
[2:42:40] sure right now let me finish this
[2:42:43] and the lord god planted a garden
[2:42:45] eastward in eden and there he put the
[2:42:48] men whom he had formed
[2:42:52] morena
[2:43:03] he gave him a form
[2:43:06] of
[2:43:08] all right
[2:43:10] if i can take that form of you
[2:43:15] then you remain a theophany
[2:43:21] mainly one over them you know the bible
[2:43:23] says god is there
[2:43:31] can you see a spirit
[2:43:52] because it started as the mind of god
[2:43:57] all right
[2:43:59] and
[2:44:00] the mind of god
[2:44:17] among us
[2:44:19] and we saw his glory
[2:44:22] amen amen how god changed into this form
[2:44:26] this form this form like that
[2:44:45] and
[2:44:46] out of the grow the ground
[2:44:50] god
[2:44:51] all right let me read it let me read out
[2:44:53] of the ground
[2:44:55] made the lord god to grow every tree
[2:44:58] that is
[2:45:00] pleasant to the site and good for food
[2:45:05] and the tree of life also
[2:45:07] in the midst
[2:45:09] of the garden and the tree of knowledge
[2:45:13] of good
[2:45:14] and evil
[2:45:39] and did you know that
[2:45:43] the people
[2:45:45] now living
[2:45:47] know that
[2:45:48] those two trees were
[2:45:50] humans
[2:46:04] so
[2:46:05] god comes in parables and sometimes you
[2:46:08] know
[2:46:19] he's singing
[2:46:24] you are not a snake but the serpent
[2:46:26] separated me
[2:46:28] amen
[2:46:35] it is not a snake
[2:46:38] i still know if was not deceived by a
[2:46:41] snake ever as a foreigner
[2:46:51] can you can you believe
[2:46:53] a doctrine that says it was
[2:46:58] deceived by a snake
[2:47:02] in november
[2:47:16] a girl is deceived by a boy
[2:47:33] it's a harley it's a
[2:47:39] all right
[2:47:41] now when things were were like
[2:47:45] this like men in the
[2:47:58] he allowed the serpent to come and
[2:48:01] interpret that to him
[2:48:07] the man
[2:48:08] the man allowed the subject the woman
[2:48:12] there if
[2:48:14] allowed the serpent to come
[2:48:17] out
[2:48:22] and deceived him
[2:48:26] because
[2:48:27] the serpent came in interpreted to head
[2:48:30] a tree of knowledge
[2:48:41] don't eat from this because
[2:48:45] the day you eat
[2:48:47] you'll be like
[2:48:50] okay
[2:49:10] they ate from the forbidden
[2:49:13] fruit
[2:49:23] of the
[2:49:25] of the garden
[2:49:29] [Music]
[2:49:33] they went out through the east gate
[2:49:38] yeah
[2:49:40] have you seen it in your bible
[2:49:42] [Music]
[2:49:44] yes because i i'm trying to finish up

[2:52:05] [Music]
[2:52:12] you know they start to change perfect or
[2:52:15] amen i mean they no longer need prayers
[2:52:19] and so forth
[2:52:21] you get what i mean
[2:52:23] especially once they can touch that tree
[2:52:49] and
[2:52:50] grace came in the form of christ
[2:53:01] [Music]
[2:53:56] [Applause]
[2:54:19] verse 24
[2:54:20] right
[2:54:21] so he drove out the men and he placed at
[2:54:24] the east of the garden of eden cherubims
[2:54:28] and a flaming sword which turned
[2:54:30] everywhere to keep the way of the tree
[2:54:32] of life

[2:55:47] a substitute instead of adam
[2:55:52] cherubim
[2:55:55] amen amen
[2:56:25] the tree of life is
[2:56:32] god
[2:56:35] that was
[2:56:37] that what there was to god the
[2:56:42] the tree of life
[2:56:49] to guard the way of that tree of life
