[Music] where is brother Shadrach okay where are you brother is he in today [Music] okay [Music] I wanted to see brother Shadrach and his son Enoch [Music] okay I mean I will phone I will phone them after that all right God keep them where they are do you know brother and you know his son yeah amen I'll talk to them okay furthermore we are blessed we have our Noble Brothers [Music] in the service of the Lord amen amen we have been talking greeting them every Sunday we are together with them [Applause] [Music] there is another Elder here brotherly memes and it's a greeting from brother Larry Names Christ's abilities manifestation an atmosphere of love expressed in fellowships is the master of the Wings then he says Elohim [Applause] let us worship Eagles [Music] Florida Florida um [Applause] greetings so uh it's our Nobel and our Eternal brother okay brother memes as well we are together that's why now we are seeing the Regatta ring of them of the seeds amen amen we are on the journey we have started already potentially the Rapture is in you are just on the runway Runway so usually uh our Noble brother arrived on Thursday so we have been together and but I would love to have him and for some for some minutes I'll ask him to come just and say hello says amen okay welcome brother [Applause] [Music] just be free [Music] blessing to be here the wrong way oh there we go uh it's a blessing to be here 's the fusing is it is it Audible oh I need to hold that closer is that better yeah I'll try to remember that um just a couple things I wanted to say I try to keep it brief I really was hoping that they would let me sit down here with these other brothers Jesus said you're supposed to take the lowest seats but I just I when I saw brother and Kadima the other day I said you know is a real sword and I said I am a real person I have a question and um you know there's different little sayings that we have in our country and um you may have heard and some of them may just be American but they have one and it it is the proof of the pudding pudding that you would eat the proof of the pudding is in the tasting there the tasting thereof so if I have a bowl of chocolate pudding and ice this is chocolate pudding your chocolate some other man says no oh my God that's better Scotch pudding uh yeah see I see a chocolate chip say well it's brown it's it's a pleasantry he says no they put coloring in it so I say okay so we'll settle this now I have four spoons here you want to give one to Mr critic and I have two other people here you are in this argument at all okay now take your spoon and take a scoop yeah there you go I told you it's chocolate pudding in the mouth of two or three Witnesses sometimes you have to have an actual reality and uh so if you shake hands with an imaginary non-existing person but uh some people just maybe didn't believe that yeah I think really that that's a very bad thing to say how about your pastor really some others that have said I want to also make mention of brother Larry Mims the last time I saw him asked me to degree he would be here if if he could foreign [Music] so there's southeast state is the United States South Asia United States and if you go at that State North there's there's land that runs along the coastline and that's called the panhandle of Florida right I mean and so I live on that pan here in a city called Fort Walton Beach and I live in a little Township that is right along houses brother Larry Mims lives in Alabama just across the uh line the state line going down he lives in a town called Brewton Alabama I try to shake his imaginary hand about once a month if I can okay we get together and uh and so it's a real blessing brother Mims is what I would call an Elder's elder brother and the reason that I say that because brother men's has had years in the past before he heard the message that he did some Evangelistic work in South America he has been in many of the meetings of the charismatics so he brings with him a certain amount of experience I mean now when we were having lunch here a few months back I told brother Larry I said I said you know I've got it in my heart to go to Africa I said I really want to go there brother Larry looks at me he says you you better make sure it's a will of God for you to you he said you better make sure of that well brother now brother Larry yeah I didn't realize brother Larry has been in dangerous circumstances here in this congregation but I'm talking about just he has been out among people in South America so in brother Larry's thinking he knows that I'm in good company here but he knows that I'm in a country where maybe I might not be safe if it wasn't for that he said you can be sure they'll be keeping a close eye on you at all times everybody has just been just wonderful foreign [Music] some of the people I have met here from the other day God bless you [Applause] [Music] say [Applause] all right that's our we hope to see a brother Larry memes one day [Music] you know myself [Music] he came with his food his cell phone okay there was somebody calling and he said this is for you now when I listen yeah it was I think on Thursdays somebody I don't know whether she is here they want to kill you and you know our song you can say it let me you [Music] know amen yeah I mean you know this one is now there is immortality we know we are waiting for a change [Music] I'm very very soon we will preach amen amen God told us amen amen you fear something the Bible says fear and the Lord Jesus says fear not it's a boyfriend and the Bible says we are not of this world amen the water you know we have the Earth so the world is a system issue foreign [Music] It's a Wonderful testimony okay amen if somebody has gotten the numbers of brother Shadrach um yes oh God bless you son amen yes you'll write them down piece of paper here all right but God bless him where he is do you still remember this thing of the money rituals actually [Music] did you do you know that no later money rituals and the Satan can tell somebody that is should you bring me such as such a child or the blood of that child you'll get two billion two millions they call it money yeah the rituals you'll find it even in the churches okay but in Christ we don't have such things okay let us reach the word of God and just for this morning we believe God will bless us with this scripture amen amen and while standing our heavenly father we come to thee this morning Lord God [Music] we know Thou Art the one there's no one like thee we are so glad that before the foundation of the world we were in the rainbow system and today Father we are in that constellations their constellation of the seven colors which was their ending God came out of there changing and changing until today he came as a man amen the Lord Jesus Christ amen and the father we are so glad because we have known you because we were together before the foundation of the world and that's why in this morning we fear nothing because the Lord Jesus is in this house with us thank you Lord for being so good and thank you Father that this morning we are here to worship you without any fear of Satan Satan is a fallen form he has no power over us as the Lord said I give you power and we thank you that we are here to worship you in Christ Jesus name I pray let the sick be healed that I heal bless everybody here whether it's a visitor but bless every brother and sister bless the word we are about to partake of as I pray in Jesus Christ's name thank you Lord amen as we read and Genesis let's start from chapter 18. 17 to 22. amen amen Genesis 18 17-22 and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do see that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he have spoken of him and the Lord said because the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very Grievous I will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the Cry of Youth which is come unto me and if not I will know and the men tend their faces from things and went towards and Abraham stood yet before the Lord amen are you through okay then you may be seated you know [Music] I want take time because this morning I was just struggling with some other things because before I left my place for the service now we were going through yeah we saw the three and a half years of Christ's prophecies and now Jolly you know the prophet of God speaks now of the three and a half years of Lucifer Lucifer I mean the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ three and a half years of his prophecies then he says again then there is another three and a half years that is of Lucifer amen amen and then that three and a half years it's just about to start you know you know the Bible says Lord Lord looked at sodomless and he was pleased you know that scripture brother Genesis chapter 13. from verse 10. and Lord lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plane of Jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and come on even as the guardian of the Lord light the land of Egypt as Thou come as unto Thor amen he sucked but he was pleased to see Sodom and government it was well watered and then he was thinking of Agriculture and he loved it but the Bible says and even today really the world is destroyed the fastest amen amen so we we have arrived there are seals were opened so what else because this is the prophet of God says this is for the Bible says got up he got up and stood where it went to the place where he stood before the Lord [Music] you know that's why before we can continue we had to go back first to where we stood with the Lord amen amen because our ministry is timeless [Music] so you've got to go back in order to see for me to see in his condition I have to go back where I stood before the Lord amen because from there he could see amen right now we read it and when he looked he saw smoke it pleased Lord before it been feeling it was well watered amen amen just like today we hear predictions and predictions and yet I don't see that brightness I only see the coming of them and now I am going to share with you some few things the Lord willing all right amen and now we are blessed by the message if you reach let me read the in the Bible Genesis let me find this place it says first one and the Lord appeared unto him in the Flames of Mama and he said as in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he went to meet them from the 10 door and about himself towards the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in this site pass not away I pray thee from thy sovereign [Music] a king of Salem amen amen because all the I mean the Seed of Abraham even today operates under the king of Salem because they are the citizens and when God met Abraham he spoke to him and Abraham started and Abraham and his seat not not his children now let's look at this he invited the Lord and you know how even brother Brennan mentioned mentioned this that Abraham said to him my Lord foreign he only knew the Lord okay amen now then he invited them for was it lunch or sort of yeah prepared them food Abraham knew that Abraham it is God is now a man here is sometimes we you serve God in your house and you don't know come on yes it is [Music] then he continues they beg for him and then he said the verse 10. I will certainly return and today according to the time of life shall have a son because the Bible says verse 11. Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age [Music] it cease to be with Sarah after the manner of churches foreign and then because they were three but Abraham recognized that's why he said amen amen and this means rules hence and look towards [Music] then is then the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham as Abraham was not supposed to go with this man because he was with God spoke to Abraham about everything that would take place there and he said and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and then all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him not the children but they see the over Abraham the Bible says even the Lord Jesus Christ amen all right and then now jolly and I'm coming to this I came he says verse 20. the Lord said because the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great yeah sin is very Grievous what do you see today [Music] yeah watch that Revelation chapter 12. 7 verse 10 to 12. 12 chapter 12. okay and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation now I want where he says chapters chapter 12 verse 12 chapter 7 that's where he says then there was war in heaven chapter 12 chapter 12 verse 7 verse 7. carry on and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevent Lord neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I had a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Adam and by the word of their testimony and they laughed not their lives unto the death therefore Rejoice he heavens and he that dwell in them who to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great rest because he knoweth that he have but a short time amen amen now Joy can we rewind a bit it says it speaks of those that are already in heaven says all right amen and they're blessed are those those who were found to be in heaven at that time okay you know we went through these things remember verse 10 verse 10 repeat verse 10 brother here and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night are you aware that he was talking to the raptured things John leave my my the message today is the identified that pool yes [Music] now I will read this party will continue I will read this party souls in prison that that's why we went all the way back to the Book of Genesis foreign so the Lord was not part of the delegation that went to Lord all right amen now let us identify today it's now the end amen amen and been the end of time so it is now let us look at the third pool and it is identified this third pool [Music] amen amen I'm glad to that yeah the third pool is identified right amen and we have the book here Look Away to Jesus Look Away to Jesus and Peach I will start from page five five let's look at these things Look Away to Jesus Look Away to Jesus okay I mean God bless you now Look Away to Jesus Look Away to Jesus it starts by saying he spoke of his experience and then we spoke about Jehovah when Abraham needed God provided that realm and he provided the schools amen amen and then it says when I said that he won he was narrating to the people about that creation when I said that a humble little woman for the first time this ever happened upon a human being was a little humble woman yeah now while you had took thinking about it this is how it happened for the first time this happens yeah foreign [Music] it speaks of itself now it's not something that you can teach us he says I've tried to explain and I made mistakes this will be the thing to my opinion this will be the thing that will start the rapturing perfect [Applause] it's not a teaching you don't receive Rapture and Faith by teaching [Music] by a third pool that speaks for itself all right you know one day we spoke about something here that speaks for itself when Adam forfeited the book and the last in the last days the prophet then came and said standing in the game because Adam a God and men were one when Adam left his posts please something else there we assessing family because God will never failure it is the place of man in partnership with God as the prophet of God man is the other part of the contract with God did you know that now standing in the game let me try again standing in which game is we are coming here to this third pool standing in which again yes or standing in which game which game men left his posts now he left air well again [Music] could not replace Adam with something else that's why he came as the second adult and you know in that book perfect faith let me reach I don't know whether you are going to accept this I let me ask you a question again we went to where brother Brandon received a swathi foreign foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] is there to put men back again yeah back today because that that belonged to men yeah the seventh angel message was given a swan with children then he said standing now for him to stand on the game he has to receive a sword and then for men and God to come together again amen amen God being the god of the universe and a man being the god of the earth what restoration means what Redemption means is to put it back again amen all right now standing in the game he received a sword to stand in that game which the Lord Jesus sprinkled with his blood and cleanse it because the greater law is the restoration because God can't be defeated he must restore everything that Satan tried to misplace that's right amen even you as a child a daughter of God if you are a daughter of God then you are because to be a daughter is through the blood you know that blood that flow amen It Is by Through Blood all right now him the third pool is properly identified we know where it is then it says the third pool is here what happens it speaks of itself I I try to explain to the others and I make mistakes this will be the thing that to my opinion we accept will be a thing that will start the rupturing phase now so don't you see Roman denomination did denomination mark that will force all Protestants you have to be into this Council of churches or you won't be able to have a fellowship well it's tightening we were looking at the other days some of them were arrested we are drifting towards them but the bread of Christ amen amen God don't allow the Lord will not allow his wife to go through that she will be raptured before this thing comes upon the people and then it says it's tightening every day people are being arrested for preaching now the Press comes to a place to where you are pressed out then watch I'm fixing to tell you in few minutes [Music] foreign [Applause] foreign I was talking there's a mimic somewhere trying to do things right now as you see me because the church is the bride is targeted like I said someone yesterday and it's not for the first time at all I was told that they came in big numbers sometimes ago some they know about it amen amen and when one of their sisters ask foreign [Music] all right but I'm saying my the prophet said [Applause] that's why I don't fear I don't feel Satan Satan is a defeated foreign the very same Force the power that fought him and was cast down to the end he is still going to face that Force it doesn't change the Satan that is trying to attack us the battle of Armageddon it is a battle that was foreign he says it started Beyond time and it will end up [Applause] now that's why the people don't understand it because the very same people who defeated Satan they will continue to defeat amen amen he is not a new Satan is still that Satan who was defeated but those who defeated him will continue to defeat him yes do you know that and now he speaks of the third person before Sodom y before the smoke goes up [Music] amen amen but the problem then speaks of the third truth before I carry on watch Superman uh page 48 42.42 says you know or for Abraham Abraham Abraham calls him my Lord Abraham will Adam and now the tool went down to Sodom but Abraham remained with the Lord okay now here it says look at the world that's page 42 souls in prison that went last there was more more messy it was all over then he calls him the third messenger now when they come to Abraham they were three now this other one he says is the third pool the messenger that went down there foreign [Music] [Music] did you know that amen amen I stand aside because that's why and some of us went back to start afresh with the first seal seconds yeah under the Third pool that is the third messenger then where is it it says here what kind of a Ministry did he have now foreign right amen that Abraham Abraham remain with the third one did you know that the bride now has remained with the third one I mean and it was the third one who spoke to Abraham of the things to foreign and uh or listen to the message of the hour before Doom no one let us pass that one third pool after the third person the doors was shut [Music] I mean because he was preaching to the people would never repent [Applause] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] the devil points out to them even some children that if I can get the blood of that foreign [Music] we believe that God is with us [Applause] and we do not have children for sale [Applause] this people they are lost souls they do not know God there is who went also he was looking for some money yeah the love of money is now he came to Africa he was told that there's a magician in Africa what the Magic in Africa and uh if you can meet that one uh he will give you you'll get something and you'll make millions billion he came all the way from America America to see that man then after that he started to perform and was getting money but he has sold his soul yeah the soul is on sale today [Music] foreign you know the Bible says of this time that is coming return to Revelation chapter 10 to 12. 10 to 12 10 to 12. Revelation chapter 12 from verse 10. and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice in Heavens and he that dwell in them who to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great rest because he knoweth that he has but a short time who unto the inhabitants of the earth and the Sea lady walking because Satan is cast down you know when the bride goes up Satan comes down I mean I mean at first a billing he was kicked out of heaven to the Earth and he started to pollute the Earth until now but the time now is coming for him he will be arrested he's gonna be arrested yes and put in jail for a thousand years do you read your Bible challenge now his followers some of them are here please follow us are going to band with him [Music] because you're gonna reap what you said foreign they don't know what is going to happen to them do you know that day of the wrath of God [Music] you see landslides huh do you see what is happening and the prophet when he started to speak about love this instructions he spoke of these things was the place of landslides amen amen and it is happening now what is happening around the world and when I pray I always thank God and one ask me a question now because we have our brethren in California go California oh you know the prophet when he looked at America he's so smoke now I said car no it's not for the bride amen the bride will be gone as a before that smug God will take his wife amen and it is so close that's why now it says the one who bewitches him there's no more turning back that's true he does not know that there is hell I asked a sister she used to fly and all those things I said do you know of the coming days and she said no we were taught of that you uh professing Christianity efficient they also live on now hold some services to contradict the word under that contradiction they believe it to be a message as they told me [Music] every day every Sunday you come together you foreign the bride of Christ [Music] you come together every Sunday we meet yeah to oppose you know one day we fought off Satan right here why because he was trying to cause mischievous things here now you know do you know him no we knew him then I was called out again that something is happening only to find that he was stopping a certain sister to get in today then we fought with we fought he ran away yeah I'm not saying this for you to fear I'm saying we are more than conquerors [Music] sometimes when we come to the service we are told that this and this is going to happen we just pray to God and come knowing that the god whom we worship has overcome [Music] and he says there is some conquerors but it says [Applause] so that's why I'm trying to bring these things so that you'll understand sometimes when you see them calling us out you've been the bride of Christ the world hates you live because you are not of the world I mean even the Lord Jesus he said so because he was not afraid of the world is but I'm saying the doors [Music] what if God one day because he's going to close the door you know that he said last time behold I still at the door and knock yeah if any man hear my voice he didn't say here my gospel hear my aqua because voice is a spiritual song and open the door he's looking at the individuals foreign [Music] sister came with some problems after problems Israel at one time they were on this side in Egypt now God had to deliver them he didn't send some prophets with miracles to Egypt he commanded Moses to cross over who reacted to lead them across that's why this message the ministry of the seventh angel Messengers is for us to cross over then I said to the assistant you've got so many problems it is because we are on this side of the problems now you must cross over get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ only I don't know the sister now but she got baptized right that actually and she went and brought another one that's a sister uh I have found salvation I've been suffering on this side they were suffering on that side let them across ery to the others maybe you too you are traveling on this side we have been prayed for timing again but nothing is happening because you are still on the on that side now you can cross to
