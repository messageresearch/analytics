[13:45] um thank you for singing unto the
[13:50] Lord you know
[13:54] H I was talking with a
[13:57] brother and they all believe
[14:01] that
[14:03] Africans when
[14:06] singing they
[14:09] sing
[14:10] they or they serve
[14:14] god with
[14:17] their Inner
[14:19] Man and the outer
[14:23] man you'll never find them singing
[14:27] standing
[14:29] like
[14:30] that it looks like this music is even in
[14:34] their
[14:37] fingers and in their
[14:40] legs that's why every
[14:42] time they sing like that and if you are
[14:46] not really
[14:49] spiritual you can rebuke them but if you
[14:52] are
[14:55] spiritual

[15:39] worship God they worship God with
[15:43] [Music]
[15:47] all their fingers and
[15:51] their I said then it will be

[18:56] times okay amen
[18:59] now do you have the scripture with you
[19:02] there you can read that in
[19:07] English it's First Kings chapter 18 from
[19:10] verse 41-
[19:13] 46 and Elijah said unto Ahab get the up
[19:17] eat and drink for there is a sound of
[19:21] abundance of rain so Ahab went up to eat
[19:25] and to drink and Elijah went up to the
[19:28] top of cayl and he cast himself down
[19:32] upon the Earth and put his face between
[19:35] his knees and said to his servant go up
[19:39] now look toward the sea and he went up
[19:43] and looked and said there is nothing and
[19:46] he said go again seven times and it came
[19:50] to pass at the seventh time that he said
[19:54] behold there there ariseth a little
[19:56] Cloud out of the sea
[19:58] see like a man's hand and he said go up
[20:03] say unto Ahab prepare thy Chariot and
[20:06] get the down that the rain stop thee not
[20:10] and it came to pass in the meanwhile
[20:12] that the heaven was black with clouds
[20:15] and wind and there was a great rain and
[20:18] Ahab rode and went to jezrael and the
[20:22] Hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he
[20:25] GED up his loins and ran before Ahab to
[20:29] the entrance of
[20:31] jezriel
[20:33] Amen I think it will be a good thing to
[20:36] read also in
[20:38] the
[20:39] chapter all
[20:41] right from verse
[20:46] 41 first
[20:48] kter 18 verse
[20:57] 41

[22:14] bless you as you take your
[22:18] seats amen
[22:21] amen
[22:23] Okay go
[22:26] again
[22:29] go again seven
[22:32] times okay now we are looking at this
[22:37] subject
[22:39] here
[22:41] but H I will
[22:44] have
[22:47] also a
[22:50] text
[22:52] saying it's a
[22:55] season for change
[22:58] is a
[23:01] season for
[23:03] change all
[23:05] right H you know there's some
[23:10] brothers uh they blessed us there's
[23:16] there they blessed us with that
[23:19] song a
[23:21] season it's a season for
[23:25] change amen amen I think all of us
[23:31] here will
[23:34] agree that it's a
[23:37] season for
[23:40] Change
[23:41] and the reason he said go seven
[23:48] times
[23:50] then they H went seven
[23:55] times round about the also
[23:59] Jero but on the
[24:02] seventh he said go
[24:07] again seven
[24:09] times now that's why we have seven
[24:12] Church
[24:14] ages and we have
[24:19] seven okay let's let's talk this
[24:23] morning we have seven Church
[24:26] ages
[24:28] Seven
[24:30] Seals yes amen that me meaning that
[24:35] there is a second
[24:39] time for the bright as we will read out
[24:43] of this book
[24:46] here the first was the H seventh seven
[24:52] Church
[24:53] [Music]
[24:55] ages with a
[24:58] an the angel of the
[25:01] Lord
[25:03] or the
[25:07] minister for the seven Church
[25:11] ages but again we have another pyramid
[25:17] pyramid there's two
[25:20] pyramids
[25:22] us about the first
[25:25] pyramid and a minister
[25:29] the seventh angel
[25:32] messenger then again he speaks
[25:36] about another
[25:38] pyramid which is the Pyramid of
[25:42] angels amen amen down after this
[25:47] pyramid there is
[25:50] another pyramid pyramid and then now the
[25:54] first pyramid pyramid has
[25:59] ended there there this book
[26:03] here uh the it is
[26:07] called The
[26:10] Rapture uh I believe that the last thing
[26:13] we are looking
[26:15] for here is the
[26:18] rupture the bread of Christ is just
[26:22] waiting for
[26:25] rupture but how we come there's a way
[26:30] that God has
[26:31] made for us to arrive at the
[26:36] rupture that's why we also need to go
[26:41] again seven
[26:46] times we were reading last
[26:50] time about the pyramid the pyramid that
[26:54] this pyramid was the sign of Enoch
[27:00] now let's read say something about this
[27:03] Enoch
[27:04] here Enoch was the seventh man from
[27:11] Adam then we find this pyramid
[27:16] also brother
[27:18] also is the seventh
[27:22] messenger from
[27:25] Paul it ends up
[27:28] uh that way starts that way up that
[27:33] way so the bride has been shaped out out
[27:40] already of the first
[27:44] pyramid and now we see God introduced
[27:49] now another
[27:52] pyramid which is the Pyramid of
[27:56] angels and
[27:58] now as we are looking
[28:00] here page 20 of the book of The
[28:04] Rapture says now we find here
[28:08] that Enoch was the seventh from Noah
[28:13] from
[28:15] Adam which was a type of the church
[28:21] ages now all now all of the rest of the
[28:26] six men
[28:28] before him
[28:32] died amen you know here we talking about
[28:36] seven Church
[28:38] ages but we remain here as the
[28:43] seventh because all the
[28:46] others are in the six
[28:49] Dimension they
[28:51] died and so they waiting for
[28:54] us and but we taking it from
[28:58] here now Enoch was
[29:02] translated Enoch was raptured that is
[29:05] Page 20 of the book of book The
[29:11] rupture he was ruptured the seventh
[29:15] showing that is the seventh Church
[29:19] age that takes the
[29:23] rupture amen amen no I I believe
[29:29] that myself I know
[29:31] that I'm in the
[29:35] seventh I believe that you know yourself
[29:39] that you are in
[29:45] the or are you
[29:48] in another
[29:50] age no the seventh Church
[29:55] age all right amen
[29:58] now out of the churches and all
[30:01] religious movements that we have in this
[30:07] world God shaped out his
[30:12] bride Seven
[30:17] Ages the sign of
[30:20] Enoch now
[30:23] anything outside of that is not the
[30:26] bride of Christ
[30:28] the bright is shaped in
[30:33] sevenes called out of that
[30:36] age and out of that
[30:39] age together they make the
[30:43] bride amen amen and now I read this part
[30:48] here uh it types with
[30:52] Enoch the seventh showing that it's the
[30:56] seventh the church
[30:59] age that takes the
[31:03] rupture amen amen because others are
[31:08] asleep but the
[31:10] seven okay amen there's no doubt we are
[31:15] in the seventh Church
[31:17] age we all
[31:20] know now is the
[31:23] seventh is the seventh now you'll
[31:27] understand understand that no other
[31:30] person or
[31:32] person outside of
[31:34] this can be can be
[31:38] raptured the people that will be
[31:41] ruptured they are
[31:43] here the seventh Church
[31:47] age that's all outside of that you don't
[31:52] have another Rapture a Rapture a special
[31:55] Rapture for the other people
[31:59] okay and now that we are in the seventh
[32:03] Church there are things that will
[32:05] identify
[32:08] us to show that we are in the
[32:13] seventh the people that are in the
[32:16] seventh Church
[32:19] age if you look at them how they worship
[32:24] God it's not like any
[32:28] other
[32:30] people you know the children of God even
[32:34] when Jesus was on the
[32:36] earth there was
[32:38] difference between those who follow
[32:41] Jesus and other forms of
[32:46] worship amen amen because the seventh
[32:50] Church age find people that are so
[32:54] unique they are not like the other
[32:58] people a
[33:00] church with
[33:02] the
[33:05] anointing Anointed with the
[33:08] word because our
[33:12] time brother Bram
[33:15] says we are living in the time not of
[33:19] the Holy Ghost but of the son of
[33:24] men okay amen revelation of the son of
[33:29] man now I quote here this is H the
[33:34] rupture page 21
[33:36] now is the seventh Church
[33:40] age that takes the
[33:44] Rapture all of the other six
[33:49] died but Enoch was
[33:53] translated because he was not found
[33:58] God took
[34:00] him amen amen as we shall not be found
[34:04] one
[34:06] day the people of this seventh Church
[34:10] age but Enoch
[34:12] raptured was a type of all the rest of
[34:17] them was a
[34:19] type now
[34:22] uh bear with
[34:25] me now now
[34:29] uh the rupturing without
[34:36] death in imp personating I hear somebody
[34:40] saying
[34:41] that the
[34:44] rupturing
[34:46] without the Bible says he W with
[34:50] God and he was
[34:53] not there are some people here know if
[34:57] you one of them in this age who will
[35:01] walk with
[35:02] God and shall not be
[35:06] found amen amen you know if God the
[35:11] Bible says
[35:12] because God was pleased with
[35:17] Enoch he pleased
[35:20] God if you can please
[35:23] God then God will be so glad
[35:28] that he will just take you
[35:32] away he walked with God and he was not
[35:37] for God took
[35:39] him God was
[35:42] soad that he took
[35:44] him amen amen and then we read now the
[35:53] rapturing calls it the rapture ing
[35:57] without
[35:59] death now
[36:02] rupturing we find in the Bible was
[36:08] Elijah
[36:09] and let us repeat that
[36:12] again you know when the time
[36:16] arrived I want to tell you that the
[36:19] people that are going in the
[36:20] rupture they know
[36:24] themselves and they know
[36:27] they are going in the
[36:30] rupture that's why
[36:33] now I read this part you will see this
[36:36] people the Rapture is
[36:39] already potentially brother says the
[36:42] Rapture already is in
[36:46] you is that right you don't go in the
[36:50] Rapture you go like
[36:53] Enoch he walked with God
[36:57] meaning
[36:59] potentially was already in him then he
[37:03] started to
[37:04] walk you know if you go to Elijah you
[37:08] realize that you'll realize that Elijah
[37:11] knew that he's
[37:14] going amen he was waiting for that
[37:18] Chariot to come and take you because God
[37:22] before he can take you he will let you
[37:25] know
[37:27] we have already received it that we are
[37:30] going in the
[37:32] rupture those that are going in the
[37:34] rupture have already received the
[37:39] message they know
[37:42] themselves that's why they have shun the
[37:45] things of the
[37:46] woman because they know they are
[37:49] going Elijah knew that he was going and
[37:54] he started to walk towards Jordan
[37:58] with that young man who was that young
[38:01] man Elish so followed him he knew that
[38:07] and because
[38:11] asked
[38:13] ask what would you want me to do for
[38:17] you before I'm
[38:20] taken and they said your spirit what I
[38:25] need is your spirit
[38:28] now if he receiv the spirit that is in
[38:33] Elijah he must come with a
[38:37] Ministry pertaining to that the same
[38:42] Ministry amen amen you know there was a
[38:46] brother in
[38:48] De and you know about this
[38:52] story he was uh with some pastors there

[39:22] uh now I
[39:24] said uh that makes me
[39:28] happy if I can find
[39:31] somebody who is

[40:29] I'm
[40:31] AER like
[40:34] El okay amen if you don't have that
[40:38] spirit in you to be like
[40:43] God then I know you won't go
[40:47] far in the gospel of
[40:50] Christ because I told the
[40:53] pastors God himself
[40:57] said let us make
[40:59] men in
[41:03] image he made you in his
[41:09] own is that
[41:11] right so now as he made you in His
[41:18] image was the spirit in
[41:21] you wants to be like
[41:24] him because he You In His
[41:29] Image all
[41:31] right and you
[41:34] are every
[41:37] day is that spirit in
[41:40] me to be like
[41:44] him the Lord Jesus
[41:48] Christ say
[41:53] me okay amen if your
[41:57] spirit if you have a
[42:00] spirit and you don't that
[42:04] spirit is not going
[42:08] after the
[42:12] image it image because the image of our
[42:18] spirit is God
[42:21] himself all right amen now that's why
[42:28] this
[42:29] book it
[42:31] says the sons of
[42:34] God will be
[42:37] Gods which book is
[42:40] that come
[42:43] brother I can hear you Blasphemous
[42:49] names Blas names Blas name
[42:55] says do you know
[42:57] that the sons of God will be
[43:04] Gods but we have another
[43:06] book
[43:08] adoption adoption
[43:11] says our
[43:15] inheritance is our
[43:17] sunship that is our
[43:21] inheritance the prophet of God
[43:23] says that the sons
[43:27] the sons of God will be
[43:34] God and amen it went around in a
[43:38] ccle
[43:40] saying says he is
[43:44] God amen amen and I said you see
[43:48] now brother Bram says the sons of God
[43:53] will be gods
[43:58] and every message
[44:00] believer believes this
[44:03] messenger what he says the sons of God
[44:08] will be because they were made to be
[44:13] God and God himself
[44:17] now not brother so and so himself said
[44:21] let us make me in our image
[44:27] God wants you to be like
[44:31] him as a
[44:34] son amen amen amen you know every
[44:40] D it's happy when he is told
[44:44] that your son is like
[44:49] you and every
[44:51] son is happy when he is
[44:54] told you are like your
[44:59] father amen amen how many are like God
[45:03] here because God said let us make men in
[45:08] our
[45:10] image so surely if you are
[45:15] Supernatural you are looking for
[45:18] that
[45:21] image amen amen you know a supernatural
[45:24] believer
[45:26] is somebody who wants to be like his
[45:31] creator that's a
[45:33] supernatural
[45:35] believer if he sends out the Holy Spirit
[45:39] the spirit to
[45:41] us his own spirit because he wants to us
[45:46] to be like
[45:50] him can that sink until somebody say
[45:54] Amen to that
[46:00] now I said to the
[46:04] pastors it is so
[46:07] wonderful if somebody can come to you
[46:10] and
[46:13] say you want I see you want to be like
[46:19] God I think you'll be so
[46:22] happy that somebody has recognized the
[46:25] spirit that is in
[46:27] you that you want to be like
[46:31] God so it takes you back to the Book of
[46:36] Genesis us make
[46:38] man and it says again be therefore
[46:44] holy as your father in
[46:47] Heaven is
[46:50] Holy if all the
[46:54] worshipers had that
[46:56] Spirit wanting just to be like
[46:59] God would have a big I mean not a big
[47:03] church
[47:04] butal
[47:07] church amen
[47:10] amen now we've been to we've been we
[47:15] were members of Lutheran
[47:20] Church you know their testimony always
[47:23] is
[47:24] one
[47:28] they
[47:36] say were you in Lutheran
[47:42] church but do you know the the testimony
[47:45] when you are
[47:49] there don't you know the
[47:53] testimony they say
[47:57] I'm just like a
[48:01] leaf amen amen they are
[48:05] always prophesying that they are a
[48:09] leaf they are
[48:12] nothing and they even say even Jesus
[48:16] said don't say don't call me
[48:22] holy yeah is their
[48:24] testimony
[48:27] okay but let's talk about those who are
[48:32] who were made in His
[48:36] image because it comes with a a a
[48:42] nature if you are made in the image of
[48:46] God then the spirit in
[48:48] you is to be like
[48:54] him
[48:56] you know
[48:59] God knows how to do
[49:03] things he knew about his
[49:07] church the bride but how he prepared
[49:14] you that's why he
[49:16] says he said let us make
[49:21] men
[49:24] our
[49:26] God will never come to talk to
[49:29] you unless he knows that he made you in
[49:33] His
[49:35] image because if you are in the image of
[49:38] God you can hear God when he
[49:43] speaks because your
[49:46] nature is that the divine
[49:49] nature like Peter says he has given us
[49:54] divine nature
[49:57] [Applause]
[49:59] you know no man can beat his
[50:02] [Music]
[50:04] nature that's why sometimes people
[50:08] come worship and worship dance
[50:12] and the
[50:15] next they go
[50:18] off because no man can beat his
[50:24] nature
[50:26] is that right but if you are called of
[50:30] God and he gives you
[50:34] nature and that that
[50:38] nature is the nature of God
[50:43] himself so God once he has called
[50:48] you he gives you his
[50:51] nature
[50:53] and a man with the nature of
[50:57] God
[50:59] cannot
[51:03] fall right amen now there are
[51:08] people that
[51:10] are with who
[51:14] have divine
[51:17] nature did you know that if God is Holy
[51:22] then he makes his church holy
[51:27] he is worshiped by the
[51:30] people of his
[51:34] nature is that
[51:38] right let me read and
[51:42] finish
[51:44] Enoch once
[51:46] translated because he
[51:49] pleased
[51:53] God that's why
[51:56] I'm saying it's a
[51:59] season for
[52:03] change the brothers
[52:05] s even when if I can arrive home before
[52:11] the
[52:13] rupture from here I'm still going to ask
[52:16] the
[52:17] brothers to sing me the song It's a
[52:21] season for
[52:24] change
[52:26] that's why you will see here that it's a
[52:31] season for
[52:36] change I know
[52:40] that when the Rapture
[52:44] comes it will start with the ruptur in
[52:49] faith the rapturing faith you'll be
[52:53] walking like Enoch
[52:56] the Bible says he
[53:00] walked with
[53:02] [Music]
[53:04] God and he was not
[53:08] found now let me
[53:12] quote the rapturing
[53:15] fa without
[53:18] death will be called out of the seventh
[53:22] Church
[53:24] age
[53:25] which we are
[53:27] now bearing record of that
[53:33] age and he
[53:35] says let's dig
[53:38] deep amen amen okay amen now we find in
[53:44] the
[53:45] Bible there was this
[53:48] man
[53:52] elah brother can you find us
[53:55] Kings
[53:58] there you know just in the in the
[54:03] Bible as brother says scripture is a
[54:08] revelation in the
[54:11] Bible
[54:13] uh do you find
[54:16] it when you know I want that
[54:20] part
[54:21] Elijah said to Elish
[54:26] remain
[54:29] here but I want us to read it remain
[54:32] here the Lord has sent me to
[54:36] Beth can you read that
[54:38] part second Kings chapter
[54:43] 2 from verse
[54:45] two and Elijah said unto Elisha Terry
[54:50] here I pray thee for the Lord has sent
[54:52] me to bethl and Elisha said said unto
[54:55] him as the Lord leaveth and as thy soul
[54:58] leaveth I will not leave thee so they
[55:01] went down to
[55:22] bethl
[55:24] okay
[55:25] now there was something in the follower
[55:29] of
[55:33] Elijah and you can see that in the
[55:37] followers of the end time
[55:41] Prophet they have that type of spirit in
[55:48] them he said t
[55:54] here let's read this part here it says
[55:58] and Elijah said unto Elisha tell here I
[56:02] pray
[56:04] the for the Lord has sent
[56:07] me to
[56:09] Beth and El
[56:12] said as the Lord
[56:16] live and as thy Soul
[56:20] lives I will
[56:22] not leave thee
[56:29] now El elishah or
[56:32] elishah he knew exactly
[56:36] that the Throne of God was in
[56:42] Elijah he couldn't go to worship
[56:46] anywhere because he has found the place
[56:48] of
[56:50] worship you know people today are
[56:52] jumping from there to there
[56:56] come
[56:57] to with eternal
[57:03] life do you know
[57:06] that if there is a spirit in
[57:10] you
[57:11] saying I must leave this church you
[57:15] haven't yet come to the place of
[57:19] worship you'll be jumping from here to
[57:23] there and from here to
[57:29] there
[57:32] because I
[57:34] read now he says now this
[57:38] is
[57:42] Elisha Elisha
[57:44] said unto him as the Lord
[57:50] [Music]
[57:51] live
[57:53] and as thy
[57:56] Soul because the
[57:58] soul is the Throne of God as the prophet
[58:01] taught
[58:05] us now he he even saw that God was on
[58:10] the throne in
[58:15] elij now that kept him following
[58:21] Elijah as I'm saying the people today
[58:24] calling brother Bram by
[58:28] names but it means it doesn't mean
[58:32] anything to
[58:34] us because we know where the Throne of
[58:37] God
[58:40] is this young man knew that God
[58:46] lives but he lives is in his
[58:51] throne and the throne is in Elijah
[58:56] so that's why he kept on
[58:59] following and they called him a man
[59:04] follower some of the people like they do
[59:08] today that you follow a
[59:11] manuh but you know
[59:13] that Beyond this
[59:17] body there is
[59:20] God because
[59:22] God lives in a
[59:26] body and those who are
[59:29] predestinated they can see God even when
[59:32] he is in the
[59:35] body that's why the Samaritan woman
[59:39] could recognize
[59:41] Jesus as she said I know that the
[59:44] Messiah
[59:46] come the first thing he knew then
[59:49] brother Bram
[59:51] says in the book future home he says now
[59:55] that
[59:56] woman she was
[59:59] waiting for that word to be made
[1:00:04] flesh she knew
[1:00:07] that the
[1:00:09] Messiah was coming but she was waiting
[1:00:13] for it to be made
[1:00:17] flesh and when it was made flesh then
[1:00:21] she said to the people come
[1:00:26] see is this not the
[1:00:29] Christ when she was when he he was made
[1:00:36] flesh that's right amen now that's why
[1:00:40] we we are not followers of men we are
[1:00:44] followers of God in a
[1:00:48] man
[1:00:49] Amen brother is my
[1:00:53] Prophet amen amen that's why I can't get
[1:00:59] lost uhhuh amen I don't go where the
[1:01:03] people are
[1:01:04] going I just follow the prophet of
[1:01:07] God in the
[1:01:09] ministry if you want to to enter
[1:01:14] in enter
[1:01:18] now all right you just
[1:01:23] follow the way of
[1:01:25] God preached by the
[1:01:28] prophet then you will follow like
[1:01:34] Elijah here we
[1:01:36] are and it says
[1:01:41] now Elish as the Lord
[1:01:45] lives and as thy
[1:01:50] soul I will not leave thee
[1:01:56] he's saying this to
[1:02:02] Elijah I will not leave
[1:02:06] thee as long as the Lord
[1:02:09] lives is in his
[1:02:12] throne in you I shall not leave
[1:02:17] [Applause]
[1:02:18] the
[1:02:20] then amen amen because uh
[1:02:25] a real
[1:02:26] believer follows
[1:02:29] God
[1:02:31] until he he or she can see
[1:02:36] God her
[1:02:38] soul the real man is not this
[1:02:43] flesh is the
[1:02:46] soul that's the Inner
[1:02:49] Man the Inner Man worship the inner God
[1:02:55] when a prophet comes is a
[1:02:57] man but a man
[1:03:01] predestinated can see
[1:03:08] God all right now let's look at
[1:03:11] this as the Lord
[1:03:14] live and your
[1:03:16] soul he said I shall
[1:03:20] not let me read it
[1:03:23] carefully
[1:03:25] H and he said I will not leave
[1:03:33] thee so they went down to
[1:03:39] Beth amen amen
[1:03:44] they he used to to go
[1:03:48] down but now because God has come down
[1:03:52] to him
[1:03:55] God in
[1:03:56] Elijah now and the Bible says
[1:04:04] they I wonder if you
[1:04:08] also have come
[1:04:13] to and I can
[1:04:18] say for Enoch walked with God so they
[1:04:23] walked
[1:04:26] together until
[1:04:28] Enoch was no more
[1:04:33] se he
[1:04:35] says God took
[1:04:40] him are you waiting for to be
[1:04:48] taken now if you are waiting for that so
[1:04:51] you will walk with
[1:04:57] they say working with Jesus there's a
[1:05:02] song
[1:05:04] H here we are again now this is It's a
[1:05:10] season for
[1:05:14] change elishah
[1:05:16] also just like any other young men and
[1:05:19] so
[1:05:22] forth but
[1:05:24] the day it was revealed to
[1:05:27] him it was to him a
[1:05:32] season for a
[1:05:37] change he started to
[1:05:42] walk we
[1:05:44] see that
[1:05:46] was who was this
[1:05:49] man I read here now they walk together
[1:05:55] until the Bible says they Cross
[1:06:02] Jordan Jordan Speaks
[1:06:05] of
[1:06:08] death you die to
[1:06:12] yourself in order for God to live in
[1:06:18] you when you are
[1:06:21] dead like as you see
[1:06:25] me I don't have in my
[1:06:29] mind a type of a
[1:06:32] thought that one day I will join a
[1:06:36] church because I'm already
[1:06:40] [Applause]
[1:06:42] in and since I know that I canot join
[1:06:50] God you you don't go or join God
[1:06:56] God gave birth to
[1:07:01] you your
[1:07:02] parents you didn't come from somewhere
[1:07:05] from a different life or different
[1:07:10] walk and to join a man and a woman and
[1:07:14] said you are my
[1:07:17] parents you were
[1:07:21] born by
[1:07:22] them
[1:07:25] that's why the Bible says he that is
[1:07:28] born of God cannot
[1:07:33] [Applause]
[1:07:36] sin why because the
[1:07:40] reason why he can't sin because he is
[1:07:44] born of
[1:07:47] God now if you are born of God you have
[1:07:50] the nature of your
[1:07:52] father
[1:07:56] and the Bible says you can't
[1:08:02] sin you ask the Bible the reason why
[1:08:06] this one can
[1:08:08] s because is born of
[1:08:14] God that is the
[1:08:17] answer I see the people
[1:08:20] today appearing on YouTube and
[1:08:26] because some people want to be seen by
[1:08:33] men you see everybody wants to do

[1:11:52] today
[1:11:54] uh you see next time
[1:11:57] somebody appearing
[1:12:00] also
[1:12:01] saying he's teaching the people to read
[1:12:04] the spoken
[1:12:05] word but the real Spirit behind
[1:12:10] that he or she wants to
[1:12:16] appear hey there are many
[1:12:20] today some are showing the people how to
[1:12:23] apply
[1:12:28] Vaseline they're just thinking
[1:12:32] of to do something so that she or he can
[1:12:36] appear on the

[1:13:06] appear okay but the real son or daughter
[1:13:11] of
[1:13:12] God to appear in
[1:13:17] Christ myself they know even my
[1:13:22] grandchildren or
[1:13:24] tell them that you never
[1:13:28] never put me in those
[1:13:34] things well preaching is something
[1:13:37] else is
[1:13:40] preaching people don't like
[1:13:43] it but for a man to appear there will
[1:13:48] say he's teaching the people how to
[1:13:51] apply Vel
[1:13:55] but the main thing is not that the main
[1:13:59] thing he wants or she wants to
[1:14:01] [Music]

[1:14:07] he shall
[1:14:08] appear shall be like
[1:14:13] him a real son and daughter of
[1:14:16] God wants to see himself or himself in

[1:14:48] gospel but apart from that I'm not part
[1:14:52] of it
[1:14:54] I don't want to reflect
[1:14:58] that
[1:15:01] because
[1:15:03] Christ is our
[1:15:08] reflection all right amen okay Brothers
[1:15:13] before we close now the Lord
[1:15:17] willing this
[1:15:19] season
[1:15:21] for change
[1:15:26] it
[1:15:29] says last we were reading from the book
[1:15:32] which I don't have here with me
[1:15:35] now how brother
[1:15:37] bran
[1:15:40] saw the
[1:15:43] angels in the form of a pyramid
[1:15:48] pyramid
[1:15:50] because the pyramid that we have
[1:15:54] now it's not that pyramid
[1:15:58] pyramid of
[1:16:02] stones or where you
[1:16:04] find the seven
[1:16:08] Messengers the first
[1:16:10] pyramid types and speaks of even the the
[1:16:14] the the seven Angel
[1:16:19] Messengers but the second pyramid it
[1:16:24] says it speaks of the
[1:16:28] Angels brother
[1:16:31] saw the
[1:16:33] Angels the pyramid pyramid the Angels
[1:16:37] Came From
[1:16:40] eternity and these
[1:16:42] angels they came from
[1:16:46] eternity all right this first he says
[1:16:50] are men from the the Earthly men
[1:16:56] pyamid with this messenger
[1:16:59] seven but this one that

[1:17:44] things says the
[1:17:47] prophet did you know that the world is
[1:17:51] struggling the
[1:17:54] seal and brother Bram said it's not to
[1:17:58] the

[1:18:09] seals the seals were opened by the seven
[1:18:15] seal amen am now let's come to this the
[1:18:20] seventh seal I'm trying to find

[1:19:01] things that is Page 553 book
[1:19:06] of that's right the things written in
[1:19:10] the seven seal
[1:19:12] book sealed up of the Plan of
[1:19:17] Redemption because brother says the day
[1:19:21] of redemption is the day the book was
[1:19:28] opened do you know where it is it is in
[1:19:32] the here in the book The Day
[1:19:36] of

[1:20:46] you you see that
[1:20:49] brother hey that brother was full of the
[1:20:51] Holy Ghost
[1:20:55] said and
[1:20:57] then you know along the way things
[1:21:00] happen
[1:21:02] and okay but the Lord said this Spirit
[1:21:06] shall be in
[1:21:11] you not until there's a
[1:21:15] problem

[1:22:01] went I love God so
[1:22:08] much I was told one day that that very
[1:22:13] same Pastor has done this and
[1:22:17] this amen amen like you see how we have
[1:22:22] painted in the
[1:22:26] television by the
[1:22:29] people saying we are this we are that we
[1:22:32] are
[1:22:33] that and now for the people who don't
[1:22:37] love
[1:22:38] God it comes as like as a blessing
[1:22:43] like they say if can do
[1:22:48] this
[1:22:50] we What About Us
[1:22:57] okay you don't become a Christian
[1:22:59] because somebody's a
[1:23:02] Christian you you become a
[1:23:05] Christian because you are
[1:23:12] predestinated okay now I'm trying to
[1:23:15] read to you this
[1:23:18] part brother Bram speaking about the
[1:23:23] of
[1:23:28] redemption you know to
[1:23:31] redeem the prophet told you what the
[1:23:33] word
[1:23:36] means he says hold
[1:23:39] that that is
[1:23:41] in page
[1:23:45] 78 maybe if you don't find it in your
[1:23:48] book this in
[1:23:50] another it says hold
[1:23:56] that you know uh that what do you call
[1:24:01] this
[1:24:08] thing now
[1:24:16] the hold
[1:24:18] that he says hold
[1:24:21] that the word
[1:24:25] Redemption until the day that the book
[1:24:29] of redemption has been
[1:24:34] revealed read it for us brother in the
[1:24:37] Bible God bless you
[1:24:39] there Redemption Ephesians
[1:24:44] 4:3 and grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:24:47] God whereby you are Saed unto the day of
[1:24:51] redemption
[1:24:57] no look here until the day now I quote
[1:25:02] brother until that day the book of
[1:25:05] redemption has been
[1:25:12] revealed the day of
[1:25:15] redemption says is the day the book is
[1:25:21] revealed
[1:25:25] and
[1:25:26] redeem the Redeemer comes claim his
[1:25:34] possession that is the day of
[1:25:37] redemption when the
[1:25:39] book is revealed you know the Bible
[1:25:44] says this
[1:25:46] book there was Revelation chapter
[1:25:50] 5 the one that on the throne with a book
[1:25:54] in his right hand
[1:25:58] side and the lamp came and took the book
[1:26:03] from the one that set
[1:26:08] the from the right
[1:26:10] hand
[1:26:12] side you see we come with that for
[1:26:16] brother tells us that of the angel on
[1:26:19] the right hand
[1:26:21] side
[1:26:23] even job will come with that speaks of
[1:26:31] that and that's why now we find that the
[1:26:35] the people of
[1:26:37] God are residing on the
[1:26:40] right
[1:26:44] side because when the book was given it
[1:26:49] came from the right hand side
[1:26:52] down to the
[1:26:54] angel on the right
[1:26:58] side it's so
[1:27:01] wonderful only if we can see
[1:27:04] it the hand the book was in the right
[1:27:09] hand that's why it says he after he has
[1:27:14] done the work Redemption he he set on
[1:27:17] the right hand
[1:27:21] side
[1:27:25] now I always tell the children of
[1:27:29] God that the
[1:27:31] angel which we shall come with that
[1:27:35] angel was on the right hand
[1:27:38] side so the people of God were looking
[1:27:42] at the right hand
[1:27:44] side because the book was on the right
[1:27:48] hand
[1:27:50] side and when it was given given it was
[1:27:53] given to the
[1:27:55] angel in the
[1:27:57] pyramid but on the right hand
[1:28:02] side we'll come to see
[1:28:05] that all right now to end
[1:28:10] this it says now that that is what is
[1:28:15] that
[1:28:16] title go again the seven times sorry go
[1:28:21] again seven times the
[1:28:24] title the seven times no no what is the
[1:28:28] title season of change a
[1:28:33] season amen amen it's a season for
[1:28:40] change
[1:28:42] so next time I'll ask the brothers to
[1:28:45] sing
[1:28:51] this
[1:28:53] why why I should
[1:28:56] change it is because even the
[1:29:00] pyramid has
[1:29:02] changed
[1:29:04] hallu it is now it is called now pyramid
[1:29:08] of
[1:29:12] angels
[1:29:13] so I must go around
[1:29:17] again seven
[1:29:20] times again that's why they said go
[1:29:24] round about the
[1:29:27] the
[1:29:29] city seven
[1:29:31] times and on the seventh
[1:29:35] day each day you they went round about
[1:29:42] once but he said on the but on the
[1:29:45] seventh
[1:29:47] day you go round
[1:29:50] about go it says go
[1:29:54] again seven
[1:29:58] times
[1:30:01] change to a seven times now I see here
[1:30:06] that brother Bram was changed from this
[1:30:11] pyramid
[1:30:13] pyramid and that is called the Pyramid
[1:30:16] of
[1:30:18] angels is that
[1:30:20] right okay
[1:30:23] this is just part of
[1:30:25] it the Lord willing if the Rapture don't
[1:30:28] come
[1:30:29] tonight will come with another
[1:30:32] part of this
[1:30:35] book and look
[1:30:38] at there is something here I was looking
[1:30:43] at
[1:30:46] right
[1:30:48] uh sh we let me read this one we must
[1:30:52] remember that the seventh
[1:30:56] seal is the
[1:30:58] end of
[1:31:00] time of all
[1:31:04] things amen amen that's right the things
[1:31:09] written in the seven sealed
[1:31:12] book sealed
[1:31:14] up of the Plan of
[1:31:18] Redemption what is what the Redemption
[1:31:20] stands for
[1:31:25] okay brother taugh
[1:31:28] us about this to
[1:31:33] redeem the
[1:31:35] Redeemer came to
[1:31:40] redeem that's why and there's another
[1:31:43] thing in the
[1:31:45] Bible when it
[1:31:48] speaks about the king's man
[1:31:58] how do you explain the king man what is
[1:32:06] that what's a king's man family man
[1:32:11] right family man that's a king
[1:32:17] man now brother B we you know we went
[1:32:21] through that
[1:32:25] brother taught me
[1:32:27] here of this King
[1:32:32] man when I realized that the King's Men
[1:32:38] speaks of a member of the
[1:32:44] family then I said
[1:32:50] that
[1:32:52] that wased
[1:32:54] me was the blood of the
[1:33:00] king then he spoke about the kingsman
[1:33:08] Redeemer meaning that the Lord Jesus
[1:33:12] Christ is my family
[1:33:16] [Applause]
[1:33:18] man is
[1:33:20] it
[1:33:22] is it hard to say the Lord Jesus is my
[1:33:28] family I'm not saying family
[1:33:34] in I'm talking
[1:33:36] about this kind of
[1:33:42] family he made
[1:33:44] us in his own
[1:33:48] image and that's
[1:33:50] why says
[1:33:52] when the angel
[1:33:56] Gabriel when that angel come
[1:34:00] to
[1:34:04] Mary he says the angel
[1:34:08] came with the
[1:34:11] word but the word that he gave to
[1:34:15] Mary and Mary believed that
[1:34:18] word it became blood in Mary's
[1:34:26] I made sure and read it I read it
[1:34:31] again what are you saying
[1:34:36] kman the message that Mary brought to
[1:34:41] that Gabriel brought to
[1:34:45] Mary when Mary believed that
[1:34:50] word
[1:34:52] the word became
[1:34:56] blood I said all right that means if we
[1:35:00] believe the word of
[1:35:02] God really like
[1:35:04] Mary becomes
[1:35:08] blood and it became blood in
[1:35:14] Mary so meaning
[1:35:16] that as we are Washed by the blood of
[1:35:22] the king
[1:35:24] man the word that we have
[1:35:28] received he says and that word when it
[1:35:31] is in
[1:35:33] us it is the blood of Jesus
[1:35:36] Christ because the book of ex says we
[1:35:40] are saved by the blood of
[1:35:46] God all
[1:35:48] right so you you are the bloodline
[1:35:57] people the bloodline
[1:36:02] people when it says I don't have that
[1:36:07] book
[1:36:10] here uh as I am
[1:36:14] closing I had something this
[1:36:19] morning that spoke to me
[1:36:22] that brother
[1:36:26] says everything that was
[1:36:29] created has an
[1:36:34] end you know the book brother I don't
[1:36:38] have it with me
[1:36:39] here okay
[1:36:42] everything that was
[1:36:50] created what happened to that has an
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:36:58] in your body was
[1:37:01] created but not your
[1:37:05] soul the soul was not
[1:37:10] created okay what happened
[1:37:14] is the body the soul was
[1:37:20] processed because the the soul is part
[1:37:24] of
[1:37:26] God that's why brother
[1:37:30] says the word says the soul is the
[1:37:35] throne in a man because when God
[1:37:41] performs God is he comes to the
[1:37:46] soul for his Dwelling
[1:37:49] Place he dwells in in your
[1:37:54] soul not in your
[1:37:56] head because in your head it becomes a
[1:38:02] theology dwells in your
[1:38:06] soul then they say you are like
[1:38:12] God all right amen now I always look at
[1:38:18] these
[1:38:19] things and that's why the Prophet
[1:38:22] says everything that was
[1:38:27] created has
[1:38:32] an and then even this morning I was
[1:38:35] looking at
[1:38:36] it brother don't worry we will still
[1:38:40] read it I come with it the prophet of
[1:38:43] God says everything that was
[1:38:48] created I can prove to you yesterday has
[1:38:52] an I can prove to you that the Bible
[1:38:56] says in the beginning God created the
[1:39:02] Earth Heaven and the
[1:39:05] Earth then afterwards it says Heaven and
[1:39:09] Earth pass
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:12] away are you
[1:39:15] there God
[1:39:17] created heaven and earth and the same
[1:39:20] God said
[1:39:22] Heaven and Earth shall pass
[1:39:25] away but my word shall not pass
[1:39:32] away all
[1:39:34] right that's why if you want to be
[1:39:39] rich and go to and
[1:39:42] fr to make a lot of
[1:39:46] money already the word has said
[1:39:51] that will pass
[1:39:55] away I don't want to inherit a thing
[1:39:59] that will pass
[1:40:01] away that God told me
[1:40:04] that it will pass
[1:40:06] [Music]
[1:40:09] away I can come back to you again and
[1:40:12] say you have a new car there in the
[1:40:17] Gage and the same car
[1:40:21] you will find it in a
[1:40:25] scrapyard but if you go to the garage it
[1:40:29] is
[1:40:32] new
[1:40:34] then they even through a party at
[1:40:40] home that our son has bought a new
[1:40:44] car of 1 million so so 1
[1:40:48] million but there script a scard
[1:40:54] there and a car of the same
[1:41:00] quality you see in
[1:41:03] theage I think if you come
[1:41:06] driving one million
[1:41:08] car and you see one in the
[1:41:13] scard I think it breaks your
[1:41:16] heart meaning that this car is coming
[1:41:25] when a child is born another one is
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:32] buried amen amen when we are
[1:41:36] celebrating the birth of a
[1:41:39] child it's a good
[1:41:44] thing yet
[1:41:47] one another one is buried
[1:41:52] it's not a
[1:41:56] celebration all right they come
[1:42:01] and
[1:42:05] go why we are sticking to the word of
[1:42:10] God is because we know that all things
[1:42:13] shall pass
[1:42:18] away you can own the whole
[1:42:21] the
[1:42:23] money collect the
[1:42:29] money it is like these
[1:42:32] people who sold their
[1:42:38] soaps and for a
[1:42:43] change to do money
[1:42:48] rituals selling their souls
[1:42:52] the world that we are living in is very
[1:42:55] funny we have people who are walking
[1:42:59] around
[1:43:04] withouts just for money that's why the
[1:43:07] Bible says the love of money is the root
[1:43:11] of all
[1:43:15] evil
[1:43:18] amen there's no liar like a person who
[1:43:22] has the Love of
[1:43:26] Money the Bible says the
[1:43:31] root of
[1:43:38] all it killed
[1:43:44] Judas and Lord Jesus
[1:43:49] said it would be
[1:43:54] better if he were not
[1:43:57] born
[1:43:59] Judas did you do you know
[1:44:04] that meaning
[1:44:07] that what will happen to him is going to
[1:44:10] happen to
[1:44:11] him so
[1:44:16] terrible it's better if Judas was not
[1:44:22] B because what he's going to go
[1:44:27] through for betraying the son of
[1:44:31] man it's a terrible
[1:44:35] thing did you see tribulation is
[1:44:39] coming will the Lord
[1:44:42] willing will see those things
[1:44:45] tribulation is
[1:44:49] coming have you seen the
[1:44:58] signs
[1:45:02] today it's just the
[1:45:05] end
[1:45:07] [Music]
[1:45:08] Finish and the bride is just waiting for
[1:45:11] the
[1:45:15] rupture the Saints in
[1:45:19] Israel
[1:45:25] you see the Saints
[1:45:28] [Applause]
[1:45:29] everywhere because the time for the Lord
[1:45:34] to go back to is to
[1:45:39] the so
[1:45:43] close and it won't happen it will only
[1:45:48] happen after the
[1:45:51] the
[1:45:53] rupture so the rupture must take
[1:45:57] place so that the Lord can go back to
[1:46:01] the
[1:46:03] Jews now the time of the
[1:46:05] Jews out
[1:46:09] already I mean the time of the
[1:46:13] Gentiles is
[1:46:15] over so the Rapture is coming the signs
[1:46:19] are there talking about it everywhere
[1:46:24] the rupture even the
[1:46:26] unbelievers because it's coming up even
[1:46:28] in the
[1:46:29] television showing the Rapture what is
[1:46:33] happening in Israel now all the signs
[1:46:36] are pointing to the
[1:46:39] rupture amen amen but the people who
[1:46:43] know better about that the of
[1:46:49] Christ
[1:46:51] because the prophet says it is already
[1:46:55] working in it is already in
[1:46:59] you and that is called the
[1:47:05] rupturing R rapturing faith meaning
[1:47:10] that already in
[1:47:13] you you are
[1:47:15] walking towards what you
[1:47:19] see amen I wondered when the Bible
[1:47:26] said Enoch walked with
[1:47:31] God
[1:47:33] and he was
[1:47:38] not
[1:47:40] and
[1:47:41] today I know what it
[1:47:45] means to walk with
[1:47:49] God
[1:47:50] amen elishah walked with
[1:47:56] Elijah he followed
[1:48:00] Elijah because the Rapture was already
[1:48:04] in
[1:48:06] Elijah he was going to be taken up in a
[1:48:11] chariot and Elijah knew
[1:48:14] it people that are going in the rupture
[1:48:18] they know it
[1:48:21] and they are working towards
[1:48:23] it they know already that they are
[1:48:31] going
[1:48:35] interrupt they don't look
[1:48:38] back now Enoch knew
[1:48:42] that when he was
[1:48:47] working with
[1:48:49] God he had the rapturing
[1:48:53] faith then he knew he was
[1:48:57] going Elijah knew that the Chariot is
[1:49:01] coming he knew that he was going and
[1:49:04] there are people here they know that
[1:49:07] they are
[1:49:10] going amen amen because brother Bram
[1:49:15] says the rupture potentially is in you
[1:49:24] the Rapture don't just
[1:49:26] come by
[1:49:29] surprise no when it is
[1:49:32] coming it will potentially be given to
[1:49:35] the
[1:49:37] bride and the
[1:49:39] bride will be
[1:49:41] prepared for a
[1:49:45] change because he the briad is changing
[1:49:49] already
[1:49:53] you
[1:49:54] know the people they have started to
[1:49:57] quit doing wrong
[1:50:02] things what what makes them to do
[1:50:06] that is that
[1:50:08] Faith rupturing
[1:50:10] Faith they know that they are
[1:50:15] [Applause]
[1:50:17] going I don't know somebody who knows
[1:50:21] that he's
[1:50:22] going he start to change while
[1:50:27] working living with the
[1:50:29] people is already
[1:50:33] changing amen he's looking up knowing
[1:50:38] that one of these
[1:50:41] days she will meet the Lord in the
[1:50:47] end I I want to stop
[1:50:52] yeah but only to
[1:50:57] continue with
[1:51:01] SE for
[1:51:05] change but one thing I'm thankful
[1:51:11] [Music]
[1:51:12] of is when brother
[1:51:16] said potentially it is in you
[1:51:22] and I believe it
[1:51:25] because I know what he
[1:51:29] meant all right amen they'll go to and
[1:51:34] fro changing
[1:51:37] positions but the bride of
[1:51:39] Christ
[1:51:41] potential is in the
[1:51:44] bride she's not
[1:51:47] confused she won't go to and through
[1:51:50] changing places
[1:51:52] and because once in
[1:51:55] Christ always in
[1:52:01] Christ I feel like this shall We Stand
[1:52:08] Up amen
[1:52:12] amen I think you'll allow us to
[1:52:16] continue next
[1:52:18] time
[1:52:21] the same
[1:52:23] message it is a
[1:52:26] season for
[1:52:30] change as we are going to get
[1:52:34] into the Pyramid of
[1:52:39] angels brother Bram says a
[1:52:44] itself is made like a
[1:52:48] pyramid
[1:52:50] did you hear
[1:52:57] him but maybe you haven't yet noticed
[1:53:03] that we still come to the white
[1:53:07] stone that was within the
[1:53:13] pyramid was the White
[1:53:15] St found that was in the
[1:53:18] pyramid
[1:53:20] amen amen so greater is he that is in
[1:53:28] you the one that is in the
[1:53:32] world
[1:53:34] Amen
[1:53:36] that's that's why we meet
[1:53:39] him in the
[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:48] clouds
[1:53:53] and I'm going to ask our
