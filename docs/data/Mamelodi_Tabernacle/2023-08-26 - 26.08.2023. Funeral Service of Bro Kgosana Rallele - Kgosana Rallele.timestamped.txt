[1:16:35] another scripture
[1:16:39] Romans chapter 8

[1:16:44] this
[1:16:46] 18-23 Romans chapter 8 from Verse 18 to
[1:16:50] 23
[1:16:54] for I reckon that the suffering of this
[1:16:57] present time are not worthy to be
[1:17:00] compared with that Glory which shall be
[1:17:03] revealed in US
[1:17:04] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:17:07] creature waited for the manifestation of
[1:17:10] the sons of God for the creature was
[1:17:13] made subject to vanity not willing but
[1:17:17] by reason of him who has subjected the
[1:17:19] same in Hope
[1:17:21] because the Creator itself also shall be
[1:17:24] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:17:27] into the Glorious Liberty of the
[1:17:30] children of God for we know that the
[1:17:32] whole creation grownness and
[1:17:34] surveillance in pain together until now
[1:17:37] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:17:40] which have the
[1:17:42] first fruits of the spirit even we
[1:17:45] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[1:17:48] for the adoption to wait the Redemption
[1:17:51] of our body
[1:17:53] you may be seated God bless you like
[1:18:00] [Music]

[1:18:19] bury foreign
[1:18:35] time Jesus came to the funeral of
[1:18:38] Lazarus
[1:18:45] because we are in a journey all of us
[1:18:49] did you know that
[1:18:55] the bodies we have put on
[1:18:58] uh
[1:19:02] the Redemption of our body that is why
[1:19:05] the Bible is talking about topology
[1:19:11] spiritually we are redeemed
[1:19:15] but we are still waiting for the
[1:19:17] Redemption of our bodies
[1:19:24] okay I mean
[1:19:26] you are redeemed
[1:19:33] that we are still in the body of
[1:19:36] motor
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:41] and
[1:19:42] waiting for
[1:19:44] your true body
[1:19:51] I was saying
[1:19:54] there was a young man who came to to me

[1:20:13] foreign
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:46] you know
[1:20:49] you
[1:20:51] the people in mamelodi
[1:20:56] no this is
[1:21:06] it is like a person who's going to he
[1:21:10] was talking like a person
[1:21:12] foreign
[1:21:28] then driving past a scrap yard
[1:21:35] or not discouraged
[1:21:40] agree
[1:21:44] ing because
[1:21:48] this is
[1:21:59] also coming there foreign
[1:22:09] I remember let me repeat this to you
[1:22:14] I was with a brother a brother
[1:22:21] and take us
[1:22:26] and
[1:22:28] now
[1:22:32] so they were they were showing us the
[1:22:35] coffins
[1:22:37] now the sixth lady gamola hello
[1:22:42] the brother introduced me to the sales
[1:22:45] lady
[1:22:51] she said oh okay come let let me show
[1:22:55] you the best coffins
[1:23:00] then you can choose one for your pasta
[1:23:05] now he said the best
[1:23:09] so we followed yeah
[1:23:14] to the other the other side of
[1:23:17] um
[1:23:25] she said
[1:23:28] then you can choose your password just
[1:23:32] from these ones I was laughing
[1:23:35] the body our bodies
[1:23:42] oh
[1:23:46] the best coffee whether they bury me
[1:23:49] yeah
[1:23:52] foreign
[1:24:17] we wish
[1:24:27] but all that is
[1:24:35] we say we are pilgrims on this Earth
[1:24:39] all right I mean now everything is
[1:24:47] just but tempura
[1:24:50] and that's why
[1:24:52] if you go to the graveyard
[1:24:57] is
[1:24:58] more with the stone there I guess
[1:25:03] where they always put the history of
[1:25:06] somebody
[1:25:10] I've never seen
[1:25:13] one I say because
[1:25:18] reading that
[1:25:20] he was
[1:25:22] a rich man who
[1:25:26] or he was a poor man
[1:25:32] and then I realized
[1:25:36] foreign
[1:26:04] uh
[1:26:06] you know in that Bible it says our
[1:26:10] citizenship Arena
[1:26:14] in heaven
[1:26:16] but now let me
[1:26:20] let us just drive a bed
[1:26:25] I want to look at the funeral attended
[1:26:28] by the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:35] we will know that
[1:26:42] Jesus Christ
[1:26:45] being our life
[1:26:51] amen amen I'm going to read this
[1:26:54] scripture
[1:26:57] the way to
[1:27:00] the funeral of Lazarus
[1:27:05] now if you look into your Bible
[1:27:09] Jesus has never attended any funeral
[1:27:12] Jesus
[1:27:14] because he is the resurrection
[1:27:17] now Resurrection cannot attend a funeral
[1:27:24] that's why when he arrived
[1:27:35] because my time is just here
[1:27:40] when he met Martha
[1:27:44] on his way not to the funeral
[1:27:48] but to the resurrection
[1:27:52] you remember a damselves
[1:27:57] and when Jesus was told of Dutch
[1:28:03] 11.
[1:28:29] [Music]
[1:28:46] uh the Lord Jesus was told about the
[1:28:49] death of lazarusa
[1:28:53] and it says when Jesus hated that yeah
[1:28:57] that Lazarus was sick
[1:29:02] he said ah
[1:29:05] his
[1:29:06] this sickness is not unto death
[1:29:12] but for the glory of God foreign
[1:29:31] God can do things
[1:29:35] that will leave us
[1:29:37] wondering
[1:29:40] foreign
[1:29:56] because every time somebody is sick
[1:30:01] we think of death
[1:30:05] amen amen now let's look at it now he
[1:30:09] arrived at Master oh at the place where
[1:30:12] Martha dwells
[1:30:17] then Martha Bello Marta
[1:30:21] I'll start here
[1:30:24] then Mata as soon as she hit that Jesus
[1:30:28] was coming
[1:30:31] this is
[1:30:33] John 11 20. go John 11 verse 20.
[1:30:38] went and met you
[1:30:41] but Mary said still in the house
[1:30:46] um
[1:30:49] then set Martha unto Jesus
[1:30:53] Lord Moran if thou has been here
[1:30:57] my brother
[1:31:03] she was trying to
[1:31:05] console Jesus
[1:31:11] but I know that you can see now
[1:31:15] whatsoever
[1:31:16] ask of God
[1:31:20] God will give it to thee um
[1:31:26] Jesus said unto him my brother
[1:31:31] rise again
[1:31:35] Martha said unto him I know that
[1:31:38] he shall rise again in the resurrection
[1:31:42] at the last days
[1:31:49] she was also giving out what she knew
[1:31:55] foreign
[1:32:04] I am the resurrection
[1:32:10] he never said all right let us discuss
[1:32:12] this
[1:32:16] you are talking to the resurrection
[1:32:21] I mean I mean
[1:32:23] and I am the resurrection
[1:32:38] amen amen
[1:32:41] and
[1:32:43] whosoever
[1:32:45] lives or a pillar and Believes In Me
[1:32:50] shall never die
[1:32:59] she said
[1:33:02] unto him yeah Lord I believe
[1:33:07] that thou art the Christ the son of God
[1:33:11] you should come into the world
[1:33:24] she arose quickly and came unto him away
[1:33:29] now Jesus was not yet in the town
[1:33:34] on his way foreign
[1:33:42] amen amen
[1:33:45] that was the route
[1:33:49] to
[1:33:50] the tomb to lazarusa
[1:33:54] now you know one thing Masa didn't
[1:33:58] understand
[1:34:01] if Jesus says I am the resurrection
[1:34:07] he didn't say I have them
[1:34:14] and
[1:34:16] yeah Martha Marta thought she was
[1:34:19] talking to a mere man
[1:34:22] she didn't know that she was talking to
[1:34:26] the resurrection
[1:34:30] and the resurrection cannot attend
[1:34:32] anything
[1:34:37] do you know that yeah when they come
[1:34:40] together
[1:34:41] they can't come together
[1:34:43] when Jesus comes he is the resurrection
[1:34:48] and that's why he says
[1:34:52] now it took Mata a very long time
[1:34:58] then Jesus
[1:35:01] then the Jews which were with her in the
[1:35:05] house
[1:35:10] Jesus arrived there it's yes she was
[1:35:14] well comforted
[1:35:15] when they saw Mary that she rose up
[1:35:21] and went uh
[1:35:25] out followed her saying she goes unto
[1:35:29] the grace
[1:35:35] and then when Mary was come
[1:35:40] where Jesus was and saw him she fell
[1:35:45] down at his feet
[1:35:51] if that was being here
[1:35:59] amen he reversed the whole thing
[1:36:03] if only if foreign
[1:36:06] now he died because
[1:36:12] when Jesus therefore saw him
[1:36:19] and
[1:36:21] he said and the Jews also weeping which
[1:36:26] came in with her he groomed in the
[1:36:32] spirit
[1:36:34] and was troubled
[1:36:39] and said where have he laid him I really
[1:36:43] made a guy and yet Jesus knew where he
[1:36:47] was
[1:36:54] they said unto him Lord come and see
[1:36:59] he followed them just like amen
[1:37:03] Jesus also wept TJ so Leonardo he wept
[1:37:08] and
[1:37:10] not that Lazarus is dead
[1:37:14] no because he looked at the
[1:37:18] people
[1:37:19] was gifted to see the people crying
[1:37:27] all right I mean that was the
[1:37:29] resurrection
[1:37:35] that was the Redemption
[1:37:46] then that's why we thank God today
[1:37:49] he took the form of man foreign
[1:38:05] but she died for us it was not an
[1:38:09] accident when Jesus died
[1:38:13] that's why he said father forgive them
[1:38:20] he has plenty yeah now we plan
[1:38:23] his death
[1:38:24] commanded by him
[1:38:27] he has planned that his death
[1:38:31] the Lord Jesus because as a redeemer
[1:38:35] it is only by his blood yes
[1:38:39] we can be redeemed it takes blood
[1:38:43] not not a prayer
[1:38:48] that's why he is called the King's Men
[1:38:54] yes I mean and then so we were saved
[1:38:58] everybody
[1:39:06] meaning that uh
[1:39:11] we are
[1:39:12] part of him
[1:39:17] after the fall of Adam
[1:39:21] then he played with a plan
[1:39:25] he came with the Plan of Redemption
[1:39:28] is to take something back together
[1:39:35] okay
[1:39:37] then lastly
[1:39:41] let's arrive here again
[1:39:44] foreign
[1:39:59] this man which opened the eyes of the
[1:40:02] blind of course that have have caused
[1:40:06] that even this men should not have died
[1:40:14] again groaning in himself
[1:40:20] it was a cave
[1:40:23] the Bible this Bible says it was a cave
[1:40:27] and a stone lay upon it is
[1:40:35] [Music]
[1:40:40] you know
[1:40:41] uh he gave back to the man what belonged
[1:40:45] to the man
[1:40:47] where have you ladies
[1:40:51] foreign
[1:41:07] amen amen
[1:41:10] Martha the sister of him that was dead
[1:41:18] you know they had some sprays and all
[1:41:20] that never displayed
[1:41:24] they were lecture in Jesus
[1:41:30] for he has been dead four days we
[1:41:37] then
[1:41:40] Jesus said yes sir
[1:41:43] I said I not unto thee that if thou
[1:41:47] would have believed thou should
[1:41:51] I should have seen the glory of God
[1:41:54] Jesus
[1:41:58] then they took away the stone
[1:42:01] and Jesus the Lord Jesus because he said
[1:42:06] he said to the disciples
[1:42:09] Lazarus is dead
[1:42:14] foreign
[1:42:24] he didn't say let us go to his funeral
[1:42:28] because he is the resurrection he can't
[1:42:31] attend again
[1:42:36] okay I mean
[1:42:41] let us go unto Aryan Korean
[1:42:48] all right I mean to Jesus was alive
[1:42:54] because Lazarus was in Jesus
[1:42:59] when he was coming to the uh
[1:43:03] we call it Grace
[1:43:06] he came with the soulless
[1:43:15] now that's why
[1:43:18] have you ladies
[1:43:21] that is
[1:43:24] talking about the body of Lazada
[1:43:27] not Lazarus because Lazarus is

[1:43:51] mother the sister said
[1:43:54] hey Morella Lord

[1:44:05] said unto him in closing now
[1:44:11] are not unto thee that if thou who just
[1:44:15] believe
[1:44:19] thou should say the glory of God
[1:44:27] then they took away the stool
[1:44:31] from the place
[1:44:35] because already
[1:44:37] in this body it is like I am buried
[1:44:42] because this body
[1:44:46] is the body of
[1:44:49] the ground the ground
[1:44:51] of us or the Earth
