[54:26] Same Spirit Heavenly Father we have seen
[54:28] it in our pastor and heavenly father
[54:30] that is why even this morning we will be
[54:32] able to locate that it is still the same
[54:35] God who is hiding in our brother marar
[54:38] we pray for him Lord Almighty that you
[54:40] just come and Inspire him you just
[54:42] Heavenly Father come and H take control

[54:58] service into your hands knowing that
[55:00] Heavenly Father since your presence is

[55:14] amen
[55:16] hallelujah the prayer of our
[55:22] brother has just said it
[55:25] all my my message this
[55:27] morning so God has never made a
[55:30] mistake we will fly together you will
[55:34] enjoy the message you will indulge on it
[55:38] you will meditate about it is the one
[55:41] that is taking us back
[55:43] home amen amen Revelation 1 verse 16
[55:48] only that one verse Revelation 1: 16
[55:54] amen and he had in his right hand Seven
[55:58] Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp
[56:01] two-edged SW and his countenance was as
[56:04] the sun shineth in his strength amen
[56:08] amen so there's no one for it's okay you
[56:12] may have your
[56:13] seat you can read it for us God bless
[56:17] [Music]
[56:46] amen amen God bless
[56:48] you
[56:52] um the title is still the same it's the
[56:55] part two
[56:58] as we need
[57:01] access to the tree of
[57:04] life because the access was always
[57:09] denied for many years for more than
[57:13] 6,000
[57:15] years the access was
[57:17] denied so we we need
[57:20] access to the tree of
[57:23] life and we have it today
[57:27] amen
[57:28] amen let me read what the prophet says
[57:32] here from the message of the seven
[57:35] Church
[57:36] ages seven Church ages he said all
[57:39] right if the tree of
[57:43] life is a
[57:45] person then the tree of
[57:48] knowledge of Good and Evil is a person
[57:51] as
[57:53] well it can be otherwise
[57:56] that's the righteous
[57:58] one and the wicked
[58:01] one stood side by
[58:04] side there in the midst of the Garden of
[58:09] Eden so we speak about the tree of
[58:14] life and the Tree of Life the man of God
[58:19] says the person it's a human being and
[58:24] the tree of knowledge
[58:26] of
[58:27] evil and the good was a person as well
[58:33] that means there were two
[58:35] persons in the Garden of
[58:38] Eden then it
[58:40] depends where you
[58:42] par if
[58:45] you from the Tree of Good and
[58:48] Evil it brings
[58:51] death and if we
[58:53] partake from the Tree of Life
[58:57] being a
[58:58] person then we have
[59:02] life amen so since
[59:05] well they
[59:07] part from the Tree of Good and
[59:12] Evil and
[59:14] evil death came
[59:17] in but the plan of God is we need to
[59:21] have access to the Tree of Life
[59:26] the one of Good and
[59:27] Evil and it was a
[59:31] process it was taking time to get back
[59:36] there so last time when I was here I
[59:40] show you kind of a
[59:42] pyramid how it
[59:44] started as an
[59:47] exposition then going up to the climate
[59:50] and then coming down until to the
[59:55] resolution
[59:56] conclusion like like when you read a
[59:59] book when you start you start it but not
[1:00:04] understanding but as time goes by you
[1:00:07] started to have a clear
[1:00:10] picture but when you come to an end the
[1:00:13] conclusion of the book then you start to
[1:00:16] have the understanding then for you to
[1:00:19] have the real
[1:00:20] understanding you must read it
[1:00:23] again then you will read it with
[1:00:25] understand
[1:00:27] that is why this morning I've just added
[1:00:30] the you know you can put the one I've
[1:00:32] sent this
[1:00:34] morning there's a cycle around the
[1:00:38] pyramid the cycle of
[1:00:41] Eternity seeing our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:44] being the character from the foundation
[1:00:47] of the
[1:00:49] world to the foundation of the
[1:00:52] world it goes
[1:00:54] around without initial
[1:00:58] Point amen and us being part of
[1:01:02] him because our souls has got no time to
[1:01:08] start has got no time to end we are
[1:01:12] Eternal
[1:01:14] beings amen amen so when you look at the
[1:01:18] Garden of Eden it's not the beginning of
[1:01:22] things it's just the beginning of
[1:01:24] creation
[1:01:26] right in the garden of here on Earth but
[1:01:30] there were
[1:01:31] millions billions yes that God was there
[1:01:37] before even Eden
[1:01:40] was so you never started the life in the
[1:01:43] Garden of
[1:01:44] Eden you started the life in God if God
[1:01:50] was
[1:01:51] eternal you are
[1:01:54] Eternal so God was just showing
[1:01:58] us how this drama he can
[1:02:01] play
[1:02:03] from back to
[1:02:06] Eternity amen amen let's read the book
[1:02:09] of uh First
[1:02:12] Corinthians chapter
[1:02:15] 15 First Corinthians chapter 15 we will
[1:02:18] read uh verse 45 until 47 from verse 45
[1:02:23] to verse 47
[1:02:25] and so it is written the first man Adam
[1:02:29] was made a living Soul the last Adam was
[1:02:32] made a quickening spirit how be that was
[1:02:37] not first which is spiritual but that
[1:02:40] which is natural and after what that
[1:02:42] which is spiritual the first man is of
[1:02:45] the earth e the second man is the Lord
[1:02:48] From
[1:02:50] Heaven amen amen so there was the first
[1:02:54] Adam
[1:02:56] that was a living
[1:02:58] soul and there was a second Adam that
[1:03:02] was the quickening
[1:03:04] spirit so the first ad need the second
[1:03:10] Adam right there in the Garden of Eden
[1:03:13] there was Eve who fell but right at the
[1:03:17] end
[1:03:18] here will be e who
[1:03:23] unfall the second aen
[1:03:26] cannot fall the second if cannot fall
[1:03:32] because these two bring
[1:03:36] Perfection amen amen that is why we
[1:03:41] needed
[1:03:42] brother to explain this
[1:03:45] things right at the you know
[1:03:49] conclusion right at the end of
[1:03:52] everything right there at the resolution
[1:03:56] he will
[1:03:58] conclude but from there on we need to go
[1:04:02] back
[1:04:04] exposition to make a complete
[1:04:07] cycle now for us to go to the you know
[1:04:11] Exposition brother is no longer
[1:04:14] there physically how are we going to
[1:04:17] reach there if we think if we think we
[1:04:22] need
[1:04:23] him amen amen you know our God is a good
[1:04:28] god he was never
[1:04:30] desperate I was reading brother bam was
[1:04:35] telling us there Paul was the first
[1:04:39] messenger and indeed he was but at the
[1:04:43] end of the Minster Ministry of Paul we
[1:04:48] we see
[1:04:49] Timothy being the pastor of the church
[1:04:54] on that day during the time of
[1:04:58] Paul when brother Bram
[1:05:01] come into
[1:05:04] sin he said to us I preached like
[1:05:10] Paul if Paul is in
[1:05:12] heaven I am Heavenly
[1:05:16] power Paul preach I never deviated from
[1:05:20] them and when we read F we realize this
[1:05:25] some of the things that Paul preached he
[1:05:29] was just preaching but brother BR became
[1:05:33] the
[1:05:38] manifestation Paul was saying I saw a
[1:05:41] man in
[1:05:43] Christ but when brother Bram come he
[1:05:47] didn't saw a man in
[1:05:49] Christ he was
[1:05:52] there God gave him an opportunity
[1:05:56] to be not to
[1:05:58] see be why Paul
[1:06:04] so when Paul saw maybe in a vision but
[1:06:09] brother Bram be literally
[1:06:13] there he is the seventh manager
[1:06:16] messenger when Paul come and say the the
[1:06:21] word of God is like a two-edged s
[1:06:26] what he is teaching is how far he can go
[1:06:31] is how God can give him when brother
[1:06:35] come he said that
[1:06:37] s is in my
[1:06:40] hand it was never in the hand of Paul
[1:06:44] God has just Vindicated to
[1:06:47] him this word of God it's like the
[1:06:51] sword to brother is not a vision it's
[1:06:55] not it's not a vision it's not a dream
[1:07:03] literally amen amen then if brother
[1:07:07] Bram like Paul the P to be the same he
[1:07:13] became the
[1:07:15] manifestation and brother Bram
[1:07:18] say you the bride when I'm gone your
[1:07:24] pastor will you
[1:07:26] through I'm going to put it this way
[1:07:29] from the
[1:07:31] resolution to the
[1:07:33] exposition you need your
[1:07:38] pastor because brother
[1:07:40] bred the whole thing and God took him
[1:07:45] you cannot just walk as a loner and
[1:07:49] brother said so you need
[1:07:53] leadership you need Shepherd
[1:07:56] you need someone who can guide you right
[1:08:00] back to the
[1:08:01] beginning the only person that can lead
[1:08:04] you
[1:08:05] there it's your
[1:08:08] pastor
[1:08:09] amen amen amen when you look from the
[1:08:15] exposition towards the
[1:08:17] climax there were brothers and sisters
[1:08:20] that lived the work of God and all their
[1:08:24] characters
[1:08:25] appointing to
[1:08:27] Christ I show it previously that when
[1:08:31] you look at the life of
[1:08:33] David Jesus Christ when you look at life
[1:08:36] of
[1:08:37] Solomon Christ when you look at
[1:08:40] Enoch you look at Abraham when you look
[1:08:44] at Isaiah when you look at the
[1:08:47] prophet one man having all those
[1:08:51] characters our Lord Jesus Christ becomes
[1:08:54] the main character
[1:08:59] Amen in the whole thing then when he he
[1:09:03] moved from the
[1:09:05] climate
[1:09:07] condescending towards the
[1:09:10] conclusion we see he incarnating
[1:09:14] himself in the
[1:09:17] apostles in the disciples in the
[1:09:20] children of God of that time to the
[1:09:24] conclusion and when brother BR come into
[1:09:28] the sea he said to the bride I give you
[1:09:32] the Merit
[1:09:35] certificate the one whom you are looking
[1:09:37] for the bright groom is here with
[1:09:42] you and he stop there your pastor is the
[1:09:47] one that will Asher
[1:09:50] you the Rapture is the part we do not
[1:09:53] want to talk about
[1:09:56] this morning you are
[1:09:58] allergic to the
[1:10:00] pastor put the ear
[1:10:02] PL because now we are in
[1:10:06] between the
[1:10:08] exposition and the
[1:10:10] resolution brother of
[1:10:16] the
[1:10:19] amen the letter
[1:10:22] kill you hold on those letters you don't
[1:10:26] know what God is
[1:10:29] manifesting
[1:10:32] today you will be lost having spoken
[1:10:36] weight because some of the things in the
[1:10:39] spoken we you yourself you omit them
[1:10:44] those that
[1:10:45] omit is the one that will take you
[1:10:50] through brother Bram spoke about the
[1:10:53] leadership
[1:10:55] and
[1:10:56] say a lamp or a sheep when it's lost
[1:11:00] it's
[1:11:01] lost it can't
[1:11:05] help amen
[1:11:07] amen I go to the very
[1:11:10] often and I was wondering but I got the
[1:11:14] answers
[1:11:15] today because here you know when you go
[1:11:18] to the there's many ships there there
[1:11:21] something that I saw if maybe we can
[1:11:24] experience
[1:11:31] but when I get
[1:11:32] to I was with the brothers coming from
[1:11:34] the
[1:11:35] baptism when we go to the
[1:11:39] Village I saw this man he's a
[1:11:43] Shepherd you know this
[1:11:46] man he dressed like Bas as they
[1:11:50] dress
[1:11:52] he and he talked to the animals
[1:11:56] the lamps were the Sheep were there then
[1:11:59] I heard him he was talking fast I
[1:12:02] couldn't
[1:12:06] hear
[1:12:08] ler I saw him turning
[1:12:11] around and going there and all the
[1:12:18] ships when I grew
[1:12:22] up ands
[1:12:26] you
[1:12:28] them you block this
[1:12:31] side come here this side not side this
[1:12:36] way until
[1:12:39] you looking saying this
[1:12:41] ships
[1:12:43] that's go
[1:12:46] to the she they follow
[1:12:52] their amen amen and just a nature of a
[1:12:57] sheep a sheep has made to
[1:13:01] follow not to be in front that means Us
[1:13:06] in we are against the nature but in they
[1:13:12] in nature because they are sheeps follow
[1:13:15] them if you are a sheep this morning you
[1:13:19] can not in being front of your Shepherd
[1:13:23] but you will follow
[1:13:28] amen I saw even their
[1:13:31] cett this other one was having this road
[1:13:35] I was
[1:13:36] observing then he was telling this kle
[1:13:40] you guys must eat here then they come
[1:13:44] and eat there then after some time he
[1:13:48] take the same road and they hit on their
[1:13:52] horns talking talking I don't know what
[1:13:54] he was
[1:13:56] saying and there after they leave and
[1:14:00] follow
[1:14:02] him amen amen I I've seen those when I
[1:14:06] was on the other
[1:14:08] side seeing what God in is doing in
[1:14:13] nature amen amen so between the
[1:14:18] Resolute and the
[1:14:21] exosite is the place of the
[1:14:30] look at the things
[1:14:32] here there at the
[1:14:34] resolution you see
[1:14:37] brother and Bri it was when
[1:14:41] brother was telling you that you go
[1:14:46] forth when you go forth having the med
[1:14:51] certificate having all the sins being
[1:14:53] exposed
[1:14:55] and
[1:14:56] revealed you follow you cannot just
[1:15:00] follow if you are here on Earth we need
[1:15:03] to follow
[1:15:05] someone if you do not follow your pastor
[1:15:09] but
[1:15:10] something is there for you
[1:15:13] to you can't go
[1:15:16] alone can I speak this morning when
[1:15:20] brother BR having the
[1:15:23] s in his and he said when he was opening
[1:15:29] it looking at it at sometimes it just
[1:15:35] vanished to
[1:15:37] where when God started something you
[1:15:41] will end with something it didn't
[1:15:45] vanish going nowhere but
[1:15:50] it in the hand of
[1:15:52] brother right into the heart of your
[1:15:56] pastor for you to follow because the
[1:16:01] sord is the word of God that's what
[1:16:05] says that s is the word of God and if
[1:16:10] the word of God in a
[1:16:13] man other
[1:16:15] men follow when they follow they become
[1:16:21] the they become the beneficiary
[1:16:26] was in another
[1:16:30] men those are the things we om me
[1:16:34] because we think when we mention the
[1:16:38] name
[1:16:40] is uplifting your man and then the next
[1:16:44] thing we don't want to uplift a man then
[1:16:47] the next thing he missed the
[1:16:50] [Applause]
[1:16:52] mar it's easy for me to talk
[1:16:57] you say hallelujah when I say Peter
[1:17:00] glory to God when I say
[1:17:15] Paul amen maybe people like
[1:17:19] myself
[1:17:20] maybe people like myself must say these
[1:17:23] things because others cannot
[1:17:30] say amen amen it's so easy to realize so
[1:17:34] much in
[1:17:39] history pray for me I'm too fast bless
[1:17:43] yes amen help me to relax a little bit
[1:17:50] amen can I start
[1:17:53] slow amen amen
[1:17:56] H it's too
[1:17:58] easy for us to talk about
[1:18:03] history but
[1:18:04] fail to see what God is doing in
[1:18:14] our amen amen because if we talk lies
[1:18:20] amongst
[1:18:21] ourselves we start to think that this

[1:19:43] to
[1:19:51] anything amen amen is what is happening
[1:19:54] this
[1:19:55] now I want to tell you this
[1:19:56] morning
[1:19:58] resolution and
[1:20:00] Exposition it's you and your pastor the
[1:20:04] one that is
[1:20:06] responsible you into
[1:20:09] the and that says the
[1:20:17] prophet testimony is a spoken with
[1:20:21] spoken brother Bram brother Bram when he
[1:20:24] talk he's pointing you because he knows
[1:20:30] we are in a journey he's pointing you
[1:20:33] somewhere always when you read the
[1:20:36] spoken read it again listen to
[1:20:42] this
[1:20:44] testimony testimony it's just
[1:20:48] exactly like Christ and the
[1:20:51] church when Christ had gone
[1:20:54] away from this
[1:20:56] Earth he shines
[1:20:59] back his power on the church which
[1:21:05] reflect his life who's reflecting
[1:21:09] Christ's life this
[1:21:13] morning no you love
[1:21:16] history maybe it's them during the time
[1:21:20] of brother BR but if you say us
[1:21:24] definitely
[1:21:25] us get the revelation of
[1:21:28] us
[1:21:35] today that's just like bride and the
[1:21:37] bride
[1:21:39] gr the whole book
[1:21:42] ofis the whole Bible
[1:21:47] types types
[1:21:49] out and is tied to Jesus Christ
[1:21:56] when you look at those
[1:21:58] characters they all go
[1:22:01] up Jesus Christ so now you start to
[1:22:05] realize that the Tree of
[1:22:08] Life In the Garden of Eden was the Lord
[1:22:12] Jesus
[1:22:13] Christ he started the journey
[1:22:17] himself when Moses was
[1:22:20] talking was Christ
[1:22:23] talking David rule
[1:22:26] Israel God ruling
[1:22:29] Israel when Solomon rulle
[1:22:32] Israel was Christ ruling
[1:22:35] is character is taking up to the
[1:22:41] day Jesus Christ Jesus was
[1:22:46] born amen amen now we started to see
[1:22:51] that all the Old Testament
[1:22:57] men of God were reflecting
[1:23:00] him up there he's the main character he
[1:23:07] the amen amen then from there
[1:23:11] on he comes down and when he comes down
[1:23:16] when they were sitting at the upper room
[1:23:20] 120 of them it was him
[1:23:26] himself among
[1:23:28] them Peter and Paul didn't know each
[1:23:32] other but the day they come together
[1:23:37] they realize that they speak the same
[1:23:41] language Peter met Jesus face to
[1:23:46] face with him fishing with him
[1:23:51] everything with him he even saw him
[1:23:54] racing in the
[1:23:55] days healing the sea that was Peter but
[1:23:59] Paul was not there but the day Paul met
[1:24:05] Peter they spoke the
[1:24:08] same because Paul met Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:13] when he was on the way to Damascus when
[1:24:17] that
[1:24:18] light him he realized that this is my la
[1:24:24] when they meet they spoke the
[1:24:28] same and they sat down and agreed when I
[1:24:33] go this way you go that way and then one
[1:24:36] of the days we meet and give
[1:24:41] feed they supported one
[1:24:44] another not support touching
[1:24:50] one
[1:24:52] amen we touch one
[1:24:56] another because we want the
[1:25:03] glory who said this who said what why is
[1:25:07] not me why is not me it's not you
[1:25:12] because God gave it to this brother or
[1:25:16] this sister to edify
[1:25:18] [Applause]
[1:25:22] the you know where I'm
[1:25:25] working we normally speak about the
[1:25:28] common
[1:25:33] goal we have what
[1:25:36] can

[1:26:39] driver
[1:26:42] H will you make
[1:26:45] it God is a god of
[1:26:50] specialist
[1:26:52] specialist when you are born
[1:26:55] you had a special gift that you receive
[1:26:58] from God to edify his church but most of
[1:27:03] the people leave what God called them
[1:27:08] for start to be
[1:27:11] something that's where you miss the
[1:27:15] mar we need to support
[1:27:19] one notouch one

[1:37:46] you cannot
[1:37:48] differentiate between God and a

[1:37:58] sustained if we were not to be
[1:38:01] sustained if you were not be able to
[1:38:05] beain you can just pick your
[1:38:08] Bible pick your spoken with yourself
[1:38:12] maybe your family worship in the house

[1:39:58] believed in
[1:40:01] sear it needed a
[1:40:04] Shepherd into pieces because it's

[1:46:09] negative was
[1:46:12] trying all right the second one you were
[1:46:15] saying this
[1:46:23] that Spirit was from the
[1:46:25] devil because the devil was working
[1:46:30] here writing
[1:46:32] negatives about the children of God

[1:47:37] children of
[1:47:48] God you just say I've heard until one of
[1:47:53] the people says I came to a point
[1:47:55] whereby even if you can tell me that you
[1:47:59] know the fish can climb up the
[1:48:06] tree other people they just like to
[1:48:09] start
[1:48:16] unnecessary that's what God told the
[1:48:21] devil list this oh no it's fine what I
[1:48:23] see here through the blood and the blood
[1:48:28] the theop of the person
[1:48:37] behold that time he was allowed this
[1:48:41] time God
[1:48:44] responds what he
[1:48:47] SE if you are theop you hold his face
[1:48:53] to will never listen
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:48:59] to so you don't have to worry
[1:49:05] anymore I was telling the people that
[1:49:08] I'm not scared of
[1:49:10] death because you scared of death at the
[1:49:14] end when rapture chish
[1:49:25] are coming with the and
[1:49:31] then so why should you be scared
[1:49:35] of don't be scared you know why you
[1:49:38] don't have a right to be
[1:49:40] scared complete
[1:49:43] job has been
[1:49:46] done those that will be in the
[1:49:49] Rapture God knows the number
[1:49:52] that will go before
[1:49:54] the God knows the number why are you
[1:50:03] scared amen amen the Feast of the
[1:50:05] trumpet spoken with
[1:50:08] amen then the bride will come to be with
[1:50:11] the
[1:50:13] bridegroom and the bridegroom with the
[1:50:17] bride and then the great millennium
[1:50:22] the whole
[1:50:24] world is destroyed by the atomic
[1:50:28] power and there will be a new
[1:50:31] Heaven
[1:50:33] new live together don't be scared I
[1:50:37] normally tell the
[1:50:39] people in life just
[1:50:42] relax if you can relax and be the
[1:50:48] mechanics let God be the Dynamics
[1:50:53] done all you don't have to worry because
[1:50:57] the one that holds the
[1:51:00] fut there in
[1:51:05] you amen amen so you no longer worry
[1:51:08] about the things of the
[1:51:10] world I'm saying
[1:51:13] this our pastor is there
[1:51:16] streaming is influencing this
[1:51:20] mystery as he is staining
[1:51:24] us to the
[1:51:28] [Music]
[1:51:32] exposition amen
[1:51:44] amen is a good
[1:51:48] man this
[1:51:50] person but if you say to
[1:51:54] said let me make a coffee for your
[1:51:58] brother you
[1:52:03] really but don't talk nice about other
[1:52:05] people to that particular person this
[1:52:07] toxic kind of a
[1:52:10] amen amen amen the Masterpiece
[1:52:14] Masterpiece notice the bride if the
[1:52:18] bride in the beginning was the weight
[1:52:23] I love this
[1:52:25] quote if it was the W or the
[1:52:30] bridegroom let me stud it again if the
[1:52:34] bright in the beginning was the way or
[1:52:38] the
[1:52:39] bridegroom and then if the bride is
[1:52:43] taken from the
[1:52:45] bridegroom it must be the word
[1:52:49] also if is there is capital dou
[1:52:55] you notice the bride must
[1:53:01] be if the
[1:53:03] groom is the weight the bride is the
[1:53:07] weight as
[1:53:09] well because you cannot
[1:53:13] separate the bride from the group there
[1:53:17] are no longer
[1:53:19] 12 but
[1:53:20] one we are staining ourself
[1:53:25] such when you have built your
[1:53:29] company when you have built it the way
[1:53:32] you want it what you need is
[1:53:37] sustainability that's
[1:53:40] all when you started it's a
[1:53:44] project it's a
[1:53:47] development this and there
[1:53:50] the everything is in
[1:53:53] we just need to sustain
[1:53:55] that let's sustain
[1:53:59] ourself amen amen why must the
[1:54:03] bridegroom be the weight
[1:54:08] manifest made
[1:54:11] plain is because the bright and the
[1:54:16] bright groom are one she is just a
[1:54:20] smiting piece of
[1:54:26] there is the
[1:54:28] Masterpiece It Was
[1:54:32] Written when the word is
[1:54:34] written somewhere somehow needs to be
[1:54:41] manifested we are living in the
[1:54:46] manifestation of the word of God it was
[1:54:50] written as the Bible here
[1:54:53] It Was Written in the spoken word but we
[1:54:57] need to be the
[1:54:59] manifestation what the Bible was talking
[1:55:02] about is us what brother was
[1:55:06] talking is us when you find a company
[1:55:11] now being
[1:55:14] built no one can penetrate when you find
[1:55:19] a church that has been built from the
[1:55:23] foundation of the
[1:55:26] Apostle you can send the most you know
[1:55:30] evil
[1:55:32] preacher

[1:55:45] scared you guys you must be strong you
[1:55:49] must be together you must look out there
[1:55:51] you must you no longer saying this you

[1:56:01] the coming of the Lord where you look
[1:56:05] you go there no one can deceive you you
[1:56:10] know your St once you know your position
[1:56:14] in Christ no one can deceive you if they
[1:56:19] deceive you you are not in your right
[1:56:22] [Applause]
[1:56:27] amen amen you know Jesus Christ he was
[1:56:31] teaching
[1:56:32] them all the Mysteries but one of the
[1:56:36] days when they were together he look at
[1:56:39] Peter and say Peter the day you you are
[1:56:46] transformed strengthen your
[1:56:49] brethren leave it there amen he knows
[1:56:52] that day will come and that Day Has
[1:56:57] Come Peter that used to
[1:57:01] lie Peter that used to cut somebody's
[1:57:05] ear was a transformed
[1:57:10] Peter he was even given the keys of
[1:57:14] heaven amen am you can no longer deceive
[1:57:21] Peter he was
[1:57:23] transformed he even stood there and said
[1:57:27] if you you want to kill me pfy me like
[1:57:31] my Lord must turn my cross up down for
[1:57:36] the respect of
[1:57:40] [Applause]
[1:57:44] him Steven was
[1:57:47] stoned and St was a Deon in the church
[1:57:54] when they Stone him he said Lord
[1:58:01] forgive amen amen he did not worry
[1:58:06] anymore about what the flesh the world
[1:58:11] has because he saw heaven
[1:58:14] open if you can see Heaven
[1:58:17] open you no longer worry about the
[1:58:20] things of the world we worry about the
[1:58:23] things of the world because we haven't
[1:58:25] seen ourself in Christ if we see ourself
[1:58:28] in
[1:58:30] Christ
[1:58:31] everything that you
[1:58:33] see say with a naked eye they are
[1:58:39] temporal if you can see your body the
[1:58:42] one you boost about is temporal one of
[1:58:46] the days will go away belong
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:58:53] am you do not
[1:58:56] have to to boast about what you
[1:59:02] have there was a king who boasted about
[1:59:06] what he
[1:59:07] had all what the world
[1:59:10] know the moment he want to enjoy
[1:59:14] himself was the end
[1:59:19] of amen amen so when while sustaining
[1:59:26] ourselves let's go up there my last
[1:59:30] quote from the church age
[1:59:33] [Music]
[1:59:35] book the
[1:59:36] bride goes
[1:59:39] wherever the bridegroom
[1:59:43] is where he leads
[1:59:47] me the people do not want to be
[1:59:51] followers
[1:59:53] but they want to be
[1:59:55] followed the devil did not want to
[1:59:58] follow go to follow
[2:00:00] God but he's got many
[2:00:05] followers she will never let by she will
[2:00:10] never be left by
[2:00:17] him okay she will never leave his sight
[2:00:26] she will share the throne with
[2:00:31] him she will be crowned with his glory
[2:00:35] and
[2:00:40] honor I'm
[2:00:42] sorry the business
[2:00:45] people normally they do this thing of
[2:00:49] out of property in out
[2:00:55] of their bus
[2:01:00] sake but here in the word of God I'm not
[2:01:04] saying about you but here in the word of
[2:01:06] God meaning Christ in the
[2:01:09] church and the
[2:01:12] bride only one thing in community of
[2:01:15] prop
[2:01:22] ours who we are is
[2:01:26] his we share the
[2:01:28] throne
[2:01:30] with amen amen so the only
[2:01:35] access that we need to enter in the
[2:01:39] Garden of
[2:01:41] Eden where the sword is
[2:01:43] Flaming is blocking the way
[2:01:47] to is when you stay with your pastor
[2:01:52] he will teach you amen he will guide you
[2:01:56] he will embrace you he doesn't have
[2:01:59] jealous if you want a business he will
[2:02:02] pray for you to get that business get
[2:02:06] that job and when you get it you can
[2:02:10] back slide doesn't matter but his duty
[2:02:14] was to make sure you what is true for
[2:02:18] you a specialist
[2:02:22] the one who stood among the
[2:02:26] Israelites amen amen and then he was
[2:02:29] just praying for them you know we Sim
[2:02:32] you are there you you are there you know
[2:02:36] you Judah you are there amen but he was
[2:02:39] just ushering the blessing
[2:02:41] today a specialist
[2:02:44] job and I like it
[2:02:47] when
[2:02:49] today we will say you are a
[2:02:54] Christian if you haven't reached that
[2:02:56] spot you still in a journey but the day
[2:03:01] we say you are a real Christian is when
[2:03:05] you live
[2:03:06] yourself and live for
[2:03:10] others that's what say you live to
[2:03:14] others because your duty as a Christian
[2:03:18] is to do nothing but to impact
[2:03:23] life you are a Living
[2:03:26] Sacrifice you show the world who you
[2:03:32] are
[2:03:34] is live for

[2:03:43] give
[2:03:44] someone 10 when he
[2:03:47] needs can I tell you something that 10
[2:03:53] disappear because you supposed to to
[2:03:56] help somebody then
[2:04:02] you I will be looking for that was
[2:04:05] showing you help others because I helped
[2:04:10] you God bless you

[2:07:20] elders
[2:07:23] we are going to invite
[2:07:26] dad to say a word of
[2:07:29] prayer God bless you amen
[2:07:41] [Music]
[2:07:52] I still remember one
[2:07:55] day when we were talking to the Pastor
[2:07:59] said there's the angel of the Lord in
[2:08:01] the Pulpit amen many people didn't
[2:08:05] understand
[2:08:06] that
[2:08:09] [Music]
[2:08:11] so has G
[2:08:14] us a light so that we can see there's no
[2:08:18] man can speak like this with without the
[2:08:22] angel of the
[2:08:23] Lord take the
[2:08:25] control there's
[2:08:28] Authority there is
[2:08:30] power we thank the message Father God
[2:08:33] because it
[2:08:35] shows what it comes from the Hallelujah
[2:08:39] dear Lord we have
[2:08:40] prayed said we are going to the sav
[2:08:44] please speak to
[2:08:48] us one day I still remember the Pastor
[2:08:51] said
[2:08:53] some people they can ask something to
[2:08:55] God when God bring that thing and they
[2:08:59] get
[2:09:00] surprise
[2:09:02] because they don't know what they are
[2:09:04] asking so dear Lord this is what we've
[2:09:07] been asking speak to us and you did
[2:09:10] speak to
[2:09:12] us and you just told us who is the
[2:09:15] pastor amongst
[2:09:17] us amen father God I still remember
[2:09:21] the story of a rich man and a poor man
[2:09:25] yes the rich man saw
[2:09:28] Abraham and saw Lazarus in the bosom of
[2:09:33] Abraham and said Father Abraham send
[2:09:37] Lazarus to
[2:09:39] us and dear Lord when we look at that
[2:09:45] scripture according to the scripture was
[2:09:47] supposed to be God or it were supposed
[2:09:50] to be Jesus
[2:09:52] J but that rich man didn't see God
[2:09:56] didn't see Jesus he saw
[2:09:59] Abraham the man who was on the
[2:10:04] earth because the when the Bible said
[2:10:06] greater is he that is in us than the one
[2:10:09] who is in the
[2:10:11] world that shows us you've been
[2:10:15] transform
[2:10:16] yourself into the body of a
[2:10:18] man father God whether the devil like it
[2:10:22] or not it will stays like
[2:10:25] that because you speak through men
