Description:
Title: The Threefold Revelation of God III

This message was preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 01-01-2023

During this sermon, he reads John 14: 20 - 23.  "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. 21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. 22 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him". The primary purpose of this sermon is to teach the community about their position and part in the Threefold according to John 14. That, the third part of verse 20 saying, "I in you." The community needs to have the knowledge that He is in us. What God does is directed to these Threefold (I am in the father, and ye in me, and I in you), and these three are one. He further encourages the audience that in every situation we face, God has already prepared that place to obey His word. When the children of Israel were coming to cross the red sea, God had already spoken to the Red Sea. And the sea believed Moses as it has believed God. And in every path we take, God has already converted that path.

something here too I don't are you ready for that yes oh yes um you know I am still there that's why you say I I I'm looking yes the but the first thing that represented that Redemption is because even this message is from the back side of the book so and then uh he took the book achiabuka let us put it first then yes my brother so we are is God to make things easier for us [Music] oh yeah brother just point to the first part the yeah I will read I will read this part just I think yeah I wanna can you see it the first thing we presented that the Redemption that represented it since cbse image come the lamp that had been slain from the foundation of the world all of us that's the plan of God from before the foundation of the world of us foreign that's why the Angels stop everything is the service was coming down services I mean to men if that's why we read the scripture what is men yes in the book we read there was no man who was named to till the ground that is Genesis chapter one there you are there was no man who was named to till meaning that in the program of God in the program of God there must be foreign now I was not surprised when things were sent to the Earth to to that demand oh all right then it says I will start from here and tour of the sealsuto and sent it down to The Air I remember now actually we are where is our church where is our child Brew here it is that's right I mean and but if you look at it leveling how it operates on from Heaven downwards then it puts you in the threefold your local this is what I'm looking at here yes but to the seventh angels to reveal it to his people [Music] if there is a major style food and and it brings forth its light it relates to the cluster that's right I mean the Stars around the United States now you must make sure because from like Paul was that style the first church cluster there the main star was available all right I mean as it's something to do with us yes they just want me to me too all right all right yeah okay have you seen that Labon every pasta is a star yes and the cluster is receiving from the main stars uh my brother here last night because we we don't sleep we are waiting for the Lord I mean I mean he said something to me um [Music] like how can I be like you or foreign well okay I mean then we we we I went on to say that's why if you are there when Paul was here you just be like a Paul oh no because God Paul is the light there and this little stars around you know they are receiving their light from the main light yeah amen amen so they are just going to testify to their people about what they have received from the ministers amen so they are just like that main star do not finally all right so make sure perceiving your light from the light it is light from the light yes okay and that's why he says he he is and he said that the light said to us foreign amen amen so that's how it is and they and brother gave us a testimony or for a sister we are maybe he will give it to us actually maybe there's something you have missed when the testimony was coming forth of that child in hospital and you know brother music said something that there is a man who said worrying I should go and get that Sun boy where he is I I don't know if I'm reflecting very well yes did you say that brother well give the brother Mike here now now we are in the service now yes here we don't say I can't say take it to leave it because all right see it that is spread forth we shall shine you know God knows God don't need to say take it or leave it his weight has got a place if the world don't take it easy around him the way it is the place of the world what did he say brother now uh fear not to help the brother there for the mic to the scholarship say it aloud amen he said to me ask the Ancient of Days I mean okay and you know brother it was nothing for the first time at home he has said such things even before well he is only known to me again there's some other things he has said he is the man who gave it to me yeah the ancient of this is and I know what he means we we were watching with you brother remember I asked him to get me the quotations on zodiac I preached on that many years ago so I just wanted the quotations then I said to him you know ever since when I was still a boy I used to sit because on the stoop of our house do you say stupid in English and I would take a chance sit down and look up teachers and I see some Stars moving yeah like some lines I mean or the age the Stars will be giving out their life but I would see some lines yes like that and with the Stars remaining stationery what is that then I'll go around looking for the old books I remember I was searching for a book about the Greek mythology all these things just like winding back that's why now you you also here Lily NAFA [Music] because I was this morning reading something is talking about the back side of the book I mean and so it is like there's something in you winding backwards and you just you don't receive it away I'm already from here today this means this mystery started back there amen now the only way you can get it easy okay if you started then brother Brandon calls it the back side of the book because the book God was written yes no now this ministry now would you ready for the the the souls for me boy yeah that are to be Rapture is from the back side amen amen now that's why you'll give off the model mystery because you are from the back side okay now here we are it is the backside people who will bring the backside Ministries and let's reach few things now it says after he opened the book tour of the seals it down to the Earth from heaven Israel but it will come to Heaven and Earth also because if you go to your Bible um it puts you in a place where Heaven and Earth were once together the Bible will prove to you Bible proven When Heaven and Earth will be together at the end all right Amen brother I don't want anyone to doubt okay yeah you know where you are going I mean Revelation 21 Revelation 21 verse 1. and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away right because everything that was created has an end has an inner level faith amen amen now it seems like God God when he's he was creating things below or lady he was creating them for a period foreign [Music] are failing and now the city that we see even now hello and so uh it is like myself yourself your body how your body is The Works of this person will show you that he is and put in there and eternal beings from the senses he won't be controlled amen because the body if you are not Eternal Body can control you amen amen and that's why if my body is nothing and for for to carry the Eternal people wanted to put on fishes [Music] [Music] to be like Jesus [Music] all I know it seems to be like amen then if all you want is to be like you will live like him oh let me let me finishing and close Italian and send it down I remember first to the Earth all the fasting amen amen god with him can't keep it in heaven because government he has owner call you he has what attributes yeah he has a partner God calls him what part of the contract [Music] God will do nothing complete the sentence God will do nothing unless unless you find the man I'm a man amen there's people the way God Souls then he would do nothing but he will reveal to Jeremiah so by revealing to Jeremiah he is speaking to his people but it is to come through Jeremiah Isaiah foreign profit amen he is talking to some people behold Borna and these people hear him behold I will send to Elijah we will expect Elijah because they have heard himself I will send you Elijah amen so that's why whether some other spirits will condemn that Elijah ultimators you know there is another God who has fallen all right now the Fallen one well has always something against amen amen you know I I was reading when he says to uh the one who succeeded Moses ah Joshua Joshua uh this is Joshua Joshua my servant Moses is dead read it brother just read Joshua chapter one I'll tell you something Joshua chapter one now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of noon Moses Minister saying Moses my seventh is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all these people unto the land which I do give unto them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the heaters and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any men be able to stand before they all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with them amen Joshua was listening amen amen you know a child of God when God speaks he will remaining amen I mean and then if my father here that this sense his boy to the show arumila hey John is my son I want you to get me something from the show yeah stand still and listen I am a athlete okay father I'm here Chinese I want you to go and buy me one join us to take that message and if perhaps the father sends him somewhere saying go to uh so Mr so and so tell him I your father none that I've sent you [Music] and for to tell him one two Janice will carry that message it is the message from the father and he will go and meet Mr Swinson and he will make sure that alternative he's gonna tell Mr Soso exactly what the father has [Music] if you hear the word of God like foreign there is some other people or so forth available meaning but I'm not talking about the people and who will come and say uh that man that Prophet is this and this and this yeah if I am predestinated I have already heard God has already told me he will send me Elijah any other thing coming after that for me okay I have already God has already spoken if somebody comes after them I mean I'm in I mean you know that yes sir Moses Moshe God gives him the words uh take them acrossidi and yes whether they see is contrary or whatever God reminds Moses tell the people to go forward meaning God has spoken has listened to God now if you are a Believer you know that the sea has believed amen all right amen no if God puts you on a path that part is a Believer because he can say the word of God and he became the garden of Egypt so everything that God foreign that's why now it's a wave you know I always I carry around with me that way and I say you are true God although there are things coming from Elizabeth [Music] God said so Joshua must take the word of God and carry on actually Pete amen amen because the weight said you believe God he says all right okay let's let's look at this Army I'm saying something here uh now he sent it to his servant I remember to reveal it to his people you know that's why the Sea Lord believed Moses amen amen amen if God says Amen to you like God sent Moses to the Sea family the first thing is to convince the sin my Prophet is coming this way and the Sea saw them Jordan the sea they were convicted yeah they were converted God has spoken to the seeds when Moses comes so the sea was waiting for Moses amen for God has spoken to Jesus don't worry the path that is always when you do things when I was attacked I'm not talking about that to me when I was attacked and then I said to myself people with guns has never told us I will go this way out [Applause] so amidst all that I remain calm because knowing that it's about God has never told me that I will go this way all right I mean if God tells you he will take you up in the Rapture he will tell you amen if you are going in the Rapture you will know him that's why he said that day you shall the people that are going in there we know the promise foreign foreign I'm in shall I reach now he sent down to the Earth to his seven well I remember to reveal it to his if you are also of God oh [Music] to his people people Revelation could [Music] if maybe he has said it in this way aroma to talk to his people but it's not to talk to his people to reveala to his people to reveal is to make known to his people but you know there's something like this is [Music] there was one subject that really gave me headaches once the

language foreign you know whatever we're talking with the brothers let me look at my time even yesterday [Music] that or I I respected a sister she came to me and said ah there's a foreign [Music]

be successful although I can't choose for you uh God will guide you already what you have said to me already that's your guidelines I can't marry a person who is against my shepherd I mean amen amen [Music] Hallelujah all right amen this person she is not looking at the man I said whether he's a rich man or a human love family is looking at the word of God she wants to live for God we heard them in the Bible everywhere we help them and I respected the sister but she was not there only one who came to me yes I said carry on follow the lord you'll find your husband I'm in you don't marry you are in need of it has you married because God has given you a husband you're married because God has given you a wife now to your comfort much ah if the wife you have him maybe she's not a good one okay she he said R don't worry I'll skip a line you'll get the right one location all right amen now I didn't ask questions no but he says if he doesn't say my name all right now you find a man says to wearing my wife is this before I could answer him she said I just mean that you pray for me to carry on with my family foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] where are we starting he he he sent it down to the down I remember to his seventh um to reveal it to his people all right um it won't fall in the wrong hands no congregation puter greatly rejoices there you are amen [Applause] he didn't say congregation Rejoice he only said oh really it is coming from him down to the seventh Angels he never even said down to me down and the congregation amen amen without even conducting it I started to Rejoice of the Clusters really he he sent it down to the Earth three seven angels that is foreign [Music] [Applause] amen hallelujah the way it has come down to the master Stars you see I mean meaning all this all this time now these people are looking to the master staff availability they know everything that is [Music] they are waiting for that to happen they start Rejoice because that Supernatural nature that has come down and it is now it is they were in one neighborly and then the power the glory the manifestation congregation Grace now let's come to this now we have yeah let's let's go through this part now we we have read this timing again that uh from the power of transformation to a more powerful transformation he began to bring upon the earth a traumatic teacher [Music] to something and the natural pelosis in his own image you know if that is his image he's got it to send the very same divine nature into his image for the image Supernatural nature comes into the image amen amen that's right the Rapture he's not coming to take you by the hands only that divine nature of which right now now uh all over the world there are some people a brother was testified to somebody that the Lord Jesus was we know but you people are too forward some of us we are not even married amen the brother said the Bible says he was coming the Bible he says but don't go so fast some of us are still looking forward to getting married so now if it comes before we leave he was waiting for the marriage before the rapture we imagine all right amen now the Bible says great all these other things but the Bible said find the first the kingdom all these other things but find first human appeal the kingdom when you are in the Kingdom then you are a child of God in the Kingdom now the marriage will happen first the human ability and all these other things it never said find the money first the kingdom move then the kingdom will take care of the people of the Kingdom amen now this I have read this almost every day when he arrives at the men yeah what did he do he stopped I am when he arrived at the seventh here when it arrived there even the angels stopped I am why it arrives yes I say the Bible says Bible here there was no man who was numbered to till [Music] meaning they were supposed to be a man all right I mean there was no man who was number to open their seals it was supposed to be amen amen Adam Adam was the god of the Earth and God the god of the universe God send to Adam things pertaining pertaining to the things below the Earth sent things to the Earth then he is God respected the god of the earth amen he never even said to Adam this one is in respect of the god of the earth he he brings it to Adam for Adam or Adam to see what Adam would say if Adam say well this one is alive the god of the universe amen amen it is within your powers I mean so that's how he did it that's why even today before it can work for me it has to come to the seventh Engineers all right if it can work for the seventh engine message it will work late night time he's a human being I am a human but God has to put it to test first he has made this man a prophet a prophet means it is God formed in the form of a man it is God in the form of a man now if it comes to this woman so it will pass on to me amen I mean or you can say I am I I am blessed because God likened me unto the seventh angel message was actually sent to me that's why he says so shall I be with you and brother says and the people also said we shall only here is he was with Moses [Applause] amen amen even today we are saying the same thing yeah pastor muruti we will hear you only is God is with you as he was with Moses yes that's right amen that's why would be a soul with him he won't see anything unless he visits first before I say something I check with brother brother what do you say what what did God says but I come I come after that God shall do nothing he reveals To His prophets that's why I take it from the prophets oh God how do I know he is God's Prophet it is because of the nature the divine nature that is all right I mean the reason I left the message amen amen when I remember what the Lord has done I will never go back anymore hey you know in this ministry There's No Going Back amen there's no turning back once a child of God always a child of God no I I would lose with this one like a sofa um I think as I was yeah let me check it here with you Christ Christ there was three full peoples all right I'm getting this at the 70s now do you notice on the opening of The Seven foreign [Music] so he Reveals His Church going back to last weekend the church is revealed right I mean and we don't form a church our family in opposition to somebody it's himself who builds his church [Music] you know sometimes we say yeah I will start another movement in opposition to this world all right yeah like a brother who said now we have a church when a brother was ordained now with this brother we have a church all right but I was glad that you look at times the Lord Jesus said I [Music] Upon This Rock and the gates of Freddy's amen amen don't become a church in Pretoria you are a member of this body [Music] a church born of God not in Pretoria but in Christ because if you become a church then next time you'll be fighting a church in whatever somewhere else that's why I told them in my life churches in the message and we don't have the bride of Christ [Music] the bride of Christ is that right if I meet a brother memes memes yes it means his way in Alabama he is not a church the bright Church we will meet I know him I'll meet him so when we meet we will meet here in Christ then you will realize that we have known one another before the foundation one of us my books are you know books my books are books yeah let me read you something here where's my book brother don't worry don't worry foreign my book okay I will read you this part I started back there with this book A friend of mine yes amen amen I read I tip I'm taking you back to this do you notice on on this opening of this series it's also in a three-fold and I think we have come to terms with that yeah what what is right I mean if you go back here well I'm around yes free food logos logos foreign remote if God says something it will reflected in this three forms I am in my father and you and ye in me and I am I in you in you and when the word of God comes it comes later in these three forms so because the church here is part of the threefolds the bride of Christ part of the threefolds the father that's why it says Hey brother today let us be let them Rejoice amen how God considers even the son don't know because Jesus Christ the original song now Jesus foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] all right I mean closing I can say now I know I mean what about you we're now carrying now I know uh did you see that brother we have read it the other day and I hear this this Patriot says page 65.65 Christ is dead foreign all right now we are closing the service service we are individuals his presence with a personal Vindication do you understand the word personal yeah a Vindication of himself until official for he said he will write his laws where in their hearts so that no the other one shall not say to the other one who is God where is it revealed there's a day when each and everywhere amen I shall write my laws they were understood and they couldn't keep them I will put them inside you know that's why the people they can read and so forth and still go wrong yes it is [Music] a great thing I will write of my people our tobacco do you know that scripture Hebrews Hebrews you don't know Hebrews come brother Hebrews yeah Oh I thought you knew foreign God bless you this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days said the Lord I will put my laws into their head hearts and in their minds will I write them but then and there are signs that sorry and there are sins and iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of this is there is no more offering for sin when they are put inside I shall remember okay amen now somebody can read the spoken right now and he reads something that will hit a heart at his nature is that you ask him are you the message do you believe everything that you read okay I will put my laws foreign [Music] foreign with a personal Vindication of himself now we are it doesn't say of his Spirit you know no there came the Holy Ghost upon them but this time [Music] the anointing coach is himself amen I hope somebody way to talk and that day he never said you shall know that the Holy Ghost is in you but at that day we shall know yes sir he said to them the Holy Ghost shall come upon you that was the Holy Ghost but at the end here it speaks not of the Holy ghosts the mystery of God and at that day in you in you foreign [Music] I mean [Music] he says a great revelation of God only in an individual page 65 Christ the history of God great revelation of God if you can know this is you'll never quarrel with the people because government perhaps what's in you it's not in here an individual never in a group amen yes sir you meet somebody from our assembly yeah people from that church that is not the right way that's an individual if you find one drunk you can't see the brightest drunk okay his identification is he is with an individual I I read you get that like the multiplication says yes yes but as an individual are you are an individuals okay it's not a group it is a personal vindication of a a pregnant child of God immediately with the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he don't care about anything or else and the Holy Spirit living its life showing the personal Vindication the Holy Ghost the word itself expressing itself to the people amen amen oh my amen hey it is full of this Pages here that is this manifestation all right I mean God your creator
