I'm really privileged to stand in front of Heaven to greet [Music] them in the name of our Savior Jesus Christ um we are not going to take a long time um I would like to read the book ofus uh we are going to [Music] read um chapter chapter 9 verse 5 I believe so uh chapter 9 verse yes chapter 9 verse 5 verse 5 chapter 9 verse 5 amen 9 ver 5 for they living know one the not anything neither more want for the memory let's Close Our Eyes Mighty Heavenly Father the father of our Lord Jesus Christ amen let thy name be HED be with us I'm standing here in front of your children I'm together with my brother you know what has happened here we are here to to comfort the children and the family members amen and to comfort the church yes sir I pray be with us yes Lord give us something amen and in the name of the Lord Jesus I pray amen amen you may take your seats I am going to ask for a a watch I'm not going to take you a long time you know [Applause] um we are the children of God and being the children of God when something like this has happen is our time to tell one another uh our hope because living here this place is not our home we have got a home then um my topic is going to be destination of three people of one three people of one oh amen three people of one amen during death ah you may wonder what is happening here um we are going to die the Bible says we know that we are going to die but what do we don't know is when are we going to die but dying we know I also know but I don't know when and another question is that I don't know how I don't know whether I'm going to die through illness or I'm going to die through accident or I'm going to be killed but I'm going to die amen when you are killed that this your time to [Music] die because we cannot stop death no ways we cannot stop death the Bible says there is time to be born and there is time to die that is what God has said and if God has said something like that it will be just like thaten death has got no [Music] reason you cannot say he died because he he he he didn't use medication he use medication and die you cannot say he di because he didn't go he didn't have a medical Aid if he would have Medical Aid you would have gone to better doctors they die there in other words death has no reason some may say he died because he was not training or jiming but I've seen people playing football they pass him ball they gave him the ball they gave him the ball when he tried to drop the ball fell down and dead but he was from a training someone was running a Maron when they were running he fell down and [Applause] died death is no reason amen you cannot say he died because he was old no no no death is no reason death is no age you cannot kill death you cannot stop death the Bible says our days are in his hand he has given us the end of our days and we cannot skip that in other words when your time has come you will die like [Applause] not poor foolish clever wies doctors all will die the Bible says here let me read something here before I go on death has no reason read my brother read Psalm 499 verse 10 to 14 ver 10 14 just read there9 for he said that wise like wise the and the brtish person perish and leave their wealth to others their inward thought is that their houses shall continue forever and their ding places to all generations they call their lands after their own names nevertheless man being in honor abideth not he is like the Beast that perish this their way is their fall yet their posterity approve their are you reading Psalm 49 yes it says um what I want this 19 here he shall go to the generation of his [Music] fathers they shall never see light in other words there are people when they die each and everyone here when he die he goes to his generation if if you are not born again you go to those who are not born again if you are born again you go to those who are born again they say the Bible is talking about those who are not born again he says when they die they go to their [Music] generation and their generation is the generation that don't see amen that is the generation but let me say something here The Bible says in the book of [Music] Corinthians it says um though the inward the outward man perishes amen but the inward man is renewed daily and Paul is talking about two here in one he says there is an inward man there is an outward Man by the in the outside man perishes he gets old and perish that is what has happened here but he says the inward what is renewed daily so that is the reason we need to prepare ourselves then when we go on we read again Paul says the book of Colossians it's talking about putting on an on a new man he says put put away an old man and put on a new man now men m Paul is talking about here when we read the book of Matthew here Jesus says Don't Fear the one who can kill the flesh but who failed to kill the soul you must fear the one who kills the Flesh and the soul [Music] Paul Jesus says there is an outward man and there is an inward man and Jesus called the inward Man soul Paul says talking about the soul says there is an old soul and there is a New Soul he says you put away the old one and put the new one then when I was saying three people in one I was talking about flesh the the old the old soul and the new Soul flesh the old soul and the new soul that is three this all this people they've got their destination and when they go to their destination they go through stations but according to the Bible there is only one man here are you together with me I say there is flesh and old soul and then the new Soul as we are in here some of you they some of you they've got the new but all of us we have got flesh are you together we juster inside because inside some are still wearing the old so some are wearing the new and there is a there is the difference of destination but the flesh got only one destination and his destination is the grave All Flesh the end of it is the gra there is no other place for it is the grave then we have got two here The Old Man and the new man then the new the old man has got two stations the first station station he has got two station after death because after bir you still have to move after death the first the man the old man has got two stations before he reaches his destination are you together with me the first station station is the sixth Dimension The Fifth Dimension the you see we have got the the hates and you have got we have got you see aase is the bottomless [Music] pit even demons fear a because when Jesus was about to drive them away from that that man that man there demon said don't drive us to our base D us into those Peaks because when you go down there are three places there the base is the last it's a bottomless pit The Fifth Dimension dimension which I called the sh because these people who studies the Bible they say the sh is the place where death weigh there for judgment but sometimes they say is GRA but we have got where the de Waits who are not saved and we got the second one is where demons dwell then you have got the third one is Hell before after death after hell bottomless feet that is where the Beast come from that is where devil come from because he has got many names is called Lucifer called called that is the name of Satan when they were saying Jesus was there were many he was Satan because is the king of demons and Satan is the king and we know demons are Fallen Spirits they are the ones who believe Devil's lie in heaven okay they believe the devil's Li they believe the devil's lie in heaven here there are many there are ministers of sat some are liars is a demon is a demon pride is a demon there are many but they they can't work if they don't find a a flesh to work [Music] in this this old man I say his first station is The Fifth Dimension and then the other one the second station this man is the way through judgment the Bible says books were opened and men were judg to what was written in the books when I'm standing here preaching I'm preaching to you I'm preaching to you either you are an old soul now I'm telling you you are destination or after death know that you are going to The Fifth Dimension then from The Fifth Dimension you are going to the W judgment are going to be judged there Bible says the books were open and when people are judged there Sor when people are judged there the Bible says there were some who came there because books were open they came with their good works they say we we were praying for the sick and they go healed we proph Jesus said I don't know you a born man is a new soul the soul which is Born Again is a new soul the soul which is not born again is the because to be born again you are born again through the [Music] seat if you are a New Soul you are a daughter and a son of God and you can be a daughter and a son of God if you are not his SE in other way you were born through his seat my son is my seat and if you are the son of what you are his seat you were his seat from the beginning but through birth you became dirty then the Bible says he forew you before the foundation of the world those who he forew he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son in another always to be the word of God it transforms you from the Son and the daughter of the world to be the Son and the daughter of God you receive the word because the weight is a seat and the seat travels through the body and from the body to the body that's why the seed moved through Philip to the [Music] UN so that birth can be can OCC there but by you are a sinner you should have come at the right place the right way but just because of birth this birth was was in was introduced by Satan here and he he defiled the field because the the wom of a woman is a fi amen then seeds are brought out of that there are bad seat and good seats because from one which is Eve came out a and from one field amen a certain man had a problem of the seed moving through the ark this serent seat he said it moves through the ark through by H I said I said the seat SE seat it can come through a good family just from from Isaac and Rebecca from Isaac re came Esau and Jacob [Applause] and Es was the son of the devil he was the seat of the serpent serpent seat can come from anywhere the Pharisees were the because Jesus said you come from below I come from above he said to them your father is the devil then that is the S seat that is how it comes here it has fallen from Heaven they believe the lie of Satan there they still believing the LIE of Satan we have got many people here they say they believe but only to find that they are not believing the message the way they should believe you must know we have got M Mount camel Showdown and we have got M Transfiguration show down Transfiguration and we still going to have another one the third one is the m Zion Zion show down we are we we all have placed our sacrifices we shall [Applause] see but you know yourself this second this third man because I said I I said the second man the second station is the way through judgment and then where after that he his destination is the Lego of Fire that is his destination you must know your destination then we have got the set man which is the new Soul this that man I said they are Sons and Daughters of God we said they are written in the LMS Book of Life we said They are Kings we said they are the bride we said they are the rulers we said they are Judges that's what the Bible says you cannot take small small cases to the [Music] magistrate why don't you take to the people who are given the PO to judge just like me I'm given the power to judge I am a judge I'm starting here to judge you I'm studing I'm busy judging when I'm preaching your heart tells you where you are when you when you ha them you are you your your name is taken out of the Book of Life The Book of Life is the system of life in other words when you talk about the weight is the system of life then when you say you are in the weight but you hate somebody in the weight then you get out of the way in other words you are no more in the system but when on that day on that day you will say I received a message in 1974 they say yes you are there in the book but your name was removed because of you are hatred you can hear a person in the message saying I I I hate somebody I don't even want to be where he is but saying he is in the message the Bible says if you don't love me as your brother love me as your enemy in other words you don't have the right to hate if you hate you are from the devil in other words you are you are there is a demon the demon which incarnated itself in you you all right are you listening if I'm a pastor like this but I I hate others blessed I will be blessed blessed I will be blessed okay amen blessed I will be blessed but that doesn't mean I am the child of God I can't be the child of God with that little [Applause] hatred but people say but he he's a blessing to us that doesn't mean nothing [Applause] in Matthew chter 25 he said come you the Blessed of my father because I was in the hospital you came and saw me I was sick I I was without clothes you clo with me I was in prison you came and see me he said who have we we didn't see you there he said when you are looking you are doing to this little of my Breen you were doing it unto me hallu in other words when you love this new [Music] Soul you are you are given part in heaven you see here they don't say hey go away because you were a drun you what they don't they don't say go away because you a Dr they say go away because you hated these on when you hate them you you drive yourself away from heaven when you love them you come nearer to Heaven amen their first station station when they when they they die because I believe sister is in this group I say I believe I don't say I don't say he is I don't say she is I say I believe she is because she believed the message when I believe the message I found them [Music] [Applause] there and he even died in the message he even lived the Earth while he was in the message because the message when we say New Birth there is no no bth without a seat and the Bible says those who call upon the name of the Lord they shall be safe amen he said how can they call upon it if they don't know it he said how can how can they preach about it if they are not sent and each and every time God has a man there God has a voice there and those who hear God's voice at the time from that man just like during Moses time those who had Moses they had another Spirit those who didn't have another Spirit they couldn't hear Moses but those who have had him they had God during each AG God had a messenger there and God had predestinated under that Min messenger there were pastors there they were predestinated to be there they are pred to be there under that messenger and there are deons there are sheep there is no sheep without the shepher Sheep without the shepherd is a lost sheep there is no shepher Shepherd is Jesus then when we identify Jesus in a man then we say this one is a Shepherd then the ship will follow the because the voice of God comes from the teaching and the preaching each Messengers has a voice of God that's why the prophet says I am a voice of God to you of to me I am the voice of God to you amen that's why they said before the throne there were voices there those voices were voices of preachers preachers who were under those Messengers those voices they are there judging people I said Those whom he forew he he did predestinate to be conformed to be like his first to be like his first born so that he must have his so those who are new Souls they are his Brethren the Bible says Paul says in Hebrews chapter he says both the stif and those who he sanctifies they are from one person that's why he's not ashamed to call them brethren amen amen how can his Brethren be lost you cannot be lost if you are his to be his God gives you an eye to identify your age to identify your message because the message of your hour that is what is important amen he gives you an eye then you that's why he gave Nathaniel And I so then Daniel said Thou Art the Son of God the king of Israel he had that eye he given that woman an when the phes says you are we are he said thou the prophet he predestinated you he predestinated you to be conformed that that that conforming is in you because each seat in it there is that power that power to to Quicken it because God has placed that power in that seat he said Let each seat produce according to his kind we being the seat we have got that quickening power that quickening power can Quicken us and that quick power is from these way amen the first station their first station after death is the six Dimension because when you go up the you you pass the the first you've pass the Holy Spirit Angels the third is is God then when you go there then you find the children over there under the altar which is the sixth dimension we call it under the altar that the children of God are waiting there from there during Rapture they resurrect when they resurrect they are raptured they go to their second station the second station is made marage that is the station of the new soul that is the station of the bride and you cannot say I am the bride if you don't know when you are married you can say I'm the wife of Pastor when you don't know when did he marry you you must know the date if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you must know when he married you who is the marriage officer and if you don't know ask me but but when you ask me you must say when when were you married you ask me like that don't don't ask me when am I married because I don't know but I know when I am amen yes that is the third station the second station the first one is the sixth Dimension the second one is the mer supper preparing themselves for honeymoon because honeymoon is be the millenni are you together with us there then the the third station it will be the Millennium that is the stations you you must know these things if you are how how can you go there where you don't know this how can you go to a place which you don't know if you don't know it they will give you you will pass this and or pass this and when you pass those places then you say yes yes it they said I will pass this one then I will pass this then I will pass this then I will pass this one then I will my final station I'm telling you your final station I tell your station if you are the new man if you the new Soul you are already in the Rapture amen you are about just just to fly to the to that station amen then from from from Millennium then you go to the fourth and the fourth one is the well thr judgment because only the bride who has got part in the first resurrection others they have got part in the second Resurrection only the bride when you talk about the rapture we talk about the bright because others they don't know what Rapture is how can they be raptured while they don't know it how can you wait for the bus while you don't know what the bus is the bus will pass and will stand there waiting they say what are you waiting W for that big [Applause] [Music] a the prophet says some people will still think where will Rapture come we have heard we have heard say the Rapture will come they will [Applause] say in the way through judgment they are going to be judges they are they going to be judges there are you together with us if you are part of them you're going to be a judge there your life will judge people the way you the way you the way you live is judgment to other people amen you see there are people who don't want to go to church they reasons why today it was raining and I couldn't go through the the prophet said they went through rain went to the church and those people they going to judge you when you say I fail because it was raining they say this one went through the lives of other people are going to judge you you must see how you live when they pay tis you say my money is little I cannot manage my there is a there is somebody who ising Pion [Music] he's paying TI with s he is going to judge you amen all right don't do worry the money is yours you can use the way you want to use it but those who are new Souls those who are children of Abraham they don't need somebody to tell them to pay tax just like their father abrah no one told him he PID ta to amen way through Jud it is their station the fourth one they will be there as judges there then from there they go to the New Jerusalem that is their final destination that is our final destination that is the city Abraham was looking for that is the city our father was looking for the Bible said he thought it was here on Earth but it was not there but we are [Music] of because Paul says you have arrived that is our final destination there will be no see there because Satan won't be there because heer Thea [Music] God bless you know who you are amen know who you are where you are going know who where you come from I
