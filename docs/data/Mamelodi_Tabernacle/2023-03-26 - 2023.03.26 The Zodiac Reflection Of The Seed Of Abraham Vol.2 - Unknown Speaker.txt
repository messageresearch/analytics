the Stars count them reach them foreign for all the land which thou sees today will I give it and provides it forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breath of it for I will give it unto thee amen I love this they learned that Omega foreign Lord foreign Lord has his own and Abraham had his own and now they are Shepherds because this one has this one is that's when in the church and this one is there will be a conflict because there's different Revelations the Lord Jesus is supposed to have one chance now it is it is until you know which one is now his important brother before you reach Genesis stating from verse 5 to 10 yes and not also which went with Abram had flocks and heads and Tents and the land was not able to Bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a Strife between the headmen of Abram's cattle and the headmen of Lord's cattle and the Canaanites and the parasites dwelled there dwelled then in the land and Abraham said unto Lord let there be no Strife I pray thee between me and they and between my head men and thy headmen for we be present amen is not the whole land before you can carry in a bit it's not the whole land before being separate thyself I pray thee from me right amen okay the land could not keep them together but their substance this one had his own substance amen and that caused the conflict until Abraham decided to are you listening Papa and one day the pastor can call for a meeting [Music] all right so that you can say hey there's a hot meeting coming that's when now the emotionally Lord Lord

that from there I'm going to get into them from there Abraham Abraham knew that he would we fully enter the city because what he worked with after a vision you know it was not that much he was going around God would lead him please they separated then after they separate their separation is then God spoke to Abraham [Music] now perhaps maybe while the people were saying things they were saying very like oh even not they left him yeah amen separation is a good thing yeah when it is used to foreign and the best thing is okay amen amen it's not being patients [Applause] don't blow away the smoke get out of there I mean separation all over the Bible separated for a reason good reason tell me but after Abraham separated read it what it says verse 14 chapter 13. and the Lord said unto
