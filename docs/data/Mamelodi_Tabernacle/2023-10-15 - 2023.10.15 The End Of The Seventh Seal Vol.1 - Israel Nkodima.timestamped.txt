[36:49] future because I don't have any future
[36:55] here mhm
[37:03] this banking appears to be a
[37:07] problem where are you going to do
[37:12] now after
[37:15] s your
[37:18] s and then saw that's why he says you
[37:23] are a
[37:25] dispensationalist
[37:31] which I am says brother
[37:34] BR I believe that God is
[37:40] too you've run out of your
[37:45] dispensation
[37:47] [Music]
[37:48] types if you are going to put something
[37:51] beyond that

[37:57] actually it says beyond that seventh
[38:05] day how are you going to get
[38:10] it where are you going to
[38:13] now
[38:15] now the man of God says if you put
[38:20] something beyond that
[38:24] seven if you hit seven
[38:28] then where are you
[38:31] going that's why we have the revelation
[38:34] of the seventh
[38:39] SE amen
[38:42] amen then I'll check for you
[38:45] here uh what he
[38:48] says of this
[38:52] things all right the question
[38:55] stands
[38:57] because he
[38:58] says uh
[39:01] seven deals with
[39:08] the
[39:12] that
[39:14] H was alloted
[39:17] to if now you sp you take
[39:20] seven it says it speaks of the
[39:25] old
[39:28] creation but
[39:31] eight speaks of the
[39:34] new
[39:38] creation you know we have old
[39:44] creation and the
[39:46] new creation that's why the Bible now
[39:50] says to you about the old
[39:54] creation take off
[40:00] take of
[40:03] whom the old man and put on the new
[40:11] man he doesn't say paint the old man or
[40:15] renovate the old
[40:18] man no
[40:24] take and put because the new
[40:28] one comes with its
[40:33] Faith
[40:35] VES everything is
[40:37] new the faith the
[40:40] virtues but the old
[40:43] one you
[40:48] cannot
[40:49] have
[40:51] faith in that old
[40:55] man
[40:57] there's a body that can contain
[41:02] Faith but the old
[41:04] body can't keep
[41:09] Faith amen
[41:12] amen all
[41:14] right when the people maybe after they
[41:18] got some
[41:20] money now they want to renovate their
[41:25] house
[41:26] extend
[41:29] pain did you notice that they also want
[41:33] to change the
[41:38] furniture as God said I make all
[41:46] things he can't give you an old
[41:53] body and put the new furniture in there
[41:59] the new man comes with the new
[42:04] man the old
[42:07] man you can pray and do whatever you do
[42:12] but long the nature is still that
[42:16] one you are going
[42:20] nowhere what must be changed is the
[42:25] nature
[42:26] that's why Peter says he has given us
[42:33] divine nature
[42:35] amen now divine
[42:39] nature uh people are
[42:43] known in this
[42:49] way you can you can be happy with him
[42:52] but be
[42:55] careful
[42:57] now there's somewhere where something
[43:00] not
[43:03] okay when okay but if he can get angry
[43:08] be
[43:10] careful all
[43:13] right the
[43:17] nature of a
[43:19] person it's
[43:21] like I'm
[43:24] tying it's like a person when she is a
[43:27] [Music]
[43:30] witch you've never heard me say so and
[43:32] so is a
[43:34] witch you

[43:40] person he can't even
[43:44] sleep he's
[43:47] busy busy in the business in
[43:55] bu but he is not striving to do a good
[44:01] thing he's not striving to go to
[44:04] heaven but he's busy
[44:08] man when the Sun goes
[44:13] down he's already busy with his
[44:22] broom amen
[44:24] amen because
[44:42] you
[44:43] see
[44:47] now he can come and sit
[44:50] here when you preach he doesn't hear
[44:54] you
[44:56] he is of another
[45:04] nature a person who can hear the word of
[45:07] God is of a strange
[45:12] nature
[45:15] because the B
[45:19] says
[45:21] children have you even
[45:24] seen uh
[45:35] When the Children don't listen to
[45:47] him even if he
[45:50] is even if he the parent is a drun amen
[45:54] amen
[45:58] when the children are not
[46:03] goinging even when he's say my children
[46:05] come
[46:10] here he wants to discipline
[46:13] them and give them order amen even
[46:19] though he cannot
[46:23] stand thing in him is a
[46:27] parent
[46:29] now now he is
[46:33] practicing for his children to do things
[46:37] in
[46:39] order but today's children cell phone
[46:42] they are friends with cell phone okay
[46:46] now
[46:47] let's cross this after seven I
[46:51] now and where are you
[46:58] going now let us pick up some things
[47:03] here from the
[47:06] book
[47:08] firstly I will read to you
[47:11] this the blood
[47:14] test blood test amen
[47:19] amen there's things like
[47:23] this
[47:24] uh
[47:27] sometimes you take anybody be be it a
[47:30] child or a an
[47:36] elder psychologist or
[47:43] psychist you
[47:45] know these ones they work in this they
[47:47] operate they operate in this way if you
[47:52] say this child is doing this and this
[47:54] and that well
[47:57] others they just give them pill amen
[48:01] amen if you say this
[48:03] child amen amen respect no
[48:11] respect they say no no we do give him
[48:13] this headache once
[48:16] but
[48:18] psych you go to a
[48:23] psychiatrist he traces back
[48:27] amen amen so he
[48:34] traces for back there is there no one in
[48:37] the family who was doing
[48:41] this you can say yes the aunt or the
[48:44] uncle was doing this that's the problem
[48:48] [Music]
[48:50] says it comes from
[48:53] there you see amen that's why now if you
[48:56] are a
[48:57] Christian you are you can only be traced
[49:01] back to your
[49:08] the back to
[49:12] God where you came
[49:16] from that's why you are like your
[49:20] father you are doing the same thing
[49:24] because God is your father
[49:28] now you are like your
[49:33] father you Shan everything that is of
[49:36] the
[49:38] world to take his
[49:41] word because his word shall be
[49:45] forever now let me look at
[49:49] this H I'm going to read some few
[49:53] things before
[49:56] uh we can
[49:57] say we have
[50:01] worship
[50:06] okay our
[50:09] day there was this part of
[50:13] seven now after those
[50:16] seven we have read if if I've got the
[50:20] book here otherwise I will just
[50:24] quote you know says is this the
[50:27] time after the seven
[50:32] angels as we I mean seven
[50:39] Messengers and uh brother call them the
[50:44] Earthly
[50:48] Angels because they are Seven
[50:54] Stars mhm M
[50:56] amen now a true
[51:00] worshiper would
[51:05] check that his worship within this seven
[51:10] does it fall under this seven or
[51:14] not if God has given us seven
[51:22] angels we were looking at the one inside
[51:25] there with the
[51:28] brothers the
[51:31] notable
[51:36] Angel which has confused many
[51:40] people right am now I want to look at
[51:46] this the seventh
[51:49] seal the reason they
[51:51] say it is not
[51:54] revealed you'll see it here in the
[51:58] book and yet the
[52:03] seventh when is it going to be
[52:06] revealed if it is not
[52:10] revealed then where are you
[52:14] going okay and again the thing
[52:20] is confusion comes in this way was seven
[52:34] Messengers amen Amen brother B will tell
[52:39] you and we have
[52:43] seven
[52:45] angels from Paul say from
[52:51] eternity now you come from this
[52:54] seven
[52:55] then comes
[52:59] this now you can take seven
[53:04] Messengers amen but it's not complete
[53:08] because after seven there is
[53:15] seven everything comes with the natural
[53:19] the
[53:23] supernatural uh let me find this
[53:27] sometimes
[53:30] uh uh sometimes I I look for some
[53:36] things
[53:37] M all
[53:41] right unless you give me says is this
[53:46] the
[53:48] time page
[53:50] 26 then I will read you something out of
[53:54] there
[53:56] but otherwise while the brother has it
[53:59] he will bring
[54:02] it page
[54:05] 27 I didn't know I would come this way
[54:09] but this page
[54:12] 27 uh 26 26 26 it tells
[54:17] you the prophet was looking right into
[54:23] eternity as he said
[54:27] says you know you don't you won't go to
[54:30] the New
[54:31] Jerusalem
[54:33] unless you have seen
[54:36] it I'll tell you
[54:40] something everything comes like
[54:43] this before you see
[54:47] something uh you've got to see
[54:51] it it comes in forms different form
[54:57] we have
[54:58] Jerusalem and we have the New
[55:04] Jerusalem but we will we are going there
[55:08] to
[55:10] where Moses and
[55:12] [Music]
[55:14] Elijah will come to
[55:19] Jerusalem and the
[55:21] time of the
[55:24] Gentiles when it is
[55:27] finished and it
[55:31] is will come to that what's next on the
[55:37] program is for Moses and
[55:40] Elijah is the
[55:42] [Music]
[55:43] rapture the church should be
[55:46] ruptured no force can stop
[55:53] that amen amen it will be
[55:58] ruptured very
[56:00] soon then after that according to his
[56:05] word Moses and
[56:07] Elijah they will come
[56:11] to to the
[56:13] Jews which is the Sixth
[56:19] Seal The Sixth Seal is Moses and
[56:23] Elijah
[56:27] it was opened
[56:29] there and they are coming to
[56:33] Jerusalem that's why the prophet of God
[56:37] says the
[56:39] six is the Tribulation
[56:43] seal because it brings Moses and
[56:47] Elijah to Jerusalem Jerusalem amen
[56:52] brothera they are dead brothera
[56:55] no they were seen on M
[57:00] Transfiguration in their
[57:06] the now that's why you see it's shaking
[57:11] now we I'm following the events in
[57:19] Jerusalem right amen instead of checking
[57:22] on the
[57:23] television how and Dollar on the
[57:28] television how the dollar and the
[57:30] performs performs yeah there are people
[57:35] every morning they

[57:53] dollar
[57:55] R dollar shall pass
[58:00] away did you hear the message Heaven and
[58:04] Earth shall pass
[58:07] away and he says
[58:10] behold I create new
[58:13] heaven I make new
[58:15] Heaven and if you are told that this
[58:21] will pass away you start to work for the
[58:25] one that is coming in if the
[58:29] seven this seven will pass away
[58:33] then the Sons and Daughters of God are
[58:38] looking at the next
[58:41] seven because this seven is meain but
[58:46] the next seven is the angels from
[58:52] eternity
[58:53] amen is that
[58:56] right
[58:58] now I read
[59:01] here
[59:03] if if you knew what eternity
[59:09] is do you know what
[59:14] is all
[59:19] right I can prepare for
[59:23] future
[59:25] do we have future in this
[59:30] world which one if you have
[59:33] one which
[59:38] one because you can't sell that to a
[59:42] Christian a Christian knows that the
[59:46] future is God
[59:51] himself
[59:53] so he serves or she serves
[59:58] God knowing
[1:00:01] that that's where she or he is
[1:00:06] going okay now let me read
[1:00:10] this
[1:00:12] uh there are
[1:00:16] angels you know there Seven
[1:00:21] Stars and we have angels
[1:00:25] from
[1:00:27] Heaven because before we touch I ask for
[1:00:31] S is this the
[1:00:34] time now it

[1:00:48] [Music]

[1:00:53] ages
[1:00:56] but then the bride of Christ
[1:00:59] now she is no longer
[1:01:02] there amen she
[1:01:04] is in this
[1:01:08] seven which is a pyramid of
[1:01:14] angels now you watch this
[1:01:19] pyramid you have the pyramids of
[1:01:23] stone and you have the Pyramid of
[1:01:27] angels
[1:01:29] amen okay amen the very same
[1:01:32] Prophet was
[1:01:34] introduced to the
[1:01:36] pyramid where he was
[1:01:39] put the
[1:01:41] pyramid in that
[1:01:43] constellation but we realize then after
[1:01:47] that it was another
[1:01:50] servant which is now a pyramid of angels
[1:01:55] he was put also in that
[1:02:02] pyramid now he can save you
[1:02:06] only if you are moving together with the
[1:02:15] program okay amen seven
[1:02:20] Church do we have seven
[1:02:23] churches
[1:02:25] no they have
[1:02:26] passed
[1:02:28] away now it's seven
[1:02:32] angels I can read just one small
[1:02:36] part the Angels lowered
[1:02:40] themselves from
[1:02:41] Heaven standing in the G page
[1:02:45] 21 to bring the
[1:02:50] message so you only know the
[1:02:53] message
[1:02:55] of this seven
[1:02:59] Messengers amen amen but the message
[1:03:02] don't end
[1:03:03] there you go further now it
[1:03:09] says uh page
[1:03:11] 21 standing in the Gap the Angels lower
[1:03:17] themselves from Heaven to bring the
[1:03:23] message amen now he says these ones they
[1:03:28] came from
[1:03:33] eternity Eastward
[1:03:37] Eastward East
[1:03:41] West as
[1:03:44] Adam the prophet of God
[1:03:47] says I had to go
[1:03:53] Eastward in
[1:03:56] Eden the the Garden of
[1:03:59] Eden was
[1:04:03] put
[1:04:05] what now if brother Bram
[1:04:08] says I went
[1:04:12] West
[1:04:14] where if there
[1:04:17] East and Men was placed
[1:04:20] East now there was
[1:04:23] West
[1:04:25] now to meet the angel he to go
[1:04:32] west so that's why after brother Bram
[1:04:37] says east and
[1:04:46] west all right
[1:04:49] amen placed
[1:04:53] East
[1:04:55] he had to go to
[1:04:58] w to meet with the Angel's
[1:05:03] [Music]
[1:05:05] message
[1:05:07] West after that he returned
[1:05:10] East because man was pleased
[1:05:18] East with the Angel's
[1:05:23] message
[1:05:24] he met he met that
[1:05:27] angel then he came
[1:05:30] back if now this Prophet as an
[1:05:34] angel he had to
[1:05:37] go for the
[1:05:41] message for
[1:05:43] opening of the seventh
[1:05:47] seal she had to meet an
[1:05:52] angel not a messeng
[1:05:54] now an angel from
[1:06:02] eternity
[1:06:03] right
[1:06:05] then if you come with an angel's
[1:06:12] message
[1:06:15] uh where will you preach that
[1:06:21] message
[1:06:23] unless
[1:06:24] you meet the same
[1:06:32] type if
[1:06:34] God changed his H
[1:06:40] messenger he must change the
[1:06:47] audience
[1:06:49] amen what if the messenger is
[1:06:53] changed
[1:06:54] but the audience is not
[1:06:58] changed because this thing has to go
[1:07:04] together
[1:07:06] amen that's
[1:07:09] why he
[1:07:11] says this part the Angels lower
[1:07:17] themselves but I find it here also it is
[1:07:21] in this is this the
[1:07:27] I don't know if uh the pages are the
[1:07:33] same
[1:07:35] says watching Eastward and right and I'm
[1:07:40] I'm trying to
[1:07:45] locate all
[1:07:47] right it's this one doesn't correspond
[1:07:52] with let me
[1:07:54] reach from
[1:07:56] here because I'm looking at the one
[1:08:00] talking about the
[1:08:04] new the
[1:08:08] new amen amen all right but it should
[1:08:13] let me try
[1:08:14] here but it shook
[1:08:17] the read from here and when he did I was
[1:08:22] still looking Westward
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:26] you know you go back there that's East
[1:08:30] West man is pleased
[1:08:32] West but to meet the
[1:08:35] angel he speaks
[1:08:38] of he was placed
[1:08:42] East all right

[1:09:35] angels those shaped back
[1:09:40] Wings traveling faster than
[1:09:44] sound
[1:09:48] travel you know if you can see something
[1:09:51] that is traveling faster than

[1:27:19] what there's disputes on this thing so
[1:27:24] for but what I'm want to
[1:27:28] say when one of the
[1:27:32] astronauts they required from
[1:27:35] him about because coming
[1:27:40] back they say I'm not saying to you they
[1:27:45] went to the
[1:27:46] moon I want to type to you
[1:27:50] something on their return
[1:27:53] there this H they came with a
[1:28:00] stone
[1:28:01] they they call that stone gen Genesis
[1:28:08] stone
[1:28:10] stone amen amen why because a
[1:28:16] stone
[1:28:19] carries history
[1:28:23] the stone has some
[1:28:26] [Music]
[1:28:29] layers if
[1:28:31] you go
[1:28:33] science they will tell you
[1:28:36] that this stone is so so so years
[1:28:42] old how do you know
[1:28:47] scientist I
[1:28:49] have uh studied the layers
[1:28:53] in the
[1:28:55] stone that's why they call him Rock of
[1:29:03] Ages because he said Upon This
[1:29:06] Rock I will build my
[1:29:11] church so the
[1:29:13] layers in the
[1:29:17] Rock it's of
[1:29:20] Ages amen now that's why seven Church
[1:29:25] ages when he said of the church he said

[1:29:35] church Upon This
[1:29:40] Rock and the Gates of
[1:29:43] Hell shall never
[1:29:45] never Prevail over
[1:29:50] it Hallelujah
[1:29:52] all right
[1:29:54] amen that's him the Eternal
[1:30:01] one somebody was
[1:30:04] saying can men kill
[1:30:10] God now they look at the Lord Jesus
[1:30:14] Christ and they see a man who
[1:30:18] suffered and they was even crucified
[1:30:24] so they can't accept
[1:30:27] him because to them he a man who came he
[1:30:33] ate he suffered and so
[1:30:39] forth that's how they present him to
[1:30:43] themselves in that
[1:30:48] form okay but
[1:30:52] the
[1:30:55] Insiders they knew
[1:30:57] that in
[1:31:01] Jesus was
[1:31:05] life a life that could not
[1:31:09] die when they kill they killed the
[1:31:15] flesh but not
[1:31:17] him because he
[1:31:20] said
[1:31:22] destroy this
[1:31:26] Temple he never said destroy
[1:31:30] me destroy this Temple he was referring
[1:31:34] to the
[1:31:38] body and I will raise it
[1:31:41] up
[1:31:46] in and in the on the third
[1:31:50] day it happened
[1:31:53] he
[1:31:54] came into that
[1:31:57] body
[1:31:59] again and they call it
[1:32:05] Resurrection he came
[1:32:09] back now you see we are waiting for him
[1:32:13] we'll meet him in the
[1:32:17] air we shall
[1:32:19] change in a twinkling of an eye
[1:32:23] oh I'm waiting for that
[1:32:25] moment when we shall
[1:32:27] change that's why we say goodbye
[1:32:32] [Music]
[1:32:35] world the things of the
[1:32:39] world if you are a
[1:32:44] citizen okay amen we are we are not yet
[1:32:49] here but we are going
[1:32:54] today we were laying
[1:32:56] here sort of a
[1:33:00] foundation then we'll come
[1:33:03] there after that I will ask whether the
[1:33:07] seventh was revealed to you or
[1:33:11] [Music]
[1:33:15] not like this
[1:33:19] part all the way back
[1:33:25] from
[1:33:27] Genesis this
[1:33:29] seventh
[1:33:31] SE is spoken
[1:33:35] of from the very beginning of
[1:33:42] Genesis you
[1:33:44] see this seventh
[1:33:47] seal now how can you know this seventh
[1:33:50] seal
[1:33:53] uh it is revealed to a
[1:33:57] being that was
[1:34:01] [Music]
[1:34:03] there
[1:34:04] Revelation
[1:34:06] actually that's why we say the as he
[1:34:10] when he opened the
[1:34:14] seven it
[1:34:16] was silent in heaven
[1:34:19] amen amen amen not when he
[1:34:27] preached that's why people have lost
[1:34:31] it because they are waiting for the
[1:34:34] preaching of the
[1:34:37] seventh but it never said he will preach
[1:34:41] the seven but it says he will open
[1:34:44] [Music]
[1:34:46] it when he
[1:34:50] opened H amen
[1:34:54] amen what is
[1:34:59] revelation
[1:35:01] Revelation I'm not talking about
[1:35:03] preaching we are talking about
[1:35:07] re what God
[1:35:09] reveals to
[1:35:11] you now that's
[1:35:14] why you can
[1:35:17] preach
[1:35:20] revelation and say I preached Revelation
[1:35:23] now they have received
[1:35:25] Revelation no we'll come to that that's
[1:35:29] why the the seals you can't preach the
[1:35:32] seventh
[1:35:37] seal and
[1:35:40] especially it was
[1:35:43] opened by
[1:35:46] whom
[1:35:48] amen when he opened it was
[1:35:52] Sil
[1:35:55] where and the prophet
[1:35:57] says they were all by
[1:36:01] it in
[1:36:05] heaven they were looking at
[1:36:10] that that's what we'll come to where the
[1:36:12] Bible
[1:36:13] says what is
[1:36:20] men amen
[1:36:22] amen he
[1:36:27] opened you know this body is the body of
[1:36:34] Flesh if you
[1:36:36] want to put something in my
[1:36:41] Souls you've got to
[1:36:47] open all right

[1:36:55] preaches we are
[1:37:08] listening like if you ask
[1:37:11] somebody what is the
[1:37:20] title
[1:37:22] I heard him say something like that
[1:37:24] means you are not
[1:37:29] there amen
[1:37:31] amen now if you were not
[1:37:36] there you heard him saying something
[1:37:39] like that M amen but it was not
[1:37:43] open you were not
[1:37:50] there
[1:37:53] saying the preacher saying we going to
