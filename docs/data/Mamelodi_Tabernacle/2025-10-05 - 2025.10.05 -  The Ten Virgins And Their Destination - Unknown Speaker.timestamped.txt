[1:12:25] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:12:32] [Music]
[1:12:38] Firstly, I want to greet my pastor
[1:12:43] and I want to greet the people who are
[1:12:45] listening to us all over.
[1:12:53] Let God bless them.
[1:12:58] And God
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:03] may God also bless you.
[1:13:08] [Applause]
[1:13:11] I'm standing here because of your
[1:13:13] prayers.
[1:13:17] If it wasn't so,
[1:13:20] I wouldn't have stood here.
[1:13:22] It's because of your prayers. because of
[1:13:25] your prayers.
[1:13:27] I love you.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; I love you.
[1:13:35] Um my brother will read the scripture
[1:13:46] Mark 10 from verse 13- 16. And they
[1:13:50] brought young children to him that he
[1:13:52] should touch them. And his disciples
[1:13:55] rebuked those that brought them. But
[1:13:57] when Jesus saw it, he was much
[1:13:59] displeased and said unto them, "Suffer
[1:14:02] the little children to come unto me, and
[1:14:05] forbid them not. For of such is the
[1:14:07] kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you,
[1:14:11] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[1:14:13] of God as a little child, he shall not
[1:14:16] enter therein." and he took them up in
[1:14:18] his arms, put his hands upon them, and
[1:14:21] blessed them.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible said they brought their
[1:14:29] children to him.
[1:14:36] I believe
[1:14:38] it was women.
[1:14:43] Um that's why I want women to bring
[1:14:46] their children
[1:14:50] but I want men to accompany them
[1:14:55] because I don't know where was the
[1:14:57] husband of those women
[1:15:02] but what I know is that women
[1:15:07] recognize
[1:15:09] the gift in amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; They brought their children
[1:15:18] to that gift.
[1:15:23] They know if if he can just touch their
[1:15:26] children,
[1:15:29] something will happen.
[1:15:32] I believe you believe the same thing.
[1:15:37] I am
[1:15:40] I am your brother.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; You have just chosen me to be your
[1:15:44] pastor,
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; but I'm your brother.
[1:15:50] Um
[1:15:52] I believe
[1:15:55] I am a shepherd
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; because the green shepherd is in me.
[1:16:03] The one who they brought the children to
[1:16:09] is in me.
[1:16:11] I believe he's going to use my hands
[1:16:16] to touch your your child.
[1:16:19] I believe when I touch your child,
[1:16:23] what you have believed,
[1:16:27] it will happen to the child.
[1:16:30] more.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; What is the name?
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Is a girl or a boy? Is a boy. God bless.
[1:16:45] My dear heavenly father
[1:16:48] as they have done there
[1:16:51] when they brought their children unto
[1:16:53] you.
[1:16:55] Here are the family.
[1:16:57] They have brought their child unto me
[1:17:01] believing that they are bringing this

[1:35:43] Before I read the scripture,
[1:35:45] just want to make a little announcement.
[1:35:51] is this
[1:35:55] the family will forgive me
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; and also the church.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; But I want to put this
[1:36:08] information
[1:36:12] the our pastor
[1:36:15] the sickness of our pastor if if it is
[1:36:17] like that
[1:36:21] is the family issue.

[1:36:28] They are the ones who can invite me to
[1:36:31] see the pastor.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; And they can invite you to see the
[1:36:40] pastor.
[1:36:42] If they don't invite me,
[1:36:45] let that not make me angry.
[1:36:53] And there are those who are there
[1:36:56] to help the pastor.
[1:37:00] It is the family discretion.
[1:37:05] It's not our discretion.
[1:37:08] It's not the church.
[1:37:10] It's the family. When they said this one
[1:37:13] must help,
[1:37:16] it's the family. I don't want the church
[1:37:18] to complain about it.
[1:37:22] They mustn't talk about that thing.
[1:37:25] It's not theirs. It's the family. Are
[1:37:28] you together with me?

[1:37:46] when it comes to the church.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:37:52] Um let's open the book of Matthew,
[1:37:54] chapter 25.
[1:37:56] If I if I've wronged somebody, they must
[1:37:58] forgive me.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; And you can come to me and ask me.
[1:38:07] Matthew chapter 25.
[1:38:09] 25.
[1:38:18] Matthews chapter 25
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; verse 1-13
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; from verse 1-13.
[1:38:23] Then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[1:38:26] likened unto 10 virgins which took their
[1:38:29] lambs and went forth to meet the
[1:38:31] bridegroom.
[1:38:32] And five of them were wise and five were
[1:38:35] foolish. They that were foolish took
[1:38:37] their lamps and took no oil with them.
[1:38:40] But the wise took oil in their vessels
[1:38:43] with their lamps. While the bridegroom
[1:38:46] terret, they all slumbered and slept.
[1:38:50] And at midnight there was a cry made,
[1:38:53] behold, a bridegroom cometh, go ye out
[1:38:55] to meet him. Then all those virgins
[1:38:58] arose and trimmed their lamps. And the
[1:39:02] foolish said unto the wise, Give us of
[1:39:05] your oil, for our lambs are gone out.
[1:39:08] But the wise answered, saying, Not so,
[1:39:11] lest there be not enough for us and you.
[1:39:14] But go ye rather to them that sell and
[1:39:18] buy for yourselves. And while they went
[1:39:20] to buy, the bridegroom came, and they
[1:39:23] that were ready went in with him to the
[1:39:26] marriage, and the door was shut.
[1:39:30] Afterward came also the other virgins,
[1:39:32] saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he
[1:39:35] answered and said, Verily, I say unto
[1:39:37] you, I know you not. Watch therefore,
[1:39:41] for ye know neither the door nor the
[1:39:44] hour.
[1:39:46] Watch therefore, for ye know neither the
[1:39:49] day nor the hour wherein the son of man
[1:39:52] cometh.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you. We can read also uh
[1:39:55] revelation chapter 21
[1:39:59] verse uh 20
[1:40:02] 3- 27.
[1:40:05] 21 23 27
[1:40:10] and the city had no need of the sun,
[1:40:13] neither of the moon to shine in it. For
[1:40:17] the glory of God did lighten it, and the
[1:40:20] lamp is the light thereof.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the nations of them which are
[1:40:24] saved shall walk in the light of it. And
[1:40:27] the kings of the earth do bring their
[1:40:29] glory and honor into it. And the gates
[1:40:32] of it shall not be shut at all by day.
[1:40:36] For there shall be no night there. And
[1:40:39] they shall bring the glory and honor of
[1:40:42] the nations into it. and they shall in
[1:40:45] no wise enter into it anything that
[1:40:48] defileth, neither whatsoever workketh
[1:40:51] abomination or maketh a lie, but they
[1:40:54] which are written in the lamb's book of
[1:40:57] life.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Let us close our eyes.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Mighty heavenly father,
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; I've read the scriptures here.

[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; His body
[1:45:36] is the head of his body
[1:45:40] which is the church.
[1:45:44] Amen.
[1:45:46] We have got in the Bible. We have got a
[1:45:49] war
[1:45:53] prostitution.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; In the Bible is the church.
[1:46:01] Re chapter 17 talks about the great war
[1:46:09] which have children
[1:46:13] and her children are held.
[1:46:18] And those hellos
[1:46:22] is the church.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; They are like their mother.
[1:46:31] Amen.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; And we have got the the bride
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; which is also spoken of in the Bible
[1:46:41] and it's the church.
[1:46:45] And uh let me just read something
[1:46:47] perhaps God willing
[1:46:50] because
[1:46:52] this great war
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; didn't go to the
[1:47:00] to wait for the bridegroom.
[1:47:05] This great door
[1:47:08] is self centered.
[1:47:15] But her children,
[1:47:18] they went there
[1:47:21] with the bride
[1:47:25] to wait for the
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; the bridegroom.
[1:47:31] But let me just read something.
[1:47:35] In this book uh they will flush it if
[1:47:39] possible spoken it
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; 63
[1:47:47] 63
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; page 63 or
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; page 63
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; paragraph 31
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; paragraph 31
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; it says here
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; now look there is there is called a war
[1:48:04] in the Bible.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; I want my sisters to forgive me.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; That is what the Bible said. That was
[1:48:14] the Bible said.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Today I'm speaking just plain
[1:48:21] calls her the war the mother of her
[1:48:28] which is the same thing.
[1:48:30] Now if you notice
[1:48:33] there is a war
[1:48:35] spoke of in the Bible
[1:48:38] that is a church
[1:48:43] spoke of in the Bible
[1:48:46] that is a church the bride spoke of in
[1:48:50] the Bible
[1:48:52] that is the church there are three
[1:48:57] in the Bible
[1:48:59] then theible Bible says in page 65
[1:49:03] paragraph 40
[1:49:06] he says now watch then three
[1:49:11] churches
[1:49:14] there is a prostitute
[1:49:16] she didn't come for nothing
[1:49:20] she is self centered in herself
[1:49:26] there was the unwise vision
[1:49:30] which is the Protestant church
[1:49:35] and there was the bride.
[1:49:40] There is three stages of the church in
[1:49:42] the last days.
[1:49:46] We are going to bring them right
[1:49:48] straight out from the from Genesis.
[1:49:53] bringing them out here
[1:49:57] and and and place them in revelation
[1:50:03] in the rapture.
[1:50:05] The Lord willing.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; In other words, we want to see this
[1:50:13] visions
[1:50:17] here with us
[1:50:20] and we want to see them.
[1:50:23] in judgment
[1:50:26] or in during rapture
[1:50:30] or
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; in judgment
[1:50:34] and want to see them in
[1:50:38] the new Jerusalem,
[1:50:42] their positions
[1:50:47] here. Where are they here?
[1:50:53] these visions
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; because
[1:50:58] the Bible here in Matthew
[1:51:02] talks about 10 visions,
[1:51:07] the wise and the foolish.
[1:51:11] And the Bible calls them both visions.
[1:51:18] And if they are vigils,
[1:51:21] It means they are holy.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; It means it is a holy church.
[1:51:30] And because
[1:51:32] the Bible says here,
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; the their only difference
[1:51:39] is that it was
[1:51:43] some
[1:51:44] have oil.
[1:51:47] Some don't have oil, but together
[1:51:53] they are visions.
[1:51:57] And if the Bible
[1:52:00] talks about foolish visions
[1:52:04] being pure,
[1:52:06] clean,
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; then you must check yourself.
[1:52:14] Where do I belong?
[1:52:18] It it it seems as if
[1:52:21] I'm not even a vision.
[1:52:26] I don't belong
[1:52:28] I don't belong to this side
[1:52:31] this side because they are all visions
[1:52:38] that is what that is what the Bible says
[1:52:42] it's not what I'm saying
[1:52:44] that is what the Bible says he says
[1:52:47] there are visions
[1:52:50] let me read here in the 10 visions
[1:52:55] He said, he says here,
[1:52:58] paragraph 156, page 455,
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; he says,
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; both of them were revisions.
[1:53:09] He says here, let's take these two right
[1:53:13] here.
[1:53:15] This is a vision.
[1:53:18] This is a vision.
[1:53:21] This one a foolish vision.
[1:53:24] This was a wise vision.
[1:53:28] But both of them are visions.
[1:53:32] Now if you will take the name vision
[1:53:37] and run it down,
[1:53:41] it means holy,
[1:53:44] clean,
[1:53:46] sanctified.
[1:53:48] The word sanctified
[1:53:51] come from the word sainted
[1:53:56] which mean clean
[1:54:00] like a Hebrew word
[1:54:03] that is Greek word
[1:54:07] sanctify means cleanify
[1:54:11] the green word
[1:54:14] it makes it holymen
[1:54:18] Amen.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Vision
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; and ours in our in in our word
[1:54:28] in order in English
[1:54:32] it is same.
[1:54:34] Now we take three words
[1:54:37] and each word has the same meaning.
[1:54:43] Now spoke of different
[1:54:47] the clean
[1:54:50] holy sanctified
[1:54:53] all three.
[1:54:57] [Music]
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; These are clean.
[1:55:03] It means
[1:55:04] This is a clean church.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; It means it was not a filthy church,
[1:55:16] but it was a clean church.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; These 10 visions,
[1:55:25] let me read page 383
[1:55:31] just to emphasize
[1:55:34] The vision.
[1:55:38] Look, 10 of them.
[1:55:41] They went out
[1:55:43] where visions.
[1:55:46] There were 10
[1:55:48] went to meet the Lord. Now the word
[1:55:51] divisions
[1:55:53] means sanctified.
[1:55:56] Does anybody know that
[1:55:59] holy
[1:56:00] pure
[1:56:02] sanctified
[1:56:04] there were 10 of them that went out to
[1:56:09] meet the Lord.
[1:56:11] Now remember they had been falling
[1:56:15] asleep
[1:56:17] in all in one watch,
[1:56:22] two watch,
[1:56:25] three watch until the seventh watch.
[1:56:31] We shall come back to
[1:56:34] Are you together with me? Amen.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; These visions,
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; they were all vig
[1:56:47] some have oil
[1:56:49] and some didn't have it and I shall come
[1:56:52] to that.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; The wise visions
[1:56:58] are the chosen
[1:57:02] who has chosen them.
[1:57:06] All these visions
[1:57:09] they are the chosen
[1:57:12] there are those who are chosen.
[1:57:15] According to Matthew the book of Matthew
[1:57:17] 22:42
[1:57:20] it says many are called
[1:57:25] and few
[1:57:27] are chosen.
[1:57:28] And those few which are chosen they are
[1:57:33] called the bride.
[1:57:35] They are called the wise vision.
[1:57:40] They are called they are chosen from
[1:57:43] those who are called.
[1:57:46] Are you together with me? In other those
[1:57:48] who remain
[1:57:51] because some are chosen
[1:57:54] from others and some remain. So those
[1:57:57] who remain they are called the remnant.
[1:58:03] And those remnants are called the
[1:58:05] foolish.
[1:58:10] I said who chose them?
[1:58:14] The owner.
[1:58:16] Amen.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; God himself.
[1:58:19] Amen. Has chosen.
[1:58:23] He said you cannot you cannot say why
[1:58:26] did he choose me or not? Why did he not
[1:58:28] choose me?
[1:58:33] The remnant
[1:58:35] is a piece that is
[1:58:38] cut left
[1:58:44] of the same
[1:58:46] good
[1:58:49] or the same clothes.
[1:58:53] That is that is what we call the
[1:58:55] remnant.
[1:58:58] Are you together with me? But let me
[1:59:01] just read something for you here
[1:59:04] about the remnant.
[1:59:09] What the what the prophet says about the
[1:59:12] remnant
[1:59:15] because the remnant
[1:59:17] is those who remain
[1:59:20] when they chosen
[1:59:23] were chosen
[1:59:26] some remain.
[1:59:29] All right.
[1:59:30] Are you together with me?
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; But now let me just read what the
[1:59:35] prophet says in this book
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; 54
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; 54
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read paragraph 268.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 268.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; It says here what is a remnant?
[1:59:52] piece that is cut left
[1:59:58] the same kind of goods.
[2:00:03] Is that right? you go to cut you a dress
[2:00:10] out of a caligo good
[2:00:15] then you spread out the big piece
[2:00:21] of calig in other words you went to the
[2:00:23] shop
[2:00:25] you find the clothes there
[2:00:28] but you choose that
[2:00:32] among those
[2:00:34] you take that
[2:00:36] which you have chosen, which you have
[2:00:39] laughed, then you spread it upon the
[2:00:41] table
[2:00:44] out of it. Why did you choose the cal
[2:00:48] you want to make a dress out of the
[2:00:49] table?
[2:00:52] Then you put the the the goods on the
[2:00:55] table.
[2:00:58] Then out then you you take the pattern.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; You put it on the on the on the whole
[2:01:04] good.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Then you take out the pattern.
[2:01:11] Take out the Caesar
[2:01:14] to to to take the pattern out.
[2:01:17] Just like many are called
[2:01:22] the whole the whole
[2:01:26] are called
[2:01:27] but out of the
[2:01:30] you are going to take the pattern
[2:01:33] which is the chosen.
[2:01:38] Amen. The the truth cannot say put the
[2:01:42] pattern here. I I I want to be part of
[2:01:45] the pattern.
[2:01:50] The owner has got that discretion
[2:01:55] to put the pattern here
[2:01:57] and take the scissor and cut according
[2:02:01] to the pattern.
[2:02:03] The Caesar is directed by the pattern
[2:02:07] where he had to come back.
[2:02:10] Oh, my students are hearing me.
[2:02:14] Amen.
[2:02:15] They're hearing the lecture.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; The Caesar
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; is going according to
[2:02:28] pattern.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; The pattern is already there. When the
[2:02:33] when the when the this woman go to the
[2:02:36] shop
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; to look for the the goods,
[2:02:42] he had the pattern.
[2:02:45] [Music]
[2:02:46] Amen.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; When he took the goose there,
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; was already there.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Before
[2:02:59] Before there was a star,
[2:03:03] before there is a speck of dust,
[2:03:08] you were there in God's mind. You were
[2:03:12] in you were the mind of God.
[2:03:16] He had you.
[2:03:18] He He He said, "I'm going to call this
[2:03:21] one."
[2:03:24] Amen.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; No one advised him.
[2:03:27] No preacher.
[2:03:30] Amen.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; He himself
[2:03:36] before the foundation of
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; you were there in God's spine.
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:46] the pattern was there.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Let me read
[2:03:54] what the prophet says.
[2:03:58] It is your business
[2:04:01] where you lay the pattern
[2:04:05] is God's business
[2:04:08] is God's business
[2:04:10] where he lays the pattern.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; He cuts it right out.
[2:04:18] Is that right?
[2:04:20] And now this
[2:04:22] the rest of the Caligo
[2:04:26] here is just as good as the Calico. It's
[2:04:30] just as good as the
[2:04:34] as in the
[2:04:37] as in the party. Are you together with
[2:04:40] me? In other words, they left the
[2:04:42] remnant
[2:04:45] is just as perfect as the that one.
[2:04:55] But it is God's election.
[2:04:59] God elects his church.
[2:05:04] God predestinate his church.
[2:05:09] God forained that
[2:05:13] for ordained his church.
[2:05:16] He takes that church.
[2:05:19] out and the remnant
[2:05:22] is left to go through the tribulation
[2:05:25] period.
[2:05:29] Amen.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:05:31] Why it is left to go through the
[2:05:37] I will tell you
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; my students. Are you listening?
[2:05:50] All right. If you are together with me,
[2:05:53] let me go on.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; We have said the foolish visions
[2:06:00] are the remnant
[2:06:02] and the wise visions
[2:06:05] is the pattern
[2:06:07] taken by the owner
[2:06:11] to make her.
[2:06:15] Amen. Then after that
[2:06:18] after she has through the dress
[2:06:21] this dress is beautiful.
[2:06:26] Then she put the dress there. She went
[2:06:30] back to look at the remnant.
[2:06:33] What can I do with this remnant?
[2:06:36] Because I love them.
[2:06:39] [Music]
[2:06:44] Are you together with me?
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Let me look for another book here.
[2:06:50] If I can find it and read it.
[2:06:55] What the prophet says
[2:06:57] about these things.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; The book here. Yeah, I found the book
[2:07:05] because
[2:07:08] the prophet says
[2:07:10] we preach salvation
[2:07:14] as if salvation is for all.
[2:07:19] But we know it is not for
[2:07:24] but we preach it.
[2:07:27] Amen.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; But we know it is not for
[2:07:33] we preach healing. We preach healing
[2:07:37] as if healing is for all.
[2:07:40] God will heal you. We say so. But we
[2:07:44] know that is not for all.
[2:07:47] [Applause]
[2:07:51] Hallelujah.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Are you together?
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Students,
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; students.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Let me read something here.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; My my is listening.
[2:08:09] [Music]
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; We want to read something here.
[2:08:14] The book is proving his way.
[2:08:18] I'm going to reach paragraph 88. Page
[2:08:20] 17. Paragraph 88.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Page 17. Paragraph 88.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Now, it is the same thing today.
[2:08:29] We are at the end time.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Those people ought to have Noah.
[2:08:36] Now, you notice
[2:08:39] Noah was a type of the Jews
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; that will be carried over.
[2:08:48] through the tribulation
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; was a type of the real message.
[2:08:57] The real message
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; of the translation of the church.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Enoch. Yes.
[2:09:09] for Enoch was taken up
[2:09:13] and then the flood came.
[2:09:19] The first the first prophet
[2:09:24] Enoch
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; was taken out of the ways
[2:09:28] so Noah could go on with with with his
[2:09:36] God could go on with Noah.
[2:09:40] In other words, Enoch was taken
[2:09:43] so that God can come
[2:09:47] and deal with Noah.
[2:09:49] I have said after the pattern was done
[2:09:54] the owner of the pattern
[2:09:56] come back to the remnant
[2:10:02] what to do with the remnant.
[2:10:08] Now the church will be taken away
[2:10:12] so that God can deal again
[2:10:17] with the Jews, the remnant of the Jews
[2:10:23] 144,000 144,000.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; We have been through it in the
[2:10:27] scripture.
[2:10:29] I will come back to this.
[2:10:32] I will tell you about that.
[2:10:34] Then I must read something here again.
[2:10:38] in the book future home
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; if I can find it. All right. Thank you,
[2:10:42] my brother. Amen. I've got someone here.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; You see, when you lecture, you must have
[2:10:47] somebody
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; who will say, "Here is another one.
[2:10:57] Um,
[2:10:59] uh, future home paragraph 121.
[2:11:03] home 121
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; uh to 122
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; I think it's page uh 17
[2:11:14] was a type of the remnant
[2:11:20] that that is carried over
[2:11:24] not the translated
[2:11:29] Enoch was one man
[2:11:32] went in the rapture
[2:11:34] before the flood came
[2:11:38] showing that the church does not go into
[2:11:41] the church does not go in the
[2:11:43] tribulation.
[2:11:46] When we talk about the church,
[2:11:48] we talk about the
[2:11:51] bride does not go into
[2:11:54] or anything around it
[2:11:58] was translated.
[2:12:00] One man or that church may remember that
[2:12:06] church may be a number
[2:12:09] but the bride is going to be a very
[2:12:12] small.
[2:12:16] Amen.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Many
[2:12:19] are called,
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; few
[2:12:23] are chosen. The church may be many. The
[2:12:28] foolish visions
[2:12:31] may be many. But the bride will be
[2:12:35] shocked.
[2:12:40] They will, it says here,
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; but the bride is going to be a very
[2:12:45] small group
[2:12:48] that will make up the bride.
[2:12:52] Now the church may be a great number.
[2:12:56] But the bride you see compare eight with
[2:13:00] one. Okay.
[2:13:05] Because one
[2:13:07] type the bride
[2:13:12] the remnant.
[2:13:17] You see now you can compare
[2:13:20] one with eight.
[2:13:24] It means the bride will be few.
[2:13:29] You see? Amen. Eight times eight times
[2:13:32] less
[2:13:36] will be the bride than the church.
[2:13:41] Amen. Amen. If the righteous scarcely be
[2:13:44] saved,
[2:13:50] where will the sinner
[2:13:53] and the ungodly appear?
[2:13:56] those who know better
[2:13:59] to do it and go ahead
[2:14:03] and do it anyhow.
[2:14:06] Those who follow the rules of
[2:14:08] denominations
[2:14:12] instead of the ways,
[2:14:14] where will they appear?
[2:14:18] He had to call the Christians
[2:14:21] taking the name of Christ
[2:14:24] but following the law of the
[2:14:25] denomination.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:34] Taking the pattern
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; is the type of the rapture.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; When you take the pattern
[2:14:44] and leave the remnant
[2:14:48] type of the
[2:14:51] because the rapture
[2:14:54] is for the bride only.
[2:14:58] Even when Christ come
[2:15:01] to redeem,
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; he was he was only he was coming only to
[2:15:06] redeem his
[2:15:10] the bride, not others.
[2:15:13] When he was praying,
[2:15:16] he was praying for the bride,
[2:15:19] not others.
[2:15:22] Amen.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; He says here
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; now the rapture is only
[2:15:30] this rapture that we are talking about
[2:15:34] is only for the
[2:15:37] Amen. Remember the Bible said
[2:15:41] and the rest of the dead
[2:15:46] live not for thousand years.
[2:15:50] There is great rapture.
[2:15:53] If there is no rapture, friends,
[2:15:56] where are we at?
[2:15:59] What are we going to do?
[2:16:02] What age are we living in?
[2:16:06] What promise do we have?
[2:16:09] There is going to be rapture.
[2:16:12] The Bible says there will be.
[2:16:15] [Music]
[2:16:16] It will be only for the elected.
[2:16:21] the elected lady,
[2:16:26] the bride, the wise vision.
[2:16:32] Amen.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; In this day that is pulled out
[2:16:37] of the church.
[2:16:41] Amen. The Caesar
[2:16:44] going
[2:16:46] that is the message
[2:16:49] in each age.
[2:16:51] There is a Caesar
[2:16:55] which was the message for that
[2:16:57] particular age.
[2:17:00] The prophet says these seven messengers
[2:17:04] are making God known
[2:17:07] to the people.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Those who have an ear
[2:17:15] Amen.
[2:17:17] [Music]
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; God is responsible for his
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; members from every denomination
[2:17:32] up the bride,
[2:17:35] the bride tree
[2:17:38] in the tape. The bride is in the tape
[2:17:44] and that is the one that the bride is
[2:17:50] that is rather that is the bride
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; is the one that is going to be in the
[2:17:56] rapture.
[2:17:59] That that alone that alone
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; nothing but that is going to be in the
[2:18:07] rapture
[2:18:10] but the bride the elected one
[2:18:14] fornown by God
[2:18:17] from the beginning
[2:18:19] the father spiritual gene
[2:18:28] I was in my father.
[2:18:31] I was in my grand
[2:18:34] was passed
[2:18:37] from a generation to a generation to
[2:18:39] generation until to my father
[2:18:44] because
[2:18:45] my birth was predestinated.
[2:18:51] Your birth was predestinated.
[2:18:54] You would have died
[2:18:58] while you are in the in your
[2:19:00] grandfather.
[2:19:02] Your grandfather should have been
[2:19:03] killed.
[2:19:06] But he was not killed.
[2:19:08] Amen. Because he was fighting in a
[2:19:11] battle.
[2:19:13] But he was the only one who escaped.
[2:19:18] Why? Why? Why was he why did he escape?
[2:19:21] It was because of you.
[2:19:24] You were there in his jeans.
[2:19:28] [Applause]
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Even the marriage of your father to your
[2:19:38] mother.
[2:19:41] God looked at the woman.
[2:19:44] He had your picture.
[2:19:48] He said if I to bring this picture
[2:19:51] I must bring this man
[2:19:54] this woman they will bring my picture
[2:19:59] where is predestinated
[2:20:03] [Music]
[2:20:07] is not just a miracle.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; There is nothing wrong with God.
[2:20:19] You can say what you want to say.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; You see we are not forcing people.
[2:20:35] We are bringing a mirror
[2:20:38] that this is the bride.
[2:20:45] You look in the mirror,
[2:20:47] you see yourself or you don't find
[2:20:49] yourself.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; It's not the problem of me bringing the
[2:20:54] mirror.
[2:20:55] I'm just bringing the mirror
[2:21:04] because
[2:21:06] we are bringing the bride.
[2:21:10] [Music]
[2:21:12] Let me say this.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; The bride and these visions, this
[2:21:19] started back there
[2:21:22] from the first church age.
[2:21:26] But these ones we are talking about in
[2:21:28] Matthews,
[2:21:30] they are the bride of the seventh watch.
[2:21:35] They are the visions of the seventh
[2:21:37] watch.
[2:21:40] The seven church age.
[2:21:43] Amen. Amen.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; The seventh watch
[2:21:48] is the seven church age. Church age.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; Are you together? the ones we are
[2:21:53] reading about
[2:21:56] who went to meet the bridegroom
[2:22:00] because the Lord himself
[2:22:03] will descend from heaven with a shout, a
[2:22:06] voice and a trumpet.
[2:22:11] Where is the voice? Where will the voice
[2:22:13] come from?
[2:22:15] It will come from us.
[2:22:18] [Music]
[2:22:20] If you are waiting for something to come
[2:22:22] from heaven, you are lost my sister or
[2:22:25] my brother.
[2:22:28] You miss where the voice is.
[2:22:32] While Cornelius was praying,
[2:22:36] God said Cornelius
[2:22:38] stand up.
[2:22:43] There is an answer here.
[2:22:46] Go to Job,
[2:22:48] you'll find in the house of Simon,
[2:22:53] you'll find Simon.
[2:22:56] Your answer is there.
[2:23:00] If you can go to the mountain now
[2:23:04] and pray and God answers you
[2:23:08] is not God. If if he cannot say to you,
[2:23:13] go to pastor
[2:23:16] at mayor's park, you'll get the answer.
[2:23:19] If he doesn't say that
[2:23:22] is not God,
[2:23:27] but if he's the one, he will say to you,
[2:23:31] "My son, I love you.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Go to party."
[2:23:39] That's why he said to Cornelius, "Go to
[2:23:42] Job in Simon Peter's house.
[2:23:46] There is my voice there."
[2:23:53] While Peter was still speaking, while
[2:23:56] while he was still teaching them
[2:23:59] to brothers and sisters
[2:24:02] and then while we are they were they
[2:24:05] were they were busy speaking in tongues
[2:24:08] in language.
[2:24:12] They they received the Holy Spirit.
[2:24:15] Not when not even when he was he laid
[2:24:17] hands on them
[2:24:19] because he was the answer.
[2:24:22] [Music]
[2:24:25] God was there
[2:24:28] in the house of Cornelius
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; in flesh.
[2:24:32] [Applause]
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Are you together with us?
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; From the first each age,
[2:24:49] it has its visions.
[2:24:53] The wise visions
[2:24:56] are those who have an ear
[2:25:00] in that age.
[2:25:02] Amen.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; The wise visions
[2:25:08] are those who had an ear
[2:25:12] in that age. Those who didn't have any
[2:25:15] earl.
[2:25:21] [Music]
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Let me read something here.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; It says here,
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; don't worry if you don't have it there.
[2:25:32] It is most evident
[2:25:35] from these scriptures that no man of
[2:25:39] himself
[2:25:41] can hear God.
[2:25:43] That ability
[2:25:45] has to be given
[2:25:48] of God.
[2:25:50] Even if the scripture says, "He that
[2:25:53] have an ear,
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; let him hear
[2:25:58] it was directed to a specific class of
[2:26:04] not to all
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; because that group that can hear
[2:26:11] the ability
[2:26:13] to hear.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; Putting these verses together,
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; we see that there is only one group
[2:26:25] and that that very special group
[2:26:29] of people who are able to hear
[2:26:34] what the spirit says in each age
[2:26:38] [Applause]
[2:26:40] is one special group.
[2:26:43] that receives the revelation
[2:26:46] for each age.
[2:26:50] That group is of God
[2:26:56] because the group that cannot hear
[2:27:01] is not of God.
[2:27:03] The group that can hear
[2:27:07] what the spirit is saying
[2:27:10] and receives the revelation
[2:27:13] is that group
[2:27:16] that distract you
[2:27:18] in the book of Corinthians.
[2:27:21] Let me go on here. They are the ones
[2:27:24] that are born of God.
[2:27:28] Amen.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; It is Amen.
[2:27:34] Amen.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; And to every age
[2:27:39] we hear the same truth.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; He that had an ear, let him hear what
[2:27:47] the spirit say to the churches.
[2:27:50] But only
[2:27:53] spiritfilled man
[2:27:55] can hear the revelation for that age.
[2:27:59] No one else.
[2:28:02] can hear.
[2:28:05] No sir.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; The difference of this vision
[2:28:11] is that some of oil which is the Holy
[2:28:17] Spirit which is in our age in our ages
[2:28:22] which is the which is the rapturing
[2:28:24] faith
[2:28:28] in our age. all the ages it was the Holy
[2:28:32] Spirit. But in our age, it is the
[2:28:35] rapture in faith.
[2:28:38] In our age, but from the first year,
[2:28:44] it was the Holy Ghost.
[2:28:46] But let me tell you,
[2:28:49] okay,
[2:28:51] those who were filled with the Holy
[2:28:53] Ghost
[2:28:55] had the word
[2:28:58] and receive it and lived it, lived by
[2:29:02] it. Those who did not have the spirit
[2:29:07] had it only
[2:29:09] as a cannal man
[2:29:16] put a wrong interpretation
[2:29:20] and went into sin
[2:29:23] and in every age
[2:29:25] every age is is the age of the Holy
[2:29:28] Spirit
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; for the true believer. Those
[2:29:36] who had the spirit,
[2:29:38] the teacher
[2:29:40] had the word and the spirit in them
[2:29:45] took the word and taught it
[2:29:49] reveal it to them. And they were they
[2:29:53] were the group that had the messenger
[2:29:59] and his message
[2:30:01] took it and leave it.
[2:30:05] Amen.
[2:30:10] There were people
[2:30:12] who have got the spirit.
[2:30:15] That's what the Bible says.
[2:30:18] Joshua and
[2:30:20] they had another
[2:30:25] they were going with people. They could
[2:30:28] identify
[2:30:30] where God is.
[2:30:33] So they followed Moses. They saved
[2:30:36] Moses. They saved Moses.
[2:30:42] Amen.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Because they've seen God. They were not
[2:30:47] saving Moses per se,
[2:30:50] but they were saving God
[2:30:53] in Moses.
[2:30:55] Amen. Because they had another spirit.
[2:30:58] Even now, if you have got another
[2:31:01] spirit, you will save correctly.
[2:31:06] Amen.
[2:31:08] But if you don't have a spirit, you will
[2:31:11] paramulate.
[2:31:14] Those
[2:31:16] who have got the spirit,
[2:31:19] those have an ear,
[2:31:21] they could hear the message from the
[2:31:25] messenger and receive it and the spirit
[2:31:29] in them feel it to them.
[2:31:34] They were born with something in them
[2:31:38] just like an igllet. It was born being
[2:31:41] an eagle.
[2:31:43] It was the It has the eagle nature in
[2:31:46] it.
[2:31:48] It didn't acquire the nature of an
[2:31:51] eagle, but it was born
[2:31:54] with a nature.
[2:31:56] It was an eagle by birth. If you are the
[2:31:59] child of God, you are born
[2:32:03] with something in you.
[2:32:06] [Applause]
[2:32:10] It will not come someday.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; There was a little Brennham
[2:32:22] there which is a nature
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; which which can receive the word.
[2:32:35] Amen. He says
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; if you fish, if you throw a net into the
[2:32:42] when you take it out,
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; it comes with many things,
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; frogs,
[2:32:50] catps,
[2:32:55] water snakes.
[2:32:57] You must know a frog was a frog to begin
[2:33:00] with.
[2:33:03] before they can throw the net.
[2:33:06] The frog was a frog.
[2:33:09] The net cannot change the frog.
[2:33:13] But the owner of the net was looking for
[2:33:16] the fish.
[2:33:21] When he throw things on the on the
[2:33:23] shoulder,
[2:33:26] he was looking for the fish. The frog
[2:33:29] will go back into the water.
[2:33:38] This is what the prophet says.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; It's not me.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; It is what what I want to say. I'm
[2:33:50] talking about the wise vision.
[2:33:54] It was she was born wise.
[2:34:00] He was a vision.
[2:34:02] among the visions
[2:34:04] but wise.
[2:34:06] [Music]
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; No way
[2:34:13] she could tend to be foolish.
[2:34:17] No way
[2:34:19] foolish could tend to be wise.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; The pattern has declared. Amen.
[2:34:33] This one is foolish.
[2:34:36] This one is
[2:34:39] that is what God said.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; I said every age is the age of the Holy
[2:34:44] Spirit.
[2:34:47] For a true believer,
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; the group that have the the spirit, they
[2:34:53] have the ear
[2:34:56] is those who hear the messenger.
[2:35:00] Hear the message through the messenger
[2:35:04] and receive the message of the message
[2:35:10] and live it
[2:35:13] because it is their life.
[2:35:17] They cannot do otherwise
[2:35:21] because this is their life.
[2:35:24] Amen.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; Are you are you with me then?
[2:35:32] I said if
[2:35:34] my message is still going on, I will cut
[2:35:37] it.
[2:35:43] Um
[2:35:44] these are the visions. These ones
[2:35:48] which we have read about
[2:35:50] are the visions of the seventh watch.
[2:35:56] But I said in each age
[2:36:01] in each watch
[2:36:04] there was vision
[2:36:08] they died there.
[2:36:12] The wise
[2:36:14] died there with oil.
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; The foolish died there without oil.
[2:36:24] Amen.
[2:36:28] They are part of these ones
[2:36:32] of the seventh watch.
[2:36:35] And the wise visions
[2:36:37] from the first watch
[2:36:40] are are part of these ones
[2:36:44] of the seventh watch
[2:36:48] because both of them they have got they
[2:36:51] they place where they have to wait.
[2:36:57] Because when they died there, they had
[2:37:00] the place where they had to wait.
[2:37:05] Some
[2:37:07] because some they were waiting for the
[2:37:09] second resurrection
[2:37:12] which are the foolish
[2:37:15] and some which are the wise vision
[2:37:19] or waiting for the first vis.
[2:37:22] Are you together?
[2:37:24] Then they wait somewhere.
[2:37:28] This foolish
[2:37:30] they must wait for at the fifth
[2:37:32] dimension
[2:37:36] for purification.
[2:37:39] They must be purified.
[2:37:43] Are you together? Because
[2:37:46] we have got the remnant of the Jews.
[2:37:51] Read it my brother. Just read Revelation
[2:37:54] chapter 12 I think. So
[2:37:57] my brother verse uh the last verse
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; which is uh verse 17
[2:38:09] verse
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; verse 17
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; 17.
[2:38:13] And the dragon was wroth with the woman
[2:38:16] and went to make war with the remnant of
[2:38:18] her seed which keep the commandments of
[2:38:21] God and have the testimony of Jesus
[2:38:24] Christ.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; All right, let me check my book here.
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the let me read the
[2:38:33] read it again the brother.
[2:38:36] And the dragon was wrath with the woman
[2:38:39] and went to make war with the remnant of
[2:38:42] her seed which keep the commandments of
[2:38:45] God and have the testimony of Jesus
[2:38:47] Christ.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; They kept the commandment of God
[2:38:54] and the testimony
[2:38:57] of Jesus Christ.
[2:39:00] the commandment of God
[2:39:02] and the testimony
[2:39:04] of Jesus Christ. You see this here there
[2:39:08] are two groups.
[2:39:11] The other group kept the law of God
[2:39:16] keep the commandments of
[2:39:19] another group.
[2:39:21] Another group kept testimony of Jesus
[2:39:25] Christ.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; These are the remnant of the Jews.
[2:39:31] who are keeping the commandment of God.
[2:39:35] These are the remnant of the Gentiles
[2:39:39] who are came the testimony of Jesus
[2:39:41] Christ.
[2:39:43] Are you together with me? You see these
[2:39:45] two
[2:39:47] the the the beast here
[2:39:52] is fighting with them.
[2:39:54] It is during tribulation.
[2:39:58] We find them here.
[2:40:01] Revelation chapter 15. My brother, read
[2:40:04] it there.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; Uh verse
[2:40:10] 1 to three.
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to 3.
[2:40:14] And I saw another sign in heaven, great
[2:40:18] and marvelous, seven angels having the
[2:40:21] seven last plagues, for in them is is
[2:40:24] filled up with wrath of God. And I saw
[2:40:28] as it were a sea of glass mingled
[2:40:32] with fire, and them that had gotten the
[2:40:36] victory over the beast, and over his
[2:40:38] image, and over his mark, and over the
[2:40:42] number of his name, stand on the sea of
[2:40:44] glass, having the hubs of God. You see
[2:40:48] in the Old Testament
[2:40:51] this sea of place
[2:40:56] it was called the lover.
[2:41:03] It was called the lover.
[2:41:05] It was there in the Old Testament
[2:41:09] in the gentile time. Before the
[2:41:11] sacrifice
[2:41:13] can be given,
[2:41:16] it must be brought to this level
[2:41:20] to be washed.
[2:41:22] It was a time
[2:41:24] of the baptism
[2:41:27] before you can be because the Bible says
[2:41:30] Paul says bring your bodies
[2:41:34] as a living sacrifice
[2:41:37] acceptable unto God. Before you can
[2:41:40] bring your body,
[2:41:42] you must go through baptism
[2:41:46] because it was timed there
[2:41:49] before they can be taken to the to be
[2:41:51] sacrificed,
[2:41:53] they must go through the lamb
[2:41:57] because when when Moses was building the
[2:42:01] temple,
[2:42:03] God said according the pattern
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; which I show you on the
[2:42:10] The prophet said, "What Moses saw there
[2:42:14] is what John saw in chapter 4."
[2:42:20] John and because John saw it in heaven.
[2:42:24] Moses saw it also in heaven.
[2:42:27] God said, "Make it here on earth."
[2:42:33] But when they when he when he see the
[2:42:39] It was empty
[2:42:42] out of it. There was no more water
[2:42:45] but there was fire coming.
[2:42:50] It means if you to go there you were you
[2:42:54] will be tribulated.
[2:42:58] Amen.
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; There were people who were found
[2:43:00] standing there.
[2:43:03] It was the foolish vision
[2:43:06] because after realizing that
[2:43:10] there are some people who have been who
[2:43:11] have been teaching baptism here
[2:43:14] that we must be baptized.
[2:43:19] They tried to go there
[2:43:22] to to be baptized in the name of the
[2:43:25] Lord. They found the beast waiting for
[2:43:27] them there
[2:43:29] because the beast was looking for the
[2:43:31] people
[2:43:33] who were been who were baptizing like
[2:43:35] this.
[2:43:37] People were people were following this
[2:43:40] and those people were raptured.
[2:43:43] And these foolish visions, they were
[2:43:45] late.
[2:43:47] When they tried to go there, they were
[2:43:50] tribulated.
[2:43:51] They found that it is the time of
[2:43:53] tribulation
[2:43:54] because they found the fire.
[2:44:02] Then
[2:44:04] when I have read
[2:44:07] said h the beast
[2:44:10] was wroth
[2:44:12] with the remnant of the woman.
[2:44:18] They say those who kept the commandment
[2:44:22] testimony of Jesus.
[2:44:25] I said there were two here.
[2:44:27] I said the foolish visions
[2:44:30] and the 144,000
[2:44:34] are the remnant of the Jews 144
[2:44:39] and then the foolish visions
[2:44:41] are the remnant of the Gentiles
[2:44:45] they were together there.
[2:44:50] Let me just some quotes and I'm going to
[2:44:53] truth and I'm going to come back if God
[2:44:54] willing.
[2:44:58] But let me read this quote.
[2:45:01] The prophet is saying something
[2:45:04] is the seven seag
[2:45:09] page 501 or page 501.
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; Paragraph
[2:45:15] 227.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 227.
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; I read it here.
[2:45:21] Um 57 says here now if God is going to
[2:45:26] patch that vision
[2:45:31] that was good woman
[2:45:34] but she just failed to get the oil in
[2:45:36] her lamp.
[2:45:40] He she was a good woman.
[2:45:43] was a vision but she didn't have oil
[2:45:48] for for that
[2:45:50] she must go through
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; to be patched
[2:45:57] that's why I said through the ages
[2:46:02] they must also be patched
[2:46:06] like the seventh group
[2:46:09] because this seventh group
[2:46:12] it ped by tribulation.
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; The prophet says,
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; he says if God
[2:46:21] is going to p that woman
[2:46:25] who was a good woman
[2:46:28] but just to get oil in her lamp
[2:46:33] going to p her
[2:46:36] through persecution
[2:46:40] in there. He puts them
[2:46:44] tribes
[2:46:45] right in there for the same thing
[2:46:50] and p them during the time of
[2:46:52] tribulation
[2:46:56] because it is perching.
[2:47:00] It's just the judgment.
[2:47:03] And look here
[2:47:06] comes up the 144,000
[2:47:10] 144,000
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; after the pag.
[2:47:13] And here comes
[2:47:15] also the sleeping vision
[2:47:20] comes up
[2:47:23] and has wide robes
[2:47:26] perfect
[2:47:30] is
[2:47:33] here.
[2:47:34] Amen. Let's close our eyes.
[2:47:41] Mighty heavenly father, thank you for
[2:47:43] this message.
[2:47:45] Thank you Lord.
[2:47:48] &gt;&gt; If there is anything here
[2:47:52] which Satan has tried to rob me,
[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; which have gone out of my mouth
[2:47:58] wrongly
[2:48:01] should never get into the hearts of your
[2:48:03] children.
[2:48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; To disturb them.

[2:48:11] one that can stay

[2:48:19] group of people

[2:48:34] already ready.

[3:00:55] Blessed Lord, heavenly father,
[3:00:59] we are indeed grateful, my lord,
[3:01:03] there is none like thee, father,
[3:01:07] thank you for your word.
[3:01:09] &gt;&gt; We go home a happy pupil.
[3:01:13] You have done it again, my God.
[3:01:16] &gt;&gt; We give you all the honor and all the
[3:01:18] glory.
[3:01:24] David says, "From everlasting to

[3:01:32] &gt;&gt; We have searched
[3:01:35] all the world over

[3:01:45] brought your word unto us
[3:01:48] &gt;&gt; and
[3:01:50] Hallelujah.
[3:02:05] And above all,

[3:02:15] that pattern
[3:02:17] &gt;&gt; and we just want to raise our hands and
[3:02:20] say thank you for your amazing grace.
[3:02:26] The question that we have
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; that we should be part
[3:02:34] of that pattern.
[3:02:40] You are concerned about us, oh God. And
[3:02:43] all the time you bring the message that
[3:02:46] is relevant that put us back into the
[3:02:50] pattern.
[3:02:52] Thank you Lord for the pattern because
[3:02:54] that pattern is the rapture. It is the
[3:02:58] elected.
[3:03:00] Oh,
[3:03:05] &gt;&gt; it's not an easy thing to come and
[3:03:08] address your people. He takes a special
[3:03:11] anointing. May you continue to bless him
[3:03:14] and speak through him. My God,
[3:03:25] the professor as much calls him. He has
[3:03:29] done the work. We love him also. May you
[3:03:33] continue to bless him wherever he's
[3:03:36] seated. Oh God,
[3:03:39] right at this very moment, we say, Lord,
[3:03:42] we salute you. We thank you. We thank
[3:03:46] you for him. We thank you for his life,
[3:03:48] oh God, wherever he is sitting right
[3:03:50] now, smiling as we know him, oh God, we
[3:03:54] say
[3:03:56] thank you for the life of our pastor
[3:03:59] because we are what we are. We are who
[3:04:02] we are because of him, oh God. Here
[3:04:08] is a few. My God, they are coming in.
[3:04:12] Oh, the pastor says it must be through
[3:04:14] the baptism.
[3:04:22] This is the promise that you have given
[3:04:25] because
[3:04:29] they had to come through the waterway.
[3:04:43] Amen.
[3:04:46] [Applause]
[3:04:54] Acts chapter 2 from verse 36-39.
[3:04:59] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[3:05:01] know assuredly that God hath made that
[3:05:03] same Jesus, whom he have crucified, both
[3:05:07] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[3:05:10] this, they were pricricked in their
[3:05:12] heart, and said unto Peter, and to the
[3:05:14] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[3:05:17] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[3:05:20] them, "Repent and be baptized every one
[3:05:23] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[3:05:25] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[3:05:28] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[3:05:31] the promise is unto you and to your
[3:05:33] children, and to all that are a far off,
[3:05:36] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[3:05:38] call.
