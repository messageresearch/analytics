Title: The Revealed Time of The Son of Perdition
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 28 May 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

Gen 19: 27 - 28   Gen 18: 17

God showed Abraham the thing he was to do in Sodom before hand. And today he shows the seed of Abraham the things he will do before tribulation.

Abraham knew that to see Sodom and Gomorrah he had to go stand on a place where he stood before the Lord. 

When the seals where opened the prophet said let us go apast the curtain of time. The message that is operating in the bride is the message from before time.

The bride will not see the tribulation from here, but she will see it from above.

The Pastor also reads the following scriptures and quotations:
Rev 12: 10 - 12     Gen 13: 14

we need to sit down and then just lecture ourselves I remove the lecturer in recovery actually foreign [Music] looking from a place looking from the place yeah below let me not take time and looking from the place now we'll continue and with the same title title all right and be with me I've got plenty of things here while I'm talking I'm trying to separate things [Music] okay let's let's read the scriptures that will be it's the same scripture Genesis 19 27 to 28. it's about my mother's 19 27 28 and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord and he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plane and beheld and low the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace was rich and okay let's leave it there for a while we come to the second afterwards foreign but let me just say Eric since you know you will we won't belong but looking from the place you look at the you know Abraham and his seed yeah you remember how even live by Pink tits in Abraham Island so it's Abraham okay Abraham and the Seed lipping of Abraham no drowning God showed him foreign which is typed here if you look at the time of the time of Abraham today our time today where are we what are we facing now which day are we facing [Music] now if God at that time showed Abraham at that time because now our time also here has arrived and wherever this Abraham there's the seeds Abraham is your faith If Abraham was promised amen If Abraham saws what about the seed now because here is the Seed of Abraham right now and the tribulation period is coming all right amen now I'll take this in this spiritual manner what about today [Music] because the tribulation that is coming was typed there is [Music] but there's one thing that God said in the in his words when he said before really Abraham saw that day sort of Sodom Corps are we together amen amen God said shall I hide from Abraham that is verse Genesis chapter 18 verse 17 yeah just read that part and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do that that is before is that before he saw Yes I mean that that's that's what that's what he was going to do I mean I understand he said shall I hide from Abraham Abraham the thing which I do no he could not the Lord Jesus himself he he took not the form of Ages if then at that time he showed he showed Abraham and in this last days there is this Seed of Abraham Abraham which before something happens Before Destruction strikes the world he will show to he will show today [Music] that's what what happened what is going to happen it's happening now all right now now because now is the last days you will realize that um from back then before the foundation of the world God knowing all this up to even this morning and even the coming days in his mind he had a plan and now last we read we have read from this Abraham knew very well that he could not see uh from where he was to to to to take uh to go to the place the Bible says [Music] God said to Moses she said go together that was before who's that man before Pharaoh arrives because of pharaoh was an underworld so God said are you ghosted by the river yeah [Applause] right there at home to come here to yourself if then we will start off now today and we are also looking from the place I will tell you that if it is the last days Billy you know that is you have the first and the last amen now to see the last fellow you should have seen it from the face okay amen now because Abraham Abraham being the seed of God now understand the first thing he knew foreign [Applause] foreign where God supernaturally displayed what he was going to do amen amen and there he has put us on track now it is on track of something he has already showed us okay now I'm talking to this amen let's look it like that you're funny foreign [Music] Church John says Cody John chapter 4. revelation 4. Revelation chapter 4. verse one one two two after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show the things which must be here after amen right amen I will show you things which must be here really after okay Church ages I don't know if you have seen that that's why we are no longer in the church because coward is a thing of the paste you can see it from there you must come to the place where you'll be able to see what comes you also have seen it the ministry is a Ministry after the church not during the church that is [Music] now I will take it from here for a few minutes and then now we are going to at the End of Time the people living in the end times the bride of Christ the children of God takes about time now [Music] [Music] now the message that we is operating in the bride of Christ is a message from before let me quote you something here [Music] in DC sorry for my books things sticking out and you know I'm busy reading these books all right let me quote you something the old battle that started way back Beyond Time yeah yeah this is something that buffers buffers not to read the pride of Grace okay [Music] have you ever heard you now and that means if maybe we have taught on that or we have preached it hasn't yet find it foreign and you are now arriving on this spot after the the opening of the series You Came From Beyond time now coming through the church but after the church it puts you now [Music] now it puts you beyond time in the church ages but what the prophet says that started before times foreign amen where are we there together more from Beyond Time amen so we went through amen amen that's why the message is not the seventh Church ages now the battle started way back Beyond Time backwards Before Time begins then Satan and his angels were kicked out they come to the earth and the battle set in again I'll show you why the people can't see this battle of armagedia because he started men cannot see that if he was not there Beyond time let's take it like this let me finish foreign uh the Bible doesn't say Michael killed them no I he says he he overcome them and send them down to the Earth he didn't kill them and then so they continue because that is their nature so they started again to continue now I think you will see this now when the the battle started here on Earth it was not by some other people by the same people never we are still those people why the people cannot see this battle foreign foreign foreign amen but what is Mystery is say healing stupa uh you won't even understand when talking about the battle of Armageddon again you have part of it is that right let me finish reading uh because I I I have planned not to stand for a long time the old battle that started way back and Satan and his Angel was were kicked out and then they come to the earth and the battle set in again okay now usually uh that's why uh if the battle started in the mind that means only those who are registered as the army they know they will they will know about this battle of form again but they were registered already now the reason even now they will be there will be no answer because because and Satan and his angels were kicked out and they come to the Earth the battle set in again and then they come all right and the battles sit in a gate because if broke down the barrier ever from where she was foreign [Music] one of God's subjects let down the bus and that's exactly how Satan has won the battle Island has been because one of his subjects from the wage amen amen yeah now really why not the people even now are quiet who are actually they are registered Army Satan are here again to fight Satan amen [Applause] Satan will be over overcome by the people who overcame [Applause] amen amen let me tell you something we are here I I don't know how many thousands of kilometers away from brother gableson yeah from like a brother means but yet we are in contact foreign [Music] so it doesn't take kilometers you get now because of this is a Ministry of the theophany you've met us not how far you are but when ethio funny speaks they can they hear the things all right amen now that's why it is the word of God is a body subject to the way okay that's why I will finish with this now that's why we are meeting now it matters not you are in Australia but when another few funny speaks yeah amen amen and so that is what is happening today look I can't drain any church I belong to that great one um [Music] let me come to this now we realize we are still coming with something there's opening of the seals it is [Applause] now any other form of life can never catch amen foreign but actually who is looking at that I could not see it unless it is you are reading about it I'm talking about seeing it because Abraham saw it foreign foreign that was something else the Lord has showed us in the Bible we have seen that is going to be this there's a time when you need to see it like Abraham amen amen and I know I'm going to see it happen but now this time I won't be standing right now we should be standing where we stood with the Lord to see what is coming because me to to see it burning that's when I was that's when I am beyond I'll read it to you that we will see it from somewhere else when the bride goes up [Music] [Applause] that that that that's the difference now let me pass this yeah that's why I'm saying the very very same people who who was engaged anymore those beings is the very same beings because amen the Battle Is Gonna afford is going to be fought after say it tribulation okay let's leave it there and that is after time that is after time I mean this very same battery now why they think people are quiet it is because it will be fought not this side of the rock is pardon meat on that other side of the eruption are you are you with me oh no let us put this thing like Arabian habits the Battle of Amadeus comes after the tribulation period it's here on the Earth the thing uh our tribulation period comes after the rap camera so the battle also comes after yeah we are on track now the tribulation periodication comes after the Rapture the battle foreign the rapture now anything that is coming after the Rapture can only be seen by your three or five do you wanna failure your side your your side your mind you can read about it all those things but because they are coming after you can only read about it amen all right I'm trying to say something right now let me look into the book okay um Abraham stood before the Lord now because we are in this end times we are going to look now from the original place this a beloved book which we call Hebrews now in my my Hebrew Book is an old one my my beloved friend brother retief gave it to me amen amen I believe we will meet one day we are going to meet Beyond Time let me read something to you the Sun that is pitched four three three in this vision it says the son that was with the father in the beginning was the logos that went out of God you know we'll we'll look at the original anointing logos and out of the logos amen if you're funny that was the original and win out of God that is the man that was the Genesis before Genesis because it's like this you have Genesis in in the beginning that is Genesis God created foreign speaks about creation that is the beginning of Genesis but the beginning of June and says in the beginning but the beginning of Genesis and everything that was created yes we have read it shall come to the end amen amen amen we have read it everything that was created shall come true that's why it is your body that was created but the soul was not created foreign uh perform again into the uh a creation which even now all of us here we know that um there is an Undertaker somewhere [Music] he has taken the measurements foreign foreign uh taken measurements of me and greedy measurements amen amen level is a pastor this and I mean when they say no you know he's the pastor he's one one yeah he says no no but his box is this one this is gaskets yeah [Music] coffee coffee working on their body's coffin now the brother introduce you introduced a person oh come on okay let it let us read now have you had me of this world will come to an end and only Jesus will remain amen is coming to the end and I read you know Hebrews here it says okay let me read for you the son that was with their father in the beginning was the logos that went out of God and it was the theophany of God went out the human form that didn't have eyes like you see yeah even is [Music] enjoy you can see the Rapture you can see the tribulations with this Natural Ice all right amen now see the human okay let me start and it was a few funny of God you know the seven colors of rainbows became okay your life but let's go on and it was the theophany of God went out the human form that didn't have eyes like you see English that's why Ibraham for him to see the actual thing in Sudan he had to really a camera come to ways to foreign foreign sometimes I look you see it there maybe somebody posting you just say oh poor faculty about where are you going listen challenge Abraham oh I'm reading and it was the fear for you of God that went out out the human form even if you're funny have eyes like you see yeah it is that all yeah that's why you see the seven series [Applause] [Music] thank you that was yourself but yourself was God funny that is yourself the way now that's why the gospel now your father amen I I sometimes read the letters is it a letter or what you call them my brothers the names what do you call them comments the people that are responsible but you can't understand what I'm saying what do you call these things the thing that you are reading [Music] comments let's leave it there let's leave it there when reading this from my brothers then I realized that they are thousands and thousands of kilometers away what is happening here when it comes to the original things you realize that when I preach here my brother out there amen amen is the body give me it is his body is here in the city you see amen that's why Always I've got their comments put together [Music] we're talking with the brother that we are going to bind them together and to have them I don't know in heaven whether we will there will be a time when we will be asked to to testify now we must testify now wonderful things are happening now okay let's let's read it again and it was the theophany of God and the out of the logos and so you were a CEO Fighters if you are understanding now let me reach and it was the theophany of God that went out what God we have read that one what God makes or or what happens what do you have what God makes is off oh God yeah amen if God it's something else Jesus that's why you you were not created but your body was created [Applause] now what came forth out of God [Music] and that's why he says you have eternal life just like God and then he says came from the same place [Applause] hey if only you could see I'm okay can you see yourself [Applause] I I read I continue let us not again and it was the theophany of God that went out the human form in it that didn't have eyes like you see but a better eyes and that all these rainbows condescended into a field foreign I'm in you see what what what's actually is men now that's why the Bible says what is and all that was God oh that God thought of chocolate all that God made it was to make a man in his own um [Music] there is the one that is created is your body give me that's right that's why we are not the same others creation yeah amen we are not the same huh amen creation Motorola one one is angry one doesn't love that one um that's why it says that was created oh man yeah when we came in those times at the back there I found them singing saying yeah let me reach the rainbow because it is God was looked at as a rainbow we have read that everybody so now actually but as brother Brendan says into a few friends and out of God foreign [Music] food that's right we have the seven series if if you are still in a church age okay you can see outside from the church um and I will show you because the real side that God is responsible is when he shows you things to come here that's the side that you need okay okay to see things to come that's why Abraham Abraham would not see it while the Lord has told him that what he's going to do I mean possibly he said to the wife let me go and check I think time has arrived that's the thing that God has done [Music] that it is happening now let me just go back to the place amen amen Where I Stood before the Lord it was a special place just like the special place coming back to the end time to I mean to the ministry for special people you listen now no I mean you here Abraham Abraham it was not somebody or God never said all right go back there no that one that thing was already in him that's why we came from the denomination who told us it's something in US because we didn't belong there [Applause] amen amen okay as they think there is a big will turning in mind in my heart yeah I'm looking here to all right amen Abram saw him when he stepped down into human flesh [Music] um when Abraham was standing there hey he saw hello hello then he saw those that light coming down now that's why the prophet says he saw him coming into the body so Abram Abraham could have said to his wife because Sarah was just as predestinated as Abraham Abraham that was something both predestinated just to show Christ they came from the same place Christ and the bridge so we will come we are coming to that how their marriage is going to be like okay wait for us and we will come to the to the marriage okay I read another scripture says the Seed of Abraham they started off looking for their promises and they saw it a pharaoh now they started working towards that the Bible says they saw it just like us all right now let's look at this the rainbow condescended into a theophile and God Made You Bet Your fight like the revelation of the Seven Seas it's not something you uh you are struggling from asking that one do you believe that a series do you believe that the seven series because the seals we thought the seven is incomplete but we will come to look into it why God omitted amen amen but we'll come and see all right now I'm trying to I'm I'm down coming with something here The Rainbow condescended into a theophy no that's why it does is it doesn't say I feel funny you know that what happened with you congratulations [Music] otherwise you'd be saying that is not revealed unless it condescended into you then it becomes just a human thing you'll be going around asking now what are you saying in your church is it revealed says it's not something what are you saying that that's how God anointed that how the anointing was [Music] seven colors of rainbows your family you get whatever no our this is what happened into the bread of Christ all that God was Christian that is the real anointing he himself all that God was we have read that last time [Music] if you can't believe that yeah I don't know all right amen I'm carrying one for a few minutes yeah may the Lord bless you hey I I believe I've already seen things here and I believe we are going to see things we've got it line up all right amen let me finish and the rainbow condescended now you know how that's how the anointing was like this it was not that we are going to the upper room to wait for the Holy Ghost and so forth foreign you're funny that was the anointing is very same rainbow you are not a rainbow yeah Moses saw it when so it when it passed through the rocks said it it looked like a man is now unlike you know issue talking about the baptism of the Holy ghosts the this one what happened there before there was any Genesis all right amen then it continues Moses saw it it looked like a man you know that form s and Abraham Abraham saw him um when he stepped into human form all right amen that's how I I see the message and you can pick up the man to be the seventh angel messenger unless you saw something foreign oh just like you can show you yeah it will happen to you the same way John was standing there he knew that he was supposed to introduce the Messiah he just stood today but he heard he knew he's going to introduce [Music] just as you know that we are going in the rapture [Applause] he's going to introduce the Messiah then he just stood there because he couldn't go to Bible School foreign it then he saw me are born which started as like a dove yeah and John started to follow him away [Music] that's why how he introduced himself to you it was the logos in the beginning was that is the beginning I'm going back before the beginning really harm at all the beginning is introduced by Genesis of the beginning of Genesis before the beginning how was it before the beginning seven colors of the rainbow of the rainbow amen yeah all right amen but the thing is when when time has set in then you couldn't see that you're fine a he came up the beginning because God had in his mind for their life time yeah then he calls it in the beginning because now this is the end of the beginning [Music] in the beginning God created and everything that was created yeah I'm also created by God yes but the creation continuity creation creation everything is but what was created [Music] [Applause] all right yes that's why we are still continuing because we were not created at all the person that is continuing now is the one that was not created [Applause] because we are not through we are coming all right I mean there is some something here what else is now we are facing three and a half years three and three and here it is we've looked we looked at it last week the one of Christ three and a half years amen amen he prophesied no what was left now is the three and a half years Lucifer porno is looking at it and we can see the signs the people don't see this they only keep on saying hey in that country they don't don't even want you to sing Come Lord Jesus Christians have been harassed everywhere you are seeing it they don't want the people the people who used to preach on the streets I'm not being arrested for the name of Jesus the countries you thought they were Christians are now arresting the Christians it is happening right now yes we say with its uh I I read again what is happening let me tell you something I can say to you the Lord is coming very soon foreign [Music] it is what you have ahead if there's a stock of wheat or wheat hello that's why if you take the wheat off with the seat what remains there's no more life foreign who is not actually predestinated but if you are a child of God even if you can go that far Our God will still follow me come and save my son my daughter amen amen it's like the Lord Jesus Christ let's say God and he made uh what do you call it with Israel a covenant now Covenant binds him even if Israel can go away but God will still come back because of the Quran that's what we that's what's happening to Us closing listen but not finished the the the the men no no no no no now the men of sin that's what we are
