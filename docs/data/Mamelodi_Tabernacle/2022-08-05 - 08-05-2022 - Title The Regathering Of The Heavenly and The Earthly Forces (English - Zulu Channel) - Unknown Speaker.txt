sending to attack in this room father god i pray we cast them out in the name of jesus satan you've got no place here take your things and go out here in jesus name i pray amen hallelujah you laughed

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah our god is so good and so great and so powerful he has a name above all names just [Music] there is no power that can spend when that name is called and we are here to call upon his name to have the control over any power hallelujah if there is a god in heaven that god [Music] all the powers are under control this morning and if you are here and you have been troubled this is a time and a moment where you can confess your peace your deliverance your change your blessing then you receive it this morning [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] as i may request the brothers to prepare the pasta so that we can welcome him in the perfect i know you know i before everything i would like to start by acknowledging all the mothers in the building so wish you a happy mother's day [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] my prophet says there is not enough honor to give to a mother i am speaking to real true and good mothers you know i always say the mother has got an ability that no one can have here on earth god has given to them a special a special gift a special ability which is to develop the seed to give it a shape and bring it to achievement i thought i would hear amen and that's a man cannot do that you need a mother to do that that's why prophecy she's so precious because she give a sense to life and the life will not have any sense unless there is a man all great men of history of this world if there is a credit to give to their life it is to their mothers you want to be successful in life honor the good mother that god has given to you amen [Music] isaac did not know the secret but rebecca knew the secrets isaac the prophet even called for issue to bless you though was the prophet but rebecca had a secret from god and she went behind it i see the prophet becoming serious [Music] but this is the bible rebecca knew the secret and she told the jacob what your father said is not that said alone [Applause] there's a is behind that if moses could become the great deliverer it's because of their mother and the missionary age of the open door of john wesley was because of his mother and if there is a credit to give to great men today because there was a good woman behind i am saying that this morning for you mothers to understand what is the responsibility that god has given unto you and i love and appreciate you this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] may god bless you richly and receive the best of your life god bless you pastor amen this is my father amen you know when i see you i'm stronger person so it is you know we have so much to say but our pastor is here we will hand over to him we want him to speak you know when i want to hear serious things you know what i want to sit i always say i love preaching i don't hear just any preacher you can't just tell me sit down i want to preach to you it's not easy for me they are people when i see them i feel like sitting down and listen [Music] hallelujah and this morning i'm here to sit down and listen because if god wants to speak to you god will not pick a tree and bring it here and make the wings and start saying my son hear my voice [Music] god will take a man god will put on a suit [Applause] amen unfortunately the only way god can speak to us is true amen [Music] [Applause] sometimes people they want to hear god they want to see a dream they want to see all those sort of things but i believe if god loves you he speaks to you behind the prophet and you say amen [Applause] [Music] hallelujah so this morning you know as we were going through thinking of the things that the lord has done for us to thank him to say lord we thank you jesus speaks about the parables of those 10 lepers people that were prayed for and a group left and never came back but another group came back and said thank you the bible say be thankful unto the lord for one yesterday count what the lord has done amen and every time you are counting what the lord has done i remember the people that the lord is used to do good unto you sometimes when we go around and think of those people we like to call them around us to show unto them our life because it's not just by speaking just by saying it must be our actions we call them around and say let's come and sit down together and remember the goodness of the lord and that's why we are here and we thought that our pastor should come and bless us and we thank him always for his availability and the love that he has shown unto us living in a difficult world where people reject one another people dislike one another people betray one another but when you find somebody who loves you you need to value that you need to appreciate you need to express your appreciation because god loves that to see somebody who can appreciate the lord has blessed us with a wonderful gift in this land and he has been a great help us in the ministry in past all these years we have been together in the field fighting the enemy taking the gospel further in the hearts of the people and we are so thankful to the lord that he has kept him and inspiring him more and more and filling his heart with so many good things when he speaks there is just so many good things that comes out and i believe you are going to be blessed i want you to stand on your feet as we going to welcome the pastor there is this song that i love to sing when i am with him i don't know if the brothers will get the right key for me [Music] it was a prophecy it was a prophecy now description is [Music] hallelujah [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is foreign [Music] [Applause] hmm ah hmm can you hear me our enemy was defeated by micah and was cast down to the earth can you hear me can you hear me i can't hear myself okay so as i greet the church saints in the name of our lord jesus christ it says when the seals were open john got so heavy he know says time we went on this subject is my name there that was my name he opened the book when because the name is in that book [Music] yeah our pastor has already prepared the menu this is subscribe and i asked brother did the pastor really say and mention that [Applause] for a long time shepherds we are glad to be with you this morning now i'm going to read the word of god is gonna bless us yesterday although i couldn't make it here you know we are we don't care what the world says joshua is the man who came with a responsibility [Music] we should read the word of god and we've got the two scriptures to read we believe by the blessings of our pastor here is your prayers maybe you should close your ears to this what i'm going to do i yesterday yeah [Music] from you know you remember that so we agent diversity they were doing some things not knowing that was on our site amen we are here to worship the victory [Music] amen no satan is going to stand here today i know you go [Music] and now we want to read the scriptures turn down another horse our heavenly father thank you for this supernatural moment we are here lord god this morning to come to worship you and you we know there was a time when this would come before you and satan also would come and they will challenge satan and say where are you from and he said from the earth i was going up and down breaking churches that is his duty and you said but there is one man there is a one man that is job of my servant have you seen that man that is job my servant he's then in that form he challenged satan with a man he had a man to challenge she turned with that was job and said you can take whatever you take from job but don't touch his spirit because the spirit is mine so lord we are here this morning to worship thee and satan knows also we are here this morning to worship god god satan's people know we are here this morning to worship god and then we are going to worship god god bless you as we pray in jesus christ's name amen as if we may read the scriptures mentioned the pale halls revelation chapter 6 verse 7 to 8 the white horse revelation 19 11-21 and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast saying come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that said when he was dead and helpful with him and i saw heaven opened and behold and he of kings and lord of lords and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god that we may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of catholic and the flesh of mighty baby and the flesh of horses and of them and the flesh and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathering together to make war against him that set on the is [Music] our pastor sang that song [Music] on our side to my case is you know yesterday when i was phoned from here they were yesterday on our site yes we're is so we started from there because the battle of armageddon i'm not going back to you there but the battle of armageddon is is the final showdown which it started with a battle in heaven brother is even in the scriptures [Music] today i don't know what to do with is [Music] and according to the sign all the signs are pointing to the rapture zonkey zimbabwe was a we see already the tribulation period is starting to manifest is a tool in the hand of god [Music] he will destroy america now being manifested into a profiting as a sister he keep one we've got a pile of this files at home watch watch russia right now because everything is manifesting okay now here is our subject here which is to to bless us always what is jesus and he speaks of the regathering of the heavenly and the earthly fossils [Music] [Music] is when i go through lungs you remember i i i think you you've got your quotation there [Music] muscles he was lifted up from the church ages [Music] you couldn't see those things uh there is things here and then you know as when the seals were open is imposed excited let the pastor preach alone let us go past the cutting of time mercy folding guidelines amen amen now if you go past the curtain of the battle of armageddon tribulation period now if it comes after that religion what is what says bring it engaged in that battle to come which but then let us read these things here we are going to take the two in heaven and on earth together a good foundation for that secondly ephesians chapter 1 go backwards a bit according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love right chosen before the foundation now the message these things they were there that which was from the beginning you say i'm into it [Music] receive the seventh let us play our now this is good now this is not for an on karma all right let me say something hold on there i'm coming and they were uh you will understand i'm repeating that because because i'm preaching today a few families i was that which was from the beginning which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the weight of life amen amen which hence brother which eyes back there with the theophaniest [Music] is and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us and assure unto you the greatest because it is from there [Music] all about what it was [Music] is [Music] we let us go to this one and one horse is now if you read here it says is where of [Music] and in righteousness he don't judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many tongues and he had a name written that no man knew but being himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god amen and what followed you and then heaven followed him upon white horses and the army which was where this is [Applause] and i could yes what is this all coming to you [Music] he says there's two armies one from heaven you'll see the other one being gathered they can't make it back to heaven as we are doing the we are on the final the first thing in heaven was a battle that is in this book is page 282 uh seals acres in 282 so lucifer was kicked out he's been polluting ever since deception [Music] now you watch this process [Music] is i asked a girl they know they know how these people come to my house [Music] we went to and what was that some kinds of documents but there's there's is a girl came to my house is is [Music] prevented from getting into the yard of the tabernacle i was told no we challenged satan to come in they say to me he's on our um is later [Applause] by ambulances which was adam and god [Music] open now [Applause] [Music] then when the lord god comes jesus comes jesus the son of man return back where he was before [Applause] the christians [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] m [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know when you are talking to an army because i am addressing an army foreign confusion it's still like that today satan was knocked down satan you are weak to apparently amen and isaiah saw him who is uh this one this one this one i told this one yes a great wonder in heaven a woman throws with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a count of 12 stars and she being with child christ travailing in bath and pains to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a roll of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throne and the woman fled into the world god bless you sir uh how many stars 12 stars is verse one to see isabelle 12 verse 1 to 6 12 stars in kanye's easiest in your hebrew you know yeah i've got it here no i don't need that we will use it if we need it this that's is i i want to follow the prophet here this one is it shows how [Music] is these are the powers they also they don't run short of armaments because they are helicopters ours are their brooms bananas is we came across some big loaves of brown bread they are ambassadors something like a 45 minutes will be what he goes over 45 minutes services figgy and they said because we are using that bread you know we are the savings this is [Applause] as long as you don't start eating that airbus will arrive in the same way okay here it is no you know why why brethren i why here here i'm free here there are some places where they don't want you to mention the word another word [Music] so possibly yeah man you expect the last thing to be a better one lucifer was kicked out it's a time and he's still going to be kicked down she showed her pants the bottomless pit mm-hmm polluted you know yeah even yesterday pastor i was dealing with something even yesterday and then satan says amen and then sometimes they will go for a child we say scottish versus that for you to get money he wasn't totally mad to become this place was no longer found in heaven and from the battle in heaven on earth it is to be finished everybody knows that and now he will be pushed further down pusha lopez and when they did drop right down in eden michael and his angels [Music] is he knows that he is uh [Applause] okay um they didn't they didn't roll and drop they started [Music] yes [Music] if you respect god and fear god god will respect [Applause] ah is he is with you [Applause] all the time [Applause] [Music] and he said what tell them moses said to them what to do [Applause] i told the church as a all right all right wait until i read to you okay is okay well let me look at this first eating period because we are coming to the incarnation reincarnation [Music] um have you seen caleb let us take them [Applause] caleb can't you see these giants then they brought the good news today we need the people sometimes just fool about before and bring that to the church here the church ages we are coming to things so that will be here after now what faculty do you need to see things that will be hereafter because church ages is time time you don't see what is beyonce and after the seven church ages that's right [Music] you [Music] revelation 21 verse 9. what did he say read brother there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vows full of the seven of the seven last weeks and talked with me saying come heather i'll show thee the bright alexander [Applause] m either came [Applause] [Applause] um abraham that who is this till today they can't see him because he says he came as a prophet [Music] he's a man and then when abraham looked at there was a time when drawn the world but when [Music] eating drinking like men is how do you recognize your own pastor who is i don't recognize a pastor because you know in denomination you recognize him when he has a diploma a certificate this one [Applause] are you sure [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] when it [Music] oh [Music] says he saw that light in the world he followed the light wasani movement [Applause] not because somebody says he is all right let me arrive friend few minutes we are here mr swan now let me read it to you i'll leave this because it says satan will now become a king and then you'll see how the two forces use together revelation chapter 12 speak of this issue firstly where is my book here you want me well the greatest battle ever fought there i'm going to read you a scripture here but let me start here um an army first in getting ready for a battle every time when you come to service you know that you are going to oma we are in consumers and i have recognized the enemy already [Music] i believe that greatest battle that ever thought is now ready to go on in action i believe that god has been selecting his soldiers but is now set getting ready to start i will read you later where the prophet says don't you think of measures and whatever [Music] the great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven yes if somebody owes you money don't think it it is the battle of armageddon [Music] if somebody hates you momentary the armaments that the lord has given me is currently um [Music] [Applause] sometimes a person will come to church go backwards abandon [Music] you are okay the one with christ [Music] i can hear you now and then it was this battle was thrown down from heaven we have read it to the earth amen are you with then the battle from angels human battles meaning it is continuing is [Music] know it is still that badly it's a young pillar i don't mean fighting your neighbor that is not the battle of armageddon one day [Music] then they would go to church and do [Music] to destroy we have just read that when this battle started on earth there had to be a mission meeting place please in [Music] there must be it is you must be dressed up finally okay we are living in this time when even your fellow sister brother brother sister amen would it come to you as a devil worshiper [Music] it they were trying to destroy the conference in malawi they were trying to do that the pastor's wife was put in a hospital who first come from this world to be operated i said i have got a witness i told witness is here [Applause] amen and the way there is these things there is more blessings [Applause] where there's a faith and fire reference when is um [Applause] [Music] so it started now in the economy in the human mind since ever in the human mind [Music] from some organization they never started from that organization they could be a better like today i'm not going to church [Music] [Music] minds that's where satan meets you away and i was told about this sister of mine [Music] foreign [Applause] oh okay [Applause] after she has lost to the bed sometimes when you start the chorus check first right [Applause] [Music] because we must pick up this from heaven from earth physically starting now there's a trinity on this side brother taught me that you can win war with a first and second pool there you go one more first and second place they were in the wilderness at the sight of pharaoh [Music] and god said to moses because it is the lord god who has already opened the way foreign [Music] is [Applause] [Applause] that's right because if you worship oh my god don't come to the third finger you always start you are still looking behind you are still coming forward hmm [Music] open up again [Applause] [Music] [Applause] anointed [Applause] for adam to come back before [Applause] your place [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] now okay that's right now the highway and the way and where you're behind me for the highway we are walking
