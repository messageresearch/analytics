[1:31:34] D
[1:31:35] verse 5. can you continue ladies I think
[1:31:41] Kings chapter 2 verse 5. and the sons of
[1:31:44] the prophets that were at Jericho came
[1:31:46] to Elijah and said unto him know as thou
[1:31:50] that the Lord will take away thy master
[1:31:52] from thy heads today and he answered
[1:31:56] yeah I know it
[1:31:58] is and
[1:32:09] no it's down that that we are the Lord
[1:32:13] will take away thy Master Duty from thy
