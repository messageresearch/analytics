Oh, &gt;&gt; without wasting time, I'll go straight to the scriptures. I would like us to read the book of Hebrews. &gt;&gt; Uh chapter 11. We'll read the first verse &gt;&gt; and the sixth verse. Hebrews chapter 11 verse one. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; Verse six, but without faith it is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; Okay, brother Peter, can you lead us in prayer? Most gracious eternal heavenly father once more this morning we are gathered in this place we are standing on holy ground lord this place is not for everyone oh god this is the place where our elder Israel stood morana now we have our elder that the kosana standing this morning lord we want hear from your God. &gt;&gt; We don't want to hear from people, but we want to hear from the father. &gt;&gt; We want it to be from heart to heart. &gt;&gt; Because that's what makes the difference, oh God. &gt;&gt; Lord, may our hearts burn as you speak unto us with your word. Your word has been read, oh God. May you bless it, oh God. Anoint it, oh God. Give it the inspiration that when we go out of this place, we will not be the same. Oh God, we shall give you all the honor and all the glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Okay. Before I give you the title, I just want you to be settled. because I know maybe some of you might think that I might say some things that are out of order. No, I'm old enough. I will never say anything that would disturb me. &gt;&gt; One day I was with a pastor and not brother but his father. There was a pastor that was preaching, not pastor, another pastor. And then that pastor said, what you consumed. &gt;&gt; And the pastor looked at me &gt;&gt; and then he shook his head. &gt;&gt; This man does not know that these are souls in your life. You must never do what these people years back. So &gt;&gt; and he will stand behind this pulpit. &gt;&gt; But these are the souls of God. &gt;&gt; When you speak to them, know that you're speaking to the souls of God. He will say, "Okay, as a pastor, I have to straighten the church. But you people, you are just preachers. I the pastor will say some things to straighten the church. So ours is just to uplift the church and then the pastors will be the one Maybe that will say some things that might surprise you. We we'll just go to the scriptures and teach you what the scriptures and edify the church. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I just want you to be settled along those line. I know that you've heard lot of things. I won't talk about those things. May the Lord bless you all. &gt;&gt; Now my title here is a quickening spirit. &gt;&gt; Quickening spirit. We we are talking about rapture that is around the corner &gt;&gt; and then uh there are promises that are leading towards the rapture. The last message that the pastor preached The title was man has lost his image. I don't know whe they still remember that right now. There are some promises that God gave us of which we need to believe them. and we need to faithfully believe them. That's why uh uh the first verse that I've read, it has to do with faith. It says fa faith is a substance. Substance. &gt;&gt; Everybody knows that verse. Our Lord Jesus Christ said, "I will build my church." It &gt;&gt; It seems we don't believe that. Didn't say anybody else will build it. He said himself will build his church. &gt;&gt; And if we can just believe that who will stop running around because it's himself that will build it. &gt;&gt; Uh in uh the sixth verse &gt;&gt; or let's start from verse five. &gt;&gt; Verse five. Now here we're talking about the quickening spirit. Uh to quicken is to make alive. It's divine giving. Before the rapture, our bodies must change, right? Amen. We need to have a spirit that will change our bodies. Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; Otherwise, rapture &gt;&gt; it's not a story, it's lifeure. It's life that our body are going to change and it's a promise. that our body are going to change. &gt;&gt; But there's some events that have to uh uh trans we need to see. There's some promises and those promises will tell us how far is the rapture. We might not know the day. We might not know the hour. But there are signs. They will tell you the signs. You you will see by the signs that now things are become worse. He is always around the corner. &gt;&gt; When we worship God, we need to look at the events of how far are we, where are we, in which dispensation are we? And in that dispensation, are we in the middle or in the beginning or at the end? There are promises that will tell you that at the end there will be this and this. Then you look at those things. Then you will know where you are. Then you will settle down and concentrate and pray over those things. Now before the quickening of our body, there should be a squeeze. It's a promise. That's the pro prophet came with it. said that there's going to be a squeeze before our bodies change. Are we together? Now those promises are sort of highlight when you see reactions or or certain reactions. Those reactions tells you that it's time now of the transformation from physical to spiritual. Our bodies are going to change. But there are signs that needs to tell you promises pertaining to that. Now verse five. &gt;&gt; Verse five. What does it say? &gt;&gt; By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God hath translated him. For before his translation, he had his testimony that pleased God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see it says Enoch &gt;&gt; Enoch &gt;&gt; was translated. But what what translated him or what made him to be translated? Because the Bible says before his translation, he had this testimony that he pleased God. There are certain conditions that God placed that before you are translated, you have to go through this. You cannot be translated if you don't see far. If you see things vividly, you can't be translated. You have to understand and have a knowledge and be seasoned and grow spiritually that if something happens. You don't look a person. You look the other side. You look the spirit that is involved in &gt;&gt; and then you don't fight that person. I'm telling you, I'm a seasoned person. You fight that spirit that is hiding there, &gt;&gt; right? Otherwise, you're going to be disturbed because God wants you to please him. He has given you promises, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read the book of uh second Peter. The book of second Peter. Remember remember it says here before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God. Don't think that the devil and his demons will let will will let you go to heaven on a rocking chair. That's why the Bible says he that overcome. &gt;&gt; So there's something that need to happen. Each and every one of us have to overcome. You see, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham Abraham &gt;&gt; when he met me, &gt;&gt; it's after he overcame. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a ministry. Our ministry is the revelation of the seventh seal. Revelation of the seven. What is it? It's Christ himself. When he's in you in the form of the word and when he's in you in the form of the word that makes you Christ. That makes you cry. That makes you a minor God. Now being a minor God, you can call things the prophet says when he says the word is in the bride. He says the bride has got thus said the Lord. But he says he knows what to do. Thus said the Lord. He's not using it hazard. If God was haphazard, not even a single one of us will be alive by now. We were all born in sins. shaped in iniquity. We need to remember that. It is just by his grace. Any any power that we have, we should use it accordingly. When we speak about the power of the third P, when we speak about the revelation of the word, We speak about nothing else but Christ himself in the form of the way. And now if Christ came to you, let me put it like this. We will go to the scripture in the book of Ephesians chapter one. I think it verse you don't have to open it. You know it. The Bible speaks about the things in heaven. It speaks about the things here on earth. Says those that are in earth, they will go up. Those that are on heaven, they will come down. They will meet in Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, &gt;&gt; uh the prophet speaks about the two books, the book of life and the lamb's book of life. Says when you are born, you are born in the book of life and then from there on you are transferred to the lamb's book. Then he speaks about the the seed and the chuck. &gt;&gt; So when you plant this when you plant the seed, &gt;&gt; it germinates and on and on and on until it produce the seed itself. Then you separate the sh from the seat. Now the seed has got a life right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that life you cannot destroy it belongs to that seed. But that shark it life ends up when you harvest it. after harvesting the shark is useless. Now if one uh is uh from a god I mean if you are from God predestinated &gt;&gt; before the foundation there's nothing that you can do. There's nothing that somebody can do. &gt;&gt; You are that life. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So now if you are that life, you will know that you are that life. You won't jump around and try to do something. You know, you are the seed of God. You are not pretending. Okay, let's read the uh u &gt;&gt; first pet I mean second Peter &gt;&gt; second Peter &gt;&gt; chapter uh second Peter chapter &gt;&gt; 2 I want you to read verse four verse four &gt;&gt; chapter 1 verse4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. &gt;&gt; Now here &gt;&gt; Peter says &gt;&gt; he says uh whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises. &gt;&gt; Just remember that You are given. It's not you who produce that. It comes from God. You're given that &gt;&gt; and something that we are given. And he says &gt;&gt; uh they had given unto us all things sorry whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises. God cannot give you a promise and don't fulfill it. If he says he will build his church that is a promise he will fulfill. Are we together? Now if he says the word is in the bride is him the word is him in you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And remember he continues and says that by this you might be partakers of the divine nature. There is a nature that is divine and to have a divine nature, &gt;&gt; you must be quickened. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are promises that he gives you and with those promises, it's leading you to the quickening. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now you don't lead yourself. &gt;&gt; You don't try and shake yourself up. You were given those things. So might you might be partakers of the divine nature. It's a promise. He gives you if you want to be like me, &gt;&gt; here are the promise. That's what he gave Enoch &gt;&gt; and he looked at Enoch and he was happy about what he was doing that testimony and he was pleased and he gave us promises as his bride and we will walk according to those promises until we are raptured. How are we together? It's a promise. It comes from him. And he cannot say a thing that will never manifest. Whatever he says, it will be manifested. Amen. Let me say to you, this is not the time of trying to correct anybody. Look, the devil is very late. Are &gt;&gt; we together? The opening of a seven, finished up everything. So it's either you have crossed the line or we didn't cross the line but it finished up everything. This is the time of the manifestation of the scriptures that says, "Let he that is holy be holy still and let he is filthy. It's not time for correction. You cannot correct somebody that has crossed over. &gt;&gt; You can't bring him back. Look, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ after resurrection, &gt;&gt; he went back to heaven, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; He became a mediator. That was a time where somebody must repent. He &gt;&gt; he was a redeemer. Redeemer us with his blood. He was a mediator, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And after that when when he was a mediator, it was a messy seat. It was coming or coming &gt;&gt; right and when he stood up &gt;&gt; with a book now he's changing now a throne now and changing a seat now he's sitting now on a judgment seat now he's got a book and in that book is the lamb's book of life. All those that are found in that book will be called. Look, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; if you read, I think it's Revelation 2:1 17, &gt;&gt; it speaks about uh he that overcome. &gt;&gt; He said, I will make him eat a hidden man. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I will give him a stone which is a white stone and his name written in that stone and he will be the only one that knows about it. You will be the only one that knows about yourself. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you are wrong, you will know that you are wrong. If you are right, you will never be disturbed. You will continue. If you are filthy, there's nothing that you can do. Whatever you will try to do will portray who you are. Right? And if you are holy, whatever you're trying to do will portray who you are. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then we are given these promises that now by these we might be partakers of the divine nature. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So now in order that you should be transformed, you must have a testimony. &gt;&gt; Right? That's why we read that without faith it is impossible to please him. Right? Amen. I want to read a quote here from this book communion in paragraph 49. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 49. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says there was another William Brenham a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God. the word of God that was placed in there. Each one of you can think of similar things that now there was a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God. He says each one of you can think of similar things because if you read Romans 8, &gt;&gt; if you read verse 29 verse 29, &gt;&gt; read it my brother because we are doing what we are Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got it. Uh uh &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8 29 &gt;&gt; vers 29. &gt;&gt; For whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Now it says for whom he did for no. &gt;&gt; For no is God perfect knowledge. Uh God's perfect knowledge. God has got a knowledge and the knowledge is perfect. That is why now he says for whom he did for no also predestinated to be conformed. To be conformed is to behave according to the standard. uh the behavior &gt;&gt; that are expected we are conformed that's why we are talking about the quickening and then uh while we are speaking about the quickening spirit we're talking about the testimony that please God and those those testimony that please God must be confirmed. We have to behave according to the standard and that standard is our promises and then those promises are divine. God when he look at you, he look at you from a a divine mirror. You need to be conformed according to that standard, the divine mirror. Are we are we together? So then in encouraging you &gt;&gt; while you are uh waiting for the rapture remember that rapture is not a period. It's a twinkling of an eye. Rapture is not a period. You can not say rapture will start here and end. It's in a twinkle of an eye. Once it happened, you cannot straighten yourself up. So now they are a method, a behavior. Amen, and the standard &gt;&gt; that will conform you. Amen. Then in the book of terminology in paragraph 27, paragraph 27, whilst we are still under quickening spirit, while we are still talking about being partakers of divine nature, while we are still talking about the precious great promises, exceeding, &gt;&gt; precious, great promises. &gt;&gt; It's not just a a an ordinary promise. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Remember to be quickened is to make alive is to give you a divine nature. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now in in paragraph 27, &gt;&gt; listen to what the prophet says. &gt;&gt; Says, "But your souls were made up before the foundation of the world. Are we together? Your souls." That's why when I started here, I said, "You are the souls. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Being the souls ours is to give you scriptures to give you encouraging words. The one that doesn't want those things. You don't feed him with our own ideas. I was a preacher on the trains. training with the brother in the buses and things like that. And when it was my turn to preach, I was preaching like I'm preaching right now. Then brother Mia said to me, "You won't get even a single soul. You must tell them yeah their wrongs. Then I realized there that not I'm not an evangelist. Their language is not my language. Their way of doing things is not the way of doing. They will do that and people will just repent and be baptized. So but they'll be taken to the pastor and the pastor will conform them will talk nicely to them are we together. That is why even today they are still here because it says your your soul was made up before the foundation of the world. God created man in his own. You must remember, we have read that he for know you, for knew you and predestinated you and to be conformed, right? Amen. And then you bypass a certain stage in your life. Now he's reminding you about what you are uh what you have bypassed. And when you hear that you long to go home and you start follow up the Ruth and when you follow up the Ruth is why it says Enoch pleased God. the testimony that he had. He heard the word of God and realized that he was wrong and he follow a right path. You follow the right route. Are we together? Your souls are made before the foundation of the world. When God created man in his own, how are we together on the same book? &gt;&gt; Uh I I don't have the paragraph. It's just a page. Oh, paragraph 34. That's paragraph. &gt;&gt; Your souls were made up before the foundation of the world. I I realize I treat the people that's brother says when I treat the people I realize that their souls were made before the foundation. So when I'm treating them, when I'm treating I'm treating God says when he's treating you because your souls were made before the foundation of God, he knows that he's treating God. But just my attitude towards you is my attitude towards Christ and your attitudes toward me is the same thing. That's right. Are we together? &gt;&gt; I will just quote some other scriptures in my sermon. All my sermons, I always quote this scripture. I love it. John 6:63, &gt;&gt; you know it. You don't have to open it. It says, "It is the spirit that quickenth." The flesh profitth nothing. The words that I speak unto you, that is Jesus Christ. The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life. The words &gt;&gt; are spirit &gt;&gt; and they are alive. &gt;&gt; When you listen and then in in Isaiah &gt;&gt; I think it's 55. Isaiah 55 &gt;&gt; verse 11 &gt;&gt; verse 11 &gt;&gt; he says &gt;&gt; when my word come out of my mouth &gt;&gt; will never return void it will accomplish are we together amen now the accomplishment is to build the germinated the germinating person the the the men of the wheat, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the accomplishment when it come back, it has accomplished, it finds a place in a person and then because it's life, it gives that person life. That's why the Bible says I think it's proverb 8. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 8 and on verse 35 verse 35 &gt;&gt; said he that found me has found life because the word that I speak it is a spirit. We will go to that one. The word that I speak is a spirit and it is life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you read uh a quote here, &gt;&gt; I think it's uh let me get the book. Show us the father. &gt;&gt; And it suffices us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he says here, &gt;&gt; uh no. Yes. Yes. Let me start right on top. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let start on top there. It says, let me start paragraph 40. &gt;&gt; 40. &gt;&gt; Now let's take secondly quickly as we can get to it. &gt;&gt; God in his word says how many believe God God's in the universe. And then he said, "All right. You can see him in his universe. Let's let's see if he is in his weight. Then what I trust now with all my heart that God will quicken quicken. The word quicken now by his spirit. That's what he says. Then he he he gives an example about the swer that went out. So and then he explain it on and on on it. That is why in the book of Corinthians Bible says we should examine ourself to see whether we are of faith. Are we of faith? We believe the word of God as it is now. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you prove yourself whether you've got a rapturing faith in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. It continually said, "Know you not your own selves. that how that Jesus Christ is in you except ye repro reproate. He says, "Do you know &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ is in you if Jesus Christ is in you? Will you behave the way you behave?" That's why he says you examine yourself because the Bible says we walk by faith not by sight. Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; We are people that are on a journey going somewhere &gt;&gt; and then we are preparing ourselves. Then he says, "If you continue, I'm reading Colossians now 1:23. If you continue in the faith grounded, &gt;&gt; settled and be not move away from the hope of the gospel." Now he goes on and state the the seven virtues. You know the seven virtues. faith, &gt;&gt; virtue, &gt;&gt; knowledge, &gt;&gt; temperance, &gt;&gt; patience, &gt;&gt; godliness, brotherly kindness, are you in that root or there come times where you lose you lose your temper Then where do you put that part your temperance? That is why he says he forneew us. He knows who will go through that part. It's not you that can control yourself. You just surrender and then the promises are are precious then he is the one that will guide you through all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there is a hope of gospel. Yeah. The Bible speaks about you being rooted, build up in him. So if you are rooted and build up in him, nobody will uproot you. Nobody will take what is yours. If you are believer, you are believer eternally. You will live the word of God eternally. That very tree of life that Eve disbelieved, &gt;&gt; you will get it in New Jerusalem. If you don't believe it there, then how are you going to believe it? That tree is the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Fine. So now nobody will uproot you because you are stable in the faith. And it goes on in the book of Timothy, it speaks about good conscience concerning &gt;&gt; faith that have made. So he says now you you don't have to make a shipwreck. You know what is a shipwreck? is to uh reject biblical truth. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have the Bible says you must have a good conscience or your conscience must condemn you to be able to follow God's guidance. Amen. &gt;&gt; The power of decision that is a spoken word. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 88. He says here, "Heavenly Father, I bless this my brother and ask the glory of God of God that raised Jesus from the grave. The great quickening spirit." You say what he says. He says the great quickening spirit who stand here in a form of light &gt;&gt; bending down with within my soul. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then here he says this book I'll I'll get there. what you call the it's redemption by judgment. &gt;&gt; It says friends, people who have those minds that are receptable uh that sorry let me start. See what what it is friends. People who has those minds receptacles to isms. The first thing you know they got a spirit of delusion and go all and believe in error. And then he says don't do that be solid be stable unmovable abounding in Christ. Otherwise you'll cross a separating line there is a separating line. Then once you cross the separating line it will be difficult to come back. When Abraham met him he was meedced &gt;&gt; to Abraham &gt;&gt; he was king. Abraham Abraham &gt;&gt; is the citizen of Salem. &gt;&gt; Being the citizen, you're the king of the sea. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he unfolded what all the attributes will do in the end. All the attributes at the end because you are the seed of Abraham. Abra. If you receive of Abraham then all you will do exactly like your father. How did your what did your father do? &gt;&gt; Your father recognized him as the king. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then what did Melisedc do? recognize him as an attribute &gt;&gt; because Abraham was in mec. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he saw that this is my attribute and Abraham recognize him as the king. That is our duty. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he unfolded what all the attributes will do in the end. That is why the prophet said have you met me? That is the attribute at the end doing exactly what what our father when any attribute of God meets him he will appear as God to him. Amen. Amen. Now if you read in the book of Hebrews Uh, chapter six. No, no, no, no, not not the Bible. The book, the spoken word. &gt;&gt; That was preached 1957. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Chapter 6. &gt;&gt; Chapter 6. &gt;&gt; In paragraphs 634, listen to what he says. &gt;&gt; He says, Abraham recognized him because inside of his veil was an anchor. Inside of his vein was an anchor holding that promise in Abraham was an anchor that hold that promise. Abraham himself, he had that thing like the Samaran woman. He had that thing and when he met him, that anchor started vibrating. This man is the one that is in me. And what was in God started vibrating. This is my son. &gt;&gt; You know the Bible says he is a rock. &gt;&gt; And then he says now don't turn your back away. &gt;&gt; From that rock because there is a a coordination between you and that rock. When you meet that rock, you will know that you are a stone. He didn't preach to Peter. He just said follow me. Right. Amen. There was a coordination all his disciples. There was there was no way that he testified unto them. He was a magnet. He just called them. Some will be praying somewhere but the magnet will pull you. Now if we come from him, we will go back to him. And if we don't come from him, we will never go back. We can pray, we can fast, we can read. You know the Bible says the brother of Jacob, &gt;&gt; he prayed until he looking for repentance, but he couldn't. And when you preach to the people, you don't force them. You just bring it in individually. They'll grab what is theirs. They will grab what is theirs. They come from God, they'll go back to God. Are we together? You just uh uh spread the seed and those that have crossed the separation there's nothing there's nothing that they can do. So he says Abraham inside of his way was an anchor it holds that promise. Not because he had some sensation. Amen. But God made him the promise. God made him the promise. and when he come into contact with that that great magnet he knew it was that flesh &gt;&gt; are we together now the Bible &gt;&gt; has given us some promises some things &gt;&gt; that we will recognize The prophet here speaks about three elements. Uh in this book, the ark &gt;&gt; he says here there are three elements that people live in. &gt;&gt; First the humanistic. Second, the divine revelation &gt;&gt; and the third is a vision. &gt;&gt; It continues. &gt;&gt; Now this like in prayer when you pray for anyone inhumanistic we say will I hope he'll get well. I'm hoping and I'm believing which you trying to use all the faith. When you pray for somebody, you just say I hope my prayer has reached God. God will heal him. Then he says that that is humanistic. And the second one he says is a divine revelation. When something is revealed to you, you just know in your heart, it's going to happen. Yet there's nothing &gt;&gt; but just the revelation. He says if you can say to that mountain must move and only a grain move know that it will move. We know that it is moving because grain move. So that's a divine revelation. And then we said there's a third one which is a vision that is thus said the Lord that's perfectly positive. Right. Amen. H then he continues then okay let me say to you there are some things that are happening that will tell you how far are you what is happening before the rapture the prophet speaks about the squeeze there should be a squeeze I just want to read you something here uh of what is happening. Look, you have to take what the scripture says and check what is happening around you and check the behavior of the people and check the behavior of the government and check the behavior of the different countries. and go back to the scripture. Then it will tell you, go to the promises and check this thing according to the promise and see if it's not like that. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. You know our Lord Jesus Christ after he had a Lord's supper with his disciples, I will take no more of the fruit of the vine. Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now let's do it like this. &gt;&gt; The the the the the prophet promised us that there will be a squeeze right &gt;&gt; what is happening now I I'll go and read that quote &gt;&gt; but I I want to say to you uh there's this thing that is happening that is doing by all the countries I will concentrate only on our own uh h country. There's some things that are very good that the country is doing but these things are eye openers to you the message believers that you should know where you are. Okay. The prophet speaks about the temp squeeze. This code you all know you have it. But I'll read it again. He says the hour of temptation. He's speaking about that in the book of Phil Philadelphiaian churches. You know about it. He says, "I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation." &gt;&gt; Sorry. I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation. who shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth. Then he explains this verse is not a declaration that the true church will go in into and through tribulation. It mean that if if it means that it would have said that but it says I will keep thee from the hour of temptation. He say now this temptation is exactly like the temptation in Eden. It's exactly like the temptation in Eden. What was the temptation is that God gave Adam and Eve his way. They didn't have faith in that word, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't believe it because he said, "If you eat on that tree, you will die." Somebody came and says you will not die. Now they started weighing the God said you will die. The other one say you will not die. They took then he said &gt;&gt; God gave Adam a bride. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But before he could marry that bride because he said multiply and and replenish their before he could multiply rejected the word of God. Then he said now he raised the second Adam which is our Lord Jesus and then he came with a promise of but before he could marry that so-called bride then was already mixed up with dogmas and things like that. That is why now God raised you. He said the little group that I will marry this that I'm going to marry. Not even a single one will miss it. That's what he says. You don't have to struggle. If you're going to miss it, you're not part of it. Right. Amen. But to be part of it is to be in line like Enoch. Then it says now the temptation is is like the temptation in Eden it will be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition God's commandment. inviting proposition that will be in direct opposite to God's commandment. And yet from the standpoint of human reason, it will be so very right, so enlightening, lifegiving as to fool the world. Only the very elect will not be fooled. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he comes now and says the temptation will come as follows. Now he speaks about the acumenical move that has started on what seems to be a beautiful and blessed principle. I will explain that uh fulfilling Christ's prayer that we might be one. It &gt;&gt; it will become so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her. through adherence to the principles enacted into law. I won't read it all but what I want to show you what's happening uh is that now there is a movement from the government which is very good &gt;&gt; the CRL I'm sure you know it &gt;&gt; CRL it's a council &gt;&gt; for regulatory and local &gt;&gt; commission council It it enforce laws. &gt;&gt; It oversee and enforce laws, regulations, standards in a sector. It's a good thing that you must not do whatever you want. But it is so good that when it comes now to the church is very very strict also. &gt;&gt; Firstly there should be one law. You must go to school. You cannot stand behind the bullpit and harass people. You go to jail, &gt;&gt; which people say, "Hallelujah." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; But you go to school, &gt;&gt; they're going to teach their own doctrine because they say, "Let us combine and do one thing." Because there are people that doom people and say instead of praying, you spraying with the doom. Some make you to eat snakes. Some make you to eat grass. I don't think that people will allow that. When the government take a step, everybody is going to say hallelujah. Some churches are fly by night. Now they're doing something that is good. But in some other countries, they don't beg you. They just tell you that like in China, &gt;&gt; I was reading here. 30 pastors are in jail who belong to any of the Zionist church. All the underground churches are raided underground in in Nigeria right on northern part of Nigeria Nigeria the church are persecuted they don't want what they see here in South Africa so they've started now the government you see it's a good thing but then when you have a promise and a guideline. You could see that something has started. It's it's not in full force and the prophet says what we call a third pull right now it's not in full force. He said let the squeeze start. Then you will know what a third pull is. Are we together? One day I was speaking with the pastor. He said to me, "When last did you hear me speaking about the underworld?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Underorld? We have long defeated. &gt;&gt; He's got no power. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; But what I'm trying to show you is that now before we our bodies change, uh there will be some things that will happen. And the prophet says, some people are going to surrender to to that. He he said now it'll become so strong politically that they bear pressure upon the government to cause all the one that is so strong I'm talking about ecumenical council that that is become so strong politically that she's pressure upon the ground to cause all to join with either directly or indirectly through adherence to the principle to go direct or indirect. is not right. Now little group will lose characters, privileges the privilege &gt;&gt; until they lose property and spiritual rights. That that's what will happen right. Amen. Now he continues and say h in this book. Okay, let me let me read it. It says, "And all the time these things are going on, the spirit of the living God is thriving with flesh, trying to get men away from his own achievement, trying to get man away from his own selfish motive. own selfish motives and objective &gt;&gt; to plan which God has laid down. As long as man works in his own plan, he will be a failure. Says as long &gt;&gt; as man works according to his plan, he will be a failure. And a man can only achieve that when he comes back with the right objective and the right motive that is according to God's plan. Any other foundation is a sinking sand. because he says divine gifts are very sacred. And remember a me a person could send their soul to hell with one. If you notice &gt;&gt; on the platform &gt;&gt; on my cases &gt;&gt; on my cases &gt;&gt; my patience my patience no but patience the patience are yes amen I'm very careful of what I say let me read it again divine gifts are very sacred. And remember, a person could send their soul to hell with one. &gt;&gt; If you'll notice on the platform, on my cases, my patient very careful of what I say. Amen. &gt;&gt; I weigh everywhere. &gt;&gt; I find the condition of that soul. Before I'm saying something, &gt;&gt; he says he weigh the condition of that soul before he could say. Right. Amen. Now coming back now in closing the right way is that now he has given us a promise &gt;&gt; and when he has given us promises we stick to those promises because they are divine right there some other things and these supernatural acts is to bring your faith back to him quicken. It's right quick to make it quicken to him the supernatural acts and to bring your faith to him so that it should be quicker. But it will have to be something to quicken your faith bring you up into that place to where you can accept it. It might take you to a place where you can accept it. Then it will quicken you. He says we can't even have faith for divine healing. let alone rapturing faith. You got to have faith that will change and quicken this body to be taken away. So that's what I have for you today. May the Lord bless you. I always like that song. Uh &gt;&gt; that song. &gt;&gt; I'm now here on earth. You can sing for us that song. Lord bless you all. Amen. And I'm God. Jehovah Sing him I am &gt;&gt; now over how Save him. City Father. who see my mother. Oh my god. Let's sing one more time. My father command behind. Amen. Amen. May the Lord richly bless you.

Can we bow our heads? Dear heavenly father, the mighty God, creator of all heavens and the earth. Father, we come to you this afternoon after you have delivered a masterpiece after you delivered your word in our souls. Father, here we are in this baptismal service. Two young boys have repented, Lord. They've heard your word that we are born in sin and shape iniquity. We came in this world speaking lies. But by your grace and mercy, finally Lord, you saw what is in their souls and their spirits. And your word pricked their hearts. They took that decision, Lord, to come and be baptized. And your word tells us that baptismal it shows that we are dying with you, Lord. and will raise with you. &gt;&gt; As our brothers are entering in this water, Father and these souls come to you today, Father, we are rejoicing in our hearts because the Bible says when one sinner repents on earth, there is joy in heaven. Father, we are coming to you with this baptismal service that may your word find a dwelling place in their hearts as they enter in. Lord, you have promised that you will come in in their hearts. Lord, together with the brothers that are taking them in, as John the Baptist one day did and Lord, they were saved. and all of us Lord being witnesses of this great word of God that has conform us and change us to your very image. Father, we thank you. We ask for thy blessings in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Acts chapter 2 from verse 36-39. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. Fool is Oh, speech speech. Oh. That's for Okay. Joy, soul. Amen. Just to come forth for a word of prayer. Let let us pray. Heavenly Father, we'd like to thank you, Lord Almighty, for these souls. The pastor would always say, "Yes, they might look young, but their souls are not young." Now that Lord Almighty they surrender their lives unto thee at the very young age. We believe with all our hearts Lord Almighty that you will undertake Lord as per promise gracious heavenly father like we've just said that calling them Lord Almighty from the book and you are calling them uh by their names and they are hearing Lord Almighty your voice. Thank you father. May you be with them Lord and guide them and let them grow Lord Almighty until the day when their bodies will be quickened Lord. In the name of my Lord Jesus Christ I pray. Amen. Amen. Brother, can you come forth and just sing a song for us? Then after we'll hand over to the worship team. They will also sing a song. Then after they will sing a song to release the church. Just turn to your neighbor and say, "God bless you." Amen. Shalom. Oh, how about you? &gt;&gt; Our soul I want you to Sh. We don't worship. Since you are singing We love you, Lord. We lift you up. &gt;&gt; We lift you, Lord. Such situation. He is seeking. Go see how glor Glor. Yeah. Glory. Glory. Holy. I know it's so great. All right. Sorry. Come on. Uh-huh. Heat. Heat. Heat.
