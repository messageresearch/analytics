Description:
Title: Hearing His Voice Today
Preached By Pastor Erastus Makuwa  at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 07 July 2024.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
John 10: 25 – 29 | Revelation 4: 5 |John 1: 19-23 | I Peter 3: 18-19 | II Peter 2: 4
The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about hearing God’s voice in our day.

The word of God is a seed, and we know that a seed has stages. When you have a seed, you have everything. The Word of God must also have stages and we must know the stage the Word is in.
It is impossible for the sheep not to hear the voice of the Shepherd because it grew under the tutorship of that Shepherd. The is no circumstance that can make the sheep not to hear. If it was his voice there, then it is still his voice here. His voice is his Word; the bible is God’s voice in letter form.
For the sheep to hear, there must be preaching and teaching of the Word of God. For it to hear, is not with all night prayers and fasting. It is in the preaching and teaching of the Word of God that a sheep will hear and follow.
In each age God is addressing a particular class of people, he is not addressing all. This class of people are the once who have the ability to hear, and they are given this ability to hear. 
Jesus said as the father send me so send I you. We must know how the father had send him. When the father sends him He came in him. A shepherd is there to protect the sheep. He chooses men to preach the gospel and that is where the voice of God will come from. Satan is not afraid of noise, but he is afraid of authority. When the true anointed speaks that is the voice of God.
In each age God sends messengers and they are the voice of God in that age. God will judge the world by their voices.
The two disciples of John when they heard him saying behold the lamp of God, Andries and Phillip followed Jesus. John said to the other disciples that He must increase, and I must decrease. 
There was John’s disciples and there are bro Branham’s disciples. B...

25 to 29 Jesus answered them I told you and ye believed not the words that I do the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them ET eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man plug them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to plug them out of my father's hand Hallelujah uh Revelation 4 ver 5 4 verse 5 and out of the throne proceedeth Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God close our eyes as our asking God in our place dear heavenly father thou creator of all Heavens the Earth and beneath amen father this morning we come to you your word that you wrote through your holy prophet father is been read in our midst am in a form of a Bible in our hands we know that it is from those scws Lord we believe that the same power that wrote the the word of God the Bible is right here here right now Hallelujah you came down lord and you spoke through the mouth of the Lord Jesus amen this today Father we are standing before you knowing that you are present amen because the seven seal is being opened you have sent us a prophet you have sent us pastors here is our pastor standing before us with that special anointing expecting you Lord to come direct to our hearts your word is so powerful lord it's quick it's more sharper than a Double H sword Lord it can go into through the hearts of the people amen we are standing before you we believe in that special anointing yes that you've been with us after the seven angels have visited Us in the days of the Prophet right on Mount sunset Mountain Seven Angels Came From eternity and the Bible became a new book to us you open up the lamp the the book of lamp that was written before the foundation of the world from eternity Lord you came down to prepare us as a bride for the Rapture yes is our pastor standing before us we pray for that special anointing that when we leave this place each and every one of us across everywhere Lord they will say the Lord has spoken like those men were walking going to ouse and Lord they said you came down Jesus after you resurrected and you spoke to them and they said did not our hearts burn as he spoke with us along the way Hallelujah on our way for the Rapture Lord and to Eternity father we pray amen that may we your word today amen find a Dwelling Place in our hearts in a precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen we may just take our seats God bless each and every one of you um I'm just going to talk with you going to talk about hearing his voice today the word of God the Bible says is a seat the seat we know has got stages start with being a seat and we know if you have got a seat in your you have got everything in there in that City there are Roots St branches flower fruits seeds but you can't see them but they are there even if you can break the seat you can see those things but if you want to see them just put the seed prepared soil then those things will just come it will never need your prayer but if you place them in the good in the good condition those things will just come hallu they it has got those stages must thing the Le and if you destroy the you destroy the seat then it will move from there to a stock then it will move from there to the sh and from the shock it will go back to the SE then you must know those stages and if the word of God is a seat it must also have stages and you and I we must know what stage is the word of God now because there were two kings it was Ahab and Jehosaphat Jehosaphat visited Ahab when they were there I believe they were talking they were talking about their God they talking about their Journey how they moved from from Egypt to where they are helped them and they start to talk about said let's just take because it is ours is part of the promise of God he was right but the timing of that it was that there was a man of God there which was jehos he said well we can take it but let's hear what God is saying about it today he was aware that the word of God has [Music] stages we must know where the word of God is today we must just be worshipers but you must know where the word of is but when in joh Jesus says here my sheep hear my voice and they follow me in the Old Testament because when Jesus was preaching always when he gives Parables when he was giving he was talking to the Jews he was talking to the people who knew those because when he the kingdom of God is like a king has made a A Feast for his son then he sent people to go and invite [Music] people Messengers to go and invite people to come we read this day we read the word there but those who are from those people they know how marriages were arranging those days they know that the owner is the one who must take out invitation he must take he must know the number of people is inv then that's why they didn't wonder when Jesus said there was someone there who hasn't got an waiting G that person was taken out they didn't say why did they take this one out because he was C in in the road there because he was called unaware they knew that at the door there there was waiting G you get through the door you will get them but when he was talking with these people with the sheep and he say my sh no he he was talking about them they know how the owner of the ship does they knew that the owner of the ship had to go out to look for a good person who would come and look after his sheep those ship must grow under his to the ship they must be they must know his voice they must grow learing under his [Music] words when they were branding the ship they were bring the the Shepherd in the hand which is on the ship it was in the shepherd's [Music] hand when he look at his you see the number which is on the [Music] ship that's why he says even if the mother of a child can forget baby I will never forget you because you are in my hand he is he is also mared with the Sheep he was part of the ship that's why he says it was impossible that the Sheep could not hear the voice of the shepherd because it has grown under his true Jesus said those who have had those who have leared from the father they will come to me because they have grown under his father that is how the Sheep were done in those days is saying here my sh he my voice it is no it is under no cumstances where the Sheep where his sheep would not share his voice if if it is of his ship it will hear his voice the prophet says if it was his voice [Music] then it is it will be his voice even now let me just read something amen I want to read for you here he says in this book what has he done he he has placed with them a true teacher Prophet St with the word the Bible my sheep hear my voice said Jesus if that was his voice then it is his voice now anything contrary to that voice it is not it is not sheep foot and they won't follow iten if it is his words then it is his words today if the ship followed the voice then the Sheep will follow the voice today the prophet says his voice is his [Music] weight and in this book did not he says his voice is is is God's word in a letter [Music] form am am he says the Bible is the voice of in other words the word of God the Bible is the voice of God in a for the she of God it will follow the word of God which is the Bible amen the prophet says I with those who follow me the Bible is our ultimate in other words they cannot go over they cannot go under the B is theultimate only the ship can hear and understand not [Music] all let me read something here for you and for me the word of God says in this book I sincerely believe that the spirit of God has been speaking to us not only teaching us the truth of the age but he has been Faithfully dealing with they may turn to him because that is the reason that is the reason for all preaching and teaching for it is in the preaching and teaching of the word of God that the sheep hear the voice of God and follow him amen can I repeat for it is in the preaching and teaching the way that the Sheep here the voice of God Amen for the ship to hear there must be teaching and preaching [Music] of the word of God for the sheep to follow it's not for the ship to follow it's not for miracles and what what it's not for all night prayer and fasting those are not for sheep for the for the ship to follow there must be teaching and preaching not only teaching and preaching but teaching and preaching of the way of that is when the Sheep will open the Earth amen because that is where the voice of God comes he says here it is in the preaching and teaching of the way that the sheep hear the voice of the voice of God and follow are you together with us we are building something [Music] when the genine fored Son of God here is the word of God but let me start to read from here first so has God in every age ordained his church for that age a message for thate I said when I started the word of God is a SE and a SE stages that is why the prophet says here so God in every age ordained his church for that [Music] age when God sent Paul there was ordained pastors under him they were ordained [Music] members under those pastors there were sheep there were shepherds there there were sheep there because Paul addressed the Shepherds when he was giving them a farewell speech in each age [Music] ordained that there must be a messenger it is ordained there and there must be Shepherds it is ordained there there must be sh it is ordained there knew that Satan will be there but he Ed that there must be Shi and those sh will hear because in every age we hear this way this phrase saying he that ear let him hear because in every age the holy spirit is speaking the holy spirit is teaching and if the holy spirit is teaching teaching through the shepherd through the Shepherd in this A in that age when when the the holy spirit is teaching when the Holy Spirit is speaking it means it is it is the voice of God for that particular age and the voice can't be there there is there is there is neither no one who has got an ear is heing here because you are born to here in each age is addressing a particular addressing all [Music] even even if this ways goes all to all but but it is not all who will receive it only a particular class of people and those particular class of people is those who have got an ability to hear the word of because when it says he that had an ear it means he that had an ability and he that had an ability that ability is not from him he is given that ability he is born with that ability because the prophet said you are born with a stone [Applause] Amen Let me but when that hour comes the holy spirit of God which was at the beginning spoke out message that Spirit hands that egg and when he hears that message then is not church denomination going to hold it it will rise to the heights you see he is typing this with anlet say in HH there is a voice coming the voice of the mother and the there will it will be the ones that will hear that voice and not any other thing there but the [Music] the in every there is [Music] someone my sister and my brother let me say to you this is a Godly fear knowing that I may never live to see an Easter gate but there is one thing sure when a genine for ordained Son of God by the word of God he that voice of God he will rise and go to meet it it is the potential that is going to meet the real living way in other words he has got the potential that is going to one day he going to the real living way when he comes this one because he has got the potential he will go and meet that one it is that is going to meet the real living weight the bride will meet the groom she is part of this body amen a genuine forain son or daughter of God by the word of God when he hear that voice for his age it must be for his age not for the past age but for his age because he or she will know it for the preaching and teaching is is for the Sheep to hear the voice of God because it is by preaching and teaching who must preach mustach that is what the that is what the let's he what the let let the prophet tell us he says now God could have chose to preach the gospel by the son or the moon or by the stars or by the winds or by nature but he choose M to P the gospel and that is where the voice of God will come if it was the voice of God then it is the words of God because he chose made after he said my sheep hear my voice he said if they receive you they receive me if they hear you they me as the father sent me so I send as the father sent so I send you we must know how his father sent when his father sent he came and dwell inside it means if he sent me must come and inside he choose me to preach the gospel that is where the voice of what will come you can judge the voice you can judge the voice according to the according the word it [Music] expresses then you can see see what kind of voice that you are [Applause] listen if it is contrary to the word don't listen to it but if it is the weight then God is bound to back that weight and vate it and make it true he promised to do it you see the Sheep needs a Shepherd to help you see it must be a shepherd one day brother came to me he said my he said I I got a problem something is troubling me at home there when I'm sleeping it pulls me by the leg said what what is happening he said no it PS me I kept quiet and came again I'm tell I told you something is TR I just said I will come there and pass I'm not going there to pray but I'm going to pass and I went there I get inside the the sitting room there is a passage towards his his room he showed me when I am sitting here I saw something passing getting in my room then when I sleep that start to every day he said no I pass here I I've passed and I pass away then I was with brother the Elder there is a witness when I say I'm going to pass he said are you going to pray I said no I'm just going to pray he said why don't you pray he said no just want the he said when I get there he said let's pray he said he said let us pray I said no I didn't say I said pass then I pass I go to brothers and sisters check them and tomorrow I asked the brother what is your [Applause] friend I'm not I'm not talking about those things but I just want to show you that God a Shepherd is there to protect the [Applause] Sheep if I sent is [Applause] me I'm protecting the [Applause] ship you don't need to say why don't the pastor come [Music] but the p is here [Applause] but doesn't say the past is here there something WR [Applause] with a choose men to preach the gospel that is where the voice of God will come from [Music] Satan is not afraid of noise he's afraid of [Applause] authority when the true anointed speaks [Applause] am is the voice of God Amen when they true anointed speaks is the voice not each and everyone but they true if you always hear me when I made the [Music] marriages whenever I am I will say with the power of offered to me by my pastor when he was ordaining me as [Music] a therefore I declare you [Music] husband because there is power which was transferred to [Applause] me you see I'm not the pastor by [Applause] election I'm a pastor by predestination [Applause] I don't care what you say I I could see back there I could I could follow the the footsteps and see where where that pastorship [Music] [Applause] [Music] started you see p why don't you put this man to be a pastor and in those days I was not even that thing was not even in me to be Pastor it do not there but he saw [Applause] that I don't know what happened when the true anointed speaks it is the voice of God who hasing who has each age each age a messenger of that age is a voice of God for that age and they are not if and it is not all who will hear him but those who hear him are the Sheep of God for that age he is not worried about others because he is sent for that particular ship God is going to judge the World by their voices of those Messengers God is going to judge them our brother has read for us in the book of um Revelation he says Before the Throne light voices those voices the prophet says are the voices of the seven Messengers because he says their voices will be heard loud and clear in judgment their voices will be heard loud andar a judgment there that's why we hear them there their voices there because they were the voice of God if you hear them you hearing God if you refuse them you refusing God it was hearing the voice of God in your age in each age speaks every time every time God speaks it depends who you [Applause] are those who are part of his ship they will he all right amen when John was asked let's read John 1 verse 19 233 I am following the voice because I must hear it in my age [Music] amen John 1 verse 19 to 23 and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who are thou and he confessed and denied not but confessed I am not the Christ yeah and they asked him what then are thou Elias and he said I am not are thou that that prophet and he answered no yes then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what said thou of thyself he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah that is when they asked John who are thou the Bible says he did not deny but he referred them to Isaiah 40:3 Isaiah 40:3 he said I am the voice of the one crying in the wilderness is what he answer them John was the voice of God for that age and we know that only two of John's disciples were the Sheep of God John had many disciples but only two John were were God's disciple some remained with John they were called John's Disciples of course they came to John they said the one who you were talking about is down there is baptizing people they were talking about Jesus they were with John they said to John the one we talking about is down there is baptizing people and people are no more coming to us they are going to that man and John says he must increase I must decrease they were John's disciples [Music] this is our P but they were with Andre and Philip Philip and and were with them but when they had John behold the L of God and and pH follow Jesus they left there they they go to Jesus but when these on when they say he is there Bap don't say didn't say hey you must also go to he said he must increase I must decrease you know what did they say Amen but they remain here amen Pastor [Music] am we also we have got bram's disciples [Music] but notr because he has already pointed something let me read that is what John is saying I must decrease you must [Music] increase God can't have two on the scene on the earth at the same time one has the message you know I must decrease he is the messenger I've been up to I have been up to this time now he he takes my place that is what John say he must increase I must decrease John the Baptist said are you together with can I read something for you are you happy if you are happy then I will read if you are not happy then I will stop brother Bram says brother if that great person is here he will increase I must [Music] decrease do you get do you get that thing let me read something here who is that great person oh Pastor will tell you who is that great person I am only telling you what I seen and what has been told to me and now you do whatever you want to do I don't know who is going what is going to take place I don't know I just know that those seven tunders all that mystery the heaven was quiet everybody understand congregation says amen amen it may be time it may be the hour that this great person that we are expecting to rise on the scene may rise on the SE maybe this ministry that I've tried to take people back to the weight the foundation if it test I will be leaving you for good there won't be two of us here the same time it is he will increase I will decrease I don't know Hallelujah amen there was there was John's disciples there is he said I was reading a writing on the sto after I finished that stone was like a pyramid I read something then I cut the stone on the top I open the stone then I said to the people who were listening at me I said to them when I was reading there I was when I was reading there they was listening at me amen but when I opened I said to them come look inside then they came and they look then I go when I go some they look they where is he disappeared and they move who are [Applause] those they failed to wait in the St because they had nothing because now the voice is from there the voice is [Applause] from when you say I head you head from there when you say I he you hear from that from from the inside all right am let's go there the Bible promis that before his second coming there will come the voice of God again to introduce him after introducing him because are you listening there was somebody sitting on the throne having a book in his there was Proclamation who is worth take the book open this no one was but the L moved from his own Thro and took the book where was the L if you want to know was the where the lamb took the [Applause] book it has taken it from the [Music] throne throne of the father if you want to know where is Father the father's Throne you must know where the lamb is taken the book because the lamb is taken the book from the father's thr [Applause] and the prophet said he took it from within himself I also say Amen because he he is the Throne of the [Music] father then if he take the book he must take it from within then the prophet said he took the book and open it and sit down why because he took the book and go to his own Throne to see down there to open the book in his own Throne that is what we call the po [Music] amen we shall come to that God willing in this book and we called my commission my commission more parag brother Bram says let me read it here for my brothers could Ed it for me so I can read it I'm just your brother by the grace of God is what say I am also saying it I'm humbly saying I'm just your brother and your pastor but I'm your brother by the grace of God but when the angel of the Lord moves down becomes then a voice of God to you amen amen maybe if I offended you by saying that forgive me but I felt that I might be resented but I am God's voice to [Applause] you that is what the prophet is saying says is the voice of God to me amen I don't know to you [Applause] also say now I want you to know this show you that listen to this tap you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself you might have thought the day that I was trying to say that about myself in that I was piing this message you may think I was saying I am picking the message I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just I'm just I'm just a voice and my voice even against my better [Music] judgment I wanted to be a [Music] Trapper but but it is the will of my father that I do determined to do I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performed and for these things that happens as perfect they only one that I am the only one that is near when does it when he does it I was only a voice you you might resent I Amed but I'm the voice of God he is repeating it here or I'm just a voice of what I'm just a voice that he used to say it it wasn't that I knew is what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel and his message was the mystery that God unfolded not a man is God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the Son of God he was talking about himself he's the messenger from the the son of man is Christ is the one that you are feeding am I felt that I might be but the voice of God to you see again that time was under inspiration I felt bad about it first time but it repeated it now I can say nothing in myself but what he shows me I say it you believe it and Watch What Happens he says he is The Voice if you want to hear the voice of God then you must hear him because he is the voice if it was the voice of God then then it is the voice of God now if it is the voice of God then it must be the voice of God now [Applause] amen are you with me brother is the voice of God only sheep will hear him God still has the voice for his sheep today that voice is in the bride through God send past I don't say through God send Pastor I there are there are voice of God there if you hear them you hear God's voice in your day godship will hear God's voice today from there if you are not go sheep you will never hear God's voice for today brother BR in the book The 6 he say something there he says the voice of God is the spiritual sign the voice of God is the spiritual sign that is what he say he said but all that got their names on The Book of Life God will call and they will hear it my sheep hear my voice Jesus said only thing you got to do only thing we past say to do is only to make a [Music] ship only fa not good call you see the Sheep call my sheep hear my voice what is the voice I want to tell you what what is the voice a voice a voice of God is a spiritual that is what he says he says the words of God is a spiritual are you together with the words of God is a spiritual the spiritual sign is the voice of God let me say something here I want to read my books here I have got many books here but I'm going to read them he says in one of the books he says all all Mysteries here all Ministries is um they have got signs because science are attractions pools pools pools pools also are attractions signs are attractions and pools are attractions in know other words all Mysteries I've got their signs I want to read it for you here and um I'm about the to finish but don't worry I'm about to reach where going I was trying to build something here if they didn't believe the sign then the thir got it all Ministries three signs if it is sent from God Jesus had the three sons Moses had three [Music] are you together Jesus had three signs three when God gave Moses he gave him three signs and he said if they don't listen to The First [Music] they will listen to the the second one if they don't listen to that one but when he come to the the doesn't have a voice the second the first and the second has voices but the doesn't have just like with Jesus the first has voice because the first was healing and the second was discernment they were dealing with men but when it come to the F with Jesus they said he went to preach but not dealing with men that's why the third one in Egypt doesn't have a voice the B doesn't say if they don't hear the second the voice of the second but the first and the second had voices are you there the first sign he gave to the shepherd Prophet his Ro turned into a serent his ro ro turned into aent I believe it was a dangerous serent I believe it was not just a I believe it was a Ratt snake or a [Music] m but but God said Moses by the T you see it is dangerous to pick the snake by the T picking the snake by the immedi you better hold it by the neck but not by the T but God saides hold it by the T you see it needs Faith there it needs Faith to the one who's talking to you you must know who is talking to you take the snake by the T [Applause] [Music] [Applause] God help [Applause] us that is the first sign he said the second his hand turned into Leos the to take water out of N River and turn it to blood now he give him three signs to vindicate gate to Egypt also to Israel that he was go book and waight now remember Moses called into creation because he he he he throw scent up and he threw the scent and throw it up and he tend him to F watch the f sign he gave him was not related to his occupation neither was it related to his person his that sign notice the first two signs notice the first two signs related to him to him himself his occupation there was the only two signs that the Bible says had [Music] voice what the prophet says they are the only two s which the Bible says had voice the others didn't have a voice but the two signs that was given from his own person to his people his voices but the third sign now notice the the third sign that was given it is of death amen am are you listen here you see Jesus St side which is called the third Pro it was when he preached read the book of First Peter I'm going to leave you not reach where I want to go but I'm going to reach you I'm going to leave you but I've not reached the place I was going read First Peter chapter 3 verse 19 I believe so first Peter 3: 19 by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in praon and then second Peter start from 18 18 for Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring unto us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison you see what God is saying here he says he went to preach to the souls in prison it was his second Peter 2:4 second Peter chter 2:4 let me see something here for if God Spar not the angels that sinned but cast them down to Hell and deliver them into chains of Darkness to be reserved unto judgment yeah you see you see what what he these two scriptures they are talking about the same thing they talking about the souls in prison they are the same Jesus preached to them they say they didn't believe during Noah's time who are those Souls so let me just because I'm skipping some of the things so these Spirits these angels that preached was in prison Angels if you notice it here is a little a which means men Angels Messengers here on the earth they sinned and the only way that they could sin would be [Music] disbelief and they they had their own religion and they did not believe the message of Noah there were preachers there these were preachers they were Messengers during time they were preaching there against what Noah is preaching they disbel Noah's message then they were in prison you see the thir tool of Noah's message it is when he was preaching to them he was preaching in the in the ark that is the third he was preaching to the souls that will never repent that is of and lot that is the third man are you together because the first one the first pool is lot and the second pool is two MERS and the third one is the one was with Abraham is the thir in s because he the last want to go there when he went there after that he preached to the souls that will never repent pool now he says if the the third pool of Jesus Christ was to preach to the soul that will never repent what about now the fa because if you can read it there it will say the third pool was was when he received the S because those and it will say again the thir are those angels it will say again the thir is the revelation of the seals that is what he would say where did where did he get the seals in the Pyramid of those angels because now he has left he has left another part he has taken another now the preaching is has changed is no more helping people are you together with me that's why now the message is is preaching to the lost that is the thir po amen if Jesus preached to their lost he is the same Jesus who is revealed in our day that it must do the same amen together with me beautiful he is preaching to the spirits that's why now when the pastor here tend to preach this message some people away because now it has when when Moses throw the stick down people could understand when he put his there people could understand but when he started the third one people could understand when no was preaching there the ark people were there they had chance but when he was in the ark they had no chance now amen now this ministry we have has passed H it's only it is judgment to others but it could it is it is for the bride because it said the thir pool will catch it catch what big fish not these small pools they catch small fish because people like Miracles it catches people but when you get to the it catch only the big [Applause] fish I said them skiing many things this is for the bride they said those angels came with the salt this Sal came with the angel they give it to the prophet and he said God help me take this thought and go through the tree of life it was the revelation of the word of God it was a Ministry higher but for the bride but for the others it is Judgment it has passed they will never hear it even if they try it will never help them because it's for the people who are outside it is not for them the is not for them hallah amen amen hallelujah amen hearing the word of God today is only the bre will hear it it is for them he that overcome I will give him a white stone where did the prophet get the interpretation inside all right let's just stop there for a while bless amen let's Close Our Eyes Mighty
