Description:
Title: A Place Has Thou Prepared For Me
Text: Man In The Image of God
Preached by Pastor Edgar Kuchingale on 29 September 2024

Genesis 1: 26 | Genesis 2: 7 | Acts 7: 46-48 | Matthews 3: 16-17 | Exodus 14: 25

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about a place prepared by God.

Two people were created, one in the image of God and the other from the soul. The two were together.

The heavenly one did not have hands to work but the earthly one had hands.
The man in his image was a theophany, but the one in Genesis 2 was the man we know now.
The theophany one cannot die.

When Adam was a theophany, death could not control him. When he sinned, the theophany returned back to God because it does not dwell in sin. He lost a part of him which was eternal.

When God does something, He prepares first. The people are researching the fish that swallowed Johnah. But they can't find it because God prepared it. We are supposed to prepare a body in which God can dwell.

A normal man cannot get rid of sin. God is asking us to get rid of sin so He can dwell in us.
People could have constructed boards during Noah's time but only that of Noah floated because it was constructed by God.

We are preparing bodies which will be able to go against the force of gravity one day. There will be no scientific proof as in the days of Noah. People who are going to heaven are the ones who are preparing.

Theophany is a body subject to the word. If your body is not under subjection of the word you must question yourself. But you bypassed your theophany to be a flesh-man to be tempted by sin.

Everyone of us is serving His eternal purpose. This time it is us who are preparing the body. fulfilling his eternal purpose.

The condition of the world today is to look for more wisdom, better class. Yet there is no wisdom that can surpass God.

There is no better class of people on earth than those who can keep God's word. The day you believe the message of the hour is when you become the best an...

amen so and I'm I'm so grateful to see the pastor kicking up again we have been praying of course that he should uh be restored to that is through the love that we have [Applause] for I always say to him that Pastor I I met you before I got married I met you before I got married and he's the one that went to so to get this wife for [Applause] me I'm sure now you will see how the bond is got me a wife he found me being very rocket and he molded me with a weight so now my heart was bored with his [Applause] heart so is quite a lot that we can say maybe I can through [Music] excitement give you a hint we are preparing something in the form of a book that we are writing and then just because of that so it will be a long story to and thank you for your prayers I'm not a man who's taken easily always cries but when it comes to the pastor I [Applause] amen hallelujah amen uh I'm so excited so I'm trying to come my NES [Music] down I want us to sing on a hill far away but we sing it the way we sing it in Malawi not here so we all stand a bit lower should be is slowly I will harm it first so that the singers can catch the you sing it this way [Music] m [Music] [Music] cross the of bring and shame [Music] [Music] rest and for world was [Music] so trop and last night God oh I will I [Music] will for [Music] and cross the world [Music] oh the [Music] than his glory to to so [Applause] [Music] my trophy myop my tropies last [Music] I will to [Music] the in exchange change changeing someday forever amen hallelujah [Applause] uh let's open our Bibles uh to the Book of Genesis amen amen hallelujah amen gen uh chapter 1 verse [Music] 26 and God said let us make money in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the F of the air over the cattle and all over the Earth and all over the creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created a man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female he them hallelujah amen so if you go to Genesis gen Genesis 2:7 [Music] says and the Lord formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his no the Breath of Life The Man became a living Soul amen the Lord bless the leading of his Hallelujah we can be seated amen amen so um as the theologians have been confused for a long time amen amen how many men are here as we read how many men are there uh-uh there's no one day one was created the other one was formed so how many are there two hallelujah amen so there was one from Heaven one and the one who was from the corruption these two were one they were walking together say Amen how many are there two the other one in the image of God the other one from the soil how many are there two the other one from Switzerland the other one from Heaven the other one is Zulu the other one from Heaven the other one is a malawian these two were [Applause] together so these two were together the other one from Heaven the other one from the ground so these two were together to make sure the Heavenly one was able to work because the Heavenly one which was a theop didn't have hands but the one from the soil have hallelujah amen hallelujah amen so hallelujah amen uh you can go to the second slide my brother the uh questions and answers on Hebrews question answers Hebrews that's that's in genis one one I'm waiting for my are the slides there yeah that's that's Genesis one where he created man in his own image which was in a theop and in Genesis 2 he made Man Out of the Dust of the earth which was the human that we know Now understand there now how many are there two but the other one was and the theop doesn't die the other one was from the corruption of the earth which was English American malan the man we know now amen amen hallelujah amen so what what did Adam [Music] loose amen am when he was a fop death had no control of him when Adam was a theop by the time which yes give me that one that's fine my brother give me that one that one which you removed yes amen so the theop if he had a theop a spirit death has got no control of that it had to become fresh that he could take a stinger of death so what lost that day the return back to God D in sin Adam failed to subject himself to the word to subject himself to the word of the [Applause] hour save Eve Adam lost a part of him which was [Applause] eternal which was that part he lost hallelujah amen So Adam was still a Son of God he didn't lose his sunship but he lost stand with a word amen amen Adam couldn't speak anymore as God can speak because he had lost what his we body is the amen so since that time Adam lost we found that there has been a work of restoration to restore the Lost Adam's l hallelujah amen so we find that David wanted God to be very close to him so what did David want to do when he want to go to be close to him he wanted to build him a house so David wanted go to be his neighbor hallelujah amen David loved God so much until he wanted his house to be here God house to be here so whenever he wants God he moves from his house to God's house amen amen so uh when God told him no you canot build me a house but when we come to you can put the it's good that I should us have the slid so that you can have the message before I I preach it okay the next slide please slide just along oh okay yes so David God wanted God to be his neighbor so Solomon wanted to build something which God could dwell in but the Bible says he built a house God does not D in houses built by the hands of men hallelujah amen how B the most high dwells not in the temples made by hands of men there is somewhere else where where God can dwell so when came to the lier Jordan when Jesus was baptized the next slide uh on the River Jordan when Jesus was baptized straight away the heavens opened and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and this is what was spoken by David saying but the body has thou prepared for me and a voice from Heaven saying this is my brother son in whom I am well pred so we see now the Holy Spirit for a long time had never come to be in a man but now came down to dwell in a man the heaven is one of the most brother calls it one of the most greatest events in the message he ye him preached in 1957 1957 then you brother says you wonder what's the matter the greatest event that ever took place on Earth was when Jesus Christ was baptized of John when God came to Earth or sent his son to he represented him as a lamb the lamb is the meest of all animals and he represented himself as a dove and the dove is the meest of all the beds of [Music] Heaven that's why the heavens and only those two people could two species could agree John said behold the lamb of God that take away the sin of the world and I barely could sing the spirit of God like Ave when the son Dove settled down on the lamp what did Spirit on on a lamb not on a dog amen amen not on a god on a lamb so there have to be a lamb for a dve to settle on so a body has to be prepared in such a way that that body is exactly a [Music] lamb not a dog amen amen you know all the habits of a dog amen amen so when God is doing something he prepares and I'm telling you the word prepare means prepare amen amen um sometime you find people I don't want to take the quotation which brother was talking about it but I I will tell you this uh when Jonah on the sea the Bible says God [Music] prepared a fish and uh if you say God prepared that means god prepared you don't have to go and do research a lot of people are thinking that that fish was a shark and then they say it's too small have been maybe a whale but the whale the mouth of the whale is too small how Jah go through you not reading the Bible corlection this not this was not a normal fish this was a fish which God [Applause] prepared so people want to take God in science sometimes they look at the pastor and they say what no no no God prepared the pastor for you don't research him through science medicine you know they're doing research to see which fish swallowed they will never find it well that one was a which God prepared so when God Was preparing for the message to be in South Africa he also prepared you to be here when the message of the hour is here some of us are through Malawi some are through swana but God prepar the body we are supposed to prepare a body in whom God can dwell in amen amen are we preparing a church amen amen amen hallelujah amen it will be very simple to prepare a church for God to come [Applause] in and the people who be here will not be you the people who come R and everybody else who come here say we for going what's your name no no no no you cannot get God be but when God says prepare he ask for something which a normal man cannot do amen this is not for normal man amen amen a normal man canot get rid of sin hallelujah amen a normal man cannot get rid of sin God is asking us to get rid of sin so that he himself can dwell in us God doesn't like politicians everything which you see on Earth was prepared for a purpose the water which we drink the scientists they are wondering how did water come on Earth they wondering where where did the water come from because the Earth came as a m Rock amen amen hallelujah amen it's only now when they discovered that on a certain uh on a certain place in the universe there's a lot of water there amen much more than we have on Earth as it was spoken by the prophet Noah the heavens opened and the water came down by that time they were doing there everything what they were doing to to verify Noah and Noah didn't worry about that Noah ConEd the boat according to the way God told him amen amen H don't think that the people during Noah's time were less inent than you actually you are less intelligent than the people who end the days of Because unless you explain to me how you can cut stones and put them in a pyramid and they should be able to tell you time when they when they go into the sarcophagus I should say they sarcophagus no sophus that means where they bu the pharohs okay where they bu the pharohs the stone which they bued in how it was cut to fit in that tomb you just need a laser gun yes amen how to lift that stone weighing tons and tons go on top of the pyramid we don't have the Machinery right now hallelujah amen because we are living in the days of Noah you know people perhaps you know people perhaps during the time of built boats you remember they had Rockets they could shoot them to the skies but when it came to the time when the flood came they didn't float only Noah was made by God Only When God can make things that's the only thing which you work when the time comes it can work when the time isn't there sorry it can work it can work yes am so I like the message to be God constructed with scriptures hallelujah amen so when when Noah's boat floated all their Rockets couldn't work because the weather had [Applause] changed rain had never been seen before amen amen hallelujah amen the the day the people in the days of Noah uh were very very very educated when as it was in the days of Noah he was saying something which you know that my brother my sister these people were so very sophisticated amen amen and the next slide if you can check out the pyramids of the the coordinates of the pyramids uh the how they are northward you find that the coordinates of the pyramids exactly the speed the speed of light and they are aligned in the star with the Stars in the and mathematically they are aligned with a stone H in England and you'll been wondering if these people were not that intelligent how can all these things be lined up and you can even draw a circle to all the way to the pyamid yes the pyramids which are in Mexico you can draw a line from the pyramids in Egypt all the way and you see that the main thing which was being done there was to observe the skies and that's why brother said they were telling no no water there where are you getting this story that there will be water coming from there they were relying on their scientific research my brother uh in the message is the Paradox Noah's time Noah's day it was the Paradox you remember there had been no rain on Earth the of Noah God watered up the Springs so forth but Noah began to build an ark when there was no evidence that would be rain from the skies and we are building bodies which one day amen we going to to go against is the force of gravity these bodies which you are seeing today we are preparing them s because one day there canot be no scientific evidence how he going to do [Music] it so we are doing the same way Noah did what was he doing before what was he doing before the Paradox ever taken place Noah made preparations for it so which people are going to heaven those who are preparing a body amen amen which people are going to heaven those who are preparing those of you are not preparing we are not going to go no [Music] prepared oh my amen may I say this afternoon if we here today we only prepare for our Paradox the one who can bring is is with us God who all his works is a paradox par past understanding incredible but true no God ready for [Music] it which people going those who are getting imagine in his preparation that people said oh wonder what this old crank is having out there don't you think people tell us names and what and what you people are moving in those long dresses stop wearing long dresses long time [Applause] ago people are laughing at you you are anable they did the same to Noah Noah Was preparing we are preparing because we know when time comes God will pick those who are prepared amen amen I would imagine s would come out to know and say say look here we have instruments that can shoot to the Stars up there how in the world can you your words be true when is it going to rain amen amen hallelujah amen when is The Lure get prepared amen amen hallelujah amen amen amen when Israel came to the Red Sea uh I find even the theologians were talking about uh that no they didn't cross on the sea they cross on the sea of reeds because they cannot believe that God can open SE amen God opened the sea according to Exodus 14:25 God opened the sea the Israelites they passed as if it was dry land that's what the Bible says but when the Egyptians came it was different until the Egyptians themselves said I believe the God of Israel is fighting for them hallelujah amen they said let us free can you give me that one two two strides ahead let us free free oh from the face of Israel for the Lord fight for them hallelujah amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen H don't worry um I want to finish in time so just get the get the quotations you are going to start at home so in the message message who is this says give me that one my brother yes that one yeah yeah that that one the one which you have removed that one predestination predestination is the is the only one that's cons the predestinated predestinated is the only one that's considered in the Redemption did you get it let me say it again the predestinated is the only one that's that is considered in Redemption it's not that one say hey say Jesus is lordus Lord because the Bible says not all who say Lord Lord is going to be but there has to be some predestination how do God predestinate according to his own good will amen amen so only those people who are predestinated are going to catch this word hallelujah amen those who are not PR they will not be able to catch this come sit with us here they will see what is happening they will go back and shake their heads why do you think those people believe in because in them they are not prepared by God you remember God preped from outside you cannot see anything because you are a special preparation hallelujah amen people can't understand you you are a special [Music] preparation amen amen so once you prepare the body then you become closer to the lamb and when you become closer to the lamb the more of the spirit comes in you the more you move back to where Adam moved away from hallelujah amen hallelujah so when God calls the man is not just a man he is a special [Music] preparation amen amen what is it's a word body amen amen you find that in the message life where it says the f is a what a word body hallelujah amen hallelujah amen so and the word body this body the word body is subject to the word of God so you are here the pastor is preaching but your body is not subject to what is preaching you must certainly question yourself because if you are predestinated your body should be subject to the world hallelujah amen theop the let's I want you to have this quotation now we see the attributes of the son of the [Music] spirit this body is subject to the word hallelujah amen what is the body what is body subject to the theop is subject to if you got a closer to you what will you be subject to the hallelujah amen so if you are made of your you be subject so you say how did you I do how did I end up as a sinner in the message says you when you coming here on Earth you byass your but you by that's the message this but you you by and just became a freshman when in the when they call you freshman don't say don't don't accept it you are a man just a body of fresh moving as a to be tempted by sin and when this Tac dissolved we have one already waiting but look when this body de the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside you it throws this body into subjection to [Applause] God amen amen amen amen you know the thean doesn't eat amen amen but when this one day come to pick the the soil which is this body and it will become a glorified body amen amen amen let me jump with slides amen amen so we are subject to the word we are eternal oh my amen everybody is quiet amen amen this one jumped a few slides I don't know what can you go to the slides which have written we are serving his eternal purpose just jump a few slides yeah yes that one amen so being Eternal with him who is being Eternal with him who is being with him amen amen don't look from outside you are going to see things which are not there because uh during the time of Noah they didn't understand Jonah was swallowed by fish they don't understand go and look for this court brother bam says even this fish God might have prepared it for a long time waiting for the time come what happened to that fish after it swalled Jonah we don't care it had done it work it is gone because I would say where is the fish the fish so where is the fish which Peter got the coins from amen amen you know you know the people fail to pay TI to a pastor who is uh who is here tomorrow the other day Abraham PID TI to somebody who was going to dissolve the next hour he gave he gave him money but the next thing he was gone to [Applause] heaven what happened to the ti I don't know amen amen so being Eternal with him the life which you had he which you was his thought which he was he wanted me to stand on the pit are youing there he wanted you talking about no no no me [Applause] he wanted you to sit there today you are seed there by 10 purpose then we are serving his eternal purpose amen amen hallelujah amen so then the one he that left home only come to the Earth to serve his eternal purpose the one who left your home here his eternal purpose is that then amen amen after that will be brought back to glorified amen amen amen amen so in the likeness let me finish in of Propet man says the body has thou uh prepared prepared for me amen so this time around it is you preparing the body it's break back we being brought back to Eternity because once you prepare the body uh the the spe comes on you then you become Eternal that's why we are here making his eternal uh go to the one or two strides Christ and his bride United so the greatest event that which the world has ever seen and we see remember that one the greatest event which the world has ever seen and will see Christ and his church United together what's the greatest event Christ and his churched together amen amen hallelujah amen that's the greatest event when you can M let me finish by saying this the the greatest the best you know people want to be educated better class do that nothing but a bunch of Earth in clothes give me the last slide oness let's just stop a minute yes that one that isn't the condition of the world today they want more [Music] wisdom better class higher education wanting
