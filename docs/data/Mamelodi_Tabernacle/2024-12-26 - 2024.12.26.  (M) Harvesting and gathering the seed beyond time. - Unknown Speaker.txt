farewell yesterday I with my pastor here Pastor Ed we said to go rest because we going to preach tomorrow in the morning meaning today that is how we agreed I I with my pastor and we were expecting him to be here but only in the morning they said he will never be present so because he has not ARR with this past they said no you will have to take that's why you see me here God bless you I believe God will be with us while we stand on I was just trying to explain what happened let's um let's open the book of methew 13 we read verse 24 to 30 Matthew chter 13 verse 24 to 30 another Parable put he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sth good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and saw test among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the test also so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did not thou saw good seed in thy field from whence then have it t he said unto them an enemy ha done this the servant said unto him while thou then that we go and gather them up but he said Nay last while we gather up the test ye root up also the weed with them let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the test and bind them in bundles to bur them but gather the wheat into my bur let's close our our P yes Heavenly Father we de it as a great privilege once again this morning that you have gather us together to yourself father God the good thing which you have done to us today is giving us a gift of life now we have come gathered here looking for that eternal life be with us Lord let our F Finance come closer to us now as we'll be listening from the preach to us through EOP let the EOP Listen to As We committing ourselves into th holy hands in Jesus Christ name we pray amen my will be this one in anding the [Music] seat you see when you take journey in those days you were supposed to know the signs on the road you're supposed to know which sign you going to pass before you reach your destination then when you have passed the first or the second then you know that I'm still I'm still going to pass the fourth the fifth and seven that is how we are in this journey if you don't know where you are you are in trouble because the hares is now and the harvesting is at the end of time and the the G because the harvesting is done by the kumb and then the G is the ging into the elevator and the elevator is the when God is G is using his words and the prophet says he is gathering his Bri them at a place in that place when I read in this book The Prophet says he says um I'm reading this paragraph in the M what time is it that you are living in I said go is together and he's Gathering his his bride because his bride is called his seat and he's called his elect the chosen ones that his sheep then he's gaing them and when he's Gathering them Gathering them at a place because each and every messenger comes at the end of the age and calling the people to come out of that age it means we are also means it means our messenger has come at the end of this age it means you are no more living in that age because he has called us he has called us out if we CL that we living in the P AG means confusion you are not or that's why the messenger came to call us out if he has us out where are we now now the prophet says a time what a time is it that we are living in he says something like a calendar you look at the calendar to find out what day of the year you are living in and you look at God's Bible you see what age we are living in we are not living in the middle of this age Baptist age we are living in the bright age in other words the age Beyond Time because seven Church ages is time because you count from 1 to s that is time then beyond time is the bright H in that you f something there then we are living in the bright age ping bring him back to to God through a channel that is promise to bring it back in God is bringing them back and when he's bringing them is using a channel because the channel is already there you don't need to look for another the prophet said to the one who was taking the step to the other side he said to that that prev of the Bride he said to the ones who were taking the step outside he said to them go back to the line because the line how was start to move inside the line not to start another L that's why he is bringing them back through a CH that he has promised to bring it back in you cannot be brought back in a channel which you don't know what we are not brought back because you must know Channel which channel which you are going to be brought back in he said that channel is promised he promised to do it he said we are not living in a Pentecostal age if you look in that in that pyramid there then we see the top there and above that cross there is the bright AG is beyond time because Beyond time is the ministry of the white stone because it was the ministry of the theop to get the Revelation the the the interpretation of that W Stone to go to the west to to connect to with the the because he got that interpretation inside the pyramid the Pyramid of the angel and those Angel were Celestial angel then when we reach there that is the the dispense another dispensation and that dispensation is the dispensation of the revelation of the son of [Applause] man that bright age is the dispensation of the revelation of the son of man and if it is the revelation of the if it is the dispensation of the revelation of the son of man it means it's the re it's the dispensation of M you meet in the bright age because through seven Church ages he came in three son name he came as a son of man and Son of God he will come son of David he will come son of David in the millenum in Palestine there when he was born there called Jesus he was the son of man because he said to his disciples who do men say I the son of men he call himself the son of men through seven church after his death and Resurrection he took another form then he came as a Son of God through seven Church ages he was a Son of God no more son of but Son of God the end now come again as a son of men where I am now he is the son of men he is the son of men is this what the pastor you make form of a prophet because the son of man is revealed himself through the prophet now this age here is the age of the revelation of the son of man is the age of the is the age of the eating of the Hidden man that is the age of the eating of the food because the prophet said you must fit on the we now now we are feeding on the bo we and if are not feeding on the bo M you are not part of the Bri because the bright now must fit on the body weight why should he Feit on the body weight so that he can be ready to fly where the carass is together because the IG must e the they must eat the fresh meat not the meat which de yesterday the me of today am the difference between the and the vulture and the vulture is because the Eagles the V are eating rotten food they cannot fly like the E amen you you meet we meet here supernaturally we we we don't meet him corporally but we meet him supernaturally that's why he said something from within me but you cannot meet because he coming when he's descending he descended with a shout a voice and a trampet when he descending he Wasing and they left him on the space there they came here on Earth and we are going to meet him there there but here we must meet him super and you cannot meet him if you have not meet him super now amen he's Gathering them together in a place we are living here to the bright age the calling out of the church and getting it together for the Rapture that is the age that you are living in now to my honest opinion that is exactly the truth you see when he was revealing himself through seven churches he was the son of God and the Son of God was the Holy Spirit building his church when he finished building his church then he changed another dispensation he was here building his church the form of the Holy Ghost the rain so that the seed must can can germinate and grow and the end there is no more the Holy Ghost no more the Son of God Chang there but now when you talk about the Holy Ghost there but you must know what what is the Holy Ghost you must not talk like the you must not talk like people who who who they don't know where the holy ghost is now our anointing now it's a different anointing it's not like the anointing during seven Church the anointing is different because the anointing of the son of man it is the pillar of fire [Applause] anointing during 7ch when they were asking you whether you are a Christian they would say have you received the Holy Ghost since you but it's not the case now now when we meet you say have you [Applause] met all right let's just go on Amen he's Gathering his people if you are there in the Bre Bre no you are going to be raptured if you are living there you are in the bright age the bright age is the is the Raptor aane in other words if you are there in the bright age in the thise started the first church age people now it is here in the run away waiting the mechanics are ready waiting for the Dynamics [Applause] dnamic we are where we are now because of the message of he said we have said the prophet was the messenger a messenger is important when he's caring that message because he's he's caring the message to a from point A to point B when he's caring the message important but when you deliver the message he is no more important what is important is what he has delivered and we must know where he has delivered it he said himself this is the secret the way I was caring I have delivered it is in the bright now you must look where the weight [Applause] is he's ging using the voice and the of God is the Sheep and the voice the voice is the word of God and the word of God is the Cass and we must feed on the Cass so that you can fly then the is the way of the god of the season and the way of God of the season is the message Beyond age it's the message Beyond time that is the message that is the the word of God of the [Music] season when he is when he's bringing his voice he is bringing his way through his God send teachers [Music] listen in eache predestinated there must be a messenger there one messenger for that age under each messenger there are pastors there P that [Applause] messenger they must be the ones who has been taught Faithfully from the from the messenger because they must be Shepherd to Fe the when they feed the sheep they must feed the sheep with the Sheep fot [Applause] because the prophet the messenger has brought the food down and has left the food for the for the for the shepherd to pick up the food and the Sheep because the Sheep are not his God's sheep when when you say you are a Shepherd it's because the great Shepherd is in you can be a Shepherd that Shepherd is [Applause] not how can you find the food sheep food if you don't have a Shepherd in you must have a Shepherd he must be the one who's feeding his sheep she his wife they Shepherd's [Applause] voice this Shepherd here because the resurrection because the resurrection when it is coming it will be like a wave it will be the messengers and and under them with their pastors then from from there and the Sheep under the P that the resurrection if you don't have a shepher you are not sheep there is no sheep sheer of sheep work the Revelation given to a ship is for the ship to rec his Shepherd that is the Revelation given to a she can give can you give me a was please amen when he is doing this he is using his Shepherds amen because let me see what the prophet is saying here let me read page 381 here I want to read I to read it says here in the middle of this paragraph he say this is the reason for all preaching and teaching this this is the reason for all preaching and teaching it is in the preaching and teaching of the W that the sheep can hear the voice and follow him where does the sheep hear the voice from and theing and the sheep can hear the voice not on the mountain not fasting for seven days days but from some [Music] here if you want to hear him you must not go to the mountain come to me you hear him thank you my pastor God bless you when you go to the Satan sat is operating three SPH in the space that's the reason Paul says we are fighting with the spirits in the spirit in the in the SP we are fighting with the spirits which are there the spirits which are there and they are also fighting on the earth here and they are also fighting down there [Applause] all right let's just go on first it is in preaching and teaching where where where the sheep hear the voice of God and teaching and the preaching is the former ring because we have the former and the L the teaching for and the former is leading to the L is the harest ring but the former ring must come three seeds have been sold three three seeds has been sold one SE the denominational seat the the head [Music] there and another seat is a pcal seat and the head is oral another the third one is the SE is the weight and the head the SEL mess those seeds are planted and they must we have said false teachers are making this wrong f to come to maturity they come to maturity through these false teachers and if these false teachers are making these false making them to to be mature this seats true teachers must make this true all the seeds are planted now we are waiting for the the message of B the world the message the world and the weight has the world the world the prophet went through the world seven times that the world the world knows about the weight now what are we waiting for now we are waiting for the the lomom time the there were two Hest the Angels after the angels and the Lord disappeared then S and B it was the harest I said there were two H after the angels and the Lord disappeared then s b and you together with me then Abraham received this promise these ones bent it was their results it was their fruits this one received his prise har the l l to [Music] Abraham the promis fire [Music] there two har produced by the L when the Angel and the Lord disappear you see those two angels were represented by the one the one who stays with Abraham wased through the prophet amen when they disappear where are you now because when they disappear said don't bend disappear Abed are now thank we are in the place where we are now the two we at the end time the L rain is fixing to come forth the Ling is the harest the former rain has passed teaching R it has passed now we are waiting for the latter and the latter R is the Harvest and the Harvest r which is the World Council of churches me don't think these people understand hear me I say the former pass this is the secret the weight is in the amen the revelation of the we them but the seven SE when it is open brought them back [Applause] God bless you amen it brought our back it says it is not this outside this is subject to death it will die but the inside part of you in there inside that is that is the person that cannot die and that person that is where the new B start from it builds another person in the image of this person you are around that life potentially it is in here we promise before the foundation of the world around there this only reflect the [Music] negative the negative this one reflect the negative that one will ref reflect the positive the weight and the same thing is or the translation of the bread will be the same thing is in you the body will matal around that weight the same thing did by S are you listening he he said this is the secret the weight is in the he said the same thing the weight will will materialize inside you like materal amen he said the change with it didn't just happen outside It Started From Within because Sarah was even if she could be young she will remain but God must start taking out the bar then bring so that sah can be fruitful amen with you what must start from within and change fromin the must materialize within you when the we is grow with this will just finish you receive because those we have got three theal body is operating here theop the is operating the six Dimension is is we are waiting is a waiting period blessed are they who died in Christ they arresting they arresting because they died in Christ they are in the six dimension they resting there waiting for him to he will move from the and took those in the and come down and they will move and come down they will change their theop state and put into the glorified in other words the theop will get into the into the then you cannot receive the glorified if you don't [Applause] have they cannot receive a glorified body in their theop and you receive the glorified while you don't have not [Applause] your all right the the l r is the Harvest ring and the Harvest R is theine and theine is the hares and the harest Machine is is the World Council of churches the prophet says he says I'm hearing I'm hearing the sound the sound of the cumbine the prophet said there he was not just talking he was hearing the S of the K coming to harvest harvesting and the seat be time let me read it here he says I'm hearing the sound of the to harvest the SI because the sick has reached it majority he said I hear something I hear the coming of the kumb the world cancel the world cancel she will separate it what does she do sh off her stock but she's got an elevator waiting you you for her she will go home one of these days one of this morning you will understand say Amen she's she's hearing the the sound of the kumbai coming the seventh angel messenger says here let me read something here are you together with me he says um we are at the end time the seeds are sold now the latter rain is fixing to come for which is the harest he says remember there will be such a denominational Gathering pretty soon it will be terrific they will bring themselves together into this Federation of churches I was telling you I think yesterday we are putting our sacrifice on the altars we are already putting on the altars because everyone says I'm right anding the right amen but now we we have we have placed our sacrifice on the altar The Showdown will come and others they they placed their old and The Showdown came to show which one is the right sacrifice and even now the show you come to show let me he says they bring themselves together into the this Federation of church then this kind of a church will be put out of operation as far as they know every time it is every time that Jesus will appear he will show which is the bright [Applause] and he call he is's calling it The M [Music] show let me in the middle because he's talk about The Showdown of Elijah down because they refused then the show came he said during Jesus time the phes refused him they show was the Transfiguration he says Jesus came and had the M Transfiguration show down this for of the last days for the former Jesus Will Be The Showdown Jesus will be the showdown between denomination which is his we when he comes down the Rapture of his bride the first was M cam the second was M trans the third will be m he will come and show which one is the bright and which one is not remember remember Christian friends I'm a man I can make mistake but God being God cannot make a mistake all the way all the wordss that has been written must be fulfilled Jesus said so so we got things here in the scripture that must be fulfilled and that is one of the things this boycot to come you know this boy is one of the things which is written the scripture that must come are you with me here let me read something here first I want to read something here it says here it is in this age that the churches are going to come together the L and as they are even now controlling the world politics they will soon control the finances of the world um and then you will you if you don't belong to the world organization [Music] you will never be able to buy or you will lose all those who stay true to God and keep their garments clean from the defilement of the world system of church orders of church orders will be physically Direct there will be presented to them a great temptation to give in Preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the Antichrist be system they will give in will [Music] give it is already formed what it is waiting the mechanics Dynamics when the Dynamics has come then it will start his work he says I read it in the middle when it becom so strong politically that she best pressure upon them the the government all to join with either directly or through adherence to principle ined in the law so no people will be recognized as an actual church let me read somewhere above there yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it will be so very right and enlightening and giving light only the elect will not be fooled amen I want read something
