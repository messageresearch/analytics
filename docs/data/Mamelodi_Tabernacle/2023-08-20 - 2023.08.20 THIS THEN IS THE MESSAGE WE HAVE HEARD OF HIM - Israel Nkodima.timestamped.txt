[8:27] thank you sir
[8:31] that which we have heard
[8:39] since the seventh seal was revealed
[8:44] as it was revealed
[8:50] as you know
[8:52] the prophet says it was revealed in a
[8:56] three-fold
[8:57] Mysteries
[9:01] and maybe we we all know what it means
[9:07] free food
[9:12] mystery means
[9:16] amen amen can we go back and
[9:20] foreign
[10:29] uh we were the pride of Christ
[10:34] has revealed
[10:37] yeah the seventh seals shall be revealed
[10:41] around the time the Lord Jesus Will
[10:45] appears
[10:47] this is what he says
[10:50] on Earth again
[11:00] um
[11:08] I'm going to read something here
[11:12] The Bride is the word um
[11:18] that's why
[11:20] there's no confusion with the bride of
[11:22] Christ
[11:25] because
[11:27] the bread of Christ foreign
[11:49] [Music]
[11:53] amen amen now because
[11:56] he hasn't come to start a new thing
[12:00] oh man he's still dealing with those
[12:03] beings
[12:05] those spirits
[12:08] that were with him before the foundation
[12:11] of the world
[12:14] that there's no confusion
[12:17] all right amen now I'm going we are
[12:21] going to look into the world
[12:25] and see what he has for us today we
[12:33] I want to thank him for being with us
[12:37] okay amen this morning
[12:42] I believe that
[12:44] we are not here to repeat
[12:48] things
[12:52] as we start from back there
[13:01] amen amen now in the beginning was the
[13:04] word
[13:06] now if we are going to look at that
[13:08] which was
[13:13] the new things
[13:16] the ministry of the pride it's not a new
[13:20] ministry
[13:21] it is it was them from the beginning
[13:27] that's why there's no confusion in the
[13:30] bride of Christ
[13:33] amen amen we don't have meetings to try
[13:38] to resolve things
[13:40] the meeting that we have is with him
[13:43] yeah
[13:47] and if we are receiving from him
[13:52] we are receiving the very same way
[13:55] which we have it from him
[13:59] from the beginning
[14:01] in the beginning was the way
[14:05] all right so I'm going to read some
[14:10] things I I won't belong
[14:14] um even if the wrist watch gives me more
[14:18] time here
[14:21] all right now yesterday
[14:24] we looked at that part
[14:28] where it speaks of like the battle of
[14:32] Armageddon things like this
[14:36] and which brother Branham says
[14:41] that battle started way back and
[14:46] Beyond Time
[14:50] I asked a question yesterday
[14:53] [Music]
[14:56] have you ever hit somebody talking about
[14:59] or preaching about the Battle foreign
[15:07] oh no
[15:08] right
[15:10] but is there somebody who spoke or I
[15:14] preached
[15:15] that subject
[15:19] but otherwise you have never
[15:22] heard from any other person
[15:26] preaching about the battle of Armageddon
[15:29] is uh
[15:35] I was asking a brother
[15:37] while we are repeating things
[15:40] we can preach the message that was
[15:44] preached
[15:46] I mean maybe to remind ourselves and so
[15:49] forth
[15:50] but things like the battle of Armageddon
[15:57] it seems like
[16:00] no one is trying to touch that
[16:04] I'll tell you why
[16:07] because brother Brendan says
[16:15] is
[16:18] [Music]
[16:33] he says way back Beyond time
[16:38] now if we were we we are going to see
[16:43] things that are Beyond time
[16:47] that would be that what that would mean
[16:50] the things that are Beyond time
[16:53] we're seen Beyond Time
[16:58] let me put it in the right way the
[17:02] battle that started I read
[17:05] way back
[17:07] Beyond time yeah so you have Beyond time
[17:14] and you have Beyond time
[17:18] let us put it in this way from Beyond
[17:22] Time
[17:29] and so now why
[17:33] are the two changes our in progress
[17:38] it was a time
[17:42] but
[17:44] this seven Church ages
[17:50] we are no longer in the seven churches
[17:59] Ministry has changed
[18:01] because
[18:03] seven churches
[18:08] but when you come to the seventh then
[18:12] you are going Beyond time
[18:16] now I think that is beyond time
[18:21] can be seen
[18:36] then over this this time which is which
[18:40] is ages
[18:46] maybe I'm going to let me read here the
[18:52] battle that started way back
[18:56] Beyond Time
[18:58] back before Before Time started or
[19:02] beginning
[19:04] and it says then it is Satan and disease
[19:11] and then they they came to the earth and
[19:15] the battle set at
[19:22] okay I will
[19:24] stop there
[19:26] okay now I'm saying
[19:30] uh I've never seen or read from somebody
[19:37] repeating this
[19:41] it was
[19:43] started Beyond time
[19:46] all right now you will understand that
[19:50] today there's so much confusion in the
[19:53] world
[19:57] like this threefold revelation of God
[20:02] the threefold is
[20:06] cod tells you here it is
[20:17] [Music]
[20:20] Utica
[20:22] the logos logos
[20:26] if I go back to
[20:30] the
[20:33] Cod now we've got it like this
[20:41] logos logos
[20:46] amen amen now that is
[20:54] that but these things are only
[20:57] understood
[21:01] amen by this threefold Revelations
[21:07] now why threefold
[21:11] God logos the men
[21:18] now if he says he says the 16 th did you
[21:23] understand that's revealed in a
[21:26] three-fold
[21:29] then he said the seventh seals was also
[21:34] revealed
[21:36] threefold
[21:38] now threefold meaning
[21:47] now if the bride is part of the
[21:50] threefold
[21:57] is part of the word of God
[22:02] in the third food
[22:06] that's why he speaks of the uh
[22:10] the pools
[22:20] um
[22:21] everybody's wondering
[22:24] what is the third pool
[22:29] because
[22:31] everything is comes in three
[22:35] now if you looking at these pools
[22:40] you'll find brother brand name is
[22:44] even if I read from a book here
[22:48] about this let's try to look into these
[22:51] things this
[23:00] is
[23:12] okay now if it was fought Beyond time
[23:22] as the prophet says even
[23:34] that would feel
[23:37] finished
[24:00] uh
[24:05] this he says now we find that the six
[24:09] seal once might you understand that has
[24:11] been opened fully well to us
[24:16] then if you ask what is the sixth year
[24:19] oh yeah
[24:25] that is Moses and Elijah Moses
[24:29] that is the sixth series
[24:32] now we are on
[24:35] is winning
[24:37] yeah
[24:42] amen amen now now the whole world is
[24:45] full of preachers
[24:56] that's the difference from just being a
[24:59] church
[25:01] that's why I'm speaking not to a child
[25:05] speaking to the bride
[25:07] because we have so many churches
[25:10] with different doctrines
[25:13] the word of God Elizabeth
[25:17] it is not revealed it is
[25:22] the word of God
[25:25] now so if we you come here into
[25:29] something without conclusion
[25:32] it is revealed it is
[25:40] now which one is
[25:42] amen
[25:50] [Music]
[25:57] now what we must receive okay we must
[26:01] see the word of God
[26:04] from the people you see a cities
[26:25] before the foundation of the world
[26:28] know whether it is
[26:51] has been opened to us
[26:54] we see it
[26:57] what what do we see
[27:00] Moses
[27:03] in the revelation of that sixth seal
[27:06] this is
[27:08] referring to the Jews
[27:22] in open open
[27:24] to us
[27:26] we see it
[27:30] amen amen and we know that fiasba these
[27:34] seven
[27:36] and not be broke
[27:39] to the public
[27:43] foreign
[28:04] [Applause]
[28:13] that is the bride of Christ
[28:15] amen amen and
[28:18] right now I'm looking at this
[28:22] um
[28:23] it is open to us
[28:26] we see it
[28:29] and we know that the seventh yeah
[28:34] cannot be broke to the public
[28:38] until that hour all right
[28:44] so then he continued
[28:48] so we see that
[28:52] it is a complete mystery
[28:57] therefore
[28:59] is not yet for the mystery to be known
[29:05] as he is referring to the seventh seal
[29:08] hotel
[29:09] that cannot be broke to the public
[29:13] what is the public yeah
[29:20] I mean
[29:22] you have the public and you have the
[29:25] price
[29:27] that's the difference
[29:29] is
[29:35] all the churches
[29:42] so to them it is
[29:45] then he continues
[29:47] when the seventh sea when when he opened
[29:51] the seventh sealed I mean he's been
[29:56] there but now opened
[30:00] the seventh it says eating he also
[30:05] omitted it again
[30:07] so we see that it is a complete mystery
[30:32] [Music]
[30:34] right around about the time that Jesus
[30:38] appears on the earth
[30:42] so he said it will be this mystery
[30:47] be known
[30:50] right about malunga the time that the
[30:54] Lord Jesus
[31:00] again for his for his bride
[31:04] appears for his brothers
[31:07] or whatever takes place
[32:00] [Music]
[32:08] Christ through uh
[32:22] Satan holds the Beast
[32:25] also has three and a half years
[32:30] we call tribulation period yes it is
[32:35] now what is left now
[32:38] that three and a half years
[32:44] [Applause]
[32:46] did you know where we are now
[32:49] what is coming now
[32:52] to the world
[33:02] so because the Rapture please don't take
[33:06] in place yet
[33:07] the Rapture is coming
[33:10] very very very soon
[33:16] we have seen all these signs
[33:19] leading to the Rapture of the price
[33:29] we have the three and a half years of
[33:31] the Lord Jesus Christ
[33:34] the last one is the three and a half
[33:37] years of Satan
[33:42] both Ministries
[34:03] then uh
[34:06] when is it coming
[34:09] when it is coming is a needy already if
[34:13] we look at the signs uh
[34:24] the people are standing up against the
[34:27] Lord Jesus Christ
[34:30] in America America some people were
[34:33] arrested for preaching Christ
[34:36] too and that's why they say America
[34:39] America is a
[34:42] [Music]
[34:43] um
[34:52] children can change
[35:07] [Music]
[35:54] foreign
[35:57] Genesis chapter 19 from verse 27 God
[36:00] bless you and Abraham got up early in
[36:04] the morning to the place where he stood
[36:06] before the Lord and he looked towards
[36:09] Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the
[36:11] land of the plane and beheld and low the
[36:15] smoke of the country went up as the
[36:17] smoke of a furnace
[36:35] up in
[36:41] for the Lord
[36:45] do you hear the scripture
[36:48] like us we stood before the Lord goes
[36:53] way back
[36:57] let's talk about predestination
[37:01] now we stood before the Lord that's why
[37:05] even today to see these things
[37:09] we have taken our positions
[37:13] [Music]
[37:17] we have seen before the foundation
[37:22] because the true bread of Christ
[37:25] is this
[37:28] before the foundation
[37:33] that's why we don't go to study in order
[37:36] we are receiving we have received a
[37:40] revelation
[37:43] foreign
[38:32] foreign
[38:38] it's not some new Souls
[38:45] of those who were with him
[38:49] for the foundation of the world
[38:55] did not send a new camera
[39:00] [Applause]
[39:01] not use a new camera
[39:04] no if he sent out to somebody
[39:09] he was sent out from the be from before
[39:12] the beginning
[39:15] because the message yesterday
[39:24] [Applause]
[39:48] it can only be scientific
[39:51] but there's another body within a body
[39:57] Chico
[40:05] not scientific
[40:06] this is the word of God so now this is
[40:10] what we are looking at
[40:13] um
[40:23] why because they believe that
[40:26] they are educated
[40:28] but now we don't need
[40:31] the ministry of an educated man
[40:43] it doesn't come through education
[40:46] it is
[40:52] [Applause]
[40:55] now we have the last we don't have the
[40:59] last three and we have eternal life
[41:03] okay now I'm going to read something
[41:08] here
[41:09] what the Bible says
[41:13] is that a Revelation chapter four
[41:18] do you know where we are now yeah
[41:21] all right we are not in a church age

[1:11:36] foreign
[1:12:11] foreign yes
[1:12:16] hated his brother foreign
[1:12:20] just because the brother was righteous
[1:12:24] now
[1:12:27] hatred comes into this way
[1:12:36] to act like
[1:12:40] he wanted to convince
[1:12:43] is
[1:12:52] he who hates his brother
[1:13:00] I remember of a brother I was told
[1:13:06] um
[1:13:14] um you know I just smile and pray for
[1:13:18] the brother
[1:13:22] to me he still remained my brother
[1:13:25] then after that I think in two weeks or
[1:13:29] three weeks after that
[1:13:33] so I saw the brother
[1:13:45] I was happy for you
[1:13:49] so
[1:13:50] then when he saw me I'm born and Caesar
[1:13:53] he was trying to go that way

[1:14:06] I said God bless you brother
[1:14:09] yes I am how's the children
[1:14:15] he expected me to say why you say I've
[1:14:18] got it
[1:14:20] I wouldn't say that again
[1:14:32] I freed him from that bondage
[1:14:36] then we were talking there all day at
[1:14:39] the wedding there
[1:14:43] just in my heart there was that desire
[1:14:46] to help my brother
[1:14:49] because it is the devil who said

[1:20:27] Euphrates
[1:20:29] some people don't care about these
[1:20:31] things
[1:20:33] but to us it is
[1:20:36] in the Bible that
[1:20:40] when you see the river Euphrates
[1:20:46] opening the way for the king of the East
[1:20:51] become a road now
[1:20:56] as it is drying up
[1:21:02] is becoming a way
[1:21:05] and the Bible says
[1:21:08] where do you find it in the Bible
[1:21:16] yes
[1:21:18] and the sixth Angel poured out his vial
[1:21:22] upon the great river Euphrates and the
[1:21:25] water thereof was dried up that the way
[1:21:28] of the kings of the East might be
[1:21:30] prepared

[1:22:40] after the Rapture
[1:22:45] he must first take his wife out
[1:22:49] before this trouble
[1:22:57] I've been going around
[1:22:59] trying to talk to the people

[1:24:46] amen did you understand
[1:24:51] last time
[1:24:53] we were
[1:24:55] where's the place now where we were in
[1:24:57] Congo
[1:25:02] then Satan attacked
[1:25:05] um
[1:25:08] the witnesses brother my city he was
[1:25:11] close to me
[1:25:16] and uh actually they were trying to
[1:25:19] strangle some three children
[1:25:25] you know these people of money rituals
[1:25:29] it was the money
[1:25:31] and
[1:25:34] now today in the world
[1:25:37] people want money
[1:25:41] and now they they they they go through
[1:25:45] this money rituals

[1:26:07] you if you want money money then he will
[1:26:12] say without you
[1:26:14] get me a social child
[1:26:19] and
[1:26:20] you know there are things here
[1:26:23] before I close here
[1:26:27] there was a little girl
[1:26:30] she came to my house yes I've got
[1:26:34] witnesses to that
[1:26:37] to tell me about their stories
[1:26:43] how
[1:26:48] he said
[1:26:50] [Music]
[1:26:53] she she used to take us to the see oh
[1:27:00] you know what the sea he has a laundry
[1:27:03] The Hiding Place
[1:27:08] uh
[1:27:20] then I asked him do you know Satan
[1:27:24] then she said
[1:27:26] yes
[1:27:29] I said that how is he
[1:27:34] he said no he changes
[1:27:37] and then sometimes one leg is of a goat
[1:27:41] and the other one is so far
[1:27:46] even in his face sometimes he covers his
[1:27:50] face
[1:27:54] not trying to
[1:27:56] let me not mention some names
[1:28:04] get engaged in some meetings
[1:28:11] all right maybe you don't know about
[1:28:14] this now the people just know Satan as a
[1:28:17] spirit
[1:28:20] but these people how about you they even
[1:28:23] hold meetings
[1:28:27] I'm trying not to name anything
[1:28:30] of these things

[1:28:47] one man and you know with a big
[1:28:50] following
[1:28:53] he also operates
[1:28:56] from down there
[1:29:00] now you can see that to some other
[1:29:02] people
[1:29:05] I've tried to talk to a certain man of
[1:29:09] God
[1:29:10] and he told me that there's no such a
[1:29:13] thing
[1:29:17] because
[1:29:25] he will get drowned
[1:29:29] and I said that but the Bible Revelation
[1:29:32] 13.
[1:29:33] says the Beast came out
[1:29:38] all day
[1:29:39] that that was not a lion yeah it was
[1:29:43] referring to yeah

[1:29:51] things
[1:29:54] you know we are
[1:29:58] blessed this is
[1:30:00] because we know Satan

[1:30:44] they are in love with money
[1:30:49] and I know the Love of Money leads to
[1:30:52] lies
[1:30:56] because the money lover is a liar
[1:31:02] oh
[1:31:06] we don't
[1:31:08] mention
[1:31:10] things as his business

[1:31:23] people
[1:31:25] okay money loversed

[1:32:32] God bless you
[1:32:35] but the Beast shall come out of the
[1:32:38] City

[1:34:27] even in the Bible believe the sons of
[1:34:30] God came together
[1:34:34] Saturn would also appears yeah
[1:34:38] until God says
[1:34:41] what about you we're now turning away
[1:34:45] amen he recognized him
[1:34:50] that's why the children of God
[1:34:58] now I'm trying to say to you
[1:35:03] this river Euphrates
[1:35:06] uh they they have heard some songs
[1:35:10] coming out of them Barbies and yes it is
[1:35:17] one day will especially
[1:35:20] speak about this
[1:35:23] is
[1:35:28] one of the Great Signs of the entire
[1:35:32] world
[1:35:35] now those fallen angels
[1:35:41] demons
[1:35:47] now I will repeat again
[1:35:54] they killed the Jews during the second
[1:35:56] daughter
[1:35:59] now some people think that we do are
[1:36:03] some creatures with some horns
[1:36:07] it was in the form of the German the
[1:36:11] Germans
[1:36:15] but
[1:36:17] uh
[1:36:18] these demons
[1:36:20] anointed
[1:36:24] in the form of this story soldiers
[1:36:33] those demons
[1:36:39] don't you think that do not think that
[1:36:43] they will come with horns
[1:36:48] uniform
[1:36:57] because
[1:36:58] when the pride goes up from
[1:37:01] Satan comes down
[1:37:06] you know that yes London he's being
[1:37:08] operating
[1:37:09] the Bible says
[1:37:12] but in the Heavenly places
[1:37:16] because in heaven was cast out
[1:37:33] Revelation chapter
[1:37:36] 12 12.
[1:37:38] I'm sorry brother I'm sorry you know
[1:37:41] even I don't know when was it I
[1:37:46] continue to say Revelations

[1:37:52] uh
[1:37:53] trying to put me was online
[1:37:57] Revelation
[1:37:59] 12.12 but you remember we spoke about
[1:38:02] this yesterday

[1:38:07] you've got you can write on a paper
[1:38:12] this is revelation 12. with 0 12 yeah
[1:38:17] that would not be like to undermine
[1:38:22] if I'm a pastor
[1:38:26] it happened even in Congo recently
[1:38:31] I said
[1:38:33] that
[1:38:35] feeling
[1:38:36] and people were just looking at me
[1:38:42] you get what I mean
[1:38:43] somebody
[1:38:45] rituals uh
[1:38:55] foreign

[1:40:54] God has given us that
[1:40:57] in order who goes there to fight still
[1:41:01] Soldier is trained
[1:41:06] and a soldier
[1:41:08] will undergo a training
[1:41:15] he is the
[1:41:19] are put on a training
[1:41:24] I mean to train him to know the enemy
[1:41:32] you can't fight an enemy you don't know
[1:41:37] I mean but never never
[1:41:40] take any brother sister
[1:41:45] even if he is against you
[1:41:48] he's not against you
[1:41:54] ever make her or him your enemies
[1:42:01] and that's why he says love those who
[1:42:05] hate you

[1:56:42] the
[1:56:44] but nobody according to set before a
[1:56:49] propheti because

[2:01:04] because
[2:01:09] what did he do he left
[2:01:13] forfeited
[2:01:22] and God Boutique no
[2:01:25] came to you and me
[2:01:29] but of this Prophet what he says is
[2:01:35] I preach on this
[2:01:37] but only to realize that the people
[2:01:43] can't reach this place
[2:01:47] what is
[2:01:51] standing in the game it is because
[2:01:55] foreign
[2:02:08] who who took the book from the one
[2:02:12] what happens there was this one on the
[2:02:15] throne
[2:02:16] and one came and took the book
[2:02:21] now the reason this is that the Rapture
[2:02:24] is so close I
[2:02:39] to take back the book
[2:02:44] that's why it says
[2:02:54] there was no one one who was
[2:02:59] if
[2:03:04] if you you you you have a wonderful
[2:03:07] story
[2:03:10] when there was no one need to take the
[2:03:14] book
[2:03:15] yes
[2:03:18] it is
[2:03:36] he acted in this way
[2:03:39] he he took the book write about English
[2:03:42] from the one who sat on the throne
[2:03:47] who is this one who said on the throne
[2:03:55] within himself
[2:04:18] I could be waiting now
[2:04:22] there's one on the throne no electronics
[2:04:25] no it says it is
[2:04:40] [Applause]
[2:04:43] how is that Johnny do you believe it
[2:04:48] because
[2:04:50] the first rule
[2:04:53] he showed us yes was in
[2:04:59] Missouri
[2:05:12] running
[2:05:25] [Applause]
[2:05:27] amen amen first thrown in heaven
[2:05:30] in Jesus
[2:05:34] thank God for the prophets
[2:05:39] now I know
[2:05:42] that's why you know the book was in
[2:05:45] heaven
[2:05:46] and the book was coming down
[2:05:58] do you know which book is that yeah
[2:06:14] there was the one who sat on the throne
[2:06:18] with the book in his
[2:06:21] right yeah
[2:06:33] um
[2:06:34] I think they are political
[2:06:38] I say that
[2:06:41] in Swaziland in Swaziland he says
[2:06:46] now
[2:06:49] yes
[2:06:55] it's not that in Swaziland Swaziland
[2:07:02] there was a book
[2:07:06] in the hand if only a right hands
[2:07:10] of the one that said on Earth I
[2:07:17] I read yes
[2:07:19] what what
[2:07:21] I don't know and yeah are you ready to
[2:07:24] believe it
[2:07:26] [Applause]
[2:07:28] how did he open the seals
[2:07:34] you know John yes
[2:07:37] John look at the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:07:42] Behold bonani the Lamb of God
[2:07:46] that taketh away the sin of the world
[2:07:53] the Forerunner um
[2:07:57] the foreign
[2:08:13] foreign
[2:08:39] [Music]
[2:08:44] and
[2:08:46] even up to today
[2:08:48] you ask any person what does this means
[2:08:55] foreign
[2:09:25] again
[2:09:31] should I tell you which is
[2:09:35] Adam
[2:09:36] forfeited
[2:09:38] he left was
[2:09:42] because
[2:09:44] I will avoid to read because
[2:09:51] in your book Christ is the mystery of
[2:09:54] God reveals
[2:10:08] that's God's system
[2:10:10] for he said let us make men image
[2:10:17] [Music]
[2:10:19] so from there and the man dropped um and
[2:10:24] it left
[2:10:26] again
[2:10:28] that's why he says
[2:10:33] no one that man dropped Adam to Adam so
[2:10:37] he left again
[2:10:51] and that is the place of God of men
[2:10:58] it would be like a God Was Defeated
[2:11:02] if there is no restoration
[2:11:07] closing of the game
[2:11:13] then what he did Wednesday if then it
[2:11:16] was
[2:11:18] to place a man
[2:11:22] [Applause]
[2:11:23] foreign
[2:11:53] only to
[2:11:55] draw back again because the people can
[2:11:58] really grasp and see it
[2:12:03] just like things like Gogan makeup
[2:12:06] foreign
[2:12:24] do you have
[2:12:30] one of them
[2:12:33] one on the White Horse

[2:14:30] called the word of God and the armies
[2:14:33] which were in heaven followed him upon
[2:14:36] white horses right before you continue
[2:14:45] and the pride says amen tells you that
[2:14:49] that and which was in heaven
[2:14:53] some of them are just here
[2:14:56] but after the rap Champion he organized
