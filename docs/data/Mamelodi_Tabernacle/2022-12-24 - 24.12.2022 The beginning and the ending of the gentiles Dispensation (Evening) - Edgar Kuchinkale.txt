Description:
Title: The Beginnings and Ending of the Gentile Desperation. Preached by Pastor Edgar Kuchinkale from Malawi invited by Pastor Israel Nkodima.
Date: 24-12-2022 (A)

The purpose of this sermon was to teach the audience that the man that God created in the beginning was created in the image and likeness of God. Gen 1: 26. But in the processes, man believed a different message and they found themselves undressed. They sort some means to cover themselves, but their covering was good as long as God was not present. The only time you'll know if what you believe and do is right or wrong is when God comes. He also reads Genesis 3: 1- 8, showing that the voice of God in the garden was walking, and today, the voice of God should walk among our communities.

He further reads Daniel 1: 3 - 8 to encourage the audience that we need to purpose in our hearts to stand with what we believe, which is the word of God. Like Daniel who purposed in his heart not to defile himself.

He takes reference from the book: 55-0109E -  Beginning And Ending Of The Gentile Dispensation
  
21 But He still had a believer that He could put His hands on, and say, “This is My servant.”
22 God has always had a witness, somewhere. He never leaves Hisself without a witness. No matter, it has got down sometime to just one, but He’s always had somebody that He could put His hands on, and say, “This is My servant, and he’ll do as I tell him.” Now, we like that

mother amen so I cannot get tired of the uh the upbringing which we have had a amen amen so without saying much let's go back to the word because I'll be I'll be leading a little bit faster speedy I want a first leader to be also be a little bit faster because otherwise I will be out of here by midnight amen amen we don't worry about going home at midnight there was some yeah Qatar their people would go to the stadium at 10 when the football would be at 10 at night so they would wait for the football for all the time and they don't get tired we are better than because we were waiting foreign [Music] these are things which are going to take us across the river we don't want to take them lightly you have shown us the way you have shown us the light we have shown us the seventh seal we have shown as the third pool all that is to make us to be sure that we are on the right path amen thank you Father that we are in this light yes a lot of people are now in the denominations they don't even know that the prophet is there they don't know that you have come to visit people they don't know that mexic is around they don't know that the third pool is working what they just know is maybe to speak in tongues oh Lord thank you for opening our eyes be with us now as we are waiting for that day only shall see your holy face Amen in Jesus last time I pray magnifying will find holy name amen amen foreign and God said let us make men in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the kettle and Over All the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth yes amen 27. so God created men in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them hallelujah amen so a man don't get tired of standing was greeted in the likeness of God hallelujah amen so when you see man you see who one among we see God when you see a man you see God hallelujah amen hallelujah amen because when you are walking the streets people come to you but walk away you are looking like you say yes don't say yes it was my father hey it's me again amen because when my grandfather was working trying to preserve himself as he was preserving himself he was preserving me as he was running away from a lion he was running away with me so that means this is not me I said now this is him standing here because without him please so let's see what the light came to tell somebody Genesis 3 verse 6. Tennessee chapter 3 verse 6. and when the woman saw that that she was with my brother uh maybe I have let's start from verse one all right yes now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field to which the Lord God had made yes and he said unto the woman yeah have God said he shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said he shall not eat of it neither shall he touch it lest he died and the shepherd said unto the woman he shall not surely die for God does know that in the day he eat day off then your eyes shall be open and he shall be as Gods knowing good and Ill listen to that tillage she's telling when you eat this tell me that if you eat this um you shall be like God because unlimited but God already made her to be a god so you find a lot of people trying to make people something which they already are or they are not um so he says to the woman Genesis 21 26 says they were made as God what in the image of God amen amen amen so now six and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes Okay uh what did the pastor kodima say about c what does c mean s understand that the tree was good which God said no the woman now has good understanding can you see the mistake here now I want a person how do you understand something don't do that and somebody comes to make you understand that that it was present to the eyes and was a tree to be desired to make one wise characteristically fish so she took the tree she took the fruit thereof and did it and gave also to her husband so uh the Bible is very good a billion years in a in a Bible um can build it in just one sentence in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth yes it just stands for billions of years to interpret that um uh if you want to uh if you want to hear that I'll take you back to the message the unveiling of God paragraph uh 1964 paragraph 22. more paragraph 22. hallelujah amen now my subject this morning I trust that God will review this and each time if you if you who take the tips and listen to and I hope trust that you have scripture spiritual understanding of what God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out foreign hallelujah amen he doesn't want all people to understand because these things are not for them that's a thing sometimes we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down now it might bring some to go out some to live some to Pond over but that's done in purposely after sales it must be done that way then it might be someone to say you mean God would purposely do a thing like that [Music] he certainly did he does yet speaking foreign was told who would eat there's a tree of life all these trees I mean that tree don't ever go into fellowship with a tree my brother my sister that tree was a person amen hallelujah amen this is just the introduction I'm not getting on my message for today where these things came from and then we go to to the to the message of the day what happened in the beginning the woman musadi wanted to have more Advantage she wanted to have her own uh freedom [Music] because God told her mama Mama Don't Preach the Devil Comes saying the woman understood yes we can preach you know with their equal rights she understood she saw a born and she went to tell her husband you know uh they are telling us a church now we can be preaching she wanted to have an advantage the devil wanted a woman to have some power they wanted what the woman uh wanted uh to have some power so when they had taken the fruit and uh this realized they were naked so they said Okay um become uh let's become Presbyterians Presbyterian so they said yeah yeah yeah it's very good let's take a uniform of Presbyterian for me I'm a presbyterian Hallelujah so uh Adam would be walking Adam with that those leaves you turn around you're looking good because as soon as God arrived my brother that's what happens to all wrong doctrines in their own Echo chamber who didn't know the only time in which you know whether you are right or wrong when God comes not when your pastor friend comes not when your or your your father-in-law who comes reasons my brother live any other life or which you want to live leave but there will be a day which you want God to come to heal you all religion which you have now can stand for you at that day because Tower when you really need God to come then everything needs to be all right and that is why I tell you my brother if you want to know a Ministry which God is there to look at the way they are preaching out the way they are putting the grammar together the power behind the ministry are they getting healed are they getting healed now if you go with your problem does it get solved by the Holy Spirit oh it just goes into pending oh wow the power behind the ministry look at the way we can lecture you on the way because that's what even uh Adam were doing lecturing one another you know you can see things you know the these brothers who are who can see things yes but there's is there power after seeing the things uh uh three three verse eight Genesis chapter 3 verse 8 Hallelujah now let's listen and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day what was the voice of God doing and they heard the voice of the Lord God working in the garden in the school The Voice had legs the voice of God has got what because it was where was it working no that's not for us the voice of God today should be walking in Imam a lot if you can see a young sister well dressed that is the voice of God walking killing children looking for the Lost Eve there might be a lost Eve in Social movie I would rather be like that one um the voice of God is still working today there is a voice working tonight the voice of God which came walking ninja we didn't hear or in the Bible that it went back because foreign starting from there we have uh finished Hallelujah now uh let me go to uh to the volume one my brother let me start from there I got to move volume one on one issue my brother so let's start all these things from the beginning amen yes so uh if we're going to go with the beginning at the beginning matoma according to Moses it was the creation you see there to Moses in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth that was the beginning according to Moses but if you can go for a deeper Revelation you find that when John comes in the beginning was the words in the beginning hallelujah amen so in the beginning for according to a deeper Revelation in the beginning was the word but when the seventh seal is opened when you hear from there no longer it was the word it was foreign if you are not in God's attributes then you cannot be here you cannot be in the message it has to be that God thought about you from the beginning amen amen so let me uh throw in an atomic bomb the end my fellow is Mount Sunset okay Mount sunset after that there's nothing once the seven seal comes there's nothing left people are still looking for things but once the seven seal came come on that is go and read the message is this the sign of the inside yeah is this the end sign of the answer Hallelujah there's nothing after that 28 February 1963. curriculum age of February 1963. okay now usually if you can look the uh if you are checking the Book of Genesis you'll find that God is taught Sarah that I will visit you according to the days of life amen they are children here so I don't want to talk about the days of Life sisters [Music] Hallelujah so according to the time of life 28. that's why when you go to heaven every 28 days the fruits will be coming out of the trees because it's a time of camera Hallelujah the moon goes round 28 days the time of Illinois hallelujah amen so now Charlie how do we come to understand all these Daniel Daniel which is our subject today wanted to understand these things but it was denied over him because the Seven Seals was that it opened brother my my brother my sister one day we are the most informed generation of all time I've never been another generation she was as informed as us because of the opening of the seventh seals amen um somebody can say eh all the time seven seal seven seven seals okay my brother one if if you're gonna buy a Mercedes and AMG Mercedes Mercedes AMG when you talk when you're drinking tea like this or not here what would be the next word we should say this Mercedes okay wait you see okay you will see when you have one of your most important things it doesn't come out of your mouth it doesn't every time even people say hey he's coming he's going to tell us about it be because that is where everything for you is we cannot speak without talking about the seven seal and the third pool Hallelujah now today don't worry uh I'm not going to finish anytime soon we should start the subject now amen So today we're starting on the uh Daniel chapter 1 verse 3. don't forget what I've said because it would be important at the end amen it would be very important at the end because everything starts in the Book of Genesis in Revelation this is there my brother yes verse 3. yes and the King speak unto us the master of his units yes that he shall bring certain of the children of Israel and of the king's sea and of the princes children in whom was not blemish but well favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science and such as her ability in them to stand in the king's place palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the children's hallelujah amen this is in Babylon hallelujah amen in Babylon this is not the first Babylon which you're talking about as a member the first Babylon babelama Tom is the one which Nimrod built Nimrod was very clever even though until the Bible says people they started becoming Mighty afternoon minimum Lord he was a conqueror but Nimrod had something which is very sad his own mother was his wife no wonder I find there's a church which is the mother the wife of the same yeah there's a church which the mother is a wife as well until the Muslims they become confused so you say which is which is Jesus mother or is this the wife but that is all about Nimrod nimrod is the one who instituted all Adventures of trying to go to heaven without repentance he told the people and we talk about one gentlemen no need for alter God come and join us building this uh Church to Heaven as long as we've got a big church so they kept in building God said they're going to our lives so if you see somebody want to build a church without repentance [Applause] [Music] you find all these uh I'm not mentioned names because of the uh they can they can arrest me but they are all over you see that they don't even mention repentance at all mention about cleaning up at all what that measure is foreign let's work together to build up this thing when you come there they don't ask you to repent around until you can steal money from the government and give it to them to build the Tower Hallelujah so you can see here one or more it says his King Hoshi was very clever King he said to the to the eunuch I want those brothers who are doing well among these people I wonder about those just make sure that those those princes of these people I wonder because he doesn't want to use others because he wants the princess people which people can understand without blemish those who are skillful when the devil wants to work in the church he will look for the princess Nebuchadnezzar is it there foreign [Music] my friend and I were were they experiment the experiment to make sure that the UCT becomes black new city was all white when we joined it so when we were there hey they were treating us very badly but uh we survived I was in the neck blocks in the day yeah they were speaking hey somebody said my brother this is nothing just go to store and watch my brother hey um they want you to learn their language but they don't want to learn your language so the first thing which is that somebody does to defeat you oh fenya is to remove your language Hallelujah my language is changed for you to do the language has changed again you have to say I know brother we are the same you know all churches are the same we are brothers in Christ who told you we are brothers in class or not our language is one you are the sons of the devil we are the sons of God don't change the language change the language it's the trick of the devil all these United Nations Human Rights was United Nations our language is a woman must not preach language we are not going to speak their language so he wanted to speak them to be speaking to be speaking their language Hallelujah so let's go we see the King was very very clever what he was doing horses and the King and the King appointed them a daily provision of the king Smith just imagine and of the wine which he drank just imagine so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king speaking our language the meat is there for you and you know Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar is the Golden Age of a gentile disposition email today can't eat as good food as the name was eating the president America disposal don't give them those uh quotas no no don't give an importance these ones give them in the meat which I eat myself my brother one is what privilege this gentleman had how many of you would still speak this language if they meet him how many of you would start speaking the language yes how many were we that time do you remember there were so many brothers all of them when they meet him a message my young brother who is going to University now University remember you're going to eat the king's meat today don't forget our language we were many brothers in this message but as soon as the rain started going to the pocket people forgot the language they started eating the king's meat they started taking the wine of the kief but if you go to verse 8 more of S8 it says eerie but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with a portion of the king's meat Dan Daniel therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself amen amen the book is here which I'm preaching from the beginning and the ending of the gentle dispensations he had purposed in his Arts when he went down to Babylon will Araya Babylon that he was not going he was going to remain a believer how men are going to University of Pretoria here when you have been The Crucible of the devil called the University of Johannesburg I will still remain a Believer I will still remain a believer that is a Daniel of today foreign the first time you just got to get the GTI you start becoming your language changes oh great GTA available oh brother I was busy oh brother So Daniel Daniel was in captivity brother one is don't forget we are in captivity today this is not our home every opportunity which comes to us can you just imagine that day when the names came out Edgar go to the university of salsa University we'll tell everybody you know in university university but the devil behind says you should make a purpose yes I am in captivity and an opportunity of reason when I'm in captivity I still remember Zion we got a place amen we've got a place we got a position in Christ which we need to maintain regardless of whatever is amen amen you know success is sickness you know [Music] at the hospital when you are very very sick when you are very sick you don't mind the way you are dressed even if your father-in-law or mother-in-law was there you don't mind about the way you are dressed you are very sick so if you are very very sick that you are sick now how are you now the way you answer the daughter will know whether you are right or not because instead of answering I am fine because you are sick go and see check with the brothers who have left to come into church ask them how are you brother literally they will shock which is foreign say yeah I know I don't know the doctor write down he does not where he is what time is it now he will not even know what time it is amen so they will write in the book this is oriented in place persons and time and space foreign [Music] is disoriented he has forgotten where he is Hallelujah so we have to purpose in our hearts Branham says Daniel did it without the holy ghosts we just remembering Zion but he was purposely in his heart regardless of whatever position I'll be here amen my pastor will be my pastor my dick will be my dick because that's what he came from he never wanted to go that's where we came from what we wear in his attributes that's what we want to remains has given us hallelujah amen hallelujah amen [Music] one time at home there about about 10 years ago so I saw a lot of prisoners are learning they were running foreign away so we are trying to go and catch them he had been in prison so good it was so comfortable in prisoners he's been well fed in prison where he's so comfortable that you want everybody to remain in prison hallelujah amen Daniel Daniel remained a Believer made so today I want to give you an interpretation of a Believer according to the children's what can happen so the king had a dream so when that dream got gone away from him he couldn't remember so it was the uh The Magicians the dream The Magicians couldn't tell him the interpretation then he told them I'm going to kill all of you I'm going to kill all the wise men All The Magicians you are useless you are supposed to tell me the dreams they came and maybe in a political way to tell the king I know there's no such a king which is asking his people to do this let's go to chapter 2 verse 10. the chaudians answered before the king and said there is not a man upon Earth that can show The King's mother therefore there is no King no Lord no ruler that has such things of any magician astrologer or chardian um 11. it is a layer thing that the king requires there is none other that can show it before thee except the goods who's dwelling is nothing fresh horses so the careers were saying if somebody does this that is a God you accept people who are becoming devils [Music] amen so the Dream came can have volume three please and here's the interpretation thereof if that's the dream the King was thinking well on his bed when he was sleeping at night what will become of my kingdom I am a very powerful but what will become of the Kingdom God spoke to nebuchadnezzarella of which is the interpretation he didn't know but when Daniel came to him he told him your kingdom will change it to the patients who come to the Greeks after the Greeks who come to the Romans after the Romans they need to be very very mixed they'll be Republic of South Africa and the Republic of Tanzania a Republican union African Union Asia Pacific Union Asia Pacific Union but remember Daniel didn't tell Nebuchadnezzar Daniela said but your kingdom is going to finish the man who has ever come on Earth and represented God is foreign so even if you are reading this you're listening all of you are listening to Moses All of You are listening to Moses Moses speaking they needed someone come and tell them he was speaking Hebrew um was interpreting Hebrew to the Hebrews ourselves so he was telling them when he said uh that means he said God has created so what what was required since I was going to find Moses who understands Moses [Music] the word of God is Not of private interpretation now you have to find the Moses but when you find Moses you have to find an arrowhead is a priesthood prista hallelujah amen so a man who can tell you your dream and the interpretation that one is the god hallelujah amen the same picture my brother one issue a picture nailer so you can see there is a man is a stamina so if God is a stamina you can see there's a money but when God comes to interpret this on Daniel 7. you will find that beasts of play uh the head was a lion the best was a leopard they are animals because animals can follow stand for power I'm going to lead amen so Alexander the Great was an animal Alexander the greatest were animals so that thing becomes animals hallelujah amen you see God don't try to be uh speaking for God because they're going to confuse people because you find people are busy in the church this is not what God was what was trying to say here because this was foreign that is where my brother my sister you can't just start a Ministry from nowhere God has to send you somewhere oh God hallelujah amen God is a stamina you can speak a little here amen amen me was the one that the seventh seal now gonna see things so what let's see Harmony how will are we going to know that this animal is this God did show us right away here right away here Daniel was shot Daniela won chitra 725 verse 25 how would you know that this is is that animal now so 5 7 25. what how will we know that this is the animal and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the Saints of the most high and think to change times and laws and they shall be given unto his hand until a time and times are divided and the dividing of time hallelujah amen which animal on Earth people have changed our times which calendar are we using please which laws are we using it and actually I can tell you this the first Caesar Augustus his mother was Julia Julian so that's why there's a mass to his mother him Augustus in Augustus was an Octavian evenly Octavia that's why there is October for himself Changing Times 365 days or a Roman calendar calendar the best of the sun is on 21 to 21st December um that's the day which is the the sun is returning back from the Tropic of Capricorn going back to to Europe so he was able to change the laws and the times leading now and nobody can do that anymore now we have seen what this Beast is is which is being talked about here says because it is a beast which was able to change [Music] version 13. and I stood upon the sand of the sea and so a beast rise up out of the sea yes having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his head the name of blasphemy yes and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard yes and his Speedway as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority hallelujah amen Daniel Daniel because God told him you cannot understand all this go and sleep it will be interpreted later on now we find that uh that same Beast has become one yeah according to the United Nations see we try United Nations they give me the uh the volume for the United Nations we don't know where the heads who is the head of the United Nations this power Mata has become mixed now is a power yeah hallelujah amen hallelujah amen amen let's see uh how we can identify this power now we're going to identify it don't worry let's go to 13 verse 13. Ariana yes and he dwell he doeth great wonders so that he may have fire come down from heaven on the earth in the side of me foreign foreign so the power is coming together but remember the devil had a purpose from the beginning amen so if you go to 14 or 14 says what 14 he deceives Men by voice Twitter uh or foreign by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the side of the peace saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and deadly amen so he diseases by miracles for a commission I'm telling you there are so many miracles happening right now which you don't understand [Music] you work in finance your money transfer not quite he works in finance but doesn't understand because the way they have made International money transfer is so clever that it's only America if you don't have a corresponding Bank in America for money around the world the way they have made the internet it's all so clever yeah Miracles being done inside of me inside of men but it's all to deceive people but that is what God has given us to identify who is the Beast because from the beginning the devil had a desire Hallelujah hallelujah amen he wanted to give if power obvious hallelujah amen hallelujah amen what why did he mix up all these powers let's go to Revelation 17 verse 1. Hallelujah and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show and today the Judgment of the Great War that seated upon many Waters stop there my brother amen amen which Angel is this which which Angel did show us all of you are Bible Believers one of the Seven Angels which came to show us the seventh angel who is none other than William Marion Branham hallelujah amen reporting me to so many people and that came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show answers stop there I'm aware not Jesus Jeffersonville he would have said come to Jeffersonville Indiana Hallelujah Hallelujah where should we come told us there was a time there was a vision of uh junior Jackson sword he took a sword and opened the top of a mountain it was white inside there and uh there was nothing issue then I have volume Five can you see the stone that's the stone okay which program has opened for us alone hallelujah amen where's brother Branham where yes they were saying the right thing is does he call you to go now when he says he wants you to go in there oh [Music] where should we go because he didn't want us to go to Jerusalem because Jerusalem is of the devil Jerusalem Johannesburg is of the devil Johannesburg New York is of the devil according to the Bible Malawi is of the devil so he wanted us to go away when we can go up there where brother Branham is what what do you call when there's a lot of people what do you call it in English as a grandma waiting for that I mean so now usually here's a thing which is the interpretation is somebody looked and saw nothing um they went away it's a granite it's a guy amen it's a granite yeah okay Granite but I aim to saw my face [Music] that's why I'm still here how many are tired of local seeing their face in the mirror here when when I saw my face in the mirror um I saw my face in the mirror I saw a very beautiful boy in the middle there yeah until my sister came to interpret says no you're not that beautiful you are very ugly but me I saw that I was moves those of us who have seen our faces inside there we are not going to get out of seeing this thing is cloudy because I have seen my face I'll tell others that is that easy that is me okay now I am in there amen brother I love to see yourself you are there it's looking like a crowd because it's very far but when you come very closely you find that you can see yourself there hey so brother is calling us leave whatever you have come up hallelujah amen the devil has maturity so let's see what what was the aim of the devil from the beginning you remember what we said about the devil yeah you remember the first verse which is the tree in chapter three the devil was giving power to a wife a woman let's see in the end because this is the end now that was in the beginning let's go on Rachel MP I'll show you the whole that seated upon many Waters yes yes with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the F have been made to run with the wine of her foreign ERS yes and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet can you say I saw if sitting yes the evil today and I saw a woman if sit upon a Scarlet colored piece full of names of blasphemy stop there have you how many have read the the book was

Genesis 1 26 is happening right now in here kamu people who started becoming like him about to battle Thomas because that was the aim even in my chemistry the aim of the devil my chemistry was for if to have power even today is sitting on the beach I don't have the picture of Eve sitting on it but uh you should know that's what the Bible is saying that on top of this Beast now there is a woman so there's America in there there's Russia whatsoever power England is in there they will tell you whipping your child is sin but marrying him a man marrying a man is all right power of a peace the seventh seal is opened the white stone is clearly there's a writing inside there but the writing is those of you who not see yourself inside the pyramid today my brother you'll be in trouble you will

God has always had a witness somewhere [Music] somewhere amen he never leaves himself without a witness no matter what sometimes it just gets to one now see it amen sometimes I can only be one now but

hidden place there's a precious hiding places foreign the whole world now is naked the only person who is dressed up with the bride now if you go to Dubai now you find more undressed people that are

expand for mommy to uh Cape Town Cape Town Restaurant is expanding and it's filling the whole world until the enemies go nowhere to hide that's the stone which has come kill it secretly to take down the image of the devil down barbell is in danger Babylon Equity because the estonians come the Revelation has come to lately and each and every one of us says the importance of a revelation cannot be over emphasized every one of us have to have their own peace of Heaven foreign K2 H2O yeah H2O isn't it okay H2O all right I mean okay what about this glass is containing What last year the h2oj can take out face in guy you take many of them whole church can do a bigger job isn't it because when the H2O comes together the H2O coupon then they are used becomes better but the chemical formula is the same yeah myself on your own ownership you can't even quench first let's come together because when we are together there's a God in you god in me when we come together we can do a bigger job so when we come there where when the water from swazilands they make this zombies when they come to cupboards come together but if you go alone we all know you are H2O or h2o you are going alone we all knows go and sit on on the sunflowers you immediately you've never seen this is fight all the goodness vaporized immediately but when you come together with us we move together recipes and we Rin have made it deliberately that we will not be part of the cosmos of this world we have a bigger thing which has been shown to us the revealed words amen what was the word of God doing in the Garden of Eden walking will it be it was working Elizabeth I mean the word of God isn't it now what is the word of God doing in the Book of Revelation what's the word of God doing in the Revelation the word of God is riding a horse in Revelations they're aware of what is not a book as a book the word of God is a person moved to so who is the word of God as we are becoming what is written in there you remember when they're teaching you uh economics economics what do you become what do you become an economist Economist yes if you are teaching me the way what do we come amen amen amen but you have to go to the school we have the teaching the way yeah because sometimes people can tell you they are teaching you economics economics people can tell you I know I'll teach you how to fly a plane but you'll find the plane is made of leaves the Revelation has to be where you have to find the correct teacher so if you are teaching me economics what do you become economists at the end I become wise amen so it will be the word of God walking [Music] amen remember to you you become the word walking in the light him is the light and you become the light amen walking the light him is alive and you become the Lord you become what you each offered to ourselves amen um sorry I don't want to give you another example because people can become angry amen if you come to Malawi come along and ask my brother who is my son that what is the name of the pastor in the another church he just saying there he'll tell you I don't know but people are busy in their houses and people telling their children the problems of other pastors what do you want them to become haters because if you teach somebody Witchcraft and you want him to become an economist is it um if you want somebody to become to be a mathematician you teach the mathematics you tell them f x is equal to or f80 minus W squared times y squared divided by Z squared they will become mathematicians foreign so it is you who will be hallelujah hallelujah if you want to know where the word of God is you know in Malawi most of the ganja which you smoke here comes from my life there's a person so people smoke so much but why how do they sell themselves I am Pilots yet there is surprises but he's giving me a plane move Festival flight or is a human flight against everybody calls him a Bible age there's a problem come which needs a pastor let the problem come which means the pastor in fact the pastor says because there's no power in him the word of God has got what the same way which Walked In the Garden of Eden on a horse behind that um I don't want to talk about testimonies but uh my brother something happens because the word of God now is sliding on a horse the woman is riding on what is a beast can you describe that Beast it's just a mixture of things Democratic power demonic power money [Music] you can see it's just a mixture that's the power of the enemy the power of God who have power over the power of our Devils you remember the role of alone are the Mastery over all other Roots those people those roads had been their houses for too long they stay in the house for too long they say oh no no the Lord of godima has swallowed our roads they were disarmed by clearly covered unfortunately some of them it was a walking stick I don't know how they walked home they were completely disarmed by children by the power in The Lord of Alone by Taylor Martin was the lord of the Lord so the power of God is good is healing position is a bit is to tell people where the power of God is the main things the main thing is that's why we are here so tomorrow we'll hear the words don't run away because if we teach you economics what economics what do you become an economist if I teach him mathematics what do you become teacher mathematics mathematician you know in mathematics car met they are very difficult things to do it if in mathematics you come to divide by zero whatever divided how many you are teachers there if you divide by zero in mathematics they will say you are such a deadly sinner in mathematics mathematics because if you're not careful we are going to start dividing by zero you have to be taught very well that the power of FX can only come from -3 to plus three don't go outside there it's not our power of your area amen zero and then there will be a problem you need to operate the way evil is taught operate within this area this is your area but if wanted something bigger to make an advantage to herself or write the real advantage and here we are in trouble people looking for their own advantages the scene of if the sin of the World Series when they have sought their own salvation without asking God first the doctrine of nimrod hello they want to go to heaven without to repentance we are going through the way of the Cross and it's not easy my brother my sister in case there's anybody here who doesn't have problems God bless you so much but all of us are fighting and who win that battle it will have faith unto him by the word of God which is taught by in on this puppets praise the Lord and I'll save no falling away [Music] your spirit without me is foreign [Music]
