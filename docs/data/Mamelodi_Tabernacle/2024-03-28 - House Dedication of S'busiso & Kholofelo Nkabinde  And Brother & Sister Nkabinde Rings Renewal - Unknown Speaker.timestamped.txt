[1:06:18] us you are here before the foundation of
[1:06:21] the world you saw this
[1:06:24] place yes
[1:06:26] you knew about
[1:06:29] this predestinated
[1:06:33] it and the father you planed the
[1:06:37] whole
[1:06:39] events to take place in this
[1:06:43] house for we believe that before there
[1:06:47] was
[1:06:49] anything you were
[1:06:51] there that's why the Bible says we were
[1:06:55] chosen CH in
[1:06:57] you we were chosen in you not in any
[1:07:01] church but in
[1:07:04] you before the foundation of the
[1:07:08] world father we are your thoughts made
[1:07:13] manifest we are the manifested thoughts
[1:07:16] of the almighty God that's
[1:07:20] why Satan has got no
[1:07:24] rights and Satan has got no power over
[1:07:29] us that's why even those that are
[1:07:33] sick will will be healed just
[1:07:37] now because that was the power of God
[1:07:41] that by his stripes we were
[1:07:44] healed father we thank you we are in
[1:07:48] this
[1:07:50] house but this house
[1:07:53] father was molded by
[1:07:57] amen but he who molded all things is
[1:08:01] God even our
[1:08:04] bodies are
[1:08:05] buildings molded by day but it depends
[1:08:09] who dwells in that bu in this
[1:08:13] building so thank you Lord as we open
[1:08:16] the
[1:08:17] scriptures speak to
[1:08:19] us for the
[1:08:22] moment of
[1:08:24] blessings that the father you have
[1:08:27] called us to this place bless this m

[1:08:46] John 15 ver
[1:08:49] 5 I am the vine you are the
[1:08:53] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:08:58] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:09:02] for without me you can do
[1:09:08] nothing Hebrews chapter
[1:09:12] 3 verse 1 to
[1:09:15] 4 wherefore holy
[1:09:18] Brethren partakers of the Heavenly
[1:09:21] calling consider the Apostle and the
[1:09:24] high priest of our profession Christ
[1:09:29] Jesus who was faithful to him that
[1:09:32] appointed him as also Moses was faithful
[1:09:37] in all his house for this man was
[1:09:40] counted worthy of more Glory than
[1:09:44] Moses in as much as he who have build
[1:09:48] the house as more honor than the house
[1:09:52] for every house is builded by some men
[1:09:56] but he that build all things is
[1:09:59] God Amen you may be seated
[1:10:09] bless let's take that first
[1:10:14] scripture say
[1:10:18] it just say
[1:10:24] it
[1:10:26] I
[1:10:29] am I am the vine you are the
[1:10:33] branches he that apped in me and I in
[1:10:37] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:10:41] for without me you can do nothing
[1:10:45] amen without me you can
[1:10:50] do nothing means
[1:10:54] nothing amen
[1:10:57] amen I can
[1:11:00] build a house bigger than this
[1:11:03] one but if it is without
[1:11:10] him because he is the
[1:11:15] creator maybe you have
[1:11:18] this I can build a house bigger than
[1:11:21] this
[1:11:23] one and put expens
[1:11:30] without I
[1:11:36] have in the
[1:11:39] beginning
[1:11:41] was and God created all
[1:11:47] things that's why
[1:11:50] we we came from the mind of
[1:11:54] God am he's a
[1:11:57] mighty
[1:12:00] Builder know this body of
[1:12:04] mind
[1:12:07] buing is a
[1:12:10] building then he said again I'm going to
[1:12:14] prepare for you a
[1:12:17] place so that where I am you to should
[1:12:23] be all right
[1:12:25] every day as we were
[1:12:28] coming I saw some new houses down
[1:12:33] there but yet I I've got the
[1:12:37] scripture I'm still
[1:12:40] waiting for the
[1:12:42] place
[1:12:44] amen whose maker and Builder is
[1:12:50] God all what I've
[1:12:53] seen shall pass
[1:12:57] I know very
[1:12:59] well everything that you look
[1:13:02] at as long as it is a
[1:13:06] creation it will pass
[1:13:09] away we read to
[1:13:13] you where it
[1:13:15] says everything that was
[1:13:24] created
[1:13:25] why it can be confusing to
[1:13:30] somebody there's what we call
[1:13:35] creation but you were not
[1:13:39] created your body was
[1:13:43] created hallu amen amen so the real real
[1:13:49] man is the one that was not
[1:13:52] created because this one
[1:13:55] is
[1:13:57] temporary in this
[1:13:59] one God has put a
[1:14:07] theop
[1:14:11] never amen shall never go to
[1:14:17] hospital he
[1:14:20] is forever and ever and
[1:14:24] ever
[1:14:25] forever is not even
[1:14:32] enough because talking about
[1:14:36] forever talking about the space of
[1:14:40] time
[1:14:42] the of the that is
[1:14:46] in
[1:14:49] is
[1:14:51] etal is not forever he is etal
[1:14:58] that's why we have read
[1:15:01] that everything that was
[1:15:05] created shall come to
[1:15:09] pass
[1:15:11] because you you were not
[1:15:16] created God it says God
[1:15:22] created all right amen but you know
[1:15:27] before there was any
[1:15:30] creation you were
[1:15:33] there waiting
[1:15:42] foration just get that Ephesians chapter
[1:15:47] 4 ver again verse 30
[1:15:54] okay
[1:16:00] somebody can read
[1:16:02] it and grief not the holy spirit of God
[1:16:06] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[1:16:11] redemption right stop there a
[1:16:14] bit when is the day of
[1:16:21] redemption okay you fear to say when is
[1:16:25] the day of
[1:16:28] redemption to redeem is to take
[1:16:30] something back to his
[1:16:38] original now the day of
[1:16:41] redemption is the
[1:16:44] day as I have read what the prophet has
[1:16:49] said says the day of
[1:16:52] redemption is the day the book of
[1:16:55] redemption was
[1:16:59] opened it's called the day of
[1:17:04] redemption that's why the one that sat
[1:17:08] on the
[1:17:10] throne and had a book in his right
[1:17:14] hand your name was in that
[1:17:18] book
[1:17:20] amen uh all the redeemed the chosen of
[1:17:24] God
[1:17:27] their
[1:17:30] names it was so
[1:17:32] special that it was in the
[1:17:35] hand of the one that on
[1:17:39] the until the
[1:17:42] time when the book was
[1:17:46] opened amen am and when it was
[1:17:50] opened it was opened for me and
[1:17:53] you to be able to
[1:17:57] see
[1:18:00] ourselves in the
[1:18:03] book this
[1:18:05] book um the other part of the
[1:18:10] book what what is it
[1:18:14] called there's
[1:18:17] two parts of the
[1:18:23] book one
[1:18:26] part was sealed with Seven
[1:18:30] Seals sealed with Seven
[1:18:34] Seals on
[1:18:38] the on
[1:18:40] the it was
[1:18:43] with that's why
[1:18:45] now that's now the ministry we
[1:18:50] have
[1:18:52] the min
[1:18:56] all right now I read this because I just
[1:19:00] want to
[1:19:02] close now it
[1:19:05] says without
[1:19:09] me that's why I believe this word of God
[1:19:14] because I know
[1:19:17] myself I know that without
[1:19:20] him I can do
[1:19:23] nothing
[1:19:26] yes I believe
[1:19:28] that because I have realized that
[1:19:33] without
[1:19:34] him there's nothing that I can do or can
[1:19:38] you do something
[1:19:43] without
[1:19:44] amen he the doer of all
[1:19:48] things now that's why everything in the
[1:19:53] temp in the
[1:19:57] Bible the
[1:20:02] buildings were
[1:20:05] dedicated the temp
[1:20:09] wased and whatever was put in that
[1:20:11] Temple was
[1:20:16] also am so that's why every child of
[1:20:22] God after building
[1:20:31] because is not dedicated is
[1:20:37] vulnerable Satan can
[1:20:41] crush it is not dedicated to the
[1:20:46] Lord right that's why we read in the
[1:20:49] Bible we realized that all things were
[1:20:53] dedicated
[1:20:55] if it is
[1:20:57] notated not end of
[1:21:02] the it is
[1:21:05] yours and if it is yours Satan can
[1:21:09] destroy
[1:21:10] it but if it is
[1:21:13] God Satan
[1:21:18] no you know I'm talking like
[1:21:20] this I think this will make you
[1:21:23] wonder
[1:21:25] I believe that you have heard
[1:21:28] me when I
[1:21:30] said I'm going around
[1:21:36] dedicated but I don't remember my
[1:21:50] house did I dedicate my
[1:21:53] house
[1:21:56] where is do
[1:22:01] do is she
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:05] here in the
[1:22:07] house okay I
[1:22:11] think she dedicating in
[1:22:17] the
[1:22:18] okay now let's do this before we pray we
[1:22:23] call
[1:22:27] now I told some
[1:22:30] brothers I'm preparing for a
[1:22:34] day
[1:22:37] foration of
[1:22:40] everything in
[1:22:42] my
[1:22:44] my in my
[1:22:47] house but every day before I can
[1:22:52] sleep I dedicate
[1:22:57] sorry I can't call you at that
[1:22:59] time that's in the middle of the
[1:23:03] night and sometimes usually I
[1:23:09] sleep all right now every
[1:23:15] night I
[1:23:18] dedicate my house
[1:23:22] my the BL of Christ
[1:23:30] I dedicate because I know that without
[1:23:35] him without
[1:23:38] Jesus I'm
[1:23:43] nothing amen you should know that in
[1:23:46] your
[1:23:47] life can have
[1:23:50] money
[1:23:53] nothing nothing at
[1:23:56] all
[1:23:58] without that's why he says without
[1:24:03] me take it on without
[1:24:09] me so everything that you you think you
[1:24:12] are
[1:24:15] doing says is
[1:24:21] nothing
[1:24:23] everything that he did not
[1:24:27] create to him
[1:24:30] is amen a house is a
[1:24:34] house if it is after it is dedicated to
[1:24:39] him it
[1:24:47] is because without him there's
[1:24:52] nothing you got nothing you can have
[1:24:59] billions money
[1:25:07] lovers
[1:25:11] are all
[1:25:13] right let me read
[1:25:17] here I was with a
[1:25:20] brother he's not here
[1:25:22] today we were walking
[1:25:25] a
[1:25:26] certain now here comes a
[1:25:30] man and I could see just by looking at
[1:25:35] him because he said to
[1:25:38] us he came
[1:25:40] through
[1:25:42] the he came through the
[1:25:45] people to
[1:25:47] us and
[1:25:49] said I have left my children
[1:25:54] my wife without
[1:25:58] food
[1:26:00] amen and I was with
[1:26:07] brother he has left
[1:26:11] children all right now you
[1:26:16] say what if he is just a
[1:26:21] cook when I look at him not a
[1:26:26] cre I told you one day
[1:26:29] that we
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:34] were
[1:26:39] with can I repeat
[1:26:42] it as we were
[1:26:45] standing at the mall there were so many
[1:26:48] people
[1:26:50] there but God Made Me to look at a
[1:26:55] certain
[1:26:57] woman she was going around
[1:27:00] there a child her
[1:27:05] hand and she just looked at
[1:27:08] us we were some
[1:27:15] away but she looked
[1:27:18] around and she looked straight at
[1:27:22] us and she she was among the
[1:27:25] people but I could
[1:27:28] see was looking at
[1:27:31] us while wondering why that
[1:27:36] woman she's looking at
[1:27:39] us then she
[1:27:42] came with this child in the hand
[1:27:45] straight to
[1:27:47] us going through the
[1:27:50] people and stood right before us
[1:27:54] and they said me and my
[1:28:02] child can I say we are
[1:28:08] hungry
[1:28:11] and the man I was
[1:28:14] with she said there something in their
[1:28:17] language I couldn't
[1:28:21] understand but you just say
[1:28:27] then I took money out of my
[1:28:41] pocket so
[1:28:43] I what what do you what do you think she
[1:28:47] can do for herself and the
[1:28:53] child
[1:28:59] make sure that it should shoot up
[1:29:06] to searching and you realize that you
[1:29:17] don't then it makes you
[1:29:23] li it makes
[1:29:26] you right and
[1:29:28] then I said
[1:29:32] pastor this woman was standing
[1:29:35] there
[1:29:37] child then suddenly
[1:29:43] she
[1:29:48] are then she
[1:29:51] came just like that woman oh man
[1:29:57] she came from behind because there was a
[1:30:03] pool when Jesus was there you know if
[1:30:06] you are a child of
[1:30:09] God you are a
[1:30:16] PO
[1:30:18] amen so I told the men of
[1:30:23] God
[1:30:24] I said she came I was watching she came
[1:30:27] straight to us passing
[1:30:31] through has
[1:30:34] seen she has seen
[1:30:38] somebody you know
[1:30:41] [Music]
[1:30:44] today people and all that you know what
[1:30:47] Isen in
[1:30:50] the but the
[1:30:53] here uh they saw only one
[1:30:59] man the Lord Jesus
[1:31:03] Christ amen but there so many around
[1:31:09] here sakes and all that
[1:31:14] but after building before they started
[1:31:19] building there was something in
[1:31:22] them building a house for the
[1:31:28] Lord a delling
[1:31:31] place all right as I told you about that
[1:31:36] woman
[1:31:39] Dre she said she
[1:31:44] dreed
[1:31:46] Satan mes them in the
[1:31:49] house every
[1:31:51] night sleep
[1:31:55] then what did she do I told
[1:32:00] you because every night they couldn't
[1:32:04] sleep people cannot sleep many people
[1:32:08] can't
[1:32:10] sleep every night we have met
[1:32:15] them even last
[1:32:17] Sunday that Sunday even that Sunday they
[1:32:21] come say we can't sleep
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:26] there's this and this and this on the
[1:32:30] roof sister came and
[1:32:32] said every time I jump into my
[1:32:37] bed then there
[1:32:41] that
[1:32:46] understand then I hear that there's
[1:32:48] somebody now in
[1:32:52] the I am now I told
[1:32:57] you that I want you to
[1:33:12] put amen you must put something of
[1:33:17] God and many of you know what was
[1:33:22] that and she
[1:33:36] did that's why the song
[1:33:39] says I'm not
[1:33:42] alone only if you can know that you are
[1:33:46] not
[1:33:47] alone there is
[1:33:50] somebody we go to we used to go to some
[1:33:55] and some
[1:33:56] things that's when we were
[1:34:01] Al the said I shall be with
[1:34:10] you the end of the
[1:34:13] world so we are
[1:34:18] not even when you are
[1:34:21] threatened you are not
[1:34:25] when you are sick you are
[1:34:32] not the brothers were
[1:34:36] there I think is it last
[1:34:43] week or a week before last
[1:34:47] week here come couple with a
[1:34:52] girl
[1:34:56] and the Hand of the this
[1:34:58] girl was sticking right down like
[1:35:09] this now they
[1:35:12] said this has just happened to our
[1:35:18] daughter and I
[1:35:22] said then I I said to the
[1:35:25] girl just greet
[1:35:29] me then she
[1:35:34] stretched and I said do
[1:35:36] this she did that were
[1:35:41] you was there there yeah he was
[1:35:45] there then she could raise the
[1:35:51] hand now that was not
[1:35:55] uh
[1:35:56] uh the first
[1:36:00] thing that we have
[1:36:05] SE all
[1:36:07] right after that she took a paper and
[1:36:12] wrote on a paper toate to us that now
[1:36:17] she can
[1:36:22] write because the thing when I was told
[1:36:25] that this
[1:36:27] child just
[1:36:30] happened the first thing I knew
[1:36:34] that she's not
[1:36:37] alone I am not
[1:36:42] alone then we greet one
[1:36:45] another
[1:36:50] without because we have the third po
[1:36:57] what happened last
[1:36:59] week last
[1:37:01] Sunday because there's so many
[1:37:06] testimonies only
[1:37:12] are they are just bound with with the SE
[1:37:16] and the Bible
[1:37:22] says
[1:37:24] ton do
[1:37:29] what5 amen
[1:37:31] but seems as if the
[1:37:35] people don't
[1:37:38] see you must preach the whole word of
[1:37:44] God what have you seen last
[1:37:52] week that woman came
[1:37:58] oh okay there was a woman that came she
[1:38:01] had a
[1:38:02] stick and then her legs were she was
[1:38:07] having pain with her legs so when he
[1:38:09] arrived the pastor the pastor asked the
[1:38:13] questions
[1:38:15] and the sister answered then Pastor
[1:38:19] started to to lay hands upon her on
[1:38:22] those legs
[1:38:24] that sister was not she was so surprised
[1:38:27] because just out of that the pastor
[1:38:30] asked where's the pain the pain was no
[1:38:32] more and in she was walking all around
[1:38:34] from the office going up and down and he
[1:38:36] was so happy that the pen is
[1:38:40] gone and we got a video for that woman
[1:38:43] for that sister with us
[1:38:50] amen she was working on
[1:38:55] whated
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:00] after all right
[1:39:04] because she is
[1:39:06] not
[1:39:08] alone she didn't know that
[1:39:12] not
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:17] is the owners of this
[1:39:22] house they knew
[1:39:24] that without him without God they are
[1:39:32] vulnerable that's why they call the
[1:39:35] children of
[1:39:36] God in their house for a
[1:39:42] dedication so I believe
[1:39:45] that they have put him in their
[1:39:49] house him in their
[1:39:52] house just as I say that
[1:39:55] woman says she she she's a a
[1:40:04] Pentecost she
[1:40:07] went after they
[1:40:16] had they just use one word they
[1:40:20] say in the house
[1:40:24] and then
[1:40:26] uh what
[1:40:28] happened in her
[1:40:30] [Music]
[1:40:32] dream in Her Dream she
[1:40:35] saw the Lord Jesus Come into her
[1:40:40] house now she said to the
[1:40:44] Lord
[1:40:45] Lord I will put
[1:40:52] you
[1:40:54] I'll rent you that then after that the
[1:40:58] very same
[1:40:59] night
[1:41:04] Satan
[1:41:06] amen then the woman
[1:41:09] wondered
[1:41:12] because they had Jesus in the
[1:41:17] house now the next
[1:41:19] day they say she approached the Lord
[1:41:22] Jesus
[1:41:31] we have rented
[1:41:34] you the devil attacked us
[1:41:39] again in the house we were going up and
[1:41:43] down if but that house is
[1:41:47] quiet then the Lord said I've done what
[1:41:52] you have of
[1:41:53] [Music]
[1:41:56] I use that
[1:42:03] room then that said all right Lord now

[1:42:28] house that
[1:42:31] day their house was
[1:42:36] peaceful

[1:42:44] him but you can do that
[1:42:52] only
[1:42:54] that you have received from
[1:43:00] him because sometimes if a person has

[1:44:47] house the house of
[1:44:50] Christian is the house of all
[1:44:57] every person is
[1:45:00] welcome if it is a dedicated House of
[1:45:04] God there are some
[1:45:08] houses where there's a selection
[1:45:12] of some people don't come to that
[1:45:16] house only few
[1:45:18] people but the house of a child of God
[1:45:23] is the house of
[1:45:27] everybody you know
[1:45:29] that we know of houses
[1:45:32] where some people are welcome some are
[1:45:35] not

[1:45:41] that particular
[1:45:43] person but the house of God is the house
[1:45:48] for all the
[1:45:52] people
[1:45:56] all right so that's far now the last
[1:45:59] scripture
[1:46:03] here
[1:46:05] that
[1:46:06] Hebrews you know I love that
[1:46:10] scripture I love this
[1:46:12] one without
[1:46:18] me God
[1:46:20] says God says without
[1:46:24] there's nothing we can
[1:46:30] do I know of
[1:46:32] myself that without you let me tell you
[1:46:35] the truth before
[1:46:37] God every day if I go to
[1:46:42] sleep I tell God
[1:46:44] again that this was your
[1:46:50] day because since this morning
[1:46:54] to
[1:46:56] this it was
[1:47:00] you so this was your
[1:47:03] day this is your
[1:47:06] night have you heard me
[1:47:09] say when the natural sun goes
[1:47:19] down and that is
[1:47:21] Christ
[1:47:24] amen the Lord is my
[1:47:26] shepherd I shall not want when the Sun
[1:47:30] goes down he looks after he becomes my
[1:47:37] shepher when I'm not conscious of
[1:47:42] anything he is there as my
[1:47:46] shepher he looks after
[1:47:51] you when you wake up in the morning he
[1:47:55] is still with you that's why the morning
[1:47:58] we
[1:48:00] pray say thank you
[1:48:02] Lord you are with me the whole
[1:48:05] night because when the natural son goes
[1:48:10] down there is another
[1:48:13] son that is the Son of
[1:48:16] God
[1:48:18] Amen and when you
[1:48:21] sleep you are out of
[1:48:26] yourself no there must be
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:33] another because when you
[1:48:35] sleep you don't see you don't
[1:48:39] hear that's right now there must be
[1:48:46] some in
[1:48:48] you all right now I'm I will close by
[1:48:53] saying what did that scripture say of
[1:48:58] Hebrews the last thing I read this
[1:49:00] scripture almost every
[1:49:06] day just start from verse one a bit
[1:49:12] verse one wherefore holy
[1:49:15] Brethren partakers of the Heavenly
[1:49:18] calling consider the Apostle and high
[1:49:22] Prest of our profession Christ Jesus
[1:49:34] partak you are not called by a church
[1:49:37] not
[1:49:45] aor partakers partakers of the Heavenly
[1:49:49] calling consider the Apostle and priest
[1:49:53] of our profession Christ Jesus hey
[1:49:57] meaning that a
[1:49:59] Christian you
[1:50:03] have that's
[1:50:06] profession
[1:50:08] amen did you hear
[1:50:12] our Christ Jesus yes our
[1:50:18] profession that's my
[1:50:21] profession
[1:50:24] if even if you haven't been to
[1:50:28] school but still you have a
[1:50:35] profession amen am because you know
[1:50:43] today a person goes to
[1:50:49] school then after he has passed GPA and
[1:50:55] [Music]
[1:51:01] what they say he has a
[1:51:06] profession but listen to the
[1:51:13] right they call the word of
[1:51:17] God uh
[1:51:19] law if God
[1:51:21] says do
[1:51:24] they say it's a
[1:51:26] law all right amen
[1:51:30] now tell us about the profession
[1:51:34] profession consider the Apostle and high
[1:51:38] priest of our profession Christ
[1:51:42] Jesus okay who was faithful to him that
[1:51:46] appointed him as also Moses was faithful
[1:51:50] in all his
[1:51:51] house for this man was counted worthy of
[1:51:56] more Glory than
[1:51:58] Moses in as much as he who has builded
[1:52:03] the house has more honor than the house
[1:52:07] for every house is builded by some men
[1:52:11] but he that buth all things is
[1:52:16] godallah I think we have reached our
[1:52:21] point every day we read this
[1:52:26] scripture every house is build
[1:52:34] by but
[1:52:42] heaning cannot
[1:52:47] all yes because building don't just need
[1:52:51] bricks
[1:53:00] bricks the Bible says men can
[1:53:05] build with bricks but that's not
[1:53:11] all but he that bu all
[1:53:15] things meaning that building don't just
[1:53:19] end up with
[1:53:21] breaks
[1:53:24] amen we were somewhere I
[1:53:27] want call the country by
[1:53:32] name a brother came for us at to pick up

[1:54:15] problems he was pointing them because
[1:54:17] they have problems m m but divor they

[1:55:05] brother it's the it's God's not a
[1:55:09] blessed
[1:55:15] house
[1:55:17] now because you find some big
[1:55:21] houses but inside
[1:55:25] there you know it's just fights
[1:55:29] and no Harmony no peace in that
[1:55:37] house

[2:26:53] then I spoke to
[2:26:55] Mama and I spoke to my
[2:27:00] boys so I have a longing to do
[2:27:09] that that we came from a denomination
[2:27:16] and we were blessed
[2:27:19] there
[2:27:21] When we married me and
[2:27:23] her but now that we are

[2:27:36] blessing of our
[2:27:40] marage are P but there is a
[2:27:47] pastor then I spoke to the ERS
[2:27:51] they spoke to the pastor are
[2:27:55] corre the blessing of the
[2:27:58] Lord Upon Our
[2:28:01] Lives we were baptized in the name of
[2:28:04] the the Father the Son and the Holy
[2:28:06] Ghost
[2:28:10] there but when we
[2:28:12] arrive where God is there was a
[2:28:17] correction so we are correcting also
[2:28:19] this
[2:28:21] amen
[2:28:22] amen
[2:28:27] oh
[2:28:30] yeah now not not preaching
[2:28:34] but you remind me
[2:28:37] of I was with the sister last Sunday
[2:28:43] remember one on
[2:28:47] one after I
[2:28:51] her she some
[2:28:55] questions then at the
[2:28:57] end she say I think I must be
[2:29:03] baptized I was
[2:29:05] baptized she
[2:29:08] from what church was
[2:29:12] that Gospel of Faith Mission or
[2:29:15] something like that Full Gospel of Faith
[2:29:17] Mission now she
[2:29:18] says but I
[2:29:21] think bapm was the right
[2:29:25] one I said which
[2:29:27] one she
[2:29:30] says the usual one in the name of the
[2:29:33] father son
[2:29:37] and and I said what is that
[2:29:43] mean because Father Son and Holy
[2:29:46] Ghost
[2:29:49] there but in the
[2:29:51] name of the
[2:29:54] father I made it so
[2:29:57] simple he was the
[2:30:00] father to
[2:30:02] isra for to die he became a
[2:30:06] son the body
[2:30:09] ofh then after that his
[2:30:13] father son then after
[2:30:17] that he ascended up to heaven
[2:30:22] the Holy Ghost came
[2:30:24] down those are the
[2:30:27] titles
[2:30:28] [Music]
[2:30:30] and he

[2:30:36] in now we know that father son and H
[2:30:40] Father Son and Holy
[2:30:44] [Music]
[2:30:49] Ghost now if you baptize them in the
[2:30:53] name the Bible
