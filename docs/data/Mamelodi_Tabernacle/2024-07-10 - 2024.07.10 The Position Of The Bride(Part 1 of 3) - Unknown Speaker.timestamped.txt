[0:02] [Music]
[0:52] God bless you
[0:56] am we greet you again in the name of our
[0:59] Lord Jesus
[1:05] Christ thank God
[1:09] for day of the
[1:23] week all
[1:28] p brothers and
[1:34] sisters so
[1:38] we we have a we have a testimony that
[1:43] God has done us very good
[1:57] here so today we
[2:00] just want to look at the position of
[2:15] the 14
[2:26] verse John 14
[2:36] 20 l
[3:03] [Music]
[3:10] [Applause]
[3:14] [Music]
[3:16] Revelation
[3:21] 3 vers 14
[3:32] [Music]
[3:58] 2 for
[4:13] [Applause]
[4:17] [Music]
[4:24] [Music]
[4:30] let's
[4:31] pray heavenly father it's
[4:35] another glorious time to
[4:44] be time
[4:47] said I was glad when they said to me let
[4:50] us goto the house of the Lord
[4:58] [Applause]
[5:01] [Music]
[5:08] our spirit brought us to this
[5:12] [Music]
[5:14] house we pray that the blessing fall
[5:17] upon all that are in the
[5:23] house as we open the Bible again for the
[5:27] reading of the word of God
[5:32] we asking for the blessings
[5:35] and understanding
[5:45] from amen
[5:47] now the prophet says now this day is the
[5:52] reflection of all thees
[5:59] [Music]
[6:02] so the light of all the other ages is in
[6:06] this
[6:12] time so we we have the light of seven
[6:17] Church
[6:21] ages now at this day at that day the the
[6:27] prophet says that is this
[6:37] when this Revelation is made
[6:43] known he said then I will be you shall
[6:48] know that I am in
[6:54] you you shall
[6:58] know so I want to read something
[7:03] again now it speaks of the knowledge we
[7:06] will
[7:10] have for it says we shall
[7:17] know so do you
[7:21] know P 33
[7:29] [Music]
[7:31] when the prophet preached
[7:34] there on that day he
[7:38] said the
[7:41] Christ in the
[7:44] church is just been made
[7:53] known the
[7:55] Christ be made known
[8:03] the whole thing is the revelation of
[8:08] God so this is the day
[8:11] God has given us the
[8:21] knowledge and if we go back
[8:25] again H just to lay a foundation for
[8:29] some a few
[8:32] [Music]
[8:34] minutes the prophet speaking
[8:40] here he says you know
[8:50] [Music]
[8:53] things Christ in
[8:56] you makes you
[9:00] the complete
[9:03] [Music]
[9:08] reation
[9:10] amen so it's not the fact that you have
[9:13] a revelation
[9:20] [Music]
[9:23] but that is the revelation of Christ
[9:30] the revelation of the son of
[9:35] men not the Son of
[9:37] [Music]
[9:42] God through theeven churches he is the
[9:46] Son of
[9:52] God but at the end of the seven Church
[9:55] ages he is the son of men
[10:05] now the son of man means God is
[10:16] here now before the seven
[10:21] churches he
[10:23] was
[10:28] of to the
[10:31] Jews for three and a half
[10:36] [Music]
[10:38] years he was the son of
[10:41] men not the Son of
[10:45] God as the prophet
[10:48] says he became the son he changed to the
[10:53] Son of God on the day of Pentecost
[10:58] [Music]
[11:05] CH from the son of the Son of God on the
[11:09] day of
[11:15] P now before he died he was not a
[11:24] mediator the Bible
[11:27] says he became a
[11:30] after the
[11:32] [Music]
[11:35] resurrection imator is
[11:39] anbody standing for
[11:43] [Music]
[11:46] you but when he was
[11:50] on they didn't need a mediator because
[11:53] he was with them
[12:01] when he was the son of
[12:05] men he was
[12:09] not because he was here with
[12:13] [Music]
[12:16] them he became a
[12:20] mediator after he
[12:24] left then the Bible
[12:27] says he ascended to the right of the
[12:34] maest but before
[12:37] that when he walked here on
[12:40] Earth he was not a
[12:44] mediator was the son of
[12:49] men so they didn't need a
[12:53] [Music]
[12:55] mediator because they could just speak
[12:57] to him
[13:03] in the book
[13:06] ofis it was
[13:12] and
[13:17] Med
[13:22] need so God just spoke to
[13:27] Adam andam
[13:38] [Music]
[13:45] and did you know
[13:47] that the third
[13:50] PO he says I will
[13:59] am
[14:00] so with the you don't need a
[14:05] [Music]
[14:19] [Music]
[14:25] mediator God was in the Jesus
[14:31] and God today as we are going to
[14:35] read
[14:42] is
[14:44] after he switch
[14:49] down he became
[14:54] us and now at the
[14:57] end he the Christ comes
[15:01] down and Jesus
[15:03] says I'm going back to where I
[15:10] was now where he was he was
[15:18] l so he does
[15:26] [Music]
[15:27] this we the Son of
[15:33] God the Bible says Adam was the son
[15:40] of after the
[15:43] fall God had to come
[15:46] down to close the
[15:51] gap because Adam left
[15:57] again that's why God said where are
[16:06] you
[16:07] says the Lord Jesus came
[16:11] down and sprinkled
[16:22] blood when Adam left the place
[16:29] so the network was
[16:34] broken between men
[16:38] [Music]
[16:41] and the connection was
[16:46] broken so since no one could close the
[16:54] gap he had to
[16:57] come with the sword the
[17:01] word to stand there in the
[17:05] Gap and
[17:07] Di
[17:14] [Music]
[17:16] and so that you could bring men back to
[17:19] the Post
[17:29] became the redeemed
[17:32] [Music]
[17:38] Adam
[17:49] he
[17:55] standing
[17:57] so because you come to the seven Church
[18:02] age then it was a
[18:21] [Music]
[18:24] g so
[18:26] that to bring men
[18:29] with
[18:38] again the pyramid now has no
[18:44] [Music]
[18:50] [Music]
[18:51] Gap chist
[18:57] [Music]
[19:18] the
[19:20] of
[19:25] body all
[19:27] right now the
[19:29] brother speaks again
[19:33] here I want to read this
[19:37] part he
[19:39] says
[19:41] look what was once God's Great
[19:48] secret the great mysterious Secret in
[19:52] his
[19:54] [Music]
[19:58] now put in the hearts of the
[20:09] believer that's
[20:12] why that's
[20:16] why says the people are now getting
[20:19] nothing from
[20:32] because he has come
[20:41] [Music]
[20:41] [Applause]
[20:43] [Music]
[20:45] down for the Bible
[20:47] said to the
[20:49] Jews the god whom you
[20:53] seek the God you are looking
[20:56] for shall come to his temp
[20:59] [Music]
[21:04] they were supposed to meet him in the
[21:11] temple now the thing
[21:15] was temp a
[21:18] [Music]
[21:22] Manus so they went to the temple
[21:29] they missed
[21:32] him because he was in the
[21:36] [Music]
[21:49] human they couldn't get
[21:52] [Music]
[21:54] an
[21:56] because the God who they tried to pray
[21:59] to was in the
[22:02] [Music]
[22:06] [Applause]
[22:09] temp they from
[22:16] them he
[22:19] said I am
[22:22] [Music]

[24:06] God is not
[24:12] just you
[24:17] [Music]
[24:20] [Applause]
[24:22] find there somewhere in the Bible
[24:29] I think the book of
[24:37] Gans in the book of
[24:41] Galatians chapter
[24:46] 1
[24:48] verse 21 to 24
[25:04] [Music]
[25:16] 21 to 244 am
[25:23] [Music]
[25:29] [Music]

[25:42] says they glorified God in
[25:48] Me yes so they glorify God in Paul
[26:04] 15 Read verse
[26:14] [Music]
[26:22] [Music]
[26:36] amen
[26:38] am now Paul
[26:43] says he revealed Christ in
[26:50] him for him to preach
[26:56] him you know today
[26:59] he revealed Christ to
[27:02] USU to
[27:04] preach not not to his to
[27:15] [Music]
[27:18] hu he in the beginning was the
[27:23] way but when the was manifested
[27:28] it was
[27:36] himu
[27:39] Isaiah
[27:41] prophesy it was a
[27:46] prophecy hallu but when the prophecy was
[27:51] fulfilled then it was
[27:56] [Music]
[27:58] now they no longer preach a prophecy
[28:01] they preach
[28:12] him when he was still
[28:17] coming we preach him we preach the
[28:23] way coming
[28:28] but when he has
[28:31] come we the that he is
[28:36] coming but we preach
[28:42] [Music]
[28:45] him you
[28:50] [Music]
[28:51] know I just want to read John
[28:56] 4u and look at
[29:03] difference verse
[29:09] 39
[29:11] [Music]
[29:16] 49 just read from 39 to
[29:22] 429 John
[29:24] 4
[29:27] 39-42 for
[29:38] [Music]
[29:55] [Music]
[30:07] [Music]
[30:16] now at first they had the Samaritan
[30:22] [Music]
[30:24] woman they came because of her testimony
[30:30] amen then
[30:36] secondly so when the samarit were come
[30:39] unto
[30:48] himto now him is a man
[30:58] yes now it was no a
[31:04] [Music]
[31:05] testimony
[31:07] because they will come unto
[31:13] [Music]
[31:15] him and many more
[31:19] believed because of his
[31:25] [Music]
[31:28] not of
[31:35] [Music]
[31:43] the
[31:45] 42 and said unto the woman now now we
[31:53] believe not because of your saying
[32:00] for we have him
[32:05] ourselves
[32:11] hallu it's no
[32:21] the all right
[32:24] amen now let's go back to our scripture
[32:31] brother
[32:33] says read
[32:40] of
[32:42] church
[32:43] church is now supposed to be taking the
[32:47] place of
[32:53] Christ
[32:54] that
[32:56] amen
[32:59] four reading
[33:02] here that's the
[33:07] position
[33:08] because Christ
[33:11] himself the prophet
[33:13] says Christ is now in his position in
[33:24] the so is a time to Christ take his
[33:28] position and the bride also taking her
[33:32] [Music]
[33:37] position Christ takes the position as a
[33:41] husband and bride takes
[33:54] POS now if the people believe in Christ
[34:01] then the bright takes the place of
[34:09] Christ makes
[34:12] [Music]
[34:15] and now let me ask a
[34:18] question then where
[34:21] is
[34:25] hallelu okay
[34:37] now what was once great
[34:44] secret that
[34:51] [Music]
[34:56] means you know people are talking about
[34:59] the God who
[35:03] was but today is the
[35:11] god begin
[35:20] [Music]
[35:29] that's why the took the
[35:33] book and came
[35:35] down because the book didn't
[35:39] there it was coming
[35:42] [Music]
[35:49] down what
[35:52] Wasing toist
[36:01] the coming into the
[36:06] [Music]
[36:13] body God gave them laws some
[36:18] laws but God changed the
[36:22] [Music]
[36:24] Covenant and he said this is the New
[36:29] Covenant I'm going to put the LA in
[36:38] them all
[36:40] right now our New
[36:43] Covenant that God has put Christ in
[36:51] us hallelujah
[36:55] [Music]
[36:58] this great
[37:02] Secret in his
[37:06] mind and says
[37:20] Philippians souls in prison he says that
[37:24] mind that was in Christ is your soul
[37:34] [Music]
[37:36] that
[37:37] means God has put his mind in
[37:44] you it's the
[37:49] soul and he says this
[37:52] soul is God's
[38:07] made a place in a
[38:13] man so
[38:15] that when he
[38:17] comes he comes to that
[38:25] place that's why I can that he has
[38:34] come why
[38:36] because he come
[38:54] to he
[38:58] now you can preach
[39:00] him because he came to
[39:03] [Music]
[39:06] you
[39:09] okay that
[39:11] book there's a
[39:14] book it says you know
[39:17] it when Christ comes to he comes when
[39:22] comes to he comes to his
[39:26] [Music]
[39:30] all
[39:31] right
[39:33] now the church is now supposed to be
[39:37] taking the place of
[39:43] Christ caring on his
[39:46] [Music]
[39:48] ministry
[39:50] hallu I read
[39:52] again of a perfect man
[39:58] God dwells in the St of a man
[40:11] [Music]
