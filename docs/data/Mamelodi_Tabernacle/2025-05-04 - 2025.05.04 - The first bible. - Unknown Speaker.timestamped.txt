[38:02] the place of worship.
[38:05] We have been pulled Lord Almighty
[38:09] by what you had for us this morning.
[38:15] We come to thee Lord
[38:17] Almighty calling
[38:19] upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[38:24] because thou has loved
[38:26] us and has called us from among people
[38:32] to be your bride.
[38:35] Now your bride Lord Almighty has come
[38:38] this morning to your presence.
[38:41] We therefore invite you
[38:44] knowing father that you came down with a
[38:47] book
[38:49] and when you called those names
[38:52] we heard our names
[38:55] and father we responded to that now that
[38:59] we have responded father you are lord
[39:03] almighty
[39:04] giving us the fruit of the land.
[39:09] So we are here Lord
[39:11] Almighty knowing that we have crossed
[39:13] over
[39:15] and Lord we intend to receive from thee.
[39:19] We would like to thank you father for
[39:20] the love that you have shown unto us
[39:24] for the revelation that you have shown
[39:26] unto us and the power that you have
[39:29] given us this morning again father we
[39:33] are saying unto thee father. Thank you
[39:37] father for giving us such a ministry.
[39:41] The ministry of the seventh sea and
[39:44] ministry of the revealed word the
[39:47] ministry of the revelation of the seven
[39:50] sea. We would like to thank you, Father,
[39:52] for what you have done unto our lives.
[39:55] And we're looking forward even today,
[39:57] Lord, to hear the pastor standing behind
[40:01] this pullpit and Lord, giving us that
[40:04] spiritual food that is due to this
[40:08] season, Lord Almighty. Thank you, Lord.
[40:12] May you bless everybody that is in here,
[40:14] Lord. May you forgive them all their
[40:17] wrongs, Lord Almighty. May you be the
[40:20] one Lord Almighty that will stand and
[40:22] anoint our pastor and inspire him. Lord
[40:26] Almighty, thank you father for you've
[40:29] even given us power
[40:32] to act according to your promise
[40:36] you said in your promise gracious Lord
[40:39] the gates of hell
[40:42] shall not prevail.
[40:45] Therefore, Lord
[40:47] Almighty, when we read this scripture,
[40:50] it shows that the church that you will
[40:52] build will be the one that the gates of
[40:55] hell will not prevail against it. The
[40:59] power that you've given us, the
[41:01] revelation that you've given us
[41:04] are suitable for this church, Lord.
[41:08] And Father, they are enough for us,
[41:10] Lord.
[41:11] We are now saying to the evil spirit
[41:15] that he hasn't got the devil himself. He
[41:19] hasn't got any promise. Only the promise
[41:22] gathered in here. And now anybody that
[41:26] is not part of the promise,
[41:29] we call upon the name of our Lord Jesus
[41:31] Christ and we command the spirit of the
[41:35] evil one not to prevail here
[41:41] because it's only the children of God
[41:44] that are here. Hallelujah. We are here
[41:46] to to hear the word of God. Amen. And
[41:50] when we get out of this place, we would
[41:53] like to say, Lord, thank you
[41:56] for speaking to us. And thank you,
[42:00] Father, for revealing yourself unto us.
[42:03] And thank you, Father, for bringing us
[42:07] into one accord and one spirit and one
[42:10] soul, Lord Almighty. Thank you, Father.
[42:13] So we are calling you gracious heavenly
[42:16] father with our hearts open with our
[42:19] minds open with our spirits open to say
[42:23] take control lord. Thank you father for
[42:26] we pray in the name of our lord Jesus
[42:29] Christ. Amen.

[2:19:44] [Music]
[2:19:47] Christ. Can you read the scripture for
[2:19:50] us
[2:19:57] please? And they brought young children
[2:20:00] to him. That's Mark chapter 10 from
[2:20:04] verse 13 to verse 16.
[2:20:07] And they brought young children to him
[2:20:10] that he should touch them. And his
[2:20:13] disciple rebuked those that brought
[2:20:15] them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much
[2:20:19] displeased and said unto them, "Suffer
[2:20:23] the little children to come unto me, and
[2:20:25] forbid them not. For of such is the
[2:20:29] kingdom of God." Amen. Veryily I say
[2:20:32] unto you, whosoever shall not receive
[2:20:36] the kingdom of God as a little child, he
[2:20:40] shall not enter the in. And he took them
[2:20:44] up in his arms, put his hands upon them,
[2:20:47] and blessed them. Thank you, my brother.
[2:20:51] Children are the pride of
[2:20:53] their mothers.
[2:20:56] [Music]
[2:21:01] Because the Bible says you shall be
[2:21:03] saved in
[2:21:07] childbearing. Cowards don't want to bear
[2:21:12] children. They're afraid of birth
[2:21:18] pains. I'm happy to see you,
[2:21:23] sister bringing the child unto Christ.
[2:21:28] Amen.

[2:21:53] mothers in those days.
[2:21:56] We don't know what it was in their
[2:21:59] hearts,
[2:22:01] but the Bible says they
[2:22:03] brought their children unto him
[2:22:06] so that he can touch them.
[2:22:10] I've I've taken the child in my hand,
[2:22:15] believing that is not mine. You are
[2:22:18] using my hand to touch this child. Amen.
[2:22:23] Father,
[2:22:25] I bless this church this morning. Amen.
[2:22:29] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:22:33] You are blessed, my child. Amen.
[2:22:37] [Applause]
[2:22:56] Father, I really
[2:22:59] believe you are still the same
[2:23:01] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:23:04] You don't change.
[2:23:06] Here is the child. Amen.
[2:23:09] living in this generation
[2:23:12] where the spirit of hell
[2:23:15] has come out to anoint children
[2:23:19] in different ways.
[2:23:22] Parents are no more able to control
[2:23:24] their children.
[2:23:27] Father standing here against any other
[2:23:31] form of devil spirit that they may not
[2:23:35] touch this child. Amen. I bring this
[2:23:37] child to thy hand in the name of the
[2:23:40] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

[2:25:27] apostles and some prophets and some
[2:25:32] evangelist and some pastors and teachers
[2:25:37] for the perfection of the saints for the
[2:25:40] work of the ministry
[2:25:43] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[2:25:46] till we all come in the unity of the
[2:25:49] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[2:25:53] God. Amen. Unto a perfect man, unto the
[2:25:57] measure of the stature of the fullness
[2:26:01] of Christ. Amen.
[2:26:02] that we hence fought be no more children
[2:26:07] to and fro and carried about with every
[2:26:11] wind of doctrine by the slights of men
[2:26:16] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[2:26:21] in wait to deceive. Amen.
[2:26:25] You may take your seat.
[2:26:29] We are living in
[2:26:32] a
[2:26:36] generation. We are living in a
[2:26:40] time which is a dangerous
[2:26:46] time where people have taken this
[2:26:50] noble gift
[2:26:54] [Music]
[2:26:57] to be the post.
[2:27:00] to be
[2:27:06] contested. But where we have
[2:27:10] read this is not supposed to be
[2:27:15] contested is a gift from
[2:27:19] God. The Bible says God says I will give
[2:27:24] you pastors.
[2:27:29] He doesn't say you shall choose pastors.
[2:27:33] He says I will give you.
[2:27:38] But in our days
[2:27:40] here, we find
[2:27:43] ships, raising their little
[2:27:46] [Music]
[2:27:47] hands. I want to be a pastor. I want to
[2:27:51] be a
[2:27:53] pastor. Amen.
[2:27:58] people. Now
[2:28:02] you say in a
[2:28:04] congregation you find four or
[2:28:08] five they say all they wanted to be
[2:28:13] pastors but the Bible says God says I
[2:28:17] will give
[2:28:20] you he didn't say you will desire to be
[2:28:24] pastor he says I
[2:28:29] He said when he has risen
[2:28:32] up he he sent
[2:28:37] gifts some becomes
[2:28:40] prophets some
[2:28:43] apostles. It was
[2:28:46] gifts given to those
[2:28:48] people by God.
[2:28:55] Let me read something here.
[2:28:58] God
[2:29:00] willing. He says here
[2:29:07] 105 105 there is five offices elected of
[2:29:14] God. For God set in the church apostles,
[2:29:21] prophets,
[2:29:23] teachers, pastors,
[2:29:26] evangelist who said in the church sorry
[2:29:29] who said these people in the
[2:29:33] church says God
[2:29:37] amen it doesn't say
[2:29:40] you say
[2:29:43] God
[2:29:46] amen who sent you to say I want to be a
[2:29:51] pastor who told You
[2:29:57] I want to be a
[2:30:00] You think this is a post to be
[2:30:06] contested. You want
[2:30:08] panels
[2:30:09] panel to
[2:30:15] interview. This is not a post to be
[2:30:20] contested. is a gift from God.
[2:30:26] [Applause]
[2:30:28] Amen. The Bible says here,
[2:30:32] let me go on. He says God did that
[2:30:38] man has
[2:30:41] deacons. Who has
[2:30:48] deacons and so forth.
[2:30:51] and
[2:30:52] everything. But you see, God set in the
[2:30:59] church for perfecting of the
[2:31:04] church. Man has
[2:31:06] deacons. God has
[2:31:09] pastors. Amen.
[2:31:18] What are we doing?
[2:31:22] We
[2:31:24] identify the gift in a
[2:31:28] man. Amen. After identifying the gift in
[2:31:32] a
[2:31:33] man, then we say this is a
[2:31:37] pastor because we have seen the gift of
[2:31:42] pastorship in this
[2:31:45] man. Amen. You see the man who has a
[2:31:49] gift is the man who is running from that
[2:31:51] gift.
[2:31:57] It's not the man who say I am.
[2:32:05] Amen.
[2:32:07] Are you together with
[2:32:09] me? Are you
[2:32:11] listening? Amen.
[2:32:15] Amen. He says
[2:32:17] in the book of revelation, book of
[2:32:19] symbols
[2:32:22] 58 58 he said the pastor is a shepherd.
[2:32:29] He says the Holy
[2:32:32] Ghost. He don't say man.
[2:32:35] The Holy
[2:32:37] Ghost has made
[2:32:39] him overseer.
[2:32:43] Who made over here?
[2:32:51] Amen. Where do you come in?
[2:33:01] Overseer of his church.
[2:33:07] Unless that church is not God's church.
[2:33:12] It is not God's church. You can choose
[2:33:15] your own
[2:33:17] pastor. Amen. Boys
[2:33:22] nowadays they raise their hands. I'm a
[2:33:25] pastor. Hey, choose me. I want to be a
[2:33:30] pastor. Because he want
[2:33:33] money. He's making this a post.
[2:33:42] A pastor from
[2:33:44] God, he can pastor four or five
[2:33:51] people. Those who didn't have
[2:33:54] money, those don't have those who don't
[2:33:57] have
[2:33:58] money because he's a
[2:34:02] pastor. He is looking over the
[2:34:06] souls, not over the pockets.
[2:34:20] Amen. He is the Holy Ghost made him an
[2:34:25] overseer. Amen.
[2:34:29] Is it me who says this?
[2:34:35] The Holy Ghost has made him an overseer.
[2:34:37] Amen.
[2:34:41] over his
[2:34:43] church, the
[2:34:45] flock to feed
[2:34:48] them with
[2:34:50] what? The word of
[2:34:53] God.
[2:34:55] Amen. I will give you
[2:34:57] pastors who will feed
[2:35:00] you with knowledge and
[2:35:03] understanding. Amen. A sheep without a
[2:35:06] shepherd
[2:35:09] is a
[2:35:11] [Music]
[2:35:19] parame is a lost
[2:35:24] sheep. A sheep cannot guide
[2:35:27] itself. It needs a
[2:35:30] shepherd. Amen.
[2:35:35] A
[2:35:36] shepherd.
[2:35:37] Christ is the
[2:35:39] shepherd. Amen. To shepherd his sheep,
[2:35:45] he needs a
[2:35:52] man. Let me read something
[2:35:55] here for you to understand.
[2:35:59] It says
[2:36:02] here, what do we do?
[2:36:05] We identified the
[2:36:09] gift. I have identified the
[2:36:12] gift. In
[2:36:16] fact, if the
[2:36:19] church has identified the
[2:36:23] gift, they must go to the
[2:36:26] pastor of a
[2:36:29] church. They must they must go there.
[2:36:33] They must tell the pastor we have
[2:36:36] identified the
[2:36:37] gift in this
[2:36:40] brother. We want this
[2:36:43] brother to be the
[2:36:45] pastor because we have seen that
[2:36:48] gift and the pastor will say give me
[2:36:52] chance.
[2:36:55] I'm still going to look
[2:36:57] [Music]
[2:36:58] at if you really want the
[2:37:02] pastor. Amen. Give the pastor chance.
[2:37:07] You must pray over your
[2:37:11] request. He must see what you are
[2:37:16] seeing. Then we come back to
[2:37:20] you. What did you want? you what did
[2:37:23] what did you want us to orain the
[2:37:27] pastor because I
[2:37:29] also agree with
[2:37:35] you are you
[2:37:37] together but if you just bring a
[2:37:40] man a
[2:37:42] pastor this man we just ordain the
[2:37:46] man because you say he's a
[2:37:50] pastor it's Not us,
[2:37:54] but you ask us.
[2:38:03] Then the prophet says here,
[2:38:06] now the Bible
[2:38:08] times, the way they ordain a
[2:38:12] minister was by recognizing a gift of
[2:38:18] God in this minister.
[2:38:22] or ministering.
[2:38:25] Is it me?
[2:38:28] Okay. If it's not me,
[2:38:32] then they notice
[2:38:35] him being a staunch
[2:38:39] Christian and also a gift of
[2:38:45] speaking. That here is talking about
[2:38:48] Timote. They say, "And they laid hands
[2:38:51] upon
[2:38:53] him as a
[2:38:59] recognition." They
[2:39:01] recognize now.
[2:39:04] Are you
[2:39:05] together? Amen. That is what I'm going
[2:39:07] to
[2:39:11] do. Elders
[2:39:14] told me that they have already done the
[2:39:17] the other process.
[2:39:23] I I'm just going to
[2:39:26] [Music]
[2:39:28] ordain. But before I ordain,
[2:39:32] I must tell
[2:39:34] you who is the
[2:39:38] pastor.
[2:39:40] Amen. And I have told
[2:39:43] you who is the pastor.
[2:39:50] Who elect the person
[2:39:55] is God
[2:39:58] himself. Amen.
[2:40:03] Then
[2:40:05] we just lay
[2:40:09] hands. The apostolic
[2:40:13] ministry. We go on. The elders of the
[2:40:16] church
[2:40:19] lay hands upon
[2:40:22] him recognizing this
[2:40:26] man and
[2:40:28] placing and placing
[2:40:31] him. the apostolic ministry of laying
[2:40:37] hands on
[2:40:39] him that he would go and preach the
[2:40:44] gospel that they believe that the gift
[2:40:47] of
[2:40:49] God they believe
[2:40:51] what the gift of
[2:40:55] God was working in
[2:41:00] him put me pastor
[2:41:05] I want
[2:41:09] papers. Who told
[2:41:14] you these young boys all over
[2:41:19] here? They wanted to be pastors.
[2:41:23] I am also a pastor.
[2:41:30] Who who has recognized that gift?
[2:41:39] They just go to
[2:41:42] people without the
[2:41:46] experience ordain me.
[2:41:50] [Music]
[2:41:55] It's just like children playing
[2:41:59] outside. They know during the night they
[2:42:04] will go at
[2:42:14] home. God is going to judge them.
[2:42:20] One of the good days
[2:42:24] This not the playing game.
[2:42:29] That is the way they did also to the
[2:42:34] ministers by laying hands on
[2:42:38] them and giving them the right hand of
[2:42:45] fellowship. I'm going to give my
[2:42:48] brother the right hand of fellowship.
[2:42:54] Amen. I'm going to say from today on
[2:43:00] you are also my
[2:43:03] pastor.
[2:43:08] Hallelujah to work
[2:43:11] together as an agreement before
[2:43:14] God. that they seen the
[2:43:19] gift working in this
[2:43:22] brother. I believe the
[2:43:25] brothers who have come with the pastor
[2:43:28] the pastor to
[2:43:30] be they've seen the
[2:43:36] gift says he witnessed
[2:43:44] that he was that he was called
[2:43:49] for
[2:43:52] something. Make me a
[2:44:03] pastor. Troubles.
[2:44:09] Where did you get it?
[2:44:14] That is what the prophet is saying
[2:44:17] here that she was called for
[2:44:23] something. Amen. Predestinated
[2:44:29] pastor by
[2:44:31] God.
[2:44:35] Amen. And we believe it.
[2:44:39] And they lay hands on
[2:44:41] him that God will bless
[2:44:44] him. And it was a sanction.
[2:44:50] When we
[2:44:51] sing, when we
[2:44:54] sing, we shall call the
[2:44:57] brothers with the
[2:45:01] brothers to come here.
[2:45:04] Amen to be
[2:45:06] ordained. Amen.
[2:45:10] As I passed
[2:45:15] with the power invested upon
[2:45:20] me by the
[2:45:25] ordination of my
[2:45:33] father. I'm also going to do the same
[2:45:36] thing.
[2:45:39] He transferred the power of
[2:45:42] God. He recognized that
[2:45:45] power in
[2:45:47] me. He sanctioned the
[2:45:52] power. That that power must go
[2:45:57] on. Then I take
[2:45:59] it. I'm going to place it in my bra.
[2:46:06] With the powers from
[2:46:09] heaven, we are going to ordain
[2:46:13] them from
[2:46:18] today. In fact, he was the pastor from
[2:46:21] the
[2:46:26] beginning. God doesn't
[2:46:31] start. He's not like me. When I start
[2:46:36] things when you are the pastor, you were
[2:46:39] the
[2:46:40] pastor. Amen. He knew who will be ships
[2:46:45] under
[2:46:52] [Music]
[2:46:53] you. by
[2:46:55] accident. When people go away, they go
[2:46:59] away because they were not predestined
[2:47:01] to be under
[2:47:05] you. They must just
[2:47:09] go. Why are they wasting
[2:47:11] time? Why are they wasting
[2:47:16] time? Listen, listen, listen, listen.
[2:47:23] Oh my
[2:47:28] father
[2:47:29] [Music]
[2:47:32] forgiving as your
[2:47:36] [Music]
[2:47:39] son
[2:47:44] and
[2:47:46] [Music]
[2:47:48] your
[2:47:50] children your
[2:47:53] on earth
[2:47:55] and is down. We say thank you Lord.
[2:48:02] Thank you oh my
[2:48:11] [Music]
[2:48:12] father. Hallelujah.
[2:48:19] [Music]
[2:48:22] brother.
[2:48:29] [Music]
[2:48:31] Hallelujah. Your
[2:48:33] [Music]
[2:48:36] word
[2:48:39] is your spirit.
[2:48:46] [Music]
[2:48:56] Heaven me
[2:48:59] father now and here
[2:49:04] Lord as your
[2:49:07] children here are men of God elders of
[2:49:11] the
[2:49:12] church they are laying their hands on
[2:49:15] this brother here this
[2:49:18] morning in your
[2:49:21] name to sanction this
[2:49:25] brother to give this
[2:49:28] brother the right of
[2:49:31] way. We are not giving people
[2:49:35] gifts. We don't have those
[2:49:38] powers. We just recognize the gifts that
[2:49:41] we have already placed in a man. Then we
[2:49:44] just put our
[2:49:46] hands to
[2:49:48] sanction what we have already done.
[2:49:52] We believe Lord you have chosen this
[2:49:55] brother to lead your children
[2:49:59] there
[2:50:04] to feed them
[2:50:06] not with his own knowledge
[2:50:10] but with the
[2:50:12] knowledge from you
[2:50:16] because you have said through the mouth
[2:50:17] of the prophet
[2:50:19] the Holy Ghost will take the weight
[2:50:23] and bring it direct to the pastor so
[2:50:26] that the pastor can take it and feed the
[2:50:28] sheep.
[2:50:30] Believe from now
[2:50:32] on will add to what has already had. The
[2:50:36] Holy Ghost
[2:50:38] will go on doing his work in the life of
[2:50:42] our brother. I pray in the name of the
[2:50:46] Lord Jesus
[2:50:49] Christ. Amen.
[2:50:54] Amen.
[2:51:08] [Music]
[2:51:18] your
[2:51:23] son
[2:51:27] and your sweet
[2:51:31] [Music]
[2:51:40] We say thank you
[2:51:45] [Music]
[2:51:51] [Applause]
[2:51:53] Lord
[2:51:54] [Music]
[2:51:57] for your
[2:52:00] [Music]
[2:52:03] son and
[2:52:05] [Music]
[2:52:13] Oh,
[2:52:16] your
[2:52:19] name
[2:52:20] [Music]
[2:52:26] is Thank you. You may take your
[2:52:33] seats. We are about to
[2:52:40] to
[2:52:41] receive on the
[2:52:46] platform the
[2:52:53] ark back in Israel there is
[2:53:00] to to to know that the
[2:53:03] ark is coming.
[2:53:07] You will hear by the
[2:53:16] noise. And we have more than them.
[2:53:23] More than
[2:53:27] them. We have got the
[2:53:31] [Music]
[2:53:33] real. Amen. It was the wood there,
[2:53:43] but now here
[2:53:45] is a
[2:53:47] man.
[2:53:51] Amen. They knew that their God was in
[2:53:54] that
[2:54:00] wood. And when the wood come
[2:54:05] You will see what you have not you have
[2:54:08] never seen.
[2:54:11] [Music]
[2:54:12] The emotions of the
[2:54:14] people knowing that their God
[2:54:18] is even if they they have not seen
[2:54:22] him but they know that is in
[2:54:28] this. We also must
[2:54:31] know that is in this man.
[2:54:35] [Applause]
[2:54:40] Amen. We must
[2:54:41] get excited,
[2:54:48] excitement knowing that he's coming at
[2:54:51] you.
[2:54:54] Amen. Our acceptance
[2:54:59] will bring heaven
[2:55:03] down. Our
[2:55:06] resentment will stop
[2:55:11] heaven. But if there is one who
[2:55:16] resent or two or
[2:55:21] three, I am asking God to forgive them.
[2:55:26] [Music]
[2:55:28] because the pillar of fire will strike
[2:55:33] them. But now I'm going to stand between
[2:55:35] them and
[2:55:39] God as
[2:55:41] Moses has
[2:55:43] standed in the
[2:55:45] wilderness when God was about to strike
[2:55:50] them. Moses turned the day
[2:55:56] while we stand up. I think so.
[2:56:00] Then we sing
[2:56:03] our
[2:56:13] [Music]
[2:56:18] song when
[2:56:22] he sh
[2:56:24] [Music]
[2:56:27] begin to
[2:56:35] sound.
[2:56:37] All should be
[2:56:40] finished. As
[2:56:43] he has
[2:56:45] declared to
[2:56:49] his
[2:56:51] prophets, behold
[2:56:53] Lord have sent
[2:56:56] [Music]
[2:56:59] you and
[2:57:01] prophets
[2:57:05] [Music]
[2:57:07] before
[2:57:12] and
[2:57:14] he
[2:57:20] shall of their fathers.
[2:57:23] to their
[2:57:25] children. their
[2:57:27] hearts of their
[2:57:30] children to their
[2:57:35] father. I
[2:57:37] [Music]
[2:57:45] come the
[2:57:48] earth with a
[2:57:54] kiss.
[2:57:58] [Music]
[2:58:04] Holy Spe.

[2:58:31] Power will come.

[3:09:24] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:09:27] If you still remember during
[3:09:37] marts the church would
[3:09:41] sing until they are
[3:09:44] tired while Martin was in his
[3:09:49] office trying to connect with
[3:09:53] God and he won't get in.
[3:09:57] If he if he's not connected,
[3:10:01] our
[3:10:02] Martin is still trying to
[3:10:04] [Music]
[3:10:06] connect. He's still taking this number
[3:10:10] one. He's trying to connect these
[3:10:13] things. It's not for the first time
[3:10:17] here. People want to bring something to
[3:10:20] the people of
[3:10:22] God.
[3:10:24] People who want to bring
[3:10:28] something, they just don't rush to the
[3:10:31] pulpit.
[3:10:34] They take their
[3:10:37] time until they feel that they must they
[3:10:40] can go
[3:10:43] there. They have got
[3:10:45] something that they can present to the
[3:10:48] children of God.
[3:10:50] You are the children of
[3:10:54] God. No one has the right to play with
[3:10:58] you.
[3:11:02] That's why when we come in front of
[3:11:06] you, we come in an e
[3:11:14] because we are coming to his
[3:11:17] wife to his wife.
[3:11:23] You don't just
[3:11:24] come. You must be sure
[3:11:29] what you have.
[3:11:34] You come from far.
[3:11:37] You didn't just come here.
[3:11:40] You are here to hear
[3:11:44] something. Some have got some
[3:11:47] problems. Some have come with
[3:11:51] sickness. But you have got the promise
[3:11:53] here.
[3:11:56] But the time will come when the word of
[3:11:59] God is
[3:12:00] preached. People who have come with
[3:12:03] diseases those diseases will just
[3:12:06] vanish while the word is
[3:12:10] preached. Now we are here with that
[3:12:13] promise. We know that the word is
[3:12:16] coming. Whatever we
[3:12:19] have, whatever question we have is going
[3:12:22] to be answered.
[3:12:24] Whatever question we
[3:12:26] have is going to be
[3:12:29] answered. Whatever
[3:12:32] problem is going to be
[3:12:34] solved, you'll never go back with your
[3:12:42] problem. God is not God of
[3:12:47] unbelievers. Is God of
[3:12:51] believers. He has predestinated the
[3:12:55] believers for this
[3:12:58] age here. This is the meeting or the
[3:13:03] gathering of the
[3:13:06] believers. It is the gathering of the
[3:13:12] ichess. God has seen that there is a
[3:13:15] problem here.
[3:13:18] That's why he sent an
[3:13:20] echel so that the eagle must announce
[3:13:24] when it is in the air
[3:13:29] there. We are the
[3:13:32] iglers. They cannot people cannot
[3:13:34] understand
[3:13:38] us and we know they never understand
[3:13:42] us because we are ickless.
[3:13:49] And our
[3:13:50] pastors, they know when they come in
[3:13:53] front of
[3:13:55] us, they're coming in front of the
[3:13:59] ichess. The ichklas want the fresh
[3:14:06] kill. They don't want the old
[3:14:09] one. We want the fresh kill.
[3:14:13] That's why they take their
[3:14:15] time to looking for the fresh
[3:14:19] king from spoken word to another spoken
[3:14:23] worden to spoken to another spoken word
[3:14:26] to another spoken word looking for the
[3:14:29] fresh
[3:14:33] key. We don't just pick one spoken rush
[3:14:36] to the pulpit.
[3:14:46] [Music]
[3:14:48] We are fortunate
[3:14:54] people to live in this wonderful
[3:14:59] age. The age
[3:15:04] above above all dispensation.
[3:15:10] above all church
[3:15:12] ages age. That's why it is called a
[3:15:15] bright
[3:15:18] age, not the church
[3:15:21] age. The church age is
[3:15:24] over. This is the
[3:15:30] bright. The churches that outside,
[3:15:32] they're complaining.
[3:15:37] They think they they all the only right
[3:15:43] people. We also have the spirit. We also
[3:15:47] heal the
[3:15:49] disease. We also make
[3:15:55] wonders. They can't reach where we
[3:16:00] are. Far
[3:16:03] above demons cannot reach.
[3:16:08] They are yawning to reach that.
[3:16:15] Give us another song.
[3:16:23] Thank you my brother.
[3:16:26] My Lord.
[3:16:29] My Lord.

[3:41:41] until that hour
[3:41:44] arrive. So there is a six seal and the
[3:41:49] seven the seals the six
[3:41:54] seal has been open to
[3:41:57] the
[3:42:02] public. Okay. Amen. We see it and we
[3:42:07] know
[3:42:09] that this seventh
[3:42:12] seal cannot be
[3:42:14] broke to the
[3:42:19] public. Amen. Amen. Until that
[3:42:24] hour. All right. Amen. That's why uh you
[3:42:27] meet some
[3:42:29] people who will say to you, "The seventh
[3:42:32] is not revealed.
[3:42:35] And now here it
[3:42:38] says h and we know that the
[3:42:43] seventh can
[3:42:45] be be cannot be
[3:42:49] broke to the
[3:42:53] public you know. So there there is a
[3:42:56] public. You know what public
[3:42:59] is and also again I read this
[3:43:05] part. Now
[3:43:07] here that the seven
[3:43:10] seal is
[3:43:12] opened. The seven seal is not to be
[3:43:17] opened to the
[3:43:20] public. It repeats it again. Now you
[3:43:24] know what the but the public
[3:43:27] is. What's meaning by the
[3:43:32] public? Some say the seven seal is not
[3:43:36] open. Now that's the
[3:43:39] public and some believe that it is
[3:43:43] open. That is the
[3:43:45] bride. Okay. Amen. Now I read
[3:43:50] because something
[3:43:52] some here it says
[3:43:56] the New Testament
[3:44:02] [Music]
[3:44:03] uh the seventh
[3:44:05] seal
[3:44:07] closes the New Testament.
[3:44:12] That is that is he that is in you. He
[3:44:17] that is in you. Page 24. Paragraph 24.
[3:44:22] Paragraph 24. Paragraph 24.
[3:44:25] Now it says, read it for me, brother, a
[3:44:28] bit. Paragraph 24. He that is in you.
[3:44:32] Now there it is scientifically prove
[3:44:35] that it is the truth. So therefore we
[3:44:38] don't worry about whether is truth both
[3:44:41] scientifically and spiritually. And what
[3:44:44] was said come to pass. The message of
[3:44:47] the seventh the seven seals is their clo
[3:44:51] in their closing. That's the message of
[3:44:54] the entire Bible. The seven seals closes
[3:44:58] the New Testament and seal it up. That
[3:45:01] is true. Amen. Amen. The seven seal
[3:45:09] closes close what? Newestament.
[3:45:14] meaning that uh it is closed
[3:45:19] according to the prophet.
[3:45:23] All right. Amen. Now I think you are
[3:45:27] still asking for
[3:45:29] uh this uh what the prophet
[3:45:34] says in your mind.
[3:45:38] The seven the the the sixth
[3:45:42] seal has been open to
[3:45:45] us. We see
[3:45:47] it and now that the seventh
[3:45:52] seal cannot be
[3:45:55] broken to the
[3:45:59] public. So you
[3:46:02] understand that's why the public
[3:46:05] says the the seventh seal is not
[3:46:12] revealed that is not the that is the
[3:46:17] public but to the bride the bride of
[3:46:21] Christ it is open.
[3:46:26] Amen. Amen. And
[3:46:28] uh here it says
[3:46:32] the seventh seals
[3:46:36] closes the New Testament.
[3:46:41] Okay.
[3:46:44] How? Because now we have preached
[3:46:49] the seven the the the
[3:46:53] uh
[3:46:54] the seven seals.
[3:46:57] in the New
[3:46:59] Testament and sealed it
[3:47:03] up. That is true.
[3:47:08] Amen.
[3:47:09] Amen. Not that it
[3:47:13] closed to us. It is not
[3:47:16] closed the seventh
[3:47:19] seal, but to the
[3:47:22] public it is closed. Amen. Amen. Right.
[3:47:27] Amen. And that's why
[3:47:30] uh the
[3:47:32] pyramid comes
[3:47:35] in. The prophet
[3:47:38] says you are in the
[3:47:42] pyramid. Then the Lord
[3:47:44] willing will come to that. That is
[3:47:50] another
[3:47:52] revelation. M the bride is in the
[3:47:56] pyramid. Now the question is what is a
[3:48:00] pyramid?
[3:48:02] Amen. Amen. H it is not just
[3:48:10] structure.
[3:48:11] Yeah. But it it it was in the Bible
[3:48:17] here. Enoch
[3:48:22] the seventh seventh man.
[3:48:27] It tells us
[3:48:28] that he was the man
[3:48:32] responsible for this structure, the
[3:48:36] pyramid because being the
[3:48:40] seventh he was
[3:48:42] responsible for the pyramid
[3:48:45] structure and the Lord
[3:48:48] willing will come to that. It doesn't
[3:48:52] just h speak
[3:48:54] about a a building.
[3:49:00] Before you know could start the
[3:49:05] structure to build that
[3:49:07] structure. We will read to you that the
[3:49:11] he it says the
[3:49:15] material that
[3:49:18] Enoch for the
[3:49:20] pyramid he found it
[3:49:24] there ready for to build the
[3:49:29] structure and we will come and
[3:49:32] see where it
[3:49:35] says h you will see your self self
[3:49:42] in the pyramid.
[3:49:44] [Applause]
[3:49:46] Okay. Amen. Now, uh when it comes to the
[3:49:50] pyramid, there are so many things we
[3:49:52] will look at.
[3:49:55] Right. Amen. Uh even the the six that
[3:49:59] that's why it says the six seal
[3:50:04] has been opened to us.
[3:50:08] And then the seventh
[3:50:11] seal is not
[3:50:14] today
[3:50:17] public. Oh, so we
[3:50:20] understand. Then I come to this
[3:50:23] book
[3:50:25] and just for opening the
[3:50:28] way on these
[3:50:32] things you you you don't
[3:50:36] need you don't need
[3:50:39] to be a professor.
[3:50:42] No, you need to be the seed.
[3:50:47] that was planted
[3:50:51] before there was a professor.
[3:50:54] You a seed,
[3:50:57] seed of God. Amen. Amen. And
[3:51:01] now seals 574.
[3:51:07] It's it it says,
[3:51:12] "Do did I read this?" Yes, sir. Okay.
[3:51:15] Amen. All right.
[3:51:18] This
[3:51:19] pyramid as brother Brennham says you
[3:51:23] will see your
[3:51:25] time in the
[3:51:29] pyramid. Now it doesn't mean that you
[3:51:31] should go to
[3:51:33] Egypt. No. But in the
[3:51:37] pyramid this
[3:51:39] pyramid people are looking
[3:51:42] at a natural structure.
[3:51:47] But
[3:51:48] we look at it here about what the
[3:51:52] prophet says.
[3:51:54] All right. Amen. Now here and
[3:51:58] again. I think I have I I write this
[3:52:02] please part.
[3:52:04] The seven
[3:52:05] seals closes the new testament.
[3:52:11] What does that mean?
[3:52:13] Does that mean the the New Testament the
[3:52:16] the Old Testament
[3:52:20] or closes the New?
[3:52:23] Meaning the Old
[3:52:25] Testament closes the New Or the New
[3:52:29] Testament closes the New
[3:52:31] Testament closes the Old Testament.
[3:52:36] Amen. Amen. So and and sealed it up.
[3:52:44] That is true. Now we know
[3:52:49] that by the prophet utterance
[3:52:54] by
[3:52:57] scientific and and by the
[3:53:03] word. Okay. Amen. Now I come to this
[3:53:07] part
[3:53:09] also. Uh uh now the the
[3:53:17] six uh
[3:53:19] here now we find that the
[3:53:23] six has been
[3:53:28] opened. We know
[3:53:30] that seven
[3:53:33] seals cannot be broke to the public. We
[3:53:36] have seen that.
[3:53:39] And we come where it says now
[3:53:43] uh now here that the seventh
[3:53:48] seal is not open to the
[3:53:52] public and uh you know if you if you
[3:53:56] belong to a
[3:53:58] denomination that doesn't
[3:54:00] believe this things and that is the
[3:54:04] public.
[3:54:07] The prophet calls it the public.
[3:54:12] Amen. Amen. And now and he
[3:54:16] says now hear that the seventh
[3:54:20] seal is not that this is page
[3:54:24] 574 574.
[3:54:27] uh the seventh
[3:54:30] seal is not
[3:54:33] open is not to be
[3:54:36] known to the people.
[3:54:40] Now I I I believe from today if you find
[3:54:44] somebody who
[3:54:46] says h the seventh seal is not
[3:54:49] open the prophet tells you that it is
[3:54:53] not opened to the
[3:54:58] public. Amen.
[3:55:01] So six
[3:55:03] seal has been open to us. We see it and
[3:55:09] we know that
[3:55:10] This seventh seal cannot not be broke
[3:55:16] today until that
[3:55:19] hour.
[3:55:21] But then he goes to
[3:55:24] say now hear that the seventh
[3:55:28] seal is not
[3:55:30] open is not to be
[3:55:33] open or to be known to the
[3:55:37] public. Now you have the public
[3:55:40] And you have the bride. The
[3:55:43] bride. The bride do not know what the
[3:55:46] public
[3:55:48] know. It's not revealed to
[3:55:53] them. Ah. Okay. You are still going to
[3:55:57] see some other
[3:55:59] things concerning
[3:56:01] this. Now here
[3:56:04] now that the seventh
[3:56:07] seal is not to be known to the
[3:56:12] public. You can talk and talk but it is
[3:56:16] not
[3:56:17] revealed just the
[3:56:21] public. Amen. Amen. And it won't be
[3:56:25] revealed to the public.
[3:56:28] All right. Amen.
[3:56:30] M I look at something else.
[3:56:36] Oh, God bless you, sir. Amen.
[3:56:41] All
[3:56:44] right. I think we have read this part
[3:56:47] here. Yes, sir. The seventh
[3:56:51] seal
[3:56:53] closes the New Testament.
[3:56:59] Amen.
[3:57:01] That means
[3:57:03] now the message
[3:57:06] now is the seven seals.
[3:57:13] The other one is
[3:57:17] closed. Is that so?
[3:57:21] It repeats here.
[3:57:24] Uh again
[3:57:29] now here
[3:57:33] I will take this part here
[3:57:37] maybe before we can try to
[3:57:42] preach. Let me
[3:57:45] interpret him. Yeah. on the inside of
[3:57:50] that
[3:57:52] pyramid there was white
[3:57:57] stone not no writing on
[3:58:00] it that's the reason I had to go
[3:58:06] west to connect with this angel's
[3:58:11] message now when he comes to the white
[3:58:15] rock then he speaks about the
[3:58:20] angel. Now for for to meet the
[3:58:24] angel, he had to go west.
[3:58:30] Let me look at
[3:58:32] this. That's the reason I had to go
[3:58:36] [Music]
[3:58:38] west. Actually, where was the
[3:58:42] prophet? East. East.
[3:58:45] Okay. Then he had to go
[3:58:49] west. That's the reason he had to go
[3:58:53] west to connect with these
[3:58:58] angels to come back
[3:59:02] here to real to to to reveal
[3:59:07] it to the church.
[3:59:11] Now remember I said the next thing that
[3:59:16] that will
[3:59:22] happen let me read
[3:59:26] uh the next thing the reason I had to go
[3:59:31] west to connect with this angel's
[3:59:36] message to come back here to reveal
[3:59:42] to the
[3:59:45] church. I said that the next things that
[3:59:49] will
[3:59:50] happen will be here at the
[3:59:55] church. Were you
[3:59:58] there? Amen. If you are the bride of
[4:00:03] Christ, you belong to this.
[4:00:07] The prophet
[4:00:08] says a message he he came back
[4:00:13] to reveal it. To reveal it
[4:00:22] what on the
[4:00:25] inside on the
[4:00:28] inside. You know we will look at the
[4:00:32] insiders.
[4:00:35] He spoke of the
[4:00:38] insiders. All right. Amen. Like that
[4:00:44] pyramid maybe a
[4:00:47] scholar can say no it is like this or it
[4:00:50] is
[4:00:52] that but it is a scholar. But if you
[4:00:56] come to
[4:00:58] Enoch, if you come to brother
[4:01:01] Brennham, you can check it
[4:01:04] and he's a
[4:01:07] drawing
[4:01:10] drawing of his pyramid. You see the
[4:01:13] difference is that there's the out
[4:01:17] outside part of the
[4:01:20] pyramid, but he speaks of the inside.
[4:01:26] of the pyramid pyramid. So what you need
[4:01:28] is to go
[4:01:32] in then you'll see what he's talking
[4:01:34] about.
[4:01:36] Okay. Amen. Now
[4:01:40] here it says
[4:01:44] again the
[4:01:46] third
[4:01:48] came. He just says the third king came
[4:01:52] from the
[4:01:53] west and then
[4:01:56] sweeping. So
[4:01:58] and he comes to Jackson's
[4:02:04] and on the inside of that
[4:02:07] pyramid there was a white
[4:02:09] stone. On the inside.
[4:02:14] Amen. Yes. Now there was a a white
[4:02:18] stone.
[4:02:19] wasn't written
[4:02:21] on. It's just a white
[4:02:23] stone. That's the reason I had to
[4:02:28] go to connect with the angels
[4:02:32] message. I had to go
[4:02:35] west to
[4:02:37] connect w with this angel.
[4:02:41] Now, why? Now, I'm not looking for an
[4:02:45] angel. I'm looking for the message.
[4:02:50] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. That's
[4:02:53] why the first time I received the
[4:02:57] message
[4:02:58] there and I was told about the prophet,
[4:03:02] I didn't go around looking for the
[4:03:04] prophet.
[4:03:07] Amen. But I said to them,
[4:03:10] uh, please give me the
[4:03:14] books. because I I didn't I was not
[4:03:17] looking for the
[4:03:19] prophet. I was looking for the
[4:03:24] message. So because he preached the
[4:03:28] message, that's what I was looking
[4:03:31] for because the the the
[4:03:35] message is
[4:03:37] the
[4:03:39] inner h
[4:03:42] revelation. The the revelation was
[4:03:47] in the prophet just
[4:03:50] spoke revealed that
[4:03:53] message in
[4:03:55] him. So I was not looking for the uh the
[4:03:59] prophet
[4:04:01] prophet I was looking for the message
[4:04:04] for the message.
[4:04:07] All right. Amen. Even now
[4:04:10] here we know of
[4:04:14] the
[4:04:16] inner part of the
[4:04:20] pyramid. If they show me a pyramid,
[4:04:24] I will say please let me get
[4:04:30] inside. I want the inside of the
[4:04:34] pyramid.
[4:04:37] Amen. Not the
[4:04:41] structure now. And these seven seals
[4:04:50] closed New Testament. The New
[4:04:53] Testament. Oh, again. Amen. Now, yeah.
[4:04:57] He comes again.
[4:05:00] Now, the the the
[4:05:02] third he saw this
[4:05:05] flying.
[4:05:07] M what was flying
[4:05:14] flying interpretation? Oh hey yeah
[4:05:17] flying one.
[4:05:19] Have you ever seen flying fly flying
[4:05:22] interpretation?
[4:05:26] Okay. Amen. No it's so quiet for the
[4:05:30] flying.
[4:05:34] Amen. Now
[4:05:38] because seven
[4:05:43] seals closes
[4:05:45] the
[4:05:49] newest what says
[4:05:54] see okay yeah I'll come back to that now
[4:05:59] here we come
[4:06:02] uh this six sixth
[4:06:07] seal has been open to
[4:06:10] us and we know
[4:06:13] that this seventh seal, the seventh seal
[4:06:18] cannot be
[4:06:20] opened to the
[4:06:23] public. Until that
[4:06:26] hour. All right. Amen. Then it goes
[4:06:30] down. Now, yeah, until that
[4:06:35] hour, God has finished dealing with the
[4:06:40] [Music]
[4:06:43] inner, the inner part of the
[4:06:48] church. Now I come here
[4:06:52] now here that the seven
[4:06:56] seal is not to the public.
[4:07:01] not known to the
[4:07:03] public. You can go round and
[4:07:07] rounding about the
[4:07:09] ser you will be told to told that it is
[4:07:13] not revealed to the
[4:07:17] public. Then uh they'll preach to you
[4:07:20] the
[4:07:22] sixth but not the seventh.
[4:07:26] All right. Amen. Now, if you want to see
[4:07:29] the ministry or the
[4:07:33] revelation, you must look for the
[4:07:38] seventh because the six don't have it
[4:07:43] all. But if you want a a complete
[4:07:48] revelation of God, you go to the seven.
[4:07:53] Is that right?
[4:07:55] Now it
[4:08:00] says the sixth
[4:08:03] seal to it has been opened to
[4:08:07] us. We see
[4:08:10] it. This seventh
[4:08:13] seal cannot be broke to the
[4:08:17] public. Okay. Amen. I I think you are
[4:08:23] satisfied because you know
[4:08:25] now the
[4:08:28] seventh is to the
[4:08:30] bride. That's why now the six cannot
[4:08:35] preach to the
[4:08:38] seven but the
[4:08:40] seven preached to the preaches to the
[4:08:46] six. Amen. Amen. Now if you know these
[4:08:50] things, you know this the
[4:08:54] public and what the bride.
[4:09:01] All right. Amen.
[4:09:04] Now you are sitting here
[4:09:10] as the bride. the bride
[4:09:17] or amen. All right. Amen. Now, if you
[4:09:21] are the
[4:09:23] bride, now this
[4:09:25] is what I'm reading here
[4:09:28] about is your inner
[4:09:32] part. Hallelujah. If you are the the
[4:09:35] bride. But if you are not the
[4:09:37] bride, you are receiving
[4:09:40] nothing because the six
[4:09:43] part is
[4:09:45] closed. That's right. Now a Christian
[4:09:50] now who is it will tell you that we are
[4:09:55] in the pyramid.
[4:09:59] Amen. Amen. We we don't just talk about
[4:10:02] the py
[4:10:04] pyramid. It says we are in the
[4:10:08] pyramid. That is the end. Now if you
[4:10:13] find somebody who is not in the
[4:10:18] pyramid he is he he can come up to
[4:10:25] six. That's that's that's all.
[4:10:30] Okay. Amen.
[4:10:33] Now, uh we find out
[4:10:37] the
[4:10:38] six the the six
[4:10:41] seal to us. We have seen
[4:10:45] it. Then the seventh
[4:10:48] seal is not to the public.
[4:10:53] All right. Amen.
[4:10:55] Now uh if I we open the revelation
[4:11:00] here you will realize
[4:11:02] that it's only for those with the
[4:11:10] seventh h you you
[4:11:14] count to this
[4:11:17] people you come to
[4:11:19] six you'll be you'll receive amen. Amen.
[4:11:24] you go further, you come to seven. No.
[4:11:31] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[4:11:33] So, uh the six to us it has
[4:11:40] been we know it and know that the
[4:11:44] seventh is not to the public.
[4:11:50] So
[4:11:51] meeting the six
[4:11:58] uh you will start a battle
[4:12:03] you know the
[4:12:08] six when they meet it's a
[4:12:15] battle they they don't meet for the
[4:12:19] revelation. They meet for a
[4:12:24] battle. Okay. Amen. Uh we find out
[4:12:30] that the six to us it has been
[4:12:34] open but the seven cannot be open to the
[4:12:40] [Music]
[4:12:43] public. All right. Amen. How they hear
[4:12:46] that the seventh
[4:12:49] seal is not to be
[4:12:51] known to the
[4:12:58] public. Yes. And
[4:13:03] [Music]
[4:13:05] then seven when it meets seven
[4:13:11] now it's a conference conference.
[4:13:16] when they meet with a conference,
[4:13:20] but when seven meet six,
[4:13:23] it's a battle.
[4:13:26] [Applause]
[4:13:28] All right. Amen.
[4:13:30] Now
[4:13:33] uh now uh now we find that the six
[4:13:39] seal has been opened
[4:13:42] to
[4:13:45] us that mean to the
[4:13:49] seven
[4:13:51] seal. When the six meets the
[4:13:55] seven there's always a conflict.
[4:14:02] conflict because the seven
[4:14:12] cannot hear what the seven
[4:14:17] says is.
[4:14:20] Amen.
[4:14:22] But you find let let me read this now.
[4:14:28] The six se has been open to
[4:14:32] us. We see
[4:14:37] it not only opened
[4:14:40] but we
[4:14:42] see
[4:14:45] it
[4:14:47] otherwise if we don't see
[4:14:49] it will cause a
[4:14:52] battle between two. But it says we see
[4:14:55] it. And do you see it, brother? Amen.
[4:14:58] Amen. Do you see the seven? Yes, sir.
[4:15:01] Amen. All right. Amen. All right. The
[4:15:04] seven seals
[4:15:07] closes the New Testament.
[4:15:11] Okay. Amen. The
[4:15:15] seventh
[4:15:16] seal closes the seven.
[4:15:22] Now if to them it is
[4:15:25] closed that
[4:15:27] means when when the seven
[4:15:32] speaks the six don't hear
[4:15:37] anything. That's why you
[4:15:40] see pieces of
[4:15:44] churches you ask are you in the
[4:15:48] message? Yes. Thank you brother.
[4:15:52] Thanks for the service.
[4:16:02] Should you go
[4:16:04] further and say seven? They said no. No,
[4:16:08] no,
[4:16:13] no. You see, Amen. I will finish just
[4:16:17] now.
[4:16:20] And now that's why it
[4:16:23] says seven
[4:16:26] seals. Seven seals
[4:16:30] close. Let's look at these things. The
[4:16:34] seven
[4:16:35] seal closes the new
[4:16:39] testament and seal it.
[4:16:43] Now we know
[4:16:45] that by prophetic
[4:16:48] utterance and three give the witness to
[4:16:56] it. Now listen this
[4:16:59] carefully the message of the seven
[4:17:03] seals in their
[4:17:06] closing. That's the
[4:17:08] message of the
[4:17:11] entire Bible.
[4:17:15] Amen. So now the people that are in the
[4:17:19] seven
[4:17:21] uh they preach a complete
[4:17:27] message they are in the seven in the
[4:17:31] seven. So here it says the seven seals
[4:17:37] closes the new
[4:17:40] testament. All right. Amen.
[4:17:43] Seven. The whole thing is wrapped in
[4:17:47] seven. The message now the the
[4:17:51] predestinated
[4:17:53] people they are in the seven.
[4:17:58] Okay. Amen. And
[4:18:01] then
[4:18:03] uh that one
[4:18:06] seven sins
[4:18:09] the new testament. Testament s closes
[4:18:14] the new testament.
[4:18:18] It doesn't say mean you tear out the old
[4:18:23] testament. The new
[4:18:25] testament the old testament.
[4:18:28] It says h
[4:18:32] sevens closes
[4:18:35] the new
[4:18:37] testament. Amen. Now, if you buy a Bible
[4:18:42] and you find
[4:18:43] that it doesn't contain
[4:18:46] the New Testament
[4:18:49] or or the Old Testament, what are you
[4:18:52] going to
[4:18:53] do? Because we don't have half Bible.
[4:18:57] No, just one Bible.
[4:19:01] But if you don't believe
[4:19:05] the the the
[4:19:06] the prophet comes
[4:19:10] and to give light
[4:19:13] to both the old and the
[4:19:17] new and it shows you that this one
[4:19:22] closes this
[4:19:24] one. All right. Amen. Now if this one is
[4:19:29] closed now, now you are going to
[4:19:32] dwell in
[4:19:34] the in the open one. In the open
[4:19:37] one because in the open one you will
[4:19:42] receive the message of the seven
[4:19:48] sins. So there's one is
[4:19:51] opened, one is closed.
[4:19:55] Now you must make sure
[4:19:57] that you you you enter into the open one
[4:20:01] of
[4:20:05] them. All right. Amen. Because the
[4:20:09] new tell you about the old.
[4:20:14] No, but you end up if you read the old
[4:20:20] and then it will give
[4:20:22] you the
[4:20:24] interpretation of the new.
[4:20:30] Otherwise,
[4:20:32] uh you'll be
[4:20:34] walking on the other side of the Bible.
[4:20:40] All right. Amen. I come here. The seven
[4:20:44] seals
[4:20:45] the
[4:20:47] closes the new testament.
[4:20:52] That means it it it gives you complete
[4:20:56] revelation of the
[4:20:58] new and seal it up.
[4:21:01] Now we know that by
[4:21:05] prophetic by
[4:21:07] scientific we know that
[4:21:10] uh that is by prophetic
[4:21:13] utterance by
[4:21:16] scientific and by the
[4:21:18] word and then h that three give the
[4:21:24] witness to
[4:21:26] it. Okay. Amen. I think we have
[4:21:31] passed.
[4:21:34] Uh on the
[4:21:36] inside of the pyramid there was
[4:21:41] white that is page 575
[4:21:45] of the seals on the
[4:21:48] inside of the pyramid.
[4:21:52] You know pyramid is not something that
[4:21:54] you just walk
[4:21:57] around and say hey this windows are
[4:22:01] nice. You go
[4:22:05] inside will come and
[4:22:09] enter the inside of the
[4:22:13] pyramid. The seven
[4:22:15] seal not known to the
[4:22:18] public. On the inside of the
[4:22:21] pyramid, there was a white
[4:22:24] stone wasn't written
[4:22:26] on. That's the reason I had to go
[4:22:31] west to connect with the angel's
[4:22:36] message to
[4:22:39] back. You know, there was a
[4:22:42] connection of the angels, the
[4:22:46] angels. And it says here
[4:22:51] Jackson's dream
[4:22:54] that the Lord let me
[4:22:57] interpret for
[4:22:59] him. Amen. Amen. On the inside of that
[4:23:04] pyramid, there was a white
[4:23:08] stone that wasn't written on
[4:23:11] it. That's the reason I had to go west.
[4:23:18] to
[4:23:19] connect
[4:23:21] with these
[4:23:24] angels. Amen. Amen. That's the
[4:23:27] reason. Yeah. I had to go
[4:23:32] west to connect with this angel's
[4:23:38] message to come
[4:23:40] back here.
[4:23:43] That's the
[4:23:45] reason we come to the
[4:23:48] place. We have come to the
[4:23:51] place
[4:23:53] after the the seventh angel
[4:23:58] messenger has
[4:24:00] returned from the east west from west
[4:24:03] from the
[4:24:06] west. Amen. Amen. Because at the end he
[4:24:10] will tell you that east and west
[4:24:14] has met.
[4:24:18] So it
[4:24:20] says, "Junior
[4:24:22] Jackson's dream that the Lord let me
[4:24:27] interpret on the inside of that
[4:24:30] pyramid. There was white stone that
[4:24:33] wasn't written
[4:24:35] on. That's the reason I had to go
[4:24:39] west to connect with the angel's
[4:24:43] message. I had to go
[4:24:46] west to connect with this angel's
[4:24:50] message to come back here to reveal it
[4:24:55] to the church.
[4:25:00] Are you
[4:25:01] listening?
[4:25:03] So meaning
[4:25:06] that without
[4:25:08] uh the pro the seventh angel
[4:25:14] messenger you will
[4:25:17] remain without the
[4:25:21] inner I read
[4:25:23] it because you should be found in the
[4:25:29] pyramid. Amen. Amen. uh that that the
[4:25:33] seal has been open to
[4:25:36] us right now. Here it
[4:25:43] says that they will come to this mi
[4:25:47] mystery of
[4:25:52] the of the three of them
[4:25:55] three. Sorry, hold on a
[4:25:59] bit. The the um
[4:26:03] will know right around about that
[4:26:10] far the rest of
[4:26:13] it because he was talking of the of the
[4:26:18] time of the
[4:26:21] mystery of to be
[4:26:24] known. Therefore, we are this far.
[4:26:29] There was a mystery to be
[4:26:32] known now as Christians
[4:26:39] uh
[4:26:41] lives brother. Yeah, I think he's right.
[4:26:46] Uh Christian lives
[4:26:50] looking for his
[4:26:51] coming. You see what I'm looking at?
[4:26:54] Yes. Amen.
[4:26:56] Yeah.
[4:26:58] Let's just all
[4:27:02] pray
[4:27:06] straight Christian
[4:27:09] lives looking
[4:27:11] forward for
[4:27:13] his
[4:27:15] coming. Amen. All right. Amen. Now what
[4:27:20] we are looking now for is for his coming
[4:27:25] [Music]
[4:27:28] All right. Amen. But we must
[4:27:31] receive the message
[4:27:34] that will bring him
[4:27:36] here. The message for his
[4:27:39] coming. He he has sent us this message
[4:27:44] of his
[4:27:45] coming. So we should know the
[4:27:48] message of his
[4:27:50] coming. Amen. Amen. And then so you read
[4:27:55] on,
[4:27:57] pardon me a bit. Amen.
[4:28:01] Is it's not Satan. It's just
[4:28:06] Amen. Okay.
[4:28:10] I will
[4:28:12] [Music]
[4:28:15] read. Now let's just all pray.
[4:28:21] live good,
[4:28:25] straight
[4:28:27] and looking
[4:28:29] forward to
[4:28:32] his coming. Amen. You know for his
[4:28:37] coming we we have been on a journey to
[4:28:41] come to the
[4:28:43] spot where we can look for his.
[4:28:50] All right. Amen.
[4:28:53] Uh on the inside of that
[4:28:56] pyramid, there was white
[4:28:59] stone that wasn't written in. That's the
[4:29:04] reason I had to go
[4:29:06] west to connect with this angel's
[4:29:10] message to come back to reveal it to the
[4:29:15] church.
[4:29:18] He went to to
[4:29:20] connect with the angels with him. Come
[4:29:24] back now to connect with us.
[4:29:29] The
[4:29:30] bride. All right. So he connected to
[4:29:35] us the message of the seven
[4:29:41] angels. Amen. And that's the reason I
[4:29:44] had to go west.
[4:29:47] to connect with these
[4:29:50] angels and reason I had oh oh oh oh oh
[4:29:54] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[4:29:54] oh oh oh to connect to come back here
[4:29:59] to reveal it to the
[4:30:02] church now the next
[4:30:07] things that the next thing to
[4:30:12] happen is to come back here I repeat
[4:30:16] amen Amen. To reveal it to the church.
[4:30:22] So now the insight of the mystery in the
[4:30:29] pyramid
[4:30:31] revealed to the
[4:30:33] church. And let me say the people who
[4:30:38] are not part of the
[4:30:40] bride, they don't know about it.
[4:30:45] is just to worship
[4:30:48] and to say the the the prophet said this
[4:30:54] the prophet said this but they don't
[4:30:59] understand they still need somebody to
[4:31:04] interpret what the prophet has said.
[4:31:09] Amen. Amen. Now because there's the
[4:31:13] outward
[4:31:14] part and inside part of it. Now the
[4:31:20] person who has never entered the
[4:31:23] pyramid, he will wait for
[4:31:26] somebody who will come with the message
[4:31:30] in
[4:31:31] the pyramid. Now the message that we are
[4:31:35] preaching is from
[4:31:38] within. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[4:31:41] And then uh that's why it says on the
[4:31:50] inside let me see my part again now.
[4:31:54] Amen.
[4:31:56] The reason I go to west to connect with
[4:31:59] this angel's message.
[4:32:02] Now the message that you have
[4:32:05] received is from the
[4:32:08] inside of the pyramid
[4:32:11] pyramid. Now
[4:32:13] and
[4:32:16] outsiders they do not know what the
[4:32:22] insiders has received.
[4:32:27] So preaching the same
[4:32:30] thing, you find this
[4:32:32] one h inside the pyramid coming from the
[4:32:37] inside.
[4:32:39] He will preach you to
[4:32:41] you the inside
[4:32:44] [Music]
[4:32:45] mystery. Then you find another one who
[4:32:49] has never
[4:32:51] received the
[4:32:54] ministry from the inside.
[4:32:57] So that's the
[4:32:59] difference. That's why we do not agree
[4:33:03] in some
[4:33:04] things because a part is from the
[4:33:08] inside and the other part is
[4:33:11] outside. It's from the outside.
[4:33:14] Amen. H from the
[4:33:16] outside. You can
[4:33:19] say we thank God we have received the
[4:33:24] prophet but that just the outside
[4:33:29] part and you come and tell the same
[4:33:33] person about the mysteries of
[4:33:35] God brought to
[4:33:37] us by the prophet. He will say the the
[4:33:43] seventh the seventh seal is not
[4:33:48] he's
[4:33:48] [Music]
[4:33:50] also calling himself the message
[4:33:56] um believer believer. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[4:34:00] But he's got only the outside
[4:34:03] part. Once the the
[4:34:06] prophet enters the
[4:34:09] pyramid, these other
[4:34:12] believers don't know have have you have
[4:34:17] they have not
[4:34:20] received the
[4:34:22] mystery
[4:34:24] from the inside of the pyramid of the
[4:34:29] pyramid. Now you see you see these two
[4:34:32] two
[4:34:38] one is an outsider
[4:34:42] according to the prophet.
[4:34:45] Thank you. Amen.
[4:34:50] Uh they are all
[4:34:52] believers but you have the
[4:34:54] outsiders and insiders.
[4:35:00] That one also believed that God has sent
[4:35:03] the
[4:35:04] prophet but yet an
[4:35:09] outsider and the other one is an
[4:35:14] insider. Okay. Amen. Now before
[4:35:19] I finish this part
[4:35:22] here, now hear that this seven
[4:35:26] seal is not to be
[4:35:28] known to the
[4:35:32] public speaking about an
[4:35:36] outsider. All right. Amen. here. Now the
[4:35:40] seven
[4:35:42] seal cannot be broke broke to the
[4:35:46] public. Are you the public?
[4:35:50] All day you must find be found
[4:35:55] inside the real the message
[4:36:00] now
[4:36:02] inside. So you have the
[4:36:05] insiders and the outsiders.
[4:36:09] Amen. In this
[4:36:11] message that's
[4:36:12] why you you you somebody
[4:36:16] comes and uh he ask about the seven.
[4:36:22] All right. Amen. And then after
[4:36:25] that the answer
[4:36:29] is open.
[4:36:31] He goes to the
[4:36:34] inner member of the
[4:36:36] pyramid. He says it is opened.
[4:36:42] Amen. They uh they are they both
[4:36:49] uh
[4:36:51] believe the message. Believe the
[4:36:54] message. But one
[4:36:56] says the seventh is not
[4:36:59] revealed. The other one says it is
[4:37:04] revealed. But both they come to
[4:37:08] church and but yet one is an
[4:37:12] outsider and another one is an inside.
[4:37:18] Okay. Amen. Now
[4:37:21] uh let
[4:37:23] me stop
[4:37:26] here and we'll come back. I don't know
[4:37:31] we'll meet when again.
[4:37:36] I don't know when.
[4:37:38] Amen.
[4:37:40] Okay. Amen. I I'm I'm trying to pick up
[4:37:43] the last part here
[4:37:47] now. That that that the
[4:37:51] seventh is not to
[4:37:54] be
[4:37:56] known to the
[4:38:01] public. The public
[4:38:04] They
[4:38:07] oppose on things. Amen.
[4:38:11] Because the
[4:38:12] insiders uh they come with the in inside
[4:38:18] message. Inside
[4:38:22] message. Now you now you see now as I
[4:38:25] I'm closing.
[4:38:28] The
[4:38:29] outsiders don't know anything about the
[4:38:32] insiders.
[4:38:35] They they are also the
[4:38:39] believers but of the
[4:38:44] outside but the
[4:38:47] insiders they come from
[4:38:51] the
[4:38:55] innermost to to preach the innermost
[4:38:59] message.
[4:39:03] So it's
[4:39:05] different. Now on the inside of the
[4:39:08] pyramid there was white stone. That's
[4:39:12] the reason I had to
[4:39:16] go
[4:39:19] west. Uh the reason I had to go
[4:39:22] west was to
[4:39:25] connect with the angel's message.
[4:39:30] Now you see the message that we
[4:39:33] follow is from the
[4:39:37] inside. Is that right? Amen. Okay. Now
[4:39:41] in
[4:39:43] closing, we shall stand up to after
[4:39:47] reading this
[4:39:51] uh the
[4:39:53] constellation in the form of a
[4:39:57] pyramid in
[4:40:01] the
[4:40:03] con constellation
[4:40:05] constellation in the form of the
[4:40:07] pyramid.
[4:40:09] Therefore, it was in the
[4:40:12] pyramid where it it
[4:40:16] where the come brother
[4:40:20] mysterious mysterious
[4:40:24] was not
[4:40:25] written on.
[4:40:28] Okay. Now we shall

[5:01:08] Now when they heard this, they were
[5:01:10] pricricked in their heart and said unto
[5:01:13] Peter and to the rest of the apostles,
[5:01:15] "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[5:01:18] Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and
[5:01:21] be baptized, every one of you, in the
[5:01:23] name of Jesus Christ, for the remission
[5:01:26] of sins, and ye shall receive the gift
[5:01:28] of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is
[5:01:31] unto you and to your children, and to
