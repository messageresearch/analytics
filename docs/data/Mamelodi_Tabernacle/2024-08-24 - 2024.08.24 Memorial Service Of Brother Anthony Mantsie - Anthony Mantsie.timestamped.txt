[48:34] this is supposed to be an
[48:49] item he was a friend so I just wanted
[48:54] just 2 minutes something so
[49:09] I think it's 10 years
[49:12] ago it's about 10 years ago and then he
[49:15] he he joined us
[49:17] so um outside
[49:21] of in the
[49:27] stage every
[49:32] [Music]
[49:48] Sunday like your
[49:54] spirit so
[49:58] every
[50:09] Sunday maybe
[50:27] everything is
[50:39] Happ so first time
[50:42] [Music]
[51:03] every
[51:11] [Applause]
[51:24] Sunday so so
[51:29] from that point and then
[51:35] the ever learning that's
[51:42] why because nasabi he was he was he's an
[51:47] intelligent man I think given an
[51:50] opportunity he would do a lot of
[51:52] powerful
[51:53] things h
[52:16] then smartph
[52:33] every
[52:51] Sunday anyone of
[52:53] us so and then also another thing
[52:57] he was a he was willing to learn
[53:01] so upside
[53:03] down
[53:08] leftand the other way around
[53:18] [Music]
[53:29] so he was always willing willing to
[53:32] learn um and then I think another thing
[53:36] H he he he had I think he was he had he
[53:40] had a very strong faith so
[53:51] but and then sa very wor to a point
[53:55] where he was saying
[53:57] the doctor the doctor we need to
[53:59] amputate the
[54:13] leg this one I need to overcome it
[54:20] somehow yeah no no
[54:24] no a few months later
[54:45] so that's that's another thing I think
[54:47] the last
[54:48] thing maybe last two things the other
[54:50] one he had a lot of humor
[54:54] man who
[55:02] he was
[55:11] [Music]
[55:13] so the last
[55:16] thing that was very dear to his
[55:19] heart was his his
[55:23] wish he wishes his b voice can
[55:31] receive
[55:36] because the
[55:39] Imp people we are all young here there's
[55:43] a whole there's many of us the only
[55:47] thing in
[55:51] thisa
[55:53] experience and his greatest desire
[55:57] H was that his boys can somehow I know
[56:02] he tried to bring them to the church
[56:04] that is his greatest desire so wherever
[56:06] they are I hope they they they they they

[1:17:38] [Music]

[1:17:43] says chapter 1 verse1
[1:17:49] 17 uh for therein is the righteousness
[1:17:55] of God revealed from Faith to Faith as
[1:17:59] it is written the just shall live by
[1:18:18] faith let's bow our
[1:18:22] heads Heavenly Father
[1:18:26] this evening we are gathered here
[1:18:28] Lord at this memorial service of our

[1:18:50] Almighty uh having read just one verse
[1:18:54] amen believing Lord Almighty that you'll
[1:18:57] expand it and it will find Place Lord
[1:19:00] Almighty in the hearts of those that
[1:19:03] have lost their loved
[1:19:05] one and should we come to a place Lord
[1:19:08] Almighty where could we could convince
[1:19:11] them that they haven't lost him actually
[1:19:14] it's a gain Lord Almighty as Paul says

[1:19:34] prayer will reach your the target Lord
[1:19:37] Almighty and also our service Lord the
[1:19:40] seron will reach the right Target in the
[1:19:43] precious name of my Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:19:45] pray amen am you may be seated God bless
[1:19:52] you okay the scripture that we have
[1:19:58] read it says that
[1:20:01] now the righteousness of God is revealed
[1:20:06] from Faith to
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:12] Faith now before I I continue let me say
[1:20:18] that
[1:20:19] yes brother Anton was a friend of ours
[1:20:23] all
[1:20:28] uh I always call him
[1:20:33] as but I didn't know I didn't know how
[1:20:35] to pronounce that that name man or Mania
[1:20:40] somewhere
[1:20:43] there so he will always correct me and
[1:20:46] say
[1:20:51] not amen amen so yes we we loved
[1:20:56] him and then he
[1:21:00] as the speaker said
[1:21:04] here he he had a
[1:21:08] a a very good
[1:21:11] actually what I would like to speak
[1:21:13] about is just moving from Faith to
[1:21:19] Faith
[1:21:22] now to make you aware that that
[1:21:27] actually the
[1:21:30] eyes
[1:21:32] are just a
[1:21:36] screen they they cannot
[1:21:41] interpret the inner man is the one that
[1:21:44] has got an
[1:21:47] interpretation so
[1:21:50] uh that is
[1:21:53] why he was so
[1:21:56] blessed because he was living through
[1:22:00] the inner
[1:22:03] man he was not depending on the
[1:22:08] eyes he was depending on the main
[1:22:14] thing firstly you know we have inner
[1:22:20] senses I heard Pastor M saying we've got
[1:22:25] doctor
[1:22:28] here he will side with
[1:22:31] me that we've got five inner
[1:22:38] senses and
[1:22:40] then that's what Anon was
[1:22:45] using we we have
[1:22:49] memory then that is why we we have so
[1:22:54] many Believers which are more than a or
[1:23:01] 3,000 but he could memorize each and
[1:23:04] everyone's
[1:23:08] voice he was not going to ask you who
[1:23:11] are
[1:23:12] you if if I call
[1:23:15] him and say uh how are
[1:23:21] you he's going to say uh
[1:23:30] so he he memorized my
[1:23:34] voice not that he sat down and scratched
[1:23:37] his
[1:23:38] head no automatically once you speak to
[1:23:42] him and tell him your name he you are
[1:23:45] already registered in his
[1:23:52] memory and then he
[1:23:55] he he could also reason those part part
[1:23:58] of the the inner senses could
[1:24:02] reason as you all know he had also
[1:24:05] imagination he could imagine
[1:24:09] things
[1:24:11] right and on and on conscious you know
[1:24:14] those an affection had all those
[1:24:18] things but now to me as this young man
[1:24:22] was saying here he was very
[1:24:29] interesting he said to
[1:24:35] me I started knowing that I am a blind
[1:24:43] man when they took me to a blind
[1:24:47] school but before
[1:24:50] that I was wondering why they always pit
[1:24:54] me
[1:24:56] home say no why do you write a
[1:25:01] donkey why do you CL a
[1:25:04] tree you know that you you can't see you
[1:25:08] must write it
[1:25:11] donkey to me it was just a normal life I
[1:25:14] would play with some other
[1:25:17] kids I ride a
[1:25:20] donkey and then one thing that surprised
[1:25:24] me
[1:25:26] he
[1:25:29] said he said to me do you know that I'm
[1:25:31] from the initiation
[1:25:37] school so that's part of the things that
[1:25:40] it really surprised
[1:25:43] me so now but some other people might
[1:25:47] say what okay let's go to the word of
[1:25:51] God I'm I'm giv 30 minutes or 45
[1:25:56] years let's talk about this
[1:25:58] thing the Bible
[1:26:02] says
[1:26:03] uh God's
[1:26:07] righteousness is revealed from Faith to
[1:26:14] Faith now uh if you
[1:26:18] read the book of
[1:26:21] Romans chapter 1
[1:26:24] 11 here we
[1:26:28] are in the 11th verse the Bible
[1:26:33] says uh no chapter 8 not one chapter
[1:26:40] 8 11th verse can you read it my
[1:26:47] brother okay in English it says but if
[1:26:50] the spirit of him that rais up Jesus
[1:26:55] from the dead dwell in
[1:26:58] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:27:02] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:27:06] bodies
[1:27:19] by you hear what it says it's by his
[1:27:22] spirit that dwelle in
[1:27:27] you it will Quicken your your
[1:27:33] bodies so when when when somebody has
[1:27:37] passed
[1:27:39] on he's not
[1:27:43] dead he's
[1:27:46] asleep and then uh we who are alive
[1:27:50] that's what the Bible
[1:27:52] says we will not prevent
[1:27:55] them that are
[1:27:59] asleep
[1:28:01] see but now the thing that will Quicken
[1:28:06] the their
[1:28:10] bodies is a is a certain
[1:28:13] spirit that will be given to certain
[1:28:18] people not everybody will resurrect
[1:28:24] the one that will
[1:28:26] resurrect is the one as the Bible
[1:28:31] says that has the
[1:28:34] spirit it says okay let me read it all
[1:28:37] but if the spirit of him that raise up
[1:28:41] Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:28:47] you there should a spirit there should
[1:28:50] be a
[1:28:52] spirit that should dwell in
[1:28:55] you and then that spirit will raise
[1:28:59] you now if you can
[1:29:03] depart without that
[1:29:06] Spirit you cannot
[1:29:10] resurrect are we
[1:29:12] together the spirit that raised our Lord
[1:29:17] Jesus
[1:29:19] Christ should dwell in
[1:29:22] you you should ask yourself this
[1:29:25] question have you got that
[1:29:28] spirit and what kind of spirit is
[1:29:32] that and where can I get that
[1:29:36] spirit that raised
[1:29:40] Jesus and then he says there it must
[1:29:43] dwell in
[1:29:46] you
[1:29:48] right okay fine am now when you repent
[1:29:55] you repent by
[1:29:58] faith right amen they you are told by go
[1:30:02] I me we told about
[1:30:05] God which you don't know you know your
[1:30:10] ancestors you don't know about God and
[1:30:13] somebody
[1:30:14] comes and take a
[1:30:17] book this black book some called it is
[1:30:20] for the white
[1:30:22] man so he comes with a white man
[1:30:26] book and introduce God to
[1:30:31] you and then whatever is going to tell
[1:30:36] you it will be a push and be a surprise
[1:30:40] to
[1:30:44] you until you receive
[1:30:46] it now he will tell you about
[1:30:50] heaven he will tell you about the
[1:30:52] changing of your body
[1:30:54] it will tell you lot of
[1:30:57] things you wouldn't know whether to
[1:30:59] receive it or not
[1:31:02] receive but now when you receive it
[1:31:05] that's what we call
[1:31:07] Faith says faith cometh by
[1:31:11] hearing what do you hear you hear the
[1:31:15] word of
[1:31:16] God now so many people are talking about
[1:31:20] the word of God and are preaching the
[1:31:23] word of God
[1:31:25] until you get
[1:31:26] confused now which
[1:31:29] one is the right
[1:31:31] spirit that can Quicken my
[1:31:35] body and why do you say this is the
[1:31:38] right
[1:31:42] spirit I will I will tell
[1:31:44] you the
[1:31:46] Pharisees
[1:31:48] thees and the scribes were waiting for
[1:31:52] the Messiah
[1:31:54] for many
[1:31:55] years
[1:31:57] Isaiah prophesied and said a virgin
[1:32:01] shall
[1:32:02] conceive and bear a
[1:32:05] son it didn't say
[1:32:08] Maria says a virgin shall
[1:32:13] conceive and then when Maria
[1:32:16] conceived one can say the Bible didn't
[1:32:19] say
[1:32:21] Mar right amen and the Bible
[1:32:25] says a voice crying in the
[1:32:30] wilderness for running the
[1:32:33] Messiah in other words there will be a
[1:32:36] voice that will point the
[1:32:40] Messiah it didn't say
[1:32:42] John the Baptist it says a
[1:32:47] voice and when John comes they're going
[1:32:51] to say to him he didn't say you
[1:32:54] says the
[1:32:56] voice are we together God should bear a
[1:33:02] witness that
[1:33:04] John is the
[1:33:07] Forerunner but if John says he a
[1:33:10] forun without God bearing a
[1:33:14] witness be John saying
[1:33:17] that so they were waiting for the
[1:33:20] Messiah we are waiting for the changing
[1:33:22] our
[1:33:25] everybody here is waiting for the second
[1:33:28] coming of
[1:33:29] Christ changing of this
[1:33:32] body now how is this body going to
[1:33:35] change how did they see the
[1:33:38] Messiah John pointed him and said
[1:33:43] there's the Lamb of
[1:33:44] God and then people will say that is his
[1:33:49] cousin John and
[1:33:51] Jesus were cousins their mothers were
[1:33:56] cousins now when he point him and say
[1:33:59] this is the Lamb of
[1:34:01] God very few
[1:34:04] people understood that that is why they
[1:34:08] look at
[1:34:10] Christ and look at John look at Christ
[1:34:14] and look at John and follow
[1:34:17] John John was
[1:34:19] saying that is the Messiah we are
[1:34:21] waiting
[1:34:22] for but they could not understand that
[1:34:25] they followed
[1:34:30] John
[1:34:32] until John was
[1:34:35] arrested and while he was in prison he
[1:34:38] sent them again and
[1:34:42] said H I understand or they came to him
[1:34:46] and said that man you
[1:34:48] pointed he started his own church he
[1:34:52] baptizing people
[1:34:55] Jesus
[1:34:56] said go and ask
[1:34:59] him whether he's the
[1:35:02] Messiah and then they went to him and
[1:35:07] say are you the
[1:35:10] Messiah he didn't say yes I'm a
[1:35:13] messiah neither did he say no I'm not
[1:35:16] the
[1:35:17] Messiah then he said to
[1:35:21] them John
[1:35:24] preached that other side of of
[1:35:27] Jordan and baptized people you were
[1:35:32] there and
[1:35:34] then where did you go there to
[1:35:39] see were you seeing a re blown by a
[1:35:44] wind not
[1:35:46] John in all
[1:35:48] prophets a born of woman there's no one
[1:35:52] like John
[1:35:55] amen did they get an
[1:35:57] answer no he didn't say yes I'm the
[1:36:02] mess oh no I'm not the he pointed them
[1:36:06] to
[1:36:07] John because John was the
[1:36:11] for now
[1:36:13] if they didn't believe that John is a
[1:36:17] messiah I mean John is the
[1:36:19] forun they wouldn't see the Messiah
[1:36:23] yeah in order that they should the
[1:36:25] Messiah they should see the Messiah must
[1:36:28] believe that John is
[1:36:31] the the Bible says
[1:36:34] behold I will send you Eliah the prophet
[1:36:40] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[1:36:44] Lord and He will
[1:36:46] turn heart of the fathers to their
[1:36:51] children that's Mal
[1:36:55] turn the heart of
[1:36:57] their fathers to the children the
[1:37:02] fathers had the doctrine of
[1:37:05] Moses they will never believe
[1:37:08] anybody when John comes with a Ministry
[1:37:12] that the ministry now is
[1:37:15] changing changing the heart of the
[1:37:18] father to the recent
[1:37:22] Ministry couldn't believe
[1:37:25] it and in our time the Bible says
[1:37:30] behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:37:34] prophet before the great and Dreadful
[1:37:38] day now that Prophet will turn the
[1:37:42] hearts of the
[1:37:44] children to their
[1:37:46] fathers not fathers to the
[1:37:49] children but to the the children
[1:37:53] fathers who is our
[1:37:57] fathers Paul
[1:38:03] said I have exped you that's what he
[1:38:07] said exposed
[1:38:12] you in other words when he says and you
[1:38:14] he given you a man that could marry
[1:38:19] you then when you are married you are
[1:38:23] the
[1:38:24] bride in the time that you are living in
[1:38:27] there's a church in the
[1:38:30] bride
[1:38:33] now said when he
[1:38:40] met after the service he said no I don't
[1:38:44] think that I will
[1:38:46] sleep heard some things that I didn't
[1:38:51] know what were those things
[1:38:54] those things was the changing of the
[1:38:56] ministry we call them
[1:39:00] dispensation now what is a
[1:39:03] dispensation this is just
[1:39:06] listen
[1:39:08] Moses was told to take the children of
[1:39:12] Israel out of
[1:39:16] Egypt then he went and said to
[1:39:20] far let my people go
[1:39:24] and they and the far released
[1:39:27] them now when he was in
[1:39:30] Egypt he was preaching a
[1:39:33] Ministry Let My People Go no other
[1:39:37] Ministry until they went out and crossed
[1:39:41] the Red
[1:39:42] Sea after crossing the Red Sea he cannot
[1:39:46] say Let My People
[1:39:48] Go they
[1:39:50] out now they're in the desert now change
[1:39:53] the ministry
[1:39:55] now that is another
[1:39:58] dispensation now we speak about Mana
[1:40:00] that comes
[1:40:01] from speak about the
[1:40:03] rock are we together now the ministry is
[1:40:07] changing it's another
[1:40:10] dispensation when they
[1:40:12] reach
[1:40:15] Kish the River
[1:40:17] Jordan God showed
[1:40:20] him and God show him the the Promised
[1:40:23] Land
[1:40:25] that was the end of his ministry Joshua
[1:40:28] took over now now his ministry was to
[1:40:32] let them cross
[1:40:36] over he cannot speak about
[1:40:39] mana on the Rock no you talk about
[1:40:43] crossing
[1:40:44] over and after crossing over they reach
[1:40:47] the promised land and they receive now
[1:40:51] their inheritance
[1:40:54] amen
[1:40:55] now we talk about being born
[1:41:00] again receive Christ as your
[1:41:03] savior which is
[1:41:05] good and after receiving
[1:41:09] Christ what
[1:41:13] then you need
[1:41:15] now a
[1:41:18] Ministry that will impact life in you
[1:41:23] now the imparted
[1:41:25] life is what we call the word of
[1:41:29] God let's read John chapter
[1:41:34] 6 John chapter 6
[1:41:39] verse why are we here when when when
[1:41:43] when our brother
[1:41:46] depart we should know exactly where he
[1:41:51] went we should not we should not uh
[1:41:57] probe now we should know
[1:42:00] where right amen now now verse 61 says
[1:42:07] verse 61 John chapter 6 it
[1:42:11] says when Jesus knew in himself that his
[1:42:15] disciples mmed at it he said unto them
[1:42:20] does this offend you and then verse 62
[1:42:25] that's the one I word what and if you
[1:42:29] shall see the son of men Ascend up where
[1:42:35] he was before
[1:42:54] what if you shall see the son of man
[1:42:58] Ascend up where he was
[1:43:04] before now it's Jesus that ask them and
[1:43:08] then he calls himself son of man say
[1:43:11] what are you going to say if you see
[1:43:13] this son of man in other words you see
[1:43:16] myself Ascend to where I was
[1:43:20] before now the Bible says we were in
[1:43:26] Christ we were in his
[1:43:29] mind before the foundation
[1:43:32] of so where do we come from we come from
[1:43:35] him and when we go where do we go go to
[1:43:39] him not everybody goes
[1:43:42] there it's
[1:43:45] predestination now if it says
[1:43:48] predestination it means your destination
[1:43:50] has been prepared
[1:43:56] are we together you cannot go to a place
[1:43:59] that you don't
[1:44:02] know you come from God and you go back
[1:44:06] to God that's why you don't
[1:44:09] die because you've got a spirit of
[1:44:13] Resurrection you've got a quickening
[1:44:15] spirit you've got a
[1:44:18] spirit that
[1:44:20] will come and collect your
[1:44:25] soul and collect your
[1:44:27] body and resurrect you've got quickening
[1:44:32] spirit and you've got another Qui
[1:44:35] Spirit those that
[1:44:37] that that the Bible says we who are
[1:44:41] alive shall not prevent those that are
[1:44:44] sleep they slept with a quickening
[1:44:48] spirit we are here also we've got a
[1:44:51] quickening spirit
[1:44:54] are we together amen now the quickening
[1:44:56] spirit I'm talking about I'm talking
[1:44:59] about the spirit that will change
[1:45:05] this Flesh and
[1:45:07] Blood shall not
[1:45:09] inherit the kingdom of God are we
[1:45:13] together this flesh
[1:45:16] ofana is not needed in
[1:45:19] heaven I always say you cannot find the
[1:45:23] in heaven neither could you find a
[1:45:27] in neither can you find an English man
[1:45:31] in are we are we together so now this
[1:45:35] body have to go
[1:45:37] down so now when
[1:45:40] somebody
[1:45:42] depart we are not say this body is
[1:45:46] departing we talk about his
[1:45:49] Spirit we talk about his soul
[1:45:54] Abraham Abraham
[1:45:58] Isaac
[1:46:00] Jacob they all
[1:46:03] departed but when our Lord Jesus
[1:46:07] Christ died he went to
[1:46:12] Paradise
[1:46:14] because they could not go further than
[1:46:17] that because of the blood of the oxen
[1:46:23] animal
[1:46:26] blood it could
[1:46:28] not take them
[1:46:30] further that's why he had to
[1:46:33] die and his blood was the
[1:46:37] one that that's that's the only blood
[1:46:41] that can take them
[1:46:44] further that's why he went there and
[1:46:47] took them up you read it in in in in the
[1:46:51] Book of Psalms
[1:46:53] or should we read
[1:46:56] it chapter 7 verse
[1:47:04] 24 so now we are here trying to when
[1:47:09] when we say uh uh you are some somebody
[1:47:13] has
[1:47:15] departed and the people I mean his
[1:47:20] relatives his friends
[1:47:23] where uh
[1:47:28] uh they
[1:47:31] they they are
[1:47:34] grieved so the only way of consoling
[1:47:40] them is to go to the
[1:47:45] Bible
[1:47:47] and point them where is their relative
[1:47:54] and where where are
[1:47:57] they now here I'm talking about Psalm
[1:48:03] 24 verse
[1:48:06] S the Bible says
[1:48:08] yes uh after our Lord Jesus
[1:48:13] Christ uh
[1:48:15] died or he became now a
[1:48:20] redeemer he started now
[1:48:24] redeeming because before he could
[1:48:28] die he was not a
[1:48:30] redeemer he was not a
[1:48:34] mediator he became a
[1:48:37] mediator through his
[1:48:40] blood and the Holy
[1:48:42] Ghost uh I mean the the disciples went
[1:48:47] and went and wait for the Holy Ghost
[1:48:50] after he has died
[1:48:53] then he became the mediator now now his
[1:48:56] blood
[1:48:58] now you see so now he went to
[1:49:02] paradise and took Isaac I mean took
[1:49:08] Abraham Isaac Jacob and everybody that
[1:49:13] is in
[1:49:14] paradise and took them now to another
[1:49:18] level listen what he says as he arrived
[1:49:22] now where he was toing was taking
[1:49:25] them he said lift up your heads or ye
[1:49:29] gates now when it says lift up your
[1:49:36] heads or ye gates which means he was
[1:49:40] getting into the
[1:49:41] gate and the gates were closed so he
[1:49:44] says open
[1:49:46] up I am bringing these
[1:49:49] Believers that's why he says lift up
[1:49:51] your heads
[1:49:55] Gates and you be lifted
[1:49:58] up ye Everlasting
[1:50:01] doors and the king of glory shall come
[1:50:06] in can we hear it in our
[1:50:23] you see now he's bringing
[1:50:27] them to another
[1:50:30] level look if we have this body here on
[1:50:36] Earth which we call it a terrestrial
[1:50:39] body and when we
[1:50:42] depart we get into another
[1:50:45] body which is a Celestial
[1:50:49] Bo you're going to wait in that Bo
[1:50:52] yeah
[1:50:54] now there's two places of
[1:50:58] waiting some are waiting for the the the
[1:51:05] resurrection some will be waiting for
[1:51:08] judgment now if you
[1:51:11] sleep
[1:51:13] without the resurrection
[1:51:16] speed then you're going to resurrect
[1:51:19] when when you go to the judgment
[1:51:23] amen amen right but if you
[1:51:26] sleep with a spirit with a quickening
[1:51:29] spirit we are not going to any judgment
[1:51:32] according to the word of God you are
[1:51:35] going to sit on the
[1:51:38] throne with a
[1:51:40] groom and
[1:51:43] judge are we together so now we need to
[1:51:47] have that what you that that
[1:51:50] understanding that we are here on
[1:51:54] all of us the word of God is preached
[1:51:58] some reject it some receive
[1:52:01] it we've got three kinds of Believers on
[1:52:04] this some believe the word of God some
[1:52:09] they they in
[1:52:11] between we call them make
[1:52:14] Believers some don't believe the way
[1:52:17] there's nothing that you could do it's
[1:52:20] like that some will not believe
[1:52:24] it some will be make
[1:52:26] Believers some will believe it when John
[1:52:31] came some could not believe it some
[1:52:34] believe it when our Lord Jesus
[1:52:36] Christ some did not believe it some
[1:52:40] believe it some will make
[1:52:42] believers they were
[1:52:45] divided and even today it's like that
[1:52:49] are we together now you don't believe
[1:52:53] the word of God because you are
[1:52:56] intelligent
[1:52:58] no the Bible
[1:53:00] says it's God that calls
[1:53:04] you he says he he says all those that
[1:53:08] the father gave
[1:53:10] me there's not even a single
[1:53:13] one that will come out of
[1:53:16] my and and he knows them he says my
[1:53:20] sheep knows my voice
[1:53:24] they could hear that
[1:53:26] voice master's
[1:53:28] voice and he will give you the right
[1:53:31] place and you'll know what to do
[1:53:35] without
[1:53:37] look
[1:53:39] God cannot
[1:53:41] change or cannot
[1:53:44] Rapture
[1:53:46] anybody that is not that is not like
[1:53:50] him the word of god is perfect and the
[1:53:55] word of God will make you
[1:53:58] perfect now when you are perfect God
[1:54:02] will go for
[1:54:04] Perfection the Bible says be ye
[1:54:07] therefore
[1:54:08] perfect as your father in Heaven
[1:54:12] isect now God will give you a perfect
[1:54:15] weight and he will give you a word that
[1:54:18] will make you
[1:54:20] perfect you know Jesus Jus said I and my
[1:54:26] father are
[1:54:29] one and then what happened you read it
[1:54:31] in in John uh 10:30 says I and my father
[1:54:37] are and then now they said to him he
[1:54:42] said to to
[1:54:44] them what is my sin just show me one
[1:54:50] thing that you want me you want to kill
[1:54:53] me
[1:54:54] for they said to him you've done lot of
[1:54:58] great
[1:54:59] things wonderful things you walk upon
[1:55:03] the sea you raise the dead you multiply
[1:55:07] bread we are so thankful for but our
[1:55:12] problem with you you are a man you make
[1:55:17] yourself now let me tell you that's
[1:55:19] that's where the mystery is
[1:55:22] God must
[1:55:25] come and receive another
[1:55:29] God if you read in the book of uh John
[1:55:33] Chapter
[1:55:37] 30 verse
[1:55:41] 35 it says you are
[1:55:46] God the word of
[1:55:48] God makes you God
[1:55:53] and then when God comes he will come and
[1:55:56] receive
[1:55:59] God are we together so now unless the
[1:56:03] word of
[1:56:05] God which is the seed of God which
[1:56:09] germinates when it comes to you it make
[1:56:13] another
[1:56:14] person the supernatural
[1:56:17] one you are a physical man but the word
[1:56:20] of God forms another person in
[1:56:25] you amen and that word of God and that
[1:56:30] body that it
[1:56:31] forms that's the one God will come and
[1:56:36] Rapture that is why here it says Bible
[1:56:39] what would you say when you see the son
[1:56:44] of man goes back where he was before
[1:56:48] where was the son of man he was in the
[1:56:51] bosom of the father
[1:56:53] no one who has ever seen
[1:56:55] God except the
[1:56:59] son because the sun is in the bosom
[1:57:02] of so now in consoling
[1:57:06] you the
[1:57:08] family is that now your
[1:57:12] brother or your loved
[1:57:15] one he not in bondage wherever he
[1:57:19] is no he's in is in a better
[1:57:24] place he received the
[1:57:27] word that word forms him remember the
[1:57:31] man that is standing before you now you
[1:57:36] callana actually the real man is the one
[1:57:39] that is
[1:57:40] inside this one is
[1:57:45] aging he got Silver Lining you
[1:57:49] see he cannot go to heaven
[1:57:53] are we together so we've got elderly
[1:57:56] people
[1:57:57] here elderly fathers elderly mothers you
[1:58:01] cannot find a go go in
[1:58:06] heaven or an old man a very sick man in
[1:58:12] heaven it's just now that the inner part
[1:58:15] the inner
[1:58:16] man is not a is not an old man
[1:58:22] are we
[1:58:24] together so now in
[1:58:26] closing
[1:58:28] because I was giv this 45 minutes I'm
[1:58:31] left with 2 minutes in
[1:58:34] closing is this that now I quoted the
[1:58:38] scripture and left
[1:58:40] it you need to
[1:58:43] know where the place of worship
[1:58:48] is Right amen
[1:58:52] you missed the place of
[1:58:54] worship you God sent John the
[1:58:59] Baptist and they left everybody and
[1:59:02] followed John the
[1:59:04] bapti and when the ministry
[1:59:06] changes John the Baptist appointed
[1:59:10] Christ they left
[1:59:12] Christ I mean they left
[1:59:15] John and those that followed
[1:59:17] Christ he didn't preach to them no no he
[1:59:22] just said follow
[1:59:25] me and Peter followed
[1:59:29] him uh the sons of
[1:59:32] zebede they were with their father he
[1:59:35] just said follow me they left their
[1:59:37] father and
[1:59:39] follow because now a deep call it unto a
[1:59:44] deep he was not calling the the physical
[1:59:48] men he was calling the men inside
[1:59:54] there is somebody inside of
[1:59:57] you either he comes from
[1:59:59] eternity look the Bible
[2:00:02] says the
[2:00:05] angels that kept not their first
[2:00:11] estate God has changed
[2:00:16] them prepared a lake of
[2:00:20] fire those are the Angels
[2:00:23] that kept not their
[2:00:25] FA and the people that could not keep
[2:00:30] their first
[2:00:33] AC God created you for what reason why
[2:00:38] did God create you so that you should
[2:00:40] serve
[2:00:43] him right amen and in serving him then
[2:00:47] he becomes
[2:00:48] happy and if you don't serve him then
[2:00:52] God doesn't know
[2:00:56] you he doesn't know you because you
[2:00:58] don't know
[2:01:00] him you don't know each other but if you
[2:01:03] know that this is my God you surrender
[2:01:07] yourself and when you surrender yourself
[2:01:11] then you are baptized in his name and
[2:01:13] then when you baptized in his when the
[2:01:16] word of God
[2:01:17] preaches finds a place in
[2:01:20] your one verse one verse one verse John
[2:01:29] 8 verse 37
[2:01:39] amen amen may you please read it for us
[2:01:41] in Sp so that everyone can hear
[2:01:44] it all right John 8 verse 37
[2:02:08] I know that you are Abraham's
[2:02:14] seed but you seek to kill
[2:02:17] me because my
[2:02:20] word had no
[2:02:23] in you look the word of
[2:02:29] God the word had no place in
[2:02:38] you
[2:02:41] amen
[2:02:43] amen so that it can word must find place
[2:02:47] in
[2:02:49] you and then when the word
[2:02:52] comes and dwell in you what does it do
[2:02:55] to
[2:02:57] you that's where now it
[2:03:01] germinates when this word
[2:03:04] germinates it's that
[2:03:07] Spirit which we call a quickening
[2:03:18] spirit First Corinthians
[2:03:22] chapter
[2:03:23] 15:45 when the word comes into
[2:03:26] you it finds a place and it
[2:03:29] relax you don't have to
[2:03:32] struggle no the word
[2:03:34] itself do the
[2:03:37] word but if it can't find Place want to
[2:03:43] suffer read it read it verse verse 45
[2:03:48] 1545 First Corinthians all right 1
[2:03:52] Corinthians chter 15 ver
[2:04:03] 45 the
[2:04:06] last is the quickening
[2:04:09] spirit who is the last
[2:04:11] Adam it's
[2:04:14] Christ Christ is a quickening
[2:04:17] spirit that
[2:04:20] person that germinates in you it's
[2:04:24] called Christ so when Christ comes he
[2:04:27] come and and and what you call and and
[2:04:30] take
[2:04:32] Christ what we call a
[2:04:34] Rapture maybe some other people says
[2:04:36] what is this
[2:04:38] Rapture I'm closing the Rapture is
[2:04:41] this you are
[2:04:44] all
[2:04:45] waiting for the coming of the
[2:04:48] Lord Coming For What
[2:04:52] to come and fetch
[2:04:54] you
[2:04:57] right come and fetch
[2:05:00] you so
[2:05:02] now the Bible says you're are going to
[2:05:05] meet him in the
[2:05:07] sky not here in other ways you must
[2:05:11] change and go up to the
[2:05:14] sky you don't become a
[2:05:17] bed no you are yourself you become
[2:05:20] Christ Christ will be
