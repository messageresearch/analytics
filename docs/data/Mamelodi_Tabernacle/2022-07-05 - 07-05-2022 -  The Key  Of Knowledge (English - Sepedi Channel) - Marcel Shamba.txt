tonight let's give him a better hand of appreciation let's welcome his presence our lord is so good and so wonderful he has done so much for us he has done so much that we don't have enough in our language to express what the lord has done we come in his presence with thanksgivings with praises with appreciation and we say blessed be the name of the lord for the lord is good and reign forever amen let's give him another hand the bible says in the book of psalm 11617 verse i will offer to thee the sacrifice of my thanksgiving and we'll call upon the name of the lord amen as the bible say count what the lord has done there are so many things that the lord has done in our lives we owe him our time we owe him all that we are for him our lives and there is nothing that we can hold away from our god because he deserves the best of us we are here in his presence i trust that we are under expectation and i know the expectation of our heart will bring a good atmosphere and the atmosphere will take god into action and if somebody came expecting something from the lord he will leave this place satisfied you know there is one thing about our god he has never disappointed us he always keeps his appointment he always come on time and when he come he does great things amen tonight we have just arranged this service for you to be blessed and we know that we are indeed going to be blessed we blessed we appreciate the effort of everyone for being here on time the technical team the musician i believe that though it was a short notice for some but everyone managed to make it because you can delay when they tell you you are going to be blessed you know there is something that we understand that in god's presence we receive our heart desires satisfied now tonight it's a special service we've got serious men of god here that are going to bless us you know god does not give you things by force god depends on your availability if you can avail yourself tonight god is going to bless you we are going to have master freddie tonight again i believe he's not somebody to introduce here everyone knows him he has been a great blessing for us the past few weeks he has been ministering here and the lord has blessed us in a special way and i believe he deserves a hand of appreciation to welcome him tonight i think you will come and intervene as the second speaker we are going to have two speakers tonight we've got also another of our friends a wonderful man of god pastor shamba myself who has come from lubumbashi he has also been a great blessing for us the past week a wonderful man of god with a very good spirit he has offered us a wonderful time in his church when we visited him last year and he showed so many good things and we also thought it's going to be a blessing for this church to have him and after blessing us here we went to meet our elder pastor godima and spoke to him and thought that what if we extend the blessing and the blessings to all of us it's going to be helpful for the church of the living god i trust that that's the reason why some of you are also here tonight to just bring more fire to the blessings that we are being given here by the lord and i believe that our hearts are going to get prepared now as we'll be inviting now the ministers to the pulpit i think we will start with pastor marcel tonight and then he will come and say something to introduce pastor freddy then after him we will just have a break for tonight then we'll come back here tomorrow and i believe we will have pastor kojima for both services tomorrow morning and in the afternoon so tomorrow in the morning pastor freddy will be preaching in uval for pastor jewell i believe that we are going to arrange that for him because the president they are requested also and pastor shamba is going to be in rosetonville to pasta allen and then in the evening we will come back here all of us they will join us for the evening service i trust that you have prepared this moment you have been prayed up and you have arranged your heart and you know the minister the revival is not in the preacher the revival is in the people the more the people pull and that's how god puts more in the heart of the minister so i will invite you to stand on your feet as you're going to be inviting pastor shamba to come to the pulpit for the first uh session of tonight is going to help us introduce the pastor freddie afterwards you [Music] thank you [Music] every day [Music] how many believe he what he has is yesterday he's able to do it today as well hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] every day [Music] roughly [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] right [Music] oh [Music] amen can we just give god a hand of appreciation i believe now we can get ourselves ready for the world let's just say he keeps on doing great things as we going to now give the place to the minister to start blessing our hearts amen are we now ready for the word amen let's say he keeps on doing great things as we're going to invite the pastor in the prophet [Music] in a special way [Music] oh [Music] [Music] may the lord almighty bless you tonight i believe you are happy tonight we are gathering together tonight we believe the blessings are already here and god is already our answer tonight even whatever things or whatever let us i will be among so we don't have a new message to bring to you let us go to the book of luke i'm just going to read verse 10. look 16 from 10 and then i'm going to add azaya isaiah 30 verse 18. let us start from luke 10 look 16. he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in march he that is unjust in the list is unjust also in march is [Music] foreign isaiah 30 from verse 18 let us read it says and therefore will the lord wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you for the lord is a god of judgment blessed are all day that wait for him let us pray [Music] we have the first color which is red it is upon faithfulness that the faith of israel is blessed because when someone is faithful even in the list they shall be faithful even in march when you say that you accept something you must prove that you do really accept it that is why god looked upon this law would you see a church but because she lost one egg without getting a little tea and there was a farmer that took that egg and put it in the in the bunnies she lost an egg and that must be found somewhere but one time and she she made a shout out there is a diff that caught up to it and that little ego that small ego in yani the mother called her from the heavens but the the mama eagle did not land to where that small ego was [Music] she said the voice that you are hearing when you have rejected the word you haven't rejected the word at all we cannot find someone who's in both sides there is strength you cannot faithful it's like she went in the forest with the little ones and they found themselves around honey the mama yes god is going to do things amen you must show that you want it when i'm behind my pastor he needs to know that this believer loves me when in the message only provided place of fellowship i need to watch so i can i can i can check my time sometimes we seem to forget that it's not the bigger things the strength of the chain is measured according to the link the the weakest link okay because they will have the right to enter into we are not things you love oh the bigger ones it is the life of a believer that is why israel israel israel israel in the flag there is blue why is that because they are faithful towards god even though they can go wherever they will remember the god of abraham the god of abraham abraham that's faithfulness whatever to protect them and when you go to america america they've got their own currency and you you are english-speaking people there is a writing on the top of the note written on the note it says in god we trust god we trust he's telling us that the americans even you're going through tough times they're still going to show that they love god the devil catches you when you become when you become undecided let us go yes one day god shall pay them back god is going to pay those people back god will reward them god is keeps his words faithful even though is it takes you to the valley first so when you are down during the valley the only moment it is not god has forsaken you it is not god's forsaking you even when i'm on top of the mountains even jesus christ [Music] foreign me my power and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth but thou shalt remember the lord i god for it is it is he that giveth thee power to get love that he may establish his covenant which he swear unto thy fathers as it is this day speak to your soul it is not your strength even [Music] it is not to god he says and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord thy god and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them and testify against you this day that he shall surely perish you shall perish you shall perish even though they give you billions of dollars always get on your knees be ready to thank god respect your pastor the same way when you believe the message the same way you were coming when you started come to church money a small god [Music] when you have god you cannot be dominated by the people of the world yes even even a car can make fun of you ask your car yourself you start being a bit puffed up but the can tell you but this man was walking he used to work why is he being puffed up but this one it is the car [Music] m those things those things they've got quite a big place in these the sight of god we cannot come together and remain the same when we approach god when we come to him we must know what is god is required what does he want me to do i must know what am i supposed at church i'm not just going to meet people god is speaking to each and every one of you but each and everyone will have a particular the same print fingerprints for now they catch people by the police because of their fingerprints everyone is special according to what god comes and sometimes god will not come back to you if you are waiting for another god no one will take somebody else's place i don't know what you're left with alone what god has has planned for you no one will see him with him sisters no one is going to take it i want to go straight but god has reserved never be discouraged god does not just cut people like that has called me you and me that is what i'm saying in the message uh the resurrection of jesus resurrection of jesus christ [Music] [Music] it is when you are discouraged that's when the devil comes and got you i don't know i can save it i don't know i can say if i'm worthy or not they have prayed for me two times okay you must just go home dancing in the spirit she's thinking about her problems are not bigger than god you must know that your god is greater than your problems that thing is going to change my god is mighty that's my problem there's someone that's god wants you to be joyful the human heart was created enjoy something's gonna happen nothing now in here can you say thank you lord thank you lord i am happy i am happy i am happy in whatever you ask me [Applause] jerusalem you oh [Music] [Applause] um no
