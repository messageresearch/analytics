[1:51:25] this we are
[1:51:29] entering into that genuine
[1:51:37] eternity you know entering into
[1:51:44] eternity there is that
[1:51:49] pool that that's pulling you When you
[1:51:54] pray when you
[1:51:57] sing there's something in
[1:51:59] you pulling
[1:52:04] you
[1:52:10] into do you know what
[1:52:21] ET Maybe the whole day if we can stay
[1:52:25] here the whole day you'll realize at the
[1:52:27] end of the meeting that we are
[1:52:31] tired dragging our
[1:52:34] legs but here I'm talking about
[1:52:42] eternity and how many would love
[1:52:46] to find
[1:52:48] themselves there
[1:52:55] amen God is the
[1:52:58] king the Lord
[1:53:00] Jesus is the
[1:53:03] king I'm coming to read to
[1:53:08] you the part that
[1:53:12] says he is now a
[1:53:17] king Abraham when he was on Journey
[1:53:23] amen Amen on his way to the
[1:53:26] city the Bible says he
[1:53:31] met that
[1:53:34] king king of
[1:53:39] Sal so before you can
[1:53:42] arrive there you need to meet the king
[1:53:50] first without meeting the king
[1:53:53] it will be
[1:53:55] impossible to enter that
[1:53:59] City and I'm so
[1:54:02] glad the bride of
[1:54:04] Christ is in the form of that
[1:54:10] City you know you'll see the
[1:54:14] pyramid that the bread of
[1:54:17] Christ she is
[1:54:20] shaped in the form of a
[1:54:25] pyram and even the
[1:54:27] steps seven steps are in the
[1:54:32] pyam I've been reading about
[1:54:38] that seven
[1:54:40] steps in the
[1:54:43] pyramid then the prophet of God
[1:54:46] says the
[1:54:48] throne is seen from within
[1:54:57] Pam why the
[1:54:59] people are saying the seventh seal is
[1:55:01] not
[1:55:03] revealed it is because I will read when
[1:55:06] we
[1:55:07] come it is in the
[1:55:11] pyramid you know the first
[1:55:15] pyramid
[1:55:17] uh was of En Enoch amen there seven
[1:55:23] from
[1:55:25] Adam the second
[1:55:29] pyramid it
[1:55:31] is the
[1:55:35] prophet the
[1:55:37] seventh from
[1:55:42] Paul so seven
[1:55:46] s okay amen now I read here the pyramid
[1:55:52] pyramid and uh you know that one of
[1:55:58] Enoch back
[1:56:02] there it was not a
[1:56:05] municip it belonged to Enoch the S man
[1:56:12] from yeah it should be the
[1:56:17] seventh we'll bring it
[1:56:19] here we'll flush it
[1:56:23] and then well you all know it is the
[1:56:28] seventh but it says also the
[1:56:32] bright is
[1:56:35] shaped like a
[1:56:37] pyam amen that's what you say seven
[1:56:44] Church okay but I read before I

[1:57:17] amen now you can count your
[1:57:20] steps as you are

[1:57:35] somewhere but while
[1:57:38] working you go around picking some
[1:57:43] things sometimes building a house and so
