[0:00] and and make a man
[0:03] are we together anymore so Abraham
[0:07] Abraham was looking for a seat
[0:12] but when he was looking for receipts
[0:14] I'm saying there is something
[0:18] within him that was looking for a city
[0:22] and then when he arrived in the promised
[0:26] land
[0:28] and then the angel of the Lord came to
[0:31] him
[0:32] even Elohim himself
[0:35] right there was a time where he gave him
[0:38] a promise
[0:44] to a young man
[0:47] but now when he left home
[0:50] he was looking for a city
[0:57] a child
[0:58] no he was looking for a city
[1:04] gave him a child
[1:07] Isaac you know about it and then but
[1:10] still within himself
[1:12] he was looking for a city
[1:17] that is why most people
[1:20] they have this question is
[1:26] told to sacrifice his son
[1:32] he took his son and walked for almost
[1:36] three days
[1:42] what happened what would have happened
[1:45] if there was no Lambda
[1:49] would he really killed him and sacrifice
[1:54] him
[1:55] definitely
[1:58] because what he was doing our Sinners
[2:01] deal it was within himself
[2:05] there was something that was driving him
[2:08] [Music]
[2:12] that will give him a satisfaction
[2:15] the promise was
[2:18] go to the promised land
[2:21] and then what was he going to do to the
[2:23] promises
[2:24] to receive a promise
[2:27] now what was that promise it's a city
[2:32] yes it was not only the Sun
[2:37] but but it was the city
[2:40] then that's the only thing that could
[2:43] satisfy Abraham
[2:47] that is why when he met the the the
[2:49] prince of that scene
[2:53] he was satisfied
[2:58] are waiting for the changing of
[3:01] ours
[3:03] while we were waiting for the changing
[3:06] of our boys
[3:08] nobody will tell you whether you have
[3:12] seen that thing happening to you
[3:15] [Applause]
[3:17] you're the only one
[3:19] that knows whatever that you have Rich
[3:23] perfection
[3:26] uh
[3:31] [Music]
[3:35] the Lord himself
[3:37] comes through a predestination
[3:41] so now if it comes through a privilege
[3:43] let me put it this way
[3:45] we know all of us
[3:49] that we have we are hearing three uh we
[3:55] have got we've got body soul and Spirits
[3:59] now the Book of Job Booker job
[4:02] I think it's a
[4:04] in chapter
[4:07] 32
[4:09] 82 verse 8 if not 8 32 yes it says that
[4:14] there is a spirit in a man
[4:19] that's it
[4:20] and then that's the inspiration of God
[4:25] uses that Spirit
[4:27] and the Bible says I believe
[4:31] sorry let me let me read these
[4:33] scriptures
[4:35] so
[4:36] what what is happening here
[4:40] each and every preacher
[4:44] knows very well
[4:46] the difference
[4:48] so
[4:58] we all know that our sister
[5:09] he has just Departed
[5:13] and if you use the word department
[5:21] or he is asleep
[5:24] and then when he's asleep
[5:27] it definitely will woke up soon
[5:31] you see I mean so one that was the one
[5:35] that is dead
[5:37] is the one that will never meet God
[5:40] again
[5:43] God has turned his back against him
[5:49] and then because he was not in the plan
[5:52] of course
[5:55] so the one that is asleep
[5:58] like like uh
[6:03] that's our sister
[6:06] loved certain songs
[6:14] uh
[6:17] actually when the pastors preach about
[6:21] the Rapture
[6:24] the process of going
[6:27] she was also in that process of course
[6:32] together I mean and of course we know
[6:36] that when things like this happen
[6:40] we know that we we've got two kingdoms
[6:45] the kingdom of darkness
[6:47] and the kingdom of light
[6:49] and we've got different worlds
[6:53] the Bible says
[6:56] there's a new world that is coming
[6:58] [Music]
[6:59] and then the new heaven that is
[7:04] we have different bodies
[7:08] we are in this body here on Earth
[7:11] but when we departure recipe we go into
[7:15] another body
[7:17] we go and wait
[7:21] and then when the time comes for the
[7:24] resurrection
[7:25] and then when I say we're going wait
[7:29] we wait for the coming of the Lord
[7:32] because when the Lord comes
[7:36] there will be a resurrection
[7:39] so our sister will come back
[7:42] and then take a minute her soul
[7:46] peace a spirit
[7:48] will come and combine with his spirit
[7:53] and took the body
[7:55] then it will be herself
[7:58] then from there on
[8:02] then you she will change that point
[8:05] when that body changes
[8:08] look we have this terrestrial body
[8:12] and when we depart we put you on another
[8:16] boy
[8:18] which is Celestial is which you are
[8:21] going to wait with that
[8:23] but in the resurrection
[8:26] then comes the changing of the body
[8:29] and when that body changes
[8:32] then we put on now the glorified
[8:42] he's not going to appear as you saw him
[8:47] when she departed
[8:50] come home we know that she will be a
[8:54] young one
[8:54] [Music]
[9:12] you won't know me
[9:14] because I will be 21 years old
[9:19] [Applause]
[9:20] are we together anymore so now that is
[9:24] not a fake
[9:28] it's true
[9:32] that is why the Bible says
[9:34] within us
[9:37] there is a treasure
[9:39] are we together I mean you receive the
[9:42] word of God by faith
[9:45] because the Bible says
[10:00] Divine promises
[10:05] our promises
[10:10] they are Divine promises
[10:16] when the word of God proceeds
[10:20] it touches the Divine look look we are
[10:24] Ordinary People
[10:28] right but now in order that okay God is
[10:33] divine
[10:34] and his word is divine
[10:37] and all that
[10:40] we should be like God
[10:43] we need to change nature
[10:48] because the Bible says
[10:51] we need to have a divine nature
[10:57] we say God is in heaven
[11:00] and we are here God is divine
[11:05] we are natural
[11:07] now being natural in order to be like
[11:11] God we need to change to be like him now
[11:15] what is going to change us
[11:18] the very same word that you hear
[11:21] is going to form a being within you
[11:28] want to support yourself it will be a
[11:31] supernatural
[11:33] that's why now when you are waiting for
[11:36] the coming of them
[11:39] actually what is waiting for the coming
[11:41] of God
[11:43] is the being that is within you
[11:47] there's something within you
[11:50] that craves for the changes
[11:54] are we together now if there's something
[11:57] within you here that has germinated
[12:03] like actually the Bible says without
[12:07] faith God is not happy about you
[12:11] you receive the word by faith
[12:14] and when you receive the word by faith
[12:17] and then
[12:19] you start now that way it becomes it
[12:22] starts germinating then you receive the
[12:25] virtue
[12:27] because in this field
[12:31] Paul says yes
[12:33] there is
[12:49] waiting for a son
[12:52] and then now in order to receive that
[12:56] son
[12:58] the body must change
[13:01] are we together we are expecting a son
[13:06] are we together
[13:08] there should be somebody within us
[13:12] we are called the bright
[13:15] we are the bride carrying out in our
[13:18] Lord Jesus Christ
[13:20] Our Lord is a groom
[13:24] now we have to give pets
[13:28] [Applause]
[13:31] we have to give birth century
[13:36] are we together now the word
[13:40] must germinate to a Perfection
[13:45] when now he comes
[13:48] to fetch his bride he's not going to
[13:52] fetch this uh
[13:54] he's going to fetch the supernatural
[13:58] that is
[14:01] Supernatural that is in you
[14:04] the one that will bring about the
[14:07] changing of your questions foreign
[14:10] [Applause]
[14:39] right but I want us to go to First
[14:43] Corinthians chapter 15.
[14:46] now I'm talking now about the changing
[14:50] of the food
[14:54] you should know your inheritance
[14:58] you should know what God has promised
[15:01] you
[15:03] don't just worship because people are
[15:06] worshiping
[15:09] exactly what you want yeah
[15:17] it says a lot of people
[15:20] they don't know what they want
[15:24] they don't know what are they expecting
[15:29] are we together so you should know what
[15:32] you are expecting
[15:34] there's been a lot of things that are
[15:36] are passing by
[15:39] do you remember Elijah
[15:41] was in a cave
[15:45] so while he was in the cave
[15:47] there was a things that were passing by
[15:52] but that never shook Elijah because he
[15:56] knew what he was waiting
[16:22] Corinthians chapter 15.
[16:25] yeah
[16:27] always
[16:28] we read that scripture when okay let's
[16:32] start from verse 22. 2
[16:37] verse 22 said
[16:39] for as in Adam all die
[16:45] even so in Christ shall all he made
[16:49] alive
[16:53] foreign
[17:10] let's go on to
[17:12] I'll come back to this one
[17:14] let's jump over to verse 45
[17:18] 45. verse 45 said
[17:21] and so it is written the first man Adam
[17:25] was made a living soul
[17:28] s
[17:33] last Adam was made a quickening spirit
[17:41] and if you go to John 6 63 John 6 63 it
[17:48] says it is the spirit that quickeneth
[17:51] opener
[18:16] right the Lost Adam was made a
[18:20] quickening spirit
[18:23] now when it says it's a quickening
[18:26] spirit
[18:27] it means you receive something
[18:31] that is quickening your life
[18:35] she will move from Faith
[18:39] from all those virtues
[18:42] until you get a quickening power to
[18:45] cross over
[18:48] together now a quickening power
[18:52] has to do with the changing of the body
[19:13] that is in process
[19:17] it's like like always when the pastor
[19:20] preaches about the plane that is on on
[19:23] the running word
[19:29] it's something that is in process
[19:34] so the thing that is born within you
[19:38] one day is the very same thing that is
[19:41] going to change
[19:44] [Applause]
[19:46] now that's what we call Resurrection
[19:48] Resurrection
[19:51] does not happen with it it does not
[19:54] happen
[19:56] automatically
[20:00] when the Resurrection comes you won't
[20:03] feel surprised
[20:08] no it's a thing that is in you
[20:12] are together I mean now right now
[20:17] we have different Ministries
[20:23] different dispensations
[20:26] let me explain it
[20:29] it was a time
[20:31] when the children of Israel
[20:35] bondage
[20:37] and God sent Moses
[20:40] to go and take them out of bondage
[20:45] and Moses took them out
[20:48] they crossed the Red Sea
[20:51] and then they they was in a process
[20:58] now until they reach the river children
[21:03] now when they reach the River Jordan
[21:07] the dispensation changed
[21:11] Moses just to walk
[21:13] and left Joshua Joshua now Joshua make
[21:19] them to cross over Joshua
[21:22] now is the next dispensation
[21:27] his dispensation is
[21:40] was to take them out
[21:44] let them cross the river's children
[21:53] and let them drink water and move on
[21:58] and then when Joshua come in
[22:01] the ministry changed
[22:05] now in order that they should cross over
[22:09] the ministry must change
[22:17] will do some things
[22:20] that will surprise everybody
[22:24] like Moses
[22:26] he surprised everybody
[22:30] with the stick actually
[22:33] Israel Israel
[22:36] as the pillar of fire
[22:40] but Moses came with a stick
[22:44] how would you get that that is the
[22:46] ministry that he was given by God
[22:49] that is the dispensation of the stick
[22:54] all together I mean and that's you let
[22:58] them cross the Red Sea
[23:01] so now without that sick
[23:05] useless
[23:07] are we together and then when he crossed
[23:10] when he left them
[23:13] Joshua took over
[23:15] it was another Ministry
[23:18] so now what was happening remember
[23:29] before they could cross the River Jordan
[23:32] the River Jordan was in flood
[23:36] they took them right to the floods
[23:40] he did not use the sticks
[23:45] said no
[23:47] actually he made an altar right in the
[23:49] order
[23:53] and they cross over and then when he's
[23:56] in that side
[23:58] he met the first thing that he made
[24:01] was an angel
[24:09] do you know what Joshua did said who are
[24:11] you
[24:12] I'm the captain of this house
[24:16] Joshua understood the language
[24:21] he didn't say where do you come from
[24:23] what is your name I just understood
[24:28] that now this is
[24:32] now what I want you to say it was Joshua
[24:36] that was giving instructions
[24:44] was the one that is a a manifesting
[24:49] he was not seen by a naked eye
[24:53] there was many first things
[24:59] [Applause]
[25:11] when it changes the ministry it will
[25:16] surprise the whole world
[25:20] because that should be the minister that
[25:23] is the minister Ministry that must give
[25:26] you a rapturing faith
[25:30] ful are we together now while we are
[25:33] still on that Ministry
[25:35] some will be departing
[25:38] by the same ministers
[25:45] now
[25:46] our Lord Jesus Christ
[25:49] one day was with his disciples
[25:52] and then they they had the Lord
[25:57] but before they had the loads up
[26:00] he said to them
[26:02] this evening
[26:05] you are all going to be disappointed
[26:10] yeah because what happened
[26:14] his ministry
[26:16] was to show the world that he's a Son of
[26:19] God together
[26:23] now to show the world that is the Son of
[26:25] God as long as that Ministry was not
[26:30] recognized
[26:31] he wouldn't stop
[26:34] if if you read John 10. he says I and my
[26:39] father
[26:41] and then he said to them and I think in
[26:44] verse 35
[26:46] all the things that I've done
[26:50] why do stone
[26:52] what do you Stone me for
[26:56] I've done a lot of things
[27:02] for making miracles
[27:07] doing good things
[27:16] because you are a man
[27:19] you make yourself
[27:25] if you were if you were living during
[27:28] that time
[27:30] you will see sense in what the Pharisees
[27:33] were saying
[27:34] [Music]
[27:36] she spoke sense
[27:39] we don't want science we want revelation
[27:46] so now
[27:49] but what happened is in Matthew 16.
[27:54] he said he asked what would you his
[27:58] disciples
[28:00] that when people see me foreign
[28:26] [Music]
[28:30] [Applause]
[28:36] foreign
[28:44] right I'll tell you but from that day
[28:48] he started preaching about going to
[28:51] Jerusalem
[28:53] you see he was on that way
[28:57] he was on rapturing
[29:00] but his ministry has a surprise
[29:05] even his own disciples
[29:12] get deep behind me
[29:15] he called him the angel of the devil
[29:19] because Peter was saying that the
[29:22] ministry is
[29:29] that could multiply bread
[29:35] who can touch that man
[29:40] so he repeated again
[29:43] this evening I wish you are going to be
[29:46] disappointed
[29:47] [Music]
[29:48] and then Peter said
[29:51] yes they are going to be disappeared but
[29:54] not me
[29:55] [Applause]
[29:57] now you read the Bible
[30:00] all the disciples turn against Jesus
[30:06] because of the changing of his ministry
[30:10] changing of his sermon
[30:14] you are going Peter said not me Peter
[30:17] remember you remember even say you open
[30:20] up
[30:21] before the conquers you know the first
[30:25] time you'll be you'll deny me three
[30:28] times
[30:32] now it's the change now
[30:35] the Bible is say the Bible says he's the
[30:38] same yesterday today
[30:41] what he did then
[30:44] he will do it
[30:47] right what what happened
[30:50] there was a time
[30:53] where
[30:55] he said to them
[30:57] okay because you said I must not go to
[31:03] uh
[31:06] Jerusalem and be crucified
[31:10] let's go and pray
[31:13] that that thing should not happen
[31:15] foreign
[31:18] God cannot change his is what you call
[31:23] his promise you remember he divided his
[31:28] disciples
[31:30] are going to push into two portions
[31:33] and the third one
[31:36] I was I was saying to some other
[31:38] children I was teaching them
[31:41] said now how many disciples did Jesus
[31:45] have
[31:46] um
[31:56] he took he took three of them
[32:02] you pray here
[32:05] and you the other age
[32:09] I'm going to pray
[32:14] now I said to these children
[32:17] remember what was the uh what you call
[32:21] the the what were they praying for
[32:26] because he says I am going to be
[32:30] persecuted
[32:33] now when they pray and say oh Lord
[32:38] save our master
[32:40] foreign
[33:42] so I said but hear him saying
[33:49] [Applause]
[33:51] because it's something that must happen
[33:56] so when things
[33:58] are going to the end
[34:01] there is always a pleasure
[34:04] the changing of the Ministries
[34:11] and then from now on
[34:14] they could not even understand they have
[34:17] won a Peter said thou at the Christ
[34:20] the son of the Living God and he was
[34:23] given the key
[34:26] of the kingdom of heaven
[34:28] with that Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
[34:32] without the the anointing that comes
[34:35] from God
[34:37] it'll make a mess up
[34:41] so I'm sure you all can hear
[34:45] I'm not talking about a dead person
[34:49] I'm talking about the ministry
[34:52] that gave her job
[35:00] together I mean now look at that thing
[35:04] okay fine now you heard the Bible says
[35:10] uh
[35:11] let me re-read it again
[35:16] I read the first Corinthians chapter 15.
[35:21] I read only verse 22.
[35:25] and I don't have watching before
[35:35] okay
[35:36] for in Adam all died
[35:41] even saw in Christ shall all be made
[35:45] alive
[35:48] so now how are they made alive
[35:53] there should be a spirit that quickened
[35:56] them
[35:56] [Applause]
[36:00] how to get remote
[36:02] so now a quickening spirit
[36:07] must have
[36:09] Faith
[36:14] ready must have a dispensation
[36:22] you cannot
[36:25] preach the right thing
[36:28] with the wrong dispensation
[36:38] will be diverted
[36:42] I've given you an example about the
[36:44] disciples
[36:47] your prayers should be in line is
[36:52] what God is doing at that time
[36:56] [Applause]
[36:58] are we together
[36:59] now what was God doing during our Lord
[37:03] Jesus Christ
[37:08] remember the Bible says
[37:11] without controversy
[37:15] great is the mystery of godliness
[37:19] he was speaking about God In the Flesh
[37:23] now in our time
[37:25] what are we waiting
[37:29] we are even on Sunday pasta
[37:33] that's the word has been delivered
[37:37] the word has been revealed now what what
[37:42] else is the manifestation of government
[37:47] that word must be manifested now
[37:53] in order that the word must be
[37:55] manifested
[37:56] it should be child Angels
[38:00] so that the weight must be manifested
[38:05] look
[38:07] if you are fighting the devil
[38:10] and you find that that devil is so weak
[38:15] we won't be sure about your victory
[38:25] you must have a very strong devil
[38:30] and
[38:35] [Applause]
[38:40] [Music]
[38:43] [Applause]
[38:50] lay they choose themselves The Whole
[38:54] World Imagine The Old World
[38:57] you have only 12 people that support you
[39:02] together now that you show how powerful
[39:06] is your ministry now
[39:13] if okay you call God
[39:17] standing at the right point
[39:20] he's bound to hear you
[39:23] you know why I say he's bound to hear
[39:26] you
[39:27] because God will be seeing his son
[39:33] now who is the Son of God
[39:35] the word is the son
[39:41] yes he said he said let us make man in
[39:45] our way
[39:47] after our likeness
[39:50] in the beginning
[39:52] was the weight the weight was with God
[39:57] now when you start processing himself
[40:00] he became the wait yeah and then now he
[40:03] wants you to be the wait too
[40:06] then that way must manifest himself
[40:11] that is
[40:13] our Lord Jesus Christ there was a time
[40:17] when he was Jesus
[40:21] when he was Jesus I have Energies then
[40:24] one day
[40:25] Heaven opened
[40:27] and then when the heaven opened
[40:31] and then Christ
[40:35] the Son of God
[40:38] descended
[40:39] in Jesus
[40:41] now if you go to uh
[40:49] Acts chapter 2 verse 36 says
[40:54] that very same Jesus
[41:01] has made him
[41:03] Lord and Christine
[41:07] that man made him the Lord and Christ
[41:10] because
[41:15] the word of God
[41:17] descended in him
[41:19] now when the word of God descended in
[41:22] Jesus
[41:24] the word of God is preached in you
[41:28] and when you receive that word of God
[41:31] informed his son
[41:34] it becomes the word itself
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:38] you read it in uh
[41:41] the The Book of John chapter 10.
[41:46] are we together so now what we are
[41:49] talking about here
[41:51] we're talking about going home
[41:57] see if one goes home we become happy
[42:01] because we see the manifestation
[42:04] of the promise god promise that we will
[42:08] go
[42:09] some will go before us
[42:13] but where they are now
[42:18] maybe I will read one scripture and
[42:21] close because it's nine o'clock we said
[42:23] we'll finish at night
[42:25] now
[42:26] there's one scripture that I want us to
[42:29] read
[42:30] so I said where they are now
[42:36] uh they they are very happy
[42:43] now the thing is
[42:46] the supernatural
[42:49] it's not something that you can explain
[42:53] it should be revealed to an individuals
[43:03] if you can go to heaven now
[43:06] and come back and say and tell us copies
[43:25] [Music]
[43:34] [Applause]
[43:43] [Applause]
[43:53] [Applause]
[44:01] [Music]
[44:07] the scriptures repeat itself
[44:12] our Lord Jesus Christ
[44:14] they knew him
[44:18] they knew him as the son of Mary and
[44:21] Joseph
[44:22] now when he says he's the son of God
[44:26] that's why I said no to a normal person
[44:31] he was saying something that a
[44:35] far-fetched thing
[44:37] but it foreign
[44:50] [Music]
[45:21] somebody said to me
[45:24] you guys who are preaching about the
[45:26] underwear
[45:28] in which Dimensions
[45:33] the prophet taught us
[45:35] there's a fifth Dimensions
[45:42] now where is this underworld
[45:50] [Applause]
[45:52] the prophet the prophet and the Bible
[45:55] the Bible speaks about dimensions
[46:00] but the prophet comes in to speak about
[46:03] the levels of the dimensions
[46:08] he said In Heaven
[46:11] There are levels
[46:13] [Applause]
[46:16] that is why the seven steps to the
[46:18] king's Chambers
[46:25] my place will be in Hallelujah foreign
[46:40] [Music]
[46:56] the king of darkness is
[47:01] has a level where now
[47:04] the Angels not kept not their first
[47:07] estate
[47:15] there are levels when the souls that are
[47:18] in prison
[47:22] that is why the Bible speaks about which
[47:25] season speak about it
[47:28] it's in the Bible it's in a level
[47:33] the man you know tomorrow can be made
[47:38] not that the mind is Disturbed
[47:44] now don't ask me how um
[47:49] but what happened is his memories
[47:53] his reasoning is gone imagination is
[47:56] gone
[47:59] even if it could be your brother he
[48:02] wouldn't recognize you
[48:05] that's it and then where is the soul of
[48:08] that individual
[48:13] because in The Fifth Dimension
[48:16] is the souls that of the people that are
[48:20] dead
[48:22] right but this person is alive
[48:27] okay at times
[48:31] it's
