[2:13:39] Philip don't you know that Philip I was
[2:13:42] with my father my father is in me this

[2:15:24] you come this way
[2:15:28] amen
[2:15:39] I in you and you in me yeah
[2:15:48] see
[2:15:49] the money forward
[2:15:54] manifestation
[2:15:59] to bring it back
[2:16:03] now at that day you shall know
[2:16:07] in my father
[2:16:13] was supposed to be manifested amen

[2:16:28] [Music]
[2:16:34] when God speaks they speak
[2:16:38] amen When God Says
[2:16:51] they don't come second to that now hide
[2:17:04] you remember
[2:17:06] they were three
[2:17:08] they said to Abraham
[2:17:11] where is your wife
[2:17:15] Abraham said back in the tents
[2:17:19] ended he said why said he not there I
[2:17:24] born
[2:17:26] he said why is it
[2:17:29] I shall return

[2:18:43] not your head
[2:18:44] um
[2:18:54] which can be ahead with a headache
[2:19:03] then they say when the Revelation comes
[2:19:07] forth we must speak example this is
[2:19:09] another thing
[2:19:12] why you know sometimes we used to
[2:19:14] worship without any revelation we have
[2:19:17] the questions
[2:19:32] that's why we used to
[2:19:35] even try to read many books
[2:19:43] yes Samaritan woman says when he is
[2:19:56] will tell us all things
[2:20:01] not every body can tell you all things

[2:21:37] foreign it is the father who has spoken
[2:21:42] the whole body now um amen
[2:21:50] the body of Christ is
[2:21:52] not five people they're saying a
[2:21:55] difference
[2:22:04] I know the people don't want me to say
[2:22:06] this yes
[2:22:10] it is because they didn't hear Brothers
[2:22:19] saying some other things amen
[2:22:35] I
[2:22:37] yeah let me read
[2:22:46] that day you will know
[2:22:52] it means that you will you will know
[2:22:59] that that here is that thing the ocean
[2:23:03] your teeth
[2:23:08] mean it's not one thing
[2:23:13] threefold Revelations
[2:23:20] and
[2:23:23] you'll know that I am in the Father the
[2:23:25] father is in me

[2:23:40] and
[2:23:41] I will continue now now let's take this
[2:23:45] other scripture
[2:23:49] and then from there we are going to
[2:23:52] carry on like that
[2:23:56] God will help us to finish
[2:24:03] all right amen
[2:24:07] I'm going to look at
[2:24:10] the other scripture you need to Mark
[2:24:13] Baker
[2:24:16] um
[2:24:26] [Music]
[2:24:30] come to pass know that it is
[2:24:33] not even at the doors

[2:24:42] things be done Heaven and Earth shall
[2:24:44] pass away but my way shall not pass away
[2:24:48] but of that day in that hour noeth no
[2:24:51] man

[2:24:54] neither the son but the father
[2:24:57] okay

[2:25:01] opening of the seals is
[2:25:13] foreign
[2:25:40] foreign
[2:25:51] look no men
[2:25:53] nor angels which are in heaven
[2:25:58] alone

[2:26:15] Luke chapter three
[2:26:18] times

[2:26:36] last this one
[2:26:39] it comes to Adams
[2:26:45] which was the son of knows which was the
[2:26:48] son of Seth which was the son of Adam

[2:28:00] beyond the sunship
[2:28:07] if you go back to this threefold
[2:28:10] Revelation together
