[1:13:53] and father you are also the one that
[1:13:56] anoints your church amen and reveal
[1:13:59] yourself Lord unto your church.
[1:14:02] Hallelujah. So you will never you said
[1:14:05] with your own mouth Lord that you will
[1:14:07] always be with us. Amen. And you said
[1:14:10] you will never forsake us.
[1:14:13] That is why father we are gathered in
[1:14:16] this way. Amen. Knowing that father
[1:14:19] there is an anointing in this
[1:14:21] tabernacle. Hallelujah. And knowing that
[1:14:23] there's a guidance in this tabernacle.
[1:14:26] Amen. And also knowing that now uh we

[1:14:40] gave that angel yes be upon us Lord as
[1:14:43] we are going to proclaim your word.
[1:14:46] Thank you father. May your uh the
[1:14:49] believers that are sitting down there be

[1:15:14] that fruit of the land.
[1:15:16] Thank you, Father. Bless each and
[1:15:18] everyone that is here, Lord, in the name
[1:15:20] of our Lord Jesus Christ and the word
[1:15:22] that we're going to preach. You'll be
[1:15:25] the one, Lord Almighty, that will bring
[1:15:27] it forth. Amen. In Jesus Christ, my
[1:15:29] Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:32] Okay. God bless you.
[1:15:36] So,
[1:15:38] uh, I'm going to surprise
[1:15:43] you reading a verse
[1:15:46] that is well known to
[1:15:51] you. But it's for a
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:15:57] purpose. Let's read Malachi chapter 4.
[1:16:02] 4
[1:16:05] verse 5 and 6. Verse 5.
[1:16:14] Malachi chapter 4 from verse
[1:16:17] 5-6. Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[1:16:21] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:16:23] and dreadful day of the Lord. And he
[1:16:26] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[1:16:29] the children. Amen. and the heart of the
[1:16:32] children to their fathers, lest I come
[1:16:34] and smite the earth with a case. Amen.
[1:16:38] You may be seated. God bless you.
[1:16:46] You I know you are familiar with this
[1:16:50] verse. You sing it every day.
[1:16:57] But you know that if I can round you up
[1:17:00] one by
[1:17:05] one. Some of you may not explain
[1:17:12] that. I always say when I
[1:17:16] preach, if it was at
[1:17:19] school, I would say those that
[1:17:21] understand it, raise your hand.
[1:17:26] But you are here to hear the word of
[1:17:29] God, not to raise your hand.
[1:17:34] Okay? The Bible says
[1:17:37] here, "Behold, I will send you Elijah
[1:17:41] the
[1:17:44] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:17:48] and dreadful day of the Lord.
[1:17:56] So my title
[1:17:59] will be that one,
[1:18:02] the
[1:18:03] great and dreadful day of the
[1:18:07] [Music]
[1:18:11] Lord because it
[1:18:14] says he will send that
[1:18:17] prophet before that day.
[1:18:21] What I want you to notice is this.
[1:18:26] It says
[1:18:27] uh and he shall turn
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:32] the
[1:18:34] heart not the
[1:18:37] hearts says the heart of the fathers.
[1:18:44] Fathers is in
[1:18:49] plural and heart is a
[1:18:53] singular. Why is it like
[1:18:57] that? And it goes on and
[1:19:00] says and the
[1:19:02] heart of the
[1:19:05] children to their
[1:19:09] fathers and the heart there
[1:19:13] It's a
[1:19:16] singular but the
[1:19:18] children is not
[1:19:22] singular. So let me explain why is it
[1:19:25] like that.
[1:19:29] You see uh one day the pastor stood here
[1:19:36] and then he spoke about the
[1:19:39] pyramid pyramid and he spoke about the
[1:19:45] blood. So he didn't say the
[1:19:50] blood. No says the blood.
[1:19:55] You still remember that day.
[1:19:58] He said you are the blood.
[1:20:04] Remember the the the the Holy
[1:20:09] Ghost or the example that our Lord Jesus
[1:20:12] Christ
[1:20:15] gave. He said he took the
[1:20:19] bread and said
[1:20:22] eat this is my flesh.
[1:20:28] and took the
[1:20:29] wine and said,
[1:20:32] "Drink. This is my blood."
[1:20:37] And then he was accused
[1:20:40] for says now he's a
[1:20:44] vampire. He wants people to eat his
[1:20:51] flesh and drink his and drink his blood.
[1:20:56] So you know that when he was put in the
[1:21:00] grave, his body was in the
[1:21:05] grave, there were
[1:21:08] soldiers that were guiding
[1:21:11] them, right? Amen. But those
[1:21:18] soldiers didn't see him resurrected.
[1:21:26] So now they were supposed to be punished
[1:21:28] because they were guarding the throne.
[1:21:30] They should tell what happened.
[1:21:42] Instead they were
[1:21:46] bribed that they should
[1:21:49] say he said they must eat his
[1:21:54] flesh. So they came at
[1:21:57] night and took the
[1:21:59] body and they ate his
[1:22:03] flesh. Instead of punishing
[1:22:05] them, they bribe them that they should
[1:22:08] say
[1:22:10] that it is
[1:22:12] because the supernatural
[1:22:17] happened. There was a
[1:22:21] resurrection and the
[1:22:24] resurrection has to do with the
[1:22:26] quickening of the
[1:22:30] body. Now I think
[1:22:33] The pastor
[1:22:36] has given us all that we
[1:22:41] need. Amen. He has gone through the
[1:22:46] Bible from
[1:22:48] Genesis up to the book of
[1:22:52] Revelation. What we're doing now,
[1:22:57] uh, it's just clearing up here and
[1:22:59] there.
[1:23:03] But there's nothing that you don't
[1:23:06] know. Amen. God is the one that gives
[1:23:09] you revelation,
[1:23:13] right? Amen.
[1:23:15] So at times he will stand
[1:23:18] here and start crying.
[1:23:25] I don't know how many of
[1:23:30] you recognize why he is crying.
[1:23:40] And then how many
[1:23:43] times did he
[1:23:45] say my
[1:23:49] to
[1:23:51] those that want to make it
[1:23:59] It is
[1:24:02] because when he is studying,
[1:24:06] God
[1:24:08] shows him.
[1:24:11] And now the word of
[1:24:15] God must manifest itself to an
[1:24:19] individual.
[1:24:20] [Music]
[1:24:24] It's not that it's not something that
[1:24:26] you will explain and somebody
[1:24:33] understand our Lord Jesus
[1:24:37] Christ. There will be people that
[1:24:39] follows him
[1:24:45] and then he will teach them in parables.
[1:24:51] And then at
[1:24:53] night when he is with his
[1:24:58] disciples then the the sermon that he
[1:25:02] preached during the
[1:25:05] day will be explained.
[1:25:09] No. Until they asked
[1:25:12] him, why is it like
[1:25:15] that? He said to them, "It's because you
[1:25:19] are
[1:25:21] chosen. Those people, they see but they
[1:25:25] can't
[1:25:28] see. And they hear but they cannot
[1:25:30] understand."
[1:25:33] The word of the Lord,
[1:25:36] the revelation of the
[1:25:39] word is to those who are part of it.
[1:25:49] Now what has happened now?
[1:25:55] There are those
[1:25:57] things actually I said uh my title no my
[1:26:02] title is not the one that I gave you.
[1:26:06] My title
[1:26:07] is the great tribulation after the
[1:26:10] rapture. I'm sorry about
[1:26:17] it. After the
[1:26:19] rapture there will be great tribulation.
[1:26:23] So, we'll touch on those,
[1:26:26] but what I wanted to say is just we're
[1:26:29] just iring
[1:26:34] up are we together,
[1:26:38] right?
[1:26:40] There are before we go to
[1:26:44] uh the things that will happen after the
[1:26:46] rapture,
[1:26:50] let's
[1:26:52] uh bring what you
[1:26:56] call the things that happened before the
[1:27:03] rapture. so that you you could have an
[1:27:07] idea of what we will be talking
[1:27:11] about. Now, I've got a
[1:27:16] slide that says the great tribulation
[1:27:19] after the rapture one them. Yeah. No,
[1:27:20] not that one. Not that one.
[1:27:25] Yeah. Yeah. That's the one. Yes.
[1:27:29] Look at that that that that uh slide.
[1:27:35] It's it shows
[1:27:38] the Jew dispensation
[1:27:42] and the gentile
[1:27:45] dispensation. Amen. Right. Let's go to
[1:27:48] the Jew dispensation.
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:53] It speaks about Elijah the prophet
[1:27:58] which is John
[1:28:01] who turn the heart. Oh, let me explain
[1:28:04] the issue of a
[1:28:07] heart. They believed in in in the in the
[1:28:11] in the in the law of Moses.
[1:28:16] In that law of
[1:28:18] Moses, they were one
[1:28:22] heart. And if you come to the the the
[1:28:26] other Elijah this
[1:28:30] side speaking about the
[1:28:34] Gentiles, the
[1:28:37] church, the
[1:28:39] bride is one heart.
[1:28:44] You are yes
[1:28:47] individuals. Amen. But as individuals,
[1:28:53] the
[1:28:54] ministry of the
[1:28:57] seven gives you a
[1:29:00] revelation and then it makes
[1:29:03] you a bride.
[1:29:07] What is in
[1:29:09] me is in
[1:29:15] brother and what is in me and
[1:29:19] brother is in you
[1:29:22] here. The
[1:29:24] word makes us a
[1:29:28] family and the
[1:29:30] family is one heart.
[1:29:35] All of us we become one thing.
[1:29:40] Apart from
[1:29:42] that we will be fooling ourselves.
[1:29:47] If there is a difference between me
[1:29:55] and
[1:29:59] claiming that my body one day will will
[1:30:02] will change.
[1:30:07] what is supposed to change my
[1:30:11] body is the
[1:30:13] word. Now the word that is in
[1:30:17] him and is the word that is in
[1:30:20] me. The word does not
[1:30:23] differ. It makes us
[1:30:26] one. All right. Now let's go to the to
[1:30:30] the slide itself.
[1:30:33] The Jews
[1:30:36] believe the law of Moses.
[1:30:41] And when John
[1:30:44] came was to change
[1:30:48] that because the Messiah was
[1:30:52] coming. So it was for running the
[1:30:54] Messiah as you can
[1:30:57] see. So their
[1:31:00] heart must
[1:31:03] change
[1:31:05] to the it must turn to the the new
[1:31:12] ministry so that they could receive the
[1:31:18] Messiah. That is why he was
[1:31:23] baptizing. When he
[1:31:25] sees that your heart
[1:31:28] has turned
[1:31:31] from your fathers.
[1:31:34] Then he gives
[1:31:37] you I mean he baptize you then we are
[1:31:40] ready
[1:31:42] now waiting for the
[1:31:45] Messiah. When the Messiah comes, he's
[1:31:48] just going to point
[1:31:50] him and you will
[1:31:52] believe because you'll be waiting for
[1:31:54] the Messiah.
[1:31:57] And then when he says there's the
[1:32:02] Messiah, then you need to follow the
[1:32:07] Messiah. That that is all.
[1:32:10] Should you have any
[1:32:14] question, he points you to the Messiah.
[1:32:18] [Applause]
[1:32:19] His ministry
[1:32:22] was he was in
[1:32:24] prison. They went to him and say that
[1:32:28] man you said is a
[1:32:30] messiah is
[1:32:32] baptizing. He said it's none of my
[1:32:35] business. go and ask him
[1:32:39] because it should be a
[1:32:43] revelation and when they went to
[1:32:47] Jesus and say h we are from
[1:32:52] John we don't understand what's going
[1:32:55] on you're confusing
[1:32:58] us he never says sit down brothers let
[1:33:01] me
[1:33:03] explain you know But again, and that
[1:33:06] messiah that
[1:33:09] you definitely sure I'm telling you the
[1:33:11] truth.
[1:33:13] No. Uhuh. He said, "Were you in the
[1:33:18] river Jordan?
[1:33:21] Were you there?" They said, "Yes." Said,
[1:33:24] "What did you see?
[1:33:28] Did you see the
[1:33:31] reads blown by the wind?
[1:33:37] You see he's not he says now there's no
[1:33:39] one like
[1:33:41] John the
[1:33:43] prophets. There's no
[1:33:45] one that has pointed the Messiah with
[1:33:49] his
[1:33:52] finger. He just left them there
[1:33:56] because that was for specific
[1:34:01] people. That is why he never sat down
[1:34:04] and preached to
[1:34:08] Peter. No, he said follow me.
[1:34:12] Amen.
[1:34:14] Right. Amen. He called him from another
[1:34:16] dimension
[1:34:20] and is speaking from another Amen.
[1:34:28] body
[1:34:29] look the Bible
[1:34:33] says the Lord
[1:34:35] says behold
[1:34:37] I create
[1:34:40] a new earth.
[1:34:43] and a new
[1:34:45] heaven. See what he says.
[1:34:50] Now when he brings the new
[1:34:54] earth, a new
[1:34:57] heaven, he cannot take this old
[1:35:02] body and took it to the new
[1:35:05] earth, a new heaven.
[1:35:09] So he must create a new
[1:35:13] body for that new
[1:35:16] earth and that new
[1:35:18] heaven. Amen. Right. Amen. So that is
[1:35:23] why now this body must
[1:35:28] change. Right. Amen. So the
[1:35:31] ministry of the
[1:35:33] seven has to
[1:35:35] do with the changing of people.
[1:35:40] That should be your
[1:35:42] dream. That should be your
[1:35:47] meditation of changing your body.
[1:35:52] Right. Amen. All right. Let's go back uh
[1:35:56] uh to that to that to that to that. Now
[1:35:59] you see there is a
[1:36:03] line that that that divides the Jews and
[1:36:06] the Gentiles.
[1:36:10] Right. Amen. Okay. You've already
[1:36:13] understand that.
[1:36:15] Now turn the
[1:36:17] heart of the father from the law of
[1:36:23] Moses to that one of the
[1:36:28] Messiah. Right. Amen. And
[1:36:32] thereafter, let's leave it like that. We
[1:36:35] start with Pentecost. Now,
[1:36:38] on the Gentiles.
[1:36:42] Remember,
[1:36:43] it went on and
[1:36:45] on from all the seven church
[1:36:51] ages. Right at the
[1:36:54] end, God raised a
[1:36:58] prophet that is brother Brenham. Brother
[1:37:00] Bren.
[1:37:02] Now his ministry,
[1:37:06] he will start first
[1:37:08] to turn
[1:37:10] the heart of the
[1:37:13] children which is
[1:37:17] ourself to our
[1:37:21] fathers. Who are the
[1:37:24] fathers? The apostles
[1:37:28] back to the foundation.
[1:37:31] Then after back to the
[1:37:35] foundation, then when we are settled
[1:37:39] now, right at the
[1:37:42] foundation, doing things every the right
[1:37:46] way.
[1:37:49] Look, the prophet says
[1:37:52] uh Luther preached
[1:37:56] in this book standing in the gap in
[1:37:59] paragraph 76.
[1:38:01] Paragraph 76. Luther preached.
[1:38:05] Luther justification,
[1:38:09] but he let it run wild
[1:38:14] because he didn't live long enough.
[1:38:21] So he left it halfway.
[1:38:26] Then they
[1:38:30] organized and then he says Luther never
[1:38:36] organized. But they
[1:38:39] organized and then Wesley
[1:38:43] came. After Wesley, they got the
[1:38:46] Wesleyan churches
[1:38:53] and then after
[1:38:54] that came John Smith,
[1:38:57] the Baptist,
[1:38:59] Alexander Cable, Alexander and so forth.
[1:39:03] But the
[1:39:05] men, the
[1:39:07] reformers, the reformers didn't live
[1:39:10] long
[1:39:13] enough to get it all
[1:39:17] together. You see? Amen. So there was a
[1:39:21] gap that
[1:39:22] they could not
[1:39:24] bring the church
[1:39:28] together from
[1:39:30] Luther up up up to John Wesley.
[1:39:35] They could not bring it together. They
[1:39:37] let it loose.
[1:39:40] But the reformers didn't live long
[1:39:45] enough to get it all
[1:39:50] together and saw a lot of loose ends.
[1:39:59] Right. Amen. And then
[1:40:03] when sorry and then when they did for
[1:40:06] instance of the water baptism
[1:40:11] that John Smith brought
[1:40:14] back by
[1:40:16] immensing
[1:40:17] but using wrong
[1:40:21] titles. Those are the loose
[1:40:25] ends. Right. Amen. And then when we come
[1:40:28] down to the
[1:40:31] end, the last
[1:40:33] message supposed to straighten that all
[1:40:36] up.
[1:40:41] bring these things to one
[1:40:45] faith, one
[1:40:47] Lord, one
[1:40:49] baptism, right? Amen. Then there's the
[1:40:53] important one. Then you
[1:40:56] notice it's open up the top of the
[1:41:01] pyramid.
[1:41:05] It it it can't be kept.
[1:41:08] with loose
[1:41:12] ends. That is why the pyramid
[1:41:16] pyramid uh the church ages
[1:41:20] during the church ages the pyramid was
[1:41:23] not
[1:41:25] kept because it has loosed
[1:41:30] [Music]
[1:41:32] ends.
[1:41:34] Then men who teach that pyramid
[1:41:41] doctrine, I guess they know what they're
[1:41:45] talking about.
[1:41:49] So any
[1:41:51] man that will
[1:41:54] teach about the pyramid
[1:41:57] doctrine pyramid, he knows what he's
[1:42:01] talking about.
[1:42:03] Because it won't be a
[1:42:06] man. It will be God
[1:42:10] himself teach that pyramid
[1:42:14] doctrine. That pyramid
[1:42:17] doctrine it comes
[1:42:20] down from
[1:42:23] eternity. the seventh
[1:42:26] angel and the
[1:42:29] one that will receive
[1:42:32] that doctrine.
[1:42:34] It's not from here.
[1:42:39] [Applause]
[1:42:40] So when there's angels
[1:42:43] came, they came with their own
[1:42:48] stuff. They came with their the people
[1:42:51] that will understand.
[1:42:56] When brother Brennan Brother was in the
[1:42:59] sixth dimension,
[1:43:02] he said, "Where's Paul?"
[1:43:05] They says, "No, Paul is in another
[1:43:08] level." And then they say,
[1:43:12] "And then Brenham said, I've taught
[1:43:15] exactly what Paul
[1:43:19] said." I said, "No, we're waiting upon
[1:43:21] that." That that were called his
[1:43:28] people in the sixth dimension,
[1:43:32] he had his his
[1:43:36] people, right? Amen. So
[1:43:40] now if in the sixth dimension, sixth
[1:43:43] dimension he had his people.
[1:43:47] now
[1:43:48] hear the ministry for his
[1:43:52] people. And then I once read you a
[1:43:55] scripture that speaks about
[1:43:59] uh the one that look after your
[1:44:06] soul. There's
[1:44:08] somebody that looks after your
[1:44:12] soul. Now this thing now they've got
[1:44:15] different levels.
[1:44:19] See? Amen. You are
[1:44:22] part of brother Brennham. Yeah, brother.
[1:44:26] Amen. You are part of that angel.
[1:44:30] You are part of your
[1:44:33] pastor. We are
[1:44:36] all sheep. It's it's in that lineage.
[1:44:40] You can't change it. Amen.
[1:44:45] Now what he
[1:44:46] says the
[1:44:48] men who teach that pyramid
[1:44:53] doctrine I
[1:44:55] guess they know what they are talking
[1:45:00] [Music]
[1:45:01] about. Then he says I know nothing about
[1:45:06] it. Now who taught us the
[1:45:09] pyramid? He went he went he went west to
[1:45:13] west to
[1:45:15] connect to the
[1:45:17] man right and when he came back he was
[1:45:21] another
[1:45:23] man taught the pyramid
[1:45:27] doctor amen right but he says I know now
[1:45:31] there's a part of you
[1:45:34] that knows
[1:45:37] nothing but there's a part of
[1:45:39] you that
[1:45:42] knows. Amen. That is why you are sitting
[1:45:46] here what brought you
[1:45:49] here is a part of
[1:45:52] you that knows.
[1:45:54] [Applause]
[1:45:56] Now the people that are not listening
[1:46:00] this
[1:46:03] morning or that are not live streaming
[1:46:06] this
[1:46:08] morning, they they can't be part of
[1:46:12] this. When that time
[1:46:15] comes, your part draws you to the other
[1:46:22] part. Are you together? And uh when uh
[1:46:26] uh uh uh the word is is is
[1:46:30] processed it it's the different
[1:46:35] parts communing.
[1:46:39] That is why now okay let's move
[1:46:42] on. However, but but however, it was the
[1:46:46] shape of a pyramid.
[1:46:53] But the cap on the
[1:46:55] pyramid was never put
[1:46:58] on as long as there still
[1:47:04] loopholes. The cap never came
[1:47:08] on because it was a cornerstone.
[1:47:15] It was a headstone
[1:47:19] in the church. It was a
[1:47:23] cornerstone. In the full
[1:47:25] church, it was a
[1:47:30] capstone
[1:47:32] cornerstone became
[1:47:34] the
[1:47:37] capstone. Amen.
[1:47:41] So it never came to the Jews.
[1:47:46] It was rejected.
[1:47:49] Amen. He came he he went to the Jews
[1:47:53] as the son of man and he was
[1:47:58] rejected. So the Jewish
[1:48:02] church had no
[1:48:06] capstone. That is why the
[1:48:09] capstone to the Jews will come after the
[1:48:15] rapture. The rejected
[1:48:19] cornerstone the
[1:48:21] Jews you will see him in the book of
[1:48:26] Zechariah. Right. Amen. Now before
[1:48:34] now we see uh the great tribulation
[1:48:38] after
[1:48:42] rapture. Those are the things that we
[1:48:44] need to understand.
[1:48:48] First turn their
[1:48:51] heart and then when you are
[1:48:54] settled then you get all the spiritual
[1:48:58] ingredients.
[1:49:04] Uh let's go to that very same uh what
[1:49:06] you call that that that that uh slide
[1:49:11] uh slide. Yeah.
[1:49:15] You see it says the title is the great
[1:49:18] tribulation
[1:49:20] after the
[1:49:23] rapture. So in order that there should
[1:49:25] be a
[1:49:27] rapture, there should be a
[1:49:31] ministry that will give you a rapturing
[1:49:37] faith. Right? Amen. There should be a
[1:49:40] ministry that will give
[1:49:42] you a rapturing faith.
[1:49:47] Right. Amen.
[1:49:51] Now, after the
[1:49:54] rapture, then it is the
[1:49:57] bride. That's why we say we're polishing
[1:49:59] it up. You know about
[1:50:04] it. Now it is the
[1:50:07] work and the
[1:50:10] commission of
[1:50:12] God to the
[1:50:14] pastors that they make
[1:50:17] sure that the
[1:50:20] bride will be
[1:50:22] raptured. It's not an
[1:50:28] issue is to give you what belongs to
[1:50:32] you.
[1:50:34] Right. Amen. And what belongs to you, it
[1:50:38] will work on itself.
[1:50:43] It's like when you've got a
[1:50:45] headache, you take maybe discipline
[1:50:49] or that discipline will work on
[1:50:52] it. You must receive it.
[1:50:58] So there is a
[1:51:00] ministry that will give
[1:51:07] That is what now the pastor is doing
[1:51:10] now. He has done
[1:51:13] everything. He went even beyond
[1:51:18] and touched the book of
[1:51:21] Enoch, right? Amen. Which is not in the
[1:51:25] Bible, but he will tell you that it's in
[1:51:28] the
[1:51:30] pyramid. It's in the zodiac.
[1:51:34] And it was before
[1:51:37] even Job.
[1:51:40] You see now? Amen. Now everything has
[1:51:43] been covered up.
[1:51:49] What we're doing is just ironing it
[1:51:53] up so that when you you miss it.
[1:52:00] Uh no miss it.
[1:52:05] when you miss it, it will be your fault.
[1:52:11] And then so that now you know it's it's
[1:52:14] it's the Bible says
[1:52:18] you will be
[1:52:20] judging your own
[1:52:24] sister, your own
[1:52:26] brother, your own
[1:52:28] cousin. You'll be taking your own sister
[1:52:33] to the lake of
[1:52:37] fire to show you that is not your
[1:52:41] sister. The real sister is this one
[1:52:45] that the other one is not your brother.
[1:52:50] You
[1:52:51] share the
[1:52:57] bloodiest but your
[1:53:01] reality is the eternal one.
[1:53:05] I don't say you must hate each
[1:53:07] other. Here on earth is your brother.
[1:53:11] Yes. Yes. But beyond
[1:53:16] uh that is why you need to cry for your
[1:53:19] brother right
[1:53:23] now. You need to cry for your relative
[1:53:25] right
[1:53:28] now. What will happen after
[1:53:33] rapture? There's no turning
[1:53:38] back. Right. Amen. So we're talking
[1:53:41] about after rapture
[1:53:43] is what what will happen
[1:53:47] after but we should know where is our
[1:53:53] ministry. Remember that
[1:53:56] now he came our ministry is the ministry
[1:54:00] of the son of man.
[1:54:05] He is now a son of man.
[1:54:09] And when God said to Ezekiel,
[1:54:13] "Son of man,
[1:54:16] what is the son of man?"
[1:54:20] It's God in a man.
[1:54:24] So our
[1:54:26] ministry is that of God in a man.
[1:54:33] But in our
[1:54:35] case, it's it's it's a revealed
[1:54:39] word like like what the Bible says in
[1:54:42] the book of John
[1:54:44] chapter 10 verse 35. Just just just
[1:54:47] let's go there. John 10:35. John 10:35.
[1:54:51] Amen.
[1:54:52] Now that that's where our ministry
[1:54:57] is. The their ministry, Jewish
[1:55:01] ministry was a man that you could point
[1:55:04] with a
[1:55:07] finger. Our
[1:55:09] ministry is the word that is in the
[1:55:16] man. Listen to what he says.
[1:55:19] If he called them
[1:55:24] gods, unto whom the word of God
[1:55:30] came and the scripture cannot be
[1:55:36] broken, if the word of
[1:55:39] God, now the ministry is of a son of
[1:55:43] man is the word that came unto you.
[1:55:49] In the beginning was the
[1:55:51] word. The word was with
[1:55:53] God. The word is God. The word was
[1:55:58] God. Are you together? Now if that the
[1:56:01] word that was that was
[1:56:05] God come to
[1:56:07] you, it make you a
[1:56:10] God. That is why that
[1:56:12] word came to
[1:56:15] Mary. When it it reaches the womb of
[1:56:19] man, it created a
[1:56:22] body of
[1:56:25] God. That is why God Bible says he's a
[1:56:31] spirit. He's a logos. But God has got a
[1:56:35] body.
[1:56:37] That is why the Bible says that very
[1:56:40] same
[1:56:42] Jesus, the very same
[1:56:44] Jesus, God has made
[1:56:48] him the Lord and
[1:56:52] Christ. So the day you meet
[1:56:55] him, you meet him in that
[1:56:58] body because he
[1:57:01] resurrected in in that body.
[1:57:05] Are we together?
[1:57:07] Now, if the
[1:57:11] word comes unto you
[1:57:14] and reveals itself unto you,
[1:57:19] it forms God.
[1:57:23] Right. Amen.
[1:57:25] Look, if you call them God, small
[1:57:31] G, unto whom the word of God, capital
[1:57:38] G, the scripture cannot be
[1:57:43] broken. Right? Amen. Remember the
[1:57:48] ministry of the son of man
[1:57:52] contain the opening of the seven semen.
[1:57:59] Right. Amen. The ministry of the seven
[1:58:04] se contained or or or the ministry of
[1:58:07] the son of man
[1:58:11] contains the opening of the
[1:58:15] seven. Amen. Amen. Now the third
[1:58:20] pool is the
[1:58:23] manifestation of the end time.
[1:58:28] When you when you when when you talk
[1:58:29] about the third
[1:58:30] pool, you talk about the manifested
[1:58:35] way, there's a
[1:58:38] promise, that word when is
[1:58:42] manifested, it's a third pool.
[1:58:46] So when you manifest the third
[1:58:51] pool is the
[1:58:53] word that you are
[1:58:57] promised being
[1:58:59] manifested. Amen. Right.
[1:59:03] Amen. If you check the Messiah
[1:59:09] during the the the the the Jews
[1:59:13] dispensation, you'll see what happened.
[1:59:17] During the time of the
[1:59:20] Messiah, the time of Jewish
[1:59:22] dispensation,
[1:59:27] uh, King Herod
[1:59:30] and and
[1:59:32] Pilot, Herod was the king of the
[1:59:37] Jews and that that is Herod and Pilot
[1:59:41] was the
[1:59:44] governor. They didn't they were not
[1:59:47] friends.
[1:59:51] They hated each other.
[1:59:54] But because of our Lord Jesus
[1:59:59] Christ, they joined
[2:00:01] hands. They became
[2:00:04] friends because of our Lord. Because
[2:00:06] they wanted to fight him.
[2:00:12] Look at what is going on in our
[2:00:16] time. Look at the
[2:00:19] churches. They have joined
[2:00:23] hands against the revealed
[2:00:26] [Applause]
[2:00:29] word. It it is very
[2:00:33] difficult to
[2:00:36] present the word at its standard.
[2:00:41] at any other
[2:00:44] church. You can't do that because it
[2:00:51] separates it. It it it even separates
[2:00:55] [Music]
[2:00:57] families. You know Jesus was separated
[2:01:01] from his own brothers.
[2:01:07] They will say to him, "Go and show
[2:01:11] yourself." But they they were saying,
[2:01:14] "Go so that they can kill
[2:01:19] you." You must read it. It says,
[2:01:23] "So, so they were separated."
[2:01:26] So the word of
[2:01:28] God when it is manifesting
[2:01:33] itself it cause
[2:01:36] separation
[2:01:38] because the things that are
[2:01:41] here are not exactly what God has
[2:01:45] ordained to be like
[2:01:52] that together.
[2:01:55] And you you you need to check the
[2:01:58] history
[2:02:02] and check what is happening
[2:02:06] uh when the word is
[2:02:09] manifested. You see when the word is
[2:02:14] manifested, it bends those that don't
[2:02:17] believe in it.
[2:02:21] and and and it exposed it
[2:02:27] exposed everybody that is against the
[2:02:30] true
[2:02:35] will at the end. It expose
[2:02:41] liars. It expose
[2:02:45] witches. It it it expose everything
[2:02:48] because it's light.
[2:02:53] So there's nothing that you you will
[2:02:58] hide regardless of what you are
[2:03:02] doing. You can't hide yourself from
[2:03:05] this. It's a
[2:03:08] lie and and
[2:03:11] everything that was not created by God.
[2:03:16] You know the prophet
[2:03:20] says there are things that crept at
[2:03:24] night and they bite people with those
[2:03:29] things. I don't know them in
[2:03:35] English. All those
[2:03:37] Yeah. I don't know in English my
[2:03:40] Yeah. They they creep up at
[2:03:43] night. He says no. They were not created
[2:03:46] by God. Why are they sucking
[2:03:51] blood? See, so they exposed. The prophet
[2:03:55] came and exposed. This does not come
[2:03:57] from
[2:04:00] [Applause]
[2:04:01] God like the trees that they've got
[2:04:06] thorns. He says, "No, they were not
[2:04:10] created. Devil is not a creator.
[2:04:15] Right. Amen. What he do? He take what
[2:04:19] you when God kicked him out of heaven.
[2:04:24] Remember God has gift gave him
[2:04:29] gifts. Great gifts. The devil had
[2:04:33] grieve. Like the singers
[2:04:36] here. They've got an
[2:04:38] organ. You've got the saxophone,
[2:04:41] saxophone, guitar,
[2:04:43] drums with the devil. It was all in him.
[2:04:46] All
[2:04:49] the whole symphony.
[2:04:52] And God never said, "No, because I'm
[2:04:55] chasing you out. Bring my
[2:04:59] things." He gave it to
[2:05:03] him. That is
[2:05:06] why is a musician
[2:05:10] must be very very very
[2:05:14] careful because the devil has got all
[2:05:16] those
[2:05:20] things. I was reading about John
[2:05:24] Todd. He was a a Jew a devil worshipper.
[2:05:31] He
[2:05:32] says most of the
[2:05:36] singers, they've just got the
[2:05:39] voice but they can't
[2:05:43] compose. So he
[2:05:45] said he gave an example about Carol
[2:05:48] King. those that knows Carol
[2:05:51] King, she's got a beautiful
[2:05:53] voice, wonderful
[2:05:56] melody, but you can't compose a
[2:06:00] song. So,
[2:06:03] witches composes a
[2:06:06] song in a witch
[2:06:09] language. When you read it, you read
[2:06:12] nice
[2:06:15] words. When you reverse
[2:06:17] it, it's a witch
[2:06:20] language. Then he says, you take that
[2:06:23] thing, you put it in your
[2:06:27] house, it causes a revolution in your
[2:06:31] [Music]
[2:06:32] house. It makes your children
[2:06:37] mad when it's
[2:06:40] playing. Uh the father will get mad at
[2:06:44] the children.
[2:06:48] and the mother will do funny
[2:06:51] things and the children because of
[2:06:55] that wi-i without even playing
[2:06:58] it just having the disc of that
[2:07:02] thing I'm just showing
[2:07:05] you that now
[2:07:07] God didn't take the gift of the
[2:07:11] devil he
[2:07:13] knew that He was going to make you
[2:07:19] God, let alone the
[2:07:22] gift. You will be
[2:07:25] God. So the devil cannot
[2:07:31] manipulate. The devil can never
[2:07:36] manipulate. He say, "Take the
[2:07:39] gifts, but these are my
[2:07:42] children. I'll give them off
[2:07:46] myself. So you become
[2:07:50] God. Amen. When when when Abraham
[2:07:54] Abraham was about to
[2:07:57] depart, he called Isaac
[2:08:01] and he called Ishmael.
[2:08:04] Those were his sons.
[2:08:08] So he gave gifts to Ishmael.
[2:08:13] riches and
[2:08:15] everything and gave
[2:08:18] Isaac
[2:08:21] all everything all. The other one is
[2:08:25] very
[2:08:26] rich. But Isaac has got
[2:08:30] all that's what God do. He gave us all
[2:08:34] of
[2:08:36] himself. When when he met
[2:08:39] Abraham, he didn't give him things bits
[2:08:42] and
[2:08:44] pieces. No, he gave him God.
[2:08:47] Amen. Now, that's what he did to his
[2:08:50] bride. He gave of
[2:08:55] himself. Remember, I haven't even
[2:08:59] touched what will happen after rapture.
[2:09:03] I just want to show
[2:09:05] you how important are
[2:09:10] you and how powerful are
[2:09:14] you and and you must
[2:09:17] never allow the
[2:09:20] devil to us what God has given
[2:09:26] you. It's yours. You must know that it's
[2:09:30] yours.
[2:09:32] and you must admonish
[2:09:35] it. The ministry of the seven
[2:09:39] seed, it makes you God.
[2:09:43] Just just
[2:09:46] imagine. Now you I was thinking about
[2:09:50] the new Jerusalem.
[2:09:55] uh one one of the you know these these
[2:09:58] children that are sitting
[2:09:59] here don't think that they don't
[2:10:03] hear one of them said to
[2:10:11] me teach me about an angel
[2:10:15] or about angels
[2:10:18] I said
[2:10:20] why said no you No, I don't want
[2:10:24] to uh doubt the angel when it comes to
[2:10:27] me and say who are you? I want to know
[2:10:30] the
[2:10:37] angel. Now the thing
[2:10:40] is in the
[2:10:43] supernatural it says uh in New
[2:10:48] Jerusalem you will travel
[2:10:50] like like your mind
[2:10:54] I just imagine when I want to visit our
[2:10:58] Lord Jesus
[2:11:00] Christ. I'm going to take
[2:11:04] Uber. No, I just think about him and
[2:11:07] then he'll be
[2:11:09] here. And when he wants me, he just
[2:11:13] think about
[2:11:14] me and then I'll be there. In the garden
[2:11:17] of Eden, when God was visiting Adam,
[2:11:23] he didn't come flying.
[2:11:26] No, Adam just saw him there and then and
[2:11:30] then they they
[2:11:32] commune. Can you gamble with such a
[2:11:36] life?
[2:11:42] where you will you if you want to go to
[2:11:45] any planet in the
[2:11:48] universe you are just there by thinking
[2:11:51] about
[2:11:53] no now can you
[2:11:56] uh waste your
[2:11:59] time where now you don't have to use
[2:12:02] Uber or
[2:12:05] retakes fine that's what is it Amen.
[2:12:08] Okay. Now, that's that's that that's
[2:12:11] where God wants us to be,
[2:12:16] taking us up to those type of
[2:12:21] dimensions. So, that is the don't take
[2:12:24] this ministry
[2:12:27] lightly. It's it's it's it's it's of his
[2:12:32] own. when when when
[2:12:37] Herod came together, it was
[2:12:41] because the great one was here.
[2:12:45] And when you see the
[2:12:47] world
[2:12:49] forming, they come
[2:12:52] together. You must know that the great
[2:12:54] ones,
[2:13:00] history, history and prophecies
[2:13:03] are being fulfilled.
[2:13:06] Now what is happening in the world?
[2:13:11] The superior general
[2:13:16] of the society of Jesus
[2:13:20] is now taking
[2:13:23] control. the general of the of the of
[2:13:26] the the Jesuits,
[2:13:30] if you don't know, is taking control.
[2:13:35] You saw the
[2:13:37] pope opening the
[2:13:41] doors? Why was he opening the
[2:13:44] door? And how many doors did he
[2:13:47] open? And he never closed those
[2:13:51] doors. The other popes
[2:13:54] open the
[2:13:56] doors and close
[2:13:58] them. This
[2:14:00] one hasn't closed.
[2:14:03] Ask yourself and ask yourself, what are
[2:14:07] those
[2:14:08] doors? Why why is it why is he opening
[2:14:12] the
[2:14:14] door right? Amen. Now you compare that
[2:14:18] with the river
[2:14:21] Euphrates. You compare that
[2:14:25] with a superior general
[2:14:28] and you compare that
[2:14:30] with this book here, Acts of the Holy
[2:14:34] Ghost,
[2:14:37] paragraph 87. Paragraph 87
[2:14:41] that was preached in
[2:14:43] 1954 1954.
[2:14:47] There's a prophecy there
[2:14:49] that speaks about that. You'll go and
[2:14:51] read it.
[2:14:53] I'm not going to tell you.
[2:14:56] Go and read it.
[2:15:00] Remember the devil came as an
[2:15:03] antichrist.
[2:15:06] Then he became a false
[2:15:09] prophet. I think I heard that that that
[2:15:13] slide. If you've got can can you can you
[2:15:16] display that slide
[2:15:20] where now he he he not that one where
[2:15:25] he is an
[2:15:29] antichrist a false
[2:15:32] prophet a
[2:15:34] v a
[2:15:36] beast you see amen remember now that
[2:15:40] after a
[2:15:41] rapture that beast will take
[2:15:45] control. Now he has he has formed that
[2:15:49] thing. It's it's one and the same
[2:15:52] thing. Then from when when you see
[2:15:58] him mobilizing the whole
[2:16:02] world, you must know that there's a
[2:16:05] great
[2:16:06] one that is standing
[2:16:09] by. There's a great one that mobilize
[2:16:13] from
[2:16:16] eternity. The devil will mobilize from
[2:16:18] the
[2:16:19] world. Oh, it will
[2:16:24] mobilize.
[2:16:26] So,
[2:16:27] remember there's what we
[2:16:30] called the
[2:16:32] investigating judgment angels.
[2:16:42] Now, brother
[2:16:44] Brenman spoke about
[2:16:48] wormwood. He said wood is in control of
[2:16:52] the
[2:16:55] waters. I said to you, we're just
[2:16:57] polishing
[2:16:59] up is in
[2:17:01] control of the water. He's the one that
[2:17:06] destroyed the whole
[2:17:07] world during the time of
[2:17:10] Noah. Look at what is happening now
[2:17:14] about the
[2:17:15] fires, about the waters. The
[2:17:19] investigating judgment angel
[2:17:24] is all these years we never had such
[2:17:28] fire.
[2:17:30] All these years we never had a nature
[2:17:34] that is
[2:17:38] struggling. Right now there's something
[2:17:41] that's happening in the
[2:17:46] nature. It shows
[2:17:48] you that now even what God has
[2:17:53] created it's
[2:17:55] performing. This is not how God put me
[2:17:58] to
[2:18:01] be.
[2:18:03] Everybody takes his own
[2:18:06] direction. He's pulled from where he he
[2:18:09] is
[2:18:12] established. Right? Amen. So now you you
[2:18:15] will you will read that that quote.
[2:18:20] But now let me just jump a little bit.
[2:18:24] Remember that. Now
[2:18:26] We spoke about behold I'll send you
[2:18:29] Elijah the
[2:18:32] prophet. Now we are gathered together.
[2:18:36] And after we gathered
[2:18:38] together the voice of our Lord the
[2:18:43] voice if you look at those spoken words
[2:18:46] we are we are
[2:18:48] having it's muted but in the days of the
[2:18:52] voice
[2:18:56] Right. Amen. And the prophet says is the
[2:19:00] same voice
[2:19:02] that raised Lazarus.
[2:19:06] There's life in that
[2:19:09] voice. He said in John 663, I love that
[2:19:15] scripture. The words that I
[2:19:18] speak, they are spirit and they
[2:19:23] are right. Amen. So the prophet says is
[2:19:27] the same voice
[2:19:30] that raised Lazarus.
[2:19:35] Right. Amen. Now uh the pyramid pyramid
[2:19:42] has reached a point
[2:19:45] where it should quicken.
[2:19:51] There's relevant things that are
[2:19:53] happening. Now when I'm talking about
[2:19:55] relevant
[2:19:57] things about the things that has to
[2:20:01] do with the time you they are relevant.
[2:20:07] that
[2:20:08] that I
[2:20:10] happen and the first thing is the
[2:20:14] manifestation of the
[2:20:16] word. The second thing is the
[2:20:19] manifestation of the
[2:20:22] promises. Remember the word of the
[2:20:25] Lord is here to give us a divine
[2:20:31] nature according to uh the second book
[2:20:35] of
[2:20:37] Peter. Verse four says, "Now God gave us
[2:20:43] promises that will give us a divine
[2:20:47] nature. Our
[2:20:49] nature has
[2:20:51] changed to that of a
[2:20:55] divine right. Amen. You you you watch
[2:20:58] the behavior of the
[2:21:02] people. It's either they are
[2:21:06] extremists on the on the
[2:21:11] negative or
[2:21:13] extremist on the positive.
[2:21:18] There's nothing that they can
[2:21:20] do. It's how they
[2:21:23] are. When our Lord Jesus Christ was was
[2:21:27] about to be
[2:21:30] crucified, you look at the
[2:21:35] reaction. You look at the spirit of that
[2:21:39] time. He will say,
[2:21:41] "Tonight is the night." You will be
[2:21:45] disappointed and look at their
[2:21:48] reaction. Look at
[2:21:50] Peter. You look at the other
[2:21:54] disciples. Then you will
[2:21:56] see whether they look Peter said, "Thou
[2:22:00] art the
[2:22:01] Christ, the son of the living God." God
[2:22:04] gave him a
[2:22:06] key. Right? He gave him a key.
[2:22:09] Immediately he received that key.
[2:22:12] The angel of the devil was upon
[2:22:15] him until Jesus Christ says, "Get thee
[2:22:19] behind me.
[2:22:21] You when he was uh he when when when
[2:22:25] they were taking
[2:22:27] communion, look at the reaction of of
[2:22:31] Judas. He was
[2:22:33] shivering because the time has
[2:22:36] come that he should fulfill who he was.
[2:22:40] Look at the time that you are living in.
[2:22:43] You see people
[2:22:45] shivering. The time has
[2:22:47] come. You know Judas was aware that I've
[2:22:53] got funny
[2:22:56] anointing. And look at our Lord Jesus
[2:22:59] Christ. He was relaxed. He said, "I have
[2:23:04] appointed you and I have chosen you
[2:23:08] being 12, but one of you and the one of
[2:23:13] you
[2:23:14] knew was pointing at
[2:23:17] me." He was
[2:23:19] shivering
[2:23:21] spiritually and the devil was looking at
[2:23:24] his
[2:23:25] position. Now he's about to descend.
[2:23:30] That's why I'm quoting the generals of
[2:23:32] the Jesuits. That's why
[2:23:34] I'm quoting what the the world is doing
[2:23:40] now. You look at the World Council of
[2:23:43] Jesus. You look at the United Nations.
[2:23:46] You look at what whatever is
[2:23:49] happening. You look at the
[2:23:52] man when when when the rapture come go
[2:23:55] go go go go go go go go go go go go go
[2:23:55] go go go go go go goes
[2:23:57] up the devil will be
[2:23:59] descended look at at that
[2:24:02] man who the devil will will descend on
[2:24:07] you I don't want to call
[2:24:09] names but I've quoted
[2:24:14] names but if if you are
[2:24:17] spiritual you will know exactly where
[2:24:19] the devil
[2:24:21] [Music]
[2:24:24] And look at the reaction
[2:24:27] there. Are we together? Right. Quickly
[2:24:31] now I've got about 15 minutes. Let's
[2:24:33] let's save that.
[2:24:35] H let's display that in
[2:24:39] uh yeah that is the that's the
[2:24:42] one. Okay. After the rapture.
[2:24:45] Now I've I've already spoke about
[2:24:48] things before the
[2:24:51] rapture. Now the Bible
[2:24:54] it speaks about
[2:24:57] Gog and
[2:25:00] that is in Ezekiel 38.
[2:25:03] What will happen there? We'll just give
[2:25:05] a brief
[2:25:07] explanation and then read some few
[2:25:11] scriptures. Now what is happening now?
[2:25:15] Gork,
[2:25:17] you must go and check who
[2:25:21] in Genesis chapter 10, you'll find all
[2:25:24] those names.
[2:25:28] Now Gog, okay, Noah. Noah after uh after
[2:25:35] God destroyed the world, I mean the the
[2:25:38] the the Yeah. the the the the earth with
[2:25:41] water.
[2:25:43] It was Noah that
[2:25:46] was it was Noah his three sons and their
[2:25:52] wives people eight people were were left
[2:25:56] it was him and
[2:26:00] Jafet right now
[2:26:05] and Jaff they started spreading
[2:26:10] with their families
[2:26:12] In the olden days,
[2:26:15] uh people were uh the names
[2:26:21] of the
[2:26:24] tribes comes from the great
[2:26:30] grandfather and even
[2:26:33] places. You will read in in Genesis
[2:26:36] 10is that now
[2:26:39] Gog was a
[2:26:42] name of one of the
[2:26:45] children of the grandchildren of Noah.
[2:26:50] As they move on, they found a place.
[2:26:54] That's why the Bible says go
[2:26:58] and it speaks about the prince of the
[2:27:00] land.
[2:27:04] When you I've I've displayed a lot of of
[2:27:07] of slides
[2:27:09] there. One day I I remember showing you
[2:27:14] that Russia Russia is called
[2:27:18] Gog. that
[2:27:20] Moscow is called
[2:27:22] Mish it used to
[2:27:25] be and that is why the prophet said
[2:27:30] watch Russia
[2:27:32] king of the
[2:27:34] north that is what the prophet said it's
[2:27:37] not me got quotes I can show
[2:27:40] you because of time he said watch
[2:27:44] Russia king of the north and then if you
[2:27:48] want to
[2:27:50] Check what is going on in the
[2:27:53] Vatican. Check what is going on in
[2:27:57] Russia. Check what is going on in
[2:28:00] America because there's a
[2:28:04] prophet from
[2:28:07] uh the
[2:28:08] prophet. Even the code that I've just
[2:28:11] given you,
[2:28:14] it's it's it's a code that it's a
[2:28:18] prophecy
[2:28:19] that was prophesy in 1954.
[2:28:25] Okay. But now you all know that uh Gog
[2:28:29] and Mog
[2:28:32] of Ezekiel Ezekiel 38 38 speaks about
[2:28:38] the kings of the
[2:28:44] east will be attacking Israel.
[2:28:50] You know the commotion now is you go
[2:28:52] look at the
[2:28:54] east look what is going
[2:28:57] on. I I I don't want to quote
[2:29:01] countries but they are
[2:29:03] there you can see them that now there is
[2:29:08] a commotion there
[2:29:11] is there's a war there's
[2:29:15] fighting why what are they fighting for
[2:29:19] they are fighting for uh there's a city
[2:29:22] called
[2:29:25] Jerusalem that's where Abraham
[2:29:28] Abraham
[2:29:31] met that's where now new
[2:29:34] Jerusalem when it descends it will land
[2:29:37] there.
[2:29:39] Now new Jerusalem
[2:29:41] is not a city like
[2:29:44] Pritori. No no there won't be any sea.
[2:29:50] The Bible says see
[2:29:53] it will stretch. Just just just to give
[2:29:56] you an
[2:29:58] example one
[2:30:00] side could stretch from
[2:30:04] me to right at Cape
[2:30:08] Town right in the Atlantic
[2:30:11] Ocean one side
[2:30:14] only then make that thing
[2:30:19] square that that that will be the
[2:30:23] sea right. Amen. But the
[2:30:26] headquarters, the headquarters will be
[2:30:29] God himself.
[2:30:31] No more
[2:30:33] light. There's quite a lot of things.
[2:30:36] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Now what
[2:30:39] they are fighting for is that now when
[2:30:42] he
[2:30:43] descends, he will come
[2:30:45] there. So they want to occupy that
[2:30:49] place. There was a time where they were
[2:30:52] even making a me missile.
[2:30:56] say no when when when Jesus
[2:30:59] come coming with a child they're going
[2:31:02] to shoot him.
[2:31:05] Now it's it's on the super Luke. We say
[2:31:07] it's the end of
[2:31:10] time. Now end of time is that now the
[2:31:14] time will
[2:31:16] end. Now starts another another to start
[2:31:20] another
[2:31:23] dispensation. Now in that
[2:31:25] dispensation it will be the
[2:31:27] devil that is ruling
[2:31:31] this so-called world.
[2:31:36] the devil himself will be the one that
[2:31:38] is in
[2:31:40] control there only one ruler
[2:31:46] and
[2:31:47] then that's why
[2:31:49] now your your your your way of
[2:31:54] worship it should be you should be
[2:31:56] worshiping the devil
[2:31:59] there's no Holy Ghost what what what
[2:32:01] what what gives us power
[2:32:04] is that when we pray, we feel the
[2:32:07] anointing
[2:32:10] and and when we read the Bible, we feel
[2:32:13] the anointing
[2:32:16] and then the Bible says, he he brings
[2:32:19] the the the the
[2:32:22] understanding in in Ephesians
[2:32:25] 1:17, he give us a spirit that we should
[2:32:29] understand and should we have knowledge,
[2:32:32] but After
[2:32:36] this, no
[2:32:38] anointing, no
[2:32:40] revelation, no
[2:32:42] power, no Holy
[2:32:44] Ghost. You just try to read and you are
[2:32:48] not even allowed to
[2:32:50] read. Are we together? Amen. Those are
[2:32:53] the things that will be h happening
[2:32:55] during that
[2:32:57] time. I haven't touched
[2:33:00] them. We've got only 5 minutes.
[2:33:03] But the Lord willing, one
[2:33:05] day the pastor might touch them or I can
[2:33:10] touch them. But let's go to that one
[2:33:12] just so that you could go through. I've
[2:33:14] got five minutes to go.
[2:33:18] You see there's a time when there will
[2:33:23] be the war
[2:33:25] and I've just I was just reading it. the
[2:33:27] time does not allow
[2:33:29] me. God will attack
[2:33:33] Russia and then God
[2:33:35] says I will defend
[2:33:39] them defend. That's what he says. He
[2:33:43] says I I
[2:33:45] myself. I will I will defend them.
[2:33:49] Right. Amen.
[2:33:52] He says
[2:33:54] uh they shall come from thy place out of
[2:33:57] the uh the north
[2:34:04] parts and then it says it shall be in I
[2:34:07] don't want to give you the verses
[2:34:08] because it will it shall be in the
[2:34:11] latter
[2:34:13] days. Now the latter days the final
[2:34:20] period before the
[2:34:23] end. Amen. Are we are we are we
[2:34:26] together? Oh maybe if you want to
[2:34:27] display it my brother display verse 16.
[2:34:31] Verse 16.
[2:34:34] Verse 16. You see what it says here and
[2:34:38] verse 16. And it shall be in the latter
[2:34:43] days. Vers 17. Verse 17. The last
[2:34:47] part it says, I'll bring thee against
[2:34:51] them.
[2:34:56] You go. I will bring you
[2:35:00] and more. Verse 18. Verse 18. The
[2:35:03] last words
[2:35:07] there h it says that my fury shall come
[2:35:11] upon in my face.
[2:35:19] Verse 19. Verse 19, it says the last
[2:35:23] words. Surely in that day there shall be
[2:35:26] a great
[2:35:30] shaking in the in the land of Israel.
[2:35:35] Let's go back to the slide again.
[2:35:40] So then thereafter
[2:35:44] uh before
[2:35:45] actually then comes the the time of
[2:35:49] tribulation where
[2:35:51] John where Elijah and
[2:35:54] Moses will be
[2:35:56] preaching. Remember we said eh the the
[2:36:00] the the
[2:36:01] [Music]
[2:36:03] the pyramid of the Jews
[2:36:09] was not kept.
[2:36:12] So now John and Moses will bring this
[2:36:16] very same
[2:36:17] ministry but they will start from
[2:36:21] Pentecost on and on
[2:36:23] on the capstone.
[2:36:28] When they are finished, there's a
[2:36:30] scripture in in Revelation chapter 11,
[2:36:36] they will be killed,
[2:36:38] laid for 12 days, I mean for three
[2:36:41] days and that that very same voice that
[2:36:44] raised
[2:36:45] Lazarus will call them
[2:36:48] out. When you call them up and then they
[2:36:52] will
[2:36:53] resurrect when they were dead.
[2:36:57] people will be uh very very
[2:37:01] happy because they hated
[2:37:04] them but they will call them then after
[2:37:07] he called them they will
[2:37:10] preach and then 144
[2:37:15] I'm I'm just rushing would see them but
[2:37:19] the verse that I want us to read it's in
[2:37:22] Zechariah Zechariah chapter 12 that's my
[2:37:24] last verse Zechariah
[2:37:27] 12 after
[2:37:30] they were called
[2:37:33] and after the 144 144,000 has repented
[2:37:39] go to Zechariah
[2:37:42] chapter
[2:37:44] uh
[2:37:46] 12 Zechariah 12 Zechariah 12 verse 10
[2:37:50] let's read it in truth
[2:37:56] You got it.
[2:37:58] Start from verse
[2:38:00] 10. Zechariah 12 from verse
[2:38:04] 10. And I will pour upon the house of
[2:38:07] David and upon the inhabitants of
[2:38:10] Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of
[2:38:13] supplications.
[2:38:15] And they shall look upon me whom they
[2:38:17] have pierced. And they shall mourn for
[2:38:20] him as one mourneth for his only son,
[2:38:24] and shall be in bitterness for him, as
[2:38:27] one that is in bitterness for his
[2:38:29] firstborn. Amen. 11. In that day shall
[2:38:33] there be a great mourning in Jerusalem,
[2:38:36] as the morning of Hard Rimmon, in the
[2:38:40] valley of Megiddon.
[2:38:42] And the land shall mourn, every family
[2:38:45] apart, the family of the house of David
[2:38:48] apart, and their wives apart. The family
[2:38:52] of the house of Nathan apart, and their
[2:38:54] wives apart. Yeah.
[2:38:57] 13. Just read up to 14. The family of
[2:39:00] the house of Levy apart and their wives
[2:39:02] apart. The family of Sheiml apart and
[2:39:06] their wives apart. All the families that
[2:39:09] remain every family apart and their
[2:39:12] wives apart. Amen. So yeah, one day we
[2:39:16] will explain it in full.
[2:39:20] That is just to say to you,
[2:39:25] get up your
[2:39:29] loins and know that you've got greater
[2:39:33] things that end.
[2:39:39] And if you
[2:39:40] fail and busy playing
[2:39:44] about know what are the
[2:39:51] consequences, make
[2:39:53] sure that you are serious in the word of
[2:39:57] God and you
[2:40:00] understand and you've got the
[2:40:04] revelation and uh you are aware that you
[2:40:07] are
[2:40:09] going and if you are not sure
[2:40:15] God bless you.
[2:40:18] [Applause]
[2:40:23] Amen.
[2:40:25] There's a song that says going home and
[2:40:29] I'm going home.

[2:44:16] elder. We are indeed
[2:44:20] blessed. I'm going to

[2:46:29] the
[2:46:33] rapture. Our elder

[2:46:57] tribulation is so angry.
[2:47:09] from this
[2:47:16] ministry to stop them.
[2:47:19] because they've got power
[2:47:21] inside. Because when you said greater is
[2:47:24] he that is in me than the one who is in
[2:47:27] the world, that greater one is pulling
[2:47:32] your
[2:47:33] children. They've got an an unstoppable
