Title: Everything That Was Created Has An End II
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 30 July 2023 at ESwatini

Ephesians 4: 30     Ephesians 1: 6 - 7  Revelation 4: 1- 2 Revelation 7:10; Genesis 19:27

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience that everything that was created, has a beginning and has an end.

There are people in this age who are walking with God before the rapture. The sign of the rapture is with this people, they are the word of God made manifest. They are not in any church age but they are in Him. The last days of Enoch, he walked with God.  This are the people that Satan can not stop, because they are on the run way.

We should know if he is in us or not. This is the day to know, because if he is in you he doesn't change.

to pray for the reading of the word you may be seated foreign and I am going to take you back to that part that we have we have read last weekend I think you still remember the part in my book here I'm looking for the book if it is not here the brothers will just give it to me from there I will carry on without the books God bless you while the brother is going for the book I'm going to read some things out for you amen amen I read from the book the unveiling of God I said to the brother will continue with the message that we preached last weekend meet last Sunday yes last weekend I think you still remember the message last weekend yeah now the book says holy spirit of God Amen uh we're going to take it here as soon as we received the book amen amen I've been wondering at something I was talking about it even last night it's something that makes me wonder sometimes and ask myself what is happening really it is because of the the time that we are living in yeah something is happening that the people do not see and it is the last thing to happen to happen amen amen they will simply display it on the board here the quotation by quotations open for I will ask you to read out the quotation you remember that we used to we have used the same quotation last Sunday yeah you'll remember that everything that was created [Music] as an end foreign I was just supposed to say it but I want them to read it out of the book [Applause] creation in that God was not created so were we not Foods we were not created foreign [Applause] I think that's why we can read the Times that we are living in and we we can understand [Applause] there was something I wanted to understand because there's something that is happening and the people don't see it [Applause] amen there was a time when God showed us that there is this what we we called and underworld activities foreign and right now when we were in Congo that other week [Applause] um it was in the evening time when I received a phone call from South Africa here in South Africa as some other children were attacked foreign [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] the brother was was there was listening Brothers if you can't make it I will quote it don't worry amen amen and so on my brother my sister was just close to me when we battle uh those beasts [Music] [Applause] it happened one time when I was also in Malawi yeah I had to leave the pulpit yeah and go there into the office of the pasta then because there were some attacks here in South Africa [Applause] but then I'm glad that now I understand Singapore okay this morning we'll come back to that [Applause] because anything that had a beginning is a creation yes [Music] is this the thing the thing I mentioned that is just the part I wanted to read God bless you you can now relax foreign it says we are sealed until the day of redemption [Applause] means all the way we were sealed until the day of redemption meaning that Satan could do nothing to us until the day of redemption now it's referring to the seventh seal if you come back because as long as the seventh seal is not revealed um means and doing what he is doing is not revealed [Applause] but when the seal is revealed that's why the Bible says and when it was opened in heaven in heaven it was guava silence because it's a tool because it's a mystery now let's read it let's read here now last week we picked up this part here it says we are in him foreign and it says it's accumulating uh it is no more a way you know we we have gone through this last weekend [Applause] now now it's a really and I was reading this morning where the Bible says the bride and the spirit and the bread say come yeah um meaning that the spirit and the bright now are saying the same thing amen amen [Applause] over is seven Church age is over there will quote it [Music] that that future home of the bride and what's really bright and the bread amen now now and you I read also the book of The Rapture that's 20 chapter it says itsy speaks of the Rapture yeah [Applause] I don't want to say things without the reading out of the book but it tells us that is this is the last Church age this is the seventh Church age the other ages are yeah they are in the sixth Dimension she says they are waiting for those that are in that are coming from the seventh Church age amen amen now let's read this now okay do you have it brother the the rapture important amen God bless you all right now here we are the book of The Rapture page 20. in my feelings [Music] just like in the time of Enoch General enochino the Bible says the seventh man from Adam and we realized that brother brand name is the seventh angel messenger from Paul William [Applause] the seventh types this age [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] are in Alabama right here working with God before the Rapture these people actually are the word of God be made manifest [Applause] they are not in a church age now they are in him [Applause] he was in him is that enough yes the last days he has spent these last days he was working with God you know he was like on the runway just like a plane before it takes off you see it first on the runway [Music] and you can't stop it now the white people don't mind me because it is on the runway [Applause] now I see the people today the people living Satan cannot stop because they are on the runway [Applause] says potentially the Rapture is already in them [Applause] he that is out in my heart the time is over amen amen even if we can come into prayer line it doesn't work for salvation [Applause] because the pride is already on the runway you know when it is it is announced once it is it's all over even if you've got money you you can't buy you you can't book s it's on the runway now I have noticed that there are people even here on the runway no more turning back [Applause] they need they don't need salvation they are already in [Applause] they don't need to be prayed for about them for the Rapture potentially the Rapture is already in them [Applause] do you believe that we have them here right here the people that are going [Applause] and the one who is Left Behind there's no more Revival to come there's nothing that will come to revive [Applause] what was to be revived was revived the service close the service I read from this book here over a perfect man [Applause] is now suppose that is Page 14. the church is now supposed to be taking the place of Jesus Christ amen amen and you know if you if Christ is the mystery of God revealed you understand it doesn't say Jesus [Applause] is the mystery of God revealed because Jesus is this Earthly name it says Christ stands for the anointing if they say you are Christ alike that means you are anointed but the anointing we are talking about was back there when as the prophet says the rainbows foreign but it was from the that Fountain of the rainbow the Fountain of Life the Fountain of Life now he say is it when you he was a rainbow yes you were in that rainbow [Applause] then when it was logos yes logos when he became men he made you a man now you you came through the systems of God then when he was a man yet he couldn't sing foreign he couldn't sin because in him was that rainbow [Applause] and now when he was here on Earth he came to manifesta [Applause] what he was [Music] and to indwell his people so he has indulged you that's why you can't sin amen amen uh those data ancestral ity [Music] they will remain ancestral [Laughter] and the end of it they will start flying with brooms and so forth they can't change themselves from being ancestral [Applause] but those that are Eternal remain eternal [Applause] they can't change themselves change themselves and become ancestral now I have watched these days that these two forces and they're predestinated and they're predestinated amen you have the answers and they're predestinated [Applause] now let's read the sermon of today for 15 minutes reading from this book future home yeah uh seven days because we have now passed the seventh day it is having passed the seventh day then you are now in eternity [Applause] is where you was all the time [Applause] but you have just recognized it now he says he says this now uh you have passed that is Page 31. you have passed into eternity where you come from [Applause] us you was there to begin with amen by the time he preached this message he meant that you have passed [Applause] eternity why yeah now he says if you've got eternal life there's only one from form of eternal life that is God now what you are you are an expressed attitude attribute [Applause] all right now I'm going to talk to the people that are working with God [Applause] [Music] somebody else will never hear it [Applause] amen amen we are talking to the people that are working with God okay now he continues to say seven days cannot be counted with the weak [Applause] you count seven days you've got to come back in you've got to come back again yeah foreign [Music] the future [Music] he calls the scripture Ephesians chapter 1 verse 10. [Laughter] what did this it say s [Applause] okay just do just a bit Amen in the fullness it says dispensation carry on [Applause] the fullness [Applause] he he might gather together together [Applause] one and the wind all things in Christ [Applause] now let's separate things in the fullness of time after the seventh day of this past are we still waiting for the not ice no it has done passed and that's why he said to John [Applause] and I will show you things [Applause] that will come that is Revelation chapter 4. what did it say yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and then [Applause] [Music] okay amen amen now that is after the seven Church ages [Applause] when John was summoned to come to come up from their seven churches meaning that if then we have passed the seventh day um God has someone us to come up [Applause] for we are beyond the ages pyramid sometimes says a mountain speaks of seven steps to God [Applause] that is the pyramid [Applause] that's why the church is likened unto the pyramid pyramid amen now this pyramidal church it shows that as we are looking to the change you can see where the church is amen right now that's why I said even in uh recently I think we were abroad in Tanzania I said a thing like we are not a church a message Church [Applause] you hear about the message churches [Applause] [Music] I only have heard about the bride of Christ [Applause] because once once becomes churches [Applause] then every church has a spirit [Applause] it becomes spirits [Applause] [Applause] that's why we are not churches we are the bread of Christ amen with one Spirit that's why the Bible says the spirit and the bride says amen [Laughter] exactly saying every time saying the same thing yeah the prophet don't say something and the bride something else [Applause] you watch the brother she will never say something contrary to the prophet are we also also aim for the company and she will never say something contrary to the wedding [Applause] that is the bride now if you've got eternal life I've gone through that I've gone through that the book of Ephesians speak of the fullness of time let's hear again when the fullness of time has come yeah what will happen [Applause] [Music] okay and when the fullness of time has come yes amen peace that one the future home of the Bride okay it says the fullness of time and when the fullness of time has come when is it that's when when we are beyond the seventh Church age that is the fullness of time because the seven churches speaks of time that's why it's said to John John come up [Applause] [Applause] seven days [Music] [Applause] which it doesn't represent eternity it tells us that we came through time and at the end of time [Applause] that's when we really see who you are at the end of time you know after the seven Church ages you can see the colors of all things you can see who you are the people you have known after the church is the seventh churches they are no longer the same as the way because [Applause] um the seventh has caused a huge separation people are separated while even coming together in to worship [Applause] [Applause] oh okay now now let me read it here because it says here we are not praying for it but we have passed into eternity [Applause] amen I don't need to join a prayer line for eternity [Music] even if you are sick if you believe you have faith you will never come to the prayer line if you have faith in God [Applause] hallelujah did you read that book uh perfect Faith let me repeat you some something here again of God says if you have perfect Faith what do you want in the prayer line amen today what you see what they call revivals is just a bit of the word [Applause] they just say ah something about God then is prayer prayer like prayer line prayer life now I read the fullness of time when the fullness of time has come that's when time was being fulfilled yeah [Applause] I would find myself finding nothing because when their time is fulfilled [Music] when the time has been fulfilled it amen you'll find nothing [Applause] like God said that to the children of Israel [Applause] on the seventh day yes you will find nothing that means after the seventh day yeah you have went out for the day oh yeah beyond the seventh day it's [Applause] eternity [Applause] that's why now eternity is not something that you pray foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] as efficient so we were chosen where in him before the foundation of the world we were not chosen in the church we were chosen in him this is personal [Applause] [Applause] to the religionists a religion is somebody who can talk about God [Applause] but yet he is not in him [Applause] because real Christianity that's when he is in you and you are in him you really don't talk about him he talks about himself when in you [Applause] the gospel we preach is from within lesson even this book tells you that the throne can only be seen from the inside amen [Music] so we are going to the throne Button as we are we were coming through the pyramids traveling Within then that's why he says you can see the throne from outside but [Applause] we who are in here in Christ in Christ baptized in him we are partakers of his glory [Applause] but not on the outside I know on the outside somebody on the outside is still looking and denying it I read so now we are invited in into him to be partakers [Applause] because you are a particular not in the classroom but in him [Applause] so that's why he says now we are invited into him you know you don't talk about the seventh seal the seventh seal now the people say the seventh seal is not revealed only an outsider can say that why because the books it is opened in a three-fold yes [Applause] what does that means now we can go back to it a bit the people don't do here with their ears but they really can grasp it spiritually what is the threefold you see because he said at that day you shall know that Lord I am I am [Applause] [Music] yeah you're talking about the threefold foreign quickly [Applause] Jesus said at that day I'm trying to put you on this plane uh it is he said it is not revealed to the public now a public right because it says it is revealed in a three-fold yes [Applause] Jesus said at that day then here it says this day meaning that he was referring to this day [Applause] when the Revelation is made known you will know the father you will know that and the father in me and the i in you now [Applause] right amen now you take it back [Applause] it was God the logos the men the men [Applause] God the logos the men now these three folded that's the one that will know about the seventh seal [Applause] is not the public foreign [Applause] [Music] Christ is the mystery of God rebelled at that day which day in this day I mean amen this was set many years ago now you know if the sins we don't count yes oh man [Applause] now that means at that day that means this day what is today foreign oh you don't know what is today okay but that is this day brother [Applause] poetry at that day and that's this day [Applause] he was referring to this day [Applause] since it is revealed it's all the way that day [Applause] then it continues when this Revelation is made known [Applause] made known by whom then you will know you listen to the language here yeah and that day you know when you you will know when working then it continues that I am in you meaning that when he is in you you know that something that something in me amen [Applause] oh my I think you understand it brother that day you shall know meaning that one more thing even now seated there [Applause] you know it [Applause] you know when he is in you but there's something mysterious some person don't know when he is not in him but if he is in you you know because Paul says nevertheless I live but not I probably living in me it's not of myself [Applause] then Paul knew that he was an apostle and he knew that there was somebody in him and that somebody was not tall but it was God himself in Paul then he knew it you know today whether he is in you or not alive amen because you should know whether he is in you or not but he said he said I think this is the day to know yeah [Applause] because if he is in you he doesn't change [Applause] you are a Christian yesterday today forever we are a Christian you know I always thank God that he is has made me to be him oh yeah amen that's why he took our part he wanted us not just to be worshipers he came in order to indwell us [Applause] because Christianity [Applause] not religion now that's why the message Christianity from religion [Applause] because Christianity it's not a religion religion is just a sound about God foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] Paul says nevertheless I live [Applause] because he knew he knew himself when he was Paul and soul he was sold but now Paul knew that I'm no longer Soul there's somebody living in me and that one is not soul is Christ Living in me [Applause] okay at that day you shall know we are walking but the Wonder of it all here The Wonder of it all um that is this day [Music] [Applause] now we will close knowing that that day is is which day meaning there's no other day [Applause] when the book was opened not [Applause] if not the holy ghosts for you are still until [Applause] you run short of money [Applause] no it doesn't say until maybe uh you are in trouble [Music] um until you lack of normal [Music] no until the day of redemption [Applause] the day of redemption is opened that is the day of LOL because your name was put in a book Emma young boy until the day of redemption [Applause] amen amen no we are waiting for the Redemption of our bodies [Applause] we are redeemed our souls redeemed already [Applause] but we are waiting for the Redemption of our body okay [Applause] you don't find your Redemption on a prayer line before the foundation of the world [Applause] and when we were born Sinners [Music] the book was there on the throne our names appeared on that book [Applause] amen amen the Lord Jesus that form of a man to come for Redemption to redeem us now that's why after he has done the work the book was opened he took the book because John John looked for one uh who was waiting to open the book now as long as the book is not opened [Applause] we were still waiting until day of redemption when the book was reopened now if you say I'm redeemed you are saying after the book was opened meaning you have seen your name there I [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I I see this let me finish now [Applause] Jesus said at that day [Applause] that's this day this is Page Six Day Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says that's when this Revelation when this Revelation is made known because we were still there coming in closing now listen to this I'm still here with this threefold so long it says it is not opened to the public [Applause] then who is the public believe it because it speaks of that it is open in a three-fold [Music] and the prophet says the only way to know him you will receive this threefold Revelation three full Revelation what do you receive [Applause] is you are part of him yeah there's nothing he's before Sodom now he said shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do means you couldn't hide because Abraham being part of him [Music] before he can bend so Dome [Applause] Abraham must know about it before the tribulation period right he has to know about it amen amen you see right now what are you looking at [Music] um if you are talking about the future I will ask you which future according to description [Applause] today it is according to the word of God [Applause] and when you see Rivers you know that is the time for the kings of the East to come down and it is dry already [Applause] the only thing even the scientists [Music] there just to listen to the what they hear from down the caves [Music] [Applause] they come there to the dry river Euphrates and they hear some sounds foreign foreign because immediately after the Rapture everybody is the Tribulation period but what we are looking at now is the Tribulation period that is coming down it is just around the corner here [Applause] for it to happen but praise God [Applause] the bride of Christ shall be raptured first [Applause] and when she goes up the Devil comes down and what did the Bible say about it Revelation chapter 7 verse 10 . [Applause] telling us about that time yes when the bride will be in glory and I know that after God has spoken to Abraham before he could Bend Sodom he took Abraham and showed him because before that he said shall I hide from Abraham [Music] before the tribulation period is the seventh sign the seventh sign the seventh sign he saw the smoke [Applause] America burning in America burning and I was looking at it just before I started off for uh [Applause] here for here amen amen they were talking about America being so like a Gomorrah is [Applause] and he saw it burning is amen amen now imagine me and the brothers I have a brother at home we see sit down and we are looking at these things we saw it we look at it it will be a matter of time come and discussion yes when it will come up the smoke will be will come up from that place they call it Sodom they say it is like Gomorrah but if God took Abraham um and now we are the Seed of Abraham [Applause] he showed him Genesis Chapter 18 Genesis three men came to Abraham and Abraham when he saw them he said my Lord [Applause] because he recognized that threefold [Applause] but remember when the two went down to a Lord [Applause] and in your book he calls that one foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] to the place where he stood before the Lord [Applause] God has shown him from that place out [Music] [Applause] for to see these things the coming of this tribulation and all this amen amen God would not hide from us the thing is going to do I definitely know that yeah he will never hide from us [Applause] the time when the time arrives [Applause] you know God he spoke to Abraham now after that because of Timeless let's not read them Rich the Bible says what is your scripture then that's Genesis 19. 19. have you found it read it quickly they're not willing all right now listen Abraham knew exactly that for him to see he has to go to the place where he stood before the Lord [Applause] the bride knows exactly amen amen before they can see this tribulation period coming because now remember Abraham was not part of it that's right to Abraham Abraham came through me [Applause] the other two procedures and when they arrive at Lords at the gate not what the Lord was at the Gate of the place that's why lord said to them Lords [Applause] yeah he was a sort of you know today we have trilitarian and this is what we call them here is the thing nice length Abraham Abraham when that morning he he knew very well not for him to see yeah he has to go back to where he stood before the Lord [Applause] we also for us to see [Applause] we had to go back to the wedding back to where we stood before him [Applause] you know because we stood before him when it was God [Applause] Adam stood before God [Applause] now Redemption is to go back to where we were [Music] [Applause] [Applause] we will see aboard that's why we can see now that the Rapture will take place very soon [Applause] we can see now uh it has already started maybe you don't know Abraham knew already that there is something there but I must go back to where I stood before the Lord when he connected the place where he met the Lord [Applause] [Laughter] he could see as far as God could see [Applause] but because he was in the right place because you must come to the way the first [Applause] [Applause] I must go to the place I must come back to your place that's why we have to go back to Genesis and Beyond Genesis we're opened up from Genesis in the book here in the book of the seals Genesis now for us to see amen amen as part of the threefold we had to go back to where we stood before the Lord logos [Applause] that was the stages that was the stages that is your threefold [Applause] we could see things end as just like God we were a part of that threefold that's right even today be part of the threefold [Applause] oh my we can't time won't allow us um that is again yeah in in the same book page 69 Christ is the mystery of God revealed um now how he revealed himself here so he Reveals His Church you know the pride is a revealed Church [Applause] and he reveals himself here yeah he Reveals His church and raise it up by the same way [Applause] it I don't know maybe today you'll hear it let me close these books because I will come on amen amen can they they would find its spot its place [Applause] there's a place in place this place was there before the foundation of the world it was called the soul that was your place then it was called the soul he Reveals His Church firstly he says God revealed himself then he Reveals His change [Applause] they think Jesus and you say God is here you won't find God where there is a sound about God is in his word by revelation amen [Applause] I I rather put this my mother I remember my mother mother at one time she was with her friend [Applause] you'll forgive me we will continue we are going to set a a date it's long time since we left Malawi so we were but we are together stop the bed off yeah and I'm I'm glad to that we the sons of God don't have politics that's right yeah man we are going to continue with this I mean I've got the books here but let me read you this last party [Applause] God reveals himself here and he raised it up that means he raised his church up [Applause] um not by some meetings but by the word water amen amen you know I used to be denomination we thought that the things will be resolved by meetings but when God called me into this wedding now I realized the church is not run by meetings but it is run by God himself in in the in the people foreign [Laughter] [Applause] it doesn't say he held a meeting with the church he reveals God God believes in revealing things [Applause] you know he never sat down other shall pass with Abraham no Abraham and said man I want I want us to talk about Sodom and Gomorrah he revealed that to him [Applause] knew that for me to see the proceedings I must go back to where I stood before the Lord all right my brother my sister come back to where you met the Lord Genesis [Applause] then you'll find your way [Applause] okay amen now much you know a god process his own Ministry [Applause] in processing his ministry okay me and you me now we cannot come in [Applause] and help God no we are beings not of time a being of time depends on a meeting of time Abraham Abraham went back now it is a time for me to see what is going to happen to see what what's going to happen [Applause] I had to go back [Applause] amen amen we have we had to to go back now we now now can't we see now [Applause] I'm asking a question amen amen after we have connected because he says the seals were opened Beyond Time [Applause] that's why I'm saying you have only three why the people can't understand this have you ever heard people talking about the battle of Armageddon I mean all the church yesterday before the foundation of the world [Applause] why why even now now I can't ask somebody to him I taught about or we preach about the battle of Armageddon who is sickness we preached it we manage that to somebody [Applause] we preached amen amen that no but why we've got to remind this person timing again it is because if you are not part of the threefold I don't even know when is the seven seal revealed look [Music] okay because you can't hear it from here you've got to go back then you know it from the place you stood before them [Applause] the things that are revealed to you today [Applause] I mean in this age the things that you are receiving general of it is the things that you have heard and see before the foundation of the world when you stood before him now any plan outside of that any plan [Music] amen outside of what he has planned already shall never succeed you know I'm closing listening everything you think of it won't work for me [Applause] the only thing that helps me here is the word that he has already spoken [Applause] it is the word that helps me because he
