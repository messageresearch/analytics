[10:54] her and she finds the man that she loves
[10:58] no matter what he looks like he loves
[11:01] her she loves him that's an eternal
[11:06] mate and Glory there death or nothing

[32:24] church there's order and discipline
[32:31] so my
[32:32] work is to keep order and
[32:37] discipline which is above above the
[32:41] normal
[32:44] policemen and above the normal minister
[32:47] of
[32:49] [Music]
[32:50] police because it's from
[32:55] Heaven it's just to remind that
[32:59] sisters and
[33:03] brothers who are about to uh be
[33:09] married to keep order and
[33:15] discipline especially in their
[33:18] invitation cards
[33:28] there should be
[33:31] a a
[33:35] way that one should see that these are
[33:38] believers they believe the word of
[33:44] God so uh you know what I'm talking
[33:47] about those that are about to get
[33:51] married the right way is to
[33:56] discuss the invitation with your
[34:01] parents because they they are your
[34:05] parents they also want to uh appear on
[34:08] the
[34:11] invitation and from there on discuss it
[34:14] with the Elders of the
[34:17] church so that they should guide
[34:20] you in terms of order and
[34:24] discipline so those that are about to
[34:27] get married
[34:28] married got some two or three marriages
[34:32] that have to follow this
[34:36] one so do
[34:38] likewise this is the only place where I
[34:41] can bring this
[34:44] message God bless

[43:30] account before thee we should be found
[43:33] that we were diligent with the capital
[43:35] which you did give unto us help us
[43:38] father as we're joining this two father
[43:40] let us be joined to thee as we
[43:42] committing everything to th holy hands

[43:54] now God has given him a chance
[43:58] in life to get eternal
[44:01] life today is the day of a
[44:05] wedding so let's start where the wedding
[44:08] started in Genesis
[44:12] 2
[44:13] 21-23 verse
[44:20] 21-23 Genesis 2:
[44:23] 21-23 yes my
[44:25] brother and the the Lord God caused a
[44:28] deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[44:31] slept and he took one of his ribs and
[44:34] closed up the flesh instead thereof and
[44:37] the reap which the Lord God had taken
[44:40] from men made he a woman and brought ha
[44:43] unto the man and Adam said this is now
[44:46] bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh
[44:49] she shall be called woman because she
[44:52] was taken out of men amen amen may the
[44:55] Lord bless the leading of his word
[44:59] be
[45:06] seated uh for those of you who have
[45:10] never heard about the message of the
[45:14] hour we are believing the message of the
[45:17] hour which is according to Mali
[45:22] 4: it says behold I will send you Elijah
[45:26] the prophet
[45:28] and from there you can go to Luke
[45:31] 1730 1 as it was in the days of
[45:36] Noah so shall it be in the days when the
[45:39] son of man shall be
[45:43] revealed Revelation
[45:47] 10 in the days of the seventh
[45:51] angel all the Myst of God shall be
[45:55] revealed with that background
[45:59] to tell you something about
[46:01] wedding so when I say talk about the
[46:04] prophet I'm talking about this prophet
[46:06] of Malachi
[46:09] 4:5 take time to know that
[46:14] Prophet because now there are so many
[46:17] prophets but as it was in the Days of
[46:21] Elijah there were 400 Prophets
[46:28] said there not
[46:31] one after there were
[46:35] 400 there's always
[46:39] many always
[46:42] one I'll be talking about this one when
[46:45] I say Prophet I'll be talking about this
[46:48] one of Mali 4:
[46:52] 4 and the Lord caused the man to sleep
[46:58] uh
[46:59] sleep is closing
[47:01] eyes hallelujah amen if I say hallelujah
[47:05] you say amen hallelujah amen and you
[47:09] encourage
[47:10] me if you don't say amen I would know
[47:12] that you're not taking it then I'll take
[47:14] about three
[47:17] hours if you say amen I hear you
[47:20] understand I will
[47:23] stop so if you don't say Amen I'll take
[47:26] about 3 hours
[47:29] but if you say
[47:30] amen amen 30 minutes
[47:34] minutes hallelujah amen so he caused a
[47:39] man to
[47:41] sleep to find a
[47:44] wife so if a man wants to find a
[47:48] wife
[47:51] sleep we are opening our eyes too
[47:55] much on first
[47:59] Faceook our eyes are so widely
[48:04] open until now we can't even know who
[48:08] are we going to marry who going to be
[48:09] our wife or not our
[48:14] wife because too many faces are in our
[48:20] face you can no longer focus on one
[48:23] woman
[48:26] women we looking
[48:29] at and my brother if you go into that
[48:35] state you become
[48:37] confused because the best way you find a
[48:42] wife close your
[48:44] eyes let God give you a
[48:47] wife hallelujah amen so uh When You
[48:51] Close Your
[48:53] Eyes On Your Knees then give you fresh
[48:58] of your
[49:00] flesh remember if they transplant into
[49:08] you an
[49:12] organ which is not compatible with your
[49:18] DNA the day they implant that organ in
[49:22] you you will start rejecting it
[49:26] fighting
[49:28] it the day you get a
[49:31] wife is not part of
[49:34] you that's the day which your peace will
[49:44] disappear my sisters are very good
[49:48] example they always come to me oh
[49:52] brother hey I found a man is a very good
[49:56] zul
[50:00] he
[50:01] loves he can defend
[50:04] me but remember defense is
[50:10] offense how he defends
[50:13] you how he will beat
[50:23] you oh is a a good man
[50:26] he

[50:40] the in the
[50:44] community because love has got limits
[50:48] love has got
[50:50] limits hallelujah amen love has
[50:54] limits God gave man one
[50:58] wife God gave a woman one one
[51:04] man even if you are so

[51:09] you married to somebody
[51:13] else hallelujah amen that has to be born
[51:17] of your
[51:18] Bor that fresh of your
[51:24] fresh and as as it is
[51:28] if a
[51:29] man finds a
[51:32] wife finds a good
[51:35] thing God said it is not good for man to
[51:38] be
[51:41] alone that man my brother my
[51:45] sister that
[51:47] man has to be a king in this
[51:50] house whether he's tall whether he's

[51:58] educated when you come to your
[52:00] house you have to be in your
[52:05] kingdom you can have no peace anywhere
[52:09] else but when you come to your
[52:12] house you want to have
[52:14] P because
[52:17] home is where you are going to lay down
[52:20] and
[52:25] sleep Hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[52:29] yes that's much better
[52:30] now amen amen so
[52:33] marriage you have to marry like somebody
[52:37] like
[52:38] you as the prophet was talking about
[52:41] here the of Mali 4 5 ver
[52:45] 5 as they were com there BL was coming
[52:48] in was saying you have to love her how
[52:52] she looks
[52:57] because sometimes looks are
[53:00] deceiving because one day you discover
[53:04] that the
[53:06] looks have got no value in your
[53:10] life what you wanted was a friend you
[53:12] can talk to sorry what you wanted was a
[53:15] friend you can talk
[53:18] to hallelujah
[53:20] amen hallelujah uh it happened in a
[53:24] country called United Kingdom
[53:27] unom there was a prince he was called
[53:31] Charles he was looking for a wife and
[53:34] then he found a girl and when he went
[53:37] away his friend took that girl
[53:40] away he went and M married a beautiful
[53:46] woman very beautiful the whole world
[53:49] said this woman is
[53:52] beautiful but they found that Char was
[53:55] still tempted to go back to that
[54:00] woman without better looks but you know
[54:04] in the when when you in a
[54:07] kingdom you don't talk about KFC
[54:10] and disco and
[54:12] what when they in the loyal family they
[54:16] they talk about the quality of
[54:18] dogs how the horses look
[54:21] like is it a breed or is it a half breed
[54:27] so when somebody comes in they become
[54:30] confused you mean people can be talking
[54:33] about dogs the whole
[54:37] day that's the problem with
[54:39] loyalty they talk about things which are
[54:43] useless they don't talk about all
[54:45] Michael Jackson and things like that
[54:48] they they are loyalty and actually they
[54:51] even taught when when you sit you down
[54:55] on a seat
[54:57] don't talk to the person your
[54:59] left you talk to the
[55:02] person when you when you scoop soup from
[55:05] the
[55:06] cup don't scoop it towards
[55:09] yourself you scoop
[55:15] it it's
[55:17] loyalty they have things pertaining to
[55:21] loyalty the same with people of God they
[55:25] got things pertaining to them which
[55:28] doesn't make to the other sense to the
[55:30] other people but makes sense to only
[55:35] those who are of the loyal
[55:40] blood hallelujah amen so uh they didn't
[55:45] go wrong and they
[55:48] divorced and uh Charles went back to the
[55:51] woman
[55:53] which they Contin talking about horses
[55:55] now
[56:05] so if a
[56:07] woman is going to come into a
[56:10] family the woman has to be compatible
[56:13] with a
[56:15] family and if you can take the story of
[56:19] Lea in the Bible I don't have much time
[56:23] have you ever heard of Lea how many of
[56:25] have ever heard of just ra your hand
[56:28] and no no no no I should and then I
[56:30] should read it because a lot of you
[56:32] haven't
[56:35] read Rebecca
[56:39] was a wife to the to son of
[56:45] Abraham which
[56:47] Abraham told his
[56:50] servant which is a representative of the
[56:53] Prophet
[56:54] now the same Prophet talking about to go
[56:58] and find a
[57:00] bride for Isaac but you can see if you
[57:04] go to uh Genesis
[57:07] 24 it's my brother we need to read amen
[57:11] without reading in the Bible the wedding
[57:13] is
[57:14] nothing let's start from the
[57:18] Bible so uh will
[57:23] be yes so if you can go 24 vers
[57:27] three I I'll make the just go read in
[57:32] English I
[57:33] willar by the Lord that's Abraham
[57:36] telling his
[57:39] servant yes and I will make this swear
[57:42] by the Lord the god of Heaven and the
[57:44] god of the earth that thou shalt not
[57:47] take a wife unto my son of the daughters
[57:49] of the canites among whom I dwell don't
[57:53] marry among the people which I'm
[57:55] dwelling
[57:57] [Music]
[57:58] in because the people which were
[58:00] dwelling in they are the owners of the
[58:04] land and you know the problem with the
[58:06] owners of the
[58:10] land they are still dwell in that
[58:12] country until they forget
[58:18] God amen amen verse four thou sh go unto
[58:22] my country and to my Kindred and take a
[58:26] wife unto my son Isaac so he was
[58:29] supposed to go among his
[58:33] Kindred people like
[58:36] him you
[58:38] remember Adam said this is born of my
[58:42] Bor fresh of my
[58:45] fresh they were
[58:48] compatible and here we are seeing the
[58:50] same thing that when
[58:53] Abraham is looking for a wife
[58:56] for his son is looking for compatibility
[59:00] as
[59:04] well and you see when this
[59:08] servant comes to the land which he was
[59:10] sent
[59:12] to uh if you can go
[59:17] um of course
[59:20] uh I I want there some there's somewhere
[59:23] which I want you to read for me
[59:26] amen uh verse 10 ver 10 24:
[59:30] 10 and the servant took 10 camel of the
[59:34] C of the camels of his master and
[59:38] departed for all the goods of his master
[59:40] were in his hand and he arose and went
[59:43] to Mesopotamia andto the city of nah uh
[59:48] 12 and he said oh Lord God of my master
[59:51] Abraham now this is him praying
[59:56] before he finds a
[59:58] wife hey brothers let's pray before he
[1:00:00] find a
[1:00:04] wife a wife is a good
[1:00:07] thing but another wife is a bad
[1:00:13] thing a wife is a good
[1:00:16] thing but I'm telling you the
[1:00:18] truth uh those of you who have divorced
[1:00:21] here if I can ask you how was the wife
[1:00:26] you shall tell me hey brother you never
[1:00:29] know what I went
[1:00:33] through but didn't you love yes in the
[1:00:35] beginning I left
[1:00:38] her but it turned
[1:00:40] out because you started
[1:00:44] wrong you might find each other at a l
[1:00:47] match at a football match just imagine
[1:00:51] you you are looking for a wife and you
[1:00:53] find each other a football match
[1:00:59] and the other guy is stamping on the
[1:01:00] other the other one is stamping on the
[1:01:02] other the other one is kicking the other
[1:01:05] one and the wife which you are looking
[1:01:07] for likes
[1:01:18] that what do you want her to be do in
[1:01:20] the house
[1:01:29] so this woman what type of a woman was
[1:01:32] he looking
[1:01:33] for let's go to uh verse 12 ver and he
[1:01:37] said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I
[1:01:40] pray thee send me good speed this day
[1:01:43] and show kindness unto my master
[1:01:46] Abraham yes go ahead behold I stand Here
[1:01:49] by The Well of water and the daughters
[1:01:52] of the of the men of the City come out
[1:01:55] to Dr forward and let it come to pass
[1:01:58] that the dumel to whom I shall say let
[1:02:02] down thy picture I pray thee that I
[1:02:04] might drink and she shall say drink and
[1:02:09] I will give thy camels drink also let
[1:02:12] the same be she that thou has appointed
[1:02:15] for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall
[1:02:18] I know that thou has showed kindness
[1:02:20] unto my master Hallelujah uh um you see
[1:02:25] what the what what is he looking
[1:02:28] for you remember how many cams were
[1:02:33] there 10
[1:02:35] camels so she he he was looking for a
[1:02:38] woman who could who could make 10 camels
[1:02:44] drink okay for example the least the cam
[1:02:47] can take is 70
[1:02:51] lit and there was
[1:02:54] camels and how how many does a bucket
[1:02:58] contain 10 or 15
[1:03:00] lit but when she he was asking
[1:03:03] her he asked most the most man can take
[1:03:06] his one liter at a
[1:03:10] time he was asking for a one
[1:03:13] lit yet he needed 700
[1:03:20] l so that's how what happens in the
[1:03:24] marriage ask a woman will you marry
[1:03:27] me what the woman doesn't
[1:03:29] know they are marrying the whole
[1:03:33] tribe and the bad thing which we
[1:03:37] do we take our best to the
[1:03:41] wedding we keep our w at
[1:03:44] home Mama this is not the best we have
[1:03:47] come here
[1:03:50] there they have left the family behind
[1:03:56] you have to cook for all of
[1:04:01] them they will not even be
[1:04:09] grateful he as asked a simple
[1:04:13] ask yet under that simple
[1:04:16] ask there is a lot of
[1:04:18] work how many times did that girl land
[1:04:21] down to the liver
[1:04:26] to make 10 camels
[1:04:30] drink and my my my brother uh my
[1:04:35] sister she made that
[1:04:38] work to the amazement of the
[1:04:42] Prophet that girl was able to and he
[1:04:46] didn't even tell her he just said I need
[1:04:49] a
[1:04:50] drink I said I need a
[1:04:53] drink amen amen they way told you
[1:04:58] sister but the good thing was this the
[1:05:02] same animals which she was making to
[1:05:07] drink where the animals which are going
[1:05:09] to carry
[1:05:15] her the same people which are going to
[1:05:17] give food in your
[1:05:20] house are the same people who are going
[1:05:22] to be your people
[1:05:25] people shall be your
[1:05:27] people the same Holy Ghost they take
[1:05:30] care of
[1:05:32] now the same Holy Ghost is going to take
[1:05:35] us to the other
[1:05:37] side oh my brother you better get the
[1:05:40] Holy Ghost
[1:05:42] now I don't talk about that Holy Ghost
[1:05:44] which you go around uh doing all those
[1:05:47] things which I don't I see people doing
[1:05:53] now those are spirits
[1:05:56] what I talk about is the Holy Ghost
[1:05:58] which you can get and remain
[1:06:03] normal because Samuel was full of the
[1:06:07] Holy Ghost he was a normal person El
[1:06:11] full of Holy Ghost he was a normal
[1:06:15] person where is this madness coming from
[1:06:17] to say this a form of the Holy
[1:06:24] Ghost if you read the the whole
[1:06:27] Bible people full of the Holy Ghost the
[1:06:32] bapti was full of the Holy
[1:06:36] Ghost he never performed drama for
[1:06:44] people he was a normal
[1:06:48] person because when the power comes upon
[1:06:52] you it comes with fullest
[1:07:00] amen
[1:07:15] amen so we can see
[1:07:18] here how the bride was
[1:07:21] chosen the bride was
[1:07:23] chosen under 11
[1:07:26] ration and that's where most of us are
[1:07:29] going
[1:07:30] [Music]
[1:07:32] wrong you know we I don't know why man
[1:07:35] thinks that he
[1:07:38] thinks because uh if you look at the
[1:07:41] universe now is even as of
[1:07:45] today if you look at the
[1:07:47] universe there's no way man can say that
[1:07:50] he
[1:07:52] thinks every day we are discovering new
[1:08:01] things um there was a time which they
[1:08:03] sent a hobo telescope up
[1:08:07] there we are seeing quite a lot of
[1:08:10] things come the J web telescope
[1:08:14] now it looks as if we were
[1:08:19] blind we are completely
[1:08:21] blind they can choose a black spot in
[1:08:24] the sky
[1:08:26] in the
[1:08:27] universe which you can't see anything
[1:08:30] but when they focus on that one they
[1:08:32] find they millions of universes just in
[1:08:35] that
[1:08:38] SP why are you trusting your own
[1:08:46] scope you are
[1:08:48] blind we don't know what is going to
[1:08:50] happen
[1:08:52] next so that means we have to find
[1:08:56] someone who is able to see beyond our
[1:08:59] what our eyes can
[1:09:03] see your eyes can only see under
[1:09:06] spectrum and that Spectrum moves from
[1:09:09] Blue to maybe to maybe green or red that
[1:09:14] side after that any infrared
[1:09:21] infra you can't see anything why are you
[1:09:24] trusting on yourself
[1:09:27] yet you can't see
[1:09:29] anything right away here there are
[1:09:32] pictures passing through
[1:09:34] here you can't see them why trust
[1:09:41] yourself my brother stop trusting your
[1:09:45] head it's as empty as
[1:09:51] possible can you tell can you tell an
[1:09:54] aunt living in this mountain
[1:10:00] yeah in that mountain there's an
[1:10:03] ant the whole of its
[1:10:06] universe is that is that
[1:10:08] mountain it doesn't know there is a
[1:10:10] white house
[1:10:13] somewhere uh there's a Mr Putin there's
[1:10:16] Mr Bush he doesn't know anything
[1:10:20] about to God we are just as good as ants
[1:10:25] sometimes answer are
[1:10:28] bigger if you can talk about the
[1:10:31] universe what's the distance you say we
[1:10:33] are in the solar
[1:10:35] system from here to the planet Uranus is
[1:10:38] about 4 billion
[1:10:42] kilm if you go there L there is
[1:10:46] diamonds the diamonds which are busy
[1:10:48] killing one another
[1:10:50] for it's rain just in our own universe
[1:10:56] it's just
[1:10:58] rain amen amen so why choose this
[1:11:03] life which is just for a
[1:11:06] time just like a flower you flourish and
[1:11:09] then the next time you are
[1:11:11] gone today I want you to
