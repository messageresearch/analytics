[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Let us thank the Lord again this morning
[1:13:23] for having kept us and gave us an
[1:13:26] opportunity to come together.
[1:13:30] It's not everyone who had this
[1:13:31] opportunity.
[1:13:34] We will not have this opportunity
[1:13:37] forever
[1:13:40] because the prophet has taught us
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; that time will come to an end. Amen.
[1:13:52] We greet you saints.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Today I'm the local pastor.
[1:14:04] I'm going to introduce our visitors
[1:14:07] mainly from Ptoria
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; mainly the ones are coming from Ptoria.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; We'll start with
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; We have our pastor here.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Pastor Mua.
[1:14:29] [applause]
[1:14:34] We are thankful
[1:14:38] [cough]
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; he's [clears throat] not alone.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; He came together with the elders of the
[1:14:45] church.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; We have our elder.
[1:14:55] [applause]
[1:15:00] We have our elder.
[1:15:04] [applause]
[1:15:09] Amen. Now
[1:15:15] they have also their deacon brother.
[1:15:18] Brother Murani.
[1:15:20] [applause]
[1:15:24] Now
[1:15:28] just feel free be at home
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; and everywhere
[1:15:39] it praises
[1:15:43] the more it goes higher
[1:15:46] the more can see better down here.
[1:15:50] We also know that
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; coming here
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; you were brought here by a call.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; The call which is within you.
[1:16:09] If you have a call within you,
[1:16:13] there is another call somewhere.
[1:16:18] That is why you responded to the other
[1:16:21] call.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible say you cannot come
[1:16:27] unless you have been called.
[1:16:30] We are thankful.
[1:16:33] This morning we have two services.
[1:16:38] This is the first one that has already
[1:16:39] started
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; and [snorts] the second service will
[1:16:43] start at 14
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; 30.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Unless
[1:16:49] unless the elders decide otherwise
[1:16:56] if they have decided in a different way
[1:16:58] they will make means to inform us.
[1:17:04] Now we have come to the point of the
[1:17:06] word of God.
[1:17:08] We have our elder
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; from Ptorian.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Elders. [applause]
[1:17:22] He's the one who's going to minister the
[1:17:23] word to us
[1:17:27] so they can give us a worshiing song.
[1:17:31] to welcome our elder.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Let me not leave this part out.
[1:17:50] Our brother here was sister.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Sister Ma.
[1:17:58] uh
[1:18:00] uh brother American Ma
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; she's requesting on behalf of brother
[1:18:06] American Ma
[1:18:09] whose wife is sick.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; So they are requesting prayers for her.
[1:18:16] We have [snorts] our elders here
[1:18:20] who just ask our elder [snorts]
[1:18:25] to commit this prayer request to the
[1:18:27] Lord.
[1:18:31] We have been promised that if you ask
[1:18:33] you'll be given.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; As the pastor said, remind us of the
[1:18:59] scripture said
[1:19:02] [clears throat]
[1:19:20] What we know God the prayer has got no
[1:19:24] boundaries.
[1:19:26] Father God is got no border gates
[1:19:29] when we call upon the name of the Lord.
[1:19:37] Amen.
[1:19:55] medication.
[1:19:59] Oh
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; pastor, our pastor
[1:20:02] Kima has taught us that we have to cast
[1:20:05] out the generator that is generating
[1:20:09] that sickness which is the demon that is
[1:20:12] inside that person. That is why even we
[1:20:15] are standing here with the authority
[1:20:17] that God has given unto us
[1:20:20] you Satan and your devils. We command
[1:20:24] you in the name of Jesus. We are not
[1:20:25] here to beg you or to ask you, but we
[1:20:28] are here as the sons and daughters of
[1:20:30] God to to chase you out, get out of that
[1:20:34] body of our sister in the name of Jesus.
[1:20:36] Father God, we claim the healing of our
[1:20:39] sister. And we believe, Father God, that
[1:20:40] our sister, she's been healed. And we
[1:20:42] thank you Lord for healing her in Jesus
[1:20:45] name we pray. Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; We are thankful.
[1:20:58] Give us that woriing song as we welcome
[1:21:00] you.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; We believe that they say we should come
[1:21:07] to the church having an expectation
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; and we receive according to our
[1:21:11] expectations.
[1:21:17] If you have a bigger container,
[1:21:20] you will leave your container being
[1:21:22] full.
[1:21:24] If it's a small container,
[1:21:27] it will also be full
[1:21:31] to that capacity
[1:21:35] because God answers [snorts] according
[1:21:36] to what you requested.
[1:21:39] That is why you say,
[1:21:42] ask enough [snorts]
[1:21:46] so that God can please you.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; We are waiting for the word.
[1:21:53] Amen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; But in the days
[1:21:58] of the voice

[1:33:35] I'll be very slow
[1:33:38] so that our brother must spring the
[1:33:40] right weight.
[1:33:45] Beware of the delaying process.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; That is the text.
[1:33:56] Why am I having the inherit inheritance
[1:34:00] and and possession
[1:34:08] and the text of beware of the delaying
[1:34:10] process?
[1:34:15] It is because
[1:34:19] when you are uh about to receive your
[1:34:24] inheritance,
[1:34:29] the devil will always try to the
[1:34:31] delaying tactics
[1:34:39] so that you could not reach your
[1:34:42] inheritance.
[1:34:46] and and possess it.
[1:34:51] Right.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] [clears throat]
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Now, what is an inheritance in our case?
[1:34:56] Okay. What I'm going to do, sorry, bro.
[1:34:58] What I'm going to do,
[1:35:01] I will be in the Old Testament,
[1:35:05] showing the inheritance.
[1:35:09] We've got two services today.
[1:35:13] And then in the in the afternoon,
[1:35:17] I'll be in the New Testament
[1:35:21] and show you the relevancy
[1:35:27] because
[1:35:29] we have a ministry
[1:35:33] that is relevant to the time that you
[1:35:35] are living in.
[1:35:40] Amen.
[1:35:50] Okay, we've got the ministry
[1:35:54] that is relevant to the time that we're
[1:35:56] living in.
[1:36:01] And if we ignore that ministry,
[1:36:06] we will be beating about the bush.
[1:36:10] Amen.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; And then instead of going to the point,
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; right? Amen. We have a ministry
[1:36:22] that has got an inher inheritance
[1:36:27] and then we must be able
[1:36:30] to identify that ministry
[1:36:33] and stick to that ministry
[1:36:36] because that is the one
[1:36:39] that will give us a rapturing faith.
[1:36:45] Amen.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Last time when I was preaching here
[1:36:49] I said
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; a ser someone can be very nice.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that someone
[1:37:01] but uh find that now you cannot reach
[1:37:05] your destination without someone.
[1:37:14] Uh it's like there's some other food
[1:37:21] say
[1:37:26] it's a snack.
[1:37:29] You won't reach where you are going.
[1:37:32] You won't you won't be filled.
[1:37:35] It's a snack. You're waiting for food.
[1:37:39] Now
[1:37:41] a a sermon
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; that is not relevant.
[1:37:48] Uh
[1:37:52] you don't get full because of it. It's a
[1:37:54] sermon is good. There's nothing wrong
[1:37:56] with it.
[1:38:00] But you won't reach your destiny.
[1:38:03] Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; As believers,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; we are on journey
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; we have crossed the river Jordan.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; The Joshua's here
[1:38:20] has given us inheritance.
[1:38:25] Now that we have our inheritance,
[1:38:28] what are we doing with it?
[1:38:31] Amen.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Remember that our inheritance
[1:38:35] is the revelation of the seventh sea.
[1:38:40] Amen. Now if our inheritance is the
[1:38:43] revelation of the seven.
[1:38:47] Now the seventh seal have been revealed
[1:38:52] when it's revealed.
[1:38:54] So what?
[1:38:57] How does it benefit you? Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; That's what we are going to talk about.
[1:39:07] You've got your inheritance.
[1:39:10] I was checking the word inheritance.
[1:39:15] It says inheritance
[1:39:19] is to receive your asset.
[1:39:24] Amen.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because our title is inheritance
[1:39:28] and possession.
[1:39:36] Now, inheritance
[1:39:38] is to receive the asset
[1:39:43] and possession
[1:39:46] possession. It's an it's an act
[1:39:51] of controlling,
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; holding,
[1:39:56] enjoying
[1:39:58] those assets.
[1:40:00] If your father
[1:40:03] gives you a bicycle
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; says this is your inheritance.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; That bicycle
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; is your inheritance.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Now you possess it.
[1:40:20] When you possess it,
[1:40:22] you start riding it now.
[1:40:28] You enjoy it now. It's your possession.
[1:40:34] But inheritance
[1:40:36] is when you receive it.
[1:40:39] What are you doing with it?
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Inheritance,
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; it's when we are positionally placed,
[1:40:52] right? Amen. And then you given that
[1:40:55] inheritance.
[1:40:58] Now we need to enjoy it.
[1:41:06] Now look at the enjoyment.
[1:41:11] If you read
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 10,
[1:41:17] verse 8,
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; verse eight,
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; you'll see how we enjoy our our our
[1:41:25] inheritance.
[1:41:29] Can you read it my brother?
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:31] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:41:34] spake unto me again and said, "Go and
[1:41:38] take the little book which is open in
[1:41:40] the hand of the angel, which standeth
[1:41:43] upon the sea and upon the earth."
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Continue.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; And I went unto the angel, and said unto
[1:41:52] him, Give me the book. And he said unto
[1:41:55] me, take it and eat it up, and it shall
[1:41:59] make thy belly bitter, but it shall be
[1:42:02] in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; You see how we're going to enjoy that
[1:42:07] book,
[1:42:09] that inheritance, but we'll come and
[1:42:11] explain that.
[1:42:13] So, let me go to the Old Testament,
[1:42:18] uh, Numbers chapter 32. I just want you
[1:42:21] to to understand what I'm going to talk
[1:42:24] about.
[1:42:26] I was just laying a foundation.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Uh let's go to uh the book of numbers.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Uh uh let's read
[1:42:41] verse chapter 32.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Numbers 32.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Let's start with verse 6.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Verse six.
[1:42:49] And Moses said unto the children of God,
[1:42:53] and to the children of Reuben, Shall
[1:42:56] your brethren go to war, and shall ye
[1:42:58] sit here? And wherefore discourage ye
[1:43:02] the heart of the children of Israel from
[1:43:04] going over into the land which the Lord
[1:43:07] hath given them.
[1:43:09] Thus did your fathers when I sent them
[1:43:13] from Gadesh Banana to see the land.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; And can you go to verse 13?
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Verse 13.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; And the Lord's anger was kindled against
[1:43:24] Israel. And he made them wander in the
[1:43:27] wilderness 40 years until all the
[1:43:30] generations
[1:43:32] that had done evil in the sight of the
[1:43:35] Lord was consumed.
[1:43:38] So they were from Egypt
[1:43:43] to their promised land
[1:43:46] where they need to have their
[1:43:49] uh inheritance.
[1:43:53] Amen. I understand they were supposed to
[1:43:56] take 40 days.
[1:44:02] You'll correct me. You'll correct me.
[1:44:05] But they took 40
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; years.
[1:44:10] Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Now that's why my text says beware of
[1:44:15] the delaying process.
[1:44:22] On their way there were some delaying
[1:44:25] process.
[1:44:28] Whenever I I'm speaking about this Old
[1:44:31] Testament,
[1:44:34] you always transfer it to the New
[1:44:36] Testament.
[1:44:39] But but stick
[1:44:42] to the relevant ministry.
[1:44:46] Are we together?
[1:44:48] There was some delaying process
[1:44:53] and then you check on your side.
[1:44:58] What is the delaying process in the time
[1:45:00] that you are living in?
[1:45:05] Remember the Old Testament
[1:45:08] is the shadow of the New Testament.
[1:45:12] The Bible says, "And the Lord's anger
[1:45:16] was kindled
[1:45:21] against Israel,
[1:45:23] and he made them wander IN THE
[1:45:25] WILDERNESS.
[1:45:28] FOR 40 DAYS.
[1:45:31] But coming to us,
[1:45:34] it has to do with a finished work.
[1:45:39] It has to do with the lamb's book of
[1:45:41] life.
[1:45:44] It's a complete job.
[1:45:47] All those their names are found in that
[1:45:49] book.
[1:45:53] They will never be delayed.
[1:45:57] by the demonic tactics
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; because it's it's a finished work,
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; right? Amen. So he made them wander in
[1:46:09] the wilderness for 40 years
[1:46:13] until all the generations
[1:46:17] that had done evil in the sight of the
[1:46:19] Lord
[1:46:21] was consumed.
[1:46:25] Now there was a a house of Gad
[1:46:30] and Reuben and Manas
[1:46:34] and the half tribe of manas actually
[1:46:39] the Bible speak it as a two and a half
[1:46:41] tribe
[1:46:47] the tribe of manas
[1:46:49] I mean the tribe of Reuben
[1:46:52] the tribe of
[1:46:55] and half of manas.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; They went to Moses
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; and said to Moses,
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; we see that place is it's there's a
[1:47:09] place they name it. I'll get you the
[1:47:12] scripture
[1:47:16] which is good for our cattle.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; But that place is not beyond
[1:47:25] It's not beyond Jordan.
[1:47:28] It's on this side. They were supposed to
[1:47:30] cross Jordan.
[1:47:33] And that place was very fatile.
[1:47:37] Then they went to Moses and said, "Uh,
[1:47:41] can we
[1:47:44] be on the other side of the road?
[1:47:48] We don't want to cross that side because
[1:47:51] there's a grazing place.
[1:47:54] That is why now in verse uh 6 326,
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Moses said unto the children of God and
[1:48:04] to the children of Reuben,
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; shall your brethren go to war,
[1:48:13] and you shall sit here.
[1:48:16] In verse 27, it says,
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; verse 27,
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; "And wherefore discourage ye the heart
[1:48:22] of the children of Israel,
[1:48:29] from going over
[1:48:32] into the land
[1:48:36] which the Lord has given them."
[1:48:40] The Lord has given them and you are
[1:48:43] discouraging them.
[1:48:46] Because you are a team,
[1:48:48] you need to fight
[1:48:51] as the 12 tribes of Israel.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; And once you don't do that,
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; you are discouraging.
[1:49:01] Exactly.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; H your brothers,
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:49:07] I want also also
[1:49:10] to check on numbers 33
[1:49:15] verse 54.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Verse 54.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; I will explain that in the afternoon.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:49:23] Verse 54.
[1:49:25] Can you read?
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; And he shall divide
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; up to up to 5.
[1:49:29] Let me see. Up to 55. My prayer.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; And you shall divide the land by lot for
[1:49:36] an inheritance among your families, and
[1:49:39] to the more ye shall give the more
[1:49:43] inheritance,
[1:49:45] and to the fewer ye shall give the less
[1:49:47] inheritance. Every man's inheritance
[1:49:50] shall be in the place where his lord
[1:49:53] fleth. According to the tribes of your
[1:49:56] fathers, he shall inherit. But if you
[1:49:59] will not drive out the inheritance
[1:50:04] of the land from before.
[1:50:12] But if you will not drive out the
[1:50:14] inheritance
[1:50:15] of the land from before you, then it
[1:50:19] shall come to pass that those which
[1:50:23] ye let remain of them shall be pricked
[1:50:28] in your eyes,
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; and thorns in your sight, and shall vex
[1:50:35] you in the land wherein ye dwell. 56
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Moreover, it shall come to pass that I
[1:50:42] shall do unto you as I thought to do
[1:50:46] unto them.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Right now,
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; slowly, let's go on.
[1:50:58] So here you you hear there's a promise
[1:51:02] that they must cross over
[1:51:05] and when they cross over they shall
[1:51:08] divide the land
[1:51:10] accordingly.
[1:51:12] The the Bible says here
[1:51:16] they shall divide the land the land by
[1:51:19] Lord.
[1:51:25] In other words, there should be no bias
[1:51:27] about it
[1:51:31] when they allocate.
[1:51:35] It must not be a bias
[1:51:39] because when they were born,
[1:51:43] their place was identified.
[1:51:47] Remember that we were in him.
[1:51:51] our place
[1:51:54] identified in him.
[1:51:58] And you should remember also
[1:52:01] that if you go to Deuteronomy 32
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; and verse 4,
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; verse four,
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; it says he is a rock.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; In verse 18,
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; verse 18,
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; it says now
[1:52:21] You've got it. Just read verse 4 and 18.
[1:52:24] Listen carefully.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; He is the rock. His work is perfect. For
[1:52:29] all his ways are judgment. A God of
[1:52:33] truth and without iniquity. Just and
[1:52:36] right is he.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; He is a rock,
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Verse 18. of the rock that begat thee,
[1:52:45] thou art unmindful,
[1:52:47] and has forgotten God that formed thee.
[1:52:51] You are ducked out of that rock
[1:52:55] and now you are unmindful.
[1:52:59] Are we together? Amen. Now it doesn't
[1:53:02] work like that.
[1:53:04] If we are from that road,
[1:53:08] everybody
[1:53:10] is positioned in that role.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; When uh uh
[1:53:17] um who's that brother that had a dream
[1:53:19] about the
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; the pyramid?
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Junior Jackson.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Junior Jackson.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Junior Jackson
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; saw brother.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; I mean as saw the pyramid pyramid. It
[1:53:33] was a rock.
[1:53:35] He explained that. Brother explained
[1:53:38] that the dream of brother Junior
[1:53:41] Jackson,
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; it was a rock.
[1:53:45] And if it was a rock,
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; remember,
[1:53:51] brother Brenam,
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham speaks about the
[1:53:54] cornerstone
[1:53:57] of which the pastor also mentions.
[1:54:01] The cornerstone is down there.
[1:54:05] But that cornerstone now became now a
[1:54:07] capstone.
[1:54:11] But as it goes up,
[1:54:15] everybody
[1:54:17] is patched up positionally
[1:54:20] in all the church ages.
[1:54:23] The bride is not only
[1:54:26] in the church.
[1:54:29] No, the bride
[1:54:31] started from Ephesus.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; That is a stone.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Another one.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Ephesis,
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Pergamos,
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Philadelphia,
[1:54:45] I'm inside Philadelphia and those are
[1:54:48] little stone
[1:54:51] that builds the pyramid. Pyramid. Amen.
[1:54:54] Right. Amen.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; So there is no one
[1:54:57] that will miss his position.
[1:55:02] There is not a bride
[1:55:05] that will miss the position.
[1:55:10] And when the capstone came
[1:55:14] to cap it
[1:55:16] is to adopt the whole thing.
[1:55:21] So now your inheritance
[1:55:25] you'll be allotted
[1:55:28] without being a bias allocation.
[1:55:34] Everybody
[1:55:36] will get what belongs to him
[1:55:39] and and will be satisfied
[1:55:44] about what comes uh uh h to him.
[1:55:49] That's why now it says here
[1:55:52] inheritistance is to receiving your
[1:55:54] assets
[1:55:58] while possession and possession
[1:56:01] possession is a act
[1:56:04] of actually
[1:56:06] holding
[1:56:08] controlling
[1:56:10] and enjoying those
[1:56:14] because it's a full benefit of your
[1:56:17] inheritance.
[1:56:25] So we think of inheritance as being
[1:56:27] given the deed.
[1:56:33] When you're given the deed
[1:56:36] that is your inheritance
[1:56:38] while position
[1:56:41] is being is is having
[1:56:45] is I mean is living in and and using
[1:56:48] that househance
[1:56:54] I mean inheritance
[1:56:56] you are given the deed
[1:57:00] but possession
[1:57:04] we are in
[1:57:06] and using that.
[1:57:10] Let me quote what brother Brennham says.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Israel and the church
[1:57:16] paragraph 85.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 85.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; We are living in the last days,
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; We are here at the end of the road.
[1:57:32] Thank God for some Calebs and Joshua's
[1:57:36] that ready to go over
[1:57:43] go over and bring back the evidence.
[1:57:48] It's a great land.
[1:57:52] bringing back two bunches of grapes
[1:57:58] and they were walking like this
[1:58:01] to try
[1:58:03] to pack it.
[1:58:06] What a ground.
[1:58:09] What a place.
[1:58:12] Thank God for people who crossed over.
[1:58:19] Amen. Right. Amen.
[1:58:22] So now
[1:58:24] crossing over
[1:58:27] is crossing over from the church ages
[1:58:33] to the to the seals
[1:58:36] crossing over
[1:58:38] from the book of life
[1:58:41] to the lamb's book of life
[1:58:44] will will will touch that.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:48] Now it says God will raise up a new
[1:58:51] system.
[1:58:56] I'm reading this uh book as I was with
[1:58:59] Moses.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; I didn't write the the paragraph. Maybe
[1:59:04] it could be paragraph 41.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; God will raise up a new system called
[1:59:10] interdenominational system.
[1:59:21] by the power of God
[1:59:23] that will take the church into the
[1:59:25] promised land.
[1:59:30] When you worship,
[1:59:33] when you fellowship,
[1:59:35] you must know that you are on a chain.
[1:59:40] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; You are we are we are moving.
[1:59:45] from one point
[1:59:47] to another.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; So God
[1:59:53] will raise up a new system,
[1:59:59] interdenominational
[2:00:00] system
[2:00:04] by the power of God that will take the
[2:00:06] church into the promised land.
[2:00:13] That's what we are. That's what the
[2:00:15] ministry want
[2:00:18] that we let us go.
[2:00:22] It
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; it should not be a stagnant ministry.
[2:00:29] We need to be jealous of our ministry.
[2:00:36] Right. Amen.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; We need to see it that it carries what
[2:00:40] we want.
[2:00:45] And we need to feel it.
[2:00:48] We need to hear it
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; and we need to understand it
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; and we need to be part of it.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; That will take take the church
[2:01:01] into the promised land.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Organizations and denominations has
[2:01:09] messed it up.
[2:01:14] Each one after the their own theology,
[2:01:22] each one after their own way of
[2:01:24] thinking.
[2:01:28] But God
[2:01:30] will take his Holy Spirit
[2:01:34] and he will raise up his Joshua
[2:01:37] that will take the church
[2:01:41] to the promise
[2:01:44] with no denominational string ties
[2:01:48] anywhere
[2:01:53] but will take over his church.
[2:01:59] Amen. It says Moses was a lawgiver.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Joshua
[2:02:07] was called of grace
[2:02:10] and he took the church on.
[2:02:14] Moses
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; was a lawgiver,
[2:02:18] gave them the law. But when Joshua came,
[2:02:23] he took the church on
[2:02:27] He let it he let it move.
[2:02:30] He crossed over.
[2:02:32] He met a cherub with a with a sword.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; And then he he had an anointing of that
[2:02:41] cherub.
[2:02:43] Now the church
[2:02:46] must move
[2:02:48] until it meets the cherub.
[2:02:52] Because when they lose their
[2:02:55] inheritance,
[2:02:57] there was a cherub
[2:03:00] that was set on their state
[2:03:04] on their place
[2:03:06] was a cherub.
[2:03:09] It says so
[2:03:11] when mo when when Adam and Eve
[2:03:15] were ousted out of the garden of Eden
[2:03:19] and then there was a cherub
[2:03:21] that had a sword
[2:03:24] and now to guard
[2:03:27] the way to the tree of life.
[2:03:33] Right now, you can't go to the tree of
[2:03:36] life
[2:03:38] without having met that cherub.
[2:03:43] Remember that cherub had a sword.
[2:03:48] Are we together? When Joshua
[2:03:51] cross over, he met a cherub with a
[2:03:54] sword.
[2:03:56] When brother Brenham was praying, he
[2:04:00] received that sword.
[2:04:02] Are we together?
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; What happened to that sword?
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Go and look in your wardrobe. You'll
[2:04:09] find it.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[2:04:17] the word of God. It's like a double
[2:04:21] doubleged sword.
[2:04:24] And when when it was given to brother
[2:04:27] Brennan Brennan,
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; it was said the sword of a king
[2:04:34] and then he said the sword of the king
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; is the word of God.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Right? We will come to that in the
[2:04:46] afternoon.
[2:04:48] Moses was a lawgiver.
[2:04:52] Joshua
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; was called of grace.
[2:04:59] He took the church off.
[2:05:03] If you go to paragraph 42 in the same
[2:05:05] book,
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; as I was with Moses,
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; as I was with Moses,
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; the prophet says,
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; we find also that Joshua
[2:05:17] knowing this core mission.
[2:05:23] You must remember
[2:05:25] brother Brennham Brennham
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; had a commission.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; But there was there was another time
[2:05:35] where he received a new commission,
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; He had his own rue. It say the Bible
[2:05:44] says
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; in uh
[2:05:49] Matthew 17
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; in verse 11 it says
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; can can you read it? Matthew 17
[2:06:00] Matthew 17 says
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; verse verse verse 11 my prayer.
[2:06:06] And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[2:06:09] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[2:06:12] all things.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Right? He shall first come Elijah
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; and restore things.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; We know about all the restoration.
[2:06:28] After the restoration,
[2:06:30] the ministry changed.
[2:06:33] There was a ministry
[2:06:35] of restoration
[2:06:37] back
[2:06:39] to the foundations
[2:06:42] of the prophets and apostles.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; And then after restoration,
[2:06:48] then the ministry changes
[2:06:51] because it is
[2:06:55] the Holy Ghost building the church
[2:06:59] and then it was dismantled.
[2:07:03] like we've said the Pentecostals
[2:07:06] and then God sent brother Brennan
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; to restore everything
[2:07:13] you know Elijah
[2:07:15] when Israel
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; was mixed up
[2:07:21] with the teachings of the false prophet
[2:07:25] then he challenged them
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; said let's make a sacrifice
[2:07:32] And then you call
[2:07:35] fire from heaven to burn the sacrifice.
[2:07:40] I will also make my own
[2:07:44] then called the fire.
[2:07:46] You know what he did? After they failed,
[2:07:50] he restored everything.
[2:07:52] many took out their their what they have
[2:07:56] made their ark
[2:07:59] and then Elijah put his own
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; and restored everything according to
[2:08:05] order.
[2:08:10] If everything is according to order,
[2:08:15] there's no way that God could not answer
[2:08:17] it.
[2:08:21] Brother says,
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; "If you want to corner God,
[2:08:28] corner him on his promises
[2:08:33] because he will never shift from his
[2:08:35] promises."
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; If the ministry
[2:08:43] is in line with the word of God,
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; you don't struggle.
[2:08:51] you got because it it is of God
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; and even when you present it
[2:08:59] you don't even shout people and SAY
[2:09:05] no you don't you don't
[2:09:08] because they are part of that
[2:09:11] and they attracted of that
[2:09:15] you're just reminding
[2:09:19] Are we together?
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; So, paragraph 42 says,
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; "We find also that Joshua knowing his
[2:09:28] commission,
[2:09:32] knowing that it laid in his hand
[2:09:39] that God had called him for a duty
[2:09:44] that he must not fail.
[2:09:48] God can never call a bride
[2:09:52] that is scared of failing.
[2:09:57] Amen.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; If you are the bride,
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; you are the word.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; The word cannot fade.
[2:10:08] There's nothing that will scare you
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; if if there is any
[2:10:17] MINISTRY
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; that can over
[2:10:22] derail
[2:10:26] the the the right ministry
[2:10:30] then it will be contradiction.
[2:10:34] God set out
[2:10:37] the right ministry.
[2:10:39] He's duty bound to support that
[2:10:41] ministry.
[2:10:43] As long
[2:10:46] as we move with it as
[2:10:51] the baton
[2:10:52] was with Moses. Moses gave it over
[2:10:57] to
[2:11:00] Joshua. Amen. And the B and the the
[2:11:02] prophet says
[2:11:04] the Joshua
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; knowing this commission
[2:11:10] the bride knows their commission
[2:11:14] knowing that it is laid in his hand.
[2:11:20] He is responsible.
[2:11:24] The wedge is now in the bride.
[2:11:28] [applause and cheering] That makes that
[2:11:30] makes you
[2:11:32] responsible.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; It
[2:11:39] right that laid in his hand and that God
[2:11:42] had called him for a duty
[2:11:47] that he must not fail.
[2:11:52] Look, if it's God that has given me a
[2:11:56] duty,
[2:11:58] I'd be very happy.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; I know that now his word can never fail.
[2:12:07] And if his word CAN NEVER FAIL AND THEN
[2:12:09] HE USES ME, I'LL BE PROUD OF my God.
[2:12:16] Amen. [cheering and applause]
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; And then he says he walked softly before
[2:12:19] God.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Just like Enoch
[2:12:25] walked softly before God
[2:12:29] just like Abraham.
[2:12:31] Abraham walk softly
[2:12:35] until he became God himself.
[2:12:41] He walked softly.
[2:12:44] Bible says he walked with God,
[2:12:47] communicated with God as they were
[2:12:50] communicating.
[2:12:52] They found each other. We are of the
[2:12:55] same rod.
[2:12:58] When Peter
[2:13:00] met Jesus, they started communicating.
[2:13:04] They're of the same rock,
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; right? He is the rock.
[2:13:11] If he's a rock, little stone Peter,
[2:13:15] you come out of that rock.
[2:13:18] And when you come out of that, when you
[2:13:21] start communing with him,
[2:13:24] walking with him is communing with him.
[2:13:29] That's why brother Brandham said, "Have
[2:13:31] you met?"
[2:13:34] Because Abraham
[2:13:37] COMMUNICATED WITH GOD IN THEIR
[2:13:40] COMMUNICATION.
[2:13:42] Abraham
[2:13:44] found his position in that ROCK
[2:13:49] and all AND ALL AND ALL.
[2:13:52] HE PAUL FOUND HIS POSITION
[2:13:56] and when HE FOUND HIS POSITION there was
[2:13:59] no more turning back.
[2:14:01] HE WILL FIGHT
[2:14:03] UNTIL HE SAYS I HAVE ATTAINED.
[2:14:09] I even know myself
[2:14:13] in heaven
[2:14:15] right inside heaven.
[2:14:17] I SAW myself there. I kept quiet for 40
[2:14:21] YEARS
[2:14:23] BECAUSE NOBODY CAN BELIEVE ME.
[2:14:26] THAT IS WHY says when the seventh seat
[2:14:29] opened
[2:14:31] it was
[2:14:33] silence.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; Who can believe you?
[2:14:38] If you say to him,
[2:14:41] I was in Mount Transfiguration.
[2:14:45] I saw this man which is called Jesus
[2:14:49] transformed
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; and he was with Moses and he was with
[2:14:55] Elijah.
[2:14:57] They will say no you are out of your
[2:14:59] mind. So the best is to keep quiet.
[2:15:04] Why did brother Brennan
[2:15:07] after God
[2:15:10] has opened up the seven seal
[2:15:13] then he took to reveal them?
[2:15:18] Brother Brenham revealed them.
[2:15:21] Why did he say
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; it is in me?
[2:15:29] Amen.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; He never tried to explain.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:15:35] he said I feel checked.
[2:15:38] I've explained I've explained the first
[2:15:40] pool.
[2:15:43] I've explained the second pool. This one
[2:15:46] it's my revelation.
[2:15:50] Right. Amen.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; And why did he say the word is now in
[2:15:56] the bride and the bride knows what to DO
[2:16:00] ABOUT IT?
[2:16:02] Because God thus said the Lord.
[2:16:07] You can read the book of seals
[2:16:10] especially the seventh seal. I want to
[2:16:13] understand
[2:16:15] when when we reach a point where we say
[2:16:17] yeah there it is now. There it is now.
[2:16:19] There it is. Now
[2:16:22] then you would say I think I must stop
[2:16:26] here.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Because
[2:16:35] you each and every one of you
[2:16:39] have to walk with God
[2:16:42] until he finds himself.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Joshua
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; said his duty that he must not fail.
[2:17:00] That is why our pastor
[2:17:04] made sure
[2:17:06] before he departed that he must not
[2:17:09] fail.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. He was sure of him.
[2:17:17] He walked softly before God.
[2:17:21] And Joshua when he called the people
[2:17:23] together
[2:17:26] and told them that God had commissioned
[2:17:28] him,
[2:17:31] watch the request of the people.
[2:17:37] They said,
[2:17:39] "We'll follow you as we did Moses.
[2:17:45] If we can see the same thing that
[2:17:48] followed Moses,
[2:17:54] it doesn't have to be a person.
[2:17:57] It has to be the thing
[2:18:01] that that is in him. Not not a person.
[2:18:05] Now they are not looking at Joshua as
[2:18:07] such.
[2:18:10] They looking at the thing
[2:18:12] that was in Moses. They can't take any
[2:18:15] other thing.
[2:18:18] But they said to him,
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; only
[2:18:22] be strong
[2:18:26] and courageous.
[2:18:30] You cannot do the right thing
[2:18:33] when you are scared. When you don't have
[2:18:36] courage, when you know that what you're
[2:18:38] doing is right,
[2:18:41] that that thing makes you strong,
[2:18:44] that makes you courageous
[2:18:47] because we know that you have the
[2:18:49] eternal thing.
[2:18:52] Are we together?
[2:18:55] Amen.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; So now what is our inheritance
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; and uh uh
[2:19:03] how did we lost it?
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says here
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; uh the bridge between the seven church
[2:19:16] ages and the seven saints.
[2:19:21] It says Adam lost his inheritance.
[2:19:28] Adam lost his inheritance.
[2:19:33] He's our father. He's our grandparent.
[2:19:38] He lost it.
[2:19:40] It is supposed to be ours.
[2:19:44] When your father has got something,
[2:19:48] know that it's your inheritance.
[2:19:53] And if he mess up with that,
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; there's nothing that you're going to
[2:19:58] inherit
[2:20:00] because your father mess it up.
[2:20:05] Are we together?
[2:20:08] Amen.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Now, our great great parents
[2:20:15] He says Adam lo what is that
[2:20:17] inheritance?
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Adam lost his inheritance.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; The earth
[2:20:30] the earth.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Now it passed from his hand
[2:20:38] to the one he sold to the other one.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; He sold out to Satan.
[2:20:49] We are the inheritance of this earth.
[2:20:55] I will explain. He sold his faith in
[2:20:59] God's
[2:21:02] Yeah. He sold his faith in God
[2:21:06] to No. No. He Yeah. Yeah. He He sold his
[2:21:10] faith in God.
[2:21:13] Now he sold it to
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Satan. Amen.
[2:21:19] He was supposed to have faith in God,
[2:21:24] but he sold it
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; to the devil.
[2:21:28] Therefore, his eternal life His
[2:21:33] right to the tree of life,
[2:21:37] his right to the earth
[2:21:41] that belonged to him.
[2:21:44] And he forated every
[2:21:48] to the hands of Satan,
[2:21:53] his right
[2:21:55] to eternal life.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; His right to the tree of life.
[2:22:01] his right
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; to the earth.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; Those things belong to him.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; And he forfeated every bit
[2:22:13] to the hands of the devil.
[2:22:17] Are we together?
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; So now where where is our inheritance?
[2:22:25] Was in the hands of the devil.
[2:22:29] He passeth from his hand to the devil.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Therefore, now
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; it has been
[2:22:42] it has sorry it has been it returned and
[2:22:45] he has been polluted
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; and the seed of Adam has destroyed the
[2:22:53] inheritance that Adam should have had.
[2:23:00] That's the earth.
[2:23:03] That's the seed of Adam.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; Now, if you read this book,
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; uh, the Revelation
[2:23:16] chapter 5 part two,
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Revelation 5 part two,
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; paragraph 73.
[2:23:23] Remember it's an old testament but we're
[2:23:25] going to explain that that thing now he
[2:23:28] lost everything
[2:23:31] and remember our title
[2:23:34] has to do with the inheritance and
[2:23:38] possession and at the same time our our
[2:23:42] text
[2:23:44] beware
[2:23:46] of the delaying
[2:23:48] process Yes.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; Right. Paragraph uh where I said we're
[2:23:59] reading from Yeah. paragraph 73 says
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; the next few weeks. All right. So right
[2:24:07] the next few weeks of teaching will be
[2:24:09] based upon redemption.
[2:24:13] That's brother saying that.
[2:24:16] It says, see, upon redemption, not upon
[2:24:20] justification,
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; not not upon justification.
[2:24:31] It's based on redemption. Redeeming what
[2:24:34] is yours,
[2:24:38] right? Amen.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Not upon mediatoral.
[2:24:47] of intercession
[2:24:50] but upon redeemed.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Any inheritance that was lost or for
[2:24:59] fated and has been redeemed back to us.
[2:25:02] AMEN.
[2:25:07] Has returned back to us again.
[2:25:12] and how it all come about
[2:25:17] and how God planned it before there ever
[2:25:20] was a WORLD
[2:25:24] and how secure the church is anchored.
[2:25:31] That's what he says. This shows
[2:25:35] how secured
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; the church anchor.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; I think it come to a time when we got to
[2:25:47] know
[2:25:49] how we stand.
[2:25:58] Are we together? Amen. It's come a time
[2:26:02] where one have to know
[2:26:05] where we stand.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; And how can we do anything
[2:26:13] unless you've got faith
[2:26:17] in what you are doing
[2:26:20] where you stand
[2:26:22] there's nothing that you can do
[2:26:24] if you don't have faith on what you are
[2:26:26] doing.
[2:26:29] You got to have faith.
[2:26:32] And that's my purpose of doing this with
[2:26:35] the church here
[2:26:40] is to give the believers faith,
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; confidence
[2:26:48] on what they are standing for
[2:26:52] because it is the word of the Lord.
[2:26:56] Now if it's the word of the Lord,
[2:26:59] Now he says now must give the believers
[2:27:04] faith
[2:27:05] on what they believe and what they are
[2:27:08] standing on
[2:27:10] because that is the way this
[2:27:13] as long as
[2:27:16] through the scriptures sovereignty
[2:27:19] please
[2:27:24] it is the sovereign
[2:27:27] placed by scripture.
[2:27:31] from Genesis to Revelation,
[2:27:34] back and forth,
[2:27:37] up and down,
[2:27:39] and a way for the devil to move and not
[2:27:42] a way for the devil to move in there
[2:27:45] anywhere.
[2:27:49] Amen. He says from Genesis
[2:27:53] to Revelation up down and everything
[2:27:59] there is no way as long as it is the
[2:28:03] sovereignty of the word
[2:28:06] and that sovereignty of the word we take
[2:28:09] it by faith.
[2:28:12] There is no intervention.
[2:28:15] There is no incarnation.
[2:28:21] But the devil
[2:28:23] intervened
[2:28:25] when one has got a doubt in the word of
[2:28:27] God.
[2:28:31] That's how we lost our inheritance.
[2:28:35] The Lord said, "Let us make man in our
[2:28:41] image."
[2:28:43] Amen.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says,
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; he didn't say, "Let us make amen."
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let us make men."
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; That man
[2:28:58] that he said we should make,
[2:29:02] he must
[2:29:04] he said that man,
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; male and female
[2:29:10] created he them.
[2:29:12] Then he said, "God will CALL HIS
[2:29:15] CHILDREN FROM THE DUST of the earth."
[2:29:19] NOW
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; THAT is the man
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; that he spoke about
[2:29:26] before he made man out of the dust of
[2:29:29] the earth.
[2:29:33] You know, if if if if you read the book
[2:29:36] of Ezekiel 28,
[2:29:38] you'll find him speaking about the
[2:29:42] garden of Eden
[2:29:47] in heaven.
[2:29:50] Now, everything was done in heaven.
[2:29:54] Here on earth, it's just those things
[2:29:57] that are manifested.
[2:30:01] All those things were in the mind of
[2:30:03] course but
[2:30:06] that's how it is.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; So then
[2:30:12] he says here what I was reading here
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; now
[2:30:21] the for fated title deed is now in the
[2:30:24] hands of the original owner.
[2:30:28] Remember
[2:30:33] we read uh Revelation 5 verse one.
[2:30:39] We will go to that one. But but what is
[2:30:42] going on here?
[2:30:43] You have to be careful.
[2:30:46] We are talking about losing
[2:30:50] the earth
[2:30:52] and the way to the tree of life
[2:30:56] etc etc.
[2:30:58] But the title did
[2:31:01] went back to the owner.
[2:31:04] Yes, we lost it.
[2:31:07] But it was not in the dirty hands of the
[2:31:10] devil.
[2:31:14] We lost the earth. We lost the the tree
[2:31:17] of life. Going to the tree of life.
[2:31:21] But the title did.
[2:31:24] Okay, let me read that one. Amen.
[2:31:28] He says uh uh paragraph 116.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; He says sorry now therefore faith that
[2:31:40] titled deed is now in the hands of the
[2:31:43] original owner
[2:31:48] almighty God.
[2:31:50] the title did to the earth
[2:31:55] and to eternal life.
[2:31:58] When Adam forfeated it,
[2:32:02] then Satan's dirty hands could not take
[2:32:04] it.
[2:32:09] It went back to the original owner,
[2:32:13] God himself.
[2:32:16] He says, "Now, we're going to find it
[2:32:18] back in a minute.
[2:32:21] Right. Verse paragraph 117.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; What is it doing in the hands of God?
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; In the hands of God, waiting for the
[2:32:33] redemption claim.
[2:32:38] Remember, I'm talking about a thing that
[2:32:40] has already happened.
[2:32:44] That's why I went back to the I mean to
[2:32:46] the Old Testament.
[2:32:49] So it says now
[2:32:51] God is waiting for the claim
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; of which it has already done.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; He made a way of redemption.
[2:33:03] He made a way back in some
[2:33:07] someday
[2:33:09] the redeemer is to take it back.
[2:33:14] Remember he has already taken it back.
[2:33:17] Amen.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; So when when when he was saying these
[2:33:20] things,
[2:33:22] the seals were not yet open.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 1 118 says, "What is the book
[2:33:31] of redemption?
[2:33:35] This title did
[2:33:39] the abstract title did
[2:33:47] There's a title deed.
[2:33:51] There is an abstract title.
[2:33:56] Amen.
[2:33:58] A title D. We already know what is it.
[2:34:03] When you've got your title D
[2:34:06] of your house,
[2:34:09] it doesn't tell you the story,
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; but the abstract
[2:34:15] It will tell you that house was the
[2:34:19] first owner was
[2:34:23] the second one was kosana.
[2:34:26] The third one was
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; that is the abstract
[2:34:34] says now
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; uh
[2:34:38] Satan's dead hand
[2:34:42] could not take it. It went back to the
[2:34:45] original.
[2:34:47] Now in 118 it says now
[2:34:52] what is the book of redemption?
[2:34:55] This title did
[2:34:59] abstract title corrects IT
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; and he says you say abstract
[2:35:10] abstract.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; What does an abstract mean?
[2:35:14] It means it's such all the way back to
[2:35:17] the beginningise.
[2:35:22] like that. Like like that little drop of
[2:35:25] ink
[2:35:29] this morning when it struck the bleach,
[2:35:33] it went all the way back.
[2:35:36] And when sin has been confessed
[2:35:40] and fallen into the blood of Jesus
[2:35:43] Christ,
[2:35:45] it gives an abstract
[2:35:49] right straight back to the creator.
[2:35:54] I'm about to close
[2:35:57] as I've said now I'm just laying on that
[2:35:59] one.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Then it's legal position to the
[2:36:06] abstract
[2:36:14] title deed of eternal life
[2:36:19] means that you possess everything that
[2:36:23] Adam and Eve lost.
[2:36:29] The position of that deed
[2:36:35] Are
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; we together?
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; It's redemption. And it redemption means
[2:36:41] all legal position.
[2:36:48] All that was lost by Adam.
[2:36:54] What that ought to do,
[2:36:57] you have to start by being born again.
[2:37:01] Then that gives you a legal position
[2:37:06] to that abstract deed
[2:37:09] title deed of eternal life
[2:37:12] means that you possess everything that
[2:37:19] title deed
[2:37:22] of eternal life.
[2:37:24] Imagine. Amen. Title date of eternal
[2:37:27] life.
[2:37:31] Are we together?
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; Now when we speak about Joshua's
[2:37:37] &gt;&gt; giving us our inheritance,
[2:37:40] we're getting our eternal life
[2:37:45] and then we rest assure.
[2:37:51] So it's just that now you cannot say to
[2:37:54] somebody go and peep to heaven and come
[2:37:56] back.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; But if you can just take somebody
[2:38:05] and say let him peep
[2:38:08] and come back will never be the same.
[2:38:12] And it it's just that now you cannot say
[2:38:15] can you just peep the other side of
[2:38:18] death
[2:38:22] then come back you'll tell us another
[2:38:24] story.
[2:38:26] I went and peeped
[2:38:29] by his grace I find that
[2:38:33] whatever is happening here
[2:38:36] it's none and void.
[2:38:41] There's nothing that is yours here.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. Just by peeping
[2:38:49] and coming back.
[2:38:51] I didn't even know how to repent.
[2:38:55] Didn't know how to repent. And even when
[2:38:58] I repented,
[2:39:00] I was not sure whether I'm waiting for
[2:39:01] it.
[2:39:05] That's what now our Joshua's are
[2:39:07] restoring to us. AMEN.
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; There's nothing here on earth that
[2:39:17] belongs to us.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; The devil
[2:39:26] is in possession.
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But our inheritance
[2:39:33] belongs to us. Let me read you that one.
[2:39:37] and our inheritance
[2:39:39] belong to us.
[2:39:42] It's your privilege
[2:39:47] to have anything that you inherited.
[2:39:56] It's your privilege.
[2:39:59] Adam forfeated the title
[2:40:02] to Satan.
[2:40:05] Now in that fall,
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; Adam
[2:40:10] fored the title to that.
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; He forfeated to Satan.
[2:40:18] Satan and Adam was very slothful
[2:40:24] and he did not redeem his rights for he
[2:40:27] could he could not redeem his right.
[2:40:34] Satan
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; is the god of this earth.
[2:40:40] Go and read it. Luke chapter 4
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; verse 57 verse 5-7.
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; He is the God of this earth.
[2:40:52] But ours is not this one,
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; not this one. Read it, my brother.
[2:41:02] Luke chapter 4 verse 5. And the devil
[2:41:06] taking him up into a high mountain
[2:41:08] showed unto him all the kingdoms of the
[2:41:11] world in a moment of time. And the devil
[2:41:15] said unto him, "All this power will I
[2:41:17] give thee, and the glory of them, for
[2:41:21] that is delivered unto me."
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; Is delivered unto me.
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; Who delivered it to the devil?
[2:41:31] It's Adam.
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; He can stand before God and challenge
[2:41:38] him.
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; It was given to me.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. I I got it from Adam.
[2:41:45] You said,
[2:41:47] multiply,
[2:41:49] apprentice the land. He didn't believe
[2:41:51] you.
[2:41:52] Now I said
[2:41:54] you were not telling the truth.
[2:41:58] So no, he believed me instead of you.
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; So it's given to me.
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; He can claim it.
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; Right? Satan is the god of this earth.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; But Satan does not rightfully own it.
[2:42:24] &gt;&gt; But he possesses
[2:42:29] He is the God of the earth.
[2:42:32] That's what the Bible says.
[2:42:35] Are
[2:42:35] &gt;&gt; we together?
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; He said it's given to me.
[2:42:42] Now do you get Satan possessed that? He
[2:42:45] holds it in his hand.
[2:42:50] Death in his hand.
[2:42:53] Death in his hand.
[2:42:57] the earth in his hand.
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; The world belongs to him.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; The earth and the world, you know,
[2:43:07] every nation belongs to him.
[2:43:11] He governs.
[2:43:13] He controls the whole world
[2:43:16] and everything in the world.
[2:43:21] But
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; thank God.
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; We are not of the world.
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:34] &gt;&gt; I don't mean the church. He doesn't
[2:43:36] control the church.
[2:43:39] He controls the world.
[2:43:42] He he said they were his
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; and he's the god of the world.
[2:43:52] &gt;&gt; You know that he said that.
[2:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:55] &gt;&gt; So he for Adam forfeated the title did
[2:44:03] but when he forfeated it went to God.
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[2:44:10] So but we own it
[2:44:14] &gt;&gt; right now. Now our ministry now
[2:44:18] as you would see in the afternoon
[2:44:22] uh we our title did come back to us
[2:44:30] as a ministry
[2:44:33] as the word of God
[2:44:37] and as an assurance.
[2:44:40] That is why we
[2:44:44] are the bride.
[2:44:46] We are the one. Look,
[2:44:49] brother Brennham says
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; Adam,
[2:44:56] our first Adam
[2:44:59] had a bride.
[2:45:02] before he could know the bride,
[2:45:07] the bride was already pregnant.
[2:45:12] The second Adam which is Jesus
[2:45:18] had a church.
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; Before he could adopt that church,
[2:45:26] it was already pregnant
[2:45:28] with dogmas,
[2:45:31] wrong doctrine.
[2:45:33] That's why he he left it
[2:45:38] and came to you and
[2:45:43] the the the the the group
[2:45:48] that is elected
[2:45:50] for a good purpose.
[2:45:54] That's what makes you a bride.
[2:45:58] Not a church.
[2:46:01] Then he marries you. That is why he said
[2:46:05] the word is now in the bride.
[2:46:08] We are married by him.
[2:46:10] because
[2:46:12] you had faith
[2:46:16] in the word it.
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:46:21] &gt;&gt; Now in closing
[2:46:23] I am saying
[2:46:25] there is a ministry that is relevant
[2:46:30] and if that ministry is relevant
[2:46:35] any other ministry
[2:46:40] It's in vain.
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; It's a sermon.
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; It's a ministry.
[2:46:51] &gt;&gt; It has got its own doctrine.
[2:46:54] It has it its own anointing.
[2:46:59] But you can't reach your destination.
[2:47:05] The at the moment
[2:47:07] the ministry is of the revealed way
[2:47:12] and the revealed way
[2:47:14] is nothing else.
[2:47:17] Christ himself.
[2:47:19] And if Christ him is a revealed way,
[2:47:24] that's what will give you a rapture
[2:47:29] because
[2:47:31] it's himself
[2:47:33] that will find a place in your heart.
[2:47:37] When you find a place in your he will
[2:47:40] whisper
[2:47:42] to you as an individual.
[2:47:46] And when you whisper to you as an
[2:47:48] individual,
[2:47:50] you are the only one that will be
[2:47:51] convinced.
[2:47:55] There's nobody else that can convince
[2:47:56] him.
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we are the only one that will be
[2:48:01] convinced
[2:48:03] by the whispering.
[2:48:06] As I've already said that, brother
[2:48:09] Brennham said, "Have you met me?"
[2:48:14] He said I have met.
[2:48:17] That is why he says now who is this mec
[2:48:22] in other words he was say I am that mec
[2:48:25] and then you can be that
[2:48:28] who is meedced
[2:48:30] is Christed.
[2:48:32] You are Christ because in the beginning
[2:48:36] was the word. The word was with God. The
[2:48:40] word is God.
[2:48:42] And that word came and put on a flesh
[2:48:47] &gt;&gt; and became man. That is it. Amen.
[2:48:51] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. [applause]
[2:48:54] Amen.
[2:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. You can come. God
[2:49:03] bless you.
[2:49:07] Thanks.
[2:49:09] Would
[2:49:26] you
