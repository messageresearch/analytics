[33:08] Before

[33:14] we want to invite him to come
[33:18] and lead the program for us.
[33:24] like to invite Pastor Freddy
[33:27] to come and lead us in prayer
[33:32] for us to start our
[33:36] today's procession.
[33:40] I heard that there is uh brother Mark
[33:43] around. Maybe he can come
[33:48] if he can help us to
[33:52] interpret for us the prayer
[33:55] from our beloved pastor.
[34:08] We shall pray.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Father, which is in heaven,
[34:19] &gt;&gt; we are touched within ourselves.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; At the same time, we have the feeling of
[34:29] gratefulness
[34:32] &gt;&gt; because you are God.
[34:38] We are gathered here this morning
[34:44] &gt;&gt; for the funeral of your servant Israel.
[34:49] [music]
[34:51] When he was in your council,
[34:56] he experienced things
[35:01] and he decide he decided of things
[35:06] and he fixed of many things
[35:14] until you suffer that he assumes a human
[35:18] body.
[35:23] And here before us we have this body in
[35:26] the coffin.
[35:30] The person within this coffin is not a
[35:33] him
[35:38] but a him. The true him is the one that
[35:41] had been with you in your council.
[35:47] He decided to come and dwell in this
[35:51] body
[35:54] to leave a time that he that was
[35:57] allotted for him on this earth.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Him that was a supernatural being.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; He that was a supernatural being.
[36:14] He came within this body in order to
[36:16] have an experience of this flesh, this
[36:19] body.
[36:22] Since the first day he came into this
[36:24] world,
[36:27] &gt;&gt; he started his journey here on earth
[36:32] up until the day he left the same body
[36:35] he lived in.
[36:39] And we've heard of the marvelous things,
[36:43] &gt;&gt; his character,
[36:46] &gt;&gt; the nature and the attitude, the
[36:49] sacrifice,
[36:50] &gt;&gt; the sacrifices.
[36:55] And every single one of here of us here,
[36:58] we recognize that he was sent by you,
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Lord our God.
[37:06] service.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; We would like to dedicate the service
[37:10] into your holy hands
[37:13] &gt;&gt; because uh it was not useless.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; He was never useless but he was always
[37:19] useful.
[37:22] He was useful for his biological family.
[37:26] Useful for
[37:31] useful even to all the other sister
[37:34] churches.
[37:38] and he did that which you purposed in
[37:40] your counsel.
[37:43] That's why we are so grateful to you
[37:46] and we are confident
[37:50] that in this long journey
[37:54] he is right now in a dimension
[38:00] in a dimension where there's no case
[38:02] there's no worries
[38:04] where there's no pains
[38:08] where sickness cannot creep in.
[38:11] He is right now in the glory. He is in a
[38:14] joy.
[38:16] He is in a feast.
[38:20] But we that are left here on earth,
[38:24] we have griefs.
[38:28] But through the teachings that he left
[38:30] us,
[38:32] all the teachings they comfort us
[38:35] and we have the assurance
[38:37] that one of these days
[38:40] we will go to meeting up with you
[38:43] and that shall be a great joy.
[38:47] That's the reason why we're calling upon
[38:48] your name. We're calling upon your
[38:50] presence
[38:53] and we pray that everything that shall
[38:55] be done, let them be done under your
[38:57] control from the beginning to the end in
[39:01] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[39:04] have so prayed and asked for your glory.

[39:28] welcoming words.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Beloved family.
[39:44] Beloved family.
[39:49] All the pastors, the dear pastors
[39:54] in the house,
[39:59] all the elders of the church.
[40:06] We would like to greet you this morning
[40:09] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[40:15] We extend these greetings [snorts]
[40:20] to al the body of Christ
[40:25] who are connected to this event
[40:31] from all the corners.
[40:37] We also honor
[40:41] &gt;&gt; the invisible
[40:45] audience
[40:50] and the heavenly host [snorts] that are
[40:52] with us this morning.
[40:58] We have gathered here today
[41:03] with hearts that feel both heavy and
[41:08] deeply grateful.
[41:16] heavy because we have lost
[41:21] a father,
[41:24] &gt;&gt; a husband,
[41:27] &gt;&gt; a grandfather,
[41:30] &gt;&gt; a leader,
[41:33] &gt;&gt; a brother,
[41:34] &gt;&gt; a brother,
[41:36] &gt;&gt; a shepherd
[41:38] and a pillar among us.
[41:44] grateful because God gave us the
[41:46] privilege
[41:51] to walk with a man like Pastor Israel.
[41:59] Pastor Israel Kodima was more than a
[42:02] pastor.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[42:15] &gt;&gt; To many of us
[42:18] he was a mentor
[42:21] to others a counselor
[42:26] to many more a father in the faith.
[42:32] He was a man who built people.
[42:38] who believed in potential even when
[42:41] people did not yet look like anything.
[42:49] He built a ministry from nothing to
[42:52] something that today stands strong
[43:02] to something that is impactful.
[43:07] visible
[43:10] and undeniable.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; We are witnesses
[43:17] of the fruits of his labor.
[43:23] He was a pioneer,
[43:28] a man who walked path that had not been
[43:31] walked.
[43:36] He faced battles many would have run
[43:39] away from
[43:44] but he did not retreat.
[43:48] And we want to tell this morning
[43:52] that we will also not retreat.
[43:59] He fought with wisdom.
[44:04] He fought without wasting ammunition.
[44:10] He understood timing,
[44:14] discernment,
[44:16] and obedience.
[44:19] He didn't fight to be seen.
[44:24] He fought because he believed that the
[44:27] kingdom of God served his life,
[44:35] his strength and even his tears.
[44:41] Yes,
[44:42] he sacrificed much.
[44:47] He gave of himself
[44:50] sometime more than what we could see.
[44:56] He placed the work of God above personal
[45:00] comfort.
[45:04] He carried burden so other could stand
[45:08] free.
[45:12] I can say he was a deliverer.
[45:22] He paid prices that only heaven can
[45:26] fully record.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; He finally shared him with the world.
[45:40] He finally he his family shared him with
[45:43] the world.
[45:47] and for that sacrifice.
[45:51] We honor them today
[45:56] [applause]
[45:58] and that is with deep respect.
[46:06] Pastor Israel taught us not only by his
[46:10] preaching,
[46:15] but by his life,
[46:19] the way he served,
[46:23] the way he forgave,
[46:27] the way he loved,
[46:30] the way he disciplined himself. His
[46:35] life was a message.
[46:43] [applause]
[46:45] He woke, his work was a sermon.
[46:52] His behavior was a mentorship school.
[46:59] We learned by watching him.
[47:05] As we always say,
[47:09] life of great men
[47:13] has taught us.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; The legacy that he leave behind him is
[47:21] is one of that we cannot afford to
[47:24] compromise.
[47:32] I want to repeat that.
[47:34] The legacy that he leaves behind
[47:40] is one that we cannot afford to
[47:43] compromise.
[47:50] It is a foundation that demands
[47:53] continuation,
[47:58] not imitation.
[48:02] It calls us to stand,
[48:06] to build,
[48:08] to love,
[48:10] and to serve
[48:13] as he did
[48:17] to carry forward the vision
[48:21] that outlives any one person.
[48:28] So today,
[48:30] even as we feel the pain of loss,
[48:37] we also stand in honor.
[48:43] We honor a general in faith,
[48:51] a father among fathers.
[48:58] A leader who led with integrity.
[49:07] Thank you.
[49:10] A servant who never sought a throne.
[49:18] As we begin this service,
[49:22] let our hearts not only moon
[49:28] but also celebrate.
[49:32] Celebrate a welllived life.
[49:38] Celebrate the soul.
[49:44] Thank you Jesus.
[49:46] Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Celebrate the souls he touched.
[49:52] Celebrate the ministry he built.
[49:59] Celebrate the God he faithfully served.
[50:07] May the God of all comfort be with us
[50:10] today.
[50:14] May his peace rest upon the family.
[50:20] May his spirit lead us as we continue to
[50:24] walk in the legacy of Pastor Israel
[50:28] Kodima.
[50:32] [music]
[50:36] God bless you.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[50:43] &gt;&gt; I wanted to welcome the audience with
[50:45] these few words
[50:50] and I believe that we will have a great
[50:52] time together
[50:56] to pay a great tribute to our great
[51:01] general in faith.
[51:05] Just for protocol
[51:10] I have been given a program here to run.
[51:16] We will try to stick to our program
[51:21] and make sure we keep time.
[51:25] We will have uh various friends
[51:30] and items
[51:34] that will come here
[51:36] just to help us stand strong.
[51:41] We insist that each one who will take
[51:44] the pulpit here
[51:49] to respect this moment with us.
[51:55] Shalom.
[52:02] Let me start by asking in the audience
[52:05] here all the pastors
[52:10] if they can just stand on their feet
[52:15] so that we may notice them
[52:20] and welcome them with umbrella of
[52:23] applaud.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[52:32] &gt;&gt; May God bless you men of God
[52:36] for coming to honor this moment.
[52:50] for these tributes that we are paying
[52:55] for his wonderful life.
[53:01] We want to thank you.
[53:03] May God bless you richly.
[53:07] You may take your seat.
[53:09] We understand.
[53:14] We understand that we may not be able to
[53:17] call all of you here
[53:21] for the sake of time,
[53:24] but we know that your presence here is a
[53:27] blessing unto us.
[53:31] We want also
[53:34] if I can do that to ask the the family,
[53:41] the children of the pastor
[53:44] our mother
[53:47] and the grandchildren just
[53:50] so that the rest of the audience can
[53:54] notice them
[53:57] as we are beginning the service.
[54:00] Everyone who's here already.
[54:02] Okay, those that are there can stand.
[54:11] God bless you.
[54:13] Amen.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; You know, like we always say, we pastors
[54:22] &gt;&gt; that sometimes a church can replace a
[54:25] pastor,
[54:28] but a home cannot replace a father.
[54:35] We want to be here in support of this
[54:37] family.
[54:41] We want also to appreciate the elders of
[54:44] Mamelo Church
[54:48] for the great ministry that they have
[54:51] helped to drive
[54:56] and the entire church
[55:00] that has been pastored by pastor Israel
[55:03] Kodima.
[55:06] Just give a round of applause for
[55:07] yourself. Before

[55:14] I get to my next item,
[55:18] my next uh speaker,
[55:21] I want to invite Sister Mete,
[55:26] if she's ready
[55:29] to come and give us a song item
[55:33] as we proceed.
[55:38] Is she ready?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, let's get
[55:51] while she's getting ready the voice of
[55:55] an eagle.

[1:33:29] condition.
[1:33:33] Amen.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh I think
[1:33:38] we can get to the next speech.
[1:33:43] Uh let's hear from the pastors,
[1:33:48] doctors and nurses.
[1:33:55] I know they have a great testimony to
[1:33:58] say
[1:34:02] the pastor's doctor
[1:34:06] and nurses
[1:34:08] if they are ready
[1:34:12] they can come forth
[1:34:16] sister Tomi
[1:34:18] and sister pi sister
[1:34:27] They have witnessed
[1:34:32] the progress of the pastor
[1:34:37] and we want to hear their testimony
[1:34:41] in the five minutes that we are giving
[1:34:44] them.
[1:34:53] Greetings.
[1:34:59] The one speaking is the nurse who was
[1:35:01] taking care of
[1:35:07] I met first at MRI
[1:35:11] clinic
[1:35:17] and then I was then nurse.
[1:35:21] connection and I had a connection.
[1:35:27] There was no other nurse that she wanted
[1:35:29] but me.
[1:35:35] He was a humble or a righteous man.
[1:35:41] A man who loves the people.
[1:35:47] He was the patient that we loved the
[1:35:48] most and he also loved us.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; He was a very wise man.
[1:35:58] He was able to lead your thoughts when
[1:36:00] you coming to him.
[1:36:09] He's someone who would guide you if you
[1:36:10] do something that he doesn't want. He
[1:36:13] would bring you something else.
[1:36:15] So he was a humble man.
[1:36:24] I was with him as a man of jokes.
[1:36:29] I was a nurse at clinic.
[1:36:37] The way he loved me, the family even
[1:36:39] went on to request me to take care of
[1:36:41] him at home.
[1:36:44] I was also taking care of him at home.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; The last time I saw him, it was when he
[1:36:55] was admitted at ministry.
[1:37:01] I then saw his family outside.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; I was told that he was admitted in the
[1:37:08] EU.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; I went to greet him again.
[1:37:20] The reason I stopped going home to take
[1:37:22] care of him
[1:37:29] wedding,
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; I was getting married. I had to go and
[1:37:33] do some preparation for a white wedding.
[1:37:46] I requested the family that because I am
[1:37:48] I'm about to get married, I would like
[1:37:49] to go on with the preparations
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; and then stop going to going to their
[1:37:56] home
[1:38:00] and they called me back again at
[1:38:02] Ministry
[1:38:08] and I were making arrangement that I go
[1:38:10] back home.
[1:38:13] That's when I met
[1:38:17] at midstream when he was in ECU.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; He was happy to see me. He said, and
[1:38:26] then I said to him, are you used to call
[1:38:29] him?
[1:38:32] He always had a smile.
[1:38:36] I say to family,
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; it's it's not the end.
[1:38:45] May God comfort you.
[1:38:49] Wonderful man.
[1:38:58] I was also saddened to hear that left
[1:39:00] us.
[1:39:03] I am deeply hurt.
[1:39:06] I do not have much.
[1:39:08] I am just head.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; I say be comforted you.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; I will then go sit down.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; God bless you. [applause]
[1:39:24] Is sister also coming?
[1:39:29] Sister is she coming?
[1:39:35] Then let me have Dr. Dr. Mab
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Dr. Matabi
[1:40:13] I I greet you this morning
[1:40:16] in the wonderful name of our Lord and
[1:40:18] Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Special greetings to the pastors.
[1:40:27] May the good Lord bless you.
[1:40:30] And I would like to greet all those
[1:40:32] grandfathers,
[1:40:35] grandmothers
[1:40:38] who when pastor they had his ministry,
[1:40:40] they were young people.
[1:40:45] But now
[1:40:47] they are old people.
[1:40:49] Those people are the kind of people who
[1:40:51] pass good messages
[1:40:55] managed to preserve them
[1:40:58] managed
[1:41:00] until now. And then also I greet also
[1:41:06] special greeting to those young people
[1:41:10] those ones who when they came into the
[1:41:12] ministry of pastor Kurima
[1:41:17] some of them were born in the message.
[1:41:20] Some of them were five seven years old
[1:41:22] like I I was
[1:41:26] but now
[1:41:28] they are husbands.
[1:41:31] uh wives,
[1:41:34] successful business people
[1:41:37] through the min ministry of pastor
[1:41:41] and also a special greeting
[1:41:44] to those young people.
[1:41:46] You know, miss you as transgenerational.
[1:41:50] That is why we have all
[1:41:53] this why we have all kinds of people,
[1:41:57] the young, the old, the middle-aged.
[1:42:03] Yes. So special preaches to those young
[1:42:05] people
[1:42:07] who through the teaching of pastor
[1:42:12] they you know brother says
[1:42:17] loudishia
[1:42:19] is the grandest of all ages.
[1:42:26] It is the most sinful age
[1:42:31] and because it is with the blending
[1:42:36] of time and eternity
[1:42:39] now through the ministration of pastor.
[1:42:43] He gave them the kind of ministry
[1:42:47] that could take them out of theian
[1:42:49] church age
[1:42:52] into the bride age.
[1:42:55] Yes. ministries that he used to preaches
[1:42:59] topics like
[1:43:02] end of the seven seal
[1:43:05] center point of the revelation
[1:43:07] center point of the revelation
[1:43:11] the flying interpretation
[1:43:14] getting to the extreme
[1:43:17] he is coming up
[1:43:21] going to where Melkisedc is
[1:43:25] So you are a wellfed church. You are a
[1:43:28] wellfed church.
[1:43:32] Well looked after
[1:43:35] through the you know sacrifice
[1:43:38] efforts
[1:43:40] hours of sacrifice that the pastor put
[1:43:44] you know I I I think I'm one of the
[1:43:46] people that he loved the most.
[1:43:50] I I see there's no amen there. But let
[1:43:52] me
[1:43:55] but as much as he loved me
[1:43:59] and as much as I loved him,
[1:44:02] he loved you just as much.
[1:44:05] So you are a privileged people.
[1:44:10] Now in those few words
[1:44:12] I would like to add my my talk about my
[1:44:16] acquaintances
[1:44:19] and my expressions about the pastor.
[1:44:23] You know he was my spiritual his
[1:44:26] physician
[1:44:30] for more than 40 years.
[1:44:34] I was his physical physician
[1:44:37] maybe for 15 years. about 15
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; now you can't compare
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; I remember there was a time when he came
[1:44:44] to me because I wish to see him at least
[1:44:47] monthly if not twice a month wouldn't
[1:44:50] pass without me see him
[1:44:57] now one day he says you know my son
[1:44:59] you've been coming here you know I I
[1:45:00] just wanted the the trusty to organize
[1:45:02] something for you
[1:45:07] because where I come from I traled 250
[1:45:10] coming
[1:45:13] back.
[1:45:15] But now it dawned on me and said, "Look,
[1:45:19] if my soul is worth 10,000 words,000
[1:45:25] now, how much will I how can I charge
[1:45:28] the pastor?
[1:45:30] How much
[1:45:32] if he can say you know your worth your
[1:45:35] soul is worth 10,000 words
[1:45:40] and I'm looking after you
[1:45:42] need to pay me.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; How much you know how much am I going to
[1:45:46] be able to pay you so I couldn't do it.
[1:45:50] So I just came there because of the love
[1:45:52] I had for him
[1:45:55] and the love he had for me.
[1:46:01] Amen. And me and him, we had a special
[1:46:03] bond.
[1:46:06] You know, we'll spend countless hours.
[1:46:09] I'll come to examine him.
[1:46:12] But I'll spend almost the whole day,
[1:46:15] maybe examine him for 30 minutes, the
[1:46:18] rest of the fellowshipping.
[1:46:22] So I count myself lucky
[1:46:26] very fortunate
[1:46:28] you know pastor
[1:46:30] his life you know everything about him
[1:46:33] was worth based
[1:46:39] based on the word of God
[1:46:42] even if you are a doctor to approach him
[1:46:46] must be according to the word if it's
[1:46:49] not according to the
[1:46:50] you wouldn't take it. Now that is why he
[1:46:53] was a difficult patient to manage.
[1:47:00] I I remember one day
[1:47:02] we he was tired. Then we decided uh
[1:47:07] no pastor I think you need to decrease
[1:47:09] your consultation.
[1:47:13] So he just looked at me. I said, "Oh,
[1:47:16] okay. All right. Okay." And then the
[1:47:19] next week
[1:47:21] he went into his office.
[1:47:23] The elders have put a note there.
[1:47:26] Today we are going to have a few
[1:47:29] consultation maybe two.
[1:47:32] We're going to try to manage it.
[1:47:34] Then he said, "Hey, who put this thing?
[1:47:36] Just take this thing off."
[1:47:39] Yeah. Let the people come. That is how
[1:47:41] much he loved you.
[1:47:46] Now the next morning I phoned him
[1:47:50] pastor how was it yesterday? Oh, he
[1:47:53] said, "Yeah, no. Yesterday we had a good
[1:47:54] time. You know, we were fellowshiping
[1:47:56] with the children of God. You know, we
[1:47:58] were there. You know, there were people
[1:47:59] coming."
[1:48:02] I'm like, "Pastor,
[1:48:04] okay, pastor, what about Oh, no. Don't
[1:48:05] worry about that.
[1:48:08] We are doing the work of the Lord.
[1:48:11] You
[1:48:14] he put you first.
[1:48:17] That is the kind of pastor he was,
[1:48:20] you know.
[1:48:24] Like I say, if you don't do anything
[1:48:25] according to the word,
[1:48:29] he wouldn't take it. I remember there
[1:48:32] was one time also
[1:48:34] now he was worried because for his work,
[1:48:38] his life
[1:48:40] is just the word
[1:48:43] living for Christ. You know, he was the
[1:48:46] epidome of you know there is a song that
[1:48:48] we call rejoice in the Lord.
[1:48:53] He was the [music] prime example of
[1:48:55] that.
[1:48:58] Smile.
[1:49:00] You will know that smile.
[1:49:02] Every time you'll go there, you will
[1:49:05] have a smile.
[1:49:08] He was always happy and happy when he
[1:49:12] was doing the the works of God.
[1:49:16] I don't remember a time when I came and
[1:49:20] he was not at his desk
[1:49:23] reading his books, reading the spoken
[1:49:25] word, reading the Bible, he lived the
[1:49:29] messages he preached.
[1:49:32] Yes, you you could see
[1:49:35] now you know brother says you know I
[1:49:39] believe that we're approaching an hour
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; where missing limb
[1:49:46] missing limbs
[1:49:48] a limp missing limb
[1:49:52] missing limbs will be restored
[1:49:55] his message was that kind of a ministry
[1:49:58] when pastor
[1:50:00] days.
[1:50:02] There was a time when he prayed for a
[1:50:04] lady
[1:50:06] and that lady didn't have hair
[1:50:09] just cut the hair and immediately the
[1:50:11] hair started growing. It is true. I
[1:50:15] witnessed it myself.
[1:50:17] There was one time during
[1:50:20] my mom was sick.
[1:50:22] Now the we I was nursing her. I was in
[1:50:26] ML and she was here in in breast
[1:50:30] and we gave her some medication,
[1:50:32] some treatment.
[1:50:34] She she kept on going down
[1:50:37] and then my sister in the morning one
[1:50:39] day phon me.
[1:50:44] Mom is sick. So we added
[1:50:47] pulse oximter.
[1:50:50] Now we check the saturation level.
[1:50:55] Now saturation level was about 64.
[1:50:59] Now normal
[1:51:02] it must be at least 92 and above.
[1:51:05] Now I was in there I had to drive
[1:51:09] because I needed to take a back for to
[1:51:11] admit.
[1:51:14] You know how the devil works.
[1:51:17] Now while I was supposed to go
[1:51:20] one of my patient had complication.
[1:51:23] Now I had to take it for an operation to
[1:51:25] do a seizure. Now that means my journey
[1:51:28] now which was supposed to be 3 hours
[1:51:32] of four or five hours.
[1:51:35] Now the situation was dropping.
[1:51:39] Now I called my sister and I said call
[1:51:42] the pastor
[1:51:44] and they called the pastor you know
[1:51:47] gently
[1:51:48] over the phone. She prayed for my mom.
[1:51:52] The saturation level went up
[1:51:57] from 64
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; 28 some 88 from 88.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to tell you. It's not a
[1:52:05] joke. It's something that happened. Now
[1:52:08] when I went home there,
[1:52:11] my mom was well
[1:52:13] just I just took her home, you know,
[1:52:15] just aditted her just for precaution.
[1:52:18] But she was healed.
[1:52:20] Now his message
[1:52:24] was that kind of a ministry
[1:52:27] one time I visited him after he came
[1:52:30] from hospital he was in bronos pray
[1:52:34] it was me and
[1:52:38] then we just woriing you know
[1:52:40] fellowshipping
[1:52:43] just this sweet spirit around that house
[1:52:46] you know you know the kind of sweet
[1:52:48] spirit where the holy spirit is there
[1:52:51] now we're worshiping with him there
[1:52:54] now is she then he asked about the
[1:52:56] granddaughter Rego
[1:53:00] then what after asking Rego came in
[1:53:03] now she came in and she said she went to
[1:53:06] the father and said
[1:53:08] can I have a pill you know I've been
[1:53:10] having this terrible headache
[1:53:13] it just doesn't want to stop now because
[1:53:16] that sweet spirit was
[1:53:20] Now I ask
[1:53:23] if you are a Mercedes-Benz
[1:53:25] Mercedes-Benz
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; and you have an engine breakdown,
[1:53:30] where do you go?
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; I know you go to Mercedes-Benz garage.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Now you
[1:53:37] are sick, where should you go?
[1:53:41] He said, I must go to God.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; So where should you go here now?
[1:53:48] Then he went to the grandfather
[1:53:50] the grandfather just touched the head
[1:53:54] immediately
[1:53:56] you know at that time ah you know I was
[1:53:59] a son fellowshipping with the father
[1:54:02] I did not want to be a doctor at that
[1:54:04] time
[1:54:05] I saw the pastor just put hands on it
[1:54:09] and they had a meeting
[1:54:12] stopped
[1:54:14] that is the kind of ministry
[1:54:18] Oh brother. Amen. What a great man.
[1:54:22] Humble man of God
[1:54:24] who loved the people.
[1:54:27] You know everything about him
[1:54:30] was we work based
[1:54:33] and then he rejoice more
[1:54:37] when he was doing the works of God. You
[1:54:40] know after praying for
[1:54:43] you know he was just thinking
[1:54:45] you know he was so happy he was no
[1:54:48] longer a patient and that is how all the
[1:54:51] time we used to meet him
[1:54:54] because when we met him we just
[1:54:57] fellowship talk
[1:54:59] and then that smile
[1:55:01] you know that smile you know contagious
[1:55:04] smile that he had it did not matter
[1:55:07] whether he was in
[1:55:10] He will always have that smile
[1:55:14] joy
[1:55:16] in the Lord
[1:55:18] all the time.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I remember one time you know I
[1:55:24] will say something maybe it might mean a
[1:55:26] bit controversial or something.
[1:55:32] You know one day we went to visit him
[1:55:36] while I was with pastor Kuchingal is
[1:55:38] here
[1:55:43] is there
[1:55:44] then we went into the room
[1:55:47] now he was in bed
[1:55:51] now while lying there he had drips all
[1:55:54] over
[1:55:56] now he he said hey brothers because the
[1:55:59] the the room that he had there was a
[1:56:00] window in front of it
[1:56:04] He said, "You know, you know, I saw the
[1:56:06] new Jerusalem coming.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Now we became quiet.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; You can give the pastor the mic."
[1:56:21] He said that.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:29] Now, after he said that,
[1:56:32] We were quiet.
[1:56:34] You know why we were quiet?
[1:56:37] There was the pastor in bed.
[1:56:40] Drips all over. And he seen the new
[1:56:42] Jerusalem.
[1:56:44] Oh,
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; we say maybe the pastor is going now.
[1:56:48] Now we didn't say anything. We were just
[1:56:50] shocked. Now he turn toan.
[1:56:55] I said, "You see, they don't believe me.
[1:56:58] Maybe you believe me.
[1:57:00] It was not because we don't believe him.
[1:57:03] It is because of the way we we didn't we
[1:57:06] loved him so much. We didn't think it
[1:57:08] was time for him to go. But he stole it.
[1:57:12] Now he was that kind of a person living
[1:57:16] in two worlds.
[1:57:18] That's the kind of person he was.
[1:57:21] And one day I was with Aquilla.
[1:57:25] Oh Aquila, may the good Lord bless you.
[1:57:29] Yes,
[1:57:31] now he phoned me in frustrated
[1:57:35] you know said you know I've been with a
[1:57:38] pastor he doesn't want to take his
[1:57:40] medication
[1:57:42] you know he's just there watching
[1:57:44] documentaries rejoicing
[1:57:47] now I had to teach him you know there's
[1:57:50] a child being
[1:57:53] yeah that's how the pastor is now wait
[1:57:56] for him because he's in another person
[1:57:59] now. Whereby you that person doesn't
[1:58:01] need medication?
[1:58:03] No sir. No. And now if you give
[1:58:05] medication, he's not going to take it.
[1:58:08] Just cool down. Put it next to him. When
[1:58:11] that face passes,
[1:58:14] he will take his medication.
[1:58:16] Yes. They say I'm stop but I have so
[1:58:19] much
[1:58:20] you know. So that is the kind of person
[1:58:23] he was.
[1:58:25] Now in closing I would like to thank all
[1:58:29] the people especially the doctors
[1:58:33] the nurses who looked after him
[1:58:36] from the moment he went first in the
[1:58:38] hospital
[1:58:40] Dr. Ford who was his neurosurgeon
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Dr. Ford
[1:58:43] Dr. Bas
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Dr. For
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; who was the neur neuros neurologist
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; and then also special thanks also to the
[1:58:53] doctors
[1:58:55] in in mystery med clinic.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Dr. Angel his physician drundas
[1:59:03] his cardiologist Dr.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Dr. Tabang his palmonologist
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Dr. Tabang his palologist
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Dr. La his nephologist Dr.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Nephologist
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; and Dr. Mushua Dr. He's a urologist and
[1:59:21] all the people who involved all the
[1:59:23] nurses, the physotherapist,
[1:59:27] occupational health therapist,
[1:59:30] all the nurses,
[1:59:32] you know, when he was in the world,
[1:59:35] it will always be cool.
[1:59:38] All the nurses, you know, he had this
[1:59:40] spirit about him
[1:59:43] wanted to pass there.
[1:59:46] Now, in his final days,
[1:59:48] I remember we the last time I saw him.
[1:59:52] We we went to his house. We were just
[1:59:56] fellowship with him
[1:59:58] with pastor
[2:00:00] with him you know he was just happy but
[2:00:03] he didn't have any appetite
[2:00:06] then
[2:00:08] after they left you know even
[2:00:10] fellowshipping you know singing the song
[2:00:14] he was even fellow
[2:00:16] we have seen the wonders of the gospel
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; that's why I say he was a an example an
[2:00:19] epitome
[2:00:22] of what a jewel being Yes.
[2:00:26] But rejoicing in
[2:00:29] that is the kind of person.
[2:00:31] Now when I saw him
[2:00:35] then I the pastor they left I spoke to
[2:00:37] him
[2:00:39] you know we tried to f him
[2:00:42] you know that is you know you will never
[2:00:44] understand how God works
[2:00:48] because that time when we sent him to
[2:00:49] the hospital the last time
[2:00:52] he was not sick as he was the other time
[2:00:57] it was just precautionary because he was
[2:00:58] just vomiting not having an appetite
[2:01:05] From there I I realized that maybe
[2:01:06] there's something wrong with the
[2:01:07] kidneys. He must be having uric
[2:01:09] gastritis.
[2:01:12] Then we sent him to the hospital.
[2:01:14] No, all the other time ambulances came
[2:01:17] to take him.
[2:01:19] But this time he was walking on his own
[2:01:21] when he went there.
[2:01:25] Not any you know not any pain in his
[2:01:27] body.
[2:01:30] That is how our pastor left
[2:01:32] no pain in his body. You know,
[2:01:36] if you are a child of God when you go,
[2:01:40] you don't struggle.
[2:01:42] You just sleep. Now, our pastor is not
[2:01:45] dead. He's asleep. He has child changed
[2:01:49] dimensions.
[2:01:51] This is just his body.
[2:01:53] You know I was composing at that time
[2:01:57] saying you know Omar
[2:01:59] remember that time in when he has that
[2:02:01] hair around him that black hair that he
[2:02:04] loved.
[2:02:07] If you can just take a picture of 1964
[2:02:09] 1965
[2:02:12] that is how he looks now. No pain in his
[2:02:15] body. No drip that he needs. Rejoice him
[2:02:19] forever. I wonder what they are doing up
[2:02:22] there.
[2:02:26] brother, all of them. Oh, I wonder how
[2:02:30] the reception he got.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wonder. God bless you.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless uh brother
[2:02:47] for all the great labor he has done for
[2:02:52] our pastor.
[2:02:56] I believe there is also a place there
[2:02:58] [snorts] for him.
[2:03:01] Uh before I call
[2:03:04] uh pastor Freddy,
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; I want to call a song item by brother
[2:03:14] uh
[2:03:19] Monty.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Monty Maki,
[2:03:24] he was supposed to sing yesterday
[2:03:28] but due to electricity could not do it.
[2:03:32] So he will come to give us an item
[2:03:38] when we are expecting to hear also a
[2:03:42] short testimony from
[2:03:46] Pastor Freddy
[2:03:48] for the missions of pastor in Africa.

[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; I want to
[2:11:24] invite Pastor Freddy
[2:11:29] You know, Pastor Kadima's ministry and
[2:11:32] life
[2:11:37] was beyond
[2:11:39] the
[2:11:40] borders and the building of Mamelo.
[2:11:47] He went into towns,
[2:11:50] townships,
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; suburbs.
[2:11:55] He had no limitation.
[2:11:59] He did not look at color.
[2:12:02] Did not look at nationality.
[2:12:06] He did not look at age slot
[2:12:10] neither social status,
[2:12:17] public domain property.
[2:12:22] I think in the the early 2000s
[2:12:26] 2000
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; he had covered a lot the Sadc region
[2:12:34] Malawi
[2:12:35] Swazilandana
[2:12:38] Zambia Zimbabwe Zimbabwe you could find
[2:12:41] his footprint all
[2:12:44] then came pastor and pastor Freddy
[2:12:50] and they took him to to the central
[2:12:52] Africa
[2:12:55] in the Congo
[2:12:57] and from there he discovered the other
[2:13:00] parts of Africa
[2:13:03] and Pastor Freddy was behind that
[2:13:09] he brought Cameroon
[2:13:14] he brought uh Togo
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; and all these places that we went
[2:13:23] I remember pastor used to say
[2:13:27] that's why God made him tall
[2:13:32] so that he can see the way
[2:13:35] and we can follow.
[2:13:38] So we wanted him at least to say
[2:13:40] something
[2:13:42] about what has happened that side
[2:13:47] just in five minute. Amen. God bless
[2:13:49] you.
[2:14:04] Shalom.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Shalom church.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; I
[2:14:15] pastor.
[2:14:17] I happened to know pastor at the very
[2:14:20] same time with pastor
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; it was in the days of the dedication of
[2:14:30] amen tabernacle the pastor zakola's
[2:14:33] church
[2:14:37] the manner in which he brought that
[2:14:39] study
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; it kind of touched my heart it vibrated
[2:14:46] in my heart.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; And I say that this is another
[2:14:54] reflection of me.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; And it's ever since we got close
[2:15:02] together.
[2:15:08] When a pastor organized a meeting in the
[2:15:11] Congo,
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; he associated me to that program.
[2:15:19] That's how we got acquainted.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; And I wondered and asked the question to
[2:15:27] myself.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; This ministry was never a local
[2:15:33] ministry.
[2:15:43] And I said to myself that I will cause
[2:15:46] others to benefit of the grace that God
[2:15:48] had planted in this man.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; That's how I happened to be in touch
[2:15:56] with the elders.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; For example, brother
[2:16:04] and the elders
[2:16:10] and we took offer together with pastor.
[2:16:13] We started a trip
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; and I took him to Africa in a Frenchsp
[2:16:19] speaking country.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; He was such a humble man.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; He was not a confusing man, a
[2:16:28] complicated man in his life.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; And he released life.
[2:16:36] He was a kind of man who lived
[2:16:38] everything that went out of his mouth.
[2:16:43] He had a big heart
[2:16:46] and uh avoid repeating myself
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; or repeat what other side
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; because everything that was said behind
[2:16:57] the pulpit is the truth.
[2:17:01] When he came in the Congo,
[2:17:05] I had nothing on me.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; I had nothing on me.
[2:17:10] I was uh still a tenant.
[2:17:14] I was hiring a little renting small
[2:17:16] house
[2:17:18] and I loed some few sisters in my house.
[2:17:23] But after his passing in my church
[2:17:27] and he simply broached the word.
[2:17:33] He never spoke of things such as a
[2:17:36] prosperity.
[2:17:40] He simply preached that which he was
[2:17:42] used to preach.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; As he came back here in South Africa,
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; we noticed we noticed the prosperity
[2:17:54] getting into our church.
[2:18:00] He is such a man who blessed many men or
[2:18:03] servants of God.
[2:18:07] It shared grace with the men of God,
[2:18:10] servants of God.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; Like my elder said
[2:18:17] that last night,
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; he said he asked a question to now
[2:18:25] that I I need to meet this guy.
[2:18:30] The very same question I asked myself
[2:18:34] and I asked him a question, what shall I
[2:18:37] do in order to meet God?
[2:18:42] He told me that the simply observe the
[2:18:45] way things are moving on.
[2:18:48] As we walked together,
[2:18:52] as we walk together, there must be
[2:18:54] transmission of God.
[2:18:57] And that word really touched me and had
[2:19:00] an impact on me.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; And I could see that everywhere he was
[2:19:04] welcomed by my friends
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; whether it be in Brazville,
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Cameroon,
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Libraville,
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; Libraville, Ben,
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Benin, Togo.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; He was a such a blessing.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; So we're not going to forget him. Don't
[2:19:24] forget him swiftly.
[2:19:27] Keep in mind that God had given you a
[2:19:29] great gift.
[2:19:32] So stay with the teachings that he gave
[2:19:33] you
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; and stay together
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; and that God will look after the the
[2:19:41] rest.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless bless Pastor Freddy.
[2:19:52] uh we have been in many meetings
[2:19:54] together with the pastor and him in
[2:19:57] Africa.
[2:20:02] The pastor was really a blessing.
[2:20:05] Yes, we have many much to say
[2:20:09] but time will fail us
[2:20:13] like the Bible says when Paul was
[2:20:15] speaking
[2:20:18] time will fail me.
[2:20:21] If I must speak about these warriors of
[2:20:23] faith,
[2:20:26] it won't be enough time to speak about
[2:20:29] the life of pastor.
[2:20:35] Let's get to uh we want to have a
[2:20:38] tribute.
[2:20:40] But before that, I don't know if Pastor
[2:20:44] Maka is ready
[2:20:47] to speak on behalf of the local pastors.
[2:20:52] We would like to have him say something.
[2:20:58] He has done so much
[2:21:01] by the side of Pastor Israel.
[2:21:07] God bless you, pastor. Amen.
[2:21:13] Thank you,
[2:21:15] Master of Ceremonies.
[2:21:19] Protocols observed,
[2:21:24] I greet you all.
[2:21:29] [applause]
[2:21:35] As they have written here, as they have
[2:21:38] written here,
[2:21:40] the local pastor.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; I don't have a speech.
[2:21:47] But what I have
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; is we
[2:21:53] the family,
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; the church,
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; the board
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; of Assemble
[2:22:03] and it sister churches.
[2:22:09] We are deeply humbled
[2:22:13] by your presence.
[2:22:16] and your words [applause]
[2:22:22] and your words of comfort
[2:22:26] therefore of have comforted us
[2:22:30] and if this thing
[2:22:34] emerge on the way
[2:22:37] I think your presence
[2:22:40] and your word of comfort
[2:22:43] will also emerge.
[2:22:46] And when they emerge,
[2:22:48] they will comfort us. God bless you. God
[2:22:52] bless you. Thank you so much. [applause]
[2:22:56] God bless you, Pastor Ma. Thank you so
[2:22:58] much.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Um, I want maybe have
[2:23:06] an item from the final voice, Captain
[2:23:09] Park.
[2:23:13] They will come
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; final voice
[2:23:22] uh bishop will get ready.
[2:23:27] So after the item
[2:23:30] then he will come to uh give as he was
[2:23:35] requested a tribute
[2:23:39] for the life of our precious pastor
[2:23:42] Kodima
[2:23:46] some music and play in the meantime just
[2:23:49] to relax our minds
[2:23:53] in the presence of the Lord. How many
[2:23:55] are happy here to celebrate?
[2:23:59] We are celebrating a life well lived.
[2:24:05] Amen. Maybe we can have one song while
[2:24:07] they are coming.

[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; I believe we sang this song with Pastor
[2:31:32] at our homes and
[2:31:36] I I believe today it's a reality for
[2:31:40] him.
[2:31:42] We praise the Lord for a welllived life.
[2:31:49] Pastoring can come
[2:31:53] tribute.
[2:31:55] Brother interpreter, can you please
[2:31:58] come?
[2:32:02] still have two or three items
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; before we get to the closing of our
[2:32:12] service.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; How many love the Lord more tonight,
[2:32:24] this afternoon, this morning? Please, we
[2:32:28] love the Lord more than ever before.
[2:32:31] Thank you.
[2:32:35] Good microphone.
[2:32:45] It's with the pain in our hearts that we
[2:32:47] express ourselves here.
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; When we learned of the departure of
[2:32:57] pastor Israel Kodima
[2:33:02] Uh we were so touched affected
[2:33:11] but uh it is our great joy to know such
[2:33:14] a lost he
[2:33:17] is not lost but he is resting.
[2:33:24] avoid what others side to say what
[2:33:27] others said.
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; Pastor
[2:33:34] to us he has been
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; he has been a step leader.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; Thus was such a great ministry.
[2:33:47] when a pastor Freddy
[2:33:52] spoke to us about pastor.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; It was during a great uh convention. Uh
[2:34:05] it was in 2015 or 2014 somewhere there.
[2:34:11] Uh we we took a flight all the way to to
[2:34:14] South Africa.
[2:34:19] And I would like to say that should I
[2:34:21] claim to have known South Africa today
[2:34:26] it is through or thanks to pastor Kodima
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; and if we today know each other you and
[2:34:33] I
[2:34:34] through pastor
[2:34:40] the first time that I had a chance of
[2:34:42] listening to him.
[2:34:46] Listening to him left me with such an
[2:34:49] impact in my life
[2:34:54] and we did the utmost to have him in
[2:34:58] libriv
[2:35:11] that had a chance of traveling to
[2:35:13] Libraville.
[2:35:15] Pastor Freddy,
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; for example, Pastor Freddy
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; in Libraville, we had a small building,
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; but after his passing, his visit,
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; his first trip to Librivville
[2:35:36] as I'm talking to you today,
[2:35:39] should we count in Gabon the biggest
[2:35:42] temples? Should we count two of them?
[2:35:47] We are amongst the biggest temple in
[2:35:50] Kabon.
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; Thanks to the blessing,
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; thanks to the blessing of the ministry
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; of pastor Israel.
[2:36:03] I have much appreciated this ministry.
[2:36:10] Last year we happened to visit to be
[2:36:12] here.
[2:36:16] We happened to visit him while he was
[2:36:18] sick
[2:36:21] and we happened to uh speak with the
[2:36:24] entire family that is which is here
[2:36:27] today.
[2:36:30] Please bear with me uh for what I'm
[2:36:32] about to say for the next two three
[2:36:34] minutes.
[2:36:38] Uh to me as we spoke last year, it was
[2:36:40] like a farewell
[2:36:43] [music]
[2:36:44] because the manner of our communication
[2:36:48] and the way or the manner in which he
[2:36:50] responded,
[2:36:53] it was the same month, November last
[2:36:55] year,
[2:36:57] almost the same date.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; I spoke to him.
[2:37:04] I spoke to him about his ministry
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; because a ministry does not go off does
[2:37:14] not go out.
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; Even Paul of old. Paul could say to
[2:37:19] Timothy
[2:37:21] that Timothy my son that which is in you
[2:37:25] was in your great grand
[2:37:31] as we we it must be that as we see
[2:37:33] William Brham
[2:37:36] uh the ministry from William Brham onto
[2:37:38] Joseph
[2:37:41] and I can tell you today
[2:37:45] I can tell you to be honest my father
[2:37:47] was a pastor
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; and his ministry fell on came on me
[2:37:53] and it continues even on my children.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; I have a son who's a great preacher
[2:38:02] and he had passed through here
[2:38:08] and I prayed to the Lord.
[2:38:13] I my prayer to the Lord is that the gift
[2:38:15] that was in pastor Israel
[2:38:19] let the same continue within the family
[2:38:24] the master continue within the family
[2:38:26] his family
[2:38:28] a ministry is not barren
[2:38:33] it might fall or come on one of his sons
[2:38:39] according to God God's own description
[2:38:44] And I say this to the church.
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; May we stay united
[2:38:56] because we've seen things whereby a
[2:38:59] pastor passes on.
[2:39:04] But even before the pastor gets buried,
[2:39:08] we could we've seen things such as a
[2:39:11] fight of who will take over.
[2:39:15] Uh this one this one says I would take
[2:39:17] over.
[2:39:19] Another one over there got his own
[2:39:20] ambitions.
[2:39:22] No.
[2:39:25] The Holy Spirit
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; that led, the very same Holy Spirit that
[2:39:30] led Pastor Kodima.
[2:39:33] &gt;&gt; May the same Holy Spirit leads Melody
[2:39:35] Tabernacle,
[2:39:36] &gt;&gt; but the politic,
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; no politics,
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; but the group,
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; no,
[2:39:42] separated group [music]
[2:39:45] with intentions,
[2:39:49] &gt;&gt; let me emphasize on this. It takes the
[2:39:51] Holy Spirit. It takes the Holy Spirit
[2:39:54] himself
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; to lead me.
[2:39:58] &gt;&gt; We don't want a politics.
[2:40:03] &gt;&gt; I landed yesterday at 11 p.m.
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; Uh because we got delayed.
[2:40:11] We came straight over here.
[2:40:15] And after we here,
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; but I say this to the church,
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; do not to you the church, you do not
[2:40:24] forsake this congregation.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, do not abandon the
[2:40:30] church.
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; Never abandon the family.
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; Never abandon pastor's family.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; Never forsake the pastor's family.
[2:40:43] If you are ever been a blessed
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; through the ministry of this man
[2:40:51] than this man
[2:40:55] God has given him his first church
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; which is a family and after you.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; So all together we building up one block
[2:41:07] one church.
[2:41:09] You should never forsake this family.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; Honor this family.
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[2:41:19] we as Africans,
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; we as a black
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; after the departure of the pastor,
[2:41:28] the widow goes through hardship with the
[2:41:31] children.
[2:41:33] Let it not be the case.
[2:41:41] The family of the departed pastor should
[2:41:44] never go through suffering.
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; Is the family of our prophet suffering
[2:41:50] today?
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; Did she suffer after
[2:41:58] the children all the way to the
[2:42:00] grandchildren? Are they suffering?
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; We happened we had a chance of visiting
[2:42:05] them.
[2:42:09] You should see the church today. They
[2:42:11] are supporting that family.
[2:42:14] This is a testimony that I'm giving out.
[2:42:17] So the pastor's family should never go
[2:42:19] through suffering.
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; His wife should never suffer.
[2:42:24] His children should never suffer.
[2:42:27] The church should all be around them to
[2:42:29] guide him. Who knows?
[2:42:32] Who knows?
[2:42:35] &gt;&gt; If a God could be so kind as to raise up
[2:42:37] one of his sons to take her over.
[2:42:42] If we claim to love Pastor Israel
[2:42:46] and if we claim to have respect in his
[2:42:48] ministry.
[2:42:50] I fear not to say it.
[2:42:53] I'm not afraid of saying this, but I say
[2:42:55] what I believe to be the truth. If we
[2:42:58] claim to love,
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; if we loved him, [music]
[2:43:02] and that we love his family.
[2:43:05] May we pray for the Lord to continue
[2:43:08] for now. [music]
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; Let me stop here.
[2:43:14] My
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; my condolences to the entire family
[2:43:19] and to the entire church of Mali
[2:43:22] Tabernacle.
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; God bless you, pastor.
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:28] Amen. May God bless our pastors.
[2:43:31] These pastors have
[2:43:35] these pastors they have really honored
[2:43:37] the life of pastor Israel
[2:43:43] and we are so thankful unto them.
[2:43:46] Uh I think I have one more item here.
[2:43:53] Um
[2:43:55] we want to give uh now the space for the
[2:43:58] grandchildren.
[2:44:01] Uh we know how much pastor was attached
[2:44:04] to them.
[2:44:08] We can start by hearing from them a
[2:44:11] musical item
[2:44:15] and then they will have we will have a
[2:44:18] speech by children and grandchildren.
[2:44:24] Amen.

[2:52:14] [music]
[2:52:16] I'm so
[2:52:26] [music]
[2:52:33] I greet you all in the wonderful name of
[2:52:36] my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[2:52:41] My name is
[2:52:47] Mulu used to call me Bobo. My
[2:52:50] grandfather used to call me Bobo
[2:52:52] &gt;&gt; and I think he believed that's my real
[2:52:55] name because he never knew that I'm
[2:52:57] leveling
[2:53:03] losing has been the most difficult
[2:53:11] and surreal experience of our lives.
[2:53:18] We know and believe
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; that he's alive
[2:53:25] and we mourn knowing that we will see
[2:53:27] him again.
[2:53:31] But parting with him in this dimension
[2:53:34] is
[2:53:38] it's just too painful.
[2:53:42] We have been privileged
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; and favored by God
[2:53:49] &gt;&gt; to be blessed with such a phenomenal
[2:53:52] grandfather.
[2:53:57] &gt;&gt; While serving the bride globally
[2:54:03] ensured that our childhood [music] and
[2:54:05] upbringing was one for the books.
[2:54:14] He made it a very memorable one.
[2:54:20] &gt;&gt; We lived about five, it was a 5 minutes
[2:54:23] drive from school to home.
[2:54:29] And normally we'd walk home,
[2:54:34] but there were times when he'd say to
[2:54:35] us, "That you
[2:54:40] and knowu he takes his own sweet time
[2:54:46] and he'd get there after school when
[2:54:48] nearly all the children have left.
[2:54:54] But he was going to take us on a drive.
[2:55:00] We always knew that when he came was
[2:55:01] going to take us to Roslin and get his
[2:55:04] mail.
[2:55:08] And then we'd get takeaways.
[2:55:12] &gt;&gt; But on the drive, don't you dare sleep
[2:55:18] because you're going to get the pinching
[2:55:20] of your life.
[2:55:24] He was convinced that Mercedes-Benz is
[2:55:26] the best car manufacturer in the world.
[2:55:33] You were not going to win that fight.
[2:55:38] And while he's driving, it's like he's
[2:55:40] eyeing all these BMW and
[2:55:47] if one of those drivers just look at
[2:55:48] him,
[2:55:51] he'd think they're provoking him to a
[2:55:53] race.
[2:55:56] Andu would be all in spirit and he'd be
[2:55:59] racing to
[2:56:04] &gt;&gt; and he'd always win.
[2:56:08] Um
[2:56:12] taught us excellence.
[2:56:15] Excellence. Muli taught us excellence.
[2:56:20] &gt;&gt; Excellence.
[2:56:24] If he gives you a task,
[2:56:26] It's either you were going to do it
[2:56:28] right or just don't do it at all.
[2:56:34] We knew that when we
[2:56:36] when we clean
[2:56:40] was coming,
[2:56:43] he would always say to us, "If I come
[2:56:46] and check these books
[2:56:49] and I find them skew,
[2:56:52] then that means your brain is skew.
[2:56:56] So he always taught us that the product
[2:56:59] of your work
[2:57:03] &gt;&gt; is a reflection of your brain
[2:57:08] and this is something we've carried on
[2:57:10] even in our work ethic at work.
[2:57:16] He taught us spiritual warfare.
[2:57:21] Mukulu had so many different people
[2:57:25] coming at home with so many different
[2:57:27] spiritual issues.
[2:57:33] But he was not scared to say, "You're
[2:57:36] going to sleep with this person in the
[2:57:39] guest house."
[2:57:44] Mind you, the guest house is isolated
[2:57:47] from God
[2:57:51] and we just witnessed we just witnessed
[2:57:53] this person being possessed. Now,
[2:57:57] &gt;&gt; now we are told
[2:58:03] but it was a way of him showing us that
[2:58:06] what is in him is also in us.
[2:58:14] I was a very timid person.
[2:58:18] He taught me to walk in the dark.
[2:58:22] &gt;&gt; He wasn't aware,
[2:58:24] &gt;&gt; but I would always wait on the visitors
[2:58:27] cuz we always had visitors almost every
[2:58:28] day at home.
[2:58:32] So, I just waited up so that he doesn't
[2:58:34] have to come from down from upstairs and
[2:58:37] lock the the gates and open up for the
[2:58:39] dogs.
[2:58:42] So every time the visitors would leave,
[2:58:45] I would go lock the gate
[2:58:49] &gt;&gt; and I would have that excruciating walk
[2:58:51] to go and open up for the dog in the
[2:58:54] dark.
[2:59:01] But would always be just standing
[2:59:03] upstairs there by the gate
[2:59:07] and I'd walk go and open up for the
[2:59:09] door.
[2:59:11] and come back and it just wake me good
[2:59:13] night go.
[2:59:16] That's how I learned to walk in the
[2:59:18] dark.
[2:59:20] He paid attention to detail.
[2:59:24] Appearance was very important to him.
[2:59:29] So when you would see him walking on the
[2:59:31] pullpit looking all smart,
[2:59:37] we had a pageant back at home.
[2:59:41] He would parade and model for us.
[2:59:46] And he'd want our view.
[2:59:49] So if the outfit was very nice, we are
[2:59:52] very careful not to give him too many
[2:59:54] compliments.
[2:59:59] If you give him too many compliments,
[3:00:00] he's not going to wear it.
[3:00:06] um
[3:00:08] he'd buy us like big packs of snacks
[3:00:10] [music]
[3:00:16] &gt;&gt; and even when he's busy,
[3:00:19] &gt;&gt; he would pack little packets for us to
[3:00:21] take for lunch.
[3:00:27] Uh
[3:00:27] &gt;&gt; I remember when I I was pregnant with
[3:00:30] our first baby
[3:00:35] Um, my face was so bad. I had pimples
[3:00:38] all over
[3:00:41] and it didn't bother me that much. I
[3:00:43] didn't talk to him about it.
[3:00:47] &gt;&gt; But when I got to him, just looked at me
[3:00:50] and he held my hand and he's like, "Your
[3:00:53] face is going to be fine."
[3:00:56] Miraculously, I didn't even go to a
[3:00:58] dermatologist.
[3:01:01] My face just started clearing up.
[3:01:06] He he took time to learn his
[3:01:09] grandchildren,
[3:01:13] our characters, our different
[3:01:14] personalities.
[3:01:17] And if you're not okay,
[3:01:19] he would be the first to detect it.
[3:01:22] He would approach you and be like,
[3:01:25] "What's wrong? What's bothering? Talk to
[3:01:28] me."
[3:01:29] He was so caring.
[3:01:32] Whenever there was an announcement for
[3:01:34] an outreach in the service
[3:01:41] &gt;&gt; and the children of God are rejoicing
[3:01:42] and we are all happy he's going to
[3:01:44] spread the gospel.
[3:01:49] We were the happiest of all the
[3:01:50] congregants.
[3:01:54] Yes, we love that he was spreading the
[3:01:55] gospel,
[3:01:59] but we knew that every outreach meant we
[3:02:02] get money.
[3:02:06] So every time would go let's say to
[3:02:08] Congo
[3:02:11] he would take his time to sit down
[3:02:15] take different envelopes
[3:02:17] write our names put in different amounts
[3:02:20] in those envelopes and when he's about
[3:02:23] to go board his flight
[3:02:26] we'd stand in a queue and he would dish
[3:02:29] them out to us. That's why we were happy
[3:02:32] for out.
[3:02:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, he was very funny.
[3:02:38] &gt;&gt; Um, when you see his grandchildren being
[3:02:40] slender,
[3:02:46] it's it's not a physical matter.
[3:02:52] It's spiritual.
[3:02:54] He would jokingly say to us,
[3:02:58] &gt;&gt; "The reason for my weight loss,
[3:03:02] &gt;&gt; it's because the scriptures say,
[3:03:04] "Narrow is the way.
[3:03:07] Straight is the gate." Amen. And oh,
[3:03:10] straight is the gate.
[3:03:13] And if you want to go in the rapture,
[3:03:16] you don't want to be squeezing in.
[3:03:22] So that's why we we have no choice.
[3:03:25] We must be sli
[3:03:32] so much fun with us.
[3:03:36] And um Mukulu had this game he called.
[3:03:43] &gt;&gt; So he would have us have us like pack
[3:03:46] like do a tower of our hands.
[3:03:51] But he was always taking advantage of us
[3:03:53] cuz we were young.
[3:03:57] So he would always have us put our hands
[3:03:59] first
[3:04:02] so that he could pinch us harder.
[3:04:06] And we've always been trying to avenge
[3:04:07] ourselves to find a game,
[3:04:11] but we haven't done
[3:04:14] always win.
[3:04:16] He would do bicep lifts with us,
[3:04:22] run with us.
[3:04:24] Coming back from running his errands, he
[3:04:26] would come park his car, play the music
[3:04:29] loud, and call you to come and dance
[3:04:31] with me.
[3:04:35] He was such a good listener.
[3:04:39] If you ask him money, you don't ask
[3:04:42] twice. Sometimes he'd be busy with
[3:04:44] visitors the whole day
[3:04:48] and then whoever asked him for money
[3:04:50] could fall asleep.
[3:04:53] Mulu wouldn't forget.
[3:04:55] He would take that money, put it under
[3:04:58] the mat at his door
[3:05:00] knowing that when he wake up in the
[3:05:02] morning,
[3:05:03] he'd be asleep,
[3:05:05] but you'd still find what you asked for.
[3:05:10] &gt;&gt; He was nurturing.
[3:05:12] Nurturing. He was nurturing.
[3:05:18] He even when he was preparing for
[3:05:20] sermons,
[3:05:23] he would take the time to cook for the
[3:05:25] family.
[3:05:29] While he's cooking the spiritual food,
[3:05:31] we also get
[3:05:35] he encouraged us to work out our
[3:05:37] salvation,
[3:05:42] not to depend on him or
[3:05:46] have him as a crush to heaven.
[3:05:52] And we always knew that if we aligned
[3:05:54] our lives with the word of God,
[3:05:58] We'd never disappoint him.
[3:06:02] Had a great influence on our lives.
[3:06:06] We were never rebellious teenagers.
[3:06:12] We don't know what adolescent is.
[3:06:17] I believe he prayed over our lives.
[3:06:21] That's why we are who we are today.
[3:06:26] We never had any fallout with
[3:06:33] but when it came to Zand's music,
[3:06:39] he'd always be upset with us
[3:06:43] because we we didn't like that music
[3:06:46] and he loved the music.
[3:06:49] You'd find us laughing at the songs.
[3:06:55] falling asleep
[3:06:57] and he would take offense.
[3:07:00] He would tell you it's either you get
[3:07:02] out and go downstairs
[3:07:06] or you sit here and drink.
[3:07:10] That is the only fall art we used to
[3:07:11] have at Mun.
[3:07:14] He took in other children from different
[3:07:16] families.
[3:07:19] He treated them like his own.
[3:07:22] He never segregated anyone.
[3:07:26] He never discriminated anyone.
[3:07:30] He wanted each and every one of those
[3:07:32] children to experience how it is to live
[3:07:35] with a godly character.
[3:07:41] Mul's end goal was all of these children
[3:07:44] to accept the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:07:51] and he wanted to live it
[3:07:55] and he wanted us as well to live it.
[3:07:59] He was so proud of us.
[3:08:03] He loved us. He loved his great
[3:08:05] grandchildren so much.
[3:08:08] We shared a lot of milestones with
[3:08:14] even little things like gossip from
[3:08:17] school.
[3:08:21] He was so interested to know what's
[3:08:23] going on at school.
[3:08:26] Who's doing what? And we'd always sit
[3:08:28] and tell him all's
[3:08:34] love language was doing acts of service.
[3:08:41] All our lives, every day, Mukulu would
[3:08:43] show us that he loves us.
[3:08:47] And in the last call that we had with
[3:08:50] him,
[3:08:54] he said to us,
[3:08:57] "I love you guys." That was the first
[3:09:00] and the last time we've ever heard utter
[3:09:03] those words. We knew he
[3:09:07] but that day we were so happy together.
[3:09:14] I consider him as a gentle giant.
[3:09:19] He was well known globally but very
[3:09:21] humble.
[3:09:25] If he walks into a room, his presence is
[3:09:27] felt.
[3:09:30] He doesn't even need to say much.
[3:09:34] And as much as he dedicated most of his
[3:09:36] time to the bride of Christ,
[3:09:42] he never neglected his grandfatherly
[3:09:44] duties.
[3:09:46] He never neglected his grandfatherly
[3:09:48] duties.
[3:09:54] He taught us to lay our treasures in
[3:09:56] heavenly places
[3:10:00] and left us with an eternal inheritance
[3:10:06] by living his entire life for Christ.
[3:10:10] He may be out of sight right now,
[3:10:14] but his passing has encouraged us to
[3:10:16] deepen our roots in the word of God.
[3:10:23] that we can be able to meet him again.
[3:10:27] Amen. Amen.
[3:10:41] [clears throat]
[3:10:41] &gt;&gt; Shalom saints.
[3:10:42] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[3:10:42] &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the name of our Lord,
[3:10:45] Savior, and eternal King Jesus Christ.
[3:10:51] You know, I have a lot to say about the
[3:10:53] pastor,
[3:10:55] but I'll be brief. [snorts]
[3:10:59] &gt;&gt; When I started being in front of the
[3:11:01] pastor, [clears throat]
[3:11:04] I was attending.
[3:11:07] So, I love my pastor so much.
[3:11:12] Almost my entire
[3:11:20] So
[3:11:23] before he was my pastor, he let us go
[3:11:25] and visit the anchor.
[3:11:30] And I was surprised in that room there
[3:11:33] was a certain photo.
[3:11:35] Then I asked the pastor,
[3:11:38] "Uncle, whose child is this one? Because
[3:11:39] I don't know her."
[3:11:42] said
[3:11:45] &gt;&gt; the mother came here because she
[3:11:47] couldn't bear children.
[3:11:51] &gt;&gt; I prayed for the mother and this one is
[3:11:52] the firstborn
[3:11:57] in my heart.
[3:11:59] I said there it goes.
[3:12:02] I didn't believe
[3:12:08] &gt;&gt; I then started traveling with him
[3:12:10] together with
[3:12:15] all this old man
[3:12:16] &gt;&gt; I was asking myself one thing
[3:12:21] they 2 a.m.
[3:12:27] One day I was with him in the kind I
[3:12:28] said uncle tell me
[3:12:31] these old men don't they have their own
[3:12:33] families.
[3:12:35] He said no you don't understand their
[3:12:37] pastor
[3:12:38] and then I adise them here and there
[3:12:43] not knowing
[3:12:46] even I myself
[3:12:49] I'm going to cry unto him having my
[3:12:51] challenges and then he guided me
[3:12:54] &gt;&gt; and led me to the Christ.
[3:13:00] while I'm traveling with him together
[3:13:01] with elders and
[3:13:04] while he praying for the people then I
[3:13:06] learned and discovered something
[3:13:11] that the gift of healing
[3:13:15] is not where I was attending church
[3:13:16] before
[3:13:18] it's present in this man
[3:13:21] &gt;&gt; then I got baptized
[3:13:24] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:13:27] from there
[3:13:34] while he was praying for the people.
[3:13:37] It didn't matter.
[3:13:41] He always had that faith the Lord will
[3:13:44] make this people
[3:13:51] to an extent.
[3:13:55] tell me not knowing whether to address
[3:13:57] him as my uncle or the pastor. So I
[3:13:59] remember
[3:14:01] when the apostles the disciples then
[3:14:04] &gt;&gt; I remember typing
[3:14:09] a storm
[3:14:12] &gt;&gt; about the disciples when they
[3:14:14] experienced the storm
[3:14:15] &gt;&gt; and then when they called to him they
[3:14:16] say master
[3:14:21] &gt;&gt; then one day in that upper room
[3:14:24] &gt;&gt; the other day I went in the upper room
[3:14:27] That man
[3:14:29] always
[3:14:30] &gt;&gt; I met the pastor with his smile shalom.
[3:14:33] &gt;&gt; And then shalom master.
[3:14:35] &gt;&gt; How are you sir?
[3:14:38] &gt;&gt; My brother all is well.
[3:14:42] That time he had slept 5:00 a.m.
[3:14:44] &gt;&gt; attending to the ship of God.
[3:14:48] So I thank God
[3:14:52] for letting me see beyond
[3:14:59] letting me see beyond him as just a
[3:15:01] relative
[3:15:05] but as a servant and loyal servant of
[3:15:07] the Almighty God.
[3:15:10] And then
[3:15:13] we are all witnesses
[3:15:17] and then a Bible at the same time. In
[3:15:19] closing,
[3:15:23] brother a Christian is a God dwelling.
[3:15:30] the Holy Spirit
[3:15:32] and then
[3:15:34] the Holy Spirit in our hearts
[3:15:38] there is a Holy Spirit who will also
[3:15:40] love one another and then through that
[3:15:42] love
[3:15:45] it behooves us
[3:15:47] all things that we do
[3:15:52] testify
[3:15:54] no rather our actions will
[3:15:57] H testify to everyone else in the world
[3:16:02] that we had a pastor sent from God.
[3:16:07] God bless you.
[3:16:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you.
[3:16:13] Shalom.
[3:16:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:16:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:16:17] &gt;&gt; Shalom church.
[3:16:18] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[3:16:19] &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the name of the Lord
[3:16:21] Jesus Christ.
[3:16:34] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:16:35] &gt;&gt; All the elders in the name of Jesus
[3:16:37] Christ.
[3:16:40] All our sister churches in the name of
[3:16:42] Jesus Christ.
[3:16:48] In the name of Jesus Christ,
[3:16:51] God is still God.
[3:16:54] My name is Sheron Rosen.
[3:16:58] I'm [clears throat] the firstborn
[3:17:01] pastor is
[3:17:04] I don't have a speech
[3:17:07] because I can say a lot. I can talk for
[3:17:11] the whole day and
[3:17:14] about my father.
[3:17:17] He was my father in the natural
[3:17:22] &gt;&gt; and also in the spiritual.
[3:17:25] &gt;&gt; But
[3:17:29] I found myself to be leaning too much in
[3:17:32] the spiritual side.
[3:17:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because
[3:17:38] my father
[3:17:41] &gt;&gt; when I started staying with him in 2019
[3:17:45] &gt;&gt; most of the time upper room
[3:17:53] you will say the things I'm telling you
[3:17:56] the perfect
[3:17:57] &gt;&gt; I tell them to the perfect
[3:18:00] &gt;&gt; so
[3:18:02] the pastor has taught me I don't have
[3:18:07] every time
[3:18:12] the child is sick.
[3:18:20] He told me, Sharon, you must arrive to
[3:18:23] the state where I am
[3:18:28] and have what I have. And then
[3:18:33] and he told me about the quotes
[3:18:36] that if he's a sick person,
[3:18:39] &gt;&gt; here is a quote.
[3:18:41] &gt;&gt; When the child is sick,
[3:18:44] &gt;&gt; pray for the child and she'll be healed.
[3:18:47] &gt;&gt; My father gave me
[3:18:50] he gave me a military a spiritual
[3:18:52] military.
[3:18:54] What I like to tell the people that is a
[3:18:56] training military training
[3:19:00] &gt;&gt; even if he has departed
[3:19:05] because on Monday
[3:19:12] when he was talking to me telling me a
[3:19:14] lot
[3:19:18] he didn't tell me much but he told me he
[3:19:20] was streaming and he saw me at church.
[3:19:23] go OSM under blessing for me. Go OSM
[3:19:28] under pastor blessing.
[3:19:31] He said to me, Sharon, you must just
[3:19:34] hold on
[3:19:34] &gt;&gt; because
[3:19:37] he's coming back
[3:19:38] &gt;&gt; now. I believe in my father
[3:19:42] beyond the time
[3:19:48] and there's no one
[3:19:52] we have seen his life.
[3:19:55] My father has lived for God the whole of
[3:19:58] his life. And the prophet
[3:20:01] &gt;&gt; prophet says
[3:20:03] &gt;&gt; beyond the of time
[3:20:06] &gt;&gt; you enter beyond the curtain of time
[3:20:08] &gt;&gt; perfect love.
[3:20:13] &gt;&gt; So it means my father
[3:20:18] he had love
[3:20:20] he saw God.
[3:20:24] We also saints you must have love.
[3:20:29] so that we can meet our pastor again.
[3:20:34] We as his children, we must have love
[3:20:39] because if we don't have love, we'll
[3:20:41] never see our father again.
[3:20:45] And the church, the same applies.
[3:20:49] Let us love one another, saints.
[3:20:54] The Bible says, if you don't have love,
[3:20:56] you don't have God.
[3:21:00] Amen.
[3:21:01] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[3:21:04] [music]
[3:21:15] Greetings to everyone in the name of our
[3:21:17] Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:21:20] I also wanted to write something
[3:21:24] but I didn't know what to write.
[3:21:28] The other day I stood at the tabernacle.
[3:21:33] I'm giving thanks to God
[3:21:37] for healing the pastor, our father.
[3:21:42] But he healed him physically.
[3:21:48] Today I'm standing again
[3:21:51] to thank the Lord again
[3:21:54] for healing him
[3:21:56] completely.
[3:22:03] Uh what comforts me
[3:22:06] is that he taught us
[3:22:09] that you get you can get sick
[3:22:12] &gt;&gt; and then you get healed
[3:22:14] &gt;&gt; and live longer
[3:22:16] &gt;&gt; or you get sick
[3:22:18] and God heals you completely.
[3:22:22] So I'm glad that
[3:22:25] this soldier
[3:22:27] he fought a good fight
[3:22:30] and those who know him
[3:22:34] um God first
[3:22:41] &gt;&gt; stated last night
[3:22:43] that he drove alone all the way from in
[3:22:46] the northwest
[3:22:50] &gt;&gt; to Malawi. I am allowed
[3:22:52] &gt;&gt; just to preach.
[3:22:54] &gt;&gt; And that time at that moment
[3:22:57] our mother
[3:23:00] was supposed to go for a medical
[3:23:02] procedure
[3:23:06] but then he continued to pack his bags
[3:23:10] and said God first
[3:23:13] and he said I'm going to serve God.
[3:23:17] While serving God he will heal your
[3:23:20] mother.
[3:23:22] And it happened exactly like that.
[3:23:26] And um fast forward to to the Monday
[3:23:29] before his passing.
[3:23:34] I also visited him with um Reu, my
[3:23:38] daughter
[3:23:40] with my daughter. So we arrived very
[3:23:42] early around 9:00
[3:23:44] a.m. He called to to his bedroom.
[3:23:50] So I found him with with
[3:23:54] um when arrived he called her.
[3:23:58] &gt;&gt; He was very happy.
[3:24:01] &gt;&gt; He was um extremely handsome.
[3:24:05] &gt;&gt; I know he's handsome.
[3:24:08] But that day
[3:24:10] and so he stayed with in the bedroom for
[3:24:13] the whole day.
[3:24:16] I remember walking to the bedroom
[3:24:20] And I asked him, "What are you doing?"
[3:24:23] &gt;&gt; He said to me, "I'm looking at the
[3:24:25] city."
[3:24:28] &gt;&gt; And so the the screen was on.
[3:24:32] &gt;&gt; So I thought he was looking at the city
[3:24:34] on the screen.
[3:24:38] But after his passing,
[3:24:41] I realized that no, he was not looking
[3:24:43] at the screen.
[3:24:46] And that same day,
[3:24:49] Um so um before the Monday
[3:24:53] &gt;&gt; he's been telling us that um he's
[3:24:55] organizing a big conference
[3:24:59] conference and it's a reathering that's
[3:25:03] the
[3:25:04] all the pastors will be there
[3:25:07] in December and he was telling me you
[3:25:09] need to prepare for the pastors
[3:25:13] make sure there's enough food for
[3:25:15] everyone.
[3:25:16] especially
[3:25:18] the pastors.
[3:25:20] I didn't know that he was talking about
[3:25:21] this.
[3:25:23] &gt;&gt; And I believe this is the conference he
[3:25:25] was talking about.
[3:25:33] And that Monday, I'm going to be short
[3:25:35] pastor that
[3:25:38] so um he he didn't want to eat.
[3:25:43] I tried to give him food.
[3:25:45] I tried to give him water
[3:25:48] and he said, "Oh,
[3:25:51] &gt;&gt; I don't want food.
[3:25:53] &gt;&gt; I don't want water. I want He pointed
[3:25:57] up."
[3:25:58] &gt;&gt; And he said, "No, I just want to go."
[3:26:02] &gt;&gt; Then he started singing.
[3:26:09] &gt;&gt; He changed the song. my my my situation
[3:26:12] &gt;&gt; and he said and said my situation
[3:26:16] &gt;&gt; it will not continue the same
[3:26:18] &gt;&gt; and he he sang the song
[3:26:21] &gt;&gt; and he said join me let's sing
[3:26:23] &gt;&gt; and asked sister to join him
[3:26:25] &gt;&gt; and he said let's sing
[3:26:30] the
[3:26:32] last
[3:26:33] &gt;&gt; we played
[3:26:38] he started dancing
[3:26:41] We danced.
[3:26:43] &gt;&gt; We joined him.
[3:26:46] &gt;&gt; And when it came to um the part where it
[3:26:49] says
[3:26:52] &gt;&gt; this temple,
[3:26:53] &gt;&gt; yes, this temple and then he will say
[3:26:55] this temple with a smile
[3:26:58] &gt;&gt; and he will say very soon this temple
[3:27:02] &gt;&gt; and then he'll just laugh.
[3:27:04] After singing,
[3:27:07] he spoke to to
[3:27:10] he said,
[3:27:12] "You need to listen to me.
[3:27:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to heaven.
[3:27:17] You wait for Jesus
[3:27:20] &gt;&gt; because I'm going."
[3:27:22] And he said, "Um,
[3:27:25] listen to what I'm saying.
[3:27:27] I'm going to heaven."
[3:27:29] Little did you know that he really meant
[3:27:32] it this time.
[3:27:35] And um I also believe that
[3:27:38] our father is not dead.
[3:27:42] It's not that we are strong.
[3:27:45] &gt;&gt; It's just that he taught us
[3:27:47] that God is God in all the situations.
[3:27:52] And even in this situation,
[3:27:56] we are sad
[3:27:58] that we won't see him again.
[3:28:00] But we are very happy that he's in a
[3:28:03] better place.
[3:28:06] And as my sister said,
[3:28:09] &gt;&gt; we also believe that we will um stick to
[3:28:15] the ministry
[3:28:17] until rapture.
[3:28:19] God bless you.
[3:28:24] [applause]
[3:28:26] Okay. Um there was no song.
[3:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:28:30] It's we are done.
[3:28:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's just give them a
[3:28:34] round of applause
[3:28:37] &gt;&gt; and encourage them
[3:28:40] uh the family
[3:28:42] that has been around our pastor. He has
[3:28:46] produced.
[3:28:50] It was his first church.
[3:28:54] you're first the pastor of your home
[3:28:56] before you
[3:28:58] pastor to others.
[3:29:02] I think there is a speech of Omar
[3:29:07] the the wife of our beloved pastor
[3:29:11] and uh our mother. [music]
[3:29:15] So for us not to just disturb her,
[3:29:20] I think the speech is given by the
[3:29:23] family to pastor Salm
[3:29:28] so that he may come to read the speech
[3:29:33] on behalf of sister.
[3:29:41] God bless you. Amen.
[3:29:50] So uh
[3:29:52] uh I've been uh asked to read for mama
[3:29:58] and uh this message she addressed
[3:30:00] directly to her husband
[3:30:05] because it's entitled to my husband.
[3:30:11] I just read

[3:30:25] &gt;&gt; I want to thank you
[3:30:28] that you were part of my life.
[3:30:34] You taught me to know and fear the Lord.
[3:30:39] You never compromise the word.
[3:30:44] I will miss you physically
[3:30:49] but spiritually I am rich.
[3:30:54] Even when you are not here
[3:30:58] physically
[3:31:00] but your theophony body
[3:31:04] is operating in your house.
[3:31:09] You left me with an angel
[3:31:15] Michael
[3:31:17] &gt;&gt; who was visible when they come to kill
[3:31:19] you.
[3:31:25] I'm going to miss our fellowship
[3:31:30] that we used to have together
[3:31:35] about the eastern gates,
[3:31:39] &gt;&gt; Mount Olives,

[3:31:43] &gt;&gt; River Euphrates
[3:31:47] and the prayer you always say for us.

[3:32:38] who [snorts] made himself available
[3:32:44] for this homegoing service for us,
[3:32:51] especially the pastors who had to take
[3:32:54] flights
[3:32:58] from out of the country.
[3:33:02] I just want you to give a round of
[3:33:04] applause for them.
[3:33:11] They have made us to feel special.
[3:33:16] They also did treat the pastor in a very
[3:33:20] special way.

[3:33:26] of South Africa,
[3:33:30] we have been always received like
[3:33:33] diplomats
[3:33:38] officials.

[3:33:43] protocols.
[3:33:50] Sometimes I I remember we land
[3:33:55] and there is a car that come at the door
[3:33:58] of the aircraft.

[3:34:13] for all that you have done for the
[3:34:17] the ministry of pastor.

[3:34:40] that I would like to mention here

[3:41:49] is it pastor
[3:41:53] can be given one minute or so say
[3:41:56] something then we are going to pass the
[3:42:00] service for the word of God.
[3:42:05] So far we have done
[3:42:07] we have done it so good.
[3:42:12] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[3:42:12] &gt;&gt; as it was planned.
[3:42:15] One minute to pastor Pal
[3:42:19] then we are going to hear the
[3:42:23] consolation the comfort that come
[3:42:26] from the word of God.
[3:42:36] &gt;&gt; Are we tired?
[3:42:39] No, we can't be tired.
[3:42:42] Like pastor Madiva was saying yesterday
[3:42:46] will preach for 4 hours.
[3:42:50] Perhaps you've already heard
[3:42:54] and I
[3:42:56] and he says not
[3:43:00] and he says not John
[3:43:03] or surprised
[3:43:07] never feel anything is out of place
[3:43:15] when praises and good ways are said
[3:43:18] about a man that has laid to is laid to
[3:43:22] rest.
[3:43:27] In fact, this is the better time to
[3:43:29] speak about anyone who is doing well.
[3:43:36] Many times when people are still alive
[3:43:40] and much is said about them,
[3:43:45] they they pick up
[3:43:48] some complex.
[3:43:54] But
[3:43:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus says about John,
[3:44:01] &gt;&gt; he says, "No one born by a woman is
[3:44:05] greater than this man."
[3:44:10] But then he brings a a big problem in my
[3:44:13] thinking.
[3:44:18] that the least in the kingdom of God
[3:44:24] is greater than him.
[3:44:30] friends.
[3:44:32] May God bless you.
[3:44:36] &gt;&gt; The brother you're talking about,
[3:44:40] when I hear there were criticisms from
[3:44:42] many other pastors,
[3:44:48] I knew they had never lived close to
[3:44:50] this man.
[3:44:54] When Pastor Kurima tells you of the
[3:44:56] things that he experienced,
[3:45:02] You get so captivated into what he is
[3:45:04] saying
[3:45:08] and one thing you are going to admit
[3:45:13] we are not on the same level
[3:45:18] he spoke of one of the experiences I
[3:45:20] think speaking about when they were
[3:45:22] passing SS or SNS I don't know
[3:45:33] And these are not things that you read
[3:45:35] in the newspaper that you hear on daily
[3:45:38] news.
[3:45:44] And whatever he said
[3:45:47] and whatever people say and all that
[3:45:50] they tell,
[3:45:53] let us admit friends.
[3:45:56] God has given us differently.
[3:46:01] And if he has given more to my friends,
[3:46:06] I have no reason to be jealous.
[3:46:13] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[3:46:15] &gt;&gt; But here is
[3:46:17] here is a gateway.
[3:46:20] &gt;&gt; The list in the kingdom of God.
[3:46:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know how many people are
[3:46:28] included in this.
[3:46:34] The speaker Christ I can count him to be
[3:46:37] among the least.
[3:46:43] Because he says,
[3:46:49] "My God, my God, why hast thou for
[3:46:56] a choir in the message
[3:47:01] believers
[3:47:04] speak about somebody born in 1909.
[3:47:10] 1909
[3:47:15] and what you read from what they say
[3:47:20] and perhaps
[3:47:22] I'll say it in the lyric they are
[3:47:24] singing it
[3:47:29] alone
[3:47:31] forsaken by faith and by man till an
[3:47:35] angel came down
[3:47:38] so he would understand he was God's
[3:47:41] chosen man.
[3:47:44] God bless you.
[3:47:56] Amen.
[3:47:58] We can say indeed that we
[3:48:03] are the greatest beneficiaries,
[3:48:10] the life, the gifts
[3:48:14] and the character
[3:48:16] that was in pastor Israel.
[3:48:20] I believe uh the end of his body is not
[3:48:25] his end.
[3:48:29] The body can go away
[3:48:34] but his ministry will continue.
[3:48:39] the angel of the Lord
[3:48:42] who has been around him
[3:48:46] who will continue supporting each and
[3:48:48] everyone
[3:48:52] in the body. We will really him.
[3:48:56] We will miss him but in the spirit
[3:49:01] the power that was around his life
[3:49:06] continue controlling.
[3:49:10] I know the best way we can feel some
[3:49:14] consolation,
[3:49:17] some comfort in our hearts
[3:49:20] is by listening to the word of God.
[3:49:25] So now I think we need to stand on our
[3:49:29] feet
[3:49:31] as we are going to invite the minister
[3:49:34] of the day,
[3:49:37] &gt;&gt; our precious pastor.
[3:49:50] Amen.
[3:49:53] as we can
[3:49:58] [music]
[3:50:01] as they are fixing the stage here. Can
[3:50:04] we just have a song that we invite our
[3:50:07] pastor
[3:50:09] on the pulpit?
[3:50:11] Let's just open our hearts.
[3:50:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:50:14] &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord has something
[3:50:19] that he will say unto us [singing]
[3:50:22] that will strengthen us
[3:50:26] so that our pastor
[3:50:29] can be lay [music]
[3:50:32] in its last place.
[3:50:36] God bless you.
[3:50:40] But in the days [singing]
[3:50:43] of the voice
[3:50:45] of [singing and music] the
[3:50:49] and a child
[3:50:51] when [music and singing]
[3:50:54] She
[3:50:57] [singing] is [music]
[3:50:59] so
[3:51:04] [music]
[3:51:09] [music]
[3:51:14] [singing]
[3:51:18] [music]
[3:51:23] He
[3:51:29] [music]
[3:51:31] prophet
[3:51:34] [music]
[3:51:41] [music]
[3:51:43] [singing]
[3:51:46] shall take
[3:51:49] the house [music]
[3:51:51] of the father.
[3:51:54] So my children
[3:51:59] [music]
[3:52:04] [music]
[3:52:09] I [singing]
[3:52:13] [music]
[3:52:18] [singing]
[3:52:19] Holy [music]
[3:52:27] [music]
[3:52:28] [singing]
[3:52:32] Ghost
[3:52:35] [music]
[3:52:40] [singing]
[3:52:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:52:43] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[3:52:52] [music]
[3:52:58] [music]
[3:53:00] holy ghost.
[3:53:07] Amen.
[3:53:09] [music]
[3:53:11] Amen. I greet all of you in the name of
[3:53:14] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:53:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to greet again. I greet all of
[3:53:22] you in the name of our Lord Jesus
[3:53:24] Christ.
[3:53:27] Amen.
[3:53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:53:29] &gt;&gt; We
[3:53:31] we appreciate the Lord today.
[3:53:36] Uh maybe unbelievers would wonder why
[3:53:39] would you appreciate the Lord during a
[3:53:41] funeral
[3:53:47] and we want to tell them
[3:53:52] a believer does not die
[3:53:58] and
[3:54:05] You can't box him in a box.
[3:54:11] You can put his remains in a coffin.
[3:54:17] But the realtor,
[3:54:20] you can't put him in a coffin.
[3:54:24] If he was here,
[3:54:26] &gt;&gt; he was going to tell you,
[3:54:29] &gt;&gt; I rotated of God.
[3:54:34] Then I took this body,
[3:54:37] but this body is not me.
[3:54:40] I left the body
[3:54:43] and the got together
[3:54:47] to put the remains in the pot.
[3:54:52] So he's not in the box.
[3:54:56] He is a young man
[3:54:59] &gt;&gt; in another dimension.
[3:55:04] This is a downgrade.
[3:55:07] But has been upgraded.
[3:55:12] He's a young man.
[3:55:14] There's no sugar diabetes way.
[3:55:18] There is no hospital way.
[3:55:21] He is in the presence of the saints.
[3:55:23] Amen.
[3:55:25] I believe he must have walked in
[3:55:30] and pastoral said
[3:55:34] now he has arrived the likes of brother
[3:55:38] the likes of brother
[3:55:41] all the likes of brother
[3:55:44] they must have had a corner
[3:55:51] and that I'm here our message will make
[3:55:54] you arrive.
[3:55:58] I want to repeat. Our message will make
[3:56:00] you arrive.
[3:56:03] Our message has got an answer to death.
[3:56:08] Our message has got an answer to the
[3:56:10] grave.
[3:56:14] Our message has got an answer to hell.
[3:56:19] That's why this morning we are not
[3:56:21] shaken.
[3:56:25] I was wondering when we were in the
[3:56:27] hospital.
[3:56:30] The doctor came to us
[3:56:33] and he said he mentioned a very striking
[3:56:38] phrase.
[3:56:41] He said to us, I'm going to allow you to
[3:56:44] sit. Don't sit. We want to read the
[3:56:45] scripture.
[3:56:48] But but the family can sit, but you
[3:56:50] remain.
[3:56:54] The doctor was begging us.
[3:56:58] I say release him.
[3:57:01] Then I was wondering
[3:57:04] why is the p the doctor asking us to
[3:57:06] release him.
[3:57:09] Do do we have the power or not have the
[3:57:11] power?
[3:57:13] But then later I realized that there is
[3:57:16] a sister at Brenham Tabernacle
[3:57:19] who was told that she was going to die.
[3:57:23] But later based on what she did
[3:57:28] then it was said that she will not die.
[3:57:31] Then I realized the doctor believes
[3:57:35] that our prayers can hold the pastor.
[3:57:40] He had to ask us a permission
[3:57:43] that he let him go.
[3:57:46] Then we gathered around the beds
[3:57:49] and we had a prayer. I've seen
[3:57:51] unbelievers die.
[3:57:54] They scream at the top of their voices.
[3:57:58] But I saw this old man peacefully
[3:58:03] transitioning.
[3:58:06] As I was talking to him,
[3:58:08] he kept on nodding.
[3:58:11] I say, "You taught us the seven seal,
[3:58:15] then he nodded. You taught us the
[3:58:17] revelation of the son of man,
[3:58:20] then he noded. You taught us the
[3:58:22] resurrection.
[3:58:24] You You taught us the rapture. Then in
[3:58:27] no time, he slipped off."
[3:58:33] So pastor is in a better place.
[3:58:38] Amen. Amen.
[3:58:41] &gt;&gt; God bless you pastors.
[3:58:44] &gt;&gt; Second Timothy
[3:58:47] &gt;&gt; chapter 4.
[3:58:48] &gt;&gt; Chapter 4 verse 6.
[3:58:50] &gt;&gt; Verse 6.
[3:58:52] &gt;&gt; Is brother harvest here?
[3:58:53] &gt;&gt; Brother
[3:58:57] &gt;&gt; to help us read. If he's not here, we
[3:58:59] will read.
[3:59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. For I am now ready to be offered,
[3:59:04] and the time of my departure is at hand.
[3:59:08] I have fought a good fight. I have
[3:59:11] finished my course. I have kept the
[3:59:14] faith. Henceforth there is laid up for
[3:59:18] me a crown of righteousness, which the
[3:59:21] Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me
[3:59:24] at that day, and not to me only, but
[3:59:27] unto all them also that love his
[3:59:30] appearing.
[3:59:31] &gt;&gt; As we bow our heads, our gracious
[3:59:33] heavenly father.
[3:59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:59:34] &gt;&gt; Here is a scripture that you have read.
[3:59:37] We depend on your anointing. And here is
[3:59:41] the family, friends, the congregation,
[3:59:44] pastors who are here. Lord, they've
[3:59:47] spoken and we're comforting one another.
[3:59:50] But Lord, the word is the greatest
[3:59:52] comforter.
[3:59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:59:54] &gt;&gt; And at this point in time, we commit the
[3:59:56] reading of the word to you for your
[3:59:58] glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[4:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you richly as you take
[4:00:03] your seats.
[4:00:07] We will not be long.
[4:00:11] &gt;&gt; In no time we are leaving.
[4:00:17] &gt;&gt; I was looking at this words
[4:00:23] for I am now ready to be offered
[4:00:30] and the time of my departure is at hand.
[4:00:36] And when I was reading these words,
[4:00:39] I know they were spoken by St. Paul,
[4:00:45] but when I was reading these words,
[4:00:48] pastor came to mind
[4:00:53] because if you hear from the speeches,
[4:00:58] his departure did not take him by
[4:01:00] surprise.
[4:01:05] He was ready to go.
[4:01:08] He was willing to go.
[4:01:11] He was not afraid of death.
[4:01:15] Then Paul says
[4:01:18] my the time of my departure is at hand.
[4:01:23] Now we find that death
[4:01:27] is a departure.
[4:01:30] We find that death
[4:01:32] is a change of a dwelling place.
[4:01:36] We find that death
[4:01:38] does not change you.
[4:01:41] If you die being a crook,
[4:01:45] you remain a crook.
[4:01:48] If you die being a believer,
[4:01:51] you remain a believer.
[4:01:54] If you die being a liar,
[4:01:57] you come back as a liar.
[4:02:00] And let me maybe take it further.
[4:02:03] When you die being a prophet,
[4:02:07] you still are a prophet.
[4:02:09] &gt;&gt; If you die being a pastor,
[4:02:12] you are still a pastor.
[4:02:14] Pastor is still your pastor.
[4:02:18] Death did not change him.
[4:02:21] But death change his dwelling place.
[4:02:24] I hope we are together.
[4:02:26] The prophet of God says showing one
[4:02:29] thing
[4:02:32] that men when you die or whatever
[4:02:37] when you leave this world
[4:02:39] your nature doesn't change
[4:02:43] this morning this afternoon.
[4:02:46] Our sermon is not intended to change
[4:02:48] anything.
[4:02:52] It is just to confirm who pastor was.
[4:02:58] It's just to confirm that he was a
[4:02:59] believer before death
[4:03:03] and he still a believer after death.
[4:03:07] It is to confirm
[4:03:09] that nothing has changed about him.
[4:03:13] If he was loving,
[4:03:15] he's still loving.
[4:03:17] If he was forgiving,
[4:03:19] he's still forgiving now. Nothing has
[4:03:22] changed about pastor. He just changed a
[4:03:26] 20
[4:03:29] and the prophet says if you are a liar
[4:03:31] now
[4:03:33] you will be a liar.
[4:03:36] If you are hotheaded here
[4:03:39] you will be here.
[4:03:41] If you are a doubter here
[4:03:44] you will be a doubter.
[4:03:46] And if you are a believer here, you will
[4:03:49] be a believer here.
[4:03:51] Hallelujah.
[4:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:03:53] &gt;&gt; It says men and women,
[4:03:55] it's time to shake ourselves
[4:03:59] to examine ourselves.
[4:04:02] Pastor is gone.
[4:04:04] But I want to speak to you because he
[4:04:07] left a big shoes.
[4:04:11] You know, we have been fortunate
[4:04:14] to have crossed paths.
[4:04:17] with such a great man,
[4:04:20] a man that has labored
[4:04:23] not only for two years,
[4:04:25] for over 50 years.
[4:04:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm standing here. I'm looking at
[4:04:31] families
[4:04:33] that came under this ministry.
[4:04:36] I'm looking at young men
[4:04:39] that came out of this ministry.
[4:04:41] I'm looking at young women
[4:04:44] that came out of this ministry.
[4:04:46] I'm looking at pastors
[4:04:48] that came out of this ministry. I'm
[4:04:51] looking at congregations
[4:04:53] that came out of this ministry. And I
[4:04:56] don't know how many of you say
[4:04:59] I'm a trophy
[4:05:01] of pastor's ministry.
[4:05:04] I want you I'm not ashamed to say that I
[4:05:08] am a trophy of pastor's ministry and I
[4:05:12] believe there are witnesses here and I
[4:05:15] believe the pastors in Congo
[4:05:18] they can say we are the trophies
[4:05:21] ministry the pastors in Malawi
[4:05:25] they can say we are trophies
[4:05:28] the pastors in
[4:05:30] they can say we are
[4:05:32] let me tell you something when a man has
[4:05:35] done great
[4:05:37] you must acknowledge what a man has done
[4:05:40] don't become don't become jealous
[4:05:44] some of you you were not born
[4:05:46] when pastor was boarding a bus
[4:05:50] some of you you were not there
[4:05:52] even some of his critics were not born
[4:05:57] this man has labor
[4:05:59] this man has kept the faith
[4:06:02] not for 5 years after over 50 years.
[4:06:07] He still kept the faith.
[4:06:10] Today this afternoon we want to
[4:06:12] celebrate
[4:06:14] Pastor Israel.
[4:06:16] We want to acknowledge
[4:06:18] the labors of his love.
[4:06:25] Paul says, "I have fought a good fight.
[4:06:32] Maybe just to you know young ministers
[4:06:38] they think that a ministry
[4:06:40] is when we are wearing microphones
[4:06:44] &gt;&gt; and cameras are running
[4:06:46] lights are on
[4:06:48] songs are going on.
[4:06:50] I've got sad news for you.
[4:06:53] It's only 10%.
[4:06:56] A lot is going on
[4:06:58] behind this scene. Every time when your
[4:07:01] pastor comes to preach,
[4:07:04] you would have fought many battles.
[4:07:07] When you see your pastor behind the
[4:07:08] pulpit,
[4:07:10] you must know that it's victory.
[4:07:14] Here I'm talking about real pastors.
[4:07:17] I'm not talking about t collectors.
[4:07:20] I'm not talking about Sunday collectors.
[4:07:25] I'm talking about bonafideed pastors,
[4:07:28] pastors that have got rebellion
[4:07:32] for the people
[4:07:34] on their hearts. So pastoring is a
[4:07:37] warfare.
[4:07:40] I thought the pastors will say
[4:07:43] pastor pastoring is a warfare
[4:07:47] because one day
[4:07:49] uh somebody tells you
[4:07:52] pastor God has spoken through you
[4:07:56] God has spoken through you next week
[4:08:00] there's the same person I said the devil
[4:08:02] spoke through you
[4:08:05] and when you are a pastor you must be
[4:08:07] able not to be affected
[4:08:11] by compliments
[4:08:13] and even by critics because you are
[4:08:16] focused
[4:08:18] is the master.
[4:08:21] I say our focus
[4:08:24] is our master. So pastoring
[4:08:28] is a warfare against sin.
[4:08:33] Sin is unbelief.
[4:08:35] So that means pastor
[4:08:37] for 50 years plus he was waring
[4:08:43] against sin against unbelief
[4:08:47] against despair
[4:08:50] against erosion of the truth.
[4:08:55] And I believe many times pastor
[4:09:00] stood behind many pulpits
[4:09:04] with his body ache.
[4:09:09] One brother was telling me
[4:09:12] and said there was a time when he was
[4:09:14] sick. He spent most of the time
[4:09:18] standing on one leg
[4:09:21] because another leg was painful.
[4:09:24] What made pastor to do that?
[4:09:28] Constraint him.
[4:09:30] It was not money. He looked at the
[4:09:32] people and say I'm their shepherd. I'm
[4:09:36] going to preach for them when I'm happy
[4:09:39] and when I'm not happy, when I'm sick
[4:09:42] and when I'm not sick and I want to say
[4:09:45] he has never failed
[4:09:48] in his post of duty.
[4:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:09:55] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[4:09:56] &gt;&gt; He cancelled
[4:10:01] &gt;&gt; through the night.
[4:10:05] &gt;&gt; Then in the upper room,
[4:10:08] time stopped.
[4:10:12] You were not rushed.
[4:10:15] Your matter was attended to
[4:10:20] if it was attended
[4:10:23] until the we hours of the morning.
[4:10:26] The man of God was there
[4:10:29] not rushing you attending to you.
[4:10:33] Why? Because he loved you. I want to say
[4:10:37] to mommy church,
[4:10:39] your pastor loved you.
[4:10:41] Don't believe anything else.
[4:10:53] He named his sin without flinching.
[4:10:56] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[4:10:57] &gt;&gt; He named s without sin.
[4:11:01] Without flinching.
[4:11:04] &gt;&gt; You know, you'll bear with me. Pastors,
[4:11:07] a lot of pastors, if sin comes in their
[4:11:10] family,
[4:11:13] They look the other way.
[4:11:16] But they would ask his family,
[4:11:19] not this man. Sin was sin.
[4:11:23] Whether in church, whether in another
[4:11:26] family, whether in his family, he called
[4:11:29] it out.
[4:11:31] Why? He was a man of integrity.
[4:11:39] He fought for marriages that were on the
[4:11:41] brink.
[4:11:47] &gt;&gt; He fought for teenagers
[4:11:50] teenagers
[4:11:50] &gt;&gt; that were wandering far from home.
[4:11:54] Whenever you went to his house, you
[4:11:57] always found a new face
[4:12:00] and they say, "Pastor picked up this boy
[4:12:02] from somewhere."
[4:12:05] Because why? He was a parent. He was a
[4:12:09] father. He had a feeling for the people.
[4:12:14] He fought for widows
[4:12:18] who had nowhere else to call.
[4:12:23] And I want to say to challenge the
[4:12:26] trustees.
[4:12:30] Pastor believed
[4:12:33] that if the roof of a widow is leaking,
[4:12:40] it does not need to pray request.
[4:12:44] We don't pray about it.
[4:12:47] We do something about it.
[4:12:50] That's what pastor believed.
[4:12:58] He fought battles in many hospital
[4:13:01] hospital rooms.
[4:13:07] Some of you he visited in the hospitals.
[4:13:12] He even fought death itself
[4:13:17] with a weapon of Malachia 4 gospel.
[4:13:25] Now today I want to ask a question.
[4:13:30] Oh death,
[4:13:32] &gt;&gt; where is your victory?
[4:13:39] Death has no victory.
[4:13:43] And pastor proved
[4:13:48] that death has no victory.
[4:13:52] He fought well
[4:13:55] &gt;&gt; because he fought on his knees.
[4:14:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says
[4:14:03] &gt;&gt; and this is particularly to the mud
[4:14:05] church
[4:14:07] after the shepherd is gone
[4:14:11] the devil goes on the rampage.
[4:14:18] But I want to assure you
[4:14:20] the God of pastor
[4:14:24] will be with
[4:14:30] and he will finish what he started.
[4:14:35] If the enemy comes,
[4:14:38] believe me, the enemy will be defeated.
[4:14:44] And the enemy is not your brother.
[4:14:47] The enemy is not your sister,
[4:14:50] but the enemy is Satan.
[4:14:52] And I say Satan will be defeated.
[4:14:58] Amen.
[4:14:58] &gt;&gt; So he fought the good fight.
[4:15:04] Brother Brennham says, "And real true
[4:15:07] battles
[4:15:11] are not made with selfish motives.
[4:15:18] Wars are not fought for money.
[4:15:24] Wars are fought for principles.
[4:15:37] None of them included money.
[4:15:42] All included principles.
[4:15:45] And I want to encourage the church.
[4:15:49] Keep on on that trajectory.
[4:15:52] Fighting for principle,
[4:15:55] not for position,
[4:15:57] not for power, not for members.
[4:16:02] fighting the enemy
[4:16:04] which is Satan.
[4:16:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says, "When Abraham went
[4:16:13] out to get Lord,
[4:16:16] &gt;&gt; he didn't go out because he know he
[4:16:17] could whip the kings
[4:16:21] and take their possession.
[4:16:24] He went out for the principle
[4:16:28] of saving his brother.
[4:16:31] And I want that Abrahamic material
[4:16:37] must be found in Mord
[4:16:40] where you are fighting for principles,
[4:16:45] to save your brother,
[4:16:47] to save your sister,
[4:16:50] not for your recognition,
[4:16:52] but to save one another.
[4:16:57] He displayed selflessness
[4:17:01] and we want to see the church
[4:17:04] displaying that value that he has
[4:17:06] displayed.
[4:17:11] I hope we are together.
[4:17:14] Second Timothy 4 7 Timothy 4:7
[4:17:18] &gt;&gt; he says another phrase
[4:17:21] &gt;&gt; I have finished my course.
[4:17:28] would have never left
[4:17:31] until God's purpose with his life is
[4:17:33] fulfilled.
[4:17:38] Maybe let me read this quotation
[4:17:41] because I want to say something.
[4:17:44] The prophecy in the unveiling of God,
[4:17:48] it says notice then we become part of
[4:17:51] him.
[4:17:53] As as you are the veil that veins him,
[4:17:59] we're going to repeat this. As you are
[4:18:01] the veil that veils you,
[4:18:05] you are a part of him. As long as Christ
[4:18:08] is in you,
[4:18:10] Christ was of God.
[4:18:13] If God was in him, we made him God.
[4:18:18] And as Christ is in you,
[4:18:21] the hope of glory, you become a part of
[4:18:24] Christ.
[4:18:26] You become part of Christ. As long as
[4:18:29] Christ is hid in you,
[4:18:32] then it's it's a veiled to the
[4:18:34] unbeliever.
[4:18:36] But you know he is in you.
[4:18:40] You are templing Christ.
[4:18:43] that's behind the veil
[4:18:46] is the skin
[4:18:48] because of this veil. The veil again
[4:18:53] in human flesh
[4:18:56] hides God
[4:18:58] the word from the unbeliever.
[4:19:02] So we are talking to the believers here.
[4:19:05] You know Tommy Osbborne,
[4:19:06] &gt;&gt; Tommy Osbbor
[4:19:07] &gt;&gt; during the memorial of brotherh
[4:19:09] Brennham,
[4:19:12] &gt;&gt; he says, "We have heard
[4:19:14] about Jesus Christ that walked to the
[4:19:17] shores of Galilee
[4:19:20] in our generation.
[4:19:22] Jesus Christ walked to the streets of
[4:19:25] Jefferson.
[4:19:29] What was happening? William Brham became
[4:19:32] a faith of God in our generation. And I
[4:19:37] am not ashamed that in our generation
[4:19:41] in this area
[4:19:43] we have seen Jesus Christ
[4:19:46] behind a simple man.
[4:19:49] He walked the streets of Modi.
[4:19:53] He walked the streets of
[4:19:56] he walked the streets of Switzerland.
[4:20:00] You will only believe it when it applies
[4:20:02] to you.
[4:20:04] When Christ is in you, you will know
[4:20:07] that he's in another person.
[4:20:10] We have seen in this day Jesus Christ
[4:20:15] walking in human form.
[4:20:26] &gt;&gt; That one is not for unbelievers.
[4:20:29] This is for the believers. Do you
[4:20:32] believe that you are the veils of God?
[4:20:36] Do you believe this was a veil of God?
[4:20:41] It was not pastor preaching to you.
[4:20:45] But it was the Lord himself.
[4:20:48] He hid himself behind a
[4:20:52] listen to me. In this generation, we see
[4:20:55] a man coming
[4:20:57] and he speaks a broken grammar.
[4:21:02] He says to the people, "I'm not much of
[4:21:05] a preacher."
[4:21:07] But we, the predestinated seed,
[4:21:12] we the elect when he was speaking the
[4:21:16] broken grammar,
[4:21:18] we went beyond the broken grammar
[4:21:22] and realized that the same God
[4:21:26] that was with Abraham,
[4:21:28] he has come again in our generation.
[4:21:32] And I want to say
[4:21:35] blessed mommy.
[4:21:37] You are pastor
[4:21:40] God hid behind him.
[4:21:51] Paul says
[4:21:53] &gt;&gt; I have kept
[4:21:55] &gt;&gt; the faith.
[4:21:58] People don't keep the faith anymore.
[4:22:03] What is our faith?
[4:22:06] It is the faith that was once delivered
[4:22:10] to the saints.
[4:22:12] Paul says, "I kept that faith."
[4:22:16] Let me let me I want to say something.
[4:22:19] Brother Brennham says in our generation
[4:22:23] we have three head planters.
[4:22:27] He say we've got Oral Roberts
[4:22:30] &gt;&gt; and we says we've got Billy Graham. Then
[4:22:33] he says we had the we had the word
[4:22:35] planter.
[4:22:38] Now listen to me. He says oral Robert
[4:22:42] &gt;&gt; was for the Pentecostal
[4:22:45] &gt;&gt; and Billy Graham
[4:22:47] &gt;&gt; was for the denomination.
[4:22:51] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Billy Graham
[4:22:54] Bill was a man of God but he was not
[4:22:57] sent to the bride.
[4:23:02] His ministry cannot change a body.
[4:23:06] His ministry does not have the rapturing
[4:23:09] faith.
[4:23:11] The ministry of Billy Graham,
[4:23:14] &gt;&gt; great as it was,
[4:23:17] it does not have the rapture faith. But
[4:23:20] listen to my statement. Three seeds
[4:23:24] have been planted in our generation.
[4:23:28] Pastor
[4:23:29] I have known him for years. He would
[4:23:32] have never taken
[4:23:34] He would have never
[4:23:36] he would have
[4:23:39] he would have never taken the sermon of
[4:23:42] Billy Graham
[4:23:44] &gt;&gt; to come and preach to
[4:23:47] no no because why his influence
[4:23:52] it was not from oral
[4:23:54] it was not from Billy Graham it was
[4:24:01] remember the two went to Sodom.
[4:24:05] But another one remained with Abraham.
[4:24:10] And when he remained with Abraham, he
[4:24:12] says, Abraham, where is Sarah thy wife?
[4:24:16] What was happening? It was not in
[4:24:18] sorrow. It was not among Janice and
[4:24:23] this was a thirdful ministry.
[4:24:26] This was God in flesh.
[4:24:32] Then Sarah
[4:24:35] &gt;&gt; when he heard
[4:24:37] Abracale
[4:24:40] &gt;&gt; promising that according to the time of
[4:24:42] life
[4:24:44] I shall return and thy wife shall have a
[4:24:48] son. Who was that? Who was that in the
[4:24:53] house
[4:24:55] of Abraham? The same one that was in the
[4:24:59] house of Abraham
[4:25:01] in our time. He was in the house of
[4:25:04] sister.
[4:25:06] &gt;&gt; And today the same one has not gone
[4:25:10] back. He is here.
[4:25:14] Amen.
[4:25:19] Yes sir. Because we are bearing an elder
[4:25:22] here.
[4:25:24] I can address ministers.
[4:25:27] Leave TD J alone.
[4:25:30] Leave Joel Austin alone.
[4:25:33] They've got no material for the bride.
[4:25:37] &gt;&gt; The material for the bride is withhal.
[4:25:52] I mean, if you're a minister
[4:25:55] and you come and preach to us, woman,
[4:25:58] thou art loose.
[4:26:00] What nonsense is that? That's a
[4:26:02] Pentecostal thing.
[4:26:05] Stop bringing sermons of Pentecostals,
[4:26:09] dressing them with message calls.
[4:26:13] Here is a man. 50 years later, marriages
[4:26:17] are standing here.
[4:26:21] He does not have a scandal.
[4:26:26] &gt;&gt; Pastor does not have a scandal.
[4:26:30] Anna doesn't have one single scand
[4:26:38] for many years. He stayed only with one
[4:26:41] woman.
[4:26:46] Today,
[4:26:48] men behind the pullpits
[4:26:52] have girlfriends
[4:26:54] in the pews
[4:26:57] in the pews.
[4:27:00] Amen.
[4:27:03] Amen. But not this man.
[4:27:06] 50 years late.
[4:27:09] One wife.
[4:27:11] I think this deserves a round of
[4:27:13] applause.
[4:27:17] I think this deserves a celebration.
[4:27:22] 50 years later,
[4:27:24] &gt;&gt; he kept the faith.
[4:27:38] &gt;&gt; Now usually
[4:27:40] you know sometime
[4:27:44] if We have had great men.
[4:27:48] Brother Biscal was a great man.
[4:27:51] When you speak about Bis,
[4:27:54] &gt;&gt; African say amen.
[4:27:57] &gt;&gt; Then when you say pastor,
[4:27:59] &gt;&gt; we are guy.
[4:28:01] Where is he going now?
[4:28:05] &gt;&gt; You are a fool.
[4:28:10] &gt;&gt; You don't see what God is doing around
[4:28:12] you.
[4:28:16] The same God that use biscuit.
[4:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:28:29] &gt;&gt; I have kept the faith.
[4:28:34] When he came to the end,
[4:28:36] &gt;&gt; when when he came to the end,
[4:28:40] he kept the faith. I looked at I looked
[4:28:44] at him
[4:28:45] relaxed on that hospital bed.
[4:28:48] There was no panic at all.
[4:28:52] Relaxed knowing where he is going.
[4:29:01] Pastor was an elder
[4:29:06] and the prophet says
[4:29:08] now the truth of the matter is the word
[4:29:10] elder.
[4:29:14] signifies who the person is.
[4:29:20] One thing that I've learned
[4:29:23] &gt;&gt; about this old man
[4:29:25] never kept a grudge.
[4:29:31] How you can keep a grudge
[4:29:36] but not this.
[4:29:40] He treated friends
[4:29:43] and enemies
[4:29:45] same way.
[4:29:49] [applause]
[4:29:54] &gt;&gt; And I think that's what we must learn.
[4:29:56] Pastors,
[4:29:59] &gt;&gt; Peter
[4:30:01] was the friend of Jesus.
[4:30:04] But Jesus says to Peter, "You David,
[4:30:10] then Judas was the enemy of Jesus."
[4:30:14] &gt;&gt; And Jesus says to him, "My friend,
[4:30:18] &gt;&gt; the art of war." [laughter]
[4:30:27] Now the truth of the matter is
[4:30:30] the word elder
[4:30:33] signifies who the person is
[4:30:39] while the word bishop
[4:30:42] signifies the office of the same man.
[4:30:48] And I was wondering
[4:30:50] you go this way.
[4:30:53] So and so calls himself apostle.
[4:30:57] This corner, this one calls himself an
[4:30:59] apostle.
[4:31:01] And I was thinking
[4:31:03] that when they speak about pastor
[4:31:08] planting a church in
[4:31:11] planting a church in Limpopo
[4:31:13] &gt;&gt; and planting the church in Switzerland.
[4:31:16] This man was an apostle
[4:31:19] but he didn't call himself an apostle
[4:31:22] but his works
[4:31:24] identify him
[4:31:27] that this man was an apostle.
[4:31:33] The elder is the man.
[4:31:37] &gt;&gt; Bishop,
[4:31:39] &gt;&gt; the elder is the man.
[4:31:43] &gt;&gt; Bishop is the office of the man.
[4:31:48] Elder
[4:31:50] and this is where people do not know.
[4:31:54] I'm going to close. Not long.
[4:31:57] There is a difference
[4:31:59] between an elder
[4:32:02] and old man in church.
[4:32:09] Amen.
[4:32:09] &gt;&gt; Our problem, we think some old men
[4:32:14] are elders
[4:32:16] only to find that they just old men.
[4:32:26] An elder is a man of experience.
[4:32:31] An elder is a man whose life can back up
[4:32:34] his testimony.
[4:32:37] An
[4:32:39] elder is a unifier.
[4:32:43] An elder rises above petty things.
[4:32:54] Elder
[4:32:55] &gt;&gt; always
[4:32:57] has and always will refer
[4:33:02] to a to a man's chronological age.
[4:33:09] He doesn't stop there. In the Lord,
[4:33:14] not just a coronical age.
[4:33:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[4:33:18] &gt;&gt; But in the Lord,
[4:33:23] So
[4:33:24] don't just be in church,
[4:33:27] but be in the Lord.
[4:33:31] He says he's an elder,
[4:33:35] &gt;&gt; not because he's elected or ordained.
[4:33:41] You don't elect an elder.
[4:33:44] Circumstances
[4:33:46] will reveal
[4:33:48] who is an elder.
[4:33:51] John when no one was worthy to take the
[4:33:54] book
[4:33:56] to lose the sins of the Lord.
[4:34:00] John says, "Then I wept." Then the Bible
[4:34:04] says, "And the elder tapped him because
[4:34:08] an elder will bring a situation
[4:34:13] under control."
[4:34:16] He said, "John, we know there is a lion
[4:34:21] of the tribe of Judah
[4:34:24] already prevailed.
[4:34:30] And we thank God for the elders.
[4:34:35] Won't be what it is without elders.
[4:34:41] &gt;&gt; And can go forward
[4:34:45] unless we've got elders.
[4:34:48] Not just old men, but elders filled with
[4:34:51] the Holy Ghost
[4:34:53] that know what pastor
[4:34:58] stood for.
[4:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:35:04] [applause]
[4:35:10] [applause]
[4:35:13] &gt;&gt; You know,
[4:35:15] when you don't know what it cost,
[4:35:22] you're going to throw dust on this.
[4:35:28] Solomon Solom realized
[4:35:32] that oh these women are fighting for the
[4:35:35] baby
[4:35:37] and another one says this my baby
[4:35:41] and another one is dead and another one
[4:35:44] says I rather cut cut the baby in half
[4:35:49] so that I can get half then another
[4:35:51] woman say I don't want half I rather
[4:35:54] will not have the baby rather than to
[4:35:57] have her
[4:35:59] said that's the right one.
[4:36:02] Listen to me. If somebody calls into a
[4:36:05] corner, I want to split a church. You
[4:36:09] must remember that story of Solomon,
[4:36:14] a real man will say, "I want the whole
[4:36:17] church on nothing.
[4:36:20] I don't want to cut it into pieces.
[4:36:30] Even the way I preach it makes the devil
[4:36:32] uncomfortable.
[4:36:37] People say, "Why are you going there?"
[4:36:39] I'm going right there.
[4:36:43] Right there. Where you think I'm not
[4:36:45] going? I'm going right there.
[4:36:48] We want church to be united.
[4:36:54] It was united for over 50 years
[4:36:58] &gt;&gt; and it must be united another 50 years.
[4:37:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Bill, let's hear what an elder
[4:37:10] is. Amen.
[4:37:14] &gt;&gt; Young men, let me share. I I've been in
[4:37:17] the message as a young boy.
[4:37:25] And
[4:37:28] when somebody wants to play politics,
[4:37:33] they always gone for the gullible young
[4:37:36] people.
[4:37:44] I was almost a victim
[4:37:49] when I was a young man. A man wanted to
[4:37:52] play vict politics.
[4:37:56] But fortunately, he fell with a woman.
[4:38:00] Then I said, you know, I don't listen to
[4:38:03] this man.
[4:38:08] Now,
[4:38:10] brother Brennham says,
[4:38:13] &gt;&gt; "An elder
[4:38:16] is more seasoned."
[4:38:24] If you ask him, "Where did you start as
[4:38:27] mommy lord?"
[4:38:31] We'll tell you, "We started here,
[4:38:34] then we
[4:38:36] then we fought that
[4:38:38] because he's seasoned. [crying]
[4:38:44] &gt;&gt; If you see I see young men, they call
[4:38:47] each other elders today.
[4:38:53] Not even one one gray hair
[4:38:58] elder
[4:39:07] babies
[4:39:09] &gt;&gt; and the elder
[4:39:12] &gt;&gt; you know pastor taught me something
[4:39:17] one time he said to me brother
[4:39:21] there is a difference
[4:39:24] between a church that is swelling
[4:39:32] and the church that is growing.
[4:39:40] And one time in weed bank
[4:39:43] I once saw our church sailing
[4:39:49] and say we need to get chess.
[4:39:53] I said we don't need chess
[4:39:56] we need antibiotics.
[4:39:59] antibiotic.
[4:39:59] &gt;&gt; There is an infection
[4:40:02] infection. But who taught me that
[4:40:10] &gt;&gt; an elder
[4:40:12] &gt;&gt; more seasoned,
[4:40:17] trained,
[4:40:20] not a novice,
[4:40:24] reliable.
[4:40:27] was reliable.
[4:40:30] He was seasoned.
[4:40:33] He was trained.
[4:40:35] He was not a novice.
[4:40:38] He was reliable.
[4:40:40] He was dependable
[4:40:42] because of his experience
[4:40:46] and longstanding proof
[4:40:52] of his Christian experience.
[4:40:58] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[4:41:00] &gt;&gt; How many agree that pastor was an elder
[4:41:06] and how many say he was our elder.
[4:41:10] Amen.
[4:41:12] Then Paul says
[4:41:15] now I conclude.
[4:41:17] He says henceforth
[4:41:21] &gt;&gt; there is a laid up for me a crown of
[4:41:23] righteousness.
[4:41:31] Yes, here is there is a lady for up for
[4:41:33] me
[4:41:36] a crown
[4:41:37] &gt;&gt; of righteousness.
[4:41:40] Here is a man
[4:41:43] years back
[4:41:46] boarded a train
[4:41:49] going to
[4:41:53] &gt;&gt; getting off train.
[4:41:55] getting on a bus, going all the way to
[4:41:58] Bo
[4:42:00] to preach the gospel.
[4:42:02] Here is a man drove alone,
[4:42:06] no company
[4:42:08] over 2,000 kilometers
[4:42:15] to preach the gospel.
[4:42:17] Here is a man that never robbed anyone
[4:42:20] of their money. Here
[4:42:23] is a man who the money was not his
[4:42:26] focus.
[4:42:29] His focus was the souls.
[4:42:34] Brother Brennham says
[4:42:36] &gt;&gt; in the lamb's book of life 35 is the
[4:42:40] paragraph.
[4:42:42] Brother says, "But one soul saved,
[4:42:48] you will see your name wrapped into it
[4:42:54] as long as the minister shall glitter in
[4:42:56] the sky."
[4:42:59] And I want to conclude by saying every
[4:43:02] soul
[4:43:07] into the kingdom of God's
[4:43:09] name shall be wrapped around those
[4:43:12] souls. Hallelujah.
[4:43:15] Whether they in Malawi, whether they are
[4:43:18] in a whether they inhal,
[4:43:21] whether they in Malawi, whether they in
[4:43:23] Switzerland, whether they in whether
[4:43:26] they in
[4:43:29] Botswana, whether in Congo, his name
[4:43:32] will be wrapped
[4:43:35] around those souls.
[4:43:38] And on this way,
[4:43:40] in on this way,
[4:43:43] &gt;&gt; I say go well, soldier.
[4:43:46] Well, elder,
[4:43:48] you have done your part.
[4:43:50] You have served it to the best of your
[4:43:52] ability. Amen. You have served to the
[4:43:54] best of your ability.
[4:43:57] And I say go well,
[4:44:00] but before I close, I want to do
[4:44:02] something.
[4:44:05] I want all and this may be awkward
[4:44:08] because your mom may stand up.
[4:44:13] All the babies,
[4:44:16] even if you are 45 now,
[4:44:20] all the babies that were dedicated
[4:44:24] to Pastor Israeli,

[4:45:27] feet

[4:46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:46:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:46:46] Let us bow our heads and pray.
[4:46:49] Gracious heavenly father,
[4:46:54] indeed
[4:46:57] every one of us
[4:47:00] is preparing for a day like this.
[4:47:02] [snorts]
[4:47:04] Every one of us
[4:47:06] one day one by [music] one shall take
[4:47:09] the portal.
[4:47:12] Lord Jesus,
[4:47:14] if I would have to take the portal, I
[4:47:17] would like to take it the way Pastor
[4:47:19] Kimmer has done
[4:47:21] on the post of duty, [music]
[4:47:24] living a life,
[4:47:26] a living sacrifice
[4:47:31] to you, Lord. Thank you, Father, for the
[4:47:34] ministry.
[4:47:36] Thank you for the minister who was
[4:47:38] ministering to us. Father, bless him.
[4:47:42] Grant him more revelation so that when
[4:47:45] he comes back here, Father, we should
[4:47:48] always hear from the throne of God.
[4:47:51] As we are concluding this service, Lord,
[4:47:55] be with us wherever we will be. Father,
[4:47:58] let the Holy Ghost lead us. We have seen
[4:48:01] you working with us here. We have seen
[4:48:05] you keeping each and every one of us
[4:48:08] attentive to the message which has been
[4:48:10] preached. We want also to be protected
[4:48:13] on the way all the way to the grave
[4:48:15] site. Be with us as people who are
[4:48:18] crying. Be with us as people who are
[4:48:21] heavy at heart. Be with us as people who
[4:48:24] believe that there is resurrection.
[4:48:28] Help us father. There are so many of us
[4:48:31] here maybe who haven't believed this
[4:48:34] message. Let it [music] happen that the
[4:48:36] message which has been preached today
[4:48:38] should be a turning point that we should
[4:48:41] say the day [music] they were burying
[4:48:43] pastor Kodima that's the day my heart
[4:48:46] changed
[4:48:48] let it be a seed in [music] each and
[4:48:51] every unbelieving heart.
[4:48:54] We commit everything including the
[4:48:56] director of ceremonies, the drivers, the
[4:49:00] guards,
[4:49:01] the people who are helping us from the
[4:49:04] services. All of them father commit them
[4:49:07] into thine holy hands. Let your angels
[4:49:10] encamp around this place. For we hear
[4:49:12] the book saying, "Angels encamp about
[4:49:16] those who love the Lord." Let this
[4:49:19] angels be with us all over wherever
[4:49:21] we'll be going. Father, thank you Lord
[4:49:24] that you have given us men who can stand
[4:49:28] with the word. You have given us men who
[4:49:32] can be our fathers, who can given us men
[4:49:35] who can be our mentors.
[4:49:38] Thank you father. Everything
[4:49:41] we commit into thine holy hands father
[4:49:44] in Jesus Christ name we pray. Amen.
[4:50:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:50:19] &gt;&gt; Brothers, technical team.
[4:50:22] Uh the pastor
[4:50:26] uh pastor Edgar say he gave you a video
[4:50:33] &gt;&gt; is the video already
[4:50:37] where the pastor is
[4:50:40] waving by to the church.
[4:50:44] Uh as the brothers are preparing that
[4:50:50] I need brother
[4:50:52] here
[4:50:53] &gt;&gt; to come and
[4:50:55] &gt;&gt; help us with
[4:50:58] some
[4:51:00] announcements.
[4:51:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. As uh the elder is coming the
[4:51:07] brothers can display the video for us
[4:51:17] somewhere there.
[4:51:18] He can also be closer so that he can
[4:51:22] give me a song.
[4:51:50] So the video has started
[4:51:54] not yet.
[4:51:59] Okay. We are we are waiting for you
[4:52:01] brothers.
[4:52:44] A question.
[4:52:48] Whoever has ever
[4:52:52] prayed and said, "God, I want to see
[4:52:54] you."
[4:52:59] &gt;&gt; Stand up. Let me see.
[4:53:04] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[4:53:05] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[4:53:09] &gt;&gt; Who can tell me that
[4:53:14] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[4:53:15] &gt;&gt; What did he see? What he wanted to see?
[4:53:23] &gt;&gt; All right.
[4:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:53:33] &gt;&gt; Father, if that shall come to us before
[4:53:36] that time, [screaming] I be a natural
[4:53:37] death of this earth and separation here.
[4:53:40] May we enter chambers with a gown of
[4:53:42] faith wrapping the robe of Christ around
[4:53:44] you the Holy Ghost. Someday we got to
[4:53:47] come down. Father, I realize I got to
[4:53:49] walk that line, too. When I hear my
[4:53:52] thread,
[4:53:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go like a coward.
[4:53:58] &gt;&gt; I want to go like you lord.
[4:54:03] [music]
[4:54:11] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:54:26] [music]
[4:54:33] [music]
[4:54:41] [music]
[4:54:51] [music]
[4:54:54] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat.
[4:55:00] [music]
[4:55:15] Heat.
[4:55:56] And he being the groom,
[4:56:00] &gt;&gt; the bride has to come forth because it's
[4:56:03] part of him.
[4:56:04] &gt;&gt; And it can only be the manifestation of
[4:56:07] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[4:56:09] and the others that spoke of the bride.
[4:56:12] that can only manifest if it does
[4:56:14] something different from the groom. It
[4:56:16] isn't the bride
[4:56:18] because she's flesh of his flesh, bone
[4:56:21] of his bones, life of his life, power of
[4:56:24] his power.
[4:56:26] &gt;&gt; She is him.
[4:56:29] As man and woman are one, the woman
[4:56:32] taken from his side. She has taken his
[4:56:34] spirit, the baby, his spirit coming, the
[4:56:36] flesh from his side. Faith both senic
[4:56:38] and dynamic. The wife,
[4:56:42] the spirit of him, and the flesh of him
[4:56:46] and put it together and made mechanics
[4:56:48] and dimension

[4:57:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:57:15] [music]
[4:57:22] &gt;&gt; She is him.
[4:57:57] What is this?
[4:58:01] Yes, it's when you are in channels
[4:58:07] into another dimension
[4:58:12] where it is victory.
[4:58:15] There's no victory.
[4:58:21] &gt;&gt; While walking around,
[4:58:26] I
[4:58:28] to me I think of seeing things for the
[4:58:32] last time.
[4:58:37] &gt;&gt; You know the people that are blessed
[4:58:40] when their [music] time is over,
[4:58:44] they know it.

[5:18:57] coordinators
[5:19:01] from different sister churches
[5:19:05] [music]
[5:19:05] to assist the believers
[5:19:10] into the passes.
[5:19:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[5:19:13] &gt;&gt; It is very crucial
[5:19:18] that we do not waste time [music]
[5:19:22] and we avoid
[5:19:24] fellowship outside.
[5:19:30] When we leave the hall,
[5:19:33] we are requested [music] to go straight
[5:19:35] into the pastor.
[5:19:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:19:41] The pastor will guide us how we proceed
[5:19:44] to go out of the hall
[5:19:48] as it will be the pastor's first
[5:19:52] with the body of our pastor
[5:19:55] the family.
[5:19:57] But once the family and the elders and
[5:20:01] the pastors are out of the hall,
[5:20:06] then all believers can go straight to
[5:20:08] the buses.
[5:20:12] Amen.
[5:20:13] We also request
[5:20:16] young brothers and sisters,
[5:20:22] especially those that normally work with
[5:20:25] sister.
[5:20:30] [music]
[5:20:31] We request them to remain behind
[5:20:36] and not to go to the graveite.
[5:20:40] to help prepare the hall
[5:20:44] for [music] the VIPs for buying. So when
[5:20:49] we return for the great
[5:20:52] we are coming [music] back here.
[5:20:56] So all the round tables that will be in
[5:20:58] the hall
[5:21:01] are reserved for the family
[5:21:05] and the pastors [music]
[5:21:08] and their wives
[5:21:10] and all those that were given the tag as
[5:21:13] VIPs.
[5:21:18] Amen. Amen. On the left wing,
[5:21:24] we also have another place for the VIPs
[5:21:30] and we are going to use that.
[5:21:34] Amen.
[5:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And [music]
[5:21:38] for all the believers,
[5:21:42] &gt;&gt; we have mobile stations.
[5:21:48] So mobile stations they can serve from
[5:21:52] the any mobile station that will be
[5:21:54] outside
[5:21:59] and they can find a place to sit inside.
[5:22:04] Amen.
[5:22:06] Now [music] let me repeat this one.
[5:22:11] &gt;&gt; The buses outside
[5:22:15] &gt;&gt; have to leave first.
[5:22:19] Then once they leave the place,
[5:22:27] &gt;&gt; no other car must leave.
[5:22:31] &gt;&gt; The buses are blocking the road for the
[5:22:34] hes.
[5:22:40] So that's why we don't want you to waste
[5:22:42] time. just get into the buses
[5:22:46] so that they can move out of the yard.
[5:22:50] So the buses will be followed by the
[5:22:53] family car
[5:22:55] and the pastor's car.
[5:23:00] Then all other cars that want to go to
[5:23:03] the graveyard will fall.
[5:23:07] But we encourage everyone
[5:23:11] to find a spot in the bus.
[5:23:15] May the Lord richly bless you.
[5:23:18] The pastors requested that that video
[5:23:21] that was showing earlier on
[5:23:25] that that they play that
[5:23:29] while we invite Pastor David to come
[5:23:32] forth. [music]
[5:23:34] May the Lord richly bless you.
[5:23:37] I have two items here.
[5:23:41] &gt;&gt; Uh, one is a radio control
[5:23:46] &gt;&gt; and there is a mobile phone that was
[5:23:49] left in the hall [music] last night
[5:23:53] with a banking card inside.
[5:23:57] So, please you can come and collect
[5:23:59] them.
[5:24:01] God bless you.
[5:24:10] Shalom sense.
[5:24:11] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[5:24:15] &gt;&gt; As we uh are getting to now the move to
[5:24:20] the grave site.
[5:24:24] Uh
[5:24:26] we pass our gratitude
[5:24:31] &gt;&gt; and we thank everyone.
[5:24:34] who came to support the family
[5:24:38] and the church
[5:24:40] from the first day.
[5:24:43] This sad news came to us.
[5:24:47] Uh
[5:24:49] I would love to have uh music playing
[5:24:53] there.
[5:25:03] Um
[5:25:06] the way we will do it
[5:25:10] is that uh the pastor's
[5:25:18] &gt;&gt; okay. Uh
[5:25:23] I think the services will help us to
[5:25:26] come.
[5:25:29] uh so that we start [music] uh packing
[5:25:32] our flowers.
[5:25:36] &gt;&gt; So I will have pastor Madiva
[5:25:39] &gt;&gt; Pastor [music] Edgar Edgar
[5:25:42] &gt;&gt; Pastor Maka
[5:25:44] &gt;&gt; Pastor Freddy
[5:25:46] &gt;&gt; Pastor Fredd
[5:25:48] [music]
[5:25:49] they will join me by the casket there.
[5:25:59] Then
[5:26:01] as they will be standing there.
[5:26:07] So
[5:26:10] the coffin will go first
[5:26:13] with the pastors around
[5:26:17] taking it. Then uh the family will
[5:26:22] follow the closed family.
[5:26:26] &gt;&gt; The direct family
[5:26:40] and the children and the grandchildren
[5:26:43] will be behind them.
[5:26:48] pastors are going to follow them.
[5:26:53] &gt;&gt; But uh
[5:27:12] Okay. Uh while you saying that
[5:27:15] announcement, there's no problem. You
[5:27:17] can say that quickly. Uh then uh pastor
[5:27:21] Koko will come to pray for us for the
[5:27:25] the road to the grave site.
[5:27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[5:27:32] &gt;&gt; Um we are going to the Fontaine grave
[5:27:37] site
[5:27:40] &gt;&gt; and the root that we are using
[5:27:43] is N1 south.
[5:27:47] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to use the tall route
[5:27:50] gate.
[5:27:51] &gt;&gt; So, on the gate, we turn right
[5:27:56] until we find
[5:27:59] the N1 south.
[5:28:04] [music]
[5:28:04] Then we turn left
[5:28:07] and the sisters are asking
[5:28:12] brothers to remain
[5:28:19] to assist them
[5:28:21] in preparation of the hall.
[5:28:25] So not all the brothers will go to the
[5:28:27] graveside.
[5:28:31] Those that will remain can talk to
[5:28:33] brother outside.
[5:28:37] Amen. God bless you.
[5:28:49] Okay. Uh,
[5:28:57] okay. We will pastor, can you just wait
[5:29:00] for one minute there? Uh, I think
[5:29:03] everything has been done there. Uh the
[5:29:06] technical team are you all set? So you
[5:29:11] you can display that or it's already
[5:29:15] okay.
[5:29:28] Okay. The pastor is going to pray for us
[5:29:31] for the road. Then we will give
[5:29:34] instruction
[5:29:36] to start off from [music] here. Like I
[5:29:39] said,
[5:29:41] the it will be first the pastors with
[5:29:46] the coffee.
[5:29:48] So the box will be going out first
[5:29:53] then the direct [music] family
[5:29:57] will be behind them
[5:30:00] &gt;&gt; and the pastors.
[5:30:03] are going to follow.
[5:30:06] And we plead with you,
[5:30:08] please don't greet each other
[5:30:12] as we are marching out.
[5:30:15] Just go straight to your traffic
[5:30:19] for the sake of time
[5:30:21] and the traffic to be uh smooth
[5:30:27] this moment
[5:30:30] with so much respect
[5:30:33] and reverence.
[5:30:36] &gt;&gt; May God bless you our pastor.
[5:30:40] Let's pray. [music]
[5:30:42] Most heavenly father,
[5:30:46] thank you for this message of the hour.
[5:30:50] Lord,

[5:32:13] We know that he teach us that we are in
[5:32:17] a negative form but there is a positive
[5:32:21] somewhere.

[5:32:26] when he moved here in this body,
[5:32:30] he went straight to that ball of light.
[5:32:35] He was there [music]
