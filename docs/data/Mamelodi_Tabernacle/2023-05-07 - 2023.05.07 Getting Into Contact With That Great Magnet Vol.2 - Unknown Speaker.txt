Description:
Title: Getting Into Contact With That Great Magnet Vol.2

Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 07-05-2023 at Khayelitsha in Cape Town South Africa

The purpose of this sermon   was to encourage the audience to be in contact with the great magnet.

Heb 7: 11 - 26.   Eph 1:4

For God to keep us he had to make us in himself.

Hebrews says for this highpriest became us and Genesis says let us make man in our image, because God couldn’t think of something else besides himself.

The Devine nature that we have is to be like him.

Quote: 57-0908M -  Hebrews, Chapter Five And Six #1 God made Angels, but God made man. And what God does is off of God, which is as Eternal as God is. And man is just as Eternal as his Creator, because he was made from Eternity.

with us some thousands of kilometers away naturally but spiritually he is with us here and some others you know they usually great amen so today brother let's read from verse 11 to 26. we will be looking idea melchized priesthood all right and we've seen yesterday how when he met Abraham he was melchized he came from heaven and met Abraham and he came as a high priest now furthermore Hebrews chapter seven weeks of the priesthood [Applause] after the order of melchized and you know the also the Bible [Applause] heavenly father again we come to thee knowing that Lord God away we have come here with nothing in our hands but the father we hear knowing that we will leave this place filled with the power of God and the word that created us in the beginning father we are so glad we are so glad that we are not even a creation but we were there before there was any creation and father we know the part that was created and the part that was in Christ and was not created father we are so thankful that we open our hearts now for the word to come again and then we know the real real preacher is the Lord Jesus Christ and we are living in the days where the angel of the Lord they stood up and said Christ is the mystery of God revealed and that's why we are here Lord God bless our brothers bless the sisters heal the sick Lord as it's your duty you promised us that you will heal us you will speak to us and this morning we are so thankful that we are not alone in this place but you are with us here father as I pray for the opening of the word this morning and inviting you father as our preacher this morning in Jesus Christ's name I believe we will leave this place a blessed people singing songs of Zion in Jesus Christ name amen amen Hebrews chapter 7 from verse 11 to 26 if therefore Perfection whereby the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek and not be called after the order of Aaron for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar for it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Judah of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of Melchizedek there arrives at another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life for he testified thou are a priest Forever After the order of melchized for there is verily a disanaling of The Commandments going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God and in as much as not without an oath he was made priest for those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that said unto him the Lord swear and will not repent and thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek by so much was Jesus made a shorty of a better Testament and they truly were many pleased because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continues ever have an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such an high priest became us who is Holy harmless undefiled separate from Sinners and made higher than the heavens amen you may be seated God bless him together pardon me brother pardon me okay God bless you brothers and sisters and everybody [Music] amen I believe we all know who is amen amen who met Abraham the king of and he is our King we know and this morning we want to thank him for being with us here sorry we exchanging things and things okay it's fine it's fine all right now we want to look and because you know brother Branham says were open how much you enough and he says then he is a king you know he met Abraham and later he met Brothers and he as you know I started last week or their third week there was this him I mean Abraham Abraham then he again said that we have another hymn because amen and I was looking into those things now we've brought up you know we he has also met Melchizedek melchized [Music] but when he met a citizen then he was called Melchizedek whatever because the king of Salem but he is we no longer hear about milk because he became Jesus so [Music] [Applause] [Music] but when he meets Abraham is a citizen now the king needs a citizen all right now what about these last days as you see we said yesterday and I would love to ask to address the bride of Christ not not a message because we have so many message but we need to come as the bride the bread of Christ addressed by Melchizedek um [Applause] you know that's where we are going again and next time we'll come there are those who will come out afterwards they come through the tribulation period but greater you know in the tribulation period you have the 144 000 those are Jews and you also have the sleeping Vision there [Music] come through the tribulation [Applause] [Applause] [Music] they appear there as [Applause] amen and we look at the bride appears there as the Queens let's look at this let's look at this for such a high priest became a swaba City amen amen maybe we are not thankful I don't know but if the word tells me that such a high priest when he met Abraham I met Abraham as the high priest he is and [Applause] we will have their cities next week will bring all those things oh all right and all the signs are and [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] but [Music] blessed is the bread of Christ because that is her time and the prophet says she will have the trust and the Lord and he says even Death Shall never touch it because she's on the runway waiting for them to be taken up amen so we thank God for that I want to look into this and [Applause] you know this high priest became US city all right amen then I'm I mentioned it again that in Genesis weaknesses God said let foreign this priest this high priest I don't know if you are listening he became a city amen is that so [Applause] you know even the Bible says Paul said we are talking these things today perfectly foreign [Music] [Applause] says we are perfect that means we have eternal life because there's only one Perfection that's God all right amen now the Bible tells us that we were chosen him oh yeah let us now start from the inside before we were chosen in him where do you find that scripture before palmy the foundation of the world [Applause] for God to choose me but I worship this God who has chosen me in him all right amen Amen brother let's find it there while I'm reading something here is that efficiency Ephesians chapter 1 from verse 4 yeah just just take that scripture it says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world [Applause] before this because before before the foundation of the world we were already that's why in London I I I I don't believe that Satan can overcome a person who has chosen before he existed um let me repeat again I don't believe that Satan who Satan can overcome a person who was chosen before he Satan existed [Applause] amen amen I believe that the winner is the one who has chosen before the foundation of the world [Applause] now and foreign chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world okay are you listen closely chosen up in yesterday it doesn't choose it it doesn't say chosen up by him it is and we became him all right amen because already you go back you'll find yourself in him before he created anything we were in him watching and that's why now you know when he was talking to those he has known that is first John what does what it says first John chapter one that which was from the beginning which we have had which we have seen with our eyes right now that which was from the beginning now God has got no beginning and we were trying to do to say this yes in the beginning was the word and God has no beginning that's why it continues to say and they read was with God amen amen was God who okay now like you are coming through the stages foreign man has lost a sight of his image there is that saying the sight of His Image because we were made in his he has chosen us according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love driving all day just before the foundation before he started any other thing I will say I you also say I I was already chosen dance before there was Satan before they was sin I was chosen before there was divisions I was chosen before they was falling away amen amen so it is impossible for you to fall off because you were chosen look at you before palmy before they were even divisions or a church politics or church divisions you were already and the Bible says teacher by building ties in Abraham so they paid tithesis okay amen um I I will read this part [Applause] what would a man that is Page 310 of this Hebrew Book what would a man uh take Tides foreign [Music] [Applause] in Abraham [Music] when he was in the ruins of Abraham four generations before he ever come to Earth he was paying tithesis I want us to go inside a person who is paying times it is because he paid the tires [Applause] [Applause] [Music] you that can't believe is true um it brings you to where brother Branham puts it this way when Abraham met Melchizedek he paid tithesis to Melchizedek um [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign foreign [Applause] we are not just talking about gifts and so forth against people talking about his himself you know what we need today not much of gifts and so forth what we need is himself that's why he also what he needs with us that's why he said let us make men in our image all right in order for him to keep us he made us in himself because if God can keep himself if God is Holy We Are Holy amen amen if God cannot fall we can't yeah [Applause] we are chosen foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Fallen wow Heaven wow he has lost the title but those who are with who who were behind the Michael our person are even now behind my account you know a person who would live they say somebody has fallen away now and if you say what happened they come with some excuses it is because of this not if he's a Son of God I'll tell you those who have won the battle Italy they they will continue to win the best those who were behind my car and they won the battle against Satan and his angels they will continue to win them because as brother Brennan puts it the first thing in heaven was a Battlefield [Applause] and Michael Michael Lucifer Out of Heaven yes are you with me and now the battle from Heaven became human battles [Music] then he said now secondly was now in the mind we started here on Earth in the battle called the battle of Armageddon will be fought by the very same people who have fought in heaven [Applause] uh I come to this page this is a wallpaper where brother Branham tells me here you listen from this this high priest City okay now it takes me back to where he said let us make men in our way too all right I mean is there such a man in the image of God all right let us make men my friends now let's go let's get out of the World Systems you find living churches are fighting one another in all directions not in Christ [Applause] is not in the world now in Christ we don't have divisions you can division you can have divisions in the world we don't have divisions in Christ amen amen Christ is not divided the bread of Christ is not divided I met a sister here I was at my in-laws one time now she said to me coming from a certain denomination she said to me you too the so-called message Believers so you are separated amen I said let me I beg your pardon he said you too you are separated I know of one group they don't go hand in hand with another group there I said we are talking about churches but I'm talking to you about the bride of Christ the brother of Christ is not in tatters we have only one Christ um so I said that now she tells me that I used to go around with a certain Pastor I love the Lord and revivals but when this and this and this happened then I lost hope even since that time I've never set my food in a church I said okay you are telling me you used to work with us also go around with us also now I'm telling you about Christ that's the difference I mean have you ever walked with Christ now you must start to work with Christ now you'll find that that you have experience you must work with Christ freeze through talk with him walk with him and you'll see the difference ah man [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] um from let us make men in our image I'm trying to uh say look at something here this message is true let's start from here and then chapter 15 15. now I start here now my Prophet tells me that God gave himself to this song again okay no let us try to look so much longer inside now we we took because it says eating it was the father and out of their father came forth the logos out of the logos you know starting from the inside out of the father came forth the logos out of the logos came forth the men now now the logos men the one who was in the if you say [Applause] that's why the Bible says he that is born of God [Applause] he gave birth now that which is born of God cannot sin because it is like God if all of us were born of God we would have peace love long suffering Temperance because being born of God you take the nature of God a child that is born of God has taken the nature of God it's not right we're born of God we will be in harmony we would love one another they would know they would never come divisions we will be like God we will be like our father amen amen that's why Redemption has to it took blood the blood of God the blood of the family man you know that's why called the King's Men redeemers [Applause] what the word King stands foreign amen amen King's Men Redeemer um but a family man the family man all right before I continue if we were if we are born of God we would never fight one another we would never hate one another would never say bad things about one another status makes us to be like God we come with the nature of God okay let us make men in our God was so careful let us make men in our foreign [Applause] which was before there was even an atom atom he gave himself okay I mean hey I don't know how to put it against but I think you understand what I'm saying is okay became a city now the last thing I'm going to read is let us make men in our welcome foreign [Applause] [Music] to restore foreign [Applause] all right four this high priest became us I don't know I'll be leaving this place going home that say still saying this high priest City [Applause] he became me that's why my the the the the the nature the divine nature that we have it's nice to be like him that is the divine nature of course we know as a human being you cannot beat your nature but as a child of God to have a divine nature which is of god you don't love somebody because he has given you some money I love him because you are loved if you read in the Bible God didn't say I have a way he said I am the way he never said I have the truth I am there the truth now just like you don't just say I'm a Christian you should be crushed like to be a Christian Christian but now that's why you know the bride of Christ is his wife if even an ordinary man of course if he is a Christian Christian we would love to marry a Christian wife I mean if he is a Christian he would not go against his own divine nature because his divine nature to serve God all right [Music] who's out for a wife it will be a Divine wife amen [Music] okay now I read this page 175 paper 175 I'm going to quote from this book here before I close a 175 175. I will read this part God bless you um Melchizedek the great priests he had no beginning [Music] if I'm called to serve I will save this one the one we thought beginning without end without father without mother why we serve why we are he is our key it is because he came to Abraham because the few funny of Abraham um had no father no mother no beginning and we have read that yesterday not magnetized because inside of Abraham was the same nature [Applause] there is another man in Abraham had no father no no no beginning foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] um we were made in the image of God foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] okay now if you are not of Christ they say you are of the world you're not Elder gun last I was trying to talk about the fourth dimension the United States because brother Branham says I believe I'm talking to the message believers he says Ooty he says you know talking about the fourth Dimensions he said inside of the room here you'll see some television pictures like television pictures you know television pictures even if you want to see yourself you can see yourself we are born away now Badoo but to me I don't like I don't want to

all in in this world the world is old woman oh is there something you can enjoy in this world amen amen I can't even enjoy ing television or seeing myself I just want to see him because I was made in his way image amen you know if I were to you were told that you were making the image of Jesus Christ you would want to see him the rest of your life because that is your your image brother Brandon says you know in creation when God was creating and you know I've read this many a times then he arrived at amen foreign [Applause] did you hear me reading that many times when he was creating when he arrived at the man he says what he could see in that man that it looked like him then he stopped yourself now you'll stop at something resembling you now we are walking down the streets won't you stop alsuma you will stop now in this cycle that's why he was coming through the seals drama [Applause] [Applause] amen when he came to day one something that looked like him he stopped where am I is that right when he was creating doing his rounds then he came and stopped and said let us make men in our too amen amen and that's all in his rounds he stops at his own image that's why he says therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect all right now [Music] foreign [Applause] [Applause] when he was supposed and people were looking that at him that now he is opening the seventh now then he stopped [Applause] [Music] you go back we remember coming doing his rounds but when he arrived at the main life he came to him he stopped we are a man he opened the seals when he arrived at the

Holy Ghost came some people still remain waiting for that promise he said he will send who tells out to men because [Applause] [Music] God cannot send the Holy Ghost to the people who do not know the holy ghosts [Applause] when it came to Peter then he stood up and said he greeted the people say these people are not drunk he recognized he will send it to a person the people who would recognize it
