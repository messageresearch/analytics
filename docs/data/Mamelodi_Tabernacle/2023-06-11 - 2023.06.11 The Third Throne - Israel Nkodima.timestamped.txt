[2:05:58] our heavenly father
[2:06:03] our gracious Lord
[2:06:04] [Music]
[2:06:09] is the final call Lord
[2:06:10] [Music]
[2:06:15] It's the final call
[2:06:21] this is your weight
[2:06:27] that you said the father
[2:06:31] when you are in eternity
[2:06:36] you send your weight first Lord
[2:06:40] I live and set in the beginning there
[2:06:43] was a wait and the way it was with God
[2:06:45] and the weight was gone
[2:06:51] that same way
[2:06:54] it is the way the father
[2:06:57] which stood with us until it is time
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:05] sales were open for
[2:07:08] foreign
[2:07:10] everyone to perfection
[2:07:12] [Music]
[2:07:15] one day the Pastor said
[2:07:19] people were asking Moses
[2:07:21] to grant them the letter of divorce
[2:07:26] but Jesus said it was not so even from
[2:07:29] the beginning
[2:07:29] [Music]
[2:07:32] because now where we are father
[2:07:35] is where everything it has been restored
[2:07:39] it is the time of perfection
[2:07:43] it is the time of the spirit of God
[2:07:47] it is the time father where you knock in
[2:07:50] the heart of individual
[2:07:52] it is normal the time of churches
[2:07:56] it's normally the time of Youth Services
[2:07:58] and men's services and so forth
[2:08:03] but father it is the time where you
[2:08:06] knock in the heart of individual
[2:08:08] [Music]
[2:08:10] they are here father they are standing
[2:08:12] in the Pulpit
[2:08:13] they are coming from all over from
[2:08:16] different places
[2:08:19] father they are saying Lord they are
[2:08:21] coming in
[2:08:24] gracious Heavenly Father we pray this
[2:08:27] day that the Lord whosoever is here
[2:08:32] accepting the Lord as his or her
[2:08:35] personal savior
[2:08:39] if they are some they are not yet being
[2:08:42] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:08:44] Christ
[2:08:47] there must not leave father let them be
[2:08:49] baptized now
[2:08:52] because father we are in the hour
[2:08:56] where Lord Jesus is coming
[2:08:58] [Music]
[2:09:00] the pastor was talking about the shaking
[2:09:03] of Earth and earthquakes and everything
[2:09:07] this morning Father at about half past
[2:09:10] two to three
[2:09:12] there was a shake that was happening
[2:09:15] Lord
[2:09:18] I'm talking about the shake that happens
[2:09:20] here in joburg
[2:09:22] this morning Lord
[2:09:25] some of their houses are cracked
[2:09:28] some father they thought that it is the
[2:09:31] rapture
[2:09:32] but the father we know that Lord the
[2:09:35] Rapture is not about
[2:09:37] that shaking but it was a sign
[2:09:41] that the Father the Rapture is at hand
[2:09:46] thank you Heavenly Father for using
[2:09:49] the pastor in such a way
[2:09:52] you are bringing exactly the weight
[2:09:54] which is right for the pride
[2:09:58] because father they need to be ready to
[2:10:00] come in
[2:10:02] we pray each and every soul which they
[2:10:05] are here
[2:10:06] those who are taking decisions
[2:10:09] that's my father they want to be to that
[2:10:11] constellation
[2:10:13] we pray for each and everyone
[2:10:16] that my father

[2:10:29] it was the right word for this time O
[2:10:32] Lord
[2:10:33] it was the right way father that we have
[2:10:35] brought
[2:10:36] when you are talking further about the
