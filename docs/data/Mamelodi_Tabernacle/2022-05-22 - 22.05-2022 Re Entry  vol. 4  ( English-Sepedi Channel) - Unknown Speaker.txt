be here cavalier tabi kamoka okay i don't know whether i should talk about it or not you know wherever we go marian gonna satan also comes saturnally okay right even now naturally if it were possible we could just name them all right amen but leave everything for i have overcome the world [Music] god bless you and those who are and you're encouraged god bless you yeah we are so thankful we we have two parts of the message this morning we'll end up with a wedding and if those who can be able to take it to to the end then they will end up with just to bless the rings for our brother and sister and because they their wedding was traditional so they just want us to bless their rings but foreign is just to bless their rings okay now we will again read to read the word of god as we all believe as our pastor has already said it that we are in the last days and the signs are there your honor amen amen did you hear the voice of the seventh angel messenger liquidly there's so many voices in this world but there is a voice a failure voice he said behold i will send you elijah the prophet and we are watching the signs we were we have received from the 7th angel messenger watch russia king of the north russia is it not happening ideally it is happening and some some other prophecies okay let's open our bibles arena and uh i i won't be long i i promise yeah uh what god has in store for us this morning will be sufficient too kid take us up amen amen because it speaks of the mechanics and the dynamics dynamics all right amen now we're looking at the dynamics that will take you need dynamics to be taken up in a twinkling of an eye now that the dynamics is not to play the whole day but it's to take the word of god that he has promised embargo has been preached amen to those who are predestinated okay let's get ours the same scriptures we have read yesterday okay jessaya 55 verse 11. so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to i send me i see uh [Music] [Music] oh in the name of jesus amen amen god bless you you may take your sins amen amen let me make aware of this as you are the church of the of the lord i think three weeks back we had a service somewhere when was it when we were at the what's the place captain park is it is we expect two weeks back now the service was on saturday and sunday saturday sunday before we we just i won't be long i promise and then you'll see that yeah i mean this saturday i was not in for the saturday service usually [Music] we realized that there were five or six people the agents of the devil satan who we do not fear satan or some children because he has fallen from heaven after he started an opposition party there camera opposition michael drove him down with his sword you know this is the battle we're talking about jolly king johannes the battle of armageddon that started in heaven 82 million and it's still raging it started in the form of these angels in heaven [Music] to human mind now it's been raging on like that usually end up in the form of the garden of eden yes now every time you see some conflicts [Music] don't you fear or don't you worry our way foreign [Music] yeah this morning i just want us to look at this because it's the time for our return again inaudible yes sir so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to i sent it all right this word shall return now i am looking at the returning word of god which word was he talking about in july the way that will return back to him again because this word was in him and he decided to speak you are god's word in a physical form the child of god is there is that word that was sent killing julia rometro to start talking working preaching and singing that is the word of god i giving the revelations to that word i in love the word when it comes to this original man in a man in a human body we call it a revelation live because it's not a way that can be uttered by human beings it is the word of god killing julia mudimu send it to the word of god when the word of god meets with the word he has sent le corpora but what oh okay amen so we we are going to take this form from here now i repeat can we say later eden was the headquarters of god eden headquarters the garden of eden gardenia okay it is here you you find it here in the book of genesis if i like [Music] yeah i've got an old bible here just read it my brother and what happened genesis chapter 2 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden okay verse 7 and the lord god formed men of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul amen because this man the bible says there was no man to till the ground [Music] so god took that adam to put and put him into a body made of the dust color so that for the man to be able to remote the ground he put him in a body of made of the ground adam was not this body adama adam was put into that body [Music] one me and verse eight and the god and god planted a garden well marina is the watching eden eden took out amen amen because eden is a country as i'm told here gauri i don't believe there's a garden that that can much match that garden don't worry we are going back if there is something that we have missed back there if you analysis don't worry we are still going we have bypassed our theophanies adam but we were born through the permissive will of god after sin has entered originally we were not born not like it was nothing you see that facing canceling your way look out [Music] again because let me go back there again i was trying to bring you to something when i was told that a child is being [Music] attacked then i asked one she's the queen yeah we have met them you know the queens queen of indian ocean i expected this queen to be at that service but when i realized she's not there regular moreover i asked her where are you i said not my weight but she said i am under arch i said with whom she said with my daughter and i knew that they were there godzilla to help those who were at the service at tuition the place kempton park park but then we we prayed to break the link [Music] [Music] amen amen and if you are talking about the son of god you are not just talking about a mere man an ordinary person munnar there's some people working in this world without any people but a son of god but a doctor of god is a person with a people unalienable and the lord god planted a garden east what in eden that's why the gate is called the east east gate i was reading many things about the man who has lost his sight because god made you cowardice you know what is healing after all usually amen amen can you answer me healing is to restore something the word lin for restoration that is in you didn't you know when all right let me put it this way my hand can't work it's like a dead oh it is working coming it happened several times not once he directly runs yesterday because what i believe is [Music] because you believe our domain that has the power killing troops not oil not water only me are you there hallelujah now i want you to understand something now i'm ready you like that that's how originally it was not like it is now wrong even people could could be healed by the shadow of peter actually they are healed by god for this i came but because somebody believed that this man peter is a servant of god and some of them took the towels off paul van gaal because preaching wipe himself like that there was a tower i shared it with you got healed but he don't know who made my phone i mean that healing is something of that nature now you look at this i'm going to talk for a few minutes the god will allow me to do semiconductors the people that are going back to abuela healing is also that thing usually eternally attending to your health well more healthy all these things check out the healing position [Music] we are talking about it going back because in the beginning [Music] [Applause] even to be taken in the rapture it takes the [Music] that will cause you in the twinkling of an eye to take off is [Music] some of these things last time i think i don't know but everything now usually come on restoration is almost in every country [Music] every human being is my brother is my sister amen so god hasn't given me that the spirit of xenophobia he has given when we reach when we reach the beyond there will there be any uh that phobia in the new jerusalem israel we are one because the blood is of christ it's not even human blood assembly amount the blood of christ to be another type of blood they they don't know the blood of christ sure right now let me finish this and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the men whom he had formed morena he gave him a form of all right if i can take that form of you then you remain a theophany mainly one over them you know the bible says god is there can you see a spirit because it started as the mind of god all right and the mind of god among us and we saw his glory amen amen how god changed into this form this form this form like that and out of the grow the ground god all right let me read it let me read out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the site and good for food and the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil and did you know that the people now living know that those two trees were humans so god comes in parables and sometimes you know he's singing you are not a snake but the serpent separated me amen it is not a snake i still know if was not deceived by a snake ever as a foreigner can you can you believe a doctrine that says it was deceived by a snake in november a girl is deceived by a boy it's a harley it's a all right now when things were were like this like men in the he allowed the serpent to come and interpret that to him the man the man allowed the subject the woman there if allowed the serpent to come out and deceived him because the serpent came in interpreted to head a tree of knowledge don't eat from this because the day you eat you'll be like okay they ate from the forbidden fruit of the of the garden [Music] they went out through the east gate yeah have you seen it in your bible [Music] yes because i i'm trying to finish up here at the gate he drove you know you know the [Music] you know they start to change perfect or amen i mean they no longer need prayers and so forth you get what i mean especially once they can touch that tree and grace came in the form of christ [Music] [Applause] verse 24 right so he drove out the men and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned everywhere to keep the way of the tree of life amen some yes [Music] i hated the former i don't know how you say it the the former king he was addressing his subjects he was addressing history where christianity is to rule us back again a substitute instead of adam cherubim amen amen the tree of life is god that was that what there was to god the the tree of life to guard the way of that tree of life about this way when man is trying to return to ali has made this way a way in the highway after he drove him out immediately made a way for him to return that's why jesus says i am the way i am you don't have your own way however i so i don't have it i mean if i want to walk that way i cannot go to my life in my heart if i want to we read the book of john 15 verse five [Applause] if jesus says nothing it means nothing they're just so [Applause] amen these two boys they came to they were twins even in lima farts yes and they came here to this garden [Music] that's why when they were looking for their way back they made some sacrifice cane able make a sacrifice what do the boys trying to do they were trying to go big baby now to to go back they built some altars in asking god for forgiveness wanting to go back says by faith he made that kind of a sacrifice yeah i've done it you were saying to god like take it or leave it now then lastly lastly listen now that's when you see is [Applause] come to a [Applause] you need to find a place of worship [Music] this is the place where god will meet men in through the blood without the blood there is no redemption his fruits and vegetables could not bring him can bring redemption when we were sinners never did it's a terrible thing to reject him you know these people in were fighting there and they were they they they were defeated yes they were subject to become human bili but a witch is a woman can be here well dressed in agave she greets one another but inside of her a fella it's not christ i see christ it's a demon king almost now these demons are fallen beings they come to the people [Music] people someday be rich people they are also human amen amen but instead of receiving the holy ghost [Applause] that's episode i know these ones they may promise a big house of money but they should be challenged yes they will get that money hey what is so he thought a way to get rid of this because the bible he believes of the evil one if anyone you move now if he is of the evidence he can never i can see a change worker listen let me run it to the finish line when out the bible later said cain went out of the bible the presence of the lord born that is the altar the altar of god the first [Music] you are enjoying their thomas for the moment on even today all right i mean in heaven it was in that form those angels day and night we
