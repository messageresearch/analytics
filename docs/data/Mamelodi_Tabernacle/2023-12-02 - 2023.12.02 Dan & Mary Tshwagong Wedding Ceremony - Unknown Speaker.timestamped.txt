[1:21:53] uh
[1:21:54] book Abraham was
[1:21:56] old and well strien in
[1:22:00] age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in
[1:22:04] all
[1:22:07] things now you should know that we are
[1:22:10] the Seed of
[1:22:13] Abraham the Bible says Christ
[1:22:17] also is the Seed of
[1:22:20] Abraham now
[1:22:23] uh it started
[1:22:25] there from the seed
[1:22:30] family right
[1:22:33] amen what do you
[1:22:37] expect if a wedding
[1:22:40] started from the house of
[1:22:47] Abraham now it
[1:22:49] says and Abraham Abraham said unto his
[1:22:55] Elder servant of his
[1:23:00] house the
[1:23:03] eldest which we have brother
[1:23:06] bam as the
[1:23:08] eldest the seventh
[1:23:11] one the eldest in the
[1:23:17] house if you look at the
[1:23:20] pyramid the house we see the
[1:23:25] eldest being brother
[1:23:29] BR okay amen now it was
[1:23:34] because for God to get his
[1:23:38] bride he needed the elest in the
[1:23:45] house to bring the
[1:23:48] bright now and said Abraham said said
[1:23:53] unto his eldest servant of his
[1:23:59] house the house of
[1:24:02] Abraham yeah and if you look for the
[1:24:05] third pool you'll find it in the in this
[1:24:11] house I have found it in this
[1:24:14] house amen amen uh that ruled over all
[1:24:19] that he
[1:24:21] had
[1:24:23] he put I
[1:24:26] pray thy hand under my
[1:24:30] thigh and I will make you
[1:24:34] s by the Lord the god of
[1:24:38] Heaven the the god of the
[1:24:42] earth that thou shall not take a wife
[1:24:45] unto my
[1:24:47] son of the daughters of the
[1:24:51] Canaanites
[1:24:54] among whom I
[1:24:56] dwell but thou sh go unto my
[1:25:04] country amen
[1:25:06] amen thou shall not take a
[1:25:12] wife not meaning
[1:25:15] that
[1:25:16] H the messenger here was
[1:25:20] supposed to take
[1:25:24] to take is that it's something that is
[1:25:28] already been
[1:25:33] prepared for to be
[1:25:37] taken amen
[1:25:39] amen what brother B
[1:25:43] says God matched
[1:25:46] them
[1:25:51] them as we know what the Bible
[1:25:56] says that the
[1:25:59] woman was created for the
[1:26:06] man the
[1:26:08] wife the woman was
[1:26:12] created for the
[1:26:16] man
[1:26:19] especially when she was created
[1:26:24] already she was created for
[1:26:28] somebody amen that's why Abraham
[1:26:33] said go and
[1:26:38] take he never said go and
[1:26:43] propose because she is already
[1:26:48] there planed
[1:26:51] already because Abraham
[1:26:54] Abraham uh I mean Isaac is from the
[1:26:59] Royal
[1:27:01] seed from the Royal
[1:27:04] house so be careful if you go to take a
[1:27:11] wife
[1:27:12] for
[1:27:14] Isaac you must make
[1:27:17] sure this messenger the eldest in the
[1:27:21] house
[1:27:23] all
[1:27:24] right take
[1:27:26] her she's there already

[1:27:33] many
[1:27:35] things go and
[1:27:39] take
[1:27:41] and the messenger did
[1:27:44] that when they arrive in the evening
[1:27:50] time that was in the evening time
[1:27:54] and stood there by the
[1:27:57] well now even in
[1:28:00] time that's when
[1:28:03] women come to for to collect to draw
[1:28:09] water that this

[1:30:13] said give me
[1:30:15] water she said for the C as well she
[1:30:20] started to say
[1:30:24] and it pleased the messenger so
[1:30:27] much that it was
[1:30:30] happening that she was
[1:30:33] prepared even
[1:30:36] before amen

[1:31:04] evening
[1:31:05] okay and you will realize
[1:31:08] that when he saw she saw

[1:32:04] C she didn't know Isaac
[1:32:12] physically but she knew
[1:32:14] him through the spoken we amen spoken
[1:32:20] we no can match things like
[1:32:28] God amen amen
[1:32:31] now
[1:32:33] immediately and the Bible says it was in
[1:32:39] the from the evening
[1:32:42] there the
[1:32:45] [Music]
[1:32:47] evening then she got off
[1:32:52] they came
[1:32:53] in as I said the other
[1:32:58] time the bride of
[1:33:01] Christ I think now she's not on a
[1:33:06] com
[1:33:11] back when the messenger
[1:33:13] said say is this the
[1:33:18] time and they said Christ the mystery of
[1:33:23] God
[1:33:27] revealed
[1:33:29] and the bride of Christ
[1:33:33] today amen she's no longer only
[1:33:40] come because the messenger has pointed
[1:33:45] out says is this the
[1:33:49] time all right amen
[1:33:55] and you
[1:33:57] know some people are still remaining on
[1:34:07] Camel that's when you haven't seen
[1:34:11] him but if you have seen him
[1:34:15] coming you are no longer on the
[1:34:20] B
[1:34:22] amen okay amen
[1:34:28] and is and
[1:34:32] Rebecca they didn't have cell
[1:34:38] phones they didn't know each
[1:34:42] other
[1:34:45] fa they only received the
[1:34:50] message because Christ has already
[1:34:57] prepared and it is is sort of type of a
[1:35:03] message that will bring them
[1:35:09] together
[1:35:15] there the message only reach
[1:35:18] Rebecca about somebody
[1:35:22] she has never
[1:35:25] seen
[1:35:27] facially she
[1:35:29] only
[1:35:32] know the part of that
[1:35:36] man supposed to be her
[1:35:40] husband through the spoken
[1:35:45] Worden he was told about
[1:35:48] Isaac if one would have said
[1:35:52] do you know
[1:35:56] this I that
[1:36:07] ISAC the theop of this man Isaac had to
[1:36:12] Feit the theop of
[1:36:15] this so before they meet in
[1:36:20] flesh
[1:36:22] oh she must meet with him first
[1:36:28] amen before we meet the
[1:36:31] Lord we must meet with him
[1:36:36] first
[1:36:38] through that's why the word
[1:36:42] says H everything that was
[1:36:48] created has an has an in
[1:36:53] that's my
[1:36:55] Prophet not
[1:36:57] on and I said
[1:36:59] oh everything that was
[1:37:03] created has an
[1:37:06] end because the Bible
[1:37:10] says
[1:37:12] Genesis do you say Genesis or Genesis or
[1:37:15] Genesis who it says Amen in the
[1:37:20] beginning
[1:37:21] God
[1:37:23] created heaven and earth that is
[1:37:28] creation then afterwards he said Heaven

[1:53:11] God and leave God to have his
[1:53:15] way this world will be a better
[1:53:18] place
[1:53:20] why things
[1:53:25] mix it is because we
[1:53:28] refusing we are trying to do it
[1:53:31] ourselves nothing can
[1:53:33] be perfect
[1:53:39] perfect that is done by
[1:53:42] men I can prove to you

[1:54:47] the circumstances I'm for you can't
[1:54:50] preach to

[1:54:58] like who is this
[1:55:01] woman when the Lord
[1:55:09] arrive that was Mary
[1:55:13] and when the Lord arrived Mara started
[1:55:17] to preach

[1:58:33] feral have you ever seen
[1:58:36] Resurrection
[1:58:37] attending a
[1:58:43] funeral

[1:59:31] own bones and
[1:59:34] body and they were
[1:59:37] there some rolling and crying and so
[1:59:42] forth then when he arrived there he
[1:59:46] brought Lazarus to
[1:59:53] body I won't say take it or leave
