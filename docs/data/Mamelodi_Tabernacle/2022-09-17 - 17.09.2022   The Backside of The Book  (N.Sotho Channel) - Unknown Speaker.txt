foreign [Music] [Applause] as I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ just from another wonderful service God has blessed us with this evening service amen now I'm so glad to have her [Music] pasta in our midst amen amen we are and also our brothers all of you I'm glad to have you and all of you here amen you remember last week I said something and the week before that I I was abroad so a pastor was driving me around now I said to the pastor where is pasta so and so [Music] because I know how the situation was before now this time he said to me why one is there the Lord has blessed him just as the same as the Lord has blessed me here [Music] and I said pastor my it's a wonderful thing that you have said the Lord has blessed him and God is keeping on blessing him just the same as he is blessing us here [Music] it's a good thing amen so because this is the even in time no uh at first when we were talking at home I I was thinking of having the service we had before this one and skipped through there to add tomorrow service the Lord willing but when I saw that and things were going this other way [Music] then I surrendered okay you know when they were clinging to extend Brandon Tabernacle brother brand name was against it at first and so now when he saw that the majority ruled amen are amazing all right now I will have some just a short spiritual uh someone here to open their way for us for a service tomorrow the Lord willing you know these days we share we fear to say tomorrow because the Rapture is so close the Lord really commission is now uh we know that everybody here is a child of God amen amen and that's all we're going to open the scripture pertaining to this time [Music] but they actually opening up the service for both now and tomorrow the Lord willing foreign somebody uh that will be a Genesis 14. Verse 18 to 20 18 20. it's a well-known scripture okay Genesis 14 18 to 20. and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand and he gave him tight of all amen amen okay um foreign foreign Augusta see holla for a prayer after reading the word foreign faster yes foreign [Music] [Music] found out like I'm impressed movie 2018 [Music] foreign okay and you know Timber song and you know I was reading this uh the message Malaysia I will just give out to you what we're going to speak about because of which this evening is just part of it the scriptures concerning that yeah we want to look at the the back side of the book today I'll give you some of the scriptures because there's a big a book written within and on the back side sealed amen amen now I'm also looking at the water Branham said of the book of the revelation when he said something in this nature the Revelation Genesis Genesis tells the beginning the beginning revelation I was going to happen amen amen so that's why our theme because we're going to look into the back side [Music] because this is now the end time and as you know that okay if we are going back we realize that uh back there you know brother says foreign I'm talking to the people that are familiar with this books and the scriptures all right amen says worry I I can read it tomorrow the people who were not foreign cannot see it by born amen amen because now the Revelation here you know as I was looking at the book here only I don't have it you will read those I don't have here will read tomorrow he said the revelation of the Seven Seals is actually to reveal what was there what was it amen amen and like we take the scripture again and then first John chapter 3. just let us take this one again there Epistle of John chapter one yes that which we have seen and had declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us all right that which we have seen I repeat I've been reading it time and again example and they have seen declare we unto you [Music] amen amen and then they declare unto you declare we unto you that he also may have fellowship with us so you also may have fellowship with us okay I mean now before I write I just read some a few things here the the prophet reads uh this way Satan will attack the Book of Genesis now but I want to come to this place where he says this book is made for a certain class of people reality every time God would bring a message that's for a certain class okay received by a certain class is that right I mean that's why I'm going to look at the back side it has been spoken of for many many years but the hidden part is this one here yeah but you come to Revelation chapter five what does it say Revelation chapter five verse 1. 1 okay this book is and I saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven silver men foreign okay this book okay was in the hand of Adam okay maybe yes diet we will look into it what the prophet says can I repeat something here Prophet preached a message standing in the game is there any person in the world who understands what does that means because he go support [Music] there was a gap when Adam forfeited the book and then there was a game has left his position uh to get the way of the Tree of Life tree of knowledge that's why you see the message of this message [Music] [Music] [Music] in the book [Music] um the way he says you know the book I'm referring tonight he says then the word linked to please now in the bride listening which book spoken word is the Original Seed he was sent to bring the way to be around there's a man that was sent to send the word to the bride so when he met who's that Rebecca he spoke to Rebecca and you know what happened already then after Rebecca has received the message [Music] the messenger LED Rebecca to Isaac and Rebecca remained on the back of uh common Rebecca until he saw Isaac then when he saw Isaac she saw Isaac she got off the camera she didn't remain on the back of her camel while Isaac is there right of Christ also because they come when she she comes and see the Lord Jesus Christ and foreign [Music] the book is made for a class of people okay for a certain classes now I will read just few things here uh now we call him a brown remita Abram now talking about the Seed of Abraham the Seed of Abraham the Bible says is Christ and now in this last days we see how a brother Brennan spoke of Abraham and his seeds [Music] and we have read it I think it's a previous week that Abraham when he saw him [Music] there's a time when he saw he met Melchizedek today no the prophet says all the attributes will do this oh God will do the same thing in the last days all the attributes the mind of God has to meet God then he says that is what all the attributes shall do in the end time now this king of Salem because the Bible says was God and he became Jesus and the LC became the problem that's how it is put here in the book who is this melchized [Music] he said and well he said let me read it for you he met Melchizedek okay I mean it's a bit quiet here If Abraham met him it is for the seed of God okay amen now the true revelation of Melchizedek comes into view was that foreign [Music] amen amen now we can read on and on we will read this pattern because we we will have another part for tomorrow the Lord willing I mean now I read you can part again [Music] but where is the Royal seed of Abra Imam [Music] where is their sign is where is their signs that he said as it was in the days of Sudan God came down and was manifested in human flesh as Sarah was thinking back in her heart a water says [Music] saw he's driving it back again brother to show the sign what happened and he took a how God came to Abraham and he prophesied a prophet because Sarah was on the back side but the God prophesied and because Sarah loved and God said why did Sarah Sarah left is there anything hard for God amen I mean at the time of life I shall return your wife shall have a son um showing the people that what happened back there he said the sign foreign this scripture is fulfilled meaning that the sign of Abraham when God could prophesy when Sarah was on the back side he did the same thing I mean and they said this day literally is this what libertarian is fulfilled meaning that that sign of Abraham is here with us okay amen now now before I close foreign God came down and was manifested in human flesh and they told what Sarah was thinking back our Buddha says [Music] and the last sign before the Gentile world was destroyed by fire seek out some of those foreign something like this is you know it's all this then the last side the last side the book was in the hands of Adam right I don't know if in the difference but when Adam forfeited the book s because the book called hookah in that book there was I mean not elsewhere I will try it again maybe for the last time Hobby what it meant now is the prophet says more than men were one [Music] and because now there is a law of restoration there should be one again it was not a place it was a place for men for the men so are we there together now the restoration would not put a cherubim there the restoration has to put again a man [Applause] if you know the law of restoration now he's ready let me put it to you like this reason why the sword what was the reason when God gave a brother Branham what was it foreign foreign [Music] [Music] so a God kicked him out of Eden and place the a the cherability I mean but that was not the place for sharabi Empire that's why the law of options I had to bring back men again foreign here we are now yeah it will cause problems to those who are not there when brother Brendan received that sword okay the question is what foreign that's now closing the game now he came in as a substitute now he says now he came to uh and a Sprinkle blood across you know when when there is a gap foreign why the blood of that blood is for Redemption to redeem is to bring back now God knows [Music] he had to come and close the game now although we were talking brother left and out left and right [Music] receive the message okay now he he says here he came as a substitute his blood um the word Redemption means bringing back all right amen bringing back bringing you back bringing me back [Music] that is redemption [Applause] if the Gap remains alone America now he says he sprinkled blood across the girl mostly that is redemption that's why because [Music] and they went they went you check it we will check it now very well because he says worry they went I won't say east or west but they went where he opened the book for God oh man I mean because they you are the children of one God I want you to find that whether he went west or east and give it to me all right now is there somebody who can see the sword now brother Brendan says yeah that's right later when it was revealed to him amen amen amen you all know about them the Lamb's Book of Life we still have to look into it because it's two books all together in the Book of Life are going to judgment that said God's prophets in the book of life you are judged according to your works yeah that's why the sleeping Vision the Bible says they will also receive White but of the world because they were judged and they were found worthy to receive white ropes and plainly it says those whose names were not found in the Book of Life were casting the Lake of Fire you you he has already judged you and found you to be holy um that is the bright in the Lamb's Book of Life we can still look at that it is in the book those in the Book of Life a prophet of God says to judgment amen you know when they were coming from the tribulation periodically and they ask who who are this because John could recognize the 144 000 to be the Jews but he didn't know these others because they were gentiles and and they said Barry this came from the Great Tribulation [Music] is this the bride foreign but when the Revelation struck him he said no no no no no no it can't be the bride the pride is not coming from the tribulation [Applause] amen you see the difference foreign those that are coming through that tribulation periodically [Music] 144 000. which you've seen last time that at the end they become the eunuchsia during the Millennium Millennium they come there as the eunuchsia foreign [Music] [Music] now let me repeat to you again I will read that part to you tomorrow in heaven amen amen that now when the seals are opened we were opened up just look at past the curtain of time [Music] now he says I will read it to you tomorrow [Music] they're better now in casually will be fought beyond the curtain of time equally once now because it was fought beyond the curtain of time it is there was a battle in heaven this battle was in heaven amen amen amen that was before the the kitten of time that's why it says Michael and his angels it never foreign [Music] [Music] amen yes but after the tribulation oh okay we'll check tomorrow again when it is the prophet was asked he said after direction now if then the King of the North started to move now showing their sign now the battle of Armageddon [Music] that shows that is you know how close is the rapture now what's more natural okay I mean but let us read the last thing here as it was in the days have we finished this one the the gap I mean what I will come the Lord willing tomorrow all right that's why the book was opened up and it says it's book foreign if foreign [Music] foreign [Music] that was at that time I had something here because that is this book of Hebrews again where is the sign of the Seed of Abraham I have a book we'll read it also when Abraham met him he was [Music] foreign and there was one I don't know if I can find this page here something but I'm losing now [Music] when he was here uh okay this is who is this Melchizedek but in this version is page 23 here okay he revealed himself as son of man [Music] when he came as a prophet okay okay when he came who came as a propheta Melchizedek did you see him as a prophet okay now really let's look at this but I'll read only display these two places and they will continue their Lord willing to University today okay without father without mothers [Music] [Music] has no beginning of days [Music] [Music] foreign the soul the logos logos when Spirit when God was a spirit that's why the Bible says he is the father of the spirits yeah then when he was logos [Music] foreign empathy Jesus was the logos logos now we read it logos out of the Lord goes which are more logos ouch the logos came forth the man which are more logos now if you are a Christian I'm not saying change does Christianity religion is something else Christianity is something else you ask what is Christianity what is Christianity I told you a Christ dwelled being okay is Christ indwelled [Music] same way amen amen you are not sure of his convictions he can come to service tomorrow okay at all they say he is religious a Christian God dwells in a Christian God dwells in a Christian okay amen I finish this one here why blessed be the name of the Lord something on the inside he spoke peace to me and he gave me eternal life and this life hey I met him you know the Seed of Abraham Abraham is supposed to make melchized that is the Royal Seed of Abraham is should it be even today [Music] all right amen I am so glad he says I'm so glad I met him he gave me communion foreign [Music] will look into it foreign [Music] but under the Seed of Abraham he comes as well [Music] theophanese you know if you I should visit I can only do it if I have no father no mother God wants to come to us as a theophany he will do it without father without mother but if he comes to us he was born away amen like because he came as a lamb at the end of time to come now your father
