[2:23:06] was no
[2:23:11] okay I think it is okay I will find it
[2:23:16] the piece of
[2:23:18] paper uh the
[2:23:21] quotation that I ask
[2:23:25] for now I don't see no it's bigger than
[2:23:30] that one God bless

[2:23:44] morning we are thankful to God
[2:23:47] [Music]
[2:23:51] the Lord willing when we live
[2:23:57] here we will find ourselves in
[2:24:02] leoon there's a pastor there Pastor Mak
[2:24:06] amen amen so they have arranged for
[2:24:11] us okay
[2:24:14] anyhow it's not time for
[2:24:17] the to report about this things
[2:24:21] now we all know about them we we'll be
[2:24:24] going
[2:24:26] there all
[2:24:28] right
[2:24:29] um last we ask a
[2:24:35] question about
[2:24:38] the Battle of
[2:24:45] amagon I wonder this who are asking
[2:24:51] talking about underworld
[2:25:00] under don't they know what is the
[2:25:04] underworld okay they don't
[2:25:07] know do they know about the coming of
[2:25:11] the battle
[2:25:16] of no
[2:25:22] all right amen but
[2:25:25] today I will read for few
[2:25:30] minutes about
[2:25:34] the just to finish up
[2:25:39] some part of
[2:25:42] this
[2:25:47] white amen amen
[2:25:50] and that one it is very impossible to
[2:25:57] impersonate because impersonation
[2:26:01] is everywhere
[2:26:07] now the reason being
[2:26:11] that uh John
[2:26:16] Wason to come
[2:26:18] up and
[2:26:21] Prophet told
[2:26:23] us that was after the seven Church
[2:26:29] ages I mean he he has seen the seven
[2:26:35] church amen because you can only be
[2:26:40] sumon
[2:26:43] up after you have
[2:26:46] seen because seven churches speak of
[2:26:49] time
[2:26:52] amen amen now he Wason to come
[2:26:58] up after he has seen the
[2:27:03] time he seen that time of the church
[2:27:08] ages because if you uh we are going back
[2:27:14] you are going back to the church ages
[2:27:20] you are only going to continue with a
[2:27:25] [Music]
[2:27:28] reputation but as the prophet
[2:27:31] said the seventh
[2:27:34] seal is the end of the time of all
[2:27:40] things amen amen amen and uh there are
[2:27:44] some
[2:27:45] people that are still waiting for the
[2:27:48] revelation of the seventh season
[2:27:55] but we'll come with that to show that
[2:27:59] seven seal was
[2:28:04] revealed
[2:28:06] but if you are still residing
[2:28:10] in
[2:28:14] churches time of the
[2:28:17] churches amen amen you are not in line
[2:28:21] with the revelation of
[2:28:26] God because according to the word of
[2:28:29] God the seven seal which we will come
[2:28:34] will read some
[2:28:35] things and to show that the seven
[2:28:40] seal is was
[2:28:44] revealed
[2:28:46] amen let's wait for that
[2:28:50] we are we are talking about it every
[2:28:53] day but only you cannot impersonate
[2:29:00] that amen that's why the prophet
[2:29:05] said
[2:29:10] John the message came to
[2:29:13] John and said come
[2:29:18] up and I will show
[2:29:21] you
[2:29:22] to to
[2:29:26] come now if you are told
[2:29:30] that you hear that
[2:29:32] word I will show you
[2:29:35] things to
[2:29:38] come
[2:29:41] meaning the
[2:29:44] past will remain the
[2:29:48] past meaning the there's
[2:29:52] another he says I'll show
[2:29:56] you the
[2:29:58] things that say
[2:30:02] it all right here
[2:30:05] Amen brother you remember even 20 Page I
[2:30:10] mean chapter
[2:30:13] 21 21 amen uh let me make sure that I'm
[2:30:18] trying to C the right thing
[2:30:20] amen it say where it says come
[2:30:28] up that
[2:30:31] was joh and I will show you the
[2:30:38] bride Revelation 21 yes verse 9
[2:30:43] M and there came unto me one of the
[2:30:46] Seven Angels which had the seven vials
[2:30:50] full of the seven last plagues and
[2:30:52] talked with me saying come hither I will
[2:30:55] show Thee the bride the Lamb's
[2:30:58] wife and he carried me away in the
[2:31:02] spirit to a great and high mountain and
[2:31:04] showed me that great City the holy
[2:31:07] Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from
[2:31:10] God
[2:31:11] Amen okay
[2:31:14] amen I will show you the bride
[2:31:22] it is himself who introduced the
[2:31:29] bread and even
[2:31:31] here I am glad to
[2:31:35] worship
[2:31:39] here because I I heard him introducing
[2:31:44] the
[2:31:47] bride who is the bride of Christ
[2:31:52] I'm not talking about the Mage
[2:31:55] Church talking about the
[2:32:00] bride amen amen so the
[2:32:04] bride
[2:32:06] has the
[2:32:09] weight as my Prophet
[2:32:13] says she is Alpha and
[2:32:18] Omega now Alpha and
[2:32:22] Omega that is the
[2:32:24] wife of
[2:32:27] Christ all right amen did you read
[2:32:33] that amen
[2:32:36] no and he says
[2:32:39] also the
[2:32:41] bride comes
[2:32:46] twice amen all right amen and
[2:32:51] uh that's why
[2:32:54] now we are not in a message
[2:33:01] church because the so
[2:33:08] churches some
[2:33:11] even they hate one
[2:33:14] another that can't be the
[2:33:22] the bride of
[2:33:24] Christ is like
[2:33:29] Christ amen amen and she doesn't
[2:33:36] impersonate she she's receiving from the
[2:33:45] husband that's why he said be therefore
[2:33:55] if God is
[2:33:57] Holy then he will
[2:33:59] be worshiped by a holy
[2:34:05] person

[2:44:17] time for
[2:44:20] certain
[2:44:23] people
[2:44:25] amen that's why I was reading even
[2:44:29] yesterday when the prophet
[2:44:32] said you have heard
[2:44:38] from you sit down and check
[2:44:43] that you have heard from your theop

[2:45:00] not real
[2:45:04] body will come to
[2:45:06] that to look at this
[2:45:10] bodies the prophet told me
[2:45:13] that and you he told you about

[2:45:50] but she
[2:45:52] says but
[2:45:55] you you have two
[2:46:01] bodies I
[2:46:02] said that means
[2:46:06] god is busy with
[2:46:09] this
[2:46:11] girl she
[2:46:13] said you've got two
[2:46:16] bodies and that's why I want to come to
[2:46:21] you to help
[2:46:23] me
[2:46:27] out all right
[2:46:29] am now if you have two

[2:54:01] things he has experienced in
[2:54:10] hisop theop is not this body is not this
[2:54:14] big head

[2:54:36] hearing there's different kinds
[2:54:42] of you'll see when we will we shall come
[2:54:45] to
[2:54:46] read where the Prophet
[2:54:50] says if you go beyond the
[2:54:56] dimensions you hear the brother singing
[2:54:59] that
[2:55:05] song
[2:55:07] changing yeah changing Dimensions amen
[2:55:10] yes amen mhm amen changing Dimensions

[2:55:23] Stu
[2:55:27] somewhere if you go with somebody who
[2:55:32] loves beer or
[2:55:38] marijana and you arrive the people
[2:55:44] drinking it's easy to lose him
[2:55:52] amen
[2:55:55] amen
[2:56:03] coming
[2:56:05] but a child of
[2:56:07] God let me tell you something
[2:56:11] amen didn't the Bible
[2:56:15] say uh we I'm still coming to the White
[2:56:21] Stone the Bible
[2:56:25] says he who hates his
[2:56:30] brother let me
[2:56:33] repeat he who hates his
[2:56:37] brother he who hates his sister sister
[2:56:46] [Music]
[2:56:50] what's the
[2:56:52] answer he is
[2:56:58] like he he's talking about a
[2:57:01] person like if he says
[2:57:05] K the first man to
[2:57:09] kill
[2:57:13] was now if it says He Who hat his
[2:57:19] brother it's
[2:57:24] like he doesn't say he hates because
[2:57:29] [Music]
[2:57:30] of no he says he is
[2:57:36] lying the original
[2:57:43] killer is that right
[2:57:46] amen okay amen now let
[2:57:50] us continue for few
[2:57:56] minutes that's why I was reading even
[2:58:03] recently the day of
[2:58:09] redemption okay
[2:58:12] amen and the people are preaching
[2:58:17] it day of redemption day of
[2:58:20] redemption amen amen
[2:58:23] but which day is
[2:58:27] this we don't do you have a
[2:58:31] calendar that tells you that the day of
[2:58:35] redemption is on such and
[2:58:41] such amen
[2:58:44] amen and where the people will start
[2:58:47] running two and
[2:58:51] trying to make things
[2:58:53] right you will
[2:58:56] never that's why the Lord Jesus knowing
[2:58:59] that we couldn't redeem
[2:59:03] ourselves became himself without
[2:59:09] sin to shed his
[2:59:12] blood and he knew that the only gospel
[2:59:18] will come
[2:59:21] through his
[2:59:25] blood because the blood of
[2:59:28] Jesus that's why he's a
[2:59:33] Kingsman and it says we were
[2:59:38] Redeemed by
[2:59:42] whom right
[2:59:48] I said
[2:59:49] D people were
[2:59:57] wondering why now it seems like Pastor
[3:00:00] is making Jesus our friend
[3:00:03] now because it
[3:00:07] says
[3:00:09] brother is because they say what a
[3:00:11] friend I have Amen in Jesus am
[3:00:19] my
[3:00:20] friend people can hate you the whole
[3:00:25] world but as long as you have
[3:00:31] Jesus amen
[3:00:34] amen it won't bother
[3:00:38] you if you have Jesus as your
[3:00:43] friend then you own all
[3:00:49] you have
[3:00:51] all because in Jesus we have found
[3:00:56] all that's why they say Give Me
[3:01:00] Jesus and that's enough for
[3:01:02] me I need I don't need Jesus
[3:01:08] End Amen he is everything he's
[3:01:14] everything he everything to me
[3:01:18] is everything
[3:01:20] everything he everything to me he's my
[3:01:25] father my sister my father and my mother
[3:01:32] he a everything to me amen
[3:01:38] amen
[3:01:40] he
[3:01:43] naturally I can't show you somebody and
[3:01:46] say this is my blood
[3:01:54] do you know my
[3:01:57] family I I mean in this
[3:02:01] way have you seen my
[3:02:07] father my
[3:02:10] mother or you've just seen her but where
[3:02:14] is where is she
[3:02:17] [Music]
[3:02:20] do you know she's not with
[3:02:22] me if I say
[3:02:26] mother I have my mother passed
[3:02:32] on is that
[3:02:34] right
[3:02:37] now but I have something
[3:02:44] Eternal that cannot pass away
[3:02:49] and God made it he made it this
[3:02:55] way if talking about the Kingman
[3:03:04] Redeemer this Gospel of the
[3:03:08] seals it makes you one with
[3:03:15] God the whole world can live
[3:03:20] amen but the king
[3:03:22] man cannot leave
[3:03:26] you that's why he came shed his blood
[3:03:30] and he it is
[3:03:33] impossible God to leave
[3:03:36] [Applause]
[3:03:38] you amen amen amen because you are of
[3:03:42] the bloodline
[3:03:48] the person of the
[3:03:54] bloodline not forced to do
[3:04:00] anything that's why the the prophet of
[3:04:03] God
[3:04:04] say your pro your
[3:04:08] theop you have
[3:04:12] heard before
[3:04:19] you have
[3:04:21] heard it doesn't say you are going to
[3:04:25] hear
[3:04:26] no that means what is preached to
[3:04:31] you you have already
[3:04:35] heard
[3:04:37] amen amen am that's
[3:04:40] why if the way comes to
[3:04:43] you is just amen
[3:04:47] [Music]
[3:04:49] that's
[3:04:50] and you you you are not
[3:04:53] struggling to do the will of God no
[3:04:57] because
[3:04:58] your is the will of
[3:05:03] God
[3:05:07] amen
[3:05:09] amen you know I we read the
[3:05:14] books especially
[3:05:18] uh those who know
[3:05:19] me they know even I
[3:05:24] I sometimes I don't
[3:05:27] sleep or I sleep early in the
[3:05:32] morning even even
[3:05:36] today early in the
[3:05:39] morning all right why because a real
[3:05:45] Christian ra his
[3:05:48] [Music]
[3:05:51] Bible he
[3:05:53] read spoken spoken
[3:05:58] ween when you
[3:06:01] come preach by
[3:06:06] Revelation
[3:06:09] he but can you hear what he says because
[3:06:12] he
[3:06:14] says you have heard
[3:06:18] that's why you
[3:06:22] here
[3:06:25] amen you remember that part we have
[3:06:31] read he speaks about the fourth
[3:06:35] dimension you know
[3:06:39] radios all those
[3:06:42] things amen
[3:06:44] amen of which the children of
[3:06:51] today they are not going
[3:06:54] anywhere unless by
[3:06:58] predestination because of these things
[3:07:00] that are
[3:07:04] happening you won't even
[3:07:06] find a
[3:07:10] child
[3:07:12] because the moment they start
[3:07:16] to hear
[3:07:20] they hear these things of the
[3:07:25] world amen amen now that's why the true
[3:07:30] Christianity is something you have
[3:07:36] heard
[3:07:38] amen amen that's why he says you have
[3:07:42] heard from
[3:07:45] your now if somebody
[3:07:48] comes with something different you don't
