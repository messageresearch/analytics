I'm waiting for the interpreter this evening. Oh yeah. Before we read the word of God, we are going to pray. Maybe before you pray, I give you a moment just say something about bra because I know you knew each other. Amen. Amen. Amen. The one standing before you is he &gt;&gt; but he's originally from heaven. Amen. Amen. Amen. I appreciate the moment brother gave me. So what they are saying about I'm also a witness to that most of the time will be the first one to arrive at church. So he has his own parking which brother Dub always is taking care of. If he can find somebody parking on that spot, he's not he's not feeling well about that. &gt;&gt; What I learned about him, he was so humbled, you wouldn't say he's an elderly like that and he had respect to the saints. If there can be somebody maybe he's carrying his jacket. So he'll take him aside. &gt;&gt; And then he will say there's this certain brother. He gave me something. &gt;&gt; There's this kind of a sister. He gave me something. and then he will say I'm just asking that you offer a prayer over and then one day he said at home there's a certain spirit hovering there I don't know what it is I'm requesting I took as he has said and we went to his place and we were welcomed with a good spirit and we prayed. The following Sunday he said I'm free all those spirits are gone there is peace at home. I'm thankful saints and he was a soldier. Uh it's not long that he came to the message &gt;&gt; but it it seemed like he's been there for 30 years. He's not dead but he's asleep. God bless you my brother. Amen. [Applause] foreign. Amen. There's a man sent from God. You send a man amongst us. You give us a because of the weight to that man. [Music] Let your man speak it like that man. Amen. Amen. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We are thankful bless you. I bring the greetings as well from our pastor who was the pastor to our brother. Yes. Just few hours before I came I was with him. He wished to be here. He say let's just go and comfort the family because we know our brother is in a better place. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I just want to tell you that we our brother. &gt;&gt; Everyone at church knows him very well because he treated every one of us so special like we are kings. He he can treat you the in a good way. thinking is just you. Thinking is just you. Every one of us shall when I arrive with my car. He will show it from far and then he will stand on the on the at the road. from he thought because I'm from he was a good man phoned me today called me today &gt;&gt; he so do you know how brother received a message so he was asking me I said I don't know he said while he's doing some make approach him and said, "Brother, you are at the right place. God has brought you here so that you can pave your way back to heaven. I want to tell you this. Before our brother came to church to look after our cars, we had many challenges. The local people, they were stealing the wheel caps of our car, the valve for the wheel, the spare wheels. And then until the church hired him from that day until today, we never received any complaint. So, uh, Amen. I I I personally made a joke out of that for sure. Maybe they see that he looks like thinking that if he can catch you when they by the time they report ah, you'll just be dust. It's me holding me by the hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. But he was a nice brother indeed. [Music] Ever smiling. I want to tell you this evening, not joking. He is in heaven. He made the right decision. He's young again. If you want to go to heaven, just visit that church of ours. And I believe in this evening. Our present here has made a changes in the area. We know ourself. We know where we come from. We know where we are. We know where we are going. And I'm not lying about that. True indeed. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why when we met him, we felt like I was going all over the place, churches and whatever. But since I met these people, I'm a changed person. May his soul rest well under the altar. That's where God put him. Amen. Amen. So tonight, I'm not going to take much of your time. We were here yesterday. We had a wonderful service with the family and the neighbors. Continue again this evening and then we will finish tomorrow as we lay his remainings. May God richly bless you by honoring the word of God. Let's stand to our feet and sing a worshiing song. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God see See God. [Music] Oh my way. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Amen. As we open our Bible in the book of Philippians chapter 2 from verse 1 to 8. Amen. Philippians chapter 2 from verse 1 to8. If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through strive of vain glory, but in loneliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. &gt;&gt; Let this man be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and ma was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I want to talk to you this evening about the unveiling of God. So yesterday we were talking about an amateur God. Amateur God, an unveiling of God, one and the same thing. We just continue from where we stopped yesterday. Amen. Amen. So the scripture here says everything that you do it should be in love in joy and and we must be in one accord, one mind. And let that mind that was in Christ be in you who being in the form of God not robbery to be equal with. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So yesterday we gave the example of Moses. The Bible says Moses &gt;&gt; was God before Pharaoh and Aaron will be the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it was the pattern &gt;&gt; or the protocol that God used to reach us. So in life follow the protocol of life because our God He's a god of order. He do things orderly. So we need to follow things orderly to be able to please him. Now God in the beginning was God was not God. He became God after a certain level when he come down. when he come down his last journey on earth was when he get inside a man and when he's inside a man that man becomes God and then it was the end of God in this world and from that time when that man take a step it was God walking amen that is Jabu was an amate God. God has unveiled himself in him. Maybe other people have not had an opportunity of talking about him. But since he received the message, he was a transformed person. He was a person, a new person, not that old person. Amen. Amen. And it was not when he was talking but you saw his life. I read here the man of God says the weight had to come from Moses first. You see one man the word of God must first come from him. Moses had the way. They were written by God. Nobody could interpret them. But Moses had to interpret them. That's the reason he veiled his faith. Amen. Amen. So God had to come down and incarnate himself in Moses. When the people need the interpretation of the word of God, they must get it from amen. But there were those that said we want to get the interpretation from God and when God come, they run away. because you cannot face him. That's why you cannot see God with a naked eye. He has to hide himself in a human being. And that human being, God says, he is God. He made us God. Here it is. We could pick it, pick it up and everything else, but it's got to be revealed. In order to reveal, Moses has to come to the people. Amen. Amen. Amen. So many a time we miss God because when we look at a human being and despise him not knowing God veiled himself that person and Moses was that person when God was ve I continue hid behind the veil Moses veiled his face. Moses was the living word veiled. Then the people saw the pillar of fire. Now say now we are satisfied. But let Moses speak because he speaks of God. Don't let God speak lest we die. Moses walked right in that pillar of fire. When Moses was walking, it was God working. When you listen to Moses, you were listening to God. Don't say, I want to bypass Moses and listen to God. If God can face you when you are not with him, you will not stand him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The anointing &gt;&gt; is a person. &gt;&gt; The anointing is the word Christ means the anointed one. The anointed one. That is the word Christ. Then Moses was Christ in his days. He was the anointed one. Jeremiah Jeremiah &gt;&gt; was Christ in his days with a portion of the word for that day. You are the anointed one of this day. That means in this day you are Christ this day you are God. Amen. But when Jesus came, he came as a redeemer anointed [Music] one one and that was both Moses and all that was in Moses and all the word and all the godheadly was in him. That's the reason the whole temple veil rent and the mercy seat come in a perfect view. He was the anointed one. From that time we have access. Amen. To the mercy seat. We have us access to the most holy place. That is why the Bible here says the mind that was in Christ be in us and who being in the form of God saw it not robbery to be equal with him. As I was saying yesterday, our pastor normally use this word not creation, not formation, but we were processed. Something that you process is something that comes from you. You don't make it. You don't create it, but you take it from you. That is why we talk about the man of God who was sent from from within God. Then he come to us to preach the gospel unto us. Notice now the veil in human flesh the promised way to this age also be veiled. We are the veil that has the word in us. Notice the sin loving church members are and sinners. cannot see it because of the human veil. The wise and the prudent cannot see it. Do you understand? The only people that can see it is those that has the same spirit. As the Bible says, we must do things as we are in one accord. When I speak and you are listening is the deep calling to the deep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason they couldn't see him. Why he's a man? They will ask themselves many question. Where did he come from? What fellowship card does he have? What church does he belong to? What group he belong to? What school did he have? Where did he get his education? &gt;&gt; Well, this man was born. &gt;&gt; According to the tradition according to the legend of him around here. Amen. &gt;&gt; This man was born out of holy wetlock. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But they couldn't see that is God. Those that can see him is those that have the same spirit that is in him because we say Lord Jesus Christ. If it's Lord Jesus Christ and you are the anointed one, that means you are Christ. When you are Christ and the Christ speak, you will say amen because he speaks to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The only people that can hear and understand the word of God are the one that comes from God. It can't help it. We we are just preaching this evening. But others cannot grab because this weight is not made for them. Those that grab it is made for them and that is life. So notice the veil, the human flesh, you see God in a flesh and you conclude and get convinced that that sister that is walking there is God. Amen. Amen. Now the sin loving people could not see that those traditional religious people they couldn't see that because he was a man the human flesh God when I said is the one that created heaven and earth I'm referring to that God came down and he indwell himself in a human flesh. When you walk when you walk is God walking. When you speak is God speaking. Everything that you do is God doing it in you. You just use your Amen. Amen. We we have seen that with our brother Amen. Amen. H &gt;&gt; he was a kind man indeed. Ever smiling loving all the people. You will think he love you alone. He love I don't know all the people in mood. He knows all of them and he treated them supposedly. Only a person who has the spirit of God can do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The others will get tired. But if you see someone doing the work he loved the most, he does not get tired. &gt;&gt; But you see what he did so that he could bypass all of them smart wise people. He just re reveal himself like he promised Moses. I'll speak to them through a prophet and he was son of man and a prophet &gt;&gt; and some of them recognize it about 100% of the 100% in the world. They believe it. The rest of them didn't. &gt;&gt; He was just the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When God is in a flesh, only few will recognize him. Those that recognize him is those that were with him before the foundation of God. As I normally say, the journey that we are in is not the new journey. We were in heaven. Come here on earth. live a good life at the right time will go back to heaven because those that come from God will go back to God. You know when Jesus was talking about Judas, he said he he he wish he was never born because he was born for damnation. There are certain people that are born to go to hell. Even if you can preach the word of God to them, they will never understand. But we are proud of us today when we talk in the funeral of our brother. Amen. Amen. whom we saw in this world until we say if there is a heaven to go that's where he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; A man of God here says, "A type way back when David was leaving the temple, a rejected king went down through the street and a little old up fellow growing along never did like him. He called him old hypogre or something. He spit right on his face. And that God pulled a sword said, "I let that dog head stay on him &gt;&gt; and spit on my king." And then David said, "Let him alone." God told him that. And David probably didn't know what he said. Went up on the mountain, looking back crying. Unlike David because the Bible says, is a man after the heart of God. He was a king in Israel and he was a prophet and in the city of the millennium to come, God is honoring David because David was the man that pleases God. So when he was rejected by the people there, they were spitting on him. They were belittling him. But he was a king. If you are a king, no one can take your kingship. The people will try and do whatever they want. But David was remain like that. Even if he was running up to the mountain, he was running there knowing that he's a king, the rejected king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the man of God says, "But after 800 years, from there, from there, the son of David was climbing the same mountain that David climbed, looking out, weeping over Jerusalem, a rejected king, and they spit in his face. Don't you see is the same thing? See that word coming down following on today. Always rejected by the majority and believe in the minority. Amen. Amen. David climbed up the mountain with few people because with few people those few people when they look at David they look at Eve as the king. They looked at him as God. That's why always with God is the minority. Those few people are the one that always look up to the right. Many a time the majority is the majority. Some of them they don't understand what they are following but they are just good followers. But with God they give us the understanding. That is why when God is in a flesh we can be able to tell and even say we have seen many people in the message many people in Christianity but this one is a peculiar one. No wonder the Bible says in Israel they had the spirit of God but while having the spirit of God but Joshua and Caleb had another spirit. They were above all and the the minority were the one that saw what is happening Joshua and Caleb. The rest receive the wrong report from others. Amen. And they follow to their damnation. That is why it was only John who could identify the Lord Jesus Christ because he saw God whom he worshiped condescended upon Jesus. Then he said this is the lamb of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But others they still stick to him. Even if he point them to Jesus, you know they say in life a transformation or the changes maybe in the companies or wherever in life are not easily acceptable. If the company can say we are retrenching, we we we are retrenching. We we need this number for certain reason. Yeah. You'll see many prayer requests in the church so that it cannot affect me. But a child of God will relax. You will say, "Lord God, if you still want me to work for this company, I will remain. If you want me to get out, it will happen." But Lord God, you know better. If you just relax as a child, have you realized that some of the things cannot be changed even if you can pray for them and fast for them as hard as you can. If God say I take you tonight and you know about that, you can pray until you bleed. But tonight you will go. God has never made a mistake. He's always in time. He knows our destination. If he knows your destiny, why are you worried? Just say, Lord God, I don't know why I was born. I don't know why I'm here. You are the driver of this thing. The day I was born and the day I will die, you God know it. And my destination whether is hell, whether is heaven, I cannot go anywhere unless the area you have prepared for me. You know that is God who prepared hell is God who prepared heaven. God knows who's going to heaven and who's going to hell. The people that are going to hell, even if there will be that are going to hell because it's where they belong, I want to tell you as a as a Christian, relax, maybe I should repeat it again. Relax. Because if you don't relax when we go out, you go to the nearest store and grand and get grandpa &gt;&gt; because you're just stressing yourself. You are just thinking too much. Relax. Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows &gt;&gt; everything about us. Oh, try and fast and pray harder and go to the all night prayer. Try it. It's not going to help you. A complete job was done. A complete job was done by God himself. &gt;&gt; Don't you see is the same thing? See that word coming on down following on down today always rejected by the majority and believe by the minority. Remember the son of God was not revealed. to Sodom two messengers was and that's right but God himself reveal himself in a human flesh &gt;&gt; was revealed to Abraham Abraham &gt;&gt; and watch what &gt;&gt; he done reveal himself again today God is revealing himself again today. So today the children of God must just believe. Abraham for God to visit him. He did not fast and pray and pray and all those things. He was just sitting and God said shalom shalom. Then he felt like who am I to be visited by my God? The one who created the heaven and earth. He was walking on the on the desert. But he visited my home. But the two messengers go to and for condemnation to destroy it. So if on the other side God is is destroying on the other side God is blessing. Be the blessed one. Be the one that God will visit when he's destroying the world. Be like Abraham while you are relaxing in the word of God. He he visit you and he will say shalom. God today he's eating food. He's walking. is waking is greeting the people because the end of God was in a man in our flesh and the man of God says our age is so special because God shed himself us. The children of God incarnate God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read second Corinthians &gt;&gt; chapter 4 verse 1-3 &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 4 from verse 1 to3 Therefore seeing we have this mystery as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced ounc the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftness, nor handing handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be he, it is hid to them that are lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In whom the God of this world, &gt;&gt; it's fine. Verse three. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if our gospel be he, it is heat to them that are lost. And those that are lost are not getting lost like now. They were lost to begin with. And today they will be lost. And after death, they will be lost because their destination is in prison in hell. Amen. That's how it is. The stand you took is the stand that sustain you today and is the stand that will make you reach your destination. The Bible says Enoch was a man who walked with and at the right time he was no more. He just walk with God. I want to tell you this. Don't even try to say I will try harder and read the word of God and do this and this. Don't even try. Say God do that in me. That's it. He's going to take God come to you inside you and from that time because he's God he will do the right thing. [Applause] I know this young man he had a problem with cigarette. I stayed with him there in I prayed for him to leave cigarette tomorrow will come pray again. I just smoked help. I just smoked again. Then I started to realize If someone is of this but the day God visit him no one will pray for him but God will let him leave the cigarette and the day he left the cigarette he will never want to smoke it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how God works. when he visited a person that person will never be the same as again. But sometimes because we are human being we are parents. We don't want our kids to live the wrong way. We will call the elders call the pastors. We will pray and take for counseling and so forth and so forth. But they are not changing. But wait until God change their life. &gt;&gt; Let God do the thing and is the done deal and is God who call the people to his word. If you can come to the word of God not being called by God that's a problem. when I was still at school and received the message at high school. Then I have that joy and I will share it to my brothers, to my friends, to my family and others followed me. And one of my friends follow and follow, follow and follow. And then one day he said to me, "My friend, sit down and talk." Then I sit down, then we talk. He said, "You know what? This thing of the word of God or this church of God is a is a very good church and is taking people to heaven and I've seen it and I'm the witness." But you know what? It's not for me. So my friend, bye-bye. Even today, he never get to my church since he left that day. &gt;&gt; Then I said to him, My friend, thanks for being honest. Because there are other people you will push and push but you are not helping yourself. You are not helping them because you are pushing but the day God comes no longer pushing things goes automatically. All the people should know their standing, the word of God because God now has cons condescended in the flesh of a human being until we can declare that this one is going to heaven. The word of God brings separation to the people who are not God incarnate. You are devil incarnate. There's no neutral place. Why are we preaching the gospel? We are preaching the gospel as God is using us like the mother eagle. So that when I preach like this, one amongst you, I was longing for this kind of a gospel. Come to the tabernacle, we baptize you. Then we are sure that you follow he's in heaven. Gone are those days whereby we are probing. We are not sure but he was good. know today we know is God who knows. Now the Bible is saying who's God? &gt;&gt; We are God. We are God. We are not the creator of heaven and earth. We are him. He is us. Because Jesus says he's in us. I'm in him. We are in him who is in us. We are Christ. We are the anointed one. Nothing can shift you from the position that God has put you. If you can know that, you no longer worry what the people say about you. What is the condition of life? Just relax upon the word of God. Just sing for the Lord. Just live for the Lord because you know the things of this world that you can see with the naked eye, they are all temporal, they will all come to an end. Now we are looking above our flesh. God bless you. Amen. Amen. Let's stand to our feet as we sing. You can come. Amen. Amen. [Music] Shab. [Music] Oh sha. [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] my god. Sing it one more time. Oh, Yeah. Heat.

We are &gt;&gt; we are just going to take the last one and uh maybe if there is a I just see that at the back there's an offering basket whatever that you'd like to offer to the family. Let's just take one song that says how many know that song. [Music] [Music] Kayal [Music] [Music] Kay. I sat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] My Lord [Music] must Oh, [Music] I know my over [Music] [Music] he's mating. [Music] Not the heat. [Music] Fire [Music] on the earth. [Music] Oh, hallelujah. [Applause] I'm just going to ask brother Harvest to just come and close the service with a word of prayer and then after that we'll welcome the family member to just uh give us the final announcements and then we will be dispersed. You can even just bless and pray for the offering. Amen. Gracious Lord Almighty, we like to thank you this evening. We thank you, Father, for your presence that has been with us here. Father, we thank you for your word of comfort, Lord Almighty, for in your word. That is where we find comfort. Father, we know that we cannot find it among ourselves. We cannot find it from our neighbors. Unless you come, Father, and incarnate them. That's when you'll know that when they speak is you speaking. the brothers and the sisters family. Let them relax.
