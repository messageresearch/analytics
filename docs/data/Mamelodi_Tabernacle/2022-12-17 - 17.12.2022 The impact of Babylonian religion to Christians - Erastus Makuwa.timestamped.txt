[1:10:40] God willing to
[1:10:46] um
[1:10:47] to verse 25.25

[1:11:32] while still waiting for the real one
[1:11:36] God bless you children of God
[1:11:40] I'm going to read here
[1:11:44] who I am not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:11:46] Christ for it is the power of God unto
[1:11:50] salvation
[1:11:51] to everyone that believeth to Jew first
[1:11:54] and also to the Greek
[1:12:02] [Music]

[1:12:22] [Music]
[1:12:55] because that which may be known of God
[1:12:59] is manifest
[1:13:02] in them for God that showed it to them
[1:13:07] or I was 18 for the wrath of God is
[1:13:10] revealed from Heaven against all
[1:13:12] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[1:13:16] who hold the truth in unrighteousness
[1:13:29] [Music]
[1:13:33] because that which may be known to God
[1:13:36] is Manifest in them for God had showed
[1:13:41] it unto them
[1:13:46] dead
[1:13:51] for the invisible things of him from the
[1:13:55] creation of the world as any sin being
[1:13:59] understood by the things that are made
[1:14:01] even his eternal power and good hate so
[1:14:06] that they are without excuse
[1:14:09] foreign
[1:14:35] but became vain in their imagination and
[1:14:39] their foolish heart was darkened him
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:57] traversing themselves to be wise they
[1:15:00] became fools
[1:15:05] and change the glory of the
[1:15:08] uncorruptable god into an image made
[1:15:11] like to a corruptable man and to beds
[1:15:15] and food for food and beasts and
[1:15:18] creeping things
[1:15:23] [Music]
