[2:26] language. They may believe the same

[2:35] so that they may be
[2:38] harmony. He says he poured

[2:47] kinos pouring out. He poured
[2:51] himself emptied himself
[2:55] into his
[2:57] wife. Amen. Amen. Not a
[3:00] church but the bride.
[3:05] Amen.

[3:10] What a wonderful husband. Amen.
[3:15] And so will the
[3:18] bride. Nothing can harm
[3:21] me. For if the seed be planted, the
[3:25] water will raise it up
[3:30] again. the water of life.
[3:35] Amen. Amen. Amen. Just like a a mama
[3:38] taking care of her flower every
[3:44] morning, the the first thing when she
[3:46] wakes
[3:47] up, she goes to the
[3:52] garden to greet the
[3:55] flowers. How are you? How was the night?
[4:00] Because I understand we as we said this
[4:04] last time,
[4:07] I said something like I I bought some
[4:11] flowers and
[4:14] uh now this the the sales lady
[4:20] there, I said to her, you know, I love
[4:23] this type of a
[4:26] flower, but I had one
[4:30] But uh it's not
[4:34] healthy. Amen. And uh he said to
[4:38] me, "Okay,
[4:42] brother, come here."
[4:46] So I moved closer to her
[4:50] and she says, "Now I want to I want to
[4:53] lecture you on something.
[4:57] [Music]
[4:58] Th this flower,
[5:02] if you buy this
[5:05] flower and you take it to your
[5:09] place, when you reach your
[5:13] place, don't just dig a hole and push it
[5:18] in. You must talk to the
[5:23] flower. First thing you must welcome the
[5:28] flower and say well flower still in a
[5:33] pot now you have
[5:37] arrived this is going to be your new
[5:39] home
[5:42] now. Amen. Amen. My children now this
[5:45] and who and
[5:48] when now you live in this
[5:51] place. There's a dog around here, but
[5:54] don't
[5:56] worry, it will be a friend as
[5:59] well. And and she
[6:02] says, "If then h when the time you you
[6:06] bought the
[6:08] flower, the flower was facing
[6:12] east, make sure that when you reach
[6:16] home, you put it the same way."
[6:22] Amen. Exactly how God placed us.
[6:30] Amen. Amen. The way we were in heaven
[6:35] in the
[6:36] east because he placed the the first
[6:41] man. Amen. Amen. He placed us also here
[6:45] eastward.
[6:48] Now I'm talking about
[6:51] spiritual because east that's where the
[6:55] whole thing
[6:57] began. The Lord shall come from the
[7:00] east. So he has put us spiritually
[7:06] eastward. Because that's how we were
[7:10] positioned in heaven.
[7:15] So if you you you buy the flower from
[7:17] that
[7:19] place facing
[7:23] east. Now you say a flower has no face.
[7:25] It
[7:27] is it
[7:29] has you look at it you can see
[7:33] that it's facing this way.
[7:38] If you don't know what I
[7:40] mean show me your flower. I'll show you.
[7:46] Amen. Amen. Amen. And
[7:49] then he she says,
[7:52] "Then if you dig you dig a hole,
[7:56] you walk around with
[7:59] it. It should be a a a partnership
[8:03] there. It should be there." So you come
[8:06] to a
[8:07] place and I said would you be
[8:10] comfortable here?
[8:14] Amen. Amen. If you say in yourself
[8:18] yes that means that that is the flowers.
[8:22] Yes.
[8:25] Amen. Amen. I'll show you here
[8:30] that God don't just put you anywhere.
[8:36] It's in agreement.
[8:41] For he says, "How can the two walk
[8:45] together?" So before God can put you
[8:48] here, he has to sign an agreement with
[8:54] you. Amen. Amen. So then you put that
[8:59] flower
[8:59] there. Then she says then you'll see the
[9:05] flower. She will enjoy the
[9:09] place and accept the
[9:13] environment. I said I have learned a
[9:16] great lesson
[9:19] today because now me being a pastor.
[9:25] I now apply it
[9:28] spiritually and now I have seen
[9:32] something. Amen. Amen. And I said you
[9:36] are true. You are it's
[9:38] true because
[9:41] God spoke to this flower.
[9:45] [Music]
[9:46] Amen. Amen. And he spoke it into
[9:49] existence.
[9:51] And the prophet of God says then he put
[9:54] some
[9:56] potentials in this flower. And he said
[9:59] to the flower, when you are buried in
[10:02] the ground, you must come
[10:06] forth. Amen. Amen. So springtime
[10:10] comes. We see now a resurrection
[10:15] coming. Amen. Amen. And that's why the
[10:18] power of
[10:19] resurrection is in us
[10:22] already. The Bible say that the spirit
[10:25] of whom that raised Jesus
[10:28] Christ if that spirit is in
[10:31] us the
[10:35] body. Amen.
[10:37] So he has put the potentials
[10:41] in you
[10:44] so that to know how to
[10:48] maneuver and the prophet says and you
[10:51] know what to
[10:52] [Music]
[10:55] do. Amen. Amen. You can't be trapped
[11:00] somewhere. You know what to
[11:04] do. When there's problem
[11:07] coming, you have
[11:12] potential.
[11:14] Amen. You exactly know what to
[11:18] do when the people are breaking
[11:21] [Music]
[11:22] away to
[11:26] do. Amen. Because as child of
[11:30] God, masters all circumstances.
[11:36] Amen. You will never find him cornered
[11:38] somewhere.
[11:42] Always living and always
[11:44] on
[11:46] foot on his feet.
[11:49] Amen. Amen.
[11:52] So his wife is not
[11:56] wanting. She receives all
[12:01] things from him.
[12:05] Amen.
[12:07] Then in closing, the Lord willing,
[12:14] uh here is the secret. Now
[12:17] the weight is in the
[12:21] bride.
[12:24] Here is the
[12:29] the secret is
[12:32] the word is in the bride.
[12:37] That is the the
[12:43] secret. If it's not in the bride,
[12:48] it's not a secret.
[12:51] But it it's a
[12:53] secret when it is in
[12:59] the secret when it was in
[13:05] him. Amen. Amen. And the secret that was
[13:09] in
[13:10] him as the husband, he
[13:14] transferred his mind to
[13:19] the because your
[13:24] wife should
[13:26] know what you your
[13:31] dislikes and the things you like.
[13:35] Otherwise,
[13:39] it will contradict
[13:44] she knows
[13:46] that my husband don't like
[13:48] this. My husband don't eat
[13:51] this. Amen. Amen. My husband don't want
[13:54] this to be done like
[13:57] this. My husband don't My husband likes
[14:01] this.
[14:02] Now the bride of Christ knows very well
[14:08] my husband
[14:12] don't like don't establish
[14:17] denominations that is the wife
[14:22] now my husband
[14:25] don't ordain women pre women women
[14:27] pastors
[14:32] my husband.
[14:34] Amen. Amen. That does the wife.
[14:39] The knowledge of the
[14:41] husband passed on the wife.
[14:45] Now she speaks the same
[14:49] language. My husband won't bless a
[14:55] denomination. So she knows about the
[14:58] husband.
[15:03] That's how there's a
[15:06] harmony because she knows how to to
[15:09] serve her
[15:14] husband. Amen. Now in other words, while
[15:19] the husband knows her
[15:22] wife, the wife knows the husband.
[15:27] Now they can exchange
[15:31] things pleasing one
[15:33] another. I'm talking about Christ and
[15:35] the
[15:38] body. Amen. Amen. A church in harmony
[15:41] with
[15:44] Christ and exchange with
[15:48] Christ. She will never contradict
[15:51] him. He is the head of the body.
[15:56] Amen. Amen.
[15:58] Look what this uh uh uh um uh
[16:03] uh political 50 50/50 has done
[16:10] now50. Look what happened in their
[16:14] homes. Some are
[16:16] breaking and so
[16:18] forth. That is a political 50/50.
[16:24] breaks the harmony.
[16:29] Amen.
[16:31] Uh because
[16:32] now you are reading they
[16:35] say 300 rand for spanking a
[16:43] child breaking the harmony between the
[16:46] parent and the child.
[16:51] You know what is
[16:56] spanking? So now your child
[16:58] now just for doing
[17:04] this mother has beaten
[17:07] me
[17:09] speaking now I don't know what what are
[17:12] they going to do
[17:14] now because when a child is delivered
[17:17] from the mother
[17:20] spanking done
[17:25] on whether they are going to sue the
[17:29] midwife or
[17:32] what? Are they going to sue the
[17:36] midwife that
[17:41] baby? Yeah, these are politics.
[17:48] need a
[17:49] strong con constituency.
[17:53] Hallelujah. They they need a strong
[17:55] constituent. They want to be voted in.
[18:01] If now there's
[18:03] a All right, let me stop there for
[18:06] later. Let me read here. Here is the
[18:08] secret.
[18:10] The word is in
[18:14] the Amen. Not with the bride
[18:20] in the bride because there is some some
[18:24] somewhere where the word is with the
[18:26] people.
[18:30] [Music]
[18:32] The Bible says they were Pharisees and
[18:35] scribes and so
[18:37] forth and the power of God was there to
[18:40] heal
[18:42] them. The power
[18:46] But the power couldn't heal them.
[18:51] Why?
[18:52] Because they didn't believe.
[18:57] But the power was
[19:01] there. Amen. The power is here to heal
[19:04] you.
[19:08] You don't even need to be prayed
[19:11] for. No. The power is here to heal you.
[19:17] But only if you recognize
[19:22] it. I've seen people getting
[19:27] healed in the
[19:29] tabernacle and elsewhere where we
[19:32] went. Amen. Amen. Without this system of
[19:37] laying of
[19:39] hands, I've seen them getting healed.
[19:42] [Music]
[19:43] said, "While the weather was
[19:45] [Music]
[19:47] coming, I felt power in my
[19:51] body and gone was my
[19:54] disease." I I can produce some people
[19:58] to give you a testimony.
[20:03] Amen. Amen. Here is the
[20:06] secret because the word is a healer.
[20:12] You receive the
[20:15] weight, you are healed.
[20:21] Only if you receive
[20:24] the
[20:26] word. That soldier said, "You need not
[20:30] to come to my
[20:33] house. Speak the
[20:37] word." Amen. Just speak the
[20:40] word. And the Lord said, "Even in
[20:45] Israel, I've never seen
[20:52] speak the word."
[20:56] And
[20:58] Peter, he found them
[21:01] there. The whole
[21:03] night trying to catch
[21:05] fish and they caught
[21:08] nothing. And he said to them, they said,
[21:11] "Lord, we tried to draw the whole
[21:16] night." And he said, "Cast your
[21:21] net
[21:24] deep." And Peter said, "We have tried
[21:27] the whole
[21:28] night, but by your
[21:31] word, we will do
[21:34] it according to your word."
[21:37] So they cast their
[21:39] nets and they
[21:42] draw many
[21:45] fish. Even the the nets
[21:50] break. Amen. They broke
[21:54] because that was they've done it in his
[21:58] word.
[21:59] [Music]
[22:04] If you want to go some places in God.
[22:11] Amen. Amen.
[22:14] And your pocket will your purse will
[22:17] never go dry
[22:20] as long as you do it.
[22:29] As long as it's for him,
[22:34] Amen. you you keep that in your
[22:40] heart. Give Elijah
[22:47] said, "Amen." Amen.
[22:51] And she had the last two
[22:57] But the prophet came and
[23:00] said, "Give it to me first."
[23:06] Give it to God
[23:10] first. Amen. Amen. And all these other
[23:14] things
[23:16] shall be added unto
[23:19] you. Give it to God
[23:21] first.
[23:23] Here is the secret. The word is in the
[23:29] bride. And the mind of Christ to know
[23:32] what he wants
[23:36] done with the
[23:39] word. Now listen
[23:41] carefully. The word here is the secret.
[23:47] You know Mary had the secret.
[23:52] And there were critics around that
[23:54] secret.
[23:57] [Applause]
[23:59] You see
[24:00] now, did you hear of any
[24:05] wedding? But look at
[24:08] her. God just
[24:14] kept there's a man.
[24:17] He came to my house with another pastor.
[24:20] is a
[24:23] pastor. So um we were speaking on terms
[24:27] of ordaining women and that and
[24:33] that. So he was so furious because he
[24:37] has done it
[24:41] already. He's known in the
[24:45] cycles. He has pastor Selena there.
[24:53] [Music]
[24:58] there. So
[25:00] now he was in in
[25:04] trouble trying to sell that to
[25:07] me. So I said, "Uh uh pastor,
[25:12] give me a
[25:16] scripture I can a scripture that I can
[25:19] use
[25:22] when ordaining a sister for our
[25:26] pastorship." Then he said, "You
[25:30] see in the old
[25:32] Jewish culture."
[25:36] So I said, "No, no, no,
[25:39] pastor. I am a common
[25:44] believer. I'm not used to those Jewish
[25:49] culture. I'm just a common
[25:52] believer. Show me in the Bible.
[25:58] then I will do it
[26:02] and
[26:12] [Music]
