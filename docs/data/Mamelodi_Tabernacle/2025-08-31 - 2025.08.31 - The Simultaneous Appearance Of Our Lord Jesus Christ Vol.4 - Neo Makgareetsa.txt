Basal and then we sing our song as he is preparing to come up for and God bless him. Amen. might [Music] &gt;&gt; when he [Music] begin to sound the street of All should be finished as he has declared to his prophet. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet. more than great and dreadful day. Then he shall the heart of their fathers to their children. and the heart of their children to their fathers. [Music] Bless I come. Bless I come and smile [Music] again. and welcome. [Music] Holy Ghost we welcome [Music] with power [Music] Be well. &gt;&gt; Welcome. [Music] &gt;&gt; Welcome. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost with power. &gt;&gt; Come with power. his power. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost, we welcome thee. I I greet you all this morning in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I believe God is still good to our life. He is the same yesterday, today and forever. As long as there's a breath in our lungs, We will keep on worshiping him even this morning. We will share the will of God to keep the wheel turning. Amen. Amen. I have the greetings from our pastor again this morning. [Music] He said, "I must tell you that [Music] he's okay. He's just in a recovering mode. He will see. He will see you sooner. Just keep on praying for him. He He's praying for you as well." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I saw him praying for the people while he was at the hospital. Then I realized the only thing that the pastor knows is nothing but the word of God. I have testimonies as well. what sister do was saying the previous week. I'm the eyewitness. I've seen everything and how God does things. Um when brother Brenam was at the hospital, it happened that he departed. &gt;&gt; Amen. He departed with our feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then brother Perry Green, &gt;&gt; brother Perry Green &gt;&gt; has to call Billy Paul &gt;&gt; telling him that your father is dead. Then Bill was just looking at brother Perry. Then brother Perry realized that there's a problem with Bill. I have to do something about he gave him &gt;&gt; a hot clap. You know why? If he didn't do that, Billy Paul was going to be dramatized his entire life. There are certain things in life when they happen you don't feel the pain but maybe after 10 or 15 years comes that hot was to make Bill Paul to face the reality to to get shock talk of a little bit that moment so that tomorrow he will be fine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I I've seen that when we were at the with the pastor at the hospital, the doctors, the nurses said they don't understand what kind of a being he is. When he come out of the theater, [Music] he was as normal as he was going into the I saw Indian doctors. You you see those with some red wools here asking the prayers from the pastor while he is in the hospital. Then I said it's something else. Amen. Amen. So we they they see something that they haven't seen before. I'm telling you when we were there &gt;&gt; just to give you briefly &gt;&gt; but sister do said it all. Oh, maybe sit down for a few seconds. Uh when I was entering where the pastor was sitting, he called me. &gt;&gt; Then he said to me, "Hey, Bruce, is the program ready?" I said, "Yeah, pastor, everything is fine." Pastor Mua preached Sundays preaching and the program is fine. Then he he laughed at me. He said, "Hey, you don't understand, bro. Jesus is here to take me back home. I mean funeral program." Then I was shaking. I said, "No, pastor. that one we can't do because you are here. He said yes, but I'm here beating you goodbye. &gt;&gt; Jesus is here to take me home. I feel like this one is above me now. I don't know how coming in stand on the other side of the beach. I was on this side in the middle and then they beyond me. &gt;&gt; I said now the pastor is talking things. Then listen to the pastor again. When he was saying I'm going then said to him when you come here you were alive. When you leave this hospital, you will be alive. I'm not going to allow that we should take you out of the hospital with a coffin. She said it boldly. Then I was just there folding my arms. That was the 22nd of July. 22 July. Then the the hours passed by while we were sitting. We just saw the nurses throwing their scene and their bags and everything. We sang youced. That time the pastor was gone to glory. And then later there was laughter in the room and they called the family. They say you are dead was gone. The machine was off. But after he came back things were like just normal. Then those that are in the medical department or the medical field rather They say if someone was like that he won't be like the same for the whole week. Maybe will recover later but after that things were normal in the machines. Things comes to normal again and then we even talk like nothing happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it just came to my mind that God is doing something here because we sometimes preach and when we preach but when the reality come is like we didn't preach because when we face the reality we start to shake. Something came to me and say when we preach about Joshua, Joshua, Joshua is one man whom was sent by God or Moses to the promised land and come back with the fruits of the land. Then I say, but we also preach pastors are Joshua. Means our pastor is Joshua. Meaning somewhere somehow he has to go to the promised land and come back with the fruit of the lamb. So pastor went to glory land and come back with the fruit of the lamb. So time passed by we were sitting I visited him 11:00 in the morning in a private place where he was. Then he said to me, "Ruth, I I see things and I've seen things. God has shown me a lot of things. I even saw I tremble again. &gt;&gt; Then he look at me. You say, "Why does it look like you're afraid?" You can't say, "Yes, I'm afraid." You just say, "Don't worry. I saw you there with your family." Amen. I said, "Oh, ah, this day I will never forget. &gt;&gt; Why are we coming to the service every day? When the reality comes, we we tremble. We are here to see ourselves &gt;&gt; in the rapture because the rapture is the first journey that take us to the new Jerusalem. So if the pastor said he saw us there is the done deal. So when I walk, who is in the rapture? This one is in the rapture and you were there because the pastor said, I saw rapture the children of God going up. But luckily, he said to me, I was there. So I I no longer worry about the things of the world. Everything that is happening to me, God knows about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anything that is happening to you, God knows about you. You don't have a a right to worry this morning. Don't worry. God never made a mistake. Everything is pre-planned. You must just walk on the path that God has prepared for you. And that's all. Amen. Amen. When things are not going your way, God knows why. Wait upon him at the right time. You will know why. There are certain things you do not understand but God understand. So you just relax upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are not worshiping in vain. No no no no. You worship because you are a worshipper to begin with. &gt;&gt; This morning I want to continue with that message of millennium and preach half of it and the remaining half we will finish it today. But because it was a women's month, I God gave me the message about the encouraging our sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I had part two of that message of women of valor, but God did not allow me to preach it today. is the last day of the month because men can hate you. men. You know in life when you preach that kind of a message and a brother tried to do something in the house. [Music] Put the message of the woman of Bala while you are still trying to wash the car. Sister say the word of God comes first. &gt;&gt; What she mean that sit and listen. &gt;&gt; It's life. &gt;&gt; Let's enjoy life. &gt;&gt; Same thing. If you can preach and be hard on women, brother will will go to the sister and brother will go to the sister. &gt;&gt; You must say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's on the other side. When it's on the it's it's life. Let's just enjoy life. This is the word of God. It's for men. It's for women. It's for youth. and it goes all part so that we can grow in the word of God. Don't be angry. Just say God you know better. And if the message is talking about you rectifying you, thank you God. Because one man who did not thank God for the message that came to him was Kane was Kane. I hope we don't have Kane this morning, but we have people from the lineage of Abel and said, you know, until today, let's enjoy the word of God. And I normally those that normally talk to me, I normally said to them, if you have problems, just be like myself. Even if you can make me angry, I just rejoice. &gt;&gt; If you can hate me, I will love you more. &gt;&gt; I don't worry. &gt;&gt; Or is anyone of you who said I hate him because of one there's no one. That is why as children of God, let's impart love. Because the Bible says, "Love until you love your own enemy." Jesus looked at the young rich man and loved him. &gt;&gt; Though he rejected the message, he just loved him. Those that hate you, just love them because you are love and God is love. Let's stand to our feet. I love this hymn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we enjoy the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Oh god, I see a beyond. [Music] [Applause] [Music] God. [Applause] Oh He's all [Music] in the morning. [Music] You want to see [Music] what I want. [Music] Let's bow our heads and pray. &gt;&gt; Gracious and eternal father, we are thankful this morning for breaking the eyes. We know Lord God for us to leave our house to come to the temple is not an easy way. But heavenly father here we are this morning &gt;&gt; with the great anticipation &gt;&gt; because we want to hear from above. &gt;&gt; We know Lord God this morning when we come there are those that are weary and afflated Lord God. May you help us Lord as this word is coming forth &gt;&gt; so that the way we came to the church should not be the same as we are going home &gt;&gt; because you'll be talking to us in a special way &gt;&gt; and one thing I know about Lord God you never disappointed us &gt;&gt; everything that is happening in our life &gt;&gt; you know them but as human being we may think otherwise but you know better We are going to read the portion of the scripture from that scripture Lord and the quote from the prophet and our lives &gt;&gt; should always look up to thee because you are the only absolute in our lives. &gt;&gt; I'm just a vessel this morning Lord God with our precious brother harst. Lord God &gt;&gt; do as you do all the time &gt;&gt; as we talk heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the heaven speak through us to your children. &gt;&gt; For we only need a comfort from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we love you so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you first love us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Talk to us this morning, Lord God. &gt;&gt; As we believe in thy word and believe everything uh good and well unto your capable hands in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's open it in the book of uh Isaiah chapter 65 verse 21 only. &gt;&gt; It reads as follows. Isaiah 65:21. And they shall build houses and inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let's go to Revelation 20, &gt;&gt; verse 1-3. Revelation 21-3. And I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; And after that he must be loosed a little season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; We we we continue about this thousand years, a millennium because it's time and we are still on time. Amen. Amen. So, we were talking about us in the previous message about the millennium when we get there and live there. But I never said anything about the Jewish unbelievers and the foolish vision. So, I want us to take that part so that it can be concluded. Amen. Amen. Well, brother Brennham says on the message called scriptural sign of the time, I will read, God gave Solomon a gift and all the whole church. Everybody believed it. That was a millennium for the Jews. That was the Old Testament millennium in the days of Solomon. A foreshadow of the millennium to come. The golden age of the Jews. Notice nobody started war with them. They feared them because they know their God was real. Because they had him in their presence and the people was all one heart and one accord. Why the fame went everywhere everywhere and you hear what a great thing God of Israel a living God. I I always say or is the Bible and brother Benam is teaching us that a journey of Israelites &gt;&gt; naturally is our age and the age we are living in or the life we are living for the bride supernaturally are the same. their natural journey is like unto our spiritual journey. If they had their millennium, we will have our millennium. Millennium was 40 years. Millennium. Our millennium is thousand years. God has honored us so much. He gave us a thousand years in the millennia. As Adam was in the Garden of Eden, he was supposed to live there for a thousand years, but he couldn't complete it. But we shall complete it because God is honoring us. If that was the golden age of the Jewish, it will be our golden age in the beginning. We think of this Solomon in that great millennium of the Jewish &gt;&gt; that when no nation dare to touch them and that great gift of God was in the prophet till he made known to the queen of all of her secrets of her heart. Nothing was withheld the great age showing and typing that there was a great age coming. The great age that is coming. They were brother Ben is referring to us. Amen. Amen. Now that was what happened during the time of the Jewish with their millennium. Now our message start with this quote &gt;&gt; from the exposition of the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. &gt;&gt; It is the second resurrection where the five foolish visions come out. noticed that they were vigils. They did not have Holy Spirit. So they miss being in the bride. While the five wise who had oil became part of that bride. But these people being separated, God loving people and I want to say let's let's repeat it. &gt;&gt; But these people being separated, God loving people. No, no. In fact, it's Yes. Amen. And trying to abide in the way. Indeed, &gt;&gt; according to what they knew of it, and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end of time, but they will miss millennia, which you can begin to see by this truth is much more important. and wonderful than we have ever thought or believe. Our Lord Jesus Christ was giving an example about the 10 visions. The five that had oil in their lamp and the other five did not had oil in their lamp. They did not have the Holy Spirit. So the five saw the groom, but the other five couldn't see the groom. That's what brother Abraham is talking about this morning. You were the five visions that saw the groom, the one that had the Holy Spirit, the oil in their lamp. But there are people out there, very people, God loving people. You you see they are trying to abide the word of God, but they will never be in the millennium. And you will be in the millennium. You will be in the millennium because you know the word of God better than them. But it is because he loved you before the foundation. He chose you before the foundation of the world. If God did chose you, you don't have a right to boast. You don't have a right to belittle others. Just humble yourself and remain a child of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are people out there that dress more perfect than our sisters, but they will never be in the millennia. Those that will be in the millennia is the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. whom he chose unconditionally. &gt;&gt; The unconditional love of God abide in us. He just loved us. Amen. Amen. It's like when choosing a wife, you just look at her and your heart tells you this is the one. When you choose her, you chose her forever. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No comment. &gt;&gt; Be honest with me this morning. Many people want exit in their marriages. When when we say when I say be honest with me, I want to ask you this question. How would we be if Christ our groom one of the day said to us, I need an exit in this marriage. &gt;&gt; So who are we taking after? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when you love someone unconditionally, he can she can shout at you. You just look at him, I love you so much. Be honest with me. You sometimes lie. You are quiet because you think you are not lying. You sometimes lie. You sometimes take the offering, sometimes do things contrary to the word of God. But Jesus just look at you and say, "I love you." [Applause] Why? You have faith or or you are you are real you. Behold the face of the father. He looks at you from what is in front of him irrespective of your condition. He will never propose and exit method in the marriage that he has with you. [Applause] The Bible says The one that used to report used report you to him, he does not have that chance again. &gt;&gt; The devil does not have access to the sixth dimension nor seven dimension anymore. He will come from the fifth dimension to this world and go to the fifth dimension to this world. But a child of God can go to the fifth dimension to the sixth dimension to all the dimension because God has give us the access to hell death heaven as a child of God but the devil doesn't have an access that is why our pastor can go die and come back and say we'll go together because I have seen what is happening in glory land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you miss rapture, if you miss rapture, you will not be in the millennia. The rapture. It's a carrier to the millennium. Once you are in the millennium, it's not a rest place. You are in the journey to the new city that is eternal. If you can miss rapture, you'll never be in the millennium. That is why the foolish vision will miss rapture. That is why they will not be part of the bride in the new millennium. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But this vision one of the days God will really bear for them. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not the message for today. When we go after white throne judgment, you will see. But today is about millennia. Now they ask brother a question when the millennium start. How will the unbeliever be taken off of the earth? The unbelievers will go down in the tribulation period with the sleeping vision. They will go through the tribulation. Those sleeping visions with the unbelievers will go through the tribulation. and all those unbelievers and sleeping vision and the remnant of Israel &gt;&gt; that's to be taken out. So meaning when we raptured &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; will be with Israel revealing himself that when they crucify him they were crucifying their savior but it was done purposely so that Jesus can come in for his bride. When that is happening, spontaneously the Gentiles will be in tribulation. That same time, the bride will be raptured. Now, when we have raptured for the three and a half years going into the millennium, when we are in the millennium, we will be with him. But now we are not with him. Him in us. He is in us. But in the millennium, he will be with us. We will see him. He will see us. Then God in us now is God with us in the millennium telling us all the secret. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That you know what we are in a journey for thousand years. I honor you for abiding my way. We will be with him for thousand years. But the unbelievers and the sleeping vision will not be in the millennium. Where will the Jew be? 144 years will be in the millennium with us. But not the bride. There will not be the bride. It will be the king and the queen and the servants. That's what will will be happening in the millennium. You see the Jewish now they have all what the world needs naturally. We do not have we are poor. We don't have those money. We don't have those gold and diamonds because God never called us for such. But come rapture, come millennium, those that we are saving today, they will be the one to save us. Amen. Amen. So from that time after rapture we will be the real queen of the king that that is the plan of God about us. So nothing will be left undone. Unbelievers having their position. Foolish visions having their position. Jewish having their position and us as well having our position. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. Notice the millennium reign, the thousand years is not the new earth. &gt;&gt; The millennium reign is a different reign. That's what we go into. the millennium, but that is not the new earth or the new heaven. No, no, &gt;&gt; that's just the rest place. See, the rest period, not all the new heaven and the new earth for you. See, in the millennium, we have things that will not go into that in the new heaven and the new earth. It's a time, old seventh day out at Eden. The seventh day after he made the world, the seventh day, he rested in Eden. and the millennium. &gt;&gt; So the millennium is just a rest day while we are in the jail. Don't be in hard. Amen. We are not expecting the rapture because we have many deps. We just need to pay our debt while we are going. &gt;&gt; Don't be angry. When is this thing rapture coming? They shouldn't tire you. We should just pay it while waiting for the Lord because the Lord comes at the time that he will come. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, the world has now almost 6,000 years. Every 2,000 years is a destruction. The first 2,000, the flood came and he baptized this world with water. The next 2,000 years, Jesus come to sanctify it and claim it, drop his blood upon it, call it his. Amen. All right. From where they spared him, that's where we came from. That's where we were born. Thank God because the Bible says the lamb was slain before the foundation. Meaning everything was done. This is just the moment of manifestation and that's it. That's why I'll keep on saying relax in the will of God is has done everything. He has done everything. Don't even try to say I want to try. I want to live right now. God has done it. If you are not a child of God, you will try and even go to hell. You know a prodigal son who just left the father's house. and go to the foreign land. But one of the days he remembered that I have a father. I need to go back to my father. I cannot continue eating with him. When the father sees him from far away, he said my son who was dead is alive. He embraced him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. slaughter a cow and you know it was a feast day gave him a new robe. They say his elder brother was not happy about it. If a a a sinner, come to God. Heaven rejoice but others got angry. Check your spirit because that man said no. He took his portion and take it away and eat everything. I was remaining with you father. I'm responsible son. He is responsible. He is responsible. But the father said he is my son. You are my son. Everything in the house belongs to you. Everything in the father belongs to you. Everything in the house belongs to the wife &gt;&gt; and the kids. I've seen disaster. I've seen disasters. When men died, you go to the wheel and check what's happening. You see in the wheel, a man put his mother and his siblings, the wife and the kids are not there. Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, I've seen it. Why did you get married to begin with? And I'm asking a question again. How do you feel if one day you check the will of our Lord Jesus Christ? You are not there in the will of our Lord Jesus Christ. We see the bride of Jesus Christ. So if you do such &gt;&gt; who are you taking after &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We let's just I always say but for sure by now you see I am a man who loves families I want to see peace in the families and the families living nice our kids nice. I'm not saying there will be no shouting in the house. We shouting and after shouting we laugh at the devil because the work of the devil, brother Benham says, is to torment the family. The devil doesn't like families fight in the families so happy. But I want to tell you, let's shame the devil. [Applause] I'll come again now as king with his queen and the second 2,000 years does he do? He comes and give his period and then bends her off and claim it for his own. put his own back on it. I I'm I'm always following this war on Russia and Ukraine America and you will realize that is true when brother Brennham says of the devil. I I was listening to Trump &gt;&gt; saying to Zalinski, &gt;&gt; "Yes, we sold weapon to you, but those weapons that don't throw them inside Russia, why did I buy to begin with?" Ukraine &gt;&gt; spent billions to buy weapons. missiles and everything from America. But America said, "Don't use them. You will use them the day we tell you to sil this doesn't make sense. I throw." He throw one missile in Russia and blow their substation. [Music] Russia responded with more than 600 drone 1,000 people &gt;&gt; in Ukraine &gt;&gt; in one day. Then Trump came and say I told you that's politic. That is why when Russia speak is not threatening they do what they believe. I was listening to the minister of forign affairs of Russia. They call him Sergey Lavro something like that. He was interviewed by NBC journalist. &gt;&gt; Then he said, "You Russian, &gt;&gt; you want to own the entire world. want to take all the territories. Then he responded to the journalist and said, "I wish you know, but you know nothing because &gt;&gt; Russia &gt;&gt; used to be USSR, &gt;&gt; USSR, &gt;&gt; Union Soviet Socialist Republic, &gt;&gt; but we move from there. &gt;&gt; We are Russia. &gt;&gt; Even Alaska you are boasting about was Russia. &gt;&gt; Even Ukraine you are talking about was Russia and Russia &gt;&gt; is the largest continent in the world. We just want to live in peace but if you touch us we will respond harshly. He said I was listening to him. He said the only thing that we need. We don't want to fight UK but the only thing we need because it's one of our land they must not our enemies if they accept our enemies we will deal with them harshly. Did you know that when Putin &gt;&gt; was talking with Trump &gt;&gt; in Alaska about peace, they were busy bombing Ukraine, but they were talking peace. Then the Bible said it's true. When they say peace, peace, destruction will come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Brenham said during his time was &gt;&gt; and they met couldn't agree. Do you know today Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin &gt;&gt; they met couldn't agree. America will never agree with Russia because the Bible says right at the end it's iron &gt;&gt; and clay iron and clay is Russia and America they will never agree. That is why at the end third world war when the NATO tried to speak Putin is just say try you can talk but you try throw one missile I finished the whole world now that is true I'm saying that because here brother Brenham says last here and he burns her off this world. How he's going to burn it off. Those missiles from Russia. I was reading again this kind of missile they make. They say that missile does not need to hit the building. It just go up. When it comes down at a certain level, explode and on that explode is thousand and thousand more hotter than the sun. the people in that city, they just die. &gt;&gt; That's how they're going to finish this world. &gt;&gt; And it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; So, America &gt;&gt; knows Russia is capable of that, but it need to be wiped off because the Bible says so. Let's continue. And notice not the perfect world. It's millennium. It's a type of the seventh day. There comes the white throne judgment. We still have judgment. It's still in time in the millennium. It's a day a thousand years. It's a time element. No, don't get that mixed up with the because it's not the new earth eternal but the millennium the day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice seven days only has to do with the old creation. World time. Seven days is the millennium the rest day as God labored six days rested the seventh church labor six days and rest the seventh but you still in the time element I ain't speaking of the eternal but you see there's no such a thing as eight days. You go back to the first day again. See the first day. So the first day is a millennium. I mean the seventh day is the millennium where we rest. But the eighth day is the new earth. It's the new heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you can see yourself &gt;&gt; in rapture, &gt;&gt; then you will be in the millennium. After the millennium when the sin come again because we are still in time, you will be on the side of our Lord Jesus Christ. After death, you will go in the white throat judgment. You are not going to be just but you will be the judge. Then after that we go to the new Jerusalem and it's eternal. We are going there but now we in a millennia. The Sabbath speaks of the old law which was to pass away. The keeping of Sabbath which passed away or I have said or changed to another. Amen. It just changed from old law keeping a certain day of the week. That is the Sabbath, the day of rest. So if you rest for one day, the people trying to keep them following the Jewish, you know, tradition. But God has done our Sabbath as the millennium for a thousand years. He He loved us so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. For a thousand years, &gt;&gt; we will be with him. But for 40 years, he was with the Jewish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in the millennium &gt;&gt; as we read Isaiah 65 the Bible says we will build house and inhabit them. &gt;&gt; Amen. For a thousand years. Where did you ever find such things? Is because God is honoring us. &gt;&gt; Let me read this again. Question and answers. &gt;&gt; Amen. God made the world in 6,000 years. 7,000 he rested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Amen will never leave that time. The day you eat thereof, you shall die." That is why Adam couldn't me. lived 969 years. &gt;&gt; He never lived 2,000 years. But the man that's going to live through the millennium 1,000 years to show that the penalty &gt;&gt; has been paid. Man lives forever. The day is finished. The time is finished. They are in eternity. All the things that happens in the new test in the Old Testament were leading to our Lord Jesus Christ. The one that the Bible is talking about. He redeemed us. He made us who we are today. That is why he was supposed to die on the cross by his blood. All our sins are forgiven. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If the Old Testament people failed, God himself came down and taste death out of death. Here we are this morning. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God loved David so much when he talks about the kings in Israel. the kings in Israel all of them. But he speak about David in a special way. Listen to this. &gt;&gt; Solomon was the son of David. &gt;&gt; Then God honored David bring millennium in Israel during the time of the son of David being Solomon naturally. Amen. Amen. And God again is honoring David in another millennium that will be ruled by the son of David being our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. The millennium &gt;&gt; for the Jewish was for the son of David. The millennium for the bride was for the son of David. So Jesus Christ is the spiritual son of David. Solomon, the physical son of David. God loved David so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it's a question. If time seizes when the seals were open, if time sees when the seals were open, then the millennium is also finished. Is it not? It's a question answer and say no. Time didn't seize when the sins were open. Misunderstood it. Okay. What happened? The mysteries was revealed. Not time ceased. Just look. You know, brother was teaching us here that the sins was revealing something but was not stopping time. The time will go because now we are still on time. Rapture is time. Millennium is time. Gog and Magog is time. White throne judgment. Eternity is not time. So the seals came to reveal dead. But the time is going. Time never ceased until the post millennialist. Amen. Amen. After the millennium, that's when time will see but now still in time. Now the millennium is not the new heavens and the new earth will still be seen after the millennium. There will still be sin after the millennium. You know why you die sinner. You wake up sinner. You die a child of God. You wake up a child of God. You will see when we get to go and make the millennium. That time during the millennium by the chain of circumstance there was no one &gt;&gt; to deceive. Then God will allow them to rise. When they rise they will try to fight you to fight Mik. that war of revelation 12 amen comes again Lucifer his angel his angel they will fight again that's when he will wipe off all of them is time as amen so when you arrive &gt;&gt; you will be rising like the way you are. You die a sinner, you wake up a sinner. You die a child of God, you will rise a child. I if you fight someone, he defeated you. Next time when you meet him and realizing that you won't win him again, he will surrender. But the devil and his angel when they rise again they forgot that is God who raised them. They will say you fought us last time. You defeated us but not this time. That's a blind man &gt;&gt; and that will be the end of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Enoch, the translated one, was a type of the bride that went up, not the one that was carried over. So sin will still be on the other side of the millennium because sin is unbelief. The people even after death, they will disbelieve the word of God. because they were made to disbelieve. But not during the millennium. During the millennium is peace. During the time of Solomon was peace. During the time of the millennium will be peace. But still will be dealt with on the other side of the millennium and then time will fade. So you see we are in a journey. When you are a child of God, you for sure you know that you are a child of God to begin with a child of God today. You will be the child of God tomorrow and we are going to the new city you will be a child of God. That is why in the rapture when you get into the rapture or when you rapture being a child of God you are not you are quite sure that from here until eternity I will remain like this. Lord Jesus Christ is not like us because one day I attended a wedding young brother and a sister we agree on the marriage in the courtship they promising one another this and that and so forth. But the Friday evening when we get to the wedding they divorce each other already. But they said because we invited people, let them just come and eat, the pastor was there officiating false vow because they knew each other. Kiss the bride, Saturday evening. The other one goes there, the other goes there. I attended that wedding. learning how to live. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then I I I spoke with a brother. &gt;&gt; He's my friend. I said, "Bru, how did you manage to get this right?" [Music] He said, "I didn't have a choice. We disagree until we just say come eat and go home. And even this wife I'm I'm getting married to is taken this way taking this way. I'm not lying to you. It happened even today. They are not together since that day of the wedding. But &gt;&gt; who are they taking after? &gt;&gt; When Christ married us, irrespective of the condition that comes our way, he will never leave us. We have many reasons to leave our wives and not many reason to stay with them. If God can be angry and say, "I don't want you anymore. Can I be honest with you?" None of you here will survive. None of you. As long as you are still wearing this flesh, you will never survive. What makes us survive? The inner man. The man that is perfect is the one that God is looking at. But this one after service will go out here. Some will be griefed. But after hearing this message [Music] is the flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now we we continue. &gt;&gt; Does the millennium &gt;&gt; have to do with the 1,000 years? &gt;&gt; Could it not be a generation? Amen. Brother respond. A generation allotted in the Bible. 40 years. That's natural. The generation and that 40 years was the age allotted to Israel. But the Bible says and they lived and reigned with Christ, thousand years. It will be 1,000 years upon the earth. The millennium will be in this earth. Are we together? For we will build houses and inhabit them because 1,000 years upon the earth is only counted a time for a parallel parable like God as one day. 1,00 years upon on the earth is only one day with God as God concounting time. How many understand that? I believe children of God understand. So does the Sabbath day when the church will no more labor against sin? There's a time coming where will you will not labor against seed. But now we are laboring against sin. Come millennia, we will not labor against all of us. We believe one God, one accord. The church &gt;&gt; might be as full as it is in this world, but it does not guarantee that will be all in the middle. For the Bible says, not all Israel wise, not all message believers. That is why God in our time is dealing with us individually. I don't care what you do. I just believe in God myself alone. If you have another idea is up to you. Not all the people that are in the message believe the message. Maybe you must not believe the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you must not believe the message. must be the message. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And Satan is binded for a little season, a thousand years because his subject is all in hell. The church that's on earth is redeemed and right in the the presence of Christ. So he has nothing he can work on. So it's not a chain as I said a lock chain it's a chain of circumstances &gt;&gt; just waiting for the resurrection of the subject then they separated as sheep from the goat. You see we are in a journey. There will be a time where people will see will be separated a sheep from the goat. That is why in the message it's an individual thing. The people can make you hate other people. If you don't know your stand, you will hate. Now I repeat, I love until I love my enemies. If you hate me this morning, know that I love you. Then come David. He was going to reflect the the great millennium &gt;&gt; in David. He was going to show what king was and God saw by David. Amen. Amen. He will rise up his son seat on the throne. And David was such a gallant man till he was a man after God's And David was doing good. He smoked all the Philistine tore down their altars to stay with the way. And finally the pretty woman upset him. He and he and he broke the commandment, &gt;&gt; lost the weight. committed adultery. See a man after his own heart. Still David failed him. After David fail him, God look at David is a man after his own heart. God is not like us. If someone can fail you, It's because you are a human being. You are not like God. If someone has failed you, God look at what before he devil does not have access to the children of God anymore. Moses failed him. All the rest of them failed him. But all their lives were just reflection of the one that was to come. &gt;&gt; All those new old testament people they were failing him because they were human beings. But when Christ Jesus come, he was perfect. He wanted a perfect thing and we are the perfect bride of God. That's why when he come he said bride you are sinless. You are spotless. That is why when brother come he look at you and say I see you there. &gt;&gt; If brother Brennan says I see you there is a complete thing. What is happening? What is going on? Show us there. [Music] &gt;&gt; A soldier in the battle will fight. If they shoot your foot, you fall down. You rise limp. Shoot the devil. Shoot the enemy. You don't fall and sleep. This thing of the message. The next thing But a soldier will keep on soldiering on a soldier will die having the sword in his hand. Brothers and sisters, never give up. [Applause] Keep on soldiering on. There's a crown for you. Let me read from Satan's Eden. Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Remember here not long ago I was teaching you on the seven trumpets, the feast of the trumpet. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so forth. And I say there's a 8th day festival festival. Eighth day, first the seventh day will be the last that will be the millennium. &gt;&gt; Amen. The seventh day is the millennium. When you go to the eighth one, it's eternity. But there's eighth day festival. It was the eighth and there's only seven days. We'll make it the first day again. Come right back to the first day. Then after the millennium is over and there will be established Eden again. The millennium &gt;&gt; is in Eden. God's great kingdom will be taken because Jesus because Jesus fought it out with Satan in the garden of heaven and won it back the which he's going to prepare in heaven to return again up in heaven. He said, "Let not your heart be troubled." If Eden, &gt;&gt; that's where a man failed in Kaman. That's where a man conquer because our Lord Jesus Christ was hanging on the cross. that thinking is the end of him and this is the beginning. [Applause] [Music] That's where we were born. When he was crucified in Gethru by so doing he was taking us back where we failed. He was taking us back in the garden of Eden to show that our battle is his battle. We we we we can't help ourselves. We can't defeat the devil. The only time we can defeat him is to accept what happened in man. Try yourself. You failed. Don't Don't try to fight physical war. Don't try to say this person has done this this and try physically. You will fail. But if you try it, we know that you are a serpent seat. They fight physically. The only seat that fight physically &gt;&gt; is the serpent seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that the history is closing out. &gt;&gt; The world history will be soon over. &gt;&gt; Then we're going to step into a new day. Great millennium. That's as one believer in a millennium, a millennium reign with Christ, thousand years upon the earth. That is the physical return of the Lord Jesus to take a physical people glorified by his cleansing blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where you know him. That's where you see him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But in the millennium in the physical return of the Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; you are is no longer in him. He's no longer in us. He's with us. We see him. Then we talk, we respond. He talk to us, we respond. where in the millennia &gt;&gt; his physical being was raised up to the throne of God where the spirit was on the throne. Now Christ is on the throne. Jesus a little while and the world see me no more yet you shall see for I'll be with you to the end of the world in you the throne of of God of Christ is erected in your heart in your heart is the throne of God and He sat him on God's throne. But in the millennia, Amen. He set his own throne. No longer in your heart, his own throne separate. You will be there. He saw that he will raise up a man. His son, David's son, sat on his throne. I'm one man who just accept things the way they are, things the way they go. All &gt;&gt; don't try to fold your arms. No. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; A child of God, if he's in a position that he doesn't like, he will show God, you know better. You know it all. We are soldiering all. Let me just be honest with you. This the devil, Satan himself does not like this church. This church, &gt;&gt; the devil hate it. You know why? When we say the throne of God, we are referring to you. &gt;&gt; Now, how can he hate love you? He must hate you. He He want to see us, fighting, going this way and that way. But the mature child of God will say come what may. We will never leave the word of God. The day I die, God knows. The day I'm in the rapture, God knows. God knows everything about us. Now tell me, why are you worrying this morning? Why do you have a long face this morning? What's the problem with you? Come on. Let me just stop here. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Let's sing unto the Lord. [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] could not do. li [Music] I won't be leting. [Music] [Music] is all [Music] he [Music] might [Music] be great. [Music] Hallelujah.

This flesh is after its own Lord, Father God, the man inside us. David, when we read in Psalms 51, he says, "Don't look at me. Look at me through the blood." Father God, that is where our salvation is. &gt;&gt; Lord, Father God, Leno, it's you. and both we shall be one. Father we want to thank you. Bless the church Lord. Father God be gracious over this church through the blood. Look at us, Father God, because this flesh is cursed. What you are interested is is yourself through the blood. We want to pray once again.
