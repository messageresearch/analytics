[29:56] we have gathered here
[29:58] as your servants.
[30:01] We have gathered here [music]
[30:04] as your offsprings
[30:06] and we have gathered here Lord as the
[30:10] citizen of the city.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; We are here Lord Almighty
[30:16] through the thirst that is in our
[30:18] hearts.
[30:20] We always Lord Almighty pray for the
[30:24] meeting like this and pray Lord Almighty
[30:27] [music]
[30:28] for the gathering like this.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; As we are gathered here Lord Almighty we
[30:34] have no vile in our hearts.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; We have happiness in our hearts.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; We are aware Lord Almighty that you shed
[30:43] your blood.
[30:45] We are aware gracious heavenly father
[30:47] that there was power in your blood.

[31:06] to hear the living word Lord within us.
[31:11] We are gathered here as your children
[31:15] expecting Lord Almighty from thee. And
[31:18] always
[31:20] whenever we gathered
[31:22] there's always a dark cloud
[31:25] &gt;&gt; that will always come.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; There was a day when you call your
[31:30] children in heaven
[31:32] &gt;&gt; and the dark cloud came in
[31:34] &gt;&gt; and father you notice it
[31:37] &gt;&gt; and said where do you come from you dark
[31:39] cloud?
[31:41] And today also Lord Almighty,
[31:44] we are standing here
[31:46] &gt;&gt; as your children
[31:48] &gt;&gt; praying unto thee, recognizing Lord
[31:52] Almighty the power that you have given
[31:54] us. Recognizing fa father that when you
[31:58] open up the seventh sea you gave us
[32:02] knowledge and understanding Lord and
[32:05] father the power of the third pool which
[32:09] is the knowledge of who we are. That's
[32:12] why we stand here not being afraid of
[32:15] anything.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[32:17] &gt;&gt; We stand here as your children knowing
[32:21] Lord Almighty that your power is
[32:24] sufficient Lord Almighty.
[32:27] You went to Mount Calvary. You shed your
[32:30] blood.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; You engulf us Lord into your word.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; And here we are today. We have no doubt
[32:38] in our minds Lord. We have no doubt in
[32:41] our spirit. We have not doubt in our
[32:44] souls Lord. We are what we are because
[32:47] of you, Lord. And we are here to worship
[32:49] thee, Father. And we know that you are
[32:52] with us right now. And we are saying to
[32:56] the evil spirit,
[32:58] &gt;&gt; the dark cloud,
[33:00] &gt;&gt; that you are rather too late, devil.
[33:04] You are too late, devil.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; The seals have been open. [applause]

[33:36] us. And we believe with all our hearts
[33:39] that today you will stand behind the
[33:43] pullpit
[33:44] &gt;&gt; and you'll give us the living life.

[1:03:50] father. I have f I have fond memories of

[1:04:00] Lord has seen fit to call his servant
[1:04:03] home to eternal rest after he had
[1:04:07] accomplished his work on this earth for
[1:04:10] many years for the edification of his
[1:04:12] people.
[1:04:14] May the Almighty Lord God comfort you
[1:04:18] and strengthen you in faith and love and
[1:04:21] help you to keep the moral of faith and
[1:04:24] walk in the footstep he left in the sand
[1:04:28] of time. Finally, given my many
[1:04:32] responsibilities of my trip to Canada, I
[1:04:35] apologize for not being able to attend
[1:04:37] uh the pastor's funeral and I present to

[1:08:41] for you.
[1:08:43] [music]
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Holy
[1:08:54] [music]
[1:09:00] [music] Spirit.
[1:09:03] [singing]
[1:09:08] [music]
[1:09:14] [music]
[1:09:19] Amen.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Uh greetings to the saints in the name
[1:09:28] of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:09:34] Um it is quite a while
[1:09:39] since we have been this part of
[1:09:43] the ministry.
[1:09:48] Uh you know we have been taken care of
[1:09:54] by our beloved pastor
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; pastor is
[1:10:02] and we were enjoying ourselves.
[1:10:08] [applause]
[1:10:11] So as we stand here
[1:10:16] at the same time we also feel some
[1:10:18] vacuum
[1:10:21] and it's quite a big vacuum
[1:10:26] because the man of God has has served us
[1:10:28] for many years
[1:10:34] and he performed with distinction.
[1:10:43] So um we really appreciate the ministry
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; and we really also appreciate the family
[1:10:52] and we also appreciate you.
[1:10:59] So without any waste of time,
[1:11:04] I will ask that we open our Bibles.
[1:11:10] Uh we read from the book of Genesis
[1:11:12] chapter 1.
[1:11:15] We read from verse
[1:11:18] 1 to verse 5.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to 5.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 1 from verse 1 to 5.
[1:11:29] In the beginning, God created the heaven
[1:11:32] and the earth. And the earth was without
[1:11:34] form and void, and darkness was upon the
[1:11:38] face of the deep. And the spirit of God
[1:11:41] moved upon the face of the waters. And
[1:11:45] God said, "Let there be light." And
[1:11:48] there was light. And God saw the light
[1:11:51] that it was good. And God divided the
[1:11:53] light from the darkness. And God called
[1:11:56] the light day and the darkness he called
[1:11:59] night and the evening and the morning
[1:12:02] were the first day.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Can you pray for us brother?
[1:12:09] Gracious heavenly father,
[1:12:12] we want to thank you this morning. Thank
[1:12:15] you Lord for this beautiful day. You
[1:12:19] have gathered us, oh God, to this place
[1:12:23] because this is not a place that was
[1:12:27] created by us.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; This is your place, oh God.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; It's actually a place you chose to put
[1:12:36] your name upon.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; And now here is your children, oh God.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Coming from different places, oh God, to
[1:12:45] come to your place and hear you speak,
[1:12:47] oh God. You have never disappointed us.
[1:12:51] All the time you come, you descend on
[1:12:53] the pull pit, there's always something
[1:12:56] special that you say unto your children.
[1:12:59] Oh,
[1:13:07] like you always descended to your
[1:13:09] places, oh God. And then they would say,
[1:13:11] did our hearts not burn within us when
[1:13:13] he was talking unto us, oh God?
[1:13:27] Outside. sight.
[1:13:48] Amen. And amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[1:13:58] Now for our subject this morning,
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; I wanted us to talk about the children
[1:14:05] of the light
[1:14:11] because
[1:14:13] uh we come from that position.
[1:14:18] It's a position of light
[1:14:22] and um in that from that position
[1:14:27] you can be able to create
[1:14:32] like our father was able to create.
[1:14:37] And so the first thing that he said
[1:14:41] he said let there be light.
[1:14:45] Okay, let me read it again just uh so
[1:14:47] that we can be together.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; It says in the beginning God created the
[1:14:52] heaven and the earth
[1:14:55] period. Amen. And the earth was without
[1:14:58] form
[1:15:01] and void,
[1:15:04] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:15:06] deep.
[1:15:10] And the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:15:13] face of the waters.
[1:15:18] Now in verse three, that's where it
[1:15:20] becomes interesting.
[1:15:24] That's where he says, "And God said,
[1:15:27] Let there be light. And there was light.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; And we all know that
[1:15:35] that light
[1:15:37] it's is not the light of the sun.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; It's the supernatural light.
[1:15:46] M and if you continue,
[1:15:50] it says, "And God saw the light
[1:15:54] that it was good,
[1:15:56] and God divided the light from the
[1:15:58] darkness."
[1:16:05] The first thing that he said,
[1:16:08] "Let there be light." He never said
[1:16:10] anything about darkness.
[1:16:14] He just said,
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; "Let there be light."
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural thing.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; But remember where we have read.
[1:16:27] It says the earth was void and without
[1:16:29] form
[1:16:33] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:16:34] deep
[1:16:39] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:16:41] face of the waters.
[1:16:46] So if you look at it spiritually,
[1:16:51] God
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; had seeds
[1:16:56] lying dominant somewhere.
[1:17:02] So he was working towards those seats.
[1:17:07] Now to get to the seat,
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; you must first
[1:17:12] create an atmosphere
[1:17:15] that is supernatural
[1:17:18] because you are going to the
[1:17:19] supernatural people.
[1:17:23] Let me put it this way
[1:17:25] the perfect will of God.
[1:17:28] We are not supposed to come through sex.
[1:17:33] We were supposed to be called
[1:17:36] and we come from the dust of the earth.
[1:17:40] We were not supposed to be born.
[1:17:44] That is the perfect will.
[1:17:47] But he gave us the permissive one
[1:17:53] where we bypassed our theophonies.
[1:17:56] And we come through birth.
[1:17:59] And when you come through birth, it says
[1:18:01] you were born in sin
[1:18:04] shaped in iniquity.
[1:18:07] So you come short
[1:18:09] of the grace of God.
[1:18:12] So God knew that he's working towards
[1:18:16] something.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let me put it this way
[1:18:21] again.
[1:18:23] You see when we talk about the seals
[1:18:28] maybe let me read something in in in
[1:18:29] Genesis. I mean in in Revelation
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; uh Revelation chapter 6
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; 6
[1:18:42] it says
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; verse one more verse one
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; and I saw
[1:18:48] when the lamb open one of the seals
[1:18:55] and I heard
[1:18:58] as it were a noise of thunder
[1:19:03] One of the four is saying come and see.
[1:19:10] Now what I want to bring to you
[1:19:14] is that
[1:19:17] when the seals were opened,
[1:19:20] the first
[1:19:22] cannot be opened
[1:19:26] without the seventh
[1:19:29] because the seventh
[1:19:31] carries all the other sins.
[1:19:35] That is why there was the seventh man.
[1:19:39] the seventh star
[1:19:42] who had to come
[1:19:44] and interpret the whole thing.
[1:19:50] They were there
[1:19:52] but they were sealed.
[1:19:54] But there was a man who God chose so
[1:19:58] that he can open the whole thing.
[1:20:02] That is why when you read it, it says
[1:20:05] when he opened one of the seals,
[1:20:09] are we together now? I'm back to
[1:20:12] Genesis.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Let let there be light."
[1:20:17] It was a supernatural thing
[1:20:22] that needed to open the whole thing
[1:20:28] without the supernatural.
[1:20:32] You can't understand
[1:20:35] the word of God.
[1:20:38] You can't even
[1:20:41] when you try to imagine
[1:20:44] your mind
[1:20:47] is so limited
[1:20:49] to the capacity that God has.
[1:20:53] God is so big. God is so vast
[1:20:58] that to understand him
[1:21:01] you must first start there.
[1:21:04] Then when you start from that position
[1:21:08] the supernatural position
[1:21:10] of light
[1:21:13] then you'll be able to understand
[1:21:15] that you are a child of the light.
[1:21:23] Um,
[1:21:25] in other words,
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; we need to come to the realization
[1:21:34] that
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; we were sometimes darkness.
[1:21:41] The book of Ephesians says so.
[1:21:45] It says you were sometimes
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; darkness.
[1:21:54] That is why he started by light. Maybe
[1:21:56] let me just read it quickly.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Um Ephesians chapter 5.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 5.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read from verse
[1:22:10] um 8.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Verse eight. It says, "For you were
[1:22:14] sometimes darkness,
[1:22:18] but now you are light in the Lord. Walk
[1:22:23] as children of the light."
[1:22:29] That is why where we read in Genesis,
[1:22:33] it says it was void and without form
[1:22:38] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:22:40] deep.
[1:22:42] but the spirit of God was moving around
[1:22:47] because it knew that it's got an
[1:22:49] attraction power.
[1:22:53] That attraction power
[1:22:55] can transform death
[1:22:58] can transform sleep
[1:23:01] can transform death
[1:23:03] into life.
[1:23:05] That's what Ephesians says.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Just in being the carpet.
[1:23:12] I'll just skip to verse 14 in Ephesians.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; That is why it says,
[1:23:18] "Wherefore he said,
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; awake thou that sleepst
[1:23:26] and arise from the dead,
[1:23:31] and Christ shall give you light.
[1:23:35] See then that you walk circumspectly,
[1:23:38] not as fools.
[1:23:43] But as wise
[1:23:46] redeeming the time
[1:23:49] because the days are evil.
[1:23:53] Who can say you are living in days that
[1:23:55] are not evil?
[1:23:59] The days are surely evil.
[1:24:03] The days that we're living in
[1:24:06] does not require your power.
[1:24:09] The days that we're living in requires
[1:24:12] the supernatural light
[1:24:15] to operate within your life.
[1:24:18] That supernatural light
[1:24:24] is able to change your nature
[1:24:28] to that of Christ
[1:24:30] because he is that light.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He once came to Paul in a form of
[1:24:38] a light
[1:24:43] and Paul was persecuting the saints.
[1:24:49] But when he met that light,
[1:24:52] it was a blinding light.
[1:24:56] It strike him blind
[1:24:59] until he couldn't see where he was
[1:25:00] going.
[1:25:04] He recognized that this must be Christ
[1:25:13] and they gave him directions where he
[1:25:14] must go
[1:25:18] because God works in a man.
[1:25:23] That's the most dangerous place
[1:25:28] because man when he looks in another
[1:25:30] man.
[1:25:34] What can you tell me this one?
[1:25:37] But if God is in that man
[1:25:40] and is God speaking,
[1:25:43] you better be careful.
[1:25:49] I have taught there's one thing that I
[1:25:51] have learned in life
[1:25:55] actually I'm taught by the prophet
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; and the pastor
[1:26:00] they say if you can't respect a man
[1:26:06] respect the office
[1:26:13] if you can't respect the
[1:26:16] respect the office
[1:26:21] because that office is anointed.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; So
[1:26:31] we we are following
[1:26:34] and this light
[1:26:35] this light has got the resurrection
[1:26:37] power.
[1:26:40] It can even when you are dead not asleep
[1:26:44] but dead that light has got the power to
[1:26:49] give you life.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; That's what we are talking about.
[1:26:57] Now
[1:26:59] I want us to bring it a little bit
[1:27:02] closer
[1:27:04] because even nature
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; um
[1:27:10] types the spiritual
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; and you know um where we are reading in
[1:27:17] Genesis
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; um we're actually reading about how
[1:27:24] the heaven and the earth
[1:27:26] were created.
[1:27:31] Are we together?
[1:27:34] And I like the way it puts it.
[1:27:38] It says in the beginning
[1:27:41] um
[1:27:43] God
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; created
[1:27:47] the Now this is not the beginning of
[1:27:49] God.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; It's another beginning.
[1:27:55] It's the beginning of the creation.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; So that is why it says in the beginning
[1:28:03] because the beginning of creation
[1:28:08] and it says he created the heaven and
[1:28:10] the earth.
[1:28:13] Now it starts with the heavens first
[1:28:17] and then it comes with the earth.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; That is why I say I like it.
[1:28:24] And you know why I like it
[1:28:27] is because it affirms me
[1:28:31] that I did not start here.
[1:28:34] I started from heaven
[1:28:38] before I came here.
[1:28:40] This is just a battleground.
[1:28:44] We call it round number two.
[1:28:48] Round number one. We chucked him out.
[1:28:54] and we came here. We are after him.
[1:29:00] [applause]
[1:29:01] That is why he operates from under
[1:29:04] because we are still here.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; All right. Um
[1:29:13] I was saying
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; the natural
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; types the super
[1:29:22] Now, after God had done these things,
[1:29:27] h maybe let's not rush it a bit. Let's
[1:29:30] let's let's let's do this.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Let me take this spoken word.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Or maybe before I take that spoken word,
[1:29:40] let me do this. Amen. I will say
[1:29:43] um we we we just saw now here
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; the beginning of creation.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; So and then that beginning
[1:29:58] we are narrated the story.
[1:30:02] No no we are we are narrated
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; by Moses.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; So Moses
[1:30:12] uh was a blessed man
[1:30:15] because God spoke to him face to face
[1:30:20] and God could show him how the the thing
[1:30:24] started.
[1:30:28] Are we together?
[1:30:30] Uh so meaning
[1:30:32] God
[1:30:34] was able to transform
[1:30:38] Moses
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; and take him back to the beginning
[1:30:43] and take Moses actually back to his mind
[1:30:49] and we'll read how he did that.
[1:30:52] Let me read another scripture
[1:30:56] because we are talking about the
[1:30:57] beginning of creation.
[1:30:59] It's a civilization.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Let me read this. First John
[1:31:08] first John
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; 1 John chapter one
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; first John chapter one.
[1:31:20] Now I'm going to read
[1:31:24] as follows.
[1:31:26] It says that which was from the
[1:31:27] beginning
[1:31:30] which we have heard which we have seen
[1:31:32] with ourselves
[1:31:34] which we have looked upon
[1:31:37] and our hands have handled
[1:31:40] of the word of life.
[1:31:42] For the life was manifested
[1:31:46] and we have seen it and bear witness
[1:31:50] and show unto you that eternal life
[1:31:55] which was with the father
[1:31:58] and was manifested unto us.
[1:32:02] That which we have seen
[1:32:05] and we unto you
[1:32:09] that you also may have fellowship with
[1:32:11] us.
[1:32:14] And truly our fellowship is with the
[1:32:16] Father.
[1:32:20] and with his son Jesus Christ.
[1:32:24] Now the important thing here
[1:32:27] that I want to see
[1:32:29] is about that eternal life
[1:32:33] which was with the father.
[1:32:37] So it's another civilization.
[1:32:42] We read about the civilization
[1:32:45] of the beginning of creation.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Now we visit first John.
[1:32:52] It tells it tells us
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; that
[1:32:58] for the life was manifested
[1:33:01] and we have seen it and bear witness
[1:33:06] and show unto you that eternal life.
[1:33:12] If if you for you to see eternal life,
[1:33:16] how? Because you dwell in time.
[1:33:21] Are we together? So, um there's no other
[1:33:25] way
[1:33:27] that you can be able
[1:33:29] to attest
[1:33:31] of eternal life
[1:33:34] unless
[1:33:35] you came before the dispensation of
[1:33:38] time.
[1:33:40] Before
[1:33:42] there was time,
[1:33:44] you were there
[1:33:48] of the word of life
[1:33:51] which we have handled
[1:33:54] which we have seen.
[1:33:56] We are talking eternal things here.
[1:34:00] For you to see eternal things,
[1:34:03] you must have been in another body
[1:34:05] before.
[1:34:08] The body of the word.
[1:34:11] You must have been in your theophile.
[1:34:17] It's just that you bypassed it
[1:34:21] and you dropped into time. But before
[1:34:23] you dropped here,
[1:34:25] you were there.
[1:34:27] Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Then you are able to attest
[1:34:31] There was another dispensation
[1:34:35] before the starting of the creation of
[1:34:36] the earth.
[1:34:39] There was another dispensation.
[1:34:42] There was another civilization
[1:34:44] and I was there.
[1:34:48] Then I can attest of the eternal life
[1:34:52] which was with the father.
[1:34:57] Pastor taught us very well.
[1:35:01] Make no mistake.
[1:35:04] He has made us to be grounded
[1:35:10] to take our positions
[1:35:13] and take the foot forward.
[1:35:18] We are not fighting flesh and blood
[1:35:22] but spiritualities
[1:35:26] in higher places.
[1:35:28] Don't allow those spirits
[1:35:32] to dwell you.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; So now I just wanted to just to
[1:35:44] demonstrate you know that there is this
[1:35:47] side and this side
[1:35:50] and the pro the prophet speaks about it.
[1:35:54] Let me see if I'll find
[1:35:58] what I want to read here.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Uh the spoken word
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; uyalty of sin and the penalty.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; The cruelty of sin and the penalty.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; H I'm going to read
[1:36:13] paragraph 39
[1:36:17] paragraph 39. Um,
[1:36:20] so that Oh, yeah. We no longer have a
[1:36:24] watch there.
[1:36:26] Sorry. What time did I start? I just
[1:36:28] want
[1:36:30] Okay.
[1:36:32] Let let me use mine here. Yeah.
[1:36:38] Okay.
[1:36:40] Yeah. So let me take um
[1:36:44] this spoken word the cruelty of sin and
[1:36:47] the penalty that it cost
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; paragraph 39.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 39
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; it read as follows.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; It says now I want to draw just a small
[1:36:57] picture to you
[1:37:01] talking now.
[1:37:04] Let's all of us take a little trip.
[1:37:10] tonight
[1:37:12] on a little ship.
[1:37:15] It's a ship of Zion,
[1:37:20] a little spaceship
[1:37:25] or a ship.
[1:37:28] Let's go back a 100 million years before
[1:37:31] there was a world.
[1:37:38] Before there even was a star
[1:37:43] or anything
[1:37:46] and there you can see nothing but space.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; And all that space was God.
[1:38:00] That is why when people want to release
[1:38:02] something new,
[1:38:05] you know the marketers
[1:38:08] When they want to release something in
[1:38:09] you, they just say, "Watch the space."
[1:38:16] Watch the space.
[1:38:19] They keep you there. They know that
[1:38:21] they're creating anxiety.
[1:38:25] What is this space? What is after this
[1:38:28] space?
[1:38:29] Then you must keep watching this.
[1:38:32] Now the prophet says, you know, before
[1:38:35] there was even a star, Before there was
[1:38:37] a world, he want to take us.
[1:38:41] Let's travel with him.
[1:38:45] You know, uh because he was the seventh
[1:38:47] man.
[1:38:51] He knew things. He saw things.
[1:38:56] He visited dimensions
[1:38:59] and come and narate to us what happens.
[1:39:04] Now here
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; he's mainly
[1:39:09] showing us that
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; we come af
[1:39:24] you you need a a a spaceship
[1:39:29] spaceship.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; You know those rockets
[1:39:32] that they shoot
[1:39:35] And as they travel,
[1:39:38] they lift something
[1:39:40] is because the power of that thing is
[1:39:44] done.
[1:39:46] So they they drop the weight,
[1:39:49] engage the second power
[1:39:52] and continue. When that power is ended,
[1:39:56] drop it. Continue.
[1:40:01] you know. Um,
[1:40:05] okay, let me let me read maybe so that
[1:40:08] we
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; now it says
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; in paragraph 40 paragraph 40,
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; and now we'll watch coming into
[1:40:20] existence a little white light.
[1:40:30] We'll call it like a hallow.
[1:40:34] And that was the son of God,
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; the logos
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; that went out of God
[1:40:41] in the beginning
[1:40:44] and then
[1:40:47] that how he was standing there
[1:40:52] in his mind
[1:40:54] he begin to think.
[1:40:56] of what the [snorts] world would be
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; and drew all this picture in his mind
[1:41:07] and he said, "Let there be light."
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; And um
[1:41:17] remember
[1:41:22] we talked about the spiritual light.
[1:41:28] But now we are coming to a point
[1:41:32] where we want to see the natural side of
[1:41:35] it.
[1:41:38] Because the greatest light that you can
[1:41:41] find
[1:41:44] naturally speaking is the sun.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Naturally speaking,
[1:41:51] the greatest light you need
[1:41:54] is the sun.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; And if you look at nature,
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; you will see that it's attracted
[1:42:04] to the sun.
[1:42:07] Are we together? Look at life.
[1:42:12] Just a little light that can spark
[1:42:14] there.
[1:42:17] You see something springing up
[1:42:20] in the midst of a tarot.
[1:42:25] something just springs up because
[1:42:28] there's a crack there
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; and the sun is coming
[1:42:32] it attracts.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:42:36] um
[1:42:38] maybe just to show you a little bit
[1:42:41] I've just shared with harvest that solar
[1:42:44] system
[1:42:48] I just want to say something regarding
[1:42:50] that then I get back to this
[1:42:54] There we are. That is our solar.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And you can see there
[1:43:01] it's the sun.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; So everything
[1:43:07] the planets
[1:43:10] the stars
[1:43:12] they revolve
[1:43:14] around the sun.
[1:43:18] Now uh if you count from the sun
[1:43:22] you can see Mercury Mercury Venus
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; then comes us there
[1:43:29] and then mass
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; and so on.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; But if you look
[1:43:37] I can say to you or allow me to say
[1:43:42] do you allow me?
[1:43:49] Now allow me to say
[1:43:55] there's no foundation.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; It's hanging in space.
[1:44:02] Are we together?
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; But there is something that keeps it.
[1:44:07] Each one of each one of them
[1:44:10] is got a line,
[1:44:14] an axis.
[1:44:16] exist where it rotates
[1:44:19] and all of them they rotate around the
[1:44:22] sun.
[1:44:26] So apparently it takes 24 hours
[1:44:31] for the earth to rotate.
[1:44:34] That is why we've got day and night.
[1:44:38] It depends on what position
[1:44:41] of the sun to the earth.
[1:44:44] That's what brings day and
[1:44:49] This system
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; has never failed.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Not even one day.
[1:44:59] There was only one man that said, "Son,
[1:45:01] stop.
[1:45:04] He stopped the solar system."
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Because he was in battle
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; and he needed more time.
[1:45:16] Then he could stop time
[1:45:18] proving that
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; is from eternity
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; to eternity.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; So the foundation
[1:45:32] foundation
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; is that line.
[1:45:35] In other words, the foundation
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; foundation
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; is the sun.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; The sun has got the attraction power.
[1:45:43] is keeping all these planets
[1:45:47] attracted to it
[1:45:50] and therefore they keep their positions.
[1:45:53] We also have the S
[1:45:59] but we we rotate around.
[1:46:03] He makes us keep our position.
[1:46:06] I cannot fight for another position.
[1:46:11] I have mine.
[1:46:13] Amen.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; And I don't struggle.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; You know, if God gives you a position,
[1:46:25] you don't struggle.
[1:46:29] You know your position
[1:46:33] because you were placed there by the S.
[1:46:38] It's only the S
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; that can remove you.
[1:46:42] No one else.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; So that that that's that's the
[1:46:54] foundation
[1:46:58] that keeps us
[1:47:01] focused.
[1:47:06] Now I'm going to go again continue with
[1:47:08] my quotation.
[1:47:11] Um, I think I stopped in 41 if I'm
[1:47:14] right.
[1:47:15] 42.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to 42. Right.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; And it says
[1:47:22] because he had this thing in his
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; mind
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; mind
[1:47:26] the picture that we saw there
[1:47:29] was in his mind.
[1:47:32] He's so organized.
[1:47:36] When he does something, it's perfect. It
[1:47:40] does not need a mechanic.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Mechanic.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Okay. And an atom split and begin to
[1:47:48] break forward
[1:47:55] and atomic went off.
[1:48:01] the first atomic explosion
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; and them atoms begin to accumulate till
[1:48:09] it made into a cinderike.
[1:48:16] As the moisture
[1:48:23] ever what it was
[1:48:26] begin to break
[1:48:29] and the atom speed
[1:48:34] And after a while, there came a star
[1:48:39] or a piece of a missile that flew off
[1:48:44] and went through sailing through the
[1:48:46] air.
[1:48:49] He watched it maybe for a million years
[1:48:55] and then and then stopped it.
[1:48:58] Amen.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; He had no hurry.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; He had no hurry.
[1:49:07] Amen.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; He had plenty of time
[1:49:10] forever.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; He was from the beginning to the end.
[1:49:18] There was no time with him.
[1:49:22] And then another one flies off
[1:49:25] and it stopped over this way.
[1:49:28] Are we together?
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; All was in the mind of God.
[1:49:34] So you know this theory of the big bang
[1:49:39] is not far from the truth.
[1:49:42] Are we together? The prophet puts it
[1:49:45] like that as well
[1:49:48] that everything started to explode
[1:49:51] and he kept each one to its position
[1:49:55] until it became a perfect solar system.
[1:50:02] And when God
[1:50:04] wherever he is,
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; he looks at the earth, he sees a tiny
[1:50:10] dot.
[1:50:15] You can just go.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:24] Amen.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; But
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; remember that
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; he created this place
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; for us
[1:50:36] that we can continue
[1:50:38] to show the victory
[1:50:41] that we had with him
[1:50:43] back in heaven.
[1:50:46] If you were victorious there,
[1:50:49] then you're going to become a victim.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; nothing will
[1:50:57] touch you.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me go slightly faster.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; I want to go to
[1:51:06] maybe let me skip some of these things.
[1:51:08] Okay, no, I think I'm where I want to be
[1:51:10] now.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; What's he doing?
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; He is writing the first Bible,
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; The first Bible is in the
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; zodiac.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; The first Bible.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; It was written by who?
[1:51:37] The first Bible was ever written
[1:51:42] was written in the skies,
[1:51:45] the zodiac.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; It starts out with a vision.
[1:51:50] That's how he comes first
[1:51:52] and it ends up with Leo
[1:51:55] the lion.
[1:51:58] That's also how he comes again
[1:52:01] to bring judgment to this end.
[1:52:05] But
[1:52:08] God
[1:52:10] when he created or when he wrote his
[1:52:13] first Bible,
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; he knew that
[1:52:21] It will be so perfect.
[1:52:24] Only the pure in heart
[1:52:29] will be able to look
[1:52:32] and read the signs
[1:52:35] written in the sky
[1:52:37] and come back and interpret to us
[1:52:41] what is happening
[1:52:44] in our time.
[1:52:46] Amen. Amen.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:52:49] Um,
[1:52:53] let me put it this way again
[1:52:56] because we have the zodiac zodiac
[1:53:01] when when when there was time
[1:53:05] because remember man fell
[1:53:09] and after man fell
[1:53:11] it was in the interest of God
[1:53:16] to restore man
[1:53:18] back to his rightful position.
[1:53:22] Now to do that, God himself,
[1:53:27] he will have specific people.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; And I'll give you an example,
[1:53:34] the three men from the east.
[1:53:39] Those men,
[1:53:41] they were men that were able to look in
[1:53:44] the sky
[1:53:47] and that was their job.
[1:53:50] They took this thing so serious
[1:53:55] because their job was to study the
[1:53:57] stars.
[1:54:01] The prophet says they don't go in large
[1:54:04] groups.
[1:54:06] No, it's three three
[1:54:09] because three is the number of
[1:54:10] perfection.
[1:54:12] And then if many
[1:54:15] you'll hear the interpretation
[1:54:20] some interpretations
[1:54:23] will lead you astray.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; You must get the interpretation from
[1:54:30] God.
[1:54:34] not man-made
[1:54:38] man-made interpretations.
[1:54:42] They they cause confusion.
[1:54:48] Amen.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; But God's
[1:54:52] perfect.
[1:54:54] So the mages
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; because they were studying
[1:55:00] and then they saw this star
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; and they interpreted by
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; they said you see this one
[1:55:09] a king
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; is born
[1:55:13] and this star was not static.
[1:55:17] It was moving.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; It was a living inter it was a flying
[1:55:21] interpretation.
[1:55:25] They had to follow it.
[1:55:28] And as they followed it,
[1:55:32] you know, they came to a place
[1:55:36] where
[1:55:37] because they were going around and
[1:55:38] saying where is he?
[1:55:42] Where is he? And people were saying who
[1:55:46] born king
[1:55:49] and I think it was Herod.
[1:55:52] He said, "What are but there's a king
[1:55:56] bon
[1:55:59] and he thought he my kingdom is in
[1:56:01] danger."
[1:56:03] But he was a smart man.
[1:56:06] He said to them
[1:56:10] because he first called others to to to
[1:56:12] check where is this where is this going
[1:56:14] to happen according to the scriptures.
[1:56:20] And then they told him
[1:56:24] then and then he said okay then he
[1:56:27] called this man
[1:56:32] in Bethlehem.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; But when you find him
[1:56:36] just give me weight
[1:56:39] that I also may go
[1:56:43] and worship
[1:56:47] meaning that to kill him. Right.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Um but because God is God
[1:57:00] at that time the star had disappeared
[1:57:06] because it it knows the right time
[1:57:09] to appear and disappear
[1:57:13] to appear and disappear. So it appeared
[1:57:17] again
[1:57:19] after they got the message
[1:57:22] then they went to the place
[1:57:25] but the word came to them
[1:57:28] that men
[1:57:31] when you are done here you don't go the
[1:57:33] same way
[1:57:35] go the other route
[1:57:37] and also it went
[1:57:41] to the parents that were responsible
[1:57:45] to say run to Egypt
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; because the
[1:57:51] the the dragon
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; is after
[1:57:59] and then after they've done everything
[1:58:04] led by the Bible from heaven
[1:58:09] they went back home
[1:58:11] and you know after worshiping him and
[1:58:13] giving him the appropriate gift
[1:58:20] Now
[1:58:23] the perfection of God
[1:58:26] did not end only there
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; in the zodiac.
[1:58:31] No, there was a second Bible.
[1:58:36] Only the children of the light
[1:58:40] are able to follow
[1:58:42] the writing on the wall.
[1:58:46] Only the children of the life
[1:58:48] are able to read
[1:58:52] in their time what God is doing.
[1:58:56] It's very important
[1:58:58] to understand
[1:59:00] in your time what is God doing?
[1:59:08] So, so I won't read it now but where
[1:59:11] we're reading it tells you that now
[1:59:15] The second one
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; was the pyramid pyramid.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Now you must know if something is the
[1:59:23] word of God,
[1:59:27] it's mysterious
[1:59:30] and then everyone else
[1:59:33] would want to go and venture there.
[1:59:37] Yeah. That is why even
[1:59:41] there are magazines
[1:59:43] that you buy and then when you when you
[1:59:46] open the
[1:59:48] try and interpret the zodiac
[1:59:51] zodiac zodiac has got the stars
[1:59:56] according to the cluster
[1:59:58] as we read vision
[2:00:02] you name them
[2:00:04] but they if if if you are not
[2:00:08] predestinated.
[2:00:10] You'll buy that magazine
[2:00:12] and then they will interpret you
[2:00:15] say when were you born
[2:00:18] but you are a VGO
[2:00:20] but this month you're going to have a
[2:00:23] lot of money just look around.
[2:00:29] It's people trying to venture
[2:00:32] into something that God has created to
[2:00:37] talk to his beloved
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; and they twist it and make it something
[2:00:44] else. Now if you go to the pyramid
[2:00:47] also in the pyramid it was the second
[2:00:50] Bible.
[2:00:51] Now the second Bible
[2:00:55] it requires
[2:00:59] Did you see that picture of the solar
[2:01:01] system?
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; To build a pyramid,
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; you must master
[2:01:12] the measurements
[2:01:15] from the sun
[2:01:17] to the earth.
[2:01:21] That is why we have Enoch
[2:01:24] who was the seventh.
[2:01:28] Always the seventh man
[2:01:32] types the seventh star.
[2:01:35] We fall under the seventh star.
[2:01:41] So you must in other words to do that
[2:01:44] you must be a master
[2:01:47] of measurement.
[2:01:49] You can't use a tape to measure those
[2:01:50] things.
[2:01:54] Enoch
[2:01:56] builded the pyramid.
[2:01:58] He placed it in the center of the earth
[2:02:03] to such an extent that
[2:02:06] when the scientists came
[2:02:09] and looked at it,
[2:02:12] they even wondered
[2:02:14] what type of equipment did he use
[2:02:19] to put brick one big upon another
[2:02:23] because of their massive weight.
[2:02:26] And also they realize that it's right in
[2:02:29] the center of the earth
[2:02:32] because they say at any given time
[2:02:37] it does not cast a shadow.
[2:02:41] It's perfectly placed.
[2:02:43] It's aligned with the sun.
[2:02:46] It's getting it's getting 100% power
[2:02:49] from the sun.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; It has no shadows.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; 100%.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:02:56] You must be a master
[2:02:59] of measurements
[2:03:02] to build a pyramid.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; And the pastor was telling us
[2:03:08] that in the pyramid there are shafts.
[2:03:13] One is looking at blades.
[2:03:16] Are we together?
[2:03:19] Shafts that are positioned
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; to the zodiac.
[2:03:26] to show that there's an alignment.
[2:03:30] It's one Bible
[2:03:32] written by different people,
[2:03:35] one by God, one by man here, but it
[2:03:38] correlates.
[2:03:44] There's a correlation.
[2:03:49] The the the energy from the sun
[2:03:54] It's it's always full.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; And then
[2:04:02] um let me take the last thing here
[2:04:07] to say to you,
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; we
[2:04:13] come
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; at the time
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; where now
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; it started with the zodiac.
[2:04:24] He came to the pyramid and the dead it
[2:04:26] says it's the Bible.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; It's a it's in written form.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:38] This
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; and the pyramid
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; pyramid
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; and the zodiac
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; zodiac
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; they speak the same language.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Now when you come to this one
[2:04:53] Um
[2:04:56] um again
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; we all there there's many people that
[2:05:00] venture
[2:05:04] into this one. Are we together? They
[2:05:08] also call themselves
[2:05:10] the elect, the chosen, the bride. Are we
[2:05:15] together? But there is something
[2:05:20] that makes us
[2:05:22] to differ.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Because
[2:05:28] when you talk about this one, we can all
[2:05:32] read it.
[2:05:34] As long as we are able to read, we can
[2:05:36] all read it. Are we together?
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; But the difference
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; is the interpretation.
[2:05:46] Because it says
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; the letter killth.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; So this
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; actually kills
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; for you to live while reading this.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; You need another spirit.
[2:06:03] In that spirit this thing becomes a
[2:06:07] living.
[2:06:10] That is why the prophet
[2:06:12] and the pastor
[2:06:15] they talk about
[2:06:18] you know Junior Jackson's dream
[2:06:22] um
[2:06:25] it was the prophet speaks he puts it
[2:06:28] like this
[2:06:31] um let me see if I can find something
[2:06:34] here but if I don't find it I'll just
[2:06:35] quote Um,
[2:06:42] okay. No, it's um
[2:06:47] Okay, let me see.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I think it's this one.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Um,
[2:06:53] yeah, maybe let's go to paragraph 43.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 43.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Let me let me read here first and see.
[2:07:05] one. Amen.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Um, do you have for all three?
[2:07:11] Okay.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's the one.
[2:07:17] That's the one. Thank you, my brother.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm back in my thoughts.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Um,
[2:07:26] look to me
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; and then listen a little bit.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; We will read just now.
[2:07:34] So I I want to say to you that
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; h when we come to the interpretation
[2:07:43] it's something different
[2:07:47] because God
[2:07:50] has
[2:07:52] you know spoke openly
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; but only a few
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; that are able to grasp the mystery
[2:08:07] because I can read now it says you
[2:08:11] remember
[2:08:12] little bit messenger
[2:08:16] they went east
[2:08:18] the second messengers the dubs
[2:08:21] a little bit larger beach
[2:08:24] they went east and then I looked
[2:08:29] they was with me all the
[2:08:33] That was the first and the second pool.
[2:08:38] Now the third came
[2:08:40] from the west
[2:08:43] sweeping forward with great terrific
[2:08:44] speed.
[2:08:48] They picked me up
[2:08:51] that was coming back east
[2:08:55] with the mystery of these seven seas.
[2:08:59] Just like it said in Junior Jackson
[2:09:05] that the Lord let me interpret for him
[2:09:07] there
[2:09:10] on the inside of the pyramid.
[2:09:13] There was a white stone
[2:09:16] that was not written on.
[2:09:20] Yeah. Let me stop there.
[2:09:22] Now uh the prophet and the pastor they
[2:09:28] talk about the white stone.
[2:09:31] Now that white stone needed to be
[2:09:34] interpreted
[2:09:37] and there's only one man
[2:09:40] that had the interpretation
[2:09:43] of the white stone.
[2:09:45] Are you with me now? This man,
[2:09:50] he said he was caught in the pyramid of
[2:09:53] the angels.
[2:09:56] Now, I'm just trying to show you that it
[2:09:58] correlates
[2:10:01] from the zodiac
[2:10:03] to the pyramid.
[2:10:05] Again, in the pyramid, there is a white
[2:10:07] stone. Today, because this Bible is
[2:10:10] written,
[2:10:12] you need something within you
[2:10:16] which is a white stone.
[2:10:18] But inside you that white stone must
[2:10:22] have an interpretation.
[2:10:25] To get that interpretation
[2:10:28] you must listen to the tapes.
[2:10:32] the prophet and the pastor,
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; those
[2:10:38] will give you
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; the interpretation
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; because otherwise
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; if you look,
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; you look, you will not see anything.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; You need a man
[2:10:56] with a spirit.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; A man
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; with a spirit.
[2:11:02] to transfer
[2:11:05] impart life.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; And once life is imparted
[2:11:14] and then the Bible says arise
[2:11:17] the dead.
[2:11:21] You are no longer now with the dead.
[2:11:24] You have arrived
[2:11:26] where Christ is
[2:11:30] and you are being interpreted
[2:11:34] because to be honest,
[2:11:37] the white stone,
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; you are that white stone.
[2:11:43] You didn't understand yourself.
[2:11:46] Amen. You come to a place
[2:11:51] where they are interpreting the white
[2:11:52] stone.
[2:11:55] Then you step to understand yourself
[2:11:58] to say who am I?
[2:12:01] Oh Lord, who am I that I can hear these
[2:12:04] unspeakable words,
[2:12:08] the unwritten words?
[2:12:12] You know Paul says it was unlawful for
[2:12:14] men to act.
[2:12:19] But you
[2:12:21] they are right inside you.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; The correlation
[2:12:30] the system of God
[2:12:32] that he has placed
[2:12:35] to make man
[2:12:37] perfect.
[2:12:40] And then now
[2:12:43] I said to you,
[2:12:45] you know, you need to understand
[2:12:48] the time that you live in
[2:12:52] and the season
[2:12:55] because if you don't, you're going to
[2:12:58] have a problem.
[2:13:00] You know, there was one time I always
[2:13:01] tell the story
[2:13:06] I didn't understand when I was still a
[2:13:09] boy growing
[2:13:11] in primary
[2:13:14] the the days of the week.
[2:13:18] I was just guessing.
[2:13:20] You know that things
[2:13:23] you just guess.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Now, it so happened that
[2:13:30] because because it's a guess work.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; You're going to lose.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; So one day I was asleep.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Then h
[2:13:44] something says to me, "Hey, you are
[2:13:46] late, man."
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; And when I look at the window,
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; I can see that the sun is already now.
[2:13:55] And I thought,
[2:13:59] And then I I ran to to change quickly.
[2:14:06] I prepared myself my uniform,
[2:14:10] took my school back,
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; you know. I didn't even eat breakfast
[2:14:13] that day. I mean,
[2:14:18] you know, running
[2:14:22] corner.
[2:14:24] My friends are there.
[2:14:26] They're wearing shorts there.
[2:14:31] You know, home clothes. They say to me,
[2:14:36] "Why are you going?"
[2:14:40] I said, "Guys, are you not going to
[2:14:41] school?"
[2:14:43] No, today is Saturday.
[2:14:48] Just there
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; I I could see that guesswork it does not
[2:14:53] help.
[2:14:55] Guess
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; I need to learn this thing.
[2:14:58] I need to know Monday
[2:15:03] and I took it upon myself
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; so that I know the times and there
[2:15:11] so that I don't do something wrong at
[2:15:14] the wrong time.
[2:15:19] I must always be
[2:15:21] on time in season in due season.
[2:15:27] If you understand the times
[2:15:30] that you live in,
[2:15:32] then you start to relax.
[2:15:36] I didn't repeat that mistake again.
[2:15:39] It happened once. I learned a lesson
[2:15:43] and then from there on I knew the days
[2:15:46] of the world.
[2:15:49] Today is the first day
[2:15:53] [applause]
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; and and being the first day
[2:16:00] we honor
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; the resurrection.
[2:16:05] That is why we meet
[2:16:07] on the first day.
[2:16:09] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; You know, let me leave it here.
[2:16:15] I was just saying shalom.
[2:16:17] Shalom. Amen. [applause]
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; God bless you so much.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; There's a song that says, "I have a
[2:16:32] father."
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; You can lead us with that one.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:42] knows my name.
[2:16:48] He knows
[2:16:50] my every

[2:38:08] And this is the work that our pastor has
[2:38:12] done.
[2:38:15] We don't feel
[2:38:24] you have raised men and women
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; in this word. Oh God, they are able to
[2:38:30] stand behind the pullpit and they able

[2:38:51] talks about the order.
[2:38:54] He says, "Have you considered
[2:38:57] the order of the heavenly host.
[2:39:00] Not one of them is out of cater.
[2:39:05] They are holding their positions."
[2:39:08] And it is what we had this morning. May

[2:39:17] he's to come and speak, we pray that you

[2:39:23] session, a session of your word where
[2:39:27] your children have heard your word and
[2:39:31] they want to do right by it. Oh God, my
[2:39:35] God, I pray that I pray that you bless
[2:39:37] this service. Bless them as they come
[2:39:40] into the water.
[2:39:53] I love her. Amen.

[2:40:04] Acts chapter 2 from verse 36-39.
[2:40:09] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[2:40:11] know assuredly that God hath made that
[2:40:14] same Jesus whom he have crucified both
[2:40:17] Lord and Christ.
[2:40:20] Now when they heard this, they were
[2:40:21] pricricked in their heart and said unto
[2:40:24] Peter and to the rest of the apostles,
[2:40:27] "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[2:40:30] Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and
[2:40:33] be baptized every one of you in the name
[2:40:36] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[2:40:38] sins, and ye shall receive the gift of
[2:40:40] the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto
[2:40:43] you and to your children, and to all
[2:40:46] that are a far off, even as many as the
[2:40:49] Lord our God shall call.

[2:50:30] let the light shine on their lives that
[2:50:32] the devil will never be able to touch
[2:50:34] them again.
[2:50:36] Heavenly Father, heal them from their
[2:50:40] afflictions
[2:50:42] so that they can come back and worship
[2:50:44] you knowing that you are the creator
[2:50:48] and you made them to worship and honor
[2:50:51] you.
[2:50:53] They traveled so far, heavenly father,
[2:50:56] just to come to be baptized. [music]
[2:50:59] Heavenly Father, show them mercy. Show
[2:51:02] them grace.
[2:51:04] Heavenly Father, we know that you have
[2:51:06] already granted them the the desires of
[2:51:09] their hearts that Father, they may
[2:51:11] continue to be settled in your word and
[2:51:15] be able to grow.
[2:51:18] We know, Father, that the devil is not
[2:51:20] happy.
[2:51:22] So we pray as they walk out, heavenly
[2:51:25] father,
[2:51:26] that your light,
[2:51:29] your word, your angels encompass them.
[2:51:34] that whatever they touch, heavenly
