[52:19] play that
[52:22] testimony may the Lord richly bless you
[52:28] F
[52:31] Shalom so we have a brief testimony to
[52:34] share last week Tuesday I took Ona to C
[52:37] she was healthy she was fine no health
[52:39] issues at all around 3 in the afternoon
[52:41] I got a call from CR to say I should
[52:43] come fetch her because her temperature
[52:45] is quite high so I red to crash and
[52:47] fetched her and when we got home I gave
[52:49] her like a look warm bath so her
[52:51] temperature can lower a bit she seemed
[52:53] to be a bit fine although her
[52:54] temperature was not normal she went out
[52:56] deide to play and after a while she
[52:58] actually came back into the house and
[52:59] she looked like her enage was very
[53:01] depleted and then I picked her up I
[53:03] continued sponging her body like I
[53:05] continued giving her a look warm um
[53:07] Sponge over her body and then when I
[53:09] looked down on her she had stopped
[53:11] blinking so her eyes were literally just
[53:13] wide open and although she was not
[53:16] looking in my direction it looked like
[53:18] her eyes were fixated on something but I
[53:21] I could not see that thing so I stood up
[53:23] and started calling her name she was not
[53:25] responsive as I'm holding her um her
[53:28] breathing just started to be very
[53:30] shallow she was hardly breathing her
[53:32] color had started changing she was
[53:34] turning blue then I started praying as
[53:37] I'm praying I just remembered to um call
[53:40] the pastor so I called the pastor I
[53:42] called BR asked him to give the pastor
[53:45] the phone as he was trying to get the
[53:46] phone to the pastor I continued praying
[53:48] on my end until finally the pastor got
[53:50] to the phone and when he got to the
[53:52] phone I relate the situation to him and
[53:55] then he started calling on On's name
[53:57] from the get-go the first time he called
[53:59] her he was like on and it was like life
[54:02] rushed back into her body because she
[54:05] literally set up cuz she was in my hands
[54:07] all along she was not moving her color
[54:09] had changed she was literally not
[54:11] breathing she looked like she was gone
[54:14] basically and when the pastor called her
[54:17] called her um she was fine and then and
[54:21] the Pastor said move the the phone
[54:23] closer to her ear which is what I did
[54:26] and then he was like okay just give her
[54:28] water and talk to her she's okay and
[54:30] then my brother-in-law walked in cuz my
[54:32] husband was not around um my husband
[54:35] walked in um and he just took over gave
[54:38] her water I spoke to her and she was
[54:41] fine after that she took um a nap and
[54:44] when she woke up she was 100% fine she's
[54:46] not sick till this day she's fine so we
[54:49] want to thank the Lord for what he did
[54:51] for our family and um just the power
[54:54] that is in this ministry that we should
[54:56] always remember that God has given our
[54:58] pastor and authority and even though
[55:01] he's not here physically um his theophan
[55:04] is always active um so thank you God
[55:07] bless you amen
[55:10] amen I'm going to summarize
[55:14] it the sister was called at
[55:18] CR
[55:22] sister was called to say the child is
[55:24] not well
[55:29] the temperature was
[55:32] high so she took the child back
[55:36] home and tried to attempt to assist the
[55:40] child but later
[55:43] on the child was not
[55:48] well she seems to pass
[55:53] away not responding
[55:56] and the color of the child
[56:00] changed and the sister called the
[56:04] pastor Pastor
[56:08] Israel trust you know Pastor
[56:14] Israel so the pastor called the
[56:21] child through the
[56:23] phone the pastor asked the sister to put
[56:26] the phone close to the
[56:30] child and the pastor called the
[56:34] child the child came
[56:37] back hallelujah amen and the child was

[1:03:29] place
[1:03:31] father we surrender Lord Almighty
[1:03:34] ourselves unto
[1:03:36] thee we just read two
[1:03:40] verses and we believe father with all
[1:03:43] our hearts
[1:03:45] that you will always engage ourself
[1:03:48] yourself as you always visited us you
[1:03:52] visited our spiritual forefathers
[1:03:56] yes and you've been visiting us all this
[1:03:59] time you are the one Lord Almighty amen
[1:04:02] that knew
[1:04:03] us and you called
[1:04:06] us and you did everything Lord until we
[1:04:09] were
[1:04:11] Sanctified and
[1:04:13] tonight I mean this morning
[1:04:16] Father we are definitely sure
[1:04:19] that you will always be with us
[1:04:23] Lord we commit every everything unto
[1:04:27] thee knowing that father you have given
[1:04:31] us a
[1:04:32] promise of the revelation of the seventh
[1:04:35] seal yes sir and with that promise
[1:04:39] Heavenly
[1:04:40] Father we have the power which is the
[1:04:44] power of the third
[1:04:45] pool and we believe also in the changing
[1:04:48] of our bodies amen and we know also Lord
[1:04:52] Almighty who we are thank you Father yes
[1:04:55] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:57] Lord may you engage us once again thank
[1:05:00] you Lord amen and amen hallelujah
[1:05:04] amen okay you may be seated God bless
[1:05:11] you I have a title
[1:05:15] here the title will be the attribute
[1:05:20] sons of his
[1:05:22] Spirit the attributes
[1:05:31] yeah the attribute sons of his
[1:05:37] Spirit yeah but what I really want to uh
[1:05:42] uh uh speak about the Lord
[1:05:47] willing is that now there is a
[1:05:51] testing a testing
[1:05:56] before the promise
[1:06:00] Gates now before you enter into the
[1:06:04] promised
[1:06:08] land there will be a
[1:06:11] test like now uh the W is in the
[1:06:18] bride and that makes
[1:06:22] her a minor God
[1:06:27] now if you are a minor
[1:06:31] God then you will
[1:06:34] know that will reflect from what you
[1:06:41] are that will reflect uh from the
[1:06:45] promise
[1:06:50] itself in the
[1:06:53] promise there is a power
[1:06:57] and there is a
[1:07:02] potentiality because once God gives you
[1:07:04] a
[1:07:07] promise then you live by that
[1:07:12] promise but that does not mean that the
[1:07:17] devil will will will sit down and look
[1:07:20] and
[1:07:24] say it's done it's done and even God
[1:07:29] himself will test
[1:07:33] you to see if you uh you'll be
[1:07:40] able amen amen all right the the verse
[1:07:46] 15
[1:07:49] says
[1:07:51] Brethren I speak after the manner of men
[1:07:55] that is
[1:07:59] Paul when he says he he speaks uh after
[1:08:03] the manner of
[1:08:07] men he means that there's some things
[1:08:09] that is going to
[1:08:13] mention which are not
[1:08:17] usual or the unknown
[1:08:23] kind are we together
[1:08:26] so he says I
[1:08:29] speak after the manner of
[1:08:33] men which means th I
[1:08:37] speak and I will
[1:08:40] mention and unusual
[1:08:44] things things that you are not used
[1:08:49] to he continues and
[1:08:52] says though it be but a men's
[1:09:00] Covenant yet if it be
[1:09:05] confirmed no man
[1:09:10] dis that he says now what I'm going to
[1:09:14] say I would say it in the manner of
[1:09:18] men I will say it in an unusual way
[1:09:26] but once it is
[1:09:31] confirmed nobody should break
[1:09:36] it even if I
[1:09:39] speak things that are not usual to
[1:09:43] you in a manner of
[1:09:47] man but if those things have a
[1:09:53] confirmation you should not break
[1:09:57] them and you should not add upon those
[1:10:02] things don't break
[1:10:07] them upon them if they
[1:10:13] are amen then verse 16 it says
[1:10:17] amen now to Abraham and his seed were
[1:10:23] the promises made
[1:10:34] amen he said
[1:10:36] not and to seed as
[1:10:42] many okay we we we'll explain it what it
[1:10:46] says here now to Abraham and his
[1:10:51] seed Not
[1:10:54] seeds one one
[1:10:57] seed now to Abraham and his
[1:11:01] seed were the
[1:11:03] promises
[1:11:08] made to his seed
[1:11:12] only but he he he he reminds us to see
[1:11:16] that it's not seeds it's seed
[1:11:25] and thy seed which is
[1:11:29] Christ so in other
[1:11:32] words the
[1:11:34] promise is in the
[1:11:37] seed Not
[1:11:40] seeds Abraham had
[1:11:44] Sons had a
[1:11:46] son but there is a natural seat there's
[1:11:50] a spiritual seat
[1:11:56] now he says there's a
[1:12:00] seed which is
[1:12:05] Christ remember we are talking about the
[1:12:08] attribute of his
[1:12:17] Spirit God is a
[1:12:21] spirit and then being a
[1:12:23] spirit he had
[1:12:28] attributes and those
[1:12:30] attributes are called his
[1:12:35] sons so they attribute of his
[1:12:42] Spirit the sons of God when he
[1:12:47] says let us make man in our image after
[1:12:51] our likeness
[1:12:56] he was processing his
[1:13:04] son right amen that that that is his
[1:13:10] attribute he process what is in his
[1:13:16] mind don't
[1:13:18] forget that when we speak about the
[1:13:21] bride we are speaking about his
[1:13:24] attribute
[1:13:30] right amen and don't
[1:13:32] forget when you speak about the Seed of
[1:13:38] Abraham he's speaking about
[1:13:41] Christ and don't forget
[1:13:45] also when when the prophet
[1:13:48] says the word is in the
[1:13:52] [Music]
[1:13:53] bride the word is the Son of
[1:13:58] God there is a physical Son of God
[1:14:04] Jesus there is a supernatural sign Son
[1:14:07] of God which which is the
[1:14:13] word that's why the Bible
[1:14:16] says in the
[1:14:18] beginning so God has got no
[1:14:22] beginning there's no point where we say
[1:14:24] God begins
[1:14:28] here now that was the beginning of his
[1:14:31] [Music]
[1:14:34] process in the beginning was the
[1:14:40] word that is himself the word was with
[1:14:45] God the word is the Son of
[1:14:49] God that's why it says the word was with
[1:14:52] God
[1:14:56] it's not the second
[1:14:58] person no it's God
[1:15:01] himself he became the
[1:15:04] weight he became logos the pillar of
[1:15:08] fire when he became logos the the pillar
[1:15:11] of
[1:15:13] fire is not the second
[1:15:16] person is the same
[1:15:19] God who's processing
[1:15:23] himself don't forget that the
[1:15:27] bride is processed from
[1:15:30] God the bride is the word of
[1:15:35] God are we together so when he
[1:15:40] comes to fetch his
[1:15:44] bride he's going is com to fetch what he
[1:15:47] has
[1:15:51] processed are we
[1:15:53] together so when we talking about the
[1:15:57] quickening
[1:16:00] [Music]
[1:16:02] power it's when
[1:16:05] you have the
[1:16:08] revelation of who you
[1:16:10] are where do you come from when you see
[1:16:14] your
[1:16:16] position in an in in
[1:16:21] eternity then what will Quicken you
[1:16:25] is the is the very same
[1:16:28] word remember we are just a
[1:16:32] body but the
[1:16:35] word is what is what is the important
[1:16:39] part of your
[1:16:41] life the the the the
[1:16:45] quickening is when the word takes its
[1:16:49] position that will bring
[1:16:52] about the change in your body
[1:16:59] Jesus was in a Tom
[1:17:02] tomb and the angel
[1:17:05] came and open up the
[1:17:08] tomb there was no body
[1:17:10] there the body was
[1:17:14] quickened the body was changed doesn't
[1:17:17] mean that you get out of the
[1:17:20] body your body
[1:17:23] quickened it
[1:17:25] its
[1:17:28] form it goes back to what it was
[1:17:33] before are
[1:17:35] we right
[1:17:37] now now
[1:17:39] you are the
[1:17:43] attribute when the Bible says in the
[1:17:46] when the Bible
[1:17:48] says uh God is a
[1:17:52] spirit it counts you in
[1:17:56] God is a spirit it counts you
[1:18:00] in how would you
[1:18:03] get right
[1:18:05] now our story here
[1:18:08] is just before you
[1:18:13] enter right at the end of the
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:18] route you have to show your true color
[1:18:27] you are not going to walk
[1:18:29] [Music]
[1:18:31] in you f your way
[1:18:35] in you are a
[1:18:38] soldier I'll read what
[1:18:43] brother I used to
[1:18:46] say you need to know where you come
[1:18:49] from and know where you
[1:18:52] are and where you are going
[1:18:56] but today I'm saying brother Bram
[1:18:59] says keep going towards the
[1:19:04] end you keep going towards the
[1:19:11] end uh when
[1:19:15] Mary and Joseph went to
[1:19:19] Bethlehem you still
[1:19:21] remember to participate in the census
[1:19:27] that was ordered by
[1:19:32] Caesar Cesar Augustus Cesar a they had
[1:19:36] to go to
[1:19:40] Bethlehem to be
[1:19:44] counted
[1:19:46] uh the
[1:19:48] promise was to
[1:19:52] Mary the angel came to Mary
[1:19:57] and
[1:19:58] God came to
[1:20:02] Joseph so they had
[1:20:06] promised but now when now that promise
[1:20:09] need to be
[1:20:13] fulfilled Mary had labor
[1:20:17] pains to walk a
[1:20:21] distance you see
[1:20:25] God gave them a
[1:20:28] promise but
[1:20:31] towards the manifestation of the
[1:20:34] promise then there's a
[1:20:38] challenge see now right now we are
[1:20:42] waiting for the
[1:20:46] quickening and
[1:20:49] God needs to
[1:20:53] prove that you are are worthy for those
[1:21:00] people when things are pushing towards
[1:21:04] the
[1:21:07] end some
[1:21:09] loses the
[1:21:12] direction because they are not part of
[1:21:17] that right amen so now
[1:21:22] if the promise was not given to Joseph
[1:21:25] and
[1:21:28] Mary they wouldn't push
[1:21:31] on but they
[1:21:33] pushed even if there was no place there
[1:21:37] they pushed
[1:21:39] in it was
[1:21:42] fulfilled they are worthy for they
[1:21:45] worthy for
[1:21:49] that okay to back up my point let's
[1:21:52] let's go to uh the book of
[1:21:55] uh
[1:21:57] job you'll hear what job
[1:22:01] job job
[1:22:03] yes uh chapter 23 job
[1:22:07] 23 now towards the
[1:22:11] end that's why the prophet
[1:22:13] says keep going towards the
[1:22:18] end there'll be a lot of challenges but
[1:22:22] keep going on because the
[1:22:28] if there's somebody that can't go
[1:22:32] on that is not his
[1:22:35] promise but your
[1:22:37] promise is your promise you keep going
[1:22:41] on regardless of what is
[1:22:45] happening you move
[1:22:48] on because that's your
[1:22:53] life right job job chapter 23 job
[1:22:59] 23 let's let's read uh verse 10 to 14
[1:23:05] verse
[1:23:06] 10 14 look uh what God
[1:23:11] did to the
[1:23:13] devil he said what do you think about my
[1:23:17] seven
[1:23:21] job he's the holy man
[1:23:29] holy holy
[1:23:32] holy you won't shift him from the
[1:23:36] way now the
[1:23:38] promise was that now job will never
[1:23:42] shift from
[1:23:44] the regardless of what is
[1:23:51] going now listen what he says
[1:23:55] but he knoweth the way that I
[1:24:00] Take God knoweth the
[1:24:04] way that you
[1:24:07] take see amen you've taken the
[1:24:10] way because God knoweth the
[1:24:15] way and then he says when he had tried
[1:24:21] me I shall come forth as the
[1:24:26] go because he knowe it the way he's the
[1:24:30] one that called me I won't give up I
[1:24:35] won't be
[1:24:39] dismayed regardless of who says
[1:24:45] what I will
[1:24:49] continue I'm I'm talking about the bride
[1:24:52] now the bride will will never be
[1:24:57] dismayed
[1:24:59] because she is the word of
[1:25:03] God she is the attribute
[1:25:06] of you cannot change what you
[1:25:13] are if I
[1:25:17] am and then I try to make myself
[1:25:22] P it won't happen
[1:25:28] I will
[1:25:29] be
[1:25:35] is bright is the
[1:25:37] bright the word of God she can't change
[1:25:41] that's why that he knoweth the way that
[1:25:45] you'll
[1:25:49] take because he will
[1:25:51] try and you'll come forth as good
[1:25:58] uh verse 11 ver
[1:26:01] 11 my food had held his
[1:26:16] steps you heard what he
[1:26:18] say his way have I kept
[1:26:25] and not
[1:26:27] decline Nei have I gone back from the
[1:26:35] Commandment yeah never have I got back
[1:26:38] from the Commandment of his
[1:26:42] lips when he
[1:26:46] commands what comes out of his
[1:26:50] man he says when my word comes out in
[1:26:53] Isaiah
[1:26:56] 55:
[1:26:58] 11 when my word come out of my
[1:27:03] mouth it won't return
[1:27:08] vo when when he says
[1:27:11] bright the word
[1:27:13] bride comes out of his
[1:27:17] mouth it produces
[1:27:21] surprise there's no other way
[1:27:25] that's why he says my food had his
[1:27:29] steps held his
[1:27:33] step right amen so in in other words is
[1:27:36] him
[1:27:39] working my steps are his
[1:27:45] steps his way is my
[1:27:48] way when I say I've kept my
[1:27:52] way because his way
[1:27:54] are my
[1:27:57] ways there's no way that I
[1:28:03] can right amen so verse 13
[1:28:10] says but he is in one
[1:28:18] mind God is Not double-minded
[1:28:24] if God is Not
[1:28:27] double-minded his pride will never be
[1:28:33] double because that's his
[1:28:38] attribute what comes out of
[1:28:41] him it's one
[1:28:46] mind right amen he's of one mind and
[1:28:50] whom can I mean who can turn him
[1:28:56] you wouldn't change
[1:28:58] God neither would you change the
[1:29:02] bride it Remains the word of
[1:29:07] God how good
[1:29:10] amen and what his soul desire even he
[1:29:19] doth God do what his soul desire
[1:29:28] and when his soul
[1:29:30] desire it's you that desire
[1:29:36] that your
[1:29:40] desire it's God
[1:29:44] desire if God can't

[1:31:50] UTS and what he
[1:31:52] utter what you
[1:31:59] uh the prophet Give an example
[1:32:02] here about
[1:32:04] a a
[1:32:08] boy I think there was a
[1:32:12] competition that they will ride a bike
[1:32:14] on a
[1:32:18] plank it's a it's a
[1:32:21] competition so is this boy was was a
[1:32:28] cc his friend didn't take him that much
[1:32:32] sorry his friend didn't worry so much
[1:32:38] about right and they knew that you know
[1:32:41] he won't make
[1:32:44] it because they could
[1:32:48] see and then the competition went
[1:32:51] on they all went in one by one one by
[1:32:55] one they all
[1:32:59] failed then the the young man was the
[1:33:03] last he went
[1:33:06] through now they were
[1:33:09] surprised then they said to
[1:33:13] him how did you make it we we we know
[1:33:17] these
[1:33:19] things and then he
[1:33:22] said now fellows I tell you what to
[1:33:28] do or the boy
[1:33:31] said that he rode on to the end of the
[1:33:38] plank and the other boys got rounded and
[1:33:41] said how did you do
[1:33:44] it he said now fellows I'll tell you
[1:33:47] what to
[1:33:49] do when they started you off
[1:33:53] they give them a little
[1:33:55] push so that they could get
[1:33:58] started hold them up
[1:34:02] until they
[1:34:03] start and then they leave
[1:34:06] them you were looking down to this
[1:34:09] trying to keep your bicycle in
[1:34:16] board
[1:34:18] right uh but I never noticed down here
[1:34:25] you did that that made you
[1:34:29] nervous because you
[1:34:32] looking now right that make you
[1:34:37] nervous you think that you'll fall
[1:34:40] off I just put my eyes on the
[1:34:47] end and kept
[1:34:50] going to the end towards the end
[1:34:54] I didn't look around what's going on I
[1:34:56] just look the
[1:34:59] end we have a
[1:35:02] promise that's where our spiritual eye
[1:35:07] is we are looking at our
[1:35:09] PR we don't worry about what is
[1:35:13] going because we are the word of
[1:35:19] pro he said I look on
[1:35:24] and kept going towards the
[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:29] end so you looked
[1:35:32] around and you got no
[1:35:34] never I look towards the
[1:35:37] end that's how I have made
[1:35:44] it
[1:35:46] right now I said to you I'm reading a
[1:35:49] quote
[1:35:50] here possessing the enemy's gate
[1:35:55] it's paragraph n amen I will always say
[1:36:00] don't ever forget the
[1:36:04] title so that when what we're talking
[1:36:08] about should be in
[1:36:11] line it's the
[1:36:14] attribute of his Spirit and the text the
[1:36:19] text is is testing before promise
[1:36:29] promise
[1:36:32] gates are we
[1:36:34] together now in this uh book possessing
[1:36:39] the enem
[1:36:40] gates he
[1:36:43] says God had been testing the patriarch
[1:36:47] [Music]
[1:36:54] the
[1:36:55] Patriarchs Israel the
[1:36:59] ERS because he had given him a
[1:37:04] promise so the Patrick in this case is
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:11] Abraham God has been testing
[1:37:19] Abraham because he had given him a
[1:37:22] promise
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:28] then he continues and when God makes a
[1:37:32] promise he wants to be sure that this
[1:37:35] person is worthy for the
[1:37:41] promise before he fulfills what he
[1:37:45] said or what
[1:37:48] promises the promise is that they will
[1:37:51] be bright
[1:37:55] the bride of
[1:37:58] Christ now
[1:38:01] God want to see is this could be my
[1:38:08] bright it's a promise this is my
[1:38:12] bride now before the
[1:38:15] Rapture before the the
[1:38:18] going that is the Gage
[1:38:23] right
[1:38:24] amen right the promise
[1:38:29] gate God wanted to
[1:38:32] know that this pride is my
[1:38:39] pride that's what you
[1:38:42] say so Abraham had been promised that
[1:38:46] through his
[1:38:47] [Music]
[1:38:50] seed the whole world will be blessed
[1:38:55] that he will have a
[1:38:58] son the promise was to
[1:39:02] Abraham through you the whole
[1:39:06] world going to give birth to a
[1:39:10] son of which
[1:39:12] now he will bless your seed your seed
[1:39:15] that comes from
[1:39:18] do will bless the whole world
[1:39:24] right that he will have a
[1:39:27] son and his son out of him should come
[1:39:31] forth a
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:35] seed right amen and his son out of him
[1:39:40] that
[1:39:42] son should come forth a
[1:39:47] seed that will
[1:39:49] bless their whole world
[1:39:55] and
[1:39:56] Abraham when the promise was given to
[1:40:00] him he was 75 years
[1:40:04] old and Sarah his
[1:40:07] wife was 65
[1:40:09] years but the the Bible tells us that
[1:40:13] Abraham staggered
[1:40:18] not to the promise of
[1:40:21] God he never Stagg
[1:40:25] at the promise of God through
[1:40:28] unbelief but he was
[1:40:31] strong giving praise to
[1:40:36] God never
[1:40:38] stagered rig rigid and
[1:40:44] anchor because he is the carrier of the
[1:40:48] [Music]
[1:40:50] promise and his son should be the
[1:40:54] carrier
[1:40:55] of and on and on and
[1:41:00] on now in this case
[1:41:03] remember the Seed of
[1:41:06] Abraham is
[1:41:09] Christ that will bless the whole
[1:41:13] world and what comes out of of of
[1:41:17] Christ keep on being a
[1:41:21] blessing because the
[1:41:23] father is a
[1:41:27] blessing and the son will be a
[1:41:31] blessing if the word is the blessing and
[1:41:36] that word is in the bride then the
[1:41:40] bright will be
[1:41:41] blessing to the whole
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:48] world the pastor was
[1:41:51] saying you know
[1:41:53] what holds the
[1:41:59] wall that it should not
[1:42:02] continue is the
[1:42:04] seed which is the
[1:42:08] bride because the
[1:42:10] devil doesn't know what to do with
[1:42:15] you
[1:42:16] the somebody called
[1:42:20] me and asked me do you you know the
[1:42:24] demon you call that Demon's name I
[1:42:26] didn't write it down
[1:42:31] write said that
[1:42:33] one they don't want to use
[1:42:37] it because you people will kill the
[1:42:44] demon and that will weaken the
[1:42:48] devil so at the
[1:42:50] moment he uses
[1:42:53] he's just using am
[1:42:57] demons oh together but waiting for
[1:43:03] you then
[1:43:08] only release that
[1:43:10] Dem so there are so many tough and cruel
[1:43:15] and heartless
[1:43:21] demons that have been
[1:43:24] SP they can't execute what they want to
[1:43:29] execute because there is a
[1:43:32] bride and that bride is the we and that
[1:43:36] bride is Christ
[1:43:39] himself and that bride there's nothing
[1:43:42] that the devil can do
[1:43:45] with the only thing you should wait
[1:43:49] until we go
[1:43:55] right amen so he says the promise was
[1:43:59] given to
[1:44:02] him at the age of
[1:44:07] 75 he
[1:44:12] never so
[1:44:15] St not that the promise of
[1:44:18] God and he never sted through unbelief
[1:44:24] but he was
[1:44:26] strong giving praise to
[1:44:29] God and God Time After Time tested
[1:44:38] him but he had come to that final test
[1:44:41] before the blessing was going to
[1:44:47] happen before the blessing could
[1:44:51] happen that was the final
[1:44:58] because Adam lost the
[1:45:02] title now God want to
[1:45:06] give the title de to the
[1:45:09] bride he must make sure that he is a
[1:45:11] real
[1:45:16] bride right that is why we are the Seed
[1:45:20] of Abraham
[1:45:23] in
[1:45:26] faith right
[1:45:29] amen now he
[1:45:31] says the great hour of charge is at
[1:45:44] hand charges to
[1:45:47] attack the great
[1:45:50] hour of church
[1:45:54] is at
[1:45:59] hand the prophet says it's an hour now
[1:46:03] that you should
[1:46:06] attack you should
[1:46:11] attack is the great
[1:46:13] hour is

[1:47:39] Tabernacle this
[1:47:43] morning doubt on one

[1:50:36] to the battle is not a caral
[1:50:41] one the battle is
[1:50:44] of the
[1:50:46] Lord and if the word is in
[1:50:49] you that word will do the fight
[1:50:57] when
[1:50:59] Joshua cross
[1:51:02] over he met the captain of the
[1:51:08] host that shows that now from there
[1:51:12] on the battle was not
[1:51:17] Joshua's so he has crossed over to the
[1:51:19] pro
[1:51:22] amen now let's read
[1:51:25] it uh Joshua chapter 5 Joshua 5 let's
[1:51:30] read only two verses vers 14 and
[1:51:37] 15 so the attri the
[1:51:42] attributes which
[1:51:45] uh comes from
[1:51:49] God they are always in Array
[1:51:57] and the the battle we talking
[1:52:01] about it's not a physical
[1:52:05] B no it's a
[1:52:11] supernal now if you don't know the
[1:52:15] devil he can mess you up in 3
[1:52:21] minutes 3 minutes mess you up you can
[1:52:24] destroy the
[1:52:27] church are we together he tried that
[1:52:31] with our
[1:52:34] Lord but the word that was in
[1:52:38] him defeated him because he say it is
[1:52:44] written that was more than
[1:52:47] enough I said we should read Joshua
[1:52:51] chapter 5 Joshua 5 vers 14 vers 14 and
[1:52:54] 15 14 and 15 and he said nay but as
[1:53:00] captain of the host of the Lord am I now
[1:53:03] come and Joshua fell on his face to the
[1:53:06] Earth and did worship and said unto him
[1:53:09] what saith my Lord unto his servant amen
[1:53:13] and the cap of the Lord's host said unto
[1:53:16] Joshua lose thy shoes from off thy foot
[1:53:20] for the place where on thou sendeth is
[1:53:24] Holy and Joshua did so
[1:53:27] amen right you see now when he cross
[1:53:31] over he meet the captain of the
[1:53:37] host when brother Bram went
[1:53:41] Westward coming back he had a different
[1:53:48] Ministry a different Ministry
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:53] that was the ministry of an
[1:53:57] Angel and since
[1:53:59] then the ministry is of the
[1:54:04] [Music]
[1:54:06] Angels amen
[1:54:09] good let's read the the last one uh on
[1:54:12] that
[1:54:14] side Joshua chter 1 verse 5 Joshua 1
[1:54:17] verse5
[1:54:22] so the attributes of of of of
[1:54:29] God uh which which which are the sons of
[1:54:32] his
[1:54:37] Spirit they are really
[1:54:43] powerful if they know who they
[1:54:46] are with the right
[1:54:49] anointing you got it in verse 5 it's
[1:54:52] vers 6 5 josua 1 verse
[1:54:56] 5 there shall not any man be able to
[1:54:59] stand before thee all the days of thy
[1:55:02] life you see amen all the days of th
[1:55:07] life he
[1:55:09] said
[1:55:11] josua no man will stand before
[1:55:16] you all the days of thy life
[1:55:22] that is why brother Bram
[1:55:25] says God will
[1:55:29] raise
[1:55:31] Joshua to take you
[1:55:36] through so there's no
[1:55:38] enemy that can stand before
[1:55:43] them see that's what brother say he went
[1:55:47] to that and when they cross over it was
[1:55:51] Joshua that cross
[1:55:53] and when we cross over it will be Joshua
[1:55:58] that any church that does not believe
[1:56:02] that
[1:56:03] code it will be difficult for them to
[1:56:08] CR because they
[1:56:10] Joshua is's not
[1:56:13] sure he's not sure because now if you
[1:56:17] are Joshua you should know that you're
[1:56:20] Joshua and you let the
[1:56:23] flock cross
[1:56:26] over and you lead the flock to the
[1:56:31] back knowing that now the angel of the
[1:56:35] Lord is doing the
[1:56:39] [Applause]
[1:56:42] fighting we are
[1:56:46] together before they cross the River
[1:56:51] Jordan it
[1:56:54] overflowed right at the cage right at
[1:56:57] the
[1:57:01] cage at the promised gate they were
[1:57:04] promised the promised
[1:57:07] land when they had to
[1:57:10] cross the river
[1:57:16] overflow because during the
[1:57:19] Harvest that will always will happen
[1:57:24] so it
[1:57:26] overflowed Joshua was not
[1:57:30] dismayed the
[1:57:32] cap was there whether it's a
[1:57:36] river whether it's a
[1:57:39] sea
[1:57:41] whatever they crossed
[1:57:44] over
[1:57:46] look whether there is a big wall
[1:57:49] standing before you
[1:57:54] you will make
[1:57:56] [Applause]
[1:57:58] it because the word that is in
[1:58:00] you the one that will be
[1:58:07] Crossing are we together
[1:58:11] amen no one should be able to stand
[1:58:15] against
[1:58:17] you all the days of life
[1:58:23] not only for
[1:58:25] today be not

[2:01:36] sons of his
[2:01:40] Spirit see yes have not entered into the
[2:01:45] word from
[2:01:49] body this body
[2:01:52] which is a
[2:01:53] theop is subject to the
[2:01:58] word together the changing of the
[2:02:02] body is when the
[2:02:05] theop takes
[2:02:09] over at that
[2:02:12] time it was not
[2:02:14] revealed but will be unfolded towards
[2:02:17] the end time
[2:02:23] because the Bible say God is a
[2:02:25] spirit and they that worship Him must
[2:02:29] worship Him
[2:02:31] in
[2:02:33] truth and spirit amen and in Romans
[2:02:37] 8 in verse 16 it
[2:02:39] says the spirit
[2:02:43] itself right amen Beed witnessed with
[2:02:47] our
[2:02:49] spirit that we are the children of of
[2:02:53] God in other the spirit of
[2:02:57] God within capital
[2:03:00] S bettered
[2:03:02] witness with our
[2:03:04] spirit with a small
[2:03:09] s that we are the children of
[2:03:15] God and verse 17 says ver 17 and if if
[2:03:20] children
[2:03:23] if we are the children then we are the
[2:03:26] HS of
[2:03:30] God right we are the
[2:03:33] A and join as with
[2:03:38] Christ if so be that we suffer with
[2:03:45] him so that we may be glorified together
[2:03:52] amen that's why he
[2:03:55] said I and my father
[2:03:58] are so amen and when he Express then in
[2:04:03] in he says again what happen the same
[2:04:07] book then the attribute was
[2:04:12] first I mean the attribute was first
[2:04:17] God the
[2:04:20] thought right the Ed SC the
[2:04:25] thought that's the attribute
[2:04:29] itself all in
[2:04:34] one without being
[2:04:37] expressed so God
[2:04:41] was had something within
[2:04:44] himself that he wanted to
[2:04:48] express now what he expressed
[2:04:52] it's the
[2:04:53] attribute that is why we speaking about
[2:04:55] the attribute
[2:04:58] of uh sons of his
[2:05:01] Spirit the attribute sons of his
[2:05:05] spirit so that's how it is then when he
[2:05:09] expressed
[2:05:14] secondarily he became the
[2:05:16] we and then the we was made
[2:05:19] flesh and dwell among
[2:05:25] right if you go to John
[2:05:28] 10
[2:05:30] 10 uh in verse 37 verse 37 he says if I
[2:05:36] do not the work of my
[2:05:40] father believe me
[2:05:43] not 38 but if I
[2:05:47] do though you believe not me
[2:05:52] believe the
[2:05:54] works that you may
[2:05:56] know and believe that the father is in
[2:06:00] me and I'm in
[2:06:04] him you can't teach a
[2:06:07] person to walk upon the
[2:06:12] sea no you can't you can teach him to
[2:06:18] swim but you can't teach him to walk up
[2:06:26] now the
[2:06:28] bright is the revealed
[2:06:32] weight a
[2:06:33] preacher cannot reveal the
[2:06:37] weight the preacher preaches the
[2:06:41] way and you see it there and you grasp
[2:06:45] it there the preacher of got an
[2:06:48] anointing and while you sitting down
[2:06:51] here
[2:06:52] we are all
[2:06:54] preachers we preach
[2:06:58] together we are in in one
[2:07:03] Harmony and if you are not in that
[2:07:06] Harmony you will
[2:07:08] doze because it's not part of your
[2:07:13] life when the preacher prepares a
[2:07:17] message he prays until he gets an
[2:07:20] anointing
[2:07:22] until you get
[2:07:24] inspired until you get F and when you
[2:07:28] come to
[2:07:30] the you pray until you get an
[2:07:35] anointing until you get an inspiration
[2:07:39] you take it by
[2:07:42] faith that makes you a
[2:07:45] son that make one
[2:07:50] Harmony now together so as you are right
[2:07:54] now you are preaching together with
[2:08:00] me are we
[2:08:04] together so now if you
[2:08:08] not listen what he says verse 38 but if
[2:08:12] I
[2:08:13] do though you believe not
[2:08:18] me believe the works
[2:08:22] that you may
[2:08:24] know and
[2:08:26] believe that the father is in
[2:08:29] me and I in
[2:08:33] him now if you you you go back to I'm
[2:08:37] about to close if you go to the spoken
[2:08:39] word is the Original
[2:08:41] Seed in paragraph
[2:08:43] 806 806 he speaks
[2:08:48] about uh that we should live in a way
[2:08:52] that reflects the
[2:08:58] peace and
[2:09:02] wellness that God wants for
[2:09:06] us that that is what we call
[2:09:10] Harmony Harmony is when you are living
[2:09:13] in a way that reflects
[2:09:19] peace if you don't
[2:09:22] peace we are not in
[2:09:27] harmony if you reflect
[2:09:31] peace and
[2:09:33] wellness that's what God wants from you
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:09:37] you and
[2:09:40] wellness that is harmony listen to what
[2:09:43] he says in paragraph
[2:09:45] 806
[2:09:47] notice what Harmony
[2:09:51] Jesus never did anything until sin of
[2:09:55] the
[2:09:59] father now that confuses a lot of
[2:10:08] people that until he sees the Father the
[2:10:11] things that he copy from the father oh
[2:10:14] the father is doing that I'm doing
[2:10:19] this the word is the father in
[2:10:24] you that's why Philip said show us the
[2:10:29] father he said the father is in me and I
[2:10:32] am in
[2:10:34] him and so all this time we not aware
[2:10:38] that it's not me doing that it's the
[2:10:41] father that is
[2:10:43] doing now that same father is in you now
[2:10:48] those same words that Jesus spoke you
[2:10:52] should be speaking
[2:10:55] them because it says at that day you
[2:10:57] shall
[2:10:59] know if you shall know then those wordss
[2:11:03] will be your
[2:11:05] wordss and he is he he moves on and says
[2:11:10] now the harmony between God and
[2:11:17] Christ and that's where now he says now
[2:11:21] he say so will the
[2:11:25] bride and he shows her his way of
[2:11:30] life he shows her and she receives
[2:11:35] it and she never
[2:11:38] doubts nothing can harm
[2:11:43] her not even that for if the seed be
[2:11:50] planted the water will raise it
[2:11:53] up that's why now he says here is the
[2:11:58] secret the word in the
[2:12:04] bride that when we read what
[2:12:08] amen
[2:12:10] now this is this book I'm
[2:12:13] closing this book uh
[2:12:17] experiences an old book The Prophet
[2:12:20] preached that book
[2:12:23] 1948 some of you were not born
[2:12:26] by I was also one year old when he was
[2:12:30] preaching about this but this code is
[2:12:32] still working for
[2:12:36] us he says your faith is the only thing
[2:12:40] that can do you any
[2:12:46] good that's your belief your faith in
[2:12:50] God
[2:12:52] without faith it's
[2:12:57] impossible now you believe it with all
[2:13:00] your
[2:13:02] heart know you should believe who you
[2:13:08] are you are the briide believe that you
[2:13:11] are the
[2:13:15] pride you see amen there were no signs
[2:13:18] in Abraham
[2:13:21] or or in Sarah but he
[2:13:25] believe when Moses faed the Red
[2:13:29] Sea there's no way in which he can cross
[2:13:32] it he
[2:13:35] believed when
[2:13:37] Joshua fa the River Jordan it
[2:13:40] overflowed but the promise pushed
[2:13:44] go
[2:13:46] through now you could see Darkness
[2:13:51] you could see Darkness but keep on
[2:13:57] pushing look at the promise the promise
[2:14:00] will push
[2:14:02] you you stick to the
[2:14:04] promise and then it will let move
[2:14:07] on you look Beyond you go right
[2:14:11] there your faith is the only thing that
[2:14:15] can you any
[2:14:21] now he
[2:14:22] says well now look sight is a sense
[2:14:29] sight of the body is that
[2:14:33] true sight is one of the
[2:14:37] senses how many senses are there in the
[2:14:42] body
[2:14:43] see taste feel smell and hear and how
[2:14:51] many senses are there to
[2:14:54] [Music]
[2:14:57] Spirit in your spirit how many senses do
[2:15:00] you
[2:15:00] have he says
[2:15:03] two faith and
[2:15:06] doubt your spirit is either Faith or
[2:15:13] doubt that is the sense of your
[2:15:17] spirit so faith is the sense of your
[2:15:19] spirit
[2:15:23] let me close by this
[2:15:25] code this
[2:15:27] comment came from the pastor one
[2:15:31] day I wrote it down I liked
[2:15:35] it what he says he said I'm quoting the
[2:15:39] pastor
