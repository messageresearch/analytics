Um as you know even my pastor know is here I'm very short. You see? Yeah. Amen. Short. Amen. I'm here to officiate that not to preach. But while standing on our feet, my brother here will read for me. Matthew chapter 19 verse 3 to 8. Verse three. And then we are going to read again proverbs 19 verse14 19 verse 14 14 Matthews chapter 19 from verse 3 to8 the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for recourse. And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man live father and mother, and shall live to his wife, and they twin shall be one flesh. Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put a sand. They say unto him, why did Moses then command to give a writing of divor divorcement and to put her away? He said unto them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. Amen. Uh let us pray. My dear heavenly father, this is another chance once more. A privilege. Yes sir. You have privileged me with to stand in front of these two here. Amen. With their parents. Yes sir. I would like you to come and just give us something. Hallelujah. Before we can join them together. I'm asking from you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You may take your [Music] seats. Pastor, I'm going to talk about something like this. The original marriage, the real marriage is the invisible becoming visible. This is what I'm going to talk about. The real marriage is when the visible become visible. Amen. When the Pharisees came to Jesus, talking about the visible marriage. Jesus answered them about the visible visible. He said, he who made them in the beginning. He said their union their their union is not when you see them be married. Their union is from the beginning. He said he made them in the beginning. He made them male and female. That is what Jesus told them. But we had to go back because he said, but in the beginning it wasn't so then we must go to the beginning and see how it was. And when we go to the beginning, we find the same statement he said before in verse four. Verse four, because the Bible in Genesis 1 verse 26-28 26 28 said God said, "Let us make men in our own image." That's right. And the Bible said he made he him. in his own image and in his own likeness. He made him male and female and blessed them. But we we have to follow the way he blessed them. Then we we go to Genesis chapter 5. Read it my brother. We followed the way he blessed us. Read Genesis 5:2. Let's hear it. Genesis 5:2. Male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created. Amen. After he had created them male and female in his likeness, He blessed them. Then he said, "You are Adam." The Bible says he called them Adam. When after he had created them, that is the first union. A man in the likeness of God. Then we go to Genesis chapter 2 then I think is verse um verse 21 and 25 21 because Genesis 1 26 and 286 28 it was the invisible marriage. It was the the invisible union just like our prophet has preached the message the invisible union of the bride and bride. That is what has happened to us. We we had a invisible union with Christ. But in the merry supper there it will be a visible union. Are you together now? Amen. The prophet preached that it has already happened the invisible union between the bride and the bright. But we are waiting for the visible one. In Genesis chapter 1, it was an invisible you know. And in Genesis 2 25- 26 25 26 21-2 it was the visible union. Those who were together before they were brought again to be together. And that is that is the real marriage. The real marriage is the in is the invisible becoming [Applause] visible. But the the the m which is not real is when the invisible is not becoming visible. Because we have got the two seeds here. The seeds from Satan's which was swn by Satan the seed which was which was sown by God. If the the one from the seed of Satan, if someone from the seed of Satan wanted to marry one from the seed of God, that one, it is not the invisible union become invisible. That one will have to stop or it will have to be a tolerated marriage. Because that is what you call magbas. This does not belong here. But you try to preach. When you try to put it there, sometimes it will just hold for a while when you still driving the wheel will get out [Applause] because it is mas. Amen. after he had created them in his own image. Amen. If a man is alone is not the complete image of God. Amen. If a woman is alone is not a complete image of God. The complete image of God is male and female. Amen. The correct marriage here is a good type because God was foreseeing something coming. The bride and the bridegroom when he was making this marriage. He was foreseeing something there. And if you see this one, if you see this one, you already see something coming there. The real marriage here, the real marriage because Jesus said, Paul said, "A woman must be submissive under his husband just like Christ and his church." In other words, the real marriage in his church, the marriage Jesus is talking about here, it it wasn't so in the beginning because he who made them in the beginning, he made the male and female after he had created them. Then in Genesis chapter 2, We see God saying taking the soil making a formation then taking that create created and put it into a formation. Are you together? He took that creation and put it into the formation. When the creation in is in the formation and God said it is not good. Even man is alone because it it was not like this in the for the Bible says it seems Adam was alone because part of him was still a theophant. So God said now I must bring these two to be visible. Amen. He cause a man to a deep sleep out of his body God created for that man a wife. But you must, this one is a secret. You mustn't talk it loudly. God took the the plan of this woman from Satan. Okay. When he created this female, the plan plan was from Satan. Hey, it's a secret because he was the only beautiful creature among all the creation. All right, let's leave it there, pastor. Let's just put it down there. But let's go on with what we have. He took from the reap and created for this man a woman. Amen. The Bible says here, riches and everything, you can get them from your parents. But a prudent woman, you will get it from God. Amen. That's why the Bible says before you marry you must approach marries prayerfully. Why does it say prayerfully? Because a prudent woman you can get it from God only. So you must ask so that you can be given because he said ask it shall be given. Amen. But because they are rushing, they cannot wait to to be given. They rush and when they rush it make Satan happy. That is that is what Satan want for the young men to rush so that he can use their eyes. So that Satan can use their eyes to choose so that they can choose according to him. Right? After he had made a wife from this one, he then took the feminine spirit from Adam and put it into this. That's why he said, "Let me go on reading." He said in verse five, verse five, "For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall live to his wife, and they twin shall be one flesh." Amen. Why? Why should why should he leave his mother and father? Because he was born there but it was not his original and this woman was born there because of birth. They were born from different parents. But original they came from one source. When they recognize that we are original, we are together. They leave their parents. They came together because now they have recognized that we were together. Oh, because a a sister and a brother originally if they are children of God to together they together they came from the mind of God together. Amen. Then they were born here from different parents but together they came from one place. Amen. I and my brother we came from the same place. Amen. That's why we have seen the message. We we have had people well long ago But not long because I'm not I'm not I'm not old. Who is oldest? And then um we used to sing a song when we were outside of the message. [Music] Oh God, we don't know how God can make us one. But God brought a something to make us one which is the message because you come from your place there and you come you've come from a a Pentecost church assemblies assemblies of God in South Africa assemblies of God South Africa and you come from Lutheran church in America and Methodist church. You come from different places and God has brought the oneness here and the oneness is the message. When you come to the message, you become one. That is what makes you one. Then a a young man is born at family. and a sister family. Then they go brought them to the message because it it was their place and they find each other in the message. Amen. Because it is their place where they come from. Amen. But I mean those who have received the message. He who hears my word and believeth on whom he sent me has everlasting life. But the prophet says a drunkard can hear it and a pro can hear it and say I believe you. But when we say he who he has, we mean he who it is revealed to him. That is you see. Hi. Are you listening [Applause] people? The word of God is a seat. Amen. Some people just read here and stop here. You must move with the word. If you can stop here, you will bring people to a wrong station. So when he said he who then we go further, he says he that have an ear. Let him hear. You hear because you've got the is not everyone who hears who accept. Amen. Some will say I have heard but they have had nothing. They will tell you the prophet says but they have got nothing. They stop at some certain quotes. They stop there. They said the prophet said this but they don't know what what he had said there. Amen. The Bible doesn't say go the Holy Ghost take the message and give it to a sheep. The Holy Ghost brings the message directly to the shepherd because it is the Holy Ghost which has made that shepherd can't it can't make a shepherd and leave the shepherd there and give the message to a sheep the Holy You must not forget we have got fake pastors here. Fake those. The Holy Ghost will never take the message to them. You better take it to a ship. [Music] Amen. He says here for this cause shall a man live father mother it they is where they were born. Amen. Because this flesh is brought here by sin. We were born in sin, shaped in iniquity, coming to the world, speaking life. A person who is not born again, his nature is to speak life. When he speaks lie, no conscience, he will tell you a lie. When you say, "But my brother, you said like this." He said, "No, me." Amen. Because of that no one is born a without sin we we were born with sin all of us but God brought something which will take us from that position because from the beginning before the Beginning he had a thought that he wanted to be a savior. That is why we were born sinners so that he can come and save us. Amen. He have not come to save sinners. Sinners will never be saved. They are born sinners. Hell is created for Satan and his angels. Those who are defeated there in heaven who Satan has deceived in they are here in flesh. Those who have defeated Satan there are also here in now we are fighting here. Our fight doesn't start here. Amen. And it will never end. It will end at the Armageddon. I was in Christ. You were in Christ. Let me read here. He never came to save the devil's children. They never will know it. Because we are born in sin. Let me read. Go on. And they are so sh in their ways of their intellectual learning that you can't compare with them at all. They can put scriptures in a way as you can say this brother. He said you cannot compare with them compare but they don't have a revelation. That one they will never have. Even if they can go to the mountain and fast, they will come without the [Applause] [Music] rest. You can't compare with them at all. You can't out talk them, but by faith you see it. [Music] Amen. He knew you are going to born at that family system. He knew that. He said but I will come and save that sister. He knew brother that. And he said I will come and save that brother so that he can meet that sister. They will they will meet each other. in the message. Amen. That's why he said under no circumstances should a believer marry an unbeliever because they don't come from the same. Amen. Amen. But the problem is in here we have those those who seem to be Christians but they are not Christian then they come to me as a pastor Mar as pastor I married them but I don't know where they come But they've said they believe the message and I believe that their lives will prove. [Applause] Amen. For this cause, man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife. Because if they come from one source, when they come together, they cleave. That's why he says here what God has put together no one should put a son if he had created them male and female who will separate no one. But if if they were not united there they will never be united. Amen. They don't have the same blood because if if they were united there blood of Jesus Christ was shed for them connect them together again. He said that wherefore what therefore God had joined together let no man put us under when Adam and Eve when Adam was woken up by God when he look No one said there who is this man who this man when he woke up he said this is the bone of my bone the flesh of my flesh that is a young man when he see the sister for the first time he said this one will be my wife without reason the prophet says that one will be your wife. But if you say, "I will marry this one because he's more beautiful than me." You see, if if this one does not agree, then I will I will try Salamita. [Applause] This is not the original marriage.
