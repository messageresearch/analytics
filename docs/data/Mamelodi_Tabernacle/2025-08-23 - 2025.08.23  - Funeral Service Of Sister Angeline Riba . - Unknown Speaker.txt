Let's read from the book of John chapter 8 only verse 23. Verse 23. Amen. Amen. And he said unto them, you are from beneath. I'm from above. You are of this world. I'm not of this world. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this morning at the funeral of our mother, we want to comfort the family, everyone that was close to her. Just same few words from the Bible. We are still on time. We must leave the area at 9:00. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to share with you this morning title. You you will worship God from your origin. I want to be honest with you this morning. day you were baptized not the day you started worshiping God you worship God from where you come from you have the origin and from there on you started worshiping him in this flesh is the continuity when the flesh dies eyes. You don't stop, you continue worshiping. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why when Jesus Christ meet these people that read the Bible, the scribes, [Music] you know, the Pharisees and the tax collectors, he he tell them straight. You are from beneath and from above. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was telling them of their origin. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; A child of God to begin with is a child of God. Even now is a child of God. Even after death, a child of God. But a sinner sinner to begin with today will be a sinner after death. [Music] For the Bible says, there was a war in heaven. When there was a war in heaven according to Revelation 12, every one of us, every one of us here, you took a stand. And when you fight, you fight from that position. You you you fight from the stand you take. If you were on the wrong side, you cannot be in the right side of God today. Life is continuing. Amen. Amen. God allowed us in this world to show ourselves to who we are. I want to give you few example. from you know the life in the Old Testament &gt;&gt; is not the same &gt;&gt; as the life in the New Testament and the life in the New Testament is not the same as our life today. The Bible consist of Old Testament, New Testament, and it's a complete book. We call it a Bible. We are living at the backside of the Bible. We are another generation. Amen. Amen. In the Old Testament, the devil has access to everything. He can bewitch you. He can raise you from the dead. He can report you to God. He can do anything he want. That was the life of the Old Testament. In the New Testament, something different in our time. Something different. Let's look this thing through the Bible. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to read the scriptures, but I'll just quote when you are at home, &gt;&gt; you can read them. There was a time more Job 2 verse1 where the children of God were coming to God. And the Bible says even Satan had an opportunity to report and he was reporting the children of God. And the report of the devil is always negative. He was a negative man to begin with. There's nothing good. He can tell God about you. But the only thing that we can speak to God about God, you overprotected that man. God, I heard him lying yesterday. God, I heard him thinking of negative things yesterday. Work of the devil. When the children of God come before God appreciating him, Tell him how much they love you but not the devil. Be careful if you are always saying negative things. If you are not at the footstep of the devil and there are those people in life when they talk, you just get bored because you know there's nothing good they going to talk about. They are negative. were negative to begin with. They are that was the work of the devil. You protected Job Isaiah is a sinner. That man is a sinner and God was just listening because God is a good God. He knows that is his time and I will leave it like that. But it's not a perfect time. I changed things. Amen. Amen. Amen. So God allowed Amen. Chapter 28 Chapter 28- 17 &gt;&gt; verse 7-1 17 &gt;&gt; it speaks about a woman of a devilship get access as well. Amen. To do whatever she can do. Amen. And one of the days Saul asked her to raise someone from the dead and she did. And you will be surprised how can a sang raise a prophet of God from the dead. God was just looking and say is there time? I will just leave it like that. But that time one of the days it will come to an end. God knew about it and he let it go and they thought they were on top of their game. But the time come and the time will pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. God was just looking at that. You know if uh we we have we have shortteered and if God has shortteer like us This world could have end long time ago but God is patience. That's why patience is one of the virtue. If you have patience, you have it go. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God knew and let it go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you read first kings chapter 22 &gt;&gt; verse 19-23 &gt;&gt; verse 19-23 &gt;&gt; the Bible says there was a meeting in heaven that's why I'm saying you worship from your place of origin amen when there was a meeting in heaven we found this was activity here on Amen. Amen. Ahab wanted to go and fight and he insisted. &gt;&gt; God didn't like them. Then he called a meeting in heaven. When he called a meeting, one was saying this, another one was saying this. But the Bible says another spirit come before God and said to God, I will go and convince him to go to war so that he can die. And God said, how we going to do it? He said to God, I will put a lying spirit in his prophets. Those prophets will lie. and persuaded he persuaded him go to war. But where did this occur? In heaven. A lying spirit in heaven. Then God said to the lying spirit go. Then the lying spirit come down here and get into the prophet. And then the prophet started to prophesy. a prophet. Be careful when you are say you are a prophet or having the gift of the prophet doesn't have the lying spirit. You can lie to the people but you claiming to be the prophet. Not all the prophet are the prophet from God. prophet have the lying spirit and they will persuade you to do the wrong things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When something is happening here on earth activity in there's a meeting in heaven about you. Job experienced it like I experienced. There was a meeting in heaven. But there's a meeting in heaven about you. No wonder of God to protect you. The devil will do you know how because you worship from the right place from the place of your origin. If you're a child of God to begin with, you will remain a child of God. You will die being a child of God. Nothing can change you. So why are you worried this morning? If you are a sinner, I cannot change you. You will die s. And when you wake up from the dead, you will wake up being a sinner because the stand that you took when there was a war in heaven. That is why in the message of this hour we just say Lord God you know better. You pray harder. You fast you come to church. You do anything brothers and sisters doesn't going to change your status with God. Now tell me why are you woring this way? Because a complete job was done. Bible says the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world. What is the work of the lamb to die so that our sins can be forgiven? That means God knew very well. He will come to this earth. The sinful world will be shaped in iniquity. He will forgive us because he forgiven us before the foundation. Amen. Amen. Amen. God knew all those things and he started to prepare when you walk is God working. That is the ministry behind the Bible. But the ministry in the Bible in the New Testament is God with them. The ministry of the Old Testament was God above them. Ministry today was God in us. When you want to see God, look at us. We are God incarnate. I'm talking about God who created heaven and earth. He's in us [Music] is the ministry behind the Bible. Don't despise yourself. You are more than natural. As I was saying yesterday, &gt;&gt; sister Ford sister the brotherham says &gt;&gt; he was the poorest of the poor. &gt;&gt; But brother Brenham says is in heaven. For we say everything that you see with the naked eye beginning to all the wealth of the world acquire all you will leave them behind because they are tempor. [Music] God took them and at the right time God give them back to you. God was just trying to show you give you I can tell you I can give you I want to tell you this morning there's no neutral place. It's either you worship God or you worship Satan. And there are people, many people that worship Satan, but having the Bible in their head. But the Bible is not a confirmation of someone who a worshiper. A worship is someone who was a worshiper to begin with. Jesus was talking to the people. that knows the Bible that can quote the Bible. We call them priests high priest scribes. What we call intelligence of the day. He said to them, "You are from beneath." When they worship, &gt;&gt; they worship from beneath there's nothing they can do because the stand you took that day is the one that will sustain you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You sustained by the stent you took that time. [Music] Once more I say, why are you worrying today? What are you trying to make yourself? I'm telling you, relax. Relax in the word of God. A complete job was done. Just walk upon the path that God has created. Hey, they hate me. They don't want to talk to me. They don't want to phone me. They don't want to do this. Oh my. You will be admitted to the hospital. But if you can just say, "Lord God, you know it's better. Just continue. There's nothing and nothing in this world that you're going to change. You can change everything, anything. Everything that is happening meant to be like that. Even your prayer cannot change anything. If you think your prayer change something, I want to tell you this. It's not your prayer. It's God's prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was accusing us &gt;&gt; in the Old Testament. God gave him the opportunity. But when we come to the New Testament, ah, we met the master of the universe. I'm glad saying yesterday. The man of God says, "I've been all over the world. I've seen the religion of the people. I was in India. I saw how they worship. How they worship God, you know, in America, all those things. When I was looking all over the world, I want to tell you this. is at the highest level because the one we worship Jesus Christ died at the cross in the tomb that day is risen where it has ever happened in the human race. Never since the world began our Lord Jesus Christ follow that man was one of the days in Christ the resurrection is with the Lord Jesus Christens they've tried you can't wake up change your was there in the tomb. But where is the tomb of Jesus Christ? Open until the the soldiers were bought for lie stolen. They give money. This thing this thing of robbery &gt;&gt; did not start today. Amen. did not start today. Amen. Amen. He started long time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He started there. But you cannot hide the word of God. The more they receive those get exposed. You know the word of God exposes everything. Because the word of God is light. &gt;&gt; When you are a liar, you become more exposed. When you are a sinner, you become more exposed because the word of God exposes everything. When you are a Christian, you get exposed. These people started to see your life. your life changing people's life because we are here to impart life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I was listening here is saying she was just looking at just looking and leave. The following day she will look at her and leave and the third day and the fourth day maybe the fifth day that's when she said mama just tell me your secret you are alive is lied and we are here impart life they're liars they impart lives who they are who we are we are preaching in the sermon. &gt;&gt; But we are living. [Music] &gt;&gt; When you leave a sermon, &gt;&gt; you change the people's life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now Ephesians chapter 4, &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4 7-12, &gt;&gt; the Bible speaks about Jesus Christ. He said, it says he descended &gt;&gt; to the lower part and he ascended to the highest. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You know what he was doing? people that disbelieve the message during the time of Lord of Abraham of Noah of Enoch. He found them. &gt;&gt; He found them at the lower part. &gt;&gt; When you descend, you go down. And Jesus Christ said, "You are from beneath. You are from beneath. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they worship from beneath. We worship from above. Then he preached to them. The message that he preached to them was not the message of repentance because the message of repentance was for the children of God because they meant to repent. When Jesus died on the cross, did not die for every boat as we normally say died for those who took their part to Revelation 12. The rest you can preach it in your churches. He did not die for you. He died for those that were on the side. [Music] Those that were on the side of Lucifer, they can pray and pray hard and worship hard money. That does not going to make them Christian is going to make them good citizens citizens are not Christian but Christianity something else. You worship from your place of origin. &gt;&gt; Then they saw him coming there. They say, "Lord, it's time now. You see the demons knows him. They say, "Lord, now you are going to finish us off." Oh, &gt;&gt; they knew. &gt;&gt; Then he said to them, "No, &gt;&gt; I'm just coming here to tell you, &gt;&gt; remember is Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; when you deny Noah, &gt;&gt; you were denying me. &gt;&gt; When you deny Abraham, &gt;&gt; you were denying me. When you deny Enoch, you were denying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you deny the preaching this morning, you are denying him. &gt;&gt; He was telling them that. And when he get there, he broke the backbone of the devil. When he broke the backbone of the devil, he took the keys of death. took the keys of heaven.
