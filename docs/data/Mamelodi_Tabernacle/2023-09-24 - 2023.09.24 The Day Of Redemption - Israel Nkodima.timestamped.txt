[19:26] he left the other things
[19:30] you leave the other things
[19:39] you have been formed
[19:43] into their living image
[19:48] of the Living God
[19:52] you have hid from your theory
[19:55] [Music]
[20:01] you look at the Samaritan woman
[20:04] how she said
[20:12] I don't know what what do you know
[20:16] I know the Rapture is
[20:20] do you know something
[20:24] he she knew something yeah
[20:32] before something happens
[20:36] they are told of it
[20:39] I mean
[20:42] and
[20:44] she said I know Messiah yeah
[20:50] and even
[20:52] when he's coming
[20:55] he will tell us
[21:00] meaning that there was no church that
[21:04] could
[21:04] I mean
[21:10] he was just waiting for the Messiah yeah
[21:21] there are some people
[21:23] even here
[21:27] amen
[21:35] you can't tell them
[21:37] the difference because
[21:42] they did not only read about it
[21:48] you know that woman said I know
[22:10] foreign
[22:15] [Music]
[22:19] amen
[22:21] and
[22:23] she went further
[22:27] when he is
[22:30] a guy tell us all things
[22:35] because
[22:43] no
[22:46] I will be watching the times
[22:55] like I was reading this podcast
[23:00] there was Jubilee in heaven
[23:07] you know we are not alone I don't know
[23:12] we are here remove in this Realms
[23:19] available but there are some of us
[23:23] in the sixth dimensions
[23:30] you know when
[23:32] Paul was taken up one time
[23:38] and he said
[23:41] where was he
[23:47] how can men reach this they said
[23:57] you know it was a full Taste of things
[24:04] because that would
[24:06] we also living now experience
[24:19] of things
[24:22] now that's why you see us
[24:27] we are on pilgrimage
[24:30] because
[24:35] and
[24:42] he predestinated them
[24:45] and they are here on Earth
[24:49] don't you think that
[24:51] they have a full taste
[24:56] because the Bible says
[24:59] he predestinated us
[25:03] before really
[25:06] where is it brother
[25:11] he ordered predestinated us
[25:16] before penny
[25:18] that's why
[25:21] we are called the Overcomers
[25:27] because we can
[25:29] overcome whatever the world can produce
[25:36] or what Satan can do
[25:42] Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4. according
[25:45] as he have chosen Us in him before the
[25:49] foundation of the world
[25:52] he has chosen Us
[25:56] in him
[25:57] foreign
[26:27] [Music]
[26:42] and you know the Bible says we are not
[26:46] of the world
[26:48] the Lord Jesus said
[26:50] that is the Book of John chapter 17 yeah
[26:55] John chapter 17. he says
[27:00] they are not of the world
[27:03] and because
[27:07] possible
[27:22] we are strangers and surgeons
[27:26] in this world
[27:29] amen amen
[27:31] that's why
[27:33] your gospels should not just be a gospel
[27:40] it comes through predestination
[27:45] amen now
[27:47] he said it says Siri
[27:50] as he has chosen him
[27:59] meaning
[28:02] we were in him
[28:06] and he has chosen us amen
[28:13] all right amen
[28:15] that's why even in animals
[28:25] will try to fight a lion
[28:30] when it threatens to
[28:33] kill its chicks
[28:43] of this hand yeah who we
[28:46] are yeah there's a cog in this
[28:51] [Music]
[28:53] amen amen because these children were
[28:57] chosen
[28:59] she will fight
[29:03] because that is part of you
[29:07] that's why when
[29:10] we were insane
[29:21] meaning the family man
[29:32] foreign
[29:43] amen
[29:45] we were
[29:48] redeemed not to redeem
[29:51] is to bring back
[29:55] something that God lost
[30:00] now the only thing that can rule that
[30:03] thing
[30:17] amen
[30:18] [Music]
[30:22] amen amen
[30:24] through the blood come out we are family
[30:29] members
[30:32] [Music]
[30:34] Christ is not only God Messiah
[30:44] also it
[30:46] look
[30:52] sorry
[30:54] I don't know I mean
[30:57] amen amen if you want to keep along with
[31:00] Christ
[31:05] that can happen only if cells
[31:09] you are King to him
[31:14] I mean if he is
[31:35] I mean
[31:37] you see now now let me read this
[31:44] that's why here it says
[31:49] you've then been formed
[31:53] into the
[31:55] living image of the Living God
[32:02] because in Genesis
[32:13] image amen

[32:35] they you know that's why you see
[32:38] I'm here I won't go somewhere
[32:44] Christ is my image
[32:50] so when the time comes for me to worship
[32:54] Him
[32:59] that's why you you'll find me there

[35:02] the Lord said
[35:04] as it was
[35:12] [Music]
[35:14] when the son of man shall be revealed
[35:22] there were floods
[35:25] and I was reading the book

[37:10] this
[37:13] before the foundation of the world
[37:15] really how much as it says we were
[37:18] chosen before
[37:22] but chosen is
[37:28] amen you know a person who has chosen
[37:30] Island
[37:37] is not in the same league with a person
[37:39] who was
[37:41] chosen without us

[40:50] foreign
[41:18] until
[41:21] it reached in future
