[58:06] right amen the house
[58:10] that rude
[58:12] and over all that he had
[58:15] put I pray thee thy hand oh I mean
[58:23] they
[58:25] swear by the Lord the god of Heaven
[58:32] so you can see that it was a very
[58:34] serious
[58:35] thing here
[58:41] because we believe that marriage came
[58:44] from God
[58:50] is
[58:53] and God will bless us if we do things
[58:56] according to his words
[59:21] oh great
[59:23] I saw Charlie
[59:25] here we are okay Nava we are looking at
[59:28] times
[59:30] because we know that you still have to
[59:33] do some other things after this
[59:37] okay I mean but the what I'm trying to
[59:41] bring
[59:44] you is this
[59:48] he said
[59:50] allow me to repeat this
[59:57] four more
[1:00:01] country and to my Kindred and take a

[1:00:20] you shall take
[1:00:24] it will wait you
[1:00:26] you take easy
[1:00:28] to go and do something that is already
[1:00:31] there and has been planned to be what it
[1:00:35] is
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:00:44] because
[1:00:46] you know God has prepared the things
[1:00:51] God is Not Like Us
[1:00:54] sometimes we do things
[1:00:57] that we have not prepared foreign
[1:01:30] Corinthians
[1:01:32] okay here it is
[1:01:36] because it said really
[1:01:40] when he was
[1:01:43] confronted with this
[1:01:49] [Music]
[1:01:55] the priest said to him
[1:01:59] a man put away his wife
[1:02:05] another for any cause
[1:02:11] what is my brother here do you have your
[1:02:15] Corinthians there
[1:02:20] yes okay meanwhile
[1:02:23] we've seen how Abraham said
[1:02:42] you know
[1:02:44] God has prepared things
[1:02:47] before there was a time
[1:02:50] when God said let there be lights
[1:02:52] appeared
[1:03:00] and first thing he speaks then what
[1:03:04] follows is a manifestation
[1:03:07] of his mind yeah
[1:03:10] because when God speaks the word
[1:03:14] that is from that is his mind being
[1:03:18] manifested

[1:04:35] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[1:04:38] for every cause and he answered and said
[1:04:41] unto them have you not read that he wish
[1:04:44] made them
[1:04:46] at the beginning made them male and
[1:04:49] female and said for this cause shall a
[1:04:51] man live father and mother and shall
[1:04:54] cleave to his wife and their twin shall

[1:19:00] from the beginning
[1:19:02] the Lord Jesus Moses
[1:19:05] because of the happiness of yours
[1:19:09] in the beginning
[1:19:15] they said unto him why did Moses then
[1:19:18] command to give a writing of divorcement
[1:19:21] and to put her away
[1:19:23] he said unto them Moses because of the
[1:19:27] happiness of your heart suffered you to

[1:19:40] um
[1:19:52] we would be in a better position from

[1:19:57] is
[1:20:13] you were given the letter by the prophet
[1:20:16] Moses it is not so with God
