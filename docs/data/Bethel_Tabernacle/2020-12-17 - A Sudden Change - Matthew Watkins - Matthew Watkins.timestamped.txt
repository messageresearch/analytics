[46:43] bethel tabernacle soundbooth gmail.com
[46:45] got it okay praise the lord
[46:47] amen we have some quotes we'd like to
[46:49] display
[46:51] and then we'll have those just here in a
[46:52] moment i want to i've got a
[46:54] probably way too much uh here tonight to
[46:58] read
[46:58] i don't want to just read all night but
[47:00] i just uh the way the lord just dealt
[47:02] with me this afternoon was
[47:03] just in a very practical way a very
[47:07] uh much of a of a teaching way but
[47:09] that's all right that's just what the
[47:11] way the lord
[47:12] led me i believe that the rapture
[47:15] that we speak of this word uh that we
[47:18] used to speak of
[47:19] the coming of the lord and brother
[47:21] branham used those same exact
[47:23] words in in uh when he's speaking about
[47:25] the coming of the lord there was
[47:27] there's a lot the prophet had to say
[47:29] preaches an entire message
[47:30] called the rapture and uh i believe it's
[47:33] an important
[47:34] uh it's a it's an important topic that
[47:38] we could have
[47:38] as we look at the world and the
[47:40] condition of the world and where we are
[47:42] in time
[47:43] we know it must not be too much longer
[47:46] before some of these things that we read
[47:47] about
[47:48] that jesus just said come to pass i love
[47:51] that
[47:52] john 14 that we read where jesus says
[47:55] let not your hearts be troubled
[47:57] you believe in god believe also in me in
[48:00] my father's house are many mansions if
[48:02] it were not so i would have told you and
[48:04] then he says
[48:04] i go to prepare a place for you
[48:08] it's amazing because god prepares the
[48:10] earth in the beginning we find in
[48:12] genesis and it was a perfect world it
[48:15] didn't have any
[48:16] defect now we don't know that world
[48:19] we've never actually experienced that
[48:20] world at all
[48:21] the only the only way we relate to
[48:25] earth is under a curse that's that's all
[48:28] we've ever known in our entire in our
[48:29] life has been
[48:30] a world that's under a curse even our
[48:33] own body we know is subject to that same
[48:35] curse and disease and it's amazing
[48:38] because
[48:38] if you think about it even the earth
[48:41] that is under a curse that we've
[48:42] experienced
[48:43] yet it's a breathtaking beautiful
[48:47] glorious place to live you you go to
[48:50] some of the travel some of the parts of
[48:52] the world even
[48:52] here in the in our own city in beaufort
[48:55] and go over
[48:56] uh you know the bridge when the sun's
[48:58] going down or coming up it's beautiful
[49:00] and you think it just takes your breath
[49:02] away you have postcards
[49:03] and imagine that this is the earth under
[49:06] a curse
[49:07] imagine what it must be without a curse
[49:10] in other words if it's this good under a
[49:12] curse if it's this beautiful under a
[49:15] curse how
[49:16] good is it really the place that jesus
[49:19] said i'm going to prepare a place for
[49:21] you
[49:23] and so we know that he is go he's he's
[49:26] this is
[49:26] this is the type even the scripture here
[49:29] in 1st thessalonians 4
[49:31] we don't we're not going to teach on
[49:33] that here tonight but we know even the
[49:34] type of the jewish wedding
[49:36] where the there's the betrothal and then
[49:38] there's the purchase price and that
[49:40] and then there's the uh the there's the
[49:43] the engagement
[49:44] and then there's the shout to announce
[49:46] uh the
[49:47] the the the marriage and then the the
[49:49] bride uh goes through the bridegroom
[49:51] leaves and there's a waiting period
[49:53] before he comes back and we know
[49:55] all of these things are taking place
[49:57] right now
[49:58] that jesus said i'm gonna go but i'm
[50:01] going to prepare a place for you
[50:03] and if i go prepare a place for you then
[50:06] i will come again
[50:08] and receive you unto myself that where i
[50:11] am
[50:12] there you may be also
[50:16] first the first thessalonians the
[50:17] scripture that we read is is powerful
[50:19] and i'm going to get
[50:20] into just some of this here for a moment
[50:22] and i'm going to read some quotes here
[50:24] with good brothers if you just let me
[50:25] just mute that here for a second
[50:28] um there we go good i'm going to read
[50:30] something to you here because it's so
[50:32] amazing
[50:33] uh that there are cert certain people uh
[50:36] who are under the belief
[50:38] or and under the teaching that you know
[50:41] that
[50:41] uh that the rapture is uh the coming of
[50:44] the lord has already taken place there's
[50:45] actually people who believe that
[50:47] there's people who believe that the
[50:48] coming of the lord has always already
[50:50] taken place and that
[50:51] uh this is the tribulation right now the
[50:54] tribulation period has set in
[50:56] and that we're going through uh the
[50:58] tribulational signs right now
[51:00] and the the resurrection of the dead has
[51:02] already taken place
[51:04] and some people actually spiritualize
[51:06] that and say it was just a spiritual
[51:08] event but we know that first corinthians
[51:10] 15
[51:11] the apostle paul says without first
[51:13] corinthians 15
[51:14] if he be not raised then we're dead in
[51:16] our sins
[51:18] we have no hope thank you brother brad
[51:20] and and it's a it's
[51:21] it's amazing because let me just find my
[51:25] the place here the quote that i would
[51:26] like to read
[51:27] um it's amazing because brother branham
[51:30] covers this and
[51:31] you know there's even there's even the
[51:33] belief that
[51:34] that the rapture takes place after the
[51:37] tribulation
[51:38] post post rapture some people believe in
[51:41] a in a post rapture talking about
[51:42] christians in the world today
[51:44] who believe that the rapture takes place
[51:46] it's amazing because
[51:47] that is the same as to say that
[51:51] the the the groom has married the bride
[51:55] he's espoused her to himself
[51:58] and and so now that we're married now
[52:00] i'm gonna beat you
[52:01] uh to death i'm gonna i'm gonna
[52:03] physically abuse you
[52:06] and then afterwards we're gonna go have
[52:07] dinner and everything's gonna be fine
[52:11] really i mean really that's what you
[52:13] would have to believe
[52:14] if god was to send the church then his
[52:16] bride through the
[52:17] tribulation period i want to cover some
[52:20] of these i think it's really good here
[52:21] brother what brother brandon is speaking
[52:23] of
[52:23] and i'm just going to display these on
[52:25] the screen
[52:26] i want you to notice because it's going
[52:28] to be important
[52:30] as we read some of these that brother
[52:33] branham has
[52:34] a in his understanding that this is
[52:36] going to get a little teachy i got a lot
[52:38] so just follow real close here
[52:40] he has an understanding even amongst the
[52:43] pentecostal group that he's part of
[52:46] and it's it's it's vital to understand
[52:48] that brother branham
[52:49] even when you when you read the quote uh
[52:52] in the church age book and i'm going to
[52:53] read it i didn't have time to display it
[52:55] i'm just going to read it
[52:56] he says what seemed to be the answer
[52:58] came as
[53:00] many begin to speak in tongues and
[53:02] manifest
[53:03] gifts of the spirit now he's referring
[53:06] to the pentecostal revival
[53:08] in this quote here in the church age
[53:10] he's referring to the pentecostal
[53:11] revival and the
[53:12] and the the latter rain movement uh
[53:15] pentecostal movement
[53:17] and then he refers to the 1906 azusa
[53:20] street
[53:21] outpouring of the spirit of god the
[53:23] restoration of gifts
[53:24] and brother branham says what seemed to
[53:26] be the answer
[53:28] came as many begin to speak in tongues
[53:30] and manifest gifts of the spirit
[53:32] it was then believed that this was the
[53:35] indeed
[53:36] long-awaited restoration now when he
[53:39] says it was
[53:40] it was then believed brother branham was
[53:43] one of those
[53:44] in that group who actually believed that
[53:49] so when you read things like brother
[53:50] branham is saying we're going to read
[53:52] some of these quotations here in a
[53:53] minute from 55
[53:55] he comes under that same exact thinking
[53:58] that that the the pentecostal movement
[54:01] that he was part of
[54:02] was the long-awaited restoration and so
[54:05] when he says it was then believed that
[54:07] this was indeed the long-awaited
[54:08] resurrection the restoration he says
[54:10] it was not so the lord corrects him on
[54:12] that but he says it was not for the
[54:14] latter rain can only come
[54:15] until after the teaching rain after the
[54:18] former rain which is the spring or
[54:19] teaching rain
[54:20] the latter rain then is the harvest rain
[54:22] he says how can this be the real when
[54:24] the teaching reign had not come the
[54:26] prophet messenger is to be sent to teach
[54:27] the people and turn the hearts of the
[54:28] children
[54:29] to the pentecostal fathers had not yet
[54:30] come thus
[54:32] what was thought to be the restoration
[54:35] and the final quickening unto the
[54:37] rapture had not come
[54:39] and so he says what was thought to
[54:40] believe so what was
[54:42] what was thought to be it's important
[54:46] because brother branham thought to be
[54:48] even himself up until a certain point
[54:50] before the seals
[54:52] you have to understand that some of the
[54:54] things that the prophet
[54:56] says prior to the seals do we call chuck
[54:58] them out no
[54:59] but you've got to understand it in the
[55:01] light of pre-seals
[55:03] so god hasn't came and revealed this
[55:05] this the the word is not even an open
[55:07] book to him
[55:08] he's there's a lot of baptist theology
[55:10] now listen before we just get too much
[55:12] in that let's just read
[55:13] he says what we need today i believe
[55:16] first is some good old-fashioned
[55:17] persecution
[55:19] to run us together we find out
[55:22] that when the church is really
[55:24] persecuted i believe that god is
[55:26] permitting communism to hit the land so
[55:28] he says what we need is persecution now
[55:31] you're going to see a lot of these
[55:32] things grouped up here
[55:34] some of these comments that brother
[55:35] brandon makes are
[55:37] almost sound exactly the same watch in
[55:40] the great commission but i believe my
[55:42] brethren
[55:43] that there's come in an hour that when a
[55:46] real
[55:46] rank persecution will run us together
[55:51] then we will be one the church will come
[55:55] together
[55:56] i believe it's all in the making of god
[56:00] after painting this picture now remember
[56:02] when you're reading these
[56:03] brother branham has a denominational
[56:07] view
[56:08] of the bible he has a denomination a
[56:11] baptist view
[56:12] of the white horse writer now y'all are
[56:15] quiet but just i'm gonna i'm giving you
[56:17] something these are gonna pop here
[56:18] it's getting light bulbs gonna come on
[56:19] in a minute brother branham has a
[56:21] denominational view
[56:22] of the rapture he has a denominational
[56:25] view
[56:26] of the church ages now when you say
[56:29] denominational uh uh church view baptist
[56:32] view
[56:33] it wasn't that any of those views were
[56:35] the wrong answer and then he got the
[56:37] right answer
[56:38] brother adam says that the the message
[56:40] of the hour was the restoration
[56:42] of the word all of the loose ends
[56:46] to be tied back together so the message
[56:50] isn't
[56:50] new it's not something that happened in
[56:52] 1947
[56:54] it's not something that ended in 1965
[56:56] but it was a restoration
[56:58] of the truth that the truth is not a
[57:01] book it's not a doctrine the truth is
[57:04] not a teaching
[57:05] the truth is we've preached many times
[57:07] is jesus christ
[57:09] who said i am the truth and so the
[57:12] truth that we received through the
[57:13] message was not a new idea
[57:15] new theory new revelation it was a
[57:18] restoration
[57:20] that was the message and there's another
[57:22] point i want to make to you here tonight
[57:24] the the the the the messenger
[57:27] this is the message is not william
[57:29] branham's message
[57:33] amos's message when amos came and amos
[57:35] one and he begins to cry out in amos
[57:37] four and he begins to cry against israel
[57:40] amos was just the mailman it wasn't
[57:43] amos's message when jeremiah begins to
[57:45] cry out against jerusalem
[57:47] and he says go into the street see if
[57:48] there be any who seek god see if anybody
[57:50] who looked to the ancient ways
[57:52] that's not jeremiah's message that's the
[57:55] message
[57:56] from god to his servant the prophet who
[57:59] becomes the mouthpiece
[58:01] jeremiah was just the mailman
[58:04] so the message of the hour brother adams
[58:06] the the message that we read you open
[58:08] the table you turn on the book you turn
[58:10] on the tape
[58:10] this is not the message of william
[58:12] branham this is the message of jesus
[58:15] christ
[58:16] who he used the vessel to speak through
[58:18] but let me just say this
[58:20] when it wasn't jeremiah's message though
[58:22] it wasn't amos's message though it
[58:24] wasn't nehemiah
[58:26] or haggai's message though it wasn't
[58:28] isaiah's message it was the message from
[58:30] god
[58:30] but to reject isaiah was to reject
[58:35] god to reject jeremiah was not to reject
[58:39] jeremiah
[58:40] you weren't rejecting amos you were
[58:42] rejecting
[58:43] jehovah amen amen
[58:47] and so the message of the hours just
[58:50] just like the sermon of the minister you
[58:52] that's why it's
[58:53] to get mad at the preacher you're just
[58:54] getting mad at the mailman he's just
[58:56] delivering the mail
[58:59] he's just giving you the message that
[59:00] god gave him so how could we get upset
[59:03] with him
[59:06] and so brother branham as we said he has
[59:08] a he he believes at this time
[59:10] that the white horse rider is christ
[59:14] that's what he believes now god goes and
[59:17] changes him right hello
[59:22] and so he believes this prior then god
[59:24] corrects him now watch
[59:25] now when you're reading some of these
[59:26] things just remember that
[59:28] because he's going to start referring to
[59:31] persecution coming
[59:33] there's a persecution coming there's
[59:35] when they hunt us down like dogs oh
[59:37] when the squeeze really comes on watch
[59:39] the third pool then now watch all of
[59:40] these things and take them in their
[59:41] right context watch
[59:43] he says i believe my brother there's
[59:45] come in an hour the real rank
[59:46] persecution we read that one let's go
[59:48] forward
[59:48] and oh i would have abs uh okay that's
[59:51] that's a little too far let me
[59:52] let me make sure i might have got that
[59:53] one out of order
[59:56] yeah okay in a paradox he says how are
[59:58] we going to lose this great race it's
[1:00:01] because we're divided
[1:00:02] how are we going to do it we got to stay
[1:00:04] together we're all believers in god the
[1:00:06] holy ghost takes us all in
[1:00:07] it'll be a paradox if god ever gets us
[1:00:09] together but he will just trust him the
[1:00:11] virgin both
[1:00:12] birth he knows how to send the
[1:00:14] persecution
[1:00:16] that will run us together he knows how
[1:00:20] to send the persecution
[1:00:21] that will run us together now watch the
[1:00:24] year 64
[1:00:26] april right amen now i want you to
[1:00:29] notice what happens
[1:00:30] prior to the seals listen to this in the
[1:00:32] first seal because remember as we
[1:00:34] said this is not this is battery might
[1:00:37] be going dead here guys
[1:00:39] remember what we said that brother
[1:00:40] branham it's not when he preaches the
[1:00:42] seals is not his message
[1:00:43] he has a he has a a a a church view
[1:00:47] of the bible but watch what he says here
[1:00:49] in the first seal
[1:00:50] backing up here oh i would have
[1:00:53] absolutely today and i hope that people
[1:00:56] are spiritual
[1:00:57] i would have made a horrible mistake
[1:01:02] on that i would have made a horrible
[1:01:05] mistake on that
[1:01:07] if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today
[1:01:10] when the holy spirit came in the room
[1:01:12] and corrected me on something that i was
[1:01:16] writing down to say amen
[1:01:20] so what you find is is that even brother
[1:01:22] branham let me make sure my notes are in
[1:01:24] conte in sync with this so that i don't
[1:01:26] miss something here
[1:01:29] so so brother madam even before the
[1:01:31] seals he says i was going to make a
[1:01:33] terrible mistake but the lord corrected
[1:01:34] him so watch go
[1:01:36] a little bit further he says he knows
[1:01:38] how to run we're to have a persecution
[1:01:40] that'll run us together
[1:01:42] he says in a court trial and there is
[1:01:44] where i knew all the pentecostal groups
[1:01:46] come together then it'll take a
[1:01:48] persecution to run you people together
[1:01:50] you'll never believe it
[1:01:52] but when that time comes and so
[1:01:56] what you've had is is you've had groups
[1:01:58] of people
[1:01:59] large groups of people who have taken
[1:02:02] some of the things that brother branham
[1:02:04] said and said
[1:02:04] oh what what's coming is persecution
[1:02:08] what's going to happen next is they've
[1:02:10] got to shut the doors to the church and
[1:02:11] they've got to lock them up and we've
[1:02:13] got to be persecuted we've got to
[1:02:14] throw we've got to be thrown into jail
[1:02:16] we've got to be martyred
[1:02:18] we there's got to be a persecution
[1:02:19] brother madam said there's got to be
[1:02:20] persecution to run us together
[1:02:22] and so what the reason say why is that
[1:02:24] dangerous because it gives a person the
[1:02:26] wrong
[1:02:27] expectation of what to look for next
[1:02:30] amen because the believer we are
[1:02:33] commanded not just by the message but by
[1:02:35] the bible
[1:02:36] to not live in expectation for
[1:02:39] persecution
[1:02:40] but to live in the expectation of the
[1:02:43] coming of the lord jesus
[1:02:46] do you know that this is actually
[1:02:47] commanded in the bible
[1:02:50] in in philippians i and i don't i don't
[1:02:52] have them on the screen so i'm going to
[1:02:53] mute this and you don't try to follow me
[1:02:55] it's two i'll go through them too quick
[1:02:57] and in philippians 3 20
[1:03:00] i'm going to read these just fast he
[1:03:01] says but we are citizens
[1:03:04] of heaven where the lord jesus christ
[1:03:07] lives and we
[1:03:08] are earnestly eagerly waiting for him to
[1:03:12] return
[1:03:14] as our savior that was philippians
[1:03:17] here's titus 2
[1:03:18] 13. looking looking
[1:03:22] looking for expecting that
[1:03:25] blessed hope now what is that blessed
[1:03:28] hope he's referring to what we just
[1:03:30] read in first thessalonians what we read
[1:03:32] in john
[1:03:34] that if i go and prepare a place
[1:03:37] i will come back to receive you that is
[1:03:40] the blessed hope that titus is referring
[1:03:42] to here looking for
[1:03:44] that blessed hope and the glorious
[1:03:47] appearing of the great god and our
[1:03:49] savior jesus christ
[1:03:51] so what is it as a believer you are
[1:03:54] taught by the bible
[1:03:55] to live in an expectation of the
[1:03:58] imminent return of the lord jesus
[1:04:03] first thessalonians one or hebrews 9 28
[1:04:07] so christ was once offered to bear the
[1:04:08] sins of many and unto them and
[1:04:10] unto them that look for him
[1:04:15] shall he appear the second time without
[1:04:18] sin unto salvation who's the lord jesus
[1:04:20] going to repair appeared to in the
[1:04:21] rapture
[1:04:23] the bible just told us not to the whole
[1:04:25] world
[1:04:26] amen amen as people think he's just
[1:04:29] going to come down and the big great
[1:04:30] you know uh red carpet is going to roll
[1:04:33] from the sky and then the clouds and
[1:04:34] everybody there will be when when all
[1:04:36] the world does see you
[1:04:38] but the bible speaks of in first
[1:04:39] thessalonians 4. i'm just going to quote
[1:04:41] it here for a minute
[1:04:43] it says in first thessalonians 4 it says
[1:04:45] i would not have you
[1:04:46] uh be ignorant brother uh let me just
[1:04:49] find my place here
[1:04:50] and he says for the lord himself shall
[1:04:52] to sin with
[1:04:54] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[1:04:56] of the archangel with the trump of god
[1:04:58] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:05:01] then we which are alive and remain
[1:05:04] shall be called up together amen
[1:05:08] now that word cult is the greek word
[1:05:10] harpazo
[1:05:12] and that greek word harpazo is a
[1:05:14] physical
[1:05:15] snatching that's what it means
[1:05:18] so read it again here he says then we
[1:05:21] which are alive
[1:05:22] and remain this is at the coming of the
[1:05:24] lord this is at the rapture of the
[1:05:25] church this is at the body change
[1:05:27] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:05:30] be snatched
[1:05:31] we shall be pulled away we shall be
[1:05:34] called up together
[1:05:37] with them now this is not spiritual if
[1:05:39] you go look up harpazo it's physical
[1:05:41] it's very it's very tangible it's more
[1:05:43] of the word it's something
[1:05:45] a substantive event that actually takes
[1:05:47] place
[1:05:48] we shall be caught up together with them
[1:05:53] so when he says the lord himself shouted
[1:05:55] sin so what is the rapture in first
[1:05:57] thessalonians 4 the lord himself shouted
[1:05:59] sin with a shout
[1:06:00] what is a shout it's a shout to a
[1:06:02] message to get the people ready
[1:06:04] and he says then with the voice of the
[1:06:06] archangel and the trump of god or the
[1:06:08] dead in christ shall rise
[1:06:09] then we which are alive so someone's
[1:06:11] going to be here that's what the bible
[1:06:13] says
[1:06:13] there will be somebody alive there has
[1:06:16] to be
[1:06:18] there has to be because people have been
[1:06:19] dying and dying and dying and dying and
[1:06:21] dying but there will be a group of
[1:06:22] people
[1:06:23] at the coming of the lord first
[1:06:25] thessalonians 4 we which
[1:06:27] are alive and remain
[1:06:31] so there's a real physical people who
[1:06:33] really
[1:06:34] will not die they won't taste death
[1:06:39] it's not the only that's that's actually
[1:06:41] you know just a few and
[1:06:42] we're just we we could take time to read
[1:06:44] a lot of these but we're just going to
[1:06:46] save it here for tonight
[1:06:47] but i want you to look here even even
[1:06:49] did you know that even in the bible
[1:06:52] uh that that's that this this there's
[1:06:55] been
[1:06:56] seven different times that the right
[1:06:58] that the rapture is mentioned seven
[1:07:00] different times that we could name a few
[1:07:03] just in the rapture of of elisha
[1:07:05] who the bible says who walked with god
[1:07:07] and and he was or enoch who walked with
[1:07:09] god and he was not
[1:07:11] he was not he was raptured he was taken
[1:07:13] for he had this testimony that he
[1:07:15] pleased the lord
[1:07:16] you think of elijah you can think of
[1:07:19] even it's amazing because even in acts
[1:07:21] chapter 8 verse 39
[1:07:23] it says when they came up out of the
[1:07:25] water the spirit of the lord
[1:07:27] suddenly took snatched called up
[1:07:31] philip away and the eunuch did not see
[1:07:33] him again but went on his way rejoicing
[1:07:35] and then philip appears in another city
[1:07:38] philip just magically disappears
[1:07:42] so you think you think it there there's
[1:07:43] a way it's not just so what's going to
[1:07:45] happen
[1:07:46] when god raptures his church we shall be
[1:07:49] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:07:51] harponzo
[1:07:52] snatched up called up taken away
[1:07:57] there'll be a group of people who have a
[1:07:59] sudden change suddenly
[1:08:00] everything changes he says suddenly took
[1:08:04] philip away and the eunuch did not see
[1:08:05] him again but went
[1:08:06] on his way rejoicing
[1:08:09] you think of second corinthians 12 when
[1:08:11] the apostle paul says
[1:08:13] he says i've ca i've had revelations and
[1:08:15] visions he said i knew a man
[1:08:17] even once and paul's speaking in the
[1:08:19] third person
[1:08:20] and he's speaking about himself he says
[1:08:22] who was called up that same same exact
[1:08:24] thing that philip happened to philip
[1:08:26] paul says whether in the body or not i
[1:08:29] don't know
[1:08:31] was he in the in the in the i don't know
[1:08:33] he said i don't know so he
[1:08:35] we don't know he said i don't know
[1:08:37] whether the body you're out of the body
[1:08:39] i don't know
[1:08:40] he says but he was called up to the to
[1:08:42] to paradise
[1:08:44] and he says and i heard things that are
[1:08:46] not lawful
[1:08:48] to speak about and so even the apostle
[1:08:51] paul
[1:08:51] is raptured is pulled out of this
[1:08:53] dimension now where where what it was a
[1:08:55] vision he says or not i don't know
[1:08:58] and so we we we know here even the book
[1:09:01] of revelation
[1:09:02] it says here in revelations 12 5 7 she
[1:09:04] brought forth a man child who was the
[1:09:05] rule of nations with the right of the
[1:09:06] earth and her child was called up
[1:09:08] unto god that that word that same exact
[1:09:11] word there
[1:09:12] is is used in thessalonians when it says
[1:09:14] for the lord himself shall descend
[1:09:16] then we which are alive shall be caught
[1:09:18] up together with him in the clouds to
[1:09:21] meet the lord in the air and so
[1:09:23] shall we ever be with the lord amen
[1:09:26] wherefore comfort one another
[1:09:31] with these words
[1:09:35] now the only people who need comfort are
[1:09:39] not those that are comfortable
[1:09:40] here that's why these words don't mean
[1:09:42] anything to those people who are
[1:09:44] comfortable here
[1:09:46] if you're comfortable here and you see a
[1:09:49] utopian
[1:09:50] world and everything in this life is
[1:09:52] just here and i get all i can get here
[1:09:54] then really you don't need these words
[1:09:57] that's why so many people
[1:09:58] aren't expecting they're they're not
[1:10:00] living under the expectation
[1:10:03] of the coming of the lord listen
[1:10:06] he says here further in first
[1:10:07] thessalonians 4 1 verse 10
[1:10:10] and to wait for his son from heaven
[1:10:14] who he who he raised from the dead even
[1:10:16] jesus which delivered us from the wrath
[1:10:17] to come first thessalonians 5 6
[1:10:19] therefore let us not sleep
[1:10:22] as do others but let us watch
[1:10:27] and be sober let us watch
[1:10:31] that means to eagerly wait
[1:10:34] to live in expectation
[1:10:37] to live in constant expectation what is
[1:10:40] the bible saying it's saying that a
[1:10:41] believer
[1:10:42] will conduct your life in a moment by
[1:10:46] moment expectancy of the return of the
[1:10:49] lord jesus
[1:10:51] it's actually commanded of us watch
[1:10:54] be sober we're citizens of heaven we are
[1:10:57] eagerly waiting for our savior
[1:10:58] titus looking for that looking for that
[1:11:01] blessed hope and the glorious appearing
[1:11:03] hebrews 9 he shall appear unto them
[1:11:06] that look for him shall he appear unto
[1:11:08] them for the second time without sin
[1:11:10] unto salvation
[1:11:11] first thessalonians let us not sleep as
[1:11:13] do others let us watch and be sober
[1:11:15] let us live in expectation let us
[1:11:17] conduct ourself by
[1:11:19] in a moment by moment expectancy yes
[1:11:22] amen for the return of the lord
[1:11:26] it should these these kind of things
[1:11:29] should
[1:11:30] stir us up in our own heart to ask our
[1:11:32] all of us
[1:11:33] a question are we living are we
[1:11:36] conducting our daily life
[1:11:39] in a moment by moment expectation for
[1:11:41] the lord's return
[1:11:42] amen are we
[1:11:47] er it's amazing to me that that that
[1:11:51] this is the hour when we see the entire
[1:11:53] world falling apart more than we
[1:11:56] ever have in our lifetime coming apart
[1:11:58] at the seams more uncertainty and fear
[1:12:01] gripping the world
[1:12:03] and and this is the hour where we open
[1:12:06] our bible and we read
[1:12:08] and it says assemble yourselves more so
[1:12:14] as you see the day approaching and
[1:12:17] somehow
[1:12:19] we're assembled less
[1:12:23] somehow our numbers are just talking
[1:12:25] physically here
[1:12:26] our numbers on wednesday nights and on
[1:12:28] sunday mornings are less than they were
[1:12:30] prior to 20.
[1:12:32] think about this just for a moment our
[1:12:35] not just speaking of our own church and
[1:12:37] not not here to
[1:12:38] to to to impugn or label anybody or
[1:12:41] criticize anybody but just just this
[1:12:42] should
[1:12:43] sober us here for a moment churches
[1:12:45] across the nation
[1:12:48] when when a world is unraveling and the
[1:12:50] world is coming apart
[1:12:52] and the bible says when you say when
[1:12:55] jesus says when you shall see these
[1:12:56] things look up
[1:12:58] for your redemption dwelleth not look up
[1:13:00] in other words what's he saying look to
[1:13:02] the promises of god
[1:13:04] amen look up don't look down
[1:13:08] don't look around
[1:13:11] that's what we have a really hard time
[1:13:13] not doing
[1:13:15] is we have a hard time not looking
[1:13:17] around
[1:13:19] and we can get so entrenched and so
[1:13:21] right just wound up
[1:13:24] with the news with the media with social
[1:13:27] media
[1:13:28] with what's happening in the white house
[1:13:29] with what's happening in the election
[1:13:30] what's happening over here what's that
[1:13:32] and and we're looking around yeah and
[1:13:35] then if you're not looking around you're
[1:13:36] looking down
[1:13:39] and you're thinking oh my what's gonna
[1:13:40] happen oh what's what's next
[1:13:42] but jesus says don't look around don't
[1:13:44] look down look up
[1:13:47] look up for your redemption draw nigh
[1:13:51] and in the hour when when the bible says
[1:13:53] when you see these things approaching
[1:13:56] a symbol you're a symbol you know i
[1:13:59] think it was
[1:14:00] it was i i i believed i'm just gonna
[1:14:03] make the statement
[1:14:04] prior to 2020
[1:14:07] prior to 2020 i thought i knew why that
[1:14:10] scripture was in the bible now i
[1:14:13] definitely know why that scripture was
[1:14:14] in the bible
[1:14:16] when a time when where before we didn't
[1:14:19] as you see the day approaching assemble
[1:14:20] yourselves more we're already assembled
[1:14:22] so now more than ever before at a time
[1:14:25] of separation and dislocation of people
[1:14:28] and believers we should take the
[1:14:30] challenge of the word of god to say
[1:14:32] assemble yourself in the house of god
[1:14:34] more so more than you ever have before
[1:14:39] more than you ever have before
[1:14:44] john first john 3 behold what manner of
[1:14:46] love
[1:14:47] the father hath bestowed upon us that we
[1:14:50] should be called the sons of god
[1:14:51] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:14:53] because it knew him not beloved
[1:14:56] now right now
[1:15:00] are we the sons of god and he says and
[1:15:03] it doth not yet appear
[1:15:05] what we shall be but
[1:15:09] we know that when he shall appear
[1:15:13] we shall be like him
[1:15:17] for we shall see him as he
[1:15:21] is now notice what he says in the next
[1:15:24] verse
[1:15:25] and every man that hath this hope
[1:15:29] this is the same hope and titus when he
[1:15:31] says looking for
[1:15:32] that blessed hope this is the same thing
[1:15:34] that that in the thessalonians paul said
[1:15:37] let us not sleep as to others but let us
[1:15:39] watch and be sober let us have an
[1:15:41] expectation
[1:15:42] he says every man that hath this hope in
[1:15:44] him purifieth
[1:15:46] himself even as the lord is pure
[1:15:53] what do you do when you live under an
[1:15:55] expectation of the lord jesus you purify
[1:15:58] yourself
[1:16:01] this is real simple when you're living
[1:16:04] when we are living a life expecting the
[1:16:06] coming of the lord
[1:16:08] it draws us to sanctification
[1:16:12] it draws us to purify our thoughts and
[1:16:14] our mind and our words and our spirit
[1:16:16] and our attitudes
[1:16:18] when we lose that expectation and we're
[1:16:21] not expecting we're not
[1:16:22] living like he's coming tomorrow then
[1:16:25] there's a lack of purification
[1:16:29] amen amen two plus two equals four
[1:16:35] it's real simple if you live like the
[1:16:38] lord's coming tomorrow
[1:16:39] you're living close to the lord you're
[1:16:41] purifying every man that hath this whole
[1:16:43] purified himself
[1:16:46] so when we get to a state to where we're
[1:16:48] not living constantly under the fountain
[1:16:50] or to where we're not living constantly
[1:16:52] under the presence of god where we're
[1:16:53] not daily communion with the lord it's
[1:16:55] because
[1:16:56] we've lost sight of this
[1:16:59] hope are you here tonight amen
[1:17:04] let's pick this back up here brother
[1:17:06] adam says here
[1:17:07] he says and he says this is where i knew
[1:17:09] all the pentecostal groups come together
[1:17:11] they'll take a persecution
[1:17:12] it'll take a persecution to run you
[1:17:15] people together you never believe it but
[1:17:16] when that time comes
[1:17:18] so when you give a person a false
[1:17:21] expectation
[1:17:23] when you're expecting the wrong thing
[1:17:25] what do we just read about in the bible
[1:17:28] what is the next event what is the
[1:17:30] expectation
[1:17:31] the coming of the lord listen to what
[1:17:33] brother branham says here in questions
[1:17:34] and answers brother branham
[1:17:36] this now notice this is april this is
[1:17:39] april paradox april court trial now we
[1:17:42] come to august
[1:17:43] brother branham will the bride go
[1:17:45] through the persecution
[1:17:47] as the early apostolic church did i want
[1:17:49] to mute the screen for a moment because
[1:17:51] i don't think we could make this
[1:17:53] any more clear of a question and we
[1:17:56] definitely could not have a clearer
[1:17:57] answer to a clear question
[1:18:01] this should end all argument
[1:18:06] brother man will the bride go through
[1:18:08] the persecution as the early apostolic
[1:18:10] church did
[1:18:13] amen no
[1:18:18] if there was any moment that he needed
[1:18:20] to inject something there to say well
[1:18:22] they've got a
[1:18:23] there's a persecution coming to run us
[1:18:25] together to now you remember
[1:18:27] you'll see here in a moment brother
[1:18:28] branham comes from that pentecostal
[1:18:30] group who's thinking that the latter
[1:18:32] former
[1:18:32] the the latter rain movement is the
[1:18:34] indeed long-awaited restoration
[1:18:37] and then he says but it was thought to
[1:18:39] be but he realized it was not
[1:18:41] and so he makes he makes statements
[1:18:43] about the persecution coming
[1:18:45] about a tribulation about the bride
[1:18:47] suffering
[1:18:48] and and and listen listen to what he
[1:18:50] says here he says no
[1:18:52] i just explained that a few minutes ago
[1:18:54] no
[1:18:55] next thing is a rapture now
[1:19:01] next thing is rapture there's going to
[1:19:04] be many
[1:19:04] things that follow the rapture but the
[1:19:07] next thing
[1:19:08] is the rapture many things are
[1:19:11] subsequent to the rapture but the next
[1:19:13] thing for you and for me
[1:19:15] is the rapture
[1:19:18] you know why that you know why that
[1:19:20] gives me such joy
[1:19:22] because that takes away all fear of
[1:19:25] anything that's going to happen to this
[1:19:27] world
[1:19:28] because what happens to me next does it
[1:19:31] what happens to them doesn't happen to
[1:19:32] me
[1:19:33] how do you know brother matt because
[1:19:34] i've already read what happens to me
[1:19:36] next
[1:19:37] the rapture hallelujah
[1:19:40] he says remember we're at the promised
[1:19:42] land where the border you understand the
[1:19:44] march of israel listen to this now
[1:19:45] notice
[1:19:46] but i was just thinking this is now this
[1:19:47] is the fifth seal listen what brother
[1:19:48] brandon says i love this quote right
[1:19:50] here
[1:19:50] let me pull it up here on my screen
[1:19:53] he says he says
[1:19:57] notice but i was just thinking is this
[1:19:58] precious godly brother john i just
[1:20:00] thought it would be a good place to
[1:20:01] inject that
[1:20:02] just before closing see if john looked
[1:20:04] over there and them
[1:20:05] was of his brethren see his brethren
[1:20:07] that had to suffer a little
[1:20:09] then see the lord god permitted the lord
[1:20:11] god
[1:20:12] permitted me to see my brethren and the
[1:20:15] saints
[1:20:16] that were waiting for the coming of the
[1:20:19] lord
[1:20:19] now did you ever catch this brother
[1:20:22] branham says i seen my brethren remember
[1:20:24] over there he says the who are these
[1:20:26] people is these branhams he said no
[1:20:27] these are not brandons these are your
[1:20:29] converts those that you led to the lord
[1:20:31] now watch him watch this
[1:20:33] he says i seen my people i see them
[1:20:36] and he says i seen my brethren and say
[1:20:39] well i'm not brother adam's brother i
[1:20:40] guess he didn't see me
[1:20:42] and them that were waiting for the
[1:20:43] coming of the lord
[1:20:45] i'm in that number he says
[1:20:49] notice they were not under the altar of
[1:20:52] sacrifice
[1:20:53] mine wasn't but these was they were
[1:20:56] martyrs
[1:20:57] see mine wasn't under the martyr's
[1:21:00] altar wow now i want you to listen real
[1:21:04] close and i'll close honest just about
[1:21:06] in 10 minutes 10 o'clock and i'll just
[1:21:07] cut it off and finish it tomorrow look
[1:21:09] they were not my the ones that the lord
[1:21:12] showed me the bride she was not under
[1:21:15] the martyr's block
[1:21:16] no the sacrifice altar of the martyrs
[1:21:19] but
[1:21:19] had received white robes by accepting
[1:21:21] the pardoning grace of the living word
[1:21:24] christ had given them a white robe
[1:21:28] now he comes to you you notice we read
[1:21:30] in sixth in
[1:21:31] in august in questions and answers but
[1:21:34] there was a very important
[1:21:36] message that precedes
[1:21:39] questions and answers and it's the
[1:21:41] message the feast of the trumpets
[1:21:44] wonderful message i would recommend it
[1:21:47] if you have want something to listen to
[1:21:48] this week
[1:21:50] he comes to this mat this message here
[1:21:52] and i'm trying to make sure i have it
[1:21:54] here on mine
[1:21:58] i do right here he says oh
[1:22:02] don't you see where we're at don't you
[1:22:05] see why them trumpets means
[1:22:07] nothing to us they all sounded under our
[1:22:11] sick seal you see now why the holy
[1:22:13] spirit wouldn't let me speak it
[1:22:14] and the heavenly father knows with the
[1:22:17] bible before me that's the truth
[1:22:20] so brother branham just pause for that
[1:22:22] for a moment before the seals what did
[1:22:24] we read he said i would have made a
[1:22:26] horrible mistake
[1:22:28] and he said i had it all written out i
[1:22:29] was just about to write it down and the
[1:22:31] angel of the lord came and corrected me
[1:22:32] and then he comes out each night before
[1:22:35] the seals
[1:22:36] each night the angel of the lord comes
[1:22:38] and corrects brother branham and gives
[1:22:40] him the revelation of that seal
[1:22:42] and then he preaches it so it's not his
[1:22:44] message it's the message from the throne
[1:22:46] of god
[1:22:47] and he says i would have made a horrible
[1:22:49] mistake but god corrected me now
[1:22:51] and he says that was important now we
[1:22:53] would all agree of that we would all
[1:22:55] hear as believers
[1:22:56] we would say this the seals to brother
[1:22:58] branham was the opening of the
[1:23:00] remember he says the bible becomes a
[1:23:02] brand new book
[1:23:04] it becomes a brand new book you can see
[1:23:06] jesus in every verse from the beginning
[1:23:08] to the end
[1:23:09] so everything in previous church light
[1:23:11] everything he had looked at under church
[1:23:13] revelation and church light anything
[1:23:16] that was wrong brother branham
[1:23:17] starts as the angel lord begins to
[1:23:19] correct him he comes and changes the
[1:23:21] white horse rider says it wasn't christ
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:23:25] now watch what he does right before
[1:23:27] preaching in the uh he he he he believes
[1:23:30] brother and believes you know the he
[1:23:31] preaches the seven seals now he thinks
[1:23:33] okay now i've got to preach the seven
[1:23:35] trumpets
[1:23:35] buys a plane ticket you remember this
[1:23:39] and the holy spirit stops him and says
[1:23:41] it's not your it's not the time it's not
[1:23:43] your place
[1:23:45] now he's thinking this entire time i've
[1:23:47] got it and you can see what's under the
[1:23:49] trumpets
[1:23:50] you could see how brother branham says
[1:23:52] what the seven seals are to
[1:23:54] the gentiles the seven trumpets are to
[1:23:57] the jews
[1:23:58] now watch what he says here and he says
[1:24:01] oh don't you see don't you see why them
[1:24:03] trumpets mean nothing to us
[1:24:05] they all sounded under the sixth seal
[1:24:07] you see now why the holy spirit wouldn't
[1:24:08] let me speak it
[1:24:10] as the heavenly father knows with this
[1:24:11] bible before me
[1:24:13] that's the truth didn't know it
[1:24:16] till yesterday
[1:24:20] so this is 7 19 in the morning on
[1:24:23] sunday i believe this is a sunday
[1:24:25] morning so on
[1:24:26] saturday till yesterday day before
[1:24:30] yesterday
[1:24:30] in my room there was been friday where
[1:24:34] he revealed it
[1:24:35] come to me spoke to me i come back
[1:24:38] said wife i got it now he just met me in
[1:24:42] there and told me here it is honey see
[1:24:44] there it is see
[1:24:45] perfectly just in harmony
[1:24:49] and he says he says o people without him
[1:24:52] getting quick
[1:24:53] it might be the last opportunity you'll
[1:24:56] ever be able to have you don't know what
[1:24:58] time
[1:24:59] he might come so prior
[1:25:03] to this friday the holy spirit had
[1:25:07] not revealed this to brother branham and
[1:25:08] then he preaches the feast of the
[1:25:10] trumpets
[1:25:11] brother manum says you people say what
[1:25:13] about the early saints this is questions
[1:25:14] and answers
[1:25:15] what was that he says that was the now
[1:25:17] people people say
[1:25:18] the people say what about the early
[1:25:20] saints the martyrs
[1:25:22] he says that was the changing of the
[1:25:23] dispensations that was
[1:25:25] under persecution which if you was here
[1:25:27] to hear this church ages and to see how
[1:25:29] they went into outer darkness and how to
[1:25:30] do that then that shows where they had
[1:25:32] to take that persecution
[1:25:33] because each one of the church ages that
[1:25:35] everything begins to show that they were
[1:25:37] darker and darker
[1:25:38] until they finally went to a complete
[1:25:40] place that they denied his name
[1:25:42] picked up another name that they lived
[1:25:44] and were dead
[1:25:46] sardis and then it come on out thyatira
[1:25:49] sardis then coming out
[1:25:50] he says then come out then it began to
[1:25:52] come out to philadelphia so forth
[1:25:53] then come to the time of the calling out
[1:25:55] of the bride which was to escape
[1:25:57] which was to escape all
[1:26:00] damnation now you see this change
[1:26:04] in the what brother brandon begins to
[1:26:05] say listen he says i don't have it on my
[1:26:07] screen i'm just going to keep reading it
[1:26:08] here so
[1:26:09] he he changes this from the friday night
[1:26:12] brother brandon preaches the feast of
[1:26:14] the holy spirit comes
[1:26:16] the angel of the lord comes and speaks
[1:26:17] to brother branham and the holy spirit
[1:26:19] begins to completely
[1:26:21] change and correct everything that he
[1:26:24] had previously
[1:26:25] thought so much so that he says you see
[1:26:28] why the lord wouldn't even allow me to
[1:26:31] preach it
[1:26:32] why it did not apply to him
[1:26:35] it did not apply to us
[1:26:38] and he says notice this here let me just
[1:26:41] find my
[1:26:42] find my place here and feast of the
[1:26:43] trumpets let me give me just one moment
[1:26:45] because i didn't
[1:26:46] realize now i didn't get it here uh on
[1:26:48] the screen so
[1:26:49] i want to make sure we get it here
[1:26:54] yes this is this is this is it here
[1:26:57] brother branham says this he says
[1:26:59] now how would a how would a before we
[1:27:02] come to that let me just read this to
[1:27:03] you
[1:27:04] uh quickly in isaiah 24 we're going to
[1:27:06] pause that just for a moment
[1:27:08] you can you can take that down brother
[1:27:09] matthew and then you could follow me on
[1:27:11] the scriptures
[1:27:12] so isaiah chapter 24 just come with me
[1:27:14] there uh
[1:27:15] quickly we're almost out of time
[1:27:19] and isaiah 24 verse 1 pro
[1:27:22] prophecy here this is we're going to
[1:27:24] read through 24 and then sum of 25.
[1:27:28] isaiah begins to warn of this
[1:27:32] and this is just one of the this is just
[1:27:34] one of
[1:27:35] one of many scriptures we could have
[1:27:36] chosen many you can display that
[1:27:39] isaiah 24 1 this is one of many that we
[1:27:42] could have chose that refers to
[1:27:44] the end time or the coming or the the
[1:27:46] jacob's trouble or the end of the world
[1:27:48] as we would call it
[1:27:50] but he begins to warn of this and says
[1:27:53] behold
[1:27:54] the lord maketh the earth empty
[1:27:58] and maketh it waste and turneth
[1:28:01] it upside down and scattereth abroad
[1:28:06] the inhabitants thereof listen to that
[1:28:08] listen to this prophecy now this is
[1:28:10] do this is doom and gloom but this is
[1:28:13] this is a time when
[1:28:14] i'm not here and you're not here we just
[1:28:17] read that
[1:28:21] we just read that he says
[1:28:25] behold the lord maketh the earth
[1:28:29] empty and maketh it waste
[1:28:33] and turneth it upside down boy they
[1:28:36] think the world is turned upside down
[1:28:38] now
[1:28:40] they think the world is turned upside
[1:28:42] down now they have no
[1:28:43] idea when the lord turns the world
[1:28:46] upside down
[1:28:49] the bible says there will be weeping and
[1:28:50] welling and gnashing of teeth
[1:28:52] crying out for the rocks to fall upon
[1:28:54] them seeking death but they won't find
[1:28:57] it
[1:28:58] scattereth abroad the inhabitants of the
[1:29:00] world so what is this this is a this is
[1:29:03] a prophecy of judgment as we as we've
[1:29:06] said
[1:29:06] brother madam says so many times before
[1:29:08] there's nothing left
[1:29:10] for this nation but judgment because why
[1:29:13] they rejected mercy just as israel
[1:29:15] rejected mercy when they rejected amos
[1:29:18] when they rejected jeremiah
[1:29:20] when they rejected the voices of god
[1:29:21] that god sent to them to repent and they
[1:29:24] refuse to repent and what did god do
[1:29:27] before
[1:29:28] israel all right let me just catch this
[1:29:30] here for a moment
[1:29:31] but before when amos finally comes and
[1:29:33] amos is the second to last prophet
[1:29:36] that israel is going to get he's the
[1:29:38] second
[1:29:39] last second to last chance of mercy that
[1:29:42] god sends
[1:29:43] then he sends hosea and then they vanish
[1:29:47] but he sends prophet after major after
[1:29:49] minor minor minor prophet uh
[1:29:52] coming to israel crying out to them as
[1:29:54] we said it was god's message to them
[1:29:56] and after they refused to repent and
[1:29:58] refuse to turn around
[1:29:59] israel wasn't just the northern tribes
[1:30:02] it was also benjamin and judah as well
[1:30:05] and they had completely turned to
[1:30:07] idolatry
[1:30:08] and amos comes with a hard message and
[1:30:10] he's trying to get their attention
[1:30:12] and they rejected amos they rejected his
[1:30:14] word as if he never even spoke
[1:30:17] amen so god gives one more chance and he
[1:30:20] gives
[1:30:20] he sends a tender hearted man a kind man
[1:30:23] named hosea
[1:30:24] wasn't to say that amos wasn't kind but
[1:30:26] his word his words were harsh
[1:30:29] and so he sins you know the bible says
[1:30:31] the word of god is
[1:30:33] is like a two-edged sword and he says
[1:30:36] that divideth asunder both
[1:30:37] bone and marrow and spirit and so the
[1:30:40] word of god when god comes and he and he
[1:30:42] speaks
[1:30:43] he can come and he can come like amos
[1:30:45] who who speaks and tells you this is
[1:30:47] what god's thinking
[1:30:48] this is what god's word says this is
[1:30:50] god's judgment then he sends a man named
[1:30:52] hosea
[1:30:52] who's a tenderhearted man a kind man who
[1:30:55] spoke softly who spoke appealing not
[1:30:57] accusing
[1:30:59] is it a different message no amos's
[1:31:02] message could be summed up
[1:31:03] in these words return to me you read
[1:31:05] that over and over and over in amos
[1:31:07] i sent the mildew and i sent the the
[1:31:10] corruption and i
[1:31:10] and i took away your your crops and i
[1:31:13] caused diseases
[1:31:14] and he says yet you didn't return to me
[1:31:18] and so god said what does god do god
[1:31:20] sends them god sends pestilence
[1:31:22] and he and he says in amos 4 you go and
[1:31:25] read it and he
[1:31:26] and he talks about uh he says i i caused
[1:31:29] your water to dry up
[1:31:32] and you know no doubt the israelites
[1:31:34] thought for sure that was an attack from
[1:31:35] the enemy from the devil
[1:31:38] literally they know it was god it was
[1:31:41] jehovah
[1:31:43] and he says so he says i took your water
[1:31:45] and he says i took away all your fresh
[1:31:46] water
[1:31:47] and he says yet you did not return to me
[1:31:49] saith the lord
[1:31:50] and he said so i sent the mildew and i
[1:31:53] sent the
[1:31:54] uh the frost and i forget the other word
[1:31:56] he uses there
[1:31:57] and he says and he said he says i sent
[1:31:59] the tornado
[1:32:00] i sent the cyclone i said the lightning
[1:32:02] i burn up your cattle i caused your
[1:32:05] crops to fail
[1:32:07] three months before harvest i stopped
[1:32:09] the rain that's what he says in amos for
[1:32:11] i cut the rain off
[1:32:15] and god says yet you did not return to
[1:32:17] me
[1:32:18] so i sent disease and he says
[1:32:22] to your crops and they died and your
[1:32:24] your entire harvest was
[1:32:26] was finished yet you did not return to
[1:32:28] me they just went on and on and on and
[1:32:30] on
[1:32:30] so he says so then i sent diseases
[1:32:32] amongst your people
[1:32:34] and people died yet you did not return
[1:32:36] to me
[1:32:37] and then he says and then i sent raiders
[1:32:41] enemies who they had not before i sent
[1:32:44] raiders and they came in and plundered
[1:32:46] you
[1:32:48] yeah you did not return to me saith the
[1:32:51] lord
[1:32:53] and so then he sends an earthquake
[1:32:56] remember amos 1
[1:32:58] amos 1 1 go read the the very end of
[1:33:00] amos 1 1 it says
[1:33:02] the word of the lord which came from god
[1:33:04] to amos this is written
[1:33:05] after the fact amos is written in
[1:33:07] retrospect
[1:33:08] it's not as it happens it's retrospect
[1:33:11] in other words
[1:33:12] the writing is happening after all
[1:33:14] everything's already taken place it's a
[1:33:16] record of what happened
[1:33:17] and when you read amos 1 1 it says the
[1:33:20] words of the lord that god sent to amos
[1:33:23] two years before the earthquake
[1:33:28] two years before the earthquake two
[1:33:31] years
[1:33:31] in other words in retrospect you're
[1:33:33] going to read them i'm writing all this
[1:33:34] down now what i'm about
[1:33:36] to write that amos said to them this was
[1:33:38] 24 months
[1:33:40] before destruction now they
[1:33:44] didn't know that when amos opened his
[1:33:47] mouth on sunday for the first sermon he
[1:33:49] preached to them
[1:33:50] god started the timer 24 months and
[1:33:53] counting
[1:33:56] and then an earthquake will come and
[1:33:57] wipe out this place
[1:34:00] did you know that zachariah 205
[1:34:04] years later talks about that earthquake
[1:34:07] it was so
[1:34:07] devastating but it's interesting because
[1:34:10] he writes that it says two years before
[1:34:12] the earthquake in other words
[1:34:13] they didn't know anyone living at that
[1:34:15] time had no idea
[1:34:17] had no idea when he was just preaching
[1:34:18] all i'm sure they went to church with
[1:34:20] all here he goes again
[1:34:22] talking about how we dress talking about
[1:34:24] our sisters talking about where we how
[1:34:26] we live in our entertainments and
[1:34:27] here he goes preaching again can't we
[1:34:29] just hear about the love of god and my
[1:34:31] goodness we already got coronavirus
[1:34:33] brother
[1:34:34] i mean my goodness can't you give us
[1:34:36] something joyful
[1:34:39] it's christmas
[1:34:44] i'm sure they would have said any
[1:34:45] anything against because isaiah amos's
[1:34:48] only message was just
[1:34:49] doom and gloom god's coming and it says
[1:34:52] this is the words the lord spoke through
[1:34:54] through hosea
[1:34:55] two years before the earthquake and then
[1:34:57] 24 months later
[1:34:59] earthquake comes he sends cat what does
[1:35:01] god say he says i sent the mildew i sent
[1:35:03] the
[1:35:03] frost to i killed your plants so you
[1:35:05] didn't return then i sent disease then i
[1:35:07] said reader still you didn't return then
[1:35:08] i said an earthquake
[1:35:11] i thought about that and thought my
[1:35:12] goodness we don't know
[1:35:14] that we can look back on the other side
[1:35:16] in retrospect
[1:35:17] and say little did we know in march of
[1:35:19] 2020
[1:35:20] uh when the covet first broke out that
[1:35:22] was only 24 months before the rapture
[1:35:25] took place
[1:35:27] in retrospect we can say that was only
[1:35:29] two years before
[1:35:31] california the earthquake sunk
[1:35:33] california and it went to the bottom of
[1:35:35] the ocean just 24 months brothers before
[1:35:37] that
[1:35:41] just 24 months could you imagine two
[1:35:44] years
[1:35:45] before the earthquake and god says yet
[1:35:47] you didn't return to me what is this
[1:35:48] nation done
[1:35:49] what is it what did just look at the
[1:35:51] world today what do you think a
[1:35:53] hurricane is brother madam in the
[1:35:54] oncoming storm says it's the
[1:35:56] judgments of god trying to trying to
[1:35:59] what was it it was judgment but it was
[1:36:00] mercy
[1:36:02] because god sends destruction to get our
[1:36:04] attention to have us turn our hearts
[1:36:06] back to him
[1:36:09] no punishment ever got that god ever
[1:36:10] gives to a believer is to hurt them or
[1:36:12] damage them it's always to correct them
[1:36:15] always to turn them around
[1:36:21] and so god says but you didn't return to
[1:36:23] me you didn't return to me i spoke you
[1:36:25] didn't return to me
[1:36:26] and he says then i said an earthquake
[1:36:28] but you say oh that was horrible
[1:36:29] it was terrible but that wasn't the
[1:36:31] worst of it you know what the worst
[1:36:32] part was is that god took them out of
[1:36:35] their promised land and sentiment to
[1:36:37] babylon
[1:36:39] and he took what was theirs what would
[1:36:41] always had always been theirs and god
[1:36:43] removed them from the promised land
[1:36:46] but you say brother matt was there
[1:36:47] something worse than that yeah there was
[1:36:48] something worse
[1:36:50] what was worse than the earthquake what
[1:36:52] was worse than the crop failure what was
[1:36:54] worse than the disease
[1:36:55] you know what was worse is that in spite
[1:36:58] of
[1:36:58] all of amos's and hosea's preaching
[1:37:01] nobody
[1:37:02] cared
[1:37:05] nobody didn't care
[1:37:09] didn't care just completely apathetic to
[1:37:13] everything just
[1:37:14] oh well no care no concern at all
[1:37:18] thought about this when you read when
[1:37:20] you we are at isaiah 24 the lord maketh
[1:37:22] the earth empty make it that ways turn
[1:37:24] us upside down
[1:37:24] in other words this is prophetic what
[1:37:27] god's going to do
[1:37:28] and so what's what is god sin he sent
[1:37:30] judgment
[1:37:31] what is what what do you think hurricane
[1:37:33] katrina was what do you think the
[1:37:34] tsunami that hit japan was
[1:37:36] what do you think all of the pandemics
[1:37:38] that we've had besides the coronavirus
[1:37:40] and now the coronavirus is
[1:37:43] it's a sign of judgment to a nation
[1:37:45] that's turned their back on god
[1:37:48] i sent the mildew i sent the as i killed
[1:37:50] your cops i sent just i sent judgment
[1:37:52] yet you didn't return unto me
[1:37:55] and so he says god would suddenly wipe
[1:37:58] it out
[1:37:59] john says that in revelations 18
[1:38:01] revelations 18 verse 8 pull that up
[1:38:03] quickly
[1:38:04] we're just going to read that and then
[1:38:05] we'll we'll we'll uh we're going to
[1:38:07] close
[1:38:07] not too much longer here john says here
[1:38:11] and he says in one day john revelation
[1:38:13] 18 8 one day death and morning in famine
[1:38:16] and she shall be utterly burned
[1:38:19] therefore shall her plagues come in one
[1:38:21] day death and mourning
[1:38:23] imagine that in one day
[1:38:28] i think you know it's been things are
[1:38:30] being over the past few years but god
[1:38:32] says
[1:38:32] therefore shall her plagues come in one
[1:38:34] day death and mourning and famine
[1:38:37] and she shall be utterly burned with
[1:38:38] fire for strong as the lord god who
[1:38:41] judgeth her
[1:38:44] 17 for in
[1:38:47] one hour one hour
[1:38:51] now we went from one day to one hour now
[1:38:53] we know who this is referring to but i
[1:38:54] want you to notice this prophecy
[1:38:56] he says for in one hour
[1:38:59] so great riches has come to naught
[1:39:03] and every shipmaster and all the company
[1:39:05] and ships
[1:39:06] and sailors and as many as trade by the
[1:39:08] sea stood afar off verse 18 keep going
[1:39:11] stood afar off and cried when they saw
[1:39:14] the smoke of her burning saying what
[1:39:16] city is like unto this great city keep
[1:39:18] going just keep going verse 19.
[1:39:19] and they cast dust on their heads and
[1:39:21] cried we've been well in santa last alas
[1:39:23] that great city
[1:39:24] where and we're made rich all that had
[1:39:26] ships in the sea by reason of her
[1:39:27] costliness for in one
[1:39:29] hour she is made desolate
[1:39:33] just like that in one hour
[1:39:38] she has made desolate
[1:39:41] back to isaiah 24 in verse 10 notice
[1:39:44] what he begins to speak here and he says
[1:39:46] the city of no in isaiah 24 verse 10
[1:39:50] brother matthew
[1:39:52] i want to make sure we catch this i want
[1:39:54] to read it together the city of
[1:39:55] confusion
[1:39:56] so there's confusion it's it's it's it's
[1:39:58] you imagine
[1:39:59] i can imagine it's going to be grey
[1:40:01] confusion
[1:40:03] the day of the lord is like no other day
[1:40:05] the bible says that it's like no other
[1:40:07] day
[1:40:07] that has ever been no nor
[1:40:10] never will be great confusion
[1:40:15] is broken down every house is shut up
[1:40:17] know that no man
[1:40:18] may come in verse 12 in the city
[1:40:22] is left desolation and the gate is
[1:40:24] smitten
[1:40:25] with destruction verse back
[1:40:28] go back to verse 6. brother matthew i
[1:40:31] missed it
[1:40:32] verse 6 therefore hath the curse devour
[1:40:35] the earth and they that dwell there and
[1:40:36] are desolate therefore the inhabitants
[1:40:38] of the earth are burned
[1:40:39] and few men left it's amazing because
[1:40:42] when you look at this
[1:40:44] isaiah speaks of this here and i want to
[1:40:46] i don't i want to condense some of this
[1:40:48] so that
[1:40:49] we don't hold you too long here but it's
[1:40:53] amazing because
[1:40:54] he speaks and he says all everything is
[1:40:57] going to change
[1:40:58] we titled this message here tonight a
[1:41:00] sudden change and i thought about
[1:41:03] we we've we've thought coveted 19 was
[1:41:06] such a
[1:41:07] change but they have no idea what a
[1:41:09] sudden change is coming to the world
[1:41:12] the bible says for when they say peace
[1:41:15] and safety
[1:41:16] then cometh sudden destruction you ever
[1:41:20] notice that it says that not gradual not
[1:41:22] drawn out over two or three years
[1:41:26] but he says when they say peace and
[1:41:27] safety then sudden
[1:41:31] sudden amen sudden destruction
[1:41:34] just just like that rapid
[1:41:38] overnight and one day in fact in one
[1:41:41] hour
[1:41:44] suddenly the whole world isaiah says
[1:41:48] in verse 6 that we're reading here says
[1:41:51] therefore
[1:41:52] uh isaiah 2 26 brother matthew i'm sorry
[1:41:55] isaiah chapter 26 verse 5
[1:41:59] next chapter verse 5
[1:42:05] for he bringeth down them that dwell on
[1:42:08] high
[1:42:09] the lofty city he layeth it low he
[1:42:11] layeth it low
[1:42:13] even to the ground he bringeth it
[1:42:16] even to the dust
[1:42:20] we read in 24 the inhabitants of the
[1:42:22] earth are burned up he layeth it low he
[1:42:24] layeth it low
[1:42:26] it bringeth down them that dwell on high
[1:42:29] them that thought they were so great
[1:42:31] them that that had
[1:42:33] had thought that fame was everything god
[1:42:36] said he
[1:42:38] makes them low you imagine the chaos in
[1:42:41] the planet in the world
[1:42:43] the chaotic moment all
[1:42:46] everything that they know is life will
[1:42:49] suddenly
[1:42:50] cease to exist they think this is i keep
[1:42:54] referring to this because i think as
[1:42:56] we've said
[1:42:57] before the brother who wrote the little
[1:42:59] poem about coven this is just a dress
[1:43:01] rehearsal
[1:43:02] yeah and i've just been thinking of that
[1:43:05] this is just a preparation of what's
[1:43:07] coming they have no idea
[1:43:10] just a precursor they think they think
[1:43:12] that what life is they've known it oh
[1:43:14] what's
[1:43:14] when are we going back to normal
[1:43:18] when can we get back to normal well what
[1:43:20] what's normal
[1:43:22] that's what i want to ask what was
[1:43:24] normal i know to us what it means to you
[1:43:26] could be you could you could give
[1:43:27] reasons and say that was my normal
[1:43:29] that'd be perfectly appropriate but you
[1:43:30] know
[1:43:31] to some people what was normal was a
[1:43:33] life just
[1:43:34] laden with sins can we get back to
[1:43:37] normal normal potter
[1:43:39] party and partying normal clubbing
[1:43:41] normal running around normal
[1:43:43] just normal life they just want to go
[1:43:44] back to the back to the good old days
[1:43:50] back to when things were normal oh they
[1:43:52] have no idea
[1:43:54] the disorder and the disarray and the
[1:43:55] dislocation and just the utter
[1:43:58] sudden change that'll come upon
[1:44:02] the world no army can save them no
[1:44:05] government no
[1:44:06] president no biden no trumps
[1:44:10] no republicans no democrats
[1:44:15] no world system no money no amount of
[1:44:17] money all the money in the world won't
[1:44:19] save them
[1:44:21] no experts
[1:44:24] no experts they put together a team here
[1:44:27] for covet
[1:44:28] it's the covid task force good team
[1:44:31] a lot of doctors a lot of scientists a
[1:44:33] lot of good educated people
[1:44:34] and they you see them assembled before
[1:44:36] press conferences and there's five or
[1:44:38] six of them they got the expert
[1:44:40] in disease and then the expert in
[1:44:41] medicine then the the the expert over
[1:44:43] here
[1:44:44] and and they got all of these experts in
[1:44:46] this team
[1:44:47] well guess what they they won't have a
[1:44:50] task force
[1:44:51] they won't have a team that they can put
[1:44:53] together to bring a solution to this
[1:44:55] problem

[1:48:45] as with the people so with the priest
[1:48:48] that's with the servant so with his
[1:48:50] master
[1:48:51] as with the maid so with her mistress as
[1:48:54] with the buyer so with the seller as
[1:48:57] with the lender
[1:48:58] so with the borrower as with the taker
[1:49:01] of usury
[1:49:03] sow with the giver of usury

[1:49:49] there won't be any more sports
[1:49:52] and in fact sports will be the last
[1:49:54] thing on anybody's mind
[1:49:56] amen there won't be a super bowl
[1:50:01] that'd be the furthest thing that you
[1:50:02] would ever think of
[1:50:04] anybody would ever think of there will
[1:50:07] be no more
[1:50:08] 250 million dollar contracts
[1:50:12] for athletes they'll be gone
[1:50:15] the whole world will be in chaos not
[1:50:18] just america
[1:50:19] nationwide the whole world will be in
[1:50:21] calamity
[1:50:23] the whole world will be suffering every
[1:50:26] man-made
[1:50:26] idol will come crashing down
[1:50:31] there will be no superstar you can look
[1:50:33] to there won't be no
[1:50:34] bill gates you can look to there won't
[1:50:36] be any millionaires that you can look to
[1:50:39] because everybody will be in the same
[1:50:41] boat
[1:50:43] everything will come as the bible says
[1:50:45] to dust
[1:50:48] the rich will become the poor alike
[1:50:51] everybody will be in the same condition
[1:50:53] suffering the same exact thing no one
[1:50:55] will have an advantage
[1:50:58] first thessalonians 5 3 it will happen
[1:51:00] when they say
[1:51:01] first thessalonians 5 verse 3.
[1:51:06] when they shall say peace and safety
[1:51:09] first thessalonians 5 3 then
[1:51:12] then sudden destruction
[1:51:16] upon them as travail
[1:51:19] upon a woman with child and they shall
[1:51:22] not escape i take no joy in
[1:51:26] thinking or reading that to think of all
[1:51:29] of the seeds of humanity and all of the
[1:51:32] well-meaning and people who were
[1:51:33] dreaming and people who were
[1:51:35] who were living we take no
[1:51:38] joy in thinking of the destruction of
[1:51:40] the wicked
[1:51:42] that's why that's why we preach mercy
[1:51:45] now
[1:51:46] that's why we preach grace now that's
[1:51:49] why we
[1:51:49] speak to our to to our to uh to to the
[1:51:52] people that we have in our life say
[1:51:54] unsaved
[1:51:56] whether it's family or friends or work
[1:51:58] associates that's why we tell the world
[1:52:00] about jesus
[1:52:02] that's why we have a heart for for for
[1:52:04] the lost
[1:52:05] because we see what's coming and what
[1:52:07] they could be saved out of
[1:52:10] that is that is why a preacher gets up
[1:52:12] and preaches
[1:52:13] a message about your life and about how
[1:52:16] you live and how you better get the holy
[1:52:17] ghost and how you better get more
[1:52:19] sincere
[1:52:20] and be more dedicated because there's
[1:52:21] love bubbling out of our heart
[1:52:23] that we don't want anybody in this
[1:52:25] church to miss it we don't want
[1:52:27] anybody in this church to be here during
[1:52:29] this moment we want
[1:52:30] everybody to go
[1:52:31] [Applause]
[1:52:33] that's why we preach the things that we
[1:52:35] preach
[1:52:38] then sudden destruction then
[1:52:42] suddenly just suddenly
[1:52:45] everything changes suddenly
[1:52:49] everything stops
[1:52:53] suddenly the whole world
[1:52:56] is shaking suddenly all government
[1:53:00] systems
[1:53:01] all presidents all leaders all powers
[1:53:05] all ideas but the bible says in first
[1:53:09] corinthians chapter 52
[1:53:12] i want you to turn there if you could
[1:53:15] first corinthians chapter
[1:53:17] 15 verse 52
[1:53:21] the bible says suddenly the world will
[1:53:24] change
[1:53:25] they say peace and safety then sudden
[1:53:27] destruction cometh upon them
[1:53:29] but here's what the bible says in first
[1:53:31] corinthians chapter 15
[1:53:33] to actually start with verse 50 brother
[1:53:35] matthew just a couple verses before that
[1:53:37] now this i say brethren that flesh and
[1:53:39] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god
[1:53:41] neither does corruption inherit
[1:53:43] incorruption
[1:53:44] behold i show you a mystery in other
[1:53:47] words what is that
[1:53:48] word there for mystery something
[1:53:50] previously
[1:53:51] hidden now revealed he says behold i
[1:53:55] show you a mystery we shall not all
[1:53:58] sleep in other words not all of us are
[1:54:01] going to die not all of us are going to
[1:54:02] go to death but we
[1:54:03] shall all be changed
[1:54:07] notice this next verse for in a moment
[1:54:12] imagine just like that
[1:54:16] in a moment you've been serving the lord
[1:54:18] for how many years you can all say here
[1:54:20] today i got saved on this day and this
[1:54:22] year and
[1:54:23] i've been serving the lord this many
[1:54:24] years been coming to church this many
[1:54:25] years
[1:54:27] but you know what the bible says in a
[1:54:29] moment
[1:54:30] just like that in a moment
[1:54:34] in the twinkling of an eye i don't know
[1:54:37] what that means i've looked it up and
[1:54:39] and bible commentators believe it's like
[1:54:41] how fast the light
[1:54:42] takes to go and hit the iris in other
[1:54:45] words when you flip your light switch on

[1:56:31] don't feel good
[1:56:33] but after that change there won't be no
[1:56:35] more of that it'll all just be
[1:56:37] one glorious experience it'll be one
[1:56:40] a moment of praise and worship and
