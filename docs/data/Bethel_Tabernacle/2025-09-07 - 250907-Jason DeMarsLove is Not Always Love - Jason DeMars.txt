And life is worth the living just because he lives. And because he lives, I can face tomorrow because he lives.

Oh, because he lives. I give to my heart. Glory. glory because he lives. Amen. All fear is gone [Applause] because I know and I know he holds my future. My life is worth the living because he lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. So thankful for that. He lives not not off someplace far away, but he he lives right here amongst his people. and not just amongst his people. He's living in his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the one that's made the change. He's the one that's working out his perfect will and character and life within us. I'm so thankful for that. Amen. It's not just a matter of what someone else has told me, but I'm a witness of his resurrection because his resurrection has taken place in me. Amen. So thankful for that and so thankful to be with you here this morning. And uh we're going to go directly to the word. Want to speak on the subject love is not always love. And um I think this is the fifth fifth time I've spoken this in uh two and a half weeks. My my family's heard that uh four times. This will be the fourth time. So, the Lord has something for us to learn, I believe, even when we hear the same message over and over again. And if you listen to me streaming somewhere before, praise the Lord. Keep pulling on the word and maybe you'll pull me in a direction that I never went thought I was going to go before. So, amen. First scripture I want to look at is in 1 John chapter 4 uh verse 16 and we we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him. May the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word. You can be seated. Amen. So God is love and then he that dwelleth in love is is dwelling in God and God is dwelling in him. So we see then the importance of love. But even even more and deeper than that is that we need to understand the what love actually is because not all things that we as humans as Americans as English speakers call love are actually love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so not all love is God. &gt;&gt; God is love. But not all love as we define it and as we speak about it is God. And this is the place that people are so confused in our modern culture uh especially in America amongst people and then it then it is sort of becomes different sayings that people have and then it becomes some people's religion based on those sayings and they they say things like um love is love and then well what do you mean by that? What are you talking about? Of course, it's got got nice rainbow uh colors on the statement that love is love. And they've taken and stolen the sign of God's covenant to place it onto something that's so uh wicked and perverted as the homosexual movement. And love is not always love. Many times what people call love is actually evil and is actually hateful and is actually damaging to people's lives. And there's a great danger in that. And so when we think of that, think of love, we really have to think about as Christians in this hour when somebody says, "Oh, they're using actually as a weapon to control you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? That the word love has been weaponized to control whether or not you speak the truth. &gt;&gt; To control whether or not you confront over sin. Here's another great saying that we have that ties into it. Judge not. Don't judge me &gt;&gt; now. Don't judge me. Okay, we're judging you. You just you just gave us uh uh our antennas now that we must judge what this person is saying. The spiritual man judges all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. And not only that, but finish the statement of what Jesus says, the entire paragraph of what he's speaking about about judge not. He says because with what measure that you meet, the same will be measured back to you. So if we're measuring it by the word, which is what we all should be, not our own judgment, not our own thoughts, not our own ideas, but measuring it by the word, then we have some good judgment happening. And that's what that's what we're required to do. And so if I if I can put forward what I'm going to speak about at the end just to give you a give you a picture as we're going into it is love is not love unless it's ordered properly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love is not love unless there's correct boundaries &gt;&gt; and and a correct understanding of the orders. And we'll talk about that more. I don't want to get so far ahead of myself. But so God is love. But do you know that's not the only thing that God is. &gt;&gt; So God is love. It's not that God has love or God becomes love or God God loves. God is love. That's that's who he is. That's his character. That's his nature. That's his identity. So if unless we're defining love based upon what God is, then we're actually missing the entire picture. Secondly, John also tells us that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. &gt;&gt; And then third, the Lord Jesus tells us that God is spirit. I know we have in our King James it says God is a spirit, but it literally is God is spirit. That's what God is. And so if we can understand the the the nature and the characteristics and the attributes of God, all of those characteristics and that attributes flow out of God being love and light and spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so being that he's light, it can't there can't be any shades of of darkness in him. So God's love is not accepting darkness, right? It's light that's penetrating. It's light that's holy. It's light and love together that's good. And so in order for God to be good, if God has a standard a standard and someone comes against that standard, then God must move against the person who's coming against his standard. He un unless we understand God who God is in the fullness of his nature. If we have an approach to God where we where we hear people say, you know, I just couldn't see Jesus saying that to a person after after saying some convicting words, something that's direct and to the point. I couldn't see Jesus saying that. You can tell that somebody's never read the Bible when they say things like that because there's about 10 to 15 circumstances of Jesus directly calling people names &gt;&gt; and mocking them &gt;&gt; and even the prophets themselves mocking evil and mocking the devil. &gt;&gt; And so by our terms and standards, not very nice, right? not not very loving. Don't Jesus would never say anything like that to sinners. He said, "Unless you you think the people there that the Tower of Saleom fell on were such wicked sinners more than everybody else, but I tell you, unless you repent, &gt;&gt; you will all likewise perish." In other words, he's telling you the tower should fall on you also. Don't think, don't think because the tower fell on them that you don't deserve the same, that you're somehow better than them. No, absolutely not. You deserve exactly the same. You deserve God's just wrath and punishment. And un unless we understand that very basic point, then we've never even we never even heard the gospel. We never have understood the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. We could never have a true understanding of repentance unless we understand our own sinfulness and our own sinful nature and our own need to submit our thoughts and our lives completely to him. &gt;&gt; It's not just a matter of God is love and he just okays everything that we do. You don't even know God. &gt;&gt; Exodus 34 verse 6. I love this because Moses asks the Lord, I want to see your glory. And this is a place where he takes Moses and he puts him in the cliff of the rock and Moses just sees the back parts of the Lord. Right? And I find it so astounding because it was it's not as though the Lord came and said, "Just see my uh manifestation. That's enough to see my glory." It's actually not enough. Many people were in brother Brandham's meetings and saw the pillar of fire and they got healed and they never got saved &gt;&gt; and they're in hell today because they never repented and gave their lives to the Lord. There's people that I mean they all perished in the wilderness. We hear that and our fathers did eat mana in the wilderness and Jesus says they're everyone dead. Guess what? They saw the pillar of fire come down and light up a whole mountain and the voice of the words speaking to them and it still &gt;&gt; wasn't enough because they didn't even that in that in that case we could say they saw his glory. It's got to go beyond just that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord passed by before him and proclaimed. So there has to be a proclamation. There has to be a voice go along with the presence. If there's not a voice that goes along with the presence, the presence will not do you any good. There has to be a word that goes forth. And then it has to go further than that because the people heard the words and they all perished in the wilderness. It has to go to spiritual revelation to your heart. The proclamation has to go from out there to in here. &gt;&gt; And so he comes forth. I want to see the glory of the Lord. The Lord passes by and what he what does he do? That's it. No, he proclaims. So the Lord himself is going to proclaim Yahweh Jehovah, Yahweh Elohim, the Lord God. And then he then he goes off and he begins to give us a list of attributes so that we would understand who he is. Merciful and gracious, long-suffering, patient, patient, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin. Amen. We want it to stop there. But if we stop there, then we don't even know who God is. and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children unto the third and to the fourth generation. So, in order to really understand God's love, we also have to understand he's a God of of wrath. He's a God of judgment. And so, right here when he gives his he starts out with those things which which we view and look at as the things we're in great need of, right? We're all in need of those things. And yet the other part, without the other part, the first part doesn't make any sense without understanding that God does not clear the guilty. How is it possible? He says he forgives iniquity and transgression in sin. And then in the next voice, next in the same sentence, he says, "I don't clear the guilty and I visit your sins upon the uh your children and to your grandchildren and to your great-grandchildren." My goodness. So, how does that work? &gt;&gt; God always has a means to to break the chains. God always has a means to stop the sin from passing to generation to generation. God always has a means to clear the guilty. But he won't just automatically do it. You have to come his way. You have to approach him. It has to come in repentance and faith and and uh getting immersed in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and being filled with the Holy Ghost. And so there you have to come his way for your guilt to be cleared. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so there's there's there is a a clear delineation that God is making when he's putting in this. God himself has boundaries to his love. You say his love is eternal. It's it's it goes on forever. It never changes. Absolutely correct. &gt;&gt; And yet he also has boundaries. And he says, "If you do this, then this is going to come." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. and and the great deception that the children of Israel had and that the pe the prophets in the days of uh Isaiah and Jeremiah and Ezekiel, all of them said, "No, no, God's not going to send us out of the land." It says right in the word, "If you don't obey the scriptures, I will send you forth out of the land." And here you have the prophets, thus sayeth the Lord, you shall not be driven out of the land. God God sees and knows everything that's going on and he will deliver us out of their hands. And the and the true prophets are saying, "Thus sayith the Lord, you're gone. You're finished." And what's God calling to them to repent? So what's the devil calling them to do? Don't repent. You're fine just like you are. Just stay this way. And God is saying there's a there's a pathway just as he says through Jeremiah. If at any time that I prophesy and I speak forth and say that this nation will be plucked up, if they listen and hear that and repent, then I will repent of the word that I spoke to them. &gt;&gt; Right through the prophet, he explains that to them and the people and the people of Israel just say there's no need for repentance. We're the chosen people. What an attitude. Many, many times in the message, we have the same attitude. We are the message believers. We're the greatest believers of all time. &gt;&gt; There's no one been ever been like us before. &gt;&gt; Unless you repent, you'll also perish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As brother Brad was speaking about humility this morning, we that's that's what we need. That's what God's looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, I better keep going. I'll never get anywhere. Again, we have to see the balance in who God is. If we don't rightly see the balance in who God is, we'll never understand what love is. And ultimately, we'll never know God himself. In adoption number four, brother Brandham says, "I said, 'Oh Lord, that's what I'm here at the church for, trying to set the church in order, telling you, brother and sister, there's only one thing can enter that. That's perfect love. Not because you're loyal loyal to Brandham Tabernacle or the Methodist Church or Baptist Church. Them's all right. Or we could say the message churches. &gt;&gt; Them's all right. You should be. But oh friends, you've got not because you spoke with tongues, danced in the spirit, because you cast out devils, or moved mountains with faith. That's all right. For that's all right. But still, unless that real perfect love is in there, that was where perfect love was. He's talking about the the the uh beyond the curtain of time. That's where perfect love was. And that's the only thing that'll let you in there. That's the only thing that can stay there. It's the only thing that there was there. Oh my. It's an adoption. God before the foundation of the world. And how &gt;&gt; critical that is perfect love. And again, we can we can say this church preaches love and we can mean something completely different &gt;&gt; than the scripture. or this church is loving and we can mean something entirely different than what the word says. And that's that's the great danger that is posed by the work of the enemy is that people think that they know what love is without searching it by the scriptures and seeing what it actually and truly is. I love this next uh series of verses. John 21 verse 15. It's amazing. the Peter. This is this is the circumstance that Christ has been raised from the dead. They're out fishing and Jesus comes to them and Peter throws on his fisherman's coat, jumps in the water, swims there and all all of them come in and there's waiting fish sandwich cooking over the coals that Jesus had spoken into existence. And there he is. And this after this happens, he has a conversation with Peter. And again, this is the man that had great words that he would never deny the Lord Jesus, that he would go to the very ends with him, that he would surrender himself completely, and that he he he would die with him if it had to be. Right? And then as the Lord Jesus said, "Satan has desired to sift you as wheat, but I've prayed for you that your faith would fail you not." Amen. And so Peter goes and right in front of the Lord Jesus denies him the third time. And and what epic failure after amazing words were spoken, great commitments were made by mouth. And yet the life didn't line up with it. What he did didn't line up with the commitment that he felt that he made. And so now we have a different Peter. We don't have the same blustery Peter, loudmouth Peter. We have a Peter that's been thoroughly humbled. &gt;&gt; And look at and Jesus is humbling him further and pointing it out. So when they had dying, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas lovest or the word agape. Agape thou me more than these. So we'll get into definitions later, but just think of it as brother Bandham said, divine love. Agape is divine lovestape thou me more than these? He saith unto him, yay, Lord, thou knowest that I felio thee. So, Filelio, of course, is speaking of friendship or fondness. So, he's Lord, you you know that I'm fond of you. He saith unto him, "Feed my lambs." And and that that statement here by the Lord Jesus is re reaffirming Peter. Look at Peter. Does he deserve in his current condition for the Lord Jesus sake, go and be the pastor? I'm leaving. You're in charge. You preach to the people. This is this is this should shock and jar us. We know the history 2,000 years later. But put yourself in that moment. This is the man who was so weak that he he after all his promises, he denied the Lord Jesus. He refused to even say, "I know him." &gt;&gt; Let alone anything beyond that. And so here he is. He's speaking to Peter. Number one, he's revealing to Peter his own heart. And number two is he's saying,"I know all that. And yet I see something way beyond what you even know you're capable of. I'm seeing something. See a bigger picture. I'm seeing the place that I'm calling you to. Not just where you are in this moment. In this moment, no, you're in not any condition to this, but I see something bigger. I see something deeper. I see a a higher calling that I have for you. And it's in you to do it. My goodness. Talk about amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Verse 16, he saith to him again the second time, Simon son of Jonas, agape, thou me? He saith unto him, Yay, Lord, thou knowest that I feel ow thee. He saith unto him, feed my sheep. So again, we're we're repeating. I believe there's a there's a third one. I believe this is a a triple reinforcement to the triple denial. Amen. Because he he's he's saying to Peter, I know I know I see you. I see what I've made you to be. And I see that there's more for you to enter enter into. And I'm speaking the word over you that's going to carry. Because we we just look at this. Jesus knows he's omn omnisient. He knows everything and he just says what's going to happen. Don't you realize that God has put us in this same position &gt;&gt; for one another, for our children, &gt;&gt; for the believers that are around us? We can speak the word that carries them further than they ever really knew that they could go themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's this is agape love. Now Jesus is demonstrating what agape love is. And Peter is humbling himself saying,"I I I don't I know I don't have the strength to even claim divine love. I'm not claiming agape love." Yeah, I'm fond of you. I'm here, right? Feed my sheep. It's a shocking statement. He saith unto him the third time, Simon son of Jonest, feel thou me? Are you even fond of me, Peter? &gt;&gt; I mean, this is cutting right to the heart of Peter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Filelio, thou me. And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things. Thou knowest that I felio thee. Jesus saith unto him, feed my sheep. Verily, verily, I say unto thee, when thouast young, thou gest thyself, and walkest wither thou wouldest. When you're young, you did whatever you wanted to. You didn't s you didn't surrender yourself to the Lord. You just thought what you wanted to do and you went and you just did it. But when you're when you shall be old, I mean, think of it in the terms of you denied me three times. Put it against like that. You did what you wanted. You protected yourself. You saved yourself and denied me. You went wherever you wanted to. But when you're old, you'll stretch forth your hands, and another shall guard thee, and carry thee whether thou wouldest not. So what is being said here? You failed before &gt;&gt; by doing your own will. Here, you're going to surrender yourself completely and you won't fail and you'll go with me to the cross &gt;&gt; there when you're old. And so if we can really understand that even in the context of agape love is agape love is a full surrender to the will and purpose of God. We give ourselves over completely to him. Not knowing what the results are, not knowing what's going to happen, but giving ourselves totally over to him so that he can have his way with us. And even if you can can look at it, God's love towards us calls us to something a lot more than we think of ourselves. A whole lot more than we think of ourselves. And and that's amazing because that's the love that's supposed to be shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost is the kind of love that sees something in someone. I mean, you look at this. You look at the Corinthians. This is another expression of agape love in the Apostle Paul. I read the I read 1 and 2 Corinthians and by the time I'm done, these rotten knuckleheads, what are they doing? They've got they got to they got to rely on Paul to do everything. And here they are. They got all this sin and perversion in in the church, and they're not even doing anything about it. They just let it continue on. And Paul has to make the decision for him. And at the end of the day, what is what does Paul say? He says, "I have confidence in you that the God within you, that the Holy Ghost within you will bring you to the right thing." And I'm like, "Paul, that's a mistaken, misplaced confidence, my friend. What are we doing?" And yet we understand they you read second Corinthians and they did do the right thing and they did put the sin out from from among them and they did follow the order that Paul gave by the scriptures and it's it's what the Lord wants that's the vision I believe that the Lord wants us to have of one another. Yes, we can acknow Jesus is not denying that Peter was a mess. In fact, he was hitting him literally between the eyes and telling them, "Enter into what I have for you. Enter into more. There's that more. There's a higher place that God has for you. There's a deeper walk that he has for you. There's a higher revelation. There's a higher position that he's calling called you into. Keep going forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Feed my sheep." &gt;&gt; Peter Pet uh Lord Lord Jesus um I have to have a word here. Peter has disqualified himself from ministry. He's shown himself as completely unfaithful. And I have to say, I can never look upon him as a minister again. That's how we do. &gt;&gt; And we have a 50/50 chance. Maybe we're right. But maybe the words that we speak, God will take them, plant that in a person's soul and use them and carry them to a pl a level that we never imagined that they could go to. You by your words have the power of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 12 verse 9. And let love, this is the word agape, let agape be without dissimulation. Dissimulation is something that's like concealment of the opinions, sentiments or purpose. It includes the assuming of a false or counterfeit counterfeit appearance which conceals the real opinions or purpose. It's fake is what it's saying. It's don't have a fake love. Don't have a pretend love. Don't say things that you actually don't mean. Say what you mean and do what you say. That's love. Otherwise, it's just like a fake. Another way to look at this is like, you know, in boxing when they throw a fake punch just to throw him off and then hit him here. That's don't love like that. Don't love with a fake punch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it be real. Let it be genuine. Then right along with love, we understand abhore that which is evil. So for love to be correct, there also has to be hatred. Strange. How can it be? How can that be the case? Because we love even our enemies, right? &gt;&gt; Are our enemies evil? I hope so. Oh, I hope they're not good. &gt;&gt; If your enemies are good, then you may want to look in the mirror a little bit and find out if you're good or evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if if our enemies are evil, right, then what's going on here? Love our enemies. There's a there's a vast difference between abhoring that which is evil and abhoring that who is evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? The person themselves is doing evil, but God doesn't call you to hate people that are evil. It it calls He calls you to hate what they do. &gt;&gt; And he calls you even to have boundaries in your life to prevent it from negatively impacting you in a way that would damage your own faith and your own spiritual health. Now, there's some people they have a very high calling, right? and they they can take that evil that that person is doing in such a way. But most of us are not in that condition. We have to have a a strict boundary and not let evil get close to us because it will drag us down to the pit with it. But there are specific gifted people that can go into the face of evil and deal with it &gt;&gt; in such a way that it would it would bring deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And freedom. I believe the Lord's calling us all to be that person. But I also I also know we also have to understand our own weakness. Right. &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, it's it talks about that saving the person who's going into the fire but hating even the garment that's stained by sin, right? And so, wow, you're you're sa you're you're putting yourself at risk to to save someone while also hating their garments, &gt;&gt; which speaks of their works, &gt;&gt; what they've clothed their lives with. And so, my goodness, let's let's come up with a 10step plan to figure that out. I think it's going to take the Holy Spirit in you &gt;&gt; to accomplish such a thing and a lot of prayer &gt;&gt; because it it it's a huge balance to have in all of that to hate what is evil and love your enemy who's evil. But again, it has to be there because if it's not, we will ourselves be polluted by sin and evil. Then it says, "Cleave or hold closely to that which is good." Again, these aren't just a bunch of sentences that are randomly picked by some algorithm and thrown out there. This is Paul writing very specific instructions that are meant to be close together. For love to be without fakeness and falseness, we have to hate that which is evil and cleave to that which is good. Otherwise, it will be a disordered and perverted love. be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another. So in in these two verses it has all three kinds of love that are spoken of in the New Testament. There is a fourth one that the New Testament doesn't speak about but it's in the it's in the Greek language which we'll speak about in a moment. But here it says be kindly affectioned one to another. This is the word fileo stoos. So it's combining two different kinds of love into one word. Felio which is friendship or fondness and stoay which speaks of family love or you can call it affection as they translate it there kindly affectioned. And then the other one is brotherly love. We're all familiar with that. That's Philadelphia. All right. So you have agape fileio sto spoken of there. And the fourth type of love, I can't remember my next screen. Yeah. And the fourth time type of love is called aeros or romantic or as we call it in our day and age, falling in love. And so as we look at this, we got we have divine love, we have friendship, we have affection or family. Stoay is like someone you're in close contact with that you have affection towards. And then romantic love aeros. So the number two, number three, and number four, these are all human loves. &gt;&gt; Love on a human level. And that doesn't mean they're bad, right? We look at them and say they're human loves. We we have to rise above all this and have agape. That's true. And yet these are things that God designed us to be a part of. If you remember, one of the curses of the last days is that people would be without natural affections. &gt;&gt; And so God God put us in bodies to have this. And that's a whole sermon in itself. But God puts us in these bodies and we're in a certain family and we're connected to a certain area and we're connected to a certain church and people around us and people that we work with and so forth and someone that we marry. All of these different things. And these are human loves that he wants us to ha wants us to have and expects us to naturally have. Each of them would be things that are important parts of the human life. without them human life would be utterly intolerable and impossible. So we can't look at it as oh these are bad. If we look at the stature of the perfect man what's before agape Philadelphia &gt;&gt; filio love. So even even within that the Holy Spirit is working within our hearts to bring us to a place where we have the right kind of friendship one to another and sto and aeros all of these different things. If we think about aeros I'll just take a few minutes to to comment on this. If if we look at this romantic type of love that we have it's a good thing. It's a positive thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is part of the human experience. Without it, there would be no more children. You wouldn't be here today &gt;&gt; if there wasn't such a thing called aeros love. Uh and so God has designed us in such a way that our bodies work and we will fall in love with someone. And we but the problem is is that in America and this is kind of the problem all in all in love is that culture tries to define actually what love is and they flip it upside down and they put aos love is the god that rules this earth and they put this as the most important thing and when you fall in love you have to obey that and so when love as CS Lewis says when love reaches its height it ceases to be a god and it turns into a demon because it takes it takes control. It overrides any other thing, any other connection, any truth, goodness, anything I have to do. I have to obey this sensation of falling in love. And again, the the human life you can this falling in love can go in a thousand different directions. It can go in the right direction and it can go in wrong directions. That's what we see many times. a ma a man is at working in close proximity at a job and he's has a secretary and they work in close proximity and they're talking to each other all the time and they're telling about each other's lives and then suddenly they're sharing their hearts and then the next thing you know they're shacking up together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because they fell in love. I'm leaving you because I just don't love you anymore. And this is the level of idiocy that we've reached in in our day today because they have no understanding of what love is. They think it's a feeling, an emotion. It's something comes over you. We don't have any control about it. It's like a virus. It's like COVID 19. We don't have any control over it. It just comes and what do we do? What do we do? I mean, what would you do? I fell in love with this person. Well, &gt;&gt; tell yourself to stop. &gt;&gt; I couldn't do that. Well, we live in a world with people that have no self-control. That's true. &gt;&gt; But if you're a Christian, one of the fruits of the spirit is self-control. And those things can happen to Christians. You can work in close proximity to a sister or to a brother and there maybe there's a problem in your marriage and your husband or your wife is not fulfilling something in your heart that's that's that's troubling you and instead of uh dealing with it one-on-one directly as husband and wife, you start uh catching feelings for someone that's not your spouse. And what do you do that? That should shock you so bad &gt;&gt; that you'll drop everything to make it right with the Lord and with your spouse. Because the thing is, these things do happen. Let's not let's not get our halos so perfectly polished in one another's presence that we don't understand. These things happen. It happens in message churches. It happens to pastors at the pulpit falling in love with someone they're counseling. And what happens? You you have to have boundaries. You have to have you have to understand the limits. You have to know what love is. &gt;&gt; A person that had that really has love will understand and be like Joseph. And even if it leaves them naked, they run as fast as they can &gt;&gt; and get out get out of the place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it it is all of all of these things. And we've so deified it in Disney and Hallmark and all these different places that falling in love is the greatest thing that can ever happen to you. And it's wonderful as long as it's done right. If you're &gt;&gt; if if you're little kids and you're 12 years old and you fall in love and you obey the feelings of falling in love, there's something wrong. If it's especially if it's in a church, where are the parents? They should be involved with their kids to know what's happening in their hearts and in their minds. Amen. And then, you know, you you can take that and people can fall in love and they can get everything out of order and destroy their entire lives by falling in by by quote unquote falling in love. That's fine. It's good. It's good to fall in love. We thank the Lord for it. &gt;&gt; I thank the Lord for it or I wouldn't be here. &gt;&gt; But the issue is what do we do with that? Do we keep it in order? a a young a young lady and a young man. They start talking to each other. The young man gets permission from the young lady's father to speak with her and they begin to fall in love. And she keeps her boundaries. He keeps his boundaries. Dad is always communicating with the boy and with the girl. This is wonderful. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; None of none of us men of God would ever say this is bad. Don't do that. this is happy. This is joyful. Anytime you see, you know, a husband and wife joined together, uh that's that's a cause for rejoicing, especially when they're believers and they're walking with the Lord. It's this is amazing and we love that. But it when we keep it in the right boundaries following the word, that's when God can bless it in such in such a way that he would be glorified even in the midst of our aeros love. See, and I want to keep that in balance because we can speak about falling in love in such a way that we make everybody scared of it and nervous and well, you it's like a superpower that uh you have to be careful about you. It it uh it could make your life amazing or it could ruin the whole city. &gt;&gt; It could save the planet or it could destroy the universe. And so we have to realize that it's something that we don't we don't obey it apart from the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to leave that now. Human loves without its proper balance with divine love at the center of it end up being complicated forms of hatred. Think about it this way. When God tells a husband to love his wife, do you know what word they you that Paul uses to love his wife? Husbands, love your wives even as Christ loved the church. He doesn't use aeros. He uses agape love. &gt;&gt; And so we can fall in and out of love in our lives. And you're married and you've made a eternal commitment to your wife. Divorce is never an answer, never an answer, never an option. You're going to work through everything with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Even then, you'll have times where aos is high and aos is low. Amen. &gt;&gt; These things the this this is normal. It's a part of the experience and young people should know that because when it happens you'll wonder am I getting a divorce? What's happening? No, you're a human being. &gt;&gt; You're living in a human body. No one can maintain a house love every day of their life. Otherwise, they'd never eat. They'd never sleep. They'd never get any ounce of work done. You're not meant to stay in that. And you have to understand that. And when you understand that, your life will be much happier. &gt;&gt; Cuz because we look at it, love is a lot more than a feeling. Love is work. Love is action. All right. So let's think about some situations and circumstances where people speak about love in another way, in a family love. So consider a mother. She loves her son so much she just smothers him. She smothers him to with love to the point he literally can't function as a separate human being from his mother. She won't let him. She has a need in her heart for for some reason there's a lacking in her own heart that in order to feel uh complete as a human being. She has to do everything for her son and she has to control everything for her son. He doesn't know how to take care of himself. He isn't allowed for sure isn't allowed to find a wife because that would break his mother's heart. Everyone would say, "My goodness, this mother sure loves her son." But this is a kind of love that is choking all life out. &gt;&gt; This is a kind of love that's not allowing him to be a man. I would just say, "Where's dad?" Because a mother embraces and protects and nurtures and a father says, "Hey, son, you're going to be a man. Go work. Do something." And mom says, you say, "Quiet. Time for this kid to be a man." All right. I hate to always blame men for stuff, but we're kind of responsible for our homes. Amen. So, this isn't love. Not letting someone grow in their in their just in their human life &gt;&gt; and independence. Uh, this isn't love. Again, it's a complicated form of hatred. Who who would look at this mother and tell her, "You don't love your son." She would say, "Are you crazy? I live for him. I literally live for him." And we say, "You're crazy, actually, cuz you don't even understand what love is. You think love is a form of holding an infant towards you, but this is a 13-year-old boy. This is weird. This is imbalance. This is out of order. Another situation you could consider a mother who lost her son in an early age and she has a family. She has a husband and she spends the rest of her life mourning and complaining about what has happened. Certainly, it's a horrible sorrow. Certainly, she needs counseling. She needs prayer. She needs love. But if she's drowning in her inner sorrow, making her husband miserable, her children miserable, and everyone else around her miserable, it's an imbalance. &gt;&gt; And everybody would say, "My goodness, she loved her son." Again, the son doesn't belong to mother. The son doesn't long belong to father. The son belongs to God. And God decided to take him. And it breaks our heart. And our hearts break together. But at some point, we have to just surrender and say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; you want me to live my life for the rest of my family. You want me to take care of my husband, to take care of my my children, and to enjoy them." And so what what ends up happening is bitterness comes and what it is is an idol has been made out of that sun and everyone has to bow down to it. And if you don't, you'll find out quick that you've committed blasphemy. And again, these are difficult circumstances and situations, no doubt, without question. And we all go through difficult circumstances and and trials, but we have to see God's big picture. And we have to ask the Lord to help us to see the situation through his eyes, &gt;&gt; not merely through our own eyes. Another thing you could consider a father that dotes on spends all his time protecting and guarding his daughters without allowing them to grow. He's focusing all his energy on loving his daughter without spending any time and energy loving his wife. Now if he had love in his heart, true love in his heart, he would understand that the best way to love and protect his daughter is to show how much you love her mother. That that would come first before anything else. And this instinct to protect and guard your daughter is a good thing. But when it stifles her growth, stifer stifles her ability to become a woman, it's not love anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if if we look at this, love often claims for itself divine authority. Actually, it almost always does. When when people speak of love, they look at it and they say, "This is this is everything. This means everything. How can you come against me?" This is why I say they use the term love as a club to beat pe people over the head and control them with it. It isn't love. Love, true love sets free. Amen. &gt;&gt; And love truly given is given freely, not under force or co coercion. All right. Man, have I taken a long time to get this. Not very far. So, let's look at agape. I guess we'll spend the next uh 15 I guess I'll just preach like brother brother Jason does. He goes till about one o'clock. So, we'll do that, too. So looking at Agape, Brother Banham says this, "And hear ye him." Men and women, hear me today as your brother. Let all your little isms and your little sensations drop. Find the love of God. I'd rather have his love than every gift he's got in his kingdom. Give me his love. &gt;&gt; That's what the world is looking for today is to see a display of real love. It'll win souls when you got love. They can tell it when you got love. We got too much makebelief love. We got too much love, felio love, trying to make it agapea love. We real we need real godly love. Amen. &gt;&gt; And from that time, brother Brandham says, "But let me tell you a little secret. The most powerful force in the world isn't speaking with tongues or interpreting tongues or being honored by God to be a minister or to be evangelist or to be a prophet. The most powerful weapon that I've ever found in my life is love. Amen. So, let's think about that for a second. As a as a believer or me as a minister, whatever it might be, we should understand it isn't the anointing that's the most powerful force. It isn't my ability to make you understand what I'm saying is the greatest force. What is the greatest force? It should be the love that I have for the people that I'm preaching to. &gt;&gt; Amen. That would be the place where power would come forth from. That would be the place where there would be uh transformation in people's lives is that the the the the preacher of the word has love and that's the place where the powerful force will come from. It's great to be anointed. It's great to be a good speaker. It's really good that people can understand what you say when you're preaching. &gt;&gt; But that's not it. Love is the thing that's going to bring change and bring transformation. So, brother Bham says the filelio love which the Greek word comes from friendship like you have for your wife. There's a difference. It'll make a a m a mother for that baby run through a blazing fire. Her life life means nothing. That's felio. What will agape o do? See the godly love. We must love divinely love one another. Then you don't see your brother's mistake. If he does make a mistake, you never look you you look over the top of it and you love him anyhow. Jesus is that example in John 21 speaking to Peter. See that's it. Love those that love you then then does this not the sinner do the same thing but love those who doesn't love you. That's what shows the spirit of God is in you because he loved you when you were his enemy and he loved you. And if it's that spirit, if that spirit's in you, it'll make you love your enemy as you do your friend. Now, this is the place where many people get so tripped up. I just, this isn't my my notes, but I feel like this is a a tension that's going on in my mind. So we see that to love our enemy and that mean that to us many times that means throw off all the boundaries. Let them do whatever they want to because Jesus said if someone slaps you on the right cheek, give them the other cheek also. And we take this to mean a lot of different things. And the fact is God himself wants us to have boundaries to not let evil people destroy you &gt;&gt; because evil people will try to take control of your life so that you can never follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit. That isn't love to let someone control you and then they're telling you everything that you should do and then you feel like, well, if I love them, I'll just do everything that they told me to do. Because Jesus said to if someone asked me to go a mile, I should go two miles with them. And so all these scriptures are going through our mind and it's a it becomes a conflict and we find ourselves we have no spiritual life. We have no walk with the Lord. We've been carried on down the line of evil that we never imagined would come into us and it's all because the devil misqued and misused the scriptures in our minds. Love is not a feeling and it's never a feeling that we're supposed to have towards our enemy. It's they're our enemy. You're a human, not an angelic being. You're not God himself. &gt;&gt; He can rise above all that. You're a human. You're God doesn't expect you to to allow evil to control your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just because they ask for something. Evil never stops asking. And God tells us demands that we tell people no. And he demands that we're not equally yolked together with unbelievers. &gt;&gt; I've seen this happen many times. Even in my own life when I was a brand new Christian, I couldn't understand this because all my friends were wanting to do this and do that and it would end up the next thing I knew I was someone's trying to pass me a joint &gt;&gt; or or &gt;&gt; a can of beer and I'm like, what did I do? I was just trying to love my friends and talk to them about the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then I heard a preacher say, "You got to break that yoke. &gt;&gt; There's a yoke that you have together that you've had. You were buddies. You were partying together. You're cussing together. You're doing all this perverted stuff together. Now you're a Christian." And you have to tell him that. You have to say, "I'm a Christian. I'm seeking to follow the Lord." What are you doing? You're placing up a boundary and you're breaking the yoke between you and you're saying, "I'm a Christian. I'm going to follow the Lord. I'm I want you to help me. I want to be your friend. I want you to come to church with me. I want you to know the Lord like I know the Lord. And I want you to help me. So if there's a party, don't invite me. And if I hear about a party, make sure I'm never there. And make sure I don't drink or or smoke marijuana or cuss. You help me towards that. Let's be friends. If not, we can just shake friend hands and leave as friends &gt;&gt; be done. &gt;&gt; And the Lord used that. What does that do? That suddenly takes you from being the influenced to the influencer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? And that's what you have to do. That's what boundaries do. Evil is trying to control you. Evil is trying to manipulate you. Evil is trying to have his hand on you so you can never do what God wants you to do. &gt;&gt; Right? And so boundary says no, I serve one master, the Lord Jesus Christ, not you. And I have to order my life according to the word, not according to what evil people that want to control us would tell us to do. Oh, that's not very nice. Are we call is that a fruit of the spirit? Being nice. It isn't a fruit of the spirit. It's great to be nice, but you can't always be nice if you want to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit. If you read through the four gospels and at the end you say, "Man, Jesus was nice." You are dyslexic or you can't read. Jesus is not nice. G Jesus is dangerous and towards sin and towards evil. And we're supposed to be the same. &gt;&gt; We we're supposed to wield the weapon of the word, not to hurt, but to heal. &gt;&gt; And that's the thing that people don't understand is Jesus is that's many message believers don't understand that they just wield the word like it's a battle axe &gt;&gt; and they're doing it to harm people and build themselves up. No, it's a weapon that's created to heal, &gt;&gt; to cut away evil, to cut away. It's a It's a surgical strike. It's It's not a mad berserker whipping his sword in every direction, doing untold damage to people's hearts and minds. And so we re we realize in all of this agape love is far beyond what we think being nice is. And again, I've I don't know how many times I've said that when I've preached here. If you went and looked at all the things I said, that's probably one of the things I've said over and over again. And it is such a danger because we think that being nice and giving people the things that they ask for is what the Lord wants us to do. And it isn't. It absolutely isn't. Yes, absolutely. There's circumstances when you when when it's time for you to give, don't just give one mile. Give two miles. Give extravagantly. And also, the Lord doesn't even want you to give out of constraint. He wants you to give willingly and as a cheerful giver. So, if you give because you're forced to give, God looks at and says, "What kind of stink is that?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; God doesn't accept our works because we feel like we're forced and trapped into it. He wants us to give freely, willingly, and joyfully. And if we can't, then we have to go examine ourselves before we give to that person that's asked of us. Amen. Does this making sense? &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we look at I'm never g this this I have an entire sermon to preach in 20 minutes. We'll just do the best we can and trust the Lord. From the church ages book, brother Brandham says, you see, they could not figure out God's love. They thought that love meant no suffering. They thought that love meant a baby with parental care. But God said that his love was elective love. The proof of his love is election. that no matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the proof of his love is looking backwards to election. Right? They were chosen by him. No matter what circumstances were, he chose them before the foundation of the world and he loves them and nothing can separate them from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Because God has chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth. He may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That is his prerogative. He is sovereign. But it is all with a purpose. Again, all all the things that we go through have a purpose behind them, right? And so he's not changing subjects. He's talking about love. So in other words, love has a a purpose. in it. &gt;&gt; If he did not have a purpose, then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace. His purpose is that after we have suffered a while, we would be made perfect, be established, strengthened, and settled. As Job said, he puts strength in us. You see, he himself suffered. He learned obedience by the things that he suffered. He was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered. And we'll script skip forward from the uh to the middle there. In plain language, the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering. And according to Paul, he left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering him for him would come to a place of perfection. So here we see that there is a purpose behind the love. So God's God's love has a purpose in it. It has an end in mind. It has a function towards it. It's not just God's feeling towards this. It looks back to election, but that election carries a function in it, which is right here. That he is going to allow circumstances and situations in in our lives. And we can look even deeper and say the word itself, the word itself changes us. And then the word coming up in conflict with circumstances in our lives and us overcoming that's molding us and shaping us into the image of Jesus Christ. If Jesus character was perfected by suffering, the same will be for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the purpose is so that we would grow up and to be in the image of Jesus Christ. So that's God's love. We think God's love is, oh, we're going to heaven. That's it. Well, that's true, but you missed a whole lot of the story. You missed back to election so that his election would carry us all the way through to that place. But then what's in the middle? What's going on in the middle here? Is there no purpose? It's just go out and get big houses and name it and claim it whatever you want. Easy life. No. He is going to bring us through trials and circumstances that cause us to grow into the image of Jesus Christ. So what is God's purpose in love? We've talked about it before in Sunday school class, but it's love. Divine love, real genuine love is a power or force that extends itself for the purpose of spiritual growth in others. &gt;&gt; If we can look at it and understand it that way is this that is love. You say, "Love your enemy." You do. You want their spiritual growth. That's far beyond being nice. You want to see them grow spiritually. And so you'll do like Jesus did because Peter did evil. Let's not just let's not just mix the mix the words. Oh, Peter just made a little mistake. I mean, Peter did evil. He did the thing that's supposed to get us denied before the Father in heaven. He he did an awful thing, a sinful thing. And here was the Lord Jesus looking far beyond that. Not looking merely at the mistake that Peter made. Yes, looking at the mistake he made, but look, as he's looking at it, calling him to something higher and deeper and far further than Peter could ever imagine himself doing at that that moment. That's love. That is love. Because it love's focus is the same focus as God. God's focus is not our comfortability in life. God's focus is that you will be like Jesus Christ. That you will be Jesus Christ in the flesh in this day. Skip this. Love is a power, right? Love extends itself unto others. Love's purpose is spiritual growth. So love is a power that extends itself for the purpose of spiritual growth. So defining evil, the opposite of love. Foundationally, evil is anything that goes against the purpose of God, that fights against the purpose of God. Genesis 3 9-12. Brother Mark, I made this PowerPoint a few weeks ago. So, nobody can blame me for attacking brother Mark. If you don't know what I'm saying, it's it's something that happened in the EV group. He Anyways, God, I love you, brother Mark. You know, and the Lord God Tabby will like this, I'm sure. And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, "Where art thou?" And he said, 'I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself. Uhoh. And he said, Who told thee that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? And the woman And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. Uhoh. What's the problem here? This is evil. How do we know it's evil? Adam was hiding himself. Adam felt guilt himself. And so because of that guilt that he and Eve had, they hid and ran away from the one that they should have been running to. And so out of this guilt, here comes the man. And instead of taking responsibility for his own life, what does he do? He actually in blames God says, "Look, it was the woman you gave me. She's deficient. Not only is she deficient, your choice and your design itself was deficient." That's a that's a huge problem because he refused to take responsibility for his own actions. He not only blamed the his wife, he blamed God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God was coming to the responsible party first because he made man first and he took the woman out of the man. The woman was made for the man. The man was the head of the woman. So he was coming to the responsible responsible party and the responsible party said, "God, you're at fault because your designs are flawed. This is evil. Then the woman says, "The serpent begaled me and I did eat." So Adam says, "God's at fault." And the woman says, "The devil's at fault." But who who reaps the consequences of it? The people at fault. God cursed Adam. God cursed Eve because they're the ones that sinned. And this is the problem of evil in people's lives. The next story, we're all familiar. I just want to go quickly over it. We have Cain. Did Cain take responsibility for his actions? First, he says, "All right, I'll solve this problem that God doesn't accept my offering by eliminating the one who did the more excellent sacrifice. If I eliminate him, then I'll be fine." And God comes and and speaks with him, offers him mercy, offers him grace, and he punishes goes directly to and punishes Cain. And Cain's response is, "I'm sorry, Lord. Forgive me of my sins." He He yells out, "My punishment is greater than I can bear. My goodness, this is evil." And if you think about this, this really summarizes how people behave and act in their lives in a very very significant way. They can never progress. I mean, they can't even progress uh as humans when they're sitting there blaming their problem on someone else, &gt;&gt; let alone to say spiritually. If they can't own the fact that their lives are ruined and they blame it on somebody else, it's their children's fault, it's their wife's fault, it's this person's fault, someone else did it, this the government did it, uh the my wife didn't do this, my this person didn't do that, the church didn't help me, the this person. Never taking responsibility for your own actions and behavior. We have to we have to own the problem. If if there's a problem in our life, it probably is reflected back to us by the mirror. &gt;&gt; And you can we can always put blame on someone else, but God puts us in various circumstances and his Holy Spirit is living within us to help us overcome. And I get it. There's times and there's circumstances to have boundaries and move away from the problem. I I I get that. And that that's absolutely true. And there's times and circumstances where someone is being abused or whatever it might be and they've got to put physical distance between themselves. I'm not saying that. But at the same time, we all have to realize our own responsibility for our own lives. And if we don't do that, then we're doing the opposite of love. We're doing evil. Look at this. Evil seeks to preserve itself. What was Adam doing? What was Eve doing? What was Cain doing? They were It was self-preservation. Pointing the finger at someone else. It's has a scapegoat. Okay, Abel's my problem here. Then God's the problem. The devil's the problem. This one's the problem, but never me. And it has for its purpose the hindrance of spiritual growth. That's what evil's end is. Is to hinder the spiritual growth. not only of itself but of anyone in its own path. Why? Because love exposes that which is evil. &gt;&gt; Love will reveal something that's evil. And what evil's response is? We've all done evil. &gt;&gt; We've all hindered people's spiritual growth. We've all done things in our lives that have been evil. Let's just own that fact right now. At the same time, a person that's truly evil will never own their fault. It will always be someone else's problem. And what are they doing? They're refusing for themselves any kind of growth. And they're hindering anyone around them from ever experiencing spiritual growth on their own. And that's the problem with evil people. They're actually not even aware that they themselves are evil and that they're practicing evil. They think they're normal. They're average. And in most circumstances, they think their judgment is so high and far above others that everyone should submit and surrender themselves to their idea and the way that they look at things. They never evaluate the fruit of their lives. All around them is confusion and hurt and anger, pain, and wickedness. But they'll always tell you very clearly, "What else was I supposed to do? What would you have? You would have done the same thing as me. We're just trying our best to live a good life and to be happy. And what are they doing? They're controlling people around them. They're manipulating people around them. They're telling lies. It's like it's like Lionus in Peanuts. I think it's Lionus who's all he's dirty. Everywhere he goes, there's dirt following. &gt;&gt; That's an evil person. Everywhere he goes, there's dirt following. And he's like, "My goodness, why are all these people so dirty?" You, pal. &gt;&gt; You corrupt everything that you're around. You destroy everything that you're around. And then again, it's not your fault. And I know this sounds extreme, and it is extreme. And there's different levels and layers that this can be manifested. But ultimately, this is the place and this is the problem that God sees and God looks at. Think about the I've I've said this in Sunday school before. Think about the difference between two diff two kings. This is the part I'll close with. You have King Saul and you have King David. Now, King David, what did he what what was his problem? Adultery and murder. crimes punishable by death, right? What was Saul's problem? He followed God's command 99%. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, all of us would look at it and and look at Saul and look at David and say, "My goodness, he attacked the Amalachites. I mean, they're basically done. There's pretty much no one left." And they want to have make a sacrifice. They want to have special meetings. going to have a camp meeting. They're going to make a special sacrifice of of all these animals. My goodness, it's a great revival going on of worship to the Lord. They've got they've got they've got cows, they got sheep, and my it's going to be a big big revival. And uh the prophet comes to both of these men. Samuel comes grieving and says, "What's the sound of this sheep? I've come I've obeyed the commandment of the Lord." That's what Saul says. Hallelujah. Bless God. I've done what the Lord asked me to do. Says, "Why are why what's why is there mooing and and bowing? What's going on here?" &gt;&gt; Right? He said, 'Oh, the people saved some of the best for a special revival meeting for a sacrifice to the Lord. All right. Well, you've rejected the word of the Lord. And because you've rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord has rejected you from being king. And Samuel turns to walk away. What does he do? He grabs He grabs Samuel. Saul grabs Samuel. Why did he want Samuel to stay? Oh, forgive me though. I've I've sinned against the Lord. No, stay. Stay. Honor me in front of the people. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I've sinned, but honor me in front of the people. And And God departs from Saul at that moment. And he's he in God's eyes, he's finished. And here we have the other king. Adultery, murder. He's disqualified himself from ever serving God. In our eyes, he's finished. In our eyes, we take Saul 99 days out of a hundred &gt;&gt; because on the outside, we see someone who did their in our in our mind in obser observation. Boy, he did his best. But those people, you know, it was a hindrance to him. That's not God's heart. That's not God's mind. David over here commits adultery, has the man murdered, and he comes to to David and confronts him and tells us tells a little parable and says, "You're that man. &gt;&gt; You're the killer. You're the adulterer." &gt;&gt; What's David's response? And this is where it's different. And this is where God's vision and viewpoint is so different than ours. &gt;&gt; And I have taken away your sin. Amen. Amazing grace. God is looking far. What was David? What did Saul Saul said? You know what, God? I refuse to grow anymore. And I'm not the problem. The people are the problem. What did David say? Oh, I'm a miserable, wretched sinner. And I need I've sinned against He sinned against man. He sinned against a family, two families. He sinned against a kingdom. But what was his focus? against thee and thee only have I sinned. &gt;&gt; That was the heart of David and God wiped out his sin and removed it as far as the east is from the west. So the problem isn't for in God's mind the problem isn't our individual sin. The problem is what is the our response to him when he confronts us over it? Do do we refuse to receive his love? Because that's ultimately what it is. He's offering to King David and King Saul spiritual growth. Here's an opportunity for you to grow. Would you like to grow? Saul says, "No." What does that show? That shows the value of his relationship with Almighty God. He evalued his image, what he looked like, &gt;&gt; his position higher than he valued God. What did King David say? I've broken the heart of my father. I've sinned against God. And God says, "This is a man after my own heart." I wouldn't say that about an adulterer. That might ruin my ministry. Boy, this adulterous murderer, he's sure a man after my own heart. But look at how much higher God sees. That's elective love. And that's love with a purpose. musicians, if you come. That's a that's love that has a vision of what I'm going to make this man into. Regardless of how messed up he is, he wants to grow. He wants to become more like Jesus Christ. Amen. Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose." Amen. So God is actively working things for good. But remember what do what is good? How do we define what is good? Because verse 35 in Romans 8 says, "Shall tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, or sword separate us from the love of God?" No, it won't separate us. So this good isn't good circumstances in our life. What is the good? Well, the very next verse tells us exactly that. Romans 8:29, for whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be what? Conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. So again, this is looking exactly at what brother Brandham said. Love is elective, right? But that elective love is for a purpose. What's the purpose? So that we would be conformed to the image of his son. That's what God's love is sent for. That's what that's what he's he's dealing with us to to accomplish in our lives. And that's the kind of love that he wants us to have. This isn't just a love that's far off coming down from heaven towards you. This is a love that's supposed to be in every one of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's the love, the agape of God, which is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. So we first have to have this outside source come into us to cause us to be able to have the right kind of love, agape love and not not that's supposed to be our love to God, right? That we love we trust him and we love him regardless of circumstances and we know that his end in mind through all of our circumstances is that we would be like Jesus Christ. This is the ultimate aim. This is this is your purpose in life. &gt;&gt; He wants you to enter into that purpose in your life that divine love is flowing through you. &gt;&gt; It's not a feeling. It's not an emotion. What is it? It's an action. It's God's love coming forth from you. His power working in your your life to bring forth spiritual growth in other people's lives. Amen. That's God's end. That's God's purpose. I love it. Let's stand together. We'll pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your word. We thank you so much for your love for us. Father, we look Lord, we just want to even take a few moments myself, Lord. ask that you'd look upon our hearts and minds and lives, Lord. And if there's places where we're doing evil things, hindering the spiritual growth of our families or those around us, Lord, I pray that you'd convict our hearts and help us to have this vision. Lord to love our families well. We have to have this spiritual growth in mind and we have to have this ordered love according to the word. Not according to our own thoughts, our own feelings, our own emotions, the definitions of the world, but the word flowing forth through us, Lord, that your love would come forth to everyone we meet. Father, we commit ourselves, Lord, to you. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Amazing [Music] grace, how sweet the sound that saved a rich like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I see. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.

When we been there. 10,000 years bright shineing as the sun. Leave no less days to sing God's praise. Then when we first be God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray and we'll dismiss. Gracious Father, we come before you, Lord, and we pray that you'd just water this word by your spirit in our hearts, Lord. We don't just come to church to fulfill our obligation for the week, Lord, but we come to be changed and to &gt;&gt; to be made more like Jesus Christ. Not to be confirmed in our wrong ways of thinking, wrong attitudes, or to hear what we want to hear, Lord. But we come Lord that we would be corrected and that Lord your Holy Spirit would scour out every place in our heart &gt;&gt; that it would only be that perfect love that's coming forth from us. Father, we want to commit each one to you, Lord, this afternoon. Commit them into your hands. Lord, may your hand of grace and your hand of protection and your hand of love be upon each one, Lord, as they go forward. Use them mightily, Lord, in their lives, in their homes, in their families, their places of work. Father, do do mighty supernatural works in their lives for your glory. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you, saints. I'm forgi because you were forsen. [Music] I'm accepted. [Music] You were condemned. I'm alive and well. Your spirit lives within me because you died and rose again.
