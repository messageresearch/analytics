[0:00] as we spoke about before Paul in 1
[0:02] Corinthians 11 the issue is of course
[0:06] head coverings but more than that he's
[0:09] speaking
[0:10] about uh the order order of the order of
[0:13] the creation order of the family order
[0:17] of
[0:18] headship and uh hair is just a
[0:22] reflection of that uh of what creation
[0:27] order is and again people take 1
[0:30] Corinthians 11 actually they take every
[0:32] scripture that has anything to do with
[0:33] man and woman and they try to say it's a
[0:36] cultural impact but you'll find over and
[0:39] over again you know uh that it isn't
[0:43] cultural in any case it is based on
[0:47] creation
[0:48] order uh this the next scripture that we
[0:51] were going to read it's the same thing
[0:54] the order that God has for the home and
[0:56] family is based on the creation the
[0:59] design the nature that God made man and
[1:03] woman with and you know uh one thing
[1:08] that people could sometimes reference is
[1:10] the seron marriage and divorce and this
[1:12] is sort of just a a brief side note it's
[1:16] a topic in and of itself but brother
[1:18] brandom says Satan was Eve's
[1:22] designer and when we hear that we think
[1:24] that Satan was some your initial
[1:27] response is he's trying to say that
[1:28] Satan was involved in in the creation
[1:31] process of
[1:33] Eve that that would be a
[1:35] misunderstanding because as you look
[1:37] further and look deeper into what
[1:39] brother branham's saying he's he said
[1:41] he's design he started working on her
[1:43] first in other words the creation
[1:45] happened the then the de devil this is
[1:48] my means of deceiving and taking over
[1:51] the man which he obviously is not but
[1:57] when we misapply what the prophet said
[1:59] then we are perverting the understanding
[2:01] and revelation of the Scripture it is
[2:04] it's very clear that God was the one
[2:07] that created the man and God was the one
[2:09] that created the woman and he did so
[2:11] with a specific design it's just that he
[2:15] put that design there so that his glory
[2:19] could be made known
[2:21] his his his attributes as Savior and
[2:25] Redeemer and healer etc etc and so
[2:30] that's of course a little bit of a side
[2:31] note but part of the foundation of what
[2:33] we're talking
[2:34] about first Tim Timothy 2:9 in like
[2:37] manner also that women Adorn themselves
[2:40] in modest apparel with shamefacedness
[2:43] and sobriety not with broed hair or gold
[2:47] or pearls or cost the array we we spent
[2:51] uh a little time going into the details
[2:54] on this scripture I'll just hit the high
[2:57] points which is it's God's purpose for a
[3:00] woman to dress modestly and there is in
[3:03] this verse the word apparel is not a
[3:06] general term for clothing just modest
[3:08] clothing but it is actually a specific
[3:10] term in fact there's a number of words
[3:13] within this place that Paul is using the
[3:17] only time that it's ever used in this
[3:19] context in the New Testament in the
[3:22] Greek New Testament and one of those
[3:24] words is apparel which is the word Greek
[3:25] word catasto stole would be a normal
[3:28] term that everyone would wear a
[3:30] stole uh that would just be the common
[3:33] tunic style clothing it wouldn't
[3:37] signify how long it is or what it is
[3:40] it's just like say it's just like saying
[3:42] a t-shirt or a shirt just in a general
[3:45] term a shirt but then he puts in that
[3:47] Kata stole which speaks of the word
[3:50] letting down so letting down stole which
[3:53] speaks of course with as a
[3:55] long dress that's specifically what he
[3:59] is speaking of and if you drill down
[4:01] further and look to a similar term in
[4:05] Hebrew is the word coutet the word cenet
[4:09] speaks of a garment that covers from the
[4:12] neck down to below the knees in in work
[4:15] situations it would go just below the
[4:17] knee in dress occasions it would go all
[4:20] the way a gold necklace or pearl
[4:23] necklace uh or a ring or a bracelet the
[4:27] point the point when he's speaking of
[4:30] this or even that she can't braid her
[4:32] hair there was a specific style that
[4:35] women used to show off their wealth and
[4:37] they would take strands of pearls and
[4:39] gold and we braid them into their hair
[4:42] and it was a means of showing wealth
[4:45] it's not a modest thing it's an immodest
[4:47] thing and and Paul says don't do it
[4:50] brother bandam even connects it with you
[4:53] would consider her a lude woman in that
[4:56] day and time there's nothing wrong with
[4:58] braiding the hair and we don't have the
[5:00] Style thank God of braiding gold and
[5:02] Pearls into the hair although I wouldn't
[5:05] be surprised to see to see it coming
[5:07] back one of these days with these
[5:09] billionaire sex uh
[5:14] Idols in the world
[5:16] am but it's speaking of D it's it's
[5:20] speaking of let your the way you dress
[5:22] be considered shamefacedness and
[5:25] sobriety so shamefacedness speaks of
[5:27] being shy sobriety speaks of being
[5:30] moderate not to the extremes all right
[5:33] let's keep moving but which becometh
[5:36] women professing godliness with good
[5:41] works let the woman learn in Silence
[5:45] with all
[5:47] subjection but I suffer not a woman to
[5:49] teach nor to usurp authority over the
[5:51] man but to be in
[5:54] silence why Paul for Adam was first
[5:58] formed then Eve why else Paul and Adam
[6:02] was not deceived but the woman being
[6:04] deceived was in the
[6:06] transgression not withstanding she shall
[6:09] be saved in childbearing if they
[6:10] continue in faith and charity and
[6:13] Holiness with sobriety again we spoke
[6:16] last time it's not saying that
[6:19] childbearing is the means of Salvation
[6:22] the means of Salvation is the same for
[6:24] men and women it's through Christ alone
[6:27] it's by grace through faith
[6:30] it's not has nothing to do with works
[6:32] but works accompany true faith when you
[6:36] have true Faith true faith is going to
[6:38] then produce the new the new birth the
[6:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then when
[6:44] you have that new nature it's going to
[6:48] produce new works and so Paul is
[6:52] drilling down and saying specifically a
[6:55] woman is ordained to different Works
[6:57] than a man is ordained to so her
[7:01] salvation is accompanied by
[7:05] childbearing if you continue in faith
[7:08] and charity and Holiness with sobriety
[7:11] and when he's speaking of childbearing
[7:12] he's not just saying only the act of
[7:14] childbearing but he's speaking of that
[7:17] nurturing nature that that purpose that
[7:20] plan childbearing child nurturing
[7:23] keeping the home everything it's like
[7:25] putting all the encompassing work of a
[7:28] woman into one simple phrase which is
[7:31] her her specific design that's why Eve
[7:34] was made was to Bear
[7:37] children I know that is not good
[7:41] feminism but thank God we are fighting
[7:45] as hard as we can against the spirit of
[7:47] feminism and we'll speak more about the
[7:49] origins of its release probably next
[7:51] time I doubt we'll get to that that this
[7:54] time in the sermon marriage and divorce
[8:00] notice the reason that she did this she
[8:02] was not in the original creation she's
[8:04] not in God's original creation she's a
[8:06] byproduct therefore at the beginning as
[8:08] Jesus referred to it she was not
[8:10] original creative being of God she is a
[8:12] byproduct of a man when Jesus referred
[8:15] to the beginning remember Adam was both
[8:17] masculine and feminist in the original
[8:19] creation one but then he was separated
[8:22] by a rib notice but a byproduct and
[8:25] notice the only one of all God's
[8:27] creation of every animal and anything
[8:28] else she was the only one designed this
[8:30] way every other female was in the
[8:33] original creation every other female was
[8:34] in the original creation but Eve was not
[8:36] in the original creation see that had to
[8:38] be made that way we'll get to it after a
[8:41] while notice in this creation that she
[8:42] was in not in the original but a
[8:45] byproduct and in this creation there is
[8:47] now I don't want to hurt your feelings
[8:49] but I want to tell you the truth and you
[8:51] just sit still you're doing nice there's
[8:54] nothing designed to be so deceitful as a
[8:56] woman that's deceitful there cannot be
[8:59] nothing else there is nothing made to be
[9:01] that way also is there's nothing that
[9:04] can be so easily deceived as a woman now
[9:07] the fall proves this statement to be
[9:09] true the fall in the beginning she was
[9:11] not in the original creation she was in
[9:13] Adam but not in a female sex herself at
[9:17] the beginning she was the bi byproduct
[9:20] made
[9:22] amen we live in such an evil age that we
[9:27] that we all listen to marriage and
[9:28] divorce the first time
[9:30] and it's like we're getting take a
[9:31] sledgehammer taken to our brains let's
[9:34] be honest with ourselves because the age
[9:36] is so deceiving it shouldn't be that way
[9:40] keep listening to it over and over again
[9:41] so it's not like a sledgehammer because
[9:44] the reason it's a sledg hammer is
[9:45] because perhaps our thinking is
[9:48] perverted and that's what the need for
[9:50] the renewing of our mind is no brother
[9:54] brandham is not denigrating a real godly
[9:57] woman it's it's the Tendencies it's the
[10:00] direction and it's the spirit of the age
[10:02] that he was living in it's not a Godly
[10:06] woman that would be living according to
[10:10] the word that he's speaking about
[10:12] however it is part of the original
[10:15] design and it is part of part of the
[10:17] issue why why do I say that God's
[10:21] original design would have precluded
[10:24] would have prevented the woman from
[10:27] being able to teach or preach or usurp
[10:31] authority over the man it's very
[10:34] clear wh why is that because Adam was
[10:37] first
[10:38] formed So Adam being first formed he is
[10:42] in as the prophet said the original
[10:45] creation now then God put Adam to sleep
[10:48] and took from his side a rib and made
[10:51] Eve so she came out remember how did
[10:54] that process go what was God looking at
[10:57] he said it's not good for for the man to
[10:59] be alone I will make him and help meat
[11:03] so Eve was designed for the purpose of
[11:07] fulfilling something for Adam so Adam
[11:11] wasn't made for the
[11:12] woman the woman was the Eve was made for
[11:17] Adam she's a secondary creation off of
[11:21] him and the prophet gives us reveals
[11:23] this mystery that this is the reason why
[11:26] she could be more easily deceived
[11:28] because she was not in the original
[11:30] creation if you were in the original
[11:32] creation you couldn't be deceived right
[11:35] so because she's off of Adam now she's
[11:39] subject doesn't mean she's necessarily
[11:41] going to be but that she's subject to
[11:43] being deceived so part
[11:45] of part of the nature of how she is
[11:49] created results in the fact that a woman
[11:51] is more easily deceived this is not just
[11:54] a historical Doctrine Paul is saying
[11:57] referring to the creation or
[12:00] impacting on why a woman can't teach or
[12:02] usurp authority over a man amen again we
[12:06] can we can sit here and feel
[12:08] uncomfortable about it or we can just
[12:10] say this is the word we love
[12:12] it once once a person knows who they
[12:16] truly are and knows what their position
[12:19] really is it's not a burden to know what
[12:21] your position is it's a joy to know what
[12:25] your position is now now I can finally
[12:28] feel at rest to be what God really made
[12:31] me to be and to understand the
[12:34] implications of the creation
[12:36] order so again Paul is basing his whole
[12:40] argument not on the fall well the the
[12:44] fall happened and therefore this happen
[12:46] and this is what modern Christian
[12:49] feminist feminists teach and
[12:52] preach the the headship of man is based
[12:55] on the fall and the curse only and
[12:58] therefore
[13:00] uh through Christ all of that is waved
[13:02] off now a woman can preach now a woman
[13:05] can have authority over the man well
[13:08] what in the world is Paul saying this to
[13:11] the New Testament Church he's writing
[13:13] this literally he's actually writing it
[13:15] to Timothy to enact in Ephesus amen so
[13:20] he's saying he's saying this is what I
[13:22] want to happen Timothy and he doesn't
[13:25] say because the Greco Roman culture um
[13:29] regards the man as the patriarch you
[13:32] have to do this in the church no he says
[13:35] Adam was first formed and he was
[13:37] deceived so he takes that historical
[13:41] fact and he brings it forward and places
[13:43] it in the church and says this is why a
[13:46] woman can't teach or preach and why she
[13:48] must remain silent in the
[13:50] church and again the implications are
[13:53] not just for Eve the implications are
[13:56] for all all women to follow just like
[14:00] when Eve when when Adam was cursed it
[14:03] wasn't just a curse for Adam it was for
[14:04] all men following when Eve was cursed it
[14:07] wasn't just for Eve it was for all women
[14:10] following
[14:11] that now let's just take some time to
[14:15] set this in order a woman not be in a
[14:18] position of teaching a man from the
[14:22] Bible that's that's totally out of her
[14:25] order that's totally out of position she
[14:27] cannot be in a position of pastoring a
[14:30] church she cannot be in a position of
[14:33] teaching Sunday school to men she cannot
[14:36] be in a position where she's teaching
[14:39] Doctrine to some man it's the
[14:41] implication here is people will say this
[14:43] is only in the church setting so out of
[14:45] the church setting she can teach
[14:47] theology in a seminary well Seminary is
[14:50] a perversion anyways the place that
[14:52] ministers are supposed to be trained are
[14:54] there in the local church from the the
[14:56] existing Ministry that's there to help
[14:58] them and to train them and raise them up
[15:00] by the power of the holy
[15:02] spirit so there's not some separate
[15:04] office or SE separate place now but the
[15:08] scripture does tell us in a few
[15:10] different places that there is a is a
[15:12] place for a woman to teach isn't that
[15:15] right let's look at the scripture this
[15:18] is from the um uh Jewish translation
[15:21] from the Hebrew Proverbs 1 18 hear my
[15:24] son the instruction of thy father and
[15:26] forsake not the teaching of thy mother
[15:29] so a mother is to teach her family again
[15:32] if we remember from from
[15:34] before this is not to be some remember
[15:37] it says the instruction of thy father
[15:39] and the teaching of thy mother so it's
[15:41] not taking the duty of teaching the
[15:44] family and throwing it only onto
[15:46] mother Ephesians 6:4 specifically says
[15:50] fathers provoke not your children under
[15:52] wrath but raise them up in the
[15:54] instruction and discipline of the Lord
[15:57] so it is first and foremost the father's
[16:00] purview to be sure that he is teaching
[16:04] his family and disciplining his family
[16:07] the mother is then the helper in this
[16:09] Vision the father can't simply say I
[16:13] abdicate my spot here you do it that's
[16:16] not the scriptural intention he is
[16:18] supposed to be the head and the leader
[16:21] of this process but his wife is there
[16:23] also to instruct the children and so we
[16:27] can take from this and understand that
[16:29] in a church setting a sister could a
[16:32] mature sister could instruct children in
[16:34] a Sunday school class as
[16:38] well Titus 2 3-5 I only bring that up
[16:42] just to refer to it speaks of the aged
[16:45] women that she should teach teach who
[16:48] the men no that's usurping the the
[16:51] authority and she's out of position when
[16:52] she does that the aged women or the
[16:55] older women should teach the younger
[16:57] women what
[16:59] theology Doctrine no Christian
[17:03] Living house household duties how to
[17:07] love your husbands how to be sober how
[17:09] to love your children etc
[17:13] etc again so so it's not that a woman is
[17:16] so stupid she can't
[17:18] teach that's not what what Paul is
[17:21] bringing and that's not what Paul is
[17:24] teaching but it's also clear that you
[17:27] know
[17:29] that the woman shouldn't try
[17:33] to teach a man even when Peter says when
[17:37] it's a situation where the wife is a
[17:39] Believer and the husband is UN an
[17:42] unbeliever he says that W that
[17:45] wives should without the
[17:48] word win their husbands using her
[17:52] conduct and character and how she lives
[17:55] as a Believer amen
[17:59] all
[18:01] right continue on and let's look at some
[18:03] quotes from Brother branam regarding
[18:06] these things and when you see a woman
[18:08] acting like a man now again I'm just
[18:11] going to State this General principle is
[18:13] when brother brandham was speaking uh it
[18:16] was not only was the bride in an infant
[18:21] stage or in a seed phase of the true
[18:25] bride being planted but also the
[18:27] prophetic word that was coming forth
[18:29] things that he was re rebuking are
[18:31] Child's Play compared to what we're
[18:33] dealing with if you were back there you
[18:35] would probably think brother bradam why
[18:37] are you getting so carried away it's not
[18:38] that bad but he wasn't speaking just
[18:41] about that time he was speaking
[18:44] prophetically of what was to come and so
[18:46] when you can see that now bring this
[18:49] what he's speaking and you could see
[18:52] that it applies so perfectly to our age
[18:54] in fact it it it applies so well that
[18:57] when we read it we go
[19:00] because we're so we're we're literally
[19:02] swimming in a pool a Cess pool of
[19:05] feminism amen that's this that's the
[19:08] bottomless pit that has been that was
[19:10] opened up in World War I and that's
[19:14] produced this very thing the very things
[19:16] that were produced as soon as the
[19:17] bottomless pit were opened up as we saw
[19:20] in in the fifth trumpet it speaks about
[19:24] hair they had these locusts with hair
[19:26] like women that would haunt the women
[19:29] well what did that haunting produce we
[19:32] see it today the perversion upon
[19:36] women so he says when you see a woman
[19:39] acting like a man she's got out of her
[19:41] place you see in the beginning all right
[19:43] she's I think it's a shame that women
[19:45] has lost their dainty feminist spirit
[19:48] it's a disgrace I tell you it is you
[19:50] know I'm going to say this now I'm not
[19:51] talking about you women here but of
[19:53] course if it hurts it ju it just does
[19:55] but look at me look let me ask you
[19:58] something it used to be that women was
[20:00] so feminist till a man would go to
[20:01] talking to them and they'd blush H what
[20:04] is blushing anyhow I haven't seen it so
[20:07] long I wouldn't even know what it was if
[20:09] some woman blushed they haven't got any
[20:11] of that dignity anymore all that their
[20:14] fine femin Fe feminist Spirit they'll
[20:18] wear clothes like a man cut their hair
[20:19] like a man smoke like a man drink like a
[20:21] man cuss like a man vote like a man work
[20:24] like a man so become rough Burly oh my
[20:26] that shows where you you've got to
[20:29] that's exactly that ladylike you don't
[20:31] see her much more she's a hard person to
[20:33] find isn't that right yes that's the
[20:35] truth so a woman is not supposed to
[20:37] stand up and act like a man big and
[20:39] Burly because she's
[20:41] dainty amen sisters I just want to say
[20:45] say this the spirit of the age can come
[20:47] in and it can pervert the spirit but I
[20:50] just want to encourage you that doesn't
[20:52] have to be what the prophet said can be
[20:55] in you you could say Lord maybe I'm
[20:59] lacking create this spirit in me and God
[21:03] can do it amen amen it's the same it's
[21:06] the same application of wisdom how many
[21:09] of you lack wisdom in certain C
[21:11] situations all of us and he said God
[21:14] tells us if any of you lack Wisdom ask
[21:18] ask in faith God will provide it God
[21:20] Will Supply it the same goes with any
[21:22] anything in that you're lacking if
[21:24] you're lacking humility if you're
[21:26] lacking uh sincerity if you're lacking
[21:29] that feminist
[21:30] Spirit ask God ask God to bring it to
[21:35] you 1 Timothy
[21:38] 5:14 I there I will therefore that the
[21:41] younger women marry bear children guide
[21:44] the house give none occasion to the
[21:46] adversary to speak
[21:49] reproachfully now
[21:52] America Europe Africa everywhere we go
[21:57] we find this Spirit going around the
[21:59] world and that is that there is not a
[22:02] vision to teach this specific scripture
[22:06] to young people to Young sisters what is
[22:09] it everywhere they want to go out and
[22:12] get an education in a university and
[22:14] have a
[22:16] degree now
[22:19] again maybe that's maybe that's
[22:21] something that God has called someone to
[22:23] but it brother brandham presents that
[22:26] more as an exception to the rule rather
[22:28] than the
[22:30] rule because there are circumstances and
[22:33] situations where maybe a husband is is
[22:36] sick disabled etc etc or you feel you
[22:41] could you could also say that's the
[22:42] situation that brother brandham brings
[22:43] up himself or you could say perhaps
[22:46] there's a situation where she feels a
[22:48] calling to be single her whole life
[22:52] maybe that's the case and she would go
[22:54] and and pursue something that would be a
[22:56] womanly type career
[22:59] however that's again a great exception
[23:02] to the rule and really as fathers and in
[23:06] the church we should be pointing people
[23:08] not to the exception but to the
[23:11] scripture uh and I'm just going to say
[23:14] boldly say this from what I see in being
[23:17] a missionary going around the world is
[23:20] this is what we've turned the scripture
[23:21] into I will therefore that the younger
[23:24] women go to university get a career and
[23:27] perhaps if it should might happen can
[23:30] get married and subtract all of that
[23:36] stuff that's not what it says amen I
[23:39] will therefore that the younger women
[23:42] marry bear children guide the house why
[23:46] Paul because it gives an occasion to the
[23:49] adversary to speak
[23:52] reproachfully in the other place that
[23:53] we'll read probably not this time but
[23:56] next time in Titus 2 it says say if a
[23:59] woman wouldn't have this vision and
[24:01] direction for her life that it would be
[24:04] a blasphemy against the word of
[24:06] God and so you could say well our
[24:10] culture demands that we do this and this
[24:13] or all the boys are a bunch of sissies
[24:15] and they they're not growing up and
[24:17] being men they just sit around and play
[24:18] video games and don't learn how to take
[24:20] responsibility therefore a woman should
[24:22] do this well that's another
[24:25] problem fathers what in the world are
[24:28] you doing
[24:30] you're supposed to teach your sons to
[24:32] take responsibility part of being a man
[24:35] is being responsible having a job
[24:37] knowing how to be a
[24:39] provider the scripture says nothing
[24:42] about being really good at video
[24:44] games and I can I can I can go into it
[24:47] it's feminizing men because why you're
[24:51] you're instead of expressing your man
[24:53] your manliness in this Dimension you're
[24:57] expressing it expressing it only in the
[24:59] fourth dimension and when you express
[25:01] manliness only in the fourth dimension
[25:03] it turns you into a
[25:06] I love
[25:08] you I was a young man once believe it or
[25:11] not too I played video games too but I
[25:15] also played Sports and I also got out
[25:17] and into the world the world was a very
[25:20] different place back then but video
[25:23] games are not doing you any favors it
[25:25] would be better for you to forget about
[25:27] video games and go chop some
[25:31] wood learn
[25:33] responsibility and so it's it's
[25:36] a as the prophet said it's a trickle up
[25:39] syndrome you say it's it's juvenile
[25:41] delinquency well no it's parent
[25:44] delinquency well no it's Pulpit
[25:46] delinquency so there's somewhere there's
[25:48] a disconnect from here to
[25:52] here and so I I'm I'm not here
[25:55] to uh rebuke anybody specifically that's
[25:58] not in my heart I have no one in my in
[26:00] in mind this is a general problem that
[26:03] we see around the world it's a spirit of
[26:06] the age but I'll tell you this that it
[26:08] it won't be it it won't change until
[26:11] father and mothers change the vision of
[26:13] their
[26:14] children and so again there's no
[26:17] scripture that says a father can
[26:20] abdicate his authority and a pastor has
[26:22] to take its place the father must take
[26:25] responsibility for leading his family
[26:27] actually if you understand it correctly
[26:30] the truest form of government in the
[26:32] world is not the federal government in
[26:34] Washington DC neither it is it our is it
[26:36] our governor and wherever the heck he is
[26:40] neither is it the
[26:42] mayor many times those things are
[26:45] perverted what's the truest form of
[26:47] government it's the family it's the
[26:50] father he's a ruler he's the Lord of his
[26:53] family and if he doesn't take that
[26:55] Authority the family is going to suffer
[26:58] he must understand his authority to lead
[27:02] his sons and say stop being a boy
[27:05] stop being a little mama's boy it's time
[27:07] to come out it's time to come out from
[27:09] her Apron Strings and be a man it's time
[27:12] to tell the girls to say your purpose in
[27:14] life is to be a mother to be a wife to
[27:17] raise children and to be the best that
[27:20] you can be at that whether you're a boy
[27:22] or a girl for a for a boy you need to
[27:26] develop a work eth
[27:28] amen that you work hard that you're
[27:30] willing to
[27:31] sweat that you're will willing to use
[27:33] your body to provide for a family as a
[27:37] woman and we're training our daughters
[27:40] we have to we have to be willing to
[27:42] train them in the direction that they're
[27:44] supposed to
[27:45] go I don't there's no scripture about
[27:48] government school and
[27:50] university did you know that but there
[27:52] is a scripture about parents instructing
[27:55] their children in the way that they
[27:57] should go
[28:00] so the first Duty and responsibility of
[28:03] Education and Training and teaching is
[28:05] not the church it's not the pastor it's
[28:08] Mom and Dad it's not the government
[28:12] schools it's not the corporate
[28:14] government system it's not the
[28:17] universities it's Mom and
[28:19] Dad and we miss this and we think and we
[28:22] think because I grew up in America or
[28:24] Africa or wherever it is and the system
[28:27] of government schools is in place this
[28:29] is how we must do
[28:31] no it isn't I know I'm you probably
[28:35] think I'm a fanatic but I'm just
[28:37] pointing you to the responsibility of
[28:39] the
[28:41] word the rest the rest you find the
[28:45] leadership of the Holy Spirit but I'm
[28:47] pointing you to the responsibility of
[28:48] the word amen let's pray let's
[28:54] stand Heavenly Father we thank you so
[28:57] much for this glorious message Lord
