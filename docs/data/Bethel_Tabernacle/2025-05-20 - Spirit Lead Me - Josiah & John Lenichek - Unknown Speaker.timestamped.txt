[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] This is my
[0:16] worship. This is my offering.
[0:19] [Music]
[0:22] In every
[0:25] moment, I withhold
[0:29] nothing. I'm learning to trust
[0:33] you. Even when I can't see
[0:37] it, and even in
[0:42] suffering, I have to believe it.
[0:47] If you say it's wrong, then I'll say no.
[0:52] If you say release, I'm letting go. If
[0:56] you're in it with me, I'll begin. When
[1:00] you say to jump, I'm diving in. If you
[1:05] save me still, then I will wait. If you
[1:09] say to trust, I will
[1:12] oy. I don't want to follow my own way.
[1:17] I'm done chasing
[1:20] feelings.
[1:21] Spirit lead
[1:27] [Music]
[1:37] me. It felt like a
[1:42] burden, but once I could grasp
[1:46] it. You took me
[1:50] further, further than I was
[1:54] asking. And simply to see
[1:59] you. It's worth it
[2:03] all. My life is an alter.
[2:08] Let your fire
[2:11] fall. If you say it's wrong, then I'll
[2:15] say no. If you say release, I'm letting
[2:19] go. If you're in it with me, I'll begin.
[2:25] When you say to jump, I'm diving in. If
[2:29] you say be still, then I will wait. If
[2:33] you say to trust, I will oy. Teach me
[2:38] how to follow your way. Done chasing
[2:43] feelings.
[2:45] Spirit, lead
[2:47] [Music]
[2:56] me. When all hope is
[2:59] gone and your word is all I've
[3:04] got, I have to
[3:07] believe. You still bring water from the
[3:12] rocks to satisfy my
[3:16] thirst. To love me at my
[3:20] worst. And even when I don't
[3:25] remember, you remind me of my
[3:29] worth. I don't trust my
[3:33] ways. I'm trading in my
[3:37] thoughts. I lay down
[3:41] everything. Cuz you're all that I
[3:46] want. I land it on my knees.
[3:50] This is the cup you have for me.
[3:55] And even when it don't make
[3:58] sense, I'm going to let you spot
[4:04] [Applause]
[4:10] [Music]
[4:14] [Applause]
[4:24] Let your spirit
[4:28] lead
[4:30] [Music]
[4:32] me.
[4:33] Spirit lead
[4:36] [Music]
[4:39] me. Holy Spirit lead
[4:45] [Music]
[4:48] me. Spirit lead me.
[4:54] [Applause]
[4:58] Spirit, lead
[5:01] me. And if you say it's wrong, then I'll
[5:05] say no. If you say release, I'm letting
[5:10] go. If you're in it with me, I'll begin.
[5:15] And when you say to jump, I'm diving in.
[5:19] If you save me still, then I will wait.
[5:24] If you say to trust, I will oy. You're
[5:28] the only truth for life away. Done
[5:32] chasing
[5:34] feelings. Spirit, lead
[5:38] [Music]
[5:42] me. Spirit, lead me.
[5:49] [Music]
[5:55] [Applause]
