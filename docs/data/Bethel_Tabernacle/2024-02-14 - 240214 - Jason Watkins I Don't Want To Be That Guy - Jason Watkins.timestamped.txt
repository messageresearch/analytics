[7:29] [Music]
[7:41] so many times I've
[7:44] questioned certain
[7:45] [Music]
[7:47] circumstances and things I could
[7:50] [Music]
[7:51] not
[7:53] [Music]
[7:54] understand many times and
[7:58] trials weakness blurs my vision and my
[8:03] frustration gets so out of
[8:08] hand oh but it's then I am
[8:11] reminded that I've never been
[8:15] forsaken I've never had to stand one
[8:19] test
[8:22] alone as I look at all the
[8:25] victories the spirit Rises up and me and
[8:30] it's through the fire my weaknesses made
[8:35] strong
[8:37] oh he never promised that the cross
[8:41] would not be heavy and the hill would
[8:45] not be hard to
[8:48] climb oh no and he never
[8:53] offered our victories without fighting
[8:57] but he said help would all always come
[9:00] in
[9:03] time just remember when you're
[9:06] standing in that Valley of
[9:10] decision and the adversary says
[9:16] give just hold
[9:20] on our Lord will show
[9:23] up and he will take you through the fire
[9:28] again
[9:29] and
[9:32] oh I know within myself that I would
[9:36] surely
[9:38] perish but if I trust the mighty hand of
[9:41] God he'll Shield the Flames
[9:47] again
[9:51] again he never promised that the cross
[9:55] would not get heavy and the hill would
[9:59] would not be hard to
[10:03] clim oh no and he never offered our
[10:09] victories without fighting but he said
[10:12] help would always come in
[10:17] time just remember when you're standing
[10:22] in that Valley of decision and the
[10:27] adversary says give up been given oh you
[10:31] just keep holding
[10:34] on our Lord will show
[10:38] up and he will take you through the fire
[10:43] again so just hold
[10:48] on my God will show
[10:51] up and he will take you through the fire

[20:48] um
[20:50] 11-6 and then we're going to uh come
[20:53] back over to the New Testament we'll
[20:55] pick up 1 Thessalonians 5
[20:59] amen praise
[21:01] God Amen glad to see y'all out on a
[21:04] Wednesday night God bless you amen we're
[21:07] going to take up some prayer requests uh
[21:09] here just shortly amen but we amen want
[21:12] to see what the Lord has for us in the
[21:14] word amen praise the Lord I'm going to
[21:16] take an unusual title tonight and
[21:21] um titles are huge to me so I really
[21:25] thought about this one a lot I thought
[21:27] about not using
[21:29] it but I want to use it that be all
[21:33] right I'm gonna take a title tonight I
[21:36] don't want to be that guy that's
[21:40] right amen praise the Lord let's look in
[21:43] Jeremiah chapter
[21:46] 10 verse
[21:48] 11-
[21:54] 16
[21:56] amen thus shall you say unto
[21:59] them the gods that have not made the
[22:02] heavens and the
[22:04] Earth even they Shall Perish from the
[22:07] earth and from under the
[22:11] heavens he hath made the Earth by his
[22:15] power he hath established the World by
[22:19] his wisdom and hath stretched out the
[22:22] heavens by his discretion sounds like
[22:26] the prophet is trying to set the record
[22:29] straight of who built everything there's
[22:32] obviously some some opinion among the
[22:36] people that maybe it was some other God
[22:39] all right so we've got a divided opinion
[22:42] here and the Lord is sending a prophet
[22:44] to set the record straight verse
[22:47] 13 when he utth his voice there is a
[22:51] multitude of waters in the heavens and
[22:55] he causeth the vapors to descend from
[22:58] the ends of the Earth he maketh
[23:01] Lightnings with rain and bringeth forth
[23:03] the wind out of his
[23:05] treasures every man is brutish in his
[23:09] knowledge every founder is confounded by
[23:12] the Graven image for his molten image is
[23:16] falsehood and there is no breath in them
[23:20] they are
[23:21] vanity and the work
[23:26] ofation they Shall Perish ish I think
[23:28] this is an exceptionally relevant
[23:31] scripture given that we are in such an
[23:34] age of
[23:35] idolatry and everything is an idol these
[23:38] days verse 16 I love this look at him
[23:41] draw the line of
[23:43] demarcation the portion of
[23:46] Jacob is not like
[23:48] them amen the portion of Jacob is not
[23:52] like them for he is the former of all
[23:56] things and Israel is the rod of his
[24:01] inheritance the Lord of hosts is his
[24:05] name
[24:07] amen let's let's pray then we'll go to
[24:10] second I mean 1 Thessalonians 5
[24:13] Lord we commit now the reading of the
[24:15] word into your care and I just settle
[24:19] myself now Lord into this unusual
[24:22] approach tonight to a sermon and I am
[24:25] asking for your Divine favor Lord that
[24:27] you will help help me Lord to deliver it
[24:30] as it has evolved opening up to me I
[24:33] pray this in the name of Jesus Christ
[24:36] amen I'm going to dismiss you guys y'all
[24:38] can head on off and we'll turn to first
[24:41] Thessalonians 5 amen while we still have
[24:44] you
[24:48] standing 1 Thessalonians
[24:51] 5 is um really special to me because it
[24:56] was the second text I ever took in a
[25:00] sermon amen I I took my very first
[25:03] sermon out of brother bram's message in
[25:06] influence in Chicago in
[25:07] 1963 and so naturally I went to where he
[25:11] went to in Isaiah 6 the Lord high and
[25:13] lifted up but uh when I came to this
[25:17] second sermon ever way back 30 plus
[25:21] years ago I preached a sermon called
[25:23] identification and I wanted to show that
[25:27] you're not them and they ain't you right
[25:30] all right we've already read where God
[25:33] has said the portion of Jacob is not
[25:36] like these false gods the portion of
[25:39] Jacob is the true God and I'm not like
[25:42] those false gods I'm not a Graven image
[25:46] I'm not just something that doesn't have
[25:48] any life in it I'm a living being amen
[25:53] and now you're going to find that the
[25:55] holy spirit is going to lead St Paul
[25:57] Paul to show the church that they're not
[26:01] at least they're not supposed to be like
[26:04] The World God you remember the story
[26:07] brother brandham tells about the slave
[26:10] how that he had come he was a royalty in
[26:12] Africa and here in slavery though
[26:15] brother Bram said though A Slave he knew
[26:18] where he'd come from he knew his real
[26:21] identity and said though here A Slave he
[26:24] conducted himself like a King's son and
[26:27] the prophet said That's you and I we're
[26:29] right here in in in um walking among
[26:32] those slaves to sin the world is slaved
[26:35] to sin but while we're here we are
[26:38] realizing that we're not from here we're
[26:41] not finishing here thank
[26:44] God oh my friends we have a home waiting
[26:49] a royalty amen and you you want to take
[26:52] notice of that fact as we read in 1
[26:55] Thessalonians 5 uh I read a more of it
[26:59] when I preached that second sermon I'm
[27:00] only going to read verses 4-9 right now
[27:04] but ye
[27:06] Brethren are not in darkness he spoke
[27:09] about people who are in darkness but ye
[27:12] Brethren are not in darkness that that
[27:14] day should overtake you as a thief he
[27:16] had just got done saying to those who
[27:18] are walking in darkness that day of
[27:21] judgment shall overtake them as a thief
[27:24] now you don't know a thief's coming he
[27:25] surprises you all right right so they're
[27:28] going to get a
[27:31] surprise cuz the raptures nothing like
[27:33] they
[27:34] think the tribulation is nothing like
[27:37] they think the Millennium is nothing
[27:40] like they think the Judgment bar is
[27:42] nothing like they think see verse
[27:45] five ye are all the children of light
[27:50] and the children of the day we are not
[27:52] of the night nor of Darkness therefore
[27:56] because of that since that is true
[27:59] having now understood what I just said
[28:01] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[28:05] but let us watch and be sober so clearly
[28:09] you're not supposed to be like them CU
[28:12] you're not
[28:14] them you're his and our mission here is
[28:19] to find all of his and persuade them to
[28:22] be like him
[28:26] amen
[28:28] verse 8 but let us who are of the day be
[28:34] sober putting on the breastplate of
[28:37] faith and love and for in helmet the
[28:40] hope of Salvation so you got something
[28:42] to do so Christianity is not just me
[28:46] memory
[28:47] verse amen it's not just a form it's not
[28:50] just a tradition it's an
[28:53] experience all right you put on
[28:56] something you put on the breastplate of
[28:58] Faith you wear it you know everybody in
[29:01] here I can see what you got
[29:04] on because you're wearing it you ought
[29:07] people ought to be able to see the
[29:09] Christianity because you're wearing it
[29:12] amen there ought to be no no no
[29:16] mistaking you know I I if if I if if
[29:21] Matt is wearing this brownish collar
[29:23] jacket I'm not going to come in here and
[29:25] go hey Matt that's a really nice yellow
[29:26] jacket
[29:28] well you would think I'm crazy well when
[29:31] people say I'm a Christian but they
[29:33] don't look like
[29:36] this I don't know what garment you have
[29:38] on but the gospel produces the same kind
[29:42] of garment on
[29:44] everybody so he
[29:46] says but let us who are of the day be
[29:48] sober putting on the breastplate of
[29:50] faith and love and for an helmet the
[29:52] hope of salvation for God hath not a
[29:57] pointed us to wrath that's good
[30:01] news so what are you going to do with
[30:06] it I'm here to give you good news he has
[30:09] a he has not appointed you to wrath so

[30:32] so God hath not appointed us to wrath
[30:36] has he appointed us to something since
[30:38] he has not appointed us to wrath yes but
[30:40] to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus

[32:05] he's flippant he's he's he's forceful he
[32:09] he has he's he's
[32:11] opinionated he exalts his own thinking
[32:14] above the thinking of God and above the
[32:17] word he esteems himself too highly I
[32:20] don't want to be that guy you know I I
[32:24] the one of the reasons that I was
[32:26] telling sister debb
[32:27] and it's it's my inspiration I know you
[32:29] can't look at it and see that I'm very
[32:31] inspired but believe me I am I was
[32:33] sitting in Walmart and she was or a
[32:35] grocery store somewhere and she was and
[32:37] I was sitting there and I and I seen
[32:39] this poor old gentleman come in aged
[32:42] well-aged and just completely bent over
[32:45] and just shuffling in little two-inch
[32:47] steps I felt terribly sorry for him and
[32:50] I thought to myself I am I don't want to
[32:53] be that guy I I don't want to get that
[32:55] age and be old and decrep it if I get
[32:57] that way please push me over a cliff
[33:00] well off take me to the mountains and
[33:01] push me or take me out Mike take me
[33:03] surfing push me off the board buddy amen
[33:06] you got my permission if you see me like
[33:08] that praise the Lord even sister Debbie
[33:10] will want you to do
[33:13] that
[33:16] amen but I don't want to be a brutish
[33:18] guy I don't want to be a pinion I don't
[33:20] want to be of the night I don't want to
[33:23] sleep in the day I want to be awake in
[33:25] the day I want to be vigilant I want to
[33:27] be sober the world is going to
[33:29] destruction men are men are going to die
[33:33] and brother brandham called him Atomic F
[33:36] I don't want to be those guys they're
[33:37] going to die by the millions I don't
[33:39] want to be those guys and it's not going
[33:40] to be God's
[33:42] fault we've proven that many many
[33:47] times so we found out that not only is
[33:50] God different but God expects his people
[33:54] to be different that's what we
[33:55] discovered it between Jeremiah 10 and 1
[33:59] Thessalonians
[34:01] 5 so now I could have I could have
[34:05] easily included women sisters just
[34:07] you're included in this thought tonight
[34:10] uh because of the principle now I could
[34:13] have I could have put a bunch of Bible
[34:15] women up here who are who are in the
[34:17] Bible I could have started I could have
[34:19] started with Eve and I could have
[34:21] finished with the great harlot in the
[34:22] Book of Revelation I could have got the
[34:25] women in the crowd of musicians and
[34:28] friends who laughed Jesus to scorn when
[34:31] he's coming to raise the daughter of Jas
[34:35] and they're right there in his house
[34:36] laughing at him I could have taken
[34:38] herodias and her daughter uh in Matthew
[34:41] 14 who called for the head of John the
[34:44] Baptist you sisters you you want to say
[34:46] I don't want to be that
[34:48] gal
[34:50] poor she called for the head of John the
[34:53] Baptist how many sisters would say I
[34:55] don't want to be that gal see I could
[34:58] have taken the two different women who
[35:00] pointed out Peter and outed him as a
[35:03] follower of Jesus at the trial there
[35:05] that night to stir up the crowd and
[35:07] cause trouble in Matthew 26 I I could
[35:10] have spoken about the women uh The woman
[35:13] there in uh acts 16 who had the spirit
[35:16] of divination who followed Paul and
[35:18] Silas
[35:22] around motive in doing that she had an
[35:25] evil spirit
[35:27] so there there's plenty of women in the
[35:30] Bible I could have started with Jezebel
[35:32] there's plenty of women in the Bible
[35:34] sisters who you could fairly say tonight
[35:37] with the brothers and I'm going to take
[35:39] some men out of the Bible and men are
[35:41] going to say I don't want to be that guy
[35:43] and you sisters can say I don't want to
[35:44] be that
[35:49] girl
[35:51] oh just make sure you uh did that do
[35:54] that automatically or did you do that
[35:56] Esther yeah okay okay sis just leave
[35:57] that on and so cuz uh I want to have it
[36:00] a certain effect amen thank you that
[36:03] that that's what you're supposed to do
[36:04] but tonight I want an
[36:12] exception four men who failed
[36:18] God four
[36:20] men who had a
[36:23] chance
[36:25] Judas from left to
[36:28] right
[36:30] Judas the Rich Young
[36:33] Ruler the nephew of Abraham
[36:38] lot king joash of
[36:45] Israel when we think of Judas scariot as
[36:48] Matthew 26:14 says then one of the 12
[36:51] called Judas es scariot went unto the
[36:53] chief priest he was going as you know
[36:55] the story he's going to betray the Lord
[36:59] and you know it's it's amazing when I
[37:03] read about it in the scripture and when
[37:06] he comes to Jesus there in the night and
[37:09] the soldiers are behind him in Jesus he
[37:11] says whomever I greet with a kiss this
[37:14] is the one you take him and you and and
[37:17] he comes to Jesus to greet him with the
[37:20] the son of man with a kiss think there's
[37:23] no coming back from that have you really
[37:28] thought it through that this decision
[37:31] all it is for you is a decision but it
[37:34] will seal your Eternal
[37:39] Destiny when I think about that I think
[37:41] about how that God gave
[37:44] Judas an opportunity to not go through
[37:47] with it but I think that that the
[37:51] decision that Judas made and this is
[37:53] just brother Jason
[37:55] tonight I I think that the decision that
[37:58] Judas made was a
[38:00] decision that he made
[38:03] ultimately by that I mean that he had
[38:06] been on a path of decisions all along
[38:09] the way following Jesus you don't come
[38:12] to a decision like that in a moment just
[38:15] like Jesus you've heard me say it before
[38:17] Jesus went to Calvary because he had
[38:19] been going to Calvary his whole
[38:21] life he was preparing for that you tell
[38:24] me how old he was when he first how old
[38:26] was he when he first picked up the book
[38:28] of Isaiah and he read about he shall be
[38:32] as a lamb led to the slaughter how old
[38:34] was he was he eight was he 10 was he 12
[38:37] he was a human child and he reads that
[38:40] verse and he realizes suddenly that's
[38:48] me he was making these decisions Judas
[38:52] was all along the path along the way
[38:56] following Jesus making them while while
[39:00] going in that direction all along at
[39:04] every point at at every point and I want
[39:06] to talk about those points tonight those
[39:09] those elusive hardto detect points in
[39:12] our lives where we are unaware that we
[39:16] are making decisions that are going to
[39:19] shape the destiny of our life
[39:22] am we we make so many decisions in a in
[39:25] a in any given day
[39:27] and sometimes the thing will get on our
[39:28] mind and God will challenge us and don't
[39:30] think Satan won't be there to challenge
[39:32] you to try to get you to take his path
[39:35] and I just want to say with you with
[39:36] with the prophet of God choose Christ
[39:39] choose the word always every time all
[39:43] the
[39:44] time because it you don't realize that
[39:48] sometimes they're very hard to detect
[39:50] these points in our lives I I was
[39:52] speaking to to a young man one time and
[39:56] well you know I'll just I'll just have
[39:58] to say it who it is and it was my
[39:59] younger brother who I believe God took
[40:02] him took home a a uh an unrepentant
[40:06] child that's my belief that's where my
[40:08] faith is and uh and I believe it
[40:12] especially since I've seen him on the
[40:13] other side and and I know he's there and
[40:17] so so we find that you know one time he
[40:21] said to me Jay the lord loves you more
[40:23] than he does me I said why you say that
[40:25] Nate he says well look at your life and
[40:27] look at mine your life is blessed and my
[40:29] life is so cursed and upside down I said
[40:31] just a second little bro just a second I
[40:34] said you put your feet under the same
[40:37] kitchen table that I
[40:39] did we slept in the same bed we had the
[40:43] same parents we went to the same church
[40:45] we had the same Pastor every age that
[40:48] you reached I reached you were 16 once I
[40:52] was 16 once you were 20 I was 20 ahead
[40:55] of you you finally got to 25 I've been
[40:57] to
[40:59] 25 I said the difference is that at
[41:02] every one of those points we were making
[41:05] different
[41:08] choices so it's not your parents fault
[41:11] God's fault your pastor's fault your
[41:14] friend's fault anybody's fault it's not
[41:16] even completely the devil's fault you
[41:19] need to say it's me oh Lord standing in
[41:21] the need of
[41:25] prayer
[41:27] I'm glad for the choice God made to
[41:29] bring a wayward son
[41:33] home Judas could have changed
[41:37] course anyone can but at each point he
[41:41] stayed on a course that led him to what
[41:44] I would call an irrevocable conclusion
[41:46] about Christ the ultimate that ultimate
[41:49] conclusion then informed his final
[41:52] decision and by the time Jesus offered
[41:55] him that at pause he was already
[41:58] determined and committed to
[42:03] betrayal I don't think he made that
[42:06] decision
[42:12] overnight not at
[42:17] all that's a rather haunting look in the
[42:20] eyes if you ask
[42:22] me brother brandham speaks of how Jud
[42:26] thought that Jesus could get out of it
[42:30] he thought
[42:32] wrong now Jesus could get out of it but
[42:35] he wasn't going to get out of it because
[42:38] that was the plan of God the plan of God
[42:42] for Jesus was that he go
[42:45] forward in this sense Judas doomed
[42:49] himself by failing to understand the
[42:53] word of God for his hour amen if he
[42:57] thought that Jesus could get out of it
[42:59] and would get out of it he clearly
[43:02] didn't understand the word of his day at
[43:04] that moment it's fair to say that none
[43:07] of the disciples did but it is a lesson
[43:10] for us tonight friends you want to no
[43:12] wonder brother brandham said pray for
[43:14] Revelation above everything because you
[43:16] don't want to make a wrong decision
[43:18] because you don't understand the day and
[43:21] the hour that you
[43:23] live that's why billions are going down
[43:26] an atomic destruction of their own
[43:29] doing because they fail like Judas they
[43:33] fail to to know the word for their
[43:36] hour see so you know I would just say
[43:41] tonight that sometimes we come across
[43:44] things in the word we don't understand
[43:46] sometimes things happen in life that we
[43:48] don't understand but I want to say to
[43:50] you that just because you don't
[43:52] understand something God has said or
[43:54] something God has did or something that
[43:57] God has allowed don't resist him stay
[44:02] humble whatever you do stay surrendered
[44:07] and ask him to make it clear just start
[44:10] knocking just start knocking say Lord I
[44:12] need to understand this part of your
[44:14] word I need to understand this thing
[44:16] that happened in my life I need to
[44:17] understand why you allow that and don't
[44:20] stop knocking until he
[44:24] opens Jesus and invited you to ask and
[44:27] it shall be given you seek and you shall
[44:30] find knock and it shall be opened unto
[44:33] you for everyone that
[44:35] askthe findeth and to him that knocketh
[44:38] brother R said that meant to just
[44:40] continually
[44:41] knock and just keep on knocking until
[44:44] when yeah for how
[44:47] long Lord you getting tired but how
[44:49] brother brandom Lord you getting tired
[44:50] of me out here knocking I ain't leaving
[44:53] I need an answer and I'm just going to
[44:55] keep r on knocking I'm here to tell you
[44:57] something friends even a an unjust judge
[45:00] will finally get up and open the door
[45:02] how much more your heavenly
[45:09] father the next one in our left to right
[45:15] line was the Rich Young
[45:19] Ruler Mark 10:17 and when he was gone
[45:22] forth into the way there came one
[45:24] running y to him and ask him good Master
[45:29] what shall I do that I may inherit
[45:33] eternal
[45:35] life my what a
[45:38] question you talking about an
[45:40] opportunity
[45:43] squandered this man had it all
[45:47] riches power
[45:50] influence youth health strength had so
[45:55] much that he had to he thought I'm going
[45:57] to tear my barns down and tomorrow I'm
[45:59] going to build bigger ones and he didn't
[46:02] know that there was an angel standing
[46:05] behind him and said you
[46:07] fool this very night you're unaware that
[46:11] this very night you've got plans for
[46:14] tomorrow that you'll never
[46:17] see this very night your soul is going
[46:20] to be required of you and he stood there
[46:23] someone who I mean I mean this you're
[46:26] talking about a man who had it all even
[46:28] Jesus loved
[46:31] him someone who knew the Commandments
[46:35] and had observed them from his youth but
[46:38] yet still lacking eternal life brother
[46:42] Brenham says he was a very successful
[46:45] that's his words a successful religious
[46:49] businessman
[46:51] amen he says in the message leadership I
[46:54] would recommend that every man man
[46:56] especially young men and and and the
[46:59] sisters again alike here
[47:04] brother californ de the 7th 1965 one of
[47:08] the last it's his actually his last text
[47:11] sermon he preaches a communion service
[47:13] uh after that but this is his last text
[47:18] sermon so brother brandham says it like
[47:23] this talking about this rich
[47:26] ruler how that he was a successful
[47:30] businessman nothing had went
[47:32] wrong he was perfectly cut out right
[47:36] measured up right intelligent right
[47:40] education his success he was smart a
[47:43] fine businessman probably belonged to
[47:45] the businessman's group somewhere in
[47:47] Palestine he might have belonged to a
[47:49] businessman's fellowship like we have
[47:51] here tonight no doubt he did because
[47:53] businessmen has always had fellowships
[47:55] with one another one with the other and
[47:58] he W listen to this and he was as
[48:03] religious as he could
[48:07] be now I just want you to absorb that
[48:10] he's as religious as he could be but he
[48:14] didn't have eternal
[48:16] life so I think it's safe to say that
[48:19] you need to be something more than you
[48:22] can
[48:23] be amen you need to be something he can
[48:27] make out of
[48:30] you he he was as religious as he could
[48:34] be because Jesus had questioned him here
[48:38] and he said I have kept these
[48:41] Commandments observe them all from my
[48:43] youth that's right see and he had been
[48:45] brought ight taught right and this is a
[48:49] prophet and
[48:51] everything no wonder I started with you
[48:54] talking about an opportunity squandered
[48:56] he had
[49:00] everything but when he was
[49:02] confronted with the thought of eternal
[49:05] life now I want you to notice with all
[49:07] this character that he had yet he knew
[49:10] he did not possess eternal life it's why
[49:12] he
[49:13] asked see he had been he had been
[49:16] brought upright he says all right with
[49:18] all of this character yet he knew he did
[49:19] not possess eternal life and no matter
[49:21] how successful we've been in business
[49:23] how successful successful we've been
[49:26] and what a great church member we are
[49:28] and how we work how we try to do things
[49:32] right thank you God bless you that's
[49:35] wonderful I could compliment every last
[49:37] one of you Brothers in here tonight
[49:39] you're successful you're businessmen
[49:41] you've done good God has blessed you
[49:43] Jesus loves
[49:45] you but do you have eternal life
[49:51] amen no matter how successful we've been
[49:54] in business how successful we've been
[49:55] and what a great church member we are
[49:57] and how we work and how we try to do
[49:59] things right
[50:00] still if it's not done in the right way
[50:04] it is a worship of God in vain now think
[50:08] now think listen to this a
[50:12] sincere honest worship with the
[50:16] sincerity of your heart to
[50:19] God and still be in
[50:24] vain prophet says but here was his
[50:28] problem he
[50:29] refused to be guided he refused to
[50:35] accept the real leadership of Jesus
[50:38] Christ to give him eternal life you're
[50:41] talking about an opportunity
[50:47] squandered I don't want to be that guy I
[50:50] don't want to be that guy I don't want
[50:52] to be that
[50:53] guy Brothers

[53:06] on pray just a second in Your Heart Lord
[53:10] let me see it open your understanding
[53:13] may God do it just take this nation
[53:16] alone let's see what God
[53:18] Said the Bible said that the sins of
[53:22] Sodom vexed his righteous soul
[53:27] daily he just didn't have the plain
[53:34] nerve enough to stand out against
[53:39] it I don't want to be that
[53:43] guy George I don't want to be that guy I
[53:46] don't want to be that guy brother Mark I
[53:47] don't want to be that guy JD I don't
[53:50] want to be that guy how about you
[53:53] Brothers I want to have the nerve to
[53:55] stand against it I'm not against people
[53:58] but I'm against the spirit of the age
[54:00] come on young people get in I want I
[54:02] don't want to be
[54:03] that amen I don't want to be that Dan
[54:06] Danny I don't want to be that I I I want
[54:08] to have a enough courage to stand
[54:11] against the age that we live in and say
[54:14] this is ungodly and I'm not a part of it
[54:17] I'm from a different world I marched to
[54:19] a different
[54:24] drum the Bible says the Sin of Sodom
[54:26] vexed his righteous Soul the righteous
[54:29] soul of lot daily he just didn't have
[54:31] the plain nerve enough to stand out
[54:32] against it that's right he couldn't do
[54:33] it he was the mayor of the city he
[54:36] couldn't but the Bible said the sins of
[54:37] the sodomites vexed his soul he knowed
[54:39] it was
[54:41] wrong but he didn't have nerve to do
[54:44] it to stand out against
[54:49] it just didn't have the plain
[54:52] nerve to stand against it
[54:57] now
[54:59] look how many Lots in
[55:01] America yesterday reading their Bible to
[55:06] prepare their message for the day and
[55:09] run across water baptism in the name of
[55:11] Jesus Christ how many of them run across
[55:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus
[55:15] Christ same yesterday and forever Mark
[55:18] 16 these signs shall follow them that
[55:19] believe John 14 he that believeth on me
[55:22] the works of do shall he do also if you
[55:23] abide in me in my word and you shall ask
[55:25] what you will it shall be done how many
[55:26] Lots saw that but because of their
[55:30] excuse of their
[55:32] denomination look out and see in the
[55:35] Bible look at their Congregation of Bob
[55:38] haired women and they know the Bible
[55:40] condemns it look going down the street
[55:42] at their own church members going down
[55:43] the street with shorts on and they know
[55:45] the word is against it but they haven't
[55:48] got the nerve to call out against it but
[55:51] yet the man professing to be a Christian
[55:53] his soul within him cries out against it
[55:56] but he hasn't got the nerve if that
[55:58] ain't a modern Sodom where is it at I
[56:02] don't want to be that man when I'm in my
[56:06] study and I come across the scripture I
[56:08] want to be able to come to this pull pit
[56:10] and preach to you the whole counsel of
[56:14] God brother brandham says give us
[56:16] somebody that'll cry out against it

[56:50] truth in the face of criticism in the
[56:53] face of a Dying World that's getting
[56:56] worse by the
[56:58] hour I'm believing that you don't want
[57:05] compromise am I

[57:14] find our next man joash king of
[57:19] Israel this is the king brother Bram
[57:21] called him a backslid king that came to
[57:24] the to the deathbed of Elisha now Elisha
[57:26] was Fallen sick of his sickness whereof
[57:28] he died and joash the king of Israel
[57:31] came down unto him and wept over his
[57:33] face The Story Goes On you've read it
[57:36] many times where the Elisha revived a
[57:40] little bit and and he told him said take
[57:42] your bow and open the window and said
[57:45] fire your arrows and when he fired an
[57:48] arrow he said the arrow of the Lord's
[57:51] deliverance and he said now take your
[57:53] quiver and smash it on the ground ground
[57:55] and this Half Baked half-hearted
[57:58] lukewarm Israelite King the direct
[58:01] descendant of
[58:03] David God's chosen
[58:06] people whack whack whack okay I did my
[58:10] duty and the prophet was angry said you

[1:01:57] the television you know that's true why
[1:02:01] you know that's the gate way of all
[1:02:02] Hollywood out there why it's nothing
[1:02:04] else but a bunch of big prostitution and
[1:02:06] some of the vulgar watch him now and
[1:02:09] Elijah Eli Elisha said go get your bow
[1:02:14] and he put an arrow in and said open the
[1:02:16] window towards the east the East is the
[1:02:19] way that Jesus will come and he said now
[1:02:21] watch now I want you to put the arrow in
[1:02:24] the place and draw back as far as you
[1:02:27] can and he did it he said shoot and when
[1:02:31] he shot what happened the arrow went out
[1:02:34] he said get the arrow and when he come
[1:02:36] back said Strike It On The Ground he
[1:02:37] struck the ground three times and the
[1:02:39] prophet was wroth with him and said why'
[1:02:41] you why' you strike it why' you strike
[1:02:44] it more times than that why didn't you
[1:02:47] do something else about it strike it

[1:03:41] this story in the Old Testament as a
[1:03:44] type to the modern church today and
[1:03:45] connects it to the upper room that Arrow
[1:03:48] of
[1:03:49] Deliverance see he says the same the
[1:03:52] same's happening tonight in the
[1:03:54] Christian church we have struck the
[1:03:57] arrow of God's Deliverance he said it
[1:03:59] was God sent the arrow of Deliverance to
[1:04:01] us the arrow of Deliverance is the holy
[1:04:04] spirit that's been sent shot from the
[1:04:06] bow of God's love isn't that a beautiful
[1:04:08] way to say it shot from the bow of God's
[1:04:11] love when the eternity to Eternity was
[1:04:13] pulled together by the cord of love he
[1:04:15] shot the arrow of Deliverance into the

[1:04:38] supposed to be lot you're supposed to be
[1:04:40] up there with
[1:04:43] Abraham he says the holy
[1:04:46] spirit will deliver the church out of
[1:04:49] any kind of chaos it could get into but
[1:04:52] what does it do with it
[1:04:54] they picked up the arrow and they struck
[1:04:56] three times that's a backsliding king
[1:04:59] they struck the arrow once well we'll
[1:05:01] build a church that's all right they
[1:05:03] strike the arrow we'll teach theology

[1:06:33] stories are for our admonition that we
[1:06:36] don't fall into the same
[1:06:38] problems I don't want to be that man I
[1:06:41] don't want to be that man at
[1:06:43] all I don't want to be for men who had a
[1:06:51] chance say brother Jason you've
[1:06:55] pretty much eliminated every kind of man
[1:06:56] there is pray tell what kind of a man
[1:06:59] would you rather
[1:07:01] be I thought about that today and I made
[1:07:06] a
[1:07:07] decision rather than be like any one of
[1:07:10] these four
[1:07:11] men I'd rather be an old
[1:07:14] Infidel almost gone from the world
[1:07:18] living way back in the hills of Kentucky
[1:07:21] sitting under an apple tree minding my
[1:07:23] own business
[1:07:24] and have the one and only Ministry come
[1:07:27] along that could open up my
[1:07:32] eyes that
[1:07:34] friends is what I would like to
[1:07:37] be I'll take that over following Jesus
[1:07:42] for In the Flesh for three and a half
[1:07:45] years as a make believer I'll take that
[1:07:47] over being a rich young powerful
[1:07:49] businessman ready to tear down my Barns
[1:07:51] and build build big ones I'll take that
[1:07:55] I'll take that over being a backslid
[1:07:57] king I'll take that over being the
[1:07:59] nephew of God's Prophet only to prove in
[1:08:02] the end that I'm just a foolish virgin
[1:08:04] living in Sodom without the courage to
[1:08:06] stand on God's word I'll take that I'll
[1:08:10] be an old Infidel sitting under an apple
[1:08:12] tree and the one Ministry that can
[1:08:15] finally open my eyes comes my
[1:08:17] way Hallelujah friends I think about a
[1:08:20] man who was a true son of the Living God
[1:08:24] God a true son of the Living
[1:08:27] God now you you probably can't see it up
[1:08:30] close how it happened I'll never know
[1:08:33] this is a AI image and all I did was
[1:08:36] tell it give it the
[1:08:37] prompt how it put a man in that rocking
[1:08:40] chair that looks like brother brandom
[1:08:42] with a rod in his hand I will never
[1:08:47] know but I thought of this before I did
[1:08:50] that I'll tell you that and I would
[1:08:53] rather I know I I I I I I would rather
[1:08:56] be a
[1:08:57] man that's a true son of the Living
[1:09:01] God and
[1:09:03] have I mean here's a man who who never
[1:09:07] knew who he
[1:09:10] was never never I mean here he is he's a
[1:09:13] true son of the Living God he's lived
[1:09:15] his whole life he's a true son of the
[1:09:18] Living God and had never known that
[1:09:21] about himself he had never even known
[1:09:23] God at all he didn't didn't know who he
[1:09:24] was he didn't know about God he didn't
[1:09:28] even believe that there was a God he was
[1:09:31] completely unaware of the creator of all
[1:09:35] things he was unaware that his father
[1:09:39] was the king of the
[1:09:42] universe He was unaware he I mean h h
[1:09:47] how is that even
[1:09:48] possible for a Son of God who's an
[1:09:52] elected child of God who a prophet's
[1:09:54] going to go catch him in his old age and
[1:09:56] the very next year when brother brandham
[1:09:58] comes back and he tells a story of
[1:10:00] leadership he said I come back the next
[1:10:02] year and said he was already he was gone
[1:10:05] and said I went hunting and come back
[1:10:08] and there was his wife and she gave me a
[1:10:10] right good ball and out said oh you you
[1:10:12] Indiana's people you think you can just
[1:10:14] come over here and run all over us
[1:10:16] kuckian and he said well lady if you
[1:10:18] just give me a chance he said I I
[1:10:20] thought I had permission you do not have
[1:10:22] permission who gave you permission he
[1:10:24] says well I I don't know exactly he said
[1:10:26] he was an old guy and he was sitting out
[1:10:28] back there under that apple tree and and
[1:10:30] I started talking to him about
[1:10:34] God Hand That same tree and she dropped
[1:10:38] it and she said are you brother
[1:10:39] brandom he said yes she said I'm sorry
[1:10:43] she said I didn't know who you were she
[1:10:44] said let me give you his testimony
[1:10:46] brother brandom said he died with his
[1:10:48] hands up in the air shouting he died
[1:10:51] with his hands up in the air shouting he
[1:10:53] brother R him said he knew just the same
[1:10:55] God that took that sap down in the tree
[1:10:57] and took those apples off but brought
[1:10:59] them back up he said he knew on
[1:11:01] Resurrection he'll come back around I
[1:11:03] want to be that
[1:11:05] guy hallelujah oh I want to be that guy
[1:11:09] that's that's who I want to be today I
[1:11:11] want to be a man like Abraham who looked
[1:11:14] for a city which hath Foundation who
[1:11:17] Builder and maker is God I want to be a
[1:11:20] man like Moses who refused to be called
[1:11:22] the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing
[1:11:25] rather choosing rather to suffer
[1:11:28] Affliction with the people of God than
[1:11:30] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:11:32] season what kind of a woman do you want
[1:11:34] to be sisters today by faith the Harlot
[1:11:37] Rahab perish not with them that believe
[1:11:41] not by faith women received their dead
[1:11:43] raised to life again and others were
[1:11:45] tortured not accepting Deliverance that
[1:11:47] they might obtain a better resurrection
[1:11:50] and others had Trials of cruel mockings
[1:11:52] and scourgings yet moreover of bonds and
[1:11:55] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[1:11:57] swn aund they were tempted were slain
[1:11:59] with a sword they wondered about in

[1:12:25] thing for us that they without us should
[1:12:29] not be made perfect I want to tell you
[1:12:33] something friends all you have to do

[1:12:49] have is that your desire friends that's
[1:12:51] my desire that's my whole heart to you

[1:13:08] it how many want to take it

[1:14:09] Lord three and a half years and all

[1:14:23] decisions aren't made overnight Satan
[1:14:26] leads you down a path and as I said at
[1:14:28] the very beginning I am sure that along
[1:14:30] the way those imperceptible moments when
[1:14:34] Judas was kept making the the same
[1:14:37] decision that kept taking him in the
[1:14:39] right direction I mean in the in the
[1:14:41] direction that he would end up with in
[1:14:42] the wrong direction and you know what
[1:14:45] God rich in Mercy gave him a chance you
[1:14:49] have a chance tonight if you find
[1:14:51] yourself Brothers if you find yourself
