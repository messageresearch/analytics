[0:03] so many times i've questioned
[0:06] certain circumstances
[0:10] and things i could not understand
[0:17] many times in trials
[0:21] weakness blurs my vision
[0:24] and my frustration it gets so
[0:27] out of hand
[0:31] but it's then i am reminded
[0:35] i've never been forsaken
[0:38] i've never had to stand one test alone
[0:45] as i look at all the victories
[0:49] the spirit rises up in me
[0:52] and it's through the fire my weakness is
[0:56] made strong
[1:00] he never promised that the cross would
[1:04] not get heavy
[1:06] and the hill would not be hard to
[1:14] he never offered
[1:17] our victories without fighting but he
[1:20] said help would always come in time
[1:27] just remember when you're standing
[1:31] in the valley of decision
[1:34] and the
[1:35] adversary says give it
[1:47] [Music]
[1:56] i know that in myself that i would
[2:00] surely perish
[2:03] but if i trust the mighty hand of god
[2:06] he'll shield the flames again
[2:11] again
[2:16] he never promised that the cross would
[2:19] not be heavy
[2:38] [Music]
[2:45] is
[3:02] and he will take you through the fire
[3:06] again
[3:09] oh
[3:11] i know within myself that i would surely
[3:16] perish but if i trust the mighty hand of
[3:20] god he'll shield the flames again
[3:27] [Music]
[3:30] oh he never promised
[3:33] that your cross would not get heavy
[3:36] and the heel would not be hard to
[3:41] climb
[3:44] and he never offered
[3:47] our victories without fighting but he
[3:50] said your help would always come in time
[3:57] just remember when you're standing
[4:00] you're in that valley of decision
[4:04] and the
[4:05] adversary says
[4:08] given
[4:09] you just hold on
[4:14] our lord will show up
[4:17] and he will take you through the fire
[4:21] again
[4:22] [Music]
[4:29] you
