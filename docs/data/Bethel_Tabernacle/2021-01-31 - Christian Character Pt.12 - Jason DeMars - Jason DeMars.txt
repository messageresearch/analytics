TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning everyone god bless you let's stand and pray heavenly father we just come to you lord and we ask that you would take your word this morning and make it living and and real lord may meet us right where we're at father and and touch our hearts draw us closer to you lord may we each one step out of the way that your spirit could flow through us and that you would be glorified in us father we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen all right we're going to look at our opening scripture isaiah 14 13-15 i'm going to be speaking on christian character part 12 and looking at humility for the second time for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit and then genesis chapter 3 verses 4 and 5. and you can pull that up in the our regular king james version i am going to read it from the english standard version very similar but a little bit different emphasis but the serpent said to the woman you will not surely die for god knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil you will be like god where it's translated in the king james as uh gods it's from the word elohim it's speaking that they will be like god so may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so you will be like god it's very interesting that satan uses that in the temptation of the woman when it was the very thing that got him he wanted to be like the most high only no doubt there was a great jealousy that was taking place there because weren't they already like the most they were made in his image and likeness right so he was offering something she already had and what what what was it she was deceived right she didn't really comprehend precisely what was happening she was deceived into thinking it was a good thing well we're made in the image of like the likeness of god so if i do this i'll be more like god so let's go for it and it it dealt with what pride so we're talking about humility what is the opposite of humility it's pride they're two they're two things that go directly together and diametrically opposed to each other pride is the root of the first sin in heaven and pride is the root of the first sin on earth okay so then humility must be a root of something as well it seems to me that humility is the root of all godly holy character being holy means being humble andrew murray writes this the root of all virtue and grace of all faith and acceptable worship is that we know that we have nothing but what we receive and bow in deepest humility to wait upon god for it that's the root of all virtue and grace we have nothing i am nothing we have nothing everything that we have comes from god any good that i have accomplished is not me it's him and i have no reason to think i'm extra special because of it or i'm better than other people because of it it causes us to bow in deepest humility to say god hath wrought this let's define humility in ethics freedom from is from webster's dictionary an ethics it's freedom from pride and arrogance humbleness of mind a modest estimate of one's own worth in theology humility consists in lowliness of mind a deep sense of one's own unworthiness in the sight of god self-abasement penitence for sin and submission to the divine will how's that for a dictionary that's that's the original noah webster's dictionary that that's coming from so i believe humility is often an overlooked characteristic of a believer we talk about love we talk about submission we we talk about the fear of the lord we talk about kindness etc but i think the root of all of that starts with humility if we don't have if we're not humble if we have pride any goodness that we have is actually corrupted any good thing that we attempt to do becomes corrupted and you know we we tend to look at things in stark contrast someone's proud as an unbeliever he's proud he's an unbeliever right we're not talking necessarily in that sense you can be a good solid christian you can be a solid preacher and struggle with pride we're not we're not talking about hey we're you all you're humble i'm just patting you on the back i'm humble i'm patting myself on the back no i'm talking about us as christians have pride to fight and battle against constantly satan will always give us a counterfeit to what is real we can go forward and we can be in love and take pride in the love that we have we can be kind and take pride in the kindness that we have but what does it really do with that it actually corrupts every single thing that we do and in god's sight it's a because the the sacrifices that we make become a stench and so in the christian walk think of pride and humility as a a a spectrum as a temperature a gauge you have zero and then it goes down goes down to whatever negative 30 or something negative 35 and it goes up to 120. so this is a gauge you know as you fill yourself more up with pride it gets hotter and hotter and hotter but as you empty yourself in that thermometer as you empty yourself it gets you get more and more humble and we all can be in a different stage in our walk in a different place in our walk and so the issue is not i'm i'm a christian so i'm of course empty of any pride oops probably just come out again oh my so what is pride pride is inordinate self-esteem an unreasonable conceit of one's own superiority in talents beauty wealth accomplishments rank or elevation in office office which manifests itself in lofty heirs distance reverence and often in contempt of others pride is demanding something from other people it's really demanding submission reverence from other people toward it needs this was what needs to come towards me you've got to respect me because my christian accomplishments god doesn't care for that it don't it means nothing to god what your accomplishment accomplishments are i mean think about what how the prophet talks about great and grand orators and preachers as compared to that little humble woman who cleared out her chicken coop to have a revival in it and she did spent all her money and did all she could and it brought one convert and that was a great thing in the sight of god so it isn't about having a position a place being recognized that's not how we're supposed to live and walk and act none of that matters to god if that mattered to god he never would have cast satan down to hell he was right next to god's throne no one could claim a greater degree of position than lucifer the angel of light the the anointed cherub that covers the presence of god yet he was cast down to hell why because he said i will i will what is humility means it's if god wills i'm going to do what god wants me to do it's submission to him so again pride and humility is a measurement of self i'm going to read andrew murray again he says here is the path to the higher life down lower down just as the water always seeks and fills the lowest place so the moment god finds men abased and empty his glory and power flow in to exalt and to bless let's read first peter 5 verse 5. likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and here's the part i want to emphasize and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble so we're going to stay on that verse um to be clothed with something as a figure of speech to mean that you are to become that thing you're clothed with right clothed with humility so the word clothed there from the greek it speaks of an ornamental garment tied with knots or bows which can signify a lot of different things but in particular it's looking at the outer garment of a servant which is intended to be as a guard over the top of their normal daily garment and it identifies them as a servant right so when someone would see them in society they would immediately say this is a servant so us being clothed with humility what does it speak of that garment of humility that we put on identifies us as a servant of jesus christ so we want to put on this garment we want to be clothed with humility not clothed with pride and our life speaks our life speaks exactly what we are regarding that you can't help it a person that's full of pride it's so easy to recognize person that's humble it's easy to recognize as well and then he says for god this is a quote of proverbs i believe proverbs chapter 3 i didn't write it down proverbs chapter 3 verse 34 maybe something like that for god resists the proud but gives grace to the humble so he resists the proud the word really resists doesn't fully speak of what's happening there the word resist from the thayer's greek dictionary says to range in battle against so think about that god resists the proud god actually girds himself puts his sword on his side and but not only that the word range means to set in a row or in rows to place in a regular line lines or ranks to range men or ships in the order of battle so he's ranging he's he's literally assembling a heavenly military with him leading it against the proud that's the danger of pride is that now you have god as an enemy okay now in the christian experience god can never truly be your enemy right he loves you but in our experience we can come to this place of pride where everything that we do has god resisting in other words you're lacking his blessing upon what you're doing and you're facing continual constant frustration of your plans and designs and in a way that's got really that's god's love that's god's love to hedge you in and hem you into the right way but if we if we continue in the wrong way god is going to take us off the scene you don't lose your salvation but you definitely lose god's blessing in this his temporary blessing in this life you don't ever lose god's eternal blessing but you get into this place where man everything i do is just in ruination you know and in a bigger picture the world pride god arrays himself against those who lift themselves up in pride but giveth grace to the humble james 4 6 says but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble so when he's saying he resists the proud but gives grace to the humble i don't think this is talking about the grace that brings you salvation right because no one can actually be humble until god changes your heart so this isn't talking about this is talking about us in the christian experience he giveth more grace we increase we grow in grace we grace is multiplied peter says in another place and so we want grace to be multiplied right we want to experience more grace he giveth more favor grace means god's unmerited favor that he gives to us he giveth more grace so in the christian experience god resists the proud but gives grace to the humble there's no way to get humble unless god changes your heart by nature you're not humble now there's degrees and lengths of that of course just as there's degrees of uh there's adolf hitler and then there's someone who's good all their life but never repents never lives for god maybe they drink and smoke and so forth there's levels of what i'm talking about and and yet the reality is you can't truly be a god-centered humility unless he changes your heart so again continued grace we want continued grace we want multiplied grace not just temporary things like homes and cars and things those are those are just side side things that we appreciate we thank god for they all come from his hand but we're not looking for that really we're looking for spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ jesus and so when god resists the proud it means you're going to stop growing you're going to stop moving on you're going to stop advancing in your christian walk you're going to stay exactly stagnated right there until you humble yourself and then when you humble yourself he giveth more grace isaiah 66 1 and 2. thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that you build unto me and where is the place of my rest for all those things hath mine hand made not only has he made him he owns them and all those things have been saith the lord but to this man will i look he didn't change subjects he's talking about where's the place of my rest where do i where do i make my dwelling place this man will i look even to the hymn that is poor that word poor is humble lowly and of a contrite literally means a smitten spirit and trembles at my word so we want god to live in us we want to experience his presence more and more right how do you want to experience his present presence more and more humble yourself be contrite but not only that tremble have it means speaks of reverence have a reverence have a trembling at his word we don't just treat it like it's common it's not common god's god's word means should mean everything to us and it should give us such we should have such a reverence for it that when we read it and we find that we don't line up with it we should tremble why because we never want to displease the lord we never want to find him a rang an army of heaven against us humble contrite trembles at his word god is spirit he he can't dwell just in one place god is spirit he do he cove covers all space and time the prophet said heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee the scripture says and it's not about it's not about temples and churches and having a big big place to worship in beautiful everything's up to date perfect that's not what god is looking for might be what we're looking for but god is not looking for that at all what is he looking for someone that worships him in spirit and in truth stumble that someone that's humble contrite trembles at the word where is he looking to dwell in humble hearts humble hearts brother branham says this and humble thyself in july 1963 you show me a church that's humble real humble humble not arrogancy a church just a sweet humble church i'll show you a church that has the favor and power of god in it that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before god letting god just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise sometimes as the farmer said he went out to the field with his wagon and every time he hit a bump it just rattled and went on but he come back he hit the same bump and didn't make no noise at all because it was loaded with good things so i think that's just about right see we that we just get filled up with the good things of god that the fruit of the spirit might be known through us what is he talking about the fruit of the spirit i was expecting him say the gifts of the spirit but he said the fruit of the spirit what is the fruit of the spirit the character of jesus christ it don't have to make a lot of noise it might make noise it might make not might not make noise it might be it might be you shout and scream but it might be yours you can't say a word because you're so convicted in the presence of god there's a balance to all of it be still and know that i am god be still you don't have to jump and shout and run around just be still and know that he is god get yourself under him there's nothing against shouting that's not brother branham saying don't shout don't say amen don't say hallelujah don't because you're not supposed to sit like a bump of the log the word of god should can should make you excited and happy but other times the word makes you tremble and you can't say a word the point is let the let god move let him fill you with good things so that you go along the road steady right i'd rather be steady than to be emotionally up and down in this way and that way steady in the center of god's word we can i love shouting i love saying amen i'm not speaking against that but i'm saying there's priorities living the word is the priority you can mimic any of those outward things but you're not going to mimic the character of jesus christ truly you're not going to mimic or mimic the word living in the bride producing the character of jesus christ and the works of jesus christ and it comes from what being humble humble yourselves we want the power of god moving in this church right we're desperate for it we want that in every life we want the power of god going out to the people that have left the church that have said bad things about us that have turned against us we want to see them repenting we want to see them living for god loving god why do we want to see that because we love those people we want to see the best for them not because we want seats full but we want people loving serving steady amen in the reality of jesus christ matthew 11 29 and 30. take my yoke upon you take my yoke upon you this is directly a jewish saying from the rabbis they talk about taking two different yokes in order in order to take the yoke of the commandments you have to take the yoke of the kingdom so you take the yoke of the kingdom then you can take the yoke of the commandments and jesus is saying i got something else for you i got something new for you i got a different yoke for you that's totally distinct from this other yoke this yolk that's heavy that's that the the pharisees and the sadducees they put upon this heavy yoke upon you and it's not light and it's burdensome and it's impossible for you to carry it and not only that no one is helping you carry it it's all up to you so what does jesus say take my yoke upon you learn of me not the rabbis not all not all the rabbinical writings from the last 500 years he's saying but take my yoke what is it what is a yolk you everybody knows what a yolk is you buy you bring two oxen together to pull something so he's saying take my yoke come on i'll pull with you learn of me i'm the expert here i know what i'm doing i know how to i know how to do it so come come next to me i will help you pull this new yoke for i am meek for i am meek i'm humble and lowly in heart and you shall find rest for your souls jesus christ is our first example of what it means to be humble he said i do nothing of mine own self he said my word is not my own he says the miracles you see it's not me doing them it's the father that dwells in me he was humble he submitted himself he said i can do nothing of mine own self that is what it means to be humble i can do nothing of myself i have nothing of myself everything that i do have and do it's him so let's take that yoke upon ourselves it's not what we can do and get up and we can speak this and we can do that and of course those things are true we can speak but we don't speak of our own self we don't speak of our own will we're not speaking money into our bank account for selfish reasons we're believing god to provide for our needs we're walking with him brother branham told us exactly what it was to speak the word his experience i was wondering about that scripture what do you need squirrels speak the squirrels did william branham come up with the idea did he just go out and start speaking stuff into existence every time the spoken word came he was prompted to do it amen don't get confused can you can you speak the word sister can you speak the word you can when god tells you to can i speak the word yes when god commands me to i've seen it i've seen god do it it's the absolute truth but we're talking about humility here we're talking about the yoke of jesus christ meek and lowly not high and lofty and proud meek and lowly i'm nothing i have nothing but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ and what what will we find what will we find when we take this yoke upon us this yoke of humility and meekness meekness is not weakness meekness means you're able to be led of god moses was the mecus he wasn't weak there was nothing weak about moses when god dealt with him and spoke with him moses was meek in other words he did nothing he spoke nothing until god told him to do it so we want that yoke upon ourselves we want to find what rest for our souls it becomes rest humility becomes rest do you want rest do you want peace humble yourselves it's not about what you can do it's not about what you can achieve just about getting yourself out of the way and having ears to hear the voice of the spirit and be led by him you'll find rest for your souls 4 30 for my yoke is easy and my burden is light okay the picture is not that there's not work to do a yoke means work you means effort a yoke means sweat right don't don't get it wrong by looking at easy about easy and a light burden it's simply saying i'm right next to you the author and finisher of your salvation is right next to you the bishop of your soul is right next to you pulling with you but you have to pull two yeah you you have effort too but the thing is when when your savior is next to you all things are possible amen and that is a place of rest because it's him working it's him moving you're just following you belong to him but it takes that humble heart to follow to hear and to take that yoke amen let's stand and pray heavenly father we thank you so much for your word i pray that you would take it make it alive and real to our hearts father humble ourselves under your hand help us let that not be just a ethereal word lord that's out there of humility but lord help i pray that there was flesh put to that there was light shed on what that word means and and what it looks like lord and just move in us lord move in in us through this day pour your spirit out upon us through the worship through the preaching of the word we we want more of you lord we commit ourselves to you in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you
