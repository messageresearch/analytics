[0:00] if you have your Bible we'll just read
[0:01] straight from the scripture amen
[0:04] here this morning
[0:08] Zechariah Chapter 12 I don't hear myself
[0:10] at all up here like I'm not on by the
[0:12] Brad not sure if the monitors are down
[0:15] that's on good praise the Lord
[0:17] Zechariah Chapter 12 I'd like to just
[0:20] teach this morning and we took a little
[0:22] bit when we preached Wednesday
[0:24] and I just took a little snippet out of
[0:27] that didn't really get to cover my
[0:29] materials so lord gave me this chance
[0:31] this morning so today will just be a
[0:33] Bible teaching and I just pray you get
[0:35] something out of it I want to title this
[0:37] teaching the spirit of Grace
[0:40] and supplications the spirit of Grace
[0:43] and supplications let's just begin
[0:45] reading at verse two we'll just read a
[0:48] few verses then we'll turn to chapter
[0:49] 14. behold I will make Jerusalem a cup
[0:53] of trembling unto all the people round
[0:56] about
[0:57] when they shall be in The Siege both
[1:00] against Judah
[1:02] and against Jerusalem and in that day
[1:04] while I make Jerusalem a burden some
[1:07] stone for all people notice everybody
[1:10] this is God's saying I'm going to do
[1:14] this there's many things Israel's done
[1:16] to bring upon themself but God says I'm
[1:19] going to do this the Holocaust
[1:21] God did that
[1:23] I need you to understand that that's so
[1:25] important it's it's it opens the door to
[1:28] everything that happens in the second
[1:30] phase of what we're reading about now
[1:32] with Israel the Holocaust was something
[1:36] God did now that's trouble for your mind
[1:39] for the Christian mind and the
[1:41] non-Christian mind to say that God
[1:44] brought up brought about the Holocaust
[1:47] is hard for us to understand and we know
[1:50] a prophet would go further than that and
[1:52] say that was the tender loving hand of
[1:56] Jehovah
[1:57] now you read that what God is saying
[1:59] here this is something I'm going to do
[2:01] if you go read the book of Deuteronomy
[2:03] you'll find uh profitic things even
[2:07] about the Holocaust and if you want to
[2:09] want that reference I'll give it to you
[2:10] after the teaching but we're not looking
[2:13] at that we're looking at this this is
[2:15] this is part two this is the you could
[2:17] almost call this the second Holocaust
[2:22] that's my own that's brother Matt you
[2:23] don't have to accept that Bible doesn't
[2:25] say that brother Branham doesn't say
[2:26] that but if you read about what God is
[2:29] saying is going to come upon Jerusalem
[2:33] it's not a bright sunny picture it's a
[2:36] very dark one now it's a dark one that
[2:38] gets dark but at the darkest moment it
[2:41] turns to light
[2:43] because the Bible says then God will
[2:45] come himself and defend Jerusalem but
[2:48] before it gets light it gets really
[2:50] really really dark now that should show
[2:53] you something about your future as well
[2:57] that at the darkest moment when all
[2:59] seems like everything is lost then God
[3:02] steps in the scene can you say Amen
[3:05] let's read here verse verse uh three
[3:08] again and I will make them a burdensome
[3:10] stone for all people all that burden
[3:11] themselves with it shall be cut in
[3:13] pieces through all the people of the
[3:14] earth be gathered together against it
[3:17] you can be seated this morning
[3:22] let's just begin continue reading that
[3:24] verse eight let's just continue on here
[3:26] we'll get to what we can and then we'll
[3:27] move to part two Lord willing next time
[3:30] verse 8 in that day shall the Lord shall
[3:32] the Lord defend the inhabitants of
[3:35] Jerusalem and he that is feeble among
[3:38] them
[3:38] shall be as David
[3:41] he that shall be feeble among them shall
[3:43] be as David and the House of David shall
[3:46] be as God as the angel of the Lord from
[3:49] before them I want to point out one
[3:50] important thing when you're reading this
[3:52] and just make sure you're right with me
[3:53] here this morning because we're going to
[3:55] go really fast through this book of
[3:57] Zechariah and teach on it just a little
[3:59] bit and I want to get to something Lord
[4:01] willing at the end before we uh before
[4:03] we conclude
[4:04] what's incredible is that God is going
[4:08] to pour out notice this here in verse 8
[4:10] let's read it again and that day shall
[4:12] the Lord defend all the inhabitants of
[4:14] Jerusalem and he that is feeble among
[4:18] them thank you shall be as David and and
[4:22] the House of David shall be his God as
[4:25] the angel of the Lord from before them
[4:27] you could imagine and I can't imagine as
[4:30] I was reading this this morning I cannot
[4:33] imagine for myself the agony or the PTSD
[4:37] that a Jew would feel when all the
[4:40] nations of the earth surround the entire
[4:43] and Encompass the entire city and now
[4:45] you have a military army United Nations
[4:48] military army a foreign army
[4:51] coming and taking them and plundering
[4:53] their city and there's the Bible speaks
[4:55] of rape and murder and it doesn't
[4:58] actually speak about a lot of death it's
[5:00] incredible I don't I don't know that the
[5:01] Bible ever mentions loss of life
[5:04] but you imagine the PTSD that's going to
[5:06] come upon the Jew who lives and it's in
[5:09] their DNA the Holocaust that they went
[5:11] through and now it looks like it's going
[5:14] to happen all over again
[5:16] let's read Zechariah Chapter 14 and
[5:18] we'll jump back so hold your Bible there
[5:20] in verse in chapter 12 and look at 14
[5:23] verse 2 for I will gather all nations
[5:25] against jacarai 14 brother Jeremiah two
[5:29] chapters over verse two for I will
[5:31] gather I'll wait for him to get that I
[5:33] want to make sure we have it Zechariah
[5:35] Chapter 14. for I will gather all
[5:38] nations this is God remember you got to
[5:41] keep this in your mind this is not a man
[5:44] this is not Biden this is not Trump this
[5:47] is not Putin
[5:50] make sure you you carefully understand
[5:52] modern events that are made clear by
[5:54] prophecy don't look at it as men doing
[5:56] this this is God doing this this is an
[5:59] anointing that comes upon people and so
[6:01] he says I will gather all nations
[6:04] against
[6:05] Jerusalem to battle and the city shall
[6:09] be taken and the house is rifled and the
[6:12] women ravished and half of the city
[6:15] shall go forth into captivity and the
[6:18] residue of the people shall not be cut
[6:20] off from the city then
[6:23] shall the Lord go forth
[6:25] and fight against those Nations so what
[6:28] is it it's a trap
[6:31] God literally brings all the nations of
[6:34] the Earth
[6:36] against her to get them to one spot so
[6:39] he can judge them
[6:42] and this time it won't be coveted this
[6:44] time it won't be a plague this time it
[6:46] won't be a disease this time it'll be
[6:48] the Lord himself Mighty in battle
[6:53] I want to make sure I'm on his side and
[6:55] not against him
[6:56] he says then the Lord shall go forth and
[6:59] fight against those Nations as when he
[7:01] fought in the day of battle and his feet
[7:04] shall stand up shall stand in that day
[7:06] upon the Mount of Olives which is before
[7:08] Jerusalem on the East let's move on down
[7:10] now turn back over to Zechariah Chapter
[7:13] 12 and let's begin reading there again
[7:15] notice in that Day verse 8 Zechariah 12
[7:18] shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of
[7:21] Jerusalem and he that is feeble among
[7:23] them shall be as David in the House of
[7:24] David shall be his God or the angel over
[7:26] for them and shall come to pass that I
[7:28] will seek notice and it shall come to
[7:30] pass in that day that I will seek to
[7:32] destroy all the nations that come
[7:35] against Jerusalem so this is the Day of
[7:39] Reckoning this is the final Day of
[7:42] Reckoning for all of the years for all
[7:44] of the Nations that came against Israel
[7:47] for all of the destruction and all of
[7:49] the all of the scheming and all of the
[7:51] planning and God says I'm going to bring
[7:53] you all to Jerusalem now what's
[7:55] incredible to me and this is just again
[7:58] me inserting my own thinking here
[8:01] it's incredible that the Bible says that
[8:03] the Lord shall defend notice verse 8 the
[8:05] inhabitants of
[8:08] say it with me
[8:10] not all Israel
[8:14] the Bible says half will be destroyed
[8:18] that's what the Bible says in so much
[8:19] that half of them
[8:21] so he says I'll defend not Israel
[8:25] remember not all Israel
[8:28] is Israel
[8:31] so there's an there's an entire family
[8:33] of God that God has
[8:35] but and God has a special love for that
[8:38] entire family the mystical Body of
[8:40] Christ but then there's a little elected
[8:43] group that has a special place and a
[8:46] special privilege and special benefits
[8:49] because they are his
[8:52] now here are a few amens the rest of you
[8:54] all believe that aren't you glad to be
[8:56] on that side
[8:58] and he says I notice this here it's only
[9:01] for Jerusalem and the House of David
[9:04] so this is a spec this is a special
[9:06] promise to a group not all but to a
[9:09] group
[9:10] are you seeing yourself
[9:12] and he says and he says here in verse
[9:14] verse 10 and I will pour
[9:17] upon the House of David and upon the
[9:20] inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit
[9:23] of Grace
[9:25] and supplications
[9:28] and they shall look upon me who they
[9:30] have pierced and they shall mourn for
[9:33] him as one mourneth for his only son and
[9:36] shall be in bitterness for him as one
[9:39] that is in bitterness for his firstborn
[9:41] I can't imagine when they realize we
[9:43] were wrong
[9:45] in that day shall there be great
[9:47] Mourning
[9:48] so you notice here the Bible says I'll
[9:51] pour out the spirit of Grace
[9:54] the spirit of grace and the spirit of
[9:56] supplications why would God if he could
[10:00] pour out any spirit that he wanted to
[10:05] but he was going to give them what they
[10:07] needed the most
[10:09] to have victory in this final day in
[10:13] this climax in this Crescendo moment
[10:16] and God says in this great final climax
[10:19] in this great Crescendo I'm going to
[10:21] give them something that they need the
[10:23] most give us the spirit of Courage know
[10:25] that he could have given them that but
[10:27] he didn't give them the spirit of War he
[10:30] could have given that but he didn't give
[10:31] him the spirit of anointing and power
[10:33] but he didn't give them that he gave him
[10:36] the greatest thing that they would need
[10:37] to get Victory and that was the spirit
[10:39] of Grace
[10:42] why Grace well let's just break down
[10:45] those two words what does grace mean you
[10:47] should know that
[10:49] it's unmerited favor
[10:52] he didn't do anything to deserve it but
[10:55] I'm going to give you Grace
[10:58] so God could have poured out any Spirit
[11:00] but these were the two things that this
[11:03] people needed more than anything they
[11:07] needed
[11:09] Grace
[11:12] now don't look so far off to Israel and
[11:14] go yeah boy that stiff-necked rebellious
[11:18] they are
[11:19] that stiff-necked rebellious hardened
[11:23] hard-headed
[11:25] people
[11:26] they need Grace you should also see
[11:29] yourself in the mirror and realize that
[11:31] what God does for Israel he also does to
[11:34] his family the elected bread that more
[11:36] than anything God could pour out would
[11:39] be rapturing
[11:40] Grace
[11:43] and so we're going to look at that here
[11:45] this morning the spirit of Grace
[11:48] and so they would need this and the
[11:51] spirit of supplications now that word
[11:54] means prayers the spirit of prayers but
[11:57] to say it more perfectly it's not just
[11:59] the spirit of prayer but it's
[12:01] desperation it's
[12:03] desperate prayer God says at that day I
[12:06] will pour out the spirit of Grace and
[12:10] desperate supplications let's keep
[12:12] reading here in verse 12. he says and I
[12:14] will pour out verse 10 of chapter 12
[12:17] Zechariah and I will pour out upon the
[12:20] House of David and upon the inhabitants
[12:23] of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and
[12:26] supplications and they shall look upon
[12:29] me whom they have pierced and they shall
[12:31] mourn for him as one mourneth for his
[12:34] only son and shall be in bitterness for
[12:36] him as one that is now it's incredible
[12:38] when you study this book of Zechariah
[12:39] and I got 10 44 so
[12:41] I don't have a lot of time let me just
[12:43] see if I want to
[12:45] go straight to the PowerPoint yes bring
[12:47] up the PowerPoint for me brother
[12:49] Jeremiah if you could it'd be great uh
[12:53] Spirit of Grace and supplications you
[12:55] can go ahead and just display that we're
[12:56] just going to read some things that
[12:57] brother Branham had to say on this here
[13:00] Spirit of Grace and supplication
[13:04] of Jesus Christ
[13:07] whatever it is maybe I can control it
[13:09] here this morning
[13:13] this is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[13:15] this Gentile message as the Jews brought
[13:19] it to the Gentiles the Gentiles will
[13:22] take it right back to the Jews again and
[13:25] the Rapture will come
[13:27] now he will pour out upon thou clip just
[13:30] a little tiny section if you go back and
[13:32] read this now he will pour out upon the
[13:36] house of Israel what
[13:39] the same Holy Spirit
[13:42] so what are the Jews going to receive
[13:44] Jerusalem had an outpouring of the Holy
[13:48] Ghost in the upper room in the book of
[13:49] Acts and they'll have it a second time
[13:51] too
[13:53] but this time it'll be to the Jews
[13:56] and he says he will pour out upon the
[13:57] house of Israel the same Holy Spirit see
[14:00] after now that's important after the
[14:03] Gentile church is gone so if you watch
[14:06] that happen you've missed it
[14:09] if you watch that spirit that Holy
[14:12] Spirit pour out upon Israel and they
[14:14] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:16] you know you've missed it notice and not
[14:18] only will it be a mournful time for the
[14:20] Jews who rejected him
[14:22] notice it's going to be we just read
[14:24] about it oh my
[14:26] boy could you imagine those Jews as they
[14:30] in their mind they begin to realize that
[14:32] was so wrong they look on him who they
[14:35] pierced well brother Branham says that's
[14:37] not the only one who's going to be who's
[14:39] going to be weeping but there's going to
[14:40] be another group who are not only
[14:42] weeping but they're gnashing their teeth
[14:45] it will be a Marvel time for the Jews as
[14:47] Messiah it will be immortal for them he
[14:49] says that not only will it be a mournful
[14:50] time for the Jews who rejected them as a
[14:52] messiah but it'll be a mournful time for
[14:54] them left Gentiles back here
[14:57] who has accepted notice who has rejected
[15:01] him as their Messiah of this day
[15:05] they'll be welling and weeping the
[15:08] sleeping virgin will be welling that's
[15:11] the church that refused to get oil in
[15:16] its light
[15:18] who is that group of people that's not a
[15:21] church that's not a church down the road
[15:23] that's not a church over here that you
[15:25] passed on your way to church this
[15:26] morning don't think like that
[15:28] that's any individual
[15:31] that refuse to get the light
[15:35] of their day
[15:37] the oil of the Holy Ghost
[15:39] into their vessel
[15:42] I read that and say Lord let me make
[15:44] sure I have the oil
[15:46] in my vessel you pray that same thing so
[15:50] I pray tonight father that you'll wake
[15:52] up somebody to the knowledge
[15:54] to know that unless they're born you say
[15:58] brother Matt what is rapturing Grace if
[16:01] God's going to pour out the spirit of
[16:02] rapture and Grace upon people then what
[16:04] is our Rapture in Grace oh that sounds
[16:06] like some Hocus Pocus God's just gonna
[16:09] poof
[16:10] and what has come to church and I'll
[16:12] have all of the my habits and I'll just
[16:14] live any old way then all of a sudden
[16:15] boom
[16:17] it's Grace no listen now now that's how
[16:19] you could think of it in your mind say
[16:21] oh Rapture and Grace I'm thankful for
[16:23] Rapture and Grace but listen to what
[16:25] brother random calls Rapture in Grace
[16:27] I pray tonight father that you wake up
[16:29] somebody to the knowledge to know that
[16:31] unless they're born again of the spirit
[16:33] of God has received and then become
[16:36] Abraham's seed that they'll never be
[16:38] able to make the rapture
[16:42] so I pray father that you'll give
[16:44] Rapture and Grace tonight
[16:46] what is your rapture in Grace it's the
[16:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[16:51] say is that all it is I don't I'm not
[16:54] professing to know I don't know
[16:57] but I know that brother Brandon says
[16:58] that you'll never make the Rapture
[17:00] without this
[17:03] listen to Jehovah Jireh now we have seen
[17:06] all kinds of great moves and shouting
[17:08] and praising God all fine now this is
[17:11] again on Rapture and Grace
[17:13] he says we've seen all kinds all kinds
[17:15] of moves and shouting and praising God
[17:17] we've spoken tongues and prophesied in
[17:20] all we've seen all of that that's fine
[17:23] now this is an important statement that
[17:26] comes right along with it
[17:29] now many people want to read this next
[17:30] quote and go see that's over here and
[17:33] then this is over here but remember how
[17:35] we preached to brother Brandon says the
[17:37] bride walks right in the middle of the
[17:38] road she doesn't leave anything off she
[17:40] doesn't cut anything out
[17:43] you don't cut one thing out to receive
[17:45] something else but God says I'm going to
[17:46] keep adding to your faith and adding to
[17:49] your virtue and adding to you doesn't
[17:51] say I'll take one remove it and I'll
[17:53] I'll give you this I'll take Faith away
[17:55] and give you knowledge and I'll take
[17:56] knowledge and give you virtue but he
[17:58] says he's going to build it it's going
[17:59] to add it's going to be a restoration
[18:01] he's going to give everything back
[18:03] the the everything of the your original
[18:05] inheritance notice what he says that
[18:07] comes right along with it but remember
[18:10] we've now remember we've had all kinds
[18:14] of moves and shouted and praising spoken
[18:16] tongues prophesied we've seen all of
[18:17] that so he's pointing to that
[18:18] Pentecostal church that restoration of
[18:21] gifts who had received all of that
[18:23] right
[18:24] and he says but remember the last thing
[18:27] is his divine presence
[18:31] the last thing is his his not the gift
[18:36] but the giver
[18:37] himself
[18:39] the last thing is his divine presence
[18:42] the word itself
[18:45] the word itself
[18:49] he is the word
[18:51] the head the word
[18:54] it's coming to the body
[18:57] now don't let that become a cliche oh
[19:00] it's the word
[19:01] what is the word it's himself
[19:04] coming to the body notice what brother
[19:07] Brandon would make this distinction
[19:09] because brother animal would say you
[19:11] can't have all the gifts and prophesying
[19:13] and speaking in tongues and then reject
[19:14] the word
[19:16] they love the Miracles that that was
[19:19] performed in brother random's Ministry
[19:20] but they rejected the word and they
[19:22] missed it all
[19:23] now notice he says but remember the last
[19:26] thing is his divine presence the head
[19:27] the word it's coming to the body now
[19:29] it's not some man here notice this quote
[19:31] it's not some man here is the messiah
[19:35] it's not some man here that's the
[19:37] Messiah it's the holy spirit is the
[19:39] Messiah Christ and the Holy Spirit is
[19:41] the same thing so here it is now just
[19:43] working in the flesh getting the body
[19:46] ready for the Rapture in Grace
[19:50] and he says this believe it friends
[19:53] Amen brother Brandon
[19:55] the working see say what does that even
[19:57] mean brother Matt so what you were
[20:00] witnessing in the ministry of God's
[20:02] Prophet was the Messiah In the Flesh
[20:07] operating in the flesh
[20:10] and what was that to do raise up a man
[20:12] and exalt him and put his put you know
[20:14] lift lift up a man was that what it was
[20:16] to do
[20:18] it was to give you Rapture and Grace
[20:22] but I pray that you'll give this is my
[20:24] favorite quote here I've got in my
[20:26] entire repertoire my my entire Arsenal I
[20:29] have
[20:30] I about went to the stratosphere when I
[20:31] read this quote but I pray this is the
[20:34] countdown 1964 but I pray
[20:36] that you'll give them such a crave for
[20:40] it Lord how many want that
[20:42] you'll give them such a crave for it
[20:45] Lord
[20:46] that they'll come and see we're at the
[20:49] end time
[20:51] the astronaut age
[20:54] not the horse and buggy
[20:58] no
[20:59] not the vehicle not the car not the
[21:02] automobile age no there was an age for
[21:05] that but we've moved past the horse and
[21:07] buggy we've moved past the the
[21:09] automobile age past the jet or does that
[21:12] the jet aircraft age we've moved past
[21:15] the jet aircraft
[21:16] now it's the astronaut age
[21:21] he says I pray that we're at the end
[21:23] time the astronaut age remember what he
[21:26] says this correlates directly with the
[21:27] quote we just read we've had all the
[21:29] gifts and signs and tongues and
[21:31] prophesied but now it's him the presence
[21:33] of him himself so does that mean now
[21:35] we've moved away from all the gifts and
[21:37] prophesied in tongues and now we have
[21:39] the word no it's all of it together
[21:42] you can't have one without the other
[21:45] and he says it's a now what is it it's
[21:47] not just the gifts and prophesying in
[21:49] tongues and healing of the body that's
[21:51] wonderful that goes with it but now
[21:53] you're going to need something greater
[21:54] than to heal your body to come up here
[21:56] in a prayer line and heal you of cancer
[21:57] if you got cancer or tuberculosis or a
[22:00] headache
[22:01] God can do all of that can you say Amen
[22:04] but you're going to need something
[22:05] greater than a power to change your
[22:07] headache you're going to need the power
[22:08] to change your body
[22:10] notice he says they'll pray that it'll
[22:13] be an Astron at the end time I pray
[22:15] father that they'll realize it isn't
[22:17] trying to condemn what they had
[22:20] it's only trying to give them more
[22:24] it's not trying to condemn what they had
[22:27] it's only trying to give them more
[22:30] I'm preaching this morning I should be
[22:32] teaching let me stay right here
[22:36] he says it's not time to condemn them
[22:38] for what they had it's to give them more
[22:41] rapturing Grace
[22:45] for the hour will come when we'll have
[22:48] to have Rapture power
[22:51] not only to heal the body but to change
[22:54] it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[22:57] Christ will be so real
[23:00] into their bodies till he can change it
[23:06] so if he's not becoming more and more
[23:09] real now how will you ever get here
[23:12] Lord make yourself more real more real
[23:15] more real
[23:16] his notice by his great death and what
[23:19] he had purchased may they take this
[23:21] today that token that the holy ghost
[23:24] that I spoke of last night hold it
[23:26] before them and walk into this astronaut
[23:29] that could be preached in a sermon
[23:31] series
[23:32] walk in this astronaut where visions
[23:36] powers and worlds Beyond known
[23:40] and oh God where all the great mysteries
[23:44] of God is unfolded in those Seven Seals
[23:46] and made known to man granite
[23:49] father
[23:51] is that your prayer
[23:55] so we're out of time this morning but I
[23:57] just want to read these last because
[23:58] notice what brother Branham says here
[23:59] about that so you say brother Matt how's
[24:01] that typing because everything what
[24:04] happens in natural Israel type spiritual
[24:06] Israel so what happens with the Jews
[24:08] happens to God's what happens to God's
[24:10] elected family to Benjamin also happens
[24:13] to the Gentile elected family of God
[24:17] so as much as the darkest hour would
[24:20] would come before day
[24:22] but as much as The Darkest Day for
[24:25] Israel
[24:26] comes before the brightest day so the
[24:29] darkest day is happening right now in
[24:32] 2022 and that's what battle you're in
[24:35] this morning
[24:37] but before the darkness notice here
[24:40] Jesus what is what is the Psalms 27 what
[24:43] does brother random use when he preaches
[24:45] the Rapture as a scripture in the day of
[24:48] trouble
[24:50] this is the Rapture song but in the day
[24:53] of trouble then I will hide him in the
[24:56] cleft of The Rock and the secret of my
[24:57] Tabernacle
[24:59] so the darkest day comes but the
[25:02] greatest day awaits
[25:04] he says here it'd be so real notice what
[25:07] he says one of these days the message
[25:08] will go to Israel and what a break for
[25:11] God will send unto them Moses and Elijah
[25:14] in Revelations 11 and they'll do signs
[25:16] and wonders and Jehovah's sign while the
[25:18] Gentiles is finished the grace day of
[25:21] Grace will leave the Gentile Church the
[25:26] Pentecostal age will leave the
[25:28] denominations will continue on because
[25:31] they come up here with the sleeping
[25:33] virgin we'll go into that just a moment
[25:36] but they'll come up in that class he's
[25:39] speaking of the foolish and the wise
[25:42] but then when they do when they do that
[25:46] the Jews will receive the baptism of the
[25:50] Holy Ghost and there will be a Revival
[25:53] there that'll stop the heavens and the
[25:55] days of don't reign
[25:57] they'll do all kinds of signs and
[26:00] miracles and finally the Roman uses
[26:02] brother random speaking of that day of
[26:04] Zechariah that we just read about in
[26:05] Zechariah 12 and 14. this is prophetic
[26:08] this is future there will come a message
[26:11] that will come the same message will go
[26:13] back to the Jews
[26:14] say what happens next this is what
[26:16] happens next
[26:17] and a Revival will break out and they'll
[26:20] do signs and miracles and wonders and
[26:22] finally the Roman hierarchy the Jews has
[26:25] the wealth of the world and so the Roman
[26:27] Catholic Church will break the cup break
[26:28] his agreement with the Jews after this
[26:31] thing is over and then the treaty that
[26:34] they got signed between them he'll go
[26:36] down there and thens when God will stand
[26:40] like he did in the old days there and
[26:43] fight for Israel
[26:45] they'll finally kill these two Prophets
[26:48] and they'll lay in the street and spit
[26:50] on them
[26:52] and when they do that that's Moses and
[26:54] Elijah and when they do that after three
[26:57] days lay in dead the spirit of life I
[27:00] love reading this so much because it's
[27:02] like I'm reading the novel at the very
[27:04] end of the book and the climax of it all
[27:06] this is what happens at the end
[27:09] and then there's the very end is and
[27:11] they lived happily ever after
[27:13] but here's what happens right before
[27:15] that
[27:16] and he says though he says when they do
[27:18] that after three days laying dead the
[27:21] spirit of life will come into those two
[27:22] prophets and they'll raise up and Ascend
[27:25] into glory and about that time the
[27:27] fireworks starts then
[27:30] about that time the fireworks starts
[27:33] that's the end time
[27:35] that's when she's over
[27:38] let's all stand to our feet I've went
[27:39] over time
[27:42] the spirit of Grace and supplication how
[27:44] many would raise a hand and say Lord I
[27:46] need it this morning Lord we do we raise
[27:48] our hands father in a body in unity Lord
[27:51] how much we need this for our daily
[27:52] lives Lord we thank you for this
[27:54] teaching this morning we pray that it
[27:56] would encourage us Lord May and break an
[27:59] enticement of our appetite Lord to read
[28:01] your word to see where we're at to see
[28:04] where we're living don't let us get so
[28:06] stuck and caught up and distracted by
[28:08] this normal life of Lord what we live
[28:11] every day is humans let us realize Lord
[28:14] that we're supernatural beings and
[28:16] there's a story that's been written
[28:18] about us and we find our part Lord bless
[28:20] the song service the worship Lord
[28:22] everything that's done today May It Be
[28:24] For Your Glory we ask it in Jesus name
[28:27] amen
[28:54] foreign
