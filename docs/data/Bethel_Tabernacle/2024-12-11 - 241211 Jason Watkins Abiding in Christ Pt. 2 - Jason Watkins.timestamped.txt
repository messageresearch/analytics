[16:08] pray
[16:11] [Music]
[16:23] amen this song U has been a real
[16:28] blessing to us and uh it was inspired by
[16:32] a statement that Charles Spurgeon made
[16:35] in a in a sermon called the happy
[16:38] Christian he was talking about trusting
[16:40] God and he said God is too wise to be
[16:44] mistaken God is too good to be unkind so
[16:48] when you don't understand and when you
[16:50] don't see his plan when you can't trace
[16:53] his hand trust his
[16:56] heart listen to the words of this song
[16:59] and I hope it'll be a blessing to you
[17:04] [Music]
[17:19] tonight all things work for are
[17:27] good though some times we
[17:30] don't see how they
[17:33] [Music]
[17:34] could struggles that break our hearts
[17:41] into sometimes blind us
[17:45] to the
[17:49] truth our father
[17:52] knows what's best for
[17:57] us his way days are not our
[18:03] own so when your pathway grows
[18:07] dim and you just don't see
[18:11] him remember you're never
[18:18] [Music]
[18:22] alone God is too wise to be mistaken
[18:31] God is too good to be
[18:37] unkind when you don't
[18:40] understand when you don't see his
[18:44] plan when you can't trace his hand trust
[18:49] his heart
[18:51] [Music]
[19:04] he sees the
[19:07] master
[19:10] plan and he holds our
[19:14] future in his
[19:18] hand so don't live as those who have no
[19:25] hope all our hope is found
[19:29] in
[19:30] [Music]
[19:33] him we see the
[19:36] Pres
[19:40] clearly but he sees the first and the
[19:46] last and like a
[19:50] tempestry he's weaving you and
[19:54] me to someday be just like like
[20:05] him God is too wise to be
[20:12] mistaken God is too C to be
[20:19] unkind when you don't
[20:23] understand when you don't see his
[20:26] plan when you can't train his hand trust
[20:31] his
[20:34] heart he alone is faithful and
[20:39] [Music]
[20:41] true he alone knows what is best for
[20:47] [Music]
[20:55] you God is too
[20:59] to be
[21:00] [Music]
[21:03] mistaken God is too good to be
[21:09] unkind when you don't
[21:13] understand when you don't see his
[21:16] plan when you can't trace his hand trust
[21:21] his
[21:23] heart when you don't
[21:27] understand when you don't see his

[36:58] amen my I had so many wonderful comments
[37:01] from the service on Sunday and I will
[37:03] just say that wow that service meant a
[37:06] lot to me this whole thought I had one
[37:10] brother particularly um dear to me a
[37:13] minister senior pastor to me a great man
[37:16] who I look up to quite a bit and uh he
[37:19] was just telling me how much he enjoyed
[37:21] it and I said well you
[37:22] know I I'm I just was so that come from
[37:27] Deep deep inside my heart for God's
[37:29] people but for me as well amen I hope
[37:32] you caught that that Sunday I was really
[37:35] pouring my own Heart Out friends and I
[37:37] just think that that that's you know
[37:40] that's the beauty of the Brotherhood of
[37:42] Christ and the saints of God and the
[37:44] camaraderie that we have and hey there's
[37:46] no big eye and little you we really are
[37:48] all in this thing together amen and so I
[37:52] just appreciate your willingness to let
[37:54] me uh open up my heart like that and I
[37:57] want to continue on tonight there's
[37:58] still quite a bit I want to say and
[38:01] we'll just go so far tonight and we'll
[38:03] just uh stop right there at a certain
[38:07] point couple of things that as we were
[38:09] closing out on
[38:12] Sunday we were making some of the
[38:15] comments about how that there was such a
[38:18] need in this hour for True Vine Jesus
[38:21] said I'm the True Vine and my goodness
[38:24] did we ever find out how much we needed
[38:26] there to be a true vine
[38:28] there is such a an impersonation of
[38:30] Christianity in this hour and Satan has
[38:33] become such a master more more than any
[38:36] other age it's
[38:38] unparalleled in history un unprecedented
[38:41] we're facing unprecedented times that
[38:45] that God's family has never faced before
[38:48] and uh but but we but we do know that
[38:52] that that the Lord is mindful of the
[38:55] things that we are facing and long
[38:58] before we ever got here he he had a plan
[39:01] and really when it comes down to it
[39:04] tonight if I could really get you to
[39:06] absorb this thought that that is that is
[39:10] really the heart of this matter is that
[39:13] Jesus gave us the solution to survive
[39:17] the
[39:17] impossible and not just to survive but
[39:20] could I say to
[39:23] thrive and so I realize that we are
[39:25] striving I I understand that and there's
[39:28] a reward to those at the end time
[39:31] brother Brenham contrast our age to the
[39:33] age of the martyrs and how that they
[39:35] will have a reward in that they have
[39:38] given meaning that they gave their lives
[39:40] but they didn't face uh you know they
[39:43] they face things that we don't face as
[39:45] far as none of us are called to go to
[39:47] the Lion's Den but we Face such an
[39:50] impossible Darkness how that we are
[39:52] going to survive as I said to you on
[39:55] Sunday uh we're we're living at a time
[39:58] that was impenetrable even to a prophet
[40:01] couldn't even see and thought my nobody
[40:04] could survive that one they asked him
[40:06] the reporter there in South Africa and
[40:08] ask him why did you pick 1977 he said
[40:11] because it got so dark at that point I
[40:13] thought nobody can survive it you're
[40:15] living in the time of that where it's
[40:18] unsurvivable it's in the time of a of a
[40:20] Darkness impenetrable you're going to
[40:23] have to have the mind of Christ seeing
[40:26] for you you thinking for you moving for
[40:29] you or you're not going to survive it
[40:33] friends not talking about losing your
[40:36] salvation I think we made the case
[40:38] Sunday that's quite impossible and we're
[40:41] we're we're showing here the the side
[40:43] that Jesus is speaking to we know it has
[40:46] a compound meaning but our aim is to
[40:49] speak to those who have passed from
[40:50] Death under life but Jesus is saying to
[40:53] you if you want to bring forth fruit
[40:56] you're going to have to come God's word
[40:59] way and his word way is the mind of
[41:04] Christ uh there there's such such
[41:06] similarities there in in in the in what
[41:10] we see today where Satan would was was
[41:13] it was prophesied to us that he would be
[41:16] so deceptive that the similarities could
[41:18] be so close as to become uh you know you
[41:22] can't disentangle I I don't want to dare
[41:25] get into my part three um although I can
[41:29] feel myself trying to be drawn in that
[41:31] direction but let me just say friends
[41:34] that we're living in a in an age where
[41:36] there's such a a a a mingling such an
[41:39] amalgamation of light and darkness such
[41:43] a such a mixture of of what is perfectly
[41:47] good and what looks like really good and
[41:50] it's only one% not good and it's and
[41:53] it's
[41:54] death we're living in a time this is a a
[41:57] serious hour where when brother brandham
[42:00] saw the he he saw the Mamba there you
[42:02] remember he's coming he's walking on a
[42:04] map to palestin he's two-thirds of the
[42:06] way to crossing over and and and there
[42:09] was a great fear among all the people
[42:11] and he said I heard it crashing through
[42:14] you know the the the coming through the
[42:16] bush and he said it came out on the road
[42:18] and he said as soon as I saw it I knew
[42:20] it was a large Mamba one bite you're
[42:22] done if it and he said there was a
[42:24] brother with me and he said it went
[42:26] after him and I'm here to tell you
[42:28] something friends this is Brother Jason
[42:30] I just believe that that brother
[42:31] represented me and it represented you
[42:33] and brother brandham said he was jumping
[42:35] and spinning and jumping back and trying
[42:37] and sometimes that's how we feel in life
[42:39] I'm just constantly jumping around
[42:41] trying to avoid the devil trying to
[42:43] avoid the world and and brother brandom
[42:45] screamed out oh if it ever hits him he
[42:47] it'll kill him and and and and and and
[42:49] he he called on the name of the Lord and
[42:52] the Lord came down and what was the
[42:54] answer you got to be more sincere you
[42:58] won't survive that Mambo will take you
[43:00] out you might not lose your Eternal
[43:02] destination but everything you've tried
[43:04] to strive for can be lost and I don't
[43:07] want to lose I want to
[43:11] win it's not the hour to quit now it's
[43:14] not the hour to get lazy now this is the
[43:17] time to press the
[43:22] battle oh how we needed a True Vine
[43:28] I gave you how Sunday where brother
[43:30] brandham gave us the plan of God that he
[43:33] had a three-fold
[43:35] plan and the whole thing was to bring
[43:38] the kingdom back to its rightly position
[43:40] we're not going to go back through all
[43:41] of that again just remember that the
[43:44] plan at the end time that that phase two
[43:47] was for God to get complete control of
[43:49] his church and we know of course and I
[43:52] don't have time to teach on it tonight
[43:54] maybe when I've got more time but
[43:56] clearly we can see that God is in
[43:59] complete control of his church in the in
[44:04] the alpha age and again in the Omega age
[44:07] we know that in the ages in between it
[44:10] was what brother brandham called an ad
[44:12] mixture of God's word mixed with a
[44:15] mizing of the word of God and it and it
[44:17] produced a hybrid now thank God Christ
[44:20] was back in the eternity's interceding
[44:22] on behalf of his family see and so but
[44:26] we realize that he comes forward to
[44:28] claim the book and we're not here to
[44:31] linger on in a half truth or almost all
[44:34] the truth I want the full unadulterated
[44:37] word of God
[44:40] only and we have it and it's here and
[44:43] it's powerful and you can access it and
[44:46] you can use it and it's for
[44:48] you and you're going to find it's
[44:51] actually part of
[44:55] you which is why you have have access to
[45:00] it abide in me you know Jesus wasn't
[45:04] saying and I may be getting a we bit
[45:06] ahead of myself but I'm just going to
[45:08] have to go as I feel in my heart Jesus
[45:12] was not you know suggesting
[45:15] that when when he's talking about you
[45:17] know a abide in me because without me he
[45:20] goes on down without me you can do
[45:22] nothing amen now he wasn't saying that
[45:25] you won't accomplish things right he
[45:28] just simply he was just simply saying
[45:29] they'll equal nothing without me you
[45:33] might accomplish all kinds of things you
[45:36] might become the king of the world you
[45:38] might Ascend to a station in life you
[45:41] might set records you might become
[45:43] famous you might you might do all kinds
[45:46] of
[45:48] extraordinary which is which you know is
[45:52] extraordinary you might do all kinds of
[45:54] extraordinary things and accomplish
[45:57] extraordinary things for the world for
[46:00] yourself for your whatever for your
[46:02] family for your children for your own
[46:04] life for the for the uh the economy for
[46:07] the community but Jesus is simply saying
[46:10] listen it's all going to Ash and sinder
[46:13] the only things that will survive is
[46:16] eternal things and that has to come
[46:18] through
[46:18] me so it so so it comes back to the
[46:21] question of what are you
[46:24] chasing what are what is the priority
[46:26] priorities of your life what are your
[46:29] priorities dad for your for you and your
[46:31] home and your family and your children
[46:33] and your
[46:36] Offspring you'd be amazed
[46:39] how how much your life demonstrates what
[46:42] your priorities are you think nobody
[46:44] sees it they see
[46:47] it it doesn't matter that they see it or
[46:50] that I see it I preach I I I'm going to
[46:52] preach what I preach
[46:54] regardless and you know you might this
[46:57] whole church might allow God to purge so
[47:01] that they can bring forth more and then
[47:02] when you as I've said before you think
[47:05] well okay finally I I now I've brought
[47:07] forth more now that I get now I where I
[47:09] get to go to Disney World the Lord's
[47:11] going to let give me a big all expense
[47:13] paid and the answer is no actually I'm
[47:15] going to purge you again so you bring
[47:16] forth even
[47:18] more and you might accomplish that and
[47:20] we might accomplish that as a church
[47:22] that be the Delight of me as your pastor
[47:24] but I'm still going to preach that you
[47:26] need to keep pressing I'm still going to
[47:28] preach you can't rest you can't hold
[47:30] back you still got to go forward cuz we
[47:33] still ain't out of
[47:38] here so Jesus said abide in
[47:43] me I think Andrew Murray says it best
[47:46] when he made this statement this message
[47:50] abide in
[47:51] me is especially for those who have
[47:54] heard the gentle call coming unto me the
[47:58] Lord now extends a deeper
[48:02] invitation abide in
[48:05] me we're here we're Christians we're
[48:07] Believers because we heard come unto me
[48:10] and we did we came to the word we came
[48:14] to the son of man we have received
[48:17] eternal life but now do you hear the the
[48:20] the deeper call do you hear the the
[48:23] deeper Challenge from the Lord don't I'm
[48:26] glad you come to me but now I need you
[48:28] to abide in me as I said to you Sunday
[48:33] Calvary wasn't the end Calvary was the
[48:35] beginning for you that's where we begin
[48:38] now we're moving forward and under the
[48:41] grace and under the guidance of the Holy
[48:43] Spirit see so so so the new birth then
[48:47] of course we you know we we've taught it
[48:49] many times the new birth must be in
[48:52] place um can I just say it like this the
[48:55] new birth must be in place our
[48:58] navigation in this darkness is
[49:02] impossible not saying you won't make
[49:04] tracks and go forward but you're not
[49:06] going to navigate it according to the
[49:07] word of God and if you don't navigate
[49:09] according to the word of God you don't
[49:11] you don't get the reward of the word of
[49:13] God
[49:18] Amen so we know that brother Brandon in
[49:22] defining the new birth said it's a
[49:24] revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:27] who is the word this is from Christ is
[49:29] the mystery of God revealed it is the
[49:31] Revelation what is the new birth brother
[49:34] bandam it is the revelation of Jesus
[49:36] Christ who is the word personally to you
[49:40] see so it's the word of course we've
[49:43] taught on this before the word is is
[49:45] logos logos means the established word
[49:49] it's the unchanging inherent word but
[49:52] but then then what is Rema Rema is the
[49:55] Living Word when you have believed the
[49:58] established word then your life becomes
[50:01] not just the established word
[50:04] doctrinally but it becomes the Rema of
[50:06] the word alive and you're living
[50:11] according to the established word it's
[50:14] not a different word or a second word
[50:16] it's a furtherance it's what God is
[50:18] doing to you in the New Birth the new
[50:20] birth brings your life into Rema your
[50:22] life then becomes a living a living
[50:26] testimony to the logos which is the
[50:28] established
[50:30] word it's not hard to
[50:34] understand so it's
[50:36] personally to you the word is made
[50:39] personally the revelation of it there's
[50:41] an there's an amen in the voice of your
[50:44] life and you know why that you can have
[50:48] an amen to the voice of the word because
[50:51] the gene of God that is in you is the
[50:55] word it's just another form of the
[50:59] logos and when the Holy Spirit comes and
[51:02] annihilates your old nature and the life
[51:04] of that Gene comes to life that's
[51:07] Rema see that's what devils are afraid
[51:12] of there's an amen in the voice of your
[51:15] life because the gene is now perpetually
[51:19] perpetually REM it's a Living Word it's
[51:22] brought to life by an experience of the
[51:24] Holy Ghost and no other way can't end
[51:26] around that you can't join a church you
[51:28] can't just believe God sent a prophet
[51:30] you can't just come in on Mom and Dad's
[51:32] experience you've got to have your own
[51:35] personal fire breathing experience of
[51:39] the Holy Ghost eternal life then of
[51:42] course is within you and and you know
[51:46] don't let it just become a
[51:48] cliche it's not just a the new birth
[51:51] that's not just a cliche born again it's
[51:53] not just a saying you understand that
[51:56] the new birth changes a part of you
[52:00] there's a Third Realm you're a Triune
[52:03] being Body Spirit and soul that new
[52:05] birth transforms your nature and it's
[52:09] now the life of God it's the mind of
[52:12] Christ and how do I get it stronger by
[52:14] daily surrendering and surrendering and
[52:16] surrendering it's eternal life within
[52:19] you bringing the rest of your body to a
[52:23] body
[52:25] change amen
[52:27] I want to get the rest of me hallelujah
[52:30] hallelujah I'm glad for what's happened
[52:31] in my soul but I want to get the rest of
[52:33] me somay and not just in a Rapture I
[52:37] want the I want I want the me that's
[52:39] still here to be under the power of the
[52:43] Holy

[52:49] right here right now the one that has to
[52:51] face the world every day I want that
[52:54] Living Word of this hour living in that
[52:56] man
[52:59] Hallelujah so
[53:01] now we come to
[53:05] abiding you get
[53:07] me so now we come to
[53:11] abiding that's what abiding is about
[53:13] it's what it's for not just abiding as a
[53:17] cliche but there's a
[53:19] fervency I want to challenge you tonight
[53:23] to be fervent in your faith God is Not
[53:27] Looking for lukewarmness he'd rather you
[53:29] be cold than lukewarm he's looking for
[53:32] the Zeal of the Holy Ghost he's looking
[53:34] for fervency in our lives a total
[53:38] surrender the abiding of Christ The
[53:40] Living
[53:41] Union with him this is an experience of
[53:44] his daily presence his his hourly
[53:46] presence not only his presence but his
[53:49] keeping thank God I believe he has a
[53:51] keeping power that can live in our lives
[53:54] in this wicked adulterous gener
[53:58] generation and I want that I want to see
[54:01] consistent manifestation of his life in
[54:03] control of my
[54:04] life how about you bethle Tabernacle I

[54:15] fruit bearing and all the blessedness
[54:18] and all the sacredness that Jesus
[54:21] connected to abiding
[54:28] because he connected
[54:30] it say I want
[54:33] Power he connected it to
[54:35] abiding I want
[54:38] joy I want
[54:40] blessedness amen
[54:43] see so I I want fruit bearing how many
[54:46] want fruit bearing he connected it to
[54:51] abiding not just your new birth but
[54:54] abiding in Christ
[54:56] daily
[55:01] hourly um hey who's back there Josh
[55:04] let's I'm give you a workout give me
[55:06] Luke
[55:07] nine I want to go through a number of
[55:11] verses so you just keep your trigger
[55:13] finger ready brother Josh and I'll go
[55:16] slow and then sometimes I'll go fast and
[55:19] Luke
[55:22] 923 all right Le let's let's let's um
[55:26] let's um stir us up by way of
[55:31] remembrance all right I'm going to give
[55:33] you some abiding
[55:37] qualifiers Luke 9:23 he said to them
[55:42] all if any man will come after me let
[55:47] him read it with me deny
[55:51] himself take up his cross yearly
[55:58] did I read it wrong y'all didn't agree
[56:01] to a wrong reading did you let him take
[56:04] up his cross
[56:05] daily and follow
[56:09] me see so so self-denial is a Daily
[56:15] Commitment say I want to abide great
[56:18] it's a Daily
[56:19] Commitment to follow
[56:22] Christ is
[56:24] symbolized by taking up your cross see
[56:31] representing a full surrender and
[56:37] unwavering loyalty that's what Jesus was
[56:41] showing when he took up his cross he was
[56:44] showing unyielding unbending undying
[56:49] loyalty unwavering loyalty total
[56:52] complete full surrender to the will of
[56:55] the father and now he turns around to
[56:58] his church and he says as the father's
[57:00] in me and I in him now you be in me and
[57:02] I'll be in
[57:03] you how are you going to abide say

[57:08] abiding oh my goodness tell me how to
[57:09] get
[57:11] it there you
[57:14] go Matthew chapter 6 brother the
[57:19] Josh Matthew chapter
[57:21] 6 verse 24
[57:28] no
[57:29] man can serve two
[57:32] masters so I think it's pretty clear who
[57:35] the two masters are Christ or Antichrist
[57:38] God or the devil good or bad light or
[57:41] Darkness right no one can serve two
[57:44] masters either you will hate the one and
[57:46] love the other or you will be devoted to
[57:49] the one and despise the other you cannot
[57:52] serve both God and money amen
[57:57] now I'm going to tell you a
[58:01] story you can take it down just for a
[58:04] minute brother Josh I'll I'll get you in
[58:06] a second we'll go to another
[58:09] one when Israel came out of the Exodus
[58:13] and they wandered in the wilderness all
[58:16] those years and you know the whole story
[58:18] I'm not going to rehearse it to you
[58:19] learned it since Sunday school you know
[58:21] what happened at kades Barne and then
[58:22] they wandered and then they came back
[58:24] under Joshua and and we find out that
[58:27] when it got time to cross over Joshua
[58:30] had to make good on a promise Moses had
[58:33] made to two and a half
[58:36] tribes Gad and reuben reuben and Gad and
[58:40] later on finally even half the tribe of
[58:44] Manasseh said you know we'll just stay
[58:46] on the east side of the river y'all can
[58:49] just cross on over into the promised
[58:52] land we'll just stay right here
[58:56] and it's incredible
[58:59] because that that when you really
[59:01] realize what they're saying is that they
[59:03] didn't want to
[59:04] occupy all that the Lord had promised
[59:10] them and and to them coming out of Egypt
[59:14] was
[59:17] enough I came out of
[59:20] Egypt I'm born again I received the word
[59:23] of this hour I say Amen to every word
[59:25] but you know I I don't I just don't need
[59:28] to press on into all that stuff y'all
[59:33] carry on you know we'll we'll pray for
[59:37] you I we'll even come over and help you
[59:38] fight and help you settle it but I don't
[59:40] want to I don't want to deal with having
[59:42] to get all the promises in the word
[59:44] applied to my
[59:48] life it's interesting because when they
[59:51] said to Moses and I'm not going to go
[59:53] back into the Old Testament to read it
[59:54] tonight I'm just telling you the story
[59:56] you can go read it
[59:58] yourself their heart was made clear when
[1:00:01] they said to Moses Moses said why do you
[1:00:03] want to stay over here and they said
[1:00:06] well we you know what here here's the
[1:00:09] reason Moses we want to it's better over
[1:00:12] here for our livestock We Can Make a
[1:00:15] Better Living uh it'll be a little
[1:00:18] easier on us because we're herdsmen and
[1:00:21] we can build houses and barns for our
[1:00:24] animals
[1:00:27] and our
[1:00:28] children so even their their livelihood
[1:00:34] in their mind was a higher priority than
[1:00:38] their children because they actually put
[1:00:40] it their animals I'm I'm worried about
[1:00:43] my animals you know you got kids yeah
[1:00:45] them
[1:00:46] [Laughter]
[1:00:53] too now Moses turned it around on him
[1:00:56] because the word always corrects the
[1:00:57] error when Moses said back okay here's
[1:01:00] what I'll do but you're going to have to
[1:01:01] go help help your brothers you're going
[1:01:02] have to cross over and help them fight
[1:01:04] and then you can come back and build
[1:01:05] your houses and when you build them let
[1:01:07] the word correct the error they're going
[1:01:09] to be built for your children then your
[1:01:12] animals don't be putting your livestock
[1:01:17] don't be putting your livelihood don't
[1:01:19] be putting your money don't be putting
[1:01:22] your business don't be putting your
[1:01:24] career like the world does ahead of
[1:01:28] raising your children in the admonition
[1:01:31] of
[1:01:32] God if you're going to stay over here
[1:01:35] and you're not going to take the
[1:01:36] promised land that God has promised to
[1:01:38] help you with all right you've came out
[1:01:41] of Egypt fine you're Reuben you're Gad
[1:01:44] you're half the tribe of Manasseh you're
[1:01:46] you're you're you're in God's word and
[1:01:48] you don't you don't want to press over
[1:01:49] all right I'll make that deal but if
[1:01:51] you're gonna stay over here understand
[1:01:54] nothing comes ahead of demonstrating the
[1:01:57] token to your
[1:02:00] family and I have seen too many families
[1:02:05] and too many children who grew into
[1:02:08] teenagers and they weren't that sweet
[1:02:10] little child anymore and as soon as they
[1:02:12] grew into teenagers into the world they
[1:02:15] went because no one ever brought them
[1:02:17] daily into contact with the Holy
[1:02:21] Ghost now you can do every bit of that
[1:02:23] or they can still go that way I
[1:02:25] understand that look Adam and Eve had
[1:02:27] the best parent in the world God they
[1:02:30] lived in a perfect a perfect home the
[1:02:32] garden and they still fell it can happen
[1:02:35] I'm not here to brow beat anybody that
[1:02:38] can happen but I can tell you as a
[1:02:39] parent and as a grandparent there's no
[1:02:41] Agony worse than seeing your family
[1:02:43] struggle because you know you did not
[1:02:46] establish the token in prayer and an
[1:02:48] altar and and bring your children daily
[1:02:51] like you should have there's no pain
[1:02:53] like that amen amen
[1:02:57] and conversely there's no joy even when
[1:03:00] you know you didn't do that to see God
[1:03:02] come down in his Mercy
[1:03:03] anyway and rescue them oh we got some in
[1:03:07] here tonight we didn't always get it
[1:03:09] right did we but God is rich in Mercy
[1:03:16] Hallelujah see so they were even joined
[1:03:19] by the half tribe of of manasse and and
[1:03:23] the same thing Manasseh that was what
[1:03:26] they said it's more suitable for our
[1:03:28] livestock so
[1:03:31] they let me just try to make it
[1:03:33] applicable so
[1:03:36] they they they agreed they chose to help
[1:03:39] the rest of the
[1:03:41] church take up their fight for the
[1:03:44] promised land um so they were a benefit
[1:03:47] to the kingdom right sure but Reuben Gad
[1:03:51] and half the tribe of Manasseh placed
[1:03:55] their own
[1:03:56] Pursuits of
[1:03:58] wealth and
[1:04:00] ease above occupying God's promised word
[1:04:07] amen I can't say it pler I'll let the
[1:04:10] Holy Spirit make it to make it real to
[1:04:13] you to whoever's listening
[1:04:15] tonight they were in and the and the sad
[1:04:18] part is that they were entitled to go
[1:04:23] there they had waited for 00
[1:04:27] years they had been in slavery and after
[1:04:29] all that sweating it out for
[1:04:32] 430 years and they finally and God would
[1:04:36] have helped them he would have helped
[1:04:39] them he said you'll go over there you
[1:04:41] won't even lose a man and they didn't
[1:04:43] want that
[1:04:45] fight so they just stayed back on the
[1:04:47] east side you know what
[1:04:49] happened when the Assyrians came in and
[1:04:53] took the northern 10 tribes of of Israel
[1:04:56] from Samaria do you know that they had
[1:04:59] come a decade sooner and took Gad
[1:05:02] Manasseh half tribe of Manasseh and
[1:05:04] reuben reuben Gad and Hal tribe of
[1:05:07] Manasseh went into slavery 10
[1:05:11] years ahead of Israel and
[1:05:15] Samaria and then as as far as it relates
[1:05:18] to Jerusalem and Judah and the City of
[1:05:21] David that that they were taken 146
[1:05:25] years
[1:05:26] years before the third wave of the
[1:05:29] Babylonians came through and sacked
[1:05:30] Jerusalem for the third time and burnt
[1:05:33] the temple and took all the people the
[1:05:34] first time they came they took Daniel
[1:05:36] then they then they came again because
[1:05:37] of a rebellion and then they came a
[1:05:39] third I think the second time they took
[1:05:41] hezekia and he got taken and then the
[1:05:43] next time the third time they said okay
[1:05:45] we're done with you rebellious Jews
[1:05:47] we're just going to sack the city raise
[1:05:49] it all to the ground and burn the temple
[1:05:51] and you're done you're going into
[1:05:53] captivity and Israel ceased at at being
[1:05:55] in nation and and and we find that it
[1:05:58] took it took 70
[1:06:01] years before they could ever get
[1:06:04] back and I can't keep going in that
[1:06:07] because that breaks into other things
[1:06:08] and I've I've got it for
[1:06:13] later but do you
[1:06:16] see
[1:06:17] parents here and listening
[1:06:21] online do you see the impossibility of
[1:06:25] div Ed
[1:06:27] loyalties do you see why Jesus said you
[1:06:30] cannot serve God in
[1:06:32] Mamon you can't you'll you'll you'll
[1:06:35] give all your attention to the one and
[1:06:38] despise the other
[1:06:41] one call that that that Jesus was
[1:06:44] calling in our in our verse that we read
[1:06:48] he says no man can serve to Masters put
[1:06:51] it back up for me uh U brother Josh
[1:06:54] Matthew 6:24 no man no one can serve two
[1:06:57] masters either he'll he will hate the
[1:07:00] one and love the other or you will be
[1:07:02] devoted to the one and despise the other
[1:07:04] you cannot serve God in
[1:07:07] money it calls for exclusive here's what
[1:07:11] Jesus is meaning and abiding in me
[1:07:15] abiding we're not talking about just
[1:07:17] being born again we're talking about
[1:07:20] Abiding and abiding calls for an
[1:07:23] exclusive Devotion to to him above all
[1:07:28] worldly attachments full stop
[1:07:34] amen Galatians 2:20 brother
[1:07:37] Josh there's another abiding scripture
[1:07:41] Paul says Galatians
[1:07:43] 2:20 I have been crucified with
[1:07:47] Christ and I no I'll wait for you
[1:07:50] brother Josh Galatians
[1:07:53] 2:20 all right I have been Cru I am
[1:07:57] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:08:00] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:08:05] and the life which I now live in the
[1:08:08] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:08:12] God not faith in the Son of God which
[1:08:17] led him to a new birth but now he's
[1:08:20] Abiding and he has the faith of the Son
[1:08:23] of God who loved me and and gave himself
[1:08:26] for me then how can I not give myself
[1:08:29] for him see so it requires complete
[1:08:35] allegiance to Christ as dying to self to
[1:08:40] where you are living this is abiding
[1:08:42] abiding is living entirely through faith
[1:08:46] and and Christ's indwelling presence
[1:08:50] pleased to dwell in you pleased to lead
[1:08:54] you pleased to be around you not
[1:08:59] grieved Romans 12 I know you're probably
[1:09:02] about to collapse under all these but
[1:09:04] let me keep going can you take it can
[1:09:07] you take the apostles words do you know
[1:09:10] Paul loved
[1:09:12] you Romans 121
[1:09:17] therefore I urge you Brothers I beseech
[1:09:20] you therefore
[1:09:21] Brethren by the mercies of God that ye
[1:09:26] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[1:09:29] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:09:32] reasonable service I urge you this is
[1:09:36] Paul's heart pouring out I urge you
[1:09:39] Jesus wants you to abide there's there's
[1:09:42] there's many things in the promised land
[1:09:44] that you are entitled to and you don't
[1:09:47] have to live like a popper and you don't
[1:09:49] have to get beat down by the devil and
[1:09:51] you don't have to get drugg around by
[1:09:53] your the your flesh and your senses you
[1:09:56] can have Victory friends it's to you
[1:09:59] it's for you Christ died so you could
[1:10:02] have
[1:10:05] it this verse calls Believers to
[1:10:08] dedicate their entire lives to Christ as
[1:10:11] a Living Sacrifice you know why because
[1:10:14] when you dedicate your life to Christ as
[1:10:17] a Living Sacrifice then your life
[1:10:20] reflects a continual worship amen you
[1:10:24] you didn't when you come into church and
[1:10:27] start singing songs and worship you're
[1:10:28] just extending what you've been doing
[1:10:30] all
[1:10:31] week just your everyday walking talking
[1:10:35] life is a Perpetual continual flame
[1:10:38] before God it's a constant sacrifice
[1:10:41] it's why the Bible says give him the
[1:10:43] sacrifice of your praise your life I I
[1:10:46] can't say it any plainer than this your
[1:10:49] life is a living
[1:10:54] worship that's
[1:10:56] abiding let me give you another one
[1:10:58] Colossians 3 brother Josh Colossians
[1:11:02] 3 uh let's go to
[1:11:05] 17 you good breathe just breathe you'll
[1:11:09] be all
[1:11:11] right whatever you
[1:11:14] do Colossians
[1:11:17] 3:17 we'll get there in a
[1:11:21] second Colossians 3:17 and whatever you
[1:11:24] do
[1:11:26] whatsoever you do you do in word or deed
[1:11:31] whatever you do whether it's in word or
[1:11:34] whether it's in deed do all in the name
[1:11:39] of the Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks
[1:11:42] to God and the father by him no matter
[1:11:44] what it is in word or deed do it all in
[1:11:48] the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks
[1:11:50] to God and the father through Christ see
[1:11:54] so oh Paul is emphasizing that every
[1:11:58] action and every word should be done for
[1:12:02] the glory of Christ amen every action
[1:12:06] every word I'm here to tell you
[1:12:08] something friends you have less than no
[1:12:11] chance to pull this off outside of a
[1:12:14] holy ghost New Birth and you then you've
[1:12:17] got at least a chance but it's going to
[1:12:19] require a willingness to abide in Christ
[1:12:23] this isn't come unto me
[1:12:25] first of all Jesus said come unto me
[1:12:28] that's to the whole world all ye that
[1:12:29] are weary and heavy laden I'll give you
[1:12:31] rest he said if I be lifted up I will
[1:12:34] draw all men see so so the whole world
[1:12:37] Jesus died for the sins of the whole
[1:12:40] world so so come unto me is to everybody
[1:12:44] but abide in me that's for an elect lady
[1:12:48] those who know him in the power and his
[1:12:51] resurrection who are willing to give up
[1:12:53] their lives and give up Pursuits and let
[1:12:56] Christ take over their life and mind in
[1:13:00] all things word or deed the very action
[1:13:03] and word should be done for Christ make
[1:13:05] up your mind tonight let me say it that
[1:13:07] way make up your mind tonight make up
[1:13:10] your mind in this service that there's
[1:13:13] no and there's no way to get around it
[1:13:15] I'm here to tell you that God is calling
[1:13:18] for men and women to step up and be and
[1:13:21] be ambassadors of the word of God
[1:13:25] there's no way to get around the call of
[1:13:27] the Lord upon his family for total
[1:13:31] Allegiance in all aspects of Our Lives
[1:13:34] this you have to understand all right
[1:13:36] take that down for now brother Josh and
[1:13:38] I'll I'll have you get another one here
[1:13:39] in just in a minute or no I probably
[1:13:41] won't I'll just because they're familiar
[1:13:43] and I'll just slow me down just a little
[1:13:46] bit you still
[1:13:50] good you understand
[1:13:53] that and I have have to be careful how I
[1:13:55] explain
[1:13:57] this but I can demonstrate what I'm
[1:13:59] going to say but and let me just say it
[1:14:01] like this the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:14:03] in the
[1:14:04] word um who who was always the word he
[1:14:08] didn't become it he always was that see
[1:14:11] so that that Revelation came on Old
[1:14:14] Testament Saints too I mean how do you
[1:14:17] think Abel knew what to offer how do you
[1:14:20] think Enoch knew how to build how do you
[1:14:22] think Noah knew how to build see how do
[1:14:25] you think how do you think David how do
[1:14:27] you think Solomon figured out how to do
[1:14:29] it David knew how to get all the the the
[1:14:32] right supplies Moses knew that what he
[1:14:34] should do because the the word could be
[1:14:37] revealed for what what couldn't in fact
[1:14:41] is it was it was so powerful that even
[1:14:44] at times they had to put a a veil over
[1:14:46] the face of Moses and the Bible called
[1:14:49] him a God to the people Bible at another
[1:14:52] place called him a king he was a king in
[1:14:54] just sure
[1:14:56] and and so we realize that God could
[1:14:58] come on Daniel and could come on Ezekiel
[1:15:01] he could come on Solomon he could come
[1:15:02] on David he could come on Enoch and Noah
[1:15:05] and Abraham what he could not do that he
[1:15:09] can now do is abide inside of them and
[1:15:13] remain there he can abide with you he
[1:15:16] can abide in you are you willing to
[1:15:20] abide in
[1:15:21] him you have a privilege they didn't
[1:15:24] have
[1:15:26] see so so it it remains now and it lives
[1:15:30] on the
[1:15:31] inside of you and I and and and of
[1:15:34] course and and of course you know not
[1:15:36] only that but I mean it it can come on
[1:15:39] people inspiration of the word God can
[1:15:41] reveal the word to people who aren't
[1:15:43] even born again yet that's how he gets
[1:15:45] you to a born again State he reveals the
[1:15:46] word and you start following it amen he
[1:15:49] went into Matthew 16 here's where we
[1:15:51] won't I won't put it on the screen but
[1:15:53] he went to Peter
[1:15:55] who do men say that I am Peter's not
[1:15:57] born again Peter don't have the Holy
[1:15:58] Ghost yet the Holy Ghost hadn't yet been
[1:15:59] given but he said who who do they say
[1:16:02] well you're this that or the other who
[1:16:04] do you say you're the Christ the son of
[1:16:05] the Living God Jesus testified no one
[1:16:08] told you that my heavenly father told
[1:16:10] you that you see so so so so we find out
[1:16:16] that that that that it came to the woman
[1:16:18] at the well in John 4 the the the
[1:16:21] scripture that probably I would say you
[1:16:25] know off top of my head probably other
[1:16:27] than maybe Hebrews
[1:16:28] 138 um maybe John 1 and one John 4 the
[1:16:34] woman at the well brother Brandon went
[1:16:36] to that over and over and over again he
[1:16:40] peep catch people in the prayer line and
[1:16:42] say now here we have a scene exactly
[1:16:45] like John for here's a man here's a
[1:16:47] woman they don't know each other and he
[1:16:49] said but Jesus started talking to her
[1:16:51] contacting her spirit amen and here's
[1:16:54] she is she's not the Holy Ghost isn't
[1:16:56] yet given but yet I love it because
[1:16:59] brother Brandon talks about her harlotry
[1:17:02] and how that and this is not a direct
[1:17:04] quote I don't have it in front of me but
[1:17:06] the point he's making and and he says to
[1:17:08] this to this exact effect yes her body
[1:17:11] had long been polluted but her soul was
[1:17:14] still virgin Hallelujah nothing had ever
[1:17:18] reached down to that Gene of God it had
[1:17:20] been laying there her whole
[1:17:23] life and Jesus revealed himself to
[1:17:27] her now it's interesting because two
[1:17:30] things happened in Rapid
[1:17:33] succession the Bible says in in St John
[1:17:37] 4:26 Jesus said unto her I that speak
[1:17:41] unto thee am he verse 27 says and upon
[1:17:47] this he said I that speak to thee am he
[1:17:52] and upon this and when when once you
[1:17:55] read upon this two things happened right
[1:17:58] together I'm here to tell you something
[1:18:00] friends she the first thing that
[1:18:02] happened is she threw down her water
[1:18:05] pots she didn't need the world anymore
[1:18:08] she didn't care about none of that stuff
[1:18:10] she was and and you know something else
[1:18:12] the disciples came up and the Bible says
[1:18:15] none of them dared ask none of them
[1:18:17] dared speak and I'm here to tell you
[1:18:19] when Christ comes to you and you don't
[1:18:21] hear nothing else there's no other
[1:18:23] voices talking if just you and him I
[1:18:26] remember that day do you remember that
[1:18:29] day she threw down her water pot she
[1:18:31] didn't need that kind of stuff anymore
[1:18:33] and she was she was such a Believer even
[1:18:36] before the Holy Ghost could live in her
[1:18:38] daily that she ran into the city doesn't
[1:18:41] even say a village she ran into the City

[1:19:14] Christ that's how I
[1:19:16] was I only wanted to hear his mind and
[1:19:20] his mind only Jesus only
[1:19:25] I didn't I didn't care anymore about the
[1:19:27] siren song of the world I didn't want to
[1:19:29] follow that my flesh still battles me
[1:19:33] that's why I abide in
[1:19:35] him that's why I found my
[1:19:40] strength it's the life of the
[1:19:44] word upon the gene of God in your soul
[1:19:48] that's what brings anyone to a
[1:19:50] birth that life is the supernatural El
[1:19:54] El it it literally it it
[1:19:58] it it it brings you something that
[1:20:02] Fallen man can't acquire for
[1:20:05] himself it's
[1:20:07] impossible he can't save himself even if
[1:20:09] he knows he needs to even if he don't
[1:20:11] want to die and go to hell he still
[1:20:12] can't stop it see only the word of God
[1:20:16] coming don't lose your day of visitation
[1:20:20] friends God has sent a word in this hour
[1:20:23] it's not to be toyed with are played
[1:20:25] with it's to be believed it's to be
[1:20:27] eaten it's to be absorbed God has a plan
[1:20:30] for you to become the Living Word this
[1:20:33] was never intended to stay in a book
[1:20:35] brother Brenham said when the book is
[1:20:37] closed for the last time the word will
[1:20:39] be
[1:20:40] flesh
[1:20:42] hallelujah oh my it's not natural
[1:20:45] because our our sin birth is contrary to
[1:20:48] it you'd never be able to get there it's
[1:20:50] not natural it's it's it's contrary to
[1:20:52] our nature and and it'll be contrary to
[1:20:55] your nature for your entire life except
[1:20:57] that he comes and fills that
[1:21:00] vessel fills it with lightting drives
[1:21:02] out the darkness that we're born under
[1:21:04] and he brings forth the nature that's
[1:21:06] inside that
[1:21:07] Gene that was there all
[1:21:11] along but now
[1:21:13] see that's nothing less than the new
[1:21:18] birth and now he says to you who have
[1:21:23] passed from Death To Life
[1:21:25] abide in
[1:21:27] me you can't do anything without me I'm
[1:21:31] the vine you're the
[1:21:34] branches in me you have all the
[1:21:37] promises without no don't abide in me
[1:21:41] you have no access you have no
[1:21:43] guarantees the enemy can just come in
[1:21:46] and even though you have believed the
[1:21:48] word and have had an experience with God
[1:21:50] and many and we could I think we could
[1:21:52] all hear tonight and say I could say
[1:21:54] have you had an experience with the Lord
[1:21:56] if you ask me that I'm sure I'd give you
[1:21:58] the same answer you'd give me I brother
[1:22:00] Jason I've had many experiences with the
[1:22:02] Lord and I hope to have many more
[1:22:05] experiences with the Lord but there but
[1:22:08] I read you enough passages in the Bible
[1:22:10] to show you what Paul is interpreting
[1:22:13] what Jesus meant this is self-
[1:22:16] crucifixion this is dying daily this is
[1:22:18] denial this is in prayer this is in in
[1:22:21] dedication to the Lord this is your
[1:22:23] whole life this isn't staying on the
[1:22:25] east side of Jordan This is moving into
[1:22:27] the promised land and being willing to
[1:22:29] fight for God's God's given rights to
[1:22:38] you this is that
[1:22:41] portion this is that
[1:22:44] portion that involves
[1:22:47] you the new birth just the grace of
[1:22:50] God it's Grace plus nothing it's God God
[1:22:54] even God even gave you the faith to
[1:22:56] believe
[1:22:57] it you he not only gave you the word and
[1:23:00] gave you the gene he even gave you the
[1:23:03] faith to believe
[1:23:04] it see biting is the portion that
[1:23:08] involves your
[1:23:10] participation your willingness as I'm
[1:23:13] saying at the beginning your willing
[1:23:15] willingness as I'm saying at the
[1:23:17] beginning your willingness to survive or
[1:23:22] Thrive amen it's up to you to minut us
[1:23:26] to survive or
[1:23:29] Thrive many of us I'm I'm afraid are are
[1:23:33] only surviving on God's bottomless well
[1:23:35] of grace and mercy but Jesus wants you
[1:23:38] to have life and he wants you to have it
[1:23:41] more
[1:23:44] abundantly he wants you to have life and
[1:23:47] he wants you to have health and he wants
[1:23:48] you to have blessing and he wants you in
[1:23:51] the promised land and he will he wants
[1:23:54] you to have it
[1:24:01] abundantly a good friend of
[1:24:04] mine minister of the
[1:24:07] gospel and I'm I'm not going to name
[1:24:09] drop him tonight a fine
[1:24:11] man sees Visions I've known him for
[1:24:14] years I knew him when he was a single
[1:24:16] man I've definitely seen the power of
[1:24:19] God working in his life and his ministry
[1:24:21] you know and and and and I'm not here to
[1:24:24] expl it any further than
[1:24:27] that
[1:24:29] he God came to him he gave a testimony
[1:24:31] that I heard very
[1:24:34] recently and he actually came to his own
[1:24:37] pull pit and preached on John
[1:24:40] 15 on the exact same weekend I was
[1:24:43] preaching on
[1:24:44] it and and he tells a testimony I listen
[1:24:48] to the Saturday night very very powerful
[1:24:51] very moving I haven't got to hear the
[1:24:53] Sunday morning yet but
[1:24:56] the way it came to him and since I know
[1:24:58] him and the gift that operates in him
[1:25:00] and I've seen it over the years I have a
[1:25:02] lot of confidence in it he said that he
[1:25:05] saw
[1:25:07] himself on the on a boat out on stormy
[1:25:13] seas and on this boat he said he saw uh
[1:25:17] another best I can remember I think it
[1:25:19] was another boat that had capsized
[1:25:22] something like that anyway there was
[1:25:23] people in the
[1:25:25] water and there was all they were they
[1:25:28] had fallen overboard and the wave had
[1:25:30] capsized whatever it was and all of
[1:25:32] those people were in the water and he
[1:25:34] was oh we've got to do something what
[1:25:38] what can we do and and he said they were
[1:25:41] bobbing and going under and coming up
[1:25:43] and some of them were trying to dog
[1:25:45] paddle and swim as hard as they could
[1:25:47] and others were trying to roll over on
[1:25:48] their back and they were trying to float
[1:25:50] and they were trying to get you know and
[1:25:52] and the waves and he he thought I I got
[1:25:54] to go do something and he said a voice
[1:25:56] came SC cried out to him what will you
[1:25:58] do and he he ran and he said I'll look
[1:26:00] for life jackets and he couldn't find
[1:26:02] any life jackets and he thought I'll
[1:26:04] I'll find one of those life rings and
[1:26:06] I'll throw him a life ring he couldn't
[1:26:08] find that he said and he said I kept
[1:26:10] running I was running all over the boat
[1:26:11] and these people are drowning and he
[1:26:13] said I finally I found a rope and he
[1:26:16] said I came with that rope and I thought
[1:26:18] I'll throw this rope out there and I'll
[1:26:20] pull them all in and he said when I went
[1:26:22] to throw it he said suddenly it just
[1:26:25] just shriveled in his hands until it
[1:26:28] became this little skinny
[1:26:31] Vine just a little skinny Vine and he
[1:26:34] thought this won't even this will never
[1:26:37] I won't even pull one person with this
[1:26:38] this will break
[1:26:40] immediately and he said I I thought and
[1:26:44] he said the voice said what are you
[1:26:46] going to
[1:26:47] do and he said I yeah I answered back
[1:26:50] I'll just work with what I've got and he
[1:26:53] said I hurled that vine out there and he
[1:26:56] said the people started trying to swim
[1:26:58] for it and grab it and he said I thought
[1:27:00] it would break and he said that voice
[1:27:02] came roaring down through there and he
[1:27:04] said it's John 15 and they'll be all
