[0:03] God bless you all this morning amen if
[0:07] we can just stand and we're going to
[0:10] open up our Bibles this morning and read
[0:14] one verse out of
[0:17] Proverbs and that verse is in Proverbs
[0:20] 29 and verse 18 Proverbs
[0:27] 29:8 it says where there is no vision
[0:30] the people perish but he that keepeth
[0:34] the law happy is he amen let's pray
[0:38] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[0:39] day Lord we thank you just for the
[0:42] privilege of being able to come into
[0:44] your house Lord and worship together
[0:46] Lord I just pray that you could open up
[0:48] this word to us Lord just in a teaching
[0:50] manner this morning Father unveil your
[0:52] word to us we love you and we ask it in
[0:54] Jesus name amen God bless you as you
[0:57] take your seats this morning
[1:00] so I want to speak a little bit on uh on
[1:03] that scripture here where there is no
[1:05] vision the people perish but he that
[1:07] keepeth the law happy is he you know one
[1:10] of the most important things in our walk
[1:12] with the Lord is spiritual growth and
[1:16] maturity in the word you know that's
[1:17] what we're constantly striving for um
[1:20] this opening verse this morning speaks
[1:23] of a topic that I would just want to
[1:24] spend a few minutes on and it speaks of
[1:26] vision now it in the specific Greek or
[1:29] Hebrew translation of the word in this
[1:31] particular verse speaks more of a a
[1:34] prophetic Vision or uh a sense of
[1:37] Prophecy and Revelation but I'd like to
[1:38] take a more simple approach if I could
[1:41] on just having Vision spiritually
[1:44] speaking amen one definition of that
[1:47] word vision is the ability to think
[1:50] about or plan the future with
[1:54] imagination or wisdom think about or
[1:56] plan the future with imagination or
[1:59] wisdom I believe that in order to
[2:02] cultivate your future to help nurture
[2:04] and grow yourself spiritually it's
[2:07] Paramount that you have a certain amount
[2:09] of vision in our lives and in order for
[2:12] us to have Vision or in order for you to
[2:14] have vision for something you have to
[2:16] plan and and set goals so I think it's
[2:18] really an important thing to create
[2:20] goals spiritually in our lives I believe
[2:23] that's one of the ways that we can grow
[2:25] as Christians amen you know and I know
[2:27] that I know that the Lord Works in in
[2:30] trials and testings and I know that you
[2:32] know God uses those to train us for our
[2:34] future but he has already crafted
[2:37] something something totally and
[2:39] completely perfect something that leads
[2:41] you something that inspires you
[2:43] something that in it quickens you and
[2:45] it's something that's not just words on
[2:46] a page and it has the power of life and
[2:49] death in it amen and that's the word and
[2:52] uh you know we read it we absorb it we
[2:57] apply it then God inspires it and then
[2:59] it Quicken he quickens it in your life
[3:01] to make it a reality amen and so as much
[3:05] as trials and testings train us he has a
[3:08] word that trains us and I think that's
[3:10] one of the most important things that we
[3:12] how we can learn is through his word
[3:14] amen through the word that he's given
[3:16] through this and through the word of our
[3:17] day
[3:19] amen um there's an example I have this
[3:22] morning that kind of was where my
[3:25] inspiration came from for this it's
[3:26] something natural but I want to type it
[3:28] spiritually you know sometimes we have a
[3:30] vision of something in our minds um that
[3:34] we want to accomplish some task that we
[3:36] want to do um just naturally you know
[3:39] and I have this I have this little area
[3:41] in my in my backyard it's actually
[3:43] technically not my property um it's a
[3:46] part of a closed down uh golf course
[3:49] that closed down in our neighborhood
[3:51] probably 10 years ago um you know and so
[3:54] one or two of my neighbors on you know
[3:57] one side of me they actually take care
[3:59] of of you know their their portion of of
[4:02] that just and it what I've noticed over
[4:04] the years is it actually makes their
[4:06] yard look bigger and nicer and it's
[4:08] technically not their property but it's
[4:10] an extension of their property and it
[4:12] makes it look better and so this is
[4:14] something you know and it's not
[4:16] incredibly large either it's maybe 20 by
[4:18] 20 or or whatever um but ever since I
[4:22] moved in we've been in the house like 4
[4:23] and a half years it's something that you
[4:25] know I've had this thought in my mind
[4:27] that I want I would like to take care of
[4:29] ours the same way that they take care of
[4:31] theirs similar to that way because you
[4:34] know I think it makes it look nice and
[4:36] you know I I think maybe it'll make it
[4:38] look even bigger and more open and you
[4:41] know but for in order for me to have
[4:43] done that because it was a thought in my
[4:45] mind to do it for so long but in order
[4:47] for me to do it I had to take a step
[4:49] towards doing that and um you know I
[4:53] knew that there was going to be quite a
[4:54] bit of work involved because there's
[4:56] been you know eight nine ten years of
[4:59] weeds and brush and things that haven't
[5:01] been you know taken care of so I knew
[5:03] that it was going to be some work to get
[5:05] to the point where you know I could just
[5:08] maintain it like I maintain my yard so
[5:10] there was going to be some work involved
[5:12] in that so all I did was I naturally I
[5:15] took a I took one step forward and I
[5:18] started you know so I I began to cut
[5:20] back the weeds and I I Rak out all the
[5:23] brush and the pine cones and and all all
[5:26] of everything else and truly it was
[5:28] layers and layers and I did did this
[5:30] over the span of several weeks um
[5:33] because you know anybody with kids knows
[5:36] that time is precious and uh it was
[5:39] layers and layers and so one thing that
[5:41] I had is I did have a vision of kind of
[5:44] what I wanted it to look like because I
[5:45] had an idea I was I looked at my
[5:47] neighbors and his is very wellmaintained
[5:49] it looks just like his yard he doesn't
[5:51] water it but he mows it and it just
[5:53] looks really nice so I had a vision in
[5:56] mind of what I wanted it to look like
[5:58] and so I want to I want you to catch
[5:59] some things in this this story this
[6:01] morning now after every stage of or
[6:05] every layer that I took out if you were
[6:08] if you were to walk past this particular
[6:11] area and and look at it at the stage of
[6:14] development that it was in you wouldn't
[6:16] have been able to see the beauty that I
[6:19] saw but because I had a vision of what I
[6:22] saw before amen me we you know me and my
[6:25] wife has have been looking at it for
[6:27] years out outside of our back porch and
[6:29] we've watched the brush and you know
[6:31] just to be honest sometimes we'll throw
[6:33] sticks over there just because it's in
[6:35] our yard so and that's not you know
[6:36] that's probably not the best thing to do
[6:38] but that's just something we did so it's
[6:39] something we looked at for years so
[6:41] after every layer or every every time I
[6:43] went out there and I Rak and I spent a
[6:45] few hours here and a few hours there I
[6:47] would look out at this patch and I would
[6:50] see how much better it looked than when
[6:54] I started amen and so sometimes in our
[6:57] stages of development spiritually
[6:59] speaking you know other people may be
[7:02] walking by you you know just think
[7:03] spiritually this morning and they may
[7:05] not completely understand or they may
[7:07] not see the growth but if you can look
[7:09] at where you started from you can see
[7:12] that I am growing the Lord is taking
[7:15] weeds out of my life he's taking he's
[7:16] cultivating us right and so I I saw and
[7:19] I saw the the potential you know because
[7:22] I had out of vision I had an idea of
[7:25] what I was working towards and you know
[7:28] sometimes the trouble with doing certain
[7:29] things is that if we don't keep our mind
[7:31] or our eyes focused on the vision that
[7:34] we had when we started and we're only
[7:36] viewing
[7:37] things during the stages of development
[7:41] it can be really discouraging you know
[7:43] when you're when you're learning you
[7:45] know um when you're being trained as a
[7:49] Christian when you're when you're being
[7:50] matured in your walk with Christ you
[7:53] know sometimes you you can get
[7:55] discouraged because what we do as people
[7:57] is we look at another person men we look
[8:00] at you know well this person doesn't
[8:01] seem to have those kinds of flaws that I
[8:04] might have or this person seems to be so
[8:06] much further along than I am but it's
[8:09] because we're looking at more of an
[8:11] unfinished product and when you're
[8:13] looking at an unfinished product it
[8:14] doesn't always look so good in the
[8:16] process you know and the so the first
[8:18] few stages of of what I'd like to call
[8:20] my Campbell beautification project in my
[8:23] in my backyard it really didn't look
[8:25] like much you know like I said if you've
[8:26] seen it before um you know and you were
[8:29] and you didn't see it before you were
[8:30] just freshly walking by it probably
[8:31] looked pretty terrible but at each stage
[8:35] I was able to appreciate every uh every
[8:38] layer that I was able to take out and I
[8:42] looked past and you can ask my wife I
[8:43] really did this I looked after every
[8:45] time I went out there I looked out past
[8:47] our back porch and I and I admired the
[8:49] work that I did because I knew it took
[8:52] it took time it took effort you know and
[8:54] it really I mean it it was more of an
[8:56] extension of my property but it
[8:59] something something I knew that it would
[9:00] help you know make it look better and so
[9:03] I know this is Elementary this morning
[9:04] but you know sometimes spiritual growth
[9:06] in our life can you know it might be the
[9:09] same thing others might see it and they
[9:10] may not quite understand or even worse
[9:13] like we were talking about we begin to
[9:15] compare it to somebody else and we're
[9:18] not called to do that you don't compare
[9:20] yourself with another person you look at
[9:22] the word amen we look at what God has
[9:25] envisioned for us in the word and and on
[9:27] one side of that I believe it's it's
[9:29] awesome thing to have an exam have
[9:31] examples to look up to you know having
[9:33] parents that love the Lord or people
[9:35] that you admire you know you look at you
[9:37] know pastor and and you I think those
[9:39] things you know people that have such a
[9:41] prayer life you know or you know their
[9:44] character and and and being able to
[9:47] admire those those fine qualities but
[9:50] we're not supposed to compare ourselves
[9:52] to them you know had I compared what I
[9:55] was doing with what my neighbor had
[9:58] already done it would have been a
[9:59] pitiful comparison because he's been
[10:01] maintaining that for 10 years and it
[10:04] already has you know it already has
[10:07] everything it needs all it needs right
[10:09] now is just constant maintenance but he
[10:11] didn't have to work as hard because he
[10:13] started earlier and so it's never good
[10:15] to compare yourself to your brother or
[10:18] sister because their situation is
[10:20] different than yours amen maybe God
[10:23] called them at a different time than he
[10:25] called you you know maybe maybe even
[10:28] this maybe there maybe they've been
[10:30] cultivating their Garden you know
[10:32] spiritually speaking for 20 or 30 years
[10:34] maybe they've grown in maturity and
[10:37] they're at a different place than you
[10:39] are and now they've reached a great
[10:41] place of maturity in the word and you
[10:44] may not be there but that's okay because
[10:47] that and that shouldn't discourage us
[10:49] because you will get there God has a
[10:51] vision of you and you will get to that
[10:53] point the the point is to keep your
[10:55] vision in the word not on somebody else
[10:58] amen
[11:00] you know you know I just was thinking
[11:01] this morning you know I so I so greatly
[11:04] I admire and respect these brothers who
[11:06] who bring the word with with years of
[11:08] study and and dedication they have such
[11:11] a depth of knowledge of the message and
[11:13] how they bring the word forth and they
[11:15] with such prowess and and skill as they
[11:17] do but that doesn't discourage me just
[11:19] because I can't do it that way it
[11:21] inspires me amen Because by the help and
[11:23] the grace of God maybe one day I'll be
[11:26] there amen and it's not that I'm
[11:27] striving to to be as great as they are I
[11:30] just want to be as much as God called me
[11:32] to be amen and that's what our goal is
[11:34] to be as much as God called us to be in
[11:36] our potential amen you know and I think
[11:39] Believers as Believers we should set
[11:41] goals spiritually I I believe we should
[11:43] set goals in our life you know set goals
[11:46] in your walk with God sometimes daily or
[11:49] even weekly and challenge yourself to
[11:52] new things you know maybe read the Bible
[11:53] in a 100 days or go through the church
[11:56] age book in a in a week or whatever it
[11:57] is set attainable goals
[11:59] and watch the Lord cultivate and grow
[12:02] you in maturity and in wisdom you know
[12:04] you know we're not I've said this before
[12:06] but you know you're not born again and
[12:07] then the very next day you're fully
[12:09] mature Christians that's just not the
[12:10] way it works sometimes I wish it was
[12:12] that way but that's just not the way it
[12:14] works amen God trains us and of course a
[12:17] part of that is testings and trials but
[12:19] I'm under the belief that even a a
[12:22] bigger part of that is dedication to his
[12:24] word amen delight yourself in the Lord
[12:27] meditate on it day and night amen he
[12:29] will establish you his word is what what
[12:32] matures you reading it and studying it
[12:35] and applying it you know meditating on
[12:37] it what he does is he takes the words
[12:39] that you know the difference between you
[12:41] know a Believer and an unbeliever
[12:42] reading the Bible or reading the word is
[12:44] that you know he can Quicken these words
[12:47] in your life and make it a living
[12:49] reality amen if there's nothing in there
[12:51] calling out to this then it can't become
[12:53] a living reality but because you are
[12:55] part of the word when you read this God
[12:57] makes it a living reality for you amen
[13:00] and in order to cultivate that to happen
[13:02] you need to read it and study and apply
[13:04] yourself to it amen and and remember
[13:07] that as you grow we aren't to look at
[13:09] our neighbor as your mark amen we are to
[13:12] look at the word and you know every once
[13:14] in a while I think it's good to maybe
[13:15] look back at where you started look at
[13:18] how far you've come look at all the the
[13:20] weeds and the nonsense that God has
[13:22] pulled out from your life and and how
[13:24] much you've gained in the process you
[13:26] know I believe much of of the grow
[13:29] that we you know attain spiritually just
[13:32] comes from the process Alone um you know
[13:35] many people many times you know I've
[13:37] heard it say you know it's all about
[13:39] getting to the destination you know and
[13:41] I don't know how the saying goes but the
[13:43] journey to the destination is really
[13:45] what impacts you to reach the goal
[13:47] because it's the day-to- day it's the
[13:49] every day amen of your life um The Grind
[13:52] of being Christian and reading the word
[13:54] and and allowing the Lord to uh pluck
[13:57] things out of your life that that maybe
[13:59] have hindered you and then watching
[14:02] watching that word grow in your life and
[14:04] in your family's life and watching him
[14:06] change and and nurture that you know
[14:10] um where there is no vision the people
[14:14] perish when you get when you get to live
[14:17] in a Christian Life every day and you
[14:19] have no
[14:20] vision it can actually truly hinder you
[14:25] uh I want to contrast something here
[14:26] this morning this is this is different
[14:29] than when Jesus said take no thought for
[14:33] tomorrow amen you know because we're
[14:35] supposed to trust God for these things
[14:37] but setting goals and planning you know
[14:40] spiritually speaking even Naturally
[14:41] Speaking is something that the word
[14:43] teaches us to do even brother brandham
[14:45] taught us that we are to plan as if he
[14:46] won't come for 100 years but live as if
[14:48] he's coming today right and I'm not so
[14:50] much talking about the natural things
[14:52] you know although it's great to plan for
[14:53] the natural but Focus the focus is
[14:56] having a vision on how you want to grow
[14:58] spirit spiritually you know and one of
[15:00] the I mean just some simple Concepts
[15:02] this morning you know it's it's it's
[15:03] really a good thing to be honest with
[15:05] yourself you know I think if we're
[15:07] honest with ourselves we wouldn't need
[15:09] or shouldn't need others to point out
[15:11] our flaws we can pretty much recognize
[15:13] what they are amen if you really reflect
[15:17] on your daytoday you can you know take
[15:20] account for yourself and say I really
[15:23] want to grow in this area you know I may
[15:25] not be as mature as I want to be in this
[15:27] area you know I have I have some some
[15:29] things I want to pluck up or I want to
[15:31] change or I want to grow in and and you
[15:33] know I think we're um I don't think
[15:37] anybody's fooling anybody if you think
[15:38] you're perfect and you don't have room
[15:39] to grow we all have areas that we need
[15:42] growth in amen some of us are further
[15:45] along and some of us are more mature and
[15:46] that's okay but you know just f look at
[15:49] yourself reflect on what it is that you
[15:51] want to grow on and then focus on on
[15:54] that area maybe you know uh our temper
[15:57] is a little red hot sometimes or maybe
[15:58] we patience or you know maybe even our
[16:01] pride needs a little adjustment you know
[16:02] I'm not going to start just putting all
[16:04] these things because there's just a
[16:05] whole list but whatever it is just start
[16:07] with those things today um you know we
[16:11] know we're not perfect yet God knows
[16:13] we're not perfect yet so you know if you
[16:15] just if you start uh if you need a
[16:18] starting point today start with that
[16:20] list take those things to the Lord in
[16:22] prayer you know start with a list um you
[16:25] know and be sincere with it have have
[16:26] the right attitude about it and and then
[16:30] then begin to to cultivate a betting
[16:32] ground that the Lord could actually
[16:34] change that characteristic in you
[16:36] because if you go with if you go at it
[16:38] with an attitude well I'm just never
[16:39] gonna I'm just not never going to change
[16:42] you know this is just the way that I am
[16:44] if you have that kind of attitude about
[16:46] it then how the how is the Lord ever
[16:47] going to change you you need to be able
[16:49] to have a humble heart and say maybe
[16:51] this is the way that I am maybe I do
[16:52] have a gene pool that isn't the greatest
[16:54] or maybe maybe this maybe that but I
[16:56] don't want to be that way Lord I want
[16:57] you to change me I want you to grow me
[16:59] and I believe that he's faithful to do
[17:01] that God he said to Sarah is there
[17:03] anything impos is there anything too
[17:05] hard for the Lord no there's nothing too
[17:07] hard for the Lord amen and um you know
[17:11] like I said just be humble about it and
[17:12] then some of the just the basic concepts
[17:15] is is search it out in the word you know
[17:18] whatever flaw it is I'm sure somebody
[17:21] had the same flaw in scripture and find
[17:23] out what the Lord did for them to change
[17:25] their heart in that matter amen that's
[17:27] just a very simple concept but um you
[17:30] know I was thinking about uh Abraham
[17:34] yesterday and and his growth you know if
[17:36] you think about Abraham think about this
[17:38] he lied about Sarah being his wife at
[17:41] two separate occasions you know and I
[17:44] think about how his wife must have
[17:45] thought about him at that point in his
[17:47] life it seems like a pretty cowardly
[17:49] move to do that you know but yet Abraham
[17:53] grew so much and Sarah had so much
[17:56] respect for him and reverence for him at
[17:59] at a later point in his life that Sarah
[18:01] actually called him Lord you know
[18:03] meaning I reverence him and I respect
[18:05] him you know how did he get from point A
[18:07] to point B God matured him God grew him
[18:11] God God changed him amen he didn't I was
[18:14] thinking about Josiah you know I
[18:15] preached on that last time I I I
[18:17] preached here and you know Josiah he
[18:19] started reigning at eight years old just
[18:20] a child um by the but by the end of his
[18:24] kingdom he had gained so much respect by
[18:27] the people for for his character and by
[18:29] what he did that the entire Kingdom if
[18:32] you go read the end of that book the
[18:33] entire Kingdom assembled together
[18:35] listened to him as he had the Scrolls
[18:38] read and and they just had such a deep
[18:40] reverence for him I'm sure that there
[18:43] was some people who were pretty
[18:44] skeptical in his kingdom that an
[18:46] eight-year-old was going to Reign I mean
[18:48] just think naturally you know this
[18:49] eight-year-old what what is he going to
[18:50] do for the kingdom but God trained him
[18:53] and matured him and he made some pretty
[18:55] great decisions along the way because
[18:57] God inspired his heart and then by the
[18:59] end of his ministry you know we all have
[19:00] Ministries by the end of his ministry
[19:02] they had a deep reverence and a deep
[19:04] respect for him but if he would have
[19:05] went to the temple at age8 and tried to
[19:07] get them to do this would he have had
[19:09] that same maturity would have he had
[19:12] that same respect probably not but the
[19:13] god used it and changed him he and God
[19:16] used him in a big way amen um so I think
[19:19] it's I think it's important you know to
[19:21] set goals spiritually if you don't have
[19:23] a a vision for your life you know in
[19:26] areas that you want to grow and mature
[19:28] in the word and actually set goals to
[19:31] accomplish them you know the scripture
[19:33] says you know you're you're going to
[19:35] perish spiritually you'll wither away
[19:36] you'll never have motivation you'll
[19:38] never uh you know those types of things
[19:41] when you do those things they can
[19:43] actually motivate you you know when I
[19:45] set a goal of you know I want to start
[19:48] uh you know try to read the church age
[19:49] book once a year I don't cross that off
[19:51] in my mind until I'm finished with it
[19:53] even if it takes me weeks and then I
[19:56] always get something new out of it amen
[19:59] and you know when you set goals in your
[20:01] mind to grow and mature in his word I
[20:05] promise you'll never be disappointed in
[20:07] that you know you you might get
[20:09] disappointed in yourself on how you're
[20:11] achieving that goal but you'll never be
[20:13] disappointed on the effects that it has
[20:16] in your life if if you stick with it
[20:19] amen the and the last part of that
[20:21] scripture says it like this happy is he
[20:23] that keepeth the law you know and I I
[20:26] thought about this this verse of
[20:28] scripture I think can actually be
[20:29] applied as medicine in your life it's
[20:32] it's an allnatural anti-depressant
[20:34] because when we have a vision when we
[20:37] keep our minds in the word our thoughts
[20:40] can begin to shift direction towards
[20:43] positivity um you know and I have this
[20:45] quote a brother shared with me the other
[20:47] day and I felt like it kind of
[20:48] dovetailed with this scripture um it
[20:50] talks about keeping your mind alert to
[20:53] the word one of Satan's uh biggest
[20:56] Avenues I believe that he uses in people
[20:59] is when they you know have empty Minds
[21:02] you know people who just spend alone
[21:03] time with with their own thoughts
[21:05] because that's a prime time for the
[21:07] enemy to plant things in your mind that
[21:09] you can then dwell on and then once you
[21:11] start going down that path dwelling on
[21:13] the wrong thing it can be a slippery
[21:15] slope in the wrong direction right so
[21:17] and we're Christians so we're built so
[21:20] that the word can be planted in our
[21:22] minds not so we can just have empty
[21:23] minds but so the word can go in our
[21:26] minds that it can grow in our minds seed
[21:28] in our hearts then you know quicken in
[21:31] our souls right and um brother Brandon
[21:34] preached it preached this message
[21:36] pursuing and he's talking about
[21:37] experiences and he says you know uh
[21:41] 1962 presuming and it's in paragraph 67
[21:44] it says you know I heard someone was in
[21:46] a meeting here some time ago and someone
[21:48] said just let your mind go blank now
[21:50] just look right straight up towards the
[21:52] skies let your mind go blank and you'll
[21:55] get an experience and no doubt but what
[21:58] you that's right but you get an
[22:00] experience but what an experience you
[22:02] see when you do that you're just opening
[22:04] your soul to Satan you just open your
[22:07] soul to Satan he'll give you something
[22:09] that's true but I think a person coming
[22:11] to Christ should come with all the
[22:13] intelligence they got and quoting in
[22:15] their mind when they come to him every
[22:17] promise in the scripture keep your mind
[22:20] alert when you come to Christ don't let
[22:22] it go blank the devil will make you do
[22:24] anything see so and he's talking about
[22:27] specifically exper experiences you know
[22:29] and he's pointing out how you know
[22:32] specifically like you know when a
[22:33] Pentecostal would have you know they
[22:35] speak in tongues and then they have an
[22:36] experience and they thought that that
[22:38] was the that was the key you have the
[22:40] Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues and
[22:42] and you know the devil can mimic that
[22:43] type of thing but just just to to bring
[22:46] it into a more simple he said um keep
[22:49] your mind alert when you come to Christ
[22:51] don't let it go blank because when the
[22:54] enemy come in comes in your mind and
[22:57] when you're you're just not you're not
[22:59] dwelling on the word and you're just D
[23:00] dwelling on natural things your mind
[23:02] just begins to drift and as it drifts
[23:05] then the enemy has this portal that he
[23:07] gets into and then he starts to to plant
[23:10] seeds in your mind and those things are
[23:13] just I mean it happens to all of us but
[23:15] those are those are how the enemy ends
[23:17] up wrecking your future down the road
[23:20] because it starts with just thoughts and
[23:22] then those thoughts lead into actions
[23:23] and those actions lead to more just
[23:25] chaos right so if you just keep your
[23:27] mind on the word when you have when you
[23:30] have that time then it just creates an
[23:33] atmosphere for the Lord to be able to
[23:36] to to grow you and to mature you
[23:40] amen um don't let it you know don't
[23:44] don't don't just leave it blank in other
[23:45] the worlds sometimes you just need to to
[23:47] clear your mind well that's that's okay
[23:49] you clear your mind and then fill it
[23:50] with the word amen
[23:53] amen um do you love the Lord amen good I
[23:57] do too um and just a little update for
[24:00] my project this morning I was telling
[24:01] you about in my backyard I think it
[24:02] looks pretty good um I I still don't
[24:05] think it looks as good as my neighbor um
[24:08] but that's okay it's definitely progress
[24:11] from when I
[24:12] started amen so so set goals um on how
[24:16] and where you want to grow and and this
[24:18] could just be this part could just be
[24:19] for for the younger people but maybe
[24:21] there's something that you haven't
[24:23] completely understood maybe it was some
[24:25] Doctrine or or some scripture search it
[24:27] out study it uh you know meditate on it
[24:30] maybe there's a book in the Bible that
[24:31] you've never searched out and read
[24:33] through and studied make strides to do
[24:35] that and get get a vision on areas that
[24:38] you want to improve on you know I I
[24:41] remember back and it not like it was a
[24:42] long time ago but when I when I first
[24:44] started studying the message and I used
[24:46] to think how in the world am I ever
[24:48] going to take all this in you know but
[24:50] the Lord and I still haven't but you
[24:52] know the Lord takes you through things
[24:54] and he grows you in your understanding
[24:56] and the more you hear something Faith
[24:58] cometh by hearing and then hearing of
[25:00] the word of God and God just increases
[25:02] you in your understanding and it's not
[25:04] going to you're not going to read uh you
[25:06] know the whole Bible through one time
[25:08] and understand it all I promise you
[25:10] you're not going to read one message
[25:12] through and then and catch everything
[25:14] that God wants you to catch it's
[25:15] compounding amen it's continual it's
[25:18] inspired it's it's Revelation you know
[25:20] so um but but Concepts that used to seem
[25:24] to me like so difficult to understand or
[25:26] seem like that they were just these
[25:27] great far off Mysteries or they were
[25:29] only for people who who who really study
[25:32] the word or they were just for preachers
[25:34] that that was that's the enemy working
[25:37] it's for you if it's in the word it's
[25:39] for you amen if it's in the message it's
[25:41] for you don't let the enemy think that
[25:43] you just you just uh set goals set
[25:46] attainable goals in your life to make
[25:48] strides to do to do that amen it's for
[25:50] all of us my my dad and I and i' I've
[25:52] said this a lot I wanted to just say
[25:54] this at the end my dad and I like to
[25:55] send uh each other words of the day and
[25:58] so my word of the day today if you
[25:59] haven't realized is cultivate and uh you
[26:02] know and besides in farming and and
[26:04] gardening to cultivate to Divine is to
[26:07] nurture and help grow or apply oneself
[26:10] to improving or developing spiritually
