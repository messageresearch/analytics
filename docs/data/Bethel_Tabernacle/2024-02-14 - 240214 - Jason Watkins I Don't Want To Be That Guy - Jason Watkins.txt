[Music] my oh Lord be [Music] glorify amen amen praise the Lord you love the Lord amen are you happy to be in his house tonight are you happy to be his house tonight amen praise God we're going to invite you right into Jeremiah's gospel amen start there and we'll we'll read Jeremiah 10 and um 11-6 and then we're going to uh come back over to the New Testament we'll pick up 1 Thessalonians 5 amen praise God Amen glad to see y'all out on a Wednesday night God bless you amen we're going to take up some prayer requests uh here just shortly amen but we amen want to see what the Lord has for us in the word amen praise the Lord I'm going to take an unusual title tonight and um titles are huge to me so I really thought about this one a lot I thought about not using it but I want to use it that be all right I'm gonna take a title tonight I don't want to be that guy that's right amen praise the Lord let's look in Jeremiah chapter 10 verse 11- 16 amen thus shall you say unto them the gods that have not made the heavens and the Earth even they Shall Perish from the earth and from under the heavens he hath made the Earth by his power he hath established the World by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion sounds like the prophet is trying to set the record straight of who built everything there's obviously some some opinion among the people that maybe it was some other God all right so we've got a divided opinion here and the Lord is sending a prophet to set the record straight verse 13 when he utth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapors to descend from the ends of the Earth he maketh Lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures every man is brutish in his knowledge every founder is confounded by the Graven image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them they are vanity and the work ofation they Shall Perish ish I think this is an exceptionally relevant scripture given that we are in such an age of idolatry and everything is an idol these days verse 16 I love this look at him draw the line of demarcation the portion of Jacob is not like them amen the portion of Jacob is not like them for he is the former of all things and Israel is the rod of his inheritance the Lord of hosts is his name amen let's let's pray then we'll go to second I mean 1 Thessalonians 5 Lord we commit now the reading of the word into your care and I just settle myself now Lord into this unusual approach tonight to a sermon and I am asking for your Divine favor Lord that you will help help me Lord to deliver it as it has evolved opening up to me I pray this in the name of Jesus Christ amen I'm going to dismiss you guys y'all can head on off and we'll turn to first Thessalonians 5 amen while we still have you standing 1 Thessalonians 5 is um really special to me because it was the second text I ever took in a sermon amen I I took my very first sermon out of brother bram's message in influence in Chicago in 1963 and so naturally I went to where he went to in Isaiah 6 the Lord high and lifted up but uh when I came to this second sermon ever way back 30 plus years ago I preached a sermon called identification and I wanted to show that you're not them and they ain't you right all right we've already read where God has said the portion of Jacob is not like these false gods the portion of Jacob is the true God and I'm not like those false gods I'm not a Graven image I'm not just something that doesn't have any life in it I'm a living being amen and now you're going to find that the holy spirit is going to lead St Paul Paul to show the church that they're not at least they're not supposed to be like The World God you remember the story brother brandham tells about the slave how that he had come he was a royalty in Africa and here in slavery though brother Bram said though A Slave he knew where he'd come from he knew his real identity and said though here A Slave he conducted himself like a King's son and the prophet said That's you and I we're right here in in in um walking among those slaves to sin the world is slaved to sin but while we're here we are realizing that we're not from here we're not finishing here thank God oh my friends we have a home waiting a royalty amen and you you want to take notice of that fact as we read in 1 Thessalonians 5 uh I read a more of it when I preached that second sermon I'm only going to read verses 4-9 right now but ye Brethren are not in darkness he spoke about people who are in darkness but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief he had just got done saying to those who are walking in darkness that day of judgment shall overtake them as a thief now you don't know a thief's coming he surprises you all right right so they're going to get a surprise cuz the raptures nothing like they think the tribulation is nothing like they think the Millennium is nothing like they think the Judgment bar is nothing like they think see verse five ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness therefore because of that since that is true having now understood what I just said therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober so clearly you're not supposed to be like them CU you're not them you're his and our mission here is to find all of his and persuade them to be like him amen verse 8 but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for in helmet the hope of Salvation so you got something to do so Christianity is not just me memory verse amen it's not just a form it's not just a tradition it's an experience all right you put on something you put on the breastplate of Faith you wear it you know everybody in here I can see what you got on because you're wearing it you ought people ought to be able to see the Christianity because you're wearing it amen there ought to be no no no mistaking you know I I if if I if if Matt is wearing this brownish collar jacket I'm not going to come in here and go hey Matt that's a really nice yellow jacket well you would think I'm crazy well when people say I'm a Christian but they don't look like this I don't know what garment you have on but the gospel produces the same kind of garment on everybody so he says but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not a pointed us to wrath that's good news so what are you going to do with it I'm here to give you good news he has a he has not appointed you to wrath so what what are you g to do about that I mean if I said today hey guess what every one of you want a million do and all you got to go is go up the street and claim it and would you sit here and go yeah I got better things to do I ain't got time I'm kind of busy see so God hath not appointed us to wrath has he appointed us to something since he has not appointed us to wrath yes but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ I'd say that's a pretty good deal amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can have your seats title slide I don't want to be that guy what a title title which will live in infamy amen are you are you comfortable everybody seated and nice and comfortable okay well the real family of God please stand up good I want to make sure who I was preaching to tonight amen now you can be seated family of God he had said and told us in Jeremiah 10:14 every man is brutish in his knowledge I think I could say tonight and I think every brother in here would agree with me that if he says every man is brutish in his knowledge I'd say I don't I don't want to be that guy is that aair Brothers I don't want to be that guy that brutish guy is arrogant he's flippant he's he's he's forceful he he has he's he's opinionated he exalts his own thinking above the thinking of God and above the word he esteems himself too highly I don't want to be that guy you know I I the one of the reasons that I was telling sister debb and it's it's my inspiration I know you can't look at it and see that I'm very inspired but believe me I am I was sitting in Walmart and she was or a grocery store somewhere and she was and I was sitting there and I and I seen this poor old gentleman come in aged well-aged and just completely bent over and just shuffling in little two-inch steps I felt terribly sorry for him and I thought to myself I am I don't want to be that guy I I don't want to get that age and be old and decrep it if I get that way please push me over a cliff well off take me to the mountains and push me or take me out Mike take me surfing push me off the board buddy amen you got my permission if you see me like that praise the Lord even sister Debbie will want you to do that amen but I don't want to be a brutish guy I don't want to be a pinion I don't want to be of the night I don't want to sleep in the day I want to be awake in the day I want to be vigilant I want to be sober the world is going to destruction men are men are going to die and brother brandham called him Atomic F I don't want to be those guys they're going to die by the millions I don't want to be those guys and it's not going to be God's fault we've proven that many many times so we found out that not only is God different but God expects his people to be different that's what we discovered it between Jeremiah 10 and 1 Thessalonians 5 so now I could have I could have easily included women sisters just you're included in this thought tonight uh because of the principle now I could have I could have put a bunch of Bible women up here who are who are in the Bible I could have started I could have started with Eve and I could have finished with the great harlot in the Book of Revelation I could have got the women in the crowd of musicians and friends who laughed Jesus to scorn when he's coming to raise the daughter of Jas and they're right there in his house laughing at him I could have taken herodias and her daughter uh in Matthew 14 who called for the head of John the Baptist you sisters you you want to say I don't want to be that gal poor she called for the head of John the Baptist how many sisters would say I don't want to be that gal see I could have taken the two different women who pointed out Peter and outed him as a follower of Jesus at the trial there that night to stir up the crowd and cause trouble in Matthew 26 I I could have spoken about the women uh The woman there in uh acts 16 who had the spirit of divination who followed Paul and Silas around motive in doing that she had an evil spirit so there there's plenty of women in the Bible I could have started with Jezebel there's plenty of women in the Bible sisters who you could fairly say tonight with the brothers and I'm going to take some men out of the Bible and men are going to say I don't want to be that guy and you sisters can say I don't want to be that girl oh just make sure you uh did that do that automatically or did you do that Esther yeah okay okay sis just leave that on and so cuz uh I want to have it a certain effect amen thank you that that that's what you're supposed to do but tonight I want an exception four men who failed God four men who had a chance Judas from left to right Judas the Rich Young Ruler the nephew of Abraham lot king joash of Israel when we think of Judas scariot as Matthew 26:14 says then one of the 12 called Judas es scariot went unto the chief priest he was going as you know the story he's going to betray the Lord and you know it's it's amazing when I read about it in the scripture and when he comes to Jesus there in the night and the soldiers are behind him in Jesus he says whomever I greet with a kiss this is the one you take him and you and and he comes to Jesus to greet him with the the son of man with a kiss think there's no coming back from that have you really thought it through that this decision all it is for you is a decision but it will seal your Eternal Destiny when I think about that I think about how that God gave Judas an opportunity to not go through with it but I think that that the decision that Judas made and this is just brother Jason tonight I I think that the decision that Judas made was a decision that he made ultimately by that I mean that he had been on a path of decisions all along the way following Jesus you don't come to a decision like that in a moment just like Jesus you've heard me say it before Jesus went to Calvary because he had been going to Calvary his whole life he was preparing for that you tell me how old he was when he first how old was he when he first picked up the book of Isaiah and he read about he shall be as a lamb led to the slaughter how old was he was he eight was he 10 was he 12 he was a human child and he reads that verse and he realizes suddenly that's me he was making these decisions Judas was all along the path along the way following Jesus making them while while going in that direction all along at every point at at every point and I want to talk about those points tonight those those elusive hardto detect points in our lives where we are unaware that we are making decisions that are going to shape the destiny of our life am we we make so many decisions in a in a in any given day and sometimes the thing will get on our mind and God will challenge us and don't think Satan won't be there to challenge you to try to get you to take his path and I just want to say with you with with the prophet of God choose Christ choose the word always every time all the time because it you don't realize that sometimes they're very hard to detect these points in our lives I I was speaking to to a young man one time and well you know I'll just I'll just have to say it who it is and it was my younger brother who I believe God took him took home a a uh an unrepentant child that's my belief that's where my faith is and uh and I believe it especially since I've seen him on the other side and and I know he's there and so so we find that you know one time he said to me Jay the lord loves you more than he does me I said why you say that Nate he says well look at your life and look at mine your life is blessed and my life is so cursed and upside down I said just a second little bro just a second I said you put your feet under the same kitchen table that I did we slept in the same bed we had the same parents we went to the same church we had the same Pastor every age that you reached I reached you were 16 once I was 16 once you were 20 I was 20 ahead of you you finally got to 25 I've been to 25 I said the difference is that at every one of those points we were making different choices so it's not your parents fault God's fault your pastor's fault your friend's fault anybody's fault it's not even completely the devil's fault you need to say it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer I'm glad for the choice God made to bring a wayward son home Judas could have changed course anyone can but at each point he stayed on a course that led him to what I would call an irrevocable conclusion about Christ the ultimate that ultimate conclusion then informed his final decision and by the time Jesus offered him that at pause he was already determined and committed to betrayal I don't think he made that decision overnight not at all that's a rather haunting look in the eyes if you ask me brother brandham speaks of how Jud thought that Jesus could get out of it he thought wrong now Jesus could get out of it but he wasn't going to get out of it because that was the plan of God the plan of God for Jesus was that he go forward in this sense Judas doomed himself by failing to understand the word of God for his hour amen if he thought that Jesus could get out of it and would get out of it he clearly didn't understand the word of his day at that moment it's fair to say that none of the disciples did but it is a lesson for us tonight friends you want to no wonder brother brandham said pray for Revelation above everything because you don't want to make a wrong decision because you don't understand the day and the hour that you live that's why billions are going down an atomic destruction of their own doing because they fail like Judas they fail to to know the word for their hour see so you know I would just say tonight that sometimes we come across things in the word we don't understand sometimes things happen in life that we don't understand but I want to say to you that just because you don't understand something God has said or something God has did or something that God has allowed don't resist him stay humble whatever you do stay surrendered and ask him to make it clear just start knocking just start knocking say Lord I need to understand this part of your word I need to understand this thing that happened in my life I need to understand why you allow that and don't stop knocking until he opens Jesus and invited you to ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that askthe findeth and to him that knocketh brother R said that meant to just continually knock and just keep on knocking until when yeah for how long Lord you getting tired but how brother brandom Lord you getting tired of me out here knocking I ain't leaving I need an answer and I'm just going to keep r on knocking I'm here to tell you something friends even a an unjust judge will finally get up and open the door how much more your heavenly father the next one in our left to right line was the Rich Young Ruler Mark 10:17 and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running y to him and ask him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life my what a question you talking about an opportunity squandered this man had it all riches power influence youth health strength had so much that he had to he thought I'm going to tear my barns down and tomorrow I'm going to build bigger ones and he didn't know that there was an angel standing behind him and said you fool this very night you're unaware that this very night you've got plans for tomorrow that you'll never see this very night your soul is going to be required of you and he stood there someone who I mean I mean this you're talking about a man who had it all even Jesus loved him someone who knew the Commandments and had observed them from his youth but yet still lacking eternal life brother Brenham says he was a very successful that's his words a successful religious businessman amen he says in the message leadership I would recommend that every man man especially young men and and and the sisters again alike here brother californ de the 7th 1965 one of the last it's his actually his last text sermon he preaches a communion service uh after that but this is his last text sermon so brother brandham says it like this talking about this rich ruler how that he was a successful businessman nothing had went wrong he was perfectly cut out right measured up right intelligent right education his success he was smart a fine businessman probably belonged to the businessman's group somewhere in Palestine he might have belonged to a businessman's fellowship like we have here tonight no doubt he did because businessmen has always had fellowships with one another one with the other and he W listen to this and he was as religious as he could be now I just want you to absorb that he's as religious as he could be but he didn't have eternal life so I think it's safe to say that you need to be something more than you can be amen you need to be something he can make out of you he he was as religious as he could be because Jesus had questioned him here and he said I have kept these Commandments observe them all from my youth that's right see and he had been brought ight taught right and this is a prophet and everything no wonder I started with you talking about an opportunity squandered he had everything but when he was confronted with the thought of eternal life now I want you to notice with all this character that he had yet he knew he did not possess eternal life it's why he asked see he had been he had been brought upright he says all right with all of this character yet he knew he did not possess eternal life and no matter how successful we've been in business how successful successful we've been and what a great church member we are and how we work how we try to do things right thank you God bless you that's wonderful I could compliment every last one of you Brothers in here tonight you're successful you're businessmen you've done good God has blessed you Jesus loves you but do you have eternal life amen no matter how successful we've been in business how successful we've been and what a great church member we are and how we work and how we try to do things right still if it's not done in the right way it is a worship of God in vain now think now think listen to this a sincere honest worship with the sincerity of your heart to God and still be in vain prophet says but here was his problem he refused to be guided he refused to accept the real leadership of Jesus Christ to give him eternal life you're talking about an opportunity squandered I don't want to be that guy I don't want to be that guy I don't want to be that guy Brothers I don't want to be that guy Brothers I don't want to be that guy we can go here to Abraham's nephew lot Genesis 13:12 Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards Sodom of course he was a type of the foolish virgin that lived too involved in leoa a religious Man Child of God going to make it to Heaven at the Judgment bar miss the Rapture foolish ver you're going to miss the Rapture say well at least if I make it to Heaven great but that's not the deal I want I want to make a Rapture I want to be part of the first resurrection I don't want to live too comfortably in Leo deia because that identifies me that identifies me can I say it again lot a type of the foolish virgin what was his outstanding attribute brother Jason living too involved in Leo deia amen living too too involved in his age brother brandham says in 1963 is your life worthy of the Gospel remember lot he was a smart man look at him just a minute now look look let's stop a minute Prophet is preaching my favorite sermon in the whole message is your life worthy of the gospel and he he's trying to get the audience to say pay attention pay attention stop look look stop just a minute don't don't blow over him don't to say oh he was just living too comfortably in Sodom he was living too in he was too involved in Leo deia I get it brother Jason stop wait a minute hold on pray just a second in Your Heart Lord let me see it open your understanding may God do it just take this nation alone let's see what God Said the Bible said that the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous soul daily he just didn't have the plain nerve enough to stand out against it I don't want to be that guy George I don't want to be that guy I don't want to be that guy brother Mark I don't want to be that guy JD I don't want to be that guy how about you Brothers I want to have the nerve to stand against it I'm not against people but I'm against the spirit of the age come on young people get in I want I don't want to be that amen I don't want to be that Dan Danny I don't want to be that I I I want to have a enough courage to stand against the age that we live in and say this is ungodly and I'm not a part of it I'm from a different world I marched to a different drum the Bible says the Sin of Sodom vexed his righteous Soul the righteous soul of lot daily he just didn't have the plain nerve enough to stand out against it that's right he couldn't do it he was the mayor of the city he couldn't but the Bible said the sins of the sodomites vexed his soul he knowed it was wrong but he didn't have nerve to do it to stand out against it just didn't have the plain nerve to stand against it now look how many Lots in America yesterday reading their Bible to prepare their message for the day and run across water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ how many of them run across the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ same yesterday and forever Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe John 14 he that believeth on me the works of do shall he do also if you abide in me in my word and you shall ask what you will it shall be done how many Lots saw that but because of their excuse of their denomination look out and see in the Bible look at their Congregation of Bob haired women and they know the Bible condemns it look going down the street at their own church members going down the street with shorts on and they know the word is against it but they haven't got the nerve to call out against it but yet the man professing to be a Christian his soul within him cries out against it but he hasn't got the nerve if that ain't a modern Sodom where is it at I don't want to be that man when I'm in my study and I come across the scripture I want to be able to come to this pull pit and preach to you the whole counsel of God brother brandham says give us somebody that'll cry out against it that's right like John the Baptist the ax is laid to the root of the tree that's what we need today oh bethl Tabernacle would you like to put courage in your pastor's heart tonight and say brother Jason we want it straight would you like to let bethl Ministry team say we want it straight raise up those hands and say we want it straight we don't want it watered down look at that Brothers my ministering Brothers they want it straight let's lay the ax to the root of the tree and give them the truth in the face of criticism in the face of a Dying World that's getting worse by the hour I'm believing that you don't want compromise am I correct we find our next man joash king of Israel this is the king brother Bram called him a backslid king that came to the to the deathbed of Elisha now Elisha was Fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and joash the king of Israel came down unto him and wept over his face The Story Goes On you've read it many times where the Elisha revived a little bit and and he told him said take your bow and open the window and said fire your arrows and when he fired an arrow he said the arrow of the Lord's deliverance and he said now take your quiver and smash it on the ground ground and this Half Baked half-hearted lukewarm Israelite King the direct descendant of David God's chosen people whack whack whack okay I did my duty and the prophet was angry said you should have smitten it four or five times then you could have completely destroyed that enemy as it is now all you'll get is three victories you're only going to get out of it what you put in it I don't want to be that guy it's not the kind of preacher I want to be it's not the kind of Shepherd I want to be it's not the kind of husband I want to be it's not the kind of daddy the kind of Grandpa that's not who I want to be says in 1956 the arrow of God's Deliverance shot from a bow that's a title for you now look friend down along they come along after Ahab talking about the kings that came after Ahab they came along after Ahab of borderline Believers all the way down after this Ahab had left then another one taken his place another one till we got down to King joash was king during this time and he was a lukewarm borderline preacher or believer any way the people wanted to do that was all right with joash oh he had taken out a few of the high places and where the Heathen worship was and he had done a few of these things but yet he departed not from the sins of his father and like that and like that just any way the people wanted to go that's the way he wanted to go now isn't that just exactly like preachers today the way the congregation wants to do that's the way the preacher preaches to them I want to tell you how many want to hear what a prophet want to tell you I want to tell you a godsent holy ghost born preacher won't compromise with any congregation I will not compromise with any congregation do you know why cuz America no because I'm a no ad all no I think I'm the least I'm I'm I'm the I'm the second Chief of Sinners and I would have taken Chief but Paul already claimed it so I got to take second Chief Hallelujah but I am Holy Ghost sent I am Holy Ghost filled and I'm not here to compromise on the word of God friends we almost home we're too close it's too late oh what a day that we're living in like the day of joash border line halfway lukewarm blowing away tossed about winds clouds Without Rain tossed about never learning brother B says never learning able to come to the knowledge of the truth don't be tossed about by everything will you accept the counsel of a prophet tonight don't don't be tossed about by everything don't let the allurements young people don't let the allurements of the world draw you aside don't don't let that happen get on your knees call on the name of the Lord ask the Lord to increase your faith increase your courage feel you if you if you need an actx to experience seek it if you need an ax for refilling seek it amen see don't be tossed about by everything don't be that guy Brothers don't be tossed about by what you seen on the television why some Christians today are staying home on Wednesday night to see the television you know that's true why you know that's the gate way of all Hollywood out there why it's nothing else but a bunch of big prostitution and some of the vulgar watch him now and Elijah Eli Elisha said go get your bow and he put an arrow in and said open the window towards the east the East is the way that Jesus will come and he said now watch now I want you to put the arrow in the place and draw back as far as you can and he did it he said shoot and when he shot what happened the arrow went out he said get the arrow and when he come back said Strike It On The Ground he struck the ground three times and the prophet was wroth with him and said why' you why' you strike it why' you strike it more times than that why didn't you do something else about it strike it more times said you Struck it three times which you'll only have three victories a lot of times friends we don't have enough Victory CU we don't strike it enough times I say strike it and strike it again and again and again and again say I already pray pray more read my Bible read more I come to church go more I Fellowship Fellowship more see this backslid King says you'll you Struck it three times you'll only have three victories I already know I don't want to be this guy I already know that say he was a king I don't care what is he now brother brandham actually connects this story in the Old Testament as a type to the modern church today and connects it to the upper room that Arrow of Deliverance see he says the same the same's happening tonight in the Christian church we have struck the arrow of God's Deliverance he said it was God sent the arrow of Deliverance to us the arrow of Deliverance is the holy spirit that's been sent shot from the bow of God's love isn't that a beautiful way to say it shot from the bow of God's love when the eternity to Eternity was pulled together by the cord of love he shot the arrow of Deliverance into the church on the day of Pentecost amen the church was given into her hand the Arrow of God's Deliverance you have it in your hand don't don't be like the Rich Young Ruler don't squander it don't be like joash don't just strike three times don't whatever you do don't be like like Judas don't be like lot you're not supposed to be lot you're supposed to be up there with Abraham he says the holy spirit will deliver the church out of any kind of chaos it could get into but what does it do with it they picked up the arrow and they struck three times that's a backsliding king they struck the arrow once well we'll build a church that's all right they strike the arrow we'll teach theology that's all right well strike the arrow we'll teach psychology and have an organization that's just about as far as you struck they struck short of many blessings listen now and the church tonight hear me this is what a prophet is saying hear me the church tonight is still striking short the church has struck short of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it struck short of deliverance from sin it struck short I don't want to be that church Hallelujah I don't want to strike short I don't want to strike short of the Holy Ghost short of Divine Healing short of Deliverance come on Friends is that your desire tonight say Lord we're not here to strike short I want to I want to fire it till the enemy is destroyed destroyed in my life destroyed in my family destroyed in my home Hallelujah I don't want to be brother brandham says says he says it it struck short of deliverance from sin it struck short tell you something friends I don't want to be a lukewarm believer even if I am a direct descendant of David even if I am even if I am a direct descendant of David even if I am a child of Abraham even if I've got the even if I've got a gene of God I don't want to strike short I don't want to Paul said these stories are for our admonition that we don't fall into the same problems I don't want to be that man I don't want to be that man at all I don't want to be for men who had a chance say brother Jason you've pretty much eliminated every kind of man there is pray tell what kind of a man would you rather be I thought about that today and I made a decision rather than be like any one of these four men I'd rather be an old Infidel almost gone from the world living way back in the hills of Kentucky sitting under an apple tree minding my own business and have the one and only Ministry come along that could open up my eyes that friends is what I would like to be I'll take that over following Jesus for In the Flesh for three and a half years as a make believer I'll take that over being a rich young powerful businessman ready to tear down my Barns and build build big ones I'll take that I'll take that over being a backslid king I'll take that over being the nephew of God's Prophet only to prove in the end that I'm just a foolish virgin living in Sodom without the courage to stand on God's word I'll take that I'll be an old Infidel sitting under an apple tree and the one Ministry that can finally open my eyes comes my way Hallelujah friends I think about a man who was a true son of the Living God God a true son of the Living God now you you probably can't see it up close how it happened I'll never know this is a AI image and all I did was tell it give it the prompt how it put a man in that rocking chair that looks like brother brandom with a rod in his hand I will never know but I thought of this before I did that I'll tell you that and I would rather I know I I I I I I would rather be a man that's a true son of the Living God and have I mean here's a man who who never knew who he was never never I mean here he is he's a true son of the Living God he's lived his whole life he's a true son of the Living God and had never known that about himself he had never even known God at all he didn't didn't know who he was he didn't know about God he didn't even believe that there was a God he was completely unaware of the creator of all things he was unaware that his father was the king of the universe He was unaware he I mean h h how is that even possible for a Son of God who's an elected child of God who a prophet's going to go catch him in his old age and the very next year when brother brandham comes back and he tells a story of leadership he said I come back the next year and said he was already he was gone and said I went hunting and come back and there was his wife and she gave me a right good ball and out said oh you you Indiana's people you think you can just come over here and run all over us kuckian and he said well lady if you just give me a chance he said I I thought I had permission you do not have permission who gave you permission he says well I I don't know exactly he said he was an old guy and he was sitting out back there under that apple tree and and I started talking to him about God Hand That same tree and she dropped it and she said are you brother brandom he said yes she said I'm sorry she said I didn't know who you were she said let me give you his testimony brother brandom said he died with his hands up in the air shouting he died with his hands up in the air shouting he brother R him said he knew just the same God that took that sap down in the tree and took those apples off but brought them back up he said he knew on Resurrection he'll come back around I want to be that guy hallelujah oh I want to be that guy that's that's who I want to be today I want to be a man like Abraham who looked for a city which hath Foundation who Builder and maker is God I want to be a man like Moses who refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season what kind of a woman do you want to be sisters today by faith the Harlot Rahab perish not with them that believe not by faith women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had Trials of cruel mockings and scourgings yet moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were swn aund they were tempted were slain with a sword they wondered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy I'm here to tell you something sisters wear your Christianity with pride the world is not even worthy of you Hallelujah and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect I want to tell you something friends all you have to do tonight is reach up and take a hold of that kind of possession reach up and take a hold of every promise and say Lord that's the kind of man I want to be that's the kind of sister I want to be that's the kind of family I want to have is that your desire friends that's my desire that's my whole heart to you and I thought about it I looked at that picture and I thought four men who had a chance and took it how many want to take it tonight we saw four men who had a chance and squandered it four men who had a chance and took it I want to take it you want to take it w you now I ask you at the beginning I ask you again will the real family of God please stand up oh friends are you glad to be a part of the family of God hallelujah born of his Spirit washed in his blood think about the privilege that we have today you can you can uh take that down now oh sister Ester thank you amen let's come brother Kenny bring your team we'll sing We got some prayer requests to go to you know it became such a reality to me when I thought about the opportunity that these men had and how do you how do you walk with the Lord three and a half years and all along you're making decisions of betrayal that eventually lead you to that let me tell you something friend brothers that that those kind of decisions aren't made overnight Satan leads you down a path and as I said at the very beginning I am sure that along the way those imperceptible moments when Judas was kept making the the same decision that kept taking him in the right direction I mean in the in the direction that he would end up with in the wrong direction and you know what God rich in Mercy gave him a chance you have a chance tonight if you find yourself Brothers if you find yourself in any area of your life now you think with me for a moment if you find yourself sisters if you find yourself in any area of your life and you can see that your decisions are compounding one on top of another and every time you make the next one you get a little further away from God a little closer to the world why don't you reverse course tonight why don't you raise up a hand and say Lord God help me put Power put strength in me Spin Me Turn Me flip me whatever you got to do set me on the path of righteousness set me in the right direction Lord I I know where those decisions lead me don't be like the Rich Young Ruler and and everything he wanted everything of the world and even Jesus loved him but he turned down brother brandham said he turned down the leadership of eternal life I think about lot I get that he's a foolish virgin but I don't want to be a foolish virgin I want to go in the first resurrection C I want to be part of that number on that morning as brother Brown says on that morning oh on that morning friends that morning is breaking soon bright and fair I don't care what's happening in the world on that morning it's going to be a victory day for us hallelujah I don't I I I I don't want to be a king I say well he was a king I don't I wouldn't want to be a king of Israel I want to be a king of Any Nation and be backslid away from from God why would I want to be an Earthly King with all of that and it's just temporary and I'm already Kings and priest unto God I'm already got got victory over the
