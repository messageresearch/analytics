[44:14] know you you know you've preached a few
[44:16] times and you know i really i i really
[44:18] feel like this is you know led to the
[44:20] lord to do so
[44:21] and
[44:22] he said so just any time that you have a
[44:24] burden on your heart you just just let
[44:25] me know and we're going to go forward
[44:26] with it and i thought
[44:28] wow
[44:29] i don't want to do that
[44:32] i would way rather be out there with you
[44:34] all
[44:35] uh as jeremiah so originally said it in
[44:38] jeremiah 20 9
[44:41] then i said i will not make mention of
[44:42] him nor speak any more in his name
[44:45] and that's
[44:46] that's what it says but his word was in
[44:48] my heart as a burning fire shut up in my
[44:51] bones glory to god and i was i was weary
[44:54] with forbearing and i could not stay
[44:56] friends that's that was fire shut up in
[44:59] my bones so here i am amen
[45:01] thank god good last time we spoke to you
[45:03] we were
[45:04] we were talking about learning how to be
[45:06] completely submissive to the the
[45:08] leadership of the holy spirit i think
[45:09] that that's a a
[45:12] a vital thing in every believer's life
[45:14] and it's not just a subject you take as
[45:16] a text it's a lifelong thing that you
[45:18] have to live
[45:19] we went through some examples and
[45:20] scriptures with gideon and paul and with
[45:22] brother branham just showing that no
[45:24] matter how much of a veteran christian
[45:25] or how new of a christian that you are
[45:28] in your walk that finding the mind of
[45:30] christ and surrendering to his will and
[45:32] everything is an everyday occurrence
[45:34] it's it's not even an everyday
[45:36] occurrence it's an every minute
[45:37] occurrence i mean we have to every
[45:39] everything that we do we need to find
[45:41] the mind of christ and it's in times
[45:43] that that we don't know his mind that
[45:45] we're learning the most from it the
[45:47] times of waiting is where i find that i
[45:49] learn the most amen
[45:51] we have to search for his direction at
[45:53] every avenue
[45:55] you know as a christian it's like coming
[45:57] to a crossroad but as believers that
[45:59] crossroad happens every day for each one
[46:00] of us
[46:02] an everyday experience and it's
[46:04] absolutely vital
[46:05] not just in the big decisions like we
[46:07] were talking about last time but in
[46:09] every decision amen
[46:12] god really is the best teacher
[46:15] he'll never
[46:16] he'll always be training you in
[46:18] situations
[46:20] and you don't even know that you're in
[46:21] training
[46:23] brother branham picks up a quote
[46:25] uh or
[46:26] picks up a in spiritual adoption 1956.
[46:28] he said we can't look for sympathy and
[46:30] be sympathized with too much we must
[46:32] listen to child training
[46:35] of our father he knows what's best amen
[46:37] he knows what's best sometimes we say
[46:39] when the gospel is being preached oh
[46:41] thank you brother oh i'll just go to my
[46:43] church oh yeah i'll just believe it this
[46:44] way but remember the holy spirit knows
[46:47] best amen it knows how to train you
[46:50] sometimes it takes the stick to correct
[46:52] you
[46:53] you must remember god made the child
[46:55] trainer for the chur for the church and
[46:58] he loves the father and he'll always
[47:01] point to the father amen
[47:03] it doesn't always feel so good when it's
[47:06] time for a little bit of correction in
[47:08] our lives
[47:09] i know that i've been at times in my
[47:11] life where i've been at a crossroads and
[47:13] needing to make a decision and and the
[47:15] lord needed to correct me in something
[47:16] and it didn't feel so good it doesn't
[47:18] always feel good but
[47:21] i always want to be corrected amen and
[47:24] we should always as the holy spirit led
[47:25] christians we should always heed to that
[47:27] correction in everything that we do
[47:30] um in everything that we say and
[47:31] everything that we think we have to he
[47:33] allows us to go through certain tests
[47:35] and trials
[47:36] you know we can't we
[47:38] thinking about back in the book of job
[47:40] you know he had a uh
[47:42] building built around job he said have
[47:44] you considered my servant job and
[47:48] satan said i can't get to him you have
[47:50] it's too hard
[47:51] he said you can do everything but kill
[47:53] him god god literally will allow these
[47:56] things in our lives to make us stronger
[47:58] amen friends so that we can reach our
[48:01] full potential as believers and i don't
[48:04] know about you all but i really want to
[48:05] reach my full potential as a believer
[48:07] amen glory to god i don't want to be
[48:09] drug along the finish line holding
[48:12] myself or anybody else back i want to go
[48:15] forward amen
[48:17] tonight we're going to take a topic on
[48:19] the courage conference it came to me
[48:21] when um
[48:23] i was listening to a a sermon by the
[48:26] prophet on conferences he preaches it
[48:28] many times but i just wanted to be to
[48:30] begin tonight by exploring a really
[48:32] familiar story a sunday school story
[48:34] that we're all very familiar with but i
[48:36] want to go through it so it's fresh in
[48:38] our minds amen and we don't have to turn
[48:40] to it if um but it's in the book of
[48:42] esther
[48:43] so esther won
[48:45] this was a time when king hasawaris was
[48:48] was at the uh was at the throne he was
[48:50] the kingdom uh the king of a great
[48:52] kingdom at the time and the king was
[48:54] having a banquet a great feast in his
[48:56] throne and wanted to show off the queen
[48:58] we're just going to go through just a
[48:59] quick synopsis so it's fresh in our
[49:00] minds
[49:01] he asked the queen uh at the time which
[49:03] was vashti um to come
[49:06] before him to so that he could show her
[49:08] show her beauty to his
[49:10] you know to his kingdom
[49:12] and the king got together and and she
[49:15] refused that commandment she refused to
[49:16] go before him she humiliated him so the
[49:19] kings got together the king got together
[49:21] with all of his counsels and and
[49:23] discussed
[49:24] what uh what the law was on this matter
[49:27] and um and and what should be done and
[49:30] if there anything can be done or what i
[49:31] need to do and the wise men knew that if
[49:34] if the king didn't do anything that the
[49:36] circumstance would set a terrible
[49:38] precedent in the land for the whole
[49:40] kingdom and throughout and then so
[49:42] chapter two is when when esther is
[49:44] mentioned
[49:45] um
[49:46] and the law was set that vashti was was
[49:49] dethroned and that the they would they
[49:51] needed to go into all the land and find
[49:54] a fair young virgin sought for the king
[49:57] and it was a process it was a process
[49:58] that they had to go through they were
[50:00] set underneath the king's chamberlain
[50:02] hagiai or haggy h-e-g-e is how the king
[50:05] james says it
[50:07] and
[50:09] how whoever was it to please the king
[50:12] that would become the queen
[50:14] and we find that esther
[50:16] finds favor in the sight of the
[50:18] chamberlains she finds favor in the
[50:20] sight of the king's servants
[50:24] and all things were given to her it says
[50:26] that all things were given to her
[50:28] speedily all the best things were given
[50:30] to esther she was put at the front of
[50:32] the line
[50:33] esther
[50:34] we go on to further to read and we find
[50:36] that esther did doesn't tell anybody
[50:38] that she's a jew
[50:40] she kept that a secret her uncle
[50:42] mordecai told her that you know you're a
[50:45] jew you don't don't tell anybody this so
[50:47] when it was esther's turn to go before
[50:49] the king you know after the process the
[50:51] purification process
[50:53] she
[50:56] she only took and this is a beautiful
[50:58] thing and it can a whole sermon can be
[51:00] preached on this but it's not the
[51:01] subject tonight she only took what the
[51:04] king's chamberlain suggested
[51:07] somebody that was so close to the king
[51:09] that knew exactly what he
[51:11] what he liked what he favored she only
[51:14] took that all the other all the other
[51:16] women they took they took these nice
[51:18] long robes and these nice necklaces and
[51:20] this nice perfume but no the only thing
[51:23] that esther wanted was
[51:25] what the king liked what what was
[51:27] pleasing to the king amen and that's i
[51:30] mean it's beautiful but we're gonna
[51:31] we're gonna keep going amen in chapter
[51:33] three we find the conspiracy of of haman
[51:37] um
[51:39] haman was
[51:41] came to be known as the second in the
[51:42] kingdom
[51:43] he had such a hate in his heart for
[51:45] mordecai and the jews and we find that
[51:47] we find out because the reason that he
[51:49] had this hate in his heart was because
[51:51] that he was a descendant of the
[51:53] amalekites which were
[51:55] israel's
[51:57] uh enemy for generations
[51:59] so he was an enemy of the queen amen but
[52:03] he didn't know that at the time
[52:05] he persuaded the king that that there
[52:08] was a
[52:09] he persuaded the king that the jews were
[52:12] or that there was a certain people that
[52:14] weren't following his law and his
[52:16] statutes correctly so he tells the king
[52:19] that you need to
[52:21] set a law in order that the all of these
[52:23] people be killed amen
[52:25] so the king obviously in his you know
[52:29] he had a lot of advisers coming to him
[52:30] for a lot of different things he had a
[52:32] lot of
[52:33] of responsibility so when somebody comes
[52:36] before the king and says that you have
[52:38] somebody that doesn't respect your
[52:40] throne he obviously gave him authority
[52:43] he gave him the authority to go ahead
[52:45] and send the order
[52:46] further
[52:47] so
[52:50] he was sly haman was sly he was cunning
[52:52] in his in his deceitfulness amen just
[52:55] like the devil is sometimes amen
[52:57] haman said it in order and he sends out
[52:59] the decree out to all the kingdom and
[53:01] all the jews that they were to be killed
[53:04] on a certain day at a certain time and
[53:06] that all the women all the men and all
[53:09] the children all of the kingdoms of the
[53:10] medes and persias
[53:14] and verse 15 of chapter three we don't
[53:16] need to turn but it says that the people
[53:18] were perplexed
[53:20] they had one of their own people in the
[53:23] kingdom now they knew that that esther
[53:25] was a jew she still hadn't told anybody
[53:28] but but they knew that she was a jew and
[53:30] there was a there was a great uh a great
[53:33] they were on a great mountaintop they
[53:34] were having a mountaintop experience
[53:36] they had somebody in the kingdom to
[53:38] but what happened is that the enemy came
[53:41] in and now their lives are on the line
[53:44] not just not just their family's life
[53:46] not just their their food and their
[53:48] shelter but their whole entire lives
[53:50] were on the line amen and we find out in
[53:52] chapter four that esther finds out about
[53:55] what heyman had done and she doesn't
[53:57] know exactly what to do
[53:59] her people are going to be slaughtered
[54:01] in a matter matter of weeks and the only
[54:03] authority able to stop or or to do
[54:05] anything about it is the king amen
[54:08] but the queen at that point in time
[54:10] could not enter into the inner court
[54:12] without being called amen so you know
[54:14] it's it's fresh in our minds and we're
[54:15] just thinking about that story we're
[54:17] gonna
[54:18] we're gonna we're gonna shift a little
[54:20] bit but i want you guys to keep that
[54:21] fresh in your mind that she was
[54:23] desperate and she had a need and it was
[54:25] about time to call a conference amen i
[54:28] want to pick up in acts the fourth
[54:30] chapter in verses one and
[54:32] one through four and as they spake unto
[54:34] the people the priests and the captains
[54:37] of the people and the sadducees that
[54:39] came upon them being grieved that they
[54:41] taught the people and preached through
[54:42] jesus the resurrection from the dead
[54:45] they laid hands on them
[54:47] and put them in hold they put them in
[54:49] prison until the next day for it was
[54:51] even tied it was late at night how be it
[54:54] many of them which heard the word
[54:57] believed and the number of men was about
[55:00] five thousand this is what king the king
[55:03] james version describes as the first
[55:05] persecution since the since the
[55:08] ascension of jesus back into heaven and
[55:10] we don't have to turn there but i want
[55:12] to just take a background of what what
[55:14] led up to this series of events and what
[55:16] was taking place in acts chapter 3 peter
[55:19] and john filled with the holy ghost we
[55:21] know it happens at pentecost they were
[55:22] filled with the baptism of the holy
[55:24] ghost they were all together gathered
[55:26] together in one accord and now in
[55:28] chapter 3 peter and john are just
[55:29] walking they're walking through the gate
[55:32] and a man that had been there his whole
[55:34] life
[55:36] ever since that he was able to go there
[55:38] was at the gate and the gate was called
[55:40] beautiful and he was crippled and he was
[55:42] asking for alms he was asking for money
[55:45] and peter and john came up and it says
[55:48] that he laid every every single day
[55:49] there he was begging and laying but
[55:51] peter and john they were filled with the
[55:53] holy ghost and they said
[55:55] unto this man verse six silver and gold
[55:57] have i none but such as i have i give
[56:00] unto thee amen friends such as i have i
[56:03] give unto thee peter took him by the
[56:05] hand he didn't just say the word and
[56:07] then expect it to happen he took him by
[56:09] the hand he lifted up his hand and said
[56:12] and it says that his ankle bones
[56:13] immediately received strength amen
[56:16] praise god this and this is what they
[56:18] show in the king james i really love how
[56:20] they have this study study bible but the
[56:22] this was known as the first apostolic
[56:25] miracle since the ascension of jesus
[56:27] glory amen verse 8 shows the man leaping
[56:31] and running amen friends when we get a
[56:33] healing in our lives when we have
[56:35] something has happened that that has
[56:37] infected our lives for years and years
[56:39] i'll just say right now glory to god i'm
[56:42] able to drink coffee and sleep sleep
[56:44] flat at night because i don't have any
[56:46] stomach problems anymore because god
[56:48] healed me of that he healed me of that
[56:50] amen friends when i first gave my heart
[56:52] to the lord i was having heart problems
[56:54] i didn't know what was going on just
[56:55] palpitations he healed me of that he
[56:58] delivered me of that each one of us
[56:59] could have a testimony each one of us do
[57:01] have a testimony tonight that whatever
[57:03] it is the
[57:04] the the the devil fought us with or that
[57:07] god allowed in our lives to oh to give
[57:09] us overcoming power we we feel like this
[57:12] man because he lived his whole life like
[57:14] that he lived his whole life not being
[57:16] able to stand and not being able to walk
[57:18] and just crippled if i had if i wasn't
[57:21] able to walk if if i couldn't if i
[57:23] couldn't physically do anything for
[57:25] myself and a man came up to me and said
[57:27] in the name of jesus christ you are
[57:29] whole and he took me by the hand and he
[57:31] raised me up and my ankle bones i
[57:34] watched them it was just crooked and i
[57:36] washed him straightened out glory to god
[57:38] i would be praising the lord i'd be
[57:39] jumping up and down i'd be looking crazy
[57:41] that day glory who wants to look crazy
[57:44] with me because i'm healed we're all
[57:45] healed amen they it caused a great
[57:48] uproar it caused a great stir among the
[57:50] place they said that they were in the
[57:52] place called solomon's porch which is a
[57:54] very interesting fact because it was
[57:56] it's really cool solomon's porch was
[57:59] actually what solomon had built years
[58:01] and years ago and it had been destroyed
[58:03] and then rebuilt and now they were in
[58:05] that place called solomon's porch and
[58:07] the man went around and they it ran
[58:10] together into the porch and it caused an
[58:12] uproar in acts 2 and verse 41
[58:17] it says that about 3 000 souls at that
[58:20] point had been baptized and given their
[58:22] hearts to the lord because of this
[58:24] experience with this man and his ankle
[58:26] bones and he's just running and praising
[58:28] god it says that in acts 4 4 that about
[58:32] 5 000 souls were given to the lord
[58:34] that's 2 000 souls that gave their heart
[58:37] to the lord because of something that
[58:39] happened because of what jesus did glory
[58:41] to god it caused it caused peter to just
[58:45] have a fire in his bones he had a fire
[58:48] oh he just had something burning inside
[58:50] of him he just has started to preach the
[58:51] gospel it says that he started to preach
[58:53] in verse 13 that the god of abraham and
[58:56] of isaac and of jacob the god of our
[58:58] fathers hath glorified his son jesus now
[59:01] this is axe sermon i like plagiarizing
[59:04] out of the word this was a sermon from
[59:06] another guy but i'm plagiarizing it out
[59:08] of the word the god of our fathers hath
[59:10] glorified his son jesus whom ye
[59:13] delivered up and ye denied him in the
[59:15] presence of pilate when he was
[59:16] determined to let him go but ye denied
[59:19] the holy one and the just and desired a
[59:22] murderer instead to be granted unto you
[59:24] and he's just preaching at him just
[59:26] preaching to him preaching at him and he
[59:28] said in verse 15 and he killed the
[59:30] prince of life whom god hath raised from
[59:32] the dead whereof we are witnesses repent
[59:35] ye therefore
[59:37] and be converted
[59:39] because your sins so that your sins may
[59:41] be blotted out when the time of
[59:43] refreshing shall come from the presence
[59:45] of the lord verse 22 for moses truly
[59:48] said unto our fathers now this is just
[59:49] snippets from his sermon a prophet shall
[59:51] the lord your god raise up unto your
[59:53] brother and like unto me and him shall
[59:55] ye hear in all things whatsoever he
[59:57] shall say unto you and it came to pass
[1:00:00] in verse 23 that every soul which will
[1:00:02] not hear the prophet shall be destroyed
[1:00:04] from among the people 2 000 people gave
[1:00:07] their hearts to the lord that day
[1:00:09] because of this sermon that he preached
[1:00:10] and it caused it up great uproar so we
[1:00:12] get to chapter uh we get to chapter four
[1:00:15] in the first four verses of what we
[1:00:17] opened with and we see that obviously
[1:00:20] the sadducees and the captains of the
[1:00:22] temple were not happy at what was going
[1:00:24] on friends the devil is not happy when
[1:00:26] we have victory they our enemy hates it
[1:00:29] when we have victory but when we've got
[1:00:31] the holy ghost and we're healed it
[1:00:33] doesn't matter what he says or what he
[1:00:35] thinks we've got the victory glory to
[1:00:37] god and they spake under the temple and
[1:00:39] the sadducees and they were grieved it
[1:00:42] says in verse two being grieved that
[1:00:43] they taught the people and they preached
[1:00:45] through the resurrection through jesus
[1:00:47] the resurrection of the dead amen
[1:00:49] friends i was preached the resurrection
[1:00:51] of the dead and i gave heed to my jesus
[1:00:53] and i gave him oh glory to god and they
[1:00:56] laid hands on him and they put him in
[1:00:58] hold until the next day for it was even
[1:01:00] tied friends they put him
[1:01:02] they put him in prison they beat him
[1:01:03] they put him in prison and the next day
[1:01:05] it says that they brought him
[1:01:08] they brought them before
[1:01:10] the council
[1:01:12] friends
[1:01:13] a lot of times i look at this story
[1:01:16] and i so identified with it because
[1:01:18] what we're going to notice here what
[1:01:20] we're going to see is is that from
[1:01:22] chapter 3 to chapter 6
[1:01:24] there's mountaintops high mountaintops
[1:01:26] wow and then there's valleys and there's
[1:01:29] low valleys i mean low valleys you go
[1:01:32] from preaching a sermon and watching 2
[1:01:34] 000 people give their hearts to the lord
[1:01:35] to being beaten and put in prison and
[1:01:37] brought before a council because you
[1:01:40] just because for what for what reason am
[1:01:42] i brought before this council peter says
[1:01:44] for what reason
[1:01:46] because i have
[1:01:47] because i preached in the name of jesus
[1:01:49] because i had a man because a man was
[1:01:51] healed because
[1:01:52] for what reason and it says that so just
[1:01:55] think about put your put your uh self in
[1:01:57] their shoes for a minute these were
[1:01:59] these were apostles but they were also
[1:02:01] men and women just like us and they
[1:02:03] fought the same battles that we're
[1:02:05] facing and they had ups and downs just
[1:02:07] like us and there was mountains and
[1:02:09] valleys amen friends
[1:02:10] we can go through that and it says in
[1:02:12] verse eight
[1:02:13] so in verse six and seven and that he
[1:02:15] went before him and in verse eight it
[1:02:16] said that he was filled with the holy
[1:02:18] ghost again and ye rulers of the people
[1:02:20] and he preached to get into him and he
[1:02:21] says be it known unto you to all the
[1:02:23] people um we're get we're going to
[1:02:25] paraphrase a little bit so you don't
[1:02:26] have to follow up there but be it known
[1:02:28] unto you all to all the people of israel
[1:02:30] that jesus the name of jesus of nazareth
[1:02:32] hath raised christ from the dead
[1:02:35] this is the stone which was set at not
[1:02:37] of you builders which is become the head
[1:02:40] of the corner amen and neither is there
[1:02:42] salvation in any other for there is none
[1:02:45] other name under heaven given among men
[1:02:48] whereby ye must be saved amen friends it
[1:02:50] said that they spoke in the next verse
[1:02:52] that says that they saw the boldness of
[1:02:55] peter and john and that they perceived
[1:02:56] that they were unlearned ignorant men
[1:02:58] but they perceived and they marveled
[1:03:01] that they had been with jesus friends i
[1:03:04] want to have that attitude i want to
[1:03:05] have not that attitude i want to have
[1:03:07] that that persona that when somebody
[1:03:09] sees me they know that i've been with
[1:03:11] jesus wherever i go with whatever i do
[1:03:14] however i act i want them to know that
[1:03:17] i've been with god because i can't do it
[1:03:19] by myself it says that
[1:03:21] he had to be filled with the holy ghost
[1:03:23] in verse eight he had to be filled with
[1:03:25] the spirit he was already filled with
[1:03:27] the spirit why was he filled with the
[1:03:28] spirit again because we are go through
[1:03:30] mountaintops and low valleys glory to
[1:03:33] god amen so when they saw that they were
[1:03:35] they marveled and they they they saw
[1:03:37] they were ignorant men and they marveled
[1:03:39] they took note that they had been with
[1:03:41] jesus
[1:03:42] and uh they go it goes forward and and
[1:03:45] he just keeps preaching between verses
[1:03:47] uh 13 to 22 and they went before and
[1:03:50] they uh beholding the man was healed
[1:03:52] they could say nothing against it
[1:03:55] um
[1:04:02] 16 and verse 16 sorry i was trying to
[1:04:03] find it they could not and it says that
[1:04:05] we cannot deny it friends they
[1:04:08] there was nothing to deny someone
[1:04:10] everybody saw that man and his ankles
[1:04:12] and his feet and his crippledness at the
[1:04:14] gate of beautiful every day for the last
[1:04:18] 10 years they 15 years they watched him
[1:04:21] every single day they couldn't deny the
[1:04:23] fact that now he's jumping and praising
[1:04:25] the lord they couldn't deny the fact
[1:04:27] that two 2 000 more now 5 000 had given
[1:04:31] their lives to god and received the holy
[1:04:33] ghost they couldn't deny that fact but
[1:04:35] peter and john answered and they're
[1:04:37] preaching to him for but verse 20 we
[1:04:40] cannot but speak the things which we
[1:04:41] have seen and heard i can't speak unto
[1:04:44] you friends i couldn't come up and come
[1:04:46] up and say anything to you if i didn't
[1:04:48] have an experience of jesus christ amen
[1:04:51] friends brother jason dimar sent a
[1:04:53] wonderful verse to me or a wonderful
[1:04:54] quote he says that people can have
[1:04:56] experiences of everything we you can
[1:04:58] have an experience of anything but it's
[1:05:00] until you have the experience of jesus
[1:05:03] christ that it becomes a reality to each
[1:05:05] one of us and that's and then and only
[1:05:08] then can we express jesus christ to
[1:05:10] others you can't be a witness if you
[1:05:12] don't have an experience yourself glory
[1:05:14] to god amen friends i've had an
[1:05:16] experience who's with me amen friends
[1:05:18] and if you haven't you can have one
[1:05:20] tonight amen so they we cannot speak but
[1:05:23] the things that we which we had seen and
[1:05:25] heard and when they had further
[1:05:26] threatened them they let them go finding
[1:05:30] nothing
[1:05:30] how they might punish him because of the
[1:05:34] people because of the five thousand
[1:05:36] because of the people that were there
[1:05:38] they knew that if they could if they
[1:05:40] sent him to prison if they stoned him if
[1:05:42] they beat him anymore they knew that it
[1:05:43] would cause an uproar or cause a riot
[1:05:46] and so they just said
[1:05:47] go on your way but they threatened them
[1:05:49] and they said that you're not um
[1:05:52] i don't know what we
[1:05:54] whatever verse it was they said you're
[1:05:56] not allowed to speak they threatened him
[1:05:58] they said that they threatened him you
[1:05:59] are not allowed to speak in the name of
[1:06:01] jesus anymore
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:04] now friends i want to pick up where we
[1:06:06] started i guess i didn't i didn't start
[1:06:08] with acts one through four but we
[1:06:10] started with verse 23 i want to pick up
[1:06:11] at verse 23 now and i want to imagine we
[1:06:14] see things when we read the scriptures
[1:06:16] we read it in a linear way it goes up
[1:06:18] and then it down and then up and down
[1:06:19] right but when i when we look at it we
[1:06:22] need to read between the lines a little
[1:06:23] bit amen in verse 23 it says in being
[1:06:26] let go
[1:06:30] peter and john they were walking along
[1:06:32] the road that day
[1:06:34] and they just i mean two chapters
[1:06:36] earlier they just had a mountaintop
[1:06:38] experience they i mean they watched a
[1:06:41] man be healed in jesus name this was the
[1:06:42] first healing since jesus ascended so
[1:06:45] that jesus wasn't even there to do the
[1:06:47] healing but jesus was there to do the
[1:06:49] healing amen he was living inside of him
[1:06:51] they had the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:06:53] which is jesus amen so they watch that
[1:06:55] and then and then peter filled with the
[1:06:57] holy spirit preaches to him and then
[1:06:59] more 2000 more give their hearts to
[1:07:01] jesus and i can just imagine him walking
[1:07:04] down that day and
[1:07:06] i mean they were beaten they were blood
[1:07:08] was probably coming off of their
[1:07:10] eyebrows and they had just been before a
[1:07:12] council and the council was threatening
[1:07:14] them not to preach jesus anymore friends
[1:07:16] put yourself in their shoes for a minute
[1:07:18] they were in a low valley
[1:07:20] right after a mountaintop experience
[1:07:22] they were just they were in a low valley
[1:07:25] oh my goodness i can so identify with
[1:07:28] those low valleys and those high

[1:09:52] had experienced before
[1:09:54] that they knew that if they just went
[1:09:56] about their separate ways if peter just
[1:09:58] went to his house and john just went to
[1:09:59] his house and they just you know well

[1:11:53] conference before god friends i just
[1:11:54] want to turn our minds now back to
[1:11:56] esther and and just to show a little bit
[1:11:58] of drama esther finds herself in this
[1:12:00] situation she was just living just
[1:12:03] living on a mountaintop she was a jew
[1:12:05] and she had to she was taken from her
[1:12:07] family or from her uncle and then she
[1:12:09] was brought before and she it was
[1:12:12] possible that she wasn't going to be
[1:12:13] queen and then she was maybe never going
[1:12:14] to go back to her family and there was
[1:12:16] just all these possibilities but what
[1:12:18] happened
[1:12:19] she she was chosen amen she was chosen
[1:12:22] to be the queen we're chosen to be the
[1:12:24] bride she was chosen to be the bride
[1:12:26] amen but she was just living on that
[1:12:28] mountaintop she she was favored above
[1:12:31] all
[1:12:32] above all and chosen to be
[1:12:34] chosen to be queen of the greatest of
[1:12:36] all the land at the time
[1:12:38] but she found herself beaten down
[1:12:42] and the only place to look was to god
[1:12:45] she didn't know what to do in just a few
[1:12:47] short weeks her people were going to be
[1:12:49] slaughtered and the only way to help
[1:12:52] was to ask the king
[1:12:54] but if if she went before the king the
[1:12:57] law was that she would be killed
[1:12:58] uncalled
[1:13:00] so she called a conference
[1:13:02] amen
[1:13:03] she said mordecai go tell all the jews
[1:13:05] fast for three days and i and all my
[1:13:08] servants will fast too they we don't
[1:13:11] have to bear the burden alone friends we
[1:13:13] are we have a group galatians 6 2 says
[1:13:15] bear one another's burdens and so

[1:13:19] law i want to know about it so we have
[1:13:21] to fulfill his law and bear one
[1:13:23] another's burdens that doesn't just mean
[1:13:26] and
[1:13:27] i've done this i've been guilty of it
[1:13:28] but that's that doesn't just mean saying
[1:13:30] i'll pray for you brother that means
[1:13:32] that we take the burden from them if
[1:13:35] it's a hundred pounds we take it with
[1:13:37] them and it's 50 50 now we we put
[1:13:40] ourselves in the shoes of what that
[1:13:42] burden is happening

[1:13:49] different struggles we all have
[1:13:51] different past failures we all have
[1:13:53] different things that we're struggling
[1:13:54] with and one may not understand the
[1:13:56] other but if you just stop for a minute

[1:14:30] i want to transition now back back to
[1:14:32] acts 4. sorry i'm kind of going back and
[1:14:34] forth but it says that they went to
[1:14:37] their own company
[1:14:39] they went to their own company in verse
[1:14:40] 23. where are we at tonight
[1:14:43] we are in our own company glory to god
[1:14:46] we are in our own company they had
[1:14:48] brothers and sisters that went to the
[1:14:51] church
[1:14:53] with them that sat among the same pews
[1:14:55] that they sat on
[1:14:57] and they remember having an experience
[1:15:01] just just a few weeks earlier
[1:15:03] and they
[1:15:05] they remember that brother brennan picks
[1:15:07] it up and so what did they do they
[1:15:08] caught they remembered back to a
[1:15:11] previous conference that they had
[1:15:13] brother ben picks it up and he calls it
[1:15:14] the pentecostal conference glory to god
[1:15:16] and they climbed them up those little
[1:15:18] outside steps and went into the upper
[1:15:20] room where 120 people gathered little
[1:15:23] grease candle burning they didn't eat
[1:15:25] and drink for 10 days waiting what's the
[1:15:28] return of the conference it was quite a
[1:15:31] long one and they had 10 days waiting
[1:15:34] and after a while the returns came oh
[1:15:36] yes what happened when the conference
[1:15:38] return came they were all in one place
[1:15:41] with one accord and suddenly there came
[1:15:43] a sound from heaven like a mighty
[1:15:46] rushing wind it filled the room what
[1:15:48] they were sitting cloven tongues sat
[1:15:50] upon them like fire they were all filled
[1:15:52] with the holy ghost he just quote in the
[1:15:53] scriptures here friends and they began
[1:15:55] to speak in other tongues as the spirit
[1:15:56] gave them utterance this was the returns
[1:15:59] from the general's headquarters the holy
[1:16:02] spirit was to lead the church not
[1:16:04] man-made dogmas but the holy spirit that
[1:16:07] was a pentecostal conference and they
[1:16:09] remembered back to that conference now
[1:16:11] so they didn't go back to their own
[1:16:13] homes they needed to gather together
[1:16:15] they had a burden at stake they said you
[1:16:17] can't preach in the name of jesus you
[1:16:19] yeah i don't care how bold you thought
[1:16:21] you were you can't do this i don't care
[1:16:23] what you thought you you won in your
[1:16:25] battle last week whatever trial you're
[1:16:27] going through whatever you think that
[1:16:28] you won last week you
[1:16:31] it's still here you're still fighting it
[1:16:33] you're still facing it oh glory to god
[1:16:35] they called they remembered that
[1:16:36] conference we don't we know exactly how
[1:16:39] long the acts the acts 2 conference was
[1:16:41] the acts 1 conference with the pentecost
[1:16:43] 10 days we don't know how long the acts
[1:16:46] 4 conference lasted it doesn't have it
[1:16:49] doesn't have it in the scriptures but we

[1:19:00] times in our life where we're so low and
[1:19:03] just so drawn down but if we just go
[1:19:06] forward and we just read scripture to
[1:19:08] show us that we can be refilled on the
[1:19:10] daily you can be refilled he was just

[1:19:27] and john and all those others they
[1:19:28] couldn't live on that pentecostal

[1:27:28] to be witnesses how to be bold and you
[1:27:30] know we read how
[1:27:32] you know even the apostles i mean these
[1:27:34] were these were men peter brother matt
[1:27:36] told i just so enjoyed his service like
[1:27:39] we last week amen everybody and he just
[1:27:41] was talking about peter and just how you
[1:27:44] know he had such a different personality
[1:27:47] he he was he was angry at first and then
[1:27:49] it you know but he was changed when he
[1:27:51] when the holy spirit got into him he
[1:27:52] changed but peter
[1:27:55] but but all of these disciples they
[1:27:57] walked with the lord i mean these were
[1:27:59] people these were men that literally
[1:28:01] walked with jesus i mean they walked
[1:28:04] with
[1:28:05] god in flesh
[1:28:08] for three years i mean for years they
[1:28:11] did this
[1:28:12] and
[1:28:13] then three chapters later four chapters
[1:28:16] later
[1:28:17] you know they're discouraged
[1:28:19] wow
[1:28:20] they were discouraged friends they got
[1:28:23] discouraged just like we do we still
[1:28:24] have that same spirit but they i mean
[1:28:26] they walked with the lord but but they
[1:28:28] still got discouraged but what did i
[1:28:30] mean what did they do they they
[1:28:33] constantly i mean if you read the book
[1:28:35] of acts i mean constantly they're just
[1:28:38] going back to the lord they're going
[1:28:40] back to their experience they're they're
[1:28:42] getting refilled i mean constantly and
[1:28:45] the lord will train you along the way we
[1:28:47] talked about that a little bit earlier
[1:28:49] and what goes from and just bringing
[1:28:51] back that conversation you know
[1:28:54] at times like when we're when we're
[1:28:55] witnesses when we're witnessing it can
[1:28:57] be difficult and at times it can feel
[1:29:00] uncomfortable you know to bring up the
[1:29:02] lord and and it's just it can be hard i
[1:29:04] mean everybody faces that and it's they
[1:29:06] don't know how to do it and you know
[1:29:08] you know it's a process we go through a
[1:29:11] process amen
[1:29:12] and you know what did they do they asked
[1:29:14] for courage they prayed for boldness to
[1:29:16] be filled with the spirit and i just was
[1:29:18] i was at home i don't know if this is
[1:29:20] gonna help anybody or or not and i don't
[1:29:22] know if it made a difference or not but
[1:29:24] i'm just gonna i'm just gonna i was at
[1:29:25] home today and i was studying for this
[1:29:27] sermon and i was like well i don't want
[1:29:29] to just go up there and preach
[1:29:31] and and and not be able to live what i'm
[1:29:34] preaching not be able to live a
[1:29:36] courageous life and not be able to pray
[1:29:38] and ask the lord to give me courage
[1:29:40] and as i was as i was thinking that i
[1:29:43] started i was like on a i was jogging
[1:29:45] trying to get some of this energy out
[1:29:47] and i was jogging and i just came across
[1:29:49] these guys that i don't even know if
[1:29:51] they live in my neighborhood or not
[1:29:52] there was three of them and they were
[1:29:53] fishing at a pond and i just i just i
[1:29:56] was so compelled wow it was like man
[1:29:59] when the holy spirit's tugging on you
[1:30:00] it's not just a little you know draw you
[1:30:02] know little string it's a i mean it's a
[1:30:04] rope i mean he's pulling you amen and he
[1:30:07] was pulling me friends and i just kind
[1:30:09] of kept going and i was oh man okay
[1:30:11] lord sometimes that's what we do friends
[1:30:13] we you know we we keep going you know
[1:30:15] that that voice that we gotta we gotta
[1:30:18] heed to that voice
[1:30:19] and i just kept going
[1:30:21] and
[1:30:21] my neighborhood is a circle so that's
[1:30:23] difficult to do so i came around the
[1:30:26] other side
[1:30:27] and then it just was stronger and
[1:30:29] stronger and there's a way if you come
[1:30:32] in my neighborhood like this the pond is
[1:30:33] here and i was coming back this way and
[1:30:36] then there's also a path that goes
[1:30:37] around it like this and i started to do
[1:30:39] that and i just oh no can't do that and
[1:30:42] i almost got home i'll admit sometimes
[1:30:44] we
[1:30:45] you know we almost we almost get home we
[1:30:47] almost don't heed to that call but i
[1:30:48] just
[1:30:50] i felt compelled and so i went up to
[1:30:52] these guys and and not to not to try to
[1:30:55] boast or anything like because it's not
[1:30:56] like i went up there and i you know i
[1:30:57] baptized them right there but i but i
[1:31:00] there it was a pawn that would have been
[1:31:02] that would have been a great thing to do
[1:31:04] but i just asked i said hey man i would
[1:31:07] hey hey guys i was running and you know
[1:31:09] they were you know intimidating they
[1:31:10] were bigger guys and i just said hey bro
[1:31:12] or hey guys like you know i just was
[1:31:13] running i felt really compelled to come
[1:31:15] talk to you about the lord and you know
[1:31:17] uh you know are you all christians i
[1:31:18] didn't know what else to say are you all
[1:31:20] christians and they all kind of looked
[1:31:21] at me and you know at first when people
[1:31:23] you know when you're when you're
[1:31:24] approaching people they don't know what
[1:31:25] you're going to say they don't know what
[1:31:27] sometimes i mean especially these i
[1:31:28] don't know if they live in our
[1:31:29] neighborhood maybe they were thinking
[1:31:30] well man this guy needs to uh he's
[1:31:32] probably wanted to ask me to leave or
[1:31:33] something i don't know but i don't carry
[1:31:36] fish in that pond but i i went up and i
[1:31:39] just asked them that and they kind of
[1:31:40] were taken aback a little bit and they
[1:31:41] were like well one of them was like well
[1:31:43] yeah i am a christian and i was like
[1:31:45] whoa oh that praise god i just want to
[1:31:47] know i would let you know you know i'm
[1:31:49] i'm ministering tonight and you know i'm
[1:31:51] preaching on courage so i just thought
[1:31:53] i'd maybe come over here and try to and
[1:31:55] then i started stumbling over my words a
[1:31:57] little bit but i'll maybe give you a
[1:31:58] little bit of courage or
[1:32:00] get some courage whatever you know
[1:32:02] whatever
[1:32:03] and i just i i didn't know what else

[1:33:42] it was time and she
[1:33:44] she was desperate we have to come to a
[1:33:46] place where we're desperate for

[1:36:40] oh friends we gotta we gotta prepare
[1:36:43] banquet sometimes we gotta we gotta get
[1:36:46] on our knees sometimes we gotta break
[1:36:47] through in prayer sometimes it takes
[1:36:49] time sometimes it to to break through
[1:36:52] like they did at pentecost to break
[1:36:53] through they did like they did at acts
[1:36:55] it does it sometimes it doesn't happen
[1:36:57] especially in today's day and age we
[1:36:58] want everything to happen right here
[1:36:59] right now it doesn't always happen and
[1:37:02] you know i'm glad that it doesn't happen
[1:37:04] because i've learned and i we say this
[1:37:06] this is all against all human nature and
[1:37:10] we learn the most
[1:37:12] when we're waiting and i'm so glad for
[1:37:15] those times of waiting
[1:37:17] glory to god
[1:37:19] i'm so glad because i've learned so much
[1:37:21] in those times i've learned to just put
[1:37:23] my trust fully in the lord jesus to put
[1:37:25] my trust fully in him because there's
[1:37:27] nothing that i can do i can't i mean god
[1:37:30] knows he's infant in his wisdom he knows
[1:37:32] everything he knows the end from the
[1:37:34] beginning he knows exactly what we need
[1:37:36] and he knows that it's going to happen
[1:37:38] anyway so we just have to place our
[1:37:40] trust in him in every situation amen and
[1:37:43] she said she prepared the bank with that
[1:37:45] that second night but this time
[1:37:48] she had the courage she had the boldness
[1:37:51] i can imagine you know after that first
[1:37:53] night she probably went to just
[1:37:54] dramatize i don't know i i can just
[1:37:56] imagine after that first night she
[1:37:57] probably went to mordecai again said
[1:37:59] uncle the first time praying worked
[1:38:02] let's pray let's get together again tell
[1:38:04] them to fast again i need some courage
[1:38:06] some boldness this is paraphrase i don't
[1:38:08] know this isn't paraphrasing i don't
[1:38:09] know if this happened i just dramatize
[1:38:11] him i need some courage some boldness in
[1:38:12] how to address the matter
[1:38:15] and they came back the next time the
[1:38:16] next day and haman you know think in the
[1:38:18] world of himself the devil think in the
[1:38:20] world of himself
[1:38:21] just
[1:38:22] thinking that he's got you trapped in
[1:38:24] every direction heyman didn't even
[1:38:25] didn't even know she was a dude but
[1:38:27] thought that she thought that thought
[1:38:29] that he had had all the jews were going
[1:38:31] to be dead mordecai was going to be dead
[1:38:33] and he was second in the kingdom i mean
[1:38:35] everything to him was just so
[1:38:37] grand i mean he was coming to a banquet
[1:38:40] and he thought so highly of himself that
[1:38:42] that the queen would only want the king
[1:38:44] himself and haman and the devil
[1:38:46] sometimes gets in that place in our
[1:38:48] lives where you know we you know maybe
[1:38:51] have a trial that we're going through or
[1:38:52] whatever and we
[1:38:56] i
[1:38:57] he she said
[1:38:58] just like the devil
[1:39:00] just thinking that you had that he has
[1:39:02] trapped you in every direction and the
[1:39:03] king said to her this time
[1:39:05] i'll just just listen the king said to
[1:39:08] her what is your request my queen
[1:39:11] glory to god what is your request
[1:39:14] she said i and my people are to be
[1:39:17] destroyed
[1:39:18] to be slain and to perish i mean she was
[1:39:21] desperate
[1:39:23] desperate i'm desperate for you lord
[1:39:26] and the king replied who is the enemy
[1:39:29] who is doing this
[1:39:31] and what happens next is so beautiful
[1:39:34] and it spoke so heavily to my heart that
[1:39:36] i just
[1:39:37] i i took it i took it from and i'm
[1:39:40] plagiarizing another another brother
[1:39:42] brother paul lafontaine actually said
[1:39:43] this in one of his services
[1:39:45] last year sometime
[1:39:47] but it spoke to me it was so beautiful
[1:39:50] she exposed the enemy
[1:39:53] in the presence
[1:39:54] of the king
[1:39:56] glory to god sometimes we have to come
[1:40:00] before god if we've got something
[1:40:02] monumental i mean this was monumental
[1:40:04] sometimes we need to be reverent we need
[1:40:06] to watch our approach and if it's so
[1:40:09] great at trial if it's so great a burden
[1:40:11] in our lives we actually have to take it
[1:40:14] before the king and bring the enemy into
[1:40:17] the presence of the king and expose him
[1:40:19] glory to god he's exposed tonight
[1:40:22] whatever it is that you're facing he's
[1:40:24] exposed he was exposed oh glory to god
[1:40:28] hallelujah oh if we have we have
[1:40:30] something that we're facing tonight that

[1:40:56] they threatened you remember back to
[1:40:57] acts 4 those sadducees and those
[1:41:00] pharisees were threatening back oh but
[1:41:02] they exposed to their enemy if you read
[1:41:04] back down in acts 5 we don't have to
[1:41:06] turn but in acts 5 40 through 42 the
[1:41:10] apostles were beaten again they came to
[1:41:12] the same trial being persecuted for the
[1:41:15] namesake of jesus christ thrown in
