i pray that you change our hearts and desires that that our desire would to be in our passion and that which drives us would would also drive us to prayer to have a burden to pray to have a burden to

amongst us today isaiah chapter 52 and i'm going to read a familiar scripture something that the lord has just burned burning upon my heart and i'm just even leading up to the service here today that satan has battled me in my body the last two days just felt just felt horrible just had congestion and head cold but um the lord's my strength and my deliverer this morning woke up this morning feeling great and just uh inspired want to just minister what the lord has for us you believe that god is here that he's mindful of any request no matter how great how small what you might have prayed this morning what you might have prayed last night what's upon your heart amen god is just mindful of us i believe that this morning so i'd just like to take a thought here and i'd like to title this put on your strength put on your strength isaiah chapter 52 verse 1 awake and then he repeats it awake put on thy strength o zion put on thy beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down o jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck o captive daughter of zion for thus saith the lord you have sold yourself or not and you shall be redeemed without money for thus saith the lord god my people went down a four time into egypt the sojourn there and the assyrian oppressed them without calls now therefore what have i hear sayeth the lord that my people is taken away for naught that they rule they that rule over them make them to howl saith the lord and my name continually every day is blasphemed therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know in that day that i am he that doth speak behold it is i lord we thank you for the reading of your word knowing lord that it's applicable it's father even no matter what situation your family finds themselves in today your word meets the challenge of the hour every situation lord every today is a group gathered here that came and lord they've prepared themselves the music the singing the worship that has went forth lord and collectively we stand here lord as your children lord lifting up our hands representing needs god that we have upon our heart lord we believe that you're mindful this morning that you can do the lord above anything we could hope or think or ask this morning lord you're for us you're with us god you you're here to encourage us here to speak to us now lord may we just step aside right now and surrender our vessels lord to you each and every single person from the front row all the way to the back of the sound booth lord i pray that every heart would just be surrendered right now as we raise our hands and say lord we surrender to you right now to your spirit may father you come and speak lord your word that you would want to say move me the speaker move them the hearer out of the way and may you get the glory and everything be with our pastor this morning who's away lord even an hour or two behind us god may be going into the pulpit soon lord i pray that you would anoint him father the people the group that's there may you accomplish the purpose that you sent him for be with us now lord we ask in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated this morning thank you amen i want you just to keep your bible open there to isaiah we're going to back up just for a moment and i'm just going to uh read just a few scriptures here that uh sort of preface or give this some context it's amazing because the lord says even in isaiah chapter 49 and we're gonna i'm just gonna quote from that and you don't have to turn i don't have the verse references here but in isaiah chapter 49 god gives this god gives his children this message and you leads all the way up to isaiah 52 which we just read and we're going to go back to it but god's people are even in isaiah 52 when he's describing this daughter of zion and he's saying that you're you're groveling in the dirt you're you're on the ground and and he says and the the uncircumcised are coming in unto thee and blaspheming and it's amazing because if you go and study in the book of isaiah in chapter 49 specifically god begins to speak to them and he begins to tell them and i'm just going to quote this you don't have to turn there he says you shall no longer hunger and thirst and he says i will have mercy on you and lead you by the springs of living water for the lord will comfort his people and have mercy on all the troubled ones and this is specifically speaking to their condition that they're they're they're they're they're crying for deliverance and they're being oppressed by an oppressor and god has uh they begin to to cry out and god has responded and saying you'll no longer hunger and thirst you're no longer going to remain in darkness but he says i'll have mercy on you i'll lead you by the springs of living water and he says and and and the lord will comfort his people and have mercy on all of the troubled ones it's amazing because the voice of the lord just continues to speak to them in this darkness this isn't israel in a time of great uh uh happiness and rejoicing a revival but it's a time when they're oppressed it's a time when they're downcast and they're they've reached the bottom and they're at their wit's in and they're they're they're they're they're they're in there they're so low that they're literally uh in the dirt and laying and groveling on the ground and they're clutching this chain and and god speaks to them in isaiah and he says uh you're he says he's the the bible begins to describe them and says that they're chained about by the neck and and they're they're they've hit rock bottom they're at their very lowest and god begins to begin to speak to them and he says i'll deliver you and i'm going to have mercy upon the troubled ones and you'll no longer thirst again and you'll no longer hunger and every tear that you're you're crying and all of the anguish and all of the sorrow and everything that you're going through god says i've bottled all of your tears i've put them in a bottle david references that so beautiful and says every tear you've cried you've put them in your bottle in your book of remembrance you know the lord notices what we do humanly the lord notices what we do on a very natural level sometimes we make serving the lord such an ethereal and such a spiritual experience and no doubt there's it is a spiritual experience it is a spiritual relationship but let me just tell you sometimes serving god doesn't always feel anointed it doesn't always feel revelated it doesn't always feel like you're you're you're you're trembling it doesn't always feel like you're about to speak in tongues sometimes serving the lord feels very natural just when you wake up every day and you put your feet on the ground and you're facing troubles and you're facing difficulties and you're facing trials but you have faith to come to church and you have faith to keep on believing it and you just no matter what you're going through you're still confessing but i know my god's a healer and i know my god's a deliverer and it may not make sense right now but i know he's got it all in control how many times friends have you said that from your mouth and says but i know the lord has it all in control do you realize it may not feel anointed it may not feel like you're on fire it may not feel like you're about to shout but you just utter the words he's got it all in control do you realize that that may not feel like anything but you are accomplishing the purpose of god and defying the kingdom of the enemy and so he comes he comes to this place and he begins to say you're you're down cast i'm going to deliver you my my people will not he says they'll they'll i'll have mercy on the troubled ones it's incredible because even through all of this voice of encouragement and through all of the words of the lord that he's speaking to them their reaction isn't to suddenly stand up and say praise the lord i've heard the voice of god is going to deliver me and i know it doesn't look like it but i'm going to rejoice no the isaiah 49 and verse 14 it says but zion says if you have this you could put it up isaiah 49 and 14 brother josh he says now this is the lord after he speaks himself i'll deliver them i'll have mercy upon you leave me lead you by the springs of living water i'll comfort my people and have mercy on all the troubled ones and he says in verse 14 but zion said this is their reply the lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten me even after the voice of the lord do you do you know what that would feel like now i'm just going to stop here and say something because i'm preaching to you put on your strength do you realize what it does to the lord when he's to when with the the the reaction that it draws from a heavenly father when he's promised his children something and their reply isn't to trust his word that reply isn't to grab ahold by faith but to say the lord's forsaken me he's forgotten me how much it hurts and i'm going to speak to speak on this and a man would understand this because a man to to a man thank you brother your word means something right when you give your word to to your wife and you tell and you tell them something you don't believe a real man he has a sense of good pride and we preach against private there's there's a there's a pride or let me say a dignity that a man should have he should his word should mean something to him you know it bothers him to a man it bothers him when he gives his word and he doesn't he senses that there's a distrust you don't trust me well i i said it didn't i made a promise didn't i and it's something discouraging to him even to a young man as as a teenage boy to have the trust of his father should mean something to him that when he tells you when you when you tell him something he doesn't question he doesn't research it he doesn't investigate it he just takes you at your word and there's there's a sacred trust that he has that when he speaks he means it he'll stand behind it and you can depend upon it a man even in a marriage in a home when a wife takes the word and when the when when a husband speaks and then maybe a trouble or some kind of issue has came up and the man just the man says don't worry honey it's going to be okay i'm going to take care of it you know it does something it gives that man some sense of fulfillment when the pressure really comes off and the the fear leaves his family because he's given his word it does something to him when he can look at a troubled situation and they believe him and he maybe doesn't have it all figured out and he doesn't even have know how it's going to work out but he has he has his family has the assurance that the man the father the high priest the head of the home the father the husband the father you can rest the easy because i'm gonna i'm gonna take care of this don't worry i'm gonna take care of us how much more to our heavenly father when he promises us his word how much it must delight him when we believe his word and how it must hurt him when we doubt his word are you with me here this morning and he says but but zion said the lord has forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten me now notice these aren't these aren't sons of the devil these aren't heathens that we're dealing with here this is this is this this is zion this is the family of god the whole the holy family of god separated unto god who is chosen this isn't the sinner this isn't the the the hittite or the perizzite or the canaanite this is god's family his own children of whom the virginity or the seed line or the life would come through and they're they're saying the lord has forsaken me he's forgotten me who saw the lord notice this the bible says they're the sons of abraham those who knew righteousness in whose heart was the law of god if anybody should have believed the word it should have been them if anybody should have taken god his word and accepted it it should have been him that's why the lord began to get so impatient and he says i even i this is isaiah chapter 51 and you can turn there brother josh isaiah 51 and verse 12 we're going to get to 52. let's look at verse 12 of isaiah 51 notice what the lord is saying here you can almost see this impatience of the lord as god says i'm going to deliver you i'm going to i'm going to deliver you you're going to walk by springs of water and then their response is oh the lord's forsaken us he's forgotten us so god continues he says i even i am he that comforteth you who art thou that thou should just be afraid of a man that shall die and of the son of man which shalt be made as grass keep going verse 13 and he says and forgivest the lord thy maker that has stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth and has feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor as if he were ready to destroy and where is the fury of the oppressor now it's incredible because god has given them this word he's reminding them he's he's crying out to them and then you come all the way over to isaiah chapter 52. if you'll turn there where we read we're just going to read this again he says awake awake verse 1 put on thy strength o zion put all thy beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for hence forth there shall no more come unto thee the uncircumcised in the unclean awake awake so they're in this they're in this stupor they're down on the ground they're they're they're asleep or else he wouldn't be staying awake they've forgotten who they were they forgotten who their heavenly father was they forgotten his promises how can you forgive me the lord is trying to remind them it's i even i he goes on further we read it we read it here in verse um the verse six therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know in that day that i am he that doth speak behold verse 6 brother josh behold it is i therefore my people should know my name they shall know that in that day that i am he that doth speak behold it is i you see how much the lord wants to make himself known in the middle of your darkness do you see how much the lord wants and has a desire they shall know that i am he that speaks behold in his eye back up to verse one he says wake awake put all my strength shake thyself verse two from the dust arise and sit down o jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck o captive daughter of zion a condition that she was in in the dust and even to god remember this is this is zion's this is this is the daughter of god this isn't the daughter of jezebel this is his own family this is his own daughter if anybody he was going to project his love to it would be his own daughter and here is a father she sees it and he sees her in this condition and she's in the dust and she was she was once imagine what she was she was once a pure uh uh a beautiful woman and she she has royal garments because of who she is but now she's in the dirt her her garment is tattered it's it's it's full of it's it's dust she's in the dust she's laying there and she's being abused she's being trampled on by the uncircumcised and the unclean her garment is now torn and it's filthy and it's dirty and it's tattered and it's whole has holes in and she's laying there and gone and she's howling in despair and crying out and she's got a chain on her neck imagine this condition that even his even her heavenly father's looking at this and he begins to speak and he says wake up wake up child get up out of the dirt do you know who you are do you know who do you remember who where you came from and he says she's laying there and he says shake myself from the dust she's clutching at this chain about her neck it's incredible because i'm reminded of the words of the apostle paul and he says be you speaking to the family of god he says be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage wherewith christ hath already set you and made you free so you can take god and god can deliver you and free you and let you can free you of chains and then you yourself go and chain yourself right back up and he says she's clutching at her neck and god is saying now the enemy's there he's blaspheming taunting her and and then god god comes and it is it's it's amazing because he doesn't pick her up he doesn't he doesn't stand there and shield her from the enemy and and come in like a great superman and pick her up and dust her off and and shake her off and then take her and to put a garment god doesn't do any of that he just speaks to her amen awake awake put on your strength now that's easy to do it's easy to do when you're vibrant and full of life and prayers are being answered and you're walking and constant vision of the lord and the lord's just pouring out blessing and and my there's no trouble and it's easy to do you stand there and i'm a child of god i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god it's easy to do it's much harder when life is so troubled you and so afflicted you and the devil so fought you and so attacked you and now you're down it's much easier when you're already standing to put on your beautiful garment it's much harder when you're down on the ground and you're having trouble and satan has walked all over her and now she can hear maybe just as a faint cry she's even there groveling doesn't know who she is her senses her sensibility is gone and and and and and she's this is this is the daughter of god bearing the one who bore the vessel of god and now now now she's laying there it's so much easier when you're on top of the world so much harder when life comes and hits you out of nowhere and you find yourself turned turned around and you're you're trying to get your senses about you and you know and when it rains it pours and when the devil knows he's got you starting to get you down here brother branham says that's when he really throws on the punches and he when he sees he got you tripped up and starting to fall man he'll really unleash all hell upon you and upon you and attack you from every direction and attack your mind and your family and your children your finances your health they'll get you and it'll get you to such a place to where you're just almost like brother banh talks about amnesia you forget who you are you forget who where you came from and he says and she's down on the ground and god's beginning to whisper to her and beginning to speak to her it's incredible because you come to this story and i'm just going to take a complete turn here there's no there's it's amazing because there's no one to me there's there's a few characters in the bible that are more uh up and down and in and out and one day in and one day out then the man jacob started looking even just two days ago and the lord just brought me i knew this was the direction of the lord lord have me go just looking over this man's life and jacob's is a is a uh a cheater you you he's he's he's a conniver he's a supplanter it's what his name means he deceives and he connives he's manipulating and he's and and yet what's so incredible is that this this man who you read about that's so horrible and so evil yet god loves this man amen and he says that even before he was born before he ever came or breathed life before he'd done good or evil paul makes it clear that god says i loved him there's a there's a there's a love that he had for this man he wasn't a good man but he was god's man and you can be not a good man but you could be god's man and there are certain people who are good men who aren't god's men and by worldly standards they might seem good but to god is really all that matters because we look on the outward appearance that's natural it's normal for our in our fallen flesh even as a believer we look on the outward we look in the in the chart of wins and losses that's how we view people we look at the outward appearance and god says for you he says but i'm my ways just let me remind you this morning god doesn't see things how we see things let me remind you family of god you may be looking at a certain situation a certain way and god might be looking at it entirely different completely different but god's purpose comes upon this man's life and when god's purpose when god sets out his purpose upon a life nothing can stop that purpose let me go further and say that god's purpose never dies and it never changes no matter what god sets his purpose to no matter what happens or how the object of that purpose responds god's purpose never changes you take a man like samson who who would look at a life of of of the of just disaster at the very end a man who has so much potential and did so much for god and god comes to him and even at his birth you remember when he appears to manoah in judges uh 12 or 13 and god appears to manoah and he appears to this man and this this father and mother and he says for lo thou shall conceive a son and and no razor shall come upon his head there will be a nazareth unto god and god begins to tell them that even before samson is born even before he's ever done anything good or he's ever done anything bad before any of that happens god has a purpose for a life whether that life ever comes to the purpose that god calls it to doesn't change whether god's purpose is upon that life now i'm just going to stop and slow down because i just felt the anointing of the holy spirit said it's right here this is what the struggle was even over thank you lord god's purpose upon samson's life didn't change when samson didn't go god's way it did not matter god didn't see samson and see a man who was going to surrender and a heart that was submissive to the lord and he says aha ah i got it that man look at him look at look at his obedience right there that's the perfect candidate right there and now i'm gonna come no before samson ever was born before he ever came onto the earth before he ever proved himself god decided a purpose would be fulfilled in his life and it did not change god comes to minoa and says he'll be a nazareth unto god and he says he'll be he'll be and he says for he'll begin to deliver for the the my my the israel out of the hand of the oppressors the philip the philistines and god says and i don't want to take time to turn there but if you look in the book of judges and he says for lo he shall be a nazarite unto god even from his birth unto his death that's right it'll be a nazareth unto god from his birth all the way to his death from the beginning when you turn the first page in the very first story before you even turn and open the book there's a purpose that god has so it didn't matter what happened in the middle didn't what matter what what chapter 2 or chapter 3 or chapter 4 said god set out a purpose upon a life and it wouldn't change even when samson resisted and went the total opposite direction of that purpose because god made a promise and god is a promised keeper he doesn't break his word he's a covenant keeper and when he promises something he sees it through to the end and god says he'll be a nazarite unto he says there'll be a nazi than me from his birth even unto his death that means that even death doesn't change the purpose that god has and so god breathes upon this man we know his life goes to completely opposite direction he marries the wrong woman he goes into the wrong town he messes up here and he messes up there and he's a complete failure you say well then i'm sure at some point god says man you know what i must have made a horrible mistake when i when i came to manila i'm really i picked the wrong guy no god's promise never changed god was with samson in timnath he was with samson at at no matter uh at gaza he was with samson with the philistines he was with samson you say he was there god made a promise and he wouldn't leave though his life with the opposite direction god's purpose never changes even to jacob we find jacob's stories he's running from esau he steals the birth white church birthright tricks him tricksy man and esau because of the kind of man he is gives up the birthright for a pot of stew and so jacob jacob uh comes and he's now he's on the run and the mother sees the trouble that uh that's going to happen and and rebecca hears of this and and esau says i'm going to murder him i'm going to kill my brother and so rebecca says oh jacob we've got to do so or isaac we got to do something with jacob so let's send him away and so jacob goes on his journey and and and he sets off and goes to pataram and and and his entire life takes a turn and a course now remember remember the purpose of god was already upon his life before he tricked esau the purpose of god was already about his life before he was ever born so jacob sets off and genesis chapter 28 brother josh if you want to pull that up that'd be good genesis 28 he goes to where laban lives he's going to find a wife there and going gonna try to live peacefully while esau is calming down and so he goes and god gives him this amazing genesis chapter 28 verse 12 brother josh look at this as he appears to jacob and he dreamed and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached the heaven now god appears to jacob in a dream and jacob sees this ladder and it goes from heaven from earth all the way up to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it now this incredible dream that god gives jacob isn't just you know isn't just some kind of uh oh effect or god's just gonna shake him or give him this incredible vision just to give him a vision just to give him a dream just it isn't for a show god does nothing for a show god does nothing just to impress somebody he's not going to impress you he's not going to impress me when god does something it's for a specific reason and a specific purpose and has a specific message behind it and so jacob dreams this dream and it's not a like we said it's not some kind of special effect or way to get him emotional and get him stirred up but god is literally drawing back the curtains of earth he's drawing back the curtains of jacob's current surroundings and his curtain current conditions and god says jacob i want to show you something that just beyond this human realm just beyond this human veil is a curtain i'm going to draw back as brother branham says just beyond this curtain he says just be on this curtain of time in this dimension and god takes them beyond the curtain of time what's he doing he's opening the curtain to let brother branham realize there's more to your life than just what you see there's more to your life than just what you're going through you look at the here and now and the current struggle and the current problem and the current issue and the current stress but god says let me just draw back the curtain of time to show you there's a much bigger picture than what you're seeing brother brandon says he says would you would you ever he says i he says oh oh would you like just to see beyond the curtain of time and brother adam says it this way he says oh it would help me so much i'm glad he let brother branham see because it wasn't just going to help him it's going to help me in 2022 to see beyond the curtain of time and realize there's more to this life than just what meets the eye god was literally drawing the curtain back and showing jacob what's he seeing a ladder an angel's going up down and up and down and up and down what's he trying to show jacob jacob even if you don't see it there's activity happening all the time even if you don't sense it or you don't feel a child and you feel like things are just mundane and things are to stale there's something taking place all the time there's angels going up and coming down they're coming to visit you and encourage you and pray for you and and try to anoint your faith there's something happening jacob there's activity in the heavenlies amen at all times jacob they never stop they never stop they go up and they go down and they never quit and they never angels never get tired hello somebody angels let me tell you you might get fatigued and you might get tired but god never gets tired he never gets tired he never gets fatigued he's not sweating you might labor and you might toil and you might sweat but there's divine oh i just want to tell you this morning there's divine activity that is happening on behalf of your family even when you can't see it and you can't feel it and you can't hear it and there's no evidence of it oh it's like the song says even when it feels like i'm surrounded i'm surrounded by you amen and what what's the what's the what's the the verse say even when it feels like you're not working you're working even when it doesn't feel like you're moving you're moving even when it feels like there's no activity to my life take courage god's moving that's what god was showing jacob these angels have an assignment they're going back and forth to earth to lead and to guide and to minister the bible says the angels of god camp about those who fear him they can't they literally camp and take their abode amongst god's family those angels that are there to warn you to protect you to guide you to minister to you to encourage you to guard you god says jacob i want you to understand because it's going to become important in your life specifically there's a ladder there and all those angels that are going up and down god says i'm going to make a promise to you jacob and i'm going to keep working out my promise and my plan no matter if you sit down and you get tired and you feel discouraged god says i'm going to keep working i'm going to keep moving i'm going to keep proceeding i'm going to keep pursuing i'm going to keep going and he says in verse 13 turn there if you could in genesis chapter 28 he says in verse 13 and behold the lord stood above it now this is god above everything that he's seen jacob sees this ladder he sees this vision and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac now why is god saying this this is important because now god is joining this man jacob and he's attaching him to a promise he already made to a father and a grandfather you see why the birthright was so important to jacob because that right that birthright that meant that the lineage of christ the messiah would come through his seed and so jacob fights to get that birthright are you here church he fights to get that birthright so god now because he has the birthright god stands above it and says i'm the lord god of abraham thy father and of god and he says and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed so what's god doing because jacob has the birth he's not a good man don't don't forget this this is not a good man he's not a god man yet in fact he never will be until his name is changed hello hope you're catching that this morning he'll never be a god man until his name is changed but does that mean the purpose of god is not with him even when he's not a good god man even when he's not before he's israel when he's still jacob when he's still a deceiver god is still making a promise to him remember what brother branham says he says at the at pentecost he says they didn't become sons at pentecost when the spirit of god he says that he they didn't become sons then they were always sons and he says you didn't become a son of god because you were born again you were always a son of god even in your sinful most darkest moments you were always a son therefore you were reborn so jacob even though he's not a good man yet the promises of god is with him and god says and to thee will i give it and to thy seed so now god brings jacob into this covenant blessing with abraham and isaac the lord was saying i've accepted you into my promise into my plan you're the firstborn now jacob and now through you you have the birthright so now all of the blessings that i promised to abraham and all of the promises and all of the blessings that i promised to isaac are now passed down to you and you did nothing to deserve that do you realize the promises you have today because of mercy that rewrote your life and you're a spiritual seed of abraham and you did nothing to deserve it but the same promises that he made to abraham are now passed down to you and your family and to your seed and to your children and your children's children there's a promise and a blessing that is upon the life of a believer and they did nothing to deserve it we ought to be thankful this morning now god says in verse 15 notice this here verse 15 he says and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places whether thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken what a powerful promise that god makes to a very bad man what a powerful covenant god attaches to this deceiving shyster lying conniving manipulating here's the same man that comes before laban and this man is so good that he decides he's not sure if laban's gonna kill him or not so he sends his wife and kids first to see well if they die then i know i'll retreat and go the other way that's what kind of man we're dealing with not much of a man but yet even in that state god's purpose is is with him god says i'll behold i am with thee and we'll keep thee and all i love this this is my sermon here for today i'll keep thee in all the places whether thou go god was giving him an oath and he says i'll never leave you jacob i want you to remember this promise i'll be with you every step you take every step every turn you'll never make a move in your life that i'm not right there beside you does that mean jacob is going to go everywhere that god tells him to go no he's going to go the opposite but does that change the plan of god does god ever leave him no when god says go left jacob goes right but god didn't go left god went right with jacob because god's purpose follows his seed he follows his child no matter where that child goes god says i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'm going to go with you every when i say go straight and you do a u-turn and you go the other way god says well i guess i'll make a u-turn and go with you and then god says now go right and you go left god says i'll be with you in all the places i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you until i've done that which i have spoken to thee of my purpose will never change listen even if you never surrender to my will i'll never leave you even if you spend your life calloused and cold and carnal unsurrendered my promise is still right beside you no matter what jacob no matter where you go i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you oh i know i've preached on this here before but i'm just going to cover it just one more time do you realize what god says to jacob when he says in isaiah we've read it in isaiah and even if you back up god says to god says this exact thing to jacob i'll never leave you i'll be with you i'll go with you in all the places whether no matter where you go jacob i'm going to stay right with you oh captive daughter he says the same thing to israel get up awake put on your strength notice he doesn't rebuke her he doesn't chastise her he doesn't speak to her meanly or an uh or a voice to attack her he's just like a kind heavenly father he whispers to her wake up awake put on your strength o zion put on your beautiful garments he says in isaiah chapter 49 can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet i will not forget thee behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands and he says thy walls are continually before me this is isaiah 49 thy walls the word for wall is choma which means like a brick mason would lay a brick and then he'd lay another brick upon another brick and he'd lay another brick upon another brick and another brick upon another brick what's he saying he's saying the brick is joined it becomes one with the wall god is saying behold i've graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls i've attached myself to you this is what god does to jacob i'm attaching myself to you jacob i'm this isn't this isn't a covenant to where if you do this and i do that if you do this i'll keep that god says i'm going to attach myself i'm going to build like a mason would build a wall a brick upon a brick upon a brick and no matter where you go there am i no matter where you ever go jacob i'll be with you can a woman forget her suckling child yeah they may forget but i cannot forget you because i've graven you upon the palms of my hands your walls are continually before before me we followed this here before and i'm just going to follow it here just for a moment in genesis chapter 28 i want you to look here in verse 16 as jacob begins to speak and he says and jacob awoke out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place this is i this is genesis 28 brother micah verse 16. and he says here and jacob i woke out of his sleep and said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not and he was afraid and said how dreadful now it's amazing when you click on that word it doesn't mean awful but actually the opposite it means awesome and he says how awesome is this place this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven jacob wakes up and he says here jacob rose up early in the morning and he took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil what's he trying to do he this man he's trying to do anything he can all he knows is he woke up and there was this incredible dream and he looks and he looks at the stone that his head was on and he literally takes he's just trying to do anything he can to remember to memorialize this spot so he takes the rock and he builds an altar and he says okay this is the rock my head was laying upon and he's gonna take that rock and he's gonna place it upon another then he's gonna he's gonna step back and go god met me right there and i've seen the dream and it's gonna take oil and he's gonna begin to pour oil upon that stone he's anointing that stone and you say oh jacob you're just being emotional you're all worked up and all you know in the frenzy old because god you're gonna take a stone you know that's what i said it might have looked very natural to other people but do you know god noticed what jacob did and god was watching as jacob takes this stone and he's pouring oil upon the stone jacobs rose up early in his pillar and poured over along the top of it verse 19 going brother micah and he says and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of the city was called lose at the first so he gives it a name this house of god this is none other this is none other but the house of god and he makes a promise to god and he says god i'll now he says if you'll be with me and will keep me uh and give me bread to eat of ramen to eat he says raymond to put on verse 21 and he says so that i come again to my father's house in peace then shall the lord be my god and you know what happens time long space of time goes on twenty years elapsed from that experience 20 long years of a heart that is not in tune with god that is not in sync with his purpose that is still selfish that is still bitter that is still cheating still stealing still lying still conniving and god says go left jacob goes right god says turn around jacob continues on even after this great experience that god has and after all of the wonder and all of the glory of this moment and he's a pouring oil and he's anointing this pillar and yet 20 years go on and there's nothing jacob's just going the opposite direction you see you can have an experience with god and have a great powerful thing that god does for your life but if you don't come under simple obedience to the word of god simple obedience to the word of god in your life becomes disobedient and you spend 20 long years and he spends 20 long dreadful years stuck you know you can spend years stuck you get stuck in a ditch somewhere and your wheels are spinning and you're not going anywhere and the the more you you pit that gas pedal the deeper those wheels sink and the deeper the truck goes and the deeper the problem is and you can spend years and years and years in a rut in a ditch jacob spends years stuck when jacob when are you going to believe when jacob are you going to not just say amen to these things but when are you going to actually believe them amen and you spend years in church and years in church and years in church going from this place to that place into this ministry and that ministry and this place and that place and the problem all along lies within you jacob and he spends 20 years stuck in a rut unable to get out and he still comes to the same problem the same issue god surely surely lord you would have given up on this man after year five five years lord surely no lord what are you doing in his life i'm still standing here just waiting eight nine years 10 years 11 years let's get a status update on brother jacob where's he at lord says he's still right there still stuck in the same ditch still has the same problem lord when are you going to move on never you see when i made a promise to this man it was from birth all the way to death and even if he goes to his grave like this i'll never leave i'll never forsake him just like he says to that daughter of zion awake wake up lord pull jacob out of it no i can't lord send him get him out just pick him up just jerk him up brother branham says if god takes you through a pipe and he says and he just hears you and he says but almost like a pipe he just pulls you out through the other side and says then how would you ever say you ever overcame anything god just deliver him lord pick him up out of it god you see him in this condition he's your child he's been given your promise lord surely you'll do something special for him god says i've already done everything jacob needs i've already put inside of him [Music] it's already there daughter of zion it's already inside of you lord you see her she's laying there she's being trampled upon surely as a heavenly father you're gonna send out a rescue you're just going to come and and no no god says what i'm going to do i'm going to keep speaking awake child wake up put on your strength and he says put on your beautiful garments lord can't you put them on her no i've given them i've given her the garment but she's got to be the one to put it on i've given her everything she has need of in her journey of life all the way to a body changes already down inside of her and it's so amazing how many years people get stuck waiting for god to come and send out a rescue and some supernatural thing and this daughter of zion could have laid there for years and you know what would have happened if she discontinued to lay there she would have died there she would have died there what happens to samson he continues and he continues and continues until finally his life comes to an end now god did something glorious at the end of his life but all what god could have done had that child ever just surrendered and became obedient to the purpose of god that was following him wake up put on your strength oh beautiful daughter of zion put on your strength i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'm never going to quit on you i'm never going to give up on you i'm never going to stop but in order for me to do anything you've got to believe it child you've got to make a choice to believe it but you've heard this preach for year after year where you had jacob i'm still stuck in the same place why jacob you've been preached deliverance you've been preached freedom you've been preached the power of the blood you've been preached the power of atonement you've been preached the power of reconciliation you've been preached the power of redemption how much more do you need jacob everything that you need is already inside of you amen but you've got to choose to believe the word of god you got to choose to believe it no one they're waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting just like the man at bethesda the poor man the pull of bethesda and jesus comes to this man an invalid for 30 i think 38 years he lays at this pool and you know jesus comes to him and it's incredible when you go read the account and jesus comes to this man jesus doesn't sit down beside this man now here's this invalid 38 years his back no doubt is hurting he can he his sores all over his body from laying there and jesus doesn't come and say oh man bud oh my poor brother does your back hurt is it painful no you know why because sin when he's healed jesus says go and sin no more so sin had put him here and jesus just comes to this man he just goes right to the cuts right to the chase and says sir will you be made whole amen and then the man starts oh well you see at 38 years every time the angel comes and stirs the water i have no man and he doesn't pick me up and and i just lay here sort of like that groveling woman a daughter of zion she's just laying there groveling getting trampled on in the dust and god's saying wake up and then god says loose yourself from the bands that are upon your neck this man says i've been laying here for years and and have no man to pick me up and to put me in the water and then jesus you know jesus you never find a dialogue you never find a conversation jesus lets him finish and then he repeats will you be made whole and so the man repeats well every time 38 years i've been laying here and there's no man to pick me up and no man to put me in the water you see people and i've said this and preached this many years ago the drunkard when he drinks alcohol and he watches how it destroys his life and it destroys his marriage and it takes his driver's license and and it takes his family and it kills his career and it kills his job he hates that people hate the result of addiction they hate the result of sin but jesus doesn't come to say do you hate the problems that sin has caused you no he says do you hate the sin do you hate the disease not the symptoms that it's caused you will you be made whole will you be delivered daughter of zion jacob for years god just keeps on and keeps on and keeps on can i have just a few more minutes are you here this morning for 20 long years trial and sorrow but you know what god's attached after leaving bethel jacob settles down and he quickly quickly i mean it's amazing how fast we forget what the lord does for us in our life amen just like that it's like poof it's gone and jacob's right back to his own his old disobedient backslid and lustful and god appears to jacob in genesis 31 brother josh genesis 31 and verse 13. after he's cold and backslidden god appears to him again and he says in verse 13 i am the god of bethel where thou anoint us the pillar notice aha god noticed you think you're getting emotional when you do something and god's brother diggs is here preaching stand up and shout and say a man might do it you think oh he's just getting emotional god notices what you do god notices the voice that you say amen with god hears it and it's not important for a preacher to hear you say amen it's important for god to hear you say amen i believe what's being preached i agree with what's being preached lord be it unto me according to thy word god notice what jacob did to that pillar and the oil and he says in the god i'm the god of where thou knowing is the pillar thou vow to vow unto me now arise what's he saying to that woman that daughter wake up arise he says jacob arise lord why didn't you force him why didn't you just pull him to it no god just keeps telling him the word arise get thee out from this land and return into the land of thy kindred go left jacob he's like jacob come on you can do it jacob you're gonna do it and you read the next verse jacob you're going right god said go left why'd you go right what's it gonna take jacob for you to believe the word of god here god's coming to you appearing to you again go back to jay go back to bethel instead he goes to shechem hold on a minute i just read god said go to bethel you would you went to to check them what's what's going on in your mind jacob he's stuck in that rut he's stuck in that ditch he's stuck there and his wheels just keep spinning and his problems get bigger and his ditch gets deeper and it just exacerbates the problem he goes to shechem it's amazing because in hebrew if you click on the word shekham and strong's concordance it means two things going back not to bethel but backsliding and it means this a place of burdens a place of burdens do you know do you know what it is do you know what it means do you know what it brings when you disobey what god tells you you know where you come to a place of burdens and shechem's going to be a place of great burden to this man it's going to go beyond and scar jacob now the effect of the father is not just going to affect the father the man jacob but now that disobedience is going to pass down and it's going to mark his family because disobedience to the word obedience to the word blesses not just the man but the entire family and disobedience to the word doesn't just hurt one but it hurts the whole body and shechem is going to mean it mean a place of burdens all kinds of trouble is going to come from that choice jacob his daughter his daughter dina is going to be defiled that's just a mess man i don't even want to get into it this morning just to save time but just a mess a mess he goes instead of to bethel he he goes to shechem and then what happens to his daughter now his sons and his sons become murderers and then murder the sons of of this man the the all of his brothers and jacob barely gets out barely gets out there alive and his one daughter's affected for the rest of her life she's defiled and burdens are now brought upon him jacob my now at this point if i was his daddy if you were his if you were his daddy if you were his father it's so amazing how if we were the father of some of these men and we were the dad and we looked at what a child does it's so amazing how human love is so different than god's love amen so quickly we would have just marked him off so fast we would have just wrote him off how quick we are to write people off lord forgive me i'm the from the guiltiest lord forgive me how differently god looks at people than how we look at people and god deserves the heart we see the outward appearance god doesn't that's right amen and sometimes we say why is why are they due why are we my goodness we we should we if i was in charge well that's why you're not [Music] oh boy i would jacob my look at what's happened now it's not just you it's your daughter how differently we respond than how god responds to jacob shechem means a place of burdens and going back and horrible burdens comes to this man you've disobeyed the lord jacob you've never obeyed him you've met you've missed everything he said you went the opposite direction than he's ever told you've just completely ignored him look what god says in genesis chapter 35 verse 1. here's god's here's god's rebuke you ready for the heavenly father to come with the cracking of the whip and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel god hold on lord aren't you going gonna mention something didn't you see what he did surely lords are gonna chastise him and rebuke him and look what he's done to his family lord says arise go up to bethel and dwell there and make an altar unto god that appeared unto thee when thou fled us from the face of esau thy brother he doesn't mention shechem he doesn't he doesn't mention the mistake he does you know so many times we would we were the ones who always bring up our past and bring up our mistakes god never mentions any of it god just keeps giving you the word what's god's gonna say arise wake up daughter of zion put on your strength old daughter of zion get up out god are you gonna give up no i'm never gonna give up god didn't you see what they did i've seen what they did what are you gonna do lord i'm gonna keep getting up on sunday morning and i'm going to keep preaching i'm going to keep preaching i'm going to keep encouraging i'm never going to give up when you're going to walk out on me god i'm never going to walk out on you when are you going to finally have enough of me and just kick me to the side let me make sure it's clear in your mind as a son and daughter of god he will never ever ever give up on you he will keep preaching he'll keep praying he'll keep encouraging you until your faith rises up out of the dust and says i'll grab a hold of what you've given me god i'm going to take a hold of the lifeline this morning god says i'm going to keep preaching i'm going to keep pursuing i'm going to keep pressing and no matter what avenue i have to use in your life until you believe the word of god god can't make you he can't force you he can't force you i can't force you as much as you want to make your children believe and you want to make them accept it i can't make them you can't force them here's what you can do don't never give up on them don't never kick them to the side keep praying for them keep preaching to them keep giving them the word keep encouraging them listen to me child it's already inside of them what they need is already there the strength is already there you just got to speak to that seed gene of god look beyond the flesh that you see on the outside god looks beyond your mistakes he looks beyond your flesh you know what god sees the potential he put down inside of you and when god preaches and chastises a child and preaches to one of his children he's not preaching to the symptoms he's preaching to the seed down inside amen and he says put on your strength i'm going to close put on your strength look at isaiah chapter 52 quickly before we close here he says put on shake thyself verse 2 shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down old jerusalem loose thyself you know we're waiting on people we're waiting on something we're waiting on some ministry or some camp meeting or some revival service so many people get stuck in that ditch and they're waiting for something magnificent to happen and god's saying to you it's not coming it's already inside of you hallelujah i've already put it down inside of your child i've just got to speak to that believer down inside of you you may not look like it you may not feel like it but there's an overcomer down inside of you and i've just got to get that overcomer to wake up i've got to get him to come to his senses and shake himself he says put on your strengths glory awake put on that strength you know that strength the hebrew word is are we or uh oh we however you say the word it means a self boldness like a lion shaking his mane it's literally what it means what is god saying i'm not gonna come and rescue you i'm not gonna come and pick you up daughter of zion it's already down inside of you you may not feel like it but it's already there down inside of you you may feel like a wimp like a puny good for nothing is your backslidden scared uh uh you may you may feel like the the weakest of christians but i've put a lion down inside of you and i've gotta wake him up this morning i've got to wake his face up and shake himself to realize i've deposited something down inside of you that's what the preaching of the word does it comes not to give you faith but it comes to anoint your faith it doesn't come to give you a seed gene of god you've already got it inside of you it comes to strike the word across that seed and that seed will come to life amen shake thy self don't wait for it child it's already inside of you i was so reminded just so taken back even this morning and several months to a month or so ago i was ministering brother john andy's church there in washington the lord just anointed my faith and ever since these words were spoken the lord just stirred something and deposited something down inside of me and i knew i'd be preaching it so here i am today preaching it to you i remember just back going back to october of last year my mind went all the way back i watched again even the freshly just to put it all back in my memory again of the testimony service we had and the the testimonies of deliverance for sister kathy and brother mark and brother jason and the different ones god just did miraculous things in our church into the body of believers and he said as i was studying this message and studying these things put on your strength i was so just just just shook even even there and this in the back office even hearing it again i just weeped and began to break and it became more real to me than it ever became to me that it ever came to me even just this morning as i was just reminded of the testimony of brother jason specifically when he was in the hospital my mind goes back to the two o'clock 2 15 in the morning looked at the text message call from sister amy saying brother matt brother jason he's bad he's jason's really his oxygen's down in the 80s and and we knew he had been sick and he'd been at home suffering from covid and and then my dad even himself was there at home sick and not able to stand up and he would have sister amy said someone's got to come and get him right now you've got to take him to the hospital the emergency room right now and i'm trying to wake up and trying to process everything that she's telling me and i could hear even just even through the text messages and i'm texting my dad and my dad's sick and brother travis who lived close by sister deborah they were sick with cove at him did we seem like it just went rampant through the church 12 or 13 families and god had had shown mercy and we i hadn't had it yet i was one of the only ones the only one in the ministry that wasn't sick with it and so my dad said i can't go i'm sick i can't even stand up right now and and he says you can't go get jason because you're the last one basically the last man standing and he's and i said well brother travis already has it brother travis can go and get him so i called travis wolf travis up three approaching three o'clock in the morning and i woke him up and said travis jason apparently he's really sick he's he's amy's really worried about him you gotta take him right now and then he said right i said you got to get there quick so travis wakes up gets in his car go straight to brother jason i'm texting brother andrew uh immediately brother andrew not sure if you get this i'm not sure if you're even working tonight but if you're working please just respond to me we've got an urgent situation and brother andy responds what's wrong brother jason he said he has cove and i said yes he's apparently he's declined and he's his oxygen and i was reading even just this morning some of the you know sometimes it's good to go back and see what god did went back to some of the text messages i had with brother andrew and brother travis and and and then brother travis goes and gets brother jason and takes him my brother jason doesn't even well remember some of these details we tell him and he believes us some of them he don't even remember doesn't remember it happening brother travis gets him in the car and and immediately takes him there and and so i'm just waiting you know to even there now it's 3 30 in the morning and i'm starting to just process and think about this and think okay he'll be fine he'll get to the hospital and travis is there okay all is well and then brother travis calls me and i could hear it in his voice and he says i i i wasn't that really that really got to me real bad i said what he said i wasn't expecting that brother jason is really really sick and i said what do you mean travis he said he just he couldn't even speak he couldn't talk he he didn't he said he just was out of it and and and and it just really affected him and i remember hearing those that voice and i thought wow you know you put it off in your mind that anything bad could ever really happen brother jason's young and and you're thinking there's no there's no way you know he'll he'll be fine and then brother andrew who every time one of our believers here at our church goes into the hospital you know we communicate brother andrew communicate back and he's always positive and always oh yeah we got them in there they'll be fine and there's always a good message of positivity and hope and you know sort of put your mind at rest if it can be put to rest and and i said brother andrew can you give me an update can you give me another mr amy's waiting on an update can you give an update brother just responds he's critically ill that's all i can tell you no words of hope no we don't know he's sick he's definitely going to be admitted to the hospital he's very he's a very sick person i remember laying there at three three o'clock in the morning and i'm trying to go back to sleep and just pray and me and rachel both just prayed i remember laying there and the thought just dawned on me and i thought it's like you're trying to wrestle with this this this reality that we could lose brother jason no there's no way his family is all of his children that we love sister amy and you're thinking of this you know it's amazing how close when it hits close to home how real things become people could say what they want about this this and this and they speak very loosely about covet and how real it is and how when it comes really close and and i just remember laying there and i remember trying this trying struggling and just every time i'd wake up i pray and waiting for an update waiting for an update and you don't there's such a realm of the unknown and then days days go by and the report comes back and and it's just looking bleaker and bleaker and and brother jason has a condition where their sister amy calls the doctor calls the nurse and sister amy said i could hear the nurse and her voice she was fatigued having been up all night with jason she says tells amy he doesn't know who he is he doesn't know who you are he doesn't know what his job is he doesn't know any of his kids names could you imagine and and and i just remembered that as i went back in my memory and watching sister amy who no doubt just the devil's playing with her mind trying to tell her every lie of the enemy playing with brother j his brother jason testified and he said every forget the way you were to the brother jd but you said every weakness and every insecurity i ever had in my in my flesh satan attacked every single one of them and you do you no doubt you i remember that sister amy's saying she could hear the voice the the voice through the nurse and she's struggling and and even in her mind you know we're all we're only human you're only human and we have a tendency to doubt even the best of believers in the best of times hello i never never forget sister amy saying that she's beginning to just collapse and that morning she collapsed and she was a mess and no doubt all of the thoughts and all of the reality of that situation and sister amber comes to her house and i'll never forget those words the sister amy even is anointed with the message perfect faith lord gives her that message and there's something brother branham says there and and and there's a tongues and an interpretation and the interpretation of those tongues were exactly what she needed to hear for brother jason that yea the lord shall heal and the lord shall perform a miracle and she had texted jason and i'll never forget these words that sister amy said in her testimony she said i knew if i could just get jason if i could just get him to respond and i could give him the word and she said i knew he was in a terrible place and he couldn't believe for himself and he couldn't believe her situation she said but i knew he was a believer and i knew that if i could just get him the word and get him just to agree to it faith would start to take place and she said jason just responded need and she got the message and then a few moments later miracle need miracle the lord gave her an interpretation to a prophecy and i'm not even going to try to try to re rehearse it here but it was something to the effect that the miracle yay i'll perform what i've spoken yeah i'm god i'm a god who i'm the god who healeth thee and all thy diseases and sister amber comes to her house and amy's falling apart and broken even of her own self and trying to trying to have faith and you try to believe but but here she is even in her own flesh struggling and sister amber anointed of god inspired of god looked at sister amy and said sister amy you're gonna have to choose to believe you're going to have to make a choice to believe the word of god and sister amy said it did something to her i've got to make a choice it's one thing to quote the word it's one thing to just say the word but it's different when you say i believe the word of god because i'm a believer and she took hold of faith [Music] the lord inspired me as i heard those words again this morning and i just want to say this to you this morning church if there ever was a time to believe it's now if there ever was a time for you to be a believer and to cast aside doubt and to stand against the fear that's being spread in the world today it's time for believers to believe the word of god oh how many could raise a hand and say lord i'm going to make a choice to put on my strength it's inside of me stand to your feet with those hands raised and say lord i've got to make a choice today i choose to believe the word i'm going to choose to believe brother jason is here today and his recovery is so supernatural that you almost quickly forget the condition he was in hardly able to form a sentence just last year and now he stands here in his right mind sharp sharper than attack you say man did that man had not man had nothing to do with that that was god anointing the faith of a believer and when a believer who's already a believer chooses to believe the word nothing is impossible let me remind you here church you're a believer i said you're a believer to believe the word bow your heads with me if you could every head bowed ever i closed you're a believer today play something just softly for me if you could put on your strength lord inspired me with that and that testimony you gotta choose to believe you're going to have to make a choice you gotta choose you gotta choose it no one's gonna do it for you no one's gonna no one's gonna pick her up she's gonna lay there she's groveling she's in the dirt the dust and her she's being trampled on jacob you're in a ditch you're stuck you can't get out of that ditch you're stuck in that ditch lord who's gonna deliver me i just need somebody and every year no man picks me up oh child how long are you gonna stay stuck in that ditch you could stay stuck there for years and years and years you're waiting for somebody you're waiting for some supernatural you're waiting for some special event some special place some special speaker some special moment some special atmosphere but god's saying to you today it's already inside of you child it's not coming it's not next week it's now you've got to make a choice to believe you need something from god you need something in your family need something in your home and your mind and your health and your money and your finance and
