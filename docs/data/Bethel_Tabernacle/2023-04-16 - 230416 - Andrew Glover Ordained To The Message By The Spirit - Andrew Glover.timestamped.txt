[7:39] message in this hour of freedom from the
[7:42] things of this world. I love you this
[7:45] morning. I love your people, Father.

[12:20] as he sent his children to extend his

[12:29] So they journey down the old path
[12:33] that led to much destruction.
[12:38] All the while their loving hearts were
[12:42] hurting.
[12:46] Their hopes were crushed inside.

[13:50] All at once she caught his eye.
[13:54] From his lips the bids were high.
[13:58] She could not believe the voice that she
[14:02] was hearing.
[14:04] [Music]
[14:06] Would he in judgment take her life
[14:10] forever end his pain and strife?
[14:13] What would happen as she saw him drawing
[14:18] near her?

[15:13] "There's a new day just ahead.
[15:17] I've come to take you home."
[15:25] Oh, well, I've stood in that same place,
[15:30] bound by sin, a broken slave.
[15:34] From the depths of my despair, I prayed
[15:38] for mercy.
[15:42] I heard his word. He paid the price.
[15:46] On the cross, he gave his life.
[15:50] He took my hand.

[18:54] to enter heaven for a door could not be
[19:00] found.
[19:04] Heaven's walls were great and high.
[19:10] All inside were safe and sound.
[19:15] God
[19:17] who so loved mankind,
[19:21] who he'd made and give them bread,
[19:27] knew that to redeem them,
[19:32] the price to pay
[19:35] was dead.
[19:38] [Music]
[19:41] No search was made to find someone
[19:46] who would take this dreadful chore.
[19:51] [Music]
[19:52] Cuz only one,
[19:55] God's only son
[19:59] could be heaven's only door.
[20:05] The angels knew once he was gone, a song
[20:11] would not be.
[20:15] But a door to heaven
[20:18] is of no use
[20:21] unless on earth it's hung.
[20:25] A door was hung at Calary.
[20:31] It's standing open wide.
[20:37] Eternal life is waiting
[20:42] for all who step inside.
[20:49] And what has become earth's greatest
[20:54] game was heaven's greatest
[20:58] loss.
[21:00] Heaven's door was hung at Calary
[21:06] and it hinges on the cross.
[21:15] He entered this world through a virgin's
[21:19] womb and he felt our pain and strife.
[21:26] Through the door of death, he soon would
[21:31] go.
[21:33] Our great ransom paid for life.
[21:39] Once inside the door was sealed.
[21:43] Satan thought he'd won the war.
[21:49] But it's no secret how death was
[21:53] conquered.
[21:55] The key was in the door.
[21:59] A door was hung in Calary.
[22:05] It's standing open wide.
[22:11] Eternal life is waiting
[22:16] for all who step inside.
[22:23] And what has become earth's greatest
[22:27] game
[22:29] was heaven's greatest
[22:32] loss.
[22:34] Heaven's door was hung at Calary
[22:40] and it hinges on the cross.
[22:46] And what has become earth's greatest
[22:50] game?
[22:52] What's heaven's greatest
[22:55] loss?
[22:57] Heaven's door was hung
[23:01] at Calary
[23:03] and it hinges
[23:06] on the cross.

[25:01] traveled on,
[25:05] there was Jesus

[25:16] the ground.

[26:38] day.

[36:34] away.

[37:25] money
[37:28] and I don't
[37:30] wear the lady styles.
[37:34] [Music]
[37:36] And the house that I live in was old and
[37:41] run down. That's all right. It'll do for
[37:47] a while.
[37:50] Cuz soon I'll inherit a mansion.
[37:56] Oh, that never
[37:59] will decay.
[38:03] And I'll wear a white robe
[38:08] and a crown of glory
[38:11] that fadeth
[38:13] not
[38:15] away.
[38:18] Cuz it don't take this world's
[38:22] possessions.
[38:25] No money that I'll have to pay.
[38:33] It just took the blood
[38:36] of God's only son
[38:40] to wash all my sins away.
[38:46] And I don't have much longer to stay
[38:51] here.
[38:53] My race is almost run.
[38:59] [Music]
[39:00] And Lord, you know
[39:04] I've seen better days, but the best is
[39:09] yet to come.
[39:13] [Music]
[39:14] And Lord, you know
[39:18] I've seen better days, but the best is
[39:23] yet to come.
[39:25] [Music]
[39:29] [Applause]
[39:40] The more that I
[39:44] surrender,
[39:47] the lighter
[39:50] my love.
[39:53] The more that I release my gift,
[40:00] the more it takes control.
[40:06] The more that I can humble myself,
[40:12] the more he lifts me up.
[40:17] And every day I
[40:22] Lord I love you more
[40:29] than I surrender.
[40:32] [Applause]
[40:35] more the lighter my load.
[40:42] More that I release my case,
[40:48] more he takes control,
[40:52] [Music]
[40:54] the more that I surrender.
[40:58] [Music]
[41:01] Oh, more he lifts me up.
[41:05] [Music]
[41:07] every day.
[41:10] [Applause]
[41:11] [Music]
[41:21] And it gets easier
[41:25] to
[41:26] understand
[41:28] the road I'm traveling down.
[41:34] No more wondering
[41:37] or wavering.
[41:41] I'm standing on solid
[41:44] ground.
[41:46] Now I know I'm headed to my future home.
[41:53] The voice I hear is yours alone. Every
[41:59] day I live.
[42:03] Lord, I love you more.
[42:09] More than I surrender,
[42:14] Lord. The light of my love.
[42:21] The more that I release my care,
[42:28] the more he takes control,
[42:31] [Music]
[42:33] the more I humble my
[42:42] lift me up.
[42:46] Oh,
[42:50] I
[42:52] Lord, I love you more.
[43:01] The problems I had on yesterday
[43:06] are mere stepping stones to a higher
[43:11] place.
[43:13] Those trials that seem so awome to me
[43:19] are now my banners of victory.
[43:25] And I know I'm headed to my future home
[43:31] voice.
[43:33] Hear yours alone.
[43:37] Every day I live.
[43:40] Lord, I love you more.
[43:50] [Applause]
[43:58] The more that I release my
[44:05] Oh boy. He takes control.
[44:09] [Music]
[44:21] He lifts me up and every day I
[44:29] lord.
[44:33] [Music]
[44:40] [Applause]
[44:44] Oh my, what a wonderful atmosphere
[44:48] to receive the word of God. Are you
[44:50] enjoying the presence of God?
[44:52] Amen. Turn around and shake somebody's
[44:53] hand. Welcome them to the house of God,
[44:56] to the camp of the king.
[44:58] Amen. We want you to feel welcome. Amen.
[45:01] Feel at home among friends, among the
[45:04] family of God. You know, one of the
[45:06] things that that Balam knew that he
[45:09] couldn't overcome, he said, he told
[45:12] Balo, he said, "You don't understand."
[45:13] He said, "Why can't you curse him?" He
[45:15] said, "You don't get it." Said, "The
[45:16] shout of a king's among them." How the
[45:19] shout of the king is here today. There's
[45:21] no devil, not enough devils. Amen. In
[45:24] all creation to hinder the presence of
[45:26] God. Are your hearts open now? Ready for
[45:28] the word of God? Appreciate all the
[45:30] specials. I appreciate all the singing.
[45:32] Amen. And uh but now we come to that all
[45:35] most important part. Amen. That the
[45:38] hearing, the receiving, and then then
[45:41] you know the preacher can be anointed in
[45:44] the back. Prophet said he can be ever so
[45:46] anointed. So, but if he walk out here
[45:48] and the Holy Spirit feel that resistance
[45:51] that he just won't move.
[45:52] Amen.
[45:53] He just won't move. How many want to
[45:54] make the king welcome today?
[45:56] Say, Lord, whatever's in your word,
[45:58] whatever I have need of, bring it across
[46:00] this pullpit. We saw him do miraculous
[46:03] things last night in the word and in the
[46:05] prayer line. And I just want to
[46:07] encourage all of you who came up in the
[46:08] prayer line. And I was having a hard
[46:11] time containing myself seeing the young
[46:13] people come through.
[46:14] Yes. Oh man. Is it Lord fill them
[46:18] head to toe? Hallelujah.
[46:21] Oh my. And so we want to see more of
[46:24] that. I you know we we gave the Lord a
[46:25] fair warning last night, didn't we? We
[46:27] said, "Hey, tomorrow, that's today.
[46:29] We're going to need your new mercies
[46:31] again. We're going to need a fresh kill
[46:33] of the word. We're eagles. We got to
[46:35] have fresh kill of the word." And I
[46:37] believe that the Lord is faithful to
[46:39] that. I know he's here. I know he is. I
[46:42] know he comes to anoint the word. So I
[46:44] just want to invite you today to open up
[46:46] your heart and mind as we invite brother
[46:48] Andrew to come. It's been a wonderful
[46:51] today's our fourth service and I wish we
[46:53] could put a say how many more would you
[46:55] like to have? Well, we got four. Put a
[46:57] zero behind it and I'd be okay. Amen.
[47:00] We've done that before. We had a 30-day
[47:03] uh 30-day youth revival, Brother Josh.
[47:06] 30 days. Yeah, we've done that one time
[47:08] way back in the day. We did 10-day
[47:10] revival. A lot of times you do three or
[47:12] four days and by the time everything
[47:13] just gets really good, it's time to
[47:15] quit. And so we've ran 10 days. We've
[47:18] ran 30 days before. I had three
[47:20] different preachers come over 30 days. I
[47:22] remember my daughter-in-law sitting
[47:23] right over here, probably 15 years old
[47:25] at the time. She said, "Wow, I can't
[47:27] believe I've been in church for 30
[47:29] straight days." I said, "Well, you have
[47:33] uh you have, sister." Amen. Amen. Praise
[47:35] the Lord. So, we're happy in the Lord
[47:38] today. And I just want Brother Andrew,
[47:40] how many wanting to take his complete
[47:41] liberty again today? Say, "Lord,
[47:44] whatever I have need of, anoint your
[47:46] servant." Amen. We're going to ask
[47:47] Brother Anthony to sing that again. I
[47:49] love Sister Brenda Lewis. What a
[47:52] treasure.
[47:52] Amen.
[47:53] What a treasure. And guess what? She's
[47:55] your eternal treasure.
[47:57] Oh, you could never lose her now. She's
[47:59] home free. Amen. That sister over there,
[48:01] if you think she wrote, my goodness, how
[48:03] many songs she had? Hundreds and
[48:05] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. and
[48:08] uh over there, man, she'll just be
[48:09] getting started. I want to hear her sing
[48:11] them again. Amen. I think brother
[48:13] Anthony does a wonderful job. Amen.
[48:15] Honoring his mother-in-law and those
[48:17] songs. Amen. As we invite Brother Andrew
[48:20] to come at this time, lead us again,
[48:22] Brother Tony. God bless you. The more
[48:24] that I spread. Oh, lift it up now.
[48:30] The lighter
[48:32] my Lord.
[48:34] Oh my. The more that I release my hand,
[48:42] the more he takes my heart.
[48:46] [Music]
[48:50] Gloria
[48:52] [Applause]
[48:53] [Music]
[48:58] and every day I live,
[49:03] Lord.
[49:05] Oh, let's sing it one more time with all
[49:07] our hearts. The more that I surrender.
[49:10] Oh,
[49:13] I surrender.
[49:16] [Music]
[49:22] Oh, yes.
[49:25] I
[49:27] release my king.
[49:30] The more
[49:33] control.
[49:38] I
[49:41] [Music]
[49:43] lift me up and every day I live.
[49:51] Lord, I love
[49:54] you more.
[49:58] Amen. How many is that your testimony
[49:59] here this morning?
[50:01] Amen. That the more you surrender, Amen,
[50:03] the lighter our load becomes. Amen. We
[50:06] want to say God bless you all this
[50:07] morning. My what a wonderful uh morning
[50:09] it is to serve the Lord. Amen. To be
[50:12] gathered together in this atmosphere of
[50:13] believers and to as brother Jason was
[50:16] speaking there about the atmosphere. I
[50:17] couldn't help but think of the prophet
[50:18] of God when he said Jesus come riding
[50:20] into town. He said and the whole
[50:22] atmosphere was charged with expectation.
[50:25] Amen. I believe as believers that we
[50:27] don't just get into the uh mood of
[50:29] expectation once a year or twice a year,
[50:31] but I believe every day of our lives.
[50:34] Amen. We're not just living under
[50:35] expectation of the next meeting or the
[50:37] next special event, but at any moment
[50:39] our bodies could be changed. And we can
[50:41] leave this dimension and go to another.
[50:43] Amen. I I believe change is upon us.
[50:46] Don't you? Amen. We say God bless you
[50:48] this morning. And if you have your
[50:49] Bibles, while you're standing, we want
[50:51] to go straight in the word. We have a
[50:53] few things here on our heart this
[50:54] morning. We just want to share with you.
[50:56] We want to invite you with us to the
[50:57] book of Jeremiah. The book of Jeremiah,
[51:00] the first chapter. And uh we want to say
[51:02] it sure has been an honor and a
[51:04] privilege to be here once again, brother
[51:06] Jason. We sure appreciate the invitation
[51:08] to come and appreciate your friendship
[51:10] and uh we got to be with you all there
[51:12] for a few days back in October uh in
[51:14] your youth camps. The Lord allowed it.
[51:16] we was able to uh come down for a few
[51:17] days there with brother Josh and got to
[51:20] uh maybe rekindle some friendships again
[51:22] and sure was an awesome time in the Lord
[51:24] and we sure appreciate the assembly here
[51:26] and sister Debbie. God bless you and the
[51:28] family and again it's good to have my
[51:30] wife and our little baby Malachi with us
[51:32] and brother Josh and sister Loretta and
[51:34] we sure appreciate brother Josh and his
[51:36] ministry and stand on this message and I
[51:39] tell you there's one thing about it.
[51:40] Amen. The Lord uh loaded that Martin
[51:43] family full of gifts. Amen. uh three
[51:45] pastors. I don't know how many of the
[51:47] kids are preachers and singers and just
[51:49] a real testimony of a family of this
[51:51] message and we sure appreciate them this
[51:54] morning. And I saw brother Jim and
[51:56] sister Linda back there. God bless you
[51:57] all this morning. Uh they've known me
[51:59] since I was a baby. Uh friends of our
[52:02] family for many, many years. So sure
[52:04] good to see you all. And of course all
[52:05] the ministers, we say God bless you this
[52:07] morning. And we just want this morning
[52:09] to bow our hearts for a word of prayer.
[52:11] How many would just say, "Lord, speak to
[52:13] me."
[52:14] Amen. I believe he's here to do that.
[52:16] Heavenly Father, Lord, thy word is true
[52:18] here this morning. And Lord, as we have
[52:21] been taught by prophet that anyone with
[52:22] physical strength can open this book and
[52:25] Lord, they can turn the pages. Lord, if
[52:28] they have good eyesight, they can find
[52:29] certain sections to read. But Lord, it
[52:32] takes your spirit to take spiritual
[52:34] strength and to open up what we're
[52:36] reading. That it might become more than
[52:38] just a letter on the page. It might
[52:40] become more than just words that we're
[52:42] reading or things that we're hearing.
[52:44] that Lord, it would become life-changing
[52:46] direction. It would become, Lord,
[52:47] life-changing instruction. And Lord, as
[52:50] we have sung the songs of Zion, every
[52:52] song that has been sung, Lord, just an
[52:53] anointing upon it, Father, Lord,
[52:56] creating the atmosphere now that your
[52:57] word could come forth without
[52:59] reservation.
[53:00] Lord, without restriction, Lord, I pray
[53:03] that you would send grace upon this
[53:04] meeting. Father, you see all the sick
[53:06] and needy among us, Lord. I believe that
[53:08] you already healed them 2,000 years ago.
[53:11] Father, this morning, may their body
[53:13] become subject to what you done 2,000
[53:15] years ago at Calvary. Lord, for those
[53:17] that are bound, I believe you delivered
[53:19] them 2,000 years ago at Calvary. May
[53:21] their bodies become subject to that
[53:23] deliverance this morning. And Lord, may
[53:25] you send this spirit of revelation in
[53:27] the building, Lord. That we, Father, as
[53:29] we have heard it said uh several years
[53:31] ago in a sermon by our brother, brother
[53:32] Reagan, Lord, we want to be charged for
[53:35] the present, but oh God, we want to be
[53:37] changed for the future. And Lord, we're
[53:39] asking you this morning. May you charge
[53:41] us for these present days and hours
[53:43] ahead. But Lord, may you change us
[53:45] eternally for the future. Oh God. Lord,
[53:47] may it be another Emmas road walk here
[53:49] this morning. That when we would leave
[53:51] the place, we would say, "Did not our
[53:53] hearts burn within us? Not as as brother
[53:55] Andrew talked to us or brother Jason,
[53:57] Lord, but as you talked to us along the
[53:59] way. And we'll be sure to give thee all
[54:01] the praise, all the honor, and all the
[54:03] glory. For it's do thy wonderful name,
[54:05] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[54:06] pray." And all the believers says,
[54:09] "Amen and amen." The book of Jeremiah,
[54:12] the first chapter, and we want to look
[54:13] here in the fourth verse.
[54:16] The Bible here says, "Then the word of
[54:19] the Lord came unto me, saying, Before I
[54:22] formed thee in thy belly, I knew thee,
[54:25] and before thou camest forth out of the
[54:26] womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained
[54:29] thee a prophet unto the nations." Then
[54:32] said I, Lord God, behold, behold, I
[54:34] cannot speak, for I am a child. But the
[54:37] Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a
[54:39] child, for thou shalt go to all that I
[54:41] shall send thee, and whatsoever I
[54:43] command thee, thou shalt speak. Be not
[54:46] afraid of their faces, for I am with
[54:48] thee to deliver thee, sayaith the Lord.
[54:50] But then the Lord put forth his hand and
[54:52] touch my mouth. Now watch this. And the
[54:54] Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my
[54:57] words in thy mouth. So these are no
[55:00] longer the words of Jeremiah. They are
[55:02] now the words of God speaking through
[55:04] Jeremiah. See, I have this day set thee
[55:08] over the nations, over the kingdoms. Now
[55:10] watch. To root out and to pull down and
[55:13] to destroy and to throw down, to build,
[55:15] and to plant. So amen. Jeremiah is not
[55:18] going to physically do this with his
[55:20] hands. He's not going to tear down,
[55:21] destroy physically. But the word that is
[55:24] in his mouth has the power to tear down,
[55:27] to pull down, to root out, to destroy,
[55:29] to throw down. But the same word that is
[55:32] seasoned with the power to destroy is
[55:34] the same word that is anointed to build
[55:37] and to plant. So, so the same word that
[55:39] destroys is the same word that
[55:41] establishes. Now, I want to look also in
[55:43] the book of Daniel, the ninth chapter.
[55:45] The book of Daniel, the 9th chapter. And
[55:48] we just have some things here uh this
[55:50] morning on our heart that by the grace
[55:51] of God we can tie together in Daniel the
[55:54] 9th chapter and in the first verse of
[55:58] Daniel 9. I believe that as you read the
[56:00] book of Daniel we could very well say
[56:02] it's a book of revelation from the New
[56:04] Testament in the Old Testament. It's a
[56:05] book of symbols the same as the book of
[56:07] Revelation. In Daniel 9:1, it says, "In
[56:10] the first year of Darius, the son of
[56:12] Assurus, of the seed of the Mes, which
[56:15] was made king over the realm of the
[56:17] Chaldans." Now, in the first year of his
[56:20] reign, I Daniel understood by books. I,
[56:24] Daniel, understood by books the number
[56:27] of the years whereof, the word of the
[56:29] Lord came to who?
[56:31] Jeremiah the prophet, that he would
[56:33] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[56:36] of Jerusalem. And he says,"I set my face
[56:39] unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and
[56:42] supplication with fasting and sackcloth
[56:45] and ashes." So whatever Daniel was
[56:47] reading had the power to move him into
[56:50] desperation to where he would actually
[56:52] begin to seek the God who made the
[56:54] promise to fulfill the promise. He said,
[56:56] "I set my face with sackcloth and
[56:58] fashion uh fasting and ashes, amen,
[57:01] towards the Lord in prayer." Now, I want
[57:04] to look in one other place in John the
[57:06] 15th chapter, and I want to pull a word
[57:08] out of John uh 15 and:e 16. Y'all y'all
[57:12] have to forgive me. Uh sometimes I think
[57:13] I might get a reputation of reading a
[57:15] lot of opening scriptures. Uh but I I
[57:18] personally enjoy studying the Bible
[57:19] under the voice of the seventh angel.
[57:21] Amen. And seeing him tie scriptures
[57:23] together. In John 15 and verse 16, Jesus
[57:28] says, "Ye have not chosen me, but I have
[57:31] chosen you." Now, here's that word and
[57:34] ordained you. The same word he used with
[57:35] Jeremiah, he's now using with the
[57:37] church. And ordained you that you should
[57:39] go forth, you should bring forth fruit
[57:42] and that your fruit should remain and
[57:44] whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in
[57:47] my name, he may give it to you. Amen. We
[57:50] ask the Lord this morning to add the
[57:51] blessing to the reading of his word as
[57:53] you can be seated. I also want to say
[57:55] it's been a real honor to be with
[57:56] brother Brad and sister Sarah. Thank you
[57:58] all for all the hospitality and taking
[58:01] uh very good care of us and all the food
[58:02] and amen. Uh we got a representation of
[58:05] Tennessee down here. Amen. We sure love
[58:08] brother Brad and Sister Sarah and the
[58:09] family. God bless you all this morning.
[58:11] And I want to hear uh by the help of the
[58:14] Lord just to speak to you for a few
[58:15] moments. And I want to title this
[58:17] ordained to the message by the spirit.
[58:20] Ordained to the message by the spirit. I
[58:23] I personally believe, amen, that the
[58:25] hour has come as men of God, as
[58:27] preachers of the word, amen, to preach
[58:29] the people into a higher height of the
[58:32] word of God and to deeper depths. I I
[58:34] believe the time has come that God is
[58:36] not uh leaving us just shallow
[58:38] Christians, just just church members,
[58:40] just going to church. But I believe the
[58:42] hour has come, amen, that the word is
[58:44] bringing us stability in the church.
[58:46] Now, uh, as ministers, I believe we have
[58:48] been commissioned by a vindicated
[58:50] prophet. Amen. That we are to establish
[58:52] the people in the word and the word in
[58:54] the people. We're not to establish
[58:56] ourselves. Brother said, "The problem
[58:58] today is we're trying to establish
[58:59] ourselves in the hearts of the people,
[59:01] but we are commanded to establish the
[59:04] word of God, which Paul said, I didn't
[59:06] come to you with enticing words of men
[59:08] that your faith might rest up in the
[59:10] knowledge of man." Amen. But I come to
[59:12] you in power and manifestations of the
[59:14] Holy Ghost. Amen. that your faith might
[59:17] rest in God. Amen. Peter would say that
[59:19] you would be established in the present
[59:21] truth. So the hour is not come to
[59:23] establish the church in a doctrine or
[59:25] just in a creed or just in an idea, but
[59:28] the hour I believe has come, amen, to
[59:30] establish the church in the word
[59:32] teachings of what a vindicated prophet
[59:34] has said about the hour that we're
[59:36] living in. Now I I just maybe share this
[59:38] with you where some inspiration come for
[59:40] this all in 1965. Does God ever change
[59:43] his mind about his word? Brother Bramman
[59:45] is there ordaining ministers. And he
[59:47] says here in paragraph 42, he says,
[59:49] "Does anybody know brother Merlin Anon
[59:51] now? Uh, brother brother Jason, you
[59:53] might have known Brother Merlin, a
[59:54] pastor there in Louisiana. Actually,
[59:56] Brother Rodney Payne uh there in
[59:58] Louisiana, I believe, is a part of what
[59:59] used to be brother Merlin's church years
[1:00:01] ago. He said, "Brother Brother Merlin
[1:00:03] here, he is new to me uh with the
[1:00:05] Salvation Army. Do you remember me?"
[1:00:07] Brother said, "Oh, yes, I do, brother."
[1:00:09] He said, "Right, you're from the
[1:00:10] Salvation Army. I didn't I didn't
[1:00:12] recognize you at first. your face didn't
[1:00:13] look familiar to me at this time. He
[1:00:15] says, "But how many knows this man to be
[1:00:17] a man of God?" Everybody says, "Amen."
[1:00:19] He said, "How many believes that God is
[1:00:21] working with him?" Then raise your hand.
[1:00:23] They said, "Amen." Will you pray for
[1:00:24] him? Amen. He says, "Now, brother, we
[1:00:27] know that you're coming from a great
[1:00:28] group of people, the Salvation Army.
[1:00:30] Great group of people. They do a great
[1:00:32] work out on the street. And we can say
[1:00:34] nothing against the Nazarene, the
[1:00:36] Pentecostal Church, or the Salvation
[1:00:38] Army, or any of them. They are our
[1:00:40] brethren." So here comes brother Merlin.
[1:00:43] Amen. From the Salvation Army. And the
[1:00:45] prophet of God says we can say nothing
[1:00:46] against them. They're our brethren. He
[1:00:48] said, "But you see, we believe that we
[1:00:50] are carriers of a great message for this
[1:00:53] very hour." Amen. That we're living in.
[1:00:55] He said, "Do you want to do that with
[1:00:56] us?" And brother Anthony says, "Amen."
[1:00:59] Amen. Now, if you study through, and I'm
[1:01:01] not going to read them all to you, but
[1:01:02] if you study through several different
[1:01:04] ordinations of the prophet of God
[1:01:06] ordaining men to preach, Amen. He's
[1:01:08] making it very clear that he is
[1:01:10] ordaining them to preach this message.
[1:01:12] He's not ordaining them to further the
[1:01:15] work of the Salvation Army. He's not
[1:01:17] ordaining them to further the creeds or
[1:01:19] the traditions of the Pentecostal
[1:01:20] church. Amen. He's not Amen. Excuse me.
[1:01:24] He's not even ordaining them to continue
[1:01:26] in the Nazarene doctrine. He is showing
[1:01:29] them that I am ordaining you to preach
[1:01:31] the message of the hour. Now, now you
[1:01:33] all know if a Baptist ordains a Baptist,
[1:01:35] he's ordaining him to fulfill, Amen, and
[1:01:38] to continue Baptist doctrine. If a
[1:01:40] Methodist ordains a Methodist, he's
[1:01:42] ordaining him to continue in Methodist
[1:01:44] doctrine. Amen. But Brother Brandham was
[1:01:46] ordaining men, amen, to preach Christ as
[1:01:49] he has been revealed through this end
[1:01:51] time message. Let me just say this. I'm
[1:01:53] not here, Amen, to blast what the
[1:01:55] Pentecostals are doing. I'm not here to
[1:01:58] blast what the Baptist or the Methodist
[1:02:00] or Amen. They've got their place. They
[1:02:01] can do as they feel, work as they feel.
[1:02:03] Amen. But there's an ordination upon the
[1:02:06] life of this bride. Amen. And that is to
[1:02:08] preach and to believe the message of the
[1:02:11] hour. Amen. That is not revealing a
[1:02:13] present or revealing a past day Jesus.
[1:02:16] Amen. But is revealing a living God.
[1:02:18] Listen. Amen. I believe that we are
[1:02:20] carriers of a great message. And this
[1:02:22] message, amen, has not come from
[1:02:24] Jeffersonville. It has not come from the
[1:02:26] Arizona. It has not come from a seminary
[1:02:29] or from a school. Amen. But this message
[1:02:32] has come from God. Amen. From heaven
[1:02:34] itself. Remember said talk about
[1:02:36] perseverance. Speaking of Moses, he
[1:02:38] walked right up in the face of Pharaoh
[1:02:40] and said, "Let them go." Why? He had
[1:02:42] talked face to face with God until he
[1:02:45] had his commission. He said, "I think if
[1:02:48] ministering brethren today would just
[1:02:49] not take it from an intellectual
[1:02:51] standpoint." Amen. but would find them a
[1:02:53] place on the back side of the desert on
[1:02:55] the sacred stands where Satan cannot
[1:02:57] place his dirty feet of unbelief and
[1:03:00] they will stay there until a message
[1:03:02] comes from God. Amen. And positionally
[1:03:05] places you in the ministry. Amen. Then
[1:03:07] all the devils out of torment could not
[1:03:09] shake you from it. Amen. Because you
[1:03:12] know that you have been called. Now you
[1:03:14] say, "Well, Brother Andrew, I'm not a
[1:03:15] preacher. I'm not an evangelist. I'm not
[1:03:17] a pastor." Amen. But watch a prophet
[1:03:20] turn a corner and say, "I think each
[1:03:22] Christian ought to do that." Amen.
[1:03:24] Before you come out and confess the Holy
[1:03:26] Ghost, the baptism, there ought to be
[1:03:28] such a personal contact with God until
[1:03:30] the intellectuals in the world could not
[1:03:33] explain it from you. Amen. You've been
[1:03:35] there. You've had the witness and you
[1:03:36] know it so. Amen. You have received the
[1:03:39] power from God on high. Let me just go
[1:03:41] ahead and say this. I can't help what
[1:03:43] others do. I can't help what other men
[1:03:45] say. I can't help what other preachers
[1:03:47] preach. Amen. But as for me and my
[1:03:50] house, Amen. We have been ordained to
[1:03:52] the message of the hour. Amen. And the
[1:03:54] way a prophet said it is the way I'm
[1:03:56] going to say it. Amen. The way a prophet
[1:03:58] approached it is the way I'm going to
[1:04:00] approach it. The way a prophet placed it
[1:04:02] is the way I'm going to place it. Amen.
[1:04:04] Listen, time is running out. Amen.
[1:04:06] America is falling apart. Amen. Judgment
[1:04:09] clouds are gathering over this world.
[1:04:11] Amen. At any minute, the prophet said,
[1:04:13] "This nation could be atomic fire."
[1:04:15] Amen. but unto you that will receive the
[1:04:17] son of righteousness. He will arise with
[1:04:20] healing in his wings. And he will fly
[1:04:22] over the church. And as he flies over
[1:04:24] the church, amen, he is releasing a
[1:04:26] message to the church. Amen. Let me just
[1:04:28] go and say it. You're not a bunch of
[1:04:30] weak, beat down, hopeless, helpless.
[1:04:32] Amen. Church members in Buford, South
[1:04:34] Carolina. Amen. But God who is rich in
[1:04:36] mercy. Amen. Has sent you a message in
[1:04:38] this hour. And it's a message of vision.
[1:04:41] It's a message of answer. It's a message
[1:04:43] of anointing. It's a message of power.
[1:04:46] Amen. Amen. Amen. Can we agree? We are
[1:04:48] ordained to the message.
[1:04:51] And I get a witness here today. We are
[1:04:53] ordained to the message. Amen. If we are
[1:04:55] ordained to the message, Amen. Then I'll
[1:04:58] say this. We are responsible for a
[1:04:59] message. The prophet of God said, "I
[1:05:01] don't want to hurt feelings." Amen. But
[1:05:03] I am responsible for a message. And that
[1:05:06] message is come out of this mess. Amen.
[1:05:09] the message you've been ordained to and
[1:05:11] the message a prophet was responsible to
[1:05:14] God to bring to this generation. Amen.
[1:05:16] Was come out of this mess. And if I ask
[1:05:19] you to come out, Amen. then where am I
[1:05:21] going to take you when I take you to
[1:05:22] Brandham Tabernacle? It's got as much
[1:05:24] fault as any of the rest of them. Amen.
[1:05:27] But there's one place I can take you.
[1:05:29] Amen. Where you are safe and protected
[1:05:31] from death. And that's in Jesus Christ,
[1:05:33] God's place of worship. Amen. Then this
[1:05:36] message was not leading you. Amen. from
[1:05:38] one mess to another. It was not leading
[1:05:41] you from one bondage to another. Amen.
[1:05:43] But this message was leading you, amen,
[1:05:46] from the chaos of religion. Amen. From
[1:05:48] the confusion of man's ideas, from the
[1:05:50] traditions of society, from the
[1:05:53] traditions of religion. Amen. This
[1:05:55] message was a guide. Amen. It was a star
[1:05:58] that appeared to lead you into the
[1:06:00] presence of Jesus Christ. Listen, God's
[1:06:02] tabernacle, amen, is where he will meet
[1:06:04] with his worshippers and his worshippers
[1:06:06] will meet with him. And we have not been
[1:06:08] ordained to stay out. We have been
[1:06:10] ordained to come in. Amen. We've not
[1:06:13] been ordained to stay out of the
[1:06:14] presence. We have been ordained to come
[1:06:16] in his presence. I I love what Jeremiah
[1:06:19] 15 says. Amen. Before I formed thee in
[1:06:21] the belly, I knew thee. And before thou
[1:06:24] camest forth out of the womb, I
[1:06:25] sanctified thee and ordained thee. Amen.
[1:06:27] A prophet of the nation. Somebody say
[1:06:29] ordain thee.
[1:06:31] Ordain thee. Amen. Now look at this word
[1:06:34] ordained. It means to give, bestow,
[1:06:35] grant, permit, ascribe, employ, devote,
[1:06:38] consecrate, dedicate, exchange, lend,
[1:06:41] commit, entrust, give over. It means to
[1:06:44] yield produce. Remember said Jeremiah
[1:06:46] before he was even brought from his
[1:06:48] mother's womb. Amen. God said he knew
[1:06:50] him, sanctified him, ordained him a
[1:06:53] prophet over the nation. Amen. Before he
[1:06:55] ever come from his mother's womb. Amen.
[1:06:58] So Jeremiah was not born. Amen. and God
[1:07:01] come down in the birthing room and look
[1:07:03] at Jeremiah and say, "Man, amen. That
[1:07:05] looks like a man I can use. That that
[1:07:07] looks like somebody I can ordain." Amen.
[1:07:09] To carry my word. Amen. But before he
[1:07:12] was ever even conceived, amen, in his
[1:07:14] mother's womb, amen, the almighty
[1:07:17] sovereignty of God, amen, called him,
[1:07:19] ordained him, sanctified him, and
[1:07:22] positionally placed him, amen, as a
[1:07:24] prophet over the nation. Listen, I want
[1:07:26] to say this. Jeremiah was born in the
[1:07:29] world. Amen. And he didn't find a
[1:07:31] specific purpose. He was born for a
[1:07:33] specific purpose. Amen. And the Bible
[1:07:35] says, Amen. As many as received him, to
[1:07:38] them gave he power. Amen. To become the
[1:07:40] sons of God, even to them that believe
[1:07:42] on his name. Watch how they were born
[1:07:44] not of the will of flesh, nor of the
[1:07:47] will of man. Amen. But of the will of
[1:07:49] God. Amen. Listen. You were not born of
[1:07:52] the will of flesh. You were not born of
[1:07:54] the will of man. Amen. You have been
[1:07:55] reborn by the will of God. And that will
[1:07:58] of the blood of God has enlightened you
[1:08:00] that you were born for a specific
[1:08:02] purpose now. Amen. I don't have time to
[1:08:04] go through the Bible. Amen. Is it okay
[1:08:06] to preach this morning?
[1:08:09] Is that okay? Amen. I don't have time to
[1:08:11] go through the Bible and find all the
[1:08:13] places where God shows you. Amen. He had
[1:08:15] a specific purpose for his children.
[1:08:17] Amen. But I do want to show you a few.
[1:08:19] Amen. If you look at Moses, Amen. God
[1:08:21] raised up a man by the name of Moses and
[1:08:23] borne him in this world. Amen. For a
[1:08:26] specific purpose. And that specific, now
[1:08:28] there's a difference in a purpose and a
[1:08:30] specific purpose. Amen. And that
[1:08:32] specific purpose, amen, was to deliver
[1:08:34] the people that were in bondage that
[1:08:36] couldn't help themselves. You look at
[1:08:38] Israel, brother said God chose Israel
[1:08:40] for one select or one specific purpose
[1:08:42] that the blood of Israel would be the
[1:08:44] cleanest bloodstream. Amen. For out of
[1:08:47] that lineage was going to come the
[1:08:48] Messiah himself. Amen. So the specific
[1:08:51] purpose over, Amen. the Israelite
[1:08:54] bloodstream was that the Messiah, Amen,
[1:08:56] would come out of that bloodstream.
[1:08:58] Amen. Now, we can leave Moses and Israel
[1:09:00] and let's go to Jesus. He said, "No man
[1:09:02] come to me except the father draws him
[1:09:04] first." See, it's nothing you can do
[1:09:06] about it. Jesus didn't come to Calvary,
[1:09:08] amen, to die for a half-hazard purpose.
[1:09:11] He didn't come there and say, "Well,
[1:09:12] maybe I'll die. It'll be so pathetic.
[1:09:15] Some people will see I died and maybe
[1:09:17] they'll come and serve the Lord." Amen.
[1:09:19] But Jesus come for a specific purpose
[1:09:22] and it was to redeem those who God by
[1:09:24] fornowledge. Amen. Had elected to come
[1:09:27] to him. Amen. Then there is a
[1:09:29] connection. Amen. But between the
[1:09:31] specific purpose of Jesus, Amen. and the
[1:09:34] specific purpose of you. As a matter of
[1:09:36] fact, this bride, amen, was the specific
[1:09:39] purpose of almighty God. Amen. When he
[1:09:42] sent Jesus to the cross, listen friends,
[1:09:44] Moses had a specific purpose. Israel had
[1:09:47] a specific purpose. Jesus had a specific
[1:09:50] purpose. Amen. But I'm just going to go
[1:09:51] ahead and tell you, you are here, Amen,
[1:09:53] for a specific purpose. You're not just
[1:09:56] here to take up a pew in Bethl
[1:09:58] Tabernacle. You're not just here to pay
[1:10:00] taxes and fulfill a career. Amen. But
[1:10:02] you are here, Amen, for a specific
[1:10:05] purpose. Amen. And this purpose didn't
[1:10:07] come from your father. And it didn't
[1:10:09] come from your mother. It didn't come
[1:10:10] from your job. It didn't come from a
[1:10:12] school. Amen. But this purpose came from
[1:10:15] the presence of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:18] God didn't make you just to see if he
[1:10:20] can make you. Amen. He made you for a
[1:10:22] purpose. Amen. You are here not to be
[1:10:24] just another human being. You are here
[1:10:27] because God made you for some purpose.
[1:10:29] You are here for a specific purpose.
[1:10:31] Then no matter how little you are, how
[1:10:34] big you are, how important you are, how
[1:10:36] unimportant you are, you are here to
[1:10:38] serve a purpose. No matter how big you
[1:10:41] are, little important, unimportant.
[1:10:43] Amen. You are here to serve a purpose.
[1:10:45] He said, "See, if we were put here for a
[1:10:47] purpose, then there is nothing that can
[1:10:49] destroy us until God's purpose is
[1:10:52] fulfilled. If we are put here for a
[1:10:55] purpose, there is nothing that can
[1:10:57] destroy us until the purpose that God
[1:11:00] placed us here is fulfilled." Amen.
[1:11:02] Nothing can harm us until the purpose
[1:11:05] God put us here has been made manifest.
[1:11:08] No matter what trouble we have, what
[1:11:10] heartaches or sorrows we go through.
[1:11:12] Amen. All there's a reason for it. Now I
[1:11:15] want to say at you like this. What God
[1:11:16] calls you to be. Amen. You'll be. Thank
[1:11:19] you, brother. Amen. You didn't know you
[1:11:21] was coming preached, but you are. Look
[1:11:22] at somebody next to you and say, "What
[1:11:24] God called you to be
[1:11:26] is what you're going to be. What God
[1:11:29] called you to be is what you're going to
[1:11:30] be." Remember said, "If God wants you to
[1:11:32] be a certain thing, then he brings you
[1:11:34] to this earth to be it, and you'll be
[1:11:36] it." In other words, you cannot outrun,
[1:11:39] Amen, the divine call of God. Amen. If
[1:11:42] he called you to the earth to be a
[1:11:43] preacher, you're going to be it. If he
[1:11:45] called you to the earth to be an
[1:11:47] overcomer, you're going to be it.
[1:11:48] Whatever purpose that God called you
[1:11:51] upon the earth to be, you're going to
[1:11:52] be. Amen. Because God's call comes by a
[1:11:55] divine call. And can I tell you what I
[1:11:58] believe by the word, Amen, that God has
[1:12:00] called you, Amen, and ordained you by
[1:12:02] the spirit to this message. Amen. Your
[1:12:05] specific purpose upon this earth, Amen,
[1:12:08] is this message. Amen. Your purpose of
[1:12:10] living ought to be this message. Your
[1:12:12] purpose of being ought to be this
[1:12:14] message. Amen. Listen. Amen. There's a
[1:12:16] hundred preachers in the world today.
[1:12:18] There's millions of preachers. Amen. But
[1:12:20] there's a difference in a preacher and a
[1:12:21] message preacher. Amen. There's millions
[1:12:23] of churches across the land. Amen. But
[1:12:26] there's a difference in a church and a
[1:12:27] message church. And you know what the
[1:12:29] difference is? Amen. One has put Christ
[1:12:32] on the outside. Amen. But the other has
[1:12:34] received the Isa of Revelation 3. Amen.
[1:12:37] to receive Christ in their midst. And
[1:12:39] when Christ comes in the church, he
[1:12:41] comes in the form of divine presence.
[1:12:43] Come on, church. He comes in the form of
[1:12:46] divine presence. And when he comes into
[1:12:48] the church and you recognize his
[1:12:50] presence, then you release his power.
[1:12:52] Brother preached an entire sermon called
[1:12:54] the unrecognized presence of God. Amen.
[1:12:56] Showing you he can be here. But if you
[1:12:58] don't recognize him, you'll never
[1:13:00] receive from him. Amen. But the very
[1:13:03] minute you recognize that Jesus Christ,
[1:13:05] the son of God, is not in a tomb in
[1:13:08] Jerusalem, but he's here in supreme
[1:13:10] authority, you will recognize his
[1:13:13] presence. And when you recognize his
[1:13:15] presence, you will release his power.
[1:13:17] Amen. To fulfill the desires of your
[1:13:20] heart. Listen, I think we can say away
[1:13:22] with empty services. I think we can say
[1:13:24] away with empty sermons. I say with this
[1:13:26] message, we can say away, amen, with
[1:13:28] just meaningless gatherings of people.
[1:13:30] But there has come a word in this
[1:13:32] generation and it's a word of
[1:13:34] fulfillment. It's not a partial
[1:13:36] realization. It's a perfect realization
[1:13:39] that the God of the Bible has stepped
[1:13:41] from the pages again and he's walking in
[1:13:43] the midst of his church.
[1:13:46] I'm not a crazy man. I got a purpose on
[1:13:48] my life. And the purpose upon my life is
[1:13:51] the message. And the message has
[1:13:53] revealed to me that I am back in
[1:13:55] position with God to ask anything I
[1:13:58] desire, anytime I desire it. And if my
[1:14:00] heart is right and sin doesn't condemn
[1:14:03] me, then I've got a right to petition my
[1:14:06] father.
[1:14:08] Well, glory to God. I don't know what
[1:14:11] message you received, but I tell you
[1:14:12] what John said. He said, "This is the
[1:14:14] message which we have heard of him and
[1:14:17] we declare unto you." So, they didn't
[1:14:18] receive the message and then put it on a
[1:14:20] bookshelf. But what they received, they
[1:14:22] declared. And what they declared was
[1:14:24] there is no darkness in God at all. It's
[1:14:27] all light. Amen. What they were
[1:14:29] declaring was the days of darkness is
[1:14:31] over. Go listen to your rise of the sun.
[1:14:34] Amen. And for the first time, Amen. from
[1:14:36] the dead dark denominationalism. There
[1:14:38] will come forth a message that the full
[1:14:41] word will be waved over the people
[1:14:42] again. And for the first time, he says,
[1:14:45] in the bride coming of Christ, there
[1:14:47] will come forth for a bride age. Listen
[1:14:49] friends, Paul has had his time. Moses
[1:14:52] has had his time. Peter has had his
[1:14:54] time. William Brandom has had his time.
[1:14:56] Amen. that this is your time. Amen. This
[1:14:58] is your anointing. Amen. This is your
[1:15:01] season. Amen. Paul ran his race. Amen.
[1:15:03] Jesus even come on the earth in a
[1:15:05] corporal body and ran his race. Amen.
[1:15:08] But now we have heard the voice coming
[1:15:11] from the finish line. Amen. Lay aside
[1:15:13] every weight. Lay aside every sin and
[1:15:16] run the race with patience that is set
[1:15:18] before you. Listen, I propose to you
[1:15:20] this morning that we're not just
[1:15:21] starters. Amen. But we're finishers. I
[1:15:24] propose to you this morning that there's
[1:15:26] a bride who's not going to come up
[1:15:28] short. She's not going to come up
[1:15:30] lacking, but she has received, Amen. a
[1:15:33] message that'll release a strength in
[1:15:35] her and she'll cross the finish line.
[1:15:40] Hallelujah. It's the word of God. It's
[1:15:42] the strength. Amen. Coming in the
[1:15:44] church. Amen. This is the message.
[1:15:47] We've heard of him, Brother Joe. There's
[1:15:49] no darkness in him. It's all light.
[1:15:52] Amen. There's no weakness in him. It's
[1:15:54] all strength. There's no sadness in him.
[1:15:57] It's all joy. There's no doubt in him.
[1:16:00] It's all faith. And I'll just go ahead
[1:16:02] and say it. There is no turning around
[1:16:04] in him. It's forward, forward, onward,
[1:16:07] and upward.
[1:16:09] Anybody agree with me, we're going
[1:16:10] forward. We're going onward. And brother
[1:16:13] Matt, some morning between 6:00 and 9,
[1:16:15] we're going to go upward. Amen. The Holy
[1:16:18] Ghost has one message and that is speak
[1:16:21] the word and go forward. My this message
[1:16:24] then is an announcement. It is a
[1:16:26] promise. It is a blessing. Now do you
[1:16:28] realize the prophet God preaches it very
[1:16:30] beautiful why it had to be shepherds. He
[1:16:32] said the highest of heaven which was God
[1:16:34] came down to make himself known to the
[1:16:36] lowest of the earth bypassing all
[1:16:38] between to make himself known to common
[1:16:40] herdsmen coming to give these common
[1:16:42] herdsmen. Amen. The greatest message of
[1:16:45] all times. They thought their purpose,
[1:16:48] Amen brother, Amen, was to fulfill,
[1:16:51] Amen, the tending of sheep. But little
[1:16:53] did they realize, brother brother Kenny,
[1:16:55] there was another purpose on their life.
[1:16:58] And that was not a purpose of tending
[1:16:59] sheep. Amen. But it was to be the
[1:17:02] announcers. Amen. Of the greatest
[1:17:04] message of all time and the great learn,
[1:17:06] kings, potentates, monarchs. But here he
[1:17:09] comes. Amen. With the greatest of all
[1:17:11] the messages. You say, "What is the
[1:17:13] message?" The message the shepherds
[1:17:15] declared was Messiah is here now. So
[1:17:18] God, brother Chris didn't go get the
[1:17:20] kings. He didn't go get the potentates.
[1:17:22] He didn't go he didn't go s through the
[1:17:25] seminaries and find somebody that had a
[1:17:27] polished vocabulary to go declare he was
[1:17:30] here. But he went brother Jason to the
[1:17:31] mountains and he found some sheep that
[1:17:34] were tending their or some shepherds
[1:17:35] tending their sheep and he got a hold of
[1:17:37] them and he declared to them Messiah is
[1:17:40] here. And they ran into the city. Amen.
[1:17:42] declaring Messiah is not just coming.
[1:17:44] Amen. But Messiah is here. Oh, how can I
[1:17:47] hold my peace? When I look across this
[1:17:49] building this morning and I see a bunch
[1:17:51] of nobodies, you're hearing from a
[1:17:53] nobody. We're a bunch of nobodies.
[1:17:55] Rejects. Amen. Outcast of society. Amen.
[1:17:58] But God who is rich in mercy. Amen.
[1:18:01] Bypass. Amen. More polished people. But
[1:18:03] he placed a seed in your soul by the
[1:18:06] fornowledge of God. And he give you a
[1:18:08] courage to say that the Messiah is not
[1:18:10] coming. Amen. But the Messiah is here.
[1:18:13] Listen, friends. Amen. God has chose
[1:18:15] nobody's, amen, to declare his message
[1:18:18] in this age. He don't need your ability.
[1:18:21] He just needs your surrendered heart
[1:18:23] that'll say, "Yes, it's the truth." If a
[1:18:25] prophet said it, he doesn't need your
[1:18:27] education as a preacher. He needs your
[1:18:30] voice to just say what a prophet said
[1:18:32] and watch the dynamics of the Holy
[1:18:34] Ghost. Amen. Strike the mechanics in the
[1:18:37] church.
[1:18:38] [Applause]
[1:18:40] Hallelujah. Amen. It's a message of a
[1:18:42] king. It's a message of power. It's a
[1:18:45] message of announcement that Christ is
[1:18:47] in his church.
[1:18:49] Messiah is here. Come on, church. Amen.
[1:18:52] I'm just going to preach to you since
[1:18:53] I'm here. Messiah is here.
[1:18:57] Messiah is here. And if he's here, we
[1:18:59] ought to make him welcome.
[1:19:01] I said if he's here, we ought to make
[1:19:03] him welcome. When an announcement is
[1:19:06] made that Christ is in the church, we
[1:19:08] ought to make him welcome. Brother
[1:19:10] Jason, I know you know about this. You
[1:19:12] You've been overseas hundreds of times,
[1:19:13] probably thousands. Amen. You know about
[1:19:15] it. You go overseas, you come out on the
[1:19:17] platform, there's all these all these
[1:19:19] foreign eyes looking at you. You've
[1:19:21] never met him, never shook their hand.
[1:19:22] And the pastor gets up and says, "We've
[1:19:24] got I I've had it happen to me over in
[1:19:26] Africa." One time, pastor gets up and
[1:19:28] says, "We got Brother Andrew Glover all
[1:19:30] the way from America. Come over here to
[1:19:32] preach the gospel. Got saved when he was
[1:19:34] nine. Got the Holy Ghost when he was 12.
[1:19:36] Started preaching when he was 13. Amen.
[1:19:38] Married. got a family. I mean, all these
[1:19:40] things. And then all of a sudden,
[1:19:42] they'll go through some of the things
[1:19:43] about you and then they'll say, "Now,
[1:19:45] let's make him welcome." And then all of
[1:19:47] a sudden, people will stand up and they
[1:19:49] will begin to clap. And they will do
[1:19:51] everything they can because they want
[1:19:53] you to feel that they're happy that you
[1:19:56] come, amen, to visit them. Well, let me
[1:19:58] just say this. I did not come here this
[1:20:00] morning, amen, to introduce myself. I
[1:20:02] didn't come here this morning, amen, to
[1:20:04] give you my resume of where I've been
[1:20:06] and what I've done and what I've
[1:20:08] preached. Amen. But I did come here to
[1:20:09] tell you, amen, that God has sent a
[1:20:11] message. And it's the message of the
[1:20:13] Messiah. Amen. And he is a God who's
[1:20:15] walked on water. He has stopped funeral
[1:20:18] possessions. He has raised the dead. He
[1:20:20] has stopped storms. He has opened
[1:20:22] blinded eyes. He has unbound dumb
[1:20:24] tongues. He has opened the ears of the
[1:20:26] dead. Amen. And he's here this morning.
[1:20:28] Then you know what? I say make him
[1:20:30] welcome. Amen. We ought to make him
[1:20:32] welcome here. We ought to welcome the
[1:20:35] Messiah into the church and welcome him
[1:20:38] with his power and his deity and all of
[1:20:41] his glory. He's here, friends. We ought
[1:20:44] to make him welcome. We ought to welcome
[1:20:46] him in the front. We ought to welcome
[1:20:47] him in the back. We ought to welcome him
[1:20:49] in our young people. We welcome this
[1:20:51] message to come into the church and to
[1:20:54] free the captive.
[1:20:58] This is not a man. This is a scriptural
[1:21:00] message. And a prophet said, "This le
[1:21:03] oysian age is supposed to receive a
[1:21:06] message."
[1:21:08] The le oyssey age is supposed to receive
[1:21:12] a message. Who said they would? Malachi
[1:21:15] 4.
[1:21:16] So that tells me then we have, brother
[1:21:19] Joe, a scriptural message. Now I said it
[1:21:22] to you like this. What the prophet said,
[1:21:23] he said, "We have a message for this
[1:21:26] day. We believe that God has given us a
[1:21:29] message now. Amen. It just comes to me,
[1:21:30] so I'm just going to pick it up while
[1:21:32] it's here. Amen. I think it's a
[1:21:33] downright shame. Amen. That for the
[1:21:35] first time in 2,000 years, we finally
[1:21:38] got a five-fold ministry on the earth
[1:21:40] that's got something to say. And we got
[1:21:42] a bunch of fanatics. Amen. Tell them
[1:21:44] just push play now. Come on, church.
[1:21:47] Amen. For years, Amen. Come on now. For
[1:21:49] years, they didn't have nothing to say.
[1:21:51] It was a bunch of feelings and emotions
[1:21:52] and I feel and I sense. Amen. But God
[1:21:55] released a message and now they're
[1:21:57] saying don't preach it. Amen. But I tell
[1:21:59] you, the only people you'll get to shut
[1:22:01] up is a bunch of hierlands. Amen. But
[1:22:03] you'll never get a man of God to shut
[1:22:05] up. Amen. Because you didn't hire him
[1:22:07] and you cannot fire him. He was called
[1:22:09] on the sacred sands. His feet stood
[1:22:12] where Moses stood and he will not shut
[1:22:14] up and he will not lay his Bible down
[1:22:16] and quit. Amen. Because he is recognized
[1:22:18] in this message was the revealing of his
[1:22:21] purpose. Oh, brother said, "What is it?"
[1:22:23] He said people say what is this term you
[1:22:25] use message of the hour. He said here it
[1:22:27] is. It's God's promise of this hour. So
[1:22:30] if you hear the term what is the message
[1:22:32] of the hour? You can automatically say
[1:22:34] it's God's promise for this hour. It's
[1:22:36] not a man. It's not a denomination. It's
[1:22:39] God's scriptural promise for the age
[1:22:41] you're living in. Remember said in
[1:22:43] recognizing your Danish message. Do you
[1:22:45] see the message of the hour? Can you
[1:22:47] recognize where we are? The message
[1:22:50] itself. Somebody say itself from the
[1:22:53] scripture interprets to you the hour
[1:22:55] that we're living in. The message itself
[1:22:58] from the scripture interprets to you the
[1:23:01] hour we're living in. How many can agree
[1:23:03] with me? Amen. That reading this message
[1:23:06] is like reading the morning paper
[1:23:09] before you actually see the morning
[1:23:11] paper. Now come on. Amen. You can read
[1:23:14] this message and then go look in society
[1:23:16] and you don't need to read the newspaper
[1:23:19] because the message already said the way
[1:23:21] it would be. Come on. He already told us
[1:23:23] the time would come that there would be
[1:23:24] a Sodom law coming into effect. Come on.
[1:23:27] Amen. Amen. We should not be we should
[1:23:28] not be alarmed. Amen. So much that
[1:23:30] they're shooting up schools. Amen. Cuz a
[1:23:32] prophet said in the 50s and 60s, Amen.
[1:23:35] that this world is one degree from total
[1:23:37] insanity. He said, "Boy, go in the
[1:23:39] schools. Shoot up the schools." Amen.
[1:23:41] Are you hearing me? This message is not
[1:23:43] a coincidence. This message is not a
[1:23:45] throw it out there and see if it
[1:23:47] happens. Amen. This message is a divine
[1:23:49] interpretation, amen, of the age and the
[1:23:52] season that you're living in. And I say
[1:23:54] this evening, friends, amen, this bride
[1:23:56] is not a bunch of helpless, hopeless
[1:23:57] church members. Amen. She has got a
[1:23:59] ministry.
[1:24:01] Proph will the bride have a ministry
[1:24:04] before the rapture? He said, sure,
[1:24:06] that's going on right now. See the bride
[1:24:09] of Christ certainly brother Luther what
[1:24:11] is her ministry? He said it's the
[1:24:13] message of the hour. The ministry of the
[1:24:16] bride is the message of the hour. You
[1:24:19] say then what is the message of the
[1:24:20] hour? It is the promise to see Jesus.
[1:24:24] Over 20 sermons can we see Jesus? No man
[1:24:27] can hear about God unless something
[1:24:29] desires to see him. Amen. Amen. Can we
[1:24:32] see Jesus? Come on, Zakius. Amen. You're
[1:24:34] going to climb up a sycamore tree, but
[1:24:36] in your heart there is a desire. Amen. I
[1:24:39] want to see Jesus. Amen. Y'all y'all
[1:24:41] forgive me. I heard it said one time.
[1:24:42] Amen. They said them sycamore trees are
[1:24:44] slick as slick as I don't know what.
[1:24:46] They said, you know why? Because Zakius
[1:24:48] skinned that thing down coming down.
[1:24:50] Amen. Amen. He climbed up the tree.
[1:24:52] Amen. He got up there and you know what
[1:24:54] he said? He found where two limbs come
[1:24:56] together and he met in the trunk of the
[1:24:59] tree and there he sat down. He said,
[1:25:01] "Now, that's a good place to sit where
[1:25:03] two ways meet. See, yours and God's,
[1:25:05] your idea and his." That's a good time
[1:25:07] to sit down and think it over. Amen.
[1:25:10] Your own thoughts about him and what his
[1:25:12] word says he is or what you think he is
[1:25:15] and what the word says he is. A good
[1:25:17] place to sit down and watch what the
[1:25:19] message of the hour is to your thinking
[1:25:22] and what the message of the hour is to
[1:25:24] his word. Yeah,
[1:25:26] it's a good place to sit down and see
[1:25:29] what the message of the hour is to your
[1:25:31] thinking and what the message of the
[1:25:33] hour is to his word. That's the
[1:25:35] difference. See, now can I just tell you
[1:25:37] what I believe? I believe the message is
[1:25:39] Christ.
[1:25:41] Brother said in the toolken 61 or 63, he
[1:25:44] said we're not come together to talk
[1:25:45] about the message. We are coming
[1:25:47] together to get in the message. Amen.
[1:25:50] And the message is Christ. Anybody tell
[1:25:53] you this message is anything different?
[1:25:54] Show him this quote and say what a
[1:25:56] prophet said. The message is Christ and
[1:26:00] Christ is the word. That's right. Amen.
[1:26:02] Then we are to get into it. We are to
[1:26:05] get beneath it. So the message is Christ
[1:26:08] and we are to get into the message. We
[1:26:11] are to get beneath the message. Brother
[1:26:13] said what is the message of the hour?
[1:26:14] Amen. It is apply the token. So there is
[1:26:17] a connection between the token and the
[1:26:20] message. You go read Exodus 12 and the
[1:26:22] very first part you'll read, I will pass
[1:26:24] through the land of Egypt. Amen. Watch
[1:26:27] what he's saying. I will pass through.
[1:26:29] Amen. But drop down a few verses. And he
[1:26:31] says, "And I will pass over you and the
[1:26:34] plague shall not be upon you." Amen. So
[1:26:36] he's going to pass through the land.
[1:26:38] Amen. And he's going to pass over those,
[1:26:40] Amen. who are under the token of the
[1:26:43] message of the hour that they're living
[1:26:44] in. In other words, Amen. He will pass
[1:26:47] over you because you're under the token.
[1:26:50] Amen. If you want him to pass through
[1:26:51] you, Amen. Get out from under the token
[1:26:54] and try to get above the token and he'll
[1:26:56] pass over you and he'll smite you with
[1:26:58] the death angel. Amen. But if you'll get
[1:27:00] underneath the blood, if you'll get
[1:27:02] underneath a message, when the death
[1:27:04] angel begins to swirl throughout the
[1:27:05] land, he will not pass through you. He
[1:27:08] will pass over you. Amen. Because
[1:27:10] whatever you're under, amen, cannot be
[1:27:12] afflicted by the death angel. And I say,
[1:27:15] "Thank God, in this hour when they're
[1:27:17] talking about atomic bombs, they're
[1:27:18] talking about World War II, we have
[1:27:21] received a bomb shelter, and it's the
[1:27:23] feathers of the eagle." And we can lead
[1:27:25] our families into it. And we can say,
[1:27:27] "Let the bombs fall." That's a rumors
[1:27:29] warm. Amen. Let the war bells ring. We
[1:27:32] are underneath a protection of the
[1:27:34] provision of God in the age we're living
[1:27:36] in.
[1:27:38] Oh yeah. Friends, this message is not
[1:27:40] something that ought to be looked at
[1:27:41] casually. It's our protection. It's our
[1:27:44] headship said he only recognizes the
[1:27:46] token. That's the message of the hour.
[1:27:49] That's the message of this day. That's
[1:27:50] the message of this time in the name of
[1:27:52] Jesus Christ. Receive it. Receive what?
[1:27:55] Receive the token.
[1:27:58] Receive it, brother. Receive the token.
[1:28:01] Now, now, now you want you want me to
[1:28:02] show you that somebody under the token
[1:28:04] is safe. We can talk about Rahab.
[1:28:07] Come on, brother. Said Rahab. Amen. He
[1:28:09] said, "You cannot read the Bible and not
[1:28:11] believe in predestination." Uh, brother
[1:28:12] Jason. Brother JD, sorry. I'll get it
[1:28:14] right in a minute. Jason, JD, what do
[1:28:17] you go by? Either one. Okay. Amen. I sit
[1:28:20] in the back room there listening. Amen.
[1:28:22] Reading, preparing for the service and
[1:28:23] hearing him talk about where I'm going.
[1:28:25] Amen. Predestination. How many can raise
[1:28:27] your hand and say, "Thank God for it.
[1:28:29] Thank God for this message. Thank God
[1:28:31] for a prophet that revealed, you never
[1:28:33] become a son at the altar. You always
[1:28:35] was a son. The only thing the altar did
[1:28:38] was give you a place, amen, to recognize
[1:28:40] who you already was before you come to
[1:28:43] the altar. He said, see then the Bible
[1:28:45] said that Rahab perished not with them
[1:28:47] who believe not. Is that right? Amen.
[1:28:49] Why? Because she believed the message of
[1:28:52] the hour. Amen. Two messengers got in
[1:28:54] her home and they I'm just going to
[1:28:56] preach here for a second. Amen. Cuz they
[1:28:58] got in her home. And I've often wondered
[1:29:00] this. Has you have you ever thought
[1:29:01] about this? Amen. The messengers did not
[1:29:04] bring the token. It was already in there
[1:29:06] unrecognized.
[1:29:08] They did not bring her a cord and say,
[1:29:10] "Here is your token. Take the token."
[1:29:12] Amen. And hang it out the door. Now,
[1:29:14] now, Brother Chris, you know what I'm
[1:29:15] talking about. Amen. You go through your
[1:29:16] house and do a spring cleaning. Amen.
[1:29:18] And there are certain things you say,
[1:29:19] "Get rid of. We don't need that." How
[1:29:21] many times did she look at that little
[1:29:23] red string and say, "We ought to get rid
[1:29:25] of that. It's not doing any good." But
[1:29:26] something would not let her throw it
[1:29:28] away. Something would not let her throw
[1:29:30] it out in the spring cleaning. Amen.
[1:29:32] Because underneath the message of
[1:29:34] Joshua, Amen, that cord, amen, changed
[1:29:37] from a red cord into the salvation of
[1:29:39] her home and her family and everything
[1:29:42] that was underneath it. And what did she
[1:29:44] say? She said, "What do I do?" They
[1:29:46] said, "Whatever you get underneath this
[1:29:48] token, when Jer when Jericho comes down,
[1:29:51] when the walls are destroyed, whatever
[1:29:53] is underneath this token, Amen,
[1:29:55] destruction will not come n." And the
[1:29:57] prophet of God said, "Rahab went to
[1:29:59] work." Amen. And you know what I think
[1:30:01] it's time to do? I think it's time to go
[1:30:03] to work. I think it's time to get our
[1:30:04] prodals in. I think it's time to get our
[1:30:07] babies in. I think it's time to get our
[1:30:08] weward loved ones in. Come on, church.
[1:30:10] Amen. There's a destruction coming.
[1:30:12] Amen. But there's a provision that has
[1:30:15] been made for this generation.
[1:30:18] Get under the token children. Get under
[1:30:20] the toolken family. A and I love what
[1:30:23] says now. He said, "Then when the war
[1:30:25] broke out," he said, "And Rahab looked
[1:30:27] out the window and she saw what was
[1:30:29] going on." He said she was not nervous.
[1:30:31] He said while the walls were falling,
[1:30:34] while the war was going on, she was
[1:30:36] inside reading the scriptures.
[1:30:40] She was in the house reading the
[1:30:42] scriptures. You know why? Amen. Because
[1:30:45] the message of the hour was you get
[1:30:47] under the token and when destruction
[1:30:49] passes through the land. Amen. It will
[1:30:51] not come naive. And she fulfilled that
[1:30:54] by obeying the voice of the messenger in
[1:30:56] the age she was living. Listen friends,
[1:30:58] I don't know about you. Amen. But God
[1:31:00] who is rich in mercy has sent another
[1:31:02] token into this generation. It is not
[1:31:05] the chemical. It is not the literal
[1:31:07] blood of Jesus. But it is the life that
[1:31:09] was in the blood. And the token is none
[1:31:12] other than the life of Jesus Christ
[1:31:14] coming back in the church in display in
[1:31:17] full effect. Come on church. Without
[1:31:19] this blood, Amen, the covenant is
[1:31:21] enulled. Amen. But with this blood,
[1:31:24] amen, the covenant is put into effect.
[1:31:26] And everything in the covenant is yours
[1:31:28] under the blood.
[1:31:31] Now, now you all will agree with me,
[1:31:32] won't you? That God is perfected in
[1:31:34] threes, right? Father, son, holy ghost.
[1:31:37] Amen. Water, blood, spirit. God is
[1:31:40] perfected in threes. What is three? It's
[1:31:42] the number of perfection. Amen. Then can
[1:31:44] I say this to you? Amen. This message,
[1:31:46] which I believe is a perfect message,
[1:31:48] has come to us in three pools.
[1:31:51] The message of the hour has come to the
[1:31:54] church in three pools. Now, I did a
[1:31:56] study on this. I don't have time to go
[1:31:57] through the whole study. Amen. But I
[1:31:59] just want to share a few parts here with
[1:32:00] you. In 1962, is this the sign of the
[1:32:03] end, sir? Brother said, "Is this that
[1:32:05] third pull that he told me three or four
[1:32:07] years ago?" First pull, remember I tried
[1:32:08] to explain it. He said, "Don't do that.
[1:32:10] Second pull, don't try." He did. I
[1:32:12] pulled anyhow. Do you remember? He said,
[1:32:14] "But then there's a third pull coming."
[1:32:16] Can we say this together? There's a
[1:32:17] third pull coming. There's a third pull
[1:32:20] coming. He said, "But don't try to
[1:32:22] explain it." He said, "Now, do you see
[1:32:24] how I approach this tonight? I don't
[1:32:26] know, but I feel duty bound to my church
[1:32:28] to say something. You draw your own
[1:32:30] conclusion." Then watch a prophet a few
[1:32:32] paragraphs later turn and go to John
[1:32:34] 14:12 and say, "The works that I do more
[1:32:38] than this shall you do." He said, "I
[1:32:39] know King James says greater, but we
[1:32:41] couldn't do greater. It's more of it."
[1:32:43] See, he was in one person then. He's in
[1:32:46] the whole church now.
[1:32:49] He's in one person then. He's in the
[1:32:51] whole church now. Now I'm I'm I'm just
[1:32:53] going to preach if that's okay. I
[1:32:55] personally believe the days of big time.
[1:32:58] Amen. Personalities are over.
[1:33:01] Pray this. Okay. Take a little liberty.
[1:33:03] I believe I believe it's over. I believe
[1:33:05] that we've come to a time where it's not
[1:33:07] a I did this and I prayed and I said and
[1:33:10] I laid hands on. Amen. But I believe
[1:33:12] we've come to a time where it's a body
[1:33:14] move. Then come on church. Amen. If if
[1:33:16] if I get a victory, come on. If we're on
[1:33:18] a team, then everybody on the team gets
[1:33:20] the victory. Amen. If brother Jason gets
[1:33:22] a victory, Amen. then I get the victory.
[1:33:25] You know why? Because we're on a team.
[1:33:27] Now, I'm just glad to preach since I'm
[1:33:28] here. Amen. I think our testimonies
[1:33:30] shouldn't be seasoned with so much eye
[1:33:32] syndrome.
[1:33:35] Oh, glory to God. I might as well
[1:33:37] preach. I'm here. Hat. Amen. I think our
[1:33:39] testimonies shouldn't be seasoned with
[1:33:40] well, I now come on. I've heard some
[1:33:43] testimonies, brother. Time they got
[1:33:45] done. I actually wonder, brother Ethan,
[1:33:46] was God even in the building? I mean,
[1:33:48] was God even there? Did he even do
[1:33:50] anything? Because it was so much I I I
[1:33:52] listen, this third pull is not a eye.
[1:33:54] Amen. It's a body. It's a body coming
[1:33:58] together. Amen. With one vision, one
[1:34:00] goal, one motive, one objective, and
[1:34:02] that's to slay every devil. Amen. That
[1:34:04] is contrary to what God has revealed in
[1:34:07] this age. Amen. More than this, how you
[1:34:09] do, I go to my father. See, he's in the
[1:34:11] whole church now. He said, "If this is
[1:34:13] the third pool, if this is the third
[1:34:15] pull, then there's a great ministry
[1:34:17] laying ahead." Now, watch him say, "The
[1:34:19] third pool is coming." Then he says, "If
[1:34:21] it is the third pull, then there's a
[1:34:23] great ministry laying ahead." Paragraph
[1:34:25] 392, indictment. He said, "May there
[1:34:28] come forth a revival of the just and a
[1:34:30] great power come among the church." Just
[1:34:32] before it's going, it's not hard to pray
[1:34:34] that, Lord, because you promised it.
[1:34:36] Amen.
[1:34:36] And we're looking for the third pull.
[1:34:40] Third pull is coming. I'm I'm I'm taking
[1:34:42] it on a trail. Okay. Third pull is
[1:34:44] coming. When the third pull comes, it'll
[1:34:47] be a great ministry ahead. Now, he says
[1:34:49] we are looking for the third pull that
[1:34:51] we know will do great things for us in
[1:34:53] our midst. Amen. We're not looking for
[1:34:55] the third pull. Amen. That he will do
[1:34:57] great things because the third pool is
[1:34:59] not a preacher. The third pool is the
[1:35:01] revelation of the word that has been
[1:35:03] revealed in this season. Then when the
[1:35:05] third pool comes in the church, amen,
[1:35:07] the third pool will be, Amen, the
[1:35:10] ministry of the bride. Why Christ speak
[1:35:12] paragraph 308, he said, God give me
[1:35:15] courage, amen, to take the sword of the
[1:35:17] word that he put in my hand about 33
[1:35:19] years ago and hold it and march forward
[1:35:22] to the third pull is my prayer. Okay, we
[1:35:25] got third pull is ahead. Third pull will
[1:35:27] do great things. Third pull is coming.
[1:35:29] Amen. Now there's a strength to pick up
[1:35:31] a sword, brother Brad, and to march
[1:35:33] forward to the third pole. Christ is the
[1:35:36] mystery. 1963, of course, being
[1:35:38] spiritual, you watch spiritual things,
[1:35:40] not knowing this, but God knows it. If
[1:35:42] you'll turn and look at the clock, it is
[1:35:44] on the dot 2:00. It's the end of the
[1:35:47] second pull. Amen. And the third pull is
[1:35:50] at hand. We have now come all the way
[1:35:53] from the third pull is ahead. Amen. To
[1:35:55] now the third pull is at hand. Amen.
[1:35:57] Now, come on, friends. The second pull
[1:35:59] has come to its end, but the third pull
[1:36:02] is now at hand for the church. I'm just
[1:36:04] going to have to preach since I'm here.
[1:36:05] Amen. Don't you reduce this third pull.
[1:36:08] Amen. Back down to a second pull. Don't
[1:36:10] you reduce this third pull back down.
[1:36:14] Come on, church. I can take you through
[1:36:15] the third pool and show you the triune
[1:36:17] being of who you are. In the first pool,
[1:36:20] where was the sign? It was in the hand.
[1:36:22] And what was it dealing with? It was
[1:36:24] dealing with the flesh. So, the first
[1:36:26] pool was dealing with the flesh. Where
[1:36:28] was the second pull? It was the
[1:36:29] discernment of spirits which was
[1:36:31] discerning things that were buried in
[1:36:33] spirit which is the second part of you
[1:36:36] as a human. You are a body then you are
[1:36:38] a spirit. Amen. But when you come to the
[1:36:40] third pool, it was not dealing with the
[1:36:42] flesh and the hand. It was not deal with
[1:36:44] hidden things in the spirit. Amen. But
[1:36:46] the third pull, amen, was coming to your
[1:36:48] soul. Amen. Come on, friends. I feel
[1:36:51] like preaching. Amen. We are not just
[1:36:53] flesh Christians. Come on. We're not
[1:36:56] just spirit Christians. We are soul
[1:36:58] Christians. Y'all know the prophet God
[1:37:00] said. He said we are a triune being just
[1:37:02] like father, son, holy ghost. We are
[1:37:04] body, spirit, and soul. Right? He said,
[1:37:06] now watch. Every church has three kinds
[1:37:09] of believers. Can I show you? Every
[1:37:11] believer has three kinds of believers.
[1:37:14] Every believer sitting right here this
[1:37:15] morning has three kinds of believers.
[1:37:17] Your flesh is an unbeliever. Your flesh
[1:37:20] fights you. Your flesh don't want to
[1:37:22] come to church. Your flesh don't want to
[1:37:24] raise your hand. Your flesh don't want
[1:37:25] to say amen. Your flesh don't want to
[1:37:27] play the piano. Your flesh don't want to
[1:37:29] lead the songs. Brother Jason, it's your
[1:37:31] flesh that don't want to preach
[1:37:33] sometimes. Amen. But that is a flesh and
[1:37:35] it's an unbeliever. Amen. Now, let's
[1:37:37] move to the second realm. It's a spirit
[1:37:39] and your spirit is a makeel believer. If
[1:37:41] everything's okay, no troubles, no
[1:37:43] problems, man. You're fellowshipped with
[1:37:45] angels. You're walking and talking with
[1:37:47] Gabriel. Amen. You're too anointed to be
[1:37:49] disappointed. You're too blessed to be
[1:37:51] stressed. Amen. to wake up on Monday
[1:37:53] morning and receive a bad report or a
[1:37:55] bad phone call and that spirit will go
[1:37:57] from the highs of highs to the lows of
[1:37:59] lows. Amen. And it'll tell you, amen,
[1:38:02] you ain't got no purpose. You ain't got
[1:38:04] no fe you're no value to nothing. Amen.
[1:38:06] But let's go beyond the flesh. Let's go
[1:38:09] beyond the spirit. Amen. Let's go to the
[1:38:11] real you. Amen. The real you is not an
[1:38:13] unbeliever. The real you is not a
[1:38:15] makebeliever. The real you is your soul.
[1:38:18] And your soul believes on the mountain.
[1:38:20] And your soul believes in the valley.
[1:38:22] Your soul believes when the bills are
[1:38:24] paid. Your soul believes when you're in
[1:38:26] the negative. Your soul believes when
[1:38:28] you're well. Your soul believes when
[1:38:29] you're sick. Because this message, amen,
[1:38:32] is not a fleshly message. It's not a
[1:38:34] Pentecostal spiritualism message. It's a
[1:38:37] word soul message that has come into
[1:38:41] this generation to release you from the
[1:38:43] chicken coupe and to set you in the
[1:38:45] heavenlies.
[1:38:47] Hallelujah. We're not just Christians
[1:38:49] when we feel like it. We're Christians
[1:38:51] when we don't.
[1:38:54] That's why the devil hates us. It's cuz
[1:38:55] we'll shout on the valley and we'll
[1:38:57] shout on the mountain. That's why the
[1:38:59] devil can't stand us is when he's thrown
[1:39:01] everything at us to quit. We find our
[1:39:04] place in the house of God and say,
[1:39:06] "Greater is he that is in me than he
[1:39:09] that is in the world."
[1:39:13] We're so Christians.
[1:39:16] We don't believe based on the way things
[1:39:18] are going. We believe based on the word.
[1:39:23] We serve it from our soul.
[1:39:26] Y'all feel that right now? That's
[1:39:27] devil's backing up. That's demon powers
[1:39:30] backing up because the real you has
[1:39:32] received the third pull.
[1:39:35] [Music]
[1:39:37] Oh, glory to God.
[1:39:39] You know what I tell that devil? I tell
[1:39:41] that devil, if he was going to get me,
[1:39:43] you should have got me when you had a
[1:39:44] chance.
[1:39:46] If you was going to get me, you should
[1:39:48] have got me when you had a chance. You
[1:39:50] lost your chance, devil. Some of y'all
[1:39:53] right now need to tell that devil, if
[1:39:55] you was going to get my family, you
[1:39:57] should have got them when you had a
[1:39:58] chance to get them. Amen. But you don't
[1:40:00] have a chance to get them because the
[1:40:02] blood's done got them. And I have been
[1:40:04] taught the same faith. Amen. I can
[1:40:06] believe for myself. I can believe for my
[1:40:08] children. Come on, church. Where's that
[1:40:10] coming from? That's coming from your
[1:40:11] soul. Amen. Where is that strength
[1:40:13] coming from? It's coming from your soul.
[1:40:16] Some of y'all right now are sitting
[1:40:18] here, Sister Watkins. Amen. You're
[1:40:20] sitting here under expectation of seeing
[1:40:22] your husband appear. Where is that
[1:40:24] strength coming from? It's not coming
[1:40:26] from her flesh. It's not coming from her
[1:40:28] spirit. Brother Jason, it's coming from
[1:40:30] her soul. Can I preach? Amen. One of
[1:40:33] these days, amen, you're going to see
[1:40:35] your daddy. You're going to see your
[1:40:37] brother. They're going to come walking
[1:40:39] into this dimension. You know how
[1:40:41] they're going to do it? Because the word
[1:40:43] has released your soul from the grip of
[1:40:45] your flesh, from the grip of your
[1:40:47] spirit. Amen. To see the fulfillment of
[1:40:49] the divine message.
[1:40:53] It's not a fairy tale. It's a reality.
[1:40:57] It's a reality.
[1:40:59] This is not my imagination. This is thus
[1:41:02] sayith the Lord.
[1:41:05] Believe from my soul.
[1:41:08] Now come on, friends. From that soul.
[1:41:11] That's why you can sing when you don't
[1:41:13] feel like it. Cuz your soul's got a song
[1:41:19] from your soul. Come on, young people. I
[1:41:22] love to shout. I love to dance. And
[1:41:25] listen, I'll dance my shoe heels off
[1:41:26] with you. But you better get more than
[1:41:28] the Holy Ghost on your flesh.
[1:41:31] You better get it more than in your
[1:41:33] spirit. You better get the true baptism
[1:41:35] of the Holy Ghost on your soul.
[1:41:38] When the camp atmosphere is gone and the
[1:41:41] youth meeting friends are not there, if
[1:41:43] this word has taken control of the
[1:41:45] control tower of your soul, then there's
[1:41:48] no bad thing anybody can say, it'll turn
[1:41:50] you around. Come on. I believe this
[1:41:53] third pull has released a power like the
[1:41:55] sirenian woman in this church, in this
[1:41:58] bride body. Satan, you can do everything
[1:42:01] you want and will still be here. But
[1:42:03] what about Jesus? What about Jesus? Can
[1:42:05] he call you a dog and you still show up?
[1:42:08] Can he tell you you're not worthy to
[1:42:10] hear what you're hearing and you still
[1:42:12] show up? Do you know why? Amen. Because
[1:42:14] you're a Christian from your soul.
[1:42:19] [Applause]
[1:42:20] Now, the prophet of God said that third
[1:42:22] pull is at hand. You know what at hand
[1:42:25] means, brother Joe? It means nearby. It
[1:42:28] means readily accessible when needed. It
[1:42:30] means close in time. It means it's about
[1:42:33] to happen. Daniel 12, seal up the book.
[1:42:35] Revelation 1:3. Amen. Deceal
[1:42:45] not the sayings of this prophecy for the
[1:42:48] time is at hand. We're going to say, we
[1:42:51] learned this a principle that the
[1:42:52] revelation of God can only come forth at
[1:42:55] a specific time. Listen, friends. Amen.
[1:42:58] There has to be a specific time that the
[1:43:00] revelation can come forth. And it can
[1:43:02] only come forth
[1:43:06] a specific people. Amen. Born for a
[1:43:09] specific purpose at a specific time
[1:43:12] receiving the specific revelation. May I
[1:43:15] announce to you, the prophet of God
[1:43:16] said, the third pull is beginning to
[1:43:19] move. Do you see within me? Now watch.
[1:43:22] Amen. That is the thing we look forward
[1:43:24] to. The third pull has now been
[1:43:26] vindicated. The third pull is properly
[1:43:28] identified. Look away to Jesus. The
[1:43:30] third pull is here. Come on, church.
[1:43:33] Amen. Even between that statement and
[1:43:35] the other, he took another step beyond
[1:43:38] just the third pull is moving within me.
[1:43:40] Amen. But now the third pull is here.
[1:43:43] The third pull is here. You say,
[1:43:45] "Preacher, what is it?" He said, "It's
[1:43:47] so sacred." Now watch third pull. Then
[1:43:49] see, it'll be absolutely to the total
[1:43:50] loss. To the total loss, right?
[1:43:54] Third pool, absolutely to the total
[1:43:56] loss. Amen. But it will be for the
[1:43:58] bride, the church. Come on, church.
[1:44:00] Don't you ever let some return ministry
[1:44:03] devil, Amen. tell you that the third
[1:44:05] pull is coming. According to a prophet,
[1:44:08] the third pull is here. Come on. Right
[1:44:11] now, you say, "Well, brother Andrew, the
[1:44:13] third pulls to the total loss." You're
[1:44:14] exactly right. It is to the total loss.
[1:44:16] But according to the prophet, it's for
[1:44:18] the bride. And the first time that the
[1:44:21] third pull left William Brandom, where
[1:44:23] was it exercised upon? It was not
[1:44:25] exercised upon the total loss. It was
[1:44:28] exercised upon a believer. And who was
[1:44:30] that believer? Her name was Hadright.
[1:44:34] Oh, glory to God. He said, "I know what
[1:44:36] the third pull is, and I know what it
[1:44:38] does." He said, "What is that third
[1:44:40] pull?" It's the spoken word. Shalom,
[1:44:42] Sarah Vista. We know what the third pull
[1:44:44] is. He said, "That third pull is the
[1:44:46] great and the final pull." Come on,
[1:44:48] church. We're in the great and the final
[1:44:51] pull. What was the first pull? It was
[1:44:53] healing. What was the second pull? It
[1:44:55] was prophesying. But the third pull was
[1:44:57] the opening of the word. It was the
[1:45:00] mysteries revealed. See, and there's no
[1:45:03] more higher order to reveal the word
[1:45:06] than prophets. See, and the only way a
[1:45:08] prophet can be vindicated is by the
[1:45:09] word. And remember, come on, church. And
[1:45:12] remember, the third pull is the opening
[1:45:15] of them seven seals to reveal the hidden
[1:45:18] truth that's been sealed in the word. We
[1:45:21] have just identified where this message
[1:45:24] is coming from. It is coming from the
[1:45:26] opening of the word.
[1:45:29] Can I say it to you as plain as I know
[1:45:30] how? The third pull is the message.
[1:45:34] The third pull is the message. The first
[1:45:36] pull was not the message. It was a
[1:45:39] preparation year. The second pull was
[1:45:41] not the message. It was another
[1:45:42] preparation year. Amen. But the third
[1:45:45] pull is the message. He said, "I've got
[1:45:47] my mind set on this message." That's
[1:45:49] that third pull. It's the one I must be
[1:45:52] loyal and reverent to.
[1:45:55] Well, glory to God. People say, "Well,
[1:45:57] Amen. Don't preach that third pool." I
[1:45:59] say, "Then what in the name of God are
[1:46:00] you going to preach?" Amen. Don't go in
[1:46:02] them seven seals. Well, what are you
[1:46:03] going to preach? Amen. This message is
[1:46:05] not Can I take some liberty? It is not a
[1:46:08] cheap reproduction of the Pentecostal
[1:46:10] circus show. This message is the literal
[1:46:13] life of Jesus Christ. Amen. Returning
[1:46:15] back in the church through the channel
[1:46:17] of the spoken word. Come on, church. You
[1:46:20] are the literal spoken word seed bride.
[1:46:23] Come on. You're not a bunch of horse and
[1:46:25] buggy drivers. You're not in a bunch of
[1:46:27] You're not a bunch of automobile
[1:46:29] drivers. You're not even pilots. You're
[1:46:31] spiritual astronauts who's got spiritual
[1:46:34] astronaut faith. You're in an astronaut
[1:46:36] age.
[1:46:37] [Music]
[1:46:39] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. What is
[1:46:41] this message? It's the opening of the
[1:46:44] word.
[1:46:45] Come on, friends. It was not under the
[1:46:47] first pool that he said, "I'm no longer
[1:46:49] going to call you church. I'm going to
[1:46:50] call you bride." It was under the third
[1:46:52] pull. Can I preach to you? So under the
[1:46:55] third pull, you will move from the
[1:46:57] church to the bride.
[1:47:02] That third pull is the opening of the
[1:47:05] word which is making the church the
[1:47:07] bride. Brother Matt, how are we the
[1:47:10] bride? We are the bride by the word.
[1:47:15] Somebody shout glory. We are the bride
[1:47:18] by the word. That feels good, don't it?
[1:47:20] We're the bride by the word.
[1:47:25] Satan, get out of here. We are the bride
[1:47:28] by the word. Come on. How are we going
[1:47:30] to take the rapture by the word?
[1:47:33] Proving his word 64. The bride will take
[1:47:36] the rapture by the word. Brother Joe,
[1:47:38] that makes me want to take my joy shoes
[1:47:40] and put them on. It makes me want to put
[1:47:42] my shouting shoes on that I am not going
[1:47:44] to take the rapture, brother Jason, by
[1:47:46] the way I feel. I'm going to take the
[1:47:49] rapture by the word.
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:52] Y'all know I'm telling you the truth.
[1:47:54] Amen, brother Aaron. Some morning
[1:47:56] between 6:00 and 9, there's going to
[1:47:57] come a cool sweep and you're going to
[1:47:59] feel that sweep come across your body
[1:48:01] and you're going to know it's not going
[1:48:02] to be long and you're going to be caught
[1:48:04] up, amen, to meet the Lord in the air.
[1:48:06] Come on, church. Do you realize on the
[1:48:08] morning of the rapture may be the worst
[1:48:10] morning of your life? You may feel
[1:48:12] horrible. You may feel lower than a
[1:48:14] snake's belly. You may feel unworthy,
[1:48:16] unloved, unvaluable. Amen. But the way
[1:48:18] you are feeling, amen, is not going to
[1:48:21] change, amen, the effect of the rapture
[1:48:23] upon your body. Whether you want to
[1:48:25] receive it or not, church, you've
[1:48:27] already been claimed for rapture. You
[1:48:29] can't outrun it. You can't hide from it.
[1:48:32] You can't fall from it. You have got a
[1:48:34] claim upon your life by the gene seat of
[1:48:36] almighty God. Your flesh has been
[1:48:38] claimed. Amen. To fulfill, Amen. the
[1:48:41] promise of Paul. Amen. Come on. Not all
[1:48:43] sleep, but some morning between 6:00 and
[1:48:46] 9, we're going to be changed.
[1:48:49] You've done been claimed for it. Come
[1:48:51] on, let's go to the Bible. You can make
[1:48:53] your bed in the belly of hell, but he'll
[1:48:55] still be there.
[1:48:58] What is this word? What is this third
[1:48:59] pull? He said it's Jesus Christ after
[1:49:02] 1900 years here tonight. He sent just as
[1:49:05] much alive tonight as she was when you
[1:49:07] talked to the woman at the whale. It's
[1:49:09] God manifested in flesh.
[1:49:12] But now somebody say now in the flesh of
[1:49:15] his bride. For the bride and the husband
[1:49:18] is the same self flesh. These two are
[1:49:22] one. And the church is becoming the
[1:49:25] bride all the time by believing the
[1:49:29] word. Don't get mad at me, but you're
[1:49:32] not going to shout your way in to be
[1:49:33] bride. You're not going to dance your
[1:49:35] way in to be bride. Come on. You can
[1:49:36] have all the dancing. Come. We can shout
[1:49:38] and dance and rejoice. and I believe in
[1:49:40] it. But that's not the avenue to put you
[1:49:43] in the bride. You become the bride by
[1:49:46] believing the word that made you bride
[1:49:51] which your identity changed under the
[1:49:52] seals. You are now a wordborn bride.
[1:49:58] The word in the church making it the
[1:50:01] bride. What is it? It's the last sign.
[1:50:03] Slap somebody on the knee and say it's
[1:50:05] the last sign. It's the last sign. You
[1:50:08] say, "What's the last sign?" God himself
[1:50:12] identified in the church by the word.
[1:50:15] Come on, friends. We're not on the brink
[1:50:18] of another church age. We're not on the
[1:50:20] brink of another age.
[1:50:23] God have mercy. I heard brother Smith
[1:50:25] preach it years ago. He preached on the
[1:50:27] threshold of millennial kingdom. I got
[1:50:29] to thinking about that, Brother Jason.
[1:50:30] Amen. What is a threshold? Amen. If you
[1:50:32] got a floor and like right there you got
[1:50:34] carpet and the next room you got
[1:50:36] hardwood. Amen. If you want to make a
[1:50:38] smooth transition. Amen. You put a you
[1:50:41] put what they call a transition strip
[1:50:43] there, you lay a transition strip
[1:50:46] between the carpet and the floor and
[1:50:49] then you just make a step.
[1:50:54] You lay a transition strip between the
[1:50:57] carpet and the hardwood and then you
[1:50:59] just make a step.
[1:51:01] In other words, if there's not a
[1:51:02] transition strip there, Sister Debbie,
[1:51:05] you could trip and stump your toe. You
[1:51:07] could fall in between the carpet and the
[1:51:09] hardwood. Amen. But if there's a
[1:51:10] transition step there, it's like you
[1:51:12] don't even know that you left one
[1:51:14] material and stepped into another.
[1:51:17] And church, the living God, don't you
[1:51:19] see what this message is? It was a
[1:51:22] transition strip between the dimension
[1:51:24] of time and the blending of eternity.
[1:51:27] Come on, church. You're not going to
[1:51:28] pray your way in this rapture. You're
[1:51:30] not going to work your way in this
[1:51:31] rapture. But one of these mornings,
[1:51:33] you're going to take a step, amen,
[1:51:35] through the transition strip. And you're
[1:51:37] going to step from mortality to
[1:51:39] immortality. You're going to step from
[1:51:41] flesh into the step, amen, from a
[1:51:45] tabernacle of humiliation, from a pest
[1:51:47] house into your father's house. This
[1:51:50] message has put the church in position
[1:51:53] to change our bodies.
[1:51:55] [Applause]
[1:51:57] It's a purpose, church, arise and shine,
[1:52:00] Bethl Tabernacle. You're going to leave
[1:52:02] here one of these days.
[1:52:05] Get your eyes off the problems. Get your
[1:52:07] eyes off of who said what, who did what,
[1:52:09] and get your eyes back on thus sayaith
[1:52:12] the seventh angel, which was thus sayith
[1:52:14] the Lord.
[1:52:15] [Applause]
[1:52:17] It's a vision.
[1:52:18] Hallelujah.
[1:52:22] Hallelujah. I wish I was out in the
[1:52:24] field right now. Hallelujah. It's a
[1:52:26] reality, friends. I'm not a crazy man.
[1:52:33] Y'all forgive me. I believe our dead
[1:52:34] loved ones are walking through this room
[1:52:36] right now.
[1:52:38] I believe they're here in another
[1:52:40] dimension.
[1:52:46] It's going to be a step. It's just going
[1:52:48] to be a change. Now, now I don't I'm
[1:52:51] here so I might as well preach.
[1:52:55] Daniel said he received Jerry. I don't I
[1:52:57] don't Let me just preach it to you, not
[1:52:59] teach it. Jeremiah said, "I received
[1:53:03] this understanding by books."
[1:53:06] Brother said, "Jeremiah is in
[1:53:07] captivity." He said, "Gabriel,"
[1:53:09] three-part series, Daniel 70 Weeks,
[1:53:11] Gabriel comes flying in to instruct
[1:53:13] Daniel in captivity about the future.
[1:53:20] Daniel, Brother Joe, is in captivity.
[1:53:23] Gabriel comes flying in to instruct him
[1:53:26] about his future while he's still in
[1:53:29] captivity. And you know what he was in?
[1:53:31] He was in a day that parallels this day.
[1:53:33] You go listen to today to uh to
[1:53:36] Gabriel's instructions to Daniel and
[1:53:38] hear the prophet of God say it like
[1:53:39] this. He says, "Daniel's day, our day.
[1:53:43] Daniel's day, our day. Daniel's day,
[1:53:46] this day." He is paralleling Daniel's
[1:53:49] day to this day. And he's showing you,
[1:53:51] Amen. Before God brings an end to
[1:53:53] something, he forewarns. Where did the
[1:53:57] revelation of the future home come from?
[1:54:00] Under the third pool, where did the
[1:54:03] rapture tape come from? Under the third
[1:54:05] pool. Where did things that are to be
[1:54:07] come from? Under the third pull. See,
[1:54:10] when God brings an end before, somebody
[1:54:12] say before,
[1:54:14] he brings an end. He forewarns. Now,
[1:54:16] when you study the Bible, you can find
[1:54:18] out there's different ways God give to
[1:54:20] mark the times.
[1:54:22] In the in the days of Lot, Lot marked
[1:54:24] the time by angels. Am I going too long,
[1:54:26] Brother Jason?
[1:54:27] Amen. Amen. I'm not going to preach all
[1:54:29] day, but I sure feel good right now.
[1:54:31] Abraham by a visitation of the angel of
[1:54:34] the Lord. Elohim marked his time. In the
[1:54:36] book of In the book of Joshua, you find
[1:54:38] Rahab. Amen. She marked her time by
[1:54:41] messengers in the days of Noah. He
[1:54:43] marked his time by revelation.
[1:54:45] Unscientific message coming to a man
[1:54:47] that was unscientific in in a scientific
[1:54:49] age. He marked his day by revelation.
[1:54:52] But if you look in Daniel 9:2, Daniel
[1:54:55] says, "I understood by books."
[1:54:59] I understood by books the number of
[1:55:01] years were of what? The word of the Lord
[1:55:04] came unto Jeremiah that he would
[1:55:07] accomplish 70 years. Amen. In the
[1:55:10] desolation of Jerusalem. Look at this
[1:55:11] word understand. It means to discern. It
[1:55:14] means to consider. It means to
[1:55:16] distinguish. It means to consider
[1:55:18] diligently. And notice what he says. And
[1:55:20] after he understood by books, he said,
[1:55:22] "I set my face toward the Lord God to
[1:55:26] seek by prayer and supplication with
[1:55:29] fasting and sackcloth and ashes." So
[1:55:31] Noah by revelation, Rahab by messengers,
[1:55:33] Abraham by Elohim, Lot by angels, but
[1:55:36] Daniel by books.
[1:55:38] Amen.
[1:55:39] Daniel marked the time of the desolation
[1:55:42] of Jerusalem by the books of the prophet
[1:55:44] Jeremiah. Remember said the vision came
[1:55:46] to him when he was in BC 538 which from
[1:55:49] 538 to 606 leaves 68 years. He had been
[1:55:53] in in Babylon amongst heathens and he
[1:55:55] still had the victory. Daniel standing
[1:55:58] alone with God held the victory for 68
[1:56:02] years. He said he had no church to go
[1:56:04] to. He had no songs to sing. He said he
[1:56:07] had no fellowship. Come on church. But
[1:56:09] still he held on to what the true
[1:56:12] prophet said 68 years. The only brother
[1:56:16] Chris consolation that Daniel had was
[1:56:19] the words of Jeremiah. The prophet of
[1:56:21] God said how that would warm the heart
[1:56:22] of any true prophet of God to look back
[1:56:25] and see what this prophet said and know
[1:56:27] we're at the end time. Now Daniel kept
[1:56:30] the victory by consulting amen the
[1:56:33] prophet of God Jeremiah's books. He
[1:56:35] said, "Then how can we spend wasteless
[1:56:37] time gambling, swimming holes on Sunday,
[1:56:39] no time for the Lord, just run down if
[1:56:41] the pastor speaks on something you don't
[1:56:43] like, get up and go out. If the church
[1:56:45] holds too long, while you're
[1:56:46] dissatisfied, he said, "Look at our
[1:56:48] condition. Look what we're doing.
[1:56:49] Compare our lives with that prophet, one
[1:56:52] man in a complete kingdom with no church
[1:56:54] to go to. It was torn down, burned down.
[1:56:57] His city, his people was captive." Amen.
[1:57:00] But 68 years he held the victory. Then
[1:57:03] tell me, I have just identified to you.
[1:57:06] Amen. Jeremiah's message was Daniel's
[1:57:09] strength
[1:57:10] in the days of Babylonian captivity when
[1:57:13] he could see the desolations. Amen.
[1:57:15] Coming up on Jerusalem, he could go back
[1:57:17] to what Jeremiah said. And Jeremiah,
[1:57:20] brother Steve, he said there'll be 70
[1:57:22] years. Now, you all know, amen, that
[1:57:24] before Daniel went in that captivity,
[1:57:26] amen, an angel met him and he then went
[1:57:28] in captivity and the angel come to him
[1:57:31] and revealed him the message. Can I sit
[1:57:33] this way in hurrying? I'm I'm I'm trying
[1:57:35] not to hurry where you're not getting
[1:57:36] it, but I'm trying to hurry. Can I say
[1:57:37] this to you? Jeremiah was ordained to
[1:57:40] bring a message.
[1:57:42] Jeremiah was ordained to bring a message
[1:57:45] concerning the future of Jerusalem. But
[1:57:48] Daniel was ordained to believe the
[1:57:50] message that Jeremiah sent. In other
[1:57:53] words, the message was written in the
[1:57:54] book. Amen. Now, when God sends a true
[1:57:56] prophet, there's always a false prophet.
[1:57:59] But here's what I love. Here's what I
[1:58:01] love. Amen. is Daniel never left. Amen.
[1:58:04] The teachings of a true word prophet.
[1:58:06] Even though someone come in and said,
[1:58:08] "Well, it should be this way. It should
[1:58:10] be that." He said, "But that's not what
[1:58:12] Jeremiah said." Now, come on, friends.
[1:58:14] You know why Daniel had this? Because
[1:58:17] the prophet of God said, "Daniel, when
[1:58:19] Gabriel appeared, oh God, he was only
[1:58:22] asking about what would happen and be
[1:58:25] determined for the Jewish race."
[1:58:28] He said, "But what he got was all the
[1:58:30] way to the consummation." Brother,
[1:58:32] Brother Josh, I love this. He asked a
[1:58:34] little bit and got the whole thing.
[1:58:39] He asked a little bit, for the Jim, and
[1:58:41] got the whole thing. Daniel was not
[1:58:44] asking for everything. He was asking for
[1:58:46] a little bit. But when he got a little
[1:58:48] bit, he got the whole thing. Now, come
[1:58:50] on. Some of y'all can fellowship with
[1:58:51] me. When you got saved, you was just
[1:58:54] asking for a little bit. You was just
[1:58:56] asking for God, Amen, to save you from
[1:58:58] being a sinner. You was just asking for
[1:59:00] God, amen, to restore your marriage or
[1:59:02] restore your children or restore this.
[1:59:05] Amen. But little did you know when you
[1:59:07] got underneath this message, the little
[1:59:09] bit you was asking for was going to
[1:59:11] bring you everything.
[1:59:13] Come on. Amen. When you got saved, you
[1:59:16] wasn't looking for the revelation of
[1:59:17] seven seals, but you got it. You wasn't
[1:59:20] looking for the truth on the Godhead,
[1:59:22] but you got it. Amen. Amen. Some of
[1:59:24] y'all wasn't looking for the seven vow
[1:59:25] revelation, but you got it. Some of you
[1:59:28] didn't even know what seven thunders
[1:59:29] were. But by the time you got underneath
[1:59:32] this third pull, underneath this third
[1:59:34] pull, you asked for a little bit and you
[1:59:37] got the whole thing. Well, church living
[1:59:39] God, I think it's high time to shout.
[1:59:41] The prophet of God said, "The true word
[1:59:43] prophet will bring the whole word.
[1:59:46] Denominations will hate him, but to
[1:59:48] those who will receive him will be ready
[1:59:51] for the rapture."
[1:59:54] Hallelujah. Brother, I may be hated, but
[1:59:56] here's the glorious thing about it,
[1:59:58] Gideon. I'm ready for the rapture. They
[2:00:00] may not like you. They may despise you.
[2:00:03] Amen. But underneath this prophet's
[2:00:05] message, you have moved. Amen. From a
[2:00:07] ticket holder to tribulation unto a
[2:00:10] bride member ready for translation at
[2:00:12] any moment, any time. Now, oh my. Can I
[2:00:15] say it to you like this? When a message
[2:00:17] come from Jeremiah, Daniel got
[2:00:19] underneath the influence of it. In other
[2:00:21] words, the Bible said, "Jeremiah, don't
[2:00:23] stay in one place. Take this message to
[2:00:25] the nations and cause them to drink, and
[2:00:28] they shall drink and be moved and be mad
[2:00:30] because of the sword that will send
[2:00:32] among them." In other words, Jeremiah,
[2:00:35] I've give you this message. Don't sit
[2:00:37] still. Don't stay in one place, but
[2:00:39] prophesy to all nations. You see the
[2:00:41] history repeating itself today. the
[2:00:43] Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, MO,
[2:00:46] whatever they might be. But Jeremiah
[2:00:48] just put the word out and made them all
[2:00:50] mad.
[2:00:53] Can I preach to you? He didn't stay
[2:00:56] home. Jeremiah didn't stay in one little
[2:00:59] spot. He made the nations to drink.
[2:01:02] Jeremiah made the nations to drink. Now,
[2:01:05] come on, friends. Because the prophet
[2:01:07] God said, "Drink what?" The wine of his
[2:01:09] word. Then you know what wine can do? It
[2:01:12] can have two different effects.
[2:01:15] Come on, brother Michael. It can have
[2:01:17] two different effects. Somebody can
[2:01:19] drink it and get mad.
[2:01:22] Somebody else drank it and get glad.
[2:01:25] Come on. Amen. Amen. Jeremiah put it out
[2:01:28] there and brother Brad, some of them
[2:01:30] drunk it and by the time they got done
[2:01:31] drinking it, they were mad and they were
[2:01:33] ready to kill Jeremiah. But the same
[2:01:35] wine was what Daniel drank. And by the
[2:01:38] time he got done, he received a
[2:01:40] refreshing from the presence of the Lord
[2:01:42] because the wine is the stimulation of
[2:01:45] revelation. And it only comes, amen, by
[2:01:48] the power of the preaching of the
[2:01:50] message of the hour you're living in.
[2:01:52] Listen, this wine is doing more than
[2:01:54] just making us shout and dance. It's
[2:01:55] bringing us under an influence.
[2:01:58] Now, come on. I'm closing here in a
[2:02:00] minute, but it's bringing us under
[2:02:00] influence. What is it doing? It's moving
[2:02:03] you from just being a citizen of Bufort
[2:02:06] or wherever you live. It's moving you
[2:02:08] into being a prophetic class of people.
[2:02:11] Come on church. That's why the devil
[2:02:13] can't stop you. Amen. Is because the
[2:02:15] force of prophecy can never be defeated.
[2:02:18] Re said watch. He said therefore this
[2:02:21] book has to be understood. Amen. By a
[2:02:23] prophetic class of people. Then the
[2:02:25] Bible says it like this. In the last
[2:02:27] days we're going to receive a message.
[2:02:29] And brother said by that message we are
[2:02:32] given the understanding by the word that
[2:02:34] we are going to understand it. Listen in
[2:02:36] the last days under the third pull
[2:02:39] message of the hour we have received an
[2:02:41] understanding by the opening of the
[2:02:43] word. We didn't just get a little bit we
[2:02:45] got the whole thing.
[2:02:48] Come on church. If you want me to prove
[2:02:49] it to you I can. Amen. Brother Joe, how
[2:02:51] do you know? Amen. Amen. We're not just
[2:02:54] marking the time by one thing. We're not
[2:02:56] just marking it by angels. Brother Brad,
[2:02:58] we're not just marking it by revelation.
[2:03:00] Brother Ethan, we're not just marking
[2:03:01] it. Amen. By books. Amen. But this bride
[2:03:04] is marking the time by the angels, by
[2:03:07] Elohim, by the messengers, by the
[2:03:09] revelation and by the books. What are
[2:03:12] you saying? I'm saying if there's ever
[2:03:14] been a time to get your head out of Dr.
[2:03:16] Dobson, if there's ever been a time to
[2:03:19] get your face out of John Hag and Fox
[2:03:21] News and get your head back in these
[2:03:23] books. Amen. is the understanding to the
[2:03:26] age you're living in. And without this
[2:03:28] message, we are as confused as 6 billion
[2:03:31] people on the face of the earth. But
[2:03:33] with this message, in the captivity of
[2:03:36] Leosa, we have received an understanding
[2:03:39] by the word.
[2:03:42] Oh, I don't have time to say all of
[2:03:43] them, but I tell you what a prophet
[2:03:44] said. He said, "I understand my books. I
[2:03:47] understand my books." Listen, we're
[2:03:48] living in a prophetic time. What are you
[2:03:51] saying? I'm saying we're influenced by a
[2:03:53] prophetic message, which means we have
[2:03:55] come under prophetic utterance.
[2:03:58] Say that with me. Prophetic utterance.
[2:04:00] Prophetic utterance.
[2:04:01] I'm trying to get this horse in the
[2:04:02] barn.
[2:04:05] We've come under prophetic utterance. In
[2:04:08] other words, our words are no more our
[2:04:10] words.
[2:04:12] In other words, our words are no more
[2:04:14] the words of Andrew. They're no more the
[2:04:16] words of Chris. If you're under this
[2:04:18] message,
[2:04:20] your words have become his words. See,
[2:04:23] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:04:25] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[2:04:28] mystery of God should be what? Finished.
[2:04:31] As he had declared to his servants, the
[2:04:34] prophets said, "Look, obey this
[2:04:36] prophetic utterance." If you want a
[2:04:38] change to your situation, obey the
[2:04:41] prophetic utterance. Prophetic utterance
[2:04:43] said, "Apply the token." Prophetic
[2:04:46] utterance said kick out the television.
[2:04:48] Come on, church. Prophetic utterance
[2:04:49] said get the right kind of clothes on.
[2:04:51] Prophetic utterance said wash the paint
[2:04:53] off. Prophetic utterance said put a
[2:04:55] skirt on that fits and a pair of pants
[2:04:57] that look like a man. Come on, boys.
[2:04:59] Prophetic utterance cleaned house.
[2:05:01] Prophetic utterance said, "Amen. Don't
[2:05:03] go anywhere you wouldn't take Jesus."
[2:05:05] Prophetic utterance said, "When you see
[2:05:07] an immorally dressed woman, turn your
[2:05:09] head." Prophetic utterance said, "In the
[2:05:11] last days, women will bob off their
[2:05:12] hair." Prophetic utterance said they'll
[2:05:14] be heady high-minded lovers that listen.
[2:05:16] I know it ain't popular to say these
[2:05:18] things. You tell me I already know it,
[2:05:19] but I'm going to say it anyhow. Remember
[2:05:20] said, "Clean the house." Amen. Kick out
[2:05:22] the high heel shoes. Come on, church.
[2:05:25] Well, I might as well preach. I'm this
[2:05:26] far into it. When in the name of God we
[2:05:28] start allowing our young girls to wear
[2:05:30] makeup.
[2:05:32] Well, come on, church. You know what's
[2:05:34] the truth? I tell you why it's crept
[2:05:35] back in. Amen. Because Hollywood is
[2:05:38] trying to dress our girls. Amen. that I
[2:05:40] stand here and I defy every demon in
[2:05:42] Hollywood and say they have no right to
[2:05:44] dress our young ladies and they have no
[2:05:46] right to dress our young boys. We are
[2:05:49] dressed by the prophet's teachings in
[2:05:51] this age. We ought to dress our girls.
[2:05:53] We ought to dress our boys. And come on
[2:05:55] elders, we ought to dress ourselves.
[2:05:56] Amen. The way the prophet of God said we
[2:05:58] ought to look. He said we shouldn't wear
[2:06:00] paint. We ought to go home and throw it
[2:06:02] out. He said we shouldn't wear high heel
[2:06:04] shoes. We ought to go home and throw
[2:06:05] them out. He said we shouldn't have a
[2:06:07] television or home. We ought to get a
[2:06:09] backbone and get a shotgun and blow that
[2:06:12] devil back to the hell he come out of
[2:06:14] and make way for the revelation of the
[2:06:16] understanding of the word of God to come
[2:06:18] back in our homes.
[2:06:23] Well, it's the truth anyhow.
[2:06:25] I said it's the truth anyhow. Me and my
[2:06:28] wife was some other day we were
[2:06:29] somewhere in a bunch of people around
[2:06:31] around a message event. I looked at my
[2:06:32] wife, honey, forgive me. I looked at my
[2:06:34] wife. I said, "Does nobody preach on
[2:06:36] makeup no more?" She said, "Why you say
[2:06:38] that?" I said, "Obviously, they ain't
[2:06:39] cuz everybody's wearing it." Come on,
[2:06:42] church. You know why they're wearing it?
[2:06:43] Because some hireling that didn't have
[2:06:45] the guts to stand with a prophet said it
[2:06:47] was okay.
[2:06:50] Well, I'm here. I might as well preach
[2:06:51] that now. Are you hearing me? You know
[2:06:53] why the things are coming back in? It's
[2:06:55] because we've lost our guts. Amen. To
[2:06:57] say what a prophet said because it looks
[2:06:59] a little impopular. It looks a little
[2:07:01] What is it? Politically correct. Amen. I
[2:07:03] don't care about being politically
[2:07:05] correct in a condemned hellbound
[2:07:07] generation. But unto you that have
[2:07:10] received this message, it ought to
[2:07:11] change the way you dress. It ought to
[2:07:13] change the way you look. It ought to
[2:07:15] change the way you talk.
[2:07:19] Well, it's a truth anyhow. Shout out to
[2:07:21] me, oh my, or something.
[2:07:23] Clean up the house. I understand by
[2:07:26] books that there's a world coming to an
[2:07:28] end, but there's a bride.
[2:07:30] There's a bride who's not going to get
[2:07:32] out of there. Listen, you might get out,
[2:07:34] but the prophet said, "Get back in."
[2:07:37] [Music]
[2:07:38] Now, I know people don't like prophetic
[2:07:40] utterance, but I can't help it. It's the
[2:07:41] truth anyhow.
[2:07:44] Well, I'm here, so I might as well
[2:07:45] preach that now. When did our 16, 18
[2:07:47] year old boys start wearing shorts
[2:07:49] again?
[2:07:52] Come on. When did they start wearing
[2:07:53] short? I'll tell you. When a bunch of
[2:07:55] polished, educated, uncalled, unanointed
[2:07:58] men invaded a pull pit and said, "They
[2:08:00] got a right to dress like the world.
[2:08:02] They got a right." Amen. I tell you what
[2:08:03] that is. That's a devil. But you know
[2:08:05] what? You ought Come on. Some of y'all
[2:08:07] right now get mad at me, but I don't
[2:08:08] care. I'm giving you a space to repent.
[2:08:11] I'm giving you the courage by the word.
[2:08:13] Amen. To pick up your sword and cut that
[2:08:15] devil of Passion's head off. Cut that
[2:08:18] devil of Hollywood's head off. Come on,
[2:08:19] church. I understand by books that this
[2:08:22] bride will be a clean bride. She'll be a
[2:08:24] holy bride. She'll be an unprovable
[2:08:26] bride. She'll be an unblamable bride.
[2:08:29] She will be a wife of Jesus Christ
[2:08:31] undefiled.
[2:08:33] [Applause]
[2:08:35] Oh, I know what I'm talking about. Them
[2:08:36] devils creep around and don't nobody
[2:08:38] say, "Oh, well, glory to God." Somebody
[2:08:40] shout hallelujah. Them devils creep in
[2:08:43] and they dare you to say something. I
[2:08:45] dare you to say something. Well, you
[2:08:47] dared the wrong preacher this morning.
[2:08:48] I'm not scared of no devil. I'll say it
[2:08:50] if it her lips ever devil and his
[2:08:52] brother. This message will produce a
[2:08:55] clean church.
[2:08:58] And if you're not, you might as well
[2:09:00] take the message sign off the door and
[2:09:02] get rid of the books because this
[2:09:03] message is not going to be a charismatic
[2:09:06] reproduction of a bunch of loose living
[2:09:08] casual Christians. It's going to be a
[2:09:10] reproduction of the father himself with
[2:09:13] strength and authority.
[2:09:17] Oh, somebody say amen.
[2:09:19] Some of you fathers right now ought to
[2:09:21] say amen. Come on. I just give you a
[2:09:23] liberty by the word. Amen. To squash
[2:09:26] that devil in your home.
[2:09:30] I know I'm going over time, but I'm
[2:09:32] going to have to go cuz the Lord's
[2:09:33] leading me here. You know what we ought
[2:09:35] to do? We ought to salute our elders. We
[2:09:38] ought to salute our elders in the
[2:09:39] church. Amen. That have lived this word
[2:09:41] for 30 and 40. Sister Watkins, we salute
[2:09:43] you this morning. We salute you, our
[2:09:46] sister. Amen. Amen. Can I ask her to
[2:09:48] would you just stand up, sis? Would you
[2:09:50] mind? Amen. Amen. We salute this
[2:09:52] daughter of God.
[2:09:54] She's dressed like a Christian. She
[2:09:56] walks like a Christian. She talks like a
[2:09:58] Christian. Sister Watkins, we salute
[2:10:00] you. Thank you.
[2:10:03] You know what? Amen. You'll have a
[2:10:05] pillar in church like that. Amen. For 50
[2:10:07] years. And young girls, now can I take
[2:10:09] some liberty? Young girls will never one
[2:10:11] time go to her and say, "Sister Watkins,
[2:10:13] tell us about how you prayed through
[2:10:15] them lonely nights. Tell us how you got
[2:10:17] through them hard times. Tell us how you
[2:10:19] got down before God and he led you
[2:10:20] through all them valleys. Would you tell
[2:10:22] us how we want to be like you, sis? We
[2:10:24] we we see something on you." Amen. We
[2:10:27] see something on you. We want to be like
[2:10:28] you. Would you tell us the secret? Amen.
[2:10:31] They won't do that. But you let some
[2:10:32] 50-year-old woman come in church with
[2:10:34] high heel shoes on, a split halfway up
[2:10:37] her side, a low cut blouse, and every
[2:10:39] young girl in the church, amen, will
[2:10:41] begin to pattern like her. Amen. You
[2:10:43] know why? Because it's the influence of
[2:10:45] the age we're living in. But you know
[2:10:46] what I say? We ought to resist the
[2:10:48] influence of hell and embrace the
[2:10:50] influence from heaven. We ought to
[2:10:52] resist the influence of Hollywood and
[2:10:54] embrace the influence of the restoration
[2:10:57] of the modesty of the word of God in the
[2:11:00] age we're living in.
[2:11:03] I say bring back holiness. I come on.
[2:11:05] You want to hear something? Make
[2:11:07] holiness great again.
[2:11:10] Quit trying to make America great again.
[2:11:12] She's on her way to hell. She's doomed
[2:11:14] by prophecy. But there's a bride who's
[2:11:17] got a chance this morning. Amen. to step
[2:11:20] out of this earthbound Hollywood
[2:11:21] dimension and step over into the
[2:11:24] influence of the voice of God in this
[2:11:26] age.
[2:11:29] Raise up a standard and squash every
[2:11:32] devil that tries to tear it down.
[2:11:37] Now,
[2:11:39] I'll just say this. When you come under
[2:11:41] this pro prophetic influence, you know
[2:11:42] what it's going to do?
[2:11:45] It's going to give you the courage to
[2:11:46] prophesy again. Amen. Amen.
[2:11:50] Somebody say, "Preacher, you're
[2:11:50] offerable." You're exactly right. I've
[2:11:52] read a prophet.
[2:11:58] Well, come on, church.
[2:12:01] I'm going to close right here. Or at
[2:12:02] least try to.
[2:12:06] Brother Luther, open that door up and
[2:12:07] let that devil out of here.
[2:12:11] Stomp him and then let him out.
[2:12:17] We dismiss the devil. We dismiss his
[2:12:20] influence. We dismiss his ideas. We
[2:12:23] dismiss his formal casual lukewarm
[2:12:27] religious identity. And we embrace the
[2:12:30] restoration of the word gene seed
[2:12:32] identity that has been released in this
[2:12:34] age. We brother Aaron will not be out of
[2:12:37] sense. We will not be lukewarm. We will
[2:12:39] not be rich and miserable, poor, blind
[2:12:41] and naked. But we will be the bride of
[2:12:43] Jesus Christ who will take that open
[2:12:46] book under that third pull. And we will
[2:12:48] eat the book. Can I say this? And we'll
[2:12:52] prophesy again.
[2:12:56] We're going to eat the book, Josh. And
[2:12:58] we're going to prophesy again. We're
[2:13:00] going to eat the book, Brother Brad. And
[2:13:01] we're going to prophesy again. Brother
[2:13:03] Matt, we're going to eat the book,
[2:13:05] Brother JD. We're going to eat the book,
[2:13:07] Brother Jason. We're going to eat this
[2:13:08] book. And as we eat this book, it's
[2:13:10] going to put a prophetic anointing in
[2:13:12] our mouth.
[2:13:14] Glory to God. You say, "Preacher, what
[2:13:17] are you getting at?" I'll tell you what
[2:13:18] I'm getting at. I'm saying this.
[2:13:22] Under this message, he said this, "Thou
[2:13:24] must prophesy again." Somebody say,
[2:13:26] "Me."
[2:13:26] Me,
[2:13:27] must
[2:13:28] prophe
[2:13:32] must
[2:13:33] prophesy
[2:13:34] again. Amen.
[2:13:36] That word prophesy means to utter forth.
[2:13:39] Yeah. Oh God, I've run out of time.
[2:13:42] It means to declare a thing which can
[2:13:45] only be known by divine revelation.
[2:13:49] If you're going to prophesy, you can
[2:13:52] only do it by something that's been
[2:13:54] revealed through divine revelation.
[2:13:58] Can I say it to you like this? This
[2:14:00] message is not a gift of prophecy.
[2:14:06] You say, "Why do you say that?" Because
[2:14:07] the gift of prophecy, according to your
[2:14:09] prophet and mine, has to be judged by
[2:14:11] two or three witnesses before it's ever
[2:14:14] even given out to the people.
[2:14:16] Now, Brother Brad, amen. I'm just going
[2:14:17] to use this illustration heard one time.
[2:14:19] Pretty pretty pretty simple. I got up
[2:14:20] here and I said, "Yay, I say unto thee,
[2:14:22] Brother Brad, thou my servant, the Lord
[2:14:25] says unto me to tell thee, tomorrow at
[2:14:27] the noonday hour, don't go over to your
[2:14:29] truck door and put your hand in the
[2:14:31] truck door, for there will be a snake
[2:14:33] curled up in your truck door, and when
[2:14:35] you lay your hand on it, that snake will
[2:14:36] bite you. But if thou will heed my
[2:14:38] voice, I'm not making fun. I'm I'm
[2:14:40] placing some things here, so just relax.
[2:14:42] If thou is this okay, Brother Jason, if
[2:14:44] thou will heed my voice, then if a noon
[2:14:46] day, go not near that door." Brother
[2:14:48] Brad says, "Okay." Now, if we're going
[2:14:50] to follow the scripture, you're going to
[2:14:51] bring that prophecy before this church
[2:14:54] and you're going to judge it by two or
[2:14:55] three witnesses. And if brother Brad
[2:14:57] receives it and says, "Okay, tomorrow at
[2:15:00] the noonday hour, I'll not go to my
[2:15:01] truck door. I'll wait till the 1:00 hour
[2:15:04] and I'll go to my truck door and I'll
[2:15:06] put my hand there and I'll see there's
[2:15:07] been a snake there, but it's gone now."
[2:15:09] He'll call me up, say, "Brother Andrew,
[2:15:10] thank you. That's what happened. It's
[2:15:12] the truth." But at the noonday hour, if
[2:15:14] he goes to his truck door, and there's
[2:15:16] no snake there, if Brother Brad loves
[2:15:18] me, he'll call me up and say, "Brother
[2:15:20] Andrew, go call Brother Jason. Go kneel
[2:15:23] down at the altar. You got a lying
[2:15:25] spirit on you. Get that thing prayed off
[2:15:27] of you so you can go on and serve God."
[2:15:29] Come on. That's what a prophet of God
[2:15:30] said. He said, "Anything that says thus
[2:15:32] sayith the Lord, and the Lord has not
[2:15:34] said thus, that man is worthy of hell."
[2:15:37] Come on. Because he's lied in the name
[2:15:39] of God. Let me just go ahead and say
[2:15:41] this. This message is not a prophecy of
[2:15:44] ooh ah I feel I see I sense something in
[2:15:47] this room is not right
[2:15:49] God have mercy. Come on church this
[2:15:52] message is not ooh ah hey I oh my
[2:15:55] somebody somewhere in this room right
[2:15:57] now you've had a bad week. Somebody
[2:15:59] somewhere right now you ah you got to
[2:16:02] pay. Somebody in here you got a pain.
[2:16:03] That's not this message. This message is
[2:16:06] not a message to be judged by two or
[2:16:08] three witnesses. I close by saying this.
[2:16:10] This message is the judge.
[2:16:15] This message is the judge. You don't
[2:16:18] judge something. You don't judge this
[2:16:20] message by something. You judge
[2:16:22] something by this message. I understand
[2:16:24] by books. Somebody told me one time they
[2:16:27] said, "I want to prophesy." Anybody here
[2:16:29] want to prophesy? Anybody here want to
[2:16:31] prophesy? It's not a trick question.
[2:16:32] Anybody want to prophesy? You want to
[2:16:34] prophesy? Okay. I'm going to tell you
[2:16:36] how to prophesy. Oh my. This is going
[2:16:38] all over the internet, is it? I'm going
[2:16:40] to tell you how to prophesy. Okay? Go
[2:16:42] home, turn on a tape, listen to what a
[2:16:44] prophet said, and then go say it.
[2:16:49] Go listen to what a prophet said, and
[2:16:51] then go say it. You know why? Because
[2:16:53] you'll be prophesied. You say, "I will
[2:16:56] be." Yeah. And guess what? You won't
[2:16:57] have to be judged. And it won't have to
[2:16:59] be asked, "Is this okay?" You can say
[2:17:01] what a prophet said underneath his
[2:17:04] prophetic utterance and back every devil
[2:17:06] off of your property.
[2:17:10] God, I got to close, brother. I got to.
[2:17:12] But right here, I'm closing my Bible.
[2:17:14] Y'all are pulling my guts out. You're
[2:17:16] killing me, but I'm loving every minute
[2:17:18] of it. Are you hearing me? When you get
[2:17:21] under this third pull, prophetic
[2:17:23] utterance, you will say what's already
[2:17:25] been said.
[2:17:26] Come on, go read Look Away to Jesus. I
[2:17:28] never called this before, Brother Jason.
[2:17:30] In Look Away to Jesus, Brother Braden
[2:17:32] rehearses Hatty Rice conversation down
[2:17:34] there at Charlie Cox's. And Brother
[2:17:36] Brady says it like this. He says, "I
[2:17:38] said and then she said." He said, "I
[2:17:41] said and then she said and I said and
[2:17:44] she said." I said, "She said." And when
[2:17:46] I said, "Then she said." Come on. He
[2:17:49] gives you a dialogue of what was being
[2:17:50] said. And then I found out where he
[2:17:52] said. He said the room felt like it was
[2:17:55] coming apart. He said down there the
[2:17:58] room felt like it was coming apart.
[2:17:59] Josh, I've often wondered, you preachers
[2:18:01] know what I'm talking about. you'll be
[2:18:02] preaching this message. This third pull
[2:18:04] anointing and brother Brad, it feels
[2:18:06] like the room is getting ready to break
[2:18:08] loose. It feels like the room is getting
[2:18:09] ready to bust open. Then it dawned on
[2:18:11] me, this third pull anointing is a super
[2:18:14] anointing. It is an anointing that will
[2:18:17] break the cages of bars of bone and
[2:18:20] flesh.
[2:18:24] This a third pull anointing will release
[2:18:26] you. Come on, church. You know why this
[2:18:28] third pull has got to have the power to
[2:18:31] blow things apart? Because it's going to
[2:18:33] blow your flesh body apart and going to
[2:18:35] release your soul. Amen. To go meet the
[2:18:38] theophony and then it'll be word born
[2:18:41] theophony.
[2:18:44] You know what I say? I say we ought to
[2:18:46] stand up on our feet this morning and
[2:18:48] say thank God for the third pull. Thank
[2:18:50] God for this prophetic utterance. Thank
[2:18:53] God for this message that has broke out
[2:18:55] in this generation. Is there anybody
[2:18:57] here say I'll say what he said.
[2:19:00] I'll say what he said. If I don't
[2:19:02] understand it, I'll say it anyhow. I'll
[2:19:05] say what he said. Come on, musicians.
[2:19:08] Sister Sarah, it's powerful. He said, I
[2:19:11] said, she said, I said, she said, I
[2:19:15] said, she said. He prophesied. She
[2:19:18] prophesied. He spoke. Come on. And what
[2:19:21] she said, she didn't change one thing.
[2:19:23] He said,
[2:19:26] Amen.
[2:19:30] Brother Matt, what she said was the same
[2:19:32] thing he said because the spirit, the
[2:19:35] prophet, and the bride will all
[2:19:40] they'll all be saying the same thing.
[2:19:43] The spirit said
[2:19:46] I feel like dancing right now. The
[2:19:48] spirit said I'm still Jehovah Gyra. The
[2:19:51] prophet said he's still Jehovah Gyra.
[2:19:54] had right said it. That's nothing but
[2:19:56] the truth.
[2:19:58] Come on. She didn't change what he said.
[2:20:00] She just put her amen with what the
[2:20:03] spirit said and the prophet said. Come
[2:20:05] on, church. Can I tell you something? If
[2:20:07] you'll say what a prophet said, you'll
[2:20:09] see the results of saying what a prophet
[2:20:12] said.
[2:20:15] Amen.
[2:20:18] Come on. It's a third pull anointing.
[2:20:22] It's a creation by the word anointing.
[2:20:29] It is a creation by the spoken word
[2:20:32] anointing. Brother Jason, without
[2:20:35] anything,
[2:20:37] there comes something.
[2:20:40] Come on, you want to go with me? Let's
[2:20:41] go to the woods. Where was the squirrel
[2:20:43] guts? Where was the squirrel DNA? Where
[2:20:47] was the squirrel bones that Jesus come
[2:20:48] down, waved his hand over there in the
[2:20:50] woods and said, "Abracadabra, abracadoo,
[2:20:52] I wave my hand over you.
[2:20:55] Abracadabra, abracadoo. Out of the
[2:20:57] squirrel residue, I make a squirrel here
[2:20:59] for you."
[2:21:02] There was nothing laying there to work
[2:21:04] with.
[2:21:07] But when the word spoke, Sister Pay,
[2:21:10] when the word spoke, the word brought an
[2:21:13] anointing and created a squirrel. Amen.
[2:21:17] Can I tell you something? Hadty Wright's
[2:21:20] boys was in a cage of teenage rebellion.
[2:21:24] But when she said what a prophet said
[2:21:27] underneath prophetic utterance, that
[2:21:29] influence went over in the other room,
[2:21:32] got up on those boys
[2:21:36] and they become a result of saying what
[2:21:38] a prophet said. Listen,
[2:21:42] it's a room busting anointing. Amen.
[2:21:45] It's a cage breaking anointing. You say,
[2:21:47] "Preacher,
[2:21:48] why are you saying these things?" Cuz I
[2:21:50] say this, "Brother Jason, when the
[2:21:52] spirit of the Lord dealt with my heart
[2:21:53] at 1:42 a.m. Friday morning, spoke to my
[2:21:57] heart and said, "Preach these two
[2:21:58] messages. Preach my people the Jubilee
[2:22:01] and ordain to a message." I said, "Lord,
[2:22:04] that's not the order I had, but the Lord
[2:22:06] revealed this to my heart." When he
[2:22:09] preaches that jubilee, Reverend takes it
[2:22:12] Johnny Crow and says, "What about you're
[2:22:13] free?" But my church says, "What about
[2:22:15] you're free?" He said, "See, you're not
[2:22:17] bound anymore. You are free, but maybe
[2:22:21] you don't know it."
[2:22:24] I believe right here this morning, this
[2:22:26] third pull anointing has brought an
[2:22:28] understanding
[2:22:29] to hearts.
[2:22:32] Bible said he loosed us from our sins,
[2:22:33] our unbelief. Brother, brother brother,
[2:22:35] brother brother Josh, why did he lose
[2:22:37] us? Brother said that we might receive
[2:22:40] the revelation
[2:22:42] of Jesus Christ. This Jubilee trumpet is
[2:22:45] sounded so you could receive the full
[2:22:48] revelation of the full word revealed.
[2:22:52] Church, you was ordained to it.
[2:22:55] You was ordained to it.
[2:22:57] How many believes that this third pull
[2:22:59] is in the room right now?
[2:23:02] Even when I don't see it working, it's
[2:23:03] here. Brother Ethan.
[2:23:04] Hallelujah.
[2:23:06] Even when I don't feel it working, it's
[2:23:07] here.
[2:23:09] I'm going to testify for just a minute
[2:23:10] of the glory of God cuz I feel right
[2:23:12] here on my heart to tell it.
[2:23:14] Two years ago, 2021, 2022,
[2:23:17] I went out to brother Biscos and
[2:23:18] preached there winter youth camp there.
[2:23:20] And Wednesday night, we had a service in
[2:23:22] the church cuz some couldn't cross the
[2:23:23] border. And I was preaching along these
[2:23:25] lines on the third pool. And I was
[2:23:26] preaching. I said, "Now the Lord is in
[2:23:28] this building." And I said, "The same
[2:23:29] God that could not create squirrels
[2:23:32] or the same God that created squirrels
[2:23:35] that didn't have anything there to
[2:23:36] create him from, just a spoken word, is
[2:23:38] in this room." I said, "There don't even
[2:23:40] have to be anything there, but God can
[2:23:42] make something happen."
[2:23:44] When I said that, I did not know that
[2:23:46] there was Brother Murphy, you all
[2:23:48] probably know Brother Murphy Wong.
[2:23:49] Brother Murphy, his daughter was sitting
[2:23:50] there and she had just gotten married a
[2:23:53] few years before that and they were
[2:23:54] trying to have a child. And if they
[2:23:56] can't, brother Murphy tells me, Brother
[2:23:58] Andrew said, "This is my daughter." He
[2:23:59] said, "They've been trying to have a
[2:24:00] child for several years." He said, "It's
[2:24:02] not worked out." He said, "God's God's
[2:24:04] God's going to give us that baby. He's
[2:24:05] going to give us a grandbaby."
[2:24:08] So this year, I go back, Brother Murphy
[2:24:10] comes up to me. He said, "Brother
[2:24:11] Andrew," he says, "Uh, my daughter had
[2:24:13] that grandbaby." I said, "Really?" I
[2:24:15] said, "Well, I I want to see that baby."
[2:24:17] Her husband brings the baby over at the
[2:24:19] camp. She said, "Now, brother Andrew,
[2:24:21] can I share the testimony with you?" I
[2:24:22] said, "Sure, sis." She said, "Listen."
[2:24:24] She said, "Two years ago, before the
[2:24:25] winter youth camp last year," she said,
[2:24:27] "Brother Ron Spencer was here, and while
[2:24:29] he was praying for me, he had a vision
[2:24:30] of me holding a baby, having a child."
[2:24:32] She said, "I took that into my heart and
[2:24:34] said, I'll have this child." She said,
[2:24:35] "I went to the doctor. The doctor said,
[2:24:37] now we can we can do a surgery that'll
[2:24:39] cause you to have a child, but unless we
[2:24:41] do the surgery, you'll never have the
[2:24:42] child." She said, "My heart sunk." She
[2:24:44] said, "I had the vision." She said, "So
[2:24:47] now," I said, "Brother brother," she
[2:24:49] told her husband, she said, "I'm just
[2:24:50] going to believe Brother Ron's vision.
[2:24:51] I'm going to believe the word." She
[2:24:52] said, "We're going to have that surgery.
[2:24:53] I'm going to have that baby." She said,
[2:24:55] "But on that Wednesday night," she said,
[2:24:56] "we hadn't had the surgery yet." She
[2:24:59] said, "While you were speaking," she
[2:25:01] said, "there was actually something in
[2:25:02] my body that was missing that the
[2:25:04] surgery was going to fix to give me a
[2:25:06] child." She said, "But while that word
[2:25:08] was going forth," she said, "the Lord
[2:25:10] dropped in my heart and said, I can
[2:25:12] create it right now." She said, "Brother
[2:25:14] Andrew, I received it." She said, "I got
[2:25:16] in the car." She said, "I went home
[2:25:18] believing I was going to have that
[2:25:19] child." She said, "And the next
[2:25:21] morning," she said, "The reason I come
[2:25:23] to camp so happy last year is the next
[2:25:25] morning, not telling nobody, I got up,
[2:25:28] took a pregnancy test, it was positive.
[2:25:30] I took another one, it was positive."
[2:25:32] She said, "I took another one, it was
[2:25:33] pos." She said, "And here is the baby."
[2:25:36] What are you saying, friends? I never
[2:25:38] laid my hand on her.
[2:25:40] The word,
[2:25:42] this message is working.
[2:25:45] You love him here today, friends. I
[2:25:47] thank you for your time this morning. I
[2:25:49] pray something has been said to bless
[2:25:51] you.
[2:25:52] I pray something has been said to
[2:25:53] challenge you.
[2:25:54] Put your running shoes on.
[2:25:56] Run with this message. Run with it. Say
[2:26:00] what a prophet said and prophesy again.
[2:26:03] We love you though, Lord. God bless you,
[2:26:04] brother Jason. Would you come?
[2:26:06] [Applause]
[2:26:18] Wow.
[2:26:20] Everybody say, "Wow."
[2:26:21] Wow.
[2:26:22] Now say it backwards.
[2:26:23] Wow.
[2:26:26] It's still wow.
[2:26:28] Yeah.
[2:26:30] You know, I was um I was standing there
[2:26:34] and I was um thinking of something I
[2:26:37] wanted to say and I thought, man, I
[2:26:38] can't wait to get that microphone.
[2:26:41] Go ahead, brother. And a brother in here
[2:26:44] that's here right now sent me a message
[2:26:46] and he said if you come now I'm let me
[2:26:50] usually you hear these political things
[2:26:52] and then the politician will come behind
[2:26:53] it and say hi my name is and I I endorse
[2:26:56] this message. I want to say it first. My
[2:26:58] name is Pastor Jason Watkins and I
[2:27:00] endorse this message
[2:27:02] what you just heard
[2:27:04] and what you're about to hear. He said,
[2:27:06] "If you come to Bethl Tabernacle,
[2:27:09] you heard in capital letters what we
[2:27:13] believe." That's right.
[2:27:14] Amen.
[2:27:14] Beth Tabernacle. Is that true?
[2:27:17] You heard what we believe. If you don't
[2:27:19] believe what was preached today, you're
[2:27:21] at the wrong church. If there ever was a
[2:27:24] statement of faith for this church, we
[2:27:26] heard it today.
[2:27:28] I'm fond of saying amens a thousand. I'm
[2:27:30] known for it. I just said, "Amen times a
[2:27:32] million." I had to put a bunch more
[2:27:34] zeros into that. I tell you something,
[2:27:36] friends. I was standing here thinking to
[2:27:37] myself, I'm so glad, brother Andrew,
[2:27:39] when I first took this church in 1995,
[2:27:42] 28, n whatever years ago that is. And
[2:27:45] one of my one of my very first
[2:27:47] statements when the little O-frame
[2:27:49] that's not even standing anymore, I
[2:27:51] said, "You need to understand that I
[2:27:54] preach I stand squarely on the Bible as
[2:27:58] taught to me by God's prophet, William
[2:28:01] Brren." Amen.
[2:28:02] And if you don't believe that, you've
[2:28:03] got the wrong man for the job.
[2:28:06] And for 28 years, I have stood on that.
[2:28:09] Hallelujah.
[2:28:10] I believe that, friends.
[2:28:12] 1:42 in the morning on Friday.
[2:28:15] Friday morning.
[2:28:15] You know why that happened? Cuz a dozen
[2:28:18] men were in here Thursday night on their
[2:28:20] knees
[2:28:21] praying, "God, speak to your servant."
[2:28:25] The last thing we did is we left the
[2:28:26] building. God, speak to your servant.
[2:28:28] move on him for the words that we need
[2:28:30] to come this weekend.
[2:28:32] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. I'm
[2:28:35] here to tell you, he's an ontime God.
[2:28:39] Hallelujah.
[2:28:40] Wow. What kind of anointing you leave
[2:28:42] standing here, brother?
[2:28:44] Sing, brother Kenny.
[2:28:45] Hallelujah.
[2:28:48] [Music]
[2:28:59] I worship you.
[2:29:02] Come on and sing it, friends.
[2:29:04] I worship you.
[2:29:08] You are here.
[2:29:10] Lift it up.
[2:29:12] Working in this.
[2:29:14] Oh, now here's the time for the
[2:29:16] supernatural.
[2:29:17] I worship you.
[2:29:19] You ready to see God go to work?
[2:29:21] Hallelujah.
[2:29:23] Now you've heard the word. Now it's time
[2:29:25] to worship.
[2:29:28] Oh, let him come and water this in this
[2:29:32] place.
[2:29:33] Oh, we worship you, Lord.
[2:29:34] I worship you.
[2:29:37] [Music]
[2:29:39] I worship you.
[2:29:40] Yes, God.
[2:29:42] You're here.
[2:29:43] You are here.
[2:29:47] Working in this place.
[2:29:51] We worship you.
[2:29:52] I worship you.
[2:29:54] Oh, he's worthy of it, friends. I
[2:29:57] worship you.
[2:30:00] Oh, you are way maker, miracle worker,
[2:30:06] promise keeper, light in the darkness.
[2:30:11] My God, that is who you are.
[2:30:17] Oh, you're the way maker, miracle
[2:30:23] worker, promise keeper, light in the
[2:30:27] darkness.
[2:30:29] My God, that is who you are.
[2:30:35] You are here
[2:30:39] touching every
[2:30:41] heart.
[2:30:44] I worship you.
[2:30:48] Oh, I worship you.
[2:30:52] You are here.
[2:30:56] You're healing every
[2:30:58] heart.
[2:31:00] Lord, I worship you.
[2:31:05] Oh, I worship
[2:31:07] you.
[2:31:09] Glory. You're the way maker, miracle
[2:31:14] worker, promise keeper, light in the
[2:31:18] darkness.
[2:31:20] My God, that is who you are.
[2:31:26] Oh, you're the way maker, miracle

[2:36:10] That is who you are.
[2:36:13] We receive it, oh God. Hallelujah, Lord
[2:36:16] Jesus. Oh, we worship you today, oh God.
[2:36:21] Worthy is the lamb of God.
[2:36:23] Thank you for this great outpouring of
[2:36:25] your word and your spirit today. Lord,
[2:36:28] thank you for the faith that we have
[2:36:30] seen made manifest in our midst.
[2:36:33] Thank you for believers.
[2:36:35] Thank you for people who have courage to
[2:36:37] take the word and say, "Me, count me
[2:36:39] in."
[2:36:40] Yes, sir.
[2:36:41] Thank you for Christ. Thank you for that
[2:36:43] day on Calvary. Lord,
[2:36:45] we worship you today in spirit and
[2:36:48] truth.
[2:36:52] If I said to you today,
[2:36:57] we're not here to carry on the
[2:36:59] traditions of the Pentecostal message.
[2:37:04] We're not here to carry those traditions
[2:37:05] on.
[2:37:06] We we we carry all of the word that was
[2:37:10] delivered to every age, but all the
[2:37:12] man-made stuff, we're done with that.
[2:37:16] Brother Brandham said, "The church has
[2:37:19] become its own voice
[2:37:21] to put Christ out. This is the age of
[2:37:24] the word and the word only." Meaning no
[2:37:29] no mongalizing,
[2:37:32] no additions, no subtractions, the full
[2:37:35] word of God. That's what we desire.
[2:37:39] Amen.
[2:37:40] Amen. If I said to you today,
[2:37:44] we are ordained to the message,
[2:37:48] would you believe it?
[2:37:50] You were shouting amen to it about an
[2:37:52] hour ago.
[2:37:52] Amen.
[2:37:54] All right. Now you you you you're
[2:37:56] strapped in.
[2:37:58] All right. You've already said amen
[2:37:59] twice.
[2:38:00] Yeah.
[2:38:01] Thus, we are responsible to this
[2:38:04] message.
[2:38:06] Now, we would have a bigger amen.
[2:38:08] Amen.
[2:38:11] If I said to you,
[2:38:13] we are not ordained to live outside of
[2:38:17] his presence.
[2:38:19] Amen.
[2:38:20] You say amen again to that.
[2:38:21] Amen.
[2:38:23] We have been ordained to live inside.
[2:38:26] [Music]
[2:38:28] You know that's why a prophet comes.
[2:38:30] That's the purpose of a prophet. A
[2:38:32] prophet conducts you into his presence.
[2:38:36] Benny Hinn. You go to Benny Hinn, he can
[2:38:39] conduct you into the anointing.
[2:38:42] Absolutely. That because the rain falls
[2:38:43] on the just and the unjust. Brother
[2:38:45] Brian preached a whole sermon, false
[2:38:47] anointed ones.
[2:38:48] And he didn't say it was a false
[2:38:49] anointing. He says a false vessel with a
[2:38:51] true anointing. That's what set the
[2:38:53] theological world on end. They're like,
[2:38:55] "What are you kidding?" Yes. It was
[2:38:56] right in the scripture.
[2:38:57] Balam under a true anointing, but yet a
[2:39:00] false prophet.
[2:39:01] Yeah.
[2:39:02] See, you can be a real prophet, but not
[2:39:03] be a true one.
[2:39:05] Balam was a real genuine one, but he was
[2:39:07] a false one because he preached false
[2:39:08] doctrine.
[2:39:10] See,
[2:39:11] and but a prophet is not is not just to
[2:39:14] take you into the blessing. You can pay
[2:39:16] your tithes and offerings and get a
[2:39:17] blessing. You don't have to be a
[2:39:18] Christian.
[2:39:20] That that's universal law,
[2:39:21] right?
[2:39:22] You can go into any kind of Pentecostal
[2:39:25] church or even even I wouldn't I
[2:39:28] wouldn't exclude any and say you can get
[2:39:29] a real anointing, but if you want to go
[2:39:31] into his presence, that requires a
[2:39:33] prophet.
[2:39:34] God sent a prophet to conduct you into
[2:39:37] the presence
[2:39:39] of the Lord.
[2:39:40] Amen.
[2:39:43] If I said, would you believe if I said
[2:39:46] we are sent here for a purpose of God
[2:39:49] with a very specific purpose to fulfill?
[2:39:55] Amen.
[2:39:56] That that you say, what is that specific
[2:39:58] purpose? The very specific word that God
[2:40:00] said this bride would fulfill in the
[2:40:02] last days. One of them we've been
[2:40:04] talking about a lot is comes from
[2:40:05] Daniel. The people of the end time who
[2:40:07] know their God will do great exploits.
[2:40:09] Hallelujah.
[2:40:12] Would you believe me if I said when you
[2:40:14] recognize his purpose oh I mean his
[2:40:16] presence. I love this. I about went
[2:40:17] through the roof. When you recognize his
[2:40:20] presence, Brother Ram said the that the
[2:40:22] reason people don't reverence God
[2:40:25] because they don't recognize his
[2:40:26] presence.
[2:40:27] Amen.
[2:40:29] That's right. That's why people will
[2:40:30] come right into a message church. Girls
[2:40:33] will come in, men will come in dressed
[2:40:35] wrong, acting wrong, looking wrong,
[2:40:38] because they've never caught that
[2:40:40] revelation of his divine presence.
[2:40:42] Amen.
[2:40:43] See, that's why we we try our best to
[2:40:45] bring the presence of God to you by the
[2:40:47] opening of the word. So, don't let it
[2:40:49] make you mad. Let it make you glad.
[2:40:51] Hallelujah.
[2:40:53] When when when you recognize his
[2:40:55] presence, you release the ordained
[2:41:00] power, hallelujah, from the word
[2:41:04] that's meant to flow from God through
[2:41:06] you to a dark world.
[2:41:08] How many believers we got of that today?
[2:41:12] To bring light to a dark world. Listen,
[2:41:16] I love this. Listen about put me on the
[2:41:18] ground. God don't need your abilities.
[2:41:22] And I just wrote in there, my God don't
[2:41:24] need my abilities. He only needs your my
[2:41:28] surrender.
[2:41:31] That's right.
[2:41:32] He only needs your surrender.
[2:41:36] We've been called
[2:41:39] in the realm of the soul for a divine
[2:41:42] purpose by a divine call. No wonder I
[2:41:47] believe it. No wonder.
[2:41:51] Can I use my favorite double negative?
[2:41:53] No wonder I can't not believe it.
[2:41:57] Cuz I've been called from the soul. And
[2:41:59] no matter what this outer man wants to
[2:42:01] think, do, or say, there's there's
[2:42:03] another version of me down on the
[2:42:05] inside.
[2:42:07] Oh, as brother JD was saying today, that
[2:42:09] thing permeates all through your flesh.
[2:42:11] Brother Jason, I about went crazy when
[2:42:13] you said that. Permeates. I just say,
[2:42:15] let it permeate.
[2:42:16] Let it saturate. Take over my mind. take
[2:42:19] over everything about my life. Come on,
[2:42:21] friends. Is that your desire?
[2:42:23] That's why we've come to church this
[2:42:25] weekend.
[2:42:26] The force, would you believe me if I
[2:42:30] were to say to you today, the force of
[2:42:33] prophecy in the word is making us into a
[2:42:37] prophetic class of people.
[2:42:40] I didn't say it's just inviting you to
[2:42:42] be.
[2:42:44] It's making.
[2:42:45] Amen.
[2:42:46] I'll sprinkle clean water upon you. I'll
[2:42:49] put a new spirit on you. But then I'll
[2:42:50] pour my spirit in you and I will cause
[2:42:53] you to keep my word.
[2:42:56] Oh, I think the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:42:59] deserves an applause.
[2:43:02] Lord, we love you,
[2:43:06] Lord Jesus.
[2:43:08] Thank you, Lord,
[2:43:10] for your great and glorious word today.
[2:43:19] Amen. This microphone got a workout last
[2:43:21] couple days. I didn't think brother
[2:43:23] Andrew could sweat more than he did last
[2:43:24] night. I was wrong.
[2:43:28] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:43:29] We're going to going to let you go.
[2:43:31] We've got a afternoon of fellowship
[2:43:33] planned and you know there um is that
[2:43:37] upper room going to start right away or
[2:43:39] is that going to be later in the
[2:43:40] afternoon or six? Okay. So, we've got
[2:43:42] our regular regularly scheduled
[2:43:44] fellowship. Amen. Come come fellowship

[2:44:10] this many. Amen. But the house will, but
[2:44:12] you might be downstairs singing while
[2:44:14] we're upstairs singing. And we're going
[2:44:16] to have a little fellowship in Jubilee.
[2:44:19] It'll give you a chance to shake Brother
[2:44:21] Andrew's hand and Sister Mariah and
[2:44:25] Sister Loretta and Brother Josh and meet
[2:44:27] these little bundles of joy that they
[2:44:29] have. Amen. God bless you. Turn around
[2:44:32] and greet one another with a handshake.
