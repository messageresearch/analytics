TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Praise the Lord, saints. Happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Could we stand and let's just have a word of prayer. Just going to read the book of Psalms 124 if you want to find it. We serve a wonderful God. Amen. Don't you love the Lord? All the wonderful things that he does for us, how he takes care of us. Let's just bow our heads and have a word of prayer. Almighty God, it's always a privilege and an honor. Lord, we thank you, Lord, for this night tonight. Lord, we just thank you for your great words of salvation and light and hope, Lord, and your wonderfulness and your goodness and your grace and your mercy, Lord. I just pray, Father, from the depths of our soul that you would help us tonight to worship you in spirit and in truth. Lord, Father, we thank you for your great and mighty works that you do in each one of us, Lord. We just pray that you'd bless us tonight and just help us now. We thank you for everything. Just pray now in the name of Jesus Christ that you'd bless this service. Amen. And amen. And in the book of Psalms 124, it says, "If it had not been for the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel say, "If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us, then they had swallowed us up quick. When their wrath was kindled against us, then the waters had overwhelmed us. The stream had gone over our soul. Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. But blessed be the Lord who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. Aren't you glad for that? Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers. The snare is broken and we are escaped. Our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth. Amen. Let's just worship him tonight. Thank you, dear God. When we look into your holyness, when we gaze into your loveliness, when all things that surround become shadows in the light of you.

So, we're supposed to be examples to other people when we get stepped on and pushed around. supposed to emanate an aroma that people look at and want and desire. Amen. I don't know if you have the words to that or not, but let's just sing this together. Lily of the valley, let your sweet aroma fill my life. Rose of Sharon, show me how to grow in beauty in God.

So we can say that factually that is an actual truth statement. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. Amen. Let's just sing it from the depths of our heart bring his presence down. will surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. I can feel his mighty power and his grace.

I can feel his mighty power and his grace. &gt;&gt; I can feel the rush of angels wings. I see gloryy on each face. &gt;&gt; Surely the presence of the Lord is in this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, we're so grateful for that presence that we feel. We ask now, God, that you would come and be pleased with our worship, Lord, with the music, the singing, Lord, the preaching of your word. We're just, Lord, humbled to be, Father, in a place like this where the rest of the world, Lord, we could be a million different places with the dying, sick, lost, Lord. But here we are. We've been found. We've been called. We've been chosen, Lord. And we've got a desire in our heart to worship you, to bring Lord, a sweet sacrifice, Lord, a incense, Lord God, of praise that would be pleasing to you. I pray, God, that you would come and speak to us by your word. take everything under your control now. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You love the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't God good? God bless you. Amen. So good to be here in the house of the Lord. Amen. Tonight, thank you, brother Brad, and all the musicians for all that wonderful music. You appreciate good music, good singing. Amen. I I sure do. Thank you for yielding yourselves. Amen. If you have your Bible, we'll turn to the book of Acts, chapter 2. Just while you're standing, we'll have you read a portion of scripture. Then I'll have you be seated. Acts chapter 2. Amen. I'd like to just begin tonight and uh Lord willing, we'll carry this uh over in coming services. just a um a burden the Lord has just had upon my heart and I just would uh just would maybe tonight would just be a foundation just to begin and then Lord willing we can develop upon that and just see what the Lord has amen for us. I would like to just title this the real thing. That's my title tonight. The real thing. Amen. Acts chapter 2 and we'll just begin reading the 38th verse. Then Peter said unto them,"Repent and be baptized, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, for the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, "Save yourselves from this untored generation." Notice here in verse 41, then they that gladly received his word were baptized. Aren't you glad that something in your heart could receive his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. They that were gladly received were baptized in the same day that were added unto them about 3,000 souls. Amen. I just would uh have you maybe turn to the book of Galatians chapter 3. We'll just read one more scripture before you have you be seated. Amen. Let's just read a few portions. I may get to Galatians 3. I may not tonight depending on time. Brother Brad, when you go to the back, if you could grab my phone. I left it there on the back. Thank you. Oh, foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you. This only what I learn of you. received you the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith. &gt;&gt; Notice verse three. Are you so foolish having begun in the spirit? Are you now made perfect by the flesh? &gt;&gt; Have you suffered so many things in vain, if it be yet in vain? &gt;&gt; Notice verse five. We'll just read these two verses and I'll have you be seated. He therefore that ministerth to you the spirit and workketh miracles among you doth he by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith. Even as Abram believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Lord we just bow our heads together now Lord as one family Lord just your children seed of Abraham Lord we believe that by faith you've passed that promise down to us Lord God. And I pray that you would just come, Lord, make yourself real and alive by your word. I pray, God, that you would help me to deliver this burden that you've placed upon my heart. I pray, God, that you would allow me to communicate it, Lord, in such a way, Lord, that someone could see you more clearly. I pray that you would come and be with us now, one and all. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can be seated. God bless you, brother Doug. So good to have you. Amen. Here with us. Good to see you. Amen. I'd like to just begin here and I'm ministering to you, brother Brad. I do have my phone if he hears that. I just had it out of my eyesight there. So, I'm just trying to um Amen. make sure I have that. Good. Amen. Amen. I want to preach to you on the real thing. Now, we know that brother Brandham when he would speak about the Holy Ghost and he takes many different topics, I'm sorry, many different sermons on this and I there there's so many such a a wide uh subject here and so many things that we could say. Um, but I just want to just maybe key in on just a few things and uh and then we'll see where the Lord has it and where the Lord sort of takes us from here. I want to show you something because brother Brandham over and over uh would speak about these three works of grace that happens in the believer's life. Justification and sanctification and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the prophet makes such a statement here and there's a man that can turn on the light in 1963 in December. He said justification served its time in justification under Luther. Then it had to become sanctification through Wesley and sanctification served its time till it become the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And the baptism of the Holy Ghost served its time until the Holy Spirit blends into the church and the church into Christ and it makes Jesus Christ reflected on the earth what he promised here in the Bible might not believe it. I can't make you do that. I'm only responsible for the word. So he says justification served its time and then sanctification had to come and then that served its time and he says till it become the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So we've told on this many times here before that we know that brother Brandham wasn't saying that the age of the Holy Ghost would stop to the believer that we would somehow stop receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But brother Brandham was going to show us that in the restoration of the word, there would come a stage uh that would be called the restoration of the gifts back to the church. And he types this with what he's calling the baptism of the Holy Ghost or what we would say a baptism that is upon our flesh and our flesh only. What we understand is that a baptism on the flesh is a wonderful thing, &gt;&gt; but it's not enough. it doesn't get you in the rapture. And friends, that's really all that I'm interested in. &gt;&gt; And so, a work of the Holy Ghost is a wonderful thing. It's wonderful that God works in your life, but there's got to be something more than just a gift of the Holy Ghost. But, as we heard on Sunday, the giver of the gift must indwell your life. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And so, we know this because there's two types. There's actually two baptisms that is actually important for us to receive. One of water and one of spirit. So we live in a western world today in our economy and our politics and our education system. Many times we suffer from a very western view uh or a western understanding through perception and education because our western world is based upon Greek philosophy. You can this is uh permeates our entire culture. It it permeates our our education system and it's not based upon and the reason why that's important and important distinction is because the Bible is not written from a Greek mentality but it's written from a Hebrew mind. And so to understand what God was communicating through the Bible, you can't approach it from your western way of thinking. You've got to go into the Hebrew mind to know what the Bible meant was how it was written to the intent that it was not an education based I'm sorry not a a word based upon Greek philosophy but on Hebrew thinking and oh how different Hebrew thinking is than Greek thinking is it might be hard for you to understand say brother Matt I don't see how that really affects us but the difference between the two is that the Greeks could never tie the natural into the spiritual. So to the Greek, they're two different way, two different things that have no connection to each other. They're always separate. You have the world, the ma or you would call it today, they call it the maverse, the a supernatural unseen realm. And a Greek mind would believe in that unseen realm. But then they believed in a physical realm or a physical dimension, but that there was never any contact between the two dimensions or any connection. So in other words, nothing that you could do naturally could ever affect anything heavenly or vice versa, nothing that could happen in heaven could have any effect on earth. But they're two different spheres and two different circles. And this was a way that that the the the the the mind of the idoltor was that that God had was just a distant god that he wasn't acquainted with natural people or natural ways or natural life. But what we understand that brother Brandham taught us is that the natural actually types the spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many have heard brother Brandham say that nature runs in continuity? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, brother Brandon would always point to the natural things or things natural as they were a type of something that was taking place in the spiritual. We know this. This is all throughout the message. I don't have to teach on that here tonight. We know brother Brandon preaches countdown four or five times. And in all of those sermons, Brother Brandon makes it so clear that what you see in the natural is only a a evidence, an echo, if you would, of what God was doing in the supernatural. How many members that that he takes the horse and buggy and the discovery of the horse and buggy and he says it was man learning transportation. They move from the horse and buggy to the automobile and then they move from there to the jet aircraft to the astronaut age. And brother Brandon would type that and show that all the way all down throughout history. Science has always just been reflecting what God is doing. So in other words, what you see happening in earth is only because something has taken place in heaven. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hello. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so what we see going on even in our world today and technology and I'll just say this just uh here I believe that we're even in man has always been in a state of metamorphosis and whether he realized it that the the the it's always a changing ever evolving world. Technology is evolving. Sin is increasing. Sin is maturing. It's what the scripture teaches us that sin is always Satan's Eden is becoming more polished. It's becoming more mature. And so Satan isn't just static and he's just waiting somewhere, you know, back and and and going by the same playbook he did a 100 years ago. No, but actually his Eden would get to such a place to where it would be a a perfection. It would come to its its maturity. And so the tactic that the devil is using today though we can identify it by a spirit that's ancient but his tactic and the way that that's why technology today is moving in the pace that it is. &gt;&gt; Remember brother Brandham said this I think this is so profound. I'm just I shared this actually with a brother here recently and I he was sent me just a a video and it was very a great blessing to me of the how the artificial intelligence had created uh the Bible and it and asked it to create the Bible in 5 minutes and it was a pretty powerful video and I and it just struck me when I seen some of the uh some of the way that technology is moving and the way that things are happening at such a rapid pace and I I just I was just writing the brother back and told him that I believe things are moving faster. And and let me just say this, it's going to continue to speed up. &gt;&gt; And and I just I asked myself because he sent me this near Christmas Eve and we're just sitting there, you know, in all of this video of this. Everything that I'm seeing is artificial intelligence. It's, you know, these people that you're seeing look like real actors and real humans and they have the same features and you'd never know the difference that they were that it wasn't real. and he was he was just commenting on can you believe this is this is what our our world has you know has come to to where you can't tell what's fake and what's real and and and a video that looks so real yet it's created by a prompt uh on a computer and then a computer generates that what you've said and I and I just said to him I said it's amazing and I just asked the question I wonder what we will be watching or what will we what we will be in awe of come 2026 December December Christmas of this year. &gt;&gt; It's unpredictable. And so, Brother Brandham says this in the in the seven church ages. He says this in the legacy and church age. And I I don't have any of these up here. You can take that down for now. Uh and just keep that blank. The prophet of God says, "Now the age in which we are living, notice, is going to be a very short one. &gt;&gt; Events are going to transpire very rapidly." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So events, things that we live in is going to be a very short one. Events are going to transpire very rapidly. And we see that here today that technology has reached a place to where it's moving at such a rapid pace, you almost can't keep up. I mean, you're in the stone ages with by the end of the year, your phone is outdated and and uncapable and and you know, not just your phone, but any part of technology. Listen what he says here in the same message. He says, "How strange in this age of plenty, in this age of progress, in this age of abundance, how can there be trials?" Well, now it's strange, but in this age of plenty, opportunity, when everyone has so much and there is so much more to be had with what all the inventions to do our work, I don't know that brother Brandham even knew. I believe his words being prophetic, uh, we see the really what that really means. Now today artificial intelligence is replacing our work. &gt;&gt; Modern inventions to do our work for us. &gt;&gt; And he says with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure, suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, if it's so modern and so so advanced &gt;&gt; and everything's so easy, why would anybody be unhappy? This is what brother Adam's saying here, and this is in the 60s. And he says, "Suddenly, we find mental illness when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about. Millions are taking sedatives at night, pet pills in the morning, rushing to doctors, entering institutions, trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol. &gt;&gt; Yet this age boasts of its tremendous stores of worldly goods. But the people are less happy than ever. &gt;&gt; This age boasts of its spiritual attainment. Spiritual attainment. And he says, "But the people are less sure of themselves than ever. This age boasts of moral values, but it's more corrupt than any age since the flood." It talks about knowledge and science, but it's fighting a losing battle in all fields. Notice, for the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep a breast with all the changes that have come upon the earth. &gt;&gt; In one generation, notice just in one, in one generation, we have gone all the way from the horse and buggy age to the space age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are proud and boastful about it. But inside is a dark void cavern &gt;&gt; that is crying out in torment. &gt;&gt; And without notice a known reason, men's hearts are felling for fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the world, brother Brandham says, is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of neurotics. &gt;&gt; It boasts, but it cannot back it up. It cries peace and there is no peace. &gt;&gt; It cries that it has a great multitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because the Bible says there is no peace to the wicked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And everything that they have in this perfect Eden is just a very thin facade. And and so this is the age that that we live in that it's it's a we we're we're this this is a world that has moved very fast. Education is I'm sorry uh uh intelligence has moved to a place to where we have artificial intelligence and we don't know what's real anymore. We we we you don't know what a picture you could define what is even a picture anymore. What is a photo? It used to be, you know, a negative and a positive and taken with light in a lens. Now it's, you know, you could be looking at something and react to something and it's not even real. It was made digitally. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT NOTHING ABOUT IT. Though it looks real though, though it would, you know, it has all the same features. They could fake the lighting that you could tell AI to put, you know, this person and and take the 8K with studio lighting and the light coming from here. And man, you look at that picture and think, "Oh man, that's a REAL PHOTO." YOU KNOW, TAKE A PERSON to say, "Take this photo of this person. Remove all the pimples and remove all the wrinkles and remove all the gray hairs and the yellow in his teeth, make it white, and suck up his belly a little bit to get rid of that triple chin, you know, make him look really nice." And man, just in a moment, you have a photo AND YOU THINK, "WOW, THAT'S SUCH A WOW." AND YOU SEND THAT TO SOMEBODY. No one would know the difference that they not seen you. But I'm going to TELL YOU WHAT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT THE REAL THING. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to TELL YOU WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS generation is fake Christians who go to church, sing the songs, get up, sing specials, doesn't matter. Listen, friends, I don't care how much, how gifted you are, if you're a preacher, if you're a song leader, if you're just a PEW WARMER, UNLESS YOU'VE GOT THE REAL THING LIVING DOWN ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. I JUST WANT TO SAY, GOD, I IN 2026, I WANT THE REAL THING, LORD. I want it FOR MY FAMILY, LORD. I WANT IT FOR THIS CHURCH. I WANT TO BE GENUINE PEOPLE, NOT A NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS MAN-MADE, SOMETHING THAT IS GOD MADE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And so the the world WOULD THE NATURAL, AS brother Random said, would tight the spiritual. How many members, brother Adam saying, that all nature runs in continuity. And so what what we find is against the Greek and the Hebrew mind is that the Hebrews knew that actually the two worlds were only separated by time or we could say speed &gt;&gt; because that dimension is just moving a little bit faster than this dimension. &gt;&gt; And brother BRANDHAM WOULD SAY IT SO MUCH THAT WHEN you die, you don't go off a million miles. And he SAYS DEATH changes nothing except your dwelling place. &gt;&gt; And he says and what you are there is what you were here &gt;&gt; and he says the character that's what he says there &gt;&gt; and he says all that you have to take WITH YOU. SO WE NOTICE IT IN THAT other dimension that other dimension is just one step just right across the chaos. That's what brother I'm going to say. Brother man, I'm going to say just on the other side of the la of your last breath, just on the other side of this thin veil &gt;&gt; is a real world with real people and real life and real atmosphere &gt;&gt; and a real God. &gt;&gt; And so the Hebrews could understand that our God who is supernatural is spirit. He was the one who made the physical world, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so if God created time, then God must be outside of time. How could he not be? If the creator made time and matter, then he exists outside of time and matter, right? But we being creatures of time that have been called into this little hickey, as brother Brandham calls it, this little space of time, this little aotment of time that seems like uh, you know, our entire life because that's how we view it. It's our entire existence. &gt;&gt; BUT TO GOD, IT'S JUST A LITTLE SPECK, just a little dot on the map. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so so brother Brandham said it would the natural and the physical would run very closely together. So that western thinking affects us to think that the physical a physical event can't have any kind of spiritual effect. That's why people have trouble fitting water baptism into salvation &gt;&gt; because they can't see how a physical event can have a spiritual effect. Not saying it will, but it can. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I know that it's just to obedience, but you know, you have to be careful because you don't want to you could teach baptism in such a way that we would almost teach that as long as you've been under people could almost think that as long as they get baptized, I go under water, then that's it. &gt;&gt; But as as we've said many times, you can go down a dry center, come up a wet center, and there's no change in your life. &gt;&gt; Right? But in in the same way, you don't want to just dumb it down to baptism means nothing &gt;&gt; and that it doesn't have any effect. Well, that's not true. The Bible is full of the correlation between the physical and the spiritual. Let me give you just a few. Whatsoever you bind on earth, it shall be bound in heaven. &gt;&gt; Natural, supernatural. If you say, not if you think, not if you try, but if you speak, that's why your words have value, NOT EVEN PRAY. BUT JESUS SAID, IF you speak to if you say to this mountain, &gt;&gt; be thou removed and cast into the sea. Why did non have to dip one time, two times, three times, four times, five times to be healed of his leprosy? Because there was a connection between the physical Amen. &gt;&gt; And the non-physical. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to lose you here because it's very important. &gt;&gt; This is why we believe it's important to come to church. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not stream. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But come to church. This is why brother Brandon would even say and make comments along this and I don't have the quotes here before me that he says you he this is why we teach so many times that the anointing of God flows from the platform down to the people. &gt;&gt; That's why you ought to sit up closer to the front. Now, you laugh at that, but I'll show you a quote where brother Brandham is talking about the balcony and he says, "You know, not one time have I ever watched this the he says,"The spirit of God, the angel of the Lord up here on the platform. I've watched it go to person on this row, that row, that row." He said, "I've never seen it go all the way to the balcony." &gt;&gt; Now, you just think about that for a moment. &gt;&gt; You might sit in a different seat next next Sunday. &gt;&gt; You stay in the sound booth now. We need you up there. Okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the natural types, the spiritual, it's a very simple point, but it's profound that that that brother BRANDHAM WOULD SAY TO HADTIE, RIGHT? YOU KNOW, when she's sitting there, he's talking about Jehovah Gyron. And and brother Brandham's talking about, you know, Mark uh can't recall the scripture right now that greater work shall you do for I go unto the father. And brother Brandham's talking about Jehovah Gyron, the squirrels. And he says, "Hatty, you know," he says, "I don't know other what it was, Sister Haddie, other than than Jehov the same Jehovah Gyra." And sister Hadtie said, "Amen, brother Brandon. That's nothing but the truth." And when she spoke the right words, she said the right words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, you know, I could give you example after example. When Jesus and you know, goes to heal the blind person, you know, he he he spit on the dirt, he made clay, he rubbed it into Why do you go through ALL OF THIS? WHY NOT JUST SPEAK? HERE'S the Lord. HERE'S THE SON OF GOD, THE GIFT of God. But he goes through all of the PROCESS OF SPITTING ON THE GROUND, TAKING THE MUD, PUTTING IT ON THE man m on THE MAN'S EYES. WHAT ABOUT THE MAN? HE TELLS HIM TO GO TO THE POOL OF SILOMME and wash &gt;&gt; the blind man. &gt;&gt; Because there was a evidence that the natural types the spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in other words, what you do naturally is very important. This is why we don't just repeat a sinner's prayer. This is why we don't just have a mental agreement. It's wonderful to ra, you know, to, you know, to raise your hands to the word of God, but there's got to be something more than just even something that you do physically. It's got to move something into an unseen realm spiritually. Yes, &gt;&gt; I want to move through through through this, you know, because we we we got I got so much to cover that I I don't want to get bogged down uh here with some of this. So, you help me uh just pray for me tonight that I can just be uh sensitive to where the Lord where the Lord wants me to go and what we'll save for next time. So, baptism is an event that can have a spiritual effect. So you can see, you can begin to see how the Hebrew thinking of how burying, that's what we call it, burying someone and washing someone in a bath of water can clean them on the inside. It can wash their conscience. It can give them a fresh start. &gt;&gt; It could give them a clean slate. That's why we do it. That's why we believe in it. That's why we serve communion, another ordinance. It's why we have foot washing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can make a, you know, I I I I don't want to make light of that at all because I I believe that God instituted these things into the church because they were REAL PHYSICAL things &gt;&gt; that we have to do to be obedient to God. &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham says, we'll do these things. Jesus said that do this as often until I come in remembrance of me. &gt;&gt; And so we take communion. We search our lives. It ought not to be taken. We just took it. it ought not to be taken lightly. &gt;&gt; And and and and I think sometimes that's what what what we need is is because it's amazing because that that time when you know that you're about to take the Lord's supper and you're searching your life and you're turning over every stone and you're repenting of your sins and you're asking God to clean you, asking God to take anything that's you're you're surveying, you're taking inventory because that's what Jesus was teaching them. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. And he says, "Let a man examine himself." And so, let him look at his life. Let him look at HIS DESIRES. LET HIM LOOK at his ambitions. Let him look at his habits. Because out of those THINGS OF YOUR LIFE WILL TELL YOU. YOU DON'T NEED A PREACHER TO TELL YOU. You don't need a vision from God to tell you. Look at your life. It'll tell you whether you have the real thing or you don't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "Look at your life. It'll tell you whether you have the real thing or you don't. &gt;&gt; You got you you that you know it's very very very very simple. We make it sometimes so complicated but it's really not. &gt;&gt; You know I'm just going to stop here just for a moment. I just want to say some of these things because you know let me just say let me give you seven let me just give you seven things. We always talk about evidence of being born again. Let me give you seven signs that you're not born again. Can I do that? Is that okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because many people assume salvation because of baptism or a prayer or a church membership as brother Brandham said. They shake the preacher's hands and they they they put their name on a book. And brother said that'll make you no more a Christian. And he says then then then then anything doesn't matter how many churches how the church that you've joined who your pastor is because a true new birth a true the real thing IS NOT ABOUT A MOMENT. LET ME SAY IT THIS WAY. IT'S NOT A MOMENT IT'S A MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's actually a miracle that happens in your soul. &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE IN THE MIRACLE for the body. &gt;&gt; We believe in healing FOR THE BODY. WELL, THIS IS A MIRACLE THAT TAKES PLACE THAT HEALS YOUR SOUL. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And so the evidence of transformation, not reformation, but the evidence of transformation must be present. &gt;&gt; Must be. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to slow down because now I'm coming to the real thing that the Lord put upon my heart. And so &gt;&gt; I almost I almost just felt led to um in some ways just to read this, but I won't. I want to give you seven signs that you're not born again because I believe that the utmost important thing in our lives is that we have the real true new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. there could actually be nothing more important than I could teach my kids, nothing more important than I could teach uh uh uh you know my family. &gt;&gt; So you say, "What is what is an evidence?" I'll tell you one evidence that you've that you might have had a work of the Holy Ghost, but you've never truly been born again. There's no hunger for the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want these just to sink in here for a moment as they did me because the Bible says in 1 Peter 2:2, can you turn to these Gideon just quickly as you as I read some of these? I want to read them together. 1 Peter chapter 2 and uh I'll just pull them up also here just so that we can make sure we have them. I'm going to read them quickly. But 1 Peter 2:2 talks about a newborn baby. As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the experience, &gt;&gt; speaking in tongues, shouting, dancing, jumping. &gt;&gt; Come on. As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of church, youth groups, youth camps, &gt;&gt; this is what a true the real thing looks like. &gt;&gt; You desire the sincere milk of the word &gt;&gt; that you may grow thereby. So a true believer, a true experience craves the word. &gt;&gt; I I you know I I I I I just want to say that you know can I just suggest maybe just possibly can I can I just suggest this and I want to be careful how I say this. Can I suggest that sometimes we need a revival of reading our Bible &gt;&gt; that I believe that that that we need to get back to this book &gt;&gt; cuz I believe this is a lifechanging book &gt;&gt; and I'll just go ahead and you give brother Matt's opinion. This is brother 2026 opinions of brother Matt. They might change in 2027 but this is mine. You can take it or leave it. I don't I I I I would I I don't believe that reading the Bible I believe if you've got a phone that's a good thing. You read the Bible from your phone, that's a good thing, &gt;&gt; but that is not the same as reading it from this book. &gt;&gt; Now, that's my opinion. Take it or leave it. &gt;&gt; But I believe that your phone serves many purposes. &gt;&gt; It's a phone. It's a texting device. &gt;&gt; It's a check my social media device. It's a check my email device. It's a check my work schedule device. It's a check the score in the game device. &gt;&gt; It's a check their location device. It's a what did I miss device. But I tell you what this is. This doesn't have a check my text device or check the score device. This is a mirror &gt;&gt; that I get to look at my soul &gt;&gt; and ask my ask myself the question, where am I? Where where do I stand? Am I in the faith? Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you read the word from this physical book, it's very different than reading it from your phone. &gt;&gt; We ought to get back in our churches to where when the preacher opens his Bible, everyone opens a Bible with him. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, you tuned me out. It's all right. We'll keep going. &gt;&gt; I believe it'll do you some good. Can I just be honest with you? I need a fresh revival of this. &gt;&gt; So I'm not preaching at you. I'm preach and write it myself. I believe this is the only Listen friends, this is not a novel. It's not a history. It has lots of good history in it. Could be one of the greatest novels ever. But this is the Bible says this is the spirit of wisdom. &gt;&gt; So you want wisdom? Wisdom is knowledge is something you gain. Wisdom is a gift. &gt;&gt; And this is the only thing that'll give you real wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So a newborn baby, can we get back to it? craves the word. &gt;&gt; You lay in the word. NOT JUST PREACHERS. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE listening to God's prophet. That's why you're in your Bible. That's why you're reading the word of God. That's why you're doing that. Because you're craving it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO BE CORRECTED. YOU WANT TO BE CHASTISED. YOU WANT TO BE CHALLENGED. Come on. DO I HAVE ANY CHRISTIANS HERE? YOU WANT TO BE RENEWED. YOU WANT TO BE RESTORED. YOU WANT ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS. YOU WANT TO KNOW THE WILL OF GOD. YOU WANT TO YOU WANT YOU WANT PROBLEMS SOLVED. YOU WANT THE REAL THING. THIS IS WHERE YOU GET IT FROM. From feeding on the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just say it this way. IF THERE IS NO HUNGER, THEN THERE IS NO LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because there is no baby that is born that is alive that doesn't hunger. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell you another sign that you're not born again. You're comfortable living with sin. 1 John 3:9. Can you turn there with me? I hear Bibles maybe a little bit now. First John 1 John 3, chapter 3, verse 9. Uh, some of you don't even know how to get there in your Bible. &gt;&gt; First John, come on. Go right past James, &gt;&gt; right past Peter. Keep going till you get to First John. Listen to this here. 1 John chapter 3. Let's just begin reading. Whosoever is born, someone say this with me, born. Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit sin, for his seed remainth in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God. So, one of the evidences and I'm saying not not that a believer or a person who's really born again can't stumble. You will stumble. You will have mistakes, but you can't make peace with that stumbling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There will be something in your life that repels that part of you &gt;&gt; in so much. Not just that you're a lot because a lot was a was a borderline believer &gt;&gt; who was vexed by sin. There's a difference in being vexed by sin in your life. Brother Brandham says he was vexed by it, but he he didn't have the plain backbone to do anything about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. A true new birth won't let you stay in the vexed stage. &gt;&gt; It'll take you to the extermination phase to where you annihilate that sin in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And indifference towards sin is a terrifying sign that there's no spirit within &gt;&gt; because grace doesn't give permission to sin. Grace gives you power to overcome sin. &gt;&gt; Titus chapter 2 verse 11. Titus chapter 2. I'm going to wait on these. I feel like it's good to read them. Titus chapter 2 and we'll just read from verse 11 and also verse 12. You have that Gideon. For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men. Verse 12, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lives, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. So true grace teaches us to deny ungodliness. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I'll give you another sign that you're never have never truly been born again or that you don't have the real thing. Spiritual fruit, this is a tough one, is absent in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fruit of the spirit. Galatians 5 22. Let's read it together. Galatians 5 verse 22. You love the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad you do. I'm glad these aren't my words. These are the Lord's. But the fruit of the spirit is love, &gt;&gt; joy, peace, &gt;&gt; longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. So, YOU SAY, "BROTHER M, DOES THAT mean that IF I'M NOT ALWAYS MEEK, I'm not born?" That's not what I'm saying at all. I'm saying that if none of these fruits are a part of your desire that you're craving and and thirsting and saying, "God, express yourself through love, through temperance, through meekness, through gentleness, through joy, through peace, through longsuffering." &gt;&gt; If none of those are bearing fruit from your life, it's an evidence there's no life there. &gt;&gt; You can't take You can You can fake, let me say it this way, gifts. You can You can fake a gift. You can't fake real true the true nature of Jesus. Let me give you another sign. The love for the world over the love of God. This is one we know very well. 1 John chapter 2:15. 1 John 2 and verse 15. I love this. We know it very well. Someone read this with me. Love not the world, neither the things of the world. If any man love the world, the love of the father &gt;&gt; is is not in him. &gt;&gt; This is as clear as it gets to me. &gt;&gt; The love of the father, love not the world, nor the things of the in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. So, friendship of the world, James 4:4, is enmity with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just say it TO MAKE IT CLEAR. A real true new birth will never let you comfortable, make you comfortable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And have a place of comfort to where you're just happy to be here and you're ready just to kick it up, you know, you just kick your feet up and, you know, forget the rapture, forget heaven, man. I just rather just prolong this life as long as I can. A true believer feels out of place in this world. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I'll give you just another real simple, these are all real simple right out of the Bible. Another sign of no life is that there's no real transformation of life. 2 Corinthians 5:1 17 and I have it here if you can just pull it up quickly. Gideon 2 Corinthians chapter 5:1 17. Let's read it together. Therefore, if any man be in I can't hear hear you. He is a new creature. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So salvation, true change, the real thing brings visible visible visible token on display. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Old habits are broken. New desires are formed inside of that newborn baby. It's not perfection that I'm talking about. You say, "Brother Matt, I'm not you talking about perfection. I'm not talking about perfection. I'm talking about progression. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about not letting yourself stay the way that you are, but you're moving on to something to be transformed by the renewing of your mind." Is that what the Bible says? To be transformed by the renewing of the mind. because guilt or emotion. Let me just say this. It's wonderful to have guilt over sin and then you get emotional over that guilt. But but you can get emotional under the right preaching. Someone that's why brother Brandham says we don't believe in that beating someone on the back and you know mama going up there to the altar. That's all wonderful. But friends, for a real true new birth, it's something that happens outside of mama, daddy, what preacher says, it's something that strikes your soul. It's something that comes inside of you to where you're so sick and tired of yourself and your old ways and you want to die to yourself and your passion and your pride. You don't want to be you anymore. You you don't want to be the old self. You want to crucify who's ever in Christ is a new creation in Christ. AND I JUST SAY EVERY DAY, LORD, LET THE OLD MAN DIE. LET THE OLD HABITS DIE. LET THE OLD DESIRES DIE. I WANT TO HAVE A NEW h a new life. GIVE ME A NEW HABIT. A HABIT OF READING MY BIBLE. A HABIT OF PRAYING TO GOD. A HABIT OF COMING TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S NOT PERFECTION. It's progression. A baby that has life grows, &gt;&gt; matures. It grows. Philippians 1:16, he that hath begun a good work in you will complete it. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so th those were just seven just very quick, very simple, very basic, which is just the way I wanted it to be, the way the Lord put it upon my heart. You see, because true justification by faith is one of the foundational truths that we hold true. Not just the evidence or the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but there's got to be a state that you come to to where you are justified, &gt;&gt; sanctified. &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll never you'll never get to the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the real thing, if you're never truly justified. Can I just slow down here for a moment? You can't even know true peace &gt;&gt; and true rest until you are convinced that you could never be made right in the eyes of God by your own works. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will live in a constant state of toil and torment where the devil is always beating you up over your mistakes until you are justified. Listen, that's brother Brandham says that's that's the what is that? That's the That's not the judge looking at you and saying you were guilty. I know you murdered the man. You were guilty, but I'm going to choose to pardon you. That's wonderful. But he says real justification is when the judge says you were never guilty in the first place. You were trapped into it. You're not a murderer. That's not your identity. And you don't live with the conscious of that guilt. The worshipper once purged is free from the consciousness of sin. &gt;&gt; So if you don't understand that the perfect righteousness of JESUS IS YOURS BY FAITH, &gt;&gt; you'll lead a life of toil, sweat, spend your days trying to please God through outward works. And good works. And good works are good works. They're just that. It's good that you do them, but they won't save you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not at all. Let me say it this way. God wants our righteous works. &gt;&gt; Don't ever mistake that and say, "Our works are filthy righteousness, so we ought to not have works." That's a misinterpretation of the scripture. &gt;&gt; God wants your holy, righteous works, but they alone won't save you. &gt;&gt; But if you've really been saved, you'll produce. That's what James was saying. You'll produce real works. If there's a real saving faith, that saving faith will produce works in your life. And so this this God doesn't despise good works. He wants our righteous works. But if you think your good works is what allows you to merit salvation, I I just wish I could teach this so so I hope this is so clear. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, young people. Listen to me because this question gets asked so much. You hear all these phrases sometimes. I I just wonder sometimes if it's like a blur. You hear it so much in the Holy Ghost and new birth and the real thing and justification say and you know you can almost get to the point to where you just sort of tune those things out &gt;&gt; and and then church is just becomes a ritual and a cycle that you that you go through. &gt;&gt; I think we've lost a lot of people that way. We lost a lot of people who sat in churches, sat there for years hearing good preaching, preaching under the word of God, preach, you know, good teaching, solid, grounded, but were just tuned out. &gt;&gt; Never really engaged. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never really that moment to where you're you're you're making your calling an election sure. &gt;&gt; So, let me just in in in saying that, let me just slow down here for a moment. Because if you think good works merits your salvation, that they somehow allow you to stand holy because you've done a holy thing. As as God says, I think it's in Isaiah, that your righteousness is as filthy rags. &gt;&gt; Filthy rags. A stench in my nostril. &gt;&gt; And And you know what? That we feel good. I'll just be honest with you. We feel good when we do good things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We feel good. You know, you you you get this moment of victory that, you know, I you know, I've resisted temptation and I resisted that thing and I feel good about myself, you know, and I didn't do it. I didn't fall. I didn't give into this and you know, I did the right thing and I could have thrown my temper, but I didn't do it. And must be a good Christian. There's probably days when you think you've overcome. Man, I've really overcome. And I'm a real overcomer. You know, I that little thing that always snag me up and always gets me. And you know, for a moment you feel I think God sometimes does that just for a moment you feel righteous. &gt;&gt; God's favor's upon me. I must be going the right direction. You know, the problem is that you're setting yourself up &gt;&gt; if you think it had anything to do with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because then the next day when you fail, &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, your your faith is shipwrecked. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you fall back into it and then suddenly your joy is linked and your praise is linked and now we link our salvation to whether we make a mistake or not. &gt;&gt; See how the devil attaches that and then he keeps a person in a constant cycle of beating you up, you know, over things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and this is exactly what sin does. It's causes you to begin to hide from God. This is what sin did in the garden. It caused man to hide from God. Adam, Adam, where aren't you? I was afraid, so I hid myself. It's what David did when David fell in sin with Ba Sheeba. What started in secret and he kept it a secret and he allowed to nurture that sin. And that sin became more than a thought. It turned from a thought into a deed, an action. &gt;&gt; And then it gets worse cuz sin always gets worse. &gt;&gt; Sin is like a snowball going down the mountain. It just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. And before you know it, David's not only fallen out of in sin with Bath Sheba, now he murders the her husband, has him killed, covers the whole thing up. It's a big secret. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and then tries to live in that lie. &gt;&gt; And he says later, is it Psalms 56? And he's starting to say, I you know, when I was silent about my sin, my bones achd. &gt;&gt; He says they achd all night long. And it it started to affect him. He couldn't sleep and he was living with that thing &gt;&gt; and and then it snowballs from that and then they have a baby and then the whole thing the whole cover up and here comes the prophet and he gives the story about the lamb and you know the rich man you know you know took of the poor man's lamb and and and he says he loved that lamb who he loved and he nurtured and he raised and drank ate at his table. This is what Samuel is saying to David. That lamb was precious to him. He's talking about Uriah and he's and he's and he's, you know, he took of the poor man's lamb and didn't take of his own, but took of the poor man's lamb instead instead. And David in his self-righteousness. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing how sin is so can hide itself so much that he's HE'S LIVING IN OUTRIGHT SIN. HE'S LIVING IN OUTRIGHT ADULTERY. &gt;&gt; AND YET HE'S A CHRISTIAN. Yet he's a believer. YET HE'S HE'S GOING TO GET INDIGNANT. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES SIN CAN SO DESENSITIZE A PERSON TO WHERE THEY THERE'S so many layers and there's just layers upon layers of religion AND CHRISTIANITY AND REPUTATION AND PEOPLE AND FRIENDS. CAN I JUST SAY I JUST FEEL I FEEL THE UNCCTION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. I'D RATHER BE A A DRUNK. I'D RATHER BE A SINNER ON ON THE STREET KNOWING THAT'S WHO I AM AND EVERYBODY KNOWING WHO THAT THAT'S WHO I AM THAN TO BE A A PERSON WHO NAMES THE NAME OF CHRIST AND AND SAYS I'm a Christian but living a SEPARATE LIFE AS THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID LET ME DIE LET ME DIE A SINNER BUT NOT A HYPOCRITE. DON'T EVER LET ME STAND BEFORE GOD. LET ME BE WHO I AM AND SAY GOD THIS IS THE REAL ME AND I need the real thing. THIS IS THE REAL PERSON AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A DISGUISE OR A MASK ANYMORE. I WANT TO TAKE MY MASK OFF AND SAY, "GOD, I'M A SINNER. I I I need salvation. I need the real THING IN MY LIFE." OH, GOD. THAT'S THE KIND OF MAN GOD can fill with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But help us to be real. &gt;&gt; OH, HOW MANY WANT THAT WITH ME? Let me be real, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me be who I really am, not a fake. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD CAN'T EVEN DEAL WITH THE FAKE. &gt;&gt; Be who you are. &gt;&gt; David gets MAD AND ANGRY. LET THIS MAN, THE MAN WHO HAS DONE THIS THING, he shall surely die. &gt;&gt; And Samuel says, "You are the man." &gt;&gt; Now, I didn't tell you where a real Christian stands. That David could have got mad. How dare you, Samuel. You could have waited till we were in the back room in the back office. You did it right out here in church and everybody was watching and everybody was listening. &gt;&gt; How dare you expose me? That's not what a true a real Christian does. &gt;&gt; A real believer a real believer begins to repent. And the Bible says that David after he was confronted with Samuel fell to his face. &gt;&gt; Begin to call out to God. this this justification. I'm getting God 48 minutes. I've got 12 left. You just stay with me. &gt;&gt; You love them. You love the Lord. And he says, you may this is this is this is really, you know, because this is where we get to to where it's a roller coaster ride of emotional highs and emotional lows and you think the Lord's angry with you. And &gt;&gt; you know, I I I I I got to that place. I was even even witnessing this is back here some number of months ago right before youth camp and I was I was going to baptize and and marry a couple and I'm just you know they they wanted to be baptized and I just I sat down with them and I here's what my whole message to them was. said, "Before we baptize, before we take you to the water, it's a wonderful thing. You're wanting to be baptized. Start your, you know, I asked him, why do you want to be why are you wanting to be baptized? What's your what's your reason?" Well, had a wonderful, wonderful desire. Real sincere said, "We've we've done things the wrong way up to this point. We're about to get married. We want to do things the right way. We want to start the right way." What a noble desire. And I'll never forget sitting there in that living room with them and I told him, I said, 'You know, here's what I here's where here's where my heart is. I so bad don't want you to be disappointed. I said, disappointed? That's probably what they were thinking. I said, because so many times people can have such an expectation &gt;&gt; that it's just a one time I get baptized, go in the water, pray a prayer, come up to an altar. Come on, friends. We're a lot of times we're no different. &gt;&gt; You know, just that one time we we're going to go to this certain meeting, this certain preacher and going to feel this certain moment and that's going to settle it all. And then what you find is because there is no real change. There's no growth. There's no craving of the word. There's no there's no real true uh um if I could say real true honesty with self. and it's just all about a moment or something they can do. I said, so many people start off that way and think it's all over and then the battle really begins &gt;&gt; and then they leave because they're they leave disappointed &gt;&gt; cuz they didn't get the real thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they they they they go on this endless roller coaster. And I told him, I said, "I I want to make sure that we do this right because unless your baptism is started with real repentance, &gt;&gt; and I just talked to them for probably 30 minutes about what it really means to repent, what it really means, not just even a prayer that you pray, but when you really face yourself for who you really are, that in you there is no good thing. and you don't want to be you you you're you're not looking for anything that you can do other than admit and come to a real honest confession &gt;&gt; to say, "Lord, I am I am I have been wrong. I am wrong. There's nothing about me good and I'm sick of sin. Not the effects of sin, but I'm tired of sin. I'm tired of pleasure. I I don't just WANT TO BE A I LISTEN. GOD DIDN'T JUST COME TO take us to heaven. But he he came to even while we're here on earth to deliver us from this present world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is really what I'm preaching to you on that the real thing delivers you from this present world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if not, it's a roller coaster of up and down and hot and cold and sin and confess and sin and confess and repent according to how everything's based upon how good or how bad or how good your track record is. And maybe on a particular day you're doing good, but on another day you're doing bad. You're up one day you're down another day. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when we turn to the Lord, can I say with real true saving faith is a faith that is you turn to the Lord and you empty out yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You empty out. You become one with the Lord. And and that and that in and of itself is what credits you because the righteousness of Jesus, as brother Brandham said, is credited to your account. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All your sins are washed away because of his work, not our work. &gt;&gt; And we're one, as the Bible says, JOINT HES. AND NOT ONLY ARE WE ONE IN JESUS, can I say we are complete in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, can I get a Christian to help me preach? Because at the cross, our old man was crucified with its fleshly desires and its fleshly lust and all of its self-righteousness and all of its striving and all of its toiling. IT WAS ALL DONE AWAY WITH IN GOD'S EYES WHEN GOD SAID ON THE CROSS, "IT IS FINISHED." HE WAS SAYING, "YOUR WORK IS FINISHED. YOUR TOIL IS FINISHED." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And now you can stand before me as a righteous, perfect, righteous man in Jesus. Because all who are in him are forgiven. Someone say forgiven. &gt;&gt; Accepted and counted as righteous &gt;&gt; in the sight of God. We are justified. That's what true justification is. To be made right in God's sight by our faith in the work that Jesus did on the cross. &gt;&gt; Because the Lord accepts nothing but his righteousness. And there's only way to have perfect righteousness and that's the righteousness of Jesus Christ because he perfect he perfectly fulfilled the demands of justice that were demanded by the law. His death satisfied forever the justice of God regarding sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that I can I'm glad, you know, for my good days. But let me just tell you, they're not all good days. But I'm so glad that there's a grace to cover me when I don't have a good day. There's a go. I'm glad because I don't always feel like I'm a good Christian. BUT EVEN WHEN I DON'T FEEL LIKE A GOOD CHRISTIAN, IN GOD'S EYES, I'M PERFECT IN CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU OUGHT TO LET that give you joy tonight TO SAY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I FEEL LIKE. BECAUSE A LOT of times I don't feel like much, but that doesn't matter cuz his word says I am free in Christ. &gt;&gt; My sin was judged on the cross. Yes. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And so, NONE OF THOSE THINGS, NONE OF THOSE THINGS you can count. You can't count on any good work. I'm just preaching you very simply on justification. And this is all we'll get to tonight. We'll move on next, Lord willing. Uh uh the next time. Oh, all of those things. You can count any of those things. I don't care what you want to name here tonight. You're good. You know, the the the the good people. And and you I'm I'm not I'm not even making a distinction between that, but you know, good, clean, moral, faithful people, folks who don't cheat, folks who don't lie, steal, drink, smoke, drugs, gamble, you know, uh uh gossip, &gt;&gt; all of those things Christians ought to live. You say, "Brother Matt, what is that?" That's what a Christian ought that's how a Christian ought to live. &gt;&gt; But let me just say, none of those things will will get you through. &gt;&gt; None of those things will save you. None of those good works will get you in a rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't count on any of them to obtain favor or acceptance with God. &gt;&gt; Somehow people think that they'll stand before God on the basis of their good work so that they were good to animals. I've heard a man tell me that before. He's he'll go to heaven because he was good to animals. &gt;&gt; That's good to be good. It's good to be good people. It's good to be good to animals. Good to be good good you. But but you know it's one thing to be good to animals. How about that you take that same love for people? Amen. &gt;&gt; But none of those things matter. That's my sermon. That's that's not part of the real thing. &gt;&gt; Those things are good, but none of them really matter in God's sight. We all have to understand one simple truth. We can be justified only by a revelation because faith is a revelation &gt;&gt; of the work. What is the baptism of the Holy Ghost? It's a revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Is that what God's prophet taught us? &gt;&gt; It's a revelation of Jesus to you personally that he died for your sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he rose and when you he rose, you rose with him &gt;&gt; and you're justified by faith. Not by works, but by faith in Christ. &gt;&gt; That simple work justifies. It's not enough to be justified, but you ought to be justified. You got to be justified. &gt;&gt; And this is where so many Christians, you can even say this because let me just tell you the rest of the story. I I it's if you go no further than justification and BY FAITH. IF YOUR DOCTRINE if all of your life ends to say I'm justified with Christ by faith and then that's all that I need. Let me just say friend you that you're in you're in great danger in that spot. And in fact, you're more in more danger than before God justified you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because because let me just say this. I'll be careful how I say it, but one of the most dangerous places that a person can be is clean but empty. &gt;&gt; You You'd been better to be dirty and full of sin than to be clean but devoid of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that what your Bible says? says it Matthew chapter 8 and Jesus says when the unclean spirit goes out of a man he he he you know he goes in a dry place he comes back the house is swept clean but he findeth no one there then he goes and gets him seven other spirits worse and he says Jesus says the state of the man is worse &gt;&gt; clean and empty than before when he was dirty and full &gt;&gt; because one of the most dangerous places to be is in church &gt;&gt; say brother Matt did you say that right one of the most dangerous places to be is in church Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because you're held accountable for the truth that you &gt;&gt; hear. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so as truth is being preached, you've got a choice to either reject it, resist it, or humble ourselves and accept it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so here's where Christians fail. They say, "I'm righteous because of Christ or or I I am the righteousness." Let me just let me just say it this way. The perfect righteousness of Christ is not infused or somehow poured in as we can say it that way. BUT WE ARE ACCOUNTED RIGHTEOUS. ABRAHAM WAS IT WAS ACCOUNTED unto him OF RIGHTEOUSNESS BECAUSE GOD'S EYES WASN'T LOOKING AT ABRAHAM. NOR IS HIS EYES looking at you. But when he looks at you, he sees the blood. AND THE BLOOD IS WHAT JUSTIFIES ME. NOT MY WORKS. It's the blood. I'VE GOT A PERFECT SACRIFICE. YOU SAY, "BROTHER MATT, ARE YOU PERFECT?" I'M NOT. BUT I'VE GOT A PERFECT LAMB. AND WHEN GOD LOOKS AT MY SIN, HE DOESN'T SEE IT. HE SEES MY SACRIFICE. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WHAT ABOUT YOUR WORKS? IF IT'S A BAD DAY, DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A DOWN DAY, a low day, an out day, God's blood still atones for my sins." &gt;&gt; And so that that this is this is what Paul was preaching. This revelation of being justified by the perfect righteousness of Christ. I've been one hour. I'm going to close right here. And so this is what it really means. As brother Brandham says, true justification by faith. Listen, I'm just going to read a few things and I'm just going to close. That when God comes in you and regenerates your life, &gt;&gt; because brotherham taught that the true Holy Ghost, the true baptism, the real thing, the real thing. You say, "Brother Matt, I heard all of this as a child. Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost, new birth. What is it? Let me make it simple. I'm going to give you simple because I because we received it simple by a simple prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who made it so simple? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is literally literally the spirit of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; coming to dwell in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It is literally the literal life. What is the Holy Ghost? It's what brother Brandham says here. What is the Holy Ghost? What is the Holy Ghost? It is the spirit of Christ in you. It's the seal. It's a covenant. It's a sign. It's the spirit of Jesus Christ in you. In other words, the Holy Ghost is the comforter that Jesus promised that he would send. Christ's own spirit returning to indwell his people. Brother Adam says it this way. I love this so much. And what is the Holy Ghost? He says it's God's open door. It's a sign. It's a seal. It's a comforter. It's an advocate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That means it's my lawyer. It's my attorney. It speaks for me. &gt;&gt; It is the assurance. It is rest. It's peace. It's goodness. It's healing. It's life. It's God's open door to Christ. So then a true believer, listen, a true believer, the Holy Ghost is the very presence of God, the pillar of fire, the spirit of God living inside, bringing new life, craving for new new things, craving that you say, Brother Matt, what craves the word of God in you? Not me. The Holy Ghost inside of me is craving to feed upon the word, &gt;&gt; bringing new life, bringing the power of God into the believer's life. Brother Brandham says that that same Holy Spirit would was sent to continue the works of Jesus in the church. He says here, if that spirit living in Jesus Christ made him do and act the way he did, you'll have some general idea how he'll do when it's in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that life cannot change. Say, "Brother Matt, what what is make it make it clear? The Holy Ghost is Christ himself in spirit form coming to the believer as a seal &gt;&gt; of redemption, &gt;&gt; an earnest a down payment &gt;&gt; of a future full redemption." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When God changes our body, &gt;&gt; musicians, could you come? Say, "Brother Matt, who can receive it? Who's it for? Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, to your children, to them that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. As many as he shall call. &gt;&gt; Amen. across all time, all families, all generations. God, brother Brandham says, will fill every soul that's earn that earnestly hungers for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just want to say, Lord, maybe as we just preached here today, and I'm stopping now, every head bowed and every eye closed, maybe just a real simple prayer you could pray. And maybe it would just be this. Lord, will you make me to hunger and make me to thirst? I can't do that, Lord, but you can. May the Holy Ghost so hunger, so thirst to get to such a place, Lord, that it's more than my daily bread. That I thirst for it more than I thirst for water. That I hunger for it more than I hunger for life. Make me to hunger, Lord. It's a gift. It's freely given, but and it's an experience I could have, but even after I have it, I've got to feed the Holy Ghost inside of me. &gt;&gt; I've got to feed it. Lord, that's my sincere prayer out of a sincere place in my heart. Could you stand to your feet tonight, everyone around, and raise your hands up and say, "Lord, I that's my sincere request, my sincere desire is I want the real thing, Lord. I want the real thing. Not a generated, not not just a dress code, not just a rule book, not just a church I was raised in, not just something my parents taught me, not something that the I've heard the preacher talk about, not cuz I fear going to hell, not cuz I fear tribulation. That that that's that may be one stage in your life. That's why you come to church. You're afraid of missing the rapture. afraid of. But friends, oh but can I say a relationship with Jesus when you really know him, you don't love him out of fear. You don't serve him out of out of fear and what'll happen if you you know it's not cuz you fear hell. You've got a revelation you'll never go to hell. You've got a revelation you're part of him. But when you really know him, it's just like your best friend. Someone you can talk to. Someone you could pour your heart out to. Someone you could pour your burdens. Take your needs to. Say, "Lord, I want to know you. Here's my simple prayer. Lord, I want the real thing. I don't want something fake. I don't want to be a fake. I don't want to be a hypocrite. I want to be who I am, Lord. And I want the real the real evidence, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Not what someone has told me, but not just a work, not chasing an emotion, not chasing some kind of thing. I WANT TO KNOW THAT I'VE GOT A HOLD OF THE real thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to know it. Lord Jesus, your prophet told me it ain't a hope. So, it's a no. So, and I want that no so down in my soul. I want to be so justified in my heart as though I never did it in the first place. My legal status has been changed in the eyes of God. I'm accepted based upon his perfect sacrifice. Jesus, grant to every heart, every life, every hand that was raised. I pray God that you would take these words, Lord, that I've spoken, God, and may they just begin to work in someone's heart, Lord. How could it be, Father, that Lord, maybe it would be that someone would hear this here tonight, Lord, that would start just something down on the inside, maybe push back the darkness just enough to let the word, the light of the word of God, shine down into that seed, and it just starts something maybe so small, Lord, but may it lead to a life that surrenders to you, dedicates their heart to you. That's why we preach. That's why we gather. That's why we study. That's why we pour out our lives, Lord. It's God's for one simple purpose. So that someone might know you in the power of salvation and the power of true saving faith. In the power of real transformation, the real thing. Grant it Jesus. Grant it Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. From this time on and ever more. Oh my hope is in the Lord forever more. Oh, let's sing this. I stand in all. I stand in awe within the presence of the Lord. In whom and whom the wisdom of the aes lie. Oh, in whom the raing of the sea subside, the living sacrifice, living sacrifice, the only source of life. My hope always is in the wall. From this time on and never my hope, yes it is, is in the Lord forever more. His tender mercy, oh his tender mercies come with every rising sun to meet to meet the sinner in his brokenness to offer healing and forgiving. Oh, and those who trust, this is a promise. Oh yes, will find their heart. Oh, let's raise our hands now. My hope is in the Lord. From this time on and ever more. Oh my hope. Yes, it is. Oh, I want to let the world know forever more. Oh, let Jesus know. My hope is in the Lord. Oh, my hope. Oh, my hope is in the Lord. From this time on and ever more. Oh my hope is in the Lord forever more. Brother Jack guest says uh this is no I'm yes January 7th continued prayer for sister Kathy for a full recovery. I want to just read Brother Jack texted me on Monday said big capitals. I love it.

And uh there's some believers there they might get a chance to go to and visit the church there. Not really sure. They're not sure yet, but amen. How many would have a need something upon your heart? Maybe you just want to raise your hand to the Lord. Jesus, my hands up right now. Lord, I identify with this song. My hope is in you, Lord. It's not in myself, not in my works. Lord, I'm so glad of that. So glad to know I've been forgiven. So glad to know my sins are in the past. They're covered by the blood. All the ordinances that were written out against me, you nailed to a cross. And as the song says, I will bear them no more. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. It is well with my soul. My sin. Oh, the bliss of that glorious thought. My sin, not in part, but the whole. Jesus, I'm gr I'm grateful tonight, Lord. Maybe in a way that I've never been before for that atonement that you made for me on Calvary. I want a new revel. I want a new revival, Lord. Let this book, let this Bible, give me a revival, God, to pick it up, to make it my daily bread, to make it the compass of my life, Lord. Not just a I'm not, not just to read it, Lord, but for you to speak through it, Jesus, that I may hear your spirit talk to me, leading me, guiding me, answering questions, dissolving doubts, removing fears, removing complexes. I pray, God, that you'd give our church that. May we fall in love with you all over again. I pray that you'd give our young people the real thing. Give my children the real thing that if they don't have it, Lord. Give all of our young people, all the old wouldn't matter, Lord. Lord, how long we've been in this journey. We want the real thing. Jesus. I believe it's drawing more and more, Lord, to a place, God, at time wrapping up and moving so fast, Lord, we ought to every day, as the Bible says, to make our calling and election sure. Let it be Jesus, for that foolish virgin and that wise virgin, the difference was that she was she had oil, Lord, and she was burning with oil. She was burning the midnight oil. I want to say, God, let me go into this year burning with a fresh zeal. Oh, how many wanted in here tonight to SAY, "LET IT. LET this year be a year I'm more zealous than I was last year. I'm more on fire, more fervent, more passionate than I was, Jesus. I want to see you more real in my life. Pray that you would do it, Jesus. Grant these requests to those that are still recovering. Sister Kathy. Lord, I pray God that you would your angel of healing would just do a complete work in her life.

May you just be be the watch over it, Lord. You're our portion. You're our defender. You're our refuge. You're a strong and mighty tower, Lord. And we look to you now for all of these needs on behalf of all these unspoken requests. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. We're going to let you be dismissed at your own leisure. Amen. Lord willing, we'll see you. Okay. Okay, I'll do it. Amen. You can stop here for a moment. I I did get a reminder. I tried to get this in on Sunday, but I wasn't able to. So, I I would be remiss not to share it now. And for those that haven't heard, and maybe those on the online can hear it, the Lord just did something uh really spared our life. The devil's always uh prowling and always trying to um do anything. Brother Brandham said that he said if he could take me out, he'd do it. And so, but the angels of God, I believe, are watching over his children watching over us last Saturday um about sometime in the day. I make this as maybe briefing. Gideon text me if I get it anything wrong or say leave something out. He's good about keeping it. Uh I'll and I mean that because I'll skip over things and uh don't mean to. But um we had our out there on property. We have a propane tank and uh they had came out the uh uh it was told to fill it when it hit 30%. So after Thanksgiving and all the cooking of Christmas, I went out there and checked it and it was at 25 between 25 and 30. Had a man come out initially said he needed me to clear a little pathway. Couldn't fill it. Then I had Saturday, it was Friday, Saturday, a man called me and from Frell and uh he uh said he wanted to come out fill the tank. I said, "Well, we need to clear a path." He said, "Uh, you know, I can get to it. Don't worry about it. I'll fill it, you know, fill it up for you." I said, "Well, I'm not home." You know, he said, "Is anybody home?" I said, "Yeah, my wife's home. You can go there. It'll be fine." So, he went out there and he and he uh filled the tank. He called me back. He said, "I put 85 gallons in it and you're good to go. You're, you know, you're good. You know, you left the receipt with your family." So, I got home about 6:00 p.m. I don't know what time it was around 6:00 that evening, me and Ethan. And uh and I I I the garage door before I'd gotten home had got left open apparently, but when I got home, it was closed. So I I I was in the house. We were just about to cook maybe start dinner and I was going to take a shower and I went out before in my in my garage. I have a refrigerator with some um uh just some refreshments. And so I went in there and and grabbed a a soda and I a drink and I I when I opened the garage door, I smelled really really strong smell of propane. and with the garage door shut and I thought, "Wow, you know, I'm a plumber. I smell gas, especially, you know, that smell all the time." Immediately knew what it was. And uh and so uh I I thought I told Rachel, I said, "There's there's a there's um a really strong smell of um of gas in my garage in the garage." I said, "Is there a propane tank, a cylinder maybe from the turkey fryer or something we left?" She said, "No, there's nothing." She said, "I smelled it, too. Really, really strong smell." And so I um I said, "That's" She said, "That's You sure that's gas?" I said, "Yeah, that's definitely gas." So, I'm looking around. Are you sure there's no propane tank in here? And she said, "Well, the garage door was left open and they filled the tank up today." So, I said, "Okay." I raised the garage door. I walked outside. It was dark and I just smelled as best I could right there in my driveway and couldn't smell nothing. Tank's about 30 ft away in the woods. Didn't smell anything. So, I went back in, took a shower, closed the garage door, and I thought, I better just go check that tank just to make sure. It's how propane is, for those of you that don't know, is is not like natural gas. Natural gas is lighter than air, so it lifts. propane does and it's heavy and it and it stays on the ground. It'll you know if it if the due point's real low it will really just spread out and uh and it's real dangerous. It's highly explosive way more dangerous than natural gas. And um and so I uh I went as I'm you know just getting out of the bathroom I I thought well I'm going to go out there and check it. So I get dressed. I get my flashlight and I start walking how family's just doing things. I walk towards the tank. I didn't get just right when I got to the wood line, I smelled it really strong. And I thought, "Wow, that's that's a bad leak. That's a really bad leak. I know what a bad leak is. That's a bad leak. It's really thick and strong." And so I immediately just turned around and I'm worried now. I learned later that it thankfully it's not, but we have a our house is way off the road, so we have a big old green box transformer. And I thought maybe it could be a source of ignition. Good to know. They're not. They're made that way to not be, but I thought and that's only 20 feet from my tank. I'm thinking if that gas propane is very explosive. And so if it gets over there and ignites, we're in trouble. And um and so I immediately called called the gas company emergency line. They said, you know, the on call techni technicians, you know, coming uh he'll call you. And so I I I get a call. I called the fella, you know, that uh anyway, move on past that. But the the man calls me on Call Tech and he says, "Hey, uh, you know, my name is this." And he says, "I'm on my way out." And he says, "You think you got a gas leak?" I said, "No, I know I got a gas leak." I said, "I'm a you know, I'm a plumber. I smell this all the time. There's definitely a real strong gas leak. A good a goodsized one." And I said, "I don't know if it's even safe to be here." He says, "Well, do you see a plume uh of smoke, you know, of of, you know, because that's what propane looks like. It looks like a Halloween scene. If you ever seen it really leaking out, it has like a mist and a fog." He says, "There are white plume." So, I shine my flashlight from my back porch about 30 ft away and there's nothing. So, I'm on the phone with him. I go back in. He says, "Look at the receipt. How many gallons did he put in it?" I said, "So, I look at the receipt. I'm looking and and it says 85.6." And I said, "85.6." He said, "Okay, well, you know, 250 and you know that's 85." He said, "That's good." You know, and he he says, "You sure there's no white plume?" So, I said, "Well, let me go check." So, I open the door again and while I'm standing out there, I hear um what if I just rather than imitating if you've ever unplugged an relief valve on an air compressor, that's exactly what it sounded like. And the blowoff valve, which is only is an emergency valve that goes on a propane tank and expels at 150 PSI the gas blew on that thing. This is loud. He heard it on the phone. And and when he heard that, he he he really got panicky and he started yelling saying, "Get your family out of your house now. Run. Get out of there. Call 911 now. Get away from the home." So we go into mode of getting everybody quick. I I realized my family needs to practice some stop, drop, and roll. And need to do some fire drills. And uh because we we you know anyway um and I'm not good. I'm I'm not good. Uh I'm I take after my mom. I'm I'm probably not good in in in you know I'm not the guy who's cool and calm and collected when it's when it's really uh need when I need to be. And so I was really panicking and I said get out everybody get out now. I'm on the phone. I hang up the phone. I'm trying to dial 911. He's telling me call the fire department. They got to shut it down. We go off with the animals and we're going up Jasmine Hall Road just as fast as barefooted. Me I think me and Ethan didn't have nothing. No didn't have no socks on. everybody's, you know, just running up the road trying to get away. And, you know, in your mind, you're thinking, you know, it's going to be just blowing up right behind you. And uh and so we get all the way down the road. We start walking up Jasmine Hall Road just waiting for the fire department. Now I'm trying to call Dominion to tell them, "Shut your transformer off, source of ignition." Here comes the fire department. We hadn't been on that road for 5 minutes, and here it comes. You could smell the propane on the road a thousand feet away from my house. And um you could smell it so strong. Fire department got there. They parked on the road. Several trucks. He's firefighters running at me. Where's the tank? Where's the tank? I'm trying to explain to him and where the tank is. He goes running. They go running up the the road and and uh they get it off. He comes back. He says, "Thank God we got it off." He says, "It's you, you know, it's not safe to go back right now." uh of you know whatever he said there, you know, we we didn't feel it was with all the smell and you could still smell it real real strong and um and so you know time elapsed and we I think we were out there um I think it uh yeah we couldn't start our our cars um you know because it would have it could have caused been a source of ignition and um I called my neighbor right away Steve the one closest to us are you guys home he said no we're in North Carolina said thank god got a situation. And so, uh, the firefighters got it off. He comes back and he and he and he and he, you know, after I think it was over two hours, something like that, we were on the road and, um, trying to hold the dogs down, trying to keep everybody calm. I was getting bit by fire ants and have no shoes on. And and so, so we finally make our way back and and it's safe to go back. Firefighters, you know, different ones are filling the effects. get checked out by EMS, feeling the effects of real drowsy Gideon was. Prayed for him. He was, you know, filling, you know, the effect of being under with all that propane, just everything. And and so um the the firefighter got off. Then the feral gas man showed up and uh he looked at it and he's trying to solve why did it blow why did the blowoff valve go off? What's wrong? The tank was just filled. What started this? How could this have happened? And and so he's looking at it and thank God I had brother Joe how shell and uh so thankful for for brother Joe and and I I called him cuz he couldn't the man couldn't solve it. And so he says something to Joe about 85 gallons in a 250. And Joe says that's not a 250 that's a 120. And he said what? He said that's a 120. Well, for those of you who don't know, you can't fill a propane cylinder up over 80%. Because it's liquid and vapor and with any kind of heat or anything, it turns it it it, you know, evaporates and vaporizes and and if there's no wear, no room for it to go. If the blowoff valve, the man said if the blowoff valve wouldn't have worked, you'd lost your home and your neighbor's home. And he said, "Thank God the blowoff valve worked to blow the gas out. That's the point. It's a safety device. And if you watch a video of it, it it's a like a nuc it's like a mini nuclear bomb. It's what it looks like. Big mushroom clown. And he said this is he said this is really the grace of God. That's what the propane man told me. He said that you guys were home could call. He said this could have been a catastrophic event. And um and they found out that the man who filled it mistook it for a 250 and it was a 120. So when we did the math, we had 115 gallons in a 120galon tank. And so it was just the grace of God. I just want to give God thanks. Amen. That he kept us and watched over us and protected our family. Amen. Amen. And so uh we're thankful to God. Aren't you glad God keeps watch over his people? Amen. We're going to let you go. We'll see you, Lord willing, this weekend. You are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. Oh, there is no one else like you. Oh, you are great.
