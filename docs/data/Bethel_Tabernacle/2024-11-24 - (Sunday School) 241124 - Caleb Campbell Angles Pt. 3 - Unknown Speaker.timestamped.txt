[0:45] ahead and turn into our Bibles we're
[0:47] going to turn to proverbs 4 and verse 7
[0:50] we're taking a a part three today on uh
[0:54] a little thing I've been doing on
[0:56] angles um so proverbs 4 and verse 7
[1:01] chap proverbs 4 and verse 7 says wisdom
[1:05] is the principal thing therefore get
[1:08] wisdom and with all thy getting get
[1:10] understanding these are the same
[1:12] scriptures that we opened with the last
[1:14] couple of times James chapter 1 and
[1:16] verse 5 says if any of you lack wisdom
[1:20] let him ask of God that giveth to all
[1:22] men liberally and abrath not and it
[1:24] shall be given to him amen God bless you
[1:28] as you take your seats this morning so I
[1:30] want to cover just a few highlights um
[1:33] from last Sunday just to give background
[1:36] but we're going to pick up the reading
[1:37] from 2 Corinthians chapter 12 that I
[1:41] kind of ended with last time um 2
[1:44] Corinthians chapter 12 and verses one a
[1:46] familiar reading for us I'm sure Paul
[1:49] would write it is not expedient for me
[1:51] to doubt for me doubtless to Glory I
[1:54] will come to visions and Revelations of
[1:56] the Lord I knew a man in Christ above 14
[1:59] years ago whether in body I cannot tell
[2:01] or whether out of body I cannot tell God
[2:03] knoweth such as one caught up in the
[2:05] third heaven and I knew such a one such
[2:07] a man whether in the body or out of the
[2:09] body I cannot tell God knoweth how that
[2:11] he was caught up into paradise and
[2:12] heared unspeakable Words which is not
[2:14] lawful for a man to utter of such unwill
[2:17] I will glory yet of myself I will not
[2:19] Glory but in mine infirmities for though
[2:21] I would desire to Glory I should not be
[2:23] a fool for I will say the truth but now
[2:26] I forbear lest any man should think of
[2:28] me above the that which he seeth me to
[2:31] be or that he heareth of me and lest I
[2:35] should be exalted above measure through
[2:36] the abundance of Revelations there was
[2:39] given to me a thorn in the flesh the
[2:41] messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I
[2:43] should be exalted above measure for this
[2:46] thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it
[2:48] might depart from me and he said unto me
[2:50] my grace is sufficient for thee for my
[2:53] strength is made perfect in weakness
[2:55] most gladly therefore will I glory in my
[2:57] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[2:59] rest upon me therefore I take pleasure
[3:02] in infirmities in reproaches in
[3:05] Necessities in persecutions and
[3:07] distresses for what for Christ's sake
[3:10] for when I am weak then I am strong and
[3:13] you know the first part of that chapter
[3:15] you know we're talking about this trial
[3:17] that Paul was facing this this infirmity
[3:19] you know and he sought the Lord uh for
[3:22] three times three different occasions
[3:25] and there was a vision involved and this
[3:27] was obviously a very big part of Paul's
[3:30] life because a whole chapter was
[3:32] dedicated to this time and finally Paul
[3:34] came to this revelation of the situation
[3:37] of this trial that the Lord allowed him
[3:39] to see that his suffering in this matter
[3:42] was actually a blessing in disguise it
[3:45] was actually the working of God's grace
[3:48] in his life maybe and he even said this
[3:50] maybe to keep him humble in some aspect
[3:53] maybe it was to show an example and this
[3:56] is this is something that we can all
[3:58] benefit from but maybe was Show an
[4:00] example for the next several thousand
[4:02] years that all believers are able to
[4:04] look at this chapter and give thanks in
[4:07] all things amen for this is the will of
[4:10] Christ concerning you 1 Thessalonians
[4:12] 55:18 you are to give thanks in all
[4:15] things you are to give thanks in those
[4:16] infirmities even when it seems like it
[4:19] doesn't make sense even when it seems
[4:21] like it's just the the worst thing in
[4:23] the world we are to give thanks in all
[4:25] things I think too often times we can
[4:28] get so caught up in the circumstance
[4:31] this is why this has dealt with me so uh
[4:34] so closely lately we can get so caught
[4:37] up in in the details of the trial or the
[4:39] details of the circumstance or even
[4:41] deeper than that my dad and I were
[4:44] talking about this and we can get so
[4:46] caught up in the mind battles that come
[4:48] along with the trial or with the
[4:50] circumstance amen who else gets caught
[4:52] up in that we all get caught up in those
[4:54] things because what goes along with that
[4:57] is that the enemy is trying to to keep
[5:00] you from growing and maturing in that
[5:03] specific area you know he he he put it
[5:06] across God's desk God knew that you were
[5:08] going to have to go through this God God
[5:10] allowed it but you know and I was just
[5:13] thinking about this last night or two
[5:15] nights ago when I was studying for this
[5:17] I can just imagine the Mind battles that
[5:19] Paul was having during this time he
[5:21] sought the Lord three times he wasn't he
[5:23] wasn't uh um you know he went through
[5:27] those same kind of mind battles that you
[5:29] went through he was a man he was subject
[5:31] to those things and I can just imagine
[5:33] some of those those thoughts that the
[5:34] devil was probably probably giving him
[5:36] how can you you know how can you say
[5:39] that Jesus is the Healer of all of your
[5:41] diseases when you're going around you're
[5:43] praying for the sick yet you're
[5:44] suffering this Affliction yourself
[5:46] you've sought the Lord three times does
[5:48] he even answer your prayers these are
[5:50] the kind of mind battles that come along
[5:52] with those things and those are normal
[5:54] when you have those things you are to
[5:56] Glory even more because you know that
[5:58] there is something in this there's
[6:00] something greater in this that God is
[6:01] bringing out you know he probably the
[6:04] devil probably sent thoughts to him you
[6:05] know you persecuted Jesus and and his
[6:07] followers and now you think you're
[6:09] somehow worthy enough to to preach and
[6:12] to pray for the sick and to do these
[6:13] things these are the things that I no
[6:16] doubt were probably going through his
[6:18] mind and he was able to come to this
[6:23] this
[6:24] realization by Revelation that whether
[6:27] or not my physical body is prospering or
[6:30] whether or not my my mental capacity is
[6:33] prospering I'm living in Victory amen
[6:36] and we are to come to that same
[6:38] Revelation whether or not I feel good or
[6:42] whether or not I feel Victorious that is
[6:45] an a factor in the victory I'm living in
[6:48] Victory because I have the mental
[6:50] attitude the right mental attitude
[6:52] toward every promise of God brings it to
[6:53] fast because I have the mental attitude
[6:55] that you know as long as I'm in the will
[6:57] I know that I'm in the will of God and
[6:59] I'm walking exactly where he wants me to
[7:01] do then then I'm walking in Victory amen
[7:04] and that's the Revelation that Paul was
[7:05] able to to have and to come to in my in
[7:08] my strengths you know in anything
[7:11] prosperous in my life the glory to go
[7:14] I'm going to give the glory to God and
[7:15] it's because of him amen and anything
[7:18] that you have that's prospering in your
[7:19] life it's because of God God glor God
[7:22] give God the glory in that and then on
[7:24] the flip side in my weaknesses the glory
[7:27] still goes to God because I know that
[7:29] because of of what Paul teaches that he
[7:31] uses those weaknesses to bring me to a
[7:33] deeper place in him you know he wants
[7:35] you know I look at you got to look at
[7:36] trials like man the Lord wants me to be
[7:38] more mature in my walk with him so glory
[7:40] to God he gave me a trial so somehow I
[7:42] can walk in a greater Victory than I was
[7:44] walking in before amen I he wants me to
[7:46] be more mature he wants me to have a
[7:48] greater understanding of the word he
[7:50] wants me to have a greater Revelation
[7:51] and when you know those things then you
[7:53] can really walk in Victory amen you
[7:55] can't you know if if you're beating
[7:57] yourself up over these things like like
[7:59] you know job had that and they would
[8:00] come to him and they said you something
[8:02] in your life must not be right but job
[8:04] could say with that heart you know I
[8:06] I've walked upright before the Lord I
[8:08] I've had that there's it's not that it's
[8:11] Lord wanted to use that because the next
[8:14] several thousand years he was going to
[8:15] have Believers look at that he was going
[8:17] to have people look at your life and
[8:19] they say How are you getting through
[8:20] what you're getting through how how do
[8:22] you do this or how do you do that we all
[8:24] have situations in our life and we can
[8:26] look at that how are you getting through
[8:27] that it's God I don't know God God it's
[8:30] God's grace in my life he's sufficient
[8:33] I'm going to glory in these things
[8:35] because it's God Amen and I want it to
[8:37] be um you know to be an encouragement to
[8:41] you because and I had sent this to I had
[8:44] saw just it was just a little uh picture
[8:46] about this but the devil isn't leaving
[8:49] you alone for a certain reason am mean
[8:52] there's a reason that that he's not
[8:53] leaving you alone even when you're
[8:55] suffering that trial you know and I
[8:56] think it's sometimes it's just his last
[8:58] ditch effort to hinder the work of God
[9:00] in your life you know he tried to send
[9:02] you this trial the trial didn't work so
[9:03] then he's going to send the Mind battle
[9:05] on top of the trial that's not going to
[9:06] work because we're going to glory in
[9:08] everything that God gives us and we're
[9:09] going to we're going to whether we're
[9:10] prospering physically or not we're going
[9:12] to move forward amen so we're talking
[9:15] about perspective uh we were talking
[9:17] about perspective last week and the
[9:19] correlation that it has to our life in
[9:22] faith um and to our daily walk of faith
[9:25] and we just to go through a couple of
[9:26] things that we went through last week we
[9:28] went through this Con concept of art of
[9:30] what artists call perspective and the
[9:32] definition is the art of drawing solid
[9:36] objects on two-dimensional surfaces so
[9:39] as to give the right impression of their
[9:41] height their width their depth and
[9:43] position in relation to each other when
[9:46] viewed from a particular point so in
[9:48] other words it creates a realistic sense
[9:50] about the image and I wanted to add this
[9:53] it was just what Google's AI generative
[9:55] writes about it a picture without linear
[9:57] perspective is an image where parallel
[10:00] lines do not converge towards a
[10:02] vanishing point meaning objects in the
[10:04] distance do not appear smaller compared
[10:07] to closer objects effectively creating a
[10:09] flattened appearance often seen in
[10:12] Styles like traditional Chinese painting
[10:14] or early medevial art where the focus is
[10:17] on depicting objects as flat planes
[10:20] rather than creating a realistic sense
[10:23] of depth so and one writer writes it
[10:26] like this a perspective allows you to
[10:29] stay there deep into the distance of
[10:31] that painting even though it was drawn
[10:34] on a flat surface and I'm going to give
[10:35] you some examples here um if we could
[10:38] you have that go to the first oh that's
[10:40] the first slide perfect so um I
[10:42] mentioned this last time when I was
[10:44] defining it but I wanted to show some
[10:46] visuals today to help us grasp that the
[10:49] concept so these are these are some
[10:51] images the first image I have here is a
[10:54] picture without linear perspective and
[10:58] what you what you're looking at is they
[11:00] kind of Drew the image on top of another
[11:04] one so there's the three on the one side
[11:06] and three and they're kind of drawn on
[11:07] top and you know you can kind of get
[11:10] visually you can kind of understand that
[11:11] they're supposed to be kind of behind
[11:13] each other but it there's not like a lot
[11:15] of perspective there you can obviously
[11:17] tell you're looking at that and there's
[11:19] not a reality to that image it's it's
[11:21] it's something that's drawn and you're
[11:22] getting you're getting visually what the
[11:24] artist is trying to get get across the
[11:27] the main point but there's no there's no
[11:30] reality there's no depth to it they're
[11:32] drawn on top of the reason uh each other
[11:35] and if you can go to the next one you
[11:37] know um so if you look at this picture
[11:40] this picture has perspective this is a
[11:42] this is a drawing this isn't a physical
[11:45] taken picture but you can look at it and
[11:47] you can see those dis those buildings
[11:49] look like they're in a distance right
[11:51] they're you're look you look like you're
[11:53] looking at a a a real object you're
[11:56] you're the the PE there's people that
[11:58] are close there's people that are far
[12:00] away but that was drawn on a flat image
[12:03] right if you go to the next one there's
[12:04] some cool examples so this is just a a
[12:07] traditional um Chinese so you can see
[12:10] you know they're walking over and uh you
[12:13] know you can see distance you can see
[12:15] close it just it looks real okay if you
[12:18] go to the next
[12:20] one um so you can get this is kind of
[12:23] when it started introducing this is the
[12:25] Christ supper so you can kind of see you
[12:27] know there's they're behind and you can
[12:29] see how you know Jesus is supposed to be
[12:31] in front of that and then there's in the
[12:33] distance mountains and so you can kind
[12:34] of get the the understanding of it and I
[12:36] think there's might be one more which I
[12:39] thought was really cool this one I mean
[12:41] you look like you're looking at a real
[12:43] image I mean you're looking at a reality
[12:46] of something that was drawn they were
[12:47] looking at this and you can kind of see
[12:49] the perspective you can see how this
[12:51] building is closer and so that's what
[12:53] perspective brings in art so another
[12:56] core reason I think that was the last
[12:58] slide you can you can take it down
[13:00] another core reason um for perspective
[13:03] and why artists use it is that it can
[13:06] allow you to see the image from the
[13:09] Viewpoint that the artist intended you
[13:12] to see it from so the Viewpoint so and
[13:14] that's kind of a the core of today what
[13:17] what I'm trying to get across today that
[13:18] it it allows the viewer to see the image
[13:22] or the sculpture or whatever work of art
[13:24] it is from the same field of vision that
[13:28] the art artist got the inspiration for
[13:31] that for that uh piece of art the way
[13:33] that the artist sees it you know often
[13:35] times when something is viewed from a
[13:38] certain angle that we talked about the
[13:40] first Sunday school lesson it can't be
[13:42] fully appreciated but once you get it in
[13:45] the right field of vision it can be
[13:46] altogether different you know it adds
[13:48] Dimension it adds depth and Paul was
[13:52] able to realize that this would give
[13:55] more glory to God than if he were to be
[13:58] healed of this thing you know he sought
[13:59] the Lord but God gave him that that
[14:02] understanding and to look at a scripture
[14:04] like that and and have in in his
[14:08] situation and honestly from a from a
[14:10] sincere heart to be able to say that
[14:14] kind of a thing and to actually glory in
[14:16] in a real circumstance that's going on
[14:19] that shows that there was a real
[14:20] presence of Christ in his life that
[14:22] really shows that you know only God can
[14:24] do something like that um you know and I
[14:28] made this statement last time and I've
[14:30] I've said it multiple times but this
[14:32] concept of of per of linear perspective
[14:35] you know it adds a reality you know a
[14:38] layer of something to the image that it
[14:41] didn't have before and you know sure
[14:43] without without perspective we saw that
[14:45] that first image we got the gist of what
[14:48] what we're looking at or the general
[14:49] concept but when you start adding this
[14:52] mathematical depth to the image it
[14:54] creates something that takes it from
[14:57] being uh for instance something on a
[15:00] page and it creates a reality of it you
[15:03] know you're you're able to look at it
[15:04] you know that's what the Holy Ghost does
[15:06] to our lives you're able to take the
[15:07] words on this page and you're able to to
[15:10] see the reality you're able to truly
[15:12] glory in an infirmity you're able to
[15:14] truly walk in faith and victory you're
[15:16] able to truly understand some of some of
[15:19] what the scripture says only the Holy
[15:21] Ghost can give that kind of a thing and
[15:22] to add the real perspective and depth
[15:25] that God intends for our lives um and he
[15:29] Paul was able to have this whole new
[15:31] layer of perspective and this this just
[15:34] this elevated thought process and he let
[15:36] it shape his whole outlook on the
[15:38] situation you know he let the Lord
[15:40] change his perspective um so many times
[15:45] us Children of Children Of God you know
[15:49] they'll they'll kind of be thinking
[15:51] about what they're going through and
[15:54] they'll want to have you know they'll
[15:56] try to grit their teeth and try to
[15:58] understand
[15:59] but with with getting in all things that
[16:04] you're getting get wisdom so when you're
[16:06] going through what we're going through
[16:08] whatever it is I mean it doesn't have to
[16:09] be some crazy once in a-lifetime trial
[16:12] we go through things every day there's
[16:14] there's small things that we go through
[16:15] that are just small uh footsteps they're
[16:18] small building pieces on our Christian
[16:21] walk and to be able to say Lord how am I
[16:23] going to get my what do you want me to
[16:25] learn from this to be able to have that
[16:26] kind of a an outlook on it and say say
[16:29] well you know take a step back and and
[16:31] try to look at it from a different
[16:33] perspective rather than you know always
[16:35] trying to to grit your teeth and oh this
[16:37] needs to be done or that's where your
[16:40] prayer life comes into play and and you
[16:42] you able to you able to say God help me
[16:45] to learn from this situation I want to
[16:48] be able to have that kind of that kind
[16:49] of attitude so that when I'm faced with
[16:51] any situation you know I can take a step
[16:54] back and this is what Paul did he took a
[16:55] step back and he realized that this was
[16:57] a part of the arst
[16:59] process you know when you're when you're
[17:02] drawing a masterpiece I've never drawn
[17:04] one but when the when an artist is
[17:06] drawing a masterpiece and they began to
[17:08] add layers of depth to it you know that
[17:11] perspective that we talked about it
[17:12] doesn't always look so pretty at first
[17:14] you know there's a there's a process and
[17:17] sometimes the only one who can who can
[17:19] actually see what's going to be the
[17:21] final product of it is the artists
[17:24] themselves the final the final work the
[17:27] only one who may be able to see it is
[17:30] the artist until it's finished but if
[17:32] you give it time and you let the artist
[17:35] finish what he had in mind to do and to
[17:38] fulfill his image uh that he had in his
[17:40] mind it's all going to be worth it you
[17:43] know and God it's all going to be worth
[17:44] it because God's God's the greatest
[17:46] artist that ever lived you know he's the
[17:48] greatest thing he he knows all things
[17:51] amen and so he has an image for you and
[17:54] he has an image for me and sometimes it
[17:56] doesn't always look exactly how it how
[17:58] how we think it should look but he's got
[18:01] he's got it all in control um and
[18:03] sometimes our eyes only really scratch
[18:05] the surface of that image but we know
[18:10] the end and we know it's going to be a
[18:11] masterpiece right I wanted to get into a
[18:13] quote this morning um I wasn't able to
[18:16] get to last week brother bandam says in
[18:19] uh let's see what sermon is this um
[18:28] I think it's 1963 I think it's um Christ
[18:32] is the mystery I have it written down in
[18:35] another note but if you if you need it
[18:37] get with me um that puts me in mind of a
[18:39] Greek artist I seen one time in an
[18:41] ancient Cathedral showing that Adam and
[18:43] Eve looked like they looked like beasts
[18:44] or something and that's what the carnal
[18:46] mind can perceive of some spiritual
[18:48] thing I think Adam was the most handsome
[18:51] man that ever lived and Eve was a
[18:52] perfect woman in every way now carnal
[18:54] Minds wrap up the thing in their own
[18:56] ideas then God sends down and unfolds
[18:59] The Thing by his power and that's
[19:01] exactly what took place there in the
[19:04] days of Ahab so what he's saying is is
[19:07] you know sometimes we perceive things to
[19:09] be a certain way we wrap it up in our
[19:11] own idea but then God sends down the
[19:14] power and sends down and unfolds the
[19:17] thing he uncovers the secret mystery to
[19:20] it and the most incredible thing about
[19:22] the God that we serve is is that he was
[19:25] the first intelligence right we have
[19:27] this artificial intelligence now he was
[19:29] the first intelligence and that
[19:32] artificial intelligence that we're that
[19:33] are that we've been tapping into for a
[19:35] long time but you know that especially
[19:38] now it's it's mindblowing you can create
[19:41] images and videos that that look so real
[19:46] with nothing more than a single sentence
[19:49] or or certain words and what's so crazy
[19:53] about it too is that even in the name
[19:56] itself artificial intelligence it it
[19:59] lacks it it lacks something you know
[20:01] it's an an it's an element that that it
[20:04] can never possess and that is life amen
[20:06] I had this uh patient coming in to to
[20:09] the clinic probably a month or two ago
[20:11] and they're from overseas and I think it
[20:13] was Denmark somewhere in Denmark or or
[20:16] um one of those smaller European
[20:18] countries Sweden maybe and they're
[20:21] incorporating AI into a lot of their
[20:25] business models and a lot of even like
[20:28] communicators and they're starting to
[20:31] have to write laws because people think
[20:33] they're talking to other people but
[20:36] they're not they're talking to
[20:37] artificial intelligence so they're
[20:39] having to incorporate these laws and
[20:41] it's I mean it's in crazy it's it's
[20:43] incredible that they're even having to
[20:44] write those laws but what it doesn't
[20:46] possess you know you can um you know the
[20:49] this development of AI you know it's
[20:50] going to make I think it's going to make
[20:52] really great strides for science and
[20:54] medicine in the years to come until the
[20:57] Lord comes for for us but it will never
[20:59] possess that depth of real life it will
[21:02] never you know talking about angles and
[21:05] perspective um to possess that real life
[21:10] there's just there's something there's
[21:11] something different about it you know
[21:13] and even even though AI is far more
[21:16] intelligent than I could ever be or than
[21:19] we could ever be all it has to look at
[21:22] or feed on is information it has details
[21:24] or statistics or patterns but just as
[21:27] Pastor has been dealing so heavily in
[21:29] that in that series the last several
[21:31] months Faith Works outside of that realm
[21:34] it works outside of information it works
[21:36] outside of patterns it works outside of
[21:38] Statistics Faith Works and operates in a
[21:41] different realm than that and even when
[21:43] technology has now Advanced to the point
[21:46] of capturing images with the megapixels
[21:49] and allowing us to to take a moment and
[21:52] almost hold it forever you know that's
[21:54] what a picture does you take a moment
[21:56] and it's almost like you're holding it
[21:57] forever even in the progression of that
[21:59] kind of Technology you know that the
[22:01] camera that it evolved from art it's
[22:03] still just an image that you can look at
[22:05] and that you can appreciate it's not
[22:08] something tangible it's not it's not
[22:10] right now it's not reality but faith is
[22:13] right now Faith is the realist reality
[22:16] human perception and what brother random
[22:18] was was getting at human perception
[22:20] versus Christ reality Pastor made this
[22:23] statement several weeks ago I'm just
[22:25] paraphrasing but it went something like
[22:26] this the reality of Christ is more than
[22:30] our P more real than our P perception on
[22:34] any matter the reality want say that
[22:36] again the reality of Christ is more real
[22:39] than our perception on any matter and
[22:41] that's what faith is that that statement
[22:43] struck me because you know our kind our
[22:46] carnal Minds just like what brother
[22:47] Brenham said our carnal Minds wrap up
[22:49] things and we put our own ideas around
[22:51] it and sometimes it's just common sense
[22:53] you know if if you've got common sense
[22:55] not everybody does but when you have
[22:56] common sense sometimes you know we have
[22:59] this this portion you know of you know
[23:02] in order of of function in in everyday
[23:04] Society but that's not where Faith
[23:06] operates right our mind is limited our
[23:10] our human carnal mind is limited to the
[23:13] constructs of our senses and we know
[23:15] that and and our then conscience and
[23:18] reason but that's you know and that's an
[23:20] elementary concept but faith is
[23:22] something that that transcends our
[23:25] understanding of what a reality is it's
[23:27] when God step in and shows us The
[23:30] Heavenly perspective on the matter amen
[23:33] he unfolds the realer if I could say it
[23:36] like that reality of what is happening
[23:39] that's what faith is supposed to do in
[23:41] our lives it's supposed to add
[23:43] perspective but it's it takes it further
[23:46] than just adding perspective it adds a
[23:48] new reality A New Perspective to that
[23:51] amen and that that Pastor uh that
[23:54] statement Pastor made
[23:56] um I think it was in that same same
[23:58] sermon he says the devil gets you to
[24:00] accept your reasoning you know when
[24:01] Peter went to go and and transcend that
[24:03] law of nature by operating the realm
[24:06] that Jesus meant for him to be in what
[24:08] he was doing when he was walking on
[24:10] water is he was operating in that Faith
[24:12] realm but what the devil and this is
[24:15] this is what he was saying is what the
[24:16] devil got him to do is to operate in his
[24:18] human realm right he took that Faith
[24:21] aspect away he started operating in a
[24:23] common sense realm this is water I by
[24:26] the laws of physics I should sink but
[24:29] for a moment in time he wasn't he was
[24:31] operating in the realm that Jesus
[24:33] intended for him to be operating
[24:36] in and the greatest artist that was to
[24:39] ever live made that picture in his life
[24:42] that picture of fear have more depth to
[24:46] it he was scared but but the the
[24:48] greatest artist ever live knew that
[24:50] there was a greater perspective that
[24:51] could be had in that moment and so he
[24:53] showed that to Peter he showed that
[24:56] there was more depth to this particular
[24:58] he took that two-dimensional time in his
[25:00] life and he he added a dimension to it
[25:03] he added it made it a third dimension
[25:05] and you know and I believe you know he
[25:08] he knew and we said this last time that
[25:10] that was that he was just showing Peter
[25:12] he knew Peter would eventually operate
[25:15] so confidently in that realm after he
[25:17] received the Holy Ghost and you know
[25:19] last time we talked about our trials and
[25:22] how God uses those very situations to
[25:25] get us to operate our faith in those
[25:28] things you know God will allow things in
[25:30] our life because and I was I had this um
[25:33] I don't know if I brought it here but I
[25:35] brought it to uh I think brother Blue's
[25:37] church but when um J Jas and his and and
[25:43] his daughter had died he was being
[25:45] driven to his Perfection he was always
[25:48] brother bam talks about that he was a
[25:49] secret believer but then his daughter
[25:52] passed away and died and that was when
[25:56] the reality of Christ came to fruition
[25:58] in his life because God Jesus I believe
[26:01] Jesus was trying to get him to to to to
[26:03] a new a new place in Christ he was
[26:05] trying to show him that this is who I am
[26:07] he was always a Believer and sometimes
[26:08] that's what trials do in our life God is
[26:10] trying to get you to a new place he's
[26:12] trying to trying to allely to see I want
[26:14] to be greater in your life I want I want
[26:16] more I want more of your
[26:20] heart I don't believe that the Lord I
[26:22] got to wrap up here I don't believe the
[26:24] Lord wants us to live shallow Christian
[26:26] lives and have just a form of godliness
[26:29] you know living right and acting right
[26:31] those things are good going to church
[26:32] those are good just having a prayer life
[26:34] those things are good but not having any
[26:37] kind of demonstration of Faith or power
[26:39] in our life I believe God wants us to to
[26:42] have those things you know adding Faith
[26:45] a faith perspective to it you know that
[26:47] depth I want that depth in my life I
[26:48] don't want I don't want my reasoning I
[26:50] don't want I I don't want to come to my
[26:53] senses if my senses are going to make me
[26:55] sink then I don't want to come to my
[26:56] senses in a situation like what Pastor
[26:58] said I want to walk on that water amen
[27:00] and I want to I want to live in Victory
[27:02] and if that means walking on water When
[27:04] God says I can then that's exactly what
[27:07] I want to do you know and the devil's
[27:09] objective is to keep get you to keep you
[27:12] focused on either your perspective on
[27:15] the matter or his perspective on the
[27:16] matter you know it's and that's going to
[27:19] keep you in a faith a surface level
[27:22] Faith with no depth it'll keep you from
[27:24] Victory um so I just want us in myose
[27:28] cling comments this morning um when
[27:30] you're battling something take these
[27:32] scriptures and bring them to mind and
[27:35] let let the word help you gain depth and
[27:38] gain perspective in whatever it is
[27:41] whatever situation that you're in
[27:42] whatever you're praying about whatever
[27:44] whatever it is let the Lord you know
[27:46] some step away from your mind's narrow
[27:48] perspective because that's what it is
[27:49] our minds have a narrow perspective
[27:51] especially when you're in a situation
[27:53] that you feel like it's a trial or
[27:55] something we have a narrow perspective
[27:57] step away from that and allow your allow
[28:00] the Lord allow a Heavenly perspective to
[28:02] come and show you exactly what it is
[28:06] that and I have some more I guess we'll
[28:07] get to it another time Heavenly Father
[28:09] Lord we love you so much and we thank
[28:10] you for this day Lord we thank you for
[28:12] your word I pray you just be with Pastor
[28:14] today as he brings us the word father
[28:16] may it anoint him Lord anoint our ears
[28:17] to hear what you have to say we love you
[28:19] we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless
[28:21] you
