today several families actually devil battling them william how's your mom that didn't get back on the list today okay all right let's keep praying for you amen sister connie there suffering devil attacking her and i was reminded of that as i saw william here this morning also brother brad sending up an additional request now you ready you're ready to be glad that you're sitting here in a nice warm safe in american church brother brad and sister sarah woke up this morning to gun fire right outside of their hotel and so it was quite alarming there for a few minutes and uh but you know i i thought i didn't want to get tied into a conversation but i i thought that i'd like to tell him brother brad as long as you're in the will of god you're immortal man amen the devil cannot stop amen god's plan amen god bless you revelation chapter 17 this morning and those we had so many prayer requests please just keep those in mind um people write in those prayer requests because they have confidence in prayer and we certainly have confidence in prayer don't you have confidence in prayer my prayer people say prayer changes things i some years ago i started saying prayer changes everything i mean when you start when you realize the position that the bride of christ holds in the earth say what position is that the word made flesh and the earth again same way it was embodied in a the only difference is in jesus it was a single body walking the shores of galilee but god never intended to stay bottled up in one body walking the source of galilee his whole plan was to send to to come back into his body again in the earth and walk among a many-membered bride are you part of that number today amen praise the lord we want to continue part nine today uh in our series on the seven vows of revelation revelation 17 and we'll catch these first two verses and there came one of the seven angels which had the seventh seven vials now this would be the same this angel is synonymous with the angel of revelation 10 7. the revel uh the the same angel in revelation 3 to the laodicean church age all right so 3 14 10 7 um the the met the revelation 5 the strong angel standing there calling for a mighty come for someone worthy here he is again the seventh angel holding this seventh vial because he's the one who brings the full mystery of god back to the earth there came one of the seven angels with which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither i will show unto thee the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters so i mean when you hear what he's going to show who do you imagine it is it's certainly the seventh angel given the open book and the mystery the un the unfolding of the seals all right and this is the very thing that brother branham and his ministry identified he identified this great that set upon many waters verse 2 with whom the kings of the earth now catch it now because this is part remember now we're teaching on the the impact of the vials pre-tribulation all right where they're partially impacting the earth when i look at the history and i see what the partial impact has done to the world today when i see the insanity released into the air under the seventh vial and what it's had an effect on the world today and it's just partial friends you don't want to be here in the tribulation because then it's full so now notice what he noticed now he's coming to identify this beast's system and he says come hither i will show unto thee the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters now look at the warning with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication so this is all the leadership of the world have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication all right so now we we when you when you think about what brings the oil and the wine to the to the new testament church it was god's holy spirit revealing a word that brought a stimulation upon the people and it caused us to not only hear and recognize the word but it caused us to act upon the word amen so now this is why brother branham would talk about fornication remember in the book of revelation fornication and adultery is primarily the fornication against the word as calling jesus your husband and you've taken a man-made system and the whole world has been duped into believing that man-made system and because that he has believed that false word then now he's under a stimulation he's drinking a wine that is corrupting his mind and placing him in a stupor placing him in an insanity and it all came from following feeding on discrepancies in the word of god now how glad are you for a message you'd be drunk you'd be drunk with them that's why paul said to the thessalonians we're we're sober we're of the day we're not drunken in the night as the world see so this is all tying together i want to draw that picture in your mind as we go to the our next reading right go a chapter over to chapter 18 verse 1. and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lighted with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies and i heard another voice from voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities amen amen let's pray father we thank you for your word this morning i thank you for the unveiling of these great mysteries to us i thank you for the anointing and the unction of the holy spirit already that i see operating this morning i commit myself further now into your hands for these things these are vital times lord tremendous hour and perilous times on the earth and we must we must see you in your movements we must hear the rhythm and time of the sheep music we must be in the spirit of the composer lord we can't be out of step we've got to be in step father i pray that you'll grant it to us now this is necessary if we hope to if we hope that our lives are a reflection of shalom lord there's only two spirits anointing the world shalom and insanity father we want the peace of god that passes all understanding may you grant it to us may your presence now be in our midst show yourself alive and mighty lord by breaking down your word and let it let it be quickened to the hearts of the people we commit it to you today in jesus name amen god bless you you can be seated so um brother matthew if you will put 18 3 back up for me please on the screen and then we'll go from there i want to make some comments and then we'll make some comments on the fourth verse as well so you know when we when we see all of these connections and i i trust that your minds are sharp today to see all of these connections thank you for the kenny to see all of these connections because these things aren't accidents when the lord is connecting the dots like this for us uh it really it amazes us it astonishes us but it's not it's not there just to amaze you and just to so so it can make us all smarter and go wow i see all these mysteries i connect all of these you know in school we used to get these things where you had to connect the dots to make the picture and it's you know it's it's not just about uh having a picture it's there's a journey connecting the dots and you're on a journey today and you know as you start to get those dots connected more and more the picture starts coming clear suddenly the more you learn the more you know what it should look like which then in turn helps guide you to make the rest of the connections and this is what the journey i want to speak about that a little bit more today this journey i was listening on our on our call in show yesterday brother brother uh david samuel my goodness what a what a lesson he taught us and i have some notes and outlines some i want to make a few comments and repeat a few things he said because it was so conducive to what i want to teach today but we find that you know when you when you start looking at this scripture for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth have waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies now you know when you when you look at it that way it then it's it's not very hard to understand why the world runs after it because they're waxing rich it's what you know as what brother branham said if you really want to be a success in the world he said one time to young men he said if you young men want to be a a worldly heartthrob you know and and and that's the that's your goal he said then then you better not follow this he said you know if you want to be a success by the world's standards you better just go the way of the world because one thing's for sure this won't make you popular and this will make you a target of the enemy and he'll attack your health he'll attack your finances he's the god of economics he's not going to let it go good for you see and he's going to attack your home your family but i just say look uh we're going to have to fight and i'd rather fight on the winning side i'd rather fight on the side that i that that fights for something noble i'd i'd rather i'd rather give my life i'd rather go down and defeat defending the right than survive defending the wrong and so you know when we begin to look at it how that go up to verse 2 brother matt sorry verse 2 and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen it's fallen and it's become the habitation of devils and a hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird now we've now leave that right there we've shown you how that babylon this is really a spirit yeah it manifested itself in history just like the the plagues that come out of the vials it you know it's it's actually had a manifestation in history and you can we've actually in our series been able to go back and tie relevant historical events you know and and we didn't get them all because because the early parts of the vials are ambiguous and unclear to us i think moses and elijah will know exactly what every one of them were when they go to the jews but we find that the prophet did give us the ones that were relevant to us we understand how that how the how that that fourth trumpet and fourth vial and fifth trumpet and fifth file and six trumpet and six file and seven and seven how they begin churning as the 20th century approached and and god's going to start it all in and pick up the woes and the churches the church is going to have an effect and the politics are going to have an effect and these things aren't accidents to me that when the world looks at the world and the tragedies that have befallen it yes to us we're not numb to that we don't say oh well it just all had to be in in whatever whatever no we lament the loss of life we lament that babies died we lament the terrible wars and the terrible plagues but you know i i but at the same time i'm i'm i'm ready to remind mankind you chose this path this is the cruelty of sin that not only did you choose in genesis you've been choosing it down through history you're still choosing it today they will not god sent the greatest message the world has seen since the days of christ in the early church and the same way they rejected jesus then they reject jesus now the same way they rejected his church then they reject it now so you know man cannot it is it is illegitimate of man to blame god for the horrors of the world god is trying everything he can to save man even save him from his own self man seems hell-bent and determined to end up in destruction and we're gonna i don't want to get ahead of myself i'm being very careful i want to be very very studious today because i want to make these points uh slowly and i'll get to preaching between them that's the way i've decided to go with it today and so so when we when we look at how they've committed fornication and it and babylon the great is fallen cried with a mighty voice strong voice saying babylon the greatest fallen has fallen we showed you babylon in the beginning of the bible under ancient babylon under nimrod babylon in the middle of the bible under nebuchadnezzar and babylon at the end time our day only now it's called mystery babylon and it's a mystery to the world and that's why they fall for it i'm thankful that i've been brought into the mystery and it's no longer confusing to me a mystery is only mysterious when you're on the outside once you've been brought into the mystery once you've come into the fellowship that's why paul said you've been called under this gathering and paul says that several times in scripture you you've been called to a gathering it's a gathering around the word of god it's a gathering around the re the revelation of the hour to bring you into the right mental state to bring you into the mind of christ so that you become impervious to the deception of the world and that's really what this age is called to overcome your calling and your election is made sure unto you because you have overcome the deception of the hour all right that's what that's the burden that's upon us we must overcome the deception of the hour and then and then from there god will take care of every last other single detail about it he'll have you perfected don't you worry he'll have you ready amen so we find then that that this whole idea how that it could be this whole thing of fornication and how that people could say wow you know that's that's sexual misconduct well remember that that a deed is only the manifestation of a thought not brought subject to god so first it had to be a thought see and so just like that's why the bible says you bring every thought that's contrary to god's word anything that's sinful evil or ungodly is contrary to god's word anything that reasons god's word or doubts god's word you're to bring that subject you're to capture it in your mind but if you don't capture it in your mind it'll become a deed see and you capture it in your mind and you take it to the holy spirit in prayer and the holy ghost will quash it immediately and so so we cast down vain imaginations and anything that exalts itself like telling you oh that's a little thin sin it doesn't really matter a whole lot that's a thought that's exalting itself against the word of god see so so you so we find then that that the world has a hard time reckoning when we when they read in their bible about fornication and we come along and say that's false teaching and they go false teaching but it says fornication right but remember it's a spirit and the first act of fornication in genesis was not the act between eve and the serpent the first fornication was when satan misinterpreted god's word and he felt for it and brother branham says when she believed his lie then she received his l-i-f-e amen so you you realize then that the world is found to be an adulterous woman this is why the bible calls the great and her daughter's harlots it's not because they're all having sex orgies it's because they have a they're they're having a fornicating spirit against the seed of christ and his seed is his word and when you deny his word that's fornication with the world which proves i mean what you're reading here in genesis i'm sorry in revelation proves the serpent's seed in genesis it proves what that was all about see that the act the physical act only was a was a consequence of the spiritual act that preceded it so then today friends how are you going to be found virgins in christ because you have believed the word you have like mary said i hear the word i don't understand it all i can't figure out how it's going to be to me it looks impossible but you said it i believe it amen so be it unto me and that is the pattern of the bride of christ through millennia amen it's never not been that way see she's always believed that's been her identifying mark a virtuous woman that's always been her identifying mark is that is that she remains faithful see to to receive only the seat of her husband which is which in this case is god and and or christ so whether it's old testament new testament that was always the sin that that brought about the deeds all right now so when we when we find that he says here in in in verse 2 that it's become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird now it's hard to comprehend how that how how that something that started so small and seemed so innocent in matthew 13 how that that could could become what we read here that it's because in matthew 13 it was simply uh it was simply a a a a a mustard seed that grew into a he said the kingdom of heaven is like a man who planted a mustard seed which is the smallest and it started out as planting a mustard seed but then that mustard seed and here's where people miss it they don't realize seeds grow it doesn't stay a small thing one little seed of discrepancy against god's word will grow into something that will pollute your mind your soul your family your loved ones whole churches have been swept aside and put on a shelf by god unable to use them effectively anymore because they ran out on what looked like a little innocent seed but when but see this seed grew into a plant and then it grew into a tree and then the third stage was fowls of the air came and lodged in the branches and you don't really it's and even in in matthew 13 because matthew 13 is the seven church ages has them all perfectly you you find that that by the time revelation identifies that little bitty tree that started out as a tiny seed grown to a plant and grown to a tree and birds landed and lodged in it you find by the time you get to the book of revelation that that seed small so small had perverted and became a hold of every fowl spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird that's the false church so you wonder how can they do what they do in the name of christ because it's a hold of foul spirits you wonder why there's such a thing as christian rock amen because it's a cage of unclean and hateful birds you wonder why you can see pentecostal charismatic worship services and it's nothing but they're back in the clubs and they've even got all the lights and all the booms and everybody's jumping and dancing and and and it's and they're and they're pretending to worship god and actually believe they are and they are worshiping a god just not the right one say how have they come to that brother branham warned pentecost that that would happen he said if you don't turn is what he told them in the 60s if you don't come back to the word of god in 50 years you'll be worse than the catholic church and they are you'll have a more of a decent service going to a catholic mass than you will to some of these charismatic church services i don't recommend you take the mass i'm just saying you'll have a you'll have more of a decency in the air and more of a respect than you'll see in some of these so-called church services of today how's that become possible because it became a hold of every foul spirit and the cage of every unclean bird verse three for all nations have drunk over the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies verse 4 and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people notice it's my people so even in a perverted world god has people that ye be not partakers of her sins so that so you're different see and that you and that ye receive not of her plagues and so brother branham makes this statement why i'm against organized religion everybody always wondered william branham you know why are you always rocking the boat why are you always against things why are you always criticizing our organizations so brother branham preaches two sermons why we are not a denomination and why i'm against you've asked the question i'm going to give you an answer why i'm against organized religion he says look immediately after her mystery was made known who she was what she was who her daughters was the see watch see who her daughters was the mystery has been made known then god sent an angel a messenger to what call out the message of the hour see so the message of the hour came to identify that's why revelation 17 when it opens up with an angel having having one of the seven vials it's obviously the seventh because of it what he's what he's gonna do he's going to identify the system and call it out and identify her harlot daughters and identify it as death and he's gonna come out of her my people see so clearly the messenger of the last day you will notice that he has an identifying message because he must be able to identify the antichrist system and his deeds he's got to be able you know to discern the secrets uh and past sins of that horse system that only a prophet could do no one could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart of lucifer except a prophet and lucifer held that close but one day isaiah stood up and said i'm going to reveal to the whole world satan you should have stayed out of my prayer line i'm about to tell the whole world i'm going to discern the very thoughts and secrets of your heart now i'm going to write it in a book and tell the whole world about it here's what you did here's how this whole thing got started back in the eternities you were fine you were perfect in all your ways until iniquity was found in you because you had an eye disease you said i will ascend i will be like god i will set up my kingdom see and this and that and that became the first signs of an antichrist spirit and started a war in heaven which of course then uh which as we know spilled over into the earth all right now let me keep moving so for all nations okay uh verse 5 for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities so now all things then are being driven by the word of god do you accept that today the pure word you know and but now watch so so now we've established in the and i've taken my first 15 or 20 minutes to establish that what you see happening why you have a people who are who are chastened and virgins of christ in the earth who are living apart from the world who don't suffer from the madness of the seventh vial aren't you glad your mind is already sealed from the effects of the seventh vial you've already passed from death unto life and you are impervious to the insanity of the world oh we ought to just rejoice in that alone i'm impervious to the insanity of the world see so you say well but i got all kinds of failures but you have believed the message you have understood it you have received it and you have desired it from your whole heart which is why you lament your weaknesses you ever think about that it proves that you don't want to do those things or else why did you repent it proves something has happened on the inside of you friends your failure doesn't mean you're not a son of god your failure means that you repent of it and that shows the real desire of your heart you never wanted to do that in the first place oh i've rejoiced in that i've gained freedom so many times the devil tried to mock me and i just remind them of that and i go away with my hands up in victory every time because i believe the word of this hour and i see it and i crave it and i long for it it's changed my whole life change my whole heart change my whole perspective i'm not the same person i used to be see there's a difference between repenting because you don't want to go to hell and repenting because that's just not you anymore you don't ever want to be like that see so we find then that there is a pure word that has been delivered by god for his family and that's in the earth and that's a seed and if you if you feed on it it'll grow amen so we have the pure word of god delivered by the holy spirit for his family we also have the seeds of discrepancy for the uh from the antichrist for the world so if the world you know if if they would if they could grasp in their minds that the word of the antichrist is literally transforming people the the madness that you see is because they're being changed into the things they gaze at and the things they hear is a seed that's planted in their heart they don't bring it they don't they won't repent of the thought and it becomes a deed and that's what you're seeing on the streets today in every facet of society it doesn't matter whether you want to talk about politics or the ecumenical system or the education system the realms of science the realms of technology doesn't matter the tree of knowledge of good and evil people are making their choice and it's it's it's they're literally being conformed to the world they're being conformed to a false word and paul says to you don't be conformed but be transformed because listen friends if an anti-word is is polluting the world and bringing insanity and you can see it do i have to convince you it's crazy do i have to convince you it's perverted you can see it i can see it we all see it it's a reality that's not a metaphor we live with that every day but i'm here to tell you if that anti-word can produce that in people then surely a real word can produce the word of god in our lives see brother david samuel was talking about the whole concept of of you know satan talking about how that he's a thief and then of course god comes christ comes as a thief so this whole thing about a thief and you know he made this point i just thought it was so brilliant of how is it now we're gonna really i'm probably going to give you in what it what would be in my mind the greatest effect of the insanity say oh it's the perversion and it's the gender identity no that's that's pretty bad but i'm going to actually show you an even greater level of insanity say goodness gracious how much worse can it get i you know i just i think this is going to help you not to think about something that's coming but to become cognizant that it's here now and it's happening all around you every day of your life this is why we come to church this is why we read the bible this is why we pray this is why we hear tapes it's why we have live ministry see it's what paul talked about you're you're coming together gather to christ gather to the word it's necessary you need it see so so then so then here's the insanity how is it that the lord can actually come as a thief when he's already given away all the secrets he's already told everything he he he's laid out his total plan to the whole world of how everything will go he wrote it in a bible he sent a prophet to translate it interpret it and point this and make modern events clear by prophecy how's he going to come as a thief when he's already laid out the total plan of how everything it will go when when he will come the the the signs that will be seen openly not in a corner but around the world seven times i mean he already showed when he would come he would come in the last age he would send a message to redeem a pride he would open up the mysteries and be united with his bride and the and the end result would be the spirit of the bride speaking in a unified voice saying come he's already told how he would do it through seven ages how he would send seven angels seven stars in his right hand he proved it down through history nobody could contend with william branham's historical selections because their life proved they were that angel their message proved it he sends the seventh one and it's been proven proven proven proven unmistakably so people have to be willfully blind to look the other way see he showed everything it has happened just exactly in every detail as he promised how he will come in the form of his word through a prophet with a supernatural ministry how he would call out a bride from all the systems of man and and so so then that then that begs the question how does the world end up in a tribulation and judgment i mean my goodness when god so clearly identified the source of the antichrist when god has so clearly taught it out of the scriptures manifested it by signs and wonders the the likes of which you take every other ministry on the field during the days all of his peers if you put all of the ministries on the field in the days of william branham and you combined all of their miracles and all of their of their supernatural power it would not begin to even come close to matching what god did in one kentucky hillbilly how does the world how when god would so clearly identify the truth and so clearly identify the antichrist scheme how he would deceive the nations by a false light how he would lead the world into perversion of the word and then and then when fed upon would lead minds to being poisoned and through science and through technology and beauty that would grow exponentially and it would it would start to permeate all facets of our life and it would literally just begin to move through society and it all started with a little perverted word and it and it and it took over pulpits which then took over holmes which then broke motherhood the backbone of the nation which then moved into politics which moved into the courts which moved into science which moved into all forms of education which then ramped up the entertainment industry which then ramped up everything else and then in craft and commerce and the whole thing has become global and the whole thing has twisted it upside down and perverted inside out and nasty and filthy and when god showed it what happened how it happened why it happened how to escape it and the world and almost in almost the entire majority of the world millions will go we are will will be a fighter for an atomic age that's right amen now you want to talk about insanity so i said to you that's a far greater level of insanity people who miss the rapture will do so because they're insane because it's been made too clear it's been made too plain see how that he goes on to describe the antichrist system how that the antichrist would the bible is so clear see you know especially young young people as you study the word of god and you're taught the word of god by your parents and your sunday school teachers and and uh and and and the at the youth meetings you just remember that that this word that we believe and i'm not just talking about god sending a prophet i'm talking about everything we believe is so clear and so provable in the scriptures that it's incontrovertible and can't be confounded using this book i have challenged that openly around the world and have proved it i've stood face to face with doctors of divinity and phds and lld's and some of the most rudimentary things that we understand and how the bible all begins to connect and it absolutely leaves them without any solution or answer and they're finally just put to complete silence say brother jason does that make you anything it doesn't make me anything i was a dummy and a sinner but god loved me and saved me and sat me down in front of this book when i was a young man and i've been studying it my whole life and i went through those tapes and i compared them to the bible and i listened to the tape and i compared it to the bible and it fits it fits it fits it fits it fits and then i look out in the world and it fits and it fits and it fits and it fits and then i look in my life and it fits and it fits and it fits and it fits i'm here to tell you we have not followed cunningly devised tales hallelujah this is life-giving life-changing word that god has brought in this hour and so it told how the antichrist would take over the old world and that it would become mystery babylon and and then finally how that by the time you get to revelation 13 that it's crossed the ocean now it's across the pond and now it's coming to ameri into the americas and it rises up out of the land not out of the sea it comes now to to this nation to to to finish his complete takeover of the world the bible tells us prophecy tells us the message shows us in the scriptures how that he would consolidate his control once he once he came across and got the western world he now he's not the old one now it's not the beast that was rose up out of the water that had a deadly wound but was healed now it's a beast rising up in chapter 13 the number of america and now it's a and now he's got both sides he's got east and west and now satan's in the driver's seat you see friends he's following christ because just like the the red horse goes out and the lion goes out to me or the white horse the land goes out to meet him and then and then you find the red horse goes and the ox goes out and then the black horse and then a man goes out and then a pale horse and then a flying eagle and it's this warfare that's been going on and as the lightning came out of the east to the west so has the antichrist come from the east to the west that's not an accident see once he had the western powers of the americas then he would begin through the early part of the 20th century to consolidate his control of the world through leagues of nations through unitings of nations and and and global and control of global commerce and global craft and everything is known so so then how is he how is it satan can be a thief how is he stealing from people when when state has been so identified if if a thief was trying to break into your home and i walked up to your front door he's trying to break in and i tap himself excuse me and i knock on your door and get you out of bed and bring in the door and say say brother mark this guy's trying to break into your house you think the guy's going to be able to brother is going to go okay all right well anyway you know that thief's not going to get in his house brother mark's got women to defend that he's going to find a rude awakening trying to come into that house how is it that satan is a thief when a prophet has so identified him when the word is so identified he went out everything it said in the world does that does that does that impact your minds at all today see how is it that the world could be duped by the antichrist and miss the real thing and the only logical answer is is the world is asleep and when you're you know the the we we read from the scriptures that that that they have blinded themselves that's prophecy the bible says their eyes they have closed their ears they have stopped lest at any time the glorious light of the gospel should come and they should see it and hear it and be converted and i would heal them see so now god is showing his intention if they would just believe it th this is god's showing mercy like he did to cain if you'll just do as your brother i'll make a way for you see god's trying to give everybody a legitimate shot to save themselves but he says your eyes you have closed and you will not come to me jesus said you won't come to me that you may receive life why why will you die see and so there we find they're asleep they have they have blinded themselves and closed their own ears mankind chose the path of rejecting god's word and every age from genesis to now i think that's pretty clear i don't think that can be denied unless you're insane so now now that he's done that and and i mean a rudimentary look at history will show that he's done that i mean that's what wars and rumors of wars are all about that's what pestilence and plagues and things are all about mankind eating from the tree of knowledge has destroyed himself that many of the plagues that they have even to this day ebola and marburg and all these different kinds of lethal viruses they found that they were in the jungles naturally and they cleared all the rain forest and cut down all the jungles because of progress and they ended up moving those things into a different state that released them as a viral uh pathogen and and it and it and it literally people breathe it in and it becomes a virus down on the inside of them that liquefies their organs and they die of most horrible death see and brother branham says the more he eats from the tree of knowledge the more death is associated with it that's undeniable that's undeniable the more knowledge the more death say yeah but there's a lot of good well sure it's a tree of knowledge of good and evil that's the whole point but you're going to get one with the other i want to treat a life that has no death associated at all i'm looking for a world that won't need science and technology brother branham said i'll have no education at all and then he turns right around he says it'll be an education so far superior to this man-made understanding won't even be comparable see so now that he's done that and he's spent 6 000 years since eden rejecting the word of god rejecting god in every age from genesis to now now now he arrives at the seventh vial now he's got a problem because the seventh vial starts with a plague released into the air driving the insanity to levels on before unknown before and that's why we can look and and say just in our short lifetime just in my short lifetime i can just look back halfway just halfway through my short life and look at what from there to here and it's almost unrecognizable what the the minds of men have come to and you know we were brother um already was talking here about uh about the some of the european and this is true i've experienced the same thing you know they they've been taught so long this gender identity thing that when they see perverted uh relationships homosexual relationships over in some of those scandinavian countries and european countries kids have been taught that so long in school since kindergarten that to them it's absolutely nothing and they're all they're actually shocked that like you have a problem with that are you like weird and they're not it's not a religious devil it's that they've literally been brainwashed for decades we're just now starting to get it because it that the perversion keeps coming in this way you understand and so that's the agenda to to show that the that the antichrist the antichrist has always wanted to portray himself as the god worthy of worship see that he's always wanted to have a kingdom like christ and so we find that now he comes to the seventh age the seventh vial the seventh seal and now insanity is being released on an insane age get it insanity is now being released tribulation insanity is being released on an already insane age satan has control of all the channels now all the agendas he's filling the air with the plague under the seventh vial you need to be aware of that friends he's literally he's controlling all channels he's controlling all agendas doesn't matter which part of the society fabric of society you want to talk about politics religion science education whatever entertainment pick a topic doesn't matter prophecy speaks to it he has control of all channels all agendas he's filling the air with the plague under the seventh vial and i mean he's got control and hey you you conservatives hold on to your seat for a minute he controls both sides i'm sorry he's he's either a republican or a democrat amen and people say oh there's a pandemic oh it's a plan gimmick how about we use brother branham's word it's a plan demonic that's what it is satan is in control and he controls both sides the red and the blue the conservative and the liberal it doesn't matter he's controlling all agendas he controls both sides of the media both sides of the entertainment industry both sides so i hate the media i do too especially since he's in control of both sides of it one side is just as bad as the other yes i mean it doesn't doesn't matter it doesn't matter which which political hot potato you want to talk about he's in control of it all even even noble endeavors yeah it's a racial injustice is a noble endeavor i'm sorry satan controls both sides of it amen there will be no peace till jesus comes hallelujah oh that's why i love the family of god it never has mattered one second to the family of god red yellow black and white they are all precious in his sight hallelujah oh my so we find that not only does he control both sides of the media hey guess what now he's taking a an increased step here's an insane for you now he controls social media now that's a that's the next level see i want you young people to think about that old people too think about social media i get that it's part of life and we use it to communicate and all these kinds of different things but you just remember who's in control of it friends people will get involved with social media and entertainments that they would never be associated with out in the open enough said satan already has control of the politics he already has control of the educational system he already has control of science and technology he already has control of finance and wealth the whole world uh is geared to it and and the whole system of the world is facilitating this 24 7 tree of knowledge say are you why are you preaching uh on this today because i'm stirring you up i'm i'm making you aware be be aware of his devices they're very cunning and very subtle and the whole world is geared now to facilitate this tree of knowledge although god has warned them and god has described in detail how the antichrist will move they still fall for it though he has declared his own plan of redemption since the days of genesis it's all through the bible yet the world stumbles right past it amen see you know when you're asleep you're alive but you're unaware you're alive when you're asleep you're alive but you're unaware see they are they are literally passing out drunk how they get drunk on the wine of the fornication of the beast but there's a people who can't miss it hallelujah there's a word that's been activated down in you and i and i'm here to tell you just as that antichrist system has accomplished its purpose this word once activated in a believer will accomplish its purpose this word will also take on an image that anti-word is building an image but this word is also building an image of a virtuous queen a bride who's come apart from the world and said i will not be a part of that i may live here but i'm not of here and i'm not from here and i ain't staying here hallelujah i'll come back when jesus is the king of the whole earth oh my in all seven ages to those who would be called out of this world we are being trained we are being conditioned do you accept that today the word came to call you out and to train you and lift you up and transform you there's a hidden manna that's unknown to the world say well that's unfair no they blinded their own self remember they closed their own eyes they stopped up their own ears see it's a hidden manna it wasn't that god was trying to be devious it's that mankind didn't want it and when you don't want god's word then he'll just retract it and you'll never be able to see it again see he's only obligated to call you one time to be a just god and so we find that that that that we have a bride here today that's a bride like mary who's received the word of our day and we're being transformed into what into the image of the word that happened to mary physically it's going to happen to you physically mary physically was transformed in her body to match the image of the word virgin shall be beacon shall conceive and bring forth a child hallelujah it became obvious who the virgin was to the whole world now they had a bad opinion of her but not god god knew exactly who the virgin was because why she had said be it unto me and her body began to be transformed say oh if i could just transform myself mary didn't transform herself no man touched her it was the word of god believed in her heart and it literally changed her abraham had a change in his body sarah had a change in her body because they believed god hallelujah that's word that's the word that's becoming flesh that's what happens in every believer the word which you receive takes on an image god sends his word forth you believe it and he knows and those who are in the mind of god before the foundation of the world they'll run to that light every single time people it might be people who don't know anything about god you don't have to be somebody great that might probably will hinder you you could be a you could be a nobody oh my i like that song brother aaron sings i mean it's a true thing we're up here today what am i trying to do i'm trying to tell everybody about somebody who can help anybody and and if you say i'm a nobody well it's the nobodies he came after hallelujah it's the it's the it's the not quites and the ones who can't ever get it right but i got it right on this hallelujah oh glory to god doesn't matter when the word come whatever age they were in they received it like mary did when we received the word i'm here to tell you something friends that set up that that process of activation in our life and there's where growth takes place there's where maturity takes place and it's quite unstoppable oh let me encourage you today it doesn't matter whether 200 million demons are released from euphrates against you it doesn't matter if all the demons of hell are released against you this word is and will and is changing you it's bringing you to the image of the son of god even the weak when you say oh but i'm weak but when you're weak he's strong hallelujah there's nothing that can stop you you're unstoppable because you're a believer you have received the word of god and when it comes into your life it transforms you you will be changed you take my word for you will be transformed you are being transformed in this journey of your transformation you're gonna come face to face you're with the devil you're gonna come fist to fist you're going to come sword to sword with all the devils that are in hell but i'm here to tell you they're not going to be able to stop god's word my they're not going to be able to stop the word becoming flesh see the word made flesh is happening amen amen too bad satan it's happening i'm here to tell you something friends that the world can say what they want but this word is happening people can jump up and down and run all over the place and deny and call it names and call it a cult and say it's wrong they can do whatever they want to but i already know it's already changing me from glory to glory it's changing me oh my if you think about it friends you didn't choose the age you would come in you didn't choose the word that would come to you you didn't choose the outcome somebody else chose you somebody else is in control of this thing and his word will not return void hallelujah is rejoicing that today his word will not return to him void oh my he has made it secure to all of his family i want to read you two quotes and we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna stop for today i'll carry on next time brother branham says in communion he says this in february teaches this and he's going to do it again the very next month in march but i've there's no need to read two of them saying the same thing but brother branham is talking about now the number the numbers three and the number five and three being perfection and five being grace see so it's j-e-s-u-s or it's g-r-a-c-e or it's f-a-i-t-h c num five is the number of grace now it's significant to a prophet now watch him make a modern event that happened in 1962 might have been the end of 1961 i didn't confirm it in the story but they had an alignment of five stars now this is just prior to the seals coming and brother branham says we see that the astronomers are predicting oh it's actually coming sometime in this early part of the first of the month beginning on the second or the fifth or somewhere along this month see now bear in mind if you go look at the titles the sequence of events is going to go from here on he's more more doors are going to be closed brother branham is going to finally get completely shut out of everything they don't even they don't even want his miracles anymore they they just as far as they're concerned he's gone off the deep end and he finally comes to the to the sermon there's the present stage of my ministry all men hath forsaken me and then he has a strange vision that troubles him and he hears a blast and he comes to the pulpit and sirs is this the time is this the time sirs what time william branham the time he prophesied that would come at the end when a message would strike the earth to call a bride separate her out perfected transformer into the image of the word and take her home to glory have we reached that hour that the church have we reached i'll tell you something friends on resurrection morning it's going to be the day i've waited for and looked for my whole life here was a prophet saying my goodness we've had 2 000 years of church history have we finally reached the time is this the time of the end sirs so now what's he doing he's coming to an astronomical to to something in astronomy and he says he says sometime in the early part of the first part of this month beginning on the second or fifth somewhere in this month the the indian astronomers predict the world to blow to pieces and the american newspapers make fun of it i do not believe the world's going to blow to pieces he says but i do say it's wrong to make fun of it because something's fixing to happen one of these days something similar to that when the five planets mars jupiter venus and so forth comes into there he says i predict that this has a special application i believe it's the coming in of the issue of god that the great revelations of the word will be opened during this time i'll ask you a question believers did it happen oh my oh my remember they claim it was three stars come into their orbits when jesus was born and this is five and five is grace the number of grace three is the number of perfection five is the number of grace j-e-s-u-s g-r-a-c-e f-a-i-t-h so forth number of grace god ever sends his power to the church see if god ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace it won't be the obedience of the people isaiah said in the 40th chapter how to cry to jerusalem that her warfare was over yet she was guilty of idolatry but it was god's grace that was sending it god sends anything to us it'll be his grace not our merits so it may mean something i predict that there will be a change i don't know what it'll be but i believe it's fixing to happen we're right on the eve of it now he goes on in the next month to describe it he says what is what three stars announced the coming messiah announced christ the baby he said five stars have lined up he said what is it announcing an infant bride it's announcing her approach i'm going to tell you something friends when god took a prophet and he took him into the wilderness and fulfilled that vision and sent him back for the opening of the seals and a message began to sweep in and a prophet and the word and everything exactly and an infant bride who was now ready to come on the scene like mary who would believe the word of god it would be as i preached you here some time ago grace is the encampment of the redeemed the headstone comes crying grace grace unto it it's no longer going to be about our works and trying to do this and trying to do that it's going to be grace say well we got faults and we got failure so did israel but god was coming to them we got idolatry that's right but i'm bringing grace i'm coming to redeem jerusalem even though jerusalem didn't look like they deserved redemption but it was grace that came and that is what the world now imagine being blind to the greatest thing that has ever happened in the world where a message would come that you could believe and receive with your whole mind and your whole heart to where it could transform you and come down inside and activate a seated seat gene of god and begin to grow you and mature you and raise you up so that god would no longer look at you he would only look at his word and you're a believer and righteousness is imputed to you like it was abraham hallelujah i'm glad my eyes are open i'm glad i see blessed are your eyes and your ears for they see in here oh we are to be glad this morning friends we ought to rejoice in the grace of almighty god see this is exactly why now watch now brother branham is going to extrapolate that now you're going to find out why this next point was so important to him and i'm going to stop right here now brother branham comes the end of 1965 and he's in his vile series he's finishing it out a thinking man's filter now the bride has come a long ways since february 1962. now she's in night the end of 1965 and everything that i've preached you this morning has become true and a prophet is about to leave the earth and here's one of the last things that he's going to give to the church to get you home how many want it this is one of the last points that he wants you to absorb lest the plague of the seventh vial affect your mind how many want it how many want to keep a sane mind how many want to stay pleasing to god you want to avoid the insanity of the world all right here he comes uh we've been quoting and quoting and quoting during this series what have we been telling you it's brother branham he wasn't preaching on the vials but he was preaching the things that would impact us because the vials were partially poured out and this is how you stay sane and this is how you one of the ways among all the other ones that we've been reading to you here's one of the last ones as the days grow closer and closer and the narrowing of the path we want to go closer together amen now he's giving you he's giving you an inoculation you won't need to wear a mask if you get this inoculation and you won't have to worry about side effects with this inoculation well you will it'll change your life and make you like god all right i'll take it so he says as the days grow closer and closer and the narrowing of the path church as i'm as i'm in my vile series as it were i i've went through i've had all of these weeks remember i read you the quote where he come to the end he said now i think you've got a better idea of what those vials have been about now he's coming here to say all right we've got to move on we've come to the end of our series i've got other meetings to go preach now let me give you one of these last things as the day grows closer and closer and the narrowing of the path we want to grow closer together we must be just one one body we must move together i hope you're going to say amen to this one forgetting one another's sins and our differences and just stick closer and closer and closer as we see that day approaching assembling of ourselves together that was weak assembling ourselves together all with one accord and one heart and if a brother sister gets out of the way in any way that's pretty broad this is seventh vial advice this keeps you sane this is an inoculation if a brother sister gets out of the way in any way don't do nothing but pray for that person and in love always considering one another here's some vile protection don't never let one of you get away stay together and if you can add more to it constantly all the time hallelujah i just say okay brother branham all right thank you thank you faithful messenger i'm going to do that i'm going to put it into practice because i realized that five stars came and it was grace and it's no longer going to be my ups and downs and ins and outs and my favorites and my weaknesses and all my obedience whether i am or whether i'm not i have a desire to be because why i've been changed i've cut something has been activated inside of me and my whole desire now is for god and if i make a little mistake don't hold it against me don't do nothing but pray for me if you make a little mistake i won't hold it against you we won't we'll we'll stay together we'll pull together we'll pray for one another we'll assemble ourselves together come on bethel amen hallelujah that's our protection that's just as as big of a part of your seventh vile inoculation as as it is to understand the mystery of the antichrist system because he might he might can't fool you on doctrine but if he if he trips you on that one you'll still you'll still offend one for whom christ died and you'll still judge your brother when paul said you should never do that see so this this now and and i'm just having to stop today there's so much more i want to say let's stand to our feet amen that's plenty enough amen i keep going you're going to oversponge you hey man come on brother joe i want you to sing that song for me again i asked brother joe oh my i just held on that's me i'm gonna tell you something friends not you know not like holding on like i'm about to i'm about to fall into the world no i'm holding on to something i love and i'm holding on for dear life because i know that there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's and i can't get eternal life i couldn't even i couldn't even get me my life i can't even keep my life it could leave this body at any at any time how much less are you able to gain eternal life if you couldn't even get the one or keep the one you got how much greater is it to have eternal life now because i have eternal life this life could pass away it wouldn't matter i'd still be alive hallelujah oh my amen praise the lord let's sing brother amen i'm still standing oh you wonder how i made it through the storm think about these words now well i can't boast of any special power oh there's no secret i

is gone they'll hardly know she's gone what then lord i pray that the word that went forth today i know it penetrated hearts now lord may you water that seed it was a seed of the gospel that was sown in hearts young hearts young people i was watching them lord they were they were glued in they were zeroed in old folks married folks single folks this is a treacherous hour in a very serious hour and

to us it's why you've come among us lord god we've reached that time we've reached that hour we've talked about it we've sung about it we've preached about it for years but lord i could say now just as that prophet right before it was happening just months away and i can say to this bride sirs is this the time of the catching away think hard brothers and sisters young people is this the time the church has waited for all these centuries we've seen the manifestation lord of everything your prophecy everything in prophecy that your word said would happen has now happened and there's not one other thing left lord god it's all reached its climax now only the coming brother branham would even say i'm not looking for revival i'm looking for the coming of the lord speaking of a word revival

it to harvest there's not another rain not another revival coming not for the gentiles the next revival will be in israel we're almost home lord help us father in our minds and our hearts to be ready let us think lord let the let the saints think lord i made a case today i took them through the scriptures slowly i proved it back and forth from genesis to revelation i i made them judge it as i was preaching it lord i asked them repeatedly can you see it am i wrong is it is it as we're describing did god do this is the world like this can anybody deny these things [Music] isn't it true that satan has control of all of the venues all the media all the social media all the education all the technology all the politics both sides of the aisle the whole fabric of society twisted in their minds asleep alive but unaware because they're drunken they're they're passing out drunk from the fornication of the beast help us to think deeply lord god deal with hearts i pray men and women married and single young and old male and female not only in this building out across the airwaves we we know we have families home today streaming we know we'll have them across the sea streaming
