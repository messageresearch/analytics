thank you and uh we're going to do a little missions report and then we'll go to the word uh I don't I know how Matt wriggled his way out of this but uh I wanted him to help me with this since he was huge part of the trip but uh he said no no you you do it well he he had some insight there because he's not here to help me so I'll do my best to talk on his behalf from some of the testimonies that he's brought so let's let's go to the Lord in prayer if you have a need upon your heart lift your hand to the Lord Heavenly Father you see what's behind every one of those hands and every one of those needs Lord and I ask now that you would move supernaturally behind those needs from every heart Lord grant healing Grant Deliverance Lord grant wisdom Grant provision whatever the need is there Lord move upon those things father our faith is reaching out to make connection with you Lord based upon your promises for each one of those things Lord we ask that you would just give leadership and wisdom Lord as we look at the missions report all glory belongs to you we thank you for what you've done Lord and how you've moved in people's lives I pray Lord that you would just Inspire us and lead each one of us Lord in our own lives we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen you be seated first time go well actually I I have to correct that second time going to hurus first time on a mission strip first time we went was uh a cruise on Raton Honduras so a little different purpose but the Lord laid it when I after we went there somehow um a burden was laid on my heart to go to Honduras my my good friend brother Steven Carlin from Minneapolis has gone to do missions there uh three or four times and uh has known brother Paco there for quite some time I think some of you you probably familiar with brother Paco but to me I've known him probably known of him for 20 years but um and his missions work and and how the Lord has used him but got the chance to finally meet him there it was a great blessing to me we um brother Matt and I as if you're young you probably could see that the first on the left the arrow um kuga that's where the airport is now the old dangerous airport in tuuku galpa is I think it's closed now so thank the lord we didn't have to go into that one um so we went and the other one just makes it a little further because the place we went to was like the third Arrow there called Tanga um our host was brother Eric you'll see a picture of him next he's the pastor in that City Tanga and then the youth meeting was up in the the northwest of there at kakamas just outside of there up the mountain a little bit and just getting in brother Eric picked us up he's got two boys pastoring the church there and brother Matt uh how the trip ended up going is other than the Youth Camp they split us up wherever we went so um brother Matt preached at two different churches on the first Sunday that we were there I guess the only Sunday that he was there and I I preach two services at one church with the pastor's brother Lucas cordona and um actually I don't remember what brother Matt ministered on but I ministered on the priesthood of all believers in the morning and the hidden uh the mystery of hidden wisdom from the seventh seal in the evening there and uh was good hard-hitting messages dealing with situations there um the pastor told me when I when after the first he said during the week he had been uh ministering on um the role of pastors and Ministry and missionary work and so the priesthood of all believers tied into that and and and family as well he was spoke about that and then in the evening speaking on the seventh seal he said he'd been speaking about that throughout the week so it was timely for them um Satur Sunday his brother Lucas the pastor in the middle and brother Noel interpreter brother Noel actually lived in the states for a number of years and his uh his sister and his nephew and niece actually go to brother Mike Wall's Church in Maryland so um he was very good interpreter brother Lucas his wife had a stroke um earlier this year and he just went in the room and she was laying there just totally to him it seemed like she was gone brought her to the hospital that there's nothing we can do said can you at least try to work on her they just left her in the bed to die so he went in he turned on brother brandom with a Spanish translation nothing so then he just turned on the English uh sermon and it was she opened her eyes right then soon as she heard the voice of the prophet and she's still in in rough rough shape um but she's there in the home and he's taking care of her to pray for him it's a it's a heavy burden to carry but he's doing his best to help her and and stand with her Matt they're praying for some that's at um Brick's church Sunday morning and this little girl is a quite a testimony um on Monday evening brother Eric said let's I was not feeling well enough to go but brother Matt went to the hospital she was suffering from dang fever quite dangerous and she had like rash all over her body and quite a high fever Matt prayed for her early evening they went out to eat came back brother Eric came to talk to us and said hey I'm going to go I'm going to go check on that little sister at the hospital to see how she's doing and he did and sent back pictures she's completely well no no rash no fever and then few days later we went over for her grandfather's birthday party and there she was and brother Matt was able to take a picture of her so thank the Lord for for his grace and uh I believe on Tuesday night we went to this little city called um singing frogs that's the translation there and uh it's always an adventure driving on the roads there every time I had my Apple watch on every time we went on those roads it'd be like 7 to 10 minutes of exercise that I got in being in the car because you got to like hold yourself forward and engage your core otherwise you'll be th you're thrown and thrashed everywhere so but we got there and it's a wonderful service the Lord moved supernaturally there at brother Beck and reyes's church the office there the pastor on the far right and then the the the young man between brother beckan and brother Matt is uh brother Noel's nephew that lives in um Maryland area trying to get him to come to Youth Camp this this fall be back in the state soon and um this is a incredible testimony I just this is It's amazing And I I guess I mean 75 years old one of the oldest one of the first message Believers in all of Honduras he has in his family I believe he has UH 60 grandchildren 12 children so he's got 70 he's almost caught up with Jacob so uh they wanted us to come over before we went to the youth meeting to pray pray over him and say a few words over him before the family at his birthday party so that was a great blessing for us to be able to to do that and uh met up there on the way uh to the youth meetings with brother Lise and his wife Sister Christine brother Luis is from if you don't know who he is he's from um goes to brother way Dale's Church there spoken word church and he's been a good friend of mine and brother Matt's for quite a while so it's a huge blessing for him to come he ended up translating most of our services there in uh at the youth meeting hey Josh you messing with me back there there we go all right Honduras is very beautiful country this is on one of the roads lots of lots of farmland and mountains and even Farmland on the mountains somehow they've learned how to I mean you'll see those they're just like up like that and they got corn and coffee growing on the side of the mountain uh this is a huge method of travel that you see I don't know how they stay in the back of the vehicles as they're going over those roads but somehow they do first morning of the Youth Camp there I think the number as they said there was about 250 people there in total had a tent set up this actually their one of the the church that's their probably 20 minutes drive out of the city there brother Eric had brought a vehicle that he had uh borrowed from a brother and we got there and we were getting ready to leave we couldn't leave because we had to find another ride because the vehicle was just a car and it wouldn't have made it over the river that you have to literally drive through so a brother in a in a in a four 4x4 came and picked us up and we went through the river to get up to the to the meetings well brother Solomon Huffman from Brother joshh Bennett's church was there also and ministered at the youth meetings he was mostly traveling with brother Paco during the first part of the trip and we were with brother Eric brother Paco is the one right next to me between brother Matt and I in the middle is Brother Ali aasta he's the he was the person that was organizing the meeting and he's he's a he's a really a missionary an evangelist but he's overseeing pastoring that church there while they're while they're trying to find a permanent Pastor that's there outside of katakam this some uh finally got to eat um solid meal at Pizza Hut good ministered there um I think brother brother Matt ministered on the broken but not bitter um his evening service that he had he just had one service CU he left needed to leave on Saturday and I ministered on overcoming depression um and uh Freedom the youth and the teaching in the morning wonderful Services brother Matt just really knocked it out of the park in his his evening service you could see the Holy Spirit was really using him to bring a a Unity of amongst the ministers even just reminding them of what how glorious this message and how Vindicated and how true it is and it was it really brought a Revival brother Solomon ministered the Saturday night service and but a number came up for prayer there it was very uh simple but hard-handed message then the next day we sort of split split ways um brother Solomon and traded off brother Solomon went with brother Eric and I went with brother Paco and I ministered at the church that's in the city of kakamas the brother there on the left is brother nef Pastor there and he was I ministered on the seventh seal when I was there which was fascinating because he had been he had ministered on the six seals he'd finished that and he was of floundering he said cuz I wasn't sure how to really enter into the seventh seal it was it was the Sunday for me to preach on the seventh seal but the Lord just sent you to bring it clear for us well that is the end of the missions report it was a great blessing for me I'm going to be home for another um 12 days and then I'm heading to Zombia so keep me in prayer um if you want to go ahead and stand we'll go to the word and we're going to read in um I think I'm going to finish up see how much time do I have just like brother Jason there's no telling what actually will happen My Hope Is that I will finish up my part four of overcoming depression but no promises can be made because who knows what happens Proverbs 12 verse 25 and I'm going to go ahead and read it from the new King James version anxiety in the heart of man causes depression but a good word makes it glad let's pray father we just want to commit this time of going to the word into to your hands Lord as we change the order from testifying to preaching Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit would come and anoint both speaker and hearer Lord speak into our hearts we ask tonight in Jesus name amen God bless you so just to lay before you what we spoke very very Bri briefly before um really the key is in Philippians chapter 4 we're looking at the scripture says don't uh do not be anxious be careful for nothing do not be anxious but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving make your requests known to God then the the God of Peace will be with you then then the peace that passes all understanding will guard your hearts see it's a then we you know the B the the scripture says in uh the King James it says and but if you look closely it's saying then other words it's connected to what it said before we pray and we ask the Lord to give us peace we go to the minister cast off a spirit of depression wonderful God does that supernaturally however the problem with that is what ends up happening is you go out and you have the same mind that you had before and you then you're wearing those paths out back to the devil speaking to you and gaining control over your mind and that's the that's the danger in not having a renewing of our mind that's a that's a huge part of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is it's not merely a Deliverance but it's a strengthening to overcome and so when we if we want to overcome depression right depression is an end result as we saw from the scripture anxiety which comes from a fear right then the next step is depression right what's the step after depression a suicidal mind or spirit and so brother Brandon makes it clear it's it's a depression is a spirit anxiety even is a spirit it's like a dark Spirit hanging over a person and so it's a spiritual warfare that you're facing and ultimately it comes down to what are you going to believe believe are you going to believe the worry that the devil puts in your mind or are you going to believe the promise of God that's written in the scriptures and so when you're facing these B understand it's a battle when you're depressed you should go ding ding ding I'm in a battle not ding ding ding there's something wrong with me ding ding ding there's these are all the thoughts that the devil is planting and when you if it's brother Bram says how do we know if it's the devil or not if it's with the word it's from God if it's not if it's against the word it's obviously from the devil so worry based is based in fear so you're thinking about a situation and you're you're you you're putting your unbelief into operation about that situation right so God says don't do that instead pray make your make your requests known to God then give thanks that's speaking of worship get in his presence worship him then peace will come right and then he says finally brothers and he goes through the list he gives you a literally a bullet point not a literally bullet point but you know what I'm saying step by step here's what you should think about right and the God of Peace will be with you right so he's giving you the antidote the antidote isn't just stop worrying it's actually you have to be filled with something else you have to be filled with the word you have to be filled with the mind of Christ and so I want to I want to speak about five men of God who made a prayer request unto God concerning themselves all right what did they what was their prayer request they wanted death can you imagine job faced obviously impossible unexplained circumstances that produced such intense physical and mental suffering that he prayed that the day he was born had never come or if that if not that Lord would you would it also be okay if the day that that he would have died at Birth my goodness Moses faces a situation the children of Israel are complaining they want meat they're sick of Mana Moses is angry well God was angry too so Moses was disappointed in the children of Israel so he says God you put all this burden on me alone me alone and I can't bear it and if this is how it's going to be God just kill me out of hand Elijah he brings fire down from heaven killed the prophets of Baal asked God to bring rain he then ran supernaturally ran a marathon to jezrael then the messenger of Jezebel comes and says I'm going to make you like one of the prophets of baale I'm going to kill you next thing he Journeys 107 miles instead of facing it he runs to Beba 107 Mi South leaves his servant there and he says that's not far enough for me I'm going to go further I'm going to go into the neev to hide which if you've ever been to the neev it's a good place to hide that's where David went to hide from Saul and what was his prayer request dear God take my life away I'm not better than my father's Jonah went to Nineveh well not by his own choosing he went the other way but God said you don't have a choice in the matter Jonah you're going there anyhow he knew that the Assyrians would repent and he didn't want that to happen he he he in his prayer he says God I knew that that you're a merciful god forgiving the iniquity of those who repent so if this is how it's going to be kill me preaches a great Revival the whole city comes to the Altar for repentance they even bring their animals to repent I don't know why they needed to repent but apparently they thought they had to repent too and his result was because he was so angry he says I'm so angry I do well to be angry even to the point of death all right Jeremiah just came across my reading in my reading today Jeremiah 20 ver7 Josh if you want to bring that up Jeremiah 20:7 oh Lord thou Hast deceived me and I was deceived that's a little bit of a tricky uh thing there because God God is not a liar God doesn't deceive anyone uh the the sense that Jeremiah is making here is God you you brought me here uh to preach to these people and uh I think that's a different translation of the Bible you want to switch back to the jjv um so the sense is you you called me to do this you called me to preach and now the result is I'm in the stocks so it's like you you you laid your hand on me and and now they laid they laid their hand on me you're stronger than I and have prevailed I'm in derision daily everyone mocks me verse 8 for since I spake I cried out I cried violence and spoil because the word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me and a derision daily then I said I'll not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name but his word was in Mine Heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay so here Jer Jeremiah says I'm I'm not I'm not preaching anymore I quit and God lays his hand upon Jeremiah with the word of the Lord and Jeremiah says I okay I can't I can't I can't resist God he's forcing me to do it now verse 10 for I heard the defaming of many fear on every side report say they and we will report all my familiars watch for my halting saying per Adventure he'll be enticed and we shall Prevail against him and we shall take our revenge on him but the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one therefore my persecutors shall stumble and they shall not Prevail they shall be greatly ashamed for they shall not Prosper their Everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten I want to skip up to 14 cursed be the day wherein I was born let not the day wherein my mother bear me be blessed cursed be the man who brought Tidings to my father saying a man child is born unto thee making him very glad and let that man be as the cities which the Lord overthrew and repented not and let him hear the cry in the mourning and the shouting at noon time because he slew me not from the womb or that my mother have been my my grave and her womb to be always great with me wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow that my days should be consumed with shame my goodness that's depression that's sorrow brother brandham in the sermon you can take that down brother Josh brother brandham in the sermon adoption number three oh I love that sound yesterday he said people don't know what depressing times come with this type of ministry I got real depressed and I said to the wife I wish I could just go on she said why you say that bill I said oh here I have troubles and things and then seemed like the holy spirit said are you trying to bypass them are you trying to dodge them see no I said just let me stand right up in the face of it all and face it out Hallelujah all right now that's the way to face your troubles that's the way to face your problems I'm going to stand up and face it head on like a man now I want to point out each of these instances of men of God having anxiety that led them to be depressed and have Suicidal Thoughts started with the wrong way of thinking about the situation that they were in God comes to job and says who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge in other words God tells job you're thinking wrong about the situation now God didn't Blas he didn't blaspheme he said the lord gave the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord but then his friends came and said hey this is because you're a secret sinner now the question changed and job is confused and he starts uttering all kinds of things about I wish I was dead I wish this I wish that and God says you you don't even know what's going on what you why are you trying to figure it out when you have no idea all right Moses thought wrongly about the situation he was in instead of praying and asking God what to do he got angry said you put this burden on me alone says me alone God didn't put that burden on him alone Mo Moses was just a voice that God used and God was there the whole time doing every single thing God LED God provided God did the miraculous God protected Moses merely needed to trust God through this situation instead he put it upon himself and ended up asking for death Elijah instead of standing by faith and asking God def to defend him ran away like a coward he ended up out in the wilderness alone saying God please kill me walking by fear instead of walking by faith Jonah had the wrong thinking about God's heart for Gentiles and it led him to a hatred for them and not wanting them to be delivered he was more concerned about vegetables than he was about people and this led him down a path of anger despair depression every one of those circumstances led to a response that was not rooted in faith it was rooted in fear they thinking about the situation was wrong and then it led them down the wrong path of thinking anxiety depression and dark thoughts I want to point out that the world tries to give a remedy remedy to a problem that's rooted in unbelief and lack of faith now also want to point out how did God approach his servants in every situation in all but one of them which was Jonah God provided corre Comfort right what did he do to Moses Moses you're alone here's 70 brothers that will stand with you Elijah I'm going to send my softest handed Angel to touch you and give you some something to eat right job God himself came that was the Comfort just said dinosaurs and you seen them um see you seen them dragons see those yeah can can you can you hunt them easily can you invite them to a banquet no but I can control all of them I'm your comfort job see and then and then we find brother Branham the Holy Ghost came to him and spoke to his heart and said stand and face it don't run from your troubles Jonah just had he got correction right Jeremiah the Lord was with him and comforted him delivered him from the stocks now the world will offer you a thousand excuses for your behavior it it'll offer you a thousand reasons they're all the wrong reasons they're all the wrong approaches they're all they're they're all bringing the wrong direction because it starts from the wrong foundation so we talked about before about psychology Psychotherapy Psych Tropic drugs all of that doesn't bring a long-term solution e even if you really understand many of the quote unquote mental illnesses that they call today are just a figment of people's imagination they're created by a medical society that's corrupted and under the control of the devil and the purpose of it is to is a satanic plot to keep people as perpetual victims the world does not have a real remedy they might have a Band-Aid that could work temporarily but the real remedy is offered to us in the word of God God's armor is all Supernatural and how is it operated by reasoning by education by intellect by faith every one of his pieces of armor is operated by faith faith comes from the gene of God in the human soul but we know that Faith also operates through channels five channels of the spirit memory conscience reason imagination affections if any of these channels are clogged they will hinder Faith from operating in our lives the message of the hour came to blow out all those channels GL by the power of the Holy Ghost from the soul not an anointing on the channels but a transformed nature in the soul that's changed from the inside out there's a cleansing just like that oil comes from the inside of the dove to the outside it's it it cleanses everything in its path so that the outside is then clean it's what Jesus said you have to make first the inside of the cup clean and then the outside will follow if you try to just make the out side clean you'll be end up with dirty a filthy cup anyways all right the world wants to give a remedy dealing only with the channels right they're just going to they're just going to poke their hands into the mental channels of the spirit they're going to say if we fix this if we fix this well this happened because of your memory of your dad this happened because of this well talk about that more Lord willing God has a supernatural ability to operate by the holy spirit in the soul to change our nature it's called sanctification it's called The Washing of Water by the word it's called the renewing of our mind again not an external Force an internal Supernatural force that cleans es all those channels from sin and evil all right now we mentioned trauma past history those things and brother Brandon points this out those things can be instructive as to why you're facing trouble today the pro the the issue can become this is that you assign accountability and blame for your actions but notice the Bible never lets you do that Ezekiel 18 1-4 the word of the Lord came unto me again saying what mean ye that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel saying the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge as I live saith the Lord God you shall not have occasion anymore to use this proverb in Israel behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinth it shall die we're all held accountable for our own actions our own reactions our own responses our own attitudes and everything we do at at at if you make it to the day of the Judgment you're not going to be asked I say you make it into the day of the Judgment because the bride is already judged and delivered that but if one were to make it to the day the white Throne judgment it's going to the Lord's not going to say did your father make you do that did your mother's mistreatment of you force you to sin and again I those things can explain a disposition you have it is not an excuse to continue walking in sin it's not an excuse to continue walking in evil god holds us personally accountable if we're disobedient to his word regardless of what happened in the past God does not allow excuses we love excuses I I I I thank God for my brother he was my basketball coach and he trained me because I made an I I messed up in practice I made an excuse and he was so angry with me he drove me home after practice don't you ever make an excuse again for what you did own it and if if you if you feel you need to apologize you own it and you apologize for it don't sit here oh well I did this because that's just you're being weak don't do that and that's the truth we are in charge of our own behavior we're not victims you're just a victim of circumstances how about you sayi an overcomer the word of God gives me an escape is that isn't that what the Bible says 1 Corinthians 10 verse 12 wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lesty fall there is no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're are able but will with the Temptation also make a way of es way to escape that you may be able to to Bear it so Temptations come Trials Come difficulties come bruises come trauma comes God makes a way for you to escape it he doesn't want you living as a victim of your circumstances the Holy Ghost is given unto you to become an overcomer I was abused I was mistreated I anything any of the worst things you can imagine imagine there is power in the Holy Ghost to be delivered and set free and to walk as an overcomer not as a victim and the Very traumas that you had God actually if you can receive it tonight the holy spirit's telling you this God is going to use your trauma he's going to heal it and you then will be a means of bringing healing to someone that's gone through the same thing that you went through many times you see this you see this in the ministry of uh over in Egypt the woman who was a a uh uh she went there as a missionary uh and I went to the I went to the um uh orphanage Lilian Trasher what did she do she brought in these w women who were victims and what did what did God use these women who are victims to do he used them to minister to other women that were victims God didn't say oh your victim victims it's I'm so I'm so sorry just sit over there and cry and then control everybody with your emotions I'm sorry but that's many times what happens God doesn't sit you doesn't bring you to Christ give you the Holy Ghost to sit and suck your thumb he's brought you to Min to minister in the things that you are broken in to help heal other people 2 Corinthians 1 8-11 for we would not Brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia we are pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raises the Dead who delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet Deliver Us you also helping together by prayer for us us that the for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf doesn't sound like much of a victim sounds like someone who went through a horrible thing and comes out as walking in Victory because he learned I can't trust in myself I'm trusting in The God Who raises the dead now if God can raise the dead can he heal a rape victim if God can raise the Dead can he heal an abuse victim and raise them up to health so that they can be a means of Deliverance for others that's what my Jesus does don't walk in the victim mentality God always provides a means of Deliverance a means of escape a remedy for pain for trauma for sorrow for ways of thinking that are contrary to the word look at what Jesus read in the synagogue Isaiah 61 1-3 Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach good tinings unto the meek he sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound and we'll skip to verse three to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they may be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified I want I want to say to you tonight this Jesus the Same anointing that Came Upon Jesus to do these things is the same anointing that comes on You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be this to others and so you might have been you might have been a victim of any of these things you might have been suffering depression but he gives you the oil of joy for that you might have been suffering from the spirit of heaviness but he gives you the Garment of Praise for that he wants to be glorified in the planting that he's doing in your life Jesus the things the griefs that you had the sorrow that you had Jesus bore it on the cross at Calvary surely he's borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did we esteem him smiing stricken smiing that's a new word write that down brother Jason that's real bad smiing is real bad stricken smitten of God and Afflicted God laid our trials our difficulties our pain our trauma our depression our sorrow our sadness all on Christ the price has been paid you can go free tonight you don't have to stay in bondage to it it's not through Psychotherapy psychotropic drugs that we receive Deliverance these are poor replacements for the power of the gospel and the Deliverance that comes to us through the supernatural if we follow if we really and truly follow God's word and use what he's provided Us in this world we don't need we don't need to be stay in the victim mentality that psych Psychotherapy is going to give to you that's all that nonsense is based on atheism Marxism it's a deception it's it's based on evolution short term it might help it's not permanent healing it's not permanent deliverance and the fact is the way the very nature of how psychology approaches problems brings en enlivens strengthens continues the problems themselves any thinking contrary to God's word actually we have to take take and kill it we have to take every thought isn't that what Paul said take every thought captive to The Obedience of Christ casting down high things in every imagination that exalts itself against the knowledge of Christ again we talked about before biblical counseling is very different than a a uh psychology session biblical counseling is placing the word in individually it's just what we're doing with preaching we're placing the word in brother Bram said that's what preaching does is to change your mind even says pervert your mind from the things of the world to the things of the word right and so that's what Biblical counseling is from a pastor from a minister is laying in the word in an individual or in a couple basis so certainly is needed friendship is needed talking through things sometimes is needed sometimes it's not needed but a re a real friend a real spouse that loves you sometimes that's better than anything they know you in and out and they can help correct you that's really what we need many times is we we we we think we just need someone to Pat and baby us and maybe that's good a little bit I think you see God does Pets the men of God that were struggling to give them Comfort but more more so I think we're called a little bit higher than Jeremiah than job then Elijah right we are the person that's the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than John the Baptist so John the Baptist was the greatest of all the prophets so we're not not called to lay in the stocks and say God take my life we're called to lay in the stocks and say thank you Lord You're the great deliverer I'm not looking at my circumstances I'm not looking looking at the situation that I'm facing I'm looking to you and to your promises secondarily sometimes when we say we need to talk to people or go to a psychologist we're actually breaking the word because what we actually do is we go tell on something that somebody else did to hurt us and that's bypassing the scripture which says if your brother sins against you go to him directly and we bypass that and what do we do we create a psychological problem for ourselves that wasn't even necessary you create a complex upon a complex when if you just did what Jesus said moreover If thy brother trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou has gain the my brother 99% of the time it's just a misunderstanding and you just resolved it and no there doesn't even need to be repentance maybe just from you for misunderstanding 99% of the time that solves the problem one% of the time you have a stubborn Sinner and you got to go fetch the pastor might it not even be that much my experience it's always a misunderstanding oh I didn't understand that I thought you were saying this and you said this and it's resolved or we could just go to someone else did you know this person said this oh yeah uh they're always doing stuff like that man they just drive me crazy and now you have a whole complex about a person and you didn't even understand the situation correctly and now you got to go see a psychologist because you're so messed up really it I mean these things it's funny but these things happen people go into depression they run from church they run they they run from situation they've never resolved anything in their life so they're just Runners and then it's somebody else's fault of course they never squarely realize that the finger Point's right back at them I'm just repeating the same problem and God graciously is giving you the same problem over and over again so that you can get it right because he loves you see if he didn't love you he'd just say go on because he loves you he says hey you're going to have to face this pal the problem is looking at you in the mirror be a real Christian and deal with it deal with your issues I think that's really if I can kind of bring it to a summation is we all have struggles we all have battles that we face in our mind but the the the thing is we have to actually face the problems the problem is when we run from the problems or try to push the problem onto something else someone else are you perfect you're sinless you have never made a mistake before Oh God bless you but if you're like me and all the other rest of the people in the church you make mistakes you're full of mistakes and you've have situations that you've refused to face the problem you refuse to face the fear I think um brother I heard brother Eugene preaching the other day and he said if fear comes up that's an indicator of that's the thing that you have to face so if there's a fear in your life go deal with it face it because you'll never be an overcomer until you face your fear and it doesn't become your fear anymore God doesn't want us depressed God doesn't want us walking in worry and fear and anxiety and again we've this this comes down to you if if you're walking in that what it comes down to if you're really a holy ghost filled Christian you have trained yourself to think that way you could say well I'm just I'm a nervous person that you're training yourself you have accepted a malady upon yourself that the word of God doesn't declare over you the word says that you're to have peace right so if you do what the word says peace will follow if you do Paul Paul even goes as far as to say that which you have heard from me what you've seen in me that do then the God of Peace will be with you so I would take that present tense is the things that you have seen in as an example in the life of brother brandham things that you've heard him preach do then the God of Peace will be with you the problem is we lack peace because we're not doing the word we're doing it our way and we're say oh God give me peace I need peace and God's saying are you the words right there in front of you to live of giving the Holy Spirit to empower you to do it you're not a victim you can overcome that musicians if you'd come you're not subject to that so these are the these are the things the enemy will come with fear for sure every time I preach this the enemy comes at me hard and I I'll slip down the path if I'm not if I don't fight the more I preach it the more I fight but you ha you have to being Godly there's a training that goes along with it a training in the word it's time for you to pick up the sword and fight it's time for you to say I'm I'm going to walk in Victory with the sword of the Lord I'm going to take that I'm not only going to speak it but I'm going to be a doer of the word I'm going to live the word and then peace is going to follow in my life with your own thought don't be obsessed with how you think about situations every situation take it back to the word what does the word say what does faith say about this circumstance and this situation you become obsessed with oh I have to take a mental health day today really are we that babied Christians of old were rugged when brother bandham says that I don't hear Christians of old were rugged y'all a bunch of soft soap babies I I hear God's calling me to be rugged right God's calling me to be tough he's not calling me to have a thin skin and everything that everybody does offends me thicken up your skin get tough and go in the word of God and if the Devil comes and says you know that person meant this say shut up devil I don't accept that way line of thinking about other people I don't accept the line of thinking about how I feel at any given moment I'm accepting the word and my feelings have to conform to the word if you want to overcome depression what what do I say to you conform your thoughts to the word how do you conform your thoughts to the word you feed on the word you find a situation in your life and you search the word and then you repeat that word to yourself over and over again and then you repeat it to God and you remind God this is your promise for me right now I'm receiving it by faith thank you Lord that's exactly what the word says to do take that walk in that and you'll be an overcomer amen let's stand Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your mercy and your grace Lord we thank you for each believer here Lord their heart cries out Amen to the word of God Lord I'm crying out Amen to the word I thank you so much for giving it to us Lord for giving us healing for giving us Deliverance to giving us the oil of Joy Lord for mour I pray Lord that each one would enter in to that
