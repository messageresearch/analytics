Lord can reveal oh sorry buddy the Lord can reveal himself Amen to children at a very early age now I know at this age he's just looking at all you strange people going who in the world but I love that children are brought into the presence of God and they're able to get used to the anointing of the Holy Spirit that's one of the ways to raise them up in the admonition of the Lord amen that's part of applying the token to your home is bringing them into contact with the Holy Spirit that's what token when you apply something you bring it into contact amen so we like to bring our families it's a sad home that doesn't bring their family into contact with the holy spirit amen praise the Lord let's pray this little guy's heavy Lord Jesus I hold in my hands a precious gift that it's a it's the heritage of the lord it's a treasure that you give and Lord this couple comes today to give back that which you have given confessing Lord that they have no way Lord to raise this child within human intelligence it would be a horrible travesty Lord we find that the whole world has fallen into madness because they don't apply the principles of God's word so they're bringing him now to say father help raise this boy amen raise him in your admonition raise him in the way that he should go give them Supreme wisdom now Lord and let it be a happy home under your blessing we commit Uriah dedicating him to you in the name of Jesus Christ praise the Lord amen woo wow God bless you amen [Applause] my goodness that boy is you feeding him whole chickens already or something wow potato eating outfit praise the Lord amen let's stand back to our feet this morning I want to make just a couple of quick announcements while to have you standing Noah good to see you today praise the Lord standing on two feet amen praise the Lord amen there's a young man got a lot to be grateful to the Lord for so we're happy to see him in our midst today the enemy enemy tried to strike him and so just to see him standing amen able to come in here under his own power that's the blessing of the Lord amen we were sure praying for you brother Noah so we I I sent this out to the church we're having a special Christmas service on Sunday the 22nd and that's where I'll be bringing my Christmas message and that's I'm I'm using the vernacular of brother brandham that's what he called it he called it his Christmas message and so I'm just glad we know the truth about Christmas amen and uh what a what a true Christmas is to the believer amen there's no midweek service on Wednesday the 25th our full Sunday service Returns on the 29th we'll have a regular Sunday school and regular service and then we announced also our New Year's Eve SLC communion foot Washing Service from 700 to 9:00 p.m. on Tuesday December 31 um and of course then there'd be no service the next day on January 1 which would be a Wednesday but we'll be meeting there it's not a watch night we don't U exactly do that haven't done that in a while nothing against it at all but our way is to just come together and have a little time of dedication communion and foot washing amen I'm one who who doesn't like to see children you know brought home well after midnight and people driving home the world has become so crazy friends it's not not like it was 40 5050 years ago the streets are filled with drunken party revelers at that hour amen so uh we like to get the people out on New Year's Eve and get them back home amen that does my heart good praise the Lord I'm sure you got the prayer request brother Luther that brother Aaron had turned in want to make sure we continue to pray amen for that poor man in his situation any updates for there okay so he's had four surgeries already my goodness wow we'll we'll keep praying for him we're going to read just one verse and then I'm going let you be seated um in St John chapter 15 and um I realized that I didn't send anything to the booth today sorry about that team um but I want to take a title today from St John 15 and I want to speak on abiding in Christ abiding in Christ amen praise the Lord all right we'll read this first verse and let let you be seated because we want to look down through it I don't I don't think I'll get to everything today uh this has been a thought that's been very dear to my heart and the Lord has um really made a lot of things real it's incredible to me I will confess that St John 15 being one of my uh favorite uh ver uh passages in the Bible along with St John 17 St John 15 St John 17 two of my favorite passages in this in certainly in the gospels and so it's incredible to me that I've never done such a deep dive study on it as we intend to do today and perhaps we'll finish up uh the next time we're in the pull pit I definitely won't get to it all today I can already see that amen do you want what God has for you amen the enemy has uh struck me with quite a bit of anxiousness this morning I was asking even my wife on the way in to pray for me and she said 'why do you think it is I said 'I think it's the devil doesn't want this preached amen so uh we're just going to we're going to do the exact opposite of what he wants amen praise the Lord St John 15 verse one I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman husbandman is a Greek word that means Gardener or Farmer see so it's the it's all right I don't want to start preaching amen let's bow our heads Master we thank you now for your word I thank you for this assemblage of people who have come to hear the word of God today I pray you give us hearing hearts Lord W with with every ability that I have I have humbled myself in your presence over these last several days I've studied this thought so intently and and Lord is just probably because it's so close to my own own feelings and so I pray that you help me to express it honestly Lord with full uh complete transparency to show the people Lord that we truly are all in this thing together and it's one for all all for one Lord so now I pray you be our helper today I Know The Enemy doesn't want these truths brought out and Lord he's uh trying to afflict me but I'm I'm asking for your mercy today and I'm just going to relax myself in the Holy Spirit father and commit it to you now in Jesus name amen God bless your friends you can be seated amen let's brother Mark let's put that St John 15 up because I'm going to be be referring to it quite a bit I I I want to look at this as a as kind of a Bible study today the Lord being my helper I want to bring out some truths that have meant quite a bit to me and I'm imagining that it will mean quite a bit to you I want to talk today about abiding in Christ because and I want I want it to be I want to make just some qualifying statements you realize of course that we can look at any Scripture with compound meanings and brother brandham taught us this we can see that in the Bible very clearly one of brother branham's favorite examples to use was that in the Old Testament it referred it it it says that out of Egypt I have called my son and brother Branham uh would show as all Old Testament Scholars agree with that that was referring to Joseph and to Israel in a larger sense Israel my son I've called him out of uh Egypt we know that Joseph died there and his bones were kept there but he said don't leave my bones here when you leave here take me with you and so so we we realize that um that that also it had had a compound meaning because Joseph the the supposed father of Jesus the husband to Mary was warned uh by an a dream uh that he should take his child Jesus to Egypt to flee uh the decree coming forth and uh Satan was trying to kill the Son of God right when he was an infant and so he Herod was coming to get him and so the angel of the Lord said take him and flee to Egypt and that's why we get the confusion sometimes and it's it's ironic we'd be talking about it at this season but that's why that sometimes there's a misunderstanding that the wise men who came from the East who brought gifts that they came to the infant in the manger they did not the Shepherds saw that Mary saw that but the wise men found a 2-year-old child he was already a toddler a little boy boy and so because Joseph had fled to Egypt and then out of Egypt have I called my son so not only did it have an Old Testament rendering but it had a new testament rendering and it had a compound meaning and so when we look at this thought that I want to bring today brother brandham uh in a couple of and and more than a few places um talks about how that you know people who come to Christ and yet sometimes don't come all the way into Christ right and they you know he talks about Billy Graham complaining how that he said I I hold a meeting I get 30,000 decisions for Christ and when I come back in a year I can't find 30 Christian Believers still holding on to it so it went from 30,000 to 30 that's quite a depreciation and so and and Dr Graham blamed it on the local Ministry and on local Street Outreach and and the church is caring for people and visiting them now there's something to be said for that because that was one of the things that God took exception to the Pastors in the Old Testament he called them false pastors because they hadn't they hadn't cared about the people they didn't visit them they didn't talk to them they didn't associate with them and he said I'm going to tear you down I'm going to put a pastor over them that'll care about the people and meaning of course in the greater sense the Lord Jesus Christ the great Shepherd you you find that um in the Old Testament and so so we we we realize then that that when when we talk about a compound meaning you can you can look at St John 15 and brother brandham did take St John 15 and he talks about Abiding and and a lot of times the reason that people cannot abide in Christ is because first of all they've never fully come to him they have accepted him in a in a in in their intelligence but they've never come far enough to receive the the new birth which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost now the reason is very simple and very straightforward why that happens because we know in the scripture that the only requirement is to is to believe and to repent and when they asked Peter what shall we do they were they had believed his report they believed his indictment sermon and so they come forward like sometimes s people do uh come to the altar I've heard the sermon I I I want to repent I want to come to Christ and so what must we do you must repent see and so the problem be the Holy Ghost the new birth isn't difficult to get it it's promised to you your children them that are a far off but but but the prerequisite is a thorough full and complete unreserved surrender a complete unreserved repentance turning away from and going the other way I you know we see it so much in this day and time it's very prevalent in the day and hour that we live in you know I was just um watching a uh a reel the other day of a man testifying very very humble testimony very sincere it was moving even to me a very roughl looking fellow and uh very severe looking man but he was talking about how that he came to Christ and how that he said I was sitting in a church church and and he said I I I came I think a girlfriend or something had brought him and he said and I heard the preacher say you know that God loves you and he thought what me yes and God loves you just like you are you're kidding you're talking to me uh and God wants to bring you into himself and he'll forgive you of your sins and this man began to break down and begin to cry real tears and I they were genuine you could see that it was very sincere in it it was the problem that I had was that about every fifth word was a profanity and and even even ex even describing his experience and he he was saying you know I didn't know what the this that or the other and dropping all of these bombs and I just thought I felt compassion I felt sorry for the man I felt I felt somewhat of uh of consternation against the preacher who just never told him hey this is supposed to change your life amen it's not supposed to leave you like you are the whole beauty of the Holy Ghost is the lord loves you too much he does love you just like you are but he Le he loves you too much to leave you like you are see so you know we when we when we look at so brother Brandon would talk about people that don't come far enough but then there's also the aspect of and here's where my burden is today uh you know the the and I'm going to I'm going to run both sides for just a little bit in my Foundation uh so that we make a really good clear comparison uh but but I want you to know that my aim today is not primarily preaching to those who have never come far enough and they set as brother Brenham described they just set in church in VAR varying degrees of sanctification but they've never passed from Death un life and their life is up and down and in and out and on and off and that's not what a Believer wants that's not what I want I know that's not what you want you're not here to have that if you've got that today you've probably come here to lose that and leave it and leave here with a new life I certainly hope so but I want to focus today on those who truly have come to life I was so appreciating it never ceases to amaze me how the Lord leads the Sunday school teacher and it's so conducive to the to the thought I'm I was listening in the back to brother Matt's sermon the the the ones before that brother Caleb had my goodness it was so hand and glove and and that is not a new experience that happens so often that I that I'm not even surprised by it anymore I'm always grateful for it but I'm less and less surprised by it the Lord just seems to be doing things friends we're in a very treacherous hour we're in a very perilous time we don't exactly know we see a lot of things happening but I and I know we've heard that before and we've seen things before but I'm just here to tell you that in the in the in the triun that Trinity of of influence and anointing and power that's to strike the Earth at the end time would come together in a full triun of political power religious power and Demon power amen that's prophecy that's not something William brandom invented that's in the Bible so so we realize that we see things happening and it's it's hard to say I had a Minister asking me just yesterday do you do you think that that that that this is fulfilling this prophecy and what we see happening in Syria and it was prophesied there I think in Isaiah 17 uh how that Syria would be destroyed and how that the Gentiles who had rushed to its Aid would suddenly flee is is this speaking of Russia and Iran who have now deserted them is Syria about to be destroyed as a nation and so uh you know prognosticators and political and Talking Heads are filling the airwaves with it it's not surprising to me because I already had plenty of warning from the Lord that when I see these things I'm to lift up my head my Redemption draweth nigh and I'm here to tell you that the bride's presence in the earth the earth cannot go into a tribulation period although the vials have already partially unfolded we know that we've proven that but none of that can come to its fullness be so long as the presence of the Bride is in the Earth but I want to say to you today by way of stirring you up by way of reme of remembrance that the bride's presence in the Earth has an expiration date it has a shelf life and God's not going to leave it there longer than its expiration date the bride is going home amen and and and all of and and the and the lid being torn off of Hell under the fifth vial and fifth trumpet there at the beginning of the 20th century demon power streaming into the Earth hell has come to the surface and that's why you see the madness that you see in the streets and the insanity it's not an accident there are no accidents there are only God cidents so we find then that I want to speak today to those who have known the Lord and who do know him in the power and his power and his resurrection is that you today say I know him in the power and Resurrection I have I have experienced the Holy Spirit I am Born Again by the word of God so I'm speaking to you today in a compound way not on the side directly that those who have never come all the way but those who have but yet still find themselves under this word that you should abide in me he says here in our in our text I am the true V M and my father is the husbandman now excuse me so now Jesus is of course the True Vine I am the True Vine do you read it with me do you see that well then that proves all by itself that there is more than one Vine cuz he's the true one remember so if there's a true one there's a false one all right so I am the True Vine so you have Christ and you have Antichrist and that's not new that's been since Genesis Charles Larkin was well known for his many diagrams and drawings I have his writings and all of his works and his drawings are amazing they're quite detailed and you know he of course he didn't have it all correct but they're they're very helpful and in one of those early drawings Larkin coined the phrase Trail of the serpent and in his D it was it was in his diagram that tracked the the the seedline of Christ and the Antichrist through the scriptures as best as he could now naturally for lin uh you know um just just just as with Luther as with Wesley as with all the isua fathers and writers they lack the understanding to set it all back to its original teachings fully we know that uh none of them in fact is um none of them beginning from Luther and even coming up through the azuza Revival Lin included Arthur pink one of the most Brilliant Minds in the scripture uh wrote my favorite commentary book on the sovereignty of God a book brother brandham kept on his nightstand according to the testimony of Perry green my dad found that book loved it read it gave it to brother Perry who was his friend and brother Perry says Eddie I gave that book to offered it to brother brandham and he said he looked at it and said brother Perry I have this book it's on my nightstand I read in it nightly and so brother brandham had an exhaustive Library I have a list of all the books that he had and it's shocking and he read through all of them brother brandom though he had no formal education and certainly no theological training but he was a man very well read and had a great understanding and concept and so this is how he was able because he used the classical model which is reading and so so we realize that that they all lack the ability to bring it all in fact is none of them uh could see from Luther on none of them could see the doctrine of devils that was the Trinity it was three unclean spirits like frogs revelation 16 covers that how that and and and it's obvious now that that it was doctrinal teaching be the because that the three unclean spirits like frogs were doctrinal teaching it's obvious because it came out of the mouths of the Dragon the Beast and the false prophet so three frogs came out of three mouths preaching a three Trinity godhead and brother Bram said frogs looking back and they're always looking back to tradition so but the Bible goes on to tell us in the 14th verse there of of Revelation just keep me right there brother Mark for now but they tell us in the 14th verse of of Revelation 16 that it is these three unclean spirits like frogs that that are the doctrine of De there's the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth under the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to to gather them uh to the Battle of that great day of God Almighty verse 16 goes on to show us that he gathered him to together in a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon see so so we so so you know when I look at that I I think of here is is the here is the greatest existential threat to the human race that has ever existed I mean would is there anything a greater threat a greater existential Global humanwine event what would you put ahead of it see and yet this this greatest threat none of those mess MERS even with Lin coining the phrase Trail of the serpent coming all the way from Luther Wesley to the isua revivalist including Lin including pink including Spurgeon including Henry including all of them none of them understood the greatest existential threat and they believed in the Trinity and then you know you had because an Open Door got set at the end of Philadelphia after John went home um moving into the to the seventh age why brother Brandon would say the seventh Leo toan age in many respects at least the first part of it not the ending of it but the first part of it could in some respects be considered an extension of Philadelphia because that's where the open door was set which was a little bit more of a revelation and you began to get some Jesus name people but even they drove it into the left side ditch from the Trinity and the right side ditch and they just saw Jesus only this one saw three this one saw one and neither one of them saw the bride it took the opening of the seals to reveal that there was a book that a book of redemption that had names and God for 2,000 years had been filling the role of those names we are very privileged today friends right in the middle of it I I thought about this this morning as I was looking at that you know here you've got three unclean spirits like frogs they're coming out of the mouth of the Dragon they're coming out of the mouth of the Beast they're coming out of the mouth of the false prophet they're leading to the world to a Extinction event at Armageddon and right in the big middle of that in the 15th verse behold I come as a thief right in the middle of it right with it happening in real time he slips down and calls a bride out and perfects her by the word and slips her off of the earth see so so he he had made this statement you know in verse 15 and just keep me right there until I till I change your brother Mark he made the statement in that 15th verse behold I come as a thief Now Catch It blessed is he that WTH and keepeth his garments now he's talking to the bride he came as a thief in the m in the middle of all of that Ruckus he came as a thief while the world was being led arm again he slipped down like a thief and he says to the bride in that 15th verse blessed is he that WTH and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame that's to a Believer at least in a compound way amen we know the age was was naked but but he's now in a compound way the thief is coming because the thief is only coming to the redeemable that's why predestination that's why brother brandham talks about that that that that when we talk about Redemption that's only to the predestinated see so this thief that is coming to the predestinated he's saying to them make sure you're watching carefully make sure that you bride you Believers keeping your garments clean you wouldn't you don't we don't believe the word of God says things for no purpose it's certainly not redundant it doesn't say things for no purpose every even punctuation Jesus said not one jot or TI every word not not one word not even the punctuations of my word will pass away the Bible says that he values his word above his own name see because his name migrates his name he's he's been known by different names describing the characteristic of what he's doing at that hour see he was Elohim then he was he was he was Jehovah uh but but we also know that even within Jehovah there's compound Redemptive names he comes as Jesus and then in the new heavens and the new Earth he gets a new name so his name migrates according to his purpose but what doesn't change ever is his word it never changes he can't let it change if it if his word ever fails then he would cease to be God and have to surrender the throne to the enemy because the enemy be just as good as him all right all right so we find then that so watching and keeping our garments is vital amen Believers Believers watching Jesus told us to watch be ready in the hour you think not he comes so we're always to be watching we're always to be checking up keeping our garments spotless and clean I I can tell you that if there was ever a day that that's important it's now oh my friend you should you should be able to to see that a full understanding of the trail of the serpent was such a powerful point to be made and taught thoroughly to us it was so vital in fact uh that brother brandham himself was coming back to Jeffersonville to actually preach that sermon by that same title when he was taken from us in the restoring of the brid tree that had begun in Luther the progressiveness of Revelation uh that came to Lin was little more than a than a notation on a large model it's all it was he just had a he didn't even extrapolate it which you know if you if you look at his works and people want to try to claim you know where William Brandon got his revelation from goodness gracious if if you as I have have read larin's Works he covered the entire Book of Revelation and in a dozen or so Pages he covered it took me three years to go through the Book of Revelation working online every day teaching a class verse by verse he covered it in in a dozen or so Pages he covers the seventh seal in a page and a half so the idea that brother brandham got his his Doctrine from him is silly it is preposterously ridiculous it's just people who don't know amen they're just in ignorance and they don't know they don't want to know the truth um but they don't try to sell that to me they they they've tried that before and it doesn't work that's right so so we we realize then that that that what he because it was a progressive revelation and it it came to Luther it came to Wesley it came to Lin it came to Pink it came to to Seymour it came to uh uh Lake it came to Grant it came to those great men see and so but but in his in his great uh map of of the two Vines he just has a little small notation on this large model drawing and so brother brandham would bring out a much Fuller gravity of Satan's purpose and his plan for the end time fortunately uh even though he was called home he had already enlarged on the thought in several of his last sermons before being called home and this is why this is exactly why I believe that it was left as a main focus of the bride's Ministry to be able here at the end time because because the understanding of the trail of the serpent literally unlocks to us this great threat to civilization itself it is precisely why Satan fought so long to keep you from Christ he fought for years to keep you from Christ and now that he's lost that battle having now lost that battle he turns to keep you from abiding say what what you mean do I do I lose my new birth that's impossible he he tries to interrupt your fellowship with the holy spirit because this is the application of St John 15 to the believer abide in me me you can do nothing outside of me I'm the vine you're the branches brother brandham said the the life comes through the vine into the branches he says it's the branches that bear fruit it's the branches that are the show picture what he called it glad he didn't say picture show he said you are the show picture so the Lord took a selfie and it was you amen so so we know that it can't represent the loss of the new birth then it can only be the level of relationship that a born again believer is willing to maintain with Christ amen Here and Now friends already we are so deeply embedded into the 21st century we're already a quarter of the way through it and we see the receptiveness of Satan like never before do you what we see uh that you know appeared to brother brandham to be an impenetrable Darkness what seemed to him to be an unsurvivable Darkness but here we are that's right here we are that's right Hallelujah the very age that that Satan reaches his zenith and appearing as an angel of Light which if if you think about it that's an appearance as Christ that in many ways is very similar to the actual Christ and it's such a time of deception such a time of impossibility such a time of impenetrable darkness and unsurvivable darkness but you're surviving it's it can't be seen but you see it Hallelujah I'm still here I'm still a Believer I still see it that's right am Hallelujah so we realize then that when Satan reaches this climax according to the Lord Jesus when he prophesied of the hour that you live in there were many things that were said about the coming of this day there would be wars and rumors of wars but he said the end is not yet these things have to be the these are going to happen but there's coming a time where the days of Noah and the days of lot will be brought back to the Earth in a in a in a double barrel shotgun there will be a time that there will be many false prophets and there will be many false christs amen plural many false anointed ones there will be a time at the end yeah you're going to have wars and rumors of wars and you're going to have Nation against Nation uh but eventually it'll get to a point where it won't just be a nation against a nation it'll be a whole entire world war under the first wo under the second wo under the third wo and it and it's at all of this conglomeration of time all of these things that are happening in a lot of moving parts are going on in real time and here you are living in it and he said it would be a time that it would be so deceptive that it he's warning his family it would be so deceptive that it would deceive even my family if that were possible and he he would Jesus would say things like remember that I have told you before what I do now you don't understand but you'll know Hereafter and the Bible in the book of Acts said then they remembered his words oh I'm here to tell you something friends we have those moments where I remember what he said I remember what's in the message I remember what Jesus said I remember what Paul said I'm here this is it you're it it's an exciting time to be a believer it's a very sad time for the Earth because the gospel didn't come to save the world it came to save God's family out of the world the very same Jesus that that sent them out with the gospel told them the world is going to come to an end the same one that sent them out with the with the ministry of the holy spirit is the same one who described how it's going to come to an end so the gospel didn't wasn't never intended to say save the world from destruction it was to save God's family out of the world before its destruction am amen am I going too fast for you you with me so so we realize then that a an appearance of Christ that Jesus talks about so close would deceive the very elected a false Christ an appearance of Christ in the world at the end time uniquely without former precedent this is something coming at the end time many things I've went down the list with you many times showing you the uniqueness of the hour that we live in that it's unparalleled in history all the way back to Genesis it's unparalleled the closest you'd get is the days of Enoch but even the days of Enoch only had to deal with the day of lot I mean the day of Noah it have to deal with lot like you have to deal with Noah and lot so Jesus prophesied that there would be an appearance of an antichrist that in many ways would be very similar to the actual Christ Jesus said I am the True Vine so then there's got to be a a a false Vine see so we realized then there that there would come in the last day now it wouldn't just be it wasn't that it would only come in the last day it actually came in the early church a false word but by the end time it would reach its climax it would reach a Zenith it would reach its Pinnacle see so that it would be so close it would deceive the very elected that's a you that's a unique warning for the end time Paul talks about perilous times shall come it wasn't that they didn't have perilous times in their day but it's pointing to a time when it would be as brother Brandon would would describe impenetrable Darkness see in his interview there in South Africa just he thought no one could survive it and we can't but he can but I'm here to tell you if you're going to survive it if you're going to be a Survivor if you're going to wear a t-shirt in glory that says I survived Leo deia you're going to need to abide in him amen amen so we find that it was told it would be a Christ in many ways so similar to the actual Christ a a different word similar to the real word so similar in fact that it can be as much as 90 99% identical to the pure original word and still be poisoned am I right right or wrong that's that's what happened in Eden see it creates as Paul labeled this Antichrist Paul labeled him in 2 Corinthians 11:4 so you just make a note of that if you want to keep a note I'm having the team leave that up there for now but but Paul labeled this Antichrist in 2 Corinthians 11:4 Paul called it another Jesus amen similar to the real Jesus but who is not the beginning of the creation of God rather he is a perversion of that original creation and that is precisely why a faith hear me that is precisely why a faith uh that is not you know that that is not based on the pure word cannot produce the token on display in your lives amen that now we're not saying the middle the middle of the ages brother bam said don't say Luther didn't have the Holy Ghost don't say he wasn't saved he did and he was but the but the token the full token on display cannot come to the end time because the full token on display is the whole word revealed believed accepted eaten you've eaten the book you've become the book you're prophesying what you've eaten what's and you comes out of you see so so there there's no way then that that you could have uh uh a faith um that is not based on the pure word there's no way for it to produce the token because the to and listen the token on display is necessary for the rapture so Paul called it there in 2 Corinthians 11 for if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted all right so one of what that's just one of several labels for the Antichrist he there are other labels that him and other disciples used the man of sin the deceiver the false prophet and here in second Corinth an another Jesus one to be worshiped like God because this this was Satan's ambition having at one time Stood Beside Christ in the eternities and so he wanted to be like God his ambition was to be like God that is to say another Jesus now realizing that he could not create God had not given him that power he had no chance to accomplish his goal except he started he he went to God's family he went to Eve and started giving her a false word a poisonous word that was 99% true and he says his lie was you'll be like God see so he's you understand that he's trying to ascend or he's trying to have rulership in Christ by having a a kingdom of his children around him his impersonation of the word uh produces Christians soall or labeled as such but they bear uh because and the reason that they would be called Christians is because they they definitely uh bear similarities in greater and lesser degrees to a true Christian believer sometimes in ways that are nearly equal to or goodness gracious in some cases even appear to exceed uh a a True Believer sometimes living more holy than the word even calls for so Jesus says I am the True Vine okay I'm GNA have to finish reading my opening text here I'm never going to get to my main thought amen don't get scared I'm getting ready to close I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman so so then all right now what you've just proven to yourself when you read that with me is you've proven that it's going to take more than God in the Sun at Calvary to fully redeem you I am the vine my father is the husbandman so it's going to take more than just God in the son at Calvary to fully redeem you your journey didn't end at Calvary it began at Calvary it's also taking the working of the husbandman which is God in the form of the Holy Ghost to finish the job and return you back to Perfection to get you home to get me home that's what we want amen hallelujah all right every Branch verse two brother Mark every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring bring forth more fruit I'm not going to do a breakdown of these verses and bear in mind that there's compound meanings you know because we know that a Believer can't be lost he's passed from Death To Life St John 5:24 assures us of that so so so so don't get all confused and thinking in the wrong the wrong side of of a compound meaning so he says here three now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you verse four abide in me to Believers to Believers ye are clean through the word which I have spoken to you now abide in me and and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me so it's not a Prohibition to bearing fruits the false Church Bears fruits but not fruits unto salvation and Redemption they're not true they're they're they're not authentic they're hybrid you understand they're hybrid now the best evidence you have of that is that at the Judgment bar in Matthew 25 those people attempt to stand on their Works look at what we've done they're they're standing on their fruits look have we not done this and that and this and that and I've said to you many times it doesn't surprise me that they would try to do that they spent their whole Christian Life doing that trying to prove to the world that they were a Christian because they built hospitals orphanages and had s Light TV and preached on radio around the world and sent Bibles everywhere well and fine and good nothing to say against those things and that that's what brother Brandon would constantly emphasize said I'm not against those things not against program not against all that he says I'm just saying that it you've got to come back to the original word and let the word bring fruits in your life let the that's what Jesus said by the word I have given you see verse five he says it again as if it's not already important I am the vine yes Lord we know you've already told us that but I want you to catch it I know you're born again of my spirit I know you have a gene of God I know you love me I know you believe my word but I need to tell you twice abide in me I am the vine and brother brandham talks about how that the vine life is what flows into the branches amen I am the vine verse 5 ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing so if you're not bringing forth much then you might as well not be bringing forth anything he doesn't give a middle one there's not a a a curtain be it's you bring you let you let me Purge you so you bring forth more fruit much fruit remember that was the problem with the seed that fell by the wayside the fouls of the air picked it up some of it f that's demon Spirit you come into church you hear the gospel it means nothing to you it blesses the people all around you to you it's nothing okay thank you it's nice to be here today I appreciate all that singing you leave and it means nothing and the Very word you heard the demons come and take it right out of your mind and you go on your life as if nothing as if you'd never been here Jesus talked about that that's not the person I want to be I I I don't want to be that guy amen neither do I want to be the one where seed fell by the wayside you get allused and excited and and you're so glad that he can forgive your sins and you feel pretty dirty rotten and you you're glad that somebody could forgive your sins and God loves me just the way I am and I don't really have to change what a deal I I get to go to heaven I don't have to actually live like Christ because he did it all at calary and I got nothing to do that's nonsense that's not the gospel that's a go that's a that's another Jesus that's another word that's similar to the word see so so he's he goes on verse six if a man abide not in me is cast forth as a branch and his withered don't forget we've got compound meanings I'm not here to break it all down some of this applies to people who have never come to to a new birth and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned and so you know could I make this comment because it's not in my notes but it comes to my mind that even when Paul is talking about members of God's actual family preachers in particular and not just preachers but anybody because you're all you're all ministers see you just may not do it behind a pull pit but you're called to be to let your light shine Jesus said to the whole church go into all the world and demonstrate the gospel and Paul talks about people who build on wood hay and stubble instead of building on gold and precious stones gold and silver and precious stones gold and silver and precious stones instead they build on mental uh thoughts and ideas and visions of their own they never let the Holy Spirit really get them over their eye disease it's all about them and it's all about building a kingdom it's all about controlling people and you know there's there's even times when God's family members can refuse to let the Holy Spirit deliver them from complex refuse to let the Holy Spirit deliver them from hurts and wounds and they don't forgive and they run and I'm talking about God's family and and preachers can get like that and they never actually get past any of that stuff and I'm here to tell you here's the thing they suffer all their work and all of their effort is consumed by the Judgment fires of the earth it would discourage me if I didn't see the Holy Spirit living inside you it would discourage me if I didn't see you coming from Death to life and to see you rising up in faith then I know that my Ministry is being effective to have it all come down and and the age becomes so wicked that all of y'all backslide and my Ministry and everything that I built just goes up in Flames see cuz I build on wood hay and stubble verse seven if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will this is where you operate third pole see so as I've said to you before when I'm teaching on the third poll the third poll we found we found that perfect Faith didn't we friends we studied it intricately we took many many many many sessions on that many many sermons and we prove to you unequivocally that the that perfect Faith to operate the third pole is not something you go get it's something you prepare yourself to receive it's it's coming it's here Among Us already because God said it would be here it's operating because he said this is what it'll do and it's doing it I'm not waiting on another messenger another age or another this or another Super this or super that we already have the revealed word we have the Holy Spirit moving Among Us the power of God and the power of the Resurrection it all comes down to are you willing to abide see if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done to you do you think if verse seven wasn't true about William brandham he could have created squirrels twice do you think if verse seven didn't apply to William brandham he could have spoke a storm out of existence do you think he could have gave a dead fish back his life do you think he could have disappeared a tumor from his wife just by speaking it do you think he could have given hadie right the salvation of her children if verse seven hadn't been true in his life I'll tell you it wouldn't have it couldn't have see would he have been a believer of course Born Again sure Prophet absolutely but verse S has to be in play friends verse eight explains it herein is my father glorified if you're willing to obey verse seven then verse eight can be true herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples look at the qualifications to being a disciple you're abiding in Christ Christ is abiding in you you've shut out the world you've you've hid yourself away in the Holy Spirit you're a Third Realm dweller you're you're in the you're Beyond the Veil you live in the Holy of holies you're eating out of the golden pot of Mana Hallelujah Aaron's Rod is there and budding and blossoming that's what your life is about your life isn't filled with with anguish and anxiety and stress your life isn't filled with the poisons of of of Revenge and the hurt and the and the complexes get let go of that stuff come into Christ and he'll Purge you of all of it brother brandham went on down I'm not going to get to it today I'll have it for the second part brother brandham just makes it so clear he said you've just watched too much TV and too much Hollywood and too much of this has affected your life he's talking to believers who have no power of God in their life but they're actually our Believers verse 9 verse 8 here in as my father glorify that you bear much fruit and so shall you be my disciples verse 9 as the father hath loved me me here's how it works so have I loved you continue ye in my love how did Jesus demonstrate his love to the father he did always that which pleased him verse 10 if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you hear the words of the Lord Jesus the whole reason I'm telling you these things is that so that my my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full so maybe you've got joy that's not full but the promise is he wants you to Bear much fruit and be his disciple and bring glory to God and your joy I here to tell you friends there's no joy in the world like knowing that you're pleasing to the Lord there's no anguish for a Believer so strong as to know when you when you know your prayer life isn't where it ought to be and your church attendance isn't where it ought to be and your love for the people and your love for the word and your prayer life and your Bible reading and your tape listening when you know those things are lacking you don't have full Joy there's no way you do if you think you do it's because you've never tasted the full Joy because you don't know what you don't have abide in me you can take it down brother Mark see here's the goal here's the goal I'm going to give you the goal of God brother Brandon talks about how that all through the Bible God only ever had one goal and he expresses it in multiple ways but everything was aiming to one purpose and that was to express himself see it's all about expression everything he did was about expr expression Abel caught a revelation of a lamb because that expressed the blood sacrifice and how that Redemption laid in the blood Amen on and on and on we could go through the life of Abraham Enoch built that pyramid for the same reason it was a revelation of God so that something we would have a marker to go wow we're we can actually make it into a Rapture how do you know cuz somebody already did and even have the Holy Ghost like I've got if he did it what can we do so brother brandham breaks it into three phases first to express himself completely God in Christ what all the prophets priests and kings were about it's what all the sacrifices were about to express himself completely in Christ and when Christ hung on the cross and said it is finished all the way till his last breath and when that not until then when that last breath and he gave up the ghost the expression of God was made complete see second to have his pinenes this is during the church ages from Ephesus through Leota to have the pinenes by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them that's what the Holy Ghost is given for see and third here here it is to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them fellowshipped with them could I say abided with them and they with himen this is what he's coming back to friends and when the last believer has belied the last word and overcome the last victory and the bride is lifted from the earth then then the then phase number two is complete and the phase number three is underway we're restored back we come back to the Earth in a millennium we have a marriage supper three and a half years while the world there's a reward ceremony there's all kinds of things that are going to go on there and then we're coming back here to set up a millennial reign with the with the king for a thousand years all right now I want to I want to come down to H I won't even get that far let me just come down to this point you good many have taken the brave step to accept Christ to believe his word for this hour and stand today with a a hand of witness I am a believer I have received him the word whom God hath sent remember it was not a prophet that gave you the the the the open book it was Christ he only used a prophet because that's how he rolls that's how he works that's how he does it that's what's up that's how God does it he uses prophets to do that you should thank God that he does never used intellectual men they always mess it up he uses prophets who don't know anything see many have taken the brave step to accept this word to accept Christ to accept the true word in their life yet too often we as a pastor I hear such such feelings of disappointment in people I have them myself when I go to prayer you have them now I'm going to really get down to your address friends We're All in This Together amen okay it can be very disheartening when the when the joy and the blessings of the Lord that you once felt seem to fade over time often too often times leaving sometimes leaving God's Born Again family to question their experience question their very experience or or at the least you know why your experience with such a lovely Lord Jesus uh hasn't been as fulfilling as you had hoped and Satan can take you down a road of inadequacy and you wonder why the Lord called you at all amen wondered why why did he call me in the first place and many times friends if it wasn't for my firm belief in a first place oh Hallelujah if it wasn't that I knew that there was a first place if it wasn't that I knew that that that that that the many times that I've that I've had to face or that you have faced impossible discouragement and I'm not even prone to discouragement because I I know I love God and I know I'm I believe his word and I I know I was there's a first place and I was in it and I and I and I maybe I haven't reach that goal and I thought uh my my Christian Life should be more than this and it should accomplish more than it has accomplished and we can always feel those kinds of feelings of of of inadequacy come on I can't be the only one here today this is a dark hour this is impossible odds we're we're under an onslaught like the world has never seen and that's why you you hear the words of the Lord to you today you need to abide in me and I in you if it wasn't for my firm belief in that first place my sometimes we find ourselves and if you're honest you'll know that I'm talking to you are not me but the Holy Spirit you're very grateful deep in your heart you are you are for real you're very grateful for the word that he's revealed to you and you believe it and and and you long for more of it is amen you see and not only do I long for more of it I I long for victory in it but too often you find yourself coming up heartbreakingly short of the glory of God on a glory may I say that he so richly deserves and you know it you like me painfully know it I want to say to you today by the anointing of the Holy Spirit upon me it's important for you to understand that this is not a true reflection of your your Worth to him nor is it a true reflection of your faith in him I want to give you this assurance today that he who begun a good work in you he will finish it he will finish it he's finishing it today the holy spirit is reaching out to prick your heart today to say son daughter it's not that you don't believe me I know you believe me I know you love me but you need to abide in me this is why I warned you abide in me and I in you so that you may do that which pleases the father stand to your feet today friends how many want to please the father you want to say like Jesus I do always that which pleases the father oh Lord God today with our hands lifted up today Lord God I'm so glad to know you'll finish this I'm so glad to know you haven't left me here without a solution I'm so glad to know Lord God that you love me in these ways you care about me Lord Jesus you care about your family you care about us one and all you you called us Lord you you didn't waste your time you didn't waste your energies to call us to this wonderful life with all heads bowed and All Hearts closed amen Tony would you sing some more of that of sister Brenda Song you were singing amen just uh slow it down a tad and make it a little more worshipful as I was listening to brother Tony sing that I thought my I'm going to have him sing that wherever I end up in my sermon today I didn't know where I would end up all heads bowed all heart eyes closed Lord so much more to say feels like that I barely just did get to my main thought and now constraints of Time Lord and I wouldn't have to close these people would keep right on listening but I don't want them to lose it I I don't want to overs sponge them I want their hearts and Minds to be full of what this thought is today and I feel in my heart by the acknowledgement of your spirit that enough has been said Lord there's more we'll say and more we'll hear but sufficient for the day is what we've heard now I pray master that the words that have been heard will Echo long Lord in the canyons of their soul all through the remainder of the day and this evening and tomorrow and days to come that they'll have a deeper desire desire Lord and the these words that they heard will come back to their mind you said what I do now you know not but you'll know Hereafter may it be so Lord God may it come in such a way that there's such a sufficiency of strength in it that it will lift us up above the shadows of this broken world this broken sad world there's a new one coming I'm so glad for that I'm so glad this is not all there is sometimes the unbeliever becomes so discouraged they take their own life they they chase everywhere and they can never find true joy and true happiness but we have found the pearl of great praise we have found you in your word today you rescued us Lord when we it was so unnatural to us because our our fallen nature would have never agreed with your word but that Supernatural power of God came down broke our heart entered in we love you Lord I know today Lord God that this church is filled with people and out across the airwaves we've got we've got regrets of Plenty for all of our mistakes
