========================================

there is that we hear the word Holiness and we have a reaction and uh we have to make sure that that reaction is scriptural and many and that's that's in any in any teaching and anything that's what we have to do I think there's certain topics that you can look at and say maybe more so for others but it's across the board for anybody you you may have a bad Church experience you may have may have had a super uh righteous so-called uh people not really but that's how we would term it that are breathing down your throat and constantly trying to force you into their mold and their shape of what they think is the most important things if you follow these outward things then you are achieving holiness and I I think it's it's key from the scripture that we just read that we need to follow we need to pursue Holiness without that no one will see the Lord but without a right understanding of Holiness and what that means how can we pursue it first chronicles 16 verse 29 give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come before him Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness a lot of different translations bring that word beauty and instead of seeing Beauty they say splendor it's an interesting word if you look up the history of this word in ancient Hebrew it's it's very strange I don't want to get into that but let's just say that this word splendor or beauty means a whole lot more than what we look at it at just first glance it speaks of brightness it speaks of Brilliance it speaks of Supremacy um I'll leave it at that this this Holiness if we don't understand holiness with this added to it we're mistaken there's a brightness and there's a Brilliance there's a Supremacy there's a beauty there's an awesomeness to holiness First Peter 1 15 and 16 but as he which hath called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy and we can all recall in Isaiah chapter 6. where the cherubims cover their face and cover their feet and they with two more Wings they fly and what is their what is their song that they sing holy holy holy is the Lord Almighty the whole earth is full of his glory three times holy it's speaking of he's infinitely holy so what does holy mean it simply means to be set apart another way you could say to be different when you talk about for us Sanctuary the act of making us holy is to be cleansed and set apart for service but the word Holiness is a is a word simply you're set apart for God but really it it's way more than that so much more than that it's that's such a simple statement set apart God is set apart so you be set apart what does that look like I found a couple quotes from writers that I thought expressed this idea well JC Ryle writes holiness is the habit of being of one mind with God according as we find his mind described in scripture it's a habit of agreeing in God's judgment hating what he hates loving what he loves and measuring everything in this world by the standard of his word all right C.S Lewis writes this if we let him for we can prevent him if we choose he will make the feeblest and filthy of us into a dazzling radiant Immortal creature pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine a bright stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly though of course on a smaller scale his own boundless power and delight and goodness so when God is we seek that God is Holy we're not speaking of something that should make us go oh man that's boring you know Holiness is boring no Holiness that word holy should strike such an awe in your heart it's understanding that God is other he's different than this world but then don't stop there because he says you be the same he made you and His Image and likeness that's such a because he wants us to express him those things become such trite words sometimes what does that actually mean well we want to have the Life of Christ in us what does that mean you are going God is shaping you and forming you into a being of splendor you yourself are being shaped and he is bringing us to this purpose and in many ways you already are that you're already reflecting that there is a sinful nature that we're biting fighting against probably biting against too one that we're fighting against and battling against but in inside of that beyond that there is a being of light and energy and power and wisdom and love that's seeking to Break Forth from you that is so incredible that if we actually saw ourselves we might be tempted to Fall Down and Worship foreign think about that for a minute the the incredible Glory that he's called us to and what kind of person you're going to be a person that speaks and everything stops why because of your connection with him before the foundation of the world he's chosen you you're a part of his life a part of his being something inside of you that doubt deep down the inside of the inside on the soul it's there and the new birth comes the Holy Spirit comes and that life begins to be Unleashed and something is going to be born it's like a it's like a a caterpillar you look at it it's it's not beautiful it's something that we maybe look at and disdain but we carry in our minds that's gonna go into a cocoon and it's going to come forth as something Grand and beautiful that can just lift itself on the Wind and that's what God is doing in US ultimately we're not going to get there until we have that new body right but we're at the same time we're already there by the new birth you can identify you've heard from your theophany right before the foundation of world there's a there's a body that you have that's Eternal in the heavens second Corinthians chapter five we have a building from God a house stop made with hands Eternal in the heavens and it's a body that's incredibly glorious and it is radiating the Brilliance of God through it see I don't feel that I don't think that I don't care what you feel we're talking about what the word says that's what God is shaping you into because that's what he created you to be a perfect reflection what is a reflection God looking in the mirror when he looks in the mirror that reflection is you that is what that is what he's made you to be so when you think about a holy life don't just think about man I got a lot of rules to follow I shouldn't have a TV I shouldn't watch this I shouldn't do this I shouldn't do this it's not a negative that we're trying to express it's a positive that God is trying to manifest through us and let that positive life dictate and direct how you live that's what between what uh C.S Lewis is saying and what JC Ryle is saying you'll get the picture this is not a drudgery to be holy is not a drudgery it's it's not a list of rules it's who you who he makes you to be I want to be careful and make that distinction it's not merely who you are because we can look at that and see our own sinfulness our own weakness but it's who he has designed us to be we fell that's what Redemption was for that's why Christ came and shed his blood to restore us back to the original purpose God had in making us to make us beings of light and Splendor and glory and Power hahaha God has called us to live a holy life this kind of life like I said it's not a negative it's a positive it's not drudgery it's not continual sorrow it's joy in the midst of Trials and troubles and pain I don't know who I was speaking to Brother Brad I think it was yesterday about Joy Joy is is like something that you can't really grab your grab a hold of it's something that God brings into your life it's not happiness because you can have joy when there's tears coming out of your eyes when you're feeling great pain and you're suffering and dealing with with heartache you can feel Joy what is it I don't know what it is it's the presence of God it's his love it's something that sweeps over you that you say I want to live in this eternally I don't ever want to leave this thing and God says but you can only have it in part now you're going to have it in fullness when you come over here with me but I'm giving you a foretaste we've all had that experience where you see something or you experience something or you're in a place in nature and joy comes over you you I I don't maybe you haven't but I've had it where I've been so sorrowful and in pain and suffering over something that I'm going through and the joy of the Lord sweeps over and tears come and thankfulness and gratefulness come over me that's Joy that and Holiness is much like that Holiness is not a mere feeling it's not based on how you feel but it's him sweeping over you and using you and moving through you and shaping his life in you it's uh it's you and yet it's other than you it's different it's distinct from you this isn't a life that says you know the the the the New Age movement is out there trying to mimic with false teaching what the Bible teaches about Who We Are your gods you're you just have to recognize that spark of Life of who you are but what is it it's all Pride it's self-pride there's no room for that a person who is truly holy is humble he recognizes that this is not of himself this is from God to us as a great gift so real and real recognition of the power of Who We Are in him would lead us to a life of self-examination before God's Throne wouldn't leave us to justify ourselves well I'm the I'm this so I can live any way I want you can but you better be careful because the any way you want will Express what Life Source you're coming from the life that he places in US is a life that is so earnestly and continually Desiring and and and and like a mother giving birth seeking that kind of life to be birthed in us on a daily basis a life that follows hard after the word to be cleansed from all worldliness from all ungodliness anything contrary to the message that would be the heart's desire of this holy person Matthew 16 24. then she said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me you can get this verse and you could say what a hard pill to swallow what a bitter route to chew on take up your cross deny myself follow me but for a believer who is participating in the life of Jesus this isn't a Bitterroot it's not a hard pill to swallow is it difficult is it all life-consuming absolutely but it's not a hard pill to swallow it's our great Delight it's our joy it's our passion that's the root of Holiness we've forsaken everything to follow Jesus we have seen a person not a set of rules not a set of facts we have met a person and he's shall displayed himself to us and revealed himself to us personally and that we desire to give everything of ourselves to him everything that we have need of and he is infinitely worthy of our worship and submission so we with delight forsake all to follow him were set apart from this world unto Jesus a person not a set of rules not a lifestyle to live not the message Doctrine were set aside to live for a person we're not pursuing Holiness as an end in itself we are pursuing a person that loves us beyond all measure that has called us to forsake all and that he himself has forsaken all himself in order to win us in order to save us and so this is beyond so far beyond Holiness is not a set of rules it's not well if I if my dress my if my skirt is so long well let's debate about it how long should your skirt be that's not what this is this is a life of holiness this is being set apart to a person and he leads and he guides and he teaches and he show he shows you and he convicts you are we are we so dull that we're seeking after living a life of rules and not offending people that's what our Des that's what our hearts desire and our greatest passion is not offending people come on get saved get saved meet Jesus it's not about following a set of rules it's about living your life so for the mo the loveliest most awesome incredible person in the world Psalm 63 look at David this is not a life of drudgery to a set of rules oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee this is this is what's birthed in a believer that's seeking after holiness early will I seek thee my soul thirst for thee my flesh Longs for the in a dry and thirsty land where no water is one Pursuit one desire not six not two not three when you're looking for water you're not worried about if the mortgage is going to be paid you're not worried about anything besides one thing and that's I'm seeking for water if I don't get water I'm dead okay this is David's heart towards God I'm looking for you my my longing is for you my one great passion is for you for what verse 2. to see thy power and thy Glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary a living God true and living God not a statue not an idol not a mental conception but he's looking for a living manifested God verse 3 because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee so this is the reason for his Pursuit that is the reason for David's Pursuit is because God's love and kindness is better than this human life all the things that we have in it the good times the bad times the suffering the thing that everybody's trying to avoid is dying right they're trying they're trying to stay alive they're pursuing Staying Alive and David says you know what God's love is better than that and he says my lips shall praise thee verse 4 thus will I bless thee will I live I will lift up my hands and thy name this is Seeking a life of holiness all right this this is this is a heart set on fire and passion for God that's what's seeking a life of Holiness is my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips amen so if you're if you're if you're having a if you're you're eating a diet that's low in fat your soul won't be satisfied your flesh won't be satisfied so we want to be as Christians we want to be eating marrow and fatness something that has sustains and strengthens life joyful lips amen Joy think about what I mentioned before about Joy the importance of that seeking after joy seeking after joy is what seeking after God you can't create joy in yourself God does that inside of you when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches I might because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings in your presence will I rejoice my soul follows hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth thee me so he says early will I seek thee and then he says in my on my bed and in the night watches will I meditate this is someone who is continuously all day seeking after God you know we we can claim I don't smoke I don't drink I don't curse I I don't wear makeup sisters I don't cut my hair uh you can go on and on over the list of things that you don't do and those things can then become matters of pride self-pride self-justification I don't do this I don't do that therefore I'm okay this is not the kind of Life of Holiness that God's calling us to again that's the that's looking at the negative looking at the negative that we're avoiding is pride the purpose of God is not for us to avoid things he's not coming in and saying Hey I want you guys to be miserable I want you to have a horrible life because you have to avoid everything no he's asking us and telling us find your joy in me recognize who I am and recognize that I'm trying to make you like me and there's a transforming power and of course God has a standard God has Allah God has God has many things in the New Testament that he tells you if you do this you're not going to the kingdom of God but again this is not to be pursued like the Jews pursued the law too many times this happens in Christian circles because we know the standard then the standard then becomes a law and it becomes follow this do this do this do this and I'm okay with everybody but are you okay with God that's what's most important why are we looking at are we okay with everybody just go find a movement where you can be everything's okay if that's your attitude we're looking and seeking after God that's the purpose and and the the things that are written are written by by Paul and the apostles to demonstrate this is the kind of life that Christ lives through his people this is the kind of Holiness that comes into a person from God and is manifested in their life so therefore you could see if this is happening and this is happening and this is happening it shows that Christ is not in you right that's that's the vision that God has for his people in this day it's not a list and set of rules the standard has been restored by the word we know the standard I'm not up here telling you we don't need a standard what I'm telling you is if you don't pursue it right you're not experiencing God's salvation God's salvation is his Spirit coming into living in you you'll find quotes brother Branham says none of us are holy it's the Holy Spirit living inside of us and changing us and making us into that CR that that that that son or daughter that God had in his mind before the very foundation of the world amen all right I'm out of time let's stand and pray gracious father we come to you now Lord and our desire is to enter into the Vision that you had of us before the foundation of the world Lord that we would be holy even As You Are Holy and that we would see what that the beauty and Grandeur and Majesty of what Holiness really is and that you are seeking to place those same uh titles and attributes upon us and in us and through our lives help us to enter into that Vision Lord of the word let us lay aside the things that are trying to beset us and and pull us aside let us not look to the negative and see I'm not doing this I'm not doing that but let us look to you and say Lord bring bring your life in me more and more that I would be an expression of of your holiness Lord we will commit ourselves and commit the service commit each one into your hands use us For Your Glory we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you
