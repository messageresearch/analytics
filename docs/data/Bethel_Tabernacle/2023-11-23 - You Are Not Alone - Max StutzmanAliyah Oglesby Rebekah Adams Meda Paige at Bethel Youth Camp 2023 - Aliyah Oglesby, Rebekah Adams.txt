TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] no one seems to understand the battle in your mind or how your heart just can't break one more time so when you don't seem to understand the master or his plan just be still and hear him gently say You are not alone can't you f me hold you if my hurt a but be still my child and know you are not alone can't you see I love you and if you come rest in me no one can harm you you're not [Music] alone no one seems to understand the mountain that you climb or how your we Soul can rest or sleep at night so when you don't feel strong enough to answer to his call just be still and hear him say you are not not alone can't you feel me hold you my hurt a while but be still my child and know you are not alone can't you see I love you and if you come and rest in me no one can harm you you're not [Music] alone you're not alone in your Valley you're not alone in your fears and though the storm might not pass quickly you'll be there to dry your tears you're not alone in your Valley you're not alone in your fears and the storm might not quickly he'll be there to dry your tears you're not alone in your Valley you're not alone in your fear and the stor might not quickly be there to draw your [Music] tears You Are Not Alone can't you feel me hold you it might hurt a while but be still my child and know you are not alone can't you see I love you and if you con rest in me no one can har you you're not alone you're not [Applause] [Music] alone you're not [Applause] alone
