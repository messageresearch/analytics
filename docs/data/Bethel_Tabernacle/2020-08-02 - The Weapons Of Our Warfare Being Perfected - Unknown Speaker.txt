========================================

so good morning god bless you let's look right into the scripture this morning our familiar reading in revelation chapter one amen we're trying to get a um connection over in the house guys and it's not working that computer won't connect so davey's going to need that this morning so if that could get resolved i apologize for coming in late i was over there trying to do it myself the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw praise the lord may the lord bless the reading of his word this morning now we've been looking at these verses and we want to try to make our way through this first verse it's vitally important as we've been stressing that we get the understanding of the revelation of jesus christ and what he's meaning now there's two parts to that and let me just say um as i'm leading in i've been backing up a little bit and rehearsing but you have the archive and uh so i only have a 25 minute class so i don't want to keep backing up and recovering stuff we have the archives and i want to keep moving on i want the first thing i want to notice this morning in our reading is that in that very first verse there's two uh what would i call maybe uh two angles of looking at that to maybe a compound meaning and that is that what is the understanding of jesus christ and who he was and what was his relationship to the father how do we explain his humanity and his deity being uh together in one vessel and that's exactly what he was he was a hundred percent of both he was uh the god man and uh you can't really attribute him and you can't use any other model in scripture perfectly because he's the first of this brand new type of person he's the first he's the beginning of this creation he's the only begotten of the father and that's going to give him unique qualities and we're we've talked about that extensively teaching on the godhead but i want to uh catch the second angle to look at when you read the verse the revelation of jesus christ that you want to realize that since the term revelation is apocalypse and apocalypsis and and that greek word means an uncovering or an unveiling or let me give you this word unfolding just like it's it's held in scrolls and when the seals are broken the scrolls are un unwound and in this case that we're finding that jesus himself is becoming identified the the revelation of jesus christ is not merely who he was as the god-man though that's a very fundamental part of it but it is describing to you what what god is doing in jesus christ in the ages to come we made the statement to you last time that the revelation of jesus christ that we read in the book of revelation this is the this is the unfolding or the uh continuation of his future work which is not the work of the nail scarred man that body as we've said lays as an atonement for us on the altar of god so it's not the body of the nail scarred man that in that office he completed his earthly assignment on the cross he said it is finished and indeed the purchase price for his family in redemption was finished he never has to come back and go to calvary again he died once for sin the bible says and neither do i have to go to calvary because by the holy ghost i'm identified in christ as going to calvary with him and i was literally within him and so we it we're not talking about that it's not a continuation of the work of the lamb we're not saying it's not a continuation of the logos in fact it is both of those it is the continuation of the lamb of god the intercessor the the the redeemer our savior the logos that god that was the form god was in when he created the world so it's still the work of the lamb all the way to the millennium he is forever our intercessor and thanks be to god and so we realize that what is he doing in the book of revelation the revelation of jesus christ is describing his continuing work but now in a new body which is the church all right so we realized that he finished the work of redemption at calvary paying the price now the the full work of redemption still has to have a claiming part that's going to happen at the end time and we're not rushing ahead to that we'll get to it as we go along in our study but what you see here in this term the revelation of jesus christ is that is that now he is going to do uh he accomplished the father's will in his nail-scarred body but now he's going to bring forth the second eve because because he's doing it in eve uh so so you've got to keep that in mind it's not jesus with the nail scarred hands that body was the word made flesh amen and so this is christ the logos the continuing of the word and it's now christ in his church a new body all right that's important a new body working all the way through the book of revelation that's what the book of revelation is about is the continuing work of christ in a body so christ in you in that new form the logos so he finishes his work as a in redemption to purchase and the scripture calls him the last adam in that regard so he's going to do the work now in the book of revelation to recreate the last eve the whole program of god is to take adam and eve back to eternity again those are important points so he unveils himself through the church ages he displays his attributes that's what the world is seeing he has revealed himself and that's what the revelation is all about he's revealed himself in his attributes now we realize that that when it comes down uh to what the scripture describes in about the body of christ or the second eve is we find that uh several things we find that we are a mini membered body and so when when jesus is coming to bring this revelation to john he's saying look john you know me you saw me you lived with me you walked with me and now what what you're about to see is the same me but i'm gonna be it's gonna be me in you on the earth and that's why the apostle would say that you are written epistles seen and read of all men and and basically paul is is saying in the in the thus saith the lord coming from christ your written epistles peter deals with this that you are lively stones and that that your that god is saying to you your written epistles in other words you're me in the earth i was in that body now i'm in your body that was me now you're me all right and that is the idea that we get in the mini membered body and so we realize that that the revelation of jesus christ is the fullness of the godhead bodily on earth again this is in fact the whole plan of god is to work this program that the the word which is living out now it's further part which is jesus because the bible shows us that jesus is the name of the word jesus is the name of the word we read that in ephesians 3 9. so when we come to this we're beginning to talk about the principle now of the book of revelation and and this is a bright age we call it a bright age we call it the bride's book because this this was a beginning in the alpha age and the the bible talked about how it would fall away and then how it would be restored but in each age even during the falling away time even during the restoration time that that god was bringing his body into a form of him to identify himself in the word because when you read in the book of revelation one of the first things that john observes is that he's walking in the midst of seven lamp stands and so where the purpose then is to bring the bride at the end time the elect you know not just at the end time but all down through the ages was to give the bride in every age rest now this is the same rest the type of this we find is in the old testament where when he brought them out of egypt the promise was i'll take you to a land of rest it's a land flowing with milk and honey it's actually your inheritance that god designed for you before the foundation of the world now there's trespassers there because sin came in you're going to go and you're going to dispossess them because i've given you that land to rest in now we're born just like that was a land this is a land i'm made out of the earth and i was i was intended that this body would live in the presence of god however because of sin there's trespassers living in this body there's the works of sin that are in my flesh and therefore the baptism of the holy ghost which only comes by a revelation of the word in every age that's how the holy ghost came we talk about the token and we talk about a dip of the holy ghost in the ages i get all of that but but bear in mind christ is walking in the seven lamp stands and every age he is revealing a portion of himself and faith in that portion revealed entitled every believer to the holy ghost and gave them rest the same way that israel was to go into rest and they would have rested had they believed the word amen it's evident that that's what they didn't believe at cadence barnea they did not believe the word and therefore they didn't go into the rest and all down through the ages including this one when people don't believe the word that god sends for the age there's no way to enter into rest we have the word of this hour and we want to thank god and rejoice because in this same way this message which came to us by grace it's all by grace and it it's to bring us over the jordan jordan signifies death we're to go through the death and the resurrection in the land of the holy ghost placing us in a position to be ready for a body change and that is what our generation is all about it's about coming to a body change uh brother branham let me have my powerpoint uh brother georgian we'll go to slide 23 as you can see today is chapter one lesson five i only want to read this one quote on our next slide this comes from the end time evangelism net catch it end time evangelism the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the rapture what can it do according to malachi 4 is bring them back to the faith that was once delivered to the saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers the pentecostal part in the restoration time i will restore saith the lord that's real event end time evangelism so so we find that in this that in the last age the bride is not really trying to do necessarily what all the other ages did her evangelism is different she has an end time evangelism and she's not really trying to do what all the other ages did because they were ongoing they were the third age was going to be followed by the fourth followed by the fifth followed by the six but we realize that that in our day we are in the climax of the ages this is the age when there will be a people in this generation that will never taste death and so end time evangelism say well shouldn't we still be holding outreach of course brother branham did shouldn't we go into all the world absolutely we go into all the world the whole the whole rapture is held up until we find that last seed so clearly we still need the power of god revival outreach mission work it must go into all the world because jesus predicated the end upon the fact that that gospel he was preaching which christ was the word christ was the fullness of the word so jesus is saying when the fullness of the word is now in all the earth then the end can come so yes we do evangelize we do missionary work we do preach and teach we do believe in the power of god but what we understand now is that we're not building for another age to come this is the climax age this is the age that leaves and so we're not looking and this is why this is so important because we're not looking for another revival the revival promised to the bride was the fulfillment of malachi 4. and the fulfillment not just god sent a prophet but the message that that prophet brought and the opening of the seals and the bride eating on that book and becoming the final voice to the final age because the second verse references everything that would be seen and so we find that the earth is to have a visual they are to see what god is doing in our age so second corinthians 15 52 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the dead for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we shall be changed so this is the age of the resurrection this is the resurrection age this is the catching away age we're not putting it off into the future we're not waiting for another revival the bride's revival is here now and our task is to daily enter into rest and how do you enter into rest by believing the word and what does that do it dispossesses the enemy and so what is the bride's revival dispossessing this the enemy from out of this flesh and coming into the living image of the living god to be the final voice to the final age and that's the message jesus was saying when the world sees that amen when the world sees the fullness of the word come back again that's the sign of the end time when the world has that the end will come so so we realize that the world is to be in the condition of sodom and gomorrah that's according to luke as it was in the days of lot even so so shall it be when the son of man is revealed so we see that the world is fulfilling its part perfectly amen now if you can see that on the streets you can now i can i can tell you no one got in line to fulfill that it wasn't like hey hey world let's go fulfill luke 17 30. they weren't attempting to fulfill it trying to fulfill it but there were events happening in the supernatural realm that was bringing this world irreversibly to that fulfillment and it didn't matter who they elected or what church or what preacher rose up the world was coming to just what jesus said it would do and if that's the case then the bride also is it doesn't matter how you feel she is coming to that perfection so the bride is getting into the place where she will leave this world and go in to another dimension now we realize that when we talk about the rapture and the bride going into another dimension we're not talking about flying off into the milky way we're talking about just simply stepping into another dimension and it's not going to be a big step i'm thankful to god today to believe that because of the bride's revival being among us that we are now a short step away from the body change amen i'm not looking for anything else to perfect me i already have the other unfolding message it's still unfolding christ is still being made known i'm still dispossessing enemies so that is the bride's revival dispossess the enemies that's what the word came for uh when when when all the world sees the fullness of the word in flesh again the end will come god bless you god bless you let's pray father we thank you for our lesson today we commit it to you now to the hearts and minds of the people in jesus name amen god bless you [Music] testing there we go good morning saints can we just stand and have a word of

lord's house and happy to be his house amen god bless you we're going to um invite you straight away into the word of god this morning and we want to uh take a text from paul's teaching from the second corinthians i want to start there we're going to go from second corinthians to first timothy and from first timothy to second timothy amen praise the lord i want to speak to you this morning on a subject i'm titling the weapons of our warfare being perfected the weapons of our warfare being perfected amen you all love the lord man it's awesome to have a privilege to be in the house of god sure have been enjoying uh the ministry we had a good time ministering the sunday school class i just apologized for that we can't let uh what's one of the classes that we had to say no live audience i'm just sorry for that i know there's a lot of people who enjoy coming to that in the live audience but you have the archive you're able to stream it live um either if you're on the um other half of the alphabet and you're not here today you were able to stream it i'm sure and if you were on your way to church you could probably catch it a lot of times when i can't catch the video driving because the signal's all over the place sometimes the audio will work so that's just a little a little note there sometimes you can catch the audio all right second corinthians 10 i'm not gonna read second corinthians and daniel am i amen amen second corinthians 10 and i want to read two ver three verses here verse um three four and five for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh all right i want to read that again for though we walk in the flesh amen we do we do no need to deny that we do we walk in the flesh now we'd rather not be in this flesh but we are okay so here's the advice we do not war after the flesh so my all of my energies ought not to be worrying over this flesh and fussing over it and trying to trying to you know prop it up i i got another flesh coming and that's the one i'm trying to get to all right verse four for the weapons of the world's warfare no i read that wrong for the weapons of the antichrist are not for the weapons of who our warfare are not carnal but mighty see they're not carnal but they are mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity did you know you were to go capture something bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ do you know why you have to capture it because it won't come into the obedience of christ naturally because it lives in a fallen body with a fallen mind you understand the womb of our soul the nature of our spirit has been changed that's god that's zoe but my memory conscience reason affections imaginations all fallen see that's why my sight can he can so tempt me through my sight or through my taste or my touch you understand so all right now first timothy let's move several books forward to first timothy chapter one i love the word of god amen so first timothy chapter one if you hit hebrews you went too far back up first timothy chapter one and i want to catch two verses uh looks like i have 18 and 19 at least i'm supposed to have i think 18-19 first timothy 1 18. this charge i commit unto the son timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them midas war a good warfare holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck move on one book over to second timothy chapter two we'll catch verses one through 4 yep verses 1 through 4 thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and the things thou hast had thou hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that wareth see we're in a war no man at war entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier so when your commanding officer sends you into battle don't get sidetracked by the cares of life so that you may please your commanding officer that easy not easy simple not straightforward wow that's not complex we can all go man i get that you know why because it makes sense all right let's pray father we want to come and commit ourselves into your hands for service just now i don't know how far along i'll get in my notes today i've i've really lord just what word would i use i've really had to go slow i've really had to be careful that i'm because i could i could feel that you had a very very specific message for today and so i've i realized that my normal pace wasn't getting it i kept running over and you'd call me back and look at it again and i'd run over it and you'd call me back and slow down you said i want this to go i want this very meticulously dealt with so lord what can i do i'm just a man so i'm just here today have mercy on me lord have mercy on us all because we want to learn the tactics of the spiritual warfare that we're in and we need your help lord that's just the straight truth and everybody in here would admit it lord we need your help the world is just in a chaotic state and my we don't even hardly know how to make sense of it all but father i i know this much i don't want to have my mind on the things of the world i'm here to fight a fight a spiritual war i'm here on a mission lord i'm not from here this isn't my this world is not my home i'm just passing through my treasures are laid up in another realm lord so help us now lord i'm sure you will teach us your ways lord we commit ourselves into your hands lord it's all we can do i'm just here as your servant just your assistant i committed to you in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated amen praise the lord so the weapons of our warfare we can talk about weapons of our warfare and we would we would bring up you know faith this might say and say what's a great weapon faith you know trust that's a weapon prayer that's a weapon people don't leverage it often but it is a great weapon in fact his brother branham called it the greatest weapon he makes reference to love being the greatest power so i think i'd like to have the greatest power the world you know hollywood has gone crazy with all of this superhero stuff and every kid's got his favorite superhero he wants to be there are superheroes in the world and it's god's family there are people who are eternal beings living here living among us we're it i love this quote was posted by one of the ministers in minister's chat early this morning it's a quote from spurgeon says i just love this never heard it before as many as much as i've read of charles spurgeon spurgeon says when asked what is more important praying or reading my bible now reading your bible is a weapon they asked brother branham how do we get closer to god now would you imagine that's an important question how do i get closer to god is that important come on is that important do you want to be closer do you feel like you need to be so i'm i'm i'm i'm feel pretty close to him good i'm glad but it's nuts out there come on hey how about we just stay in simple common sense preaching today not going to take you into ethereal heights today let's just let's just keep it simple and let's just all agree wow the world in its condition i really need to be close to god reading my bible and praying is what brother branham said so the question is a fair one when a prophet of this age is answering the question how do i get closer to god read your bible and pray spurgeon says when asked what is more important praying or reading the bible i ask what is more important breathing in or breathing out you tell me you tell me tell me which one you could do less of breathing in or breathing out read your bible and pray which one's more important which one's more important breathing into breathing out i thought that was a remarkable statement love is the greatest power prayer is the greatest weapon reading our bible is a necessary element faith capturing thoughts contrary to the word there's a big one don't entangle yourself with the affairs of the world that's a big one think about all the things that paul could have advised timothy on and he picked that one he said listen timothy you're in a war i'm getting ready to depart the time of my departure is at hand you're going to you're going to be here after i'm gone now i'd like to be with you timothy for your whole life but that's not going to happen god doesn't have it planned that way so when i'm gone grievous wolves are going to come in among you and i'm going to tell you how to handle this whatever you do recognize you're in a war and when you're in a war recognize that you don't want to be entangled with the affairs of life now hey we got we got to have jobs we get educations we run businesses we raise families we do live here so the bible you know when paul talks about them you know you know going you know leaving the world coming out of the world and they write paul back you know how do we do what does that look like what do you mean i mean do we do we build a convent and we just cloister ourselves and paul writes back in his second letter and he references that now when i said to you about leaving the world of course i didn't mean you go out of the world you live here but you don't live here as abusing it you don't you live here knowing you're not from here amen this is a common sense way that you're going to keep victory in your life and i don't know about you but i want all the victory i can get yes say how much is enough more than i got when will you be satisfied when i don't need to fight anymore when i can lay my burdens down when i can lay my burdens down and like thomas like like like like stonewall jackson said when he he was he was passing away and the last words that came out of his mouth and they they the the the guy who wrote his life story who was there said you know as if he was inviting all of us to go with him he said come friends let us cross the river and set under the shade of a tree oh he knew where he was going he knew his redeemer lived i'm going to tell you something friends when i don't have to fight anymore i i want victories until while i'm fighting i want to win i don't like not winning without love there's no need to prophesy there's no need to give your body to be burned there's no need to be a martyr if you don't have love there's no need to preach great mysteries of god if love is not the primary life force in your life now we're not talking about human filio love that's that's just really intense friendship that that a lot of times is the levels of that are predicated by you know what have you done for me lately that's the attitude of the world that's why husbands and wives better get married on more than just filial love because when bad times roll in the love wanes and naturally so you're not going to like somebody that's not being nice to you you understand so there's got to be an agape love there's got to be and there's only one form of that and that's god remember as i've told you bible doesn't declare god has love the bible declares he is that actually he is love so if there's no real love of god which only comes by the baptism of the holy ghost that's what the bible teaches the love of god is poured into you by the holy ghost amen so this kind of love only comes by being born again that's why you can't fake it the devil see right through it see but he but he does recognize that light when he sees it glowing in you amen he's very much afraid of that light so you know brother branham talks about things like prayer and he says you know prayer keeps you from being sticky i love that old southern term like you know you're like a a a burr you ever get around well let me let me not go there i don't want to i don't want to be a bird under your saddle amen i don't want to be sticky i don't want to be sticky to my friends to the family of god i don't want to be sticky to the neighbors i don't want to be sticky to i don't want to be sticky here's a here's a statement going to blow your mind i wouldn't want to come across sticky to antifa amen i'd want to stand in the face of all of their rage and tell them about the love of god and say they'd spit in your face they spit in his face see antifa is not new antifa started in heaven where demons got got got together and that battle spilled over into the earth and those demon spirits got in people that's what brother branham taught us all right antifa is a modern word but it's it's the same old same old devil so we get so sticky when we're away from his presence now that's a big one there's a weapon coming into his presence you know why you're here today to sharpen your weapon sometimes your weapon needs some maintenance that's why you come together we come we gather together in a building to get our weapons maintenanced so we get sticky when we're away from the presence of love because the reality is that we live in a sinful flesh with a sinful mind amen i'm trying to move this up because i'm keep getting wind noise in it so i think you can hear me all right with it at that level okay good so the 10 senses as we said just as we were getting started the 10 senses uh that we're born in they they remain perverted i'm sorry i'm not trying to insult you to say you have a perverted mind i'm i'm not trying to insult you that your imagination is perverted your memories your conscience your reasonings they are subject to perverse thoughts perverse notions perverse ideas you'll never get faith in your heart to be perverted because that's only god brother brandon said in the heart there's only one or two it's either faith or doubt it's either the the fallen condition you're born in in that case it's dark it's of the devil or it's born again and it's god and in there there is no doubt but in my mind i can reason the word of god away and end up with a reasoned out word of god that's not anything like the word of god the devil can can work through my eyes if i'm not careful and make and and my eyes gaze at something and then the devil come and anoint my imagination amen you understand and brother branham talks about that and he says the natural progression of that he says you and he says you thinking you're just thinking this is all it is you haven't done anything he said you you men you see some half-dressed woman out on the street and you get thinking maybe i could make a date with her see you get thinking he said it'll cost you your soul boy amen she's she's uh she's she's there she doesn't realize it maybe she'll get saved somewhere down the road but until she done until she does she's a weapon in the hands of satan come on we're going to be real today oh it's going to get more real amen you good all right here's a second thing that i have from spurgeon today i thought it was ironic i'd find that one this morning i pulled this out of some of his memoirs says virgin says speaking of the bride of christ he says when she has not been ashamed to put the cross in the forefront and she has never had to be ashamed of that the bride of christ listen friends i know the world might sneer at you but you got nothing to be ashamed of putting the cross of christ in front of somebody you ought not to be backwards or embarrassed over that see the crucified you say oh well but the crucified christ might might get me rejected might get you laughed at it might also because the crucified christ also has irresistible do attraction understand that if god is trying to pull somebody out of the world the best thing you can present them with is a crucified christ because that that has such a such a a pull on a man's heart who already feels guilty about his sin because he knows he's wrong and then you begin to tell him about how that god loves him anyway and that god came down and took on the form of sinful man and died on a cross so he would never have to and took every sin he's ever committed and pitched him off in the sea of forgetfulness i'm here to tell you that's an attractive message don't ever think it's not just because you see someone brother branham you might see a prostitute on the street corner brother branham said how do you know which all she might need is an invitation to church a handshake to say god bless you young lady let me invite you to church i can tell you about somebody who can change your life take you off of the street corner make a real lady out of you she might not want that but she might see so spurgeon says the crucified christ has irresistible attraction i love this term never heard it the city of man's soul the city of man's soul is captured before the siege begins when the prince emanuel uncovers the beauties of his dying love before the eyes of the rebellious ones catch it again the city of man a man's soul the city of man soul is captured before the siege begins when the prince emanuel uncovers the beauties of his dying love before the eyes of the rebellious ones christ is drawing all peoples to himself by the power of love brother brahm said it was the greatest power on earth the only crime spurgeon concludes the only crime that could ever be laid to jesus's charge was that of loving beyond all reason and beyond all bounds so he says to us today let me let me let you hear his words from hundreds of years ago hear the words of this great servant always keep a dying christ to the forefront the cross without christ is no cross at all amen so love you know friends love is the key to eternal life love is the key to eternal life it's it's love is how a church stays unified i mean you know it's think about the possibilities of the devil when a a corporal body of people come in a corporate environment and all come together and we all got it we're all different we all got different backgrounds from different places different you know raising different preaching that we heard in years past and now yet we've got the the uh the amazing task to come together and we're we're compelled that come together first come together and be in one mind and be in one accord fallen humans from every diverse aspect of life i mean the the whole smorgasbord the merry-go-round of life and we all going to come together really and all of us are going to are going to lay aside all of our idiosyncrasies and we're going to be in one mind and one accord so that god can have so that god can be preeminent i'm here to tell you you can never do that the only one that can do that is love when the love of god is shed abroad jesus said if i be lifted up i'll draw oh men to me i don't need to draw men to me i need to draw men to him and the best way for me to do that is to let him live inside me but a lot of good it does him to give you the new birth if you put him and make him sit in a corner thank you for my new birth now please sit still and don't interfere with my life did you know he'll do that brother brad that's that's a quote brother branham said he he he wants all of you but he'll take whatever you give him he says as much as you will get out of put the world out and make room for him he'll fill that spot he won't force he won't kick any of your doors in but as much as you will make room for him he'll occupy it see he loves his family but his desire has never been okay you're born again see on the other side his whole purpose was so that you could be a conduit between heaven and earth see so a lot of times you know when we the bible says you know bring every thought subject because you're going to have a bunch of them and you've got to bring them subject to the word of god because the devil is always going to be trying to fill our mind with thoughts that are contrary to his word and we have to stay unified you know we as as a church here here's a here's something i'm sure everybody will own this this is just a fact we can we can become critical of others who don't walk like we walk who don't observe their christianity exactly like i do and buddy let me tell you i happen to know that my way's the perfect way and y'all just need to be like me but come on isn't that easy don't we have to guard against that come on humans come on don't we have to guard against that and sometimes we don't guard against it and then you know what happens criticism starts i'm glad that we've been largely free of that 25 years i i appreciate in in some cases brother branham said the church will take the spirit of its pastor people think that's always a bad thing it's not always a bad thing if if the pastor is a gentle loving kind affectionate man then the church will take that spirit and i'm glad i'm glad that you love one another and that you love me and we're all in this together and we're like one big family i love it thank you thank you thank you those are watching today who weren't allowed to be here god blessed you for that i'm so proud of that it makes me feel like because i i feel like i've hardly done nothing for the lord but at least i can point the devil and say devil look at them they love one another they love me and even even when we get away from our prayer time get away from our gathering come on come on sometimes we let the the affairs of the world we're not supposed to get tangled up but we do and we get a little sticky and we get a little critical we still love one another we're just being sticky and you're not supposed to do that but you have to take steps to not do that it's not a magic wand or pixie dust you have to take steps to to let the love of god reign supreme we get critical of others who don't walk like we walk who don't praise how we think they should praise you know people we've had over the years every kind and i'm glad that the ones that were ordained to be here will be here amen and the ones that ordained to be somewhere else are somewhere else because my ministry can't feed the world i'm glad that god gave me some people to preach to amen praise god but you know there's people who who don't even attend this church any longer who who who have got angry and stormed out of the building angry because a song was sung they didn't like a song because it wasn't the way they were raised it wouldn't be a song they don't think that song should be chosen do you you want me to tell you a little secret y'all might not know because you're not a pastor did you know that in my experience every pastor i've ever met without the exception of one has had that kind of problem in his church amen some of the some of the schisms that get started in churches i can tell you 60 to 70 of the time conservatively is over the disagreement about a song does that shock you i'm telling you it's the truth in my experience and the experience of other pastors i talk to i've talked to pastors who you know i could name them they're very well known around the world have churches much larger than this one have have told me and said you know i had a situation where i i needed to make a change but i had to be careful because this person is strategic and and and yeah i need to do it but if i do it the wrong way i'm going to injure 9 or 10 or 11 other people so i got to be really prayerful on how i go about it you'd think man pastor just do it and this was a senior pastor to me saying no you don't you don't just do it you're dealing with people you got to be careful you got to consider yourself see oh y'all didn't know that kind of stuff goes on in churches did you [Laughter] probably because we're so perfect we don't deal with that we ain't we something oh they they didn't want to hear a song that was sung you know we're we're different come on aren't we we got i was in the in the musicians meeting the other day we were talking about this very thing and i said and i started comparing i said look at our look at we got four worship leaders and they're all as different as knight is from day they don't they're not anything alike i said you know some of them are are yankees i said you know brother kenny we pretty much made him into a southern southern gentleman brother brad was a super yankee and so it's took we've had to work on him and he's he's turned into a complete southern cream puff he's got that southern charm to him amen sister rebecca sent me a check for that one amen no she didn't really brother matt brother anthony completely different in their styles one from another and you're all different one from another we're all different but we all love the lord see you know a lot of times crowd mentality crowd mentality let me call it that where everybody just okay what's the crowd let me just take the crowd mentality you know crowd mentality is where driven cattle find comfort driven cattle find comfort and crowd mentality what's everybody doing okay let me just do that you know but but you know if you start messing with our you know we we get this idea hey let's everybody just be alike okay because if you start messing with our with our mold then then we start getting uncomfortable we get end up being around people who are different than us i'm going to keep preaching y'all might as well just stay right with me i'm going to keep this smile on my face the whole time because you know why my face is smiling because my heart is i mean that very sincerely i mean that i said to the lord if you want me to preach something like this you're going to put a smile in my heart so a lot of times when we start messing with our church mold people get their mold messed with you know everybody just needs to get in my mold you know some people are northern some people are southern some people are western we talked about brother dale leading singing here and brother dale was as redneck western jarhead as you can get doesn't sing very good but one of my favorite song leaders in the world because you just get bowled over by brother dale's sincerity he loves god he just starts singing and sometimes he's off key and out of tune and has to joanne or deb has to help him and but oh he loves worshiping god it ain't like i worship god i wish i could worship god like that amen so we sometimes we get out of our mold you know they they don't they don't come right out and say it a lot of times but but the feeling that often gets projected is you know why must you be different why can't you just be like i am well you don't know the cost of the oil in my alabaster box you don't know you weren't there when he when jesus found me you weren't there when when the lord wrapped his loving arms around me you don't know the cost of the oil in my alabaster box let me be who i am let me love him for how i love him let me worship him in spirit and in truth according to the feeling of my heart people get so judgmental people get so critical i say you weren't there you don't know you don't know you say i don't think you should you should sing like that well you don't know you weren't there when jesus found me you don't know what i came from maybe you were raised in a cloistered environment i wasn't see not speaking of me i'm speaking the third person and and people get so judgmental because people aren't like they are and i just say god has a bouquet of people and he saves them from the uttermost to the gutter most and he brings them from near and far hallelujah jesus has a table spread where the saints of god are fed he invites all of his chosen people come and dine don't judge me by your experience you weren't there the night jesus found me as the cece winans sings you you did not feel what i felt when he wrapped his loving arms around me you know what that woman wanted when she brought that alabaster box and brother branham said she went into that store and took all of her earnings and she said he'll know where i got this money he'll know what kind of woman i am he'll know this is dirty money but i don't care and she walked in and piles it down i want the best that you have and brother branham said give him your best he he don't make him second said jesus don't want to be second and he don't deserve to be second give him your best don't put him down the list of priorities in your life he needs to be the top priority he needs to be the center the hub of every spoke of your life [Music] if you want a a smooth perfectly round wheel don't dent the spokes that thing a wobble jesus wants to be the center hub with perfect spokes reaching out to every facet of your life so that you roll smoothly through life what we need a lot of times friends what we need if we're honest if we're honest how many want to be honest what we need sometimes is a fresh dose of the love of god in our hearts we're not to get entangled as paul said wow if there was ever a time that has an enticement to get entangled it's now with this political environment we're looking at it it's hard to resist come on let's on it you get involved it gets your dandruff you want to say something i think wow why do i care i'm not of this world i don't care who they elect it's not what difference does it make who's going to who's going to win the election the one god decided before he ever formed the world he knows who's going to win in november it and why do i care say well if you want this if you want that i want this i'm not trying to figure my life out what folly is that i i you say why not don't you want to be in control of your life no why because i drove it into a ditch too many times i ran it off a cliff i got tired of crashing into the valley floor i just said lord i don't want you to be my co-pilot i want you to be my pilot we get all hyped up and all worried and all dandered up and all vexed my goodness and and when you get like that brother branham said as soon as that wolf nature starts coming the dove just he's very timid he just he just goes and flies and sits on a limb and waits it won't come near you and you wonder where's my joy where's my moisture where's my feeling well he's out there on a limb because you got that old you say you mean i went and got a wolf nature no you woke up with one you went to bed last night with one he lives inside you he's in your members you can't get rid of him god's gonna get rid of him when he changes this whole body hallelujah sometimes we need a fresh dose of the love of god in our heart brother donnie was speaking here recently i so appreciated it you know brother donnie talks about you know the the the the saints of god are are are sickened from this uh uh affliction and you know that's that's going around in the world this is serious this pandemic it ain't no joke fathers have died saints of god mothers pastors preachers you understand around the world we've got on our on our minister's list constantly brother daryl ward and his family right now sick with covet all of them this is serious friends our brothers and sisters are suffering they're suffering and and people people and brother donnie goes on to say and people write in the message out here arguing and fuming over the politics of it all come on do you understand people are dying understand god's family is sick we need to be in prayer we're not supposed to entangle ourselves with the affairs of the world we're all brother donnie goes on i'm glad i'm i'm just telling you what he said but i i approve this message people argue and fume over the politics of it all breaking down all the arguments back and forth back and forth argument this argument that the conservative the liberal did you hear this did you hear that do you hear what they're doing did you hear i wish this and i wish that oh my goodness others and and and breaking down all the arguments and others others are arguing about wearing a mask how their rights are being violated people are dying sons of god pastors mamas daddies children do you understand the world is being destroyed the tribulation is setting in i i'm not here to argue over my rights i'm here to give up my rights i'm here to say lord by whatever means i can be a light to this world come on friends the world order is ending mankind is suffering so what so what that the devil has twisted it all up and made a political cancel culture out of it all why do i care about that the lord is coming news flash the rapture's on i'm not here to give you a news flash guess what happened in the white house guess what happened in the house of representatives guess what happened the supreme court guess what happened why do i care the rapture's on god is coming the bride is leaving oh my i'm tell you what we have a need we don't need to be worrying about our civil rights for crying out loud when people are dying we need to be busy about the father's business satan has been able to literally set people on the sideline from being able to do the father's business because they're arguing over the political nonsense going on in the world and this rights and this violation and buddy they're not going to tell me and who's oh for crying out loud let me take you to the hospital bed and and and a wife and children are out and weeping and crying because he's he's probably dying let me sit you let me set you in the in the in the emails that i get people pleading please pray brother uh i don't want to die and god help me and some of god's family god is electing to let him cross over with coven 19. not here to tell god his business god is here to tell you your business god is here to give you your business what are you doing what are you doing involved and all dandered up over something like that we don't even live here what rights do i have i only want these anyhow i'm not from here i don't care about that kind of stuff say brother jason have you found yourself sure yeah i'm a human just like you i've stood in the mirror and said shame on you you know what i you know what else i you know what else i've done that i hope you'll do also i've looked in the mirror and said shame on you and then i looked back in the mirror and said thank you for saying that yeah amen amen and the next image in the mirror was me on my knees the love of god has been shed abroad so much has happened when listen friends let me just ask you some gentle questions these are the questions the lord asked me when does love silence our human reasoning when does it silence our out-of-control human emotions when does love finally put that down amen i don't you say well what's the answer well i know what i'm praying i'm saying lord every hour of every day let love put my emotions to silence let love put my human reasoning to silence when does love live in us and set aside our rights when are you willing to say not my will i'm not here for my rights i'm here the son of man came not to be served but to serve the son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister all those kinds of human right demands and our incredulous reactions do you know where that comes from your other nature yeah amen i read you a quote just a couple maybe several services ago i don't have it in front of me but brother branham talks about when you go off into those kind of tangents and things like that and he said you're living in your other nature he said you're letting the flesh control your mind your reasonings your actions and your reactions and it's almost always our reactions more than our actions that get us in trouble it's the easiest one to step out and displease the holy ghost and send the dove spirit to a limb to wait on you to calm down it's from the fallen side of you you know i see i won't change gears i've about locked you up with that one let me let me change gears might get worse my heart's still smiling i see but jason what do you see in all this global pandemic i see a divine work of god in this global pandemic say wow brother jason i know you're always the half glass half full guy i know you always try to find a silver lining around the darkest cloud and you're right and i do and i think that's a better way to live i'd rather believe the best and if i get wrong well get found out wrong that i'm just wrong but i'd rather believe the best i'd rather hope that it'll get better amen and and i i would rather i would rather let the weak say i'm strong amen so i see a silver lining i know the covenant 19 is the work of the devil i get that i get that god don't put sickness on his people it's a work of the devil but i see god remember the bible says that all things work together for our good god will even take bad things and make them work together if you'll just be patient and trust him and to me say what possible silver lining can you see and the global pandemic of covet 19 well once again i see it that god has shown to us shown his love to us in that you know one of the things he's taught us and i was just like a little kid in a candy shop to realize this that our spirituality isn't bound to church schedule alone you can't even come but to have the services if you wanted to you understand i i'm i'm i've it's been such a release for me to to not just let my emotions you know fall into grand canyon because so and so didn't where was so and so why why weren't they in church oh my goodness for years i've those kind of things bother you because you put in so much work and you you you know you you want to see a dividend come back and and and when you don't you get all twisted up but you know what i've seen i found out that that when this global pandemic hindered our gathering you know what we found out uh we we and we so needed to find out was that when we were hindered from from coming here you know what we did we just increased his presence in our homes we we increased we increased it in our homes we increased it in our daily lives and we found out that coming in these four walls isn't the end-all it's a tool it's a weapon but i got a whole arsenal of weapons and maybe i needed to find out that that that i can't depend on coming to this building two times a week maybe i need to increase make my home a church make my life a church because it might get worse before it gets better and it may never get better even cut off from one another we found new ways to grow spiritually right in the midst of something that satan intended for our harm i'm gonna tell you something friends today if you have found a way to increase your spirituality with coming to church less and you've found a way to increase your spirituality you get to laugh in the devil's face and you are to make it a belly laugh a big one that he can hear running away you know he say is there a precedent for that you know sure sure sure there is that when daniel and his companions stepped out in faith and they stopped eating the healthy nice good nutritious food from the king's table and they ate this little bit of almost nothing food and the steward who was over them he wanted to let him do it and he said but you're going to get me killed if you show up to the king after this after this many days and and you're pale because you haven't been eating i'm going to have my head took off because i'm supposed to take care of you and daniel said don't worry said let me and my brothers stop eating the dainties of his table and eat our own simple food that god provides and then you examine us in seven days or ten days or however many days it was and when he came back to examine them their cheeks were more rosy they were their their flesh was more supple it was they were they had increased so let me tell you something friends that that that that you know it god has ways to supply his family god knew we would end in a pandemic god knew that we wouldn't all be able to meet like we always have but god has made a way there's my silver lining what silver lining i have found other ways to be more spiritual because i realize now i couldn't rely on coming to a four wall building as much as i used to see i wasn't going to be able to get all your licks of fire gathered around me at once we can't do it but that silver lining hasn't applied to everybody it hasn't been the story for some of god's family i hope you heard how i said that god's family i'm still giving you credit for being in god's family i'm just saying you might have missed the silver lining and so the the pandemic that satan brought boy he's wiped you out with it when it need not have been god provided a way that you could turn it around on him and make it a weapon of victory but you didn't do it you played into the way of the pandemic satan hoped it would work on you the coronavirus has certainly taken its physical toll we've talked about that but and even some in god's family we've talked about that but many more who never caught the physical sickness have been devastated by the spiritual impact devastated for the most of us it's been a great learning experience a great growing experience in god but for some it's been just the opposite and that's sad that's sad satan i'm sad to say today that satan has been fabulously successful in damaging some of your spiritual walk sapping you of your spiritual strength he's managed to fill you with more carnality than you already had before the pandemic and all that's happened now because you don't even you don't even use the weapon of coming to church half the time amen see and we even we even have social distancing and we wear masks and we have hand sanitizers and this is one of the safest places you could be in and he's been fabulously he's he's managed to fill up your life with more carnality he's kept you from the house of god more successfully than than at any time in your christian experience why have you let him do that amen see say you're preaching to us we're sitting here well i'm not just preaching to you i'm preaching to an audience there and i'm preaching on an archive that goes around the world he's kept you from the house of god more successfully in extreme love in a and a i'm going to have a fit of extreme love here because it's difficult to say these kinds of things but i i work for somebody and i don't get a choice so let me say it as gently don't get up and go get a lemonade please don't cut me off don't and you can still sit there and cut me off don't cut me off in your mind i'm trying to help you so let me just say gently and kindly with love you've decided that you won't go to church fear anxiety carnality i i'm angry over my civil rights being violated we got it all other people just like i just don't like going to church so i'm just going to use this for an excuse to not i'd rather go do something else and you don't avail yourself of this great weapon that god has given us even with a 50 schedule you still go to work say oh i can't come to church it's not safe you still go to work you're still around all kinds of people that's right see you're still around all kinds of people you still go to the grocery stores honey sweetie pies darlings of my ministry you go to grocery stores you go to drug stores you go to department stores i don't even like going to department stores when there was no pandemic oh here's going to be a big one because 75 of the men in the church know i'm talking to them you still go to contractor supply stores you still work inside customers homes you stop on the street and talk to people but you won't come to church you forfeit a major weapon okay oh my little honey pies my darlings in the gospel let me give you a very sincere benefit of the doubt and acknowledge i'm gonna let's take the fear side for a minute let's acknowledge maybe you have a very real fear maybe has nothing to do with carnality maybe i'm completely off base on that maybe you're listening to this sermon right now and saying but jason it's not that you got me wrong well you know i i really have a a fear and and and and and i don't now if you say it's a real fear okay i don't i don't then i don't understand why you can do all those other things but let me give you some grace and acknowledge that you may have an authentic fear that i just can't understand here's what i can say to help you because i'm only trying to help you how many believe that this is a very relevant sermon friends we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow i do know what i i can predict the fit the future if you give me a six-month window i can tell you with 100 certainty say okay what's it going to be worse than it is worse than it is if you give me 12-month window i can give you 100 certainty it's going to be much worse than it is here's what i can say to help you if you do have a genuine fear though i can't understand that because you still go to those other places but here's what i can say satan gave you that fear that's a hundred percent sure satan gave you that fear he's filled you with fear amen hold on hold on hold on you allowed it he gave it to you and you allowed it a spirit of fear did not come from god we're not given the spirit of fear we're given the spirit of a sound mind it came from satan who showed up with the delivery and you signed for it amen i'll tell you your future by the word i'm not a prophet now hear me this line's heavy but i'm going to tell you your future if you don't soon return to cinder on that package you're going to find that what you signed for you agreed to a lifetime payment plan and when you're gone and not and not here anymore your children will still be paying those payments your children's children will continue making those payments i'm here to tell you you'll never pay it off the interest alone will bury you bury your children bury your children's children if the lord should tarry oh friends throw it off today we're not giving the spirit of fear we're giving a sound mind we're given the mind of christ it's going to get much worse if you're if you can't run with the footman how you going to handle the horse [Music] where is the thankfulness that's what i'd like to ask some people who just don't even come back to church anymore where is the thankfulness to the lord for his blessings on you i still got a few minutes where just ask yourself now think friends because i'm not browbeating you i'm asking you to think this is just brother jason saying think about it okay where is the thankfulness to the lord for his blessings on you amen i see you living in nice homes i see you growing your business making money raising kids happy and blessed of god i see him pouring showers of blessing on you drenching you in success amen where is coming to the house of god just to return thanks for that just as a testimony among the saints too many i'm afraid are not allowing the lord to be more in their lives like kovid taught us we could do coven 19 taught us he could be more in our homes sadly in some cases he's not covered 19 taught us he could be more in our lives and needed to be and in some cases that's not the case he can be more in your homes more in your families and and we've realized it and we needed to we needed to realize it and i but my fear is that you haven't realized that because i don't see you even willing to come to the house of god and let your light shine amen say brother jason they might close the doors to that church down and we could never come back there again well then those who have made their homes a sanctuary in their lives of sanctuary will be okay you'll get worse and worse and worse because you haven't learned to do it during the footman how are you going to do it during the horseman see gather you know not willing to gather with the body of christ which he told us through paul that we needed to do amen we needed to do more as we see the day approaching i i i don't even see you gathering it for no other reason than just for thankfulness for his blessings wow that's tough ain't it you say you don't you don't know pastor you're judging me you're judging me you could be right maybe i could be or maybe maybe it's that you just need to stop lying to yourself amen telling yourself that you're okay maybe you're not okay maybe i'm right oh yes see sold out christians come together sold out christians sing songs of worship together sold out christians praise god together hear the word together say amen together pull on the preaching together adam where art thou adam it should have been the opposite it should have been adam hearing him come and running lord help me but instead he ran the other way and he's hiding in god in his love god in his love adam today has chased you into your living room saying where are you son where's your home where's your family what about your kids oh my you might need to stop drop and roll oh yes amen might need to run as fast as you can to an altar don't pass go one more time around the board don't collect another 200 of god's blessings go directly to an altar and pray and stay there until you fill back up with the fire you once knew hallelujah amen we i'm i'm closing i'm not going to get finished i can already see i'm just going to stop we are going to need these weapons finely tuned love faith prayer gathering all they'll let us while they'll let us we need to do it we need to be building our homes into sanctuaries building our lives into sanctuaries because they've already limited us to half and it might get worse we have had times where it was zero and only a preacher and a broadcast crew what if we go back to that where's your homes where's your heart where's your mind what's your life what's your activities come on i see the blessing of god reigning on you where's the gratitude back to god for that we're going to need the power of love and the weapon of prayer this world is in a chaotic time but sometimes friends the greater truth is that we're the one in the spiritual chaos of our innermost being so you ask yourself you you see you've let me just type the natural to the spiritual you got another three minutes five minutes you see it like i see it we see the chaos on the streets the madness the rioting the looting i get that they've hijacked peaceful demonstrations i get that some people were there for peaceful demonstrations that's their american right soldiers bled i've stood in i've stood in the graveyard in the philippines and seen white rose you talking you think if you've ever been to washington dc and i have and ever been to arlington and i have it almost i know it sounds crazy it almost can't compare to the one that they've got in the philippine islands that one is just rolling hills and rolling hills and as far as the eye can see of white crosses and star of david where men bled out there and we're buried there never got never even come back home some of their remains just some of them are just a a marker so many men and and service people and women included even back in world war ii and nurse corps and and things like that gave their lives so that people could peacefully demonstrate and address their grievances to the government i like what a federal judge says he said you ought to be standing on the steps shouting your grievances not shouting at the building and trying to burn it down that's not what the fathers had in mind to redress grievances we see the chaos in the world right now we see a portrait of fallen flesh and fallen mind and we see as i said this this spiritual warfare these demons that are working in those people who are just sheer anarchists don't even have a cause they're just full of the devil and have hijacked noble call noble uh uh demonstrations and have hijacked it and the devil has so captured and i'm not here to argue the politics of it i already told you i don't care about it anymore but what what but what i do see is something that informs my thinking about my own fallen flesh if it's not brought under the love of god now that's the point i'm making we see the characteristics of these following fallen elements they know no restraint they resist all authority rebellious to all instruction say yeah we need to put them in prison well let me tell you something this whole idea of knowing no restraint and resisting all authority and rebellions to all instruction and injuries to all things that are good this is the wretched man that paul said i am amen amen i'm that way you're that way we're no different than them you'd be right out there with them but why aren't you the love of god has constrained you but don't be fooled and think you're not still in a fallen condition don't go thinking you don't need to pray and read your bible and come to church don't go thinking that you don't need to hear the preaching because paul said i'm still a wretched man in my members there's no good thing amen when he he did what a lot of us need to do he took a full dose of honest introspection in the presence of god that's a fancy word we used to call it soul-searching back in the time of our innocence and we were fresh minted christians hallelujah we're going to need the weapons of our warfare friends you're going to need them love you have to work on it faith you have to exercise it amen you come to church you read your bible you hear the tapes you hear preaching you pray these are elements you bring your family where's your family where where's your family in relation to an altar where's your family in relation to the spirituality that god has exposed that we could have and satan brings in covet 19 locks the world down and god goes guess what here's a growing opportunity what lord the whole world's in a chaos yeah but you don't have to be you you can grow in this you can give the devil a black eye hurry go ahead what do i do lord work on your love exercise your faith come to church read your bible hear the preaching pray pray pray grow don't diminish grow i've not been in an oven cooking i'm not done i have been in oven cooking i'm done i'm finished and done brother matt used to have a second grade teacher and he would say she'd say did you did you finish your work and he'd say i'm done she'd say oh you've been in an oven cooking he'd say i mean i'm finished so i'm i'm finished and i'm probably finished and i'm done amen the lord loves you friends loves me loves you loves all of us one and all the love of god that's shed abroad in all of our hearts [Music] amen praise the lord what you want
