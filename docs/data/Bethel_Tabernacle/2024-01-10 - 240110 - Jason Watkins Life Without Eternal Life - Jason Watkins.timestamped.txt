[36:32] poor do not the rich men oppress you and
[36:35] draw you before the Judgment seats do
[36:38] not they blaspheme that worthy Name by
[36:41] which ye called if ye fulfill the Royal
[36:46] law according to the scripture Thou
[36:49] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you
[36:52] do well but if you have respect to
[36:56] person you commit sin and are convinced
[36:59] of the law as
[37:01] transgressors for whosoever shall keep
[37:03] the whole law and yet offend in one
[37:07] point he is guilty of all for he that
[37:11] said do not commit adultery said also do
[37:14] not kill now if thou commit no adultery
[37:17] yet if thou kill th Thou Art become a
[37:19] transgressor of the law so speak ye and
[37:24] so do as they that shall be judged by
[37:27] the law of Liberty now that's a
[37:30] wonderful word isn't it the law of
[37:32] Liberty so we got a royal law and we got
[37:35] the law of
[37:36] Liberty for he shall have judgment
[37:39] without Mercy that hath showed no mercy
[37:43] and I love this and mercy rejoiceth
[37:46] against
[37:48] [Music]
[37:49] judgment let's
[37:52] pray Master we thank you now for your
[37:55] word that we we've read and Lord I just
[37:59] covet your your complete takeover Lord
[38:03] of this service tonight and I pray that
[38:06] you will help us to look into the word
[38:09] father to see what our needs are and to
[38:12] see how our needs are met in you I
[38:15] commit myself into your hands for
[38:17] service just now in Jesus name amen God
[38:21] bless you friends you can be
[38:25] seated
[38:39] so a royal law a law of
[38:43] Liberty I want to just make a few
[38:45] comments about this before we go too far
[38:48] into
[38:50] it so it's a royal
[38:52] law and as I as I began to look at that
[38:57] and began to break it down I wondered
[39:00] you know why James would call it Royal
[39:05] why that that would be the adjective
[39:07] that he would choose to use in the Greek
[39:11] and I'm not going to do a breakdown of
[39:12] the Greek tonight but he used this very
[39:16] you know this very descriptive word to
[39:19] describe the
[39:21] characteristics of the law from the
[39:24] lawgiver and he calls it and and
[39:27] thinking of a way to describe the law of
[39:30] Liberty which is in Christ only in
[39:33] Christ then he would call it a royal law
[39:37] and so we realize then that because it's
[39:41] a a royal law the
[39:44] law uh you know would would describe a
[39:48] manifestation um can I say it this way
[39:52] of a royal
[39:53] person and and if that person
[39:57] has decided to build a kingdom then I
[40:00] would suggest to you it's a Royal
[40:05] Kingdom and I we and if we believe that
[40:07] a royal person has built a Royal
[40:12] Kingdom and then and he has a royal
[40:16] law of and and that Royal law is a
[40:20] manifestation because James doesn't
[40:22] leave it as just some you know just some
[40:26] feel-good thought it's not just a
[40:28] thought bubble he actually describes it
[40:31] he says if you would keep the Royal law
[40:34] you're going to do this you're going to
[40:35] live like this you're not going to do
[40:37] this that or the other so it's not just
[40:40] a philosophy it's not just a a nice
[40:44] fuzzy way of thinking it actually if I'm
[40:47] going to say the Royal law given by the
[40:50] Royal person who's building a Royal
[40:52] Kingdom he obviously wants Royal
[40:55] subjects then that tells me that he's
[40:58] looking for a royal
[41:01] manifestation he's not looking for you
[41:04] know a word salad he's not just looking
[41:07] you know for a cliche the if there's a
[41:10] royal law then there ought to be a royal
[41:14] manifestation and I believe that James
[41:17] gets this word did got this description
[41:20] and chose this description because he
[41:23] saw true royalty up close amen amen I'm
[41:29] going to tell you something when you
[41:30] hang around Royal people you start
[41:32] thinking Royal thoughts you start
[41:35] talking when you're when you have become
[41:38] convinced that your father is a great
[41:40] king you remember the story brother Bram
[41:42] tells about the slave from Africa but he
[41:45] was different than the other ones and
[41:47] they said well why is he said because at
[41:49] home his father's a king and even though
[41:52] he's in a foreign land he knows who he
[41:54] is he knows his lineage and he conducts
[41:57] himself his life is a
[42:00] manifestation of his
[42:02] Heritage so I I think that James
[42:05] spending those years you know growing up
[42:09] alongside of Jesus and following him in
[42:12] his ministry he was able to see real
[42:16] royalty we're not talking about the
[42:18] royalty that the world conjures up and
[42:20] people just think that their royalty
[42:22] because somewhere back in their lineage
[42:25] uh their great ancestor was some type of
[42:28] a king and you know it's amazing that in
[42:31] the earth Wars have fought because
[42:33] there's a king and somebody else wants
[42:36] to be the king yeah and so they there's
[42:39] a Civil War and whoever wins is going to
[42:41] get to have a new king and that's that
[42:44] that lasts about as long and as as until
[42:47] another one comes along who says you
[42:49] know I think I'd like to be a king and
[42:51] he hires a bunch of troops and
[42:53] mercenaries and we got another War
[42:55] Europe Europe is replete with that kind
[42:59] of warfare and and and and a lot of
[43:02] times in families this goes all the way
[43:04] back to anytime there's a monarch you
[43:06] even find it in in the in the Kings of
[43:08] Israel in their sinful ways in the kings
[43:11] of Judah those backslid kings they would
[43:14] absolutely have their siblings
[43:17] murdered just so that they could not I
[43:20] mean when Herod is on the throne and he
[43:22] hears about a child born who's going to
[43:26] fulfill
[43:29] prophecy boy years old and
[43:33] down can you imagine having the kind of
[43:36] a manifestation to where you actually
[43:40] receive a prophecy and you have somebody
[43:43] come along and verify to you that
[43:45] they've been following a star and even
[43:48] the Supernatural is around the
[43:51] promise and and they're saying the
[43:53] Supernatural is proving to you that this
[43:56] today this scripture is fulfilled and
[43:58] you're going to try to commit
[44:01] murder sound
[44:04] familiar it's what we find from the very
[44:07] first days of the early church when that
[44:10] false Church began to go in they
[44:12] immediately Satan goes off of he he
[44:15] realizes he can't trick them and deceive
[44:17] them and get and G and gain all the ends
[44:19] that he wants to achieve so he jumps on
[44:22] a red horse and starts slaughtering
[44:25] them
[44:28] so Jesus says that the first great
[44:31] commandment is to love the Lord thy God
[44:35] with all your heart and all your soul
[44:39] and all your mind and I I think that
[44:43] this verse has never had more
[44:45] significance in the day and hour that we
[44:47] live in in
[44:49] 2024 than to say you need to love the
[44:52] Lord with your whole
[44:53] mind because this is an age of the the
[44:56] invasion of the minds of man and
[44:58] everything is designed to to bring your
[45:01] mind aside and put it on anything but
[45:04] the word of
[45:06] God I think we can witness
[45:10] that and he says the next thing that
[45:12] goes with loving God with all your heart
[45:15] soul and mind is that you love others as
[45:19] yourself so you so you can see that the
[45:23] influence of this Royal person
[45:26] giving out his Royal word and when
[45:29] people believe it one of the signs is
[45:33] that their life becomes
[45:35] Royal and and James picks this second
[45:38] this second thing up where Jesus said
[45:41] the first is love God the second is love
[45:43] your love your neighbor as yourself and
[45:45] that's what James picks up and calls the
[45:48] Royal
[45:50] law see so so there there's no way to he
[45:56] says you know if ye fulfill the Royal
[45:59] law according to the scripture Thou
[46:01] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so so
[46:05] as I said I think this this should prove
[46:07] to us clearly tonight that if we're if
[46:11] we're going to say that we're part of
[46:14] the royal family then our life ought to
[46:16] have a royal
[46:18] manifestation so now now I'm going
[46:21] Beyond just loving thy neighbor as
[46:23] thyself now it's all the law yeah see so
[46:28] so we find then that this is a royal
[46:32] manifestation that will be in the lives
[46:35] of all of those who are part of the
[46:38] royal
[46:40] family you you you'll you'll let me say
[46:43] it like this those will have a royal
[46:49] manifestation who love God with all
[46:51] their heart soul and mind amen can I say
[46:54] it in that direction that's just
[46:56] flipping it I'm inverting it now you're
[46:58] reading it one way and you're coming to
[47:00] a conclusion now I'm starting with a
[47:02] conclusion and I'm going back to the
[47:04] cause what would cause me to live the
[47:07] Royal law because I love God with all my
[47:10] heart my my mind my soul and everything
[47:13] is all about
[47:17] him so these are they who will fulfill
[47:22] the Royal law and they're the only ones
[47:25] Dr conable one of my favorite
[47:26] commentators I don't can't agree with
[47:28] him on everything of course like brother
[47:30] brandham said I he said I like old Dr
[47:32] scoffield he said no I don't agree with
[47:34] all of his notes he said but you know
[47:36] there there was some of them that
[47:37] brother brandham liked and one of my
[47:39] favorite for years has been Dr constable
[47:41] and he he says this in his lexical Aid
[47:44] the word Royal and he's got a breakdown
[47:46] of the Greek we're not going into it
[47:48] tonight but he says it like this the
[47:50] Royal law is
[47:53] Royal in that it is is the law of the
[47:57] king who heads the kingdom that
[48:00] Believers will
[48:02] inherit clear enough the Royal law is is
[48:07] Royal here's why it's Royal in that it
[48:10] is the law of the king who heads the
[48:13] kingdom that Believers will inherit what
[48:17] are you looking to inherit what are your
[48:19] future plans I can tell you my future
[48:22] plans don't involve staying around here
[48:24] my future home is is is not this world
[48:28] order I'm looking for a Royal Land
[48:31] Hallelujah with a royal
[48:35] order he goes on to say it is also Royal
[48:39] I thought these were astonishing reasons
[48:41] just really hit the nail on the head it
[48:43] is also Royal in that it is primary
[48:47] meaning that it governs all other laws
[48:51] dealing with human
[48:53] relationships am and he writes Matthew
[48:56] 2239 and Leviticus 19:18 if you want to
[48:59] make a
[49:00] reference so now we've got to come down
[49:04] and realize that that this is as I said
[49:07] to you already this is not just about
[49:09] treating your neighbor like yourself
[49:12] this is all other laws amen and it it it
[49:18] makes it a royal law because it's the
[49:22] primary law and if you are I'm saying as
[49:26] plain as I possibly can if if the Royal
[49:31] law is governing your life then all
[49:36] other laws of God's word are a part of
[49:39] your
[49:41] manifestation this is why the Apostle
[49:43] could say to the Believers because
[49:46] they're the only ones who can pull this
[49:48] off at least they're the ones that are
[49:49] supposed to be pulling it off that
[49:51] whatsoever you do in word or deed do all
[49:55] in the name of the Lord Jesus so I just
[49:57] simply say whatever I you can't do and
[50:01] and put the name of Jesus to it don't do
[50:04] it whatever you can't say in the name of
[50:08] Jesus don't say
[50:13] it now how do you speak to your
[50:16] neighbor now how do you speak to someone
[50:19] in the business
[50:20] world how do you speak to your
[50:24] spouse how do you speak to your children
[50:27] children how do you speak to Mom and Dad
[50:30] how do husbands speak to wives how do
[50:32] wives speak to husbands hey don't get
[50:34] quiet this is the Royal
[50:36] law you can say well you know I'm I'm
[50:39] born this I got this propensity brother
[50:41] brandham said he was
[50:43] Irish but the Holy Ghost quelled all of
[50:47] that he said all of his people were
[50:50] killers and drunkard but he wasn't like
[50:52] that see so don't don't tell me your her
[50:55] it AG or your nature or you know because
[50:57] the Holy Ghost brings down control Upon
[51:01] Our Lives
[51:03] amen I told you James was going to get
[51:06] up in your
[51:09] business Dr Constable goes on to say Let
[51:13] me let me read it in in in the flow that
[51:15] he gives it it's also the Royal in that
[51:17] it is primary it governs all other laws
[51:19] dealing with human relationships
[51:22] moreover it is conduct of a high
[51:26] order that is worthy of a
[51:29] king no wonder a prophet would come and
[51:32] preach a sermon is your life worthy of
[51:36] the Gospel come on Friends it don't do
[51:39] any good to say I'm a Believer and God
[51:41] sent a prophet where is the
[51:43] manifestation I already know you got a
[51:45] royal message you got a royal Christ is
[51:48] are you living a royal
[51:51] life Royal people surrender to their
[51:54] duties yeah even the ones who don't want
[51:57] it and it's a burden but they they have
[51:59] an
[52:03] obligation
[52:04] see so it is a a high order it's a
[52:09] conduct of high order that is worthy of
[52:13] a
[52:15] king another commentary that I on this
[52:19] verse that I thought was really good
[52:20] from the Bible knowledge commentary says
[52:22] James was
[52:24] aware that there would be some who would
[52:26] tend to dismiss their offense of
[52:29] prejudice as a trivial fault remember
[52:32] James said somebody will come in with a
[52:34] ring and gold and and fine clothes and
[52:36] you'll treat them a certain way and then
[52:38] the next man comes in who's poor and and
[52:41] filthy clothes and you just want to
[52:43] shuffle him off to a corner somewhere
[52:46] and and James is saying that's wrong
[52:48] respect of persons is wrong it's
[52:50] devilish it's evil listen friends if
[52:54] there was ever a time uh you're living
[52:56] in a world that is so polarized it's so
[52:59] divided it's so opposing if there was
[53:02] ever a time when we should live by all
[53:04] for one and one for all if there was
[53:07] ever I've been saying it for 30 years
[53:09] we're all in this thing together friends
[53:13] let's be together Let's Stay Together
[53:16] let's have families in harmony who are
[53:18] who are following the Royal
[53:23] lifestyle you see say he was
[53:27] aware that there would be some who would
[53:29] tend to dismiss their offense of
[53:31] prejudice as a trivial fault they would
[53:34] hardly consider themselves as law
[53:36] Breakers just because they showed a
[53:39] little favoritism we do that don't we
[53:43] well I'm mostly good I got a few little
[53:45] you
[53:46] know I'm you know it's not really not
[53:48] really a problem oh it's a
[53:50] problem see that's what James is point
[53:53] it's a problem
[53:56] the uh bkc goes on to say they would
[53:59] hardly consider themselves as law
[54:01] Breakers James went on to make it clear
[54:04] that this was no small offense whoever
[54:07] keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at
[54:11] just one point is guilty of breaking it
[54:18] all so there ain't no Little trivial
[54:21] things we're either Believers or we're
[54:23] not we're either going to keep God's
[54:25] word or we're not
[54:30] see in a message in 1955 the Waters of
[54:36] Separation I love this this gives me
[54:40] hope brother brandham
[54:43] says when we we always think of the
[54:48] color he's talking about the color of
[54:49] red he said that the red is danger he
[54:51] said red does signify danger or uh or
[54:55] life or so forth but read in the
[54:58] scripture signifies Redemption through
[55:00] the
[55:01] blood see now I want you to think just
[55:04] for a minute because I I ran a little
[55:07] test I I remember hearing brother
[55:08] brandham talk about and you know in his
[55:11] uneducated way and he kept apologizing
[55:13] for it he said if there's a scientist
[55:14] here he said I know you just Overlook me
[55:17] and I'm in my ignorance he said I'm just
[55:18] trying to make a a point and
[55:22] he you know had this that or this and
[55:26] it' be this color and and if you just
[55:28] changed a a couple little molecule
[55:30] numbers if you you know instead of
[55:32] instead of Sr 5- csy and instead you
[55:37] made it you know
[55:39] r3g and and and dash y Za he said then
[55:44] you could go from this color to that
[55:45] color to this color to that color and
[55:47] and it would be amazing with just a
[55:49] little
[55:50] variation how you could change the color
[55:52] and I I look I started looking into that
[55:55] that and there are some when you look at
[55:57] molecular formulas they there are some
[56:00] of them that are exceptionally
[56:01] dissimilar and they they're colors very
[56:03] W wildly but you know I I just I just
[56:07] took as an example and I didn't decided
[56:10] not to put it up on the screen tonight I
[56:11] just took red and blue and the first
[56:13] thing that I found out is that you know
[56:15] something I already knew and I thought
[56:17] yeah of course you know there's all
[56:19] different kinds of colors of red and all
[56:21] kinds of different colors of blue but
[56:23] just as an example there is is a color
[56:25] of red and a color of blue and when I
[56:28] looked at the mathematical or looked at
[56:30] the molecular formula just like brother
[56:33] brandham said they were almost identical
[56:35] just one or like seven or eight
[56:38] characters long maybe maybe a dozen
[56:40] characters long and only one or two or
[56:42] three of them were just different it had
[56:44] just one little different number and it
[56:46] went from red to
[56:48] blue so
[56:50] now this this makes me realize and I'm
[56:53] going to make a point here in a minute
[56:55] that what I'm saying now is going to be
[56:56] based on
[56:59] that God just didn't
[57:04] accidentally make
[57:06] colors they actually have a
[57:09] formula they're actually scientific
[57:12] they're very precise down to the
[57:15] molecule so much so that if he just
[57:18] changes one or two digits in a dozen
[57:20] digit long uh sequence it's a completely
[57:24] different color so God doesn't do
[57:27] anything
[57:29] accidentally all
[57:31] right so now brother brandham is saying
[57:35] red does signify danger but red in the
[57:37] scripture signifies Redemption through
[57:40] the blood so let me say it like this God
[57:43] made blood red on
[57:48] purpose he didn't make it blue or brown
[57:51] or green he made it red
[57:56] read in the scripture signifies
[57:57] Redemption through the blood Harlot
[57:59] Rahab would she put the Scarlet streak
[58:01] down and all she put a red a red streak
[58:03] a red cord All Through the Bible is a
[58:06] Scarlet streak Redemption catch this now
[58:09] this is the prophet with such an
[58:11] authority that everybody else could
[58:13] probe at it and probe at it and probe at
[58:15] it but here's a prophet coming and and
[58:18] certifying that Redemption comes through
[58:22] red say who decided that that the
[58:26] king the one who made red the one who
[58:30] literally created the formul and said
[58:33] this right here is going to be
[58:34] Redemption and and it can't be changed
[58:37] at all you you can't even add one little
[58:40] digit you can't change anything he's got
[58:42] one color for
[58:45] Redemption I want you to see the purpose
[58:49] that this is a Purpose Driven God who do
[58:51] who who does nothing without a a a royal
[58:55] reason oh my
[58:58] Hallelujah so he says Redemption comes
[59:01] through red through the shedding of the
[59:04] blood and without the shedding of blood
[59:06] there's no remission of
[59:09] sin and how that God said now here he
[59:13] goes again go and get this heer that's
[59:17] red all over so now he's
[59:21] decided that for the sacrificial animal
[59:25] for a certain type of sacrifice not just
[59:27] any sacrifice there all kinds of
[59:29] sacrifices in in in Leviticus but for
[59:33] this one particular this Redemption
[59:36] sacrifice it's got to be a sacrificial
[59:39] animal that's
[59:41] red all over and it can't even have any
[59:46] variation or any other
[59:49] colors so he
[59:51] says this he that's red all over were
[59:54] not one spot of anything else but
[59:59] perfectly
[1:00:00] red
[1:00:03] amen through the shedding of the blood
[1:00:05] and without the shedding of blood
[1:00:08] there's no remission of sin and how that
[1:00:12] God said okay I've read that all right
[1:00:14] and so he says and he says so God said
[1:00:17] get this heer that's red all over not
[1:00:18] one spot of anything else perfectly red
[1:00:20] for God looked through red and now he's
[1:00:23] going to go scientific on you and you
[1:00:26] know what and he says and you know what
[1:00:28] color is red looking through red red
[1:00:31] through red makes white try it one time
[1:00:34] we used to all do that in the cereal box
[1:00:36] I forget now what it came in you'd have
[1:00:38] the little goggles and you have the
[1:00:40] secret code and if you put the red
[1:00:42] goggles on you'd you'd see a red splotch
[1:00:45] and and you'd see the code uh you'd see
[1:00:48] the white the white lettering you
[1:00:50] couldn't see it when you took the red
[1:00:52] goggles off oh friends watch this now
[1:00:56] and he says for God looked through red
[1:01:00] and he says red through red makes white
[1:01:02] try it one time red through red produces
[1:01:05] white so when God looks through the
[1:01:07] blood of Jesus Christ to we who are
[1:01:10] Scarlet Red with sin and covered by the
[1:01:13] blood he sees us white as snow though
[1:01:16] your sins be red like Crimson for real
[1:01:19] for real they really are red like
[1:01:22] Crimson but because of the red blood of
[1:01:25] Jesus Christ he sees you as white as
[1:01:29] snow though your sins be read like
[1:01:32] Crimson they shall be white as snow this
[1:01:35] tells me that Redemption is not some
[1:01:37] accident brother brandom's just not
[1:01:38] going hey you know a neat little little
[1:01:41] funny thing here you know this isn't
[1:01:44] just a little bit of a little funny
[1:01:46] trivia guess what I figured out in the
[1:01:48] Bible no this is God before there was
[1:01:51] ever Stardust he already knew there was
[1:01:54] was going to be a lost people he already
[1:01:56] knew he was going to have a Redemption
[1:01:59] and when he creates blood he said now
[1:02:01] this is going to be a redeeming
[1:02:06] color I want you to understand friends
[1:02:09] that you're headed for Glory tonight
[1:02:12] because of a master plan you're not
[1:02:16] going accidentally you didn't become a
[1:02:18] Believer
[1:02:19] accidentally God thought about this
[1:02:24] he knew your sins would be like Scarlet
[1:02:27] so he had a remedy before the first sin
[1:02:30] was ever
[1:02:34] committed a red heer is not a product of
[1:02:37] evolution it's a product of
[1:02:41] creation blood isn't readed by
[1:02:44] accident you you you you and and and you
[1:02:47] take oxygen out of it and you start
[1:02:50] changing the color change it at all and
[1:02:52] you start changing color yesen see it's
[1:02:55] got to have life in it the fact that
[1:02:58] it's red means you're set free by a
[1:03:01] living
[1:03:03] Force so when God made blood
[1:03:06] red and when God made a sacrificial
[1:03:10] animal red he already knew there would
[1:03:15] be a
[1:03:16] Redemption of the Lost see and so so now
[1:03:20] under a prophetic
[1:03:23] microscope we see this compound meaning
[1:03:26] that that otherwise we wouldn't have
[1:03:28] known with
[1:03:30] certainty I could have stood up here and
[1:03:32] said you know I think maybe this could
[1:03:35] be lots of managed thinkers brilliant
[1:03:39] Beautiful Minds of men could could could
[1:03:42] have thought about that and probably did
[1:03:45] and it's probably in lexical AIDS in
[1:03:47] other places but I'm here to tell you
[1:03:49] something friends I'm not trusting in my
[1:03:51] wits or their wits because they got some
[1:03:54] stuff wrong and I get some stuff wrong
[1:03:57] I'm glad that I have a prophetic I have
[1:04:00] a prophetic
[1:04:02] utterance
[1:04:03] Hallelujah red stands for
[1:04:07] Redemption and so we see that
[1:04:11] Jesus is trying to this is why Jesus
[1:04:14] would come with such a a flat statement
[1:04:18] with no wiggle room you must be born
[1:04:22] again amen we've been laboring on this
[1:04:26] to we we were talking about it on Sunday
[1:04:28] and I referenced a conversation with a
[1:04:31] young man recently to say it's wonderful
[1:04:34] to come to church it's wonderful to sing
[1:04:38] songs it's it's it's wonderful to have
[1:04:41] the understanding of the Bible but you
[1:04:44] must be born again I'm glad you're here
[1:04:48] but you must be born again he said
[1:04:51] brother Jason I'm glad you're my pastor
[1:04:54] thank you but you must be born
[1:04:56] again
[1:04:59] hallelujah it's a
[1:05:01] command it's a requirement it's
[1:05:04] definitely not a
[1:05:06] recommendation It's Not Mere advice so
[1:05:09] we find that from sini Paul deals with
[1:05:12] this in Hebrews 2 we're not going to uh
[1:05:15] take the time to go there tonight but
[1:05:18] from sini Paul Paul talks about there
[1:05:21] that how that we live under the rule of
[1:05:24] law from sini and that every
[1:05:28] transgression and
[1:05:30] Disobedience received a just recompense
[1:05:35] of reward I call it I call it uh sin uh
[1:05:39] is the fair wages uh the the fair wages
[1:05:42] of sin is a retirement fund uh just as
[1:05:46] those in
[1:05:48] Sodom received in their flesh all the
[1:05:52] Corruptions naturally yeah they received
[1:05:55] penalty in their flesh naturally people
[1:05:59] who live in sin suffer naturally in
[1:06:01] their flesh everybody who lives a life a
[1:06:05] committed life that's against God's word
[1:06:07] sin pays
[1:06:10] wages and those who have been in hell
[1:06:13] are spending their
[1:06:15] retirement they earned it well they
[1:06:18] built up a big
[1:06:20] account and some of them built up larger
[1:06:23] accounts than others I was looking at a
[1:06:28] at a documentary on the first nerenberg
[1:06:32] trial and they executed 10 from the
[1:06:36] Third Reich of the Nazi the Nazi regime
[1:06:38] there and and of course they had second
[1:06:40] and third different ones of the
[1:06:42] nerenberg trials this was the very first
[1:06:44] one of course sikan they didn't have
[1:06:46] Hitler had committed suicide they didn't
[1:06:48] have him so they couldn't bring him to
[1:06:49] trial but they brought everybody else to
[1:06:51] trial from guring on down
[1:06:55] and we find that l a little while later
[1:06:59] they caught some of them in hiding and
[1:07:00] they brought them to trial and then they
[1:07:02] caught some more and brought them to
[1:07:03] trial and so I I don't want to get off
[1:07:05] into
[1:07:07] the that all the 10 that were executed
[1:07:12] and and were executed by
[1:07:15] hanging that there was only one only one
[1:07:18] I I could hardly believe it that they
[1:07:21] they literally recorded here their
[1:07:23] standing on The
[1:07:25] Gallows and the The Noose is around
[1:07:28] their neck and they're just getting
[1:07:30] ready to put the black hood over their
[1:07:31] face and they
[1:07:33] say would do you have any last
[1:07:37] words I mean you're done you're on the
[1:07:42] Gallows The Noose is around your neck
[1:07:44] this isn't going to go any other way but
[1:07:47] one
[1:07:48] way do you have any last words and and
[1:07:51] all of them would say you know where I I
[1:07:54] love Germany and I love the Fatherland
[1:07:56] and I I pray God's blessing upon the
[1:07:59] German people and and and then some of
[1:08:01] them just they said you have any last
[1:08:03] words
[1:08:04] no and only one there was one elderly
[1:08:07] man he had been part of the H of the
[1:08:10] command chain and he his the first words
[1:08:13] out of his mouth were I pray that God
[1:08:17] have mercy on my
[1:08:19] soul only one out of 10 amen and that
[1:08:23] was the first thing he said in
[1:08:25] confessing his guilt of of these crimes
[1:08:28] against humanity he said I pray that God
[1:08:31] forgive my
[1:08:33] soul and and forgive Germany and help
[1:08:37] help her to be healed and
[1:08:40] reunited and we followed leaders who
[1:08:44] weren't soldiers and they were they were
[1:08:46] of evil intent and he's admitting all of
[1:08:48] this and he's the only
[1:08:50] one say what is going to be his outcome
[1:08:54] he'll get a fair trial I know that and
[1:08:57] just before they pulled the black hood
[1:08:59] over his face he turned to the chaplain
[1:09:01] and he said in a low voice I'll see you
[1:09:07] again so we find then that the fair
[1:09:10] wages of
[1:09:13] sin can't be refused as a
[1:09:17] wage you've got to once you earn them
[1:09:20] you've got to spend them suffering in
[1:09:23] the the regions of the
[1:09:26] lost I I also I didn't watch the whole
[1:09:29] thing I was I was I had a purpose and
[1:09:32] intent I was looking for a certain thing
[1:09:34] and I came across this man and you you
[1:09:39] know the internet is filled with these
[1:09:41] testimonies and different churches put
[1:09:43] them out and and of near-death
[1:09:46] experiences you know brother branam had
[1:09:48] not just a near-death experience he had
[1:09:50] an afterdeath experience Hallelujah and
[1:09:53] actually he had a near-death experience
[1:09:55] where he descended into the lower parts
[1:09:56] of the earth and he says it was a
[1:09:58] haunting it was the most horrible thing
[1:10:00] he said he said I'd rather have hot
[1:10:02] wires run through my body than to ever
[1:10:05] go than to spend five minutes
[1:10:08] there he said it's real friends don't
[1:10:11] ever let anyone tell you it's not a real
[1:10:14] place and this man who had who had died
[1:10:19] in an explosion and he he he they they
[1:10:24] managed to get him back later but he he
[1:10:26] tells how that when he flew from the
[1:10:31] explos and a a furnace exploded gas and
[1:10:34] it blew him backwards and he said I was
[1:10:37] up out of my body and he said I looked
[1:10:39] around and I saw that I had died in an
[1:10:43] explosion and he says now that matches
[1:10:46] what brother brandham said he said I
[1:10:47] looked back and there was my body and I
[1:10:48] thought oh I've died see so this is not
[1:10:52] uncommon brother brother brandham even
[1:10:54] in one quote he talks about how that
[1:10:56] when when a spirit leaves the body it
[1:10:58] hangs around the body for a little bit
[1:10:59] trying to get back
[1:11:01] in and and so he says he says
[1:11:06] immediately bursting into my room they
[1:11:09] came right through the
[1:11:11] wall he he starts talking about these
[1:11:14] two large very grotesque looking
[1:11:18] beings now and he he goes on I'm gonna
[1:11:21] say a little bit more in a moment but
[1:11:24] that caught my
[1:11:25] attention when he starts talking about
[1:11:28] these two very large grotesque beings
[1:11:32] and brother brandom in demonology
[1:11:34] describes that demons have different
[1:11:35] appearances depending on what kind of
[1:11:37] demon they are I got a quote here on
[1:11:40] demonology I'm going to read this in a
[1:11:41] moment if I don't run out of time you
[1:11:43] all
[1:11:45] right and and so I that caught my
[1:11:49] attention when he talks about the they
[1:11:51] were very large and they were very gross
[1:11:53] and and ghoulish looking and and I and I
[1:11:57] remembered
[1:11:59] immediately it took me back I was I was
[1:12:01] a young boy and I was having a dream and
[1:12:03] the Lord's dealt with me in spiritual
[1:12:05] dreams all my life and I and he's get
[1:12:08] told me things and I was able to reveal
[1:12:10] things to people and solve cases not
[1:12:12] only in my children but as a pastor and
[1:12:15] even even there you you you've come to
[1:12:18] me members of my church have come to me
[1:12:20] with a dream and I would say you know
[1:12:24] let's pray and see what the Lord will do
[1:12:27] and see if he'll show me the dream now
[1:12:28] that's only the purview of a prophet who
[1:12:30] sees the dream you had and I'm certainly
[1:12:33] not a prophet but I wondered one time
[1:12:35] with a gift of dream would God do that
[1:12:38] and he did and I was able to set a
[1:12:40] brother down and I was able to go back
[1:12:42] and tell him parts of the dream he left
[1:12:44] out and he said my goodness you really
[1:12:47] saw my dream I said I did now here's the
[1:12:49] interpretation because you're Miser
[1:12:52] understanding the dream you're you're
[1:12:53] very frightened over it but you don't
[1:12:55] have to be because you remember this
[1:12:57] this this he goes yes I saidwell this is
[1:12:59] what it meant not what you think
[1:13:01] amen so so we find that that I the Lord
[1:13:07] dealt with me in very powerful dreams
[1:13:09] and I was just a
[1:13:10] lad and I I remember having a dream that
[1:13:13] caught my attention like this man and in
[1:13:16] the dream I was walking in a dark place
[1:13:19] and I a long vast expanse of void it's
[1:13:23] only I can say it was all dark and I
[1:13:26] could tell I was moving through it and
[1:13:28] far in the distance I saw a light I
[1:13:31] thought what is that it's way in the
[1:13:32] distance and I I probably couldn't have
[1:13:35] been much more than Enoch's age here and
[1:13:39] as I'm walking and as I start getting
[1:13:41] close I see that there are two
[1:13:44] staircases and and they and they
[1:13:47] basically are side by side at ground
[1:13:50] level and one of them turns and goes up
[1:13:53] upward and disappears and another one
[1:13:55] goes and turns downward and I can see
[1:13:58] red
[1:13:58] glow and up here I can see bright
[1:14:02] light and as I'm walking there's a man
[1:14:05] sitting on this
[1:14:07] side and he's a very ghoulish looking
[1:14:11] creature and as he as I'm approaching he
[1:14:14] looks up and he says oh I see we have
[1:14:17] another one and I knew what that meant
[1:14:21] my parents had taught me the way and and
[1:14:24] things about uh demonology my mother
[1:14:26] taught us from a very young age that the
[1:14:29] devil was real and hell wasn't a figment
[1:14:31] of imagination it wasn't just some some
[1:14:34] hazy thing it was an actual
[1:14:37] place and as soon as he said oh we've
[1:14:39] got another one I immediately went to
[1:14:42] stop and when I did I realized something
[1:14:44] lifted me and I looked like this and
[1:14:47] there it was two very large ghoulish
[1:14:51] grotesque looking when this man said two
[1:14:54] very large beings came in very ghoulish
[1:14:58] had Claws and and and and suddenly I
[1:15:01] realized and they were carrying me
[1:15:03] towards the downward
[1:15:06] staircase and I was kicking and
[1:15:08] screaming for all I was worth I remember
[1:15:11] like it was yesterday and it you know
[1:15:14] what it reminded me it it I they were
[1:15:17] they were very large and they were
[1:15:20] covered in Long Grizzly hair hair I
[1:15:24] remember that so vividly just like head
[1:15:26] to toe I can tell you this they didn't
[1:15:29] look like
[1:15:30] Angels amen let me just say it that way
[1:15:34] they didn't look like
[1:15:37] Gabriel oh my and they're carrying me
[1:15:41] towards and right as we got near the
[1:15:43] banister and they're going to take me
[1:15:45] down I somehow managed to make a kick
[1:15:47] and twist and jerk and I broke free of
[1:15:51] their grip now you don't can imagine
[1:15:53] where I
[1:15:54] headed I ran around the banister and
[1:15:56] with them trying to reach and grab me
[1:15:58] and up that staircase I went and they
[1:16:01] started chasing me as hard as they could
[1:16:03] and I was running and I was fast as the
[1:16:05] wind when I was a kid and I'm running up
[1:16:07] those steps and they're right on my
[1:16:09] heels and right as I break into the top
[1:16:13] there stands the biggest most beautiful
[1:16:15] look Gabriel looking angel big giant
[1:16:20] white Wings enormous and he's just
[1:16:22] standing there and I stopped and they
[1:16:24] stopped and everybody
[1:16:27] froze and he looked at
[1:16:30] me and he looked at them and he just
[1:16:35] went and they turned around and went
[1:16:38] back down and the last thing as I woke
[1:16:41] up I was walking into the
[1:16:46] entrance it stayed with me as a boy all
[1:16:48] my life never forgot
[1:16:51] that and and they covered you know I I I
[1:16:56] remember that that brother brandham
[1:16:57] talked about the the demon of
[1:17:01] alcoholism that came out of of of
[1:17:04] rosella
[1:17:05] Griffin sister Rosella Griffin and and
[1:17:09] he said it had long hair just like that
[1:17:11] when when I heard that as a boy when I
[1:17:12] heard that on tape I went wow that's
[1:17:15] exactly like what I saw they didn't look
[1:17:18] like bats and brother brandham said not
[1:17:19] all demons look the
[1:17:21] same and so but but I remember that that
[1:17:24] very long hair I remember brother Keith
[1:17:26] Brown giving a description one time of a
[1:17:29] woman who was delivered of
[1:17:31] cigarettes and I'm not here to to to
[1:17:33] give kids bad dreams but it was brother
[1:17:36] it affected brother Keith and he was
[1:17:39] praying and I was standing on the front
[1:17:40] row I wasn't even minister at the time
[1:17:43] and he was down with a brother from
[1:17:44] Haiti and those Haitian pastors man
[1:17:47] they're used to busting heads with
[1:17:48] demons and he's I remember that Haitian
[1:17:51] pastor is just saying in the the name of
[1:17:53] Jesus Christ I command you in the name
[1:17:56] of Jesus Christ and brother Keith is
[1:17:58] down there praying and in the name of
[1:18:00] Jesus Christ and all of a sudden I saw
[1:18:02] brother Keith stagger backwards and like
[1:18:04] get out of the way no one knew what
[1:18:07] happened but that woman was free in a
[1:18:09] moment and he told it the next morning
[1:18:12] in the service he said friends he said
[1:18:15] when that brother was casting that devil
[1:18:18] out of her he said what Rose up out of
[1:18:21] her he said it was the most horrible and
[1:18:23] he talked about that Grizzly that long
[1:18:26] hair it had that grizzly long hair and
[1:18:29] he said it was just like a puppet it was
[1:18:30] like Jello-O it was like going like this
[1:18:33] it had it had just become disembodied
[1:18:35] this is this is not this is not a fairy
[1:18:37] tale this is real life and he said it
[1:18:40] wiggled and wiggled and went through the
[1:18:42] wall I saw that happen right here saw a
[1:18:44] demon come up out of his sister and take
[1:18:46] off right through the window the old
[1:18:47] window that used to be
[1:18:50] there and so so you you see these things
[1:18:54] and brother Brandon picks it up here he
[1:18:56] says I'm writing a book if you if I can
[1:18:59] you I don't I don't know whether you'll
[1:19:01] be
[1:19:03] a on demonology personal contact with
[1:19:06] demons friends they're just as real as
[1:19:08] you just as real as you're real and I
[1:19:12] see them many times when they leave
[1:19:14] right I seen them come right off the
[1:19:15] platform I see them some of them in the
[1:19:17] shape of bat some of them see look like
[1:19:20] long hairs hanging on their legs but
[1:19:22] epileptic demon looks like a tortoise
[1:19:25] with round legs hanging up like that but
[1:19:28] usually and then he goes to a demon of
[1:19:30] Oppression these suicide demons he said
[1:19:34] a demon of Oppression seems to be more
[1:19:37] like a cloud form like a wave and it
[1:19:40] just makes a real funny sound when
[1:19:42] you're when you're in that other other
[1:19:44] dimension to see that
[1:19:46] Spirit now you may think that's wrong
[1:19:49] but some of these days you'll realize if
[1:19:51] you could only take a SP spiritual
[1:19:53] Looking Glass and look now watch this
[1:19:55] watch him turn the corner on us he said
[1:19:57] if you could only take a spiritual
[1:19:59] Looking Glass and look into your soul no
[1:20:03] doubt you'd find out what it looks like
[1:20:05] and the greatest devil now he's talking
[1:20:07] about bats and tortoises and waves and
[1:20:11] depression and like little clouds that
[1:20:13] make a funny sound but now he comes on
[1:20:16] he says but now the greatest devil the
[1:20:20] chief of all Devils is unbelief
[1:20:23] amen and it lives in the soul of people
[1:20:28] amen I I was going to put it on the
[1:20:30] screen tonight but again I didn't want
[1:20:32] to send children home with bad dreams I
[1:20:35] don't know if you ever remember way back
[1:20:36] in I think in the 1930s I remember years
[1:20:39] ago uh seeing and I don't even remember
[1:20:41] the name of it for sure but it was
[1:20:43] something about Dorian Gray and he he
[1:20:45] stood in a mirror and he he he thought
[1:20:48] he was young but he was actually
[1:20:50] decrepit and and the evil that was in in
[1:20:52] his heart was turning him ghoulish until
[1:20:55] one day he looked in the mirror and he
[1:20:57] saw his real gaunt self I'm here to tell
[1:21:00] you friends people don't have a
[1:21:02] spiritual mirror like that but we do
[1:21:04] have the word and let me tell you you
[1:21:06] don't want to see a fallen soul in it's
[1:21:09] a spiritual mirror just look in God's
[1:21:12] word and say Lord I don't want to be
[1:21:14] that
[1:21:15] person I want to be full of the spirit
[1:21:18] of God I want to have the law of Liberty
[1:21:21] I want to have the Royal law working
[1:21:24] inside of
[1:21:26] me cuz the worst one is in the soul and
[1:21:29] it's unbelief he said that's the only
[1:21:31] sin there is there's no doubt sin
[1:21:33] there's no other sin but unbelief all
[1:21:34] these little morals and things smoking
[1:21:36] drinking gambling committing adultery
[1:21:38] that's just attributes you do that
[1:21:41] because you don't believe unbeliever is
[1:21:42] what makes you do it if you was a
[1:21:44] Believer you wouldn't do it that's right
[1:21:46] and this man that I was watching his
[1:21:49] testimony I didn't complete it cuz I
[1:21:51] wasn't there for that purpose I just
[1:21:53] caught a few of the
[1:21:55] details but the thing that astonished
[1:21:59] him was to was to find out that although
[1:22:04] he was he was
[1:22:06] incredulous that these big ghoulish
[1:22:10] beings were coming after him because he
[1:22:13] he said I've been in church for
[1:22:16] years he said I'm talking about he said
[1:22:18] I've been in church I pay my tithe I I
[1:22:21] sing in the choir do all of these things
[1:22:23] he said you know I I I do this and I do
[1:22:26] that but he but he realized in that
[1:22:29] moment in that moment when he was H when
[1:22:31] he was having his near-death experience
[1:22:33] and he's looking down on his body that's
[1:22:35] just been blown up and here comes these
[1:22:38] gouls right through his living room wall
[1:22:39] to take him and he said they had
[1:22:43] shackles and they were going to put them
[1:22:45] on me and and he was so
[1:22:48] astonished to to and he realized in that
[1:22:51] moment in that moment that he had been
[1:22:54] in church for years but he he did not
[1:22:57] have What it Took amen at that moment
[1:23:00] amen he was missing that personal
[1:23:04] experience with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:07] that's why we're preaching that's why
[1:23:08] we're talking about it SUNY that's why I
[1:23:10] sat across from a young man I said you
[1:23:12] must be born again it's good that we
[1:23:15] love this church it's good that we love
[1:23:16] each other it's good that we've got
[1:23:18] wonderful families and great ministry
[1:23:20] but you must be born again
[1:23:23] it's good to believe God sent a prophet
[1:23:25] it's good to believe all the truth but
[1:23:27] you must be born
[1:23:29] again oh God give us an oldfashioned
[1:23:32] outpouring of the Holy Ghost upon our
[1:23:36] young people Upon Our married people
[1:23:38] that's what I want to see in this
[1:23:41] assembly a fresh
[1:23:45] outpouring he protested that he had been
[1:23:48] a good person he's trying to trying to
[1:23:50] reason with these ghouls he protested
[1:23:52] that he had been a good person he
[1:23:54] considered himself a
[1:23:57] Christian he said when I protested he
[1:24:00] said I was shown a long long
[1:24:04] list of offenses that I had committed
[1:24:07] since I was a child this is his
[1:24:11] testimony he
[1:24:13] said the thing that astonished him the
[1:24:16] most is how
[1:24:19] trivial they seemed just like when James
[1:24:22] was writing lest the Believers think
[1:24:25] it's just trivial to show respect of
[1:24:28] persons and James says it's not trivial
[1:24:33] it's
[1:24:34] serious and he said they showed me a
[1:24:37] long list of Minor
[1:24:39] offenses he said things that you know
[1:24:42] I'd stolen that I I didn't really think
[1:24:45] amounted to anything you know nobody
[1:24:46] would miss it it was no big deal and he
[1:24:49] said he said I was even shown harsh
[1:24:53] words that I had
[1:24:57] uttered just giving somebody the
[1:24:59] business you know telling somebody off
[1:25:01] he said he said there was even one on
[1:25:03] the list where I had been in a in a
[1:25:06] checkout line at a store and he said I
[1:25:08] had grown impatient with the store clerk
[1:25:11] because she was taking too long to give
[1:25:13] me a
[1:25:15] receipt and he said I snaap some rude
[1:25:18] comments to her and these harsh words
[1:25:21] and and and even just imp patience and
[1:25:24] and he says because and this this
[1:25:27] thought this answer blew me away he says
[1:25:29] because that that wasn't
[1:25:32] love that wasn't love just harsh words
[1:25:37] and those demons have a list of it it's
[1:25:40] there's a record of it amen that's why I
[1:25:43] said friends whatsoever you do in word
[1:25:45] or deed all must be done in the name of
[1:25:49] Jesus spouses can't speak to a spouse
[1:25:52] and hatred and anger and Venom and and
[1:25:55] and children and to parents and parents
[1:25:57] to children neighbors to neighbors
[1:26:00] employers to employees you know work
[1:26:02] Associates Business Associates we're
[1:26:05] we're supposed to have the law the Royal
[1:26:07] law living in our lives our homes are
[1:26:11] supposed to be governed by the token
[1:26:13] we're not supposed to offend the holy
[1:26:19] spirit because it wasn't love he wasn't
[1:26:21] living the Royal law and what James said
[1:26:25] in chapter two comes into play for
[1:26:29] whosoever shall keep the whole
[1:26:31] law and yet offend in one point he is
[1:26:36] guilty of
[1:26:43] all I'm gonna turn a
[1:26:46] corner I'm going to run for the finish
[1:26:48] line and you're going to be
[1:26:51] glad because at this point if I didn't
[1:26:56] have what I'm getting ready to go
[1:27:00] to I would just have I thought about
[1:27:02] this today I was out working in my yard
[1:27:04] and I was thinking about these notes and
[1:27:06] I thought wow this is so
[1:27:09] tight that I'm just going to have to
[1:27:12] tell the whole church I'm sorry I don't
[1:27:15] think any of us are going to make
[1:27:17] it me included it's just too tight
[1:27:23] and I I I just thought I would have to
[1:27:26] if I didn't have the answer I would have
[1:27:28] to come here and apologize and say
[1:27:30] friends for 30 years I've tried to get
[1:27:34] you to Perfection and I haven't even
[1:27:36] been able to get myself there and I'm
[1:27:39] sorry but it looks like none of us are
[1:27:41] going to make
[1:27:46] it brother brandham goes on in the water
[1:27:48] of Separation here's your here's your
[1:27:51] remedy from
[1:27:53] fainting he said God looking through the
[1:27:58] blood he doesn't see you no more as a
[1:28:02] sinner he sees you
[1:28:06] redeemed amen you're redeemed because
[1:28:12] you mean there's a reason yeah you're
[1:28:14] redeemed
[1:28:16] because he's always seen you through
[1:28:21] Christ
[1:28:23] Hallelujah that's the reason we can be
[1:28:27] perfect GL not perfect in the sense of
[1:28:31] sinlessness we're perfect in the eyes of
[1:28:35] God when we're in Christ you see why I
[1:28:39] keep saying it you must be born
[1:28:42] again see not not not perfect in the
[1:28:46] sense of sinlessness we're perfect in
[1:28:49] the eyes of God when we're in Christ
[1:28:52] that's the reason he said be ye
[1:28:55] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:28:58] Heaven is
[1:29:01] perfect now brother
[1:29:05] brandham moves to chapter
[1:29:09] 10 of Paul coming here and he says Paul
[1:29:13] in the 10th chapter of Hebrews now don't
[1:29:16] lose sight of the fact that Hebrews
[1:29:19] chapter
[1:29:20] 10 is is the setup to come to
[1:29:24] MDC all right now
[1:29:26] watch Hebrews trying to explain the law
[1:29:29] Paul's trying to explain the law having
[1:29:32] a shadow of good things to come not the
[1:29:36] very image of the things could never
[1:29:38] make the cun too perfect because God was
[1:29:41] looking through animal blood but now he
[1:29:44] looks through the blood of his son
[1:29:47] Perfection come by Jesus Christ now I'm
[1:29:50] not perfect in your your sight you may
[1:29:54] not be perfect in my sight but what
[1:29:57] about in God's sight that's where it
[1:30:00] lays and if you're born again into the
[1:30:03] body of Christ then God looks upon you
[1:30:07] as perfect as Christ was
[1:30:12] himself amen says Amen to his own
[1:30:15] statement nothing you can do it's not by
[1:30:19] any works that you can do at all it's by
[1:30:23] Grace God has given you this offer and
[1:30:26] if you've accepted it in the sight of
[1:30:29] God you are perfect redeemed washed in
[1:30:33] the blood of the Lamb without fault
[1:30:36] without blemish without
[1:30:42] spot that
[1:30:45] marvous Lord see because now he's moving
[1:30:49] to the order of MDC and I
[1:30:52] I I I didn't carry on in the quotee
[1:30:54] although I I could have um Let me let me
[1:30:58] let me read this last one perfect
[1:30:59] strength by Perfect
[1:31:01] weakness that's that's the way God wants
[1:31:04] us realize that we are totally
[1:31:08] insufficient then God takes the person
[1:31:10] and begins to mold himself into that
[1:31:13] person makes his hands do what God would
[1:31:16] have hands do makes his lips
[1:31:19] speak what God's lips would speak
[1:31:22] because they're not his they're
[1:31:26] Gods your hands don't belong to you your
[1:31:29] feet don't belong to you your eyes your
[1:31:32] ears your your lips your speech doesn't
[1:31:36] belong to you it belongs to
[1:31:39] him see there God whatever make his lips
[1:31:44] speak what God's lips would speak
[1:31:47] because they're not his they're God's
[1:31:49] watch this ending statement he begins to
[1:31:53] build a
[1:31:55] character begins to take this weakness
[1:31:59] and to make his own
[1:32:03] self he takes my weaknesses and makes me
[1:32:07] into
[1:32:08] him makes you into his own self see and
[1:32:13] so so when he so this is exactly why
[1:32:16] it's so significant that he comes to MDC
[1:32:20] because remember friends
[1:32:22] you you do do you remember you you you
[1:32:25] you remember how that and I let me I
[1:32:28] think I got a scripture here
[1:32:31] uh yeah Genesis
[1:32:34] 49:10 the scepter shall not depart from
[1:32:38] Judah nor a lawgiver from between his
[1:32:42] feet until Shiloh come and unto him
[1:32:46] shall be the Gathering of the
[1:32:48] people and shall shall the Gathering of
[1:32:50] the people be
[1:32:52] so he's he's a
[1:32:54] lawgiver this is what Christ is when you
[1:32:57] come into the order of mezc you're
[1:33:00] coming into the order of the
[1:33:02] lawgiver you say why is that significant
[1:33:04] because brother brandham said that I'm
[1:33:06] above the law he said see I I if if if
[1:33:10] there's a speed limit that says you
[1:33:12] can't go but this fast he said but if
[1:33:14] I'm not bound by that law I can go fast
[1:33:16] as I want cuz I'm not subject to the law
[1:33:19] and there's no he calls it a two-bit
[1:33:21] policeman can give me a ticket he says
[1:33:23] and he he references because mayor
[1:33:26] vissing had given brother brandham a
[1:33:28] mayoral privilege to break any speed
[1:33:31] limit he needed to on his way to an
[1:33:33] emergency Richard vissing did that
[1:33:35] called the whole police force if you see
[1:33:37] that Ford that black Ford Bill brandom
[1:33:39] driving it don't you ever stop him
[1:33:41] because I have confidence that he would
[1:33:43] not be speeding unless he was trying to
[1:33:45] get to a deathbed or hospital or
[1:33:48] something like that and brother brandham
[1:33:49] said now I'm above the law yeah he said
[1:33:52] the law has no bearing on me that makes
[1:33:55] sense because I've been brought under
[1:33:57] the
[1:33:58] lawgiver and and now I'm part of the
[1:34:00] lawgiver the law can't apply to
[1:34:03] me you remember the scripture that said
[1:34:06] that that he put all things under his
[1:34:08] feet he said but when he said he put all
[1:34:12] things under his feet it is accepted in
[1:34:15] other words there's an exception that it
[1:34:18] is accepted that he who put all things
[1:34:21] under his feet is not under his feet
[1:34:23] because God is going to be all in all it
[1:34:25] is accepted that I am part of the
[1:34:28] lawgiver I'm not subject to the law
[1:34:31] because of the order of
[1:34:34] MDC you see friends let me just say it
[1:34:37] it's plain as I possibly can mezc had no
[1:34:41] father he had no mother he had no
[1:34:44] beginning of days he had no ending of
[1:34:47] life he abideth continually a priest
[1:34:51] because I'm I'm under the order of mezic
[1:34:54] now it doesn't matter how I was born it
[1:34:56] doesn't matter how I die and all the
[1:34:59] chaos in the middle it doesn't count
[1:35:03] because I'm in the order of
[1:35:06] MDC I have no beginning I have no ending
[1:35:10] none of my life counts against me I am
[1:35:14] redeemed under the blood of the Lamb I
[1:35:17] have looked God looked at Red through
[1:35:20] red and sees me white as
[1:35:23] snow oh Hallelujah friends you don't
[1:35:27] have to go to that horrible place you
[1:35:28] don't have to have ghouls coming after
[1:35:30] you oh you can be Redeemed by the blood
[1:35:34] of the
[1:35:35] Lamb there's hope for us tonight can we
[1:35:38] make it no but in him I've already made
[1:35:41] it can I overcome it nothing doing but
[1:35:45] in him I'm already an
[1:35:47] overcomer let's stand
[1:35:50] friends
[1:35:52] life without eternal life is a poor
[1:35:59] deal that's that's a that is that is so
[1:36:03] stacked you don't want that because you
[1:36:06] can't do anything about it you can't fix
[1:36:09] it you can't escape it you got one
[1:36:12] destination you got one appointment with
[1:36:16] large ghoulish looking beings who want
[1:36:18] to take you like they wanted to take me
[1:36:21] like they wanted to take this man and
[1:36:24] this man said goes on I didn't like I
[1:36:27] said I didn't hear it but he starts
[1:36:28] talking about how that God the spirit of
[1:36:29] God rescued him the next thing he knows
[1:36:32] he was in a hospital being
[1:36:34] revived and he and he comes back to give
[1:36:37] his testimony bow your heads all over

[1:51:31] bridge he said probably several hundred
[1:51:33] yards long across the
[1:51:35] river and he said right as I hit that
[1:51:37] soon as I got up on the bridge he said
[1:51:39] it's very narrow and he said right as I
[1:51:41] hit this end of it a tractor and trailer

[1:51:45] me and he said all of a sudden the left
[1:51:48] rear tire blew he said I Heard It Go
[1:51:49] Boom boom and he said all of the sudden
[1:51:52] the whole car started turning sideways
[1:51:54] and I'm sliding sideways and this truck
[1:51:57] is burying right on top of
[1:51:59] me he just picked up his fork and went
