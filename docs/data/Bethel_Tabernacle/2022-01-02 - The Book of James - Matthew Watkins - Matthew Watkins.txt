TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so do you um practical james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greeting my brethren count on all joy when you fall into diverse temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience you can be seated this morning you could put my powerpoint up if you could brothers and i don't the clicker was here got it here and i'll control it book of james is some of the most practical christianity that you could read in the bible in the new testament especially if you want to see real true application the book of james really covers it and we're just going to study it just for this uh this morning we'll do an overview and then we'll break into some good really good teaching some solid teaching on the book but nuts and bolts we have that phrase we say where the rubber meets the road and you know that's just uh phrases that we could use to where we're talking about something that's realistic something that's very um just where life really is and when you read james that's really what you find you find a person who's speaking uh right where you live i mean right where you're at very realistic real living it's no nonsense christianity and i believe that we should be no nonsense christians there's a lot of nonsense christianity in the world today but james really preaches and teaches a very realistic christian life day to day to day-to-day on a day-to-day daily basis and there's not much doctrinal stuff if you read the entire book there's not really a lot of doctrine in the book but you know what there is and this is this is what's amazing when you study it there's not a lot of doctrine but there's a lot of teaching on behavior and it's incredible because when you look at this and and even if you just um you realize one of the truths that are one of the core truths that you draw from the book of james is that behavior is a vital vital part of a believer it's vital and i'll say this as vital as doctrine because if your doctrine doesn't produce behavior like christ then what good is your doctrine and so you could sum up the entire book of james and and uh just reading it last night i'm i'm just smiling at some of these notes that i wrote as i was reading it because it's incredible i've read portions of james but never one book collectively and it's incredible you could sum up the entire book of james with one word do you one word do you you'll hear that that verse that we know so well be ye doers of the word and not just hearers you could sum up the whole book as saying just do in fact if you underline the word do dio in your bible from genesis to revelation i think you'd be blown away with how many references the entire bible makes with the word do you what you'll find is that it's actually a key word to the entire bible isn't that incredible not just here but do what you've heard and i i want to say lord i want to be a doer i want to be a doer we underline it's incredible we underlined the big words in our bible justification and sanctification and revelation and we miss these little simple words and and i believe the little simple word do this is going to rhyme but i didn't mean it to the simple word do is the glue it's what pieces it all together because without it you just have what the bible says the letter killeth intellect kills but the spirit giveth life so you you you believe you see that do in james you have this challenge that uh and he's challenging you uh you and me today as i teach on this lesson here he's challenged challenging us to be not just hearers of what we've heard but doers of what we heard and i love the book when you read the entire book i love it because it's not it's not intellectual it's not academic it's not it's not a teaching there's a lot of things that could be taught and and we could look at different things but i love james because it's not it's not intellectual it's not loaded with intellect or how to be a smarter person you know let me say this the bible doesn't make you smarter there's a lot of books that you can read in this world that make you smarter the bible's not one of them you won't be smarter by reading it but you will be wiser and the bible doesn't give you intellect it gives you wisdom and james doesn't offer any kind of intellect or academic thing that you can learn but he does offer loads of wisdom and and it's so incredible i just take just a moment to make that point reading and learning reading reading and studying the bible doesn't make you a smarter person in fact it doesn't intend there's no intent to make you a smarter person but reading that brings wisdom and that's why that's exactly why the bible can be understood by uneducated people amen you could put this book in any country that doesn't have a proper education system and they don't they don't they don't they aren't taught but yet they can read this bible and they understand it it's the way it was written it's not written for the smart and the educated it's written for the simple minded people i think it's just i think it's profound it's written for the most simple minded person if you're filled with the holy spirit you'll understand the wisdom that the bible is trying to convey i believe the entire word of god is exactly that way that's exactly precisely why our brother branham was an uneducated seventh grade education hillbilly from kentucky because it's in line in sync with a bible that's made for simple people you have a message that's made for a simple group that has the ability to not not intellectually understand but believe by revelation what they've heard can you say amen so that's exactly why we say the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life and so we look at this book of james and we're just going to cover just a few minutes of this who is this man james that wrote the book now after study you would find that most uh most all scholars of the bible agree that there were three men named james some say five but really you can limit it down or narrow it down to the the scriptures referring to three different men you have and i got to some of these on the screen here don't have control so you can just advance it this is the one that we read the most about in the gospels this is james the son of zebedee and we'll just cover these just quickly you have james the son of zebedee you also the bible refers to i don't have it on that's why it don't work let me go back good so you have james the son of zebedee and then you have james the son of alphaeus the bible refers to and whether these pictures are real representations um well i'll leave that up to you guys but they were good on google and they look good james also the last james you read about is james the brother of jesus and we're going to say a lot about him this morning and look just into the inner circle or the inner immediate family of jesus because this is where you find james when we read the book of james and also the book of jude brother of jesus it's incredible two of his brothers or you could say half brothers became authors of new testament gospels so james is given three different times you'll find this james the son of zebedee and this is probably the most prominent james that you read about and i'm not going to have them turn so if you had a but if you have a bible you can just turn quickly to matthew chapter 10 and we'll look at just verse 2. as i said we're just going to do an overview not really able to get into a lot of these this is really uh sunday school should be a we only have 30 minutes so it's a good way to entice you to go home and read and study the word uh matthew chapter 10 and we'll just read verse two and i'm gonna read some of these and if we get if you can catch up while i read them good if not we'll just move to the next now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother so here's the two brothers james and john and you'll find this mentioned in matthew mark luke and john and you find that james this man james works with his brother john and with his father zebedee the scripture says that in matthew and references it and also he works with simon peter so here's a trio that you find all the way through the life of jesus you'll see these three men almost an inner circle to jesus it's incredible really when you if you read your bible and especially if you've watched the chosen it's incredible just the 3d look that you get when you really look at the human side of the family or the apostles and their families and you'll find they were just ordinary people nothing special about them uh in society necessarily but jesus found something very special inside of them and so you see this he's with simon peter james john and peter um and they you'll find that they all fished these are the men who fished together had a business uh of fishing and james is mentioned in that group they were all followers of john the baptist as most of the er disciples were followers of john originally and so you see that he he john in matthew chapter 4 verse 18 it says in jesus you can read this if you have it just as matthew 4 verse 18. and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon called peter and andrew his brother casting that into the sea for they were fishers and he said unto them now it's it's amazing because you'll see this reference let me just pull it up here matthew 4 and i'll have it here in just a second it's incredible and let's just look at verse 18 again and jesus walking by the sea saw two brethren simon called peter and his brother and andrew's brother casting into the sea for they were fishers he said to them follow me and i will make you fishers of men and they straight away left their nets and followed him and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them so the bible is going to start referencing james the son of zebedee and then you'll see james the son of alphaeus and then james the brother of jesus and it's just and you'll you'll find in one place and some you may have been confused by this before you'll see john the lesser you've read that in your in your in your bible john the lesser and then the chosen they've called james big james say why is it why are they referring to him as big james because the scripture was using a way to separate there was a difference these were two different men and lesser could mean that he was younger it could have been that he was shorter maybe not as tall as big james i'm not really sure i don't think it really matters but so you see here that jesus it's incredible these three men james john and peter because when jesus prays all night in luke chapter 15 we'll just read it quickly luke chapter 15 verse 12 when he prays in verse 12 and the younger of them said to his father i have i have the wrong reference here forgive me yeah and the younger them said to his father this is correct and and and so he this is when jesus is going to go and pray all night so he chooses 12 disciples and and and james is the third man mentioned after peter and his brother andrew immediately before john and he calls them james and john and you'll see this reference in mark chapter three let's just pick that up quickly mark chapter 3 i do want to read this one forgive me i got a lot of references here and i want to make sure i don't read ones that will take time uh too much time mark chapter 3. look at this here in verse 17. let's just begin reading at verse 15 and to have power to heal sickness and to cast out devils and simon he surnamed peter and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james and he surnamed them now how you pronounce this i don't know uh bowen air just i don't know how you say it correctly but this is a name that he gave james and john looking look further which is the sons of thunder so this is a nickname that jesus gives these two men james and john the sons of thunder and you say why would he call them james and john the sons of thunder well it becomes really obvious to me in luke chapter 9 when they're passing a group of samaritans and the samaritans don't want to accept jesus and james and john look at him and say master should we call down fire from heaven right now and destroy the whole city there's a lot of preachers that way too should we just rain down fire and brimstone and just destroy the entire thing so that's jesus gives them they have this they have a fiery temper just quick to the draw quick to the temper but you know what's amazing is that you'd say but that's a character flaw well jesus doesn't separate them he doesn't say i'm just going to replace you he actually brings that character flaw within his circle these were men in his inner circle and says you're the sons of thunder and god made you that way specifically for a reason and i can use that quality refined by the master i can use it so he calls the he calls them this is the same james james the son of zebedee and so he he brings peter james and john when he goes to mount transfiguration in matthew 7 17 he doesn't call all the disciples he just calls these three men james john and peter you also find that in in mark 9 and luke chapter 9 they were the only three present when jesus raises jarius's daughter amen the only three isn't that incredible he he puts everybody else out and he brings in three something unique or special about these three men um in the garden of gethsemane and you you know that story very well where jesus goes and then he prays and they're falling asleep and he says can you not pray with me just a little while and then he goes the bible says and he goes further into gethsemane and he calls as he goes deeper in gethsemane it ends up that it's only james john and peter who are with him and and so we're we don't have time real i've got so many notes here and i just won't have time to cover them all and so it's a it's incredible when you look at this man james the son of zebedee his life is a very short one after jesus ascends in acts chapter 12 the the bible tells us that herod stretched forth his hand and killed james he was actually the first i believe the first apostle the first disciple to be martyred and his life is very short means he was the first one he was the first one back with the lord so then you you move on from this james to james the son of alphaeus and i want you to look at matthew chapter 10 matthew chapter 10 quickly we look there we're going to look just again quickly uh matthew not mark matthew chapter 10 make sure i got my scripture right yeah now these names of the twelve tribal apostles are these the first simon this is verse two it's called peter anders brother james the son of zebedee john his brother philip verse 3 philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican now here's another james james the son of alphaeus so as the scripture references a different james here james the son of alpheus and and we know his father that that speaking of his father his father's name was alpheus and apparently his mother's name was mary we find that in mark chapter 16 and it says and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary so you have two mary's the brother of james and salmon had brought sweet spices that may come in and so here's this other man james the son of alphaeus whose mother is mary and he's called james the less let's look at that in mark chapter 15 verse 40. mark chapter 15 and we'll look at verse 40. make sure i have that right i do it's just script good scriptural references for you verse 40. there were also women looking on a far off among whom was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the less so there it is the mother of james the less and so here his here's again is his reference differentiating him uh from james or big james or james the greater james the son of zebedee and so james the son of alphaeus is almost unknown his name is mentioned as an apostle but the the gospels there's not any really description of his character or what type of man he was or how he was called just that he was called it's not a lot recorded in the scripture he's mentioned as being in the upper room uh when the holy ghost falls in the their space the cloven tongues cover them and they speak in an unknown language james the son of alphaeus is mentioned there when they're waiting for the promise of the father in acts chapter one you'll find that and then after pentecost he just there's nothing else really recorded of james and some of some of uh some have have identified him as as james this and him and the brother of jesus were the same well that's impossible because actually the bible says jesus's brothers didn't believe in jesus when he was in his earthly when he was in his ministry until after the crucifixion none of his brothers believed in him or his sisters the bible records that and we're going to read that here in a minute they didn't they didn't accept him at all so it couldn't be the same james because this james is called prior to the crucifixion and it's incredible when i thought about this because not all the apostles who were called made had had something written necessarily about their life but some did and others didn't but here's what was important they were called and that was enough to get their name written in the bible and you may never do anything in this life or this world that makes some no some you know some paper or some facebook post or some youtube video you ought to google your name sometime you'd be shocked at what's on there but if you're called and you're chosen that's enough can you say amen several of the apostles aren't mentioned after acts chapter one then you have the final one james the brother of jesus and this james wasn't one of the 12 but he was the brother to jesus in the flesh so he's had the same james's or this james mother was mary and so we know mary wasn't a virgin after jesus right so we we believe in mary we believe she's blessed the bible says and i'll call her blessed mary because the bible says you'll be called blessed for all generations but we won't exalt her and put her in a pedestal or position right it's incredible when the if you look at catholicism and the way that they've exalted mary and put her on it put her at such a place that the bible doesn't but i think it's important sometimes because we have a we have a tendency as humans to be a seesaw right if we see something off so far in this direction we go the complete opposite way oh mary's nothing well actually no mary was a very special woman lived a very unique special life remarkable to be the mother of jesus and james isn't one of the 12 he's one of the four brothers of jesus mentioned uh in matthew chapter 13. quickly we're running out of time so matthew chapter 13. let's just look at that as we can matthew chapter 13 verse 54 all the way down to the very end there we can just begin reading and when he was coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue in so much that they were staunch and said whence hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works is not this the carpenter's son is not his mother called mary and his brethren james there he is and joseph and simon and judas and his sisters are they not all with us whence then has this man all these things and they were offended to him but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor saving his own country in his and his and in his own house and he did not many mighty works because of their unbelief that's and that's just that's a that's a sermon in and of itself right there a prophet is not without honor in other words a prophet has honor except in his own country and it's incredible because because they did not believe in jesus the bible says he couldn't do many mighty works there do you realize how much your belief limits the lord jesus from doing something in your life when you can't see god behind skin in ministry and parents and mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers the lord can't do much because you've got to believe first can you say amen and so he's he's i just want to have five minutes and i'm not the song leader so i don't want to get in trouble with brother tony so let me just wrap this up quickly so it's amazing when you look at the family the human family of jesus we know from the bible that he has four brothers and i don't think the scripture ever gives us a number numerically of his sisters but we know he had a number of sisters and it's amazing how the history and you could read it in the bible tells us that his immediate family his m his mother even mary joseph not really sure some believe he was he passed away shortly after because he's not really mentioned and maybe he was just a quiet quiet person but he doesn't speak much the bible doesn't record much but we know it's incredible because his family doesn't really know what to make of him his immediate family now not his not his not his cut not even his cousins not the rest of of the village not the rest of uh of his of his country but his immediate family don't really know what to make of him in his ministry and it's incredible when you've been with someone for 30 years and then they start saying that they're the messiah it can cause trouble i'd imagine and and and it must have been you can just enter into the human side can you enter in this morning to the human side of this family and their struggle to go i don't know about this and in fact it's incredible the whole entire family at one point in the bible the whole entire family his immediate family thought he had gone crazy thought he'd gone mad and and and the bible actually records they think he's schizophrenic and it doesn't use that word but mary says that he's beside himself you ever realize when you say that man you're beside yourself you're calling someone schizophrenic you're beside yourself and so they they actually thought he was crazy that he had lost his mind and they didn't they they said he's we they think he's beside himself for like living two lives he's a carpenter who thinks he's god he's he's a man he's just a boy he's a man who was who thinks that he's messiah and any and he's he has a split mind in fact it says his family at one point as he's ministering to the multitudes the bible says his family his mother and father come to take him away and to take him home and lock him away you remember that story they come to take him to lock him away because they thought he was beside himself and when they got there there was multitudes of people and they couldn't even get to him to take jesus and so they send a message give this message to and jesus reads the message and you know what jesus says who is my mother says your mother and your father come to your mother and your brothers and your sisters come to take you and jesus says who is my mother who is my father who is my brother he that doeth the will of my father in heaven that is my mother that is my brother that is my sister i can't imagine just looking at this it had to have been painful or hurtful to marry because as you read through the gospels you see progressively after jesus enters his earthly ministry he he disassociates with mary and and almost not i don't want to use a strong word like disown but he disassoci he doesn't call her mother anymore but he calls her woman remember remember that he says woman what have i to do with thee so there's been a there's been a change there's been a uh something take place that there's been a shift and even at the wedding in canaan that's what he says to mary woman what have i to do with thee and it's not until the cross that the humanity because he was 100 human right and he's 100 percent god brother branham said don't let nobody ever tell you he wasn't he was 100 man he was 100 god he was the god man and on the cross as he's dying he has compassion on mary's mother and he looks to john his closest disciple and he looks to mary and he says mary behold your son and he looks to john and says john behold your mother and so he puts mary in the care of john who he loved because he loved his mother i think this is just incredible to me when you look a little further than the doctrinal side of things and you look at the real life and that's what really james is about you still awake this morning you find mary at pentecost and then she's mentioned no more she spoke in tongues in the upper room she played her role she played an important vital role and as the bible says you'll be called blessed blessed uh by all generations we'll call you blessed and so it's incredible because even his brothers jesus's brothers tease him and you'll find that in the bible where they're teasing him oh it's the feast of uh of uh i forget which feast it was there but they they teased them and said go and go and make yourself known as messiah and these brothers are actually teasing jesus even after he begins his public ministries feast of tabernacles and they say go up and make yourself proclaim yourself as messiah because the jews knew that the messiah would be revealed at the feast of tabernacles and so but out of all of these brothers two of them two of those men who picked on him become writers of new testament books i believe i could be wrong but i believe jesus james the brother of jesus was who wrote the book of james that's debated and i don't really think it matters because what's important is that you understand that god was the author of all the books of this bible though he might have used men and it's incredible because jude and james and and it said it said that when jesus died on the cross his brother james was so deeply regretful for how he had treated his but how he treated the lord in his life that he said he'll never eat again and he and he said i'm going to begin to fast from the
