Want to [clears throat] make a couple of just announcements before we uh proceed. [clears throat] Want to say how happy I am to be back in the saddle again. Wow. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. [applause] I think I can still remember how to do this. It's been uh since the week the Sunday prior to camp starting was the last time I stood here and then uh we didn't have Wednesday prior to camp and so as I said we had plenty of services they just weren't here but uh we had a wonderful time uh at camp and I think it was a wonderful success. Appreciate all the help. Amen. And um I've I've got kind of a a thing that I'd like to uh ask the young people to do. and that is to get me some testimonies. And maybe this Wednesday, the Lord willing, if the rapture comes, this will all change. But maybe this Wednesday, uh, if I can, uh, have the service again, then [clears throat] I'd like to maybe share some of those. And I've had some young people express to me that they want to write something down. Amen. And giving thanks to the Lord. And any of them that wish to uh, Amen. stand up and, you know, at the front and give their testimony, that would just be amazing. Amen. So, you be thinking about that, senior youth, and we'll get with you uh through the week. Amen. Thank you for all your prayers for [clears throat] me physically. Um you know, you shake 500 hands at a camp, you never know um what you um well, it's just the devil lurking, but he he ain't nobody still. He ain't nobody. He ain't never been nobody. The family of God, we're not subject to him. He don't get to decide anything about my life. If you need to believe that he makes no decisions regarding, now the Bible says with his own, he can do with him whatever he wants. Um, that's what the scripture says. Uh, whatever he wills, that's what he'll do. I can't imagine people would stay in his camp. Amen. Instead of fleeing to the camp of King Jesus. Amen. But, uh, when it comes to the family of God, he has no say. God uses him. Amen. U puts us through training. Amen. We're all in training. Amen. But uh Peter said, you know, that uh you know, these kind of things would come and you're not to even think it's strange. And you know, John said, you know, and the the you got to let patience have its work. And Paul talks about it. There's a lot that I want to say about that perhaps on Wednesday, the Lord giving me grace. But uh I feel probably 90% recovered. Got a little bit of a lingering cough. So if I have to cough my way through this sermon, that's okay. I'm going to preach it anyway. Amen. [laughter] Praise the Lord. So, um I thank you uh for also for your prayers and much help uh for Sister Debbie and I as we moved from our home of 25 years and we're um busy renovating the house next door as our new home. Amen. I'm going to stop calling it the church house. It's going to be Brother Jason, Sister Debbie's new home. So, we're looking forward to that. Um, apologize for the fellowship hall having to remain closed. I just ask your grace and pardon for that. Can't be avoided. I have um nowhere to really store a lot of the new appliances and lighting and different things like that. And so, um, it's just packed full of stuff and there's even more I've got to put in there. And, um, so, um, we're we're going just as fast as we can. Amen. And um I've I've let uh I've told sister Jen she can she's actually making partial use of it uh kind of a section of it. I'm starting to take it over with all my stuff. But um she's using a partially there uh for all of her many little beauties. Amen. Now Titus, I ain't calling you a beauty, brother. Where you at? Amen. Okay. And her her handsome young men. Praise the Lord. Gabe, good to have you guys here with us today as well. Brother Randy Strand, glad to have you all. Amen. I'm sure I'm forgetting somebody. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Um, yeah, I'm forgetting somebody. Giddy's looking at me strange. Oh, yeah. Okay. Right here. Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh, whoever's a visitor, raise your hand. Praise the Lord. Uh, there's more than that. Come on, raise your hand. Amen. It's okay. I'm gonna just have everybody stare at you. [laughter] Just kidding. We're happy to have Amen. Uh, everybody in the house of God today. Praise the Lord. Um, so we are um, Brother Andrew and Brother Brad are renovating by all possible speed. It's really on me. I'm I'm the one who's kind of 3xed the original um, scope of work. Amen. And so um, they're going as fast as humanly possible. Brother Samuel has called up a small crew from Jacksonville to help out. And uh looks like um I'm going to get Big Al to come help. I got a report from Matt. Uh did he ever confirm, Matt, he's going to come help us and bring a helper? So, Amen. We're going to have to get that rascal back in church. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. I keep I was going to tell brother Matt the other day, when are you going to put on your preacher hat and say, Al, Alex, what are you doing? Why aren't you back in church? And I thought, why don't you do it yourself? So, I'm gonna I'm gonna do it myself, sister Melissa. Praise the Lord. Matt, you can you can do it as well. Amen. Um keep and so um so we're doing that and of course brother Matt is um doing that Matt Watkins thing that he does so well overseeing everything and getting it done and he has to deal with his mother. So y'all keep him in prayer please. Amen. Fasting and prayer for him. Amen. And we'll have the uh fellowship hall opened as rapidly as we can. There's some progress on the next stage of our fellowship hall renovation, but I'll leave that to brother Matt to report on things when they develop just a little bit more. There's some things happening behind the scenes. I want to make an announcement right before I go to to read my scripture that uh in five weeks um which actually would probably be about almost six weeks uh brother Aaron McGary and his lovely family will be with us for some winter meetings. We're going to have that'll be the second weekend of December. Second weekend of December. We're looking forward to that. Amen. I think that's all of my announcements. Everybody good? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's stand back to our feet [clears throat] and um we're going to turn to Isaiah chapter 14 again. We're carrying on this morning by the help of the Lord with our thought on Lucifer's competing claim. So that would make this part three, I believe. I believe two was the last one uh that we covered before camp. And um somehow Okay, that's fine. Just making sure I got all my ducks in a row here. Yeah. Amen. All right. And I want to read verses 1-7. Isaiah 14:1-7. I'm going to take my time and uh and not o try to overdo it and overt tax my system [clears throat] and uh so and that that'll be actually good for the kind of material I want to cover today at any rate from verse one Isaiah 14 and verse 1 through7 I believe I sent you brother Kevin for the Lord will have mercy on Jacob and will yet choose Israel and [snorts] set them in their own land. And the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. And the people shall take them and bring them to their place. The house of Israel of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for servants and handmmaids. And they shall take them captives whose captives they were, and they shall rule over their oppressors. And it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from thy hard bondage, wherein thou was made to serve, that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased? The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked and the scepter of the rulers. He who smoked the people in wrath with a continual stroke. He that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none hinderth. The whole earth is at rest and is quiet. They break forth into singing. Isn't that a beautiful scripture? Amen. Let's pray. [clears throat] Master, we thank you now for your word as we stand here, Lord. And I'm my heart is full of the thoughts that I want to express today. So I pray you'll be with me in body and in mind and give the people all hearing hearts today. Lord, we want to look at these very important things. Lord, it's a terrible hour upon the world and we must see your movements very clearly. We must see them. Lord, we must understand the rhythm. uh Lord of prophecy that is converging with time Lord and bringing events to pass that are unavoidable and unstoppable and irreversible and so Lord we want to know what is our part in the great drama I commit it to you now myself into your hands in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated [clears throat] brother Kevin let's hit Revelation 21 and I want to give a little bit of a refresher and a little bit of a recap from where we've been taking our theme. We had formally been looking at Satan's claim had we read on down um from where we started this series in verse 12. If you remember, we're not don't need to reread it today, but Satan, the Bible says that, you know, he made a claim and he he was uh the son of the morning and and how he was cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations. And you remember the claim that he made in his heart that he would ascend above the stars of heaven. And that is of course the the family of God. He he made a claim that he would exalt his throne above the stars of God. And that's God's family. And he made a claim that he would actually be the one to sit on the throne in the north uh in the mount. Actually, I will sit upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the Nord north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds and I will be like the most high. knows he can't be God, but he he he impersonates God. And this is what brother Brandham, this is this is part of the purpose behind his sermon, the impersonation of Christianity. I don't want to be just an impersonator of Christianity of Christianity. I want to be the real deal. Amen. &gt;&gt; [cough] [clears throat] &gt;&gt; The Bible goes on to say how that he would come to an englorious end and that the people would look narrowly upon him as he descends into the pit. He's going to be according to the uh to the prophecy, he's going to be brought before the king. And there he's going to be cast down and put to death and cast into the lake of fire with the false prophet and uh and and all of these things are after the millennium and after the great white throne judgment. And God is going to make a thorough end of it. and and thus the Lord actually could say that uh the whole earth is at rest and is quiet. They bring forth they break forth into singing. That's going to be an understatement. &gt;&gt; Breaking forth into singing. Friends, I'm going to tell you something, friends. The earth is headed for a peace that that will never be reversed. A peace and a contentment. Can you imagine? And it's hard to imagine, difficult to imagine that you can actually uh not only live out through one day but every day for the rest of your existence, which happens to be for a long time. That you will never feel anxiety again. You'll never have anything threaten you again. You won't have to worry about anything. There won't be any bills to pay. You won't OWE TAXES. YOU WON'T YOU WON'T NEVER GET SICK. YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF A HOME after 25 years. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a It's a city whose builder and maker is God. And And whatever God makes, just think of it backwards, almost like reverse dominoes. Whatever God makes is something he spoke. And everything he spoke is something he thought. And the reason that it got to word and manifestation IS BECAUSE HIS THOUGHTS are immutable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're going to deal with that a little bit. HIS THOUGHTS CAN'T be altered. Immutable means it CAN'T BE ALTERED. THERE'S NO POWER THAT CAN ALTER God's thinking. Therefore, there's no power THAT CAN ALTER HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; People come up with other versions of his word. That doesn't change his word. &gt;&gt; He will JUDGE THE EARTH BY HIS WORD. SEE? AND SO WHOEVER TOOK ANOTHER GOSPEL or a different gospel or whoever lined up with their almost 40,000 different denominations and independent movements and wave their sign that they were his people. They put his NAME ON THEIR BUILDINGS. BUT HE NEVER PROMISED TO MEET THEM where they put his name. He said, "I'LL MEET YOU WHERE I PUT MY NAME." AND HE PUT HIS NAME IN JESUS. AND Jesus is his word. So the only PLACE THE ONLY PLACE FOR DIVINE FELLOWSHIP is faith in his word. THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THE BLOOD IS APPLIED IS FAITH IN HIS WORD. CUZ NONE OF YOU HAVE THE CHEMISTRY of his blood. NOBODY. NOBODY HAS A VIAL OF THAT. The Vatican doesn't. I'll promise you. That's not in Jerusalem anywhere. THERE'S NO SECRET CHAMBER THAT HAS THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. YOU HAVE NO ACCESS to it. That physical blood ran down the cross, claimed the earth. But brother Brandham SAID, "IT'S NOT THE CHEMISTRY of the blood. It's the life in the blood." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the life IS IN THE WORD. SO WHEN YOU BELIEVE THE WORD, YOU GET THE LIFE WHICH IS THE BLOOD WHICH IS ETERNAL. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SEE, and so this this is why once you THIS I IF THAT IF THAT WASN'T TRUE, then Jesus could not make the irreversible claim that ONCE YOU HAVE PASS FROM DEATH TO LIFE, YOU CAN NEVER COME INTO THE JUDGMENT. &gt;&gt; HE COULDN'T MAKE THAT CLAIM IF HIS WORD WAS IMMUTABLE. IF YOU COULD BE BORN AGAIN AND BECOME A NEW CREATION AND THEN STUMBLE AND MAKE A MISTAKE AND LOSE THAT, THEN HIS WORD IS IMMUTABLE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, he's bringing me, HE'S BRINGING YOU. I KNOW WE DON'T ALWAYS FEEL LIKE IT, BUT HE'S BRINGING EVERY ONE OF US IMMUTABLY, UNCHANGEABLY, IRREVERSIBLY TO THE PERFECTION OF THIS WORD. The devil DON'T LIKE IT. SOMETIMES WE DON'T MAKE THE GRADE. IT DOESN'T MATTER. NOTHING STOPS THIS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY YOU BELIEVE IT. THIS IS WHY YOU CAN'T NOT BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; THIS IS EXACTLY WHY THE WORLD CAN'T receive it. &gt;&gt; See, SO SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT in in that regard, we begin to see a pattern. And so Lucifer had made his claim. Jesus makes his claim in Revelation 21. I SAW VERSE ONE, I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH. For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away. There was no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I HEARD A GREAT VOICE OUT OF HEAVEN SAYING, "BEHOLD, the tabernacle of God IS WITH MEN." NOW, THAT'S ALREADY UH WE'VE ALREADY GOT A A COMPETITION &gt;&gt; BECAUSE NOW GOD, THE BIBLE IS SAYING THE TABERNACLE OF GOD IS WITH MEN AND HE WILL DWELL THEM. DWELL WITH THEM. SEE, THE TABERNACLE OF GOD IS WITH MEN AND HE WILL DWELL WITH THEM AND THEY SHALL BE HIS HIS PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; SEE, BUT SATAN HAS CLAIMED, "NO, THEY'RE GOING TO BE MY PEOPLE." JESUS HAS CLAIMED A KINGDOM AND SATAN HAS SAID, "NO, I'M GOING TO HAVE THAT KINGDOM." &gt;&gt; JESUS HAS A PEOPLE. SATAN IS SAYING, "NO, I'M GOING TO HAVE YOUR PEOPLE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE MINE." I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. The the it was not a it was not a a secret. It was publicly stated that as we approached the new millennium uh at the end of 1999 THAT THE VATICAN MADE A CLAIM that the Catholic Church was leading the world, they honestly believe they are leading the world into the millennium. Right. &gt;&gt; AND IF WE'VE HAD THE MILLENNIUM SINCE 2000, I WANT MY MONEY BACK. &gt;&gt; I would like a refund immediately, please. BECAUSE IT'S A SAD DISAPPOINTMENT FROM WHAT I READ THE MILLENNIUM supposed to be. &gt;&gt; And if AND IF AND IF THAT'S SATAN'S VERSION OF A MILLENNIUM NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'LL BE IF HE'S ABLE TO DEFEAT GOD? I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; AND I'M I'm grateful that it's impossible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here is HERE IS VERSE FOUR. GOD SHALL WIPE AWAY ALL TEARS FROM THEIR EYES. AND THERE SHALL BE NO MORE DEATH, NOR SORROW, NOR CRYING, NOR ANY MORE PAIN. EVERY ONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE THE ESSENCE OF WHAT LUCIFER IS. &gt;&gt; SO, WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT A POLAR OPPOSITE CLAIM. YOU CAN'T GET MORE POLAR opposite &gt;&gt; than the claim of Lucifer versus the claim of Jesus. &gt;&gt; We found [clears throat] LAST HE SAID IN VERSE FIVE AND HE SAID, "HE THAT SAT UPON THE THRONE SAID, "BEHOLD, I MAKE ALL THINGS NEW." And he said unto me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful." THIS IS THE ONE SITTING ON THE THRONE. THIS IS HIS FINAL TESTAMENT. THIS IS VERY MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE CLAIM LUCIFER MADE WHEN HE SITS on the throne. &gt;&gt; WE FOUND OUT IN IN PREVIOUS lessons that you know the where we found out the the the difference and and IT'S NOT REALLY SO MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE JUST A SLIGHT NUANCE in the use of the word bride versus wife. We found that you know the uh spirit and the bride say come in revelation 22 WE FOUND HIS WIFE HATH MADE HERSELF READY IN REVELATION 19 and THEN IN REVELATION 21 WE FIND THAT I WILL SHOW THEE THE BRIDE THE LAMB'S WIFE SO IT USES both terms in the same verse AND SO WE FOUND THAT ONE IS JUST SIMPLY DEALING WITH THE ESPOUSAL time when he would come at the end time to marry a bride be invisible visibly united WITH HER AND TAKE HER TO A WEDDING SUPPER. WE ESTABLISHED THAT CLEARLY THAT WE DON'T GO TO A WEDDING. We're married here. Brother Brandham made it clear. WE'RE MARRIED HERE AND WE GO TO THE WEDDING SUPPER. So now in this last day, he was able to come BECAUSE HE SENT A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION THAT WOULD CALL A BRIDE OUT AND HER PERFECTION BY BELIEVING THE WORD HE SENT RAISES THE DEAD FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. And we meet the Lord in the air. AND SO SO WE WE FIND that he had he HAD HAD TO SIT DOWN in the eternities there after the church fell away. THE WORD GOT SEALED UP UNDER SEVEN SEALS AND JESUS SAT DOWN in the eternities to intercede for the ignorance of of his people. not able uh in in order to save them, he would withhold all the word from them BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BECAUSE SIN IS UNBELIEF AND THAT'S WHAT'LL GET YOU KILLED. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AND THAT'LL GET YOU DOOMED IS TO DISBELIEVE THE WORD. [snorts] &gt;&gt; SO HE WITHHELD THE WORD BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DISBELIEVE WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW. &gt;&gt; You see? SO HE'S INTERCEDING FOR THEIR IGNORANCE. BUT JUST NOW HE THAT'S NOT NOVEL OR NEW. HE HAD done that for Israel. Paul made Paul, THAT WAS PAUL'S MESSAGE THERE IN THE BOOK OF ACTS TO HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. THERE WAS A TIME HE SAID THAT YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU BROUGHT YOUR BLOOD OF BULLS and goats and YOU GAVE THESE SACRIFICES AND GOD WKED AT YOUR IGNORANCE. But now he's not willing to do that anymore BECAUSE OF THAT DAY ON CALVARY. BECAUSE HE AROSE AND ASCENDED AND SENT BACK HIS LIFE. AND PETER HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE NEW BIRTH. YOU HAVE TO REPENT AND BELIEVE. SEE? AND NOW, SO PAUL SAID, "SO YOU'RE 1600 YEARS." THEY DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE TODAY THAT AFTER 2,000 YEARS WE NEEDED A PROPHET. BUT AFTER 1600 YEARS, PAUL SAID, "ALL OF YOUR LAW OF MOSES IS NOW WORTHLESS. IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU GOD WILL NOT HONOR THAT SYSTEM ANY LONGER. IT WAS A TEMPORARY SITUATION. AND HE HAS STEPPED OUT OF THE ETERNITIES. HE HAS CLAIMED THE BOOK. HE HAS LOOSED THE SEALS. AND HE REQUIRES ALL MEN WHO WANT TO BE REDEEMED TO COME TO THE OPENING OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; These things are not new to US. THIS IS ELEMENTARY TEACHING. &gt;&gt; SO, SO [clears throat] WE FIND THEN that that when it when he comes TO THIS POINT IN REVELATION 22 AND THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE SAY, "COME." NOW I I'M REALLY STARTING TO TURN INTO FRESH MATERIAL. So really keep your keen attention. AND YOU YOU ALREADY ARE. THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT. [clears throat] The spirit and the bride say come. Now, I I WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BRING YOU TO THE FACT THAT IN FACT, AS WE COVERED IT in a previous installment, THAT GOD HIMSELF, AS WE read in REVELATION 19, SHALL DWELL with them. THERE'S NOWHERE, THAT'S THE FIRST TIME IN THE WHOLE BIBLE IT EVER SAYS THAT God himself shall dwell with them. And brother BRHAM MAKES THAT VERY CLEAR BECAUSE NOTICE THAT WHEN HE COMES IN THE rapture that his feet don't touch the earth. We meet Jesus in the air. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it's true that Jesus is in the MILLENNIUM BECAUSE HE'S IN A GLORIFIED BODY. WE'RE IN GLORIFIED BODIES. UH THE 144,000 ARE IN GLORIFIED BODIES. I I I'm PRETTY SURE THOSE UNDER THE FIFTH SEAL ARE IN GLORIFIED BODIES. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE REST OF THE NATIONS THAT ARE RAISED UP DURING A thousand years. &gt;&gt; I don't know. It's brother Brennham didn't did didn't to make it clear. PERHAPS HE LOOKED AT IT. THEY ASKED HIM QUESTIONS. Will we have children? Will we not? HE SAYS, "WELL, IN PLACES IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL. IN PLACES IT LOOKS like we won't." He said, "I don't know. If he ever tells me, I'll tell you." Because the millennium IS A HONEYMOON. THERE'S CERTAIN PARTS THAT ARE KEPT SECRET. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL IT'LL BE, BUT I KNOW I WANT TO BE THERE. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; That's the one I want RULING THE EARTH, NOT THIS OTHER GUY WHO made his big claims in Isaiah 14. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, SO WE WE FIND THEN THAT THAT THIS THAT THAT I WANT YOU TO consider this FOR A FOR A MOMENT NOW BECAUSE as we've been showing you to me when I look at it THAT GOD HIMSELF BECAUSE REMEMBER even in the millennium THE EARTH IT DOESN'T SAY GOD HIMSELF. JESUS IS THERE WITH US AND THEY'RE THE SAME PERSON. YOU UNDERSTAND? BUT JUST WATCH JUST LIKE THE BRIDE AND THE WIFE ARE THE SAME PERSON BUT IT'S JUST DIFFERENT ALLOCATIONS WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THAT AT THAT MOMENT BECAUSE WHILE WHILE WE are in GLORIFIED BODIES THE WORD IS ALREADY IN ITS EIGHTH DAY. &gt;&gt; The opening OF THE SEALS BROUGHT THE WORD BACK TO ITS ETERNAL DAY. MY SOUL IS ALREADY IN ITS ETERNAL DAY. &gt;&gt; SEE MY BODY IS NOT YET BUT IT WILL BE. BUT EVEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS IN THE MILLENNIUM, THE EARTH WILL STILL BE IN ITS SEVENTH DAY. &gt;&gt; NOW, THE CURSE IS TAKEN OFF THE EARTH AND IT'S WRITED 23° UP ON ITS CORRECT AXIS. SO, WE GET THE THE POLAR CAPS BACK. &gt;&gt; THEY ALREADY KNOW THERE'S VEGETATION UNDER THAT ICE. IT DIDN'T USED to be ice. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; That's an understatement. So, so we know THAT THAT BUT BUT YET THE EARTH HAS TO LIVE OUT ITS SEVENTH DAY. AND THAT'S WHY IN AFTER THE MILLENNIUM AND AFTER THE JUDGMENT AND AFTER SATAN HAS BEEN ANNIHILATED AND DEATH AND HELL ARE CAST INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE AND ALL EVIL IS DONE AWAY WITH AND THE EARTH IS FINALLY FOREVER AT PEACE AND IN QUIET, THEN GOD HIMSELF SHALL DWELL. AND EVERY TIME WHEN WE THINK ABOUT GOD'S PRESENCE, WE REALIZE THAT THAT THAT GREAT ETERNAL SPIRIT MANIFEST HIMSELF IN HIS WORD. THAT GREAT ETERNAL SPIRIT MANIFEST HIMSELF IN PROPHETS &gt;&gt; AND THEY CALLED THEM GODS. &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAYS MOSES WAS A GOD TO THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AND SO THEN HE MANIFEST HIMSELF FULLY IN CHRIST. NOW HE'S MANIFESTING HIMSELF FULLY IN THE BRIDE. IT'S THE SAME GOD ALL THE TIME. ONLY NOW HE'S NOT TRAPPED WALKING THE SHORES OF GALILEE BECAUSE HE GAVE HIM THE COMMISSION GO INTO ALL THE WORLD. HOW WAS THAT EVER GOING TO HAPPEN? EVEN IF THEY WENT INTO ALL THE WORLD, WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO THEM UNLESS HE GOD CAME AND LIVED INSIDE THEM? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN I LOOK AT GOD HIMSELF DWELLING, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A SECOND BEING OTHER THAN JESUS. I'M LOOKING AT HIS WHOLE FAMILY AND ALL THE EARTH AND ALL CREATION AND THE WHOLE ROLE OF THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE IS NOW FILLED. AND GOD [screaming] HIMSELF WHO FILLS ALL TIME, SPACE, AND ETERNITY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WILL BE LIVING AND ABIDING WITH IN AND through &gt;&gt; and I'm going to sit down with Jesus for thousands of years. &gt;&gt; And just talk. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, so I WANT TO WHEN WE SO WHEN WE COME TO AND THAT'S THE THAT'S REALLY why Satan's vision wouldn't do him any good even IF HE COULD PULL IT OFF BECAUSE HE CANNOT INDWELL GOD'S FAMILY. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? HE CAN POSSESS THE FALSE PROPHET, BUT HE CAN'T DIVIDE HIMSELF INTO HIS CHURCH LIKE THAT. HE'S GOT DEMONS. BUT I'M GLAD GOD DIDN'T JUST SEND ANGELS TO GIVE ME A NEW BIRTH. GOD HIMSELF CAME INSIDE ME. AND AND THE LIFE I LIVE, I NOW LIVE BY THE FAITH OF, NOT IN, BUT OF THE SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; So [clears throat] you're you're good. &gt;&gt; I don't want to lose you. THIS IS JUST IT'S PROFOUND AND IT'S REALLY OCCUPIED MY MIND FOR WEEKS. So when we and I have much more to say that I'm not going to get into today, THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE SAY COME. [clears throat] SO NOW HAVING SAID WHAT I'VE SAID, it's all about God manifesting, calling all those names and living in them and resurrecting them and getting through the millennium and being there in the new heavens and the new earth. And from there, remember I I ended I THINK PART ONE WITH BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE BECAUSE THEN THERE'S THE HIDDEN MANA AND WE DON'T EVEN THAT'S A THAT THAT'LL BLOW FUSES CUZ WE DON'T WE GOT ALMOST NO INFO ALMOST NO INTEL ON THAT. WE GOT MORE ON THE MILLENNIUM THAN WE GOT ON THAT. ALL WE KNOW IS BROTHER BRANDHAM JUST SAID IT IS ALL HE SAID. HE SAID SOMETIMES the hidden mana the future application of the hidden mana he said sometimes where you know we hear the word of God and we THINK IT IS SO GOOD AND YOU THINK IT IS SO GOOD AND YOU'RE REJOICING WITH ME TODAY HE SAID someday he and that word will become what you never dreamed possible &gt;&gt; what does that even mean I don't know &gt;&gt; but I want to be there &gt;&gt; see because whatever it is it's the word &gt;&gt; becoming more. I'M GOING TO BECOME WHAT I never dreamed possible. YOU'RE GOING TO BECOME WHAT YOU NEVER DREAMED POSSIBLE. WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, I BELIEVE IT WILL BE THE ETERNAL UNFOLDING OF THE MYSTERY OF THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST IN THE CEASELESS AGES TO COME. I just want to roll around on the ground right now. I FEEL LIKE I COULD JUST LAY DOWN AND JUST ROLL AROUND. If I had snow, I'd make SNOW ANGELS. I I I FEEL LIKE RUNNING. I FEEL LIKE ROLLING. I GET TO THINKING OF IT LIKE THAT, I I DON'T WANT TO GET OUT AND RUN UP THE ROAD. I'D PROBABLY OUTRUN TRAFFIC. I ain't going to try it, but So, SO NOW WHILE NOW THAT I'VE GOT YOUR MIND IN THAT VEIN, I want you to think about this verse with me. And the spirit and the bride. KEV, LET'S GO AHEAD AND PUT THAT UP. 22:17 Revelation 22:17 [sighs] and the spirit and the bride say come. So now we're understanding THAT THE MOST SUPERIOR FORM OF the word is when it's in flesh. &gt;&gt; When it's speaking through a lived life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand that this is exactly why Peter You say more so than than the Bible. Okay, calm down. Hold on. This is just ink on paper &gt;&gt; that a publisher put together. Now, the the magic part of it is is that the words are the thoughts of God. So, they're divine. &gt;&gt; And you'll get a blessing reading it. Even though a publisher published it, YOU'LL GET A BLESSING AND JUST HEARING somebody read it. AND BROTHER BRANDON PUT HIS DOWN ON A CHAIR AND WALKED AROUND AND SAID, "LORD, THERE'S LIFE IN THERE FOR WHOEVER." SO, SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT SUBTRACTING ANYTHING FROM YOUR BIBLES. BUT, BUT REMEMBER THAT WHEN PETER COMPARED THE OLD TESTAMENT BIBLE TO JESUS, HE SAID TO THE CHURCH, "WE HAVE A MORE SURE WORD OF PROPHECY THAN THAT BIBLE BECAUSE IT ONLY TOLD ABOUT THE MESSIAH COMING. I SAW HIM. I ATE WITH HIM. I FISHED WITH HIM. I HAVE A MORE SURE WORD. I HAVE A SUPERIOR VERSION OF THE WORD THAN THE WHAT THE word was when it was written in scrolls. So that should be easy. Nobody should impugn me for that. See, SO SO JESUS NEVER CARRIED A BIBLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Cuz he was the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; I don't want you TO DARE THINK I'M MINIMIZING YOUR BIBLE. This is the This is your This is your UM YOUR YOUR BIBLE BASIC INFO BEFORE LEAVING EARTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Uh Brother Earl used to tell me that way back up in back in the day. I've heard that. I almost couldn't remember how it went. SO, SO WE REALIZED THEN THAT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD MADE A STATEMENT WHEN THE BOOKS ARE CLOSED FOR THE LAST time the word will be flesh. Now, IF THAT'S NOT SUPERIOR, WHY WOULD YOU close them FOR THE LAST TIME? WHY WOULD YOU NOT JUST KEEP IT OPEN FOREVER AND just let everybody go around reading it for ceaseless ages? HE'S BECOMING SOMETHING. YOU'RE NOT MEMORIZING VERSES. YOU'RE BECOMING VERSES. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL'S NOT AFRAID OF HOW MANY VERSES YOU CAN QUOTE. HE'S AFRAID OF HOW MANY VERSES live &gt;&gt; inside you. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO THE MOST SUPERIOR FORM OF THE WORD IS WHEN IT'S MANIFESTED IN FLESH LIKE JESUS. See this is what the Holy Ghost is given for. This is why IT CAME. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE A MESSAGE AND A MESSENGER TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. IT WASN'T POSSIBLE. THE CHURCH COULDN'T GO IN THE RAPTURE IN THE CONDITION IT WAS IN. AND AS IF THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH, IT COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER. IT TOOK IT TOOK GOD SENDING A PROPHET. AND PEOPLE SAY, "WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? WHY did he always do that?" &gt;&gt; THE ANSWER IS NOT DIFFERENT. WHY DID HE ALWAYS DO THAT? SEE, BECAUSE THAT'S HOW GOD speaks to human peop to humans through prophets. AND SO, SO THEN NOW WATCH AS IT GOES ON. The spirit AND THE BRIDE SAY, "COME." And let HIM THAT HEARETH SAY COME. and let HIM THAT IS A THIRST COME AND WHOSOEVER WILL LET HIM TAKE OF THE WATER OF LIFE FREELY. So the spirit IN AND THROUGH THE BRIDE are saying something &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT words proceeding merely from their lips. What the world is hearing IS THE VOICE OF A LIVED LIFE. And the LIVE LIFE LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD INVITE PEOPLE TO LOVE GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT A CHRISTIAN IS. SEE, WHATEVER THIS LIFE IS, IT IS SUCCESSFULLY INVITING THE WORLD WHO ARE THIRSTY, WHO WANT LIFE, WHOEVER WANT TO TAKE THE WATER OF LIFE FREELY. YOUR LIFE MAKES [screaming] THEM BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE. [cheering] AMEN. &gt;&gt; APOLOGETICS WON'T DO THAT. APOLOGETICS APOLOGISTS ARGUE WITH ANOTHER APOLOGIST. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, I MEAN, IF IF THAT'S IT, THEN I CAN GET TWO LEARNED APOLOGIST AND I'LL AND THEY'LL DISAGREE. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THEY WERE DISAGREEING ON A PUNCTUATION 2,000 YEARS AGO. IF APOLOGIST CAN DO IT, THEN WHY DO WE GO FROM ONE TRUE GOSPEL TO 40,000? &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE INSANE TO KEEP BELIEVING THAT APOLOGETICS CAN FIX IT. &gt;&gt; I'M GLAD FOR APOLOGETICS. I'M GLAD FOR ETMOLOGY. I'M GLAD FOR ALL OF THESE DISCIPLINES. THEY HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND THE WORD. AND SO I I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE ETMOLOGY OF THE WORD ESSENCE, GOD'S ESSENCE. AND AND ARISTOTLE SAID THAT THAT ESSENCE IS ESSENCE MEANS WHAT IT IS. I thought, okay, that sounds a little modern, but that's WHAT HE SAID ESSENCE WAS. IT'S THE HE SAID, IT'S THE THIS. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS HIS WORDS. IT'S WHAT IT IS. WHAT'S ESSENCE? IT'S WHAT IT IS. IT'S the this. [laughter] Oh my goodness. SO, SO IT'S OUR LIVED LIFE. NOW, HERE COMES MY TURN. You holding on? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're living a life that has a voice, &gt;&gt; that is a testimony to the world, that gives them hope that there can be something better than what they have. &gt;&gt; But how would that scripture be relevant to us after we're seated at the marriage supper? You're not going to be here living your life inviting sinners, giving them hope. So, it has no relevance to you. IT HAS NO EFFECTIVE PURPOSE. Once we're raptured, once we're gone, you're you're not going to be in the earth living a life inviting him to come to take the water of life freely. &gt;&gt; SO, IF THAT'S THE CA, DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? Then that being the case, then this HAS TO BE OUR MARK, OUR PRIZE, OUR HIGH CALLING. THIS HAS TO BE WHAT'S ACTIVE IN YOUR LIFE NOW, &gt;&gt; NOT IN THE FUTURE. IT WON'T DO THE WORLD ANY GOOD IN THE FUTURE. ONCE YOU'RE AT A WEDDING TABLE, IT'S ALL OVER. THIS IS YOUR TIME TO HAVE THIS VOICE. THIS IS YOUR TIME TO MAKE A THIRSTY SINNER BELIEVE THERE'S A FOUNTAIN SOMEWHERE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS YOUR TIME TO LET THE LOWER LIGHTS BE BURNING &gt;&gt; TO SEND A GLEAM AL ACROSS THE WAY THAT SOME POOR WAYFAIRING SEMEN YOU MAY rescue you may save. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Nothing. And this is a new line of thinking for me. I've been pondering it. [snorts] Nothing in judgment that pours out ON THE EARTH, NOR IN RESTORATION. God has been judging and pouring out judgment and restoration. judgment, restoration, judgment, restoration down through the centuries. AND I WANT TO SAY THAT NOTHING IN judgment nor in restoration happens suddenly. This is very important. It's very important. I heard a a Jewish scholar talking about how that that first century AD leading up to AD70 when Israel was when Jerusalem was sacked by Titus and the Roman legions. AND HE SAYS THAT DIDN'T JUST SUDDENLY HAPPEN. He said WHEN YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT OUR HISTORY, we were WE WERE SINNING HORRIBLY SINNING ALL THE WAY UP to it. AND HE SAID SIGNS AND THINGS WERE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AND POLITICS and things were THINGS WERE MOVING THAT WERE SETTING THE STAGE FOR THAT JUDGMENT. THE WORLD RIGHT NOW IS BEING SET UP FOR JUDGMENT. THE TRIBULATION DOESN'T IT IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO START PRETTY QUICKLY ONCE THE BRIDE IS GONE. BUT YOU UNDERSTAND FRIENDS THAT THE THAT THE TRIBULATION THAT BREAKS UNDER THE SIXTH SEAL HAS ALREADY PARTIALLY CRACKED OPEN. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID ALL THOSE SEALS PARTIALLY OPEN. WE WE WE SHOWED YOU THAT WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE VIALS WHICH CORRELATE TO THE TRUMPETS AND AND AND AND THAT SIXTH SEAL OF PEOPLE SAY WELL HOW IS THE SIXTH SEAL AHEAD OF THE SEVENTH SEAL IF THE SEVENTH SEAL IS THE COMING OF THE LORD AND THEN THE TRI SIX SEAL IS THE TRIBULATION BECAUSE THE SEVENTH SEAL IS HIDDEN IN THE SIXTH SEAL. THE SIXTH SEAL OPEN WHEN THOSE DEMON CHARGERS WERE ACTUALLY EVEN BEFORE THAT SATAN IS IS CAST DOWN AND HE'S GIVEN THE KEYS TO THE BOTTOMLESS PIT AND HE UN UNLOCKS IT AND THE BIBLE TALKS ABOUT THE THE DEMONS THAT CAME UP OUT OF THERE AND BROTHER BRANDHAM'S WORDING IS DEMON POWERS ARE STREAMING into the earth THE LID'S BEEN TORN FROM HELL &gt;&gt; AND DEMON POWERS ARE STREAMING SO SO THEN THEN THE SO THEN YOU'VE GOT THE THE TRIBULATION IS UNDERWAY AND THAT STARTS WITH A first woe and AND IT WOULD JUST GO SECOND WOE, THIRD WOE, TRIBULATION, ARMAGEDDON DONE. BUT AN ANGEL RISES UP OUT OF THE EAST HAVING THE SEAL OF THE LIVING GOD. IT COULD BE NOBODY BUT CHRIST BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY THE HOLY GHOST CAN GIVE YOU THE SEAL. AND HE RISES FROM THE EAST AND HE HAS STRANGELY HE HAS AUTHORITY TO TO ENFORCE A TEMPORARY INJUNCTION ON GOD'S WORD. WHO CAN DO THAT BUT GOD HIMSELF YOU CAN'T INJUNCT GOD'S WORD. THERE'S NO COURT AHEAD OF HIS THAT CAN GO JUST A SECOND GOD. UH ONLY GOD CAN DO THAT. SO THESE ANGELS ON THE FOUR WINDS HAVE BEEN GIVEN A COMMISSION TO DESTROY THE EARTH. IT'S ALREADY STARTED. BUT HE RISES UP AND SAYS HOLD ON. I STILL GOT SERVANTS. I STILL GOT TO SEND AN ELIJAH PROPHET. I GOT TO TAKE OUT A GENTILE BRIDE SNEAKER AWAY WHILE THE WORLD AIN'T LOOKING AND THEN GO GET MY 144,000 OLD FRIENDS. THIS WHOLE THING, IT'S IT'S NOT HAPPENING SUDDENLY. IT'S HAPPENING IN IN SUCCESSION. AND IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR DECADES AND EVEN CENTURIES. &gt;&gt; THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE END OF THE 19TH CENTURY, MOVING INTO THE 20TH CENTURY. WE'VE EVEN HAD A MESSAGE AND AND NOW WE'RE 50, 60, 70 YEARS MOVING. ISRAEL HAS ALREADY IN 1948 DECLARED themselves a nation. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? AND I HEARD A RABBI SAY IT AND I OF COURSE I HAD to research IT A LOT. HAD TO DO A LOT OF a lot of arduous re. It wasn't that the research was difficult. It was just a lot because LLMs make it easy, but you still have to verify all the sources. and and I and I AND SO I I HEARD HIM SAY AND I WENT AND RESEARCHED IT AND IT'S SOLID AS EVERYTHING THAT ACCORDING TO THE JEWISH CALENDAR, BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT A JEWISH CALENDAR AND THAT ALL TRADITIONAL RABBITIC teaching across the board holds that Abraham WHO STARTED AS ABRAM THAT ABRAHAM WAS born in THE YEAR 1948 AFTER CREATION. called the year of the world. AND THEY ACTUALLY TRACK IT USING A JEWISH CALENDAR THAT AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT STUFF UP. THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS. HOW IS IT THAT ABRAHAM IS BORN IN 1948 AFTER CREATION AND ISRAEL BECOMES A NATION IN 1948? I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. THESE THINGS AREN'T ACCIDENTS. WHO'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. WHO'S IN THE VATICAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. AND WE WAITED 70 YEARS FOR A POPE NOT FROM AMERICA, FROM THE UNITED STATES. AND A MAN BORN IN CHICAGO RISES UP, TAKES A DASCESE IN SOUTH AMERICA. SO HE'S FROM THE UNITED STATES, HE'S A POPE FROM AMERICA. HE'S SEATED ON THE THRONE. SOMETHING THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE VATICAN, AND EVERYBODY SAID COULD NEVER EVER HAPPEN. I I WAS READING SO MANY ARTICLES, PEOPLE SAYING, "COULD IT BE AN AMERICAN?" AND ALL THE EXPERTS WERE SAYING, "IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. NO, THE WORLD DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THAT MUCH POWER TO THE UNITED STATES." BUT THEY COULDN'T STOP IT BECAUSE A PROPHET HAD SAID IT &gt;&gt; AND IT'S IN THE SCRIPTURE. AND TODAY, YOU'RE LIVING [screaming] THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I COULD SAY TO YOU THAT WORD IS NOW MADE FLESH. &gt;&gt; And you couldn't disagree. SO, SO THESE THINGS DON'T SUDDENLY HAPPEN. [sighs] SO, NOW BROTHER BRANDHAM WHEN HE HE GOES INTO SHALOM AND THERE'S NO MESSAGE BETTER IN MY MIND TO DESCRIBE THIS WHOLE idea of you being the voice shout a voice of trumpet. We are that voice of the message. But God doesn't need you and ME TO GO BACK and reshout it. He doesn't need the prophet's messages corrected. &gt;&gt; He just needs to get people to believe it and THEN HE'LL MOVE INSIDE AND START LIVING IT. &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S CHRIST WHO DOES ALL THREE. IT'S NOT ABOUT BIG EYES'S AND LITTLE U'S. IT'S NOT A SUPERCHRISTIAN VERSUS A WEAKER CHRISTIAN. IT'S ABOUT CHRIST DOING ALL THREE. IT WASN'T WILLIAM BRANDHAM'S MESSAGE. IT WAS CHRIST ISSUING THE shout through A PROPHET. IT'S CHRIST SPEAKING THROUGH THE VOICE OF THE BRIDE. IT'S CHRIST WHO IS THE VOICE OF THE RESURRECTION THAT WAKES THE SLEEPING SAINTS. &gt;&gt; SO THIS CONCEPT OF THE WORD BEING FLESH, THE WORD living out AS THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE AS THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE saying something. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "REMEMBER THE COMPOSER KNOWS THE END FROM THE BEGINNING. He knows all about it. That's the reason he could write it here." See, so what's what he's written, HE ALREADY KNOWS IT'S going to come to pass. What's in words that were in his thoughts THAT ARE NOW IN WORDS that are on paper, he, the composer, HAS HANDED IT TO A CONDUCTOR. And the conductor has gathered people who ARE GIFTED TO PLAY THE MUSIC. &gt;&gt; And not the whole WORLD IS, BUT THESE people are. &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE PAY MONEY TO GO HEAR THEM. WHY DON'T EVERYBODY JUST GO DO IT? BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO IT. YOU GOT TO BE EXTREMELY GIFTED to do that. AND SO THEY'RE GIFTED. AND AND SO BROTHER BRENNHAM IS NOW CORRELATING. YOU KNOW, IT IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE THE THE BEST MOST HANDSOME PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, THE SMARTEST, THE SMELL THE BEST. HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. IT'S THAT YOU HAVE A UNIQUE THING CALLED A GENE OF GOD. AND IT IS NOT JUST A UH SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM GOD. IT'S ACTUALLY A PIECE OF GOD INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; SO, WHAT I WHAT CAN I DO WITH A LITTLE PIECE? IT ONLY TAKES ONE SEED TO GROW A WHOLE THING. WELL, HIS WORD MULTIPLIES. &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD. &gt;&gt; SO, HE GOES ON. AND HE SAYS, AND HE SAYS, YOU MUST BEGIN WITH HIM. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A SYMPHONY. IF YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO BE A LIFE SONG, YOU'VE GOT TO GET IN THE RHYTHM OF THE COMPOSER. HE SAID, YOU BEGIN WITH HIM. LIKE IN MUSIC, AT THE AT THE SYMPHONY, YOU LISTEN. YOU KNOW WHAT IT SAYS. IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT THE SYMPHONY IS. I LOVE THAT. IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT THE SYMPHONY IS, not what you want to play. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Message don't need players. &gt;&gt; Amen. The message needs outlets for the Holy Spirit to live through. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT THE SYMPHONY IS. THEN YOU BEGINNING, YOU BEGIN TO LISTEN AT THE MUSIC AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO HEAR IT. SEE, NOW NOW WE'RE BACK TO OUR LIFE SAYING, "LET HIM THAT IS a thirst. Let him come take the waters of life freely." That's your music. You're playing that and people are coming in to what is this strange music? How beautiful. You mean there's actually hope for me? I I had almost GIVEN UP HOPE. I DIDN'T I DIDN'T EVEN THINK THERE WAS A REAL GOD. OH, let me just play you some more music, friends. Just sit back and watch this and see and let it begin to change your whole heart. And brother Brandham says, you begin to listen and you know what it is. YOU KNOW JUST ABOUT HERE WHERE CERTAIN THINGS TAKE PLACE. NOW IT'S GOT TO CHANGE. SEE, THE MUSIC WAS WRITTEN IN ADVANCE BEFORE THEY STARTED PLAYING IT. THEY'RE NOT FIGURING IT OUT. PROPHECY IS NOT GOD FIGURING IT OUT AS HE GOES. THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN REAL TIME. TIME IS MEETING PROPHECY. AND THAT'S WHY SATAN CANNOT STOP IT. &gt;&gt; MY &gt;&gt; SO HE GOES ON. NOW TO ANYBODY THAT DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE THEY JUST WALK IN AND SAT DOWN. IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF NONSENSE, rattling noise. I get it. They they call us a cult. They call us everything. They don't get it. They don't understand. Why can't you just cooperate? Why can't you just be one of the 40,000 different movements? No, thank you. &gt;&gt; He says, HE SAYS, "BUT THE ONE WHO KNOWS WHAT IT IS, &gt;&gt; IT'S BEAT OUT WITH THE MUSIC. IT'S DRUMED OUT WITH THE NOTES." SEE, CHRIS, there is a playing in in the right note. Amen. IT'S TRUMPETED WITH THE TRUMPETS. IT'S STRUNG ON THE HARP. IT'S PLAYED WITH THE VIOLIN. IT'S BEAT ON THE BASS. IT'S SOUNDED BY THE TRUMPETS. IT'S BEAT ON THE DRUMS. THE NOW WATCH THE WHOLE THING. SEE, IT'S THE BODY OF CHRIST FITLY JOINED TOGETHER WITH THE WITH WITH WITH THE ENERGY THAT EVERY JOINT SUPPLIES. GOD HAS SEVERALLY GIFTED THE ORCHESTRA AS HE WILL. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THIS IS WHY YOU COME TO CHURCH PRAYED UP. THIS IS WHY YOU GO TO GOD IN THE MORNING, YOU GO TO HIM AT NIGHT, YOU THINK ABOUT HIM ALL DAY LONG BECAUSE YOU'RE PLAYING THE MUSIC. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER, OUR WHOLE CHURCH TOGETHER IS A IS A IS IN rhythm until and it MAKES THE DRAMA TILL YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR eyes and live in it. Now when you hear that line read, live in it. Don't go from here ever again and say, "Brother Jason, I don't really think it's anything about living in my life. I just think it's I just need to tell people God sent a prophet and tell them what the doctrine and the teaching is and explain the seventh seal. The devil can do that &gt;&gt; better than you can. &gt;&gt; The devil knows who William Brandon was. I will promise you. &gt;&gt; And he can explain the seventh seal better than most of y'all. &gt;&gt; But but he doesn't believe it. See, he knows IT'S TRUE. BROTHER BRANDHAM ACTUALLY SAID IN ONE PLACE HE ACTUALLY BELIEVES, BUT THAT DON'T HE'S NOT CONVERTED. SEE, he says he don't make believe. He actually believes it. See, BUT HE'S NOT CONVERTED. SO HE SAID IT MAKES THE DRAMA TILL YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR EYES AND LIVE in it. MAN, SEE IF YOU DID THAT, IF YOU JUST WOULD do that, THEN IT WOULD NOT YOU WOULD NOT FEEL LIKE YOU GOT TO JUMP THROUGH RINGS OF FIRE TO SAVE YOUR LOST LOVED ONES. &gt;&gt; JUST LIVE IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE DEVIL AND TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS THAT COME UP THAT ARE FOR YOUR PERFECTING ANYWAY THAT GOD IS GOING TO HARNESS FOR YOUR GOOD ANYHOW. AND HE'S GOING TO BRING ALL THE THINGS TOGETHER IF YOU'LL JUST WAIT. HE'LL MAKE THEM ALL WORK FOR YOUR GOOD. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SEE, SO THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IF YOU'RE IN THE SYMPHONY, YOU BEGIN TO GET INTO THE RHYTHM. THAT'S THE WAY YOU DO GOD. YOU DON'T STAND OFF AND LOOK AT IT. YOU GET INTO THE RHYTHM OF IT. HOW DO YOU GET IN THERE? YOU'RE BORN INTO IT. INTO THE RHYTHM OF THE WORD. SEE? SO, SO, SO THIS ISN'T ABOUT JUST SAYING WORDS. HE SAYS, WHEN YOU BECOME part of that word, &gt;&gt; so everything that we learn in the message has to be brought down to the here and now. We're not just GATHERING INFORMATION AND REJOICING OVER IT. WE DO REJOICE OVER IT. BUT BUT BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT IT? &gt;&gt; I'm glad you LOVE THE WORD. I'M GLAD YOU LOVE PREACHING. I'M GLAD YOU REJOICE AND YOU PULL AND YOU SAY SICKLE AND THAT MAKES THE PREACHER GO HARDER. BUT BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT? &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH, HE SAID BROTHER BRANDON SAID OH YOU SAY OH BROTHER BRANDON WE SURE ENJOY THAT." HE SAID, "GREAT. NOW, WILL YOU do it?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; SO, SO SINCE ELECTION THEN SHOWS ME THAT I CAME from the word, THEN I WAS BORN into this world, a part of the word already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the word is eternal. So if I'm a part of the word, then that can only mean I was born here already. The word, you understand? Just waiting for the Holy Spirit to bring it to life. So therefore true Christianity then is rightly so true Christianity based on that then if you agree with that then true Christianity IS POWER AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE WORD YOU CAN'T MAKE IT DIFFERENT THAN THAT WHICH IS TO SAY THAT MY LIFE SHOULD DEPICT THE POWER AND DEMONSTRATION OF WHO I AM IN CHRIST JESUS. JESUS. &gt;&gt; SEE, AND SO THE POWER AND DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT I SHOULD BE, OF ALL THAT [screaming] GOD WANTS ME TO BE. AND FRIENDS, I'm right here with you today too many times. I I LOOK BACK AT THE TRAIL OF MY LIFE JUST IN A GIVEN 24 HOURS AND I GO, "LORD, IF I'M HONEST, and you should be before God, I I I DON'T REALLY THAT THAT STRAIGHT LINE OF THE WORD, I SEE SOME wobbles and some missteps and I tripped there, Lord, and I'm awfully sorry about that. You forgive me." He will. AND HE'LL CLEANSE YOU OF ANY EFFECT OF THE UNRIGHTEOUSNESS AND PURIFY you all over again. &gt;&gt; BUT LET'S BE UP AND ABOUT THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. YOU CAN'T LET FAILURE KEEP YOU DOWN. YOU GOT TO KEEP FIGHTING. I MADE A PROMISE TO THE LORD MANY YEARS AGO. I CAN'T PROMISE I WON'T STUMBLE, BUT I PROMISE I'LL KEEP FIGHTING. I CAN'T PROMISE I MIGHT SIDESTEP, [screaming] BUT I PROMISE YOU I'LL REPENT. I PROMISE YOU I'LL GET BACK UP. I'LL KEEP FIGHTING. I'LL NEVER STOP FIGHTING. YOU'LL TAKE ME FROM THIS EARTH FIGHTING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO THE GOSPEL THEN WE REALIZE THAT THE GOSPEL CAME NOT IN WORD ONLY BUT IN POWER AND demonstration of the divine element of the word that is in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want TO SAY IT LIKE THAT AGAIN. I'VE COME INTO THE WORD. SO THE GOSPEL CAME NOT INTO THE IN THE CAME NOT IN WORD ONLY. I'M I'M I'M I'M taking off on PAUL'S STATEMENT. THE GOSPEL CAME NOT IN WORD ONLY, IN DOCTRINAL TEACHING ONLY, BUT IT CAME IN POWER AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE DIVINE ELEMENT THAT'S IN THE WORD &gt;&gt; THAT'S IN ME THAT I'M BELIEVING THAT I'M FEEDING ON THAT I HAVE AN AFFINITY WITH THAT THAT THAT PEOPLE CAN GET AROUND ME AND THEY CAN JUST CLOSE THEIR EYES AND ENJOY THE ETERNAL LIFE THAT flows from me. &gt;&gt; Amen. SO I'VE COME INTO THE WORLD WHERE ARE YOU ELECTED? &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE IN ELECTION BY ORIGIN. THEN HEAR ME WHEN I SAY I'VE COME INTO THE WORLD NOT IN ELECTION ONLY BUT IN THE POWER AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE ELECTION THAT I'M A PART OF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Satan with his counter claim. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. Of course, brother Brandham and I I'm going to skip a lot of this. Brother Brandham talks about how that the stars of heaven are sons of God. He covers that in um the Genesis 15:5 covers it. Job 38 um 6-7 morning stars are singing together. Um and and so so and brother Brandham applies the sides of the north would be the location of the temple of God's presence since Satan THAT JUST SHOWS YOU HE'S DESIRING worship &gt;&gt; because HE WANTS TO SIT IN THE TEMPLE OF GOD AND BE LIKE GOD. &gt;&gt; SO LISTEN FRIENDS, LISTEN YOUNG PEOPLE, HE DESIRES YOUR WORSHIP AND YOU GIVE IT TO HIM WHEN YOU FOLLOW HIS LEAD. &gt;&gt; So I'm not burning incense. I'm not on my knees. I'm not uh humming, you know, satanic words. That's not He don't need that. What? That doesn't even do him ANY GOOD. HE'S ALREADY GOT the heathen. The ones that's hindering him is you and me. He's trying to get you to worship him in your lifestyle. SOMETHING THAT BRINGS HIM honor and glory. See? AND INSTEAD OF OFFERING THE world a well that never runs dry, you feed them poison. &gt;&gt; See? SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM POINTS OUT IN THE IN THE GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE, Satan is not called the God of any other age, but this age, it was his ambition to be like God FROM CATCH THIS NOW. YOU GOOD? &gt;&gt; YEAH, you heard me in so many weeks. You should give me a little liberty. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. MY VOICE IS STARTING TO HURT. I'M STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT FEVERISH, BUT I WANT TO KEEP PREACHING. Can I do that? &gt;&gt; YOU PROMISE YOU'LL PAY ATTENTION? &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE, I'm not going to go too long. [clears throat] So, Brother Brandham says it was his ambition TO BE LIKE GOD. AND HERE'S THE key from the very beginning. &gt;&gt; See? So, so when he uh So, now think with me. Think with me. SO IF IT WAS HIS AMBITION TO BE LIKE GOD FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, THEN WHEN HE APPROACHED EVE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME, it was part of a plan. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; He didn't just walk through the garden PASSED BY EVE AND GO, "HM, I got an idea." His [snorts] This is This predates Genesis. THIS THIS GOES BACK WHEN MORNING STARS SANG TOGETHER AND SONS OF GOD SHOUTED FOR JOY. THERE WAS AN ANGEL who didn't like the way he didn't like the system. SOMETHING ABOUT IT BOTHERED HIM, STUCK IN HIS CRAWL AND he wanted to do something different. &gt;&gt; SO HE DEVELOPS THIS GRAND SCHEME and I'm here to TELL YOU THAT THE SCHEME HAS PROGRESSED FROM THE PLANNING STAGE. AT ONE TIME IN LUCIFER IT WAS IN A PLANNING STAGE BUT IT WENT FROM THE PLANNING STAGE TO FULLY OPERATIONAL. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO IN THE MILITARY. YOU HAVE A PLAN, BUT EVENTUALLY YOU'RE GOING TO NOT JUST KEEP PLANNING. IT'S GOING TO BECOME OPERATIONAL. SEE, and it's going to HAVE AN OPERATIONAL STATUS. SO, SO, SO CAN I SAY THAT WHEN WHEN WHEN SATAN SHOWS UP, AND HE WILL AFTER THIS SERVICE IS OVER AND YOU GO HOME, WHEN HE SHOWS UP TO TAKE YOU DOWN THAT SAME OLD PATH THAT HE ALWAYS TAKES YOU DOWN, JUST SAY TO YOURSELF, "THIS WAS A PLAN. &gt;&gt; HE'S TRYING TO SPRING A TRAP ON ME THAT HE HAS THOUGHT [screaming] ABOUT FOR YEARS. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; He fully expects you to come along as usual. So, note to self. Ready to make a note to self? NOTE TO SELF. NUMBER ONE, this is part of a plan he made right while I was sitting in church rejoicing over the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; NOTE TO SELF. NUMBER TWO, this is part of a plan he made that's been operational since the day he saw me born into the world. And if you can just get your mind to look at his temptations in that way that this is a scheme and a plan to take you down, to take him down, to take his throne through you, I'm going to tell you something. It'll put a lot more backbone in you. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad God never needed a planning stage like that. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; say he didn't need a planning stage. No, brother Brandham said every thought he has ever had, he has always had. [laughter] Hallelujah. He is immutable. He is unable to be changed. Brother Brandham said in the in the in THE CHURCH AGE BOOK, SATAN KNOWS THAT SINCE GOD IS IMMUTABLE IN HIS NATURE, then he is just AS IMMUTABLE IN HIS WAYS. SO, SO, SO SINCE HIS thoughts uh are his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his word is unchangeable. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THEN THAT MEANS HIS THOUGHTS OF ME are immutable. &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS HIS THOUGHTS OF ME ARE UNCHANGEABLE. LUCIFER CAN SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS. HE CAN JUMP UP AND DOWN, THROW DIRT IN THE AIR, SET HIMSELF ON FIRE. I DON'T CARE. HIS THOUGHTS ARE NOT IMMUTABLE, BUT GOD'S THOUGHTS ARE IMMUTABLE. THAT MEANS THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE EVER TRICKED ME INTO, STUMBLED ME UP, NO MATTER WHAT EVER HAPPENED. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS REPENT AND GOD CLEANSES ME AND FORGIVES ME. AND NOTHING SATAN EVER DOES [screaming] IS UNCHANGEABLE IN MY LIFE. THE ONLY THING UNCHANGEABLE IS I CAME INTO THE WORLD TO LOVE [screaming] GOD. AND I CAME INTO THE WORLD TO BELIEVE HIS WORD. AND I CAME INTO THE WORLD TO ENJOY THE WORLD FOR ETERNITY. NOTHING Satan has ever done. I just want to I WANT TO SINK THAT IN ON YOU HARD BEFORE I GO TO MY LAST POINT for today. [sighs and gasps] More to say, but I'm going to hit this in one more part. Nothing that Satan has thought about me. You see, his thoughts are changeable because there's a higher power &gt;&gt; and I'm connected and serve the higher power. &gt;&gt; You see friends, his Satan's thoughts are not unchangeable. The new birth changed everything. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The new birth changed everything. Doesn't even matter what he put on me. I want you to absorb that today. I don't know what sin and failure has caused. You may be under the affliction of some failure and you brought it on yourself. And I'm I'm just going to here to tell you something today that even it doesn't matter what Satan has ever done, how he trapped you, how he tricked you. Nothing hangs on to the son and daughter of God. ONCE YOU HAVE PASSED FROM DEATH UNTO LIFE, AS FAR AS GOD is concerned, YOU ARE AS PERFECT as Jesus Christ. You might have to live out this life and and the sad RESULT OF SOMETHING ELSE. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, EVEN GOD CAN JUST START SEWING NEW SEED OVER THE TOP OF THAT OLD SEED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. JUST THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT HAZARUS DID FOR ESTHER. HE COULDN'T CHANGE HIS WORD. GOD CAN'T CHANGE HIS WORD. WHATSOEVER YOU SOW, THAT'S WHAT YOU REAP. AND SO WHEN ESTHER SAYS, "JUST CHANGE THAT." HE SAYS, "I CAN'T. I'M I'M A HAZARDOUS AND I CHANGE NOT. I'M GOD AND I CHANGE NOT. &gt;&gt; BUT HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO, ESTHER. I'LL WRITE A NEW COMMANDMENT. WHAT? WHAT? AND ON THE DAY THAT THAT THE SENTENCE IS GOING TO BE CARRIED OUT AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REAP ALL OF THIS TERRIBLE CROP THAT'S BEEN SWN AND IT GOT SWN BY A TRICKERY BY AN EVIL MAN WHO HATES YOU CALLED THE DEVIL. BUT ON THE DAY BEFORE HE CAN CARRY IT OUT AND DRAG [screaming] YOU OFF TO HELL, BEFORE THAT HAPPENS, YOU I'LL ISSUE A NEW LAW THAT YOU CAN DESTROY YOUR ENEMIES. SO WHEN THE WHEN THE SEED COMES UP, THE EFFECT OF IT HAS BEEN DESTROYED. I'M GOING TO HERE TO TELL YOU TODAY, JUST START SEWING NEW SEED OVER THE TOP OF THAT OLD SEED. AND WHEN IT COME BY GETTING PEOPLE TO DISBELIEVE HIM, HOW MUCH COULD YOU MAKE HIS WORD OF NO EFFECT BY BELIEVING THE WORD OF GOD? &gt;&gt; That includes and is BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT ME AND ALSO ABOUT YOU. THE BIBLE SAYS IN 2 CHRONICLES 16:9, "FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD RUN TO AND FRO THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE earth to show himself strong &gt;&gt; in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him." &gt;&gt; He has thoughts of all of us, &gt;&gt; sitting in this tabernacle &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; I really want that to sink in. He has thoughts. God has thoughts of you. You just got out of bed, stumbled into some clothes, put on whatever your wife told you, grabbed your keys, went out the door, came into church. You're sitting here today. I'm here to tell you, God had angels waiting on you. He knew you were coming. He He ordained the word for you to preach. I'm here to tell you something. If his if his thoughts were of me sitting in this tabernacle this morning, then he certainly has thoughts about me sitting at a table thousands of miles long. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. FRIENDS, WHEN WE CAN LOOK ACROSS THE AISLE AT ALL OF OUR LOVED ONES WHO'VE GONE ON AND WE'RE ALL BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND THROUGH TEARS, WE CAN REACH AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WE'LL REACH ACROSS AND GRAB ONE ANOTHER. WE MADE [laughter] IT. WE MADE IT. WE MADE IT. WE MADE IT." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S NO THOUGHT OF SATAN CAN UNDO THAT IN MY LIFE. Brother Brandham goes on to show Satan's ambition. I don't need to keep going over it. I know he he talks about how that that scripture Lucifer's son of the morning. I will ascend and be in the congregation, mount of the congregation of the sides of the north was Satan's ambition to be ambition to be worshiped like God. Um Paul teaches that 2 Thessalonians 2:4, Psalms 48:2. Daniel when he comes to Daniel 11:37, neither shall HE REGARD THE GOD of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god, for he shall magnify himself above all. SEE TH THIS IS NO DOUBT DANIEL I IS IS seeing this WHOLE GREAT CONFLICT. JOHN ISAIAH TALKS ABOUT THAT HE SAW THE throne room of God in Isaiah 6. John saw it in in Revelation 4. AND AND SO SO WE FIND OUT THEN THAT THAT WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS HE CANNOT BE CALLED THE GOD OF ANY OTHER AGE BUT THIS AGE. HE SAYS IN THE GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE. PARAGRAPH 77. IN WHOM THE GOD OF THIS WORLD HATH BLINDED THE MINDS OF THEM WHICH believe not lest THE LIGHT OF THE GLORIOUS GOSPEL OF CHRIST WHO IS THE IMAGE OF GOD SHOULD SHINE UNTO THEM. AND HE'S REFERENCING, of course, 2 Corinthians 4:4. SO, SATAN, NOW WATCH THIS. ALL RIGHT, I'm I'm I'm nearing the end. You good? &gt;&gt; Can I get 10 minutes? I THINK I GOT 10 MINUTES OF FUEL LEFT. SO, [clears throat] so Satan was beautiful. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was next level &gt;&gt; beautiful. &gt;&gt; Lucifer. Lucifer. There was no angel like him. He was an archangel and he was perfect in all of his ways and his his beauty was remarkable. And he WAS HE WAS SECOND ONLY TO THE ARCHANGEL MICHAEL. AND SO, SO WE FIND THAT THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SHOWS THAT SCRIPTURALLY SPEAKING, real beauty is holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Real beauty, sisters, brothers, IS NOT HOW MUCH MAKEUP YOU CAN PUT ON, DOLL UP, TIGHTEN UP YOUR CLOTHES, JACK up your heels, &gt;&gt; sag your pants, &gt;&gt; LET YOUR HAIR GROW down into into bangs. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Trim the ends of your hair, color it. &gt;&gt; That's not beauty. &gt;&gt; That's m That's artificial. &gt;&gt; Putting all those colored colors that are not your NATURAL FINGER AND TOENAILS. SHAME ON YOU SISTERS for doing things like that. YOU SHOULD NOT DO THAT. THAT GRIEVES the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You handle that. You talk that over with the Lord. You won't do that. See, be real. Beauty means holiness. &gt;&gt; And so, SO OF ALL THE ANGELS that were beautiful in their holiness, LUCIFER IS ACTUALLY SINGLED OUT FOR IT. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE EVEN SAID HE WAS JUST PERFECT. OTHER TRANSLATIONS, FLAWLESS. HE WAS THE PINNACLE OF righteous appearing beauty &gt;&gt; until sin was discovered in him &gt;&gt; UNTIL IT HE WAS SO ELEVATED AND RECOGNIZED AMONG his fellows. YOU CAN SEE WHY EXACTLY THAT WHEN [snorts] HE ANOINTED PHARISEES Jesus accused them of that. They said, he said, "You Pharisees, you love to stand in the markets. I got your number. YOU THINK YOU'RE PIOUS AND HOLY. I KNOW WHAT I KNOW YOU'RE full of dead men's bones. YOU LOVE STANDING ON THE CORNER AND LIFTING UP HOLY PRAYERS AND WEARING YOUR long robes and everybody will go, "Oh, what a beautifully holy man." &gt;&gt; And he said, "You're you're you're of your father, the devil." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you're murderers and liars. See? AND SO, SO IT QUITE NATURALLY WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PHARISEES, which was legalism, &gt;&gt; started in Lucifer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So holiness WHEN IT IS HOLINESS FOR THE SAKE OF BEING ADMIRED AND [clears throat] RECOGNIZED AND AND AND ELEVATED THAT IS HOLINESS LEGALISM AND IT'S OF the devil. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? IT'S OF THE DEVIL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. IT BECOMES PRIDEFUL LEGALISM AND LUCIFER EXCELLED in it. HE HE EXTOLLED IT. HE HE HE GLORIFIED IT IN IN ALL OF HIS SERMONS. SEE, UN he he he and HE USED TO BROTHER BRAM TALKS ABOUT HIM PREACHING PREACHING TO THE OTHER ANGELS AND HE HE GLORIFIED HIS LEGALISTIC HOLINESS &gt;&gt; IN THE MINDS OF ALL THE OTHER ANGELS UNTIL IT NOT GOD UNTIL HIS LEGALISM BECAME praiseworthy among a third of the other angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a third of the other angels fell for prideful legalism &gt;&gt; and called it beautiful. And brother Brandham says that's why they decorate their altars and build big crystal cathedrals and robe their choirs and all the beauty and all the pump and all the pageant pageantry that started in heaven under Lucifer. Amen. The ancient people, Paul said, worshiped creation more than the creator until finally it would become what started in heaven first, a denomination of sorts, a cult as it were, OF A GRANDIZING BEAUTY. NO LONGER A NATURAL PASSION TIED to his love of God and his word. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHAT PRIDEFUL LEGALISM IS. It has IT IT IT CEASES BEING TIED TO YOUR LOVE FOR GOD AND HIS WORD AND IT BECOMES PRIDEFUL arrogance &gt;&gt; where we judge everybody else inferior below us who don't keep our standards. That is of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is of the devil. Friends, I I'm gonna That's why I constantly remind us we are all in this thing together. &gt;&gt; There's no big I's and little U's. If he had not left us a seed, we too would be all together like unto Sodom and Gomorrah. I'm going to tell YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. BETHL TABERNACLE, WE HAVE NO ROOM FOR THAT HERE. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN PRIDEFUL LEGALISM. I WANT PEOPLE WHO LOVE GOD, WHO LOVE HIS WORD. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO OUT HERE AND AND WALK A CHALK LINE JUST BECAUSE I SAY YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT. WHAT DID I SAY A MINUTE AGO? GO PRAY. TALK TO THE HOLY SPIRIT AS YOU'RE I DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW YOU AROUND AND CHECK ON YOU. I JUST SAY, "LORD GOD, HOLY GHOST, YOU FOLLOW THEM AROUND. YOU CHECK ON THEM. YOU TALK TO THEM. [screaming] TALK TO THEM WHEN THEY WAKE UP. TALK TO THEM WHEN THEY GO TO SLEEP. I'LL SEE YOU COME IN THAT DOOR. AND THE BEAUTY OF HOLINESS WILL BE ON YOU HERE. IT'LL BE ON YOU THERE. IT'LL BE ON YOU EVERYWHERE YOU GO. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, ABSOLUTELY. The world as I I'm I'm to my final point now. THE WORLD IS FACING A CLIMAX. &gt;&gt; Dueling claims to a single throne. Dueling claims TO A SINGLE DOMINION. Dueling claims TO A SINGLE POSITION THAT ONLY ONE OF these two beings &gt;&gt; can accomplish. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I THINK ABOUT Lucifer when he AND I I'M PROBABLY JUST NOW COMING TO THE real burden on my heart and it won't take me long to get it out because it's just such a reality WHEN I THINK OF LUCIFER there in all of his beauty, all of his pride and his his egotism and his pomp and a and how everything just turned into a cult and a denomination that he preached his way as a false prophet and a third of the angelic host followed him in it. Don't think it's not a powerful doctrine. It's very powerful. I've seen it destroy churches before. IT NEVER I JUST SAID TO MYSELF SOME WEEKS AGO, it never OCCURRED TO SATAN WHEN HE STOOD BESIDE that throne to notice that as the Bible says, his throne is established in mercy &gt;&gt; WHEN AS YET THERE WAS NO NEED TO BE MERCIFUL. NOTHING WAS LOST. NOTHING WAS WRONG. SIN DIDN'T YET EXIST. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IN HIS FORNOWLEDGE BUILD A THRONE OUT OF MERCY. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING SO ARROGANT AND SELFADMIRING AND SO PRIDEFUL AND SO SELF ASSURED THAT YOU WERE BLIND TO REDEMPTION? IMAGES OF REDEMPTION ALL AROUND YOU. AND THERE WAS NOTHING EVEN LOST. AND IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO LUCIFER. BUT GOD KNEW WHEN HE SAID TO ADAM, "UH, RE MULTIPLY AND REPLENISH THE EARTH." AND BROTHER SAID, "IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, SOMETHING WOULD HAVE TO DIE." GOD [screaming] ALREADY KNEW HE WOULD BE A REDEEMER. HE ALREADY KNEW YOU'D BE BORN IN SIN. HE ALREADY KNEW HE'D SEND A MESSAGE. HE ALREADY KNEW I'D BE A BELIEVER. HE ALREADY KNEW YOU WOULD TAKE IT. HE ALREADY KNEW YOU'D BECOME A WORSHSHIPER OF THE TRUE GOD. [screaming] AND SATAN CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW HE DOESN'T HAVE YOU AND HE STUMBLED YOU AND TRIPPED YOU AND BEAT YOU. BUT HERE YOU STAND TODAY. [screaming] YOU'RE STILL A BELIEVER AND YOU'RE STILL STANDING. YOU'RE STILL MOVING FORWARD. AND THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN DO ABOUT IT [screaming] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HIS THRONE WAS ESTABLISHED IN MERCY. AND I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TODAY, FRIENDS, DON'T KEEP GOING DOWN THE PRIMROSE PATH THAT SATAN HAS TOLD YOU YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO. THE WORLD IS YOUR OYSTER. THIS WORLD HAS NOTHING LIKE AN OYSTER. THIS WORLD HAS NOTHING ABOUT CAKE AND DESSERT. THIS WORLD IS GOING TO FIRE [screaming] AND BRIMSTONE IS GOING TO BE RAIN DOWN UPON IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Not only a nuclear fire, but holy fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND GOD TODAY is speaking to hearts TO SAY THERE'S NO future in a life apart from God's word. I don't care what plans you have made. Satan, listen, Satan didn't catch it. He he literally he literally missed the grandest part in creation. And you know what that was? Redemption. &gt;&gt; He never figured that something could be lost and already purchased before it was born &gt;&gt; so that when it was born it would already come up born in sin but with a gene that the Holy Spirit could come and take it back. And that's the part he never counted on. Oh, now as we read now the universe can be filled with the glory of God. As Paul said in Romans 11, for of him and through him and to him are all things. To whom be glory forever. So, Satan and God both making claims to lordship and kingdom and the choice is easy. God leaves it to every man and woman to make their choice. There's two leaders. They're making polar opposite claims. The world seems to be, you'd almost think that you better put in with the devil because the whole world is given over to it. And it looks like and he's the god of this evil age and he's got Satan's Eden and it just looks like you you could just go right on forever. But I'm here to tell you something, young people. Listen to me. He's got nothing ahead of you but darkness, misery, slavery, poverty, brokenness. But I'm here to tell you, there's a redeemer. &gt;&gt; Stand to your feet with me today. There's a redeemer, friends. And that is what Satan cannot account for. He cannot account for the fact that you can walk into this building today, a black, smutty, dark sinner, and leave here clean, righteous, true holiness, true purity. How many would like that kind of an exit today? Why don't you bow your heads with me all over the building? Father, I come to the end of this sermon today, Lord. And I'm quite finished from where I wanted to get to. And I'm grateful to you, grateful to the people. And Lord, I just committed to you. I I I I've preached the word as honest as I could. I've been as forthright. I've held nothing back. Every moment as I'm going through my notes and the Holy Spirit prompted me to inject something fresh. I didn't disobey you. I said it. I didn't understand everything I said. I don't even know what all I said, but I know it was of you. &gt;&gt; So I pray today, Lord, there's young and old here alike. There's sinner and saint here alike. There's those who who have known you. They've known you. They've had experiences with you. I wouldn't doubt that at all. But they're still lacking that [snorts] certain [music] something, that one moment in your presence that changes everything. [music] It's not just a feeling. It's not just a sensation. It doesn't last more. It lasts more than a couple days. It'll literally go with them all the way to glory. I pray today, Lord. I pray for THE YOUNG AND THE OLD. I PRAY FOR THE married and the single. I pray sinner and saint. I PRAY THAT WE WILL ALL UNDERSTAND a little better today what it is that you are desiring. To the believer, our life is supposed to be a beacon. It's supposed to be a voice to the world that can bring the dying and the thirsty to you. That's what our life as a believer is supposed to be, Lord. To the sinner who has never surrendered his heart to you fully. It's so easy to do. Satan clouds it, muddies the water, makes it complicated. They They think they have to do some certain thing, have some certain reaction, they're going to have to change this about their life or give up that or quit this. They don't have to do any of that. All they have to do is surrender. say, "Lord Jesus, not only do not only do is the preacher telling me I don't need to do that, I don't even think I could do that." And even if I did, it wouldn't last. Lord, I need something that'll last. I pray, master, that you'll speak to hearts right now. Sinner boy, sinner girl, IF YOU DON'T know the Lord, and maybe you've known him, you've known of him, BUT IF YOU'VE NEVER REALLY KNOWN HIM IN THAT THING, THAT'LL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER. WHY DON'T YOU JUST RAISE UP THAT HAND TO him right now? Say, "Lord God, be merciful to me, a sinner. BE MERCIFUL TO ME. I'VE I'VE EXPERIENCED YOU. I'VE KNOWN YOU. BUT I NEED THAT CERTAIN CERTAIN SOMETHING THAT PUTS ME IN THE PATH OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE." LORD, I pray that sinner and saint will move up a level today. That the righteous will move up a level. THAT YOUR FAMILY WILL INCREASE THEIR DEDICATION TO YOU. and those who haven't known you will know you in in your power and in your resurrection. I commit it to you today. That's why we preach, Lord. That's why that throne was established in mercy. I know the devil might be telling them, "It's too late. You've gone too far. You're too broken. Are you even sure you even want that?" Lord, that's the whole reason you built a throne out of mercy. My goodness, you could have built it out of anything. You established your throne in mercy. That was THE WHOLE YOU PREPARED THE GROUND CAREFULLY. You built it with care. You put IT IN PLACE. YOU BUILT YOUR THRONE IN such a way that the sinner no matter what condition his life in his life is in, he can come and kneel before that throne and say, "God, be merciful to me." and you can and Satan can't hold him any longer. I commit it to you, Father. I've preached, my body is spent, and I can't keep going. But Lord, somehow in my spirit, I just linger. Oh God, deal with [music] hearts today. Don't let one, not not a not one who's already righteous, don't let one leave here without elevating their life to you and [music] become closer. Don't let one who's who come in today without a new birth leave without a new birth. May they experience you in the Holy Ghost. WEARY LORD, BUT NOT DEFEATED, I STAND HERE AS A IN THE GAP AND PRAY THIS PRAYER that you'll have mercy on us one and all.
