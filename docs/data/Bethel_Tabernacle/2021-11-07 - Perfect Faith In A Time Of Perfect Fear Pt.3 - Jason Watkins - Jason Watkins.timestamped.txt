[43:59] amen god bless you friends you can be
[44:00] seated
[44:05] oh excellent okay
[44:10] [Music]
[44:16] i wish by the help of the lord today to
[44:20] carry on in the little
[44:23] series that i've been working on faith
[44:25] versus fear
[44:27] and we've been taking a subtitle perfect
[44:30] faith in a time of perfect fear
[44:33] there are
[44:34] um nearly um well it wouldn't i suppose
[44:38] be completely innumerable you could
[44:40] actually make the list but it would be
[44:42] lengthy and long
[44:45] of the things that i could that i could
[44:47] name to you
[44:48] from the scriptures and show you the
[44:51] various
[44:52] prophecies that relate to
[44:55] uniquely the hour uh getting some
[45:00] echoey kind of thing brother mark so
[45:02] maybe a little less hot monitor maybe
[45:06] and
[45:07] and that the things that were prophesied
[45:10] to come to pass uniquely in the day and
[45:13] hour
[45:14] that we live
[45:16] and it it's not in every case
[45:19] uh to say that us that it wasn't under
[45:22] partial fulfillment uh or at least
[45:25] certainly true in the world in times
[45:28] past for instance we've used this one
[45:30] very often
[45:31] is that the apostle paul writing to
[45:34] timothy says that in the last days
[45:36] perilous times shall come now it was not
[45:39] to suggest that perilous times weren't
[45:42] there as he was writing it i think
[45:44] brother paul could talk a lot about
[45:46] perilous times and so he he talks about
[45:49] being a night in the day in the deep
[45:51] being robbed being betrayed of his own
[45:54] countrymen being beaten 39 stripes twice
[45:58] being imprisoned and all kinds of things
[46:01] sometimes if i get to feeling too sorry
[46:03] for myself i go back and read about
[46:05] paul's life i'm here to tell you
[46:06] something that brother went through it
[46:08] all of them did and so uh they they did
[46:12] not have an easy way to go so they
[46:13] certainly had perilous times but paul is
[46:16] referencing a particular level of peril
[46:20] that would come in the last days he goes
[46:22] on to break it down and detail it and in
[46:24] fact is it's in the detail that we can
[46:27] see so clearly that it is a reference to
[46:29] our day where men shall be truths
[46:32] breakers and false accusers and
[46:33] incontinent fears and despisers of those
[46:35] that are good heady high-minded and
[46:37] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[46:39] god and so that's always been true just
[46:42] like jesus said you'll have wars and
[46:44] rumors of wars the end is not yet these
[46:45] things must come uh summer is nigh and
[46:48] then when you see all of these things
[46:50] lift up your head your redemption draws
[46:52] nice so we see the process of prophecy
[46:55] down through the ages where god has
[46:58] promised certain things that would come
[47:00] now it's it's comforting to me very
[47:03] comforting to me that he also that you
[47:06] know writes in the same way you know
[47:09] among the other apostles the holy spirit
[47:11] moves on the scene to say listen that
[47:13] you know don't don't forget that you god
[47:17] gives you a way to be an overcomer and
[47:19] there's actually practical steps that
[47:21] you can take and and one apostle pins to
[47:24] say listen make sure you're on the
[47:26] lookout you people at the end time make
[47:29] sure you're on the lookout for the for
[47:32] the grace that'll be given at the
[47:34] revelation of jesus christ i'm here to
[47:36] say got it paul thank you amen i was
[47:39] looking out for that and i found it i'm
[47:41] under a particular unique grace in this
[47:44] hour amen
[47:46] and so we find that god would come back
[47:49] in this day you know when the so there's
[47:51] there's so much about this bride of
[47:54] christ today that is unique she will be
[47:57] taking a body change the early church
[47:59] couldn't do that they they slipped back
[48:01] they fell away they turned cold and they
[48:04] the church backslid and instead of
[48:07] christ being able to come and uh take a
[48:09] bride for himself he had to sit back
[48:12] down in the eternities intercede on
[48:14] behalf of the ignorance of the people
[48:16] seal up the word in seven seals but he
[48:19] promised at the last day in a unique
[48:22] hour he would come and he would break
[48:24] those seals open
[48:26] and he would unveil himself and when he
[48:28] unveiled himself the when the mighty god
[48:30] was unveiled we saw once again for the
[48:34] first time in 2000 years we saw the
[48:37] mighty god unveiled again perfectly in
[48:40] his family
[48:41] so now the alpha that was what they had
[48:43] they they were not lacking in the token
[48:46] they were not lacking in the
[48:47] understanding you're certainly not going
[48:48] to get more understanding than saint
[48:50] paul had every doctrine we teach is
[48:52] based on his teaching and so we find
[48:55] that that it would that god promised
[48:58] that it would come back in a restoration
[49:00] so that a bride could once again feed on
[49:04] the full word to come into the fullness
[49:06] to take a body change at last amen
[49:09] aren't you glad to be part of that
[49:12] finally after
[49:13] 2 000 years and seven contiguous ages we
[49:17] find that a bride is now ready to enter
[49:20] into that unique position of taking uh
[49:23] uh for a global bride to go all together
[49:28] in a moment amen in the twinkling of an
[49:31] eye and be changed and caught up to meet
[49:33] the lord amen
[49:36] we find that
[49:37] because of this god would
[49:40] need and of necessity
[49:42] he would he would have to
[49:44] there would be a great need and he would
[49:46] thus promise that in the last day
[49:49] because that it would be so uniquely
[49:51] perilous
[49:52] because it would be so uniquely dark not
[49:55] only on the whole earth but gross darkly
[49:58] darkness on the people's minds
[50:00] and so in order to do this
[50:03] in order to get a bride
[50:05] to be able to to have perfect faith he
[50:08] would have to come in such a way that
[50:10] the bride could receive it
[50:13] and and allow
[50:15] that reception of that word to change
[50:18] her i'm here to tell you something
[50:20] friends you are what you eat what you
[50:23] feed on you're you're transformed into
[50:25] the things you gaze at the bible teaches
[50:27] us and so we find that god would send
[50:30] this word to do what faith comes by
[50:32] hearing what the word and so if we're
[50:35] going to take if we're going to have a
[50:37] perfect faith aren't we going to need a
[50:39] perfect word if we're going to come to
[50:41] perfection aren't we going to need a
[50:43] perfect god to keep a perfect promise
[50:47] amen this is just logic common sense
[50:50] there's no way the church in her
[50:52] condition at the end of laodicea as it's
[50:54] described to us in revelation 3
[50:57] there's no way when you read that
[50:59] description no wonder brother branham
[51:01] could say the situation for the church
[51:03] at the last day was that they couldn't
[51:06] go in the rapture like they were that's
[51:08] bad enough
[51:10] but as if that's not bad enough he would
[51:12] go on to say and it can't get any better
[51:15] why because they've already put christ
[51:17] out crucified him the second time but
[51:19] there is a bride who is loving that word
[51:22] and loving his appearing as paul said he
[51:24] would do
[51:26] he would appear and all those who love
[51:28] that appearing have a crown of
[51:30] righteousness awaiting them
[51:32] now you surely believe by now that you
[51:35] could never get yourself in a rapture
[51:39] surely you believe by now we dealt with
[51:41] this last time i remember in the
[51:43] scripture where we showed how that
[51:46] jehoshaphat the difference between
[51:48] i mean hezekiah the difference between
[51:50] him and cinecrab when he come into from
[51:52] egypt and surrounded jerusalem and
[51:55] threatened to sack it and and he he made
[51:57] all these boasts there's no god that can
[51:59] protect you and and hezekiah began to
[52:02] encourage the people to say listen he's
[52:04] got the he's got he's trusting in the
[52:07] arm of flesh but we are trusting in
[52:09] almighty god
[52:11] and almighty god cannot be defeated by
[52:13] almighty flesh it's impossible and so
[52:17] they they took courage in that and
[52:19] that's the message for you today because
[52:21] we're preaching on faith versus fear
[52:24] we're taking a perfect faith in a time
[52:26] of perfect fear and i'm here to tell you
[52:28] you don't have to fall victim to that
[52:31] perfect fear you can you have an
[52:33] opportunity to live in perfect faith
[52:38] now the difference between perfect faith
[52:40] and human faith is in human faith it's
[52:42] you operating it in perfect faith it's
[52:45] god operating it in you
[52:47] by a revelation that you have opened
[52:49] your heart to and you have received it
[52:51] and i'm here to tell you it is doing
[52:53] more in you than you are even aware of
[52:56] [Applause]
[52:58] thank god for that
[53:00] because that i i i constantly walk
[53:03] through the house and every time i pass
[53:05] in front of a mirror and i just i look
[53:07] at that guy looking back at me and i say
[53:08] man there's no chance for you you're
[53:10] never going to get in a rapture but i
[53:12] know that i'm looking at the wrong thing
[53:14] when i look at that i need to look at a
[53:16] promise
[53:17] and i need to look and say but in my
[53:19] heart i believe the promise
[53:22] see
[53:24] so it's
[53:25] it's it's not that it's not that
[53:28] believing the word
[53:32] is like a uh
[53:37] it's a reward uh it's not like
[53:39] it's not like eternal life is a reward
[53:43] for believing the word
[53:45] you didn't you know you didn't hit a
[53:47] lotto
[53:48] it's not what this is
[53:50] right it is so so i'm going to say it
[53:52] again
[53:53] eternal life
[53:55] is not a reward
[53:57] for believing the word
[53:59] believing the word
[54:01] is an evidence of eternal life
[54:04] you see the difference
[54:06] don't look at it people say oh well i i
[54:08] i believe the word so i'm going to get
[54:10] to go to heaven it's not a reward
[54:13] your your faith in the word is an
[54:15] evidence that something has happened
[54:17] inside your heart
[54:19] and that's what the devil don't want you
[54:20] to understand because if he can get you
[54:22] to think it's a reward you'll never
[54:23] think you've earned it and it has
[54:25] nothing to do with you earning it it's
[54:26] the grace of almighty god that was to
[54:29] come at the revelation of jesus christ
[54:33] so be glad and rejoice for the bride
[54:36] whether you think it or not hath made
[54:38] herself ready
[54:40] amen and it's not you it's the word
[54:42] preparing your heart and your mind
[54:45] amen
[54:46] we're oftentimes believers in spite of
[54:48] ourselves yeah that's right thank god
[54:52] i'm glad i have an alien amen inside me
[54:55] that's different from me separate from
[54:57] me it's another being and he lives
[54:58] inside me and even when this outer man
[55:01] would stumble and fail the the inner man
[55:03] says amen
[55:05] hallelujah
[55:07] brother donnie has a wonderful drama
[55:09] that he does with that where he he says
[55:11] you know he says that inner man goes to
[55:13] church he said that outer man will say
[55:15] i'm too tired it's too wet and cold i
[55:17] don't want to go to church and the inner
[55:20] man says listen here buddy we're going
[55:22] to church now get dressed
[55:25] amen
[55:26] it's comical watching him do it he he he
[55:28] goes into a lot of depth on it but but
[55:30] it's true friends
[55:32] if you're only relying on your flesh or
[55:34] my flesh or anybody's flesh we've
[55:36] preached to you on this series already
[55:38] don't trust in the arm of flesh
[55:42] amen and the way that you get you say
[55:44] well i'm i'm in flesh how do i when i
[55:46] run away from myself and you can't do
[55:48] that but what peter did say is that you
[55:51] could add to your faith virtue and add
[55:53] to your virtue knowledge and add your
[55:54] knowledge timberson and if then build it
[55:56] up build it up build it up paul said it
[55:57] like this put on the whole armor of god
[56:00] see
[56:01] and put on the helmet of salvation those
[56:03] are those are metaphorical terms but we
[56:05] get it as human beings as christians we
[56:06] understand that our strength is in the
[56:08] word and there's strength and fellowship
[56:10] with the holy spirit amen and so so we
[56:13] find that the best way to overcome your
[56:16] flesh and to be the kind of man or woman
[56:19] that god foresaw you as before the
[56:22] foundation of the world is to take those
[56:23] practical steps this is not some
[56:26] mystical ethereal you know the the uh
[56:30] the greeks were like that they all just
[56:31] they loved hearing something new
[56:34] and they wanted paul to come back and
[56:35] preach to him again because they loved
[56:36] hearing those new things when paul
[56:38] finally turned the screws and went to
[56:40] the word then they were ready to murder
[56:41] him
[56:42] and so
[56:43] it's always going to be that way the
[56:45] enemy hates god and listen he's not just
[56:48] god's enemy he's your enemy
[56:51] and that's you know young people need to
[56:52] hear that constantly the devil's your
[56:54] enemy he's not your friend my goodness
[56:55] no
[56:56] he wants to kill you your parents your
[56:58] pastor everybody
[56:59] he he hates he hates your stand for the
[57:02] word he has the whole world but he hates
[57:04] that he don't have you
[57:05] he's got all the denominational systems
[57:08] and all the politics and all the
[57:09] education centers and he's got all the
[57:11] all the society and the fabric and the
[57:14] social integration and he's got control
[57:16] of all that it's satan's eden and it
[57:18] just burns him that he don't have this
[57:21] little bitty bride around the world i
[57:24] say we burn him
[57:26] i say we go out of here next week and
[57:28] just burn his hide living according to
[57:31] the word of god
[57:33] amen
[57:34] he's going to come after you whether you
[57:36] do or not why don't you go ahead and get
[57:37] your shots in
[57:39] see
[57:40] amen so
[57:42] we've been dealing with that
[57:45] that we have access to perfect faith in
[57:47] a time of perfect fear
[57:50] you won't survive
[57:51] if you don't press to live in perfect
[57:54] faith
[57:56] we know
[57:57] that for
[57:58] every effect there must be a cause
[58:01] physical science teaches us that
[58:04] but but there does not have to be
[58:07] on effect for every cause
[58:10] because god is uncaused
[58:13] amen
[58:14] amen god is uncaused
[58:17] he's the original cause and effect
[58:20] all in one aristotle deals with this
[58:23] effect when he tries to explain
[58:25] the origin of everything it's a futile
[58:27] attempt but i appreciated his attempt
[58:30] he goes he he he postulates that if
[58:33] there is anything that now exists and
[58:36] this is somewhat put in modern layman's
[58:37] terms
[58:38] you can actually find his original
[58:40] writings if there's anything that now
[58:42] exists
[58:43] then there had to be a cause greater
[58:45] than the things that were created
[58:48] and the indescribable infinite nature of
[58:50] the universe had a cause much greater
[58:53] than itself and that cause was god amen
[58:57] see
[58:58] he goes on what is greater
[59:01] the house that the builder built or the
[59:03] builder himself well of course it's the
[59:06] builder because without him there
[59:07] wouldn't be a house i don't care so no
[59:08] matter how great you build it the
[59:10] builder is still greater
[59:12] see
[59:12] so he's the original cause the building
[59:14] is only the effect all right so so
[59:18] therefore
[59:20] he teaches that the builder
[59:22] will always be greater than anything
[59:25] that he can build
[59:27] just as a creator has to be by necessity
[59:31] greater than anything he could create
[59:34] so aristotle saw the expanse of space
[59:37] as a living universe he called it that
[59:40] it's like it's a living universe a
[59:41] living universe he could see the
[59:43] movements he knew there was something
[59:45] driving it he knew it couldn't be an
[59:46] accident it was too perfect
[59:49] [Music]
[59:50] the stars and the bodies and the planets
[59:52] and the galaxies and everything that
[59:54] they could see and all he had was just
[59:55] you know crude instruments to see that
[59:58] but he but he could see the seasons and
[1:00:00] he could he could see how the tide is
[1:00:02] affected by the moon he could see what
[1:00:04] happens to crops in the sunlight he
[1:00:06] understood the the stars above his head
[1:00:09] and to to at least to a certain degree
[1:00:12] and he he considered it it would have to
[1:00:14] be a living universe and so so when he
[1:00:19] sees it like that and of course now this
[1:00:21] is exactly he's right that's exactly why
[1:00:24] the bible
[1:00:25] refers to the sun and the moon as christ
[1:00:28] in the church yeah amen see that's why
[1:00:31] brother branham would say the stars was
[1:00:33] his first bible this was his third one
[1:00:36] the second one was the one enoch built
[1:00:38] and the one in the stars and the one
[1:00:39] enoch built and this one all agree
[1:00:41] harmoniously
[1:00:43] all he's doing is he keeps getting
[1:00:45] within the stars you can see the virgin
[1:00:48] you can see leo the lion you can see the
[1:00:49] cross fishes they all fit to the gospel
[1:00:52] perfectly brother branham said it starts
[1:00:54] in the virgin and goes through the cross
[1:00:55] fishes comes to leo the lion and you can
[1:00:58] see that enoch built a little clear
[1:00:59] understanding of that in his pyramid
[1:01:01] seven steps to the king's chamber and
[1:01:03] and and this four sided uh you know with
[1:01:06] with a base and it goes up and there was
[1:01:08] no capstone put on it because he knocked
[1:01:11] went in a rapture and the the
[1:01:12] cornerstone which is a capstone on a
[1:01:14] pyramid was rejected and that and you
[1:01:17] see that happening in history those
[1:01:18] aren't accidents
[1:01:20] it's synchronous it's harmonious and
[1:01:22] that's why that's why when we read this
[1:01:25] word this word is synchronized to god
[1:01:27] just like the stars just like the
[1:01:30] pyramid and that's why when you feed on
[1:01:32] this you become synchronized to god your
[1:01:35] life becomes harmonious with god and
[1:01:38] nature amen amen the native american
[1:01:41] knew this he worshiped he didn't know
[1:01:42] exactly what but he worshipped something
[1:01:44] he worshipped the sun the moon he knew
[1:01:46] there was a higher power than himself
[1:01:49] that's why brother branham would call
[1:01:50] them some of them that we would call
[1:01:52] savages brother and said i call him a
[1:01:53] gentleman because he understood the laws
[1:01:55] of nature he didn't rape the land he
[1:01:57] didn't he didn't he didn't waste
[1:01:59] anything
[1:02:00] so so we find that god has been dealing
[1:02:03] with mankind through through the ages
[1:02:07] and and so anybody that has been willing
[1:02:10] to operate according to that intrinsic
[1:02:12] knowing
[1:02:14] then god has has a place for them he's
[1:02:15] always had that you know long before
[1:02:18] jesus ever struck the earth people were
[1:02:20] being given access to heaven
[1:02:22] now of course they were in paradise
[1:02:24] until christ ascended and then he
[1:02:26] emptied paradise out we're not here to
[1:02:28] teach on that today but i'm trying to
[1:02:30] make this point
[1:02:31] that that that we see that all heavenly
[1:02:34] bodies and planets and stars
[1:02:36] all move in precision and in the very
[1:02:40] nature of their movements now this is
[1:02:43] this is a great thought this is what
[1:02:44] aristotle was pointing at that in the
[1:02:47] very nature of their movement you can
[1:02:49] see that some
[1:02:51] force
[1:02:52] is driving them
[1:02:55] some force driving them to and not not
[1:02:58] just to move
[1:02:59] purposeless
[1:03:01] it's not just movement for the sake of
[1:03:03] movement
[1:03:04] i you i i could i could take this
[1:03:06] clicker and hurl it out into the aisle
[1:03:09] but what purpose would that serve
[1:03:11] if i wanted to use you'd have to bring
[1:03:13] it back to me so so god is not just
[1:03:16] moving things they're not just moving
[1:03:18] they were set in motion to accomplish
[1:03:21] something
[1:03:22] your life here is not just random
[1:03:25] movement in the earth at least it's not
[1:03:26] supposed to be
[1:03:28] your life was set here to be in a
[1:03:30] certain motion and when you look at the
[1:03:32] planets and the stars and the heavenly
[1:03:34] bodies you find that their movement is
[1:03:37] always a movement that tries to express
[1:03:40] the very nature and the very character
[1:03:43] of the mover amen and that's your life
[1:03:46] here your life here is set to be a
[1:03:49] movement to be a reflection to be a
[1:03:52] another image and and to to manifest the
[1:03:55] nature of the being who put you here
[1:03:59] amen so all nature
[1:04:01] it's it's amazing because because even
[1:04:04] even in even in fallen nature you know
[1:04:07] the very nature that we see that's
[1:04:09] fallen around us
[1:04:11] and and and even that fallen nature
[1:04:14] fallen with mankind into sin after the
[1:04:17] garden of eden even that nature
[1:04:20] struggles to do this
[1:04:23] even even nature it you you plant a crop
[1:04:28] and weeds will come up now
[1:04:30] but that crop will still try to grow
[1:04:32] right through that
[1:04:34] you you put seed under concrete and let
[1:04:36] the sun shine on it that that grass seed
[1:04:38] will grow sideways
[1:04:40] until it can come out and reach up to
[1:04:42] the sun
[1:04:43] so even in sin you understand the tides
[1:04:47] the the heavens the moon the sun the
[1:04:49] orbiting everything even under sin even
[1:04:53] under a fall
[1:04:55] that's why brother branham said if god
[1:04:58] had chosen the wind to preach the gospel
[1:05:00] we'd have been gone a long time ago he
[1:05:02] said if he'd chose the trees to preach
[1:05:04] the gospel we'd have been gone a long
[1:05:06] time ago because the wind would have
[1:05:08] just obeyed him the trees would have
[1:05:09] just debated him but he said it's man
[1:05:12] that gives him the problem
[1:05:14] but if you can ever surrender that man
[1:05:17] and let god be in control then your life
[1:05:20] even in a fallen flesh even in fallen
[1:05:23] sin the inner man will still try every
[1:05:26] day
[1:05:27] to bring forth the image of his maker
[1:05:31] that's what christianity is all about
[1:05:32] that's what our life in the holy ghost
[1:05:34] is all about that's what the holy ghost
[1:05:36] was given for i know i got weaknesses i
[1:05:38] know you got them we all know we got
[1:05:40] them but every day i rise up and say
[1:05:42] lord today bring me closer to the image
[1:05:48] help me conquer a little more of this
[1:05:50] sinful nature
[1:05:52] that is trapped in my flesh
[1:05:54] i'm trapped
[1:05:56] by it trapped in my flesh
[1:06:00] uh brother bradley give me hebrews 6.
[1:06:04] i want to read that on the overheads
[1:06:06] hebrews 6
[1:06:07] verses 17 and 18.
[1:06:10] so yes we have
[1:06:12] a fallen nature in our flesh
[1:06:15] paul talks about that we seem like i got
[1:06:17] a note for it down here somewhere to
[1:06:18] read a part of a scripture he quotes
[1:06:21] look at this hebrews
[1:06:23] uh
[1:06:24] 6 verse 17 and 18. wherein god
[1:06:27] willing more abundantly to show unto the
[1:06:29] heirs of promise
[1:06:31] the immutability of his councils the the
[1:06:34] uh the unchangeableness of it the
[1:06:36] irreversibleness of it see the
[1:06:39] unstoppableness of it
[1:06:41] so
[1:06:42] wherein god willing he didn't have to do
[1:06:45] it
[1:06:46] willing more abundantly to show unto the
[1:06:50] heirs of promise the immediate
[1:06:52] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[1:06:55] by an oath now stay right there hold on
[1:06:57] he confirmed it by an oath
[1:06:59] now god didn't have to do that because
[1:07:01] he's empirically truthful yeah
[1:07:04] and he has no capacity for falsehood
[1:07:07] but he's dealing with human beings who
[1:07:09] just like to hear somebody say i promise
[1:07:13] even though jesus said let your words be
[1:07:15] yea and nay nay god knew that in our
[1:07:18] weak state we'd just love it if god
[1:07:20] would come down lord i know you're true
[1:07:21] and i know your word is right but could
[1:07:23] you just could you just promise it to me
[1:07:25] and then i know if you promise it then
[1:07:26] you that's a double
[1:07:28] then you'll you'll be doubling it to me
[1:07:30] and so
[1:07:31] paul says god willing he was willing to
[1:07:34] more abundantly assure you and therefore
[1:07:37] he confirmed it by an oath verse 18
[1:07:39] having confirmed it by an oath he says
[1:07:41] that by two
[1:07:43] immutable things first he couldn't lie
[1:07:45] see in which it was impossible for god
[1:07:47] to lie then the second thing is so that
[1:07:50] we might have a strong consolation who
[1:07:52] have fled for refuge to lay up hold upon
[1:07:55] the hope set before us
[1:07:58] now i want you to look at this at this
[1:08:01] line
[1:08:02] who have fled
[1:08:03] for refuge
[1:08:05] to lay
[1:08:06] uh
[1:08:06] we i'm sorry god uh let me start again
[1:08:09] that by two immutable things in which it
[1:08:11] was impossible for god to lie
[1:08:13] watch it we might have a strong
[1:08:16] consolation i want you to know i am part
[1:08:19] of that we yes
[1:08:22] you are part of that we
[1:08:24] you are the one he did this for
[1:08:27] and i i i have fled this world and
[1:08:31] because i realized that there was no
[1:08:33] safety here
[1:08:35] that's what happened to me at the new
[1:08:37] birth i knew there was no safety here i
[1:08:39] realized the world was falling apart and
[1:08:41] beyond that i knew as soon as i was born
[1:08:44] again there was no satisfaction here
[1:08:47] and it became impossible to be satisfied
[1:08:50] so you know what i did i fled it
[1:08:53] as paul said we might have a strong
[1:08:55] constellation who have fled for refuge
[1:08:57] how many have fled for refuge today
[1:09:00] i ran away from my own reasoning i ran
[1:09:04] away from the philosophies of the world
[1:09:06] i knew there was only one place of
[1:09:08] safety
[1:09:10] i knew there was only one place i could
[1:09:12] find the truth the whole truth and
[1:09:13] nothing but the truth
[1:09:21] god looks at everything
[1:09:25] and he sees thank you brother brad he
[1:09:27] sees
[1:09:29] that nothing
[1:09:30] is impossible
[1:09:32] nothing
[1:09:37] now with with humans
[1:09:39] with human beings poor souls
[1:09:43] there's only a very few
[1:09:47] limited things that are even possible
[1:09:50] for us as humans
[1:09:52] a man can walk on the earth
[1:09:55] if he wants to go a little faster he can
[1:09:57] run
[1:09:58] yeah
[1:09:59] if he wants uh you know he can he can
[1:10:02] learn to tread and swim across the top
[1:10:04] of water though it won't naturally
[1:10:06] support his mass or weight
[1:10:10] he he can climb and ascend high
[1:10:12] mountains if he wants to get higher out
[1:10:14] he can jump he can do what he can leap
[1:10:17] see
[1:10:19] but beyond that see now beyond that
[1:10:22] after that he's going to need to build
[1:10:25] something
[1:10:26] because mankind with just 10 fingers and
[1:10:29] 10 toes is very limited on what he can
[1:10:32] do
[1:10:34] with god
[1:10:35] all things are possible
[1:10:37] with a fallen man almost everything is
[1:10:39] impossible
[1:10:41] by comparison to what's available
[1:10:44] see
[1:10:45] and so he'll
[1:10:47] he'll have to if he wants to get across
[1:10:48] water he'll have to do it by raising an
[1:10:50] earth causeway or he might build a
[1:10:52] bridge or finally he'll build a boat or
[1:10:55] a submarine so he can go on top of it or
[1:10:56] go under it what is he trying to do he's
[1:10:58] trying to gain greater mastery of the
[1:11:01] elements that he used to be in control
[1:11:03] of yeah amen jesus still was
[1:11:07] jesus just walked on water he didn't
[1:11:08] cause away a bridge or a boat
[1:11:11] he got into the boat because they were
[1:11:12] all screaming but
[1:11:13] you know and he rebuked the wind and the
[1:11:15] waves he didn't really need to do that
[1:11:16] they needed him to do that he wasn't
[1:11:18] worried about it
[1:11:20] see because with god all things are
[1:11:22] possible
[1:11:24] and he sent his word so that to him that
[1:11:27] believe all things are possible
[1:11:30] now he's turning it to you and me what
[1:11:32] are you going to do with it
[1:11:34] you're going to say well
[1:11:36] okay well okay lord anyway
[1:11:39] no he's trying to get your attention
[1:11:41] to you that'll believe his word
[1:11:44] all things are possible
[1:11:46] not just any because that you know then
[1:11:48] you got to define it but how about i
[1:11:50] give you a definition you don't need to
[1:11:51] define
[1:11:52] oh oh what's outside of all nothing
[1:11:57] amen
[1:11:58] amen so
[1:12:00] we find that the first neither the first
[1:12:02] adam nor the second adam needed any of
[1:12:05] those things if he wants to go faster
[1:12:07] than walking or running
[1:12:09] or go higher then he can jump or climb
[1:12:11] he'll need to build a bike he'll need to
[1:12:13] build a faster motorbike he'll need to
[1:12:15] build a car he'll need to build a plane
[1:12:17] he'll finally need to build a spaceship
[1:12:20] with driven by rocket motors see
[1:12:23] his great power is that he can think
[1:12:26] and he can reason
[1:12:28] and it is conversely also his greatest
[1:12:31] downfall yes amen that he can think and
[1:12:34] that he can reason and so it's his
[1:12:36] greatest strength while at the same time
[1:12:38] remaining his greatest vulnerability
[1:12:41] and so we find that
[1:12:44] that he can calculate to achieve his
[1:12:46] goals but in view listen friends in view
[1:12:50] of controlling
[1:12:52] all the universe
[1:12:54] and all the far outer reaches of space
[1:12:57] and i mean man even with his ingenuity
[1:13:00] is still very very
[1:13:03] limited
[1:13:04] he can't control even the weather
[1:13:07] he can't stop earthquakes
[1:13:09] he can't stop tsunamis all he can do is
[1:13:11] blare a siren and tell everybody to run
[1:13:13] for the hills
[1:13:14] that's his best defense run
[1:13:18] but with god
[1:13:20] all
[1:13:21] things
[1:13:22] are
[1:13:23] possible
[1:13:25] he has no limits
[1:13:27] and israel was warned strictly in the
[1:13:30] bible not to put limits on the god of
[1:13:33] israel
[1:13:34] that is an offense to god when you
[1:13:37] harbor doubt that god will keep a
[1:13:39] promise of his word for you when you are
[1:13:42] when you let symptoms when you let
[1:13:45] circumstances cause you to be afraid i'm
[1:13:47] here to tell you something friends you
[1:13:49] want a god repellent that's one
[1:13:51] yeah
[1:13:52] fear and doubt
[1:13:54] anxiousness nervousness giving in to
[1:13:56] they say well i'm built i'm made that's
[1:13:58] fine but god's got a remedy brother
[1:14:00] brandon was a was a was half irish and
[1:14:02] he had a hot temper but the holy ghost
[1:14:04] controlled that
[1:14:06] don't just back up and say well it's in
[1:14:08] my genes well my mom my dad was like
[1:14:09] this that's no excuse for failing to
[1:14:12] take everything in the word of god into
[1:14:14] your life
[1:14:16] god gives us a choice remember that
[1:14:18] being where all things are possible he's
[1:14:19] trying to say listen you for you all
[1:14:22] things can be possible this is the age
[1:14:24] of perfect faith
[1:14:27] the devil has had very little trouble
[1:14:30] getting
[1:14:31] mankind into the age of perfect fear
[1:14:34] because the slightest thing will scare
[1:14:36] him
[1:14:37] the fear of the unknown is his most
[1:14:38] dreaded fear
[1:14:40] dark room he won't go in without a
[1:14:42] flashlight you know you don't know
[1:14:43] what's there he won't walk in a dark
[1:14:45] area because he don't know is there a
[1:14:46] cliff there i'm going to fall off and
[1:14:47] somebody got a light
[1:14:48] and so
[1:14:49] so with with all of the uncertainty in
[1:14:52] the world satan has been fantastically
[1:14:54] successful
[1:14:55] in getting the age of perfect fear
[1:14:57] and guess what here's the rub you live
[1:15:00] in it
[1:15:01] you're right here just like israel in
[1:15:02] captivity they couldn't do anything
[1:15:03] about the fact that they were in
[1:15:05] captivity with everybody
[1:15:07] and the the babylonians said hey man
[1:15:09] you're down here by the river break out
[1:15:11] your flute and your harps and your liar
[1:15:13] and all these things and sing us some
[1:15:14] happy worship songs like you did back
[1:15:16] there in jerusalem and the children of
[1:15:18] israel said how can we sing
[1:15:20] to our god and worship when we're in
[1:15:22] bondage and we're slaves our hearts are
[1:15:24] broken we're sitting here by the river
[1:15:26] moping
[1:15:27] he won't let us go home we want to go
[1:15:29] home i'm here to tell you something
[1:15:30] friends sometimes as the family of god
[1:15:32] you ever just find yourself sitting with
[1:15:34] your toes in the river of life saying
[1:15:36] lord i just love to go home i just love
[1:15:38] to plunge in i'd love for this to be
[1:15:40] over i'd love to get on with it lord can
[1:15:42] we get on with it how long you going to
[1:15:44] wait well i'm here to tell you he's got
[1:15:45] a plan he's not late he's not behind
[1:15:48] you're still here he's still here he's
[1:15:50] still got a perfection that his bride is
[1:15:52] needing to come to
[1:15:56] and so he has no limits
[1:15:59] now there are some self-imposed
[1:16:01] self-imposed
[1:16:02] uh exceptions that are sealed by an oath
[1:16:06] with no power
[1:16:09] able to bind him
[1:16:11] to anything
[1:16:12] his own righteousness
[1:16:14] binds him to
[1:16:16] the truth
[1:16:17] amen
[1:16:18] that's a self-imposed
[1:16:20] nobody could bind him to that
[1:16:22] but he he binds himself by his own
[1:16:25] righteousness he is bound to always be
[1:16:29] truthful
[1:16:30] the thing completely impossible for him
[1:16:33] to do is to lie
[1:16:36] he cannot
[1:16:37] lie you believe that
[1:16:39] say it with me he cannot lie
[1:16:42] say it again he cannot lie
[1:16:45] it's impossible for him to lie god's
[1:16:47] very nature
[1:16:49] is that he is always good
[1:16:51] and he is always just and he cannot do
[1:16:55] evil so even if calamity
[1:16:58] or judgments that seem uh
[1:17:02] that seem evil from god just know this
[1:17:05] they are always just
[1:17:07] they are always deserved
[1:17:10] god doesn't even allow you
[1:17:12] to
[1:17:13] to decide who needs to get revenge who
[1:17:16] you need to get revenge on
[1:17:18] he even reserves vengeance to himself
[1:17:21] and tells you don't do that don't take
[1:17:23] vengeance because you don't know you
[1:17:25] might be taking vengeance on somebody
[1:17:27] and they don't really deserve it you
[1:17:28] think they do but they really don't
[1:17:30] i'm god is saying i'm the only one who
[1:17:32] really knows who really deserves it so
[1:17:34] just leave that to me
[1:17:36] see
[1:17:37] and so
[1:17:38] we find then that
[1:17:40] he knows who really deserves it he is
[1:17:43] impossibly powerful
[1:17:47] impossibly powerful
[1:17:49] and not merely
[1:17:51] uh possessing unlimited abilities that's
[1:17:53] not what i'm aiming at when i say he's
[1:17:55] impossibly powerful i'm not just talking
[1:17:58] about possessing unlimited abilities for
[1:18:02] for we know that with nobody helping him
[1:18:04] i cover this in another in another part
[1:18:06] of this series with nobody helping him
[1:18:08] and just the spoken word as his only
[1:18:11] tool he literally created everything
[1:18:15] amen
[1:18:16] so so we realize we're not necessarily
[1:18:18] just talking about him being impossibly
[1:18:20] powerful
[1:18:21] not just by merely possessing unlimited
[1:18:24] abilities but but what's even more
[1:18:26] impossible
[1:18:28] is the fact that with all of that
[1:18:30] unlimited power
[1:18:32] he remains perfectly good
[1:18:35] amen
[1:18:37] and that
[1:18:38] that's quite impossible
[1:18:40] for human beings because we know that
[1:18:42] power apart from character will always
[1:18:45] lead to evil deeds and tragic outcomes
[1:18:48] humans have never been able to do that
[1:18:52] they've never been able to have
[1:18:54] unlimited power apart from character and
[1:18:57] have it turn out any good amen come on
[1:19:00] you humans
[1:19:02] look at your neighbor and say you know
[1:19:03] i'm a stinker
[1:19:08] now look back the other way and say oh
[1:19:10] honey i know you are
[1:19:15] amen
[1:19:17] break you up a little bit make you laugh
[1:19:18] you're listening pretty strong
[1:19:23] we are born with a sinful nature
[1:19:26] that makes perfect goodness
[1:19:28] unreachable
[1:19:29] while we are in this fallen flesh even
[1:19:32] with the new birth even with the new
[1:19:33] birth paul tells us in romans 7 18 to
[1:19:36] will is present with me but how to
[1:19:38] perform that which is good i find not i
[1:19:41] know that in me that is in my flesh
[1:19:42] dwelleth no good thing
[1:19:45] see so paul desired to do good he said
[1:19:47] but even when i desire it i still got to
[1:19:49] fight this flesh see showed paul had
[1:19:52] been converted there in that scripture
[1:19:54] because you can't the the the fallen
[1:19:56] mind is enmity against god it can never
[1:19:58] want god's righteousness in a fallen
[1:19:59] condition
[1:20:00] it'll always it'll always
[1:20:02] it'll always go with the way of the of
[1:20:04] the fallen nature and the fallen flesh
[1:20:06] it'll go right along with the world
[1:20:07] it'll know it's a little out of place
[1:20:09] you're like a fish out of water you know
[1:20:11] but still yet you'll go right in and
[1:20:12] just carry right along sometimes for
[1:20:14] years until god gets a hold of your life
[1:20:16] and even when he changes the inside man
[1:20:18] you're still going to battle that
[1:20:19] outside flesh that stinker part of you
[1:20:22] see
[1:20:23] and so i can't be impossibly good it's
[1:20:26] impossible but good news
[1:20:28] he can be
[1:20:30] amen he can be the one that you're
[1:20:33] serving today is impossibly good he is
[1:20:36] impossibly powerful he is all this and
[1:20:39] he's even more than this and you know
[1:20:42] you want you want even you want even
[1:20:44] better news than that
[1:20:46] he offers you
[1:20:48] to live inside you and be a guide and
[1:20:52] take over your life and guide you into
[1:20:54] the path of righteousness
[1:20:56] that's his offer today he offers here is
[1:20:59] this impossibly powerful impossibly good
[1:21:02] perfect being and he's literally
[1:21:04] offering to manage your whole life
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:09] did i bring you the gospel today is that
[1:21:11] good news
[1:21:13] i'm here to tell you according to his
[1:21:14] word this impossibly good and possibly
[1:21:17] powerful god is willing to come in and
[1:21:19] manage your whole life
[1:21:22] if you'll let him amen
[1:21:25] if you'll let him amen
[1:21:27] second peter you don't need don't need
[1:21:29] to turn to it's going to read it quickly
[1:21:30] second peter
[1:21:32] 1 8 and 10 for if these things we read
[1:21:34] this in our last series if these things
[1:21:36] be in you and abound they make you that
[1:21:37] you shall neither be barren or
[1:21:39] unfruitful and therefore he says in
[1:21:40] verse 10 give diligence to make your
[1:21:42] calling and election sure for if you do
[1:21:45] these things ye shall never fall
[1:21:49] what a promise
[1:21:50] so you know i would say and i know this
[1:21:53] is true for me and i'm sure i'm not
[1:21:54] unique in this i'm sure it's true for
[1:21:56] you
[1:21:57] we hate disappointing those we love and
[1:21:59] care about yes amen that's right
[1:22:02] we should have 100 amen on that
[1:22:05] unless you are the most self-centered
[1:22:07] person in the world
[1:22:08] we hate
[1:22:10] disappointing those we love and care
[1:22:13] about we hate it about ourselves you
[1:22:16] know if you've any kind of character
[1:22:18] about you at all you care about those
[1:22:20] you love
[1:22:21] see
[1:22:22] you and and you loathe failing them
[1:22:26] you loathe failing them there's nothing
[1:22:28] that can make you more miserable than to
[1:22:30] fail those you love
[1:22:33] and especially if they suffer a calamity
[1:22:35] or suffer a tragedy at your hands and
[1:22:37] you know it was me i was asleep at the
[1:22:39] switch
[1:22:40] see
[1:22:41] and so imagine
[1:22:43] imagine being a person
[1:22:45] as peter said imagine if you will
[1:22:48] being a person
[1:22:50] who would never fall
[1:22:53] amen overcoming the greatest rub in your
[1:22:56] whole life that you can live in such a
[1:22:58] way that you can always meet the
[1:23:00] expectations of righteousness
[1:23:03] you can always be
[1:23:05] and allow god you can allow god to that
[1:23:08] in that empirical truth that intrinsic
[1:23:11] truth that exists in him it can exist in
[1:23:14] you and you can be a pure
[1:23:17] real authentic
[1:23:19] full of love full of grace full of
[1:23:22] holiness full of righteousness full of
[1:23:24] power full of authority
[1:23:28] you know when when somebody comes to me
[1:23:30] calls me meets me text me whatever
[1:23:32] brother jason pray you know why they do
[1:23:34] that because they have confidence and my
[1:23:36] authority to get a prayer answered amen
[1:23:40] they've seen over the years that god
[1:23:41] answers my prayers and i'm here to tell
[1:23:43] you he answers yours too
[1:23:46] he answers yours too and just just
[1:23:48] realized that god has this purpose for
[1:23:50] all of our lives that we reach a place
[1:23:52] where we stop failure
[1:23:55] in our lives in our homes wouldn't that
[1:23:57] be wonderful friends if in your life and
[1:23:59] your family i don't care what kind of
[1:24:01] chaos it's in now what if today you
[1:24:03] could put a complete arrest and stop on
[1:24:05] all failure and all consequences and all
[1:24:08] miseries and you your family your loved
[1:24:10] ones everyone this whole church could
[1:24:12] rise up in perfect faith and take
[1:24:14] possession of the authority of god
[1:24:19] i'm not preaching a pipe dream i'm
[1:24:21] preaching what's possible in god's word
[1:24:24] see
[1:24:26] impossible you say
[1:24:28] well for you yes but for him
[1:24:31] nothing
[1:24:32] is impossible
[1:24:36] all right i'm gonna
[1:24:37] turn the corner and run for home you got
[1:24:39] 15 minutes
[1:24:45] it's also impossible for god to be
[1:24:47] mocked
[1:24:50] for whatever we sow we reap
[1:24:53] galatians 6 7
[1:24:55] you cannot you say
[1:24:57] what what is whole what if you sow your
[1:24:59] eep that's rather archaic language what
[1:25:01] do you mean what do you mean if i sow
[1:25:02] it's a farmer's language yeah see
[1:25:05] it you cannot plant
[1:25:08] seed
[1:25:09] in the garden of life
[1:25:11] and fail to grow a crop
[1:25:13] because you put seed in the ground it'll
[1:25:14] grow
[1:25:15] you understand
[1:25:17] it's it's the imperishable seed the
[1:25:19] gospel is the is the imperishable seed
[1:25:21] and that's why he says listen stop stop
[1:25:23] letting the devil put seeds of doubt and
[1:25:25] seeds of discrepancy and you stop
[1:25:28] allowing it in your life in your home
[1:25:30] you have the power to cut off seeds of
[1:25:33] discrepancy and start sowing the
[1:25:35] imperishable seed in your home and you
[1:25:38] know what you'll see you'll see a crop
[1:25:39] start growing in your children and in
[1:25:41] your marriage and in your finances and
[1:25:42] in your in your social activities your
[1:25:44] friendships and you'll find the glory of
[1:25:46] god coming down beaming through out of
[1:25:49] you to those you love and you'll be a
[1:25:51] benefit
[1:25:52] [Applause]
[1:25:54] of a hindrance
[1:25:56] you cannot sow and fail to reap and you
[1:25:58] cannot sow a crop of sin hear me young
[1:26:01] people particularly you just came out of
[1:26:02] camp
[1:26:04] you know i hope you know here's
[1:26:06] something i hope that all you teenagers
[1:26:09] saw i'm sure you saw many things at camp
[1:26:12] i hope this didn't escape you
[1:26:15] you're not in this alone
[1:26:18] you set among
[1:26:20] hundreds of other like-minded young men
[1:26:24] and young women from all over
[1:26:27] and and i can tell you what if we had
[1:26:29] the capacity we could have probably
[1:26:31] filled that camp up with a thousand of
[1:26:33] you
[1:26:34] and the message that you should get is i
[1:26:36] am not alone
[1:26:38] and i'm not gonna let the devil keep
[1:26:40] lying to me that i'm all alone you're
[1:26:43] not alone
[1:26:44] god has young men and young women around
[1:26:47] the world who lift up holy hands
[1:26:52] see amen
[1:26:53] that's why we're going to do more of it
[1:26:55] we're going to do that again we're going
[1:26:56] to do more than that again see
[1:26:58] because we care about you and so
[1:27:01] hear me when i say
[1:27:02] that you cannot sow a crop of sin
[1:27:05] and fail to take in the awful
[1:27:07] consequences that is impossible
[1:27:10] that is completely impossible
[1:27:13] you will most certainly reap what you
[1:27:16] sow
[1:27:17] later than you sow
[1:27:18] right
[1:27:19] but more than you sow
[1:27:23] you get that
[1:27:24] whatever you sow you'll reap now you'll
[1:27:26] reap it later but when you reap it it'll
[1:27:28] be more than you sowed you'll go my
[1:27:29] goodness what i did wasn't even that bad
[1:27:31] how is it like 10 times worse
[1:27:33] because that's the law
[1:27:35] of nature
[1:27:36] you sow one grain and you grow a whole
[1:27:39] ear of corn with all kinds of grains
[1:27:40] hundreds of grains from that one
[1:27:42] see
[1:27:44] and so you saw a few apple seeds look
[1:27:46] how many apples you grow when you grow
[1:27:48] that tree how many limbs it has how many
[1:27:51] branches it has look how much fruit it
[1:27:52] produces and all came from just a couple
[1:27:54] of seed you put in the earth and it
[1:27:55] followed god's laws
[1:27:58] see luke 17
[1:28:01] 6 brother brad give me that one we'll
[1:28:02] read this one together and then we'll
[1:28:04] hit jeremiah 32 and read that one
[1:28:05] together
[1:28:07] luke 17 6 i've got 10 minutes
[1:28:10] help me lord
[1:28:12] all right and the lord said
[1:28:15] saint luke chapter 17 verse 6
[1:28:18] and the lord said if ye had faith as a
[1:28:21] grain of mustard seed you might say unto
[1:28:24] the sycamore tree be thou plucked up by
[1:28:26] the root and be thou planted in the sea
[1:28:29] and it should obey you amen and another
[1:28:32] place he talks about doing that to a
[1:28:34] mountain
[1:28:36] a
[1:28:36] mountain
[1:28:38] see you'd say to that mountain that's in
[1:28:40] your way
[1:28:41] from serving god and many of us have big
[1:28:44] old mountains and they've been there a
[1:28:46] long time
[1:28:47] but jesus said if you have perfect faith
[1:28:49] just as a no bigger than a grain of
[1:28:51] mustard seed you could actually speak to
[1:28:53] that mountain and god would move it
[1:28:56] amen jeremiah 32 17
[1:29:00] ah lord god
[1:29:03] i behold
[1:29:04] that thou hast made the heaven and the
[1:29:07] earth by thy great power and stretched
[1:29:10] out arm and there is nothing too hard
[1:29:15] for thee
[1:29:16] this is jeremiah's understanding look at
[1:29:18] it again lord behold thou hast made the
[1:29:21] heaven and the earth by thy great power
[1:29:24] and stretched out arm and there is
[1:29:26] nothing too hard for thee
[1:29:30] so when you you know when you go and
[1:29:32] read we won't turn to it
[1:29:34] but when you go and read the faith
[1:29:36] chapter we call it the faith chapter
[1:29:37] hebrews 11 by faith by faith by faith
[1:29:40] this one did this one did this one you
[1:29:42] can be left
[1:29:44] astonished
[1:29:45] reading that at just how powerful god is
[1:29:48] you go home today and take a fresh read
[1:29:49] of the 11th chapter of hebrews it is it
[1:29:52] is one of the most supernatural
[1:29:54] testimonies of the supernatural you're
[1:29:56] ever going to read
[1:29:57] no you you stack up a thousand comic
[1:29:59] books you'd never find a superhero with
[1:30:01] that kind of power
[1:30:03] of what some of these people pulled off
[1:30:06] it is it is incredible when you read
[1:30:08] that 11th chapter of hebrews but it's
[1:30:11] not your power
[1:30:14] it wasn't their power doing it it was
[1:30:17] god's power that is revealed or
[1:30:20] manifested or uncorked in you
[1:30:23] it's god's faith it's his revealed faith
[1:30:27] working in his family
[1:30:30] he's got a he's got an entire six 000
[1:30:33] years of superheroes he can tell you
[1:30:35] about
[1:30:36] see
[1:30:37] now give me my powerpoint brothers if we
[1:30:39] can have the powerpoint that'd be
[1:30:40] awesome

[1:30:57] no
[1:30:58] defeat
[1:31:00] how many say amen
[1:31:02] faith knows no defeat
[1:31:05] faith is perfect
[1:31:07] faith brings things
[1:31:09] when there is no things to be brought
[1:31:13] amen is that pretty
[1:31:14] powerful oh i i i i i know you're
[1:31:17] hearing me read it do we got it guys get
[1:31:19] in you're going to get that up for me
[1:31:21] okay
[1:31:22] where is it
[1:31:23] it was in the one drive lobby i sent
[1:31:25] several messages indicating it this
[1:31:27] morning yeah
[1:31:29] and never mind i don't have enough time
[1:31:31] i've already promised everybody i'd be

[1:31:39] faith knows i'm gonna start again faith
[1:31:41] knows no defeat faith is perfect
[1:31:46] faith brings things when there is no
[1:31:48] things to be brought
[1:31:50] faith creates
[1:31:52] you believe a prophet
[1:31:55] faith takes doubt away takes negative
[1:31:58] and makes positive how beautiful
[1:32:00] the old man
[1:32:01] he says had a basis for faith he's
[1:32:03] talking about the the man that that had
[1:32:06] seen god he said so faith is not
[1:32:08] mythical
[1:32:09] something mentally worked up it's an
[1:32:12] absolutely fundamental result that
[1:32:15] happens in a person's heart
[1:32:18] when faith is appropriated
[1:32:21] then it is something in the person's
[1:32:22] heart but it can't be based on say well
[1:32:26] oh go touch a tree and you'll get well
[1:32:28] or pray to a post it's got to have a
[1:32:30] foundation
[1:32:31] amen it's got to have a foundation if
[1:32:33] you can if you can get down to to to
[1:32:36] like the 10th 10th one maybe
[1:32:38] 10th frame
[1:32:40] yeah yeah tenth frame
[1:32:42] when faith is appropriated do i have it
[1:32:45] controlled here
[1:32:46] let me see if i can go backwards
[1:32:49] okay no worries you can do it for me
[1:32:51] let's read this again when faith is
[1:32:53] appropriated then it is something in the
[1:32:55] person's heart but it can be based on
[1:32:57] say well go out and touch a tree and get
[1:32:59] well pray to post it's got to have a
[1:33:00] foundation now watch next next slide
[1:33:03] now here it is i want you to get it
[1:33:06] how
[1:33:07] much more foundation could you place
[1:33:10] your faith on any level than the word of
[1:33:13] god what more could you put faith in
[1:33:16] when he said heavens and earth will pass
[1:33:18] away but my word will never pass away
[1:33:20] this is the being who created everything
[1:33:22] remember and the only tool he had was
[1:33:24] his word all right watch
[1:33:26] then it is a fact
[1:33:29] then it is a fact that god's word is
[1:33:32] eternal
[1:33:33] and the very world that we're sitting on
[1:33:36] top of tonight is nothing more than the
[1:33:40] word of god materialized he spoke the
[1:33:43] word and said let there be
[1:33:44] and the world came into existence all
[1:33:47] things that you see was made by faith in
[1:33:50] the spoken word of god god said
[1:33:53] let there be
[1:33:54] and he believed his own word well
[1:33:57] after redemption and a taste of god in
[1:34:00] our souls and heart how much more ought
[1:34:02] we to base our faith on what god gave us
[1:34:05] the promise for and sent jesus to die to
[1:34:09] redeem us to that promise
[1:34:11] that's what calvary was done for to
[1:34:13] redeem you to the promise any time that
[1:34:16] god is taken say any time
[1:34:19] louder any time
[1:34:22] any time that god is taken at his word
[1:34:24] on those bases
[1:34:26] it's going to bring the result that god
[1:34:29] said it would bring hallelujah
[1:34:32] amen see
[1:34:34] so you said you know you
[1:34:37] jesus said that you could actually say
[1:34:40] to a tree or say to a mountain be
[1:34:43] removed and cast into the sea jesus said
[1:34:46] that you can operate a faith that would
[1:34:49] literally move that mountain out of your
[1:34:51] way you say oh brother jason you you you
[1:34:55] my mountain is big and i've had it for a

[1:41:04] he touched things also that represented
[1:41:06] hope i've i've often looked at that
[1:41:08] longingly wishing oh if that could just
[1:41:10] be me
[1:41:11] if i could just have that kind of life
[1:41:13] lord i trust today
[1:41:15] that the holy ghost preaching has driven
[1:41:17] back spirits of unbelief and allowed the
[1:41:20] holy ghost to say to that child yes you
[1:41:22] can
[1:41:23] you can be that child you can oh it's
[1:41:27] not hard i'll do it all you've got to do

[1:41:49] the other side you'll sit down under a
[1:41:51] tree as the prophet said and the and and
[1:41:53] the and you'll you'll think about the
[1:41:55] things you went through here and the
[1:41:57] prophet said you just laugh
[1:41:59] said when you cross over the first
[1:42:01] thought that will go through your mind
[1:42:03] is
[1:42:03] why was i ever worried
[1:42:06] lord i pray that you will now anoint
[1:42:09] hearts today to reach up and believe
[1:42:11] reach reach those people lord they might
[1:42:13] not have a mountain in front of them
[1:42:14] lord they might have a mountain setting
[1:42:16] on top of them
[1:42:18] they might feel under the weight of a
[1:42:20] mountain they might feel it's impossible
[1:42:22] to go forward it's too far it's too much
[1:42:25] damage that's what moses thought
[1:42:27] that's exactly what he thought brother
[1:42:28] branham said he's 80 years old
[1:42:31] he's standing there in the wilderness
[1:42:33] one day
[1:42:34] attending another man's sheep that
[1:42:36] weren't even his
[1:42:38] he's just been reduced from a prince to
[1:42:40] a
[1:42:41] shepherd with a staff guiding another
[1:42:43] man's sheep
[1:42:46] he started thinking about his life
[1:42:47] brother branham said
[1:42:50] he said he thought about all of his
[1:42:52] failures and
[1:42:53] thought about all the years that he had
[1:42:55] wasted and he said well
[1:42:57] it's too late now
[1:42:59] i'm old and i've
[1:43:00] missed my opportunity and brother
[1:43:02] branham said
[1:43:03] the great crystal tears
[1:43:05] flowed down his face and across his
[1:43:07] beard
[1:43:08] and he said it's right then that he
[1:43:10] heard the sound of a cracking flame
[1:43:13] and he looked and he saw a mysterious
[1:43:15] thing
[1:43:16] oh god help us today lord i don't care
[1:43:18] where we are young or old
[1:43:20] may we hear the sound of the cracking
[1:43:22] flame today lord may we turn aside and
[1:43:25] say i must go and see this amazing sight
[1:43:28] it was god calling him even after all
[1:43:30] those years of what he thought was
[1:43:32] wasted years it wasn't god needed every
[1:43:35] one of them moses would need everything
[1:43:37] he learned
[1:43:38] in the first 40 years and everything he
[1:43:40] learned in the second 40 years to
[1:43:42] accomplish his third 40 years
[1:43:45] he needed to be twice as prepared as the
[1:43:48] duty in front of him
[1:43:50] i pray you will help us today lord god
[1:43:52] to be prepared this is a wicked day it's
[1:43:54] a wicked age
[1:43:55] it's over spreading the world there's
[1:43:58] fear and anxiety everywhere lord god
[1:44:00] people running crazy

[1:44:04] off of hell demon power streaming in the
[1:44:07] earth what a unique hour
