========================================

e e e e e for e e e buildings and what looks to be like some kind of tower in the background um I don't know Josh if you have that PowerPoint um it's coming up right now but this this has to do with how close that he is to the tree and the type of lens that he was using but what's so striking to me is that as he gets closer to the tree the further away the background structures gets and you know there's several factors involving photography here that we that we won't get into this morning with field of view and subject distance and just some mathematical stuff but the main focus and the entire premise of this was that this artist or this photographer wrote a whole lesson on what he did here and he summed it up into what he what he called a one sentence takeaway and it was this as we widen our focal length and move closer to main subject the background elements in our scene will appear smaller do you have it brother as we widen I want to read that one more time as we widen our focal length and move closer to our main subject the background elements in our scene will appear smaller now spiritually this morning if we we um as we widen our Focus uh our heavenly father will broaden our perspective of his word in our life as he grows us and as he matures us as he takes us through things you know we're continuing to advance forward we're pressing towards our Mark and we widen our focal length you know and just think it on on a spiritual uh spiritual thinking field this morning you know and as those background elements in our scene smaller and smaller you know and I just I want this concept to to get into our hearts this morning I felt like it was just it was so encouraging when I saw this and I studing this as we move towards and progress through this life sometimes it doesn't feel like much has happening amen sometimes you feel maybe like you're not growing spiritually sometimes you you might feel like you're not pressing towards the mark you might you might not feel it all the way amen but you know there is growth happening and does anybody else ever feel like that amen and somehow you know you are Josh man okay amen so anyway um it just doesn't feel like much is happening but something is happening in your life amen something is taking place and I don't have the images but I want to just try to draw the picture in your mind this tree there's a tree and it's as you as he moves closer to the tree the tree doesn't look any bigger because the uh the lens that the photographer is using is a different lens right so the tree actually looks like it's the same size but then you move there's four different images as you move closer to the next image he's actually 50 feet closer and then as you move NE the next image he's over 100 feet closer by the time that he gets to the final image he's over 400t closer to where he was when he started now the tree looks the same size because he widened his array he widened his lens but all that stuff in the background is so much further away it begins to just lose itself in the Horizon and we're going to get into that this morning as you as you broaden your perspective in the word it may not always feel like you're growing and it may not always look like you're growing but as long as you're pressing towards the mark As long as you're keeping these statutes then sometimes you just need to take a step back a reflection sometimes is important sometimes you need to look back and you say wow that used to trouble me but it doesn't trouble me anymore those things used to hinder my walk but those things don't hinder my walk anymore you know and all of those things it may not look like you're getting closer but you're closer cuz God says that you press towards the mark amen and as we begin to mature in our Christian walk God is giving us more and more These Are Spiritual Stepping Stones the These Are Spiritual building blocks that that we that that we pressing forward and eventually all of those things in the background and I have just you know all those trials and all those hardships and all those difficulties and all those doubts it it's just getting further and further away and eventually it's just going to it's just going to dissipate into the background amen all that all that doubt you know and sometimes just to think of it this morning say sometimes you can't notice those things those burdens that you once carried until you look back and you're able to see all the ground that you really have gained amen sometimes you just need to take a step you know you feel what the enemy does in our minds is he gets us he gets us so so narrow-minded into what's happening right now in your day right in in this day in this time and in this moment but the Lord is progressing you amen he is if you're still here if you're still in church if you have a desire this morning then he's still progressing you sometimes he just wants you to look back and say look remember when you once struggled with that or remember when you once had a question about that or remember when you went through this circumstance and I allowed that circumstance but now you're past it and now you've matured in it and now you've matured in the word so sometimes those moments of of reflection are are important and amen you know you are gaining ground towards Victory amen and all those all those past defeats cuz sometimes sometimes those things in the background are defeats we do have defeats we do have failures we do have faults anyone who thinks that they don't is is wrong you have faults and you have failures and you have times where you slip up but those things are also what get pushed out into the background because you know it's not about the mistake that you made it's about what you did after you made the mistake it's about it's about how you got back up from that thing amen you know and I believe we've probably don't worry about those pictures um I believe we've probably all heard brother Ben talk about this picture he saw it's called this Cloudland image um you know and then there was an image an artist painted called the Cloudland and and he talks about it several times and and he describes how it was a German painter that painted it and you know when you look at the picture from a distance it's just it's completely Mis misunderstood I'm sure we've all heard about this before and brother brandham said when he viewed the image um from far away it was and these were his words it was the horriblest looking Gloom that he's ever seen But as he got closer to the image he realized it was actually this beautiful portrayal of these angels beating their you know beating their wings together and it struck me because as I was as I began thinking about this and example after example of how often times we can see something from a far off and completely Mis misunderstand it you know sometimes sometimes when you're seeing something from a distance it can be misunderstood you know the the human eye is only limited to see so far even if you have perfect vision it can only see things clearly within a few hundred feet and of course there are exceptions to that you know of course you know there's this excerpt I got from a quick search on it that the concept of line of sight is crucial when considering how far we can see this doesn't just mean removing obstacles from your line of sight you need to think about the curvature of the Earth itself when you're considering maximum distances and on a clear Day St standing at sea level The Horizon is typically about 3 mil away or so which is usually the maximum limit you can see however this changes drastically depending on your elevation now that's an important statement for instance from the top of Mount Everest on a clear day The Horizon would be visible at a distance of about 230 miles however think back to the stars and the moon there there's no Horizon blocking your view so you can see objects that are millions or even billions of miles away you know so the Horizon and I want this to this is spiritually to think about this The Horizon plays an important part in your maximum visual range The Horizon amen the Sun the setting of The Sun you remember how brother brandom in 1965 would say sometimes we just need to we just need to let the sun just come and ripen us ripen the word into our hearts and let the let the word just come and soak in the seed has been planted now the sun has to come and ripen that seed so it can grow out of us amen and sometimes we can see objects but until we get close enough to the object we may not be able to fully identify what it is or what its meaning or its value is amen and the same thing goes on the other side of this you know we often times can can look at things going on spiritually or just naturally in our lives but it's not until you get on the other side of it that you're able to fully understand it or to fully appreciate it amen you know and and just like that just like that definition in visual Acuity there that I was given you know sometimes God needs to elevate you a little bit higher to get a longer Range View of what's going on Amen and that's important that's the the elevation of of some of the things that we go into in our lives you know the the trials of course but it's not just that it's it's the the testings it's the it's the all of the all of the above you put it in there that's how God mat ures you and grows you trials are in there of course but he does it in other ways as well and and I love how they put that cuz it had a lot to do with the Horizon amen and a lot of it has to do with light and how much light is included in what you're looking at and um sometimes you know you may not see just exactly what it is doing especially when it when it's happening what it's doing to help you grow until a little bit further in the future but but nevertheless God knew from the beginning that it was going to be beautiful amen and Ecclesiastes 3 I love that I love that scripture God hath made beautiful God hath made everything beautiful in whose time in his time amen his time is unlimited it's unimaginable so it it happens and sometimes it doesn't happen in our time sometimes I wish it did but it doesn't it happens in his time but he does make everything beautiful amen and I I began to think about this subject with relation to distance and and and I thought about how sometimes we can analyze situations from a distance you know and just to kind of pivot a little bit here you know sometimes we can hear some type of of of gossip about a certain person or maybe hear what they said or what they did and then we begin to have a misconception some conceptions about the person and often times it's a misconception about those people or about those situations and what can happen and this this happens to all of us because we're all human is we look at a s a situation from the distance and we see exactly what brother bam saw what an awful mess it is just like this picture it may be the most horribl sight you ever look at but if we can start applying what the scripture says here and um you know and this isn't in every in every situation you know we have to have mature Minds when we think about this but we esteem your brothers higher than than yourself the Bible teaches us that esteem your brothers higher they're going through something we esteem them higher don't think ill of them even if they made a mistake look around at your brothers and sisters this morning cuz they're going to make mistakes you they's going to they're going to say something they're going to do something it's just going to happen that's we're human we're human beings we're in this flesh so it's going to happen but if we can if we can quickly as well as this is this is something that I felt like the Lord just you know has had me go through on this just studying for this you know we have an advocate on the throne amen we have an intercessor he's the high priest of our profession amen and he's still on that throne interceding and all we have to do is what we have to repent of those things and that's that's a thing that happens on a daily basis you know we're not we're not you know living in sinless bodies yet you know we're of course once we have our new nature we live above those things but we still sometimes will fall and we'll still sometimes make mistakes and that's why he's still sitting on the throne amen but what we have to do is repent and him who is faithful and these are scriptures now will forgive and that's the model that we're supposed to follow amen we're supposed to follow Jesus's model on that if we apply those scriptural Concepts I believe we we we we'll start you know and we'll all start seeing and not that we haven't but just reapplying sometimes I was just listening to pet the other Peter the other day this is just to bring back to remembrance amen we all know these things but we ought to bring it back to our remembrance we'll start seeing the beauty of the image a whole lot more in our lives and in the lives of our brothers and sisters you know like I said your brother or your sister next to you today sitting on these pews they're going to mess up maybe they're going to say something or do something that isn't always right but I believe that we can reach a point in maturity where we can move past those things and quickly at that amen forgive 70 time seven turn the other cheek and don't you know don't hold grudges against people um I I this is this is actually from the Mayo Clinic this is their organization's website so it's medically accredited amen and I got these statements directly from Mayo Clinic forgiveness can lead to healthier relationships improve mental health less anxiety stress hostility fewer symptoms of depression lower blood blood pressure a stronger immune system improved heart health and improved self-esteem amen amen God knew this before any doctor ever knew this before they had to go through studies before they had to go through years and years of analysis God knew this so he put in his word forgive amen forgive 70 time 7 you know he might mess up he might do the same exact thing that he did last week or the the week before forgive and I know sometimes it's difficult but sometimes God just wants us to grow and and be mature in those things and and and know that it's not it's not about us it's about the the grander picture amen that's why we have to let stuff go in our lives and and we got to arise above that thing because if you're not careful you know it can Can it can also lead to serious you know it talks about physical health but it can also lead to Serious hindrances in your spiritual growth as well amen you know do you think that Jesus would be pleased knowing that we're holding something against somebody you know or um you know when when he forgave me of stuff probably 10 times worse than whatever it is that this person did amen amen amen the Bible says if you have a quarrel against a brother approach that person amen scripture and listen to the Lord's instruction on this Matthew 18 He says moreover if any brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if she if he shall hear thee thou Hast gained a brother but if he will not hear thee then take three uh take with thee one or two more that is in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word may be established and if he neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen man as a publican and how often now there's three steps there that that Jesus gives and how often do people skip step one and they go right to step two or to step three they go and tell their brothers or their friends in the church or or maybe they even turn it into gossip you know and one thing I know for sure amen and I don't know I'm not thinking of anybody specifically with this I hope nobody thinks that I had nobody in mind I have no idea about anybody doing any gossip I just want to go ahead and get that out there I don't know why the Lord wanted me to say this this morning but one thing I know for sure is there is not going to be any gossip in heaven amen there are going to be there are going to be brothers and sisters living in unity amen we are to we are to be of one mind and of one Accord amen that is how they were able to break through in the upper room that is how they were able to break through and and get to the place that God wanted them to get to they were in one mind and one Accord every place in the scripture where there was in one mind and one Accord there's something happen supernaturally spiritually incredible amen and even on the other side of things and I I think brother Jason had made this statement years ago even when they were in one in mind in one Accord there's something about that they did that at the Tower of Babel and God had to change their language amen because there's something about it when Humans Beings get together in one mind in one Accord um and I believe that that's the way that the Lord wants us to live now amen Ephesians 4:13 says till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man under the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen that's the maturity that he wants us to attain in these bodies amen a unity in the faith Even in our differences amen Even in our differences giving respect one to another he goes on to say that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of man and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up in all things which is the the head even Christ from whom the whole body jointly are fit fitly joined together and compacted excuse me by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working and measure of every part maketh increase of the body and the edifying of itself in love Ephesians 4 so growing up in all things a port maturing amen if he goes on to say in 20 verse 22 that ye put off the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed Amen in the spirit of your mind that you put on a new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness wherefore putting away lying and speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another amen we are members one of another and let all bitterness and wrath and anger and evil speaking be put away with you amen that be kind one to another uh uh I'm sorry with all malice and be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you amen all that bitterness and all that evil speaking to be put away and that means that any attitudes or any bitterness to or any ill thought towards a brother or sister the Bible commands us we have to forgive those things amen and that's that's what I that's what we're striving for that the scripture says to be truly tenderhearted towards each other that that's what's going to give your brother or sister maybe the Boost that they need when they're when they're when they're down amen usually you know when when I know when I make a mistake we beat ourselves up worse than anybody else would amen we're Our Own Worst uh enemy which is good you know we have to be that way we have to make sure that we keep ourselves in check when we we may make a mistake but I know that when I'm in a situation like that you know I beat myself up and to hear a word of encouragement especially from maybe the person that that I I wronged or or whatever the situation is to get that kind of a boost it it it's It's Supernatural amen that's God in you that's God working through you amen hope this is all right this morning um just felt like the Lord wanted me to go this way so um and Josh did you end up getting that or no okay getting back to distance this morning sometimes we know when we're looking at things from a distance like the cloud image um that the prophet was speaking about it does look gloomy you know and it looks dark and we talked about uh in the previous two or three lessons we talked about Paul and his trial that he was facing and how the things that we go through how often times it can look dark and often seems like it's a horrible sight but if you can just take a few steps closer and maybe shed some light on the image uh it can change the whole Viewpoint of it and and all the background shatter just like that example we gave um for those who weren't in here that you know that image you know as you as he got closer to the tree you know several hundred feet closer to the tree there was the tree from the uh image itself looked about the same height and but all of the stuff in the background got it was almost as if you couldn't even see it anymore and that was because he widened his angle he he put a different lens on the camera and that's what we are to do amen sometimes you need you're moving closer to the mark you need to watch your angle you need to allow the Lord to bring you into a mature place to see because then you'll know because all it may not feel like it but you'll know because all that stuff in the distance is it's just fading away amen those the the the background the hardships that we face you know it just gets further and further into the distance and eventually just disappears and um I think I made this point here some time ago but you know all those hardships and mind battles and disappointments one day they're going to vanish away forever amen and it's and it's all going to be left we're all going to be into the in the Glorious future that God has prepared for us amen and what was once this picture of Doom and Gloom now has become these angel wings beating together in that Cloudland image that brother renom was talking about amen um there's that scripture I think this is just the last few statements here uh in just in just a short time the Bible says you know and we know this that your mourning will be turned into laughter Ecclesiastes 3 and I wanted to just end on some of these scriptures here what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he labor I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he hath set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end and I thought what an interesting thing the travail that God hath given to the sons of men to what to be exercised in it amen he has given us these things to be exercised in it to exercise our faith as Sons and Daughters of God to grow us uh in maturity to to get us to see things from a different perspective a Heavenly perspective amen and I I want these scriptures to be not just something I read I want them to be reality in my life amen right amen I think sometimes that that we can preach on on Trials or things we face you know uh I was just going to say me sometimes we've not to single anybody out but I'll just you know we're not talking about anybody here but we make it seem like maybe what you're going through in life is going to be this constant wave of incredible trial and pain and suffering but Saints it's not always like that amen granted you will have hardships the Bible teaches that we're going to have trials and you know acts 14 we must through many tribulation enter the kingdom of God and the trials and the tests they prove our faith first Peter teaches us that and we will face difficult situations and difficult things but as Believers we can't view our life as this long bumpy road of Gloom all the time amen if we live in a place where our constant thought process is the trials that you faced or the things that even that you're currently going through you're going to find yourself living in a place of Gloom you know when and I I think I was listening to brother darl Ward this Wednesday and he was talking about you know just the symptoms you know when you start getting when you start focusing on the symptoms and he's talking about what brother rham said with with Jonah and he's looking he's got symptoms he's the worst worst symptomatic person you've ever seen he's got symptoms on every side sometimes when you get focused on the symptoms or what what you're facing currently or the Mind battles then you're going to get locked up into that place and I know I'm guilty of that a lot you get locked up into that place but what you start to do is you start to focus on something else amen you start to allow the the presence of the Lord to come in and um you know look at look at yourself and and just say Lord where is it that where is it that I can be other than where I'm at right now amen I want to I want to grow from this I don't want to be in this place anymore and God has a provided time of healing for you he's already done it but he knows when it will manifest in your life so we're not to focus on that we're to focus on how we're going to grow from it we're we're to focus on how how can we not focus on the symptoms amen and when those Believers there in Acts they went through those hardships and they were and they were beaten and tortured and they went through the worst things any of us have ever had to face amen they went through much worse things look at their attitude amen they counted it a joy because of many of them had watched physically watched Jesus suffer and die on a cross for them and we just have to put into perspective sometimes how blessed we are are you know in the family that you're in in the word that you hear in the message you've been brought and don't don't let yourselves become uh and I thought about myself on this because it can happen to any of us don't let yourself become this spiritual pessimist where you're always focused on your hardships or your pains or your mind battles of the negatives amen the
