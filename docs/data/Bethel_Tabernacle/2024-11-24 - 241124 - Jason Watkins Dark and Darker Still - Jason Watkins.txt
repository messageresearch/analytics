this morning amen let's give Sister Sister Deborah A [Applause] handen S makes more nervous but I want to say a little something um this song is really special to me because it it came to me during a Time of very deep spiritual dryness and I didn't realize when inspiration struck for it that it was actually somewhere deep within me a prayer that was searching to grow and I I didn't fully understand what I was asking when I wrote this song and that a lot of times when you want to grow spiritually it means you're going to go through a lot of hard trials but it this song was kind of the beginning of a chain of events that caused a lot of growth in my life and I'm so thankful that the Lord inspired it because at the time I didn't even really fully know what the words meant I just I thought oh what a nice song and I'll sing it and I know some some people seem to be blessed by it but I didn't fully realize and now looking back on it I'm just so grateful that the Lord not only inspired this song for me but that he created the growth in my in my life that I desperately wanted even though I didn't know that I wanted it so I hope it's a blessing to you and I know you all know it at this point so you can sing it along with me so I won't be as [Music] nervous I love you for what you are doing in me although I am not yet what I need to be for in my mind I often find there's too much of me I pray you take it [Music] away and then you'd stay where I used to be I love you for what you are doing in [Music] me although I am not yet what I need to be for in my mind I often find there's too much of me I pray youd take it away and then you'd stay where I used to be I've [Music] fallen so far that I've broken my own heart again but you've seen the things I've done and what I have become but you're the one who made me out of dust so make me one more time and when you look at me I want to [Music] be what you had in mind oh I love you for what you are doing in me allthough I am not yet what I need to be for in my mind I often find there's too much left of me I pray you take it away and then you'd stay where I used to be [Music] I surrender all I [Music] surrender

morning happy to be in the house of God on beautiful sunny Sunday morning amen praise the Lord happy to have our visitors with us here this morning and different ones God bless you happy to have you all amen want to remember um I think brother JD is preaching for brother Joe this morning if I'm remembering correctly Brother Brad is also way ministering so want to be holding up those members of our team who are out ministering amen praise the Lord Brother Luther good to see you standing on two feet bro amen devil to afflict him Amen in his knee but uh Prayer Changes Everything doesn't it amen praise the Lord Amen brother the mark good to have you guys back home safe and sound home back safe and sound amen praise the Lord I want to um uh have a special request this morning uh brother Michael Gonzalez reached out to me to say that his dad um is right near crossing over I think they've given him 24 hours to live and so naturally as any son of the Kingdom he you know has a concern for his father amen and so uh we we joined me in prayer today for that request I know that the Lord will move mightily Amen brother Virgil good to see you today praise the Lord amen let's turn in our Bibles to Acts chapter 26 while you're turning to Acts 26 I'd like to say that um so this might shock you but we're going to um stand down from the service in the midweek it's Thanksgiving weekend and I've never done that I've always uh held service on Tuesday but um we have a rather unique Dynamic here at at bethl Tabernacle that most of this church is imported and uh very very very few native bonian and that that's the way it goes um you know it's little Seaside Town you're not really I mean if you're going to come to Buford you got to come to Buford you're not really going through you're not going anywhere through Buford amen you're either coming here or you're not so you got to kind of come off of the beaten Trail come down near the ocean and you'll be right here with us amen and so um so it it kind of works out that way the Lord has brought us in they come from the East and West amen they come from the lands ofar to Feast with the King to dine as his guest how blessed these pilgrims are amen so we're happy to have you all here today amen Mo you're sitting in the wrong spot I was looking for you over here amen but remember what Brother Don told us years ago this a Yankee Stadium we don't have a sign seating except for sister Jean do not get her I will get a phone call do not get her Amen brother Luther knows to hold on to her seat her problem is she's she's so short that she can't see good so she has to have that spot amen man and so and I think she just likes to look at me so praise the Lord so we're happy to to have that amen praise God Amen so amen amen praise the Lord so um so normally I haven't done that but so many families are traveling uh to see family and I just thought to myself you know uh can I say this to you why don't you make sure that you purpose in your heart right now to say you know I'm going to have have a midweek service with my family at Thanksgiving where we're going to gather and we're going to be thankful not just a holiday right right thank that's not Thanksgiving wasn't in in you know done for that it had nothing to do with who was playing football amen it had everything to do with the early American fathers being grateful that God had spared them amen and and was helping them so we want to take this week and be with your families make it a family affair gather your family around you and amen and just be grateful for all that God has done praise the Lord will you do it all right praise the Lord then I'll feel proper uh laying aside the midweek service so that you can have your own amen God bless you let's read Acts chapter 26 Michael I guess you don't have an update since you reached out to me for your dad okay all right all right uh acts 2612 to8 we're we're continuing today and um I had a brother reach out to me who uh brother Mark coffee who transcribes all of my sermons and especially my series it's super helpful to me uh when I'm in a especially a lengthy Series so I can go back so I don't you know cover things we've already covered sometimes you can you'd be surprised you it's hard to remember exactly okay did I cover this did I cover that and I preach all the time and so sometimes I don't remember where I said what when uh so it's very helpful so he wrote to me he said now how do you want to do this he said because I've never I've never as far as I know I've never in all my Ministry had the Lord dropped three sermons on me with three different titles and I actually announced them all in advance I've never done that usually I say I've got a little series two or three parts and it ends up being eight or nine but I've never thought okay I'm going to start three separate thoughts so they are I guess uh they do definitely go together we spoke last time uh a sermon titled into the darkness and to today we want to carry on and I want to take the title dark and darker still amen acts 262 12 to 18 whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priest at midday O King I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me and when we were all Fallen to the earth I heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and I said who art thou Lord and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest but rise and stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are Sanctified by faith that is in me H my goodness my goodness you have no idea how my heart is exploding let's pray father we thank you for your love to us Lord this morning and I stand rather astonished Lord as I read the text that I planed to read all week and yet when I read it father I just see such a connection to the thought and the direction you've led me so I just relax myself Lord humble myself before you and ask you to be the speaker in our midst today thank you for answering prayer I give it now quickly into your hands in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated when we were finishing on Wednesday with the sermon into the darkness we were we had tracked the time of the Garden of Eden where they were in a in a state of pure light and pure ecstasy and pure joy in the presence of the Lord daily and and how that we tracked all the way through to the time of the anid deluvian destruction made a number of comments I'm not going to revisit all of that today you can go and catch the Wednesday night archive but we found ourselves from the garden to the day of Enoch to the day of Enoch Noah and we found that Enoch in building his pyramid um you know you you can see that the that the diligence that Enoch had and that he was his perseverance and brother brandham speaks about it often and and he was actually brother brandham talks about how that God has written three Bibles the very first Bible that he ever wrote was in the stars and he put all of the all all of his mystery truths in the heavens and there's still discovering I was just reading yesterday about a a brand new scientific discovery Amen brother Mark almost sent it to you we were brother Mark and I talking about the vast distances you know I if you if you were to travel at the speed of light uh it would only take you a few seconds to get to the moon if you and if you traveled at the speed of light it would only take you a few minutes to get to the Sun but to but to Traverse the entire galaxy would take several couple of thousand years at that same speed so and that's just one Galaxy and they and they they think they understand things until suddenly they see something that they had never seen before because the light of it taking all of these billions of years to reach us finally they see and they saw actually in the heavens a ring of galaxies that they can now see that they had never seen they had seen an arc of galaxies which puzzled them and now they see a ring of galaxies and that the the scientists were saying this is unusual because this is not what we would expect to see from you know if we if our only understanding is that there was a single big bang and now I'm not contesting The Big Bang Theory I like what brother brother Joe used to say there in South Africa uh he would say I I I have no argument against the big bang I just want you to tell me who pulled the trigger so I just thought wow that was a really good good answer and and and so you know brother brandham did lend some to that some Credence to it by saying God spoke and the prophet's words were not big bang he said an Adam bursted God spoke and an Adam bursted an Adam a single Adam bursted and so and so the the Galaxy and so they say you know with that kind of a thinking then you would just naturally not expect to find patterns you'd expect to just find everything dispersed you know like equally out in and and everything should look the same because it's it's it's it's galaxies and planets and stars flying out in every direction and birthing them as it goes so so to find a galaxy of rings not planets not moons galaxies and and and at a and at a greater distance from each other than they than they are to us and they're so far you you would take hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and thousands thousand of of years trying to travel to them at the speed of life so so we realize then that man don't have it all figured out friends and so you know I I when I when I look at Enoch's pyramid here is a man who was a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ and Enoch was figuring out what the world couldn't figure out they had the ability to build they had all kinds of technology to build the Pyramid but that but but theirs was limited to you know that they could build it but how to build it that the pyramid Bible match the Stars Bible because I'm here to tell you something friends when everybody got done building and Enoch built his last element and the world built their last element the world got destroyed Enoch went home so I know that technology is running at a crazy Pace today uh but I'm here to tell you knowledge for the sake of knowledge isn't going to save your life the only way to save your life is to eat of the tree of life and when and when the world has figured out how to destroy itself I you and I will be in glory in another dimension so Enoch you know I I made that statement how that he was he had to in order to have perseverance he would have been building according to the promise that God had made in the fourth chapter of Genesis when he gave a revelation to Abel that he had to bring a blood sacrifice so there was going to have to be a redeemer and God knew that Abel caught that Revelation I I don't suggest that Abel caught everything uh but by the time it got to Enoch there was enough of a catching to give Enoch rapturing faith and I'm here to tell you something friends I know that all the Through the Ages maybe they didn't have it all figured out but at the end time all the Mysteries are made known and this bride is figuring it out how to get home and and I'm glad for that I'm glad I don't have to stay here in this world forever I wouldn't want to have eternal life in this broken down system I want a new world whose Builder and maker is God we found that in our even when they they were at such a simplistic level there coming out of the Garden of Eden it's just when they began the sons of C began to acquire knowledge they began to be artificers and and and instruments and and and they made all kinds of cities and built you know all kinds of uh man-made kingdoms you find nrod doing that on the other side of the flood they just went right back to it now it took a little while but not that long even after Noah came out by you know they were already Hislop records how that they were already moving into false teaching even while the last survivor of the flood which was ham was still alive and was able to be a living witness to testify to him there are there are living Witnesses of what God did in our Day still alive in this world but yet the world is still going off a cliff and God didn't do it in a corner he showed it to the whole world and today there're still Witnesses like Paul said when he spoke about the Ascension of Christ on the Mount of Olives and Paul says there were there are some witnesses who are still alive to this day who were standing there and and Peter that's why why Peter would say we have a more sure word of Prophecy because we have seen these things we have experienced these things and I can't claim that I saw the prophet of this day as a baby I would have no memory of that but I can claim that I've had the same experience I have I can claim that it's doing the same thing for me that it did for him I can claim that the ministry of Elijah that could open up the Jordan when it came to Elisha he could do the same thing because the Jordan represents death and that's the real test of a of a god- calleded Ministry can your ministry reproduce the ministry of Elijah and bring people from the from Death in sickness and sin and the and the diseases of sin and bring them across the Jordan into the promised land of the Holy Ghost that's the credentials of a god-called Ministry when it can accomplish that then it definitely has the same anointing that was on Elijah doesn't make it doesn't make the individual a a a dispensational angel messenger but it doesn't even make a minister that can do that a profit but remember that that that the spirit that that the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy see so regardless of whether it's coming through an apostle a prophet a pastor a teacher an Evangel what it doesn't matter what it's coming through whether it's coming through a Labb person whether it's coming from a parent in a home uh uh putting eternal life before their children the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy amen amen so we found that they began with such a simplistic way we were showing you last time that even their names uh represented Ultra simplistic meanings and you know that that just we you had one son and his name just meant Carrie you know it meant you know you had another one and his name just meant run yeah and so you know the world was just getting started but but by the time it reaches the days of of Enoch it went from finally one man died a man had actually been killed in the earth and it shook everybody until it got to the time of Enoch when God said man's mind all over the Earth is evil continually it's just vile and there was one man with his family Noah who found Grace in the eyes of the of the Lord so we were we were looking how that last time and here's why I want to begin to move forward because we were we were showing last time how that you know in the Garden of Eden the time of the Garden of Eden they lived freely without the sweat of of a man's brow and how we showed you how that every every day for for you know for hundreds of years you know something less than a thousand living out in that seventh day every day for hundreds of years every day for Adam and Eve ended with a worship service and that worship service would go on into the late evening and and it's just like you and I when we leave a good worship service how we go home and we lay in our bed and our hearts are filled with the joys of the Lord and that's the way Adam and Eve every night God would lay them down in their bed and kiss them good night on their cheek and get some rest now my darlings got a big day tomorrow I'm here to tell you something friends oh we're resting in the Holy Ghost but we got a big day coming tomorrow and brother brandham would talk about how that that that picture got marred and and and God's enemy slipped in under the wall and and enticed Eve to step out from behind her protection which was fortified behind the word of God young people don't you realize that that is exactly if you are privileged to have been raised in a message home do you realize you're being fortified behind the word say oh they're limiting me they're they're keeping me they're hindering me I can't do what I want to do you're being protected you're behind the word you got Godly Parents a Godly Pastor a Godly Church Godly Ministry who are fortifying your life don't run around that don't go away from that because that's what's going to keep you safe Eve stepped out and reasoned with it sounded sensible to her once she reasoned the word of God then sin looked desirable see once you start reasoning away the word of God then that sin nature in you is going to start sounding it sounds illogical suddenly you're going to find yourself being drawn and pulled hard by the sin nature that you're born in so so don't do that don't compromise the word of God believe on him whom God ha sent Believe In Christ the word that has been brought in this hour so we find then that once that happened and then I'm not going to go through the quotes today but brother brandham talks about in such such such beautiful ways and how that God came down you know here he come in the cool of the evening like he had done it's it's Church time and God is not going to be late and brother Ram said Jesus always comes when he's invited and so for for every day for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years we don't know exactly something less than than the full thousand years of that seventh day at some point he come down after after so many hundreds of times and and suddenly nobody's at church and something's wrong and Adam and Eve are are hiding and brother brandham just goes through a number of quotes and he he lists several things that he said you see Adam and Eve what they ought to have been doing was they ought to have ran out quickly and repented they ought to ran out quickly instead of running away from him they should have ran to him and fell at his merciful feet say oh God we we've done wrong we're repenting help us forgive us but instead they run away and and the prophet said that's exactly how people do today they they they won't come to church because the church is the house of judgment it's the place where God comes down to show us our pernicious ways where God comes down so that we can look into the mirror of his word and we can see where we need to repent we can see where we need to move up but what happens to people who who go that way suddenly they don't want to go to church anymore they don't want to read their Bible anymore they don't want to repent anymore oh don't make that same mistake friends if you have stumbled run to Jesus if you have fallen get your I'm here to tell you that his Mercy he desires for you to ask for Mercy let me tell you a lie that the devil will tell you you've done this same thing again and again and again and you shouldn't even have the audacity to ask for Mercy I'm here to tell you that's a lie that Christ paid a terrible price so you could ask for mercy and he desires for you to ask again and again and again and again I'm so glad he desired me to ask again and again they don't want want to Fellowship in another place where he would say they lose their desire to Fellowship they things of the world get into their life and suddenly they don't whereas every day that had been a worship service now they're hiding away they don't want to repent they don't want Fellowship they don't want that atmosphere it's starts driving them to other things over the world and the whole world and and brother brandham talks about you know when you try to speak to them they'll say Hey you mind your own business now the reason people do that is because when you when you when you get to the point where you no longer want to sit in the presence of God you no longer want to repent you no longer desire that Fellowship it means that basically you've just started tending to your own business and so you don't want anybody else tending to your business you don't want a preacher you don't want the Holy Ghost you don't want him to come and tend to you you don't want that loved one that family member saying a word to you you just say mind your own business I'll mind my own business I have no desire to mind my business I want him to be my business and when brother brandham tells the story and you can you can believe what you want to believe but I'm here to tell you something friends prophets see things sometimes that blow the human mind oh yeah read your Bible prophets saw things that don't even exist in the natural world and they they they saw things that that just looked crazy where when you know like that preacher said to brother bradam Dr Davis said you know or wasn't Dr Davis is someone else and said you know I John must have ate a hot pepper that night before going to bed to write a book of Revelation like that and brother brandom up braided him and said aren't you ashamed of yourself to say something like that to imagine that the Holy Ghost doesn't know what he's doing I'm here to tell you you've got a word and the Holy Ghost knows exactly what he's doing he knows exactly what you need don't think you know what you need you don't know what you need only he knows what you need that's why the Bible says sometimes the Holy Spirit uh utters out of us groans that can't even be you can't even put it into words he said because the Holy Spirit not only knows what to pray for for you but he knows how to pray for for you and I just say Lord God intercede for me don't never let me get so arrogant that I don't think I need the holy spirit in my life and how that and and so prophets see things in that way I remember brother brandham talking about how that he was he was debating with Dr Davis over the baptism of Jesus I've told this before I tell it again I heard it years ago it's it's it's on tape where brother Brenham is disc is describing I haven't read it in a while but this is the essence of it and he said we were discussing it and Dr Davis said see Billy after Jesus uh after John baptized Jesus then Jesus turned around and baptized John and brother brandom said I don't think so Brother Davis and he said Billy you know that's Baptist teaching he said but it's not Bible teaching the Bible says he went straight way up out of the water so it doesn't mention that you're adding to the scripture and brother Brenham said we went over it and over it year after year year after year he said Till and it was a question in my mind could be right but why does the Bible say he said then one day he said he stood me on the bank there and I watched it take place and he said it was exactly like the Apostle recorded he went straight way up out of the water and immediately the Holy Spirit began to speak so here you've got a you've got you when you read your Bible you can read where it says God came walking the voice of God came walking in the cool of the day now that's not unusual even lexical AES will show you that that's the theophonic uh pre-incarnate of Christ that God who is a spirit no man has seen God at any time but but there are many examples in the Old Testament where he came as a theophany or in a theophonic form he came as a soldier came as an angel came as a man came as this and he he spoke to people and how that he came there in the Garden of Eden in a form that because he had created man see and he made man His Image so God was able to come down say well what what kind of image was he in well he could kiss his children good night he could put lips to their cheek he could speak from lips and they heard it in their ears oh I'm here to tell you something friend don't ever limit the god of Israel don't ever limit God to be able to speak to you exactly how you need him to speak he can meet you anywhere in the perfect condition and brother brandom starts talking about how that you know the voice of God walking was and brother brandom agrees with that with that uh lexical a how that brother Brandon when he describes it I'm not going to read the quotes to save time but I have them how that he was L Elohim the self-existing spirit but then he takes on a form and he comes down and brother brandham said and when brother brandham tells the story I don't know Hey listen friends maybe we can read at one point it's the voice of God walking and that has its certain meaning that even theologians agree with but when a prophet sees it at some point he's no longer walking and he's not just speaking Prophet said he's running up and down the garden and he's to use a Kentucky word hollering he's hollering I thought to myself this wasn't just God coming down like some denominational stuffy quiet uh seminar type of thing this was God demonstrating what a preacher is gonna do I'm standing here today doing the same thing I'm hollering Adam Adam Where Art Thou Adam it showed the mark that would be on the ministry we're not here to just to talk to you or give you some kind of a talk I'm all for any kind of a preaching and teaching I'm for all styles and I do it myself sometimes but it's got to come with power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost because that's the only thing that'll bring Adam back to his senses it's what brought Adam out of his hiding spot maybe it'll bring you out of your hiding spot today amen there's so much to accomplish I know it's I know it's dramatic I get it oh but let me tell you something friends if I if I can use drama to fill your heart and mind and if I can just anoint your imagination Hollywood tries to do it all the time why should I not be a counter voice they've got all kinds of Technology they've got all kinds of special effects and explosions and lights and dazzling and computer images let me tell you if it takes drama to anoint your imagination and stir your heart to where you'll believe there's a new world there's another day and I I've got a a ticket waiting on me then so be it I'll run up and down the garden I'll holler and shout and scream see so it's what what Hollywood has is all just fantasy anyway listen friends don't mistake it young people don't mistake it it's just designed to hypnotize you and keep you in spiritual Amnesia just long enough to miss out on the most epic reality the world has ever known so we find then that after the flood Noah comes out and the Earth is cleaned off and he starts again and it's it's almost no time before even Noah is struggling with weakness of his flesh yes amen it was a Son of God see genan of God but he he couldn't be born again yet because the Holy Ghost wasn't yet given because of the Lamb of God hadn't you see the reason the Lamb of God had to be sacrificed first is because the holy ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost puts you back in connection to the tree of life and there's no way he can let you be reconnected to that tree in a fallen condition that's why he chased Adam and Eve out of the garden lest they put forth their hand and partake of the tree of life and so he hid the way he he he hid it under what Paul called The Mystery of redemption oh I'm here to tell you friends that it is one of the most great unfolding of God's mind before the foundation of the world he would have a family he would have a whole Kingdom and he would spend from the days of Genesis from the time he gave a abble the Revelation in Genesis 4 from the time of Genesis 1: 126 when he said let us make man in our image let him have dominion let him be in our likeness and the prophet said he made his whole family right there I was in his mind you were in his mind and there was nothing not enough devils in Hell there was not an anti- delu destruction there was not Noah's failure there was not Abraham's failure there was not David's failure there was not Moses failure there was nobody's failure going to stop God's plan Hallelujah in that day on Calvary God in the form of a human being was lifted up and said I will draw all men to [Applause] me because the darkness has to be dealt with it had gotten dark in Genesis and coming out and it just got darker still God starts it over in Noah but when they come out they're still in darkness sin is still not dealt with yeah see Satan now brother bam talks about Adam had the book of life and when he forfeited it Satan tried to get it yeah but brother Brenham said but his thank God his Filthy Hands couldn't hold it so it went back to the one who gave it it went back to the one seated on the throne I'm so glad it's in his hands today let me tell you you're in his hands you're not in the devil's hands you're not subject to him today I have been made free by the blood of the Lamb today I'm free to love God according according to the way he wanted to be loved I'm I'm free to worship God because there's only one way you can and that's in spirit and in truth I'm I I have the the freedom to come God's provided way because there's only one provided way hallelujah it's interesting because there was only one provided way and you couldn't provide it so the only thing that could save you you couldn't do I'm so glad somebody could I'm so glad there was a worthy one Hallelujah so he comes you know all the way now he comes to Paul because you have to understand he when he he he comes to Abraham and yet we know brother bam deals with this in the church age book of course it's in the scriptures you can see it very clearly and he says talks about God's Messengers and he said many of them in fact is the majority only a very small minority had you know very little against them you know even like Joseph brother brandham said he perfect in all of his ways but he had one little scratch when he tried to get his daddy to lie to pharaoh to save his skin see so it doesn't matter what it was if you've sinned in one you've sinned in the whole we all come into the world speaking lies we all come into the world Sinners yeah see so it doesn't matter you can't good your way out of that you can't do that you can't good workk your way up and out of that and so you you you you say well if I live the St the the directives of the scripture and live that kind of a life and I'm kind and I'm giving and I'm I'm I'm you know well well does that give me any benefit of course it does absolutely it does you'll be blessed God will bless you He blesses the cheerful Giver he'll you give and he'll cause other men to give to you press down shaking together if you live a decent life people will respect you you'll have a name in the community there's all kinds of blessings you you won't like I said the Christian lifestyle if even if there was no Heaven is a it's a better lifestyle because it's healthier it's safer and and and and you don't spend your money and lose your health over wild crazy living and so it's illogical to not live by God's word and all of that is absolutely true but as for an eternal value you can do all the good works in the world it's not going to give you eternal life there's only one Giver of eternal life and that's Christ and Christ is his word says the wordl see so when we come to the word we're coming to Christ when you reject the word you're rejecting Christ no matter what you think mentally God's not going to judge mentally he's judging in the heart and people can mentally think say and believe they're Christian but if in their heart they resist the word of God how do you exp how do you plan to explain that I I saw yesterday I showed it to my wife and and I showed her a picture of a banana like you could buy at at Publix just a banana nothing special about it and some artist in Italy I think had taken a banana and put it on a whiteboard and put a piece of gray duct tape over it and it was called banana under duct tape or something like that and he he he says this is Art and the art community were like oh wow oh my goodness you say well that doesn't mean anything it didn't until somebody paid $6 million for it amen I said to my wife said that's insane I said it's more than in insane it's obscene let me tell you something friends you're talking to a man who has seen too many Starving Children children I've been into too many places where children don't even have enough food to eat and you feel like you want to feed everybody and there's millions of them you can't even possibly do it and Jesus even said the poor you'll always have with you I get that God's got a plan for that I just say I just give that to the one who knows all about it Hallelujah I can't fix it I can't feed the world I can't fix the whole world but I I do know somebody who can Hallelujah and I said that somebody would spend that kind of money over over something that was so ludicrous and ridiculous to call it art and spend that kind of money when when there's millions of children will go to sleep tonight and haven't eaten in days I said I don't know how they're going how are you going to explain that to God I see people do some of the dumbest things some of some of the craziest things and I if I thought if I could talk to them I would just say listen you're free moral agent you're you're you're you're building the image of God you can put move do whatever you want to do but I'm my question is I see you doing this and I just want to know on that day CU everybody's going to be there at that day and everybody's going to give an account Paul said we shall all stand before that judgment scene give an account see and so on that day how are you going to EXP explain that to the judge yeah what are you going to say I mean I I don't want to be you I don't want to be one of these tyrants you know from from Antiquity or you know the even the IND the an deluvian world and and after that and all these dynasties and these cruel-hearted men who ruled and thought they were gods and and their and life and death was in their tongue and they were just mortal they were just dust they were born they lived and they died and even pharaoh who thought he was a god thought he was the son of the morning and we we find that that the Bible says that when finally Pharaoh descended after death it wasn't a pretty picture he descended down into a dark pit you remember we took the text last Wednesday how that the Angels which kept not their first estate he threw them into a pit of darkness and Gloom the Bible says that everybody from behind their cell the cells were all along the walls of this I don't know use your imagination this ginormous Pit and the wall is from as high and his load as you can see as cells of people and they they they come to the bars as Pharaoh is descending this is in the scriptures and they start they start saying ah Pharaoh finally you too have come take your place in the wall yourselves waiting on you oh I don't want to be that person I don't want to have to try to give an account of my miserable life I just want to say I Jesus led me all the way Jesus led me all the way that's all I know that's all I want to know that's all I care about knowing when I fail him I Repent when I when I have faith in him I'll go forward If I Stumble I'll repent and get back up and go forward again there's no turning back for me there's no quitting no stopping no falling away I'll die first before I ever leave Christ in his word hallelujah hallelujah so we find then that he's going to come to that day on Calvary and after his death burial Resurrection his Ascension and he sent his Spirit back into the Earth and now he comes to Paul because if you'll remember in our text this is when he's standing before grippa Jewish King and he's giving his testimony Paul I hear all kinds of crazy things about you you you were a man of renown you reputable you are a man of learning you're a man of of great of great knowledge and and you understood great things how is it why do I hear that you've lost your mind explain yourself Paul what can Paul do what can you do how would you explain the opportunities that you've let DFT on by to follow Jesus how you going to make sense of that how you going to stand you think I could make sense of it I wasn't in this town five years and I had one of the wealthiest men in Hilton had who liked my way of doing things and wanted to hire me and I and of course I wasn't going to do it I was pastoring he said well if you're ever not going to do that anymore please come see me and so I just said well what could I hope to realize he said i' give you my word you'd make your first million in your first year and I'd put you in in in contact with the with all of the families the the movers and the Shakers you've got the personality you've got the appeal you've got the look that they're looking for you you could go far and I just thought wouldn't Satan love to see me prostitute the gift of God and I just said well thank you I appreciate your compliments and I walked away from there and I said Lord God I will let me never compromise the word of God I'll take the way with the Lord's despise few I started with Jesus Jesus guess what I'm going through how can I explain that to somebody they would say you're nuts you're crazy and they'd be right I lost my mind and I got the mind of Christ and that's the only mind I've ever cared about having and that's the why I preach I want you to adopt that mind of Christ this world is not my home this world this life is not about this life it's about the next one coming oh I know it's dark now but Joy comes in the morning all Paul could do was what you do what I do all I can do is tell you my experience I can't I'm sorry that I can't make sense out of why I have spurned the world why I have passed on opportunity after opportunity to stay with God's humble people you think Moses could explain that when Moses here he was and they said look Moses you can be you'll be pharaoh and then you can change the law and help your people Moses didn't want to come a man-made way a man-made way sounds so logical sensible brother brandom uses that exact words the the the whole uh the whole seed of the Roman Catholic system and the whole thing of uh of nianis and B alism and brother brandham says and they said you know we we need to establish what we believe we need to write a Creed and we need to put it all in writing we need to put a period on it and brother brandham said that sounded sensible that's logical I I'm glad we got 1,00 tapes yeah you understand I'm glad God thought to do it that way but brother brandham said what sounded logical and sensible and reasonable ended up being the seeds of the Catholic Church am I'm here to tell you something friends do not put God in a box do not limit the god of Israel do not try to make him fit your agenda you just want to raise up both hands and say I surrender all All to Jesus I Surrender I'm not here to try to explain my life I ow I owe this Earth no explanation I owe the devil no explanation I don't want a treaty I don't want an armist I hate that guy I Want To Be A Champion for the Holy Spirit I want to go forward like Paul did and tell them how I got saved and he just simply says look King here's the deal I went to Damascus with authority and letters I was the man I had a I had a federal mandate well Paul okay good start who what what hindered you why did you not make it why did you change course well the truth is your majesty at around noon you know I saw in the way a light now a lot of people see a light Paul said I saw a light from Heaven see th this is this is exactly what what Adam saw this is what John saw this is what they you know John the Baptist he saw that that Pillar of Fire in the bodily shape of a dove come down you know th this is what Moses saw this is what Isaiah saw they describe it as this great light and Paul says it was a light from Heaven brighter than the sun shining around about me and the men that journeyed with me and we fell to the ground and I heard a voice saying to me Saul Saul why persecutest thou me oh my I think here we are again it's Genesis all over it's not Adam Adam it's Saul Saul Adam Adam you you you've plunged the world into darkness son you've broken the Covenant now you're going to have to leave the garden now you're going to have to go out of my presence but I'm glad it went from Adam Adam to Saul Saul I'm going to send you to the Gentiles because I'm bringing life back to my family Hallelujah friends God wasn't listen God was finished with just trying to call Israel as a nation of servants I'm here to tell you God was about to do something different he was about to go Global and why would he go Global because this is going to be a global bride across two 2,000 years across seven continuous and continuous Church ages and God is going to redeem a family back home Saul Saul do you hear his voice today do are you willing to come from Darkness to light because that's what the ministry of Christ is all about this was the promise Saul I'm I'm going to keep my promise this hasn't been since Genesis when a man would have dominion once again he would be restored back to my exact image and my exact likeness and he would have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and every creeping thing upon the Earth even that he says to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea even if he says to a fig tree no man eat from thee from this day forward even if he should drink a deadly thing even if a Viper bites him none of this will stop you I have given you power to tread on scorpions and snakes and and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you oh do you realize it doesn't matter what happens to your body nothing can by any means hurt you you passed from Death to life and light has come back in the darkness and a light from Heaven this is exactly what the ministry of Christ was that was the son of man Ministry because it was a word made flesh it fit God's perfect plan Seven Ages were purposed now to fill the role from the Lamb's Book of Life and to finish the bride's call among the Gentiles before turning back to gather the elected Jew under Moses and Elijah it All Began that day on Calvary oh I'm here to tell something friend from the Creator from the Creator's view I and I just and I'm gonna I'm G to hit another pause here because I don't want to go into the the third installment but I I I just let me come come to a close with this thought he trusted Noah and he failed he trusted Moses he trusted Abraham he trusted David he trusted them all and they all failed him even John the Baptist doubted his own Ministry after God after giving Christ such a compliment even Joseph had a little scratch against his life and he is a perfect type of Christ and brother brandham said concerning the the the the ministers and The Messengers and the prophets the apostles and everybody that God has ever used down Through the Ages don't think they were perfect people come on far from it brother brand would go on to say in fact is the ones who who who have a life with failure and and you know that that far out stripped I forget the exact word on have it in front of me but the ones who lived with failure in their life many of them with multiple failures Abraham got caught lying and then got caught lying again and then that passed on to his son Isaac and then he got caught lying in the same way for the same reason Moses was fine but Moses never got his temper under control and it cost him David was a man after God's Own Heart but but oh he he lifted his eyes in the wrong direction friends God doesn't want you to lift your eyes in the wrong direction he said to Abraham lift up now Thine Eyes listen the first time that was ever said in the Bible was when the Bible says lot Abraham said choose you'll go and the Bible said lot lifted up his eyes and looked toward the fertile Plains of Sodom and he thought you know I can make a living down there I can be successful down there and that's the first time that the Bible says he lifted up his eyes and when light when we know how that story ended amen but then he comes back to Abraham now that he has separated himself now that Abraham has obeyed all the word of God then God says lift up now thine eyes eyes and look northward and Eastward Westward and Southward and everything you see northward Southward Eastward Westward all of this all of this have I given you Hallelujah don't lift up your eyes to the world lift up your eyes to the word lift up your eyes to Christ today this is exactly what he was trying to get the people to do to God it just seemed like enough was enough and brother brandham said the ones that failed him far outpace the ones who seen and brother in fact is in one place in the same place brother brandham said in many respects they wouldn't seem inhuman they wouldn't even seem to qualify but what you can't deny is God used them you can read their stories and it looks like when I read this I go my goodness this man couldn't even qualify and yet I read what wait a minute God kept you God kept oh my go wow look at the ending amen oh I'm here to tell you but God had had men rise up and fall and rise up and fall and God kept going and another Prophet would rise up and make a mistake and God kept going and another Sage would rise up and have an error but God kept going God was determined to get to a man who would not fail and that's why God the only way he could do it was to Tabernacle himself in a human flesh and come down and Jesus said I do always that which pleases the father God had said enough was enough because he's now going to introduce a sweeping change in the order of things and he says Paul I'm taking you out of Darkness I'm going to bring you to the Glorious light and you're going to take that light to the Gentiles and the light that you live that you leave behind is going to go to Ephesus and Sam and to pergamus and th Ty and it's going to go all through seven Church ages it's going to go down to nothing and it's going to come back up to everything and at the end there's going to be a bride who's going to stand on the earth and the Bible says in the spirit and the bride say come because why God had had enough of man failing he was going to have a bride who would not disbelieve in word he's going to have a misses Jesus Christ from Darkness to dark and even darker still but now we find that a glorious light is prophesied at the end time and you bride you have come from the East and from the West you've come to the brightness of his Rising arise shine thy light has come we're done stand up hallelujah hallelujah this is where you have come to friends you've come to the brightness of his Rising the Lord being my helper I want to take a third installment as I announced Wednesday the Lord being my helper I want to title it the end of Darkness amen amen the end of Darkness it is the rising of the sun see do you believe it friends let's bow our head as they as we get our piano player amen just give me something there Brothers amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads all over the building Master oh we thank you Lord how we thank you for your great grace Lord and father I've went now these minutes Lord before the people we tried to bring the story forward to our day we've come now Lord to the end of it all father and I I pray now that you will be our helper Lord as we look to these things further we don't we don't know exactly Lord everything that you'll have to say to us but we do know that you have plenty to say the end of Darkness I want to come Lord to the rise of the day star Peter said Peter warned that we would have to go for a while that the church would have to go for a while and he said God's not slack don't think that he's overdue or forgot his church it was always going to the church was always going to go through 2,000 years of Seven Ages that was going to be used by you to fill the role to gather every one of those names in the Lamb's Book of Life and now we've come to this hour Lord where the the Earth is dark and gross darkness is upon the people but there's a rising of the day star and we're coming to the end of Darkness oh my soul is thrilled to think of it when Sons and Daughters of the Living God shall walk freely in the Earth again and there shall be all the glory of God filling the universe oh Lamb of God Satan Bound for a thousand years while your family enjoys a honeymoon oh Lamb of God what what awaits us it's joy unspeakable we can not even describe it in our wildest imagination Hollywood with all of their technology could never touch it we have come now Lord to the end of Darkness we have come to the rising of the day star that Peter said would come we were were to hold on we were to keep going we were to keep believing we were to have perfect faith and perfect love hang on Peter said until the day star rise in your hearts oh Lamb of God you had the plan you have executed that plan flawlessly with such Precision everyone that's ever responded to the word of God came to you under precisely how you had it planned there's no devil that can stop it Lord so I pray today Father here's my prayer that people will see what that day on Calvary meant that they'll see that they don't have to be bound by the sin they were born into they can be free to serve God according to the real deep desires of their heart they don't have to they don't have to battle that flesh the the prophet taught us the the idea in the greatest battle ever fought is not to just drag it out but to end it to put it down to stop it move it move deeper into Christ I pray you help me you know I can't go any further Lord I'd be in the into the third installment but Lord that's where we're headed oh God what you have done for us in this hour defies all imagination it defies expectation of the world no one thought you could pull it off so perfectly the devil has fought no doubt thinking he will win win not only realizing not realizing that it's already too late he can't win the Bride of this day is already birthed by the word she's on the scene she's a final voice to the final age and she is she is she is fortified against being deceived she's predestinated not to fall and God who created all things we'll see to it I thank you for these things Lord we praise you we glorify you I pray young people will take a fresh look at that day on Calvary what it meant what God did after after suffering 4,000 years the world rejecting him full of heathenism his own Nation Israel on again off again on again off again they're in they're out they're up they're down God had had enough of it God was going to change the order of things he was going to bring forth a perfect lamb oh Master help us today help us
