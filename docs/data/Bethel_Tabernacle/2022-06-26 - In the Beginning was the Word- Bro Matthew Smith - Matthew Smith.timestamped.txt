[1:58] please
[2:01] [Music]
[2:24] all right
[2:27] uh all right we're on um good morning
[2:29] everybody we'll stand and have a quick
[2:31] word of prayer
[2:35] father we come before you this morning
[2:37] asked that you would
[2:38] come into our presence father and then
[2:40] you would anoint my heart and my mind
[2:42] and my lips that i would speak what you
[2:43] would have me to say these people father
[2:45] that they would be able to see the
[2:47] see see what i see in it father because
[2:49] i see you and what i what a little
[2:51] material that i have your father
[2:53] and um i asked that you would
[2:56] allow me to
[2:57] say something that would allow them to
[2:59] walk closer to you in the weeks and days
[3:01] coming um in jesus name amen y'all can
[3:04] be seated um
[3:05] so last week we had a little biology
[3:08] lesson um and we went through a lot of
[3:11] like little microscopic structures and
[3:13] you know we'll see over here so you all
[3:15] remember that um
[3:17] and we really the whole purpose of that
[3:18] was we were showing how and originally
[3:21] kind of started with a
[3:22] a group of scientists who were able to
[3:24] use
[3:25] this these
[3:27] microscopic structures as a way of
[3:28] proving that all life on earth was made
[3:31] by some sort of intelligence right it
[3:32] wasn't intelligently designed
[3:34] um
[3:35] and that it wasn't just due to some
[3:37] random chance right and the the core of
[3:40] that whole argument really at the bottom
[3:42] of it was that inside of every living
[3:44] organism because you have a genetic
[3:46] package dna
[3:47] and that is written instructions on how
[3:49] to build that entire creature
[3:51] and
[3:52] to look at that and say that that's a
[3:54] random chance it doesn't really make any
[3:56] sense any more than if you know you were
[3:58] out in the desert and you saw a bunch of
[3:59] rocks in a row that also happened to be
[4:01] a pattern that corresponded with every
[4:04] you know the pattern of every amino acid
[4:06] in the human body we wouldn't say that
[4:08] that was just you know the wind blew
[4:09] rocks in that pattern right you know
[4:12] obviously someone put it there um
[4:14] and um and that it's it's an
[4:16] intelligently organized structure
[4:20] um and so we were because of this we can
[4:22] really prove that inside of every human
[4:23] being there's a there's a genetic you
[4:26] know in the dna that's intelligently
[4:29] designed there's no way that that just
[4:30] happened randomly
[4:32] and so
[4:33] um you have these scientists and they
[4:36] they all got together and agreed okay we
[4:37] can prove beyond any shroud of a doubt
[4:39] this is
[4:40] all life on earth comes from some
[4:43] intelligence
[4:44] and that's as far as they got
[4:47] um
[4:48] and we look at this and it's beautiful i
[4:50] love it i think it's awesome to see god
[4:52] but you know
[4:53] these scientists can prove intelligent
[4:55] design and they never not once mentioned
[4:57] god
[4:58] they didn't mention a creator they
[5:00] didn't mention the bible they didn't
[5:01] mention the name jehovah didn't do
[5:03] anything like that because they were
[5:05] able to improve intelligent design
[5:06] through science they didn't prove
[5:08] god the way we recognize god through you
[5:10] know
[5:11] as god um
[5:14] and that's partly why i mean
[5:16] you know again notice last week we we
[5:18] were able to prove intel's design and
[5:20] never cracked open a bible
[5:22] right because it's because science
[5:24] doesn't require a bible to function
[5:26] because science is running on something
[5:27] very very different
[5:29] now
[5:30] the
[5:31] the the
[5:34] the
[5:34] kind of thing that struck me so much
[5:36] about
[5:37] that whole
[5:38] that
[5:39] the scientists were able to prove
[5:40] intelligent design without ever
[5:44] even acknowledging god is that
[5:46] because they did it scientifically
[5:50] they were able to prove that god exists
[5:53] that some sort of god exists but they
[5:54] can't tell you anything about god
[5:57] right they can't tell you what he's like
[5:58] they can't tell you whether or not he
[6:00] likes you
[6:01] right the two greatest questions i feel
[6:03] the two greatest questions that any
[6:04] human being can ask are is god real and
[6:07] does god care about you
[6:09] because
[6:10] you know one without the other
[6:13] not as having answered either one of
[6:14] those questions creates huge problems so
[6:17] for instance i mean these scientists are
[6:19] a lot of times are approaching atheists
[6:21] who don't believe in any kind of god to
[6:23] prove god to them but the problem is if
[6:25] you prove that god exists to an atheist
[6:28] you haven't really given him any hope
[6:30] because now he doesn't know anything
[6:32] about that god you they didn't they
[6:34] didn't prove christianity they only
[6:37] proved that there is some creator that
[6:38] may or may not hate you
[6:40] right
[6:41] that's it they proved they proved islam
[6:43] as much as they proved christianity
[6:46] right they didn't
[6:47] you know
[6:48] there's in fact there's a
[6:50] whole genre of horror books and fiction
[6:53] about
[6:54] that the guy by the name of hp lovecraft
[6:56] wrote back in the 1900s early 1900s that
[6:59] dealt explicitly with what does the
[7:01] world look like if there's a deity an
[7:03] actual god that happens to hate humanity
[7:06] right
[7:07] or maybe he's just indifferent maybe
[7:09] just doesn't care maybe maybe god just
[7:10] made the universe and
[7:12] just went and took a nap
[7:14] you know and now it's all just running
[7:16] off the rails and falling apart because
[7:18] who cares right you know no no the
[7:20] creator of the thing doesn't care
[7:22] anymore
[7:23] you know um what happens if if there's a
[7:26] deity you know all of creation is built
[7:29] by an indifferent god or
[7:31] more specifically what if it's a
[7:32] vindictive god who just gets his kicks
[7:34] by torturing things
[7:36] right
[7:37] you know i mean have you ever seen a
[7:38] little kid get a magnifying glass and
[7:40] start burning ants
[7:42] right
[7:43] little kids do that stuff what's to say
[7:44] that there isn't what's to say that
[7:45] we're not living in some you know cosmic
[7:48] scale little kids ant farm who's having
[7:50] fun burning ants
[7:52] right sure would explain a lot of things
[7:53] wouldn't it
[7:54] right
[7:55] you know
[7:56] there's by by proving that there's a god
[8:01] but you haven't made any
[8:04] proof as to whether or not that god
[8:05] cares about you
[8:06] you just prove that god did the
[8:08] holocaust on purpose
[8:11] right and he did it just to hurt people
[8:14] i mean what else explanation is there if
[8:16] you don't have any evidence as to
[8:17] whether or not god cares about you
[8:20] and so the reason the reason why we we
[8:23] have this problem
[8:25] is
[8:27] ultimately because
[8:29] science
[8:31] these scientists were able to prove the
[8:32] existence of god but nothing about the
[8:33] nature of god because they're they're
[8:35] running off of the tree of knowledge of
[8:37] good and evil
[8:38] right i want to i want to read a quote
[8:41] here um
[8:42] i got a couple of them but
[8:45] um this is from separation from unbelief
[8:48] 1955. it says um
[8:51] uh i said well i appreciate that and
[8:53] that's good but i said
[8:54] here's what it is science doesn't know
[8:56] god i said you climb up this tree so far
[8:59] and the tree of knowledge only goes so
[9:01] far and then it's all the higher you can
[9:04] go i said climb up the tree of knowledge
[9:06] just as far as you can and step off on
[9:08] the tree of faith and go on believing on
[9:10] up like that
[9:12] um
[9:14] here's another one and i like this one
[9:15] particularly um this is where i think
[9:18] pentecost this is the message where i
[9:19] think pentecost failed
[9:21] that i said
[9:22] now here's what it is i said now you've
[9:24] got an x-ray machine there you can look
[9:26] through a human body and so forth well
[9:29] that's wonderful that's the tree of
[9:31] knowledge
[9:32] that was in the garden of eden and man's
[9:34] been eating from that tree since eden
[9:37] but i said it's got a limitation
[9:40] the tree of faith
[9:42] uh
[9:42] faith of god is unlimited i said you
[9:44] believe science as far as science can go
[9:47] and then when you can't you can't
[9:49] scientifically search it out anymore
[9:51] then step off and start believing from
[9:53] then on
[9:54] that's the way you have to do it
[9:57] okay
[9:58] so
[9:59] the reason why these scientists have a
[10:01] limitation is because they're operating
[10:02] on the tree of knowledge
[10:05] in the garden of eden you have two trees
[10:07] we're all aware
[10:08] one of those is the tree of life and man
[10:10] was never forbidden of eating from that
[10:12] tree of life
[10:14] um until man fell and then god put a
[10:16] flaming sword in the way right the
[10:18] reason why is because eating of the tree
[10:19] of life brings eternal life
[10:21] and when you
[10:23] but we also know that christ is that god
[10:25] is that is that tree of life when when
[10:27] adam and eve were eating of the tree of
[10:29] life it was in the cool of the day when
[10:30] god came down to commune with them
[10:32] right
[10:33] they had a relationship with the tree of
[10:34] life
[10:36] and so
[10:38] when when but they chose this path of of
[10:41] knowledge right this tree of knowledge
[10:42] and all your science is coming from that
[10:44] tree of knowledge
[10:45] and no matter how high you climb the
[10:48] tree of knowledge you're not going to
[10:50] find god in it
[10:51] because god's the tree of life you're in
[10:53] the wrong tree
[10:55] right
[10:56] and
[10:57] you're not going to know anything about
[10:59] god you're not gonna know anything about
[11:01] how what he's like what his personality
[11:03] is like does he care about you is there
[11:06] is there any kind of affection there
[11:08] right
[11:09] you can prove he exists but you can't
[11:11] prove whether or not he cares about you
[11:14] and
[11:15] there's only one way to do that right
[11:18] you have to step off that tree of
[11:19] knowledge you have to
[11:21] you know take advantage of the fact that
[11:25] one day
[11:26] on calvary there was an atonement paid
[11:28] and when that there's a there's a little
[11:30] there's a little thing there that a lot
[11:31] of people everybody knows about but
[11:32] everybody kind of doesn't overlooks and
[11:34] that is
[11:35] that curtain that separated man from the
[11:37] holiest hope of holies got rid torn in
[11:39] half from the top to bottom that's a
[11:41] significant event
[11:42] right because we know that you know when
[11:44] those priests would step behind that
[11:46] curtain
[11:47] if they're if they had any sin in their
[11:49] life they'd be they'd be struck dead
[11:51] instantly
[11:52] well why it's because that flaming sword
[11:55] that prevented adam and eve from going
[11:57] back to the tree of life
[11:58] was right there behind that curtain
[12:01] you know that tree of life lived on the
[12:02] other side of that curtain and if you
[12:04] stepped across the path of that flaming
[12:06] sword and you had any sin in your life
[12:08] you're done
[12:09] right you can't live in that presence
[12:11] but when that curtain is torn it means
[12:13] there's an atonement paid and that sword
[12:15] is no longer there right there's there's
[12:18] an open path back to the tree of life
[12:22] and you know um
[12:28] i i find that a major problem that
[12:30] people run into even a lot of a lot of
[12:33] we would say nominal christians
[12:36] is they have a tree of knowledge
[12:38] relationship with god
[12:40] right it's what they can verify their
[12:42] their relationship with god goes as far
[12:43] as well i believe in a god
[12:45] and that's good enough right
[12:47] well no
[12:49] um i want to read i have it written down
[12:51] in my in my little book here um
[12:54] so you don't have to initially turn to
[12:55] it if i can
[12:56] find it yeah here
[12:58] so this is james chapter 2 verse 19. it
[13:00] says thou believeth that there is one
[13:03] god
[13:03] thou doest dust well the devils also
[13:06] believe
[13:07] and tremble
[13:09] right
[13:10] so science which is this construction of
[13:13] the tree of knowledge
[13:15] is great we can even see we can see an
[13:16] aspect of god from it but you're not
[13:18] gonna know anything about god and the
[13:19] maximum level of revelation that you're
[13:22] gonna get by climbing the tree of
[13:24] knowledge is equivalent with satan
[13:27] right you're gonna tr you're gonna reach
[13:29] lucifer's level of of relationship with
[13:31] god
[13:32] from that tree of knowledge
[13:36] and as a result
[13:38] if you if all you had was that tree of
[13:40] knowledge you're going to end up
[13:41] believing
[13:43] things like well god did the holocaust
[13:44] on purpose
[13:46] right you're going to believe
[13:48] a lot of horrible things about god
[13:50] because you don't actually have a
[13:52] relationship there you never met god you
[13:53] only just sort of
[13:55] got some sort of
[13:56] second hand opinion of him
[13:58] right you got some view but you never
[14:00] actually
[14:01] never actually met him
[14:03] right
[14:05] and um i think
[14:07] i said this at the youth meeting i think
[14:09] this is
[14:10] i will say this forever i think is one
[14:12] of the absolute favorite things i've
[14:14] ever heard in my life and that is
[14:16] that until you've met god for yourself
[14:20] and had a conversation with god
[14:22] everything you think you know about god
[14:24] is a secondhand opinion
[14:26] right it you you have no right to have
[14:28] any opinion on god or what he's like or
[14:31] whether or not he cares about you
[14:32] whether or not he cares about anybody
[14:33] else until you've had a conversation
[14:35] with him
[14:36] right until you've had that moment
[14:40] where
[14:40] [Music]
[14:42] you know like ruth
[14:43] had to go alone and have that
[14:46] that very personal private conversation
[14:48] with boaz
[14:50] right alone personal to her exclusively
[14:54] until you've had that you don't really
[14:56] know
[14:57] you might think you know you might have
[15:00] you know some sort of inclination like
[15:01] well the bible says that jesus loves me
[15:03] and and that's good and you should
[15:04] believe that because the bible said it
[15:06] but until you've actually met the author
[15:09] you know
[15:10] you you really don't understand what
[15:12] that means
[15:13] you really don't you don't really know
[15:15] anything about the tree of life
[15:17] until you've actually
[15:20] had a conversation with the tree of life
[15:22] right
[15:24] and
[15:27] i think this
[15:29] i i really you know um
[15:32] when i when i saw this um
[15:37] it it so struck me that we are so
[15:38] privileged to understand that
[15:43] um
[15:46] and um one of the
[15:49] i would i also kind of have another
[15:51] little way of looking at this and that
[15:52] is another aspect on this right and
[15:55] that's because
[15:56] i remember i said that
[15:57] you know you could have a tree of
[15:59] knowledge understanding of god
[16:01] that you can think scientifically and
[16:03] and get some sort of
[16:05] aspect of of what god is like but you're
[16:08] not really going to know anything about
[16:09] it
[16:10] or you can prove god's existence but you
[16:12] can't really
[16:13] have a relationship with him
[16:15] through science well
[16:18] we're all aware of the scientific method
[16:20] and
[16:20] you know we've heard that term
[16:22] um where the scientific method comes
[16:24] from is this
[16:26] uh it's actually a philosophy um called
[16:29] empiricism
[16:30] like brother matt mentioned this a while
[16:31] back but when he was preaching
[16:33] um but
[16:34] empiricism is simply the idea that the
[16:37] only way to know what's true is by what
[16:38] can be measured physically or sensed you
[16:41] know you can observe with your senses
[16:44] right
[16:44] you know you might have somebody who
[16:46] thinks something's really logical and
[16:47] makes a lot of sense but until you put
[16:48] it to the test you don't really know if
[16:50] it's true
[16:51] um so you know i think the example that
[16:53] i gave was um i think it was aristotle
[16:56] the greek argued that men had more teeth
[16:58] than women because they were bigger had
[16:59] to eat more food therefore it made since
[17:00] they had more teeth
[17:02] right
[17:03] um
[17:04] and all the greeks around him was like
[17:05] yeah that makes total sense um
[17:08] good job aristotle figuring out about
[17:09] the teeth
[17:11] and then somebody and somehow nobody
[17:13] thought to raise their hand and just say
[17:14] well why don't we just count um
[17:17] well it turns out it took a like a
[17:19] thousand years but eventually somebody
[17:20] did count um and it turns out that no
[17:22] that's complete bogus um
[17:24] men and women have the same number of
[17:25] teeth uh there's some variation there
[17:27] some women have more some men have more
[17:29] but about it's on average about the same
[17:31] um
[17:34] and so that's that's what empiricism did
[17:35] right it went from okay this makes uh
[17:37] you can make a logical argument there
[17:39] but until you actually start counting
[17:40] teeth you don't really know
[17:42] right and so likewise scientists the
[17:45] scientific method is like okay we can
[17:46] theorize that somewhere on the inside of
[17:48] your cell there is some set of
[17:49] instructions for your whole body but
[17:51] until we you know pull out the x-ray you
[17:53] know crystallography machine we don't
[17:55] actually know
[17:56] right
[17:57] because that's
[17:58] uh anyways the
[18:00] point is we have a lot of tools and
[18:01] instruments now that can enhance our
[18:03] senses to see things that we can't
[18:04] necessarily see with our senses but the
[18:06] point is we have some way of detecting
[18:07] things and and putting a measure on them
[18:12] and
[18:13] we say okay this is
[18:16] you know we can prove the existence of
[18:18] of dna and how it works and all this
[18:20] stuff and you don't it doesn't require
[18:22] any faith the whole purpose of the
[18:23] scientific method is that you can know
[18:25] truth without requiring faith to do it
[18:28] right this is why like in the medical
[18:30] field when they're when they're
[18:31] developing medication
[18:32] um they do things like double blind
[18:34] trials where not even the doctor who's
[18:36] giving the medication knows what's the
[18:38] placebo and what's the
[18:40] legitimate medicine
[18:41] because they know the placebo effect is
[18:43] a real thing right if you are giving
[18:44] someone an experimental drug to reduce
[18:46] blood pressure you don't actually know
[18:47] if it works or not but you tell them
[18:48] that they're getting a drug that reduces
[18:50] blood pressure you could be given a
[18:51] sugar pill and it'll still reduce their
[18:52] blood pressure slightly
[18:54] right because they believe it does and
[18:56] so there's this there's this we know the
[18:58] policible effect is a real thing
[19:01] but in order for it to the drug to be
[19:02] accepted you have to show that the
[19:04] actual drug reduced the heart or the
[19:06] blood pressure
[19:07] more than the placebo effect okay
[19:11] in other words
[19:12] you have to prove that the medication
[19:14] works whether or not they have faith in
[19:15] it or not
[19:16] okay
[19:17] i and you know brother branham said that
[19:19] this is you know the medication came
[19:20] from god i believe that's true it's for
[19:21] people who don't have the faith for
[19:22] their own divine healing so they can you
[19:25] have people who don't have the faith for
[19:26] it can still get healing right
[19:29] um
[19:31] so
[19:33] um
[19:34] anyway so the idea is that you the whole
[19:37] purpose of science is you have a
[19:38] faithless
[19:40] you have faithless knowledge
[19:42] right
[19:44] which for people who don't have any
[19:45] faith is really good because they might
[19:46] then they get to know things um
[19:49] but you're not going to know god that
[19:50] way because you have to have some amount
[19:52] of faith no god right you're not going
[19:54] to know god in a faithless manner if you
[19:56] do the only again you're going to have a
[19:58] tree of knowledge understanding of of
[20:00] god which is going to be completely
[20:04] you won't require you to have any faith
[20:07] but it's also not going to be a clear
[20:08] picture of god either it's going to be
[20:10] you're going to be aware of him but
[20:11] you're not going to know him
[20:14] exactly it's a it's a it's a painted
[20:16] fire
[20:17] and so
[20:19] again you have a lot of you have a lot
[20:21] of
[20:22] um
[20:23] you know
[20:24] nominal christians who have some
[20:26] knowledge of god
[20:27] don't actually know god and they have a
[20:28] painted fire
[20:30] now
[20:31] where and a lot of it comes down to what
[20:34] i can prove right what i can prove you
[20:36] know a lot of people will you know watch
[20:38] a documentary about some scientists who
[20:39] prove the existence of god and go
[20:41] well i'm a christian now because i can
[20:43] prove that god exists
[20:45] well he didn't have any faith to do that
[20:47] right you didn't actually get a
[20:49] relationship with god and that's why
[20:50] you're christian you're just doing that
[20:51] because you saw some scientists put
[20:53] their stamp on it right you have no more
[20:56] you have no more faith in that than you
[20:58] would if they if a scientist came along
[21:00] and said that god didn't exist
[21:02] right same amount of faith required for
[21:04] both of those positions
[21:06] the as long as you're basing it on what
[21:07] science can prove
[21:10] the the
[21:12] and so
[21:13] one of the things that i that i noticed
[21:15] was you know a lot of times people in
[21:18] the message will do the same thing they
[21:19] just don't realize this is what they're
[21:20] doing
[21:21] so there's a lot of people in the
[21:23] message will go i believe in the message
[21:25] of the hour because they were miracles
[21:28] right there was it's really you don't
[21:31] have to argue doctrine you don't have to
[21:33] understanding have an understanding of
[21:34] the word of god you don't have to have a
[21:37] any relationship with god to believe in
[21:39] the message of the hour if you just go
[21:41] well it must be true god took a picture
[21:43] with this guy
[21:45] right it's there's not a whole there's
[21:46] not a lot of counter-argument to yeah
[21:48] god took a picture with him though
[21:50] right you don't have to have any sort of
[21:52] understanding of any doctrine that he
[21:53] brought
[21:54] if that if that if you're like well
[21:56] clearly this is this is an empirical
[21:58] thing that i can see i don't have to
[21:59] have any faith in in brother branham's
[22:01] ministry
[22:02] or that there was a divine aspect to it
[22:04] if i see a picture of it
[22:07] right and so people will
[22:08] go you know be like well the message of
[22:10] the hour you know you know the this is
[22:12] the message it's the real word of god
[22:14] and i didn't have to have a relationship
[22:16] with god to know that
[22:17] right they can they can you can have
[22:19] complete
[22:20] recite every doctrine front to back
[22:22] letter for letter
[22:23] word you know word for word 100 perfect
[22:26] and never have had to actually had a
[22:28] single scrap of faith for it
[22:30] right never had to have an actual
[22:32] relationship with god to do it
[22:34] right it's a complete head knowledge it
[22:36] is they have no
[22:38] more um
[22:41] actual relationship with god than the
[22:43] scientist who knows no more about god
[22:45] than what he can see under a microscope
[22:47] right because it was a complete tree of
[22:49] knowledge relationship with god
[22:52] right it is i know this to be the case
[22:54] because i have a piece of evidence to
[22:56] prove it right i saw a picture on the
[22:58] cover of time magazine therefore it must
[23:00] be true
[23:01] it's like okay but do you know that it's
[23:02] true because you had a relationship with
[23:04] god
[23:04] right a lot of people saw the cover of
[23:06] time magazine a lot of people saw the
[23:08] cover of time magazine and believed that
[23:10] god put the cloud there a lot of people
[23:12] believed that until they didn't
[23:14] right a lot of people believed that and
[23:16] they don't believe it anymore
[23:18] because i think his brother jason said
[23:20] this or that's where i heard the first
[23:22] time
[23:23] and it so struck me if you can get
[23:24] talked into it you can get talked right
[23:26] back out of it
[23:27] right if you have some logical empirical
[23:30] relationship with god
[23:33] you can be logically and empirically
[23:35] talked right back out of it right as
[23:39] i know this because i spent enough time
[23:41] in a college lecture hall
[23:43] taking biology courses to know that if
[23:45] you can prove god is real
[23:48] you know through looking at some dna i
[23:50] guarantee you there's some guys out
[23:51] there who can make a pretty solid
[23:52] argument the other way and if you're
[23:54] only
[23:55] if your only
[23:57] uh belief in god is because some
[23:59] scientists told you so
[24:01] and i guarantee you there's some
[24:02] scientists out there who can convince
[24:03] you the other way and if you're
[24:05] if you're only
[24:08] um
[24:10] if your only belief in the message of
[24:12] the hour is because you saw some you you
[24:15] are aware of some sort of supernatural
[24:17] events that are associated with a
[24:19] particular ministry
[24:22] you better be better watch out because
[24:26] all through the message i don't know if
[24:27] any of you guys have um been listening
[24:30] to the uh like ashamed brother brother
[24:32] jason's uh um going through all those uh
[24:34] sermons that uh brother brown preached
[24:36] on the vials
[24:37] um
[24:38] i believe he's actually continuing that
[24:39] today um but if that first really talked
[24:42] about and ashamed this is one particular
[24:43] instance of this brother branham
[24:45] explicitly states at the end time there
[24:47] will be people false anointed ones who
[24:49] will have supernatural signs associated
[24:51] with him and they will be completely
[24:52] anointed of the devil
[24:54] so you'll have a whole lot of people who
[24:56] believe the message
[24:58] only because there's some supernatural
[25:00] associated with it
[25:02] and then as soon as they come in contact
[25:03] with someone who's completely anointed
[25:05] with the devil who can also have
[25:06] supernatural signs associated with them
[25:08] where are they then
[25:10] i mean at the end of the day
[25:13] brother brandon was very clear um if you
[25:15] also want to hear the uh see some more
[25:17] about this um
[25:18] i don't have time to pull the quotes uh
[25:20] right now because i'm
[25:22] only got a couple minutes left but
[25:24] um uh read or listen to spoken words
[25:27] original seed it is six hours long but
[25:29] it is very good um there's actually he's
[25:32] got one of my absolute favorite quotes
[25:33] in there if you have anybody in the
[25:34] ministry where he says um i'm gonna
[25:36] preach for another 20 more minutes and
[25:38] then we'll close and then he preached
[25:39] another four hours um
[25:42] he um
[25:43] so uh he did the absolute ultimate i'm
[25:46] about to close
[25:47] no one will ever beat it um
[25:50] and uh
[25:51] but
[25:52] in there he says over and over and over
[25:54] again repeatedly there will be people at
[25:56] the end who are so close to the very
[25:58] elect it will deceive the very elect if
[26:00] it were possible and he says there we
[26:03] expect there to be supernatural
[26:05] associated with it
[26:06] expect it
[26:07] and
[26:08] because it will be so close to the very
[26:10] elect the he said the only the only
[26:15] actual way to know the difference is to
[26:17] put them to the word test
[26:19] because every seed brings forth of its
[26:21] own kind
[26:23] right what is god saying there in the
[26:25] book of genesis when he says every seed
[26:26] will bring forth of its own kind what
[26:27] are you saying every
[26:29] dna
[26:31] will
[26:32] replicate
[26:33] what it's supposed to replicate right
[26:35] every we we can show that dna that's a
[26:39] type of the word of god in biology right
[26:41] it's what it is every every every letter
[26:43] has to be identical every letter has to
[26:45] be the same you get one letter off you
[26:46] get a disaster right you put them to the
[26:48] word test if they're one letter off from
[26:51] that original seed
[26:53] that god put down you know in the word
[26:56] you're gonna have a problem right it's
[26:58] gonna be off somewhere it's gonna it's
[26:59] gonna you might not see it right now
[27:02] but it'll show up somewhere
[27:04] a lot of times people have um genetic
[27:06] disorders right they had something
[27:08] damaged their genetics a lot of times
[27:09] actually inherited from their parents or
[27:11] grandparents
[27:13] um i believe it's things like um um uh
[27:16] parkinson's
[27:17] genetic disorder you don't know about it
[27:19] till you're 40
[27:20] unless you took the genetic test but
[27:21] you'll be a perfectly normal life until
[27:23] you're 40
[27:25] and then everything falls apart
[27:27] well
[27:28] it's what a lot of times people have
[27:29] spiritual parkinson's they got something
[27:32] right when they first came in contact
[27:34] with match of the hour they'll get the
[27:36] whole word except for a few small
[27:38] deviations
[27:40] and because they didn't get the they
[27:41] didn't rectify that soon enough it's
[27:44] somewhere in their foundation of their
[27:46] experience with god is a deviation and
[27:48] it'll be 40 years later and then bang it
[27:51] all falls apart
[27:52] why because the foundation there was
[27:55] some deviation somewhere in that word
[27:57] that they didn't rectify they didn't
[27:59] deal with
[28:00] and it's going to show up later
[28:03] um
[28:04] and so i am now
[28:06] officially a minute over so
[28:08] we'll end it there um and we'll stand
[28:10] and have a word of
[28:14] prayer father we thank you for this time
[28:17] that we would see you in our in the word
[28:18] and in the in the the natural things as
[28:21] well father we know that while
[28:24] climbing that tree of knowledge we may
[28:25] never be able to really know you by
[28:27] climbing the tree of knowledge we do
[28:29] know that we will be able to we can see
[28:31] you all over the tree of knowledge if
[28:32] we're starting with the tree of life
[28:35] and and we thank you father for all
[28:37] these the the beauty that you put into
[28:38] the world and within us we are fearfully
[28:41] and wonderfully made and even every
[28:43] single cell
[28:45] all the billions and billions that make
[28:47] each of our body inside of each and
[28:49] every one of them is a testament to you
[28:51] and to your word
[28:53] and we see that and we thank you for it
[28:54] father and we ask that you would
[28:57] be with us in the coming service father
[28:58] we would create an atmosphere of worship
