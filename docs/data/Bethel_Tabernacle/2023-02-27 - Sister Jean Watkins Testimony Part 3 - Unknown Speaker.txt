========================================

yeah how many with raise your hands recognize this picture do you know who it is it's brother Branham and the pillar of Fire I don't know why in 1964 God honored us privileged to sit in some of those meetings with brother Brown I can't I can't tell a lot that some people can tell like brother Eddie bisco's testimony is awesome but I want to share with y'all what what we did do and the first meeting we was in was in Birmingham Alabama and I think Ethan's got a picture back there we went to two meetings spiritual picture Ethan yeah that picture that's what Jason's face looked like you see it's red that's blood and we took him to the doctor he had eczema there's no cure for eczema not then not now so when we got to the meetings in Birmingham we wanted to have Jason prayed for and so my husband brother Eddie got a prayer card but unbeknownst to us brother Branham had already used the prayer cards so the first night he preached we heard was spiritual amnesia and when brother Brandon walked out on that platform now we come from a very small 30 40 people Church hundreds packed out all I could think was he speaks with such Authority I didn't even understand that I do now but it didn't then but I knew he spoke with such Authority so the next night which was Sunday he preached the trial and after he preached the trial then he called up all the ministers to line up and and including himself and the people passed through to be prayed for well brother Eddie had a prayer card but it wasn't any good and so we were disappointed but he went through the prayer line and he said when he got up to brother Branham brother Brandon pulled him up to him and said you believe don't you son he said yes sir I do nah we're very young Christians we're very young message Believers we're very young we weren't known or some of you kids sitting here at that time even though we married and had two kids so after that that was in April 1964. well our little church it you know Ashley back then there was very few message churches I mean we've got quite a few now but back then there were very few and the very few that there were was very small churches 30 40 people so the the pastor we was under was a real believer but he was limited so we were hungry we'll know more about this great thing God had done from the first time we heard it we believed it and it has been uh it's kept me all my life and I'm 82 years old it's kept me all my life and I was in my early 20s so my husband said we're moving to Jeffersonville we want to find out more about this and so we moved to Jeffersonville oh I I I forgot I was looking at his picture so when that was on Sunday Afternoon brother Eddie went through the prayer line well the next day was Monday when we got home my sister Connie and our cousin Brenda had kept Lisa and Jason at our home in North Carolina this was Birmingham Alabama and as soon as we walked in I seen he was healed and I said when did his face start getting better and she said yesterday for church it was bleeding you can see that that's not Jason but that's the way his face was it bled and she said but all of a sudden yesterday afternoon it got well God healed him when he went through that Jason Jason went I mean Eddie went through that prayer line so then that was in April and then in July we moved to Jeffersonville and we got there we found a little we only took our Essentials we found this little single wide trailer in his little trailer park and they let brother Eddie work to pay the rent give a little money until he could find a job he was a good worker he never had a problem finding a job so the first service we was in was Feast of the trumpets and dear and feast of the trumpets um Ethan are you showing the pictures honey that's that that picture was taken when we were on our way to Jeffersonville Indiana we stopped there and took them pictures that's Jason sitting up there and that's Lisa holding him so in July we moved to Jeffersonville and found that little trailer and then the first service we was in Feast of the trumpets and during Feast of the trumpets brother Sydney Jackson and his wife from South Africa were there and I believe brother Branham said they got baptized while they were there I'm I met I heard brother Sydney's testimony in person and it it was awesome so anyway brother Branham preached Feast of the trumpets so after Feast of the trumpets we sent word back home brother Brandon preached Feast of the trumpets there he is there no he did not preach Feast of the trumpets they're just young they don't know what they're doing they don't know what they're talking about we got to send somebody up there to find out what these kids he did not preach feasts of the trumpets so they said sister Gray and sister gray is an older sister become a lifelong friend a dear friend of ours and she come up there to investigate and what had happened brother Branham was scheduled that summer and he was in Jeffersonville that summer and that's the summer we were there he was going to Africa that was where his heart was if he could and if he couldn't then he was going to preach the seven trumpets Seven Nights and so they wouldn't let him into Africa an uprising some of the missionaries were killed so they wouldn't let him go amongst other things and um then he looked around to try to find a place to hold the Feast of the trumpets because the Tabernacle itself held about maybe 500 people and I mean crammed in there I don't know if you could got more in 500 or not Judy so maybe you know but anyway uh uh he he couldn't find a place to have it and he wondered why and he looked everywhere and then he prayed he said Lord why can't I not preach those feasts so that they were seven of them why can't I preach them I didn't get to go to Africa I told the people I'm going to preach them and the Lord revealed him they weren't for us they were for Israel the seals were for us so when he preached Feast of the trumpets he didn't preach Feast of the trumpets so we were right and the people found out yep he did just in one service so the next day sister Gray she's out riding around we're out riding around with her and she goes down Ewing Lane now Ewing Lane is is where brother Brown's house is even today that house is there beside his house his brother sister Banks Woods just big yard between them and she drove into the Woods's driveway she got out of the car we followed her and walked kind of around the back of the house and there was some sisters back there talking and fellas beautiful day and um so she began talking we kind of stood back and found out one of them was Sister Mita Branham and when we found out it was Sister Mita Branham we began telling her about Jason being healed in the Birmingham meetings that is Sister Mita and brother Branham and so anyway we told her all about that and the next service was recognizing your day and its message and if you go back on that tape brother Branham tells that he said there were some people there yesterday been in the Birmingham meetings at the Woods's house talking to Sister meeting them telling them about little children being healed that little children was Jason so that was just a blessing you know he didn't know our names he didn't know us but he told the story so then we were there when he preached future home if you've never heard future home it's one of my favorite it might be my favorite because it tells where we're who our future home is and I loved it we were there for that then then he we were there for proving his word I I can't remember just every little thing I know the first service we were there we we were on the right hand side of the church and we didn't know no anybody we were total strangers but we recognized brotherly Val when you brother leave hell we we had met him and we also saw brother way now brother way is the one that dropped dead with a heart attack while brother Brandon was preaching and you can hear it on tape where he drops dead and brother Branham goes out prays for him and he comes back to life brother Wade lived many many many years he lived to be a real old man and so God completely healed him then so we were there for proving his word and what happened at the Branham Tabernacle the you got two doors on the back some of you been there somebody haven't one door on each side double doors in the front so we always stood on the right except that I mean on the left and we were always early if you didn't get there early you didn't have a hope of getting a seat because it only held so many people we were always there early and we had two small children and we would stand there in line they kept the doors locked you couldn't go inside and we would stand there in line with other early people until time for the services and as we're standing there more and more people are coming I don't know how many because they're coming at every door and the door we're at more and more people you can hear people talk and you know how we all get together and talk and all like that and all of a sudden you hear foot footsteps coming in the Branham Tabernacle and when you hear them footsteps everybody gets quiet and then there's an excitement arising almost like Get Ready set go you you can feel the people are excited they're fixing to unlock the door we got to get inside excuse me these allergies are killing me but so when they unlock the door a tsunami of people took you in you didn't have to walk and I'm telling you you were in you didn't run around finding a seat you got the first seat you come to or you didn't get a seat now we were always early because we want it inside because we were always early we always grabbed the first seat we come to we always managed to get to see a lot of people didn't because on the car radio those that couldn't get in some of them stood outside the windows those that couldn't get in you could turn the car radio on and listen to brother Branham over over the pulpit preaching we never had to do that so anyway um during that time brother brother Branham greets brother Ed biscoll and his family I never knew brother biscal at that time and they were way over here and we were way over here so I couldn't see them years later we become we become acquainted with obiscals and the family and there to this day very dear friends Affairs and anyway the the chairs inside the Tabernacle I don't know how the schools are now but when I went to school you know your seats folded back like that and that's the way they were well we were all standing up I don't remember why and Lisa was four years old Curious you know that's the inside of the Branham Tabernacle and we were sitting over here on the on the left-hand side at that time and she couldn't see so she stood up on that chair and that chair flipped and she felt through years old oh my my kid she's going to be screaming holler we're gonna break her legs if we can even get her out you can imagine as mothers how you feel we got her out she didn't scream we got her out and she was fine something happened I believe it was during that meeting because that's where we were setting that I do remember we were setting on that on the left on the left hand side there brother Branham was speaking I I don't remember the the uh what he was saying I remember he was speaking and as he was looking out through the congregation he went like that caught my eye he went like that like somebody was calling him what's going on and he was looking dead at me I froze I I mean here's a pro I believed he was a prophet and and I froze and he was looking right at me like that and looking right at me and I thought now I cannot describe this maybe somebody can I can't brother Branham was very kind all of us know that that was kind of a sweeter humbler man in the world he didn't look mad he didn't look angry but it was God looking through them eyes I guess he was either looking at that pill or fire or discernment or something but when he looked back at me I cannot describe the look in his eyes they were piercing he done like that a couple times and what it was just a seat or two in front of me was a brother and brother Branham he was looking at him I thought he's looking at me and he said you're sitting there praying I'd speak to you weren't you I don't remember what he told the brother but he did tell him you were sitting there praying I'd speak to you and of course brother brother Branham did and so in the meantime uh brother Eddie's looking for work he couldn't find work and he finally found a job with a paint company that were a traveling painting company out of Wisconsin and they painted hair lines like they crawled up them with their buckets and they painted them and there's another picture Ethan there that's what he that's the job he got he said he could feel when they crawled out on him arms he could feel the electric uh pulling there's on his arm but he was a good worker so he kept the job in the meantime though brother Branham was there then he done questions and answers and we were there for that and then brother Branham left and went I think he had to take the children back to Tucson for school but also he had other commitments to go to and I remember one of one of the questions and answers there's four of them um I don't think we knew it uh well let me get this first when Eddie got the job once that job was finished it it traveled and they moved to Elizabethtown Kentucky about 50 miles from Jeffersonville so we moved to Kentucky and while we were in Kentucky we met a young couple and they went to Brother Hoover's church now brother Hoover brother Brandon was a friend of brother Hoover and priests in his church I think he even dedicated his church and we did visit brother Hoover's Church on the weekends we'd go to Jeffersonville it's about 50 miles and um so anyway one of the questions and answers we were there in I don't think we knew brother Branham was going to do it I recently listened to him he didn't even know they were going to do it so but anyway when we got there of course we didn't get there early enough to get in but we got in the foyer in the four year in the Branham Tabernacle there's two openings into the sanctuary and we were over here I could see brother Branham in the pulpit and I could hear him uh and as he was answering questions now brother Brown took questions and answers very serious he always answered a question if he could and these particular questions he wanted to know what's on the people's heart more than biblical questions more like personal questions and one of the one of the questions I'll just name three of them one of the questions that they asked him and and what he said he said now this question to this person this is important to them as yours is to you so the question was brother Branham is women's pajamas the same as men's garments and you can see it in the Cod book He said I really don't know he said that as as a Christian sister you basically you decide them things yourself and he kept talking he said you know I don't really unless you want my thoughts on it he said now if you want my thoughts on it I'll give you my thoughts on it I think a nightgown is nice oh but he answered one question Jason Dale Ashley with that a lot today in his sermon it's a very important question I love God in Simplicity God has made it so simple brother Branham how can I love the Lord more read the word and pray that is so simple and it works it pays off I seen him get a question he didn't answer it's kind of funny because he answered every question like if it was a personal question like a man and a wife or something he'd say I see on personal interviews he answered every question and brother Neville I guess brother Capps was a song later then someone was sitting behind him and now also brother Branham said that some of those questions you know he'd get them and look at them beforehand but some of them just come in right then and I guess this had been one of them brother Branham is looking down at this question it stuns him uh brother Branham is it okay for women to shave their legs thank you did I read that right do they do that that was history it's almost like he jumped did I read do they do that he just laid that question [Laughter] um brother Branham was I had a real that I laugh about I don't know about brother Brandon he had a very good sense of humor brother Branham did but anyway um then then he was gone that was 64. and then in the meantime job we got traveled so he was in Elizabethtown Kentucky and we'd go back to forth to Jeffersonville on the weekends and then they moved us to Oklahoma we were in Ada Oklahoma Bristol Oklahoma uh Oklahoma Oklahoma City Muskogee Oklahoma Pryor Oklahoma and we would be at those places just brief you know now the foreman of that of that job had his own big truck and pulled his own little home behind him he had two children a wife and two children but we would just find a little place we never had a problem finding we probably wouldn't know we didn't then and so as soon as we get into a place first thing we'd do is find a little Pentecostal Church and when we had found a little Pentecostal Church then we'd witness the message to him and about brother Branham and and then they'd move us on some of the places was only there very brief we wound up in Muskogee Oklahoma in the bitter cold winter blizzard I think we even had a blizzard when we were there and we lived in an apartment I guess about a third I'm thinking about the third floor and we went to a little Pentecostal church with brother and sister Bogman they were an older couple they really they really liked us we really liked them we went to their little church while we were there and witnessed this message to them they never rejected it never but they didn't embrace it either unless they did after we left and so during that time in Muskogee out down the hall with other apartments and I met this girl named Kathy Brown she had two little children her husband's name was Cherokee Brown I don't know if he was Indian but his name was Cherokee Brown never met him and so witnessed her and one night in the dead of winter in Muskogee Oklahoma we got a knock on the door and it's Kathy wanting to go out and get baptized pitch black bitter coal in the middle of winter don't know where you're at or where you're going we're new there and Eddie thinks he found a dam of some sort and so we pulled up to it no flashlight no nothing and him and her walked out didn't even know what kind of water they were walking out in and he baptized her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and right after that then they sent us then to Pryor Oklahoma Rebecca knows a little bit about this and we met brother Everett and sister Lorraine Thornton their children Pam Deb Debbie and Steve and we just fell in love with him and they did us too and so while we were there we witnessed the message to him we told him about brother Branham they never rejected it never did reject it they didn't embrace it either or they didn't embrace it at that time eventually they did so and I think Rebecca's kin some way in a little bit to him husband I believe it is Rebecca Dave Musgrove yeah and uh so anyway we were there and then they sent us to Beaumont Texas Perry green was still pastoring a church in Beaumont Texas at that time and when we got there now all we had was these big reel-to-reel tape recorders and I think we had one tape let me tell you the books weren't out then the books to come out I think around 68 if I'm not mistaken the film was showing brother Branham brother Perry green found that film around 70 or the early 70s we didn't have we had that's what we had and it was hard to come by the the reel-to-reel takes they broke real easy too but brother Perry had a bunch of them and he would loan them to us he also made copies for us and we sent those copies to brother Thornton and as time went on then brother brother Perry felt led to go to Tucson Arizona and start a message Church there was no message church in Tucson Arizona at that time excuse me he wanted us to go with him he offered to pay our way to support us till brother Eddie found a job we considered it especially brother Eddie considered him and um brother Perry I believe brother Perry left about the first week of November uh seemed like it was around the first week of November then you're coming up to the last of November Thanksgiving and um brother Brown's going to be in Shreveport Louisiana no we all that we listen to the tapes or read the books no brother Branham went regularly to Shreveport Louisiana to Jack Moore's Church Jack Moore as far as we know never embraced the message but he embraced brother Brandon he loved brother Branham and brother Branham felt free to preach there kind of like his own church well we wanted to go so we had met some good friends Joyce and Harley Duty they went to Brother Perry's church in Beaumont Texas when brother Perry went to Arizona he left that little church in the care of his daddy brother green we got to go to Shreveport when we got to Shreveport Shreveport is on a hill I um if any of y'all have ever been in this report it's hilly so we really didn't know where to go except we we knew the name and all like that well when we got there we looked down the hill and we we saw a bunch of people down there going into a building and we thought it must be where brother Brown's going to be preaching so we went down there and I asked him no brother Brennan was not preaching there it was Billy Graham by way of film they were had a film of Billy Graham they were all going to see so we headed back up the road uh maybe someone told us look another Direction and then at the top of the road uh there was a red light and it and it stopped us but right in front and the road then went like this and we were sitting like this road like this and up on a hill was a big church and down there on that roadway was a bunch of limousines I don't remember if I even counted them at least three four five limousines or more sitting there on that roadway and as we're sitting there under the red light the church door opens and a bride and groom comes out by themselves that's very strange I mean fully dressed white dress and everything that's odd come down the steps because it was a lot of steps come down to the drive to the road he put her in one of those limousines shut the door and he went back in the church isn't that odd so then we finally found brother Jack Moore's church and when we did I think it's a big church it was packed out we couldn't get in the sanctuary we got in the church maybe the basement I'm not sure I could hear Brother Brown very clearly but I couldn't see him so we might have been in the basement after service was over we run into brotherly Vale sister Vale and we had become pretty good friends with them at that time and they invited us to their motel room for little Fellowship so we went and as we were there talking to brother and sister Vale um We Begin telling them about Billy Graham and the bride and groom and and he looked at us he said you know brother branham's right above me in the room above me I'll take y'all up and introduce you to him I mean we're in our early 20s you we're not sick we sick people have to go dead people need raise we're no so we wouldn't go but there was another main reason we didn't go when we were brand new in the message brotherly fell went to Charlotte to brother Albert Green's church a little small Church brother Henry Green's brother we went down there to hearing that's how we met brother Vale and uh while we were traveling we didn't have a home Church we visited churches we did not have a home church we sent him our tithes he he was not a pastor at that time he helped brother Branham a lot in his campaigns very good Muslim friend of brother Branham and it shocked him that we sent him our ties it shocked him and he said nobody did that but that's who we knew and we didn't know nobody else and we had a lot of confidence and loved him we sent him our ties we had him at our house in Texas but one thing he and that's him with brother Branham one thing he said at the Charlotte meetings he said a lot of people want to get to know me and be my friends just to meet brother Brown and me and brother Eddie made a promise to each other If We Ever Meet brother Branham won't be through brotherly fell so he we couldn't let him introduce us but apparently he tells brother Branham about that because on the wings of a snow white dove brother Branham tells that he tells the only thing is he brother Branham just got the story of brother but he was a brother and a sister I was with him so excuse me and uh he tells the brother Branham tells that and he tells how that bride and groom comes out of that church he's relating our story to brother Branham and he said that meant a lot to him it was complimentary to his to his to his ministry it was kind you can read that in the wings of a snow white dove it was very complimentary to his ministry and the Very night we was there he preached invisible Union of the bride and here we saw bride I can see while that was complimentary to brother Branham well that was Thanksgiving the last of November then December the 18th now December the 18th we're still in Beaumont Texas we've got to settle down Lisa's five she's got to go to school the next year so we got to decide brother Perry's wanting us to move out there we didn't really know and then uh then on December and we didn't have phones you didn't have your little cell phones you had a house phone you didn't have a phone and of course we're traveling you don't have a house phone we didn't have the books only tapes we had was what we got from brother brother Perry so we you're getting information little by little not like you do now December the 18th brother Brown was in a serious car wreck most you know that I don't know about you young people it was a head-on collision there were young boys drinking driving going from one side of the road to the other and just as brother Branham come by they went to his side they had a hard time getting brother Branham out of the car sister Branham was hurt really bad Sarah had a back broke only Sarah was with him at the in the wreck and so they got Sarah and sister Branham to the hospital I had an awful time getting brother Branham out because his leg was wrapped around the steering wheel his upper body was laying out through the windshield out on the dash and according to what I read they had to take and and pull the car like this while Billy Paul got inside and pulled his dad and brother Brown never lost conscious according to what they what they say and being brother Perry was there a lot of people were there at the hospital in Texas brother Perry was a big spokesperson that if you knew brother Perry he there was much nothing he couldn't get done or do like I said he's the one that found the 20th century profit film that we've got well now we're getting little bits and pieces December the 18th he has a wreck I don't think we even knew it until the next day at church day one he's got the prophet he's going to be fine day two he's still in the hospital what you expect he's been in a bad car wreck but he's God's prophet and he's going to be okay I mean brother I I saw brother way raised from the dead lived many many years I knew people personally that was healed under his ministry including Jason I knew people that got deserma under brother branham's Ministry Scott's prophet day three day four and Eve then we're getting word his brain is swelling um he's gonna be okay his work's not through yet we got it all figured out we're all going to be here brother Brown's going to be with us and he's going to introduce us to Jesus Christ at the rapture so he's going to be okay day five just a greater miracle day six brother Branham used to sing his song you can hear it a lot on a lot of his sermons brother Brown I'm Always sung after a sermon but this one song in particular beautiful song I Love the song it's hard for me to hear that song my heart drops tears two we meet till we meet till we meet at Jesus feet [Music] with me [Music] till we meet God be you with you till we meet again [Music] and he was gone brother Branham was gone he's tired wore out weary servant was gone that came in here we have to have brother Brown he can't be gone we he can't be gone but he is and we had to come to terms with that we were stunned we were shocked the whole world that knew brother Branham was in shock now we're still young in the message and still learning we love it we believe it did did it did it weaken our faith and not one tiny bit nothing is ever weak in our faith I've Loved this I'm 82 years old I was in my early 20s I love it and I love the Lord Jesus for sin in it but he was gone God took him home brother Billy Paul told Brother Perry There's different ones there at the funeral at rather at Texas brother Perry take Daddy home so brother Perry arrangs to take brother Branham home to Coots funeral home now Coots was a good friend of brother brands then he arranged to get sister Mita and Sarah and I think Rebecca and George and I don't know who all else also get them home they were going for Christmas it was going to Jeffersonville from Arizona for Christmas so they got to Jeffersonville on December the 29th 1965. they had his funeral there are some of the cars that's his church sister Branham couldn't go sister brownham had a concussion her body was she was very injured Sarah had a broke back among other things so she couldn't go so after the funeral they took brother branham's body back to the Coots Funeral Home they didn't bury him they didn't know where to bury him he had home in Jeffersonville and God had moved him to Tucson several years before and he had a home out there where are we going to bury him a big decision there was only one person on the earth could could answer that and that was Mr meeda and she was not able to answer it at that time April the 11th 1966 they sister Mita decided we're going to bury him in Jeffersonville at Eastern Cemetery a lot of y'all have been there and that's about a block from the church matter of fact when we had funerals there we we did not go to Arizona we went back to North Carolina for a little while and then we went back to Jeffersonville we lived there for seven years and we're members of the Branham Tabernacle in that seven years Jason and Lisa and Nathan went to school there Jason went to school when Lisa too in that Parkview Junior High where brother Branham saw the Lord Jesus out there before they rebuilt it that's where Jason then went to school um so anyway they buried him in eastern Cemetery now I want y'all to look at this picture if any of y'all ever saw this picture I didn't know if any of y'all had or not this picture brother Perry green like I say back back then you didn't have a lot of information but if you got brother Perry had a lot of information but he was one of the few he sent us a whole album of brother branham's pictures this is one of the pictures now I only tell you what is what I what I was told I I can't all I know that's brother branham's casket that anointing never left that prophet and that was we were told was his casket and then they put up his uh Tombstone it's a pyramid a lot of you've seen it a lot of you haven't and it's it's got writings on on the pyramid um brother Brandon when he preached future home you know he took it out of the Bible that it it's it's on a mountain 1500 miles high it's a pyramid so they put up a pyramid so you've got that picture Matthew now I want y'all to look at that picture I wish I could have found a better one I couldn't you see that eagle that's a gold eagle y'all ever saw that before Now where's the other one Ethan see that go eagle its wings is up statues don't fly I guess you're wondering what's going on well I'm going to tell you what we were told when the seven years we went back there we were told this that was the first eagle someone stole it I don't think they ever found out where the eagle went who stole it they said it was a very valuable eagle and they replaced it with this one and then I want to brother Branham a couple years back before the Lord took him home and you know our thing was he can't this can't be brother Branham cannot be gone uh we've got all this figured out he's going to be here the Rapture he's going to introduce we didn't realize it but we do now we were in the rapture already and he did introduce us to the real Jesus Christ every time he preached that word every time he raised the dead and you know he raised several people from the dead every time he prayed for the sick or discerned he was introducing us to the real Jesus Christ we didn't recognize that then but we do now we had to learn and grow he went the the he he wondered what's on the other side of this veil of life we all live in and you all know beyond the curtain of time God took him there and then he saw these women coming with their white robes and the brothers coming with their white just one big Joy he didn't want to come back he didn't have a choice he had to come back for us I'm so glad he did he come back for us he don't have to come back anymore that's where he's at now that's where my husband brother Eddie is Sister seal sister Jan and different ones that we've lost over over time right here in our on in our on mist someone I don't know who it was made a video some of you saw it maybe or maybe not maybe a lot of you haven't they made this video it's called beyond the curtain of time and it's about three minutes long and I want to play this little video for y'all because if you wonder where brother branham's at that's where he's at where brother Eddie is that's where he's at

[Music] [Applause] what a time that we face just ahead of us friends it's never been more real to me than now I thought to myself that you know I would um you know before sister Jean started I had no idea I hadn't seen any of her material and and I thought well you know I want to have some questions but I don't think I have even one question Paul that was so thorough it was so wonderful I want to give her another hand amen I am I I can say literally that I am and will be uh I guess that's almost redundant I am eternally grateful for God's love and his Mercy to my family and revealing this wonderful truth to my mom and dad and that you know that uh that video uh what a day friends my you know we have not run in vain amen I you know the Bible talks about that that we will you know will not be ashamed would not be left holding the bag you're not going to end up with a short end of the stick brother Jack it's worth it amen just like Paul you know I think about my age and Mom and I think about the Apostle Paul saying you know I've I've come to the end I've run my race I'm ready to go on and there's not just a crown of righteousness for me but for all them who love is appearing my I uh you know starting from with sister Gene to me to all of you we we have loved his appearing yes amen I want to thank you all for being here today does anybody have a direct question you'd like to ask sister Jean about it's okay if you don't but if you do I want to give you the opportunity amen praise the Lord Oh Brother Rich when we went back the seven years that we lived there he's the one that started printing the books you said 68 I was thinking like the books maybe were around I think they had some Publications but the books were maybe around 70. no we were in Dallas oh yeah and you were getting them already wow how you like that praise the Lord so we're glad for that any others go ahead brother Young I was in I was in Texas the car crash was in Texas but I was in Beaumont Texas I forget the town that the wreck happened what's the first time you all remember being back at the Tabernacle after he passed away when we moved up there yeah yeah and we moved up there around 1970. yeah we were there for seven years and um I'm gonna tell you something of the seven years we were there it made me we it's hard to put in words I appreciated even brother Branham Moore if that's crazy to say that because I saw the way they lived I saw the way the church was conducted I saw the way his children were they were just like the rest of us and but they they were some real true Believers and I've got acquainted with the Branham family I was a close friend with Rebecca and George I used to sing with Rebecca and another sister so it was a great honor and I sung in the Branham Tavern I'll tell you one little story that I froze me I would not sing behind the pulpit but but I I was singing solo over here by the piano with a microphone and it was not working and brother Collins and brother Phillips were sitting behind me motioned me to brother Brown's pulpit no I looked at them I saw them what do you do when the preacher tells you to go over and sing behind the Brethren Brown's pool right you do whatever no question just do it I felt I felt it was the honor was to I tell you Mom that's a great honor there's another story I've never heard on my life praise the Lord Brother uh brother Michael Collins that's what he remembered most about you as you and Rebecca and Anna Anna singing yeah they called him the Tabernacle Trio amen praise the Lord I I that I didn't expect sister Gene to sing that song for me I about lost it but I grew up my whole life hearing her singing and I think she's still a magnificent singer amen God bless you let's bow our heads any other questions before we go any other uh brother Jonathan [Music] might be the other way around yeah yeah amen so it's uh you know but the Bible talks about that you know the gift on Timothy uh that it came through his grandmother Eunice down to his mother Lois and into him and uh you know I I loved brother Eddie for a lot of the characteristics I got and uh all the Watkins men love those Watkins jeans but but uh but my preaching ability my gift and it really came through sister Gene and that's a straight up fact just like Timothy in the Bible so if I'm glad I got that scripture so I can lean on that amen all right any others before we go sister Kathy oh who was it sister you had a question okay all right okay okay good deal all right let's pray father we thank you once again Lord we've come to the conclusion of this Lord and I wow I don't I don't think we could ever have enough time to talk about these things Lord and there's others that could you know could take it from there and you know say when I came and to this day and I've been a Believer and the Lord's did this and that and I think we'd all have that testimony Lord one thing's for sure we we absolutely father are convinced the realities of the Living God move Among Us so it how could it not be the truth Lord when we see the realities of the Living God everything the word promised for the bride in this day we see it moving among us we only want more of it Lord we just desire more and more of it so I commit it to you I thank you for this record this this true record and this true testimony from Sister Gene your daughter my mother Lord we're looking forward to that day when we're all together again then we'll we'll sit around and and tell the great things that God did for all of us down through time we come it now to you Lord I pray it'll be a great impact upon the young people that really was the burden of her heart Lord for the senior youth so father may may it have a lasting may it reap dividends for many ages many years to come Lord into the Eternal ages we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen God bless you friends thank you God bless you dismissed
