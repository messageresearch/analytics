went right back to I remember Mom saying a lot of the songs that she wrote it was like in a service while while someone was preaching and or she was going through something and the way that she sung it was an expression of the spirit in which she she it was written and so I started thinking about this song and knowing mom's history you know she was going through different things in her life and I was like man this was an actual praise song for Mom this wasn't or really a worship song this here was a praise where she was giving thanks for what already was done when you start listening to the

I tell you I I seem like I've felt tired all day and I walked in the back office and just as soon as I walked in the door I started feeling better I said man I am at church praise the Lord amen so we've got some sick requests we're going to take to the Lord here just in a little bit let's have a little bit from the word of God Philippians chapter 1 amen amen and amen we're continuing tonight hopefully to a conclusion of this thought on precious in thy sight this will be the third installment and I want to pick up where we finished off last time with these two verses Philippians 1 and we're going to catch verses 20 and 21 amen your hearts ready for the word amen praise the Lord Philippians chapter 1 and verse 20 and 21 according to my Earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain amen let's pray Master we thank you for your word now tonight and Lord many hours Lord have been spent on this ser series and I'm feel that we're coming to this last part tonight and Lord I think it's as important a part as either of the first two Lord how much we have enjoyed the word of God on this thought now I'm asking tonight Lord that you take the remainder of this material Lord it is very close to my heart and father we have laid before you and salt your face on how to go through it Lord I want to cover it all so I pray Lord that you'll give me the right kind of mind and heart that can complete the assignment tonight and make it real lord to the people father we commit it to you in jesus' name amen God bless you as you are seated amen now I want to read that 20th verse uh one more time and uh if you'll put that up for me please that 20th verse one more time according and because last time after we read it from our King James Bible I read it to you from Eugene Peterson's translation called the message and it was so impacting I want to read it again verse 21st from our scriptures according to my Earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death Peterson says it this way I don't expect to be embarrassed in the least on the contrary everything happening to me in this jail only serves to make Christ more accurately known regardless of whether I live or die they didn't shut me up they gave me a platform form alive I'm Christ's messenger dead I'm his prize life versus even more life I can't lose I love that life versus more life choose it's okay you can't lose amen you know and and I I was pointing out and and then of course that 21st verse that was a real really that was coming from Paul's heart this was a conclusion that Paul had come to after many years of suffering persecution hardship nakedness hunger want uh at times you know almost given up for dead and he he lists out many things that he had been through and uh you know it's uh I I appreciated brother Chris Kathy's sermon on Sunday because I thought my goodness I got another one uh like brother Eddie so you know when brother Eddie was around because he had such a tough childhood and his dad you know run off no good you know in the world drinking abusing his mother same thing as brother Chris and uh and really wasn't hardly in their life and brother Eddie you know from the just a boy at 10 years old he's working in the cotton field just from a young boy he's having to help support his mother and siblings and you know I whenever I would get somebody in my back office who would have too much of a s story too much of a pity party what is brother jeel wowy wowy woo that's brother ju's statement uh I would just say sit right here and I'd go get brother at is Dad I need you to do that thing and he knew what that meant and he would come back there and just start talking about his life and you could see right away that person closed down their pity party they were they weren't ready to to to you know um cry like that anymore because they realize and so when brother Chris was talking about I mean that was a powerful sermon but I said you know brother Chris what made it so relevant is your testimony behind it because that's incontrovertible nobody can challenge your testimony because it happened to you you were there you see and so you know the the hardship that he went through and the way that he came up as a child and and you know through abuse and broken home and living in shelters as a boy and still come to this message even after his father fought tooth and nail to keep him away from it but he had a righteous grandmother amen amen praise the Lord amen I'm glad that my grandchildren have righteous parents but they also have a righteous grandparent amen praise the Lord and I'm speaking of sister Debbie and amen they know amen and she is uh she is UN she is she is tireless in her stand and when they get left of Sinner they know they have to face mamal and mamal well youall know how opinionated sister well I mean you know how you know how you know how plain sister Debbie speaks amen amen I pray her internet died just now but but uh the grandkids all know what that's like uh they don't want to have to face mama if she's got a problem so uh but they also know the love that comes from it and so brother Chris you know he was he had that same testimony that his grandmother you know and she got him to church and gave him books and then he you know went into the Marines and and the and the Lord got a hold of his life amen and so I just so appreciated somebody that has come through almost in impossible odds almost like insurmountable like Paul and yet is still a Believer and not only a Believer but a stronger one am you know I was just talking with a a sister recently about trials that we go through and you know she was saying to me and a member of my family very close to my trial and at times when I just you know you sometimes you get to the point where the disappointment can almost you can't breathe it just can take your breath away it's so crushing and yet I had the same testimony as her and I said you know and she had the same testimony we would not take back one of those trials now let's be honest none of us would have went through them had we seen ahead of time the Lord said I need you to go through this that's okay pass amen Lord I don't need to be that spiritual but you know Paul is speaking here and he's coming to a conclusion about life yeah so it's a big topic so this is why we've titled this series precious in thy sight life should be precious to you and there's only one life worth living and that's the one Paul found and that's the one he's preaching and he Paul was very careful that this topic of life and what it took for you to achieve it was so important to St Paul that he warned every other preacher uh to Infinity make sure you don't don't change what I'm saying make sure that just as I preach how the people can get to life don't you alter it you build right on top of my foundation and don't change anything don't move the ancient landmarks of the word how many appreciate a restored full word in this hour so Paul had paid a high price I think that a man who has paid a high price he has the right to have some audacity I think that a man who has labored and went through it and and walked through the fire and stood for the people he has a right to say things not only a duty and and a love but he has a right and and I and I think as the family of God you know when I look back at what this first prophet to the first age went through and I went and I see what the last prophet to the last age went through I just say those men had had a right to indict an evil generation those men had a right to tell me how to live those men have a right to tell me how to get home those men have a right to tell me I can't get there myself and I can't figure it out and I'm going to have to come God's provided way or I won't get there so when it comes down to it Paul was showing that it is Christ and it is the Life of Christ that really gives meaning to life this is where he ended last time Christ is what gives meaning to life and that's what that having that Revelation uh and the meaning that comes with it is what causes people to serve him even in hard times even all the way through hard times even all the way to the maximum hard time the ultimate P the ultimate sacrifice the laying down of your life and being willing to die for the cause of Christ now ours isn't so much that we have to give our lives ours is that we strive in our lives against the God of this evil age against Satan's Eden that's why brother Brenham said there in the church age book speaking of the martyrs and then comparing and contrasting to our day against their day and he said to speaking of the reward to some their reward is because they have given meaning their lives and they love not their lives unto death so some are rewarded in that they have given others meaning you and I in that we have striven so I'm here to tell you something friends get used to this reality god holds tantamount the striving that you go through with the physical death of what they went through am I would dare say you need the holy ghost in your life and you need every morning a fresh a fresh dying you need his mercies to be new every morning I know I do see and so it all comes down when you realize that life is precious then we ought to hold it as precious because you know this whole sermon title precious in thy sight was me up early one morning thinking about the goodness of God thinking about how I should have he should have never kept with me thinking how I should have long ago been kicked to the curb think how I should have been a hopeless case oh but there was Grace Hallelujah if it not if not for Grace friends where would I be oh where would I be if not for grace and so I would say to you this evening that the Lord Jesus Christ has invested quite a bit in you he's kept you and preserved you to this hour kept you a Believer when it's really impossible to be oh it's too dark it's too perverted it's too Twisted you would never survive it if we didn't have the message of the hour the opening of the word you'd never be able to recapture the token abstract for your life the church ages would never have given it to you it couldn't give it to them there had to be a restoration of all things so it gives meaning to our life so then we constantly have been asking you the question what's precious to you is the word precious is it now really see that's talk is cheap but do you demonstrate in your life to the Lord that his word is precious to you and that this gospel is dripping with blood do you hold it sacred do you value it am you see and and so you can say well that's how I feel in my heart and humanly speaking I'm not saying you're wrong or even mistaken or even lying or anything you might believe that about yourself but you also might have too high an opinion of yourself and if you look in the mirror of God's word you might really see that what the word says you remember you remember when in Snow White when the wicked witch she wanted to be lied to she's really an old hag but she wanted the mirror to show her she was beautiful this won't do that this is not a magic mirror it will tell you the truth about you and the only thing you can do when you look in the mirror and say God have mercy help me let me have a fresh surrender that a surrender yesterday oh I need it today I need it again and again our lives ought to be sincere before God and humble before God you only get that way through prayer and through dedication the more you can dedicate your life the stronger you become and then the more you can dedicate it which then you the stronger you become so it comes through doing it comes through the exercise of your faith amen you can't look for God to just push you through a pipe or put you in a cookie cutter he doesn't have cookie cutter family we all go through different things it's because and and your trials may not be like mine but on the other side I don't you don't and I don't know what we'll be but he does and whatever I'm Happening Here is getting me ready for there amen so so just look at it like that and then just you know just tell the devil you don't matter but because you say well he says well you know I got I I'll give you this disease I'll kill you for for me to live as Christ and to die you're threatening me with death a man who's not afraid to die are you telling a joke uh to me to live is Christ and to die is gain see so we we realize brother brandham you know I I I want to catch this uh in Philippians 3 please um brother Josh from Philippians 3:13 and 14 Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do I love this verse because I find my up and down life right here Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do for forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press that means like a strain you're stretching you're reaching see I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling there's a prize there's a high calling of God in Christ Jesus you say what does that even mean a prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus God can live through you what greater prize would you want I mean do you realize all the famous people in the world who have a million times a million times the amount of money you got who hold leadership positions in the world that you will never hold who have who are famous around the world can't even go up the street without getting mobbed who this life is the only life they will ever know and when they're gone from memory you will still be living I would say that the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus is a pretty valuable prize to be striven for verse 20 for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we seek for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body thank God that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself I'm glad he can brother brandham I'm going to give you this these these three statements here three different um actually there's four and and there's in they're in chronological order because I want I want you to see brother branham's as it's continuing to unfold to him he starts saying it in 1953 and he says it again for the fourth time in 1963 but he starts in Elijah in 1953 and he says the American people want to be entertained when they get a preacher that's in 1953 he's already saying this if he's not a good Entertainer to have socials and things like that are carrying on they don't want him and they vote him out of it they want to be entertained but God don't send entertainers he sends preachers see he sends preachers of the Gospel to preach the unadulterated gospel of Christ the power of his resurrection and every man that believes and accept it is born again outside of that you're lost and the nation will be lost he comes in 1955 two years later almost two years exactly about too much shy it a little less he says in the message the same Jesus tonight when the Holy Ghost overshadowed her speaking of Mary when the holy ghost overshelf in her womb now he's about to make a statement that the world will be judged by he says when the Holy Ghost over shattered her and put a blood cell in her womb God the Creator made that and that came to be the Son of God Amen here he says it again outside of believing that you're lost doesn't matter what you do he says all you could do it none of that would matter it's it's you have to believe that in order to be saved to believe what that Jesus Christ was the son of God that it was a blood cell created by the spoken word of God no part of Mary or Joseph at all he was man plus he was the god man see now watch he's going to keep ex extending his understanding now a year later 1956 God's Covenant with Abraham and his seed and the blood cell comes from the male and the male produced the blood cell and the male this time was a supernatural being which could not have sexual desire and God the Creator created a blood cell in the womb of Mary that brought forth the son Christ Jesus you believe it outside of that you're lost if you don't believe that there's not a way in the world for you to be saved see now I'm not I'm not trying to overthrow what brother Brandon made the statement in the in the at the at the in the Millennium the Heathen will be raised up to who never heard the gospel to get a chance God's fair and Equitable in all things you can't accuse him of Injustice so he's got a plan for all that and I'm not here to preach on that I'm just here to tell you God's got it all right so so don't question it whatever you do don't question it and and all right so so then now he comes to 1963 Christ is the mystery of God revealed one of the most epic sermons in his entire Ministry you almost have to hear it 10 times I've probably heard it 10 times 10 times trying to catch all of it and he says and to be sure that the whole Rapture now is that an important topic to you amen the whole Rapture now Luther was apart Wesley was apart the prophets was apart in the Revelation that they was making up the body the feet the toes the arms and so forth until the head see now we're coming into our time until the head see that makes the entire Rapture it's the body of the word that is such a statement it's the body of the word which is ch Christ amen now I'm going to get ahead of myself but I'm I'm not able I'm not allowed to not do it because I'm being anointed to do it so I'm gonna maybe just catch this one point I might make it again Sunday when you when you look at the pyramid that we have put up many times and I didn't do a PowerPoint tonight intentionally because it's Wednesday but but when you look at that and you see that Pyramid has no cap in the then the cap is coming down and actually the cap it Stone itself is a pyramid and it's got to come down and fit and brother brandham said that's what the gospel is doing it's honing the church if it's speaking of the individual it's adding faith and virtue knowledge and Temperance what is that doing it's honing you to fit not him to fit you he ain't changing he's God he changes not it's it's honing you it gets more and more narrow as it comes and the world has to get cut off of you so that you get to a point where the Capstone can come down see now you'll even notice in the middle when brother brandham has it there's a there's a there's a space and you say well well what is there well here's what we know brother brandham had already taught us that we have a uniting time and sign amen so we already know by prophecy that that was upon us it is the uniting time and sign and the and the sign of the son of man was a sign to the world that the uniting of Christ and his church is coming back to the fullness again just like it was in Paul's day when Paul was writing this you're now coming you could just as easily be sitting hearing Paul preach when you're hear hearing the message of the hour and so you say well so so I know that the Capstone I'm not waiting on a on a on a a uniting we already have the uniting time and sign so the only thing so now that's why we're not looking for some great Big Revival coming brother Bram said I'm not looking for Revival I'm looking for the coming of the Lord see he's just got to revive what we already know that's what the third pool's about it's finally making the word live you say well I don't see anything in between there you know why you don't see anything in between there that's uniting the top to the bottom because that uniting is invisible it's the it's the invisible Union and in fact is no one would know what it took to do that had brother brandham not written in that space Holy Ghost Holy Spirit now he's not saying that's where you get born again he's saying that the same God that started the church is the same one who's finishing the church and it's a uniting time and sign and the word is becoming flesh again and it's an invisible thing to the world they don't see it but we see it we know what it is so brother brandham comes here and Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he says I'm going to read it again the whole Rapture Luther's apart Wesley's apart prophets are apart Revelation they were making up the body feet toes arms and so forth until the head makes the entire Rapture it's the body of the word which is Christ hang on to that statement amen it's the body of the word which is Christ so in the beginning was the word and the word be was with God and was God and then became a body so it went from an invisible Spirit into a pillar of fire logos and that was the logos and that was the word and then that logos later became a body and that was now the word made flesh you see and so the life of that word when we talk about the word please don't limit in your mind that the message is just a restoration of Doctrine and Gifts you you thought it was just Doctrine and Gifts it's a restoration of a uniting life it's listen it's the the life of the logos that's the life you bypassed because of the fall but that's also the life you're now being restored back to hallelujah we're being restored back to that life that was in God and Christ was the first of that creation he's the beginning of it and now the whole family she is him she's the continuation of him in expression what that's why I say to you and that's why we plead with you make Christ first put this message as Central let it be your whole life sell out to It Lock Stock and Barrel it's the only thing of any value you it's the only thing that's going to survive so he says it's the body of the word meaning it's coming into human beings which is Christ you say uh Jesus wait a minute don't just think of the Nazarene remember he's the beginning of an expression God he was the god man he was man plus and so so this is why exactly we find the Bible saying that the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of Our Lord that's Jesus and his Christ that's his body that's the whole pyramid that's the whole life restored and you're going to get a body like Paul said liken unto his glorious body oh it's a uniting time and sign friends in visible to the world it's an invisible Union but it's just as real they don't see they don't see the logos in you any more than they saw it in Jesus they sure didn't they called him Beelzebub pretty sure they didn't think he was the logos embodied see so now he says that makes the entire Rapture it's the body of the word which is Christ here it is again outside of that you're lost I don't care how good you are or what your relationship is or what your fellowship is or what your organization is you're lost outside of that word being in you you're lost outside of that word being in you not you're lost out you know but you're okay as long as you're sitting in a message Church you're lost unless that word is in you that it comes here with you and leaves here with you and it goes to work tomorrow what does the word when you're in a crisis in public and you got a situation are you on display or is the word on display when you got conflict in your home sibling rivalry or or marital stress you know who's on display you are Christ I'm sure you know which one is supposed to be so he and he ties that back to the scriptures he's making the point I don't care how good you are what your relationship or fellowship or what organization you're lost outside of that word being in you and he goes to the scripture to prove it if ye abide in me if if if if ye abide in me see the word my word abide in you then he goes then you shall ask what you will do you know why because now you're operating the prize the mark for the prize of the high calling and so then it's then then you ask what you will because you and the word are the same well what does that look like brother Jason I'm glad you asked that brother bram's got an answer for you here's what here's what makes that up he has the nothing more you see the rest of the people living the way they do but yet you do not do it you're a prisoner you're yoked with him and he says my yoke is easy yoked with Christ with the word you are or you are not we talk about oh overcoming and the ingredients of overcoming and what it takes to be an overcomer I want to say to you tonight that the that the giving of yourself unreservedly to the Lord is an ingredient of overcoming in fact is I would suggest to you it's one of the main ingredients there you you're going to bake a cake there's all kinds of flavors and Seasonings and things you might put in it but there's some main ingredients that if you don't add them it won't be a cake so the giving of yourself unreservedly to the Lord is a main ingredient because you are the manifested word of this day that's what you're supposed to be a a manifestation of the Revelation that is in him all the world listen it's it's it's all the word that makes up his mystery that's what you are yeah amen living you see because it's a mystery and the people read right over it but it's they can't understand it they can't decipher it and neither can you and it's not about a prophet coming and deciphering symbolism and increasing your theology which the message does but that's not what it's really about it's really about coming off the page and living behind skin you become the mystery of all all that he is in the word I mean if you if if that's not true then he can never be just to condemn this world because the world could say well even your family couldn't be that you put too much on us like Cain said my burden is greater than I can bear you're putting too much on me and that would be the defense they would use but I'm here to tell you they will not have a defense because this word is becoming flesh and this and all those who love it who hold it precious will say this is the most valuable thing that I will ever have in my life everything else takes second third and fourth and fifth behind it nothing is up here with the word nothing's even equal to the word be living in my life and me doing whatever I need to do to be thaten that's why I said the giving of yourself unreservedly to the Lord is a major ingredient see so we are a continuation this is uh this is the prophecy that he gave in Genesis 1 128 be fruitful and multiply this is the continuation of that Jesus said Jesus I mean in Matthew I I'm sorry in Genesis when in chapter 3 when they came to God I think it's verse 21 when they came and they had fig leaves and the Bible says God gave them skins see which means he slew a lamb and gave them bloody skins now that the the innocent life of that lamb couldn't come back on them because they were human so the only way an innocent lamb could come back on a human is the Lamb of God would have to be a human am so when he started it in Genesis 3 Jesus said I have come to finish I've come to finish his work that he started back there and I'm going to give my life a ransom for many oh friends do you love him like we ought to tonight is he the most precious thing that you're involved in this and that he has revealed this and you're a part of it Hallelujah so it's the life in the logos the life that we bypassed in the fall the life that's being restored and you thought it was just doctrines and Gifts brother brandham says in Jubilee year this is a very touching quote Chris and I were rejoicing over this said if we ever get to go there we want to do the same thing brother brandham says when I stood that down there in San Angelo catacombs and looked laying there all along for a mile nearly under the ground I've seen pictures of it probably you have to under the ground Graves where they'd have to bury their dead he's talking about these churches back in the day the the True Churches the your brothers and sisters who had to meet secretly down in the tombs CU authorities wouldn't go down there it was hooky and spooky and they wouldn't go down there a bunch of dead dead people everywhere and so they would go down in there they didn't get to come into a nice conditioned building like this with power and seats and freedom they had to meet in hiding and he says where they he says and they for nearly a mile under the ground Graves where they had to bury their dead and right on in the corner was a little bitty Graves that was the children where they put the children in the corner and there was a little church down there where they had to hide away I went down there in the old Roman Cathedral where they burnt them now he's at a different place the Roman Cathedral you know where they burnt them to the stake the the um the Roman Coliseum what we would call and where they burnt them to the steak fed them to Lions I walked out there in the middle of that place and stood there I stood around I hadn't seen it yet and all the dirt that fell in if you've ever seen pictures this makes sense to you and there was the great places where the lions come out I walked right about where I thought maybe the lion pit was where the Christians died I raised up my hands and stood there I said oh Jesus I'm such an unworthy creature to think that my brothers sealed their testimony here by the mouth of lions and so forth for the cause of Jesus Christ I happen to stand and look behind me and somebody hoisted up The Old Rugged Cross standing over Yonder I be to hum in my heart on a hill far away stood an Old Rugged Cross the emblem of suffering and shame how that men Through the Ages the whole world is drenched with the blood of the Lord Martyrs of the Lord Jesus Christ I thought what a little old thing that we are thinking about taking a little missionary trip maybe have to stand a little persecution somebody laugh at you see brother Ram's mocking you know humanity and he says I've I'm becoming a football that people kicked me around a whole lot that don't make any difference they kicked other around men before me they did things like that and called this that or the other I got a gospel to preach I got the Lord that I love I got a goal to make can you hear him saying I don't care about this world I don't care about this world I don't care about this world I got a gospel to preach I got the Lord to love Hallelujah I'm on a mission see I got a gospel to preach I got the Lord that I love I got a goal to make and when I come to the end of the road I want to come with every one of you saying this I have fought a good fight that's your desire now watch some of these nights no doubt I'll be standing at the pull pit when my face will turn pale my lip will seal and I'll and he breaks off his sentence he starts back I've always wanted to go across the pull pit like that home to Glory some of these days I'll preach my last sermon I'll make my last altar call I'll pray for the last sick person I want to die with the Bible in my hand calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ fight a good fight finish the course he's preaching he wants to die preaching he wants to die like I do holding up holding up his body Bible saying fight a good fight keep the faith don't quit don't give up he said I want to go home like that finish the course you know the martyrs now can I can I turn more personal now is that okay amen this is what I this this was what my prayer was when I was praying over the reading of the word because I I want to come I I I I I I've given you all the doctrine I'm going to give you and lined up all the quotes I'm going to line up I just want to speak to you from my heart to finish out this third installment you good I'm watching the time the martyrs who died at the stake burned alive the martyrs who stood there where brother brandom said I I stood where I thought the Lions would have a pit and this is where they would come up and they they tore God's children to pieces I want to say to you tonight and I'm quite sure you'll agree with me that the martyrs didn't have the end that they looked for in the Rapture every age thought this is the rapture age I'm going in the Rapture that's been the the driving desire and expectation of every age you don't go back through history anywhere you don't find anyone saying oh it's going to last hundreds and thousands of more years they all thought the Lord is coming right now so when they're being slain and their blood is pouring out and they're being consumed Alive by wild animals I'll assure you that they they didn't have the end that they were looking for in a Rapture moreover I would say that their lives finished in a way they didn't expect I'm pretty sure being a human being myself that none of them serve God going someday I'm going to be Torn to Pieces by wild animals in front of thousands of Romans cheering or I'm going to be burned alive at a stake and yet they were but that wasn't their expectation their lives finished in a way that they didn't expect brother Brandon's life didn't come to an end like he desired we know that now he didn't know that then he's saying I want to die preaching across the pull pit with a Bible in my hand I want to go home to Glory like that life didn't come to an end like he desired now I thought about that and I thought you know God loving his messenger the way he did and often granting him prayers you know on another level I mean brother brandham got prayers answered at Next Level he just he'd just go through and he'd go into a city and start preaching and the hospital would empty out he didn't go there to pray for him he's just preaching and Faith people want to be there so bad they leave the hospital and never need to go back they would line up for blocks city blocks long and brother bradam had to stand in a pull pit for three days and eat his lunch and sleep and get water and everything right there for three days in a pull pit see so so you know when when when I'm thinking about how that God and people would come by ambulances and they would line up city blocks and dead people are being raised this is a man who got his prayers answered a lot and you would think that God loving him the way that he did and granting his prayers at the level that he did and and and and fulfilling brother bram's desires across 33 years of ministry you'd think that he would Grant his Prophet this last dying wish on this side of the race who just wanted to die in the pull pit and you would think that God would have granted him that the martyrs as well um that that gallantry those loyal people our human mind would go and the unbeliever does go and say well if if God's a God why does he allow this suffering and why does this happen and why do good things happen bad things happen to good people and and brother brandham didn't get to Die the way he expected the Martyrs didn't get to die you know we think of the you know we we think of death let me just say it like this we think of death as something dark and ominous and for boing I can only conclude that God doesn't view the end of our race in the same way we do he doesn't view our race in the same sad way that we view it so brother brandham didn't get his desired end but neither did he end the martyrs didn't get their desired end but they didn't end none of them have ever ended Hallelujah friends the Saints of old didn't get their desired end brother brandham didn't get their desired end but but but they didn't end and I'm not going to end and you're not going to end amen I believe I'll be alive to see the coming of the Lord I have two very important reasons very serious important reasons for believing that number one because I don't think it'll be very long more seriously number two I've honored my father and mother to this day amen and my mom and dad are a witnessed to that even as a boy my mother told me I was the break between the two crazies that's not her word words but that's the way I say it sorry sister Lisa God bless [Laughter] you amen I'm not going to make sister Jean say it out loud but but but you know and and she told me that one time it so calmed me down because I you know here was it seemed like Injustice to me which when you're the middle child everything seems like Injustice but but that's the truth and I I had it I had it big time and you know I had seen my younger brother get away with almost capital murder and I'd seen my sister get away with almost capital murder and here I did something that wasn't even that bad wasn't even that bad and uh and I think I think I I I my mom found out I was talking just in a public place I was talking to a girl who wasn't a Believer woo woo man second Chernobyl Chernobyl before Chernobyl my mom lowered the boom on me that was anathema that was never going to work for her and and and and and and and and I said Mom goodness I didn't I was grounded and all this and Mom and I'm 15 16 years old what I did isn't even that bad I mean I you're being too hard on me and she said she would said and I was really starting to pitch a fit and my mom just said Jason you know she said' I've had a much harder time with your brother and sister she said' but you've been like a sparing for me you've been like a Grace a little reprieve a little rest and I just went oh gosh Come here totally wiped me out all my fight went out the door I felt bad for even bringing it up and and and she did she you know when David did what he did and then the Lord cut his sentence short she cut my sentence short and I got out after about a week so amen but I have honored my father and my mother to this day and I know what the Lord promises for that so parents kids honor mom and dad because the Bible says honor your father your mother that that it thing that your life may be long on the earth and things go well for you that you have a good life and you be long live long on the earth am so I I I I I believe that you know that that that at the very least if the Lord continues to wait you all are going to have to put up with me when I'm old and cranky I expect to be here when he comes now it's it's it listen it's true that ultimately I can't control that neither can you ultimately neither can you control that but here is what I can control I'll be serving him when he arrives that I can control I can surrender my life to him on a daily basis that I can control as for me and my house We Shall Serve the Lord that I can control say why are you like that for me to live is Christ and to die is gain when Satan tried to eliminate me prematurely he failed then he then he tried to make me start thinking about death and I went for oh my goodness brother Arvin got on to me so bad he said I've never had somebody test so much in my life and I and I I would go for a walk and I'd feel a little funny feeling I look at my Apple watch and I'd text him I've had this feeling and he goes you're fine next week ah here it is again you're fine and I said what should I do he said exercise eat right and stop checking your heart rate he said when you feel like doing that go sit down and get a drink of water and he was right and the devil got defeated cuz I don't think like that anymore I think about life all the time I think I love life I love what I do I I love preaching the word I I love teaching it to other people that's my commission that's what that's what he told me in Jeremiah 23 stand in my counsel and then you'll cause my people to hear my word and if my people hear my word they'll go free from their sin I don't need to follow you around with a with a with a a drone I can just preach the word and if you're and if you're Zoey life you'll respond he told he told the priesthood in in Malachi chapter 2 that they were to fill themselves up with the knowledge of God so that they could give it out to God's family I've dedicated my whole life to doing just that to fill up my mind with God's word so that when you got a need I have an answer Hallelujah friends I think about life I love what I do I love this church I love you people and and I and I love leading all who I can to the Lord am and compel them with all my heart to give their whole heart I always I never thought I would pastor at all I always imagin myself a missionary going to the world and the Lord let me do that for a long time even after I started pastoring he let me go to the mission field and I still May yet see always chasing that final frontier where the gospel had never been that was always my vision and and I love him for that and I love Believers and I love all you people and I and and this church is such like a f family it's like one large family and this is why the devil just can't hardly he you know it's not that he doesn't try and it's not that we don't have to keep our guard up CU he's all the time trying to get in but I'm here to tell you the love of God I can feel that you love God and you love me and I love you and sister Debbie and I you know it we we feel like your parents that's weird but that's the truth you we talk about it all time we say isn't this crazy they're as old as we are they feel like my children there's people older than me it feels like my children feels like I need to oh I need to worry about I need to care about them I need to call somebody see and you know I you know you are my people amen You Are My People red yellow black or white You Are My People I see the Shadows deepening that brother brandham talked about I see that that we all see that I see the Shadows deepening for the world I know that we can't live forever I know the world can't survive forever Brother brandham start talks about as you as you start toe these things you start to think more seriously about these things and and I have certainly found that to be true but but the bottom line is Friends the bottom line why it why it is so precious in my sight is because I have found as a bottom line that I am not ending and you are not ending the age is ending but we who are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord are not ending Hallelujah those who've gone on ahead of us already have not ended I can see them on the the side smiling I think that that if if they could give us a message today I think they'd say you know the end is not like you think it is and your new life is not like you think it is oh friends what a day awaits us what is precious to you what is precious to you is this world this this filthy nasty cold world that's perishing is that more precious to you than this have you put anything ahead of it remember a willfulness to surrender your life is a main ingredient of overcoming I think that we can't imagine or put into words how we'll feel on the other side when that morning breaks Eternal bright and fair Friends when the robe is Called Up Yonder I'll be there will you be there is that the the central part of your life oh my that thought is precious in my sight I hope that thought just that thought of what your life is coming let that be precious to you young people let that be precious to you start now value it above every other thing that that that that your service to the king should be precious in your sight my then then you can then then you can live here and serve him and be loved by him and be cared for by him wouldn't that be amazing you can have the prize the high calling you know he's going to love you so much that he's actually just before the end going to lift you up out of Harm's Way while Mankind annihilates and ex and makes himself extinct from the earth while mankind perpetrates an Extinction of ENT upon his own self God loves us so much he's going to extract us right up into Heavenly into the Heavenly Realms Hallelujah friends I that's what I'm looking forward to and then we're brought back right here and what are we going to do we're going to build it back we're going to live forever in that perfect world I'll have a perfect heart I'll have perfect thoughts I'll have perfect everything Hallelujah perfect everything to continue to do what sit on clouds and play Heart no to continue service to his majesty the king throughout the world throughout the galaxies throughout the Universe throughout the ever increasing Kingdom of our Lord and his Christ that's what I care about that's what I care about it'll be worth it all as this portion of Our Lives Fades from View and we enter into that Everlasting peace and joy our future is right we have a sure Foundation we have a more sure word of Prophecy than even the early church because they looked at things through prophecy pet looked in his day and looked back on the Old Testament he said now they had the promise we actually had the goods so we have a more sure word of Prophecy than they did they believed it but we actually received it and now here we stand on the on the far end and I'm here to tell you the things that Peter prophesied and John prophesied and Paul prophesied you're living it you have a more sure word of Prophecy in this message of the hour than even they had prophesying it would be here you love him is he precious in your sight why don't you stand with me tonight friends and I just think we ought to sing a song or two before we go to prayer just to let him know how precious that he is I hope that if I've not been able to do anything is to is to get you to re-evaluate in this series get you to re-evaluate what is precious and I would say to you that if serving God if letting his life flow through you if you being him in a restoration of his word and a continuation of his life oh friends if that's not the most precious thing to you then I hope that this three installed three installment series will will have fostered that in your lives bow your heads with me over the building ending right at 8:30 right where I wanted to end all heads bowed father we love you we thank you for your word I thank

think it's on okay is it on it's on um I didn't plan on sharing this at all but it just kind of felt on my heart to do so tonight and it just wanted to share a little bit of a a little bit of just Grace that God gave me and a little message um a few years ago like quite a while ago my dad's Aunt so my great aunt I grew up across the street from her um so she was like a full-on grandma for me and she was taken like for we didn't ever really know the reason um but just passed away in the middle of the night woke up and just didn't really understand it but it hit my sister really hard and you know she went through the whole grief stage I guess but I just kind of locked it away for a while and never let it really process so um the other night I just kind of you know I got a little bit of a dream and it was really sweet um uh so basically in the dream I just just I walked into what felt like a familiar house and I sat down at a little Breakfast Table and there was my aunt cilia s sitting there just um I just got to kind of catch her up on my life and say well I moved to South Carolina and I bought a house and I married a girl that you would love and it was just a really nice time to kind of catch her up on my life that I never really got to it just felt really sweet that I felt like I got to talk to her directly and it just I felt like I got to process it a little bit well I felt the dream kind of getting closer to an end and I just started crying and I was like well I don't want you to go away and she said well don't worry Mah it won't be very long so it's just it felt like an awesome little message that I got and yeah I just want to thank the Lord for his mercy and his grace amen and just a little message amen amen any others and we're going to get one more prayer request but any others got it oh Sister Sarah I just want to thank the Lord for having a good day today um um as many of you know a couple of weeks ago I was back in the ER again with my heart and aib and they had to shock my heart and they had my medications and um the medication that they have me on they'll tell you that it gives you sometimes severe fatigue but what they don't tell you is it almost makes you feel like you're depressed like you can't even get out of the bed in the morning just to get up in the morning and get dressed and brush your teeth is it takes a lot L of mental and physical energy and um for the past two weeks I have just felt completely lifeless and it was just pushing myself day in and day out and day in and day out just trying to cook meal in the evening was just so hard goodness and um Brad wanted to take the dog for a walk last night and I was trying to walk the dog and I felt so bad I just didn't have the energy and it's something that I really enjoy doing and other things that I enjoy doing around my house I just did not find any energy to even do it I wanted to do it but it just couldn't find the energy and so last night when I went to bed I prayed and I told Lord I said I'd rather you just take me home them for me to have to live like this I can't stand this anymore I said can you please take all these negative effects of this medication away from me and let me have a good day tomorrow and so went to sleep and this morning I got up and I looked over at the clock and I said my it's time to get up and I jumped up out of bed and before I realized it I was thinking to myself okay now I need to get the laundry done and I need to run in here and do this and I need to go do that and and then I stopped and I was opening up all the windows I do that every morning and I stopped and I said Thank You Lord that I feel good this morning Hallelujah I'm so grateful amen and he just answered that prayer for me and I'm so grateful
