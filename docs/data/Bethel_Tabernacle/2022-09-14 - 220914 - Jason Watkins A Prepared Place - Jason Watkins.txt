TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you be seated let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also let's pray father we stand here tonight Lord watching the the days pass Lord that I knew I would stand here tonight again by Your Grace under the care of the wings of Jehovah Eagle Lord for some number of days I've saw myself Lord with no change from the Holy Spirit just aiming directly at this thought tonight today Lord I watch the hours pass by knowing that hour by hour minute by minute I would draw closer to the moment when I walked out read this text and begin to bring this word to these people now father I pray Lord we are your children we're the family of God we need your word Lord so come now father I pray make this word a living reality to us tonight help me Lord to convey the thought that's upon My Heart Lord effectively and clearly I commit it to you master we are Lord you are you're our heavenly father we are your family we're your children you are obligated Lord to feed your family Lord you are obligated to be a father because it is you who chose to be that it is you who brought us into the world Lord these are everything that we do is For Your Glory it's to serve your purposes and so we're here tonight Lord to do exactly that now I commit myself surrendering in every way humanly that I can myself to your leadership in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated brother Branham takes up this this scripture in the message things that are to be very late in his ministry in fact is he's at this point when he preaches this sermon he is less than 30 days from going to his reward and leaving the Realms that we live in presently now he didn't die no Christian ever did die and but we do realize that he moved on to uh to that next realm and you know we We Know by the preaching and teaching of the word of God that if you go by the way of the Grave on Resurrection mourning The Trumpet Of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first amen and brother Branham said if that's the situation for you then you will you your theophany will come and pick up your body that was stored and buried I remember you know offering the words of comfort to my family and to my mother and to you as a church at the at the loss of brother Eddie when I stood there and I said now you just remember all we're doing is storing his body this isn't brother Eddie in this casket we're just storing his Temple we're going to store it out here in a graveyard and and on that morning he'll come and he'll pick it back up and it'll be glorified and changed and brother Branham said if you die then you bring that theophany to pick up this body if you are alive and remain at the trumpet of when the Trump Trumpet Of God sounds then you bring this living body to the theophany and you are changed in a moment then we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye what a moment oh what a moment I'm waiting for that moment My Moment by moment day by day we pass time and we we're here to serve the Lord and since since my life and future are bright and your life and your future are bright the life that lays ahead of us friends then why would we uh look at this life in a self-gratifying way why would we not rather just give ourselves unreservedly to whatever his plan is for our life seeing as hell this life isn't my real life the one coming is my real life brother Branham is going to deal with that quite a bit here in things that are to be he preaches this as at the same time he's preaching on the Rapture and he he I think he preaches the Rapture first and then he comes with things that are to be here and he says here now Jesus here is speaking about he's gone ahead to prepare a place for us let not your hearts be troubled that is a weighty statement let not your hearts be be troubled I I want to say to you tonight as I just began to feel the surge of the anointing coming upon me I just believe God has something special for you to realize tonight about this life and I don't know what the devil might have uh badgered you with over the last week or over today or whatever you might be going through but I'm here to tell you and remind you he ain't nobody he don't make any decisions about your life or my life my life my times are in his hands if the enemy is it really he's just the greatest puppet ever known because everything he does concerning me he has to get permission well if my father gives him permission then praise the Lord see so I the the bottom line is he can't stop me you're just Revel in that for a moment and say he can't stop me I'm already ordained before the foundation of the world and he's never been able to stop the ordained works of almighty God he tries to interfere but all he ends up doing is uh he ends up making the way for God to do it even easier he is you know you'd think um uh someone frustrated so severely over so many centuries so many times would give up [Laughter] you know I I I I I think that he he tries to get you to give up because he's so angry that he can he would like to he knows if he gives up he's doomed and he's doomed anyway but you know he he he's he's very faithful at trying to discourage us you know it's it's like a person you I've seen people you know and come across people who were who were very angry you know sometimes at at things that they see other believers do you know that might be a little carnal yeah okay granted but this person just get abnormally angry and indignant over the whole thing and you know I I sadly I have occasionally found and more often true than it's not that when I see that level of reaction I I end up finding out a little while down the road that really the reason that person was so angry is they actually want to do that but they're afraid to do it they don't want to miss the Rapture and don't want to go to hell and don't and so they're afraid and and they live under Perpetual anger because they want to be wild and they want to be carnal but they live under a fear that they can't be and it comes out in the in their judgmental ways of other people amen that's not my sermon tonight breathe Karma it's okay you'll be all right it's not my sermon but you know I think that's the way the devil is that he he knows he he can't win and so if he can't win he doesn't want you to win either but he I found out by the Bible he's already too late and I love telling him that I love telling him that Satan you're actually you're already too late I mean as of right now already it's already too late you already can't stop it see so so so God is in control of it all brother Branham is going to illustrate that here he says he says let not your hearts be troubled because the real promise when you realize that if he's gone to prepare something for you that where he's going you're going to end up going the same place then then why would you let your heart be troubled over anything I mean if you think about it just think it through for a minute if he's already got another world waiting for me and that's eternal life and it's Eternal joy and it's Eternal Bliss and I don't ever have to come back here and do this again say well you know you might have another 20 30 years of of hardship I can do 20 years I can do I can do the time I can do 30 years I'm going to keep fighting for Jesus anyway it doesn't matter I'm never going to stop you know it doesn't matter how many I might even stumble and I might even trip myself I'm gonna get back up I'm never walking away I'm never stopping you know if if somebody wants me destroyed the Lord's gonna have to do it because I'm not going to stop I'm gonna go forward and when I'm done I'm gonna go forward some more and I'll go and tell the trumpet sounds until death takes me and then it's not really death anyhow or until the trumpet sounds and then I'll be with you and we'll be alive and remain and I believe that that's the way it'll be because I believe the Rapture of the of God's consummation of his Rapture of his Gentile family is coming in my lifetime Hallelujah so he says let not your heart be troubled I've gone ahead to prepare a place let not your heart be troubled now he was talking to the Jews they had no trouble believing God but it was when God became flesh that's where they had a hard time and listen we realized that you know the world sometimes has a hard time seeing God in you and Christ in you but that's really immaterial that what they think of you is not going to stop you I'm here tonight to try to make you not think that about you let not your heart be troubled because God's got this and he's got you and he's got a plan and you're it see and so a lot of times we have trouble seeing don't we come on don't we we find right with our frailties and our mistakes and our and we say my what is wrong with me how many how many have said that my goodness what's wrong with me why Lord help me Lord forgive me oh I don't have a clue why in the world would I do that and and and and I yeah and then the devil tries to come and say see where's your experience where's the Holy Ghost well you know I I might can't answer that kind of a charge but here's what I can say I'm a Believer and I know I fail but I'm a Believer and I know I come up short but I'm a Believer and I love God and I know I love God and I love his word and I love his lifestyle that's why I'm so upset that I didn't live it if I didn't love it why would I be upset so it's not just you know putting the devil in his place you need to put you in your place and start believing what God said about you and start believing the fact that you're a Believer and that you couldn't be unless he made you one that's Bible the human mind the Fallen mind is enmity against God's against God it could never agree with every way it could never say Amen to all of God's word and so the fact that you can means you're already an Impossible Creature you already are living in a plane that you couldn't get yourself to he says so he says some God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself now as you have believed in God believe also in me for in my father's house for many mansions and I go to prepare a place Jesus life was fixing to end here on Earth he had shown the people and proved to them that he was Jehovah manifest in the flesh now he said now watch this now he said when you see my life ending it's ending for a purpose and that's big because as long as you can see that your life has a Divine Purpose you won't let the devil bully you you'll realize that you're you're marching you get orders from a different headquarters amen and you're not subject to his to his moods I don't care if Satan woke up on the wrong side of the bed today that's nothing to do with me it's nothing to do with me I can't he goes about like a roaring lion I don't care nothing to do with me I know this my Lord doesn't wake up on the wrong side of the bed every day he loves me every day he cares me every day he comes after me and if I Stray he comes after me anyhow oh my when you see my life ending it's ending for a purpose I'm going away to prepare a place for you see so that's that's that was a motive a major motive in the heart of God that he brother Branham said he wanted to share his eternal life my goodness what a statement God wanted to share his eternal life with you and me and so he says Jesus therefore is telling his disciples now this is an important point and I really want you to absorb this this is probably the thing that's the closest to my heart that if I can get you to understand I know you're going to understand it but if I can get you to really own it and assimilate it and he says Jesus therefore is telling his disciples that this life is not ended in death now you just let that soak for a minute this life that you're living right now the one that you got in you that's animating your body if your life left your body your body would collapse and the real you would be standing beside it see you'd still be alive that life that's the life I'm talking about that that that life is not ended in death see so he makes reference he said if I if this was a funeral text he says you know death human death of the physical body now listen up teenagers this is really really informative for you because you're so young you don't naturally think about what he's about to say it took an older man say this it's taking an older man tonight to say to you teenagers listen up because that's what naturally occurred to you say how do you know because I used to be a teenager and it never naturally occurred to me but watch what he says he says remember we death sets right before us and we don't know whether there may be some in this building tonight will not go out of here alive you don't even know that's how uncertain life is you might not go out of here tonight alive he says um in this you might not go out of here alive in this physical life that's how uncertain it is five minutes from now all right here is an absolute bona fide fact it doesn't mean it's going to happen but at 100 percent could happen say well it's unlikely but it could all right five minutes from now I could start timing it five minutes from now it could be that a young healthy young people in this building can be a corpse in five minutes from now that is true and again it could be in five minutes from now with everyone be in glory I might start jumping them down on that one we just don't know that's in the hands of God Jesus said he didn't know himself when that time would be that was in the hands of the father only so now but he was telling them that after death there is life because I go and prepare a place that is to receive them shows that there he was speaking to them that there was a life after this life ended what a consolation that ought to give to all of us to know that after this life is over there is a life that we go into oh here's a good one I love this one as you get older that becomes more of a reality to you and you begin as you begin to see the days of your life drawing close then it began you begin to pack up closer getting ready for that great event he's calling your physical departure a great event it took a prophet to talk like that you know wait a minute somebody's gonna die it's a great event yes it's a great event well how can you say that because they they won't really be dead it means that this life the one you have right now he said watch this he says he says he says because I go to prepare a place so after this life he won a consolation that ought to give to all of us to know that after this life is over there is a life that we go into as you get older that becomes more of a reality to you as you begin to see the days of your life drawing close and it begins you begin to pack up getting ready for that great that great event it's a it's a it's a continuing of this same life in another world Glory Hallelujah it's a continuation say what is death it's a continuation of life in another world another place that's why I'm a Christian that's why I'm a Believer that's why I love the Lord so now he's going to he's going to turn a corner he's almost almost gonna when you listen to it on tape it's almost like brother Branham has set up set him up you know he's got everybody you know rejoicing and now he's really going to make some Baptists mad because he's going to talk about the importance of having your life ready his very next line is it's a continuing of the same life and into the world another place now watch he goes he's going to go straight from there into the very next paragraph your birth here was pre-planned I guess you believe that every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned did you know that your being here was never originated just a myth or a thought everything was all planned by God before the foundation of the world that you would be here the infinite God knowed and to be infinite he had to know every flea that ever would be in the earth and how many times it would bat its eye that's infidency our little Minds our little Minds cannot fathom what infinite means the infinite God he note all things therefore there's nothing out of cater can I say to you tonight friends and and feel free to jump up and run around the building and run up down the street screaming I don't care what kind of sorrow sadness sickness whatever whatever's your trial whatever's your Affliction whatever whatever is going on to you nothing's out of cater I don't care where your physical health is where your mental health is Where Your Children Are where your finances are where your where your marriage is nothing's out of cater so there's a lot of brother Jason I could tell you a story I'm not saying you don't have issues and problems I'm saying there's somebody still in control nothing's out of cater there's an all-powerful hand got his hand on it you say but it's really bad it's in his hand don't worry little bride it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom oh you're gonna get the kingdom it might not be in the next five minutes but it's gonna be if we know the word of God we know where we're living we know the hour that we're living in we know what lays ahead we see what we've passed and the Book of God is the revelation of Jesus Christ his Works Through the Ages that was up to the Book of Revelation and then his promises that is to come so all of his promises are true God cannot speak any word without it being confirmed every word that he says has to come to pass before the foundation of the world so I want you to take some consolation in this fact in this fact that was exposed by a prophet everything in your life is taken care of and that doesn't that that's that steps around trials it steps around hardships it steps around sickness it steps around grief it steps around persecution it steps around doesn't matter what it is everything is prepared Jesus said I go to prepare a place he God God is in the preparing business the Bible tells us in Matthew 3 for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord make his path straight so God sends a prophet to prepare his arrival see Luke 1 76 and thou child shall be called the prophet of the highest for Thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways so John prepared the way but really it was the father who prepared the way for Jesus ministry and so you know parents prepare for children Ministry pastors prepare I prepare sermons to preach I prepare myself to be a spiritual man I prepare myself to study I prepare to pray you say you prepare to pray you know you know how I prepare to pray I get in the spirit brother Branham says before you do anything get in the spirit before even before you pray say well I I just I start praying and I and and I just pray my way into the Spirit Well you you're supposed to get into the spirit before you pray say what's a good way to do it sing a song the Bible says have a song on your lips and a Psalm in your heart and and and and you know start rejoicing in the Lord and start thanking God I'm here to tell you if you started it at at when the chickens go get up and you thanked him all the way till dark thirty you couldn't thank him enough if you did that every day for 25 years in a row and you spent the whole entire time of your life just thanking him you'd never thank him enough so so Paul talks about in second Timothy chapter 2. uh give me that Jeremiah second Timothy chapter two let's read it together we'll begin in verse 16. and I'll just read down through looks like maybe 20 verse 22 second Timothy chapter 2 verse 16. but here's some instructions shun profane and and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenius and felitis who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection has passed already and overthrow the faith of some nevertheless the foundation of God's standeth Shore those guys ran their race blew things up injured people's lives but the word of God still Stood Still Still stood sure see and look what it says nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver which are good good ones but also wooden of Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore Purge himself from these now who's going to purge him he's going to purge himself if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meet for the Master's use and preparedness stay right there on that verse and prepare to every good work I mean this ain't rocket science you don't need Gabriel to come down tonight you don't need to have a spiritual dream like Daniel you don't even you don't even need me up here waving and turning red and screaming at you here's a perfect instead of instructions a man therefore if a man Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified in meat from the master's use and prepare to every good work from Purge myself from what things from unbelievers people like hymenius and felitas people who who who go in and and Lead whole households into lasciviousness you know and and and evil concupiscence and evil desires and all of these different things I mean this is not rocket science this is overcoming 101. you purge yourself of these things how with prayer with praise with church with the word amen you purge yourself of these things Jesus said I go to prepare a place see so he so the principle now is for you because where is he going and he says the way you know and they said to him later what do you we don't know what do you mean with the way we know how do we know and the Jews even questioned him before that he was he was you know saying strange stuff and and then almost and almost a very very you know uh you know in an abstract way and you know I'm going to go away and a little while you won't see me the world won't see me but you'll see me and and the Jews are like wait wait what where does he where is he going that we can't come what's he talking about see and now he's coming here I go to prepare a place that where I am you can be also so I'm I'm here to tell you that's why brother Branham said it's a it's a prepared place for prepared people say I want to go to a place he prepared he wants you to be prepared he wants you to be the place he's talking about because he's going to go and live inside his church see so he says verse 22 flee also youthful us but follow righteousness Faith charity peace and them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart that's easy that's not hard that's not complicated that's not mysterious flee youthful lust follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart brother Branham you know he deals with that I don't want to get sidetracked and I'll get into my Sunday material I don't want to do that desperately bad tonight so so if we okay you can take that down Jeremiah I don't I don't want to just keep putting scriptures up it slows me down I'm just going to refer to these you know even uh even in Revelation 8 6 and this is kind of edging into Sunday's material and the Seven Angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound so you see this whole I mean even the the way of the Antichrist in Revelation 16 12 and the six Angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the waters thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared so God's preparing both sides he's preparing his family and the devil's family he's preparing say World politics God's preparing that world events world wars famine disease nature God's prepared it is what it is because he prepared it to be Hallelujah nothing is out of cater I know The Madness of the world I know it's cast on the streets I know it's Insanity I know the the seventh seal and the seventh trumpet and the seventh vial in the seventh plague and brother Branham says they're all now ready to unfold on the world I'm so glad a bride is taking a Third Exodus I don't listen here's the easy part Getting Gone getting out that's the easy part the only way out is up now I can't get me up so he's gonna have to pull me up my job is to be prepared Hallelujah so so Jesus prepared a place for your life to continue forever that's rejoicing grounds so he so back to our text let not your heart be troubled see now that you know all of this let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe in me in my father's house are many mansions many bodies there's a there's a word body already waiting on me say I hope I go to a word body it's already there [Music] if the Earthly Tabernacle that we live in be dissolved we have one already waiting in the heavens I've already got an identified body it's a word body Hallelujah that's why they say that's why brother Brandon would say you believe this message it's become a revealed Revelation to you you've heard from your theophany see you know you might not realize that friends but every day that you live you're getting closer and closer to a new world you're getting closer and closer and brother Brandon just starts talking about that we'll speed up they'll slow down oh my you're making more progress than you know you are and that's that's can be frustrating at times and we see that we know that brother Brown talks about the Harvest going to it's going ripe and it's laying in the August we've been dealing a lot about that the August presence laying in the presence of the Sun and this thought is somewhat of a continuation of that and brother Madam says the the level of growth and maturity gets real slow now that's in in nature go plant a wheat field and once the shuck has pulled back and the Green Seed is out in the then the the presence of the sun begins to turn it gold and yellow see and and it and it gets hardened and I who was I just hearing recently preach well I don't know if it was for the mat or brother Matt I don't remember now I was listening to someone and they were talking I didn't know this oh no it was uh I think it was Brother David Samuel on our morning thing I think well Joe you might remember this where the the farmer the wheat farmer that you know how he knows that grain is completely ripe he'll go out there when he he thinks it's getting close and he'll take it and he'll pinch it and he'll take his fingernails his two thumbnails and he'll dig into it and then he'll look at it and he'll look at the little dents the indentions that his nails dug into it and he knows it's not ready because it's still got moisture in there it's still not fully ripe see you wouldn't want it yet and so he'll go away and let the August presence just hit it and hit it and hit it lay out there in the presence of the Sun and then he'll come back sometime later and he'll dig in he'll pull another and he'll dig his thumbnails in there you can really torque it and he'll look and all of a sudden wow I can't Den it anymore but now there's one more test he'll take it he'll put it between his teeth fight down on that thing and put some put some pounds per square inch on it and he'll look at it and if it's completely ripe and ready he there's no effect all that pressure there's no effect anymore I'm here to tell you something friends all of them are coming to a time it don't matter how much pressure it don't matter what happens in your life it has no effect on me it doesn't leave a mark anymore I'm overcoming it it doesn't matter what Satan does that's what we're headed to friends that's when the bride is raptured she's prepared to go in a rapture because look Jesus now if you'll notice and I I dealt with this I've dealt I've preached on this before some time ago and I dealt with a little bit of Virginia because Jesus didn't say I go to prepare a place that where I'll be you can be also he was going to go somewhere and you are going to be in that same place but what he said was that where I am where I am right now not where I'm going not what I'll be but that where I am I have gone to prepare a place for you that where I am right now say where where was he right then he was full of the Holy Ghost he was full of Faith full of Power full of love full of grace he was ready for Calvary he was ready to go he was ready for the next event nothing was going to stop him why because he said I I I'm trying to give you this principle because I'm going to need you to get just like me and I'm going away and what am I going to do I'm going to bring a holy ghost back and I'm going to come inside of you and then you're gonna be an extension of me and I'm the beginning of the creation of God I'm a prototype I'm a brand new kind of human being and there's going to be a whole from a people just like me who believe every word of God who trust in everything how many are here and I say I'm one of them I trust in the Lord I'm a Believer in all of his word that you have arrived at when he said where I am now just as he was ready you're getting ready see so the place he is going to is into the form of the Holy Spirit but so so where he is a place of total compliance to the heavenly father and there's that's what the Holy Ghost is given for to do in you what it did in him he's in a place of total compliance to the father see and says that we can be that where I am you may be also I I'm not going to uh have well put it up for me Jeremiah John chapter 7. here's some of that mercurial talk that they couldn't understand Jesus Lives he's just blowing their minds John 7 37 and to 39. in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood in Christ saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spaky of the Holy Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified and so the message then in in everything and all of the burden that's on my heart tonight the message and the whole thought is is really summed up to this that if you desire to go where he was going and become what he became then you have to go the way he went by the same baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so that's why you can't join the family of God that's why you can't just shake the preacher's hand and brother Adam said put your name on a book and believe just in a historical and have have just uh uh a mental concept because Jesus was saying I'm going away to prepare and and if I go away I'll come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also so if you desire to go where he was going how many want to do that then you then you have to become what he became and you have to go the way he went to become what he became to go where he was going what did I just say but it has to be by the same baptism of the Holy Ghost the same thinking the same mind of Christ the same mind that says Amen to every word the same willingness listen listen listen the same willingness that he had to lay your life down I think I proved to you at the beginning at the beginning of the sermon I don't know why in the world you keep chasing trying to make this life a happy one this one don't even count this one don't even show up on the on this on the graph I mean this one wouldn't move the needle on the Richter scale at all this life is only about the next one this is only a Proving Grounds a training grounds a Proving Grounds a training field I've said that to you so many times and this is what brother Branham is saying your life was pre-planned by God see and so it has to be the same willingness to lay your life down and take up your cross because the conditions John 12 24 Jeremiah I'm giving you a workout tonight John 12 24 the same conditions for the reward of being where he is see it's found in this 24th verse verily verily truly truly I say unto you and this applied to him and it applies to you except a corn of wheat Fallen to the ground and die and abideth alone but if it died bringeth forth much fruit listen let me just let me read it to you and bring it home with all truth and sincerity remember you remember when brother Abraham Meyer was here and he he's reading John 14 and Jesus is saying that in my father's house are many mansions he's trying he's getting ready to go he's getting ready to leave them and he's trying to leave them with some words of comfort and my I go away to prepare and my don't worry I'll come again in my father's house are many mansions and your life here is only a representation of one that's already there anyway see and and and and and and I'm gonna go and I'm gonna prepare this way for you but but understand this that even me even I and and brother Abraham Point pointed out he says look how sincere the Lord Jesus was look how honest I mean hey teenage girls let me tell you something unconverted boys are liars last day and cheaters and they'll do you wrong Brothers unconverted girls are liars and cheaters and will do you wrong I have nothing to do with them say well I love her good pray for her that God will give her the Holy Ghost then she might be ready for you so so brother Abraham is saying look at his sincerity and he's saying to the people if it were not so I would have told you listen if this was to if I was a fake I'd just tell you if none of this was true and in my father's house are many mansions but if it wasn't true I wouldn't mislead you I would just admit it and I would say listen I'm sorry um I've got a I've got a this power that I can do great Miracles and everything but I really can't help you I know you're all following me and I fed you one time five thousand of you and I did it again you saw me walk on water but the bottom line is there's really nothing in it for you and I'm just going to be honest that's that was his level of integrity that if it were not so I would tell you but it is so it is true you believe in God believe in me in my father's house are many mansions I I've seen those mansions and that's how I know who you are I already know you have an identity waiting on you [Applause] see verily verily I've seen you accept a corn of wheat Fallen to the ground and died abideth alone so if you if you chase this world you end up with nothing no matter listen death finishes everything you've accomplished talk about an exercise in futility if you if you become the king of the world the richest person in the world and have everything times a thousand more money and more Fame and more popularity and you've got more likes and more subscribers and and it doesn't matter you you get elected to the highest office in the land I'm sorry uh death is the end of the line and then you die alone and you take none of those friends none of that money none of those possessions Sinners die alone they die very much alone and so Jesus is going to give the rip get give the remedy to not die alone see truly truly I say unto you except a corn of wheat Fallen to the ground and die at abideth alone but if it die spiritually speaking now it bringeth forth much fruit see you know Hudson Taylor when he came to the very next chapter hero of mine I remember reading his life story one of reading his life stories what made me want to be a missionary and travel the world even more than reading about David Livingston it was Hudson Taylor missionary to the Chinese to China and he starts talking about Saint John 15 the very next passage that Jesus is going to go to give me Saint John 15. Jeremiah let's read let's look at that verse 1 from Saint John chapter 15 I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman go on every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and we're going to stop right here every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now first first let me give you the the main stay or the main sense of this verse this primarily is talking about the church ages brother Branham is clear on that you go all the way back to the 1950s all the way through the end of his ministry and whenever he goes to Saint John 15 2 he's always talking about the church ages that they a messenger caught it and ran with it and people gathered it then the messenger died went off the scene God took his bride home and then they built a denomination around it and God he immediately hewed it off and went on to the next stage and dropped another star out of his right hand and another messenger hit the earth and caught another mystery and ran with it again and this cycle went all the way through seven Church ages because it becomes problematic you have to be very careful when you apply it to your human life because and brother Branham even got challenged on that uh in in a message in trying to do God a service without it being his will very late in November the 27th 19th 65. because it's you have to if you're going to break it down into a human because and here was the man's question he was trying to trying to challenge brother Brown and he come to him he says so so that day I was preaching on that I said now you see when the church first started out it was Jesus said I was pre he says I was preaching John 15 I am the vineyard of the branches and every branch that don't bring forth fruit he will cut off and it'll be burned and someday just got on my neck real hard about that on that and said Gee I thought if he was actually once filled with the Holy Ghost and saved you said you couldn't get away from it so this man is like trying to front on on brother Brown and said wow so I what's all this about the Holy Ghost I thought you know once I've passed from Death to life you told me if I get the Holy Ghost that I'm I'm in and now you're telling me that if I if my life becomes unfruitful that that I'm going to be hearing often cast and sent to Hell after all I'm gonna go into a tribulation after all and you can see that that's what you would could almost think but brother Ram says the the main primary thing of that is Jesus is speaking of the age the church ages and that's all through the message uh quote of quote of the quote but thinking about that he starts talking about and trying to bring it down to the human life and he says remember and he starts putting it into into the works into your life and he's really talking about like Jesus said except a corn of wheat died abideth alone but if it died then it'll bring forth much fruit and brother Branham talks about that and he goes into it I'm not going to take all these quotes at all because I'm out of time now but he says you know remember he's got you know you're his hands and you're his feet and you're his mouth and you're his lips and so so there is this this Dynamic that that it's Christ in you living out his life through you and and that's and that's exactly now we're talking about a fruitfulness okay and so now this guy is asking brother for animal I thought wow you said if I had the Holy Ghost and saved you said you couldn't get away from it brother and says that's right he says well what about that I said now you're talking on a different subject he's talking about fruit bearing there not the vine he's talking about fruit bearing and not the life see it's not about being born again and then unborn again it's about fruit bearing see and so so uh I mean because because you know and that's why when Hudson Taylor picks this up he says the methods of the Divine gardener are not necessarily severe not necess not of necessity not necessarily severe he cleanses by the application of the word and where the gentle voice of the spirit through the word is listened to severe and painful discipline may be unneeded I just want to say wow I know how I'm walking from now on man I got some insight here thank you brother Hudson thank you for pointing that out to me how much of restraint as well as of constraint we might be spared did the word of God dwell in us more richly and we're the leadings of the spirit more implicitly obeyed read that sentence again how much of restraint as well as of constraint we might be spared did the word of God dwell in us more richly and were the leadings of the spirit more implicitly obeyed and and I thought when I read that I thought I mean that rang in my heart and I thought wow I mean it's Hudson Taylor is a great man of God but that was under the man age I wonder brother Branham and I went and there and there's where I ended up here in this quote and trying to do God of service and brother random confirms what he said yeah it's not talking about life it's talking about fruitfulness and it's your fruitfulness Jesus said that where I am I'm going somewhere because I'm I am now and that's going to take me to the next event and if you want to get there you're going to have to come here say well how where are you except a corn of wheat diet abideth alone but if it died then it's going to bring forth much that's good for me that's good for you see it was good for Christ it's good for his church I mean this is exactly why I mean when brother Branham that bro I mean brother Branham connects Saint John 12 24 uh where where we read verily verily I say do you accept the court of wheat falling to the ground and died abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit I mean brother Branham connected Saint John 12 24 to revelation 22 17. in the church age book he connected them together because 2217 is the spirit and the bride say come where'd you get that voice where'd you get that Authority because when a corn of wheat I found out that if I just stayed to myself I died alone but if I was willing to die spiritually then I would be reborn and I'd become part of a kingdom and someday sit on a throne with the king and the spirit and the bride say come it's not about losing your Eternal your Eternal reward or being born again and then you're being unborn again it's about fruitfulness friends Jesus said I go to prepare a place and your life is prepared by God the holy spirit will come this is the promise he was trying to get to him the holy spirit will come our part is to have our hearts and Minds prepared for the word to speak through us that's what Christianity is really about that's what the Holy Ghost is given for so that we can have our hearts and Minds prepared for the word to speak to us for the Holy Ghost to move through us for the plan of God to live and conquer through us I want him to conquer through me I want him to live through me he prepared I am prepared God's prepared the word is prepared the world is prepared politics are prepared it's all prepared of God the Antichrist is prepared God has has those blowing the seven Trumpets They prepared themselves Paul talks about how that we are preparing ourselves and this is why Jesus finishes down we didn't read all the way down in our text in Saint John 14 but in the 27th verse Saint John 14 27. peace I leave with you Saint John 14 27 peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not he says it again let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid I just say that's me that's me Lord he starts out this great chapter let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions I go to prepare a place that and if it were not true I would tell you I'm going to prepare a place so that where I am now and where I'm going you can come to now and then you can join me and he concludes it all right before then he's going to switch to fruitfulness and he says peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth I told him in Virginia it's not about how many zeros are in your bank account it doesn't matter whether your vehicle is a blue oval or a TriStar doesn't matter [Laughter] oh my sister Debbie keeps she keeps spotting this vehicle and she goes oh I love that one I'll try to start oh that was really nice in TriStar and she wants it till I
