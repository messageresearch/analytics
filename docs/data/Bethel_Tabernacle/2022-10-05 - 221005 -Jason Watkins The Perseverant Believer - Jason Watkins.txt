[Music] [Applause] Lord I'm gonna Minister tonight by the will of the Lord on thee um the perseverant believer amen how many are perseverant how many are believers your perseverant believer amen praise the Lord we're going to turn to John's gospel the very first chapter and looking forward to what God has tonight amen but Tom you keep hanging out we're going to keep you man uh we don't play when it comes to that amen we will lock you up amen praise the Lord hallelujah happy to have uh brother Tony's family also still with us amen liable to keep her too amen God bless you happy to have all of you here tonight we've got a few that are out sick want to be remembering brother Mark just about their whole family went down today and it kind of just you know Daisy Chained and went through the whole family and by the time the afternoon was rolling in the devil was just at War but that's okay we're gonna we're gonna strike a counter-offensive back in prayer tonight amen want to pray for them and the other different ones perhaps that aren't able to be here tonight amen Saint John chapter 1. and we'll catch this while you're standing verse 29 through 39. when you have it say Amen the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him in saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh the way the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me cometh the man which is preferred before me for he was before me and that amazing because John was actually you know older in In the Flesh he was born ahead of Jesus but he's actually looking at a man he said this was a man and he was actually before me all right and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water and John bear records saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and at Abode upon him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and I saw in Bear record that this is the son of God again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he said Behold the Lamb of God and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus then Jesus turned and saw them following him saith unto them what seek ye they said in him Rabbi which is to say being interpreted Master where dwellest thou he saith unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and Abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour wow oh my so much in my heart let's bow our heads father we thank you ever so much Lord for this wonderful time tonight to be in your presence to be here in the house of God to just read your word fills me it Thrills me Lord and fills me with excitement father and I I have just so enjoyed my fellowship with you Lord over these last days and especially all throughout this day Lord to just make sure I had your perfect mind and everything that you wanted to say tonight so now I completely surrender myself to you in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated when brother Branham preaches on the sermon title perseverance he preaches that excuse me and then he also will preach perseverant and of course in all cases he's taking the same thought but he doesn't begin here in John's gospel he actually begins in the Book of Matthew with the uh the Gentile woman who came to him and uh in Matthew 15 which we'll get to it shortly the woman of tire and sight on so she was the seraphinician woman and that's where he will take his text from and we're gonna we're gonna get to that in the next few minutes thank you for Tony but I but he also covers in those in those sermons and in that thought he will take up John coming baptizing and the reason that brother Branham is going to take John uh during that sermon and where I want to start with it tonight is that John had to be very perseverant John had you know been in the wilderness a long time when God would send him forth he went into the Wilderness we're taught by history at about the age of nine years old seems astonishing but he was a man of the Wilderness and instead of following his father into the priesthood which would have been the normal path but Believers don't normally go normal paths amen the one thing that's normal is we're pretty abnormal amen and uh and we're oddballs and we're nuts but we're screwed to the right Bolt Hallelujah and so you'll do better not trying you ever do one of those things where you're trying to explain something in the the more you try to explain it the worse it becomes don't try to qualify yourself or explain yourself to the world because all you'll do is it'll just get worse and you'll make a mess just say I'm a Believer and I'm I I believe in the Bible and I believe in Christ and that that that just explains everything that's why brother Brandon would say you know we find many people who don't understand how we are so happy and free I've been filled with the spirit there isn't a doubt and that's what's the matter with me and then he sings it that way oh that's what's the matter with me I love hearing him sing that I start singing along to the top of my lungs that's what's the matter with me amen I'm a Believer and so we're following a man who was a Mystic to the world brother I'm said he lived in a realm all to himself in a world all to himself and sometimes even his own disciples didn't understand the things that he did and he said that you don't know what I'm doing now but you'll know afterwards when the Holy Spirit comes he'll remind you of things I've said and it'll all start to make sense to you I'm going to tell you something friends before after you're born again of the spirit of God the gospel makes a whole lot more sense I would just invite you tonight don't struggle just get a new birth and your life will make a whole lot more sense amen praise the Lord also still happy to have sister Amy's family here as well see them also don't want to overlook them amen I bet everybody in here is going amen I'm terrible for that but I wanted to catch them I happened to see them sitting there so you know we we talk about John having to really be perseverant because you know he was in the desert a long time and I mean when you're in the desert your life don't make a whole lot of sense all he knows is I've been sent here and I'm going to have a message someday I'll have a message I mean while he's 12 while he's 16 while he's 19. you know he's just going all along then he's 25 and he's he's carrying on along and then finally one day I mean he's gonna he's gonna come up to his 30th birthday and he's been in the wilderness all these years and all he knows is is that there's going to come one and you're going to forerun him and you're going to go baptizing in water that's really all he knew and and that's why when he comes here you'll find him they say you know who are you what what do you identify what do you say about yourself and really the only thing he could do is just go and say you know I'm not the Messiah no I'm not that I'm not that Prophet you know uh what but yeah what about the one Moses spoke of no that's not me well who are you well I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness as best I can tell you that's it that's your whole pedigree I'm sorry I lived in the wilderness that's what he told me here I come baptizing and so his life didn't make a whole lot of sense probably to John you can imagine him trying to explain the purpose of his life to to these uh learned men but he knew here's what he knew here's what made him perseverant he did know for sure God spoke to him and sometimes friends as a Believer things come up in our lives and all I can all I know is God spoke to me God called me I can't explain everything it doesn't all make sense even to me and I'm the one lived it but I know I'm here tonight I'm preaching a gospel I'm preaching a sermon because God gave it to me I don't even know what'll happen tomorrow I'm not sure how I survived yesterday but here I am yeah you're going in the Rapture yeah someday oh we've been hearing that well yeah I've been hearing about it too that's been going a long time yeah okay so what do you think I'm a Believer so what are you gonna do I'm going into Rapture oh you still believe that absolutely when will you stop believing that I won't oh I was listening to brother brother Matt sermon here some Services ago when I was away and brother Matt starts talking about you know Malachi Ford he said you say oh when are you going to stop talking about Malachi 4 we're going to stop talking about a prophet he said I'm never going to stop there's nothing else to say that's that's the message to The World God has sent a message and a messenger and it's calling you out to call you up and I'm here to tell you friends like brother Jack Duff says who I'll be ministering for in a few days if you don't hear come out you will never hear come up now I have a keen interest in hearing come up so I'm definitely paying attention to come out amen you know when he talks about John my the things that he had to endure and and he comes out and he's and he he knows enough that when he sees Christ he says there he is build the Lamb of God and he's so sure he says it twice actually three times he says it directly then refers to it then says it directly again and and so so in the mouth of two or three Witnesses and here is a dispensational angel he's a prophet messenger he's not just a prophet John he's more than a prophet as Jesus would say because he's a dispensational messenger see just like we had in this day it was more than just a prophet it was a dispensational angel all right much that just like as Paul went forward so I so so no wonder we quote from it a lot you know what does your mind tell you I'm gonna do of course I'm going to quote from it a lot my whole life is hung upon it so so you know when will I stop telling the world about a message and a messenger When I'm Gone the world won't hear me say it anymore see and so so we find that so I didn't say to the world it's okay you'll be rid of me soon enough so so we so we find that that he goes forward and he's so positive that he says it and then he says it again and then he says it again and he says it to a crowd he says it to people says it to his or his own disciples who he who by this time he loves like his own family these are men who are he's leading their soul they have they're depending their their their banking their soul on him being right you think that doesn't weigh on a man you think that didn't weigh on the messenger of this age you think that doesn't weigh on me you think that doesn't weigh on every Minister we have here knowing that when we get up here people are banking their soul and their children and their family that we're preaching the inerrant word of God I'm here to tell you something friends let me give you an assurance tonight we are preaching the inerrant word of God you say how do you know God proves it because as we preach the word we see it taking effect we see it producing the word in your lives and that's really where my rest is and so you can imagine that after being so positive that he says it and says it again and says it again even says to his disciples stop following me follow him and then he he gets arrested and circumstances change and he's less sure and what has done that brother Brown says his eagle eyes can you imagine that could happen it could happen to a dispensational messenger so you know a lot of times the devil wants to beat us over the head with our with our with our fightings within and fear fightings without and fears within and Paul Paul admitted he had those fightings without we read it here in a little bit and fears within say I'm going to show you that just in a little bit it's not a cakewalk it's not Disneyland we're not going to a picnic as brother Branham said This Is War this is and this is not against flesh and blood that would be easy I can see who I'm shooting at this is invisible powers of the air and I I can't run away from they follow me they even come to church and try to infect my mind and your mind oh I love the preaching of the Gospel you know why because it cast out devils and it drives back spirits of unbelief and for just a little while I'm able to drive every demon away from you and drive them back so the Holy Spirit can come down and deal with you oh you're talking about an authority that I don't take lightly and I'm not afraid of it because I know it's the word and that's when when something's a revealed truth out of the word of God that's perfect Faith Satan can't challenge me on that see it's a perfect peace and perfect faith I know that this word will find God's family and it will perfect them amen but it must have looked doubtful to him when the circumstances of his life got so bad and you know he could he could no longer see Jesus as clearly as he had when he saw him down on the river you know I mean he's in a church service and man the anointing is thick and his brother gathered around him and here comes the Lamb of God and he's seeing the pillar of Fire wow what a change now he doesn't see the pillar of fires Brethren aren't around him he's in a prison locked up in jail and you know and he's he's he's got the bread of Affliction and and and he he starts to wander and starts to get weary I mean it can happen right amen can say Amen to that it can happen you know a lot of times you know when you know when when I don't always see let me say it like this I don't always see in you the same hopeful face that I see when you're sitting here amening the word of God sometimes I run into you in town and I and I and I see a lot of that faith and a lot of that joy and a lot of that perseverance is kind of starting to get weak and I start praying for you and guess what guess what guess what I don't know I don't always look in the mirror and see the same man that I that was standing here and I say man where's that guy that was anointed I'm here to tell you something friends life has a way of doing that that's when you got to be persevering that's when you got to persevere that's when you got to know that he's God and you know that it's his word and you know that you're a Believer and it doesn't even matter what the devil can point to I know I'm a Believer and you're going to have to be persevering in this day or get wiped out because what's released on this age is the spirit of fear Spirit of Madness Spirit of insanity Spirit of perversion there are so many so many twisting influences in the world today want to influence you want to influence your home want to influence your children you know and and and that's why we preach so hard about you know my goodness you should take every possible opportunity to have yourself and your family in the presence of God I mean why why why would you think that everything will be okay if your family only gets to come into this kind of Atmosphere for about an hour and a half once a week I mean that that's that's ridiculous and it's it's irresponsible and you know you you need to think about what's what's really important to you and what you what you really love you know and and it's hard to it's hard for you to convince me that you love your family correctly when I don't see that happening and they don't love unless they don't love them correctly see so because this is there it's more this is more than a social Gathering I want you to absorb that in your mind this is a supernatural experience you're not just here socially this this church building isn't just a gathering hole that you're coming into an atmosphere where people are singing and worshiping and and God promised when that happens he'll start coming down in the midst of that you're here where the word is going to go forth where there's an anointing that literally in a prophet's words flows off of the platform and move down across the people this isn't just like going to Walmart this is coming into the presence of God [Applause] and it's astonishing that everywhere else you go that's not a token applied area is Satan's Eden and people will kill themselves and spend hard-earned money to go everywhere that Satan's Eden is and can hardly come to church for free and come in and have a supernatural experience so so we we think about the circumstances of our lives and the the promised word you know and the precious promises that are are to us and then I think about the world around us and how it's gotten so much worse you know and and very much like John I mean listen everything I just said for the last seven or eight minutes I'm not trying to browbeat you I'm trying to help you I'm trying to get you to open your I'm trying to I'm trying to to take some of the film that film has filmed over some of our eyes like John I mean Rejoice I'm I'm equating you to John I'm not insulting you I'm equating you to John if you're out there listening on the internet I'm equating you to John John's eagle eyes got filmed over when he couldn't go to church John's eagle eyes a dispensational angel got filmed over when he couldn't have the Fellowship of the Saints around him so I mean am I crazy see am I looking at it wrong wrong I don't think I am see so I'm not trying to bralpy to anybody I'm trying to just just preach to you from some common sense this is an evil day news flash it's an evil day it's Satan's Eden he's the god of the evil age see and so so we find then that you know we our lives can come move in this direction just quite naturally just by living but I'm glad that we have an ability like John to have our thinking corrected by the word because when when John sent Messengers to say to him are you actually him I know I said you were and I said it like three times I even sent my own disciples to follow you but are you really him and Jesus Jesus didn't turn around and say yeah John you know come to your senses man here's my here's my card and I'm Jesus Nazareth I'm your cousin and we met down the river you remember that and you baptized me and remember what came out of the sky no he never he never even went back to none of that stuff he just started quoting the word at what his ministry was supposed to do he said when you go back and see John tell him that the gospel is being preached and the blinded eyes are being opened and the and the and the great things of God and the power of God is moving in the people and Israel is being restored and when John all John needed to hear was yeah that's right it's the word of God yeah he is the Lamb of God I'm here today coming friends take courage because because this word is being fulfilled and the Very promises that were given to this age not I mean I can see the what what the what the prophecy was concerning the world I can see all of those prophecies coming to pass and I also know there was a precious promises uh to the family of God fear not little children it's your father's pleasure to give you the kingdom I know the world is going to pieces I know that it's Satan's Eden but it's the father's pleasure to give you the kingdom there is power in prayer and there's power in the blood and you can rely on it and let me encourage you tonight you can depend on it let me let me say this you can draw from it if you need some dividends tonight your perseverance is a little low and your eagle eyes are filmed over oh let me encourage you by the word of God it's coming to pass all around us we see it happening it gets confirmed to me every day of my life [Music] this message is so far beyond question to me because I see it operating every day every day so we can hear the same confirmation come back like John did this movement is scriptural and it is producing what it said regardless and and sometimes I can find my own self going wow I think yeah okay it's producing in everybody but me anybody anybody been there yes sir so Bill Jason never would have imagined you why who you think I am like Superman only sister Debbie thinks that and my grandkids but I'm actually just a mortal with an immortal Gene had a super faith I have a super seed oh man and I have a perfect faith in it hmm uh Hey Z go to Romans 8 honey uh Romans 8 and we're gonna go 35 to 37. hey man got some girl power going on in the booth now I want you to look at Paul here's here's here's the Apostle Paul in Romans 8 35-37 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter wait a minute Paul I thought what happened to love I thought you were just talking about the love of Christ it's not the turn I expected although we're going to talk about the love of God who's being killed all day and who's a sheep for the slaughter me and you see I want to know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death nay verse 37 and all these things in all of what things being killed all the day long being being accounted as sheep for the slaughter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter you say I feel like I'm being slaughtered it doesn't matter you're gonna win anyhow all you got to do is have perseverance all you got to do is press that word Paul said we press toward a Mark that means we strain at it we stretch we're reaching I'm pressing I'm not sitting back on the couch with the remote I'm actually straining and pressing to take a hold of something [Applause] now in all these things we are more than conquerors I'm being killed all the day long and I'm a conqueror exactly I'm accounted at sheep for the slaughter but I'm a conqueror precisely how because God loved me and nothing can separate me from that love he comes to the Corinthian Church Second Corinthians chapter 11. Zoe second Corinthians 11 we're going to get 21-33 I just want you to I just I'm just going to give you a reality check to show you that Paul's life wasn't a bed of roses I speak as concerning report now the Paul is responding to people who went around tooting their own horn that they were something super and Paul was pretty much nothing Paul says I speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak how be it when so ever any is bold I speak foolishly I am bold also are they Hebrews so am I are they Israelites so am I are they the Seed of Abraham so am I are they Ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I'm more in Labor's more abundant and Stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths often of the Jews five times received I-40 Stripes saved one Thrice was I beaten with rods once I was stoned Thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and a day I have been in the Deep and journeyings often in Perils of waters and Perils of robbers and Perils of my own countrymen and Perils of the Heathen and pales in the city and perils in the wilderness and perils in the sea and perils among false Brethren and weariness and painfulness and watchings often and hunger and thirst and fastings often in gold and nakedness this calls for perseverance besides you know as if I haven't already give you a long enough list besides those things that are without which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches who is weak and I am not weak who is offended and I burn not if I must needs Glory I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities I'm going to glory in my infirmities I'm not going to toot my own horn and talk about some great track record I've got I'm going to Glory that I've been counted worthy to suffer and build my character and I'm more perseverant today than I was before I suffer those things if I must need score verse 35 I must needs Glory I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who is blessed forevermore knoweth than I lie not in Damascus at the governor under art artist the king kept the city of the of the Damascus sins with the Garrison desirous to apprehend me and through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall and escaped his hands I've been to that window I saw the field where our poor brother ran for his life I've walked the street straight I know they were hunting for him and here he is I mean Lord are you kidding I've had all I've had these Stripes this many times I've been in the The Deep a night in the day I've I've suffered robbers and perils and my countrymen and all these things and now here I am in Damascus the place you sent me to and they're coming to kill me and and I got to suffer the indignity I can't even walk out like a man I got to be lowered in a basket like a like a criminal and run off into the darkness and try to find my way man this calls for perseverance I want to tell you some friends let me encourage you tonight be perseverant this isn't a picnic this isn't a vacation this is an exercise in spiritual lifestyle this this is this is you're not as as brother Ernie used to say you're you're not uh uh um uh you're not a natural person having a supernatural experience you're a supernatural person having a natural experience say how do you get to your supernatural being because I was in God before the foundation of the world when morning Stars sang together and sons of God shouted for Joy when they gathered around the throne oh my God second Corinthians 1 chapter 1 7 to 10 see verse 7 and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that is your partakers of the sufferings so shall you be also of the consolation isn't that wonderful for we would not Brethren II Corinthians 1 8 for we would not Brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength and so much we despaired even of life let me tell you something this is Saint Paul this is Saint Paul being vulnerable and saying to you it happens to the best of us to those who you would think it's impossible that Paul could ever get that way where's his faith where was John's where's yours at time where's mine see and he says it was I was so pressed out of measures so above strength it had went so beyond my ability to survive and so much that we despaired even of life verse 9 we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raiseth the Dead who delivered us from so great of death and death delivery in whom we trust that he will yet Deliver Us I'm here to tell you something friends God has a way of getting you to not trust you God has a way of getting you not to fall back on your own resources and try to make your own way God God doesn't want that God wants you to depend upon him and and life comes I'm here to tell you that the beauty of that is this in fact is this is exactly why that this works is what bewilders Satan because he cannot put two and two together and get it to come out he can't write this in an equation on his board that that the the more he powers on you the stronger you get the harder he makes it the more you love God the more you suffer the more faith you have I told you a bunch of weirdos I told you you're not normal I'm here to tell you something friends I'm only not normal because I'm not of this world I Come From Another World I come from God I'm going back to God Hallelujah brother Branham comes to Matthew 15. he picks up this Greek woman Matthew 15 21 to 28 then Jesus went thence and departed into the coast of terenceidon I'm doing good on time is you with me I'm tired and sidon Behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and cried in him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and beside him saying send her away for she cries after us but he answered and said I'm not sent but until the lost sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs it's pretty tough that's Politically Incorrect brother Brandon said you Pentecostals he said man somebody would have treated you like that you'd have took your papers and went to the next Church down the street said I don't have to sit here and listen to this idiot and brother Brandon brother Brown talked about yet you know relating it that people couldn't even stay and hear the word of God verse 27 and she says truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the master's table then Jesus answered and said unto her old woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour brother Branham when he starts to tell the story about this woman he starts talking about the secret to Dueling faith and you know that's what faith really is it's a constant duel it's like a sword fight and and brother Branham talks about you know that you've got a you've got a sword of the word and but the devil's also got a sword right because he comes with a sword remember in the seals he comes with a sword and brother Brennan said we find out he gets killed by that sword see it's sharp two-edged sword puts him right down and so brother brennaman describing this Warfare he says but if you believe it see these swords come right straight down to the handles and now if I in a duel if I can push his back with my handle the handle's locked I'm aiming for his heart he's aiming for mine and our handles lock and he said now it's just the strength of the man's arm who can push who sword into whose chest yeah you follow me so you say well I'm just going to Parry and move no I'm going to tell you something sometimes life gets you in a fix where you can't move left or right you can't go forward or back up and the only thing you better have at that point is an arm of Faith to take the sword of the spirit and put that enemy down Hallelujah say how am I going to do that I'm glad you asked listen to brother Branham he says now if I can push his back with my handle the blade like that where am I at I'm directed right straight to his heart oh sometimes we stab at the Devil but we don't really stab at his heart because really what he's come with in our lives we kind of like it but it's caused us some problems and so we'd like to wound him just to kind of back him up a little bit but don't go away I don't really want to kill you because I kind of like what's going on here but I don't like the trouble that's causing me I remember brother Matt preaching one time about the difference between somebody repenting for the consequence of the sin rather than repenting for the sin people a lot of times are very sorry over the consequence of what sin has got him into but they're really not ready to get rid of the sin and they just kind of want to breather kind of want to reprieve see he says now if I can push his back with my hand the blade like that then I'm I'm directed right straight to his heart because I'm on the right side at his left and and then when I'm pressing with faith with the word see now you get the picture this is a metaphorically it's a sword fight what it is is you say it's a sword it's a metaphorical hand pushing a metaphorical sword into a real devil because it's not just a a metaphor it's actually a reality and the arm is an arm of faith and the sword is the word directed by the spirit so you can put it in his heart that's what you need to do I'm here to tell you some things that we have repeating in our life is because you've never put it to his heart but I want you to know you're entitled to do that you're entitled to put it to his heart you don't just have to wound him he'll just come back put it in his heart tonight whatever's held you back in your life from believing all of God put it in his heart and put him down forever [Applause] and then when I'm pressing with faith with the word Satan Jesus Christ commissioned me to do this and we lock see and so and raise up with that hand of faith and say and here's brother Brandon because of his personal testimony we've all got our own personal line we could use here's his an angel of God met me Yonder and said it so the first thing you know throws the sword right straight in and he's conquered I come to challenge you and thus saith the Lord that's the believer when he has Faith to handle the word I'm here to tell you something that's what brother Branham says in the fourth seal that he says you wait till that group comes that that seven Thunder Group that can and brother Branham doesn't say handle the word go look at it go listen to the team he doesn't say handle it he says that group that can hand it in other words I can put it in my hand and I can duel and I can shove it into the heart of the enemy I'm a capable wire because I've I've said in the presence of the mighty king he says this poor little woman she had never seen him but she had heard of him she had many hindrances I love this statement she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any hindrances catch this now Faith don't have any hindrances at all not faith see she had hindrances it's going to prove to you here in just in a minute I'll give you a little preview of what's coming brother Brown is going to prove that faith and your and the things that are hindering you are are different you see because she had hindrances talks Hey brother I'm goes into a whole list you know her church was against her going to see him her husband was against her going to see him the neighbors her social parties were against him against her she had her own internal fears and questions and wonderings she's now got a got to be insulted and almost spit in the face and she's got to overcome all of those human emotions and hindrances there are people that can't even hear God say to them about how they should dress there are women who get modern matter than a firecracker when you start talking about Holiness about how women should dress and how she shouldn't dress are men how they shouldn't run around town dressed in certain ways or act certain ways or say certain things and they will get so mad they want to fight you this woman had to almost have her face spit in and yet she kept the right attitude and said truth Lord in other words you said I'm a dog you're not wrong truth I'm Unworthy of this but nonetheless I'm so desperate how they even the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table now you've got that kind of attitude friends I'm here to tell you that's when you'll move God on your behalf that's when you'll move God on your own behalf when all you do is sit back and get mad and want to call a preacher and tell him off or text him and tell him off or you know come see him and tell him off then you're never going to get what this woman got I'm sorry that's the reality you're never going to get what this woman got see says this poor little woman she had plenty of hindrances but her faith didn't have any hindrances because Faith don't have any hindrances at all you might have a lot of hindrances you might have a doctor's word scientific man who's examined who it might be that man told you you're going to die that's all he knows he told you all he studied his scientific work shows that you must die your whole system is made in that kind of a way that death has struck it and there's nothing can keep it from going on you're going now that's as much as he knows no science has no medicine for it but you have found something you pick up the sword see of course you've got a hindrance of course you've got a hindrance you've got something that's going to duel against you the devil that disease that Affliction sometimes friends you can go for a long time and your whole life is just made up of a duel of the devil or a disease or an Affliction but I want you to know this word has the answer for a devil or a disease or an Affliction this is a bride who's going to come overcome every devil and every disease and every Affliction and Satan's Eden is not going to hold me back I'm going to conquer every devil and every disease and every affliction foreign when you strike the tip of the swords with that devil Yonder say thus saith the Lord he revealed to me and I am healed oh my your faith don't have any hindrances oh friends can you realize that tonight there's where perseverance lays is that my faith does not have any hindrances it's been revealed to me what God is doing in my life if God promised me that if I would surrender he'd fill me full of his life and he would take away the desires of the world and guess what he did I I did it he did it here I am Hallelujah he told me he warned me the world would go crazy but he promised me his mind and I've got it and I know it's true she had hindrances but not her faith so her faith is something more than her her faith is beyond her it was a revelation given by God that drove her past all her hindrances perseverance the hindrance his brother Branham listed were outside of her some of them were within her Paul picks that up so he gave me second Corinthians chapter 7. Paul Thomas let's let's look at some more reality check about Saint Paul just so you know he wasn't on holiday second Corinthians 7 4 and 7 4-7 great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you I am filled with Comfort savior this sounds pretty good I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation for when we were coming to Macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears think about that friends can you relate to that can you say I get it Paul I've been right there I was there all day today fightings without I've troubled on every side all I want to do is finish my day and love my family and go to church and worship God but I've had troubles on all sides I've got fightings everywhere I turn I got fears within me say what kind of fears you got you know am I making the grade am I good enough am I righteous enough does God really love me come on friends this is this is Paul being a human this is Paul being vulnerable are you willing to say me too me too I have all kinds of trouble on every side and fightings without it I got a lot of fears within but look what he says nevertheless verse six nevertheless God that comforted those that are cast down comforted Us by the coming of Titus and not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us of your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that I rejoiced the more it didn't matter how bad Satan troubled him all Paul had to hear was there are people who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ oh that's reward enough for me friends I don't need plotted from the world as long as I know you love the Lord Jesus Christ I can face every demon I can fight every tool as long as I know I got people who love God and who want more of his word and who are willing to be perseverant young people who are willing to stand up and say brother Jason we're with you we're marching to Zion married couples who say we're with you we're marching to Zion [Applause] how about on the internet are you willing to march on to Zion brother Brandon makes a tremendous point he says listen you say well but man this problem and that problem and yeah I get it mother Jason I'm excited this is a great place to be tonight and I'm a Believer too but you know the bottom line is let's just be real I got this problem here and this one here this one over here and I'm still gonna have to face them tomorrow you know well first of all I think I've shown you you're not alone I think I have shown you from the days of Paul till today till tonight we are all in this thing together I started yet John the Baptist and brought you through Jesus we didn't talk about his torment and then we get to Paul and Paul's writing all of these places Hey listen this ain't a picnic this ain't a vacation uh you know I'm not I'm not a holiday in sightseeing I got trouble on every side and I got people trying to kill me and and I go I'm pressed beyond measure and I got fightings without and fears Within but brother Branham said yeah you got all these you got all these hindrances but just remember you've already already overcome the biggest hindrance say which one was that you got born again you're talking about impossible that's impossible because the Fallen mind is enmity against God and can never agree with God's word you came into this world dying with no way to save yourself and nobody in heaven or Earth could save you but God rich in Mercy offered you himself and you took the deal Hallelujah you took the deal and said oh I'll take the way with the Lord's despised you and what did it do it changed your nature and the old man died and you're loving God tonight I'm here to tell you if you put all the rest of your hindrances in a box they would not equal what you've already accomplished [Applause] so now let me say to you it's worth pressing it's worth persevering I want to tell you tonight press the battle it's worth it you're already winning [Applause] Hallelujah brother Branham said faith see it's this this approach of faith and the application of allowing God's grace to do what it does which is produce perfect faith in you these These hindrances are on purpose they're planted you're set up because God is growing you and strengthening you see you've already beat the one that counts and once you beat that one nothing else counts anyway brother Branham said somehow somehow somehow faith finds a source but others don't see I just about took a run when I read that brother man says faith finds a source can you relate to that tonight I've been so many cases in my life so many times so many situations there was no way out there was no way over it no way around it no way under it couldn't get through it completely cut off and trapped but Faith found a source say how did you find it I don't even know it wasn't natural it was Supernatural Faith finds a source that others don't see she had many hindrances this little greek woman but her faith didn't have any he repeats it Faith don't have any hindrances at all listen to this statement you believe a prophet you believe him if I read you something he said you believe it wouldn't you I'm about to give you Dynamite I'm about to give you a hydrogen bomb for the devil you want it yeah you ready yeah you sure you sure there is nothing can hinder faith don't care what anybody else says here's a prophet saying I don't care what anybody else says here's a man who stood there in Mexico when a dead baby was raised here's a man who's standing in Africa when blinded Eyes Are Open here's a here's a man who's praying one prayer and twenty thousand notable Miracles take place and get recorded in one prayer thirty thousand people come to Christ here here this is the man who who saw these kind of things he's standing I was listening to him in one in one of the perseverance sermons today and he says he's in a piece comes to a prayer line at the end of it at the last perseverant um somewhere in 64. I can't remember and he he's got a woman and he's starting to talk to her you know she sounds she's a she he's already talked about how she's a a nice lady and and she's a real Christian and you can tell she's really sincere have we ever met while I was in one of your meetings in in ninth you know in 1940 something oh but you and I have never met personally no no okay well and he starts to talk he says now you've got a situation here and he goes I didn't guess that don't think that he says you thought I guessed that he said let's see if let's see if see if I guess this and he starts going on down the line and all of a sudden her human her human uh Frailty started going away and Faith started rising up he didn't rebuke her he didn't throw out of the prayer line how dare you oh I'm gonna tell you something friends this is a man who could who could make the statement to you there is nothing that can hinder faith he calls out a man at the back says you sir young young man he says and he goes into his life about about what he's there for and what's going on with him and he says oh but he says you want me to tell you a great thing about you and I'm thinking wow this guy must be like a missionary or something he goes the greatest thing about you is you're a sinner and he said you're a backslider and he says would you like to come back you do you want to come back come up here and the man walks up there and he says your sins are forgiven you and he says oh you say who who told you that his sins were forgiven he said the same one told me his name and told me what was wrong with him he told me to tell him your sins are forgiven oh Hallelujah friends I'm here to tell you that same Prophet said there's nothing can hinder faith faith has no hindrances why don't you just be a believer in the word of God tonight and say it doesn't matter what circumstances what hindrance is I'm a Believer in the word and I'll take the sword and I'll put it at this time I'm going to put it in the heart of that enemy oh do you love him tonight friends let's stand our feet and say I'm a Believer tonight I take the sword of the spirit and I plunge it into the heart of the enemy I will not leave this building with him alive me or him once dying Hallelujah I'm a Believer tonight friends oh oh Brandon says faith is there Faith don't have any hindrances there's nothing can hinder faith I don't care what anybody else says nothing hinders faith what am I trying to say to you friends what am I trying to say to you friends he says we're going to have a prayer line here one of these nights I want I want to see not one stretcher one wheelchair one crutch nothing but what's laying here on the floor and then people walking on out unless you come with the right kind of approach you're not going to get anything that's right you're just walking right through and somebody's slapping you on the hand and you're going out and that's no good you got to know what your come he that cometh to God Must Believe he says tonight friends won't we be perseverant what do you say what do you say Bethel Tabernacle why don't we be perseverant can't we press through and here's a term that is strange I'd never heard him say this can't we press through the Mystic dark shingles here and accept Jesus Christ as our healer can't you do it he asked the question here's a prophet going off the air can't you do it these Mystic dark shingles I thought you know the only purpose I know of shingles is to keep water out keep rain out and here's a here's a prophet trying to say listen there's we're not talking about a natural rain we're talking about a reign of the spirit and we're not talking about physical shingles three tab whatever architectural knows no we're talking about we're talking about Mystic dark spirits that are trying to keep the rain from falling down upon you oh why don't you raise up today and to say Lord move all those Mystic dark shingles let's raise up our hands all over

it today and the next day I'm going to continue to believe it and Lord no matter I've got this hindrance and this fight and this thing going on but I found out in the word hey I'm supposed to have those things they're for my perfecting they're to make me strong they're to God you're you're defeating the devil you've you've given us the privilege to defeat the enemy our enemy and your enemy on
