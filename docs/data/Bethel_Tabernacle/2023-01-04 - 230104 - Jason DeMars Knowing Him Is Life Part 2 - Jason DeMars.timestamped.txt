[23:51] earn back the home front is what I feel
[23:53] like Anyway probably not true but sort
[23:57] of what I feel like I've been gone so
[23:58] much and it's been a crazy six months
[24:01] and
[24:02] just thankful to be back

[24:27] and
[24:28] tribulations and and some tremendous
[24:31] blessings
[24:32] as well
[24:33] and
[24:35] the main the main thing comes down to
[24:37] how we approach it in our attitude
[24:38] towards it and so uh we understand these
[24:43] are things our promised to us in the
[24:44] scriptures very clearly
[24:46] and so give thanks amen and everything
[24:50] give thanks just let that be in your
[24:52] heart I know that's easy to say over the
[24:56] pulpit and to preach about but to have
[24:58] our hearts
[25:00] changed and set in that direction where
[25:03] trials difficulties come and we say
[25:06] thank you Lord I'm so blessed I'm so
[25:09] blessed amen
[25:11] I want to speak on knowing him his life
[25:14] part two I did this in Sunday school
[25:16] before and and just want to continue on
[25:19] the same subject
[25:21] um
[25:24] we'll take prayer requests of course at
[25:26] the end of service and if I don't go too
[25:28] long maybe a testimony or two so uh
[25:33] or opening scriptures in John chapter
[25:35] 17.
[25:37] and it's verse 3.
[25:41] very familiar verse
[25:43] to us all
[25:46] this is Jesus
[25:48] in his prayer of intercession
[25:51] before going to Calvary
[25:54] and in his prayer he says in this his
[25:57] life eternal
[25:59] that they might Know Thee the only true
[26:02] God
[26:03] and Jesus Christ whom thou ascent
[26:06] amen let's pray Heavenly Father we come
[26:09] before you now Lord and oh we're so
[26:11] thankful that we know you
[26:14] we're so thankful that you've come to us
[26:16] and and you revealed yourself to us and
[26:19] made yourself known in such a
[26:20] supernatural
[26:21] way in our lives Lord and in such a real
[26:24] way on a daily basis father I pray that
[26:27] you'd take the words
[26:29] spoken tonight Lord and write them on
[26:31] our hearts
[26:33] Lord just help us all to rest in your
[26:36] presence Lord and just relax our hearts
[26:39] and minds and receive a blessing and
[26:43] encouragement from from you Lord and a
[26:45] challenge from you as well
[26:46] we we asked Lord that you'd help us to
[26:49] get out of the way understand there's
[26:52] many things going on and all of our
[26:54] lives and and things that were are on
[26:57] our mind but Lord let us just take a a
[27:00] few minutes here
[27:02] to lay those aside Lord we want you to
[27:06] come
[27:07] Lord and take these lips and speak into
[27:10] your people's lives I just submit and
[27:13] surrender myself to you Lord use use me
[27:16] use each one of us as you see fit
[27:17] tonight we ask in Jesus name amen God
[27:21] bless you can be seated
[27:26] in the least expanded translation
[27:29] this verse he says and this is life
[27:31] eternal life namely that they might they
[27:33] might be having an experiential
[27:36] knowledge of you the only genuine God
[27:39] and of him you sent on a mission Jesus
[27:42] Christ and I just want to take a moment
[27:45] to emphasize on that portion having an
[27:48] experiential
[27:50] knowledge of you I I find
[27:53] that whole phrasing
[27:55] fascinating because it's not uh it's not
[27:59] looking at a past tense or just a moment
[28:03] but it's a ha it's having
[28:06] that's a process right having and so if
[28:11] you're going to have
[28:12] the knowledge knowing of God it's an
[28:17] experiential
[28:18] it's something that you experience in
[28:20] your own personal life him changing you
[28:23] him transforming you him living in your
[28:26] life and it's not just a momentary thing
[28:28] it's not at the camp meeting it's not at
[28:31] the Revival it's not at the tremendous
[28:34] uh services that we have but it's on a
[28:37] on a daily basis through the grind
[28:40] through the difficulties through the
[28:42] trials that you get in experiential
[28:44] knowledge
[28:46] of him and it's not enough to have it
[28:48] past tense
[28:49] in a moment I I know I knew him no I
[28:54] know him
[28:55] I I am knowing him
[28:58] I think
[29:00] I think I think of myself sometimes you
[29:02] can come to a place where you feel like
[29:04] you know the message has been revealed
[29:06] and you study and you see things and you
[29:07] feel like oh my the Lord's really helped
[29:10] me to know so many different things and
[29:12] you don't say that in Pride but just in
[29:14] thankfulness
[29:16] oh
[29:19] I'm getting to the hook
[29:22] then you come to reach a point many
[29:24] times in your life and say Lord
[29:29] what's happening
[29:30] I don't understand what is taking place
[29:34] circumstances in life leave me feeling
[29:37] like I'm in in darkness and confusion
[29:40] and you say Lord I'm extending my hand
[29:43] Lord where are you I can't find you oh
[29:45] that's the that's the humbling down that
[29:47] the Lord does
[29:49] you I'm extending my hand where are you
[29:51] and he says I'm holding you
[29:54] I'm holding you oh you're holding me
[29:58] yes you are that's what the word says
[30:01] you can know a lot about God
[30:06] but you can know God very little
[30:09] that's an important distinction to make
[30:11] knowing facts about God
[30:15] from the Bible absolutely encourage
[30:18] everyone to know your Bible from Genesis
[30:20] to Revelation backwards and forwards
[30:22] every part of it you should feed on it
[30:24] you should fill your mind with it
[30:26] continually and you should remember as
[30:28] you're reading it that's Limited
[30:31] we are limited and knowing this book on
[30:36] a human level is limited but God is
[30:39] unlimited
[30:40] and so we know him by we understand this
[30:42] this is message 101 you know him by
[30:46] spiritual revelation
[30:48] not by figuring out who God is we want
[30:50] to bring up that PowerPoint Brother Brad
[30:53] not not by and go to the next screen he
[30:57] said well you just don't know your Bible
[30:59] I said well that may be so but I know
[31:01] the author real well I said that's it
[31:04] you know it doesn't say to know his book
[31:05] but to know him his life see Satan knows
[31:08] his word but to know him the author of
[31:11] the word
[31:13] see
[31:14] brother Brandon is not telling you don't
[31:16] know your Bible and he's not even really
[31:18] telling you he doesn't know the Bible
[31:19] the other fella was telling brother
[31:22] Branham he didn't know his Bible it's
[31:25] not a fact he did know the Bible and
[31:27] brother Branham never encouraged he's
[31:29] not using this quote to encourage
[31:32] ignorance of your Bible what is he what
[31:35] is he saying though
[31:36] get it in the right order
[31:39] you you can know a lot of facts about
[31:41] your Bible
[31:43] and be so twisted up in theology that
[31:46] you don't know anything about God or
[31:48] let's bring it to this you can be so
[31:50] twisted up in message Doctrine
[31:53] from this group and this group and this
[31:56] group and never have come to know God
[32:00] personally know the author first
[32:04] know him by Supernatural Revelation
[32:07] something that's on the inside of the
[32:10] inside
[32:14] it's it's it's it's it's not I miss this
[32:18] portion and I don't want to miss miss it
[32:20] it's not just knowing him at a special
[32:24] meeting
[32:25] or when you feel really good about
[32:27] things
[32:28] everybody get that out of your mind
[32:30] wonderful to have a great service
[32:32] wonderful to shout and dance in the
[32:34] service I want to do it more and more
[32:36] and more and more and more
[32:39] but
[32:40] what about when you're feeling is so low
[32:44] what if what about when you're at home
[32:46] and the kids are driving you crazy
[32:49] and the spouse is driving you crazy and
[32:52] you're driving yourself crazy
[32:55] what about then
[32:57] do we know him
[32:59] do we slip aside and say Lord give me
[33:02] strength in this moment because you can
[33:05] you can be the greatest dancer
[33:08] and Runner around the church but without
[33:11] knowing him personally
[33:14] in your soul it means nothing
[33:17] it's a sounding brass and a tinkling
[33:19] symbol
[33:22] it's a continual Fellowship of knowing
[33:25] god more and more and deeper and deeper
[33:28] and it's a burning passion that follows
[33:30] you
[33:31] every day every morning
[33:34] and it continues birthing itself out of
[33:37] you and it's up and down and there's
[33:39] lots of up and downs and there's lots of
[33:41] times where the passion is lower and the
[33:44] passion is higher but there's passion
[33:48] there's passion in your whole mind and
[33:50] your whole heart is on the Lord
[33:52] continuously
[33:54] you you might be struggling you might be
[33:56] suffering but you're thinking about God
[33:58] God where are you at in this where am I
[34:01] at in this that's where your heart is
[34:03] it's not about you got it all figured
[34:05] out on every in every circumstance and
[34:07] every place
[34:10] God has so fixed our life that we have
[34:13] to trust in him
[34:14] that he does things that causes us to
[34:17] say
[34:19] what what is happening why is this
[34:22] happening and we have to trust him we
[34:24] have to say Lord I believe who you are I
[34:28] believe in what you're doing believe
[34:30] your word is true
[34:32] that's why faith is the key it's not
[34:35] knowledge
[34:37] knowledge only goes so far knowledge can
[34:40] take you real far and then the next
[34:41] thing you know you're what what happens
[34:44] to your knowledge when it's that is
[34:46] challenged when God doesn't act
[34:47] according to your theology
[34:50] in your own human life
[34:52] when God does things that disappoint you
[34:58] what are you preaching about this guy
[35:00] because I'm I've been there and we've
[35:04] all been there God will do things and
[35:07] you'll be disappointed in what you think
[35:10] God was supposed to be doing
[35:15] and you'll be upset and you'll be
[35:16] frustrated and be mad
[35:18] let's just be real with each other
[35:21] that's why knowledge will only take you
[35:24] so far
[35:25] you've got to have a submissive heart
[35:28] you've got to come to that place when
[35:30] all your knowledge runs out and you say
[35:33] I have no idea what's happening right
[35:35] now
[35:35] and I don't know why it's happening you
[35:37] say Lord I bow my head and I bow my
[35:40] knees and say I trust you
[35:45] it's easy to trust the Lord at the Youth
[35:47] Camp
[35:49] it's fun it's wonderful it's great
[35:51] that's only once a year
[35:53] it's easy to trust God at the special
[35:55] meetings a couple times a year if you're
[35:57] if you're blessed and fortunate to be
[35:59] able to be at them you got to trust God
[36:02] every day you've got to trust him in
[36:04] those moments where you have no idea
[36:07] what's happening or why it's happening
[36:14] why did God create us
[36:16] why did he make us
[36:18] why are we here God created man
[36:21] and his purpose was for us to know him
[36:25] and as a result worship him that's a
[36:28] very simplified view every denomination
[36:30] would agree with that goes even further
[36:32] than that God by his very nature had
[36:35] attributes within himself
[36:37] one are attributes of who he is as a
[36:41] person
[36:42] secondarily he has attributes which are
[36:45] his elected seed it's what we call him
[36:48] his predestinated seed
[36:49] and he wanted to express both of these
[36:52] attributes he wanted to express the
[36:55] attributes of who he is to the
[36:57] attributes of who he's becoming
[37:00] foreign
[37:01] so the attributes of who he is he's a
[37:03] father he's a savior he's a Healer he's
[37:06] he's just
[37:08] etc etc etc we go down that list I've
[37:11] preached about that before
[37:14] he wants us to know him
[37:17] not just as a fact of lists
[37:20] but in our personal daily life he wants
[37:24] his attributes
[37:26] to come to know his attributes of who he
[37:30] is
[37:32] so his elected seed need to come forth
[37:36] to manifestation who he is needs to come
[37:39] forth to manifestation who he is needs
[37:42] coming forth to a manifestation cannot
[37:44] do so unless you and I
[37:47] come forth to see him manifested
[37:50] so we seeing him manifested fulfills
[37:55] what God wanted to fulfill in his heart
[37:57] for all eternity
[37:59] you you yourself are eternal the thought
[38:03] that he has about you didn't change he
[38:05] didn't come in time and say okay I'm
[38:07] looking out and see I'll choose that one
[38:08] and over this one over here and that one
[38:10] over here you were his life
[38:14] you were in him you were a part of him
[38:18] he saw you every detail I'm gonna get
[38:21] ahead of myself I'm gonna stop there
[38:25] and he wants us to know him by
[38:27] experience by revelation of the word
[38:32] and then by experience in our life it's
[38:34] not enough to know that God had Doctrine
[38:37] perfectly
[38:38] we know have to know the god of the
[38:42] godhead Doctrine personally
[38:45] right he's made it clear he revealed the
[38:49] truth of the godhead in this day so we
[38:50] know him positively and according to
[38:53] scripture
[38:55] wonderful you could have that perfectly
[38:57] lined up
[38:59] from Genesis to revelation
[39:01] great start fantastic I never discourage
[39:04] you from having to from having correct
[39:06] doctrine of God
[39:08] but don't stay right in that position
[39:11] get to know that God on a personal level
[39:15] foundational level on a daily basis
[39:18] remember it's having experiential
[39:21] knowledge of him
[39:23] it's a process it's continual it's daily
[39:27] and that's where he wants us that's
[39:29] where worship that's why there's only
[39:31] one provided place of worship
[39:33] right because it's his attributes
[39:37] worshiping him his him in the
[39:41] manifestation of his attributes
[39:46] you can follow me that's that's
[39:47] complicated on so many levels but as
[39:49] message Believers I think you got it we
[39:51] his attributes must see him in his
[39:55] attributes of who he is just righteous
[39:59] etc etc and not just in a book
[40:03] got to see it in the book
[40:05] it's all based on that book but it's got
[40:07] to come and we've got to see it day by
[40:10] day in our life and then from that
[40:13] worship Him
[40:15] when things look contrary to that we
[40:19] worship him anyways
[40:20] in our mind we think how is this
[40:22] consistent with God's attributes you say
[40:25] God you are true though every man is a
[40:28] liar I trust you and I believe you I
[40:31] know you see then from the beginning I'm
[40:33] confused by this thing that's happening
[40:35] that's all right
[40:37] that's all right let's keep walking
[40:38] let's keep going forward and that's the
[40:41] that's the whole scripture I just I just
[40:43] brought to you the whole Plan of
[40:45] Redemption the whole Plan of Salvation
[40:47] and God's whole purpose
[40:49] for us in our lives
[40:54] let's make it clear Philippians 3 verse
[40:56] 10.
[41:02] do we have somebody back there who is
[41:04] pulling up a scripture
[41:08] AWOL Brother Brad
[41:12] Philippians 3 10 old school
[41:14] get out your Bible
[41:16] the three of you that have it
[41:20] if you don't have a Bible get your phone
[41:22] and pull up Philippians 3 10. we're
[41:24] going to spend some time on this
[41:34] all right
[41:37] that I may know him
[41:39] and the power
[41:41] of his resurrection
[41:46] wonderful
[41:48] that's not the whole verse I kind of
[41:51] wish it was
[41:53] because the other part is is difficult
[41:57] and Paul and Paul you know I wish you
[42:00] would have
[42:00] for listening Paul I wish you would have
[42:02] left this part last part off
[42:05] but we would have a major problem if we
[42:07] did
[42:09] if God
[42:11] could have made a better world for his
[42:15] attributes to live in he would have
[42:18] right
[42:20] in order for God to express himself and
[42:23] to express the nature of his attributes
[42:26] there needed to be evil
[42:31] to bring out the very best from himself
[42:33] and to bring the very best out from us
[42:37] his their needed to be evil exist
[42:44] God will never be able to express the
[42:47] fullness of his nature
[42:49] without evil existing and combating
[42:52] against him
[42:53] you will never be able to express the
[42:57] fullness of the nature that God made you
[43:00] to be without troubles and trials and
[43:04] Evil coming into your life
[43:07] Adam knew
[43:10] God in power
[43:13] even in the garden
[43:15] he could speak
[43:17] and it would just come he could adjust
[43:19] nature just by his spoken word
[43:23] but
[43:24] it wasn't enough
[43:26] God had to bring a test
[43:30] it wasn't random there was there wasn't
[43:32] just a random thing that he put the true
[43:35] trees in the midst of the garden I know
[43:37] those aren't literal trees but you know
[43:39] what I'm saying
[43:40] it wasn't random that God made a serpent
[43:43] that could walk on two feet that could
[43:46] communicate that could reason and that
[43:49] could put a seed
[43:51] inside of Eve God made it thus God made
[43:55] an angel
[43:57] that could fall in Pride
[43:59] and he did fall in Pride and he rebelled
[44:01] against God and everything that God is
[44:03] then that angel
[44:06] took on a form that was possible to take
[44:08] on through
[44:10] the serpent
[44:11] brought forth Cain brought forth sin and
[44:14] evil into the world through the human
[44:17] race God made Adam Eve in such a way she
[44:21] could be deceived he made Adam so that
[44:23] he would take her back and throw the
[44:25] whole world into sin
[44:27] God did that purposefully he ordained
[44:31] that that would be that way because that
[44:35] is the best world for him to express
[44:37] himself in and through
[44:40] if he could have made it bad if it would
[44:41] have been better to stay Eden the whole
[44:43] time we'd still we'd be in Eden
[44:46] but it wasn't God's purpose for us to be
[44:49] in Eden he put a test there
[44:51] and he puts a test in all of our lives
[44:55] and that's his purpose
[44:58] in order to bring out all that he is and
[45:01] all that you are
[45:03] it would never happen in Eden
[45:06] couldn't happen in Eden so this idea
[45:09] that that of Pros the Prosperity Gospel
[45:12] and you just you just give and God is a
[45:16] vending machine you put money in and you
[45:19] know put a dollar in a hundred dollars
[45:21] comes out
[45:22] and so on and so forth sometimes
[45:24] God will do that many times God says
[45:27] thank you that's in your account in
[45:28] heaven you'll see it later
[45:31] and it's multiplying
[45:37] sometimes you give and give and give and
[45:39] then you get kicked in the teeth
[45:42] it's true
[45:45] God's purpose is for those things
[45:48] because he's going to bring out of you
[45:51] the very very best fragrant beautiful
[45:56] odor
[45:57] to express him Adam knew him in power he
[46:01] could speak to Creation it would obey
[46:03] him he was innocent he wasn't mature
[46:07] he was still in a position of being in
[46:10] innocence he he wasn't perfect
[46:13] sinless yes
[46:15] but not mature
[46:17] and so he took the testing and trial and
[46:21] and and and and all that went with it
[46:25] to produce
[46:27] it was a God God wanted it to produce
[46:30] maturity knowing
[46:33] and ordaining
[46:35] that he would fall because he had a
[46:37] greater maturity that needed to be
[46:40] produced
[46:41] all right
[46:43] again I want to emphasize God this is
[46:46] the very best world
[46:48] God could make to express himself
[46:51] through you say oh there's so much sin
[46:54] how can you say that all the evil and
[46:56] terrible things that go on okay
[47:00] all right we'll go down that road for a
[47:02] second of philosophy
[47:03] because let's let's call that what it is
[47:06] it's philosophy
[47:07] it's using using human logic to try to
[47:12] disprove what the word of God clearly
[47:15] tells us right
[47:17] philosophy says how could God be good if
[47:21] evil exists how could there be evil
[47:25] according to what you've said
[47:27] if God doesn't exist because if there is
[47:30] something that's bad there has to be a
[47:33] lawgiver that defines what is good and
[47:35] bad God created you and I in such a way
[47:38] that we are constantly judging between
[47:40] good and evil the the the the biggest
[47:44] atheist
[47:45] and the filthiest sinner is judging
[47:48] between good and evil it's usually
[47:50] perverted understanding what good and
[47:52] evil is but nevertheless they're judging
[47:54] between good and evil they've got it
[47:56] usually flipped around
[47:58] but they're still they're judging you
[47:59] for being evil because you say they're
[48:03] evil
[48:04] is perverted
[48:05] say they're a bunch of perverts
[48:07] homosexuals and uh gender bending idiots
[48:14] it's evil it's flat out it's it's flat
[48:17] out evil and now I said that I am evil
[48:19] and I should be canceled you know this
[48:22] is what this is the this is the world it
[48:24] but it shows within themselves their
[48:27] excuse inexcusable as the Bible says o
[48:29] man thou that judges
[48:31] for you that judge or you condemned
[48:34] yourself you're doing the very same
[48:36] things
[48:37] you're claiming others to do so he
[48:39] placed that conscience between good and
[48:41] evil so that we would judge according to
[48:43] that therefore there's a lawgiver
[48:45] there's a God that created everything
[48:48] so we're still back in the place that
[48:50] there's good and there's evil
[48:53] well
[48:55] how can God do that
[48:58] who are you that replies against God
[49:00] that's Paul's answer shall the thing for
[49:03] him say to him that formed it why have
[49:04] you made me thus hath not the Potter
[49:07] power over the clay to make one of the
[49:09] same lump one vessel into honor and one
[49:11] unto dishonor yes God has the right to
[49:15] do that
[49:16] and he has done it
[49:18] and he is he says behold I create good
[49:22] and I create evil
[49:25] God is not responsible for evil he's not
[49:27] personally responsible for evil the
[49:30] devil is and we are
[49:32] yet he he made it this world in such a
[49:35] way that there would be evil there he
[49:38] did that on purpose because that is the
[49:40] best way to manifest himself and
[49:44] manifest his life in you and through you
[49:48] I don't want you to lose that point it's
[49:50] so important when we're looking at all
[49:53] of this
[49:53] it's not it's not about having an easy
[49:56] perfect life
[49:59] I'm blessed
[50:01] I am blessed
[50:03] but the question is when you're down
[50:06] when this when when when the troubles
[50:09] are there when you can't pay your bills
[50:12] on time when you can't
[50:14] do what you want to do because you're
[50:16] struggling
[50:17] are you blessed then to still
[50:21] are you you believe that you are I
[50:24] believe that I am contrary to all sight
[50:26] and vision
[50:28] and what my life is telling me whatever
[50:30] it might be I believe that I am blessed
[50:33] because God's word said so
[50:37] and not only that I feel that in my
[50:39] heart I'm not just saying that I feel
[50:41] that in my heart genuinely
[50:49] God knows the ones that are his
[50:52] second Timothy 2 19 I'm going to read
[50:54] that quickly nevertheless the foundation
[50:56] of God's stand is sure having this seal
[50:58] the Lord knoweth them that are his
[51:05] he knows he knows who belongs to him
[51:09] I think that's even better
[51:12] than knowing him the greatest thing in
[51:14] All My Life Is Knowing him
[51:17] but even the better best thing in my
[51:19] life is him knowing me because
[51:22] many people know about God and they can
[51:24] be confused and think that they have a
[51:26] personal relationship and know God but
[51:28] as a whole
[51:29] completely different thing to say
[51:32] brother Chris God knows me how can you
[51:35] say that well let me tell you let me
[51:39] walk you through my life let me tell you
[51:40] my testimony let me tell you what
[51:42] happened yesterday and the day before
[51:44] and what's happening today he knows me
[51:48] that's the best
[51:51] that's the greatest thing
[51:53] he knows them that are his and the worst
[51:59] words you can imagine depart from me you
[52:01] that work iniquity I never knew you they
[52:04] knew plenty about him because they were
[52:06] casting out devils in his name
[52:08] I knew a lot about him
[52:10] but they didn't know him and he says I
[52:13] didn't know you oh sure he knew the fact
[52:16] that they exist but he didn't know them
[52:20] personally and intimately and didn't
[52:22] call he didn't call them
[52:24] mm-hmm
[52:30] so back to the scripture I didn't get to
[52:32] this point
[52:33] that I may know him in the power of his
[52:35] resurrection and the fellowship of I
[52:37] never even finished reading the the
[52:38] verse did I
[52:40] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[52:42] being made conformable unto his death
[52:48] so if we just know him in the power of
[52:52] his resurrection we don't know him in
[52:55] fullness
[52:58] what if you just know the power
[53:02] you don't know the fullness Adam knew
[53:05] God in power
[53:07] but he did not know the fullness
[53:11] you have to join him in the fellow
[53:15] that's my God that's why I was making
[53:16] that point about evil
[53:18] to know God in fullness
[53:22] you want to go who wants to know God in
[53:23] fullness who believes that the message
[53:25] restores it back to us our capability to
[53:28] know him in fullness I believe that with
[53:30] all my heart
[53:31] then you need the fellowship of his
[53:33] sufferings and being made conformable
[53:35] unto his death there's where you'll know
[53:37] him in fullness
[53:38] Jesus was made perfect by the things
[53:41] that he suffered didn't say Jesus was
[53:43] made perfect by the power that dwelt
[53:45] within him
[53:46] says he was made perfect by the things
[53:48] that he suffered he needed the power I'm
[53:52] not saying we don't need to know him in
[53:54] the power if we don't we don't we only
[53:56] know part of it
[53:57] that's part of it but we need the other
[54:00] part to complete it
[54:02] to be made perfect to be made
[54:04] brought to full maturity
[54:06] by the things that we suffer and when we
[54:10] do that we're made conformable to his
[54:12] death then his life is that power is
[54:16] manifested in fullness through us
[54:20] and so
[54:23] again
[54:26] we we know God he's revealed himself to
[54:30] us you've seen his hand in your life
[54:33] but the best part of that is him knowing
[54:35] you
[54:37] Psalm 139
[54:40] spoke about it last time but there's
[54:41] just so much there
[54:49] Psalm 139 and verse 1.
[54:53] we got it okay great
[54:57] oh Lord
[54:59] thou has searched me
[55:01] and known me
[55:04] thou knowest my down sitting and mine
[55:06] uprising now understandeth my thought
[55:09] afar off
[55:12] so
[55:14] David is not trying to make a fancy
[55:17] speech about God's omniscience
[55:19] omnipotence and omnipresence
[55:22] right
[55:24] David knows that
[55:26] we know that God is omnipotent we know
[55:28] he's omniscient we know he's omnipresent
[55:30] this isn't a theological phraseology
[55:33] that's being brought forth this is a man
[55:38] who is speaking of what he has had
[55:41] revealed in his personal life
[55:45] he's not bringing out a fact a list of
[55:48] gods who God is he's saying
[55:52] this is who I know
[55:54] oh Lord
[55:55] you have searched me and known me
[55:59] this is something that's precious you
[56:02] know you know when I sit down you know
[56:04] when I stand up
[56:06] you understand my thought afar off I
[56:09] think what this means is God isn't afar
[56:12] off I think what it means is youth
[56:14] understand my thoughts long long long
[56:17] long long long before I ever have them
[56:21] thou compassest my
[56:24] path
[56:26] the word compasses literally means to
[56:28] winnow
[56:29] you Widow my path what does that mean it
[56:33] means god is is sifting out every step
[56:38] that you take
[56:40] your whole he's he's another way you
[56:42] would say it in a simple way is he's
[56:44] planning it
[56:45] you plan my path
[56:49] um
[56:50] and my line down
[56:53] and are acquainted
[56:55] with all my ways
[56:57] think about that God knows all your he
[57:00] knows your idiosyncrasies he knows
[57:03] you're good the good about you the bad
[57:05] about you he knows the nature that you
[57:08] have
[57:10] he knows every single intimate detail he
[57:14] knows you better than you know yourself
[57:15] then you think you know yourself
[57:19] every detail
[57:22] for there is not a word
[57:24] in my tongue
[57:26] but O Lord thou knowest it all together
[57:32] that's both encouraging and it
[57:34] challenging at the same time
[57:39] look at this thou Hast beset me
[57:42] behind and before
[57:44] and laid thine hand upon me so he's
[57:48] planned your way
[57:50] and to be beset behind him before it
[57:52] means somebody says in front of you and
[57:55] somebody's behind you and it's God
[57:57] God is in front of you and he's behind
[58:00] you he's planned the way he's winnowed
[58:03] it he's furrowed things he's he's
[58:05] prepared everything just right he's put
[58:08] Hedges of thorns there for you to run
[58:11] into and and for pain to come and
[58:14] difficulties at trials he's put all of
[58:17] those things everything
[58:19] everything that you've gone through
[58:21] every path that you've gone you can't
[58:24] say
[58:24] well I got off the beaten path there I I
[58:27] really uh went the wrong direction
[58:31] well what do you did maybe was wrong but
[58:35] God planned your way
[58:38] don't don't think that you can over
[58:40] you're going to overpower God's plan
[58:44] you're not going to now that doesn't
[58:45] mean that many times
[58:48] we do things that are sinful that are
[58:50] wrong and we have to repent and yet
[58:53] it was it was planned that way
[58:56] come on this is David speaking
[58:58] what did David do
[59:01] things that we don't even want to talk
[59:02] about in front of our children
[59:04] the Bible is open and plain about it
[59:07] adultery and murder and these different
[59:10] things
[59:12] and it's terrible and God ordained that
[59:14] to be that way
[59:16] God didn't commit the evil and he didn't
[59:18] force David to do it David wanted to do
[59:20] it
[59:21] that's not it but God ordained that for
[59:24] David's life so it would be in the Bible
[59:28] so that we would see it and know it and
[59:30] be warned by it
[59:32] and not only that
[59:35] Solomon came
[59:36] and the whole line
[59:38] all the way to Jesus
[59:40] and so God worked intimately in that
[59:44] terrible mistake
[59:46] that was made
[59:47] and laid thine hand upon me so maybe
[59:51] it's great he plans it he sets us behind
[59:54] him before and then he puts his hand
[59:56] right upon us
[59:59] you believe that that's your life
[1:00:01] don't take this as a great theological
[1:00:04] point is this your life
[1:00:10] such knowledge is too wonderful for me
[1:00:14] it is high
[1:00:16] I cannot attain unto it
[1:00:21] look at look at this statement it's
[1:00:25] I mean I I guess you look at it and one
[1:00:27] say why is it confusing to think that
[1:00:30] God
[1:00:31] or difficult to understand God's
[1:00:33] ordained my path he's there in front of
[1:00:36] me behind me has his hand upon me
[1:00:38] because David lived in a life
[1:00:41] full of mess-ups and mistakes
[1:00:43] and he knew his own heart his own
[1:00:45] weakness and that's why it just
[1:00:49] you know this this this verse is uh you
[1:00:52] know if you put it in modern kids talk
[1:00:54] it's the the mind-blown Emoji
[1:01:01] how is it this is incredible
[1:01:04] how is it possible
[1:01:08] I can't hope to figure this all out in
[1:01:10] my lifetime
[1:01:11] it'll take all of eternity
[1:01:14] wither shall I go
[1:01:17] from thy spirit
[1:01:20] or wither shall I flee from thy presence
[1:01:22] now why would you want to do that
[1:01:27] there's times in our lives where
[1:01:29] we get to the place where we're doing
[1:01:31] that
[1:01:32] no no no no no no no not any of you guys
[1:01:35] but me
[1:01:38] me I do
[1:01:40] you guys are strong I'm I'm a little
[1:01:43] weak sometimes
[1:01:46] we all get to that place where we feel
[1:01:48] like what am I what am I doing
[1:01:50] I'm just done I'm just gonna run
[1:01:57] if I send
[1:01:58] what's even more incredible as we go
[1:02:00] forward you'll see this if I stand up
[1:02:02] into heaven you're there we knew that
[1:02:05] if I make my bed in hell
[1:02:08] behold you are there to me when I see
[1:02:10] this as how much God's presence is a
[1:02:15] attached to his predestinated seed
[1:02:18] wherever you go
[1:02:20] he's going with you yeah
[1:02:27] I love this next part
[1:02:29] if I take the wings of the morning and
[1:02:32] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea
[1:02:35] oh
[1:02:37] Jonah
[1:02:38] even there shall thy hand
[1:02:42] be near me
[1:02:44] be around me
[1:02:46] it says actually lead him
[1:02:49] so here you have a man saying I am going
[1:02:51] to run from God he says
[1:02:55] takes off and starts running and God's
[1:02:58] going okay
[1:03:00] you're running
[1:03:02] but I'm leading you there
[1:03:04] I was already leading you there and more
[1:03:07] than that is my right hand is holding
[1:03:10] you the right hand is the hand of
[1:03:13] blessing and mercy so his right hand is
[1:03:16] whole so Jonah says I am not going to
[1:03:20] those Wicked Sinners I'm going the other
[1:03:22] way and God's has him right in his hand
[1:03:25] he's there in the boat he's the he's
[1:03:29] there in the storm
[1:03:31] he's there in the water he makes a fish
[1:03:34] God was there the whole time Jonah did
[1:03:38] Sin
[1:03:40] mm-hmm Jonah
[1:03:44] suffered because of his sin
[1:03:46] and
[1:03:48] God ordained that Jonah would run from
[1:03:52] him
[1:03:53] and God ordained that there would be a
[1:03:55] protection for Jonah even at the same
[1:03:58] time while his wrath was bubbling forth
[1:04:01] towards him
[1:04:04] that doesn't make sense preacher
[1:04:07] it doesn't need to make sense
[1:04:12] who are you that's replying against God
[1:04:15] it doesn't have to make sense it is a
[1:04:17] fact
[1:04:18] it is scripture
[1:04:20] it is this is David's experience running
[1:04:22] from God running running away and
[1:04:26] realizing while he's running he's just
[1:04:28] on a treadmill in God's hand and God's
[1:04:30] carrying for carrying him forward
[1:04:35] this should be
[1:04:38] the greatest thing that you're hearing
[1:04:40] this is so phenomenal this is so
[1:04:43] encouraging to me
[1:04:45] to know all my ups and downs and my my
[1:04:47] failures and my failings that God
[1:04:50] ordained it to be for a purpose
[1:04:56] even there shall I when I'm running I
[1:04:58] mean don't
[1:05:00] don't divorce that from the context
[1:05:03] if I take where where will I run where
[1:05:06] will I run to your hand will lead me
[1:05:08] there
[1:05:09] and your right hand will hold me
[1:05:11] I'm not encouraging you to sin
[1:05:14] I am not encouraging you to run away
[1:05:15] from God it hurts
[1:05:18] it hurts
[1:05:21] sometimes he leads us to those hurts for
[1:05:24] an eternal purpose that we will
[1:05:26] understand better by and by
[1:05:30] if I say
[1:05:32] surely the darkness shall cover me
[1:05:35] I mean
[1:05:36] sometimes we think crazy thoughts don't
[1:05:38] we
[1:05:39] even the night shall be light about me
[1:05:47] have you ever been in that in a dark
[1:05:48] place in your life
[1:05:50] and you think
[1:05:52] I don't have any faith I don't have
[1:05:54] anything I'm I'm I'm done I'm a goner
[1:05:58] and and the Lord says even the night is
[1:06:02] light
[1:06:03] about me about me about me
[1:06:10] isn't that beautiful
[1:06:11] yay the darkness hideth not from thee
[1:06:14] but the night shines as the day the
[1:06:16] darkness and the light are both the
[1:06:18] light to thee
[1:06:21] for thou Hast possessed my Reigns you've
[1:06:24] created my kidneys is what that means
[1:06:27] literally
[1:06:29] kidneys was another way of speaking
[1:06:31] about the innermost thoughts feelings
[1:06:32] Hearts feelings and intents of the Mind
[1:06:37] so not only he
[1:06:40] he doesn't only know them but he created
[1:06:42] the very nature that produces those
[1:06:46] thoughts those feelings
[1:06:48] etc etc so God formed us
[1:06:52] he formed the very nature that you are
[1:06:55] in this very flesh
[1:06:57] the good things and the bad things and
[1:06:59] the and by all of it is there to express
[1:07:03] something very specific in and through
[1:07:06] your life
[1:07:09] you have covered me in my mother's womb
[1:07:12] so that's speaking speaking of I don't
[1:07:15] know all the terminology anymore but all
[1:07:17] the the the
[1:07:20] gooey stuff that's in the in the womb
[1:07:22] and
[1:07:24] the
[1:07:25] the bags of waters I think that's the
[1:07:27] word for God has covered you he's taken
[1:07:31] such
[1:07:32] care
[1:07:33] that he's he's covered you in the in
[1:07:36] your mother's womb don't don't take that
[1:07:39] well he does that for everybody this is
[1:07:40] for me
[1:07:42] God covered me
[1:07:43] when I was still in my mother's womb God
[1:07:47] was covering me and he was CR he was
[1:07:49] creating my kidneys
[1:07:51] literally and figuratively
[1:07:54] he was there I will praise thee
[1:07:57] for I am fearfully
[1:07:59] and wonderfully made that's for every
[1:08:02] single person here and God doesn't make
[1:08:04] any mistakes he made you exactly the way
[1:08:09] you are and he did it with reverence God
[1:08:12] himself had reverence for what he was
[1:08:16] doing in your mother's womb
[1:08:18] he revered what he was doing
[1:08:21] in in your mother's womb
[1:08:27] marvelous this is David hey David just
[1:08:30] calm down a little bit about yourself
[1:08:33] marvelous it's the truth because it's
[1:08:36] for all of us
[1:08:38] marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[1:08:42] knoweth right well
[1:08:44] all right
[1:08:45] God didn't come to build your
[1:08:48] self-esteem he came to build himself up
[1:08:52] in and through you
[1:08:54] but if you want to feel good about
[1:08:57] yourself reads Psalm 1 139 and
[1:09:01] understand that it's written about you
[1:09:03] so no matter what you think you look
[1:09:06] like in the mirror or what is you think
[1:09:08] might be lacking God has made you
[1:09:12] individually marvelous reverently
[1:09:16] and it's and it's marvelous in his sight
[1:09:22] does your soul know that right well
[1:09:26] well
[1:09:27] the devil is totally against
[1:09:31] godliness
[1:09:32] and the devil is totally against
[1:09:36] us
[1:09:37] looking at the right level right
[1:09:40] Satan wants you to be thinking about
[1:09:42] well I feel really down about myself
[1:09:44] self myself is self self self self self
[1:09:47] self and self self self
[1:09:50] why your eyes are on yourself
[1:09:55] but not according to God's word
[1:09:56] according to the worldly standards
[1:09:58] according to what the devil says to you
[1:10:00] instead of looking in the mirror of
[1:10:03] God's word that says
[1:10:05] God formed me and shaped my very nature
[1:10:08] from my mother's womb
[1:10:10] I'm reverently and wonderfully made and
[1:10:13] I'm marvelous
[1:10:16] that's what God's word says young ladies
[1:10:19] when the devil's telling you something
[1:10:21] different God's word says you're
[1:10:22] marvelous and you're fearfully and
[1:10:25] wonderfully made and David says my
[1:10:28] substance verse 15. was not hid from
[1:10:31] thee when I was made in secret and
[1:10:34] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of
[1:10:37] the Earth from the very beginning that
[1:10:40] God made it made brought together a
[1:10:43] sperm and an egg to make an embryo that
[1:10:46] started growing and that whole process
[1:10:48] God was there shaping every aspect of it
[1:10:52] now you say that was just nature it'll
[1:10:56] do it okay that might be true
[1:10:59] for most of the world
[1:11:01] but for the predestinated seed
[1:11:04] God I believe that this is not this is
[1:11:07] speaking about the seed of God
[1:11:10] you say nature does that maybe
[1:11:13] but I I believe in the seed of God that
[1:11:17] God is there overseeing the whole
[1:11:20] process
[1:11:21] and he's watching over that and there's
[1:11:23] an angel there right there and God is
[1:11:26] God is there by his presence watching
[1:11:29] over every aspect and making sure
[1:11:31] everything happens perfectly exactly the
[1:11:34] way he wants to bring it to pass
[1:11:38] Thine Eyes did see my substance yet
[1:11:40] being unperfect it means not fully
[1:11:43] formed
[1:11:45] and in thy book all my members were
[1:11:48] written
[1:11:49] which in continuance were fashioned when
[1:11:52] as yet there was none of them God has
[1:11:56] taken such care about every aspect about
[1:11:58] you that he has literally written every
[1:12:02] one of every one of your members every
[1:12:06] part of your body Soul and Spirit is
[1:12:09] written down in a book before the
[1:12:12] foundation of the world before you were
[1:12:14] ever created
[1:12:15] for all of eternity this was written in
[1:12:18] a book every single detail and he
[1:12:21] doesn't just set in an order but he
[1:12:23] comes and makes sure that every detail
[1:12:25] is taken care of perfectly in you
[1:12:29] so his predestinated scene are going to
[1:12:31] turn out with precision
[1:12:34] the way he wants them to turn out
[1:12:38] how precious
[1:12:40] also
[1:12:42] are thy thoughts unto me o God
[1:12:45] how how great is the somehow vast
[1:12:49] is the sum of them okay how how many
[1:12:53] three thousand
[1:12:57] how many thoughts does God have about
[1:12:58] you
[1:13:00] don't lose track of this you guys
[1:13:03] how many thoughts does God have about
[1:13:05] you and your life
[1:13:07] what meticulous planning has God paid
[1:13:11] for your life for every detail well I
[1:13:13] made a wrong turn here
[1:13:16] I don't believe you did
[1:13:18] I don't believe you did
[1:13:20] believe God has you
[1:13:22] and he's meticulously written out your
[1:13:25] plan
[1:13:26] if you weren't supposed to be here
[1:13:27] tonight
[1:13:29] listening to me
[1:13:31] hopefully keep you awake for a few more
[1:13:33] minutes
[1:13:34] you wouldn't be here
[1:13:36] and there's nothing you could do to
[1:13:38] change that
[1:13:40] absolutely nothing you can do
[1:13:44] how many thoughts does he have how vast
[1:13:47] is the sum of them next verse
[1:13:50] if I should count them
[1:13:53] they're more in number than the sand
[1:13:57] when I awake I am still with thee I mean
[1:13:59] just fathom that our sand here
[1:14:02] out at Hunting Island just grabbing it
[1:14:04] in your hand and start counting and
[1:14:05] you'll just say this is impossible
[1:14:10] in in less than one second you'll throw
[1:14:12] it aside and say it's impossible
[1:14:15] that's how many thoughts
[1:14:17] God has about you so do you think that
[1:14:20] God loves you
[1:14:22] you think that he cares about you
[1:14:25] you think that he's taken in is involved
[1:14:29] intimately in your life
[1:14:32] does he know does he know you do you
[1:14:34] know
[1:14:35] that he knows you we always say do you
[1:14:38] know that you know that you know him but
[1:14:41] do you know
[1:14:42] that he knows you
[1:14:45] because that's vastly more important
[1:14:48] because him knowing you is everything
[1:14:52] Romans 8.
[1:15:00] verse 28 will start
[1:15:05] and I think
[1:15:06] after I've studied this looking at Psalm
[1:15:09] 139
[1:15:10] and then going to Romans 8 I think if
[1:15:13] you understand these sort of as a two
[1:15:16] pieces of a puzzle going together it's
[1:15:18] pretty incredible to see it
[1:15:20] and we know
[1:15:22] that all things work together for good
[1:15:24] to them that love God to them who are
[1:15:26] the called according to his purpose
[1:15:29] again this is not merely
[1:15:31] things just work together for good it is
[1:15:34] God
[1:15:36] is working in all things
[1:15:40] to make them for your good
[1:15:42] again this goes this will go to the
[1:15:45] question
[1:15:46] what is good
[1:15:48] what is actually good right because if
[1:15:52] you think that everything going smoothly
[1:15:54] the mortgage is always paid on time
[1:15:57] every bill is paid on time
[1:16:00] um you never get sick you never have
[1:16:03] struggles you never have trials if you
[1:16:06] think that's good
[1:16:07] then that's not what we're talking about
[1:16:10] and that's not what the word of God is
[1:16:11] talking about
[1:16:13] it's that God is taking all things
[1:16:17] and he's working them for your good so
[1:16:22] the all things contain things that are
[1:16:24] evil right so God is taking the things I
[1:16:28] mean this is this is the story of Joseph
[1:16:30] what you meant for evil God meant for
[1:16:34] good and to save lives
[1:16:36] and so what people meet what the people
[1:16:40] and the devil means for evil
[1:16:43] God harnesses that in your life and he
[1:16:47] turns that around for your Eternal good
[1:16:51] see that's our problem many times as
[1:16:53] we're so focused on the things of this
[1:16:55] life
[1:16:57] God is trying to prepare a people for a
[1:16:59] Rapture for a body change to live in
[1:17:02] eternity right
[1:17:04] the word is coming to to put us into a
[1:17:08] new body that will never die and never
[1:17:10] get sick
[1:17:11] the body we're in now is going to have
[1:17:13] all it's going to get sick it's decaying
[1:17:15] it's in the by the time you reach a
[1:17:18] certain age you're just in the process
[1:17:19] of dying right that you're getting older
[1:17:22] your your your hair is getting gray
[1:17:26] etc etc
[1:17:27] that's that's just that's what happens
[1:17:30] that's what this life is but there's a
[1:17:32] body
[1:17:33] that he's preparing that he's sending
[1:17:35] vitamins for right and I I believe the
[1:17:39] word is that vitamin but I also believe
[1:17:43] the trials and difficulties that we Face
[1:17:46] are also the vitamins if we take them
[1:17:50] if we take them right if we have the
[1:17:51] right attitude we can let those vitamins
[1:17:54] spill out onto the floor that God's
[1:17:56] sending and then he's going to send more
[1:17:57] vitamins
[1:17:58] and he's going to say I'm waiting for
[1:18:00] you to take him
[1:18:02] I'm waiting for you to say Thank you
[1:18:04] Lord
[1:18:06] thank you you're working in and through
[1:18:08] this trial and this difficulty it hurts
[1:18:10] it's not fun deliver me from it you have
[1:18:12] promises in your word and I'm taking
[1:18:14] them as more real than what I'm going
[1:18:16] through here that's how God wants you to
[1:18:19] take his vitamins now that body is
[1:18:22] growing and getting stronger and being
[1:18:24] made ready for us to step into it and
[1:18:27] God is going to have it ready
[1:18:29] there's not going to be one of those
[1:18:32] theophanes and those bodies that God is
[1:18:35] preparing that is not going to be ready
[1:18:38] he will be sure to do it because it's
[1:18:40] his work
[1:18:42] it's what he's promised to do he's the
[1:18:44] shepherd
[1:18:46] so God is working in the things that we
[1:18:49] might call evil to turn them out for our
[1:18:53] Eternal good
[1:18:55] to them who are called called according
[1:18:57] to his purpose for whom he did for no he
[1:19:00] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:19:03] the image of his son that he might be
[1:19:05] the firstborn among many brethren
[1:19:09] so he's gonna he's going he's going to
[1:19:11] conform us he's four new
[1:19:14] this word speaks of four ordained for
[1:19:16] ordaining he's four ordained so he's
[1:19:19] seen it beforehand and ordained it
[1:19:22] and he also predestined so he sees it
[1:19:25] beforehand and then he sets our destiny
[1:19:28] based on what he's seen beforehand so
[1:19:30] what is your destiny to be conformed to
[1:19:33] the image of the firstborn son
[1:19:35] that's both in your character and nature
[1:19:39] but also in a body change you'll have a
[1:19:42] body like unto his glorious body
[1:19:44] right moreover whom he did predestinate
[1:19:47] them he also called so here he's going
[1:19:50] through the process he's pre he's set
[1:19:52] your destiny beforehand
[1:19:55] well here's the process he called he
[1:19:57] calls you who called you the preacher
[1:20:00] yourself
[1:20:01] no God called you
[1:20:04] he presented the gospel before you he
[1:20:07] opened your heart he filled you with the
[1:20:09] Holy Ghost
[1:20:12] them he also Justified
[1:20:15] and whom he justified
[1:20:17] them he also glorified
[1:20:19] what shall we then say to these things
[1:20:24] if God before us
[1:20:26] who can be against us lots of things
[1:20:30] lots of things are against us thousands
[1:20:33] of things are against us it seems like
[1:20:35] day by day
[1:20:37] but who can effectively be against us
[1:20:40] to turn God away from us
[1:20:42] not no one it's impossible
[1:20:50] he that spared not his own son but
[1:20:52] delivered him up for us all
[1:20:54] how shall he not with him also freely
[1:20:57] give us all things if God so ordained
[1:21:01] that he would send his son
[1:21:03] and he sacrificed his son gave him up so
[1:21:06] that he would suffer a terrible death
[1:21:08] ordained him to that death
[1:21:11] if God did that is he not going to do
[1:21:14] everything that is necessary to bring us
[1:21:17] and get us to where we need to be
[1:21:20] yes he will
[1:21:22] that freely give us all things doesn't
[1:21:25] mean you're going to be rich
[1:21:29] it means that he'll he will be all that
[1:21:32] you need
[1:21:36] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:21:38] God's elect tons of demons
[1:21:41] Satan himself lots of people are doing
[1:21:45] that but who can do it effectively
[1:21:47] because it's God that justifies
[1:21:50] no one could do it effectively who is he
[1:21:53] that condemns I mean everybody
[1:21:56] some people in the church are condemning
[1:21:58] me
[1:22:00] for preaching this sermon
[1:22:04] but who can do it effectively
[1:22:07] no one because it's Christ that died yea
[1:22:11] rather that is risen again who's even at
[1:22:13] the right hand of God who also makes
[1:22:15] intercession for us now I want to ask
[1:22:17] you a question what point does Paul lay
[1:22:20] it on you
[1:22:21] in in these verses
[1:22:23] it's up to you to get make it there
[1:22:27] he's laying it all on God
[1:22:29] through Christ all of it
[1:22:35] who shall separate us
[1:22:37] from
[1:22:38] the love of Christ
[1:22:41] now let's understand that in the context
[1:22:44] let's think about Psalm 139 how God
[1:22:48] plans your path besets you behind and
[1:22:50] before lays your hand up lays his hand
[1:22:53] on you even when you're running away
[1:22:55] from him you're simply in his hand
[1:22:57] and he's ordaining that for a purpose
[1:23:00] don't run away from him or unto him
[1:23:03] and but remember you're in his hand
[1:23:07] nothing can separate us from the love
[1:23:10] right you can't separate God has
[1:23:13] predetermined before the foundation of
[1:23:15] the world that he's going to love you
[1:23:16] are you going to change that is someone
[1:23:18] else going to change that there's no
[1:23:20] possibility
[1:23:23] right so who will separate us from the
[1:23:26] love of Christ
[1:23:28] all right so now Paul's going to go into
[1:23:30] some evils
[1:23:32] shall tribulation
[1:23:35] or distress
[1:23:36] or persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:23:39] Peril or sword we read these words
[1:23:42] and they really uh
[1:23:45] disconnect feel like in a way we
[1:23:47] disconnect ourselves from these things
[1:23:49] people in the old days
[1:23:52] went through those things
[1:23:54] we don't really
[1:23:56] face that so let's just uh
[1:23:59] I'm not saying we need to update
[1:24:00] anything but for our understanding is
[1:24:03] shall
[1:24:05] losing your house separate you from the
[1:24:08] love of Christ
[1:24:09] so losing your job
[1:24:11] and losing everything that you have
[1:24:13] separate you from the love of Christ I
[1:24:15] mean let's get real famine what's
[1:24:17] nakedness get some clothes on man
[1:24:25] I think it means inadequate clothes for
[1:24:28] the weather
[1:24:29] thank the Lord we're in South Carolina
[1:24:30] if you're in when you go back to
[1:24:32] Minnesota all clothes are inadequate it
[1:24:35] seems like
[1:24:36] at least that's what it felt like to me
[1:24:43] forgot what it was like to go outside
[1:24:45] and it just hurts
[1:24:50] those things are not going to separate
[1:24:52] us I mean
[1:24:54] Peril sword somebody comes and shoots
[1:24:57] you
[1:24:58] is that going to separate you from
[1:25:00] somebody comes through those doors and
[1:25:01] kills every one of us is that going to
[1:25:02] separate us is that going to be saying
[1:25:04] oh that's a sign that that God didn't
[1:25:06] love them
[1:25:06] nonsense
[1:25:09] it has nothing to do with it oh he
[1:25:13] couldn't pay his bills on time what a
[1:25:14] failure God doesn't love him well maybe
[1:25:16] he is a failure but don't mean God it
[1:25:19] doesn't change God's love
[1:25:22] it it absolutely does not we have to get
[1:25:25] our eyes off of these things and we
[1:25:28] think of well it's a great blessing
[1:25:30] sometimes a lot of money is a big curse
[1:25:34] and so don't we don't don't think that
[1:25:37] just because somebody's got good in this
[1:25:39] life they're so blessed well I'd like
[1:25:41] some of their blessing but you know
[1:25:43] that's not what means
[1:25:46] God's love
[1:25:48] in your life
[1:25:50] sometimes God brings you through very
[1:25:53] hard difficult times and the bills can't
[1:25:57] get paid on time and and
[1:26:00] um
[1:26:00] you can't go grocery shopping when you
[1:26:02] want to and and these different things
[1:26:05] that you know you feel like you need to
[1:26:07] do and yet you you can't do them and and
[1:26:10] God this is God's purpose in your life
[1:26:14] to try your faith
[1:26:16] it doesn't mean he doesn't love you it
[1:26:18] means he does love you
[1:26:20] and so that this this is so critical
[1:26:22] because
[1:26:23] in our day
[1:26:25] are we we have to be closer over there
[1:26:29] Enoch was closer
[1:26:31] over there than he was here so God said
[1:26:34] just come over here Enoch and so we need
[1:26:37] to be getting to this condition where
[1:26:40] our eyes and our heart are fixed in such
[1:26:42] a way
[1:26:43] on where God's love is
[1:26:46] and where our Treasures are
[1:26:49] so that we can God can just say well
[1:26:51] you're just closer over here just step
[1:26:53] on over
[1:26:54] and so God's working that in our hearts
[1:26:57] he's going to work it in our hearts and
[1:26:58] sometimes that means he takes things
[1:27:00] away
[1:27:01] and sometimes that means he he he he
[1:27:04] allows us to be sick and not yield it
[1:27:07] instantly
[1:27:09] and and then you know it's it's he
[1:27:14] allows those things because he wants our
[1:27:15] eyes
[1:27:16] to be on eternity
[1:27:20] and he wants us to be thinking more
[1:27:23] about sending things on vitamins ahead
[1:27:26] to that body
[1:27:28] than on building the Here and Now
[1:27:32] and being comfortable and things being
[1:27:33] easy and good in the here and now we all
[1:27:36] want things to be easy and good
[1:27:40] they're not going to be
[1:27:43] they're not going to be until
[1:27:46] we're over there God has not ordained it
[1:27:50] to be easy
[1:27:51] and real smooth now he's ordained that
[1:27:56] we go through trials through much
[1:27:57] tribulation we must enter the kingdom
[1:28:01] as it is written oh Paul why are you
[1:28:04] quoting this psalm
[1:28:06] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[1:28:09] long
[1:28:11] we are accounted as sheep for the
[1:28:14] slaughter that doesn't I want to be
[1:28:16] blessed Lord I don't want to be
[1:28:17] accounted as a sheep for the slaughter
[1:28:19] this is the blessing
[1:28:22] this is the blessing and you're we're
[1:28:24] our eyes are so tied unto this life that
[1:28:27] we miss these things
[1:28:29] for thy sake we are every arrow of the
[1:28:33] devil
[1:28:35] every flaming Dart of the devil is
[1:28:38] pointed against us
[1:28:40] and coming against us
[1:28:42] and God has ordained that for your life
[1:28:47] thanks preacher thanks so much I feel
[1:28:50] great you will after in a minute
[1:28:55] were killed we're like sheep for the
[1:28:57] slaughter nay
[1:28:59] why are these two verses together can
[1:29:02] you imagine
[1:29:04] a human being writing this this is God
[1:29:08] through a messenger
[1:29:10] speaking truth to us
[1:29:12] let's not miss this we need to be ready
[1:29:14] for a body change and we're not going to
[1:29:16] do it be ready until we see what a real
[1:29:19] conqueror is
[1:29:21] you're telling me that someone that goes
[1:29:23] through tribulation distress persecution
[1:29:25] famine nakedness Peril and sword is this
[1:29:29] a conqueror
[1:29:32] I'm telling you that
[1:29:34] in all these things we are more than
[1:29:37] conquerors
[1:29:38] through him that loved us it isn't you
[1:29:43] that God is relying on to be a conqueror
[1:29:46] it's through him
[1:29:48] that loved you
[1:29:51] and a conqueror is vastly different
[1:29:54] than a tyrant of this world
[1:29:57] sometimes the greatest conqueror in ages
[1:30:00] past was burned at a stake
[1:30:03] and God says that's my Overcomer that's
[1:30:05] my conqueror what
[1:30:07] how is it possible you're looking at
[1:30:10] just this life
[1:30:13] this body will die or it will get
[1:30:16] changed one or the other
[1:30:18] and this this life is temporary I mean
[1:30:22] think about think about what percentage
[1:30:26] of your life right now
[1:30:30] is it of Eternity
[1:30:32] what percentage calculate that for me
[1:30:34] y'all I need a good calculation Micah
[1:30:37] you could do it for me
[1:30:40] you know what it is it's zero percent
[1:30:45] 50 years of Eternity is zero percent
[1:30:50] because eternity is infinite it doesn't
[1:30:52] end
[1:30:53] there's no ending so your life right now
[1:30:56] is very short and very small if you
[1:31:00] finish this life with faith in Christ in
[1:31:05] your heart you are a conqueror because
[1:31:08] you've just lost zero percent of your
[1:31:11] life
[1:31:14] You're Now set free
[1:31:18] from a body
[1:31:20] of sin and death You're Now set free
[1:31:23] you're now
[1:31:25] entered the Ring of conquerors the
[1:31:30] champions
[1:31:31] the Overcomers
[1:31:33] there's there's there's no greater
[1:31:36] one that God looks to it's not the
[1:31:39] person that is a great conqueror in this
[1:31:41] life Genghis Khan is a big
[1:31:45] compared to you guys
[1:31:49] in God's eyes
[1:31:52] one of the greatest conquerors in
[1:31:54] history and God says he's in hell
[1:31:58] he's he's the fire
[1:32:00] is eating eating him up
[1:32:02] and
[1:32:03] uh polycarp he was burnt for zero
[1:32:07] percent of his life
[1:32:12] isn't that beautiful you really think
[1:32:14] about that this life is a vapor
[1:32:18] yes and regardless of the trials that
[1:32:21] you go through when you get over there
[1:32:22] the first thing
[1:32:24] that you're going to think is why did I
[1:32:27] ever worry
[1:32:28] that's what the prophet told us why did
[1:32:29] I ever worry
[1:32:32] we're killed all the day long
[1:32:35] okay
[1:32:36] no nope
[1:32:39] that's what Paul is saying no
[1:32:42] for the for thy sake we're killed all
[1:32:44] that no
[1:32:46] in all these things we are more than
[1:32:49] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:32:53] look now because of the because of what
[1:32:55] he said and because of what he's written
[1:32:57] four
[1:32:59] because of these things verse 38 I am
[1:33:02] persuaded
[1:33:04] that neither death
[1:33:06] nor life and our angels
[1:33:09] or principalities
[1:33:11] nor powers
[1:33:13] I mean an angel
[1:33:15] remember this an angel
[1:33:18] in just a few moments killed 385
[1:33:21] 000 member military
[1:33:24] so we're talking
[1:33:27] very powerful beings that in an instant
[1:33:31] can kill
[1:33:32] hundreds of thousands of people
[1:33:35] they cannot separate you
[1:33:37] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:33:40] Jesus our lord nor angels nor
[1:33:42] principalities and our powers and our
[1:33:43] things present nor things to come nor
[1:33:46] height nor depth nor any other creature
[1:33:48] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:33:51] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:33:55] lord
[1:33:58] you believe that nothing can separate
[1:34:01] you so when we're saying nothing can
[1:34:03] separate you we hear that quoted but
[1:34:05] remember the context of the verse it's
[1:34:08] circumstances and situations and
[1:34:10] sufferings of this life the very things
[1:34:13] the devil tries to put in your life to
[1:34:15] make you doubt
[1:34:17] make you disbelieve God says that's not
[1:34:19] going to separate you from my love
[1:34:22] when are we going to take that
[1:34:25] when we're going through it and say this
[1:34:28] won't separate me from the love of God
[1:34:29] Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:34:33] can we do that can we take that and be
[1:34:36] that be the Conqueror you're going to be
[1:34:39] so let's just take it now
[1:34:42] that'll change a lot of things if we
[1:34:44] take it now
[1:34:46] but God allows God God
[1:34:50] I love I love I think it was brother
[1:34:51] brother Dale when he said he was going
[1:34:54] into the surgery this is a predestinated
[1:34:56] trial for me and it just just was like a
[1:35:00] it locked me instantly I said my that's
[1:35:04] good I'm going to use that forever
[1:35:06] so this is a predestinated trial
[1:35:09] for me to overcome in
[1:35:12] what if you die brother this is a
[1:35:14] predestinated trial that I have done the
[1:35:17] ultimate overcoming in
[1:35:21] again you know we will have a funeral
[1:35:24] for you and we'll be sad and it'll break
[1:35:25] our heart and we'll you know cry about
[1:35:28] it the rest of our lives probably and
[1:35:30] yet knowing
[1:35:32] knowing you're rejoicing right and we
[1:35:35] should be rejoicing with you let's let's
[1:35:38] have
[1:35:39] eyes on eternity amen musicians if you'd
[1:35:42] come
[1:35:43] I'm just going to read a little bit of a
[1:35:44] quote as you come
[1:35:46] it's a very lengthy one brother Brad if
[1:35:48] you want to bring it up
[1:35:51] it kind of is a summary of everything
[1:35:53] that's been
[1:35:55] said
[1:35:57] it's from the church ages book Sumerian
[1:35:59] Church age how
[1:36:00] how can God be just and loving if he
[1:36:03] stands by and watches as people suffer
[1:36:06] that is what they asked in Malachi 1 1-3
[1:36:08] the burden of the word of the Lord to
[1:36:09] Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith
[1:36:12] the Lord yet you say wherein hast thou
[1:36:14] loved us
[1:36:15] was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the
[1:36:18] Lord yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau
[1:36:21] and laid his mountains in his Heritage
[1:36:23] waste for the dragons of the Wilderness
[1:36:24] you see
[1:36:26] they could not figure out God's love
[1:36:29] they thought that love meant no
[1:36:30] suffering they thought that love meant a
[1:36:33] baby with parental care but God said
[1:36:35] that his love was elective love
[1:36:38] the proof of his love is election
[1:36:41] that no matter what happened his love
[1:36:43] was proven truly by the fact that they
[1:36:45] were chosen unto salvation
[1:36:47] because God has chosen you to Salvation
[1:36:49] through sanctification of the spirit and
[1:36:51] belief of the truth
[1:36:52] he may commit you to death as he did
[1:36:54] Paul he may commit you to suffering as
[1:36:56] he did job this is his prerogative he is
[1:36:58] Sovereign but it is all with a purpose
[1:37:01] if he did not have a purpose then he
[1:37:03] would be the author of frustration and
[1:37:05] not of Peace his purpose is that after
[1:37:07] we have suffered a while we would be
[1:37:09] made perfect be established strengthened
[1:37:11] and settled as job said he put strength
[1:37:15] in US
[1:37:16] you see he himself suffered he learned
[1:37:18] obedience by the things that he suffered
[1:37:20] he was actually made perfect by the
[1:37:22] things that he suffered
[1:37:24] Hebrews 5 8-9 though you were a son he
[1:37:26] had learned he obedience by the things
[1:37:28] which he suffered and being made perfect
[1:37:29] he became the author of Eternal
[1:37:32] salvation to all them that obey him in
[1:37:34] plain language the very character of
[1:37:36] Jesus was perfected by suffering and
[1:37:38] according to Paul
[1:37:41] wow I just lost it all so I'll look up
[1:37:43] there
[1:37:44] uh uh he left has left his church a
[1:37:48] measure of suffering that they too by
[1:37:51] their faith in God while suffering for
[1:37:53] him would come to a place of perfection
[1:37:57] why did he want this James 1 2 and 4 my
[1:38:01] brother encountered all joy when you
[1:38:02] fall into diverse Temptations knowing
[1:38:04] this that the trying of your faith
[1:38:06] worketh patience but let patience have a
[1:38:09] perfect work that you may be perfect an
[1:38:10] entire wanting nothing why does he stand
[1:38:14] by the reason is in Romans 8 17-18 and
[1:38:17] if children then heirs Heirs of God and
[1:38:19] Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:38:22] suffer with him that we may be also
[1:38:24] glorified together for I reckon that the
[1:38:27] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:38:29] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:38:30] which shall be revealed in US unless we
[1:38:33] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[1:38:35] you have to suffer to Reign the reason
[1:38:38] for this is that character simply is
[1:38:40] never made without suffering character
[1:38:42] is a victory not a gift a man without
[1:38:45] character can't Reign because power
[1:38:46] apart from character is satanic but
[1:38:49] Power with character is fit to rule and
[1:38:51] since he wants us to share even his
[1:38:54] throne on the same basis that he
[1:38:56] overcame and set down in his father's
[1:38:58] Throne then we have to overcome to set
[1:39:01] with him
[1:39:02] and the little temporary suffering we go
[1:39:04] through now is not worthy to be compared
[1:39:07] to the tremendous Glory that will be
[1:39:09] revealed in us when he comes oh what
[1:39:12] Treasures are laid up for those who are
[1:39:14] willing to enter into his kingdom
[1:39:16] through much tribulation
[1:39:18] think it not strange concerning the
[1:39:20] fiery trials that are to try you that is
[1:39:22] what Peter said is it strange that God
[1:39:24] wants us to develop a christ-like
[1:39:26] character that comes through suffering
[1:39:28] no sir and we all have trials we all
[1:39:31] have we are all tried and chastened his
[1:39:33] sons not one but goes through that
[1:39:35] church that is not suffering and is not
[1:39:37] being tried hasn't got it it isn't of
[1:39:39] God Hebrews 12 6 and 8 for whom the Lord
[1:39:42] loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every
[1:39:44] son whom you receiveth but if you be
[1:39:46] without chastisement whereof all our
[1:39:48] partakers then are you bastards and not
[1:39:49] Sons
[1:39:51] now this special condition in Smyrna
[1:39:53] must be applied to every age there is no
[1:39:55] age free from it there's no True
[1:39:58] Believer free from it this is of god
[1:40:00] this is the will of God it is needful we
[1:40:03] need the Lord to teach us the truth that
[1:40:04] we are to suffer and be christ-like in
[1:40:06] doing it love suffereth long and is kind
[1:40:09] Matthew 5 11 and 12 blessed are ye when
[1:40:12] men shall revile you and persecute you
[1:40:14] and shall say all manner of evil against
[1:40:16] you falsely for my sake rejoice and be
[1:40:18] exceeding glad for great is your reward
[1:40:20] in heaven for so persecuted they the
[1:40:22] prophets which were before you and how
[1:40:25] shall I prove my love to him
[1:40:27] by believing what he said and by
[1:40:29] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[1:40:32] trials that he and his wisdom allows to
[1:40:35] come to pass I love that
[1:40:39] conducting myself with joy that's a
[1:40:41] challenge
[1:40:42] Trials come
[1:40:44] they're meant to tear you down make you
[1:40:47] feel weak make you feel depressed that's
[1:40:49] what the devil has sent them
[1:40:52] to accomplish but God intends them for
[1:40:55] good if we'll take them with joy
[1:40:58] then they'll accomplish the things that
[1:41:00] they're supposed to accomplish in our
[1:41:01] lives amen let's stand and pray
